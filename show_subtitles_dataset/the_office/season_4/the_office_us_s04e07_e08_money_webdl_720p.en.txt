1
00:00:03,638 --> 00:00:04,662
Coat!

2
00:00:06,074 --> 00:00:08,269
Michael just rented
The Devil Wears Prada.

3
00:00:09,144 --> 00:00:11,442
He has his Netflix
sent here to the office,

4
00:00:11,513 --> 00:00:14,778
and he watches them in
pieces when things are slow.

5
00:00:15,283 --> 00:00:16,545
Steak!

6
00:00:18,687 --> 00:00:20,552
Where's my steak?

7
00:00:20,755 --> 00:00:22,222
He's a big
Meryl Streep fan,

8
00:00:22,290 --> 00:00:25,691
so I shouldn't be surprised that
he's identified with her character.

9
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:27,318
Get me Armani.

10
00:00:27,395 --> 00:00:28,384
A suit?

11
00:00:28,463 --> 00:00:29,896
On the phone.

12
00:00:29,965 --> 00:00:31,023
Like the main
company number?

13
00:00:31,099 --> 00:00:33,158
'Cause I'm gonna have to call information.
Where's Armani?

14
00:00:33,234 --> 00:00:37,193
He's on the phone. Too slow.
You're not going to Paris.

15
00:00:37,272 --> 00:00:38,762
I'm so much
better than you.

16
00:00:52,988 --> 00:00:54,979
I owe you an apology.

17
00:00:55,056 --> 00:00:56,216
You finished the movie.

18
00:00:56,291 --> 00:00:58,759
Yeah. It was awesome.
Big surprise ending.

19
00:00:58,827 --> 00:00:59,851
Won't ruin it for you.

20
00:00:59,928 --> 00:01:01,691
No. Go ahead.

21
00:01:01,763 --> 00:01:04,493
Meryl Streep is the bad guy.
Never see it coming.

22
00:01:04,566 --> 00:01:09,526
Anyway, if I was mean in any
way to you, I am sorry.

23
00:01:10,972 --> 00:01:12,906
I just want what's
best for you, minooshka.

24
00:01:15,410 --> 00:01:16,934
Minooshka.

25
00:01:19,014 --> 00:01:21,915
Mo cuishle. He's watching
Million Dollar Baby.

26
00:01:25,387 --> 00:01:27,412
He's gonna try to kill me.

27
00:02:00,622 --> 00:02:03,022
So this one goes with my eyes, and
this one goes with your eyes.

28
00:02:03,491 --> 00:02:04,981
People have said
I have very pretty eyes.

29
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:06,288
You do.

30
00:02:06,361 --> 00:02:09,489
I haven't heard the same about you.
So let's just go with mine.

31
00:02:09,564 --> 00:02:12,124
Well, they both go with
the carpet that I've ordered,

32
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:15,260
and if we go with the brown leather on
the sofas then they go with that, too.

33
00:02:15,336 --> 00:02:16,928
We already have
a sofa so why are...

34
00:02:17,005 --> 00:02:18,529
A futon's not a sofa.

35
00:02:18,606 --> 00:02:20,597
It folds up.
You've only seen it flat.

36
00:02:20,675 --> 00:02:21,733
I know what
a futon is, Michael.

37
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:24,370
I... Okay. How much
is this gonna cost?

38
00:02:24,446 --> 00:02:25,845
It costs what it costs.

39
00:02:25,914 --> 00:02:27,404
No. That doesn't
even mean anything.

40
00:02:27,482 --> 00:02:29,109
We have gone through this, okay.
We have gone through this.

41
00:02:29,317 --> 00:02:34,254
Yes. Money has been a little bit tight
lately, but at the end of my life,

42
00:02:35,423 --> 00:02:39,325
when I'm sitting on my yacht, am I gonna
be thinking about how much money I have?

43
00:02:39,394 --> 00:02:44,229
No. I'm going to be thinking
about how many friends I have,

44
00:02:44,299 --> 00:02:48,429
and my children
and my comedy albums.

45
00:02:48,503 --> 00:02:52,303
I mean, I have a yacht, so I obviously
did pretty well money-wise.

46
00:02:53,775 --> 00:02:56,608
It's just, you know, you say
it's gonna cost what it...

47
00:02:57,779 --> 00:02:59,804
Yeah? Michael,
it's Ryan for you.

48
00:02:59,881 --> 00:03:02,577
Conniving little runt.
Put him through.

49
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:05,278
Put him through.
Yes? Ryan, my man.

50
00:03:05,353 --> 00:03:07,082
I sent you an e-mail about
the new PowerPoint.

51
00:03:07,155 --> 00:03:08,622
Yes. And thank you
for sending that to me.

52
00:03:08,690 --> 00:03:11,488
I had IT install the updated
PowerPoint on your computer

53
00:03:11,559 --> 00:03:13,186
so you can use it
for the presentation.

54
00:03:13,261 --> 00:03:15,024
I really want people
there using PowerPoint.

55
00:03:15,096 --> 00:03:17,360
Okay. Yeah.
No, I don't know.

56
00:03:17,432 --> 00:03:19,400
I don't know. I think
those IT guys messed up.

57
00:03:19,467 --> 00:03:20,798
Hold on.
I'll get them on the phone.

58
00:03:20,869 --> 00:03:22,564
Wait. No. Here it is.
Here it is. F'ound it.

59
00:03:23,238 --> 00:03:24,364
Sure.
I can hold.

60
00:03:26,074 --> 00:03:28,201
Dunder Mifflin.
Dwight Schrute.

61
00:03:28,276 --> 00:03:29,607
Please hold.

62
00:03:41,789 --> 00:03:44,724
Schrute F'arms, Guten Tag.
How can I help you?

63
00:03:45,693 --> 00:03:49,754
Yes, we have availability on those nights.
How many in your party?

64
00:03:50,331 --> 00:03:55,268
Oh, no. I'm sorry. No king beds.
No queen either.

65
00:03:55,336 --> 00:03:59,534
Well, we make our own mattresses that
don't conform to the traditional sizes.

66
00:03:59,607 --> 00:04:01,472
Closest would be twin.

67
00:04:02,243 --> 00:04:05,508
Thank you so much for calling.
Call back again. Auf Wiedersehen.

68
00:04:08,416 --> 00:04:09,474
Hey, Dwight.

69
00:04:09,551 --> 00:04:11,041
None of your
business, Jim.

70
00:04:11,119 --> 00:04:12,143
You running
a bed and breakfast?

71
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:13,517
It is not a B&B.

72
00:04:13,588 --> 00:04:16,648
Agrotourism is a lot more
than a bed and breakfast.

73
00:04:16,724 --> 00:04:21,855
It consists of tourists coming
to a farm, showing them around,

74
00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:25,024
giving them a bed,
giving them breakfast.

75
00:04:27,335 --> 00:04:29,098
Does the Department
of Health know about this?

76
00:04:29,170 --> 00:04:30,728
I am not telling you anything.

77
00:04:30,805 --> 00:04:32,102
Permits are pending.

78
00:04:33,408 --> 00:04:34,397
Dwight Schrute,
Dunder Mifflin.

79
00:04:34,475 --> 00:04:35,499
Hello.
I'm looking for a room.

80
00:04:35,577 --> 00:04:38,546
Okay. This is a misuse
of company phones.

81
00:04:38,613 --> 00:04:41,047
It says here you
cater to the elderly.

82
00:04:41,115 --> 00:04:42,104
Where did you read that?

83
00:04:42,183 --> 00:04:43,810
Trip Advisor.

84
00:04:45,086 --> 00:04:49,284
Trip Advisor is the lifeblood
of the agrotourism industry.

85
00:04:49,357 --> 00:04:52,349
A couple of bad reviews there,
you may as well close up shop.

86
00:04:52,427 --> 00:04:54,452
That's what took down
the Stalk Inn,

87
00:04:54,529 --> 00:04:56,861
one of the cutest little
asparagus farms you'll ever see.

88
00:04:58,866 --> 00:05:00,857
How many in your party?

89
00:05:00,935 --> 00:05:01,959
Two.

90
00:05:02,036 --> 00:05:05,130
We offer tours of the
fields and of the barn.

91
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:09,642
Perhaps you'd be interested in
Mose's table-making demonstration?

92
00:05:09,711 --> 00:05:12,145
So, I forgot to tell you
that I need the car tonight.

93
00:05:12,213 --> 00:05:15,671
Oh, actually
I need the car.

94
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:17,411
Why? F'or improv?

95
00:05:18,119 --> 00:05:21,316
Why don't you just pretend
that you have a car?

96
00:05:22,156 --> 00:05:26,388
Good practice in case you ever do a scene
where you need to pretend you have a car.

97
00:05:26,461 --> 00:05:30,261
Used to have two cars, traded them in.
Now we're down to one.

98
00:05:30,832 --> 00:05:35,633
Good economic sense, although the
new car's a Porsche, for her.

99
00:05:37,071 --> 00:05:38,436
One cardigan.

100
00:05:40,074 --> 00:05:41,905
One sleeping cardigan.

101
00:05:43,278 --> 00:05:45,075
One sleep apnea mask.

102
00:05:48,549 --> 00:05:50,346
What about my
cherub figurine?

103
00:05:50,418 --> 00:05:51,578
You took that with you.

104
00:05:51,653 --> 00:05:54,178
No. I left it
on my night...

105
00:05:54,255 --> 00:05:56,280
Your night table,
by the lamp.

106
00:05:56,357 --> 00:05:58,222
You are incorrect.

107
00:05:58,293 --> 00:06:01,888
I was recently scrubbing my room of
memories, and I didn't see it there.

108
00:06:03,031 --> 00:06:04,089
F'ine.

109
00:06:04,165 --> 00:06:06,429
My girlfriend
and I broke up recently,

110
00:06:06,501 --> 00:06:09,231
and I must say
I am relieved.

111
00:06:09,304 --> 00:06:11,738
It gives me a chance
to sow my wild oats.

112
00:06:11,806 --> 00:06:13,103
In the Schrute family,

113
00:06:13,174 --> 00:06:16,769
we have a tradition where when the
male has sex with another woman,

114
00:06:16,844 --> 00:06:21,543
he is rewarded with a bag of wild oats
left on his doorstep by his parents.

115
00:06:21,616 --> 00:06:24,983
You can use those oats to make
oatmeal, bread, whatever you want.

116
00:06:25,053 --> 00:06:26,987
I don't care.
They're your oats.

117
00:06:28,056 --> 00:06:32,254
The bar uses an applause meter.
That's why it is so important

118
00:06:32,327 --> 00:06:37,424
that you all come and applaud only
for my band, Scrantonicity II.

119
00:06:37,498 --> 00:06:41,366
Not Scrantonicity, which I
am no longer a part of.

120
00:06:42,036 --> 00:06:44,027
Michael, can I count on you?

121
00:06:44,105 --> 00:06:45,732
You cannot.
I have a thing tonight.

122
00:06:46,107 --> 00:06:47,096
Damn it.

123
00:06:48,843 --> 00:06:50,037
Michael.

124
00:06:50,244 --> 00:06:52,041
What?
That reminds me.

125
00:06:52,113 --> 00:06:54,081
If the invitation
still stands,

126
00:06:54,148 --> 00:06:56,981
Pam and I would love
to have dinner tonight.

127
00:06:57,051 --> 00:06:59,747
Oh, no.
I have a thing tonight.

128
00:07:01,189 --> 00:07:02,520
That stinks.
Darn it.

129
00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:03,784
Shoot.

130
00:07:03,858 --> 00:07:05,826
How about this weekend?
No. Can't.

131
00:07:05,893 --> 00:07:10,330
We only had tonight free, and we
really wanted to spend it with you.

132
00:07:10,398 --> 00:07:13,629
Damn it to hell.
Okay, all right.

133
00:07:13,735 --> 00:07:15,566
What do you got
going on tonight?

134
00:07:16,404 --> 00:07:18,599
You wouldn't understand.
It's a secret.

135
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,431
I wouldn't understand
or it's a secret?

136
00:07:21,509 --> 00:07:24,376
You wouldn't understand, Jim.
It's a secret.

137
00:07:32,286 --> 00:07:35,084
I'm sorry, Mr. O'Brien. I didn't
mean to interrupt your dinner.

138
00:07:35,156 --> 00:07:36,885
I just have a very
exciting offer.

139
00:07:36,958 --> 00:07:41,088
My records indicate that you have
expressed interest in losing some weight.

140
00:07:41,162 --> 00:07:42,220
Well, what if I told you

141
00:07:42,296 --> 00:07:45,697
that I have a pill that will make you
50 pounds lighter in five minutes?

142
00:07:45,767 --> 00:07:47,098
How would that sound?

143
00:07:47,168 --> 00:07:48,328
Amazing, right?

144
00:07:48,436 --> 00:07:51,337
Well, it won't be
that fast, but it will...

145
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:54,101
It will be that easy.

146
00:07:56,644 --> 00:07:59,545
I can't believe
this place is real.

147
00:07:59,614 --> 00:08:02,242
I mean, I've heard about his beet farm
for years, but I never thought...

148
00:08:02,316 --> 00:08:03,544
The Beets Motel.

149
00:08:03,618 --> 00:08:05,518
The Beets Motel?

150
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:07,247
That is... Wow.

151
00:08:07,321 --> 00:08:08,686
Thank you.

152
00:08:09,290 --> 00:08:10,780
The Borscht Hotel.

153
00:08:12,026 --> 00:08:13,687
The Embassy Beets.
Radish Inn.

154
00:08:13,761 --> 00:08:14,785
How are you doing this?

155
00:08:14,862 --> 00:08:16,329
I don't know.

156
00:08:25,206 --> 00:08:26,605
Oh, my gosh.

157
00:08:33,781 --> 00:08:38,582
I just love sales. I love it to death.
It's as simple as that.

158
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:43,820
And I don't get to do enough of it as
a manager, so I took this second job

159
00:08:44,592 --> 00:08:46,253
kind of as a hobby.

160
00:08:46,527 --> 00:08:49,985
Some people have
golf or relaxing...

161
00:08:50,832 --> 00:08:51,992
What's going on here?

162
00:08:52,066 --> 00:08:55,968
Hey. I just got off the phone, and
I was gonna make another call.

163
00:08:56,804 --> 00:08:59,602
We're a legit operation with a license
from the city. I can show you.

164
00:08:59,674 --> 00:09:01,608
We pay minimum wage
against commission.

165
00:09:01,676 --> 00:09:06,909
Nope. They're with me, so... This is
Nick F'igaro, manager to the stars.

166
00:09:08,516 --> 00:09:10,711
We have three rooms,
each with a different theme.

167
00:09:10,785 --> 00:09:12,252
What are the themes?

168
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:15,949
America, Irrigation
and Nighttime.

169
00:09:16,023 --> 00:09:17,012
Irrigation.

170
00:09:17,091 --> 00:09:18,149
Nice.

171
00:09:18,226 --> 00:09:20,456
I'll put you down
for Irrigation.

172
00:09:20,528 --> 00:09:23,725
Now then, do you have any special
needs or dietary restrictions?

173
00:09:23,798 --> 00:09:26,631
Yes. We will be requiring
a bedtime story.

174
00:09:27,368 --> 00:09:28,392
No.

175
00:09:28,903 --> 00:09:30,768
Not even Harry Potter?
No, Jim, come on.

176
00:09:30,838 --> 00:09:34,035
- But you promised...
- Mose, bags, now.

177
00:09:38,679 --> 00:09:41,011
Here we are.
Irrigation room.

178
00:09:41,082 --> 00:09:45,382
A very special room. So I'll come get you
before the table-making demonstration.

179
00:09:45,453 --> 00:09:49,480
And as of this morning, we are completely
wireless here at Schrute F'arms,

180
00:09:49,557 --> 00:09:51,855
but as soon as I find out
where Mose hid all the wires,

181
00:09:51,926 --> 00:09:53,757
we'll get that power back on.

182
00:09:53,828 --> 00:09:55,193
All righty.

183
00:10:00,601 --> 00:10:04,469
Everybody in the conference
room in five minutes.

184
00:10:06,841 --> 00:10:08,934
These meetings are useless.

185
00:10:09,277 --> 00:10:11,745
I just want to remind you
to stick to the script.

186
00:10:11,812 --> 00:10:13,780
It's been proven
to work, so...

187
00:10:18,686 --> 00:10:19,812
Got it?

188
00:10:19,887 --> 00:10:21,445
Very inspirational.

189
00:10:24,425 --> 00:10:27,986
We're offering a $50 bonus tonight to
the guy with the most sales, okay?

190
00:10:28,062 --> 00:10:29,256
Or a woman.

191
00:10:29,330 --> 00:10:31,025
Or a trained seal.

192
00:10:31,098 --> 00:10:35,000
You can make jokes when you've
made a sale there, rookie. Okay?

193
00:10:42,443 --> 00:10:44,536
I'd say one in six.

194
00:10:44,612 --> 00:10:45,772
What?

195
00:10:45,846 --> 00:10:49,509
I thought you asked me what our chances
were of being murdered here tonight.

196
00:10:49,584 --> 00:10:54,214
You know, I just realized this is Pam's
and my first night away together.

197
00:10:55,222 --> 00:10:57,486
I used to play it
over in my head,

198
00:10:57,558 --> 00:11:00,083
and it was just
a little bit different.

199
00:11:00,161 --> 00:11:06,532
Maybe a nice hotel or a
romantic dinner, wine,

200
00:11:06,601 --> 00:11:09,331
but wine that wasn't
made out of beets.

201
00:11:09,704 --> 00:11:11,729
Didn't think Dwight
would be involved at all.

202
00:11:11,806 --> 00:11:15,799
And I always
imagine less manure.

203
00:11:15,876 --> 00:11:19,141
I mean some manure,
just less.

204
00:11:19,213 --> 00:11:20,407
This is beet food.

205
00:11:20,481 --> 00:11:24,247
Mose, what are you doing?
No, Mose. Put the manure down.

206
00:11:24,318 --> 00:11:27,116
Put it down! Do not throw it!
Do not...

207
00:11:27,188 --> 00:11:29,247
Yes, is Mr. Hudson there?

208
00:11:29,323 --> 00:11:30,312
Yeah. Who is this?

209
00:11:30,391 --> 00:11:33,326
Well, I'm just calling because
you responded positively to...

210
00:11:33,394 --> 00:11:34,622
Michael?

211
00:11:35,930 --> 00:11:37,158
Stanley?

212
00:11:37,765 --> 00:11:40,097
Why are you calling
me here at home?

213
00:11:40,167 --> 00:11:42,829
Señor, are you happy with
your long-distance service?

214
00:11:42,903 --> 00:11:46,236
Michael, I know that's you. Why
are you calling me here at home?

215
00:11:47,208 --> 00:11:48,505
Have you...

216
00:11:48,576 --> 00:11:50,510
Have you considered
satellite television?

217
00:11:50,578 --> 00:11:52,808
Michael, I know that's you.
I know your voice.

218
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:53,869
All right.

219
00:11:53,948 --> 00:11:56,075
Why are you calling
me here at home?

220
00:11:57,084 --> 00:11:59,143
When I'm at home,
at night, in my own house,

221
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:02,621
in my sweats drinking some red
wine, watching my mystery stories,

222
00:12:02,690 --> 00:12:04,920
the last thing in
the whole godforsaken world

223
00:12:04,992 --> 00:12:07,722
I want to hear is the
voice of Michael Scott.

224
00:12:07,795 --> 00:12:09,456
Well, your son sounds
like he's really motivated.

225
00:12:09,530 --> 00:12:12,363
I think it's crazy that the
coach won't play him, frankly.

226
00:12:13,734 --> 00:12:14,792
My office.

227
00:12:14,869 --> 00:12:16,302
You bet.

228
00:12:16,370 --> 00:12:19,669
Just dial the number on the
sheet and stick to the script.

229
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:21,901
Say those words
exactly, got it?

230
00:12:21,976 --> 00:12:24,137
I don't know why we have to
keep having this conversation.

231
00:12:24,211 --> 00:12:28,170
Look, I know sales, and I had that sale.
I just needed a few more minutes to...

232
00:12:28,249 --> 00:12:30,410
A few more minutes
is a waste of our time.

233
00:12:30,484 --> 00:12:32,247
It's not a waste of time.
This is a trading game.

234
00:12:32,319 --> 00:12:33,877
No. Look.
You give a quick pitch,

235
00:12:33,954 --> 00:12:36,388
you make the sale, you move on.
That's how Vikram does it.

236
00:12:36,457 --> 00:12:38,254
Vikram doesn't have
my people skills.

237
00:12:38,325 --> 00:12:40,816
Good for Vikram, because he
outsells you every night.

238
00:12:42,630 --> 00:12:45,656
No. Well, I hope
this conversation has helped.

239
00:12:48,969 --> 00:12:51,995
"And Harry saw the white
hand raise its wand

240
00:12:52,073 --> 00:12:54,633
"and felt Voldermort's
surge of vicious anger.

241
00:12:54,709 --> 00:12:57,769
"Saw the frail old man
on the floor writhe in agony.

242
00:12:57,845 --> 00:13:01,303
"'Harry.' It was over
as quickly as it had come.

243
00:13:01,382 --> 00:13:03,145
"Harry stood shaking
in the darkness,

244
00:13:03,217 --> 00:13:06,311
"clutching the gate into the
garden, his heart racing."

245
00:13:09,323 --> 00:13:10,620
What you got tonight?

246
00:13:10,725 --> 00:13:14,354
It looks like mixed masala,
eggplant and rice.

247
00:13:14,428 --> 00:13:16,157
Oh, that looks good.

248
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:19,028
And what about you?
Peanut butter flavor again?

249
00:13:19,934 --> 00:13:23,734
I am going with the vanilla
crisp this evening.

250
00:13:23,804 --> 00:13:24,828
Enjoy.

251
00:13:24,905 --> 00:13:26,304
Thank you.

252
00:13:29,410 --> 00:13:30,934
I was a surgeon back home.

253
00:13:31,011 --> 00:13:32,308
Really?
Yeah.

254
00:13:32,379 --> 00:13:33,471
Wonder what I would
have been back home.

255
00:13:33,547 --> 00:13:35,014
Well, this is your home.

256
00:13:35,082 --> 00:13:39,542
I know, but it's so
competitive here.

257
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:42,088
What's $1 worth
in your land?

258
00:13:42,156 --> 00:13:45,819
Medical school must have cost like
40 bucks or a donkey or something.

259
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:47,655
Uh, no.

260
00:13:50,064 --> 00:13:52,328
I would have been
chief of surgery.

261
00:13:55,603 --> 00:13:57,002
Or a cowboy.

262
00:14:02,576 --> 00:14:03,838
Wait, you're
going out there?

263
00:14:03,911 --> 00:14:05,970
Yeah. Coward.

264
00:14:22,897 --> 00:14:26,162
Oh, my God.
What century is this?

265
00:14:28,369 --> 00:14:30,234
You know what, here's the
thing about Die Hard 4.

266
00:14:30,304 --> 00:14:36,038
Die Hard 1, the original, John McClane
is just this normal guy, you know?

267
00:14:36,110 --> 00:14:38,203
He's just a normal
New York City cop

268
00:14:38,279 --> 00:14:42,716
who gets his feet cut, and he gets
beat up, but he's an everyday guy.

269
00:14:42,817 --> 00:14:48,221
In Die Hard 4, he is jumping a
motorcycle into a helicopter in the air.

270
00:14:48,289 --> 00:14:49,483
Yeah.

271
00:14:49,557 --> 00:14:50,819
You know? He's invincible.

272
00:14:50,891 --> 00:14:54,088
It just sort of lost what Die Hard was.
It's not Terminator.

273
00:14:54,161 --> 00:14:56,561
Dude, you should
review movies.

274
00:14:56,630 --> 00:14:58,188
Oh, my God. Yes.

275
00:14:58,299 --> 00:15:00,358
I'm telling you.
Yeah. You should.

276
00:15:00,434 --> 00:15:01,992
I actually wrote a movie.
Really?

277
00:15:02,069 --> 00:15:03,331
Well, I'm writing one, yeah.

278
00:15:03,404 --> 00:15:04,837
What's it about?

279
00:15:04,905 --> 00:15:06,429
Sort of a spy thriller.

280
00:15:06,507 --> 00:15:08,475
Hey, what's so captivating?

281
00:15:10,244 --> 00:15:12,178
I love captivating things,

282
00:15:12,246 --> 00:15:16,080
and this must really be captivating
because it's keeping you off the phones.

283
00:15:16,150 --> 00:15:19,677
I mean, time is your money. That's
how I know how captivating it is

284
00:15:19,753 --> 00:15:22,278
because of how much time
you've spent talking.

285
00:15:28,662 --> 00:15:29,686
Your turn.

286
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:48,876
Come in. Did you have
another nightmare?

287
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,451
Hey, Dwight.

288
00:15:55,522 --> 00:15:57,683
Oh, Jim.

289
00:15:59,226 --> 00:16:00,750
I thought you were Mose.

290
00:16:00,828 --> 00:16:02,989
Does Mose have nightmares?

291
00:16:03,063 --> 00:16:05,588
Oh, yes.
Ever since the storm.

292
00:16:10,938 --> 00:16:13,168
Is everything satisfactory
with your stay?

293
00:16:13,941 --> 00:16:15,238
Yeah. Yeah.

294
00:16:15,309 --> 00:16:17,106
Great.

295
00:16:17,177 --> 00:16:22,376
Just thought I heard crying or
moaning or something in here.

296
00:16:24,084 --> 00:16:27,076
Oh, well, I'll look into
that in the morning.

297
00:16:29,757 --> 00:16:33,386
Thank you for bringing that
to the attention of the staff.

298
00:16:35,262 --> 00:16:36,524
Good night, Dwight.

299
00:16:53,514 --> 00:16:56,449
Hey, so we're all gonna go out for a beer.
You want to come?

300
00:16:56,517 --> 00:16:57,677
We'd love for you
to come, Michael.

301
00:16:57,751 --> 00:17:00,117
Thanks, no. I have to work
in the morning, so...

302
00:17:00,187 --> 00:17:01,415
All right.
Next time, dude.

303
00:17:01,488 --> 00:17:03,080
Okay. See you guys.

304
00:17:04,358 --> 00:17:07,054
Hey, how you doing?

305
00:17:07,127 --> 00:17:09,595
You drive.
I had too much wine.

306
00:17:09,663 --> 00:17:10,789
Okay.

307
00:17:12,199 --> 00:17:13,496
How was yoga?

308
00:17:13,567 --> 00:17:15,535
I didn't go.
Why?

309
00:17:15,602 --> 00:17:17,536
Why not?
I just didn't.

310
00:17:17,604 --> 00:17:18,628
Okay.

311
00:17:18,706 --> 00:17:20,196
How was improv?

312
00:17:22,810 --> 00:17:24,141
Good night, Vikram.
Good night.

313
00:17:24,211 --> 00:17:25,200
Hey, congrats
on the bonus.

314
00:17:25,279 --> 00:17:26,337
Thank you, Michael.

315
00:17:26,413 --> 00:17:27,744
I'm gonna nab it
one of these nights.

316
00:17:27,815 --> 00:17:31,444
Well, if you concentrate and
make your calls faster, yeah.

317
00:17:33,988 --> 00:17:35,956
Good night.
Good night.

318
00:17:44,031 --> 00:17:45,259
Michael.
Mmm.

319
00:17:47,534 --> 00:17:49,024
Morning.
Hi.

320
00:17:57,511 --> 00:17:59,342
Hey, Dwight.
How are you?

321
00:17:59,413 --> 00:18:00,471
Pam.

322
00:18:02,649 --> 00:18:03,911
You okay?

323
00:18:04,952 --> 00:18:08,251
I am better than you have
ever been or ever will be.

324
00:18:11,258 --> 00:18:15,661
Hey, guys. What's happening?
How's my favorite branch doing?

325
00:18:17,631 --> 00:18:19,656
Okay, Michael, why don't
you start us off?

326
00:18:19,733 --> 00:18:20,722
Um...

327
00:18:21,702 --> 00:18:23,761
That wasn't much
of an introduction.

328
00:18:24,671 --> 00:18:27,333
Ladies and gentlemen,
your boss, Michael Scott.

329
00:18:27,441 --> 00:18:29,705
Oh, still lame. Okay.

330
00:18:30,744 --> 00:18:32,075
All right.

331
00:18:33,414 --> 00:18:37,316
Thank you, Ryan, for that
wonderful introduction.

332
00:18:39,053 --> 00:18:42,887
Okay, today we're
going to be talking

333
00:18:44,425 --> 00:18:47,724
about PowerPoint.

334
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:52,799
PowerPoint. PowerPoint.
PowerPoint.

335
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:57,428
Yes, I forgot about Ryan's presentation,
and yes, it would have been nice

336
00:18:57,504 --> 00:19:00,598
to do well with the first
presentation that he had given me.

337
00:19:00,674 --> 00:19:02,767
But you know what else
would have been nice?

338
00:19:02,843 --> 00:19:05,073
Winning the lottery.

339
00:19:05,145 --> 00:19:09,548
And the best way
to start is to hit "Start,"

340
00:19:09,616 --> 00:19:13,814
and up comes the tool bar,
that's what she said.

341
00:19:13,887 --> 00:19:18,824
What we have to do
here is go to "Run,"

342
00:19:18,892 --> 00:19:25,127
and then you look
up to "PowerPoint."

343
00:19:25,999 --> 00:19:27,796
And we are in.

344
00:19:27,868 --> 00:19:31,531
We are going to register.
You hit "Register."

345
00:19:32,039 --> 00:19:34,166
Updates are ready.
I should update.

346
00:19:37,277 --> 00:19:38,369
"Estimated time 12 minutes."

347
00:19:38,445 --> 00:19:40,777
So this should take
about five or 10 minutes.

348
00:19:40,848 --> 00:19:42,873
Is this the first time
you've opened PowerPoint?

349
00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:44,281
Why?

350
00:19:44,351 --> 00:19:45,909
You didn't prepare a
presentation at all, did you?

351
00:19:45,986 --> 00:19:49,547
No. I had a really rough night, and
my boss can back me up on that.

352
00:19:49,623 --> 00:19:50,851
I'm your boss.

353
00:19:50,924 --> 00:19:52,516
My other boss,
Mr. F'igaro.

354
00:19:52,593 --> 00:19:54,356
You have another job?

355
00:19:54,428 --> 00:19:59,092
What I do between 5:30 p.m. And 1:00 a.m.
Is nobody's business but mine

356
00:19:59,166 --> 00:20:01,157
and my other business'.

357
00:20:01,235 --> 00:20:03,294
Are you a cocktail waitress?

358
00:20:03,370 --> 00:20:05,565
You cannot have
a second job

359
00:20:05,639 --> 00:20:07,732
if it affects your work here.
It won't.

360
00:20:07,808 --> 00:20:08,866
It did already.

361
00:20:08,942 --> 00:20:11,001
Okay, honestly,

362
00:20:11,078 --> 00:20:14,536
it is unlikely that I was
gonna figure this out anyway.

363
00:20:16,783 --> 00:20:17,807
You're so funny.

364
00:20:17,885 --> 00:20:18,909
Why is Darryl here?

365
00:20:18,986 --> 00:20:19,975
He works
in the warehouse.

366
00:20:20,053 --> 00:20:21,042
I invited him.

367
00:20:21,121 --> 00:20:24,488
It's not a party. Darryl, back downstairs.
This isn't information you need.

368
00:20:24,558 --> 00:20:27,994
This information here, yeah,
you're right, I don't need this.

369
00:20:29,062 --> 00:20:30,120
Okay.

370
00:20:31,932 --> 00:20:33,900
Hey, come on.

371
00:20:35,369 --> 00:20:36,336
See you later tonight.

372
00:20:36,403 --> 00:20:37,427
I got plans later.

373
00:20:37,504 --> 00:20:39,131
Okay.
Bye, honey.

374
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:47,374
How long until you actually
get this presentation ready?

375
00:20:47,447 --> 00:20:49,108
Why don't you do the presentation?
Honestly...

376
00:20:49,183 --> 00:20:50,707
Because I don't want... I
mean, you know how to do it.

377
00:20:50,784 --> 00:20:53,480
What I really want, honestly,
Michael, is for you to know it

378
00:20:53,554 --> 00:20:55,351
so that you can communicate
it to the people here,

379
00:20:55,422 --> 00:20:56,855
to your clients,
to whomever.

380
00:20:56,924 --> 00:20:57,982
Okay.

381
00:20:58,058 --> 00:20:59,355
What?

382
00:20:59,426 --> 00:21:00,757
It's whoever,
not whomever.

383
00:21:00,827 --> 00:21:02,055
No, it's whomever.

384
00:21:02,129 --> 00:21:03,756
No. Whomever is
never actually right.

385
00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:04,922
Well, sometimes
it's right.

386
00:21:04,998 --> 00:21:08,263
Michael is right. It's a made-up
word used to trick students.

387
00:21:08,335 --> 00:21:12,135
No. Actually whomever is the
formal version of the word.

388
00:21:12,206 --> 00:21:15,471
Obviously it's a real word, but I
don't know when to use it correctly.

389
00:21:15,542 --> 00:21:17,533
Not a native speaker.
I know what's right,

390
00:21:17,678 --> 00:21:18,906
but I'm not gonna say

391
00:21:18,979 --> 00:21:21,948
because you're all jerks who didn't
come see my band last night.

392
00:21:22,015 --> 00:21:23,004
Do you really know
which one is correct?

393
00:21:23,083 --> 00:21:24,107
I don't know.

394
00:21:24,184 --> 00:21:27,585
It's whom when it's the object of a
sentence and who when it's the subject.

395
00:21:27,654 --> 00:21:29,713
That sounds right. Well, it
sounds right, but is it?

396
00:21:29,790 --> 00:21:31,724
How did Ryan use it? As an object?
As an object.

397
00:21:31,792 --> 00:21:33,350
Ryan used me
as an object.

398
00:21:33,427 --> 00:21:34,621
Is he right about that?

399
00:21:34,695 --> 00:21:35,753
How did he
use it again?

400
00:21:35,829 --> 00:21:40,493
It was Ryan wanted Michael, the subject, to
explain the computer system, the object...

401
00:21:40,567 --> 00:21:42,694
Thank you.
to whomever, meaning us,

402
00:21:42,769 --> 00:21:45,932
the indirect object, which is
the correct usage of the word.

403
00:21:46,006 --> 00:21:50,204
No one asked you anything, ever.
So whomever's name is Toby,

404
00:21:50,277 --> 00:21:52,609
why don't you take a letter opener
and stick it in your skull?

405
00:21:52,679 --> 00:21:55,614
Hey, this doesn't matter,
and I don't even care.

406
00:21:55,682 --> 00:21:58,549
Michael, you quit the other
job or you're fired here.

407
00:22:02,856 --> 00:22:05,290
I've never done this before.

408
00:22:05,359 --> 00:22:08,795
I have never quit
anything in my life.

409
00:22:09,997 --> 00:22:13,592
So you are filming history.

410
00:22:13,667 --> 00:22:17,296
Nick, I had a dream last night
that I had two full-time jobs.

411
00:22:18,071 --> 00:22:21,131
One here at the lipaphadrazone
diet pill company.

412
00:22:21,208 --> 00:22:23,108
Lipophedrine.
And in the other,

413
00:22:23,210 --> 00:22:27,169
I was a regional manager of a small paper
supply company called Dunder Mifflin.

414
00:22:27,247 --> 00:22:28,271
Never heard of it.

415
00:22:28,348 --> 00:22:29,372
In this dream,

416
00:22:29,449 --> 00:22:35,615
I did both of these jobs beautifully
and I loved it and everybody loved me.

417
00:22:35,689 --> 00:22:38,988
The truth is,
I can't do this.

418
00:22:39,059 --> 00:22:40,686
Are you quitting?

419
00:22:41,928 --> 00:22:43,293
I am.

420
00:22:43,363 --> 00:22:47,060
Come back anytime. Don't forget
to disinfect your headset.

421
00:22:48,769 --> 00:22:51,203
I was never in this
for the money.

422
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:57,270
But it turns out that the money
was an absolute necessity for me.

423
00:22:57,744 --> 00:23:02,113
I tried to live the dream, I tried
to have a job, a girlfriend,

424
00:23:03,216 --> 00:23:05,741
another job, and I failed.

425
00:23:07,454 --> 00:23:12,653
But the good thing about the American
dream is that you can just go to sleep

426
00:23:14,328 --> 00:23:16,853
and try it all again
the next night.

427
00:23:23,904 --> 00:23:25,428
So...

428
00:23:28,241 --> 00:23:29,230
What's up?

429
00:23:29,309 --> 00:23:30,401
Me. All night.

430
00:23:30,477 --> 00:23:32,968
Dreaming about Angela's
smoking hot body.

431
00:23:33,046 --> 00:23:34,138
You're being gross.

432
00:23:34,214 --> 00:23:36,182
Not from
a male perspective.

433
00:23:36,249 --> 00:23:39,548
You need to set me up with her. I
know she told you that she's looking,

434
00:23:39,619 --> 00:23:42,087
and she's totally not
responding to my moves.

435
00:23:42,155 --> 00:23:43,179
What moves?

436
00:23:43,256 --> 00:23:46,316
I have moonwalked past
accounting like 10 times.

437
00:23:46,393 --> 00:23:47,655
I can't believe
that's not working.

438
00:23:47,728 --> 00:23:48,717
Yeah.

439
00:23:48,795 --> 00:23:49,784
Um...

440
00:23:50,964 --> 00:23:53,228
I don't know if I really
see you two together.

441
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:58,033
Really? Well, maybe you should look
in the smart part of your brain.

442
00:23:58,105 --> 00:23:59,265
She's very religious.

443
00:23:59,339 --> 00:24:03,969
Okay, well, I come from a line of
WASPs so long it leads back to Moses.

444
00:24:04,044 --> 00:24:08,242
Okay, well, she takes her convictions pretty
seriously. She can be kind of severe.

445
00:24:08,315 --> 00:24:10,249
Yeah, and I punched
a hole in a wall.

446
00:24:10,317 --> 00:24:12,285
That's right. You did. Yeah.

447
00:24:12,352 --> 00:24:16,220
Now that I think about it, Angela and
Andy might actually make a good couple.

448
00:24:17,758 --> 00:24:19,623
But I couldn't
do that to Dwight.

449
00:24:19,926 --> 00:24:21,393
Or Angela.

450
00:24:22,462 --> 00:24:23,793
Or Andy.

451
00:24:27,634 --> 00:24:31,001
Hey, Kevin,
you're a gambler, right?

452
00:24:32,472 --> 00:24:36,738
A rounder? You play the
ponies, small horses?

453
00:24:37,911 --> 00:24:39,208
I do gamble, Michael.

454
00:24:39,312 --> 00:24:42,748
Yeah. I was thinking about
doing some gambling myself.

455
00:24:42,816 --> 00:24:44,511
You know, just a
little bit of money.

456
00:24:44,618 --> 00:24:48,110
Maybe doubling it, then
doubling it several more times.

457
00:24:48,188 --> 00:24:50,713
I don't know,
kind of just for fun.

458
00:24:50,791 --> 00:24:55,694
I was thinking, do you have any
tips or ideas about sure things?

459
00:24:56,630 --> 00:24:59,622
Like a boxer

460
00:24:59,699 --> 00:25:03,965
who is gonna throw
the big fight?

461
00:25:04,037 --> 00:25:07,803
You know, like he's tied
into some crooked dealings

462
00:25:07,874 --> 00:25:11,867
and maybe his kid is sick or something?
Like, who do I call about that?

463
00:25:13,246 --> 00:25:14,440
The mob.

464
00:25:16,249 --> 00:25:18,149
Do you know
anybody in the mob?

465
00:25:20,987 --> 00:25:22,079
Okay.

466
00:25:25,192 --> 00:25:26,386
Oscar,

467
00:25:27,327 --> 00:25:30,626
I'm gonna need to take another
advance on my salary.

468
00:25:31,064 --> 00:25:32,691
What do you mean
you have plans tonight?

469
00:25:32,766 --> 00:25:35,758
I have my daughter tonight.
We're renting Charlotte's Web.

470
00:25:35,836 --> 00:25:37,326
Well, you have
to make a choice.

471
00:25:37,404 --> 00:25:38,871
It's either your
daughter or me.

472
00:25:38,939 --> 00:25:40,463
My daughter.

473
00:25:41,074 --> 00:25:42,063
Okay.

474
00:25:43,243 --> 00:25:44,870
That's how it is.

475
00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:47,769
Oops!

476
00:25:52,052 --> 00:25:53,542
That was cold.

477
00:25:59,893 --> 00:26:01,952
He's always been
terrible with money.

478
00:26:02,028 --> 00:26:04,826
I bet it's Jan spending him
straight to the poorhouse.

479
00:26:04,898 --> 00:26:07,093
Yeah.
Women be shopping.

480
00:26:07,167 --> 00:26:09,328
I can't believe he
has a second job.

481
00:26:09,402 --> 00:26:10,767
He's not even good
at his first one.

482
00:26:10,837 --> 00:26:12,065
Hey, guys.

483
00:26:12,138 --> 00:26:13,127
Shh.

484
00:26:15,775 --> 00:26:17,868
What you talking about?

485
00:26:18,578 --> 00:26:22,639
Okay. I know what's going on.
You're talking about Jim and Pam,

486
00:26:22,716 --> 00:26:23,876
if they're having sex,

487
00:26:23,950 --> 00:26:25,474
what it looks like, and I think...
Michael.

488
00:26:25,552 --> 00:26:27,042
Hey, hey, hey.

489
00:26:28,255 --> 00:26:31,418
Michael, are you
having money problems?

490
00:26:31,491 --> 00:26:33,891
Monkey problems? No, I'm not
having monkey problems.

491
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:35,587
Why would I have
monkey problems?

492
00:26:35,662 --> 00:26:36,822
I know you
heard me correctly.

493
00:26:36,897 --> 00:26:38,387
Oh, I hate monkeys.

494
00:26:38,498 --> 00:26:41,331
What's going on? Why do
you have a second job?

495
00:26:41,401 --> 00:26:43,198
I don't have a second job.

496
00:26:43,270 --> 00:26:47,604
Maybe I am having an affair
with Suzanne Somers.

497
00:26:47,674 --> 00:26:48,902
Doesn't Jan have money?

498
00:26:48,975 --> 00:26:50,533
I don't talk to my
girlfriend about money.

499
00:26:50,610 --> 00:26:52,305
It is rude and unsexual.

500
00:26:52,379 --> 00:26:53,403
True.

501
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:55,812
It's best to hide our money
problems from women.

502
00:26:55,882 --> 00:27:00,182
I totally agree with you, but
I don't have money problems.

503
00:27:00,253 --> 00:27:02,847
All right, you know what?
Watch this.

504
00:27:05,191 --> 00:27:08,786
If I had money problems,
would I do this?

505
00:27:17,304 --> 00:27:18,293
Well...

506
00:27:18,371 --> 00:27:19,395
You just put
it back in your pocket.

507
00:27:19,472 --> 00:27:20,564
Yeah.

508
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:23,734
Yeah, but I destroyed it.
It's not even useable anymore.

509
00:27:27,647 --> 00:27:30,047
Hey, let's call
this what it is.

510
00:27:32,385 --> 00:27:35,843
It's like she only wants to
hook up when Ryan comes around.

511
00:27:35,922 --> 00:27:37,514
It's gotten to the point
where I get excited

512
00:27:37,591 --> 00:27:40,856
every time I see that little
dude walk through the door.

513
00:27:41,494 --> 00:27:44,588
Well, I just need to know
where this is going.

514
00:27:44,664 --> 00:27:47,224
Hey, I like you.

515
00:27:48,568 --> 00:27:49,557
All right?

516
00:27:49,936 --> 00:27:51,699
What's not to like?

517
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:56,900
But you need to access
your un-crazy side.

518
00:27:56,977 --> 00:27:59,969
Otherwise maybe this thing
has run its course.

519
00:28:01,982 --> 00:28:04,473
Don't you dare walk away
from me, Darryl Philbin.

520
00:28:04,551 --> 00:28:05,609
You are the most
selfish person

521
00:28:05,685 --> 00:28:07,084
I have ever
met in my entire...

522
00:28:07,153 --> 00:28:09,417
Slow down.
Think it over.

523
00:28:11,324 --> 00:28:15,522
Darryl Philbin is the most
complicated man that I've ever met.

524
00:28:15,595 --> 00:28:18,587
I mean, who says exactly
what they're thinking?

525
00:28:20,166 --> 00:28:22,066
What kind of game is that?

526
00:28:25,038 --> 00:28:28,530
Hey, cuz. Heard you're
having money problems.

527
00:28:28,608 --> 00:28:29,768
No, you didn't.

528
00:28:29,843 --> 00:28:31,242
Listen,
I got the answer.

529
00:28:31,311 --> 00:28:34,644
You declare bankruptcy,
all your problems go away.

530
00:28:34,714 --> 00:28:36,477
Creed Bratton has never
declared bankruptcy.

531
00:28:36,549 --> 00:28:38,176
When Creed Bratton
gets in trouble,

532
00:28:38,251 --> 00:28:42,312
he transfers his debt
to William Charles Schneider.

533
00:28:42,522 --> 00:28:46,219
How would that help, Creed? In
Monopoly, you go bankrupt, you lose.

534
00:28:46,326 --> 00:28:49,887
You don't go by Monopoly, man.
That game is nuts.

535
00:28:49,963 --> 00:28:53,160
Nobody just picks up
Get Out of Jail F'ree cards.

536
00:28:53,233 --> 00:28:55,133
Those things
cost thousands.

537
00:28:56,002 --> 00:28:57,526
That is a good point.

538
00:28:57,604 --> 00:29:00,437
Bankruptcy, Michael,
is nature's do-over.

539
00:29:00,507 --> 00:29:02,941
It's a fresh start.
It's a clean slate.

540
00:29:03,009 --> 00:29:04,840
Like the witness
protection program.

541
00:29:04,911 --> 00:29:06,708
Exactly.
Not at all.

542
00:29:07,781 --> 00:29:10,750
I've always wanted to be in the
witness protection program.

543
00:29:10,817 --> 00:29:13,615
F'resh start.
No debts, no baggage.

544
00:29:13,687 --> 00:29:18,090
I've already got my name picked
out, Lord Rupert Everton.

545
00:29:18,158 --> 00:29:22,857
I'm a shipping merchant
who raises fancy dogs.

546
00:29:22,929 --> 00:29:24,521
That's the life.

547
00:29:30,336 --> 00:29:35,535
I declare bankruptcy!

548
00:29:45,752 --> 00:29:47,947
Hey. I just wanted
you to know

549
00:29:48,021 --> 00:29:51,479
that you can't just say the word
bankruptcy and expect anything to happen.

550
00:29:51,558 --> 00:29:53,492
I didn't say it.
I declared it.

551
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:56,051
Still.
That's not anything.

552
00:29:57,464 --> 00:29:59,261
This is a lot of
credit card debt.

553
00:29:59,332 --> 00:30:00,890
Yeah. Tell me about it.

554
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:06,131
You know, Jan has my credit cards, and
she's using them as if I'm made of money.

555
00:30:06,206 --> 00:30:08,766
She thinks I'm
a human ATM machine.

556
00:30:09,409 --> 00:30:11,377
Okay, $125 at Amazon.

557
00:30:12,445 --> 00:30:15,437
Oh, best of The Muppet Show on DVD.
Classic.

558
00:30:16,516 --> 00:30:19,349
$1,200. What's a Core
Blaster Extreme?

559
00:30:19,486 --> 00:30:23,445
That is by far the best way
to strengthen your core.

560
00:30:23,523 --> 00:30:28,688
This machine, you sit on a stabilizer ball,
you put your feet into the power stirrups,

561
00:30:28,762 --> 00:30:31,230
you reach up and you
grab onto the super rod,

562
00:30:31,297 --> 00:30:36,826
and you twist and you twist and you twist.
It strengthens your entire core,

563
00:30:36,903 --> 00:30:41,806
your back core,
your arm core, your...

564
00:30:41,875 --> 00:30:46,209
The Marine Corps actually uses it.
I think that's how they got corps.

565
00:30:51,384 --> 00:30:54,251
I left a little
present for Angela.

566
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:56,447
I think she's
going to like it

567
00:30:56,523 --> 00:30:59,788
'cause I found it outside
Vance Refrigeration all alone,

568
00:30:59,859 --> 00:31:03,920
and I told her in the note
that the cat came to find her,

569
00:31:03,997 --> 00:31:06,693
that they were
destined to be together.

570
00:31:10,103 --> 00:31:11,468
I got game.

571
00:31:17,110 --> 00:31:20,910
Okay, the green bar is what you spend
every month on stuff you need,

572
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:22,880
like a car and a house.

573
00:31:22,949 --> 00:31:26,009
That's so cool how you
have my name at the top.

574
00:31:27,654 --> 00:31:31,647
The red bar is what you
spend on non-essentials,

575
00:31:31,724 --> 00:31:33,521
like magazines, entertainment.
Right.

576
00:31:33,593 --> 00:31:35,026
Things like that.

577
00:31:35,128 --> 00:31:41,795
This scary black bar is what you spend
on things that no one ever, ever needs,

578
00:31:41,868 --> 00:31:44,996
like multiple magic sets,
professional bass fishing equipment.

579
00:31:45,071 --> 00:31:48,234
How did you do this so fast?
Is this PowerPoint?

580
00:31:58,351 --> 00:31:59,579
Oh, man.

581
00:32:01,154 --> 00:32:05,853
Angela really had
a hold on him. Angela.

582
00:32:05,925 --> 00:32:08,519
Michael, I'm gonna set you and
Jan up with a debt consolidator.

583
00:32:08,595 --> 00:32:09,857
You meet with this guy...
No. No.

584
00:32:09,929 --> 00:32:12,659
We are going to
leave Jan out of this.

585
00:32:12,732 --> 00:32:13,960
She has to know.

586
00:32:14,033 --> 00:32:15,523
We will find
another way.

587
00:32:15,602 --> 00:32:17,627
We'll ask PowerPoint.

588
00:32:17,704 --> 00:32:19,194
Michael, this is a
presentation tool.

589
00:32:19,272 --> 00:32:22,639
You're a presentation tool if you
think I'm gonna tell Jan about this.

590
00:32:22,709 --> 00:32:24,904
I'm done. No, you're not...
Okay. Just...

591
00:32:24,978 --> 00:32:28,175
You're not a tool. Look, we'll
tell her that it's bad,

592
00:32:28,248 --> 00:32:32,810
but it could have been a lot worse, but
due to some fancy financial footwork,

593
00:32:32,886 --> 00:32:35,013
I was able to
cut it in half.

594
00:32:36,389 --> 00:32:37,913
Jan is smart.

595
00:32:37,991 --> 00:32:39,117
She poses.

596
00:32:42,962 --> 00:32:44,953
Dwight, how's the
hotel business?

597
00:32:45,031 --> 00:32:46,362
Stupid.

598
00:32:47,767 --> 00:32:49,758
Have you checked
Trip Advisor recently?

599
00:32:49,836 --> 00:32:51,064
No.

600
00:32:52,538 --> 00:32:54,267
Maybe you should.

601
00:32:54,340 --> 00:32:57,503
Maybe you should...
Whatever.

602
00:33:01,047 --> 00:33:04,244
We wrote a good review.
Under "Comments," we wrote,

603
00:33:04,317 --> 00:33:07,047
"The natural aroma of the beets
drifts into the bedrooms

604
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:09,315
"and makes you dream
of simpler times."

605
00:33:09,389 --> 00:33:13,018
"The dawn goose walk will
tug at your heart strings."

606
00:33:13,092 --> 00:33:15,959
"Table-making
never seemed so possible."

607
00:33:16,029 --> 00:33:19,089
"You will never
want to leave your room."

608
00:33:19,165 --> 00:33:22,828
"The architecture reminds one
of a quaint Tuscan beet farm."

609
00:33:27,774 --> 00:33:29,401
I'm glad you
enjoyed your stay.

610
00:33:29,475 --> 00:33:31,602
We really did.
It was fun.

611
00:33:37,383 --> 00:33:42,616
So due to Michael's
clever financial maneuvering,

612
00:33:42,689 --> 00:33:45,624
he finds himself
tremendously in debt.

613
00:33:45,692 --> 00:33:47,216
You're broke?

614
00:33:48,561 --> 00:33:50,859
How did you get that
from what Oscar said?

615
00:33:50,930 --> 00:33:53,592
How... I mean, Michael,
how did this happen?

616
00:33:53,666 --> 00:33:55,896
Where exactly did
your money go?

617
00:33:56,369 --> 00:34:00,999
I don't... I don't get this.
I really don't. I don't...

618
00:34:01,074 --> 00:34:07,343
I don't understand how you
could be so irresponsible.

619
00:34:07,413 --> 00:34:12,942
I mean, it is
astounding to me, really.

620
00:34:13,052 --> 00:34:14,314
I don't know what
more to say, it's just...

621
00:34:14,387 --> 00:34:15,911
Jan?

622
00:34:15,989 --> 00:34:18,014
Yeah? What?
Michael left.

623
00:34:19,592 --> 00:34:21,253
Okay.
Where did he go?

624
00:34:21,327 --> 00:34:22,885
I don't know.

625
00:34:23,930 --> 00:34:26,023
Well, is he
coming right back?

626
00:34:26,099 --> 00:34:27,828
I don't think so.

627
00:34:30,236 --> 00:34:31,999
I'll be right there.

628
00:34:48,855 --> 00:34:52,985
What am I doing?
I am blowing Dodge.

629
00:34:53,059 --> 00:34:56,028
I'm getting out of town.

630
00:34:56,095 --> 00:34:59,622
Whatever you call it, I am running
away from my responsibilities.

631
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,490
It feels good.

632
00:35:07,273 --> 00:35:09,138
You may ask me
out to dinner.

633
00:35:11,277 --> 00:35:15,839
Nothing fancy or foreign. No bars, no
patios, no vegetables and no seafood.

634
00:35:24,357 --> 00:35:25,551
Dwight?

635
00:35:49,182 --> 00:35:51,844
Did I ever tell you why
I left Scranton?

636
00:35:54,887 --> 00:35:56,980
Yeah, I didn't
think I had.

637
00:35:57,490 --> 00:36:00,482
Well, it was all
about Pam.

638
00:36:03,596 --> 00:36:08,056
Yeah. I mean,
she was with Roy,

639
00:36:09,502 --> 00:36:11,493
and I just
couldn't take it.

640
00:36:13,106 --> 00:36:15,097
I mean,
I lost it, Dwight.

641
00:36:16,843 --> 00:36:21,507
I couldn't sleep. I couldn't
concentrate on anything.

642
00:36:23,950 --> 00:36:28,512
And weird stuff,
like food had no taste.

643
00:36:30,823 --> 00:36:33,121
So my solution was
to move away.

644
00:36:35,328 --> 00:36:36,795
It was awful.

645
00:36:38,531 --> 00:36:42,228
And it is something that I
wouldn't wish on my worst enemy.

646
00:36:45,938 --> 00:36:47,803
And that includes you.

647
00:37:23,476 --> 00:37:25,706
Hey, I was thinking
about dinner, we...

648
00:37:31,184 --> 00:37:34,847
Dinner. Let's see,
maybe we should try

649
00:37:34,921 --> 00:37:37,048
the new Italian place where
the dry cleaner used to be.

650
00:37:37,123 --> 00:37:38,181
Okay.
Yeah?

651
00:37:38,257 --> 00:37:40,157
Yeah.
Okay.

652
00:37:42,795 --> 00:37:45,889
Jim's just really passionate
about Italian food.

653
00:37:47,934 --> 00:37:51,700
Yeah. I'm very passionate
about Italian food.

654
00:37:53,839 --> 00:37:57,798
In fact, I'm in love
with Italian food.

655
00:38:06,786 --> 00:38:08,014
Jan, he went
running that way.

656
00:38:08,087 --> 00:38:10,214
Okay, great.
Thanks.

657
00:38:13,125 --> 00:38:17,152
Runaway train,
never coming back

658
00:38:18,164 --> 00:38:21,156
Run away
and I'm never coming back

659
00:38:21,234 --> 00:38:22,496
Michael?

660
00:38:23,436 --> 00:38:24,664
Hey, Jan.

661
00:38:27,006 --> 00:38:28,598
What's going on?

662
00:38:29,575 --> 00:38:32,601
Not much.
What's up with you?

663
00:38:32,678 --> 00:38:34,077
Well, why are you
sitting on a train?

664
00:38:34,146 --> 00:38:35,238
Where are you going?

665
00:38:35,314 --> 00:38:37,111
I am out
of answers, Jan.

666
00:38:37,183 --> 00:38:38,650
What does that mean?

667
00:38:38,718 --> 00:38:40,913
I told you.
No more answers.

668
00:38:42,088 --> 00:38:43,919
This is who I am now.

669
00:38:45,691 --> 00:38:48,057
A guy on a train
with no answers.

670
00:38:48,661 --> 00:38:50,322
I hope that can be
enough for you.

671
00:38:50,396 --> 00:38:52,762
Michael, come on.

672
00:38:52,865 --> 00:38:55,060
Running away from your
problems won't solve anything.

673
00:38:55,134 --> 00:38:56,726
You know that.
I don't know that.

674
00:38:56,802 --> 00:38:59,134
Your creditors can follow
you anywhere with ease.

675
00:38:59,205 --> 00:39:02,038
Your debt follows you around
the world, electronically.

676
00:39:02,108 --> 00:39:03,871
I'll stay off the grid.

677
00:39:03,943 --> 00:39:05,433
Michael, come on.

678
00:39:05,511 --> 00:39:08,776
Come on. You can deal with this.
It's not that bad.

679
00:39:09,849 --> 00:39:11,248
Yeah, it is.

680
00:39:12,818 --> 00:39:15,844
It is.
I really messed up.

681
00:39:17,857 --> 00:39:19,051
Well...

682
00:39:20,726 --> 00:39:21,920
When...

683
00:39:22,862 --> 00:39:25,763
When my life fell apart and
they screwed me in New York

684
00:39:25,831 --> 00:39:29,392
and I felt like my whole world was
collapsing around me, I didn't have anyone.

685
00:39:29,468 --> 00:39:33,063
I mean, my whole family still won't even
talk to me on the advice of counsel,

686
00:39:33,139 --> 00:39:36,802
and my friends were just
waiting for this to happen.

687
00:39:36,876 --> 00:39:38,707
That's really
nice of you to say.

688
00:39:38,778 --> 00:39:43,078
Michael, no. What I want to
say is you were there for me,

689
00:39:44,717 --> 00:39:46,082
by my side,

690
00:39:47,219 --> 00:39:49,119
without even a thought.

691
00:39:50,423 --> 00:39:52,357
That's just who you are.

692
00:39:56,495 --> 00:40:02,900
I mean, no matter
how badly I treat you

693
00:40:02,968 --> 00:40:06,961
or what I'm going through, you just...
You are there for me,

694
00:40:07,039 --> 00:40:10,566
and that is a guy
worth staying beside.

695
00:40:13,112 --> 00:40:15,171
So where is this
train taking us?

696
00:40:19,785 --> 00:40:20,774
I...

697
00:40:21,620 --> 00:40:23,611
I think the engineer left.

698
00:40:56,055 --> 00:40:58,421
Hello, this is Dwight Schrute
calling from Dunder Mifflin,

699
00:40:58,491 --> 00:41:02,791
and according to our records, you
appear to be low on office supplies.

700
00:41:02,862 --> 00:41:05,763
Okay. Sure. Yeah. I can take
care of that right now.

701
00:41:08,100 --> 00:41:10,034
Don't sell your
implants, please.

702
00:41:10,102 --> 00:41:12,434
I'm keeping them.
I know you like them.

703
00:41:16,008 --> 00:41:17,441
They're kind of
uncomfortable, though.

704
00:41:17,510 --> 00:41:19,410
It's nice, though. Looks cute.
Kind of painful,

705
00:41:19,478 --> 00:41:21,571
and my nipples aren't as sensitive now.
Looks cute, though.
