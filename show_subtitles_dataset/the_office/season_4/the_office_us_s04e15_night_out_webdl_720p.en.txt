1
00:00:07,405 --> 00:00:08,705
What's wrong, Michael?

2
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:10,461
I got gum in my hair.

3
00:00:10,535 --> 00:00:11,559
You do.

4
00:00:11,636 --> 00:00:13,934
This just stinks.

5
00:00:14,005 --> 00:00:15,563
Don't touch it.
Please, don't touch it!

6
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:16,664
You've got a ton
of dandruff.

7
00:00:16,741 --> 00:00:17,799
Okay, let me be.

8
00:00:17,876 --> 00:00:18,934
How'd you get
gum in your hair?

9
00:00:19,010 --> 00:00:21,570
I was walking in and I noticed
something shiny under Stanley's car,

10
00:00:21,646 --> 00:00:25,912
and I'd gotten under to see what
it was, and I messed up my hair.

11
00:00:25,984 --> 00:00:28,043
All for a stupid
piece of tin foil.

12
00:00:28,119 --> 00:00:30,417
But, best-case scenario, you
thought it was a quarter.

13
00:00:30,488 --> 00:00:31,955
Kill me, right now.

14
00:00:32,023 --> 00:00:34,218
We have peanut butter
in the kitchen.

15
00:00:34,392 --> 00:00:37,054
I don't feel like peanut butter.
Get me an ice cream sandwich.

16
00:00:37,128 --> 00:00:40,529
Nope, not for you, it's for your hair.
And it is 9:00 a.m.

17
00:00:41,433 --> 00:00:44,129
No, Dwight, not the good peanut butter.
People are gonna get mad.

18
00:00:44,202 --> 00:00:46,898
Hey, hey, hey. This is my
hair we're talking about.

19
00:00:49,407 --> 00:00:50,840
Smells good.

20
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:53,134
Tastes good, too.

21
00:00:53,211 --> 00:00:55,111
Oh, don't, that's disgusting.

22
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:56,879
Wow, a lot of calories.

23
00:00:56,948 --> 00:00:59,212
Well, just don't
leave it on too long.

24
00:00:59,684 --> 00:01:01,618
Keep massaging, please.

25
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:04,149
Oh, yeah, that's nice.

26
00:01:40,225 --> 00:01:42,557
Hey, Michael, how was
your date last night?

27
00:01:44,129 --> 00:01:47,030
I will be honest. The dating
has not been going well.

28
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:50,698
Look, men are
visual creatures.

29
00:01:51,336 --> 00:01:57,571
We crave beauty. Like a
piece of fine art by

30
00:01:59,244 --> 00:02:01,838
any number of
renowned artists.

31
00:02:01,913 --> 00:02:07,579
Or an arty photograph
of Cindy Crawford nude.

32
00:02:07,886 --> 00:02:11,083
That, but the women I'm
getting fixed up with are...

33
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:17,293
Not that they aren't nice or
have great personalities,

34
00:02:17,362 --> 00:02:21,423
they just, they just lack
a certain Crawfordness.

35
00:02:22,333 --> 00:02:25,166
I am livid.
Absolutely livid.

36
00:02:25,236 --> 00:02:26,328
It's ridiculous.

37
00:02:26,404 --> 00:02:29,032
Yes, I'm having the Scranton
branch come in on one Saturday,

38
00:02:29,107 --> 00:02:31,541
so they can re-enter sales
that they made on the phone

39
00:02:31,609 --> 00:02:34,806
as sales made by the website, which
they should've done in the first place,

40
00:02:39,684 --> 00:02:42,619
My favorite branch.
How's everybody doing?

41
00:02:43,555 --> 00:02:44,988
Hey, man, do you mind if
I run something by you?

42
00:02:45,056 --> 00:02:47,024
Love it! Go.

43
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:51,186
Well, I kind of feel like what we have
going for us is our customer service.

44
00:02:51,429 --> 00:02:53,590
And no matter how much
we change this up,

45
00:02:53,665 --> 00:02:56,293
I don't know that a website's
gonna be able to replace that.

46
00:02:56,367 --> 00:02:58,528
I can tell you've thought about this a lot.
I appreciate that.

47
00:02:58,603 --> 00:02:59,592
Thanks.

48
00:02:59,671 --> 00:03:00,729
David Wallace does, too.

49
00:03:00,805 --> 00:03:03,968
You told him all about this
at the Christmas party, right?

50
00:03:05,777 --> 00:03:06,801
Did I?

51
00:03:06,878 --> 00:03:08,038
You did, yeah.

52
00:03:08,113 --> 00:03:09,102
Hmm.

53
00:03:10,482 --> 00:03:12,006
Watch your back, Jim.

54
00:03:13,084 --> 00:03:14,449
I'm just kidding.

55
00:03:18,156 --> 00:03:20,750
Ladies and gentlemen, may I
have your attention, please?

56
00:03:20,825 --> 00:03:23,020
I know that a lot of you
are very angry with Ryan,

57
00:03:23,094 --> 00:03:25,153
because he is the reason we
all have to come in tomorrow.

58
00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:30,258
However, I swear to God, if any
of you hurts him in any way

59
00:03:30,368 --> 00:03:32,495
emotionally, or taunts him,

60
00:03:32,570 --> 00:03:36,131
or makes fun of his
height or his half-beard...

61
00:03:36,207 --> 00:03:38,471
Okay. Thanks, Michael.
He... Yeah.

62
00:03:38,543 --> 00:03:39,737
I'm here today

63
00:03:39,811 --> 00:03:42,780
to do some creative problem solving
about Dunder Mifflin Infinity

64
00:03:42,847 --> 00:03:44,781
and field your
questions. Question.

65
00:03:44,849 --> 00:03:45,838
Dwight.

66
00:03:45,917 --> 00:03:46,941
Why am I being forced
to come in tomorrow

67
00:03:47,018 --> 00:03:49,145
and pretend that a website
made sales that I made?

68
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:52,417
This is a temporary measure to
increase the legitimacy of the site.

69
00:03:52,490 --> 00:03:55,152
I don't like when my clients call
me to help them use the website.

70
00:03:55,226 --> 00:03:56,853
I'm not seeing
commissions on that.

71
00:03:56,928 --> 00:03:59,453
I hear you, Stanley. That
is a great observation.

72
00:03:59,531 --> 00:04:04,161
Problems like that will not happen when
we launch Dunder Mifflin Infinity 2.0.

73
00:04:04,369 --> 00:04:06,098
When will that be?
TBD.

74
00:04:06,171 --> 00:04:07,195
Phyllis.

75
00:04:07,272 --> 00:04:08,296
Did the police solve
the problem with...

76
00:04:08,373 --> 00:04:10,705
Yes, yes, they did.
Yes, they did.

77
00:04:10,775 --> 00:04:14,939
Yes, the social networking feature of
the Dunder Mifflin Infinity website

78
00:04:15,013 --> 00:04:17,538
was infiltrated by
sexual predators.

79
00:04:17,615 --> 00:04:20,550
I don't understand why our website needs
to have social networking at all.

80
00:04:20,618 --> 00:04:22,518
Yeah, actually I have to
agree with Dwight on that one.

81
00:04:22,587 --> 00:04:26,079
It's all about creating a
one-stop consumer experience.

82
00:04:26,191 --> 00:04:28,091
All right? You're chatting
with your friends,

83
00:04:28,159 --> 00:04:29,956
you're talking about
the latest music.

84
00:04:30,028 --> 00:04:31,086
About the election.

85
00:04:31,162 --> 00:04:35,360
All of it is happening
in our virtual paper store.

86
00:04:35,433 --> 00:04:37,993
And then an older gentleman
asks you, "Boxers or briefs?"

87
00:04:38,069 --> 00:04:40,469
I don't get the big fuss,
here. I like the site.

88
00:04:40,538 --> 00:04:43,939
If I had created a website with this
many problems, I'd kill myself.

89
00:04:44,008 --> 00:04:45,100
Do you have a
question, Kelly?

90
00:04:45,176 --> 00:04:46,268
Yeah, I have a
lot of questions.

91
00:04:46,344 --> 00:04:48,039
Number one.
How dare you?

92
00:04:51,516 --> 00:04:57,148
Ryan has done a very good job, and
I am not applauding sarcastically.

93
00:04:57,222 --> 00:04:58,917
Think about it.
A month ago,

94
00:04:58,990 --> 00:05:01,185
nobody would go on this site,
because we were worried

95
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:05,662
about getting molested or losing
our identity, having it stolen.

96
00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:12,294
But now, at a time TDB, all of these
problems will be in the past.

97
00:05:12,370 --> 00:05:14,838
You done good, kid.
You done good.

98
00:05:19,544 --> 00:05:21,739
Well, it has been nice
seeing you again, my friend.

99
00:05:21,813 --> 00:05:22,837
You, too.

100
00:05:24,782 --> 00:05:27,148
Oh, Ryan, I need a
girlfriend so bad.

101
00:05:27,218 --> 00:05:28,742
Michael, let me go.

102
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:29,980
Let me go, Michael.

103
00:05:30,054 --> 00:05:31,146
All right.

104
00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:34,891
Do you know any girls in New York
you might want to hook me up with,

105
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:37,860
that might be interested
in a guy like me?

106
00:05:38,396 --> 00:05:39,658
Nah.
Nah.

107
00:05:39,731 --> 00:05:41,323
Sorry, man.
Well, you tried.

108
00:05:41,399 --> 00:05:42,866
But, seriously...

109
00:05:42,934 --> 00:05:45,630
You should see the girls
I meet at clubs in the city.

110
00:05:45,703 --> 00:05:46,795
Unreal.

111
00:05:46,871 --> 00:05:48,236
They sound great.

112
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:52,836
Bye, everyone! Stay real,
Scranton, all right? Peace!

113
00:05:55,513 --> 00:05:56,878
Would you have sex
with Meredith?

114
00:05:56,948 --> 00:05:57,972
What?

115
00:05:58,049 --> 00:05:59,209
Do you think
she'd keep it quiet?

116
00:05:59,284 --> 00:06:00,808
I'm gonna go to my desk.

117
00:06:00,885 --> 00:06:04,719
Jim, it's not the horniness, okay?
It's the loneliness. That's...

118
00:06:05,089 --> 00:06:06,113
I know.

119
00:06:06,457 --> 00:06:08,652
Let's go to New York.
We'll go clubbing with Ryan.

120
00:06:08,726 --> 00:06:10,023
I can't.
Yes, you can.

121
00:06:10,094 --> 00:06:11,857
You're single, I'm single.
It'll be awesome.

122
00:06:11,929 --> 00:06:12,987
I'm not single.

123
00:06:13,064 --> 00:06:14,531
Who are you dating?

124
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:16,190
Pam.

125
00:06:16,267 --> 00:06:17,825
That's still going on?

126
00:06:20,872 --> 00:06:22,965
Okay, Dwight, grab your stuff.

127
00:06:23,041 --> 00:06:25,601
We're going to New York to party
with Ryan and to meet girls.

128
00:06:25,677 --> 00:06:26,803
- Yeah!
- Oh, yes.

129
00:06:26,878 --> 00:06:31,042
Count me in, dudes. I am in
serious need of some bro time.

130
00:06:32,016 --> 00:06:35,144
Old ball and chain's been a lot
more chain than ball lately,

131
00:06:35,219 --> 00:06:36,914
if you know what I'm saying.
I'm right here.

132
00:06:36,988 --> 00:06:40,480
No, singles only. Singles only.
Also, three is unlucky.

133
00:06:41,793 --> 00:06:43,158
Curse of three.
Sorry, Andy.

134
00:06:43,227 --> 00:06:45,491
Cannot take any chances on curses.
Not tonight.

135
00:06:45,563 --> 00:06:48,259
Let's go. Everybody, I will see
you tomorrow, Saturday morning,

136
00:06:48,333 --> 00:06:51,632
probably wearing the same clothes
that I'm wearing right now,

137
00:06:51,936 --> 00:06:53,927
if you catch my drift.

138
00:06:54,072 --> 00:06:55,130
We get it.

139
00:06:55,206 --> 00:06:56,696
I am going

140
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:58,433
to go get laid.

141
00:06:58,509 --> 00:06:59,533
Goodbye!

142
00:06:59,610 --> 00:07:01,134
With sex!

143
00:07:04,549 --> 00:07:06,540
You know what? If we all stayed
a couple hours late tonight

144
00:07:06,617 --> 00:07:09,814
without Michael distracting us, we
wouldn't have to come in at all tomorrow.

145
00:07:11,656 --> 00:07:15,057
So I caught everyone before they
left, and I told them my idea.

146
00:07:15,326 --> 00:07:16,486
And they loved it.

147
00:07:16,561 --> 00:07:19,325
Because this is a group
that respects good ideas.

148
00:07:20,231 --> 00:07:22,131
The one time a year
they hear one.

149
00:07:25,403 --> 00:07:27,394
Ryan's assistant told us

150
00:07:27,472 --> 00:07:30,441
that he would be
at this club this evening.

151
00:07:30,508 --> 00:07:32,135
It is called Prerogative.

152
00:07:36,914 --> 00:07:38,381
This place is packed!

153
00:07:38,449 --> 00:07:39,939
F'ire hazard.

154
00:07:40,284 --> 00:07:41,376
Packed with

155
00:07:41,652 --> 00:07:43,119
"beautiful babies."

156
00:07:43,921 --> 00:07:45,752
Swingers, classic.

157
00:07:46,557 --> 00:07:49,890
Jon F'avreau,
tall guy from Dodgeball.

158
00:07:50,762 --> 00:07:52,195
These women look
like white slaves.

159
00:07:52,263 --> 00:07:54,493
No, they're just hot.
Hotties.

160
00:07:54,565 --> 00:07:57,762
I don't know. When you think about
it, Cabo is really the Third World.

161
00:07:57,835 --> 00:08:00,395
I don't go to a place like that
to see more poverty, you know?

162
00:08:00,471 --> 00:08:01,495
You go there to get
some glamour, and...

163
00:08:01,572 --> 00:08:02,561
Hey.

164
00:08:02,673 --> 00:08:03,662
Michael?

165
00:08:03,741 --> 00:08:04,765
Hey.

166
00:08:04,842 --> 00:08:05,866
What are you doing here?

167
00:08:05,943 --> 00:08:06,967
Well, you know,

168
00:08:07,044 --> 00:08:08,909
just taking you up
on your offer to party, so...

169
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:09,969
Ta-da!

170
00:08:10,314 --> 00:08:11,713
That is so awesome, man!

171
00:08:11,783 --> 00:08:12,977
All right!

172
00:08:13,518 --> 00:08:14,542
And you brought this guy!

173
00:08:14,619 --> 00:08:15,847
Yeah!

174
00:08:15,953 --> 00:08:17,181
Oh!

175
00:08:19,123 --> 00:08:20,613
Ryan, it's Michael
and Dwight.

176
00:08:20,691 --> 00:08:22,090
I know it's you guys!
Okay.

177
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,128
I'm so psyched you're here.
Well...

178
00:08:25,296 --> 00:08:26,422
All right!

179
00:08:26,964 --> 00:08:28,090
Let's get a drink!

180
00:08:28,166 --> 00:08:29,190
Let's do it!

181
00:08:35,591 --> 00:08:37,684
Thanks a lot, guys!
Good job!

182
00:08:40,696 --> 00:08:41,720
Later.

183
00:08:41,830 --> 00:08:43,297
Nice job, everybody.

184
00:08:43,365 --> 00:08:44,491
Great work.

185
00:08:50,839 --> 00:08:53,967
Did you not tell the security
guard we were working late?

186
00:08:54,410 --> 00:08:56,640
Nope. I didn't.

187
00:08:57,513 --> 00:09:00,277
But let's go inside and I
can call him right now.

188
00:09:00,349 --> 00:09:03,284
We can't. I locked the office
from the inside when we left.

189
00:09:03,352 --> 00:09:05,912
Perfect. You guys worked
together on this one.

190
00:09:06,422 --> 00:09:10,483
If I'm not in my bath with a glass of
red wine in one hour, you're both dead.

191
00:09:14,964 --> 00:09:18,127
There is a master key and a
spare key for the office.

192
00:09:18,901 --> 00:09:20,425
Dwight has them both.

193
00:09:21,003 --> 00:09:24,700
When I asked, "What if you die, Dwight?
How will we get into the office?"

194
00:09:24,773 --> 00:09:28,174
He said, "If I'm dead, you guys
have been dead for weeks."

195
00:09:28,911 --> 00:09:32,176
Guys, I want you to meet a really
good friend of mine. This is Troy.

196
00:09:32,248 --> 00:09:33,306
Hey,
nice to meet you.

197
00:09:33,382 --> 00:09:34,406
How're you doing?

198
00:09:34,483 --> 00:09:35,780
Hi. Dwight.

199
00:09:36,385 --> 00:09:38,319
You resemble the
Tolkien character.

200
00:09:38,387 --> 00:09:41,356
He basically is, man. He's
a regular banking wizard.

201
00:09:41,423 --> 00:09:43,550
No, no, no, not a wizard.
A hobbit.

202
00:09:44,827 --> 00:09:45,885
Bottle service, y'all?

203
00:09:45,961 --> 00:09:48,395
Oh, okay.
All I know is,

204
00:09:48,464 --> 00:09:51,627
I would like some chicken
fingers and a Midori Sour.

205
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:53,429
We don't serve food here.

206
00:09:53,569 --> 00:09:56,595
Oh, okay. Then just
bring me two cups,

207
00:09:56,672 --> 00:10:00,733
one with olives, and another one
filled with maraschino cherries.

208
00:10:02,578 --> 00:10:04,773
Do you live in a
regular-sized house?

209
00:10:05,614 --> 00:10:07,241
Yeah, he's a normal guy.
He's cool.

210
00:10:07,983 --> 00:10:09,450
You really don't have
his phone number?

211
00:10:09,518 --> 00:10:11,782
I told you, I have the
number that rings here.

212
00:10:11,854 --> 00:10:12,980
Do you want that number?

213
00:10:13,055 --> 00:10:14,750
I might have it in here.

214
00:10:15,024 --> 00:10:16,719
Wow, that's great, Toby.

215
00:10:16,859 --> 00:10:18,656
It's so random
that I have it.

216
00:10:18,727 --> 00:10:20,217
Toby, you're the best!

217
00:10:20,296 --> 00:10:23,595
When I put it in, I thought it might be a
waste of time, but I guess it was worth it.

218
00:10:23,666 --> 00:10:26,066
Great. It's under here as
"security guard home."

219
00:10:26,135 --> 00:10:28,035
Did you not get his name, or...
No.

220
00:10:28,103 --> 00:10:30,503
It's ringing... Does anybody
have his name, quick?

221
00:10:30,572 --> 00:10:31,630
Yes, it's Eddie.

222
00:10:31,707 --> 00:10:33,641
It's not... It's not Eddie.
It's Evan or...

223
00:10:33,709 --> 00:10:35,108
Hank.
His name is Hank.

224
00:10:35,177 --> 00:10:37,839
No, guys, his name's not Hank, it's...
Is it Edgar?

225
00:10:37,913 --> 00:10:38,937
Elliot.
Elliot.

226
00:10:39,014 --> 00:10:40,948
Is it... Hey, chief.

227
00:10:41,617 --> 00:10:43,778
This is Jim Halpert from

228
00:10:43,919 --> 00:10:45,216
where you work.

229
00:10:45,587 --> 00:10:49,751
You are the guy who sits behind the desk.
You're the...

230
00:10:50,426 --> 00:10:52,326
The African-American guy.

231
00:10:52,394 --> 00:10:53,884
I mean, you're...

232
00:10:54,697 --> 00:10:55,857
Who have I got here?

233
00:10:55,931 --> 00:10:59,389
Dwight Schrute, man.
How's Schrute F'arms?

234
00:10:59,468 --> 00:11:00,730
Good.

235
00:11:00,803 --> 00:11:02,634
This guy owns
his own beet farm.

236
00:11:02,705 --> 00:11:03,729
Insane!

237
00:11:03,806 --> 00:11:05,865
Well, it's weevil season,
but we were prepared.

238
00:11:05,941 --> 00:11:08,603
"Weevils."
What a crazy word, man.

239
00:11:08,811 --> 00:11:11,245
I don't even know what that means.
What does that mean?

240
00:11:11,313 --> 00:11:13,679
They lay their eggs inside
the unripe beetroot,

241
00:11:13,749 --> 00:11:15,842
then, come springtime,
the babies eat their way out.

242
00:11:15,918 --> 00:11:17,249
Crazy!
Sick!

243
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:20,780
That's too much for me, man.
I'm gonna hit the bathroom.

244
00:11:20,856 --> 00:11:22,847
You've already been
several times.

245
00:11:22,925 --> 00:11:23,949
Yeah?

246
00:11:24,026 --> 00:11:25,618
Maybe you have some
kind of bladder infection.

247
00:11:25,694 --> 00:11:26,752
I don't know. Maybe.

248
00:11:26,829 --> 00:11:28,490
I'll order you some
cranberry juice.

249
00:11:28,564 --> 00:11:30,361
With vodka.
You're the best!

250
00:11:32,267 --> 00:11:33,529
Do you have powers?

251
00:11:34,136 --> 00:11:35,364
Oh, thank you, Hank.

252
00:11:35,437 --> 00:11:38,099
You are a lifesaver,
Hank. Appreciate it.

253
00:11:38,173 --> 00:11:41,802
All right, so Hank is going to come
down here. He's gonna let us all out.

254
00:11:41,877 --> 00:11:44,175
He said it should be
just under an hour, so...

255
00:11:44,246 --> 00:11:45,508
Oh!

256
00:11:45,581 --> 00:11:46,605
We did it.

257
00:11:46,682 --> 00:11:49,515
We should all make sure to give
him a big tip this Christmas.

258
00:11:49,585 --> 00:11:52,748
Sorry, guys, but I don't think
I chipped in for last year's.

259
00:11:52,821 --> 00:11:54,083
Neither did I.

260
00:11:54,456 --> 00:11:56,515
Jim was supposed
to collect it.

261
00:11:58,927 --> 00:12:00,451
Way to go, man.

262
00:12:00,529 --> 00:12:01,860
Now he's never
gonna come.

263
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:05,696
By a show of hands, who thinks we're
a better couple than Jim and Pam?

264
00:12:08,837 --> 00:12:09,895
Phyllis!

265
00:12:11,907 --> 00:12:15,866
I thought about getting a tattoo
on my back, as well, at one point.

266
00:12:16,378 --> 00:12:19,006
I was thinking about getting
Back to the Future.

267
00:12:19,081 --> 00:12:21,072
"Back" because
it's on my back,

268
00:12:21,617 --> 00:12:25,815
and "F'uture" because I'm the kind of guy
who likes to look ahead into the future.

269
00:12:26,288 --> 00:12:29,451
I just think a tattoo should
mean something, you know?

270
00:12:29,658 --> 00:12:31,125
And it's my
second-favorite movie.

271
00:12:31,193 --> 00:12:32,626
I've never heard
of that movie.

272
00:12:32,694 --> 00:12:35,788
Back to the Future?
Oh, wow!

273
00:12:36,265 --> 00:12:38,893
Well, you should take
a film education course.

274
00:12:39,034 --> 00:12:40,228
How old are you?

275
00:12:40,302 --> 00:12:42,133
40... I'm in my 40s.

276
00:12:42,604 --> 00:12:45,334
Wow, that's so cool.

277
00:12:45,407 --> 00:12:46,396
Yeah.

278
00:12:47,075 --> 00:12:48,838
Well, I'm gonna go
back to my group now.

279
00:12:48,911 --> 00:12:50,105
Oh, okay.

280
00:12:50,312 --> 00:12:51,370
Thanks for the drink.

281
00:12:51,447 --> 00:12:52,812
You are welcome.

282
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:00,384
This place is like a...
Like a sexy preschool.

283
00:13:00,456 --> 00:13:02,356
Did you want a place where
we can meet older women?

284
00:13:02,424 --> 00:13:04,824
I would love a place where
we can meet older girls.

285
00:13:04,893 --> 00:13:06,019
Hell, yeah!

286
00:13:06,829 --> 00:13:08,194
I'll hook it up!

287
00:13:09,198 --> 00:13:10,426
Wow, that's dangerous.

288
00:13:19,074 --> 00:13:20,132
Excuse me.

289
00:13:20,209 --> 00:13:21,301
Yeah?

290
00:13:21,844 --> 00:13:23,835
How did you all
find each other?

291
00:13:24,313 --> 00:13:27,976
We're the Jersey State varsity basketball
team. Northeast Regional Champs.

292
00:13:30,652 --> 00:13:31,846
Amazons!

293
00:13:33,489 --> 00:13:35,047
It's off. It's not
the dude I know.

294
00:13:35,123 --> 00:13:37,216
It's some other loser who won't
let us in without chicks.

295
00:13:37,292 --> 00:13:38,782
- You're kidding.
- Let's bail.

296
00:13:38,861 --> 00:13:42,194
Wait, wait, wait. You two,
Jersey State girls, let's go.

297
00:13:42,264 --> 00:13:44,129
We're not going
unless we can all go.

298
00:13:44,199 --> 00:13:45,666
Okay, you know what? F'ine.

299
00:13:45,734 --> 00:13:48,066
Let's go, two girls to a guy.
Come on, let's do it.

300
00:13:48,136 --> 00:13:49,728
Come on, Ryan. Move out!

301
00:13:49,805 --> 00:13:53,036
Hey, three or four with him.
Let's go, come on. Here we go.

302
00:13:53,308 --> 00:13:54,605
Don't step on him.

303
00:13:56,478 --> 00:13:57,467
Really?

304
00:13:57,546 --> 00:13:59,377
Hey, look what I
found in the back.

305
00:13:59,448 --> 00:14:00,813
Want to play?
I can teach you to throw.

306
00:14:00,883 --> 00:14:02,043
I know how to
throw a football.

307
00:14:02,117 --> 00:14:03,243
Of course you do.

308
00:14:03,318 --> 00:14:05,081
Yeah, Pam! Hit me up!

309
00:14:05,153 --> 00:14:06,279
Go long!

310
00:14:13,161 --> 00:14:14,389
There you go.

311
00:14:14,463 --> 00:14:16,363
Wait a minute. What is this?
I didn't order this.

312
00:14:16,431 --> 00:14:18,626
It's for you. F'rom them.

313
00:14:23,805 --> 00:14:24,999
What are you doing, man?

314
00:14:25,073 --> 00:14:27,803
It's not safe. Anything
could have been in there.

315
00:14:28,010 --> 00:14:29,272
Nice try!

316
00:14:29,545 --> 00:14:31,445
I've never met anybody
who does that.

317
00:14:31,513 --> 00:14:33,606
You wash dogs. Very cool.

318
00:14:33,682 --> 00:14:36,207
That's one aspect of small pet grooming.
What do you do?

319
00:14:36,285 --> 00:14:37,616
I am a bank teller.

320
00:14:38,186 --> 00:14:41,314
Ryan told me to always tell
women you work in finance.

321
00:14:41,390 --> 00:14:42,618
Cool. Yeah.

322
00:14:42,691 --> 00:14:44,215
I think so.
Yeah, I have fun.

323
00:14:44,293 --> 00:14:46,193
I'm just gonna use
the powder room.

324
00:14:46,261 --> 00:14:47,888
All right. So,
I'll see you soon.

325
00:14:47,963 --> 00:14:49,191
Very perfect.

326
00:14:57,072 --> 00:14:59,939
This needs to be shared.

327
00:15:20,095 --> 00:15:21,824
She washes dogs.

328
00:15:21,897 --> 00:15:23,262
You're doing it, man
I know!

329
00:15:23,332 --> 00:15:25,823
I don't want to get ahead
of myself, but...

330
00:15:26,468 --> 00:15:27,457
I think I want her
to meet my mom.

331
00:15:27,536 --> 00:15:29,026
Hey, man,

332
00:15:29,137 --> 00:15:32,197
do you ever think there's gonna be
this massive nuclear holocaust?

333
00:15:32,274 --> 00:15:34,003
And after all the major
nations are destroyed,

334
00:15:34,076 --> 00:15:36,943
there'll just be tribes in the
jungles that rise up and survive?

335
00:15:37,012 --> 00:15:39,537
That jungle warfare
is gonna rule the world?

336
00:15:40,482 --> 00:15:41,642
Yeah, maybe.

337
00:15:50,626 --> 00:15:51,650
It's inevitable, right?

338
00:15:51,727 --> 00:15:52,716
Mmm-hmm.

339
00:15:54,162 --> 00:15:55,595
Please don't pick up.
Please don't pick up.

340
00:15:55,664 --> 00:15:56,688
Hello.

341
00:15:56,765 --> 00:15:57,789
Hank.

342
00:15:57,866 --> 00:15:59,231
Is that you?
Yeah.

343
00:16:00,235 --> 00:16:01,429
Still haven't left the
house yet, huh?

344
00:16:01,503 --> 00:16:03,061
I was getting
ready to leave.

345
00:16:03,138 --> 00:16:05,129
Good. Please hurry.

346
00:16:05,273 --> 00:16:08,003
Stop calling me,
so I can put on my damn socks.

347
00:16:08,276 --> 00:16:10,767
Will do. I'll stop calling.

348
00:16:13,615 --> 00:16:14,877
I am.

349
00:16:15,017 --> 00:16:16,644
I am getting out there.

350
00:16:17,152 --> 00:16:19,848
Well, no, I've asked
a lot of girls to dance, Mom.

351
00:16:19,921 --> 00:16:21,718
They're just... It's not...

352
00:16:22,591 --> 00:16:23,649
Listen to me for a second.

353
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:27,328
Yes, I shaved
the back of my neck.

354
00:16:27,396 --> 00:16:29,421
Oh, my God.
Mom, I gotta go.

355
00:16:29,498 --> 00:16:31,523
One of my friends is getting
beaten up by some girls!

356
00:16:33,702 --> 00:16:37,399
Actually, it's kind of too bad we're
not coming into work tomorrow.

357
00:16:37,472 --> 00:16:38,632
Why?

358
00:16:38,707 --> 00:16:39,901
I bet Michael had
some elaborate

359
00:16:39,975 --> 00:16:43,138
theme party planned,
like "Scrambled Egg Saturday."

360
00:16:44,146 --> 00:16:47,513
More like, "Hey, everyone, let's
get your boss laid" Saturday.

361
00:16:57,826 --> 00:17:01,557
I have an announcement
to make.

362
00:17:01,930 --> 00:17:05,866
I am moving to Costa Rica.

363
00:17:05,967 --> 00:17:09,198
I've thought about it
for a long time, now,

364
00:17:09,705 --> 00:17:11,502
and I'm finally gonna do it.

365
00:17:13,075 --> 00:17:14,201
So...

366
00:17:14,976 --> 00:17:17,536
I'm just gonna hop the
fence and jog home, then.

367
00:17:32,695 --> 00:17:33,821
Those girls really
whaled on you bad.

368
00:17:33,896 --> 00:17:35,557
Why wouldn't they
let me dance?

369
00:17:35,631 --> 00:17:36,996
Okay, I gotta go.

370
00:17:37,166 --> 00:17:39,066
Do not take him
to a hospital.

371
00:17:41,571 --> 00:17:42,731
Pretty weird.

372
00:17:42,805 --> 00:17:44,272
Do you have to go
with them?

373
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:45,671
I do, I have to go.

374
00:17:45,742 --> 00:17:46,902
Stay. Just stay, please.

375
00:17:46,976 --> 00:17:48,102
Okay, no. I have to go.

376
00:17:48,177 --> 00:17:49,542
Good luck against
Conn College, all right?

377
00:17:49,612 --> 00:17:50,738
Call me.

378
00:17:50,813 --> 00:17:51,837
Uh-huh.

379
00:17:51,914 --> 00:17:53,108
I'm not gonna call her.

380
00:17:53,182 --> 00:17:54,171
I don't want to go back in.

381
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:55,342
I know. Here we go.

382
00:18:00,223 --> 00:18:02,088
Cleaning people. Oscar?

383
00:18:05,194 --> 00:18:07,253
Okay, so all you need to do is
explain to them what happened,

384
00:18:07,330 --> 00:18:08,422
'cause I think they
can help us.

385
00:18:08,498 --> 00:18:11,058
Why are you assuming
they only speak Spanish?

386
00:18:11,834 --> 00:18:13,426
If they speak Spanish.

387
00:18:13,836 --> 00:18:15,098
Good evening.

388
00:18:15,171 --> 00:18:16,798
We locked ourselves in.

389
00:18:23,045 --> 00:18:24,535
They happen to
speak Spanish.

390
00:18:24,614 --> 00:18:25,945
Lucky us.

391
00:18:30,319 --> 00:18:32,787
This is a one-time thing.
You know that, right?

392
00:18:32,855 --> 00:18:34,516
Wow. All right!

393
00:18:34,590 --> 00:18:36,023
This is it.

394
00:18:36,092 --> 00:18:37,821
This is where
the magic happens.

395
00:18:37,894 --> 00:18:39,691
Nice!
Very nice.

396
00:18:39,762 --> 00:18:42,424
One of you can have the sofa, and
one of you can have the floor.

397
00:18:42,498 --> 00:18:43,931
- I got the sofa.
- I got sofa.

398
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,126
Dwight, I got the sofa,
I'm the boss.

399
00:18:45,201 --> 00:18:46,566
Come on. I got floor!

400
00:18:46,636 --> 00:18:48,228
In case anybody needs
to go to the bathroom

401
00:18:48,304 --> 00:18:50,465
in the middle of the night, I don't
want to get my head stepped on.

402
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:52,906
Do you want me to sing you a
song my mother used to sing me

403
00:18:52,975 --> 00:18:54,465
when we were sick?
No.

404
00:18:55,645 --> 00:18:58,307
Okay, Dwight. Dwight.

405
00:18:59,816 --> 00:19:01,807
Leave him alone.
It's a lullaby.

406
00:19:02,518 --> 00:19:05,146
Ryan? Ryan, we're gonna
take your clothes off.

407
00:19:05,321 --> 00:19:06,345
No!

408
00:19:09,025 --> 00:19:10,049
Guys...

409
00:19:11,527 --> 00:19:14,325
I think my friend Troy
might have a drug problem.

410
00:19:15,131 --> 00:19:16,359
What do I do?

411
00:19:16,966 --> 00:19:19,901
I think his species might have
a higher tolerance than ours.

412
00:19:19,969 --> 00:19:21,937
Just stop.

413
00:19:22,471 --> 00:19:23,938
Here's what you do.

414
00:19:24,874 --> 00:19:28,970
You tell him that you're his friend
and that you're going to help him,

415
00:19:29,045 --> 00:19:31,445
and that everything's
gonna be all right.

416
00:19:33,416 --> 00:19:35,350
And then you put
a wire on him,

417
00:19:35,818 --> 00:19:38,286
and you find out
who's selling him drugs.

418
00:19:39,155 --> 00:19:42,022
And then you get that
guy and you flip him.

419
00:19:42,091 --> 00:19:44,787
You turn him into a snitch.
You follow that guy

420
00:19:45,094 --> 00:19:47,654
to the people who're
really, really bad.

421
00:19:48,064 --> 00:19:51,830
I've been watching The Wire recently.
I don't understand a word of it.

422
00:19:52,068 --> 00:19:53,365
Guys, I'm going
to sleep.

423
00:19:53,436 --> 00:19:56,530
You can leave the light on if you
want, but please stop talking, okay?

424
00:19:56,606 --> 00:19:58,198
Okay. Good night, Ryan.

425
00:19:58,641 --> 00:19:59,972
Good night, Ryan.

426
00:20:03,079 --> 00:20:04,740
Best night ever.

427
00:20:05,514 --> 00:20:06,572
Like I said,

428
00:20:06,649 --> 00:20:09,777
it's not about the horniness.
It's about the loneliness.

429
00:20:10,052 --> 00:20:12,452
And how can I be
lonely with my boys?

430
00:20:13,789 --> 00:20:15,723
Like a famous
person once said,

431
00:20:16,359 --> 00:20:17,724
Boys on the Side.

432
00:20:18,194 --> 00:20:19,752
But I don't... I disagree.

433
00:20:19,829 --> 00:20:23,424
I say, Let's Hear
It for the Boys.

434
00:20:38,814 --> 00:20:40,509
Son of a bitch.
