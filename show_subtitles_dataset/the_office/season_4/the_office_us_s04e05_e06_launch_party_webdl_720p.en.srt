1
00:00:00,275 --> 00:00:03,733
And the same thing goes for quarterly
reports. They are unreadable.

2
00:00:03,811 --> 00:00:05,278
They're just numbers
and boring and...

3
00:00:05,346 --> 00:00:06,370
Blech!

4
00:00:06,447 --> 00:00:09,541
So what I was thinking is that maybe
we should have some sort of graphic,

5
00:00:09,617 --> 00:00:12,711
like if we have a bad quarter,
put in a storm cloud.

6
00:00:15,023 --> 00:00:18,618
And when we have
a good quarter,

7
00:00:18,693 --> 00:00:22,561
fireworks or a racecar.

8
00:00:23,464 --> 00:00:26,558
Doesn't have to be a racecar.
Use your imagination.

9
00:00:26,634 --> 00:00:29,364
There's this cube on the screen,
and it bounces around all day,

10
00:00:29,437 --> 00:00:33,271
and sometimes it looks like it's heading
right into the corner of the screen,

11
00:00:33,341 --> 00:00:36,435
and then at the last minute, it
hits a wall and bounces away.

12
00:00:36,511 --> 00:00:39,878
We are all just dying to see
it go right into the corner.

13
00:00:42,083 --> 00:00:45,951
Pam claims that she saw it one day when
she was alone in the conference room.

14
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:48,921
Okay. I believe she
thinks she saw it.

15
00:00:49,524 --> 00:00:52,254
I saw it. I saw it,
and it was amazing.

16
00:00:52,327 --> 00:00:54,488
Who said I didn't see it? Did
Jim say that I didn't see it?

17
00:00:54,562 --> 00:00:55,620
I saw it.

18
00:00:55,863 --> 00:00:58,627
We have a lot
of colored paper here.

19
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:01,066
Why, oh, why do we keep
printing this on white?

20
00:01:01,135 --> 00:01:02,898
No! Come on!

21
00:01:02,971 --> 00:01:05,269
Yeah! I know.

22
00:01:06,007 --> 00:01:07,269
I know.
It's bland.

23
00:01:07,342 --> 00:01:08,502
It's never going
to happen.

24
00:01:08,576 --> 00:01:10,407
Dude, you gotta believe.

25
00:01:10,578 --> 00:01:13,103
Maybe we could have
some sort of riddle?

26
00:01:13,181 --> 00:01:14,205
Wait for it.

27
00:01:14,282 --> 00:01:20,118
Like something that you have to
look for, sort of a Where's Waldo?

28
00:01:24,692 --> 00:01:26,819
All right. All right.
Let's quit while we're ahead.

29
00:01:26,894 --> 00:01:28,191
That was so awesome.

30
00:01:28,263 --> 00:01:30,595
That was awesome.
Thank you.

31
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:36,161
Some days I am just on fire.
What can I say?

32
00:02:10,038 --> 00:02:11,562
Hey. There he is.

33
00:02:11,639 --> 00:02:13,334
Hey, Meredith.
How are you feeling?

34
00:02:13,408 --> 00:02:15,137
I never thanked you
for coming to the hospital.

35
00:02:15,209 --> 00:02:17,700
Oh, please. It was my pleasure.
Well, we all came, so...

36
00:02:17,779 --> 00:02:20,009
Well, I really appreciate
you coming.

37
00:02:20,081 --> 00:02:22,015
I'm singling you out.

38
00:02:23,184 --> 00:02:25,311
Anyway, I have
this Sharpie,

39
00:02:25,386 --> 00:02:28,082
and I was wondering
if you could sign my cast.

40
00:02:28,189 --> 00:02:29,622
Mmm-hmm.

41
00:02:34,796 --> 00:02:35,956
Can you write
where I can read it?

42
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:37,429
Oh, yeah.

43
00:02:43,271 --> 00:02:45,501
I'll read this
when I get home.

44
00:02:45,573 --> 00:02:46,938
All right.

45
00:02:50,278 --> 00:02:52,576
Michael, this is the press
release I was telling you about.

46
00:02:52,647 --> 00:02:54,376
Ryan wants you to
share it with everyone.

47
00:02:54,449 --> 00:02:55,711
Does he?

48
00:02:55,783 --> 00:02:57,045
He does.

49
00:02:57,919 --> 00:03:00,012
Okay. Attention.

50
00:03:00,088 --> 00:03:02,079
Earthlings,
I have some news.

51
00:03:02,156 --> 00:03:05,250
Beep, beep, beep.

52
00:03:05,326 --> 00:03:06,884
Beep, beep, beep. Okay.

53
00:03:06,961 --> 00:03:10,863
Today is the big day that I'm heading
to New York to attend a party

54
00:03:10,932 --> 00:03:12,957
with sushi and
important people.

55
00:03:13,201 --> 00:03:16,068
On an unrelated note, if anybody
has an interesting anecdote

56
00:03:16,137 --> 00:03:18,037
that is not boring
and easy to memorize,

57
00:03:18,106 --> 00:03:20,973
please drop by my office before I leave.
Thank you.

58
00:03:21,676 --> 00:03:24,008
Is that really what Ryan
wanted you to tell us?

59
00:03:24,078 --> 00:03:29,641
And today, the Dunder Mifflin
Infinity website officially launches.

60
00:03:30,017 --> 00:03:33,578
Well, the website is the
brainchild of my brainchild, Ryan.

61
00:03:33,654 --> 00:03:35,713
It is my brain-grandchild.

62
00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:37,985
And to celebrate its birth,

63
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:41,185
all of the different branches are
going to have satellite parties,

64
00:03:41,262 --> 00:03:45,028
which will be connected,
via webcams and fibers,

65
00:03:45,099 --> 00:03:47,795
to the real party, which is
going on in New York City

66
00:03:47,869 --> 00:03:50,861
at a very
exclusive nightclub.

67
00:03:50,938 --> 00:03:54,465
That is where
all of the VIPs,

68
00:03:54,542 --> 00:03:59,878
including yours truly, will be
partying with New York City's finest.

69
00:03:59,947 --> 00:04:01,938
And I do not
mean policemen.

70
00:04:02,283 --> 00:04:04,513
The company is projecting
record high sales,

71
00:04:04,585 --> 00:04:08,646
and that by 6:00, the website will be
the new best salesman in the company.

72
00:04:08,723 --> 00:04:09,951
Wow. Watch out, Dwight.

73
00:04:10,024 --> 00:04:12,754
That's ridiculous. I'm not
gonna be beaten by a website.

74
00:04:12,827 --> 00:04:14,021
Actually it sounds
like you are.

75
00:04:14,095 --> 00:04:16,029
Really?
'Cause Ryan says so?

76
00:04:16,097 --> 00:04:18,691
That's from Ryan? Does it
mention if he's seeing anybody?

77
00:04:18,766 --> 00:04:20,233
No, it doesn't.
I'll find out tonight.

78
00:04:20,301 --> 00:04:21,825
Yes, please let us know.

79
00:04:21,903 --> 00:04:23,996
I can make more
sales than a computer.

80
00:04:24,071 --> 00:04:27,438
In fact, I challenge that website
to make more sales than me today.

81
00:04:27,508 --> 00:04:28,941
Waste of time.

82
00:04:29,010 --> 00:04:30,341
What's that, pipsqueak?

83
00:04:30,411 --> 00:04:33,107
Waste of time. The
website's going to win.

84
00:04:33,181 --> 00:04:34,842
You believe a computer
can beat me?

85
00:04:34,916 --> 00:04:36,076
I don't care,
but yes.

86
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:37,515
Well, I will
prove you wrong.

87
00:04:37,585 --> 00:04:39,416
I don't care, and you won't.
You'll see.

88
00:04:39,487 --> 00:04:41,284
I won't be watching,
and I won't.

89
00:04:43,491 --> 00:04:45,584
Dwight mercy-killed
Angela's cat.

90
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:47,552
It's very complicated.

91
00:04:48,763 --> 00:04:52,221
It's caused a lot of unpleasantness
between Dwight and Angela,

92
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:54,393
who were both already
prone to unpleasantness.

93
00:05:01,876 --> 00:05:03,605
Stanley,
you're dancing.

94
00:05:03,678 --> 00:05:05,145
No, I'm not.

95
00:05:07,181 --> 00:05:09,979
Yeah, I created a website.

96
00:05:10,051 --> 00:05:14,044
Look, at the end of the day, Apple's
apple is flying at 30,000 feet.

97
00:05:14,655 --> 00:05:16,145
This is a paper company,

98
00:05:16,224 --> 00:05:19,216
and I don't want us to get lost in
the weeds or into a beauty contest.

99
00:05:19,293 --> 00:05:21,625
I told you I don't want you
doing these things in here.

100
00:05:21,696 --> 00:05:24,028
You can use your own office
or do it in the hall.

101
00:05:24,599 --> 00:05:27,295
Convergence, viral marketing,
we're going guerilla,

102
00:05:27,368 --> 00:05:28,392
we're taking it
the streets,

103
00:05:28,469 --> 00:05:30,460
while keeping an eye on
the street, Wall Street.

104
00:05:30,538 --> 00:05:31,869
I don't want to reinvent
the wheel here.

105
00:05:31,939 --> 00:05:34,533
In other words,
it is what it is.

106
00:05:35,176 --> 00:05:37,235
Buying paper
just became fun.

107
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:42,841
And this is where
I will record your sales.

108
00:05:43,684 --> 00:05:44,981
Very nice, very nice.

109
00:05:45,052 --> 00:05:48,954
And then I will say something
positive like, "Kudos,"

110
00:05:49,023 --> 00:05:50,718
or, "Job well done."

111
00:05:50,791 --> 00:05:52,850
Or, "Zip-a-dee-doo-dah!"

112
00:05:55,363 --> 00:05:56,853
I can't tell
if he's mocking me.

113
00:05:56,931 --> 00:05:58,558
Just ignore him.

114
00:05:59,166 --> 00:06:02,294
I can't do that. It's really
hard for me to let things go.

115
00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:04,531
I was mocking.

116
00:06:04,605 --> 00:06:06,072
Thank you.

117
00:06:07,108 --> 00:06:10,544
I just feel like we need something more
to acknowledge when I make a sale.

118
00:06:10,611 --> 00:06:12,670
Yes! Like a chime
or a bell.

119
00:06:12,747 --> 00:06:14,146
Or a gong.

120
00:06:20,454 --> 00:06:25,414
Go to my car, open the trunk,
inside you will see many pelts.

121
00:06:25,493 --> 00:06:30,089
Under the smallest one is a case.
Inside that case is a bear horn.

122
00:06:30,164 --> 00:06:31,358
Bring it to me.

123
00:06:31,432 --> 00:06:32,592
Yes!

124
00:06:38,806 --> 00:06:41,934
Isn't 7:00 p.m. A little
late for a lunch party?

125
00:06:43,277 --> 00:06:46,474
Lunch party? It's supposed
to say "Launch Party."

126
00:06:47,315 --> 00:06:48,748
What is wrong with you?

127
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:53,277
Angela is worse than usual lately,
and we have a party to throw,

128
00:06:53,854 --> 00:06:57,415
so I googled, "How to deal
with difficult people."

129
00:06:57,959 --> 00:06:59,654
And I got all of this.

130
00:07:00,728 --> 00:07:03,458
So we're gonna try out
some new things today.

131
00:07:03,698 --> 00:07:07,031
So, how do you feel about the fact
that the banner says "Lunch"?

132
00:07:07,301 --> 00:07:12,238
I feel angry. Angry at you. Angry
at you for doing something stupid.

133
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:15,839
Angry at me for believing you
could do something not stupid.

134
00:07:17,578 --> 00:07:20,046
I'm so sorry to hear that.
That must be awful.

135
00:07:20,114 --> 00:07:22,912
It is awful. You've
made this day awful.

136
00:07:23,384 --> 00:07:26,410
Maybe you could just
change the U into an A.

137
00:07:27,088 --> 00:07:29,181
Then it would say
"Lanch Party," Kevin.

138
00:07:29,256 --> 00:07:31,224
Would it really be better
if it said "Lanch Party"?

139
00:07:31,292 --> 00:07:32,350
Lunch party.

140
00:07:32,426 --> 00:07:33,916
It's supposed
to say "Launch."

141
00:07:33,995 --> 00:07:35,622
Okay, wow, easy,
booster seat.

142
00:07:35,696 --> 00:07:37,755
Nobody cares about
this party anyway.

143
00:07:37,832 --> 00:07:38,856
I care.

144
00:07:38,933 --> 00:07:41,527
"Plan a party, Angela. Oh, and
the entire world will see it.

145
00:07:41,602 --> 00:07:43,763
"Oh, and here's $65
for your budget.

146
00:07:43,838 --> 00:07:46,602
"Oh, and here are four idiots who
will do nothing but weigh you down.

147
00:07:46,674 --> 00:07:48,164
"Oh, and your
cat's still dead."

148
00:07:48,843 --> 00:07:50,071
Twenty seconds
to go-time.

149
00:07:50,144 --> 00:07:51,771
Got it. Carb up.

150
00:07:52,747 --> 00:07:54,738
Really? Power Gel?

151
00:07:54,815 --> 00:07:58,080
Hey, if you want to win,
you got to fuel like a winner.

152
00:07:58,919 --> 00:08:01,080
Okay, we start.

153
00:08:01,555 --> 00:08:04,285
As soon as
I make this shot.

154
00:08:04,358 --> 00:08:05,552
Hey! Go!

155
00:08:05,626 --> 00:08:06,684
Yeah!

156
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:10,522
Hello, Susan.
Dwight Schrute.

157
00:08:10,598 --> 00:08:13,726
What would you say if I told you
we could pull a prank on Dwight,

158
00:08:13,801 --> 00:08:15,996
at the same time,
not be working?

159
00:08:17,571 --> 00:08:19,539
What? He's going
through a breakup.

160
00:08:19,607 --> 00:08:22,906
Yeah. I'm aware of that, but
he's also being super-annoying,

161
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:24,099
and I'm not
a perfect person.

162
00:08:25,246 --> 00:08:26,577
Yeah! Yeah!

163
00:08:26,647 --> 00:08:27,773
Got one!

164
00:08:27,848 --> 00:08:31,079
Three reams! In your
face, machines!

165
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:34,815
What kind of prank
are you thinking?

166
00:08:35,823 --> 00:08:38,553
What if I told you
I could offer free shipping?

167
00:08:38,626 --> 00:08:39,991
Sure, I'll hold.

168
00:08:57,945 --> 00:09:01,210
Not sure.
Just became self-aware.

169
00:09:02,183 --> 00:09:03,775
So much to figure out.

170
00:09:04,485 --> 00:09:06,953
I think I am programmed
to be your enemy.

171
00:09:07,421 --> 00:09:12,017
I think it is my job to destroy you
when it comes to selling paper.

172
00:09:34,548 --> 00:09:37,108
It appears that the
website has become alive.

173
00:09:37,418 --> 00:09:39,784
This happens to computers
and robots sometimes.

174
00:09:39,854 --> 00:09:41,378
Am I scared of a
stupid computer?

175
00:09:41,455 --> 00:09:44,322
Please, that computer
should be scared of me.

176
00:09:44,391 --> 00:09:48,487
I have been salesman of the month
for 13 out of the last 12 months.

177
00:09:48,562 --> 00:09:51,588
You heard me right.
I did so well last F'ebruary,

178
00:09:51,699 --> 00:09:54,600
that corporate gave me two
plaques in lieu of a pay raise.

179
00:10:01,008 --> 00:10:02,566
Okay.

180
00:10:03,511 --> 00:10:04,808
Yes, it's too tight.

181
00:10:04,879 --> 00:10:05,937
Way too tight.

182
00:10:06,013 --> 00:10:07,002
Really?

183
00:10:07,081 --> 00:10:08,343
This is why
I'm here?

184
00:10:08,415 --> 00:10:10,007
Why is it so tight?

185
00:10:10,084 --> 00:10:11,449
It's a European cut.

186
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:13,248
It just looks bad.

187
00:10:14,088 --> 00:10:15,112
Um...

188
00:10:15,189 --> 00:10:18,681
Hey, what's hanging?

189
00:10:18,759 --> 00:10:20,522
Setting up the webcam
for the party.

190
00:10:20,594 --> 00:10:22,186
Good, okay, cool.

191
00:10:26,534 --> 00:10:28,525
How many pounds do you
think I can lose by 7:00?

192
00:10:28,602 --> 00:10:30,695
Depends. How much have
you eaten already today?

193
00:10:30,771 --> 00:10:33,535
I had one of those big...

194
00:10:33,607 --> 00:10:35,700
Dunder Mifflin.
This is Pam.

195
00:10:36,143 --> 00:10:39,670
Just one second. We're in a meeting.
I'll see if he's available.

196
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:41,074
It's Jan.

197
00:10:42,616 --> 00:10:45,016
Why don't you want
to go tonight? What...

198
00:10:45,085 --> 00:10:46,950
All your friends are going to be there...
My friends?

199
00:10:47,021 --> 00:10:48,386
It'll be fun. Michael,
I was terminated.

200
00:10:48,789 --> 00:10:49,778
Just...

201
00:10:49,857 --> 00:10:51,085
Is it really that
important to you?

202
00:10:51,158 --> 00:10:52,182
Yeah.

203
00:10:52,259 --> 00:10:53,658
All right.
Thank you.

204
00:10:53,727 --> 00:10:55,251
Go by yourself.

205
00:10:55,329 --> 00:10:56,660
No. No.

206
00:10:56,831 --> 00:11:00,392
No. If I go by myself, everybody
will think I'm a big loser.

207
00:11:01,635 --> 00:11:03,933
Well... Do I have your
permission to invite Carole?

208
00:11:04,004 --> 00:11:05,096
What? Jeez, Michael!

209
00:11:05,172 --> 00:11:06,366
I'm sorry.

210
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:10,206
I'm sorry. It's just the first
girl that popped into my head.

211
00:11:10,277 --> 00:11:11,767
I'll find somebody
that I haven't slept with.

212
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:14,511
Nice.

213
00:11:14,582 --> 00:11:16,447
Website check, please.

214
00:11:16,517 --> 00:11:18,246
305.

215
00:11:18,319 --> 00:11:22,415
305. You, my friend,
are winning handsomely.

216
00:11:23,257 --> 00:11:25,248
It just made
another sale. 380.

217
00:11:25,326 --> 00:11:29,820
You, my friend, are in
a very close second.

218
00:11:29,897 --> 00:11:30,955
402.

219
00:11:31,031 --> 00:11:32,862
Okay, why don't you
just lay off, lady?

220
00:11:32,933 --> 00:11:35,128
What do you want me to do?
Not announce it? 412.

221
00:11:39,673 --> 00:11:42,233
So, this is the dealio.

222
00:11:42,309 --> 00:11:44,607
God has smiled upon me

223
00:11:44,678 --> 00:11:48,170
and given me two tickets to the
big party in New York, tonight.

224
00:11:48,249 --> 00:11:50,513
What are you doing
this evening?

225
00:11:54,688 --> 00:11:56,053
Look at that.

226
00:11:56,123 --> 00:11:58,751
They have their own little
language now, like twins.

227
00:11:58,826 --> 00:11:59,884
Sure, we'll go.

228
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:01,723
All right. Well, fight it
out amongst yourselves.

229
00:12:01,795 --> 00:12:03,456
I was thinking Pammy,

230
00:12:03,530 --> 00:12:05,361
but boys' night out
is also good.

231
00:12:05,432 --> 00:12:06,899
I'm sorry. What?

232
00:12:08,235 --> 00:12:09,566
One of the tickets
is for him.

233
00:12:09,637 --> 00:12:11,935
Just let me know
who the winner is.

234
00:12:14,308 --> 00:12:15,366
Not it.
Not it. No!

235
00:12:15,442 --> 00:12:16,466
I won.

236
00:12:16,543 --> 00:12:18,534
Definitely not.
If anything it was a tie.

237
00:12:18,612 --> 00:12:20,409
Tie goes
to the girlfriend.

238
00:12:21,515 --> 00:12:25,508
No, I realize you normally reorder in
November, but what I'm suggesting...

239
00:12:25,953 --> 00:12:27,614
You did what?

240
00:12:28,188 --> 00:12:31,248
No. That's exactly what you're
not supposed to do, damn it!

241
00:12:31,325 --> 00:12:32,815
Why would you reorder
from a computer

242
00:12:32,893 --> 00:12:35,760
when you could have the
personal touch of a salesman?

243
00:12:37,531 --> 00:12:38,964
How's it going?
F'ine. Good.

244
00:12:39,033 --> 00:12:40,432
Yeah?
Yeah.

245
00:12:40,834 --> 00:12:41,892
You look
a little worried.

246
00:12:41,969 --> 00:12:43,869
I do not look worried.

247
00:12:58,218 --> 00:12:59,549
"Here's a suggestion,
computer.

248
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:02,885
"I assume you read binary, so
why don't you zero, one, one,

249
00:13:02,957 --> 00:13:05,983
"one, one, one, zero, one,
one, zero, one, one?"

250
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:07,622
Okay.

251
00:13:07,695 --> 00:13:11,927
While you were typing that, I
searched every database in existence

252
00:13:11,999 --> 00:13:16,265
and learned every fact about
everything and mastered the violin.

253
00:13:19,239 --> 00:13:21,366
And sold more paper.

254
00:13:31,685 --> 00:13:34,882
I asked for assorted cutlery,
and I got back spoons.

255
00:13:34,955 --> 00:13:36,547
These are worthless.

256
00:13:36,623 --> 00:13:38,420
I want to understand
what you're saying,

257
00:13:38,492 --> 00:13:41,393
but it's difficult for me
when you use that tone.

258
00:13:44,064 --> 00:13:47,795
Phyllis, these are spoons.

259
00:13:47,868 --> 00:13:52,362
Spoons have rounded tops
and are used to scoop things.

260
00:13:53,273 --> 00:13:55,138
What we need are forks,

261
00:13:55,209 --> 00:13:59,043
which have prongs
or tiny spears on top.

262
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:02,879
And we need knives,
which have blades.

263
00:14:03,784 --> 00:14:05,513
Do you understand me now?

264
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:07,619
Yes.

265
00:14:07,688 --> 00:14:08,950
Goodie.

266
00:14:13,594 --> 00:14:14,822
Hey, man.
What's up, man?

267
00:14:14,895 --> 00:14:16,726
What's going on?
Paper delivery.

268
00:14:16,797 --> 00:14:18,458
Oh, yeah?
Kelly ordered this online.

269
00:14:30,244 --> 00:14:31,370
What are you doing?

270
00:14:31,445 --> 00:14:33,242
I am in the fight of my
life against this computer,

271
00:14:33,313 --> 00:14:34,575
and every sale counts.

272
00:14:34,648 --> 00:14:37,276
But you get to put the paper in this
little shopping cart and then it says,

273
00:14:37,351 --> 00:14:39,842
"Thanks for shopping
with Dunder Mifflin."

274
00:14:40,087 --> 00:14:43,784
Damn it, Kelly! It knows!
It knows what you did!

275
00:14:43,857 --> 00:14:44,881
Who knows?

276
00:14:44,958 --> 00:14:45,982
Return it!
Return it now!

277
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:47,288
Hey.

278
00:14:48,328 --> 00:14:50,455
How about instead of yelling at
our sweet little Miss Kapour

279
00:14:50,531 --> 00:14:53,193
over 500 sheets of paper,
you get back to your desk

280
00:14:53,267 --> 00:14:55,827
and start selling multiple
reams like a man.

281
00:14:56,637 --> 00:14:58,161
You don't understand.

282
00:14:59,273 --> 00:15:00,831
Okay, if this makes
the difference,

283
00:15:00,908 --> 00:15:04,036
I'm going to tell it
that you were responsible.

284
00:15:04,111 --> 00:15:05,806
Who's "it"?

285
00:15:11,251 --> 00:15:12,240
There you go.

286
00:15:12,319 --> 00:15:13,650
Thanks.

287
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:15,517
So, you still
missing Ryan?

288
00:15:16,156 --> 00:15:17,646
Not so much anymore.

289
00:15:22,763 --> 00:15:24,424
I am not a bad person.

290
00:15:24,498 --> 00:15:26,989
When I left Staples, I took
some of their leads with me,

291
00:15:27,067 --> 00:15:29,126
but I never intended
to use them.

292
00:15:29,203 --> 00:15:30,966
What did I intend
to do with them?

293
00:15:31,405 --> 00:15:34,670
Who knows? Maybe keep
them as a souvenir,

294
00:15:34,741 --> 00:15:35,867
maybe use them.

295
00:15:36,477 --> 00:15:39,810
Yes, Mr. Galioto, how would you
like to pay 10%% less for paper

296
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:41,780
than you're
paying right now?

297
00:15:42,483 --> 00:15:44,542
It's not important how I
got your information.

298
00:15:44,618 --> 00:15:48,645
What is important
is that you say yes. Good.

299
00:15:48,722 --> 00:15:51,282
All right, I'm ready to go,
and I'm calling shotgun.

300
00:15:51,358 --> 00:15:52,347
I'm driving?

301
00:15:52,426 --> 00:15:53,859
Yes.
Thank you.

302
00:15:53,927 --> 00:15:55,519
All right. Let me just
say goodbye to Pam.

303
00:15:55,596 --> 00:15:59,464
Oh, yeah. You better say goodbye to Pam.
Say goodbye to Pam.

304
00:16:00,334 --> 00:16:03,633
Bye.
I love you.

305
00:16:07,074 --> 00:16:08,541
I love you. Okay.

306
00:16:08,609 --> 00:16:11,476
I'm leaving
inside Jim's car

307
00:16:11,545 --> 00:16:13,809
I don't know
when I'll be back again

308
00:16:13,881 --> 00:16:18,716
Yes, I do,
tomorrow I'll be back

309
00:16:18,785 --> 00:16:20,309
I'll be back tomorrow.

310
00:16:20,821 --> 00:16:24,552
Yeah, so you know what? Why don't you
guys take off a little bit early tonight?

311
00:16:24,625 --> 00:16:26,217
Because there's a party.

312
00:16:26,293 --> 00:16:29,626
A party for the website I've
been planning for two weeks.

313
00:16:29,696 --> 00:16:33,962
If you are not this tall, you
may not ride the rollercoaster.

314
00:16:34,034 --> 00:16:35,092
See you guys tomorrow.

315
00:16:35,169 --> 00:16:38,263
Perfect. So let me just get some
basic information from you.

316
00:16:47,114 --> 00:16:50,982
Sorry. I'm so sorry. Yes.
Could you repeat that?

317
00:16:53,754 --> 00:16:56,746
Yes! Ten reams for the
U.S. District Court!

318
00:16:58,425 --> 00:17:00,950
Did I happen to mention the 40 reams
for the Battered Women's Shelter?

319
00:17:01,028 --> 00:17:02,256
No!

320
00:17:07,134 --> 00:17:09,466
Stop it. Give me that. Give it.

321
00:17:10,037 --> 00:17:11,265
Did you see the board?

322
00:17:11,338 --> 00:17:13,272
There's still an hour.

323
00:17:15,475 --> 00:17:17,204
You ever read this?

324
00:17:17,277 --> 00:17:20,337
Yeah. A long time
ago, but I liked it.

325
00:17:20,414 --> 00:17:21,779
I got it for Ryan.

326
00:17:22,216 --> 00:17:24,047
I wanted to get him
Oh, the Places You'll Go!

327
00:17:24,117 --> 00:17:25,175
But they were sold out.

328
00:17:25,252 --> 00:17:28,187
I figured it's the same
sort of stuff in here.

329
00:17:28,255 --> 00:17:30,780
It's not. It's different.
It's a good book.

330
00:17:33,093 --> 00:17:34,151
What was that?

331
00:17:34,228 --> 00:17:35,889
Leaving Pennsylvania.

332
00:17:37,531 --> 00:17:38,964
Two kisses.

333
00:17:39,032 --> 00:17:40,294
One for me.
One for Jan.

334
00:17:40,367 --> 00:17:41,391
Gotcha.

335
00:17:41,468 --> 00:17:42,992
You guys should come over
for dinner, you and Pam.

336
00:17:43,070 --> 00:17:44,560
That would be fun. F'riday?
That would be fun.

337
00:17:44,638 --> 00:17:46,538
Want to come over F'riday?
Can't.

338
00:17:46,607 --> 00:17:48,131
After work, you...

339
00:17:48,208 --> 00:17:49,835
Oh, no, 'cause...

340
00:17:52,779 --> 00:17:54,303
You're gonna let me know
when we're close, right?

341
00:17:54,381 --> 00:17:56,349
Yes. Actually, I will
tell you right now.

342
00:17:56,416 --> 00:18:00,876
It's a club called Chat Room, and
there's a password to get in,

343
00:18:00,954 --> 00:18:03,218
which is actually
"Password," so...

344
00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:04,382
Okay.

345
00:18:05,092 --> 00:18:06,320
What are you doing?

346
00:18:06,393 --> 00:18:08,554
That is an invitation
to an online party.

347
00:18:09,029 --> 00:18:10,860
No. No.
I'm sure that's not.

348
00:18:11,732 --> 00:18:15,361
Are there three "W's" at the
beginning of the address?

349
00:18:17,771 --> 00:18:19,136
Yes.
Yeah.

350
00:18:20,974 --> 00:18:26,537
Well, the invitation says VIPs only.
Is this how you treat your VIPs, Ryan?

351
00:18:27,614 --> 00:18:29,809
We're already
in the city.

352
00:18:29,883 --> 00:18:33,284
The main part, with the buildings.
What am I supposed to do?

353
00:18:33,353 --> 00:18:34,513
What do you want me
to do tonight?

354
00:18:34,588 --> 00:18:35,816
And if you tell me

355
00:18:35,889 --> 00:18:38,881
that I have to drive back to
Scranton to the satellite party,

356
00:18:38,959 --> 00:18:40,654
I am going to throw up.

357
00:18:42,062 --> 00:18:43,689
Okay, I am going
to throw up.

358
00:18:43,764 --> 00:18:46,232
I'm throwing up. You're
making me throw up, Ryan.

359
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:48,495
You know what this is like? I'll
tell you what this is like.

360
00:18:48,568 --> 00:18:50,763
This is like when the
freshmen would throw a party

361
00:18:50,837 --> 00:18:53,203
and wouldn't let
any of the seniors go.

362
00:18:55,275 --> 00:18:59,234
Doesn't it just piss you off sometimes that
little twerp got the promotion over us?

363
00:18:59,313 --> 00:19:01,577
Actually, I withdrew
from consideration.

364
00:19:01,648 --> 00:19:03,479
Yeah. I withdrew too.

365
00:19:12,059 --> 00:19:16,393
F'our, three, two, one!

366
00:19:16,463 --> 00:19:17,760
Yes!

367
00:19:19,966 --> 00:19:22,332
After numerous projections
that the computer

368
00:19:22,402 --> 00:19:24,632
would crush all
salesmen in its path,

369
00:19:24,705 --> 00:19:29,267
I am very happy to report that
our very own Dwight Schrute

370
00:19:29,343 --> 00:19:33,507
has crushed his electronic
nemesis, if you will,

371
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:35,946
by a whopping 52 reams.

372
00:19:36,016 --> 00:19:37,244
Reams.

373
00:19:37,484 --> 00:19:39,042
- Wait, say it again.
- Announce it again.

374
00:19:39,119 --> 00:19:40,108
F'ifty-two reams!

375
00:19:40,187 --> 00:19:41,245
No, no.
No, the first part.

376
00:19:41,321 --> 00:19:43,983
Dwight has
defeated the computer.

377
00:19:45,158 --> 00:19:49,094
Hey, so,
what do you think?

378
00:19:50,564 --> 00:19:51,895
I did it for you.

379
00:19:51,965 --> 00:19:53,796
I didn't ask you
to do it for me.

380
00:19:54,201 --> 00:19:55,725
You didn't have to.

381
00:19:57,170 --> 00:19:59,070
How do you tell
someone it's over?

382
00:19:59,139 --> 00:20:03,633
You send them a notarized letter, right?
Well, what if the recipient is your notary?

383
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,313
Hello, Pam.

384
00:20:08,382 --> 00:20:10,145
Hello.
Hey,

385
00:20:10,217 --> 00:20:12,583
do you have any men that
you can fix me up with?

386
00:20:12,652 --> 00:20:15,348
I would like to have
a relationship with a man.

387
00:20:17,290 --> 00:20:18,723
I'll get back to you.

388
00:20:18,792 --> 00:20:20,259
Let me know.

389
00:20:35,909 --> 00:20:37,672
All right,
who wants to party?

390
00:20:37,744 --> 00:20:38,802
Why aren't you
in New York?

391
00:20:38,879 --> 00:20:40,437
What?

392
00:20:40,514 --> 00:20:42,482
I think I faked
Oscar out.

393
00:20:42,549 --> 00:20:44,813
You said you weren't coming
back and we could leave early.

394
00:20:44,885 --> 00:20:46,648
I think I faked
Stanley out, too.

395
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:49,655
Who else thought that I was leaving
and that you could all go home early?

396
00:20:49,723 --> 00:20:52,351
Gotcha, gotcha, gotcha.

397
00:20:52,426 --> 00:20:54,587
Well, who needs New York?

398
00:20:54,661 --> 00:20:57,186
Right? We can have a killer
party right here in Scranton.

399
00:20:57,264 --> 00:20:58,356
Thank you.

400
00:20:58,432 --> 00:21:01,458
No, no, no. This is going to be nothing
like the party you've been planning.

401
00:21:01,535 --> 00:21:05,130
This is going to be good,
and everybody's gonna come.

402
00:21:06,273 --> 00:21:07,968
What's wrong with Dwight?

403
00:21:08,041 --> 00:21:09,099
He beat the computer.

404
00:21:09,176 --> 00:21:13,010
Hey, good for you. Good for you!
Scranton power.

405
00:21:14,147 --> 00:21:15,409
All right, you know what?

406
00:21:15,482 --> 00:21:17,575
Angela, I'd like you to come
into my office in 10 minutes.

407
00:21:17,651 --> 00:21:20,051
Bring something to write with
and something to write on.

408
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:21,178
Good!

409
00:21:24,558 --> 00:21:26,958
It was a pretty
disappointing day.

410
00:21:27,027 --> 00:21:31,361
It was kind of a slap
in the face to realize that

411
00:21:32,265 --> 00:21:34,893
I wasn't as important
as I thought I was

412
00:21:34,968 --> 00:21:38,096
to a certain young executive
who I'd cared about.

413
00:21:38,672 --> 00:21:41,664
But, you know,
I'm not gonna cry over it.

414
00:21:42,542 --> 00:21:44,134
I did that in the car
on the way home.

415
00:21:44,478 --> 00:21:45,536
How are we
doing on time?

416
00:21:45,612 --> 00:21:46,840
The party starts
in an hour.

417
00:21:46,913 --> 00:21:50,280
Good. These are some things that
I would like to have happen.

418
00:21:52,052 --> 00:21:54,486
"Beer, light beer,
streamers, orchids,

419
00:21:54,554 --> 00:21:56,351
"better lighting,
something made of ice"?

420
00:21:56,423 --> 00:21:58,152
Those are just things.
This is how I want it to feel.

421
00:21:58,225 --> 00:22:01,626
"Pizza, pizza with mushrooms, pizza
without mushrooms, white pizza, steak"?

422
00:22:01,695 --> 00:22:05,062
I would like this
party to be sexier,

423
00:22:05,131 --> 00:22:06,792
cooler, more important...

424
00:22:06,867 --> 00:22:08,664
"Chocolates,
someone famous"?

425
00:22:08,735 --> 00:22:09,827
Yes.
"Cool music,

426
00:22:09,903 --> 00:22:11,768
"confetti,
go-go dancers"?

427
00:22:11,838 --> 00:22:14,636
I want it to embarrass
all other parties.

428
00:22:14,708 --> 00:22:18,041
I want it to be a party
that the guys in New York

429
00:22:18,111 --> 00:22:22,639
watch on the webcam and say, "Wow,
how did they get Al Roker to come?"

430
00:22:23,350 --> 00:22:24,647
I can't do this.
Yes, you can.

431
00:22:24,718 --> 00:22:25,707
I can't do it.

432
00:22:25,785 --> 00:22:27,514
Yes, you can.
I know you can.

433
00:22:27,587 --> 00:22:30,021
I wouldn't say that if
I didn't 100%% believe it.

434
00:22:30,090 --> 00:22:31,717
Who else could do this?

435
00:22:32,726 --> 00:22:34,057
Okay. Okay.

436
00:22:34,127 --> 00:22:36,095
No, seriously, is there anyone
else who could do it better?

437
00:22:36,162 --> 00:22:38,357
Because we don't
have a lot of time.

438
00:22:40,033 --> 00:22:41,796
I'll get the pizza!

439
00:22:50,010 --> 00:22:51,841
What do you
think of Angela?

440
00:22:53,747 --> 00:22:55,214
I think she's efficient.

441
00:22:55,282 --> 00:22:57,750
No, not like that.
As a woman.

442
00:22:58,451 --> 00:23:01,420
W-O-M-A-N.

443
00:23:01,488 --> 00:23:03,422
I hadn't noticed.

444
00:23:03,490 --> 00:23:05,583
You hadn't noticed
she's a woman?

445
00:23:07,427 --> 00:23:09,827
I hear she's single
and ready to mingle.

446
00:23:10,063 --> 00:23:12,531
I'm thinking about
making a play for her.

447
00:23:12,699 --> 00:23:14,690
What do you think?
Crazy, right?

448
00:23:15,201 --> 00:23:18,364
I think it's inappropriate to
date someone you work with.

449
00:23:18,638 --> 00:23:19,866
Isn't that
part of the fun?

450
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:22,170
No. I think you
should date Kelly.

451
00:23:23,209 --> 00:23:25,905
She works here, too.
How is that any different?

452
00:23:26,346 --> 00:23:28,143
She works in the annex.

453
00:23:29,115 --> 00:23:31,208
You're also welcome
to date Toby.

454
00:23:33,486 --> 00:23:34,578
Okay.

455
00:23:35,589 --> 00:23:37,580
Good news!
We get to go home?

456
00:23:37,657 --> 00:23:42,151
Guess who just ordered from your
favorite pizza place, Alfredo.

457
00:23:42,729 --> 00:23:43,821
Wait.

458
00:23:44,564 --> 00:23:48,466
Alfredo's Pizza Cafe?
Or Pizza By Alfredo?

459
00:23:49,002 --> 00:23:50,060
Same thing.

460
00:23:50,136 --> 00:23:51,433
No. No, it's not.

461
00:23:51,504 --> 00:23:52,869
All right. You know what?
I don't understand

462
00:23:52,939 --> 00:23:54,133
when you all talk
at the same time.

463
00:23:54,207 --> 00:23:56,573
Oscar, talk to him.

464
00:23:56,643 --> 00:23:59,578
Michael, there's a very big difference
between these two pizza places,

465
00:23:59,646 --> 00:24:03,878
both in quality of ingredients
and in overall taste.

466
00:24:03,950 --> 00:24:05,850
Which one did you
order from?

467
00:24:07,420 --> 00:24:09,285
Pizza By Alfredo.

468
00:24:09,356 --> 00:24:12,154
All right, you know what?
Okay, okay, what is better?

469
00:24:12,225 --> 00:24:17,288
A medium amount of good pizza or all
you can eat of pretty good pizza?

470
00:24:17,364 --> 00:24:19,798
Medium amount of good pizza.
Medium amount of good pizza.

471
00:24:21,267 --> 00:24:25,829
Oh, no, it's bad.
It's real bad.

472
00:24:26,706 --> 00:24:29,573
It's like eating
a hot circle of garbage.

473
00:24:32,712 --> 00:24:35,272
You can pick
one of these things.

474
00:24:35,348 --> 00:24:38,374
It's unreasonable for you to
ask me to do all of this.

475
00:24:39,052 --> 00:24:42,818
It should take you no time at all if you
put the care into it that you normally do.

476
00:24:46,426 --> 00:24:47,620
Ow!

477
00:24:47,694 --> 00:24:49,423
That seemed
to shut her up.

478
00:24:52,932 --> 00:24:53,921
You looking for
dinner and a movie?

479
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,730
'Cause you're not gonna
find it in that box.

480
00:24:58,938 --> 00:25:02,305
It just so happens, I know where
you can find it, but again,

481
00:25:03,977 --> 00:25:06,002
not in the box.

482
00:25:09,249 --> 00:25:11,615
Angela, are you hearing
words that I'm saying?

483
00:25:11,685 --> 00:25:12,845
What?

484
00:25:12,919 --> 00:25:14,113
Hello.

485
00:25:14,954 --> 00:25:16,649
I have been working
on a party for three weeks

486
00:25:16,723 --> 00:25:18,122
that just got thrown
out the window,

487
00:25:18,191 --> 00:25:20,386
so now I have to pull
together a whole new party,

488
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:22,223
and my useless
number two quit.

489
00:25:22,295 --> 00:25:23,922
So now there's no one
in charge of orchids,

490
00:25:23,997 --> 00:25:25,988
chocolates or the thing
that's made of ice.

491
00:25:26,066 --> 00:25:27,863
And my upper back itches,
and it's itched all day,

492
00:25:27,934 --> 00:25:31,392
and I can't reach it. And Kevin
had Greek food for lunch again!

493
00:25:35,108 --> 00:25:38,202
They say you should never mix
business with pleasure.

494
00:25:38,278 --> 00:25:39,302
Really?

495
00:25:39,379 --> 00:25:43,179
Well, then explain to me how a
putt-putt golf company operates.

496
00:25:48,288 --> 00:25:49,312
Yeah?

497
00:25:49,389 --> 00:25:51,050
The Pizza By Alfredo
guy is here.

498
00:25:51,124 --> 00:25:52,352
You don't have
to say it like that.

499
00:25:52,425 --> 00:25:53,653
I said it normal.

500
00:25:58,198 --> 00:25:59,597
Hey.
Hey.

501
00:25:59,666 --> 00:26:02,100
$63.50, and that's
not including tip.

502
00:26:02,168 --> 00:26:03,658
Right.
I have a coupon,

503
00:26:03,737 --> 00:26:07,434
so half of $63.50 and
half the tip on $63.50...

504
00:26:07,507 --> 00:26:10,442
Half-off coupons only apply
to orders of two pizzas.

505
00:26:10,510 --> 00:26:13,240
Yeah, no, I told them on the phone
I was ordering eight pizzas.

506
00:26:13,313 --> 00:26:14,746
I don't care what you
told them on the phone.

507
00:26:14,814 --> 00:26:16,543
That's our policy.

508
00:26:16,616 --> 00:26:19,449
You didn't actually think that I was
going to spend 60 bucks on pizza?

509
00:26:19,519 --> 00:26:20,781
It's not pizza.
Okay.

510
00:26:20,854 --> 00:26:25,257
It doesn't say it anywhere on the
coupon, and if it's your policy,

511
00:26:25,325 --> 00:26:27,316
it should say it
on the coupon.

512
00:26:27,861 --> 00:26:29,419
What do you mean?

513
00:26:29,496 --> 00:26:30,520
Not my problem.

514
00:26:30,597 --> 00:26:32,064
It is your problem.

515
00:26:32,899 --> 00:26:37,632
That's no way to do business, okay?
I ordered

516
00:26:37,704 --> 00:26:39,137
eight pizzas with
a half-off coupon,

517
00:26:39,205 --> 00:26:42,572
so I would like eight pizzas for half-off.
End of story.

518
00:26:42,642 --> 00:26:46,373
It's a great story. It's $63.50,
and that's not including tip.

519
00:26:46,446 --> 00:26:47,936
I'm not giving that to you.

520
00:26:48,014 --> 00:26:50,039
Well, then you're not
getting your pizzas.

521
00:26:50,116 --> 00:26:52,084
No. No!
You're not... No!

522
00:26:52,152 --> 00:26:55,713
You are not going anywhere!
You're going to stay here

523
00:26:55,789 --> 00:26:58,053
until we figure this out! What?

524
00:26:58,124 --> 00:27:03,187
You know what? This young man needs to learn
that that's not how you treat people!

525
00:27:04,264 --> 00:27:05,629
I don't care if it's pizza!

526
00:27:05,698 --> 00:27:10,101
Good business is about respect and
accountability and follow-through.

527
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:11,933
You don't just
make promises

528
00:27:12,005 --> 00:27:14,974
and pull the rug out from
under somebody, do you?

529
00:27:15,041 --> 00:27:17,874
Dwight, please escort this young
man into the conference room.

530
00:27:17,944 --> 00:27:19,138
Right now. Get into
the conference room.

531
00:27:19,212 --> 00:27:20,770
I'm not going in there. Yeah, you are.
Yeah, you are.

532
00:27:20,847 --> 00:27:23,645
And you will come out when you decide
to give me a discount on the pizza.

533
00:27:23,716 --> 00:27:25,115
Please. Thank you.

534
00:27:25,819 --> 00:27:26,843
This is stupid.

535
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:29,650
No, you don't even
know what stupid is.

536
00:27:30,657 --> 00:27:33,592
It's about to get
all stupid up in here!

537
00:27:47,006 --> 00:27:48,871
You find anything?

538
00:27:48,942 --> 00:27:51,433
We think it's a
straightforward kidnapping.

539
00:27:52,045 --> 00:27:53,842
Stanley, could you
look up accomplices?

540
00:27:53,913 --> 00:27:55,278
Why can't you guys do it?

541
00:27:55,348 --> 00:27:57,509
Because we're
looking up jail time.

542
00:27:57,851 --> 00:27:59,409
F'ine.

543
00:27:59,485 --> 00:28:00,543
I've seen this kid before.

544
00:28:00,620 --> 00:28:03,020
He's one of the kids that sneaks
onto my farm and steals my hemp.

545
00:28:03,356 --> 00:28:06,883
Yeah, I know that guy. He's that
farmer that grows really crappy weed.

546
00:28:14,801 --> 00:28:16,792
You ready to give me
my discount now?

547
00:28:16,870 --> 00:28:17,962
No.

548
00:28:18,504 --> 00:28:20,404
Okay, what have you been doing
in here this whole time?

549
00:28:20,473 --> 00:28:21,735
What kind of
business is this?

550
00:28:21,808 --> 00:28:22,934
We're a paper company.

551
00:28:23,009 --> 00:28:24,704
The best paper company
in the whole wide world, okay?

552
00:28:24,777 --> 00:28:26,802
All right, Dwight,
knock it off.

553
00:28:28,014 --> 00:28:30,039
You'd better think about what
you are doing, young man.

554
00:28:30,116 --> 00:28:31,640
You better think about
what you're doing.

555
00:28:31,718 --> 00:28:36,246
No! I'm an adult. I don't
have to think or do anything.

556
00:28:36,322 --> 00:28:39,689
You're a kid. You're a
little, snot-nosed punk kid

557
00:28:39,759 --> 00:28:41,920
who thinks he's better
than everybody else,

558
00:28:41,995 --> 00:28:43,428
because he's some hotshot.

559
00:28:43,496 --> 00:28:45,896
And you don't know
anything about sales!

560
00:28:45,965 --> 00:28:47,990
So stop being a disrespectful
little jerk, okay?

561
00:28:48,067 --> 00:28:49,125
Sales?

562
00:28:49,202 --> 00:28:51,762
Yes, sales. You sell pizza. Last
time I checked, that's called sales.

563
00:28:51,838 --> 00:28:52,827
You're such a loser.

564
00:28:52,906 --> 00:28:53,895
What did you
just call him?

565
00:28:53,973 --> 00:28:55,668
A loser.
What did you say?

566
00:28:55,742 --> 00:28:56,902
A loser.
What?

567
00:28:56,976 --> 00:28:58,273
A loser.
What was that word?

568
00:28:58,344 --> 00:29:00,141
Stop getting him
to say it!

569
00:29:00,613 --> 00:29:02,513
You just made this worse,
a whole lot worse.

570
00:29:02,582 --> 00:29:03,879
I can make
him talk, Michael.

571
00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:04,939
- Michael!
- Michael!

572
00:29:05,018 --> 00:29:06,485
We are accomplices. I'm not
going to jail for this.

573
00:29:06,552 --> 00:29:08,144
Stop talking all at once!

574
00:29:08,221 --> 00:29:09,347
You need to let him go.

575
00:29:09,422 --> 00:29:12,789
Let go of little jerk-boy before
he has learned his lesson?

576
00:29:12,859 --> 00:29:14,451
Yes.
You know what, Jim?

577
00:29:14,527 --> 00:29:18,429
The world would be a better place if people
were held accountable for their actions.

578
00:29:18,498 --> 00:29:20,295
Yes, but not by
kidnapping them.

579
00:29:20,366 --> 00:29:21,731
I'm not kidnapping him.

580
00:29:21,801 --> 00:29:24,099
I'm keeping him
until I get what I want.

581
00:29:24,170 --> 00:29:25,262
As a hostage.

582
00:29:25,338 --> 00:29:26,362
I think you're
over-thinking it.

583
00:29:26,439 --> 00:29:27,463
I think you're
under-thinking it.

584
00:29:27,540 --> 00:29:29,167
Yes.
Is Alfredo there?

585
00:29:30,643 --> 00:29:32,577
May I speak to
a manager, then?

586
00:29:33,279 --> 00:29:37,375
Okay, could you tell the manager
that I am keeping his delivery kid

587
00:29:37,450 --> 00:29:40,180
until I get my discount on
the eight pizzas I ordered?

588
00:29:40,887 --> 00:29:43,082
Yes, I know it is
not on the coupon.

589
00:29:44,023 --> 00:29:49,984
Also, I would like him to
throw in two, three pizzas,

590
00:29:50,997 --> 00:29:52,464
just for our...
Ransom.

591
00:29:52,532 --> 00:29:53,624
trouble.

592
00:29:55,368 --> 00:29:57,336
Okay. All right.

593
00:29:58,838 --> 00:30:00,169
What did he say?

594
00:30:00,239 --> 00:30:01,263
He said no.

595
00:30:01,341 --> 00:30:02,535
So we should let him go.

596
00:30:02,608 --> 00:30:03,939
No. No.

597
00:30:04,010 --> 00:30:05,136
Okay.

598
00:30:05,211 --> 00:30:07,577
Listen up, kid,

599
00:30:08,281 --> 00:30:09,612
I don't like you,

600
00:30:09,682 --> 00:30:13,812
but because some town in Switzerland
says so, you have rights.

601
00:30:18,925 --> 00:30:20,449
I have to hang these.

602
00:30:28,401 --> 00:30:30,096
Why are you looking
at her like that?

603
00:30:30,169 --> 00:30:31,363
Hey!

604
00:30:42,348 --> 00:30:43,610
What's going on?

605
00:30:43,683 --> 00:30:45,742
Michael just called the pizza
place with a list of demands.

606
00:30:45,818 --> 00:30:47,445
Mr. Overdramatic.
What's up, Kevin?

607
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:49,511
We're getting hungry
out there.

608
00:30:50,623 --> 00:30:55,458
We're all accomplices now anyway,
so we figured we might as well eat.

609
00:30:55,528 --> 00:31:00,431
We would like to order some good
pizza from Alfredo's Pizza Cafe

610
00:31:00,933 --> 00:31:05,063
while we wait for the hostage
situation with the bad pizza to end.

611
00:31:08,207 --> 00:31:11,643
I needed another hour. It could
have been done in another hour.

612
00:31:11,711 --> 00:31:13,440
I think it looks good.

613
00:31:13,513 --> 00:31:15,481
That's why you're not
in charge, Meredith.

614
00:31:20,653 --> 00:31:23,713
Here you are, my dear.
One thing made of ice.

615
00:31:26,592 --> 00:31:27,991
How did you...

616
00:31:29,295 --> 00:31:30,728
Where'd you...

617
00:31:30,797 --> 00:31:33,561
It's just ice. It'll
melt all over the floor.

618
00:31:33,633 --> 00:31:34,895
Will you help me
put it over there?

619
00:31:34,967 --> 00:31:36,491
Yes, I will.
Okay.

620
00:31:36,569 --> 00:31:37,729
Excuse me.

621
00:31:38,905 --> 00:31:39,997
I stole it.

622
00:31:44,310 --> 00:31:45,709
Thank God.

623
00:31:45,778 --> 00:31:49,680
Michael? Ryan wants to introduce the
branch managers in a few minutes.

624
00:31:49,749 --> 00:31:51,808
You just have to wave
and introduce yourself.

625
00:31:51,884 --> 00:31:54,182
I'll just wave and
introduce myself.

626
00:31:54,253 --> 00:31:55,618
Hey, quick question.

627
00:31:55,688 --> 00:31:56,712
Yeah?

628
00:31:56,789 --> 00:31:58,689
If I take a pizza,

629
00:31:58,758 --> 00:32:02,524
do you think you could take some sodas
and some napkins up to the roof?

630
00:32:02,595 --> 00:32:04,495
I'm all over it.
Good.

631
00:32:05,398 --> 00:32:07,161
What do we got here?

632
00:32:07,233 --> 00:32:08,825
Good pizza.
Yeah?

633
00:32:08,901 --> 00:32:10,892
Cheese? Or do we
have other flavors?

634
00:32:10,970 --> 00:32:12,062
Different stuff.

635
00:32:12,138 --> 00:32:13,935
Which one is this?
Perfect.

636
00:32:16,676 --> 00:32:19,440
Do you remember what you said
to me on my first day at work,

637
00:32:19,512 --> 00:32:21,036
just before you walked
me over to my desk?

638
00:32:21,114 --> 00:32:22,308
Yeah.

639
00:32:23,349 --> 00:32:26,546
"Enjoy this moment, because you're
never going to go back to this time

640
00:32:26,619 --> 00:32:29,019
"before you met
your desk-mate, Dwight."

641
00:32:29,422 --> 00:32:32,721
And that's why
I knew. You?

642
00:32:32,792 --> 00:32:35,260
You came up to
my desk and you said,

643
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:40,231
"This might sound weird, and there's
no reason for me to know this,

644
00:32:40,299 --> 00:32:43,393
"but that mixed-berry yogurt
you're about to eat has expired."

645
00:32:43,469 --> 00:32:45,630
That was the moment that
you knew you liked me?

646
00:32:45,705 --> 00:32:46,797
Yup.

647
00:32:46,873 --> 00:32:48,135
Wow.

648
00:32:50,176 --> 00:32:51,438
Can we make it
a different moment?

649
00:32:51,511 --> 00:32:52,637
Nope.

650
00:32:54,547 --> 00:32:56,037
Can I start talking?

651
00:32:57,216 --> 00:33:01,016
Is this thing on? Give me a
signal when you want me to start.

652
00:33:03,256 --> 00:33:07,920
And now from my old hometown, Scranton,
Pennsylvania, my former boss,

653
00:33:07,994 --> 00:33:09,621
Michael Scott.

654
00:33:10,229 --> 00:33:11,628
Hey, I just think
you should know

655
00:33:11,697 --> 00:33:14,689
that one of my salesmen
beat your stupid computer.

656
00:33:14,767 --> 00:33:16,394
So take that,

657
00:33:18,905 --> 00:33:20,463
Always a jokester.

658
00:33:23,075 --> 00:33:25,270
How about that image?
Crystal clear.

659
00:33:26,746 --> 00:33:30,614
If anyone out there is listening, I
am being held here against my will.

660
00:33:30,683 --> 00:33:31,877
I'm a minor.

661
00:33:35,888 --> 00:33:36,912
Ow!

662
00:33:36,989 --> 00:33:38,183
What are you doing?

663
00:33:38,257 --> 00:33:40,157
You said your
upper back itched.

664
00:33:40,226 --> 00:33:41,784
I didn't ask you
to scratch it.

665
00:33:41,861 --> 00:33:44,193
Look, Angela, I know this is
weird because we work together,

666
00:33:44,263 --> 00:33:48,893
and because up until and possibly
including now I've repulsed you,

667
00:33:48,968 --> 00:33:50,299
but I like you.

668
00:33:50,369 --> 00:33:52,064
I'm not dating you.

669
00:33:54,407 --> 00:33:57,308
So Angela is
stubborn as a mule.

670
00:33:58,811 --> 00:34:02,872
She's giving off fairly strong
vibes that she's not interested.

671
00:34:07,019 --> 00:34:08,748
But do I like her or not?

672
00:34:09,956 --> 00:34:14,222
Because if I like her,
then I can't back down.

673
00:34:16,195 --> 00:34:19,426
If you're going number one,
you've got 10 more seconds.

674
00:34:22,201 --> 00:34:23,532
Hey, have you seen Jim?

675
00:34:23,603 --> 00:34:27,004
I guess he wanted to get out of
here before the cops find out.

676
00:34:30,243 --> 00:34:33,337
Hey, what are you doing?
I'm just scaring him.

677
00:34:33,412 --> 00:34:35,972
Now the trick is to make him think
you're going to do something to him.

678
00:34:36,048 --> 00:34:37,242
I can hear you, man.
Shut up,

679
00:34:37,316 --> 00:34:38,613
or I'm going to
punch you in the throat!

680
00:34:38,684 --> 00:34:40,242
Hey, hey, hey,
stop it. Stop it.

681
00:34:40,319 --> 00:34:42,617
No. God.
Oh, my God.

682
00:34:43,923 --> 00:34:47,518
Oh, my God.
Oh, no. No.

683
00:34:49,061 --> 00:34:51,188
I kidnapped a kid.
You had to.

684
00:34:51,264 --> 00:34:53,027
What other choice
did you have?

685
00:34:53,099 --> 00:34:55,226
I could have
paid for the pizza.

686
00:34:55,301 --> 00:34:57,769
Well, yeah.

687
00:35:00,006 --> 00:35:03,464
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

688
00:35:06,245 --> 00:35:07,234
This is Michael.

689
00:35:07,313 --> 00:35:08,405
Hello, Michael.
This is Ryan.

690
00:35:08,481 --> 00:35:10,039
First off, thanks
for the shout out.

691
00:35:10,116 --> 00:35:11,743
You're breaking up.
I can't hear you.

692
00:35:11,817 --> 00:35:13,910
And why is there
a kid on your webcam

693
00:35:13,986 --> 00:35:16,250
saying that he's
being held against his...

694
00:35:17,089 --> 00:35:18,454
Okay.

695
00:35:18,524 --> 00:35:21,823
I want you to go in there

696
00:35:21,894 --> 00:35:25,887
and pay him for the pizzas
and give him a generous tip,

697
00:35:27,033 --> 00:35:28,227
no more than 10%%.

698
00:35:28,301 --> 00:35:29,461
What will you do?

699
00:35:29,535 --> 00:35:32,265
I will open the door.

700
00:35:33,072 --> 00:35:34,232
Yeah.

701
00:35:34,307 --> 00:35:36,400
And hopefully
he will walk out.

702
00:35:38,911 --> 00:35:41,004
And the rest
is out of our hands.

703
00:35:42,415 --> 00:35:45,077
So I'm paying full price?

704
00:35:45,151 --> 00:35:46,243
Yes.

705
00:35:47,286 --> 00:35:50,653
Here we go, 65.
You know what?

706
00:35:51,791 --> 00:35:53,156
Here's two more.

707
00:35:58,164 --> 00:36:00,098
See you.
Drive safely.

708
00:36:02,568 --> 00:36:04,058
Okay.

709
00:36:04,804 --> 00:36:06,203
Now what?

710
00:36:06,272 --> 00:36:09,002
Now we wait and hope
that nothing happens.

711
00:36:10,242 --> 00:36:12,938
All right. I assume I'm going to
be reimbursed for the pizzas?

712
00:36:13,012 --> 00:36:15,242
Not now, Dwight.
Please, not the time.

713
00:36:17,817 --> 00:36:19,808
A toast.

714
00:36:19,885 --> 00:36:21,614
I'm gonna make it good.

715
00:36:22,855 --> 00:36:24,948
To avoiding a class-two
felony charge.

716
00:36:32,298 --> 00:36:34,892
Hello? Hey.
Hang on a second.

717
00:36:41,540 --> 00:36:44,031
Hello. Hang on.

718
00:36:54,820 --> 00:36:57,789
If you change your mind

719
00:36:59,392 --> 00:37:01,121
I'll be first in line

720
00:37:01,193 --> 00:37:05,755
Honey, I'm still free
Take a chance on me

721
00:37:05,831 --> 00:37:08,129
If you need me, let me know

722
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:09,827
Going to be around

723
00:37:10,136 --> 00:37:12,661
If you got no place to go

724
00:37:12,738 --> 00:37:17,198
If you're feeling down,
if you're all alone

725
00:37:17,276 --> 00:37:19,642
When the pretty birds
have flown

726
00:37:19,712 --> 00:37:24,376
Honey, I'm still free
Take a chance on me

727
00:37:24,450 --> 00:37:28,887
Going to do my very best
And that ain't no lie

728
00:37:28,954 --> 00:37:33,414
If you put me to the test,
if you let me try

729
00:37:33,492 --> 00:37:37,724
Take a chance on me

730
00:37:37,797 --> 00:37:39,788
That's all I ask of you,
Angela.

731
00:37:40,466 --> 00:37:46,063
Take a chance, take a chance

732
00:37:47,473 --> 00:37:49,998
On

733
00:37:50,075 --> 00:37:54,705
Me

734
00:38:07,092 --> 00:38:09,026
- Hey, how'd it go?
- Yeah. What did she say?

735
00:38:09,094 --> 00:38:10,721
I don't know yet.

736
00:38:10,796 --> 00:38:11,820
I have to call you back.

737
00:38:11,897 --> 00:38:12,886
Come on,
you gotta give us something.

738
00:38:12,965 --> 00:38:14,398
I'll call you back.

739
00:38:16,669 --> 00:38:18,603
I have to go clean up
after the party.

740
00:38:36,655 --> 00:38:38,646
What a horrible day.

741
00:38:43,295 --> 00:38:47,254
Well, I need to get the horrible
taste of this pizza out of my mouth.

742
00:38:48,667 --> 00:38:50,464
I'd really like some sushi.

743
00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:54,101
I was hoping that I would have
New York-style sushi today,

744
00:38:54,173 --> 00:38:56,266
and you know what?

745
00:38:56,342 --> 00:38:58,139
What?
I'm gonna get it.

746
00:38:58,711 --> 00:39:00,702
Coopers has calamari.

747
00:39:00,779 --> 00:39:04,146
No. There's only one place to get
authentic New York-style sushi.

748
00:39:04,216 --> 00:39:05,683
Tokyo?
New York.

749
00:39:06,385 --> 00:39:08,285
Wanna go?
Yes.

750
00:39:08,354 --> 00:39:09,343
All right.
You drive.

751
00:39:09,421 --> 00:39:10,649
Okay.

752
00:39:10,723 --> 00:39:11,781
Nice.

753
00:39:11,857 --> 00:39:13,222
Here we go.

754
00:39:13,292 --> 00:39:14,782
Mmm.

755
00:39:14,860 --> 00:39:16,794
Perfect.
I'm sorry.

756
00:39:16,862 --> 00:39:18,762
You guys are going
to have to leave.

757
00:39:18,831 --> 00:39:20,890
Hey.
You know what?

758
00:39:24,737 --> 00:39:26,034
Come on,
come on, let's go.

759
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:37,347
Hey, you're the
Scranton guy?

760
00:39:37,416 --> 00:39:38,405
Guilty.

761
00:39:38,484 --> 00:39:40,782
I liked your
statement tonight.

762
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:42,519
Thanks.

763
00:39:43,255 --> 00:39:45,849
This is the guy that
beat the computer.

764
00:39:45,925 --> 00:39:49,190
Very cool. Yeah, it was funny to
see Ryan all embarrassed by that.

765
00:39:49,261 --> 00:39:51,195
Yeah.
Yeah.

766
00:39:51,263 --> 00:39:52,525
See you later.

767
00:39:53,532 --> 00:39:54,624
Later on.

768
00:39:56,335 --> 00:40:01,602
I'm Ryan and tonight didn't go
the way that I thought it would,

769
00:40:01,674 --> 00:40:06,304
because it didn't work out for
me, and I'm very embarrassed.

770
00:40:06,378 --> 00:40:08,209
I have egg all over my face.

771
00:40:08,514 --> 00:40:09,776
I'm 12 years old.

772
00:40:09,848 --> 00:40:12,544
I spent so much time in Scranton,
but I never sold any paper.

773
00:40:12,618 --> 00:40:15,587
I never sold any paper
because I'm an idiot.

774
00:40:15,654 --> 00:40:18,316
I started a fire
with my cheese pita.

775
00:40:18,390 --> 00:40:20,449
I dated an Indian girl.

776
00:40:20,526 --> 00:40:22,323
I started a fire.

777
00:40:22,394 --> 00:40:23,383
I started a fire.

778
00:40:23,462 --> 00:40:24,554
Now I've got a beard.

779
00:40:24,630 --> 00:40:26,097
And I got a new suit,
and I'm your boss.

780
00:40:26,165 --> 00:40:27,757
I get everything
I want 'cause I'm very...

781
00:40:27,833 --> 00:40:29,528
I'm hot. I'm so hot.

782
00:40:29,602 --> 00:40:30,796
That's why everybody...

783
00:40:30,869 --> 00:40:32,131
I didn't get...

784
00:40:32,204 --> 00:40:33,694
I don't
understand that.

785
00:40:33,772 --> 00:40:35,899
That's part of it,
just a...

786
00:40:52,591 --> 00:40:53,853
Wanna head back?

787
00:40:55,227 --> 00:40:57,024
Yeah, let's go.
