1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:01,936
I really didn't think I was gonna
have a good time, but I did.

2
00:00:02,006 --> 00:00:05,874
I totally did. I love camping.
Anything can happen.

3
00:00:05,944 --> 00:00:09,243
Oh, it wasn't camping. It was
more of a wilderness retreat.

4
00:00:09,314 --> 00:00:10,542
Morning.
Michael.

5
00:00:10,715 --> 00:00:13,616
Ryan invited some of the branch
managers and Toby into the woods

6
00:00:13,685 --> 00:00:18,145
for a get-to-know-you weekend.
Michael wasn't invited.

7
00:00:19,757 --> 00:00:23,420
Apparently they already knew everything
they needed to know about him.

8
00:00:23,494 --> 00:00:24,654
Did you sleep
in cabins?

9
00:00:24,729 --> 00:00:27,857
Under the stars. It
was really beautiful.

10
00:00:27,932 --> 00:00:31,527
You should come. Bob and I took
rock climbing lessons once.

11
00:00:34,939 --> 00:00:37,931
Michael wasn't invited
on Ryan's camping trip.

12
00:00:38,009 --> 00:00:40,102
Toby went,
but Michael didn't go.

13
00:00:40,912 --> 00:00:42,345
He wasn't invited.

14
00:00:42,847 --> 00:00:46,305
Who went? Me, Dan from
Buffalo, Mark Chisholm,

15
00:00:46,384 --> 00:00:50,184
Jack from Albany, and Ryan, obviously.
We ate so many s'mores

16
00:00:50,255 --> 00:00:54,624
I finally had to say, "No more s'mores.
No more s'mores."

17
00:00:58,963 --> 00:01:02,694
Ryan invited me to go on his
wilderness adventure retreat.

18
00:01:02,767 --> 00:01:05,429
It was this amazing,
beautiful...

19
00:01:06,204 --> 00:01:08,900
Hey. Nobody cares.
Nobody cares.

20
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:12,873
I need that room at some
point, so just wrap it up.

21
00:01:14,178 --> 00:01:15,805
Michael wasn't invited.

22
00:01:37,869 --> 00:01:40,997
Hypothetically, if I were
to ask you to go camping.

23
00:01:41,706 --> 00:01:44,334
And... Do you know
what "hypothetical" means?

24
00:01:44,409 --> 00:01:45,501
Not real.
Got it.

25
00:01:45,576 --> 00:01:49,012
So if I were to hypothetically
ask you to go camping with me,

26
00:01:49,781 --> 00:01:51,408
would you go?
Absolutely. Yes.

27
00:01:51,816 --> 00:01:55,149
When Michael plays the hypothetical
game, I always say yes.

28
00:01:55,219 --> 00:01:56,914
Really?
Yeah.

29
00:01:56,988 --> 00:01:58,353
Oh, do you want
to go today?

30
00:01:58,423 --> 00:02:00,323
And I am always busy.

31
00:02:00,391 --> 00:02:03,656
Oh, I can't go today
because I'm donating blood.

32
00:02:03,728 --> 00:02:06,925
How often can you
actually donate blood?

33
00:02:06,998 --> 00:02:08,363
Is there a limit?
I don't...

34
00:02:08,433 --> 00:02:10,492
Your body only
has a certain amount.

35
00:02:10,568 --> 00:02:12,536
Well. Is that it? Or...

36
00:02:12,603 --> 00:02:15,163
Yeah. Just this whole
Toby camping thing.

37
00:02:15,239 --> 00:02:18,470
I don't know, seems a little lame.
I mean... How so?

38
00:02:18,543 --> 00:02:21,569
A bunch of guys
in a tent making s'mores.

39
00:02:24,382 --> 00:02:27,180
What's that? Oh, I'm
on Broken Mountain.

40
00:02:27,251 --> 00:02:29,446
Here's the thing. That's
not how you go camping.

41
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:33,251
I think you go camping
by yourself in the wilderness.

42
00:02:33,324 --> 00:02:38,387
It's not with a group of guys frolicking
around in tents. It's one guy

43
00:02:38,463 --> 00:02:40,795
or two guys, if your plans change.
They're not

44
00:02:40,865 --> 00:02:44,130
I want to do it myself.
You know, I want to go

45
00:02:44,202 --> 00:02:46,329
and find out something
about myself.

46
00:02:46,404 --> 00:02:53,003
I want to get out of here. All the cliques
and the office politics, fluorescent lights.

47
00:02:53,077 --> 00:02:54,601
And the asbestos.

48
00:02:54,679 --> 00:02:55,976
I thought we had
that looked at.

49
00:02:56,047 --> 00:02:58,447
I'm sick of it, Jim.
I'm sick of this place.

50
00:02:58,716 --> 00:03:03,676
When Jan and I had satellite, we used to
watch a reality show called Survivorman.

51
00:03:03,755 --> 00:03:09,091
And it was interesting because it
was about a guy who would go out

52
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:13,153
into the middle of nowhere
and just try not to die,

53
00:03:13,231 --> 00:03:15,358
try not to get eaten
by an animal,

54
00:03:15,433 --> 00:03:18,425
or be overexposed.

55
00:03:18,603 --> 00:03:22,835
Okay, I will only need two things,
a roll of duct tape and a knife.

56
00:03:23,441 --> 00:03:25,705
I'm on it. Okay. Thirty
minutes or less.

57
00:03:25,777 --> 00:03:27,301
Please come back.

58
00:03:27,378 --> 00:03:30,711
Save the receipts.
Hey, what...

59
00:03:30,782 --> 00:03:34,650
Let's see if any of these will work.
Hey. Hey. Dwight. Dwight...

60
00:03:34,919 --> 00:03:38,252
I keep various weaponry strategically
placed around the office.

61
00:03:38,322 --> 00:03:42,383
I saved Jim's life with a can of pepper
spray I had Velcroed under my desk.

62
00:03:43,327 --> 00:03:48,765
People say, "Oh, it's dangerous to keep
weapons in the home or the workplace."

63
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,869
Well, I say it's better to be hurt
by someone you know, accidentally,

64
00:03:53,938 --> 00:03:56,406
than by a stranger on purpose.

65
00:03:58,543 --> 00:04:03,003
Dwight and I are going out. He
will return later, but I will not.

66
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:06,777
I will also be taking
a personal day tomorrow

67
00:04:06,851 --> 00:04:08,910
and perhaps the next day.

68
00:04:08,986 --> 00:04:10,385
Do you want me to ask
where you're going?

69
00:04:10,455 --> 00:04:11,615
No.

70
00:04:11,689 --> 00:04:13,247
Great. Dwight will be driving me

71
00:04:13,324 --> 00:04:15,451
deep into the Pennsylvania
wilderness. Oh.

72
00:04:15,526 --> 00:04:17,517
Where he will
then leave me

73
00:04:17,595 --> 00:04:22,123
to either die or to survive.
The choice is yours.

74
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:26,193
No. The choice is actually yours.
Are you sure you want to do this?

75
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:31,003
Yes. And I am leaving you in charge of
the office for the rest of the day,

76
00:04:31,075 --> 00:04:33,942
and for the next several days.
Do not try to follow me.

77
00:04:34,011 --> 00:04:37,606
Okay. Great. This is a very
personal, private experience

78
00:04:37,682 --> 00:04:41,550
in the wild that I wish to
share with me, myself and I.

79
00:04:41,619 --> 00:04:42,881
Yep.

80
00:04:42,954 --> 00:04:46,515
When I return, I hope to be a
completely changed human being.

81
00:04:46,591 --> 00:04:47,580
That'd be great.

82
00:04:47,658 --> 00:04:50,525
Do I believe that Michael
possesses the skills

83
00:04:50,595 --> 00:04:53,257
to survive in
a hostile environment?

84
00:04:54,432 --> 00:04:57,799
Let's put it this way.
No, I do not.

85
00:05:00,071 --> 00:05:02,062
This is what a true
Survivorman does.

86
00:05:02,139 --> 00:05:05,905
You simulate a disaster,
like a plane wreck.

87
00:05:05,977 --> 00:05:08,138
You can only wear the
clothes that you have on,

88
00:05:08,212 --> 00:05:10,874
and you can only use the stuff
that you have in your pockets.

89
00:05:10,948 --> 00:05:15,476
Now in this case, this
disaster is a serial killer,

90
00:05:15,553 --> 00:05:20,388
creepy guy who's abducted me, and is
taking me out into the wilderness

91
00:05:20,458 --> 00:05:22,619
to leave me for dead. No. I
would never leave you for dead.

92
00:05:22,693 --> 00:05:25,594
You would never escape. Well, yes, I would.
And I would survive.

93
00:05:25,663 --> 00:05:27,358
I would make sure that
you were dead. No.

94
00:05:27,431 --> 00:05:29,695
Then I would remove your teeth
and cut off your fingertips

95
00:05:29,767 --> 00:05:31,200
so you could not be identified.
You...

96
00:05:31,269 --> 00:05:32,634
And they would call me
the Overkill Killer.

97
00:05:32,703 --> 00:05:37,800
You are as creepy as a real
serial killer, for real. Okay...

98
00:05:37,875 --> 00:05:41,504
What are you doing? I am putting
this on so I have no familiarity

99
00:05:41,579 --> 00:05:43,274
with my surroundings.

100
00:05:43,347 --> 00:05:45,941
Now this way I can't
retrace my steps.

101
00:05:46,017 --> 00:05:49,714
I don't know what streets we...
Ow! What are you doing?

102
00:05:49,787 --> 00:05:51,652
It would be better if you
were unconscious. No.

103
00:05:51,722 --> 00:05:54,282
Here... God. Dwight, stop it.
Stop it. Stop it.

104
00:05:54,358 --> 00:05:56,155
Do you want to do
this right or not?

105
00:05:56,227 --> 00:06:00,561
Just please allow me to have one
cathartic experience in my life.

106
00:06:02,633 --> 00:06:05,898
Jim, we need to order a
cake for Creed's birthday.

107
00:06:05,970 --> 00:06:07,460
Oh, wasn't it just
someone's birthday?

108
00:06:07,538 --> 00:06:10,302
Yes. Kelly's was
last week, remember?

109
00:06:10,374 --> 00:06:12,934
I do remember, yeah.
It's birthday month.

110
00:06:13,010 --> 00:06:17,913
Creed's is today, Oscar's is week after next,
Meredith's is at the end of the month.

111
00:06:17,982 --> 00:06:19,643
Michael usually goes with
red and white streamers...

112
00:06:19,717 --> 00:06:23,676
You know what? I have an idea. Why don't
we just do one big, shared party?

113
00:06:24,288 --> 00:06:25,312
What?

114
00:06:25,389 --> 00:06:29,985
There are 13 people working in
this office, so 13 times a year,

115
00:06:30,061 --> 00:06:32,723
Michael gets a cake
and balloons

116
00:06:33,264 --> 00:06:36,597
and some sort of joke gift
and makes a toast.

117
00:06:36,701 --> 00:06:40,569
And there are two types of toasts. One
is a joke about how old you are...

118
00:06:40,638 --> 00:06:44,665
Look at those wrinkles. Blacks do crack.
Not crack the drug.

119
00:06:44,742 --> 00:06:50,271
And the other is something
inappropriate or horrible or both.

120
00:06:50,848 --> 00:06:54,147
What else? He only sings the
high harmony to Happy Birthday.

121
00:06:56,787 --> 00:06:59,620
And he is a very big believer
in surprise parties.

122
00:06:59,690 --> 00:07:02,284
Maybe even, arguably,
possibly to a fault.

123
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:03,759
Happy birthday!

124
00:07:03,828 --> 00:07:05,386
Happy birthday!

125
00:07:07,431 --> 00:07:08,955
Happy birthday!

126
00:07:09,834 --> 00:07:14,100
So I think, yeah, I think getting these
out of the way might be productive.

127
00:07:14,171 --> 00:07:15,297
Yeah.

128
00:07:15,373 --> 00:07:19,332
We can just have one big, fun party.
And everybody's happy

129
00:07:19,410 --> 00:07:20,570
and nobody
wastes their time.

130
00:07:20,645 --> 00:07:22,545
I don't like it.

131
00:07:27,051 --> 00:07:30,145
Wow. You're shaking
things up a bit, huh?

132
00:07:30,221 --> 00:07:31,882
It's a pretty good idea,
don't you think?

133
00:07:31,956 --> 00:07:36,222
Do you think it's a good idea? No.
I think it's a great idea.

134
00:07:37,628 --> 00:07:38,617
Hmm.

135
00:07:40,765 --> 00:07:42,164
We're here.

136
00:07:44,869 --> 00:07:49,897
Dwight will take my blindfold off
when we are deep in the forest.

137
00:07:49,974 --> 00:07:51,908
Just the two of us
from this point out.

138
00:07:51,976 --> 00:07:54,410
Here we go.
Just the two of us.

139
00:07:57,615 --> 00:08:00,880
Here we go into the wild,
to the mighty forest.

140
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:05,086
Can you smell the trees
and the nature?

141
00:08:06,323 --> 00:08:08,018
Keep going.
You're fine.

142
00:08:08,592 --> 00:08:10,753
Just some bushes
and some thickets.

143
00:08:13,397 --> 00:08:14,523
Keep going.

144
00:08:16,333 --> 00:08:18,563
You wanted wilderness.
You got it.

145
00:08:19,003 --> 00:08:20,493
You know, try sending
them another invoice.

146
00:08:20,571 --> 00:08:21,902
Okay.
All right.

147
00:08:22,406 --> 00:08:24,772
Oh, did you see my memo,
by the way?

148
00:08:27,511 --> 00:08:29,445
"Let's be honest,
as fun as birthdays are,

149
00:08:29,513 --> 00:08:31,378
"we all can use a break
from the constant cakes.

150
00:08:31,449 --> 00:08:34,441
"So let's celebrate birthday
month in style today."

151
00:08:35,419 --> 00:08:37,717
This is really cool.

152
00:08:38,456 --> 00:08:40,754
Right? I was
just thinking...

153
00:08:40,825 --> 00:08:42,816
No. Totally.
Totally.

154
00:08:42,893 --> 00:08:46,488
This way we get it all out of the way
at once and it could actually be fun.

155
00:08:46,564 --> 00:08:49,499
Right. Exactly.

156
00:08:50,668 --> 00:08:51,999
I knew I could
count on you.

157
00:08:54,672 --> 00:08:56,537
As good a spot as any.

158
00:09:01,746 --> 00:09:03,680
What are you doing?
Stop it.

159
00:09:03,748 --> 00:09:05,648
Dwight, just stop it.
I'm just...

160
00:09:05,716 --> 00:09:09,049
Spin. I'm trying to confuse
your sense of direction.

161
00:09:15,226 --> 00:09:16,659
Behold.

162
00:09:16,727 --> 00:09:18,354
All right, good.
Thank you, Dwight.

163
00:09:18,429 --> 00:09:20,363
Here's your knife.
Thank you.

164
00:09:20,431 --> 00:09:22,092
And here's your duct tape.
Good.

165
00:09:22,166 --> 00:09:24,361
All right.
Very good.

166
00:09:24,435 --> 00:09:27,029
Okay. Yeah.

167
00:09:27,471 --> 00:09:29,939
Good luck, Michael.
Thanks for the ride.

168
00:09:32,409 --> 00:09:33,808
Okay.

169
00:09:35,212 --> 00:09:36,839
Leave me be, Dwight.

170
00:09:39,216 --> 00:09:42,083
Hey, Jim, can I have my own cake?
What's that?

171
00:09:42,153 --> 00:09:43,745
I really prefer
Devil's F'ood Cake.

172
00:09:43,821 --> 00:09:44,981
Oh, sure.

173
00:09:45,055 --> 00:09:46,215
Yes.
Okay.

174
00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:47,382
Awesome.

175
00:09:47,758 --> 00:09:48,816
Wow.
That was easy.

176
00:09:48,893 --> 00:09:50,758
Yeah. People like me,
I guess.

177
00:09:50,828 --> 00:09:51,920
Jim.

178
00:09:52,763 --> 00:09:54,788
I hate Devil's F'ood. Well,
I think Meredith was...

179
00:09:54,865 --> 00:09:56,492
Screw Meredith.
I don't think it's fair

180
00:09:56,567 --> 00:09:58,535
to let someone else pick
the cake on my birthday.

181
00:09:58,602 --> 00:10:00,832
Everybody's birthday. Today
is actually my birthday

182
00:10:00,905 --> 00:10:02,873
and I want to pick the cake.
What do you want?

183
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:04,805
I want pie. I want peach pie.
You want birthday pie?

184
00:10:04,875 --> 00:10:05,864
I want a nice cobbler.

185
00:10:05,943 --> 00:10:08,309
I'll talk to Angela and we're going
to see what we can do about a pie.

186
00:10:08,379 --> 00:10:10,108
I don't care who you talk to.
Just make it happen.

187
00:10:10,181 --> 00:10:12,274
It'll be Angela. You
tell her it's for Creed.

188
00:10:12,349 --> 00:10:13,782
She'll know
what that means.

189
00:10:20,224 --> 00:10:24,923
Day one. I'm in the interior of
the vast Pennsylvania wilderness.

190
00:10:25,930 --> 00:10:28,797
I have brought with me
only the bare essentials,

191
00:10:28,866 --> 00:10:32,165
a knife,
a roll of duct tape

192
00:10:32,236 --> 00:10:36,605
in case I need to fashion a shelter
or make some sort of water vessel.

193
00:10:37,608 --> 00:10:43,171
It's hot today. The sun is in the
two-thirds easterly quadrant,

194
00:10:43,247 --> 00:10:48,617
which would make it about 2:00
in the afternoon.

195
00:10:48,686 --> 00:10:50,984
Really beating down
on me now.

196
00:10:51,055 --> 00:10:55,719
I think that I want to get
a little more comfortable

197
00:10:56,227 --> 00:11:00,823
because the sun is
depleting my resources.

198
00:11:00,898 --> 00:11:04,061
Okay. There we go.

199
00:11:04,134 --> 00:11:08,594
Watch that I don't hit
my carotid artery here.

200
00:11:08,672 --> 00:11:13,268
I lied to Michael. I said that I would
leave him alone, but I will not.

201
00:11:13,344 --> 00:11:17,007
I will remain close by to
provide unseen moral support.

202
00:11:17,081 --> 00:11:18,810
But I will never help him.

203
00:11:19,183 --> 00:11:23,916
I will let harm befall him.
I will even let him die.

204
00:11:23,988 --> 00:11:26,616
But I will never let him
lose his dignity.

205
00:11:27,057 --> 00:11:29,491
There we go.
Much better.

206
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:34,497
Now everything I brought
with me can be used.

207
00:11:34,565 --> 00:11:36,931
My sport coat here

208
00:11:37,001 --> 00:11:41,631
can be fashioned
into a backpack of sorts.

209
00:11:41,705 --> 00:11:47,644
I'm going to wear what was
once one of my pant legs.

210
00:11:50,481 --> 00:11:53,314
See, this is a beautiful
piece of material.

211
00:11:53,384 --> 00:11:58,287
This can be used for all sorts
of things, some sort of kerchief

212
00:11:59,857 --> 00:12:02,758
to keep my neck
nice and comfortable.

213
00:12:05,562 --> 00:12:07,553
Jimbo.
Andy.

214
00:12:07,631 --> 00:12:11,692
Me likey the ice cream cake, okay?
F'udgie the Whale.

215
00:12:11,769 --> 00:12:14,897
Not your birthday. Well,
I'm just saying, you know,

216
00:12:14,972 --> 00:12:16,997
if you want to make
people happy, namely me,

217
00:12:17,074 --> 00:12:18,871
you will have
a F'udgie the Whale.

218
00:12:18,943 --> 00:12:22,106
All right. I'll look into
it, but the answer's no.

219
00:12:22,813 --> 00:12:24,838
Well, okay. Harsh.

220
00:12:25,282 --> 00:12:26,840
Just don't expect me
to show up.

221
00:12:26,917 --> 00:12:30,318
Hey, Andy, I have some calls to make.
Loud and clear.

222
00:12:30,387 --> 00:12:31,752
All right.

223
00:12:34,725 --> 00:12:37,558
Pizza rolls. Okay, I'm going
to go into this office here

224
00:12:37,628 --> 00:12:39,220
to do some work
so I will be in here.

225
00:12:39,296 --> 00:12:40,388
Mushroom caps.

226
00:12:40,798 --> 00:12:45,258
I am totally alone right now
with only my thoughts.

227
00:12:45,336 --> 00:12:47,896
I love it. I'm loving it.

228
00:12:49,239 --> 00:12:53,903
I can literally say anything I want.
No one is going to hear me.

229
00:12:54,845 --> 00:12:58,212
Wish I could have gone with
Ryan on that cool retreat.

230
00:12:59,149 --> 00:13:01,174
Jan has plastic boobs.

231
00:13:02,052 --> 00:13:06,113
I have hemorrhoids.

232
00:13:08,993 --> 00:13:10,927
Doesn't even matter.

233
00:13:10,995 --> 00:13:13,930
Michael's a man of great
depth and passion.

234
00:13:15,532 --> 00:13:18,524
I don't know what he's
searching for out here.

235
00:13:23,073 --> 00:13:24,700
But I hope he finds it.

236
00:13:27,878 --> 00:13:29,072
Lunch.

237
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:33,648
Well. It is a little chillier
than I had thought.

238
00:13:33,717 --> 00:13:36,345
So I have fashioned my hat
back into my pants.

239
00:13:37,621 --> 00:13:40,818
Several hours in, it's time for
me to find some nourishment.

240
00:13:40,891 --> 00:13:45,055
Now these woods are full of creatures
that can sustain human life.

241
00:13:45,129 --> 00:13:48,428
Things like squirrels,

242
00:13:48,499 --> 00:13:51,662
a nice, juicy rabbit
would be delicious.

243
00:13:53,637 --> 00:13:55,537
About two more minutes.

244
00:13:57,508 --> 00:14:03,208
I have made this spear with
which I will impale my dinner.

245
00:14:05,549 --> 00:14:07,016
And that couldn't come
a moment too soon,

246
00:14:07,084 --> 00:14:10,576
because I have been
without food for a good

247
00:14:11,255 --> 00:14:12,950
three hours or so.

248
00:14:13,991 --> 00:14:16,391
Starting to feel it
a little bit.

249
00:14:21,331 --> 00:14:23,162
It's Creed's birthday today.

250
00:14:24,268 --> 00:14:27,897
Happy birthday to you

251
00:14:28,772 --> 00:14:32,902
Happy birthday to you

252
00:14:32,976 --> 00:14:38,505
Happy birthday, dear Creed

253
00:14:39,183 --> 00:14:45,884
Happy birthday to you

254
00:14:46,957 --> 00:14:48,822
Happy birthday, buddy.

255
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:53,823
What is Jim thinking? It's a birthday.
So what if there's a lot of them?

256
00:14:53,897 --> 00:14:59,767
Yeah. I work hard all day. I like knowing
that there's going to be a break.

257
00:14:59,837 --> 00:15:02,465
Most days I just sit
and wait for the break.

258
00:15:02,539 --> 00:15:06,270
I took an extra shot of insulin in
preparation for this cake today.

259
00:15:06,343 --> 00:15:08,868
If I don't have some
cake soon, I might die.

260
00:15:08,946 --> 00:15:10,072
Why don't you just
have an apple?

261
00:15:10,147 --> 00:15:11,580
Why don't you
mind your business?

262
00:15:11,648 --> 00:15:12,945
Listen,
I figured this out.

263
00:15:13,016 --> 00:15:16,884
Jimmy had his birthday three
weeks ago so he doesn't care.

264
00:15:16,954 --> 00:15:18,819
I think the power went to his head.
Yeah.

265
00:15:18,889 --> 00:15:20,447
Hey, Jim.
Hey, guys.

266
00:15:20,524 --> 00:15:24,187
What are we talking about?
Nothing. Nothing going on.

267
00:15:24,261 --> 00:15:27,697
We're talking about nothing.
Come on, gang.

268
00:15:32,736 --> 00:15:36,172
Well, if you take a look at
this, I tented my pants.

269
00:15:36,974 --> 00:15:41,070
I've made myself
a nice pants tent shelter.

270
00:15:41,845 --> 00:15:44,678
And this little guy may be
Dunder Mifflin paper some day.

271
00:15:50,554 --> 00:15:53,114
Nothing to worry about.
Just using the scope.

272
00:15:53,190 --> 00:15:56,648
Safety is on.

273
00:16:00,664 --> 00:16:01,653
Hey, Jim.

274
00:16:01,732 --> 00:16:02,824
Toby.

275
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:05,664
Hey, I just got the word
on the communal birthdays.

276
00:16:05,736 --> 00:16:07,727
Oh.
Great idea.

277
00:16:09,106 --> 00:16:11,040
Oh, thanks, man.
Yeah.

278
00:16:15,179 --> 00:16:16,510
Is there anything
I can...

279
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:18,377
My birthday
was two months ago.

280
00:16:18,448 --> 00:16:19,437
Oh, okay.

281
00:16:19,516 --> 00:16:21,177
There was no party.

282
00:16:21,251 --> 00:16:25,483
What? Well, there was but
Michael scheduled it for

283
00:16:25,556 --> 00:16:29,048
4:58 on a F'riday. People
sang in the parking lot.

284
00:16:29,126 --> 00:16:30,150
I remember that.

285
00:16:30,227 --> 00:16:31,558
I don't know, I just
thought maybe you

286
00:16:31,628 --> 00:16:34,119
could include me.
Seriously?

287
00:16:34,198 --> 00:16:37,326
I just thought you could add me in. I
don't know what the harm in that is.

288
00:16:37,668 --> 00:16:41,934
Toby's great. He's great. But sometimes
he can be a little bit much.

289
00:16:42,005 --> 00:16:47,033
"I don't see the harm in that." Well,
it's a cake, Toby, so come on.

290
00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:49,203
Okay, yeah, you know what, we're
just going to throw you in

291
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:50,405
because the more,
the merrier, right?

292
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:54,246
No. No way.
I am not a machine, Jim.

293
00:16:54,318 --> 00:16:58,220
You can't just change plans willy-nilly
and expect these little magic party elves

294
00:16:58,288 --> 00:17:00,415
to do your bidding.
We already have Devil's F'ood,

295
00:17:00,490 --> 00:17:03,618
peach cobbler, F'udgie the
Whale, mushroom caps...

296
00:17:03,694 --> 00:17:05,093
I'm allergic to mushrooms.

297
00:17:05,162 --> 00:17:07,357
That's a bummer. Okay.

298
00:17:07,431 --> 00:17:09,865
Then we need to...

299
00:17:09,933 --> 00:17:12,834
Hey, everybody. Hi, how are you doing?
Could I have your attention, please?

300
00:17:12,903 --> 00:17:15,030
'Cause we have to talk
about this birthday thing.

301
00:17:15,105 --> 00:17:17,335
Conference room? Yes. Conference room.
F'ive minutes.

302
00:17:17,407 --> 00:17:21,503
No. No. We're going
to solve it right here.

303
00:17:21,578 --> 00:17:23,478
We're going to actually
talk about it out here.

304
00:17:23,547 --> 00:17:26,914
So who has problems
with the birthday thing?

305
00:17:26,984 --> 00:17:30,852
One, two, three, everybody. Okay,
so then we just shouldn't do it.

306
00:17:30,921 --> 00:17:33,412
What am I supposed to do
with two cakes and a pie?

307
00:17:33,490 --> 00:17:36,220
I'll take them. Well,
nobody's touching my cobbler.

308
00:17:36,293 --> 00:17:38,284
Hey, Michael.
I mean Jim.

309
00:17:39,763 --> 00:17:42,493
Yeah. Phyllis
called me Michael.

310
00:17:43,834 --> 00:17:46,701
And I will always and forever
be haunted by that fact.

311
00:17:47,337 --> 00:17:51,569
Under this tree, I think I
struck the mother lode.

312
00:17:51,642 --> 00:17:56,875
Those are nature's
best mushrooms.

313
00:17:56,947 --> 00:18:01,884
Wild, and I have to say, these little
buggers are damn tasty as well.

314
00:18:01,952 --> 00:18:04,420
Stop. No. No, Michael.

315
00:18:04,488 --> 00:18:08,015
No. No. No.

316
00:18:11,628 --> 00:18:12,959
Get them out.

317
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:20,828
Happy birthday to you

318
00:18:20,904 --> 00:18:25,136
Happy birthday to you

319
00:18:25,208 --> 00:18:30,669
Happy birthday,
dear Creed

320
00:18:30,747 --> 00:18:36,208
Happy birthday to you

321
00:18:36,286 --> 00:18:38,686
Yeah. All right.

322
00:18:38,755 --> 00:18:42,521
Skip around the room. Skip
around the room. We won't...

323
00:18:42,592 --> 00:18:46,084
Okay, all right, yikes. Don't do that.
You're going to break something.

324
00:18:46,296 --> 00:18:51,825
Man became civilized for a reason. He
decided that he liked to have warmth

325
00:18:51,902 --> 00:18:54,336
and clothing
and television,

326
00:18:54,604 --> 00:18:57,539
and hamburgers,
and to walk upright,

327
00:18:57,607 --> 00:19:01,043
and to have a soft futon
at the end of the day.

328
00:19:01,111 --> 00:19:03,739
He didn't want to have
to struggle to survive.

329
00:19:03,947 --> 00:19:08,111
I don't need the woods.
I have a nice wood desk.

330
00:19:09,286 --> 00:19:11,481
I don't need fresh air

331
00:19:11,555 --> 00:19:14,922
because I have the
freshest air around, AC.

332
00:19:16,426 --> 00:19:18,860
And I don't need
wide open spaces.

333
00:19:20,430 --> 00:19:21,658
Check it out.

334
00:19:24,868 --> 00:19:26,927
I can also
make it the sky.

335
00:19:30,707 --> 00:19:32,334
Hi, buddy.
Hey.

336
00:19:32,409 --> 00:19:33,501
What's up?

337
00:19:34,077 --> 00:19:36,170
I'm sure glad
you're back.

338
00:19:36,346 --> 00:19:37,813
You are relieved.

339
00:19:37,881 --> 00:19:39,280
You have no idea.

340
00:19:40,450 --> 00:19:42,145
So what did I miss?

341
00:19:42,252 --> 00:19:44,584
Well, I tried to put all the
birthdays together at once.

342
00:19:44,654 --> 00:19:46,383
Oh.
So, terrible idea.

343
00:19:46,456 --> 00:19:50,483
Yeah. Okay, I did that.
Rookie mistake.

344
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:54,155
You did do it?
Yeah. Just wait.

345
00:19:54,231 --> 00:19:56,563
Ten years,
you'll figure it out.

346
00:19:56,633 --> 00:19:59,602
Well, I don't think I'll be
here in ten years, but...

347
00:20:00,704 --> 00:20:02,194
That's what I said.

348
00:20:06,877 --> 00:20:08,401
That's what
she said.

349
00:20:11,782 --> 00:20:13,215
That's what who said?

350
00:20:13,283 --> 00:20:14,910
I never know.

351
00:20:15,685 --> 00:20:19,815
But I just say it. I say
stuff like that, you know,

352
00:20:20,791 --> 00:20:23,954
to lighten the tension when
things sort of get hard.

353
00:20:24,027 --> 00:20:25,892
That's what she said.

354
00:20:25,962 --> 00:20:28,556
Hey. Nice.

355
00:20:29,766 --> 00:20:30,926
Really good.

356
00:20:33,470 --> 00:20:36,337
Bravo, my young ward.
