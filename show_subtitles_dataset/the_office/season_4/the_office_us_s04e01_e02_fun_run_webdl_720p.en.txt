1
00:00:04,297 --> 00:00:08,734
Okay, well, I did not get
the job in New York,

2
00:00:09,568 --> 00:00:12,366
but I got the real prize,
domestic bliss.

3
00:00:13,639 --> 00:00:15,869
Jan made me breakfast
this morning.

4
00:00:16,909 --> 00:00:18,843
Well, she bought the milk.

5
00:00:20,146 --> 00:00:21,408
It's soy.

6
00:00:22,481 --> 00:00:24,346
This is why I do it.

7
00:00:25,484 --> 00:00:27,975
That's what I have
to come home to.

8
00:00:32,258 --> 00:00:34,818
She probably won't
be up for a few hours.

9
00:00:35,094 --> 00:00:38,689
This is going to be a very good year.
Very good.

10
00:00:39,065 --> 00:00:45,436
Jan is at home. Jim is back. My protégé
Ryan is at corporate. Good stuff.

11
00:00:46,439 --> 00:00:50,876
Andy and Dwight are rocking the sales team.
I feel very blessed.

12
00:01:33,285 --> 00:01:36,049
You know, generally it's not a good
idea to click on any Internet offers

13
00:01:36,122 --> 00:01:39,250
that you haven't requested.
What was the exact offer?

14
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:41,886
It was for a video.

15
00:01:41,961 --> 00:01:43,360
Yeah. What kind of video?

16
00:01:44,363 --> 00:01:46,456
A celebrity sex tape.

17
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:50,325
Really?
What kind of celebrity?

18
00:01:50,569 --> 00:01:52,332
It's not relevant.
How much did you pay for it?

19
00:01:52,405 --> 00:01:53,736
Not relevant.
You paid for it?

20
00:01:53,806 --> 00:01:55,637
It all happened
so fast.

21
00:01:55,708 --> 00:01:58,438
I broke up with Karen
after the job interview.

22
00:01:58,944 --> 00:02:01,139
And it was

23
00:02:01,213 --> 00:02:03,807
a little awkward when she
came back from the city.

24
00:02:03,883 --> 00:02:06,477
She told me very clearly that
just because we were broken up

25
00:02:06,552 --> 00:02:08,213
didn't mean that
she was going anywhere,

26
00:02:08,287 --> 00:02:11,051
because she had worked
really hard for her career,

27
00:02:11,123 --> 00:02:13,523
but the next day
her desk was empty.

28
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:17,991
And as for me and my
current romantic life...

29
00:02:18,731 --> 00:02:21,825
I am single now
and looking.

30
00:02:23,102 --> 00:02:25,093
So, if you
know anybody...

31
00:02:25,771 --> 00:02:29,036
Jim and I went to dinner a few times
when he got back from New York.

32
00:02:29,108 --> 00:02:31,201
I talked him
through his breakup.

33
00:02:31,944 --> 00:02:34,435
It's really nice to
be good friends again.

34
00:02:35,214 --> 00:02:40,208
Are you kidding me? Pam and
Jim are totally hooking up.

35
00:02:40,586 --> 00:02:42,178
All they do is smile.

36
00:02:42,254 --> 00:02:45,155
They're just keeping it
a secret. Right?

37
00:02:45,224 --> 00:02:48,625
I don't know. There is
no evidence of intimacy.

38
00:02:48,694 --> 00:02:50,628
They've been in
remarkably good moods.

39
00:02:50,696 --> 00:02:51,754
It could be
other things.

40
00:02:51,831 --> 00:02:53,696
Are you kidding me?

41
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:57,897
And Sunday, I'm thinking of going to
that flea market at the drive-in.

42
00:02:57,970 --> 00:03:02,373
That sounds fun. I'm mountain biking
on Sunday on Montage Mountain.

43
00:03:02,441 --> 00:03:03,465
Cool.
Yeah.

44
00:03:03,542 --> 00:03:04,941
Well,
have fun with that.

45
00:03:12,284 --> 00:03:13,979
Ladies and gentlemen,

46
00:03:15,354 --> 00:03:16,878
I have some bad news.

47
00:03:17,756 --> 00:03:19,280
Meredith was
hit by a car.

48
00:03:19,358 --> 00:03:21,087
What? Where?
Oh, my God.

49
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:23,219
It happened this morning
in the parking lot.

50
00:03:23,295 --> 00:03:28,130
I took her to the hospital and the
doctors tried to save her life.

51
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:30,293
They did the best
that they could

52
00:03:31,103 --> 00:03:33,230
and she is
going to be okay.

53
00:03:33,305 --> 00:03:37,401
What is wrong with you? Why did
you have to phrase it like that?

54
00:03:37,476 --> 00:03:38,909
So she's really
going to be fine?

55
00:03:38,978 --> 00:03:43,779
Yes. She has a slight
pelvical fracture,

56
00:03:43,849 --> 00:03:46,215
but people have
survived far worse.

57
00:03:46,986 --> 00:03:48,977
Thank God
you were there.

58
00:03:49,822 --> 00:03:51,050
Yeah.

59
00:03:51,123 --> 00:03:52,750
Did you see
who did it?

60
00:03:53,058 --> 00:03:55,026
Oh, no need. We can just
check the security tapes.

61
00:03:55,094 --> 00:03:56,994
Yeah. Kind of a
good-news-bad-news there.

62
00:03:57,062 --> 00:04:01,829
I was able to be on the scene so quickly
because I was in the car that hit her.

63
00:04:04,803 --> 00:04:06,293
Who was driving?

64
00:04:10,109 --> 00:04:11,576
Oh, Michael.

65
00:04:12,044 --> 00:04:15,810
One day Michael came in complaining
about a speed bump on the highway.

66
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:20,211
I wonder who
he ran over then.

67
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,144
It's only Meredith.

68
00:04:22,221 --> 00:04:25,918
Yeah. It's only Meredith.
Thank God.

69
00:04:25,991 --> 00:04:27,982
But did you see the way
they looked at me?

70
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:30,221
Like I was a murderer
or something.

71
00:04:30,296 --> 00:04:31,695
Hey...

72
00:04:33,465 --> 00:04:34,523
Why did you do it?

73
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,794
It was an accident.

74
00:04:35,868 --> 00:04:37,096
Was she
talking back?

75
00:04:37,169 --> 00:04:38,227
No.

76
00:04:38,304 --> 00:04:40,932
Just got sick of that face?
Did she owe you money?

77
00:04:42,241 --> 00:04:44,072
Is this downsizing?

78
00:04:44,143 --> 00:04:45,906
Did she spurn
your advances?

79
00:04:48,314 --> 00:04:51,112
Hey, guys. We're all going
to visit Meredith at lunch

80
00:04:51,183 --> 00:04:53,242
and we're kicking
in $5 for flowers.

81
00:04:53,319 --> 00:04:55,184
Who's "we,"
you and Jim?

82
00:04:55,421 --> 00:04:57,719
No. Me and Stanley
and Phyllis, so far.

83
00:04:58,290 --> 00:05:00,417
Oh, I bet
Jim goes, too.

84
00:05:01,627 --> 00:05:02,855
Yeah, I haven't
asked him yet.

85
00:05:02,928 --> 00:05:04,520
Oh, I bet you ask.

86
00:05:04,597 --> 00:05:05,757
I was planning on it.

87
00:05:06,699 --> 00:05:08,166
I bet you were.

88
00:05:09,568 --> 00:05:10,626
Subtle.

89
00:05:10,703 --> 00:05:11,897
What?
Are you coming?

90
00:05:11,971 --> 00:05:14,098
I can't.
Sprinkles is sick.

91
00:05:14,173 --> 00:05:15,697
She's been sick
for some time.

92
00:05:15,774 --> 00:05:19,608
Thank you for asking.
No one asks about Sprinkles.

93
00:05:21,213 --> 00:05:23,681
I have to give her her meds.
I have to pet her.

94
00:05:23,749 --> 00:05:25,512
And who will she
eat lunch with?

95
00:05:25,584 --> 00:05:27,449
Can't your other cats
keep her company?

96
00:05:27,519 --> 00:05:30,511
There's bad blood,
jealousies, cliques...

97
00:05:30,589 --> 00:05:33,683
Angela, you're the chairman of
the Party Planning Committee.

98
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:36,922
I shouldn't even be planning this.
It's your job.

99
00:05:38,297 --> 00:05:39,628
All right.

100
00:05:41,033 --> 00:05:43,126
- My lord, my liege!
- Yes, Michael?

101
00:05:43,202 --> 00:05:45,102
So Ryan got
promoted to corporate

102
00:05:45,170 --> 00:05:47,866
where he is a little fish
in a big pond.

103
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:50,101
Whereas,
back here in Scranton,

104
00:05:50,175 --> 00:05:51,836
I am still top dog

105
00:05:52,778 --> 00:05:56,236
in a fairly large pond.

106
00:05:57,549 --> 00:06:00,347
So, who is the real boss,

107
00:06:02,288 --> 00:06:04,552
the dog or a fish?

108
00:06:05,557 --> 00:06:08,048
So I need a little
treat for the gang,

109
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:10,220
something to win
their affections back.

110
00:06:10,296 --> 00:06:12,662
Back?
Why is that, Michael?

111
00:06:13,098 --> 00:06:15,658
Well, I ran down
Meredith in my car.

112
00:06:15,734 --> 00:06:17,929
Oh! Did you do
this on purpose?

113
00:06:18,003 --> 00:06:21,939
No, I was being negligent, but
she's in the hospital, she's fine.

114
00:06:22,007 --> 00:06:24,874
Recovering nicely, tiny
little crack in her pelvis,

115
00:06:25,044 --> 00:06:27,137
but she will be up and... Did
this happen on company property?

116
00:06:27,212 --> 00:06:32,878
Yes. It was on company property with
company property, so double jeopardy.

117
00:06:32,951 --> 00:06:33,940
We are fine.

118
00:06:34,019 --> 00:06:35,953
I don't think
you understand

119
00:06:36,021 --> 00:06:37,784
how jeopardy works.

120
00:06:37,856 --> 00:06:41,155
Oh, right. I'm sorry.
What is "We're fine"?

121
00:06:43,595 --> 00:06:47,656
People keep calling me a "wunderkind."
I don't even know what that means.

122
00:06:47,766 --> 00:06:51,634
I mean, I know what it means. It
means very successful for your age.

123
00:06:51,704 --> 00:06:55,037
So I guess it makes sense,
but it's a weird word.

124
00:06:56,475 --> 00:06:58,568
Hey, D. Hey, monkey, what's up?

125
00:06:58,644 --> 00:06:59,872
Can you do me
a little favor?

126
00:06:59,945 --> 00:07:02,106
Go to my place at lunch and
give Sprinkles her medicine?

127
00:07:02,181 --> 00:07:03,273
Sure.

128
00:07:03,349 --> 00:07:04,441
I have to
visit the alkie.

129
00:07:05,117 --> 00:07:06,516
Check to see
if she's faking.

130
00:07:07,353 --> 00:07:09,821
If a car hit me, it
wouldn't crack my pelvis.

131
00:07:09,888 --> 00:07:12,356
You know what? I bet she
cracked it at home,

132
00:07:12,424 --> 00:07:15,086
jumped in front of the car
to get some worker's comp.

133
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,957
I wouldn't
put it past her.

134
00:07:19,031 --> 00:07:20,328
So what do you
need me to do?

135
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:22,799
I wrote it out.
There's a diabetes shot.

136
00:07:22,868 --> 00:07:25,302
Roll the insulin in your hands.
Don't shake it.

137
00:07:25,371 --> 00:07:28,670
She gets an ACE inhibitor with her meal. You
have to put her right in front of the dish

138
00:07:28,741 --> 00:07:31,073
or she won't see it
because of the cataracts.

139
00:07:31,143 --> 00:07:35,102
Mix one capsule of omega fatty
acid in with her kidney medicine.

140
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:39,480
And you want to give that to her
15 minutes after she's eaten.

141
00:07:39,551 --> 00:07:41,416
And... Oh,
there's a fungal cream

142
00:07:41,487 --> 00:07:43,114
because she has this
infection under her tail,

143
00:07:43,188 --> 00:07:44,712
so you're going to
have to lift her tail

144
00:07:44,790 --> 00:07:46,883
and put the cream right
at the base of her tail.

145
00:07:47,493 --> 00:07:49,927
Okay, I have
an announcement.

146
00:07:49,995 --> 00:07:51,519
You pushed Darryl out the window?
No.

147
00:07:51,597 --> 00:07:53,895
You shot Dwight? No. No.
That is not funny.

148
00:07:53,966 --> 00:07:57,868
I love my employees even though
I hit one of you with my car,

149
00:07:58,537 --> 00:08:01,199
for which I take
full responsibility.

150
00:08:01,273 --> 00:08:06,142
Look, I'm just trying to take everybody's
mind off of this unavoidable tragedy

151
00:08:06,211 --> 00:08:08,907
and on to more
positive things,

152
00:08:08,981 --> 00:08:12,246
so I thought we
should plant a tree.

153
00:08:12,951 --> 00:08:14,748
Oh, good. At least we
don't have to work.

154
00:08:14,853 --> 00:08:16,616
Okay, we're leaving for
the hospital at 1:00.

155
00:08:16,688 --> 00:08:18,417
So, like,
a freedom tree.

156
00:08:18,490 --> 00:08:19,457
I can take
three people.

157
00:08:19,525 --> 00:08:20,685
I can also take
three people.

158
00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:21,783
Separate cars.

159
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:23,623
Pam? All right, we'll get
a card at the hospital

160
00:08:23,695 --> 00:08:24,957
and we'll sign it
outside her room.

161
00:08:25,030 --> 00:08:27,260
Pam? Sales people can
go later in the day.

162
00:08:27,332 --> 00:08:28,526
Hourly workers
can go at lunch.

163
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:31,797
Okay, good, good, so we'll just all
go down there together at lunch.

164
00:08:31,870 --> 00:08:33,167
Excellent. I was
thinking that we...

165
00:08:33,238 --> 00:08:34,535
Good work, Pam.
But if we...

166
00:08:34,606 --> 00:08:36,233
Yay! I think it
would be a lot...

167
00:08:36,308 --> 00:08:37,400
Pam!

168
00:08:37,943 --> 00:08:40,468
All right, since I am the
boss, I will drive as well.

169
00:08:40,546 --> 00:08:42,537
Who wants shotgun?
You can't be serious.

170
00:08:42,614 --> 00:08:44,104
You ran a woman
over this morning.

171
00:08:44,183 --> 00:08:47,880
Everyone inside the car
was fine, Stanley!

172
00:08:48,887 --> 00:08:52,152
Guess what? I have flaws.
What are they?

173
00:08:52,224 --> 00:08:54,590
Oh, I don't know.
I sing in the shower.

174
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,885
Sometimes, I spend too
much time volunteering.

175
00:08:57,963 --> 00:09:01,694
Occasionally, I'll hit somebody
with my car. So sue me.

176
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:06,901
No, don't sue me. That's the opposite
of the point that I'm trying to make.

177
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:20,113
I hate hospitals. In my mind, they
are associated with sickness.

178
00:09:23,322 --> 00:09:25,017
She looks
like an angel.

179
00:09:25,090 --> 00:09:26,489
She looks awful.

180
00:09:26,558 --> 00:09:29,584
No? Okay, she always looks like that.
It was not my fault.

181
00:09:29,661 --> 00:09:31,390
I think she's awake.

182
00:09:31,463 --> 00:09:33,795
No, she's in a coma.

183
00:09:36,268 --> 00:09:37,326
No.

184
00:09:39,037 --> 00:09:42,404
Okay. Meredith?

185
00:09:46,245 --> 00:09:48,736
I brought all your friends
from the office, dear.

186
00:09:48,814 --> 00:09:50,509
At the same time.
Yeah.

187
00:09:50,582 --> 00:09:51,571
Hello, Meredith.

188
00:09:51,650 --> 00:09:52,674
This is weird.

189
00:09:52,751 --> 00:09:54,548
Brought you
some balloons.

190
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:56,645
Why don't we...
Here you go.

191
00:09:57,856 --> 00:10:01,189
Tie these up. Cheer up your tubes.
Oh, shoot.

192
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:02,989
Oh,
for God's sake.

193
00:10:03,061 --> 00:10:04,323
Nurse!

194
00:10:04,396 --> 00:10:07,126
No, don't bother the nurse.
Just put it back in.

195
00:10:08,166 --> 00:10:11,067
I'm going to be sick.
I'm going to puke.

196
00:10:11,136 --> 00:10:13,331
I'm going to puke. I wouldn't
worry about it. Don't touch it.

197
00:10:13,405 --> 00:10:16,272
What... What are you doing?
Just give me that.

198
00:10:19,278 --> 00:10:20,336
Thanks.

199
00:10:22,514 --> 00:10:24,004
Does it
hurt terribly?

200
00:10:24,082 --> 00:10:25,447
No. It's not too bad.

201
00:10:25,517 --> 00:10:26,745
They have me on
a lot of painkillers.

202
00:10:26,818 --> 00:10:28,149
Oh, really?
What kind?

203
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:33,556
Codeine? Vicodin? Percocet? F'entanyl?
OxyContin? Palladone?

204
00:10:33,625 --> 00:10:34,956
What?
I have no idea.

205
00:10:37,963 --> 00:10:42,730
Well, it was really great of all of you
to come and visit me at the same time.

206
00:10:42,801 --> 00:10:43,893
I'll see you guys
at the office.

207
00:10:43,969 --> 00:10:45,129
Okay.

208
00:10:45,203 --> 00:10:48,366
Okay. Wait up. Wait up. Guys, guys, guys.
Hold on a sec.

209
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:51,307
You know what I was thinking
might be sort of fun,

210
00:10:51,376 --> 00:10:54,743
is if you forgave me
in front of everybody.

211
00:10:54,813 --> 00:10:56,337
Michael,
I'm not going to do that.

212
00:10:56,415 --> 00:11:00,078
'Cause you know what they say
in the Bible about forgiveness?

213
00:11:00,686 --> 00:11:04,417
F'orgiveness is
next to godliness.

214
00:11:04,890 --> 00:11:07,154
No, that's not what they...
Well, just... Just...

215
00:11:07,225 --> 00:11:08,453
You cracked my pelvis.

216
00:11:08,527 --> 00:11:10,722
Look, I just...
I don't understand

217
00:11:10,796 --> 00:11:12,787
what is preventing you
from laughing this off

218
00:11:12,864 --> 00:11:14,126
and giving me a big hug.

219
00:11:14,199 --> 00:11:15,826
You are not forgiven.

220
00:11:15,901 --> 00:11:17,027
Come on.

221
00:11:17,703 --> 00:11:19,261
Michael! Michael!

222
00:11:19,338 --> 00:11:20,771
Michael!

223
00:11:20,839 --> 00:11:25,276
Do I need to be liked? Absolutely not.
I like to be liked.

224
00:11:25,344 --> 00:11:28,677
I enjoy being liked.
I have to be liked,

225
00:11:29,181 --> 00:11:34,585
but it's not like this
compulsive need to be liked,

226
00:11:34,853 --> 00:11:37,378
like my need
to be praised.

227
00:11:41,226 --> 00:11:42,215
Hey.

228
00:11:42,294 --> 00:11:43,727
Hey, monkey.

229
00:11:43,929 --> 00:11:45,226
Any problems?

230
00:11:45,297 --> 00:11:48,095
Well, you left the TV on,
and your cat is dead.

231
00:11:49,434 --> 00:11:51,334
What? Sparkles, the
white one, is dead.

232
00:11:51,403 --> 00:11:52,529
Sprinkles.

233
00:11:53,271 --> 00:11:55,296
That was the sick one, right?

234
00:11:59,544 --> 00:12:01,375
I thought
she had more time.

235
00:12:01,446 --> 00:12:02,879
No.

236
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:07,443
Did she look...

237
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,254
When you saw her,
how was she looking?

238
00:12:10,322 --> 00:12:11,721
Really dead.

239
00:12:12,357 --> 00:12:14,188
Like,
just a dead cat.

240
00:12:15,293 --> 00:12:18,820
So... Hey, come on,
don't be sad.

241
00:12:18,897 --> 00:12:21,297
Just... Okay?
Just...

242
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:23,089
She's in
a better place.

243
00:12:23,168 --> 00:12:24,328
All right.

244
00:12:25,404 --> 00:12:30,603
Actually, the place that she's in
is the freezer because of the odor.

245
00:12:35,981 --> 00:12:37,141
It's going
to be okay.

246
00:12:37,215 --> 00:12:38,807
Okay, you know what?

247
00:12:38,884 --> 00:12:41,944
Everybody, let's just get over
the whole Meredith thing.

248
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:46,116
She cracked her pelvis, a tiny little
crack, and she's going to be fine.

249
00:12:46,191 --> 00:12:47,180
So, let's just...

250
00:12:47,259 --> 00:12:48,920
Michael,
Angela's cat died.

251
00:12:50,529 --> 00:12:51,791
Sprinkles?

252
00:13:00,739 --> 00:13:02,297
Oh, shoot.

253
00:13:03,442 --> 00:13:06,809
I'm sorry, Angela.
Man, what a day, huh?

254
00:13:08,146 --> 00:13:09,704
How could it
get any worse?

255
00:13:09,781 --> 00:13:11,772
The computer crashes
with the porn,

256
00:13:11,850 --> 00:13:14,546
and then Meredith with the
accident, and then...

257
00:13:15,153 --> 00:13:17,451
Prinkles! God...

258
00:13:18,623 --> 00:13:19,851
That's three things.

259
00:13:19,925 --> 00:13:23,361
I'll tell you what's going on.
This office is cursed.

260
00:13:26,398 --> 00:13:28,127
And we need to do
something about it.

261
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:31,727
Well, I am taking responsibility,
and it is up to me

262
00:13:31,803 --> 00:13:36,433
to get rid of the curse
that hit Meredith with my car.

263
00:13:37,576 --> 00:13:41,876
I'm not superstitious,
but I am a little stitious.

264
00:13:44,816 --> 00:13:48,013
Did anyone do anything involving
an Indian burial ground?

265
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:51,118
Like what?
Like park on it.

266
00:13:51,189 --> 00:13:52,781
Or dig up a body.

267
00:13:54,493 --> 00:13:57,189
Toby, do you have anything
you want to tell us?

268
00:13:57,462 --> 00:14:01,831
No. I did not violate
an Indian burial ground.

269
00:14:02,134 --> 00:14:05,126
In fact, I had some good luck recently.
Alfredo's Pizza picked

270
00:14:05,203 --> 00:14:08,969
my business card out of the basket.
So, I get a week of free pies.

271
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:10,337
That's cool.
Yeah.

272
00:14:10,408 --> 00:14:13,673
Perfect. So our tragedy
is your good luck.

273
00:14:15,413 --> 00:14:16,675
Satan.

274
00:14:16,748 --> 00:14:18,841
Sprinkles never
hurt a soul.

275
00:14:18,917 --> 00:14:22,080
God, in your infinite wisdom,
how can you do this?

276
00:14:22,154 --> 00:14:25,248
She wasn't ready. She had
so much left to accomplish.

277
00:14:25,323 --> 00:14:27,291
It is only a cat.

278
00:14:27,359 --> 00:14:30,157
You never...
You don't like them.

279
00:14:31,096 --> 00:14:33,326
Cats do not provide
milk or wool or meat.

280
00:14:33,398 --> 00:14:34,524
Dwight.

281
00:14:34,599 --> 00:14:36,123
Dwight, you haven't seen
Meredith yet, have you?

282
00:14:36,201 --> 00:14:37,225
No, I have not.
Well,

283
00:14:37,302 --> 00:14:40,430
I think you should go to the
hospital and pay your respects.

284
00:14:40,839 --> 00:14:43,034
I do not respect her,
but I will go.

285
00:14:44,576 --> 00:14:45,873
All right,

286
00:14:45,944 --> 00:14:51,246
I would now like to talk about each
of your individual religious beliefs.

287
00:14:52,150 --> 00:14:54,516
Michael, you can't ask
about religious beliefs.

288
00:14:54,586 --> 00:14:57,077
Satan is
a master of lies.

289
00:14:57,155 --> 00:14:59,817
Everything he says
is the opposite.

290
00:14:59,891 --> 00:15:02,519
All right, well, then you can
ask about religious beliefs.

291
00:15:02,594 --> 00:15:04,721
Thank you for the permission.
Psych.

292
00:15:04,796 --> 00:15:08,391
All right, let's just go around the
room and tell me what you believe in.

293
00:15:08,466 --> 00:15:10,434
I'm a Catholic.

294
00:15:10,502 --> 00:15:12,265
Okay.
Presbyterian.

295
00:15:12,337 --> 00:15:13,463
All right.
Me, too.

296
00:15:13,538 --> 00:15:14,630
F'or real?
Same religion.

297
00:15:14,706 --> 00:15:16,970
All right.

298
00:15:17,042 --> 00:15:19,442
I'm a Lutheran and
Bob is a Unitarian.

299
00:15:19,511 --> 00:15:20,910
It keeps things spicy.

300
00:15:20,979 --> 00:15:22,674
That's why
we're cursed.

301
00:15:23,048 --> 00:15:26,745
I've been involved in a number of
cults, both as a leader and a follower.

302
00:15:26,818 --> 00:15:28,513
You have more fun
as a follower.

303
00:15:28,587 --> 00:15:30,555
But you make more
money as a leader.

304
00:15:31,022 --> 00:15:34,116
Kelly, you are Hindu,
so you believe in Buddha.

305
00:15:34,192 --> 00:15:35,921
That's Buddhists.

306
00:15:35,994 --> 00:15:38,121
Are you sure?
No.

307
00:15:39,397 --> 00:15:40,659
What are you?

308
00:15:40,732 --> 00:15:45,192
Well, if you're going to reduce my
identity to my religion, then I'm Sikh.

309
00:15:45,270 --> 00:15:47,704
But I also like
hip-hop and NPR,

310
00:15:47,772 --> 00:15:51,071
and I'm restoring a 1967
Corvette in my spare time.

311
00:15:51,142 --> 00:15:55,545
Okay. So one Sikh and...

312
00:15:56,781 --> 00:15:59,716
As a farmer, I know that
when an animal is sick,

313
00:15:59,784 --> 00:16:03,311
sometimes the right thing to do
is to put it out of its misery.

314
00:16:03,855 --> 00:16:06,323
With the electricity we're
using to keep Meredith alive,

315
00:16:06,391 --> 00:16:09,451
we could power a small
fan for two days.

316
00:16:09,527 --> 00:16:11,552
You tell me
what's unethical.

317
00:16:11,630 --> 00:16:14,394
Blink once if you want
me to pull the plug.

318
00:16:15,133 --> 00:16:17,192
Don't pull any plugs. All right.

319
00:16:17,269 --> 00:16:19,396
How are you doing, Ms.
Palmer? Better.

320
00:16:19,471 --> 00:16:22,065
Excellent. Are you a
doctor or a male nurse?

321
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:23,801
I'm an intern, which
makes me a doctor.

322
00:16:25,510 --> 00:16:28,479
Her chart doesn't indicate
that she had a hysterectomy.

323
00:16:28,546 --> 00:16:31,344
But she did, or at least
she got time off for one.

324
00:16:32,350 --> 00:16:35,046
So that is where
her uterus went.

325
00:16:36,521 --> 00:16:37,715
Ms. Palmer,
your last tetanus shot

326
00:16:37,789 --> 00:16:39,654
was when you were bitten
by a bat a few months ago?

327
00:16:39,724 --> 00:16:43,455
Yes. Dwight, here, trapped
it in a bag against my head.

328
00:16:44,562 --> 00:16:45,620
Just doing my job.

329
00:16:45,697 --> 00:16:47,688
It also says you were
recently bitten by a raccoon.

330
00:16:47,766 --> 00:16:49,199
And a rat.

331
00:16:49,467 --> 00:16:50,934
Separate occasions.

332
00:16:52,203 --> 00:16:55,434
You spend your whole life trying
to get people to like you,

333
00:16:55,507 --> 00:16:59,307
and then you run over one
person with your car,

334
00:16:59,377 --> 00:17:03,143
and it's not even one of the popular
ones, and everybody gets on your case.

335
00:17:03,214 --> 00:17:05,273
It doesn't
make any sense.

336
00:17:05,350 --> 00:17:07,011
God is dead.

337
00:17:07,085 --> 00:17:10,248
If there was a God, then Ryan
and I would be married by now.

338
00:17:10,322 --> 00:17:13,018
Maybe believing
in God was a mistake.

339
00:17:14,292 --> 00:17:16,226
What did people
believe in before?

340
00:17:17,796 --> 00:17:19,093
The sun?

341
00:17:19,464 --> 00:17:22,365
Maybe there's
some sort of animal

342
00:17:22,434 --> 00:17:24,732
that we could make
a sacrifice to,

343
00:17:24,803 --> 00:17:28,034
like a giant buffalo,

344
00:17:28,306 --> 00:17:32,003
or some sort
of monster,

345
00:17:32,077 --> 00:17:35,478
like something with
the body of a walrus

346
00:17:36,414 --> 00:17:38,575
with the head of

347
00:17:39,284 --> 00:17:40,911
a sea lion.

348
00:17:41,453 --> 00:17:44,513
Or something with
the body of an egret

349
00:17:46,958 --> 00:17:48,858
with the head
of a meerkat.

350
00:17:49,594 --> 00:17:51,459
Or just

351
00:17:53,398 --> 00:17:55,866
the head of a monkey with

352
00:17:56,334 --> 00:17:58,666
the antlers of a reindeer

353
00:18:01,239 --> 00:18:02,729
with the body of

354
00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:06,134
a

355
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,177
porcupine.

356
00:18:12,684 --> 00:18:13,776
I will do
some research.

357
00:18:13,852 --> 00:18:14,910
Okay.

358
00:18:14,986 --> 00:18:15,975
I can help you
with that.

359
00:18:16,054 --> 00:18:17,214
Okay.

360
00:18:20,358 --> 00:18:23,020
So, just to be safe, they are
giving her the rabies vaccine.

361
00:18:23,094 --> 00:18:25,153
Oh, God, rabies?

362
00:18:26,064 --> 00:18:28,624
I was in the hospital
room with her.

363
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:29,724
How contagious
is that?

364
00:18:29,801 --> 00:18:31,063
Is that like an STD? No. No.

365
00:18:31,136 --> 00:18:32,160
You've got to be
bitten by something.

366
00:18:32,237 --> 00:18:34,137
This place is
so cursed.

367
00:18:34,205 --> 00:18:36,696
Actually, the doctor said it was
lucky she came into the hospital,

368
00:18:36,775 --> 00:18:37,969
because the only
way to beat rabies

369
00:18:38,043 --> 00:18:40,705
is to start treatment
before the symptoms set in.

370
00:18:40,779 --> 00:18:42,212
Lockjaw.

371
00:18:48,753 --> 00:18:52,587
I know a lot of you are very upset with
me for endangering Meredith's life

372
00:18:52,657 --> 00:18:55,091
by hitting her
with my car.

373
00:18:56,094 --> 00:19:00,053
But it may make you feel a little bit
better to know that before that happened,

374
00:19:00,131 --> 00:19:04,227
Dwight endangered her life by
putting a garbage bag over her head

375
00:19:04,302 --> 00:19:06,099
that had a bat in it.

376
00:19:06,871 --> 00:19:08,031
Six of one, really.

377
00:19:08,106 --> 00:19:12,839
Turns out Meredith has
been exposed to rabies,

378
00:19:12,911 --> 00:19:17,439
which is like 10 times worse than
a little crack in your pelvis.

379
00:19:17,715 --> 00:19:21,583
Thanks to me, she went to the
hospital and that saved her life.

380
00:19:21,653 --> 00:19:23,245
Curse is broken.

381
00:19:23,555 --> 00:19:27,719
Curse is broken, people.
Oh, there is a God.

382
00:19:27,792 --> 00:19:29,885
And he has a plan
for us after all.

383
00:19:29,961 --> 00:19:34,489
So go home, get some rest.
Very, very good work today.

384
00:19:35,733 --> 00:19:37,462
Got a lot
accomplished.

385
00:19:39,437 --> 00:19:43,203
Is there a God? If not, what
are all these churches for?

386
00:19:43,975 --> 00:19:47,001
And who is Jesus' dad?

387
00:19:56,221 --> 00:20:00,681
Oh, well, if they aren't together now,
then they probably never will be.

388
00:20:03,027 --> 00:20:06,929
I thought they'd be good
together, like PB and J.

389
00:20:08,366 --> 00:20:11,460
Pam Beasley and Jim.

390
00:20:13,404 --> 00:20:14,894
What a waste.

391
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:17,804
What a waste.

392
00:20:18,476 --> 00:20:20,808
I told you
I'm not dating anyone.

393
00:20:20,879 --> 00:20:22,676
And even if I was,

394
00:20:22,747 --> 00:20:25,409
I don't think
it's anyone's business.

395
00:20:25,483 --> 00:20:29,613
I mean, when I do fall in love,
like, when it's for real,

396
00:20:29,687 --> 00:20:33,088
the last person I'm going to talk
about it to is a camera crew

397
00:20:33,158 --> 00:20:34,989
or my co-workers.

398
00:20:39,631 --> 00:20:42,828
Almost marrying Roy Anderson was
as close to Pamela Anderson

399
00:20:42,901 --> 00:20:44,425
as I ever want to be.

400
00:20:45,236 --> 00:20:47,670
Trust me, when I fall
in love, you'll know.

401
00:20:55,547 --> 00:20:57,105
Michael Scott's
Dunder Mifflin Scranton

402
00:20:57,182 --> 00:20:59,116
Meredith Palmer Memorial

403
00:20:59,184 --> 00:21:02,017
Celebrity Rabies Awareness
F'un Run Race for the Cure.

404
00:21:02,086 --> 00:21:03,678
This is Pam.
Pro-Am.

405
00:21:04,222 --> 00:21:06,417
Pro-Am Race for the...
They hung up.

406
00:21:07,692 --> 00:21:11,651
A woman shouldn't have to be hit by a
car to learn that she may have rabies,

407
00:21:11,729 --> 00:21:14,459
but that is where
we are in America.

408
00:21:14,866 --> 00:21:18,199
And that does not
sit right with me.

409
00:21:18,436 --> 00:21:23,806
And that is why I am hosting a fun
run race for the cure for rabies.

410
00:21:23,875 --> 00:21:28,574
To raise awareness of the fact
that there is a cure for rabies,

411
00:21:28,646 --> 00:21:32,776
a disease that has been
largely eradicated in the US,

412
00:21:32,850 --> 00:21:35,216
but not very many
people know that.

413
00:21:35,286 --> 00:21:37,220
No, rabies.

414
00:21:37,922 --> 00:21:39,787
Babies would
be a good idea.

415
00:21:39,857 --> 00:21:41,518
Can I put you
down for a dime?

416
00:21:43,761 --> 00:21:45,991
Hi, Stankley,
how many sponsors so far?

417
00:21:46,064 --> 00:21:47,156
Zero.

418
00:21:48,266 --> 00:21:51,827
Come on, man, got to step it up.
It's for a good cause.

419
00:21:51,903 --> 00:21:54,736
Jan called this morning
and pledged $500.

420
00:21:54,806 --> 00:21:56,740
And isn't that
your money?

421
00:21:58,509 --> 00:22:01,740
It is for a good cause.

422
00:22:03,481 --> 00:22:05,244
Phyllis, how's
the rabies quilt coming?

423
00:22:05,316 --> 00:22:07,716
It's coming.
Oh, look at that, three.

424
00:22:07,785 --> 00:22:09,480
Way to honor Meredith, Phyllis.
Michael?

425
00:22:09,554 --> 00:22:11,351
Yes. You cannot make me run.

426
00:22:11,422 --> 00:22:13,617
Okay. It is not a real charity.

427
00:22:13,691 --> 00:22:15,682
It's stupid, Michael, and
I'm not going to do it.

428
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:17,250
All right. All right.
You didn't run for me

429
00:22:17,328 --> 00:22:18,920
When I thought I
had skin cancer.

430
00:22:19,297 --> 00:22:23,825
I know that you're probably scared of
people seeing your fat legs in shorts.

431
00:22:23,901 --> 00:22:24,959
No.

432
00:22:25,036 --> 00:22:28,096
Okay. Well, back in olden times,

433
00:22:28,172 --> 00:22:32,575
a large, fat person like
this was a person of power.

434
00:22:33,077 --> 00:22:37,411
A person who had money, could
buy food, a person of respect,

435
00:22:37,482 --> 00:22:39,643
like the regional
manager of the day.

436
00:22:39,717 --> 00:22:43,050
Whereas someone athletic
and trim like myself

437
00:22:43,121 --> 00:22:44,850
was someone who
worked in the fields

438
00:22:44,922 --> 00:22:46,412
and I was a peasant.

439
00:22:46,491 --> 00:22:47,981
I just don't
want to run.

440
00:22:48,059 --> 00:22:49,924
I didn't bring my
sneakers or my clothes.

441
00:22:49,994 --> 00:22:51,222
Well, you're going
to have to run

442
00:22:51,296 --> 00:22:53,787
or you're going to be
in a lot of trouble.

443
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,864
It is not olden times
anymore.

444
00:22:59,771 --> 00:23:04,538
I'm petrified of nipple chafing. Once
it starts, it is a vicious circle.

445
00:23:05,643 --> 00:23:09,204
You have sensitive nipples, they chafe.
So they become more sensitive,

446
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:10,907
so they chafe more.

447
00:23:10,982 --> 00:23:13,576
So I take precautions.

448
00:23:15,887 --> 00:23:17,013
Hey, Angela.

449
00:23:18,723 --> 00:23:22,318
Hey, I'm sorry
about your cat.

450
00:23:28,766 --> 00:23:32,167
This is Sprinkles.
She was my best friend.

451
00:23:33,237 --> 00:23:36,229
I kept her going through
countless ailments.

452
00:23:36,741 --> 00:23:41,371
I asked Dwight Schrute to feed her
once and she is now deceased.

453
00:23:46,351 --> 00:23:48,478
This is Halloween
last year.

454
00:23:50,188 --> 00:23:51,883
Just a couple
of kittens

455
00:23:53,124 --> 00:23:54,614
out on the town.

456
00:24:00,331 --> 00:24:01,491
Pssst.

457
00:24:07,338 --> 00:24:09,704
I'm having
relationship problems,

458
00:24:09,774 --> 00:24:12,675
and since you're always
having relationship problems,

459
00:24:12,744 --> 00:24:14,609
I thought you'd be able
to give me some advice.

460
00:24:14,679 --> 00:24:15,839
What's wrong?

461
00:24:15,913 --> 00:24:17,778
I have this
crazy thought

462
00:24:17,849 --> 00:24:19,510
that I know is crazy,

463
00:24:20,618 --> 00:24:22,916
that maybe Dwight
killed my cat.

464
00:24:23,454 --> 00:24:24,478
Hmm.

465
00:24:24,555 --> 00:24:27,149
When I got home, Sprinkles'
body was in the freezer

466
00:24:27,225 --> 00:24:29,022
where Dwight
said he left her.

467
00:24:29,093 --> 00:24:32,654
But all my bags of frozen F'rench
fries had been clawed to shreds.

468
00:24:32,997 --> 00:24:34,897
Something's not right.

469
00:24:35,233 --> 00:24:36,962
The vet's doing
an autopsy.

470
00:24:37,034 --> 00:24:38,524
Angela, I'm sorry.

471
00:24:38,603 --> 00:24:40,867
Did Roy ever kill
one of your cats?

472
00:24:41,439 --> 00:24:43,430
I'm more of
a dog person.

473
00:24:48,012 --> 00:24:49,673
So what's your
strategy for this race?

474
00:24:49,747 --> 00:24:51,180
Well, I'm going
to start fast.

475
00:24:51,249 --> 00:24:52,944
Then I'm going to run
fast in the middle. What?

476
00:24:53,017 --> 00:24:54,484
Then I'm going
to end fast.

477
00:24:54,552 --> 00:24:55,814
Why won't more
people do that?

478
00:24:55,887 --> 00:24:57,684
'Cause they're stupid.

479
00:25:00,258 --> 00:25:01,316
What?

480
00:25:15,406 --> 00:25:16,839
No, that's not...

481
00:25:16,908 --> 00:25:18,034
I mean, that wasn't...

482
00:25:18,109 --> 00:25:19,736
Yeah, that was...

483
00:25:19,811 --> 00:25:23,338
I mean, I can see how it
would seem a bit like we...

484
00:25:23,614 --> 00:25:26,515
How it looks like...

485
00:25:26,584 --> 00:25:28,552
But, I mean, nowadays you
can edit anything, right?

486
00:25:28,619 --> 00:25:33,249
You can edit anything
to look like anything.

487
00:25:33,357 --> 00:25:35,587
Yeah, I gave him
a ride home because...

488
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:37,651
Right.

489
00:25:37,728 --> 00:25:39,252
we're dating.

490
00:25:40,665 --> 00:25:43,156
Wow!
There it is.

491
00:25:44,335 --> 00:25:45,802
Yeah.

492
00:25:45,937 --> 00:25:49,202
We haven't told anybody,
but it's going really great.

493
00:25:50,975 --> 00:25:52,203
Right?

494
00:25:52,276 --> 00:25:53,800
It is going
really great.

495
00:25:55,012 --> 00:25:56,036
Ow!

496
00:25:56,113 --> 00:25:57,637
Shut up!

497
00:25:57,715 --> 00:26:00,411
You're taking this out on me,
but I was only the messenger.

498
00:26:00,485 --> 00:26:01,850
Oh, really?

499
00:26:07,191 --> 00:26:09,785
You'll feel better
after the 5K.

500
00:26:09,994 --> 00:26:12,121
Exercise is good
for depression.

501
00:26:12,196 --> 00:26:14,824
I'm not depressed.
I'm grieving.

502
00:26:16,834 --> 00:26:19,769
We have raised
almost $700,

503
00:26:19,837 --> 00:26:21,634
most of it
from me and Jan.

504
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:25,206
When do they put that
on the giant check,

505
00:26:25,276 --> 00:26:27,403
or is that something
that we write in later?

506
00:26:27,678 --> 00:26:30,442
Well, a giant check costs
about $200 to make up.

507
00:26:31,449 --> 00:26:34,441
I have a print shop standing by,
but what do you think, Michael?

508
00:26:34,519 --> 00:26:36,419
That's over 25%%
of our funds.

509
00:26:38,990 --> 00:26:41,151
That's a tough decision.

510
00:26:42,460 --> 00:26:44,325
I always imagined it
with a giant check.

511
00:26:44,395 --> 00:26:47,296
Yeah, I mean, I personally am definitely
on board for the giant check.

512
00:26:47,365 --> 00:26:48,389
Giant check it is.

513
00:26:48,466 --> 00:26:49,865
I don't know.

514
00:26:49,934 --> 00:26:53,870
On the other hand, it does leave
less money for bat birth control.

515
00:26:53,938 --> 00:26:55,599
Bat birth control?

516
00:26:56,274 --> 00:26:58,299
Wait, this money is going to bat
birth control, right, Michael?

517
00:26:58,376 --> 00:26:59,866
That's what you told
me when I contributed.

518
00:26:59,944 --> 00:27:01,673
You didn't contribute
very much.

519
00:27:01,746 --> 00:27:06,183
I was also hoping to hand the
giant check to a rabies doctor.

520
00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:07,774
And how's that going?

521
00:27:08,052 --> 00:27:11,749
Not well. A doctor won't come out
to collect a check for $700.

522
00:27:11,822 --> 00:27:13,687
Or $500, if we go
with the giant check.

523
00:27:13,758 --> 00:27:14,884
Which we are.

524
00:27:14,959 --> 00:27:18,258
And also, there is no such
thing as a rabies doctor.

525
00:27:19,330 --> 00:27:20,490
What about
a rabies nurse?

526
00:27:20,565 --> 00:27:21,657
I don't think so.

527
00:27:21,732 --> 00:27:25,463
You know what, though? I've actually seen ads
for nurses that you can hire by the hour

528
00:27:25,536 --> 00:27:27,595
for parties and
bachelor events.

529
00:27:27,672 --> 00:27:30,232
That's possible. Look into that.
Great.

530
00:27:30,308 --> 00:27:34,574
It's going to cost a couple hundred
bucks and... Actually more with tips.

531
00:27:34,645 --> 00:27:36,442
Maybe we should
skip the ceremony

532
00:27:36,514 --> 00:27:39,312
and just set up a college
fund for Meredith's son.

533
00:27:39,917 --> 00:27:42,715
Have you met that kid?
Not going to college.

534
00:27:45,323 --> 00:27:46,415
Michael...

535
00:27:47,725 --> 00:27:51,923
5K means five kilometers,
not 5,000 miles.

536
00:27:52,463 --> 00:27:54,090
Come in!

537
00:27:54,165 --> 00:27:55,291
Hey!
Oh, my God!

538
00:27:55,366 --> 00:27:56,560
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

539
00:27:56,634 --> 00:27:58,431
You said, come in! No, I didn't!

540
00:27:58,502 --> 00:28:00,299
Just, please, get out.
Oh, my God!

541
00:28:02,073 --> 00:28:04,303
So I closed the door
but the image of his...

542
00:28:04,375 --> 00:28:06,366
Baguette?
dangling participle

543
00:28:06,444 --> 00:28:08,776
still burned
in my eyes.

544
00:28:08,846 --> 00:28:10,074
I can imagine.

545
00:28:11,983 --> 00:28:13,143
Come in.

546
00:28:13,684 --> 00:28:14,946
May I enter
the room?

547
00:28:15,019 --> 00:28:17,487
Yes, or come in.

548
00:28:19,857 --> 00:28:21,620
See how I did that?

549
00:28:22,727 --> 00:28:23,989
That's the way
you should enter a room.

550
00:28:24,061 --> 00:28:25,551
You knock and then you
wait for the all clear.

551
00:28:25,630 --> 00:28:27,598
You couldn't have taken off all
your clothes in the men's room?

552
00:28:27,665 --> 00:28:30,259
Yes, but I have an office,
so why would I do that?

553
00:28:30,334 --> 00:28:33,997
On average, how many hours a day do you
spend naked in your office, just ballpark?

554
00:28:34,071 --> 00:28:36,904
European offices are naked all the time.
They're so not.

555
00:28:36,974 --> 00:28:38,703
Besides, my shirttail
covered most of it, so...

556
00:28:38,776 --> 00:28:40,937
I didn't see where it started,
but I saw where it ended.

557
00:28:41,012 --> 00:28:42,741
Gross.
That's not gross.

558
00:28:42,813 --> 00:28:45,304
It is a human body.
What is your problem?

559
00:28:45,383 --> 00:28:47,283
Pam, you're an artist, right?

560
00:28:47,351 --> 00:28:49,649
Think of me as
one of your models.

561
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:50,778
Okay, you know what?

562
00:28:50,855 --> 00:28:54,382
I don't want this to detract from what we
really need to be thinking about today.

563
00:28:54,458 --> 00:28:56,790
It's not fair to
people with rabies.

564
00:28:56,861 --> 00:28:59,887
And that's the point.
Right?

565
00:29:00,197 --> 00:29:01,425
Okay.
Let's go have some fun.

566
00:29:01,499 --> 00:29:02,659
All right.

567
00:29:03,234 --> 00:29:06,795
They say if you're nervous around
someone you should picture them naked.

568
00:29:06,871 --> 00:29:09,305
I do not recommend
this strategy.

569
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:13,308
Try picturing them with more
clothes on or a funny coat.

570
00:29:15,246 --> 00:29:18,215
Oh, I'm sorry.
Is this a working office?

571
00:29:18,416 --> 00:29:20,247
And not
a F'rench beach?

572
00:29:21,886 --> 00:29:23,183
Okay, name please.

573
00:29:23,254 --> 00:29:25,279
Creed Bratton.
75-plus division.

574
00:29:25,356 --> 00:29:26,914
You're over
75 years old?

575
00:29:26,991 --> 00:29:28,151
Eighty-two,
November 1st.

576
00:29:28,225 --> 00:29:29,351
How much is
the prize money?

577
00:29:29,427 --> 00:29:31,292
There's no
prize money.

578
00:29:31,362 --> 00:29:32,795
What?
Is any of this real?

579
00:29:32,863 --> 00:29:34,125
Check that out.

580
00:29:34,198 --> 00:29:36,962
"Look at me. I'm Toby.
I'm stretching.

581
00:29:37,034 --> 00:29:39,594
"I know what I'm doing."
Why is he even here?

582
00:29:43,374 --> 00:29:47,333
So I heard that you were
peeping on Michael.

583
00:29:47,411 --> 00:29:48,878
What?
No, it was not...

584
00:29:48,946 --> 00:29:53,076
Look, I don't know what your deal is,
but he's mine, okay? So, hands off.

585
00:29:53,884 --> 00:29:56,284
Okay, everybody!
Listen up!

586
00:29:57,488 --> 00:29:59,422
Thank you for coming.
Before we get started,

587
00:29:59,490 --> 00:30:01,583
I want to say
a few words

588
00:30:01,659 --> 00:30:05,026
about this deadly
disease called rabies.

589
00:30:05,129 --> 00:30:09,429
And I'd like you to take a
look into the face of rabies.

590
00:30:12,436 --> 00:30:15,064
That should scare you.
It scares me.

591
00:30:15,139 --> 00:30:16,868
You people need
to educate yourselves.

592
00:30:16,941 --> 00:30:20,900
Myth: Three Americans every
year die from rabies.

593
00:30:20,978 --> 00:30:25,540
F'act: Four Americans every
year die from rabies.

594
00:30:25,883 --> 00:30:28,613
How many of you
know someone

595
00:30:28,686 --> 00:30:31,655
who has been afflicted
or affected by rabies?

596
00:30:32,022 --> 00:30:35,458
Show of hands. One, two, three...
Too many to count.

597
00:30:35,526 --> 00:30:37,687
It is truly
the silent killer.

598
00:30:37,762 --> 00:30:41,220
No, it is the foaming,
barking killer.

599
00:30:41,298 --> 00:30:44,665
And it is something that comes...
Darryl, what are you doing?

600
00:30:44,735 --> 00:30:45,759
I'm giving him
a peanut.

601
00:30:45,836 --> 00:30:50,364
No, don't give him... Just...
Did you hear anything I said?

602
00:30:50,441 --> 00:30:51,499
Look how
happy he is.

603
00:30:51,575 --> 00:30:53,270
He's happy
because he's insane.

604
00:30:53,344 --> 00:30:55,107
You know what?
That's a perfect example

605
00:30:55,179 --> 00:30:58,205
of the kind of awareness
we need to generate.

606
00:30:58,282 --> 00:31:02,013
Where's the nurse? This
is the reason we're here.

607
00:31:02,086 --> 00:31:03,212
Hello, Michael.

608
00:31:03,287 --> 00:31:05,084
Oh, hey, I know you. Elizabeth?

609
00:31:05,156 --> 00:31:07,021
Yeah.
Right? Wow!

610
00:31:07,091 --> 00:31:09,525
Very cool. You went back
and got your degree.

611
00:31:09,593 --> 00:31:12,653
I would like you
to accept this check

612
00:31:14,465 --> 00:31:16,695
for $340,

613
00:31:17,434 --> 00:31:19,095
made out to "Science."

614
00:31:20,204 --> 00:31:22,035
Make sure that that gets
into the right hands.

615
00:31:22,106 --> 00:31:23,198
Great.

616
00:31:27,378 --> 00:31:28,868
You got it?

617
00:31:28,946 --> 00:31:30,004
Okay.

618
00:31:32,249 --> 00:31:34,513
F'ettuccine Alfredo.

619
00:31:35,452 --> 00:31:36,919
Time to carbo-load.

620
00:31:41,625 --> 00:31:45,254
Just remember, folks, it's not about
winning. It is about finishing!

621
00:31:46,297 --> 00:31:48,162
On your marks,

622
00:31:49,266 --> 00:31:51,097
get set...

623
00:31:51,435 --> 00:31:52,424
Hey!

624
00:32:07,418 --> 00:32:09,010
On your left!
Wow, you're fast.

625
00:32:09,086 --> 00:32:11,782
Doing great, Michael!
Look at you go!

626
00:32:11,856 --> 00:32:13,153
That's my boss!
Yeah!

627
00:32:13,224 --> 00:32:14,919
Think I'm fast?

628
00:32:15,292 --> 00:32:18,420
I'm very fast.
I'm like F'orrest Gump,

629
00:32:18,495 --> 00:32:21,123
except I am
not an idiot.

630
00:32:23,467 --> 00:32:25,697
Oh, yes,
I will work out today.

631
00:32:25,870 --> 00:32:29,806
I will work out a way to avoid
running for a stupid cause.

632
00:32:31,609 --> 00:32:35,409
I've walked two marathons. I'm
pretty sure I can handle a 5K.

633
00:32:36,347 --> 00:32:39,248
Key is drafting,
eliminate wind resistance.

634
00:32:44,555 --> 00:32:45,852
Yeah.

635
00:32:47,658 --> 00:32:48,989
Oh, we're
in last place.

636
00:32:49,059 --> 00:32:50,026
Oh, would you
look at that?

637
00:32:50,094 --> 00:32:51,322
Darn it.

638
00:32:56,066 --> 00:32:58,296
Water? Water?

639
00:33:00,971 --> 00:33:02,871
Water, babe?
No! No water for me!

640
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:06,137
Not while rabies causes
fear of water! Solidarity!

641
00:33:06,510 --> 00:33:08,068
Michael,
that's irrational.

642
00:33:08,145 --> 00:33:09,669
Rabies victims

643
00:33:10,481 --> 00:33:15,145
have to live with an irrational
hatred of water their entire lives.

644
00:33:15,219 --> 00:33:17,710
So, the least I can do...

645
00:33:19,223 --> 00:33:23,284
Oh, God, my nipples.
It's starting.

646
00:33:25,095 --> 00:33:26,722
Can we get another round? Okay.

647
00:33:26,797 --> 00:33:27,855
Thanks.

648
00:33:30,134 --> 00:33:32,762
So we've got what,
another 20 minutes?

649
00:33:32,836 --> 00:33:34,167
More or less.

650
00:33:37,007 --> 00:33:40,943
That fettuccine is sitting
in my stomach like a rock.

651
00:33:41,879 --> 00:33:44,871
You got nothing to worry about.
I put lmodium in Toby's coffee

652
00:33:44,949 --> 00:33:46,610
before the race.

653
00:33:46,684 --> 00:33:48,151
Excellent!

654
00:33:48,385 --> 00:33:50,410
Simpsons.

655
00:33:50,487 --> 00:33:52,216
Wait, lmodium
or Ex-Lax?

656
00:33:53,791 --> 00:33:55,520
I'm making great time.

657
00:33:55,592 --> 00:33:58,789
Usually, I'd have to take a bathroom
break halfway through a race like this,

658
00:33:58,862 --> 00:34:01,296
but not today.

659
00:34:04,635 --> 00:34:07,069
An estate sale.
Want to go in?

660
00:34:08,072 --> 00:34:09,869
I don't know. I'm really
committed to winning.

661
00:34:09,940 --> 00:34:12,408
Okay, but what if I told you that
all the money you spend here

662
00:34:12,476 --> 00:34:15,206
goes to preventing a disease
that's already been cured?

663
00:34:15,279 --> 00:34:16,644
Yes. That's what I thought.

664
00:34:16,714 --> 00:34:17,976
Yeah.
Right?

665
00:34:18,515 --> 00:34:20,244
Let's do some good.

666
00:34:21,952 --> 00:34:23,419
You have reached the offices

667
00:34:23,487 --> 00:34:24,613
of Dunder Mifflin Scranton.

668
00:34:24,688 --> 00:34:26,212
Currently,
the entire staff is out

669
00:34:26,290 --> 00:34:31,057
doing the Michael Scott DMSMPMC
Rabies Awareness Pro-Am Fun Run Race.

670
00:34:31,462 --> 00:34:33,157
For the cure.

671
00:34:33,230 --> 00:34:34,356
Leave a message.

672
00:34:37,001 --> 00:34:40,664
Oh, God.
Alfredo sauce.

673
00:34:41,905 --> 00:34:43,065
I'm getting a stitch.

674
00:34:46,410 --> 00:34:49,675
God! Watch the nipples, Kevin!

675
00:34:49,747 --> 00:34:51,476
Back off me.

676
00:34:51,849 --> 00:34:52,941
How are you feeling?
Better?

677
00:34:53,017 --> 00:34:54,143
No.

678
00:34:54,251 --> 00:34:57,345
Well, you look cute as a button.
You've worked up quite a sweat.

679
00:34:57,421 --> 00:34:59,719
The vet is removing all of
Sprinkles' organs right now

680
00:34:59,790 --> 00:35:01,587
and sending them
to the lab.

681
00:35:01,792 --> 00:35:03,487
I am a farmer, Angela.

682
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:04,618
What does
that mean?

683
00:35:04,695 --> 00:35:06,595
Okay, when a farmer sees
an animal that is in pain,

684
00:35:06,663 --> 00:35:09,427
that has no quality of
life, that has no utility,

685
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:12,901
a farmer does what city folk
don't have the stomach to do.

686
00:35:13,637 --> 00:35:15,502
You did kill her?

687
00:35:15,572 --> 00:35:18,234
I sang her
her favorite songs.

688
00:35:18,308 --> 00:35:19,741
You put her
in my freezer.

689
00:35:19,810 --> 00:35:22,040
It was beautiful and
gentle and respectful.

690
00:35:22,112 --> 00:35:24,706
I fed her antihistamines and
she gradually fell asleep.

691
00:35:24,782 --> 00:35:27,273
Well, then, she barfed them up in
the freezer and tried to get out.

692
00:35:27,351 --> 00:35:28,716
Well, I'm not responsible for that!
Get!

693
00:35:28,786 --> 00:35:30,117
Hey!

694
00:35:31,188 --> 00:35:32,246
It's okay.
It's nothing!

695
00:35:32,322 --> 00:35:33,380
I'm robbing her.

696
00:35:33,457 --> 00:35:34,788
It's nothing! It's nothing!
It's fine!

697
00:35:34,858 --> 00:35:35,847
What?

698
00:35:35,926 --> 00:35:37,791
How could you do that
without telling me?

699
00:35:37,861 --> 00:35:40,887
I thought I was helping you.
I expected a hug.

700
00:35:40,964 --> 00:35:44,798
I took care of that cat
the best way I knew how.

701
00:35:45,436 --> 00:35:48,030
Cat heaven is
a beautiful place,

702
00:35:48,105 --> 00:35:50,437
but you don't get there
if you're euthanized.

703
00:35:50,908 --> 00:35:54,036
I know a great taxidermist.
I'll pay to have her stuffed.

704
00:35:54,111 --> 00:35:56,204
Well, he's not great,
but he's pretty good.

705
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:58,111
You don't understand.

706
00:35:58,182 --> 00:36:00,582
Take bat bites seriously.
Don't get bit.

707
00:36:02,986 --> 00:36:06,319
Or we can have her buried out
at the east field, by mother.

708
00:36:08,025 --> 00:36:09,083
Huh?
Angela?

709
00:36:09,159 --> 00:36:10,183
Don't touch me,
Dwight.

710
00:36:22,639 --> 00:36:25,005
You like it? It's kind
of designy and cool.

711
00:36:25,075 --> 00:36:26,406
It was $8.

712
00:36:27,144 --> 00:36:29,009
Oh, and
I get to carry it.

713
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:46,160
And the winner
is Toby F'lenderson.

714
00:36:47,731 --> 00:36:49,756
Have a seat.
I'll write it down.

715
00:36:54,471 --> 00:36:55,768
Where are we?

716
00:36:55,839 --> 00:36:58,706
I don't know, like five
kilometers from the office.

717
00:37:00,444 --> 00:37:02,469
He couldn't have
made it a circle?

718
00:37:10,888 --> 00:37:12,583
I am not
going to finish.

719
00:37:15,259 --> 00:37:17,090
I can't beat rabies.

720
00:37:18,061 --> 00:37:19,187
Nobody can beat rabies.

721
00:37:19,263 --> 00:37:22,255
Rabies has been around
for a thousand years

722
00:37:22,332 --> 00:37:24,994
and I was a fool to think
that I could beat it.

723
00:37:30,941 --> 00:37:33,000
Yeah, probably.
Hey.

724
00:37:34,878 --> 00:37:35,970
Michael?

725
00:37:37,581 --> 00:37:40,277
What are you doing here?
Did you come back for us?

726
00:37:40,350 --> 00:37:41,840
I can't finish.

727
00:37:42,819 --> 00:37:44,616
I feel so weak.
I just...

728
00:37:44,688 --> 00:37:45,985
Well, you're probably
dehydrated.

729
00:37:46,056 --> 00:37:47,648
What do you want
me to do, Jim?

730
00:37:47,724 --> 00:37:48,884
Glass of water
would be a start.

731
00:37:48,959 --> 00:37:51,985
No.
There are people

732
00:37:52,062 --> 00:37:56,965
all over the world with all sorts of
problems and afflictions and diseases.

733
00:37:57,034 --> 00:37:58,831
They're deformed

734
00:37:59,436 --> 00:38:02,234
and they're abnormal and

735
00:38:02,306 --> 00:38:05,332
they're illiterate
and ugly.

736
00:38:05,642 --> 00:38:07,576
Symphonies don't
have any money.

737
00:38:07,644 --> 00:38:09,874
Public TV is bust.

738
00:38:09,947 --> 00:38:12,780
I can't do anything about it.
I can't, you know...

739
00:38:13,850 --> 00:38:15,715
There's just one of me.

740
00:38:16,186 --> 00:38:18,450
And there's
a thousand of them.

741
00:38:19,590 --> 00:38:20,921
And rabies wins.

742
00:38:21,024 --> 00:38:23,492
Wow!
You are a downer.

743
00:38:24,228 --> 00:38:26,059
We were having
a pretty nice day.

744
00:38:26,129 --> 00:38:27,391
I'm still having
a nice day.

745
00:38:27,464 --> 00:38:29,398
You are?
Yeah.

746
00:38:29,466 --> 00:38:33,425
Hey, Michael, look at this lamp.
$8.

747
00:38:33,503 --> 00:38:35,164
That's a good deal.

748
00:38:36,607 --> 00:38:39,599
And Michael,
you don't have rabies,

749
00:38:39,676 --> 00:38:43,043
and chances are you're not
going to get it anytime soon.

750
00:38:43,113 --> 00:38:46,412
So, you don't really have
to think about it too much.

751
00:38:46,483 --> 00:38:50,419
Pam, if everybody felt that
way, nothing would get done.

752
00:38:51,588 --> 00:38:56,548
Yeah, but there's other, better
people out there who are helping.

753
00:38:56,627 --> 00:39:00,893
You just don't think I am
capable of making a difference.

754
00:39:02,032 --> 00:39:05,468
I know you, Michael.
I saw you naked.

755
00:39:06,203 --> 00:39:07,636
You don't...

756
00:39:08,472 --> 00:39:10,201
You don't know me.

757
00:39:10,374 --> 00:39:13,537
You've just seen my penis.
I can make a difference.

758
00:39:13,610 --> 00:39:16,807
Remember, I'm the one who
started this whole thing off

759
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:18,848
by hitting Meredith
with my car.

760
00:39:19,383 --> 00:39:23,877
And I owe it to her
to finish this GD 5K.

761
00:39:29,293 --> 00:39:30,624
No! No!

762
00:39:44,074 --> 00:39:49,944
Finishing that 5K was the hardest
thing I have ever had to do.

763
00:39:52,849 --> 00:39:57,081
I ate more fettuccine Alfredo
and drank less water

764
00:39:57,154 --> 00:39:59,213
than I have in
my entire life.

765
00:40:00,924 --> 00:40:03,984
People always talk about
triumphs of the human spirit.

766
00:40:04,061 --> 00:40:08,896
Well, today, I had a
triumph of the human body.

767
00:40:09,299 --> 00:40:11,733
That's why everybody was
applauding for me at the end,

768
00:40:11,802 --> 00:40:13,599
my guts and my heart.

769
00:40:16,239 --> 00:40:20,266
And while I eventually
puked my guts out, I never

770
00:40:21,645 --> 00:40:23,738
puked my heart out.

771
00:40:24,147 --> 00:40:26,843
I'm very,
very proud of that.

772
00:40:30,153 --> 00:40:31,745
Hey, Michael.

773
00:40:31,822 --> 00:40:32,948
Hey, Mere.

774
00:40:33,523 --> 00:40:35,491
How are you doing?
Better.

775
00:40:35,559 --> 00:40:37,151
It's ironic,
isn't it?

776
00:40:37,227 --> 00:40:39,855
I mean, I'm in the hospital
for not getting enough water

777
00:40:39,930 --> 00:40:43,331
and you're in it for a disease
that causes a fear of water.

778
00:40:44,434 --> 00:40:46,561
I'm in because you
hit me with your car.

779
00:40:47,437 --> 00:40:51,567
But I want to say, I heard you
were trying really hard, so

780
00:40:52,442 --> 00:40:54,239
I'm not mad
at you anymore.

781
00:40:54,978 --> 00:40:56,206
Thanks.

782
00:40:57,013 --> 00:40:59,208
I'm not mad
at you anymore.

783
00:41:07,090 --> 00:41:08,352
Want to share?

784
00:41:09,559 --> 00:41:10,583
Sure.

785
00:41:10,660 --> 00:41:11,957
I'm not really sick.

786
00:41:19,870 --> 00:41:21,235
No, I'm good.
