1
00:00:00,108 --> 00:00:02,201
Yeah. Everything. It's all good.
It's all good. Phyllis.

2
00:00:02,277 --> 00:00:03,301
Dancing babies.

3
00:00:03,378 --> 00:00:04,902
Dancing babies.
I love it. I love it.

4
00:00:04,979 --> 00:00:08,107
We are making a commercial
for Dunder Mifflin today,

5
00:00:08,183 --> 00:00:09,514
our first ad ever.

6
00:00:09,918 --> 00:00:12,148
Corporate purchased some
airtime in local markets

7
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:14,017
to spread the word
about Dunder Mifflin Infinity,

8
00:00:14,089 --> 00:00:17,581
and they are even sending up
a professional ad company

9
00:00:17,659 --> 00:00:22,028
to help us make it later.
So it's not too shabby.

10
00:00:22,597 --> 00:00:24,121
Best ad ever?

11
00:00:24,199 --> 00:00:27,293
Give me a break,
give me a break

12
00:00:27,368 --> 00:00:29,666
Break me off
a piece of that

13
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:35,632
I am totally blanking.
What is the thing?

14
00:00:35,710 --> 00:00:36,904
Nobody tell him.

15
00:00:36,978 --> 00:00:38,673
What?
No. Why?

16
00:00:38,746 --> 00:00:40,111
You got it.
You're so close.

17
00:00:40,181 --> 00:00:42,172
Break me off
a piece of that

18
00:00:45,153 --> 00:00:46,450
Applesauce

19
00:00:46,521 --> 00:00:49,046
"Break me off a piece of that
applesauce." I don't think so.

20
00:00:49,124 --> 00:00:50,921
A piece of that
Chrysler car

21
00:00:50,992 --> 00:00:52,050
Nope.

22
00:00:52,127 --> 00:00:53,287
Football cream

23
00:00:53,361 --> 00:00:54,919
Okay.
It's football cream.

24
00:00:54,996 --> 00:00:57,726
It's football cream. All
right, so, anybody else?

25
00:00:57,799 --> 00:01:01,030
I'm taking a computer animation
class, so I can try to do a logo.

26
00:01:01,102 --> 00:01:02,160
Look at that.

27
00:01:02,237 --> 00:01:05,604
Even the receptionist is getting in on
the creativity. Very good. Very good.

28
00:01:05,807 --> 00:01:06,967
Hello. Hello.

29
00:01:07,041 --> 00:01:08,303
Hey. How you doing?
Michael Scott.

30
00:01:08,376 --> 00:01:09,536
Hey, Michael.
Regional manager.

31
00:01:09,611 --> 00:01:11,374
Hi, Michael. Nice to meet you.
Excited to talk ideas.

32
00:01:11,446 --> 00:01:12,504
Us, too, man.
You know what,

33
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:15,811
I want this to be cutting edge.
I want it to be fast.

34
00:01:15,884 --> 00:01:19,376
Quick cuts, you know?
Youthful, sort of a

35
00:01:19,454 --> 00:01:20,716
MTV-on-crack
kind of thing.

36
00:01:20,788 --> 00:01:21,812
That sounds great.

37
00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:24,358
All right. Good. Well, this
is what we have to work with.

38
00:01:24,425 --> 00:01:28,088
I would like you to meet
Andrew Bernard, the Nard Dog.

39
00:01:28,163 --> 00:01:29,755
Who let
the Nard dog out?

40
00:01:31,432 --> 00:01:33,457
He gives the best back
rubs in the office.

41
00:01:33,535 --> 00:01:36,504
That's true, I give a mean back rub.
Also do good aromatherapy.

42
00:01:38,439 --> 00:01:40,339
You just got
Nard-dogged!

43
00:01:40,408 --> 00:01:45,607
Now, this gentleman right here
is the key to our urban vibe.

44
00:01:46,014 --> 00:01:48,812
Urban? I grew up
in a small town.

45
00:01:48,883 --> 00:01:51,078
What about me
seems urban to you?

46
00:01:51,152 --> 00:01:52,278
Stanley is hilarious.

47
00:01:52,353 --> 00:01:55,151
Phyllis is like
our Mrs. Butterworth.

48
00:01:55,223 --> 00:01:57,316
Kind of a less
urban Aunt Jemima.

49
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:00,819
These are our accountants.

50
00:02:00,895 --> 00:02:05,764
And as you can see, they
are very different sizes.

51
00:02:05,833 --> 00:02:08,495
What you might
want to do is kind of

52
00:02:08,570 --> 00:02:11,562
a Papa Bear, Mama Bear,
Baby Bear thing.

53
00:02:11,639 --> 00:02:12,731
That might be
kind of fun.

54
00:02:12,807 --> 00:02:13,933
Mama Bear.

55
00:02:14,008 --> 00:02:14,997
Who else?

56
00:02:15,143 --> 00:02:17,441
I think it's great that the
company's making a commercial,

57
00:02:17,512 --> 00:02:20,675
because not very many
people have heard of us.

58
00:02:20,748 --> 00:02:23,046
I mean, when I tell people
that I work at Dunder Mifflin,

59
00:02:23,117 --> 00:02:28,783
they think that we sell mufflers
or muffins or mittens or...

60
00:02:29,924 --> 00:02:33,553
And frankly all of those sound better
than paper, so I let it slide.

61
00:03:12,467 --> 00:03:13,832
You playing
that game again?

62
00:03:13,901 --> 00:03:18,361
Second Life is not a game. It is a
multi-user virtual environment.

63
00:03:18,439 --> 00:03:20,236
It doesn't have
points or scores.

64
00:03:20,308 --> 00:03:21,969
It doesn't have
winners or losers.

65
00:03:22,043 --> 00:03:23,442
Oh, it has losers.

66
00:03:23,678 --> 00:03:26,613
I signed up for Second
Life about a year ago.

67
00:03:26,681 --> 00:03:30,048
Back then, my life was so great that
I literally wanted a second one.

68
00:03:30,118 --> 00:03:33,019
In my second life,
I was also a paper salesman

69
00:03:33,087 --> 00:03:34,918
and I was also
named Dwight.

70
00:03:34,989 --> 00:03:36,786
Absolutely everything
was the same.

71
00:03:37,558 --> 00:03:39,287
Except I could fly.

72
00:03:39,661 --> 00:03:43,427
Little girl in a field
holding a flower.

73
00:03:43,564 --> 00:03:47,193
We zoom back to find
that she's in the desert

74
00:03:48,169 --> 00:03:49,966
and the field
is an oasis.

75
00:03:50,038 --> 00:03:52,029
We zoom
back further,

76
00:03:52,106 --> 00:03:56,975
the desert is a sandbox in the
world's largest resort hotel.

77
00:03:57,045 --> 00:04:01,880
Zoom back further, the hotel
is actually the playground

78
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:04,880
of the world's
largest prison.

79
00:04:05,353 --> 00:04:07,082
But we zoom back further...
Okay,

80
00:04:07,155 --> 00:04:08,554
I can tell that your
time is valuable...

81
00:04:08,623 --> 00:04:10,056
Actually,

82
00:04:10,224 --> 00:04:12,351
I don't get paid by the hour
anymore, but thank you.

83
00:04:12,427 --> 00:04:14,156
I get paid
by the year.

84
00:04:14,228 --> 00:04:16,321
So... That all sounds
really, really ambitious.

85
00:04:16,397 --> 00:04:17,659
Yeah. I know.

86
00:04:17,732 --> 00:04:20,098
Why don't we show you what we
did with the Nashua branch?

87
00:04:20,168 --> 00:04:21,157
Mmm...

88
00:04:21,803 --> 00:04:22,895
Okay.

89
00:04:54,502 --> 00:04:56,163
That's what Nashua
came up with?

90
00:04:56,237 --> 00:04:58,296
That sucks. Wow.

91
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:00,732
That's what we
came up with.

92
00:05:00,808 --> 00:05:02,275
Well, we can do
better than that.

93
00:05:02,343 --> 00:05:04,573
Well, the main part of the ad
has to stay the same, actually.

94
00:05:04,645 --> 00:05:07,910
Yeah, it's the last five seconds
where we have some leeway.

95
00:05:09,384 --> 00:05:10,874
The waving?

96
00:05:10,952 --> 00:05:13,386
Well, no, no. You don't have to be waving.
That was just what they did.

97
00:05:13,454 --> 00:05:15,217
You guys can
be clapping

98
00:05:15,289 --> 00:05:18,224
or sitting, standing
outside, inside, whatever.

99
00:05:18,292 --> 00:05:20,760
And this is where you
really get to be creative.

100
00:05:21,529 --> 00:05:26,523
I need some advice. I've been spending a
lot of time making out with Angela lately.

101
00:05:26,634 --> 00:05:30,195
We've been necking.
But only necking. Right?

102
00:05:30,271 --> 00:05:34,537
Not actually
kissing our mouths.

103
00:05:34,609 --> 00:05:36,509
Just neck on neck.

104
00:05:36,577 --> 00:05:40,911
It's just like rubbinglnuzzling
our necks together.

105
00:05:40,982 --> 00:05:44,349
It's hot. I'm not gonna lie to
you, but it's a little weird.

106
00:05:44,419 --> 00:05:46,614
But you seem like
a guy with answers.

107
00:05:46,687 --> 00:05:49,986
So how do I fast track
this, get to first base?

108
00:05:50,057 --> 00:05:52,321
We cannot
talk about this,

109
00:05:53,494 --> 00:05:57,055
because someone
might hear us.

110
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:00,196
We'll use code names.

111
00:06:01,302 --> 00:06:06,239
Angela can stay the same, but
we'll change Andy to Dwight.

112
00:06:07,975 --> 00:06:10,102
That's not
different enough.

113
00:06:11,312 --> 00:06:12,472
Dwike?

114
00:06:15,917 --> 00:06:18,044
You have a call
from Eddie Murphy.

115
00:06:23,257 --> 00:06:24,349
Hello.

116
00:06:24,425 --> 00:06:26,893
MICHAEL IMITATING EDDIE MURPHY Shrek.
Shrek. I'm a donkey.

117
00:06:26,961 --> 00:06:28,394
I'm a donkey, Shrek.

118
00:06:29,931 --> 00:06:33,094
I'm just kidding.
It's me. Hello, Ry.

119
00:06:33,601 --> 00:06:35,728
What?
Okay, calm down.

120
00:06:35,803 --> 00:06:37,134
I just have
a small problem.

121
00:06:37,205 --> 00:06:38,934
I told you not to call
about small problems.

122
00:06:39,006 --> 00:06:41,406
Yeah. Well, when I call
about big problems,

123
00:06:41,476 --> 00:06:44,775
you don't like that either,
so make up your mind, kiddo.

124
00:06:44,846 --> 00:06:50,751
Here is the deal, the ad guys that you
sent are locking me in a creative box

125
00:06:50,818 --> 00:06:52,843
and sort of
ignoring my ideas.

126
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,854
That's good. They're creative.
You're not.

127
00:06:55,656 --> 00:06:57,385
I'm creative, Ryan.

128
00:06:57,458 --> 00:06:58,925
It's not part
of your job.

129
00:06:58,993 --> 00:07:00,426
It's, like,
maybe you can cook,

130
00:07:00,495 --> 00:07:02,986
but that doesn't mean you
should start a restaurant.

131
00:07:03,064 --> 00:07:05,498
Well, actually I can't cook and
I am starting a restaurant,

132
00:07:05,566 --> 00:07:07,193
Mike's Cereal Shack.

133
00:07:07,635 --> 00:07:11,230
I'm thinking we'll have as many
varieties as you can buy in the store.

134
00:07:11,305 --> 00:07:13,034
Okay. I'm not really
interested in that right now.

135
00:07:13,307 --> 00:07:15,969
I'm delegating creativity
to creative professionals.

136
00:07:16,043 --> 00:07:17,203
It's a different
skill set.

137
00:07:17,278 --> 00:07:19,246
Look, I wasn't good at sales, right?
Yeah!

138
00:07:19,313 --> 00:07:21,281
But I'm good at managing
people who do sales.

139
00:07:21,349 --> 00:07:24,614
Are you? I don't think you're
doing such a great job here,

140
00:07:24,685 --> 00:07:27,085
suppressing ideas
and creativity.

141
00:07:27,855 --> 00:07:30,847
All right, let me ask you this. Tell
me if you think this is creative.

142
00:07:30,925 --> 00:07:32,517
When I was five,

143
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:37,121
I imagined that there was
such a thing as a unicorn.

144
00:07:37,732 --> 00:07:42,101
And this was before I had even
heard of one or seen one.

145
00:07:42,169 --> 00:07:45,969
I just drew
a picture of a horse

146
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:50,409
that could fly over rainbows and
had a huge spike in its head.

147
00:07:51,445 --> 00:07:53,845
I was five,
five years old.

148
00:07:55,416 --> 00:07:57,008
Couldn't even talk yet.

149
00:07:59,086 --> 00:08:03,819
Hey, guys. You know what? We
cannot shoot this ad today.

150
00:08:04,859 --> 00:08:06,156
Okay, when should we come back?

151
00:08:06,227 --> 00:08:09,321
How about
never-hundred hours, sir?

152
00:08:10,264 --> 00:08:11,492
Wait, we were
sent here to help...

153
00:08:11,566 --> 00:08:13,227
I'm not gonna
argue with this guy.

154
00:08:13,301 --> 00:08:14,461
Let's go.

155
00:08:14,535 --> 00:08:15,797
Good luck, dude.
Hey, thanks.

156
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:17,098
Thank you.
Thank you.

157
00:08:17,171 --> 00:08:18,638
Michael,
David Wallace.

158
00:08:18,706 --> 00:08:21,072
What is this about
dismissing the ad people?

159
00:08:21,142 --> 00:08:24,942
Yeah. I'm glad you called. Ryan
is being a little bitch again.

160
00:08:25,012 --> 00:08:26,138
I'm on, Michael.

161
00:08:26,213 --> 00:08:28,078
What's up,
my brother?

162
00:08:28,349 --> 00:08:32,843
Listen, David, I would like
to do this ad in-house.

163
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:37,914
I want to use only the creativity that
we have right here in the office,

164
00:08:37,992 --> 00:08:40,187
and I will send it to
you tomorrow morning.

165
00:08:40,261 --> 00:08:43,560
Take a look at it. If you do not
think that it's ready to air,

166
00:08:43,631 --> 00:08:46,191
send the ad agency
back down here

167
00:08:46,267 --> 00:08:48,633
and we'll do it
on my dime.

168
00:08:50,071 --> 00:08:51,402
This is weird.

169
00:08:51,472 --> 00:08:54,566
I'm willing to stake
my entire reputation on it.

170
00:08:55,309 --> 00:08:58,107
Okay. I'll see
you tomorrow.

171
00:08:58,179 --> 00:08:59,373
Okay.
Okay.

172
00:09:01,115 --> 00:09:05,108
And thus Michael Scott
sealed his own destiny.

173
00:09:07,788 --> 00:09:09,278
In a good way.

174
00:09:11,192 --> 00:09:14,923
Has anyone ever come up to you
and said, "You're not creative"?

175
00:09:15,830 --> 00:09:16,888
Yes.

176
00:09:16,964 --> 00:09:19,626
Well, they're wrong.
You are creative.

177
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:22,635
You are damn creative,
each and every one of you.

178
00:09:22,703 --> 00:09:24,933
You are so much
more creative

179
00:09:25,006 --> 00:09:28,703
than all of the other dry, boring
morons that you work with.

180
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:31,377
Who are you talking to,
specifically?

181
00:09:31,579 --> 00:09:35,106
I kind of know what it's
like to be in commercials.

182
00:09:35,182 --> 00:09:38,618
My nickname in high school
used to be Kool-Aid Man.

183
00:09:40,855 --> 00:09:43,255
When I was younger I always wanted
to be an actor in commercials,

184
00:09:43,324 --> 00:09:45,258
then I realized
I had a brain.

185
00:09:45,526 --> 00:09:49,462
I'm excited about doing the ad, but
I'm not really used to doing videos

186
00:09:49,530 --> 00:09:51,498
with so many
people around.

187
00:09:51,999 --> 00:09:54,559
We have three scenes
to film, big scenes.

188
00:09:54,635 --> 00:09:56,796
We have a song to write,
so let's get cracking.

189
00:09:56,871 --> 00:09:58,771
Kelly, I want you
to do makeup.

190
00:09:58,839 --> 00:10:02,707
Oscar, I would like you to do
costume design, obviously.

191
00:10:02,777 --> 00:10:04,244
Phyllis, I'd like you
to look around town

192
00:10:04,311 --> 00:10:07,474
and see if we have any
celebrities in our local area.

193
00:10:08,716 --> 00:10:10,479
Sue Grafton is at
the Steamtown Mall.

194
00:10:10,551 --> 00:10:12,109
She's doing a book
signing right now.

195
00:10:12,186 --> 00:10:13,983
Okay, okay. Phyllis, this
is what I want you to do.

196
00:10:14,055 --> 00:10:17,115
I want you to go down to the mall.
I want you to get in line.

197
00:10:17,191 --> 00:10:20,251
I want you to get her
to be in this commercial.

198
00:10:21,429 --> 00:10:24,921
This would be a huge coup, people.
All right?

199
00:10:24,999 --> 00:10:27,160
Do not take no for an answer.
Okay.

200
00:10:27,234 --> 00:10:29,464
Does anyone actually know
what Sue Grafton looks like?

201
00:10:29,537 --> 00:10:30,868
I mean is she hot, or...

202
00:10:30,938 --> 00:10:32,599
She's crazy hot.

203
00:10:32,673 --> 00:10:36,234
Well, then maybe we should just use
Angela and say she's Sue Grafton.

204
00:10:36,310 --> 00:10:37,504
Would anyone notice?

205
00:10:37,578 --> 00:10:38,602
That's not happening.

206
00:10:38,913 --> 00:10:41,473
I find the mystery
genre disgusting.

207
00:10:41,749 --> 00:10:43,614
I hate being titillated.

208
00:10:44,085 --> 00:10:45,109
Bye, everyone.

209
00:10:45,186 --> 00:10:46,448
Light it up, Phyllis.
Get her, Phyl.

210
00:10:55,629 --> 00:10:58,598
Out of paper, out of stock

211
00:10:58,666 --> 00:11:01,635
Those friendly faces
around the block

212
00:11:01,702 --> 00:11:04,034
Break loose
from the chains

213
00:11:04,105 --> 00:11:06,300
That are causing
you pain

214
00:11:06,373 --> 00:11:09,570
Call Michael and Stanley,
Jim, Dwight, Creed

215
00:11:09,643 --> 00:11:13,044
Call Andy and Kelly
For your business paper needs

216
00:11:13,114 --> 00:11:14,513

00:11:14,582 --> 00:11:16,243

The people person's

220
00:11:19,019 --> 00:11:22,284
Time out. Time out.
Time out. I thought...

221
00:11:22,356 --> 00:11:26,053
I was under the impression that
this was going to be a rap.

222
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:27,420
What's rap?

223
00:11:27,828 --> 00:11:29,989
Okay, Darryl, wow.

224
00:11:30,064 --> 00:11:31,895
You need to learn a lot
about your own culture.

225
00:11:31,966 --> 00:11:33,126
I'll make you a mix.

226
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,462
Great.

227
00:11:39,306 --> 00:11:44,266
News flash. I got some juicy updates
on Operation F'allen Angel.

228
00:11:44,912 --> 00:11:47,039
Remind me to
tell you later.

229
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:53,846
Hey.

230
00:11:53,921 --> 00:11:55,684
No talk.
I'm animating.

231
00:11:55,756 --> 00:11:58,122
Why don't we take a quick
10-second break from that

232
00:11:58,192 --> 00:12:00,057
so I can show you
what's going on here.

233
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:03,756
Okay, this is Dwight's Second Life.
He's on it all the time.

234
00:12:04,265 --> 00:12:07,826
So much so that his little guy
here has created his own world.

235
00:12:07,902 --> 00:12:09,563
It's called
Second Second Life

236
00:12:09,637 --> 00:12:12,606
for those people who want to be
removed even further from reality.

237
00:12:12,673 --> 00:12:13,970
Are you serious?
Yeah.

238
00:12:14,041 --> 00:12:16,373
Oh, my God.
He's really in pain.

239
00:12:17,244 --> 00:12:18,438
Who's that?

240
00:12:18,512 --> 00:12:21,037
Oh, it's just my avatar guy.
Whatever.

241
00:12:21,115 --> 00:12:23,083
He looks
a lot like you.

242
00:12:23,517 --> 00:12:25,451
Yeah. How much time did
you spend on that?

243
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:28,818
Not much. It's just for
tracking Dwight, so...

244
00:12:28,889 --> 00:12:31,949
Right. You're a sports
writer in Philadelphia?

245
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:34,352
Nice build, too.

246
00:12:35,129 --> 00:12:36,118
Yep.

247
00:12:36,197 --> 00:12:37,892
You have a guitar
slung on your back.

248
00:12:37,965 --> 00:12:40,058
I did not know
you played guitar.

249
00:12:41,268 --> 00:12:42,360
I...

250
00:12:43,470 --> 00:12:46,064
Why don't we go back to the animation?
No, no, no.

251
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:47,869
I want to see more of Philly Jim.
No, show me how this...

252
00:12:47,942 --> 00:12:49,068
I want Philly Jim.

253
00:12:49,143 --> 00:12:50,371
Show me
how this works.

254
00:12:50,444 --> 00:12:51,570
Oh, boy.

255
00:12:57,685 --> 00:13:00,882
Out of paper,
out of stock

256
00:13:01,155 --> 00:13:05,421
Those friendly faces
around the block

257
00:13:05,492 --> 00:13:07,551
Break loose from the chains

258
00:13:07,628 --> 00:13:10,153
That are causing you pain

259
00:13:10,231 --> 00:13:12,290
Call Michael, Stanley,
Jim, Dwight and Creed

260
00:13:12,366 --> 00:13:14,561
Call Andy and Kelly

261
00:13:14,635 --> 00:13:16,967

00:13:21,442 --> 00:13:22,602
It's the people
person's paper people

265
00:13:22,676 --> 00:13:25,144
Stop, stop, stop.

266
00:13:25,446 --> 00:13:28,279
This is not me. This is not...
It's not my music.

267
00:13:28,349 --> 00:13:31,113
You're right. It's better than you.
It's us.

268
00:13:31,185 --> 00:13:33,119
Dunder Mifflin

269
00:13:33,187 --> 00:13:34,211
The people person's
paper people

270
00:13:34,288 --> 00:13:36,381
No, no, no. I hate it!
I hate it.

271
00:13:37,892 --> 00:13:41,794
I don't hate it. I just don't like
it at all, and it's terrible.

272
00:13:44,231 --> 00:13:45,493
You're on your own, Mike.

273
00:13:45,566 --> 00:13:48,126
Okay, you know what?
Hold on, hold on, Darryl.

274
00:13:48,202 --> 00:13:49,760
You just said you hated it. No.

275
00:13:49,837 --> 00:13:52,328
You said you hated it.
I said I hate the style.

276
00:13:52,406 --> 00:13:55,671
Break me off a piece
of that lumber tar

277
00:13:55,876 --> 00:13:57,207
Snickers bar

278
00:13:57,278 --> 00:14:00,714
Okay. Wow. Wow.
This looks terrible.

279
00:14:00,781 --> 00:14:02,339
Break me off a piece
of that Grey Poupon

280
00:14:02,416 --> 00:14:05,010
Andy. Andy. This is a
pivotal scene in the ad.

281
00:14:05,085 --> 00:14:07,417
And if we don't get this,
if we don't nail it,

282
00:14:07,488 --> 00:14:09,888
we're gonna lose the whole
triumph of the moment.

283
00:14:09,957 --> 00:14:14,826
The triumph of the will. Now, God, what?
What, Phyllis?

284
00:14:14,895 --> 00:14:18,228
Well, I got in line
to buy Sue Grafton's book

285
00:14:18,299 --> 00:14:19,630
and when it came
to my turn,

286
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:22,794
I asked her if she wanted to be in the
ad, and she said, "No, thank you."

287
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:24,861
But I wasn't supposed to
take no for an answer...

288
00:14:24,939 --> 00:14:26,429
Attagirl.
so I kept on asking,

289
00:14:26,507 --> 00:14:30,307
and they finally threw me out of the
store in front of all my friends.

290
00:14:30,611 --> 00:14:31,600
Okay.

291
00:14:33,614 --> 00:14:35,980
Did you or did you
not get Sue Grafton?

292
00:14:37,952 --> 00:14:38,941
No.

293
00:14:39,019 --> 00:14:41,351
Oh, you're...

294
00:14:41,422 --> 00:14:43,890
Can somebody give her a tissue?
Please?

295
00:14:46,794 --> 00:14:49,524
I hope you're not killing yourself on
this, because I'm sure it's good enough

296
00:14:49,596 --> 00:14:53,088
for Michael's ad that will
probably be seen by no one.

297
00:14:53,167 --> 00:14:55,897
Maybe. But it's not
good enough for me yet.

298
00:14:55,970 --> 00:14:57,904
Okay. Do you want me to stay?

299
00:14:57,972 --> 00:15:00,406
No, no, you can go home.
I'm good.

300
00:15:00,908 --> 00:15:04,537
Pam is staying late tonight
to achieve her dreams,

301
00:15:04,611 --> 00:15:06,704
so I'm pretty
proud of her.

302
00:15:06,814 --> 00:15:08,042
Unfortunately,
she was my ride home.

303
00:15:08,115 --> 00:15:09,980
You coming?

304
00:15:11,251 --> 00:15:12,479
I...

305
00:15:12,553 --> 00:15:14,544
Piss or get
off the pot!

306
00:15:21,662 --> 00:15:22,856
Dunder Mifflin.
This is Pam.

307
00:15:22,930 --> 00:15:24,795
Good morning.

308
00:15:28,202 --> 00:15:29,931
Yeah, I'm sorry. I looked
away for a second,

309
00:15:30,004 --> 00:15:32,234
and Creed snatched
your hash browns.

310
00:15:32,306 --> 00:15:33,796
Thank you.
You're welcome.

311
00:15:34,074 --> 00:15:36,542
I worked until
about 2:45 a.m.,

312
00:15:36,610 --> 00:15:40,137
and then I had to decide if I wanted
to spend the night with Michael

313
00:15:40,214 --> 00:15:44,583
editing in his office and Dwight
watching Michael edit in his office,

314
00:15:44,651 --> 00:15:47,017
or drive home and probably
fall asleep at the wheel

315
00:15:47,087 --> 00:15:48,452
and die in
a fiery car wreck.

316
00:15:48,922 --> 00:15:51,686
I passed out on my
keyboard trying to decide.

317
00:15:53,727 --> 00:15:55,092
Let me pour
you some bubbly,

318
00:15:55,162 --> 00:15:58,689
because somebody got to a
whole new level last night.

319
00:15:58,766 --> 00:16:00,256
Andy, I can't hear
this right now.

320
00:16:00,334 --> 00:16:02,131
No. No. No.
This is good.

321
00:16:02,202 --> 00:16:03,692
You know how we haven't
really gotten anywhere

322
00:16:03,771 --> 00:16:05,966
that I want to get
to physically yet?

323
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:09,271
Well, last night,
that changed.

324
00:16:09,343 --> 00:16:12,779
We're making out. I'm kissing
her neck and her cheek

325
00:16:12,846 --> 00:16:16,407
and her ear lobe, and she's
not really kissing me back,

326
00:16:16,483 --> 00:16:20,146
but she closes her
eyes and she's like,

327
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:23,280
"Oh, D. Oh, D."

328
00:16:25,859 --> 00:16:28,089
She called you D?

329
00:16:28,562 --> 00:16:31,190
Yeah.
D for Andy.

330
00:16:32,699 --> 00:16:34,394
Oh, D.

331
00:16:35,536 --> 00:16:36,696
Oh, D.

332
00:16:36,770 --> 00:16:38,635
Oh, D.

333
00:16:38,705 --> 00:16:41,003
Oh, D.

334
00:16:41,075 --> 00:16:43,236
Oh, D!
Oh, D!

335
00:16:46,447 --> 00:16:48,915
Oh, D!
Oh, D!

336
00:16:51,385 --> 00:16:56,084
I'm about to send the ad to corporate.
And it is sent.

337
00:16:57,925 --> 00:17:00,917
They'll probably watch it right away.
I would.

338
00:17:02,329 --> 00:17:03,387
Okay.

339
00:17:07,835 --> 00:17:10,235
Yes? Pam, please clear
my phone lines.

340
00:17:10,304 --> 00:17:11,464
Certainly.

341
00:17:15,409 --> 00:17:16,808
Okay, clear.

342
00:17:18,145 --> 00:17:20,136
They could call
any second now.

343
00:17:23,817 --> 00:17:25,182
Oh, God.

344
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:34,350
I better call.

345
00:17:39,133 --> 00:17:41,226
Well, it's been tough.

346
00:17:41,301 --> 00:17:44,498
The geniuses at corporate
rejected my commercial,

347
00:17:44,571 --> 00:17:47,005
and tonight they are airing
the brain-dead version.

348
00:17:47,074 --> 00:17:49,133
So welcome
one and all

349
00:17:49,543 --> 00:17:52,410
to the world premiere
of corporate crap fest.

350
00:18:12,332 --> 00:18:13,458
Hey, seemed
like a big hit.

351
00:18:13,534 --> 00:18:14,967
No.
People are stupid.

352
00:18:15,035 --> 00:18:19,199
People like waving.
Waving sells, not art.

353
00:18:20,374 --> 00:18:23,673
The ad we made, our ad,
the real one,

354
00:18:23,744 --> 00:18:29,239
was full of humor and full of depth
and full of heart, and it was real.

355
00:18:30,717 --> 00:18:34,585
Hey, could you do me a favor? Could
you put that in the DVD player?

356
00:18:34,655 --> 00:18:36,555
Hey, everybody, I just
want to welcome you all

357
00:18:36,623 --> 00:18:40,525
to the premiere of the real
Dunder Mifflin commercial.

358
00:18:40,594 --> 00:18:44,086
The Michael Scott director's cut.
Hope you like it.

359
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,093
It all starts
with an idea.

360
00:18:50,537 --> 00:18:53,563
But you can never tell
where an idea will end up.

361
00:18:58,679 --> 00:19:00,476
Because ideas spread.

362
00:19:00,881 --> 00:19:02,678
They change, grow.

363
00:19:04,384 --> 00:19:06,682
They connect us
with the world.

364
00:19:12,125 --> 00:19:15,390
And in a fast-moving world,

365
00:19:15,462 --> 00:19:18,329
where good news moves
at the speed of time,

366
00:19:24,371 --> 00:19:27,898
and bad news isn't
always what it seems.

367
00:19:39,753 --> 00:19:42,187
Because when push
comes to shove,

368
00:19:48,428 --> 00:19:50,658
we all deserve
a second chance

369
00:19:55,269 --> 00:19:56,531
to score.

370
00:20:03,777 --> 00:20:07,907
Dunder Mifflin. Limitless
paper in a paperless world.

371
00:20:19,726 --> 00:20:22,024
Animation, all her, by the way.
Really?

372
00:20:22,095 --> 00:20:23,960
Yeah, I just thought...
The animation was cool.

373
00:20:24,031 --> 00:20:25,089
Thanks.

374
00:20:25,165 --> 00:20:27,759
Hey, listen, you ever been
on a motorcycle because...

375
00:20:27,834 --> 00:20:29,699
Michael, that was fun.

376
00:20:30,570 --> 00:20:32,037
That was fun.

377
00:20:32,739 --> 00:20:34,866
Next round of drinks
is on me, people.

378
00:20:39,379 --> 00:20:41,108
Claude Van Damme

379
00:20:43,884 --> 00:20:45,351
Hair for men

380
00:20:45,719 --> 00:20:47,880
Poison gas, NutraSweet

381
00:20:48,355 --> 00:20:50,516
It's got to rhyme
with "piece."

382
00:20:50,624 --> 00:20:51,921
F'ancy F'east.

383
00:20:51,992 --> 00:20:54,722
Break me off a piece
of that Fancy Feast

384
00:20:55,462 --> 00:20:57,657
It's the cat food.
Nailed it.
