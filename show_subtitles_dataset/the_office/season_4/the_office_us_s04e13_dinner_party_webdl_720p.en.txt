1
00:00:03,231 --> 00:00:04,493
This is ridiculous.

2
00:00:04,566 --> 00:00:06,966
Do you have any idea what
time we'll get out of here?

3
00:00:07,035 --> 00:00:10,198
Nobody likes to work late,
least of all me.

4
00:00:12,273 --> 00:00:13,297
Do you have
plans tonight?

5
00:00:13,375 --> 00:00:14,433
No, I don't.

6
00:00:14,509 --> 00:00:17,103
Remember when you told us not to
make plans, 'cause we were working?

7
00:00:17,178 --> 00:00:18,770
Yes, I remember.

8
00:00:19,547 --> 00:00:20,673
Hmm.

9
00:00:20,749 --> 00:00:23,684
This is BS. This is BS.
Why are we here?

10
00:00:23,785 --> 00:00:27,277
I am gonna call corporate.
Enough is enough. I'm...

11
00:00:27,355 --> 00:00:31,553
God, I'm so mad! This is
Michael Scott, Scranton.

12
00:00:31,693 --> 00:00:34,753
Well, we don't want to work.
No, we don't!

13
00:00:34,829 --> 00:00:37,389
It's not fair
to these people!

14
00:00:37,465 --> 00:00:40,923
These people are my friends,
and I care about them!

15
00:00:41,002 --> 00:00:42,594
We're not gonna do it!

16
00:00:44,506 --> 00:00:47,168
Everybody, I just got off
the horn with corporate,

17
00:00:47,242 --> 00:00:52,179
and basically I told them where they could
stick their little overtime assignment.

18
00:00:52,247 --> 00:00:53,839
Go enjoy your F'riday.
Thank you, Michael.

19
00:00:53,915 --> 00:00:55,075
All right.

20
00:00:55,150 --> 00:00:56,174
All right.
Happy F'riday.

21
00:00:56,251 --> 00:00:58,344
Well, I think we dodged a bullet, there.
I think you did.

22
00:00:58,453 --> 00:00:59,886
I think we should
celebrate.

23
00:01:00,021 --> 00:01:03,184
How about you, Pam, mi casa. A
little dinner, dancing, drinks?

24
00:01:03,258 --> 00:01:06,056
Oh, I... You said you
didn't have plans.

25
00:01:07,862 --> 00:01:09,625
That's what you said.

26
00:01:09,697 --> 00:01:13,793
Michael has asked Pam and me
to dinner at least nine times.

27
00:01:13,868 --> 00:01:16,735
And every time, we've been
able to get out of it.

28
00:01:16,805 --> 00:01:20,468
But I've got to give him credit.
He got me.

29
00:01:20,542 --> 00:01:22,908
Because I'm starting
to suspect

30
00:01:22,977 --> 00:01:25,445
that there was no
assignment from corporate.

31
00:01:25,513 --> 00:01:27,481
Michael, what time
should I be arriving?

32
00:01:28,483 --> 00:01:29,882
Dwight, it's couples only.

33
00:01:29,951 --> 00:01:35,150
And besides, I only have six wine glasses.
So it will be me and Jan, and Pam and Jim.

34
00:01:35,223 --> 00:01:37,054
And Angela
and Andy.

35
00:01:37,125 --> 00:01:38,524
Hey, oh!

36
00:01:39,794 --> 00:01:43,890
Does it bother me that I wasn't
invited to Michael's dinner party?

37
00:02:23,838 --> 00:02:25,533
- Hi.
- Hello.

38
00:02:25,607 --> 00:02:27,632
How are you?
Come on in.

39
00:02:27,709 --> 00:02:29,700
Good to see you.
Chilly, huh?

40
00:02:29,777 --> 00:02:31,574
I'm so glad
we finally...

41
00:02:31,679 --> 00:02:32,668
F'inally got to do this
with you guys.

42
00:02:32,747 --> 00:02:34,647
This is great.

43
00:02:35,016 --> 00:02:37,280
You want to take
their coats, babe?

44
00:02:37,352 --> 00:02:38,546
Yes, I would.
Okay.

45
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:41,987
All right. So, what
have you been doing?

46
00:02:42,056 --> 00:02:44,047
Let's see, since I saw
you an hour ago? Yeah!

47
00:02:44,125 --> 00:02:46,787
I have been getting ready,
and then driving over here.

48
00:02:46,861 --> 00:02:48,920
Well, we've been doing
pretty much the same thing.

49
00:02:48,997 --> 00:02:50,897
Really?
Except driving.

50
00:02:52,567 --> 00:02:53,932
We got you this.

51
00:02:54,035 --> 00:02:55,195
Pam!

52
00:02:55,270 --> 00:02:56,362
Thank you. That's so nice.
Thanks.

53
00:02:56,437 --> 00:02:58,132
This will be great
to cook with. Really.

54
00:02:58,206 --> 00:03:01,039
Well, have a seat,
or come on in, or...

55
00:03:01,109 --> 00:03:04,875
I don't know, make yourself
to home. This is our casa.

56
00:03:04,946 --> 00:03:06,072
- It's really nice.
- It's great.

57
00:03:06,147 --> 00:03:07,774
So, what do you guys think?
Should we do the tour first,

58
00:03:07,849 --> 00:03:09,407
should we have
appetizers first?

59
00:03:09,484 --> 00:03:11,509
Tour. Let's do the tour first.
Okay.

60
00:03:11,586 --> 00:03:13,554
You have a preference,
babe? Upstairs first?

61
00:03:13,621 --> 00:03:16,021
Totally your call, babe. All
right, well, let's go, then.

62
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:17,955
All right.
I say upstairs.

63
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:20,625
You guys doing
a little construction?

64
00:03:20,695 --> 00:03:22,959
Oh, just redoing
the sliding glass door.

65
00:03:23,031 --> 00:03:29,300
Yeah, so sorry about this God-awful carpet.
We are still a work in progress, here.

66
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:31,338
This is my office.

67
00:03:31,406 --> 00:03:33,169
Yup. Never been used.

68
00:03:33,241 --> 00:03:34,902
Not super-exciting.
No.

69
00:03:34,976 --> 00:03:37,240
And this is my work space.
This is it.

70
00:03:37,345 --> 00:03:38,437
Check that out.
You smell that?

71
00:03:38,513 --> 00:03:39,571
Uh-huh.

72
00:03:39,647 --> 00:03:43,048
As you can smell, there's a lot of
different odors going on in here.

73
00:03:43,384 --> 00:03:45,079
So you have an office
and a work space.

74
00:03:45,153 --> 00:03:48,680
I do, you know. I just... I
cannot create in the same space

75
00:03:48,756 --> 00:03:52,021
that I conduct business. I'm sure that
you're the same with your doodles.

76
00:03:52,093 --> 00:03:53,117
Smell.

77
00:03:54,429 --> 00:03:56,363
It's fire.
Bonfire.

78
00:03:56,431 --> 00:03:57,728
Bond!
Men love this one.

79
00:03:57,799 --> 00:04:02,327
James Bond-fire! "I am
Bond-fire... James Bond-fire."

80
00:04:02,403 --> 00:04:03,870
Michael Scott!

81
00:04:04,739 --> 00:04:08,641
When I get frustrated,
or irritated or...

82
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:11,645
Angry, I come up here and I
just smell all my candles!

83
00:04:11,713 --> 00:04:13,908
And it just... Poof!
Goes away.

84
00:04:13,982 --> 00:04:15,210
Just like that.
Just like that.

85
00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:17,750
So this is the
master bedroom.

86
00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:20,911
And these walls, they used to be,
like, white, like an asylum.

87
00:04:20,989 --> 00:04:23,856
So I wanted it to be softer, so I
had it painted an eggshell white.

88
00:04:23,925 --> 00:04:27,588
Guess what? White and eggshell
white are exactly the same color.

89
00:04:28,396 --> 00:04:29,693
Babe...
Exactly.

90
00:04:29,797 --> 00:04:31,662
I thought you said that you
were gonna tidy things up.

91
00:04:31,733 --> 00:04:33,166
Well, I...

92
00:04:33,234 --> 00:04:34,326
Shame on you.

93
00:04:37,639 --> 00:04:38,628
What a cute bench.

94
00:04:38,706 --> 00:04:40,298
Thanks.
That's my bed.

95
00:04:40,375 --> 00:04:44,141
Jan has some space issues,
so I curl up on that puppy.

96
00:04:44,279 --> 00:04:48,477
Really? 'Cause... It seems
pretty narrow and short.

97
00:04:48,583 --> 00:04:51,848
It's actually a lot bigger than it seems.
Look at this!

98
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:53,853
See?
He fits perfectly.

99
00:04:57,659 --> 00:04:59,149
I finally

100
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:01,956
broke down
and bought myself

101
00:05:02,030 --> 00:05:05,193
a plasma TV.

102
00:05:05,266 --> 00:05:08,599
Check it out. I actually hung
this on the wall myself.

103
00:05:08,670 --> 00:05:10,729
That's good. I want to
show you something.

104
00:05:10,805 --> 00:05:13,672
A lot of people in the room,
you need more space...

105
00:05:13,741 --> 00:05:15,709
VoilÃ .
Right into the wall.

106
00:05:15,777 --> 00:05:16,801
Wow!

107
00:05:16,878 --> 00:05:18,539
Sometimes, I will just

108
00:05:18,613 --> 00:05:22,014
stand here and watch television
for hours. I love it.

109
00:05:23,117 --> 00:05:26,951
I love this TV. And I
also built this table.

110
00:05:27,021 --> 00:05:28,852
What is that,
chestnut?

111
00:05:28,923 --> 00:05:31,016
No, I think that is either
pine or Nordic cherry.

112
00:05:31,092 --> 00:05:32,150
It's pine. Yeah.

113
00:05:32,226 --> 00:05:34,490
Michael, I'm just terrible at all
this stuff, so that's really cool.

114
00:05:34,562 --> 00:05:35,995
- Really?
- Yeah.

115
00:05:36,064 --> 00:05:40,694
Yeah, he tried to set up my TiVo for me,
but then I didn't have audio for a week.

116
00:05:40,768 --> 00:05:43,999
If you ever need any help,
I'm just a phone call away.

117
00:05:44,072 --> 00:05:45,266
I bet you are.

118
00:05:46,808 --> 00:05:48,298
Well, I saw...

119
00:05:48,376 --> 00:05:49,536
Oh, your Dundies.

120
00:05:49,610 --> 00:05:52,204
I'm surprised they're not out on the
coffee table for everybody to see.

121
00:05:52,347 --> 00:05:57,512
Well, it was between the neon
beer sign and the Dundies.

122
00:05:57,585 --> 00:05:59,712
So I said, "Honey,
keep the trophies."

123
00:05:59,787 --> 00:06:05,453
Oh, honey, I have the best trophy
right here. Aside from my Dundies.

124
00:06:06,994 --> 00:06:09,986
Oh, excuse us for just a second.
I'll get it.

125
00:06:10,064 --> 00:06:12,123
So glad we were finally
able to do this.

126
00:06:12,266 --> 00:06:13,927
So glad we...
No. No.

127
00:06:14,035 --> 00:06:16,128
Okay.
Tuna!

128
00:06:16,204 --> 00:06:19,105
What's up, Tuna? We gonna
have some tuna for dinner?

129
00:06:19,173 --> 00:06:21,835
I bet you're sick of tuna, right?
You probably have tuna every night.

130
00:06:21,909 --> 00:06:24,139
All right.
Tuna.

131
00:06:24,212 --> 00:06:26,578
These are for you.
Oh, how thoughtful.

132
00:06:26,647 --> 00:06:29,081
Very nice.
Except for one flower,

133
00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:31,641
which is for my flower.

134
00:06:31,719 --> 00:06:32,708
Aw.

135
00:06:32,954 --> 00:06:35,718
What am I supposed
to do with this?

136
00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:38,759
Well, how about we do the short
tour, and then I'll start dinner?

137
00:06:38,826 --> 00:06:41,522
Oh, I can help starting
dinner, if you need it.

138
00:06:41,596 --> 00:06:44,656
Oh no, no, no, it's just the Osso Buco,
needs to braise for about three hours.

139
00:06:44,732 --> 00:06:46,563
Everything else
is done.

140
00:06:46,634 --> 00:06:50,263
Three hours from now, or three
hours from earlier, like 4:00?

141
00:06:50,338 --> 00:06:54,434
You know, Pam, in Spain, they often
don't even start eating until midnight.

142
00:06:54,509 --> 00:06:56,568
When in Rome.

143
00:06:56,644 --> 00:06:58,441
You have a preference?
Upstairs first?

144
00:06:58,513 --> 00:06:59,537
Whatever
you say, babe.

145
00:06:59,614 --> 00:07:00,603
F'ollow me.

146
00:07:00,715 --> 00:07:01,773
All right.

147
00:07:04,318 --> 00:07:08,482
How about a toast? Shall I?
Here's to good friends.

148
00:07:08,556 --> 00:07:10,285
Cheers.
Cheers.

149
00:07:12,326 --> 00:07:13,452
Mmm.

150
00:07:15,196 --> 00:07:17,164
A sort of an
oaky afterbirth.

151
00:07:18,933 --> 00:07:19,957
What was that?

152
00:07:20,034 --> 00:07:22,434
Music? Should we turn
some music on?

153
00:07:22,503 --> 00:07:24,232
That sounds good.

154
00:07:24,305 --> 00:07:27,866
Do you guys remember
my old assistant, Hunter?

155
00:07:27,942 --> 00:07:32,538
He is an excellent songwriter. Wait
until you hear this. Okay, here we go.

156
00:08:10,351 --> 00:08:12,251
You know what? Hunter was
a terrible assistant.

157
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:13,446
That is why
Ryan fired him.

158
00:08:13,521 --> 00:08:15,546
Well, I think he's probably
just about as reliable as Pam,

159
00:08:15,623 --> 00:08:18,183
being that it usually takes you
an afternoon to get back to me.

160
00:08:18,259 --> 00:08:21,023
Sometimes I think
she holds on to faxes.

161
00:08:23,764 --> 00:08:27,165
I don't care what they say about me.
I just want to eat.

162
00:08:27,235 --> 00:08:30,170
Which I realize
is a lot to ask for

163
00:08:30,238 --> 00:08:31,933
at a dinner party.

164
00:08:32,006 --> 00:08:35,703
Cow. No, it's a hump,
there's a hump.

165
00:08:35,843 --> 00:08:36,969
Joe Camel! Joe Camel! Yes!

166
00:08:37,044 --> 00:08:39,308
Okay, yes. F'irst
name of that animal,

167
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:43,180
and the second name is the state
where Helena is the capital.

168
00:08:43,251 --> 00:08:44,878
Montana.
Joe Montana?

169
00:08:44,952 --> 00:08:46,681
Yes! Yes!

170
00:08:46,754 --> 00:08:48,688
Time's up! All
right, two pieces!

171
00:08:48,789 --> 00:08:50,416
Why didn't you just say
49ers quarterback?

172
00:08:50,558 --> 00:08:55,257
All right, my... my... my... my turn!
My... my... my... my turn!

173
00:08:55,329 --> 00:08:57,024
My... my... my... my turn!

174
00:08:57,098 --> 00:08:59,089
Babe, can you just, like, really...
What?

175
00:08:59,233 --> 00:09:00,962
You're just, like, really...

176
00:09:01,035 --> 00:09:02,400
What? What?

177
00:09:02,470 --> 00:09:04,062
Could you just simmer down?
Seriously.

178
00:09:04,138 --> 00:09:06,072
I'm just making people laugh.
No.

179
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:08,768
Yes, I was watching Jim's face.
I was watching Jim.

180
00:09:08,843 --> 00:09:10,868
And he was laughing.

181
00:09:11,078 --> 00:09:12,238
No smile.

182
00:09:12,313 --> 00:09:14,577
Look at him.
He's laughing.

183
00:09:14,682 --> 00:09:18,618
Michael and Jan seem to be
playing their own separate game.

184
00:09:18,686 --> 00:09:22,486
And it's called, "Let's see how
uncomfortable we can make our guests."

185
00:09:22,557 --> 00:09:26,391
And they're both winning. So I
am going to make a run for it.

186
00:09:27,695 --> 00:09:30,391
You'll never guess. I just got
a message from my landlord.

187
00:09:30,464 --> 00:09:32,091
Apparently,
my apartment flooded.

188
00:09:32,166 --> 00:09:33,861
Something with the sprinkler.
Oh, no!

189
00:09:33,935 --> 00:09:36,529
Pam, we should probably get
going and see the damage.

190
00:09:36,604 --> 00:09:37,628
Oh! Okay.

191
00:09:37,705 --> 00:09:40,037
Well, you don't need
two of you to do that.

192
00:09:42,343 --> 00:09:44,106
That's true...

193
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:47,106
Dinner sounded
delicious.

194
00:09:47,181 --> 00:09:48,910
Pam, I'll see you at home.
Thank you so much.

195
00:09:48,983 --> 00:09:52,316
Oh, Jim, I don't think you're going to
abandon this party here, all by itself.

196
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:54,283
I don't know, because
everything I own is there.

197
00:09:54,355 --> 00:09:57,449
You can buy new stuff, but
you can't buy a new party.

198
00:09:57,525 --> 00:10:01,086
That's true. That is a great point.
Come on down here.

199
00:10:02,997 --> 00:10:07,229
Sit down on that couch
and be amongst friends,

200
00:10:07,301 --> 00:10:10,793
and we're not gonna think about all
your stuff being destroyed. All right?

201
00:10:10,871 --> 00:10:11,963
Michael, you're up.

202
00:10:12,039 --> 00:10:13,700
Here we go.
This is gonna be fun.

203
00:10:13,808 --> 00:10:14,900
- Ready...
- Go!

204
00:10:14,976 --> 00:10:16,944
All right.
F'irst name is Tom.

205
00:10:17,011 --> 00:10:20,276
No, no, no. No names. No names,
no rhyming, no sound-alikes.

206
00:10:20,348 --> 00:10:22,714
All right, okay. Okay.
You're getting into my head!

207
00:10:22,783 --> 00:10:24,648
F'irst name is blank,
and he goes on a cruise.

208
00:10:24,719 --> 00:10:26,744
He goes on
a Caribbean cruise.

209
00:10:26,821 --> 00:10:28,049
I don't know.
Katie Holmes.

210
00:10:28,122 --> 00:10:31,250
No, but he's married to her!
Oh, Dawson's Creek.

211
00:10:31,325 --> 00:10:34,158
No, it has to be a real person, Jim.
Come on!

212
00:10:34,228 --> 00:10:36,890
No, no, I'm gonna pass.
I'm gonna pass.

213
00:10:37,932 --> 00:10:39,058
Okay!

214
00:10:39,133 --> 00:10:42,261
Rhymes with Parnold Sportsanegger.
No rhyming!

215
00:10:42,336 --> 00:10:43,769
Not really a rhyme.

216
00:10:43,838 --> 00:10:45,135
Another clue!
Another clue!

217
00:10:45,206 --> 00:10:47,504
Okay, he's the governor
of California.

218
00:10:47,575 --> 00:10:49,042
He is the Terminator.

219
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:50,600
Those aren't helpful.
Tom Cruise!

220
00:10:50,678 --> 00:10:51,736
No!
Time!

221
00:10:51,812 --> 00:10:54,576
God! Does anybody
read the paper?

222
00:11:04,392 --> 00:11:05,518
Oh, thank you.

223
00:11:05,593 --> 00:11:06,651
You're welcome.

224
00:11:17,238 --> 00:11:20,901
I'm so, so sorry for the
temperature in here.

225
00:11:22,109 --> 00:11:25,704
The sliding glass
door shattered.

226
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:27,213
So...
It's okay.

227
00:11:29,517 --> 00:11:31,212
It's actually
a really cute story.

228
00:11:31,285 --> 00:11:33,253
Do you want to tell it,
babe, or should I tell it?

229
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:34,344
I don't like
that story, babe.

230
00:11:34,422 --> 00:11:35,446
Come on!

231
00:11:35,523 --> 00:11:39,755
It's a cute story... Michael ran
through the sliding glass door

232
00:11:39,827 --> 00:11:42,819
because he thought he heard
the ice cream truck.

233
00:11:42,897 --> 00:11:44,228
Stop. Stop it!

234
00:11:44,365 --> 00:11:47,334
I mean, I like ice cream,
okay? Sue me.

235
00:11:47,401 --> 00:11:49,767
Oh, no, don't.

236
00:11:49,837 --> 00:11:52,567
I shouldn't say that jokingly,
because she will sue me.

237
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:56,576
She loves to sue.
She loves lawsuits.

238
00:11:56,644 --> 00:12:01,604
You know, honey, that door was extremely
clean, and it looked invisible.

239
00:12:01,682 --> 00:12:03,582
You are so right.
You are so right!

240
00:12:03,651 --> 00:12:06,916
Because before I lived here, the
glass was always covered in smudges.

241
00:12:06,987 --> 00:12:10,184
And I moved in and I cleaned it, so
I guess that makes me the devil.

242
00:12:11,659 --> 00:12:15,789
You are! She is! She is the devil!
I'm in hell!

243
00:12:16,797 --> 00:12:18,128
I'm burning.
Help me!

244
00:12:18,199 --> 00:12:19,530
You shouldn't
joke about that.

245
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,862
Is there more wine
in the kitchen?

246
00:12:20,935 --> 00:12:22,300
No, I will get it.
I will get it.

247
00:12:22,369 --> 00:12:24,200
What kind of hostess would I
be if I didn't get my wine?

248
00:12:24,271 --> 00:12:26,535
It's okay, I don't mind. No, no, no.
In fact, you know what?

249
00:12:26,607 --> 00:12:29,474
Girls' trip. Angela,
come on. Girls' trip.

250
00:12:32,413 --> 00:12:34,506
Oh, not even close.

251
00:12:34,582 --> 00:12:36,743
So, you keep
a very tidy house.

252
00:12:36,817 --> 00:12:39,911
You should see our bathroom
after Michael takes a bath.

253
00:12:41,422 --> 00:12:43,390
But I don't have
to tell you, Pam.

254
00:12:43,457 --> 00:12:45,220
Oh, yeah...

255
00:12:45,292 --> 00:12:46,384
What?

256
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:50,157
Oh, don't tell me that he's really
changed since you guys dated.

257
00:12:50,231 --> 00:12:51,562
Oh, are you joking?

258
00:12:51,632 --> 00:12:55,762
No, Michael told me a little bit about
it, but I see the way you look at him.

259
00:12:55,836 --> 00:12:58,168
I have never, ever dated

260
00:12:58,239 --> 00:13:02,608
or wanted to do anything
resembling dating Michael, ever.

261
00:13:02,676 --> 00:13:06,942
Not ever, not now, not then,
not now, not ever, ever.

262
00:13:07,014 --> 00:13:09,073
I've noticed how you look
at him at the office.

263
00:13:09,150 --> 00:13:10,139
Mmm-hmm.

264
00:13:13,788 --> 00:13:18,589
So, I spend most of my time right here.
Have a hand.

265
00:13:18,659 --> 00:13:21,127
So, Jim, I noticed you
checking out Jan's candles.

266
00:13:21,195 --> 00:13:23,186
Oh, no, she just put it
in front of my face.

267
00:13:23,264 --> 00:13:26,324
Yeah, did you know
that candles

268
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:30,302
are the number-one fastest-growing
product in the scent-aroma market?

269
00:13:30,371 --> 00:13:34,432
$2 billion a year industry.
And for only $10,000,

270
00:13:34,508 --> 00:13:38,308
you could become a co-owner
of "Serenity by Jan."

271
00:13:38,379 --> 00:13:41,041
What do you think about that?
Thought about it. I'm in.

272
00:13:41,115 --> 00:13:45,415
I'm sorry, are you really trying to
get us to invest in Jan's company?

273
00:13:46,187 --> 00:13:47,279
I'm sorry.

274
00:13:49,356 --> 00:13:50,516
What now?

275
00:13:51,592 --> 00:13:52,991
Coming.

276
00:13:53,861 --> 00:13:55,294
Hello.

277
00:13:55,362 --> 00:13:56,795
What are you
doing here?

278
00:13:56,864 --> 00:14:00,459
We came here to eat dinner and to party.
This is a dinner party, right?

279
00:14:00,534 --> 00:14:02,195
Awesome!
What is he doing here?

280
00:14:02,369 --> 00:14:03,666
Yes, what are
you doing here?

281
00:14:03,737 --> 00:14:05,261
Dwight is my friend.

282
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:08,137
We weren't invited?

283
00:14:08,209 --> 00:14:13,010
You said that I could not invite Dwight
because he was not part of a couple,

284
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:16,015
and because we didn't have
enough wine glasses.

285
00:14:16,116 --> 00:14:19,279
Dwight brought glasses
and a person.

286
00:14:19,353 --> 00:14:21,014
F'ine.
Whatever you want.

287
00:14:21,088 --> 00:14:22,646
Just like always.
Whatever you want.

288
00:14:22,723 --> 00:14:25,248
Whatever I want?
It's never whatever I want.

289
00:14:25,826 --> 00:14:28,488
It's fine, Michael. When
I wanted to see Stomp

290
00:14:28,562 --> 00:14:29,654
and you wanted
to see Wicked,

291
00:14:29,730 --> 00:14:31,493
what did we see?
We saw Wicked...

292
00:14:31,599 --> 00:14:34,432
When I said that
I wanted to have kids,

293
00:14:34,501 --> 00:14:38,164
and you said that you wanted me to
have a vasectomy, what did I do?

294
00:14:38,239 --> 00:14:40,707
And then, when you said that
you might want to have kids,

295
00:14:40,774 --> 00:14:43,709
and I wasn't so sure, who
had the vasectomy reversed?

296
00:14:43,777 --> 00:14:45,768
And then when you said you
definitely didn't want to have kids?

297
00:14:45,846 --> 00:14:47,177
Who had it reversed back?

298
00:14:47,248 --> 00:14:49,375
Snip, snap! Snip, snap!
Snip, snap!

299
00:14:49,450 --> 00:14:50,644
I did!
Okay...

300
00:14:50,718 --> 00:14:55,917
You have no idea the physical toll that
three vasectomies have on a person!

301
00:14:57,291 --> 00:14:59,191
And I bought this condo

302
00:14:59,260 --> 00:15:00,693
to fill with children.

303
00:15:00,761 --> 00:15:02,126
I am so sorry

304
00:15:02,196 --> 00:15:05,393
that I don't want to bring kids
into this screwed-up world.

305
00:15:05,466 --> 00:15:06,899
Okay? But look...
I'm sorry, too.

306
00:15:06,967 --> 00:15:11,267
- If you want to have kids, then fine, you win.
- Let's have a kid!

307
00:15:13,941 --> 00:15:16,569
Do you mean it?
You want to have a kid?

308
00:15:18,178 --> 00:15:19,509
I hate my life.

309
00:15:20,948 --> 00:15:22,643
So, can we come in?

310
00:15:30,224 --> 00:15:31,350
Mmm.

311
00:15:31,692 --> 00:15:33,660
Great turkey leg.

312
00:15:35,029 --> 00:15:37,657
Okay, I'm just gonna
check on dinner.

313
00:15:41,135 --> 00:15:43,262
Angela, would you like
some of my beet salad?

314
00:15:43,337 --> 00:15:44,804
I hate beet salad.

315
00:15:44,872 --> 00:15:46,396
It's actually
really good.

316
00:15:46,473 --> 00:15:48,338
Hey, hey, hey.

317
00:15:48,409 --> 00:15:51,435
I know you love beet salad. I've
seen you eat it many times.

318
00:15:51,512 --> 00:15:56,745
The thought of popping one of your beets
into my mouth makes me want to vomit.

319
00:15:56,817 --> 00:15:57,806
Pam...

320
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:02,587
I hope she didn't
do anything to the food.

321
00:16:03,457 --> 00:16:04,583
Like what?

322
00:16:04,658 --> 00:16:06,626
I can't prove it,

323
00:16:06,694 --> 00:16:09,663
but I think she might
be trying to poison me.

324
00:16:14,768 --> 00:16:15,928
Hey,
looks great, babe.

325
00:16:16,003 --> 00:16:17,197
Yeah,
it really does.

326
00:16:17,271 --> 00:16:20,536
I know Jan didn't poison the food.
I know that.

327
00:16:20,607 --> 00:16:23,838
But if she was going to poison the
food of someone at that table,

328
00:16:23,911 --> 00:16:27,108
wouldn't it be me?
Michael's former lover.

329
00:16:34,822 --> 00:16:37,450
Can you not do that?
It's disgusting.

330
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:42,094
You know I have soft teeth.
How could you say that?

331
00:16:42,262 --> 00:16:43,388
Oops.

332
00:16:45,966 --> 00:16:47,900
Excuse me
for a second.

333
00:16:52,606 --> 00:16:56,235
So, how do you guys
know each other?

334
00:16:57,711 --> 00:16:59,201
I was his babysitter.

335
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:02,043
And now you guys
are dating?

336
00:17:02,116 --> 00:17:05,051
Purely carnal, that's
all you need to know.

337
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:08,179
Would you write down your e-mail?
Because I have, just,

338
00:17:08,255 --> 00:17:10,314
so many questions.
E-mail?

339
00:17:12,359 --> 00:17:13,656
Never mind.
Okay.

340
00:17:15,229 --> 00:17:18,164
All right.
There we go.

341
00:17:26,473 --> 00:17:27,462
There.

342
00:17:31,145 --> 00:17:32,134
Okay.

343
00:17:32,212 --> 00:17:34,646
That's nice. Everybody
enjoying their meal?

344
00:17:37,151 --> 00:17:38,448
- Hey, babe.
- Yeah.

345
00:17:38,519 --> 00:17:40,885
How about we take the beer sign
down until our guests leave,

346
00:17:40,954 --> 00:17:42,012
and then we can
discuss it?

347
00:17:42,089 --> 00:17:46,719
No, no. I'm gonna leave it up. I think
it ties the whole room together.

348
00:17:47,995 --> 00:17:49,121
Okay.

349
00:17:55,169 --> 00:17:58,161
Jan thinks Hunter's
very talented.

350
00:17:58,238 --> 00:18:01,298
You know what? I don't
think he's that good.

351
00:18:01,375 --> 00:18:03,002
At least he's an artist.

352
00:18:03,077 --> 00:18:05,307
BF'D, I'm a screenwriter.

353
00:18:05,446 --> 00:18:08,540
And I'm a candle maker, but you
don't hear me bragging about it!

354
00:18:08,682 --> 00:18:13,449
No, all you do is you get me to
try to work on my rich friends.

355
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:15,613
F'or an investment
opportunity!

356
00:18:15,689 --> 00:18:18,214
Man, I would love
to burn your candles!

357
00:18:18,292 --> 00:18:19,850
You burn it,
you buy it!

358
00:18:19,927 --> 00:18:22,555
Oh, good, I'll be
your first customer!

359
00:18:22,629 --> 00:18:24,460
You're hardly my first.

360
00:18:24,531 --> 00:18:25,998
That's what she said!

361
00:18:37,578 --> 00:18:41,571
That is a $200 plasma screen
TV that you just killed!

362
00:18:41,648 --> 00:18:44,014
Good luck
paying me back

363
00:18:44,084 --> 00:18:47,952
on your zero-dollars-a-year
salary plus benefits, babe!

364
00:18:54,962 --> 00:18:56,122
I'm gonna get going.

365
00:18:56,196 --> 00:18:57,390
F'ine, get out of here.

366
00:18:57,464 --> 00:18:58,795
It's getting late.
We should...

367
00:18:58,866 --> 00:19:02,529
You know what, you guys? She'll
be out of the bathroom soon.

368
00:19:02,603 --> 00:19:03,627
Of course.

369
00:19:03,704 --> 00:19:06,298
Get out of my way.
I'll take care of this.

370
00:19:06,373 --> 00:19:08,341
Okay, what seems to be
the problem, Officers?

371
00:19:08,408 --> 00:19:10,808
Not now, Dwight. We got a
call about a disturbance.

372
00:19:10,878 --> 00:19:13,642
No. Nope.
Nothing disturbing here.

373
00:19:13,714 --> 00:19:16,444
Just a couple of friends having
an awesome dinner party.

374
00:19:16,583 --> 00:19:18,141
Your neighbors say
they heard some shouting.

375
00:19:18,218 --> 00:19:20,584
Yes, there was
screaming, but...

376
00:19:21,955 --> 00:19:26,187
My girlfriend threw a Dundie
at my TV, plasma.

377
00:19:27,094 --> 00:19:28,186
You want to
press charges?

378
00:19:28,262 --> 00:19:29,729
Would she get
into trouble?

379
00:19:29,796 --> 00:19:31,263
Yeah, she'd
be charged.

380
00:19:32,232 --> 00:19:35,224
I will take the fall.
I did it.

381
00:19:35,302 --> 00:19:39,432
You know, you don't have to press charges.
You could just try to be more quiet.

382
00:19:39,506 --> 00:19:41,565
Michael!
Yes.

383
00:19:41,642 --> 00:19:43,405
Wait, what are
you doing to him?

384
00:19:43,477 --> 00:19:45,468
Sir, do you have any other
place you could stay?

385
00:19:45,546 --> 00:19:48,379
Maybe with one
of your friends, here?

386
00:19:49,683 --> 00:19:51,446
Michael can come
home with me.

387
00:19:53,253 --> 00:19:54,277
Jim, Pam?

388
00:19:54,354 --> 00:19:55,912
Oh, my apartment's
on fire.

389
00:19:55,989 --> 00:19:57,183
F'looded.
F'looded.

390
00:19:57,257 --> 00:19:58,246
You people!

391
00:19:58,325 --> 00:20:00,054
Come on, you're sleeping with me.
No.

392
00:20:00,127 --> 00:20:01,958
I'm gonna take you home, Michael.
No.

393
00:20:03,630 --> 00:20:05,359
All right.

394
00:20:05,432 --> 00:20:06,694
Bye, babe!

395
00:20:06,833 --> 00:20:09,495
This is the best burger
I've ever had, babe.

396
00:20:09,570 --> 00:20:14,633
Babe, I should have told you, but...
I did something bad.

397
00:20:18,378 --> 00:20:20,972
I stole this.
F'or you, babe.

398
00:20:38,265 --> 00:20:39,459
One night

399
00:20:39,533 --> 00:20:40,966
I love that.
