1
00:00:34,654 --> 00:00:38,888
- Hey ya, may I help you on here ?
- I'm all set thank you.

2
00:00:38,996 --> 00:00:42,142
Good, I *go with the rows*.
That's a good idea.

3
00:00:42,424 --> 00:00:43,896
Today is diversity day,

4
00:00:43,897 --> 00:00:46,154
and someone is going to come in
and talk to us about diversity,

5
00:00:46,155 --> 00:00:48,395
something that I've been pushing,

6
00:00:48,627 --> 00:00:52,621
that I've been wanting to push for a
long time, and corporate mandated it,

7
00:00:52,706 --> 00:00:55,453
I never actually talked
to corporate about it,

8
00:00:55,585 --> 00:00:57,601
they kind of beat me with the punch,

9
00:00:58,325 --> 00:01:00,016
those bastards !

10
00:01:00,188 --> 00:01:05,575
But I was going to, and I think it's
very important that we have this,

11
00:01:05,895 --> 00:01:08,355
I'm very very excited.

12
00:01:08,935 --> 00:01:11,047
That's the thing,
it's a very sturdy paper,

13
00:01:11,095 --> 00:01:14,516
and on the back it says :
100% post customer contempt.

14
00:01:14,983 --> 00:01:21,028
What ? Hello, haha, wait what ?

15
00:01:21,518 --> 00:01:25,265
I'm sorry mister Decker,
I think I'm losing you.

16
00:01:25,635 --> 00:01:32,065
Hello ? Hello ? Yeah, hold on
one sec, hold on one second.

17
00:01:32,398 --> 00:01:35,018
- Do you really have to do that right now ?
- Yes I do.

18
00:01:35,035 --> 00:01:36,751
I should have done this
weeks ago actually.

19
00:01:36,844 --> 00:01:41,515
Mister Decker, I'm sorry about that,
would you wait one second ?

20
00:01:41,857 --> 00:01:45,538
Yeah, just one second. Thanks.

21
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:54,419
Hello ? That's it, perfect.
So what I was saying was... hello ?

22
00:01:57,075 --> 00:02:01,139
- Thanks Dwight.
- "Retaliation". Tit for tit.

23
00:02:01,342 --> 00:02:05,282
- That is not the expression.
- Well that should be.

24
00:02:11,169 --> 00:02:13,211
This is my bigger sale of the year.

25
00:02:13,264 --> 00:02:17,172
They love me over there, for some
reason, I'm not really sure why,

26
00:02:17,228 --> 00:02:20,591
but you know I make one call over there,
every year, just to renew their account.

27
00:02:20,718 --> 00:02:25,237
And that one call ends up being 25%
of my commission, for the whole year.

28
00:02:25,331 --> 00:02:29,415
So you know, I buy a mini bottle
of champagne, and celebrate.

29
00:02:29,473 --> 00:02:34,676
And this year, I'm pushing recycle
paper on them, for one percent more.

30
00:02:35,563 --> 00:02:40,569
I know, getting cocky right.

31
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:48,714
- Solitaire ?
- Yeah, free cell.

32
00:02:49,127 --> 00:02:51,709
- A 6 on 7.
- I know, I saw that.

33
00:02:51,850 --> 00:02:54,719
- So then why didn't you do it ?
- I'm saving that,

34
00:02:54,878 --> 00:03:01,836
- cause I like it when the cards go...
- Who doesn't love that ?

35
00:03:10,394 --> 00:03:14,201
- Hey ! Oscar, how you doing man ?
- All right.

36
00:03:14,228 --> 00:03:16,201
A good week end going there ?

37
00:03:16,625 --> 00:03:20,259
- It was fun.
- Oh yeah bet it was fun

38
00:03:21,422 --> 00:03:24,897
- Oh hey ! This is Oscar.
- Martinez.

39
00:03:25,044 --> 00:03:28,448
- See, I didn't even know, first thing basis.
- We're all set.

40
00:03:28,505 --> 00:03:31,641
Oh hey, diversity everybody let's do it.

41
00:03:32,270 --> 00:03:34,007
Oscar works in here.

42
00:03:34,065 --> 00:03:37,286
- Jim can you rapid up please ?
- Yeah.

43
00:03:38,094 --> 00:03:39,925
It's diversity day Jim,

44
00:03:39,990 --> 00:03:41,831
wish everyday was diversity day.

45
00:03:41,955 --> 00:03:45,176
You know what, I'm actually
gonna have to call you back.

46
00:03:45,341 --> 00:03:49,779
Thank you, sorry about that.

47
00:03:50,096 --> 00:03:54,308
- Thank you
- Get in the cars ! Get in the car !

48
00:03:54,423 --> 00:03:56,392
- Thank you. Thank you very much.

49
00:03:56,525 --> 00:03:59,210
Ok thanks for filling these,
I promise this will be quick.

50
00:03:59,225 --> 00:04:05,183
At diversity today our philosophy is about
honesty and positive expectations,

51
00:04:05,185 --> 00:04:10,871
we believe that 99% of the problems in the
workplace arise simply out of ignorance.

52
00:04:10,916 --> 00:04:13,765
You know what ? This is
a color free zone here.

53
00:04:13,766 --> 00:04:16,411
Stanley, I don't look
at you as another race.

54
00:04:16,425 --> 00:04:21,339
See, this is what I'm talking about, we
don't have to pretend that we're colorblind.

55
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:25,274
- Exactly. We're not colorblinds.
- That's fighting ignorance with
- With intolerance.

56
00:04:25,335 --> 00:04:30,562
No, with more ignorance. Right exactly.
Instead we need to celebrate our diversity.

57
00:04:30,612 --> 00:04:32,271
Let's celebrate.

58
00:04:32,365 --> 00:04:36,581
"Celebrate good times. Come on !"
Let's celebrate diversity right ?

59
00:04:36,652 --> 00:04:41,332
Yes, exactly. Now, here's what
we're gonna do, I've noticed that uh...

60
00:04:41,402 --> 00:04:43,283
You know what, here's
what we're gonna do.

61
00:04:43,294 --> 00:04:47,438
What if we go around and
everybody, everybody,

62
00:04:47,628 --> 00:04:52,892
say a race that you are attracted to
sexually, I will go last. Go.

63
00:04:53,018 --> 00:04:55,488
I have two.
White and Indian.

64
00:04:55,713 --> 00:04:58,109
Actually I prefer not to start that way.

65
00:04:58,214 --> 00:05:02,945
Michael I would love to have your permission
to run this session, can I have your permission ?

66
00:05:02,992 --> 00:05:04,766
- Yes.
- Thank you very much.

67
00:05:04,813 --> 00:05:07,208
And it would also help me
if you were seated.

68
00:05:07,215 --> 00:05:09,569
Thank you. Ok.

69
00:05:09,721 --> 00:05:13,381
Now, at the start of the session
I had you write down an incident

70
00:05:13,885 --> 00:05:16,122
that you found offensive
in the workplace.

71
00:05:16,152 --> 00:05:19,286
- Now what I'm gonna do is choose
one and we're gonna act like...
- A few other ground rules ?

72
00:05:19,298 --> 00:05:21,824
Why don't you run it by
me and I run it by him ?

73
00:05:22,022 --> 00:05:24,879
OK. Can we steer away from gay people ?

74
00:05:24,996 --> 00:05:28,144
I'm sorry it's an orientation,
it's not a race.

75
00:05:28,165 --> 00:05:31,882
Plus a lot of other racists
are also intolerant at gays so,

76
00:05:32,134 --> 00:05:33,086
paradox.

77
00:05:33,159 --> 00:05:34,550
Well we only have an hour.

78
00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:40,082
- Why don't we just refer to Mr. uh ?
- Mr. brown.

79
00:05:40,164 --> 00:05:42,135
Oh all right ! ok !

80
00:05:42,214 --> 00:05:44,238
First test, I will not call you that !

81
00:05:44,295 --> 00:05:46,355
Well it's my name it's not a test, ok ?

82
00:05:47,729 --> 00:05:51,001
So. Looking few cards I've noticed that
many of you wrote down the same incident,

83
00:05:51,005 --> 00:05:51,750
which is ironic,

84
00:05:51,774 --> 00:05:55,373
because it's the exact incident
I was brought in here to respond to.

85
00:05:55,385 --> 00:05:59,396
Now how many of you are familiar
with the Chris Rock routine ?

86
00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:03,287
Very good, ok.

87
00:06:03,391 --> 00:06:06,716
How come Chris rock can do a routine,

88
00:06:06,795 --> 00:06:10,240
and everybody finds it hilarious,
and ground breaking,

89
00:06:10,323 --> 00:06:13,994
and I go into the exact same
routine, same comedy timing,

90
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:17,009
and people file a
complaint to corporate ?

91
00:06:17,215 --> 00:06:20,346
Is it because I'm white,
and Chris is black ?

92
00:06:22,403 --> 00:06:25,166
So we're gonna reenact this
with a more positive outcome.

93
00:06:25,174 --> 00:06:27,135
I will play the Chris rock guy !

94
00:06:27,689 --> 00:06:29,403
I would like to see
someone else pull this off.

95
00:06:29,441 --> 00:06:32,095
Oh let's have someone who wasn't
involve in the reenactment ?

96
00:06:32,105 --> 00:06:35,046
Ok, I will play guy listening.

97
00:06:35,177 --> 00:06:36,565
Great, guy listening.

98
00:06:36,632 --> 00:06:39,270
- Ok anyone else remember ?
- I remember.

99
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:42,696
Great you're the Chris rock guy
and you're the guy listening.

100
00:06:42,774 --> 00:06:45,086
Kevin is a great guy,

101
00:06:45,105 --> 00:06:48,338
he's a great accountant, he is
not much of an entertainer.

102
00:06:48,535 --> 00:06:51,722
Basically, there are
two types of black people.

103
00:06:51,901 --> 00:06:54,992
And black people are
actually more racists,

104
00:06:55,064 --> 00:06:57,765
because they hate the
other type of black people.

105
00:06:58,016 --> 00:07:01,663
Every time the one type
wants to have a good time,

106
00:07:01,675 --> 00:07:05,165
then the other type comes in
and makes a real mess.

107
00:07:05,190 --> 00:07:10,983
Ok I'm sorry, I'm sorry he's ruining,
he's butchering it, could you just let me...

108
00:07:11,091 --> 00:07:15,551
Every time, every time black people
want to have a good time,

109
00:07:15,552 --> 00:07:19,994
some biiiip ass biiiip,
I take care of my kids !

110
00:07:19,995 --> 00:07:23,819
always want credit for
something they're supposed to do !

111
00:07:23,824 --> 00:07:25,923
Stop it !

112
00:07:29,674 --> 00:07:32,848
What do you want ? Cookie ?

113
00:07:37,571 --> 00:07:40,406
Now this is a simple acronym, H.E.R.O.

114
00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:43,902
At diversity today we believe
it's very easy to be a hero.

115
00:07:43,931 --> 00:07:48,498
All you need are Honesty, Empathy,
Respect and Open mindedness.

116
00:07:48,543 --> 00:07:53,764
- Excuse me ? I'm sorry but
that's not all it takes to be a hero.
- Oh great, what is a hero to you ?

117
00:07:53,810 --> 00:07:56,823
A hero kills people.
People that wish him harm.

118
00:07:56,905 --> 00:07:57,329
Ok.

119
00:07:57,358 --> 00:08:00,238
A hero is part human, part supernatural,

120
00:08:00,342 --> 00:08:05,192
a hero is born out of a child with
trauma, or out of a disaster,

121
00:08:05,328 --> 00:08:08,299
that must be avenged.

122
00:08:08,774 --> 00:08:14,830
- Ok, you're thinking of a superhero.
- We all have a hero in our heart.

123
00:08:15,587 --> 00:08:18,426
Now I need you to take these forms,

124
00:08:18,475 --> 00:08:21,979
this is the kind of expresses the
joint experience we had today.

125
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:28,220
and I want you to look them over and
sign them, as a kind of a group pledge.

126
00:08:29,957 --> 00:08:32,511
I don't think I can sign this.

127
00:08:32,558 --> 00:08:34,889
I can't leave until you do.

128
00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:36,541
It says here that I've learned something,

129
00:08:36,545 --> 00:08:40,030
and I knew all this stuff already so...

130
00:08:40,595 --> 00:08:43,210
You know I could sign something
that says that I taught something

131
00:08:43,211 --> 00:08:47,443
or that I helped you teach something
so, Pam, where's she ?

132
00:08:47,444 --> 00:08:53,316
- Pam could we change something on this ?
- Michael can I talk to you candidly ?

133
00:08:53,384 --> 00:08:57,506
- Sure.
- We both know that I'm here because
of the comments that you've made.

134
00:08:57,562 --> 00:09:01,263
Here's the thing, this office,
I think it's very advanced,

135
00:09:01,344 --> 00:09:06,300
in terms of racial awareness.

136
00:09:06,384 --> 00:09:08,985
And it's probably more advanced
than you're used to.

137
00:09:09,089 --> 00:09:12,639
- That's probably throwing you off.
- It's not throwing me, I need your signature.

138
00:09:12,659 --> 00:09:17,239
- Ok I know you told me that, several times.
- Yes, but you're not listening to me,

139
00:09:17,269 --> 00:09:19,921
- yours is the only signature I need.
- Oh ok.

140
00:09:19,985 --> 00:09:22,073
Those are my instructions
from the corporate offices

141
00:09:22,093 --> 00:09:25,852
is to put your through this seminar,
for the comments that you made,

142
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:32,156
and the only reason why I made copies for
everyone was that you wouldn't be embarrassed.

143
00:09:35,751 --> 00:09:41,884
Well here I am thinking that you
actually cared about diversity training,

144
00:09:42,186 --> 00:09:44,057
and you don't.

145
00:09:44,063 --> 00:09:47,125
- Don't worry about dating.
- I won't.

146
00:09:50,994 --> 00:09:53,351
- Ok thank you.
- Yep.

147
00:09:57,632 --> 00:10:01,208
I regret my actions, I regret
offending my co-workers.

148
00:10:01,276 --> 00:10:06,835
I pledge to bring my best spirit of honesty,
empathy, respect and open-mindedness,

149
00:10:06,844 --> 00:10:08,926
openmindedness is that a word ?

150
00:10:08,962 --> 00:10:13,206
Into the workplace, in this
way I can truly be a hero.

151
00:10:13,207 --> 00:10:16,514
Signed, daffy duck.

152
00:10:22,226 --> 00:10:25,279
He's gonna lose it when he reads that.

153
00:10:25,392 --> 00:10:27,391
Hi, is Mr. Decker around ?

154
00:10:27,552 --> 00:10:32,417
Oh well could you just have him
call me after lunch ? Thank you.

155
00:10:33,553 --> 00:10:43,553
I pledge to always keep an open
mind and an open heart.

156
00:10:49,644 --> 00:10:54,192
I do believe in that part of
the pledge that I just read,

157
00:10:54,275 --> 00:10:58,405
but a pledge, come on, who are we ?
The girls scouts ? No.

158
00:10:58,604 --> 00:11:05,000
Look, the, the guy Mister brown, he got
us half way there, he got us talking.

159
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:08,254
Well no, I got us talking.
It got us nothing,

160
00:11:08,288 --> 00:11:10,639
he insulted us and he abandoned us.

161
00:11:10,814 --> 00:11:13,788
You call that diversity training ?
I don't.

162
00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:16,512
Were there any connections
between any of us ?

163
00:11:16,525 --> 00:11:21,437
Did anyone look each other in the eye,
were there any emotion going on ?

164
00:11:21,547 --> 00:11:25,063
No ! Where was the heart,
I didn't see any heart,

165
00:11:25,087 --> 00:11:27,816
where was my Oprah moment ?

166
00:11:27,909 --> 00:11:33,831
Ok, get as much done as you can
before lunch, because afterward,

167
00:11:33,991 --> 00:11:37,481
I'm gonna have you all in tears.

168
00:11:48,929 --> 00:11:55,133
All right everybody pretty, come on,
here we go, it's time. Let's do some good.

169
00:11:55,290 --> 00:11:59,046
Hey we are not all gonna seat
in circle in it so are we ?

170
00:11:59,215 --> 00:12:01,957
- Get out !
- I'm sorry.

171
00:12:01,971 --> 00:12:05,543
No this not a joke, ok ?

172
00:12:05,663 --> 00:12:09,170
It was offensive, and lame,
so double offensive.

173
00:12:09,207 --> 00:12:17,022
This is an environment of welcoming and
you should just get the hell out of here.

174
00:12:17,143 --> 00:12:21,047
Ok let's go, let's do it come on
let's have some fun everybody.

175
00:12:21,121 --> 00:12:29,969
Here we go, take a seat, cop a squat,
and thank you for coming in.

176
00:12:31,445 --> 00:12:38,623
Diversity... is the cornerstone of
progress, as I've always said.

177
00:12:38,691 --> 00:12:43,373
But don't take my word for it.
Let's take a look at the tape.

178
00:12:47,913 --> 00:12:51,300
Hi I'm Michael Scott, I'm in charge
of Dundler Mifflin paper products

179
00:12:51,301 --> 00:12:53,100
here in Scranton, Pennsylvania.

180
00:12:53,524 --> 00:12:56,300
But I'm also the founder
of diversity tomorrow,

181
00:12:56,301 --> 00:12:58,750
because today is almost over.

182
00:13:01,257 --> 00:13:05,590
Abraham Lincoln once
said that if you're a racist

183
00:13:05,591 --> 00:13:08,900
I will attack you with the north.

184
00:13:09,083 --> 00:13:13,934
And those are the principles that
I carry with me in the workplace.

185
00:13:16,691 --> 00:13:20,560
Ok, questions ? Comments ?
Anybody, Jim ?

186
00:13:20,690 --> 00:13:24,460
- Uhh, is that it ?
- Yes I only had an hour to put it together,

187
00:13:24,488 --> 00:13:27,987
- but I'm gonna add onto it later on.
- It was kind of hard to hear.

188
00:13:28,034 --> 00:13:33,777
Uh yes that probably has something to do
with the camera work. Anybody else ?

189
00:13:33,843 --> 00:13:38,457
- I have a customer meeting.
- Yeah well if you leave we'll only have to...

190
00:13:38,553 --> 00:13:42,663
Yes, enjoy, absolutely.
"Namaste".

191
00:13:43,603 --> 00:13:45,997
Ok, well, since I am leading this

192
00:13:46,039 --> 00:13:51,808
let's get down to business, and why
don't I, just kind of introduce myself, ok ?

193
00:13:52,395 --> 00:14:00,341
I am Michael, and I am part
English, Irish, German, and Scottish,

194
00:14:00,528 --> 00:14:03,590
sort of a virtual United Nations.

195
00:14:03,713 --> 00:14:09,243
But what some of you might not know,
is that I am also part native American Indian.

196
00:14:09,395 --> 00:14:11,548
What part, native American ?

197
00:14:11,697 --> 00:14:14,831
- 2/15th
- That fraction doesn't make any sense.

198
00:14:14,866 --> 00:14:18,975
Well, you know what it's kinda hard
for me to talk about it. It's suffering

199
00:14:19,043 --> 00:14:22,896
So who else ? Let's get it popping,
come on. Whose gone ?

200
00:14:22,988 --> 00:14:26,799
Let's go here, Oscar,
right here, you're on !

201
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:32,820
Ok Michael, both my parents
were born in Mexico

202
00:14:33,230 --> 00:14:37,503
and they moved to the united-states
a year before I was born,

203
00:14:37,523 --> 00:14:42,660
so I grew up in the united states and
my parents were Mexicans.

204
00:14:42,803 --> 00:14:46,619
That is a great story, that's the
American dream right there, right ?

205
00:14:46,641 --> 00:14:48,677
Thank you, yeah

206
00:14:48,743 --> 00:14:54,759
Let me ask you is there a term
besides Mexican, that you prefer ?

207
00:14:54,934 --> 00:14:56,972
Something less offensive ?

208
00:14:57,016 --> 00:15:00,569
- Mexican isn't offensive !
- Well it has certain connotations.

209
00:15:00,647 --> 00:15:05,273
- Like what ?
- Like... I don't know

210
00:15:05,283 --> 00:15:06,973
- What connotations Michael ?
- No...

211
00:15:06,984 --> 00:15:09,340
- It must have been something
- No, remember

212
00:15:09,344 --> 00:15:14,353
- I'm just curious
- Honesty, Empathy, Respect,

213
00:15:14,363 --> 00:15:16,011
Jim ?

214
00:15:16,745 --> 00:15:19,126
Hello ?

215
00:15:21,005 --> 00:15:23,450
I have something here,
I want you to take a card

216
00:15:23,451 --> 00:15:26,250
put it on you fore...
don't look at the card !

217
00:15:26,286 --> 00:15:29,992
I want you to take the card, I want
you to put it on you forehead and

218
00:15:30,064 --> 00:15:33,231
take a card, any card

219
00:15:33,451 --> 00:15:37,898
and I want you to treat other
people like the race

220
00:15:37,995 --> 00:15:42,497
that is on their forehead.
So everybody has a different race

221
00:15:42,522 --> 00:15:46,621
nobody knows what
their race is, so

222
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:49,858
I want you to really go for it,
cause this is real

223
00:15:49,883 --> 00:15:53,420
you know this isn't just an
exercise this is real life and

224
00:15:53,454 --> 00:15:59,011
I have a dream that you
all really let this spark fly

225
00:15:59,613 --> 00:16:00,834
get it done !

226
00:16:01,690 --> 00:16:04,265
Why ? Because Martin Luther
King is a hero of mine

227
00:16:04,276 --> 00:16:09,350
There's this great Chris Rock bit about
how streets named after Martin Luther King,

228
00:16:09,352 --> 00:16:11,000
tend to be more violent.

229
00:16:12,402 --> 00:16:14,914
I'm not gonna do it but it's

230
00:16:15,135 --> 00:16:16,826
oh this is a good one

231
00:16:16,865 --> 00:16:20,304
- Hum, hi how are you ?
- Fine, how are you ?

232
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:22,985
- Push it
- Great

233
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:26,000
I admire your culture success in America.

234
00:16:26,001 --> 00:16:27,600
Thank you.

235
00:16:29,698 --> 00:16:34,904
Come on ! Olympics of sufferings right here
Slavery versus Holocaust, come on !

236
00:16:35,037 --> 00:16:37,091
- Whom am I supposed to be ?
- It's called role play

237
00:16:37,108 --> 00:16:40,620
well, that was an invert,
we didn't actually plan that

238
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:44,752
Lot's of cultures eat rice,
That doesn't help me

239
00:16:44,977 --> 00:16:50,039
- Shalom, I'd like to apply for a loan.
- That's nice, Dwight.

240
00:16:50,056 --> 00:16:52,640
OK, do me. Something stereotypical
so I can get it really quick.

241
00:16:52,641 --> 00:16:55,200
OK, I like your food.

242
00:16:55,421 --> 00:16:57,455
Uh, Outback Steakhouse,
I'm Australian, mate !

243
00:16:57,500 --> 00:17:00,485
- No...
- Pam..."I like your food"?

244
00:17:00,490 --> 00:17:04,292
No come on, stir the pot.
Stir the melting pot, Pam !

245
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:06,506
Let's do it, let's get ugly,
let's get real.

246
00:17:06,550 --> 00:17:09,300
OK, if I have to do this,

247
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:14,200
based on stereotypes that are totally
untrue, that I do not agree with,

248
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:17,400
you would maybe not be
a very good driver.

249
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:19,200
Aw man, am I a woman ?

250
00:17:20,144 --> 00:17:22,396
You'll notice, I didn't
have anybody being Arab.

251
00:17:22,468 --> 00:17:26,791
I thought that would be too
explosive, uh, no pun intended.

252
00:17:27,067 --> 00:17:29,900
But I just thought, "too soon" for Arabs.

253
00:17:29,902 --> 00:17:35,207
Maybe next year.
You know, the ball's in their court.

254
00:17:35,745 --> 00:17:36,965
- What's you're watching ?
- Supershow

255
00:17:37,114 --> 00:17:39,403
- really ?
- Yeah, I downloaded it on her computer

256
00:17:39,426 --> 00:17:44,525
- I hope she doesn't mind,
she has a lot of extra space.
- No way ! I think she really likes this stuff

257
00:17:44,615 --> 00:17:49,283
- she's cute hein ?
- Yeah, she's engaged but

258
00:17:49,417 --> 00:17:56,245
- oh, no, the girl on the... sketch
- oh, yeah, she's hot

259
00:17:56,383 --> 00:17:59,072
- Hey.
- Hey.

260
00:17:59,188 --> 00:18:03,038
- You wanna go to the beach ?
- Sure.

261
00:18:03,295 --> 00:18:06,488
- You wanna get high ?
- No.

262
00:18:06,838 --> 00:18:09,469
- I think you do, mon.
- Stop it

263
00:18:09,637 --> 00:18:15,543
you need to push it, you know
you could go a little bit further

264
00:18:18,678 --> 00:18:22,966
- Kelly, how are you ?
- I've had one of the longest meeting I've ever...

265
00:18:22,996 --> 00:18:26,827
Welcome to my convenient store.
Would you like some gookie cookie ?

266
00:18:27,015 --> 00:18:31,400
I have some very delicious gookie
cookie, only 99 cents plus taxes

267
00:18:31,469 --> 00:18:36,194
try my gookie cookie

268
00:18:46,555 --> 00:18:51,338
all right, yes

269
00:18:51,726 --> 00:18:54,499
that was great, she gets it

270
00:18:54,567 --> 00:18:59,024
now she knows what
it's like to be a minority.

271
00:19:02,928 --> 00:19:07,307
Mr. Decker, we didn't lose your
sell day do we ? Excellent, ok

272
00:19:07,396 --> 00:19:11,781
Let me just get your... what's that ?

273
00:19:12,023 --> 00:19:14,658
No we didn't close last time...

274
00:19:14,996 --> 00:19:17,567
I just need your...

275
00:19:17,966 --> 00:19:22,303
oh, what code were you given

276
00:19:23,026 --> 00:19:24,710
oh ok

277
00:19:24,958 --> 00:19:29,477
yeah, no that's actually another sells-man here,
yeah, I can re-do it if you want to do that

278
00:19:29,575 --> 00:19:32,472
oh he gave you discount ?
No, I don't blame you

279
00:19:32,895 --> 00:19:35,073
I just hated it when that guy was in here,

280
00:19:35,538 --> 00:19:38,832
Mr. brown ? If that was his real name!

281
00:19:38,924 --> 00:19:43,891
I mean, he had never met any of us before,
and here he was telling us how to do our things

282
00:19:44,395 --> 00:19:49,403
I just wanted to do it our way, you know ?

283
00:19:50,125 --> 00:19:51,714
On our own

284
00:19:53,615 --> 00:19:55,202
man I should have gotten some food

285
00:19:55,313 --> 00:20:00,748
- maybe some spaghetti
- ok, Kevin you can take off that thing, ok ?

286
00:20:01,325 --> 00:20:06,492
That would have really
showed him up, wouldn't it ?

287
00:20:06,546 --> 00:20:14,257
I've brought some burritos, some color
greens, some pad thai, love pad thai

288
00:20:14,335 --> 00:20:18,735
it's colored greens

289
00:20:18,805 --> 00:20:22,305
doesn't really make sense, cause
you don't call it colored people

290
00:20:22,344 --> 00:20:24,464
that's offensive

291
00:20:27,148 --> 00:20:33,094
ok, it's after five, so
thank you very much

292
00:20:33,214 --> 00:20:36,669
Buena vista Oscar
thank you

293
00:20:36,970 --> 00:20:40,782
good job
oh my man !

294
00:20:41,392 --> 00:20:46,479
Thank you brazil
nice

295
00:20:56,350 --> 00:21:01,303
hey, we can go

296
00:21:11,026 --> 00:21:16,151
not a bad day !
