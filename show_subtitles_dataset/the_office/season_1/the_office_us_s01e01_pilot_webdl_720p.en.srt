1
00:00:32,725 --> 00:00:36,054
All right Jim your
quarterlies look very good.

2
00:00:36,194 --> 00:00:38,335
How the thing is
going at the library ?

3
00:00:38,385 --> 00:00:40,518
Oh I told you
couldn't close it so…

4
00:00:40,625 --> 00:00:43,963
So you've come to the
master for…guidance ?

5
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:46,281
Is this what you're
saying grasshopper?

6
00:00:46,364 --> 00:00:49,000
Actually you call
me in here, but yeah.

7
00:00:49,645 --> 00:00:51,931
All right, well let me
show you how it's done.

8
00:00:52,045 --> 00:00:54,752
Yes, I liked to speak to
your office manager please…

9
00:00:54,795 --> 00:00:58,348
yes hello this is Michael
Scott, I am the regional manager

10
00:00:58,363 --> 00:01:00,253
of dundler Mifflin
paper products.

11
00:01:00,676 --> 00:01:03,435
Just wanted to talk to
you manager à manager.

12
00:01:06,382 --> 00:01:09,265
All right done deal,
thank you very much sir,

13
00:01:09,455 --> 00:01:11,049
you're a gentleman
in the scolar.

14
00:01:13,245 --> 00:01:16,968
Oh I'm sorry, ok,
I'm sorry, my mistake.

15
00:01:19,109 --> 00:01:24,170
That was a woman I was talking
to... she had a very low voice.

16
00:01:24,705 --> 00:01:26,264
Probably a smoker.

17
00:01:30,234 --> 00:01:31,579
So…so that's the
way it's done.

18
00:01:31,985 --> 00:01:34,995
I've been in Dundler
Mifflin for twelve years,

19
00:01:34,998 --> 00:01:37,423
the last four as
regional manager

20
00:01:37,765 --> 00:01:39,965
If you want to
come through here,

21
00:01:41,210 --> 00:01:43,032
so we have the
entire floor,

22
00:01:43,133 --> 00:01:45,323
so this is my kingdom,
as far as the eye can see,

23
00:01:45,604 --> 00:01:48,297
ah this is our
receptionist Pam.

24
00:01:48,374 --> 00:01:51,238
Pam, Pam Pam! Pam Beesly.

25
00:01:51,651 --> 00:01:53,632
Pam has been with us for…

26
00:01:53,765 --> 00:01:55,773
for ever, right Pam?

27
00:01:56,134 --> 00:01:57,077
Well, I don't know!

28
00:01:57,130 --> 00:01:58,372
If you think
she's cute now

29
00:01:58,423 --> 00:02:00,978
you should have seen her
a couple of years ago!

30
00:02:01,123 --> 00:02:01,580
What?

31
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:03,867
Any messages?

32
00:02:05,247 --> 00:02:06,583
Yeah, just a fax

33
00:02:08,622 --> 00:02:09,948
Pam this is
from corporate.

34
00:02:09,963 --> 00:02:11,604
How many times have I
told you that there's

35
00:02:11,624 --> 00:02:13,811
a special filing cabinet
for things from corporate.

36
00:02:13,865 --> 00:02:14,449
You haven't told me!

37
00:02:14,476 --> 00:02:16,352
It's called the
wastepaper basket.

38
00:02:19,186 --> 00:02:19,895
Look at that!

39
00:02:21,739 --> 00:02:22,791
Look at that face!

40
00:02:22,925 --> 00:02:24,598
People say I'm
the best boss.

41
00:02:25,545 --> 00:02:27,971
They go, "God we've never worked
in a place like this before,

42
00:02:28,005 --> 00:02:32,115
you're hilarious, and you
get the best out of us.”

43
00:02:35,177 --> 00:02:37,814
I think that pretty
much sums it up

44
00:02:38,983 --> 00:02:40,241
I found it at
Spencer Gifts.

45
00:03:00,277 --> 00:03:03,039
My job is to
speak to clients

46
00:03:03,137 --> 00:03:07,559
on the phone
about quantities

47
00:03:07,634 --> 00:03:12,320
and type of copier paper.

48
00:03:12,894 --> 00:03:15,812
You know, whether
we can supply to them

49
00:03:15,821 --> 00:03:21,450
whether they can
pay for it and...

50
00:03:25,201 --> 00:03:27,956
I'm boring myself just
talking about this.

51
00:03:36,195 --> 00:03:37,901
He still loves that
after seven years!

52
00:03:59,695 --> 00:04:00,015
What?

53
00:04:01,223 --> 00:04:01,719
Nothing

54
00:04:02,814 --> 00:04:05,123
Ok, all right.
See you later

55
00:04:05,135 --> 00:04:08,273
All right, take care.

56
00:04:09,031 --> 00:04:10,255
Back to work.

57
00:04:20,117 --> 00:04:23,374
Corporate really doesn't interfere
with me at all, Jan Levinson-Gould

58
00:04:23,375 --> 00:04:24,724
Jan, hello!

59
00:04:25,049 --> 00:04:28,341
I call her Hillary
Rodham Clinton, right?

60
00:04:28,403 --> 00:04:30,086
Not to her face because,

61
00:04:30,155 --> 00:04:34,346
not because I'm scared
of her, because I'm not

62
00:04:34,494 --> 00:04:35,607
but...

63
00:04:35,964 --> 00:04:36,697
yeah.

64
00:04:37,225 --> 00:04:39,534
All right, was it anything you
wanted to add to the agenda?

65
00:04:41,025 --> 00:04:43,451
Me no get an agenda.

66
00:04:44,210 --> 00:04:45,509
I'm sorry, what?

67
00:04:45,525 --> 00:04:46,689
I didn't get any agenda.

68
00:04:46,995 --> 00:04:48,874
Oh I faxed one
overdue this morning.

69
00:04:48,915 --> 00:04:52,931
Really? Cause I didn't…did
we get a fax this morning?

70
00:04:53,095 --> 00:04:54,934
Yeah, the one…

71
00:04:55,653 --> 00:04:58,799
Why isn't it in my hand?

72
00:04:58,864 --> 00:05:01,588
Because a company runs on
efficiency of communication, right?

73
00:05:02,955 --> 00:05:06,140
So what's the problem
Pam, why I didn't get it?

74
00:05:07,304 --> 00:05:10,919
You put it in the garbage can
that was a special filing cabinet.

75
00:05:14,973 --> 00:05:19,796
Yeah, that was a joke, that
was actually my brother's,

76
00:05:19,855 --> 00:05:23,911
it was supposed to be with bills
and doesn't work great with faxes.

77
00:05:23,912 --> 00:05:24,575
Do you want to
look at mine?

78
00:05:24,626 --> 00:05:26,808
Yeah. Thank you.

79
00:05:26,981 --> 00:05:30,529
Ok since the last meeting,
Alan and the board have decided

80
00:05:30,534 --> 00:05:33,240
that we can't justify Scranton
branch and the Stafford branch

81
00:05:33,245 --> 00:05:34,595
Oh ok…

82
00:05:34,619 --> 00:05:35,803
No, Michael don't panic

83
00:05:35,804 --> 00:05:38,138
No no no no this is
good, this is fine

84
00:05:38,141 --> 00:05:39,686
Michael listen,
don't panic

85
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:42,689
We haven't made
any decisions yet,

86
00:05:42,690 --> 00:05:45,466
I've spoken to Joshua in Stanford
I've told him the same as you

87
00:05:45,479 --> 00:05:48,762
and it's up to either you or him to convince
me that your branch can incorporate the other

88
00:05:48,774 --> 00:05:49,523
Ok no problem

89
00:05:49,534 --> 00:05:51,593
This does however mean that
there is going to be downsizing

90
00:05:51,595 --> 00:05:53,627
Me no wanna
hear that Jan,

91
00:05:54,155 --> 00:05:56,464
because downsizing
is a bitch,

92
00:05:56,495 --> 00:05:58,430
it is a real bitch,

93
00:05:58,933 --> 00:06:01,625
and I wouldn't wish
that on Joshua's men,

94
00:06:01,874 --> 00:06:03,961
I certainly wouldn't
wish it on my men,

95
00:06:04,023 --> 00:06:06,648
or women present
company excluded... sorry.

96
00:06:07,575 --> 00:06:10,066
is Josh concerned about
downsizing himself?

97
00:06:11,252 --> 00:06:13,862
Not downsizing himself but is
he concerned about downsizing?

98
00:06:19,233 --> 00:06:20,965
Question: how long
do we have to …

99
00:06:23,607 --> 00:06:26,193
Oh, Todd Paker, terrific
rep, do you mind if I take it?

100
00:06:26,195 --> 00:06:27,883
No, go ahead

101
00:06:28,036 --> 00:06:28,748
Pac man!

102
00:06:28,759 --> 00:06:30,315
Hey, you big queen

103
00:06:30,330 --> 00:06:32,214
Oh, that's
not appropriate

104
00:06:32,242 --> 00:06:34,662
Hey, is old god zillary
coming in today?

105
00:06:35,016 --> 00:06:36,146
I don't know
what you mean

106
00:06:36,152 --> 00:06:39,142
Look, I've been meaning to
ask her one question

107
00:06:39,472 --> 00:06:41,154
Does the carpet match
the drapes?

108
00:06:41,165 --> 00:06:42,282
Oh my god!

109
00:06:44,455 --> 00:06:49,548
That's so
horrifying! Horrible

110
00:06:50,285 --> 00:06:52,124
Horrible person!

111
00:06:53,012 --> 00:06:57,873
So do you think we can keep…a lid on this for
now I don't want to worry people unnecessarily.

112
00:06:57,895 --> 00:07:02,500
No, absolutely. Under this regime,
it will not leave this office.

113
00:07:03,621 --> 00:07:06,094
So what is downsizing
actually mean?

114
00:07:06,241 --> 00:07:06,884
Well

115
00:07:07,089 --> 00:07:09,999
You guys gotta update your
resume, just like I'm doing.

116
00:07:10,074 --> 00:07:13,576
I bet it's gonna
be me, probably.

117
00:07:14,142 --> 00:07:15,296
Yeah, it'll be you

118
00:07:15,405 --> 00:07:16,732
I have an important
question for you.

119
00:07:16,754 --> 00:07:17,353
Yes

120
00:07:18,695 --> 00:07:20,685
Are you going to Angela's
club party on Sunday?

121
00:07:20,714 --> 00:07:23,489
Yeah, stop.
That's ridiculous.

122
00:07:23,586 --> 00:07:26,737
Am I gonna tell them? No I'm not going to
tell them, I don't see the point of that.

123
00:07:26,965 --> 00:07:30,133
As a doctor you would not tell
a patient if they had cancer.

124
00:07:32,413 --> 00:07:33,366
This is Mister Scott.

125
00:07:35,628 --> 00:07:37,253
Ryan Howard from
the temp agency

126
00:07:37,841 --> 00:07:39,333
Deniqua sent me down to
start today

127
00:07:39,371 --> 00:07:41,806
Howard, like Moe
Howard, Three Stooges?

128
00:07:48,455 --> 00:07:52,294
Right here, my vibe. Oh
Pam, that's a guy thing Pam.

129
00:07:52,763 --> 00:07:54,596
I'm sort of a
student in comedy

130
00:08:05,145 --> 00:08:07,387
I'm Hitler, Adolf Hitler

131
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:12,644
I don't think it would be the
worst thing if they let me go.

132
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:15,245
Because then I might

133
00:08:15,869 --> 00:08:19,191
It's just, I don't think it's many
girls dream to be a receptionist.

134
00:08:20,345 --> 00:08:21,863
I like to do
illustrations,

135
00:08:23,934 --> 00:08:27,060
mostly water color,
a few oil pencil.

136
00:08:28,577 --> 00:08:30,349
Jim thinks they're good.

137
00:08:30,405 --> 00:08:32,024
Dundler Mifflin
this is Pam.

138
00:08:32,141 --> 00:08:34,927
Sure, Mr. Davis, let
me call you right back.

139
00:08:35,045 --> 00:08:38,285
Yeah, some just came up, two
minutes. Thank you very much.

140
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,073
Dwight, what
are you doing?

141
00:08:40,195 --> 00:08:40,498
- What?

142
00:08:40,507 --> 00:08:41,577
- What are you doing?

143
00:08:41,595 --> 00:08:43,755
Just clearing my desk,
I can't concentrate

144
00:08:43,768 --> 00:08:44,865
- It's not on your desk.

145
00:08:44,872 --> 00:08:45,638
- It's overlapping.

146
00:08:45,665 --> 00:08:47,263
It's all coming
over the edge.

147
00:08:47,774 --> 00:08:50,632
One word, two
syllables : demarcation.

148
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:00,277
- You can't do that.

149
00:09:00,455 --> 00:09:01,623
- Why not?

150
00:09:02,007 --> 00:09:06,425
Safety violation, I could
fall and pierce, and organ.

151
00:09:07,401 --> 00:09:08,657
We'll see

152
00:09:12,736 --> 00:09:15,612
This is why the whole downsizing
thing just doesn't bother me.

153
00:09:15,621 --> 00:09:17,097
Downsizing?

154
00:09:17,685 --> 00:09:22,558
I have no problem with that. I have been
recommending downsizing since Halpert got here

155
00:09:23,227 --> 00:09:24,992
even brought it
up on my interview.

156
00:09:25,496 --> 00:09:27,927
I say, bring it on!

157
00:09:28,645 --> 00:09:32,833
You just still have messages for
yesterday. Relax everything is under control

158
00:09:33,828 --> 00:09:36,705
Yeah, yeah, yeah oh
that's important, right.

159
00:09:36,826 --> 00:09:40,409
Oh, this is so important,
I should run to answer it.

160
00:10:00,479 --> 00:10:01,157
What?

161
00:10:01,359 --> 00:10:05,467
Come on. Six million
dollars man, Steve Austin,

162
00:10:05,705 --> 00:10:10,140
actually that would be a good salary for
me don't you think? Six million dollars?

163
00:10:10,318 --> 00:10:12,547
Memo to Jan: I
deserve a raise

164
00:10:13,301 --> 00:10:14,437
Don't we all?

165
00:10:14,643 --> 00:10:15,939
I'm sorry?

166
00:10:16,925 --> 00:10:18,070
There's nothing!

167
00:10:18,851 --> 00:10:23,302
If you are unhappy with your compensation,
maybe you should take it up with HR,

168
00:10:23,929 --> 00:10:28,787
ok? Not today, ok? Pam
just, be professional.

169
00:10:34,151 --> 00:10:37,503
I think I'm a role model here, I
think I garner other people respect.

170
00:10:37,576 --> 00:10:43,060
Attention on Dundler Mifflin employees, please
we have a meeting in the conference room ASAP

171
00:10:43,064 --> 00:10:47,999
People I respect, heros
of mine, would be Bob Hope,

172
00:10:50,704 --> 00:10:54,739
Abraham Lincoln,
definitely,

173
00:10:55,469 --> 00:10:58,271
Bono,

174
00:10:59,495 --> 00:11:04,057
and probably God
be the fourth one.

175
00:11:05,379 --> 00:11:12,923
And I just think all those people
really helped the world, in so many ways,

176
00:11:13,648 --> 00:11:18,990
that it's, it's
really beyond words.

177
00:11:21,085 --> 00:11:22,898
It's really uncalculable.

178
00:11:23,245 --> 00:11:26,541
Now, I know there's some rumors out
there, and I just kind want to see….

179
00:11:26,597 --> 00:11:28,351
I'm assistant regional
manager, I should know first.

180
00:11:28,385 --> 00:11:29,755
Assistant to the
regional manager.

181
00:11:29,997 --> 00:11:32,010
Ok. Can you just
tell me please?

182
00:11:32,193 --> 00:11:33,931
Just a whisper in my ear.

183
00:11:32,193 --> 00:11:33,931
I'm about to
tell everybody.

184
00:11:34,104 --> 00:11:36,048
I'm just about
to tell exeryone

185
00:11:36,132 --> 00:11:37,203
Please, ok.

186
00:11:37,271 --> 00:11:38,169
Do you want me
to tell them?

187
00:11:38,416 --> 00:11:40,018
You don't know
what it is!

188
00:11:40,845 --> 00:11:42,280
Can you tell them,
with my permission?

189
00:11:42,308 --> 00:11:43,351
I don't need your...

190
00:11:42,652 --> 00:11:43,915
Permission
granted. Go ahead

191
00:11:43,974 --> 00:11:49,646
Corporate has deemed it appropriate
to enforce an ultimatum upon me,

192
00:11:49,985 --> 00:11:55,582
and Jan is thinking about downsizing
either the Stanford branch or this branch.

193
00:11:55,637 --> 00:11:57,959
I heard they might be
closing this branch down,

194
00:11:58,156 --> 00:11:59,151
That's just...

195
00:12:00,692 --> 00:12:03,201
That's just the rumor going around this
is my first day I don't really know.

196
00:12:03,334 --> 00:12:05,251
Yeah, but Michael what
if they downsize here?

197
00:12:05,283 --> 00:12:06,526
Not gonna happen

198
00:12:06,594 --> 00:12:07,868
It could be out of
your hands, Michael

199
00:12:07,887 --> 00:12:10,903
It won't be out of
my hands, Stanley, ok?

200
00:12:11,045 --> 00:12:11,775
I promise you that.

201
00:12:11,909 --> 00:12:12,991
Can you promise that?

202
00:12:13,065 --> 00:12:14,339
On his mother's grave.

203
00:12:17,654 --> 00:12:23,057
Well yeah it is a promise, and frankly I'm a little
bit insulted that you have to keep asking about it.

204
00:12:23,144 --> 00:12:24,937
It's just that
we need to know

205
00:12:26,405 --> 00:12:29,538
Hold on a second, I think Pam
wanted to say something, Pam?

206
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:35,166
You had a look that you wanted
to ask a question, just then?

207
00:12:36,687 --> 00:12:41,611
I was in the meeting with Jan and she did said
that it could be this branch that gets the axe.

208
00:12:42,128 --> 00:12:43,299
Are you sure about that?

209
00:12:44,902 --> 00:12:50,243
Pam? Maybe you should stick to the ongoing
confidentiality agreement of meetings.

210
00:12:50,271 --> 00:12:52,676
Pam, information
is power.

211
00:12:53,005 --> 00:12:55,780
So you can't say for sure whether
it's gotta to be us or them.

212
00:12:55,805 --> 00:13:00,027
No no, no Stanley, no you did
not see me in there with her.

213
00:13:00,497 --> 00:13:07,958
I said, if corporate wants to come in here, and
interfere then they're gonna have to go through me, right?

214
00:13:08,041 --> 00:13:10,225
You know, you can go a
mess with Josh's people,

215
00:13:10,276 --> 00:13:12,047
but I'm the head
of this family,

216
00:13:12,174 --> 00:13:15,736
and you ain't gonna be
messing with my children.

217
00:13:22,327 --> 00:13:28,283
If I left, what would I do with all
this useless information in my head?

218
00:13:28,445 --> 00:13:32,228
You know, tonnage
price of minal folders?

219
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:36,727
Pam's favorite flavor of
yoghourt, which is mix berry.

220
00:13:41,117 --> 00:13:43,303
Jim said mix berries?

221
00:13:45,754 --> 00:13:47,236
Yeah he's under me

222
00:13:50,445 --> 00:13:53,384
Watch out for this guy Dwight
Schrute in the building!

223
00:13:53,421 --> 00:13:54,454
This is Ryan,
the new temp.

224
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:55,725
Nice to meet you.

225
00:13:55,748 --> 00:13:57,284
Introduce
yourself, be polite

226
00:13:57,341 --> 00:13:59,281
Dwight Schrute, Assistant
Regional Manager.

227
00:13:59,319 --> 00:14:01,274
Assistant to the
Regional Manager.

228
00:14:01,563 --> 00:14:06,006
So Dwight tell him about the kung
fu, and the car and everything.

229
00:14:07,201 --> 00:14:11,147
Yeah, I got a 78-2-8 <? daisy?>, I've bought her
for 1200, fixed it up, now worth three grand.

230
00:14:11,161 --> 00:14:12,267
That is his profit!

231
00:14:12,383 --> 00:14:15,652
New engine, suspension
I've got some photos

232
00:14:17,686 --> 00:14:18,840
Damn it!

233
00:14:19,399 --> 00:14:20,961
Ok, hold on,

234
00:14:21,105 --> 00:14:23,406
Judge is in cession.
What is the problem here?

235
00:14:23,617 --> 00:14:25,476
He put my stuff
in jello again.

236
00:14:28,576 --> 00:14:30,119
That's rough
professional, thanks

237
00:14:30,155 --> 00:14:32,446
That's the third time and it
wasn't funny the first time.

238
00:14:32,457 --> 00:14:37,452
It's ok here, but people some how is
taking advantage because it's so relaxed.

239
00:14:37,816 --> 00:14:41,381
I'm a volunteer sheriff's
deputy on the week ends,

240
00:14:41,870 --> 00:14:44,029
and you cannot
screw around there.

241
00:14:44,424 --> 00:14:46,481
It's one of the rules.

242
00:14:46,574 --> 00:14:47,091
What is that?

243
00:14:47,109 --> 00:14:48,095
That's my stapler.

244
00:14:48,103 --> 00:14:50,366
No no no, do
not take it out!

245
00:14:50,585 --> 00:14:51,673
You have to eat
it out there,

246
00:14:51,862 --> 00:14:53,767
because there are starving
people in the world,

247
00:14:53,793 --> 00:14:56,915
and which I hate, and it is
a waste of that kind of food.

248
00:14:56,632 --> 00:14:57,960
Ok, you know what?
You can be a witness.

249
00:14:57,975 --> 00:14:59,392
Can you reprimand
him please?

250
00:15:01,415 --> 00:15:02,420
- How do you
know it was me?

251
00:15:02,467 --> 00:15:03,496
- It's always you.

252
00:15:03,571 --> 00:15:04,773
- Are you gonna
discipline him or not?

253
00:15:04,786 --> 00:15:07,140
Ooh discipline, kinky!

254
00:15:07,467 --> 00:15:09,862
All right, here's
the deal you guys

255
00:15:10,056 --> 00:15:14,306
the thing about practical jokes, is that you have
to know when to start, as well as when to stop!

256
00:15:14,667 --> 00:15:22,262
And yeah, Jim, now is the time to stop
pulling Dwight's personal effects into jello.

257
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:29,091
Ok, Dwight I'm sorry because,
I've always been your biggest Flam

258
00:15:31,705 --> 00:15:34,898
Nice, that's the
way it is around here

259
00:15:35,977 --> 00:15:38,513
You should have put
him in custard-y!

260
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,337
Yes, new guy!

261
00:15:41,691 --> 00:15:43,216
He scores!

262
00:15:43,225 --> 00:15:44,873
Ok that's great, I guess,

263
00:15:44,898 --> 00:15:46,667
what I'm most
concerned with is...

264
00:15:46,992 --> 00:15:48,566
damage to
company property.

265
00:15:49,173 --> 00:15:50,192
That's all.

266
00:15:54,485 --> 00:15:57,077
Pudding…

267
00:15:57,470 --> 00:16:00,729
I'm trying to think,
another desert to do.

268
00:16:02,289 --> 00:16:05,111
Do you like to going out at
the end of a week for a drink?

269
00:16:05,795 --> 00:16:06,537
Yeah!

270
00:16:06,699 --> 00:16:10,014
Oh, that's why we all going out, so
we can have an end of the week drink!

271
00:16:10,095 --> 00:16:11,139
well then when
are we going out?

272
00:16:11,139 --> 00:16:12,501
I don't know,
tonight, hopefully.

273
00:16:12,501 --> 00:16:14,167
Ok, yeah.

274
00:16:17,068 --> 00:16:17,554
Hey man!

275
00:16:17,599 --> 00:16:18,098
Hey!

276
00:16:18,029 --> 00:16:18,927
What's going on?

277
00:16:18,995 --> 00:16:19,645
Hey baby!

278
00:16:20,390 --> 00:16:24,104
Roy is my fiancé, we've
been engaged about...

279
00:16:24,866 --> 00:16:28,940
about 3 years, and we were supposed
to get married in September,

280
00:16:29,315 --> 00:16:32,012
but I think we'll gonna
get married in next spring

281
00:16:33,105 --> 00:16:35,784
Do you mind if I go out
for a drink with these guys?

282
00:16:36,957 --> 00:16:40,018
No, come on. Let's get
out of here and go home.

283
00:16:40,398 --> 00:16:43,598
Ok, I will be out in a
few minutes so it's lame

284
00:16:44,198 --> 00:16:47,521
twenty past five I've
still to do my faxes.

285
00:16:51,239 --> 00:16:53,402
You know you
should come with us,

286
00:16:53,733 --> 00:16:56,597
because you know we are going out and
it could be a good chance for you to

287
00:16:56,978 --> 00:17:00,111
see what people are like outside
the office, I think it could be fun

288
00:17:00,375 --> 00:17:03,915
No, it sounds good but
seriously we gotta get going

289
00:17:03,935 --> 00:17:04,514
Yeah

290
00:17:16,357 --> 00:17:18,438
What's in the bag?

291
00:17:19,972 --> 00:17:20,736
Just tell her I'll
talk to her then

292
00:17:20,737 --> 00:17:23,995
No definitely all right
dude awesome, we'll do

293
00:17:27,804 --> 00:17:32,289
Do I think I'll be
invited to the wedding?

294
00:17:39,459 --> 00:17:42,291
So, have you
felt vibe yet?

295
00:17:42,587 --> 00:17:44,016
We work hard,
we play hard.

296
00:17:44,083 --> 00:17:46,775
Sometimes we play hard when we
should be working hard, right?

297
00:17:47,767 --> 00:17:52,865
I guess the atmosphere that I've
created here is that I am a friend first,

298
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:54,416
and a boss second.

299
00:17:54,692 --> 00:17:57,352
Probably an
entertainer third.

300
00:17:57,385 --> 00:17:58,131
Just a second

301
00:17:58,724 --> 00:17:59,435
Right?

302
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:04,826
Oh, hey do you like the
Jamie Kennedy Experiment?

303
00:18:04,867 --> 00:18:05,133
Yeah

304
00:18:05,153 --> 00:18:06,813
Punk'd, and all
that kind of stuff?

305
00:18:07,956 --> 00:18:10,393
You are going to be my complice,
just go on with that ok?

306
00:18:10,423 --> 00:18:10,708
All right

307
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:13,121
Just follow my lead,
don't pimp me all right?

308
00:18:13,241 --> 00:18:14,035
Come in!

309
00:18:14,352 --> 00:18:17,215
So corporate just said
that I don't want to…

310
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:17,552
…you got a fax

311
00:18:17,296 --> 00:18:18,605
Oh thank you Pam

312
00:18:18,606 --> 00:18:20,726
Pam? Can you come
in here for a sec?

313
00:18:21,274 --> 00:18:25,530
Just have a seat, I was gonna
call you in anyway, you know Ryan?

314
00:18:27,033 --> 00:18:30,460
As you know, there is
going to be downsizing

315
00:18:30,544 --> 00:18:35,052
and you have made my
life so much easier,

316
00:18:35,532 --> 00:18:39,524
in that I'm going to
have to let you go first

317
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:41,387
What? Why?

318
00:18:41,669 --> 00:18:44,927
Why? Well, theft,
and stealing

319
00:18:45,068 --> 00:18:46,167
Stealing?

320
00:18:46,899 --> 00:18:49,988
What am I suppose
to have stolen?

321
00:18:50,289 --> 00:18:51,669
Post-It notes.

322
00:18:52,318 --> 00:18:52,947
Post-It notes...?

323
00:18:53,609 --> 00:18:55,036
Worth of those
like 50 cents?

324
00:18:56,012 --> 00:18:58,775
You steal a thousand Post-It
notes at 50cents a piece,

325
00:18:58,790 --> 00:19:02,319
then you know you've
made a profit margin.

326
00:19:03,502 --> 00:19:05,215
Resell of business Pam

327
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:06,582
- Are you serious?

328
00:19:07,972 --> 00:19:08,926
- Yeah.

329
00:19:11,013 --> 00:19:12,962
I can't believe
this, I mean,

330
00:19:12,975 --> 00:19:17,241
I have never even stolen as much as
a paper clip and you're firing me.

331
00:19:17,945 --> 00:19:20,158
And the best thing
about it is that

332
00:19:20,465 --> 00:19:23,327
we are not gonna have to
give you any severance pay,

333
00:19:24,058 --> 00:19:27,806
because that is
gross misconduct, and…

334
00:19:28,131 --> 00:19:31,031
just clean out your
desk. I'm sorry.

335
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:50,773
You've been X'd punk'd!

336
00:19:50,867 --> 00:19:54,863
Surprise it's a joke, we
were joking around, you see?

337
00:19:55,069 --> 00:19:59,117
Ok, he was in on he
was my accomplice and

338
00:19:59,327 --> 00:20:01,860
It was kind of a morale
booster thing, and

339
00:20:01,965 --> 00:20:08,157
we were showing the new guy around the
kind of, giving him the field to play, so…

340
00:20:09,550 --> 00:20:11,409
God, you were, we
totally got you…

341
00:20:11,419 --> 00:20:12,783
…you're a jerk

342
00:20:14,025 --> 00:20:16,324
Well, I don't
know about that

343
00:20:31,524 --> 00:20:34,546
What is the most important
thing for a company?

344
00:20:34,622 --> 00:20:38,645
Is it the cash flow?
Is it the inventory?

345
00:20:38,971 --> 00:20:42,720
No it's the people.

346
00:20:43,066 --> 00:20:44,945
The "people".

347
00:20:45,513 --> 00:20:49,879
My proudest moment here was not
when I increased profits by 17%,

348
00:20:50,047 --> 00:20:54,186
or when I cut expenses without
losing a single employee.

349
00:20:54,203 --> 00:20:55,564
No, no, no, no.

350
00:20:55,863 --> 00:20:58,611
It was a young
Guatemalan guy,

351
00:20:58,924 --> 00:21:01,762
a first job in the country,
barely spoke English,

352
00:21:01,989 --> 00:21:04,007
came to me and said

353
00:21:04,505 --> 00:21:05,700
"Mr Scott,

354
00:21:06,714 --> 00:21:11,558
would you be the
Godfather to my child?"

355
00:21:20,932 --> 00:21:23,817
Didn't work out in the end. We
had to let him go. He sucked.

356
00:21:29,843 --> 00:21:31,117
Hey

357
00:21:31,141 --> 00:21:33,208
Hey how are you?

358
00:21:33,555 --> 00:21:35,943
Good I thought you were
going out for a drink with…

359
00:21:35,963 --> 00:21:37,340
Oh no

360
00:21:40,379 --> 00:21:41,290
How's your headache?

361
00:21:41,874 --> 00:21:43,016
Better, thanks.

362
00:21:42,323 --> 00:21:43,575
Good

363
00:21:47,233 --> 00:21:48,543
Are you

364
00:21:49,372 --> 00:21:50,310
Walking out?

365
00:21:50,175 --> 00:21:51,142
Yes

366
00:21:51,794 --> 00:21:53,302
Yes do you wanna?

367
00:21:53,590 --> 00:21:54,243
Yeah

368
00:21:54,277 --> 00:21:55,349
Great, let me just

369
00:21:56,925 --> 00:21:57,853
Oh Roy

370
00:21:57,855 --> 00:22:00,176
Yeah, listen have
a nice week-end!

371
00:22:00,257 --> 00:22:03,468
Yeah definitely
you too! Enjoy it

372
00:22:17,258 --> 00:22:18,051
Come here

373
00:22:26,949 --> 00:22:29,126
The World's Best Boss
