1
00:00:32,386 --> 00:00:34,084
Pam ! Pamela,

2
00:00:34,161 --> 00:00:36,929
Pamelamela Ding Dong !
Making copies.

3
00:00:37,837 --> 00:00:39,978
- I'm not making any copies.
- Let's go !

4
00:00:40,306 --> 00:00:43,462
Messages, date, lots to do lots to do...

5
00:00:43,597 --> 00:00:44,850
Information superhighway !

6
00:00:44,944 --> 00:00:46,444
- Nothing new...
- Let them unw...

7
00:00:46,482 --> 00:00:48,763
- There's nothing new.
- That's not what you said earlier.

8
00:00:49,016 --> 00:00:52,235
Oh do you want me to repeat
the messages that I gave you before ?

9
00:00:52,294 --> 00:00:53,315
For the...

10
00:00:57,075 --> 00:01:02,522
The most sacred thing I do is care,
and provide for my workers, my family.

11
00:01:02,815 --> 00:01:04,258
I give them money.

12
00:01:04,376 --> 00:01:05,773
I give them food.

13
00:01:06,789 --> 00:01:08,808
Not directly, but through the money...

14
00:01:09,853 --> 00:01:11,838
I heal them.

15
00:01:12,849 --> 00:01:17,142
Today I am in charge, of picking
a great new healthcare plan.

16
00:01:17,734 --> 00:01:19,730
Right ? That's what this is all about !

17
00:01:21,918 --> 00:01:24,487
Does that make me their doctor ?

18
00:01:26,986 --> 00:01:29,281
Yes... In a way...

19
00:01:30,089 --> 00:01:31,923
Yeah, like a specialist.

20
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:37,896
So which health plan
have you decided on ?

21
00:01:38,131 --> 00:01:40,268
I am going to go with best, Jan.

22
00:01:40,444 --> 00:01:42,464
I am going to go with the one with

23
00:01:42,522 --> 00:01:45,634
the acupuncture, therapeutic massage...

24
00:01:45,739 --> 00:01:47,912
- You know, the works...
- Wait acupuncture ?

25
00:01:48,006 --> 00:01:49,379
None of the plans have acupuncture.

26
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:51,568
Have you looked at
them closely Michael ?

27
00:01:52,673 --> 00:01:56,336
I think it was you who didn't look
closely enough at the "gold plan".

28
00:01:57,070 --> 00:01:58,445
- The gold plan ?
- Yep.

29
00:01:58,749 --> 00:02:00,100
I'm not even on that plan.

30
00:02:00,147 --> 00:02:02,260
Well I recommend it, it's very good.

31
00:02:05,677 --> 00:02:08,166
- You have to crack this things open.
- You know the whole reason we're doing

32
00:02:08,213 --> 00:02:10,103
this, is to save money.

33
00:02:10,925 --> 00:02:11,900
So,

34
00:02:11,952 --> 00:02:14,547
you just need to pick a provider,
and then choose the cheapest plan.

35
00:02:16,752 --> 00:02:18,523
Well that is...

36
00:02:18,977 --> 00:02:21,114
kind of a tough assignment.

37
00:02:22,582 --> 00:02:26,257
- It's not gonna be a popular
decision around the old orifice.
- It's your job... so

38
00:02:26,656 --> 00:02:28,220
It's a suicide mission, you know...

39
00:02:29,606 --> 00:02:31,027
- Michael,
- I, I Know

40
00:02:31,097 --> 00:02:32,882
- Maybe, I, I mean...
- There... there

41
00:02:32,952 --> 00:02:34,488
You know sometimes a manager...

42
00:02:35,177 --> 00:02:35,987
like yourself,

43
00:02:36,081 --> 00:02:39,205
has to deliver the bad news to
the employees, I do it all the time.

44
00:02:39,693 --> 00:02:42,316
- Yeah, when have you ever done that ?
- I'm doing it, right now.

45
00:02:43,391 --> 00:02:44,741
To you.

46
00:02:46,672 --> 00:02:48,340
Last night on "Trading spouses"...

47
00:02:49,044 --> 00:02:51,027
- There's... have you seen it ?
- No, I have a life.

48
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:54,187
- Interesting, what's that like ?
- You should try it sometime.

49
00:02:54,357 --> 00:02:55,555
Wow

50
00:02:56,036 --> 00:02:57,610
- But then who would watch my TV ?

51
00:02:57,668 --> 00:02:58,549
So I like that

52
00:02:58,655 --> 00:03:00,122
Ding Dong !

53
00:03:05,383 --> 00:03:06,865
There's a decision
that needs to be made.

54
00:03:06,899 --> 00:03:09,225
And I'm having a unbelievably busy day.

55
00:03:10,316 --> 00:03:12,981
So, I'm going to let you pick

56
00:03:13,239 --> 00:03:15,271
a healthcare plan for our office,

57
00:03:15,394 --> 00:03:17,331
and then explain it

58
00:03:17,613 --> 00:03:19,198
to your co-workers.

59
00:03:20,343 --> 00:03:21,889
- Gosh !
- Yeah !

60
00:03:22,832 --> 00:03:25,532
That is a great offer. Thank you.

61
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:30,539
I really think I should be
concentrating on sales.

62
00:03:30,635 --> 00:03:32,140
- Really ?
- Yeah.

63
00:03:32,815 --> 00:03:35,381
I just don't thing that this is
the kind of task, that

64
00:03:35,969 --> 00:03:38,752
I am going to do...

65
00:03:38,849 --> 00:03:40,739
You know who would be great for this ?

66
00:03:40,874 --> 00:03:44,685
Anytime Michael asks me to do anything
I just tell me that Dwight should do it.

67
00:03:45,389 --> 00:03:48,331
Yes ! I can do it ! I'm your man.

68
00:03:48,543 --> 00:03:50,485
Right now this is just a job.

69
00:03:50,839 --> 00:03:54,377
If I advance any higher in this company,
then this would be my career.

70
00:03:54,813 --> 00:03:56,241
And a...

71
00:03:56,318 --> 00:03:58,768
Well if this were my career,

72
00:03:59,559 --> 00:04:01,469
I'd have to throw myself
in front of a train.

73
00:04:02,029 --> 00:04:05,067
Ok first, let's go over some parameters,

74
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:07,225
how many people can I fire ?

75
00:04:07,566 --> 00:04:10,180
None, you're picking
a healthcare plan.

76
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:14,575
Ok we'll table that for the time being.
Two, I'm gonna need an office.

77
00:04:14,683 --> 00:04:16,057
I think the conference
room should be fine.

78
00:04:16,173 --> 00:04:19,013
You can use the conference
room as a temporary workspace.

79
00:04:19,167 --> 00:04:21,600
Yes, I have an office.

80
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:24,387
- Bigger than his !
- No, you cannot use it.

81
00:04:24,461 --> 00:04:27,519
- Ok I take it back it's a workspace.
- Temporary workspace, you can use it.

82
00:04:28,705 --> 00:04:29,766
Thank you.

83
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:34,161
If Dwight fails and that is
strike too and good for me,

84
00:04:34,912 --> 00:04:36,814
for giving him a second chance.

85
00:04:37,349 --> 00:04:39,862
And if he succeeds, then, you know,

86
00:04:39,985 --> 00:04:42,394
no one would be prouder than
I am. I've groomed him.

87
00:04:42,578 --> 00:04:44,463
I made him what he is today.

88
00:04:46,429 --> 00:04:49,160
Unless he fails and,

89
00:04:49,499 --> 00:04:52,023
talked about that already.

90
00:04:55,089 --> 00:04:57,432
What did I do ? I did my job.

91
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:01,074
I slashed benefits to the bone.
I saved this company money.

92
00:05:01,472 --> 00:05:05,466
Was I too harsh ? Maybe.
I don't believe in coddling people.

93
00:05:06,189 --> 00:05:09,042
In the wild, there is no healthcare.

94
00:05:09,308 --> 00:05:12,632
In the wild healthcare is
"How, I hurt my leg...

95
00:05:12,951 --> 00:05:15,671
I can't run, a lion eats me,
and I'm dead. "

96
00:05:16,819 --> 00:05:19,366
Well, I'm not dead.

97
00:05:20,176 --> 00:05:21,893
I'm the lion.

98
00:05:22,916 --> 00:05:24,633
You're dead !

99
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,787
There's no dental, there's no vision,

100
00:05:30,942 --> 00:05:33,141
there is a 1200 dollars deductible.

101
00:05:36,536 --> 00:05:37,829
Dundler Mifflin this is Pam.

102
00:05:37,983 --> 00:05:40,221
Pam, Michael Scott, how's tricks ?

103
00:05:40,945 --> 00:05:43,202
Where are you ?

104
00:05:43,491 --> 00:05:46,405
Oh, I'm in my office, I am swamped.

105
00:05:46,578 --> 00:05:49,009
I have work up to my ears

106
00:05:49,057 --> 00:05:53,157
and busy busy busy, can't step away,
I just wanted to check in and

107
00:05:53,297 --> 00:05:56,282
see how everybody's dealing.
Everybody cool out there ?

108
00:05:56,784 --> 00:05:58,809
Actually, people are really unhappy

109
00:05:59,427 --> 00:06:01,240
Dwight send around this memo

110
00:06:01,298 --> 00:06:04,067
- And people are freaking out cause...
- Pam, you, I'm sorry I'm sorry

111
00:06:04,124 --> 00:06:06,478
I, I, I got to go I'm getting a call.

112
00:06:06,989 --> 00:06:08,977
No you're not.

113
00:06:10,269 --> 00:06:13,153
I have to make a call
after I finish, my work

114
00:06:13,221 --> 00:06:15,941
You know what ?
Don't let anybody in my office

115
00:06:16,124 --> 00:06:20,321
Under any conditions today I'm just
too busy, too swamped, you know ?

116
00:06:21,401 --> 00:06:24,594
I'm unreachable.
I'm incommunicado capisce ?

117
00:06:24,739 --> 00:06:25,915
- Ok
- Thank you,

118
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:29,706
God here we go again, got to go,
I have to take this.

119
00:06:29,957 --> 00:06:31,443
Still no one calling.

120
00:06:36,073 --> 00:06:38,176
- Dwight, what is this...
- Uh, knock, please.

121
00:06:38,668 --> 00:06:41,266
- Please knock, this is an office.
- It says workspace.

122
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:42,902
- Same thing.
- If it's the same thing,

123
00:06:42,948 --> 00:06:45,289
then why'd you write "work space".

124
00:06:45,857 --> 00:06:49,419
Just knock, please, as a sign of
respect for your superior.

125
00:06:49,486 --> 00:06:52,303
- You are not my superior.
- Gee, then why do I have an office ?

126
00:06:52,409 --> 00:06:55,013
- Thought it was a workspace, Dwight.
- Ok, Dwight.

127
00:06:55,930 --> 00:06:57,898
Are you really in charge of
picking an healthcare plan ?

128
00:06:57,975 --> 00:06:59,499
Yes. And my decision is final.

129
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:01,843
This is a ridiculously awful plan.

130
00:07:02,065 --> 00:07:04,168
Because you cut everything.

131
00:07:04,351 --> 00:07:07,490
- Times are tough, Pam, deal with it.
- You cut more than you had to, didn't you ?

132
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:07,980
Sure.

133
00:07:08,026 --> 00:07:10,766
Then why did you do that ? You work
here, don't you want good insurance ?

134
00:07:10,872 --> 00:07:13,350
Don't need it, never been sick,
perfect immune system.

135
00:07:13,486 --> 00:07:16,679
Ok well if you've never been sick,
then you don't have any antibodies.

136
00:07:16,795 --> 00:07:19,245
I don't need them, superior genes.

137
00:07:19,313 --> 00:07:22,129
I'm a Schrute...
And superior brain power.

138
00:07:22,245 --> 00:07:25,718
Through concentration I can raise

139
00:07:27,512 --> 00:07:29,499
Why would you want to
raise your cholesterol ?

140
00:07:29,576 --> 00:07:31,602
So I can lower it.

141
00:07:33,078 --> 00:07:35,600
He literally won't
come out of his office.

142
00:07:36,194 --> 00:07:38,393
He's got to come out sometime.

143
00:07:40,399 --> 00:07:43,872
- To go to the bathroom.
- Kevin, that's inappropriate !

144
00:07:47,972 --> 00:07:49,862
Michael can I talk to you ?

145
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:52,949
I would like to, but I'm
really busy, rain check ?

146
00:07:53,789 --> 00:07:55,882
Michael, Michael please

147
00:07:56,364 --> 00:07:58,293
Can we talk about this memo ?

148
00:07:58,428 --> 00:08:01,091
- What ? Which memo ?
- Dwight's healthcare memo

149
00:08:01,207 --> 00:08:02,750
- I told you about it.
- Is it a good plan ?

150
00:08:02,856 --> 00:08:05,036
It's a great plan !
It saves the company a fortune.

151
00:08:05,190 --> 00:08:08,104
- It's like a paid decrease.
- Michael, he made huge cuts.

152
00:08:08,239 --> 00:08:11,268
Cuts ? what ?
Dwight did you make cuts ?

153
00:08:11,364 --> 00:08:14,432
- Yeah you said go in the...
- No no no no no. You know what ?

154
00:08:14,924 --> 00:08:17,277
I said nothing specific
because I was so busy.

155
00:08:17,499 --> 00:08:19,737
Why don't you go in there Dwight ?

156
00:08:19,843 --> 00:08:23,162
and find these people a
plan that will work for them. Ok ?

157
00:08:23,364 --> 00:08:26,123
- I can handle it.
- Ok. All right.

158
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:29,789
We feel good ? All right, good !

159
00:08:32,673 --> 00:08:34,506
Plus,

160
00:08:34,589 --> 00:08:36,953
There's some other good news.

161
00:08:37,384 --> 00:08:39,483
Today at the end of the day,

162
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:42,213
I will have for all of you

163
00:08:43,399 --> 00:08:45,965
a big surprise. Ok ?

164
00:08:46,129 --> 00:08:49,100
So hang in there, and I will
see you at the end of the day.

165
00:08:50,422 --> 00:08:51,888
Right ?

166
00:08:59,856 --> 00:09:01,727
- This is not good.
- It's ridiculous.

167
00:09:02,239 --> 00:09:04,399
Did you talk to him ?

168
00:09:04,563 --> 00:09:05,567
What was that ?

169
00:09:05,663 --> 00:09:07,910
You let him off all over
you it's just pathetic.

170
00:09:08,065 --> 00:09:10,724
- What are you guys talking about ?
- Nothing Kevin.

171
00:09:11,206 --> 00:09:13,824
Do I know what the surprise is ?
Hell no !

172
00:09:13,969 --> 00:09:17,075
Doesn't matter, the point is,
they're not unhappy anymore.

173
00:09:17,181 --> 00:09:20,229
They're out there thinking "Wow !
My boss really cares about me.

174
00:09:20,576 --> 00:09:23,084
He has a surprise, he's cool.

175
00:09:23,721 --> 00:09:26,306
What a great guy, I love him.

176
00:09:28,052 --> 00:09:29,981
I love him. "

177
00:09:32,007 --> 00:09:34,689
Ok everyone, gather' round.

178
00:09:37,544 --> 00:09:39,300
Step forward.

179
00:09:41,210 --> 00:09:44,200
It has been brought to my attention that
some of you are unhappy with my plan,

180
00:09:44,296 --> 00:09:45,666
so what I'd like you to do,

181
00:09:45,782 --> 00:09:48,319
is to fill this out and write
down any diseases that you have,

182
00:09:48,406 --> 00:09:50,991
That you might want covered
and I'll see what I can do.

183
00:09:51,049 --> 00:09:53,852
Okay you know what Dwight ? We can't
write our diseases down for you,

184
00:09:53,855 --> 00:09:55,641
- because that's confidential.
- Ok,

185
00:09:55,776 --> 00:09:58,149
well I didn't say to write
your name down, did I ?

186
00:09:58,303 --> 00:10:00,116
Fill that out, leave it anonymous.

187
00:10:00,203 --> 00:10:02,692
Or don't write any disease down at
all, and they won't be covered.

188
00:10:02,846 --> 00:10:04,911
Sound fair ? Good. All right,
I'll be in my office.

189
00:10:05,432 --> 00:10:07,014
Workspace.

190
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:10,149
You know what ? Come with me.

191
00:10:10,255 --> 00:10:12,223
We are going on a little mission.

192
00:10:12,319 --> 00:10:14,345
"Operation surprise. "

193
00:10:15,975 --> 00:10:18,039
Where are you going ?

194
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:20,788
Headed out. Part of my busy day.

195
00:10:20,856 --> 00:10:23,163
You know, meetings.

196
00:10:25,776 --> 00:10:27,300
Couldn't find the knock.

197
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:33,107
So basically, I want to do
something nice for my employees.

198
00:10:33,618 --> 00:10:35,779
Atlantic City. Ok ?

199
00:10:35,972 --> 00:10:38,615
They have this thing
where they send a bus,

200
00:10:38,779 --> 00:10:40,592
Right for free, picks everybody up,

201
00:10:40,698 --> 00:10:43,612
and head down there, get to
the hotel, the room is count.

202
00:10:43,814 --> 00:10:46,187
They give you a big pile
of chips, and your food.

203
00:10:46,341 --> 00:10:50,600
Everything just kind of a all
inclusive free kind of weekend.

204
00:10:50,776 --> 00:10:52,496
I don't know of anything like that.

205
00:10:52,776 --> 00:10:56,354
But, you know what you might want to
do is just call the casino directly,

206
00:10:56,624 --> 00:10:58,727
- Maybe.
- Yep yep, yep.

207
00:10:59,817 --> 00:11:01,882
I did, so.

208
00:11:13,573 --> 00:11:15,271
Wait what are you writing ?

209
00:11:15,367 --> 00:11:17,682
Don't write Ebola, or mad cow disease.

210
00:11:18,136 --> 00:11:20,007
All right ?

211
00:11:20,161 --> 00:11:22,341
Cause I'm suffering from both of them.

212
00:11:23,248 --> 00:11:25,332
- I'm inventing new diseases.
- Oh great.

213
00:11:25,390 --> 00:11:28,457
So let's say that my
teeth turn to liquid

214
00:11:28,747 --> 00:11:31,062
And then, they drip down
the back of my throat.

215
00:11:31,178 --> 00:11:32,354
What would you call that ?

216
00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:34,149
I thought you said you
were inventing diseases ?

217
00:11:34,284 --> 00:11:36,734
That's spontaneous
"dentohydroplosion"

218
00:11:37,679 --> 00:11:39,435
- Nice.
- Thank you.

219
00:11:39,522 --> 00:11:41,914
Calling to ask you a little
favor Rooney my friend.

220
00:11:43,081 --> 00:11:46,631
I'm trying to give the troops
around here a little bit of a boost

221
00:11:46,747 --> 00:11:48,444
And I was thinking that

222
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:52,168
maybe we could take them down
to take a spin on your big ride.

223
00:11:53,634 --> 00:11:56,586
You mean the elevator that
takes you down in the mine shaft ?

224
00:11:56,711 --> 00:11:58,332
It's not really a ride.

225
00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:01,091
It says here that it's a...

226
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:03,473
300 foot drop.

227
00:12:03,763 --> 00:12:06,927
Well that goes 300 feet in the
earth but it moves really slowly.

228
00:12:08,509 --> 00:12:10,457
So it's not a free fall ?

229
00:12:10,602 --> 00:12:12,975
It's a industrial coal elevator.

230
00:12:15,039 --> 00:12:17,489
All right. Once you get
down into the mine,

231
00:12:18,657 --> 00:12:21,319
what, you got laser tag or something ?

232
00:12:21,425 --> 00:12:24,647
OK ok so I don't know what
the surprise is, am I worried ?

233
00:12:24,792 --> 00:12:27,415
Nooo. No way.
You see I thrive on this.

234
00:12:27,772 --> 00:12:31,091
This is my world, this is improv,
this it "whose line is it anyway".

235
00:12:32,211 --> 00:12:37,143
Damn it ! damn it ! Jim !

236
00:12:37,216 --> 00:12:39,725
All right, who did this ?

237
00:12:39,849 --> 00:12:42,087
I'm not mad, I just want to know
who did it, so I can punish them.

238
00:12:42,165 --> 00:12:43,438
What are you talking about ?

239
00:12:43,804 --> 00:12:47,354
"Someone", forged medical
information, and that is felony.

240
00:12:47,615 --> 00:12:50,750
Ok "wow", cause that is
a pretty intense accusation.

241
00:12:50,817 --> 00:12:53,287
How do you know that they're fake ?

242
00:12:53,538 --> 00:12:55,544
Uh, Leprosy ?

243
00:12:56,325 --> 00:12:58,525
Flesh eating bacteria.

244
00:12:59,538 --> 00:13:01,544
Hot dog fingers.

245
00:13:02,489 --> 00:13:05,788
Government created
killer nano robot infection

246
00:13:07,775 --> 00:13:09,068
- You did this didn't you ?
- Absolutely not.

247
00:13:09,145 --> 00:13:10,129
- Yes you did.
- No I didn't.

248
00:13:10,187 --> 00:13:12,001
I know it was you.
Ok fine, you know what ?

249
00:13:12,049 --> 00:13:14,036
I'm gonna have to interview
each and everyone of you

250
00:13:14,267 --> 00:13:16,930
Until the perpetrator
makes him or herself known.

251
00:13:17,075 --> 00:13:20,788
And until that time, there will be
no healthcare coverage for anyone.

252
00:13:24,531 --> 00:13:28,930
- Killer Nano Robots ?
- It's an epidemic.

253
00:13:31,166 --> 00:13:35,277
The problem Jim, is that people
who are really suffering

254
00:13:35,446 --> 00:13:38,581
from a medical condition,
won't receive the care they need,

255
00:13:38,690 --> 00:13:43,175
because someone in this office has
coming up with all those ridiculous stuff

256
00:13:44,996 --> 00:13:47,721
- "Count Choculitis. ".
- Sounds tough.

257
00:13:47,866 --> 00:13:50,241
Why did you write that down Jim ?

258
00:13:50,518 --> 00:13:52,641
- Is it because you know I love Count Chocula ?
- Do you ?

259
00:13:54,238 --> 00:13:56,920
I think you need to confess the fact.

260
00:13:57,188 --> 00:13:58,525
- Yeah.
- What are you doing ?

261
00:13:58,694 --> 00:14:00,261
- What ?
- Those are my keys.

262
00:14:00,394 --> 00:14:02,661
- Good luck.
- Jim ! Damn it !

263
00:14:02,872 --> 00:14:06,628
No ! Jim let me out. Jim, let...

264
00:14:06,990 --> 00:14:09,827
The light green is a green.

265
00:14:16,117 --> 00:14:17,545
- Jim Halpert.
- Let me out.

266
00:14:17,661 --> 00:14:19,532
- Who is this ?
- Let me out or you're fired.

267
00:14:19,667 --> 00:14:22,628
- No, you can't fire me.
- Yes I can, I'm manager for the day.

268
00:14:22,763 --> 00:14:24,037
Clean out your desk.

269
00:14:24,075 --> 00:14:26,603
Ok, can you hold on one
second, I'm getting a bip.

270
00:14:29,603 --> 00:14:31,532
- Jim Halpert.
- Hey Jim, it's Pam.

271
00:14:31,599 --> 00:14:34,011
Hey Pam !
How are you ?

272
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:35,429
- Jim open the door !
- Good. How are you ?

273
00:14:35,487 --> 00:14:36,760
- I'm doing ok,
- Busy ?

274
00:14:36,818 --> 00:14:38,699
- Getting excited for the week end now.
- Yeah.

275
00:14:38,757 --> 00:14:41,265
- Yeah, what are you up to ?
- I'm not bothering you am I ?

276
00:14:41,410 --> 00:14:43,279
- No not all.
- You don't have anything you're doing.

277
00:14:43,356 --> 00:14:44,822
- I have nothing to do.
- Oh great.

278
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:47,697
Yeah no, this week end nothing
I'm not really doing anything.

279
00:14:47,822 --> 00:14:50,022
- Might go to the mall.
- The mall ?

280
00:14:50,186 --> 00:14:53,274
- I need new shoes.
- How interesting, what kind of shoes ?

281
00:14:54,206 --> 00:14:55,911
- Hello ?
- Hello.

282
00:14:56,070 --> 00:14:59,176
This is Dwight Schrute
calling for Jan Levinson-Gould.

283
00:14:59,629 --> 00:15:01,327
This is Jan.

284
00:15:01,356 --> 00:15:04,732
Hi, Dwight Schrute calling,
acting manager Scranton branch,

285
00:15:05,031 --> 00:15:07,867
Listen I need your permission
to fire Jim Halpert.

286
00:15:08,359 --> 00:15:10,636
- Who is this ?
- Dwight Schrute.

287
00:15:11,562 --> 00:15:13,395
- From sales ?
- Well.

288
00:15:13,481 --> 00:15:17,031
- Where is Michael Scott ?
- He is not here right now.

289
00:15:17,108 --> 00:15:19,790
He put me in charge of the office.

290
00:15:20,156 --> 00:15:23,648
Dwight, listen to me very carefully,
you are not a manager of anything.

291
00:15:23,803 --> 00:15:27,102
- Understand ?
- That's not entirely true,

292
00:15:27,584 --> 00:15:30,227
Because he put me in charge
of picking a healthcare plan.

293
00:15:30,922 --> 00:15:32,272
- Really ?
- Yeah.

294
00:15:32,369 --> 00:15:33,102
Ok.

295
00:15:33,169 --> 00:15:35,465
when Michael gets back, you tell
him to call me immediately.

296
00:15:35,523 --> 00:15:36,816
- Call you immediately, good.
- Yes.

297
00:15:37,221 --> 00:15:39,632
Listen, since I have you on the phone,

298
00:15:41,118 --> 00:15:43,337
- Can I fire Jim ?
- No.

299
00:15:43,529 --> 00:15:45,613
Please don't use my
cell phone ever again.

300
00:15:45,690 --> 00:15:47,349
This is your cell, I thought
this was your off...

301
00:15:55,085 --> 00:15:58,028
Everybody ice cream sandwiches.

302
00:15:58,761 --> 00:16:01,616
There you go take one
take one it's all good.

303
00:16:01,712 --> 00:16:03,680
Phyllis, safe pass.

304
00:16:04,433 --> 00:16:06,786
I see Angela right, Angela !

305
00:16:08,561 --> 00:16:10,915
Hey, temp, why don't you take two.

306
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:14,706
Because you don't get healthcare,
and faster metabolism.

307
00:16:14,928 --> 00:16:17,629
Did you get the kind with
the cookies, instead of the ?

308
00:16:17,745 --> 00:16:20,079
Why don't you just eat it ?
Ok.

309
00:16:20,166 --> 00:16:23,031
Here you go Stanley the "manly" !

310
00:16:23,436 --> 00:16:24,574
- Thanks.
- There you go.

311
00:16:24,613 --> 00:16:26,291
This isn't the big surprise is it ?

312
00:16:26,446 --> 00:16:28,799
Because we've been having
a pretty horrible day.

313
00:16:28,934 --> 00:16:31,192
Nope, nope.

314
00:16:31,278 --> 00:16:32,745
This isn't the surprise.

315
00:16:32,822 --> 00:16:35,909
It's surprising, because
you didn't expect it.

316
00:16:36,458 --> 00:16:39,265
But you'll, you'll know
it when you see it.

317
00:16:40,905 --> 00:16:43,201
Michael, Michael !

318
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:58,216
I tried being rational.
Ok, and what happened ?

319
00:16:58,351 --> 00:17:01,094
The employees went crazy,
I got no hope from corporate,

320
00:17:01,290 --> 00:17:03,068
so that leaves me with no options.

321
00:17:03,249 --> 00:17:05,570
I'm now gonna read aloud your
submitted medical conditions.

322
00:17:05,886 --> 00:17:09,082
When you hear yours read, please raise
your hand, indicate that it is real

323
00:17:09,293 --> 00:17:12,217
If you do not raise your hand,
it will not be covered.

324
00:17:12,337 --> 00:17:14,870
- What about confidentiality ?
- You know what ?

325
00:17:15,049 --> 00:17:19,209
You have forfeited that privilege.
I have tried to treat you all as adults.

326
00:17:19,451 --> 00:17:22,254
But obviously, I'm the only adult here.

327
00:17:22,434 --> 00:17:26,172
Number one, inverted penis.

328
00:17:30,452 --> 00:17:35,215
Could you mean vagina ?
Because if you do I want that covered.

329
00:17:35,441 --> 00:17:38,168
I thought your vagina was removed
during you hysterectomy.

330
00:17:38,319 --> 00:17:42,931
A uterus is different from a
vagina. I still have a vagina.

331
00:17:57,314 --> 00:18:01,421
Ok great. "Germatitus".
Thank you Angela,

332
00:18:01,571 --> 00:18:07,411
I'll make sure that's covered. Ok now,
who wrote this, this hysterical one ?

333
00:18:07,826 --> 00:18:10,464
- Anal fissures.
- That's a real thing.

334
00:18:10,670 --> 00:18:13,836
Yeah but no one here has it.

335
00:18:15,154 --> 00:18:18,108
Someone has it.

336
00:18:29,017 --> 00:18:31,852
- Do you think we should go.
- I don't know, Kevin this is important.

337
00:18:31,862 --> 00:18:33,145
I don't want futileness.

338
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:36,644
- What is he doing ?
- I don't know.

339
00:18:45,989 --> 00:18:47,513
Well ?

340
00:18:47,668 --> 00:18:49,192
Well, what ?

341
00:18:49,317 --> 00:18:52,057
- You could be referring to anything.
- Ok,

342
00:18:52,346 --> 00:18:53,542
The healthcare plan.

343
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:56,156
Why did you put Dwight in charge
of that, he did an horrible job.

344
00:18:56,475 --> 00:18:58,365
Dwight ?

345
00:18:58,539 --> 00:19:00,922
- Did you raise benefits ?
- I most certainly did not.

346
00:19:01,674 --> 00:19:03,777
come on ! That's horrible !

347
00:19:05,253 --> 00:19:07,607
Thanks Dwight for a crappy plan.

348
00:19:08,793 --> 00:19:10,105
Damn.

349
00:19:11,697 --> 00:19:14,166
I wish I had time to change it, but...

350
00:19:14,484 --> 00:19:17,774
Jan needs it by five and...
What time is it ? What time is it ?

351
00:19:18,266 --> 00:19:20,774
It's after five.

352
00:19:21,150 --> 00:19:23,542
It's awful.

353
00:19:23,639 --> 00:19:26,041
So well, ok.

354
00:19:26,253 --> 00:19:28,877
See you guys on Monday.

355
00:19:29,639 --> 00:19:31,732
What about the surprise ?

356
00:19:32,098 --> 00:19:34,230
Yes exactly.

357
00:19:34,346 --> 00:19:37,298
Thank you Angela
for reminding me.

358
00:19:38,214 --> 00:19:39,787
Terrific.

359
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:42,044
Before I tell everybody
what the big surprise is,

360
00:19:42,516 --> 00:19:45,854
would you like to tell me,
what you think the big surprise is ?

361
00:19:46,983 --> 00:19:49,182
We all think you don't have a surprise.

362
00:19:49,259 --> 00:19:52,867
All right, I have some news for you.
There is a big surprise.

363
00:19:54,256 --> 00:19:57,082
And... here it is, here we go...

364
00:19:57,324 --> 00:19:58,944
And

365
00:19:59,098 --> 00:20:01,934
the big surprise is...

366
00:20:04,452 --> 00:20:05,841
Drum roll.

367
00:20:25,992 --> 00:20:29,677
When I am backed into a corner,
that is when I come alive.

368
00:20:30,449 --> 00:20:33,304
See I learned improv
from the greats, like...

369
00:20:34,288 --> 00:20:36,217
Drew Carey and Ryan Styles.

370
00:20:48,989 --> 00:20:52,018
Robin Williams, oh man, would
I love to go head to head with him.

371
00:20:53,484 --> 00:20:56,089
That would be exciting !
"Hi, I'm Mork from Ork. "

372
00:20:56,388 --> 00:20:58,896
"Well I'm Bork for Smork".

373
00:20:59,019 --> 00:21:01,815
"anounanouzoubliblublu"

374
00:21:29,626 --> 00:21:31,769
Jan wants you to call her.
