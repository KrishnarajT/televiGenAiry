1
00:00:35,665 --> 00:00:38,212
- Are you listening to me Michael ?
- Affirmative.

2
00:00:38,385 --> 00:00:40,215
What did I just say ?

3
00:00:40,685 --> 00:00:44,322
You just said...
let me check my notes,

4
00:00:44,325 --> 00:00:45,858
you just said...

5
00:00:45,955 --> 00:00:48,465
Alan and I have created
an incentive program-

6
00:00:48,525 --> 00:00:53,095
Hey ! Hey how is Alan ?
Tell Alan that the Mets suck.

7
00:00:53,295 --> 00:00:56,729
Ok ? From me, big time. Go Pirates !

8
00:00:56,815 --> 00:00:58,111
- No I'm not gonna do that.
- Ok.

9
00:00:58,147 --> 00:01:00,440
We've created an incentive
program to increase sales.

10
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:03,828
At the end of the month you can
reward your top seller with a prize,

11
00:01:03,949 --> 00:01:05,015
worth up to one thousand dollars.

12
00:01:05,076 --> 00:01:08,566
Wo ! Howdy-ho. A thousand big ones.
That's cool.

13
00:01:08,585 --> 00:01:10,502
Do I get to pick the prize ?

14
00:01:10,557 --> 00:01:12,912
Uh, yes, yes you can.

15
00:01:13,307 --> 00:01:18,302
Question : does top salesman
include people who were at one time,

16
00:01:18,316 --> 00:01:22,241
such outstanding salesmen
that they've been promoted to...

17
00:01:22,316 --> 00:01:25,823
No Michael, you can't win this prize.

18
00:01:26,106 --> 00:01:27,713
I didn't mean me !

19
00:01:33,367 --> 00:01:35,770
Well, first what we
have to do is find out

20
00:01:35,836 --> 00:01:38,353
what motivates people
more than anything else ?

21
00:01:38,415 --> 00:01:39,351
Sex.

22
00:01:39,397 --> 00:01:41,561
It's illegal, can't do that.
Next best thing.

23
00:01:41,676 --> 00:01:42,350
Torture.

24
00:01:42,568 --> 00:01:45,322
Come on Dwight. Just, help me
out here. This is stupid.

25
00:01:45,918 --> 00:01:47,360
- Michael ?
- Pam !

26
00:01:47,457 --> 00:01:49,110
- There's...
- Burger with cheese.

27
00:01:49,307 --> 00:01:51,003
- There's a person here...
- And fries.

28
00:01:51,155 --> 00:01:53,101
- There's...
- And shake. What, go ahead.

29
00:01:53,346 --> 00:01:55,333
There's a person here
who wants to sell handbags.

30
00:01:55,365 --> 00:01:58,132
No vendors in the office.
That is a distraction.

31
00:01:58,345 --> 00:02:01,163
- Ok I told her you'd talk to her at least.
- Pam come on I'm busy,

32
00:02:01,618 --> 00:02:04,101
- so just tell her to go away.
- Ok.

33
00:02:10,145 --> 00:02:12,242
Alright I'll talk to her.

34
00:02:12,357 --> 00:02:13,413
This one is hand-embroidered.

35
00:02:13,416 --> 00:02:16,193
Alright girls, break it up,
you're being infiltrated.

36
00:02:16,365 --> 00:02:17,310
Cock in the henhouse.

37
00:02:17,358 --> 00:02:19,441
- Cocks in the henhouse !
- Don't say cocks.

38
00:02:21,085 --> 00:02:23,990
Oh, What is you name my fair lass ?

39
00:02:24,367 --> 00:02:26,233
- Katy.
- Oh Katy.

40
00:02:26,296 --> 00:02:28,453
Wow ! Look at you !

41
00:02:28,487 --> 00:02:32,732
You're like the new and
improved Pam. Pam 6.0.

42
00:02:34,457 --> 00:02:37,410
Look, oh, hey, no cat fights you two,

43
00:02:37,488 --> 00:02:39,351
- I'm against violence in the workplace.
- So am I.

44
00:02:39,418 --> 00:02:41,073
- Nobody cares what you think.
- Doesn't matter.

45
00:02:41,188 --> 00:02:43,003
So you know what ?

46
00:02:43,035 --> 00:02:45,490
I usually don't allow
solicitors in the office,

47
00:02:45,607 --> 00:02:48,402
but today I am going
to break some rules,

48
00:02:48,555 --> 00:02:50,801
and you can have the conference room.
It's yours, all day.

49
00:02:50,988 --> 00:02:54,093
- Wow, thanks.
- There's a H.R. meeting there at 11 :30.

50
00:02:54,117 --> 00:02:57,003
Well, let's put them in the hallway.

51
00:02:57,148 --> 00:02:59,202
We'll give them some chairs. Right ?

52
00:02:59,288 --> 00:03:03,890
Decisiveness, one of the keys to success,
according to "Small Businessman".

53
00:03:04,068 --> 00:03:06,123
I do, I read "small businessman",

54
00:03:06,157 --> 00:03:09,923
I also subscribe to "USA today",

55
00:03:10,107 --> 00:03:12,981
and "American Way Magazine".

56
00:03:12,998 --> 00:03:16,401
That's the in-flight magazine,
some great articles in that.

57
00:03:16,748 --> 00:03:22,483
They did this great profile
last month of Doris Roberts,

58
00:03:23,117 --> 00:03:25,691
and where she likes to eat
when she's in Phoenix.

59
00:03:26,407 --> 00:03:27,400
Illuminating.

60
00:03:27,647 --> 00:03:29,493
This is my conference room,

61
00:03:29,586 --> 00:03:32,240
so please, make yourself at home.

62
00:03:32,378 --> 00:03:35,121
Whatever you need, I'm right
on the other side of this wall,

63
00:03:35,236 --> 00:03:38,660
there used to be a window here,
there's not anymore.

64
00:03:38,737 --> 00:03:40,532
So that's where I will be.

65
00:03:41,348 --> 00:03:45,420
So if you need anything else,
something to make you more comfortable,

66
00:03:45,818 --> 00:03:49,012
just don't hesitate to ask, I'm right here.

67
00:03:49,237 --> 00:03:54,022
- I guess a cup of coffee would be great.
- Wait a second.

68
00:03:54,607 --> 00:03:58,811
I should have spotted another addict.
Gotta love the "bucks".

69
00:03:59,055 --> 00:03:59,941
What ?

70
00:04:00,047 --> 00:04:02,583
It's like a slang for Starbucks,
they're all over the place.

71
00:04:02,645 --> 00:04:06,530
Oh man, that place is like
the promised land, to me...

72
00:04:06,878 --> 00:04:08,643
What a business model too.

73
00:04:09,048 --> 00:04:12,512
- Too bad we don't have the good stuff here.
- A regular coffee is fine.

74
00:04:12,525 --> 00:04:15,762
- No it's not, it's...
- No, really, it is.

75
00:04:15,786 --> 00:04:18,330
No, here's the thing, you know,

76
00:04:18,908 --> 00:04:25,561
I do my best to be my own man and...

77
00:04:26,425 --> 00:04:28,391
go by the beat of a different drummer.

78
00:04:29,206 --> 00:04:30,363
And nobody gets me,

79
00:04:30,908 --> 00:04:33,342
and they're always putting up walls,
and I'm always tearing them down,

80
00:04:33,358 --> 00:04:36,562
just breaking down barriers,
that's what I do all day.

81
00:04:40,465 --> 00:04:47,522
So, a coffee, regular coffee, for you.
High test or unleaded ?

82
00:04:48,268 --> 00:04:52,353
- Bring it on. Yeah.
- Woo, I will. I'll bring it on. Alright.

83
00:04:54,685 --> 00:04:55,382
So,

84
00:04:56,616 --> 00:04:59,363
are you jealous,
because there's another girl around ?

85
00:04:59,548 --> 00:05:00,442
No.

86
00:05:01,847 --> 00:05:03,802
She's prettier than you though.

87
00:05:07,396 --> 00:05:10,373
That's a very rude thing to say, Kevin.

88
00:05:14,415 --> 00:05:17,921
suit you. I can see
you pairing it with gloves.

89
00:05:18,006 --> 00:05:20,703
The purse girl hits
everything on my checklist.

90
00:05:21,238 --> 00:05:22,091
Creamy skin,

91
00:05:22,656 --> 00:05:23,481
straight teeth,

92
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:25,030
curly hair,

93
00:05:26,186 --> 00:05:27,201
amazing breasts...

94
00:05:27,848 --> 00:05:29,230
Not for me... for my children.

95
00:05:29,566 --> 00:05:32,563
The Schrutes produce very thirsty babies.

96
00:05:32,797 --> 00:05:35,110
There you go,
nice steaming hot cup of joe.

97
00:05:35,446 --> 00:05:36,880
- Thank you.
- I've an idea.

98
00:05:37,187 --> 00:05:38,902
Why don't I introduce you around ?

99
00:05:38,917 --> 00:05:42,413
You know, you can kind of get your foot
in the door, meet potential clientele.

100
00:05:42,457 --> 00:05:42,900
Right ?

101
00:05:43,256 --> 00:05:46,900
Gosh I would love to,
but my purses, I should...

102
00:05:46,918 --> 00:05:50,952
Oh, we can have Ryan take a look, Ryan
would you look after the purses please ?

103
00:05:51,188 --> 00:05:54,363
I'm installing file share
on all the computers.

104
00:05:54,398 --> 00:05:57,251
Technobable, just do it ok ?
we have company.

105
00:05:57,347 --> 00:05:57,882
Right ?

106
00:05:57,957 --> 00:05:59,391
You should sell a lot here,

107
00:05:59,408 --> 00:06:02,460
because this branch made
over a million dollars last year.

108
00:06:02,635 --> 00:06:04,891
Not that we're all millionaires,
I'm probably closest,

109
00:06:06,028 --> 00:06:08,923
Here is Oscar ! Oscar, this is Katie.

110
00:06:08,937 --> 00:06:09,741
I'm on the phone.

111
00:06:09,775 --> 00:06:13,963
Ooh ooh, Oscar the Grouch. Right ?
Yeah, I thought of that. Yeah.

112
00:06:13,986 --> 00:06:17,950
- That was on "Sesame street"
- I know, I made the connection.

113
00:06:18,018 --> 00:06:20,472
Can you believe he'd never heard
that before he worked here ?

114
00:06:20,815 --> 00:06:23,632
- No I don't believe that.
- I know it's unbelievable.

115
00:06:23,927 --> 00:06:25,690
It's nice having Katie around.

116
00:06:26,388 --> 00:06:29,162
It's another person for Michael to...

117
00:06:30,736 --> 00:06:31,932
interact with.

118
00:06:32,205 --> 00:06:37,061
Here is Toby for human ressources.
Katy, Toby. Toby, Katy.

119
00:06:37,736 --> 00:06:40,103
Hey did you go to Bishop O'Hara ?

120
00:06:40,426 --> 00:06:41,740
- Yeah.
- Yeah me too.

121
00:06:41,797 --> 00:06:43,112
- What class...
- Cool what year were you there ?

122
00:06:43,125 --> 00:06:43,480
89...

123
00:06:43,515 --> 00:06:45,261
Toby's divorced. He...

124
00:06:45,268 --> 00:06:47,470
god, recently right ?

125
00:06:47,937 --> 00:06:50,251
You and your wife, and you have kids ?

126
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:52,163
- I have a girl.
- That's so...

127
00:06:52,628 --> 00:06:53,750
That was really messy.

128
00:06:54,396 --> 00:06:56,800
You slept one night in your car, too ?

129
00:06:58,496 --> 00:07:03,472
- I should probably get back to my table.
- Ok, alright. Cool, see you in a bit.

130
00:07:06,776 --> 00:07:08,470
Oh, she's cute.

131
00:07:09,255 --> 00:07:10,870
Cutie pie. Back to work !

132
00:07:12,185 --> 00:07:13,570
I live by one rule :

133
00:07:14,337 --> 00:07:18,363
No office romances.
No way, very messy, inapropriate,

134
00:07:20,145 --> 00:07:20,702
No.

135
00:07:21,235 --> 00:07:21,860
But,

136
00:07:22,728 --> 00:07:23,791
I live by another rule :

137
00:07:25,037 --> 00:07:25,823
Just do it.

138
00:07:26,656 --> 00:07:27,773
Nike.

139
00:07:28,447 --> 00:07:31,313
Hey Jimmy, what do you think
about that little purse girl ?

140
00:07:31,728 --> 00:07:33,100
Cute sure.

141
00:07:33,695 --> 00:07:36,233
- Why don't you get on that ?
- She's not really my type.

142
00:07:37,156 --> 00:07:38,522
What are you, gay ?

143
00:07:40,010 --> 00:07:41,248
I don't think so. Nope.

144
00:07:41,359 --> 00:07:42,735
What is your type ?

145
00:07:45,576 --> 00:07:47,956
Moms, primarily, yeah,

146
00:07:48,046 --> 00:07:52,272
soccer moms, single moms,
nascar moms, any type of mom really.

147
00:07:52,367 --> 00:07:53,473
That's disgusting.

148
00:07:53,535 --> 00:07:55,670
- Stay away from my mom.
- Too late Kevin.

149
00:08:01,507 --> 00:08:04,562
Man I would be all over that
if I wasn't dating Pam.

150
00:08:06,176 --> 00:08:08,121
We're not dating we're engaged.

151
00:08:09,196 --> 00:08:10,240
Engaged yeah.

152
00:08:24,856 --> 00:08:26,131
Pam and I are good buddies.

153
00:08:26,406 --> 00:08:28,930
I'm sort of Pam's go-to guy,
for her problems.

154
00:08:29,607 --> 00:08:31,230
You know with stuff like work,

155
00:08:31,846 --> 00:08:33,992
or her fiancé Roy,

156
00:08:36,906 --> 00:08:39,493
Nope those are pretty much
her only two problems.

157
00:08:40,775 --> 00:08:42,681
She'd be perfect for you.

158
00:08:43,107 --> 00:08:46,080
- She's been talking to Michael a lot.
- So what ?

159
00:08:46,636 --> 00:08:49,483
- You're assistant regional manager.
- Assistant to the regional manager.

160
00:08:49,505 --> 00:08:52,181
You know what Dwight,
he's your work boss, ok ?

161
00:08:52,255 --> 00:08:54,640
- He's not your relationship boss.
- That's true.

162
00:08:54,656 --> 00:08:57,251
Plus you have so much more
to talk to this girl about.

163
00:08:58,128 --> 00:09:02,623
You're both salesmen, I mean
that's something right there.

164
00:09:02,697 --> 00:09:03,512
True.

165
00:09:04,328 --> 00:09:07,361
Plus I can talk to her about
the origins of my last name.

166
00:09:08,047 --> 00:09:09,302
It's all gold.

167
00:09:11,086 --> 00:09:12,752
Guys are usually my best customers,

168
00:09:12,785 --> 00:09:16,262
they buy the high-end stuff, like
the beads and the sequins and stuff,

169
00:09:16,638 --> 00:09:18,050
for gifts, you know.

170
00:09:18,305 --> 00:09:21,901
They don't know what they're
looking at so... I make suggestions.

171
00:09:22,075 --> 00:09:24,732
Alight, here the thing, ok ?
Just keep talking to her.

172
00:09:25,008 --> 00:09:26,810
If you hit a stall you have
a perfect fall back.

173
00:09:26,828 --> 00:09:28,410
- What's that ?
- You buy a purse.

174
00:09:28,526 --> 00:09:32,030
- I don't want a purse, purses are for girls.
- Dwight, that's not necessarily true.

175
00:09:32,056 --> 00:09:33,520
- Do you read GQ ?
- No.

176
00:09:33,545 --> 00:09:38,022
Ok I do, they're like mini briefcases.
Alright, lots of guys have them.

177
00:09:38,278 --> 00:09:39,600
- Like those ?
- Yes !

178
00:09:39,657 --> 00:09:42,403
Listen, you are spending way
too much time talking to me

179
00:09:42,417 --> 00:09:44,942
- when you could be talking to her.
- Ok I'm just gonna use the bathroom and

180
00:09:44,508 --> 00:09:44,943
No !

181
00:09:44,976 --> 00:09:47,862
You don't need the bathroom.
You've got it. Go.

182
00:09:51,317 --> 00:09:56,901
Ok, shh. Stop, whatever you're doing,
cause this is going to be good.

183
00:09:57,506 --> 00:10:01,262
"Hi my name is Dwigth Schrute and
I would like to buy a purse from you.

184
00:10:01,518 --> 00:10:06,333
Good lord look at these purses !
This is something special.

185
00:10:06,425 --> 00:10:11,563
Oh my god !
Is this Salvatore de Chini... asta ?

186
00:10:11,607 --> 00:10:14,212
Oh definitely, definitely
step in and out of it like that.

187
00:10:14,315 --> 00:10:15,650
- Yes.
- You put it on...

188
00:10:15,656 --> 00:10:19,901
Well I want to stress test it,
you know, in case anything happens.

189
00:10:20,026 --> 00:10:23,371
Oh, that was really...

190
00:10:24,066 --> 00:10:27,440
this is necessary to do,
to really give it a good workout.

191
00:10:27,468 --> 00:10:31,360
This is the ohhh,
this is the prettiest one of all !

192
00:10:31,896 --> 00:10:34,501
I'm gonna be the
prettiest girl in the ball.

193
00:10:34,697 --> 00:10:39,290
- Oh how much ?
- Oh god it's sad, it's so sad.

194
00:10:39,375 --> 00:10:40,811
Here he comes, shh.

195
00:10:48,098 --> 00:10:50,371
- He did pick a good one.
- You're horrible !

196
00:10:50,625 --> 00:10:52,461
This one's really good for a hot date.

197
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:55,390
Yeah what's that ? I'm engaged.

198
00:10:55,427 --> 00:10:57,801
Oh congratulations. You need
a hot date more than anyone.

199
00:10:57,958 --> 00:10:59,201
I wish, right ?

200
00:11:01,785 --> 00:11:06,063
I get it, I get it. Divine Secrets Of
The Ya-Ya Sisterhood over here. Right ?

201
00:11:06,856 --> 00:11:10,952
- So how was that coffee from earlier ?
- It was good.

202
00:11:11,727 --> 00:11:15,661
I knew it. Guzzled it down,
you greedy little thing.

203
00:11:16,117 --> 00:11:19,332
So Pam, is this your lunch break or

204
00:11:19,647 --> 00:11:24,252
was that earlier when you were eating
in the kitchen with those guys ?

205
00:11:26,655 --> 00:11:29,051
- Sorry.
- Busted !

206
00:11:29,888 --> 00:11:30,920
- Come back.
- Oh hey,

207
00:11:30,945 --> 00:11:33,492
I want to show you something, come here.

208
00:11:33,726 --> 00:11:37,461
I know you are going to like this. I
picked it up today, a thousand big ones.

209
00:11:37,535 --> 00:11:41,812
- Is that from starbucks ?
- Yes. This is a Starbucks digital barista.

210
00:11:41,865 --> 00:11:44,401
This is the Mack Daddy
of espresso makers.

211
00:11:45,428 --> 00:11:47,872
- Is that for the office ?
- I know what you're thinking.

212
00:11:47,926 --> 00:11:50,683
You're not prying this out of my hands.

213
00:11:51,367 --> 00:11:55,020
- Don't tempt me because I'll give it to you.
- I wouldn't think of it.

214
00:11:55,107 --> 00:11:58,180
Coffee is the great
incentivizer in the office.

215
00:11:58,508 --> 00:12:03,322
It's a drug. It is quite literally
a drug, that speeds people up.

216
00:12:03,538 --> 00:12:05,463
It's not the only drug
that speeds people up.

217
00:12:05,497 --> 00:12:09,173
You hear stories about
Dunder Mifflin in the'80s,

218
00:12:09,326 --> 00:12:11,923
before everybody knew
how bad cocaine was.

219
00:12:12,255 --> 00:12:14,673
God... MAN, did they move paper.

220
00:12:14,977 --> 00:12:19,331
Oh the rotating steam... wand.

221
00:12:21,457 --> 00:12:23,711
- What ? what's the matter ?
- Oh nothing,

222
00:12:24,328 --> 00:12:26,051
my ride just bailed on me.

223
00:12:26,837 --> 00:12:31,363
God, I'm sorry, where are you going ?
nearby ? Because I could give you a ride.

224
00:12:31,466 --> 00:12:32,000
No.

225
00:12:32,038 --> 00:12:34,713
- Sure ?
- I don't want to inconvenience you.

226
00:12:34,756 --> 00:12:38,042
God ! No no no inconvenience.
I'm out of here at five sharp.

227
00:12:38,105 --> 00:12:39,502
- At five ?
- I can go earlier,

228
00:12:39,526 --> 00:12:44,240
because I'm the boss, you know.
Whatever. I'm out of here, slaves.

229
00:12:42,837 --> 00:12:43,702
Ok.

230
00:12:45,097 --> 00:12:46,691
- What ?
- Ok.

231
00:12:46,925 --> 00:12:47,661
Ok.

232
00:12:47,938 --> 00:12:50,971
Ok I guess that would be ok.

233
00:12:51,015 --> 00:12:55,140
Sounds good, five o clock sharp, I will
give you and your purses a ride home.

234
00:12:55,196 --> 00:12:57,380
- Ok. Cool.
- Excellent. Great. Great.

235
00:12:57,497 --> 00:12:59,650
- Cool.
- Cool.

236
00:13:07,446 --> 00:13:09,871
I should never have let
the temp touch this thing.

237
00:13:09,948 --> 00:13:14,243
I had all these great icons and
now I have four folders, so...

238
00:13:14,297 --> 00:13:16,082
- It's actually better this way.
- No it's not,

239
00:13:16,096 --> 00:13:19,001
because I could just click on the
icon and then I'm onto something

240
00:13:19,016 --> 00:13:20,723
Michael could I ask you something ?

241
00:13:20,938 --> 00:13:23,451
I wanted to ask your
permission to ask out Katy.

242
00:13:23,645 --> 00:13:27,510
- I know it's against the rules and everything...
- No it's not against the rules,

243
00:13:27,566 --> 00:13:32,202
- She's not a permanent employee so it's not.
- Thank you Michael. I appreciate this so much...

244
00:13:32,216 --> 00:13:37,452
But I think that you should just know that
I am going to be giving her a ride home later.

245
00:13:37,667 --> 00:13:38,611
What ?

246
00:13:39,047 --> 00:13:42,851
She asked me for a ride, and so
I'm going to give her a ride home.

247
00:13:43,186 --> 00:13:46,880
Is that all it is, just a ride home ?
Like a taxi-cab ?

248
00:13:47,076 --> 00:13:49,502
Well, might be a ride home,

249
00:13:50,027 --> 00:13:56,291
might be a ride home and we stop
for coffee and... dot, dot, dot.

250
00:13:59,085 --> 00:14:04,072
Please, please, I am your inferior,
and I'm asking you this favor,

251
00:14:04,455 --> 00:14:08,231
can you promise me that
it will just be a ride home ?

252
00:14:11,567 --> 00:14:14,592
- No. I cannot promise you...
- You cannot promise me,

253
00:14:14,595 --> 00:14:17,361
- or you won't promise me ?
- Listen, Dwight.

254
00:14:17,808 --> 00:14:19,942
- Do you love her ?
- Dwight no.

255
00:14:20,046 --> 00:14:21,233
I don't know,

256
00:14:22,937 --> 00:14:24,660
it's too early to tell,

257
00:14:25,668 --> 00:14:27,303
I don't know how I feel.

258
00:14:32,666 --> 00:14:35,583
I think you've made a really good
choice she's really gonna like that.

259
00:14:35,646 --> 00:14:37,001
Espresso ?

260
00:14:37,378 --> 00:14:39,150
- Oh thank you.
- You're welcome.

261
00:14:43,405 --> 00:14:46,493
Is that from the machine
that was in your office ?

262
00:14:47,206 --> 00:14:49,773
I thought that was the incentive
prize for the top salesperson ?

263
00:14:49,778 --> 00:14:51,070
Very easy to clean.

264
00:14:52,057 --> 00:14:52,772
Ok.

265
00:14:53,415 --> 00:14:56,751
Like he's gonna win it anyway. Right ?

266
00:15:03,116 --> 00:15:05,791
- So did we get any mail ?
- Yeah I gave it to you.

267
00:15:05,966 --> 00:15:07,801
Yes you did.

268
00:15:08,117 --> 00:15:11,283
Just checking, double checking,
checking on the check.

269
00:15:11,816 --> 00:15:14,091
Thoroughness is very important
in an office.

270
00:15:15,327 --> 00:15:17,091
- And...
- So can I...

271
00:15:17,116 --> 00:15:18,720
Yeah of course.

272
00:15:19,105 --> 00:15:23,241
Pam, one more thing, how do girls
of your age feel about futons ?

273
00:15:24,546 --> 00:15:27,220
A futon ? He's a grown man.

274
00:15:27,258 --> 00:15:29,231
- That's what he said.
- That's sad.

275
00:15:30,098 --> 00:15:35,611
Or it's innovative. You know the futon
in a bed and couch all rolled into one.

276
00:15:36,037 --> 00:15:38,221
- What's up ?
- Hey !

277
00:15:38,968 --> 00:15:41,961
- Are you still mad at me ?
- Roy.

278
00:15:42,255 --> 00:15:43,710
- Come on.
- Cut it out.

279
00:15:43,718 --> 00:15:44,930
- Come on, are you mad at me ?
- Stop it.

280
00:15:44,958 --> 00:15:47,550
- Are you still mad at me now ?
- Cut it out !

281
00:15:49,817 --> 00:15:50,463
Come on !

282
00:15:50,816 --> 00:15:51,713
Come on Pammy !

283
00:15:51,738 --> 00:15:53,320
- Stop I can't breathe.
- I was just kidding.

284
00:15:53,358 --> 00:15:54,722
You know I didn't mean it.

285
00:15:56,048 --> 00:15:58,640
Jim is a great guy,
he's like a brother to me.

286
00:15:58,776 --> 00:16:01,120
We're like best friends in the office.

287
00:16:01,975 --> 00:16:03,920
I really hope he finds someone.

288
00:16:04,057 --> 00:16:07,612
You seem to like to touch things,
you should try the velvet.

289
00:16:07,737 --> 00:16:13,283
I don't like to necessarily touch
things, I'm just... I'm shopping.

290
00:16:13,448 --> 00:16:15,373
Oh no it's fine that you...

291
00:16:17,248 --> 00:16:19,222
Here. What about the raspberry one ?

292
00:16:19,508 --> 00:16:23,690
It's really kind of festive,
it's got a lot of personality.

293
00:16:22,306 --> 00:16:23,691
Yeah no.

294
00:16:23,797 --> 00:16:27,710
Hey, how's it going, good can I talk
to you for a second, in private ?

295
00:16:28,027 --> 00:16:29,772
- I don't think so, I'm busy.
- It'll just take a second.

296
00:16:29,838 --> 00:16:30,593
- I can't.
- Just for a minute,

297
00:16:30,617 --> 00:16:32,073
- Please.
- I really can't.

298
00:16:32,158 --> 00:16:36,963
I wanted to talk to you in private because
I wanted to ask you out on a date.

299
00:16:37,646 --> 00:16:38,761
No !

300
00:16:46,338 --> 00:16:51,252
Okay, was that no to talking to me in
private or was that no to the date ?

301
00:16:51,937 --> 00:16:53,080
Both.

302
00:16:58,627 --> 00:17:05,403
- What colors do you like ?
- Grey, dark grey, charcoal...

303
00:17:06,245 --> 00:17:07,030
- Ryan ?
- Yeah ?

304
00:17:07,097 --> 00:17:11,101
- Would you like to help me with a special project ?
- I'd love to.

305
00:17:12,347 --> 00:17:16,592
- OK just throw out all the empties.
- You don't want to recycle them ?

306
00:17:17,018 --> 00:17:20,371
Yes, throw them away
in the recycling bin.

307
00:17:21,478 --> 00:17:22,702
Do you want this ?

308
00:17:24,578 --> 00:17:25,640
No.

309
00:17:27,298 --> 00:17:29,131
What about this bottle of power drink ?

310
00:17:29,148 --> 00:17:30,552
- What flavor ?
- Blue.

311
00:17:30,606 --> 00:17:33,303
- Blue is not a flavor.
- It says flavor : blue blast.

312
00:17:33,356 --> 00:17:35,563
Oh blue blast.
Yes, put that in the trunk.

313
00:17:35,658 --> 00:17:37,852
And there should be an unopened
Arctic Chill back there.

314
00:17:37,888 --> 00:17:41,153
I want that in the passanger's
cup holder. Thank you.

315
00:17:50,467 --> 00:17:51,982
- Hi.
- Hi !

316
00:17:52,225 --> 00:17:53,833
- I'm Jim, by the way.
- I'm Katy.

317
00:17:53,845 --> 00:17:55,533
- Hi Katy, nice to meet you.
- You sit out there don't you ?

318
00:17:55,537 --> 00:17:58,493
I do. That's what I'm best known for,

319
00:17:58,497 --> 00:17:59,503
sitting out there.

320
00:17:59,575 --> 00:18:01,862
Alright let's talk about purses.

321
00:18:01,958 --> 00:18:03,673
- Ok uh...
- Katy, but,

322
00:18:03,756 --> 00:18:07,142
you know what ? Don't try
to sell me one, ok ? Seriously.

323
00:18:07,427 --> 00:18:09,490
Because I'm just here to learn.

324
00:18:09,598 --> 00:18:09,860
Ok.

325
00:18:09,885 --> 00:18:12,630
- So I know about most of these, but...
- Ok.

326
00:18:13,667 --> 00:18:15,563
What's up ? Whoa ! That's my Drakkar Noir.

327
00:18:15,637 --> 00:18:19,040
- No, this is Rite Aid - Night Sweat.
- No, it is a perfect smell-alike.

328
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:21,483
I'm not paying for the label.
Right here, give it.

329
00:18:21,496 --> 00:18:25,053
- Well it's empty.
- No it's not, there's some in the straw.

330
00:18:28,125 --> 00:18:30,390
There now you may throw it out.

331
00:18:35,158 --> 00:18:39,441
- How many Filet-O-Fishes did you eat ?
- That's over several months, Ryan.

332
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:40,642
Still.

333
00:18:42,418 --> 00:18:44,213
- What's up ?
- I'm bored.

334
00:18:44,727 --> 00:18:46,562
Thank you, for chosing me.

335
00:18:47,425 --> 00:18:51,120
No I'm kidding. So you got
big plans this weekend ?

336
00:18:53,026 --> 00:18:55,072
Well I think I'm gonna see Katie.

337
00:18:55,787 --> 00:18:57,383
- Really ?
- Yeah.

338
00:18:58,007 --> 00:19:02,420
- What are you guys going to do ?
- Oh man, I don't know. Dinner.

339
00:19:03,146 --> 00:19:06,311
Drinks, movie, matching tattoos.

340
00:19:07,026 --> 00:19:09,660
- That's great. That's cool.
- Big stuff. Yeah.

341
00:19:10,485 --> 00:19:13,151
- What are you doing ?
- I was going to say that I think,

342
00:19:13,238 --> 00:19:15,750
- We're going to help Roy's cousin move.
- Okay.

343
00:19:15,808 --> 00:19:17,641
Because Roy's got a truck.

344
00:19:19,037 --> 00:19:20,401
That's cool.

345
00:19:21,237 --> 00:19:23,293
- Yes.
- That is cool.

346
00:19:24,367 --> 00:19:26,420
- I'll see you Monday, though, right ?
- Great.

347
00:19:27,446 --> 00:19:29,340
- I'm gonna head back.
- Alright.

348
00:19:35,767 --> 00:19:37,682
I think in order to be a ladies'man,

349
00:19:37,958 --> 00:19:40,542
it's imperative that people
don't know you're a ladies'man,

350
00:19:40,806 --> 00:19:43,250
so I kind of play that close to the chest.

351
00:19:44,458 --> 00:19:48,372
I don't know, what can I say ? women
are attracted to power. And I think,

352
00:19:49,186 --> 00:19:52,340
other people have told me
I have a very symmetrical face.

353
00:19:54,527 --> 00:20:01,261
So I don't know, maybe
they're right, I don't know.

354
00:20:13,076 --> 00:20:16,391
Sure you don't want me to help you with that ?
Cause I can grab that no problem.

355
00:20:14,467 --> 00:20:16,360
Goodnight. It was nice to meet some of you.

356
00:20:16,476 --> 00:20:19,243
See you later. Goodnight.

357
00:20:20,338 --> 00:20:22,963
- Goodnight Jim.
- Goodnight Michael.

358
00:20:23,378 --> 00:20:24,730
Where are you going ?

359
00:20:25,297 --> 00:20:27,240
I do'nt know, grab a drink, I think.

360
00:20:28,718 --> 00:20:30,191
With us ?

361
00:20:30,856 --> 00:20:35,572
I probably should have told you. I don't need a
ride now cause Jim can take me home after. So,

362
00:20:35,657 --> 00:20:38,462
- You're off the hook.
- Okay great. Off the hook, excellent. Okay cool.

363
00:20:38,497 --> 00:20:40,103
- I got this.
- Alright, have fun.

364
00:20:40,177 --> 00:20:41,781
- Thank you
- Don't drink and drive.

365
00:20:43,307 --> 00:20:44,720
- Take it easy !
- Have a good night !

366
00:20:44,745 --> 00:20:48,153
- You too. Have a good night.
- You got that ?

367
00:20:48,417 --> 00:20:51,172
- You sold a lot, so it's lighter.
- Yeah.

368
00:20:52,418 --> 00:20:54,583
Here.

369
00:20:55,265 --> 00:20:57,192
Squeeze it inside.

370
00:20:57,728 --> 00:20:59,452
Now, I'm gonna warn you,

371
00:20:59,536 --> 00:21:01,193
- Don't freak out. Okay ?
- Why ?

372
00:21:01,225 --> 00:21:04,973
This is a really nice car. In case you
haven't noticed, this is a Corolla. Okay ?

373
00:21:04,986 --> 00:21:08,502
- It's a- It's a very nice car.
- So you're not going to freak out.

374
00:21:08,807 --> 00:21:12,110
Do I have a special someone ?

375
00:21:12,148 --> 00:21:14,980
Well, yeah. Of course. A bunch of them.

376
00:21:15,496 --> 00:21:16,991
My employees.

377
00:21:18,067 --> 00:21:22,182
If I had to choose between a one-night stand
with some stupid cow I'd pick up at a bar,

378
00:21:22,286 --> 00:21:24,990
and these people,
I'd pick them every time.

379
00:21:25,068 --> 00:21:28,603
Because with them, it is an every-day stand.

380
00:21:29,398 --> 00:21:34,500
And I still know their names
in the morning.
