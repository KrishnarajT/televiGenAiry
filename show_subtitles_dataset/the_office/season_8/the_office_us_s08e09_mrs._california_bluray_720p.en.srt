1
00:00:03,358 --> 00:00:04,900
Oops. A little help

2
00:00:07,862 --> 00:00:09,989
Wow, your hair
is really thinning

3
00:00:10,782 --> 00:00:13,993
Standing is proven to be
healthier, increases productivity

4
00:00:14,077 --> 00:00:15,369
and just looks cooler

5
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:18,247
Picture someone
doing something heroic

6
00:00:18,331 --> 00:00:20,582
Now, was he sitting
or standing?

7
00:00:21,543 --> 00:00:22,751
Not counting FDR

8
00:00:23,378 --> 00:00:25,504
Every second you sit there
is an hour off your life

9
00:00:25,588 --> 00:00:27,423
Look at all of you

10
00:00:27,924 --> 00:00:29,550
I feel like you're
in a suicide cult

11
00:00:29,676 --> 00:00:32,344
No, no, no. You're
way off on that one.

12
00:00:32,429 --> 00:00:34,471
Are you really
comfortable standing there?

13
00:00:34,556 --> 00:00:37,683
I tried one of those, and I just
couldn't find the sweet spot

14
00:00:41,646 --> 00:00:44,648
Hey, guys, let's just all admit it, okay?
Dwight's better than us

15
00:00:45,025 --> 00:00:47,067
He had the guts
to stop sitting,

16
00:00:47,152 --> 00:00:49,862
and he's never, ever gonna
go back on it, right?

17
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:51,405
That's right, Jim

18
00:01:01,624 --> 00:01:02,791
Hey, man
Hey

19
00:01:03,418 --> 00:01:04,918
Taking a
load off, huh?

20
00:01:05,045 --> 00:01:06,587
No. Putting a
load on, more like

21
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:07,963
Good luck with that

22
00:01:08,131 --> 00:01:09,423
Last thing I need is luck

23
00:01:15,805 --> 00:01:17,014
Thank you so much

24
00:01:34,115 --> 00:01:35,699
What are you up to?
Oh, look out

25
00:01:35,825 --> 00:01:36,867
Just... What are you doing?

26
00:01:36,993 --> 00:01:38,077
Think fast. Ha ha

27
00:01:38,369 --> 00:01:40,162
Give that back Come on. Prank

28
00:01:41,331 --> 00:01:42,581
That's real creative

29
00:01:42,665 --> 00:01:43,832
You know what you're
right It's not my best

30
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,125
'Cause you could
easily just bend over

31
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:46,251
and pick that up
right?

32
00:01:46,336 --> 00:01:48,212
I could. I just don't
feel like it, loser

33
00:01:48,296 --> 00:01:49,421
Because you're sitting?
Standing

34
00:01:49,506 --> 00:01:51,006
Okay.
Don't

35
00:01:51,341 --> 00:01:52,674
Because you're sitting?
Standing

36
00:01:53,259 --> 00:01:54,343
You know
I have to do this

37
00:01:55,512 --> 00:01:56,470
I know

38
00:01:56,554 --> 00:01:57,554
Whoa

39
00:02:19,911 --> 00:02:23,872
Andrew Baines Bernard

40
00:02:23,998 --> 00:02:25,791
I think you could
just do Andy Bernard

41
00:02:25,875 --> 00:02:28,293
Andrew Baines Bernard
I love filling

42
00:02:28,419 --> 00:02:30,879
these out 'cause it's like
Oh, I'm taking a test

43
00:02:30,964 --> 00:02:32,506
but I know the answers

44
00:02:33,383 --> 00:02:37,261
In four seconds, my wife is going
to be coming through that door

45
00:02:37,387 --> 00:02:38,470
I told her she
could work here

46
00:02:38,555 --> 00:02:41,306
Under no circumstances
can that be allowed to happen

47
00:02:43,351 --> 00:02:44,935
There you are, honey

48
00:02:45,061 --> 00:02:47,104
How on earth did
you miss the elevator?

49
00:02:47,188 --> 00:02:48,147
What was that?

50
00:02:48,231 --> 00:02:49,648
I don't know.
He wasn't talking to me

51
00:02:49,732 --> 00:02:52,234
But if I were you,
I wouldn't hire his wife

52
00:02:53,570 --> 00:02:55,154
That's why my foundation

53
00:02:55,238 --> 00:02:56,363
the Dream For
A Wish Foundation

54
00:02:56,447 --> 00:02:57,614
is gonna put them
out of business.

55
00:02:57,740 --> 00:03:00,033
They're not gonna
know what hit them

56
00:03:00,118 --> 00:03:03,245
Everyone, I'd like
to introduce my wife

57
00:03:03,329 --> 00:03:04,830
Mrs. Robert California

58
00:03:04,914 --> 00:03:07,124
Mrs. California
this is everyone

59
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:08,250
Hello.
Hi

60
00:03:08,334 --> 00:03:10,335
Welcome.
Call me Susan, please

61
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:13,839
Last night at dinner,
Susan and I were talking

62
00:03:13,923 --> 00:03:15,465
about her returning
to work.

63
00:03:15,842 --> 00:03:19,178
So she's here today
to see if there's a good fit

64
00:03:19,262 --> 00:03:21,638
Something tells me it
just might work out

65
00:03:22,932 --> 00:03:25,851
This is Andy Bernard,
the regional manager

66
00:03:25,935 --> 00:03:27,019
Hello. Nice to meet you

67
00:03:27,145 --> 00:03:28,187
Hey there.
It's a pleasure. Welcome

68
00:03:28,271 --> 00:03:29,271
Thank you

69
00:03:29,355 --> 00:03:30,898
Andy, would you
be so kind

70
00:03:30,982 --> 00:03:32,691
as to show Susan
around the office,

71
00:03:32,775 --> 00:03:34,776
introduce her to
various departments

72
00:03:35,278 --> 00:03:37,112
find a place
where she'll shine?

73
00:03:37,322 --> 00:03:40,032
I would love to,
but I have to be

74
00:03:40,116 --> 00:03:41,575
completely honest
with you guys.

75
00:03:42,243 --> 00:03:43,535
We're 100% staffed up

76
00:03:46,206 --> 00:03:49,791
Andy, let's see if there's a
good fit first then we'll talk

77
00:03:53,922 --> 00:03:55,255
All right.

78
00:03:55,673 --> 00:03:57,549
Knock, knock, knock
Knock, knock, knock

79
00:03:57,675 --> 00:03:59,426
You don't have to say
it if you're doing it

80
00:03:59,510 --> 00:04:01,553
Remember how you said

81
00:04:01,638 --> 00:04:03,889
that you were looking
for a place in the office

82
00:04:03,973 --> 00:04:06,308
to do calisthenics
and aerobics?

83
00:04:07,477 --> 00:04:08,977
Ah, weightlifting, yeah

84
00:04:09,354 --> 00:04:10,395
Well, today's
your lucky day

85
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,689
I have opened
in this very office building

86
00:04:12,815 --> 00:04:15,067
Dwight Schrute's
Gym for Muscles

87
00:04:15,318 --> 00:04:17,152
Want to take a look?
I'll take a look

88
00:04:17,487 --> 00:04:21,156
Your path from
obesity begins right here

89
00:04:22,992 --> 00:04:26,078
I've been meaning to join
a gym For my health.

90
00:04:26,496 --> 00:04:29,498
I used to say I wanted to live long
enough to see a black president.

91
00:04:29,624 --> 00:04:31,333
I didn't realize how
easy that would be.

92
00:04:31,501 --> 00:04:32,709
So now I want to
live long enough

93
00:04:32,794 --> 00:04:35,295
to see a really,
really gay president

94
00:04:35,463 --> 00:04:36,672
or a supermodel president.

95
00:04:37,257 --> 00:04:39,549
All the different
kinds of presidents

96
00:04:40,093 --> 00:04:42,844
Obese people in my office
building are a drain on resources

97
00:04:43,137 --> 00:04:44,554
Chairs wear out faster

98
00:04:44,764 --> 00:04:46,515
It takes more freon
to keep them cool

99
00:04:46,599 --> 00:04:48,183
They flush the
toilets more often

100
00:04:48,268 --> 00:04:51,144
Plus, their massive BMs
bust the rivets on my pipes

101
00:04:52,021 --> 00:04:56,191
But a gym turns
fat into cash.

102
00:04:57,235 --> 00:05:00,153
All right, the DM
Express is pulling out

103
00:05:00,238 --> 00:05:01,863
All right, well it was really
nice to meet you, Brian

104
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:03,115
Ah, it's actually Ryan

105
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:04,533
Oh, Ryan.
Yeah

106
00:05:05,368 --> 00:05:06,535
Bitch

107
00:05:07,203 --> 00:05:09,579
We will start
here at Erinville

108
00:05:09,664 --> 00:05:10,664
Hi

109
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:12,207
Reception

110
00:05:12,292 --> 00:05:13,917
Your classic
one-man operation

111
00:05:14,043 --> 00:05:15,627
Although, I was
watching a movie

112
00:05:15,753 --> 00:05:17,379
and Meryl Streep
had two secretaries

113
00:05:17,463 --> 00:05:20,424
I was watching a movie and a bunch
of apes took over San Francisco

114
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:21,800
Just saying

115
00:05:21,884 --> 00:05:25,387
Two secretaries could convey
a sense of importance

116
00:05:25,555 --> 00:05:27,097
and success to our clients

117
00:05:27,265 --> 00:05:30,600
Certainly worth exploring.
Wouldn't you agree, Andy?

118
00:05:31,561 --> 00:05:33,562
I'll explore exploring it - Good

119
00:05:33,813 --> 00:05:35,814
Seems like you have
this under control,

120
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:38,483
so I'll just duck out and run
the company for a while.

121
00:05:38,568 --> 00:05:39,568
Okay

122
00:05:43,614 --> 00:05:46,491
Okay, next stop
on the tour, sales

123
00:05:46,826 --> 00:05:49,828
Here we go Station
stop Jim Halpert.

124
00:05:49,912 --> 00:05:51,913
Oh, boy, our resident
truth teller Uh

125
00:05:52,081 --> 00:05:53,540
All right, have at it
Let her rip.

126
00:05:53,666 --> 00:05:55,083
What do you hate
about this place?

127
00:05:56,669 --> 00:05:58,628
Well, it's sales,
so you have to be able

128
00:05:58,755 --> 00:06:00,756
to live in the
world of rejection

129
00:06:00,882 --> 00:06:02,341
Maybe you do

130
00:06:02,592 --> 00:06:03,925
Hi, I'm Dwight

131
00:06:04,093 --> 00:06:07,721
Sales is really not so
hard, okay It's paper

132
00:06:08,056 --> 00:06:09,514
We have it,
and they want it so bad

133
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:11,099
they are willing
to pay for it

134
00:06:11,267 --> 00:06:12,267
Jim?

135
00:06:12,352 --> 00:06:14,603
Well, it's not that easy

136
00:06:14,687 --> 00:06:16,188
It's kind of
sometimes difficult

137
00:06:16,606 --> 00:06:18,690
It's the second-easiest
job in the world

138
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:20,650
Being a mom
I love shopping.

139
00:06:21,152 --> 00:06:23,111
And sales is just
the other side of that

140
00:06:23,279 --> 00:06:25,072
That's true

141
00:06:25,782 --> 00:06:29,117
You know, if you joined
our sales department

142
00:06:29,202 --> 00:06:31,078
you would be working
very closely with our

143
00:06:31,204 --> 00:06:33,080
department head,
Mr. Dwight Schrute

144
00:06:33,164 --> 00:06:34,164
That's me

145
00:06:34,332 --> 00:06:37,209
Dwight, why don't you tell Susan
about some of your hobbies

146
00:06:37,627 --> 00:06:39,378
Oh Mmm-hmm Survival skills.

147
00:06:39,796 --> 00:06:41,213
Ranking of animals

148
00:06:41,422 --> 00:06:42,756
Maybe over a beer

149
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:45,801
after she's closed
her first sale.

150
00:06:47,011 --> 00:06:50,514
Well, make that a red wine and
I'll tell you my animal rankings

151
00:06:53,309 --> 00:06:56,103
How am I supposed
to pull this off?

152
00:06:56,479 --> 00:06:59,731
The entire office is being nicer to
her than they've ever been to me.

153
00:06:59,816 --> 00:07:01,441
What I wouldn't give
for one of Phyllis'

154
00:07:01,526 --> 00:07:03,318
classic room-clearing
farts right now.

155
00:07:04,654 --> 00:07:05,821
Ready?

156
00:07:09,534 --> 00:07:11,118
What do you think?
Huh?

157
00:07:11,202 --> 00:07:12,828
Umm, no

158
00:07:12,912 --> 00:07:14,079
No. This is not a gym

159
00:07:14,163 --> 00:07:15,789
This is like a
scene out of Saw V.

160
00:07:15,873 --> 00:07:17,332
You haven't even
looked around yet

161
00:07:17,417 --> 00:07:18,583
Look

162
00:07:18,835 --> 00:07:20,961
Gravel bucket squat yoke

163
00:07:24,632 --> 00:07:26,174
Right?

164
00:07:26,426 --> 00:07:27,426
Hmm

165
00:07:28,052 --> 00:07:29,845
Dedicated phone
book ripping station

166
00:07:32,473 --> 00:07:34,266
You ever cut tin before? No

167
00:07:34,642 --> 00:07:37,519
Five yards in and your
forearms will be on fire

168
00:07:37,728 --> 00:07:39,271
Plus, I will buy
the tin back from you

169
00:07:39,397 --> 00:07:40,981
that you cut for
two cents a yard

170
00:07:42,275 --> 00:07:44,109
Now, let's go
over membership

171
00:07:44,193 --> 00:07:45,861
I'm gonna need
the first month's

172
00:07:45,945 --> 00:07:48,280
and the last month's
up front for $49 a month

173
00:07:48,739 --> 00:07:51,324
But every third
month is $59 a month

174
00:07:51,451 --> 00:07:55,036
But the fourth month is a
discount month at $19 per month.

175
00:07:55,163 --> 00:07:57,622
Obviously, you know
how a gym works.

176
00:07:58,207 --> 00:08:00,167
So you know I'm not gonna
pay money for this

177
00:08:00,376 --> 00:08:01,918
You want people to
come to your gym?

178
00:08:02,211 --> 00:08:03,879
Make a real gym

179
00:08:04,297 --> 00:08:05,547
Darryl

180
00:08:08,509 --> 00:08:09,676
Make a real gym

181
00:08:09,886 --> 00:08:12,554
accounting might
be a good fit

182
00:08:12,638 --> 00:08:14,014
because I really
clicked with Oscar

183
00:08:14,098 --> 00:08:16,683
and I do have some
experience with bookkeeping

184
00:08:16,893 --> 00:08:20,228
But we already have a surplus
of accountants as it is

185
00:08:20,396 --> 00:08:23,899
customer service
um, HR, even.

186
00:08:23,983 --> 00:08:25,817
Those are fully
staffed as well

187
00:08:25,902 --> 00:08:29,488
Are you telling me that there's
no one in this entire office

188
00:08:29,572 --> 00:08:32,073
that could use
an extra pair of hands?

189
00:08:32,909 --> 00:08:33,992
Yes

190
00:08:34,076 --> 00:08:39,247
I am the CEO, and I am telling
an employee of mine what to do.

191
00:08:40,416 --> 00:08:42,626
Let me beat around
the bush for a second

192
00:08:43,085 --> 00:08:46,838
Our chairman of the board has
some very strong feelings

193
00:08:46,923 --> 00:08:49,674
Robert, it's all right.
This is very uncomfortable

194
00:08:49,759 --> 00:08:53,803
Obviously, there's no place for
me here, so thank you for trying

195
00:08:53,888 --> 00:08:54,888
Why don't we
just let it go?

196
00:08:55,014 --> 00:08:56,014
No.
Absolutely not

197
00:08:56,098 --> 00:08:58,558
Andrew, there must be
something you can do.

198
00:08:58,643 --> 00:08:59,976
There must be. Think

199
00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:03,897
Well, there are
a lot of considerations

200
00:09:09,111 --> 00:09:12,614
It's not a bad thing
to have the CEO owe you one

201
00:09:16,452 --> 00:09:19,287
All right
Well, then, welcome aboard

202
00:09:27,672 --> 00:09:28,797
So what happens next?

203
00:09:28,923 --> 00:09:33,426
We get you over to HR and then
get you set up with accounting.

204
00:09:34,637 --> 00:09:35,762
Hang on

205
00:09:35,888 --> 00:09:37,847
Hello?
- Say "hello, grandma."

206
00:09:39,934 --> 00:09:41,309
Hi, gam-gam

207
00:09:41,477 --> 00:09:44,020
Hold one finger up to Susan.
You'll just be a second.

208
00:09:45,439 --> 00:09:46,856
You numbskull!

209
00:09:46,941 --> 00:09:48,483
You were given
a very simple task.

210
00:09:48,568 --> 00:09:50,569
More clear with you.

211
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:52,904
Now say, "Are you
taking your medicine?"

212
00:09:53,364 --> 00:09:55,198
Are you taking your med-meds?

213
00:09:55,324 --> 00:09:58,201
Why can you not say
exactly what I tell you?

214
00:09:58,327 --> 00:10:01,413
Undo this. Undo it.

215
00:10:05,543 --> 00:10:07,168
You didn't say good-bye
to your grandmother.

216
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,796
We promised we'd
never say good-bye

217
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:17,137
Attention! I am
now accepting memberships

218
00:10:17,221 --> 00:10:19,431
for the Dwight Schrute
Gym for Muscles

219
00:10:19,849 --> 00:10:21,600
First 20 members
can take advantage

220
00:10:21,684 --> 00:10:23,768
of our "pay what
you weigh" promotion

221
00:10:23,853 --> 00:10:25,395
All I need
is another gym.

222
00:10:25,563 --> 00:10:26,730
As if I don't
have enough drama

223
00:10:26,856 --> 00:10:29,649
We have a gym at home
It's called the bedroom.

224
00:10:29,734 --> 00:10:30,859
Who's spotting who?

225
00:10:31,027 --> 00:10:32,360
"Don't use the bike
in the corner,

226
00:10:32,528 --> 00:10:33,903
"that's Bruce's.
Jeremy says...'

227
00:10:33,988 --> 00:10:35,322
Enough. Oscar, enough

228
00:10:35,406 --> 00:10:36,906
Kelly?
I have these sneakers

229
00:10:37,074 --> 00:10:39,451
which are basically just like
a gym for your feet, so...

230
00:10:42,455 --> 00:10:44,748
That's okay. I know
how to build a business

231
00:10:45,124 --> 00:10:46,541
You gotta bet the
black people to do it

232
00:10:46,709 --> 00:10:48,168
to get the white
people to do it.

233
00:10:48,586 --> 00:10:50,712
Then you gotta get the black
people to stop doing it.

234
00:10:51,339 --> 00:10:52,714
One step at a time

235
00:10:53,215 --> 00:10:54,883
Did you bring your
passport with you?

236
00:10:55,426 --> 00:10:56,718
Who walks around
with their passport?

237
00:10:56,802 --> 00:10:57,802
Well, I do

238
00:10:57,887 --> 00:10:58,970
Always ready
for adventure

239
00:10:59,055 --> 00:11:00,430
Have you had any?

240
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:01,681
No

241
00:11:06,395 --> 00:11:07,729
Hey, guys

242
00:11:08,356 --> 00:11:11,232
So Robert doesn't want
his wife working here.

243
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:13,818
So now that she is,
we have to drive her away

244
00:11:14,236 --> 00:11:18,031
Andy, if he didn't want her working
here, then why did you hire her?

245
00:11:18,282 --> 00:11:21,326
Oscar, it was a mistake

246
00:11:21,952 --> 00:11:25,246
But one that can be fixed by
all of us being mean to her.

247
00:11:25,498 --> 00:11:28,750
How can we do that?
She's simply wonderful

248
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:30,126
This is all pathetic

249
00:11:33,756 --> 00:11:35,173
How mean are
we talking about?

250
00:11:35,299 --> 00:11:36,424
It would be great if
she were gone by lunch

251
00:11:37,259 --> 00:11:39,886
Erin, you're up. Find her a place
to work but not too comfortable

252
00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:42,389
Got it. I know exactly
which stapler to give her.

253
00:11:46,727 --> 00:11:48,269
Here you go

254
00:11:51,941 --> 00:11:53,358
Um, do you think it
would be possible

255
00:11:53,484 --> 00:11:54,943
to move to that
desk over there?

256
00:11:55,027 --> 00:11:58,196
Because this seems a bit cramped,
and I don't have a computer

257
00:11:58,364 --> 00:11:59,698
Well, that's a sales desk

258
00:11:59,782 --> 00:12:02,575
Yeah. You need to be over
here with us accountants

259
00:12:02,993 --> 00:12:05,120
Just sit here
and be quiet

260
00:12:05,538 --> 00:12:08,289
And if you have a question
just raise your hand

261
00:12:08,999 --> 00:12:12,711
But I'm gonna save you some time,
sweetie, and give you the answer now

262
00:12:18,634 --> 00:12:20,051
No, I don't think
we should be trying

263
00:12:20,177 --> 00:12:21,594
to make this
place seem unpleasant.

264
00:12:21,804 --> 00:12:23,221
I think we should
let this place

265
00:12:23,347 --> 00:12:24,723
just crush her
spirit by itself

266
00:12:24,807 --> 00:12:26,433
what it's doing

267
00:12:26,851 --> 00:12:28,309
That's Gerald

268
00:12:28,477 --> 00:12:30,812
Oh, wow. So cute

269
00:12:30,896 --> 00:12:32,397
Oh, that is so cute

270
00:12:34,066 --> 00:12:36,651
Oh, he's so tiny
Is he in a ladle?

271
00:12:36,777 --> 00:12:37,902
Yeah, he's in a ladle

272
00:12:38,112 --> 00:12:40,238
That's adorable How on earth
did you get him in a ladle?

273
00:12:40,322 --> 00:12:41,531
He did it himself

274
00:12:41,615 --> 00:12:43,158
Is that ladle
stainless or

275
00:12:43,242 --> 00:12:44,451
Oh, stainless
Williams Sonoma

276
00:12:44,827 --> 00:12:46,995
Excuse me, waiter
there's a dog in my soup

277
00:12:47,079 --> 00:12:48,955
It's not that
kind of ladle

278
00:12:49,498 --> 00:12:51,082
Very cute
Let me see.

279
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:53,209
Just the battery
on these things

280
00:12:53,335 --> 00:12:55,086
I'm sorry,
I've gotta recharge this

281
00:12:56,839 --> 00:12:59,090
Last time I had a job

282
00:12:59,175 --> 00:13:01,092
I remember I hated
the boss' wife

283
00:13:02,470 --> 00:13:04,512
Of course, she was
married to Robert.

284
00:13:05,514 --> 00:13:10,351
Your employees don't
seem to be taking to me.

285
00:13:11,896 --> 00:13:13,021
Andy

286
00:13:15,566 --> 00:13:17,692
Andy, could you
step in here, please?

287
00:13:18,903 --> 00:13:20,028
We'll fix this

288
00:13:20,362 --> 00:13:22,447
What is going on?

289
00:13:22,531 --> 00:13:23,656
Please

290
00:13:24,533 --> 00:13:26,910
Ah, Andrew, my wife

291
00:13:27,369 --> 00:13:31,706
has brought up an issue that
requires your attention

292
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:36,878
So, if you'll excuse me
I should step out,

293
00:13:37,421 --> 00:13:42,050
get to the ATM before that homeless
man sets up camp for the night

294
00:13:47,431 --> 00:13:49,766
Okey-dokey, artichokey

295
00:13:51,811 --> 00:13:52,852
You hate it, don't you?

296
00:13:52,978 --> 00:13:54,062
Do you not want me here?

297
00:13:54,897 --> 00:13:56,356
Why would you say that?
It's okay.

298
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:58,316
I understand I'm not
sure how I would fee

299
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:00,318
about having the boss'
wife work for me either

300
00:14:00,486 --> 00:14:02,237
It's not that exactly

301
00:14:02,321 --> 00:14:03,613
But it is something

302
00:14:03,697 --> 00:14:07,116
Let's just say that if you
don't want to work here

303
00:14:07,201 --> 00:14:08,952
I am totally
prepared to respect that

304
00:14:09,036 --> 00:14:10,912
Why would you not
want me working here?

305
00:14:10,996 --> 00:14:12,455
I don't know

306
00:14:12,581 --> 00:14:16,751
what you're going through

307
00:14:17,503 --> 00:14:21,673
My husband can be a very
difficult man to read, can't he?

308
00:14:21,757 --> 00:14:22,799
Yes

309
00:14:24,218 --> 00:14:26,094
The dude is an enigma

310
00:14:26,595 --> 00:14:28,346
So he is mixed up
in this, isn't he?

311
00:14:31,267 --> 00:14:32,475
Got it

312
00:14:35,604 --> 00:14:36,938
What do you
think you're doing?

313
00:14:37,106 --> 00:14:38,273
Getting my sweat on

314
00:14:38,607 --> 00:14:40,650
I build you this
temple to the human body

315
00:14:40,776 --> 00:14:42,861
and you're lifting
what, five pounds?

316
00:14:42,945 --> 00:14:44,863
I just did, like,
35 minutes on the treadmill

317
00:14:44,947 --> 00:14:47,198
I was watching you. You want to
know how long it really was?

318
00:14:47,283 --> 00:14:48,741
No
Eight minutes!

319
00:14:48,826 --> 00:14:50,869
Dude, I'm gonna be
here all week, right?

320
00:14:51,245 --> 00:14:53,580
Five days a week. I figure I'll start slow

321
00:14:53,664 --> 00:14:56,332
Is that the same philosophy
you apply to buffalo wings?

322
00:14:59,128 --> 00:15:02,672
I want you to bring that same
buffalo wing passion to this gym

323
00:15:03,007 --> 00:15:05,466
I'm gonna make you
look like Lebron James

324
00:15:05,968 --> 00:15:07,594
It's Lejon Brames

325
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:09,429
That's what I said.
Yeah

326
00:15:10,014 --> 00:15:11,431
Get it right I know.

327
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:12,640
Cameras

328
00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:14,726
Still here. Terrific

329
00:15:16,061 --> 00:15:18,062
Andy and I had
a great conversation

330
00:15:19,398 --> 00:15:21,649
And I just want
to let you know

331
00:15:21,775 --> 00:15:24,027
that I am not going
to be working here

332
00:15:26,614 --> 00:15:27,655
Well, that's a shame

333
00:15:27,823 --> 00:15:29,699
It just was one of those things...
Is it?

334
00:15:30,743 --> 00:15:31,993
Because we
talked about it

335
00:15:32,077 --> 00:15:33,995
and it seems like that
might be what you want.

336
00:15:34,163 --> 00:15:35,872
Which is fine
Where did this come from?

337
00:15:35,998 --> 00:15:37,081
Did Andy say that?

338
00:15:37,166 --> 00:15:38,333
No, he did not

339
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:39,709
But I could tell
he was struggling

340
00:15:39,835 --> 00:15:41,044
to understand what
was expected of him

341
00:15:41,128 --> 00:15:44,505
What's the struggle? He made a
great call hired a great person

342
00:15:44,590 --> 00:15:46,007
You sure about that?

343
00:15:46,508 --> 00:15:48,092
Absolutely.
No games?

344
00:15:48,427 --> 00:15:49,510
No games

345
00:15:49,762 --> 00:15:51,846
Because Andy seemed to think
there was some information

346
00:15:51,931 --> 00:15:53,556
he was not able
to share with me

347
00:15:53,641 --> 00:15:55,183
Enough of this I
mean, real Enough

348
00:15:55,267 --> 00:15:58,353
It's gotten way out of hand
Andrew, this is my wife

349
00:15:58,812 --> 00:16:02,857
Whatever privacy you were trying to
protect between us, I thank you for

350
00:16:03,067 --> 00:16:05,276
But it is not
welcome right now

351
00:16:05,527 --> 00:16:07,362
Just be honest

352
00:16:10,324 --> 00:16:12,033
Andy
Yes

353
00:16:12,201 --> 00:16:13,701
Why do you keep
looking at my husband?

354
00:16:13,827 --> 00:16:15,328
Andy, just answer
the question.

355
00:16:15,579 --> 00:16:16,579
No games?

356
00:16:16,664 --> 00:16:17,747
No games

357
00:16:19,041 --> 00:16:20,208
Okay

358
00:16:20,918 --> 00:16:22,961
of funny, actually.

359
00:16:23,045 --> 00:16:24,796
Robert storms in
and he says

360
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:26,214
"In four seconds
my wife's gonna be in here

361
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:27,465
"I told her she
could work here

362
00:16:27,549 --> 00:16:29,759
"Under no circumstances can
that be allowed to happen."

363
00:16:29,969 --> 00:16:31,469
You lying son of a bitch

364
00:16:35,891 --> 00:16:37,308
Tell my wife you're lying

365
00:16:41,522 --> 00:16:42,480
That's not true, is it?

366
00:16:42,564 --> 00:16:44,065
No, it's not

367
00:16:44,984 --> 00:16:46,859
I tell the truth
most of the time

368
00:16:46,944 --> 00:16:49,070
and I was just telling the
truth about your husband

369
00:16:49,196 --> 00:16:50,613
Jim knows. He was there

370
00:16:50,739 --> 00:16:52,156
This is preposterous

371
00:16:52,241 --> 00:16:54,075
Robert
Let's get Jim in here.

372
00:16:56,662 --> 00:16:57,787
Where's Jim?

373
00:16:57,871 --> 00:16:59,706
He just rolled out
and crawled out

374
00:17:00,249 --> 00:17:03,126
Can you call security tell them
to keep an eye out for him?

375
00:17:03,669 --> 00:17:04,877
Time to settle this

376
00:17:06,755 --> 00:17:07,964
Wait, wait, wait
Hold on, hold on

377
00:17:09,425 --> 00:17:12,593
Just real quick.
Real quick, open... Okay

378
00:17:18,267 --> 00:17:19,809
That's weird

379
00:17:20,728 --> 00:17:22,603
Well, he's gotta be
around here somewhere

380
00:17:31,864 --> 00:17:33,948
Ow! Ow

381
00:17:34,450 --> 00:17:35,450
Ow

382
00:17:41,915 --> 00:17:43,624
Creed, I was never
here, all right?

383
00:17:43,709 --> 00:17:46,085
Okay. What about
your friend?

384
00:17:47,838 --> 00:17:49,130
Oh, boy

385
00:17:53,302 --> 00:17:56,971
This is my gym, my rules You do
exactly as I say no questions asked

386
00:17:57,598 --> 00:17:58,890
Yeah, I'm gonna
ask questions,

387
00:17:58,974 --> 00:18:00,475
and I might not
do what you say

388
00:18:00,642 --> 00:18:03,269
First thing, we're gonna
stretch the pelvic bowl

389
00:18:03,854 --> 00:18:06,105
Ready? Get down on the floor

390
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:07,940
Okay, I'm not doing that

391
00:18:09,151 --> 00:18:10,359
Really?

392
00:18:10,444 --> 00:18:12,153
Too embarrassing
for you? Huh?

393
00:18:12,237 --> 00:18:15,073
You wish that every exercise was
strutting around the gym like the Fonz?

394
00:18:15,199 --> 00:18:17,325
Well, how do you think
the Fonz got so cool?

395
00:18:17,618 --> 00:18:19,619
He stretched
his pelvic bowl

396
00:18:22,331 --> 00:18:23,581
Darryl joined

397
00:18:23,832 --> 00:18:24,832
Looks that way

398
00:18:25,125 --> 00:18:27,335
Nice pelvic bowl. Deep

399
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:31,506
Hello, Jim

400
00:18:31,673 --> 00:18:32,840
No, no. No, no, no

401
00:18:33,133 --> 00:18:34,675
Don't. Damn it, Tuna

402
00:18:35,010 --> 00:18:38,221
So, I think you know
what we want to know

403
00:18:38,472 --> 00:18:39,722
Do I?
Yes

404
00:18:39,807 --> 00:18:41,057
I know. I do

405
00:18:41,725 --> 00:18:45,019
Jim, I've had enough
of your unhelpfulness

406
00:18:46,855 --> 00:18:48,272
I'm not really sure how I can

407
00:18:48,357 --> 00:18:50,316
For God's sake,
did Robert tell you

408
00:18:50,442 --> 00:18:52,401
that he didn't
want me working here?

409
00:18:52,653 --> 00:18:54,195
That's the thing

410
00:18:54,279 --> 00:18:56,656
See, I didn't want to get in the
middle of this Still don't.

411
00:18:56,782 --> 00:18:58,991
But here's something

412
00:18:59,076 --> 00:19:02,245
I feel that maybe,
if we take a step back

413
00:19:03,038 --> 00:19:06,916
this is a simple case of
anxiety to work with a spouse

414
00:19:07,209 --> 00:19:09,627
I think we've got
ourselves an answer

415
00:19:09,711 --> 00:19:11,754
No That makes complete
sense, right?

416
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:13,548
Thank you all for a
wonderful day Perfect!

417
00:19:13,882 --> 00:19:14,966
Jim
Yes?

418
00:19:15,050 --> 00:19:16,092
Answer the question
please.

419
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:20,930
Want me to tell you.

420
00:19:21,265 --> 00:19:23,641
To be really honest,
my wife works here

421
00:19:24,017 --> 00:19:25,268
And I love it

422
00:19:25,394 --> 00:19:27,311
She literally
makes me work harder

423
00:19:27,479 --> 00:19:30,106
She makes me smarter. She makes
me remember why I'm here

424
00:19:31,191 --> 00:19:34,235
And between us she's on
maternity leave right now

425
00:19:34,444 --> 00:19:36,571
and I would love to leave
this room and see her face

426
00:19:39,408 --> 00:19:40,408
but it's just
what I'm thinking

427
00:19:40,492 --> 00:19:41,701
All right. Thanks

428
00:19:41,952 --> 00:19:43,494
Yes. All right

429
00:19:50,043 --> 00:19:51,043
Uh.

430
00:19:51,128 --> 00:19:53,212
Yeah

431
00:19:59,469 --> 00:20:00,887
Thank you

432
00:20:10,564 --> 00:20:11,647
Andy

433
00:20:12,482 --> 00:20:14,066
Hey, Mrs. California

434
00:20:14,151 --> 00:20:18,946
Hey. I'm sorry about the
position you were put in today.

435
00:20:19,615 --> 00:20:21,490
You know, honestly we all
wanted you to work there

436
00:20:22,492 --> 00:20:24,285
Except for him
Especially me

437
00:20:25,078 --> 00:20:26,829
Yes, I thought we
really hit it off.

438
00:20:26,955 --> 00:20:28,080
Yeah

439
00:20:28,999 --> 00:20:30,124
Well, different circumstances

440
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:31,375
Yeah

441
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:32,835
Who knows?
Who knows?

442
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:35,254
Maybe after all
this settles down

443
00:20:35,505 --> 00:20:36,756
Totally

444
00:20:38,008 --> 00:20:39,217
It's a date

445
00:20:39,301 --> 00:20:40,301
Hmm?

446
00:20:42,512 --> 00:20:44,055
You're nothing!
You're so weak

447
00:20:44,139 --> 00:20:46,140
You call yourself
a man? Huh?

448
00:20:46,225 --> 00:20:48,434
This doesn't help me I don't
respond to that kind of strategy.

449
00:20:48,518 --> 00:20:49,560
Okay, fine

450
00:20:49,645 --> 00:20:52,897
Finish your set on your own and
never come back to my gym again!

451
00:20:53,857 --> 00:20:55,358
Dwight, come back and spot me

452
00:20:56,818 --> 00:20:58,486
All right, I'll help you

453
00:20:59,571 --> 00:21:01,781
But first, you gotta
tell me what your goal is

454
00:21:01,865 --> 00:21:02,865
What do you want?

455
00:21:02,991 --> 00:21:03,991
To push this bar up

456
00:21:04,076 --> 00:21:07,119
No! Because if that was the case,
the bar would be up by now

457
00:21:07,329 --> 00:21:08,412
What is your goal?

458
00:21:08,538 --> 00:21:09,664
Help me

459
00:21:09,873 --> 00:21:11,540
What do you want?

460
00:21:11,667 --> 00:21:13,334
To look good for Val

461
00:21:13,794 --> 00:21:15,169
Val Kilmer?

462
00:21:15,254 --> 00:21:17,463
I don't buy it
that doesn't make any sense

463
00:21:19,299 --> 00:21:20,383
Wow

464
00:21:21,051 --> 00:21:22,510
I figured out your goal

465
00:21:24,012 --> 00:21:27,223
I am gonna make you the buffest
dude Val Kilmer has ever seen
