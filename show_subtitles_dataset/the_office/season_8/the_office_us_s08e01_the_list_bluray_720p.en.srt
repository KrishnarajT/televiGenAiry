1
00:00:02,824 --> 00:00:04,116
Oh, for god's sake

2
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:09,246
Planking is a very stupid
and dangerous trend

3
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:11,457
Basically you lie like
a plank in weird places

4
00:00:12,167 --> 00:00:13,208
That's it.

5
00:00:13,293 --> 00:00:14,835
Sometimes you get run over

6
00:00:15,587 --> 00:00:16,754
Welcome to the Internet

7
00:00:17,297 --> 00:00:19,631
Planking is one of
those things where

8
00:00:19,966 --> 00:00:22,301
hey, you either
get it or you don't

9
00:00:23,636 --> 00:00:26,472
And I don't. But I am so
excited to be a part of it.

10
00:00:29,893 --> 00:00:30,893
After you
my good sir

11
00:00:30,977 --> 00:00:31,977
No, I insist

12
00:00:32,062 --> 00:00:33,771
The search committee
finally decided,

13
00:00:33,855 --> 00:00:35,564
after a lot of deliberation

14
00:00:35,648 --> 00:00:38,984
on Robert California
for the manager position

15
00:00:40,195 --> 00:00:42,988
Who took one look
around and left.

16
00:00:43,782 --> 00:00:47,868
He drove down to Florida and
convinced Jo to make him C.E.O

17
00:00:50,705 --> 00:00:53,165
C.E.O. Her own job

18
00:00:53,875 --> 00:00:55,125
He talked her
out of her own job

19
00:00:55,210 --> 00:00:57,044
and I don't really know
how someone does that

20
00:00:57,170 --> 00:01:00,339
but anyway then the
position was his to fill

21
00:01:01,007 --> 00:01:02,591
and he chose

22
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,265
It's unbelievable

23
00:01:11,101 --> 00:01:13,102
True. I may have
been tee second choice,

24
00:01:13,186 --> 00:01:15,395
but I was the first
choice's first choice.

25
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:16,772
And about Dwight,

26
00:01:16,856 --> 00:01:19,775
have some resentment
about not getting the job

27
00:01:19,859 --> 00:01:21,193
so I sat him down
and we had a talk

28
00:01:21,402 --> 00:01:24,113
And I told him, "I need a
really strong number two

29
00:01:24,197 --> 00:01:25,447
"I want you to
be my enforcer.'

30
00:01:26,074 --> 00:01:27,574
Smart, right?
Very smart

31
00:01:30,495 --> 00:01:31,703
This has got to stop

32
00:01:33,039 --> 00:01:34,873
Hey! Kevin

33
00:01:36,668 --> 00:01:39,962
Yeah, at first I was
really disappointed

34
00:01:40,046 --> 00:01:42,840
But I've got a great daily
routine going right now

35
00:01:42,924 --> 00:01:44,633
I've upped my karate
to eight times a week.

36
00:01:44,717 --> 00:01:46,760
I've added boxing at
lunches and on weekends,

37
00:01:46,845 --> 00:01:49,930
I do kick-boxing three times a
week, Krav Maga four times a week,

38
00:01:50,014 --> 00:01:52,432
an hour of meditation
every morning at sunrise,

39
00:01:52,517 --> 00:01:54,059
and again at sunset.

40
00:01:54,144 --> 00:01:57,062
So yeah
I'm doing great

41
00:01:57,897 --> 00:01:59,273
I'm going to need
some help. Pam?

42
00:02:02,569 --> 00:02:04,820
Oh, yeah. Pregnant

43
00:02:04,904 --> 00:02:06,822
Right here.
Little Michael Scott

44
00:02:06,906 --> 00:02:09,199
Nope. I told you I
don't like that joke

45
00:02:09,284 --> 00:02:10,993
It is a boy.
We found out early

46
00:02:11,077 --> 00:02:13,704
Much different
the second time around

47
00:02:13,788 --> 00:02:15,831
And I have to say
it is nice not being

48
00:02:15,915 --> 00:02:17,624
the only pregnant
woman in the office

49
00:02:18,877 --> 00:02:22,504
Look, it's "little
pregs" and "big pregs."

50
00:02:23,047 --> 00:02:24,506
Wait, when did we start
calling each other

51
00:02:24,591 --> 00:02:27,176
Isn't it amazing the
difference in our sizes?

52
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:29,011
Well, I am a few
months ahead of you

53
00:02:29,095 --> 00:02:31,763
I'm having a child with
my husband the senator

54
00:02:31,848 --> 00:02:36,435
And Pam is having a child
with Jim The great salesman

55
00:02:36,519 --> 00:02:38,103
Hoist him aloft

56
00:02:38,938 --> 00:02:40,772
Come on, Darryl, lift
Lift, Darryl

57
00:02:40,857 --> 00:02:42,149
Come on, man

58
00:02:42,233 --> 00:02:45,652
Yeah, I wanted the manager job,
but I got something much better

59
00:02:48,072 --> 00:02:49,239
This soda

60
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,408
This is mine

61
00:02:51,868 --> 00:02:56,288
It might be easier if you take a
deep breath lift from the knees,

62
00:02:56,372 --> 00:02:57,915
and shove it
up your butt

63
00:02:59,918 --> 00:03:01,418
a new thing this summer

64
00:03:01,502 --> 00:03:03,962
I act like I'm telling
someone how to do something.

65
00:03:04,047 --> 00:03:07,382
A long description
and then I say...

66
00:03:07,467 --> 00:03:09,176
And shove it up your butt

67
00:03:11,596 --> 00:03:14,473
It's stupid,
but it's my thing now

68
00:03:14,557 --> 00:03:16,850
No one should be
planking at all.

69
00:03:16,935 --> 00:03:18,477
Thank you. Yes

70
00:03:19,604 --> 00:03:22,564
Dwight my enforcer, my number
two can you take care of this?

71
00:03:22,649 --> 00:03:23,857
Say no more

72
00:03:35,203 --> 00:03:37,996
Kids, don't try planking
it's dangerous.

73
00:03:39,832 --> 00:03:41,333
Especially with me around

74
00:04:12,448 --> 00:04:13,532
Are you watching
that commercial again?

75
00:04:16,202 --> 00:04:18,996
Why do you keep watching it if you
know it's just going to make you cry?

76
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:21,957
Because everything makes me
cry so what's the difference?

77
00:04:23,376 --> 00:04:26,878
This dog he just wants
to protect his bone

78
00:04:27,213 --> 00:04:28,964
He's got a bank vault
That's a start.

79
00:04:29,048 --> 00:04:30,007
Not enough, though

80
00:04:30,091 --> 00:04:31,091
All right

81
00:04:36,973 --> 00:04:39,808
The new C.E.O. works out of the
conference room about half the time

82
00:04:39,892 --> 00:04:44,062
but whenever he takes a break he does
these weird walks around the office.

83
00:04:44,605 --> 00:04:46,273
And you never know who
he's going to zero in on

84
00:04:46,357 --> 00:04:48,525
for these really
intense small talks

85
00:04:48,609 --> 00:04:50,902
You just hope
it's not you.

86
00:04:51,654 --> 00:04:55,365
And yet you hope it is
you, too It's strange

87
00:05:02,081 --> 00:05:03,749
Here we go.
Hello

88
00:05:04,292 --> 00:05:06,918
Robert California.
Let's have a conversation

89
00:05:07,295 --> 00:05:08,837
Describe your day so far

90
00:05:08,921 --> 00:05:10,630
Well, I woke up and

91
00:05:10,715 --> 00:05:13,050
When you recount your day,
never say you woke up

92
00:05:13,134 --> 00:05:14,343
It's a waste of your time

93
00:05:14,427 --> 00:05:17,429
That's how every day has begun for
everyone since the dawn of man.

94
00:05:17,513 --> 00:05:19,848
Very smart
Very smart

95
00:05:21,517 --> 00:05:25,103
Suddenly, I was awake
and I...

96
00:05:25,188 --> 00:05:30,817
Hey, Robert We have that 9:30 A.M.
casual chit chat scheduled

97
00:05:30,902 --> 00:05:34,404
I emailed you about it last eight
to confirm. And again this morning

98
00:05:34,489 --> 00:05:36,490
First item on the agenda
can I get everyone

99
00:05:36,574 --> 00:05:38,533
an extra long
Columbus Day weekend?

100
00:05:38,618 --> 00:05:40,952
Item number two,
connect with the guy

101
00:05:41,662 --> 00:05:44,331
Robert California,
what does he think of me?

102
00:05:44,415 --> 00:05:45,791
Don't know
Super care.

103
00:05:47,251 --> 00:05:49,586
Number three, time permitting
we lost our biggest client.

104
00:06:02,809 --> 00:06:04,935
Pam. Pam
Past! Pam.

105
00:06:20,201 --> 00:06:21,201
Jim

106
00:06:30,795 --> 00:06:34,464
Can I call you right back?
Thank you very much.

107
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:36,800
Okay

108
00:06:40,096 --> 00:06:41,263
What is this?

109
00:06:43,975 --> 00:06:46,435
The Friday before
Columbus Day, thoughts?

110
00:06:46,519 --> 00:06:47,644
What are your thoughts?

111
00:06:47,728 --> 00:06:49,062
Just making chit-chat

112
00:06:50,648 --> 00:06:53,400
Kind of a medium year
for women's soccer, no?

113
00:06:56,446 --> 00:06:57,571
What are you looking at?

114
00:06:58,364 --> 00:06:59,739
It's nothing

115
00:06:59,866 --> 00:07:01,950
It can't be nothing
Yeah, it can't be nothing.

116
00:07:02,034 --> 00:07:04,661
It's just a list of our names
split into two columns

117
00:07:04,745 --> 00:07:06,204
What?

118
00:07:06,289 --> 00:07:08,874
Okay, just wait one second all right?
I will copy it

119
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:11,209
Do you have a pen?
No

120
00:07:11,294 --> 00:07:12,335
No

121
00:07:13,129 --> 00:07:15,338
Okay. Um, I'll take
a photo of it.

122
00:07:15,631 --> 00:07:16,756
Dwight, can you
throw me my phone?

123
00:07:20,887 --> 00:07:22,220
Nice catch

124
00:07:22,889 --> 00:07:24,389
If he comes out
distract him.

125
00:07:24,891 --> 00:07:26,475
We need a warning signal

126
00:07:26,559 --> 00:07:28,268
We don't need
a warning signal, Kevin

127
00:07:28,394 --> 00:07:29,478
We can see him right there.
- We do.

128
00:07:29,562 --> 00:07:30,562
Don't need a...

129
00:07:30,646 --> 00:07:33,815
Warning! Warning Warning!
Warning! Warning

130
00:07:34,192 --> 00:07:35,650
Phyllis!
Phyllis

131
00:07:37,695 --> 00:07:38,945
You okay?

132
00:07:41,449 --> 00:07:42,741
You okay?
Yeah. Yeah.

133
00:07:42,825 --> 00:07:44,242
One, two, three

134
00:07:44,327 --> 00:07:45,368
Thanks, guys

135
00:07:49,081 --> 00:07:52,125
Okay. Which side
of the list am I on?

136
00:07:52,752 --> 00:07:54,252
Left
Yes

137
00:07:54,337 --> 00:07:56,588
Why are you...
How do you know?

138
00:07:57,924 --> 00:07:59,966
Really great
list of names, guys

139
00:08:00,635 --> 00:08:02,385
Thank you so much
Good work.

140
00:08:02,470 --> 00:08:05,180
No, actually, that was
in Robert's notebook.

141
00:08:05,264 --> 00:08:07,265
He left it at reception
and we photocopied it

142
00:08:07,642 --> 00:08:08,683
Oh

143
00:08:08,768 --> 00:08:11,728
Okay. I don't want
any part of this.

144
00:08:11,812 --> 00:08:14,189
Maybe it's the list of people
he's going to fire.

145
00:08:14,357 --> 00:08:16,691
Okay.
It's not that, Pam

146
00:08:17,485 --> 00:08:19,027
You know I was
thinking it reminds me

147
00:08:19,111 --> 00:08:20,570
of those lists
Dwight used to make

148
00:08:20,655 --> 00:08:22,447
This is if we were a
on a cruise ship

149
00:08:22,532 --> 00:08:24,282
and had to divide
into life boats.

150
00:08:24,408 --> 00:08:25,909
And this is if we
were on a cruise ship

151
00:08:25,993 --> 00:08:27,744
and had to divide
into life rafts.

152
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:32,290
Here's something "Who would eat
who in an Alive situation?'

153
00:08:35,545 --> 00:08:37,712
No. That can't be it

154
00:08:37,797 --> 00:08:38,755
I gotta say

155
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:41,841
it kind of seems like the left
side is the side to be on

156
00:08:42,343 --> 00:08:44,886
Me, Jim, Dwight, Darryl
no offense, Pam.

157
00:08:44,971 --> 00:08:46,638
Excuse me?

158
00:08:46,722 --> 00:08:48,682
Shh. Pam, come on Don't
be such a right-sider.

159
00:08:50,768 --> 00:08:52,811
Did you guys figure it out?
We couldn't crack it

160
00:08:52,895 --> 00:08:55,480
Go in there, just ask
the man what it means

161
00:08:55,565 --> 00:08:59,776
He'll know that we looked
at his private notebook

162
00:09:00,361 --> 00:09:02,320
Come on Just say you saw
the list by accident

163
00:09:02,405 --> 00:09:04,739
I'm already working on this
Columbus Day thing for you guys

164
00:09:04,824 --> 00:09:07,242
And it's starting
to stack up.

165
00:09:07,326 --> 00:09:08,910
It feels like a lot
One thing at a time

166
00:09:08,995 --> 00:09:11,955
Yeah, that's all you had to do
today is ask about Columbus Day?

167
00:09:17,003 --> 00:09:19,421
Yes. For god's sake
Andy, yes. Come in.

168
00:09:22,341 --> 00:09:23,967
What's up?

169
00:09:24,051 --> 00:09:26,469
Weird thing.
Totally awkward

170
00:09:27,346 --> 00:09:30,098
But you left your notebook
on the reception desk.

171
00:09:30,182 --> 00:09:31,224
Great. Thank you

172
00:09:31,309 --> 00:09:33,977
And it was open

173
00:09:35,187 --> 00:09:37,147
and people saw this

174
00:09:37,231 --> 00:09:39,190
and they're just kind of
going nuts and, like...

175
00:09:39,275 --> 00:09:40,275
What is this?

176
00:09:40,359 --> 00:09:41,318
wondering what it is

177
00:09:41,402 --> 00:09:43,445
It's a photocopy
from your notebook

178
00:09:43,529 --> 00:09:47,157
You read my notebook? And
photocopied it and distributed it?

179
00:09:48,868 --> 00:09:53,663
No. They did. And they asked
me to ask you about it

180
00:09:54,081 --> 00:09:55,707
Please

181
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:59,044
Oh

182
00:09:59,337 --> 00:10:01,087
Here's what it is
it's a doodle.

183
00:10:01,589 --> 00:10:02,631
What?

184
00:10:02,715 --> 00:10:06,051
Some people doodle at work
when they let their mind run

185
00:10:06,135 --> 00:10:07,677
They draw houses, penises

186
00:10:07,762 --> 00:10:10,764
funny how the houses
are always colonials

187
00:10:10,848 --> 00:10:12,557
and the penises are
always circumcised

188
00:10:12,642 --> 00:10:14,601
Don't you think?

189
00:10:15,227 --> 00:10:19,230
Well, I doodle too but I'm not an
artist so I draw words and lists

190
00:10:20,858 --> 00:10:23,735
That is fascinating

191
00:10:23,819 --> 00:10:25,945
And by the way
I am so glad I asked

192
00:10:26,030 --> 00:10:28,615
People were just sort of...
Did you just move my name?

193
00:10:28,699 --> 00:10:31,493
Might as well have
been sketching a cube

194
00:10:37,083 --> 00:10:39,084
Okay, Robert's in the annex
everybody think quick

195
00:10:39,168 --> 00:10:40,502
What do these
groups have in common?

196
00:10:40,586 --> 00:10:42,504
Maybe we're supposed to do
it with people in our group.

197
00:10:42,588 --> 00:10:43,880
That's not it

198
00:10:43,964 --> 00:10:45,131
People in
the other group

199
00:10:45,216 --> 00:10:46,549
Mmm. Still wrong

200
00:10:46,634 --> 00:10:49,386
Stanley, you do puzzles
all day What do we got?

201
00:10:49,470 --> 00:10:51,680
Well, you take the first
letter from each name

202
00:10:51,764 --> 00:10:54,140
assign it a number
add them all up,

203
00:10:54,225 --> 00:10:55,892
and shove it up your butt

204
00:10:55,976 --> 00:10:58,353
Thank you, a little
much needed comic relief

205
00:10:58,437 --> 00:11:00,730
But we really need to
figure this out, guys

206
00:11:03,109 --> 00:11:04,567
It's alphabetical

207
00:11:06,404 --> 00:11:07,487
No, it's not

208
00:11:07,571 --> 00:11:08,571
Here's how we find out

209
00:11:08,656 --> 00:11:10,323
Let's line up and
compare the lines

210
00:11:10,408 --> 00:11:11,658
see if we learn
anything, okay?

211
00:11:11,742 --> 00:11:14,119
Left-siders over here
right-siders line up over here,

212
00:11:14,203 --> 00:11:15,203
face each other

213
00:11:15,287 --> 00:11:17,706
Match up by height
and relative weight

214
00:11:18,374 --> 00:11:21,167
Let's just size
each other up here

215
00:11:21,252 --> 00:11:23,753
And left side of the list

216
00:11:24,588 --> 00:11:25,797
attack

217
00:11:25,881 --> 00:11:27,966
Wait, wait, wait,
stop, stop!

218
00:11:28,217 --> 00:11:29,634
Will you stop?

219
00:11:30,886 --> 00:11:31,886
Dwight

220
00:11:32,138 --> 00:11:33,138
Don't do it

221
00:11:33,973 --> 00:11:34,973
What are you doing?
Stop!

222
00:11:35,808 --> 00:11:38,143
Warning! Warning! Warning

223
00:11:43,482 --> 00:11:48,027
I'd like to invite the following
people to join me for lunch.

224
00:11:48,696 --> 00:11:50,530
Jim, Dwight

225
00:11:50,614 --> 00:11:53,283
Angela, Darryl

226
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:57,829
Kevin, Toby
Phyllis, Oscar

227
00:11:59,915 --> 00:12:02,459
That's great.
Let's do this, guys

228
00:12:03,753 --> 00:12:07,297
All right. Well,
I will see you in a bit

229
00:12:08,674 --> 00:12:12,260
Hey, it's nothing
all right?

230
00:12:12,678 --> 00:12:13,762
I'll text you
when we get there

231
00:12:13,846 --> 00:12:15,805
I'll let you know
what's going on Okay

232
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:17,682
No. No dog video

233
00:12:18,017 --> 00:12:19,184
Okay
Okay.

234
00:12:20,019 --> 00:12:21,019
See you, guys

235
00:12:23,272 --> 00:12:26,399
Well, we should a
be really excited about

236
00:12:26,484 --> 00:12:30,236
our very own pizza party

237
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:35,283
Pizza party Pizza party.
Pizza party.

238
00:12:35,367 --> 00:12:38,578
Jim, your daughter Cecelia what
does she think of the Street?

239
00:12:38,662 --> 00:12:40,163
The street?

240
00:12:40,247 --> 00:12:41,372
Sesame Street.

241
00:12:41,457 --> 00:12:43,458
Oh. I didn't know
anybody called it

242
00:12:43,542 --> 00:12:44,793
She likes it a lot

243
00:12:44,877 --> 00:12:46,419
She loves Elmo

244
00:12:46,504 --> 00:12:48,797
Elmo, God save us the Elmo era

245
00:12:48,881 --> 00:12:49,881
Right?

246
00:12:49,965 --> 00:12:51,633
Sesame Street was
created to reflect

247
00:12:51,717 --> 00:12:53,301
the environment of
the children watching it

248
00:12:54,428 --> 00:12:56,012
Complete self
absorption of Elmo

249
00:12:56,096 --> 00:12:58,014
is brilliantly
reflective of our time

250
00:12:58,682 --> 00:13:01,184
Ours is a cultural ghetto
Wouldn't you agree?

251
00:13:01,811 --> 00:13:04,771
Yeah. She does like Elmo

252
00:13:04,855 --> 00:13:08,024
Cultural ghetto?
Totally agree

253
00:13:08,108 --> 00:13:09,192
Completely

254
00:13:09,276 --> 00:13:11,736
Apt. Apt analysis, Robert

255
00:13:11,821 --> 00:13:15,573
The thing that I like about
Elmo is the tickling

256
00:13:16,951 --> 00:13:20,662
I don't know
I was in the wrong...

257
00:13:20,996 --> 00:13:23,414
I'm... I'm sorry

258
00:13:23,499 --> 00:13:26,376
Just picture me back there.
I was never here

259
00:13:30,130 --> 00:13:32,590
Great group
Pizza party.

260
00:13:32,758 --> 00:13:33,758
How is this a pizza party?

261
00:13:33,843 --> 00:13:35,051
Well, why don't you
ask me again

262
00:13:35,135 --> 00:13:36,302
when the five pizzas
get here?

263
00:13:36,387 --> 00:13:37,470
Yeah, well,
that's just pizza

264
00:13:37,555 --> 00:13:39,681
You need at least one other
element for it to be a party.

265
00:13:39,765 --> 00:13:41,516
Okay. Have you guys
ever had margarita pizza?

266
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:42,600
What's that?

267
00:13:42,685 --> 00:13:46,771
Fresh tomato with a dollop
of mozzarella cheese.

268
00:13:46,856 --> 00:13:48,022
That's pizza

269
00:13:48,107 --> 00:13:49,983
That's regular pizza

270
00:13:50,067 --> 00:13:52,694
You know, I fee comfortable enough
now to ask you this question,

271
00:13:52,778 --> 00:13:55,363
what made you
pick this group?

272
00:13:55,447 --> 00:13:57,282
I just think
you guys are winners

273
00:13:57,366 --> 00:13:58,533
and I wanted to
have lunch with you

274
00:13:58,617 --> 00:13:59,701
Okay

275
00:13:59,869 --> 00:14:00,869
Aw.

276
00:14:01,370 --> 00:14:03,079
What about the other guys?

277
00:14:03,163 --> 00:14:05,707
Losers? Come on.
Oh, I don't know

278
00:14:05,791 --> 00:14:07,208
Come on. Come on

279
00:14:07,293 --> 00:14:08,960
I guess I think
they're losers.

280
00:14:09,461 --> 00:14:11,462
I knew it

281
00:14:11,547 --> 00:14:12,547
Yes

282
00:14:12,631 --> 00:14:14,090
Probably shouldn't
have said that

283
00:14:14,633 --> 00:14:15,717
Whoo-hoo

284
00:14:16,135 --> 00:14:18,845
Ah-ha! Their interpretation
of margherita pizza

285
00:14:20,014 --> 00:14:21,806
Fans of classic pizza
will be psyched.

286
00:14:23,726 --> 00:14:25,685
A text from Jim

287
00:14:25,769 --> 00:14:28,479
"This is getting very weird
Will explain later."

288
00:14:33,235 --> 00:14:34,360
Text from Kevin

289
00:14:34,445 --> 00:14:35,570
"Suck it, losers.'

290
00:14:40,826 --> 00:14:42,869
RYAN Okay, not to point out
the glaringly obvious,

291
00:14:42,953 --> 00:14:45,288
but doesn't the fact
that lama in this group

292
00:14:45,372 --> 00:14:47,665
make anyone feel just
a little bit better?

293
00:14:49,001 --> 00:14:50,585
Oh, this crust is sharp

294
00:14:50,669 --> 00:14:55,340
and sort of funny

295
00:14:56,175 --> 00:14:58,259
and I could do those
cute little cartoons

296
00:14:58,344 --> 00:15:01,846
and everyone who came
through here was like,

297
00:15:01,931 --> 00:15:04,015
"Who's that receptionist? I like her."

298
00:15:04,683 --> 00:15:06,559
Now I'm just a fat mom

299
00:15:07,603 --> 00:15:11,064
Yeah, and you take one look at
me and you're like, "Oh, loser."

300
00:15:11,148 --> 00:15:12,690
Come here, Pam

301
00:15:14,151 --> 00:15:15,276
Chins up, okay?

302
00:15:15,361 --> 00:15:17,862
Bad joke

303
00:15:19,239 --> 00:15:20,573
Look around this room

304
00:15:20,658 --> 00:15:23,201
Does this look like a group of losers?
Seriously.

305
00:15:30,584 --> 00:15:31,793
Oh, god

306
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:36,798
Oh, hey, guys
we had so much fun.

307
00:15:36,882 --> 00:15:38,216
We had marguerite pizza

308
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:39,968
We all hung out and got
to know each other better

309
00:15:40,052 --> 00:15:41,010
How was your lunch?

310
00:15:41,095 --> 00:15:43,012
It was excellent.
Good times

311
00:15:43,097 --> 00:15:44,263
Yeah?
Yeah.

312
00:15:44,348 --> 00:15:46,265
Oh, we did.
It was the best time

313
00:15:46,350 --> 00:15:49,978
And you know what? Now it's
over back to work, everyone

314
00:15:51,063 --> 00:15:52,063
You too, Andy

315
00:15:52,731 --> 00:15:53,690
I knew it.

316
00:15:53,774 --> 00:15:57,819
That everyone
was wrong about me.

317
00:15:58,112 --> 00:16:03,324
My parents, my teachers, my
friends the doctors, everyone.

318
00:16:04,326 --> 00:16:06,244
Well, that was
certainly an odd lunch

319
00:16:10,749 --> 00:16:11,749
Is everything all right?

320
00:16:12,668 --> 00:16:14,043
Yeah, I'm fine

321
00:16:18,799 --> 00:16:20,883
Just take the
casserole out of the

322
00:16:20,968 --> 00:16:22,010
Loser

323
00:16:22,094 --> 00:16:24,345
Take it out of the refrigerator,
put it in the oven

324
00:16:24,430 --> 00:16:27,098
It'll be fine Just leave
it in for 20 minutes

325
00:16:27,808 --> 00:16:29,350
Loser

326
00:16:29,435 --> 00:16:30,727
When I was a salesman
I could just be like,

327
00:16:30,811 --> 00:16:34,689
"Not my job, not my prob I'm going
to the warehouse to polish my knob."

328
00:16:35,482 --> 00:16:37,108
Metaphorically, of course

329
00:16:37,818 --> 00:16:41,279
But now,
it is my job and my prob

330
00:16:42,114 --> 00:16:43,114
Hi, Robert

331
00:16:44,575 --> 00:16:46,951
Can you come out here, please?
It's really important.

332
00:16:51,832 --> 00:16:53,374
Clarify something

333
00:16:54,293 --> 00:16:57,754
Some people here
are under the misconception

334
00:16:58,297 --> 00:17:02,216
that some people
may be considered

335
00:17:02,801 --> 00:17:04,343
let's say top tier

336
00:17:04,428 --> 00:17:07,180
and others would
be second tier.

337
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,391
Thank you. Great

338
00:17:10,476 --> 00:17:13,144
I said winners and losers Is
that what you're talking about?

339
00:17:13,228 --> 00:17:17,899
Oh, that might That actually
might be what I'm thinking of.

340
00:17:18,442 --> 00:17:19,650
Can you clarify that?

341
00:17:19,735 --> 00:17:22,153
Let me tell you some
things I find productive

342
00:17:24,573 --> 00:17:25,990
Positive reinforcement

343
00:17:26,825 --> 00:17:28,326
negative reinforcement

344
00:17:28,827 --> 00:17:29,952
Honesty

345
00:17:30,329 --> 00:17:32,914
I'll tell you some things
I find unproductive

346
00:17:33,332 --> 00:17:36,375
Constantly worrying
about where you stand

347
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:38,586
based on
inscrutable social clues

348
00:17:38,670 --> 00:17:42,215
and then inevitably reframing
it a in a reassuring way

349
00:17:42,299 --> 00:17:43,758
so that you can get
to sleep at night.

350
00:17:44,176 --> 00:17:46,636
No, I do not
believe in that at all

351
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:49,680
If I invited you to lunch
I think you're a winner

352
00:17:50,099 --> 00:17:51,140
If I didn't, I don't

353
00:17:51,225 --> 00:17:52,975
But I just met you all

354
00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:55,436
Life is long,
opinions change

355
00:17:55,521 --> 00:17:59,816
Winners, prove me right
Losers, prove me wrong

356
00:18:07,407 --> 00:18:09,492
Well, I guess
that's that

357
00:18:09,576 --> 00:18:10,576
No

358
00:18:12,830 --> 00:18:14,580
No. No

359
00:18:17,334 --> 00:18:18,292
Andy, don't go in there

360
00:18:18,377 --> 00:18:19,919
I'm going in there

361
00:18:25,342 --> 00:18:29,178
I know that every time I talk to
you things just seem to get worse

362
00:18:29,888 --> 00:18:32,807
But you don't know
these people, and I do

363
00:18:32,891 --> 00:18:35,560
And if I let you work
with faulty information

364
00:18:35,727 --> 00:18:38,062
well then I'm not doing my
job as regional manager.

365
00:18:38,939 --> 00:18:43,067
So, please take this pen
and change your list.

366
00:18:43,152 --> 00:18:45,027
I'm not going to
change my list, Andy

367
00:18:45,112 --> 00:18:46,988
And I don't use
ballpoint pens.

368
00:18:48,907 --> 00:18:51,576
Well, then I w
make a new list for you

369
00:18:57,082 --> 00:18:59,834
Stanley, you may think
he's a lazy grump

370
00:18:59,918 --> 00:19:02,753
but did you know that he has the
most consistently high sales numbers

371
00:19:02,838 --> 00:19:04,172
of anyone in this office?

372
00:19:04,923 --> 00:19:06,174
And you may think
he's hard to love

373
00:19:06,258 --> 00:19:07,842
but did you know
that he's in not one

374
00:19:07,926 --> 00:19:10,094
but two long-term
romantic relationships?

375
00:19:11,138 --> 00:19:13,431
About the sales figures

376
00:19:13,515 --> 00:19:15,725
Meredith Palmer,
supplier relations

377
00:19:15,809 --> 00:19:18,853
The word "no,"
not even in her vocabulary

378
00:19:18,937 --> 00:19:20,229
And just to show you
that I'm being fair,

379
00:19:20,314 --> 00:19:21,522
you had Gabe in
the loser column

380
00:19:25,068 --> 00:19:26,444
Good call

381
00:19:27,029 --> 00:19:28,029
Pam

382
00:19:28,739 --> 00:19:33,951
easily the most creative and kind
person I have ever worked with.

383
00:19:34,036 --> 00:19:36,037
Jim, shut the door
This is just gross.

384
00:19:36,121 --> 00:19:37,121
Shh

385
00:19:37,206 --> 00:19:40,625
Erin Hannon, the receptionist
and my closest confidant

386
00:19:40,918 --> 00:19:42,710
A winner if
there ever was one

387
00:19:48,884 --> 00:19:49,926
Are we done?

388
00:19:50,010 --> 00:19:51,010
Yes

389
00:19:51,094 --> 00:19:52,261
No

390
00:19:52,638 --> 00:19:54,096
The Friday
before Columbus Day

391
00:19:54,181 --> 00:19:55,640
we're going to
take a half-day

392
00:19:55,724 --> 00:19:57,642
So that everyone can get a
jump on the long weekend.

393
00:19:57,726 --> 00:20:00,645
You want a three-and-a-half
day weekend for Columbus Day?

394
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:02,772
Yes, I do

395
00:20:02,856 --> 00:20:05,900
And you are aware that
Columbus and his legions

396
00:20:05,984 --> 00:20:09,654
committed genocide against an entire
civilization of Native Americans?

397
00:20:22,709 --> 00:20:23,834
Hey, guys

398
00:20:24,836 --> 00:20:28,089
so Columbus Day, we got
that half-day on Friday

399
00:20:28,173 --> 00:20:29,882
We get that every year

400
00:20:30,926 --> 00:20:32,343
Well, you got it
this year, too.

401
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:36,472
Good night, Andy
Good night.

402
00:20:36,807 --> 00:20:37,807
Bye

403
00:20:39,184 --> 00:20:40,810
Good night, Andy

404
00:20:44,648 --> 00:20:45,648
Good night

405
00:20:45,732 --> 00:20:46,816
Night

406
00:20:58,203 --> 00:21:00,496
All right, I'm going
to go warm up the car

407
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:01,998
Okay
Okay.

408
00:21:03,792 --> 00:21:05,876
You dropped something. Jim?

409
00:21:06,878 --> 00:21:09,755
Okay, I know I've been
crying easily today, but

410
00:21:12,884 --> 00:21:14,969
I mean, that's just
pretty killer, right?

411
00:21:17,597 --> 00:21:19,140
I mean,
maybe it's stupid

412
00:21:20,309 --> 00:21:21,434
No

413
00:21:23,103 --> 00:21:24,770
It's wonderful

414
00:21:24,855 --> 00:21:26,605
I'm going to frame it
