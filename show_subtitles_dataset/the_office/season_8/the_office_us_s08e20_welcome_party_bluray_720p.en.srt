1
00:00:01,438 --> 00:00:04,064
Hey, Jim Stanley's back
from the hospital today.

2
00:00:04,149 --> 00:00:05,566
Can you sign his card?
Oh, great

3
00:00:07,610 --> 00:00:10,779
"Glad they didn't mix up your
tonsillectomy with a mustachectomy."

4
00:00:12,699 --> 00:00:13,699
That's not good

5
00:00:13,908 --> 00:00:16,076
Oh, because your jokes
are all hilarious

6
00:00:16,161 --> 00:00:17,453
It's nice.
It's funny

7
00:00:17,537 --> 00:00:18,954
It mentions his
tonsillectomy and makes

8
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:20,456
a funny little joke
about his mustache

9
00:00:20,915 --> 00:00:22,124
Stanley doesn't
have a mustache

10
00:00:24,419 --> 00:00:25,461
Yeah, he does

11
00:00:25,545 --> 00:00:28,839
Pam, hit the brakes Stanley
does not have a mustache.

12
00:00:30,008 --> 00:00:35,471
I think he has a mustache

13
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:37,556
Okay, Phyllis sits
across from him every day

14
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:38,974
Phyllis, does he
have a mustache or not?

15
00:00:39,059 --> 00:00:41,643
Oh, I don't know.
Now I think he doesn't

16
00:00:42,187 --> 00:00:43,771
Phyllis,
what are you talking

17
00:00:43,855 --> 00:00:45,814
The whole card
depends on this

18
00:00:45,899 --> 00:00:47,524
Okay, the man's
worked here for 25 years

19
00:00:47,609 --> 00:00:49,318
How can none of us
picture his face?

20
00:00:49,402 --> 00:00:50,903
Because we come
here to do our jobs

21
00:00:50,987 --> 00:00:53,155
We don't stick our noses
in other people's business

22
00:00:53,531 --> 00:00:56,408
Okay. Which one of these
looks more right?

23
00:00:56,493 --> 00:00:57,785
Neither of those
looks like any person

24
00:00:57,869 --> 00:00:59,411
that has ever
existed or been dreamt of

25
00:00:59,496 --> 00:01:01,038
in the history
of human insanity

26
00:01:01,122 --> 00:01:02,623
That said
the one on the left

27
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:06,752
Guys, that's the elevator
What if it's him?

28
00:01:06,836 --> 00:01:09,004
Okay, quick,
who says "mustache"?

29
00:01:10,131 --> 00:01:11,131
Yep

30
00:01:11,674 --> 00:01:13,175
Who says "no mustache"?

31
00:01:20,767 --> 00:01:21,767
Ah!

32
00:01:21,976 --> 00:01:24,019
Hey!
He does have one

33
00:01:24,104 --> 00:01:25,104
Yes

34
00:01:26,689 --> 00:01:28,065
Welcome back, Stanley.

35
00:01:39,077 --> 00:01:40,536
"Good morning, Robert, '
says no one

36
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:43,080
because our receptionist
is in Florida.

37
00:01:50,588 --> 00:01:51,630
Pam
Oh

38
00:01:52,423 --> 00:01:56,969
Is this a video conference you're having
with "Drake featuring Swizz Beatz"?

39
00:01:57,512 --> 00:01:59,721
Um, no, I was just
having a cup of coffee

40
00:01:59,806 --> 00:02:01,014
kind of warming up
for the day.

41
00:02:01,307 --> 00:02:03,851
People, you should come
to work already warm

42
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:08,689
9:00 to 10:00 a.m. is the most productive
potential that human beings...

43
00:02:08,773 --> 00:02:10,983
Sorry! Sorry, everyone I'm late

44
00:02:11,067 --> 00:02:14,820
but you are all here, so no
harm done at a by my lateness

45
00:02:15,155 --> 00:02:17,072
Nellie, really, 9:50

46
00:02:17,323 --> 00:02:19,324
Oh, here's
what happened.

47
00:02:19,409 --> 00:02:23,662
7:46, my alarm clock goes off,
I hear it, whack the snooze.

48
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:28,167
Nine minutes. Buzz,
off it goes again, whack

49
00:02:28,251 --> 00:02:32,629
Seven more times I did that
Buzz, whack, buzz, whack.

50
00:02:33,464 --> 00:02:35,632
By the time I got up,
it was 10 minutes ago

51
00:02:35,717 --> 00:02:38,260
No will power
That is my curse

52
00:02:38,511 --> 00:02:41,513
I've never believed will power
was very important in a woman

53
00:02:44,225 --> 00:02:46,560
would have shown up
to work

54
00:02:46,644 --> 00:02:48,770
nearly an hour late
for no reason.

55
00:02:49,063 --> 00:02:50,647
Oh, I assure you
I would have done

56
00:02:50,732 --> 00:02:52,941
I did And I'll keep doing it

57
00:02:53,276 --> 00:02:56,320
No, no, there's something going
on some stress in your life.

58
00:02:56,779 --> 00:03:02,492
Well, yes, there is the whole
moving to Scranton nonsense

59
00:03:02,785 --> 00:03:07,497
Thirty boxes arrived yesterday from
England and two trunks from Florida.

60
00:03:07,624 --> 00:03:09,708
Then, I have to
move into my apartment

61
00:03:09,792 --> 00:03:12,961
in this dreadful,
God knows where it is

62
00:03:13,129 --> 00:03:15,088
backwater,
suburb of a suburb

63
00:03:15,506 --> 00:03:16,757
and I mean no offense,
but are there

64
00:03:16,841 --> 00:03:19,218
a lot of Irish people
living around here?

65
00:03:19,469 --> 00:03:20,802
Yes
- Oh

66
00:03:21,221 --> 00:03:23,263
No offense

67
00:03:23,514 --> 00:03:24,556
None taken

68
00:03:24,641 --> 00:03:27,309
Actually, Nellie, this monologue
you're delivering is very offensive.

69
00:03:27,852 --> 00:03:30,979
Ooh! Ay caramba! The natives
are getting restless.

70
00:03:31,314 --> 00:03:32,606
Who's a native?

71
00:03:33,107 --> 00:03:35,484
Excuse me, the tone here
is getting quite hostile

72
00:03:35,693 --> 00:03:37,569
I would appreciate it if
you would keep that stuff

73
00:03:37,654 --> 00:03:39,154
on the basketball court

74
00:03:39,489 --> 00:03:40,989
What does that mean?
Okay, okay

75
00:03:41,074 --> 00:03:43,867
If you'd let me finish

76
00:03:43,952 --> 00:03:48,372
Or the squash court or
the supreme court Hmm?

77
00:03:49,624 --> 00:03:51,500
Nellie?
Yes, Robert

78
00:03:52,335 --> 00:03:56,380
You're clearly under a lot
of stress with the moving

79
00:03:56,464 --> 00:04:00,175
and the work situation
you've found yourself in

80
00:04:00,301 --> 00:04:01,301
Yeah

81
00:04:01,386 --> 00:04:02,970
Let's help her out
shall we?

82
00:04:03,179 --> 00:04:05,764
Go above and beyond today

83
00:04:05,848 --> 00:04:09,309
to show her some of that
warm Scranton hospitality

84
00:04:10,812 --> 00:04:13,188
Jim, Dwight, take the day

85
00:04:13,273 --> 00:04:17,025
Help Nellie move those
boxes into her new place

86
00:04:17,527 --> 00:04:18,527
Why Jim?
What?

87
00:04:18,736 --> 00:04:22,447
The rest of you, let's throw a
party at the end of the day

88
00:04:22,532 --> 00:04:25,450
to welcome the newest member
of our little community.

89
00:04:26,619 --> 00:04:28,745
I'm sorry, we're throwing
a party for someone

90
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:30,205
because they're
being horrible?

91
00:04:30,290 --> 00:04:32,165
I'm sorry.
We're taking work time

92
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:34,459
to move someone's personal
belongings into their new apartment

93
00:04:34,585 --> 00:04:36,336
I'm still not sure why
this woman is even here!

94
00:04:36,462 --> 00:04:37,713
Why is she here?

95
00:04:38,548 --> 00:04:42,050
Two crazy kids on
the journey of life

96
00:04:42,135 --> 00:04:45,095
Going to Pennsylvania

97
00:04:45,263 --> 00:04:47,681
On the road with
my new girlfriend

98
00:04:48,391 --> 00:04:52,144
But first, a small pit stop to break
up with my current girlfriend,

99
00:04:52,228 --> 00:04:55,314
who is at her parents' cabin
in southern Pennsylvania

100
00:04:55,398 --> 00:04:56,648
Oh, that must be nice

101
00:04:56,733 --> 00:04:57,816
Mmm-hmm

102
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:01,570
It's a beautiful place Great
place to let her down easy.

103
00:05:01,654 --> 00:05:04,406
Oh, no, no I meant that must
be nice to have parents.

104
00:05:04,490 --> 00:05:05,574
Oh. Hmm

105
00:05:06,826 --> 00:05:09,453
Time to have a little kiss

106
00:05:09,537 --> 00:05:10,662
No

107
00:05:10,747 --> 00:05:12,331
Mmm. Sorry, right

108
00:05:12,457 --> 00:05:14,041
No kisses until the
breakup is official Yes

109
00:05:14,125 --> 00:05:15,334
I believe in that
Yes, so do I

110
00:05:15,418 --> 00:05:18,587
I think that's important. That is
important. Bummer, but important

111
00:05:18,713 --> 00:05:20,088
Important.
Mmm-hmm

112
00:05:20,506 --> 00:05:22,841
I can't believe he's making
us throw a party for her

113
00:05:24,093 --> 00:05:25,427
She's always late
she's always rude

114
00:05:25,678 --> 00:05:27,637
It kind of makes me want to
throw a really bad party.

115
00:05:27,722 --> 00:05:28,722
Yeah

116
00:05:28,848 --> 00:05:29,890
On purpose

117
00:05:30,725 --> 00:05:31,892
Phyllis

118
00:05:33,519 --> 00:05:35,228
We should do it right
here in the break room

119
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,646
Ooh

120
00:05:37,231 --> 00:05:38,523
Order carrot cake

121
00:05:42,195 --> 00:05:43,403
And Jessica
just so you know

122
00:05:43,488 --> 00:05:46,990
this is way more about my love for
Erin than anything wrong with you

123
00:05:47,075 --> 00:05:51,078
Well, Andy, I'm upset, but you did
this in the best way possible

124
00:05:51,162 --> 00:05:56,500
and I knew you as a lover and
I'll remember you as a gentleman.

125
00:05:56,584 --> 00:05:58,919
Okay. That was one
minute and 10 seconds

126
00:05:59,003 --> 00:06:00,629
Consider it nailed

127
00:06:02,465 --> 00:06:03,757
should try it again

128
00:06:03,841 --> 00:06:05,342
This time
worst case scenario

129
00:06:05,593 --> 00:06:09,262
Okay, here we go. Jessica, I'm really
sorry. I just need you to know

130
00:06:09,347 --> 00:06:10,972
What?

131
00:06:11,474 --> 00:06:12,724
I just need
you to know

132
00:06:12,809 --> 00:06:14,810
What? I didn't
sleep well last night

133
00:06:20,817 --> 00:06:21,942
Ow

134
00:06:22,443 --> 00:06:24,653
Nellie, that reminds me do you
want this chair in the bedroom?

135
00:06:24,737 --> 00:06:26,321
'Cause I don't think it's
going to fit through the door

136
00:06:26,489 --> 00:06:28,990
Don't listen to Jim. Have you
ever seen him play Tetris?

137
00:06:29,075 --> 00:06:31,743
"Oh, I think I'll just
use this line horizontally

138
00:06:31,828 --> 00:06:34,454
"Oh, I have no idea
what a gift this line is.'

139
00:06:34,539 --> 00:06:35,622
That was one time

140
00:06:35,706 --> 00:06:38,834
I will get the chair in. Watch the
great "Schrut-ini" work his magic

141
00:06:39,085 --> 00:06:42,587
Oh, no, really? Magic, no,
no, no let's not go there

142
00:06:43,172 --> 00:06:46,967
No, nothing is more
repellent than magicians

143
00:06:47,051 --> 00:06:49,386
Bunch of grown men
waving wands

144
00:06:49,470 --> 00:06:51,471
pulling bunnies
out of body crevices

145
00:06:51,681 --> 00:06:53,765
Magicians are repulsive
Next topic

146
00:06:54,934 --> 00:06:56,017
Excuse me, one second

147
00:06:57,812 --> 00:06:59,771
Hi
- Hey, what's up?

148
00:06:59,856 --> 00:07:02,107
Oh, nothing, just hauling
some cube with Dwight.

149
00:07:02,191 --> 00:07:03,692
Hauling cube

150
00:07:03,776 --> 00:07:04,860
That's moving boxes

151
00:07:04,944 --> 00:07:06,903
We just came up with the
term to make it sound cooler

152
00:07:06,988 --> 00:07:08,697
So, we're planning
this party for Nellie,

153
00:07:08,781 --> 00:07:11,408
and we're going to
make it really bad.

154
00:07:11,492 --> 00:07:12,534
It sounds like
every other party

155
00:07:12,910 --> 00:07:14,786
No, we're going to
make it like a prank

156
00:07:14,871 --> 00:07:17,873
like order bad food, give her
this passive-aggressive card

157
00:07:18,082 --> 00:07:19,958
Oh, hire a magician

158
00:07:20,042 --> 00:07:21,126
What?

159
00:07:21,210 --> 00:07:23,170
Trust me
Okay.

160
00:07:30,970 --> 00:07:34,347
Wow, there's a lot of cars
here This is just weird.

161
00:07:36,267 --> 00:07:39,728
Andy. Hi, what are
you doing here?

162
00:07:39,896 --> 00:07:41,480
Hey, Lauren
look at you.

163
00:07:43,608 --> 00:07:45,233
I'm just on my way back
from this business trip

164
00:07:45,318 --> 00:07:46,902
thought I'd stop
and say hi to Jessica

165
00:07:47,069 --> 00:07:48,069
Aw

166
00:07:48,362 --> 00:07:50,822
Why is Erin with me?
That's a great question

167
00:07:50,907 --> 00:07:55,577
She is my co-worker and she needed
a ride because she totaled her car

168
00:07:55,828 --> 00:07:57,162
Oh, God

169
00:07:57,663 --> 00:07:59,539
So I'm Erin
Yeah, this is Erin

170
00:07:59,624 --> 00:08:00,874
Hi. Nice to meet you

171
00:08:02,210 --> 00:08:06,463
Well, Jess went out for a run
but she'll be back soon

172
00:08:06,547 --> 00:08:07,547
Mmm-hmm

173
00:08:07,632 --> 00:08:09,925
Hey, ladies,
Andy's here

174
00:08:10,968 --> 00:08:14,221
Okay, Andy, that is
a bachelorette party

175
00:08:14,305 --> 00:08:17,849
This is Jessica's friends and they've
been drinking during the daytime

176
00:08:17,934 --> 00:08:18,934
Should we go?

177
00:08:19,018 --> 00:08:20,060
Yeah

178
00:08:20,603 --> 00:08:22,562
You know, we had such a quick
window to make this work.

179
00:08:22,647 --> 00:08:23,688
I think we should
probably just

180
00:08:23,773 --> 00:08:27,859
Oh, Jess look who stopped
by after his business trip

181
00:08:27,944 --> 00:08:29,486
Andy, hey

182
00:08:31,447 --> 00:08:34,991
are called
presidential-sized in England

183
00:08:36,327 --> 00:08:37,661
a "Tweeter" account

184
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,871
Yes, you should

185
00:08:41,791 --> 00:08:42,791
Ooh

186
00:08:46,629 --> 00:08:47,796
I have to see
these shoes.

187
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:51,550
Oh

188
00:08:53,302 --> 00:08:54,761
Who is this guy?

189
00:08:56,180 --> 00:08:58,056
There's the two of them
taking a hike

190
00:08:58,140 --> 00:08:59,933
I'm guessing he's
some kind of friend

191
00:09:00,476 --> 00:09:01,685
Boyfriend

192
00:09:01,894 --> 00:09:03,728
Here's the two of them
kissing at a beach

193
00:09:03,813 --> 00:09:06,189
and kissing at
the Eiffel Tower

194
00:09:06,274 --> 00:09:08,650
I'm guessing he's some kind
of close romantic friend

195
00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:10,110
Like a boyfriend?

196
00:09:10,528 --> 00:09:12,571
You read my mind.
Yeah

197
00:09:13,239 --> 00:09:15,949
Whoa. Here's one with
his face whited out.

198
00:09:16,033 --> 00:09:17,075
Hmm

199
00:09:17,159 --> 00:09:18,285
Maybe someone threw
a pie in his face.

200
00:09:18,619 --> 00:09:20,620
New theory, he's a hated
Italian politician

201
00:09:20,830 --> 00:09:22,289
Better theory,
this is her ex-boyfriend

202
00:09:22,373 --> 00:09:23,873
and they went through some
kind of painful breakup

203
00:09:25,084 --> 00:09:26,084
Oh
- Nellie

204
00:09:26,877 --> 00:09:28,753
so sorry,
we were just

205
00:09:29,338 --> 00:09:31,339
discovered Benjamin

206
00:09:31,424 --> 00:09:33,425
That's what I call my box
full of photos of Henry

207
00:09:34,969 --> 00:09:36,511
Why not call...
Shh

208
00:09:38,764 --> 00:09:42,434
God, we owned
this flat together

209
00:09:42,518 --> 00:09:45,186
Then one morning just
like that, he was gone

210
00:09:45,271 --> 00:09:47,105
He ran off with a waitress
at our favorite restaurant.

211
00:09:47,690 --> 00:09:49,316
That's awful

212
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:51,943
What kind of restaurant?

213
00:09:52,028 --> 00:09:53,028
Dwight

214
00:09:53,237 --> 00:09:56,531
afford the flat myself
So I sold it at a loss

215
00:09:57,033 --> 00:09:59,284
Ah, but what's 10 years
of bliss down the drain

216
00:09:59,368 --> 00:10:03,038
compared with the thrill of starting
over with nothing and no one?

217
00:10:03,497 --> 00:10:06,374
I'm so sorry These must
be very painful memories

218
00:10:06,459 --> 00:10:08,293
If it would
help you to forget

219
00:10:08,377 --> 00:10:11,087
in the brain stem
with this candlestick

220
00:10:12,214 --> 00:10:14,382
Thank you. No

221
00:10:16,636 --> 00:10:20,805
Look, Jim, Dwight, please,
don't tell anyone about this

222
00:10:20,973 --> 00:10:22,223
No, no, of course

223
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:28,730
Just one quick question
was this Halloween or

224
00:10:28,814 --> 00:10:30,732
God, no

225
00:10:30,816 --> 00:10:33,109
That's the most embarrassing
thing of all of this.

226
00:10:33,444 --> 00:10:36,696
What kind of fool gets her heart
broken by a bloody stage magician?

227
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:42,243
You know what, Pam? I was thinking
maybe we should change course here

228
00:10:42,328 --> 00:10:43,411
Let's give up on
all this mean stuff

229
00:10:43,704 --> 00:10:46,665
What? No. No. I just
had this brilliant idea

230
00:10:46,749 --> 00:10:47,874
Everyone loved it.

231
00:10:47,958 --> 00:10:50,001
You don't have
a copyright on pranks

232
00:10:50,086 --> 00:10:52,128
at this than you

233
00:10:52,421 --> 00:10:54,422
No, that's not Jim, could
you give us a hand?

234
00:10:54,507 --> 00:10:55,715
Absolutely. Yeah

235
00:10:55,841 --> 00:10:57,884
Call it off, Pam.
Call it off, okay?

236
00:10:57,968 --> 00:10:59,135
It's way more complicated
than you think.

237
00:10:59,303 --> 00:11:00,804
Cancel the magician.
Trust me.

238
00:11:00,888 --> 00:11:03,848
Oh, okay.
Okay, I will

239
00:11:06,602 --> 00:11:07,727
That's a great idea

240
00:11:07,812 --> 00:11:09,312
Yeah. Okay

241
00:11:09,438 --> 00:11:10,605
Pam, we have a great idea.
- Listen to this

242
00:11:10,690 --> 00:11:12,607
We're going to have the
fluorescent lights flickering.

243
00:11:12,692 --> 00:11:13,983
It's going to
make everyone sick

244
00:11:14,819 --> 00:11:16,236
Or what if
Okay.

245
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:22,283
we discuss the idea of doing
the party totally normal

246
00:11:22,952 --> 00:11:24,619
Like, not mean

247
00:11:25,287 --> 00:11:26,788
Just a regular party

248
00:11:27,873 --> 00:11:28,915
Not mean

249
00:11:28,999 --> 00:11:31,668
I knew she'd crack I wanted
to leave you out, you know.

250
00:11:31,836 --> 00:11:34,421
We're in far too deep We can't
change course at this point

251
00:11:34,505 --> 00:11:36,965
What are you talking about?
Of course we can

252
00:11:37,049 --> 00:11:38,174
What I mean to say is
we don't want to.

253
00:11:38,467 --> 00:11:40,885
Toots, we're not stopping this
train, so get off the tracks

254
00:11:42,555 --> 00:11:43,555
Suck it

255
00:11:45,558 --> 00:11:46,558
Andy

256
00:11:47,059 --> 00:11:50,395
It'll be fine. Just act natural.
Do you want a gummy penis?

257
00:11:50,813 --> 00:11:52,814
No. I'll just have
some gummy bears

258
00:11:53,023 --> 00:11:54,065
These are delicious

259
00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:55,400
But they're penises

260
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:57,861
And we come to Matthew

261
00:11:57,945 --> 00:11:59,612
the guy who was
with his old girlfriend

262
00:11:59,697 --> 00:12:01,573
basically the whole time
we were together

263
00:12:01,657 --> 00:12:03,032
Oh, no

264
00:12:03,743 --> 00:12:07,495
Eww! That seems gross
at first blush, right?

265
00:12:07,788 --> 00:12:10,999
But relationships are always
more complicated than you think.

266
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:13,877
Know Matthew's history
with this other woman

267
00:12:14,837 --> 00:12:17,964
Maybe she saved his life
I don't know

268
00:12:19,675 --> 00:12:20,884
rush to judgment
about Matthew

269
00:12:20,968 --> 00:12:22,177
Maybe we don't
pop that one.

270
00:12:22,386 --> 00:12:24,095
No. Pop it
Pop it

271
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:25,221
Pop it

272
00:12:27,808 --> 00:12:29,058
Hey
Hey

273
00:12:29,143 --> 00:12:30,643
Sorry It's kind of a mad house

274
00:12:33,063 --> 00:12:34,397
Oh, Megan

275
00:12:34,732 --> 00:12:37,275
You are one of the good
ones, Nard Dog. Aw

276
00:12:37,359 --> 00:12:39,194
No, really.
Where's my Andy?

277
00:12:39,987 --> 00:12:41,404
He's out there

278
00:12:42,239 --> 00:12:43,448
Are you going to
sing for us?

279
00:12:43,866 --> 00:12:46,993
Well, you guys are doing a pretty
good job with the scary yelling, so

280
00:12:47,077 --> 00:12:51,122
That's not like you That's not
like you Come on, sing! Sing

281
00:12:51,207 --> 00:12:57,378
By yon bonnie banks
and by yon bonnie braes

282
00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:00,006
Okay, they're almost here
What?

283
00:13:01,175 --> 00:13:03,384
Come on! If you guys
are going to be mean

284
00:13:03,469 --> 00:13:04,761
can't you at least
be subtle?

285
00:13:05,721 --> 00:13:08,598
Oh, in the warehouse
we'd use code names

286
00:13:08,682 --> 00:13:10,266
for people we
wanted to talk about

287
00:13:10,351 --> 00:13:13,061
Andy was "Jelly Roll.' Mike
was "Dennis the Menace.<'

288
00:13:13,687 --> 00:13:14,687
Ryan was "Douche Bag.'

289
00:13:15,022 --> 00:13:17,774
Hey, that's not a code name
That's just an insult

290
00:13:17,858 --> 00:13:19,651
Plus, everyone would
know who you meant Yeah.

291
00:13:19,735 --> 00:13:22,320
No, that's a great idea.
Yes, let's have a code name

292
00:13:22,404 --> 00:13:26,115
How about "Mondays"? I hate Mondays.
Mondays are the worst

293
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,200
Nobody's named Monday

294
00:13:27,409 --> 00:13:30,453
Hey, how about we go with "Pam"?
Simple, easy to remember

295
00:13:30,913 --> 00:13:33,164
Because there's someone
already here named Pam

296
00:13:33,249 --> 00:13:34,249
Shh. Here she comes

297
00:13:34,333 --> 00:13:35,333
Hey

298
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:37,252
Welcome to your party

299
00:13:37,586 --> 00:13:41,339
Everybody, get comry now This first
song's over a half-hour long.

300
00:13:47,429 --> 00:13:51,015
Best gig ever. They asked
me to play only originals

301
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:53,852
I said, "Have you heard my originals?
They're terrible."

302
00:13:53,936 --> 00:13:59,107
They said, "Even better." I said, "I get
it. It's an ironic party for Nellie.'

303
00:13:59,942 --> 00:14:01,276
Maybe we should just go

304
00:14:01,402 --> 00:14:02,735
No, I got to do this

305
00:14:04,613 --> 00:14:06,239
Hey, Jessica
can I talk to you?

306
00:14:06,365 --> 00:14:07,991
Uh, yeah, sure
what's up?

307
00:14:08,075 --> 00:14:09,576
Maybe we could
talk in private

308
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:11,494
Yeah, what is it?

309
00:14:12,413 --> 00:14:14,247
Well, first,
let me just say that

310
00:14:14,331 --> 00:14:17,917
done with the
sort of ugly bits

311
00:14:18,002 --> 00:14:19,794
that we can
stay friends

312
00:14:19,879 --> 00:14:21,045
You're breaking up
with me?

313
00:14:21,463 --> 00:14:22,547
Uh

314
00:14:22,631 --> 00:14:24,299
No. No

315
00:14:24,967 --> 00:14:27,886
You always do this.
You twist my words around

316
00:14:27,970 --> 00:14:29,971
Part of me thinks we should
just end this right now

317
00:14:30,389 --> 00:14:34,392
Oh, my God Are you
leaving me for Erin?

318
00:14:34,476 --> 00:14:37,395
You said she wasn't relationship
material, and she wasn't as good as me

319
00:14:37,479 --> 00:14:38,730
But it's her, isn't it?

320
00:14:38,814 --> 00:14:39,814
Whoa

321
00:14:40,733 --> 00:14:44,193
That... No
Okay, you want honesty?

322
00:14:44,403 --> 00:14:47,947
Super honesty time
I'm gay.

323
00:14:48,574 --> 00:14:49,574
What?

324
00:14:54,288 --> 00:14:55,496
You did not, Kenny

325
00:14:55,623 --> 00:14:57,290
You invited me to
go shopping with you

326
00:14:57,374 --> 00:15:01,669
I like hanging out with you
You're a cool guy.

327
00:15:01,754 --> 00:15:03,796
Which proves my point
that I'm gay.

328
00:15:04,006 --> 00:15:06,007
JESSICA
Andy, you're not gay

329
00:15:06,091 --> 00:15:11,304
and you seemed
pretty excitable.

330
00:15:11,388 --> 00:15:15,516
Well, I was faking it.
I had to fake it every time

331
00:15:15,601 --> 00:15:18,686
with John Stamos

332
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:22,857
doesn't make sense

333
00:15:23,776 --> 00:15:26,402
Well, I mean I was
good at hiding it...

334
00:15:26,487 --> 00:15:28,321
It's fine, Andy

335
00:15:29,031 --> 00:15:31,616
we were going to get
married or anything.

336
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:34,827
I'm just upset for now

337
00:15:35,204 --> 00:15:40,208
Understandable, and I'm
really sorry I really am.

338
00:15:44,046 --> 00:15:47,799
So, we should probably go

339
00:15:55,891 --> 00:15:59,143
This humble
but sincere effort is

340
00:15:59,228 --> 00:16:02,063
all for our valued new colleague.
Excellent.

341
00:16:02,773 --> 00:16:05,400
To Nellie Bertram,
you are a most welcome

342
00:16:05,484 --> 00:16:07,402
and friendly presence
at our company

343
00:16:07,736 --> 00:16:09,237
Cheers
Why, thank you.

344
00:16:10,114 --> 00:16:13,366
Pam, on the other hand
is a most unwelcome

345
00:16:13,492 --> 00:16:17,078
entitled and unfriendly
presence in our company

346
00:16:17,204 --> 00:16:18,579
Cheers

347
00:16:20,457 --> 00:16:24,043
Nellie is terrific
but to be honest

348
00:16:24,128 --> 00:16:27,338
every day, I imagine how happy I'd be
if Pam died.

349
00:16:29,341 --> 00:16:35,179
Oh, well, I feel that as
someone who knows Pam

350
00:16:35,264 --> 00:16:40,143
only a little bit enough, a good
amount not the most, though,

351
00:16:40,269 --> 00:16:42,145
she is misunderstood

352
00:16:42,688 --> 00:16:45,148
and that maybe there's
some stuff in her past

353
00:16:45,232 --> 00:16:46,983
that you guys
don't know about

354
00:16:47,067 --> 00:16:48,526
that's a little
messed up and probably

355
00:16:48,610 --> 00:16:50,236
makes her such a
torture to work with.

356
00:16:50,612 --> 00:16:56,075
ALL We hate Pam! We hate Pam We hate Pam!
We hate Pam

357
00:16:56,410 --> 00:16:57,660
So we've established

358
00:16:57,745 --> 00:16:58,703
No

359
00:16:58,787 --> 00:17:00,788
that you guys hate Pam

360
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:04,959
Do you ever wish she
would just disappear?

361
00:17:05,627 --> 00:17:06,627
Oh

362
00:17:10,466 --> 00:17:11,758
That was a really
rough scene

363
00:17:11,842 --> 00:17:13,634
Right? Rough scene
Yeah.

364
00:17:16,597 --> 00:17:18,014
At least we can kiss now

365
00:17:18,098 --> 00:17:19,474
Oh, yeah

366
00:17:24,229 --> 00:17:27,774
You know, that stuff that I said
about you to her, that's just...

367
00:17:30,027 --> 00:17:31,319
You know, I was dating
her at the time.

368
00:17:31,403 --> 00:17:32,445
Yeah

369
00:17:33,238 --> 00:17:34,947
Yes, of course

370
00:17:36,116 --> 00:17:37,116
Ugh

371
00:17:38,327 --> 00:17:39,368
Yeah

372
00:17:39,453 --> 00:17:40,495
Probably from
seeing that turkey

373
00:17:40,579 --> 00:17:41,579
Oh, yeah

374
00:17:41,663 --> 00:17:45,500
When we drove by the farm
Always does that.

375
00:17:52,424 --> 00:17:55,051
Are you Nellie? I think
you're my volunteer.

376
00:17:55,135 --> 00:17:56,260
Come on
over here, huh?

377
00:17:58,180 --> 00:17:59,972
No, I'll do it. I will volunteer

378
00:18:00,099 --> 00:18:01,808
No, Nellie should
No, I'll do it.

379
00:18:01,975 --> 00:18:08,272
Oh, big guy, huh? How's the air up there?
Watch out for birds

380
00:18:09,942 --> 00:18:13,444
All right, let's
do some card magic

381
00:18:13,529 --> 00:18:15,613
Now, what I want
you to do is,

382
00:18:15,697 --> 00:18:18,324
I want you to pick a card
just by looking at it.

383
00:18:18,450 --> 00:18:20,868
Do not say what it is

384
00:18:23,705 --> 00:18:24,705
It's the four of hearts

385
00:18:25,082 --> 00:18:26,582
Oh, no, it's

386
00:18:26,667 --> 00:18:30,128
Looks like we got a guy from
another country here, huh?

387
00:18:30,254 --> 00:18:33,464
No hablo el cardo, senor?

388
00:18:34,383 --> 00:18:38,928
All right, the card is picked Now,
sir, will you please shuffle the deck?

389
00:18:45,561 --> 00:18:47,895
You didn't just do that
on purpose, did you?

390
00:18:48,063 --> 00:18:50,940
Why is Jim treating
the magician poorly?

391
00:18:51,066 --> 00:18:53,776
Little known fact about me
before I was a magician

392
00:18:53,861 --> 00:18:56,821
at a rope factory

393
00:18:56,905 --> 00:18:59,073
Not true because
that's not a real place

394
00:18:59,741 --> 00:19:02,994
But I never could seem to
figure out those knots

395
00:19:03,078 --> 00:19:04,996
That's not a real knot When you
pull on it, it disappears.

396
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:06,080
What the hell?

397
00:19:07,249 --> 00:19:09,625
All right Where's Phyllis?
Who's Phyllis?

398
00:19:10,794 --> 00:19:15,840
Look, this is really uncool, okay?
I put on a clean show here

399
00:19:15,924 --> 00:19:17,925
Okay, scram, wizard
What?

400
00:19:18,010 --> 00:19:19,093
You heard me

401
00:19:19,261 --> 00:19:21,929
Wow. Nellie I'm sorry.
If I'd known

402
00:19:22,014 --> 00:19:24,682
Jim and Pam
would use this party

403
00:19:24,766 --> 00:19:26,893
as an excuse to
abuse a magician

404
00:19:27,019 --> 00:19:29,604
Well, I thought
it was quite fun

405
00:19:30,230 --> 00:19:32,982
In fact, I think they're brilliant
employees in their own way.

406
00:19:34,026 --> 00:19:35,359
Don't you see
what I see?

407
00:19:35,736 --> 00:19:38,738
Interesting, yes.
No, yes, I see that

408
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:43,159
Great work, team
Great party

409
00:19:43,577 --> 00:19:46,037
You think this
is a great party?

410
00:19:46,121 --> 00:19:50,583
This cake has vegetables in
it like a salad bar, Robert

411
00:19:50,667 --> 00:19:53,252
How do I get this
taste out of my mouth?

412
00:19:57,299 --> 00:19:58,799
What? Why are we

413
00:19:58,884 --> 00:20:00,343
one thing.

414
00:20:06,808 --> 00:20:08,017
Oh, hello

415
00:20:08,477 --> 00:20:10,228
Hey, everybody
look who's here

416
00:20:10,312 --> 00:20:11,354
What are you doing here?

417
00:20:11,688 --> 00:20:15,733
Hi. Super duper honesty
time, I'm not gay

418
00:20:16,485 --> 00:20:18,903
In fact I'm so not gay that
I'm in love with a girl

419
00:20:18,987 --> 00:20:22,114
Her name is Erin Hannon
and she is right there.

420
00:20:22,199 --> 00:20:25,076
She's sweet,
funny and beautiful

421
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:26,911
and total
relationship material

422
00:20:28,247 --> 00:20:29,538
Why the hell did
you come back here?

423
00:20:29,915 --> 00:20:30,957
Go away

424
00:20:31,041 --> 00:20:32,041
Get lost

425
00:20:32,167 --> 00:20:33,417
Get out
Okay.

426
00:20:33,502 --> 00:20:35,044
You're done! Get out
Bye, guys. Go. Go.

427
00:20:35,128 --> 00:20:36,170
You ruined my party

428
00:20:37,047 --> 00:20:39,590
Who does that?
Are you kidding me?

429
00:20:39,675 --> 00:20:41,133
Yeah, run away
Run away

430
00:20:41,218 --> 00:20:42,426
KENNY
You're disgusting

431
00:20:42,511 --> 00:20:44,387
I can't believe
you're not gay

432
00:20:45,722 --> 00:20:46,806
Yeah,
get out of here

433
00:20:46,890 --> 00:20:47,974
Don't come back

434
00:20:50,727 --> 00:20:51,936
Uh-oh.

435
00:20:52,479 --> 00:20:53,729
You don't even
know how to drive

436
00:20:54,356 --> 00:20:56,274
Loser! Nice car

437
00:21:03,031 --> 00:21:04,824
Hey, Hank
Yes, ma'am.

438
00:21:05,033 --> 00:21:08,869
I thought I was very specific about
you not letting up a magician

439
00:21:09,329 --> 00:21:10,997
Yes, ma'am
I got my eyes open

440
00:21:11,373 --> 00:21:13,374
Well, turns out he
actually made it up there.

441
00:21:13,667 --> 00:21:15,209
What? That ain't right

442
00:21:15,544 --> 00:21:16,752
Yeah, he came and went

443
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:22,049
Wait a minute, you said
it was a magician, right?

444
00:21:23,051 --> 00:21:25,761
You don't think he could have used...
It couldn't have been

445
00:21:27,556 --> 00:21:28,556
Let's just go

446
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:29,724
Good night, Hank
