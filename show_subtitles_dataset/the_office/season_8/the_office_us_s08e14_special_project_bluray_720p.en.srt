1
00:00:02,042 --> 00:00:03,042
Ho-ho

2
00:00:03,126 --> 00:00:05,294
Look who's back reporting
for duty Hey, guys

3
00:00:06,129 --> 00:00:07,296
Hey
Hi

4
00:00:07,547 --> 00:00:08,964
Pam! Ha

5
00:00:09,049 --> 00:00:10,924
Look what I can do now that
she's no longer pregnant

6
00:00:11,009 --> 00:00:12,384
Bam! Bam! Bam! Pam

7
00:00:12,761 --> 00:00:13,969
Are you glad
to be back?

8
00:00:14,304 --> 00:00:17,097
Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I could have
used another week, or three

9
00:00:17,182 --> 00:00:19,308
You still had eight
weeks more than we did.

10
00:00:19,476 --> 00:00:21,810
Well, it's not
exactly a vacation

11
00:00:21,895 --> 00:00:25,355
Hello, everyone! Remember?
Little old me. Hi

12
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:27,274
What are you doing here?
You just had our baby.

13
00:00:27,358 --> 00:00:32,654
Our collective Dunder Mifflin
family baby four days ago.

14
00:00:32,989 --> 00:00:34,239
I wanted to come
back to work.

15
00:00:34,324 --> 00:00:38,619
Not everybody needs some long,
luxurious, Parisian maternity leave

16
00:00:39,162 --> 00:00:41,038
Damn, girl! Your body!
What?

17
00:00:41,247 --> 00:00:42,915
Angela, you
look amazing

18
00:00:43,291 --> 00:00:46,543
Really? I feel like
this big rhinoceros

19
00:00:47,212 --> 00:00:50,506
Anyway, I wanted to thank you guys for
covering for me, so I made some treats

20
00:00:50,590 --> 00:00:52,424
I've got brownies
and magic cookie bars

21
00:00:52,509 --> 00:00:54,009
Mm-mm-mm

22
00:00:54,886 --> 00:00:58,722
Angela, those brownies have walnuts in them
and I think Kevin's allergic to walnuts.

23
00:00:58,807 --> 00:01:00,349
You're allergic to
walnuts right, Kevin?

24
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:02,684
Extremely, but I'm going
to fight through it

25
00:01:03,394 --> 00:01:05,729
It's okay, Angela. I have mommy brain, too

26
00:01:06,022 --> 00:01:07,481
what that is, Pam

27
00:01:07,565 --> 00:01:10,192
special for you,
Kevin. Right here.

28
00:01:10,735 --> 00:01:12,069
When did you find time
to do all this?

29
00:01:12,153 --> 00:01:14,363
Babies sleep a lot, Pam
if you feed them enough

30
00:01:15,406 --> 00:01:17,032
Brownie, Pam?

31
00:01:21,871 --> 00:01:23,247
Thank you

32
00:01:25,125 --> 00:01:27,209
Oh, my gosh
It's really good

33
00:01:27,544 --> 00:01:29,586
I'm watching my weight

34
00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:36,802
Say, guys, you know what's an even
more useful treat is cash. So

35
00:01:36,928 --> 00:01:39,721
Nope. It's over. No. Okay
We wanted to say thank you

36
00:01:49,274 --> 00:01:51,400
Dwight, I have exciting
news for you What?

37
00:01:52,986 --> 00:01:54,278
Going to like it

38
00:01:54,362 --> 00:01:55,696
You can't tantalize me

39
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:58,073
Oh, maybe I can

40
00:01:58,158 --> 00:02:00,325
I got an e-mail
from corporate

41
00:02:00,410 --> 00:02:02,452
that told me
Okay.

42
00:02:02,829 --> 00:02:04,496
that you got
a promotion

43
00:02:05,915 --> 00:02:08,876
Right? I mean, that's not the kind of thing
you want to read quietly at your desk

44
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:11,295
If you make me head of sales
one more time, I swear

45
00:02:11,379 --> 00:02:12,379
No. This is legit

46
00:02:12,463 --> 00:02:16,175
You will be assembling a team to
go to Tallahassee for three weeks

47
00:02:16,259 --> 00:02:19,761
to develop and launch
a chain of Sabre stores

48
00:02:20,555 --> 00:02:23,307
Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes

49
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:25,601
Yes! Yes! Yes!

50
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:29,605
Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes

51
00:02:29,939 --> 00:02:31,481
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah
Yeah! Yeah!

52
00:02:31,608 --> 00:02:32,858
The Schrutes
have a word for when

53
00:02:32,942 --> 00:02:36,028
everything in a man's life
comes together perfectly

54
00:02:36,112 --> 00:02:38,030
"Perfektenschlag.'

55
00:02:38,114 --> 00:02:39,865
Right now, I'm in it

56
00:02:39,949 --> 00:02:42,159
I finally get a chance to
prove myself to corporate

57
00:02:42,243 --> 00:02:45,454
a competent team
I am likely a father

58
00:02:45,538 --> 00:02:50,417
I am so deep inside of
perfektenschlag right now

59
00:02:50,501 --> 00:02:53,378
And just to be clear,
there is a second definition

60
00:02:53,463 --> 00:02:55,881
"perfect pork anus, '
which I don't mean

61
00:02:56,257 --> 00:02:58,258
And here's
the fax for you

62
00:02:58,718 --> 00:03:00,552
And here's
some facts for you

63
00:03:00,637 --> 00:03:03,138
Did you know frogs can
hear with their lungs?

64
00:03:03,973 --> 00:03:06,975
And that flamingos can have
orgasms that last 30 minutes

65
00:03:07,936 --> 00:03:10,812
Love to learn. Yeah, it's weird
that I said that last one.

66
00:03:11,231 --> 00:03:12,648
So

67
00:03:12,941 --> 00:03:14,900
Yeah, look at that
We're pin twins.

68
00:03:14,984 --> 00:03:16,318
Pin twins

69
00:03:16,402 --> 00:03:18,904
This is a gift from Jessica
Kind of a gag gift, really

70
00:03:18,988 --> 00:03:20,030
Real gifts come later

71
00:03:20,406 --> 00:03:22,366
Yeah. That's cute

72
00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:25,118
When I saw it at CVS
it made me gag, too. Just

73
00:03:31,542 --> 00:03:34,586
For a while there, I thought
something would change, but nope.

74
00:03:34,671 --> 00:03:35,921
Andy's still with Jessica

75
00:03:36,005 --> 00:03:38,090
They even carpool
together most days.

76
00:03:38,549 --> 00:03:39,549
I don't know.

77
00:03:39,634 --> 00:03:42,594
I wouldn't mind carpooling
every day with Andy,

78
00:03:42,679 --> 00:03:45,305
but I wouldn't want to spend
that much time with Jessica

79
00:03:46,766 --> 00:03:48,976
What do we have here?

80
00:03:53,690 --> 00:03:54,856
Val knit me a beanie.

81
00:03:55,316 --> 00:03:57,025
But I can't tell if it's a
"We're just friends" beanie

82
00:03:57,110 --> 00:04:00,070
or a "I'm hot, you're hot,
let's get it popping" beanie

83
00:04:00,154 --> 00:04:02,990
So I'm going
to up the ante

84
00:04:03,074 --> 00:04:05,701
Give her a clearly
romantic gift.

85
00:04:05,785 --> 00:04:08,370
And we'll get to the
meaning of the beanie.

86
00:04:09,038 --> 00:04:11,123
Pam, pack up your
post-natal swimwear

87
00:04:11,207 --> 00:04:12,833
make it a one piece or
this offer is rescinded

88
00:04:12,917 --> 00:04:16,795
and join me for a fantastic barbeque one
week from today in Tallahassee, Florida

89
00:04:16,879 --> 00:04:18,672
where I'm going to be living
for the next three weeks.

90
00:04:19,090 --> 00:04:20,632
Really?
Mm-hmm

91
00:04:20,717 --> 00:04:22,467
I'll fly anywhere
for some good barbeque

92
00:04:22,552 --> 00:04:23,552
Ooh, me three

93
00:04:23,636 --> 00:04:27,556
No plus ones. This is for
competent workers only.

94
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:30,183
And don't worry about the cost.
Sabre is footing the bill

95
00:04:30,268 --> 00:04:32,644
Does this have anything to do with
what you were talking to Andy about?

96
00:04:32,729 --> 00:04:34,104
God, you're
such a spy.

97
00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:39,735
Notice anything
different about me?

98
00:04:39,819 --> 00:04:41,862
You're wearing the beanie.
You like it?

99
00:04:41,946 --> 00:04:44,698
Super comfortable Like
sweatpants for my head.

100
00:04:46,534 --> 00:04:47,743
It's really itchy

101
00:04:48,119 --> 00:04:51,413
uh, but to be fair, my
head is constantly itching

102
00:04:51,497 --> 00:04:54,082
so I can't really
peg it on the hat

103
00:04:55,209 --> 00:04:58,253
Wow. It's like the Nation
of Islam down here.

104
00:04:58,504 --> 00:05:00,839
Don't hate.

105
00:05:01,507 --> 00:05:03,425
Who's that for?

106
00:05:03,509 --> 00:05:08,180
Oh. This is a gift for
my man Nate here.

107
00:05:08,264 --> 00:05:09,473
What?
Yeah

108
00:05:09,599 --> 00:05:10,891
Darryl, you
shouldn't have

109
00:05:11,934 --> 00:05:14,519
Can I open it? No, no,
no maybe just later

110
00:05:14,604 --> 00:05:16,772
Ah, I can't wait I'm sorry.
I'm too excited.

111
00:05:21,486 --> 00:05:22,694
Darryl

112
00:05:22,779 --> 00:05:24,571
Wow. Those
are really nice

113
00:05:24,655 --> 00:05:26,323
They're so elegant

114
00:05:26,449 --> 00:05:28,283
Cashmere
How did you know?

115
00:05:28,534 --> 00:05:30,285
Just a hunch

116
00:05:31,496 --> 00:05:32,788
Your gift is on the way

117
00:05:32,872 --> 00:05:34,122
Can't wait

118
00:05:35,458 --> 00:05:38,377
"I'm glad you're in my life
Happy Valentine's Day."

119
00:05:38,461 --> 00:05:42,130
Darryl, I am glad
to be in your life, too

120
00:05:43,299 --> 00:05:46,301
Your card is more
beautiful than the gloves

121
00:05:48,971 --> 00:05:52,057
My first task as special project
manager Dwight Schrute,

122
00:05:52,141 --> 00:05:54,017
assembling a crack team.

123
00:05:54,936 --> 00:05:56,853
I need people who are loyal,

124
00:05:57,146 --> 00:06:00,982
people who will help me get an inroad
with the gay Hispanic community.

125
00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:03,235
People who won't be missed.

126
00:06:04,404 --> 00:06:06,363
We don't need idiots.

127
00:06:07,532 --> 00:06:09,074
Good for nothings.

128
00:06:09,742 --> 00:06:10,992
Meth heads.

129
00:06:12,328 --> 00:06:13,495
Or...

130
00:06:13,955 --> 00:06:14,996
What's your name?

131
00:06:15,164 --> 00:06:17,207
Cathy
Cathy.

132
00:06:23,172 --> 00:06:24,881
I just got a text from
Robert California that says

133
00:06:24,966 --> 00:06:26,508
"Bring your clubs
to Florida."

134
00:06:26,801 --> 00:06:28,844
Why? Does he think you're
going to Florida?

135
00:06:29,178 --> 00:06:31,555
I hope not. Because
I am not going.

136
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:33,765
Two question marks?

137
00:06:33,850 --> 00:06:37,436
No, just do one. Two question
marks is kind of aggressive

138
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,312
You know, it's like
"Well, what?"

139
00:06:39,605 --> 00:06:41,314
Just do one

140
00:06:42,066 --> 00:06:45,026
You want to take Darryl Phyllis,
Toby, Angela and Oscar?

141
00:06:45,111 --> 00:06:46,111
Yes

142
00:06:46,195 --> 00:06:48,655
Can I interest you
in someone less essential?

143
00:06:48,739 --> 00:06:51,032
Like a Creed or a
Meredith perhaps?

144
00:06:51,117 --> 00:06:53,201
Oh, my God They're not
expendable exactly

145
00:06:53,286 --> 00:06:55,787
I can't think of the word
I'm trying to find

146
00:06:55,872 --> 00:06:57,038
Are you kidding me?

147
00:06:57,123 --> 00:06:58,999
I'm supposed to get on an
airplane with those nincompoops?

148
00:06:59,083 --> 00:07:00,167
We'd never make it
off the runway

149
00:07:00,251 --> 00:07:03,670
All right, look, I got to keep
this office functioning somehow

150
00:07:03,754 --> 00:07:06,423
so I have put
together a list

151
00:07:06,507 --> 00:07:07,966
Here's your team

152
00:07:08,050 --> 00:07:09,593
Darryl and Phyllis
you can have

153
00:07:10,136 --> 00:07:12,053
You're also taking Cathy
Kelly and Kevin.

154
00:07:12,388 --> 00:07:14,222
Oh, God.
You have your team

155
00:07:14,474 --> 00:07:17,726
Kevin? Kelly? Cathy?

156
00:07:17,810 --> 00:07:20,187
Andy just gave me a chain
with three weak links

157
00:07:20,271 --> 00:07:23,356
Have you ever tried to use a chain
with three weak links? I have

158
00:07:23,441 --> 00:07:25,901
And now I no longer
own an Arctic Wolf

159
00:07:27,987 --> 00:07:29,237
Well, let's hear it

160
00:07:29,238 --> 00:07:31,990
"Robert, hey,"
exclamation point I like it so far

161
00:07:32,074 --> 00:07:33,658
"Got your text
Awesome idea

162
00:07:33,743 --> 00:07:37,120
"Let's hit the links the next
time you're in PA. -J.H.'

163
00:07:38,331 --> 00:07:42,083
It's perfect. You emphasize the
golf, completely omit the Florida

164
00:07:42,251 --> 00:07:43,418
Yeah, it's a golf text

165
00:07:43,711 --> 00:07:45,462
Total golf text. Send it

166
00:07:46,214 --> 00:07:50,509
Done. Wait, I just feel weird
I should just call him

167
00:07:50,593 --> 00:07:54,679
You want to call someone that texted you?
Do you want to drive them away? I mean

168
00:07:58,434 --> 00:07:59,643
This is Darryl

169
00:07:59,727 --> 00:08:02,020
Sorry, I asked for
the main shipment number.

170
00:08:02,104 --> 00:08:03,647
I just need the address
for the warehouse.

171
00:08:03,731 --> 00:08:05,315
My girlfriend
some flowers.

172
00:08:06,234 --> 00:08:09,110
Your girlfriend?
Is your girlfriend Val?

173
00:08:09,195 --> 00:08:11,112
Yeah. Do you know her?

174
00:08:11,572 --> 00:08:15,200
We're friends
We're friends

175
00:08:16,202 --> 00:08:18,870
Cool. So can I get
that address or...

176
00:08:19,413 --> 00:08:22,207
Yeah, yeah. Sorry I'm
just looking for a pen

177
00:08:22,291 --> 00:08:23,333
Why do you
need a pen?

178
00:08:23,417 --> 00:08:25,252
Back off I got my reasons

179
00:08:26,087 --> 00:08:27,212
May I have your
attention, please?

180
00:08:27,296 --> 00:08:29,047
Could Cathy, Phyllis,
Darryl, Kevin and Kelly

181
00:08:29,131 --> 00:08:31,132
please join me in the
conference room immediately?

182
00:08:31,342 --> 00:08:32,676
Why?
No big deal

183
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:35,971
It's just that you five have been
deemed most deserving of a three-week

184
00:08:36,055 --> 00:08:38,473
all expenses paid business
trip to Tallahassee, Florida

185
00:08:38,808 --> 00:08:40,600
Hell, yeah
What?

186
00:08:40,685 --> 00:08:43,895
I'm sorry, Stanley. I can't
share any more details with you

187
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:46,064
You see
Andy rejected you

188
00:08:46,148 --> 00:08:48,149
Wait
Cathy gets to go?

189
00:08:48,234 --> 00:08:50,443
Why does she even still work here?
Pam is back.

190
00:08:50,528 --> 00:08:51,903
It just feels like
a slap in the face

191
00:08:51,988 --> 00:08:53,738
I can understand your pain.
And your rage.

192
00:08:53,823 --> 00:08:55,991
But you know what?
Andy is an honorable man

193
00:08:56,075 --> 00:08:59,286
Let us not question his choices.
I'm sure he had his reasons.

194
00:08:59,370 --> 00:09:01,830
We're not questioning his reasons.
I just want to know what they are

195
00:09:01,956 --> 00:09:03,164
I know. You and me
both, brother.

196
00:09:03,249 --> 00:09:04,416
It seemed kind
of random to me

197
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:08,378
but he was pretty clear on who he thought
truly deserved this boondoggle of a lifetime.

198
00:09:08,462 --> 00:09:13,133
Well, he nailed it because
I do deserve a vacation

199
00:09:13,217 --> 00:09:15,594
Sometimes Batman's
got to take off his cape

200
00:09:15,678 --> 00:09:18,888
Good point. But we're going to be
working pretty hard until 5:00 p.m

201
00:09:18,973 --> 00:09:22,851
After that, it's going to be beach
volleyball trips to Cape Canaveral

202
00:09:22,935 --> 00:09:24,853
and sea kayaking
with Gloria Estefan

203
00:09:25,062 --> 00:09:26,605
What were the
criteria for going?

204
00:09:26,689 --> 00:09:30,025
It might be innate goodness
versus innate badness

205
00:09:30,318 --> 00:09:32,193
But there's an easy
way to find out

206
00:09:34,030 --> 00:09:37,032
Oh, Andy, got a few
questions for you

207
00:09:37,908 --> 00:09:39,701
Moshi moshi.

208
00:09:40,494 --> 00:09:42,412
Uh, the Florida
picks got out,

209
00:09:42,496 --> 00:09:45,457
and people were just kind of curious
as to why they weren't picked,

210
00:09:45,541 --> 00:09:47,459
and maybe you
could just clarify

211
00:09:47,543 --> 00:09:48,543
Uh.

212
00:09:49,962 --> 00:09:55,133
Well, the deliberations were confidential,
so I feel like we should respect that.

213
00:09:55,217 --> 00:09:57,093
Respect it? You're
trying to tell me

214
00:09:57,178 --> 00:09:59,387
Kevin Malone deserves more
than Stanley Hudson?

215
00:09:59,847 --> 00:10:01,640
Hey
Okay, it's obvious

216
00:10:01,724 --> 00:10:04,976
that Andy picked the people that
are least important to the office.

217
00:10:05,061 --> 00:10:07,646
Important? Because you and
your enormous monster baby

218
00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:08,813
are so important
to the branch?

219
00:10:08,898 --> 00:10:10,732
My baby is
not a monster

220
00:10:10,816 --> 00:10:13,193
Hey, be proud of your
enormous monster baby

221
00:10:13,277 --> 00:10:14,986
an enormous
monster baby

222
00:10:15,071 --> 00:10:18,365
Guys! Guys! Guys

223
00:10:18,616 --> 00:10:23,453
Come on, seriously, we cannot let this
trip cause this kind of rift, guys

224
00:10:23,537 --> 00:10:24,829
Stop calling us "guys"

225
00:10:24,997 --> 00:10:28,917
when I'm nervous, guys

226
00:10:29,418 --> 00:10:31,211
Guys, guys, guys. Guys.
- Stop it

227
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:33,171
Stop! Stop it! Andy

228
00:10:34,048 --> 00:10:35,632
Dudes

229
00:10:35,716 --> 00:10:40,011
The dudes who are going to Florida
were picked by Dwight and me

230
00:10:40,096 --> 00:10:42,013
Okay, hey, I
specifically remember

231
00:10:42,098 --> 00:10:44,307
that there were a lot of other people
I thought should be considered.

232
00:10:44,392 --> 00:10:45,433
Uh.

233
00:10:45,518 --> 00:10:47,435
If anybody's going to
Florida, it should be me.

234
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:50,689
Every shirt that I have that isn't
a work shirt is a Tommy Bahama.

235
00:10:50,773 --> 00:10:53,441
I'm the only person in this
office who watches Burn Notice.

236
00:10:53,609 --> 00:10:56,695
Okay. I did not realize that so
many of you wanted to go so badly

237
00:10:56,779 --> 00:10:59,864
so if you feel like you have a
very good reason to go to Florida,

238
00:10:59,949 --> 00:11:01,449
I'm happy to hear you out.
Great idea

239
00:11:01,534 --> 00:11:03,535
So why doesn't everyone just
take the next five to six hours

240
00:11:03,619 --> 00:11:05,995
come up with a statement on why you
feel you deserve to go to Florida,

241
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,080
and Andy and I
will listen to it.

242
00:11:07,206 --> 00:11:09,833
No, that is a ridiculous waste of time.
For you maybe

243
00:11:10,209 --> 00:11:11,751
Five to six hours?
Three to four hours

244
00:11:11,836 --> 00:11:14,045
No, no, no, no. No.
Just two to three hours

245
00:11:14,130 --> 00:11:16,548
Come up with a statement
over the next hour.

246
00:11:16,632 --> 00:11:17,632
Thirty minutes

247
00:11:18,217 --> 00:11:19,467
I'm out

248
00:11:19,635 --> 00:11:21,010
Okay, read it
back to me

249
00:11:21,095 --> 00:11:23,555
"Robert, great offer. Wish I could
hit the links with you in Florida,

250
00:11:23,639 --> 00:11:26,808
"but a father of a newborn really should be
helping out his wife any chance he gets.'

251
00:11:27,226 --> 00:11:30,437
Good. Doesn't sound pushy
You're just stating a fact

252
00:11:30,521 --> 00:11:32,480
Absolutely
Works for me

253
00:11:33,023 --> 00:11:35,108
Okay. Sending.

254
00:11:35,192 --> 00:11:37,610
Well done. And we managed
to kill the entire morning

255
00:11:37,695 --> 00:11:39,320
We really did

256
00:11:45,369 --> 00:11:46,995
He responded, "L.O.L.'

257
00:11:55,588 --> 00:11:58,590
I am already...

258
00:11:58,674 --> 00:12:02,385
I already picked my team, Darryl,
Oscar, Angela, Phyllis and Toby.

259
00:12:02,553 --> 00:12:04,345
And that is the team
that I am taking.

260
00:12:04,764 --> 00:12:07,766
What's that? It's not up to me?
I only have influence?

261
00:12:07,850 --> 00:12:10,643
Well, that's all
Baltzer Glattfuelder had

262
00:12:10,728 --> 00:12:13,396
and now no one eats
owls for Thanksgiving

263
00:12:13,981 --> 00:12:16,065
You have two young dynamic
people in this office

264
00:12:16,150 --> 00:12:17,859
who know trends
who know youth.

265
00:12:17,943 --> 00:12:20,945
That's myself and Kelly Kapoor
you need one of us there

266
00:12:22,031 --> 00:12:24,866
Or both? Not both. Just one. Me

267
00:12:24,950 --> 00:12:27,410
Or if not me, Kelly
Ideally me

268
00:12:27,495 --> 00:12:28,828
Again, youth knowledge

269
00:12:28,913 --> 00:12:31,539
that's what you get when you put Ryan
Howard on your special project team

270
00:12:32,041 --> 00:12:35,210
Or Kelly Kapoor.
Again, not both. Thanks

271
00:12:36,545 --> 00:12:38,171
Very impressive

272
00:12:38,297 --> 00:12:40,715
He put a lot of work into that.
Mm-hmm

273
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,801
PowerPoints are the peacocks
of the business world

274
00:12:42,885 --> 00:12:44,427
All show, no meat

275
00:12:45,054 --> 00:12:48,640
Because I feel like that I am in
a place with my gambling rehab

276
00:12:48,724 --> 00:12:52,060
that I can finally start
going to dog racing again

277
00:12:52,686 --> 00:12:57,148
You know, just sitting
watching, enjoying the sport

278
00:12:57,233 --> 00:13:01,486
Maybe putting down a few dollars if there's
like a crazy mismatch or something

279
00:13:01,570 --> 00:13:03,655
Okay. Thank you Kevin,
we'll let you know.

280
00:13:03,739 --> 00:13:05,406
Thank you.
When do we leave?

281
00:13:05,699 --> 00:13:07,075
Thank you

282
00:13:07,368 --> 00:13:10,411
It really has been
a long, lonely winter

283
00:13:10,579 --> 00:13:14,457
Wow. Seasonal affective
disorder, a.k.a. SAD.

284
00:13:14,542 --> 00:13:16,918
That sounds like
a very real thing, Toby

285
00:13:17,127 --> 00:13:19,754
It is real. Thank you
for saying that

286
00:13:20,047 --> 00:13:22,632
Yeah, wow,
it's almost like

287
00:13:22,716 --> 00:13:26,678
we're not all experiencing
the same winter

288
00:13:26,762 --> 00:13:30,431
Florida Stanley smiles Florida
Stanley is happy to go to work

289
00:13:30,516 --> 00:13:33,268
Florida Stanley is who you
want on your Florida team

290
00:13:35,855 --> 00:13:37,981
It's still... Well
she does here

291
00:13:38,065 --> 00:13:39,941
Hey, guys.
Any spots left?

292
00:13:40,317 --> 00:13:41,943
Erin, you want to go
to Tallahassee?

293
00:13:44,113 --> 00:13:46,239
I think it would be a
nice way to clear my head

294
00:13:47,533 --> 00:13:49,784
You know, I don't think it's a good
idea for you to clear your head

295
00:13:49,869 --> 00:13:51,703
any more than it
has been already

296
00:13:51,787 --> 00:13:53,454
a workplace where

297
00:13:53,539 --> 00:13:57,000
the burdens of everyday life
keep you tethered to reality

298
00:13:57,459 --> 00:13:58,501
Either or

299
00:13:58,586 --> 00:14:01,254
But if you can find someone to
fill in, I would love to go

300
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:03,464
Well, it wouldn't be hard
to find someone to fill in

301
00:14:04,633 --> 00:14:07,844
Really? Oh, great. Good

302
00:14:08,596 --> 00:14:11,139
Now, is it too dark to say that
Cece's having an operation?

303
00:14:11,724 --> 00:14:13,141
I think you need
to go to Florida.

304
00:14:15,436 --> 00:14:17,729
It's only for three weeks

305
00:14:17,813 --> 00:14:19,898
You know, with my mom and
sister at the house, it'll be

306
00:14:19,982 --> 00:14:21,024
A total nightmare

307
00:14:21,358 --> 00:14:24,110
because I'll have
all the help I need

308
00:14:24,194 --> 00:14:25,778
Yeah, that's what I'm saying
They're incredibly helpful.

309
00:14:25,863 --> 00:14:27,113
You're lucky
to have them

310
00:14:27,197 --> 00:14:28,781
With them there, you probably
won't even know I'm gone

311
00:14:28,866 --> 00:14:30,116
Exactly

312
00:14:32,828 --> 00:14:33,828
Well

313
00:14:34,163 --> 00:14:39,167
No. No! Absolutely not You are not going!
Over my dead body, no. Andy

314
00:14:39,251 --> 00:14:41,461
Toons, I'm really sorry

315
00:14:41,545 --> 00:14:43,755
You're too essential to the
operation here I can't let you go.

316
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:46,299
I wouldn't say that
That's a bit much

317
00:14:46,383 --> 00:14:47,717
You know, Dwight if you
didn't want me to go

318
00:14:47,801 --> 00:14:50,887
the smart move would be to tell Andy that
I actually am essential to the operation

319
00:14:50,971 --> 00:14:52,138
That way, I couldn't go

320
00:14:53,182 --> 00:14:55,433
Jim is essential Hold on. I
just want to get it on camera.

321
00:14:57,353 --> 00:15:00,980
Andy, Jim is just too

322
00:15:01,190 --> 00:15:02,190
Essential

323
00:15:02,816 --> 00:15:03,983
This is stupid! Cut

324
00:15:04,193 --> 00:15:05,360
All right. I'm going
to pack my trunks

325
00:15:05,444 --> 00:15:06,486
He doesn't even
want to go.

326
00:15:06,654 --> 00:15:07,987
Well, I got a text
from R.C.

327
00:15:08,072 --> 00:15:11,658
inviting me to come down so I think
that's going to make us roommates.

328
00:15:12,868 --> 00:15:13,910
Oh, my God

329
00:15:14,119 --> 00:15:17,121
Hey, quick question, do you shower at
night? Or do you shower in the morning?

330
00:15:17,206 --> 00:15:19,707
Because I want to shower when
you're showering to save some water

331
00:15:22,127 --> 00:15:24,712
Okay, listen up, everyone
Here's who's going to Florida

332
00:15:25,255 --> 00:15:26,422
Cathy
What?

333
00:15:26,507 --> 00:15:27,632
Stanley.
No

334
00:15:27,716 --> 00:15:28,841
Ryan.
No

335
00:15:28,926 --> 00:15:30,051
Erin.

336
00:15:30,135 --> 00:15:31,386
And Jim

337
00:15:31,470 --> 00:15:33,721
You got to be ♪
kidding me. Okay

338
00:15:34,723 --> 00:15:36,057
Okay

339
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:38,893
Florida group,
welcome to the team

340
00:15:48,404 --> 00:15:50,321
Let's go

341
00:15:50,406 --> 00:15:53,658
Step it up, you runts.
You infants. Let's move

342
00:15:53,742 --> 00:15:55,159
Why is it so
hot in here?

343
00:15:55,244 --> 00:15:59,288
Hot? What are you talking about? This
is a nice, temperate Florida morning

344
00:15:59,373 --> 00:16:01,416
Eighty-five degrees
73% humidity.

345
00:16:02,084 --> 00:16:04,043
This is the exact environment
that you will be facing

346
00:16:04,128 --> 00:16:06,170
for the next three
weeks of your life.

347
00:16:06,255 --> 00:16:09,674
Welcome to Special
Projects orientation.

348
00:16:09,758 --> 00:16:11,801
The next three weeks
of your life

349
00:16:11,885 --> 00:16:15,263
are going to be the most
miserable you've ever faced.

350
00:16:15,347 --> 00:16:18,057
They're going to be hard
They're going to be dirty

351
00:16:18,142 --> 00:16:20,435
You're going to
wish you were dead

352
00:16:21,353 --> 00:16:22,353
But?

353
00:16:22,438 --> 00:16:24,147
"But?" There's no "buts.'

354
00:16:24,231 --> 00:16:27,108
That's it. You'll wish you were dead.
You seem a little disturbed

355
00:16:27,234 --> 00:16:28,901
Do you want to stay here?
No. No. I want to go.

356
00:16:28,986 --> 00:16:32,196
Because if any of you
would prefer to stay here

357
00:16:32,281 --> 00:16:34,407
all you need to do
is ring this bell

358
00:16:35,159 --> 00:16:36,284
Is that the buzzer
from Taboo?

359
00:16:36,952 --> 00:16:38,661
Shut up, maggot
It is.

360
00:16:38,746 --> 00:16:40,413
You don't want to go
ring the be

361
00:16:40,748 --> 00:16:42,457
Ring it. Ring it

362
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:45,793
How many of you have seen the
documentary Deliverance?

363
00:16:47,379 --> 00:16:49,005
How did a mosquito
get in here?

364
00:16:49,631 --> 00:16:51,883
I released 300 mosquitoes
into the conference room.

365
00:16:51,967 --> 00:16:53,217
Just temporarily

366
00:16:53,302 --> 00:16:56,095
When I'm done, the frogs will
take care of the mosquitoes.

367
00:16:58,807 --> 00:17:02,518
Yes. And then he brushes
your soft supple cheeks

368
00:17:02,603 --> 00:17:05,855
with his worn leathery
hands and says

369
00:17:05,939 --> 00:17:09,067
"I'm going to make you
the seventh Mrs. Rosenblat!'

370
00:17:09,401 --> 00:17:10,818
Unless you ring
the bell. Ring it

371
00:17:10,903 --> 00:17:11,986
No.
Ring the bell

372
00:17:12,071 --> 00:17:14,906
You want to spend the rest of your life
changing your husband's colostomy bags?

373
00:17:14,990 --> 00:17:17,325
Huh? Do you? Ring it
What? Ah.

374
00:17:18,911 --> 00:17:20,328
What was that?
Mosquito

375
00:17:27,086 --> 00:17:29,087
Orientation's over

376
00:17:30,756 --> 00:17:32,507
Darryl, hey

377
00:17:32,591 --> 00:17:33,674
Hey, what's up?
You called?

378
00:17:33,926 --> 00:17:35,968
Yeah, you know,
I felt really terrible

379
00:17:36,053 --> 00:17:38,513
that you got me these lovely gloves,
and I didn't get you anything

380
00:17:38,597 --> 00:17:39,639
It's cool, really

381
00:17:39,723 --> 00:17:41,557
No, it's anything
but cool.

382
00:17:41,642 --> 00:17:46,771
Now, I haven't really had time to
go out and buy you anything, but

383
00:17:46,855 --> 00:17:48,272
here goes

384
00:17:48,357 --> 00:17:51,984
"This coupon entitles you to one
free tickle monster attack."

385
00:17:52,069 --> 00:17:55,571
Yeah. They're Nate coupons or
Nate-pons And they're all different

386
00:17:55,823 --> 00:17:58,407
Cash that one in and I will
bring you a stick of gum

387
00:17:58,909 --> 00:18:01,953
any time, any place
I'll find you.

388
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:04,330
Thanks

389
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:07,291
Nice flowers

390
00:18:07,376 --> 00:18:08,918
Thanks. They're
from my mom.

391
00:18:10,379 --> 00:18:11,796
Your mom?

392
00:18:12,798 --> 00:18:14,132
Yeah

393
00:18:14,216 --> 00:18:15,424
Oh

394
00:18:15,509 --> 00:18:19,262
So I guess that was your mom who called
me earlier looking for the address.

395
00:18:19,346 --> 00:18:20,555
Real deep-voiced woman

396
00:18:21,098 --> 00:18:22,223
Yeah, that's her

397
00:18:22,307 --> 00:18:25,226
She said her name
was Brandon, I think

398
00:18:25,310 --> 00:18:26,853
Your mom's name
is Brandon?

399
00:18:28,772 --> 00:18:32,024
Yeah, Darryl. My mom's
name is Brandon

400
00:18:35,904 --> 00:18:38,948
out where I stand

401
00:18:39,032 --> 00:18:42,076
This is a love beanie

402
00:18:45,581 --> 00:18:48,332
Okay, Florida team
let's reconvene.

403
00:18:59,136 --> 00:19:02,430
I'm going to Florida
And I'm not coming back

404
00:19:05,392 --> 00:19:08,853
So Sabre has set up a conference room
for our use while we're at corporate.

405
00:19:08,937 --> 00:19:10,771
So what is this
special project?

406
00:19:10,939 --> 00:19:12,565
Basically, Sabre has
tasked us with

407
00:19:12,649 --> 00:19:14,567
helping them branch into
the retail market place

408
00:19:14,651 --> 00:19:16,444
They want to set up their own
version of an Apple store.

409
00:19:16,737 --> 00:19:17,778
That sounds awesome

410
00:19:18,030 --> 00:19:19,739
It did. It did

411
00:19:19,823 --> 00:19:20,865
You know what
might be great?

412
00:19:20,949 --> 00:19:23,743
Is if instead of a genius
bar, we have a lounge area

413
00:19:23,827 --> 00:19:26,037
where people can ask
questions about the product

414
00:19:26,121 --> 00:19:27,622
with other customers
who liked it

415
00:19:28,457 --> 00:19:31,626
Yeah, and they should have a place where
people can check their computers or printers

416
00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:34,170
before they see you, so you don't
have to carry it around like a dope

417
00:19:34,713 --> 00:19:35,796
Like a coat check

418
00:19:41,386 --> 00:19:42,720
Oh, don't write it down
unless you like it

419
00:19:42,804 --> 00:19:43,804
Oh, I like it

420
00:19:44,389 --> 00:19:46,891
It seems to me that the Apple
store is kind of like a party

421
00:19:46,975 --> 00:19:49,810
so I think our question is how
do we make this a better party?

422
00:19:49,895 --> 00:19:53,564
No. We sell business tools and
the stores need to reflect that.

423
00:19:53,649 --> 00:19:56,984
They need to be all business Let all the
other stores look like a toy store.

424
00:19:57,110 --> 00:20:00,404
Right. Think different
From Apple.

425
00:20:03,242 --> 00:20:05,326
Dwight, is now a good time to
go over what you expect of us?

426
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,460
Yes

427
00:20:14,544 --> 00:20:16,379
What are my expectations
for the group?

428
00:20:16,505 --> 00:20:19,924
I have been given the responsibility
to manage Stanley, a solid player.

429
00:20:20,008 --> 00:20:22,134
Ryan, who is capable
of surprises.

430
00:20:22,386 --> 00:20:24,053
Erin, an excellent
follower.

431
00:20:24,471 --> 00:20:27,515
And Cathy, a probably not
totally useless enigma.

432
00:20:27,641 --> 00:20:30,017
And, well, Jim.

433
00:20:30,936 --> 00:20:34,355
Under the right manager
that's not a bad team.

434
00:20:35,399 --> 00:20:37,191
Perfektenschlag

435
00:20:44,074 --> 00:20:45,533
I'm going to live here
without you

436
00:20:45,826 --> 00:20:48,286
Me neither. Hey, will you
put this coat on my chair?

437
00:20:48,370 --> 00:20:49,704
I just realized I'm not
going to need it down there

438
00:20:50,038 --> 00:20:51,414
Yes, I will take
your coat.

439
00:20:51,498 --> 00:20:52,832
And I will keep it
with me

440
00:20:52,916 --> 00:20:54,625
and I will sleep with it
because it smells like you

441
00:20:54,710 --> 00:20:56,043
No, no, no, no, no.
Just put it on my chair

442
00:20:58,046 --> 00:20:59,255
All right
Bye

443
00:20:59,339 --> 00:21:01,757
Bye. Call me when
you land I will.

444
00:21:02,759 --> 00:21:04,051
Safe travels

445
00:21:04,428 --> 00:21:07,221
Goodbye for a very
very long time.

446
00:21:08,307 --> 00:21:09,390
Okay

447
00:21:09,850 --> 00:21:11,225
It's only three weeks

448
00:21:15,814 --> 00:21:17,231
All expenses paid

449
00:21:18,317 --> 00:21:19,775
Yeah. Jim's going
to be there.

450
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:23,237
That marriage is not good
Nobody knows better than me

451
00:21:24,531 --> 00:21:26,073
Definitely, we will

452
00:21:26,158 --> 00:21:29,368
It's three weeks in Tallahassee.
What else is there to do?
