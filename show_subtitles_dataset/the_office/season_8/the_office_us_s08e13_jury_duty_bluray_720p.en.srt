1
00:00:04,554 --> 00:00:06,013
Val, I need the space

2
00:00:06,890 --> 00:00:08,015
All right
guys, clear out

3
00:00:08,099 --> 00:00:09,058
Everybody out

4
00:00:09,142 --> 00:00:10,350
Promise me you're
going to clean up.

5
00:00:10,435 --> 00:00:12,686
What I'm going
to do or not do

6
00:00:12,771 --> 00:00:13,771
Promise me

7
00:00:13,855 --> 00:00:15,147
Obviously
I'm going to clean up

8
00:00:15,231 --> 00:00:18,108
Stress is like the uptight
mayor of a town who's saying

9
00:00:18,193 --> 00:00:20,360
"Hey, we're uptight
You can't dance."

10
00:00:20,445 --> 00:00:24,156
And then, you have to be like "Oh,
yeah, Mayor Stress? Well, watch this.'

11
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:26,492
And then, we dance.

12
00:00:28,536 --> 00:00:30,370
Oh, how we dance.

13
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:06,782
Sex also works

14
00:01:30,598 --> 00:01:32,349
Hey, Jim's back
from jury duty.

15
00:01:32,433 --> 00:01:35,894
Hey! Tuna
He's back

16
00:01:36,437 --> 00:01:37,437
Hey

17
00:01:37,522 --> 00:01:38,480
Oh, look at this

18
00:01:38,565 --> 00:01:40,315
Tuna wrap
Okay

19
00:01:41,776 --> 00:01:43,110
Hand roll

20
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:44,987
How was jury duty?

21
00:01:45,238 --> 00:01:46,530
Pretty uneventful
actually.

22
00:01:46,614 --> 00:01:48,824
Let someone like you
serve on a jury

23
00:01:48,908 --> 00:01:50,868
Makes me question
the whole judicial system

24
00:01:51,077 --> 00:01:52,161
What was the case?

25
00:01:52,245 --> 00:01:53,328
A hit and run

26
00:01:53,913 --> 00:01:55,831
Ooh! The case of the hit and run.
That's exciting.

27
00:01:55,915 --> 00:01:57,249
Did you send him
to the slammer?

28
00:01:57,333 --> 00:01:58,876
No. Not guilty

29
00:01:59,085 --> 00:02:00,586
Of course you
found him not guilty

30
00:02:01,337 --> 00:02:04,590
He apologized And I just really
want him to like me. Mmm!

31
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:06,383
We're best friends
actually.

32
00:02:06,467 --> 00:02:08,510
We're going wine tasting next
weekend if you want to come

33
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:09,887
Not coming
Have plans.

34
00:02:10,013 --> 00:02:11,180
Okay

35
00:02:11,264 --> 00:02:13,473
I did get called
into jury duty

36
00:02:13,558 --> 00:02:15,434
And they
released me around noon

37
00:02:15,518 --> 00:02:17,519
so I didn't
think it was worth it

38
00:02:17,604 --> 00:02:19,646
to come back to work
for a half day.

39
00:02:19,731 --> 00:02:22,691
And then the next morning, Pam was
a little overwhelmed with the kids

40
00:02:22,775 --> 00:02:25,277
so I took an extra day
to help out.

41
00:02:26,279 --> 00:02:28,739
And then
three other days happened

42
00:02:29,574 --> 00:02:30,782
Ah

43
00:02:31,117 --> 00:02:32,784
Angela had the baby

44
00:02:33,036 --> 00:02:35,913
Is it black? Because
that would be hilarious

45
00:02:35,997 --> 00:02:37,080
Why?

46
00:02:37,999 --> 00:02:39,166
You know

47
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:42,127
Would it be more hilarious than
Angela having a Chinese baby?

48
00:02:42,587 --> 00:02:45,964
A little bit. Yeah.
Right, guys? Back me up

49
00:02:46,966 --> 00:02:47,925
Maybe a little bit

50
00:02:48,009 --> 00:02:49,760
Oh. Did I win the pool?

51
00:02:50,261 --> 00:02:52,346
Uh, no Right month wrong year.

52
00:02:52,931 --> 00:02:55,515
No one won the pool Angela
wasn't due for another month.

53
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:57,559
We should all go to
the hospital and visit her

54
00:02:57,644 --> 00:02:59,770
Oh, I'd love to, but

55
00:03:00,021 --> 00:03:02,397
Oh, man, I would, but I
can't miss any more work

56
00:03:02,482 --> 00:03:05,984
Well, Kevin and I have to go because
accounting is its own little family.

57
00:03:06,069 --> 00:03:10,864
Yeah, Oscar's the dad I'm Oscar's
dad and Angela's my mom.

58
00:03:11,366 --> 00:03:13,700
Everyone,
our very own Angela

59
00:03:13,785 --> 00:03:15,827
We all got the e-mail Some
of us are going to go visit

60
00:03:16,037 --> 00:03:17,579
Oh, I am so in

61
00:03:20,166 --> 00:03:22,251
It's the perfect blend
of love and horror

62
00:03:22,335 --> 00:03:25,087
Things can go so
wrong or so right

63
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:30,384
Come on, Judge Judy tell us your case.
What were the deets?

64
00:03:30,468 --> 00:03:32,094
It was actually
a pretty boring case

65
00:03:32,178 --> 00:03:35,222
How could it be boring? You were
there for five days Titillate us

66
00:03:35,306 --> 00:03:38,558
Yeah, you owe us. I had to stay
until 6:00 twice to cover for you.

67
00:03:38,851 --> 00:03:40,435
My wife got to
the TV first.

68
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:43,105
I had to sit through damn
Rizzoli & damn Isles.

69
00:03:43,189 --> 00:03:45,983
Yeah. My car got smashed
visiting one of your clients

70
00:03:46,067 --> 00:03:49,069
and I had to have it detailed
and they took my meter change

71
00:03:49,404 --> 00:03:50,445
Wow. I'm really sorry

72
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:51,571
Yeah

73
00:03:51,990 --> 00:03:53,907
I never considered
that my week off

74
00:03:53,992 --> 00:03:56,493
would make everyone
else's job harder

75
00:03:57,662 --> 00:03:59,705
The least I could do
was give them a good story

76
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:01,957
So Phyllis
he was here and then

77
00:04:02,041 --> 00:04:04,626
the car came and
it was like that.

78
00:04:04,711 --> 00:04:06,795
Yeah, so it had to be a
double backflip, actually

79
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:10,424
You know when I was on
J-duties strangler case,

80
00:04:10,508 --> 00:04:15,387
we used to recreate the various
stranglings with empanadas from Ernesto's

81
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,222
Oh, man, Ernesto's

82
00:04:17,307 --> 00:04:18,932
That was our
favorite restaurant, too

83
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:21,268
You mean food truck
Ernesto's was a food truck

84
00:04:21,352 --> 00:04:22,894
Toby, shut your hole
about the empanadas

85
00:04:22,979 --> 00:04:24,813
Nobody cares
about the empanadas

86
00:04:25,023 --> 00:04:26,606
I was in Los Angeles
last year

87
00:04:26,691 --> 00:04:30,152
Jim tricked me into thinking I'd
won a walk-on part on NCIS,

88
00:04:30,236 --> 00:04:31,194
but that's not important

89
00:04:31,279 --> 00:04:34,823
While I was being kicked off the
lot, I saw food trucks everywhere

90
00:04:34,907 --> 00:04:36,783
Everyone in Los Angeles
eats from them

91
00:04:36,868 --> 00:04:39,870
and nobody calls
them restaurants

92
00:04:46,502 --> 00:04:49,671
Guys, I don't know how
many of you have seen

93
00:04:49,756 --> 00:04:51,506
Gabe, bring it in

94
00:04:51,591 --> 00:04:54,509
how many of you have seen
a premature baby before.

95
00:04:54,594 --> 00:04:57,471
It's going to be really tiny so
please don't say anything offensive

96
00:04:57,930 --> 00:04:59,097
Got that, bimbo?

97
00:04:59,182 --> 00:05:00,682
Got it, bimbo

98
00:05:01,893 --> 00:05:02,934
Yes?

99
00:05:03,519 --> 00:05:05,062
Knock, knock.

100
00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:06,772
Hi.
- Uh

101
00:05:09,817 --> 00:05:12,527
I don't want What are
you guys doing here?

102
00:05:12,612 --> 00:05:14,905
We wanted to say hi to the
newest little Dunder Mifflinite

103
00:05:14,989 --> 00:05:20,577
Well, meet our not-so-little bundle
of joy Philip Halsted Lipton

104
00:05:20,787 --> 00:05:22,204
Philip is so fat

105
00:05:22,288 --> 00:05:23,413
Kevin

106
00:05:23,498 --> 00:05:25,916
You warned me not to say
anything if it was tiny, Oscar

107
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,877
You didn't prepare me
for a big, giant, fat baby

108
00:05:28,961 --> 00:05:30,796
Yes, he's substantial
Hey

109
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:33,799
He's more than substantial
He's a monster.

110
00:05:36,844 --> 00:05:38,053
So this whole
hit and run thing

111
00:05:38,137 --> 00:05:40,055
there's this one part
I can't figure out.

112
00:05:40,139 --> 00:05:41,598
You said it was
at a four-way stop?

113
00:05:41,682 --> 00:05:42,682
Mmm-hmm

114
00:05:42,809 --> 00:05:46,853
And the victim rode his bicycle
into the left-hand turn lane

115
00:05:46,938 --> 00:05:49,648
but the perp was already in
the left-hand turn lane?

116
00:05:49,941 --> 00:05:50,982
Mmm-hmm

117
00:05:51,109 --> 00:05:54,820
See, that's what I'm having
trouble with, because the fact is

118
00:05:56,155 --> 00:05:58,532
you never said he
was on a bicycle.

119
00:06:03,287 --> 00:06:05,414
Busted, Halpert! Yes
Wait. No

120
00:06:05,498 --> 00:06:06,665
Andy, get out here

121
00:06:06,749 --> 00:06:07,874
was on a bicycle

122
00:06:07,959 --> 00:06:09,292
wasn't listening to you

123
00:06:09,377 --> 00:06:10,627
a citizen's arrest

124
00:06:10,711 --> 00:06:11,962
You have the right
to remain silent.

125
00:06:12,046 --> 00:06:13,255
You have the right
to beg for mercy.

126
00:06:13,339 --> 00:06:16,383
You have the right to request
judgment by combat Dwight's rights

127
00:06:16,801 --> 00:06:17,926
What's up, gangsters?

128
00:06:18,469 --> 00:06:20,762
Jim was lying
about jury duty

129
00:06:20,847 --> 00:06:24,182
He was lying the whole time so he
could go do yoga or go canoeing,

130
00:06:24,267 --> 00:06:26,768
I don't know what this pervert likes.
Fire him!

131
00:06:27,353 --> 00:06:29,938
Dwight, not everything
is a conspiracy theory

132
00:06:30,273 --> 00:06:33,483
saying that the victim...

133
00:06:33,568 --> 00:06:35,694
Dwight I have me on the record

134
00:06:35,778 --> 00:06:38,905
saying to you take a
chill pill all right?

135
00:06:39,198 --> 00:06:40,532
I don't need to
take a chill pill

136
00:06:40,867 --> 00:06:41,867
Here, right there

137
00:06:45,705 --> 00:06:46,955
Down the hatch

138
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:49,833
I really don't want
to take a chill pill.

139
00:06:50,168 --> 00:06:53,503
That a boy, good
Now, chill.

140
00:06:53,588 --> 00:06:54,588
Okay, okay

141
00:06:57,550 --> 00:07:01,261
But let's just say that Jim
was lying about jury duty

142
00:07:01,345 --> 00:07:02,929
you would have to
fire him, right?

143
00:07:03,723 --> 00:07:06,641
Yeah, sure. Of course.
I'd fire him to Timbuktu

144
00:07:06,726 --> 00:07:07,809
Ha-ha

145
00:07:09,479 --> 00:07:11,229
Good enough for me

146
00:07:12,398 --> 00:07:13,440
Ah

147
00:07:16,819 --> 00:07:19,488
And Pam was just going crazy
trying to take care of Philip

148
00:07:19,572 --> 00:07:21,907
because Cece has been
out of control recently.

149
00:07:23,034 --> 00:07:26,661
Look, Andy, it doesn't matter The truth
is I just feel terrible lying to you.

150
00:07:26,746 --> 00:07:29,080
Getting lied to

151
00:07:29,790 --> 00:07:31,416
No one's ever
lied to me before

152
00:07:33,419 --> 00:07:34,503
Okay

153
00:07:34,587 --> 00:07:36,421
I think the best
thing to do right now

154
00:07:36,506 --> 00:07:38,298
is just come clean
and tell everybody

155
00:07:38,382 --> 00:07:41,176
No. Not after what I told
Dwight about firing you. No

156
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:42,260
Here's what
we're going to do

157
00:07:42,970 --> 00:07:44,930
We're going to have ourselves
a good old fashioned cover-up

158
00:07:45,932 --> 00:07:48,308
You ever heard of a
Connecticut cover up? No

159
00:07:48,518 --> 00:07:50,393
You know why you
never heard of it?

160
00:07:50,478 --> 00:07:51,520
Covered it up

161
00:07:52,772 --> 00:07:54,564
Are you sure you can
keep this under wraps?

162
00:07:54,649 --> 00:07:56,483
They used to
call me King Tut

163
00:07:56,567 --> 00:07:59,152
because I'm so good at
keeping things under wraps

164
00:07:59,362 --> 00:08:01,905
My nickname was
actually King Butt

165
00:08:01,989 --> 00:08:03,740
because I had
a king-sized butt

166
00:08:12,667 --> 00:08:13,792
Where do you
want it parked?

167
00:08:15,294 --> 00:08:18,713
Okay, everybody
Gather round.

168
00:08:18,798 --> 00:08:20,840
Got a real special
surprise for you

169
00:08:20,925 --> 00:08:22,133
Ernesto

170
00:08:22,468 --> 00:08:23,843
Hola, Toby!

171
00:08:31,477 --> 00:08:34,187
Uh, I'm going to say "I"
when I'm talking for Ernesto

172
00:08:34,272 --> 00:08:36,523
so instead of,
"He says blah, blah, blah, '

173
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:39,484
I'm going to say, "I say blah,
blah, blah, ' but that's for him.

174
00:08:39,986 --> 00:08:43,446
Anyway, it was something
like he remembers Toby.

175
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,282
"I remember Toby.'

176
00:08:46,075 --> 00:08:49,786
Oh, Jim. Hey, this
guy look familiar?

177
00:08:50,246 --> 00:08:51,413
It's the empanada guy

178
00:08:51,497 --> 00:08:52,622
The empanada guy

179
00:08:52,707 --> 00:08:56,167
Holy *. Damn it, Toby
No, I wasn't asking you.

180
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:58,795
Ask him if he
remembers Jim

181
00:09:03,759 --> 00:09:04,801
No

182
00:09:05,177 --> 00:09:06,219
He says no

183
00:09:06,304 --> 00:09:07,554
He says no. Boom

184
00:09:07,638 --> 00:09:09,180
Yeah, but who remembers
all their customers?

185
00:09:09,265 --> 00:09:11,391
I mean, I can name
like three of our clients

186
00:09:11,475 --> 00:09:14,519
He remembers Toby the most
forgettable man in the known world

187
00:09:18,858 --> 00:09:20,734
He doesn't want
any trouble.

188
00:09:20,818 --> 00:09:22,402
He sees lots of people

189
00:09:22,486 --> 00:09:25,322
they come from all around to eat
his delicious meat pockets.

190
00:09:25,406 --> 00:09:29,534
Uh, you guys are going to love
these, so empanadas on me

191
00:09:29,619 --> 00:09:30,619
You guys got to try them

192
00:09:30,703 --> 00:09:34,956
Usually I'm a burrito guy but if you
won't tell, I won't. Wink, wink.

193
00:09:35,124 --> 00:09:37,834
Great And while we're enjoying
these delicious empanadas

194
00:09:37,918 --> 00:09:40,211
Jim, why don't you
tell us your story again?

195
00:09:40,296 --> 00:09:41,379
Why? Everybody's heard it

196
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:43,173
Walk us through it

197
00:09:43,257 --> 00:09:44,716
What time would you get
there every morning?

198
00:09:45,217 --> 00:09:46,801
Hey, Murder, She Wrote,

199
00:09:46,886 --> 00:09:50,430
how about we drop the whole
Murder, She Wrote thing, okay?

200
00:09:50,598 --> 00:09:53,475
Jim was at the courthouse
for jury duty every morning

201
00:09:53,559 --> 00:09:56,227
How do I know?
Because I drove him there

202
00:09:56,979 --> 00:09:58,813
Why?
Why?

203
00:09:59,398 --> 00:10:00,440
Why?

204
00:10:02,151 --> 00:10:03,735
Because my car broke down

205
00:10:04,362 --> 00:10:05,820
His car broke down
so he called me

206
00:10:05,905 --> 00:10:06,988
because I live
near the courthouse

207
00:10:07,073 --> 00:10:10,033
Wait, wait,
you live by the courthouse

208
00:10:10,117 --> 00:10:13,495
You drove from near the
courthouse out to Jim's house

209
00:10:13,579 --> 00:10:15,038
and then back to
the courthouse?

210
00:10:15,122 --> 00:10:17,666
Thirty minutes out 30
minutes back easy hour.

211
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:19,542
And I would watch
that cute, little tooshy

212
00:10:19,627 --> 00:10:21,878
scurry up those courthouse
stairs every morning

213
00:10:21,962 --> 00:10:23,630
and that was that

214
00:10:24,173 --> 00:10:28,093
I'm sorry, do you have
any American Mexican food?

215
00:10:28,678 --> 00:10:30,345
We're getting
buried out there

216
00:10:30,429 --> 00:10:32,055
What was that stuff about
the car breaking down?

217
00:10:32,139 --> 00:10:33,932
Well, I think you
handled it pretty well

218
00:10:34,058 --> 00:10:37,477
I'm not Rumpelstiltskin, Jim, I can't
keep spinning gold out of your ♪

219
00:10:37,603 --> 00:10:39,187
Okay, listen, all right?

220
00:10:39,271 --> 00:10:41,481
Dwight's onto us. He's going
to figure it out really soon

221
00:10:41,565 --> 00:10:43,400
So let's just get ahead of it.
Let's tell the truth

222
00:10:44,527 --> 00:10:46,528
I don't even know what
the truth is anymore.

223
00:10:47,321 --> 00:10:48,863
Wow, it's so

224
00:10:49,657 --> 00:10:50,865
healthy

225
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:53,493
I'm going to call
him Little Kevin

226
00:10:53,577 --> 00:10:54,953
No, you will not

227
00:10:55,037 --> 00:10:58,373
Is he really five pounds? Because
I squat with five pounds

228
00:10:58,916 --> 00:10:59,999
This

229
00:11:00,501 --> 00:11:02,419
Yeah, this feels like
more than that

230
00:11:02,503 --> 00:11:05,130
No, no, no he's nine
pounds seven ounces.

231
00:11:06,090 --> 00:11:07,966
Nine pounds? Really?

232
00:11:08,467 --> 00:11:11,886
I thought you said five You know what?
I was under so many drugs

233
00:11:11,971 --> 00:11:15,682
a James Taylor concert
or something

234
00:11:16,809 --> 00:11:17,851
So, what did you bring?

235
00:11:17,935 --> 00:11:21,020
Oh, yeah, I don't know
if it's right, but...

236
00:11:21,105 --> 00:11:24,399
Well, if it's anything like
that gorgeous wrapping paper

237
00:11:24,483 --> 00:11:25,567
you hit it
out of the park

238
00:11:26,861 --> 00:11:27,944
Oh

239
00:11:28,154 --> 00:11:29,779
Preemie pajamas

240
00:11:29,864 --> 00:11:31,573
Again, it may not be
the right size, I can

241
00:11:31,657 --> 00:11:35,034
No, I think he came early
just so he could wear these

242
00:11:35,244 --> 00:11:36,244
Thank you

243
00:11:36,328 --> 00:11:38,747
Call of Duty.

244
00:11:38,831 --> 00:11:41,291
This baby is
clearly not premature

245
00:11:41,375 --> 00:11:43,251
They're lying about
the date it was conceived

246
00:11:43,335 --> 00:11:45,211
It's very interesting

247
00:11:45,337 --> 00:11:49,382
And her husband's gay I don't
even know which thread to follow.

248
00:11:57,349 --> 00:12:00,727
Uh, excuse me, can I have
everyone's attention for a second?

249
00:12:00,936 --> 00:12:02,562
First off, I just want to
say that I'm really sorry

250
00:12:02,646 --> 00:12:04,439
I didn't know that
my absence last week

251
00:12:04,523 --> 00:12:06,274
would have been
a burden on any of you

252
00:12:06,358 --> 00:12:09,444
Because, though I did
have jury duty last week,

253
00:12:09,945 --> 00:12:13,031
they did dismiss me
early on Monday.

254
00:12:14,617 --> 00:12:16,868
And I think you're going to
find this pretty hilarious.

255
00:12:16,952 --> 00:12:20,914
I kind of, well
maybe took the week off

256
00:12:22,333 --> 00:12:23,291
What?

257
00:12:23,375 --> 00:12:25,418
Funny? No? Nobody laughed

258
00:12:26,962 --> 00:12:28,505
You're screwed

259
00:12:29,298 --> 00:12:32,509
Oh! It's happening.
It's really happening

260
00:12:32,593 --> 00:12:35,345
What the hell, Jim I
covered for your bony butt

261
00:12:35,429 --> 00:12:37,639
Pam really needed some help
with the kids, so...

262
00:12:37,723 --> 00:12:39,224
I promise my
intentions were good

263
00:12:39,308 --> 00:12:40,934
Your clients,
they're all mine

264
00:12:41,018 --> 00:12:45,355
Jim, I got my ass chewed out because
one of your orders got messed up.

265
00:12:45,773 --> 00:12:47,816
And Andy, you said you drove
him to the courthouse

266
00:12:47,942 --> 00:12:49,108
Uh, I did

267
00:12:50,236 --> 00:12:53,238
Every morning And if I
didn't then I hope I die

268
00:12:53,572 --> 00:12:58,076
All right, well, let's get this
show on the road, shall we?

269
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:01,079
Allow me to give you
a hand Here we are.

270
00:13:01,163 --> 00:13:03,289
So long, clump mate

271
00:13:03,999 --> 00:13:05,625
I'm going to miss you
Truth be told,

272
00:13:05,709 --> 00:13:08,378
I never thought that this
was how it was going to end

273
00:13:08,462 --> 00:13:10,505
I was going to
defeat you somehow

274
00:13:10,589 --> 00:13:11,714
but you've
defeated yourself

275
00:13:12,466 --> 00:13:14,926
Dwight, cut it out
I'm not firing Jim.

276
00:13:15,052 --> 00:13:16,678
No, no, no, no
you said...

277
00:13:16,762 --> 00:13:18,513
ANDY
I know what I said

278
00:13:18,597 --> 00:13:22,684
Jim, you're in deep
doo-doo you understand?

279
00:13:22,768 --> 00:13:24,060
And I have one
thing to say to you

280
00:13:24,144 --> 00:13:26,354
and I'm going to say it in
front of this whole office

281
00:13:26,438 --> 00:13:27,772
Look me in the eye

282
00:13:31,443 --> 00:13:32,527
That's it?

283
00:13:33,904 --> 00:13:35,363
This is crap

284
00:13:37,908 --> 00:13:40,118
You've reached Gabe Lewis.
I'm currently indisposed.

285
00:13:40,202 --> 00:13:42,120
Leave me a message. Ciao.

286
00:13:42,204 --> 00:13:43,371
Gabe, it's Dwight again

287
00:13:43,455 --> 00:13:45,540
Highest priority
triple urgent.

288
00:13:45,624 --> 00:13:48,209
Call me immediately
That means ASAP

289
00:13:48,878 --> 00:13:50,712
I'm going to find Gabe
tell him what Jim did

290
00:13:50,796 --> 00:13:53,798
and let the little stickler
do what he does best, stickle

291
00:13:54,925 --> 00:13:57,468
Honestly, I can return
this for a larger size

292
00:13:57,678 --> 00:14:00,471
It's fine Pajamas aren't
supposed to be baggy, right?

293
00:14:00,556 --> 00:14:01,806
It's not the barrio

294
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:06,644
The only premature baby in this
room is the baby this baby ate

295
00:14:09,398 --> 00:14:10,857
Little Kevin

296
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:12,775
Really?
Angela

297
00:14:12,985 --> 00:14:14,319
Fine. God

298
00:14:15,070 --> 00:14:16,946
Philip was conceived
nine months ago.

299
00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:20,867
The Senator and I
wanted to wait

300
00:14:21,410 --> 00:14:23,244
but we had just seen Thor,

301
00:14:23,329 --> 00:14:25,747
and there was way too much
wine in my chicken piccata

302
00:14:25,831 --> 00:14:27,582
Chicken marsala
Right

303
00:14:27,666 --> 00:14:31,252
And, the point is, Philip was
conceived out of wedlock

304
00:14:31,337 --> 00:14:32,420
Hmm

305
00:14:32,546 --> 00:14:35,757
And now you all know
but you can never tell

306
00:14:36,216 --> 00:14:37,634
I'm serious

307
00:14:39,303 --> 00:14:40,511
Dwight

308
00:14:40,721 --> 00:14:41,721
Hey

309
00:14:41,847 --> 00:14:42,889
Oh. Hey, have you
seen Gabe?

310
00:14:42,973 --> 00:14:45,141
He went to the car or
something but he'll be back.

311
00:14:45,517 --> 00:14:46,517
Okay

312
00:14:49,688 --> 00:14:50,939
Don't you want
to see the baby?

313
00:14:51,607 --> 00:14:54,359
Why? I know what Angela
and the Senator look like

314
00:14:54,443 --> 00:14:56,778
I can mash that up
in my head right now

315
00:14:59,782 --> 00:15:01,115
wouldn't tell

316
00:15:01,367 --> 00:15:02,408
So don't

317
00:15:02,952 --> 00:15:06,120
Angela got pregnant
before the wedding.

318
00:15:08,332 --> 00:15:09,415
What?

319
00:15:09,667 --> 00:15:10,792
She got pregnant
before the wedding

320
00:15:10,876 --> 00:15:12,543
How long before?
A month

321
00:15:19,176 --> 00:15:20,343
You didn't hear it
from me

322
00:15:20,427 --> 00:15:21,803
Yes, I did

323
00:15:26,725 --> 00:15:28,101
Dwight?
Dwight.

324
00:15:29,311 --> 00:15:32,230
Well, Angela will make you cut
your fingernails It's not worth it

325
00:15:33,065 --> 00:15:34,148
Oh

326
00:15:34,566 --> 00:15:35,650
Yes

327
00:15:36,485 --> 00:15:37,568
Oh

328
00:15:37,778 --> 00:15:42,532
What a beautiful child Prominent
forehead, short arms, tiny nose.

329
00:15:44,034 --> 00:15:45,910
You will lead millions

330
00:15:46,578 --> 00:15:48,913
willingly or as slaves

331
00:15:49,289 --> 00:15:53,418
That baby is a Schrute, and
unless somebody taught Mose sex

332
00:15:53,752 --> 00:15:55,420
that baby is mine

333
00:15:57,006 --> 00:15:58,339
He's hungry

334
00:15:58,424 --> 00:16:00,508
Oh, that's my cue
to leave.

335
00:16:00,592 --> 00:16:02,301
No, you don't have to I'm
going to wear this cover.

336
00:16:02,386 --> 00:16:05,304
Still

337
00:16:05,389 --> 00:16:06,514
You won't be seeing

338
00:16:08,934 --> 00:16:09,934
Do you want the giraffe?

339
00:16:10,019 --> 00:16:12,937
Yes, I am bringing my kids in to
help me get out of this hole.

340
00:16:13,022 --> 00:16:14,772
And you all remember
my beautiful wife, Pam

341
00:16:14,857 --> 00:16:15,898
Hi

342
00:16:16,775 --> 00:16:18,860
Wow, I really thought I'd
be more excited to be here

343
00:16:18,944 --> 00:16:20,737
Whoa, whoa, whoa Game face, baby.
Game face

344
00:16:20,821 --> 00:16:21,863
Oh, right. Okay

345
00:16:21,947 --> 00:16:23,656
Hey, Stanley
it's great to see you

346
00:16:23,741 --> 00:16:24,699
No, that's overdoing it I think.

347
00:16:24,783 --> 00:16:26,868
Hi, Stanley.
Split the difference

348
00:16:26,952 --> 00:16:28,619
Jim.
Okay. Let's go

349
00:16:29,038 --> 00:16:30,079
Hi

350
00:16:31,415 --> 00:16:32,874
Hi, everybody

351
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:34,542
What?
Oh, hi

352
00:16:34,626 --> 00:16:36,002
How about
a little visit?

353
00:16:36,086 --> 00:16:39,047
Wow. What a surprise
That's crazy

354
00:16:39,131 --> 00:16:41,049
You guys get to meet
the little heck raisers

355
00:16:41,133 --> 00:16:42,800
Hey, Angela's back
with her baby.

356
00:16:42,885 --> 00:16:44,552
Yes, well, you guys
all know Cece,

357
00:16:44,636 --> 00:16:46,637
but we wanted to introduce
you to baby Philip.

358
00:16:49,475 --> 00:16:50,767
You guys

359
00:16:53,145 --> 00:16:55,063
He's licking on my finger
just like my cat does.

360
00:16:55,147 --> 00:16:56,272
Let me have a turn

361
00:16:56,356 --> 00:16:57,398
No, it's
the pacifier's turn

362
00:16:57,483 --> 00:16:58,524
All right

363
00:16:58,609 --> 00:17:00,234
Did you say
something about

364
00:17:00,319 --> 00:17:03,488
this one bringing in
something for these people?

365
00:17:03,572 --> 00:17:06,741
Yes. Cece wanted
to thank everybody

366
00:17:06,867 --> 00:17:10,286
for letting her daddy stay home
with her all last week and play

367
00:17:10,370 --> 00:17:11,954
so she brought
you a little treat

368
00:17:12,039 --> 00:17:13,206
Oh, cookies?

369
00:17:13,290 --> 00:17:14,832
No. But that would have
been a really good idea

370
00:17:14,917 --> 00:17:15,917
That would have
been really good

371
00:17:16,001 --> 00:17:18,669
No, she
brought you drawings

372
00:17:18,879 --> 00:17:21,255
Oh, my goodness,
let's take a look at these

373
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:25,968
They're usually amazing so let's see.
Yep, they are

374
00:17:26,053 --> 00:17:27,428
Uncle Andy

375
00:17:27,513 --> 00:17:28,554
Oh

376
00:17:28,639 --> 00:17:29,889
Aunt Phyllis

377
00:17:29,973 --> 00:17:33,142
Wow. These are incredible
Cece, did you do these?

378
00:17:33,227 --> 00:17:34,268
No

379
00:17:34,353 --> 00:17:38,022
She says no to everything. You
know, she thinks my name is "No.'

380
00:17:38,107 --> 00:17:39,941
Cece, do you want
some broccoli?

381
00:17:40,025 --> 00:17:41,025
Yes

382
00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:42,110
No

383
00:17:42,861 --> 00:17:43,986
It's crazy

384
00:17:44,071 --> 00:17:46,697
Why am I shorter than the table
that I'm standing next to?

385
00:17:47,491 --> 00:17:49,867
ANDY There is crosshatching
in some of these

386
00:17:49,952 --> 00:17:51,786
That's kind of advanced
for a 2-year-old.

387
00:17:51,870 --> 00:17:54,497
Cece, this is your
big sister, Kelly

388
00:17:55,165 --> 00:17:56,457
Did you color
this pretty picture?

389
00:17:56,542 --> 00:17:57,583
No

390
00:17:57,709 --> 00:17:59,877
So then this
means nothing to you?

391
00:18:01,421 --> 00:18:02,713
Hey, Cece

392
00:18:03,090 --> 00:18:07,510
why don't you draw another picture
for us exactly like this one

393
00:18:07,970 --> 00:18:10,638
or at least in
the exact same style?

394
00:18:10,806 --> 00:18:13,891
You know what? I don't think you
need to do things on command.

395
00:18:13,976 --> 00:18:16,811
That's very weird Just take that.
Thank you.

396
00:18:16,895 --> 00:18:20,064
I think we should just wrap
up the show kiddos, right?

397
00:18:20,691 --> 00:18:22,358
Else we can do here

398
00:18:23,569 --> 00:18:24,819
Okay. All right

399
00:18:24,903 --> 00:18:26,612
It's okay, sweetie
All right

400
00:18:26,697 --> 00:18:28,322
All right. Okay

401
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:32,743
It's okay

402
00:18:32,995 --> 00:18:34,537
Shh

403
00:18:36,874 --> 00:18:41,169
Angela, this child is definitely mine.
He looks just like me

404
00:18:41,253 --> 00:18:42,962
Every baby
looks just like you

405
00:18:43,046 --> 00:18:44,422
Your face kind of
looks like a baby

406
00:18:44,506 --> 00:18:49,010
Need I remind you that we were
together a month before the wedding?

407
00:18:49,094 --> 00:18:51,179
That is completely untrue

408
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:52,263
Completely true

409
00:18:52,347 --> 00:18:53,347
No
Remember?

410
00:18:53,432 --> 00:18:55,308
You said that Robert
was not fulfilling you

411
00:18:55,392 --> 00:18:56,726
And I said that I
could fulfill you

412
00:18:56,810 --> 00:18:58,102
and you said
"I'd like to see you try.'

413
00:18:58,187 --> 00:19:00,354
And then I kissed you with the
force of a thousand waterfalls

414
00:19:00,439 --> 00:19:01,772
That didn't happen

415
00:19:01,857 --> 00:19:03,441
Then I inserted my
penis into your...

416
00:19:03,525 --> 00:19:05,067
No! Stop it! Dwight

417
00:19:05,152 --> 00:19:06,277
vagina and

418
00:19:06,361 --> 00:19:07,570
And even if it did,
it's just a coincidence

419
00:19:07,654 --> 00:19:09,197
Admit that there is a chance.
I will not

420
00:19:09,281 --> 00:19:10,323
Admit it
I will not

421
00:19:10,324 --> 00:19:11,324
It's not

422
00:19:12,117 --> 00:19:13,618
All done?
Yes

423
00:19:13,702 --> 00:19:15,286
Yes. He's sleeping

424
00:19:15,370 --> 00:19:17,121
Before I go, may I?

425
00:19:17,497 --> 00:19:18,623
Sure

426
00:19:19,583 --> 00:19:21,876
Watch the head
Watch the head

427
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:33,638
Nurse! You know that baby in there?
Baby Philip?

428
00:19:33,722 --> 00:19:35,181
Cancel the circumcision

429
00:19:35,265 --> 00:19:36,265
Who are you?

430
00:19:41,605 --> 00:19:43,814
What that means

431
00:19:44,358 --> 00:19:46,484
We're going to
circumcise him

432
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:49,904
Cece, want to come?

433
00:19:49,988 --> 00:19:50,947
No

434
00:19:51,031 --> 00:19:52,573
Want to come play?
Oh, bud, I know.

435
00:19:52,658 --> 00:19:53,616
Do you have a pacifier?

436
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:55,660
Yeah. I'm looking I'm
looking for the pacifier.

437
00:19:56,203 --> 00:19:57,745
Cece
Okay, we're going

438
00:19:57,829 --> 00:20:00,164
We got to go All right,
we're going home

439
00:20:01,833 --> 00:20:04,001
I know

440
00:20:05,837 --> 00:20:07,880
You gotta grab her
I'll go grab her. Okay

441
00:20:07,965 --> 00:20:10,299
Okay. Here we go
Here we go.

442
00:20:10,425 --> 00:20:12,802
Okay, I'm just going to go down to
the car, and I'm going to put her

443
00:20:12,886 --> 00:20:14,679
in her seat and
I'll be right back up

444
00:20:16,348 --> 00:20:17,598
We'll see you tomorrow

445
00:20:17,683 --> 00:20:18,808
No, no, it's okay
I'll be right back.

446
00:20:18,892 --> 00:20:19,976
No, just go home

447
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:22,103
It's all good
We got this.

448
00:20:23,939 --> 00:20:25,815
Last week
Jim at home

449
00:20:27,234 --> 00:20:29,026
that was no vacation

450
00:20:29,444 --> 00:20:30,611
Jim, just go

451
00:20:30,696 --> 00:20:32,655
Hey, we'll be just fine

452
00:20:34,533 --> 00:20:35,950
Thanks, guys

453
00:20:36,368 --> 00:20:38,703
All right, here we go
Let's go

454
00:20:39,579 --> 00:20:41,205
Oh!

455
00:20:41,373 --> 00:20:42,498
Phew

456
00:20:52,968 --> 00:20:54,093
Dwight, what the hell?

457
00:20:55,262 --> 00:20:56,762
You can't smoke in here

458
00:20:56,847 --> 00:20:58,347
Oh, all right

459
00:20:59,266 --> 00:21:00,308
Ah

460
00:21:00,392 --> 00:21:02,685
The office looks
different now Mmm

461
00:21:02,894 --> 00:21:04,103
Smaller

462
00:21:04,771 --> 00:21:06,772
Maybe I just feel bigger

463
00:21:07,107 --> 00:21:08,149
Hello, Gabe

464
00:21:08,233 --> 00:21:09,358
You had something
important to tell me?

465
00:21:10,235 --> 00:21:14,572
Oh. You know, I did but now it
seems infinitely insignificant

466
00:21:15,282 --> 00:21:18,951
Jim? Oh, right
No, forget it.

467
00:21:19,036 --> 00:21:21,537
He was doing it for
his kids I get it

468
00:21:21,747 --> 00:21:24,165
Kids drive us dads crazy.

469
00:21:24,249 --> 00:21:25,958
Sometimes I feel
like they're raising us.

470
00:21:26,293 --> 00:21:27,668
Am I right?
