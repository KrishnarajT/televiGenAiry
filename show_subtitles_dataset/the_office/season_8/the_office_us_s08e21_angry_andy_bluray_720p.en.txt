1
00:00:01,674 --> 00:00:05,469
Phew! Wow. It is raining
cats and dogs out there.

2
00:00:05,929 --> 00:00:07,304
Holy moly

3
00:00:07,388 --> 00:00:10,641
Phyllis says the same 12
clichÃ©s every time it rains.

4
00:00:10,725 --> 00:00:14,645
So, I promised everyone that if
she says them all by noon today,

5
00:00:14,729 --> 00:00:17,189
I will send out
for hot chocolates

6
00:00:17,565 --> 00:00:18,690
So how was the drive in?

7
00:00:18,817 --> 00:00:20,609
Nobody knows how to
drive in the rain.

8
00:00:20,693 --> 00:00:22,027
You don't say?
Yeah.

9
00:00:22,153 --> 00:00:25,531
You know the roads are actually the
slickest in the first half hour?

10
00:00:26,991 --> 00:00:30,077
I think it's the oil, it comes to the surface.
- I agree

11
00:00:31,037 --> 00:00:34,623
Ooh! The plants are
gonna love this. Yeah

12
00:00:39,754 --> 00:00:42,131
PHYLLIS I actually sleep
better when it's raining

13
00:00:42,215 --> 00:00:43,382
Tell me about it

14
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:46,468
Time's almost up. How many are left?
Just one.

15
00:00:46,553 --> 00:00:49,555
"This weather makes me want to stay
at home, curled up with a good book.'

16
00:00:51,391 --> 00:00:55,185
Phyllis, this rain, does it make
you want to be doing something?

17
00:00:55,395 --> 00:00:56,854
What do you mean?

18
00:00:56,938 --> 00:01:00,440
You know, like, aren't some things
just so nice and cozy in the rain?

19
00:01:00,525 --> 00:01:03,110
Hey, come on Lots of things
are cozy in the rain.

20
00:01:04,737 --> 00:01:06,822
And that's noon
Exactly!

21
00:01:07,907 --> 00:01:09,658
Sorry about that
everybody.

22
00:01:10,910 --> 00:01:13,036
Hey, Phyllis would you
like a hot chocolate?

23
00:01:13,121 --> 00:01:14,163
Ooh, I'd love one

24
00:01:14,247 --> 00:01:16,748
I'm going out to get
two hot chocolates

25
00:01:21,004 --> 00:01:23,297
the rain would make me
want to stay at home,

26
00:01:23,381 --> 00:01:24,715
curled up with
a good book

27
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:27,301
but everybody's being
so nice to me today.

28
00:01:27,385 --> 00:01:28,927
I'm really happy
being here

29
00:01:53,745 --> 00:01:57,039
My girlfriend's back and
there's going to be trouble

30
00:01:57,123 --> 00:01:58,832
Hey, la, hey, la,
his girlfriend's back

31
00:01:58,917 --> 00:02:00,876
Hey, la, hey, la,
my girlfriend's back

32
00:02:02,170 --> 00:02:04,087
A month ago, I walked
out of this office

33
00:02:04,172 --> 00:02:05,923
positive I was
never coming back

34
00:02:07,467 --> 00:02:08,884
I probably shouldn't
have emailed everyone

35
00:02:08,968 --> 00:02:11,053
telling them exactly
what I thought of them

36
00:02:11,304 --> 00:02:13,180
Hey, Erin, thank you
for the nice email.

37
00:02:14,057 --> 00:02:17,184
Yeah. I don't get emotional
a lot but that was...

38
00:02:18,561 --> 00:02:19,937
I'm just glad to know I had an impact

39
00:02:22,899 --> 00:02:26,610
In other news Erin and
Andy are back together

40
00:02:27,278 --> 00:02:29,238
Crazy story
Yes

41
00:02:29,322 --> 00:02:32,241
down to Florida,
she was not expecting it

42
00:02:32,325 --> 00:02:34,159
totally swept her off her feet.
Right? Yeah.

43
00:02:34,327 --> 00:02:35,327
How long
was the drive?

44
00:02:35,578 --> 00:02:37,079
It's like a day and
a half each way.

45
00:02:37,163 --> 00:02:40,540
But when I got there, I went right
up to the house, and I was like

46
00:02:40,667 --> 00:02:43,585
Day and a half? My lumbar
would be killing me.

47
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:47,464
You should get this lumbar
support cushion thing my dad has

48
00:02:47,548 --> 00:02:48,840
What's it called?
Um

49
00:02:49,842 --> 00:02:51,218
Not Easy-Rest

50
00:02:51,511 --> 00:02:53,428
That gas must've cost
a pretty penny, huh?

51
00:02:53,513 --> 00:02:54,721
Well
he's got a Prius

52
00:02:54,847 --> 00:02:56,139
How many times you fill the tank?
Three, four?

53
00:02:56,349 --> 00:02:58,267
What does gas
cost down there?

54
00:02:58,351 --> 00:03:00,435
Lumbar Buddy
Lumbar Buddy

55
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,645
Oh, yeah
Lumbar Buddy.

56
00:03:01,729 --> 00:03:03,563
Tell you what,
I'll email you the story

57
00:03:03,648 --> 00:03:05,232
It's a real
tearjerker, though

58
00:03:05,316 --> 00:03:06,858
So read with caution

59
00:03:07,193 --> 00:03:08,443
Anyway, I know it's
the end of the day.

60
00:03:08,528 --> 00:03:09,903
We just wanted to
stop by and say hi

61
00:03:09,988 --> 00:03:12,489
And then later on, we have
a reservation at Patsel's.

62
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:14,866
Miss Lumbar

63
00:03:15,743 --> 00:03:17,327
Hey, Kev
Yeah.

64
00:03:17,495 --> 00:03:20,038
Nice sweater
Thank you

65
00:03:20,623 --> 00:03:23,208
Nellie was nice enough
to give it to me

66
00:03:23,793 --> 00:03:26,795
She's sweet I just
wish there was pockets

67
00:03:28,589 --> 00:03:30,299
What happened
to Old Salty?

68
00:03:30,383 --> 00:03:31,883
Nellie let me
bobble-ize him

69
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:34,177
His name is now
Captain Mutato.

70
00:03:35,221 --> 00:03:37,014
I've written quite a bit
of X-Men fan fiction.

71
00:03:37,098 --> 00:03:39,850
Captain Mutato is
half-man, half-mermaid

72
00:03:39,934 --> 00:03:42,019
So he can fight
crime as a man

73
00:03:42,103 --> 00:03:43,729
and make love
as a mermaid.

74
00:03:44,689 --> 00:03:47,357
Most of my writing
involves the latter

75
00:03:53,072 --> 00:03:54,072
Okey-doke

76
00:03:56,993 --> 00:03:58,076
Yes?

77
00:04:00,330 --> 00:04:01,330
Whoa

78
00:04:03,416 --> 00:04:06,960
Well, you must be the famous Nellie
Bertram I've been hearing all about

79
00:04:07,086 --> 00:04:10,630
I am the famous Andy Bernard you
have been hearing all about.

80
00:04:10,757 --> 00:04:12,507
Oh, yes I just want to thank you

81
00:04:12,592 --> 00:04:15,510
for jumping in and
minding the store

82
00:04:15,595 --> 00:04:16,970
during my temporary absence

83
00:04:17,138 --> 00:04:19,348
You are most welcome

84
00:04:19,557 --> 00:04:22,768
Anyway, now that I'm back I would
love to have my office back,

85
00:04:22,852 --> 00:04:24,895
whenever you get a chance. No

86
00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:30,025
Obviously we'll figure
out the logistics

87
00:04:30,109 --> 00:04:32,527
of moving all of this
stuff out of here.

88
00:04:33,196 --> 00:04:36,656
But, you know the sooner the
better Get back to normalcy

89
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:38,033
Mmm. No

90
00:04:42,330 --> 00:04:43,330
Thank you

91
00:04:44,624 --> 00:04:45,624
Okay

92
00:04:45,708 --> 00:04:46,792
Wait. Uh

93
00:04:47,043 --> 00:04:50,045
When I showed up here
there was no manager

94
00:04:50,129 --> 00:04:52,172
It's like when the Americans
showed up at the Moon

95
00:04:52,256 --> 00:04:53,548
Nobody was there

96
00:04:53,633 --> 00:04:55,133
So they planted
their flag,

97
00:04:55,218 --> 00:04:56,843
and it's their
moon now, isn't it?

98
00:04:57,387 --> 00:05:01,014
Nobody likes it but it's
America's bloody moon

99
00:05:01,599 --> 00:05:04,434
Just lay him in his crib
and then bicycle his legs

100
00:05:04,519 --> 00:05:05,769
And then after
Jim quiets down

101
00:05:05,853 --> 00:05:07,229
you do the same thing
with your baby.

102
00:05:09,232 --> 00:05:11,024
But if he keeps having
problems, just give me a call

103
00:05:11,109 --> 00:05:12,567
Oh, my gosh
thank you so much

104
00:05:12,652 --> 00:05:13,860
But seriously, we don't
want to bother you

105
00:05:13,986 --> 00:05:15,153
any more than we already have.
That's it

106
00:05:15,613 --> 00:05:17,030
It's no bother.
You guys are our friends

107
00:05:17,407 --> 00:05:19,157
Ravi, our amazing
paediatrician,

108
00:05:19,242 --> 00:05:21,410
was asking us if
we knew any girls

109
00:05:21,494 --> 00:05:24,037
and I said, "I know
the perfect girl.'

110
00:05:24,122 --> 00:05:29,042
Yeah. Because Kelly is
Indian and Oh, that's it

111
00:05:30,294 --> 00:05:32,671
Race had nothing
to do with it.

112
00:05:32,755 --> 00:05:34,548
I just knew they'd
be good together

113
00:05:35,049 --> 00:05:36,049
Why?

114
00:05:36,134 --> 00:05:38,427
Kelly has been
a handful in the past.

115
00:05:38,511 --> 00:05:39,928
But she's had
a bad influence.

116
00:05:40,012 --> 00:05:43,014
She's like an addict, and I
just had to get her clean.

117
00:05:43,975 --> 00:05:44,933
Get lower

118
00:05:45,017 --> 00:05:47,519
Next, I'm going to set up
my sister with Darryl.

119
00:05:47,603 --> 00:05:49,020
Okay, we get it

120
00:05:49,021 --> 00:05:51,606
What? I think they'd be good together.
Really?

121
00:05:54,986 --> 00:05:57,779
Um, also, little tip,
never shake the baby

122
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:01,366
Sorry, just to be clear, you're
saying do not shake the baby?

123
00:06:01,451 --> 00:06:02,534
Don't shake the baby

124
00:06:02,618 --> 00:06:04,953
A lot of times parents get
frustrated because the baby's crying

125
00:06:05,037 --> 00:06:08,999
and they shake the baby
and you got to...

126
00:06:09,083 --> 00:06:10,083
You can't do that

127
00:06:10,293 --> 00:06:11,877
Don't shake our baby
Yeah.

128
00:06:11,961 --> 00:06:13,587
Okay, I'd never
heard that before

129
00:06:13,713 --> 00:06:14,671
Oh, my God
So, thank you

130
00:06:14,755 --> 00:06:16,756
Yeah, I'm glad you said
something Me, too.

131
00:06:17,633 --> 00:06:19,968
Kelly and I broke up and she
can do whatever she wants.

132
00:06:20,052 --> 00:06:22,179
And her new boyfriend
seems awesome,

133
00:06:22,263 --> 00:06:24,097
if you're into
Indian people

134
00:06:24,474 --> 00:06:25,724
I'm not

135
00:06:27,727 --> 00:06:29,144
And that's
when I realized

136
00:06:29,228 --> 00:06:31,104
if you're gonna put a
thermometer in one end,

137
00:06:31,189 --> 00:06:33,398
you'd better put a
lollipop in the other.

138
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:36,651
Hey, I'm sorry Is this a
workplace or a Starbucks?

139
00:06:36,736 --> 00:06:39,404
Because I was under the
impression it was a workplace.

140
00:06:39,489 --> 00:06:40,822
Maybe I'm
the crazy one

141
00:06:40,907 --> 00:06:43,074
No. No, we're sorry.
Come on, let's go, Ravi

142
00:06:43,159 --> 00:06:46,077
Also, since when do we have
guests here without clearance?

143
00:06:49,415 --> 00:06:50,415
Hey, um

144
00:06:51,209 --> 00:06:53,543
What's the deal with this guy?
He's really into Kelly, huh?

145
00:06:54,170 --> 00:06:55,754
Yeah, they're
really great together

146
00:06:56,088 --> 00:06:57,339
Makes me wonder
if I made a mistake

147
00:06:57,423 --> 00:07:00,634
No, no, no. Come on I think you
guys are both happier now, right?

148
00:07:00,718 --> 00:07:03,136
You're single. Plenty of
girls to date, right?

149
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:05,430
Yeah

150
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:08,683
Maybe we weren't right
together but it's weird

151
00:07:08,768 --> 00:07:12,354
I'd rather she be alone
than with somebody.

152
00:07:13,272 --> 00:07:14,272
Is that love?

153
00:07:17,109 --> 00:07:18,985
That's about it, yeah

154
00:07:21,364 --> 00:07:23,406
Well, Nellie picked up
the slack around here

155
00:07:23,491 --> 00:07:26,368
while you were trolling
the Florida beaches for ta

156
00:07:26,452 --> 00:07:28,453
like some college student
on spring break.

157
00:07:29,956 --> 00:07:31,915
I had to tell Erin
how I felt

158
00:07:31,999 --> 00:07:33,959
Andy, I appreciate
your romantic quest

159
00:07:34,043 --> 00:07:36,795
and in an age before the
telephone or Internet,

160
00:07:36,963 --> 00:07:39,172
or written language
that would be compelling

161
00:07:39,257 --> 00:07:41,716
But there are five six
devices in this room alone

162
00:07:41,801 --> 00:07:44,469
that would have let you tell her
that without ever going to Florida.

163
00:07:44,554 --> 00:07:47,347
We live in
amazing times

164
00:07:47,473 --> 00:07:49,516
Yeah, I know
I screwed up

165
00:07:50,434 --> 00:07:53,228
But I always do
whatever you ask of me

166
00:07:53,312 --> 00:07:55,605
and this will never
happen again.

167
00:07:55,982 --> 00:07:58,984
And if Erin decides she's made a
mistake and returns to Florida?

168
00:07:59,902 --> 00:08:03,655
At least she knows how I feel,
and I would not follow her.

169
00:08:06,450 --> 00:08:10,453
What if she were kidnapped by a
gang of Albanian human traffickers?

170
00:08:12,331 --> 00:08:13,540
Like in Taken?

171
00:08:13,791 --> 00:08:14,791
What?

172
00:08:15,167 --> 00:08:17,043
Yes, of course
if she's taken.

173
00:08:17,128 --> 00:08:19,254
That's what I'm talking
about By Albanians

174
00:08:19,839 --> 00:08:21,423
I would stay
in this office

175
00:08:22,508 --> 00:08:25,176
Wow, okay. I'll
remember you said that

176
00:08:31,517 --> 00:08:32,934
Nellie

177
00:08:34,395 --> 00:08:38,690
you've been terrific
in your interim capacity

178
00:08:38,816 --> 00:08:41,151
but Andrew is
the rightful manager

179
00:08:41,235 --> 00:08:44,029
so if you would just
give him his office

180
00:08:44,196 --> 00:08:46,072
No.
I'm sorry?

181
00:08:47,366 --> 00:08:50,035
This is what I was
trying to tell you.

182
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,538
I'm not accustomed to
people saying no to me

183
00:08:53,623 --> 00:08:56,583
Well, Bobby,
get accustomed to it

184
00:08:56,667 --> 00:09:02,047
because then it feels so good
when they finally say yes.

185
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:11,765
You're both adults
I'm sure you can

186
00:09:13,768 --> 00:09:16,519
figure this out
between yourselves

187
00:09:19,649 --> 00:09:23,818
desire to influence
a business decision

188
00:09:23,903 --> 00:09:28,281
So, I find it best to
recuse myself temporarily

189
00:09:28,366 --> 00:09:29,991
until I've had
a chance to make love

190
00:09:30,117 --> 00:09:34,829
and then go back and analyze
the situation rationally.

191
00:09:36,916 --> 00:09:39,626
Buffett operates
the same way.

192
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:44,172
I want to order the zebra
rug for my office,

193
00:09:44,256 --> 00:09:46,257
but can you dye it
entirely black?

194
00:09:48,094 --> 00:09:49,969
No, I still want it
to be a zebra.

195
00:09:51,347 --> 00:09:52,597
Well, I'll know

196
00:09:53,891 --> 00:09:55,934
Because they're
ridiculous creatures

197
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:57,519
They don't know
what they are.

198
00:09:57,603 --> 00:10:00,021
Phyllis says J. Duffy's
might be more our speed

199
00:10:00,106 --> 00:10:02,941
And if we want even the option
of drawing on the placemats...

200
00:10:05,236 --> 00:10:07,404
of an anger problem

201
00:10:08,239 --> 00:10:09,989
Got me in some trouble
a couple years ago.

202
00:10:10,074 --> 00:10:11,783
When I see him
start to get mad,

203
00:10:11,867 --> 00:10:15,412
on his arm like this

204
00:10:16,997 --> 00:10:19,916
It reminds me to just
check out and relax

205
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:24,963
There's also a lullaby they used to
sing to me when I was growing up.

206
00:10:26,507 --> 00:10:30,427
The state of Pennsylvania
is watching over you

207
00:10:30,845 --> 00:10:34,848
No need for parents,
the governor will do

208
00:10:35,141 --> 00:10:36,391
It's really nice

209
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:42,063
The General Assembly's
like a mom and a dad

210
00:10:46,318 --> 00:10:47,527
had

211
00:10:49,697 --> 00:10:52,449
about a trespasser

212
00:10:52,992 --> 00:10:55,201
Yes. Right this way

213
00:10:57,580 --> 00:11:02,083
Because they are idiots.
Big, stripy, horsey idiots

214
00:11:02,168 --> 00:11:04,377
What you don't... Hey

215
00:11:04,587 --> 00:11:06,921
Hank, please remove
Nellie from my office

216
00:11:07,214 --> 00:11:08,256
Hank, thank God
you're here.

217
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:10,675
This psychopath keeps
barging into my office

218
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:12,677
It's my office

219
00:11:14,054 --> 00:11:16,765
Well, she's sitting
there like a manager

220
00:11:17,850 --> 00:11:19,601
And you're standing
up here like me

221
00:11:20,644 --> 00:11:23,855
But maybe it's a little
more complicated than that

222
00:11:30,237 --> 00:11:31,988
I'm going to
count down from five

223
00:11:32,072 --> 00:11:34,115
and if you're not
out of my office

224
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:36,910
I'm going to
dock your pay $100

225
00:11:37,203 --> 00:11:39,370
Five, four

226
00:11:39,455 --> 00:11:40,830
You can't dock my pay

227
00:11:42,708 --> 00:11:44,626
Three, two, one

228
00:11:44,710 --> 00:11:46,920
Congratulations,
you just lost $100

229
00:11:47,254 --> 00:11:48,254
Really?

230
00:11:49,215 --> 00:11:53,510
Angela
dock Andy's pay $100

231
00:11:53,844 --> 00:11:55,011
On it

232
00:11:55,638 --> 00:11:59,724
Great Five, four,
three two, one.

233
00:12:00,684 --> 00:12:04,896
Angela, please dock
Nellie's pay $100.

234
00:12:08,442 --> 00:12:09,442
Hmm?

235
00:12:09,902 --> 00:12:11,694
Is she responding? Hmm

236
00:12:12,571 --> 00:12:14,739
Angela? Do you want to go again?

237
00:12:15,199 --> 00:12:16,741
Angela!
Let's go again

238
00:12:17,368 --> 00:12:19,577
Five, four, three
two, one.

239
00:12:19,662 --> 00:12:22,789
Oh, she's counting again
Look out.

240
00:12:22,873 --> 00:12:26,209
Angela, $200
- Got it

241
00:12:27,044 --> 00:12:28,419
Seriously, Angela?

242
00:12:28,504 --> 00:12:33,716
I know what,
let's go $10,000

243
00:12:33,926 --> 00:12:36,594
Five, four You're
just saying numbers.

244
00:12:36,679 --> 00:12:38,471
It's meaningless.
Three

245
00:12:38,556 --> 00:12:43,017
It's literally like
Two, one

246
00:12:58,284 --> 00:13:00,118
There you go

247
00:13:01,287 --> 00:13:03,788
Hey, we're going to
have a nice hot date

248
00:13:07,918 --> 00:13:09,335
What are you guys
talking about?

249
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:11,337
Charlie Rose I don't know who that is

250
00:13:11,422 --> 00:13:12,422
Guys
He has...

251
00:13:12,506 --> 00:13:14,048
Guys, come here

252
00:13:16,719 --> 00:13:18,303
What are you...
Come on

253
00:13:21,390 --> 00:13:22,765
Where are we going?

254
00:13:23,684 --> 00:13:25,476
Okay. Do you guys want

255
00:13:25,561 --> 00:13:27,478
Andy, you should
not stand there.

256
00:13:27,563 --> 00:13:30,148
The warehouse guys
pee there all the time

257
00:13:31,525 --> 00:13:32,525
Ew

258
00:13:34,278 --> 00:13:37,196
Okay. Do you guys want to
be part of something huge?

259
00:13:37,323 --> 00:13:39,240
I'm already a member of the
largest club there is.

260
00:13:39,325 --> 00:13:40,700
Non-churchgoing
Christians.

261
00:13:42,953 --> 00:13:44,996
You remember in
the movie Rudy,

262
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:47,957
when the player comes
into the coach's office

263
00:13:48,042 --> 00:13:49,959
and he throws his jersey
down and he's like,

264
00:13:50,044 --> 00:13:51,502
"I'm not playing
without Rudy.'

265
00:13:51,587 --> 00:13:53,963
And the coach is like,
"One guy. No big deal.'

266
00:13:54,048 --> 00:13:56,674
But then every player
comes in, one by one

267
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:00,053
and they all throw their jerseys
down for Rudy. Remember that?

268
00:14:00,179 --> 00:14:02,180
Yeah, I remember that

269
00:14:02,264 --> 00:14:04,807
So, how amazing
would it be

270
00:14:04,892 --> 00:14:07,936
if you guys all
did that for me

271
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:11,606
with your own brand new
Dunder Mifflin jerseys?

272
00:14:12,232 --> 00:14:13,566
Hey, guys

273
00:14:20,658 --> 00:14:23,159
Gross. Gross, gross

274
00:14:23,243 --> 00:14:24,535
You don't need to go

275
00:14:24,828 --> 00:14:26,663
while I was journaling,

276
00:14:26,747 --> 00:14:28,247
and they reminded
me of you.

277
00:14:29,708 --> 00:14:31,084
Those are from our weekend
at the time-share.

278
00:14:31,210 --> 00:14:33,044
Yeah, the fractional
ownership property

279
00:14:34,463 --> 00:14:36,547
We took this one right before
we got in that huge fight

280
00:14:37,591 --> 00:14:39,050
God, I don't even remember
what that fight was about.

281
00:14:39,134 --> 00:14:40,134
You were being
really bratty about

282
00:14:40,219 --> 00:14:41,302
where we would
go out to dinner

283
00:14:41,387 --> 00:14:45,765
but all I remember is how pretty you
looked taking those pictures of me

284
00:14:47,476 --> 00:14:49,602
Anyway, if you want to
order prints of your own,

285
00:14:51,230 --> 00:14:52,939
Yeah, that'd
be cool. Thanks

286
00:14:53,023 --> 00:14:54,107
I'd like that

287
00:14:54,650 --> 00:14:57,151
You were so annoyed that I
was taking that picture

288
00:14:57,403 --> 00:14:59,112
Someone's into my abs

289
00:15:03,742 --> 00:15:04,742
Sorry

290
00:15:06,912 --> 00:15:08,705
You have doubles of this one, I
could probably just take one

291
00:15:08,789 --> 00:15:09,998
I really want both

292
00:15:10,457 --> 00:15:13,751
I am seeing a side of Ryan
that I have never seen

293
00:15:13,836 --> 00:15:15,503
since the last time
we were broken up

294
00:15:15,963 --> 00:15:18,256
with Kelly Kapoor

295
00:15:18,507 --> 00:15:21,342
And I don't know how I'm going
to feel tomorrow or the next day

296
00:15:21,427 --> 00:15:26,139
or the day after that, but I do
know that right here, right now

297
00:15:26,223 --> 00:15:30,101
all I can think about is spending
the rest of my life with her.

298
00:15:31,770 --> 00:15:33,604
Again, that could change

299
00:15:35,691 --> 00:15:39,277
Hey. So, last night
was so not a big deal

300
00:15:39,486 --> 00:15:40,945
Oh, yeah,
I was just tired

301
00:15:40,946 --> 00:15:42,155
We both were
Yeah.

302
00:15:42,239 --> 00:15:44,991
Plus I was definitely
not my normal sexy self

303
00:15:45,701 --> 00:15:48,995
No. Are you kidding?
You were so sexy.

304
00:15:49,079 --> 00:15:52,623
Just the thought of you last
night like, crazy turns me on

305
00:15:53,709 --> 00:15:57,128
It just didn't last night
But you were so dang doable

306
00:15:57,546 --> 00:15:58,546
Even though we didn't do it

307
00:15:58,672 --> 00:16:02,341
Well, it's not like we can't do it
again when Whenever you're ready.

308
00:16:03,385 --> 00:16:06,804
Uh, yeah. We are sexing it up tonight.
I don't care what you say

309
00:16:07,014 --> 00:16:09,640
No. It will be consensual

310
00:16:10,184 --> 00:16:11,809
Whether you like it or not

311
00:16:12,478 --> 00:16:15,104
Sounds good
I'm gonna do you

312
00:16:15,189 --> 00:16:16,731
Not if I do you first.
Oh

313
00:16:19,151 --> 00:16:21,652
But really
it's not a big deal

314
00:16:25,449 --> 00:16:29,619
Yeah. I know it's
not a big deal.

315
00:16:33,916 --> 00:16:36,793
Oh, hey, instead of lunch do
you feel like going shopping?

316
00:16:37,753 --> 00:16:39,837
Are you serious? Yes

317
00:16:40,881 --> 00:16:43,466
That would be... I can't
Can you believe this?

318
00:16:43,842 --> 00:16:45,301
Hey, can you believe it? Nope

319
00:16:47,012 --> 00:16:48,012
Hmm

320
00:16:48,722 --> 00:16:51,307
Oh, do you want that dress in
every size and every color?

321
00:16:51,475 --> 00:16:52,767
Yeah, it's free returns

322
00:16:54,603 --> 00:16:56,229
getting along
with Ryan again

323
00:16:56,980 --> 00:17:00,358
He's so sweet He pointed
to my latte and he said

324
00:17:00,442 --> 00:17:02,860
"Kelly, that would be
the color of our children.'

325
00:17:03,821 --> 00:17:05,905
God. Yeah, he's so great

326
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:10,535
Remember how it felt when
he cheated on you, though?

327
00:17:10,953 --> 00:17:11,953
Which time?

328
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:18,876
I am not going to let Kelly
throw her life away on Ryan

329
00:17:19,711 --> 00:17:23,256
And it has nothing to do with
access to my pediatrician

330
00:17:23,340 --> 00:17:25,716
Why you would even ask
or were going to ask

331
00:17:25,801 --> 00:17:28,177
Because I feel like
that question was coming

332
00:17:28,262 --> 00:17:30,638
But, you know, whatever
Ask me anything.

333
00:17:30,931 --> 00:17:32,849
When you lost the
manager job Yes?

334
00:17:32,933 --> 00:17:36,435
did it affect you
outside of the office?

335
00:17:36,562 --> 00:17:37,728
How?

336
00:17:38,147 --> 00:17:40,690
I don't know what
the technical term is

337
00:17:42,317 --> 00:17:45,820
Penial softy-osus

338
00:17:49,074 --> 00:17:51,075
Erin, I am so glad
that you trusted me

339
00:17:51,410 --> 00:17:54,078
You came to the exact
right person for this.

340
00:17:54,288 --> 00:17:57,540
No, I have never once experienced
anything remotely like that.

341
00:17:57,875 --> 00:17:59,750
Ever, ever. Never

342
00:18:03,839 --> 00:18:05,256
Okay?
Okay

343
00:18:06,341 --> 00:18:08,092
Washington Monument
Okay

344
00:18:10,888 --> 00:18:12,388
Eiffel Tower!
Okay

345
00:18:13,432 --> 00:18:15,183
Colossus at Rhodes

346
00:18:16,768 --> 00:18:19,520
Hey! I hear you've been
badmouthing me to Kelly

347
00:18:20,647 --> 00:18:23,024
All I did was remind her that
you used to treat her badly

348
00:18:23,108 --> 00:18:26,527
Well, that's your opinion and it's
her opinion, but it's not my opinion

349
00:18:26,612 --> 00:18:29,989
If you have something bad to say
to me, Pam say it to my face

350
00:18:30,657 --> 00:18:31,908
Fair enough. Um

351
00:18:34,995 --> 00:18:36,746
a very good person

352
00:18:37,372 --> 00:18:40,082
And forgive me, but I feel like
I've said this to you before.

353
00:18:41,335 --> 00:18:45,213
Well, a lot of people would say that I'm
a better match for Kelly than Ravi is

354
00:18:45,631 --> 00:18:49,467
Come on, Ryan, really?
Ravi's way better.

355
00:18:50,427 --> 00:18:52,094
For Kelly?
Yeah.

356
00:18:52,179 --> 00:18:56,057
Man, you're insane right now
Ravi's the whole package.

357
00:18:56,141 --> 00:18:58,392
I've never met Ravi
personally,

358
00:18:58,477 --> 00:19:00,019
but I'm going to
go ahead and say

359
00:19:00,103 --> 00:19:02,772
just having known you
a short while, Brian,

360
00:19:02,856 --> 00:19:07,151
that I prefer Ravi, and again
I've never even met the guy.

361
00:19:07,319 --> 00:19:10,279
Kelly, look around
Nobody believes in us

362
00:19:10,656 --> 00:19:11,656
Nobody

363
00:19:11,990 --> 00:19:14,825
Ryan, just stop making a scene
in front of all my friends

364
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:18,162
Kelly, I wrote you the
most amazing love poem.

365
00:19:18,872 --> 00:19:22,667
But I can't even read it.
My heart couldn't handle it

366
00:19:22,751 --> 00:19:24,835
Oh, come on... Oh, no,
no, no read it, please.

367
00:19:26,630 --> 00:19:28,589
No, it would cause
me too much pain.

368
00:19:28,674 --> 00:19:29,966
Read through
the pain. Be strong

369
00:19:30,050 --> 00:19:31,926
This poem would
crush you.

370
00:19:32,010 --> 00:19:35,096
God, Ryan, go away She found
herself a beautiful boyfriend

371
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:38,057
Yeah, man, he's
absolutely gorgeous

372
00:19:38,141 --> 00:19:39,433
Please leave her alone

373
00:19:39,518 --> 00:19:42,395
You see, Kelly?
Our love scares them

374
00:19:42,479 --> 00:19:45,189
It screws up their
cookie cutter world

375
00:19:50,988 --> 00:19:52,738
Do you guys think
he's right, though?

376
00:19:54,533 --> 00:19:56,951
Do we live in a
cookie cutter's world?

377
00:19:57,035 --> 00:19:59,787
Absolutely, but it's
not the point. God

378
00:20:01,331 --> 00:20:04,875
One of Toby's eyes is getting smaller.
So there's that

379
00:20:05,877 --> 00:20:09,255
Gabe bragged about having an extra
ticket to the air show this weekend

380
00:20:09,339 --> 00:20:12,967
and Meredith said she was interested,
and then Gabe said immediately

381
00:20:13,051 --> 00:20:15,344
that his friend might
be taking the ticket,

382
00:20:15,429 --> 00:20:17,972
so I'll keep you
posted on that.

383
00:20:18,265 --> 00:20:20,808
Every day, I brief Nellie on
what's going on in the office.

384
00:20:20,892 --> 00:20:21,976
Most of it's irrelevant

385
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:24,562
But a good informer doesn't
judge what's worth passing on.

386
00:20:24,896 --> 00:20:26,731
Oh, and Andy lost
his masculinity,

387
00:20:26,815 --> 00:20:27,982
so congratulations
on that.

388
00:20:28,317 --> 00:20:29,317
What do you mean?

389
00:20:29,526 --> 00:20:30,985
Erin made it clear to me
that he was unable

390
00:20:31,069 --> 00:20:32,486
to perform sexually
last night.

391
00:20:32,571 --> 00:20:34,613
By contrast, I went to sleep
with an erection so large

392
00:20:34,698 --> 00:20:36,407
it was like I was
wearing no blanket at all

393
00:20:37,284 --> 00:20:40,578
but you just
demolished him!

394
00:20:41,371 --> 00:20:42,830
I'm little bit
jealous, actually

395
00:20:42,914 --> 00:20:45,082
Reduced him to a mere ant

396
00:20:45,417 --> 00:20:48,836
I just wanted to take the
man's job not his manhood.

397
00:20:49,671 --> 00:20:51,547
Are we good?
Everybody got a jersey?

398
00:20:52,007 --> 00:20:54,675
I still think it's weird
that we're just doing Rudy.

399
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:57,470
Like, not a spin on it
we're just doing it.

400
00:20:57,554 --> 00:21:00,264
What about The Dead Poets
Society?\ Much better movie

401
00:21:00,432 --> 00:21:03,100
What? Get your movie
rankings right, dude.

402
00:21:03,185 --> 00:21:04,894
Why can't we just do
whatever movie we want?

403
00:21:04,978 --> 00:21:06,270
'Cause I was gonna
do a Spartacus.

404
00:21:06,355 --> 00:21:07,730
Oh, I wanna do
a Spartacus.

405
00:21:07,814 --> 00:21:08,981
I am Spartacus

406
00:21:09,066 --> 00:21:10,524
No, I am Spartacus

407
00:21:10,942 --> 00:21:14,236
Hey, guys, we're doing Rudy, okay?
So get ready

408
00:21:14,363 --> 00:21:17,198
Okay, I would like to invite
everyone into the conference room

409
00:21:17,282 --> 00:21:19,367
Sure. But first,
there is something

410
00:21:19,451 --> 00:21:21,369
No, that's not important
Conference room, now.

411
00:21:21,495 --> 00:21:23,954
You can't
call a meeting, so

412
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:27,041
But I would like
to have a meeting

413
00:21:27,125 --> 00:21:28,292
in the conference
room right now,

414
00:21:28,377 --> 00:21:30,920
so come on, guys let's get
in the conference room.

415
00:21:31,004 --> 00:21:32,296
Thank you. Good

416
00:21:32,798 --> 00:21:34,465
Thank you for
coming to my meeting

417
00:21:34,549 --> 00:21:35,549
Appreciate it

418
00:21:36,259 --> 00:21:39,095
Okay, if you would like to take
a seat, we can get started.

419
00:21:39,262 --> 00:21:41,472
Can't do it because I got
to run a meeting, so

420
00:21:41,807 --> 00:21:45,643
Wanted to talk to all of
you guys about importance

421
00:21:46,645 --> 00:21:52,817
and know that each and every one
of you is vitally important

422
00:21:52,901 --> 00:21:57,238
Andrew, not everyone here is important.
And the word is "impotence.'

423
00:21:57,406 --> 00:22:00,825
Which is important
in its own way

424
00:22:00,909 --> 00:22:02,368
so if you'd just like
to take a seat, Andy

425
00:22:02,619 --> 00:22:05,079
Take a man's job,
but leave him his balls

426
00:22:05,163 --> 00:22:07,498
Margaret Thatcher
said that, probably

427
00:22:07,833 --> 00:22:10,000
Don't know. Don't read
Didn't see the movie.

428
00:22:10,502 --> 00:22:12,920
So, Nellie wanted to have
a meeting on impotence.

429
00:22:13,004 --> 00:22:15,214
Have to run it
as impotence is a concept

430
00:22:15,298 --> 00:22:17,174
as foreign to me
as baba ghanoush

431
00:22:19,094 --> 00:22:20,761
Something to do
with eggplant

432
00:22:22,013 --> 00:22:23,097
That's all I know

433
00:22:23,974 --> 00:22:27,810
This meeting is not about any
one person in particular

434
00:22:27,894 --> 00:22:30,646
It is a human problem. It's
not just a human problem

435
00:22:30,981 --> 00:22:32,940
Flounders frequently
experience impotence

436
00:22:33,024 --> 00:22:34,733
especially when converting
from male to female

437
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:36,777
and then back again to male
- Really?

438
00:22:36,862 --> 00:22:40,573
Nellie, does the "person" affected
by this want us to help her

439
00:22:40,699 --> 00:22:41,949
in any way in particular?

440
00:22:42,033 --> 00:22:43,075
Oh! Oh

441
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:44,827
It's not me. No, no

442
00:22:44,911 --> 00:22:47,288
I've never had any
problem in that arena

443
00:22:47,372 --> 00:22:49,999
And I have been
with several older men

444
00:22:50,208 --> 00:22:51,167
How old?
How old?

445
00:22:51,251 --> 00:22:52,585
Jinx, buy me some Coke

446
00:22:52,878 --> 00:22:54,545
Dwight told me
about it earlier

447
00:22:54,921 --> 00:22:56,213
Dwight?

448
00:22:57,090 --> 00:22:58,090
You promised

449
00:22:58,175 --> 00:22:59,925
Dwight couldn't
get it up for Nellie?

450
00:23:00,010 --> 00:23:02,303
No, no, no, no, no
it's not me.

451
00:23:02,721 --> 00:23:04,972
I'm going to prove it
right here and now.

452
00:23:05,557 --> 00:23:08,309
What are you doing?
Stop that, Dwight

453
00:23:08,852 --> 00:23:10,227
Stop that, stop it

454
00:23:11,396 --> 00:23:15,399
Fine, it was me. I couldn't I had
a problem with Erin last night

455
00:23:15,484 --> 00:23:16,650
Happy?

456
00:23:16,818 --> 00:23:20,988
My mind last night
and I didn't perform

457
00:23:22,032 --> 00:23:23,949
Okay, it happens
to plenty of guys

458
00:23:24,784 --> 00:23:29,371
It's usually not followed by a giant
workplace discussion and an interview

459
00:23:30,999 --> 00:23:36,629
Every guy in this room has been
touched by this affliction. Tuna?

460
00:23:37,005 --> 00:23:38,255
D-Dog

461
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:41,008
Um

462
00:23:44,554 --> 00:23:47,598
I'm terrible at math
overweight

463
00:23:47,807 --> 00:23:51,977
You're in great shape A lot better
shape than I am tell you what.

464
00:23:52,229 --> 00:23:55,773
It seems Andy is the only
one with this problem

465
00:23:55,857 --> 00:23:57,316
Fascinating
Fascinating

466
00:23:57,400 --> 00:24:00,444
what the problem is
Erin doesn't even like sex

467
00:24:00,529 --> 00:24:03,113
Remember? You said it feels like
getting tackled by a skeleton

468
00:24:03,615 --> 00:24:06,700
Chumbo, come on, help me out Any
problems with Little Chumbo?

469
00:24:06,952 --> 00:24:08,118
Tip top shape

470
00:24:08,995 --> 00:24:11,455
Stanley
No. Mmm-mmm

471
00:24:11,748 --> 00:24:13,874
Creed, you are
1,000 years old

472
00:24:14,251 --> 00:24:16,710
Haven't heard any complaints
Wouldn't care if I did

473
00:24:17,212 --> 00:24:18,295
Okay, so
Actually, Andy

474
00:24:18,421 --> 00:24:21,215
we've experienced it

475
00:24:21,299 --> 00:24:22,299
What happened?

476
00:24:22,926 --> 00:24:25,553
A couple of times.
A couple of times?

477
00:24:25,637 --> 00:24:28,264
Jim, maybe you could tell us
about one of those times.

478
00:24:28,348 --> 00:24:29,640
Yeah. Get it out there
- Yeah, Jim.

479
00:24:29,766 --> 00:24:30,766
Um

480
00:24:34,062 --> 00:24:37,523
Uh, yes, that time
that it was very late

481
00:24:37,983 --> 00:24:39,024
Uh.

482
00:24:39,109 --> 00:24:42,945
We had had sex so many times
already I was exhausted

483
00:24:43,071 --> 00:24:44,947
Okay, stop. I could barely
see I was very drunk

484
00:24:45,073 --> 00:24:46,657
If it makes you
feel any better

485
00:24:46,741 --> 00:24:49,577
I never had an orgasm
until I was 42

486
00:24:49,786 --> 00:24:53,455
And then when I did,
it lasted until I was 44

487
00:24:53,915 --> 00:24:55,874
Forty-three was just

488
00:24:59,671 --> 00:25:02,256
I've read, and I don't know
anything about this personally

489
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:04,508
but they say prostate
stimulation can help.

490
00:25:04,593 --> 00:25:05,593
Ugh

491
00:25:05,677 --> 00:25:07,595
This is just a This American
Life I think I heard

492
00:25:07,721 --> 00:25:10,097
No, that's absolutely the case.
I know, right?

493
00:25:10,181 --> 00:25:14,059
You know my rectal electro-ejaculator
is rated for bovine use only

494
00:25:14,144 --> 00:25:15,144
but I could let you rent it

495
00:25:15,854 --> 00:25:19,815
Andy, why don't you tell us about
the best erection of your life?

496
00:25:20,025 --> 00:25:24,194
Or does anyone else have any remarkable
erections they'd like to share?

497
00:25:24,321 --> 00:25:25,446
Wow. Oh What are
we talking about?

498
00:25:25,530 --> 00:25:27,448
Toby, doesn't HR
have some rules

499
00:25:27,532 --> 00:25:28,907
against talking about
this kind of stuff?

500
00:25:29,409 --> 00:25:32,661
Erin, HR is a joke. I can't
do anything about anything

501
00:25:32,746 --> 00:25:36,749
The most important thing to remember
is do not stress about this

502
00:25:36,833 --> 00:25:39,209
Stress just makes it worse

503
00:25:39,294 --> 00:25:42,588
and then you stress more
and that's a vicious spiral

504
00:25:43,465 --> 00:25:45,674
come in today

505
00:25:47,552 --> 00:25:49,011
Dad, don't think
of it as a demotion

506
00:25:49,095 --> 00:25:51,597
just think of it as a
promotion to a lower level.

507
00:25:52,015 --> 00:25:54,350
I don't think you have to
tell your friends anything

508
00:25:54,434 --> 00:25:55,768
It hasn't been
decided yet.

509
00:25:55,852 --> 00:25:58,687
Erin, on the phone memos you're
writing the date American style

510
00:25:58,772 --> 00:26:01,982
Month, day, year. I prefer
it day, month, year

511
00:26:02,067 --> 00:26:03,400
Small, bigger, biggest

512
00:26:03,485 --> 00:26:04,485
Oh

513
00:26:04,569 --> 00:26:06,612
Sexual innuendo
not intentional.

514
00:26:07,072 --> 00:26:09,907
Shut up. Shut up, liar

515
00:26:10,533 --> 00:26:14,244
"Sexual innuendo
not intentional!"

516
00:26:14,454 --> 00:26:17,581
I am sick of
your dumb opinions

517
00:26:17,832 --> 00:26:21,794
and if you don't like the way
that I take phone messages, here

518
00:26:22,545 --> 00:26:23,629
Take them yourself

519
00:26:26,049 --> 00:26:29,343
Our sex life is none
of anyone's business

520
00:26:29,469 --> 00:26:32,930
And Andy is the manager
Not Nellie

521
00:26:33,181 --> 00:26:36,225
Stop protecting me! I'm a man!
I can protect myself

522
00:26:36,309 --> 00:26:37,851
This is misdirected anger
and I'm sorry!

523
00:26:37,936 --> 00:26:39,019
I don't mean to
lash out at you

524
00:26:39,104 --> 00:26:41,355
There's a lot coming up
right now all at once

525
00:26:41,439 --> 00:26:43,440
Dad, go to he
I'm taller than you

526
00:26:43,566 --> 00:26:45,401
Okay, just calm down

527
00:26:45,777 --> 00:26:48,570
You are not the manager
I earned that job!

528
00:26:48,947 --> 00:26:51,365
Chosen after Robert
was chosen and quit

529
00:26:51,741 --> 00:26:53,325
Andy, why don't you
just take a seat?

530
00:26:53,451 --> 00:26:55,244
Why don't you
take a seat, idiot?

531
00:26:56,246 --> 00:26:58,789
Why don't you take
all your stupid memos?

532
00:26:58,957 --> 00:27:02,042
And your stupid pens
and your dumb caramels

533
00:27:02,502 --> 00:27:04,503
And your stupid face

534
00:27:05,338 --> 00:27:07,172
And your stupid office

535
00:27:08,049 --> 00:27:09,049
Ah! Ow

536
00:27:13,096 --> 00:27:15,180
He does not
like that wall

537
00:27:18,685 --> 00:27:21,895
Maybe we'll get sent to
anger management together.

538
00:27:23,648 --> 00:27:27,151
That would actually be cool I'd love
for you to meet some of the guys

539
00:27:31,781 --> 00:27:33,991
Andy, Erin
you can join us now

540
00:27:48,298 --> 00:27:50,007
What do you like
about Ryan?

541
00:27:50,425 --> 00:27:53,719
Ryan keeps up with all
the latest technology trends

542
00:27:53,803 --> 00:27:56,680
And he's very honest with me
about when I put on weight

543
00:27:57,849 --> 00:28:00,559
And he has the soul
and the body of a poet

544
00:28:00,852 --> 00:28:01,852
Mmm

545
00:28:01,936 --> 00:28:03,020
Ravi's hotter

546
00:28:03,563 --> 00:28:05,647
and looks are subjective,

547
00:28:05,732 --> 00:28:07,566
but there's no
question about it

548
00:28:08,026 --> 00:28:09,151
Yeah, but I'm just worried

549
00:28:09,235 --> 00:28:10,360
that I'm only
attracted to Rav

550
00:28:10,445 --> 00:28:13,405
because he looks exactly like this Calvin
Klein model that I'm attracted to.

551
00:28:13,531 --> 00:28:14,782
Who cares? That's fine

552
00:28:14,866 --> 00:28:17,367
When I was your age, I had to
choose between a Ryan and a Rav

553
00:28:17,452 --> 00:28:18,827
and I chose the Ryan

554
00:28:20,163 --> 00:28:22,206
And if I hadn't,
I wouldn't have my kids

555
00:28:23,917 --> 00:28:25,209
You'd still have kids

556
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:28,670
Better kids. You've
got to go with Ravi.

557
00:28:29,297 --> 00:28:32,883
Here's my advice Figure out
what your heart wants.

558
00:28:32,967 --> 00:28:35,886
And if it's not Ravi,
change it. To Ravi

559
00:28:41,267 --> 00:28:43,936
why this is
a dilemma for you

560
00:28:44,938 --> 00:28:46,855
He has, like,
this je ne sais quoi.

561
00:28:48,441 --> 00:28:49,566
He taught me that

562
00:28:52,403 --> 00:28:54,363
Ravi makes me
incredibly happy

563
00:28:54,447 --> 00:28:56,990
And Ryan puts me
through so much drama

564
00:28:57,075 --> 00:28:58,367
So I guess I just
have to decide

565
00:28:58,451 --> 00:29:01,078
which of those is
more important to me

566
00:29:01,996 --> 00:29:05,165
Andy, we're going to go
with Nellie as manager

567
00:29:05,250 --> 00:29:07,251
and put you back
on the sales team

568
00:29:07,377 --> 00:29:11,922
we'll all laugh
about this incident.

569
00:29:12,006 --> 00:29:14,466
I already think
it's kind of funny

570
00:29:21,641 --> 00:29:22,683
No

571
00:29:23,726 --> 00:29:24,977
Excuse me?

572
00:29:26,104 --> 00:29:27,312
I'm saying no

573
00:29:28,773 --> 00:29:30,607
Well, you can't say no

574
00:29:31,067 --> 00:29:32,192
No

575
00:29:36,114 --> 00:29:38,323
Oh. Boo

576
00:29:38,408 --> 00:29:39,658
Holy crap

577
00:29:40,285 --> 00:29:43,579
Boo! Boo! Boo to you Pam, you
are toxic You are toxic.

578
00:29:43,997 --> 00:29:47,791
Kelly, I have a few things to say
to you, but please don't interrupt

579
00:29:47,917 --> 00:29:50,377
Yeah, but you do
a lot, so just don't.

580
00:29:50,461 --> 00:29:53,046
Thank you. I know that I
haven't always treated you

581
00:29:53,131 --> 00:29:55,090
the way that you
for whatever reason

582
00:29:55,174 --> 00:29:57,426
feel you deserve
to be treated

583
00:29:57,635 --> 00:29:59,303
But I want to marry you
Kelly Kapoor

584
00:30:00,346 --> 00:30:03,557
Maybe not today, maybe not
tomorrow but some day.

585
00:30:04,058 --> 00:30:05,058
And probably

586
00:30:05,351 --> 00:30:07,728
Barf! Oh! You suck

587
00:30:07,812 --> 00:30:09,229
What is your problem?

588
00:30:09,314 --> 00:30:11,690
Hey, can we turn this back
around quickly please?

589
00:30:11,816 --> 00:30:13,817
Can we turn this around quickly?
This is very important to me

590
00:30:14,068 --> 00:30:16,236
Turn around
Turn around

591
00:30:16,321 --> 00:30:18,572
Can we turn this * thing around, please?
Thank you.

592
00:30:18,698 --> 00:30:20,490
She don't want to turn around.
Thank you

593
00:30:21,743 --> 00:30:25,037
Kelly, I can't promise you that
we'll always stay together,

594
00:30:25,288 --> 00:30:28,248
I can't promise you that I'll
never cheat on you Nor should I

595
00:30:28,333 --> 00:30:31,084
Modern marriages aren't built that
way Men aren't built that way

596
00:30:31,169 --> 00:30:33,003
There's a very interesting
article I can email to you

597
00:30:33,171 --> 00:30:35,797
But I can tell you this,
even if the odds are 50-50

598
00:30:35,882 --> 00:30:37,758
that we'll break up
within the week

599
00:30:41,137 --> 00:30:42,846
Ryan

600
00:30:42,931 --> 00:30:44,181
Will you roll
those dice with me?

601
00:30:45,058 --> 00:30:47,184
You mean so much to me

602
00:30:48,102 --> 00:30:51,188
But I love Ravi and I
choose him No, you don't

603
00:30:51,272 --> 00:30:52,272
No, you don't

604
00:30:52,523 --> 00:30:54,232
still be friends

605
00:30:57,779 --> 00:30:59,363
Can I have a hug?

606
00:31:06,704 --> 00:31:08,580
Oh. Ew

607
00:31:08,665 --> 00:31:11,500
Well, it's good to see
Kelly is maturing.

608
00:31:12,168 --> 00:31:13,460
Oh, God

609
00:31:13,878 --> 00:31:18,465
Look, Andrew, we can discuss
the specifics of the job.

610
00:31:18,967 --> 00:31:19,967
No

611
00:31:20,218 --> 00:31:22,344
It's the apology. I really have to insist

612
00:31:22,470 --> 00:31:24,388
No
Stop saying "no."

613
00:31:24,597 --> 00:31:25,722
No

614
00:31:25,807 --> 00:31:28,892
Andrew, if you say "no" one
more time you're fired.

615
00:31:30,061 --> 00:31:33,480
So, is there anything
else you want to say?

616
00:31:34,899 --> 00:31:35,899
No

617
00:31:36,109 --> 00:31:38,360
I can't describe it. I just, for
the first time in a long time,

618
00:31:44,033 --> 00:31:45,701
Here.

619
00:31:47,036 --> 00:31:50,122
But you hurt your hand. I got it

620
00:31:50,873 --> 00:31:52,958
Right now?
Yes

621
00:32:08,891 --> 00:32:10,726
You're not the
least bit curious

622
00:32:10,810 --> 00:32:13,645
to hear a poem straight
from Ryan's soul?

623
00:32:13,730 --> 00:32:14,813
Not at all.
Can we go?

624
00:32:14,939 --> 00:32:17,566
"Kapoor and Ka-desperate
he watches.'

625
00:32:18,109 --> 00:32:20,277
Second line! "He is a
drifter out to sea."

626
00:32:21,279 --> 00:32:24,781
"And when the Indian Ocean calms
one speck of white remains

627
00:32:25,450 --> 00:32:27,951
"in waters cold
and Kelly green.'

628
00:32:28,119 --> 00:32:29,870
It's just so dumb

629
00:32:31,497 --> 00:32:36,168
But when he describes himself as
a child lost on a life raft...

630
00:32:39,130 --> 00:32:40,881
Ryan can never know
