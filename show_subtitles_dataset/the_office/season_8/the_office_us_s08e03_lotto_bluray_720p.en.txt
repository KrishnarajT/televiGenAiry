1
00:00:01,034 --> 00:00:03,160
Back orders and you
never called them

2
00:00:04,371 --> 00:00:07,247
Can you believe this?
There's a dog in the car.

3
00:00:09,542 --> 00:00:11,377
You can't leave a dog
in a parked car!

4
00:00:11,878 --> 00:00:13,796
Snowboarder, it figures

5
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:15,339
Do snowboarders
hate animals?

6
00:00:15,423 --> 00:00:17,591
I bet this guy didn't
leave his weed in the car

7
00:00:17,968 --> 00:00:21,178
Okay, we have to do something because
this is incredibly dangerous.

8
00:00:21,304 --> 00:00:22,513
Oscar, it's not
that hot out

9
00:00:22,597 --> 00:00:24,723
A car parked in the sun
is like a toaster oven.

10
00:00:25,392 --> 00:00:27,226
Well, we don't know how long
the driver's been gone

11
00:00:27,310 --> 00:00:29,061
and it's not
in direct sunlight

12
00:00:29,145 --> 00:00:31,313
So what, Andy? You want to
just let him die, you scumbag?

13
00:00:31,398 --> 00:00:33,440
Here, I'm going
to get in my car

14
00:00:33,525 --> 00:00:37,027
When I start dying, I will
honk the horn three times

15
00:00:37,112 --> 00:00:38,821
That means
save the dog

16
00:00:38,905 --> 00:00:39,989
Okay
you know what?

17
00:00:40,073 --> 00:00:41,407
I'm going to give him
something to drink

18
00:00:41,491 --> 00:00:42,491
Come here, doggy

19
00:00:45,078 --> 00:00:46,078
Come on

20
00:00:46,162 --> 00:00:47,162
Dwight
at least aim it

21
00:00:47,247 --> 00:00:48,497
There you go
Here, doggy.

22
00:00:48,581 --> 00:00:50,082
He's not even trying Come
here doggy, come on.

23
00:00:50,166 --> 00:00:51,417
We're losing
cloud cover.

24
00:00:51,501 --> 00:00:53,168
Don't try to get in
on it now, Michael Vick

25
00:00:53,253 --> 00:00:55,254
Hey, hey, hey
Vick did his time

26
00:00:55,338 --> 00:00:58,298
This guy's been gone long enough.
He's lost his right to a window.

27
00:00:58,383 --> 00:00:59,550
Get back, buddy
Get back

28
00:00:59,634 --> 00:01:00,843
Oscar, what are you
What... No, hey

29
00:01:04,264 --> 00:01:05,431
All right

30
00:01:05,515 --> 00:01:06,849
Yeah

31
00:01:06,933 --> 00:01:08,600
Nice job, Oscar

32
00:01:08,727 --> 00:01:11,103
And one
for good measure.

33
00:01:11,271 --> 00:01:12,479
Yeah

34
00:01:12,564 --> 00:01:14,773
So, who's going
to take the dog?

35
00:01:15,066 --> 00:01:16,442
Why would we
take the dog?

36
00:01:16,693 --> 00:01:18,318
What if he jumps out
the window and runs away?

37
00:01:18,611 --> 00:01:20,654
Jim, he's not
going to start...

38
00:01:20,739 --> 00:01:21,947
Stay, stay

39
00:01:22,032 --> 00:01:23,657
Nein. Sitz!

40
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:25,367
Gut.

41
00:01:25,452 --> 00:01:27,661
Oscar, what do you want to do?
This is kind of your deal.

42
00:01:28,121 --> 00:01:29,121
You want a dog?

43
00:01:33,334 --> 00:01:34,877
There we go
that should do it

44
00:01:34,961 --> 00:01:36,962
Yeah, it's good.
It'll work

45
00:01:37,047 --> 00:01:38,005
Nice job

46
00:01:38,131 --> 00:01:39,631
Bye, poochie
Bye, doggy

47
00:01:39,716 --> 00:01:41,383
Bye

48
00:02:08,661 --> 00:02:10,746
What's that come to? Like,
what did they each win?

49
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:13,415
Oh, man, it's gotta
be over $100,000.

50
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:14,792
Yeah, before taxes

51
00:02:14,876 --> 00:02:16,668
That's still
a lot of money

52
00:02:17,337 --> 00:02:19,713
The warehouse crew won
the lottery yesterday.

53
00:02:20,131 --> 00:02:22,758
$950,000.

54
00:02:23,176 --> 00:02:24,218
And then they quit.

55
00:02:24,427 --> 00:02:26,011
And no one else
can focus.

56
00:02:26,346 --> 00:02:27,304
This is it.

57
00:02:27,388 --> 00:02:28,722
This is all
on my shoulders.

58
00:02:28,807 --> 00:02:30,933
I'm the one who has to tell
everyone to get back to work

59
00:02:31,017 --> 00:02:33,602
I'm the one who has to tell Darryl
to hire a new warehouse crew

60
00:02:33,686 --> 00:02:36,855
I'm the one who has
to say those things.

61
00:02:40,401 --> 00:02:41,443
Hello?

62
00:02:43,363 --> 00:02:45,364
Justine.

63
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:47,699
Nice surprise.
How you doing, baby?

64
00:02:48,868 --> 00:02:51,787
No, no, no.
I didn't win

65
00:02:51,871 --> 00:02:53,288
When I got promoted
I stopped...

66
00:02:53,373 --> 00:02:54,414
What?

67
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:57,167
Yeah, Glenn won

68
00:02:59,254 --> 00:03:02,131
You want to call him?
Yeah, you should call him

69
00:03:02,215 --> 00:03:03,715
Congratulate him
That would be

70
00:03:04,676 --> 00:03:05,717
What?

71
00:03:06,803 --> 00:03:09,179
His number is
in your old phone

72
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:10,973
Oh, you know what?
I might have it right

73
00:03:11,057 --> 00:03:12,141
Whoops.

74
00:03:12,559 --> 00:03:15,811
When I worked in the warehouse,
I was part of that lotto pool.

75
00:03:16,604 --> 00:03:17,688
They won

76
00:03:18,731 --> 00:03:20,274
playing my birthday

77
00:03:20,733 --> 00:03:23,485
What really interests me is the
group dynamic of six people

78
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:24,570
winning the lottery

79
00:03:24,737 --> 00:03:25,779
This will not
end well, right?

80
00:03:25,864 --> 00:03:26,989
Yeah

81
00:03:27,073 --> 00:03:28,407
We're looking at
at least one suicide

82
00:03:28,491 --> 00:03:30,284
and one weird sex thing.
At least

83
00:03:30,618 --> 00:03:32,244
I don't even know what
I'd do with all that money

84
00:03:32,328 --> 00:03:33,662
I know what you'd do
with all that money

85
00:03:33,746 --> 00:03:36,582
"Hey, Pam Let's buy expensive
bathrobes and hug.'

86
00:03:36,666 --> 00:03:39,042
No, I'd probably buy a big
piece of land in Maine

87
00:03:39,127 --> 00:03:41,128
build a house
work in town.

88
00:03:41,212 --> 00:03:43,672
Somewhere I could
bike to or kayak to.

89
00:03:43,756 --> 00:03:45,924
I'd either bike to my job
at the kayak shop

90
00:03:46,009 --> 00:03:48,010
or I'd kayak to my job
at the bike shop.

91
00:03:48,094 --> 00:03:49,469
And then on the weekends
would you hacky sack

92
00:03:49,554 --> 00:03:51,555
back to reality and spend time
with your wife and kids?

93
00:03:51,890 --> 00:03:54,183
Whoa, Saucy I thought
you liked Maine.

94
00:03:54,267 --> 00:03:56,643
I think we should get
a townhouse in Soho

95
00:03:56,728 --> 00:03:58,145
Soho's mostly lofts
but okay

96
00:03:58,646 --> 00:04:01,398
And then, every morning
I'd walk out onto my terrace

97
00:04:01,482 --> 00:04:04,193
and I would breathe in
the inspiration of the city

98
00:04:04,277 --> 00:04:07,529
You know, and just gather
ideas for my painting

99
00:04:07,614 --> 00:04:08,739
Oh, God

100
00:04:08,990 --> 00:04:10,532
And then my
handsome husband

101
00:04:10,617 --> 00:04:11,825
Which, ideally
would be me.

102
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:12,993
Would bring me
a flavored coffee

103
00:04:13,077 --> 00:04:15,454
Stop. I'm a barista
in your fantasy?

104
00:04:15,538 --> 00:04:17,372
Well, in your fantasy we're
Stephen King characters

105
00:04:17,457 --> 00:04:18,749
I don't know
about Stephen King

106
00:04:18,833 --> 00:04:20,959
Get a divorce
Get a divorce

107
00:04:21,461 --> 00:04:22,878
I think I would
keep working

108
00:04:22,962 --> 00:04:26,465
And for my salary, I guess I
would take like, $1 a year.

109
00:04:27,383 --> 00:04:29,885
Obviously, I wouldn't
come in till noon

110
00:04:29,969 --> 00:04:31,970
And I wouldn't do anything
I didn't want to do

111
00:04:33,264 --> 00:04:36,433
I mean, I'm getting paid $1 a year, okay?
You can chill

112
00:04:37,227 --> 00:04:38,936
Are you kidding me?

113
00:04:39,145 --> 00:04:41,396
Guys, if I have to ask you to
get back to work one more time

114
00:04:41,481 --> 00:04:43,357
I'm gonna change my tone

115
00:04:43,733 --> 00:04:45,359
To down here, like Mr. T

116
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:47,653
And this would get
seriously annoying

117
00:04:48,321 --> 00:04:50,697
I feel sympathy for the jerks who
have to listen to this all day

118
00:04:51,241 --> 00:04:52,241
Darryl

119
00:04:52,325 --> 00:04:53,700
How we doing on
the new warehouse guys?

120
00:04:53,785 --> 00:04:54,826
I don't know

121
00:04:55,411 --> 00:04:57,246
What... Do we have
new guys?

122
00:04:57,330 --> 00:04:58,330
No

123
00:04:58,414 --> 00:04:59,706
Are they on
their way over?

124
00:04:59,791 --> 00:05:00,791
I haven't hired anyone

125
00:05:00,875 --> 00:05:02,417
What? No warehouse guys?

126
00:05:02,502 --> 00:05:04,753
I have an important order
that has to go out by 5:00

127
00:05:04,837 --> 00:05:06,421
I e-mailed you about it

128
00:05:06,506 --> 00:05:08,340
I'm not checking
e-mail till lunch

129
00:05:09,008 --> 00:05:10,217
Four hour work week

130
00:05:10,301 --> 00:05:11,593
This is kind of
time-sensitive

131
00:05:11,678 --> 00:05:12,970
I got it. I'm doing it

132
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,848
Andy, this is a seriously big order.
I can't lose this client.

133
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:18,475
All right, well
until we have a new crew

134
00:05:18,559 --> 00:05:20,060
let's get some volunteers
for warehouse duty

135
00:05:20,144 --> 00:05:21,186
Who's in?

136
00:05:21,312 --> 00:05:22,771
As long as you guys
don't need me up here

137
00:05:22,855 --> 00:05:24,690
I think we'll be fine
No, we don't.

138
00:05:25,775 --> 00:05:27,067
Really? Nobody's going
to help her?

139
00:05:27,402 --> 00:05:29,236
Is chivalry dead?
Are you volunteering?

140
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:31,363
Of course, I would

141
00:05:31,864 --> 00:05:33,782
But my hip

142
00:05:33,866 --> 00:05:35,284
I would kill
to be at 100%

143
00:05:35,368 --> 00:05:36,410
Jim, how about you?

144
00:05:36,494 --> 00:05:37,661
Yeah. I mean

145
00:05:37,745 --> 00:05:39,913
as the strongest person in
this office, I guess I should

146
00:05:39,998 --> 00:05:41,456
Okay, no, no

147
00:05:41,541 --> 00:05:44,251
That... You are
so not... Oh, God

148
00:05:45,753 --> 00:05:48,839
False. Andy,
I will volunteer

149
00:05:49,257 --> 00:05:50,299
Great

150
00:05:51,009 --> 00:05:51,967
And Kevin

151
00:05:53,344 --> 00:05:57,222
Good old Kevin.
He'll do anything

152
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:58,974
Well, guess what?

153
00:05:59,058 --> 00:06:01,893
I will not do
a good job.

154
00:06:05,565 --> 00:06:06,982
Thank you
Sure.

155
00:06:07,066 --> 00:06:08,233
Wait, wait.
What's this?

156
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:10,694
Oh, sorry

157
00:06:10,778 --> 00:06:13,196
I thought it was a
guess-your-baby's-birth-weight pool.

158
00:06:13,614 --> 00:06:16,033
It says "lotto pool'
right on top.

159
00:06:16,117 --> 00:06:17,743
Yeah, and I said sorry

160
00:06:19,412 --> 00:06:20,370
Oh, come on

161
00:06:20,455 --> 00:06:22,497
You really think I'm going
to have a 14-pound baby?

162
00:06:30,798 --> 00:06:32,257
When did I get so fat?

163
00:06:32,342 --> 00:06:33,800
You look awesome

164
00:06:33,885 --> 00:06:35,635
I didn't hire anyone,
if that's why you're here

165
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:36,928
Where are we
in the process?

166
00:06:37,263 --> 00:06:38,847
I have a file
of applicants here

167
00:06:38,931 --> 00:06:41,516
I just gotta open it
look at it,

168
00:06:41,601 --> 00:06:43,435
interview a bunch of guys
hire some of them.

169
00:06:43,519 --> 00:06:45,771
So I say we're in the early
stages of the process.

170
00:06:46,773 --> 00:06:48,565
Did you go out celebrating
with the guys last night?

171
00:06:49,067 --> 00:06:50,650
They guys did invite
me out to celebrate,

172
00:06:50,735 --> 00:06:52,944
but I decided
to just stay home

173
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:55,614
Eat a bunch of tacos
in my basement

174
00:06:56,115 --> 00:06:57,657
You do have
a fantastic basement

175
00:06:57,742 --> 00:06:58,784
I did

176
00:07:00,203 --> 00:07:02,120
I did have
a fantastic basement

177
00:07:03,581 --> 00:07:05,457
Now it smells
like tacos.

178
00:07:06,459 --> 00:07:08,126
You can't air out
a basement

179
00:07:08,795 --> 00:07:10,420
And taco air is heavy

180
00:07:10,963 --> 00:07:12,839
It settles
at the lowest point

181
00:07:15,176 --> 00:07:17,177
Right. Um

182
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:20,138
Well, how about we take
a look at some applications?

183
00:07:21,307 --> 00:07:22,849
This guy wrote his
in green ink.

184
00:07:22,934 --> 00:07:24,184
That's pretty cool
Check it out.

185
00:07:29,649 --> 00:07:30,732
Hey

186
00:07:30,817 --> 00:07:32,901
There you go
There he is

187
00:07:34,487 --> 00:07:36,029
That is not Darryl

188
00:07:36,114 --> 00:07:38,407
I don't know where Darryl is
I suspect, probably,

189
00:07:38,491 --> 00:07:41,993
our Darryl is inside
of Fat Darryl.

190
00:07:43,079 --> 00:07:46,206
Okay, 300 boxes
of 20-pound white

191
00:07:47,125 --> 00:07:50,085
That's 75 boxes per person
So, that's not so bad.

192
00:07:50,169 --> 00:07:51,169
Negative

193
00:07:51,504 --> 00:07:54,464
Three hundred boxes for me
zero for you chumps

194
00:07:54,549 --> 00:07:55,757
Deal with it

195
00:07:57,135 --> 00:07:58,135
Nice

196
00:07:59,929 --> 00:08:01,138
Oh, oh, oh

197
00:08:03,266 --> 00:08:04,307
Damn

198
00:08:17,864 --> 00:08:18,864
Yup

199
00:08:23,369 --> 00:08:25,078
Welcome, everybody

200
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:29,124
My name is Andy, and this
is my other brother, Darryl

201
00:08:32,253 --> 00:08:33,670
What? No Newhart fans?

202
00:08:34,422 --> 00:08:35,505
Okay

203
00:08:35,590 --> 00:08:37,549
Darryl, how do we usually
kick these things off?

204
00:08:38,593 --> 00:08:41,386
You mean, what did we do the last
time the warehouse won the lottery?

205
00:08:41,596 --> 00:08:42,888
Your old crew
won the lottery?

206
00:08:42,972 --> 00:08:48,310
Does anyone have experience
shelving, storing keeping track...

207
00:08:48,394 --> 00:08:49,936
What do we use?
The Dewey Decimal System?

208
00:08:50,021 --> 00:08:52,314
Wait, wait. So, all
the old guys quit?

209
00:08:52,398 --> 00:08:53,482
Oh, yeah
Well

210
00:08:53,566 --> 00:08:56,610
One of them, Glenn is starting
one of those fat camps

211
00:08:56,694 --> 00:08:58,361
where he steals your kid
in the middle of the night

212
00:08:58,446 --> 00:09:01,198
Madge and a couple other guys
might start a strip club.

213
00:09:01,282 --> 00:09:02,491
But on a boat

214
00:09:02,575 --> 00:09:07,746
And Hide is investing in an energy
drink for Asian homosexuals

215
00:09:10,208 --> 00:09:11,666
Could you guys
give us a minute?

216
00:09:12,627 --> 00:09:14,461
But stay close
You're all doing great

217
00:09:15,505 --> 00:09:17,672
Maybe grab a coffee
or if there's any donuts out

218
00:09:17,757 --> 00:09:18,798
you can split one

219
00:09:19,467 --> 00:09:21,593
You know they're for everybody
so people get fussy

220
00:09:22,428 --> 00:09:24,429
You know what?
Just have a donut

221
00:09:34,190 --> 00:09:36,149
Do you want to talk about this
not-winning-the-lottery thing?

222
00:09:36,234 --> 00:09:37,192
I don't

223
00:09:37,276 --> 00:09:40,946
You sure? 'Cause you keep
talking about it, so

224
00:09:41,364 --> 00:09:44,157
Nope. I'm good
I'm here.

225
00:09:44,867 --> 00:09:46,868
Let's find some warehouse
workers Good, great.

226
00:09:46,953 --> 00:09:50,247
Then, can you say things that aren't,
like, a huge bummer to everybody?

227
00:09:51,666 --> 00:09:53,542
'Cause the more I talk the
more they're going to realize

228
00:09:53,626 --> 00:09:55,001
I don't know
what I'm talking about

229
00:09:55,086 --> 00:09:56,086
Okay

230
00:09:56,170 --> 00:09:57,754
We need you, okay?
Okay

231
00:09:57,838 --> 00:09:58,838
Okay?
Yeah

232
00:09:58,923 --> 00:09:59,965
All right

233
00:10:03,177 --> 00:10:04,177
Ah

234
00:10:06,055 --> 00:10:07,514
What's the problem?

235
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:09,641
Grunting is scientifically
proven to add more power

236
00:10:09,725 --> 00:10:11,560
Ask any female tennis player

237
00:10:11,644 --> 00:10:12,978
or her husband

238
00:10:17,275 --> 00:10:18,275
I didn't feel anything

239
00:10:20,987 --> 00:10:24,239
All right, thank you
for coming back in again.

240
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:27,492
Now, we're going to ask you a few
questions Darryl, you have the floor.

241
00:10:27,577 --> 00:10:28,743
Why do you want
to work here?

242
00:10:28,828 --> 00:10:29,953
I need a job

243
00:10:30,037 --> 00:10:31,079
It's not a good reason

244
00:10:31,163 --> 00:10:32,163
Good

245
00:10:32,498 --> 00:10:33,456
Keeping them honest

246
00:10:33,541 --> 00:10:35,500
Don't just take the first
job that comes your way

247
00:10:35,876 --> 00:10:39,462
'Cause next thing you know it's 10
years later, and you're still there

248
00:10:39,714 --> 00:10:41,798
You could write
your obituary tomorrow

249
00:10:42,008 --> 00:10:43,008
It's not going
to change.

250
00:10:44,343 --> 00:10:46,720
Are we scaring
them straight?

251
00:10:46,804 --> 00:10:47,846
I hope so

252
00:10:47,930 --> 00:10:49,097
Think about
this carefully

253
00:10:49,807 --> 00:10:51,516
There's better lives
than this one.

254
00:10:57,857 --> 00:10:59,399
I've never been lucky

255
00:10:59,483 --> 00:11:00,859
And I'm not talking
about the lottery

256
00:11:00,943 --> 00:11:05,697
I'm talking about stuff like
developing a soy allergy at 35.

257
00:11:06,365 --> 00:11:09,492
Who gets a soy allergy at /5?

258
00:11:10,286 --> 00:11:11,870
And why is soy in everything?

259
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:15,457
Nice, right back
where I like you

260
00:11:15,541 --> 00:11:17,584
Can you make 10 copies
of this for me? No

261
00:11:17,668 --> 00:11:19,044
Why not? What
are you doing?

262
00:11:19,462 --> 00:11:21,171
Buying lottery
tickets online

263
00:11:23,215 --> 00:11:26,551
Everyone wants to be rich but
nobody wants to work for it

264
00:11:27,553 --> 00:11:28,803
You came in
at 10:30 today, right?

265
00:11:28,888 --> 00:11:30,805
Okay, I'll just
do this myself

266
00:11:33,643 --> 00:11:36,478
Is everyone licensed?
Like a driver's license?

267
00:11:36,562 --> 00:11:38,104
No, warehouse license

268
00:11:39,649 --> 00:11:41,232
Masters in
warehouse sciences?

269
00:11:41,901 --> 00:11:44,653
I feel that Darryl has talked
about a license of some kind

270
00:11:44,737 --> 00:11:47,739
Is this a joke?
No. Not joking.

271
00:11:47,823 --> 00:11:49,074
This is real

272
00:11:50,159 --> 00:11:52,619
Painfully real, what
is happening right now

273
00:11:54,622 --> 00:11:57,957
Okay, I'm not going to
make it I'm turning back

274
00:11:58,918 --> 00:12:00,585
There's gotta be
a better way to do this

275
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:02,337
This is literally how
they built the pyramids

276
00:12:02,421 --> 00:12:04,547
Well, they whipped people
which was helpful.

277
00:12:04,632 --> 00:12:07,008
But you're right. We should be
able to find a more efficient way

278
00:12:07,093 --> 00:12:08,927
of moving boxes
than Madge or Hide

279
00:12:09,011 --> 00:12:10,011
Yeah

280
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:12,597
Not that they're
not smart people

281
00:12:13,224 --> 00:12:14,933
No, no, very smart

282
00:12:15,017 --> 00:12:16,476
Theirs is more of a
physical intelligence

283
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:17,560
I'd go with that

284
00:12:17,645 --> 00:12:18,853
Like baboons
or elephants.

285
00:12:18,938 --> 00:12:20,063
Not that, don't

286
00:12:20,147 --> 00:12:23,983
Guys, when I was a kid my
sisters used to butter me up

287
00:12:24,068 --> 00:12:27,737
and slide me across the
linoleum floor of the kitchen.

288
00:12:27,822 --> 00:12:29,572
It really made
them laugh.

289
00:12:29,657 --> 00:12:30,699
It's a great idea, Kev

290
00:12:30,783 --> 00:12:31,741
I don't think
it applies here, though

291
00:12:31,826 --> 00:12:32,826
So, maybe we just

292
00:12:32,910 --> 00:12:35,453
Yeah, we move stuff
and have fun.

293
00:12:35,538 --> 00:12:36,705
Kevin
doesn't apply

294
00:12:37,289 --> 00:12:38,415
Right, my mom

295
00:12:38,499 --> 00:12:41,000
You need
to drop it, okay?

296
00:12:41,085 --> 00:12:42,377
They hate it

297
00:12:42,461 --> 00:12:45,130
I like it a lot but they
hate it so drop it.

298
00:12:49,510 --> 00:12:52,595
Does anyone get distracted
easily by bubble wrap?

299
00:12:56,183 --> 00:12:59,644
You'll be dealing with lots of
bubble wrap, obviously. Um...

300
00:12:59,729 --> 00:13:01,312
How much longer
is this going to take?

301
00:13:03,649 --> 00:13:04,649
Did you hire them?

302
00:13:05,609 --> 00:13:06,985
No, because
they all left.

303
00:13:07,653 --> 00:13:08,987
What do you mean
they left?

304
00:13:09,530 --> 00:13:11,781
I mean, after you bailed

305
00:13:12,491 --> 00:13:15,160
I got confused and
frankly, a little weird

306
00:13:15,619 --> 00:13:18,621
And the stuff that you said
certainly didn't help

307
00:13:18,998 --> 00:13:20,665
Then I think you
should fire me.

308
00:13:21,876 --> 00:13:23,585
What are you talking about?
I'm not going to fire you

309
00:13:23,669 --> 00:13:25,587
Yeah, just put me out
of my misery.

310
00:13:29,508 --> 00:13:32,093
Okay, this is weird.
I don't get the joke

311
00:13:32,178 --> 00:13:33,595
No? Okay

312
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:38,183
I don't want
to be here anymore

313
00:13:39,643 --> 00:13:40,852
Fire me

314
00:13:46,525 --> 00:13:48,026
So Darryl says
to me, "Fire me, '

315
00:13:48,527 --> 00:13:50,695
but what he really means is

316
00:13:51,155 --> 00:13:53,907
"I'm going to say something really weird,
try and figure out what it means."

317
00:13:54,533 --> 00:13:57,076
So I say, "No,
you're not fired.'

318
00:13:57,161 --> 00:13:59,245
But what I really mean is

319
00:13:59,330 --> 00:14:01,748
"I've no idea what
you're talking about

320
00:14:02,625 --> 00:14:03,708
"But I'm going to go ahead
and hire some people

321
00:14:03,793 --> 00:14:06,461
"for the warehouse and hope that you
eventually start feeling better."

322
00:14:09,924 --> 00:14:11,925
I really hope that's
what he and I mean

323
00:14:13,803 --> 00:14:14,803
Attention

324
00:14:14,887 --> 00:14:16,888
Does anyone know anyone who
could work in the warehouse?

325
00:14:16,972 --> 00:14:18,014
We can pay

326
00:14:18,474 --> 00:14:19,808
Come on, Oscar

327
00:14:19,892 --> 00:14:21,893
Who's the most jacked guy
in all of Scranton?

328
00:14:21,977 --> 00:14:23,436
Like your wildest
fantasy guy?

329
00:14:23,646 --> 00:14:24,729
Bulk or definition?

330
00:14:25,022 --> 00:14:25,980
Definition

331
00:14:26,065 --> 00:14:28,191
Bruce Kenward. He hangs
out at Planet Fitness

332
00:14:28,567 --> 00:14:30,652
Are those just show muscles
or is he really strong?

333
00:14:30,736 --> 00:14:31,903
Oh, he's plenty strong

334
00:14:32,279 --> 00:14:35,490
It used to be Reggie Winters
out at Gold's Gym

335
00:14:35,574 --> 00:14:36,574
But he moved away

336
00:14:36,659 --> 00:14:39,077
And then it was between
Bruce and this guy, Dean

337
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:43,748
But Dean got fixated
on his calves,

338
00:14:43,833 --> 00:14:44,833
and, uh

339
00:14:45,793 --> 00:14:47,293
And his triceps
went to hell.

340
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,504
So, I've been thinking

341
00:14:49,588 --> 00:14:51,548
after we win the lottery
we take our winnings...

342
00:14:51,632 --> 00:14:52,632
Our fake winnings

343
00:14:52,716 --> 00:14:54,384
And we move
to the South of France

344
00:14:54,468 --> 00:14:57,387
See... No, there's plenty
of bicycling for you.

345
00:14:57,471 --> 00:14:58,638
I think that's where they
do the Tour de France

346
00:14:58,722 --> 00:14:59,764
It is, yeah

347
00:14:59,849 --> 00:15:00,974
I mean, I just don't know
why I'm compromising

348
00:15:01,058 --> 00:15:02,058
if it's my fantasy

349
00:15:02,142 --> 00:15:04,477
Because in my fantasy,
it's Maine, and you love it

350
00:15:04,562 --> 00:15:06,813
Because I'm never going to act
like that, even in your fantasy

351
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:10,775
Nope, you're doing a great job
of it in my fantasy right now

352
00:15:11,777 --> 00:15:13,528
Hey, idiot, what did
Erin want again?

353
00:15:13,612 --> 00:15:15,572
A hot chocolate tea

354
00:15:16,407 --> 00:15:20,243
Gideon, you are
a PhD candidate

355
00:15:20,327 --> 00:15:23,204
studying America's diminishing
blue-collar workforce?

356
00:15:23,289 --> 00:15:24,414
North America

357
00:15:24,498 --> 00:15:28,126
And "diminishing" is a little reductive,
but, sure that's the headline version

358
00:15:28,794 --> 00:15:29,836
Great

359
00:15:30,671 --> 00:15:33,131
Well, it will bring a fresh, new
perspective to the warehouse.

360
00:15:33,215 --> 00:15:36,384
FYI, Wednesday through Friday I have
a pretty full teaching schedule.

361
00:15:36,468 --> 00:15:38,803
Oh, cool We'll figure that out.

362
00:15:38,888 --> 00:15:40,597
Also, FYI

363
00:15:41,932 --> 00:15:45,226
I don't technically
have a hearing problem

364
00:15:45,311 --> 00:15:49,647
But sometimes, when there's a lot of
noises occurring at the same time

365
00:15:49,815 --> 00:15:51,649
I'll hear them
as one big jumble

366
00:15:52,651 --> 00:15:54,903
Again, it's not
that I can't hear

367
00:15:54,987 --> 00:15:56,654
Because that's false, I can

368
00:15:57,072 --> 00:16:00,783
Um, I just can't distinguish
between everything I'm hearing.

369
00:16:01,493 --> 00:16:03,077
Got it. Duly noted

370
00:16:03,162 --> 00:16:04,162
You

371
00:16:04,246 --> 00:16:07,248
coolest tank top I have ever seen.
Where did you get that?

372
00:16:07,333 --> 00:16:09,000
Made it.
So cool

373
00:16:09,084 --> 00:16:10,501
What a cross section
we have here.

374
00:16:10,878 --> 00:16:12,045
It's what I love
about interviewing

375
00:16:12,129 --> 00:16:13,254
I get to meet
all these people

376
00:16:13,339 --> 00:16:16,341
I wouldn't ordinarily meet,
or know or even talk to.

377
00:16:16,675 --> 00:16:18,426
Message in a Bottle,
The Postman...

378
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:20,637
Kevin Costner
Kevin Costner, yeah

379
00:16:24,808 --> 00:16:26,434
So

380
00:16:26,518 --> 00:16:27,936
I found this grease

381
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:30,438
And then I remembered that you
thought it was a great idea.

382
00:16:30,522 --> 00:16:32,357
You did say
it was a great idea

383
00:16:32,441 --> 00:16:33,524
I heard you say it

384
00:16:35,861 --> 00:16:38,404
So it's not
the dumbest idea

385
00:16:38,489 --> 00:16:39,614
It's not the
greatest one...

386
00:16:39,698 --> 00:16:41,783
But the fact remains,
we gotta move these boxes.

387
00:16:41,867 --> 00:16:43,826
And it's clear we're
not going to carry them.

388
00:16:45,245 --> 00:16:47,622
So sadly, it's the best
idea on the table. Exactly.

389
00:16:47,706 --> 00:16:50,249
Hey, I think we're
ready to get this...

390
00:16:51,251 --> 00:16:52,293
Jim?
Is he okay?

391
00:16:52,378 --> 00:16:53,544
He'll be fine

392
00:16:55,631 --> 00:16:58,549
Surprise! Your new crew

393
00:16:59,718 --> 00:17:01,052
Would you just
fire me, man?

394
00:17:02,554 --> 00:17:04,806
Hey, why? Because you
didn't win the lottery?

395
00:17:06,016 --> 00:17:07,308
How am I supposed
to make you happy?

396
00:17:07,393 --> 00:17:09,185
You want to make
me happy? Huh?

397
00:17:09,478 --> 00:17:10,436
Yeah
Give me your job.

398
00:17:10,562 --> 00:17:12,730
Haha. What? I'll do
it better than you

399
00:17:13,482 --> 00:17:15,483
I earned it,
I deserve it

400
00:17:15,567 --> 00:17:17,443
I got passed over
God knows why.

401
00:17:18,028 --> 00:17:20,446
Reasons I cannot
and will not understand

402
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:23,908
The job was mine, Andy
Everyone said it was mine

403
00:17:25,202 --> 00:17:27,495
Make me manager
or fire me.

404
00:17:27,579 --> 00:17:29,414
I'm not going
to give you my job

405
00:17:29,498 --> 00:17:31,040
It's my job
I earned it!

406
00:17:32,751 --> 00:17:34,961
And here's the thing You
weren't even next in line.

407
00:17:35,045 --> 00:17:36,796
I asked about you
I saw your file

408
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,464
You have a history of
being short with people

409
00:17:38,549 --> 00:17:40,633
and you hired Glenn
your buddy,

410
00:17:40,718 --> 00:17:42,051
to replace you
in the warehouse

411
00:17:42,177 --> 00:17:44,262
He was under-qualified
They saw that.

412
00:17:44,471 --> 00:17:46,139
Also, Darryl, FYI

413
00:17:46,223 --> 00:17:47,807
I already told
this to Andy

414
00:17:47,891 --> 00:17:49,100
but you should
probably know

415
00:17:49,184 --> 00:17:51,978
I technically don't have
a hearing problem

416
00:17:52,271 --> 00:17:55,732
It's just when there's a lot of noises...
Nate. Please.

417
00:17:57,026 --> 00:17:58,067
Thank you.

418
00:18:01,196 --> 00:18:03,072
You have no
business education

419
00:18:03,157 --> 00:18:05,908
You were going to take classes under
Deangelo What happened to that?

420
00:18:05,993 --> 00:18:07,035
He died

421
00:18:07,119 --> 00:18:08,661
He didn't die,
his brain died

422
00:18:08,746 --> 00:18:10,747
And my brain is still
very much alive

423
00:18:10,831 --> 00:18:12,874
And I'd be happy to give
you business classes

424
00:18:12,958 --> 00:18:14,375
How come you haven't
asked me about it?

425
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:15,835
What was...
What was the last

426
00:18:16,795 --> 00:18:17,879
I'm having a

427
00:18:17,963 --> 00:18:20,298
No part of this has
anything to do with you

428
00:18:21,884 --> 00:18:24,093
I didn't have time
because of my daughter

429
00:18:24,178 --> 00:18:26,095
But you had time
for a softball clinic

430
00:18:26,555 --> 00:18:27,555
And a Mediterranean
cooking class.

431
00:18:27,639 --> 00:18:30,808
Hey, I'm not going to tell you this stuff if
you're going to throw it back in my face!

432
00:18:30,893 --> 00:18:32,060
Hey, here's the thing

433
00:18:32,144 --> 00:18:34,687
Jo saw something in you
She loved you.

434
00:18:35,773 --> 00:18:38,441
She gave you a shot and
then you stopped pushing.

435
00:18:39,068 --> 00:18:40,068
She noticed

436
00:18:48,202 --> 00:18:49,243
Okay

437
00:18:49,328 --> 00:18:50,328
Okay, what?

438
00:18:52,998 --> 00:18:54,832
Okay, don't fire me

439
00:18:59,505 --> 00:19:00,505
Okay

440
00:19:01,507 --> 00:19:05,426
My future's not going to be determined
by seven little white lotto balls.

441
00:19:06,095 --> 00:19:08,721
It's going to be determined
by two big black balls.

442
00:19:09,848 --> 00:19:11,349
I control my destiny

443
00:19:12,643 --> 00:19:13,684
I do

444
00:19:14,937 --> 00:19:16,479
I'll put some
guys on tonight

445
00:19:16,563 --> 00:19:18,815
The best of your bunch
and my bunch

446
00:19:18,899 --> 00:19:21,025
I'll tell you now, though it's
going to be mostly my bunch

447
00:19:21,110 --> 00:19:22,860
Yeah, that makes sense

448
00:19:22,945 --> 00:19:24,529
Okay, good
All right.

449
00:19:24,613 --> 00:19:26,072
Are they here?

450
00:19:26,156 --> 00:19:27,698
What is going on?

451
00:19:27,783 --> 00:19:28,783
Oh, hey, guys

452
00:19:28,867 --> 00:19:30,660
Why is the forklift
in the wall?

453
00:19:30,744 --> 00:19:32,078
Why is
the truck empty?

454
00:19:32,162 --> 00:19:33,621
It's not totally empty

455
00:19:33,705 --> 00:19:34,872
Is that grease
on my floor?

456
00:19:36,416 --> 00:19:37,917
Okay

457
00:19:38,001 --> 00:19:40,086
I can see why you're angry.
You're coming into this cold

458
00:19:40,170 --> 00:19:43,798
But believe me a lot of
thought went into this.

459
00:19:43,882 --> 00:19:46,384
And did your brains tell you to
ruin these boxes with grease?

460
00:19:46,468 --> 00:19:47,885
Okay, Darryl

461
00:19:47,970 --> 00:19:50,638
Listen, and then
you will understand

462
00:19:50,722 --> 00:19:54,016
The boxes were ruined during
our first trial testing.

463
00:19:54,101 --> 00:19:56,644
So now, it's cool 'cause we
found another use for them

464
00:19:56,728 --> 00:19:58,479
Okay, all right

465
00:19:58,564 --> 00:20:01,399
That's... Look, all we were trying
to do is we thought we could come up

466
00:20:01,483 --> 00:20:03,067
with a more efficient
way to do things.

467
00:20:03,569 --> 00:20:04,610
And?

468
00:20:04,695 --> 00:20:05,820
And we did.
I don't know

469
00:20:05,904 --> 00:20:08,114
Jim, tell them
what it's called

470
00:20:08,907 --> 00:20:10,158
That's all right

471
00:20:10,242 --> 00:20:11,492
No, Jim, tell them
what the name is

472
00:20:11,577 --> 00:20:13,077
Doesn't matter
what the name is

473
00:20:14,079 --> 00:20:16,205
Señor Loadenstein
that's stupid.

474
00:20:16,290 --> 00:20:18,332
Señor Loadenstein

475
00:20:18,417 --> 00:20:20,001
Tell them why
it's called that, Jim

476
00:20:20,085 --> 00:20:21,794
That's okay, we're good

477
00:20:21,879 --> 00:20:25,256
No, Jim, tell us why it's
called señor Loadenstein

478
00:20:27,259 --> 00:20:28,509
Porque es muy rápido.

479
00:20:28,886 --> 00:20:30,845
Okay, you know what?
It's been a real busy day.

480
00:20:30,929 --> 00:20:31,971
What do you say
we put all this away?

481
00:20:32,055 --> 00:20:33,556
Let me see it

482
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:35,183
It's in beta testing

483
00:20:35,267 --> 00:20:36,434
Let me see it

484
00:20:36,518 --> 00:20:37,518
Get the thing, go

485
00:20:37,603 --> 00:20:39,896
Lube it up.
Kevin, start mopping

486
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:42,273
Uno, dos, tres.

487
00:20:46,528 --> 00:20:48,446
Yeah. I lost my client

488
00:20:50,616 --> 00:20:54,035
I already won the lottery I
was born in the US of A, baby

489
00:20:54,369 --> 00:20:56,245
And as backup,
I have a Swiss passport

490
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:59,165
I would spend
a lot of time

491
00:20:59,666 --> 00:21:02,460
launching my true crime podcast
"The Flenderson Files.'

492
00:21:02,878 --> 00:21:03,961
Duh-buh-bum

493
00:21:04,546 --> 00:21:05,963
Flenderson Files

494
00:21:06,131 --> 00:21:07,381
We came
to an agreement

495
00:21:07,466 --> 00:21:10,051
We're going to live in a
stunning pre-war brownstone

496
00:21:10,135 --> 00:21:11,260
at the top of a mountain

497
00:21:11,345 --> 00:21:12,887
Right, it's city
and country combined

498
00:21:12,971 --> 00:21:15,848
Just a subway stop away are the
best museums in the world.

499
00:21:15,933 --> 00:21:19,310
And I can fish right from the
window of Pam's pottery studio

500
00:21:19,603 --> 00:21:21,479
We can chat
any time we want

501
00:21:21,813 --> 00:21:24,482
Just like now

502
00:21:25,067 --> 00:21:27,860
It's too bad the schools are terrible,
but what are you going to do about that?

503
00:21:27,945 --> 00:21:28,945
What are you
going to do?
