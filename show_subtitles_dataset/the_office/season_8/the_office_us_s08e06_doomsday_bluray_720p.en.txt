1
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:07,778
Hey, everybody!
It's closing time

2
00:00:08,405 --> 00:00:10,698
You don't gotta go home
but you can't stay here.

3
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:18,831
Closing time!

4
00:00:19,416 --> 00:00:22,501
Every office needs an
end-of-the-day tradition

5
00:00:23,128 --> 00:00:24,628
Something to tell you
the day's over.

6
00:00:24,713 --> 00:00:27,172
Otherwise, you go home and the
night just feels like more day.

7
00:00:27,257 --> 00:00:28,298
It's weird

8
00:00:28,383 --> 00:00:29,591
Closing time!

9
00:00:29,718 --> 00:00:30,926
W, R, K

10
00:00:31,011 --> 00:00:32,761
One last call
for alcohol so...

11
00:00:32,846 --> 00:00:35,014
No, it's W, R, K
as in kitten?

12
00:00:35,098 --> 00:00:36,348
so finish your
whiskey or beer!

13
00:00:36,433 --> 00:00:37,599
Oh, my boss is
singing Closing Time,

14
00:00:37,726 --> 00:00:38,892
maybe that's
what you're hearing

15
00:00:38,977 --> 00:00:39,977
Come on, Pam

16
00:00:40,061 --> 00:00:41,729
Closing time!

17
00:00:42,605 --> 00:00:48,694
Time for you to go home
to the places you will be from

18
00:00:49,446 --> 00:00:53,115
Let's see Andy has been
manager for 105 days,

19
00:00:53,491 --> 00:00:58,287
which means I've heard
Closing Time 105 times

20
00:00:58,955 --> 00:01:01,040
Still don't know the words

21
00:01:03,043 --> 00:01:05,419
Home and home and home

22
00:01:06,421 --> 00:01:10,799
I know who I want
to take me home!

23
00:01:11,426 --> 00:01:21,101
I know who I want
to take me home

24
00:01:21,269 --> 00:01:23,020
Take me home

25
00:01:25,899 --> 00:01:28,609
You know what? Fine! I try to
start fun traditions for you guys

26
00:01:28,693 --> 00:01:31,278
but if you don't want
to sing, no traditions

27
00:01:32,197 --> 00:01:34,448
Closing time!

28
00:01:34,991 --> 00:01:36,992
Every new beginning...

29
00:01:37,202 --> 00:01:41,622
I never heard that song before and
once I heard it I did not care for it.

30
00:01:41,706 --> 00:01:44,500
But that song means
it's time to go home.

31
00:01:44,876 --> 00:01:47,419
Now, it's my favourite song

32
00:01:48,254 --> 00:01:54,968
Every new beginning comes from
some other beginning's end

33
00:01:55,303 --> 00:01:56,678
Good night

34
00:02:28,169 --> 00:02:30,587
This report is atrocious Who's
your favourite Iron Chef?

35
00:02:31,047 --> 00:02:32,506
You go first

36
00:02:34,134 --> 00:02:37,386
The ticketing software
paints a picture

37
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:41,473
of a sloppy, careless
error-prone office.

38
00:02:42,433 --> 00:02:45,227
Well, the monitoring software
is a double-edged sword.

39
00:02:45,395 --> 00:02:46,603
Sometimes the

40
00:02:46,688 --> 00:02:47,896
Sorry. Go ahead

41
00:02:48,398 --> 00:02:49,731
Mmm-hmm

42
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:53,735
Did you need
something from us?

43
00:02:54,863 --> 00:02:55,904
Yes

44
00:02:58,158 --> 00:03:00,284
Your attention
because...

45
00:03:03,329 --> 00:03:04,913
No. That is all

46
00:03:11,838 --> 00:03:14,131
Last night I dreamed
that the number two

47
00:03:14,257 --> 00:03:16,592
was the most valued
number in the world.

48
00:03:17,218 --> 00:03:19,261
The Vice President
had all the power,

49
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:21,763
athletes fought
for silver medals,

50
00:03:21,973 --> 00:03:24,016
women were considered
the best gender.

51
00:03:24,475 --> 00:03:28,228
And stadiums of fans shouted,
"We're number two!"

52
00:03:30,523 --> 00:03:32,608
As with all my dreams,
I'm guessing

53
00:03:32,775 --> 00:03:34,860
it was about
my fear of immigrants

54
00:03:35,528 --> 00:03:37,362
Last week, an accounting
mistake resulted in

55
00:03:37,447 --> 00:03:39,198
a client getting
their order for free

56
00:03:39,282 --> 00:03:41,700
Ho! That's not good

57
00:03:41,784 --> 00:03:44,286
Chalk that one up to "Tweedle-Dee'
and "Tweedle-Dum" out there

58
00:03:44,704 --> 00:03:46,622
Who are they?
They're both Kevin

59
00:03:46,748 --> 00:03:48,707
Oscar's the
Sex and the City gang,

60
00:03:48,791 --> 00:03:50,709
and Angela, if you can

61
00:03:50,793 --> 00:03:53,879
Andy, sometimes I feel like
you don't know me at all.

62
00:03:54,297 --> 00:03:55,297
I would agree with that

63
00:03:55,381 --> 00:03:57,799
Simply end the mistakes

64
00:03:58,384 --> 00:03:59,384
End the mistakes. Easy

65
00:03:59,469 --> 00:04:03,555
When I come back next week, and this
report shows me "No mistakes, '

66
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:06,433
we can talk
about names all day

67
00:04:06,809 --> 00:04:09,228
Our favourite names,
silly made-up names

68
00:04:09,312 --> 00:04:12,648
normal names said in a silly voice.
Wouldn't that be nice?

69
00:04:13,483 --> 00:04:14,483
I would like that

70
00:04:14,567 --> 00:04:16,193
End the mistakes

71
00:04:16,527 --> 00:04:18,153
That's all I ask

72
00:04:19,697 --> 00:04:21,823
And you can't have
a favorite Iron Chef

73
00:04:21,908 --> 00:04:24,952
It depends entirely on
the secret ingredient

74
00:04:25,536 --> 00:04:29,498
Sometimes I feel you
don't know food at all

75
00:04:34,337 --> 00:04:35,754
I'm just saying,
with the NBA lockout

76
00:04:35,838 --> 00:04:37,923
I think roller derby's in a
really good place right now.

77
00:04:38,007 --> 00:04:41,677
So, my pitch is, me, Pam
you and someone else

78
00:04:42,011 --> 00:04:43,387
maybe Justine

79
00:04:44,347 --> 00:04:45,973
No. Not Justine

80
00:04:46,516 --> 00:04:47,683
Never Justine

81
00:04:48,017 --> 00:04:49,059
Is that off again?

82
00:04:49,143 --> 00:04:50,227
Oh, yeah.
Okay

83
00:04:50,311 --> 00:04:53,355
Hey, mandatory warehouse
safety meeting today.

84
00:04:54,107 --> 00:04:56,233
We don't really do those
We just sign the thing.

85
00:04:56,859 --> 00:04:58,235
Are you really this lazy?

86
00:05:00,113 --> 00:05:01,488
I'll be there

87
00:05:03,032 --> 00:05:04,366
Hey
Hey

88
00:05:05,493 --> 00:05:07,160
Mondays suck

89
00:05:07,328 --> 00:05:08,662
Yeah. Yep

90
00:05:11,708 --> 00:05:13,375
Just trying to

91
00:05:16,045 --> 00:05:19,715
I may have a little solution
to our mistakes problem.

92
00:05:20,675 --> 00:05:23,010
This is a project I've been
working on for quite some time.

93
00:05:23,094 --> 00:05:25,137
And today might be
the day to use it.

94
00:05:25,221 --> 00:05:26,263
What've you got?

95
00:05:26,889 --> 00:05:28,140
Allow me

96
00:05:31,811 --> 00:05:33,729
You're gonna love this

97
00:05:35,565 --> 00:05:36,773
Should've used
a shorter string.

98
00:05:36,899 --> 00:05:38,108
Never mind
I know it by heart

99
00:05:38,318 --> 00:05:42,446
It is a system that holds people
accountable for everyone else's work.

100
00:05:42,905 --> 00:05:43,989
Sounds controversial

101
00:05:44,407 --> 00:05:45,949
Have I not been
worthy of your trust?

102
00:05:46,909 --> 00:05:49,077
Have I not been
a reliable number two?

103
00:05:49,412 --> 00:05:51,038
Do not go there

104
00:05:52,081 --> 00:05:54,291
You're the deuce
I never want to drop

105
00:05:54,542 --> 00:05:56,835
Well, I can make this work

106
00:05:56,919 --> 00:05:58,879
I'll set it up right now.
I just need your go ahead

107
00:05:59,172 --> 00:06:01,840
Go do the voodoo
that you do so we

108
00:06:01,924 --> 00:06:02,966
I will do my voodoo

109
00:06:03,051 --> 00:06:04,217
Mmm-hmm

110
00:06:05,511 --> 00:06:07,262
Hey. I need you to get
the paperwork rolling

111
00:06:07,388 --> 00:06:09,097
on a new
workplace relationship

112
00:06:09,182 --> 00:06:10,182
For you?

113
00:06:10,266 --> 00:06:11,224
Yes, for Gabe

114
00:06:11,309 --> 00:06:12,476
Who are you seeing?
That's great

115
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:15,937
Whom I am seeing is Val,
from down in the warehouse

116
00:06:16,564 --> 00:06:18,565
I'm not technically
seeing her

117
00:06:18,691 --> 00:06:20,692
but, I've seen
her with the eyes

118
00:06:20,777 --> 00:06:24,071
And there was attraction in
at least one direction, so...

119
00:06:26,616 --> 00:06:29,618
You know, I don't have to do paperwork
unless you're actually dating.

120
00:06:30,119 --> 00:06:32,496
Okay. Well, once this starts
it's gonna be moving fast,

121
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:34,122
it's gonna be hot and heavy
and I don't want

122
00:06:34,207 --> 00:06:35,707
a bunch of
bureaucratic red tape

123
00:06:35,792 --> 00:06:37,250
wrapped around my jock
you know?

124
00:06:37,502 --> 00:06:39,836
But I mean, well, have
you talked to her?

125
00:06:39,921 --> 00:06:42,672
Yeah. We had a whole
conversation about Mondays

126
00:06:43,174 --> 00:06:45,258
Do you know
her last name yet?

127
00:06:45,343 --> 00:06:47,344
Toby, I'm gonna tell you
her last name tomorrow

128
00:06:47,428 --> 00:06:49,388
because she's gonna be
screaming it tonight.

129
00:06:49,472 --> 00:06:51,390
She's gonna be screaming
her own last name?

130
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:53,350
Hey, watch it

131
00:06:54,602 --> 00:06:56,019
Good luck, Gabe

132
00:06:56,312 --> 00:06:57,479
Hi, guys
Hi.

133
00:06:57,563 --> 00:07:01,733
I just wanna say that you all have
been doing amazing work, really.

134
00:07:01,818 --> 00:07:03,610
Thank you.
And I'd like to add

135
00:07:03,694 --> 00:07:05,529
that your work has
been a little sloppy

136
00:07:05,655 --> 00:07:08,323
So, Dwight and I
have implemented

137
00:07:08,449 --> 00:07:11,118
a new program that
we like to call...

138
00:07:11,786 --> 00:07:12,911
Dwight?

139
00:07:13,037 --> 00:07:14,204
The Accountability Booster

140
00:07:14,664 --> 00:07:17,749
It registers every time a mistake
has been made in the office,

141
00:07:17,834 --> 00:07:20,669
from a late delivery
to an accounting error

142
00:07:20,795 --> 00:07:24,172
Five strikes in a day
equals a home run

143
00:07:24,257 --> 00:07:26,007
One home run
and you're out

144
00:07:26,759 --> 00:07:29,845
If we as a group make
five mistakes in a day

145
00:07:29,971 --> 00:07:33,348
something bad happens
Like, we block Minesweeper

146
00:07:33,516 --> 00:07:36,268
Or, in this case, an e-mail
gets sent to Robert California

147
00:07:36,352 --> 00:07:38,103
containing the consultant's
report from last year.

148
00:07:38,187 --> 00:07:40,522
Remember the one that recommended
the branch be shut down?

149
00:07:40,606 --> 00:07:42,691
What?
And, as a failsafe, also

150
00:07:42,775 --> 00:07:45,861
every negative e-mail you've ever
written about him to the group

151
00:07:45,945 --> 00:07:47,070
will also be
forwarded to him

152
00:07:47,155 --> 00:07:48,488
What e-mails are
you talking about?

153
00:07:48,573 --> 00:07:52,909
Robert's favorite songs, Creep
by TLC Creep by Radiohead.

154
00:07:52,994 --> 00:07:54,536
You remember that one, Jim?

155
00:07:55,037 --> 00:07:57,831
"There's no way he hasn't
strangled at least one stripper.'

156
00:07:57,915 --> 00:07:59,082
Oscar

157
00:07:59,542 --> 00:08:02,961
"He eats his yogurt like he is
punishing it for disappointing him.'

158
00:08:03,045 --> 00:08:04,129
Kelly

159
00:08:04,213 --> 00:08:05,213
That's not that
bad, actually.

160
00:08:05,715 --> 00:08:07,048
PS, "We should
kill him."

161
00:08:08,217 --> 00:08:10,677
Wait. So, you installed
a doomsday device?

162
00:08:10,761 --> 00:08:12,471
No, it's an
Accountability Booster

163
00:08:12,555 --> 00:08:14,639
Which, when it goes off
it destroys everything

164
00:08:14,724 --> 00:08:16,057
very similar to
a doomsday device

165
00:08:16,142 --> 00:08:18,977
Jim, you're trying to make me sound
like some kind of evil maniac

166
00:08:19,061 --> 00:08:22,022
No, the point is, is that we are
now working in an environment

167
00:08:22,106 --> 00:08:25,400
where we have accountability
to each other

168
00:08:25,568 --> 00:08:28,278
I am confident that you
guys are equal to the task

169
00:08:28,779 --> 00:08:32,324
No, we're not. And you are a
psycho who is ruining our lives

170
00:08:32,408 --> 00:08:34,075
We can't do this, Dwight.
We can't

171
00:08:35,411 --> 00:08:36,745
Smile

172
00:08:37,079 --> 00:08:38,788
Nod. Smile and nod

173
00:08:39,081 --> 00:08:41,166
They're making me out
to be a Bond villain.

174
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:43,919
I like to think of myself
as a brilliant scientist

175
00:08:44,086 --> 00:08:46,796
who will stop at nothing
to remake the world.

176
00:08:47,381 --> 00:08:48,465
Like

177
00:08:50,092 --> 00:08:52,427
Not Doctor Moreau
someone good

178
00:08:53,971 --> 00:08:56,056
Doctor Frankenstein

179
00:08:56,140 --> 00:08:58,099
Doctor Jekyll, not them

180
00:08:59,977 --> 00:09:01,603
Doctor

181
00:09:05,107 --> 00:09:07,150
Are you sure
this is a good idea?

182
00:09:07,235 --> 00:09:10,237
I mean, the thing about this office
is we make a lot of mistakes

183
00:09:10,446 --> 00:09:12,405
But the device
will change that

184
00:09:12,490 --> 00:09:14,824
Without a safety net
people will improve.

185
00:09:18,955 --> 00:09:21,623
All right, everybody, looks like
we need to be getting to work.

186
00:09:21,707 --> 00:09:24,501
Be extra careful,
double-check everything

187
00:09:24,627 --> 00:09:26,670
Or the Accountability Booster
will get you.

188
00:09:26,754 --> 00:09:30,048
This doomsday device sounds
like a scare tactic to me.

189
00:09:30,132 --> 00:09:32,717
There's an easy way to tell
if this device is a sham,

190
00:09:32,802 --> 00:09:34,678
we just make a mistake

191
00:09:35,012 --> 00:09:38,265
I'll send an order down to shipping
before we've received payment

192
00:09:45,565 --> 00:09:47,399
There's one mistake

193
00:09:47,483 --> 00:09:49,484
Now we only have four strikes
left until a home run.

194
00:09:49,569 --> 00:09:51,653
Dwight's our co-worker
and he worked really hard

195
00:09:51,737 --> 00:09:53,113
on this doomsday
device. So, I...

196
00:09:53,197 --> 00:09:55,740
it's not a doomsday
device! Gosh!

197
00:09:56,826 --> 00:09:58,493
We can do this, you guys

198
00:09:59,078 --> 00:10:00,161
First

199
00:10:00,246 --> 00:10:01,746
Second
it's not a race.

200
00:10:04,292 --> 00:10:05,417
Third

201
00:10:06,002 --> 00:10:07,294
Who knows
what the belt is for?

202
00:10:07,378 --> 00:10:08,753
It's for
protecting my ass

203
00:10:08,838 --> 00:10:10,505
when you suckers lift
more than you can handle.

204
00:10:10,923 --> 00:10:11,965
What's up? I'm Gabe

205
00:10:12,508 --> 00:10:14,009
Corporate. Continue

206
00:10:14,218 --> 00:10:15,468
Don't be nervous

207
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:17,012
Apparently,
we have a visitor

208
00:10:17,096 --> 00:10:18,096
Gabe, everyone

209
00:10:18,347 --> 00:10:19,347
Hi, Gabe

210
00:10:20,182 --> 00:10:22,892
All right so the support belt.
Now this one is mine

211
00:10:22,977 --> 00:10:24,686
Doesn't get much
use nowadays.

212
00:10:24,854 --> 00:10:26,605
Look at this.
This is enormous

213
00:10:30,067 --> 00:10:33,194
I get the sense that Val
enjoys a good put-down

214
00:10:33,362 --> 00:10:35,196
Considering that's the only
thing I know about her,

215
00:10:35,323 --> 00:10:37,699
I will be milking that hard

216
00:10:38,451 --> 00:10:40,201
It's like a hula-hoop
right?

217
00:10:40,745 --> 00:10:44,122
Mele Kalikimaka
is Hawaii's way

218
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:47,959
You done?

219
00:10:48,044 --> 00:10:50,712
The Michelin Man called,
he wants his cummerbund back

220
00:10:52,173 --> 00:10:55,175
Remember, we have to get Regal
Escrow their refund by 5:00.

221
00:10:55,593 --> 00:10:56,593
I'm on it

222
00:10:56,761 --> 00:10:58,887
Kevin, maybe I
should handle that.

223
00:10:59,263 --> 00:11:01,848
We really need you to
focus on your project.

224
00:11:02,058 --> 00:11:03,308
Good thinking

225
00:11:03,392 --> 00:11:06,394
Apparently a big client
for this company

226
00:11:06,479 --> 00:11:09,564
needs to know the story
of how paper gets made

227
00:11:12,401 --> 00:11:14,778
Oscar, use a calculator

228
00:11:18,491 --> 00:11:22,202
When the stakes are this high there's
only one computer that I trust

229
00:11:22,536 --> 00:11:25,580
And it's powered by
Thai food and Spanish reds

230
00:11:26,123 --> 00:11:27,374
All right, everybody
you're doing great.

231
00:11:27,458 --> 00:11:30,335
Well, I wouldn't say that. Three
mistakes already is pretty terrible

232
00:11:30,419 --> 00:11:31,628
But I do see
improvement

233
00:11:31,712 --> 00:11:33,421
Meredith kept someone
on hold for 30 minutes,

234
00:11:33,506 --> 00:11:35,548
and now look
she's hard at work

235
00:11:36,592 --> 00:11:38,009
Dwight, question.
No questions

236
00:11:38,094 --> 00:11:39,594
If this doomsday
device goes off

237
00:11:39,679 --> 00:11:40,762
Accountability Booster

238
00:11:40,888 --> 00:11:41,971
If this bad idea goes off

239
00:11:42,056 --> 00:11:44,516
and we all lose our jobs, are
you gonna feel good about that?

240
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:45,892
I haven't even
considered it

241
00:11:45,976 --> 00:11:49,354
That's how sure I am that this
Accountability Booster is gonna work

242
00:11:50,106 --> 00:11:51,481
Try "Mose-1-2-3-4.'

243
00:11:51,565 --> 00:11:53,733
Dwight would never be that
obvious Try something like...

244
00:11:53,818 --> 00:11:56,695
"Z-6-4-$-8.'

245
00:11:57,279 --> 00:11:59,698
Not that exactly, Jim
something like that

246
00:11:59,782 --> 00:12:00,740
Okay

247
00:12:00,825 --> 00:12:03,368
How about
"Scranton-Strangler-6-6-6"?

248
00:12:04,704 --> 00:12:05,787
Nope
No?

249
00:12:05,871 --> 00:12:07,038
Aw...

250
00:12:07,123 --> 00:12:08,623
Shoot.

251
00:12:08,749 --> 00:12:11,334
You guys are never gonna
shut down the machine, okay?

252
00:12:11,585 --> 00:12:13,670
But I appreciate your energy
and your teamwork

253
00:12:13,754 --> 00:12:15,422
You apply this to
your regular work

254
00:12:15,506 --> 00:12:17,048
you won't even notice
that the device is there

255
00:12:17,133 --> 00:12:18,550
watching you
ready to strike

256
00:12:21,011 --> 00:12:22,345
What's Dwight's
mother's name?

257
00:12:22,972 --> 00:12:24,139
Hedda

258
00:12:26,851 --> 00:12:27,851
No

259
00:12:27,935 --> 00:12:29,978
Once you've read
the packet, sign the back

260
00:12:30,062 --> 00:12:31,730
Hey, Darryl.
I was thinking

261
00:12:31,814 --> 00:12:33,148
maybe while we
read through this

262
00:12:33,315 --> 00:12:34,691
you could grab us
all some coffee?

263
00:12:35,025 --> 00:12:36,317
My treat

264
00:12:37,027 --> 00:12:38,445
Here's a $100 bill

265
00:12:38,529 --> 00:12:40,113
That should cover it
I think.

266
00:12:40,239 --> 00:12:42,449
Don't bring me any of that
caramel soy latte crap, okay?

267
00:12:42,533 --> 00:12:44,826
I want a decaf
frappuccino.

268
00:12:44,910 --> 00:12:45,910
Val?

269
00:12:45,995 --> 00:12:47,996
Actually, Val
why don't you come with?

270
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:49,998
I'll need the extra hands
to carry them back.

271
00:12:50,082 --> 00:12:51,082
Yeah, sure

272
00:12:51,167 --> 00:12:52,292
Mmm-hmm

273
00:12:53,586 --> 00:12:54,627
Caramel soy latte

274
00:12:54,754 --> 00:12:55,795
No, a decaf frap

275
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:57,088
Got it

276
00:12:59,717 --> 00:13:02,594
You sent the late notice to
Rinehart and Wolfe, right?

277
00:13:03,179 --> 00:13:04,345
Mmm-hmm. 64620

278
00:13:07,683 --> 00:13:08,933
Nuh-uh.
Yes

279
00:13:09,018 --> 00:13:10,977
588 plus 15%

280
00:13:13,773 --> 00:13:15,690
Oh, no!
- What does this mean?

281
00:13:16,066 --> 00:13:17,609
What does it mean?
- Andy.

282
00:13:17,693 --> 00:13:18,943
Oh

283
00:13:20,404 --> 00:13:21,488
God

284
00:13:21,822 --> 00:13:22,947
That's five strikes

285
00:13:23,532 --> 00:13:24,616
Well

286
00:13:25,367 --> 00:13:28,870
I was saving this for my
retirement which I guess is today

287
00:13:28,996 --> 00:13:30,163
Dwight, we got
five strikes.

288
00:13:31,791 --> 00:13:32,874
Really?

289
00:13:33,042 --> 00:13:34,125
Did the e-ma
go out or...

290
00:13:34,210 --> 00:13:35,668
It goes out automatically
at 5:00 p.m

291
00:13:35,753 --> 00:13:37,754
Well, then there's
gotta be a way to stop it

292
00:13:37,922 --> 00:13:40,381
Well, I would have to enter my
password in order to cancel it.

293
00:13:40,758 --> 00:13:41,883
Okay

294
00:13:41,967 --> 00:13:44,344
Dwight, you may now
enter your password.

295
00:13:44,970 --> 00:13:45,970
No

296
00:13:46,055 --> 00:13:47,138
What?
What?

297
00:13:47,223 --> 00:13:49,057
You don't deserve
to have this branch

298
00:13:49,141 --> 00:13:51,851
Five mistakes in
less than a day?

299
00:13:51,936 --> 00:13:53,144
We did our best

300
00:13:53,229 --> 00:13:54,979
No, you didn't, Phyllis

301
00:13:55,064 --> 00:13:56,481
You complained
the whole time,

302
00:13:56,565 --> 00:13:58,858
you yelled at me you tried
to break into the machine.

303
00:14:00,069 --> 00:14:01,152
What?

304
00:14:01,237 --> 00:14:03,029
You're a real crumb bum
you know that?

305
00:14:03,113 --> 00:14:05,114
Hey, you can't
just change the rules

306
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:07,158
because you don't
like the outcome.

307
00:14:07,243 --> 00:14:09,953
What about you, Kevin? What
about you and your fake task?

308
00:14:10,037 --> 00:14:12,080
Can you tell me now
where paper comes from?

309
00:14:13,332 --> 00:14:15,583
The man tree
puts its penis

310
00:14:15,709 --> 00:14:17,669
Okay. All right, Andy,
back me up here, please

311
00:14:17,753 --> 00:14:18,753
No

312
00:14:19,004 --> 00:14:20,004
What?
No

313
00:14:20,089 --> 00:14:22,757
Dwight, be human for once
shut down the machine.

314
00:14:22,842 --> 00:14:24,634
Shut it down
Shut it down.

315
00:14:24,718 --> 00:14:26,010
Shut down the machine

316
00:14:26,095 --> 00:14:27,345
Shut it down

317
00:14:29,056 --> 00:14:31,599
good luck finding
a new job, idiots

318
00:14:31,725 --> 00:14:34,269
I'll make sure to write
you a glowing reference

319
00:14:34,353 --> 00:14:36,104
Glowingly negative

320
00:14:38,899 --> 00:14:40,066
Dwight's car is gone

321
00:14:40,734 --> 00:14:41,693
I bet he went home

322
00:14:41,777 --> 00:14:44,571
Some of us should go there, try
to talk some sense into him.

323
00:14:44,655 --> 00:14:46,447
Get him to stop that e-mail

324
00:14:46,532 --> 00:14:49,450
Pam, you should come with
me. Dwight really likes you,

325
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:51,536
and your breasts are
enormous, that could help us

326
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:53,788
Kevin has that lovability

327
00:14:54,248 --> 00:14:55,748
Guys, come on

328
00:14:56,125 --> 00:14:57,208
I'm right here

329
00:14:57,293 --> 00:15:00,128
Jim, I want you to go find Robert.
Just be where he is

330
00:15:00,212 --> 00:15:02,589
in case that e-ma
goes out at 5:00,

331
00:15:02,673 --> 00:15:04,966
you can try to
delete it or something

332
00:15:05,050 --> 00:15:06,217
Okay. Where is he?

333
00:15:06,302 --> 00:15:09,470
He's at some club where you
either eat squash or play squash

334
00:15:10,848 --> 00:15:12,348
I'll try both

335
00:15:13,309 --> 00:15:14,559
Oh

336
00:15:14,643 --> 00:15:16,811
Did you come to
reason with me?

337
00:15:17,187 --> 00:15:18,438
Got you something

338
00:15:23,235 --> 00:15:26,654
And I just really
want to talk to you

339
00:15:26,822 --> 00:15:28,114
Get lost

340
00:15:28,282 --> 00:15:29,741
Well, now hold on

341
00:15:29,825 --> 00:15:30,867
What are you doing?

342
00:15:32,077 --> 00:15:33,453
What does it
look like I'm doing?

343
00:15:33,537 --> 00:15:34,996
Digging a grave
for a horse

344
00:15:38,334 --> 00:15:39,375
Do you need a hand?

345
00:15:40,836 --> 00:15:42,670
Yeah, you need a hand?

346
00:15:49,428 --> 00:15:52,055
If you hit another horse
you've dug too far

347
00:15:52,723 --> 00:15:54,933
I'll see you
next week, Will.

348
00:15:55,142 --> 00:15:56,351
Robert

349
00:15:57,019 --> 00:15:58,728
Jim, what are you

350
00:15:58,812 --> 00:15:59,854
What a surprise

351
00:15:59,939 --> 00:16:02,815
Yeah. Well, you know I just had
a meeting, a squash meeting

352
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:04,025
Yeah?

353
00:16:05,361 --> 00:16:06,402
You up for a game?

354
00:16:06,487 --> 00:16:07,862
A game? Or a match?

355
00:16:09,031 --> 00:16:10,782
Exactly! Here we go

356
00:16:11,033 --> 00:16:12,033
Let's do it

357
00:16:17,039 --> 00:16:18,790
Are you okay, Kevin?

358
00:16:22,294 --> 00:16:23,294
Where are you going?

359
00:16:23,379 --> 00:16:24,837
In. I'm hungry

360
00:16:25,047 --> 00:16:27,674
Could we come in, too?
Just for some water?

361
00:16:28,342 --> 00:16:29,884
Okay. Take off your shoes

362
00:16:29,969 --> 00:16:32,011
Except you, Kevin
They stay on

363
00:16:34,556 --> 00:16:37,225
Wow, I forgot how
pretty your house is

364
00:16:37,685 --> 00:16:41,437
This is the newest addition,
built by Erasmus Schrute in 1808

365
00:16:41,522 --> 00:16:44,607
It doubled as a tuberculosis
recovery room until 2009.

366
00:16:46,902 --> 00:16:49,112
That's too much doodle
and not enough lab

367
00:16:49,196 --> 00:16:51,948
Yeah, when are they gonna do a
Labradoodle that's just lab?

368
00:16:52,032 --> 00:16:53,908
That's what I'm saying

369
00:16:58,330 --> 00:16:59,414
Hey

370
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:01,791
You're welcome.
Thanks for the coffee

371
00:17:01,875 --> 00:17:04,460
So, tonight I was thinking,
I'm gonna go to the cemetery

372
00:17:04,545 --> 00:17:05,837
I'm gonna drink
a little wine

373
00:17:05,921 --> 00:17:07,755
and I thought maybe you'd
like to come with me

374
00:17:08,507 --> 00:17:09,966
Are you asking me
on a date?

375
00:17:10,509 --> 00:17:11,884
Yes, I am

376
00:17:12,094 --> 00:17:13,428
Because I don't
date coworkers

377
00:17:13,637 --> 00:17:15,888
it's not personal.
It's a matter of policy

378
00:17:16,223 --> 00:17:17,348
I could quit

379
00:17:17,433 --> 00:17:18,433
Problem solved

380
00:17:18,517 --> 00:17:19,892
Don't quit

381
00:17:21,937 --> 00:17:23,896
Good policy
It's sensible

382
00:17:23,981 --> 00:17:25,148
Smart

383
00:17:26,942 --> 00:17:28,568
All right. Serving

384
00:17:28,652 --> 00:17:30,153
Serving, serving, serving

385
00:17:30,404 --> 00:17:32,363
In the box.
In the box

386
00:17:39,621 --> 00:17:41,748
Why haven't
we heard anything?

387
00:17:41,832 --> 00:17:44,625
It's 4:45 There's
only 15 minutes left

388
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:46,961
Oh, now you
can do math?

389
00:17:47,171 --> 00:17:48,963
Where were you two hours
ago beautiful mind?

390
00:17:49,048 --> 00:17:50,715
I made a mistake
I'm sorry!

391
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:52,884
I know how to save
the company, everyone

392
00:17:53,302 --> 00:17:56,387
Just write a petition,
get everyone's signature

393
00:17:56,472 --> 00:18:00,725
including our clients,
march down to Florida

394
00:18:00,809 --> 00:18:02,060
and shove it up your butt

395
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:05,938
it's not that funny

396
00:18:17,493 --> 00:18:18,993
Pam, you got something
on your shirt.

397
00:18:19,787 --> 00:18:21,579
Oh!

398
00:18:21,663 --> 00:18:24,999
Well, pobody's
nerfect, right?

399
00:18:25,334 --> 00:18:28,127
Did you just have a stroke, Pam?
It's "nobody's perfect.'

400
00:18:28,754 --> 00:18:29,921
Nice stroke, Pam

401
00:18:30,005 --> 00:18:32,215
No, it's a jokey saying

402
00:18:32,299 --> 00:18:33,758
"Pobody's nerfect.'

403
00:18:33,842 --> 00:18:36,010
Like, I can't even
say those words right

404
00:18:37,346 --> 00:18:38,805
I hadn't heard that before

405
00:18:39,473 --> 00:18:40,932
That's funny

406
00:18:42,142 --> 00:18:43,518
Dwight, there's just the small

407
00:18:43,602 --> 00:18:47,021
You know what would go so
great with this cabbage pie?

408
00:18:47,314 --> 00:18:48,272
Milk

409
00:18:48,357 --> 00:18:49,607
Any specific animal?

410
00:18:50,025 --> 00:18:52,443
I'm thinking cow
Don't say cow.

411
00:18:53,987 --> 00:18:56,114
What are you doing?
It's five to 5:00

412
00:18:56,198 --> 00:18:58,783
Just don't talk
about the e-mail, okay?

413
00:18:58,867 --> 00:19:01,327
He's gonna cancel it on his
own I really think he will.

414
00:19:01,411 --> 00:19:03,329
That's insane
Just trust me.

415
00:19:03,413 --> 00:19:05,248
Trust you? Like I trusted
Dwight this morning?

416
00:19:05,332 --> 00:19:06,666
I got this

417
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:13,339
Thanks for everything

418
00:19:13,423 --> 00:19:14,799
Sive drafely

419
00:19:19,012 --> 00:19:21,639
Wasn't it supposed
to be drive safely?

420
00:19:25,727 --> 00:19:26,936
Is that my phone?

421
00:19:28,605 --> 00:19:29,814
Sounded like mine

422
00:19:29,898 --> 00:19:32,900
No, I think it's mine Let me
just check real quick here

423
00:19:32,985 --> 00:19:34,235
All right

424
00:19:34,319 --> 00:19:37,071
No, it's mine.
You took it out of my bag

425
00:19:37,489 --> 00:19:39,031
Oh. Oops

426
00:19:39,116 --> 00:19:40,950
Yeah
Can I have it?

427
00:19:41,076 --> 00:19:42,118
Yes

428
00:19:43,829 --> 00:19:44,829
Right now?

429
00:19:44,913 --> 00:19:45,913
Yes
There you go

430
00:19:45,998 --> 00:19:47,874
Whoa! No! Wait, wait

431
00:19:48,584 --> 00:19:49,584
What the *?

432
00:19:49,668 --> 00:19:50,668
Oh, man
I'm sorry!

433
00:19:50,752 --> 00:19:52,545
Jesus!
Did it break?

434
00:19:53,005 --> 00:19:54,839
No, it's good, thanks.
You sure?

435
00:19:54,923 --> 00:19:56,090
Yeah

436
00:19:56,258 --> 00:19:57,425
What kind of
iPhone is that?

437
00:19:58,927 --> 00:20:00,636
It's the standard one,
the one everyone has

438
00:20:00,721 --> 00:20:03,097
Yeah. I have the one
that nobody has.

439
00:20:03,182 --> 00:20:05,349
Is there anything
interesting?

440
00:20:05,434 --> 00:20:07,768
It depends, Jim.
Do you find one-day-only

441
00:20:07,936 --> 00:20:10,271
JetBlue sales to
Buffalo interesting?

442
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:14,775
No, I don't

443
00:20:18,739 --> 00:20:19,947
All right

444
00:20:20,699 --> 00:20:24,535
Well, I am sore and
obviously horrible at this

445
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:25,912
My serve

446
00:20:31,293 --> 00:20:33,002
Dwight stopped the device

447
00:20:33,795 --> 00:20:34,837
Yes

448
00:20:37,549 --> 00:20:39,050
He stopped it

449
00:20:39,885 --> 00:20:40,885
Yes

450
00:20:40,969 --> 00:20:42,303
We still have our jobs

451
00:20:42,679 --> 00:20:44,388
They're not my favorite
people in the world

452
00:20:44,514 --> 00:20:46,140
I wouldn't even
call them friends.

453
00:20:46,225 --> 00:20:48,643
They come over here,
eat my pie,

454
00:20:48,727 --> 00:20:51,687
dig the crappiest horse grave
you've ever seen.

455
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:55,524
God, I'm gonna have to work
with them forever, aren't I?

456
00:20:57,653 --> 00:21:00,029
Just take it easy
Nice and easy

457
00:21:02,658 --> 00:21:03,658
Classic, right?

458
00:21:14,169 --> 00:21:15,336
Ooh

459
00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:16,879
I'm all right.
You all right?

460
00:21:17,005 --> 00:21:18,422
Yeah.
Skinned knee

461
00:21:18,507 --> 00:21:19,590
Yeah

462
00:21:22,302 --> 00:21:23,761
Need a little ice
on that, maybe.

463
00:21:23,845 --> 00:21:26,514
Yeah. That does
not feel good.

464
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,224
Okay. My serve
