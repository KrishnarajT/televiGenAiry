1
00:00:01,521 --> 00:00:04,106
Okay. Bye

2
00:00:08,611 --> 00:00:11,530
Everyone, stop what you're
doing I have terrible news

3
00:00:12,323 --> 00:00:13,574
Dwight is
no longer with us

4
00:00:13,908 --> 00:00:14,908
What?
What?

5
00:00:15,326 --> 00:00:16,869
He's gone, damn it

6
00:00:18,955 --> 00:00:21,373
He's been promoted to
V.P. of Sabre Retail

7
00:00:21,458 --> 00:00:22,750
and he's staying
in Florida forever

8
00:00:24,002 --> 00:00:25,544
So, he's alive?

9
00:00:25,795 --> 00:00:29,048
Yeah. That was him on the
phone He sounds wonderful.

10
00:00:29,257 --> 00:00:31,633
Well, the way you said it made
it sound like he was dead

11
00:00:31,885 --> 00:00:33,802
How could I have
been more clear?

12
00:00:33,887 --> 00:00:36,263
He had a massive
stroke of good fortune

13
00:00:36,347 --> 00:00:38,474
and he is now in
a better place.

14
00:00:38,725 --> 00:00:41,477
If Dwight's not coming back does
that mean we can open his treasure?

15
00:00:42,353 --> 00:00:45,689
You guys we've gone over
this there is no treasure

16
00:00:45,899 --> 00:00:47,608
When the team
left for Tallahassee

17
00:00:47,692 --> 00:00:50,277
Dwight told everyone
not to touch his treasure

18
00:00:50,528 --> 00:00:52,112
Don't touch my treasure

19
00:00:52,697 --> 00:00:53,906
Okay? You understand?

20
00:00:54,282 --> 00:00:56,825
Obviously he wants us to obsess
about it There's nothing in there

21
00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:01,288
Which is obviously what he
would want us to think,

22
00:01:01,372 --> 00:01:03,999
making it the perfect
place to hide a treasure

23
00:01:04,334 --> 00:01:07,044
Oh, God, I'm Wallace Shawn
in The Princess Bride.

24
00:01:07,504 --> 00:01:09,338
Wanted us to realize

25
00:01:09,422 --> 00:01:12,800
that this conversation among
friends is the true treasure.

26
00:01:13,593 --> 00:01:14,593
No, no, no

27
00:01:15,762 --> 00:01:17,346
I am dying to
know what's in there

28
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:20,265
Yeah, I know, Oscar. We all are.
But nobody's going to open it

29
00:01:20,350 --> 00:01:21,558
You'd have to be insane

30
00:01:24,562 --> 00:01:25,562
Hi. Hello

31
00:01:28,358 --> 00:01:31,401
Now carefully open the box

32
00:01:35,865 --> 00:01:37,658
It's a photo of all of us

33
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:41,036
Oh, that's so sweet

34
00:01:43,414 --> 00:01:45,791
A dart?
Are you kidding me?

35
00:01:45,875 --> 00:01:49,586
Who would put a poison dart Well, I
mean, I don't know that it's poisoned

36
00:01:52,173 --> 00:01:54,633
God, I'm glad
he's okay though

37
00:01:54,717 --> 00:01:56,009
Kind of sounds
like he deserved it

38
00:01:56,094 --> 00:01:58,595
opening another man's
treasure and all. Wow

39
00:02:20,368 --> 00:02:25,038
Well, Mister Ball it's been a
pleasure Now, give my regards to he

40
00:02:26,916 --> 00:02:30,544
All right!
Well swung by VIPVP

41
00:02:31,087 --> 00:02:33,422
I am loving the chemistry
between you two

42
00:02:33,506 --> 00:02:36,341
Dwight is going to be
working alongside me

43
00:02:36,426 --> 00:02:40,304
We are a regular Archibald
and his man George

44
00:02:42,849 --> 00:02:46,685
Trick! There's no such thing
It's not even a real English duo

45
00:02:46,769 --> 00:02:47,769
Ah

46
00:02:47,896 --> 00:02:52,733
I just made you look like the Goat of
Dover. And that doesn't exist either

47
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:56,653
You think you're excited?
You should feel my nipples

48
00:02:57,447 --> 00:02:58,447
Pong

49
00:02:59,115 --> 00:03:02,117
Oh, that reminds me Little
something from all of us.

50
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:05,579
Oh, my gosh. Thank you, Jim
That's so thoughtful.

51
00:03:10,793 --> 00:03:13,879
Fore! Oh, yeah

52
00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:16,006
He doesn't even care

53
00:03:17,884 --> 00:03:19,468
This is the last time
I'll ever see Dwight.

54
00:03:20,178 --> 00:03:22,221
It's a weird feeling
It's, um...

55
00:03:23,806 --> 00:03:27,476
What's the word?
It's not "bittersweet.'

56
00:03:28,269 --> 00:03:30,270
It's "sweet." Yeah

57
00:03:31,314 --> 00:03:33,523
Hey, man.
Selling cookies for Jada

58
00:03:33,608 --> 00:03:35,067
You want
the same as last year?

59
00:03:35,235 --> 00:03:37,194
Would if I could
and I can so I will

60
00:03:37,278 --> 00:03:40,822
Put me down for one box Don't
care what it is. Dealer's choice.

61
00:03:41,491 --> 00:03:43,075
I'll put you down
for shortbreads

62
00:03:43,326 --> 00:03:44,576
Damn it

63
00:03:45,161 --> 00:03:47,204
Knock, knock. Hey

64
00:03:47,372 --> 00:03:48,664
It's Sasha's
first year in the troop

65
00:03:48,748 --> 00:03:49,998
so I'm selling
cookies for her

66
00:03:50,333 --> 00:03:51,375
Anyway, would you
like some?

67
00:03:51,501 --> 00:03:53,669
No. No
What?

68
00:03:54,212 --> 00:03:56,505
I've been selling here for
five years This is my spot.

69
00:03:57,006 --> 00:04:00,801
You can't claim territories This is
the only place I interact with people

70
00:04:01,135 --> 00:04:04,179
Why can't you sell it
at your church or barbershop?

71
00:04:07,016 --> 00:04:08,350
Or chess club?

72
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:12,479
You know what? It's your first
time we'll split the office

73
00:04:13,314 --> 00:04:17,109
You can have Sales the Annex,
Creed and I don't know.

74
00:04:17,193 --> 00:04:19,319
I'll just take Accounting

75
00:04:19,779 --> 00:04:23,532
That's it?
Yeah. Well, okay

76
00:04:24,033 --> 00:04:25,909
Thanks, Darryl
Okay, great

77
00:04:27,495 --> 00:04:29,037
All I need is Kevin.

78
00:04:29,122 --> 00:04:31,498
Dude buys more cookies
than everyone combined.

79
00:04:31,582 --> 00:04:32,791
And then some.

80
00:04:33,001 --> 00:04:36,044
When I first started selling cookies,
he was a relatively thin man

81
00:04:36,129 --> 00:04:39,756
Not a thin man, mind you
Relatively thin.

82
00:04:41,384 --> 00:04:44,761
Hey, Lucy, I'm home
Babaloo

83
00:04:45,263 --> 00:04:46,263
Here, let me help

84
00:04:46,556 --> 00:04:51,018
so busy at the store today
Really good cheese nibbles

85
00:04:52,228 --> 00:04:54,146
Irene hired me as
her live-in helper

86
00:04:54,564 --> 00:04:56,064
We met at
the store launch.

87
00:04:56,149 --> 00:04:58,817
I told her I was moving here
and I needed a place

88
00:04:58,901 --> 00:05:00,569
and it just
sort of made sense.

89
00:05:00,737 --> 00:05:02,279
I basically do
everything for her.

90
00:05:02,363 --> 00:05:04,698
I run errands, I do chores
around the house.

91
00:05:04,824 --> 00:05:06,116
I cook and clean.

92
00:05:06,409 --> 00:05:08,910
Honestly, I don't know
how she survived without me

93
00:05:09,537 --> 00:05:14,708
When can I introduce you to my grandson?
He's a wonderful swimmer

94
00:05:14,792 --> 00:05:17,502
Shallow end, deep end
He does it all

95
00:05:17,587 --> 00:05:20,005
Well, today might be
kind of tough, Irene

96
00:05:20,089 --> 00:05:21,673
I have to talk to
my old boss, Andy

97
00:05:21,758 --> 00:05:23,258
and tell him I'm
staying in Florida

98
00:05:29,098 --> 00:05:31,099
Oh! What kind
of tea is this?

99
00:05:31,517 --> 00:05:32,934
Oh, I boiled some Gatorade

100
00:05:37,607 --> 00:05:38,940
Oh
Oh!

101
00:05:40,276 --> 00:05:44,279
In England, they put the holes a
little bit to the right you see.

102
00:05:44,364 --> 00:05:45,947
We'll just chalk it up
to cultural bias.

103
00:05:46,074 --> 00:05:47,157
If I may

104
00:05:48,326 --> 00:05:54,414
Try holding the putter you
know, with your wrists here,

105
00:05:54,707 --> 00:05:56,750
and your thumbs here

106
00:05:57,293 --> 00:05:58,293
Oh

107
00:05:58,461 --> 00:06:01,004
That's right
Your little finger

108
00:06:02,131 --> 00:06:03,465
Would you like to
buy some cookies?

109
00:06:05,009 --> 00:06:06,343
Cookies, eh?

110
00:06:06,469 --> 00:06:07,636
Mmm-hmm
Hmm

111
00:06:07,887 --> 00:06:11,056
Oh, the spring time
thinks that it's the best

112
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:13,934
And fall time
thinks that it's the best

113
00:06:14,018 --> 00:06:16,728
Cold time has
kind of a strut

114
00:06:16,813 --> 00:06:19,689
And Valentine's
thinks that it's the best

115
00:06:19,774 --> 00:06:22,567
But gather round, peeps
I'll tell you the truth

116
00:06:22,652 --> 00:06:25,445
Nothing beats the cookie
season That's the truth

117
00:06:30,827 --> 00:06:32,577
It's not
a scratch and sniff, Kev

118
00:06:32,787 --> 00:06:35,539
I know. But sometimes you
still get a little something

119
00:06:35,832 --> 00:06:38,083
Hey, you tricked me
You just wanted Kevin

120
00:06:38,334 --> 00:06:40,752
You're new to the game.
You learned a lesson today

121
00:06:40,837 --> 00:06:42,129
See you next year, sport

122
00:06:42,338 --> 00:06:45,173
No, no, no, that's not fair What if
Kevin wants to buy cookies from me?

123
00:06:45,299 --> 00:06:46,716
I do
See?

124
00:06:46,843 --> 00:06:50,429
That doesn't mean anything Kevin,
do you want to buy cookies from me?

125
00:06:50,513 --> 00:06:52,097
Oh, I definitely do

126
00:06:52,181 --> 00:06:54,057
Huh. Hit the road, Jack

127
00:06:54,142 --> 00:06:55,976
No, you hit the road, Jack

128
00:06:56,310 --> 00:06:59,855
Hey, guys, come on
Don't fight over me.

129
00:07:00,356 --> 00:07:02,023
Why don't we split the order?
It's only fair

130
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:05,152
No, wait, no. I'm buying.
I make the rules

131
00:07:05,236 --> 00:07:08,071
I actually do want
you to fight over me

132
00:07:08,156 --> 00:07:12,451
wined and dined
and sixty-nined

133
00:07:12,702 --> 00:07:13,827
Ugh

134
00:07:14,871 --> 00:07:18,957
Metaphorically sixty-nined
Ew! Perverts

135
00:07:20,209 --> 00:07:21,418
No offense, Oscar

136
00:07:23,629 --> 00:07:27,215
Hop in! We have places to be!
No rest for the wicked

137
00:07:27,758 --> 00:07:31,303
All right
so I guess this is it

138
00:07:31,888 --> 00:07:35,056
Well, Jim, I just want to say that
we haven't always gotten along

139
00:07:35,433 --> 00:07:37,309
And, at times, I've even
hated your guts, but

140
00:07:41,397 --> 00:07:42,898
Bye, bye. I win

141
00:07:44,984 --> 00:07:45,984
Good-bye, Dwight

142
00:07:46,611 --> 00:07:49,404
Robert! Race you to the
clubhouse Gentleman's bet!

143
00:07:49,572 --> 00:07:50,739
Whoo-hoo

144
00:07:56,037 --> 00:07:58,205
Well, he's
Florida's problem now

145
00:07:58,706 --> 00:08:00,540
Oh, let Dwight
have his fun.

146
00:08:00,625 --> 00:08:02,792
Today will not be his day

147
00:08:02,877 --> 00:08:03,960
What's that?

148
00:08:04,086 --> 00:08:05,504
I'm going to
tank the Sabre store

149
00:08:05,588 --> 00:08:06,838
at the presentation
to the board

150
00:08:07,131 --> 00:08:08,173
I thought you
liked the store

151
00:08:08,257 --> 00:08:10,342
No, the store is lovely

152
00:08:10,426 --> 00:08:14,721
You created a wonderful space
to showcase our product line

153
00:08:14,805 --> 00:08:16,264
Great job. Cheers

154
00:08:17,475 --> 00:08:18,600
Thank you

155
00:08:19,602 --> 00:08:24,356
But there's a reason we sell our
products online and over the phone

156
00:08:25,274 --> 00:08:27,275
Have you ever used
Sabre electronics, Jim?

157
00:08:27,610 --> 00:08:29,569
They're cheap,
they're unintuitive

158
00:08:29,904 --> 00:08:31,196
The Sabre store
would work

159
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,822
if we adopted
the carnival mode

160
00:08:32,907 --> 00:08:34,783
of leaving town once
everyone's wise to us

161
00:08:35,576 --> 00:08:38,954
Wow. When you put it that way, I
guess it does sound pretty terrible

162
00:08:39,330 --> 00:08:42,958
I couldn't just kill the project from
the start Jo Bennett endorsed it.

163
00:08:43,751 --> 00:08:45,544
Shame, though.
I did like Dwight

164
00:08:46,462 --> 00:08:51,132
Robert, I'm going to win! Ha-ha!
I'm the gentleman Suck it!

165
00:08:51,259 --> 00:08:53,593
Bravo, Dwight
Very good!

166
00:08:56,138 --> 00:08:57,138
Shame

167
00:08:59,475 --> 00:09:00,976
DWIGHT
The math is simple, folks

168
00:09:01,143 --> 00:09:05,855
Deeper market penetration plus greater
visibility will raise Sabre...

169
00:09:06,816 --> 00:09:08,858
To the power of two
To the power of two

170
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,279
How did that look?

171
00:09:12,363 --> 00:09:13,363
I'm not just
saying this,

172
00:09:13,781 --> 00:09:15,782
that was the best
thing I've ever seen

173
00:09:16,659 --> 00:09:17,659
Told you

174
00:09:17,827 --> 00:09:19,869
When you guys do that whole
"power of two" shebang

175
00:09:20,329 --> 00:09:21,788
how about I pop up also?

176
00:09:21,998 --> 00:09:24,791
Say "power of three.'

177
00:09:24,875 --> 00:09:27,836
Actually you know what?
Yeah, that actually works

178
00:09:28,129 --> 00:09:29,588
You'd spin off right
I'd spin off

179
00:09:29,672 --> 00:09:31,047
You know what?
That is a great idea

180
00:09:31,132 --> 00:09:32,549
Cathy, write that down
and print it out

181
00:09:32,633 --> 00:09:33,925
It's going to make some
really good toilet paper

182
00:09:34,343 --> 00:09:35,802
All right.
There he is

183
00:09:36,053 --> 00:09:37,512
What are you doing here?
I thought I got rid of you.

184
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,180
Can I just talk to you
for one quick second?

185
00:09:39,515 --> 00:09:41,683
What? Your stylist
ran out of messy spray?

186
00:09:43,352 --> 00:09:45,937
Um, actually, it's for your
own good I think we should...

187
00:09:46,022 --> 00:09:47,272
You want to do
something for my own good?

188
00:09:47,356 --> 00:09:48,607
Turn around,
walk out that door

189
00:09:48,691 --> 00:09:49,941
Do not stop until
you get to Scranton

190
00:09:50,026 --> 00:09:52,694
Find my cell phone charger mail
it back to me and then go to hell

191
00:09:55,698 --> 00:09:59,909
Nice. Hey, Halpert, anyone ever
tell you you look like Wooly Willy?

192
00:10:00,828 --> 00:10:01,828
Silence

193
00:10:02,204 --> 00:10:03,580
I'm just trying to

194
00:10:03,664 --> 00:10:05,290
I know what
you're trying to do

195
00:10:08,044 --> 00:10:10,670
But your face does look like
the guy from Operation.

196
00:10:12,715 --> 00:10:15,091
It's the same guy.
That's the joke I made

197
00:10:15,176 --> 00:10:16,551
Different guy
You know what

198
00:10:16,719 --> 00:10:17,719
I just think
you should know

199
00:10:17,803 --> 00:10:20,055
That you look like
the world's tallest hobbit

200
00:10:23,643 --> 00:10:27,604
Well, I tried. You saw it
So, it's on the record.

201
00:10:30,107 --> 00:10:33,652
Can you help me? I'm trying to
make a video chat with Andy

202
00:10:33,736 --> 00:10:35,987
Just open the program
and type in his username

203
00:10:36,072 --> 00:10:37,489
Can you just do it?

204
00:10:42,578 --> 00:10:44,079
You type in your password

205
00:10:44,747 --> 00:10:47,040
Erin, one, two, three

206
00:10:47,458 --> 00:10:49,167
That's a terrible password

207
00:10:49,251 --> 00:10:50,835
And you don't
make a video chat

208
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:52,087
You video chat.
All right

209
00:10:58,094 --> 00:10:59,094
Hello.

210
00:10:59,428 --> 00:11:01,554
That's so weird. There's
something wrong with my laptop

211
00:11:02,765 --> 00:11:03,848
Oh

212
00:11:08,270 --> 00:11:09,771
Now mine's broken
Hang on.

213
00:11:13,275 --> 00:11:15,193
Oh, there we go

214
00:11:17,446 --> 00:11:19,864
He said "I did like Dwight"?
He's going to fire him.

215
00:11:19,949 --> 00:11:21,324
No, no, no, I think it was more like

216
00:11:21,409 --> 00:11:23,159
"I liked him,
but I don't anymore

217
00:11:23,244 --> 00:11:25,704
"because he did a bad job so I'm
definitely going to yell at him."

218
00:11:25,788 --> 00:11:26,871
Robert doesn't
talk like that.

219
00:11:26,956 --> 00:11:28,456
You have to stop Dwight
from doing this.

220
00:11:28,541 --> 00:11:30,500
He will not listen

221
00:11:30,584 --> 00:11:32,127
Did you actually
try your hardest?

222
00:11:32,211 --> 00:11:35,130
Yes. My pretty hardest

223
00:11:35,923 --> 00:11:37,799
Look, you haven't dealt with
him in a while, all right?

224
00:11:37,883 --> 00:11:38,967
He's like Super Dwight

225
00:11:39,051 --> 00:11:42,595
It's like he's been bitten by a
radioactive Dwight or something

226
00:11:42,722 --> 00:11:43,763
Stanley, back me up

227
00:11:43,848 --> 00:11:44,973
Don't talk to me

228
00:11:45,057 --> 00:11:46,808
Stanley's very upset
that we're leaving Florida

229
00:11:46,892 --> 00:11:48,268
but he would back me up

230
00:11:48,352 --> 00:11:51,438
If Dwight's about to get
fired, you have to tell him.

231
00:11:51,522 --> 00:11:53,648
Just get the words out,
that's all you can do.

232
00:11:53,816 --> 00:11:55,775
Okay. All right

233
00:11:56,819 --> 00:11:59,279
What's a skinny guy like Toby
know about cookies?

234
00:11:59,363 --> 00:12:00,572
You can't trust
him to understand

235
00:12:00,656 --> 00:12:02,741
the wants and needs
of the thick man

236
00:12:02,825 --> 00:12:04,325
Maybe Toby from
two years ago.

237
00:12:04,410 --> 00:12:05,744
Yeah
That's true

238
00:12:05,828 --> 00:12:07,996
If I have a question about
my cookies at midnight

239
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,330
who am I going to call?

240
00:12:09,707 --> 00:12:13,293
Darryl Toby's probably
in bed with some model.

241
00:12:13,544 --> 00:12:14,544
Thank you

242
00:12:14,628 --> 00:12:16,254
I'm not going to comment
on my personal life

243
00:12:16,756 --> 00:12:20,467
Look, I need this. Okay, your
daughter is a pretty little girl.

244
00:12:20,551 --> 00:12:22,343
Let her go door to door

245
00:12:22,428 --> 00:12:26,765
You think people are going to buy
cookies from my chubby daughter?

246
00:12:27,183 --> 00:12:28,183
Ooh

247
00:12:28,893 --> 00:12:32,103
Baby, if you're watching this you're
not chubby. You're beautiful.

248
00:12:32,188 --> 00:12:34,355
Daddy's just got to
sell some cookies

249
00:12:35,858 --> 00:12:38,777
And we're also going to exercise
more It's going to be fun.

250
00:12:39,528 --> 00:12:41,196
Oh. You know what you
have to do to decide?

251
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:43,448
You need to make them do things
for you and buy you things

252
00:12:43,741 --> 00:12:47,202
Or have them sing that song that
the frog does in Looney Tunes.

253
00:12:47,286 --> 00:12:48,745
Make them kiss each other

254
00:12:49,455 --> 00:12:50,830
Make them kiss me

255
00:12:51,791 --> 00:12:52,874
Ew

256
00:12:55,044 --> 00:12:56,836
Yes, this is, too, tan

257
00:12:57,213 --> 00:12:58,671
This right here.
No

258
00:12:58,756 --> 00:13:00,965
This is a tan spot.

259
00:13:01,050 --> 00:13:04,677
I don't buy it. And that is a freckle.
That is not a tan, okay?

260
00:13:04,762 --> 00:13:07,222
I'm going to have to inspect it
in person when you get back here

261
00:13:07,431 --> 00:13:11,684
I want you looking totally
Puertorriquena when I see you.

262
00:13:12,478 --> 00:13:14,437
Well, Andy,
I'm not coming back

263
00:13:15,481 --> 00:13:16,481
What?

264
00:13:16,941 --> 00:13:19,776
I have a job here.
I work for an old lady.

265
00:13:20,694 --> 00:13:21,694
Hello.

266
00:13:22,947 --> 00:13:23,947
Andy?

267
00:13:24,657 --> 00:13:27,158
Yeah, that's awesome
That's great

268
00:13:28,577 --> 00:13:32,205
Oh, baby, telephone

269
00:13:32,289 --> 00:13:37,669
And tell me I'm your own

270
00:13:39,046 --> 00:13:41,005
Okay, this is tough
because Darryl,

271
00:13:41,090 --> 00:13:43,383
you sang better and
you danced better

272
00:13:43,759 --> 00:13:46,970
but Toby has that indescribable
quality that makes a star.

273
00:13:49,098 --> 00:13:51,266
I think I've
reached my decision

274
00:13:51,350 --> 00:13:56,062
I've decided that you guys are
going to keep doing things for me.

275
00:13:56,397 --> 00:13:58,982
No, no, no, no
It's not worth it

276
00:13:59,149 --> 00:14:00,191
No

277
00:14:00,276 --> 00:14:02,610
No, it's not worth it?
That's too bad

278
00:14:02,695 --> 00:14:05,280
Because I was feeling
particularly hungry this year.

279
00:14:05,781 --> 00:14:07,657
Yeah, okay, so what?
You buy 40 boxes?

280
00:14:08,325 --> 00:14:09,325
Hungrier

281
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:11,160
50?

282
00:14:11,954 --> 00:14:13,204
Hungrier

283
00:14:13,622 --> 00:14:16,749
You're not
talking triple digits?

284
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:19,002
Oh, yeah
I'm talking triple digits

285
00:14:22,464 --> 00:14:23,464
Again

286
00:14:24,383 --> 00:14:26,718
Hello, ma baby
Hello, ma honey

287
00:14:26,802 --> 00:14:29,012
Hello, ma ragtime gal

288
00:14:30,848 --> 00:14:31,890
It's show time

289
00:14:31,974 --> 00:14:32,974
Dwight

290
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:36,019
You again? Gosh, I keep throwing
you away you keep flying back

291
00:14:36,103 --> 00:14:37,604
You're like
an Amish return stick

292
00:14:37,730 --> 00:14:39,230
Okay, great, listen
listen to me.

293
00:14:39,481 --> 00:14:40,648
No, no, no, no

294
00:14:40,733 --> 00:14:42,150
Will you just let me
tell you one thing, please?

295
00:14:42,276 --> 00:14:43,693
Yes, you may tell
me one thing Great

296
00:14:43,819 --> 00:14:45,153
Wait, do you want to borrow money?
Listen to me

297
00:14:45,237 --> 00:14:46,988
Robert is going to
veto the Sabre store

298
00:14:47,072 --> 00:14:48,156
Jim, come on

299
00:14:48,157 --> 00:14:49,908
Dwight, he's going to kill the store.
Mmm-hmm.

300
00:14:49,992 --> 00:14:52,160
And then I'm pretty sure
he's going to fire you for it

301
00:14:52,661 --> 00:14:56,664
Wait he's going to kill the store
and he's going to fire me?

302
00:14:56,832 --> 00:14:57,832
Yes

303
00:14:58,208 --> 00:14:59,208
That's two things

304
00:14:59,293 --> 00:15:00,919
Dwight, please
Nice try, Jim.

305
00:15:01,003 --> 00:15:02,253
Your pranks have
never worked in the past

306
00:15:02,338 --> 00:15:03,755
and they're not
going to work today

307
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:04,964
Okay, first of all
they've mostly worked so

308
00:15:05,049 --> 00:15:06,758
You know what? You might
want to get to the airport.

309
00:15:06,842 --> 00:15:08,551
It's going to take you a long
time to get through security

310
00:15:08,636 --> 00:15:11,012
with all those
beauty products Bye

311
00:15:11,513 --> 00:15:12,513
Dwight, come on

312
00:15:13,098 --> 00:15:16,100
Nothing is going to stop me
That is the mark of a great man

313
00:15:16,185 --> 00:15:18,061
Unstoppability

314
00:15:18,145 --> 00:15:24,025
Dunder Mifflin, the farm Mose, all those
things vanish in my rearview mirror

315
00:15:25,653 --> 00:15:28,780
Now, if you'll excuse me I
have a date with destiny

316
00:15:28,864 --> 00:15:30,740
And from what I hear
she's a

317
00:15:34,453 --> 00:15:36,663
Help! Help

318
00:15:36,914 --> 00:15:40,333
Gross, don't lick my hand God,
why is there so much saliva?

319
00:15:40,417 --> 00:15:41,626
All I had to do
was think about pie

320
00:15:41,710 --> 00:15:42,919
and my salivary glands
did the rest.

321
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:44,295
Gross! What?
What? What? What?

322
00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:46,589
Oh, God, Jim!
Oh! My appendix

323
00:15:46,674 --> 00:15:47,715
I'm sorry

324
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:49,509
My wound hasn't healed yet.
I'm so sorry I'm sorry.

325
00:15:49,635 --> 00:15:51,135
Oh, man. I'm so sorry I forgot.

326
00:15:51,303 --> 00:15:53,096
Are you all right?
Are you okay?

327
00:15:57,351 --> 00:16:00,144
Where the hell is he?
I cannot do this without him

328
00:16:00,229 --> 00:16:01,437
He's not picking up

329
00:16:04,692 --> 00:16:06,818
Looks like
Shnoot's a no-show

330
00:16:06,902 --> 00:16:09,821
Guess he wasn't vice
prezzy material after all

331
00:16:09,905 --> 00:16:11,155
But I am

332
00:16:11,490 --> 00:16:12,740
Put me in, babe

333
00:16:13,158 --> 00:16:16,452
I've got the info down backwards,
forwards and doggy style.

334
00:16:16,537 --> 00:16:17,578
I'm your man

335
00:16:20,332 --> 00:16:21,582
Right.
Let's begin then

336
00:16:22,292 --> 00:16:24,544
Ladies and gentlemen
allow me to introduce

337
00:16:24,628 --> 00:16:29,173
the vice president of Sabre
Retail, Mister Todd Packer

338
00:16:30,592 --> 00:16:31,926
What's up?

339
00:16:41,186 --> 00:16:42,186
What are you doing?

340
00:16:42,730 --> 00:16:44,522
I'm just dealing
with Erin's stuff

341
00:16:44,606 --> 00:16:46,357
since apparently
she's not coming back

342
00:16:46,442 --> 00:16:47,650
and she didn't
bother to tell anyone

343
00:16:48,027 --> 00:16:49,569
We knew.
Ryan told us

344
00:16:51,572 --> 00:16:52,613
Ryan, why didn't you
tell me?

345
00:16:52,781 --> 00:16:53,990
Thought you
checked my Tumblr

346
00:16:54,825 --> 00:16:55,950
You never update it

347
00:16:56,326 --> 00:16:57,535
Well, I updated it

348
00:16:58,871 --> 00:17:01,205
Does anyone else
think this is weird?

349
00:17:01,290 --> 00:17:03,458
Like, kind of
uncool, actually?

350
00:17:03,542 --> 00:17:04,834
To leave us without
a receptionist?

351
00:17:05,127 --> 00:17:06,878
We'll find
another receptionist

352
00:17:07,004 --> 00:17:08,796
I mean, that's easy
We'll be fine

353
00:17:14,011 --> 00:17:15,887
What are you doing?
I'm just trying to.

354
00:17:15,971 --> 00:17:17,096
Get up. Get up

355
00:17:17,181 --> 00:17:18,556
Okay. Okay

356
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:19,974
All right? I'm not
going to let you by.

357
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:23,227
Then you know what? I'm going to
just have to run right through you

358
00:17:23,312 --> 00:17:25,521
Okay
What are you doing?

359
00:17:26,315 --> 00:17:27,982
Are you really revving up?
You know that doesn't work

360
00:17:29,151 --> 00:17:30,151
Jackie Chan

361
00:17:33,030 --> 00:17:34,447
Go

362
00:17:34,531 --> 00:17:35,907
Hi, this is Alex.

363
00:17:36,241 --> 00:17:37,992
And this is Sam.

364
00:17:38,077 --> 00:17:42,163
"Kevin can't come to the phone right
now because he's busy with us.'

365
00:17:42,456 --> 00:17:43,539
Perfect

366
00:17:43,624 --> 00:17:46,209
Now people w think I'm
doing hot girls all day

367
00:17:47,002 --> 00:17:48,669
They might think
we're drag queens

368
00:17:48,796 --> 00:17:51,380
Yeah, I don't know why you picked
names that were also guys' names

369
00:17:51,548 --> 00:17:53,925
Okay, now who do I ride to
the kitchen like a pony?

370
00:17:54,134 --> 00:17:55,510
Don't make me be
your pony, Kevin.

371
00:17:56,095 --> 00:17:57,178
Forget it, man

372
00:17:57,513 --> 00:18:00,181
What do you mean?
I'm out. So is Toby.

373
00:18:00,599 --> 00:18:02,308
This may be wrong
but there's a limit

374
00:18:02,392 --> 00:18:04,060
to what I will do
for my child.

375
00:18:04,144 --> 00:18:06,020
Yeah.
I have my dignity, too

376
00:18:07,439 --> 00:18:09,315
another man's horsey

377
00:18:10,067 --> 00:18:13,528
No, guys, stop! You
have to sell me cookies

378
00:18:14,113 --> 00:18:15,488
I'll do anything

379
00:18:16,698 --> 00:18:18,908
Hello, my baby
Hello, my honey

380
00:18:18,992 --> 00:18:20,451
I'm even going
to kiss Meredith

381
00:18:25,958 --> 00:18:27,041
Mmm

382
00:18:27,334 --> 00:18:29,210
That's so good

383
00:18:32,214 --> 00:18:33,798
What are you doing?
No, no, no, no!

384
00:18:33,882 --> 00:18:36,008
This ends now
This is dangerous.

385
00:18:36,176 --> 00:18:37,593
Thunder slam

386
00:18:37,719 --> 00:18:39,220
No

387
00:18:44,685 --> 00:18:46,227
Anything else you
need to talk about?

388
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:48,312
Nope. That was it

389
00:18:55,863 --> 00:18:58,614
Once again,
it's show time

390
00:19:01,410 --> 00:19:06,164
What baffles me is how you could
take a perfectly good idea

391
00:19:06,248 --> 00:19:09,584
which the great Jo Bennett
rightfully signed off on

392
00:19:09,668 --> 00:19:12,420
and then, utterly
botch it in execution

393
00:19:13,088 --> 00:19:14,755
If I may speak to that

394
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:16,591
I have only
been vice president

395
00:19:16,675 --> 00:19:18,342
of this project for
the last half-hour

396
00:19:18,427 --> 00:19:20,595
so the man you want
is Dwight Schrute.

397
00:19:20,721 --> 00:19:22,555
I don't see Dwight

398
00:19:22,639 --> 00:19:24,098
He clearly had
the infinite wisdom

399
00:19:24,183 --> 00:19:27,435
to stay as far away from
this clown show as possible.

400
00:19:27,936 --> 00:19:32,899
Whatever you do,
do not blame Todd Packer

401
00:19:33,317 --> 00:19:35,443
It is not his fault

402
00:19:36,111 --> 00:19:39,113
Blame his upbringing
His parents

403
00:19:39,239 --> 00:19:42,700
The society that would
mold this idiotic creature

404
00:19:42,784 --> 00:19:44,785
Fire the employee, yes

405
00:19:45,746 --> 00:19:46,746
But not the man

406
00:19:47,456 --> 00:19:50,208
You may not
cancel his soul

407
00:19:50,459 --> 00:19:51,792
That was never
on the table.

408
00:19:52,377 --> 00:19:53,628
Are you kidding?

409
00:19:54,254 --> 00:19:56,005
She's the queen of the
whole frigging magilla.

410
00:19:56,173 --> 00:19:58,716
And yet, Todd,
it's you who's fired

411
00:19:59,134 --> 00:20:02,178
Wait, I can't get fired
I'm an institution.

412
00:20:02,346 --> 00:20:04,180
Company for 20 years

413
00:20:04,264 --> 00:20:06,015
How many of you have
been here that long? Huh?

414
00:20:27,996 --> 00:20:29,997
Hey, hey, they're back

415
00:20:31,083 --> 00:20:33,834
Hi! Oh, my gosh!
Look at you guys

416
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:34,961
Dwight, what are you
doing here?

417
00:20:35,045 --> 00:20:36,462
I thought you were
supposed to be in Florida

418
00:20:36,546 --> 00:20:38,881
Yeah, the crazy thing
about that is, um...

419
00:20:39,174 --> 00:20:41,175
Wow, you look great.
Did you lose some weight?

420
00:20:41,677 --> 00:20:44,220
Thank you. For someone
who actually noticed this

421
00:20:44,346 --> 00:20:46,764
no, I didn't lose weight
but I started using my makeup

422
00:20:46,848 --> 00:20:48,099
to contour my face
to look skinnier.

423
00:20:48,183 --> 00:20:49,517
I actually put on
five pounds

424
00:20:50,852 --> 00:20:52,520
Hey, good to
have you back

425
00:20:52,604 --> 00:20:53,938
Good to be back

426
00:20:56,233 --> 00:20:58,067
Hey, stranger
Hey

427
00:20:58,610 --> 00:21:00,152
Oh, I missed you
I missed you.

428
00:21:03,907 --> 00:21:05,199
Oh

429
00:21:08,036 --> 00:21:09,453
I'm going to Florida
to get Erin.

430
00:21:15,544 --> 00:21:18,170
Forgot to turn off my email
It's crazy, right?

431
00:21:18,255 --> 00:21:19,463
It's just when she
said she was leaving

432
00:21:19,548 --> 00:21:21,924
"You're about to
close four tabs,

433
00:21:22,009 --> 00:21:23,092
"are you sure you
want to continue?'

434
00:21:23,176 --> 00:21:24,677
Yes, I am sure

435
00:21:26,221 --> 00:21:28,389
Ah! Slow computer
