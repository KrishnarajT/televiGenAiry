1
00:00:04,441 --> 00:00:05,733
Approved

2
00:00:07,736 --> 00:00:10,779
Chef from South Park. It's genius.
Just some chef.

3
00:00:11,531 --> 00:00:14,616
I've decided to pre-screen all of
the Halloween costumes this year

4
00:00:14,701 --> 00:00:15,909
I have three simple rules

5
00:00:15,994 --> 00:00:18,120
don't be offensive
don't be cliché

6
00:00:18,204 --> 00:00:20,956
and don't take the first
two rules too seriously

7
00:00:22,208 --> 00:00:25,002
The gorilla from Rise of
the Planet of the Apes.

8
00:00:25,295 --> 00:00:26,295
Huh?

9
00:00:26,379 --> 00:00:28,589
The one who
sacrifices his life

10
00:00:28,673 --> 00:00:29,840
Whoa! Oh

11
00:00:29,924 --> 00:00:32,718
Spoiler alert It's been
out for ages, man.

12
00:00:33,053 --> 00:00:34,595
Costume vetoed

13
00:00:36,389 --> 00:00:37,389
Uh.

14
00:00:37,474 --> 00:00:40,100
It's... Somebody's
already called that

15
00:00:40,643 --> 00:00:43,395
Who? Kevin has a gorilla
suit you could borrow.

16
00:00:43,646 --> 00:00:46,231
This is ridiculous! Why can't there
just be two Kate Middletons?

17
00:00:46,316 --> 00:00:49,401
Guys, I know, I mean I
wish there could be too

18
00:00:49,486 --> 00:00:51,945
It's like I can't choose

19
00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:53,906
They're both
amazing, it's just

20
00:00:53,990 --> 00:00:56,742
Look, I stayed up all night and
I watched that g. D. wedding

21
00:00:56,826 --> 00:00:58,994
and then I came to work and I made
everyone else watch it all day

22
00:00:59,079 --> 00:01:01,747
Meredith wasn't even here
Because I was there

23
00:01:01,831 --> 00:01:05,793
You're the people's princess!
Diana was nothing!

24
00:01:06,044 --> 00:01:07,669
I thought you were
at your sister's funeral

25
00:01:07,754 --> 00:01:11,215
What I said was "My sister's
funeral is this weekend.'

26
00:01:11,299 --> 00:01:12,424
Didn't say
I'd be there

27
00:01:12,509 --> 00:01:15,344
Why is it such a shock
that I follow the royal story?

28
00:01:16,137 --> 00:01:19,389
Warms my heart thinking
about them two kids...

29
00:01:20,433 --> 00:01:21,975
doing it

30
00:01:51,631 --> 00:01:54,424
Can I maybe
squeeze through?

31
00:01:55,552 --> 00:01:58,762
Here you go
There we go. Thank you.

32
00:01:59,305 --> 00:02:02,015
When they talk about app the nice
things about dating a co-worker,

33
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:04,017
they don't mention
one of the best parts.

34
00:02:04,102 --> 00:02:07,855
After you're done dating, you still
get to work together every single day

35
00:02:10,066 --> 00:02:11,984
Jim, put it on

36
00:02:12,235 --> 00:02:14,027
Put it on, man

37
00:02:14,154 --> 00:02:16,989
I don't know if I can.
Come on the Three Amigos

38
00:02:17,073 --> 00:02:19,158
Three Kings.
All right

39
00:02:19,409 --> 00:02:22,244
I know, I know, I know. But
Darryl and Kevin needed a third.

40
00:02:22,412 --> 00:02:24,663
They bought me
this jersey. I said no

41
00:02:24,747 --> 00:02:28,417
Kevin started crying, so
I am Chris Bosh.

42
00:02:29,752 --> 00:02:32,337
If you get into season
one, you know, really

43
00:02:32,422 --> 00:02:34,590
Oh, my God, what the he
is wrong with you?

44
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,009
It's called a costume

45
00:02:37,093 --> 00:02:38,760
What are you? Some kind
of Jamaican zombie woman?

46
00:02:39,095 --> 00:02:41,513
Ryan, will you please tell her who I am?
Whoopi Goldberg.

47
00:02:41,598 --> 00:02:44,766
Has no one here heard
of Kerrigan, from StarCraft?

48
00:02:45,435 --> 00:02:47,019
Queen of blades

49
00:02:49,022 --> 00:02:50,355
It's all Toby's fault

50
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:52,191
Every Halloween,
I tell him the same thing

51
00:02:52,275 --> 00:02:54,109
You can't bring weapons
into the office.

52
00:02:54,611 --> 00:02:56,236
And every year he says
the same thing.

53
00:02:56,321 --> 00:02:58,822
"As soon as I get my weapons
back, I'm going to kill you."

54
00:02:59,490 --> 00:03:02,576
But there I am at
Thanksgiving alive, you know?

55
00:03:03,119 --> 00:03:05,204
I'm a lucky turkey

56
00:03:08,374 --> 00:03:11,293
Everybody looking good?
This is the best we can do?

57
00:03:12,587 --> 00:03:15,088
I'm not judging. I think you
guys look great, I just

58
00:03:17,217 --> 00:03:18,884
want to make sure this
is the best we can do

59
00:03:19,093 --> 00:03:21,470
I just got a text
from Broccoli Rob. "Boo!'

60
00:03:22,388 --> 00:03:23,722
It scared me

61
00:03:23,806 --> 00:03:26,225
And then I got this text
from Robert California

62
00:03:26,309 --> 00:03:29,102
"Looking forward to Halloween
party Expectations are high.'

63
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:32,522
Scared the ♪
out of me

64
00:03:33,733 --> 00:03:36,401
G'day, Pameroo Could you
shoot this off for me?

65
00:03:36,486 --> 00:03:38,362
Yeah.
Australian accent

66
00:03:43,826 --> 00:03:45,911
What are you doing? I just
wanted to see how you do it.

67
00:03:45,995 --> 00:03:47,412
If you're doing
something I don't

68
00:03:53,503 --> 00:03:56,255
Are you That Andy
so hot and cold

69
00:03:56,339 --> 00:03:58,298
One day he's like,
"Fax these documents, please.'

70
00:03:58,383 --> 00:04:01,677
The next he's like, "Pam, you fax them.
Who cares what Erin's feeling." Right?

71
00:04:02,011 --> 00:04:03,428
Oh, Erin
Pam

72
00:04:03,513 --> 00:04:06,014
how would you rate me as a receptionist
on a scale of one to three?

73
00:04:06,391 --> 00:04:07,432
Um

74
00:04:07,517 --> 00:04:08,558
Two?

75
00:04:08,726 --> 00:04:10,435
It's like the second to
last thing I wanted to hear

76
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,812
No, I mean
you're doing great

77
00:04:11,896 --> 00:04:14,648
and Andy put you in charge
of the whole party, right?

78
00:04:14,941 --> 00:04:16,191
Yeah
Yeah.

79
00:04:16,776 --> 00:04:20,529
Send completed. You are the
best in the biz. I can't deny

80
00:04:21,072 --> 00:04:23,907
Bob and I are doing this
Scranton haunted walking tour

81
00:04:23,992 --> 00:04:26,201
I always wondered what kind
of people went on that thing.

82
00:04:26,286 --> 00:04:28,287
Hey, if you go
by the Banshee Pub

83
00:04:28,371 --> 00:04:31,540
tell the Man in Black
I say hello

84
00:04:36,629 --> 00:04:38,380
What happened, Pam?
Okay.

85
00:04:38,464 --> 00:04:42,175
When I was 22, I worked there and
everybody said the place was haunted.

86
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:45,387
I didn't believe it until
one day before we opened

87
00:04:45,805 --> 00:04:48,307
I look up into the mirror
you know, behind the bar?

88
00:04:48,641 --> 00:04:52,561
And I see this old man
dressed all in black,

89
00:04:53,271 --> 00:04:56,565
but when I turn around
there's no one there.

90
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:00,068
So, I tell the cook my story
Wait, they have food there?

91
00:05:00,153 --> 00:05:01,653
and he said

92
00:05:01,738 --> 00:05:05,907
"That's what everyone sees
That's the Man in Black.'

93
00:05:07,285 --> 00:05:11,038
No. My wife does not
believe in ghosts

94
00:05:13,875 --> 00:05:15,292
Hey
Hey

95
00:05:15,376 --> 00:05:16,376
Oh

96
00:05:16,919 --> 00:05:19,254
This Man in Black thing What
do you think that was about?

97
00:05:19,589 --> 00:05:21,506
What do you mean? Was it
like trickery in the lights

98
00:05:21,591 --> 00:05:23,800
or maybe you were so primed
to see it then there it was

99
00:05:23,885 --> 00:05:26,178
I saw a ghost
Mm-hmm

100
00:05:26,512 --> 00:05:28,930
What I'm saying is, like do
you ever wonder what it was?

101
00:05:29,098 --> 00:05:31,308
It was a ghost. I told you
this on like our first date

102
00:05:31,601 --> 00:05:34,353
Yeah, I had just told you about the
day that I met the Blue Angels.

103
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:37,356
I figured you had to top it I
don't know what to tell you, Jim

104
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,191
but I saw a ghost

105
00:05:45,156 --> 00:05:46,365
Hey

106
00:05:46,574 --> 00:05:47,657
Uh-oh

107
00:05:47,658 --> 00:05:50,786
Looks like we're under a Jack attack.
- Yes, Andrew.

108
00:05:50,953 --> 00:05:54,456
And you, on this day of
fantasy, are a labourer

109
00:05:56,959 --> 00:06:00,379
Yes Everyone, this
is Bert, my son.

110
00:06:00,755 --> 00:06:04,299
Bert, this is
a paper company

111
00:06:04,384 --> 00:06:05,717
Hey, Bert

112
00:06:06,094 --> 00:06:07,302
Hello

113
00:06:07,387 --> 00:06:10,013
Can I use a computer?
I need to check a hurricane

114
00:06:10,348 --> 00:06:11,723
Here, use this one

115
00:06:14,644 --> 00:06:15,644
All right

116
00:06:16,979 --> 00:06:19,481
Oh, look, pin the word
on the witch

117
00:06:19,732 --> 00:06:21,483
How did you know
I was bringing my son?

118
00:06:21,567 --> 00:06:24,653
I didn't. It was for us
But he can play.

119
00:06:24,737 --> 00:06:26,780
Berty Boy, would you
like to play this game?

120
00:06:26,989 --> 00:06:28,281
That stuff's for babies

121
00:06:28,366 --> 00:06:32,577
Perhaps this party will
awaken the baby in all of us

122
00:06:32,662 --> 00:06:36,540
Wow. Who shot our grownup
party with the kiddy ray gun?

123
00:06:37,166 --> 00:06:39,876
We're still getting it set up
It's going to be really cool

124
00:06:43,131 --> 00:06:46,466
Extraordinary.
Did you plan this?

125
00:06:46,551 --> 00:06:48,677
Well, Toby and I did, yeah

126
00:06:48,761 --> 00:06:52,431
And I overheard and thought "Hey,
that'd be fun don't mind if I do.'

127
00:06:52,515 --> 00:06:55,267
If you turn out the lights
we'll do a little dance

128
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:57,185
One, two, three

129
00:06:57,270 --> 00:07:00,856
Dem bones, dem bones,
dem dry bones

130
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:03,859
Now we're the skeleton crew

131
00:07:05,361 --> 00:07:07,279
Delightful.
Thank you

132
00:07:07,363 --> 00:07:09,448
Now then
how are we today?

133
00:07:09,532 --> 00:07:10,907
Fine
Great.

134
00:07:10,992 --> 00:07:12,451
Just fine, Kelly?
Everything all right?

135
00:07:12,577 --> 00:07:13,618
Mm-hmm

136
00:07:13,703 --> 00:07:15,495
You feeling fulfilled
in your life?

137
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:16,705
I guess

138
00:07:16,789 --> 00:07:19,624
You guess? So there is
something you want that you

139
00:07:20,793 --> 00:07:21,835
do not have

140
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:24,045
Try not to think
about it

141
00:07:24,922 --> 00:07:27,757
Because it's too
terrifying to imagine

142
00:07:28,551 --> 00:07:30,218
Now we're cooking

143
00:07:30,553 --> 00:07:34,473
What is it, Kelly? What is
this great fear of yours?

144
00:07:35,391 --> 00:07:39,561
Never marrying Yes. Dying
alone, that is very scary.

145
00:07:41,731 --> 00:07:43,607
And how are you, Toby?

146
00:07:44,233 --> 00:07:45,567
So great

147
00:07:50,615 --> 00:07:53,200
Oh, I put those up. I know.
I'm taking them down.

148
00:07:53,284 --> 00:07:57,787
I almost wonder if putting
nothing on this wall

149
00:07:58,789 --> 00:08:01,041
is more Halloween-y

150
00:08:01,125 --> 00:08:02,834
I don't know
about this, guys

151
00:08:02,919 --> 00:08:04,961
Andy put me in charge of
the Halloween party, so.

152
00:08:05,046 --> 00:08:07,380
Well, Andy sent us
in here, so which is it?

153
00:08:08,132 --> 00:08:09,174
Oh

154
00:08:09,258 --> 00:08:12,969
So can we speak our minds now? Or
are we still sparing feelings?

155
00:08:13,054 --> 00:08:15,263
Because I hate
all of this.

156
00:08:17,767 --> 00:08:19,935
Very low pressure
in the Sargasso Sea

157
00:08:20,019 --> 00:08:22,145
Warm air from South America

158
00:08:22,772 --> 00:08:26,024
Cold air from Greenland All signs
point to the perfect storm.

159
00:08:26,734 --> 00:08:28,276
Perfectly mediocre

160
00:08:28,486 --> 00:08:29,569
What are you, anyway?

161
00:08:29,654 --> 00:08:32,447
I'm a Jamaican zombie woman
Leave me alone, ghoul

162
00:08:32,823 --> 00:08:35,158
If you had some really big
wings with blades on the end

163
00:08:35,785 --> 00:08:37,786
you'd kind of look like
Kerrigan from StarCraft.

164
00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:41,373
Damn it! I am Kerrigan from StarCraft.
I've been censored.

165
00:08:41,457 --> 00:08:43,959
If you're going to be a
Zerg, at least be a lurker

166
00:08:44,085 --> 00:08:47,212
Not some girl. Kerrigan is
ruler of the Zerg swarm

167
00:08:47,296 --> 00:08:50,799
Yeah. She also has boobs.
Yeah, but no nipples

168
00:08:53,302 --> 00:08:56,137
Hey
Hey, what's up?

169
00:08:56,514 --> 00:08:59,975
November's sure creeping up, ain't it?
You can't stop that month

170
00:09:03,604 --> 00:09:07,315
Hey, what's the jive with Angela and
Phyllis helping with the party, you know?

171
00:09:09,443 --> 00:09:10,443
Um

172
00:09:10,528 --> 00:09:12,737
I just thought you could
use some help, you know?

173
00:09:12,822 --> 00:09:16,116
'Cause Robert came in and thought
the party seemed a little kiddy.

174
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:19,119
And I guess I agreed
And maybe we could

175
00:09:19,662 --> 00:09:22,581
mix a little more 13
into the PG.

176
00:09:26,335 --> 00:09:27,836
But that's it?

177
00:09:27,962 --> 00:09:30,463
There's nothing
about me or I?

178
00:09:32,675 --> 00:09:35,218
Can we talk about it
at the end of the day?

179
00:09:35,678 --> 00:09:38,179
I got a call
I got to make a call

180
00:09:38,806 --> 00:09:41,141
Yeah, sorry
Yes, we can

181
00:09:51,193 --> 00:09:53,570
Yes. I don't know

182
00:09:54,363 --> 00:09:55,363
Mm-hmm

183
00:09:56,866 --> 00:09:59,284
Gabe?
Sweet Erin

184
00:09:59,368 --> 00:10:02,037
I'm throwing the Halloween party and
I just want to amp it up a little.

185
00:10:02,121 --> 00:10:05,123
I think it could use
some extra pizzazz

186
00:10:05,207 --> 00:10:07,167
Okay. Where does
Gabe factor in?

187
00:10:07,251 --> 00:10:09,586
Remember that Halloween
party you took me to once?

188
00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:13,298
The one where I started crying
as soon as I walked in

189
00:10:13,382 --> 00:10:16,176
and I didn't stop crying?
Yes. Lars and Takako's

190
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:19,888
Okay, well let's say that I
wanted this party to be a tiny

191
00:10:20,556 --> 00:10:22,182
tiny bit like that one

192
00:10:22,683 --> 00:10:27,604
just more adult,
more scary and sexy

193
00:10:27,688 --> 00:10:29,648
I will make this sexier
than you could ever imagine

194
00:10:29,732 --> 00:10:33,276
No, just scary. If we wanted
ideas for scary stuff

195
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:42,661
No, that'd be scary
What are you thinking about?

196
00:10:43,371 --> 00:10:45,580
All right, let me go get it

197
00:10:49,543 --> 00:10:51,628
Pam Halpert
Hey. It's Jim Halpert.

198
00:10:52,630 --> 00:10:54,339
I was wondering if you wanted
to see a movie tonight

199
00:10:54,423 --> 00:10:56,925
'cause I've read a lot about
this really great documentary

200
00:10:57,259 --> 00:10:59,844
Is it called Ghostbusters?
It's called Ghostbusters.

201
00:11:00,846 --> 00:11:02,430
It didn't look like that

202
00:11:02,515 --> 00:11:04,349
He didn't have
a buster sign around him?

203
00:11:04,975 --> 00:11:06,726
Why don't you draw him? Why
don't we see this old man?

204
00:11:06,852 --> 00:11:09,104
Okay. Yeah. Fine,
I'll draw him Okay.

205
00:11:11,190 --> 00:11:12,565
I ain't afraid of no ghosts

206
00:11:15,069 --> 00:11:16,111
Whoa

207
00:11:17,113 --> 00:11:18,113
Mm-hmm

208
00:11:18,406 --> 00:11:20,573
Dwight, are you eating a stick?
It's a root, idiot.

209
00:11:20,658 --> 00:11:21,950
Okay

210
00:11:23,911 --> 00:11:26,121
Everyone hates you.
That's really rude

211
00:11:26,455 --> 00:11:28,790
I don't tell you hurricanes
suck even though it's true

212
00:11:29,166 --> 00:11:32,043
What do you like, tornadoes?
Try influenza

213
00:11:32,128 --> 00:11:34,713
Yeah? What's the vaccine you
could take to avoid a hurricane?

214
00:11:35,005 --> 00:11:38,049
Open up a newspaper.
Look, a hurricane's coming

215
00:11:38,134 --> 00:11:40,969
I suppose you're going to tell me
the scariest animal is a shark.

216
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:42,554
Try box jellyfish

217
00:11:46,058 --> 00:11:47,892
What are we talking about?

218
00:11:47,977 --> 00:11:50,395
I was talking about my wife and
how she believes in ghosts

219
00:11:50,479 --> 00:11:53,898
Then we had a little debate and then
Meredith said that she believes in them too

220
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:56,401
You seem unimpressed.
Ghosts don't scare you?

221
00:11:56,485 --> 00:12:01,865
I'm only scared of real things,
like serial killers and kidnappers.

222
00:12:01,949 --> 00:12:05,493
Not things that don't exist
like ghosts or mummies

223
00:12:05,578 --> 00:12:08,371
Mummies are real There
are mummies at museums

224
00:12:09,415 --> 00:12:10,498
Yeah

225
00:12:10,916 --> 00:12:12,292
You prank

226
00:12:12,376 --> 00:12:14,461
It's true. They've
been preserved for

227
00:12:15,337 --> 00:12:17,922
thousands of years
They're all over.

228
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:25,013
Why on Earth would a
museum put a mummy in it?

229
00:12:31,270 --> 00:12:33,480
A little
witch's brew?

230
00:12:34,148 --> 00:12:36,191
I grew this party
up real fast.

231
00:12:36,275 --> 00:12:39,277
Get out of here, little kid party.
Nobody loves you.

232
00:12:39,361 --> 00:12:43,114
And clean up your room Grownups
are going to use it later

233
00:12:44,366 --> 00:12:46,201
The party looks fun
doesn't it?

234
00:12:46,285 --> 00:12:49,037
Everybody seems to be in
there having a great time

235
00:12:49,121 --> 00:12:52,248
So maybe now would be a great time
for me to pop back on the computer

236
00:12:52,333 --> 00:12:55,168
I'm using it. I'm about to
play StarCraft with him

237
00:12:57,546 --> 00:12:59,422
You serious?
Yeah, I'm serious

238
00:12:59,507 --> 00:13:01,591
Hey, hey. That's funny

239
00:13:03,052 --> 00:13:04,719
Okay.
Loser

240
00:13:05,805 --> 00:13:09,307
Pam, do you think anyone's going to
notice I've worn this costume before

241
00:13:09,391 --> 00:13:11,184
when I wasn't pregnant?

242
00:13:11,268 --> 00:13:13,812
You know I guess nobody would
believe it still fits.

243
00:13:15,523 --> 00:13:19,984
Hey, guys, I'm
an Oscar Liar Weiner

244
00:13:20,611 --> 00:13:21,736
Oh, my God

245
00:13:22,029 --> 00:13:24,989
Party's tight, E Fog is cool.
Thanks

246
00:13:25,074 --> 00:13:26,866
It's on medium
Perfect

247
00:13:27,535 --> 00:13:29,744
It really looks great
You did a great job

248
00:13:29,912 --> 00:13:32,580
Oh. So we don't have
to have that talk?

249
00:13:32,665 --> 00:13:34,499
We should still
have that talk

250
00:13:34,583 --> 00:13:37,085
Maybe you could come by
my office at like 4:45?

251
00:13:38,754 --> 00:13:39,963
Cool

252
00:13:40,673 --> 00:13:42,882
Okay.

253
00:13:42,967 --> 00:13:45,385
Okay, everybody,

254
00:13:45,928 --> 00:13:49,514
be prepared
to be scared

255
00:13:49,974 --> 00:13:51,599
Okay

256
00:14:10,077 --> 00:14:13,121
The Cinema of the Unsettling
is a growing film movement.

257
00:14:13,205 --> 00:14:16,499
The most well known film in the
genre is an hour long shot

258
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:19,127
of a squirrel
with diarrhea

259
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:25,633
Okay. Ew

260
00:14:28,512 --> 00:14:29,846
Is that my grandmother?

261
00:14:30,347 --> 00:14:32,557
What's the story?
- There is no story.

262
00:14:32,641 --> 00:14:34,601
Yeah, seems like
there isn't a narrative.

263
00:14:34,685 --> 00:14:38,062
Maybe the filmmaker realized that
even narrative is comforting

264
00:14:40,149 --> 00:14:41,566
What the he
is going on here?

265
00:14:41,650 --> 00:14:42,734
Okay, I think
we've seen enough

266
00:14:42,818 --> 00:14:44,819
You can turn it off now
- Yeah

267
00:14:45,821 --> 00:14:47,989
Yeah, kill it. go ahead
and turn it off.

268
00:14:48,198 --> 00:14:49,741
Thank you - How'd
you get in my car?

269
00:14:49,867 --> 00:14:51,659
Where is this from?
That is so upsetting

270
00:14:52,328 --> 00:14:54,913
That was awful
Robert, I apologize

271
00:14:54,997 --> 00:14:58,666
I'm sorry. I got confused
I heard that you

272
00:14:58,751 --> 00:15:03,087
wanted to make the party more adult
but I think I know what to do now

273
00:15:03,714 --> 00:15:06,799
This game is called
"Pecker Poker.'

274
00:15:06,926 --> 00:15:10,845
It's the game of cards
that gets you hard.

275
00:15:13,182 --> 00:15:16,517
What we have here is a
classic misunderstanding.

276
00:15:16,810 --> 00:15:19,520
Why didn't you simply
ask Andy to clarify?

277
00:15:19,605 --> 00:15:22,440
Asking is a very
easy thing to do

278
00:15:22,524 --> 00:15:25,026
The two of you are
obviously very close

279
00:15:30,282 --> 00:15:34,702
Oh, I see. This no longer
seems like my business

280
00:15:41,043 --> 00:15:42,210
All I knew is that

281
00:15:42,544 --> 00:15:44,587
you wanted to have a talk
with me at the end of the day

282
00:15:44,672 --> 00:15:46,130
and I got nervous, so

283
00:15:46,215 --> 00:15:48,758
You were going
to talk at the end of

284
00:15:48,842 --> 00:15:49,926
I'm not here

285
00:15:52,888 --> 00:15:54,389
Did you think I was
going to fire you?

286
00:15:55,849 --> 00:15:57,183
No, I wasn't

287
00:15:59,937 --> 00:16:02,230
I'm sorry This must be
really uncomfortable for you

288
00:16:02,314 --> 00:16:04,399
I'm never uncomfortable

289
00:16:04,650 --> 00:16:05,817
Okay

290
00:16:06,735 --> 00:16:10,571
Erin, I think you know
I've been dating someone

291
00:16:11,907 --> 00:16:13,032
Sure

292
00:16:13,283 --> 00:16:15,284
And it's getting
a little more serious

293
00:16:15,869 --> 00:16:18,913
She's never come by, so
And she's never called here

294
00:16:20,249 --> 00:16:21,666
Unless it's your mom

295
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:26,004
No, I didn't want her to call because
I thought it would be weird, but

296
00:16:26,088 --> 00:16:28,006
now it's weird
that she's not calling

297
00:16:29,049 --> 00:16:30,091
Two dates?

298
00:16:31,593 --> 00:16:32,635
Three dates?

299
00:16:33,262 --> 00:16:34,595
Thirty-one

300
00:16:36,098 --> 00:16:37,265
Wow

301
00:16:38,308 --> 00:16:40,685
I'm so happy
for you guys.

302
00:16:40,769 --> 00:16:42,603
Um. Let me know
when you get to 40

303
00:16:44,106 --> 00:16:45,773
I'll see you guys

304
00:16:48,485 --> 00:16:50,278
I should go

305
00:16:53,615 --> 00:16:54,657
I just don't get it, Pam

306
00:16:54,742 --> 00:16:56,534
I mean, you're a rational
person Thank you.

307
00:16:56,618 --> 00:16:59,120
Jim doesn't let me wash his NFL
jersey during the playoffs

308
00:16:59,246 --> 00:17:01,622
How is this any less logical?
Careful. Whoa

309
00:17:02,458 --> 00:17:05,168
First of all, it's not like I think
that's going to help the Eagles win

310
00:17:05,252 --> 00:17:06,586
Really?
No.

311
00:17:06,670 --> 00:17:09,422
That is just a bunch of people
participating in a collective thing.

312
00:17:09,965 --> 00:17:12,717
And maybe the Eagles will hear about
it and want to play better. It's not

313
00:17:12,801 --> 00:17:14,052
Exactly.
Thank you

314
00:17:14,136 --> 00:17:15,428
Go! Get up there
right now.

315
00:17:15,512 --> 00:17:16,888
Got it
Dwight

316
00:17:17,139 --> 00:17:19,140
You want to attack, or let them come to us?
Your call, B.

317
00:17:19,224 --> 00:17:21,392
Unleash the hell storm.
- Dwight

318
00:17:21,477 --> 00:17:23,311
Nice
Dwight

319
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:24,604
Got 'em. Go

320
00:17:25,689 --> 00:17:29,442
Is she Asian? I don't know.
She's from somewhere, I bet

321
00:17:30,611 --> 00:17:32,737
Maybe from the forest
Forest?

322
00:17:32,821 --> 00:17:34,614
Did Andy say his girlfriend's
from the forest?

323
00:17:34,698 --> 00:17:37,283
I don't know, Phyllis
Maybe she's from the city

324
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:45,166
Looks terribly real
doesn't it, Creed?

325
00:17:45,584 --> 00:17:47,919
No
Are you scared of snakes?

326
00:17:48,003 --> 00:17:49,378
You don't live
as long as I have

327
00:17:49,463 --> 00:17:51,422
without a healthy fear
of snakes, Bobby.

328
00:17:53,509 --> 00:17:56,928
Yeah, I guess sometimes I have
nightmares about being buried alive.

329
00:17:57,638 --> 00:18:00,848
Honestly, Jim gives
me the creeps

330
00:18:01,975 --> 00:18:03,810
What am I up to?

331
00:18:05,062 --> 00:18:07,313
Like a few years
down the road, Cece says

332
00:18:07,397 --> 00:18:09,607
"Mom, there's
a ghost in my closet.'

333
00:18:09,691 --> 00:18:12,860
Now you say one of two things One,
"You're just having a bad dream."

334
00:18:12,945 --> 00:18:14,779
Or two, "Let's go see
what it wants."

335
00:18:14,863 --> 00:18:16,614
I'm not going
to freak her out, Jim

336
00:18:16,698 --> 00:18:18,449
Okay I'm not going
to lie to her either

337
00:18:18,534 --> 00:18:21,577
Oh, come on
When I was a boy,

338
00:18:22,538 --> 00:18:27,208
there was an empty house just
up the h from my family's

339
00:18:27,292 --> 00:18:30,503
It was rumored a man
committed suicide there

340
00:18:30,587 --> 00:18:33,089
after being possessed
by the devil

341
00:18:33,882 --> 00:18:36,384
One day, a young woman, Lydia

342
00:18:36,844 --> 00:18:39,470
moved into the house
with her infant child.

343
00:18:39,555 --> 00:18:45,101
That very night Lydia was awakened
by a loud heinous hissing sound

344
00:18:47,813 --> 00:18:52,233
She walked to the nursery and
there in baby's crib was a snake

345
00:18:52,943 --> 00:18:54,527
wrapped around baby's neck

346
00:18:55,279 --> 00:18:56,988
squeezing tighter and tighter

347
00:18:57,072 --> 00:19:00,074
Oh, my goodness
The crib was full of dirt,

348
00:19:00,784 --> 00:19:03,286
baby struggled to free
itself from underneath

349
00:19:03,370 --> 00:19:07,290
reaching and clawing
gasping for air

350
00:19:07,875 --> 00:19:11,794
Embalmed bodies rose
from their sarcophagi,

351
00:19:11,879 --> 00:19:13,838
lurching toward baby

352
00:19:16,425 --> 00:19:18,676
For they were mummies
No.

353
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:20,803
Amongst them was a man

354
00:19:21,638 --> 00:19:24,307
Tall, slim.
Jim

355
00:19:24,892 --> 00:19:27,935
Almost instinctively
she turned to her husband

356
00:19:28,729 --> 00:19:30,021
"Wait," she thought

357
00:19:31,648 --> 00:19:34,483
"I don't have a husband.'

358
00:19:34,735 --> 00:19:39,697
For Lydia and her husband had had an
argument one they couldn't get past

359
00:19:39,781 --> 00:19:44,535
Each night they slept one inch farther
apart until one night Lydia left

360
00:19:45,078 --> 00:19:48,998
It was about this time she lost
herself in imaginary worlds.

361
00:19:50,083 --> 00:19:52,501
She had quit the
book club the choir,

362
00:19:52,586 --> 00:19:55,755
citing something about
their high expectations

363
00:19:56,465 --> 00:19:59,508
Her lips slowly
grew together from disuse

364
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:02,136
Every time she wanted
to act, and didn't,

365
00:20:02,221 --> 00:20:05,556
another part of her face
hardened until it was stone

366
00:20:05,641 --> 00:20:09,310
And that fevered night
she rushed to the nursery

367
00:20:09,436 --> 00:20:12,897
and threw open the door
"Baby, are you okay?"

368
00:20:13,941 --> 00:20:15,983
Baby sat up slowly

369
00:20:17,819 --> 00:20:20,071
turned to mother

370
00:20:20,155 --> 00:20:21,197
and said

371
00:20:23,659 --> 00:20:27,578
"I'm fine, bitch. I'm fine.'

372
00:20:37,089 --> 00:20:40,007
Fear plays an interesting
role in our lives.

373
00:20:40,634 --> 00:20:43,302
How dare we let
it motivate us?

374
00:20:44,471 --> 00:20:48,057
How dare we let it into our decision
making? Into our livelihoods.

375
00:20:48,141 --> 00:20:50,184
Into our relationships.

376
00:20:51,186 --> 00:20:56,274
It's funny, isn't it? We take a day a year
to dress up in costume and celebrate fear.

377
00:20:59,486 --> 00:21:02,571
Toby. Hey, Bert. Want
to see the dance?

378
00:21:03,156 --> 00:21:04,448
Dem bones,
dem bones, dem dry...

379
00:21:04,533 --> 00:21:05,616
You're fired

380
00:21:06,910 --> 00:21:08,744
What?
You heard me.

381
00:21:08,829 --> 00:21:09,870
Pack your things

382
00:21:11,164 --> 00:21:14,166
What? You can't
Gabe? Are you

383
00:21:14,251 --> 00:21:16,294
I'm the CEO's son

384
00:21:16,378 --> 00:21:18,713
Pack your things
You're done.
