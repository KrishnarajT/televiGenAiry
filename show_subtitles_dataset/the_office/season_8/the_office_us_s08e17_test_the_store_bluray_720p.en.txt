1
00:00:01,308 --> 00:00:05,060
Today is the test paunch day
for the inaugural Sabre store.

2
00:00:06,479 --> 00:00:10,524
And I, Dwight Schrute, am in
charge of the entire operation.

3
00:00:10,817 --> 00:00:13,611
If I can prove myself today and the
store is a hit with the media,

4
00:00:13,695 --> 00:00:17,489
and Nellie sees this,
the vice presidency is mine

5
00:00:17,574 --> 00:00:18,741
Hey, are you
holding this chair?

6
00:00:18,825 --> 00:00:20,200
Because I feel like
I'm going to fall off

7
00:00:20,285 --> 00:00:21,911
Yeah. Yes. Yes I'm not wearing
the right shoes for this

8
00:00:21,995 --> 00:00:23,078
We went
over this, okay?

9
00:00:23,163 --> 00:00:24,622
Your tiny fingers
make the best knots

10
00:00:24,998 --> 00:00:28,167
Hey, strangers. I'm so stoked
for the Sabre store opening

11
00:00:32,213 --> 00:00:35,215
Hey, my name's Tabitha I'm camped
out in front of the Sabre store

12
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:37,676
so I can be first in line
for the new Pyramid.

13
00:00:38,428 --> 00:00:39,470
Psst

14
00:00:39,554 --> 00:00:42,431
It's me, Erin. Dwight had
me pretend to be a hipster

15
00:00:42,515 --> 00:00:43,891
to create hype
and it's working

16
00:00:43,975 --> 00:00:46,518
There's already people
camped out behind me

17
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:02,242
NELLIE
Test launch day, people.

18
00:01:02,369 --> 00:01:06,956
Now, I would like to fill you in
on a little secret about me

19
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:08,791
To inspire you today

20
00:01:08,875 --> 00:01:12,211
Now I know you probably all think
I'm this patrician goddess

21
00:01:12,295 --> 00:01:14,213
But here's the truth

22
00:01:14,547 --> 00:01:17,341
I was born in the little
working-class town of Basildon

23
00:01:18,051 --> 00:01:19,885
and until the age of 32

24
00:01:19,970 --> 00:01:21,428
I talked like this

25
00:01:21,513 --> 00:01:23,931
Which was
bloody horrendous, innit?

26
00:01:24,349 --> 00:01:27,893
No, lower than

27
00:01:28,478 --> 00:01:29,687
What's lower than dirt?

28
00:01:29,771 --> 00:01:32,398
Loam. Magma. Mantle
Outer core. Inner core.

29
00:01:32,482 --> 00:01:36,318
Yeah, thank you. Loam.
Bloody loam I came from

30
00:01:36,569 --> 00:01:38,988
when I auditioned
for the Spice Girls

31
00:01:39,072 --> 00:01:40,739
get a callback

32
00:01:40,824 --> 00:01:41,865
Which Spice Girl?

33
00:01:41,992 --> 00:01:43,033
The black one

34
00:01:45,954 --> 00:01:46,996
Okay

35
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:48,998
Now think about my
journey here today

36
00:01:49,082 --> 00:01:51,625
and let it inspire
your journey.

37
00:01:52,252 --> 00:01:54,044
Okay Nellie, thank you
Thank you so much

38
00:01:54,129 --> 00:01:55,170
Yep. Yep

39
00:01:55,255 --> 00:02:00,551
Today is press day, and press is
going to make or break this store

40
00:02:00,635 --> 00:02:04,263
And for a tech company press can
only mean one thing, bloggers.

41
00:02:04,681 --> 00:02:06,181
Dossier on bloggers

42
00:02:06,266 --> 00:02:11,437
Bloggers are gross Bloggers are obese.
Bloggers have halitosis

43
00:02:12,105 --> 00:02:13,439
You're going to love them

44
00:02:14,024 --> 00:02:16,567
Ryan is going to be
the main event today

45
00:02:16,818 --> 00:02:18,944
He is the pitchman
who is going to give

46
00:02:19,029 --> 00:02:21,196
the feisty yet
profound speech

47
00:02:21,281 --> 00:02:23,741
worthy of a world's fair.
Ryan, you ready to do this?

48
00:02:23,825 --> 00:02:25,034
When people see
this presentation,

49
00:02:25,118 --> 00:02:26,493
they're going to
â™ª in their pants

50
00:02:26,494 --> 00:02:27,619
Come on, man.
- Come on

51
00:02:27,704 --> 00:02:29,621
Okay
Seriously disgusting

52
00:02:29,748 --> 00:02:31,790
Cathy, you will be the hot
girl who talks to bloggers

53
00:02:31,958 --> 00:02:34,376
Ugh! Kill me
It was my idea

54
00:02:34,461 --> 00:02:37,171
Packer, you will be the sexual
predator who has come to prey

55
00:02:37,255 --> 00:02:40,299
on the trendy teenage girls who
are obsessed with the Pyramid

56
00:02:40,592 --> 00:02:41,967
Uh...
- Ah

57
00:02:42,093 --> 00:02:43,218
That is excellent

58
00:02:43,303 --> 00:02:44,470
I don't see what
that gets us,

59
00:02:44,554 --> 00:02:45,637
but I'm a team player

60
00:02:45,722 --> 00:02:46,889
Perfect casting, right?

61
00:02:46,973 --> 00:02:50,059
Schrute's out to get me,
but I'm playing the long game

62
00:02:50,143 --> 00:02:53,896
As soon as he messes up I swoop
in like a sexual predator.

63
00:02:54,939 --> 00:02:59,318
Of wonder and enthusiasm

64
00:02:59,486 --> 00:03:03,739
as if at the end of E.T., candy
poured out of the screen.

65
00:03:04,115 --> 00:03:05,449
Do you understand?

66
00:03:05,992 --> 00:03:07,534
Goose pimples

67
00:03:08,495 --> 00:03:12,706
Speaking of pimples let's
release the bloggers!

68
00:03:14,793 --> 00:03:15,834
Morning, everyone

69
00:03:15,919 --> 00:03:17,586
Oh, Andy, guess what
happened to me this morning

70
00:03:17,712 --> 00:03:19,463
Don't care. Tell me later
Listen, it's important.

71
00:03:19,547 --> 00:03:20,798
You've got to hear this

72
00:03:22,801 --> 00:03:23,884
What do you got?

73
00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:25,844
Oh, my God
Do you have a black eye?

74
00:03:25,929 --> 00:03:27,137
Yes, I do, Phyllis

75
00:03:27,222 --> 00:03:29,098
I woke up at 4:00 a.m
by accident

76
00:03:29,182 --> 00:03:30,974
in time for
the paper to be delivered

77
00:03:31,059 --> 00:03:32,059
Guess what?

78
00:03:32,435 --> 00:03:35,771
It's not a kid on a bike
It's a man in a car

79
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:37,397
Andy, who punched you?

80
00:03:37,607 --> 00:03:40,567
Hey, I was on the can What's this
about a black guy in the office?

81
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:42,444
Black eye, Meredith

82
00:03:42,529 --> 00:03:44,196
Will someone please explain
what's going on here?

83
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:47,950
Since the interesting thing happened
until now so much time has passed

84
00:03:48,034 --> 00:03:49,409
It's like my
life is buffering

85
00:03:50,203 --> 00:03:53,789
Here's what happened Pam and
I were arriving for the day

86
00:03:53,873 --> 00:03:58,460
and there was a gang in the parking
lot, on bikes, on motorcycles

87
00:03:58,545 --> 00:04:00,796
And they just
were hassling Pam.

88
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:02,047
That's true.

89
00:04:02,132 --> 00:04:03,507
They had weapons.

90
00:04:03,591 --> 00:04:04,633
Weapons.

91
00:04:05,051 --> 00:04:07,344
To talk some sense
into them.

92
00:04:07,428 --> 00:04:10,597
But these were not the kind of
people who use their words.

93
00:04:10,723 --> 00:04:13,350
Punches were going,
and I ducked a few,

94
00:04:13,434 --> 00:04:15,769
landed a couple, and I
was fighting them off.

95
00:04:15,854 --> 00:04:19,064
It was a totally
like, senseless crime

96
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:21,024
Thank goodness he was there.
- Good job, Andy.

97
00:04:23,319 --> 00:04:26,113
Any of you wouldn't
have done.

98
00:04:26,906 --> 00:04:28,365
Open the gates

99
00:04:29,534 --> 00:04:32,369
There's plenty for
everyone No need to panic

100
00:04:32,453 --> 00:04:34,872
There's plenty for
everyone There's plenty

101
00:04:34,956 --> 00:04:37,457
Don't stampede.
No need to stampede, sir

102
00:04:38,084 --> 00:04:42,754
Okay, okay! Hey, hey It's going
to be fine It's going to be fine

103
00:04:42,881 --> 00:04:44,381
There's plenty of Pyramids

104
00:04:44,465 --> 00:04:46,133
Come on,
I was in line before you

105
00:04:46,718 --> 00:04:48,510
So you're
a blogger, right?

106
00:04:48,595 --> 00:04:49,761
Yeah

107
00:04:49,929 --> 00:04:51,013
Blogger

108
00:04:51,097 --> 00:04:52,931
God, stay away

109
00:04:54,893 --> 00:04:56,518
Oh, I always get in
trouble around bloggers

110
00:04:56,603 --> 00:04:58,270
I'm trying to be
a good girl for once

111
00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:02,274
Uh, yeah, I already bought my Pyramid
but I don't want to leave yet.

112
00:05:02,358 --> 00:05:05,694
Since seeing Zooey Deschanel

113
00:05:05,778 --> 00:05:08,947
at the Coachella music festival.
So fun.

114
00:05:09,282 --> 00:05:11,491
How can we feel safe knowing
that there are gangs here?

115
00:05:11,618 --> 00:05:13,243
We should call the police right now
- Yes

116
00:05:13,328 --> 00:05:16,288
No, no, no, no, no, no We don't
need to call the police.

117
00:05:16,539 --> 00:05:18,290
They'll just ask
everybody questions

118
00:05:18,374 --> 00:05:20,125
get up in everyone's
business right, Pam?

119
00:05:20,210 --> 00:05:22,794
Police are a hassle We
settled this on the street

120
00:05:22,921 --> 00:05:26,173
And my eye will heal.
But if the police come

121
00:05:26,257 --> 00:05:29,635
then we will forever stain our
neighborhood as a troubled area

122
00:05:29,886 --> 00:05:33,055
Why would you care what the
police think of our neighborhood?

123
00:05:33,139 --> 00:05:37,309
Because I have
neighborhood pride

124
00:05:38,728 --> 00:05:40,979
Guys, guys
that's so vague

125
00:05:41,147 --> 00:05:43,065
You got to do
the zip plus four

126
00:05:43,316 --> 00:05:47,152
18505-7427

127
00:05:47,612 --> 00:05:50,989
Look, I don't feel safe I think
we should call the police.

128
00:05:51,115 --> 00:05:52,908
Yes Exactly, we
need to feel safe,

129
00:05:52,992 --> 00:05:57,496
which is why Toby is
teaching us self-defense.

130
00:05:59,415 --> 00:06:00,415
Me?

131
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:02,000
Toby, will you
teach us self-defense?

132
00:06:02,335 --> 00:06:04,920
Yeah. I can't believe
you remembered

133
00:06:05,004 --> 00:06:08,340
I'll go put on my cup

134
00:06:09,092 --> 00:06:10,133
Great

135
00:06:10,551 --> 00:06:11,760
Yes
- Okay.

136
00:06:11,844 --> 00:06:13,887
One of you was Chuck

137
00:06:13,972 --> 00:06:16,014
Yeah, no, it seems
to be going great.

138
00:06:17,558 --> 00:06:19,351
Andy got beat up by
a fifth grade girl?

139
00:06:19,769 --> 00:06:21,687
Look at that guy, he's got
a Sabre phone on him,

140
00:06:21,771 --> 00:06:23,063
he's not even using it

141
00:06:23,147 --> 00:06:25,774
This is a perfect photo
for my daily fail blog.

142
00:06:26,859 --> 00:06:28,777
Uh, I got to go
Okay.

143
00:06:28,987 --> 00:06:31,154
Dwight, what is a fail?
That sounds bad.

144
00:06:31,239 --> 00:06:33,532
No, no, no, it's good
It's really

145
00:06:33,616 --> 00:06:36,535
On the Internet, that's a
really good good thing

146
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:39,329
Are you trying to
sabotage this entire event?

147
00:06:39,414 --> 00:06:40,497
I'm very sorry

148
00:06:40,581 --> 00:06:45,294
We gave you an Arrowhead
for free for the day.

149
00:06:45,586 --> 00:06:48,130
How hard would it have
been to do this? Hmm?

150
00:06:49,132 --> 00:06:53,719
Hello. Hi, sweetie, it's Jim I'm
calling you from my new Arrowhead

151
00:06:53,803 --> 00:06:55,429
which is why my
voice is crystal clear

152
00:06:55,513 --> 00:06:57,055
and my hand
won't ever get tired

153
00:06:57,140 --> 00:06:59,308
because of
the ergonomic shape

154
00:06:59,392 --> 00:07:03,103
I'm really sorry Is there anything I
can do? Maybe pretend to be Chuck?

155
00:07:03,229 --> 00:07:04,604
You could have
pretended to be Chuck

156
00:07:04,689 --> 00:07:06,481
I begged you to
pretend to be Chuck

157
00:07:06,566 --> 00:07:09,443
But you chose to be yourself and
you can no longer be Chuck.

158
00:07:09,694 --> 00:07:11,236
Surrender the tri-pack

159
00:07:16,868 --> 00:07:18,076
You know what
you have to do

160
00:07:24,584 --> 00:07:26,918
Point it towards
the store, idiot

161
00:07:36,888 --> 00:07:38,305
You know what I mean?

162
00:07:38,389 --> 00:07:39,681
Pick one of these
buttons and just

163
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:43,060
Damn it. Take over

164
00:07:43,936 --> 00:07:46,146
Oh, hey, hey, hey, you guys
You must be lost

165
00:07:46,230 --> 00:07:48,190
Listen.
Excuse me, sir

166
00:07:48,274 --> 00:07:51,026
The fountain where you can feed the
pigeons is out behind the bank.

167
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:53,195
Tell your great-grandson
to bring his kid by.

168
00:07:53,279 --> 00:07:55,364
Okay, so long
Here we go.

169
00:07:55,615 --> 00:07:57,449
Erin! Psst! Come on

170
00:07:57,700 --> 00:08:00,243
The elderly suck the life out of
the young Get them out of here

171
00:08:00,411 --> 00:08:02,996
We are closed
Come on

172
00:08:03,581 --> 00:08:06,541
Self-defense is not some
fun boxing match okay?

173
00:08:06,626 --> 00:08:08,210
This is about
escaping with your life

174
00:08:08,294 --> 00:08:12,047
So strike
scream and run

175
00:08:13,174 --> 00:08:14,299
All right,
let's try it

176
00:08:20,431 --> 00:08:21,431
That may have
been my fault.

177
00:08:21,516 --> 00:08:22,599
What the hell, Toby?

178
00:08:22,683 --> 00:08:24,893
Okay, look in a real
crisis situation

179
00:08:24,977 --> 00:08:26,561
you're not going to
have time to think.

180
00:08:27,021 --> 00:08:29,815
Okay?
So just remember IAATG

181
00:08:30,358 --> 00:08:31,942
"It's All About The Groin.'

182
00:08:32,026 --> 00:08:37,197
What if you're being
attacked by a smallish man

183
00:08:37,281 --> 00:08:39,157
who happens to
not have a groin?

184
00:08:39,826 --> 00:08:41,243
I don't think
that's very common

185
00:08:41,327 --> 00:08:42,911
But what if
you're being attacked

186
00:08:42,995 --> 00:08:45,789
by a 4'11" man
who's penis-less

187
00:08:46,124 --> 00:08:49,209
Why are you fixated on this
hypothetical transgendered attacker?

188
00:08:49,377 --> 00:08:50,794
Why don't we
start with the basics?

189
00:08:50,878 --> 00:08:52,838
Show us how to defend
ourself against a baby

190
00:08:52,922 --> 00:08:55,674
and then like
a fifth-grade girl

191
00:08:55,758 --> 00:08:58,885
and then, you know, if we have
time on up to a scary man

192
00:08:59,011 --> 00:09:03,223
The most common scenario is a larger
man attacking a smaller female

193
00:09:03,349 --> 00:09:08,019
So in that scenario
what if the victim

194
00:09:08,104 --> 00:09:10,313
sucker punches
the attacker in the face?

195
00:09:10,606 --> 00:09:13,775
What can the attacker then do
to better protect himself?

196
00:09:14,026 --> 00:09:15,652
It's interesting
that you're drawn

197
00:09:15,736 --> 00:09:17,571
to the point of
view of the attacker

198
00:09:17,864 --> 00:09:20,574
You would like
The Turn of the Table.

199
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:22,451
Okay? The latest
Chad Flenderman novel

200
00:09:23,619 --> 00:09:26,288
From the point of view of his nemesis, Dr.
Lucifer Woo.

201
00:09:26,372 --> 00:09:28,457
Can I please leave?
I have a rape flute.

202
00:09:28,624 --> 00:09:30,876
All right, well let's try one
simple technique together

203
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:32,669
Okay, why doesn't
everyone stand?

204
00:09:32,753 --> 00:09:34,463
Okay, so
you're being attacked

205
00:09:34,547 --> 00:09:37,549
you've got your hands up
simple palm strike to the chin

206
00:09:37,842 --> 00:09:40,051
Up to the chin
One, two

207
00:09:40,386 --> 00:09:41,761
One, two

208
00:09:42,263 --> 00:09:44,222
One, two

209
00:09:44,849 --> 00:09:48,477
Cathy, I would like to introduce
you to Fatty Gruesome

210
00:09:48,561 --> 00:09:51,062
He is a freelancer
for Wired magazine

211
00:09:51,564 --> 00:09:53,148
Patty Grossman
I'm a woman.

212
00:09:53,357 --> 00:09:54,691
But you still work
for Wired, right?

213
00:09:54,775 --> 00:09:55,901
Yes
Good.

214
00:09:55,985 --> 00:09:57,527
Okay. Flirt away

215
00:09:59,071 --> 00:10:01,740
Sabre. It's time
to come home.

216
00:10:05,411 --> 00:10:06,620
Yeah

217
00:10:07,455 --> 00:10:10,415
Yeah. I mean, I think It seemed
like you were a little nervous.

218
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:11,750
Yeah, no * Sherlock

219
00:10:11,834 --> 00:10:13,418
Can somebody please tell
me something encouraging

220
00:10:13,503 --> 00:10:14,586
about this presentation

221
00:10:14,670 --> 00:10:16,671
before I go out there in front
of a million people and do it?

222
00:10:16,756 --> 00:10:17,797
Okay. I know!
I know, champ

223
00:10:17,882 --> 00:10:19,799
Just calm down
because, listen

224
00:10:19,884 --> 00:10:21,593
when you are out in
front of a those people

225
00:10:21,677 --> 00:10:22,677
Yeah, what?

226
00:10:22,762 --> 00:10:23,803
you just
need to realize

227
00:10:23,888 --> 00:10:27,015
so much rides on this

228
00:10:27,099 --> 00:10:28,725
You have no idea

229
00:10:28,809 --> 00:10:29,851
Dwight

230
00:10:29,936 --> 00:10:31,269
I'm trying to make
him feel important

231
00:10:31,938 --> 00:10:34,898
I wish Kelly were here.
She always knew what to say

232
00:10:35,691 --> 00:10:36,775
Um

233
00:10:37,944 --> 00:10:40,529
Oh, Ryan, you're so smart

234
00:10:40,613 --> 00:10:42,322
You're smarter
than Mark Zuckerberg

235
00:10:42,406 --> 00:10:44,449
and those Google guys
all combined.

236
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:48,286
You're so ignorant. You barely
know what you're talking about.

237
00:10:48,496 --> 00:10:50,121
It's so ridiculous

238
00:10:50,581 --> 00:10:52,541
You really need to
read a couple of books

239
00:10:52,792 --> 00:10:54,125
What's a book?

240
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:56,628
Oh, my God
You're so embarrassing

241
00:10:57,421 --> 00:10:59,756
My mom would say
the best stuff though

242
00:11:06,889 --> 00:11:08,098
You can

243
00:11:09,225 --> 00:11:10,350
You can do it, Ryan

244
00:11:10,518 --> 00:11:12,852
And you know that
I'm capable of this?

245
00:11:12,937 --> 00:11:15,230
You're the only one
who can do it, sweetie

246
00:11:15,314 --> 00:11:17,482
What did you think
of the presentation?

247
00:11:17,567 --> 00:11:19,234
I thought
it was great, sweetie

248
00:11:20,278 --> 00:11:21,736
I would just
fix that one

249
00:11:21,821 --> 00:11:23,572
"Fix" means you hate it I knew it!

250
00:11:23,656 --> 00:11:24,864
I need something
to drink!

251
00:11:24,949 --> 00:11:26,116
Jim, get him a water

252
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,492
No, not a water
a sports drink!

253
00:11:27,577 --> 00:11:28,827
I hate everything
in that fridge

254
00:11:28,911 --> 00:11:31,246
Not red! Get me something
yellow or green

255
00:11:31,330 --> 00:11:33,123
from a nearby store
Not red!

256
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:35,417
Why are you just
standing there?

257
00:11:35,501 --> 00:11:38,003
Go to a nearby store and get him
a yellow or green sports drink.

258
00:11:40,715 --> 00:11:43,633
Now if your attacker is
willing to defile a corpse

259
00:11:43,718 --> 00:11:46,011
you better stop
playing dead right away

260
00:11:46,137 --> 00:11:47,804
and just make it known
that you're alive

261
00:11:47,930 --> 00:11:49,556
Forgive me
for interrupting

262
00:11:49,932 --> 00:11:52,934
had an altercation
with somebody here

263
00:11:53,019 --> 00:11:55,562
some fancy gentleman
with a squeaky voice?

264
00:11:55,646 --> 00:11:57,689
I think you guys might
have the wrong office

265
00:11:57,773 --> 00:11:59,608
That's him.
The guy I hit

266
00:11:59,692 --> 00:12:00,734
What?

267
00:12:00,818 --> 00:12:02,444
You've got to be
kidding me.

268
00:12:02,528 --> 00:12:03,862
Poor Andy

269
00:12:04,822 --> 00:12:08,116
First you got beat up by a gang
and now she kicks your ass

270
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,159
No, Kevin

271
00:12:09,243 --> 00:12:11,244
What about the lady
you hit with a pinecone?

272
00:12:11,329 --> 00:12:12,871
There.
That chubby one

273
00:12:15,249 --> 00:12:16,458
Yesterday?

274
00:12:16,709 --> 00:12:18,460
Wow.
Apologize

275
00:12:19,045 --> 00:12:22,213
Sorry I kicked your ass in front
of your "thin" girlfriend

276
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:24,549
How about we wait until next
year after you have your kid?

277
00:12:24,842 --> 00:12:26,843
You know what? Tiffany's
going to college

278
00:12:26,927 --> 00:12:29,346
Listen I don't know what you
guys are talking about,

279
00:12:29,430 --> 00:12:33,058
but I guess I' just accept your
apology so we can get on with our day

280
00:12:33,309 --> 00:12:36,394
God bless. A friend of
mine uses your paper

281
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:37,646
You do good work

282
00:12:38,856 --> 00:12:40,106
Bye-bye.
Bye

283
00:12:40,691 --> 00:12:43,818
So, Toby, I think we should do a
different self-defense seminar

284
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:46,363
how to protect ourselves
against tiny little girls.

285
00:12:46,530 --> 00:12:49,616
There's no shame in getting
beaten up by a girl

286
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:51,743
My ex-wife used
to demolish me.

287
00:12:52,036 --> 00:12:53,370
No, there is
shame in it, okay?

288
00:12:53,454 --> 00:12:55,163
We have to draw the
line somewhere.

289
00:12:55,247 --> 00:12:57,582
Oh, my God I think I see
the imprint of a Ring Pop

290
00:12:57,833 --> 00:12:59,000
Oh

291
00:13:01,003 --> 00:13:02,253
Have you seen Erin?

292
00:13:02,338 --> 00:13:03,546
I'm on break

293
00:13:06,759 --> 00:13:07,759
Oh, my God

294
00:13:08,052 --> 00:13:09,719
No, hey, bloggers, where
do you think you're going?

295
00:13:09,804 --> 00:13:11,179
No, you got to stay
for the big presentation

296
00:13:11,263 --> 00:13:12,597
We got this
young whiz kid, Ryan

297
00:13:12,682 --> 00:13:14,349
He's like an even
more handsome Bill Gates

298
00:13:14,433 --> 00:13:15,558
When's the presentation?

299
00:13:15,685 --> 00:13:17,310
It's moments away
Just stay here

300
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:19,854
Hey, Uncle Lucas
it's your nephew, Ryan

301
00:13:19,939 --> 00:13:23,024
Honestly, I could use a
prescription for Ritalin right now

302
00:13:23,984 --> 00:13:26,236
Well, I know you did
one for Aunt Carol.

303
00:13:27,530 --> 00:13:29,656
So it's different
because it's your wife?

304
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:31,866
Well, that doesn't
make any sense to me

305
00:13:31,951 --> 00:13:33,660
How are you doing?
Don't talk to me right now

306
00:13:33,744 --> 00:13:35,203
I'm sorry. I know you're my boss

307
00:13:35,287 --> 00:13:36,496
but seriously,
you need to get

308
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:37,956
the hell out of my face

309
00:13:40,793 --> 00:13:44,838
Your little man is unraveling.
Now go and fix it

310
00:13:45,297 --> 00:13:46,881
Sorry about
kicking you out

311
00:13:46,966 --> 00:13:50,218
It's just we don't want our
brand associated with death

312
00:13:50,302 --> 00:13:54,472
It's okay I'll go to the Costco
and search for handsome men

313
00:13:54,974 --> 00:13:56,391
You're not married yet?

314
00:13:56,642 --> 00:14:00,395
Oh, I was. My husband
was my best friend

315
00:14:00,938 --> 00:14:02,188
He passed away

316
00:14:03,983 --> 00:14:06,317
My best friend
was my boss, Andy

317
00:14:06,944 --> 00:14:08,820
We dated for a while
but since then,

318
00:14:08,904 --> 00:14:10,905
he rejected me and
we're not really friends

319
00:14:11,532 --> 00:14:16,202
Someone rejected you? With
that body and those bazongas?

320
00:14:16,579 --> 00:14:17,746
Forget him

321
00:14:18,456 --> 00:14:22,459
Yeah. Forget him And you
should forget your husband

322
00:14:23,043 --> 00:14:24,043
Well

323
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:27,088
How long has he
been in the bathroom?

324
00:14:27,173 --> 00:14:28,298
Like 10 minutes

325
00:14:28,382 --> 00:14:30,091
Geez, what's he
doing in there?

326
00:14:30,176 --> 00:14:31,426
Oh, that's my phone

327
00:14:31,510 --> 00:14:32,761
Am I allowed to answer it or
are you going to freak out?

328
00:14:32,845 --> 00:14:33,845
Are there bloggers around?

329
00:14:34,513 --> 00:14:35,513
It's Ryan

330
00:14:35,848 --> 00:14:38,141
"I'm sorry. I lied
I'm not in the bathroom

331
00:14:38,225 --> 00:14:40,477
"I can't do it I need to see my mom

332
00:14:40,561 --> 00:14:41,686
"I'm going home.'

333
00:14:41,771 --> 00:14:43,855
What is the delay here?

334
00:14:45,191 --> 00:14:46,274
Where is Ryan?

335
00:14:47,026 --> 00:14:48,443
Why is he not here?

336
00:14:51,113 --> 00:14:54,032
As brilliant and
creative as he is

337
00:14:54,158 --> 00:14:57,076
he is nothing
compared to this guy

338
00:14:57,411 --> 00:14:58,411
Uh.

339
00:14:58,954 --> 00:14:59,954
What?

340
00:15:00,039 --> 00:15:01,289
That's right. Will you
just give us a second?

341
00:15:01,373 --> 00:15:03,333
You are going to bloody ruin it.
You're going to bloody ruin it

342
00:15:03,417 --> 00:15:05,877
because you're a no-good,
half-assed, cockeyed numpty

343
00:15:05,961 --> 00:15:07,253
Okay. Okay

344
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:09,714
Jim I'm not doing
the presentation

345
00:15:10,090 --> 00:15:13,593
Look at me. Look at me
Look at this face

346
00:15:13,761 --> 00:15:15,428
This is not
the face of a performer

347
00:15:15,513 --> 00:15:18,723
This is the face of a scary
apparition you see before you die

348
00:15:19,558 --> 00:15:24,854
I'm telling you, if you don't
do this, I don't stand a chance

349
00:15:26,398 --> 00:15:27,482
Please, Jim

350
00:15:33,322 --> 00:15:34,572
Okay, I'll do it

351
00:15:35,658 --> 00:15:39,744
Oh, my God. Okay

352
00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:41,621
Go get into Ryan's costume
and check out his notes.

353
00:15:41,705 --> 00:15:42,747
A costume?

354
00:15:42,832 --> 00:15:44,415
Of course
there's a costume

355
00:15:46,001 --> 00:15:47,377
Oh, this is going
to be great

356
00:15:47,461 --> 00:15:48,753
There's nothing like
some last minute changes

357
00:15:48,838 --> 00:15:51,548
to really energize
a presentation. Huh?

358
00:16:03,853 --> 00:16:06,020
Did you pass out in there?
What is taking so long?

359
00:16:06,105 --> 00:16:07,814
I've been in here
for 20 seconds.

360
00:16:07,898 --> 00:16:10,775
Hurry up! Let me in I want
to watch you get dressed.

361
00:16:11,026 --> 00:16:13,069
Did you find
the eyeliner?

362
00:16:13,946 --> 00:16:15,029
I'm not wearing eyeliner

363
00:16:15,114 --> 00:16:17,240
You are wearing
eyeliner, Jim.

364
00:16:26,458 --> 00:16:30,670
Time, space, gender

365
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:32,297
There are no rules
anymore.

366
00:16:32,923 --> 00:16:34,799
All boundaries
are breaking down

367
00:16:35,301 --> 00:16:37,927
in the wake of
the infinite future

368
00:16:39,388 --> 00:16:42,557
The only thing that The
only thing that remains...

369
00:16:42,766 --> 00:16:44,058
The only thing
that remains

370
00:16:44,143 --> 00:16:46,561
are the things that have
stood the test of time

371
00:16:46,645 --> 00:16:51,149
Love, values and of
course the Pyramids

372
00:16:51,817 --> 00:16:54,652
The strongest shape
ever constructed.

373
00:16:54,904 --> 00:16:59,073
A shape that fits all other
shapes inside of it.

374
00:16:59,158 --> 00:17:00,241
No, that's

375
00:17:00,326 --> 00:17:01,367
Mmm. It's true

376
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:07,290
This is the future
because this is the past

377
00:17:08,334 --> 00:17:10,460
I've been through a lot
of issues in my life

378
00:17:11,086 --> 00:17:15,089
I've seen drug addiction
unemployment

379
00:17:15,716 --> 00:17:18,551
I've been in a relationship
that tore my heart apart

380
00:17:18,636 --> 00:17:22,513
without ever being able to
accept that love drove the pain

381
00:17:23,015 --> 00:17:24,515
Yep

382
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:28,519
When I was 10 years old my
parents took me to Disney world

383
00:17:31,941 --> 00:17:36,194
I was not able to comprehend
the beauty that was before me

384
00:17:40,199 --> 00:17:43,451
This is what the Pyramid
will do for you.

385
00:17:43,827 --> 00:17:46,871
It is the bridge
to the world.

386
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:48,873
It has the USB port

387
00:17:49,083 --> 00:17:53,169
Wireless will be
available in 2013

388
00:17:54,296 --> 00:17:59,550
You can play anything
from Chuck to Cars 2.

389
00:18:01,595 --> 00:18:06,724
With the Pyramid, you have
the connection to everything

390
00:18:07,643 --> 00:18:10,353
In time and space

391
00:18:14,858 --> 00:18:15,858
Psst

392
00:18:16,986 --> 00:18:18,069
Oh

393
00:18:22,408 --> 00:18:26,119
Sabre. It's time
to come home.

394
00:18:38,590 --> 00:18:41,134
All right.
Thank you so much. Wow

395
00:18:41,927 --> 00:18:43,011
Wow

396
00:18:44,346 --> 00:18:45,471
And good night

397
00:18:46,932 --> 00:18:47,932
Yeah

398
00:18:53,439 --> 00:18:55,189
Okay, this isn't over
Let's stay focused, okay?

399
00:18:55,274 --> 00:18:58,443
We made fun of Andy earlier for
getting beat up by a little girl

400
00:18:59,069 --> 00:19:01,112
but little things
can be dangerous

401
00:19:01,196 --> 00:19:04,282
Whether it's a gremlin
or Chucky the doll,

402
00:19:04,450 --> 00:19:07,535
the key is to
throw it in something

403
00:19:07,619 --> 00:19:10,955
like a fireplace or
a tub of electricity

404
00:19:11,373 --> 00:19:13,166
Okay, good point. Um

405
00:19:13,459 --> 00:19:16,586
Good point? What is a
tub of electricity?

406
00:19:17,337 --> 00:19:18,796
With all due respect

407
00:19:18,881 --> 00:19:20,548
we know what we're
defending against

408
00:19:20,632 --> 00:19:22,300
It's a 12-year-old
female bully.

409
00:19:24,344 --> 00:19:27,221
Great! I think Kelly
should attack Toby

410
00:19:27,306 --> 00:19:28,389
Yeah

411
00:19:28,474 --> 00:19:29,682
Yeah, that's not
a bad idea actually

412
00:19:29,767 --> 00:19:31,809
because I have had
a lot of pent-up aggression

413
00:19:31,894 --> 00:19:33,436
Thanks.
- Good! Go

414
00:19:33,562 --> 00:19:34,771
I don't know whether
this is gonna help

415
00:19:34,897 --> 00:19:36,147
All right, Kelly

416
00:19:36,565 --> 00:19:38,900
We should stay to maybe some
more traditional models.

417
00:19:38,984 --> 00:19:40,318
You think
you're so pretty?

418
00:19:40,402 --> 00:19:42,487
You're not going to be
so pretty come prom-time

419
00:19:42,613 --> 00:19:44,030
Okay, this is what's
called Take that!

420
00:19:44,114 --> 00:19:45,490
pre-violent posture
Take that

421
00:19:45,949 --> 00:19:47,784
Not so pre-violent
anymore

422
00:19:47,868 --> 00:19:50,536
I'm in what's called
the decision point.

423
00:19:50,704 --> 00:19:51,871
Hey, hey, hey
Kelly! Kelly!

424
00:19:52,498 --> 00:19:53,664
Ow

425
00:19:53,832 --> 00:19:54,999
My good eye

426
00:19:56,001 --> 00:19:57,001
Oh, boy

427
00:19:58,087 --> 00:19:59,462
Oh, no, I'm not
laughing at you

428
00:19:59,546 --> 00:20:02,840
I'm laughing at
something that Cece did

429
00:20:02,925 --> 00:20:06,552
on the playground earlier
yesterday, this morning.

430
00:20:07,429 --> 00:20:09,430
You know why I
got hit by girls?

431
00:20:10,349 --> 00:20:12,809
Because I stood up
for others.

432
00:20:12,893 --> 00:20:14,685
Pam and Toby

433
00:20:16,021 --> 00:20:20,108
didn't care that I was
standing up to girls.

434
00:20:20,192 --> 00:20:25,655
You may want to ask yourselves,
where were you when the girls came?

435
00:20:27,491 --> 00:20:30,118
Tough day, yes
But I feel good

436
00:20:30,202 --> 00:20:32,787
I put the office
in their place

437
00:20:32,871 --> 00:20:36,290
took a bunch of painkillers drank half
a bottle of wine took my pants off.

438
00:20:40,754 --> 00:20:43,131
Okay, okay, I will be
the first to admit it.

439
00:20:43,215 --> 00:20:45,466
We could have integrated more
Chuck into the presentation.

440
00:20:45,551 --> 00:20:48,386
Dwight, you're
the vice president

441
00:20:49,972 --> 00:20:54,559
Yeah
Okay! Come on!

442
00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:56,102
Right on

443
00:20:56,436 --> 00:20:58,062
Bam, bam, bam, bam, bam

444
00:20:58,147 --> 00:20:59,147
Boom
