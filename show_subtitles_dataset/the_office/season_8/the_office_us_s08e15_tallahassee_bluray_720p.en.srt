1
00:00:01,114 --> 00:00:03,282
Today is the first day
of Sabre's new project

2
00:00:03,408 --> 00:00:05,534
to develop a chain
of retail stores.

3
00:00:05,618 --> 00:00:09,413
Nellie Bertram
Head of Special Projects.

4
00:00:10,081 --> 00:00:11,665
Work starts at 9:00.

5
00:00:11,916 --> 00:00:15,377
Sabre HQ is 30 minutes away
driving the speed limit,

6
00:00:15,462 --> 00:00:17,713
giving everyone 20
minutes to shower,

7
00:00:17,839 --> 00:00:20,090
plus 50 for Jim
to style his hair,

8
00:00:20,175 --> 00:00:24,428
20 for breakfast, 40 for Erin to get
post between her room and the lobby,

9
00:00:24,512 --> 00:00:27,139
90 for Ryan to do
his morning ecstasy.

10
00:00:28,266 --> 00:00:30,142
We're already 20 minutes late

11
00:00:36,483 --> 00:00:38,984
Wake up!

12
00:00:42,238 --> 00:00:44,865
Hey, hey, hey
hey, wake up! Ow

13
00:00:45,992 --> 00:00:47,493
Why are you sleeping
that way?

14
00:00:47,577 --> 00:00:50,871
Oh. I was reading the mattress
tag and I fell asleep.

15
00:00:51,331 --> 00:00:55,417
Stanley! Wake up You've got to
wake up The hotel's on fire!

16
00:00:55,502 --> 00:00:58,003
Stanley, wake up
It's pretzel day

17
00:01:07,222 --> 00:01:08,222
Good morning

18
00:01:08,306 --> 00:01:12,184
Hey, wake up Let's have some fun.
We're in Florida now

19
00:01:12,268 --> 00:01:14,645
Hey, you. I'm so
glad this is happening

20
00:01:14,771 --> 00:01:17,147
door twice last night

21
00:01:17,232 --> 00:01:19,358
Come on in,
the water's fine

22
00:01:19,609 --> 00:01:21,068
Oh, not coo

23
00:01:21,611 --> 00:01:26,115
sleep schedule, so I'm
up and at 'em at 4:15

24
00:01:26,199 --> 00:01:29,827
But no kids, so I honestly didn't
know what to do with myself

25
00:01:30,495 --> 00:01:32,329
And then I thought
of something. Uh

26
00:01:33,373 --> 00:01:36,291
Here is Dwight
What the

27
00:01:38,711 --> 00:01:40,045
Oh, man

28
00:01:40,171 --> 00:01:41,505
What do you think happened?

29
00:01:42,382 --> 00:01:44,842
Looks like Jim got mixed up
with some bad apples.

30
00:01:45,885 --> 00:01:48,595
Oh, no, no, no, no
It wasn't me

31
00:01:49,889 --> 00:01:52,558
at the Alcohol Club."

32
00:02:18,084 --> 00:02:19,710
Puppet
Cool. For your kids?

33
00:02:19,794 --> 00:02:22,546
Yeah. It's weird being away from them.
I've never done this before

34
00:02:23,006 --> 00:02:26,717
Attention Dunder Mifflin
group proceed outside.

35
00:02:27,093 --> 00:02:29,887
The vehicle is waiting
Seats have been assigned

36
00:02:29,971 --> 00:02:31,513
Shotgun goes to Ryan

37
00:02:31,598 --> 00:02:33,640
Congratulations, Ryan

38
00:02:36,102 --> 00:02:38,228
I need to make Nellie
see me as a leader today.

39
00:02:38,396 --> 00:02:40,772
First impressions
get locked in forever

40
00:02:41,107 --> 00:02:42,941
When I first met Pam
she said something

41
00:02:43,067 --> 00:02:44,860
that slightly
rubbed me the wrong way

42
00:02:44,944 --> 00:02:47,154
Since then I've
loved working with Pam

43
00:02:47,238 --> 00:02:48,906
and she's frankly wonderful

44
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:50,199
but I hate her

45
00:02:51,242 --> 00:02:52,618
I'll have
a bottle of the antacid

46
00:02:53,119 --> 00:02:54,870
Also I want to get
a souvenir for my son

47
00:02:54,954 --> 00:02:56,580
but his mother doesn't
acknowledge my paternity.

48
00:02:56,664 --> 00:02:57,831
Do you have anything for that?

49
00:02:57,916 --> 00:02:59,791
Also I want it to
have a Florida feel

50
00:02:59,876 --> 00:03:01,418
What does he like?

51
00:03:01,878 --> 00:03:03,170
Power

52
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:08,008
Okay, and this one is, "Huh. Don't
see too many museums around here."

53
00:03:08,092 --> 00:03:10,427
Okay, Twiggy, that's enough
Get in the car.

54
00:03:10,929 --> 00:03:12,054
Hey, are you okay?

55
00:03:12,138 --> 00:03:14,473
I'm fine, okay?
I'm just stressed

56
00:03:14,557 --> 00:03:16,725
because I care
about this project

57
00:03:16,809 --> 00:03:18,227
And frankly,
the fact that none of you

58
00:03:18,353 --> 00:03:19,770
are vomiting or
diarrheal right now

59
00:03:21,022 --> 00:03:23,065
Who says none of
us are diarrheal?

60
00:03:25,401 --> 00:03:27,861
Are you sure it's stress?
Because I did poison you

61
00:03:27,946 --> 00:03:29,321
Very funny, Jim

62
00:03:29,405 --> 00:03:31,114
Oh, no, I'm serious.
I was thinking for this trip

63
00:03:31,199 --> 00:03:33,033
so what should that be?

64
00:03:33,117 --> 00:03:35,035
And then I thought of it
I'll poison you

65
00:03:35,495 --> 00:03:37,287
What are you going to do? Are
you going to steal my newspaper

66
00:03:37,372 --> 00:03:38,789
or put a cricket in my cereal
or something?

67
00:03:39,165 --> 00:03:41,458
I'm gonna set your face on fire.
That's a good one

68
00:03:45,004 --> 00:03:46,713
Whoa. Stanley,
did you just come back

69
00:03:46,798 --> 00:03:48,006
from burning down
a rival night club?

70
00:03:48,091 --> 00:03:49,132
Laugh it up, Halpert

71
00:03:49,217 --> 00:03:53,053
I'm in Florida for a month without
my family I'm going to enjoy this.

72
00:03:53,596 --> 00:03:56,181
Want to get in?
You can work the iPod

73
00:03:56,891 --> 00:03:58,183
Yes

74
00:03:58,893 --> 00:04:02,020
You're a nice guy, Jim but you
have no idea how to vacation.

75
00:04:02,105 --> 00:04:03,188
Find some Kenny Loggins

76
00:04:03,314 --> 00:04:04,398
Loggins and Messina

77
00:04:04,482 --> 00:04:06,275
Did I say Messina?

78
00:04:09,946 --> 00:04:13,240
Sorry, I couldn't
resist It's so quiet.

79
00:04:14,867 --> 00:04:17,577
It's so peaceful, I've already
written 12 plays today

80
00:04:18,121 --> 00:04:22,874
It's so quiet, one might say
you could hear a pin...

81
00:04:25,545 --> 00:04:27,045
would be cooler

82
00:04:28,548 --> 00:04:29,881
Hey, can you pick up
the pin?

83
00:04:29,966 --> 00:04:31,466
Some of us like to
work in our bare feet

84
00:04:31,551 --> 00:04:36,388
Of course. I will pick up
the pin It is right here

85
00:04:38,391 --> 00:04:40,142
Got it Can we see that?
Did you really find it?

86
00:04:40,226 --> 00:04:43,395
Yes. Right here.
Got it. Dink. Ow

87
00:04:45,273 --> 00:04:47,899
In the trash
Hey, why is it so quiet?

88
00:04:47,984 --> 00:04:49,735
Shouldn't
the phone be ringing?

89
00:04:50,778 --> 00:04:51,820
Uh-oh

90
00:04:52,447 --> 00:04:53,905
Erin set
the phone to voice-mail

91
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:55,699
Great.
Oh, my God, we're screwed

92
00:04:56,034 --> 00:04:58,493
There

93
00:04:58,578 --> 00:05:00,787
Oh, there we go. Pam?

94
00:05:00,872 --> 00:05:02,205
Yeah

95
00:05:02,332 --> 00:05:03,665
Can you get the phone?

96
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:05,083
Well, I'm not
the receptionist

97
00:05:05,209 --> 00:05:06,501
Well, you used to be

98
00:05:07,295 --> 00:05:10,839
I know but I can't cover reception
I have a ton of work to do.

99
00:05:10,965 --> 00:05:12,758
Phone's ringing

100
00:05:14,093 --> 00:05:17,763
Will one of you get the phone? I am
freaking out! I know it's for me.

101
00:05:22,977 --> 00:05:25,854
Are you guys kidding me? Stop
flirting and someone get the phone

102
00:05:25,938 --> 00:05:27,230
Answer the phone

103
00:05:27,315 --> 00:05:28,565
Pick up the phone

104
00:05:28,691 --> 00:05:29,900
Andy, you're standing up

105
00:05:29,984 --> 00:05:31,109
You're the closest one to it

106
00:05:31,235 --> 00:05:32,319
Fine

107
00:05:32,653 --> 00:05:34,654
Hello. Dunder Mifflin

108
00:05:34,947 --> 00:05:37,282
Hello, you've reached Dunder Mifflin.
How may I be of service?

109
00:05:39,035 --> 00:05:40,660
How was the drive?
Fantastic

110
00:05:40,745 --> 00:05:41,870
Stanley drives so fast

111
00:05:41,954 --> 00:05:46,041
Life is short. Drive fast leave a
sexy corpse. That's one of my mottos

112
00:05:47,293 --> 00:05:49,378
I would love to
hear the other mottos

113
00:05:50,630 --> 00:05:51,671
Quick query, Halpert

114
00:05:51,798 --> 00:05:52,839
No way

115
00:05:52,924 --> 00:05:54,216
Still queer?

116
00:05:54,926 --> 00:05:55,967
Packer

117
00:05:56,052 --> 00:05:58,804
You can't put me down
Too strong

118
00:06:00,473 --> 00:06:03,308
Yeah, Dwight and Jim
tried to get me fired.

119
00:06:03,393 --> 00:06:05,852
But I landed on my
feet down here in Florida

120
00:06:05,978 --> 00:06:09,147
You see, this cat's got
nine lives and a nine-inch

121
00:06:09,732 --> 00:06:13,652
Say, "So who's
leading this thing anyway?'

122
00:06:14,779 --> 00:06:16,863
So who's leading
this thing anyway?

123
00:06:19,117 --> 00:06:22,119
Psst. Say,
"I can't wait to meet him.'

124
00:06:24,372 --> 00:06:29,751
"Him," you said? Don't think
a woman can be a leader?

125
00:06:31,045 --> 00:06:34,423
L
You poor, simple boy

126
00:06:34,507 --> 00:06:36,049
Expected a man, did you?

127
00:06:36,134 --> 00:06:42,055
Strong, powerful huge whopping penis?
Well, sorry to disappoint

128
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:46,643
But my huge whopping penis is right
here and I'm not afraid to use it

129
00:06:47,562 --> 00:06:52,149
So stop looking at my breasts
and start looking at my penis.

130
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:59,281
I'm Nellie Bertram
President of Special Projects

131
00:06:59,657 --> 00:07:01,074
In the next few weeks
we're going to throw

132
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,659
everything you
know about business

133
00:07:02,743 --> 00:07:05,245
out of the window
and do it our own way

134
00:07:05,705 --> 00:07:07,664
Are your minds blown?

135
00:07:07,748 --> 00:07:11,168
So, how did this special
project come about anyway?

136
00:07:11,252 --> 00:07:17,549
Well, I interviewed to be
the manager of your branch

137
00:07:17,925 --> 00:07:21,970
After you decided I
wasn't a good fit...

138
00:07:22,054 --> 00:07:23,555
It was
Ah. Mmm-mmm

139
00:07:24,056 --> 00:07:26,558
It was. I went
on a shopping spree

140
00:07:26,684 --> 00:07:29,144
Very destructive, I bought 1/ pianos

141
00:07:29,228 --> 00:07:32,856
Then I realized, what if
Sabre had a store? Hmm?

142
00:07:33,608 --> 00:07:37,444
So I called Jo old friend,
founder of Sabre and I told her,

143
00:07:37,528 --> 00:07:40,489
and she grabbed me by the
shoulders and she said, "Yes!'

144
00:07:40,907 --> 00:07:42,949
So let's talk about
this Sabre store then

145
00:07:43,493 --> 00:07:45,994
Probably going to
look stupid, right?

146
00:07:46,078 --> 00:07:48,663
Like a big turd with a door
on the front, right?

147
00:07:48,748 --> 00:07:50,248
What do you think
it should look like?

148
00:07:50,374 --> 00:07:53,335
It might be fun if each
store had a different theme

149
00:07:53,419 --> 00:07:55,795
like a beach one,
a winter one, a jungle one

150
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:57,714
No. Not a big fan of
the winter aesthetic

151
00:07:57,798 --> 00:07:59,633
Well, that was just one idea
It doesn't have to be winter.

152
00:07:59,717 --> 00:08:01,593
Oh, no, it does. It does

153
00:08:01,677 --> 00:08:04,262
It has to be winter
and I reject it

154
00:08:04,889 --> 00:08:09,601
So I drew up a design concept
probably going to be rubbish, right?

155
00:08:10,603 --> 00:08:13,188
Would you like to look at it?
Just so you can laugh at it

156
00:08:13,272 --> 00:08:14,314
Yeah

157
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:15,524
Let me just get
the projector working

158
00:08:17,026 --> 00:08:19,653
You got to stop with the
antacids It's not the antidote

159
00:08:20,279 --> 00:08:21,905
You didn't poison me
It's just stress.

160
00:08:21,989 --> 00:08:23,281
Okay

161
00:08:23,407 --> 00:08:24,658
What is the antidote?

162
00:08:24,742 --> 00:08:26,034
True love's kiss

163
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,494
Jim, help me
lower this screen

164
00:08:27,703 --> 00:08:29,538
You're a big tall man

165
00:08:29,622 --> 00:08:32,707
You'd be hilarious trying
to do it like a little boy.

166
00:08:33,084 --> 00:08:34,668
Just let go of his balloon

167
00:08:34,961 --> 00:08:37,045
I'll do it.

168
00:08:37,129 --> 00:08:40,549
Something done right,
ask Dwight.

169
00:08:40,633 --> 00:08:41,633
Right, Dwight

170
00:08:42,009 --> 00:08:44,135
Right, Dwight.
Right, Dwight. Right, Dwight

171
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:46,721
Sorry. Now you'll never be able
to get that out of your head

172
00:08:56,774 --> 00:08:57,899
There we go

173
00:09:03,155 --> 00:09:06,032
Yes, a complete inability
to pass gas, pervert.

174
00:09:06,534 --> 00:09:10,453
Yeah, it's tender, but it can't be
appendicitis. I eat more than enough bacon

175
00:09:10,830 --> 00:09:14,332
Okay, what poison mimics the
symptoms of appendicitis?

176
00:09:14,458 --> 00:09:15,667
You don't know. Hold on

177
00:09:22,508 --> 00:09:24,217
What kind of
poison did you use?

178
00:09:24,885 --> 00:09:27,804
Dwight, I didn't poison you I was kidding

179
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:33,435
Yeah, I'm going to
need an ambulance

180
00:09:34,353 --> 00:09:36,855
Hold on. I have the address
in my phone Hold on.

181
00:09:38,190 --> 00:09:39,482
Sabre has assigned
Hold on one second

182
00:09:39,567 --> 00:09:41,109
the following positions
in the retail division.

183
00:09:41,193 --> 00:09:42,360
Uh, quick question

184
00:09:42,486 --> 00:09:45,905
Vice President, who is that?
There is no name listed.

185
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:49,868
Is there not? Maybe I'm just
waiting for someone to wow me

186
00:09:53,331 --> 00:09:55,999
Sir? Sir, where should
we send the ambulance?

187
00:09:56,417 --> 00:09:58,752
Send it to
the freaking moon, idiot

188
00:10:00,212 --> 00:10:02,964
I'll tell you what, though
since my move down to Florida

189
00:10:03,049 --> 00:10:05,216
I've really gotten back
into hunting, big-time.

190
00:10:05,676 --> 00:10:09,262
Hunting's so primal almost sexual
- Totally.

191
00:10:09,347 --> 00:10:10,972
Yeah, I mean
I'd never bang an animal

192
00:10:11,057 --> 00:10:12,098
You can hardly
tell the difference

193
00:10:12,224 --> 00:10:13,308
between a boy or a girl
you know?

194
00:10:13,392 --> 00:10:14,809
But hunting's intense

195
00:10:14,935 --> 00:10:16,311
You talking about hunting?

196
00:10:16,395 --> 00:10:17,937
I'm a master hunter

197
00:10:18,814 --> 00:10:20,023
Did you say "masturbator"?

198
00:10:20,107 --> 00:10:22,776
I'm a decent baiter. My cousin,
Mose, that's a master baiter

199
00:10:23,069 --> 00:10:24,903
Why are you
sitting down like that?

200
00:10:25,404 --> 00:10:27,030
Why is everyone
else standing up?

201
00:10:27,114 --> 00:10:30,367
Okay, team, let's get
back to work Break's over

202
00:10:32,286 --> 00:10:34,287
Wow. Are you that bored?

203
00:10:34,789 --> 00:10:37,457
It's just rum
I'm not bored. I'm a pirate

204
00:10:37,667 --> 00:10:39,209
Is that another motto?

205
00:10:39,335 --> 00:10:40,877
It's whatever you want

206
00:10:41,253 --> 00:10:42,253
Hmm

207
00:10:42,463 --> 00:10:43,755
Or do you only
drink with your kids?

208
00:10:43,923 --> 00:10:45,256
No, let's do it

209
00:10:45,383 --> 00:10:46,466
Woah. That's healthy

210
00:10:46,801 --> 00:10:48,968
I've spent so much of
my life telling myself,

211
00:10:49,095 --> 00:10:51,262
"Please, don't
end up like Stanley.'

212
00:10:52,932 --> 00:10:56,434
And now I'm wondering
if I even have what it takes

213
00:10:57,311 --> 00:11:03,274
We have the Sabre pyramid, right?
We've got a bunch of humans

214
00:11:03,442 --> 00:11:06,444
You guys. Humans, pyramid

215
00:11:06,737 --> 00:11:08,947
Human pyramid. Do you follow?

216
00:11:09,031 --> 00:11:11,783
It's a team-building exercise

217
00:11:11,992 --> 00:11:13,451
You love it. Who's in?

218
00:11:14,954 --> 00:11:16,371
Tallahassee, let's go

219
00:11:16,455 --> 00:11:17,539
Jim, are you in?

220
00:11:17,623 --> 00:11:18,957
Oh, I don't know

221
00:11:19,083 --> 00:11:20,417
Sounds like a hoot. I'm in

222
00:11:20,835 --> 00:11:23,294
All right
What the heck? Let's do it

223
00:11:23,713 --> 00:11:25,714
This is great.
This is going to be great

224
00:11:25,798 --> 00:11:27,465
I feel like I'm
in ancient Egypt.

225
00:11:28,384 --> 00:11:30,760
I'll be on top That's the
most important position

226
00:11:30,845 --> 00:11:32,846
Dude, I think you have appendicitis.

227
00:11:33,264 --> 00:11:35,140
Dwight,
why don't we just hold off

228
00:11:35,266 --> 00:11:37,142
with the human
pyramids for a while?

229
00:11:37,226 --> 00:11:39,269
Everyone stop moving.
Everyone stop wiggling

230
00:11:39,353 --> 00:11:40,562
going to vomit

231
00:11:40,646 --> 00:11:42,772
Dude, don't you yak on me
This shirt is Van Heusen

232
00:11:42,857 --> 00:11:43,940
Oh, stop moving

233
00:11:44,483 --> 00:11:46,985
No one's moving.

234
00:11:50,489 --> 00:11:52,365
Arrest Jim.
He poisoned me

235
00:11:52,575 --> 00:11:55,243
What? No. No
It was not a poisoning

236
00:11:55,327 --> 00:11:57,370
The one thing Pam
made sure I knew,

237
00:11:57,496 --> 00:11:59,581
Florida's pretty loose
with the death penalty

238
00:11:59,749 --> 00:12:01,499
You need an operation
You have appendicitis

239
00:12:01,584 --> 00:12:04,169
Oh! Who called it?
Nothing but net

240
00:12:04,253 --> 00:12:05,503
How long will he be gone?

241
00:12:05,629 --> 00:12:06,880
Two or three days

242
00:12:07,465 --> 00:12:09,090
Don't remember me like this

243
00:12:09,175 --> 00:12:11,760
Remember me as the man
who pulled down the screen

244
00:12:11,844 --> 00:12:12,927
Drama queen, am I right?

245
00:12:16,265 --> 00:12:18,683
Philip, if you're
hearing this memo

246
00:12:18,851 --> 00:12:21,269
that can only mean
one thing, I am dead

247
00:12:21,562 --> 00:12:26,274
You are the rightful heir to Schrute Farms.
Please, you must do one thing

248
00:12:26,358 --> 00:12:28,860
Kill Mose before he kills you

249
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:34,866
Mose. Hey, it's Dwight

250
00:12:34,950 --> 00:12:36,534
Listen, yeah, I just want
to give you a heads up

251
00:12:36,619 --> 00:12:37,994
That was
an interesting diversion

252
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,537
Should we get
back to the meeting?

253
00:12:40,623 --> 00:12:42,415
Woah. Are those mini pizzas?

254
00:12:42,541 --> 00:12:44,667
Yeah. I figure if
we keep things savory

255
00:12:44,794 --> 00:12:46,920
while Oscar's mouth
is in canker country

256
00:12:47,004 --> 00:12:49,255
bacon-wrapped dates
on deck.

257
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:53,426
Look at these little mini pizzas.
Does this make me look huge?

258
00:12:54,553 --> 00:12:57,639
Hey, guys
look at me, I'm huge.

259
00:12:58,432 --> 00:13:01,017
Hey, Darryl, good news
your fax went through.

260
00:13:01,227 --> 00:13:03,561
Oh yeah

261
00:13:03,646 --> 00:13:04,729
Up high

262
00:13:04,897 --> 00:13:05,980
Yes, sir. Thanks.

263
00:13:06,232 --> 00:13:09,526
Dunder Mifflin, this is Andy. I put
out some new magazines Check it out

264
00:13:09,652 --> 00:13:11,110
Ah, Dwell.

265
00:13:15,032 --> 00:13:17,909
I'm acting like I like Reception,
and I'm a really good actor

266
00:13:17,993 --> 00:13:21,454
so people are actually buying
that p actually like Reception.

267
00:13:21,539 --> 00:13:24,415
But I mean,
seriously, Reception sucks

268
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:26,084
Ooh! There's the phone

269
00:13:27,127 --> 00:13:28,586
I just
got out of surgery

270
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:30,964
What's going on? Fill me in

271
00:13:31,257 --> 00:13:34,259
Well, we broke into groups and the
groups are giving presentations later.

272
00:13:34,593 --> 00:13:36,094
Who's doing the presentations?

273
00:13:36,595 --> 00:13:37,762
Packer's giving one

274
00:13:38,013 --> 00:13:39,597
Jim will probably
give ours, I guess.

275
00:13:39,723 --> 00:13:40,723
Damn it

276
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:43,685
Let's see
What else have you missed?

277
00:13:43,894 --> 00:13:46,062
Ryan switched his
name tag to his pants

278
00:13:46,146 --> 00:13:47,605
so now it's like
if you wear yours

279
00:13:47,731 --> 00:13:49,148
on your shirt
you're a total dip

280
00:13:49,233 --> 00:13:51,317
But if you switch
you're a copycat

281
00:13:51,443 --> 00:13:53,570
But I think I
figured out a solution

282
00:13:54,738 --> 00:13:57,448
What else? My shoes are...

283
00:13:58,033 --> 00:14:00,285
features the tech support
area Bring in your product,

284
00:14:00,369 --> 00:14:02,871
a bunch of nerdy
virgins fix it on the spot

285
00:14:02,955 --> 00:14:04,289
Huge for building loyalty

286
00:14:04,373 --> 00:14:06,124
Yes, that is
a very good point

287
00:14:06,208 --> 00:14:07,834
Yeah, Todd, decent idea

288
00:14:08,586 --> 00:14:10,920
Obvious, but interesting

289
00:14:11,046 --> 00:14:12,589
Dwight, are you all right?

290
00:14:12,715 --> 00:14:14,173
I'm great. How are you?

291
00:14:18,804 --> 00:14:19,804
Uh.

292
00:14:21,974 --> 00:14:23,474
What's our presentation about?

293
00:14:23,559 --> 00:14:24,684
Dwight, will you go
back to the hospital?

294
00:14:24,768 --> 00:14:26,185
You were there for
like three hours.

295
00:14:26,270 --> 00:14:27,812
I got the surgery.
What else is there to do?

296
00:14:28,063 --> 00:14:29,814
Do 100 jumping jacks
No. I don't feel like it.

297
00:14:29,899 --> 00:14:31,107
You do 100 jumping jacks

298
00:14:32,610 --> 00:14:34,986
ninety-seven, 98, 99

299
00:14:36,822 --> 00:14:38,114
You haven't done
any of the research

300
00:14:38,198 --> 00:14:40,909
You're too slow. You're too small.
Seabiscuit is a stupid name

301
00:14:40,993 --> 00:14:42,660
You guys sound just like
the enemies of Seabiscuit

302
00:14:42,953 --> 00:14:44,203
I'm going to do it

303
00:14:44,288 --> 00:14:45,788
Oh, let him do it

304
00:14:46,916 --> 00:14:47,999
Stanley,
are you listening to music?

305
00:14:48,167 --> 00:14:49,250
Yep

306
00:14:50,336 --> 00:14:53,087
All right, who's ready
for the next presentation?

307
00:14:53,422 --> 00:14:55,340
Oh... What is your topic?

308
00:14:56,383 --> 00:14:59,260
What is our topic? Oh, what
a topic it is. Mmm-hmm

309
00:14:59,470 --> 00:15:00,845
Retail consumer habits

310
00:15:01,305 --> 00:15:02,889
Really? Okay

311
00:15:03,182 --> 00:15:05,642
Retail consumer habits is

312
00:15:08,354 --> 00:15:09,395
The only thing
you need to know

313
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:10,772
about retail
consumer habits is that

314
00:15:10,856 --> 00:15:13,274
consumers are
mindless lemmings

315
00:15:13,359 --> 00:15:15,860
They just want to
be told what to do

316
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:22,408
Fast-forward to today and the
retail consumer is independent

317
00:15:22,701 --> 00:15:26,829
well-informed, super smart
Super smart

318
00:15:27,539 --> 00:15:28,539
Okay

319
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:34,629
Shopping habits are both
seasonal and cyclical

320
00:15:34,713 --> 00:15:35,838
What does this mean?

321
00:15:37,132 --> 00:15:38,216
No, sit down

322
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:43,012
Seasonal, well, the Christmas shopping
season is certainly a busy one.

323
00:15:43,097 --> 00:15:44,806
Back to school is as well

324
00:15:44,890 --> 00:15:47,141
and in early summer
it seems to slow down a bit

325
00:15:47,226 --> 00:15:48,977
But shopping is also cyclical

326
00:15:49,061 --> 00:15:53,314
The menstrual cycle determines
every choice a woman makes.

327
00:15:53,732 --> 00:15:58,736
You see, during ovulation a woman's
only goal is to get pregnant.

328
00:15:58,946 --> 00:16:02,407
During menses she is sad
that she has failed.

329
00:16:02,533 --> 00:16:05,326
And how does
the woman console herself?

330
00:16:05,411 --> 00:16:07,787
Shopping. Shopping

331
00:16:07,871 --> 00:16:10,748
Just, Jim, could you fetch me
some ice chips?

332
00:16:13,419 --> 00:16:18,006
Thank you. Just gonna take a
brief pause at this point

333
00:16:18,590 --> 00:16:19,590
Thank you

334
00:16:21,093 --> 00:16:22,510
Oh, God

335
00:16:25,556 --> 00:16:26,764
Next slide

336
00:16:29,226 --> 00:16:30,852
Mail call

337
00:16:30,936 --> 00:16:33,980
His name is Oscar,
and he's got some mail

338
00:16:34,064 --> 00:16:38,026
And he better open it or go to
jail, 'cause it's your taxes

339
00:16:38,110 --> 00:16:41,195
His name is Kevin,
and no mail for him

340
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:44,532
But he got a coupon
for some frozen yogurt

341
00:16:45,951 --> 00:16:47,535
Are those the lyrics?

342
00:16:47,619 --> 00:16:49,454
"Anderson's Three Pillars
of Retail."

343
00:16:49,538 --> 00:16:51,789
Crucial. So important

344
00:16:54,126 --> 00:16:55,251
Next

345
00:16:56,378 --> 00:16:57,837
Are there any questions?

346
00:16:58,464 --> 00:17:01,507
What are the Three
Pillars of Retail?

347
00:17:03,761 --> 00:17:05,803
Convenience
Ingredients.

348
00:17:06,263 --> 00:17:07,889
Service
Burgers.

349
00:17:08,057 --> 00:17:09,057
Building loyalty

350
00:17:09,183 --> 00:17:10,224
Killing royalty

351
00:17:11,101 --> 00:17:12,518
But truth be told
we should really

352
00:17:12,603 --> 00:17:14,312
disregard
Anderson's Three Pillars

353
00:17:15,022 --> 00:17:17,273
He was later
diagnosed with dementia

354
00:17:17,775 --> 00:17:20,151
You know what is important?

355
00:17:20,235 --> 00:17:24,655
Is Dwight's pillars
and there's only one, desire

356
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:28,618
Do we have a desire
to dominate the retail space?

357
00:17:28,702 --> 00:17:30,745
Not just succeed in it
but to dominate.

358
00:17:30,829 --> 00:17:33,164
And looking around this room
I'm not so sure that we do

359
00:17:33,248 --> 00:17:34,248
But we can get there

360
00:17:34,333 --> 00:17:38,461
And I can lead us there,
and that is all that matters

361
00:17:38,670 --> 00:17:41,172
Very true. Where there's
a will, there's a way.

362
00:17:41,256 --> 00:17:43,966
A passionate night

363
00:17:44,093 --> 00:17:46,761
with Hugh Grant's brother
John Grant

364
00:17:46,845 --> 00:17:50,181
He's older than Hugh
just a little bit uglier.

365
00:17:50,349 --> 00:17:51,557
How did I pull that off?

366
00:17:52,017 --> 00:17:54,143
Sheer force of will

367
00:17:54,228 --> 00:17:55,520
That is very good, Dwight

368
00:17:55,771 --> 00:17:57,897
Thank you very much
Any other questions?

369
00:17:58,440 --> 00:17:59,941
Jim

370
00:18:00,067 --> 00:18:01,567
You are bleeding
through your shirt

371
00:18:02,986 --> 00:18:03,986
Oops

372
00:18:05,572 --> 00:18:08,866
That's embarrassing
Egg on my face

373
00:18:10,702 --> 00:18:11,702
Ah

374
00:18:13,497 --> 00:18:15,498
Hey, having fun?

375
00:18:15,624 --> 00:18:17,625
Yes, I am
as a matter of fact

376
00:18:17,709 --> 00:18:20,545
Oh, I know how it is
I know it's a lot of fun

377
00:18:20,629 --> 00:18:22,713
I don't know how it is.
Andy, this is a lame job

378
00:18:22,798 --> 00:18:24,173
What are you doing here?

379
00:18:26,677 --> 00:18:31,889
Andy, when I was 12 years old we did
a field trip, a lock-in at the zoo.

380
00:18:32,683 --> 00:18:37,603
I was in love with her

381
00:18:38,230 --> 00:18:41,065
But when the sun came up
I knew it wasn't real

382
00:18:41,150 --> 00:18:44,277
because she was ugly
and I had grown tired of her

383
00:18:45,237 --> 00:18:46,737
Reception today

384
00:18:46,905 --> 00:18:48,447
but tomorrow you
won't want to do her

385
00:18:48,532 --> 00:18:50,032
She's a dog

386
00:18:50,951 --> 00:18:52,869
Guys, I don't
like this analogy

387
00:18:54,246 --> 00:18:56,539
Oh, fine

388
00:19:02,671 --> 00:19:03,713
Did you see this?

389
00:19:03,797 --> 00:19:04,797
It's nice

390
00:19:09,261 --> 00:19:10,469
How are you feeling?

391
00:19:10,596 --> 00:19:11,846
Amazing

392
00:19:11,930 --> 00:19:13,431
Just lost four
ounces of appendix

393
00:19:13,557 --> 00:19:15,099
already replaced
it with muscle.

394
00:19:15,559 --> 00:19:17,310
Can I see the wound?

395
00:19:22,774 --> 00:19:25,985
Oh, that's disgusting
That's barely healed.

396
00:19:26,069 --> 00:19:29,030
You're not paying me to heal
You're paying me to kick ass

397
00:19:29,281 --> 00:19:33,784
A few hours ago, your body
was open like a cabinet

398
00:19:34,661 --> 00:19:36,162
That's right
That is amazing

399
00:19:36,246 --> 00:19:37,496
Todd, look at that

400
00:19:37,623 --> 00:19:38,873
Oh, yikes

401
00:19:38,957 --> 00:19:40,082
Incoming

402
00:19:40,209 --> 00:19:41,292
Not so fast

403
00:19:41,376 --> 00:19:42,960
Would you come
in early tomorrow

404
00:19:43,045 --> 00:19:45,129
so we could talk about the
store over breakfast?

405
00:19:45,547 --> 00:19:48,257
A lot to offer.

406
00:19:48,383 --> 00:19:49,634
It would be an honor, ma'am

407
00:19:49,718 --> 00:19:52,678
I'll go ahead and cancel
my post-op checkup right now

408
00:19:54,556 --> 00:19:57,934
the first was to make myself the
clear candidate for Vice President

409
00:19:58,018 --> 00:20:00,686
I achieved that,
no thanks to my appendix

410
00:20:00,771 --> 00:20:03,648
The second was to find a
memorable souvenir for Philip.

411
00:20:03,732 --> 00:20:06,984
For that, I do have
to thank my appendix

412
00:20:18,163 --> 00:20:19,914
Dunder Mifflin, how can I
help you save money on paper?

413
00:20:19,998 --> 00:20:21,666
This is Andrew

414
00:20:21,792 --> 00:20:23,417
Hi, Andrew.
What happened to Erin?

415
00:20:23,502 --> 00:20:26,212
Oh, she's on an assignment in
Florida for a couple weeks.

416
00:20:26,296 --> 00:20:28,422
Oh, good for her.
She's such a sweetheart.

417
00:20:28,548 --> 00:20:30,716
You tell her Donna
Moraski misses her.

418
00:20:35,639 --> 00:20:37,765
Everyone, we have
a very special guest

419
00:20:37,849 --> 00:20:42,270
He turned an idea into a store
into hundreds of stores

420
00:20:42,354 --> 00:20:46,440
of Famous Amos cookies.

421
00:20:46,525 --> 00:20:47,608
Yeah

422
00:20:51,571 --> 00:20:53,364
So I hear
you're all looking to

423
00:20:53,532 --> 00:20:55,366
bake up some dough
in the sales game.

424
00:20:55,659 --> 00:20:58,452
Well, back when I
was regular Amos

425
00:20:58,537 --> 00:20:59,662
What's under the cloth?

426
00:20:59,746 --> 00:21:01,205
We'll get to that

427
00:21:01,331 --> 00:21:02,790
Cookies. I bet you
anything it's cookies

428
00:21:03,208 --> 00:21:04,542
It's cookies

429
00:21:04,626 --> 00:21:07,003
Let me finish my speech first

430
00:21:07,212 --> 00:21:10,673
Oh, we get the gist It's just
success and effort, isn't it?

431
00:21:10,757 --> 00:21:13,592
So just don't be coy.
Make with the cookies

432
00:21:13,677 --> 00:21:16,554
Cookies

433
00:21:18,223 --> 00:21:19,473
Famous, hi

434
00:21:19,558 --> 00:21:22,184
I'm sure you get ideas
for new cookies all the time

435
00:21:22,269 --> 00:21:25,479
But I...
Is it oatmeal with no raisins?

436
00:21:25,564 --> 00:21:26,689
I'm sorry to have
wasted your time

437
00:21:26,815 --> 00:21:27,898
That's okay
Thank you very much
