1
00:00:01,247 --> 00:00:03,332
No, no, no
no, no, no, no

2
00:00:04,626 --> 00:00:07,211
No, no, no, no
no, no, no, no.

3
00:00:07,921 --> 00:00:08,921
No

4
00:00:09,005 --> 00:00:10,631
Okay, fine

5
00:00:10,715 --> 00:00:13,092
Ryan, is something the matter?
Yeah

6
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:15,928
Smokey's dead

7
00:00:16,346 --> 00:00:18,472
Smokey the Bear?

8
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:20,140
Smokey Robinson, Pam

9
00:00:20,225 --> 00:00:21,725
He died like
an hour ago

10
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:22,976
I guess I'm the
first to know

11
00:00:23,561 --> 00:00:25,771
Wow, that's terrible
I really liked him.

12
00:00:25,855 --> 00:00:27,856
Oh, you liked him?
That's nice.

13
00:00:27,941 --> 00:00:31,276
Did you like when he changed the course of
American music like, two or three times?

14
00:00:31,361 --> 00:00:33,362
Did you like that
Tracks of My Tears

15
00:00:33,446 --> 00:00:35,948
is maybe the last true
love song ever written?

16
00:00:36,032 --> 00:00:37,449
I'm glad you
like him, Jim

17
00:00:37,534 --> 00:00:39,535
devastated right now

18
00:00:39,994 --> 00:00:42,496
Well, I second that emotion.
Huh?

19
00:00:42,789 --> 00:00:44,915
I know a few of his songs,
but what were his big ones?

20
00:00:44,999 --> 00:00:47,334
Oh, God, Nellie.
What wasn't his?

21
00:00:47,418 --> 00:00:49,294
Tracks of My Tears.

22
00:00:49,546 --> 00:00:50,796
Yeah

23
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:52,131
God, so many, Nellie

24
00:00:52,215 --> 00:00:53,632
No, no, no

25
00:00:53,716 --> 00:00:55,551
Tracks of My Tears
and what else?

26
00:00:55,635 --> 00:00:57,970
What are some more?
What's one more?

27
00:00:59,264 --> 00:01:02,391
Okay, I'm not I'm not playing
this game, Pam. Not today

28
00:01:02,767 --> 00:01:04,434
I don't think you love
Smokey Robinson.

29
00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:07,646
All of this to prove how
deep you are about music

30
00:01:07,730 --> 00:01:11,441
Okay, I'm sorry that I'm not a fan
of Jason Mraz or the Beatles.

31
00:01:11,526 --> 00:01:12,693
You don't like
the Beatles?

32
00:01:12,777 --> 00:01:13,986
That's not the point

33
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:15,863
Eleanor Rigby?
Paperback Writer?

34
00:01:15,947 --> 00:01:18,323
You always think you have time to
see these legends before they go.

35
00:01:18,408 --> 00:01:19,700
What was I so
busy doing?

36
00:01:19,826 --> 00:01:22,953
It says here the Smokey
Robinson dead thing is a hoax

37
00:01:23,037 --> 00:01:24,746
It's on CNN as of
two minutes ago.

38
00:01:26,624 --> 00:01:28,584
Okay, well
That's a relief

39
00:01:29,085 --> 00:01:30,127
Wow, look at that

40
00:01:30,211 --> 00:01:32,296
Says he's actually
playing State College

41
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:33,589
That's only three
hours away

42
00:01:34,299 --> 00:01:36,925
Oh, my God, Ryan
that's perfect.

43
00:01:37,010 --> 00:01:38,135
You have to go

44
00:01:38,219 --> 00:01:39,761
Tickets are
250 bucks.

45
00:01:40,138 --> 00:01:44,266
$250 is nothing to the world's
biggest Smokey Robinson fan

46
00:01:45,435 --> 00:01:46,560
Yeah

47
00:01:47,437 --> 00:01:49,646
Who's opening?
Paul Anka

48
00:01:49,731 --> 00:01:51,064
Paul Anka?

49
00:01:51,941 --> 00:01:54,693
How can they make the Smoke Man
play with someone like that?

50
00:01:56,613 --> 00:01:58,030
Okay, you could just
show up late, though

51
00:01:58,198 --> 00:01:59,531
How much is parking
like, 30 bucks?

52
00:01:59,616 --> 00:02:01,533
That's not what Smokey
would have wanted

53
00:02:01,618 --> 00:02:03,035
Does want

54
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:05,537
Tears of a Clown. Don't
call me a clown, Pam

55
00:02:05,622 --> 00:02:06,955
You're better than that

56
00:02:34,275 --> 00:02:35,400
Looking good, RC

57
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:38,820
I feel like I'm
being strangled

58
00:02:38,905 --> 00:02:43,408
like I'm at some erotic
asphyxiation sex club over on I-84.

59
00:02:43,493 --> 00:02:45,327
The Red Room, say
or Dominick's

60
00:02:45,453 --> 00:02:48,247
Robert, the Senator was going
to wear dark brown tonight.

61
00:02:50,416 --> 00:02:51,667
I'm sure it'll be fine

62
00:02:51,751 --> 00:02:55,921
My husband is sponsoring a fundraiser
tonight for local dog shelters

63
00:02:56,005 --> 00:02:59,132
Robert California bought
two tables for everyone here

64
00:02:59,217 --> 00:03:00,801
These people were
lucky to get seats

65
00:03:00,885 --> 00:03:04,721
because it is going to be a who's
who of the northern 22nd district

66
00:03:08,226 --> 00:03:11,061
but there is a distinct chance
that we're all about to be killed

67
00:03:11,145 --> 00:03:12,646
Well, as long as you don't
want to alarm people

68
00:03:12,814 --> 00:03:15,399
What's going on? There's a
disgruntled ex-employee

69
00:03:15,483 --> 00:03:17,234
sitting in his car
in the parking lot

70
00:03:17,318 --> 00:03:18,860
Oh, that's Andy.
He's just hanging out

71
00:03:19,028 --> 00:03:21,113
That's how workplace
tragedies always begin

72
00:03:21,197 --> 00:03:23,949
A middle-aged white
male "hanging out."

73
00:03:24,033 --> 00:03:25,075
Call the cops

74
00:03:25,159 --> 00:03:26,868
Dwight, I don't think he's
going to hurt anybody

75
00:03:26,953 --> 00:03:28,912
How do you know? I mean, why
do you think he's there?

76
00:03:29,038 --> 00:03:30,622
What kind of weapon he has

77
00:03:30,707 --> 00:03:32,374
Could be a knife
could be a gun.

78
00:03:32,458 --> 00:03:35,043
Could be a series of guns, all
lined up to shoot parallel

79
00:03:35,128 --> 00:03:36,586
I'm going up
to the roof.

80
00:03:36,671 --> 00:03:39,214
I'm going to bring my
gym bag just in case

81
00:03:41,884 --> 00:03:45,387
Everybody told me if I moved
to America I'd be murdered.

82
00:03:52,061 --> 00:03:53,645
Hey
Hey

83
00:03:53,730 --> 00:03:56,898
Just wanted to say hi and hear
you say everything's normal

84
00:03:56,983 --> 00:03:59,776
Maybe videotape you saying that so
that everyone upstairs can see?

85
00:04:00,903 --> 00:04:02,571
We think you
might kill Robert

86
00:04:02,655 --> 00:04:03,697
What?

87
00:04:03,781 --> 00:04:07,826
Because he fired you, which means
apparently you're living in your car now.

88
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:09,494
Guys, everything
is fine.

89
00:04:09,579 --> 00:04:11,955
I'm just here to pick up Erin.
We're going to the fundraiser

90
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:13,206
Great. That
sounds good

91
00:04:13,291 --> 00:04:14,333
Wait, what?

92
00:04:14,417 --> 00:04:16,335
You're going to the
fundraiser tonight?

93
00:04:16,419 --> 00:04:17,502
That's going to be weird

94
00:04:17,837 --> 00:04:19,046
Why would
that be weird?

95
00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:20,422
It's going to be
super weird.

96
00:04:20,506 --> 00:04:22,341
He just fired
you last week

97
00:04:22,759 --> 00:04:24,384
Andy's just coming
as my date

98
00:04:24,469 --> 00:04:26,845
Hey, I hear you I hope you're right

99
00:04:26,929 --> 00:04:30,932
It just seems like it's going
to be really, really weird

100
00:04:31,434 --> 00:04:33,560
Come in.

101
00:04:35,438 --> 00:04:37,147
You really redid
Andy's office, huh?

102
00:04:37,231 --> 00:04:38,857
Yes, cut out
the clutter.

103
00:04:38,941 --> 00:04:40,984
Very simple,
very minimal

104
00:04:41,402 --> 00:04:43,945
I need you to sign these.
We got a shipment going out

105
00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:46,406
How are things in
the warehouse?

106
00:04:46,491 --> 00:04:48,158
You could go downstairs
and ask them.

107
00:04:48,618 --> 00:04:50,952
The warehouse
isn't downstairs

108
00:04:52,705 --> 00:04:55,457
Is it?

109
00:04:55,875 --> 00:04:57,459
Who knew, right?

110
00:04:58,628 --> 00:04:59,628
L

111
00:05:01,005 --> 00:05:03,548
Tonight could be the
night that Darryl and I

112
00:05:03,633 --> 00:05:07,803
go from casual work friends
to actual good friends.

113
00:05:08,388 --> 00:05:13,475
The only thing standing in our way is
the contempt he seems to feel for me

114
00:05:16,687 --> 00:05:18,313
Robert, the Senator and
I wanted to stop by.

115
00:05:18,398 --> 00:05:19,856
Hello. Robert.
Robert, how are you?

116
00:05:19,941 --> 00:05:21,358
And say hello
- Hello.

117
00:05:21,442 --> 00:05:24,361
Did anyone order a blast from the
past with a side order of sexy?

118
00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:27,781
Hi, Andy
Oh, man, this is weird

119
00:05:27,865 --> 00:05:29,074
Andrew
Oh

120
00:05:29,659 --> 00:05:31,785
Want to shake
my hand, huh?

121
00:05:32,703 --> 00:05:35,122
Because I want to
shake your body

122
00:05:39,252 --> 00:05:40,794
Where.
Where do I look?

123
00:05:40,878 --> 00:05:43,713
It's been so long since I
did one of these things

124
00:05:43,798 --> 00:05:45,173
Okay, all right

125
00:05:45,258 --> 00:05:47,801
What's the question?
How am I doing? Umm

126
00:05:48,594 --> 00:05:49,845
Great

127
00:05:52,723 --> 00:05:54,266
So, how's the talent?

128
00:05:54,684 --> 00:05:57,018
Grey suit over there
is sending a signal.

129
00:05:57,103 --> 00:05:59,187
Downstairs is receiving

130
00:06:01,899 --> 00:06:02,899
Is that Gabe?

131
00:06:03,526 --> 00:06:04,568
Ladies

132
00:06:06,028 --> 00:06:07,946
How come you look so
decent all of a sudden?

133
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:09,489
Yeah, normally you
look so stricken

134
00:06:10,616 --> 00:06:11,783
Well, I'm embarrassed

135
00:06:11,868 --> 00:06:13,743
I had to give up
my hair gel

136
00:06:13,828 --> 00:06:16,079
because it was giving me
this angry rash on my scalp

137
00:06:16,414 --> 00:06:18,665
And I just gave up
on this low-protein diet

138
00:06:18,749 --> 00:06:21,042
that I was doing
for eight years, so

139
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:25,297
Ladies seem to like it, plus I'm getting,
like, half as many bladder infections

140
00:06:25,715 --> 00:06:27,090
Wow
Yeah.

141
00:06:27,091 --> 00:06:29,342
Wow You ladies look
very pretty as well

142
00:06:29,886 --> 00:06:32,137
Thanks
Why is it that things are

143
00:06:32,221 --> 00:06:34,389
their most beautiful
in the autumn of their lives?

144
00:06:37,268 --> 00:06:38,435
You had to say that

145
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:40,604
Sorry. Sorry.
Thanks

146
00:06:40,688 --> 00:06:41,730
Yeah

147
00:06:41,898 --> 00:06:45,984
Creed, I just bid $20
on six jujitsu lessons

148
00:06:46,402 --> 00:06:48,153
No one's
raping this guy

149
00:06:48,237 --> 00:06:49,821
Well, I don't
want to get raped

150
00:06:51,032 --> 00:06:53,074
No, it was my idea to
not be raped Oh, well.

151
00:06:53,159 --> 00:06:56,161
Wait, you think that
jujitsu classes cost $22?

152
00:06:56,245 --> 00:06:57,496
If you're going to
play guess the price

153
00:06:57,580 --> 00:06:59,331
you might as well try
and be halfway accurate

154
00:06:59,415 --> 00:07:00,874
$180

155
00:07:00,958 --> 00:07:02,209
Whoa

156
00:07:02,293 --> 00:07:03,627
Dwight, I don't think
you understand.

157
00:07:03,711 --> 00:07:05,837
You guess the price
you win the prize

158
00:07:05,922 --> 00:07:08,840
Have you never been
to a Quaker fair before?

159
00:07:10,176 --> 00:07:11,259
God

160
00:07:12,011 --> 00:07:15,472
So, Dwight doesn't
understand silent auctions.

161
00:07:17,099 --> 00:07:20,227
Guy in the office. Huh?

162
00:07:21,437 --> 00:07:24,189
Because up until now
we didn't have one

163
00:07:24,732 --> 00:07:25,774
What haven't I been doing?

164
00:07:26,108 --> 00:07:28,652
Gosh, just today I was working on
this rock opera that I'm writing

165
00:07:28,736 --> 00:07:31,279
although it feels more like I'm
receiving it than writing it

166
00:07:31,656 --> 00:07:33,698
Wow, that's
exciting

167
00:07:34,242 --> 00:07:36,826
But until you firm up the idea, you
might want to keep it between us

168
00:07:36,911 --> 00:07:39,496
The hero lives in
this dystopian future

169
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:43,667
and he flies around in a spaceship
that's shaped like a treble clef.

170
00:07:44,168 --> 00:07:46,503
And he has to sing his heart
out to destroy all evil

171
00:07:47,129 --> 00:07:48,296
Sounds like you're
doing all right.

172
00:07:48,422 --> 00:07:50,674
A little better than
all right, actually.

173
00:07:51,676 --> 00:07:52,884
Really good

174
00:07:53,135 --> 00:07:54,594
Have you thought about
getting into photography?

175
00:07:54,845 --> 00:07:56,930
Are you kidding me?
'Cause I'm way into it

176
00:07:57,014 --> 00:07:58,723
What are you
taking pictures of?

177
00:07:58,808 --> 00:07:59,849
Children?
Yes

178
00:07:59,934 --> 00:08:01,059
Homeless people?
Yes

179
00:08:01,143 --> 00:08:02,727
'Cause in a way
they're more real

180
00:08:02,812 --> 00:08:04,563
than the rest of us!
The rest of us

181
00:08:05,064 --> 00:08:07,107
This guy's
having a breakdown

182
00:08:07,275 --> 00:08:10,652
You know, Oscar, I really had no idea that
you were so passionate about animals.

183
00:08:10,778 --> 00:08:12,445
My dog, Gerald is my life.
Really?

184
00:08:12,530 --> 00:08:14,281
Well, if you want to
get involved, call me

185
00:08:14,991 --> 00:08:16,283
This is my cell

186
00:08:16,993 --> 00:08:20,370
I'm more likely to
pick up at night, say

187
00:08:21,956 --> 00:08:23,331
after 9:00

188
00:08:24,959 --> 00:08:26,293
Excuse me

189
00:08:26,877 --> 00:08:28,086
This confirms three things

190
00:08:28,170 --> 00:08:32,215
I'm right about the Senator, I
still got it and poor Angela.

191
00:08:33,342 --> 00:08:34,968
Got the flowers.

192
00:08:35,344 --> 00:08:37,053
That piece is
so predictable

193
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:39,598
Daffodils in spring I wonder what's next

194
00:08:39,682 --> 00:08:40,682
mistletoe at Christmas?

195
00:08:41,684 --> 00:08:42,684
Yeah

196
00:08:42,768 --> 00:08:45,061
Oh! It says, "You're welcome
to take this home.'

197
00:08:45,813 --> 00:08:46,813
Oh

198
00:08:47,356 --> 00:08:50,650
Sweetie, you don't want that Even
in your house, it's a little much.

199
00:08:52,194 --> 00:08:53,194
Have you ever been
to our house?

200
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:55,363
Not exactly,
but I know the Flats

201
00:08:57,283 --> 00:08:59,409
I'm going to say what
everyone is afraid to say

202
00:09:00,328 --> 00:09:01,578
Phyllis is a bully

203
00:09:02,246 --> 00:09:04,706
A big, beautiful bully

204
00:09:05,458 --> 00:09:07,417
And she is not
getting that centerpiece

205
00:09:08,502 --> 00:09:10,587
Step in right
away and start

206
00:09:10,671 --> 00:09:12,255
Bobby, Bobbo

207
00:09:12,757 --> 00:09:13,965
You're a rock
opera guy, right?

208
00:09:14,050 --> 00:09:15,592
You like rock operas
Well

209
00:09:15,676 --> 00:09:17,135
You've got to check out
this thing I'm working on

210
00:09:17,219 --> 00:09:18,219
It's really cool

211
00:09:18,304 --> 00:09:19,929
There's this character
Thomas Oregon

212
00:09:20,014 --> 00:09:22,974
and he wants to destroy all
the guitars in the world

213
00:09:23,059 --> 00:09:28,229
because he realizes that music is
the one thing he can't control

214
00:09:29,565 --> 00:09:32,025
So, Thomas Oregon
is an evil figure

215
00:09:32,109 --> 00:09:33,318
Evil

216
00:09:34,487 --> 00:09:36,196
Although he's
humanized at the end

217
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:39,616
because he weeps uncontrollably
and pees in his pants.

218
00:09:40,242 --> 00:09:42,202
And the hero
who is that based on?

219
00:09:42,578 --> 00:09:44,120
Me, I guess

220
00:09:45,206 --> 00:09:48,333
We're flying so high
we're cracking the sky

221
00:09:48,626 --> 00:09:52,671
Going to fly out of this
dome My girlfriend and I

222
00:09:55,424 --> 00:09:57,759
Hey, jabroni,
show some class

223
00:09:58,177 --> 00:10:00,011
She's right, Andy
You're being a jabroni

224
00:10:00,096 --> 00:10:01,513
You're being a
Thomas Oregon

225
00:10:02,348 --> 00:10:03,682
Andrew

226
00:10:05,434 --> 00:10:07,852
I think this may have
been a bad idea.

227
00:10:08,562 --> 00:10:11,022
Why don't you let me
pay for you and Erin

228
00:10:11,107 --> 00:10:14,025
to go out to a great
romantic dinner tonight?

229
00:10:14,110 --> 00:10:16,778
Don't need you to pay for me.
I'm doing just fine, thank you.

230
00:10:16,862 --> 00:10:19,656
Why don't you quit
harshing our mellow?

231
00:10:20,241 --> 00:10:22,325
Andy, you should leave

232
00:10:22,410 --> 00:10:23,451
Now

233
00:10:25,413 --> 00:10:26,705
Excuse me

234
00:10:26,789 --> 00:10:30,291
I would like to purchase two
seats at another table, please.

235
00:10:30,376 --> 00:10:32,377
I'm sorry. The tables are
sold as complete units.

236
00:10:32,795 --> 00:10:34,713
Then I'll take a table

237
00:10:34,797 --> 00:10:35,797
Okay

238
00:10:35,881 --> 00:10:37,465
And a high five

239
00:10:38,634 --> 00:10:40,427
Let's do that again

240
00:10:43,139 --> 00:10:45,473
Well, I just give a
dollar to every charity

241
00:10:45,558 --> 00:10:47,350
That way, you get all the
mail, all the calendars.

242
00:10:47,435 --> 00:10:49,811
You can't believe how much
you get just for a buck

243
00:10:50,479 --> 00:10:52,772
It's also nice to know
you're making a difference

244
00:10:53,274 --> 00:10:54,858
Jim and I give
to the Red Cross

245
00:10:55,151 --> 00:10:56,943
Are you sure you
ought to be giving?

246
00:10:57,027 --> 00:10:59,237
I mean, with your
financial situation

247
00:10:59,655 --> 00:11:00,822
Excuse me?

248
00:11:02,158 --> 00:11:06,411
You ladies are as tangy as the salad
dressing over there. I love it.

249
00:11:07,204 --> 00:11:08,955
Oh, yes indeed

250
00:11:10,166 --> 00:11:11,249
When

251
00:11:12,668 --> 00:11:14,794
Whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa

252
00:11:14,879 --> 00:11:16,671
Forgot a few salads

253
00:11:21,510 --> 00:11:28,933
When

254
00:11:29,769 --> 00:11:33,855
I stumbled into a
very dramatic situation

255
00:11:34,190 --> 00:11:36,524
Here, let me move this
so you can see him.

256
00:11:37,610 --> 00:11:38,610
Pam

257
00:11:40,029 --> 00:11:41,488
Pam.
Yeah

258
00:11:41,864 --> 00:11:43,698
Angela's husband
just hit on me.

259
00:11:44,950 --> 00:11:46,534
Oh, my God I know.

260
00:11:46,619 --> 00:11:47,744
Wait, what? Come on

261
00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:50,121
We were talking
about animals

262
00:11:51,248 --> 00:11:52,916
He gives me his
cell phone number

263
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,292
He was just dying
for me to have it.

264
00:11:54,376 --> 00:11:57,712
Okay, Oscar, I'm not saying
you're not dreamy because you are

265
00:11:57,797 --> 00:12:00,590
but isn't it possible that he
was just schmoozing a voter?

266
00:12:01,050 --> 00:12:03,510
Well, if you would have
seen the look he gave me

267
00:12:03,594 --> 00:12:05,220
He wanted to rock
more than just my vote

268
00:12:05,304 --> 00:12:06,387
Okay

269
00:12:06,472 --> 00:12:07,680
What was this look?

270
00:12:10,476 --> 00:12:11,518
Whoa

271
00:12:11,644 --> 00:12:13,311
What happened? Did he do it?
Are you

272
00:12:13,395 --> 00:12:15,230
Twice. For real?

273
00:12:15,314 --> 00:12:17,649
Okay, guys. Not every glance
means something, all right?

274
00:12:17,733 --> 00:12:18,733
Life isn't Downton Abbey.

275
00:12:18,818 --> 00:12:20,109
Life is Downton Abbey.

276
00:12:20,194 --> 00:12:21,194
Here's what
I'm going to do

277
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:22,695
I'm going to go over there
I'm going to talk to him

278
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:24,781
And I guarantee you he gives out
his cell phone to everybody

279
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:38,211
How much do you guys charge for
one full-year gym membership?

280
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:41,172
Thank you

281
00:12:44,093 --> 00:12:45,677
It's $475

282
00:12:47,429 --> 00:12:49,347
Like candy from a baby

283
00:12:54,770 --> 00:12:57,188
That's the third time you've
asked me about my strategy

284
00:12:57,273 --> 00:12:59,983
It's called "Guess the Price, '
strategy's in the name.

285
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:02,861
Simplest game since
"Touch the Rock."

286
00:13:03,904 --> 00:13:05,321
Three-time champion

287
00:13:05,406 --> 00:13:07,866
Almost four, but
I touched the wood

288
00:13:10,953 --> 00:13:11,995
Hey

289
00:13:13,914 --> 00:13:15,707
David Wallace?
Andy Bernard?

290
00:13:15,833 --> 00:13:17,667
Hey, how are you? How you doing?
I'm great.

291
00:13:17,751 --> 00:13:19,377
How are you doing? Are you
still with Dunder Mifflin?

292
00:13:19,503 --> 00:13:21,045
No, got canned last week

293
00:13:21,755 --> 00:13:22,839
Oh. I'm sorry
to hear that.

294
00:13:22,923 --> 00:13:24,382
No, best thing that
ever happened to me

295
00:13:24,466 --> 00:13:25,592
That's the attitude
to have.

296
00:13:25,676 --> 00:13:28,219
You know what? When I got
canned I was lost, right?

297
00:13:28,304 --> 00:13:32,140
I poured myself into this ridiculous
vacuum for toys called Suck It.

298
00:13:32,516 --> 00:13:34,434
Yikes.
Yeah, exactly, right?

299
00:13:34,518 --> 00:13:35,560
Then suddenly
out of nowhere

300
00:13:35,644 --> 00:13:39,147
the US Military bought the
patent from me for $20 million

301
00:13:40,190 --> 00:13:41,900
Point is,
forget those guys

302
00:13:41,984 --> 00:13:43,026
Okay? Move on

303
00:13:44,194 --> 00:13:45,570
Good to see you, Andy

304
00:13:50,701 --> 00:13:54,495
Call me a lay man, but I wish
there was some real food here

305
00:13:54,872 --> 00:13:56,915
You know
like hamburgers

306
00:13:58,459 --> 00:14:01,920
or Oreos,
or a pizza pie, or

307
00:14:02,838 --> 00:14:05,673
What's another food that we like?
Tacos

308
00:14:05,758 --> 00:14:10,720
What I wouldn't give
for a big mess of tacos

309
00:14:10,804 --> 00:14:12,055
Tacos.
Right now

310
00:14:12,139 --> 00:14:13,765
some tacos.

311
00:14:13,849 --> 00:14:14,933
Brilliant

312
00:14:15,351 --> 00:14:16,476
If you loan me
some money

313
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,311
Yes, I can do that

314
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:23,858
For two tacos we
probably need about

315
00:14:24,652 --> 00:14:28,404
what, $20?
Or $25? 20

316
00:14:28,530 --> 00:14:29,781
30.
$30

317
00:14:29,865 --> 00:14:31,574
Yes, yes

318
00:14:32,201 --> 00:14:33,660
I've never eaten a taco

319
00:14:33,744 --> 00:14:35,787
I'm not entirely sure
what they are.

320
00:14:35,871 --> 00:14:40,208
As long as they're not slimy, and
please, God, don't let them have eyes

321
00:14:44,755 --> 00:14:46,005
So?
Boom

322
00:14:48,759 --> 00:14:49,884
This is interesting

323
00:14:50,970 --> 00:14:52,261
Mm-hmm
What is interesting?

324
00:14:52,346 --> 00:14:54,305
He gives his cell
out to everybody

325
00:14:55,349 --> 00:14:57,517
Or you proved that
he thinks you're gay

326
00:14:57,601 --> 00:14:58,977
He doesn't think
Jim is gay.

327
00:14:59,061 --> 00:15:00,728
A gay man would not leave the
house wearing those shoes

328
00:15:00,854 --> 00:15:03,106
A gay man wouldn't leave the
store wearing those shoes

329
00:15:03,399 --> 00:15:05,400
Hey, you bought
me these shoes.

330
00:15:06,443 --> 00:15:07,777
Wait a second
where's the centerpiece?

331
00:15:07,903 --> 00:15:10,071
So I threw it in the garbage.

332
00:15:10,572 --> 00:15:12,991
Really, Phyllis? You didn't
just put it in your car?

333
00:15:13,075 --> 00:15:14,075
Nope

334
00:15:14,535 --> 00:15:16,202
Which garbage?
It's not there anymore.

335
00:15:16,286 --> 00:15:18,663
A man emptied the garbage
into a bigger garbage

336
00:15:18,747 --> 00:15:20,999
and then I heard someone say
they were locking the garbage

337
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:22,875
You are out
of control, Phyllis

338
00:15:23,585 --> 00:15:26,421
Come on, sweetie. We both
knew how this was gonna end

339
00:15:30,217 --> 00:15:32,593
Before we bring out
our guest of honor tonight,

340
00:15:32,678 --> 00:15:37,849
we are very proud to introduce a great
philanthropist, and a great guy,

341
00:15:38,183 --> 00:15:39,851
Robert California.

342
00:15:45,774 --> 00:15:46,899
Thank you.

343
00:15:46,984 --> 00:15:49,068
Why do we love dogs?

344
00:15:49,862 --> 00:15:51,696
Want me to tell you why?

345
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:53,406
There is no answer.

346
00:15:53,490 --> 00:15:56,993
Our love for them
confounds reason.

347
00:15:57,703 --> 00:15:58,995
Do you believe this guy?

348
00:15:59,079 --> 00:16:01,956
The State Senator Robert
Lip\ton loves dogs.

349
00:16:02,458 --> 00:16:04,792
He asked me if I loved dogs.

350
00:16:05,753 --> 00:16:07,378
You know what I said?

351
00:16:07,463 --> 00:16:08,504
Yes.

352
00:16:10,007 --> 00:16:12,508
Not a joke. That,
that was not even a joke

353
00:16:12,593 --> 00:16:16,012
Bella here was a
therapy dog for 10 years.

354
00:16:16,096 --> 00:16:20,725
When her owner passed away, she came
to this organization for placement.

355
00:16:20,809 --> 00:16:24,312
But people don't often
adopt older dogs.

356
00:16:24,688 --> 00:16:29,233
So Bella and 11
heroes like her

357
00:16:29,985 --> 00:16:33,738
are being cared for by
our generous volunteers

358
00:16:33,822 --> 00:16:35,865
because, frankly,
nobody else will.

359
00:16:39,286 --> 00:16:42,163
Of those dogs

360
00:16:42,539 --> 00:16:43,998
Andy, that's very
kind, but...

361
00:16:44,083 --> 00:16:48,086
No, no, no This guy can
talk and talk all he wants

362
00:16:48,170 --> 00:16:49,879
but it's not that
complicated.

363
00:16:50,005 --> 00:16:52,507
Andy, why don't we discuss this...
No, no, no. It's about

364
00:16:52,591 --> 00:16:57,053
being there for someone after it's become
inconvenient for them to be around

365
00:16:57,387 --> 00:16:59,180
Hello, everyone.
I'm Andy Bernard

366
00:16:59,264 --> 00:17:03,184
and I am going to take
that bitch home.

367
00:17:05,354 --> 00:17:07,647
That is a female
dog reference.

368
00:17:08,357 --> 00:17:10,566
This bitch
understands loyalty

369
00:17:10,651 --> 00:17:12,110
Sassy human reference

370
00:17:12,194 --> 00:17:14,695
Thank you.
I will take Bella

371
00:17:15,114 --> 00:17:16,114
Aw

372
00:17:16,406 --> 00:17:18,491
And every single
one of her friends

373
00:17:18,575 --> 00:17:19,826
Oh, God

374
00:17:22,704 --> 00:17:23,955
This way

375
00:17:24,039 --> 00:17:26,082
Hope you all learned
something Okay.

376
00:17:28,502 --> 00:17:31,295
Huey's going to need his
medication once every 90 minutes.

377
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:33,256
You can administer it orally,
but he's going to puke it up

378
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:34,757
So other end's best

379
00:17:35,008 --> 00:17:38,261
Don't split up Daisy and Mojo
because Daisy will start to...

380
00:17:38,345 --> 00:17:40,972
I was going to say bark
but it's more of a scream

381
00:17:41,098 --> 00:17:43,933
I'm so ready to love
all of these animals

382
00:17:44,226 --> 00:17:46,602
This one's even bonding
with me already.

383
00:17:46,687 --> 00:17:48,437
A therapy dog.

384
00:17:48,522 --> 00:17:50,898
He apparently thinks you're in
some kind of emotional crisis.

385
00:17:53,318 --> 00:17:54,694
Stupid dog

386
00:17:55,070 --> 00:17:58,573
If you would like to talk about this
some more, my door is always open

387
00:17:58,657 --> 00:18:01,242
So here's my office number
and my cell number.

388
00:18:01,326 --> 00:18:02,952
Thank you.
Okay

389
00:18:03,745 --> 00:18:05,288
Well, it looks like he
really did just want

390
00:18:05,372 --> 00:18:07,081
to talk about the issues
I'm sorry, Oscar

391
00:18:07,207 --> 00:18:10,334
No, sorry about what? There's
nothing to be sorry about here.

392
00:18:10,794 --> 00:18:15,214
No, I'm certainly not disappointed that
Angela's husband wasn't hitting on me

393
00:18:15,299 --> 00:18:17,925
I'd have to be a
monster to root for that

394
00:18:18,010 --> 00:18:20,094
A lonely, aging monster

395
00:18:21,763 --> 00:18:23,264
Tacos were on sale

396
00:18:23,432 --> 00:18:24,932
Eight for $3

397
00:18:26,268 --> 00:18:27,768
Oh, great

398
00:18:29,104 --> 00:18:30,188
Okay

399
00:18:30,272 --> 00:18:32,732
Oh. Oh. Oh

400
00:18:32,816 --> 00:18:34,317
These tacos

401
00:18:34,443 --> 00:18:35,943
Mm-hmm
Mmm

402
00:18:37,446 --> 00:18:45,786
Uh.

403
00:18:46,038 --> 00:18:47,038
Mmm

404
00:18:47,372 --> 00:18:49,498
Mmm. Oh

405
00:18:50,417 --> 00:18:51,459
Huh

406
00:18:52,461 --> 00:18:53,461
Mmm

407
00:18:54,671 --> 00:18:56,714
Well, that's hit the spot

408
00:18:56,924 --> 00:18:57,965
Um

409
00:18:58,467 --> 00:18:59,508
Very savory

410
00:19:00,594 --> 00:19:02,553
What do you do with
the crispy holder?

411
00:19:02,638 --> 00:19:04,597
Here, let's try this again

412
00:19:04,848 --> 00:19:06,224
Here, don't put
your finger in

413
00:19:06,308 --> 00:19:07,934
Yeah, just hold it like that.
Hold it to the side

414
00:19:08,018 --> 00:19:09,936
Right
Hold it to the side

415
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:12,146
Lean it to the side.
Look at me, like this

416
00:19:12,981 --> 00:19:14,482
She's trying

417
00:19:15,234 --> 00:19:18,819
The winner of the three-day
trip to the Skytop Lodge

418
00:19:18,904 --> 00:19:20,905
is Dwight Schrute!

419
00:19:20,989 --> 00:19:22,031
Yes

420
00:19:26,078 --> 00:19:30,289
The year-long membership to
Scranton Bikram Yoga is...

421
00:19:30,832 --> 00:19:31,916
Dwight Schrute!

422
00:19:32,042 --> 00:19:33,334
Oh, yes

423
00:19:34,169 --> 00:19:35,294
Yeah

424
00:19:36,505 --> 00:19:42,718
A one hour appointment with the "Kissing
Magician" goes to Dwight Schrute.

425
00:19:42,803 --> 00:19:45,805
Oh, yeah

426
00:19:46,848 --> 00:19:50,184
Well, I think I can save
us all some time.

427
00:19:50,727 --> 00:19:54,021
Dwight Schrute has
won every single item here.

428
00:19:54,106 --> 00:19:55,564
Thank you very much

429
00:19:55,649 --> 00:19:59,360
All I had to do was look up
the prices, idiots. Suck it

430
00:19:59,444 --> 00:20:03,406
Well, Dwight, yes, you certainly
are a record breaker.

431
00:20:03,949 --> 00:20:07,201
Your donation is the largest
we've ever received

432
00:20:07,286 --> 00:20:10,913
at over $34,000.

433
00:20:17,462 --> 00:20:20,756
Speech

434
00:20:20,841 --> 00:20:22,883
Come on. Speech, speech

435
00:20:36,231 --> 00:20:37,565
Thank you.

436
00:20:39,318 --> 00:20:41,235
Wow, I can't tell you

437
00:20:43,155 --> 00:20:45,948
what an honor it is
to support this

438
00:20:47,617 --> 00:20:48,743
thing.

439
00:20:49,244 --> 00:20:53,372
And obviously that amount of money
is no concern to me whatsoever.

440
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:58,627
But I want to ask
you something.

441
00:20:58,754 --> 00:21:02,923
When did it become
all about the money?

442
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:07,762
When did it become about
the flower arrangements?

443
00:21:08,263 --> 00:21:10,222
And the white
wine spritzers?

444
00:21:10,307 --> 00:21:11,349
Hmm?

445
00:21:11,433 --> 00:21:13,559
And all the dinner rolls?

446
00:21:13,643 --> 00:21:15,519
You people should be
ashamed of yourselves.

447
00:21:15,604 --> 00:21:18,105
How many courses did
we have tonight?

448
00:21:18,190 --> 00:21:20,441
Two? Three, maybe?

449
00:21:21,068 --> 00:21:22,651
If you chose the pudding.

450
00:21:22,736 --> 00:21:27,948
These tables tarted up
like Victorian whores.

451
00:21:28,033 --> 00:21:30,284
Let's remember we are all here

452
00:21:32,704 --> 00:21:34,372
for the dog society.

453
00:21:34,456 --> 00:21:37,458
He's what's important,
whatever his name is.

454
00:21:37,876 --> 00:21:39,543
Not any of this.

455
00:21:39,628 --> 00:21:43,714
So that is going to be
my donation to you.

456
00:21:43,799 --> 00:21:45,466
Thank you and good night.

457
00:21:45,550 --> 00:21:46,550
Whoa

458
00:21:47,469 --> 00:21:48,469
Uh

459
00:21:53,350 --> 00:21:55,518
Oscar. Nice to
see you again

460
00:21:55,602 --> 00:21:57,395
It was lovely
It was lovely

461
00:21:57,479 --> 00:21:59,814
And don't forget to call. Okay

462
00:22:02,943 --> 00:22:04,985
Thanks so
much for coming

463
00:22:05,070 --> 00:22:07,488
Why does this always
happen to me? Ahh!

464
00:22:08,698 --> 00:22:10,950
I just feel so
bad for Angela

465
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:15,162
Apparently, there were some silly
rumors going around tonight

466
00:22:15,997 --> 00:22:17,665
We are very much in love

467
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:21,001
Very much in love

468
00:22:22,462 --> 00:22:25,172
So it just goes on under
here like this?

469
00:22:25,257 --> 00:22:26,674
That's right

470
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:28,926
Oh, God. Yeah, you never
get used to that.

471
00:22:29,010 --> 00:22:31,554
Hey, just wanted to check in
to see how you're doing.

472
00:22:33,348 --> 00:22:35,558
He's great.
We're all great

473
00:22:35,684 --> 00:22:36,934
Twelve dogs

474
00:22:37,018 --> 00:22:39,770
This is my life now
I'm a dog nurse

475
00:22:39,855 --> 00:22:41,772
Look at that one,
though. He's smiling

476
00:22:41,857 --> 00:22:44,316
Yeah, he should be It's his
first day without a muzzle

477
00:22:45,152 --> 00:22:48,487
This is the greatest thing
that has ever happened to me.

478
00:22:48,572 --> 00:22:50,406
Absolutely, it's
Yes

479
00:22:50,490 --> 00:22:51,574
Awesome.
I'm sorry

480
00:22:51,658 --> 00:22:53,033
Are you guys nuts?

481
00:22:53,535 --> 00:22:54,577
He's not doing great

482
00:22:54,703 --> 00:22:56,036
He was fired

483
00:22:56,121 --> 00:22:57,329
This is terrible

484
00:22:57,831 --> 00:23:01,125
This is literally the worst thing
that has ever happened to you

485
00:23:01,209 --> 00:23:02,376
Not the best

486
00:23:08,550 --> 00:23:10,050
You're right

487
00:23:10,385 --> 00:23:11,886
He's right. I am a mess

488
00:23:12,137 --> 00:23:14,430
This whole night I've been trying
to convince you guys that I'm fine.

489
00:23:14,514 --> 00:23:18,893
I guess I thought that if I could
convince you that I'm fine, maybe

490
00:23:18,977 --> 00:23:20,603
Maybe you would
think it, too.

491
00:23:24,524 --> 00:23:27,526
I'm sorry,
it's just, I

492
00:23:28,403 --> 00:23:31,447
in a lot of human
conversations, so

493
00:23:31,573 --> 00:23:34,825
Okay. Well, Andy, listen it's okay
if you don't feel totally settled.

494
00:23:34,910 --> 00:23:36,243
This is all very fresh

495
00:23:36,328 --> 00:23:38,579
Yeah, I mean, admitting that you
need help is the first step.

496
00:23:38,663 --> 00:23:42,082
Yes, and also focusing
on the positive.

497
00:23:42,751 --> 00:23:44,585
Like, I got a lot of good
things going on.

498
00:23:44,669 --> 00:23:47,171
Yeah, like that
rock opera.

499
00:23:47,255 --> 00:23:48,631
You could always
do that, right?

500
00:23:48,715 --> 00:23:50,382
Yeah, I do. I have that

501
00:23:51,593 --> 00:23:52,551
Yeah

502
00:23:52,636 --> 00:23:53,761
You're going
to be all right

503
00:23:53,845 --> 00:23:55,721
No. No, he's not

504
00:23:56,389 --> 00:23:57,515
Yes, I am

505
00:23:57,599 --> 00:23:59,725
Thank you, Kev
You're welcome

506
00:24:00,602 --> 00:24:04,104
Sometimes I feel like everyone
I work with is an idiot.

507
00:24:04,439 --> 00:24:07,399
And by sometimes
I mean all times.

508
00:24:08,276 --> 00:24:09,735
All the times

509
00:24:10,946 --> 00:24:12,613
Every of the time

510
00:24:15,408 --> 00:24:17,826
So, some of us ended up
adopting those elderly dogs

511
00:24:17,911 --> 00:24:18,911
It's been great

512
00:24:18,995 --> 00:24:21,872
Pepper's been getting me out
of the house Going on runs

513
00:24:21,957 --> 00:24:24,458
My dog Ruby
doesn't do anything

514
00:24:24,543 --> 00:24:26,377
She just lays
there all day

515
00:24:26,461 --> 00:24:27,962
She's so chill

516
00:24:28,255 --> 00:24:29,547
What do you
feed her?

517
00:24:29,631 --> 00:24:32,716
Well, I put out Pro Bow Wow
but she barely touches it

518
00:24:32,801 --> 00:24:34,176
She's so dainty

519
00:24:34,553 --> 00:24:35,553
Is she sick?

520
00:24:35,637 --> 00:24:37,096
How are her poops?

521
00:24:37,180 --> 00:24:38,347
Doesn't really poop

522
00:24:38,431 --> 00:24:39,974
It's perfect

523
00:24:40,058 --> 00:24:41,392
Nothing to pick up

524
00:24:41,476 --> 00:24:44,144
She just kind of lies there
all day like a good girl.

525
00:24:46,314 --> 00:24:49,608
But I have to prop her eyes
open so she can see it.

526
00:24:49,818 --> 00:24:50,859
Does she smell?

527
00:24:50,944 --> 00:24:52,486
She smells horrible

528
00:24:52,571 --> 00:24:53,821
It's unbelievable

529
00:24:53,905 --> 00:24:56,073
But I don't want to
put her in the bath

530
00:24:56,157 --> 00:24:58,367
'Cause I'm afraid
that she'll drown

531
00:25:00,453 --> 00:25:03,289
People seem awful
interested in you, Ruby

532
00:25:03,873 --> 00:25:06,417
Guess they're
just jealous, right?

533
00:25:06,501 --> 00:25:08,335
Yeah, that a girl

534
00:25:08,420 --> 00:25:09,837
That a girl

535
00:25:09,921 --> 00:25:11,171
Man, that stinks
