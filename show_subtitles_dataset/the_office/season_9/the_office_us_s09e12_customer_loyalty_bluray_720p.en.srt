1
00:00:01,690 --> 00:00:03,579
We've got to clear out
this cabinet, people.

2
00:00:03,650 --> 00:00:05,891
A lot of these
are dead accounts.

3
00:00:06,170 --> 00:00:07,660
Scranton Mimeograph Corp?

4
00:00:07,730 --> 00:00:09,653
I don't think we're doing
business with them any time soon.

5
00:00:10,330 --> 00:00:11,741
That's odd.

6
00:00:12,650 --> 00:00:14,493
A letter from Robert Dunder.

7
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:16,973
"A valuable artifact has come
into my possession.

8
00:00:17,290 --> 00:00:19,736
"I have hidden it
until such time as a person

9
00:00:19,810 --> 00:00:22,654
"of strong intellect
may safely recover it.

10
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:24,894
"This golden chalice
is of immeasurable

11
00:00:25,010 --> 00:00:27,012
"historical and
religious significance."

12
00:00:30,010 --> 00:00:31,136
The Holy Grail.

13
00:00:31,450 --> 00:00:33,691
Did you send Dwight on a
quest for the Holy Grail?

14
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:37,413
I think I'm a little too
busy these days to send...

15
00:00:37,810 --> 00:00:42,179
Oh, my God, I did send Dwight on a
quest for the Holy Grail.

16
00:00:42,490 --> 00:00:44,254
The Dunder Code!

17
00:00:44,530 --> 00:00:46,897
I completely forgot
about that prank.

18
00:00:47,170 --> 00:00:49,571
That had to be, like,
six or seven years ago.

19
00:00:49,930 --> 00:00:51,455
Stayed late every
night for a month.

20
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:53,819
Had a lot more
free time back then.

21
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:55,938
I don't get it.
Ah-ha!

22
00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:57,535
A light bulb.

23
00:00:58,210 --> 00:00:59,575
A light bulb?
A light bulb!

24
00:00:59,930 --> 00:01:01,739
Okay, Okay-

25
00:01:03,170 --> 00:01:04,535
Invisible ink.

26
00:01:05,050 --> 00:01:06,415
Whoa.

27
00:01:09,370 --> 00:01:11,213
- The ceiling above accounting!
- Dwight!

28
00:01:11,650 --> 00:01:13,061
Down, Dwight! Dwight!

29
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:16,575
Man, I wish I was there to see
his face when he gets to the end

30
00:01:16,730 --> 00:01:19,495
and finds the fake grail?

31
00:01:21,010 --> 00:01:22,853
No grail?
You don't remember?

32
00:01:22,930 --> 00:01:23,977
I don't.

33
00:01:24,890 --> 00:01:26,016
An X?

34
00:01:26,290 --> 00:01:28,975
Annex. It must open
something in the annex.

35
00:01:29,770 --> 00:01:31,499
Oh.
Oh.

36
00:01:36,650 --> 00:01:38,971
"Seat of entrance."

37
00:01:45,410 --> 00:01:46,457
What?

38
00:01:46,730 --> 00:01:48,095
That's a flush.

39
00:01:52,010 --> 00:01:53,250
The warehouse!

40
00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:01,580
- There's nothing down here.
- Oh.

41
00:02:01,930 --> 00:02:03,819
I expected more
from Young Halpert.

42
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:07,299
This just...
Forget it, forget it.

43
00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:26,853
So, how are we getting on with our
grand social media initiative?

44
00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:29,331
Well, we created
a fake profile

45
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:32,897
for a really cool guy
named Derek McBlack. Wow.

46
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:36,299
It's just Pete in sunglasses.
Oh.

47
00:02:36,370 --> 00:02:38,259
And then we had him
like Dunder Mifflin.

48
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:40,941
Then we created a bunch
of fake friends for Derek,

49
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:43,661
and we had all of them
like Derek's likes.

50
00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:46,051
So far we're only popular
with imaginary people,

51
00:02:46,130 --> 00:02:48,736
but we think this is the
start of something big.

52
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:49,971
You two are geniuses.

53
00:02:50,330 --> 00:02:53,061
And I am a genius for
putting you two together.

54
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:54,291
Well, all right.

55
00:02:54,410 --> 00:02:55,855
Pete and I work
well together.

56
00:02:55,930 --> 00:02:58,456
Not that there's anything
special about Pete.

57
00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:00,453
It could be any guy.
Or girl.

58
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:01,975
Not that I'm into girls.

59
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:04,451
Not that I'm into Pete. Ah!
What was the question?

60
00:03:06,210 --> 00:03:07,291
Hey.
Hey, Jim.

61
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:09,651
Peter Rowley at Bridgeport Capital
requested a meeting at lunch.

62
00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:11,290
Okay-

63
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:12,815
Can we keep it on
the early side, though?

64
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:14,341
I've got that thing
in Scranton later.

65
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:16,016
Oh, sure.
No problem.

66
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:19,618
Cece's ballet recital
is today! I cannot wait!

67
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:21,375
I've been working
with her on her move.

68
00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:22,975
It's called
the Cece Spin and Kiss.

69
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:24,700
Do you want to see it?
It's kind of like this.

70
00:03:28,570 --> 00:03:29,776
It's pretty cute, right?

71
00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:35,256
"Athlead."

72
00:03:35,330 --> 00:03:38,857
Please. They're too lazy
to call it Athletes Lead?

73
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:43,732
Jim should just call
it Stumpany for stupid company.

74
00:03:43,970 --> 00:03:46,018
There's nothing stupid
about working for yourself,

75
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:47,455
hanging out
with pro athletes,

76
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:49,817
getting free tickets to the games.
That's why I'm doing it.

77
00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:51,655
You're working
for Stumpany, too?

78
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:54,097
Yeah. Just weekends for now, but
pretty soon I'm switching over.

79
00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:55,735
What?
Yup.

80
00:03:56,930 --> 00:03:58,614
Hey, Halpert,
what's the big idea?

81
00:03:58,690 --> 00:04:01,819
First you jump ship, now you're
stealing Darryl, too? When will it end?

82
00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:04,980
Well, take your worst fear
and multiply it by infinity.

83
00:04:05,170 --> 00:04:08,060
You won't stop until you've
poached us all. Yeah.

84
00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:10,100
Even you.
No!

85
00:04:10,170 --> 00:04:12,616
I'll be damned if I'm
going to let us lose me.

86
00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:14,055
Bye, Dwight.

87
00:04:17,330 --> 00:04:19,014
How are you? Good to see you.
Thank you.

88
00:04:19,450 --> 00:04:23,580
Hey, Angela, did you hear about the
Irish-American Cultural Center mural?

89
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:25,494
Ooh, I haven't heard it!

90
00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:29,370
So, what about the Irish-American
Cultural Center mural?

91
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:32,814
Potato? Oh, no. Kevin,
it's not a joke.

92
00:04:32,890 --> 00:04:36,053
Angela's husband put me up for a...
Um. Just never mind.

93
00:04:36,530 --> 00:04:38,100
I have no information.
But I'm sure

94
00:04:38,170 --> 00:04:39,695
as soon as they
know they'll call you.

95
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:42,173
Senator Lipton
helped me submit my design

96
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:44,139
for a new mural on
a building downtown.

97
00:04:44,330 --> 00:04:46,492
Now I'm just waiting to hear
from the selection committee.

98
00:04:46,570 --> 00:04:48,652
But, you know,
let's be realistic,

99
00:04:48,730 --> 00:04:52,416
there are a ton of great artists in
Scranton with way more experience.

100
00:04:52,610 --> 00:04:53,850
I mean, who are
they going to go with,

101
00:04:53,930 --> 00:04:57,252
some nobody like me, or a
big name like Tracy Fleeb?

102
00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:00,696
Well, I'm heading out
to Cece's dance recital.

103
00:05:00,770 --> 00:05:02,010
Aw.

104
00:05:04,290 --> 00:05:06,531
Hey, Cece! Daddy's going to
have dinner with us tonight,

105
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:09,011
after he comes to your recital.
Are you excited?

106
00:05:09,090 --> 00:05:10,171
Yeah!

107
00:05:10,290 --> 00:05:11,371
Let's call him!

108
00:05:15,410 --> 00:05:17,139
Hey. I was just
about to call you.

109
00:05:17,210 --> 00:05:19,053
Hey, hon! Are you close?

110
00:05:19,130 --> 00:05:21,178
I am still in Philly,
actually.

111
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:22,941
What'?
It's insane.

112
00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:25,132
This huge
investor got cold feet,

113
00:05:25,210 --> 00:05:26,974
so I'm stuck here trying
to keep him on board.

114
00:05:27,170 --> 00:05:29,172
Hon! I wish you would
have told me an hour ago

115
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:31,014
when you knew you
weren't going to make it.

116
00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:34,294
Pam, I couldn't get out! I barely made
it out just to make this phone call.

117
00:05:34,570 --> 00:05:35,935
I want Daddy!

118
00:05:36,010 --> 00:05:37,375
You're going to do great.

119
00:05:37,610 --> 00:05:40,181
And you know what? Mommy's going to
record it, so we'll watch it together.

120
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:41,411
Do you mind
doing that, Pam?

121
00:05:41,490 --> 00:05:42,537
Of course.

122
00:05:42,650 --> 00:05:45,574
Okay, are you sure you know
how to do video on the phone?

123
00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:49,211
Yes, Jim, I think I know how to
point a rectangle at something.

124
00:05:49,290 --> 00:05:52,134
Okay, okay. Just sometimes you're
not the best with the phone.

125
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:55,618
I know how to operate my phone, okay?
Listen, we're getting close.

126
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:58,734
We will talk to you later.
Say bye, Daddy!

127
00:05:58,810 --> 00:06:00,653
Bye, Daddy.
Bye.

128
00:06:02,650 --> 00:06:04,618
Yeah, see? You've still
got to press end, Pam.

129
00:06:04,690 --> 00:06:05,930
Press end.

130
00:06:08,010 --> 00:06:09,819
Oh, check it out,
this is our first real like!

131
00:06:09,890 --> 00:06:11,051
Oh, my God!

132
00:06:11,130 --> 00:06:13,451
Alan Olifson
from North Dakota.

133
00:06:13,530 --> 00:06:15,737
He also likes Hammermill
and Georgia Pacific.

134
00:06:15,850 --> 00:06:18,251
Wow, that guy's really into paper.
Yeah.

135
00:06:18,330 --> 00:06:19,616
Well done, you two.

136
00:06:19,690 --> 00:06:20,896
We did it!

137
00:06:21,170 --> 00:06:22,854
Youth Task Force forever!
Yes!

138
00:06:22,930 --> 00:06:24,500
Bap, bap, bap-

139
00:06:24,970 --> 00:06:27,052
And then... Oh, wait.
No, you go...

140
00:06:27,170 --> 00:06:29,093
Did I... Is that you? No, you
go first, and then it's a left.

141
00:06:29,170 --> 00:06:30,615
No, you go... Okay, all right.
No, I didn't...

142
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:31,657
All right,
okay, start over.

143
00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:33,420
You always mess that part up.
Oh, no, no, no.

144
00:06:33,690 --> 00:06:36,170
Oh, God! Andy has just
started to be nice to me

145
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:37,581
and now I've
sent his girlfriend

146
00:06:37,650 --> 00:06:39,220
into the arms
of a younger man!

147
00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:42,533
And I cc'ed him
on every incriminating memo.

148
00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:44,898
"Pete and Erin,
don't hold back.

149
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:46,814
"Our social media
presence should be

150
00:06:46,890 --> 00:06:48,699
"hot, hot, hot.
Go at it vigorously."

151
00:06:49,090 --> 00:06:51,536
I did everything but unzip
their pants for them.

152
00:06:52,330 --> 00:06:54,059
Oh, God, Nellie!

153
00:06:55,210 --> 00:06:58,100
Hey, everybody, uh, a coffee
order is going around.

154
00:06:58,170 --> 00:07:00,901
On me! Just sign your name below.
Hmm.

155
00:07:01,050 --> 00:07:02,131
You're welcome.

156
00:07:02,210 --> 00:07:04,258
Wait, this says "Dunder
Mifflin Loyalty Pledge."

157
00:07:04,330 --> 00:07:05,297
This? Oh, what?

158
00:07:05,410 --> 00:07:07,492
Double mocha latte, please?
You got it.

159
00:07:07,570 --> 00:07:09,379
Just sign your name below.
Whatever you want.

160
00:07:09,450 --> 00:07:10,690
WWW Wedge?

161
00:07:10,770 --> 00:07:12,295
Come on, Dwight.
Stop overreacting.

162
00:07:12,410 --> 00:07:13,935
I'm getting all
my work done here.

163
00:07:14,010 --> 00:07:16,411
No customers have complained,
nobody even knows.

164
00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:17,936
Yeah, we'll see about that.

165
00:07:19,810 --> 00:07:21,175
Bust out
your complaint files.

166
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:22,854
I need everything
you've got on Darryl since

167
00:07:22,970 --> 00:07:24,779
he started working for Jim
in the last few weeks.

168
00:07:24,890 --> 00:07:27,131
Break it down
by keyword, okay?

169
00:07:27,210 --> 00:07:29,019
Infuriating,
irresponsible...

170
00:07:29,090 --> 00:07:31,058
They've got us set
up with Windows 95,

171
00:07:31,170 --> 00:07:33,138
so you're kind
of dreaming here.

172
00:07:34,290 --> 00:07:37,180
Okay, I'm going to
need you to print it out.

173
00:07:52,450 --> 00:07:56,500
Customer loyalty.
What is it?

174
00:07:58,450 --> 00:07:59,940
Can you hold
it in your hand?

175
00:08:00,330 --> 00:08:03,618
Can you nudge it with your finger?
Can you dump it on a woman?

176
00:08:03,770 --> 00:08:08,298
No! Why? Because it's an idea.
But what does it mean?

177
00:08:08,610 --> 00:08:10,851
Oh, it's when you
get a free sandwich

178
00:08:10,930 --> 00:08:13,297
after you've already
eaten 10 sandwiches.

179
00:08:13,450 --> 00:08:14,940
Not even close.

180
00:08:15,010 --> 00:08:17,820
Mr. Romanko has been
a client for 20 years.

181
00:08:17,890 --> 00:08:19,733
He came in today
in a rage.

182
00:08:19,810 --> 00:08:21,255
Why? Because of Darryl,

183
00:08:21,810 --> 00:08:25,656
because Darryl was focusing
on outside projects

184
00:08:25,810 --> 00:08:29,895
and needs to remember his
first priority, the client.

185
00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:31,491
I wouldn't say a rage.

186
00:08:31,570 --> 00:08:34,574
Mr. Romanko, we were a day late
on one of your deliveries,

187
00:08:34,650 --> 00:08:36,573
but two of our trucks
were down for repairs.

188
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:38,254
It's very unlikely
it will happen again.

189
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:40,299
Thank you,
thank you.

190
00:08:40,370 --> 00:08:42,338
No, you're not
going anywhere, okay?

191
00:08:42,410 --> 00:08:45,061
You are angry and we are
going to hear you out!

192
00:08:45,130 --> 00:08:47,781
All right? Because business
is about relationships,

193
00:08:47,850 --> 00:08:50,091
and the key to relationships
is what, Darryl?

194
00:08:51,610 --> 00:08:52,611
L...

195
00:08:52,690 --> 00:08:54,101
It.
LoYa V Loyaw

196
00:08:54,170 --> 00:08:55,934
"Loyalty" is exactly right!

197
00:08:56,010 --> 00:08:58,900
Thank you. Yes, I
mean, it is everything.

198
00:08:59,090 --> 00:09:03,220
Let's all ask ourselves, have we
been faithful in our relationships?

199
00:09:03,330 --> 00:09:05,094
Mmm. That's none of
your damn business.

200
00:09:05,530 --> 00:09:08,932
Darryl is
"dating" Dunder Mifflin.

201
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:12,219
Darryl is dating Val.
Still.

202
00:09:12,810 --> 00:09:17,941
But he's flirting with
Jim's company on the side.

203
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:21,660
And we all know what
flirting can lead to.

204
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:24,137
I'm sorry, do I still
need to be here? Yes.

205
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:28,460
I'm still having a bit of trouble
understanding the importance of loyalty.

206
00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:31,301
So, let's use an example.
Take Erin.

207
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:35,341
Erin's boyfriend, Andy,
is away across the ocean.

208
00:09:35,490 --> 00:09:36,537
Yeah.

209
00:09:36,650 --> 00:09:41,212
So is it all right for her to
flirt with Creed, for example?

210
00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:42,780
Let's try it out.

211
00:09:42,970 --> 00:09:46,099
No, let's not say Creed.
Let's say Mr. X.

212
00:09:46,570 --> 00:09:49,221
Well, I think it would be immoral
for Erin to cheat on Andy.

213
00:09:49,530 --> 00:09:51,294
Oh, I'm sorry,
didn't you cheat on Andy?

214
00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:53,379
Yes, and he didn't like it.

215
00:09:53,730 --> 00:09:56,415
Does Mr. X know that
Erin has a boyfriend,

216
00:09:56,490 --> 00:09:59,494
or did Erin keep
that from Mr. X?

217
00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:02,495
Okay, this is
really hard to follow.

218
00:10:02,570 --> 00:10:05,813
Can we just say Pete, 'cause that's
the guy that Erin's flirting with?

219
00:10:11,050 --> 00:10:13,656
Ladies and gentlemen,
the Little Ladybug Ballerinas!

220
00:10:20,010 --> 00:10:23,014
Plié. One, two, three!

221
00:10:25,690 --> 00:10:27,692
Really?
I'm sorry. Sorry.

222
00:10:30,610 --> 00:10:33,090
Hello?
Yes, this is Pam Halpert.

223
00:10:33,810 --> 00:10:36,097
I got the mural! Oh, my God!

224
00:10:37,090 --> 00:10:40,299
Um, I'm sorry, I have to go.
My daughter is a ladybug.

225
00:10:40,930 --> 00:10:43,979
I know that doesn't make any sense.
Um, thank you, thank you!

226
00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:46,533
You're very rude.
Yes. Very rude.

227
00:10:46,610 --> 00:10:48,499
Kids are dancing!

228
00:10:53,650 --> 00:10:55,175
Thank you
so much for coming!

229
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:56,854
Darryl and I will
be here to serve you

230
00:10:56,970 --> 00:11:01,419
for years and
years and years and years.

231
00:11:02,930 --> 00:11:06,139
So, should we go call Jim and go
tell him to go screw himself?

232
00:11:06,610 --> 00:11:10,092
Dwight, look. I'm sorry you're
having a hard time with this, okay?

233
00:11:10,490 --> 00:11:12,299
Athlead is my future.

234
00:11:12,730 --> 00:11:14,414
No disrespect
to Dunder Mifflin,

235
00:11:14,490 --> 00:11:16,379
but if I can have fun
at work, I want that.

236
00:11:16,770 --> 00:11:18,977
It can't be more fun than selling
paper and paper products.

237
00:11:19,370 --> 00:11:21,338
It can. Are you
pretending to be crazy?

238
00:11:21,650 --> 00:11:22,651
Huh?

239
00:11:23,570 --> 00:11:25,379
Well, Andy's cute,
but he's too vanilla.

240
00:11:25,450 --> 00:11:27,737
Whereas Pete,
he's just one sick dude.

241
00:11:27,810 --> 00:11:29,892
I mean, you know this
guy likes to get weird.

242
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:31,695
I'm just going to
say this one more time,

243
00:11:31,770 --> 00:11:33,693
Pete and I
haven't done anything.

244
00:11:33,770 --> 00:11:35,056
It's true!
Yeah, right.

245
00:11:35,130 --> 00:11:37,940
With slamming bods like that?
They ain't playing checkers.

246
00:11:38,050 --> 00:11:41,532
People, it's 2013. Erin is a
strong, independent woman.

247
00:11:42,010 --> 00:11:43,694
Who says she has to
end up with any man?

248
00:11:46,770 --> 00:11:49,853
Okay, can everyone
please stop speaking for me?

249
00:11:49,930 --> 00:11:52,820
Andy is my boyfriend,
Pete and I are just friends.

250
00:11:52,890 --> 00:11:54,255
And that is the end of it!
Right, Pete?

251
00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:55,571
That is correct.

252
00:11:55,770 --> 00:11:58,694
Come on, guys. Where is
this even coming from?

253
00:11:59,050 --> 00:12:02,020
Your feelings for Erin?
Probably your heart.

254
00:12:02,690 --> 00:12:04,340
And a little bit your penis.

255
00:12:04,410 --> 00:12:06,219
Kevin, really?

256
00:12:06,610 --> 00:12:08,419
Nellie, you have to shut down
Youth Task Force.

257
00:12:08,530 --> 00:12:11,693
I'm not sure if you need to start
a new task force to do that,

258
00:12:11,770 --> 00:12:13,374
but please just do
whatever it takes.

259
00:12:14,210 --> 00:12:17,817
I suppose that will
be all right. Yeah.

260
00:12:18,050 --> 00:12:20,940
Most relationships
eventually die on their own.

261
00:12:21,010 --> 00:12:24,492
But sometimes they just need a
little pillow over the face.

262
00:12:24,570 --> 00:12:28,461
You're welcome, Andy. And
you're welcome, my own ass.

263
00:12:29,130 --> 00:12:32,737
Listen, I appreciate
you taking the time with me.

264
00:12:32,970 --> 00:12:35,576
Peter, please, we completely
understand your concerns here.

265
00:12:35,650 --> 00:12:38,051
Let us just show you
the latest projections. Jim?

266
00:12:38,170 --> 00:12:39,740
Wade actually has those,
on the road,

267
00:12:39,810 --> 00:12:41,175
but he's going to be
calling in with those

268
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:43,457
numbers any second.
So just hold on one...

269
00:12:43,530 --> 00:12:45,771
Actually...

270
00:12:45,970 --> 00:12:47,301
Ah, nope.

271
00:12:47,450 --> 00:12:49,452
That is my wife.

272
00:12:49,530 --> 00:12:51,339
Again, he'll be
calling in any second.

273
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:53,937
Hey, give me a call back
when you get a chance.

274
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:57,220
Cece did great and I want
to tell you something.

275
00:12:57,730 --> 00:12:59,573
Hey, boss, you've got
to jump on a delivery.

276
00:13:00,090 --> 00:13:02,172
I don't do that anymore.
That's what they told me.

277
00:13:06,930 --> 00:13:08,500
All right,
let's get this over with.

278
00:13:08,930 --> 00:13:10,261
You looking for fun?

279
00:13:10,490 --> 00:13:11,730
It just found you!

280
00:13:11,810 --> 00:13:14,051
Whoo!

281
00:13:15,410 --> 00:13:18,095
Here we go! Yeah!

282
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:23,094
Yes, we will be delivering
a shipment of paper today,

283
00:13:23,170 --> 00:13:28,301
but I will also be delivering
you a big shipment of fun!

284
00:13:31,930 --> 00:13:33,534
How far is this place?

285
00:13:34,490 --> 00:13:39,451
Uh, not far at all, but I thought along
the way we could play some sports!

286
00:13:41,770 --> 00:13:42,931
Fun.

287
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:45,970
Hey, really nice job
in that meeting in there.

288
00:13:46,370 --> 00:13:47,496
Oh, thank you. I don't
know, I still thought...

289
00:13:47,570 --> 00:13:48,617
Yeah.

290
00:13:48,770 --> 00:13:50,215
I'm so proud of you, hon.

291
00:13:50,290 --> 00:13:52,497
Oh, I don't know. Okay.

292
00:13:53,810 --> 00:13:55,733
Just curious, though, what do
you have against Pete and Erin?

293
00:13:55,810 --> 00:13:58,131
Well, Andy wrote me a really
nice recommendation letter

294
00:13:58,210 --> 00:14:00,258
for the adoption agency,

295
00:14:00,330 --> 00:14:01,900
so I just felt
like I owed him one.

296
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:03,381
Pete's a pretty
cool guy, though.

297
00:14:04,570 --> 00:14:07,255
And Andy was
a terrible lover to Erin.

298
00:14:07,730 --> 00:14:10,813
He basically ignored her,
and then left on a boat.

299
00:14:11,170 --> 00:14:13,013
I didn't really
think about it like that.

300
00:14:13,130 --> 00:14:17,613
Em, well, not everybody
has what we have.

301
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:21,140
What we have?
Hmm.

302
00:14:22,370 --> 00:14:23,610
I just remembered.

303
00:14:24,890 --> 00:14:26,574
I kissed that man.

304
00:14:29,450 --> 00:14:31,373
Oh, no. Oh, no.

305
00:14:32,690 --> 00:14:34,772
Yes! Fast food.

306
00:14:35,490 --> 00:14:38,812
I'll take a burger over a gross
Philly cheese-steak any day.

307
00:14:39,010 --> 00:14:40,091
They have
fast food in Philly.

308
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:41,251
Not like this.

309
00:14:41,610 --> 00:14:42,691
Exactly like this.

310
00:14:43,290 --> 00:14:44,416
And your milkshake.

311
00:14:44,490 --> 00:14:45,491
Thank you.

312
00:14:45,570 --> 00:14:47,652
It's 30 degrees out,
you're drinking a milkshake?

313
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:49,256
Nope.

314
00:14:49,690 --> 00:14:50,930
Fire in the hole!

315
00:14:51,010 --> 00:14:52,739
Yeah!

316
00:14:53,370 --> 00:14:56,021
Now that's what working at a
paper company is all about!

317
00:14:56,850 --> 00:14:59,091
Wait, what are you doing? No, I
need the keys! We have to go!

318
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:01,856
You just threw a milkshake into a
restaurant where they make minimum wage.

319
00:15:02,050 --> 00:15:04,701
It's a YouTube thing! Let's go, let's go!
Come on. They're coming!

320
00:15:05,010 --> 00:15:07,092
Anyone want to see the video
from Cece's recital?

321
00:15:07,330 --> 00:15:10,413
Oh, I would love to,
but I am swamped.

322
00:15:11,930 --> 00:15:13,056
That.

323
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:16,180
I'll watch it.
Let's get this over with.

324
00:15:16,490 --> 00:15:18,254
All right,
you don't have to...

325
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:20,851
Let's get
this over with, Pam.

326
00:15:20,930 --> 00:15:22,136
Okay-

327
00:15:25,490 --> 00:15:27,140
Wait, what?

328
00:15:27,570 --> 00:15:29,493
Sorry, I'm in a rush
to get back to work.

329
00:15:29,770 --> 00:15:33,900
Oh, no! I took a phone call
in the middle of taping

330
00:15:33,970 --> 00:15:36,735
and then when I went to turn it
back on, I must have turned it off.

331
00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:39,541
User error. I've heard it
happens to other people.

332
00:15:39,610 --> 00:15:40,657
Oscar,
don't rub it in.

333
00:15:40,730 --> 00:15:42,459
I'm sure Pam is
already kicking herself

334
00:15:42,530 --> 00:15:44,931
for choosing a phone
call over her child.

335
00:15:45,450 --> 00:15:47,737
Well, it was
an important phone call.

336
00:15:48,010 --> 00:15:50,377
I haven't told anyone here
about the mural yet.

337
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:52,293
I want Jim
to be the first to know.

338
00:15:53,090 --> 00:15:56,981
Whenever I tell him good news,
he's always like "Beesly!"

339
00:15:57,970 --> 00:15:59,654
I love that.

340
00:15:59,730 --> 00:16:01,539
The only thing better
than getting the job.

341
00:16:01,610 --> 00:16:03,260
"Beesly!"

342
00:16:09,450 --> 00:16:11,100
Hey.
Hello, Peter.

343
00:16:24,490 --> 00:16:27,460
This barely even feels
like a prank anymore.

344
00:16:28,130 --> 00:16:29,859
You missed a spot.
Fire in the hole!

345
00:16:30,850 --> 00:16:32,136
Go, go, go!

346
00:16:32,810 --> 00:16:35,859
Ha-ha, yeah,
joke's on you, buddy!

347
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:38,213
They make you come
back and clean it up.

348
00:16:40,130 --> 00:16:43,213
I am sorry that that was so awkward
for you two in that meeting,

349
00:16:43,290 --> 00:16:46,658
but I am going to have to
reassemble the Youth Task Force.

350
00:16:47,130 --> 00:16:48,894
Oh, no, I really don't
think that's a good idea.

351
00:16:48,970 --> 00:16:52,019
Well, that is not your call.
I made the decision.

352
00:16:52,450 --> 00:16:54,259
You have no
choice in the matter,

353
00:16:54,690 --> 00:16:56,101
and everybody knows it.

354
00:16:58,090 --> 00:16:59,330
Well, okay then.

355
00:16:59,410 --> 00:17:00,696
I guess we
don't have a choice.

356
00:17:00,850 --> 00:17:01,851
Nope.

357
00:17:01,930 --> 00:17:03,261
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

358
00:17:16,530 --> 00:17:17,770
Lady“.

359
00:17:21,930 --> 00:17:24,331
You never
stop surprising me.

360
00:17:31,490 --> 00:17:32,935
What?

361
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:34,535
What was that?

362
00:17:34,610 --> 00:17:37,341
Did I just hear you
laughing with glee?

363
00:17:37,850 --> 00:17:40,330
No. I was just
clearing my throat.

364
00:17:43,690 --> 00:17:45,658
Good night.
Good night.

365
00:17:46,330 --> 00:17:47,377
Night.

366
00:17:47,450 --> 00:17:48,451
Night, Creed.

367
00:17:58,290 --> 00:18:00,179
- Hey!
- Hey.

368
00:18:00,970 --> 00:18:02,210
So, how's it going?

369
00:18:02,370 --> 00:18:04,737
We lost Bridgeport Capital.

370
00:18:04,810 --> 00:18:05,891
I have no idea
what happened.

371
00:18:05,970 --> 00:18:08,257
It's like everything I did,
he just wouldn't go for it.

372
00:18:08,330 --> 00:18:09,695
PAM". I'm so sorry.

373
00:18:09,770 --> 00:18:11,932
I have no idea where we're going
to come up with this money.

374
00:18:12,010 --> 00:18:14,377
We have to work insanely hard
over the next few weeks.

375
00:18:15,810 --> 00:18:18,495
I'm sorry. I feel like you've
already been working insanely hard.

376
00:18:18,810 --> 00:18:22,178
Can you figure out how to
upload Cece's dance recital?

377
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:24,901
I definitely could
use a pick-me-up.

378
00:18:25,130 --> 00:18:28,373
Actually, funny
story, I didn't get it.

379
00:18:28,450 --> 00:18:31,374
I shouldn't have been so cocky about
my rectangle-holding skills after all.

380
00:18:31,930 --> 00:18:34,058
You're not serious,
are you?

381
00:18:34,490 --> 00:18:36,094
You didn't get
any of the recital?

382
00:18:36,450 --> 00:18:38,214
No, I got the teacher
introducing them,

383
00:18:38,290 --> 00:18:40,019
and then
the applause afterward,

384
00:18:40,090 --> 00:18:41,330
but not so much
of the middle part.

385
00:18:41,610 --> 00:18:43,692
Come on, Pam. Pam!

386
00:18:43,770 --> 00:18:45,295
I asked you if you
could use the phone

387
00:18:45,370 --> 00:18:46,860
and you swore
that you knew how.

388
00:18:46,930 --> 00:18:49,774
Yeah, okay, I'm sorry.
I'm sure we can get a copy.

389
00:18:49,850 --> 00:18:51,181
A lot of people
were taping it.

390
00:18:51,450 --> 00:18:54,818
Oh, great. So we'll see somebody else's
kid with Cece in the background?

391
00:18:55,010 --> 00:18:57,934
I mean, it's really not
that hard to film a video.

392
00:18:58,290 --> 00:18:59,940
Is there... Um.

393
00:19:00,770 --> 00:19:02,215
You want to ease
up a little bit?

394
00:19:02,450 --> 00:19:05,533
Look, Pam, I don't know what to tell you.
I mean, what do I do?

395
00:19:05,610 --> 00:19:08,090
It's gone, that moment's just gone.
I missed it.

396
00:19:08,290 --> 00:19:10,418
I don't know, Jim. Maybe you
should have been there.

397
00:19:10,690 --> 00:19:12,533
You're not serious,
right?

398
00:19:12,610 --> 00:19:14,612
I mean,
how is that fair?

399
00:19:14,970 --> 00:19:17,894
I'm in Philly, these are my days in Philly.
You've agreed to this.

400
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:19,621
You know what?
I don't think

401
00:19:19,690 --> 00:19:21,055
you want to start
a conversation with me

402
00:19:21,130 --> 00:19:22,416
about what's fair, okay?

403
00:19:22,810 --> 00:19:24,812
This is way more
intense than I ever...

404
00:19:24,890 --> 00:19:26,858
Pam, I'm not
explaining this to you.

405
00:19:26,970 --> 00:19:28,131
Pam, I'm not going over this again.
Jim?

406
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:30,298
I don't know how else to...
We need you.

407
00:19:30,450 --> 00:19:32,373
I don't know how
else to tell you, okay?

408
00:19:32,490 --> 00:19:34,970
I'm doing everything
I can, every week

409
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:36,580
to bring home something for our family.
lam... lam...

410
00:19:36,650 --> 00:19:39,221
lam trying to make everything
perfect here, okay,

411
00:19:39,330 --> 00:19:41,776
so that you can have
everything that you want.

412
00:19:42,050 --> 00:19:44,257
I'm doing this just for me?
Is that what I'm doing?

413
00:19:44,330 --> 00:19:45,491
I'm doing it just for me?

414
00:19:46,010 --> 00:19:49,571
If that's what you think, then
this is a really sad night.

415
00:19:49,650 --> 00:19:51,459
You know what?
I got to go.

416
00:19:51,530 --> 00:19:53,020
Okay?
Yup

417
00:19:54,050 --> 00:19:55,814
We'll talk tomorrow?

418
00:19:56,290 --> 00:19:58,770
Yup. I'll talk
to you tomorrow.

419
00:19:59,330 --> 00:20:01,776
All right, great.
I'll talk to you tomorrow.

420
00:20:02,450 --> 00:20:03,656
Bye.

421
00:20:19,650 --> 00:20:21,334
Hey, are you okay?

422
00:20:24,050 --> 00:20:25,973
What am I doing wrong,
Bflan?

423
00:20:26,050 --> 00:20:27,575
Nothing. You're doing
the best you can.

424
00:20:27,690 --> 00:20:29,135
Brian.

425
00:20:29,210 --> 00:20:30,939
Give her a minute.

426
00:20:35,730 --> 00:20:38,461
It's just a tough
situation, all right?

427
00:20:39,130 --> 00:20:40,939
It's getting tougher.

428
00:20:41,690 --> 00:20:44,375
I just didn't know that
it was going to be this hard.

429
00:20:44,450 --> 00:20:45,531
Yeah.

430
00:20:45,970 --> 00:20:50,055
Let's turn the cameras off.
Seriously, guys? Enough. Enough.

431
00:20:52,410 --> 00:20:53,935
Thank you.

432
00:20:56,570 --> 00:20:58,652
Fire in the hole!

433
00:20:59,570 --> 00:21:01,174
Go! Go! Go!

434
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:07,059
I nailed that guy!

435
00:21:07,610 --> 00:21:09,419
And replay.

436
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:12,981
Fire in the hole!

437
00:21:14,930 --> 00:21:16,375
Go! Go! Go!

438
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:19,139
I nailed that guy!

439
00:21:20,930 --> 00:21:23,501
I'm going to miss
the paper business.
