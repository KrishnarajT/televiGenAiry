1
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:15,406
The tea in Nepal is very hot.

2
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,881
"But the coffee in Peru
is much hotter."

3
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:26,689
Last week,
I finally became permanent

4
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:28,564
manager of Dunder Mifflin,
Scranton!

5
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:31,325
My first project,
increase security.

6
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:32,925
I got these doors
from a jewelry store

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,445
that had recently
gone out of business.

8
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:38,326
Now they're protecting
America's real treasure, papefl

9
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:41,529
Every morning, I e-mail
the day's security codes.

10
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:43,324
Something that's
been really missing

11
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:45,169
from my life has been
writing secret codes.

12
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:48,289
It's not the KGB,
but it's a start.

13
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:53,651
The tea in Nepal is very hot.

14
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:55,688
But the coffee in Peru
is far hotter.

15
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:57,205
Close.

16
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:00,208
This is Tuesday, right?

17
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:02,681
The coffee in Paraguay
is far hotter?

18
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:04,000
Colder.

19
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:05,446
The coffee in Paraguay
is colder?

20
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:07,289
No, I meant you
were getting colder.

21
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:11,490
The correct response is, "The
coffee in Peru is much hotter."

22
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:13,005
Ah. "Much," okay.

23
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:15,367
But that's three wrongs, so
I've got to give you the steam.

24
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:17,363
No. Unless you want
me to break protocol.

25
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,880
No, no. Give me the steam.

26
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:34,126
It's just harmless
steam to panic intruders.

27
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:37,249
I'd like to get harmful steam,
but the prices are absurd.

28
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:43,081
Break protocol!

29
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:45,681
Oh, I'm saving
a fortune on dry-cleaning.

30
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:20,171
Mama.

31
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:21,606
Angela, someone wants you.

32
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,409
Okay. Coming.

33
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:27,607
Hi, baby.

34
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,648
Angela's divorce
from the Senator

35
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,683
has been very
difficult for her.

36
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:34,007
When she got kicked
out of her apartment,

37
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:36,282
I invited her to
move in with me.

38
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:39,842
Ironic that now it's Angela
who's living in the closet.

39
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,206
Hey-o!

40
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:44,004
Saddle shoes with denim?

41
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:47,281
I will, literally, call
Child Protective Services.

42
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:56,246
Go get 'em, honey.

43
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:58,561
Don't worry.
They'll get got.

44
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,169
Manager of
Dunder Mifflin? Check.

45
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:03,811
Owner of a 1,600
acre beet farm? Check.

46
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:07,930
Engaged to be married to an
actual milk maid? Check...

47
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:10,844
on that later today.

48
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:14,003
This is
my grandmother's ring.

49
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:17,561
It was made from a bullet I
took out of her left buttock.

50
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:20,166
She was a moonshiner
shot by Adolph Coors.

51
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:23,369
This is my grandmother's
buttock bullet ring.

52
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,320
Hi. Good morning.

53
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,402
Name is Andrew Bernard.

54
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:32,811
You might know me from a TV documentary
that's premiering tonight.

55
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:35,247
Also killed it
in local theater

56
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:38,961
and I'm fresh off of
a hot industrial flick.

57
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,405
Okay. Thanks.

58
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:41,970
Go ahead and get in
the back of the line.

59
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,650
Yes!

60
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:52,206
Well, I burned all
my bridges at Dunder Mifflin,

61
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:54,521
and time to become
the next American Idol

62
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:58,047
by winning America's Next
A Cappella Sensation

63
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:00,009
on Channel TBD!

64
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:02,250
It's a really cool show.
It's like a total

65
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,885
reinvention of
the whole American Idol,

66
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:06,201
Voice, Sing-Off phenomenon.

67
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:09,090
On this show all
three judges are mean!

68
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,768
Sales form for
you to sign.

69
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,171
You know what to do.

70
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,006
Okay-

71
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:30,684
Behind every
great regional manager

72
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,404
is a great assistant
to the regional manager.

73
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,720
And I have chosen
one of the best.

74
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,086
Aw. Thanks, man.

75
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,685
Once upon a time,
we were natural enemies.

76
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,404
But we've overcome
our differences,

77
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:40,050
much like Germany and Italy,
in World War...

78
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,730
Nope.

79
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:42,926
Good call.

80
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,128
Together we run
a no-nonsense office.

81
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,848
Pre-conference room meeting
with Dwight went really well.

82
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:00,843
Oh! Bodes well for the
post-conference room meeting.

83
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:02,922
All depends on the conference
room meeting itself.

84
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:06,764
Okay-

85
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:08,126
Was that them again?

86
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:09,520
Yeah.

87
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,806
Maybe you should
call them back.

88
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:15,327
I will.

89
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:18,569
The guys at Athlead
are still bugging me

90
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:20,603
about this
three-month road show thing.

91
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:23,445
Meeting athletes on their home
turf, building relationships.

92
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:27,525
Yeah, it sounds exciting. But
I said no, and that's final.

93
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:32,685
I almost lost Pam over this business.
I'm not risking that again.

94
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,204
When Jim decided
to come back to

95
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:36,970
Scranton full time,
I was relieved

96
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:40,203
but I also feel
a little guilty.

97
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:43,329
I mean, he's giving up
this big thing for me.

98
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:47,567
But he seems happy. He's certainly
been goofing around a lot.

99
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,403
I love goofy Jim.

100
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:52,482
Welcome.
He welcomes you.

101
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,846
Please
take an agenda item.

102
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,365
Your agenda-taking
pleases him.

103
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,845
Have a seat, Phyllis.

104
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,081
Here we go.

105
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:01,164
As you know, I like to begin each
day with an inspirational quote.

106
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:05,643
Some say, the only failure there
is, is the failure to try.

107
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:09,884
That is wrong.
Failure of any kind is failure.

108
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:11,007
Jim, over to you.

109
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:13,811
Let's not get crazy and ruin
our no-nonsense streak.

110
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:17,168
All right? So, for instance, if
you're expecting a fax today,

111
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:21,040
please don't yell out, "Michael J.
Fax, from Fax to the Future!"

112
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,690
Okay? That's nonsense.

113
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:24,649
Question. Yes, beautiful
girl in the front?

114
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:28,529
We are expecting a water
delivery today at 10:00 a.m.

115
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,523
What if as they're
delivering the waterjugs

116
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,608
someone screams out,
"Nice jugs!"

117
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:34,364
That's obviously
nonsense.

118
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:35,521
Nonsense.

119
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:39,525
And what percentage of nonsense
do we tolerate in this office?

120
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,841
Zero percentage
of nonsense.

121
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:42,921
Can't have nonsense.

122
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,041
What is going on?

123
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,690
Daycare won't
take Phillip anymore.

124
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:47,205
Why?

125
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,282
Apparently my station
in life has descended

126
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,488
to a depth even
they won't forgive.

127
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:53,210
So, hi.

128
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:54,966
Hi, buddy.

129
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:57,850
Okay, new agenda item,

130
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:00,241
Phillip will be joining us
at the office today.

131
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,446
Got to write that down.

132
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:05,167
Okay, big day today, airing of
the documentary. Who's excited?

133
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:08,482
I'd better come out of this
smelling like a rose.

134
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:11,404
I've been on my best
behavior for nine years.

135
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:15,087
If it wasn't for the cameras I
would've done some truly vulgar crap.

136
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:17,885
Over the course of this documentary,
I've had three affairs.

137
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:19,849
If you find my body
in a ditch,

138
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:21,883
let me save
the police some trouble.

139
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:23,724
My wife did it.

140
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:27,088
I'm letting you all off half an
hour early to view the documentary.

141
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,605
So you can make it
up to me by working

142
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,210
an extra half
an hour tomorrow,

143
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:32,601
or a minute extra for
the rest of the month.

144
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:36,082
Ooh, announcement. Some of us
whose televisions got broken

145
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:38,288
during an all-you-can-eat-shrimp
commercial

146
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,528
will be watching
tonight at Poor Richard's.

147
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:43,007
But note, all are welcome,

148
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:46,368
not just those who saw an
all-you-can-eat-shrimp commercial

149
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:49,211
and charged
their televisions.

150
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:52,170
I can't believe the doc
is finally going to air.

151
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:56,086
When this thing started, I was
still having sex with women.

152
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,447
As was Kevin, I believe.

153
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,443
This airs tonight?

154
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:01,851
Oh, my God.

155
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:05,285
If my parents see this,
I am toast.

156
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,284
This is really huge.

157
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:14,283
This is like the March on
Washington but for a singing show.

158
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:17,130
Can you imagine if Martin
Luther King were here

159
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:19,407
and sang I Dreamed
a Dream from Les Miz?

160
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:22,165
With that baritone?
That would be historic.

161
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,971
Whoo-hoo! Casey Dean!
Cincinnati, Ohio!

162
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:27,247
Doctor, Doctor
Give me the news

163
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:30,130
I got a great
Casey Dean for you

164
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,281
Whoa. No.
America!

165
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:34,961
No, this is my time. You don't belt
on my time, I belt on my time.

166
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:37,281
Casey Dean

167
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:41,405
Casey Dean

168
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:46,329
Man, those are some nice pipes.
Yeah.

169
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,731
What's your name?

170
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,605
What's yours?

171
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:56,241
Why didn't you
pack the apple snacks?

172
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,446
Guys.

173
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:58,721
Because whenever
I pack the bag

174
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,165
you say I do it wrong.

175
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,730
Guys. Guys.
Why don't you pack it?

176
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:02,961
Kevin, what?
Kevin, what is it?

177
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:05,407
Do you want to see
a video of a weatherman

178
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:08,609
who says "bold front"
instead of "cold front"?

179
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:10,011
Ifsinsane!

180
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,401
Not now, Kevin.
Can't you see we're busy?

181
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,369
Phillip needs
his apple snacks!

182
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:15,646
Seriously, Kevin.

183
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:16,926
I'm just going to
have to go to the store.

184
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,366
Okay,
you go to the store.

185
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:22,843
Phillip. Phillip. Phillip.
It's all about Phillip.

186
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:25,491
I hate Phillip.

187
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,530
Not now! Private time.

188
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,523
I love Star Wars as
much as the next guy...

189
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,602
Hey, hey! Seriously?

190
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:38,602
My God. I'm so sorry.

191
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,405
Well, this might
make up for it.

192
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:45,326
I think I have found an enormous
source of overlooked PFN.

193
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:47,646
Which is, of course...

194
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:49,040
Potential Future Nonsense.

195
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:52,044
Yes. Good abbreviating, Jim.
That saved some time.

196
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:53,246
Now hurry up, shut the door!

197
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:56,481
Break it down for me.

198
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,801
I'm going to need you to look
at your hierarchy mobile.

199
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:00,847
You've got
a regional manager.

200
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,041
The power source.

201
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:04,407
Obviously. The assistant
to the regional manager.

202
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,005
The loyal but
bungling apostle.

203
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:10,125
But what about the assistant
assistant to the regional manager?

204
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:17,325
Someone to whisper in
the ear of the consigliere.

205
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:18,401
Exactly.

206
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:21,404
I'd have to get some
more wire and string.

207
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:22,720
But it's doable.

208
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,928
Do you think any of them
out there are capable?

209
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,126
Yeah, right.

210
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:28,202
I mean, unless they're
willing to pass some tests.

211
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:30,248
I like the sound of that.

212
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,401
What did you have in mind?

213
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:32,965
Well,
I know this sounds crazy,

214
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,849
but how would
King Arthur choose

215
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:36,724
the next knight
of his Round Table?

216
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:41,684
That doesn't sound crazy, Jim. That's
the sanest thing I've ever heard.

217
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:45,211
What are you
listening to?

218
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:47,282
Hmm? I'm locking in
my starting note.

219
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,727
A 440

220
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:51,524
Oh, sweet. A cappella
is all about pitch,

221
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:54,604
and I am nothing if
not a total pitch-bitch.

222
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:57,681
What's up, everybody,
and welcome to

223
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:00,281
America's Next
A Cappella Sensation.

224
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:02,522
Hi, Mark McGrath!

225
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:04,011
Oh, my God!

226
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,206
You're gorgeous!

227
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:06,401
Thank you.
Thank you so much,

228
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,642
and thank you for your patience.
And we hope to see you guys

229
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,404
within the next
five to seven hours.

230
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:13,131
Now, just to give you a couple
of parameters of the show,

231
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:16,010
each of you will sing
a song for 30 seconds,

232
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:18,208
after which our
judges will decide

233
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:20,482
if they want you in
their a cappella group.

234
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,961
Now each group will
start with 90 singers

235
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:26,442
which will compete in a series of
singing and physical challenges.

236
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:27,646
Oh!

237
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,484
And look out for
that pesky mole!

238
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:31,642
Ooh!
There's a mole?

239
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:34,326
Oops.
I'm not supposed to...

240
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:36,243
I'm not supposed to say that.
All right, no mole.

241
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,685
Forget I said it.
All right?

242
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:40,161
What mole? What are you talking about?
I already forgot about it.

243
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,321
Good man, right there.

244
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:43,607
I'll see you guys inside.
Good luck, all right?

245
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,330
Yeah!

246
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:48,051
Pour some Sugar Ray on me!

247
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,005
On a roll much? I don't
know where that came from.

248
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:51,286
That was amazing, man.
Yeah.

249
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,725
Yeah, it felt good.
It felt funny.

250
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,564
Yeah, you made a personal
connection with him.

251
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:55,971
I did! I felt it.
Big time.

252
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:58,726
What are you
so excited about?

253
00:11:58,800 --> 00:11:59,847
Nothing.

254
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:01,041
What are you up to?

255
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:06,889
Members of the office,
hear ye!

256
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,729
That means ye, Plop.

257
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:11,004
"Plop"? Still?

258
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,804
We owe Andy that much.

259
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,530
- Yeah.
- Absolutely we do.

260
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,011
Am I right, people?

261
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,281
Fine.

262
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:19,601
Today we will be
testing candidates

263
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:23,486
for the position of Assistant to the
Assistant to the Regional Manager.

264
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:25,210
Oh, heck yeah!
Nice.

265
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:27,089
You'll always
have the upper hand

266
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:31,245
when you've got a good AARM.
Trademark pending.

267
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:33,163
This is not
an excuse to blow off work

268
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:35,169
doing
carnival-like activities.

269
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:37,720
Sure, every participant
will be getting a corndog,

270
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:40,201
but that's for fueling only.
No savoring.

271
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:42,567
Wow, what an honor.
God, I envy them.

272
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:44,130
He envies you.

273
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,605
You don't need to
repeat right now.

274
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:46,801
All right.
What I'm saying.

275
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:49,451
By 2:00,
Dwight will choose himself

276
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:52,166
to be assistant to
his own assistant, me.

277
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:01,800
What's up?

278
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:03,200
What's going on?
How was the delivery?

279
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:04,964
Delivered all my
furniture to Philly.

280
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:07,520
Hey, keep it down though.
Nobody knows I'm here.

281
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:09,769
DARRYL". I hate goodbyes.

282
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:12,411
So last week, when I left
Dunder Mifflin for good,

283
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:14,164
I pulled the old Irish exit.

284
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:16,208
Just slipped out
without making a big deal.

285
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:19,170
No hard feelings.
No feelings at all.

286
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:24,371
A good assistant
knows what their superior

287
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,323
is thinking before
they even think it.

288
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:28,368
Meredith, what number
am I thinking of right now?

289
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:30,488
Uh... Two?

290
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:33,086
Nine-hundred-eighty-five
trillion seventeen.

291
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,328
Not even close,
Meredith. Come on!

292
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:37,880
Pam, what song is running
through my head right now?

293
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:40,008
Theme song from
Saved by the Bell.

294
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:42,287
Oh, my God! It was the theme
song to Boy Meets World.

295
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:43,407
Wait! No, no, no, stop.

296
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:44,925
Spouses can read
each other's minds.

297
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,530
You're trying to
give your wife this job.

298
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:48,685
That's exactly
what I was doing.

299
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:51,367
Plop, what animal
am I picturing?

300
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:52,527
A horse?

301
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:54,171
Ooh.
Exact opposite, actually.

302
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,651
What's the opposite
of a horse?

303
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:56,721
A sea horse.

304
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:57,847
A sea horse!

305
00:13:58,560 --> 00:13:59,686
Whoa.

306
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:01,730
How did you know
I was going to say that?

307
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:03,530
Say that.

308
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:06,250
Uncanny.
Uncanny.

309
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:10,971
Challenge number two. Protocol.
Clark? Yeah.

310
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,610
Do you want a corndog?

311
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:13,761
I would love a corndog.

312
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:15,569
We'll see.
You are an assistant

313
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:17,449
who's just gotten
a phone message.

314
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:19,921
I am in a meeting with
Dwight, Robert Dunder

315
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:22,526
and his niece. Uh-oh!
Look who came to join us.

316
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:24,523
The Turkish Ambassador
to Armenia,

317
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,125
Yuri Slovak, who,
by the way, is extremely

318
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,765
embarrassed about
the size of his nose.

319
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:30,647
Go ahead and read
that phone message.

320
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:32,603
Mr. Halpert, your wife
called to find out how

321
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:34,683
your meeting with
Yuri Big Nose went.

322
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:38,048
No, no, no. You don't read
it aloud like that.

323
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:40,566
God! Besides, the whole
thing is a trick question.

324
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:42,927
There's no Turkish
Ambassador to Armenia,

325
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,004
the two countries don't
have diplomatic relations.

326
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:48,880
Uncanny.

327
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:53,442
I just hope if my buddies who are
still in Afghanistan see me win,

328
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:55,488
they'll feel like
anything is possible.

329
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:58,291
Great, more screen time
for the war vet.

330
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:00,364
All you got to do is
risk your life for this

331
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,209
country and everyone
goes ga-ga for you.

332
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:03,361
Over at the porta potties,

333
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:06,171
they were interviewing a homeless
single mother with three kids.

334
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,208
What?
Yeah.

335
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:12,968
Is this a show about the
resiliency of the human spirit,

336
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:15,088
or is it a show
about singing?

337
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:16,844
I don't know, but I'm getting
really worried here.

338
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:18,046
Me, too.

339
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:20,681
Hold my place in line.

340
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:22,524
Where are you going?

341
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:24,610
They want feel-good stories?

342
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:27,724
Wait till they get
a good feel of me.

343
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,204
Thanks, man.
Thank you.

344
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:32,481
Man, take care.

345
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:34,241
Darryl! Hey!

346
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,651
Hey-

347
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:37,410
Cool, are you
coming back to say hi?

348
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:39,881
No, no.
I'm not here, actually.

349
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:41,644
These donuts are
part of my escape

350
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:43,484
from the guys at the warehouse
I didn't say goodbye to.

351
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:45,803
A-ha! How's Athlead?

352
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:46,961
We're living like rock stars!

353
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:49,042
I'm about to eat
free steak with

354
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:51,162
my sports heroes in
32 different cities!

355
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:53,129
Wow! Jim really
doesn't want to come?

356
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,645
He says he doesn't want to.

357
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:57,283
Man,
I hope he doesn't regret it.

358
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:01,005
Well, he seems really happy being
back here at Dunder Mifflin.

359
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:04,243
Jim is happy here,
selling paper at Dunder Mifflin?

360
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:05,526
That's what he says.

361
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,247
If you say so.

362
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:08,731
Hey, good seeing you,

363
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,529
and remember,
I was never here.

364
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,010
All right, man.

365
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:16,889
An assistant brings their boss
coffee with speed and dexterity,

366
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:20,521
but an assistant to the assistant
has 1,000 times more to prove.

367
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:22,045
A thousand times more.

368
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:23,810
I'll try this one.
Phyllis.

369
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:25,644
Grab both these coffees,
double-fist it,

370
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:27,489
and head through
this obstacle course.

371
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:28,766
Okay. Ooh, it's hot.

372
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:30,160
Yeah, it's real.

373
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:33,130
It's the only way
you'll learn. Okay.

374
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,690
And go ahead.

375
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,082
Oh, God, nice.

376
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:41,003
She's through the green, everybody.
Here comes yellow.

377
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:42,650
Oh, no, no, no.
A real doozie.

378
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:43,801
Phyllis?
Seriously?

379
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:44,847
Careful.

380
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:45,967
Look at that form!

381
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:47,041
Oh, God,
this is pathetic.

382
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:49,009
The boss needs his coffee!

383
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:50,491
Wow.

384
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:57,404
Here you are, sir!
Here's your coffee.

385
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:58,641
Ow! My skin!

386
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,131
Ow! Ow! Oh!

387
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,366
It burns! Ow!

388
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:05,405
Uncanny.

389
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:10,403
Darryl? Darryl!

390
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:15,405
Whoa! Oh, hey. Hey!
What's up, y'all?

391
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:17,403
You left us
without saying goodbye!

392
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:20,928
Oh. My bad.
Goodbye, everybody.

393
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,001
Hey, no way!

394
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:23,047
That is totally uncool.

395
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:24,531
Are you kidding?

396
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,165
You broke our hearts!

397
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:27,287
Get upstairs.

398
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:28,327
I don't think I should.

399
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,323
Get upstairs, mister!
Yeah!

400
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:31,731
Right now!

401
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,404
Guess I'm going upstairs.

402
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:36,165
You know, Dwight, this whole
search for the assistant thing,

403
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:37,480
none of these
people are good enough.

404
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:38,686
I know.

405
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:41,366
What I'm about to say
makes no logical sense,

406
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:44,523
and yet it might be the most
logical thing I've ever said.

407
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:46,443
Jim, this is going to
come as no surprise,

408
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:48,369
but I know exactly
what you are going to say.

409
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:51,444
The only possible assistant
to my assistant...

410
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:52,726
ls...

411
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:54,080
me.

412
00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:00,848
The new Assistant to the Assistant
to the Regional Manager is

413
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:03,364
Dwight K. Schrute!
Yes!

414
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:04,930
Yes.

415
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:07,044
Thank you.

416
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:08,844
I think you might
want to kneel for this.

417
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:12,527
And yet, the manager of Dunder
Mifflin kneels for no man.

418
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:17,880
That's it.
Okay.

419
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:19,405
You look really,
really good.

420
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:33,369
Okay, from now on, anyone
who needs to speak to me,

421
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:36,171
has got to go through
me first. All right?

422
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:43,327
Hey!

423
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:46,083
Hey.
You all right?

424
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:49,850
What's going on?

425
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:51,960
Are you happy?

426
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:53,769
Yes, I'm happy-

427
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:56,605
No, I know that you're,
Hke, happy

428
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:57,920
and you had fun today.
Yeah.

429
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,890
And that was fun. But what
about a year from now?

430
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,923
What? What about
five years from now?

431
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,047
Pam...

432
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:05,281
Because I'm so glad
you're back, baby,

433
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:08,204
but I'm just...
I was talking to Darryl,

434
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:10,521
and he was
talking about the trip,

435
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,881
and I just feel like
you're giving up so much.

436
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,606
This was my decision,
not yours.

437
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:16,966
You didn't force me.

438
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:18,121
I kind of forced
you to do it.

439
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,281
You did not
force me to do this.

440
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:20,964
Yes, I did. I don't know
how else to tell you.

441
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:22,280
I'm afraid you're
going to resent me.

442
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:24,089
I'm afraid that this is not
enough for you. Resent you?

443
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:26,845
And I'm afraid that
I'm not enough for you.

444
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:28,926
Is that really
what you think?

445
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:36,923
Notenough? I don't know how
else to explain it to her, so,

446
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:40,407
you know what? I know
it's against the rules,

447
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:42,688
but I'm going to need
a favor from you guys.

448
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:44,649
Okay. You got it, man.

449
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:53,081
I didn't realize
we were this close.

450
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:55,970
We're all a little hormonal
with the doc airing.

451
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:58,566
Are you gonna come to Poor Richard's
and watch with us tonight?

452
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,085
Uh...

453
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:02,522
Yeah, depending on traffic.

454
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:03,931
He ain't coming.

455
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:05,405
Oh, God!

456
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:09,884
These dudes are
definitely in a weird mood.

457
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:12,486
Picked the wrong day
to return a truck.

458
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:14,250
Well, it's been great.

459
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:17,085
Eleven years. A guy is in
your life for 11 years

460
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:18,764
and then he's gone
for who knows how long.

461
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:20,330
Maybe forever.

462
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:21,487
Anyhow...

463
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:22,527
Did we ever have
lunch together,

464
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:25,001
just the two of us?

465
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:26,889
You know what?
I'm going to make

466
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,843
reservations
right now at Cugino's.

467
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:30,046
Question for Darryl.

468
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:32,686
Did we ever get loaded and
listen to Zeppelin in my van?

469
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,928
Oh. Oh, I'm sure we did.

470
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:37,805
Nah, I call one hour
van time with Darryl.

471
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:40,645
Darryl, I would love to just
record some of your stories,

472
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:42,927
just let the tape
roll for six or eight

473
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:45,202
or 10 hours and
just see what we get.

474
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:47,044
Listen, guys,
we can do it all.

475
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,645
We just have to
divide Darryl's

476
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:50,325
next 12 hours into
90-minute segments.

477
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:53,131
I will go watch an e-How
video on how to use Excel,

478
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,611
and then we'll
get this started.

479
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,085
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Wait a minute!

480
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:01,170
Okay, I made the mistake of sneaking
out of here, and that's on me.

481
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:04,449
But I'm not going to spend
the rest of the day here

482
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:07,171
doing stuff with you 'cause
you're feeling sentimental.

483
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:08,884
You have to!

484
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:12,487
Hey, hey, hey, hey! I'll do
one thing with y'all.

485
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:13,846
Which thing?

486
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:16,127
I don't care. Choose amongst yourselves.
Not the van, though.

487
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:21,050
Yeah, sleep time?

488
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:23,730
Kevin. Kevin!

489
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:25,609
Oh, you know my name.

490
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:27,569
Well, that is shocking.

491
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:30,562
Kevin, could you
not do that?

492
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:34,770
What? I'm moving the ink
down in my pen, for work.

493
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:36,560
Here, use my pen.

494
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:38,967
Don't tell me what to do!

495
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:42,362
I don't need this. And you
obviously don't need me.

496
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:44,289
Kevin, where are you going?
Away!

497
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:49,682
Tell Phillip that his stupid
little baby wish came true!

498
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:54,371
He just won't go down.

499
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:56,681
It's as if he's
excited by all this paper.

500
00:21:56,760 --> 00:22:01,448
I know. Earlier today he tried to eat
some of the 24-weight letter bond.

501
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:03,045
Smart baby.

502
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:05,248
That's the most
flavorful bond.

503
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:14,089
Hey,
what's going on over here?

504
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:16,731
Some sort of singing
competition for the young'uns?

505
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:17,961
You're back!

506
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:19,286
No, it's me, Andy!

507
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:20,646
No, I know!

508
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:22,046
No, I'm wearing makeup!

509
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:23,804
You did a really great job.

510
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:25,086
Thank you.
You even look shorter.

511
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:28,004
Oh, I took out my lifts.
Yeah, unlike Andy Bernard,

512
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:29,684
this character
is my real height.

513
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:31,126
Oh.

514
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:34,687
All day long it's moo the
cows and cluck the hens.

515
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:37,883
Mmm-hmm. Get the sheep baa-ed.
Oink the pigs.

516
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:40,167
Oink the pigs.
That is very important.

517
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:42,481
Dwight, I'm telling
you all the things Ma

518
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:44,807
said after the horse
kicked her in the head.

519
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:46,331
Where are you?

520
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:49,006
Dwight?

521
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:51,242
The way that boy
looks at the Galactica,

522
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:53,607
is precisely the way
I look at the Galactica.

523
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:56,927
And he eats the same
kind of paper I do.

524
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,206
Hmm.

525
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:08,729
Thank you, Esther.
Bye.

526
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:21,561
You threw the summoning
bag at me, sir?

527
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:23,563
I need you to perform a test.

528
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:25,165
Perform a test.

529
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:26,480
On an innocent baby.

530
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:28,762
Ooh. I like
where this is going.

531
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:30,530
Unfortunately, I have
a lot on my plate today,

532
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:32,489
so I'm going to have to hand
this off to my number two.

533
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:33,800
But don't worry.

534
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:35,764
He's the best in the biz.

535
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:37,406
Damn straight.

536
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:38,760
Unless you think
he can't handle it.

537
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:40,285
Hey, he can handle it.

538
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:41,721
All right.

539
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:49,087
Listen, listen.
Shh, buddy.

540
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:51,330
Stanley is sleeping.
You don't want to

541
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:52,885
wake up the grumpy
old walrus, do you?

542
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,724
I heard that.

543
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:56,131
Mama.

544
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,563
Hey, you want me to take
the little diaper blaster?

545
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:00,802
Pam can attest,
there's no one better

546
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:03,122
at getting brats
to shut their yaps.

547
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,486
He does have a gift.

548
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:09,088
Well, he's crying for his mom, but,
okay, here you go. Careful, he bites.

549
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:10,605
Mama.
Okay.

550
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:16,366
You ever been in
a manager's office before?

551
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:19,164
Phillip, you want to
play a little game?

552
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:21,163
It's called
Schrute or Consequences?

553
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:23,368
You're going to choose
one of these two things,

554
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:26,211
a check for a million dollars

555
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:30,282
or this dirty, old beet.

556
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:32,689
Yuck! Phew!

557
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:34,321
Which will it be,

558
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:37,849
money or the beet?

559
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:40,566
Beet.

560
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:42,487
Yeah.

561
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,923
Any ordinary child
would have taken the money,

562
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:49,283
but you're no ordinary
child, are you? No.

563
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:53,684
I can tell by your gorgeous,
widely set eyes.

564
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,929
Sorry, folks. The judges
are totally swamped.

565
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:00,883
We are all done
taking auditions.

566
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:03,801
Whoa, whoa! What?

567
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:06,121
But thanks for coming out,
and please be sure to watch

568
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:07,804
America's Next
A Cappella Sensation.

569
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:09,564
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
You can't do that.

570
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:11,284
You can't do that.
We've all been waiting!

571
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:13,004
Okay.
lam going in there.

572
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:14,206
No.

573
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:15,481
Don't... Don't touch me!

574
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:16,721
I'm not touching you.

575
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:20,921
Look! Run, old man! Run!

576
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,606
Run! Run for your life!

577
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:25,484
Don't you dare.
Don't get...

578
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:27,608
I just thought you were going
to get handsy with me.

579
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:30,490
Not interested.
I'm Casey Dean.

580
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:32,005
Be seeing the last of me.

581
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:34,924
Or I meant you won't be
seeing the last of me.

582
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:39,001
Hey!

583
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:40,445
Did you manage
to feed him?

584
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:42,921
I don't know what it is, he just
keeps spitting out the nipple.

585
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,606
That's because this baby
is of superior intelligence

586
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:47,444
and can tell when
he is being tricked

587
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:49,409
out of the experience
of a real human breast.

588
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:50,760
Come on.

589
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:52,120
He's not that smart.

590
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:54,771
He doesn't know
where I hid his duck.

591
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:16,765
You're still here!
Oh, thank God.

592
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:18,848
Clay Aiken, Santigold
and Aaron Rodgers!

593
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:20,928
You're like my three
favorite people ever!

594
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,889
Excuse me, what is this?

595
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:24,371
Sweetheart,
you're amazing, okay?

596
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:26,044
You're obviously
going to be on the show.

597
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:28,088
So, it's someone
else's turn now.

598
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:29,525
Go ahead. All right?

599
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,240
Um...

600
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:34,891
My name is Ezra Cornell!

601
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:38,885
And I'm just a kindly old
fellow with a song in my heart.

602
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:42,442
No, you're a middle-aged man
with a lot of makeup on.

603
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:44,284
Busted.

604
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:47,569
Got it. Yes, all right, tried to
get your attention with tricks,

605
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:50,246
but you just want to hear me sing.
I respect that.

606
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:53,164
We do not
want to hear you sing.

607
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:55,083
Gabriella was
our last audition.

608
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:56,241
Thank you, goodbye.

609
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:58,243
Nope! Can't end like this.

610
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:02,166
Slept in my car last night, quit
my job, burned all my bridges!

611
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:03,924
I went to the bathroom
on my boss's car,

612
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,924
and I did unspeakable
things with Carla Fern.

613
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,240
Flag on the play.

614
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:12,245
That's what... Yeah. Okay, all right.
Well, here's the song.

615
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:25,966
What is this song?

616
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:27,366
Are you insane?

617
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:29,124
It's the Cornell Fight Song!

618
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:31,931
Listen, all right, thank you very much.
We're not interested.

619
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:33,690
You didn't let me finish!
That's not fair!

620
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:35,444
Look, man, you're
not terrible, but we've

621
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:37,244
heard a lot of
really good singers today,

622
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:38,526
and you're just
not good enough.

623
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:41,331
Wow, you guys
are really mean.

624
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:43,050
I guess that's the show.

625
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:44,451
Let me try
a different song, okay?

626
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:45,601
Can he do this?

627
00:27:58,040 --> 00:27:59,201
Yeah.

628
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:04,882
Look, you've got to go.

629
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:11,570
You can't just
sit here and cry.

630
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:14,405
I can so just
sit here and cry!

631
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:29,925
Thank you.

632
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:34,363
Hey, Kev. How are
you doing, buddy?

633
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:35,885
I can't hear you.

634
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:38,725
I'm giving you
the silence treatment.

635
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:41,602
How does it
feel being ignored?

636
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:46,164
Okay, I guess. It's just that
Phillip got you something.

637
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:49,807
Yeah, a $25
gift card, iTunes.

638
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:51,530
I think there's,
like, $7 left.

639
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:54,128
It's just his way
of saying, "Thanks

640
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:56,203
for letting me hang
out in Accounting."

641
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:57,486
Phillip got this for me?

642
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:58,840
Sure.

643
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:01,811
That was a really cool move.

644
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:04,245
Would you like
to hold Phillip?

645
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:08,568
Yeah, that's Kevin.

646
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:09,971
Hi.

647
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:11,320
- Whoa.
- Easy.

648
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:12,925
What a chubbers.

649
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,291
Whoa...
Okay, hey.

650
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:17,845
I'm losing my balance.

651
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:19,843
Okay, Kevin, no.
No. No horseplay.

652
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:20,967
Stop it.

653
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:22,081
You want to play
with the cactus?

654
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:23,605
No!
No!

655
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:25,842
So me and Phillip
were just talking,

656
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:29,891
and we decided we're going
to be best friends.

657
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:32,967
He's a little
stand-offish at first.

658
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:35,202
But once he starts
buying you things,

659
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:37,482
man,
you can tell he likes you.

660
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,240
We have our decision.

661
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:45,770
You chose one thing.

662
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:48,250
We want to
dance with you.

663
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:50,326
You want to dance?

664
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:52,562
One dance,
all of us together.

665
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:55,760
This is what you want?

666
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:57,330
Yeah.
Absolutely.

667
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:02,325
Better get some decent
speakers up here then,

668
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:03,646
'cause we're going
to do this right.

669
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:06,485
Yes!

670
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:11,729
Hey, you wanted to see me?

671
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:12,881
Door. Chair.

672
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:16,960
It's about Phillip.

673
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:18,525
I'm sorry he's here today,
but I had this...

674
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:20,130
lbeheve

675
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:22,726
that that boy
may be a Schrute,

676
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:24,529
and if he is,

677
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:27,763
that child needs to be
accorded what is his,

678
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:30,565
an enormous farm,
an inheritance,

679
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:34,201
and the right to be raised under
rigorous Schrute traditions.

680
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:39,610
You will, of course, be compensated
with a marriage proposal.

681
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:43,930
How thoughtful.

682
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,401
Then the two of you would
move to my 1,600 acre estate,

683
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:48,164
which let's face it,
is a big step up

684
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:50,049
from living in
a gay man's closet.

685
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:53,441
If he is your son

686
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:56,291
that's a great plan.

687
00:30:57,720 --> 00:31:01,247
But he's not.
He's not your son.

688
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:04,806
Very well.

689
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,605
Can I go back to my desk now?

690
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:08,926
Yes.

691
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:22,251
What's this?

692
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:24,971
Well, I've been trying
to tell you how I feel,

693
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:27,765
and you wouldn't
believe me, so,

694
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:30,760
I needed a little help.

695
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:34,849
Jim. I need my Assistant to the
Regional Manager. Code red.

696
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:37,571
Okay, I don't have my pocket code
chart on me right now, so...

697
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:39,445
Now!

698
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:43,286
I have an assistant now, who can
help you with whatever you need.

699
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:45,044
He is lazy,
so crack the whip.

700
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:47,930
Jim, I'm not kidding,
I need you.

701
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:53,885
Go ahead.

702
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:55,166
Okay. Um...

703
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:57,890
This is...

704
00:31:57,960 --> 00:31:59,689
I'll be right back.

705
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:05,560
What have we got?

706
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:08,211
I was thinking of
proposing to Esther today.

707
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:10,567
Wow! Okay, congratulations.

708
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:11,801
That's a really big step, man.

709
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:13,081
She's got a ton
of great qualities.

710
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:16,801
She's young, she's beautiful, genes
so pure you could lick them.

711
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:20,406
Her family admires me,
and my family tolerates hers.

712
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:23,006
A lot of them are the same people,
because we're third cousins,

713
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:25,885
which is great for bloodlines,
and isn't technically incest.

714
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,287
Right in the sweet spot. I think
you're going to be really happy.

715
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:31,091
Plus, her dowry
contains a walk-in freezer

716
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:33,931
full of frozen
premium cattle sperm.

717
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,650
That's a lot of pros.

718
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:36,961
And did I mention
that she weaves?

719
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:39,771
Colorful, durable blankets and rugs!
It all adds up.

720
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:41,842
So what is the problem?

721
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:47,724
Angela.

722
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:15,521
I don't know what you want
me to tell you, man.

723
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:19,882
All I know is

724
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:23,049
that every time I've been
faced with a tough decision,

725
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:28,329
there's only one thing that
outweighs every other concern,

726
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:30,880
one thing that will
make you give up on

727
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:33,520
everything you
thought you knew.

728
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:39,130
Every instinct,
every rational calculation.

729
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:41,083
Some sort of virus?

730
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:43,043
Love.

731
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:45,006
Oh.

732
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:46,331
I'm in love with you.

733
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:47,961
What?

734
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:06,201
Dwight, listen,
no matter what happens...

735
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:10,523
you've got to forget
about all the other stuff.

736
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:15,606
You've got to forget about
logic and fear and doubt.

737
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:18,206
You've just got to
do everything you can

738
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:22,368
to get to the one woman who's
going to make all this worth it.

739
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:24,124
At the end of the day,

740
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:26,885
you've got to jump.

741
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:32,410
You love Angela, Dwight.

742
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:36,526
I think you always have.

743
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:43,528
You're a good assistant, Jim.

744
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:45,523
Not as good as you.

745
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,450
That's very true.

746
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:51,287
Get the hell out of here.

747
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:52,486
You got it.

748
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:56,563
I was just
checking out my present.

749
00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:01,651
This is an amazing gift, because
it comes with bonus gifts.

750
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:03,290
Look inside.

751
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:12,888
Oh, my God!
The yearbook picture.

752
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:14,450
Yes.
Incredible.

753
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:15,925
Is this the bottle timer?

754
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:17,963
I didn't think you were going to
get that one. I really didn't.

755
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:20,247
Oh, no! This is like
the best present ever.

756
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:22,044
Well...
Okay, wait.

757
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:23,485
What is this?

758
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:25,767
The mini-golf pencil
you threw at me.

759
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:29,003
Like three years ago?
You saved this?

760
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:32,687
Oh, my God.

761
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:41,049
You watched it.

762
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:42,724
Yeah.

763
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:45,491
Well, then I guess
you're ready for this.

764
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:48,446
What's that?

765
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:49,891
It's from the teapot.

766
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:55,641
Everything you'll ever need
to know is in that note.

767
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:13,688
Not enough for me?

768
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:16,764
You are everything.

769
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:25,210
Thank you.

770
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:30,204
Okay, ready, everybody?

771
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:31,327
Hit it, Red!

772
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:50,611
I wanted
to leave quietly.

773
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:52,444
It seemed dignified.

774
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:54,568
But having Kevin
grind up on my front

775
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:56,802
while Erin pretends
to hump me from behind

776
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:59,850
is a more accurate
tribute to my years here.

777
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:02,685
I'm going to miss these guys.

778
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:04,646
Okay, I've got mY...

779
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:06,529
See you guys at Poor Richard's, okay?
All right, Meredith.

780
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:07,601
All right.
Okay, bye.

781
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:08,727
See you there.
Bye, Phillip.

782
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,404
Listen, I...
High five!

783
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:13,050
Yeah.
Yay!

784
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:15,202
I am going to drop
Phillip off at my mother's,

785
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:17,009
and I'll meet you at
Poor Richard's in an hour.

786
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:18,804
You sure you don't
want me to drop him off?

787
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:20,928
She doesn't know I'm living
with a straight woman.

788
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:22,166
I don't want to
get her hopes up.

789
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:23,446
All right.
Okay?

790
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:25,363
Bye, buddy! Bye, bye.

791
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:27,249
Oh, my goodness!

792
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:35,765
Pull over!

793
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:37,205
Dwight!

794
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:39,328
Move to the side
of the road!

795
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:40,606
Why?

796
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:41,921
Pull over!

797
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:44,281
What are you... Dwight!

798
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:50,084
Dwight! What the
is your problem?

799
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:52,128
Silence, woman! Listen to me!
Who drives like that?

800
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:53,167
I love you.

801
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:55,851
And I don't care that
Phillip is not my son!

802
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:58,082
I will raise 100 children

803
00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:01,204
with 100 of your lovers
if it means I can be with you!

804
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:04,211
Can you put that down?

805
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:07,409
This expresses
how loudly I love you!

806
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:08,641
lfstooloud.

807
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:16,929
This is a ring

808
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,480
taken from the buttocks
of my grandmother,

809
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:23,451
put there by the gangster
patriarch of the Coors dynasty,

810
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:26,245
melted in a foundry
run by Mennonites.

811
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:28,482
Okay. Yes. I will!

812
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:35,646
I love you!

813
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:38,607
And I lied to you.

814
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:39,801
What?

815
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:41,725
Phillip's your son.

816
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:43,290
What? Why would
you say that...

817
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:45,727
I just needed you
to want to marry me

818
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:48,241
because you
wanted to marry me.

819
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:52,048
Get out!

820
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:53,963
I'm a dad!
You're a dad!

821
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:02,725
Hey, grab a seat.

822
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:05,451
We have that table and that
table, but not that table,

823
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:07,324
or that table,
or that table.

824
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:10,529
Floor's up for grabs. Meredith's
been hogging the can.

825
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:13,646
Oh!

826
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:17,850
You have to change
the channel to PBS.

827
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:19,410
Yeah.
College baseball's on.

828
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:20,606
Well, there's
a documentary coming up.

829
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:21,881
Everyone in
the bar will love it!

830
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:23,166
What's it about?

831
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:24,486
A paper company.
Oh, ho, ho!

832
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:26,766
How many people
want the game?

833
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:28,205
Yeah!

834
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:30,401
Who wants PBS?

835
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:35,360
Sorry. Tie means
I do nothing.

836
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:36,646
Sir, please!

837
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:39,805
This show is about
me and my attempts

838
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:42,730
to find love in
all the wrong places.

839
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:45,371
One more for the doc!

840
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:49,680
All right, Andy!

841
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:51,364
All right.
Yes.

842
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:53,931
Hey, how was
the singing show audition?

843
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,206
Oh...

844
00:41:55,720 --> 00:41:57,802
Whatever. No big deal.

845
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:01,246
Okay, 30 seconds
to show time!

846
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:06,371
I feel scared a little.
I'm not ready for this!

847
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:08,761
No one is ready for this!
You can't be ready for this!

848
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:10,251
We don't even
know what this is!

849
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:14,120
One thing we do know. Nothing
will ever be the same.

850
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:16,089
Here we go.

851
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:21,809
All right, Jim,
your quarterlies look very good.

852
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:23,325
How are things
going at the library?

853
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:25,243
Oh, I told you.
I couldn't close it, so...

854
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:28,847
So you've come to
the master for guidance?

855
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:30,729
Is this what you're saying,
Grasshopper?

856
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:33,007
Actually you
called me in here.

857
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:35,526
All right, well, let me
show you how it's done.
