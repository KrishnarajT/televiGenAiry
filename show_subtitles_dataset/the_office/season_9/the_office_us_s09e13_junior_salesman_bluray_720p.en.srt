1
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:07,674
Hey, Brian,
you got a sec?

2
00:00:07,750 --> 00:00:10,435
Yeah, I know what you're going
to say, and it's all right.

3
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:13,354
No, I heard... I heard you got in trouble.
I feel awful.

4
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:17,321
It's fine. It was my first slip-up
in nine years of miking you.

5
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:18,915
Dunder Mifflin, this is Erin.

6
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:20,799
Well, thanks
for being a good friend.

7
00:00:20,870 --> 00:00:22,235
Sure, any time.

8
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:23,880
How about you and Jim?
Everything squared away?

9
00:00:23,950 --> 00:00:26,237
Yeah. Mostly.

10
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:28,959
Pam, phone call.

11
00:00:29,590 --> 00:00:30,796
Um.

12
00:00:30,950 --> 00:00:32,076
Hey,
say hi to Alyssa.

13
00:00:32,150 --> 00:00:33,231
Will do.

14
00:00:33,310 --> 00:00:35,233
Okay, thank you.
Sure.

15
00:00:36,550 --> 00:00:38,473
Hey, boom guy.

16
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:39,756
Oh, hey, Meredith.

17
00:00:39,830 --> 00:00:41,195
When are you
going to boom me?

18
00:00:41,270 --> 00:00:43,750
Uh, listen, they're cracking down
on us talking to the subjects.

19
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:46,515
It's a lame rule, but, you know,
I want to... I have to...

20
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:48,752
I'll see you later.
Got it.

21
00:01:20,110 --> 00:01:21,111
Hey-

22
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:22,750
So I hear you're
bringing in some people

23
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:24,241
to interview
for the sales job.

24
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:26,874
That's right,
a couple of old friends.

25
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:30,752
Ballers only,
must be this cool to ride.

26
00:01:30,830 --> 00:01:33,117
Well, see...
You raised it.

27
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:36,191
Oh, did I?
Oh, yes, I did.

28
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:38,472
Wallace is letting me hire
a junior sales associate

29
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:41,030
to sit at Jim's desk
while he's away in Philly.

30
00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:44,353
Finally, I'll have someone at
my desk clump who gets me.

31
00:01:44,470 --> 00:01:47,599
It's like, "Really, Jim? You
don't understand the difference

32
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:50,560
"between a slaughterhouse
and a rendering plant? Uh.

33
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:54,874
"Remind me not to lend you any
dead cows or horses." Wow!

34
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:57,038
You know what, man? I deserve this job.
Mmm-mmm?

35
00:01:57,110 --> 00:01:59,078
I scored Stone & Son
Suit Warehouse with you.

36
00:01:59,150 --> 00:02:01,596
And God knows, to get the
Scranton White Pages with Jan,

37
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:04,873
I went above and beyond,
and under.

38
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:06,880
You know what?

39
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:09,078
You're going to get
your interview. Okay?

40
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:11,357
I know that you're going head-to-head
against some real superstars,

41
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:13,438
but you've got
a really good chance.

42
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:15,592
Clark has no chance.

43
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:17,991
I mean he's up against
my buddy Rolf, for God's sake!

44
00:02:18,070 --> 00:02:20,914
The guy goes fishing with hand grenades.
And Trevor?

45
00:02:20,990 --> 00:02:23,641
He'll make you laugh so hard
you'll puke your pants.

46
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:24,916
This sucks.
You know?

47
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:27,596
You put in 12 grueling weeks at
a company and what do they do?

48
00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:30,833
They make you compete for a promotion.
Like an animal!

49
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:34,437
You know, I thought this was an
office, not the Thunderdome.

50
00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:36,638
Big changes coming
to the old desk clump.

51
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:39,839
Nolonger a Pam-Jim
alliance against Dwight.

52
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:43,631
Now it is Dwight-and-a-friend
axis against Pam.

53
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:45,719
You could have just called
that an alliance, too, right?

54
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:48,191
I chose my words
very carefully.

55
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:52,034
Things are a little delicate
with me and Pam right now,

56
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:53,760
and if my working
in Philly is going

57
00:02:53,830 --> 00:02:55,798
to end up doubling
the Dwight in her life,

58
00:02:55,870 --> 00:02:57,952
that's only going
to make things worse.

59
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:04,954
You interviewing for
the sales job, too?

60
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:08,318
No, you're interviewing
for it. I'm getting it.

61
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:09,801
Well, I wouldn't be
so sure about that.

62
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:11,315
I mean, I've been
working here 12 weeks.

63
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:13,154
That's a full season
of Homeland.

64
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:16,234
A ton of things can happen in that
amount of time, as we've seen.

65
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:18,996
I'm Rolf. Rolf Aul.

66
00:03:19,070 --> 00:03:20,993
Rolf Aul.

67
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:22,481
Sounds kind
of like Roald Dahl.

68
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:23,676
Go to hell.

69
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:25,151
There he is!

70
00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:26,311
Hey!

71
00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:27,437
Come on, buddy,
let's do this.

72
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:28,995
Sorry,
Rolf goes first.

73
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:31,994
You don't compare.
When you're with the R-O-L-F,

74
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:35,358
you're literally
rolling on the laughing floor!

75
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:37,001
Nice!

76
00:03:37,070 --> 00:03:41,598
Rolf is my best friend,
and he is the man!

77
00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:44,355
Cool, calm and collected, 24/7.

78
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:46,910
Just try and rattle Rolf.
I dare you.

79
00:03:47,390 --> 00:03:48,835
Such a sweet guy.

80
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:50,400
When are you
talking to David Wallace?

81
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:52,598
I'm talking to him this afternoon,
but don't get your hopes up.

82
00:03:52,670 --> 00:03:54,081
Too late.
My hopes are up.

83
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:56,357
Last week, my company in
Philly lost a big investor,

84
00:03:56,430 --> 00:03:58,512
so we're scrambling
to find new funding.

85
00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:00,797
LuckHy,
my partners have a fix,

86
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:03,720
me asking the boss of the
company I'm abandoning

87
00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:06,640
to give us a gigantic
influx of cash.

88
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:10,311
So, problem solved.
Thanks, guys.

89
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:13,396
This chair's going to be yours!
And this desk!

90
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:15,040
I'm on the phone.
I'm on the phone.

91
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:16,516
No doy!

92
00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:18,555
I'm just going to call you back.
Thanks.

93
00:04:20,990 --> 00:04:24,881
I hope you like Norwegian black
metal, because I don't do ear buds.

94
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:26,031
Ho-ho!

95
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:27,760
No ear buds!

96
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:31,956
I'm sure
he's just nervous.

97
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:37,036
It's fine. It's just a seating arrangement.
It doesn't matter.

98
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:44,070
So, I've got your resume here, but
it's not telling me everything.

99
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:45,720
A lot of that
information is private.

100
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:48,037
How do I know you're
qualified to evaluate me?

101
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:49,600
I'm the one
offering the job.

102
00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:50,916
What are your credentials?

103
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:52,560
I've worked
here for 12 years.

104
00:04:52,670 --> 00:04:55,150
I've won Salesman of the Year, I'm an
assistant to the regional manager.

105
00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:56,391
I think I've heard
everything I need to hear.

106
00:04:56,510 --> 00:04:59,320
Wait, wait. No, if you need to know
more, you can call David Wallace.

107
00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:00,437
I'm sure
he'd give a reference.

108
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:02,831
Thank you, Dwight.
lWlbeintouch.

109
00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:07,391
Well, they can't
all be winners.

110
00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:09,871
But Trevor's next,
and he's a real professional.

111
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:13,272
You say "jump,"
and he says "on who?"

112
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:15,876
He loves to jump on people,
that Trevor.

113
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:19,673
What makes you think you'd be
an effective paper salesman?

114
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:23,272
Oh, okay. Didn't see
that one coming.

115
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:27,194
Can I take a 20 on that, maybe
we can circle back around to it?

116
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:28,874
Well, it's a pretty
basic question

117
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:30,520
for a potential
paper salesman.

118
00:05:30,590 --> 00:05:32,479
Pass. Next one.

119
00:05:32,910 --> 00:05:35,038
All right.
Do you see yourself as

120
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:37,431
more of a team player
or a self-starter?

121
00:05:37,590 --> 00:05:39,991
No, no and no.

122
00:05:41,470 --> 00:05:42,881
There were only two options.

123
00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:45,279
Check mate.

124
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:47,552
You win this one,
my friend.

125
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:50,040
Do you validate parking?

126
00:05:51,470 --> 00:05:53,040
This is a bus transfer.

127
00:05:54,510 --> 00:05:56,000
Nothing gets by this guy.

128
00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:00,231
Hey, Jim?

129
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:02,438
Do you mind if I look over these
price sheets before my interview?

130
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:03,716
Sure, yeah. Go ahead.

131
00:06:03,790 --> 00:06:05,076
Thanks, dude.

132
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:12,319
You... You sure it's okay?
'Cause you're kind of...

133
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:15,917
Yeah. Absolutely. Do people
like sitting next to you?

134
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:17,037
You're clean, right?

135
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:18,920
Dove Men.
Nice.

136
00:06:18,990 --> 00:06:20,958
Music, do you
listen to it in ear buds?

137
00:06:22,630 --> 00:06:24,598
You don't listen to it at all.
Because we're at work,

138
00:06:24,670 --> 00:06:26,479
not a Florence and
The Machine concert, so...

139
00:06:26,910 --> 00:06:30,153
Yeah. Could I just have a
minute to prepare for this?

140
00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:32,876
Sure, yeah.
Do whatever you need to do,

141
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:35,078
right after you do
one thing for me.

142
00:06:36,670 --> 00:06:37,910
I need you to
breathe in my face.

143
00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:39,196
Why?

144
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:41,921
I need you to breathe
in my face right now.

145
00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:46,199
What are we working with,
peppermint or Wintergreen?

146
00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:47,351
Wintergreen.
I knew it.

147
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:48,431
Yeah.
I knew it.

148
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:50,190
Good nose! I looked
at you coming around,

149
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:51,874
and I said "Wintergreen."

150
00:06:51,950 --> 00:06:53,156
I can't hire Clark.

151
00:06:53,230 --> 00:06:56,518
Yeah, he looks like a Schrute,
but he thinks like a Halpert,

152
00:06:56,630 --> 00:06:59,110
and he acts like a Beesly.

153
00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:00,801
Okay, here's one.

154
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:02,201
A customer who
ordered enough paper

155
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:03,556
to qualify
for a volume discount

156
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:05,473
now wants
to return half the stock.

157
00:07:05,590 --> 00:07:07,399
You can't rebate
the sales price

158
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:09,837
or credit for
future purchases,

159
00:07:09,910 --> 00:07:13,278
because you brokered
the deal for a third party.

160
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:15,000
That's just a classic
no-win situation.

161
00:07:15,070 --> 00:07:16,071
Thank you.

162
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:17,316
So, I'd Kobayashi Maru it.

163
00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:20,519
Damn it!
Perfect answer, again!

164
00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:22,315
Yep.
Okay, think, Dwight, think.

165
00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:25,511
You have a ream of 16 bond and...
You know what, Dwight?

166
00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:28,918
This interview is over
and I get the job.

167
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:31,152
I just Kobayashi Maru'd
the whole process.

168
00:07:32,270 --> 00:07:33,635
No.
Yeah.

169
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:34,831
Star Trek rules.

170
00:07:35,110 --> 00:07:36,919
Itdoes, butsflH, no.

171
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:40,358
Come on, man. Did Trevor do that?
Did Rolf do that?

172
00:07:40,470 --> 00:07:42,234
Oh, you think they're
my only friends?

173
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:44,039
I've got way more
friends than that.

174
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:46,238
And they're all better
than the losers who work here.

175
00:07:54,190 --> 00:07:57,637
This is not natural.

176
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:04,114
I just don't want
to make assumptions

177
00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:05,840
based on people's
physical appearances.

178
00:08:05,910 --> 00:08:08,595
Of course not. But does physical
appearance include smell?

179
00:08:08,670 --> 00:08:10,320
They smell so bad.

180
00:08:10,470 --> 00:08:12,996
If I ever get that bad,
you'd tell me, right?

181
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:14,720
Meredith,
I tell you all the time.

182
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:17,118
Walked right into that one!

183
00:08:18,710 --> 00:08:20,439
Next up,
my cousin Mose.

184
00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:22,638
Mose could make
a great paper salesman.

185
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:24,838
He's got a natural fear of
paper, which would motivate him

186
00:08:24,910 --> 00:08:27,277
to get as much of it out
of this office as possible.

187
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:29,830
I've got big expectations,
Mose-wise.

188
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:32,641
What quality would make you
a good sales associate?

189
00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:34,156
People person.

190
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:37,234
It says here on your resume that
you spent the last 15 years

191
00:08:37,310 --> 00:08:39,312
as a sales rep
for Dow Chemical.

192
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:40,471
That's right.

193
00:08:40,550 --> 00:08:41,790
You know we live
together, right?

194
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:42,951
Yes.

195
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:45,510
And I've never seen
you go to work ever.

196
00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:47,271
Okay-

197
00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:48,715
So why is this
on your resume?

198
00:09:14,110 --> 00:09:16,078
So, how'd you guys
hear about the position?

199
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:18,995
My mom.
Dwight called my house,

200
00:09:19,070 --> 00:09:21,641
but he didn't realize
that I had already moved out.

201
00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:23,599
Because my mom
and I are quarreling,

202
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:26,276
because I can't
stay out of her stuff.

203
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:27,791
Dwight's my cousin.

204
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:29,759
So I overheard him
telling my brother Mose

205
00:09:29,830 --> 00:09:31,912
about the job opportunity
in the shower.

206
00:09:31,990 --> 00:09:33,913
You were in the shower?
Or he was in the shower?

207
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:35,355
Everyone was in the shower.

208
00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:39,230
It's a cow shower. So there's
like a ton of people in there.

209
00:09:39,310 --> 00:09:40,755
So you guys all
know Dwight already?

210
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:44,551
I was his babysitter,
and then we dated for a while.

211
00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:48,755
He was a passionate lover and the
sweetest little baby.

212
00:09:48,830 --> 00:09:50,753
I knew you
looked familiar.

213
00:09:50,830 --> 00:09:52,355
You used to pick up
Dwight from school.

214
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:54,871
You went
to X-Men school, too?

215
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:57,835
X-Men school?

216
00:09:57,910 --> 00:10:01,073
When I was young, I spent several
years at a private school

217
00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:02,675
where I was told
I would be taught

218
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:04,479
to harness
my mutant abilities.

219
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:06,757
Turned out it was
a conman copying

220
00:10:06,830 --> 00:10:09,356
Charles Xavier's School
for Gifted Youngsters,

221
00:10:09,430 --> 00:10:11,000
from the X-Men comic books.

222
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:14,751
It took me years to figure
out that it was a con.

223
00:10:14,830 --> 00:10:16,958
Some people
never figured it out.

224
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:20,000
Oh, I have a few powers.
Night hearing!

225
00:10:20,070 --> 00:10:22,152
Dogs understand
where I point.

226
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:24,232
And our training
included picking carrots,

227
00:10:24,310 --> 00:10:27,951
scrubbing tubs,
sewing imitation Levi's,

228
00:10:28,030 --> 00:10:29,475
a lot of telemarketing.

229
00:10:30,990 --> 00:10:34,437
I don't want to sit near any of
those people for the next 20 years.

230
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:35,750
Someone say something.

231
00:10:35,830 --> 00:10:37,195
I said something
when they were thinking

232
00:10:37,270 --> 00:10:39,352
of hiring Jim,
didn't work then.

233
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:41,398
Now look what
he's doing to us.

234
00:10:41,510 --> 00:10:43,274
Yeah, Jim,
this is all your fault.

235
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:44,317
How is it my fault?

236
00:10:44,390 --> 00:10:46,154
Here's
an exercise for you, Jim.

237
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:49,234
Imagine there are
consequences to your actions.

238
00:10:49,310 --> 00:10:53,110
Hmm. Imagine the whole world
does not revolve around this.

239
00:10:53,390 --> 00:10:54,755
There are others.

240
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:57,271
But it's Dwight who's
bringing in all the weirdoes.

241
00:10:57,350 --> 00:10:58,954
Yeah, but, Jim,
Dwight's a weirdo.

242
00:10:59,030 --> 00:11:01,078
We can't blame a weirdo
for bringing in weirdoes.

243
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:03,832
We can blame a normal
for creating a situation

244
00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:06,072
where a weirdo is allowed
to bring in weirdoes.

245
00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:08,391
Hey, I'm the one who has
to sit next to this weirdo

246
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:09,995
when Jim's away.

247
00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:11,834
I'm in a position
where I'm rooting for Nate,

248
00:11:11,990 --> 00:11:14,357
and that
just feels wrong.

249
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:19,236
Forget it.
I need to work on my mural.

250
00:11:20,070 --> 00:11:22,835
I have some pointy trees
that I need to round off.

251
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:33,111
Hey, Jim, I thought
our call was for later.

252
00:11:33,190 --> 00:11:35,511
Yeah, this is actually
about the new sales guy.

253
00:11:35,590 --> 00:11:38,400
Uh, Dwight has brought in
a bunch of real weirdoes,

254
00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:40,393
and I was wondering if I could
have some input into...

255
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:42,154
This is Dwight Schrute.
Who am I speaking to?

256
00:11:42,230 --> 00:11:43,755
And don't lie,
I can tell if you're lying.

257
00:11:43,830 --> 00:11:45,400
Hey, Dwight, it's David.
David!

258
00:11:45,470 --> 00:11:48,076
Jim says he'd like some say
in the hiring process.

259
00:11:49,310 --> 00:11:51,312
Really?
That's interesting,

260
00:11:51,390 --> 00:11:54,553
'cause I was thinking that since
Jim is only here part-time,

261
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:57,156
he might not be as invested
in the decision-making process

262
00:11:57,230 --> 00:11:58,880
as someone like me,
who's here every day

263
00:11:58,950 --> 00:12:00,600
and, frankly,
killing it lately.

264
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:01,956
I was just
thinking that, because

265
00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:03,714
this person is going
to be sitting at my desk,

266
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:04,837
near my wife...

267
00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:05,991
Jim, another thing.

268
00:12:06,070 --> 00:12:07,720
Since we are
going to have to hire

269
00:12:07,790 --> 00:12:09,679
this junior sales
associate to cover for you,

270
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:11,354
I'm going to
have to pay you only

271
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:13,194
for the days that
you actually work.

272
00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:16,071
Oh, um.

273
00:12:16,150 --> 00:12:17,276
Yeah.

274
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:20,196
Okay. I can't say
that that's not fair.

275
00:12:20,270 --> 00:12:21,351
It sounds fair to me, David.

276
00:12:21,430 --> 00:12:23,114
Now, I know we have
a call scheduled for later.

277
00:12:23,190 --> 00:12:24,601
Oh, yeah. So we'll
just do that later.

278
00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:26,041
No, why not do it now?

279
00:12:26,110 --> 00:12:27,475
Yeah, what's up, Jim?

280
00:12:28,510 --> 00:12:29,955
Uh...

281
00:12:30,030 --> 00:12:31,441
Well, it's aboutAthlead.

282
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:34,752
I'm sorry. Does Dwight have to be
on this part of the phone call?

283
00:12:34,830 --> 00:12:36,355
I'd love to be
in the loop, David.

284
00:12:36,430 --> 00:12:37,556
It's okay.
Go ahead, Jim.

285
00:12:39,470 --> 00:12:42,280
There's a very exciting opportunity
to be a core investor...

286
00:12:42,390 --> 00:12:44,916
Okay, Jim, I'm going to have
to stop you right there.

287
00:12:44,990 --> 00:12:46,640
Yes, okay. Bye.

288
00:12:50,710 --> 00:12:52,917
I'd love to invest.
No, thanks.

289
00:12:52,990 --> 00:12:55,277
I'd like to give you
$100 million.

290
00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:06,840
Why you make
trees into bushes?

291
00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:09,356
You don't make
paper from bushes.

292
00:13:09,430 --> 00:13:11,558
Hide, they're
giving outjobs upstairs.

293
00:13:11,670 --> 00:13:13,320
Why don't you 9Q
UP and get one?

294
00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:15,231
Thank you.

295
00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:17,116
Yeah.

296
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:25,160
VVhOOps!

297
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:35,193
It's dense.
Like bread.

298
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:43,396
Dwight, you can't just hire someone
because they're your friend.

299
00:13:43,510 --> 00:13:45,751
I'm not. These people are
the best of the best.

300
00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:48,271
I find talent an attractive
quality in a friend.

301
00:13:48,350 --> 00:13:49,636
They're freaks, Dwight.

302
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:52,230
All your friends
are weirdoes and freaks.

303
00:13:52,550 --> 00:13:54,279
You know
who else was a freak?

304
00:13:54,350 --> 00:13:57,160
Spider-Man.
And he was also a hero.

305
00:13:57,430 --> 00:13:58,955
Your friends are
like Spider-Man,

306
00:13:59,030 --> 00:14:00,998
if he had gotten
bitten by a spider

307
00:14:01,070 --> 00:14:03,357
and then got really
into masturbating.

308
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:06,672
Man, how cool is it going to
be when I start working here?

309
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:08,036
Paintball fights at lunch!

310
00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:09,794
Ooh!
Mandatory paintball.

311
00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:11,360
Uh, Wolf, please report
to the parking lot

312
00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:13,000
for mandatory
paintball at lunch.

313
00:14:13,070 --> 00:14:15,038
Wolf is hilarious.
He's executed me

314
00:14:15,150 --> 00:14:17,278
over 100 times
at point blank range.

315
00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:19,318
Half of them,
we were on the same team.

316
00:14:19,390 --> 00:14:21,996
Oh, my God,
how I screamed.

317
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:23,231
Ah, that goof.

318
00:14:23,510 --> 00:14:25,717
Sell me
this piece of paper.

319
00:14:26,910 --> 00:14:27,957
Watch this.

320
00:14:28,070 --> 00:14:30,152
Do you want this paper?
I sure do.

321
00:14:30,230 --> 00:14:31,994
It's not very good.

322
00:14:32,070 --> 00:14:33,754
I will pay you
whatever it takes.

323
00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:35,201
I think
I want to keep it now.

324
00:14:35,270 --> 00:14:37,432
It must be pretty special
if you want it so bad.

325
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:39,751
No, you have lots of other pieces
of paper that are just like it.

326
00:14:39,830 --> 00:14:40,831
So here,
just take my money.

327
00:14:40,910 --> 00:14:43,754
Stop trying to get my paper, buddy!
Okay? Read my lips, it's over.

328
00:14:43,870 --> 00:14:46,840
Okay. Good.
That was great. So...

329
00:14:47,910 --> 00:14:49,639
Wow. You're still at
the 570 number?

330
00:14:49,830 --> 00:14:51,275
I am.
Okay.

331
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:52,920
Good, good, good.

332
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:57,993
I have eight years
experience selling

333
00:14:58,110 --> 00:15:01,478
electronics in Sanyo store,
downtown Tokyo.

334
00:15:01,590 --> 00:15:03,035
I was a doctor,

335
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:07,195
and I have a business degree
from Tokyo University.

336
00:15:08,630 --> 00:15:10,917
This isn't
going to work out.

337
00:15:13,110 --> 00:15:14,350
Thank you!

338
00:15:18,910 --> 00:15:20,719
Nate is a proven entity,

339
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:24,511
but not without his handicaps,
hearing, vision, basic cognition.

340
00:15:25,070 --> 00:15:27,721
Trevor is great, but I saw
no fire in him today,

341
00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:30,077
and this is a guy
who loves to start fires.

342
00:15:30,150 --> 00:15:32,551
Troy is
literally one of a kind.

343
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:36,999
He's a goblin or a hobbit or a
kobold, which is a type of gremlin.

344
00:15:37,150 --> 00:15:39,198
And yet I'm hesitant.

345
00:15:39,270 --> 00:15:41,796
Why can't I pull
the trigger on any of them?

346
00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:44,595
No, no, no.

347
00:15:45,870 --> 00:15:49,716
I just need to tell them.

348
00:15:52,830 --> 00:15:54,241
Do you need to be changed?

349
00:15:54,830 --> 00:15:56,719
I do that myself now.
Hmm.

350
00:15:57,670 --> 00:15:59,638
Are you going to
make a decision soon?

351
00:15:59,710 --> 00:16:01,474
I've been double-parked
for five hours.

352
00:16:01,590 --> 00:16:03,354
I'm wondering
if I should move my car.

353
00:16:03,710 --> 00:16:05,235
No, you've been
towed by now.

354
00:16:05,310 --> 00:16:07,756
They tow after
about 45 minutes.

355
00:16:07,830 --> 00:16:11,232
Well, the joke's on them. I live
right next to the tow yard.

356
00:16:11,350 --> 00:16:13,830
All they did was
save me some gas.

357
00:16:14,670 --> 00:16:16,752
Hey, man. We get
how difficult this is,

358
00:16:16,830 --> 00:16:19,436
and no matter who you choose, we're
still going to be your friend.

359
00:16:19,510 --> 00:16:22,798
Yeah, whether it's me, or Troy
Underbridge, or Gabor, or Melvina...

360
00:16:22,870 --> 00:16:24,360
- Or none of you.
- Yeah.

361
00:16:24,430 --> 00:16:26,239
You'd bring us all down here,
put us through the ringer,

362
00:16:26,310 --> 00:16:27,311
and then choose none of us.

363
00:16:27,390 --> 00:16:29,358
Can you imagine how
insulting that would be?

364
00:16:29,470 --> 00:16:32,713
The contempt that a person like
that would have to have for you.

365
00:16:33,630 --> 00:16:35,439
I wish I could
hire all of you.

366
00:16:35,790 --> 00:16:37,201
I could start Monday.

367
00:16:41,030 --> 00:16:42,361
Psst. Jim.

368
00:16:44,150 --> 00:16:45,231
Jim.

369
00:16:46,830 --> 00:16:48,514
Jim, turn around.

370
00:16:49,030 --> 00:16:51,317
Jim, turn around.
Jim, turn around. Jim.

371
00:16:51,430 --> 00:16:54,081
Oh! I love staring off
in one direction.

372
00:16:54,150 --> 00:16:58,121
If I'm not looking south, I'm not living.
That's what I always say.

373
00:17:00,390 --> 00:17:01,391
Just act natural.

374
00:17:09,710 --> 00:17:12,111
And I was
thinking it's only fair

375
00:17:12,190 --> 00:17:13,396
that you help
make this decision,

376
00:17:13,470 --> 00:17:16,952
since they'll be sitting at
your desk next to your wife.

377
00:17:17,030 --> 00:17:18,873
But you know I wouldn't hire
any of these all-stars.

378
00:17:20,710 --> 00:17:22,917
God, that sucks!

379
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:25,712
What are you going to do?
I mean, it's your call.

380
00:17:25,790 --> 00:17:28,680
No. Your friends not turning out
to be as great as you thought?

381
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:29,876
Not even Gabor?

382
00:17:30,070 --> 00:17:31,595
I guess I just
have higher standards

383
00:17:31,670 --> 00:17:33,991
for my work colleagues than
for my friends.

384
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:37,040
I just couldn't picture any of
them in the old gold and gray.

385
00:17:37,110 --> 00:17:39,954
I knew it. You designed
a uniform for Dunder Mifflin.

386
00:17:40,150 --> 00:17:44,280
Summer. Winter. Jungle.

387
00:17:45,710 --> 00:17:46,996
Formal.

388
00:17:47,110 --> 00:17:50,353
Well, I, for one, was amazed
at how qualified everyone was.

389
00:17:50,430 --> 00:17:52,353
You? Amazed.
Yes. Thank you. Yes.

390
00:17:52,430 --> 00:17:54,353
And I got to say,
this was a tough decision,

391
00:17:54,430 --> 00:17:57,320
and we had to go
with none of you.

392
00:17:58,190 --> 00:17:59,430
I'm sorry?
What?

393
00:18:00,230 --> 00:18:02,961
This is such bull crap!

394
00:18:03,030 --> 00:18:05,681
Well, you know, Wallace put me in charge.
So you have no say.

395
00:18:05,910 --> 00:18:10,154
Wow. So much crap.
It's just a load of BC!

396
00:18:10,630 --> 00:18:12,519
How could you
do this to them?

397
00:18:12,590 --> 00:18:14,035
Too much now.
Okay.

398
00:18:14,110 --> 00:18:17,000
Do we get our resumes back?
Or do you keep them?

399
00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:18,560
Because
I only have the one,

400
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:22,715
and I have a chili recipe on the
back that I really want to keep.

401
00:18:22,830 --> 00:18:24,912
Okay,
this is an outrage.

402
00:18:24,990 --> 00:18:25,991
Oh!

403
00:18:26,390 --> 00:18:28,552
You know what? This is Jim
Halpert's home address

404
00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:31,110
in case you guys want to toilet
paper his house or whatever.

405
00:18:31,190 --> 00:18:32,954
That seems inconsiderate.

406
00:18:33,230 --> 00:18:35,551
No. We get it.

407
00:18:35,630 --> 00:18:38,076
Thanks so much for the
opportunity, Dwight.

408
00:18:38,270 --> 00:18:41,080
Don't open any suspicious
packages you may receive.

409
00:18:41,150 --> 00:18:44,313
No wait, do open them.
Totally safe.

410
00:18:45,310 --> 00:18:47,836
Guys! It wasn't up to me.
Rolf, come on!

411
00:18:47,910 --> 00:18:51,119
Guys, it wasn't my choice.
I would have hired all of you!

412
00:18:51,190 --> 00:18:52,760
Gabor? Gabor?

413
00:18:52,830 --> 00:18:54,320
Well, my day's shot.

414
00:18:54,430 --> 00:18:56,751
Yeah. It's that weird hour where
it's too late to start a slow roast,

415
00:18:56,830 --> 00:18:58,036
and too early
for a Swanson's.

416
00:18:58,150 --> 00:19:00,152
I got it.
Paintball!

417
00:19:00,310 --> 00:19:02,551
Oh, that sounds awesome. Can
we wait till I get off work?

418
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:04,832
And what are we
supposed to do until then?

419
00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:06,639
Okay. WOLF: Let's
just go, you guys.

420
00:19:06,710 --> 00:19:08,439
Yeah, no limit on
weapons class, right?

421
00:19:15,390 --> 00:19:17,757
All right.
I think that went well.

422
00:19:21,430 --> 00:19:23,273
So, if you just take a
look at this... Yeah.

423
00:19:23,350 --> 00:19:24,351
That'll print the...

424
00:19:24,470 --> 00:19:26,393
Hey, hey,
meet your new desk mate.

425
00:19:26,470 --> 00:19:27,801
What's up, good-looking?

426
00:19:28,030 --> 00:19:29,714
Oh, cool.
Hey, Clark.

427
00:19:30,030 --> 00:19:32,032
Trust me, this is the
least of all the evils.

428
00:19:32,430 --> 00:19:33,795
It took me all day
to pull this off.

429
00:19:33,870 --> 00:19:35,554
So you should be thrilled,
considering...

430
00:19:35,830 --> 00:19:37,320
Yeah, I guess.

431
00:19:37,430 --> 00:19:40,081
I mean, I kind of liked
my old desk mate.

432
00:19:40,350 --> 00:19:41,556
Okay-

433
00:19:42,110 --> 00:19:43,555
I'm really sorry,
I told the guys

434
00:19:43,630 --> 00:19:45,155
I'd be there for
the board meeting.

435
00:19:45,270 --> 00:19:46,237
Of course.

436
00:19:46,350 --> 00:19:48,159
I'll call you when I get there.
All right.

437
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:49,311
Bye.
All right.

438
00:19:49,390 --> 00:19:50,391
Take care of my wife.
I will be back.

439
00:20:00,630 --> 00:20:02,041
They say that
everyone outgrows

440
00:20:02,110 --> 00:20:03,999
their friends at some
point in their lives.

441
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:08,075
Well, I just outgrew them all
in the span of three hours.

442
00:20:09,430 --> 00:20:11,353
Hey, Pam, I'm going to the
kitchen, you want anything?

443
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:12,836
I'm good.

444
00:20:12,910 --> 00:20:14,241
Oh, hey,
I'll take a coffee.

445
00:20:14,390 --> 00:20:17,758
Oh, I'm sorry. You got to
be this cool for coffee.

446
00:20:27,710 --> 00:20:29,280
Hey, Dwight.

447
00:20:29,350 --> 00:20:30,590
Want to haze the new guy?

448
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:32,797
Who? Me?

449
00:20:33,430 --> 00:20:34,477
Us.

450
00:20:35,590 --> 00:20:37,115
Absolutely I do.

451
00:20:38,030 --> 00:20:41,671
Okay, okay, here.

452
00:20:42,870 --> 00:20:45,237
So the next time
he goes to the bathroom,

453
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:46,960
I'll distract him,
you take that.

454
00:20:47,030 --> 00:20:48,361
Okay. Yeah.
I know what to do.

455
00:20:48,430 --> 00:20:49,431
Okay-

456
00:20:49,510 --> 00:20:50,557
Oh, that's great!

457
00:20:58,950 --> 00:21:00,554
Welcome to the club, pig!

458
00:21:01,390 --> 00:21:02,755
No! Dwight!

459
00:21:05,310 --> 00:21:08,792
No, it does matter who ends up
sitting next to Pam when I'm gone.

460
00:21:08,870 --> 00:21:10,440
The people around
you are basically

461
00:21:10,510 --> 00:21:12,478
who you end up
spending your life with.

462
00:21:12,630 --> 00:21:14,473
I mean, because of
where my desk was,

463
00:21:14,550 --> 00:21:17,679
I spent all those years looking
at Pam, and I fell in love.

464
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:20,196
So, that stuff matters.

465
00:21:20,270 --> 00:21:22,159
It definitely does.
