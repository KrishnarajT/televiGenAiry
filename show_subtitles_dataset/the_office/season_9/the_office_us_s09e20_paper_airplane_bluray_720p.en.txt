1
00:00:05,260 --> 00:00:06,750
Oh. Hey, champions.

2
00:00:06,820 --> 00:00:08,026
Good morning.

3
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:10,626
Quarter finals in an hour,
hope you got some sleep,

4
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:12,941
because I'm going to be haunting
your nightmares tonight.

5
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:15,268
I did. I got some
really good sleep.

6
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:16,341
Did you?

7
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:18,147
Zzz...

8
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:24,023
Yesterday was the first round of a
branch-wide paper airplane contest.

9
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:26,268
It was being sponsored
by WeyerHammer Paper

10
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:28,911
in an effort to get us to sell
more of their new product,

11
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:32,985
Airstream Deluxe A4,
the Cadillac of paper.

12
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:37,342
It's not so easy on the environment,
if you know what I mean.

13
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:39,866
It's practically
made of plastic.

14
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:42,182
We started with
16 brave aviators.

15
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:45,226
Some used skill.

16
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:47,862
Others relied on showmanship.

17
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:50,146
Others seemed
not to comprehend

18
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:51,710
- what a paper airplane is.
- Oh!

19
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:55,623
And of course there was the odd
moment of heartbreak and disaster.

20
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:57,702
I think I left my glasses
down here somewhere.

21
00:00:57,820 --> 00:00:59,470
Crossing through.
Beep, beep.

22
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:00,901
Ow! Ow!

23
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:04,347
I didn't see you! You should
have yelling "crossing!"

24
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:05,751
I'm sorry.

25
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:10,307
Okay, so is that my spot?

26
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:12,826
We are now down
to an elite eight.

27
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:16,064
Well, seven, and Toby.

28
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:28,831
"Be careful of that beaker.
It contains dangerous acid!"

29
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:32,064
it does not say "dangerous" and
there's no exclamation point.

30
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:35,303
Well, I'm just... I'm trying
to bring some life to it.

31
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:39,346
Last week I got an agent, and
uh, this week I got a movie.

32
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:42,028
HRPDC Chemical
Handling Protocols.

33
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:44,108
It's going to be seen
by tons of workers

34
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:46,228
in the industrial
chemical community,

35
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:47,825
one of whom
could have a cousin

36
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:51,268
whose brother is Brad Pitt,
and then boom!

37
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:54,384
Next thing you know,
I'm in Moneyballs 2.

38
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:57,588
Andy? Go away! We're
running lines.

39
00:01:58,020 --> 00:01:59,590
You wanted to
see the gooey eye.

40
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:01,982
Oh, yeah.
All right, get over here.

41
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:07,901
I'm so freaked out by things
going into eyes. Ltjust... Wow.

42
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:14,263
Oh, ugh!

43
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:17,304
I can't even... I'm so freaked
out by that. Just go.

44
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:19,343
Go, go, go. All right.
It's getting gooier.

45
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:21,263
So, we'll just do it later.
Okay.

46
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:24,270
All right, where were we?

47
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:25,941
We stopped
at "full of acid."

48
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:30,181
"And remember, do not attempt to
extinguish a chemical fire with water.

49
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:33,787
"It will only exacerbate the flame.
The dangerous flame."

50
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:37,062
That was great, man.
All right, I'm out of here.

51
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:39,347
Wait, wait, wait, wait. Stop, stop, stop.
Don't go anywhere.

52
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:41,787
I just need to
find more colors.

53
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:43,547
Let's do it
six more times.

54
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:50,626
Hey, I just wanted to say that
you woke up early with the kids

55
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:51,826
and let me sleep.

56
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:54,665
And I really appreciate that.

57
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:56,151
Thank you.

58
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:58,827
I appreciate that
you appreciate that.

59
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:01,261
So, we had
couples therapy.

60
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:03,468
No shame in that. Get
it all out in the open.

61
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:04,951
And we have homework.
Yes.

62
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:06,590
We are supposed to
look for every chance

63
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:10,107
to acknowledge and appreciate
each other's sacrifices.

64
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:13,662
Because I need to appreciate what
Pam's been doing to run the house

65
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:14,821
While I'm in Philly.

66
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:17,460
And we are also supposed to
speak our truths. Mmm-hmm.

67
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:19,941
Becauseiflhad
spoken my truth earlier

68
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:22,022
about not wanting
to move to Philly,

69
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:23,465
then maybe we
wouldn't have had

70
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:25,383
this opportunity
for couples therapy.

71
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:26,700
Oh, we're supposed
to call everything

72
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:28,987
we don't want to
do "opportunities."

73
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:30,860
Heads up, everyone!

74
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:35,264
If you really need something from me
today, let's get it done tomorrow.

75
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:37,025
Carla Fern got me a gig.

76
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:38,591
Hey.
Yeah.

77
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:39,786
Who's Carla Fern?

78
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:42,591
Who is Carla Fern?
Well...

79
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:43,981
Wow.

80
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:46,870
Uh, she's my agent
and my drill sergeant.

81
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:48,544
And one
of my best friends.

82
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:50,988
Oh, and, Oscar,
I already figured out

83
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:52,625
if I have to get
emotional in the film,

84
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:54,543
I'm just gonna think about you
getting dumped by the Senator.

85
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:57,301
Why don't you use your own life?
Erin just dumped you.

86
00:03:57,980 --> 00:04:00,631
It's a little raw.
Not cool, Oscar.

87
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:01,986
But you just...
Not cool.

88
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:04,222
Okay. Day two.

89
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:06,747
Drama in
the warehouse skies.

90
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:09,790
This is Robert
from WeyerHammer Paper

91
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:12,666
who will be joining us
to judge the final rounds.

92
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:14,230
Who's pumped for
the quarterfinals, huh?

93
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:15,540
I'm pumped.

94
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:17,509
- Clark's a dead man.
- All right.

95
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:20,026
Sounds like somebody wants
to walk away with this.

96
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:21,829
- Oh, my God.
- Wow.

97
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:25,388
Nellie, you didn't tell
us we could win money.

98
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:28,782
Oh, yes, I did.
I told you all.

99
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:33,149
It was, um... 'Cause that's an awful
lot of money for me to forget.

100
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:36,588
Not one of us remembers you
saying anything about $2,000.

101
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:39,101
I forgot.
I completely forgot.

102
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:41,704
But at least now that
large piece of cardboard

103
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:43,424
that man was carrying around
makes sense.

104
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:46,788
Nellie, this is a competition.
Please take it seriously.

105
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:48,225
Oh, please.

106
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:51,628
Me? Oh, I'm fine.

107
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:55,541
I mean, sure, times are leaner now
that I'm separated from the Senator.

108
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:57,907
But my new studio apartment...

109
00:04:57,980 --> 00:05:01,029
is just fine
for me and Phillip

110
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:07,663
and Tinkie and Crinklepuss and
Bandit Two and Pawlick Baggins

111
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:10,471
and Lady Aragorn
and their 10 kittens.

112
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:15,228
Oh, my God. Come here.
Come here, let's go.

113
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:18,270
I had a chance with Dwight,
but I didn't take it.

114
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:23,227
And if I went back now, when I'm
broke and he just inherited a farm,

115
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:25,669
I'd be one of those
gold-digging tramps

116
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:28,784
you read about that
try to bag a farmer.

117
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:32,305
I offered myself to Angela,
and she turned me down.

118
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:34,701
If she changes her mind,
the next move is hers.

119
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:36,948
I'm with Esther now,
she's younger than Angela.

120
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:41,105
Sturdier, more comfortable with
the scent of a manured field.

121
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:44,943
Let's be honest, when it
came to manured fields,

122
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:47,341
Angela was,
at best, indifferent.

123
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:52,666
Oh, wide wings,
interesting.

124
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:54,185
Hey! Why don't you back off?

125
00:05:57,220 --> 00:05:59,461
I mean, best of luck
to you in the competition.

126
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:03,261
Growing up in an orphanage, you have
to fight other kids for everything.

127
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:06,025
Snacks, pillows, parents.

128
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:09,431
I'm kind of worried about
Pete seeing that side of me.

129
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:12,788
I once ripped Greedy Susan's
pigtail right off her head

130
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:14,703
just for a handful of Crispix.

131
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:18,548
Are you in that paper
documentary, too? Yup.

132
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:21,103
You need an agent?
No.

133
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:23,990
I mean, you never
acted in anything before.

134
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:26,463
He's just my entourage.

135
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:28,504
I was in The Wiz
in high school.

136
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:31,068
That's the clicky-clacker.

137
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:34,224
He clicks that, and then
the guy says, "Action."

138
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:36,548
Hey, I made 'em
get you a chair.

139
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:39,461
All my clients sit.

140
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:41,307
Can I take your picture?

141
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:46,390
I guess it's starting.

142
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:47,461
Um...

143
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:50,908
Yeah. Of course.
Yeah, sure.

144
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:53,751
Tell you what. I'll put my arm
around you, and then I can take it.

145
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:55,231
We just need a picture
of the top of your head

146
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:57,746
in case we burn
some of your hair off.

147
00:06:58,340 --> 00:06:59,387
Got it.

148
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:05,021
Sorry.

149
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:07,424
No, if you just keep it down until...

150
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:09,501
Okay-

151
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:13,631
Okay, next up we have two
creatures, great and small.

152
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:15,630
Kevin versus Angela.

153
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:16,901
Yes.

154
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:25,029
Hey, that is a really nice plane.
You make that yourself?

155
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:26,867
Uh-huh.

156
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:30,103
Well, what am I thinking? Of
course you made that yourself,

157
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:32,342
'cause it's in the rules

158
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:34,787
that you have to
fold your own plane.

159
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:36,991
Of course.

160
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:40,669
Kevin, did you
make that yourself?

161
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:43,181
Yes. In a way.

162
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:46,305
From one that I
bought on Craigslist.

163
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:48,468
Oh, man.
I call for a refold.

164
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:49,587
No.

165
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:51,825
Really?
You can't do that.

166
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:53,140
Thank you.

167
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:54,906
This is flatter.

168
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:57,665
It's a piece of paper.
You fold it into an airplane.

169
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:01,423
Okay, that's enough. This
is the end of the ream now.

170
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:02,581
You have to pick one.

171
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:05,743
I can't. I love them
all too much.

172
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:09,985
And none of them fly.
So that makes it harder.

173
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:12,028
You have to choose one now.

174
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:14,461
Fine.

175
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:20,663
Angela advances.
Nice.

176
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:22,781
Whoo!

177
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:24,908
Was Dwight rooting for me?

178
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:25,981
Hmm.

179
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:28,304
I hadn't noticed.

180
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:30,391
I'm not giving up.

181
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:33,828
I am gonna keep making planes
until one of 'em flies.

182
00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:37,587
Like Wilbur and
Orville Redenbacher.

183
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:42,581
An Earl Grey tea
for the lady.

184
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:45,149
Oh, thank you. Um...

185
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:49,063
I acknowledge and appreciate that you
went out of your way to get me tea.

186
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:52,031
Thank you.
I like being appreciated.

187
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:54,865
But, to speak my truth,
it wasn't out of the way,

188
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:57,147
because I felt like
a tea anyway, so one trip.

189
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:02,188
Well, to speak my truth,

190
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:04,425
I switched to coffee
in March.

191
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:07,181
There's a new
espresso machine.

192
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:10,783
But I still acknowledge
and appreciate the gesture.

193
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:16,426
We are rolling,
and action.

194
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:20,711
This video is to demonstrate the
HPRDC Chemical Handling Protocols.

195
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:24,707
These protocols could save you
from severe injury, even death.

196
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:26,151
Okay, um, stop.

197
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:28,188
Um, why are you smiling?

198
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:30,309
I just made a character
choice to be a scientist

199
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:33,862
who really likes what he
does and enjoys his job.

200
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:37,306
Okay, well, maybe no
smiling on this one.

201
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:38,711
So how do you want...
How should I do it?

202
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:41,431
I don't know. Just like you're
reporting the news or something.

203
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:42,865
Yeah.
Okay? Action.

204
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:45,022
This video is to demonstrate

205
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:49,190
the HPRDC Chemical
Handling Protocols.

206
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:51,467
It's Tom Brokaw,
the newscaster. Come on.

207
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:53,110
- Who was that?
- Tom Brokaw.

208
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:57,101
Come on, Clark!

209
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:02,261
Whoa!

210
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:05,628
Yeah! Oh, eat it, piggy! Eat it!

211
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:06,787
Oink, oink, oink.

212
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:08,988
We still got to work together,
so we should keep it civil.

213
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:12,342
I can't hear what you said.

214
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:14,070
You get your slop?

215
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:16,302
All right, you know what, this
is completely unnecessary.

216
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:17,381
You already won.
Just stop.

217
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:18,461
Erin. Erin.

218
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:20,190
What?
Relax.

219
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:21,989
Next up we have
Dwight and Phyllis.

220
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:23,785
You can do it, baby.

221
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:25,271
No, you can't, baby.

222
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:27,104
You're gonna choke.

223
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:32,066
Watch and learn.

224
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:39,502
Dwight defeats Phyllis. Dwight, you
are through to the semifinals.

225
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:41,264
Yes.
All right.

226
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:42,911
Oh, Esther,
what are you...

227
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:44,391
Hey-

228
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:49,506
You're here early.

229
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:51,025
Yeah, I plucked
the chickens extra fast,

230
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:52,465
'cause I knew I was
seeing you tonight.

231
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:55,020
So, there mightjust be a little
bit of feather in your nuggets

232
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:57,228
or just a little bit of
meat inside of your pillow.

233
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:58,945
I like a little
feather in my nuggets.

234
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:02,346
All right,
ladies and gentlemen,

235
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:05,071
we are now down
to the final four.

236
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:07,347
Dwight, Erin, Angela,

237
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:10,710
and God only
knows how, but Toby.

238
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:14,991
One of you will
walk away with $2,000.

239
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:16,701
Yeah!

240
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:19,791
Okay, here you have just
knocked over the beaker.

241
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:21,669
The chemicals splashed
in your eye.

242
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:23,583
Which is insanely painful.
Yeah.

243
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:26,743
And I've already picked a few
childhood memories to tap into

244
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:27,901
to really express that pain.

245
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:28,981
That's great.

246
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:33,426
So what you're gonna do then is come
over here to the eye washing station

247
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:35,104
and then just kind of
flush out your eyes,

248
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:37,660
you know, get the
chemicals out, all right?

249
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:41,306
So I just lean over
this thing and then

250
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:43,826
you'll add the water
special effect later?

251
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:45,705
What water special effect?

252
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:48,670
Yeah, just hold your
lids open with one hand

253
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:50,868
and let the stream
bathe your eyeballs.

254
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:52,871
Like that.

255
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:55,347
I'm not comfortable
doing my own stunts.

256
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:57,990
I'll get nude if
you want me to.

257
00:11:58,060 --> 00:12:00,381
I'll go full Lena Dunham,
but I...

258
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:02,110
Dude, we don't need
you to go nude, okay?

259
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:03,261
Absolutely not.

260
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:05,502
Justdo the eyewash thing, okay?
That's all we're asking here.

261
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:10,911
Darryl, what do I do?

262
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:12,470
Hold up, I'm looking at my
spit in the microscope.

263
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:15,510
They want me to use real
water in the eyewash scene.

264
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:18,951
So? I can't squirt
stuff in my eyeball.

265
00:12:19,020 --> 00:12:20,624
I've never even
used an eyedropper.

266
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:23,101
So, Andy, you saw how
to use this?

267
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:26,389
You step on the pedal.
Water squirts in your eyes.

268
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:29,746
Carla!

269
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:32,061
Carla!

270
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:34,791
It is time for
a little T and A.

271
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:37,187
I give you Toby and Angela.

272
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:42,628
- On, my God!
- Whoa!

273
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:47,741
Oh, my God.
Okay, it's your turn.

274
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:56,265
Well, Angela is the winner.

275
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:57,341
Yes.

276
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:02,947
Is there a reason that we're
excited for that little woman?

277
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:04,506
Yes, I pity her.

278
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:06,191
She was recently
in a situation

279
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:08,786
where she could
have had it all,

280
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:10,784
and instead she
lost everything.

281
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:13,028
Mmm. Is she a gambler?

282
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:16,866
In a way, but not in a stand-up-and-cheer
kind of way, like the song.

283
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:18,351
Mmm.

284
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:19,825
That is sad.

285
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:24,541
Andy, if you don't stick
your eyes in that machine,

286
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:28,461
I'm gonna call every production
in Northeastern Pennsylvania.

287
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:32,784
You won't even make an
appearance on a security camera!

288
00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:39,669
What's the holdup here?

289
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:41,710
The actor's crying.

290
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:43,464
Oh, God.

291
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:49,344
She yelled at me.

292
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:54,462
I can't wash my eyeball.
I can't do that. I can't.

293
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:56,823
Andy Bernard can't
squirt water in his eye

294
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:58,186
and act like it
doesn't freak him out.

295
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:00,941
But you know who can?

296
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:05,106
Older Male Lab
Assistant Number One.

297
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:08,190
Do you believe in me?

298
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:09,900
Ibeheveu.

299
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:12,265
I want to go home.

300
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:18,470
Yeah! Okay. Beat that.

301
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:27,150
Whoo!

302
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:30,182
Okay.
Damn it!

303
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:32,670
Damn it! God...

304
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:34,783
Sorry. Yeah,
I'm fine. I'm fine.

305
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:35,986
Okay.
I got mad.

306
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:37,784
Yeah. 'Cause I don't
like losing, Pete.

307
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:40,943
I'm just gonna... Sorry, I'm mad, Pete.
I'm mad. I'm really mad.

308
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:42,624
I wanted to win. We were
gonna win a lot of money.

309
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:44,748
I was gonna buy you a sweater.
So this is stupid.

310
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:47,471
It's just the whole contest is stupid.
So it feels...

311
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:48,507
Oh!

312
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:49,911
Sorry, I'm mad.
Okay.

313
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:52,221
I don't like losing.
I thought I was going to win.

314
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:54,149
Okay, hey, hey, hey-

315
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:55,824
Sorry. Sorry.

316
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:57,425
I'm gonna go
upstairs and just...

317
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:01,147
Oh, I made us a date to
take my mom out to dinner

318
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:02,665
to thank her for all
that extra babysitting.

319
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:06,422
Well, you know how much I
appreciate the opportunity

320
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:07,706
to hang out
with your mom more,

321
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:09,151
so let me just put
this in my calendar.

322
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:10,991
I acknowledge
with gratitude

323
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:12,903
that you are being kind
and responsible enough

324
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:14,863
to include it in your calendar.

325
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:16,988
Thank you.
Your mom is a treasure.

326
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:18,506
Well, I appreciate
that some opportunities...

327
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:19,701
can be unpleasant...

328
00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:20,827
Sorry, it's work. Hold.

329
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:23,267
Hey, Wade, did Cole
Hamels call back or what?

330
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:25,631
Great. Good.

331
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:28,108
Uh, to speak my truth, I'd
appreciate it if you hung that up,

332
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:29,466
'cause we were in the
middle of a conversation.

333
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:36,262
I appreciate the sacrifice.

334
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:40,585
Okay, to speak my truth,
that was a little sarcastic.

335
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:42,549
I think that's
a little unfair.

336
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:43,826
Really?

337
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:46,910
I've been putting the kids to bed
by myself every night for months.

338
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:49,148
And you had to
miss one phone call.

339
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:51,063
Is that your truth, Jim?
That's really your truth?

340
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:54,301
I guess I will
swallow my truth.

341
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:56,949
Are you guys high?

342
00:15:57,020 --> 00:15:59,864
Because, if so,
to speak my truth,

343
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:03,308
I would appreciate
the sacrifice of including me

344
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:05,223
in some hits
off your kind buds.

345
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:07,065
We're not high.

346
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:10,828
I wish we'd started this
exercise six months ago.

347
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:13,107
My heartjust feels so...

348
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:15,305
Blocked up.

349
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:23,149
The Mark 47 is
ready for launch.

350
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:30,741
Less paste.

351
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:37,710
Here we go. Rolling and action.

352
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:46,540
And cut.

353
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:48,749
We can fix the sound in post.
Yeah.

354
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:50,141
I can do a better one.

355
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:51,267
That's fine.
We'll move on.

356
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:52,825
I said I can do
a better one.

357
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:55,387
Darryl.

358
00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:56,461
Action.

359
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:11,265
Kid can act.

360
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:15,464
Yeah. Yeah.

361
00:17:17,340 --> 00:17:20,025
Each contestant will
throw two airplanes.

362
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:22,829
After you.
Thank you.

363
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:27,026
Oh, God.

364
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:30,785
Angela's first throw,
terrible.

365
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:32,747
NELLIEI Dwight.

366
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:35,021
Oh!

367
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:37,700
Oh, man! It slipped out of my hand.
What a whiff.

368
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:40,228
Oh,
how'd that happen? God.

369
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:43,985
We want you to win. Dwight
told me about your situation.

370
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:45,704
It's such a pity.

371
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:48,709
Just use the money wisely.

372
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:50,226
Okay?

373
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:52,066
Okay-

374
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:56,431
All right.

375
00:17:58,060 --> 00:18:00,062
Don't you dare tank this.

376
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:19,261
And we have a winner.
And it's Dwight.

377
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:22,105
And it is everyone,
because this is over.

378
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:25,146
Two grand, huh?

379
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:28,384
I know a guy who can
turn that into $800.

380
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:29,871
Hint, it's me.

381
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:34,065
VVeH, lguess you needed the
money more than me, huh?

382
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:35,630
Use it wisely.

383
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:41,188
I was
disappointed in Dwight today.

384
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:43,228
He showed a weakness
that was unbecoming.

385
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:45,787
Even if he did do it for me.

386
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:49,224
I don't need pity,
and I don't need charity.

387
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:52,022
I have my dignity,
and that's enough.

388
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:54,706
And as long as I
have that, I'll be okay.

389
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:10,388
I know this was really weird
and it was really hard.

390
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:13,501
But I think we're
making progress.

391
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:19,302
So, I'm really sorry that I have
to go, but let's keep at this.

392
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:21,983
Okay_
Okay?

393
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:05,067
Jim!

394
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:13,181
Thanks.

395
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:14,907
All right,
have a good trip.

396
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:15,981
Bye.
Bye.

397
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:20,021
Hey-

398
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:28,427
I...

399
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:48,225
"Love suffers
long and is kind.

400
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:50,386
"It is not proud.

401
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:52,823
"Love bears all things,

402
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:55,269
"believes all things,

403
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:59,227
"hopes all things,
and endures all things.

404
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:01,904
"Love never fails.

405
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:04,981
"And now these three remain.

406
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:07,870
"Faith, hope, and love.

407
00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:12,421
"But the greatest
of these is love."

408
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:22,148
I love you.
I love you.
