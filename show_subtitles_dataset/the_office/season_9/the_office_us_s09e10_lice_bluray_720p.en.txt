1
00:00:01,090 --> 00:00:04,811
To me, the Sixers
are a five seed, tops.

2
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:06,813
I think they're going to
the conference finals.

3
00:00:06,890 --> 00:00:10,736
Bynum, obvious monster, three-point
shooting, don't even...

4
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:13,819
I bit my lip at
lunch today.

5
00:00:15,410 --> 00:00:16,855
Sucks.

6
00:00:16,930 --> 00:00:19,297
Anyway, I just don't see it.
The Knicks are tough.

7
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:21,096
The Nets are tough.

8
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:22,860
The Nets
are super tough.

9
00:00:22,930 --> 00:00:26,298
And now I have this big bump
on my lip that hurts!

10
00:00:27,130 --> 00:00:28,291
I hate it.

11
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:31,212
The Hawks are terrible.

12
00:00:31,290 --> 00:00:32,735
They're always terrible.

13
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:36,013
Okay, you need to think about
it before you come with the...

14
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:41,692
Whatever.
It's not a big deal.

15
00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:43,010
You know, I always
tell my three-year-old,

16
00:00:43,090 --> 00:00:44,819
if this is the worst thing
that's going to happen...

17
00:00:44,890 --> 00:00:46,540
You got to be
kidding me!

18
00:00:46,610 --> 00:00:50,615
Okay, Pam! That's it!
I'm going home!

19
00:01:03,650 --> 00:01:05,334
Morning, Meredith!

20
00:01:06,130 --> 00:01:07,131
What?

21
00:01:07,690 --> 00:01:09,101
Sorry, Pam.

22
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:10,331
Yikes.

23
00:01:11,690 --> 00:01:14,341
Jim's been spending a few
days a week in Philly,

24
00:01:14,410 --> 00:01:17,493
and I'm not going to lie,
it's been challenging.

25
00:01:20,090 --> 00:01:22,252
Yesterday, things took
a turn for the worse.

26
00:01:22,330 --> 00:01:24,378
I found out
Cece has lice.

27
00:01:24,650 --> 00:01:26,175
So, I was up all night

28
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:29,857
disinfecting every
sheet, towel, toy,

29
00:01:29,930 --> 00:01:32,774
item of clothing
in the entire house.

30
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:34,978
I'm exhausted.

31
00:01:35,050 --> 00:01:36,336
But don't tell Jim.

32
00:01:36,770 --> 00:01:38,898
He has a huge
meeting today.

33
00:01:39,330 --> 00:01:41,492
Under a lot of pressure,

34
00:01:42,290 --> 00:01:43,894
and he's doing it
all for the family.

35
00:01:44,450 --> 00:01:48,375
I am meeting Dr. J today,
otherwise known as Julius Erving,

36
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:51,693
famed 76er
and my own personal hero.

37
00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:54,011
But I have to be careful not
to rub it in Pam's face,

38
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:55,740
because
let's be honest.

39
00:01:55,810 --> 00:01:58,336
How would I feel if I was at
home, stuck with the kids

40
00:01:58,410 --> 00:02:02,210
while she was go-karting
with John Stamos?

41
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:04,818
You sound tired.
Everything okay?

42
00:02:05,010 --> 00:02:06,739
Great!
Everything's great!

43
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:08,852
Hey, are you nervous
about your big meeting?

44
00:02:09,450 --> 00:02:12,294
Little bit. It's a lot
of pressure, you know?

45
00:02:12,370 --> 00:02:14,054
But that's what I
signed up for, right?

46
00:02:14,130 --> 00:02:15,939
Jim, the limo's here.

47
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:20,776
You know what? I've got to hop
off, because my taxi is here

48
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:22,090
to take me
to the meeting.

49
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:23,376
Call me later.
Okay.

50
00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:24,451
Good luck!
Thanks.

51
00:02:24,530 --> 00:02:26,020
I love you.
Love you, too. Bye.

52
00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:30,579
How you doing?
I'm okay.

53
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:31,936
I mean, it's what
you want, so...

54
00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:33,421
It's how it has to be.

55
00:02:33,770 --> 00:02:35,340
I know, I know.

56
00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:36,931
It's just hard.

57
00:02:37,010 --> 00:02:39,217
Me and Val were going nowhere,

58
00:02:39,290 --> 00:02:40,974
and if I'm going to
be working in Philly,

59
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:42,495
I'm going to need my freedom.

60
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:44,811
So I convinced Val
to break up with me.

61
00:02:44,890 --> 00:02:45,891
Here's how you do it.

62
00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:48,701
You say, "What are you going
to do, break up with me?"

63
00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:49,976
Like, as a joke

64
00:02:50,050 --> 00:02:51,973
and then you gain
a lot of weight.

65
00:02:52,210 --> 00:02:54,690
I'll never be sorry.
Not for a moment of it.

66
00:02:54,770 --> 00:02:55,976
Me neither.

67
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:02,297
Hey, Meredith, I need your
supply requests today.

68
00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:05,135
Jesus H. in the morning, will
you stop your nagging already?

69
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:06,490
No wonder Jim left you.

70
00:03:06,570 --> 00:03:08,891
He didn't leave me.
He just went part-time.

71
00:03:12,850 --> 00:03:14,295
Can you just fill out
the form, please?

72
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:15,417
Yes.

73
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:19,658
I'm sure she's
just confused.

74
00:03:19,730 --> 00:03:22,256
People scratch their heads
when they're confused.

75
00:03:23,490 --> 00:03:26,937
Not always like an ape, the way
Meredith just did, but it happens.

76
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:29,091
Hurry up already.

77
00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:30,695
Trust me, I know what I'm doing.

78
00:03:30,770 --> 00:03:34,331
Between the foster homes and the
orphanage, I had lice 22 times.

79
00:03:35,690 --> 00:03:36,851
Holy wow,
that's a big one.

80
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:39,297
All right, pencils down,
everyone, we've got lice!

81
00:03:40,490 --> 00:03:44,461
God, Meredith! Lice? Did you
not sign a pledge to shower?

82
00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:47,097
What? Lice?

83
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:48,976
Oh, my God.

84
00:03:49,050 --> 00:03:51,371
Lock the doors,
we are on full quarantine!

85
00:03:51,450 --> 00:03:55,136
Dwight, relax! It's just lice.
Maybe. Possibly.

86
00:03:55,210 --> 00:03:57,292
Just lice, Pam?

87
00:03:57,890 --> 00:04:00,621
Of all the vermin in God's
great green kingdom,

88
00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:03,057
lice are the ones
I detest the most.

89
00:04:03,130 --> 00:04:06,896
My first day of school, I had lice
and no one would play with me.

90
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:09,735
For 15 years,
they called me freak,

91
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:12,654
and four-eyes, and sci-fi
nerd and girl puncher,

92
00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:15,131
all because I had
lice when I was seven.

93
00:04:15,770 --> 00:04:17,738
Make way. No, inspect me.
Dwight!

94
00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:23,654
This is the cleanest scalp I've ever seen.
You are all clear.

95
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:26,131
I should be. I use lice
shampoo every morning.

96
00:04:26,890 --> 00:04:28,494
Hey!
Stop that!

97
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:29,975
Dwight!

98
00:04:30,090 --> 00:04:31,501
Next.

99
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:33,937
Geez, Meredith!
This is an office,

100
00:04:34,010 --> 00:04:35,853
it's not one of
your beanbag orgies.

101
00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:37,341
Let's give her a break.

102
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:39,936
We don't know for sure
this is Meredith's fault.

103
00:04:40,010 --> 00:04:43,014
Pam, really? Come on.

104
00:04:43,170 --> 00:04:45,411
Well, what do you want?
I know who I am.

105
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:46,855
Nobody's taking
Meredith Palmer

106
00:04:47,010 --> 00:04:48,375
to the opera
to meet the Queen.

107
00:04:48,450 --> 00:04:49,736
Lice! More lice.

108
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:51,456
Angela has lice.

109
00:04:51,650 --> 00:04:52,697
Ew!

110
00:04:53,770 --> 00:04:55,818
Ooh! Yabber. Lice!

111
00:04:55,890 --> 00:04:57,415
Yikers, lice.

112
00:04:57,530 --> 00:04:59,055
No!

113
00:04:59,130 --> 00:05:01,258
How? I'm so clean.

114
00:05:01,330 --> 00:05:03,139
Yeah, big time lice.
Ah!

115
00:05:03,210 --> 00:05:06,532
I wash my hands at least six times a day.
Toilet seat covers?

116
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:08,100
Yes, thank you,
even when I pee.

117
00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:10,411
Apparently none of that
is protection enough,

118
00:05:10,490 --> 00:05:12,379
not when it
comes to Meredith.

119
00:05:15,410 --> 00:05:16,650
Oh!

120
00:05:16,730 --> 00:05:18,300
Hey, what are you wearing?

121
00:05:18,370 --> 00:05:21,692
It's a hazmat suit. That stands
for hazardous materials...

122
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:24,611
Men's suit wearing.

123
00:05:24,690 --> 00:05:27,421
If you rent more than four times a
year, it just makes sense to buy.

124
00:05:27,490 --> 00:05:30,733
ls there anyone else
here that is lice free?

125
00:05:32,890 --> 00:05:34,972
Excellent! You have
your own hazmat suits?

126
00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:36,381
No.
No.

127
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:37,901
Renters.

128
00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:40,052
Okay, I'm going to need you
to gather your belongings,

129
00:05:40,130 --> 00:05:42,132
retreat to the warehouse,

130
00:05:42,210 --> 00:05:43,974
conduct your
business there

131
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:46,257
until the infected
have been de-loused.

132
00:05:46,370 --> 00:05:48,691
Let's get going. I'm going
to stay here and fight.

133
00:05:48,770 --> 00:05:51,057
If you don't hear from
me by lunch, call me.

134
00:05:51,130 --> 00:05:52,575
I might want lunch.

135
00:05:52,650 --> 00:05:54,778
All right, we're going
down to my warehouse.

136
00:05:54,890 --> 00:05:57,097
That means we're
playing by my rules.

137
00:05:57,410 --> 00:05:58,821
No messing with the baler.

138
00:05:58,890 --> 00:06:00,733
And be cool in front of me
and Val, we just broke up.

139
00:06:01,890 --> 00:06:03,016
You got dumped?

140
00:06:03,090 --> 00:06:04,421
Yeah, she ended things.

141
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:05,895
Break-ups
are the worst.

142
00:06:05,970 --> 00:06:07,210
The only thing that
got me through mine

143
00:06:07,330 --> 00:06:08,536
was large amounts
of shepherd's pie

144
00:06:08,610 --> 00:06:11,454
and Brandy, the singer,
not the drink.

145
00:06:12,210 --> 00:06:15,976
Here, man. You need
that more than me.

146
00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:17,540
Thanks, man.
Yeah.

147
00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:23,931
Guys, I think we should
all ease up on Meredith.

148
00:06:24,010 --> 00:06:25,455
This has got to
be hard for her.

149
00:06:25,530 --> 00:06:28,739
No, no, no, no. I have not
yet begun to shame.

150
00:06:28,810 --> 00:06:31,177
That's it! I'm getting my stuff.
I'm leaving for the day.

151
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:32,451
No! Stanley!

152
00:06:32,530 --> 00:06:34,055
If you leave now, then
you'll get it in your car

153
00:06:34,210 --> 00:06:35,700
and then you'll
get it in your house!

154
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:36,851
Get off me!

155
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:38,500
I'm trying to save
you from yourself!

156
00:06:38,570 --> 00:06:40,732
All right, I'll stay!

157
00:06:41,170 --> 00:06:43,298
There's a pencil
poking into my rolls.

158
00:06:44,810 --> 00:06:46,380
PAM". Maybe it was Meredith.

159
00:06:46,450 --> 00:06:49,056
Maybe she brought in lice
that are totally different

160
00:06:49,130 --> 00:06:51,417
than the lice
that I got from Cece.

161
00:06:51,490 --> 00:06:55,814
So, let's notjump to the simplest
conclusion that she got her lice from me!

162
00:06:55,890 --> 00:06:58,097
That is how wars
get started.

163
00:07:00,650 --> 00:07:01,981
Fine, I'll tell her
it was me.

164
00:07:04,170 --> 00:07:06,901
Oh, man!
That's fresh squeezed!

165
00:07:06,970 --> 00:07:09,416
And are all
the snacks complimentary?

166
00:07:09,490 --> 00:07:11,777
Yeah. Take some home
if you want.

167
00:07:11,850 --> 00:07:13,818
No, that's okay. I'm...

168
00:07:22,930 --> 00:07:24,580
I'm sorry, is this
the conference center?

169
00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:27,972
No, Mr. Erving called, said he'd
rather meet you at his private court.

170
00:07:29,690 --> 00:07:31,499
You've got to be kidding me.

171
00:07:34,650 --> 00:07:37,221
Hey, Meredith, I need to tell you some...
Yeah, Pam? What do you want?

172
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:39,338
Oh, my God! Meredith.
What are you doing?

173
00:07:39,410 --> 00:07:41,139
Baking a cake. What does
it look like I'm doing?

174
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:42,894
Getting rid of the lice.
Stop!

175
00:07:42,970 --> 00:07:44,017
I'm so sorry!

176
00:07:44,090 --> 00:07:45,137
Can you hold that thought?

177
00:07:45,210 --> 00:07:46,860
That's my wax.
You know, I think

178
00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:48,580
these critters
migrated from down south.

179
00:07:50,450 --> 00:07:51,531
What were you saying?

180
00:07:52,330 --> 00:07:53,536
Nothing.

181
00:07:53,610 --> 00:07:57,581
I'm going to tell her. But
now is clearly not the time.

182
00:07:57,650 --> 00:08:01,416
I will buy her a wig,
we'll have a few laughs.

183
00:08:01,490 --> 00:08:03,777
There's a right
way to do this.

184
00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:10,577
Scalp leeches. Skull vampires.
Follicle gypsies.

185
00:08:10,650 --> 00:08:12,140
Hair lawyers.

186
00:08:12,210 --> 00:08:14,577
One thing is clear,
it's kill or be killed!

187
00:08:14,650 --> 00:08:18,541
No, no, no. It's more of a nuisance,
really. It's not that big a deal.

188
00:08:18,610 --> 00:08:20,214
So, I've collected your
hats and your coats...

189
00:08:20,290 --> 00:08:21,291
To be burned!

190
00:08:21,410 --> 00:08:22,457
To be washed.

191
00:08:22,530 --> 00:08:23,975
What do we do
about our heads'?

192
00:08:24,050 --> 00:08:26,701
I'm not going
to lie. Lye!

193
00:08:26,770 --> 00:08:28,932
No. All we need
is mayonnaise.

194
00:08:29,010 --> 00:08:30,216
Excuse me?

195
00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:31,570
She's right, it works.

196
00:08:32,210 --> 00:08:33,541
I would imagine.

197
00:08:33,610 --> 00:08:36,136
Yes, it helps to suffocate
the little buddies.

198
00:08:36,210 --> 00:08:38,133
And it's a really
healthy alternative to

199
00:08:38,290 --> 00:08:40,258
the chemicals found
in most lice shampoos.

200
00:08:40,330 --> 00:08:41,661
I can appreciate that.

201
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:44,415
I also only eat local,
organic produce.

202
00:08:46,770 --> 00:08:47,771
Sha-boom!

203
00:08:47,890 --> 00:08:49,255
How you like me now?

204
00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:52,495
Take a picture,
it'll last longer.

205
00:08:52,570 --> 00:08:55,050
We don't want it to
last longer. It's horrible.

206
00:08:55,130 --> 00:08:56,655
Bald people make me sick.

207
00:08:56,770 --> 00:08:59,011
Yeah, yeah, everybody
pile on Meredith.

208
00:08:59,090 --> 00:09:02,219
But I'm the only one with the balls
to show them lice who's boss.

209
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:05,696
Okay, nobody panic!

210
00:09:05,770 --> 00:09:07,420
If everybody just follows
my instructions,

211
00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:09,260
then nobody else
needs to end up bald.

212
00:09:09,770 --> 00:09:13,411
Not that it looks bad, Meredith!
It looks... It looks awesome!

213
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:16,576
You look like a baby who
suddenly aged 50 years.

214
00:09:16,650 --> 00:09:18,220
A cute baby!

215
00:09:18,330 --> 00:09:20,298
But something sucked
the life force out of it.

216
00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:22,532
I'm so sorry. We need mayonnaise.
We need it now.

217
00:09:22,610 --> 00:09:26,251
I'll go.
It's not a big deal.

218
00:09:26,330 --> 00:09:28,253
Please. No, Meredith,
can I get you

219
00:09:28,370 --> 00:09:30,259
something special
while I'm at the store?

220
00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:33,413
Candy, or one of
those stylish turbans?

221
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:36,812
Thanks, Pam. I'll take a pack of
Nicorette gum and a pack of Kools.

222
00:09:37,090 --> 00:09:38,296
Okay-

223
00:09:41,650 --> 00:09:43,379
Let's talk pubes, people.

224
00:09:44,330 --> 00:09:45,855
Hey, Darryl.

225
00:09:45,930 --> 00:09:47,136
Hey, Val.

226
00:09:52,730 --> 00:09:54,016
That was tragic.

227
00:09:54,810 --> 00:09:57,814
That was like a car crash,
I couldn't look away.

228
00:09:57,890 --> 00:10:00,496
You two still clearly have
feelings for each other.

229
00:10:00,570 --> 00:10:01,571
Yeah.

230
00:10:01,650 --> 00:10:03,618
What's going to make you
feel better, big guy?

231
00:10:03,690 --> 00:10:06,899
When I was a kid, my grandmother
used to make me chocolate cake

232
00:10:06,970 --> 00:10:08,415
when I wasn't feeling good.

233
00:10:08,490 --> 00:10:10,379
She's not around
to do that anymore.

234
00:10:10,450 --> 00:10:14,694
I'm sorry, I just need a moment
to myself to clear my head.

235
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:19,815
Poor Darryl. I can't bear to
see him suffer like this.

236
00:10:19,890 --> 00:10:23,212
I think he needs
some hugs

237
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:25,338
and maybe some
chocolate cake.

238
00:10:26,170 --> 00:10:29,492
This won't help him,
it's a muffin. Not cake.

239
00:10:29,610 --> 00:10:31,931
Listen, let's try to get Darryl
the one thing in the world

240
00:10:32,010 --> 00:10:34,456
he clearly wants
and needs the most.

241
00:10:34,530 --> 00:10:35,941
An Escalade.

242
00:10:36,290 --> 00:10:38,179
Or, what's-her-name?

243
00:10:39,050 --> 00:10:40,131
Val.

244
00:10:40,210 --> 00:10:42,019
Let's get Darryl Val.

245
00:10:43,330 --> 00:10:45,059
I hope you don't mind me
bringing you out here.

246
00:10:45,170 --> 00:10:46,854
I can't get my knees
under a desk.

247
00:10:46,930 --> 00:10:49,456
Are you kidding me? I could
literally scalp tickets to this.

248
00:10:49,530 --> 00:10:51,214
Well, you think you
can sink one from deep?

249
00:10:51,890 --> 00:10:54,416
Listen, I don't
mean to intimidate you,

250
00:10:54,490 --> 00:10:56,458
but I did play
a little high school ball.

251
00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:57,736
Okay-

252
00:11:00,490 --> 00:11:01,491
Wow!

253
00:11:01,610 --> 00:11:03,772
Halpert's got game!

254
00:11:03,850 --> 00:11:05,090
All right. Sorry.

255
00:11:05,810 --> 00:11:08,461
I'm so sorry, this is my wife.
Can I take this?

256
00:11:08,530 --> 00:11:10,419
If it's your wife,
you better take it.

257
00:11:10,490 --> 00:11:11,571
Right?

258
00:11:13,810 --> 00:11:16,256
Hey, what's up?
Everything okay?

259
00:11:16,330 --> 00:11:17,900
Oh, no,
everything's great!

260
00:11:18,410 --> 00:11:20,651
I was just calling to see
how the meeting went.

261
00:11:20,730 --> 00:11:23,131
It's still happening
right now, actually. So...

262
00:11:23,210 --> 00:11:25,292
He's really making
you work for it, huh?

263
00:11:25,370 --> 00:11:29,500
Yes, it is very stressful. Are
you sure everything's okay?

264
00:11:29,570 --> 00:11:31,937
Great. Lam killing it
over here.

265
00:11:34,890 --> 00:11:36,699
Jim, I've got to go.
Okay, bye.

266
00:11:37,450 --> 00:11:38,497
So sorry about that.

267
00:11:38,570 --> 00:11:40,732
No problem. Hey, Jim, what
size do you wear, man?

268
00:11:40,850 --> 00:11:43,615
I got a pair of Japanese Nikes
with your name on them.

269
00:11:43,850 --> 00:11:45,500
What do you think?
I love it!

270
00:11:46,810 --> 00:11:49,336
Once it's all over your head, just
leave it there for four hours.

271
00:11:49,410 --> 00:11:52,459
That will be enough time
for the lice to fall asleep,

272
00:11:52,570 --> 00:11:54,334
suffocate and then
pass away.

273
00:11:55,050 --> 00:11:56,211
Sure.

274
00:11:56,290 --> 00:11:59,100
And when you're
ready to get serious,

275
00:11:59,210 --> 00:12:02,020
come to me to
get it done right.

276
00:12:02,090 --> 00:12:04,331
Put those away
before you hurt yourself.

277
00:12:07,610 --> 00:12:09,738
Oh, God! No.

278
00:12:10,650 --> 00:12:13,301
No! No!

279
00:12:13,930 --> 00:12:17,093
No! No! No!

280
00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:20,572
No! No!

281
00:12:20,650 --> 00:12:23,654
Okay, it's easier with a
buddy, so everybody pair up.

282
00:12:23,970 --> 00:12:26,371
Oscar, you want
to be my partner?

283
00:12:26,970 --> 00:12:29,177
Yeah. Yeah, sure.
Pdloveto.

284
00:12:29,970 --> 00:12:34,214
Hey, mayo buddy, $5 tip if
you unclog my ears. Okay?

285
00:12:34,610 --> 00:12:35,657
Oh...

286
00:12:35,810 --> 00:12:39,212
Creed, I'm so sorry. I'm already
partners with Pete. Right, Pete?

287
00:12:39,330 --> 00:12:43,051
Uh... Yeah. We promised each other
if we ever got lice, we'd buddy up,

288
00:12:43,130 --> 00:12:44,575
so, sorry, man.

289
00:12:47,370 --> 00:12:50,135
Hey, Creed. You want
to be my buddy?

290
00:12:50,610 --> 00:12:52,817
Oh, God.
Stuck with the weirdo.

291
00:12:59,410 --> 00:13:02,539
Angela! You don't
want bugs, you know?

292
00:13:02,610 --> 00:13:05,898
Who knows where
those bugs will end up?

293
00:13:06,530 --> 00:13:09,010
You're getting a bargain.
I ain't got no hair no more.

294
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:12,581
Creed.

295
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:15,934
I'm all done. My turn.

296
00:13:16,010 --> 00:13:18,775
I'm sorry, Pam.
It looks a little messy.

297
00:13:19,770 --> 00:13:20,817
Wait.

298
00:13:24,410 --> 00:13:25,571
How's that?

299
00:13:25,690 --> 00:13:26,896
I feel it working.

300
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:32,496
Eiffel Tower!

301
00:13:36,530 --> 00:13:37,691
Can I help you?

302
00:13:37,770 --> 00:13:41,741
Well, we don't want to pry, but we
heard you broke up with Darryl.

303
00:13:41,810 --> 00:13:43,050
Yeah, that's true.

304
00:13:43,130 --> 00:13:44,973
We think you made
a big, big mistake.

305
00:13:45,050 --> 00:13:46,051
Big mistake.

306
00:13:46,210 --> 00:13:47,211
Quite enormous.

307
00:13:47,290 --> 00:13:50,453
He's a real catch and you
should take him back.

308
00:13:50,530 --> 00:13:53,295
Okay, thank you.
Is that all?

309
00:13:53,370 --> 00:13:55,657
No. No, that is not all!

310
00:13:55,730 --> 00:13:57,937
Let me tell you
what real life is like.

311
00:13:58,290 --> 00:14:00,292
The men dry up
and the nights get lonely.

312
00:14:00,370 --> 00:14:03,260
The only calls on your machine
are from collection agencies

313
00:14:03,330 --> 00:14:05,981
about that pair of motorcycle
boots you've never even worn.

314
00:14:06,050 --> 00:14:08,860
You stalk your old high-school
boyfriend online,

315
00:14:08,930 --> 00:14:11,615
go to his daughter's soccer
games and make a scene.

316
00:14:11,690 --> 00:14:13,931
You buy a diamond ring
for yourself,

317
00:14:14,010 --> 00:14:17,378
wear it on your right hand and
tell yourself you're all you need.

318
00:14:17,450 --> 00:14:22,741
One day you're alone, tired,
at your feet, a dying bird.

319
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:25,571
Where did it come from?
Why did you kill it?

320
00:14:25,650 --> 00:14:29,655
Is it because, in some
strange way, it is you?

321
00:14:29,730 --> 00:14:32,017
Thank you all
for your concern,

322
00:14:32,090 --> 00:14:34,411
but I'm going to have to
ask you toleave, okay?

323
00:14:39,330 --> 00:14:41,981
So does this mean you're
going to take Darryl back?

324
00:14:42,050 --> 00:14:43,051
No.

325
00:14:43,130 --> 00:14:47,260
Well, then, what would you say
to you and me hitting the town,

326
00:14:47,930 --> 00:14:52,333
because I'm free
literally forever.

327
00:14:53,050 --> 00:14:54,336
Yeah, Kevin asked me out.

328
00:14:54,410 --> 00:14:57,698
I was kind of feeling good about
re-entering the dating pool,

329
00:14:57,770 --> 00:14:59,420
and then Kevin
asked me out.

330
00:14:59,490 --> 00:15:01,936
Thought I might trade up
to a new level of man.

331
00:15:02,330 --> 00:15:03,980
Then Kevin asked me out.

332
00:15:16,130 --> 00:15:17,131
Hello?

333
00:15:17,210 --> 00:15:18,211
Hi, honey, it's Mom.

334
00:15:18,290 --> 00:15:21,851
Look, Gene's school just called.
She still has lice!

335
00:15:21,930 --> 00:15:23,739
What, no. That can't...
I don't...

336
00:15:23,810 --> 00:15:26,051
Don't worry, don't worry,
I'm on my way to pick her up.

337
00:15:26,130 --> 00:15:29,930
But you might have lice, too. Lice
can be tricky. Sometimes lice...

338
00:15:31,090 --> 00:15:32,455
Oh, my God.

339
00:15:32,730 --> 00:15:37,338
Shave her head!

340
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:43,139
You guys, I'm so sorry.

341
00:15:43,210 --> 00:15:45,212
It's just been so chaotic
with Jim gone that I...

342
00:15:45,290 --> 00:15:46,974
Yeah, yeah.
Princess Fancy Pants,

343
00:15:47,050 --> 00:15:49,940
letting Jane Twelve Pack
over here take the fall.

344
00:15:50,010 --> 00:15:51,216
She's right, Pam.

345
00:15:51,290 --> 00:15:53,577
ls there a volume knob
on that thing?

346
00:15:53,650 --> 00:15:55,857
Yes, there's a volume knob
on that thing!

347
00:15:57,690 --> 00:16:01,411
Meredith,
I am so sorry.

348
00:16:01,490 --> 00:16:04,573
Well, a lot of good your sorries
are doing her now, Pam.

349
00:16:04,650 --> 00:16:06,220
She's a monster.

350
00:16:08,210 --> 00:16:10,531
I meant to say something
earlier, I just...

351
00:16:10,610 --> 00:16:12,214
Just, just what?

352
00:16:13,370 --> 00:16:14,576
Just forgot?

353
00:16:15,210 --> 00:16:18,100
Who's the one that didn't
bring lice into the office?

354
00:16:18,210 --> 00:16:19,780
Meredith.

355
00:16:19,850 --> 00:16:21,579
Sure I gave everybody
pink eye once,

356
00:16:21,690 --> 00:16:23,454
and my ex keyed
a few of their cars.

357
00:16:23,530 --> 00:16:26,852
And yeah, I BM'ed in the
shredder on New Year's.

358
00:16:26,930 --> 00:16:31,458
But I didn't bring the lice in.
That was all Pam.

359
00:16:31,730 --> 00:16:34,051
Attention,
people of the office.

360
00:16:34,130 --> 00:16:38,215
You have exactly 60 seconds
to evacuate the bullpen.

361
00:16:38,290 --> 00:16:39,496
At that time

362
00:16:40,530 --> 00:16:44,296
I will be tossing this
powerful insecticidal grenade,

363
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:48,295
which contains piperonyl
butoxide, as well as...

364
00:16:50,570 --> 00:16:52,015
Dwight? Are you okay?

365
00:16:55,330 --> 00:16:56,331
Whoa...

366
00:16:57,010 --> 00:16:59,058
That butoxide has a mild
hallucinogenic effect,

367
00:16:59,130 --> 00:17:00,734
but I don't think
it's kicked in yet.

368
00:17:00,890 --> 00:17:02,540
I'm going to
count down from 10.

369
00:17:03,050 --> 00:17:05,735
Nine, yellow,

370
00:17:06,730 --> 00:17:10,416
cold, sad, purple...

371
00:17:12,410 --> 00:17:14,890
Wow. He got to purple.

372
00:17:16,810 --> 00:17:17,811
Ow!

373
00:17:18,130 --> 00:17:19,859
Sorry.

374
00:17:22,890 --> 00:17:24,460
You're waterboarding me!

375
00:17:24,610 --> 00:17:25,611
Oops.

376
00:17:35,730 --> 00:17:38,301
No, this is fine.
We're allowed to do this.

377
00:17:39,290 --> 00:17:40,780
This is okay.

378
00:17:44,850 --> 00:17:46,011
Okay, you're UP!

379
00:17:46,130 --> 00:17:48,531
Yeah, I'm actually kind of
sad to see this baby go.

380
00:17:48,930 --> 00:17:51,376
You do kind of
look like Elvis.

381
00:17:51,450 --> 00:17:53,612
But we should probably wash
all the dead lice out.

382
00:17:59,290 --> 00:18:01,019
Okay. Okay

383
00:18:01,090 --> 00:18:02,137
Okay-

384
00:18:06,410 --> 00:18:07,491
Is that too cold?

385
00:18:07,610 --> 00:18:09,897
No, actually,
it feels kind of nice.

386
00:18:20,970 --> 00:18:22,893
I wonder what
happened over there.

387
00:18:23,010 --> 00:18:24,978
I've been sitting
here the whole time.

388
00:18:31,370 --> 00:18:32,974
Oka.
Huh? y

389
00:18:33,050 --> 00:18:35,371
Let's give it a shot.
Let's make it work.

390
00:18:35,530 --> 00:18:37,771
Oh, no. I mean,
I want to, I just,

391
00:18:38,210 --> 00:18:40,781
I don't want to force you into doing
something you don't want to do.

392
00:18:40,850 --> 00:18:44,252
You're not.
I believe in us.

393
00:18:48,530 --> 00:18:51,010
I'm back together
with Val.

394
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:53,775
Yay.

395
00:18:58,370 --> 00:19:00,452
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

396
00:19:00,530 --> 00:19:01,861
Had a pretty
good day today.

397
00:19:03,010 --> 00:19:05,377
Not everything went exactly
according to plan.

398
00:19:05,890 --> 00:19:11,260
But lice, if you're watching, I'm
ready for you anytime, anywhere.

399
00:19:17,010 --> 00:19:19,536
Hey, Erin
already take off?

400
00:19:20,090 --> 00:19:21,455
I guess so.

401
00:19:22,890 --> 00:19:24,096
Okay-

402
00:19:27,490 --> 00:19:28,980
And you're Kareem,
coming to help.

403
00:19:29,090 --> 00:19:30,535
Okay, I'm Kareem.

404
00:19:30,650 --> 00:19:32,459
That makes total sense.
I'm Kareem, you're Dr. J.

405
00:19:32,570 --> 00:19:34,015
Just sounds weird
to say out loud.

406
00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:35,774
And it went
like this.

407
00:19:39,490 --> 00:19:40,855
And that's all.
That's it.

408
00:19:40,890 --> 00:19:43,336
No one will believe this back home,
but that's okay.

409
00:19:43,450 --> 00:19:44,656
That's all right. Let me
show you how to do it.

410
00:19:44,730 --> 00:19:46,095
Yeah, you show
me how to do it.

411
00:19:46,410 --> 00:19:47,775
This is Jim Halpert,
leave a message.

412
00:19:48,930 --> 00:19:51,012
Hey, honey. It's me,

413
00:19:51,130 --> 00:19:53,610
just trying to catch you
before going home.

414
00:19:53,730 --> 00:19:54,731
Um...

415
00:19:55,570 --> 00:19:57,413
Well. Just give
me a call whenever.

416
00:19:57,490 --> 00:19:59,413
Hope your day got
better. Love you.

417
00:20:02,170 --> 00:20:04,571
Hey. What are you
doing right now?

418
00:20:05,170 --> 00:20:06,535
I'm just going
to go home.

419
00:20:06,610 --> 00:20:09,261
My mom's been watching
the kids all day.

420
00:20:09,330 --> 00:20:11,901
Let her stay another hour.
Let's go get a beer.

421
00:20:11,970 --> 00:20:15,531
Really? A beer sounds
incredible right now.

422
00:20:15,610 --> 00:20:18,295
No duh. Let's go,
you're buying.

423
00:20:21,850 --> 00:20:23,534
Meredith, I am so
sorry about today.

424
00:20:23,610 --> 00:20:25,021
Forget about it.

425
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:26,819
I just did not
realize how hard

426
00:20:26,930 --> 00:20:28,694
it was going to
be without Jim.

427
00:20:29,650 --> 00:20:33,018
I mean, I really respect you for
being a single morn all these years.

428
00:20:33,130 --> 00:20:34,939
It whipped my ass
in half a week.

429
00:20:35,930 --> 00:20:37,455
I have to say, there are
not a lot of people

430
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:39,060
who could pull
off a shaved head,

431
00:20:39,130 --> 00:20:40,291
but you are rocking it.

432
00:20:40,450 --> 00:20:41,611
Right?

433
00:20:41,970 --> 00:20:44,291
I got the bartender's phone
number when you were in the john.

434
00:20:44,370 --> 00:20:47,931
I'm going to take that freak to
bone-town before the night is over.

435
00:20:48,530 --> 00:20:50,020
Get it, girl.

436
00:20:55,290 --> 00:20:58,134
This one is for all
you ladies out there!

437
00:21:00,370 --> 00:21:02,134
I come...
Not yet.

438
00:21:04,690 --> 00:21:07,500
I come home
in the morning light

439
00:21:07,570 --> 00:21:12,212
My mother says, "When you going
to live your life right?"

440
00:21:12,450 --> 00:21:15,693
Oh, Mother dear,
we're not the fortunate ones

441
00:21:16,130 --> 00:21:19,339
And girls,
they want to have fun

442
00:21:19,410 --> 00:21:23,495
Oh, girls just
want to have fun
