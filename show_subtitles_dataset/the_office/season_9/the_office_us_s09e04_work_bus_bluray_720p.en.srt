1
00:00:01,570 --> 00:00:03,732
All right, everybody,
great season of softball.

2
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:05,175
I'm super proud
of you guys,

3
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:07,093
and I think you're
going to like this

4
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:08,979
little highlight reel
that I've put together.

5
00:00:09,770 --> 00:00:11,374
GROUP". Dunder Mifflin!

6
00:00:11,690 --> 00:00:12,976
ANDY". Andy Bernard presents,

7
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:15,337
"Summer Softball Epic Fails!"

8
00:00:16,490 --> 00:00:17,491
Fail.

9
00:00:19,130 --> 00:00:20,291
Fail!
That's me!

10
00:00:21,490 --> 00:00:23,015
Fail. Is this like
a blooper reel?

11
00:00:23,170 --> 00:00:25,616
A blooper reel?
What is this, 2005?

12
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:28,297
Do I look like
Bob Saget? Fail!

13
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:31,131
Who's this guy?

14
00:00:32,010 --> 00:00:33,580
â™ª Meow, meow, meow, meow.

15
00:00:33,890 --> 00:00:35,255
Look at him dance!

16
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:36,934
Fail!
Fail.

17
00:00:37,010 --> 00:00:38,660
I deserved that.

18
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:40,095
Do-dee-do-dee-do

19
00:00:41,170 --> 00:00:42,410
That was a triple.

20
00:00:42,490 --> 00:00:45,300
Can't take the fail?
Get out of the fail video!

21
00:00:45,370 --> 00:00:46,451
My pleasure.

22
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:50,376
Hi, I'm Pete!
Puberty is such a drag, man.

23
00:00:50,770 --> 00:00:54,775
And I'm Clark, I like to
eat toilet paper. We fail!

24
00:00:57,010 --> 00:00:58,694
I'd like to take a solemn
moment to remember

25
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:00,295
Jerry in the warehouse,

26
00:01:00,650 --> 00:01:02,414
who passed away this year.

27
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:08,175
Well, that's all, folks!

28
00:01:08,530 --> 00:01:13,058
Ski you later, everybody! Thanks for
a great season.

29
00:01:13,130 --> 00:01:16,532
What was that? That was just normal
video with you making vulgar noises.

30
00:01:16,850 --> 00:01:18,454
Well, I worked with
what I had, Oscar.

31
00:01:18,530 --> 00:01:21,932
Next time do more
fail-ier stuff, okay?

32
00:01:22,490 --> 00:01:24,094
What happened to
that video I sent you?

33
00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:27,538
Oh, that wasn't... That didn't work.
That was not the right...

34
00:01:27,650 --> 00:01:29,618
I think
I've got it right here.

35
00:01:29,690 --> 00:01:31,055
No.

36
00:01:38,330 --> 00:01:39,695
Oh!

37
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:44,491
That was not a fail!

38
00:01:44,570 --> 00:01:45,537
Fail! Fail! Fail!

39
00:01:45,610 --> 00:01:46,691
That was actually
a serious accident

40
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:48,579
that could have resulted
in severe bodily harm.

41
00:01:48,770 --> 00:01:50,374
Fail! Fail! Fail!
You're all failing right now.

42
00:01:50,450 --> 00:01:54,250
Congratulations on your epic fail
of the use of the word "fail!"

43
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:07,251
Oh, God.

44
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:10,817
What's going on?

45
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:12,136
Nothing!
Nothing is going on.

46
00:02:12,410 --> 00:02:13,900
Keep moving, please.
What's he measuring?

47
00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:16,450
Okay, excuse me,
lam the landlord.

48
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:18,977
This is between me and the
management, no one else. Please.

49
00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:22,014
It's an EMF hotspot.
Oh, my God!

50
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:23,576
It stands for
electromagnetic field,

51
00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:25,334
generally caused
by a concentration

52
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:26,935
of wiring in one area,

53
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:30,181
especially if
poorly insulated, Dwight.

54
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:31,691
Um.

55
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:33,772
Okay, I'm just
walking in to this.

56
00:02:34,010 --> 00:02:36,820
Am I to understand there's
a beehive in the wall?

57
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:39,571
You think I have a machine
for measuring beehives?

58
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:41,459
I was just asking
a question, Toby.

59
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:42,895
How are you not
murdered every hour?

60
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:46,381
Well, I'm not getting paid
to work in a microwave oven.

61
00:02:46,690 --> 00:02:49,694
Okay, listen.
Everything here is up to code.

62
00:02:50,050 --> 00:02:52,257
"Oh, the wires
need insulation."

63
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:55,654
It's a wire, people.
I'm not buying it a fur coat.

64
00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:02,136
Thank you.
You got it.

65
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:06,340
Last week, I finally told Pam
about the other job I took in Philly,

66
00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:10,734
the side job, and she was so
incredibly cool about it.

67
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:14,021
And now I just want to do
something huge for her.

68
00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:17,179
Like if we were
in some biker bar

69
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:19,093
and she mouthed
off to some bikers

70
00:03:19,170 --> 00:03:21,935
and they came lumbering over
and I was like... Wham!

71
00:03:22,010 --> 00:03:24,012
"You've got to go
through me first!"

72
00:03:33,210 --> 00:03:34,541
Andy, could I have
a word, please?

73
00:03:34,610 --> 00:03:36,931
It won't take a moment,
it's extremely important,

74
00:03:37,010 --> 00:03:39,331
and it really
has to happen now.

75
00:03:39,770 --> 00:03:41,852
Fine. I will
give you one minute.

76
00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:43,535
Oh, please don't
use the hourglass.

77
00:03:43,610 --> 00:03:45,738
You have one minute
and your minute has begun,

78
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:47,812
and no time will
be added at the end,

79
00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:49,694
even to accommodate
this sentence,

80
00:03:49,770 --> 00:03:52,501
with all of its
baroque dependent clauses

81
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:56,211
and cascading
turns of phrase.

82
00:03:56,810 --> 00:03:58,619
I'm trying
to adopt a baby.

83
00:03:58,690 --> 00:03:59,896
A baby what?

84
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:01,091
A human?

85
00:04:02,050 --> 00:04:05,736
And the agency requires a character
reference from my employer.

86
00:04:06,170 --> 00:04:07,171
Oh.

87
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:09,452
You wouldn't have to do anything.
I'd write the letter myself.

88
00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:11,020
You'd just simply
sign it. So...

89
00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:12,731
Okay-

90
00:04:12,850 --> 00:04:16,855
And fall right into your
plagiarism entrapment scheme?

91
00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:18,900
I don't think so.
It's... No, it's...

92
00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:21,735
And I happen to notice you're
down to about 30 seconds here.

93
00:04:21,810 --> 00:04:22,891
If I could just
convince you that you...

94
00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:24,096
And those sand grains are

95
00:04:24,170 --> 00:04:26,013
tumbling with
fury down the side...

96
00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:27,296
It's not entrapment

97
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:28,860
if I'm writing...
of the hourglass.

98
00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:30,773
Time's up!
Fine.

99
00:04:32,330 --> 00:04:33,741
Sure, I'll read
her letter.

100
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:37,059
And if she tells the truth
about how evil and unfit

101
00:04:37,130 --> 00:04:39,781
to be a mother she is, then,
yeah, I'll sign that.

102
00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:43,261
"Statistical correlations
exist between EMF

103
00:04:43,330 --> 00:04:45,731
"radiation and
various health hazards,

104
00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:49,459
"but mainstream
studies are inconclusive."

105
00:04:49,770 --> 00:04:52,091
That means you
can't make me do squat.

106
00:04:52,410 --> 00:04:53,411
You better fix this!

107
00:04:53,530 --> 00:04:56,659
I already ditched my uterus, and I
ain't losing any more good parts!

108
00:04:56,730 --> 00:04:58,141
You people don't
realize what you're asking.

109
00:04:58,210 --> 00:04:59,894
I'd have to rip
open the walls.

110
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:02,132
We'd have to shut this
place down for a week.

111
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:05,340
A week off,
that'd be great.

112
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:19,376
Hey, if you don't want to teach
me the PowerPoint, just say so.

113
00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:20,531
I don't want to
teach you PowerPoint.

114
00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:21,611
Come on.

115
00:05:21,770 --> 00:05:23,181
Just show me the PowerPoint.

116
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:24,217
Just do the tutorial!

117
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:25,337
You're the tutorial.

118
00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:27,777
No, dude, I'm not.
I'm not the tutorial.

119
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:29,415
You could be.
Mmm-mmm.

120
00:05:31,970 --> 00:05:33,574
What are you doing?

121
00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:35,220
Getting my wife
a week off from work.

122
00:05:35,650 --> 00:05:36,811
You popped one kernel.

123
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:38,781
Awesome, right?

124
00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:43,772
So Creed is that
dude's stepdad?

125
00:05:44,130 --> 00:05:45,416
Correct.

126
00:05:46,490 --> 00:05:49,972
Well, I don't know about the rest of
you, but I'm just going to say it.

127
00:05:50,170 --> 00:05:52,650
I'm nervous.
I have no idea what

128
00:05:52,730 --> 00:05:54,494
health problems this
is all going to cause.

129
00:05:54,610 --> 00:05:56,931
What? Come on.

130
00:05:57,370 --> 00:05:59,099
I'm sorry.
I'm not growing a third arm.

131
00:05:59,290 --> 00:06:00,860
I know what Jim
is trying to do.

132
00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:02,335
He's trying to
get Big Bad Dwight

133
00:06:02,410 --> 00:06:03,900
to shell out for
a huge repairjob

134
00:06:04,010 --> 00:06:06,138
while lucky Jimbo
gets a paid vacation.

135
00:06:06,210 --> 00:06:07,939
Well, sorry, lucky Jimbo.

136
00:06:08,010 --> 00:06:10,251
I can live very
happily in a magnetic field.

137
00:06:10,330 --> 00:06:12,981
Most of my childhood heroes
got their powers that way.

138
00:06:13,930 --> 00:06:16,410
"Side effects of EMF
include headaches."

139
00:06:16,530 --> 00:06:17,770
Had them all my life.

140
00:06:17,850 --> 00:06:19,534
"Breast pain."

141
00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:21,817
No knobbies, no probbies.
Nice try, Jim.

142
00:06:22,130 --> 00:06:23,541
O01'. "infertility."

143
00:06:26,370 --> 00:06:27,371
Yeah, right.

144
00:06:34,850 --> 00:06:35,851
Ah.

145
00:06:36,010 --> 00:06:38,331
There's my popcorn.
Can you just grab that for me?

146
00:06:38,730 --> 00:06:41,017
Keep your snacks on
your side, Jim, idiot.

147
00:06:41,850 --> 00:06:43,261
What the...
What?

148
00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:47,211
Some of these
kernels have crowned.

149
00:06:47,330 --> 00:06:50,379
That's impossible, becausethafs
a brand-new bag...

150
00:06:52,210 --> 00:06:53,780
Oh, my God.

151
00:06:57,050 --> 00:06:58,131
Andy!

152
00:07:02,170 --> 00:07:03,774
I'm going to drive
you up to the lake.

153
00:07:03,850 --> 00:07:06,933
Give you a whole week on the
water, just you, me and the kids.

154
00:07:07,130 --> 00:07:08,973
Can we stop by that
pie stand on the way?

155
00:07:09,050 --> 00:07:12,577
You mean Laverne's Pies Tires Fixed Also?
Yes, we will be doing that.

156
00:07:12,650 --> 00:07:13,776
We'll be getting a dozen.

157
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:15,978
A dozen different pies?
'Cause that means rhubarb.

158
00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:18,496
Why would you say that? I meant
four apple, four blueberry,

159
00:07:18,570 --> 00:07:21,255
two cherry, one peach, one chocolate.
I thought that was implied.

160
00:07:21,330 --> 00:07:22,536
Yeah, okay, then.

161
00:07:22,730 --> 00:07:25,097
Ladies and gentlemen!
I have heard your complaints

162
00:07:25,170 --> 00:07:27,298
and we reached
a settlement.

163
00:07:27,730 --> 00:07:31,098
So, we will be leaving the
office for one whole week.

164
00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:32,491
Nice job.

165
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:35,179
In my contract
it is stipulated

166
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:37,298
that I provide
a temporary workspace.

167
00:07:37,370 --> 00:07:39,372
It will arrive in one hour.
What?

168
00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:42,180
What's this?
Whoa. What?

169
00:07:42,410 --> 00:07:43,457
Bring it in.

170
00:07:43,530 --> 00:07:46,136
Roll into
the future with Work Bus.

171
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:48,935
Say goodbye to
wasteful buildings.

172
00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:52,259
These days a mobile office
isn'tjust for hotshot politicians.

173
00:07:52,330 --> 00:07:54,378
Now anyone can
rent a work bus.

174
00:07:54,450 --> 00:07:58,171
If you've got a parking lot, a work
space is just a phone call away.

175
00:07:58,250 --> 00:08:01,652
In this age of belt-tightening
and less empowered workers,

176
00:08:01,850 --> 00:08:05,172
a work bus is how tomorrow
gets things done.

177
00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:09,696
They're a hundred pack...

178
00:08:09,770 --> 00:08:11,534
No six pack for me.

179
00:08:13,450 --> 00:08:14,815
Six. Yes.

180
00:08:16,090 --> 00:08:17,421
Sorry.
Oh, my God!

181
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:20,251
Ah! Sorry.
Lose weight!

182
00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:22,260
I'm trying, sorry.

183
00:08:25,730 --> 00:08:29,621
Oh, The Pennsylvania Department of
Public Welfare Pre-Adoption Standard.

184
00:08:29,770 --> 00:08:31,977
Oh, of course,
you were adopted.

185
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:36,891
I wish!
No, I made some short lists,

186
00:08:36,970 --> 00:08:38,893
I had a couple of sleepovers,
but I never

187
00:08:39,010 --> 00:08:40,978
managed to get
in the end zone.

188
00:08:41,410 --> 00:08:42,696
I don't know what it was.

189
00:08:43,650 --> 00:08:46,051
Not loveable, maybe.
Oh, well.

190
00:08:46,530 --> 00:08:48,180
Listen, I'm really
struggling with this form.

191
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:51,094
But as you know the system, do
you think maybe you could...

192
00:08:51,170 --> 00:08:53,218
Absolutely. I know exactly
what they want to hear.

193
00:08:53,290 --> 00:08:54,576
I would love to help.

194
00:08:54,650 --> 00:08:56,857
Oh, thank you so much!

195
00:08:57,450 --> 00:08:59,771
Just, don't tell Andy,
becauseâ€œ.

196
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:01,773
He hates me.
Thinks I'm a monster.

197
00:09:01,850 --> 00:09:03,693
Should go back to Loch Ness.

198
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:07,056
Stretch. All right.

199
00:09:07,890 --> 00:09:10,461
How many times do you
need to take a stroll?

200
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:13,540
I... My legs cramp up, okay?
It's a circulation issue.

201
00:09:13,610 --> 00:09:15,339
Boy, I will hammerspank
your rear.

202
00:09:15,410 --> 00:09:17,890
All right, all right, gang.
Let's just settle down.

203
00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:19,051
You're yelling in her face.

204
00:09:19,170 --> 00:09:20,376
It's a medical thing.

205
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:21,821
Just... We good?

206
00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:23,295
I'm good! All right?

207
00:09:23,570 --> 00:09:26,335
I'm so sorry
for all of this.

208
00:09:27,050 --> 00:09:30,816
It's okay. You know what they say,
a change is as good as a rest.

209
00:09:32,090 --> 00:09:33,979
I need to get
to the paper, please.

210
00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:36,011
Oh, God!
Oh!

211
00:09:36,090 --> 00:09:38,013
Ah! Oh, my God!
Are you okay?

212
00:09:38,090 --> 00:09:39,137
All right,
I'll get you a napkin.

213
00:09:39,210 --> 00:09:40,291
Can someone get
napkins, please?

214
00:09:40,370 --> 00:09:43,180
You know what? It's fine. It's fine.
Let me just... It's fine.

215
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:45,218
Pam, I'm really sorry.
I just...

216
00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:48,978
I'm... I'm really
sorry about all that.

217
00:09:52,890 --> 00:09:53,891
Really? Smirking?

218
00:09:55,010 --> 00:09:56,819
What can I say?
I love justice.

219
00:09:56,890 --> 00:09:58,813
You forced me to spend money
on needless repairs.

220
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:00,779
And now you're
locked in a prison bus

221
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:02,818
and your woman
drips with beverage.

222
00:10:02,890 --> 00:10:05,257
Hey, Dwight, I was trying to
do something nice for Pam.

223
00:10:05,330 --> 00:10:07,173
Can you just help me out?

224
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:09,252
Can we maybe take
this thing somewhere?

225
00:10:09,330 --> 00:10:11,981
Or do something to not make
this the worst day ever?

226
00:10:12,050 --> 00:10:14,371
It's not my responsibility to
solve your marriage problems

227
00:10:14,450 --> 00:10:17,294
by spending my money on gas.

228
00:10:19,490 --> 00:10:20,491
Andy!

229
00:10:21,610 --> 00:10:22,896
Yo, Toonces.

230
00:10:22,970 --> 00:10:24,051
You're the boss.
Don't you think

231
00:10:24,130 --> 00:10:25,177
we'd all be
a lot more productive

232
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:27,617
if while we were doing work,
we looked up and saw

233
00:10:27,690 --> 00:10:30,216
the best rural pie
stand in Pennsylvania?

234
00:10:30,290 --> 00:10:31,530
I know
I'd be more productive.

235
00:10:31,650 --> 00:10:32,856
As would I.

236
00:10:32,930 --> 00:10:33,931
No question.

237
00:10:34,010 --> 00:10:36,377
No, no,
this is a work bus.

238
00:10:36,450 --> 00:10:38,293
The wheels are
for transporting

239
00:10:38,410 --> 00:10:40,253
the work space to
and from the work site.

240
00:10:40,330 --> 00:10:41,491
What are you talking about?

241
00:10:41,570 --> 00:10:43,777
You're not the boss.
Andy is. Andy?

242
00:10:44,450 --> 00:10:48,660
Pies!
Pies! Pies! Pies! Pies! Pies!

243
00:10:48,770 --> 00:10:52,456
All right!
The fat people have spoken!

244
00:10:52,970 --> 00:10:54,972
Dwight,
get this bus moving.

245
00:10:57,890 --> 00:11:01,292
Next stop, Laverne's
Pies Tires Fixed Also!

246
00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:03,213
Oh, yes!

247
00:11:07,730 --> 00:11:11,530
So it looks like this work bus was
a pretty good idea after all, huh?

248
00:11:11,690 --> 00:11:13,215
Get your foot
behind the yellow line.

249
00:11:13,290 --> 00:11:14,815
You got it.

250
00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:29,061
Stop.
Come back.

251
00:11:29,130 --> 00:11:30,370
Too late.
Hmm.

252
00:11:30,850 --> 00:11:35,572
Shabooya roll call! Shabooya
yaya, shabooya roll call!

253
00:11:35,650 --> 00:11:37,254
My name is Pam
Yeah?

254
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:38,934
I like to paint
Yeah?

255
00:11:39,010 --> 00:11:40,455
You think you're better?
Yeah?

256
00:11:40,530 --> 00:11:41,531
Oh, no, you ain't!

257
00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:42,611
Roll call!

258
00:11:42,730 --> 00:11:45,779
Shabooya yaya
Shabooya roll call!

259
00:11:46,090 --> 00:11:49,173
Shabooya yaya
Shabooya roll call!

260
00:11:49,290 --> 00:11:50,860
My name is Kevin
Yeah?

261
00:11:50,970 --> 00:11:52,415
That is my name
Yeah?

262
00:11:52,530 --> 00:11:54,453
They call me Kevin
Yeah?

263
00:11:54,530 --> 00:11:55,577
'Cause that's my name

264
00:11:55,650 --> 00:11:56,651
Roll call!

265
00:11:56,730 --> 00:11:59,939
Shabooya yaya
Shabooya roll call!

266
00:12:00,170 --> 00:12:03,379
Shabooya yaya
Shabooya roll call!

267
00:12:12,490 --> 00:12:15,255
Thanks. Playing a little
hookey from work today.

268
00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:19,701
Oh, my God!

269
00:12:21,530 --> 00:12:24,261
Dunder Mifflin
road trip 2012!

270
00:12:24,330 --> 00:12:26,981
Okay, now a serious one.

271
00:12:28,530 --> 00:12:30,339
Hey, where's Dwight?
He should be a part of this.

272
00:12:32,810 --> 00:12:34,733
Has he been acting kind
of weird to you lately?

273
00:12:34,970 --> 00:12:37,450
If by lately you mean
for the last 12 years, yeah.

274
00:12:37,530 --> 00:12:39,134
No, I mean he's sulking.
That's not like him.

275
00:12:39,210 --> 00:12:40,894
He's just mad that
we're all having fun.

276
00:12:41,410 --> 00:12:43,936
Then why isn't he scheming?
Or preparing to avenge?

277
00:12:45,610 --> 00:12:47,897
He's fine.
He's indestructible.

278
00:12:49,930 --> 00:12:51,978
Always say that
a child is "placed"

279
00:12:52,090 --> 00:12:54,331
for adoption,
never "surrendered."

280
00:12:55,130 --> 00:12:56,256
We're not hostages.

281
00:12:57,410 --> 00:12:59,412
Although, I have
considered kidnapping one.

282
00:13:00,410 --> 00:13:01,411
And never say that.

283
00:13:04,090 --> 00:13:07,697
I am so excited thinking about this
child that you're going to adopt.

284
00:13:07,770 --> 00:13:09,818
I wish I could just
wave a magic wand and

285
00:13:09,890 --> 00:13:12,018
make you a parentless
five-year-old again.

286
00:13:12,090 --> 00:13:13,535
I would snap you up.

287
00:13:13,890 --> 00:13:14,891
Oh.

288
00:13:16,970 --> 00:13:19,974
Next stop, pies.
Next stop, pies.

289
00:13:20,290 --> 00:13:23,100
Next stop, pies.
Next stop, pies.

290
00:13:23,530 --> 00:13:25,259
Let's go, driver.

291
00:13:25,330 --> 00:13:28,459
Laverne packs up
the pie wagon at 5:00, so...

292
00:13:28,770 --> 00:13:31,057
At 5:00? That's only
20 minutes from now.

293
00:13:31,730 --> 00:13:34,461
The pie shop
is 13 miles away.

294
00:13:34,970 --> 00:13:38,975
So at 55 miles an hour, that just
gives us five minutes to spare!

295
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:41,059
So, wait.
When pies are involved

296
00:13:41,130 --> 00:13:43,098
you can suddenly do
math in your head?

297
00:13:43,170 --> 00:13:44,171
Well...

298
00:13:44,410 --> 00:13:48,256
Hold on, Kevin,
how much is 19,154 pies

299
00:13:48,570 --> 00:13:50,299
divided by 61 pies?

300
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:53,218
Three hundred
and fourteen pies.

301
00:13:54,970 --> 00:13:56,460
What if it were salads?

302
00:13:56,930 --> 00:13:58,375
Well, it's the...

303
00:14:00,530 --> 00:14:03,295
Carry the four...
In the...

304
00:14:03,410 --> 00:14:04,775
It doesn't work.

305
00:14:04,970 --> 00:14:07,257
I'm sorry to spoil Jim's
fantastic voyage, everyone.

306
00:14:07,330 --> 00:14:08,570
But we're
almost out of gas.

307
00:14:08,930 --> 00:14:12,013
Okay, well, I saw a station about
a mile back, so chop-chop.

308
00:14:12,290 --> 00:14:14,691
That name brand place?
No, forget about it, sorry.

309
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:17,853
The tanks are so big on this
thing, five cents a gallon extra?

310
00:14:18,010 --> 00:14:19,011
It really adds up.

311
00:14:19,130 --> 00:14:21,292
Are you kidding me?
Dwight, come on!

312
00:14:21,490 --> 00:14:23,219
Hey, honey? I don't think
we should push him.

313
00:14:23,290 --> 00:14:25,213
No, I'm going to push him.
You know why?

314
00:14:25,290 --> 00:14:27,941
Because you're getting a pie.
Why? Because you deserve it!

315
00:14:28,010 --> 00:14:30,581
And what is he doing? He's trying to
drive us all around the countryside

316
00:14:30,690 --> 00:14:32,931
looking for gas, because he
knows we won't get there.

317
00:14:33,010 --> 00:14:34,853
- Is that what we want?
- No!

318
00:14:35,170 --> 00:14:36,979
Stop ordering
me around, Jim!

319
00:14:37,170 --> 00:14:38,854
- What do we want?
- Pies!

320
00:14:39,010 --> 00:14:40,694
- When do we want it?
- Pies!

321
00:14:41,210 --> 00:14:42,211
Okay, fine!

322
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:47,178
You win, Jim! You win.

323
00:14:47,290 --> 00:14:49,338
We have been battling for a
long time, but you know what?

324
00:14:49,410 --> 00:14:51,617
You win, because you are the winner.
You are the alpha male.

325
00:14:51,690 --> 00:14:54,375
There you go. Alpha male,
go buy your wife a pie.

326
00:14:54,450 --> 00:14:56,020
Go buy the whole
world a pie!

327
00:14:56,170 --> 00:14:57,695
That's impossible.

328
00:14:59,090 --> 00:15:00,216
Dwight!

329
00:15:00,290 --> 00:15:01,371
What are you doing?

330
00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:03,055
What the hell?
Dwight!

331
00:15:06,130 --> 00:15:08,337
Well, now I don't
even feel like pie.

332
00:15:09,530 --> 00:15:10,531
Wait.

333
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:13,055
No, it's back.

334
00:15:15,530 --> 00:15:18,136
Oh, just drive away. Just...

335
00:15:18,210 --> 00:15:19,735
Phyllis, that's not safe.

336
00:15:19,810 --> 00:15:21,892
Guys, we only have
18 minutes left.

337
00:15:22,050 --> 00:15:25,054
At 61 miles an hour, we're
just going to barely make it.

338
00:15:25,610 --> 00:15:27,135
Go up and check on him.
He's upset.

339
00:15:27,210 --> 00:15:28,860
You know he's doing
all this on purpose.

340
00:15:28,930 --> 00:15:31,297
Please just make
sure he's okay.

341
00:15:32,490 --> 00:15:33,821
And hurry it up,
for God's sake!

342
00:15:33,890 --> 00:15:35,335
They're going to be
out of banana cream.

343
00:15:35,410 --> 00:15:36,536
Banana cream is
the first to go.

344
00:15:36,610 --> 00:15:38,578
We'll be lucky to get
pumpkin at this point.

345
00:15:38,890 --> 00:15:39,891
What?

346
00:15:41,290 --> 00:15:42,291
Dwight?

347
00:15:43,090 --> 00:15:44,501
Why are you such a jerk?

348
00:15:44,570 --> 00:15:46,413
I'm trying to do
something for my wife,

349
00:15:46,490 --> 00:15:47,571
and you keep derailing...

350
00:15:47,650 --> 00:15:48,936
I'm barren, Jim.

351
00:15:50,290 --> 00:15:52,577
What? My trouser hives
are void of honey.

352
00:15:53,090 --> 00:15:56,139
I had congress with Angela,
and the child that she bore

353
00:15:56,210 --> 00:15:57,860
did not issue
from my loins.

354
00:15:58,250 --> 00:16:01,413
I thought I would be a father
and instead I am a eunuch,

355
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:03,934
neutered by my own building.

356
00:16:05,330 --> 00:16:08,095
Is this about the popcorn,
or the X on the ceiling?

357
00:16:08,770 --> 00:16:10,454
Dwight,
that was a prank.

358
00:16:11,450 --> 00:16:14,056
You mean you flooded my building
with dangerous electromagnetic

359
00:16:14,130 --> 00:16:16,337
radiation as a prank?
No.

360
00:16:16,410 --> 00:16:18,378
That's genius. That's the
best prank you've ever done.

361
00:16:18,450 --> 00:16:19,940
Ru take it.

362
00:16:23,810 --> 00:16:24,971
Andy?
Who is it?

363
00:16:26,410 --> 00:16:28,412
Um, is this a good time?
Yeah.

364
00:16:28,490 --> 00:16:31,812
Perfect time, right in the
middle of a rooftop crisis.

365
00:16:31,970 --> 00:16:34,018
Fine, let me read it.
What do we have here?

366
00:16:34,210 --> 00:16:37,180
Okay.

367
00:16:38,650 --> 00:16:41,654
You've made this very easy for me.
It's unsignable.

368
00:16:42,290 --> 00:16:43,291
Oh.

369
00:16:44,290 --> 00:16:46,975
Well, is there something...
It's inaccurate, dishonest,

370
00:16:47,090 --> 00:16:49,172
and in a word, dong water.

371
00:16:50,010 --> 00:16:52,058
Oh, well, perhaps I could
reword some of it to...

372
00:16:52,130 --> 00:16:54,132
Here's the thing. You asked
me to do you a favor.

373
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:56,014
I did it. I read it.

374
00:16:56,090 --> 00:16:58,331
Thank you very much
to me for my time.

375
00:16:59,730 --> 00:17:01,812
Good luck with
your impossible dream.

376
00:17:04,330 --> 00:17:05,820
All right then.

377
00:17:15,370 --> 00:17:17,850
Dwight, sometimes it takes
couples years to get pregnant.

378
00:17:17,930 --> 00:17:20,456
Really? How long did it take
you and Pam to conceive?

379
00:17:20,650 --> 00:17:22,459
That doesn't matter. What
position did you use to conceive?

380
00:17:22,570 --> 00:17:23,617
Okay, I'm not
talking about that.

381
00:17:23,690 --> 00:17:24,737
Regular or
lady-on-her-back?

382
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:26,733
You used lady-on-her-back,
didn't you, freak?

383
00:17:27,010 --> 00:17:28,535
Yuck, gross.
Never mind, Jim.

384
00:17:39,370 --> 00:17:42,772
British women, famously
over-emotional, am I right?

385
00:17:44,370 --> 00:17:46,532
I don't think that's Nellie.
What?

386
00:17:47,610 --> 00:17:48,771
NELLIEI Oh.

387
00:17:48,930 --> 00:17:53,015
Oh, no, no. Look, it's all right, really.
It isn't your fault.

388
00:17:53,890 --> 00:17:57,417
No, no.
You were so kind,

389
00:17:57,890 --> 00:17:59,460
and it isn't
anything to do with you.

390
00:18:01,170 --> 00:18:03,741
Did you ever think that
because you own the building,

391
00:18:03,810 --> 00:18:07,132
everyone in it, we're all
kind of like your children?

392
00:18:07,650 --> 00:18:11,575
You know there's a phrase about
that in German, bildenkinder,

393
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:13,101
used almost
exclusively by childless

394
00:18:13,170 --> 00:18:14,899
landlords to
console themselves.

395
00:18:15,050 --> 00:18:17,940
But now I really
understand it.

396
00:18:19,370 --> 00:18:23,773
Well, now you have a bus full
of real bildenkinder.

397
00:18:23,890 --> 00:18:27,178
Bildenkinder. Okay, and
they're all dangerously close

398
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:28,740
to not getting pie.

399
00:18:29,890 --> 00:18:32,211
And there's only one
guy who can save them.

400
00:18:32,290 --> 00:18:34,054
It's not me.

401
00:18:34,130 --> 00:18:35,211
I agree.

402
00:18:35,330 --> 00:18:36,377
Oh.

403
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:38,775
Hey, how did it go?

404
00:18:38,850 --> 00:18:41,330
It was pretty good, actually.
We bonded, we got to talk...

405
00:18:41,890 --> 00:18:42,891
Oh. Wait, wait, wait!

406
00:18:42,970 --> 00:18:46,019
That's what happens when
you don't get out of the way.

407
00:18:46,090 --> 00:18:47,296
Out of the way!

408
00:18:49,610 --> 00:18:51,339
You feel okay now?
Better than okay.

409
00:18:51,450 --> 00:18:52,815
And you know what, honey?

410
00:18:52,890 --> 00:18:54,938
I'm going to get
you that rhubarb pie.

411
00:18:55,170 --> 00:18:56,251
Well, actually, rhubarb is...
Don't.

412
00:18:56,370 --> 00:18:57,371
the one pie that I...
Don't.

413
00:18:57,450 --> 00:18:59,100
Everybody, hang on!

414
00:19:00,450 --> 00:19:01,451
Oh!

415
00:19:06,210 --> 00:19:07,700
Whoa!

416
00:19:10,610 --> 00:19:14,012
Pie! Pie! Pie! Pie! Pie!

417
00:19:25,850 --> 00:19:26,851
Oh.

418
00:19:27,290 --> 00:19:28,576
I changed my mind.

419
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:30,934
Oh, you signed it?
Yeah.

420
00:19:31,410 --> 00:19:33,253
Not as is, obviously.

421
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:37,140
I made a couple of changes, added
some sentences at the end.

422
00:19:38,730 --> 00:19:40,175
Trust me, it needed it.

423
00:19:41,570 --> 00:19:42,901
But, yeah, whatever.

424
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:53,619
"She's tough in business, but tender
with the people she cares about.

425
00:19:53,690 --> 00:19:55,931
"She'll make a wonderful
mother to any child

426
00:19:56,010 --> 00:19:58,217
"who can
overlook weird accents."

427
00:20:03,090 --> 00:20:05,172
I insult you, Oscar!

428
00:20:05,690 --> 00:20:06,816
What?

429
00:20:06,890 --> 00:20:09,780
I insult you,
to your face!

430
00:20:10,490 --> 00:20:12,731
I don't know what
you're talking about.

431
00:20:12,810 --> 00:20:15,097
Then why don't you
do something about it?

432
00:20:15,570 --> 00:20:16,617
Kevin, are you
trying to get me

433
00:20:16,690 --> 00:20:18,499
to hit you in
the face with my pie?

434
00:20:18,930 --> 00:20:20,420
You don't have the guts,

435
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:25,658
you stupid,
dumb do-do face.

436
00:20:32,690 --> 00:20:33,691
Yes!

437
00:20:34,970 --> 00:20:37,177
Oh, my God,
I'm getting so stuffed.

438
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:43,815
We did it.

439
00:20:44,330 --> 00:20:45,741
You did it.

440
00:20:54,570 --> 00:20:56,493
My name is Andy!
Yeah?

441
00:20:56,570 --> 00:20:58,538
I don't do drugs
Yeah?

442
00:20:58,610 --> 00:21:00,533
Now check the style
Yeah?

443
00:21:00,610 --> 00:21:01,736
Of Flatt and Scruggs!

444
00:21:01,810 --> 00:21:02,891
Yeah

445
00:21:17,770 --> 00:21:21,661
Roll call

446
00:21:21,730 --> 00:21:22,731
What?
