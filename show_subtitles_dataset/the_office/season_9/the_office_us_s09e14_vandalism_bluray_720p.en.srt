1
00:00:01,970 --> 00:00:03,017
Have you seen Darryl?

2
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:04,137
He's around here somewhere.

3
00:00:04,610 --> 00:00:05,611
Hmm.

4
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:09,130
Yeah, Darryl's here.

5
00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:11,696
So's Santa Claus.
It's just a regular Thursday.

6
00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:15,891
Neither guy is here!
And it's Friday!

7
00:00:15,970 --> 00:00:18,701
Welcome to me and
Darryl's world of lies!

8
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:23,658
Nobody knows it yet, but Darryl
already started working in Philly.

9
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:26,616
So now he has to
sneak out of here like the

10
00:00:26,690 --> 00:00:29,773
sneakiest little
sneaky-sneak you ever saw.

11
00:00:32,010 --> 00:00:34,854
And I'm his helper!
It's so fun.

12
00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:39,939
Darryl, meet Bear-yl.

13
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:41,416
How much did
you pay for that?

14
00:00:41,490 --> 00:00:43,174
Nothing.
Won him at the carnival.

15
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:45,019
Spent a ton on tickets,
though.

16
00:00:45,330 --> 00:00:46,331
Drive safe!

17
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:48,578
Everybody knows
I go to Philly.

18
00:00:48,650 --> 00:00:50,778
I've just been using
sick days I saved up.

19
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:54,855
But Erin was so excited about being
sneaky-sneaks, I went along with it.

20
00:00:55,610 --> 00:00:59,012
Darryl,
you are too much!

21
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:01,691
That guy's hilarious.
He's here today.

22
00:01:15,370 --> 00:01:17,896
I've really been putting in
the hours on this mural.

23
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:21,015
And my boss is totally okay with
it, because he's in the Bahamas

24
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:23,577
and has no clue
what anybody is doing.

25
00:01:24,010 --> 00:01:26,138
I'm usually very self-critical.
I hate what I paint,

26
00:01:26,210 --> 00:01:29,180
but I don't know, this time
I feel like it's, um...

27
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:31,139
It's really coming together.
Oh, my God!

28
00:01:33,850 --> 00:01:35,340
You've got to be kidding me!

29
00:01:35,410 --> 00:01:37,731
What is... Are those...
Are those butts?

30
00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:39,371
Huh?

31
00:01:40,410 --> 00:01:43,095
No way. No way!

32
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:49,012
Excuse me, everyone. Is it okay
if I leave early from work today?

33
00:01:49,570 --> 00:01:51,379
It's Phillip's first birthday,
and the Senator

34
00:01:51,490 --> 00:01:53,254
and I are hosting
a party at our house.

35
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:55,419
Oh, cute! So there'll
be a bunch of kids?

36
00:01:55,850 --> 00:01:58,615
No, no children. Our
house is not kid-friendly.

37
00:01:58,930 --> 00:02:00,694
Most of our
furniture is sharp.

38
00:02:01,370 --> 00:02:02,531
Also, ew.

39
00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:05,658
It will mostly be
campaign donors.

40
00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:10,494
Angela, lam prepared
to donate a whopping

41
00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:15,616
$8 to Lipton For America
to have an invitation...

42
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:17,340
No, no. Please.

43
00:02:17,410 --> 00:02:18,457
You know,
actually, none of you

44
00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:20,498
could even really make
the cut for this thing.

45
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:23,817
Which I am so sad about!

46
00:02:26,890 --> 00:02:30,576
Angela. You're going to find out,
so I thought I'd let you know

47
00:02:31,210 --> 00:02:33,975
that, uh,
Robert invited me, too.

48
00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:35,576
What?

49
00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:37,136
He said he wanted
me there for support.

50
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:38,451
I'm...

51
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:40,900
His wife.

52
00:02:41,410 --> 00:02:43,333
Angela's husband
and I are in love.

53
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:45,060
Butas
a politician in this town,

54
00:02:45,130 --> 00:02:48,293
you still need the conventional
blonde wife on your lawn signs.

55
00:02:48,890 --> 00:02:52,372
He is risking everything
to have me there today.

56
00:02:53,850 --> 00:02:55,181
Me!

57
00:02:55,610 --> 00:02:58,580
We agreed that you wouldn't be
seen with him in public.

58
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:01,734
It's humiliating for me.

59
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:07,255
Well, if you get to bring
a stud, maybe I do, too.

60
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:12,577
Hey-
Hey-

61
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:15,017
We are splitting a sublet
on a place near Philly.

62
00:03:15,170 --> 00:03:18,060
Just a couple of grown,
sexy-ass roommates.

63
00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:19,370
And as much as I
miss Pam and the kids,

64
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:22,499
it's, uh, kind of nice to live the bachelor
life again. You know? Let your hair down?

65
00:03:23,130 --> 00:03:25,098
Jim was nice enough
to give me his bedroom...

66
00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:26,410
I'm couching it!

67
00:03:26,490 --> 00:03:29,016
which usually means there
are clothes all over the living room.

68
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:31,253
And this
dude labels his food.

69
00:03:31,330 --> 00:03:35,415
He's the clean one, I'm the messy one.
How much fun is this?

70
00:03:37,970 --> 00:03:40,177
I love Jim. I love that
he hooked me up with a job.

71
00:03:40,770 --> 00:03:44,377
It's just, he uses old
T-shirts as washrags.

72
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:48,857
He doesn't wash his dishes.
Apparently they need to "soak."

73
00:03:50,770 --> 00:03:52,534
He hooked me up with a job.

74
00:03:56,330 --> 00:03:58,981
Attention, everyone! Can I
have your attention, please?

75
00:04:00,210 --> 00:04:01,780
Yeah, I don't know everybody's
name down here,

76
00:04:01,850 --> 00:04:04,012
but whoever did this, will
you please raise your hand?

77
00:04:08,330 --> 00:04:12,460
Hello? This is not over, okay?

78
00:04:13,570 --> 00:04:17,336
I will stay up here all day if I have to.
Is that what you want?

79
00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:30,930
Yeah, I will also come down if I want to.
It's my choice.

80
00:04:33,410 --> 00:04:34,980
PAM".
I don't demand justice often.

81
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:37,018
I'm not like Angela,
who calls a lawyer

82
00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:39,616
every time someone watches a
YouTube video of animals doing it.

83
00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:42,216
But someone should get
fired over this, right?

84
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:45,461
Val's no help.
Andy's gone. Jim's out.

85
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:47,614
I just feel like
I'm on my own here.

86
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:52,696
I mean, okay,
not completely on my own,

87
00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:55,211
but in terms of people
who can do something.

88
00:04:55,290 --> 00:04:56,621
Thank you, Brian.

89
00:04:59,770 --> 00:05:02,501
Hey, so, Wade wants to send
people to the Sloan Conference.

90
00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:04,379
We got to compile
a list of our target clients.

91
00:05:05,290 --> 00:05:08,578
Already on it. I ordered them
by their Google Trend rankings,

92
00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:09,697
so we know who to hit first.

93
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:10,857
Who is this guy?

94
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:12,011
We are killing it.

95
00:05:12,330 --> 00:05:13,855
Yes, sir!
Yeah!

96
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:24,379
Conference room.
Everybody. Now!

97
00:05:25,130 --> 00:05:27,531
You don't have the clearance to
call a conference-room meeting.

98
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:29,055
Yes, but David Wallace does,

99
00:05:29,130 --> 00:05:31,736
and he asked me to gather
everyone to talk about stuff

100
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:34,416
that's gonna be revealed once we're in
the conference room for the meeting.

101
00:05:34,890 --> 00:05:37,291
You're telling me
David Wallace asked you

102
00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:40,221
to call a super-secret, classified
conference-room meeting?

103
00:05:40,290 --> 00:05:41,337
Yeah.

104
00:05:42,730 --> 00:05:44,459
Let's go, everyone!
Super-secret,

105
00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:46,373
classified
conference-room meeting! Now!

106
00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:49,336
Let's go.

107
00:05:51,330 --> 00:05:52,616
I have terrible news.

108
00:05:53,130 --> 00:05:54,700
Somebody defaced my mural.
What?

109
00:05:54,770 --> 00:05:56,499
They painted all over it.

110
00:05:57,130 --> 00:05:58,734
I thought that's
what you were doing.

111
00:05:58,810 --> 00:06:00,574
Yeah, but this is different.
Oh.

112
00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:02,420
They used worse
paint than your paint?

113
00:06:03,490 --> 00:06:04,651
I don't think so.
But they put paint

114
00:06:04,850 --> 00:06:05,976
where I didn't want paint.
So...

115
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:07,654
I thought you wanted paint
on the whole thing.

116
00:06:07,930 --> 00:06:08,977
Different colored paint.

117
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:10,495
I wanted
different colored paint

118
00:06:10,690 --> 00:06:12,135
in the spots where
they put their paint.

119
00:06:12,290 --> 00:06:15,021
So, it just is...
Okay, the point is,

120
00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:17,178
these warehouse
guys are vandals,

121
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:18,376
and they need to be stopped.

122
00:06:18,730 --> 00:06:20,061
Yeah,
and somebody had the balls

123
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:23,373
to put my phone number on the men's
room wall, which is so messed up.

124
00:06:23,490 --> 00:06:25,697
It's 6-7-8-2, not 8-3!

125
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:29,298
Uh, 6-7-8-3 is also
a good time. Less mileage.

126
00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:31,261
Pam, what can be done?

127
00:06:31,570 --> 00:06:33,857
Yes. Thank you!
Let's answer that question.

128
00:06:33,930 --> 00:06:36,934
I was politely saying nothing can be done.
I thought I was clear.

129
00:06:37,170 --> 00:06:39,901
What?
Come on, guys! We need to

130
00:06:40,010 --> 00:06:42,012
figure out who did
this and punish them!

131
00:06:42,690 --> 00:06:47,014
This isn'tjust about me, this is
about all of us. This is our mural!

132
00:06:47,090 --> 00:06:51,732
Don't you see how much we worked on this?
How much time and energy?

133
00:06:51,810 --> 00:06:54,097
We put our heart and
soul into this thing.

134
00:06:54,170 --> 00:06:55,501
David Wallace
called this meeting?

135
00:06:55,610 --> 00:06:56,816
Sure did.

136
00:06:56,890 --> 00:06:58,733
I was as surprised
as you, but apparently

137
00:06:58,810 --> 00:07:00,972
he is very
passionate about public art.

138
00:07:01,850 --> 00:07:05,536
No, no, come on, guys!
Don%go!

139
00:07:05,610 --> 00:07:07,339
Pam? I'll help you.

140
00:07:07,410 --> 00:07:08,411
You Will?

141
00:07:08,490 --> 00:07:11,334
If there's anything I hate
worse than art, it's crime.

142
00:07:11,530 --> 00:07:13,055
Thank you.
lam in too, Pam.

143
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:14,615
Yeah?
Yes, of course!

144
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:17,177
I believe in you,
I believe in your art,

145
00:07:17,290 --> 00:07:18,496
and I am bored.

146
00:07:19,410 --> 00:07:20,377
Great!

147
00:07:20,450 --> 00:07:22,020
I was hoping for
a righteous mob.

148
00:07:22,130 --> 00:07:23,700
I ended up with
Dwight and Nellie.

149
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:26,253
But they both
have a mob mentality.

150
00:07:26,850 --> 00:07:29,251
And I'm pretty sure Dwight
has a pitchfork in his car.

151
00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:32,014
You need my pitchfork?

152
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:37,331
Hey-

153
00:07:37,410 --> 00:07:39,299
What is it?
I have vengeance to exact.

154
00:07:39,370 --> 00:07:42,613
Exciting news. There's room for one
more at my son's birthday event,

155
00:07:42,690 --> 00:07:44,454
and I want you.

156
00:07:44,770 --> 00:07:45,851
Ah! I'm not interested.

157
00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:48,661
Wait, wait! The State Transportation
Secretary will be there.

158
00:07:48,970 --> 00:07:52,019
You could sell your beet-salt
idea to the highway people. Ah!

159
00:07:52,290 --> 00:07:53,780
If I get the de-icing gig,
it's going to be

160
00:07:53,930 --> 00:07:55,455
on merit, not
because I played politics.

161
00:07:58,330 --> 00:08:01,459
Hey. So, a little
birdie just told me that

162
00:08:01,530 --> 00:08:03,771
Dwight can't come to
your son's birthday.

163
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:06,730
So, do you want me to go with you?
No.

164
00:08:06,930 --> 00:08:09,456
Okay, I understand.
I'll just stay here, then,

165
00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:11,419
alone with the money.

166
00:08:12,850 --> 00:08:14,136
Oh, crap.

167
00:08:15,410 --> 00:08:17,458
I am handing out
pieces of paper

168
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:21,694
on which you will draw one human butt.
What I do with said drawings

169
00:08:21,770 --> 00:08:23,295
is no one's
business but my own.

170
00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:25,498
You're going to compare them
to the butts up there.

171
00:08:25,570 --> 00:08:28,460
Incorrect. It is my fetish.
Oh, also, sign them.

172
00:08:28,730 --> 00:08:30,334
My fetish is signed
drawings of butts.

173
00:08:30,650 --> 00:08:32,140
I'm not drawing a butt.

174
00:08:32,210 --> 00:08:33,780
All right, then, no bottoms.

175
00:08:33,850 --> 00:08:37,093
Uh... We should ask you to
do big rounded W's.

176
00:08:37,210 --> 00:08:39,417
Yes, or nippleless breasts,
perhaps.

177
00:08:39,490 --> 00:08:42,096
Okay. Okay, I think it's time to get
back to work. Come on, fellas. Let's go.

178
00:08:42,170 --> 00:08:43,740
Or melons, like cantaloupes,

179
00:08:43,810 --> 00:08:45,699
with,
like, the halves are cut off

180
00:08:45,810 --> 00:08:47,733
and then just
the bottom parts...

181
00:08:47,810 --> 00:08:49,574
Well,
this is getting us nowhere.

182
00:08:49,810 --> 00:08:53,496
We need another approach. We
need to find the weakest one

183
00:08:53,810 --> 00:08:55,733
and separate him
from the group.

184
00:08:57,530 --> 00:09:00,215
Yeah, I think if we could get
Nate alone, we could crack him.

185
00:09:02,010 --> 00:09:03,216
We just need
a pretense to talk to him.

186
00:09:03,290 --> 00:09:04,940
We could tell him
that his mother is dying.

187
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:06,501
That usually works on him.

188
00:09:07,010 --> 00:09:08,136
Nate!

189
00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:10,100
Your mother is dying!

190
00:09:16,530 --> 00:09:19,010
See? I feel bad about that. Good.
That's all right, that's all right.

191
00:09:19,490 --> 00:09:21,060
So she's going to
pull through again?

192
00:09:22,490 --> 00:09:24,333
That's great.
Can I talk to her?

193
00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:26,215
No. She needs her rest again.

194
00:09:26,690 --> 00:09:28,818
Now, listen.
Now that we've got you here,

195
00:09:28,930 --> 00:09:30,659
let's talk about
this mural business.

196
00:09:30,730 --> 00:09:31,970
You know who the vandal is.

197
00:09:32,090 --> 00:09:34,900
Now, I know a lot of these
warehouse guys are your friends,

198
00:09:35,090 --> 00:09:36,899
but we've got chewing gum.

199
00:09:37,730 --> 00:09:39,892
Gum's gotten mintier lately,
have you noticed?

200
00:09:40,210 --> 00:09:42,372
Like,
some of it is just too minty.

201
00:09:42,530 --> 00:09:44,180
It's like they're literally
trying to hurt your mouth.

202
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:46,014
Tell us who
defaced the mural!

203
00:09:46,570 --> 00:09:48,174
He did it.

204
00:09:50,010 --> 00:09:52,377
All right, you can go.
Give him his gum.

205
00:09:52,730 --> 00:09:54,732
There's no gum.
There never was any gum!

206
00:09:57,410 --> 00:09:58,935
That's really rude.

207
00:10:03,730 --> 00:10:06,893
Opening with puff pastries?
That's a bold play.

208
00:10:07,570 --> 00:10:11,291
They're saying, "it's only going to
get better from here? Good luck."

209
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:14,854
That painting is just...

210
00:10:15,530 --> 00:10:18,500
How can anyone that weighs less
than a guinea hen be so terrifying?

211
00:10:19,570 --> 00:10:22,176
Ladies and gentlemen,
Senator and Angela Lipton.

212
00:10:23,970 --> 00:10:25,699
Thanks, everybody,
thanks for coming.

213
00:10:25,770 --> 00:10:28,421
Phillip had no idea
he was so popular.

214
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:33,252
Oh, Robert, you're horrible.

215
00:10:33,370 --> 00:10:35,976
Simon, Maxine,
who let you guys in here?

216
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:39,459
This is the team.

217
00:10:39,850 --> 00:10:41,454
Nice job, man.

218
00:10:41,610 --> 00:10:43,214
You too, Darryl.

219
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:45,811
What?

220
00:10:46,770 --> 00:10:49,535
Oh, man.
I'm sorry about that.

221
00:10:50,210 --> 00:10:51,700
It's cool.
Reading is tricky sometimes.

222
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:55,011
Oh, are you really
mad about this?

223
00:10:55,930 --> 00:10:59,139
That's my go-to thermos, that's all.
Oh, it's your go-to...

224
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:00,820
Oh, man, that's a bummer.
I'm sorry about that.

225
00:11:00,890 --> 00:11:02,051
No big deal, no big deal.

226
00:11:02,170 --> 00:11:03,331
No, if it's a big deal,
it's a big deal.

227
00:11:03,490 --> 00:11:04,855
No, no, no.
No big deal.

228
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:06,659
No, no, no, no, no!
You don't have to do that!

229
00:11:06,770 --> 00:11:08,454
Honestly, I don't mind.

230
00:11:20,530 --> 00:11:21,816
Did want me to
wash it for you, or...

231
00:11:21,970 --> 00:11:23,301
I don't know.
Are you going to wash it,

232
00:11:23,370 --> 00:11:24,895
or you gonna let it soak?

233
00:11:29,490 --> 00:11:30,537
Okay-

234
00:11:32,330 --> 00:11:33,491
Here you go.

235
00:11:33,810 --> 00:11:35,016
Thank you!

236
00:11:37,050 --> 00:11:41,658
So, Frank, do you have any thoughts,
about what was done? By you.

237
00:11:44,010 --> 00:11:46,251
Maybe... Maybe I could get
the ball rolling. Mmm-hmm.

238
00:11:46,570 --> 00:11:47,901
Um, Frank?

239
00:11:48,690 --> 00:11:50,260
Hi. Pam.

240
00:11:50,330 --> 00:11:56,178
Um, lam so sorry if I've
done anything to offend you.

241
00:11:56,650 --> 00:11:58,698
I'm sure it isn't
easy for you guys

242
00:11:58,810 --> 00:12:02,735
to have an upstairs person
coming down in yourspace, so“.

243
00:12:03,770 --> 00:12:06,011
Truly, if... I apologize.

244
00:12:06,490 --> 00:12:09,300
But enough about me.
Your turn.

245
00:12:14,970 --> 00:12:18,213
Insert apology here, Frank?

246
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:21,378
I'm sorry I didn't
like your crappy doodles.

247
00:12:22,210 --> 00:12:25,100
I drew a butt.
Big deal. Butts are funny.

248
00:12:25,850 --> 00:12:27,693
Well, I didn't think
that butt was funny.

249
00:12:27,890 --> 00:12:29,415
Well, maybe if you got
the stick out of yours...

250
00:12:29,490 --> 00:12:30,980
What was that?
You know what?

251
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:35,055
You people can't
fire me, so screw you.

252
00:12:37,970 --> 00:12:41,053
Whoa! Hey! That is not okay!

253
00:12:41,570 --> 00:12:42,981
What are you going
to do about that?

254
00:12:43,090 --> 00:12:44,580
It... Compliment.

255
00:12:44,650 --> 00:12:46,891
The first "sorry"
sounded sincere.

256
00:12:47,090 --> 00:12:51,300
There were two or three sorrys in there.
So it's a lot.

257
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:54,571
Thatsucked.
He didn't apologize.

258
00:12:54,650 --> 00:12:56,095
There's no
talking to that guy.

259
00:12:56,170 --> 00:12:58,650
Oh, your little feelings party
didn't work out, huh?

260
00:12:58,730 --> 00:13:02,212
Who won the hugging contest? No, let
me guess. Everyone tied for first.

261
00:13:02,290 --> 00:13:03,496
We should just take him down.

262
00:13:04,690 --> 00:13:06,055
Wait, are you saying...

263
00:13:06,130 --> 00:13:09,259
I'm saying we should go
scorched-earth on that guy's face.

264
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:14,218
Normally,
I find Pam to be a comforting

265
00:13:14,330 --> 00:13:16,332
if unarousing
presence around the office,

266
00:13:16,410 --> 00:13:18,333
like a well-watered fern.

267
00:13:18,450 --> 00:13:20,930
But today, she has
tapped into this vengeful,

268
00:13:21,010 --> 00:13:24,173
violent side,
and I'm like, "Wow,

269
00:13:24,610 --> 00:13:26,419
"Pam has kind of a good butt!"

270
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:30,173
He messed with something
that was important to you.

271
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:32,093
We need to mess with something
that's important to him.

272
00:13:32,530 --> 00:13:34,373
A little eye-for-an-eye action.
Yes! Yes!

273
00:13:34,450 --> 00:13:36,452
Go all
Hammurabi on this clown.

274
00:13:37,170 --> 00:13:38,501
We need an infiltrator.

275
00:13:40,650 --> 00:13:43,017
I know just
the man for the job.

276
00:13:45,570 --> 00:13:46,776
Clark?

277
00:13:47,210 --> 00:13:48,974
He even looks like a mole.

278
00:13:49,450 --> 00:13:51,896
One of his tee shots can wipe
out a whole owl population.

279
00:13:54,010 --> 00:13:56,138
You two seem very close.

280
00:13:56,530 --> 00:13:58,658
Yes, we're good friends.
Good friends. Yeah.

281
00:13:59,010 --> 00:14:01,138
And I suppose that may
ruffle a few feathers.

282
00:14:01,690 --> 00:14:04,136
Because for a long time,
our party

283
00:14:04,570 --> 00:14:07,016
has turned its back on
the Hispanic people.

284
00:14:07,970 --> 00:14:12,658
Well, that is not who I am. lam a
friend of the Latino community.

285
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:18,256
And if you ask me, it's time
we bid bigotry hasta luego.

286
00:14:20,010 --> 00:14:22,411
Now, does my embrace
of Hispanics make me

287
00:14:22,530 --> 00:14:24,931
more electable,
given demographic trends?

288
00:14:25,010 --> 00:14:26,853
I don't know,
and I don't care.

289
00:14:27,010 --> 00:14:29,138
What I care about is Oscar.

290
00:14:30,010 --> 00:14:33,253
My friend, mi amigo, Oscar.

291
00:14:36,970 --> 00:14:39,655
Maybe I should be insulted
that he only invited me here

292
00:14:40,210 --> 00:14:42,133
to be his token
Mexican friend,

293
00:14:42,490 --> 00:14:45,699
but he could have invited any
number of Hispanics that he knows.

294
00:14:46,210 --> 00:14:49,100
His gardener, Rohelio,
or he could have invited...

295
00:14:50,330 --> 00:14:51,377
Rohelio,

296
00:14:51,450 --> 00:14:52,576
but he chose me.

297
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:57,218
Rohelio's Malaysian.

298
00:14:58,450 --> 00:15:00,214
That son of
a bitch is Malaysian.

299
00:15:05,970 --> 00:15:07,096
Oh, hey.
Hey.

300
00:15:07,650 --> 00:15:09,573
Hey, I usually watch TV during
my lunch break. That's cool?

301
00:15:09,770 --> 00:15:11,181
Yeah, totally.
All right.

302
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:19,581
It's mine, don't worry.

303
00:15:19,770 --> 00:15:20,771
I didn't say anything.

304
00:15:21,050 --> 00:15:22,051
I don't think you had to.

305
00:15:22,770 --> 00:15:23,851
Excuse me?

306
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:27,534
I think you might be going a little
crazy with this labeling thing, man.

307
00:15:27,730 --> 00:15:30,700
I mean, you put your name
on a five-pound bag of flour.

308
00:15:31,610 --> 00:15:34,090
Are you honestly saying that if I
needed flour, I couldn't use that?

309
00:15:34,410 --> 00:15:35,377
What do you need
flour for, Jim?

310
00:15:35,450 --> 00:15:36,451
That's not the point.

311
00:15:36,530 --> 00:15:38,658
What, you making bread?
No, I'm not making bread.

312
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:39,777
What bread you making?
Pumpernickel?

313
00:15:39,850 --> 00:15:41,261
Darryl, it doesn't matter.
Darryl! I think you know

314
00:15:41,330 --> 00:15:42,331
the point I'm trying to make!

315
00:15:45,530 --> 00:15:47,055
All right, I'm being ajerk.

316
00:15:48,490 --> 00:15:50,777
You got me this job.
I should be grateful.

317
00:15:51,930 --> 00:15:55,412
I am, I just... You know, I get a little
finicky about my stuff. That's all.

318
00:15:57,090 --> 00:16:00,253
It's all good.
Are we all good?

319
00:16:01,050 --> 00:16:02,290
We good.

320
00:16:04,570 --> 00:16:05,935
What's that cooler?

321
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:07,535
Nothing. It's mine.

322
00:16:15,650 --> 00:16:17,300
What happened to
my Tavis Smileys?

323
00:16:18,130 --> 00:16:19,939
Oh, crap, were those yours?

324
00:16:20,290 --> 00:16:21,451
I never want to
see you working

325
00:16:21,530 --> 00:16:24,500
in the upstairs office again!
Do you hear me?

326
00:16:25,570 --> 00:16:28,540
But my only crime was
loving the local sports teams

327
00:16:28,610 --> 00:16:30,100
and trying to be
one of the guys!

328
00:16:30,170 --> 00:16:32,901
Silence! You will now be
working in the warehouse

329
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:34,854
with the untouchables.

330
00:16:35,090 --> 00:16:37,775
Now, go make your
hands rough with work!

331
00:16:38,210 --> 00:16:39,655
Okay, boss!

332
00:16:40,210 --> 00:16:42,053
Pam, you know this is
ridiculous, right? Okay.

333
00:16:42,130 --> 00:16:43,973
You're smarter than this.

334
00:16:44,610 --> 00:16:45,850
This is never going to work!

335
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:47,291
Remember your lines.

336
00:16:47,410 --> 00:16:49,378
What lines?
Go move some paper!

337
00:16:51,330 --> 00:16:53,173
Hey, you know that guy Frank
who works in the warehouse?

338
00:16:53,570 --> 00:16:55,060
He's not my hire,
but I know who he is.

339
00:16:55,130 --> 00:16:57,019
Okay, what is he like?
What's important to him?

340
00:16:57,090 --> 00:16:59,616
Does he have, like, a favorite pair
of boots, or a lunch box, or...

341
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:01,972
What, is he retiring? You getting
him a gift or something?

342
00:17:02,290 --> 00:17:03,291
Yeah, something like that.

343
00:17:03,370 --> 00:17:04,781
I know he loves
his pickup truck.

344
00:17:04,850 --> 00:17:06,181
Oh, great! His truck!

345
00:17:06,490 --> 00:17:08,413
Great, get the plate number.
Okay, do you know the plate...

346
00:17:08,490 --> 00:17:10,094
Never mind.
Why would you know that?

347
00:17:10,170 --> 00:17:11,501
And why would I
be asking that?

348
00:17:11,650 --> 00:17:13,015
So we know which truck to...

349
00:17:13,090 --> 00:17:14,376
Hey,
while I got you on the phone,

350
00:17:14,530 --> 00:17:17,977
your husband is like a sloppy
homeless hobo. Can you fix that?

351
00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:20,298
Yeah, I was kind of hoping you could.
I got to go, bye.

352
00:17:21,010 --> 00:17:22,171
Come on.

353
00:17:26,690 --> 00:17:31,093
Hold on a second. Uh, Sundeep, let's
get you closer to the Senator.

354
00:17:31,170 --> 00:17:32,934
Just about there. Great.

355
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:34,933
And Oscar,
I'm going to need you to step

356
00:17:35,050 --> 00:17:36,973
a little closer to
the Senator as well.

357
00:17:37,090 --> 00:17:38,933
Somewhere there.
He's blocking me.

358
00:17:39,050 --> 00:17:40,256
It's only a photo, honey.

359
00:17:40,370 --> 00:17:41,576
Excuse me, what's your name?

360
00:17:41,650 --> 00:17:42,936
Shawn.
Lashawn, great.

361
00:17:43,010 --> 00:17:45,456
You want to be in a photo?
Right this way. Not you.

362
00:17:45,530 --> 00:17:47,020
No, he put me here.

363
00:17:47,090 --> 00:17:48,615
He put you right in front of me?
Yes, he did.

364
00:17:48,690 --> 00:17:49,930
He put you right in front of me?
Yes!

365
00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:54,459
Now, let's just wheel Margaret
right in front here. Ow!

366
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:57,775
Oscar. Angela.
Robert...

367
00:17:57,930 --> 00:17:59,261
Smile!

368
00:18:01,690 --> 00:18:03,055
I'm done. What are you...

369
00:18:03,690 --> 00:18:05,374
lsthatsupposed
to be my mural?

370
00:18:06,050 --> 00:18:08,098
Yeah. Frank draws
a butt on your mural,

371
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:11,060
I'm drawing your mural
on Frank's truck's butt.

372
00:18:11,330 --> 00:18:12,741
Eye for an eye, mamacita.

373
00:18:12,890 --> 00:18:14,380
Oh,
Dwight, that's really sweet.

374
00:18:14,810 --> 00:18:17,859
Let's see yours. Oh, no, I'm embarrassed.
It's stupid.

375
00:18:18,490 --> 00:18:20,891
This is amazing!
That's Frank!

376
00:18:21,330 --> 00:18:24,015
And he's leaving
a trail of poops?

377
00:18:24,170 --> 00:18:26,411
Yeah.
And he has saggy boobs.

378
00:18:27,090 --> 00:18:28,535
Yeah, I saw that.
That's great!

379
00:18:28,810 --> 00:18:30,380
I feel better.

380
00:18:30,810 --> 00:18:32,653
Good,
I'm glad you feel better.

381
00:18:32,770 --> 00:18:34,932
This has been a wonderful day.
I have to say,

382
00:18:35,330 --> 00:18:37,094
I like hanging out
with a vengeful bitch.

383
00:18:37,570 --> 00:18:39,971
I know.
You miss Angela, don't you?

384
00:18:40,170 --> 00:18:42,571
Don't sympathize. You're
ruining the mood. Back to work!

385
00:18:43,810 --> 00:18:45,335
Draw his penis!

386
00:18:48,050 --> 00:18:51,099
I got back at Frank in the
most fitting way possible.

387
00:18:51,170 --> 00:18:52,660
With my art.

388
00:18:53,450 --> 00:18:54,611
You know,
the paints are water-based,

389
00:18:54,730 --> 00:18:55,856
it's going to
come off with a hose,

390
00:18:55,930 --> 00:18:57,011
but I think
the lesson will last a...

391
00:18:57,130 --> 00:18:58,211
Lady!

392
00:18:58,330 --> 00:19:00,776
My truck? You had no right!

393
00:19:00,850 --> 00:19:02,261
No, you had no right!

394
00:19:02,330 --> 00:19:04,492
It's a $40,000 truck!

395
00:19:04,570 --> 00:19:05,731
So? You started it!

396
00:19:05,810 --> 00:19:07,494
So? So somebody
needs to shut you up!

397
00:19:07,570 --> 00:19:09,095
BRIA. N. Hey, hey, hey! Ah!

398
00:19:09,450 --> 00:19:10,451
Whoa!

399
00:19:10,850 --> 00:19:12,659
- Easy!
- Son of a bitch!

400
00:19:12,730 --> 00:19:13,777
Guys!

401
00:19:13,970 --> 00:19:15,051
You're going to hit a woman?

402
00:19:18,370 --> 00:19:19,417
Thanks so much for coming.

403
00:19:19,490 --> 00:19:20,537
Thank you so much.
Thank you.

404
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:22,696
Well!

405
00:19:23,930 --> 00:19:26,012
Have we all calmed down yet?

406
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:27,775
Yes. Sorry about that.

407
00:19:27,970 --> 00:19:29,654
It was all my fault.

408
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:31,899
Let's all try to
do better next time.

409
00:19:32,130 --> 00:19:33,620
Kevin, great to see you.

410
00:19:33,730 --> 00:19:35,141
Yeah. Thank you for the food.

411
00:19:35,210 --> 00:19:36,371
Oh, and also,

412
00:19:36,450 --> 00:19:37,611
you suck.

413
00:19:38,490 --> 00:19:39,491
I beg your pardon?

414
00:19:39,610 --> 00:19:42,375
You're,
like, a terrible person.

415
00:19:42,770 --> 00:19:47,173
These guys care about you,
and you're just using them.

416
00:19:48,610 --> 00:19:51,819
Again, the food was very good.

417
00:19:59,690 --> 00:20:01,294
Well, I'm going to say
something to the producers.

418
00:20:01,370 --> 00:20:03,259
No, no. It's...
You shouldn't be fired.

419
00:20:03,450 --> 00:20:04,975
I mean,
you were just protecting me.

420
00:20:05,050 --> 00:20:07,417
It's all good. I knew
what I was doing. It's...

421
00:20:07,490 --> 00:20:09,413
I'm sorry about your mural, though.
I mean, because...

422
00:20:09,490 --> 00:20:10,821
Oh, no.
You put so much into that.

423
00:20:10,890 --> 00:20:12,096
Forget about my mural.
It's stupid.

424
00:20:12,210 --> 00:20:13,496
No, you worked hard on that.

425
00:20:13,610 --> 00:20:16,295
That guy's an animal. I'm
glad they're firing him, too.

426
00:20:17,370 --> 00:20:18,531
This is crazy.

427
00:20:19,330 --> 00:20:20,775
Brian, I'm so sorry.

428
00:20:20,850 --> 00:20:22,011
Look“.

429
00:20:23,010 --> 00:20:26,093
I don't... I don't want to put
myself where I don't belong.

430
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:30,855
If you ever need me, you just call
me and I'll be there for you.

431
00:20:32,650 --> 00:20:34,175
Thanks, Bflan.

432
00:20:34,970 --> 00:20:36,096
See you.

433
00:20:53,050 --> 00:20:55,621
Wow. This whole Philly
thing has been so much fun

434
00:20:55,890 --> 00:20:58,655
that I may have lost sight
of what really matters.

435
00:20:59,650 --> 00:21:01,334
I mean, having fun is
not nearly as important

436
00:21:01,410 --> 00:21:03,731
as being good to the people
who you really care about.

437
00:21:04,330 --> 00:21:06,571
I mean,
that's just Roommates 101.

438
00:21:07,010 --> 00:21:08,933
Oh! Come on!
Oh!

439
00:21:09,210 --> 00:21:10,735
Oh!
Damn!

440
00:21:11,450 --> 00:21:12,690
"You Win!"

441
00:21:19,730 --> 00:21:21,459
How good did that feel? That
felt really good, actually.
