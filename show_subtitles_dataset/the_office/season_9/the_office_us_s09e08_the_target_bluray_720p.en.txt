1
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:07,864
Yesterday, Angela may or may
not have figured out that

2
00:00:07,940 --> 00:00:09,544
lam having an affair
with her husband.

3
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:11,981
So I just have
to wait and see

4
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:14,541
when she comes in,
if she's cold and awkward

5
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:17,908
and cruel to me, then great,
it's business as usual.

6
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:24,309
Good morning.

7
00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:31,381
Oscar.

8
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:37,549
Can I ask you
a question?

9
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:41,666
Of course, ask me a...
Questions.

10
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:44,229
Is it cool in here
to you?

11
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:50,386
Yes, a little bit. Yes!

12
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:52,385
I think that thermostat
is acting up again.

13
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:53,911
It's the stupid
thermostat!

14
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:58,304
That thing's a catastrophe.
So, I'm going to...

15
00:00:58,380 --> 00:01:00,986
on your suggestion, get someone
to fix it! I'll just go downstairs.

16
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:02,621
Thank you.

17
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:03,821
No, thank you, Angela.

18
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:07,791
She doesn't know.
I shouldn't be surprised.

19
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:11,148
This is a woman who married a man
who is obviously a homosexual.

20
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:13,427
Basically she has
her head in the sand.

21
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:18,903
In a way I feel sorry for her. I guess
the universe rewards true love.

22
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:33,063
Well,
it's finally happened.

23
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:34,869
Pam has ceased caring.

24
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:38,505
These are my painting clothes.

25
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:41,501
I think I'm going to do it.
lam really going to start

26
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:43,389
painting the warehouse
mural today.

27
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:45,667
Sure you don't want to put another
coat of primer on that, Pam?

28
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:47,344
Queen of the primer,
that one.

29
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:49,184
You got this, Beesly.

30
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:52,184
Actually, do you want me to come
down and help you get started?

31
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:53,500
Are you avoiding
your phone call?

32
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:56,186
What? Yeah, right. As if.

33
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:58,790
Today I will be
asking David Wallace

34
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:00,345
if I can start
working part-time,

35
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:02,422
because the sports marketing
company that I started

36
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:04,343
really needs me
to be there.

37
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:08,311
Last week, Jim wasn't there and
they named the company Athlead.

38
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:11,106
I could have
prevented that.

39
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:13,148
So, lhaveto
talk to Wallace.

40
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:15,467
Tell them your opening line.

41
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:17,742
Hey, David? How'd you like a
guy who's not here as much,

42
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:19,709
gets paid the same
amount of salary

43
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:21,942
and has bigger fish
to fry in Philadelphia?

44
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:25,309
I think it's good.
He likes fishing.

45
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:27,144
This is going
to be awful.

46
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:32,542
One of myjobs is to input customer
complaints into the computer.

47
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:36,107
And when they're in,
I fill out one of these cards.

48
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:38,308
But the information's
already on the computer.

49
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:41,304
So, why am I
filling out the card?

50
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:45,309
I asked Andy and he
told me to chillax.

51
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:48,147
And then went away
on a big, long boat ride.

52
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:50,222
So here we are.

53
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:52,025
Don't give me
a pointless office chore,

54
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:55,229
because I will build
a little paper house.

55
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:57,989
Fight the power.

56
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:06,302
Meet me in the old place.
Five minutes. I need you!

57
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:18,870
Come on in,
the water's fine.

58
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:22,629
Dwight, it's not that kind of meeting.
Put your clothes back on!

59
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:25,540
I know.
That's not why I'm naked.

60
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:28,628
I always work out
without my clothes.

61
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:31,749
Just put them on!
Put on your clothes.

62
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:35,981
I need your help. I need someone who
can operate outside of the law.

63
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:40,467
I'm sorry, your vigilante privileges
ended when you broke up with me.

64
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:43,111
If I'm not in your panties,
I don't go vigilantes.

65
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:44,870
Why don't you
ask your husband?

66
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:46,704
My marriage is in danger.

67
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:49,181
I don't know who I can trust.

68
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:51,388
I need someone
to be there for me.

69
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:55,623
All right, what are we talking,
surveillance, wire-tapping?

70
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:56,906
Something like that.

71
00:03:56,980 --> 00:03:58,550
Yeah. The less
I know the better.

72
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:01,226
I know just the guy. He was
a volunteer sheriff, too.

73
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:02,626
Kicked off the force.

74
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:04,065
Can you arrange a meeting?

75
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:05,545
I can try.

76
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:09,386
I'm going to use SMS text.
Okay.

77
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:11,987
The text went through.

78
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:13,181
Okay-

79
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:14,307
All we can do
is sit and wait.

80
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:15,381
Okay-

81
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:16,701
Oh!

82
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:20,905
Look at that. Yeah, he's free any time.
Not a problem.

83
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:24,902
I mean, I can handle any
client issues from Philly.

84
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:29,144
Yeah, but I really need someone
in the office, if there's a crisis.

85
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:30,460
The more I think about it...

86
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:31,820
You mean handle it
in person?

87
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:34,585
Well, Phyllis
and Stanley have agreed

88
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:36,389
to cover for me
while I'm gone.

89
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:38,428
They did?
Yep.

90
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:43,104
Okay. Well, that is different. In
that case, yes, maybe this can work.

91
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:44,421
Great!

92
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:46,105
Why should we help you?

93
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:47,790
Because we are friends.

94
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:49,550
When is my birthday?

95
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:51,270
Unfair.
When's my birthday?

96
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:53,308
I don't know,
because we're not friends.

97
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:57,067
How about this? You let me take
you to lunch and I make my case.

98
00:04:57,140 --> 00:04:59,063
Now we're talking.
All right.

99
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:00,266
Yeah.

100
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:04,511
Make it go taller.

101
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:06,385
Thafstheidea.

102
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:10,624
No, not taller this way,
taller this way.

103
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:13,989
Well, I've got to build a wider
base first before I can go higher.

104
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:18,783
You're not getting this, Peter.
Make it go wider, up.

105
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:21,860
Will do.

106
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:23,910
What are y'all doing?

107
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:26,028
Me and Pete are
building a tower.

108
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:28,507
Cool. It should be
taller though, right?

109
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:30,230
Obviously.

110
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:36,104
He's a sweet kid, Darryl, but not
the sharpest guy in the drawer.

111
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:39,743
Kevin, I can hear you.

112
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:41,421
Uh-huh.

113
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:47,990
Ow! Dwight! God.
Get in the van.

114
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:53,140
Is it safe to talk?

115
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:56,111
Well, this documentary crew has
been following our every move

116
00:05:56,180 --> 00:06:00,344
for the past nine years, but I don't
see them, so I think we're good.

117
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:04,068
So. What are
your credentials?

118
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:06,906
I started following people
around to get exercise.

119
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:08,869
Turns out
I'm damn good at it.

120
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:10,784
Do you have a gun?

121
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:13,068
Does he own a gun?
Show her.

122
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:15,911
You tell me.

123
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:19,590
What is this?

124
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:21,708
That's the receipt
for my gun.

125
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:23,788
You don't carry it
with you?

126
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:27,023
Read the receipt.
That's a $300 gun.

127
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:28,621
Someone could steal it.

128
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:29,826
You have any idea
how many guns

129
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:31,066
Trevor has had
stolen from him?

130
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:32,381
Now I keep it in a safe.

131
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:34,271
A good safe?

132
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:36,031
You tell me.

133
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:39,461
Wow!

134
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:54,825
I guess if I make a mistake,

135
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:58,143
I can just paint over it
with a shrub or something.

136
00:06:58,220 --> 00:07:00,905
It's just I think less of
paintings with a lot of shrubs,

137
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:04,348
so I'm going to limit
myself to one shrub.

138
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:06,581
You paint wall now?

139
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:10,063
Yeah! Painting now.

140
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:12,429
I just want to
make sure that...

141
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:14,747
You paint now?

142
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:17,302
I mean, it's probably going
to be a few minutes,

143
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:20,145
so you can just go back to
doing whatever you were doing.

144
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:22,826
I wait.

145
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:26,743
Sweet!
Yay!

146
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:30,867
This next card comes to us
thanks to Meredith Palmer,

147
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:35,264
who called Eastern Pennsylvania
Seminary a, quote, "sausage factory."

148
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:36,341
Oh!

149
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:41,266
All right.

150
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:44,590
Up next, we got
a whole lot of Creed.

151
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:46,947
Let's find out what I did.
All right.

152
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:51,547
You get half now and you get half
upon completion of said job.

153
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:53,071
And it's all
off the books?

154
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:54,381
Obviously.

155
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:55,950
Nice. No taxes.

156
00:07:56,940 --> 00:08:00,069
Okay. So, everything you need to
know about the target is in here.

157
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:01,791
So, what's the job?

158
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:04,701
Murder.

159
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:07,586
Okay. That's the big one.
That's the big

160
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:11,706
You can't have
someone murdered!

161
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:13,231
What if they deserved it?

162
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:14,745
What did they
do to you, Angela?

163
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:16,305
They're sleeping
with my husband!

164
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:19,300
Monkey. I feel for you.

165
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:20,911
This seems a little crazy.

166
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:22,385
Yes, crazy! Thank you.

167
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:23,541
But I think I'm up for it. No!

168
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:25,748
Thank you!
No, absolutely not.

169
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:27,151
There are a lot of different
ways to get revenge.

170
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:30,588
I've had great success by defecating in
a paper bag, putting it on the porch.

171
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:31,661
That's very effective.

172
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:33,981
I've been on the receiving end
of that quite a few times.

173
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:36,831
It's devastating. No, no, no,
it has to be physical.

174
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:38,106
I want this person
to suffer.

175
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:39,421
What about a knee-capping?

176
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:41,468
No! You're not helping,
Trevor.

177
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:43,503
Yes! A knee-capping
could work.

178
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:46,630
No! Angela!
What are you saying?

179
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:48,424
You said you would
be there for me.

180
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:50,662
I'm trying,
but what you're asking is...

181
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:53,869
It's the only thing
that will make this right.

182
00:08:56,140 --> 00:08:58,825
Okay. But it's cruel,

183
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:01,710
because a woman with damaged
knees can't scrub worth a damn.

184
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:05,309
All right, then it's
settled, one knee-capping.

185
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:09,785
Now, the hit goes down at 4:00.
Keep in mind, once I leave,

186
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:11,191
there's no turning back.

187
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:15,187
You know, truth be told, I
think all you'll really be doing

188
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:17,462
is accepting calls from my
clients while I'm gone.

189
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:20,146
We've got all afternoon
to talk about that.

190
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:21,267
Morning, folks.

191
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:24,702
I'll have the surf and turf,
with a side order of lobster.

192
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:27,188
Actually the surf and turf
does come with lobster.

193
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:29,183
Not enough lobster.
Side order.

194
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:31,348
How much wine do you have?

195
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:34,909
I brought you a cookie.

196
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:37,950
Thanks, Oscar,
you're such an angel.

197
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:54,140
I just gave her a cookie,
and she called me an angel,

198
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:56,507
so, yeah, we're good.

199
00:09:56,580 --> 00:10:00,301
Yeah, we dodged a bullet.

200
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:02,621
Yes, okay. Yeah.

201
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:05,863
Yeah, well, I got to go now, but, okay.
Bye. Bye.

202
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:08,264
There we go!

203
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:11,501
Nicely done, very nicely done.
Nice.

204
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:15,869
All right, this next one goes to
Darryl for pocket-dialing a customer

205
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:17,146
while having sex.

206
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:18,461
Oh!

207
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:20,744
You salty dog.

208
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:23,790
Well, you know. What can I say?
Player's got to play.

209
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:24,861
There you go.

210
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:28,183
Actually that was the sound
of me eating spaghetti,

211
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:30,740
but I'm going to let them
think the other thing.

212
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:32,783
Okay, I got this one.

213
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:34,749
Be careful!
Be careful!

214
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:36,629
Easy does it, everyone.

215
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:39,580
Nobody even take a breath.

216
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:41,469
Kevin, don't.

217
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:47,104
Kevin! What did I say? What did I just say?
Look at that...

218
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:50,463
Hey, hey, hey! It's just a mistake.
It's just a mistake.

219
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:52,781
That's what this tower
is all about. Mistakes.

220
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:57,068
Okay? If you're afraid of screwing
up, this tower's not for you.

221
00:10:57,140 --> 00:11:00,906
Show of hands, who here has never
had a complaint? That's right.

222
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:04,669
Nobody! See that? Nobody.

223
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:08,187
Okay? Let's get back
to work.

224
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:10,745
Come on. You in?

225
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:12,911
Yeah!
Yeah.

226
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:15,108
There we go.
All right, let's do it.

227
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:18,510
You know,
at the end of the day,

228
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:20,105
it's really only
two days, remember.

229
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:21,705
I mean, I'll be
back at the office,

230
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:23,623
and if you need me for
an emergency, call me.

231
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:26,385
You know what? I don't
know where the years went.

232
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:31,141
Because sometimes when I look at my
hands, I don't even recognize them.

233
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:33,707
Tell me about it.
Whose hands are these?

234
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:36,062
They're not my hands. Oh, no.

235
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:39,110
All right. You know what? Maybe
we'll just... We'll go slow.

236
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:40,511
No, Jim.

237
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:43,988
All right! Check it out. Yes!

238
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:46,427
Like a phoenix
from the ashes!

239
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:50,671
Nice. Pretty soon, we're
going to be at the ceiling.

240
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:53,543
Can you hand me a card?

241
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:55,906
It's empty-

242
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:57,511
What?
What?

243
00:11:57,580 --> 00:11:58,945
Come on,
we could use a blank card.

244
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:00,146
No!
No!

245
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:01,381
That's cheating!

246
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:02,746
I could get us a complaint.

247
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:07,306
You? Little Miss Priss? You
wouldn't fart on a butterfly.

248
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:10,391
No, lwouldn't. I can't even
relate to that impulse.

249
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:14,707
But I bet I can get us a customer
complaint and I'd like to try.

250
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:18,906
Yeah! Go Pam!
All right.

251
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:22,462
Pam! Pam! Pam!
Pam! Pam! Pam!

252
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:24,110
Go, Pam! Go, Pam!

253
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:25,790
Pam! Pam! Pam!

254
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:27,066
Hey Kevin, let's...

255
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:28,341
Pam! Pam! Pam!

256
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:30,661
What? Why did you
call me out here?

257
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:33,505
The target.
It's Oscar, isn't it?

258
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:36,142
He and the Senator
are gaying each other.

259
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:38,506
I don't know what
you're talking about.

260
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:40,184
Your nostrils tell
a different story.

261
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:42,911
They flare like that every time
you're engaging in deception.

262
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:44,625
Hello again,
naughty nostrils.

263
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:47,541
Fine, it's Oscar! So what?

264
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:50,909
Well, I could understand you wanting
to get a stranger's knees whacked,

265
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:53,182
but a co-worker,
dare I say a friend?

266
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:57,106
Exactly, a friend, someone who
sits next to you, year after year,

267
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:58,750
making chit chat
and smiling.

268
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:01,983
And all the while running behind your
back, and defiling your marriage,

269
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:03,585
and seducing
your husband!

270
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:07,427
I can't even imagine how
painful this must be for you.

271
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:12,180
But the first ones to break your
marriage vows were you and me!

272
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:16,703
Well, you might be right.
But it's too late now.

273
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:18,307
What do you mean?

274
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:19,541
He's here.

275
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:24,346
No! No, no, no!

276
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:33,027
Oscar? Oscar! Oscar, good! Listen!
Hey, come with me!

277
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:34,551
What?
Come with me!

278
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:35,781
What are you doing?

279
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:37,146
There are a bunch of
construction workers

280
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:38,790
in the warehouse without their trousers...
I'm working.

281
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:40,544
drinking diet sodas.

282
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:43,464
You have got to see this.
They're extraordinary.

283
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:45,030
Yahtzee!

284
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:54,907
Sandwich delivery
for Mr. Oscar Martinez.

285
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:01,141
I am Oscar Martinez.

286
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:04,907
No, not him, outside!
Outside!

287
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:08,181
What, what?

288
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:09,990
You know there's
donuts in the break room?

289
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:11,471
Nice!

290
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:15,270
Listen, I was
really wondering if maybe

291
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:17,030
we could lock this down
before lunch is over.

292
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:18,909
Don't be pushy, Jim.
It's tacky.

293
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:20,181
All right.

294
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:22,740
Phyllis! Phyllis!
That's decorative.

295
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:23,981
No, there's wine in here.

296
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:25,226
It's still decorative.

297
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:26,586
Is it white wine?
Nope.

298
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:28,185
Dude, hey, can you help me?

299
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:30,103
Don't poke people
with knives!

300
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:31,901
Ph u" u
y '8

301
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:33,181
Wow!

302
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:34,870
Bring it over.
Got it.

303
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:38,222
There's no time
to explain!

304
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:43,228
Dwight... Okay, actually
there is time to explain.

305
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:45,507
When Angela found out
that you seduced her husband,

306
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:47,105
we hired a guy
to break your kneecaps.

307
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:49,069
My God!
What is wrong with you?

308
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:51,103
What is wrong with you?

309
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:52,745
There are
a million gorgeous guys

310
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:54,464
in the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre
area,

311
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:56,588
and you choose the man who
is the father of her child?

312
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:58,668
I don't know what you're talking about.
Oh, don't lie!

313
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:01,903
I'm trying to save those precious
knees you're always bragging about!

314
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:04,830
Now let's get out of here!
He could be right behind us!

315
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:08,189
Actually,
he's right in front of us!

316
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:10,547
Let's get it on.
I'm going to do this.

317
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:13,100
I might... I might puke,
but I'm going to do this.

318
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:15,103
No, Trevor.
I'm not going to let you.

319
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:17,188
He's a Dunder Mifflin man.
He's my tribe.

320
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:20,509
Sorry, Dwight, but for once
in my stupid, stupid life,

321
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:22,184
I'm going to follow through on something.
All right?

322
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:24,024
I have masculinity issues,
lhave“.

323
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:26,148
Stop! No!
Qkav-I got it!

324
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:28,029
Disarm!
You don't know...

325
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:31,902
lsummon,
I summon, I summon...

326
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:33,864
And disarm! Now!

327
00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:36,590
Okay. Okay. Okay.

328
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:38,270
No, Oscar, no!
He's a friend!

329
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:39,745
Okay.
He's a friend.

330
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:43,508
Okay, the client is Heymont Brake and Tire.
They're family owned,

331
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:45,503
but don't let that
take away your edge.

332
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:48,948
Come on, Pam, I know you can fail.
I see failure in you.

333
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:53,141
Remember, you're a scum bag, so you
think scummy thoughts, like this.

334
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:59,470
Hello, this is Pam Halpert. I'm
calling from Dunder Mifflin.

335
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:01,864
Yes, your paper provider.

336
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:05,581
And I just called to say

337
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:07,862
your mama is so fat,
when she wears red

338
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:09,430
people yell "Hey, Kool-Aid!"

339
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:12,424
Yeah, your mom is fat!
This is Pam Halpert!

340
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:15,824
- Did they say anything?
- What did they say?

341
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:18,068
I couldn't tell. I don't...
Were they angry?

342
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:19,944
I felt like they
were confused at least.

343
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:21,749
Okay.

344
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:24,906
Oh, my-

345
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:30,224
Dunder Mifflin, this is Erin.
Yes, you can.

346
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:32,341
Okay-

347
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:36,225
I will make sure
that goes on file.

348
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:39,543
Ladies and gentlemen,
we just lost a client!

349
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:41,662
Yes!
All right!

350
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:44,344
Come on! You did good.
You did good.

351
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:46,309
See you later, Heymont!

352
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:52,551
If you chase me,
I will run so fast.

353
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:55,425
If you catch me, I will bite so hard.
Got it?

354
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:57,311
Goodbye, my friend.

355
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:58,547
What the hell, Dwight?

356
00:16:58,660 --> 00:16:59,786
See you later, Trevor!

357
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:01,585
You are incorrigible!

358
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:04,664
I just saved your life!
You're welcome!

359
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:10,145
You hired someone
to hit me with a pipe!

360
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:12,427
You deserve
every bit of it!

361
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:14,343
You made my husband gay!

362
00:17:15,460 --> 00:17:19,351
What I did was wrong, and I have
to live with that every day.

363
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:23,509
But your husband is gay and he
was gay when you married him.

364
00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:24,746
No, no.

365
00:17:24,820 --> 00:17:26,060
Angela,
until you face that,

366
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:28,461
you're going to be confused and
angry for all the wrong reasons.

367
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:30,907
But if you want to blame
me for the whole thing,

368
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:34,068
go ahead.
I won't stop you.

369
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:35,949
Hit me, you have my blessing.
Hit me!

370
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:38,581
Well, are you
going to let go of it?

371
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:40,901
Because part of the blame
is definitely on you.

372
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:42,027
Angela,
it's a lead fricking pipe!

373
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:43,227
God!

374
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:45,911
You were supposed
to be my friend!

375
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:47,505
I'm so sorry! Angela!

376
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:48,741
Oscar.

377
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:57,542
Our crowning complaint card comes
to us thanks to Pamela Halpert.

378
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:03,828
For insulting a client's
recently deceased mother.

379
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:06,146
I did not know that.
No.

380
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:09,781
A woman who struggled
with obesity all her life.

381
00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:11,510
I am so sorry.

382
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:15,380
Yeah, that is terrible.

383
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:17,791
All right!

384
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:19,390
Go, Pam!

385
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:21,429
You did it!

386
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:34,228
I feel so stupid.
I sit next to him every day.

387
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:38,470
You're not stupid.
Jazz is stupid.

388
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:44,861
Jazz is stupid! I mean,
just play the right notes!

389
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:46,943
I know.

390
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:52,944
You're going to
be okay, Monkey.

391
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:02,061
Idon%Hke
your friend Trevor.

392
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:04,428
I don't like him either.

393
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:09,390
And yet,
I really like him.

394
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:18,188
Well, we're here.

395
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:20,630
Perfect.

396
00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:31,667
We're going to cover for you, you know?

397
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:35,143
Phyllis, what was that? Phyllis,
are you dreaming, or...

398
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:38,705
I did enjoy
grinding your beans, son.

399
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:42,545
Yeah, we really
did peel your grapes.

400
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:45,066
This is hilarious. But we're
going to stop with all the...

401
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:46,511
Shucking your peas!

402
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:47,951
Shucking my peas.

403
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:51,069
All right, just go back to the first part.
You are going to cover for me?

404
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:52,546
Yeah.

405
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:55,191
Of course we are, Jimmy.
We love you guys.

406
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:58,629
Oh, my God!
Thank you. Thank you.

407
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:02,101
If you're an artist, you have
to be okay with the idea

408
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:04,069
that you can't please
everybody all the time.

409
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:05,426
You paint very bad, bad!

410
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:06,905
Shut up, Hide!

411
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:09,782
I mean, do you think Kevin cares
what people think about him?

412
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:11,988
Or Creed? Or Meredith?

413
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:15,990
Oh, my gosh,
these are my role models now.

414
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:19,466
You know what?
I'm okay with that.

415
00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:27,023
Where does gayness come from
and how is it transmitted?

416
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:30,550
Now that is
a loaded question.

417
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:33,100
My pastor said it can
come from breast feeding.

418
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:35,506
He said that?

419
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:37,150
Well, he didn't
fight me hard on it.

420
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:41,947
I don't know if
there's truth to that.

421
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:45,867
What is it called when two
men intertwine their penises

422
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:48,910
like the snakes on
the medic-alert bracelet?

423
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:50,541
Uh...

424
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:53,590
Is it called Red Vine-ing?

425
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:57,622
We heard it was called Red Vine-ing.
People Red-Vine?

426
00:20:58,780 --> 00:21:01,909
Where are
gay men's vaginae?

427
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:05,150
They don't have vaginae.

428
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:06,500
What?

429
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:10,070
No. They're just
regular men.

430
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:13,541
When two gay men have sex,

431
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:16,385
how do they know
whose penis will open up

432
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:18,747
to accept
the other person's penis?

433
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:23,581
Wow.
