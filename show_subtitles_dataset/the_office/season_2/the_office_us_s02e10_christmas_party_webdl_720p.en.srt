1
00:00:02,368 --> 00:00:04,002
Go.
In the door.

2
00:00:04,004 --> 00:00:05,037
Push!

3
00:00:05,039 --> 00:00:06,772
Oh, God.
Push.

4
00:00:06,774 --> 00:00:07,806
No no no!
Turn it around.

5
00:00:07,808 --> 00:00:08,807
Turn it around.
You're breaking...

6
00:00:08,809 --> 00:00:09,808
Shove it through!

7
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:11,210
You shove it.

8
00:00:11,212 --> 00:00:12,411
Shove it back!

9
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:16,448
Here we go.

10
00:00:16,450 --> 00:00:19,351
Don't break
the branches, Dwight.

11
00:00:21,254 --> 00:00:22,955
Ah, I got a splinter.

12
00:00:22,957 --> 00:00:25,023
Well, suck it up.
We all have problems.

13
00:00:25,025 --> 00:00:26,325
Hey, everybody!

14
00:00:26,327 --> 00:00:27,860
Look what we have!

15
00:00:30,431 --> 00:00:32,164
Nice, huh?

16
00:00:32,166 --> 00:00:33,866
I've got it leveraged.
Push!

17
00:00:33,868 --> 00:00:37,336
One, two, three!

18
00:00:37,338 --> 00:00:38,537
Ah!

19
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:41,540
Merry Christmas!

20
00:01:18,578 --> 00:01:20,546
Did it work?

21
00:01:20,548 --> 00:01:22,848
Well, sort of.

22
00:01:22,850 --> 00:01:25,717
Why did you get it so big?

23
00:01:25,719 --> 00:01:28,086
That's what she said.

24
00:01:28,088 --> 00:01:30,289
And B: I wanted it
to be impressive.

25
00:01:30,291 --> 00:01:31,557
The biggest day of the year

26
00:01:31,559 --> 00:01:33,125
deserves the
biggest tree of the year.

27
00:01:33,127 --> 00:01:35,527
But what are we gonna do
with this hacked off part?

28
00:01:35,529 --> 00:01:38,597
Well, that is perfectly good
mini tree, Kevin.

29
00:01:38,599 --> 00:01:41,600
And we are going
to sell that to charity.

30
00:01:41,602 --> 00:01:43,602
That's what Christmas
is all about.

31
00:01:51,978 --> 00:01:53,245
So this year,
for the first time ever,

32
00:01:53,247 --> 00:01:55,814
I got Pam in Secret Santa.

33
00:01:55,816 --> 00:01:57,416
And I got her this teapot

34
00:01:57,418 --> 00:01:59,585
which I know she really wants.

35
00:01:59,587 --> 00:02:00,953
So she can make tea at her desk,

36
00:02:00,955 --> 00:02:03,655
but I'm also gonna stuff it
with some inside jokes.

37
00:02:03,657 --> 00:02:07,426
Like, this is my
high school yearbook photo.

38
00:02:07,428 --> 00:02:08,827
She saw it at the party.

39
00:02:08,829 --> 00:02:11,063
And it really makes her laugh.

40
00:02:11,065 --> 00:02:12,464
I'm not sure why.

41
00:02:12,466 --> 00:02:14,399
Um, what else?

42
00:02:14,401 --> 00:02:17,269
Ooh, this is a hot sauce packet.

43
00:02:17,271 --> 00:02:20,239
She put this on a hot dog
a couple years ago

44
00:02:20,241 --> 00:02:23,208
because she thought
it was catsup.

45
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:27,212
And it was really funny,
so I kept the other two.

46
00:02:27,214 --> 00:02:29,581
This would take a little
too long to explain.

47
00:02:29,583 --> 00:02:31,350
So I won't.

48
00:02:31,352 --> 00:02:33,252
And this is a card.

49
00:02:33,254 --> 00:02:37,789
Because Christmas is the time
to tell people how you feel.

50
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:42,127
Is there anything we're missing?

51
00:02:42,129 --> 00:02:43,996
Phyllis, you got the lights?

52
00:02:43,998 --> 00:02:45,597
Yes, I got
those cute little ones.

53
00:02:47,133 --> 00:02:48,900
Do you think I should have
gotten the big ones?

54
00:02:48,902 --> 00:02:50,802
We'll see.

55
00:02:50,804 --> 00:02:54,006
Angela drafted me into
the party planning committee.

56
00:02:54,008 --> 00:02:55,173
Her memo said that we need to

57
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:58,510
prepare for every
possible disaster.

58
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:03,615
Which, to me,
seems... excessive.

59
00:03:03,617 --> 00:03:06,084
Merry Christmas!

60
00:03:06,086 --> 00:03:08,553
Ho ho ho!
Pimp!

61
00:03:08,555 --> 00:03:10,255
I'm kidding!

62
00:03:10,257 --> 00:03:11,256
What do we got?
What do we got?

63
00:03:11,258 --> 00:03:12,624
How many plates are we getting?

64
00:03:12,626 --> 00:03:13,792
50.
Ooh, double it.

65
00:03:13,794 --> 00:03:15,093
Double everything.
Double ice cream.

66
00:03:15,095 --> 00:03:16,828
Double napkins.
Double it.

67
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:18,563
On me.

68
00:03:18,565 --> 00:03:19,765
It was a tough year.

69
00:03:19,767 --> 00:03:21,466
I had to fire somebody
this year.

70
00:03:21,468 --> 00:03:24,002
This party has to really rock.

71
00:03:24,004 --> 00:03:26,038
Check it out.

72
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,673
Christmas bonus, 3,000 Gs.

73
00:03:27,675 --> 00:03:31,343
I got this for helping
save the company money.

74
00:03:31,345 --> 00:03:32,344
So I guess some good came out of

75
00:03:32,346 --> 00:03:33,912
firing Devin after all.

76
00:03:34,747 --> 00:03:36,915
Maybe I should call him,
tell him that.

77
00:03:36,917 --> 00:03:38,817
I want people to cut loose.

78
00:03:38,819 --> 00:03:39,951
I want people...

79
00:03:39,953 --> 00:03:41,520
making out in closets.

80
00:03:43,057 --> 00:03:45,791
I want people
hanging from the ceilings,

81
00:03:45,793 --> 00:03:47,059
lampshades on the heads.

82
00:03:47,061 --> 00:03:50,128
I want it to be
a Playboy Mansion party.

83
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:52,064
And also, I want you to know,

84
00:03:52,066 --> 00:03:53,065
and spread the word,

85
00:03:53,067 --> 00:03:54,333
that I will have
my digital camera.

86
00:03:54,335 --> 00:03:57,469
And I will be taking pictures
all the way.

87
00:03:57,471 --> 00:03:59,204
And the best and craziest
thing that happens

88
00:03:59,206 --> 00:04:00,939
will be on the cover
of the newsletter.

89
00:04:00,941 --> 00:04:02,007
Incentive.

90
00:04:02,009 --> 00:04:03,208
You do realize

91
00:04:03,210 --> 00:04:04,343
that we can't serve liquor
at the party.

92
00:04:04,345 --> 00:04:06,778
Yeah, I know.
Dammit.

93
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:08,714
Stupid corporate wet blankets.

94
00:04:08,716 --> 00:04:10,082
Like booze ever killed anybody.

95
00:04:11,451 --> 00:04:13,418
One, two, three.

96
00:04:15,288 --> 00:04:17,622
You guys should use
a hand truck.

97
00:04:17,624 --> 00:04:18,924
Do we have one?

98
00:04:19,826 --> 00:04:20,892
No.

99
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:25,597
Will you help me?

100
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:27,332
No!

101
00:04:27,334 --> 00:04:29,334
No way.
It... no.

102
00:04:29,336 --> 00:04:30,502
Come on, Mike,
let me borrow the hat.

103
00:04:30,504 --> 00:04:31,503
For just a couple of hours.

104
00:04:31,505 --> 00:04:32,504
You wanna be Santa?
Yeah.

105
00:04:32,506 --> 00:04:34,039
Have you ever seen Santa?

106
00:04:34,041 --> 00:04:36,675
Yeah, I've seen Santa.
Who cares?

107
00:04:36,677 --> 00:04:37,809
Well, I'm sorry.

108
00:04:37,811 --> 00:04:39,277
It just doesn't work.

109
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:41,747
Michael, I would like
to be the elf.

110
00:04:41,749 --> 00:04:44,883
That makes sense,
because he has elfish features.

111
00:04:47,186 --> 00:04:48,186
Okay, everyone, listen up!

112
00:04:48,188 --> 00:04:50,856
It is time to get your presents,

113
00:04:50,858 --> 00:04:57,529
wrap them, and place them
under the tree like so.

114
00:04:57,531 --> 00:04:59,231
If you do not get your present

115
00:04:59,233 --> 00:05:00,732
wrapped and under the tree

116
00:05:00,734 --> 00:05:03,268
within the next five minutes...

117
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:06,004
you will be disqualified
from Secret Santa.

118
00:05:06,006 --> 00:05:07,839
All right?
No exceptions.

119
00:05:07,841 --> 00:05:09,074
Except Michael.

120
00:05:09,076 --> 00:05:10,475
I got Angela.

121
00:05:11,244 --> 00:05:14,913
She's into
these posters of babies

122
00:05:14,915 --> 00:05:16,214
dressed as adults.

123
00:05:16,216 --> 00:05:17,883
I got her one of those.

124
00:05:17,885 --> 00:05:21,119
I felt kind of weird
buying that.

125
00:05:21,121 --> 00:05:22,254
I got Creed.

126
00:05:22,256 --> 00:05:23,355
And to tell you the truth,

127
00:05:23,357 --> 00:05:25,023
I don't know
anything about Creed.

128
00:05:25,025 --> 00:05:26,158
I know his name's Creed.

129
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,793
I know he works
right over there.

130
00:05:27,795 --> 00:05:29,694
I think he's Irish and I...

131
00:05:30,496 --> 00:05:32,531
I got him this
shamrock keychain.

132
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:37,736
I got myself for Secret Santa.

133
00:05:37,738 --> 00:05:39,471
I was supposed to tell somebody,

134
00:05:39,473 --> 00:05:40,972
but I didn't.

135
00:05:42,442 --> 00:05:43,775
You get something
good this year?

136
00:05:43,777 --> 00:05:46,711
Uh, I think I did
a pretty good job.

137
00:05:46,713 --> 00:05:49,080
Yeah?
Who'd you have?

138
00:05:49,082 --> 00:05:50,782
I can't tell you,
'cause it's a secret.

139
00:05:50,784 --> 00:05:52,617
I think I got something
pretty nice for my guy.

140
00:05:52,619 --> 00:05:53,919
Yeah?
Spent a lot of dough.

141
00:05:53,921 --> 00:05:55,420
A lot of dough.
Wow.

142
00:05:55,422 --> 00:05:57,823
Well, there's a $20 limit,
right?

143
00:05:57,825 --> 00:05:59,658
Yeah, I wanted this party
to be really special

144
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:01,460
so I sorta went
above and beyond.

145
00:06:01,462 --> 00:06:03,161
That's great... well,
don't tell me who it is...

146
00:06:03,163 --> 00:06:04,696
It was Ryan!

147
00:06:04,698 --> 00:06:07,599
Yep, I have Ryan.

148
00:06:07,601 --> 00:06:09,167
Gather 'round.

149
00:06:09,169 --> 00:06:10,635
Secret Santa.
Let's go.

150
00:06:10,637 --> 00:06:12,337
Let's go.
Come on.

151
00:06:12,339 --> 00:06:14,272
Stanley... no, I'm gonna
handle the cord, okay?

152
00:06:14,274 --> 00:06:15,474
Safety reasons.

153
00:06:15,476 --> 00:06:16,875
I know how to plug something in.

154
00:06:16,877 --> 00:06:18,310
I wanna do it.

155
00:06:18,312 --> 00:06:21,746
All right, let's count it down

156
00:06:21,748 --> 00:06:22,814
like Rockefeller Center.

157
00:06:22,816 --> 00:06:24,649
Ready?

158
00:06:24,651 --> 00:06:27,853
Three, two, one.

159
00:06:27,855 --> 00:06:30,655
Yeah!

160
00:06:30,657 --> 00:06:32,057
Not great.

161
00:06:32,059 --> 00:06:35,060
Sorry, everybody.

162
00:06:35,062 --> 00:06:37,062
I think the tree looks nice.

163
00:06:37,064 --> 00:06:38,964
Hey, I could get some
flares from my car.

164
00:06:38,966 --> 00:06:40,098
No, no.

165
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:41,132
Shake it off, everybody.

166
00:06:41,134 --> 00:06:42,567
Just... let's do
Secret Santa.

167
00:06:42,569 --> 00:06:45,437
Presents are the best way
to show someone

168
00:06:45,439 --> 00:06:46,771
how much you care.

169
00:06:46,773 --> 00:06:48,740
It is like this tangible thing

170
00:06:48,742 --> 00:06:50,509
that you can point to and say,

171
00:06:50,511 --> 00:06:52,244
"Hey, man, I love you...

172
00:06:52,246 --> 00:06:53,912
this many dollars worth."

173
00:06:53,914 --> 00:06:56,281
First present, Oscar.

174
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:01,820
A shower radio, neat.

175
00:07:01,822 --> 00:07:02,821
Oh, great, that was from me.

176
00:07:02,823 --> 00:07:03,889
Thanks, Kelly.

177
00:07:03,891 --> 00:07:05,223
You know, I was
gonna get one of these...

178
00:07:05,225 --> 00:07:06,258
Okay, okay, that's enough.

179
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:07,759
Let's keep it moving on.

180
00:07:07,761 --> 00:07:08,894
Jim.

181
00:07:08,896 --> 00:07:09,995
Oh, cool.

182
00:07:13,633 --> 00:07:15,267
That's from me.

183
00:07:15,269 --> 00:07:18,270
Great.
Where'd you get it?

184
00:07:18,272 --> 00:07:20,872
I don't know,
it was so long ago.

185
00:07:20,874 --> 00:07:23,041
He obviously forgot
to get me something.

186
00:07:23,043 --> 00:07:24,175
And then he went into his closet

187
00:07:24,177 --> 00:07:26,545
and dug out this little number.

188
00:07:26,547 --> 00:07:28,113
And then threw it in a bag.

189
00:07:28,115 --> 00:07:30,248
Yep, that's exactly
what happened.

190
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:32,417
Pam.

191
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:40,592
Oh, my God!

192
00:07:42,428 --> 00:07:44,129
Thank you very much, Santa.

193
00:07:44,131 --> 00:07:46,531
Whoever you are.
It's awesome.

194
00:07:46,533 --> 00:07:48,099
There's a little more to it.

195
00:07:48,101 --> 00:07:49,200
All right, next.

196
00:07:49,202 --> 00:07:50,335
Ryan.

197
00:07:50,337 --> 00:07:51,436
No!

198
00:07:56,442 --> 00:07:58,577
Whoa.
Video iPod.

199
00:07:58,579 --> 00:08:01,413
Ho ho, wow, geez.

200
00:08:01,415 --> 00:08:02,581
Somebody really got carried away

201
00:08:02,583 --> 00:08:04,049
with the spirit of Christmas.

202
00:08:04,051 --> 00:08:05,350
It was me.

203
00:08:05,352 --> 00:08:07,085
I got carried away
with the spirit.

204
00:08:07,087 --> 00:08:10,455
Wasn't there a $20 limit
on the gifts?

205
00:08:10,457 --> 00:08:12,190
This is 400 bucks.

206
00:08:12,192 --> 00:08:13,892
You don't know that.

207
00:08:13,894 --> 00:08:15,293
Yeah, you left the price on.

208
00:08:15,295 --> 00:08:17,162
I did... what?
Oh, shoot.

209
00:08:17,164 --> 00:08:18,196
Wow, okay.

210
00:08:18,198 --> 00:08:19,731
Well, who cares?

211
00:08:19,733 --> 00:08:20,999
It doesn't matter what I spent.

212
00:08:21,001 --> 00:08:23,468
What matters is that
Christmas is fun, right?

213
00:08:24,937 --> 00:08:26,471
Michael.

214
00:08:26,473 --> 00:08:29,074
Oh, hey.
For me?

215
00:08:29,076 --> 00:08:31,710
What is in here?

216
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:35,547
Oh, come on.

217
00:08:35,549 --> 00:08:36,982
I knitted it for you.

218
00:08:36,984 --> 00:08:38,817
An oven mitt?

219
00:08:43,122 --> 00:08:44,489
So Phyllis is basically saying,

220
00:08:44,491 --> 00:08:45,657
"Hey, Michael, I know
you did a lot

221
00:08:45,659 --> 00:08:47,025
"to help the office this year.

222
00:08:47,027 --> 00:08:48,326
"But I only care about you

223
00:08:48,328 --> 00:08:50,996
a homemade oven mitt's
worth."

224
00:08:50,998 --> 00:08:53,431
I gave Ryan an iPod.

225
00:08:55,768 --> 00:08:59,237
Uh, should we just keep
opening up the presents?

226
00:08:59,239 --> 00:09:00,572
We don't do anything

227
00:09:00,574 --> 00:09:02,374
until Michael gives us
further instructions.

228
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:08,680
I got it!

229
00:09:08,682 --> 00:09:12,117
We are going to turn
Secret Santa

230
00:09:12,119 --> 00:09:13,985
into Yankee Swap!

231
00:09:13,987 --> 00:09:15,553
What is Yankee Swap?

232
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:18,189
One person chooses a gift.

233
00:09:18,191 --> 00:09:20,759
The next person can either
choose a gift

234
00:09:20,761 --> 00:09:23,628
or steal that person's gift.

235
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:25,463
If your gift gets stolen,
then you can

236
00:09:25,465 --> 00:09:28,199
steal someone else's gift
or choose a new gift.

237
00:09:28,201 --> 00:09:30,368
I thought that was called
Nasty Christmas.

238
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:32,237
Yeah, we call it White Elephant.

239
00:09:32,239 --> 00:09:33,838
Well, I call it fun!

240
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,140
Why are we doing this?

241
00:09:35,142 --> 00:09:37,242
Because it's better.
Because it's more special.

242
00:09:37,244 --> 00:09:38,343
It sounds mean.

243
00:09:38,345 --> 00:09:39,477
Shut...

244
00:09:39,479 --> 00:09:40,745
No... it's not.

245
00:09:40,747 --> 00:09:41,813
Okay, just give it a shot.

246
00:09:41,815 --> 00:09:42,881
Michael should have asked

247
00:09:42,883 --> 00:09:44,816
the party planning
committee first.

248
00:09:44,818 --> 00:09:45,950
He's not just supposed to just

249
00:09:45,952 --> 00:09:48,253
spring things on us
out of nowhere.

250
00:09:53,459 --> 00:09:55,660
Okay, Meredith is up first.

251
00:09:55,662 --> 00:09:57,328
Here's the deal.

252
00:09:57,330 --> 00:09:59,097
You can either pick a new gift,

253
00:09:59,099 --> 00:10:01,366
or you can steal
somebody else's gift

254
00:10:01,368 --> 00:10:02,500
they've already gotten.

255
00:10:02,502 --> 00:10:03,535
Like the oven mitt.

256
00:10:03,537 --> 00:10:06,471
I'll take the teapot.

257
00:10:06,473 --> 00:10:07,639
Oh, shouldn't we...

258
00:10:07,641 --> 00:10:09,474
I bought that
specifically for Pam.

259
00:10:09,476 --> 00:10:10,642
Yaaankee Swap.

260
00:10:10,644 --> 00:10:12,744
That's what makes it fun.

261
00:10:12,746 --> 00:10:14,312
Pam, you can steal
the oven mitt now.

262
00:10:14,314 --> 00:10:15,613
I'll take the iPod.

263
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:18,717
And I have to give it to her?
I don't have a choice?

264
00:10:18,719 --> 00:10:20,251
Yes, now you can steal
the oven mitt,

265
00:10:20,253 --> 00:10:21,986
the old shirt,
or the shower radio.

266
00:10:21,988 --> 00:10:23,722
Or pick a new gift.

267
00:10:35,401 --> 00:10:36,468
That was meant for Kelly.

268
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:37,635
Yeah, I figured.

269
00:10:42,942 --> 00:10:45,677
I think this is going great.

270
00:10:53,786 --> 00:10:55,019
Yikes.

271
00:10:55,021 --> 00:10:57,822
Well, it's for Angela, so...

272
00:11:00,459 --> 00:11:01,726
That's like the creepiest thing

273
00:11:01,728 --> 00:11:03,294
that I've ever seen.

274
00:11:03,296 --> 00:11:04,395
Angela, you're up.

275
00:11:07,733 --> 00:11:09,400
I'll take the poster.

276
00:11:12,071 --> 00:11:14,072
Some people like these.

277
00:11:14,074 --> 00:11:16,074
I will steal the iPod.

278
00:11:17,476 --> 00:11:18,576
Everyone wants the iPod.

279
00:11:18,578 --> 00:11:20,178
It is a huge hit.

280
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:22,714
It is almost
a Christmas miracle.

281
00:11:22,716 --> 00:11:26,417
Ah, well, Oscar,
you little gourmand,

282
00:11:26,419 --> 00:11:28,186
you have the next turn.

283
00:11:28,188 --> 00:11:31,523
I'll take the teapot.

284
00:11:31,525 --> 00:11:32,557
Dammit.

285
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:34,025
Okay, moving along,

286
00:11:34,027 --> 00:11:35,393
Meredith, let's go.

287
00:11:35,395 --> 00:11:37,529
I really want the iPod.

288
00:11:37,531 --> 00:11:38,863
A-ca-ca-ca.
It's already been stolen

289
00:11:38,865 --> 00:11:40,298
this round, pick something else.

290
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:42,600
I hope nobody takes this baby,

291
00:11:42,602 --> 00:11:43,902
'cause this is great.

292
00:11:43,904 --> 00:11:47,238
Wow, look at
that fine craftsmanship.

293
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:49,641
Somebody really put
a lot of work into that.

294
00:11:49,643 --> 00:11:50,742
It's beautiful.

295
00:11:50,744 --> 00:11:52,477
I'll take the oven mitt.

296
00:11:52,479 --> 00:11:55,914
Ssssssssucka!

297
00:11:57,651 --> 00:11:58,983
See, I wanted somebody
to take it.

298
00:11:58,985 --> 00:12:00,985
Boom.
Reverse psychology.

299
00:12:00,987 --> 00:12:03,988
Reverse psychology
is an awesome tool.

300
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:05,590
I don't know if you guys
know about it.

301
00:12:05,592 --> 00:12:08,493
But, basically,
you make someone think

302
00:12:08,495 --> 00:12:11,196
the opposite
of what you believe.

303
00:12:11,198 --> 00:12:14,833
And that tricks them
into doing something stupid.

304
00:12:14,835 --> 00:12:16,067
Works like a charm.

305
00:12:22,975 --> 00:12:24,542
In addition to these
paint ball pellets,

306
00:12:24,544 --> 00:12:27,278
your gift includes
two paintball lessons

307
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:28,613
with Dwight Shroot.

308
00:12:28,615 --> 00:12:31,549
You and me, Michael.
Yes!

309
00:12:34,386 --> 00:12:36,955
Who wants to take
paintball lessons?

310
00:12:36,957 --> 00:12:38,423
How is that better than an iPod?

311
00:12:38,425 --> 00:12:40,925
I never said it was better
than an iPod.

312
00:12:43,996 --> 00:12:46,030
Michael keeps bragging
about his iPod.

313
00:12:46,032 --> 00:12:47,699
But, you know what?

314
00:12:47,701 --> 00:12:49,100
Two paintball lessons
with someone

315
00:12:49,102 --> 00:12:50,168
as experienced as I am,

316
00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:52,637
is worth, easily,
like, two grand.

317
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:54,672
Take, that, Saddam.

318
00:12:54,674 --> 00:12:56,574
Last gift, Kevin.

319
00:12:56,576 --> 00:12:58,676
I want the footbath.

320
00:13:01,714 --> 00:13:03,214
That's the thing
I bought myself.

321
00:13:03,216 --> 00:13:05,650
I'm really psyched to use it.

322
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:11,489
Maybe I should have
taken the iPod.

323
00:13:12,491 --> 00:13:15,393
Oh, shoot.

324
00:13:15,395 --> 00:13:18,162
Pam, steal something
or pick the final gift.

325
00:13:18,164 --> 00:13:20,265
I want the iPod.
Dammit.

326
00:13:20,267 --> 00:13:21,566
Sure you don't want the teapot?

327
00:13:22,701 --> 00:13:24,869
I mean, it's an iPod.

328
00:13:24,871 --> 00:13:26,004
Right.
Sorry.

329
00:13:26,006 --> 00:13:27,505
No no, definitely.

330
00:13:27,507 --> 00:13:31,476
Okay, well, I guess I will take

331
00:13:31,478 --> 00:13:33,711
that book of short stories.

332
00:13:33,713 --> 00:13:34,879
Yes!
There you go.

333
00:13:34,881 --> 00:13:38,182
I want the teapot.
Gracias.

334
00:13:38,184 --> 00:13:39,517
You gotta be kidding me.

335
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:44,455
Yankee Swap is like
Machiavelli meets...

336
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:47,692
Christmas.

337
00:13:49,595 --> 00:13:50,929
What is she so upset about?

338
00:13:50,931 --> 00:13:52,897
Maybe because you hated
her present so much.

339
00:13:52,899 --> 00:13:55,700
Come on... I think Yankee Swap
was a big hit.

340
00:13:55,702 --> 00:13:56,968
I think it was a success.

341
00:13:56,970 --> 00:13:58,069
And I'm the one who ended up

342
00:13:58,071 --> 00:13:59,537
with Dwight's stupid
paint ball pellets.

343
00:13:59,539 --> 00:14:00,838
Yeah, but Michael, the point is

344
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,774
is that we all bought gifts
for specific people.

345
00:14:02,776 --> 00:14:04,542
And you should have just
bought a $20 gift

346
00:14:04,544 --> 00:14:05,643
like everyone else.

347
00:14:05,645 --> 00:14:07,512
Well, I didn't!

348
00:14:07,514 --> 00:14:09,681
I got a big bonus
because I fired Devin,

349
00:14:09,683 --> 00:14:11,215
and I used the money
to buy something awesome.

350
00:14:11,217 --> 00:14:12,283
Sue me!

351
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,887
You got a bonus check?

352
00:14:15,889 --> 00:14:16,988
How much?

353
00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:19,190
Uh, it wasn't...

354
00:14:19,192 --> 00:14:20,725
It wasn't that much.

355
00:14:20,727 --> 00:14:22,393
It was 3,000.

356
00:14:22,395 --> 00:14:24,162
All right, I'm done now.

357
00:14:27,766 --> 00:14:29,067
Unbelievable.

358
00:14:29,069 --> 00:14:31,169
I do the nicest thing
that anyone's ever done

359
00:14:31,171 --> 00:14:32,870
for these people
and they freak out.

360
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:35,039
Well, happy birthday, Jesus.

361
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:36,474
Sorry your party's so lame.

362
00:14:39,912 --> 00:14:41,980
That comes to
166.41.

363
00:14:41,982 --> 00:14:43,414
All right, now,
you're the expert.

364
00:14:43,416 --> 00:14:45,883
Is this enough to get
20 people plastered?

365
00:14:47,219 --> 00:14:49,454
15 bottles of vodka?

366
00:14:49,456 --> 00:14:50,788
Yeah, that should do it.

367
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:52,557
Cool cool, box it up.

368
00:15:02,602 --> 00:15:04,168
I bought this teapot for Pam,

369
00:15:04,170 --> 00:15:05,536
and I know she really wants it.

370
00:15:05,538 --> 00:15:06,637
So can I trade you for it?

371
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:07,805
No trades.
Come on.

372
00:15:07,807 --> 00:15:10,475
It's a shamrock keychain.
Good luck.

373
00:15:10,477 --> 00:15:12,744
A real man makes his own luck.

374
00:15:12,746 --> 00:15:14,545
Billy Zane, Titanic.

375
00:15:14,547 --> 00:15:16,080
Look, it has
sentimental value, Dwight.

376
00:15:16,082 --> 00:15:17,915
Can I buy it from you?

377
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:20,084
No, I want it.
I'm going to use it.

378
00:15:20,086 --> 00:15:21,119
You don't even drink tea.

379
00:15:21,121 --> 00:15:23,588
True, but I get
sinus infections.

380
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:25,056
And sinus infections
can be cured

381
00:15:25,058 --> 00:15:27,225
by making a tea from
green tea leaf stems

382
00:15:27,227 --> 00:15:29,794
and pouring it directly
into your nose like so.

383
00:15:32,698 --> 00:15:34,399
To think that my gift to Pam

384
00:15:34,401 --> 00:15:36,834
will be used for that...

385
00:15:36,836 --> 00:15:37,969
it's a little too much
to handle.

386
00:15:37,971 --> 00:15:39,871
It's a little too much
to handle.

387
00:15:39,873 --> 00:15:41,205
This is awesome.

388
00:15:41,207 --> 00:15:42,907
I know, it's totally
gonna change the way

389
00:15:42,909 --> 00:15:44,042
I work out.

390
00:15:44,044 --> 00:15:45,543
Yeah, and I was gonna get you
one of these

391
00:15:45,545 --> 00:15:47,545
for Christmas.
Now I don't have to.

392
00:15:47,547 --> 00:15:48,646
I'm gonna save a ton of money.

393
00:15:48,648 --> 00:15:49,781
So what are you gonna
get me instead?

394
00:15:49,783 --> 00:15:50,915
I don't know.

395
00:15:50,917 --> 00:15:53,117
Probably like
a sweater or something.

396
00:15:55,888 --> 00:16:00,391
Uh oh, looks like
Santa was a little naughty.

397
00:16:01,694 --> 00:16:02,727
What is that?

398
00:16:02,729 --> 00:16:05,096
This is Christmas spirit.

399
00:16:05,098 --> 00:16:07,098
As in spirits.
Booze.

400
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:08,699
We can drink?

401
00:16:08,701 --> 00:16:11,035
We're really not supposed
to serve alcohol.

402
00:16:11,037 --> 00:16:12,236
Zip it, Toby.

403
00:16:12,238 --> 00:16:14,639
Just... I mean,
it's a party, come on.

404
00:16:14,641 --> 00:16:16,274
If I can't throw
a good party for my employees,

405
00:16:16,276 --> 00:16:17,442
then I am a terrible boss.

406
00:16:19,578 --> 00:16:21,279
Who wants a drink?
Me, please.

407
00:16:21,281 --> 00:16:22,480
Go!
Here we go!

408
00:16:24,116 --> 00:16:26,217
The deal is that
this is my last hurrah.

409
00:16:26,219 --> 00:16:28,219
'Cause I made a New Year's
resolution

410
00:16:28,221 --> 00:16:31,022
that I'm not gonna drink anymore

411
00:16:31,024 --> 00:16:32,356
during the week.

412
00:16:32,358 --> 00:16:34,058
Hi, guys.

413
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:35,560
Uh, does everyone
know my boyfriend

414
00:16:35,562 --> 00:16:36,661
Bob Vance?

415
00:16:36,663 --> 00:16:38,129
Kevin Malone.

416
00:16:38,131 --> 00:16:40,198
Bob Vance.
Vance refrigeration.

417
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,332
Stanley Hudson.

418
00:16:41,334 --> 00:16:43,134
Bob Vance.
Vance refrigeration.

419
00:16:43,136 --> 00:16:44,535
Ryan Howard.
Bob Vance.

420
00:16:44,537 --> 00:16:45,703
Vance refrigeration.

421
00:16:46,872 --> 00:16:48,005
What line of work
are you in, Bob?

422
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:49,240
What line of work
are you in, Bob?

423
00:16:50,142 --> 00:16:54,112
I got... I lost Culpepper at TO,
it was over, man.

424
00:16:54,114 --> 00:16:56,180
Oh yeah, I need McNabb
and Deon Branch

425
00:16:56,182 --> 00:16:57,949
to have big games
or else I'm done.

426
00:16:57,951 --> 00:16:59,450
It's possible.

427
00:16:59,452 --> 00:17:01,452
I can't believe you traded
Sean Alexander, man.

428
00:17:01,454 --> 00:17:02,653
I had to, I needed defense.

429
00:17:02,655 --> 00:17:04,188
Come on!
Sean Alexander?

430
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:05,556
He's the best back
in the league!

431
00:17:05,558 --> 00:17:07,992
Defense.
Oh, no, that's not worth it.

432
00:17:07,994 --> 00:17:09,026
It is worth it.

433
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:10,995
Are you kidding?
You wait.

434
00:17:10,997 --> 00:17:13,931
Anybody making out in here?

435
00:17:13,933 --> 00:17:16,000
No yet, give it time.

436
00:17:16,002 --> 00:17:17,101
Oh, hey, Ebenezer.

437
00:17:17,103 --> 00:17:18,102
Boink.

438
00:17:18,104 --> 00:17:19,837
Okay, how's it going in here?

439
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:21,005
We're running low on cups.

440
00:17:21,007 --> 00:17:22,306
Do you want me to just
run out and...

441
00:17:22,308 --> 00:17:23,407
No no no no no.

442
00:17:23,409 --> 00:17:24,876
We'll find some.
Don't leave the party.

443
00:17:24,878 --> 00:17:27,678
One, two, three!

444
00:17:29,515 --> 00:17:32,183
Gaah!
Ho ho ho!

445
00:17:32,185 --> 00:17:34,852
Kudos to Ryan,
king of the party committee!

446
00:17:34,854 --> 00:17:37,955
Oh, no, I really
did not do anything.

447
00:17:37,957 --> 00:17:39,357
No false modesty, my friend.

448
00:17:43,530 --> 00:17:45,296
You know, you don't have to
answer calls

449
00:17:45,298 --> 00:17:46,697
during a party.

450
00:17:46,699 --> 00:17:48,766
Just thought you should know.

451
00:17:48,768 --> 00:17:51,936
No, I was just, um,
checking out my present.

452
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,841
I traded with Dwight.

453
00:17:56,843 --> 00:17:59,710
Um, just... I figured,
you know,

454
00:17:59,712 --> 00:18:01,979
you went to a lot of trouble
and that means a lot.

455
00:18:03,148 --> 00:18:06,450
And also Roy got me an iPod

456
00:18:06,452 --> 00:18:09,720
or was going
to get me an iPod, so...

457
00:18:09,722 --> 00:18:11,722
Well, either way.

458
00:18:12,691 --> 00:18:15,126
This is an amazing gift
because it comes with

459
00:18:15,128 --> 00:18:16,594
bonus gifts.

460
00:18:16,596 --> 00:18:18,462
Look inside.

461
00:18:23,502 --> 00:18:24,936
Oh, my God!

462
00:18:24,938 --> 00:18:27,438
The yearbook picture!

463
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:30,875
Yeah, I think I made
the right choice.

464
00:18:30,877 --> 00:18:34,612
Oh, my God.
This is incredible.

465
00:18:34,614 --> 00:18:36,314
Is this the bottle timer?

466
00:18:36,316 --> 00:18:37,615
I didn't think you
were gonna get that one.

467
00:18:37,617 --> 00:18:39,217
I really didn't know.

468
00:18:40,452 --> 00:18:42,520
This is so awesome.

469
00:18:42,522 --> 00:18:43,721
Not bad... and if it couldn't
go to Ryan,

470
00:18:43,723 --> 00:18:46,090
you are the guy
I'd want it to go to.

471
00:18:46,092 --> 00:18:47,391
Thank you.
You're welcome.

472
00:18:47,393 --> 00:18:49,460
Merry Christmas, Asswipe.
No way!

473
00:18:49,462 --> 00:18:52,897
Oh, you're kidding me.
Packer!

474
00:18:52,899 --> 00:18:54,599
Yes!

475
00:18:54,601 --> 00:18:57,001
Todd Packer,
ladies and gentlemen.

476
00:18:57,003 --> 00:18:58,436
What's up, my nerds?

477
00:18:58,438 --> 00:19:00,671
Check it out!
Oh, no.

478
00:19:00,673 --> 00:19:02,073
Oh, look at that!

479
00:19:02,075 --> 00:19:03,841
Icing on the cake!

480
00:19:03,843 --> 00:19:06,344
Pacman need a drinky.

481
00:19:06,346 --> 00:19:07,345
Oh, let's fix you up.

482
00:19:07,347 --> 00:19:08,746
Who wants to fix up... Toby?

483
00:19:08,748 --> 00:19:10,081
Toby's gonna fix you up.

484
00:19:10,083 --> 00:19:11,749
Whoo!
Yeah.

485
00:19:16,956 --> 00:19:19,423
Daryl, here you go.

486
00:19:19,425 --> 00:19:20,491
You earned it.

487
00:19:20,493 --> 00:19:23,261
No no no no no,
I really want you to have it.

488
00:19:23,263 --> 00:19:25,663
All right.
Thanks, man.

489
00:19:25,665 --> 00:19:27,632
Hey, Merry Christmas.

490
00:19:30,168 --> 00:19:31,502
Whose butt is that?

491
00:19:31,504 --> 00:19:33,304
Mine.

492
00:19:33,306 --> 00:19:35,339
Oh, how did I not guess that?

493
00:19:35,341 --> 00:19:38,342
Lampshade on the head!

494
00:19:38,344 --> 00:19:39,844
It's happening!

495
00:19:50,255 --> 00:19:53,357
Hey.
Oh, hello there.

496
00:19:54,693 --> 00:19:56,127
What are you doing?

497
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:58,329
I don't know.

498
00:19:58,331 --> 00:20:00,298
You shouldn't do
things like that.

499
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:01,932
The man is supposed to do that.

500
00:20:14,614 --> 00:20:16,180
Thanks for the party, Michael.

501
00:20:16,182 --> 00:20:18,616
Listen up, we're going to
Poor Richards.

502
00:20:18,618 --> 00:20:20,084
Who's in?
I'm in.

503
00:20:20,086 --> 00:20:23,187
Yes.
Michael?

504
00:20:23,189 --> 00:20:24,922
Poor Richards?

505
00:20:24,924 --> 00:20:26,390
Yeah, that sounds good.

506
00:20:26,392 --> 00:20:28,859
Christmas is awesome.

507
00:20:28,861 --> 00:20:30,061
First of all,

508
00:20:30,063 --> 00:20:32,763
you get to spend time
with people you love.

509
00:20:32,765 --> 00:20:34,598
Secondly, you can get drunk

510
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:36,334
and no one can say anything.

511
00:20:36,336 --> 00:20:38,836
Third, you give presents.

512
00:20:38,838 --> 00:20:39,837
What's better
than giving presents?

513
00:20:39,839 --> 00:20:42,373
And fourth, getting presents.

514
00:20:42,375 --> 00:20:43,407
So four things.

515
00:20:43,409 --> 00:20:44,709
Not bad for one day.

516
00:20:44,711 --> 00:20:48,045
It's really
the greatest day of all time.

517
00:20:50,248 --> 00:20:52,983
Hey, Meredith, heading over
to Poor Richard's?

518
00:20:52,985 --> 00:20:55,653
Yep.
Cool cool cool.

519
00:20:55,655 --> 00:20:58,122
You need a ride?

520
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:10,067
All right, let's head out.

521
00:21:10,069 --> 00:21:11,869
Sounds good.
Do you have a coat?

522
00:21:11,871 --> 00:21:13,204
Yeah.

523
00:21:13,206 --> 00:21:14,772
Ohhhhhhkay.
