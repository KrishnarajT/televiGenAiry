1
00:00:01,838 --> 00:00:03,605
I really like Valentine's Day

2
00:00:03,607 --> 00:00:04,740
in this office.

3
00:00:04,742 --> 00:00:06,342
It's kind of like grade school.

4
00:00:06,344 --> 00:00:09,078
Everybody gives out
little presents and stuff.

5
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:10,546
Like last year,

6
00:00:10,548 --> 00:00:12,948
Jim gave me this card
with Dwight's head on it.

7
00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:16,151
It was horrifying and funny.

8
00:00:23,827 --> 00:00:24,893
Phyllis.

9
00:00:24,895 --> 00:00:27,329
You could just sign here.

10
00:00:27,331 --> 00:00:29,198
Roy and I are saving
for the wedding,

11
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:32,601
so I made him promise not
to get me anything too big.

12
00:00:32,603 --> 00:00:34,103
Happy Valentine's Day, Darling,

13
00:00:34,105 --> 00:00:37,339
love Bob Vance,
Vance Refrigeration.

14
00:00:37,341 --> 00:00:40,275
Isn't he sweet?
Yeah. Wow.

15
00:00:40,277 --> 00:00:41,443
All right, Dwight.

16
00:00:41,445 --> 00:00:43,445
As you know, I'm heading
to New York today

17
00:00:43,447 --> 00:00:45,047
doing a presentation
on the branch

18
00:00:45,049 --> 00:00:46,382
to the new CFO.

19
00:00:46,384 --> 00:00:48,884
And you want me to come with you.
No.

20
00:00:48,886 --> 00:00:50,085
Opposite of that.

21
00:00:50,087 --> 00:00:52,254
I will stay here
and run things on this end.

22
00:00:52,256 --> 00:00:53,489
Very good.

23
00:00:53,791 --> 00:00:56,759
Will you be seeing Jan
when you're in New York?

24
00:00:56,761 --> 00:00:58,694
I probably will.
Why do you ask?

25
00:00:58,696 --> 00:01:01,030
Well, it's Valentine's Day.

26
00:01:01,032 --> 00:01:03,132
And you guys, you know...

27
00:01:03,134 --> 00:01:04,333
Yeah.

28
00:01:04,335 --> 00:01:05,834
Screwed.

29
00:01:05,836 --> 00:01:07,703
What is your problem?

30
00:01:07,705 --> 00:01:09,304
This is a business trip.

31
00:01:09,306 --> 00:01:11,273
I would have to be
a raving lunatic

32
00:01:11,275 --> 00:01:12,875
to try to talk to Jan

33
00:01:12,877 --> 00:01:14,376
about what happened between us.

34
00:01:14,378 --> 00:01:15,978
Her words, not mine.

35
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:17,813
She sent me an e-mail
this morning.

36
00:01:19,215 --> 00:01:23,252
But it is Valentine's Day.

37
00:01:23,254 --> 00:01:26,455
It's New York, city of love.

38
00:01:28,091 --> 00:01:29,758
Hey, Pam, you heart NY, right?

39
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:31,427
You want me
to pick you up anything?

40
00:01:31,429 --> 00:01:32,428
That's okay.

41
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:33,529
All right.

42
00:01:33,531 --> 00:01:34,730
The best present would be

43
00:01:34,732 --> 00:01:36,765
you do a good job
in front of the new CFO.

44
00:01:36,767 --> 00:01:38,901
Dude, I'm going to nail it.

45
00:01:38,903 --> 00:01:41,036
Me in New York?
Oh, I own that city.

46
00:01:41,038 --> 00:01:43,172
Fo'get abou' it!

47
00:01:43,174 --> 00:01:44,807
See ya!

48
00:02:18,041 --> 00:02:20,209
Well, here we go
on our way to New York.

49
00:02:20,211 --> 00:02:21,543
New York, New York.

50
00:02:21,545 --> 00:02:24,046
The city so nice,
they named it twice.

51
00:02:24,048 --> 00:02:26,748
Manhattan is the other name.

52
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:29,418
So I broke up with Katy

53
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:30,752
and haven't been dating
anybody else.

54
00:02:30,754 --> 00:02:32,154
So this year,

55
00:02:32,156 --> 00:02:34,156
I don't have to worry
about Valentine's Day.

56
00:02:34,158 --> 00:02:35,157
It's gonna be good.

57
00:02:35,159 --> 00:02:36,425
I invited a couple friends over.

58
00:02:36,427 --> 00:02:37,659
We're gonna play some cards.

59
00:02:37,661 --> 00:02:39,361
And I'll end up winning
a lot of money

60
00:02:39,363 --> 00:02:41,497
because they're idiots.

61
00:02:41,499 --> 00:02:43,265
It's gonna be great.

62
00:02:45,502 --> 00:02:47,769
What's this?
What is this?

63
00:02:47,771 --> 00:02:50,506
I don't know.
It's on your desk.

64
00:02:50,508 --> 00:02:51,740
Yeah, but who put it here

65
00:02:51,742 --> 00:02:53,075
and for what purpose?

66
00:02:53,077 --> 00:02:54,776
It was there when I sat down.

67
00:03:02,152 --> 00:03:06,321
Happy Valentine's Day.

68
00:03:14,797 --> 00:03:15,931
It's me.

69
00:03:16,766 --> 00:03:18,634
I'm the bobble-head.

70
00:03:22,372 --> 00:03:23,772
Yes!

71
00:03:23,774 --> 00:03:26,708
Ah!

72
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:28,577
Yeah.

73
00:03:28,579 --> 00:03:29,578
The meeting
isn't till 3:00.

74
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:30,879
But I always like to come
to New York

75
00:03:30,881 --> 00:03:32,014
a little bit early

76
00:03:32,016 --> 00:03:33,515
and hit some
of my favorite haunts.

77
00:03:33,517 --> 00:03:35,784
Like right here is my favorite
New York pizza joint.

78
00:03:35,786 --> 00:03:39,788
And I'm gonna go get me
a New York slice.

79
00:03:43,159 --> 00:03:45,327
Hey, Kelly. What's up?

80
00:03:45,329 --> 00:03:48,363
Nothing. Oh.
Except, oh my God, Jim.

81
00:03:48,365 --> 00:03:51,934
Last night, Ryan and I
totally finally hooked up.

82
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:53,335
It was awesome.

83
00:03:53,337 --> 00:03:54,937
Oh, that's great.
I'm really happy for you.

84
00:03:54,939 --> 00:03:56,338
I know.
And it was so funny.

85
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:58,140
'Cause we were at this bar
with his friends.

86
00:03:58,142 --> 00:04:00,209
And I was sitting
next to him the whole night.

87
00:04:00,211 --> 00:04:01,376
And he wasn't making a move.

88
00:04:01,378 --> 00:04:02,978
So in my head, I was like, Ryan,

89
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:04,046
what's taking you so long?

90
00:04:04,048 --> 00:04:05,080
And then he kissed me.

91
00:04:05,082 --> 00:04:06,481
And I didn't know what to say.

92
00:04:06,483 --> 00:04:09,751
So I said, "Ryan,
what took you so long?"

93
00:04:09,753 --> 00:04:11,453
I mean, I just said it to him.
Can you believe that?

94
00:04:11,455 --> 00:04:12,487
Wow.

95
00:04:12,489 --> 00:04:14,323
Oh my God, Jim.
Is that embarrassing?

96
00:04:14,325 --> 00:04:15,457
I'm embarrassed.

97
00:04:15,459 --> 00:04:16,491
No, don't be.

98
00:04:16,493 --> 00:04:17,726
Oh, thank God.

99
00:04:17,728 --> 00:04:19,094
Because I was nervous, Jim.

100
00:04:19,096 --> 00:04:20,229
You will not believe.

101
00:04:20,231 --> 00:04:21,263
I bet.

102
00:04:21,265 --> 00:04:22,397
I was so nervous.

103
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:25,901
But now... now I have
a boyfriend.

104
00:04:25,903 --> 00:04:29,171
I hooked up with her
on February 13th.

105
00:04:31,341 --> 00:04:33,342
Here it is.
Heart of New York City.

106
00:04:33,344 --> 00:04:34,810
Times Square.

107
00:04:34,812 --> 00:04:37,112
Named for the good times
you have

108
00:04:37,114 --> 00:04:39,815
when you're in it.

109
00:04:39,817 --> 00:04:41,550
Most people when they come
to New York,

110
00:04:41,552 --> 00:04:43,385
they go straight
to the Empire State Building.

111
00:04:43,387 --> 00:04:46,221
That's very touristy.
I come here.

112
00:04:46,223 --> 00:04:47,589
Great places to eat.

113
00:04:47,591 --> 00:04:50,259
We have Bubba Gump Shrimp,
Red Lobster down there.

114
00:04:50,261 --> 00:04:52,094
You know.

115
00:04:52,096 --> 00:04:56,164
This is... this is the heart
of civilization right here.

116
00:04:57,433 --> 00:04:59,001
Whoa.

117
00:05:02,405 --> 00:05:04,239
Oh.

118
00:05:04,241 --> 00:05:05,374
Guess what?

119
00:05:05,376 --> 00:05:07,209
Really?
Mm-hmm.

120
00:05:08,645 --> 00:05:11,179
They're from Bob again.
That's great.

121
00:05:14,617 --> 00:05:17,119
Everybody takes the subway
in New York.

122
00:05:17,121 --> 00:05:21,089
It's fast, it's efficient,
gets you there on time.

123
00:05:21,091 --> 00:05:22,157
It's a way to...

124
00:05:22,159 --> 00:05:23,558
Okay, there's a guy pooping

125
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:26,228
in a cardboard box down there.

126
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:28,897
This is the world-famous
Rockefeller Center.

127
00:05:28,899 --> 00:05:30,699
Founded, of course,
by Theodore Rockefeller.

128
00:05:30,701 --> 00:05:32,467
This is the skating rink.

129
00:05:32,469 --> 00:05:36,471
And I think the Rangers
practice there sometimes.

130
00:05:36,473 --> 00:05:39,641
And it's... that's Tina Fey.

131
00:05:39,643 --> 00:05:42,344
That's Tina Fey
from Saturday Night Live.

132
00:05:43,513 --> 00:05:45,113
Hello. Hello.

133
00:05:45,115 --> 00:05:47,616
Hi. Oh, I'm s...
I'm sorry.

134
00:05:47,618 --> 00:05:51,086
I thought you were...
Okay.

135
00:05:51,088 --> 00:05:55,023
She looked like... she looked
a lot like Tina Fey.

136
00:05:55,025 --> 00:05:56,358
Hello. Hello.

137
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:59,528
I thought that was Tina Fey,
but it wasn't.

138
00:05:59,530 --> 00:06:00,929
Are you serious?

139
00:06:00,931 --> 00:06:02,464
He was here?

140
00:06:02,466 --> 00:06:04,633
When? When I was talking
to the fake Tina Fey?

141
00:06:04,635 --> 00:06:06,435
Come on! No, s...

142
00:06:11,007 --> 00:06:12,541
Hello, Angela.
Did you her?

143
00:06:12,543 --> 00:06:14,076
Somebody totally
rocked the house

144
00:06:14,078 --> 00:06:15,977
and got me the best present
I've ever gotten.

145
00:06:15,979 --> 00:06:18,513
Really? I wouldn't know
anything about that.

146
00:06:18,515 --> 00:06:20,315
But I'm glad you enjoyed it.

147
00:06:20,317 --> 00:06:22,351
Oh, I did. I did.

148
00:06:22,353 --> 00:06:24,319
I didn't get anything
for Valentine's Day.

149
00:06:24,321 --> 00:06:26,321
Oh, I bet you will
before the day is over.

150
00:06:26,323 --> 00:06:29,758
Really?
Well, I hope I do.

151
00:06:36,499 --> 00:06:39,401
I would love to live
in New York some day.

152
00:06:39,403 --> 00:06:41,236
It's a big dream of mine.

153
00:06:41,238 --> 00:06:42,838
Work corporate with Jan.

154
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:44,039
Be awesome.

155
00:06:44,041 --> 00:06:46,842
Go to Broadway shows,
eat hotdogs.

156
00:06:46,844 --> 00:06:48,043
Scranton is great,

157
00:06:48,045 --> 00:06:52,414
but New York is like
Scranton on acid.

158
00:06:52,416 --> 00:06:54,282
No, on speed.
Nah.

159
00:06:55,184 --> 00:06:57,152
On steroids.

160
00:06:57,154 --> 00:07:00,255
Okay. Um, I think...

161
00:07:01,324 --> 00:07:03,325
that's either the Hudson
or the East.

162
00:07:03,327 --> 00:07:05,994
So we're back... should be
back this way.

163
00:07:07,997 --> 00:07:10,799
There is a lot of pressure
on me right now.

164
00:07:10,801 --> 00:07:13,635
It's like Michael Jordan
in the NBA finals

165
00:07:13,637 --> 00:07:16,638
or like Stormin'
Norman Schwarzkopf.

166
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:19,174
And this presentation
is Desert Storm.

167
00:07:19,176 --> 00:07:21,143
And as soon as it's over,

168
00:07:21,145 --> 00:07:24,079
we will not have to deal
with those Iraqis anymore.

169
00:07:24,081 --> 00:07:25,580
Let's do it.

170
00:07:27,785 --> 00:07:30,252
No, that's all right. Spend money
on her instead of giving it to us.

171
00:07:30,254 --> 00:07:31,319
That's fine.

172
00:07:32,255 --> 00:07:34,756
No, I didn't even have
a seat for you anyway.

173
00:07:34,758 --> 00:07:35,824
Yeah.

174
00:07:36,325 --> 00:07:37,726
All right, man.

175
00:07:37,728 --> 00:07:40,595
Okay, have a good night.
Bye.

176
00:07:48,472 --> 00:07:50,272
Whoa, whoa.

177
00:07:50,973 --> 00:07:52,174
Phyllis Lapin?

178
00:07:52,176 --> 00:07:53,909
Holy God.
It's from Bob.

179
00:07:53,911 --> 00:07:56,244
Man, that thing's
bigger than I am.

180
00:07:56,246 --> 00:07:58,680
No, it's not.
Oh, zip it.

181
00:07:58,682 --> 00:07:59,781
There they are.

182
00:07:59,783 --> 00:08:00,782
What's up?

183
00:08:00,784 --> 00:08:01,850
Hey.
Hey hey.

184
00:08:01,852 --> 00:08:02,951
Michael Scott.
Josh Porter.

185
00:08:02,953 --> 00:08:05,620
Hi five.

186
00:08:05,622 --> 00:08:07,088
Bam.

187
00:08:07,090 --> 00:08:08,557
You know Dan Gordon
from Buffalo.

188
00:08:08,559 --> 00:08:09,825
Yeah, how you doing?

189
00:08:09,827 --> 00:08:11,159
Nobody needs
to introduce this guy.

190
00:08:11,161 --> 00:08:12,294
Craigers.

191
00:08:12,296 --> 00:08:13,728
Oh.
What's up, buddy?

192
00:08:13,730 --> 00:08:16,031
You have been kicked out
of every strip club in Albany,

193
00:08:16,033 --> 00:08:17,432
is that true?
Guilty. Yeah.

194
00:08:17,434 --> 00:08:19,301
So what's going on?
What'd I miss?

195
00:08:19,303 --> 00:08:21,603
Not much. They're, uh,
I guess running late upstairs.

196
00:08:21,605 --> 00:08:24,239
So we're just waiting
for the presentations.

197
00:08:24,241 --> 00:08:25,907
Cool. Good. Good.
Good.

198
00:08:25,909 --> 00:08:28,510
Give us some time
to catch up and...

199
00:08:32,782 --> 00:08:34,749
Pam, hi.
How you doing? Good.

200
00:08:34,751 --> 00:08:36,751
Listen, uh,
may I speak with you...

201
00:08:36,753 --> 00:08:38,920
privately?

202
00:08:38,922 --> 00:08:40,222
You can't fire me, Dwight,

203
00:08:40,224 --> 00:08:41,490
just 'cause Michael's not here.

204
00:08:41,492 --> 00:08:43,458
No, Pam, just, um...

205
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:45,727
Just...

206
00:08:47,096 --> 00:08:49,498
You need to get something
for your girlfriend?

207
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:50,866
Girlfriend. Yes.

208
00:08:50,868 --> 00:08:52,567
And the reason I didn't
get anything

209
00:08:52,569 --> 00:08:54,736
for this particular person...
who shall remain nameless...

210
00:08:54,738 --> 00:08:57,439
is that she's not really
the kind of person

211
00:08:57,441 --> 00:08:59,808
you'd think would be
in to Valentine's Day.

212
00:08:59,810 --> 00:09:01,376
She's kind of...

213
00:09:01,378 --> 00:09:03,411
Tightly wound?

214
00:09:05,248 --> 00:09:06,515
Exactly.

215
00:09:06,883 --> 00:09:08,350
Okay.

216
00:09:08,352 --> 00:09:11,186
Well, sometimes the gift
is really about the gesture,

217
00:09:11,188 --> 00:09:12,821
you know, like what it means

218
00:09:12,823 --> 00:09:13,889
instead of what it is.

219
00:09:13,891 --> 00:09:17,392
You mean like a ham?

220
00:09:18,094 --> 00:09:19,227
No.

221
00:09:19,229 --> 00:09:20,795
Not like a ham.

222
00:09:21,797 --> 00:09:24,666
It's about doing something
so that the person knows

223
00:09:24,668 --> 00:09:26,468
that you really care about her.

224
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:28,670
That you remember her. Okay, I get it.
That's great.

225
00:09:28,672 --> 00:09:30,071
Okay, shut up.
I know exactly what to do.

226
00:09:34,243 --> 00:09:35,343
How about you, Craig?

227
00:09:35,345 --> 00:09:36,645
Did you lose anyone?

228
00:09:36,647 --> 00:09:38,313
Oh man. Jan called me
in September.

229
00:09:38,315 --> 00:09:40,248
And she's like you gotta
fire four people.

230
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:42,050
And I was just like, what?
You know.

231
00:09:43,986 --> 00:09:45,186
Did you?

232
00:09:45,188 --> 00:09:46,721
No. I just ignored her.

233
00:09:46,723 --> 00:09:48,290
She's the worst.

234
00:09:48,292 --> 00:09:49,791
She is our boss.

235
00:09:49,793 --> 00:09:51,059
She ain't my boss, dude.

236
00:09:51,061 --> 00:09:52,394
I don't work for that bitch.

237
00:09:52,396 --> 00:09:53,762
Hey, ca... ca... come on.

238
00:09:53,764 --> 00:09:55,397
You know, that's not...
Just cool it.

239
00:09:55,399 --> 00:09:57,532
You like Jan?
How can you like Jan?

240
00:09:57,534 --> 00:09:59,434
Maybe because she's
my girlfriend.

241
00:10:01,971 --> 00:10:04,973
Was or not my girlfriend.

242
00:10:04,975 --> 00:10:06,374
We hooked up and...

243
00:10:06,376 --> 00:10:07,742
You hooked up with Jan?

244
00:10:07,744 --> 00:10:09,344
That was just,
you know, months ago.

245
00:10:09,346 --> 00:10:11,112
It was just once.

246
00:10:11,114 --> 00:10:12,480
God, it's just stupid.

247
00:10:12,482 --> 00:10:14,049
Just forget it.

248
00:10:14,051 --> 00:10:15,584
Yeah, let's change the subject.

249
00:10:15,586 --> 00:10:16,918
Yeah, yeah.

250
00:10:19,855 --> 00:10:21,256
I don't know what he's thinking,

251
00:10:21,258 --> 00:10:22,857
but I would just be so psyched

252
00:10:22,859 --> 00:10:23,959
if we just dated forever.

253
00:10:23,961 --> 00:10:26,261
Well, take it slow.

254
00:10:26,263 --> 00:10:28,129
'Cause it seems like
a lot of the time,

255
00:10:28,131 --> 00:10:30,165
things like that need to...

256
00:10:33,369 --> 00:10:34,703
Soda.

257
00:10:34,705 --> 00:10:36,338
Cool.

258
00:10:38,941 --> 00:10:42,744
Hey, so do you want
to do something tonight?

259
00:10:42,746 --> 00:10:46,047
Oh, no, not while I'm here.

260
00:10:46,049 --> 00:10:48,483
I mean, I know that it's
Valentine's Day or whatever,

261
00:10:48,485 --> 00:10:50,185
but there's totally
no pressure at all

262
00:10:50,187 --> 00:10:51,987
of any kind whatsoever.

263
00:10:51,989 --> 00:10:54,723
I can't tonight.
I have plans with my friends.

264
00:10:54,725 --> 00:10:56,891
Okay. That's cool.

265
00:10:56,893 --> 00:11:00,195
I completely understand.
Okay. Cool.

266
00:11:00,197 --> 00:11:01,529
Okay.

267
00:11:22,585 --> 00:11:24,452
Josh Porter, Stanford.

268
00:11:24,454 --> 00:11:26,688
And Michael Scott, Scranton.

269
00:11:26,690 --> 00:11:28,023
Nice to meet you.
Ditto.

270
00:11:28,025 --> 00:11:29,124
How are you, Jan?

271
00:11:29,126 --> 00:11:30,925
Fine, Michael. Thank you.

272
00:11:30,927 --> 00:11:33,828
Okay. So we are
in the process

273
00:11:33,830 --> 00:11:35,163
of doing a complete review

274
00:11:35,165 --> 00:11:37,165
of the company's
financial strength.

275
00:11:37,167 --> 00:11:38,533
All I'd like to do today...

276
00:11:38,535 --> 00:11:39,968
Nervous?
No, I'm not nervous.

277
00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:41,703
Well, I mean,
I guess I'd be lying

278
00:11:41,705 --> 00:11:43,538
if I didn't say
I was a little nervous.

279
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:45,573
Um, the new CFO
is judging me on this too.

280
00:11:45,575 --> 00:11:46,775
And, well, it is Michael.

281
00:11:46,777 --> 00:11:50,979
So, yeah, I'm very nervous.

282
00:11:50,981 --> 00:11:53,014
So with the 12
new local accounts,

283
00:11:53,016 --> 00:11:56,017
we had a total
of 4% organic growth,

284
00:11:56,019 --> 00:11:58,687
which was just above
our pre-year targets.

285
00:11:58,689 --> 00:12:00,188
Thanks very much.
Thank you.

286
00:12:00,190 --> 00:12:02,424
Okay, Michael.

287
00:12:08,564 --> 00:12:10,365
What is a business?

288
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:14,769
Is it a collection of numbers
and sales reports?

289
00:12:14,771 --> 00:12:16,104
Sure.

290
00:12:16,106 --> 00:12:17,539
But as you know,

291
00:12:17,541 --> 00:12:19,140
David and Jan,

292
00:12:19,142 --> 00:12:21,176
it is much more.

293
00:12:38,728 --> 00:12:42,864
Life moves a little slower
in Scranton, Pennsylvania.

294
00:12:42,866 --> 00:12:45,400
And that's the way we like it.

295
00:12:45,402 --> 00:12:47,402
'Cause at Dunder Mifflin,
Scranton,

296
00:12:47,404 --> 00:12:50,605
we're not just
in the paper business,

297
00:12:50,607 --> 00:12:52,874
we're in the people business.

298
00:12:52,876 --> 00:12:54,809
Let's meet some of the folks

299
00:12:54,811 --> 00:12:58,913
who make the Scranton
branch so special.

300
00:12:58,915 --> 00:13:00,915
This is Stanley Hudson,

301
00:13:00,917 --> 00:13:02,917
one of our talented salesmen.

302
00:13:02,919 --> 00:13:05,887
An African-American
father of two,

303
00:13:05,889 --> 00:13:07,489
Stanley's dedication

304
00:13:07,491 --> 00:13:09,257
is no doubt one of the hallmarks

305
00:13:09,259 --> 00:13:11,059
of the foundation
of the business

306
00:13:11,061 --> 00:13:13,094
we're hoping to build
our basis on.

307
00:13:14,130 --> 00:13:16,898
Yeah, I shot a bunch
of footage around the office,

308
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:18,900
edited it together on my Mac.

309
00:13:18,902 --> 00:13:21,236
Was thinking about
entering it in some festivals.

310
00:13:21,238 --> 00:13:22,370
Probably won't.

311
00:13:22,372 --> 00:13:24,405
You know, not what this
is about.

312
00:13:25,541 --> 00:13:27,976
And finally, Pam Beesly.

313
00:13:27,978 --> 00:13:29,277
Look at her.

314
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:30,578
Look how cute.

315
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:33,047
Not bad at all.

316
00:13:33,049 --> 00:13:34,649
As the receptionist,

317
00:13:34,651 --> 00:13:38,953
Pam is truly the gateway
to our world.

318
00:13:38,955 --> 00:13:41,990
Well, I hope this gave you
a little taste

319
00:13:41,992 --> 00:13:45,360
of what life is like here
at Dunder Mifflin, Scranton.

320
00:13:45,362 --> 00:13:48,696
What it's like to walk
a mile in Oscar's shoes.

321
00:13:48,698 --> 00:13:51,399
Or try on Phyllis' pants.

322
00:13:51,401 --> 00:13:53,635
Next time you're in town,
give us a call.

323
00:13:53,637 --> 00:13:55,570
Stop on by.

324
00:13:55,572 --> 00:13:57,806
I'm sure you'll be greeted
by a big smile

325
00:13:57,808 --> 00:13:59,507
and a "How you doing, pal?"

326
00:13:59,509 --> 00:14:02,110
Maybe even one of Angela's
famous brownies.

327
00:14:02,112 --> 00:14:05,747
And you'll know
that you're home.

328
00:14:15,391 --> 00:14:16,724
Great Scott!

329
00:14:18,561 --> 00:14:19,627
Questions.

330
00:14:22,131 --> 00:14:23,231
Wow.

331
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,868
Okay. Okay,
thank you, Michael.

332
00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:28,636
That was great.
Yes, thank you.

333
00:14:28,638 --> 00:14:29,637
But for right now,

334
00:14:29,639 --> 00:14:31,339
what I'd really like
to know about

335
00:14:31,341 --> 00:14:33,374
is the branch's performance.

336
00:14:33,376 --> 00:14:35,743
So do you have
that information as well?

337
00:14:36,679 --> 00:14:38,680
Yes, absolutely, David.

338
00:14:38,682 --> 00:14:41,149
Get that for you.

339
00:14:47,089 --> 00:14:48,356
Can you sign?

340
00:14:48,358 --> 00:14:49,424
Yeah.

341
00:14:50,092 --> 00:14:51,159
Oscar.

342
00:14:51,627 --> 00:14:52,894
Nothing for me?

343
00:14:52,896 --> 00:14:54,128
Join the club.

344
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:58,666
Who's it from?

345
00:14:58,668 --> 00:15:00,401
My mom.

346
00:15:12,214 --> 00:15:13,548
It's frustrating 'cause we'd be

347
00:15:13,550 --> 00:15:15,283
so perfect together.

348
00:15:15,285 --> 00:15:18,086
You know what?
Here's the deal, Kelly.

349
00:15:18,088 --> 00:15:20,788
It would be really nice
if he was into you, right?

350
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:22,790
It would be great.

351
00:15:22,792 --> 00:15:23,858
But he isn't.

352
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:25,927
Yeah, but it would be
so great if he was.

353
00:15:25,929 --> 00:15:27,262
Well, he's not though.

354
00:15:27,264 --> 00:15:28,897
So you just gotta suck it up.

355
00:15:28,899 --> 00:15:31,165
You just gotta move on.
Try to have some fun.

356
00:15:31,167 --> 00:15:33,434
Come to my poker game tonight.

357
00:15:33,436 --> 00:15:35,069
Okay, cool.

358
00:15:35,071 --> 00:15:37,672
Is it okay if I invite Ryan?

359
00:15:45,214 --> 00:15:46,848
And that about does it.
Thank you.

360
00:15:46,850 --> 00:15:50,151
Okay. Craig.

361
00:15:50,819 --> 00:15:52,420
Yeah. Here's the deal.

362
00:15:53,623 --> 00:15:55,757
I did not understand
this was supposed to be

363
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:59,260
a full on like report
or whatnot.

364
00:15:59,262 --> 00:16:00,628
I'm sorry.

365
00:16:00,630 --> 00:16:03,765
What did you think
"financial presentation" meant?

366
00:16:03,767 --> 00:16:05,333
I was under the impression

367
00:16:05,335 --> 00:16:08,569
this was more of like
a meet-and-greet type deal.

368
00:16:08,571 --> 00:16:11,072
So does that mean
that you don't have

369
00:16:11,074 --> 00:16:12,774
the numbers on your branch?

370
00:16:12,776 --> 00:16:14,275
That is correct. Yes.

371
00:16:14,277 --> 00:16:16,611
Craig, you realize

372
00:16:16,613 --> 00:16:18,479
that we are trying to decide
whether drastic steps

373
00:16:18,481 --> 00:16:19,781
need to be taken.

374
00:16:19,783 --> 00:16:21,449
Look, I'm sorry.
I didn't know.

375
00:16:21,451 --> 00:16:23,351
Well, the point is
that this doesn't exactly

376
00:16:23,353 --> 00:16:24,852
bode well for your branch.

377
00:16:24,854 --> 00:16:26,087
Oh, man.

378
00:16:26,089 --> 00:16:28,089
You know what?
Michael made that stupid movie.

379
00:16:28,091 --> 00:16:29,624
He doesn't get in any trouble.

380
00:16:29,626 --> 00:16:31,726
Maybe I should've slept
with you too.

381
00:16:37,566 --> 00:16:39,133
Okay. Okay.
All right.

382
00:16:39,135 --> 00:16:40,802
No, no, no, I'm not...
I just...

383
00:16:40,804 --> 00:16:44,138
I just don't know
what to do anymore, Michael.

384
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:46,207
I mean, I'm probably
going to get fired.

385
00:16:46,209 --> 00:16:47,976
No, you're not.

386
00:16:47,978 --> 00:16:50,044
Michael, the CFO thinks
that we slept together.

387
00:16:50,046 --> 00:16:53,047
Don't you understand?
People get fired for much less.

388
00:16:53,049 --> 00:16:54,849
And I just can't believe

389
00:16:54,851 --> 00:16:56,117
that you told everybody.

390
00:16:56,119 --> 00:16:59,187
And we didn't even
sleep together.

391
00:16:59,189 --> 00:17:01,923
Technically,
we fell asleep in the same bed.

392
00:17:01,925 --> 00:17:03,124
Oh, God.

393
00:17:03,126 --> 00:17:06,361
Michael, it was months ago.
It was once.

394
00:17:06,363 --> 00:17:09,130
It's over.

395
00:17:09,132 --> 00:17:11,265
Do you understand?

396
00:17:12,868 --> 00:17:14,002
Yes.

397
00:17:14,004 --> 00:17:17,538
I'm sorry.

398
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:20,308
I'll fix this.
I'll talk to him.

399
00:17:20,310 --> 00:17:21,376
I'll talk to David.

400
00:17:21,378 --> 00:17:24,779
Surely, you cannot be serious.

401
00:17:24,781 --> 00:17:27,548
I am serious,
and don't call me Shirley.

402
00:17:27,550 --> 00:17:28,783
Airplane.

403
00:17:37,893 --> 00:17:39,961
Women are like wolves.

404
00:17:39,963 --> 00:17:42,797
If you want a wolf,
you have to trap it.

405
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:44,766
You have to snare it.

406
00:17:44,768 --> 00:17:48,169
And then you have to tame it.

407
00:17:48,171 --> 00:17:50,104
Keep it happy.
Care for it. Feed it.

408
00:17:50,106 --> 00:17:53,541
Lovingly the way an animal
deserves to be loved.

409
00:17:55,477 --> 00:17:58,913
And my animal deserves
a lot of loving.

410
00:18:02,618 --> 00:18:03,751
Hey, babe.

411
00:18:03,753 --> 00:18:05,720
You, uh, almost ready to go?

412
00:18:05,722 --> 00:18:07,688
I guess, yeah.

413
00:18:07,690 --> 00:18:09,190
What's wrong?

414
00:18:09,192 --> 00:18:10,324
Nothing.

415
00:18:10,326 --> 00:18:12,326
It's just that I had
to sit here all day

416
00:18:12,328 --> 00:18:13,694
while Phyllis got
like an entire garden

417
00:18:13,696 --> 00:18:14,796
delivered to her.

418
00:18:14,798 --> 00:18:16,264
What, you're mad at me?

419
00:18:16,266 --> 00:18:19,233
I mean, I know
that we said no big gifts,

420
00:18:19,235 --> 00:18:21,402
but I was kind of hoping
you'd get me something

421
00:18:21,404 --> 00:18:22,737
for Valentine's Day.

422
00:18:22,739 --> 00:18:24,906
Well, Valentine's Day
isn't over.

423
00:18:24,908 --> 00:18:26,441
Let's get you home,

424
00:18:26,443 --> 00:18:29,077
and you are gonna get
the best sex of your life.

425
00:18:32,247 --> 00:18:34,515
You understand this is
a very serious situation.

426
00:18:34,517 --> 00:18:36,284
No, no, no.
Yes, I... Okay, well...

427
00:18:36,286 --> 00:18:37,452
All right, here's the deal.

428
00:18:37,454 --> 00:18:39,520
This is my fault.
This is totally on me.

429
00:18:39,522 --> 00:18:40,855
Before you guys came in,

430
00:18:40,857 --> 00:18:43,024
I was talking to the guys,
we were all chatting.

431
00:18:43,026 --> 00:18:45,326
And I made a joke.

432
00:18:45,328 --> 00:18:46,661
A really dumb joke.

433
00:18:46,663 --> 00:18:48,563
And Craig the idiot
took it seriously.

434
00:18:48,565 --> 00:18:50,531
You made a joke?
I did.

435
00:18:50,533 --> 00:18:51,699
It was stupid.

436
00:18:51,701 --> 00:18:53,167
And Craig, you saw him,

437
00:18:53,169 --> 00:18:55,670
he's not the sharpest tool
in the shed.

438
00:18:55,672 --> 00:18:57,872
Although he is a tool.

439
00:18:57,874 --> 00:18:59,707
Well, I don't need
to explain to you

440
00:18:59,709 --> 00:19:01,442
that even a joke
about sexual relations

441
00:19:01,444 --> 00:19:03,144
with your boss...

442
00:19:03,146 --> 00:19:04,812
I know.
It was borderline at best.

443
00:19:04,814 --> 00:19:08,850
And... and Jan
is a fantastic executive

444
00:19:08,852 --> 00:19:10,818
and has all the integrity
in the world.

445
00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:14,322
And, um, I'm really sorry.

446
00:19:14,324 --> 00:19:17,258
It'll never happen again.

447
00:19:18,927 --> 00:19:20,795
Uh, it's fine.

448
00:19:20,797 --> 00:19:23,331
Let's just, uh, just forget it.

449
00:19:23,333 --> 00:19:25,666
Good.

450
00:19:35,644 --> 00:19:37,378
Heading out?

451
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:38,713
Yeah.

452
00:19:38,715 --> 00:19:40,348
All right, Beesly.

453
00:19:40,350 --> 00:19:42,717
Hey, happy Valentine's Day.

454
00:19:43,485 --> 00:19:45,052
Bye.

455
00:19:49,091 --> 00:19:50,625
Good night, Pam.

456
00:19:50,627 --> 00:19:52,493
Night, Phyllis.

457
00:19:56,665 --> 00:19:58,232
Uh, Michael.

458
00:19:58,234 --> 00:20:00,268
Thank you again
for that, really.

459
00:20:00,270 --> 00:20:01,469
It was very nice.

460
00:20:01,471 --> 00:20:03,671
Oh, no big deal.
Really. Sorry again.

461
00:20:03,673 --> 00:20:07,008
Oh, no.
It's... it's okay.

462
00:20:07,010 --> 00:20:09,510
So, uh, happy Valentine's Day.

463
00:20:09,512 --> 00:20:11,979
Yeah, happy Valentine's Day.

464
00:20:25,294 --> 00:20:26,360
Oh.

465
00:20:31,033 --> 00:20:33,901
Oi vey... schmear.
