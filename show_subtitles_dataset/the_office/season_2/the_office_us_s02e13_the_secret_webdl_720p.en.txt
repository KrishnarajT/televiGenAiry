1
00:00:00,797 --> 00:00:01,797
Nothing much.
What's up with you?

2
00:00:01,799 --> 00:00:03,098
I cannot believe
I feel for that.

3
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:05,334
Gosh.

4
00:00:05,336 --> 00:00:07,102
Ha ha. What?

5
00:00:07,104 --> 00:00:09,104
What?
Where's the funny?

6
00:00:09,106 --> 00:00:11,106
Give it to me.

7
00:00:11,108 --> 00:00:15,311
Um, is it me or does it
smell like updog in here?

8
00:00:15,313 --> 00:00:16,412
What's updog?

9
00:00:16,414 --> 00:00:19,281
Nothing much.
What's up with you?

10
00:00:19,283 --> 00:00:21,517
Oh, wow.

11
00:00:21,519 --> 00:00:23,986
I walked right into that.

12
00:00:23,988 --> 00:00:26,589
Oh, that's brilliant.

13
00:00:26,591 --> 00:00:28,824
Hey, Stanley.
Is that jacket made of updog?

14
00:00:28,826 --> 00:00:30,793
I'm on the phone.

15
00:00:32,797 --> 00:00:34,330
Mm!

16
00:00:34,332 --> 00:00:37,032
What flavor coffee
is that, updog?

17
00:00:37,034 --> 00:00:38,334
What's that?

18
00:00:38,336 --> 00:00:41,103
I don't know. Nothing.
What's up with you?

19
00:00:41,105 --> 00:00:43,672
Huh? No. Damn it.

20
00:00:43,674 --> 00:00:45,307
What does that mean?

21
00:00:45,309 --> 00:00:46,308
What does what mean?

22
00:00:46,310 --> 00:00:47,610
That thing you just said.

23
00:00:47,612 --> 00:00:49,011
Just forget it.

24
00:00:49,013 --> 00:00:50,412
Dwight.

25
00:00:50,414 --> 00:00:51,747
Hey, is it me,

26
00:00:51,749 --> 00:00:54,450
or does this place
smell like updog?

27
00:00:54,452 --> 00:00:55,451
What's updog?

28
00:00:55,453 --> 00:00:57,019
Gotcha!

29
00:00:57,021 --> 00:00:58,821
Oh, God!

30
00:00:58,823 --> 00:01:00,589
Crap.

31
00:01:02,993 --> 00:01:05,427
Nothing.
How are you doing?

32
00:01:05,429 --> 00:01:07,897
Good.
How are you doing?

33
00:01:07,899 --> 00:01:09,865
Mm.

34
00:01:51,007 --> 00:01:53,976
Today is spring cleaning day
here at Dunder-Mifflin.

35
00:01:53,978 --> 00:01:56,278
And yes, I know it's January.
I am not an idiot.

36
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:58,847
But if you do your spring
cleaning in January,

37
00:01:58,849 --> 00:02:01,050
guess what you don't have
to do in the spring?

38
00:02:01,052 --> 00:02:03,585
Anything.

39
00:02:03,587 --> 00:02:05,988
They say a cluttered desk
means a cluttered mind.

40
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:08,457
Well, I say an empty desk
means an...

41
00:02:08,459 --> 00:02:09,858
Empty mind.

42
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:11,126
No, that's not...
No.

43
00:02:11,128 --> 00:02:13,295
That's not what I was gonna say.

44
00:02:13,297 --> 00:02:15,130
Meredith, men's room.

45
00:02:15,132 --> 00:02:17,299
Make sure you replace
the urinal cakes.

46
00:02:17,301 --> 00:02:18,434
They're worn down.

47
00:02:18,436 --> 00:02:20,636
Kevin, file drawers.

48
00:02:20,638 --> 00:02:23,405
Angela, kitchen.

49
00:02:23,407 --> 00:02:25,941
Oscar, dusting.
Where is Oscar?

50
00:02:25,943 --> 00:02:27,109
He's out sick.

51
00:02:27,111 --> 00:02:29,311
That's unacceptable.

52
00:02:29,313 --> 00:02:33,315
I agree.
It's unacceptable.

53
00:02:36,786 --> 00:02:39,755
What are you guys doing?

54
00:02:40,623 --> 00:02:43,258
Michael.
- Yes.

55
00:02:45,128 --> 00:02:48,330
Oscar is out sick.

56
00:02:48,332 --> 00:02:51,000
On a Friday?

57
00:02:56,006 --> 00:02:58,040
- Can I do some of the talking?
- I will do the talking.

58
00:02:58,042 --> 00:02:59,208
Okay, let him know
that I'm here though.

59
00:02:59,210 --> 00:03:02,111
- What difference does it make whether you're here?
- Hello?

60
00:03:02,113 --> 00:03:03,679
Hi, Oscar, it's Michael.

61
00:03:03,681 --> 00:03:05,447
And Dwight.

62
00:03:05,449 --> 00:03:07,483
Yeah, um, heard you were
under the weather.

63
00:03:07,485 --> 00:03:09,518
Yeah, I think I came down
with the flu.

64
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:11,920
Really. Oh, that is a shame.

65
00:03:11,922 --> 00:03:13,989
You know, it's cleaning day
here today.

66
00:03:13,991 --> 00:03:16,458
Could've used some of that
famous Hispanic cleaning ethic.

67
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:18,794
Yeah, I feel terrible about it.

68
00:03:18,796 --> 00:03:20,429
Ask for his symptoms...
I'm on WebMD.

69
00:03:20,431 --> 00:03:22,531
What are your symptoms?

70
00:03:22,533 --> 00:03:24,933
I have the chills,
I'm feeling nauseous,

71
00:03:24,935 --> 00:03:26,835
and my head's killing.

72
00:03:28,738 --> 00:03:30,506
Checks out.

73
00:03:30,508 --> 00:03:32,207
Michael, is there anything
you need from me?

74
00:03:32,209 --> 00:03:33,542
I would like to go back to bed.

75
00:03:33,544 --> 00:03:35,811
I need you to go to bed.
I need you to get better.

76
00:03:35,813 --> 00:03:37,880
See you Monday,
unless you're still sick.

77
00:03:37,882 --> 00:03:39,348
So, have a great long weekend.

78
00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:42,351
I'll just be sleep...

79
00:03:42,353 --> 00:03:43,819
Okay, first impressions.

80
00:03:43,821 --> 00:03:45,254
He sounded sick.

81
00:03:45,256 --> 00:03:46,488
Which is exactly how you'd
want to sound

82
00:03:46,490 --> 00:03:48,090
if you wanted someone
to think you were sick.

83
00:03:48,092 --> 00:03:49,625
That's exactly what
I was thinking.

84
00:03:49,627 --> 00:03:51,794
Question, may I investigate?

85
00:03:51,796 --> 00:03:55,664
Yeah, drop what you're doing.
Make this a priority.

86
00:03:55,666 --> 00:03:58,267
Because an office can't
function efficiently

87
00:03:58,269 --> 00:04:01,737
unless people are at their desks
doing their jobs.

88
00:04:01,739 --> 00:04:03,072
I bought my veil.

89
00:04:03,074 --> 00:04:05,307
Oh, my God, that is so exciting.

90
00:04:05,309 --> 00:04:06,375
Can I be a bridesmaid?

91
00:04:06,377 --> 00:04:08,677
Um...

92
00:04:08,679 --> 00:04:09,978
Listen, you don't
have to answer now,

93
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:11,447
but how are you gonna
do your hair?

94
00:04:11,449 --> 00:04:14,550
Okay, I was thinking about
wearing it down.

95
00:04:14,552 --> 00:04:17,319
Kinda like,
I don't know, like...

96
00:04:17,321 --> 00:04:18,687
loose with big curls.

97
00:04:18,689 --> 00:04:21,657
You look like an angel.
I'm seriously gonna cry.

98
00:04:21,659 --> 00:04:23,959
Wowie.
Mikey likey.

99
00:04:23,961 --> 00:04:26,095
Why don't you wear your hair
like that all the time?

100
00:04:26,097 --> 00:04:29,932
It's much sexier.

101
00:04:29,934 --> 00:04:32,401
Man, this must be
torture for you.

102
00:04:34,604 --> 00:04:36,105
Yeah, on the booze cruise,

103
00:04:36,107 --> 00:04:38,707
I told Michael about
some feelings

104
00:04:38,709 --> 00:04:40,709
I used to have for Pam.

105
00:04:40,711 --> 00:04:44,346
I had just broken up with Katie,
and had a couple of drinks,

106
00:04:44,348 --> 00:04:49,284
and I confided in the world's
worst confidant.

107
00:04:49,286 --> 00:04:53,088
Okay.

108
00:04:53,090 --> 00:04:54,690
Hey, Mike.

109
00:04:54,692 --> 00:04:55,924
Hey, Jim bag.

110
00:04:57,595 --> 00:05:00,462
Remember that thing I told you
on the booze cruise about Pam?

111
00:05:00,464 --> 00:05:02,764
That was personal.

112
00:05:02,766 --> 00:05:04,933
So, if we could just keep
that between you and me,

113
00:05:04,935 --> 00:05:06,135
that would be great.

114
00:05:06,137 --> 00:05:07,669
Really?
Mm-hmm.

115
00:05:07,671 --> 00:05:08,937
Who else knows?

116
00:05:08,939 --> 00:05:10,339
Nobody.

117
00:05:10,341 --> 00:05:12,107
Wow.

118
00:05:12,109 --> 00:05:13,575
Jim and I are great friends.

119
00:05:13,577 --> 00:05:15,377
We hang out a ton.

120
00:05:15,379 --> 00:05:17,179
Mostly at work.

121
00:05:17,181 --> 00:05:19,948
But the fact that he told me
his secret and no one else,

122
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:22,951
says everything about
our friendship.

123
00:05:22,953 --> 00:05:26,588
And it is why I intend
on keeping that secret

124
00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:28,323
for as long as I possibly can.

125
00:05:30,995 --> 00:05:32,394
Bangles.

126
00:05:32,396 --> 00:05:34,463
All right, great, thank you.

127
00:05:40,004 --> 00:05:44,907
Listen, temp, I am conducting
a little investigation.

128
00:05:44,909 --> 00:05:48,143
So, I am no longer gonna be able
to head up spring cleaning.

129
00:05:48,145 --> 00:05:49,545
Do you think you can handle it?

130
00:05:49,547 --> 00:05:50,913
Yeah, I think I can handle it.

131
00:05:50,915 --> 00:05:54,516
Do you think, or do you know?

132
00:05:54,518 --> 00:05:58,387
I think.

133
00:05:58,389 --> 00:06:02,024
Oh, God.
Here.

134
00:06:03,626 --> 00:06:05,027
Hey, whatcha getting?

135
00:06:05,029 --> 00:06:06,395
I'm going with grape.

136
00:06:06,397 --> 00:06:09,164
Ah, good stuff.
Good stuff.

137
00:06:09,166 --> 00:06:10,532
Yup.

138
00:06:10,534 --> 00:06:11,967
See the game last night?

139
00:06:11,969 --> 00:06:13,535
Which game?

140
00:06:13,537 --> 00:06:15,370
Any of 'em.

141
00:06:17,106 --> 00:06:19,474
So, uh, what's the 4-1-1?

142
00:06:19,476 --> 00:06:21,777
Any updates
on the "P" situation?

143
00:06:21,779 --> 00:06:23,212
I don't know what you mean...

144
00:06:23,214 --> 00:06:25,347
P-A-M...
P-A?

145
00:06:25,349 --> 00:06:26,915
Okay.

146
00:06:26,917 --> 00:06:28,050
No, it's okay.
We're talking code.

147
00:06:28,052 --> 00:06:29,251
Well...
What is?

148
00:06:29,253 --> 00:06:30,719
Listen, Stan...
how long does it take you

149
00:06:30,721 --> 00:06:31,954
for you to pick out a soda?

150
00:06:31,956 --> 00:06:33,622
I'm gonna take off, actually.

151
00:06:33,624 --> 00:06:35,390
All right, well.
Cool.

152
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:38,727
Still deciding?

153
00:06:38,729 --> 00:06:40,095
Hmm?

154
00:06:41,698 --> 00:06:43,732
Peach iced tea.

155
00:06:44,634 --> 00:06:46,301
You're gonna hate it.

156
00:06:46,303 --> 00:06:49,104
Hey, Oscar, how you doing?
Dwight Schrute calling.

157
00:06:49,106 --> 00:06:51,006
Listen, little question
for you, buddy.

158
00:06:51,008 --> 00:06:54,076
I called six minutes ago,
and no one answered.

159
00:06:54,078 --> 00:06:56,945
So I was wondering
if you could expl...

160
00:06:56,947 --> 00:06:58,680
Oh, I see.

161
00:06:58,682 --> 00:07:01,650
So, sounds like you're too sick
to come into work,

162
00:07:01,652 --> 00:07:03,952
but you're well enough
to go to the pharmacy.

163
00:07:03,954 --> 00:07:06,989
There are several different ways
to tell if a perp is lying.

164
00:07:06,991 --> 00:07:10,259
The liar will avoid
direct eye contact.

165
00:07:10,261 --> 00:07:14,830
The liar will cover part of his
or her face with his hand.

166
00:07:14,832 --> 00:07:16,898
Especially the mouth.

167
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:19,201
The liar will perspire.

168
00:07:21,004 --> 00:07:22,938
Unfortunately, I spoke
to Oscar on the phone.

169
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:25,240
So none of this is useful.

170
00:07:29,312 --> 00:07:33,348
It's grrrrape soda.

171
00:07:33,350 --> 00:07:35,217
Tony the Tiger, you don't hear
that much anymore.

172
00:07:35,219 --> 00:07:36,518
Not so much.

173
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:38,020
Okay, what is going on here?

174
00:07:38,022 --> 00:07:39,788
Nothing.

175
00:07:39,790 --> 00:07:41,490
Oh, really, nothing?

176
00:07:41,492 --> 00:07:42,891
Fact, you are
drinking grape soda.

177
00:07:42,893 --> 00:07:45,160
You never drink grape soda.

178
00:07:45,162 --> 00:07:47,362
Fact, you are talking to Jim,
you never talk to Jim.

179
00:07:47,364 --> 00:07:49,798
Fact, I love grape soda.
I always have.

180
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,933
Fact, Jim and I talk
all the time.

181
00:07:51,935 --> 00:07:54,102
We tell each other secrets.

182
00:07:54,104 --> 00:07:55,637
Okay, so what is the secret,
Michael?

183
00:07:55,639 --> 00:07:57,839
Um, I had asked Michael

184
00:07:57,841 --> 00:08:00,275
if I could head up the Oscar
investigation,

185
00:08:00,277 --> 00:08:03,845
and he said that only Dwight
was capable of handling

186
00:08:03,847 --> 00:08:06,481
such sensitive material.

187
00:08:08,518 --> 00:08:09,785
Is that true?

188
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:12,688
Um...

189
00:08:12,690 --> 00:08:18,226
I-I don't know.
Uh, yeah, yeah, it is.

190
00:08:18,228 --> 00:08:21,863
Thank you, Michael.
I know you're telling the truth.

191
00:08:21,865 --> 00:08:23,699
Okay.
I can tell.

192
00:08:23,701 --> 00:08:25,634
I won't let you down.

193
00:08:25,636 --> 00:08:27,703
Good.
Thanks.

194
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:33,709
Nice, that was... that was slick.
What're you doing for lunch?

195
00:08:33,711 --> 00:08:36,044
I don't know, I'm probably just
gonna eat my ham and cheese

196
00:08:36,046 --> 00:08:37,179
sandwich in the break room.

197
00:08:37,181 --> 00:08:39,181
Oh, nonsense.
No way, no.

198
00:08:39,183 --> 00:08:40,649
Why don't, uh...

199
00:08:40,651 --> 00:08:42,818
Why don't I take you
out to lunch? My treat.

200
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:44,419
Uh, no, that's all right.
Thank you, though.

201
00:08:44,421 --> 00:08:45,854
It's... I gotta do
some cleaning.

202
00:08:45,856 --> 00:08:47,155
I should probably
stick around here.

203
00:08:47,157 --> 00:08:48,724
Hey, you know what we could do?

204
00:08:48,726 --> 00:08:49,991
Spread out a blanket
in the break room,

205
00:08:49,993 --> 00:08:53,729
have a little picnic,
order some 'za.

206
00:08:53,731 --> 00:08:55,163
Talk about you-know-who.

207
00:08:55,165 --> 00:08:57,566
Oh, um, nope.
You know what, let's go out.

208
00:08:57,568 --> 00:08:58,700
That was a good idea.

209
00:08:58,702 --> 00:09:04,206
- Let's go out.
- I know just the place.

210
00:09:04,208 --> 00:09:07,275
Oh, man.
You should order milk.

211
00:09:07,277 --> 00:09:08,810
Get it?

212
00:09:10,179 --> 00:09:11,880
Why do I like Hooters?

213
00:09:12,615 --> 00:09:15,150
Well, I will give
you two reasons.

214
00:09:15,152 --> 00:09:17,285
The boobs and the hot wings.

215
00:09:20,323 --> 00:09:22,157
Oh, here we go.
Here we go.

216
00:09:22,159 --> 00:09:23,592
Bogie at three o'clock.
Hi.

217
00:09:23,594 --> 00:09:25,861
Hey, I'm Dana.
Welcome to Hooters.

218
00:09:25,863 --> 00:09:29,931
We're not worthy.
We're not worthy.

219
00:09:29,933 --> 00:09:31,666
Hello, Dana.

220
00:09:31,668 --> 00:09:34,569
I am Michael, and this is Jim.

221
00:09:34,571 --> 00:09:35,937
And we are brothers.

222
00:09:35,939 --> 00:09:37,906
Nope. We're not brothers.

223
00:09:37,908 --> 00:09:39,841
I'm his boss, actually.
And I treat him well.

224
00:09:39,843 --> 00:09:42,477
I'm taking him out to lunch
because I can afford it.

225
00:09:42,479 --> 00:09:44,212
And he can have
whatever he wants.

226
00:09:44,214 --> 00:09:46,148
I'll just have the ham
and cheese sandwich, thanks.

227
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:47,382
And for you?

228
00:09:47,384 --> 00:09:49,618
Tell me, Dana.
How is your chicken breast?

229
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:51,052
Oh, it's great.

230
00:09:51,054 --> 00:09:52,654
It's served with our
world-famous wing sauce.

231
00:09:52,656 --> 00:09:55,724
Mm, sounds yummy.
I will have a chicken breast.

232
00:09:55,726 --> 00:09:56,892
Hold the chicken.

233
00:09:59,062 --> 00:10:00,695
Is that what you really want?

234
00:10:03,966 --> 00:10:05,901
No, I'm gonna have
the gourmet hotdog.

235
00:10:05,903 --> 00:10:06,968
Great.

236
00:10:11,774 --> 00:10:13,775
Who took all the black ones?

237
00:10:13,777 --> 00:10:15,243
That's a communal bowl.

238
00:10:15,245 --> 00:10:18,079
So, how did Oscar sound
when he called in?

239
00:10:18,081 --> 00:10:20,982
Sick. Like, lots of sniffling.
I don't know.

240
00:10:20,984 --> 00:10:22,918
Sniffling how?

241
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:25,487
Um, how many different ways
are there to gonna sniffle?

242
00:10:25,489 --> 00:10:26,755
Three.

243
00:10:26,757 --> 00:10:29,257
Okay, it was the second one.

244
00:10:29,259 --> 00:10:30,759
Okay, good.
Thank you.

245
00:10:30,761 --> 00:10:32,160
That wasn't so hard, now was it?

246
00:10:32,162 --> 00:10:33,995
Mm-mm.

247
00:10:37,934 --> 00:10:40,302
What do you like best about Pam?

248
00:10:40,304 --> 00:10:41,903
Oh, I really don't wanna
talk about it.

249
00:10:41,905 --> 00:10:44,005
Her legs or boobs, or...?

250
00:10:44,007 --> 00:10:47,576
Um, she's easy
to talk to, I guess.

251
00:10:47,578 --> 00:10:50,212
And, uh, she's got a really good
sense of humor.

252
00:10:50,214 --> 00:10:52,013
Really?
Mm-hmm.

253
00:10:52,015 --> 00:10:53,348
She never gets any of my jokes.

254
00:10:53,350 --> 00:10:56,151
What about you?

255
00:10:56,153 --> 00:10:57,586
Her boobs, definitely.

256
00:10:57,588 --> 00:11:00,322
Wow, that's not what I meant.

257
00:11:00,324 --> 00:11:01,623
- Here you go.
- Oh, thank you.

258
00:11:01,625 --> 00:11:02,691
And I understand,

259
00:11:02,693 --> 00:11:04,493
We have a birthday today.

260
00:11:04,495 --> 00:11:07,662
- Oh, happy birthday, Jim.
- Ready, girls?

261
00:11:19,510 --> 00:11:21,042
Thank you.

262
00:11:21,044 --> 00:11:22,310
Whoo! Yeah!

263
00:11:22,312 --> 00:11:23,912
Thanks.
Thanks, Dana.

264
00:11:23,914 --> 00:11:26,548
Thank you very much.

265
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:27,616
Whew.

266
00:11:29,118 --> 00:11:30,719
That was hilarious. Hey.

267
00:11:30,721 --> 00:11:32,687
What did you guys talk about?

268
00:11:32,689 --> 00:11:36,291
Just, you know, politics.
Literature.

269
00:11:36,293 --> 00:11:37,559
I hate you.

270
00:11:39,562 --> 00:11:41,396
Quick Oscar update.

271
00:11:41,398 --> 00:11:43,198
I have conducted interviews
with everyone in the office...

272
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,000
Just go to his house
and see if he's sick.

273
00:11:45,002 --> 00:11:46,167
I could've done this
investigation in,

274
00:11:46,169 --> 00:11:47,335
like, 20 minutes.

275
00:11:47,337 --> 00:11:48,436
Including prep time?

276
00:11:48,438 --> 00:11:49,571
Just do it.

277
00:11:54,944 --> 00:11:58,580
If I had to, I could clean
out my desk in five seconds

278
00:11:58,582 --> 00:12:01,016
and nobody would ever know
I had ever been here.

279
00:12:02,285 --> 00:12:04,152
And I'd forget too.

280
00:12:15,398 --> 00:12:17,732
Expense this.

281
00:12:17,734 --> 00:12:18,833
Michael, is that a wig?

282
00:12:18,835 --> 00:12:21,536
No, it's...

283
00:12:21,538 --> 00:12:24,072
I wear it like that sometimes.

284
00:12:24,074 --> 00:12:25,473
Is that a wig?

285
00:12:25,475 --> 00:12:27,042
This is from Hooters.

286
00:12:27,044 --> 00:12:28,843
Yeah, it was a business lunch.

287
00:12:28,845 --> 00:12:30,011
Did Toby approve this?

288
00:12:30,013 --> 00:12:31,146
No, he did not.

289
00:12:31,148 --> 00:12:32,881
I don't need his permission.

290
00:12:32,883 --> 00:12:34,983
They just just got your
corporate credit card back.

291
00:12:34,985 --> 00:12:36,751
Do you really want me
to take it away again?

292
00:12:36,753 --> 00:12:38,320
It's ridiculous.

293
00:12:38,322 --> 00:12:39,754
They took my card away

294
00:12:39,756 --> 00:12:42,257
because I spent 80 bucks
at a magic shop.

295
00:12:42,259 --> 00:12:45,293
What they don't understand
is that I bought the stuff

296
00:12:45,295 --> 00:12:47,228
to impress potential clients.

297
00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:49,864
So business-related, right?

298
00:12:49,866 --> 00:12:52,667
I put a cigarette through
a freaking quarter.

299
00:12:52,669 --> 00:12:54,102
And you know what, Toby?

300
00:12:54,104 --> 00:12:55,670
They almost bought from us.

301
00:12:55,672 --> 00:12:57,372
I'm not processing this.

302
00:12:57,374 --> 00:13:00,308
Look, Jim needed
a relaxing lunch.

303
00:13:00,310 --> 00:13:01,743
He has been depressed.

304
00:13:01,745 --> 00:13:03,745
And it has been affecting
his productivity.

305
00:13:03,747 --> 00:13:05,113
How is that not work-related?

306
00:13:05,115 --> 00:13:06,715
He seems fine to me.

307
00:13:06,717 --> 00:13:08,249
You're not his friend.
You don't know.

308
00:13:08,251 --> 00:13:11,286
He is in love with a girl
he works with who's engaged.

309
00:13:11,288 --> 00:13:13,788
So just cut me some slack,
please.

310
00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:15,223
Pam?

311
00:13:23,966 --> 00:13:25,700
Hey, Angela,
who would you choose?

312
00:13:25,702 --> 00:13:26,935
Jim or Roy?

313
00:13:26,937 --> 00:13:28,436
It's nobody's business, Phyllis.

314
00:13:30,172 --> 00:13:32,073
Roy.

315
00:13:32,075 --> 00:13:34,843
Jim has got it bad for Pam.

316
00:13:34,845 --> 00:13:37,312
Oh-ho.
Which one is Pam?

317
00:13:37,314 --> 00:13:39,514
Well, she di...

318
00:13:39,516 --> 00:13:41,216
Hey, Michael?
Hmm?

319
00:13:41,218 --> 00:13:43,752
So do you think Jim will try
to break up the wedding?

320
00:13:43,754 --> 00:13:46,187
You know what, Kevin?
Jim is a friend of mine.

321
00:13:46,189 --> 00:13:49,190
So the only people that
this crush really concerns

322
00:13:49,192 --> 00:13:51,126
is Jim and Pam... and me.

323
00:13:53,129 --> 00:13:55,163
As a volunteer sheriff's deputy,

324
00:13:55,165 --> 00:13:57,132
I've been doing surveillance
for years.

325
00:13:57,134 --> 00:13:58,833
One time,

326
00:13:58,835 --> 00:14:01,836
I suspected an ex-girlfriend
of mine of cheating on me.

327
00:14:01,838 --> 00:14:04,239
So I tailed her
for six nights straight.

328
00:14:04,241 --> 00:14:06,541
Turns out she was.

329
00:14:06,543 --> 00:14:09,544
With a couple of guys,
actually, so.

330
00:14:12,081 --> 00:14:13,648
Mystery solved.

331
00:14:13,650 --> 00:14:17,986
Jim, why didn't you tell me
that you had a crush on Pam?

332
00:14:19,522 --> 00:14:21,156
Well, the cat's out of the bag.

333
00:14:21,158 --> 00:14:23,558
I used to have a crush on Pam.

334
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:26,494
And now I don't.

335
00:14:27,496 --> 00:14:28,997
Riveting.

336
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:32,233
Yeah.

337
00:14:32,235 --> 00:14:33,868
No, it's not.

338
00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:35,003
Nice.

339
00:14:36,806 --> 00:14:38,673
She is so hot.

340
00:14:43,446 --> 00:14:45,046
Hey.
Hey.

341
00:14:45,048 --> 00:14:47,482
Did you find anything good
in your desk?

342
00:14:47,484 --> 00:14:49,484
Uh, coupon for a free sandwich.

343
00:14:49,486 --> 00:14:51,653
- Score.
- Expired in August.

344
00:14:51,655 --> 00:14:53,888
And my cell phone charger
from two years ago.

345
00:14:53,890 --> 00:14:57,025
Big day.
Big day.

346
00:14:57,027 --> 00:14:59,227
Hey, uh, listen.

347
00:15:01,464 --> 00:15:02,530
Um...

348
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:08,002
I told Michael
on the booze cruise...

349
00:15:08,004 --> 00:15:09,637
So stupid.

350
00:15:09,639 --> 00:15:11,039
Um...

351
00:15:12,842 --> 00:15:16,845
I told Michael that I had
had a crush on you

352
00:15:16,847 --> 00:15:19,547
when you first started here.

353
00:15:19,549 --> 00:15:21,449
Oh.

354
00:15:21,451 --> 00:15:24,085
Well, I just thought that...

355
00:15:24,087 --> 00:15:26,921
I figured you should
hear it from me.

356
00:15:26,923 --> 00:15:30,492
Rather than, I mean,
you know Michael.

357
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:32,427
Right.

358
00:15:33,095 --> 00:15:35,263
And... seriously.

359
00:15:35,265 --> 00:15:37,999
It's totally not a big deal.

360
00:15:38,001 --> 00:15:39,334
Okay?

361
00:15:40,803 --> 00:15:43,438
And when I found out
that you were engaged, I mean...

362
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,406
No, I... I know.

363
00:15:45,408 --> 00:15:48,343
Like, I kind of...
Like, I...

364
00:15:48,345 --> 00:15:49,844
I thought that maybe you did.

365
00:15:49,846 --> 00:15:52,080
- When I first started.
- Oh, you did?

366
00:15:52,082 --> 00:15:54,282
No, I mean, just 'cause we,
like, got along so well.

367
00:15:54,284 --> 00:15:55,483
No, I know, yeah.

368
00:15:55,485 --> 00:15:56,818
You saw through me.
Great.

369
00:15:59,689 --> 00:16:01,823
So are you gonna be, like,
totally awkward around me now?

370
00:16:01,825 --> 00:16:03,091
Oh, yeah.

371
00:16:03,093 --> 00:16:04,392
Yeah.

372
00:16:05,528 --> 00:16:07,629
Hope that's okay.
Mm-hmm.

373
00:16:10,566 --> 00:16:12,066
And Pam.

374
00:16:12,068 --> 00:16:14,302
It was, like, three years ago.

375
00:16:14,304 --> 00:16:18,072
So I am totally over it.

376
00:16:18,074 --> 00:16:20,108
Cool.

377
00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:22,076
Okay.

378
00:16:34,590 --> 00:16:36,958
This is it. There he is.

379
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:39,260
He's been gone
for at least two...

380
00:16:39,262 --> 00:16:40,929
Who is that?

381
00:16:40,931 --> 00:16:42,297
Come to Papa.

382
00:16:42,299 --> 00:16:45,300
I got it. Close that.
You got those.

383
00:16:45,302 --> 00:16:48,837
Oh, yes. Oh, nice.

384
00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:50,171
Let's roll.

385
00:16:50,173 --> 00:16:51,940
I knew it!

386
00:16:56,312 --> 00:16:59,647
Oh, man, you are so busted.

387
00:16:59,649 --> 00:17:02,617
Ice-skates.
Shopping bags.

388
00:17:02,619 --> 00:17:05,520
I think I know what's
going on here.

389
00:17:05,522 --> 00:17:07,288
You weren't sick at all.

390
00:17:07,290 --> 00:17:09,123
Who's this?

391
00:17:09,125 --> 00:17:11,426
This is Dwight Schrute.
Who is this?

392
00:17:11,428 --> 00:17:13,962
Gil.

393
00:17:13,964 --> 00:17:15,330
Are you going to tell Michael?

394
00:17:15,332 --> 00:17:16,798
How 'bout this?

395
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:19,234
I don't tell Michael,
and in exchange,

396
00:17:19,236 --> 00:17:22,370
you owe me one great, big,
giant favor

397
00:17:22,372 --> 00:17:27,275
redeemable by me at a time
and place of my choosing.

398
00:17:27,277 --> 00:17:31,179
Guess what I found out
about Oscar tonight?

399
00:17:31,181 --> 00:17:34,148
He was lying about being sick.

400
00:17:34,150 --> 00:17:36,784
Should I have reported
Oscar's malfeasance?

401
00:17:36,786 --> 00:17:38,553
Hmm, probably.

402
00:17:38,555 --> 00:17:41,456
But know I know something
he doesn't want me to know.

403
00:17:41,458 --> 00:17:43,658
So I can use his malfeasance

404
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:45,460
to establish leverage.

405
00:17:45,462 --> 00:17:47,795
Otherwise, it's just malfeasance

406
00:17:47,797 --> 00:17:51,332
For malfeasance's-s sake.

407
00:17:53,602 --> 00:17:54,636
Hey.

408
00:17:54,638 --> 00:17:57,472
I know.
I know, I know.

409
00:17:58,040 --> 00:17:59,574
Um...

410
00:18:00,509 --> 00:18:01,643
What happened?

411
00:18:01,645 --> 00:18:03,111
I... oh.

412
00:18:03,113 --> 00:18:05,580
Just, um, you know,

413
00:18:05,582 --> 00:18:07,749
I was trying...
just the expense reports.

414
00:18:07,751 --> 00:18:10,585
And then... God, Toby, you know?
He just...

415
00:18:10,587 --> 00:18:12,754
I know.
I just...

416
00:18:12,756 --> 00:18:14,822
I just hope that...

417
00:18:14,824 --> 00:18:19,027
Oh, I just hope that this
doesn't affect our friendship!

418
00:18:20,996 --> 00:18:24,198
It's stupid.
It's so stupid.

419
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:25,600
Hey, hey, whoa, whoa.

420
00:18:25,602 --> 00:18:28,369
Listen, man, it's...

421
00:18:28,371 --> 00:18:31,239
You know, it's not a big deal.
It's gonna be fine.

422
00:18:31,241 --> 00:18:33,041
No, I know.
I'm good, I'm good.

423
00:18:33,043 --> 00:18:34,108
It's just...

424
00:18:36,245 --> 00:18:38,212
Look, it's one day.
Everything's gonna be all right.

425
00:18:38,214 --> 00:18:39,747
- Yeah, okay.
- You good?

426
00:18:39,749 --> 00:18:42,850
Yeah, I'm good.
Okay.

427
00:18:42,852 --> 00:18:46,354
Creed, did you organize
the menu book?

428
00:18:46,356 --> 00:18:48,723
Oh, I thought that was
more on a volunteer basis.

429
00:18:48,725 --> 00:18:51,893
No. That was mandatory.

430
00:18:51,895 --> 00:18:54,629
Oh, I thought it was
a volunteer thing.

431
00:18:59,368 --> 00:19:03,037
Hey, here's your schedule
for next week.

432
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:04,605
Are you okay?

433
00:19:04,607 --> 00:19:06,541
Yeah, I'm fine. Look.

434
00:19:06,543 --> 00:19:08,276
About you and Jim...

435
00:19:08,278 --> 00:19:09,677
Oh, no, that's...
You don't have to...

436
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:12,146
No, I just feel it's my
responsibility

437
00:19:12,148 --> 00:19:13,881
as your boss-slash-friend...

438
00:19:13,883 --> 00:19:15,516
No, it's really... it's okay.

439
00:19:15,518 --> 00:19:17,518
Um, I know that Jim had, like,
a crush on me

440
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:18,853
when he first started.

441
00:19:18,855 --> 00:19:21,055
But that was a long time ago,
so...

442
00:19:21,057 --> 00:19:24,525
It wasn't that long ago.
It was on the booze cruise.

443
00:19:25,694 --> 00:19:27,996
Jim had a crush on me
on the booze cruise,

444
00:19:27,998 --> 00:19:29,897
or he told you about it
on the booze cruise.

445
00:19:29,899 --> 00:19:33,334
Um... okay.

446
00:19:33,336 --> 00:19:36,371
Shut it, Michael.
I'm done.

447
00:19:36,373 --> 00:19:39,207
That's it, I'm out.

448
00:19:42,878 --> 00:19:45,113
- Ready?
- Yup.

449
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:53,021
People are always coming to me.

450
00:19:53,023 --> 00:19:57,158
"Michael, I have a secret.
You're the only one I trust."

451
00:19:57,160 --> 00:20:00,495
No, thanks,
because keeping a secret

452
00:20:00,497 --> 00:20:03,464
can only lead to trouble.

453
00:20:03,466 --> 00:20:06,601
Like, I was watching Cinemax
last weekend, this movie.

454
00:20:07,903 --> 00:20:11,572
Portrait of a Prostitute.

455
00:20:11,574 --> 00:20:15,743
Something... Secrets of a...
More Secrets of a Call Girl.

456
00:20:15,745 --> 00:20:17,945
And the lead character, Shila,

457
00:20:17,947 --> 00:20:19,380
is framed for murder.

458
00:20:19,382 --> 00:20:24,185
Goes on the run, and winds up
working at a bordello in Malibu.

459
00:20:25,621 --> 00:20:28,623
I don't... I don't wanna
live like that.

460
00:20:28,625 --> 00:20:29,690
I like it here.

461
00:20:29,692 --> 00:20:33,594
I don't wanna be Shila.
I like being Michael Scott.
