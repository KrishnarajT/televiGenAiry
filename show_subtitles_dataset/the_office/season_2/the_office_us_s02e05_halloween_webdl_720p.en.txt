1
00:00:08,201 --> 00:00:09,868
Happy Halloween, everyone.

2
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:11,971
Oh, that's great.
Hey.

3
00:00:11,973 --> 00:00:13,839
Happy Halloween.

4
00:00:13,841 --> 00:00:15,607
Jan called.

5
00:00:16,977 --> 00:00:18,911
O... kay.

6
00:00:19,813 --> 00:00:22,948
I know why she's calling.

7
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:24,183
It's the end of the month,

8
00:00:24,185 --> 00:00:25,918
and I was supposed
to let somebody go

9
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,686
by the end of the month.

10
00:00:28,689 --> 00:00:31,523
And somehow I'm supposed
to put on a costume and smile.

11
00:00:34,461 --> 00:00:35,561
Okay.

12
00:00:35,563 --> 00:00:36,962
Jan Levinson's office.

13
00:00:36,964 --> 00:00:39,131
Hey, Sherri,
Michael Scott returning.

14
00:00:39,133 --> 00:00:40,566
Oh, she's in a meeting.

15
00:00:40,568 --> 00:00:43,435
She just wanted the name
of the employee you let go.

16
00:00:43,437 --> 00:00:45,237
Well, I'm gonna wait 'til
the end of the day.

17
00:00:45,239 --> 00:00:47,706
Because the book said it's best
to wait 'til the end of the day.

18
00:00:47,708 --> 00:00:50,175
I just need the name of who
you're planning to let go.

19
00:00:50,177 --> 00:00:53,345
I.. don't... know... yet.

20
00:00:53,347 --> 00:00:55,080
I will have to call her back.

21
00:00:56,116 --> 00:00:58,183
I know she wanted the name.

22
00:00:58,185 --> 00:00:59,618
Okay, Sherri?

23
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:01,120
Yeah?

24
00:01:01,122 --> 00:01:04,957
If you were getting fired,
how would you wanna be told

25
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:06,458
so that you could
still be friends

26
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:08,160
with the person firing you?

27
00:01:09,796 --> 00:01:12,131
Jan wants the name as soon
as possible, Michael.

28
00:01:12,133 --> 00:01:14,066
Thanks.
Mmm-hmm.

29
00:01:14,068 --> 00:01:15,000
I'll call her back.

30
00:01:16,469 --> 00:01:19,438
Wish I could fire Sherri.

31
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:21,240
Hey, I'm still here.
Okay.

32
00:01:21,242 --> 00:01:22,741
I'm sorry.
Yeah.

33
00:01:22,743 --> 00:01:23,942
No?
Okay.

34
00:01:23,944 --> 00:01:26,245
Bye.
Hanging up now.

35
00:02:02,282 --> 00:02:05,751
I mean, you hear
about layoffs in the news,

36
00:02:05,753 --> 00:02:07,586
but when you actually have
to do it yourself,

37
00:02:07,588 --> 00:02:09,388
it is heavy stuff.

38
00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:10,956
It's...

39
00:02:10,958 --> 00:02:14,126
I mean, these are people's lives
you're talking about.

40
00:02:14,128 --> 00:02:15,994
You wanted me?
Yes.

41
00:02:23,303 --> 00:02:25,404
Papier-mâché?
Yes.

42
00:02:25,406 --> 00:02:27,439
Yesh.
Hmm.

43
00:02:27,441 --> 00:02:32,311
Um, Pam I have
to let somebody go today.

44
00:02:32,313 --> 00:02:35,314
This is the hardest thing
I've ever had to do.

45
00:02:35,316 --> 00:02:37,516
Why did you put it off
until Halloween?

46
00:02:37,518 --> 00:02:39,985
Because it's very scary stuff.

47
00:02:39,987 --> 00:02:42,254
Well, I think it's gonna put
a damper on the party a little.

48
00:02:42,256 --> 00:02:43,789
You're worried about the party?

49
00:02:43,791 --> 00:02:45,124
There's a man's
life at stake here.

50
00:02:45,126 --> 00:02:46,892
So it's a man?
No.

51
00:02:47,627 --> 00:02:50,095
Or a woman.
A human life.

52
00:02:50,097 --> 00:02:52,197
If you had to guess,

53
00:02:52,199 --> 00:02:55,934
who would it be,
based on their job performance?

54
00:02:55,936 --> 00:02:57,903
And who do you think
deserves to be fired?

55
00:02:57,905 --> 00:02:58,904
Who would that be?

56
00:03:00,106 --> 00:03:01,673
I just answer the phone.

57
00:03:02,609 --> 00:03:05,777
And sometimes you just let
it go to voice mail.

58
00:03:12,218 --> 00:03:14,887
Your costume is fantastic.

59
00:03:16,022 --> 00:03:17,789
I know.

60
00:03:17,791 --> 00:03:20,692
I sent away for it
in July from a catalog.

61
00:03:22,062 --> 00:03:24,229
Oh, no.
Don't, don't, don't, don't.

62
00:03:24,231 --> 00:03:25,531
Aah.

63
00:03:26,567 --> 00:03:27,666
Okay.

64
00:03:27,668 --> 00:03:32,104
Oh, man.
Okay, I have to fire somebody.

65
00:03:36,242 --> 00:03:38,443
What is that?
What are you supposed to be?

66
00:03:40,046 --> 00:03:42,281
I'm a three-hole punch
version of Jim.

67
00:03:42,283 --> 00:03:43,749
'Cause he can have me
either way.

68
00:03:43,751 --> 00:03:46,185
Plain white Jim,
or three-hole punch.

69
00:03:46,187 --> 00:03:48,987
- That's great.
- Oh, yeah.

70
00:03:48,989 --> 00:03:51,890
Yeah, well, look.
What about me?

71
00:03:54,261 --> 00:03:57,563
What are you?
A monk?

72
00:03:57,565 --> 00:03:59,898
I am a Sith Lord.

73
00:04:02,135 --> 00:04:03,735
Oh, big deal.

74
00:04:03,737 --> 00:04:06,705
Three round pieces of paper
taped to his shirt.

75
00:04:06,707 --> 00:04:09,608
This cost me $129.

76
00:04:10,376 --> 00:04:11,443
Ass.

77
00:04:16,216 --> 00:04:18,350
Hey, you guys excited
about the party?

78
00:04:18,352 --> 00:04:21,853
It's gonna be fun.
Yeah.

79
00:04:21,855 --> 00:04:25,023
Oh, look at you.
Showing your colors.

80
00:04:25,025 --> 00:04:27,159
Bet you wish you wore
a dress every day.

81
00:04:27,161 --> 00:04:28,460
What are you implying?

82
00:04:28,462 --> 00:04:30,562
All good.
Happy Halloween.

83
00:04:30,564 --> 00:04:33,298
What happened to all those
spooky decorations that we had?

84
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:35,968
The cobwebs and such?

85
00:04:35,970 --> 00:04:38,337
I don't know.
We put them all up last night.

86
00:04:41,775 --> 00:04:43,976
Well, you know what?
Go buy some more.

87
00:04:43,978 --> 00:04:45,377
I'll approve the overages.

88
00:04:45,379 --> 00:04:47,012
Sound good?
Yeah.

89
00:04:47,014 --> 00:04:48,780
Good.

90
00:04:48,782 --> 00:04:52,017
Oh, yeah, also,
about budget stuff,

91
00:04:52,019 --> 00:04:55,153
um, I need you to find,
like a...

92
00:04:55,155 --> 00:04:58,056
a full employee salary
plus benefits, like 50 grand.

93
00:04:59,259 --> 00:05:01,593
I'm gonna need you to find
50 grand in the numbers.

94
00:05:01,595 --> 00:05:03,462
But we don't keep two cents...

95
00:05:03,464 --> 00:05:04,963
Well, that's not
what I'm saying.

96
00:05:04,965 --> 00:05:06,231
Just, you know, find it.

97
00:05:06,233 --> 00:05:09,067
Pretend that your
jobs depend on it.

98
00:05:14,841 --> 00:05:16,742
Mmm-hm-hmm.

99
00:05:16,744 --> 00:05:19,378
Interesting take on Dorothy.
I love it.

100
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:20,979
Hey, you know what would
even be better?

101
00:05:20,981 --> 00:05:22,848
Soccer ball and cleats.

102
00:05:22,850 --> 00:05:24,349
Why is that?

103
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:25,617
Bend It Like Beckham.

104
00:05:25,619 --> 00:05:27,686
Oh, like, the movie
about the Indian girl

105
00:05:27,688 --> 00:05:29,421
who plays soccer?

106
00:05:29,423 --> 00:05:30,789
Yeah.

107
00:05:30,791 --> 00:05:32,491
That would be perfect.

108
00:05:32,493 --> 00:05:35,260
Yeah, I mean, I guess
I could do that.

109
00:05:35,262 --> 00:05:37,796
I don't really play soccer
or anything.

110
00:05:37,798 --> 00:05:40,632
Well, I don't really
have two heads, so.

111
00:05:40,634 --> 00:05:43,368
Wait, what are you again?
Oh, right.

112
00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:44,870
Three-hole punch!

113
00:05:48,208 --> 00:05:50,642
Okay, greatest strength.

114
00:05:50,644 --> 00:05:52,711
Okay, okay.

115
00:05:52,713 --> 00:05:54,813
A doglike obedience
to authority.

116
00:05:54,815 --> 00:05:55,614
Nice.

117
00:05:55,616 --> 00:05:58,884
That doesn't sound good.
Okay, okay.

118
00:05:58,886 --> 00:06:02,688
Um, how 'bout
the ultimate team player?

119
00:06:02,690 --> 00:06:04,890
Dwight is special,

120
00:06:04,892 --> 00:06:07,826
but I don't believe that his
talents are being used

121
00:06:07,828 --> 00:06:09,227
in this office.

122
00:06:09,229 --> 00:06:11,463
So Pam and I have put his résumé

123
00:06:11,465 --> 00:06:14,966
on monster.com, Google,
craigslist.

124
00:06:14,968 --> 00:06:17,636
We're really interested
most in jobs

125
00:06:17,638 --> 00:06:19,404
that take Dwight out of state.

126
00:06:19,406 --> 00:06:22,307
Um, preferably Alaska.
Or India.

127
00:06:22,309 --> 00:06:24,843
He's a gun nut.
Mmm.

128
00:06:24,845 --> 00:06:27,646
Sticks to his guns.

129
00:06:28,448 --> 00:06:30,682
Well, I looked through
all the budgets.

130
00:06:30,684 --> 00:06:32,451
And there is one department...
Yes?

131
00:06:32,453 --> 00:06:34,052
That has three people...
Yeah?

132
00:06:34,054 --> 00:06:36,254
Doing the work that could
be done by two.

133
00:06:36,256 --> 00:06:37,356
This is great.

134
00:06:40,626 --> 00:06:41,760
Oh.

135
00:06:42,428 --> 00:06:46,131
Yeah. Oh.

136
00:06:46,133 --> 00:06:48,266
Who do you think it should be?
Jim, definitely.

137
00:06:48,268 --> 00:06:49,568
No, Jim brings in money.

138
00:06:49,570 --> 00:06:51,403
Phyllis.
Eh.

139
00:06:51,405 --> 00:06:55,173
Stanley. Pam.
Oscar. Meredith.

140
00:06:55,175 --> 00:06:57,809
Kevin. Angela.

141
00:06:57,811 --> 00:06:59,611
It's not a popularity contest.

142
00:06:59,613 --> 00:07:02,581
Although it does make sense
to fire the least popular,

143
00:07:02,583 --> 00:07:06,518
because it has the least
effect on morale.

144
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:08,420
One of the warehouse guys.

145
00:07:09,789 --> 00:07:11,123
What?

146
00:07:11,125 --> 00:07:13,558
There was someone
left off that list?

147
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:15,560
Who?
Who is he saying?

148
00:07:17,131 --> 00:07:19,731
You're right.
I didn't even think of him.

149
00:07:19,733 --> 00:07:21,800
No, Michael.

150
00:07:21,802 --> 00:07:23,635
Yeah, that's actually
a really good idea.

151
00:07:23,637 --> 00:07:26,605
No, not me.
Yeah, I could.

152
00:07:26,607 --> 00:07:28,106
Not Dwight.

153
00:07:28,108 --> 00:07:29,574
I'm not saying
that's what he said.

154
00:07:29,576 --> 00:07:31,510
I know that's what he said.

155
00:07:31,512 --> 00:07:32,611
What?

156
00:07:33,312 --> 00:07:35,247
Tell him not Dwight.

157
00:07:35,249 --> 00:07:37,549
That is not a very nice
thing to say about him.

158
00:07:37,551 --> 00:07:39,284
Tell him to stop.
Are you kidding?

159
00:07:39,286 --> 00:07:40,485
Quiet you.

160
00:07:40,487 --> 00:07:42,254
I agree.
He'd land on his feet.

161
00:07:42,256 --> 00:07:43,989
Make him be quiet.

162
00:07:47,226 --> 00:07:49,127
Those aren't chips and dip.

163
00:07:49,129 --> 00:07:51,396
No, I made brownies.

164
00:07:52,833 --> 00:07:54,499
What?

165
00:07:54,501 --> 00:07:57,235
I'm just trying to figure out
why you're sabotaging things.

166
00:07:58,604 --> 00:07:59,571
I made brownies.

167
00:07:59,573 --> 00:08:03,041
And I made cookies.
Same category.

168
00:08:05,445 --> 00:08:08,480
I'm guessing Angela's the one
in the neighborhood

169
00:08:08,482 --> 00:08:13,718
who gives the trick-or-treaters
some toothbrushes.

170
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:16,054
Pennies.

171
00:08:16,923 --> 00:08:17,956
Walnuts.

172
00:08:17,958 --> 00:08:20,792
Dunder-Mifflin,
this is Pam.

173
00:08:21,527 --> 00:08:22,828
Uh, yeah.

174
00:08:23,463 --> 00:08:25,096
Just one second.

175
00:08:25,098 --> 00:08:28,500
I will transfer you
to our manager, Michael Scott.

176
00:08:34,508 --> 00:08:36,641
Michael Scott here.

177
00:08:36,643 --> 00:08:41,213
Yes, I am regional manager
of this orifice.

178
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:43,248
Mmm-hmm.

179
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:46,384
Dwight Schrute is amazing.

180
00:08:46,386 --> 00:08:48,019
Yeah.

181
00:08:48,021 --> 00:08:50,956
No, he is actually the single
greatest employee

182
00:08:50,958 --> 00:08:52,958
of his generation.

183
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:54,493
Mmm-hmm.

184
00:08:54,495 --> 00:08:56,061
You know what?
I'm gonna tell you what.

185
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:58,563
You hire Dwight K. Schrute,

186
00:08:58,565 --> 00:09:00,765
and he does not meet, nay,

187
00:09:00,767 --> 00:09:05,103
exceed every one
of your wildest expectations,

188
00:09:05,105 --> 00:09:07,239
well, then you can hold me,

189
00:09:07,241 --> 00:09:09,908
Michael Gary Scott,

190
00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:12,611
personally and financially
responsible.

191
00:09:12,613 --> 00:09:14,613
Okay. Okay.

192
00:09:14,615 --> 00:09:16,681
Okay-kay-kay-kay.

193
00:09:16,683 --> 00:09:18,016
Okay.

194
00:09:23,356 --> 00:09:25,724
Stanley, could you come
with me, please.

195
00:09:25,726 --> 00:09:27,225
No.

196
00:09:30,396 --> 00:09:32,264
As assistant regional manager...

197
00:09:32,266 --> 00:09:34,165
To the...
Look.

198
00:09:34,167 --> 00:09:36,268
I've got some bad news.

199
00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:37,402
You're fired.

200
00:09:37,404 --> 00:09:39,271
You need to pack up
your things and go.

201
00:09:39,273 --> 00:09:41,806
I'm serious, Stanley.

202
00:09:41,808 --> 00:09:44,075
It's over, I'm sorry.

203
00:09:44,077 --> 00:09:45,944
You're fired.

204
00:09:45,946 --> 00:09:47,812
Get your fingers off my phone.

205
00:09:53,953 --> 00:09:55,987
So, how did it go with Stanley?

206
00:09:55,989 --> 00:09:57,556
How... how'd he take it?

207
00:09:57,558 --> 00:09:59,524
He wouldn't listen to me.
Oh, come on.

208
00:09:59,526 --> 00:10:01,826
If you wanna fire him, you're
gonna have to tell him yourself.

209
00:10:01,828 --> 00:10:03,995
I don't wanna fire Stanley.
I never said that.

210
00:10:03,997 --> 00:10:06,932
I'm certainly not going
to do it myself.

211
00:10:08,701 --> 00:10:10,368
Get those big, baleful
eyes staring at me.

212
00:10:10,370 --> 00:10:11,903
Yikes.

213
00:10:11,905 --> 00:10:13,438
Okay, just...

214
00:10:14,774 --> 00:10:17,375
Cumberland Mills?

215
00:10:17,377 --> 00:10:20,178
And how did you get my résumé?

216
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:22,113
Oh, no, no.
I'm very flattered.

217
00:10:22,115 --> 00:10:23,582
Don't get me wrong.

218
00:10:23,584 --> 00:10:26,284
I'm just not sure
that it's my official résumé,

219
00:10:26,286 --> 00:10:29,321
or if it's something that maybe

220
00:10:29,323 --> 00:10:32,891
a satisfied customer
posted online.

221
00:10:32,893 --> 00:10:36,394
What does it say under
martial arts training?

222
00:10:37,697 --> 00:10:39,831
Oh, okay, I'm gonna have
to supplement that.

223
00:10:39,833 --> 00:10:42,400
Could I have your fax number?

224
00:10:42,402 --> 00:10:44,369
Would I ever leave this company?

225
00:10:44,371 --> 00:10:46,171
Look, I'm all about loyalty.

226
00:10:46,173 --> 00:10:47,639
In fact, I feel like

227
00:10:47,641 --> 00:10:51,142
part of what I'm getting
paid for here is my loyalty.

228
00:10:51,144 --> 00:10:52,611
But if there were somewhere else

229
00:10:52,613 --> 00:10:55,180
that valued that loyalty
more highly,

230
00:10:55,182 --> 00:10:59,618
I'm going wherever
they value loyalty the most.

231
00:11:02,188 --> 00:11:04,222
Oh, hey.

232
00:11:04,224 --> 00:11:06,891
Oh, your dress is stuck
in the back.

233
00:11:06,893 --> 00:11:09,761
Oh.

234
00:11:12,531 --> 00:11:14,366
So you got the fax?

235
00:11:14,368 --> 00:11:16,735
So why didn't you add it
to the res...

236
00:11:16,737 --> 00:11:18,003
What do you mean?

237
00:11:18,005 --> 00:11:19,471
Of course martial arts training
is relevant.

238
00:11:19,473 --> 00:11:21,139
Oh, excuse me.

239
00:11:21,141 --> 00:11:23,875
I know about a billion Asians
that would beg to differ.

240
00:11:23,877 --> 00:11:26,745
Uh, yeah, I get
a little frustrated

241
00:11:26,747 --> 00:11:28,380
when I'm dealing
with incompetence.

242
00:11:28,382 --> 00:11:30,115
Well, you know what?
You can go to hell too.

243
00:11:30,117 --> 00:11:32,584
And I will see you there...
burning.

244
00:11:32,586 --> 00:11:34,352
Fine. Okay, wait.

245
00:11:34,354 --> 00:11:36,888
So you'll let me know
when you've made a decis...

246
00:11:41,227 --> 00:11:43,628
Jim is really talented.

247
00:11:43,630 --> 00:11:47,399
And he should be the one who's
getting a better job offer.

248
00:11:47,401 --> 00:11:48,433
Like, for real.

249
00:11:48,435 --> 00:11:50,001
Don't take this the wrong way,

250
00:11:50,003 --> 00:11:53,438
but you should go for that job.

251
00:11:56,575 --> 00:12:00,278
Um, it's in Maryland.

252
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:01,980
Yeah.

253
00:12:01,982 --> 00:12:03,581
But, I mean, look at the salary.

254
00:12:03,583 --> 00:12:06,017
And it's definitely a step up.

255
00:12:06,019 --> 00:12:08,486
And a challenge.

256
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:11,823
Yeah.

257
00:12:15,127 --> 00:12:17,729
Yeah, you know what?
Maybe...

258
00:12:18,597 --> 00:12:20,532
Maybe I will.

259
00:12:23,335 --> 00:12:24,703
Jim...

260
00:12:26,138 --> 00:12:30,375
This is called leveraging
an offer.

261
00:12:30,377 --> 00:12:33,812
Michael, can I talk to you
for a moment? Oh, God.

262
00:12:33,814 --> 00:12:35,613
I just thought you should know

263
00:12:35,615 --> 00:12:39,417
that I was just offered
a job with better pay,

264
00:12:39,419 --> 00:12:43,121
better benefits and a better
title at Cumberland Mills.

265
00:12:43,123 --> 00:12:44,456
Fantastic.

266
00:12:44,458 --> 00:12:45,690
And I turned it down.

267
00:12:45,692 --> 00:12:48,259
What? That would've
solved all my problems.

268
00:12:48,261 --> 00:12:50,729
Out of loyalty
to this company...

269
00:12:50,731 --> 00:12:52,330
Oh, you idiot.

270
00:12:52,332 --> 00:12:55,033
So I was hoping to be made
assistant regional manager.

271
00:12:55,035 --> 00:12:57,869
If you left,
I wouldn't have to fire anybody.

272
00:12:57,871 --> 00:12:59,337
But then you wouldn't
have me here.

273
00:12:59,339 --> 00:13:02,073
Big deal, oh, it would've
worked out so well.

274
00:13:02,075 --> 00:13:03,374
Can you get it back?

275
00:13:03,376 --> 00:13:04,442
It's in Maryland.

276
00:13:04,444 --> 00:13:05,877
You can call.
Can you call 'em?

277
00:13:05,879 --> 00:13:08,780
I can't... I... I suppose I... no.

278
00:13:08,782 --> 00:13:10,548
They never really made me
an offer anyway.

279
00:13:10,550 --> 00:13:14,085
Why are you torturing me?

280
00:13:14,087 --> 00:13:15,220
God.

281
00:13:16,655 --> 00:13:20,158
Honestly, I don't think that
Michael has the slightest clue

282
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:21,893
of who he's going to fire.

283
00:13:21,895 --> 00:13:24,062
I think he keeps hoping that
someone's going to volunteer.

284
00:13:24,064 --> 00:13:27,799
Uh, or be run over
by a bus before the deadline.

285
00:13:27,801 --> 00:13:29,634
But in the end,
really what's going to happen is

286
00:13:29,636 --> 00:13:31,369
it's gonna be the first
person to give him

287
00:13:31,371 --> 00:13:32,604
a dirty look in the hall.

288
00:13:34,107 --> 00:13:37,108
And therein lies the true
essence of his charisma.

289
00:13:38,445 --> 00:13:40,879
Can I speak to you a minute?

290
00:13:40,881 --> 00:13:42,814
Um... yes.

291
00:14:07,206 --> 00:14:08,706
Michael, I really
didn't mean to...

292
00:14:08,708 --> 00:14:10,775
Help me.

293
00:14:10,777 --> 00:14:12,143
I'm sorry?

294
00:14:12,145 --> 00:14:14,312
I want you to role
play firing me.

295
00:14:14,314 --> 00:14:17,248
I want you to fire me,
and I will take it.

296
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:18,817
Oh, you want me to be you? Yes.

297
00:14:18,819 --> 00:14:20,985
I want you to be me,
and I will be Creed.

298
00:14:20,987 --> 00:14:22,687
Oh, are you firing Creed?
No, no.

299
00:14:22,689 --> 00:14:26,624
No, that's just first... thing.
Can't... in head.

300
00:14:26,626 --> 00:14:28,860
We should switch seats
in order to...

301
00:14:28,862 --> 00:14:30,995
Yes, that's a good idea.

302
00:14:32,431 --> 00:14:33,731
Excuse me.

303
00:14:38,771 --> 00:14:40,972
I'm really sorry,
but I have to let you go.

304
00:14:40,974 --> 00:14:43,174
And it's purely budgetary.

305
00:14:43,176 --> 00:14:44,843
It's not personal...

306
00:14:44,845 --> 00:14:47,645
I'm gonna kill myself!

307
00:14:47,647 --> 00:14:48,780
Wow.

308
00:14:48,782 --> 00:14:50,448
I'm going to kill myself!

309
00:14:50,450 --> 00:14:51,816
And it's your fault!

310
00:14:51,818 --> 00:14:53,318
That's an overreaction.

311
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:56,087
Corporate is really
breathing down my neck.

312
00:14:56,089 --> 00:14:58,089
And they're saying
this has to be done

313
00:14:58,091 --> 00:14:59,557
by the end of the month.

314
00:14:59,559 --> 00:15:01,726
Is this you? Are you being you,
or is this Creed?

315
00:15:01,728 --> 00:15:05,830
I... this is Creed.

316
00:15:05,832 --> 00:15:08,166
Okay. I'm improvising,
so just try to keep up.

317
00:15:08,168 --> 00:15:09,734
And I'm very angry.

318
00:15:09,736 --> 00:15:11,336
Hold that thought.
Creed?

319
00:15:11,338 --> 00:15:13,504
Michael Scott here. I'm gonna
kill you for firing me.

320
00:15:13,506 --> 00:15:14,973
Toby? Mmm-hmm?

321
00:15:14,975 --> 00:15:17,175
I really have to take this,
Creed, so it was really worth...

322
00:15:17,177 --> 00:15:20,044
Get off, get off.
No, no.

323
00:15:25,484 --> 00:15:28,453
Just, just... yeah.

324
00:15:29,623 --> 00:15:31,623
What happened?

325
00:15:31,625 --> 00:15:33,358
It wasn't me.
Oh.

326
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:34,859
That was, like, crazy.

327
00:15:34,861 --> 00:15:36,127
I know.
'Cause I was...

328
00:15:45,537 --> 00:15:47,372
Uh, hey, Creed?

329
00:15:47,374 --> 00:15:48,539
Huh?

330
00:15:48,541 --> 00:15:50,241
Could I talk to you
for a second?

331
00:15:55,114 --> 00:15:57,615
You are great.

332
00:15:57,617 --> 00:15:59,450
Very ambitious.

333
00:16:00,085 --> 00:16:01,686
And I feel like you want more

334
00:16:01,688 --> 00:16:03,922
than this little office
has to offer.

335
00:16:03,924 --> 00:16:07,358
And I understand that you'd
wanna just spread your wings

336
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,260
and fly the coop.

337
00:16:09,262 --> 00:16:13,898
We're gonna have to...
You... you want something better.

338
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:16,901
No, I don't.
I wanna stay right here.

339
00:16:16,903 --> 00:16:18,436
No, you wanna leave.

340
00:16:18,438 --> 00:16:20,371
No, I wanna stay here.

341
00:16:20,373 --> 00:16:22,206
Why are you making this so hard?

342
00:16:22,208 --> 00:16:24,108
I think there's
a misunderstanding, Michael.

343
00:16:24,110 --> 00:16:25,376
I think you're right.

344
00:16:25,378 --> 00:16:28,279
Can I go?
No, of course, you can't go.

345
00:16:28,281 --> 00:16:32,350
We haven't even started
this horrible process of...

346
00:16:32,352 --> 00:16:34,519
Okay, Creed,

347
00:16:34,521 --> 00:16:39,257
I need to let somebody go today.

348
00:16:39,259 --> 00:16:42,226
They told me I need
to let somebody go.

349
00:16:42,228 --> 00:16:44,495
And as much as I think
you're a great guy,

350
00:16:44,497 --> 00:16:48,466
and I like you,
you're... you're, good-bye.

351
00:16:48,468 --> 00:16:50,068
Let's fight it.

352
00:16:50,070 --> 00:16:51,369
Hmm?

353
00:16:51,371 --> 00:16:52,870
Let's call Jan,
and fight this thing together

354
00:16:52,872 --> 00:16:54,072
like the old days.

355
00:16:54,074 --> 00:16:55,473
What old days?
What are you talking about?

356
00:16:55,475 --> 00:16:57,141
Did you start the paperwork yet?

357
00:16:57,143 --> 00:16:58,943
It's right here
on the desk, yeah.

358
00:16:58,945 --> 00:17:00,345
You don't have to do this,
Michael.

359
00:17:00,347 --> 00:17:02,380
I can't...
Undo it!

360
00:17:02,382 --> 00:17:03,881
I can't change anything.

361
00:17:03,883 --> 00:17:05,683
No, you have the power
to undo it.

362
00:17:05,685 --> 00:17:07,185
You undo it.

363
00:17:07,187 --> 00:17:09,454
Michael, undo it.

364
00:17:09,456 --> 00:17:10,955
Yeah, I went hunting once.

365
00:17:10,957 --> 00:17:12,924
Shot the deer in the leg.

366
00:17:12,926 --> 00:17:15,793
Had to kill it with a shovel.
Took about an hour.

367
00:17:15,795 --> 00:17:16,995
Why do you ask?

368
00:17:16,997 --> 00:17:19,030
I have to fire someone today.

369
00:17:19,032 --> 00:17:20,932
Okay?
Fine.

370
00:17:20,934 --> 00:17:24,769
Fire someone else.
Fire Devon, he's terrible.

371
00:17:24,771 --> 00:17:27,538
I am so much better
at my job than Devon.

372
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:29,507
Okay, well,
I already picked you.

373
00:17:29,509 --> 00:17:30,875
And you know that.

374
00:17:30,877 --> 00:17:33,144
So, unless I just
go through with this,

375
00:17:33,146 --> 00:17:36,114
you're always gonna look at me
as the guy who almost fired you.

376
00:17:36,116 --> 00:17:38,950
No, no, no, no, no.
I will forget so fast.

377
00:17:38,952 --> 00:17:40,284
You will be my savior.

378
00:17:40,286 --> 00:17:44,222
You're the guy who
gave me my life back.

379
00:17:44,224 --> 00:17:45,823
Thank you.

380
00:17:45,825 --> 00:17:47,825
I knew you'd see my way,
Michael, God bless you.

381
00:17:47,827 --> 00:17:49,660
You're a fine man.
Don't...

382
00:17:49,662 --> 00:17:51,329
Listen, you will not regret
this either.

383
00:17:51,331 --> 00:17:53,297
Devon's terrible.
No one's gonna miss him.

384
00:17:53,299 --> 00:17:56,968
Good, good, good.

385
00:18:13,052 --> 00:18:16,487
Devon, could I talk
to you for a sec?

386
00:18:16,489 --> 00:18:18,990
Creed's an idiot. You know that.
Well, he...

387
00:18:18,992 --> 00:18:21,626
No, no, no, no, no.
You had it right the first time.

388
00:18:21,628 --> 00:18:23,728
Well, maybe I did.
Exactly.

389
00:18:23,730 --> 00:18:25,863
You gotta go with you gut, man.

390
00:18:25,865 --> 00:18:27,698
Huh. Well...

391
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:30,301
No, I can't...
No.

392
00:18:30,303 --> 00:18:32,236
I can't go back.
I would look like an idiot.

393
00:18:32,238 --> 00:18:34,105
That's why I'm being fired?
No.

394
00:18:34,107 --> 00:18:35,940
So you might not look
like an idiot? No.

395
00:18:35,942 --> 00:18:37,809
It was all
the stuff that I said.

396
00:18:37,811 --> 00:18:40,445
It was the business downturn,
the cutbacks, and, and...

397
00:18:40,447 --> 00:18:42,213
This is unbelievable!

398
00:18:42,215 --> 00:18:45,683
I just hope that you
and I can remain friends.

399
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:50,354
Devon, wait... please.

400
00:18:50,356 --> 00:18:52,824
Look, look.

401
00:18:53,892 --> 00:18:56,527
In addition to severance,
and everything,

402
00:18:56,529 --> 00:18:58,863
I want to give you

403
00:19:00,966 --> 00:19:03,000
this gift certificate
to Chili's.

404
00:19:03,002 --> 00:19:04,469
From me.

405
00:19:05,671 --> 00:19:07,705
Okay? No hard feelings.

406
00:19:10,609 --> 00:19:13,711
Kevin, Jim, Pam, Kelly,

407
00:19:13,713 --> 00:19:16,147
Toby, Oscar, Meredith,

408
00:19:16,149 --> 00:19:18,449
Phyllis, Stanley, or the temp.

409
00:19:18,451 --> 00:19:20,451
If any of you wanna meet me
for a drink,

410
00:19:20,453 --> 00:19:21,986
I'm gonna be at Poor Richard's.

411
00:19:21,988 --> 00:19:24,822
And the rest of you
can go to hell.

412
00:19:31,797 --> 00:19:33,764
What about the Halloween party?

413
00:19:37,503 --> 00:19:39,704
Oh, hey, Jim.
Wait, stop.

414
00:19:39,706 --> 00:19:42,607
Um, I'm sorry

415
00:19:42,609 --> 00:19:45,309
for pushing you
toward Cumberland.

416
00:19:46,812 --> 00:19:50,081
Seriously, if you left here,
I would blow my brains out.

417
00:19:52,184 --> 00:19:52,984
Come on.

418
00:19:54,086 --> 00:19:56,387
That's just a figure
of speech, you know?

419
00:19:56,389 --> 00:19:58,222
Blow your brains out?
Come on.

420
00:19:58,224 --> 00:20:00,525
All it really means
is that we're friends.

421
00:20:00,527 --> 00:20:02,727
I mean, who else
is she gonna talk to

422
00:20:02,729 --> 00:20:04,762
if I'm gone, right?

423
00:20:04,764 --> 00:20:07,298
I mean, if she left I wouldn't
blow my brains out.

424
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:10,168
Of course, I would take
that job in Maryland.

425
00:20:10,170 --> 00:20:12,036
Because it's double the pay,

426
00:20:12,038 --> 00:20:16,207
and soft shell crab just happens
to be my favorite food.

427
00:20:23,549 --> 00:20:24,916
I love Halloween.

428
00:20:24,918 --> 00:20:26,617
You, know it's just...
it's just fun.

429
00:20:26,619 --> 00:20:28,686
Every year, it's just fun.

430
00:20:28,688 --> 00:20:31,489
Last Halloween,
I came as Janet Jackson's boob.

431
00:20:32,959 --> 00:20:34,492
It was topical.

432
00:20:34,494 --> 00:20:36,260
People got a big kick out of it.

433
00:20:36,262 --> 00:20:40,064
The year before that,
I came as Monica Lewinsky.

434
00:20:40,066 --> 00:20:42,533
And I wore a stained dress.

435
00:20:42,535 --> 00:20:45,570
The year before that,
I also came as Monica Lewinsky.

436
00:20:45,572 --> 00:20:47,805
And before that,
I was O.J.

437
00:20:47,807 --> 00:20:49,707
It was pretty funny.

438
00:20:49,709 --> 00:20:51,609
Oh, I wish you were here
last year.

439
00:20:59,818 --> 00:21:02,153
Trick or treat!

440
00:21:02,155 --> 00:21:03,588
Hey!

441
00:21:03,590 --> 00:21:04,956
How you doin'? Wow!

442
00:21:04,958 --> 00:21:06,591
You guys look great.

443
00:21:06,593 --> 00:21:08,092
I'm a bumblebee.

444
00:21:08,094 --> 00:21:09,994
You look great.

445
00:21:09,996 --> 00:21:11,562
And you're a princess?

446
00:21:11,564 --> 00:21:13,231
A fairy princess.

447
00:21:13,233 --> 00:21:15,233
You're very...
I'm a lion.

448
00:21:15,235 --> 00:21:16,901
You're a lion.
Wow, I want to hear your...

449
00:21:16,903 --> 00:21:18,636
Oh, okay, that's all yours.
That's all yours.

450
00:21:18,638 --> 00:21:20,171
Grab it, grab it.
You know what?

451
00:21:20,173 --> 00:21:22,707
You guys are getting
all of these.
