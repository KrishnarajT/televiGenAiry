1
00:00:00,977 --> 00:00:02,311
Kevin Malone, you're next.

2
00:00:02,313 --> 00:00:04,947
Spit that out.

3
00:00:04,949 --> 00:00:07,383
Spit... okay, come on.
Let's go.

4
00:00:11,287 --> 00:00:13,255
You look cute today, Dwight.

5
00:00:14,157 --> 00:00:15,524
Thanks, girl.

6
00:00:18,461 --> 00:00:20,429
So, yesterday, Dwight found
half a joint

7
00:00:20,431 --> 00:00:21,864
in the parking lot.

8
00:00:21,866 --> 00:00:24,166
Which is unfortunate,
because, as it turns out,

9
00:00:24,168 --> 00:00:26,068
Dwight finding drugs
is more dangerous

10
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:27,936
than most people using drugs.

11
00:00:27,938 --> 00:00:30,072
Let's go over
some of the symptoms

12
00:00:30,074 --> 00:00:32,908
of marijuana use, shall we?

13
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:35,444
You tell me
who this sounds like.

14
00:00:35,446 --> 00:00:37,946
Slow moving.

15
00:00:37,948 --> 00:00:39,581
Inattentive.

16
00:00:39,583 --> 00:00:41,583
Dull.

17
00:00:41,585 --> 00:00:44,653
Constantly snacking.

18
00:00:44,655 --> 00:00:47,923
Shows a lack of motivation.

19
00:00:50,493 --> 00:00:51,560
Hey.

20
00:00:52,095 --> 00:00:54,830
I like the people
I work with generally.

21
00:00:54,832 --> 00:00:56,698
With four exceptions.

22
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:59,101
But someone committed a crime.

23
00:00:59,103 --> 00:01:00,736
And I did not become
a Lackawanna County

24
00:01:00,738 --> 00:01:04,173
Volunteer Sheriff's Deputy
to make friends.

25
00:01:04,175 --> 00:01:06,208
And by the way, I haven't.

26
00:01:38,875 --> 00:01:43,245
I enjoy the tangy zip
of Miracle Whip.

27
00:01:44,682 --> 00:01:46,682
Jim does the best impressions.

28
00:01:46,684 --> 00:01:48,250
Sometimes he'll look up at me
from his desk

29
00:01:48,252 --> 00:01:50,352
and he'll just be someone else.

30
00:01:50,354 --> 00:01:51,987
Like, he'll go, um...

31
00:01:58,361 --> 00:02:00,629
That was supposed to be Phyllis.

32
00:02:00,631 --> 00:02:02,030
I can't do it as good as he can.

33
00:02:02,032 --> 00:02:04,533
And the guys are saying,
"Chug chug chug."

34
00:02:04,535 --> 00:02:06,768
But I'm so small
and all I'd eaten that day

35
00:02:06,770 --> 00:02:08,170
was one of those
Auntie M pretzels

36
00:02:08,172 --> 00:02:09,538
from the food court.

37
00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:11,773
So I said, "Is it okay
if I sip it?"

38
00:02:11,775 --> 00:02:12,774
And they said no.

39
00:02:12,776 --> 00:02:13,976
But Ryan seemed cool either way.

40
00:02:13,978 --> 00:02:15,410
Stop!

41
00:02:15,412 --> 00:02:18,547
This is not Kelly Kapur
story hour.

42
00:02:18,549 --> 00:02:22,484
Illegal drugs were consumed
on company property, okay?

43
00:02:22,486 --> 00:02:24,820
Your ass is on the line, Mister!

44
00:02:24,822 --> 00:02:26,555
My ass is on the line.

45
00:02:26,557 --> 00:02:28,090
Now, I'm gonna ask you again.

46
00:02:28,092 --> 00:02:31,693
What time did you
go home last night?

47
00:02:31,695 --> 00:02:33,028
6:00.

48
00:02:40,436 --> 00:02:42,104
I didn't know that you were
at a party Saturday night.

49
00:02:42,106 --> 00:02:44,806
I go to a lot of parties.

50
00:02:44,808 --> 00:02:46,975
Okay, I'm gonna need
to search your car.

51
00:02:46,977 --> 00:02:48,310
Give me your keys.

52
00:02:48,312 --> 00:02:49,444
I am not giving you my keys.

53
00:02:49,446 --> 00:02:50,846
Don't make me
do this the hard way.

54
00:02:50,848 --> 00:02:51,980
What's the hard way?

55
00:02:51,982 --> 00:02:54,316
I go down to the police station

56
00:02:54,318 --> 00:02:55,617
on my lunch break.

57
00:02:55,619 --> 00:02:56,952
I tell a police officer...

58
00:02:56,954 --> 00:02:58,520
I know several.

59
00:02:58,522 --> 00:03:00,489
What I suspect
you may have in your car.

60
00:03:00,491 --> 00:03:01,757
He requests a hearing
from a judge

61
00:03:01,759 --> 00:03:03,091
and obtains a search warrant.

62
00:03:03,093 --> 00:03:04,293
Once he has said warrant,

63
00:03:04,295 --> 00:03:07,396
he will drive over here
and make you give him

64
00:03:07,398 --> 00:03:08,864
the keys to your car.

65
00:03:08,866 --> 00:03:10,866
And you will have to obey him.

66
00:03:10,868 --> 00:03:12,568
Yeah, let's do it that way.

67
00:03:12,570 --> 00:03:14,069
Ryan, is he bugging you?

68
00:03:14,071 --> 00:03:15,504
Dwight, dude,

69
00:03:15,506 --> 00:03:17,673
you gotta take
a chill pill, man.

70
00:03:17,675 --> 00:03:21,276
It was one joint
in the parking lot, you know?

71
00:03:21,278 --> 00:03:23,579
You're totally harshing
the office mellow.

72
00:03:23,581 --> 00:03:24,580
I can't stop this investigation.

73
00:03:24,582 --> 00:03:25,714
It is my job.

74
00:03:25,716 --> 00:03:27,249
Whoa, you are a volunteer.

75
00:03:27,251 --> 00:03:28,750
I volunteered for this job.

76
00:03:28,752 --> 00:03:29,952
And that's not the same.

77
00:03:29,954 --> 00:03:31,153
It is my duty...
Volunteer duty,

78
00:03:31,155 --> 00:03:32,721
to investigate the crime scene.

79
00:03:32,723 --> 00:03:34,356
I have six more
interviews to go.

80
00:03:34,358 --> 00:03:36,658
And then I will reveal
what I know.

81
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:38,260
Narc!

82
00:03:39,429 --> 00:03:41,163
If you are attempting
to compliment me,

83
00:03:41,165 --> 00:03:42,197
you have done a very good job.

84
00:03:42,199 --> 00:03:43,498
I wasn't attempting
to compliment you.

85
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:44,700
Well, you have.

86
00:03:44,702 --> 00:03:46,101
Because being a narc is one of
the hardest jobs

87
00:03:46,103 --> 00:03:47,269
that you can have.
Okay.

88
00:03:47,271 --> 00:03:48,470
And I am very proud
of being a narc.

89
00:03:48,472 --> 00:03:49,471
Why don't you just cool it?

90
00:03:49,473 --> 00:03:51,039
Cool it, Dwight, please?

91
00:03:51,041 --> 00:03:52,040
God.

92
00:03:52,042 --> 00:03:53,709
Dude, where's my office?

93
00:03:53,711 --> 00:03:55,677
I totally lost it!

94
00:03:55,679 --> 00:03:56,812
'Cause I was half-baked!

95
00:03:56,814 --> 00:04:00,315
Smoking doobies!
Doobie Brothers.

96
00:04:00,317 --> 00:04:03,285
I was smoking doobies
with my brothers.

97
00:04:03,287 --> 00:04:05,520
Peace out!
Seacrest.

98
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:09,057
Well, your office is behind you.

99
00:04:09,059 --> 00:04:10,125
Thanks.

100
00:04:10,127 --> 00:04:11,660
Mmmunchies.

101
00:04:11,662 --> 00:04:12,861
Who wants some munchies?

102
00:04:12,863 --> 00:04:15,530
I don't think Michael's
ever done drugs.

103
00:04:16,466 --> 00:04:19,201
I don't know if anyone's
ever offered him any.

104
00:04:19,203 --> 00:04:21,903
Oscar visited Mexico
when he was five

105
00:04:21,905 --> 00:04:24,273
to attend his
great grandmother's funeral.

106
00:04:24,275 --> 00:04:25,841
What does that mean
to a United States

107
00:04:25,843 --> 00:04:27,609
law enforcement officer?

108
00:04:28,811 --> 00:04:30,379
He's a potential drug mule.

109
00:04:30,381 --> 00:04:32,881
Have you ever taken any
illegal drugs?

110
00:04:32,883 --> 00:04:34,082
No, I have not.

111
00:04:34,084 --> 00:04:36,385
Do you think it's possible
that maybe

112
00:04:36,387 --> 00:04:38,420
you could have had
some drugs in your system

113
00:04:38,422 --> 00:04:40,789
without you knowing about it?

114
00:04:40,791 --> 00:04:42,791
What are you implying?

115
00:04:42,793 --> 00:04:44,926
Have you ever...

116
00:04:45,795 --> 00:04:48,897
pooped a balloon?

117
00:04:51,167 --> 00:04:54,303
Okay, I'm done with this.

118
00:05:00,943 --> 00:05:02,678
He sure left in a hurry.

119
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:04,046
I don't wanna blow this.

120
00:05:04,048 --> 00:05:05,881
This is what all
good law enforcement officers

121
00:05:05,883 --> 00:05:07,549
dream of.

122
00:05:07,551 --> 00:05:11,420
The chance to solve
an actual crime.

123
00:05:11,422 --> 00:05:13,722
Do you know what this is?

124
00:05:13,724 --> 00:05:15,424
Yes, it's marijuana.

125
00:05:15,426 --> 00:05:16,858
How do you know that?

126
00:05:17,493 --> 00:05:18,660
It's labeled.

127
00:05:20,296 --> 00:05:21,330
Dammit.

128
00:05:22,433 --> 00:05:27,269
That is Northern Lights
Cannabis Indica.

129
00:05:27,271 --> 00:05:29,871
No.

130
00:05:29,873 --> 00:05:31,473
It's marijuana.

131
00:05:31,475 --> 00:05:32,607
I'm just saying
that you can't be sure

132
00:05:32,609 --> 00:05:33,809
that it wasn't you.

133
00:05:33,811 --> 00:05:35,444
That's ridiculous.
Of course it wasn't me.

134
00:05:35,446 --> 00:05:38,213
Marijuana is a memory loss drug.

135
00:05:38,215 --> 00:05:39,414
So maybe you just
don't remember.

136
00:05:39,416 --> 00:05:40,549
I would remember.

137
00:05:40,551 --> 00:05:41,650
Well, how could you

138
00:05:41,652 --> 00:05:42,651
of it just erased your memory?

139
00:05:42,653 --> 00:05:43,752
That's not how it works.

140
00:05:43,754 --> 00:05:45,987
Now, how do you know
how it works?

141
00:05:45,989 --> 00:05:47,556
Knock it off, okay?
I am interviewing you.

142
00:05:47,558 --> 00:05:49,658
No, you said that
I'd be conducting the interview

143
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:50,926
when I walked in here.

144
00:05:50,928 --> 00:05:53,028
Now, exactly how much pot
did you smoke?

145
00:05:55,098 --> 00:05:57,899
So, Pam told me you do
a great Stanley impression.

146
00:05:57,901 --> 00:05:59,034
I'd love to hear it.

147
00:05:59,036 --> 00:06:00,736
Oh, um...

148
00:06:02,071 --> 00:06:04,339
Why do you keep CC'ing me
on things

149
00:06:04,341 --> 00:06:06,742
that have nothing to do with me?

150
00:06:06,744 --> 00:06:08,443
Why do you...

151
00:06:08,445 --> 00:06:09,578
Oh.

152
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:10,846
Is that supposed to be me?

153
00:06:10,848 --> 00:06:12,347
Oh, hey, Stanley.

154
00:06:12,349 --> 00:06:13,582
I was just doing an impression.

155
00:06:13,584 --> 00:06:16,151
I do not think that is funny.

156
00:06:17,687 --> 00:06:20,088
He does everyone in the office.

157
00:06:20,090 --> 00:06:21,156
Hmm.

158
00:06:26,095 --> 00:06:28,730
I do not think that is funny.

159
00:06:28,732 --> 00:06:29,931
Jinx.
Buy me a coke.

160
00:06:29,933 --> 00:06:31,700
No no no!
No talking.

161
00:06:35,405 --> 00:06:36,538
Jim is not allowed to talk

162
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:38,774
until after he buys me a coke.

163
00:06:38,776 --> 00:06:39,941
Those are the rules of jinx.

164
00:06:39,943 --> 00:06:41,977
And they are
unflinchingly rigid.

165
00:06:49,485 --> 00:06:50,752
Sold out!

166
00:06:50,754 --> 00:06:54,289
That has never happened
in the history of jinx!

167
00:06:55,458 --> 00:06:57,159
Sorry, that's not my problem.

168
00:07:05,735 --> 00:07:07,369
I know you're innocent.

169
00:07:07,371 --> 00:07:08,603
But I can't look like
I'm treating you

170
00:07:08,605 --> 00:07:10,439
any differently.

171
00:07:10,441 --> 00:07:11,640
I understand.

172
00:07:13,009 --> 00:07:15,210
Where were you yesterday
after work?

173
00:07:16,212 --> 00:07:18,246
Uh-oh.
Uh-oh.

174
00:07:18,248 --> 00:07:19,314
Who's he calling?

175
00:07:19,316 --> 00:07:20,649
Rattin' somebody out.

176
00:07:20,651 --> 00:07:22,717
Narc.
Narc!

177
00:07:22,719 --> 00:07:23,718
Kevin.

178
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,053
That is so good, Michael.

179
00:07:25,055 --> 00:07:26,054
Remember the narc bit?

180
00:07:27,791 --> 00:07:28,924
I will let them know.

181
00:07:28,926 --> 00:07:30,358
Uh-oh.
Who's in trouble?

182
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:31,793
Attention, everyone!

183
00:07:31,795 --> 00:07:33,728
Drug testers are coming
in a couple hours

184
00:07:33,730 --> 00:07:36,198
to test everyone's urine.

185
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:38,366
Wha...
What?

186
00:07:38,368 --> 00:07:39,668
What are you talking about?
Company policy.

187
00:07:39,670 --> 00:07:41,436
If drugs are found
on the premises,

188
00:07:41,438 --> 00:07:43,238
there is automatic drug testing

189
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:45,407
conducted within 24 hours.

190
00:07:45,409 --> 00:07:47,342
Is that true, Toby?

191
00:07:47,344 --> 00:07:49,277
Uh, when you sign
your job application

192
00:07:49,279 --> 00:07:51,680
you agree to comply
with random drug testing.

193
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:57,285
Two nights ago I went
to an Alicia Keys concert

194
00:07:57,287 --> 00:07:59,020
at Montage Mountain
Performing Arts Center.

195
00:07:59,022 --> 00:08:00,589
I scored these
great aisle seats.

196
00:08:00,591 --> 00:08:02,491
Anyway, after the opening act,

197
00:08:02,493 --> 00:08:04,359
this beautiful girl
sits down next to me.

198
00:08:04,361 --> 00:08:06,328
And I never get to meet girls
with lip rings.

199
00:08:06,330 --> 00:08:08,230
And she had one.

200
00:08:08,232 --> 00:08:09,931
I don't know exactly
how this happened,

201
00:08:09,933 --> 00:08:12,200
but one of her friends
started passing around

202
00:08:12,202 --> 00:08:13,468
some stuff.

203
00:08:13,470 --> 00:08:15,003
And they said that it
was clove cigarettes.

204
00:08:15,005 --> 00:08:17,105
And I'm sure that
it was clove cigarettes.

205
00:08:17,107 --> 00:08:19,274
Everybody in the aisle
was doing it.

206
00:08:19,276 --> 00:08:21,376
Okay, attention, everyone.

207
00:08:21,378 --> 00:08:23,345
The drug testing
has been cancelled.

208
00:08:23,347 --> 00:08:24,880
Instead, I will be going around

209
00:08:24,882 --> 00:08:27,816
to each of you and doing
a visual inspection.

210
00:08:27,818 --> 00:08:28,950
No, you can't do that.

211
00:08:28,952 --> 00:08:29,985
I can do that.

212
00:08:29,987 --> 00:08:30,986
It is my office.

213
00:08:30,988 --> 00:08:32,020
No, you cannot.

214
00:08:32,022 --> 00:08:33,755
It has to be official.

215
00:08:33,757 --> 00:08:35,924
And it has to be urine.

216
00:08:40,897 --> 00:08:42,063
Uh... all right.

217
00:08:49,405 --> 00:08:52,274
Kevin, what prescription drugs
are you taking

218
00:08:52,276 --> 00:08:53,308
besides Rogaine?

219
00:08:53,310 --> 00:08:55,744
I'm not taking Rogaine.

220
00:08:55,746 --> 00:08:57,412
Angela, what about you?

221
00:08:57,414 --> 00:08:59,681
I don't take
any prescription drugs.

222
00:08:59,683 --> 00:09:02,617
You're not... on anything?

223
00:09:05,655 --> 00:09:06,755
Good.

224
00:09:10,092 --> 00:09:11,960
So, the first time
we went out to dinner,

225
00:09:11,962 --> 00:09:13,662
it was like, whatever, fine.

226
00:09:13,664 --> 00:09:15,130
But I was so nervous.

227
00:09:15,132 --> 00:09:17,499
So this time,
I want it to be special.

228
00:09:17,501 --> 00:09:18,934
So I bought a new dress!

229
00:09:18,936 --> 00:09:20,368
One of those kinds
that's kind of low cut

230
00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:21,603
at the top to show some things

231
00:09:21,605 --> 00:09:23,004
but not everything.

232
00:09:23,006 --> 00:09:25,073
I mean, not everything, Jim.
I promise.

233
00:09:25,075 --> 00:09:26,942
Hey, you guys.
What's going on?

234
00:09:26,944 --> 00:09:29,678
Oh, we're just having
the best conversation.

235
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,446
Oh, okay... well,
Michael wants to see everyone

236
00:09:31,448 --> 00:09:33,148
in the conference room.

237
00:09:33,150 --> 00:09:35,817
But you know what?
We have a few minutes.

238
00:09:35,819 --> 00:09:38,320
So you guys should definitely
finish up your conversation.

239
00:09:38,322 --> 00:09:39,387
Cool, thanks.

240
00:09:41,924 --> 00:09:45,093
So I was looking so hot...

241
00:09:45,095 --> 00:09:47,462
It has come to my attention

242
00:09:47,464 --> 00:09:52,634
that some people here
think the use of drugs

243
00:09:52,636 --> 00:09:54,502
is something to laugh about.

244
00:09:54,504 --> 00:09:55,637
We don't feel that way.

245
00:09:55,639 --> 00:09:56,705
No, not at all.

246
00:09:56,707 --> 00:09:57,739
You were the one joking around

247
00:09:57,741 --> 00:09:58,873
calling Dwight a narc.

248
00:09:58,875 --> 00:10:00,842
No.
Uh, no.

249
00:10:00,844 --> 00:10:03,445
That was a test.
I was testing you.

250
00:10:03,447 --> 00:10:04,980
And you all failed.

251
00:10:05,948 --> 00:10:07,382
Miserably.

252
00:10:07,384 --> 00:10:09,718
When I said
that Dwight was a narc,

253
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:10,885
how many of you defended him?

254
00:10:10,887 --> 00:10:12,754
How many of you said,
"Hey, you know what?

255
00:10:12,756 --> 00:10:13,955
"He's right.

256
00:10:13,957 --> 00:10:16,591
"What he's doing
is protecting this office

257
00:10:16,593 --> 00:10:17,892
from the evils of drugs"?

258
00:10:17,894 --> 00:10:19,160
Thank you, Michael.

259
00:10:19,162 --> 00:10:21,262
I am ridiculously
anti-drug.

260
00:10:21,264 --> 00:10:24,899
I am so anti-drug that I am
above suspicion

261
00:10:24,901 --> 00:10:27,168
in any way
that involved suspicion...

262
00:10:27,170 --> 00:10:29,337
or testing of any kind.

263
00:10:29,339 --> 00:10:32,040
Drugs ruin lives, people.

264
00:10:32,042 --> 00:10:35,276
Drugs destroy careers.

265
00:10:35,278 --> 00:10:36,778
Take Cheech and Chong.

266
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:39,414
Everybody knows that
Cheech and Chong are funny.

267
00:10:39,416 --> 00:10:41,282
But just imagine
how funny they would be

268
00:10:41,284 --> 00:10:44,219
if they didn't smoke pot.

269
00:10:44,221 --> 00:10:45,787
I want everybody
to take a look to their left.

270
00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:50,358
Now I want everybody
to take a look to their right.

271
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:54,029
One of those people will be dead

272
00:10:54,031 --> 00:10:57,599
from drug use at some point
in their lives.

273
00:10:57,601 --> 00:11:00,201
This year, more people

274
00:11:00,203 --> 00:11:03,038
will use cocaine
than will read a book

275
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,072
to their children.

276
00:11:04,074 --> 00:11:05,507
Where did you get these facts?

277
00:11:05,509 --> 00:11:06,941
Are these facts scaring you?

278
00:11:06,943 --> 00:11:08,009
Or are they not?

279
00:11:08,011 --> 00:11:09,110
They are not.

280
00:11:09,112 --> 00:11:12,781
Do you think
that smoking drugs is cool?

281
00:11:12,783 --> 00:11:15,817
Do you think
that doing alcohol is cool?

282
00:11:15,819 --> 00:11:16,951
No, I don't.

283
00:11:16,953 --> 00:11:18,253
I have a glass of red wine
with dinner

284
00:11:18,255 --> 00:11:20,755
about once a week
for the antioxidants.

285
00:11:20,757 --> 00:11:21,790
Okay, enough.
Enough.

286
00:11:21,792 --> 00:11:22,957
Enough!

287
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:28,430
I have written down a list
of illegal drugs.

288
00:11:28,432 --> 00:11:29,664
Take a gander.

289
00:11:29,666 --> 00:11:32,400
How many of these
are you familiar with?

290
00:11:32,402 --> 00:11:34,369
Hookah is not
an illegal drug, Michael.

291
00:11:34,371 --> 00:11:35,470
Yes, it is.

292
00:11:35,472 --> 00:11:37,105
No, it's not.

293
00:11:37,107 --> 00:11:39,140
It's a type of pipe.

294
00:11:39,142 --> 00:11:42,277
You can fill it with tobacco,
often mixed with fruit, or...

295
00:11:42,279 --> 00:11:44,012
Okay, you know what, Toby?

296
00:11:44,014 --> 00:11:45,346
Pam, could you take this down?

297
00:11:45,348 --> 00:11:48,049
In addition to Toby's urine
being tested,

298
00:11:48,051 --> 00:11:50,051
I would like to test
his blood and his hair.

299
00:11:50,053 --> 00:11:51,119
You can't do that.

300
00:11:51,121 --> 00:11:53,955
I can test anyone randomly.

301
00:11:53,957 --> 00:11:55,356
And I have chosen you randomly.

302
00:11:55,358 --> 00:11:56,391
That's not random.

303
00:11:56,393 --> 00:11:58,460
Okay, enie, meanie, miney, moe.

304
00:11:58,462 --> 00:12:00,261
Is random.

305
00:12:00,263 --> 00:12:01,596
Okay, you know what?

306
00:12:01,598 --> 00:12:02,897
I'm gonna need a volunteer

307
00:12:02,899 --> 00:12:04,833
to select one of these words.

308
00:12:04,835 --> 00:12:09,003
And tell us of something...
tragic that happened

309
00:12:09,005 --> 00:12:11,573
in either their lives
or the lives of a loved one.

310
00:12:12,942 --> 00:12:14,042
Yeah, Pam.

311
00:12:14,044 --> 00:12:17,712
I know that Jim
has an amazing story

312
00:12:17,714 --> 00:12:20,014
about a relative of his
who got caught up

313
00:12:20,016 --> 00:12:21,649
in the world of drugs.

314
00:12:21,651 --> 00:12:22,684
Really?

315
00:12:22,686 --> 00:12:23,785
Mmm-hmm.

316
00:12:23,787 --> 00:12:26,020
Jim, it's okay.
You can...

317
00:12:27,256 --> 00:12:29,824
This would be a good place
to let it out, Jim.

318
00:12:29,826 --> 00:12:30,825
These are people you can trust.

319
00:12:30,827 --> 00:12:32,994
These are people
who care about you.

320
00:12:32,996 --> 00:12:34,195
It's okay.

321
00:12:34,197 --> 00:12:36,331
Just... we will
not judge you.

322
00:12:36,333 --> 00:12:38,032
We are here to not judge you.

323
00:12:38,034 --> 00:12:40,635
Oh, he's doing it.
Okay.

324
00:12:45,374 --> 00:12:47,175
It's okay.

325
00:12:58,821 --> 00:12:59,954
Oh.

326
00:13:01,690 --> 00:13:03,258
Okay, are you sure?

327
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:06,094
That looked like
it was gonna be good.

328
00:13:06,096 --> 00:13:08,563
All right.
Okay, well...

329
00:13:08,565 --> 00:13:10,098
Wow!

330
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:12,667
He really pulled out
the big guns.

331
00:13:12,669 --> 00:13:14,369
Fake crying.

332
00:13:15,104 --> 00:13:16,738
Did not expect that.

333
00:13:17,807 --> 00:13:22,343
The point I'm trying to make
with all of this, people,

334
00:13:22,345 --> 00:13:24,112
is that I hate drugs.

335
00:13:24,114 --> 00:13:25,980
I hate them.

336
00:13:25,982 --> 00:13:29,217
And based upon what I have seen,

337
00:13:29,219 --> 00:13:32,153
you all don't quite hate 'em
as much as I do.

338
00:13:32,155 --> 00:13:34,923
So you are going
to have a drug test.

339
00:13:34,925 --> 00:13:36,090
And I am not.

340
00:13:36,092 --> 00:13:37,225
No, you will be tested.

341
00:13:37,227 --> 00:13:38,293
Yes, I... no,
will not be.

342
00:13:38,295 --> 00:13:39,494
No, you will be.

343
00:13:39,496 --> 00:13:41,362
That is the law
according to the rules.

344
00:13:41,364 --> 00:13:42,597
Okay.

345
00:13:42,599 --> 00:13:44,432
Well, Dwight, just know...

346
00:13:44,434 --> 00:13:46,167
that I've been very busy today.

347
00:13:46,169 --> 00:13:48,203
And I've got a lot
of work to do.

348
00:13:48,205 --> 00:13:50,004
And I wasn't planning
on going to the bathroom.

349
00:13:50,006 --> 00:13:51,139
And I don't even know
if anything's

350
00:13:51,141 --> 00:13:52,273
gonna come out, okay?

351
00:13:52,275 --> 00:13:54,309
So, good.
Thank you.

352
00:13:56,946 --> 00:13:58,146
Hi, Linda.

353
00:13:58,148 --> 00:13:59,581
Dwight Schrute.
Assistant Regional Manager.

354
00:13:59,583 --> 00:14:02,083
You might remember
testing my urine

355
00:14:02,085 --> 00:14:04,118
a few years back
when I was applying

356
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:05,920
to be a Volunteer
Sheriff's Deputy.

357
00:14:05,922 --> 00:14:07,589
We test a lot of urine.

358
00:14:07,591 --> 00:14:09,257
Mine was green.

359
00:14:09,259 --> 00:14:12,260
Oh, right.

360
00:14:12,262 --> 00:14:13,294
How are you?

361
00:14:13,296 --> 00:14:14,362
I'm all better.

362
00:14:14,364 --> 00:14:15,830
So I need you to do some work

363
00:14:15,832 --> 00:14:17,198
on the St. Andrew's account.

364
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,333
I need your urine.

365
00:14:18,335 --> 00:14:19,834
I need some filing done.

366
00:14:19,836 --> 00:14:20,835
What kind of filing?

367
00:14:20,837 --> 00:14:23,438
That... just forget it.
Just the urine.

368
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:26,307
That goes directly
to the tester.

369
00:14:26,309 --> 00:14:27,575
Just...

370
00:14:33,649 --> 00:14:35,216
I need your urine.

371
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:39,120
Like, in a cup?

372
00:14:39,122 --> 00:14:41,489
Yes, in a cup.
We're not animals, Dwight.

373
00:14:41,491 --> 00:14:43,157
For what purpose?

374
00:14:43,159 --> 00:14:44,292
It's none of your business.

375
00:14:44,294 --> 00:14:45,560
Then I refuse.

376
00:14:45,562 --> 00:14:47,095
Okay, all right.
Just...

377
00:14:47,097 --> 00:14:49,964
I went to
an Alicia Keys concert.

378
00:14:50,766 --> 00:14:52,267
Over the weekend.

379
00:14:53,402 --> 00:14:57,705
And I think I may have
gotten high accidentally

380
00:14:57,707 --> 00:14:59,540
by a girl with a lip ring.

381
00:15:00,342 --> 00:15:02,010
Are you serious?

382
00:15:05,414 --> 00:15:09,817
I need clean urine for the lady.

383
00:15:13,889 --> 00:15:14,923
But that's illegal.

384
00:15:14,925 --> 00:15:16,891
Don't think of it that way.

385
00:15:16,893 --> 00:15:18,860
It's like...

386
00:15:18,862 --> 00:15:20,662
Urine goes all over the place,
you know?

387
00:15:20,664 --> 00:15:21,763
There's no controlling it.

388
00:15:21,765 --> 00:15:23,798
It just...
Not my urine.

389
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:25,867
A cup could find its way
under the urine.

390
00:15:25,869 --> 00:15:27,368
It might be an accident.

391
00:15:27,370 --> 00:15:30,004
Were you forced to do drugs
at this concert?

392
00:15:30,006 --> 00:15:31,472
Is something wrong?

393
00:15:31,474 --> 00:15:32,640
Look, just...

394
00:15:34,877 --> 00:15:36,411
Just fill up the cup.

395
00:15:41,884 --> 00:15:43,952
Do you want to
give Michael your urine?

396
00:15:45,955 --> 00:15:48,589
I want him to have
all the urine he needs.

397
00:15:50,059 --> 00:15:51,526
You're not gonna get
my permission on this.

398
00:15:51,528 --> 00:15:52,694
I know that.

399
00:15:52,696 --> 00:15:54,362
Don't you think I know that?

400
00:15:56,899 --> 00:15:59,067
Yeah, we do testing
all over the country.

401
00:15:59,069 --> 00:16:00,935
Cool.

402
00:16:00,937 --> 00:16:02,036
Hey, are you guys hiring?

403
00:16:02,038 --> 00:16:05,373
You wanna work
at the urinalysis lab?

404
00:16:06,942 --> 00:16:08,843
Yeah, maybe.

405
00:16:14,617 --> 00:16:17,518
My father's name
was Dwight Schrute.

406
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:22,924
My grandfather's name
was Dwight Schrute.

407
00:16:22,926 --> 00:16:28,629
His father's name?
Dwiged Schrued.

408
00:16:28,631 --> 00:16:30,465
Amish.

409
00:16:35,871 --> 00:16:38,239
I loved my father very much.

410
00:16:38,241 --> 00:16:40,475
Every morning
he'd wake up at dawn

411
00:16:40,477 --> 00:16:42,877
and make us biscuits with gravy.

412
00:16:42,879 --> 00:16:44,245
When I was little, my dad and I

413
00:16:44,247 --> 00:16:45,847
played a lot of games together.

414
00:16:45,849 --> 00:16:47,382
My dad cheated a lot,

415
00:16:47,384 --> 00:16:49,250
but I never busted him on it.

416
00:16:49,252 --> 00:16:51,352
I would have, except I didn't
know about it.

417
00:16:51,354 --> 00:16:53,087
He didn't tell me
'til years later.

418
00:16:53,089 --> 00:16:55,456
I was shocked when I found out.

419
00:16:57,526 --> 00:16:59,427
What?

420
00:16:59,429 --> 00:17:01,529
Did you wanna tell me something?

421
00:17:01,531 --> 00:17:03,898
You look like
you wanna tell me something.

422
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:05,133
You look like you have something

423
00:17:05,135 --> 00:17:06,868
really important to say
and you just can't

424
00:17:06,870 --> 00:17:08,302
for some reason.

425
00:17:10,205 --> 00:17:12,306
Come on, you can tell me.

426
00:17:12,308 --> 00:17:16,244
Jim, you can tell me anything.

427
00:17:52,347 --> 00:17:54,182
I'd like a magazine.

428
00:17:54,184 --> 00:17:55,750
We just need urine, sir.

429
00:17:55,752 --> 00:17:57,452
I'd still like one.

430
00:17:58,253 --> 00:17:59,554
Dwight.

431
00:17:59,556 --> 00:18:01,589
Well...

432
00:18:01,591 --> 00:18:03,691
I passed the test, thanks to you

433
00:18:03,693 --> 00:18:05,359
and your untainted pee.

434
00:18:05,361 --> 00:18:06,994
Thank you very much.

435
00:18:06,996 --> 00:18:08,029
That's great.

436
00:18:08,031 --> 00:18:09,597
What's wrong?

437
00:18:09,599 --> 00:18:10,898
Where's your costume?

438
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:12,533
It's a uniform.

439
00:18:12,535 --> 00:18:15,136
And I turned it in today
when I tendered my resignation.

440
00:18:15,138 --> 00:18:17,371
Why? What...

441
00:18:17,373 --> 00:18:20,675
I took an oath
when I was sworn in.

442
00:18:20,677 --> 00:18:23,177
And I broke that oath today.

443
00:18:41,063 --> 00:18:42,130
Here.

444
00:18:43,499 --> 00:18:44,565
Just buy it from me.

445
00:18:46,235 --> 00:18:47,502
I haven't talked
to you in hours,

446
00:18:47,504 --> 00:18:48,803
and it's been weird.

447
00:18:48,805 --> 00:18:50,071
And I really wanna know

448
00:18:50,073 --> 00:18:51,606
what the hell's going on
with Dwight.

449
00:19:05,687 --> 00:19:07,488
Hi.
Hey.

450
00:19:07,490 --> 00:19:08,856
How much time do you have left
on your break?

451
00:19:08,858 --> 00:19:09,957
10 minutes.

452
00:19:13,228 --> 00:19:16,864
Since you did such a good job
with the investigation,

453
00:19:16,866 --> 00:19:19,200
I decided to pull a few strings,

454
00:19:19,202 --> 00:19:21,402
call in a few favors.

455
00:19:21,404 --> 00:19:22,870
And I've decided to make you

456
00:19:22,872 --> 00:19:25,673
Official Security Supervisor
of the branch.

457
00:19:25,675 --> 00:19:27,675
Really?

458
00:19:27,677 --> 00:19:29,510
Yes, sir.
That's fantastic.

459
00:19:29,512 --> 00:19:31,913
'Cause I've always felt
that the security here sucked.

460
00:19:33,515 --> 00:19:35,716
So you wanna...

461
00:19:37,686 --> 00:19:39,220
"Dwight K. Schrute,

462
00:19:39,222 --> 00:19:42,557
"I hereby declare you
an honorary volunteer corporal

463
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:46,794
in charge of assisting
all activity security."

464
00:19:46,796 --> 00:19:47,828
Good, okay?

465
00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:48,896
Here's your badge.

466
00:19:50,365 --> 00:19:51,832
Thank you, Michael.

467
00:19:51,834 --> 00:19:53,801
Very nice.

468
00:19:53,803 --> 00:19:55,970
Great.
Can I have a gun?

469
00:19:55,972 --> 00:19:58,139
No.
I don't have a gun.

470
00:19:58,141 --> 00:19:59,540
Okay.

471
00:19:59,542 --> 00:20:02,743
I'll have to bring in
my bow staff.

472
00:20:02,745 --> 00:20:05,413
I don't think so.
Don't.

473
00:20:05,415 --> 00:20:06,480
Good.
Thank you, Michael.

474
00:20:07,550 --> 00:20:09,116
No... oh...

475
00:20:11,987 --> 00:20:13,187
I need to go over
some details with you.

476
00:20:13,189 --> 00:20:14,488
First of all...
All right, well...

477
00:20:14,490 --> 00:20:16,891
Thank you.

478
00:20:16,893 --> 00:20:19,260
How many orange traffic cones
do you have?

479
00:20:19,262 --> 00:20:20,394
Two.

480
00:20:20,396 --> 00:20:22,964
Oh... God.

481
00:20:22,966 --> 00:20:26,200
Wow, what a terrible day
to not be able to talk.

482
00:20:26,202 --> 00:20:28,703
Dwight was literally carrying
around his own urine

483
00:20:28,705 --> 00:20:30,104
and dressed like
one of the Village People.

484
00:20:30,106 --> 00:20:32,607
Why does he do the things
that he does for Michael?

485
00:20:32,609 --> 00:20:34,075
I just don't get it.

486
00:20:34,077 --> 00:20:36,110
What is he getting
out of that relationship?
