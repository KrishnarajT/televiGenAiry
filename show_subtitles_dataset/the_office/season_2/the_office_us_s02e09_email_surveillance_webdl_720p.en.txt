1
00:00:00,964 --> 00:00:01,931
It is Friday morning.

2
00:00:01,933 --> 00:00:03,766
And it is another beautiful day

3
00:00:03,768 --> 00:00:07,202
in Scranton, Pennsylvania.

4
00:00:08,371 --> 00:00:10,372
Oh, my God.

5
00:00:11,474 --> 00:00:12,574
Oh!

6
00:00:15,512 --> 00:00:18,948
Pick up, pick up,
pick up, pick up.

7
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:22,051
Oh, we have
a serious problem here.

8
00:00:22,053 --> 00:00:23,085
All right, everybody.

9
00:00:23,087 --> 00:00:24,486
Lock the doors.
Turn off the lights.

10
00:00:24,488 --> 00:00:25,621
Pretend you're not here.

11
00:00:25,623 --> 00:00:27,456
Are we in danger?

12
00:00:28,425 --> 00:00:31,493
There's no time to think
about it. This is real.

13
00:00:31,495 --> 00:00:33,896
Just shh, everybody.

14
00:00:38,869 --> 00:00:40,769
Michael, should I call the...

15
00:00:40,771 --> 00:00:42,871
What?

16
00:00:42,873 --> 00:00:45,240
The I.T. tech guy and me

17
00:00:45,242 --> 00:00:48,610
did not get off
to a great start.

18
00:01:22,112 --> 00:01:24,046
Yeah, I tried
to install it myself,

19
00:01:24,048 --> 00:01:25,781
but you guys have these things

20
00:01:25,783 --> 00:01:28,183
so password-protected.

21
00:01:28,185 --> 00:01:30,119
That just means you
have to enter your password.

22
00:01:30,121 --> 00:01:31,420
Uh...

23
00:01:31,422 --> 00:01:33,389
What's your password, Michael?

24
00:01:33,391 --> 00:01:35,324
Um, it's...

25
00:01:35,326 --> 00:01:38,494
Oh. 1, 2, 3, 4.
Yes.

26
00:01:45,335 --> 00:01:47,870
Michael...
Aah! Gah!

27
00:01:47,872 --> 00:01:49,571
Please don't do that.

28
00:01:49,573 --> 00:01:51,006
Okay, I'm sorry.
What is going on in there?

29
00:01:51,008 --> 00:01:53,575
Why is he here?
What are you doing?

30
00:01:53,577 --> 00:01:54,843
I can't tell you.

31
00:01:54,845 --> 00:01:55,944
You have to tell me.

32
00:01:55,946 --> 00:01:57,112
I don't have
to tell you anything.

33
00:01:57,114 --> 00:01:59,181
Look, Michael.

34
00:01:59,183 --> 00:02:01,283
I know you don't want to
have to think about this,

35
00:02:01,285 --> 00:02:02,651
but if something were
to happen to you,

36
00:02:02,653 --> 00:02:04,753
God forbid, then I would
need to know

37
00:02:04,755 --> 00:02:06,055
in order to take over.

38
00:02:06,057 --> 00:02:07,423
Dwight, nothing is
gonna happen to me. Okay?

39
00:02:07,425 --> 00:02:08,590
I'm in the best shape
of my life.

40
00:02:08,592 --> 00:02:09,925
Look at at this. Grr!

41
00:02:09,927 --> 00:02:10,926
Yeah, but that doesn't matter.

42
00:02:10,928 --> 00:02:12,194
You could get a brain aneurysm.

43
00:02:12,196 --> 00:02:13,429
I'm not gonna...
Or hit by a car.

44
00:02:13,431 --> 00:02:14,930
Stop.
Or a bus or a train.

45
00:02:14,932 --> 00:02:16,365
You could get poisoned.
Fall down a well.

46
00:02:16,367 --> 00:02:17,900
Step on a mine. Choke.

47
00:02:17,902 --> 00:02:20,269
Okay, if I step on a mine
in Scranton, Pennsylvania,

48
00:02:20,271 --> 00:02:22,004
and die, you can have
my job. Okay?

49
00:02:22,006 --> 00:02:23,906
Why don't you just go away?

50
00:02:23,908 --> 00:02:25,140
There are certain things

51
00:02:25,142 --> 00:02:27,776
a boss does not share
with his employees.

52
00:02:27,778 --> 00:02:30,779
His salary.
That would depress them.

53
00:02:30,781 --> 00:02:32,514
His bed.

54
00:02:34,417 --> 00:02:37,920
And I am not going to tell them

55
00:02:37,922 --> 00:02:39,555
that I'll be reading
their e-mails.

56
00:02:40,690 --> 00:02:42,191
So how do you search?

57
00:02:42,193 --> 00:02:44,359
By keyword phrase.

58
00:02:44,361 --> 00:02:46,562
Try profits.

59
00:02:46,564 --> 00:02:48,697
No, try Michael Scott.

60
00:02:48,699 --> 00:02:52,568
Michael, boss, and funny.

61
00:02:55,406 --> 00:02:58,774
Oh, my God! Wow!

62
00:02:58,776 --> 00:03:00,175
E-mail from Stanley.

63
00:03:00,177 --> 00:03:02,811
Stanley.
Terribly nice guy.

64
00:03:02,813 --> 00:03:04,246
"Sorry I didn't
write back sooner.

65
00:03:04,248 --> 00:03:05,347
"I can't go to the game tonight

66
00:03:05,349 --> 00:03:06,882
"because my boss
Michael is an ass

67
00:03:06,884 --> 00:03:08,083
and making
me stay late."

68
00:03:08,085 --> 00:03:10,552
Well, Stanley's an ass.

69
00:03:10,554 --> 00:03:12,321
Not one of our harder workers.

70
00:03:18,094 --> 00:03:19,728
Hey, what's the deal, Michael?

71
00:03:19,730 --> 00:03:21,096
Why are you spying
on our computers?

72
00:03:21,098 --> 00:03:22,931
Oh, no!

73
00:03:22,933 --> 00:03:24,867
Everybody, Oscar's gone crazy.

74
00:03:24,869 --> 00:03:26,768
What other ghost stories
do you have for us?

75
00:03:26,770 --> 00:03:30,005
That I'm a robot?

76
00:03:30,007 --> 00:03:33,308
I will destroy
everything in my path.

77
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:34,343
Actually, we just...

78
00:03:34,345 --> 00:03:37,146
Boop! Beep! Bop!

79
00:03:37,148 --> 00:03:38,780
Okay.
Bonk!

80
00:03:38,782 --> 00:03:41,917
Boop boop. Oil can.

81
00:03:41,919 --> 00:03:44,620
Oil can.

82
00:03:44,622 --> 00:03:46,121
Tin Man.

83
00:03:46,123 --> 00:03:48,624
Actually we just got
a memo from I.T.

84
00:03:48,626 --> 00:03:50,392
saying you're doing
e-mail surveillance.

85
00:03:50,394 --> 00:03:53,128
Oh, what? No, that defeats
the whole purpose.

86
00:03:53,130 --> 00:03:55,330
So it's true? You have
access to our e-mails?

87
00:03:55,332 --> 00:03:56,365
You know what the problem is?

88
00:03:56,367 --> 00:03:57,499
I think I do.

89
00:03:57,501 --> 00:03:59,368
The problem is that when people

90
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:01,370
hear the term "Big Brother"

91
00:04:01,372 --> 00:04:04,206
they immediately think
it's scary or bad.

92
00:04:04,208 --> 00:04:07,376
But I don't. I think,
"Wow. I love my Big Brother."

93
00:04:07,378 --> 00:04:10,312
I gotta erase a lot of stuff.

94
00:04:10,314 --> 00:04:13,549
A lot of stuff.

95
00:04:13,551 --> 00:04:15,784
Oh, hey.
Just so you know.

96
00:04:15,786 --> 00:04:17,653
If you have
any sensitive e-mails,

97
00:04:17,655 --> 00:04:19,988
they need to be
deleted immediately.

98
00:04:19,990 --> 00:04:20,989
I know.

99
00:04:20,991 --> 00:04:22,524
Good.

100
00:04:24,727 --> 00:04:25,861
Hey.

101
00:04:29,632 --> 00:04:30,966
Something just happened.

102
00:04:30,968 --> 00:04:33,535
Dwight just told Angela
that she has to delete

103
00:04:33,537 --> 00:04:35,704
all of her sensitive
e-mails immediately.

104
00:04:35,706 --> 00:04:38,006
What?
I know.

105
00:04:38,008 --> 00:04:39,441
Hmm.

106
00:04:39,443 --> 00:04:40,709
Do you think
that they're like...

107
00:04:40,711 --> 00:04:42,544
No.
Right, no.

108
00:04:42,546 --> 00:04:45,180
Ugh! Ew.

109
00:04:45,182 --> 00:04:46,315
Ew, ew, ew.

110
00:04:48,418 --> 00:04:49,551
Maybe.

111
00:04:49,553 --> 00:04:53,255
It's like squishing a spider
under a book.

112
00:04:53,257 --> 00:04:56,358
It's gonna be really gross,
but I have to look

113
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:58,961
and make sure
that it's really dead.

114
00:04:58,963 --> 00:05:02,965
So if you guys see anything...

115
00:05:02,967 --> 00:05:05,367
Hey, Dwight? Um...

116
00:05:05,369 --> 00:05:07,102
My friend is kind of into

117
00:05:07,104 --> 00:05:08,637
these two girls
that he works with.

118
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:11,673
Nice.
One is tall and brunette.

119
00:05:11,675 --> 00:05:14,977
And the other one
is short and blonde

120
00:05:14,979 --> 00:05:18,080
and perky
and kind of judgmental.

121
00:05:18,082 --> 00:05:19,881
Who do you think
he should choose?

122
00:05:21,184 --> 00:05:24,386
Does he have access
to their medical records?

123
00:05:24,388 --> 00:05:25,754
Um...

124
00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:30,058
I think one of the greatest
things about modern America

125
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:32,527
is the computerization
of medical records.

126
00:05:32,529 --> 00:05:34,263
As a volunteer sheriff,
I can look up

127
00:05:34,265 --> 00:05:38,367
anyone's psychiatric records
or surgical histories.

128
00:05:38,369 --> 00:05:40,035
Yeast infections.

129
00:05:40,037 --> 00:05:42,204
There are huge number

130
00:05:42,206 --> 00:05:43,905
of yeast infections
in this county.

131
00:05:45,541 --> 00:05:49,778
Probably because
we're down river

132
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:52,014
from that old bread factory.

133
00:05:52,016 --> 00:05:55,017
Meredith has an E-vite

134
00:05:55,019 --> 00:05:56,752
from Jim.

135
00:05:56,754 --> 00:05:59,755
"Barbecue at Jim's tonight."

136
00:05:59,757 --> 00:06:03,825
Tonight? Wonder where
my e-vitation is?

137
00:06:03,827 --> 00:06:05,494
Click on guest list.

138
00:06:05,496 --> 00:06:07,562
Angela. Stanley. Oscar.

139
00:06:07,564 --> 00:06:12,467
Meredith. Phyllis.
Kevin. Creed.

140
00:06:12,469 --> 00:06:14,069
Must be...

141
00:06:16,105 --> 00:06:18,006
No.

142
00:06:23,012 --> 00:06:25,147
Hey, Angela.
How's it going?

143
00:06:25,149 --> 00:06:26,648
It's okay.

144
00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:27,883
Listen, are you bringing anyone

145
00:06:27,885 --> 00:06:29,217
to Jim's party tonight?

146
00:06:29,219 --> 00:06:30,786
No. Are we supposed to?

147
00:06:30,788 --> 00:06:33,789
No. I mean I don't know.
I don't think so.

148
00:06:33,791 --> 00:06:36,425
Hmm. Excuse me.

149
00:06:36,427 --> 00:06:37,993
Oh.

150
00:06:49,272 --> 00:06:51,373
There's always a distance

151
00:06:51,375 --> 00:06:53,408
between a boss
and the employees.

152
00:06:53,410 --> 00:06:56,511
It is just nature's rule.

153
00:06:56,513 --> 00:06:58,413
It's intimidation, mostly.

154
00:06:58,415 --> 00:07:00,982
It's the awareness
that they are not me.

155
00:07:00,984 --> 00:07:05,153
I do think that
I am very approachable

156
00:07:05,155 --> 00:07:08,223
as one of the guys.

157
00:07:08,225 --> 00:07:10,559
But maybe I need to be
even approachabler.

158
00:07:12,128 --> 00:07:13,695
Ahem.

159
00:07:13,697 --> 00:07:15,397
That's pretty, um...
Yeah.

160
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:19,000
Are you gonna eat with us?

161
00:07:19,002 --> 00:07:20,469
Of course.

162
00:07:20,471 --> 00:07:21,703
Hanging with my crew.

163
00:07:21,705 --> 00:07:24,072
Crew that I am one of.

164
00:07:24,074 --> 00:07:28,310
Hanging with my Cup of Noodles.

165
00:07:28,312 --> 00:07:30,479
This is a meal in a cup
right here.

166
00:07:30,481 --> 00:07:32,848
Hot, tasty.
Reminds me of college.

167
00:07:32,850 --> 00:07:36,385
Lived on this stuff.
Brain food. Mmm.

168
00:07:36,387 --> 00:07:38,720
You know what I really,
really miss about college?

169
00:07:38,722 --> 00:07:41,390
The parties.
Everybody'd go.

170
00:07:41,392 --> 00:07:44,893
The athletes. The nerds.
The professors.

171
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:46,995
The professors would
go to the parties?

172
00:07:46,997 --> 00:07:50,332
Yeah. They were the most fun.

173
00:07:50,334 --> 00:07:52,334
We always invited them.

174
00:07:54,737 --> 00:07:56,938
It's true.
I'm having a party.

175
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:59,941
I've got three cases
of imported beer.

176
00:07:59,943 --> 00:08:01,676
Karaoke machine.

177
00:08:01,678 --> 00:08:03,879
And I didn't invite Michael.

178
00:08:03,881 --> 00:08:06,448
So three ingredients
for a great party.

179
00:08:06,450 --> 00:08:07,916
And it's nothing personal.

180
00:08:07,918 --> 00:08:09,317
I just think if he were there,

181
00:08:09,319 --> 00:08:10,519
people wouldn't be able
to relax.

182
00:08:10,521 --> 00:08:12,187
You know, have fun.

183
00:08:12,189 --> 00:08:14,456
And my roommate wants
to meet everybody.

184
00:08:14,458 --> 00:08:17,359
Because I'm pretty sure
he thinks I'm making Dwight up.

185
00:08:18,661 --> 00:08:20,829
He is very real.

186
00:08:26,002 --> 00:08:27,402
What?

187
00:08:30,673 --> 00:08:33,475
Oh! Yes!

188
00:08:33,477 --> 00:08:35,243
Thank you.

189
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:42,984
Question.

190
00:08:42,986 --> 00:08:45,353
On the Internet, there are
several different options

191
00:08:45,355 --> 00:08:46,588
to get to your house
for the party tonight.

192
00:08:46,590 --> 00:08:49,858
Oh, um, no.
No, no, no. Keep that down.

193
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:51,092
Why?

194
00:08:51,094 --> 00:08:53,895
Because not everybody
knows about the party.

195
00:08:55,064 --> 00:08:58,133
Like who?
Who doesn't know?

196
00:08:58,135 --> 00:09:00,302
Um, Michael.

197
00:09:00,304 --> 00:09:02,037
Why just Michael?

198
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:06,308
'Cause it's a surprise.

199
00:09:06,310 --> 00:09:07,776
Is it?
Mm-hmm.

200
00:09:07,778 --> 00:09:08,777
Oh, that's perfect.

201
00:09:08,779 --> 00:09:10,345
So don't tell.

202
00:09:10,347 --> 00:09:12,214
I won't.
Okay.

203
00:09:13,182 --> 00:09:14,983
So, Dwight thinks that tonight

204
00:09:14,985 --> 00:09:16,685
is a surprise party for Michael.

205
00:09:16,687 --> 00:09:18,787
Really? That's great.
I know.

206
00:09:18,789 --> 00:09:20,822
Maybe we can get him
to hide and wait somewhere.

207
00:09:22,326 --> 00:09:23,959
Oh, man.

208
00:09:23,961 --> 00:09:25,293
Oh, you know what?
Speaking of which,

209
00:09:25,295 --> 00:09:26,895
I was just trying
to get a handle on,

210
00:09:26,897 --> 00:09:29,097
you know, numbers
for food and stuff.

211
00:09:29,099 --> 00:09:30,799
So do you think
Roy's gonna come or...

212
00:09:30,801 --> 00:09:32,400
Oh, no.
He can't make it.

213
00:09:32,402 --> 00:09:34,569
Oh, okay. Cool.

214
00:09:37,106 --> 00:09:39,274
Here.
Hey.

215
00:09:39,276 --> 00:09:41,209
Almost quitting time.

216
00:09:41,211 --> 00:09:43,945
Yep. It's 4:00.

217
00:09:43,947 --> 00:09:45,647
One more hour

218
00:09:45,649 --> 00:09:48,350
to take care of anything
you forgot to do.

219
00:09:50,686 --> 00:09:54,055
Hey, I don't know if you
have any plans tonight,

220
00:09:54,057 --> 00:09:56,124
but if you don't,
we could hang out.

221
00:09:58,661 --> 00:10:02,497
Oh, um... I can't.

222
00:10:02,499 --> 00:10:03,865
You have plans?
Mm-hmm. Yeah, I do.

223
00:10:03,867 --> 00:10:05,800
Yeah, I do too, I do too.
Oh, you do?

224
00:10:05,802 --> 00:10:07,502
Big plans. I do, yeah.

225
00:10:07,504 --> 00:10:08,737
Because you just said
you wanted to hang out...

226
00:10:08,739 --> 00:10:10,338
Tonight, I can't do it tonight.

227
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:12,874
No. Improv class.
I have improv class.

228
00:10:12,876 --> 00:10:14,609
Hanging out with my improv buds.
Really?

229
00:10:14,611 --> 00:10:16,111
Yeah. Oh, that sounds
like a lot of fun.

230
00:10:16,113 --> 00:10:17,846
Oh, it's the best.
It is the best.

231
00:10:17,848 --> 00:10:19,447
I would not miss it
for the world.

232
00:10:19,449 --> 00:10:22,551
But if something else came up,
I would definitely not go.

233
00:10:24,987 --> 00:10:26,555
Improv sounds great.

234
00:10:27,857 --> 00:10:28,924
It is.

235
00:10:33,229 --> 00:10:34,496
Okay.

236
00:10:34,498 --> 00:10:36,765
All right.

237
00:10:37,801 --> 00:10:39,067
What?

238
00:10:39,069 --> 00:10:40,869
I think Stanley just coughed.

239
00:10:48,745 --> 00:10:51,680
Hey, Pam. Do you need me to walk
you to your vehicular transport?

240
00:10:51,682 --> 00:10:52,681
No, thanks.

241
00:10:52,683 --> 00:10:53,848
All right.

242
00:10:53,850 --> 00:10:55,083
Oscar, you have
big plans tonight...

243
00:10:55,085 --> 00:10:56,585
I'm on a call.
Okay.

244
00:10:56,587 --> 00:10:59,287
Kevin. Big man, big man.
What are you doing tonight?

245
00:10:59,289 --> 00:11:00,288
Where you off to?

246
00:11:00,290 --> 00:11:01,556
My brother is in town

247
00:11:01,558 --> 00:11:04,726
and we are going to see
the Alaska Film Festival at...

248
00:11:04,728 --> 00:11:06,795
Okay, all right.

249
00:11:06,797 --> 00:11:08,430
Hey, Angela.
Rushy, rushy.

250
00:11:08,432 --> 00:11:09,764
Where you rushing off to?

251
00:11:09,766 --> 00:11:11,199
I'm just leaving for the day.

252
00:11:11,201 --> 00:11:12,867
Yeah, well, duh.
Where are you headed?

253
00:11:12,869 --> 00:11:15,236
Charity. Bake Drive.

254
00:11:15,238 --> 00:11:17,272
Liar! You are a liar.

255
00:11:17,274 --> 00:11:18,873
No, I'm not!

256
00:11:18,875 --> 00:11:21,142
Ohh. Dwight.

257
00:11:21,144 --> 00:11:23,178
Oh, Dwight, my loyal compadre.

258
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:25,313
You and I are hanging tonight.

259
00:11:25,315 --> 00:11:27,782
The two of us.
We are celebrating

260
00:11:27,784 --> 00:11:30,185
our freedom and our manhood.

261
00:11:30,187 --> 00:11:31,620
You know what?

262
00:11:31,622 --> 00:11:33,121
Why don't we watch that show
you've been wanting to watch?

263
00:11:33,123 --> 00:11:35,423
That stupid Battleship Galaxy...

264
00:11:35,425 --> 00:11:36,725
Battlestar Galactica?

265
00:11:36,727 --> 00:11:39,327
That's... Whatever stupid show
you want to watch.

266
00:11:39,329 --> 00:11:41,563
I can't tonight.
Unfortunately I've got plans.

267
00:11:41,565 --> 00:11:45,734
I have to go to practice.
Soccer practice.

268
00:11:45,736 --> 00:11:47,268
I didn't know you played
soccer, Dwight.

269
00:11:47,270 --> 00:11:48,403
Clarinet.

270
00:11:48,838 --> 00:11:50,338
You too, Dwight?

271
00:11:50,906 --> 00:11:52,273
Have fun tonight.

272
00:11:52,275 --> 00:11:53,708
Whatever it is
that you're doing.

273
00:11:53,710 --> 00:11:56,578
And I'll see you Monday.

274
00:11:58,781 --> 00:12:00,515
He has no idea.

275
00:12:06,223 --> 00:12:07,589
Quick announcement, everybody.

276
00:12:07,591 --> 00:12:08,890
If I could have
everybody's attention.

277
00:12:08,892 --> 00:12:10,525
We do have wine in the kitchen.

278
00:12:10,527 --> 00:12:13,261
And there is beer
available on the porch.

279
00:12:13,263 --> 00:12:14,562
And despite
what you might think,

280
00:12:14,564 --> 00:12:15,997
it's not all for Meredith
and Kelly.

281
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:17,399
So please enjoy.

282
00:12:17,401 --> 00:12:19,934
Jim, you really think
this is a good idea?

283
00:12:19,936 --> 00:12:22,003
Huh? A hide-a-key rock?

284
00:12:22,005 --> 00:12:23,538
Hey, you must be Dwight.

285
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:24,572
You don't work with us.

286
00:12:24,574 --> 00:12:25,907
That's because
Mark's my roommate.

287
00:12:25,909 --> 00:12:26,908
Oh.

288
00:12:26,910 --> 00:12:28,576
Hey, I love the Birkenstocks.

289
00:12:28,578 --> 00:12:31,913
Thanks. Yeah, I always keep
an extra set in the car

290
00:12:31,915 --> 00:12:34,049
for special occasions.

291
00:12:34,051 --> 00:12:36,017
Jim, come here.
Mm-hmm?

292
00:12:36,019 --> 00:12:38,887
When is the guest
of honor coming?

293
00:12:38,889 --> 00:12:40,555
Oh. Uh, later-ish.

294
00:12:40,557 --> 00:12:42,023
He's gonna love it!

295
00:12:42,025 --> 00:12:45,093
Great. I just wanted
to let you guys know

296
00:12:45,095 --> 00:12:47,028
that we will be taking
the tour like I promised...

297
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:48,296
Hey.
Hey!

298
00:12:48,298 --> 00:12:51,032
Just in time. Do you want
to go on a group tour?

299
00:12:51,034 --> 00:12:52,333
We were just about to leave.

300
00:12:52,335 --> 00:12:53,468
Definitely.

301
00:12:53,470 --> 00:12:54,669
Well, the group tour
is now leaving then.

302
00:12:54,671 --> 00:12:55,837
Ladies and gentlemen,
just a few things

303
00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:57,305
that we're going to be
pointing out to you today.

304
00:12:57,307 --> 00:12:59,574
You will be able
to see both bedrooms.

305
00:12:59,576 --> 00:13:01,076
And if we're lucky,

306
00:13:01,078 --> 00:13:03,344
maybe get a chance
to peek into the bathroom.

307
00:13:03,346 --> 00:13:04,713
Who knows? I have to
remind you also

308
00:13:04,715 --> 00:13:06,581
that flash photography
is prohibited.

309
00:13:06,583 --> 00:13:07,816
And as much as you can,

310
00:13:07,818 --> 00:13:09,651
please refrain
from touching things.

311
00:13:09,653 --> 00:13:11,286
I know you might want to.

312
00:13:11,288 --> 00:13:12,687
Hey, is Katie coming?

313
00:13:12,689 --> 00:13:14,389
Um, actually I haven't
talked to her in a while.

314
00:13:14,391 --> 00:13:16,725
Huh? Oh. Is it cool
if I call her?

315
00:13:16,727 --> 00:13:18,860
We'll talk about that later.

316
00:13:18,862 --> 00:13:20,128
Okay, let's get right into it.

317
00:13:20,130 --> 00:13:21,596
I need two people
for the first scene.

318
00:13:21,598 --> 00:13:24,032
Ooh, ooh, ooh!
Mr. Kotter!

319
00:13:24,034 --> 00:13:25,700
Mr. Kot-ter!

320
00:13:25,702 --> 00:13:27,769
Okay. Michael.
And...

321
00:13:29,405 --> 00:13:30,972
Anybody?

322
00:13:30,974 --> 00:13:32,240
How about Marybeth?

323
00:13:32,242 --> 00:13:35,210
Okay.
Come on.

324
00:13:35,212 --> 00:13:36,678
Okay, so you start
us off, Marybeth.

325
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:37,979
All right, great. Okay.

326
00:13:43,353 --> 00:13:44,686
Boom!
Detective Michael Scott!

327
00:13:44,688 --> 00:13:45,887
I'm with the FBI!

328
00:13:45,889 --> 00:13:48,490
Think about this. What is
the most exciting thing

329
00:13:48,492 --> 00:13:50,625
that can happen on TV
or in movies

330
00:13:50,627 --> 00:13:54,362
or in real life?
Somebody has a gun.

331
00:13:54,364 --> 00:13:56,464
That's why I always start
with a gun

332
00:13:56,466 --> 00:13:59,434
because you can't top it.
You just can't.

333
00:13:59,436 --> 00:14:01,669
I'm supposed to meet
my doctor here.

334
00:14:01,671 --> 00:14:03,872
Have you seen him?
He's a very angry midget.

335
00:14:03,874 --> 00:14:05,240
Boom! Freeze!

336
00:14:05,242 --> 00:14:06,541
Michael Scarn, FBI!

337
00:14:06,543 --> 00:14:08,076
You know what you did.

338
00:14:08,078 --> 00:14:10,245
Boom! Boom! Boom!

339
00:14:10,247 --> 00:14:11,913
Yeah, you thought
you could get away

340
00:14:11,915 --> 00:14:14,382
with your little ruse
didn't you? Didn't you?

341
00:14:14,384 --> 00:14:15,850
Well, you didn't.

342
00:14:15,852 --> 00:14:17,986
Because I know where
you hid the diamonds.

343
00:14:17,988 --> 00:14:20,388
I've been on to you and your
little friends for weeks.

344
00:14:20,390 --> 00:14:22,490
Boom! Boom! Boom!

345
00:14:22,492 --> 00:14:23,858
I'm not even in the scene!

346
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:25,026
Boom! Boom! Boom!

347
00:14:25,028 --> 00:14:26,828
Stop. Stop! Stop.

348
00:14:26,830 --> 00:14:28,930
Okay. You shot me.
Great. Stop.

349
00:14:28,932 --> 00:14:30,865
Okay, you can't just shoot
everyone in the scene.

350
00:14:30,867 --> 00:14:32,400
Well, if you hadn't
stopped the scene,

351
00:14:32,402 --> 00:14:33,701
you would've seen
where it was going.

352
00:14:33,703 --> 00:14:34,936
Okay. What about
the scene they set up?

353
00:14:34,938 --> 00:14:36,604
Boring.

354
00:14:36,606 --> 00:14:39,474
No, it wasn't.
No more guns. No, no.

355
00:14:39,476 --> 00:14:43,178
Michael, I want you to give me
all the guns you have.

356
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:46,447
Just get rid of all your guns
and give them to me.

357
00:14:46,449 --> 00:14:48,683
Great.
Bleh!

358
00:14:48,685 --> 00:14:50,185
Bleh. Okay.

359
00:14:55,991 --> 00:14:58,126
Jim's bedroom.

360
00:15:02,264 --> 00:15:05,033
See, I knew we lost
somebody on the tour.

361
00:15:05,035 --> 00:15:07,502
Cool. This is your desk.

362
00:15:07,504 --> 00:15:08,536
This is my desk.

363
00:15:08,538 --> 00:15:09,904
Your home office.

364
00:15:09,906 --> 00:15:12,640
Home office. This is it. Yeah.

365
00:15:12,642 --> 00:15:14,275
You have to sit down so I can
get the full effect.

366
00:15:14,277 --> 00:15:17,178
Okay. Sure. Will do.

367
00:15:18,948 --> 00:15:22,450
Okay, wait.
So that would make me...

368
00:15:22,452 --> 00:15:24,219
Like right here.

369
00:15:24,221 --> 00:15:26,921
Yeah. Yep, that feels
about right.

370
00:15:26,923 --> 00:15:28,656
And then Dwight would be like...

371
00:15:28,658 --> 00:15:30,758
You know what? Let's just
leave that image out of it.

372
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:32,327
Because this is a happy place.

373
00:15:32,329 --> 00:15:34,796
Happy thoughts, Pam.
Happy thoughts.

374
00:15:36,131 --> 00:15:38,666
Um... oh! Yearbook.

375
00:15:38,668 --> 00:15:40,401
Yeah, you don't have to, um...

376
00:15:40,403 --> 00:15:43,705
All right. Yes, that's
not gonna be awkward at all.

377
00:15:45,441 --> 00:15:48,676
Oh, no!
Oh, yeah.

378
00:15:48,678 --> 00:15:51,813
You were so dorky!
Thank you.

379
00:16:00,055 --> 00:16:01,356
Freeze.
I'm in.

380
00:16:01,358 --> 00:16:02,857
Do you want to go over
the rules one more time?

381
00:16:02,859 --> 00:16:04,359
No, no, no, no.

382
00:16:06,629 --> 00:16:08,529
I'm looking
in my wallet for money

383
00:16:08,531 --> 00:16:10,498
so you can tell me my fortune.

384
00:16:13,435 --> 00:16:15,470
I promise it's worth it.

385
00:16:15,472 --> 00:16:17,672
Oh, I can see you
walking out of here,

386
00:16:17,674 --> 00:16:19,574
and you're thrilled
with your reading.

387
00:16:21,811 --> 00:16:23,444
What are you...

388
00:16:30,519 --> 00:16:31,853
Michael, what did you tell him?

389
00:16:31,855 --> 00:16:33,087
Nothing.

390
00:16:33,089 --> 00:16:35,657
Then why are
his hands up? Bill?

391
00:16:35,659 --> 00:16:38,126
He told me he couldn't
show it to me,

392
00:16:38,128 --> 00:16:39,627
but he has a gun.

393
00:16:41,130 --> 00:16:42,897
Okay.
Let's call it a day.

394
00:16:42,899 --> 00:16:45,566
Good. That was good.

395
00:16:45,568 --> 00:16:47,368
Good work, everybody.

396
00:16:47,370 --> 00:16:51,739
Angela, burger, dog?
Having fun?

397
00:16:51,741 --> 00:16:54,309
I got sap on me.

398
00:16:54,311 --> 00:16:56,477
Chicken, hot dog, burger.

399
00:16:56,479 --> 00:16:58,413
I'm a vegetarian.

400
00:16:58,415 --> 00:17:00,615
There's soda inside.

401
00:17:00,617 --> 00:17:01,816
Oh.

402
00:17:01,818 --> 00:17:02,984
I didn't think the premium

403
00:17:02,986 --> 00:17:04,052
laser color copy batch

404
00:17:04,054 --> 00:17:05,453
would sell as well as it did.

405
00:17:05,455 --> 00:17:07,789
It surprised us all.
I'll tell you why. Because...

406
00:17:07,791 --> 00:17:08,990
I'm sorry, guys.

407
00:17:08,992 --> 00:17:10,825
Can we please not talk
about paper?

408
00:17:10,827 --> 00:17:12,327
There's gotta be something else
that we can talk about.

409
00:17:13,796 --> 00:17:15,029
Ahem.

410
00:17:18,834 --> 00:17:21,836
Um, I think it's all right.

411
00:17:21,838 --> 00:17:24,806
I mean, jeez.
It's late already.

412
00:17:24,808 --> 00:17:26,808
Hmm.

413
00:17:28,877 --> 00:17:30,345
Hey, Phyllis.

414
00:17:30,347 --> 00:17:32,013
Come here for a second. Sure.

415
00:17:32,015 --> 00:17:33,214
Have you heard anything

416
00:17:33,216 --> 00:17:36,784
about any secret
office romances or...

417
00:17:36,786 --> 00:17:39,587
You tell me.

418
00:17:39,589 --> 00:17:42,090
Well, you do mean
you and Jim, right?

419
00:17:43,859 --> 00:17:46,361
Oh, God. I am so sorry.
I mean, I thought...

420
00:17:46,363 --> 00:17:48,329
You guys hang out all the time.

421
00:17:48,331 --> 00:17:49,664
And you're talking all the time.

422
00:17:49,666 --> 00:17:52,066
I'm sorry.
It's like...

423
00:17:52,068 --> 00:17:54,469
It's okay. It's okay.

424
00:17:55,971 --> 00:18:00,475
Ah! Not so fast,
fire guy.

425
00:18:02,111 --> 00:18:03,778
How do we get to Bernie's
Tavern from here?

426
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:05,279
Oh, don't worry.
We're all gonna carpool.

427
00:18:05,281 --> 00:18:06,848
So, Bernie's, huh?
We're all going to Bernie's?

428
00:18:06,850 --> 00:18:09,951
Oh, uh, sorry. We're not
going as a group.

429
00:18:09,953 --> 00:18:11,319
It's just a private friend

430
00:18:11,321 --> 00:18:12,954
who happens to know all
of us from different ways

431
00:18:12,956 --> 00:18:14,655
is throwing a private
birthday thing.

432
00:18:14,657 --> 00:18:16,157
Right, right, right.
Well, guys, I'd love to go

433
00:18:16,159 --> 00:18:17,358
to Bernie's with you.
But you know what?

434
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:18,493
I have an office party.

435
00:18:18,495 --> 00:18:19,761
Big office party
I need to go to.

436
00:18:19,763 --> 00:18:21,162
So can't get out of it.

437
00:18:21,164 --> 00:18:22,430
Good job.
Hey, see you later.

438
00:18:22,432 --> 00:18:25,299
Nice job, Bill. Not.

439
00:18:33,143 --> 00:18:36,744
Oh, hey, how's your new
side project going?

440
00:18:36,746 --> 00:18:38,913
Um, oh, yeah.
I gave that up.

441
00:18:38,915 --> 00:18:41,115
Really? Yeah. It
turns out I was, um,

442
00:18:41,117 --> 00:18:43,351
just grasping at straws.

443
00:18:43,353 --> 00:18:45,620
Just because two people
are hanging out,

444
00:18:45,622 --> 00:18:47,789
it doesn't mean
that they're together.

445
00:18:47,791 --> 00:18:50,858
You know? Like people
can just be friends.

446
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:52,660
And I think that it was
really unfair of us

447
00:18:52,662 --> 00:18:54,896
to assume that there was
anything else going on.

448
00:19:04,274 --> 00:19:07,775
Surprise!

449
00:19:07,777 --> 00:19:09,911
Everybody.

450
00:19:09,913 --> 00:19:12,947
Wow. Who opened the morgue
for this thing?

451
00:19:12,949 --> 00:19:14,515
I was just driving by.
Thought I'd drop in.

452
00:19:14,517 --> 00:19:16,617
Here's some wine.
I would love a glass

453
00:19:16,619 --> 00:19:17,685
if you're gonna open it.

454
00:19:17,687 --> 00:19:19,821
Hello, temp.
Take my jacket.

455
00:19:19,823 --> 00:19:21,589
Ha ha ha!

456
00:19:21,591 --> 00:19:23,758
Oh, come on. That guy?

457
00:19:25,461 --> 00:19:26,861
He is a good guy.
Not a terrorist.

458
00:19:26,863 --> 00:19:28,463
Yikes.

459
00:19:28,465 --> 00:19:29,730
Karaoke. I love it.

460
00:19:29,732 --> 00:19:33,201
I am a karaoke fiend!

461
00:19:33,203 --> 00:19:34,368
I call dibs.
I've got next.

462
00:19:34,370 --> 00:19:37,371
I got next up.
Come on. Let's...

463
00:19:39,476 --> 00:19:42,343
Ha! Okay.
Where's that wine?

464
00:19:42,345 --> 00:19:44,779
Okay. This is
a duet. So...

465
00:19:46,216 --> 00:19:48,816
Somebody else?
Pam, you want to...

466
00:19:48,818 --> 00:19:50,651
come up and sing this one?

467
00:19:50,653 --> 00:19:53,988
Need somebody else.
Takers, please.

468
00:19:58,361 --> 00:19:59,594
Kelly?

469
00:20:09,038 --> 00:20:13,007
This is the part
that goes to the girl.

470
00:20:48,811 --> 00:20:50,178
We're making love!

471
00:21:01,858 --> 00:21:03,591
Talk! Just talk!

472
00:21:03,593 --> 00:21:04,926
I am...
Shut up!

473
00:21:04,928 --> 00:21:07,261
Funny story... The way
I got into improv

474
00:21:07,263 --> 00:21:09,430
was... I got into improv...

475
00:21:09,432 --> 00:21:11,766
The story about me
getting into improv was

476
00:21:11,768 --> 00:21:13,734
that I was walking
down the street

477
00:21:13,736 --> 00:21:15,303
and a race car pulls up.

478
00:21:15,305 --> 00:21:17,538
And the guy says,
"Hey, you're funny.

479
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:19,106
"You're the funniest guy
I've ever seen.

480
00:21:19,108 --> 00:21:21,209
Or my name is not
Dale Earnhardt."

481
00:21:23,813 --> 00:21:25,313
And that was an improv.

482
00:21:27,182 --> 00:21:30,451
Um, the real way was that
I found a flyer.
