1
00:00:02,472 --> 00:00:03,605
Hey.

2
00:00:03,607 --> 00:00:05,374
Hello.

3
00:00:05,376 --> 00:00:06,642
Jim!

4
00:00:06,644 --> 00:00:08,210
- What's up, buddy?
- This is not funny.

5
00:00:08,212 --> 00:00:09,378
Why is my stuff in here?

6
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:10,746
Wow, that's weird.

7
00:00:10,748 --> 00:00:12,581
Ooh, dollar for a stapler,
that's pretty good.

8
00:00:12,583 --> 00:00:14,850
Yeah, well I'm not paying
for my own stuff, okay?

9
00:00:14,852 --> 00:00:16,118
I know you did this
'cause you're friends

10
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:17,419
with the, uh,
vending machine guy.

11
00:00:17,421 --> 00:00:18,420
Who Steve?

12
00:00:18,422 --> 00:00:19,621
- Yeah, Steve.
- Oh, sorry.

13
00:00:19,623 --> 00:00:22,558
- Or whatever his name is.
- What do I want?

14
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:24,760
Ooh, it's a pencil cup.

15
00:00:24,762 --> 00:00:26,795
Oh, no, no, no, no.

16
00:00:26,797 --> 00:00:28,197
That's my pencil cup.

17
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:30,332
Um, I don't think so,
I just bought it.

18
00:00:30,334 --> 00:00:33,569
Uh, I think so, and you're
going to hand it over to me.

19
00:00:33,571 --> 00:00:35,838
I love these.

20
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,206
Okay, fine.

21
00:00:38,274 --> 00:00:40,175
My wallet?

22
00:00:40,177 --> 00:00:41,176
Um.

23
00:00:41,178 --> 00:00:43,178
Oh, there it is. J1.

24
00:00:44,714 --> 00:00:46,215
- Here, you know what?
- I don't have any...

25
00:00:46,217 --> 00:00:47,750
You can have some nickels.

26
00:00:51,788 --> 00:00:55,057
5, 10.

27
00:00:55,059 --> 00:00:58,560
15, 20, 25...

28
00:01:31,828 --> 00:01:33,495
Hello, everyone.

29
00:01:33,497 --> 00:01:34,530
Morning, Michael.

30
00:01:34,532 --> 00:01:36,165
Where are we going
this afternoon?

31
00:01:36,167 --> 00:01:37,266
Nah, ha, ha.

32
00:01:37,268 --> 00:01:39,301
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

33
00:01:39,303 --> 00:01:42,771
Last week, Michael sent out
this mysterious memo.

34
00:01:42,773 --> 00:01:45,174
"It's time for our first
quarter camaraderie event.

35
00:01:45,176 --> 00:01:47,509
"So pack a swimsuit,
a toothbrush,

36
00:01:47,511 --> 00:01:49,378
"rubber-soled shoes,

37
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:50,512
and a ski mask."

38
00:01:50,514 --> 00:01:52,681
A ski mask and a swimsuit?

39
00:01:52,683 --> 00:01:55,818
So that he can
have us rob a bank

40
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:58,120
and then escape
through the sewers.

41
00:01:58,122 --> 00:02:00,089
And brush our teeth.

42
00:02:01,591 --> 00:02:02,724
Yeah?

43
00:02:02,726 --> 00:02:04,193
Michael.

44
00:02:04,195 --> 00:02:06,061
Stanley... bo banley.

45
00:02:06,063 --> 00:02:07,062
I need to know...

46
00:02:07,064 --> 00:02:08,263
Banana fanna fo fanley.

47
00:02:08,265 --> 00:02:09,598
- What we're doing.
- Me mi mo manley.

48
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:10,599
You said bring a toothbrush.

49
00:02:10,601 --> 00:02:11,600
Stanley.

50
00:02:11,602 --> 00:02:13,469
Is this an overnight?

51
00:02:13,471 --> 00:02:18,440
Maybe. The suspense is just
so exciting, isn't it?

52
00:02:18,442 --> 00:02:20,509
Should my wife tell her boss
she's not coming in tomorrow?

53
00:02:20,511 --> 00:02:22,244
Maybe, I don't know.

54
00:02:22,246 --> 00:02:23,579
Not maybe, yes or no.

55
00:02:23,581 --> 00:02:26,515
Well, no, but... okay,
don't spoil it for everybody.

56
00:02:26,517 --> 00:02:27,549
All right?

57
00:02:27,551 --> 00:02:32,054
But, we are going
on a booze cruise

58
00:02:32,056 --> 00:02:34,556
on Lake Wallempaupack.

59
00:02:35,692 --> 00:02:37,793
In January.

60
00:02:37,795 --> 00:02:39,995
It's cheaper.

61
00:02:39,997 --> 00:02:41,430
This is not just another party.

62
00:02:41,432 --> 00:02:44,366
This is a leadership
training exercise.

63
00:02:44,368 --> 00:02:45,767
Right?

64
00:02:45,769 --> 00:02:49,271
I'm going to combine elements
of fun and motivation

65
00:02:49,273 --> 00:02:53,675
and education into a single,
mind-blowing experience.

66
00:02:53,677 --> 00:02:55,978
It is now time to unveil

67
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:58,647
the destination of
this year's retreat.

68
00:02:58,649 --> 00:03:02,251
We are going on a harbor cruise

69
00:03:02,253 --> 00:03:04,520
of Lake Wallempaupack.

70
00:03:09,959 --> 00:03:11,293
It's a booze cruise.

71
00:03:11,295 --> 00:03:13,061
All right.

72
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:16,665
I have a test for business
school tomorrow night.

73
00:03:16,667 --> 00:03:19,368
Is it okay if skip the cruise
and study for that?

74
00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:21,236
No, this is mandatory.

75
00:03:21,238 --> 00:03:22,371
But don't worry, you know what?

76
00:03:22,373 --> 00:03:23,605
You're going to learn plenty.

77
00:03:23,607 --> 00:03:27,342
This is going to turn
your life around, Ryan.

78
00:03:27,344 --> 00:03:28,677
I'm already in business school.

79
00:03:28,679 --> 00:03:29,978
Wait, Michael?

80
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:31,180
Yeah?

81
00:03:31,182 --> 00:03:32,948
Um, why did you tell us
to bring a bathing suit?

82
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:34,950
To throw you off the scent.

83
00:03:34,952 --> 00:03:36,585
Yeah, but I bought
a bathing suit.

84
00:03:36,587 --> 00:03:38,887
Well, just keep the tags on
and you can return it.

85
00:03:38,889 --> 00:03:40,856
I took the tags off already.

86
00:03:40,858 --> 00:03:42,191
Well, that's not my fault, okay?

87
00:03:42,193 --> 00:03:43,926
Just... we're not going
to pay for a bathing suit.

88
00:03:43,928 --> 00:03:45,060
Okay.

89
00:03:45,062 --> 00:03:46,195
I know what you're all thinking.

90
00:03:46,197 --> 00:03:47,963
Who is this smart little cookie?

91
00:03:47,965 --> 00:03:49,965
Her name is Brenda...

92
00:03:49,967 --> 00:03:52,067
something, and she
is from corporate.

93
00:03:52,069 --> 00:03:55,370
And she is here, like you, to
learn from what I have to say.

94
00:03:55,372 --> 00:03:56,972
I am a great
motivational speaker.

95
00:03:56,974 --> 00:04:01,643
I attended a Tony Robbins event
by the airport last year, and...

96
00:04:01,645 --> 00:04:03,979
It wasn't the actual course.

97
00:04:03,981 --> 00:04:05,681
You have to pay
for the actual course.

98
00:04:05,683 --> 00:04:10,085
But, it talked about
the actual course.

99
00:04:10,087 --> 00:04:12,821
And I've incorporated

100
00:04:12,823 --> 00:04:16,225
a lot of his ideas
into my own course.

101
00:04:16,227 --> 00:04:19,461
Leader... ship.

102
00:04:19,463 --> 00:04:24,433
The word ship is hidden inside
the word leadership,

103
00:04:24,435 --> 00:04:27,202
as its derivation.

104
00:04:27,204 --> 00:04:32,007
So, if this office
is in fact a ship,

105
00:04:32,009 --> 00:04:33,809
as its leader...

106
00:04:33,811 --> 00:04:35,777
I am the captain.

107
00:04:35,779 --> 00:04:36,945
But...

108
00:04:36,947 --> 00:04:39,147
We're all in the same boat.

109
00:04:39,149 --> 00:04:40,949
Teamwork.

110
00:04:40,951 --> 00:04:44,786
Last year, Michael's theme was
"bowl over the competition."

111
00:04:44,788 --> 00:04:48,323
So, guess where we went?

112
00:04:48,325 --> 00:04:52,194
Now, on this ship
that is the office,

113
00:04:52,196 --> 00:04:54,663
what is the sales department?

114
00:04:54,665 --> 00:04:57,332
Anyone?

115
00:04:57,334 --> 00:04:59,901
How about the sales department
is the sails?

116
00:04:59,903 --> 00:05:01,069
Yes, Daryl.

117
00:05:01,071 --> 00:05:02,938
The sales department
makes sales.

118
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:03,939
Good.

119
00:05:03,941 --> 00:05:04,940
Let me just explain.

120
00:05:04,942 --> 00:05:07,109
I see the sales department

121
00:05:07,111 --> 00:05:08,744
as the furnace.

122
00:05:08,746 --> 00:05:10,879
- A furnace?
- Yeah.

123
00:05:10,881 --> 00:05:12,114
Yeesh, how old is this ship?

124
00:05:12,116 --> 00:05:13,649
How about the anchor?

125
00:05:13,651 --> 00:05:15,050
What does the furnace do?

126
00:05:15,052 --> 00:05:16,985
All right, let's not get
hung up on the furnace.

127
00:05:16,987 --> 00:05:18,287
This just...

128
00:05:18,289 --> 00:05:19,454
It's the sales...

129
00:05:19,456 --> 00:05:20,555
I see the sales department
are down there.

130
00:05:20,557 --> 00:05:21,890
They're in the engine room

131
00:05:21,892 --> 00:05:24,826
and they are shoveling
coal into the furnace, right?

132
00:05:24,828 --> 00:05:26,161
I mean who saw
the movie Titanic?

133
00:05:26,163 --> 00:05:28,096
They were very important
in the movie Titanic.

134
00:05:28,098 --> 00:05:29,731
Who saw it?
Show of hands.

135
00:05:29,733 --> 00:05:31,833
Not really sure what movie
you're talking about.

136
00:05:31,835 --> 00:05:32,868
You sure you got
the title right?

137
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:34,202
Titanic.

138
00:05:34,204 --> 00:05:36,305
I think you're thinking of
The Hunt for Red October.

139
00:05:36,307 --> 00:05:37,306
No, I'm...

140
00:05:37,308 --> 00:05:39,074
Leo DiCaprio, come on!

141
00:05:39,076 --> 00:05:40,609
Michael stands in
the front of the boat

142
00:05:40,611 --> 00:05:43,345
and says that he's king of
the world within the first hour,

143
00:05:43,347 --> 00:05:45,914
or I give you my next paycheck.

144
00:05:45,916 --> 00:05:48,550
Michael, everyone in
the engine room drowned.

145
00:05:48,552 --> 00:05:51,486
No... thank you,
spoiler alert.

146
00:05:51,488 --> 00:05:53,455
You saw the movie,
those of you who did.

147
00:05:54,992 --> 00:05:57,192
They're happy down there
in the furnace room.

148
00:05:57,194 --> 00:05:58,727
And they're dirty and grimy

149
00:05:58,729 --> 00:05:59,895
and sweaty.

150
00:05:59,897 --> 00:06:02,831
And they're singing
their ethnic songs.

151
00:06:02,833 --> 00:06:06,368
And... actually,
that might be Warehouse.

152
00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:08,003
What?

153
00:06:08,005 --> 00:06:09,471
The... no...

154
00:06:09,473 --> 00:06:11,206
No, I didn't...

155
00:06:11,208 --> 00:06:12,574
Okay, well, the...

156
00:06:12,576 --> 00:06:16,144
Okay, in a nutshell what I'm
saying is leadership.

157
00:06:16,146 --> 00:06:19,181
We'll get... we'll talk more
about that on the boat.

158
00:06:19,183 --> 00:06:20,949
Aye, aye, Captain.

159
00:06:25,155 --> 00:06:27,222
Pam, you are Mary Ann.

160
00:06:27,224 --> 00:06:28,357
We have...

161
00:06:28,359 --> 00:06:29,791
The Professor and Ginger.

162
00:06:29,793 --> 00:06:31,226
Welcome aboard.

163
00:06:31,228 --> 00:06:33,362
Angela, you are Mrs. Howell.

164
00:06:33,364 --> 00:06:34,363
Lovey.

165
00:06:34,365 --> 00:06:35,564
Uh, the native.

166
00:06:35,566 --> 00:06:36,631
Sometimes they come
from neighboring...

167
00:06:36,633 --> 00:06:38,667
Oh, uh, we have, uh...

168
00:06:38,669 --> 00:06:40,669
one of the Globetrotters.

169
00:06:40,671 --> 00:06:41,670
I am the Skipper.

170
00:06:41,672 --> 00:06:43,905
And Dwight,
you will be Gilligan.

171
00:06:43,907 --> 00:06:45,273
Cool.

172
00:06:45,275 --> 00:06:46,274
Actually, I'm the Skipper.

173
00:06:46,276 --> 00:06:48,009
Okay. But you could be Gilligan.

174
00:06:48,011 --> 00:06:49,010
Oh, I'd rather die.

175
00:06:49,012 --> 00:06:50,045
Hi.
I am Michael Scott.

176
00:06:50,047 --> 00:06:51,713
I am the Captain of this party.

177
00:06:51,715 --> 00:06:52,981
I'm Captain Jack.

178
00:06:52,983 --> 00:06:54,583
- I'm captain of the ship.
- Ahh!

179
00:06:54,585 --> 00:06:56,318
I'm also captain of anyone
who sets foot on the ship.

180
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:57,386
Hi, welcome aboard.

181
00:06:58,287 --> 00:06:59,421
Okay.

182
00:06:59,423 --> 00:07:01,390
In an office,
when you are ranking people,

183
00:07:01,392 --> 00:07:03,792
manager is higher than captain.

184
00:07:03,794 --> 00:07:06,328
On a boat, who knows?

185
00:07:06,330 --> 00:07:08,597
It's nebul-ose.

186
00:07:08,599 --> 00:07:10,232
Hey, look.

187
00:07:10,234 --> 00:07:12,667
I'm king of the world!

188
00:07:12,669 --> 00:07:16,505
Woo!

189
00:07:16,507 --> 00:07:20,208
Woo!

190
00:07:21,377 --> 00:07:22,911
Okay, all right.

191
00:07:22,913 --> 00:07:24,212
Welcome aboard.

192
00:07:24,214 --> 00:07:26,681
I am your captain, Captain Jack.

193
00:07:26,683 --> 00:07:29,351
And I am the Regional Manager
of Dunder Mifflin,

194
00:07:29,353 --> 00:07:30,986
Michael Scott.

195
00:07:30,988 --> 00:07:33,021
Welcome, welcome.

196
00:07:33,023 --> 00:07:34,022
- Okay, so, um...
- Okay, so.

197
00:07:34,024 --> 00:07:36,091
Please... the, uh,
life preservers.

198
00:07:36,093 --> 00:07:37,826
They are located

199
00:07:37,828 --> 00:07:39,227
underneath the seats
all along the perimeter

200
00:07:39,229 --> 00:07:40,562
But don't worry.
of the boat.

201
00:07:40,564 --> 00:07:41,763
You are not going to be needing
life preservers tonight.

202
00:07:41,765 --> 00:07:42,998
- Well, we might be, okay?
- This is just gonna be...

203
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,833
- Please let me finish, okay?
- Well...

204
00:07:44,835 --> 00:07:46,067
Thank you.

205
00:07:46,069 --> 00:07:47,436
So the Coast Guard requires

206
00:07:47,438 --> 00:07:49,738
that I tell you where
the safety exits are.

207
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:50,972
Now, on this ship,
it's very easy.

208
00:07:50,974 --> 00:07:54,776
Anywhere over the side.

209
00:07:54,778 --> 00:07:55,811
Not only am I
your ship's captain,

210
00:07:55,813 --> 00:07:57,412
I am also your party captain!

211
00:07:57,414 --> 00:07:59,181
Woo, we're going to get it going
here in just a few minutes...

212
00:07:59,183 --> 00:08:01,216
And I am your party captain too!

213
00:08:01,218 --> 00:08:03,285
And you are going to put
on your dancing shoes

214
00:08:03,287 --> 00:08:04,619
later on.
Hey, Mike, Mike.

215
00:08:04,621 --> 00:08:06,021
So, we are gonna...

216
00:08:06,023 --> 00:08:08,423
- Uh, if you don't mind.
- Rock it... what?

217
00:08:08,425 --> 00:08:10,525
Please, okay?

218
00:08:10,527 --> 00:08:13,161
If the boat's a-rocking,
don't come knocking.

219
00:08:13,163 --> 00:08:14,162
Michael!
Yup.

220
00:08:14,164 --> 00:08:15,730
Uh, your company employees

221
00:08:15,732 --> 00:08:17,466
are not the only people
on the boat tonight, okay?

222
00:08:17,468 --> 00:08:18,533
We're all gonna have
a good time tonight.

223
00:08:18,535 --> 00:08:20,669
Hey, hey, listen, Mike.

224
00:08:20,671 --> 00:08:22,471
Why don't you let me
and my crew do our job?

225
00:08:22,473 --> 00:08:23,605
You just sit back...
Mm-hmm.

226
00:08:23,607 --> 00:08:25,540
And have a good time, okay?
Okay, yup.

227
00:08:25,542 --> 00:08:26,975
All right?

228
00:08:26,977 --> 00:08:28,076
You guys,

229
00:08:28,078 --> 00:08:29,411
it's like we're in high school

230
00:08:29,413 --> 00:08:30,545
and we're at the cool table.

231
00:08:30,547 --> 00:08:32,113
Right?

232
00:08:32,115 --> 00:08:33,348
Yeah.

233
00:08:33,350 --> 00:08:34,716
Kim, were you a cheerleader?

234
00:08:34,718 --> 00:08:38,253
No, she was total little Miss
Artsy Fartsy in high school.

235
00:08:38,255 --> 00:08:40,288
She wore the turtleneck
and everything.

236
00:08:40,290 --> 00:08:42,224
That's hilarious.

237
00:08:42,226 --> 00:08:43,758
It's not hilarious, but...

238
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:44,926
Where'd you go to school?

239
00:08:44,928 --> 00:08:46,261
Fisher Bohara.

240
00:08:46,263 --> 00:08:47,996
"Piss la poo
cares-uh?"

241
00:08:47,998 --> 00:08:49,898
We played you.

242
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:52,300
You... you really
look familiar.

243
00:08:52,302 --> 00:08:54,402
Did you, uh... You cheered
for them, didn't you?

244
00:08:54,404 --> 00:08:56,304
Mm, no.

245
00:08:56,306 --> 00:08:58,240
Yes, I did.

246
00:09:09,987 --> 00:09:11,486
- Having fun?
- Yeah.

247
00:09:11,488 --> 00:09:13,922
Everybody's really nice.

248
00:09:13,924 --> 00:09:17,626
Good, well, that is what
Scranton is all about.

249
00:09:17,628 --> 00:09:19,694
Not like you "New Yawkers."

250
00:09:19,696 --> 00:09:20,829
When are you going
to start the, uh...

251
00:09:20,831 --> 00:09:22,397
What?
The, uh, presentation?

252
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:24,232
Well, I already sort of
started it back at the office

253
00:09:24,234 --> 00:09:26,234
and on the dock with
the Gilligan thing.

254
00:09:26,236 --> 00:09:28,703
So, right now, I was thinking.

255
00:09:28,705 --> 00:09:29,704
Yes.

256
00:09:29,706 --> 00:09:30,772
Okay!

257
00:09:30,774 --> 00:09:32,107
Listen up,

258
00:09:32,109 --> 00:09:33,775
all you, Dunder Mifflinites!

259
00:09:33,777 --> 00:09:35,110
I would like to talk

260
00:09:35,112 --> 00:09:36,945
to you all about

261
00:09:36,947 --> 00:09:38,647
life preservers.

262
00:09:38,649 --> 00:09:41,449
Now, one important
life preserver

263
00:09:41,451 --> 00:09:43,618
in business is IT Support.

264
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:46,454
Not now Mike,
we're doing the limbo!

265
00:09:46,456 --> 00:09:48,423
That's right, partiers.

266
00:09:48,425 --> 00:09:50,091
It's time to limbo,
limbo, limbo.

267
00:09:50,093 --> 00:09:52,193
So, okay.
All right!

268
00:09:52,195 --> 00:09:53,261
I need a volunteer

269
00:09:53,263 --> 00:09:54,963
to come up here
and hold my stick.

270
00:09:54,965 --> 00:09:56,197
Huh, who's it gonna be?

271
00:09:56,199 --> 00:09:57,699
Me.
Me, me, me.

272
00:09:57,701 --> 00:09:58,700
Me, me, me.

273
00:09:58,702 --> 00:10:00,135
Uh.

274
00:10:00,137 --> 00:10:02,037
Usually, it's a woman.

275
00:10:02,039 --> 00:10:03,672
I'm stronger.

276
00:10:03,674 --> 00:10:04,773
Hey, I got an idea.

277
00:10:04,775 --> 00:10:07,676
How would you like
to steer the ship, Dwight?

278
00:10:07,678 --> 00:10:08,877
Keep us on a steady course.

279
00:10:08,879 --> 00:10:11,346
Keep a sharp eye out,
I'm counting on you.

280
00:10:11,348 --> 00:10:13,782
I was the youngest pilot
in Pan Am history.

281
00:10:13,784 --> 00:10:17,152
When I was four, the pilot
let me ride in the cockpit

282
00:10:17,154 --> 00:10:20,055
and fly the plane with him.

283
00:10:20,057 --> 00:10:22,557
And I was four and I was great!

284
00:10:22,559 --> 00:10:23,692
And I would have landed it,

285
00:10:23,694 --> 00:10:26,127
but my dad wanted us
to go back to our seats.

286
00:10:29,633 --> 00:10:31,132
All right, all right.

287
00:10:31,134 --> 00:10:34,369
That was great, now it's time
for the dance contest!

288
00:10:34,371 --> 00:10:36,972
Why don't we do that after
I do my presentation and...

289
00:10:36,974 --> 00:10:38,006
Nope.

290
00:10:38,008 --> 00:10:39,474
Dance contest!

291
00:10:39,476 --> 00:10:42,177
All right, we'll have a
motivational dance contest.

292
00:10:42,179 --> 00:10:43,812
Hit it!

293
00:10:43,814 --> 00:10:46,181
Yeah, okay.

294
00:10:46,183 --> 00:10:47,349
Dancing.

295
00:10:47,351 --> 00:10:52,187
It is a primal art form
used in ancient times

296
00:10:52,189 --> 00:10:57,993
to express yourself
with the body.

297
00:10:57,995 --> 00:10:59,794
And communicate.

298
00:11:09,739 --> 00:11:12,674
Sometimes you have
to take a break

299
00:11:12,676 --> 00:11:13,942
from being the kind of boss

300
00:11:13,944 --> 00:11:15,810
that's always trying
to teach people things.

301
00:11:15,812 --> 00:11:19,347
Sometimes you have to just
to be the boss of dancing.

302
00:11:44,974 --> 00:11:47,342
Hey, come inside and talk to me.

303
00:11:47,344 --> 00:11:48,677
I can't.

304
00:11:48,679 --> 00:11:51,279
Do you want us
to run aground, woman?

305
00:11:52,815 --> 00:11:55,917
Snorkel shots, snorkel shots!

306
00:11:55,919 --> 00:11:58,653
Snorkel shots, snorkel shots!

307
00:11:58,655 --> 00:12:00,021
Snorkel shots!

308
00:12:01,358 --> 00:12:03,558
Woo! Who's next?

309
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:04,693
Come on, Pammy,
come on, come on!

310
00:12:04,695 --> 00:12:05,760
No, I'm not doing that.

311
00:12:05,762 --> 00:12:06,761
Come on!

312
00:12:06,763 --> 00:12:08,096
Ay ay ay ay ay!

313
00:12:08,098 --> 00:12:09,097
Tequila!

314
00:12:09,099 --> 00:12:10,398
Woo!
Oy!

315
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:11,566
That's what I'm talking about.

316
00:12:11,568 --> 00:12:12,567
Hey, why don't we find,

317
00:12:12,569 --> 00:12:14,202
like, a quieter place
to hang out?

318
00:12:14,204 --> 00:12:16,571
You know what, I've just got to
wait for Daryl to do his shot.

319
00:12:16,573 --> 00:12:17,572
Just a minute.

320
00:12:17,574 --> 00:12:19,841
Come on, Daryl, Daryl!

321
00:12:19,843 --> 00:12:21,609
It's getting kind of
rowdy down there.

322
00:12:21,611 --> 00:12:22,711
Yeah.

323
00:12:22,713 --> 00:12:28,316
"Daryl, Daryl, Daryl."

324
00:12:28,318 --> 00:12:30,852
Sometimes I just don't get Roy.

325
00:12:31,954 --> 00:12:33,054
Well.

326
00:12:36,292 --> 00:12:38,193
I mean, I don't know.

327
00:12:47,002 --> 00:12:48,636
So.

328
00:12:48,638 --> 00:12:51,272
What's it like dating
a cheerleader?

329
00:12:53,976 --> 00:12:57,812
Oh... um.

330
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:20,135
I'm cold.

331
00:13:30,646 --> 00:13:32,947
So, what's this presentation
all about?

332
00:13:32,949 --> 00:13:35,083
Ah, see, this is
of general interest.

333
00:13:35,085 --> 00:13:38,253
It is about... priorities.

334
00:13:38,255 --> 00:13:40,121
And making decisions

335
00:13:40,123 --> 00:13:41,523
using the boat as an analogy.

336
00:13:41,525 --> 00:13:42,991
What is important to you?

337
00:13:42,993 --> 00:13:45,794
If the boat is sinking,
what do you save?

338
00:13:45,796 --> 00:13:47,095
Women and children.

339
00:13:47,097 --> 00:13:48,263
No, no.

340
00:13:48,265 --> 00:13:50,465
Salesmen and profit centers.

341
00:13:50,467 --> 00:13:52,133
That's a stupid analogy.

342
00:13:52,135 --> 00:13:54,736
Oh-kay,
well, obviously,

343
00:13:54,738 --> 00:13:57,505
you don't know anything
about leadership.

344
00:13:57,507 --> 00:14:00,475
Well, I was the captain of a
PC-1 Cyclone Coastal Patrol Boat

345
00:14:00,477 --> 00:14:02,410
during Desert Storm.

346
00:14:02,412 --> 00:14:04,879
Wow, you should be
the motivational speaker.

347
00:14:04,881 --> 00:14:06,648
Him, oh-kay.

348
00:14:06,650 --> 00:14:09,551
Yeah, he gives me
real responsibility, Michael.

349
00:14:09,553 --> 00:14:10,952
Captain Jack delegates.

350
00:14:10,954 --> 00:14:13,588
He's let me steer the ship
for the last hour.

351
00:14:15,624 --> 00:14:16,825
I'd like to be engaged.

352
00:14:16,827 --> 00:14:19,627
How did you manage
to pull that off?

353
00:14:19,629 --> 00:14:21,563
Um.

354
00:14:21,565 --> 00:14:23,965
Uh, I've been engaged
for three years

355
00:14:23,967 --> 00:14:25,967
and there's no end in sight.

356
00:14:25,969 --> 00:14:29,137
So, you don't want
to ask my advice.

357
00:14:29,139 --> 00:14:31,172
Suppose your office
building's on fire.

358
00:14:31,174 --> 00:14:32,173
Jim.

359
00:14:32,175 --> 00:14:33,341
Who would you save?

360
00:14:33,343 --> 00:14:37,579
Um... let's see, uh...

361
00:14:39,782 --> 00:14:40,915
The customer.

362
00:14:40,917 --> 00:14:42,450
'Cause the customer is king.

363
00:14:42,452 --> 00:14:43,918
Not what I was looking for,
but a good thought.

364
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:45,920
He's just sucking up.

365
00:14:45,922 --> 00:14:47,255
When you were in the Navy,

366
00:14:47,257 --> 00:14:49,691
did you, um, ever almost die?

367
00:14:49,693 --> 00:14:51,192
Oh yeah, oh yeah.

368
00:14:51,194 --> 00:14:52,193
And I wasn't thinking about

369
00:14:52,195 --> 00:14:53,228
some customer.

370
00:14:53,230 --> 00:14:55,330
I was thinking about
my first wife.

371
00:14:55,332 --> 00:14:58,199
The day I got back
on shore, I married her.

372
00:15:02,271 --> 00:15:05,173
You know what, I would
save the receptionist.

373
00:15:05,175 --> 00:15:06,975
I just, wanted to clear that up.

374
00:15:10,512 --> 00:15:13,414
Hey, everybody,

375
00:15:13,416 --> 00:15:15,183
could I have your attention
for just a second?

376
00:15:15,185 --> 00:15:16,184
Would you listen
to me for a second?

377
00:15:16,186 --> 00:15:17,685
Um, we were up at the front

378
00:15:17,687 --> 00:15:19,721
and we were talking about
what's really important and...

379
00:15:19,723 --> 00:15:22,790
Pam, um...

380
00:15:22,792 --> 00:15:24,125
I think enough is enough.

381
00:15:24,127 --> 00:15:26,427
I think we should set
a date for our wedding.

382
00:15:26,429 --> 00:15:27,962
How about June 10th?

383
00:15:27,964 --> 00:15:29,264
- Woo!
- Come on, let's do it.

384
00:15:30,267 --> 00:15:32,967
- Finally.
- Come on, baby!

385
00:15:32,969 --> 00:15:34,269
Oh, my God, congratulations!

386
00:15:34,271 --> 00:15:36,638
Congratulations.

387
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:38,740
Yes!

388
00:15:38,742 --> 00:15:39,774
Oh, my God!

389
00:15:39,776 --> 00:15:40,909
I love you, baby.
Come on!

390
00:15:40,911 --> 00:15:42,243
Woo, congratulations!

391
00:15:47,850 --> 00:15:50,685
You know what, I don't want
to take credit for this.

392
00:15:50,687 --> 00:15:53,154
But Roy and I were just
having a conversation

393
00:15:53,156 --> 00:15:58,126
about making commitments
and making choices, right?

394
00:15:58,128 --> 00:15:59,594
Did I motivate you?

395
00:15:59,596 --> 00:16:01,262
No, it was, it was Captain Jack.

396
00:16:01,264 --> 00:16:02,830
Well...
Captain Jack!

397
00:16:02,832 --> 00:16:05,199
Could have been either one of us

398
00:16:05,201 --> 00:16:07,135
because, pretty much,
we were saying the same thing.

399
00:16:07,137 --> 00:16:09,237
Congratulations, that is great.

400
00:16:09,239 --> 00:16:10,939
We gotta celebrate!

401
00:16:13,376 --> 00:16:16,110
Hey, hey, hey, hey,
I got an idea, I got an idea.

402
00:16:16,112 --> 00:16:19,080
I can marry you right now
as captain of the ship, huh?

403
00:16:19,082 --> 00:16:22,850
Yes, I can marry you as Regional
Manager of Dunder Mifflin!

404
00:16:22,852 --> 00:16:25,486
No, no, no, no, I want
my mom and dad to be there.

405
00:16:25,488 --> 00:16:27,221
Then, I'll give you away!

406
00:16:27,223 --> 00:16:29,257
No, thank you.

407
00:16:34,863 --> 00:16:37,498
Do you think that'll ever be us?

408
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:38,700
No.

409
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:41,069
What is wrong with you?

410
00:16:41,071 --> 00:16:43,771
Why did you even
bring me here tonight?

411
00:16:43,773 --> 00:16:45,206
I don't know.

412
00:16:45,208 --> 00:16:47,108
Let's break up.

413
00:16:47,643 --> 00:16:49,577
Wh-what?

414
00:16:49,579 --> 00:16:52,580
This is where old
Captain Jack drives the boat.

415
00:16:52,582 --> 00:16:55,416
Wow.

416
00:16:55,418 --> 00:16:56,718
Seasick?

417
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:59,153
Captain Jack says
you should look at the moon.

418
00:16:59,155 --> 00:17:00,688
Captain Jack's a fart face.

419
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:07,028
I'm on medication.

420
00:17:07,030 --> 00:17:08,429
Really, what?

421
00:17:08,431 --> 00:17:09,831
Vomicillin.

422
00:17:12,369 --> 00:17:15,737
Okay, all right,
it's time to be bossy.

423
00:17:15,739 --> 00:17:17,939
Time to motivate,
let's blow some minds here.

424
00:17:17,941 --> 00:17:20,041
Okay, guys, guys, guys, cool it.

425
00:17:20,043 --> 00:17:21,142
Everybody.

426
00:17:21,144 --> 00:17:22,610
Dunder Mifflin
and Scranton employees.

427
00:17:22,612 --> 00:17:24,312
Brenda.

428
00:17:24,314 --> 00:17:26,781
I have some very, very urgent
news I need to tell everybody.

429
00:17:26,783 --> 00:17:28,583
Right now, listen up.

430
00:17:28,585 --> 00:17:31,386
The ship... is sinking.

431
00:17:31,388 --> 00:17:32,653
Okay?

432
00:17:32,655 --> 00:17:34,622
We're going down, right now.

433
00:17:34,624 --> 00:17:37,625
Just wrap your heads around
the reality of that.

434
00:17:37,627 --> 00:17:39,460
What?

435
00:17:39,462 --> 00:17:40,661
Shh, please, everybody,
it's my turn now, okay?

436
00:17:40,663 --> 00:17:42,363
Captain Jack is gone.

437
00:17:42,365 --> 00:17:44,866
In five minutes,
this ship is going to be

438
00:17:44,868 --> 00:17:46,234
at the bottom of the lake.

439
00:17:46,236 --> 00:17:49,904
And there aren't enough spaces
on the lifeboats.

440
00:17:49,906 --> 00:17:51,739
Who are we going to save?

441
00:17:51,741 --> 00:17:53,474
- Do we save sales?
- No, no!

442
00:17:53,476 --> 00:17:55,510
Do we save customer service?

443
00:17:55,512 --> 00:17:57,045
Do we save accounting?

444
00:17:57,047 --> 00:17:59,380
This is a business
scenario, right?

445
00:17:59,382 --> 00:18:00,848
Hey, hey!

446
00:18:00,850 --> 00:18:02,116
It's a scary...

447
00:18:02,118 --> 00:18:03,684
- What the hell's going on here?
- It's a predicament.

448
00:18:03,686 --> 00:18:04,752
Get outta here, what the...

449
00:18:04,754 --> 00:18:06,320
And it's something that
each and every one of us

450
00:18:06,322 --> 00:18:07,889
have to think about.

451
00:18:07,891 --> 00:18:10,625
I'm in the brig, see?

452
00:18:10,627 --> 00:18:15,229
Boat size corporate friendly,
as advertised.

453
00:18:15,231 --> 00:18:16,931
What is the deal with
the guy jumping overboard?

454
00:18:16,933 --> 00:18:18,232
What was...

455
00:18:18,234 --> 00:18:21,903
If he had just waited
and heard what I had to say,

456
00:18:21,905 --> 00:18:24,705
he would be motivated
right now and not all wet.

457
00:18:39,288 --> 00:18:41,355
Somebody there?

458
00:18:43,425 --> 00:18:45,593
What happened to you?

459
00:18:46,796 --> 00:18:49,964
Captain Jack
has a problem with authority.

460
00:18:49,966 --> 00:18:53,601
Oh, right, 'cause you announced
that his ship was sinking?

461
00:18:53,603 --> 00:18:56,871
Yeah.
He just totally lost it.

462
00:18:56,873 --> 00:18:59,540
If you ask me,
he caused the panic.

463
00:19:03,912 --> 00:19:06,714
What a night.

464
00:19:06,716 --> 00:19:08,950
Well, it was nice for you.
Your friend got engaged.

465
00:19:08,952 --> 00:19:10,118
She was always engaged.

466
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:12,120
Roy said the first one
didn't count.

467
00:19:12,122 --> 00:19:15,423
That's... great.

468
00:19:17,659 --> 00:19:20,962
To tell you the truth, I...

469
00:19:20,964 --> 00:19:23,164
used to have
a big thing for Pam.

470
00:19:23,166 --> 00:19:24,599
So.

471
00:19:24,601 --> 00:19:26,367
Really, you're kidding me.

472
00:19:28,070 --> 00:19:30,338
Y-you and Pam?

473
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:32,707
Wow.

474
00:19:32,709 --> 00:19:35,076
I would have never...
put you two together.

475
00:19:35,078 --> 00:19:36,944
You really hid it well, God!

476
00:19:37,846 --> 00:19:40,248
I usually have a radar
for stuff like that.

477
00:19:43,485 --> 00:19:45,453
You know, I made out with Jan.

478
00:19:45,455 --> 00:19:47,455
Yeah, I know.
Yeah, yup.

479
00:19:47,457 --> 00:19:49,157
Well, Pam is cute.

480
00:19:49,159 --> 00:19:50,691
Yeah.

481
00:19:51,727 --> 00:19:53,794
She's really funny and...

482
00:19:53,796 --> 00:19:57,064
She's warm and she's just...

483
00:19:57,066 --> 00:19:59,800
Anyway.

484
00:19:59,802 --> 00:20:03,804
Well, if you like her so much,
uh, don't give up.

485
00:20:05,774 --> 00:20:07,875
She's engaged.

486
00:20:07,877 --> 00:20:08,876
Pfft... BFD!

487
00:20:08,878 --> 00:20:10,111
Engaged ain't married.

488
00:20:12,915 --> 00:20:15,249
Huh.

489
00:20:15,251 --> 00:20:17,585
Never, ever, ever give up.

490
00:20:23,325 --> 00:20:25,459
Don't worry, Michael.

491
00:20:25,461 --> 00:20:28,029
I'm taking us to shore!

492
00:20:28,031 --> 00:20:30,264
It's a fake wheel, dummy!
