1
00:00:01,284 --> 00:00:02,551
So Phil recruited me
to sell these cards,

2
00:00:02,553 --> 00:00:03,753
and now I am recruiting you.

3
00:00:03,755 --> 00:00:05,421
Who is this guy again?

4
00:00:05,423 --> 00:00:08,824
He drives a Corvette.
He is doing just fine.

5
00:00:08,826 --> 00:00:12,661
Okay, calling cards
are the wave of the future.

6
00:00:12,663 --> 00:00:14,063
These things sell themselves.

7
00:00:14,065 --> 00:00:15,931
Who uses calling cards anymore?

8
00:00:15,933 --> 00:00:17,733
You know what, that's a nice
attitude, Ryan.

9
00:00:17,735 --> 00:00:19,935
I'm just helping you invest
in your future, my friend.

10
00:00:19,937 --> 00:00:21,203
It sounds like
a get-rich-quick scheme.

11
00:00:21,205 --> 00:00:22,938
Yes. Thank you.
You will get rich quick.

12
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:24,440
We all will.

13
00:00:24,442 --> 00:00:26,108
Didn't you lose a lot of money

14
00:00:26,110 --> 00:00:28,644
on that other investment...
the one from the email?

15
00:00:28,646 --> 00:00:30,312
You know what, Toby,
when the son

16
00:00:30,314 --> 00:00:32,248
of the deposed king of Nigeria
emails you directly

17
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:34,817
asking for help, you help.

18
00:00:34,819 --> 00:00:37,353
His father ran the freaking
country, okay?

19
00:00:37,355 --> 00:00:39,321
All right.

20
00:00:39,323 --> 00:00:41,123
So raise your hand
if you want to get rich.

21
00:00:41,125 --> 00:00:43,959
All right.
No.

22
00:00:43,961 --> 00:00:46,729
Um, how is this not
a pyramid scheme?

23
00:00:46,731 --> 00:00:49,031
All right, let me explain again.

24
00:00:51,903 --> 00:00:54,770
Phil has recruited me
and another guy.

25
00:00:54,772 --> 00:00:57,273
Now we are getting
three people each.

26
00:00:57,275 --> 00:00:59,441
The more people
that get involved,

27
00:00:59,443 --> 00:01:00,676
the more people

28
00:01:00,678 --> 00:01:02,545
who are investing,

29
00:01:02,547 --> 00:01:04,313
and the more money
we're all gonna make.

30
00:01:04,315 --> 00:01:05,648
It's not a pyramid scheme.

31
00:01:05,650 --> 00:01:08,617
It's not even a scheme,
per se, it's...

32
00:01:16,193 --> 00:01:18,327
I have to go make a call.

33
00:01:58,802 --> 00:02:00,936
Happy birthday, Michael.
Oh ho ho.

34
00:02:00,938 --> 00:02:02,338
What?

35
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:03,606
I said happy birthday.

36
00:02:03,608 --> 00:02:05,708
Thank you.
That's really nice.

37
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:08,510
Today is my b-day
and people around here

38
00:02:08,512 --> 00:02:10,145
just go crazy for it.

39
00:02:10,147 --> 00:02:11,814
I don't know why.

40
00:02:11,816 --> 00:02:15,017
Oh, fun fact. I share
my birthday with Eva Longoria.

41
00:02:16,419 --> 00:02:18,621
So I have a perfect icebreaker

42
00:02:18,623 --> 00:02:21,056
if I ever meet Teri Hatcher.

43
00:02:21,058 --> 00:02:22,258
You excited?

44
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:23,359
Mm-hmm.

45
00:02:23,361 --> 00:02:24,493
Everybody freaking out?

46
00:02:24,495 --> 00:02:25,661
Mm-hmm.
Cool.

47
00:02:25,663 --> 00:02:27,663
Gonna be fun.
You're late.

48
00:02:27,665 --> 00:02:30,900
But I forgive you because
"doth it is my birthday."

49
00:02:30,902 --> 00:02:33,068
What's up?

50
00:02:35,672 --> 00:02:37,439
Oh, happy birthday.

51
00:02:37,441 --> 00:02:39,108
Ah, thank you, sir.

52
00:02:39,943 --> 00:02:42,244
Michael's birthday.

53
00:02:42,246 --> 00:02:43,746
It's pretty fun to watch,
actually.

54
00:02:43,748 --> 00:02:46,682
He gets very excited,
and then he eats a lot of cake.

55
00:02:46,684 --> 00:02:48,517
And then he runs around
the office.

56
00:02:48,519 --> 00:02:50,686
Then he has a sugar crash
in the afternoon.

57
00:02:50,688 --> 00:02:52,421
And then he falls asleep.

58
00:02:52,423 --> 00:02:55,491
And that's when we get
our work done.

59
00:03:01,264 --> 00:03:02,865
Did you hear anything yet?

60
00:03:02,867 --> 00:03:05,768
No. I'm still waiting.

61
00:03:08,105 --> 00:03:09,438
Yeah.
Yes.

62
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,040
There he is, the birthday boy.

63
00:03:11,042 --> 00:03:12,441
Oh, God.
Birthday hug.

64
00:03:12,443 --> 00:03:13,943
No, no, no. New suit.

65
00:03:13,945 --> 00:03:15,945
Please.
That suit is amazing.

66
00:03:15,947 --> 00:03:18,580
Thank you very much.
It is from Italy.

67
00:03:18,582 --> 00:03:21,150
Actually, no, Bulgaria.

68
00:03:21,152 --> 00:03:23,452
Maybe I should get one.

69
00:03:23,454 --> 00:03:25,721
Good luck.
One of a kind.

70
00:03:25,723 --> 00:03:28,057
EBay. Question.

71
00:03:28,059 --> 00:03:29,391
May I be in charge

72
00:03:29,393 --> 00:03:30,859
of the party planning
festivities?

73
00:03:30,861 --> 00:03:32,027
Not necessary.

74
00:03:32,029 --> 00:03:33,429
The party planning committee
is all over it.

75
00:03:33,431 --> 00:03:35,864
They've been working
24/7 all day yesterday.

76
00:03:35,866 --> 00:03:38,834
Excellent. On my part,
I did manage to reserve the...

77
00:03:38,836 --> 00:03:40,102
Don't. No. Please.

78
00:03:40,104 --> 00:03:41,804
Don't want to spoil it
for anybody.

79
00:03:41,806 --> 00:03:43,105
Spoil the surprise.

80
00:03:43,107 --> 00:03:44,773
Let's get the party started.

81
00:03:44,775 --> 00:03:46,041
Let's get the party started.

82
00:03:46,043 --> 00:03:47,443
Not the way I taught you.

83
00:03:51,816 --> 00:03:53,382
When should we
bring out the cake?

84
00:03:53,384 --> 00:03:54,683
1:00 or 1:30?

85
00:03:54,685 --> 00:03:57,586
1:00's good.
1:30.

86
00:03:58,521 --> 00:04:01,223
I'm sorry.
Are we boring you?

87
00:04:01,225 --> 00:04:03,058
Party planning committee,
listen up.

88
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:04,360
Michael would like trick candles

89
00:04:04,362 --> 00:04:06,028
for his birthday cake.

90
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:07,296
So make that a priority.

91
00:04:07,298 --> 00:04:08,430
Where do we get those?

92
00:04:08,432 --> 00:04:09,631
Not my problem.

93
00:04:09,633 --> 00:04:10,966
Here's a list of things

94
00:04:10,968 --> 00:04:14,370
that Michael would like
to be surprised by.

95
00:04:14,372 --> 00:04:16,071
Michael wants a strippergram?

96
00:04:16,073 --> 00:04:19,074
Yes, but he doesn't want
to know when or whom.

97
00:04:19,076 --> 00:04:20,376
No.

98
00:04:20,378 --> 00:04:22,678
This is a closed door meeting.

99
00:04:31,956 --> 00:04:33,489
Yeah.

100
00:04:33,491 --> 00:04:35,290
Michael, I have Jan on the line.

101
00:04:35,292 --> 00:04:36,925
Oh, great. Put her through.

102
00:04:36,927 --> 00:04:38,227
Hello, Michael.

103
00:04:38,229 --> 00:04:39,728
Hey, you.

104
00:04:39,730 --> 00:04:42,231
I'm returning your call.
You said it was urgent.

105
00:04:42,233 --> 00:04:43,732
It is urgent.

106
00:04:43,734 --> 00:04:45,234
I just wanted to call
and wish you a happy birthday.

107
00:04:45,236 --> 00:04:47,369
Well, today's
not my birthday, so.

108
00:04:47,371 --> 00:04:51,507
Really? 'Cause I thought
we had the same birthday.

109
00:04:53,143 --> 00:04:54,510
Happy birthday, Michael.

110
00:04:54,512 --> 00:04:55,711
Thanks.

111
00:04:56,613 --> 00:04:57,713
Am I on camera?

112
00:04:57,715 --> 00:05:01,116
Nope. Totally private.

113
00:05:01,118 --> 00:05:05,788
You can say whatever
is in your heart.

114
00:05:08,591 --> 00:05:11,160
You can take a five if you want.

115
00:05:29,245 --> 00:05:31,413
Somebody brought in donuts
for my birthday.

116
00:05:31,415 --> 00:05:33,148
Happy birthday.

117
00:05:33,150 --> 00:05:35,084
Thanks.

118
00:05:38,421 --> 00:05:40,089
Man, I'm so sorry.

119
00:05:40,091 --> 00:05:41,590
When do you find out?

120
00:05:41,592 --> 00:05:43,392
They said this afternoon.

121
00:05:43,394 --> 00:05:45,327
They're waiting on a second opinion.
Oh, okay.

122
00:05:45,329 --> 00:05:47,496
Second opinion on what?

123
00:05:47,498 --> 00:05:49,098
I might have skin cancer.

124
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:50,199
Oh, no.

125
00:05:50,201 --> 00:05:51,200
I was watching Grey's Anatomy,

126
00:05:51,202 --> 00:05:52,734
and there was a lifeguard on it.

127
00:05:52,736 --> 00:05:54,870
And he had skin cancer too.
Kelly, you know what...

128
00:05:54,872 --> 00:05:56,472
I never really thought
about death

129
00:05:56,474 --> 00:05:57,973
until Princess Diana died.

130
00:05:57,975 --> 00:06:00,409
That was the saddest
funeral ever.

131
00:06:02,145 --> 00:06:04,780
That and my sister's.

132
00:06:04,782 --> 00:06:06,181
Who brought in donuts?

133
00:06:06,183 --> 00:06:07,850
Somebody got donuts
for my birthday.

134
00:06:07,852 --> 00:06:09,585
Happy birthday.

135
00:06:09,587 --> 00:06:11,320
You didn't know
it was my birthday.

136
00:06:11,322 --> 00:06:12,721
I guess I forgot.

137
00:06:12,723 --> 00:06:14,923
Well, I guess I forgot
to give you a donut.

138
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:17,192
You serious?

139
00:06:27,770 --> 00:06:29,771
Skin cancer is treatable.

140
00:06:29,773 --> 00:06:31,440
Right.
It's gonna be okay.

141
00:06:31,442 --> 00:06:33,275
You don't know
it's going to be okay.

142
00:06:33,277 --> 00:06:35,043
Don't give him false hope.

143
00:06:38,214 --> 00:06:41,150
It's probably nothing though.

144
00:06:41,152 --> 00:06:43,418
Hi. Delivery
for Michael Scott.

145
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:45,087
Here we go.

146
00:06:45,089 --> 00:06:47,823
Okay, this is great.

147
00:06:47,825 --> 00:06:50,392
Thank you, my friends.
She is perfect.

148
00:06:50,394 --> 00:06:51,927
Uh.

149
00:06:51,929 --> 00:06:53,428
Dwight, may I have
your chair, please?

150
00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:55,764
And some singles, if you will.

151
00:06:55,766 --> 00:06:57,833
All right.

152
00:07:00,938 --> 00:07:02,204
Okay.

153
00:07:02,206 --> 00:07:03,839
Um...

154
00:07:03,841 --> 00:07:05,374
All right.
This has arms.

155
00:07:05,376 --> 00:07:07,309
Is that gonna be, uh...
Is that all right?

156
00:07:07,311 --> 00:07:09,978
Sure.

157
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:11,146
Okay.

158
00:07:12,448 --> 00:07:14,149
I'm so nervous.

159
00:07:15,685 --> 00:07:16,718
I can sign for it.

160
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,587
Oh, thanks.

161
00:07:20,156 --> 00:07:21,523
When I was seven,

162
00:07:21,525 --> 00:07:26,995
my mother hired a pony
and a cart

163
00:07:26,997 --> 00:07:29,097
to come to my house
for all the kids.

164
00:07:29,099 --> 00:07:33,268
And I got a really bad rash

165
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:34,937
from the pony.

166
00:07:34,939 --> 00:07:37,072
And all the kids
got to ride the pony.

167
00:07:37,074 --> 00:07:38,473
And I had to go inside.

168
00:07:38,475 --> 00:07:40,442
And my mother was rubbing
cream on me

169
00:07:40,444 --> 00:07:42,177
for probably three hours.

170
00:07:42,179 --> 00:07:44,012
And I never came outside.

171
00:07:44,014 --> 00:07:45,614
And by the time I got out,

172
00:07:45,616 --> 00:07:47,115
the pony was already
in the truck

173
00:07:47,117 --> 00:07:48,317
and around the corner.

174
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:51,119
So that was my worst birthday.

175
00:07:59,697 --> 00:08:02,698
Stop it. Stop!
What is that?

176
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:05,367
It's For The Longest Time
by William Joel.

177
00:08:05,369 --> 00:08:06,735
It's your favorite song.

178
00:08:06,737 --> 00:08:08,503
Yeah, when it's on the radio.

179
00:08:08,505 --> 00:08:10,272
My birthday blows.

180
00:08:10,274 --> 00:08:13,609
Nobody even signed
my birthday poster.

181
00:08:13,611 --> 00:08:15,811
Apparently my mother
is the only one

182
00:08:15,813 --> 00:08:18,380
who cares enough
to send me anything.

183
00:08:18,382 --> 00:08:20,015
I probably care more
than she does.

184
00:08:20,017 --> 00:08:21,583
You're making it worse.

185
00:08:23,052 --> 00:08:24,453
I bet Luke Perry's friends

186
00:08:24,455 --> 00:08:27,155
don't treat him like this.

187
00:08:27,157 --> 00:08:29,024
When does he hear?

188
00:08:29,026 --> 00:08:30,659
Sometime today.

189
00:08:30,661 --> 00:08:32,894
Poor Kevin.

190
00:08:32,896 --> 00:08:35,731
If I knew I had a week to live,

191
00:08:35,733 --> 00:08:39,434
I would probably go to Europe...

192
00:08:39,436 --> 00:08:41,270
and South America...

193
00:08:41,272 --> 00:08:43,438
and the Grand Canyon...

194
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,475
and I would want to see
the Pacific Ocean.

195
00:08:47,810 --> 00:08:50,212
It would be a pretty busy week.

196
00:08:50,214 --> 00:08:53,749
Uh, that's a list price
of $4.50.

197
00:08:53,751 --> 00:08:55,851
Unfortunately, this item
is on back order.

198
00:08:58,222 --> 00:08:59,655
Michael! Michael!

199
00:08:59,657 --> 00:09:01,056
Michael, Michael, Michael.

200
00:09:01,058 --> 00:09:02,391
Come here, come here, come here.

201
00:09:02,393 --> 00:09:04,426
Listen up, everyone.

202
00:09:04,428 --> 00:09:06,595
It is 11:23 exactly.

203
00:09:06,597 --> 00:09:08,130
The exact moment

204
00:09:08,132 --> 00:09:10,966
when you emerged from your
mother's vaginal canal.

205
00:09:10,968 --> 00:09:13,568
So, huh?

206
00:09:13,570 --> 00:09:15,704
Have a seat, please. Oh, God.

207
00:09:15,706 --> 00:09:18,073
There is a tradition
that the Hebrews have

208
00:09:18,075 --> 00:09:19,941
of hoisting the birthday boy

209
00:09:19,943 --> 00:09:21,977
up on a chair.

210
00:09:21,979 --> 00:09:23,512
So come over, help me celebrate

211
00:09:23,514 --> 00:09:24,980
Michael's birth moment.

212
00:09:24,982 --> 00:09:26,281
Kevin.
No, no, no.

213
00:09:26,283 --> 00:09:27,516
I'll do it.

214
00:09:27,518 --> 00:09:29,751
Ryan, come on.
Let's do this.

215
00:09:29,753 --> 00:09:33,088
I feel like we should
go get Kevin something.

216
00:09:33,090 --> 00:09:36,258
Do you think we can sneak
out of here?

217
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:39,127
Maybe, but we're going
to need somebody

218
00:09:39,129 --> 00:09:40,595
to create a diversion.

219
00:09:40,597 --> 00:09:42,798
On three
we're gonna hoist away! Ready?

220
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:45,033
Happy birth moment, Michael.

221
00:09:45,035 --> 00:09:47,669
Thank you.

222
00:09:47,671 --> 00:09:49,671
One, two, three.

223
00:09:49,673 --> 00:09:51,907
Whoa, whoa. All right.
All right.

224
00:09:51,909 --> 00:09:53,442
Watch it, please.

225
00:09:53,444 --> 00:09:54,643
It wasn't me.

226
00:09:57,814 --> 00:10:01,016
Okay, that is not
an eight-foot sub.

227
00:10:01,018 --> 00:10:02,351
We don't make
an eight-foot sub.

228
00:10:02,353 --> 00:10:03,618
This is eight one-foot subs.

229
00:10:04,921 --> 00:10:06,121
F.

230
00:10:06,123 --> 00:10:07,956
All right, what's the damage?

231
00:10:07,958 --> 00:10:10,092
39.60.

232
00:10:12,328 --> 00:10:14,963
39.

233
00:10:20,403 --> 00:10:21,636
60.

234
00:10:21,638 --> 00:10:23,138
Why tip someone for a job

235
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:24,406
I'm capable of doing myself?

236
00:10:24,408 --> 00:10:25,907
I can deliver food.

237
00:10:25,909 --> 00:10:27,709
I can drive a taxi.

238
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:30,746
I can and do cut my own hair.

239
00:10:30,748 --> 00:10:32,881
I did, however, tip my urologist

240
00:10:32,883 --> 00:10:38,120
because I am unable to pulverize
my own kidney stones.

241
00:10:38,122 --> 00:10:39,688
Here they come.

242
00:10:39,690 --> 00:10:40,856
Get in here.

243
00:10:40,858 --> 00:10:42,557
Come and get it.
Everybody.

244
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:44,626
Birthday party subs.
My gift to you.

245
00:10:44,628 --> 00:10:45,694
What is this?

246
00:10:45,696 --> 00:10:47,696
Baloney, tomato, and ketchup.
The best.

247
00:10:47,698 --> 00:10:49,498
These are all the same. Yes.

248
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:51,466
Baloney?
I don't eat baloney.

249
00:10:51,468 --> 00:10:53,969
Well, then just have
the tomato and ketchup.

250
00:10:53,971 --> 00:10:55,170
Still good.
No.

251
00:10:55,172 --> 00:10:56,938
Just the bread.
It's fresh baked.

252
00:10:56,940 --> 00:10:58,173
No.

253
00:11:00,676 --> 00:11:03,612
- Get whatever you want.
- You can choke on it.

254
00:11:03,614 --> 00:11:05,347
When I was 16,

255
00:11:05,349 --> 00:11:08,183
I was supposed to go out
on a date

256
00:11:08,185 --> 00:11:11,086
with a girl named Julie.

257
00:11:12,488 --> 00:11:14,322
But there was another
Michael in the class

258
00:11:14,324 --> 00:11:17,492
that she apparently
thought the date was with.

259
00:11:17,494 --> 00:11:20,362
So she went out with him
on my birthday.

260
00:11:20,364 --> 00:11:24,332
And she got him a cake
at the restaurant.

261
00:11:24,334 --> 00:11:26,868
And it wasn't even his birthday.

262
00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:28,737
But I heard about it
the next day in school.

263
00:11:28,739 --> 00:11:33,041
So that was the worst
birthday I think I ever had.

264
00:11:33,043 --> 00:11:35,544
So we got Kev some stuff.

265
00:11:35,546 --> 00:11:39,047
Um, party pack of M&Ms,
his favorite candy.

266
00:11:39,049 --> 00:11:42,317
A DVD of American Pie 2,
which is his favorite movie.

267
00:11:42,319 --> 00:11:43,852
And he lent it to Creed.

268
00:11:43,854 --> 00:11:46,455
So I can guarantee you
he won't get that back.

269
00:11:46,457 --> 00:11:48,457
69 Cup of Noodles.

270
00:11:48,459 --> 00:11:50,025
Which we realize sounds crass,

271
00:11:50,027 --> 00:11:51,693
but it is his favorite number.

272
00:11:51,695 --> 00:11:53,628
And his favorite lunch.

273
00:11:56,599 --> 00:11:58,600
Hey, temp, you know, uh,

274
00:11:58,602 --> 00:12:00,569
we still got five feet
of sandwich left.

275
00:12:00,571 --> 00:12:02,838
Someone ate three feet
of that thing?

276
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:04,105
Hell, yeah.

277
00:12:04,107 --> 00:12:05,941
Save room for ice cream cake.

278
00:12:05,943 --> 00:12:07,809
Thank you.
Oh, I got it.

279
00:12:07,811 --> 00:12:10,612
The party planner committee.

280
00:12:10,614 --> 00:12:12,848
This is the most important day
of the year.

281
00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:14,616
I can't risk anything.

282
00:12:15,818 --> 00:12:17,819
Fine.

283
00:12:17,821 --> 00:12:19,721
What about that meeting later

284
00:12:19,723 --> 00:12:23,758
to discuss finances?

285
00:12:24,494 --> 00:12:25,527
Yes.

286
00:12:25,529 --> 00:12:28,230
But don't expect any cookie.

287
00:12:28,232 --> 00:12:31,366
But what if I'm hungry?

288
00:12:31,368 --> 00:12:34,436
No cookie.

289
00:12:51,087 --> 00:12:52,454
What?

290
00:12:52,456 --> 00:12:54,289
You use fabric softener?

291
00:12:54,291 --> 00:12:56,958
Yeah. You don't?
No, I do.

292
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:59,294
Okay.

293
00:13:13,443 --> 00:13:16,378
Hello. Hey.

294
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:18,713
Kevin.

295
00:13:18,715 --> 00:13:20,615
Respect the birthday, please.

296
00:13:20,617 --> 00:13:24,286
No, not yet. I will.
Thanks.

297
00:13:24,288 --> 00:13:27,289
It was just Stacey.
Are you done?

298
00:13:27,291 --> 00:13:29,257
Good.

299
00:13:29,259 --> 00:13:30,859
Okay.
Here we go.

300
00:13:30,861 --> 00:13:32,227
Make a wish.
I'm gonna...

301
00:13:32,229 --> 00:13:33,395
blow out the candles.
Okay.

302
00:13:33,397 --> 00:13:35,230
Mmm.

303
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:39,501
Yeah! Yay!

304
00:13:41,003 --> 00:13:42,938
I asked for trick candles.

305
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:44,706
Pam was supposed to get them.

306
00:13:44,708 --> 00:13:47,609
Well, when she comes back,
we'll do it again.

307
00:13:47,611 --> 00:13:49,311
Hello.

308
00:13:49,313 --> 00:13:51,179
What about the birthday boy?

309
00:13:51,181 --> 00:13:53,481
Haven't had a hug all day.

310
00:13:54,617 --> 00:13:56,084
No one cares
about your birthday.

311
00:13:56,086 --> 00:13:59,287
Kevin's waiting to hear
if he has skin cancer.

312
00:14:06,162 --> 00:14:09,130
Ha, that sucks.

313
00:14:09,132 --> 00:14:10,198
Great.

314
00:14:12,768 --> 00:14:17,672
Wow, that's good timing.

315
00:14:17,674 --> 00:14:20,342
Sorry. That's terrible.
Terrible news.

316
00:14:20,344 --> 00:14:22,210
That's terrible...

317
00:14:22,212 --> 00:14:23,979
terrible news for both of us.

318
00:14:33,356 --> 00:14:36,658
We should probably head back.
Yeah. Okay.

319
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:38,960
Oh, I dare you
to make an announcement.

320
00:14:38,962 --> 00:14:41,196
You dare me?
How old are you?

321
00:14:41,198 --> 00:14:43,298
Just quit stalling.

322
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:48,570
Luke, this is your father.

323
00:14:48,572 --> 00:14:52,207
Come set the table for dinner.

324
00:14:52,209 --> 00:14:53,708
Such a dork.

325
00:14:54,577 --> 00:14:56,277
Jim Halpert,

326
00:14:56,279 --> 00:14:58,279
price check on fabric softener.

327
00:14:58,281 --> 00:14:59,547
The kind...

328
00:14:59,549 --> 00:15:00,882
Ma'am, please don't touch that.

329
00:15:00,884 --> 00:15:02,117
That is not a toy.

330
00:15:02,119 --> 00:15:05,353
I'm sorry. Sorry.

331
00:15:05,355 --> 00:15:07,689
How old are you?

332
00:15:07,691 --> 00:15:09,924
I hate you.

333
00:15:09,926 --> 00:15:11,226
Honestly, is there any way

334
00:15:11,228 --> 00:15:12,894
you can get
on your fiancee's plan?

335
00:15:12,896 --> 00:15:14,229
Our health plan
is... it's terrible.

336
00:15:14,231 --> 00:15:15,563
There you are.
Good news.

337
00:15:15,565 --> 00:15:17,065
Did some research.

338
00:15:17,067 --> 00:15:19,200
It turns out that 98%

339
00:15:19,202 --> 00:15:20,969
of people with skin cancer
fully recover.

340
00:15:21,904 --> 00:15:23,071
Still scary.

341
00:15:23,073 --> 00:15:25,407
Yeah. But it's not
brain cancer.

342
00:15:25,409 --> 00:15:27,876
And it shouldn't stop us
from having fun.

343
00:15:27,878 --> 00:15:30,712
You know what they say
the best medicine is.

344
00:15:30,714 --> 00:15:32,113
Well, the doctor said
a combination

345
00:15:32,115 --> 00:15:34,349
of Interferon and Dacarbazine.

346
00:15:34,351 --> 00:15:37,385
And laughter also.

347
00:15:37,387 --> 00:15:40,055
I don't really think people
are in the laughing mood.

348
00:15:40,057 --> 00:15:42,023
Why are you here?

349
00:15:42,025 --> 00:15:44,159
I didn't even invite you
to my birthday party.

350
00:15:44,161 --> 00:15:46,327
I work here.

351
00:15:46,329 --> 00:15:47,495
"I work here."
All right.

352
00:15:47,497 --> 00:15:48,830
Well, you know what,

353
00:15:48,832 --> 00:15:50,165
since Toby doesn't speak
for everybody

354
00:15:50,167 --> 00:15:51,366
and I am your boss,

355
00:15:51,368 --> 00:15:52,967
I think you should just go home.

356
00:15:52,969 --> 00:15:54,102
Take the rest
of the afternoon off.

357
00:15:54,104 --> 00:15:55,203
Take a sick day.

358
00:15:55,205 --> 00:15:56,438
If I go home now,

359
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:58,540
I'll just drive myself crazy.

360
00:15:58,542 --> 00:15:59,541
Well, you're pretty much

361
00:15:59,543 --> 00:16:01,109
driving everybody else
here crazy.

362
00:16:04,013 --> 00:16:05,947
Crazy with worry.

363
00:16:32,041 --> 00:16:33,074
Where have you been?

364
00:16:33,076 --> 00:16:34,142
And don't say the bathroom,

365
00:16:34,144 --> 00:16:35,543
'cause I kicked in
all the stalls.

366
00:16:35,545 --> 00:16:36,845
Well, that's an invasion
of privacy.

367
00:16:36,847 --> 00:16:38,980
So I'm going to tell Michael.

368
00:16:38,982 --> 00:16:40,381
Please don't.

369
00:16:40,383 --> 00:16:42,250
You owe me.

370
00:16:42,252 --> 00:16:43,718
Excuse me, everyone.

371
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:46,955
Attention, please.

372
00:16:46,957 --> 00:16:48,857
Kevin,

373
00:16:48,859 --> 00:16:50,992
we're going to take you
to a very special place.

374
00:16:50,994 --> 00:16:52,660
A place that will make you happy

375
00:16:52,662 --> 00:16:56,698
and a place that is far,
far away from the evil sun.

376
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:58,399
Is this trip in any way related

377
00:16:58,401 --> 00:17:00,468
to your birthday?

378
00:17:00,470 --> 00:17:04,038
How dare you, sir?
You're gross.

379
00:17:05,674 --> 00:17:06,775
That should not be there.

380
00:17:06,777 --> 00:17:08,009
I'll get someone
to take it down.

381
00:17:08,011 --> 00:17:09,110
No, it's all right.
It's already up.

382
00:17:09,112 --> 00:17:10,245
Just leave it.

383
00:17:10,247 --> 00:17:11,312
Where's Kevin?
Come on.

384
00:17:11,314 --> 00:17:13,114
Let's get our skate on.

385
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:16,184
Don't be scared.
You're good.

386
00:17:16,186 --> 00:17:18,586
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
You're good.

387
00:17:18,588 --> 00:17:19,654
Oh, hi.

388
00:17:25,594 --> 00:17:28,463
Think you can let go?
No.

389
00:17:28,465 --> 00:17:30,799
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

390
00:17:30,801 --> 00:17:32,133
Yeah!

391
00:17:32,135 --> 00:17:33,668
Is that Michael?

392
00:17:33,670 --> 00:17:36,304
Yeah, I've been pretty much
skating my whole life.

393
00:17:36,306 --> 00:17:38,506
I thought about playing
in the NHL.

394
00:17:38,508 --> 00:17:40,408
But you're on the road so much.

395
00:17:40,410 --> 00:17:43,044
Get no time to spend
with your wife and kids.

396
00:17:43,046 --> 00:17:45,246
And I really want
a wife and kids.

397
00:17:46,515 --> 00:17:48,116
Aaaaah!

398
00:17:48,118 --> 00:17:49,717
Ha ha ha ha.

399
00:17:51,253 --> 00:17:52,620
I got it.

400
00:17:53,889 --> 00:17:56,424
Hey, Pam,
all the stuff with Kevin,

401
00:17:56,426 --> 00:17:58,726
um, it's pretty scary.

402
00:17:58,728 --> 00:18:01,496
And I'm thinking that next time
you're in the shower,

403
00:18:01,498 --> 00:18:02,697
you should check yourself out.

404
00:18:02,699 --> 00:18:04,032
You know, give yourself an exam.

405
00:18:04,034 --> 00:18:06,534
Those things are like
ticking time bags.

406
00:18:06,536 --> 00:18:09,070
All right?
Think about it.

407
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:14,175
Something to think about.

408
00:18:14,177 --> 00:18:15,910
Just can't relax about it...
Kevin.

409
00:18:15,912 --> 00:18:18,413
Have you heard anything yet?

410
00:18:18,415 --> 00:18:19,881
No, not yet.

411
00:18:19,883 --> 00:18:21,115
Okay, well, Livestrong.

412
00:18:21,117 --> 00:18:22,450
Okay, Michael.

413
00:18:22,452 --> 00:18:23,785
Michael?

414
00:18:23,787 --> 00:18:25,453
Yeah. Carole?

415
00:18:25,455 --> 00:18:27,422
She sold me my condo.

416
00:18:27,424 --> 00:18:31,593
Hey, was this place
on the market or...

417
00:18:31,595 --> 00:18:33,595
No, I don't just sell
real estate.

418
00:18:33,597 --> 00:18:35,563
My daughter has
a skating lesson.

419
00:18:35,565 --> 00:18:37,398
Oh, these all your kids?

420
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:40,235
No, just the front two.

421
00:18:40,237 --> 00:18:42,704
Oh, hey, guys. What's up?
You want to go for a ride?

422
00:18:42,706 --> 00:18:44,239
Is that okay?
Sure.

423
00:18:44,241 --> 00:18:45,640
Cool. All right. Grab on.

424
00:18:45,642 --> 00:18:47,542
Here we go. You ready?

425
00:18:47,544 --> 00:18:50,912
Hang on tight.
All right.

426
00:18:50,914 --> 00:18:54,716
We are moving.
We are really moving now.

427
00:18:58,988 --> 00:19:00,788
Push. Good.
That's great. You got it.

428
00:19:02,492 --> 00:19:04,058
'Scuse me.

429
00:19:05,828 --> 00:19:09,764
Hello. Yeah, okay.

430
00:19:11,367 --> 00:19:12,967
All right.

431
00:19:14,403 --> 00:19:16,371
Okay, I will. Thanks.

432
00:19:17,573 --> 00:19:19,274
It's negative.

433
00:19:21,278 --> 00:19:22,510
God.

434
00:19:28,884 --> 00:19:30,551
We're going to beat this, okay?

435
00:19:30,553 --> 00:19:33,955
We're gonna...
Come here.

436
00:19:35,491 --> 00:19:37,292
Well, apparently,
in the medicine community,

437
00:19:37,294 --> 00:19:39,027
negative means good,

438
00:19:39,029 --> 00:19:41,162
which makes absolutely no sense.

439
00:19:41,164 --> 00:19:44,666
In the real world community,

440
00:19:44,668 --> 00:19:48,603
that would be chaos.

441
00:19:48,605 --> 00:19:51,639
This is awesome.

442
00:19:51,641 --> 00:19:54,275
Thanks, you guys.

443
00:19:54,277 --> 00:19:56,511
Okay, who's this from?

444
00:19:58,814 --> 00:20:01,983
Wowie. Look at that jersey.

445
00:20:01,985 --> 00:20:04,185
Turn it around.
Turn it around.

446
00:20:04,187 --> 00:20:06,321
Cool. Oh.
Show it.

447
00:20:06,323 --> 00:20:07,922
Great.
From Dwight.

448
00:20:07,924 --> 00:20:09,791
Number one!
Thank you, Dwight.

449
00:20:09,793 --> 00:20:11,092
That's great. Thanks.

450
00:20:11,094 --> 00:20:13,061
Michael, this is from all of us.

451
00:20:13,063 --> 00:20:15,830
Oh, you didn't need to do that.

452
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:22,136
Night Swept.
This is really amazing.

453
00:20:22,138 --> 00:20:23,204
Thank you.

454
00:20:23,206 --> 00:20:24,439
I love it.

455
00:20:25,307 --> 00:20:28,609
Michael's birthday
was actually pretty cool.

456
00:20:28,611 --> 00:20:30,278
It was a good day.

457
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:34,015
I don't know.
It was a good day.
