1
00:00:01,037 --> 00:00:02,037
I am actually looking forward

2
00:00:02,039 --> 00:00:03,072
to take your daughter
to work day.

3
00:00:03,074 --> 00:00:05,507
I am not great with kids.

4
00:00:05,509 --> 00:00:07,810
But I wanna get better
because I'm getting married.

5
00:00:07,812 --> 00:00:10,779
So I put out a bunch
of extra candy on my desk

6
00:00:10,781 --> 00:00:12,714
so the kids
will come talk to me.

7
00:00:14,551 --> 00:00:17,019
Like the witch
in Hansel and Gretel.

8
00:00:17,021 --> 00:00:18,987
Bribery.
Nice.

9
00:00:18,989 --> 00:00:20,489
Oh, I have more.

10
00:00:20,491 --> 00:00:21,790
It's Pam.

11
00:00:21,792 --> 00:00:23,926
Ms. Beasley
if you're nasty.

12
00:00:23,928 --> 00:00:25,094
Janet Jackson.

13
00:00:25,096 --> 00:00:26,128
Hey, you having
a wardrobe malfunction, or...

14
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:27,963
You can't be nasty today.

15
00:00:29,866 --> 00:00:31,667
Oh, God.
Is that today?

16
00:00:31,669 --> 00:00:33,202
I reminded you last night.

17
00:00:33,204 --> 00:00:35,170
Listen, I like kids.

18
00:00:35,172 --> 00:00:36,405
But this is not
a kids environment.

19
00:00:36,407 --> 00:00:39,341
This is like HBO.
No limits.

20
00:00:39,343 --> 00:00:40,843
Who knows what I'm gonna say?

21
00:00:40,845 --> 00:00:42,077
Crazy stuff.

22
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:43,946
And it is R rated.

23
00:00:43,948 --> 00:00:45,481
It is not rated G.

24
00:00:45,483 --> 00:00:48,117
I am like Eddie Murphy in Raw.

25
00:00:48,119 --> 00:00:50,319
And they are trying
to make me into

26
00:00:50,321 --> 00:00:51,787
Eddie Murphy in Daddy Daycare.

27
00:00:51,789 --> 00:00:54,323
Both great movies, but still.

28
00:00:54,325 --> 00:00:56,458
Well, I'll be in my office.

29
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:57,759
Don't you think
you should say something?

30
00:00:57,761 --> 00:00:58,894
They're cool.

31
00:00:58,896 --> 00:01:00,596
Michael, I think
that as the boss, you should...

32
00:01:00,598 --> 00:01:02,564
Fine fine fine fine fine!

33
00:01:02,566 --> 00:01:03,765
Hi, children.

34
00:01:03,767 --> 00:01:06,835
I'm Michael Scott.

35
00:01:06,837 --> 00:01:09,671
And I am in charge
of this place.

36
00:01:09,673 --> 00:01:12,741
Uh, how do I make you
understand?

37
00:01:12,743 --> 00:01:15,410
I am like Superman.

38
00:01:15,412 --> 00:01:16,478
And the people who work here

39
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:18,480
are like citizens
of Gotham city.

40
00:01:18,482 --> 00:01:19,615
That's Batman.
That's Batman.

41
00:01:19,617 --> 00:01:21,483
Okay, I'm Aquaman.

42
00:01:21,485 --> 00:01:22,818
Where does he live, guys?

43
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:23,886
The ocean.

44
00:01:24,454 --> 00:01:26,355
I work with a bunch of nerds.

45
00:02:07,330 --> 00:02:09,998
Mmm.
Hello, tiny one.

46
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,934
Come on.

47
00:02:11,936 --> 00:02:13,936
You are the future.

48
00:02:16,139 --> 00:02:19,908
This is my file cabinet.

49
00:02:23,646 --> 00:02:25,514
Um...

50
00:02:26,883 --> 00:02:32,487
Oh, this is the partition
between my desk

51
00:02:32,489 --> 00:02:33,755
and Angela's.

52
00:02:35,325 --> 00:02:37,659
Abby's my fiancÃ© Stacy's
daughter.

53
00:02:37,661 --> 00:02:39,294
I think she'll have a good time.

54
00:02:39,296 --> 00:02:44,099
I just hope she doesn't
look on my computer.

55
00:02:44,101 --> 00:02:47,135
Actually, I'd better go check.

56
00:02:49,572 --> 00:02:51,406
Michael, you remember
my daughter Melissa.

57
00:02:51,408 --> 00:02:53,342
Oh, yes.
Hello, how are you?

58
00:02:53,344 --> 00:02:54,376
Good to see you.

59
00:02:54,378 --> 00:02:55,677
Wow, you've really grown up.

60
00:02:55,679 --> 00:02:57,512
You know what?

61
00:02:57,514 --> 00:02:58,780
Don't mind me saying so.

62
00:02:58,782 --> 00:03:01,383
She is turning into
a stone cold fox.

63
00:03:01,385 --> 00:03:03,752
Better keep the frat boys
away from her.

64
00:03:03,754 --> 00:03:05,420
I'm in 8th grade.

65
00:03:05,422 --> 00:03:07,889
Oh...
She's in middle school.

66
00:03:07,891 --> 00:03:09,491
Yeah, middle school's amazing.

67
00:03:09,493 --> 00:03:10,826
It is extraordinary.

68
00:03:10,828 --> 00:03:12,127
An extraordinary time.

69
00:03:12,129 --> 00:03:14,196
It's not that children
make me uncomfortable.

70
00:03:14,198 --> 00:03:15,931
It's just that, why be a dad

71
00:03:15,933 --> 00:03:17,532
when you can be a fun uncle?

72
00:03:17,534 --> 00:03:18,867
I've never heard
of anyone rebelling

73
00:03:18,869 --> 00:03:20,402
against their fun uncle.

74
00:03:20,404 --> 00:03:22,537
They want how many spiral pads?

75
00:03:22,539 --> 00:03:25,274
Uh, well, 50.

76
00:03:25,276 --> 00:03:27,809
I over ordered because
they had a back order.

77
00:03:27,811 --> 00:03:29,478
I got permission
to bring Jakey in to work.

78
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:32,047
Which is great because
he got suspended this week,

79
00:03:32,049 --> 00:03:35,284
and now I don't have to
pay for a sitter.

80
00:03:35,286 --> 00:03:37,252
Can you pull that down there?

81
00:03:38,421 --> 00:03:40,122
Okay, tell 'em
what you wanted to say.

82
00:03:40,124 --> 00:03:41,256
Do you need any help?

83
00:03:41,258 --> 00:03:43,859
No, thanks.

84
00:03:43,861 --> 00:03:45,961
We'd have to explain everything.

85
00:03:45,963 --> 00:03:48,363
It's probably just easier
if we do it ourselves.

86
00:03:50,333 --> 00:03:51,667
All right,
I wasn't expecting that.

87
00:03:51,669 --> 00:03:53,969
Let's go draw.

88
00:03:53,971 --> 00:03:56,104
Oh, my God.
She is so cute, I wanna die.

89
00:03:56,106 --> 00:03:59,308
Don't you just
love kids, Angela?

90
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:02,344
I guess I wouldn't mind a pair
of small, well behaved boys.

91
00:04:02,346 --> 00:04:04,613
God, I cannot wait
to get pregnant

92
00:04:04,615 --> 00:04:06,515
and have babies.

93
00:04:07,583 --> 00:04:10,252
Kelly and I both agreed
that we would just have fun.

94
00:04:10,254 --> 00:04:12,688
And I'm learning
that fun for Kelly

95
00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:16,558
is getting married
and having babies.

96
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:19,294
Immediately.
With me.

97
00:04:19,996 --> 00:04:21,797
Just compare last year's orders

98
00:04:21,799 --> 00:04:23,899
with this year's.
Uh-huh.

99
00:04:23,901 --> 00:04:25,667
Yeah, I'm looking
at it right now.

100
00:04:29,472 --> 00:04:31,406
Yes.

101
00:04:32,508 --> 00:04:33,575
We...

102
00:04:35,211 --> 00:04:37,179
Yeah, they're very...

103
00:04:37,914 --> 00:04:39,314
They're different.

104
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:42,284
Yeah, we can stick
with last year's.

105
00:04:42,286 --> 00:04:44,186
We're just gonna have to
supplement it somehow.

106
00:04:44,188 --> 00:04:49,591
Hey, Abby, do you wanna help me
shred some old documents?

107
00:04:49,593 --> 00:04:51,393
It's actually pretty cool.

108
00:04:51,395 --> 00:04:52,461
No, thanks.

109
00:04:54,163 --> 00:04:56,264
I only have one goal today.

110
00:04:56,266 --> 00:04:58,033
To make one kid like me.

111
00:04:59,469 --> 00:05:01,002
Just one.

112
00:05:01,004 --> 00:05:02,304
What are you reading?

113
00:05:02,306 --> 00:05:05,474
From the Mixed Up Files
of Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler.

114
00:05:05,476 --> 00:05:07,709
Oh, best book.

115
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:09,745
Yeah, but I read it before.

116
00:05:09,747 --> 00:05:11,413
So have I.

117
00:05:11,415 --> 00:05:14,182
Hey, question, if you had
to spend the night in the Met

118
00:05:14,184 --> 00:05:16,418
or the aquarium,
which would it be?

119
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:18,120
Definitely the aquarium.
Definitely.

120
00:05:18,122 --> 00:05:20,789
Yes.
Glad you said that.

121
00:05:20,791 --> 00:05:22,758
You don't wanna help me
with some of my sales, do you?

122
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:23,959
'Cause I'm kinda swamped.

123
00:05:23,961 --> 00:05:25,160
Sure.
Really?

124
00:05:25,162 --> 00:05:26,161
Mmm-hmm.

125
00:05:26,163 --> 00:05:29,264
Yes.
And you're Abby, right?

126
00:05:29,266 --> 00:05:30,599
Yeah.
I'm Jim.

127
00:05:30,601 --> 00:05:32,768
Let's sell some paper.

128
00:05:32,770 --> 00:05:33,869
All right.

129
00:05:33,871 --> 00:05:36,638
Let's start with your mom.

130
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:37,706
Yes.

131
00:05:37,708 --> 00:05:41,243
Well, we can...
Um...

132
00:05:42,278 --> 00:05:43,912
Hey, you know what?
Can I call you back?

133
00:05:43,914 --> 00:05:44,980
I'll call you right back.

134
00:05:44,982 --> 00:05:46,314
Yes, I promise.

135
00:05:50,219 --> 00:05:52,521
Hello.
Can I help you?

136
00:05:55,191 --> 00:05:56,691
You can pick that up
if you want.

137
00:05:56,693 --> 00:05:58,193
That's all right.

138
00:05:59,762 --> 00:06:01,496
Wanna bring it over...

139
00:06:01,498 --> 00:06:03,432
Here, I'll make some room.

140
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:13,308
My name's Michael.
What's your name?

141
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:15,610
Sasha.
Nice to meet you.

142
00:06:15,612 --> 00:06:17,479
Ooh!
Oh, you know what that is?

143
00:06:17,481 --> 00:06:19,714
That is a train whistle.

144
00:06:19,716 --> 00:06:21,883
Like I'm the conductor.

145
00:06:21,885 --> 00:06:24,719
But I'm sort of the conductor
of the office here, right?

146
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:27,823
You wanna try?

147
00:06:27,825 --> 00:06:29,057
Sure.

148
00:06:29,059 --> 00:06:30,392
All aboard for sales!

149
00:06:32,129 --> 00:06:35,430
Next stop,
Cook... camonga!

150
00:06:36,433 --> 00:06:38,366
Ow ow ow ow, you broke my hand.

151
00:06:38,368 --> 00:06:40,068
There is no way that hurt.

152
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:43,271
Really? 'Cause she's
pretty strong, Dwight.

153
00:06:43,273 --> 00:06:46,808
Little girl, come over here.

154
00:06:46,810 --> 00:06:48,743
Shake my hand.

155
00:06:48,745 --> 00:06:50,178
Come on, I don't have all day.

156
00:06:53,049 --> 00:06:55,317
I didn't feel anything.
Nothing.

157
00:06:55,319 --> 00:06:56,952
You're so weak.

158
00:07:01,457 --> 00:07:03,692
Excuse me, these are
expensive collector's items.

159
00:07:03,694 --> 00:07:04,726
Okay?

160
00:07:04,728 --> 00:07:05,760
Do you have any computer games?

161
00:07:05,762 --> 00:07:07,629
No, I don't have computer games

162
00:07:07,631 --> 00:07:09,297
on my work computer.
That would be inappropriate.

163
00:07:09,299 --> 00:07:11,166
Yeah, Meredith doesn't
have any either.

164
00:07:11,168 --> 00:07:12,601
It's so lame here.

165
00:07:12,603 --> 00:07:14,936
You call your mom Meredith?

166
00:07:14,938 --> 00:07:16,004
That's very disrespectful.

167
00:07:16,006 --> 00:07:17,339
Whatever, okay?

168
00:07:17,341 --> 00:07:20,408
You can refer to me
as Mr. Schroot.

169
00:07:20,410 --> 00:07:21,910
That's your name?
Mm-hmm.

170
00:07:21,912 --> 00:07:22,911
Mr. Poop?

171
00:07:22,913 --> 00:07:25,313
Schroot.
Mr. Schroot.

172
00:07:25,315 --> 00:07:27,315
Sure, Mr. Poop.

173
00:07:30,553 --> 00:07:31,820
Schroot.

174
00:07:39,428 --> 00:07:41,129
Are you Mother Goose?

175
00:07:44,066 --> 00:07:45,934
I drink, like,
100 iced macchiatos a day

176
00:07:45,936 --> 00:07:48,803
and practically nothing else.
Wow.

177
00:07:48,805 --> 00:07:51,006
There's a really
cool coffee place, Jitters,

178
00:07:51,008 --> 00:07:53,608
at the Steamtown Mall.
You ever been there?

179
00:07:53,610 --> 00:07:54,709
No.

180
00:07:54,711 --> 00:07:56,745
You've never been to Jitters?

181
00:07:56,747 --> 00:07:58,647
Ryan, you are so dorky.

182
00:07:58,649 --> 00:08:02,017
Give me your number
so I can text you.

183
00:08:02,019 --> 00:08:03,485
Um...

184
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:05,887
Come on.

185
00:08:05,889 --> 00:08:07,689
Can I have your email address?

186
00:08:07,691 --> 00:08:09,190
I just thought
you should know...

187
00:08:09,192 --> 00:08:10,592
Mmm-hmm?

188
00:08:10,594 --> 00:08:13,161
I think something
a little fishy is going on.

189
00:08:13,163 --> 00:08:15,130
A little fishy?
Yeah.

190
00:08:15,132 --> 00:08:16,565
I mean, I've been
noticing them all day.

191
00:08:16,567 --> 00:08:17,999
And I was thinking...

192
00:08:18,001 --> 00:08:19,868
That little girl is a child!

193
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:22,404
I don't wanna see you
sniffing around her

194
00:08:22,406 --> 00:08:23,805
anymore this afternoon.
Do you understand?

195
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:25,674
Yes.
Boy, have you lost your mind?

196
00:08:25,676 --> 00:08:26,775
'Cause I'll help you find it.

197
00:08:26,777 --> 00:08:27,842
Whatcha looking for?

198
00:08:27,844 --> 00:08:28,877
Ain't nobody gonna
help you out there.

199
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:30,045
Jesus can come
through that door,

200
00:08:30,047 --> 00:08:33,248
if you don't stop sniffing
after my child. Okay.

201
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:35,917
Stanley yelled at me today.

202
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:37,586
That was one of the most
frightening experiences

203
00:08:37,588 --> 00:08:38,820
of my life.

204
00:08:51,168 --> 00:08:52,701
That was Greensleeves.

205
00:08:52,703 --> 00:08:54,135
A traditional English ballad

206
00:08:54,137 --> 00:08:55,637
about the beheaded Anne Boleyn.

207
00:08:55,639 --> 00:08:58,540
And now, a very special treat.

208
00:08:58,542 --> 00:09:00,442
A book my granmutter
used to read me

209
00:09:00,444 --> 00:09:01,977
when I was a kid.

210
00:09:01,979 --> 00:09:03,411
This is a very special story.

211
00:09:03,413 --> 00:09:07,349
It's called Struwwelpeter
by Heinrich Hoffmann

212
00:09:07,351 --> 00:09:09,451
from 1864.

213
00:09:10,486 --> 00:09:14,322
The great tall tailor
always comes to little girls

214
00:09:14,324 --> 00:09:16,458
that suck their thumbs.
Are you listening, Sasha?

215
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:17,559
Right?

216
00:09:17,561 --> 00:09:19,594
And ere they dream
what he is about,

217
00:09:19,596 --> 00:09:21,930
he takes his great
sharp scissors out

218
00:09:21,932 --> 00:09:24,099
and then cuts their thumbs
clean off.

219
00:09:24,101 --> 00:09:25,200
Dwight, Dwight.

220
00:09:25,202 --> 00:09:26,868
What the hell are you reading?

221
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:28,403
These are cautionary tales
for kids, Michael.

222
00:09:28,405 --> 00:09:29,404
Yeah, you know what?
No.

223
00:09:29,406 --> 00:09:30,572
No no no no no.

224
00:09:30,574 --> 00:09:32,774
The kids don't wanna hear
some weirdo book

225
00:09:32,776 --> 00:09:35,010
that your Nazi war criminal
grandmother gave you.

226
00:09:35,012 --> 00:09:36,111
What's a Nazi?

227
00:09:36,113 --> 00:09:37,312
What's a Nazi?

228
00:09:37,314 --> 00:09:38,613
Nazi was a fascist movement
in the 1930s.

229
00:09:38,615 --> 00:09:40,915
Don't talk about Nazis
in front of...

230
00:09:40,917 --> 00:09:42,884
You know what?
They're gonna have nightmares.

231
00:09:42,886 --> 00:09:44,085
Why don't you just shut it?

232
00:09:44,087 --> 00:09:45,687
I was gonna teach the children
how to make

233
00:09:45,689 --> 00:09:47,455
corn husk dolls.

234
00:09:47,457 --> 00:09:49,557
Why don't you just leave, okay?

235
00:09:51,727 --> 00:09:52,894
Bye, Mr. Poop.

236
00:09:52,896 --> 00:09:55,030
All right,
there goes Mr. Poop.

237
00:09:55,032 --> 00:09:56,898
Now, who likes Dane Cook?

238
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:57,966
I do!

239
00:09:57,968 --> 00:09:59,334
Children cannot lie.

240
00:09:59,336 --> 00:10:00,902
They are innocent,
and they speak the truth.

241
00:10:00,904 --> 00:10:04,139
And out of the mouths of babes,

242
00:10:04,141 --> 00:10:06,508
Michael Scott is freakin' cool.

243
00:10:12,648 --> 00:10:15,583
You know, I never misbehaved
in front of my father.

244
00:10:15,585 --> 00:10:18,520
Because he was a very strict
disciplinarian.

245
00:10:18,522 --> 00:10:19,721
I can only hope my mate

246
00:10:19,723 --> 00:10:22,090
has some of those
same qualities.

247
00:10:27,063 --> 00:10:29,931
This is where the magic happens.

248
00:10:29,933 --> 00:10:31,599
Right over here,
let me show you this.

249
00:10:31,601 --> 00:10:33,234
See all these?

250
00:10:34,070 --> 00:10:35,770
You know what that is?
That's paper.

251
00:10:35,772 --> 00:10:37,739
This is where paper comes from.

252
00:10:37,741 --> 00:10:39,107
Any questions?

253
00:10:39,109 --> 00:10:42,177
So, you cut the paper
and dye it and stuff?

254
00:10:42,179 --> 00:10:44,512
No, we don't actually
cut the paper.

255
00:10:44,514 --> 00:10:45,580
That's a good question.

256
00:10:45,582 --> 00:10:48,016
The paper is sent to us
cut and dyed

257
00:10:48,018 --> 00:10:49,751
from a paper manufacturer.

258
00:10:49,753 --> 00:10:51,786
And then we sell it
to a business

259
00:10:51,788 --> 00:10:53,855
for more than we pay for it.

260
00:10:53,857 --> 00:10:55,090
That's not fair.

261
00:10:55,092 --> 00:10:57,025
No.
Yes, it is.

262
00:10:57,027 --> 00:10:58,893
It's... well, you need someone
in the middle to facilitate...

263
00:10:58,895 --> 00:10:59,928
You're just a middleman.

264
00:10:59,930 --> 00:11:01,262
I'm not just a middleman.

265
00:11:01,264 --> 00:11:02,797
Wait, why doesn't the sawmill
just sell the paper

266
00:11:02,799 --> 00:11:04,032
directly to people?

267
00:11:04,034 --> 00:11:06,568
You are describing Office Depot.

268
00:11:06,570 --> 00:11:08,336
And they're kind of
running us out of business.

269
00:11:08,338 --> 00:11:11,206
We have better service
than they do.

270
00:11:12,876 --> 00:11:18,012
There's Creed! Let's take a look
at what he's doing, everybody.

271
00:11:18,014 --> 00:11:20,181
This is Creed.

272
00:11:20,183 --> 00:11:23,284
And he is in charge
of... something, right?

273
00:11:23,286 --> 00:11:24,686
That is correct.
Say hi to the kids.

274
00:11:24,688 --> 00:11:25,754
Hi, kids.

275
00:11:27,123 --> 00:11:29,691
You ever seen a foot
with four toes?

276
00:11:29,693 --> 00:11:30,692
Eww!
What are you doing?

277
00:11:30,694 --> 00:11:31,926
Stop it, stop it!

278
00:11:31,928 --> 00:11:33,094
Just no no no.
No, no!

279
00:11:33,096 --> 00:11:34,229
Would you cut it out?

280
00:11:34,231 --> 00:11:35,230
What is your problem?

281
00:11:35,232 --> 00:11:36,531
No no no.

282
00:11:36,533 --> 00:11:38,867
We're not gonna see
the four-toed Creed, okay?

283
00:11:38,869 --> 00:11:40,835
You know,
there's something interesting

284
00:11:40,837 --> 00:11:41,903
about me that you
might wanna know.

285
00:11:41,905 --> 00:11:44,739
I used to be the star
of a kids show.

286
00:11:44,741 --> 00:11:46,741
No way.
It's true, I did.

287
00:11:46,743 --> 00:11:47,909
You serious?

288
00:11:47,911 --> 00:11:49,177
I am totally serious.

289
00:11:49,179 --> 00:11:51,179
There was a show
called Fundle Bundle,

290
00:11:51,181 --> 00:11:52,847
and I was the star.

291
00:11:52,849 --> 00:11:54,382
What?
It's true.

292
00:11:54,384 --> 00:11:55,483
I can prove it.

293
00:11:55,485 --> 00:11:56,751
I can prove it.
Watch this.

294
00:11:56,753 --> 00:11:58,052
Ryan, can you
come here a second?

295
00:11:59,588 --> 00:12:01,022
I would like you to go
to my mother's house

296
00:12:01,024 --> 00:12:02,557
in Dixon City.

297
00:12:02,559 --> 00:12:04,659
And if she's at the pool,

298
00:12:04,661 --> 00:12:05,860
the back kitchen window
should be unlocked.

299
00:12:05,862 --> 00:12:07,128
I want you boost yourself up.

300
00:12:07,130 --> 00:12:08,496
I want you to go
down to the basement.

301
00:12:08,498 --> 00:12:10,965
In the basement is a tape
labeled Fundle Bundle.

302
00:12:10,967 --> 00:12:13,535
I want you grab it.
I want you to get my guitar.

303
00:12:13,537 --> 00:12:14,636
I want you to get a tambourine.

304
00:12:14,638 --> 00:12:16,104
Do you know how
to play the tambourine?

305
00:12:16,106 --> 00:12:17,939
I'm already getting the pizzas
from Brenetti's, so...

306
00:12:17,941 --> 00:12:19,073
I can go with him.

307
00:12:19,075 --> 00:12:20,875
No, I will go.

308
00:12:20,877 --> 00:12:23,645
Okay!
Thank you, Ryan.

309
00:12:23,647 --> 00:12:24,946
Good attitude.
Hottest in the office.

310
00:12:24,948 --> 00:12:28,383
All right, now what kind
of pizza do you like?

311
00:12:28,385 --> 00:12:29,784
I don't get why parents
are always complaining

312
00:12:29,786 --> 00:12:31,820
about how tough it is
to raise kids.

313
00:12:31,822 --> 00:12:35,023
You joke around with them.
You give 'em pizza.

314
00:12:35,025 --> 00:12:36,191
You give 'em candy.

315
00:12:36,193 --> 00:12:37,559
You let 'em live their lives.

316
00:12:37,561 --> 00:12:38,927
They're adults, for God's sake.

317
00:12:38,929 --> 00:12:42,730
I am going to give you
a little blast from the past

318
00:12:42,732 --> 00:12:45,733
of Michael Gary Scott
when he was a child star.

319
00:12:45,735 --> 00:12:47,335
And a show
that you might remember

320
00:12:47,337 --> 00:12:49,103
called Fundle Bundle.

321
00:12:49,105 --> 00:12:50,972
Okay, without further ado, Ryan?

322
00:12:50,974 --> 00:12:53,741
Bundle, are you read
to come on in?

323
00:12:53,743 --> 00:12:55,844
Yeah!
Let's have some fun!

324
00:12:55,846 --> 00:12:57,078
That is Miss Trudy.

325
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,646
Can't tell from her costume,

326
00:12:58,648 --> 00:13:00,515
but she had an amazing body.

327
00:13:01,817 --> 00:13:03,852
Okay, you can fast forward.

328
00:13:03,854 --> 00:13:06,120
And, I want you...
It's coming up... stop!

329
00:13:06,122 --> 00:13:07,589
Stop stop!

330
00:13:07,591 --> 00:13:08,723
Stop.

331
00:13:10,125 --> 00:13:11,125
Yes!

332
00:13:11,127 --> 00:13:13,528
That is Edward R. Meow.

333
00:13:13,530 --> 00:13:15,964
That's pretty funny.

334
00:13:15,966 --> 00:13:17,265
Yeah.

335
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:19,934
Hey, what's your name?

336
00:13:19,936 --> 00:13:21,402
My name's Chet.

337
00:13:21,404 --> 00:13:22,637
Well, hi, Chet.

338
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:24,472
Is that Chet Montgomery?

339
00:13:24,474 --> 00:13:26,307
I don't know.
Yeah, that is!

340
00:13:26,309 --> 00:13:28,376
He's the meteorologist
from channel 4.

341
00:13:28,378 --> 00:13:31,079
Checking in with Chet.
Doppler 7.

342
00:13:31,081 --> 00:13:32,881
That guy's legit.

343
00:13:32,883 --> 00:13:35,149
What do you wanna be
when you grow up?

344
00:13:35,151 --> 00:13:36,851
I wanna be on TV.

345
00:13:36,853 --> 00:13:39,921
And he is on TV now!

346
00:13:39,923 --> 00:13:42,123
Everybody please shut up.
Please.

347
00:13:42,125 --> 00:13:43,524
So you don't miss it.

348
00:13:43,526 --> 00:13:45,994
Okay, next.

349
00:13:45,996 --> 00:13:47,462
So, what's your name?
That's me.

350
00:13:47,464 --> 00:13:49,030
That's me.

351
00:13:50,467 --> 00:13:53,635
Well, what's your favorite
subject in school?

352
00:13:53,637 --> 00:13:54,669
Recess.

353
00:13:54,671 --> 00:13:56,170
Recess.

354
00:13:56,172 --> 00:13:58,606
So, tell me,
what do you wanna be

355
00:13:58,608 --> 00:13:59,974
when you grow up?

356
00:13:59,976 --> 00:14:02,343
I wanna be married
and have 100 kids

357
00:14:02,345 --> 00:14:05,146
so I can have 100 friends.

358
00:14:05,148 --> 00:14:07,348
And no one can say no
to being my friend.

359
00:14:12,187 --> 00:14:14,255
Uh...
Oh, okay.

360
00:14:14,257 --> 00:14:16,024
Well, nice talking with you,
Michael.

361
00:14:16,026 --> 00:14:17,759
Back to you, Miss Trudy!

362
00:14:17,761 --> 00:14:19,761
Hi, everyone,
it's one of my favorite..

363
00:14:19,763 --> 00:14:20,795
Could have sworn there was...

364
00:14:20,797 --> 00:14:22,697
Did you get married?

365
00:14:22,699 --> 00:14:23,698
Uh, no.

366
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:24,699
Why not?

367
00:14:24,701 --> 00:14:27,235
Uh, it just never happened.

368
00:14:27,237 --> 00:14:29,837
So do you have any kids?

369
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:31,539
Uh, nope.

370
00:14:31,541 --> 00:14:33,007
Do you have a girlfriend?
I do okay.

371
00:14:33,009 --> 00:14:34,075
Was Chet Montgomery
cool back then?

372
00:14:34,077 --> 00:14:35,510
Yes.
Even I have a girlfriend.

373
00:14:35,512 --> 00:14:36,744
Okay.
All right, okay.

374
00:14:36,746 --> 00:14:39,314
So you didn't get to be
what you wanted to be.

375
00:14:41,583 --> 00:14:43,084
I guess not.

376
00:14:45,287 --> 00:14:47,789
You know, I have
a load of work to do.

377
00:14:47,791 --> 00:14:49,824
So I am going to grab a slice

378
00:14:49,826 --> 00:14:51,459
of this delish pizza.

379
00:14:52,294 --> 00:14:54,562
And I'm gonna go do my work.

380
00:14:54,564 --> 00:14:56,397
Bye.

381
00:15:06,475 --> 00:15:08,076
He's not coming out.

382
00:15:08,078 --> 00:15:09,310
He won't pick up the phone.

383
00:15:09,312 --> 00:15:11,012
I can't believe his mom
dressed him like that.

384
00:15:11,014 --> 00:15:12,714
That's the real tragedy.

385
00:15:13,615 --> 00:15:15,049
Pam, Pam!

386
00:15:15,051 --> 00:15:16,351
I love this guy.

387
00:15:26,862 --> 00:15:30,198
So, Melissa, I met
your mom a couple times.

388
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:32,266
She's so nice.

389
00:15:32,268 --> 00:15:34,936
Who, Terry?
Mmm-hmm.

390
00:15:34,938 --> 00:15:38,206
That woman is not my mother.
That is my stepmother.

391
00:15:42,544 --> 00:15:43,778
Mr. Poop,
I have to tell you something.

392
00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:46,381
Uh, okay, but first
that's not my name.

393
00:15:46,383 --> 00:15:47,548
You're ugly.

394
00:15:50,753 --> 00:15:53,087
Well, at least I'm not
a horrible little latchkey kid

395
00:15:53,089 --> 00:15:57,525
who got suspended from school,
so...

396
00:15:57,527 --> 00:15:58,960
Meredith!

397
00:16:12,142 --> 00:16:13,341
Yeah?

398
00:16:14,476 --> 00:16:17,178
I think these belong to you.

399
00:16:18,881 --> 00:16:21,049
Oh, that's okay.
She can keep those.

400
00:16:21,051 --> 00:16:23,518
Believe me, she has enough toys.

401
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:26,054
She doesn't need your watch.

402
00:16:26,056 --> 00:16:27,288
Thank you.

403
00:16:30,559 --> 00:16:32,260
Is everything okay?

404
00:16:34,063 --> 00:16:35,630
You have to ask me that

405
00:16:35,632 --> 00:16:37,298
because you work for
human resources.

406
00:16:38,634 --> 00:16:40,001
That's true.

407
00:16:40,003 --> 00:16:42,503
You know, sure,
playing the field is great.

408
00:16:42,505 --> 00:16:43,638
Don't get me wrong.

409
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:44,839
But there's more to life

410
00:16:44,841 --> 00:16:46,441
than notches on my bedpost.

411
00:16:47,242 --> 00:16:48,609
Tell me something honestly.

412
00:16:48,611 --> 00:16:52,213
Do you think that it is too late

413
00:16:52,215 --> 00:16:53,448
for me to have kids?

414
00:16:53,450 --> 00:16:56,751
Well, you need a wife first
or at least a girlfriend.

415
00:16:56,753 --> 00:16:58,686
What about...
Not Jan.

416
00:16:58,688 --> 00:16:59,954
Jan.
Okay.

417
00:16:59,956 --> 00:17:01,022
If you really wanna have kids,

418
00:17:01,024 --> 00:17:03,958
I guess you could somehow.

419
00:17:06,295 --> 00:17:08,563
Foster parent or something.

420
00:17:10,866 --> 00:17:12,433
Or biologically.

421
00:17:13,202 --> 00:17:14,602
Somehow.

422
00:17:15,804 --> 00:17:17,004
Thanks, that's...

423
00:17:17,006 --> 00:17:19,240
No, that really
means a lot to me.

424
00:17:22,511 --> 00:17:24,712
Hey, does Sasha
have a godfather?

425
00:17:24,714 --> 00:17:25,780
Because...
Yes.

426
00:17:25,782 --> 00:17:27,381
Okay.

427
00:17:29,518 --> 00:17:30,551
Is it okay if I take one?

428
00:17:30,553 --> 00:17:31,919
Sure.

429
00:17:31,921 --> 00:17:34,388
Thank you.
You're welcome.

430
00:17:34,390 --> 00:17:36,190
Is your job hard?

431
00:17:37,559 --> 00:17:38,693
It's not too bad.

432
00:17:39,428 --> 00:17:40,862
I get to shred things sometimes.

433
00:17:40,864 --> 00:17:41,863
Do you wanna see?

434
00:17:41,865 --> 00:17:43,364
Yeah.

435
00:17:43,366 --> 00:17:44,899
Really?
Yeah.

436
00:17:44,901 --> 00:17:47,001
Okay.

437
00:17:47,003 --> 00:17:50,505
Um, here it is.

438
00:17:50,507 --> 00:17:52,974
Don't put your fingers in there.

439
00:17:55,210 --> 00:17:56,344
Cool, huh?
That's so cool.

440
00:17:56,346 --> 00:17:58,212
Yeah.

441
00:17:58,214 --> 00:18:00,214
Yeah, I get to do this,
like, every week.

442
00:18:00,216 --> 00:18:01,249
That's so awesome.

443
00:18:01,251 --> 00:18:03,484
Yes, it is true.

444
00:18:03,486 --> 00:18:06,320
I, Michael Scott, am signing up

445
00:18:06,322 --> 00:18:08,422
with an online dating service.

446
00:18:08,424 --> 00:18:09,824
Thousands of people
have done it,

447
00:18:09,826 --> 00:18:11,726
and I am going to do it.

448
00:18:11,728 --> 00:18:13,794
I need a user name.

449
00:18:13,796 --> 00:18:15,429
And I have a great one.

450
00:18:19,868 --> 00:18:21,869
Littlekidlover.

451
00:18:21,871 --> 00:18:23,304
That was people will know

452
00:18:23,306 --> 00:18:25,673
exactly where
my priorities are at.

453
00:18:28,810 --> 00:18:30,745
Go ahead.

454
00:18:30,747 --> 00:18:32,980
Do you wanna come over
for dinner tonight?

455
00:18:32,982 --> 00:18:35,683
Oh man, I would love to.

456
00:18:35,685 --> 00:18:38,786
I can't tonight, but can I
come over some other time?

457
00:18:38,788 --> 00:18:41,055
What are you doing?
You never have plans.

458
00:18:41,057 --> 00:18:43,558
Thanks, Kev.

459
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:44,959
Um, I'm actually going
on a date.

460
00:18:44,961 --> 00:18:46,594
Nice.

461
00:18:47,329 --> 00:18:48,963
Hey, uh, no, please.

462
00:18:48,965 --> 00:18:50,164
You can't leave yet.

463
00:18:50,166 --> 00:18:51,832
There's still one more thing
we need to do.

464
00:19:20,230 --> 00:19:21,762
Why does he own a guitar
if he doesn't

465
00:19:21,764 --> 00:19:22,964
know how to play it?

466
00:19:22,966 --> 00:19:26,234
I think he thought his ukulele
skills would transfer.

467
00:19:32,942 --> 00:19:34,408
My theory is that...

468
00:19:59,068 --> 00:20:00,201
And they do.

469
00:20:00,203 --> 00:20:02,036
Your parents love you very much.

470
00:20:02,038 --> 00:20:03,037
One more time.

471
00:20:05,942 --> 00:20:07,375
The Schroots considered
children very valuable.

472
00:20:07,377 --> 00:20:08,776
In the olden days

473
00:20:08,778 --> 00:20:10,745
the women would bear
many children

474
00:20:10,747 --> 00:20:13,147
so we would have enough laborers
to work the fields.

475
00:20:13,149 --> 00:20:15,182
And if it was an especially
cold winter

476
00:20:15,184 --> 00:20:17,918
and there weren't enough
grains or vegetables,

477
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:21,489
they would eat
the weakest of the brood.

478
00:20:21,491 --> 00:20:22,523
No!

479
00:20:22,525 --> 00:20:24,659
They didn't eat the children.

480
00:20:24,661 --> 00:20:26,727
It never came to that.
