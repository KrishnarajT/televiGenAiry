1
00:00:04,742 --> 00:00:08,310
So, uh, have you found
a band yet for your wedding?

2
00:00:08,312 --> 00:00:10,579
No.
'Cause I'm in a band.

3
00:00:10,581 --> 00:00:12,414
We really rock.

4
00:00:12,416 --> 00:00:13,749
Yeah.
I mean, it's inevitable.

5
00:00:13,751 --> 00:00:15,617
I definitely overhear
some wedding preparation,

6
00:00:15,619 --> 00:00:17,052
but I'm fine with it.

7
00:00:17,054 --> 00:00:20,656
She hears me arranging
my social life,

8
00:00:20,658 --> 00:00:22,558
and we both have to hear
Dwight order deer urine

9
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:23,859
over the Internet,

10
00:00:23,861 --> 00:00:25,494
so it evens out.

11
00:00:25,496 --> 00:00:27,496
So I got the Save The Date.
Yeah?

12
00:00:27,498 --> 00:00:28,497
Yeah, pretty stationery.

13
00:00:28,499 --> 00:00:29,631
Oh, thanks.

14
00:00:29,633 --> 00:00:31,166
I didn't get mine yet.

15
00:00:33,937 --> 00:00:35,204
Um...

16
00:00:35,206 --> 00:00:38,740
There are a few people
I decided not to invite,

17
00:00:38,742 --> 00:00:42,744
and that might make things
kind of awkward, but...

18
00:00:42,746 --> 00:00:43,812
it's my wedding.

19
00:00:43,814 --> 00:00:48,817
And I don't want anyone there
who has called me a hussy.

20
00:01:20,950 --> 00:01:22,684
Yes, thanks.

21
00:01:22,686 --> 00:01:24,987
Fantastic Sam's.
Adult cut plus.

22
00:01:24,989 --> 00:01:28,290
Comes with a shampoo
and blow-dry.

23
00:01:28,292 --> 00:01:30,159
We're doing I.D. photos today.

24
00:01:30,161 --> 00:01:32,161
Gotta represent.

25
00:01:32,163 --> 00:01:34,029
Uh, on or off?

26
00:01:34,031 --> 00:01:35,097
Off.

27
00:01:35,099 --> 00:01:36,331
Okay.

28
00:01:36,333 --> 00:01:39,101
Oh! What is on your face?

29
00:01:39,103 --> 00:01:40,669
Is that a disguise?

30
00:01:41,471 --> 00:01:42,671
Excuse me.

31
00:01:44,007 --> 00:01:45,807
Clown paint.

32
00:01:45,809 --> 00:01:47,409
I.D. badges are long overdue.

33
00:01:47,411 --> 00:01:49,778
Security in this office park
is a joke.

34
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:53,482
Last year I came to work with
my spud gun in a duffel bag.

35
00:01:53,484 --> 00:01:56,919
I sat at my desk all day with
a rifle that shoots potatoes

36
00:01:56,921 --> 00:01:59,288
at 60 pounds per square inch.

37
00:01:59,290 --> 00:02:02,291
Can you imagine
if I was deranged?

38
00:02:02,293 --> 00:02:03,992
That's a nice tie.

39
00:02:06,563 --> 00:02:08,897
Thank you.
That is...

40
00:02:08,899 --> 00:02:10,732
Who makes that?
Um, I don't know.

41
00:02:10,734 --> 00:02:12,634
Do you mind if I wear that
for the photo?

42
00:02:12,636 --> 00:02:14,770
Uh, let's, um...

43
00:02:14,772 --> 00:02:17,105
Let's keep our clothes.

44
00:02:17,107 --> 00:02:18,840
It's like child abuse!

45
00:02:20,009 --> 00:02:23,178
I say if Jesus saw that,
he'd freak out!

46
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:25,814
He'd freak out, Toby,
I mean, on so many levels.

47
00:02:25,816 --> 00:02:27,983
And I'm supposed to work there!
I'm supposed...

48
00:02:27,985 --> 00:02:29,685
What's the dealio?

49
00:02:29,687 --> 00:02:31,620
Just letting Oscar
vent a little.

50
00:02:31,622 --> 00:02:32,821
We would use the break room,

51
00:02:32,823 --> 00:02:34,156
but the photographer's
back there.

52
00:02:34,158 --> 00:02:35,290
What's the problem?

53
00:02:35,292 --> 00:02:36,358
Angela.

54
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,392
There's just a little dispute

55
00:02:37,394 --> 00:02:39,895
over a poster
in their workspace.

56
00:02:39,897 --> 00:02:41,396
Since Christmas.

57
00:02:41,398 --> 00:02:43,131
So what, you're having
a little spat?

58
00:02:43,133 --> 00:02:44,233
I forget.
Are you guys dating?

59
00:02:44,235 --> 00:02:45,634
No.

60
00:02:45,636 --> 00:02:48,904
Michael, can I talk to you
for a second, please? Yes.

61
00:02:48,906 --> 00:02:50,439
Here's how
I usually handle this.

62
00:02:50,441 --> 00:02:51,773
All I do is listen.

63
00:02:51,775 --> 00:02:54,109
These things just have a way
of working themselves out.

64
00:02:54,111 --> 00:02:56,411
It's like if you
write someone a letter

65
00:02:56,413 --> 00:02:57,613
when you're really angry.

66
00:02:57,615 --> 00:02:59,481
They say to keep it in
your drawer for a couple days,

67
00:02:59,483 --> 00:03:01,617
and then you just never
end up sending it.

68
00:03:01,619 --> 00:03:03,719
What do you know about
conflict resolution?

69
00:03:03,721 --> 00:03:06,521
Your answer to everything
is to get divorced, so...

70
00:03:06,523 --> 00:03:07,889
Okay.
Okay, what?

71
00:03:07,891 --> 00:03:09,758
That was a right decision
for me and my marriage.

72
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:12,261
Well, that's not gonna fly here
because in this office,

73
00:03:12,263 --> 00:03:13,996
it is till death do us part,

74
00:03:13,998 --> 00:03:15,998
assuming that we don't
get downsized.

75
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,667
Uh, Pam, would you get Angela

76
00:03:18,669 --> 00:03:21,336
and meet us in
the conference room, please?

77
00:03:21,338 --> 00:03:24,539
A Mediator's Toolchest.

78
00:03:26,309 --> 00:03:28,977
Okay, well,
before we get started,

79
00:03:28,979 --> 00:03:30,545
you should know that there are

80
00:03:30,547 --> 00:03:33,649
five different styles
of conflict.

81
00:03:33,651 --> 00:03:37,719
My Shaolin Temple style
defeats your Monkey style.

82
00:03:37,721 --> 00:03:39,554
Can we go?
I have a lot of work to do.

83
00:03:39,556 --> 00:03:40,822
No. This is important.

84
00:03:40,824 --> 00:03:43,258
Okay, the first style is
"lose-lose."

85
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:46,828
What's the next one?
Just hold on, please.

86
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:49,298
Okay, if we do lose-lose,

87
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:52,301
neither of you
gets what you want.

88
00:03:52,303 --> 00:03:53,435
Do you understand?

89
00:03:56,105 --> 00:03:58,307
You would both lose.

90
00:03:58,309 --> 00:03:59,775
Now, I need to ask you,

91
00:03:59,777 --> 00:04:04,313
do you want to pursue
a lose-lose negotiation?

92
00:04:04,315 --> 00:04:07,249
Can we just skip
to whatever number five is?

93
00:04:07,251 --> 00:04:08,517
Win-win or whatever?

94
00:04:08,519 --> 00:04:11,086
Win-win is number four,

95
00:04:11,088 --> 00:04:13,822
and number five is
win-win-win.

96
00:04:13,824 --> 00:04:15,691
The important difference here is

97
00:04:15,693 --> 00:04:17,826
with win-win-win,
we all win.

98
00:04:17,828 --> 00:04:21,463
Me too. I win for having
successfully mediated

99
00:04:21,465 --> 00:04:23,699
a conflict at work.

100
00:04:23,701 --> 00:04:27,069
Okay, so this is
the disputed poster.

101
00:04:27,071 --> 00:04:29,104
Now, one at a time,

102
00:04:29,106 --> 00:04:32,007
I want you
to express your feelings

103
00:04:32,009 --> 00:04:35,210
using "I" emotion language

104
00:04:35,212 --> 00:04:38,547
and no judging,
or "you" statements.

105
00:04:38,549 --> 00:04:40,349
I got this poster for Christmas,

106
00:04:40,351 --> 00:04:42,617
and I feel I want
to see it every day.

107
00:04:42,619 --> 00:04:45,854
It makes me feel like the
babies are the true artists,

108
00:04:45,856 --> 00:04:47,923
and God has a really cute
sense of humor.

109
00:04:47,925 --> 00:04:49,257
Come on, seriously.
That?

110
00:04:49,259 --> 00:04:51,059
I don't like looking at it.

111
00:04:51,061 --> 00:04:54,229
It's creepy and in bad taste,
and it's just offensive to me.

112
00:04:54,231 --> 00:04:57,332
It makes me think of the
horrible, frigid stage mothers

113
00:04:57,334 --> 00:04:59,034
who forced the babies into it.

114
00:04:59,036 --> 00:05:01,370
It's kitsch.
It's the opposite of art.

115
00:05:01,372 --> 00:05:03,672
It destroys art.
It destroys souls.

116
00:05:03,674 --> 00:05:05,974
This is so much more offensive
to me than hard-core porno.

117
00:05:05,976 --> 00:05:07,242
Okay, okay, okay!
Oh, my God.

118
00:05:07,244 --> 00:05:08,810
Stop, stop, stop!

119
00:05:08,812 --> 00:05:11,246
Let's see if we can't
just brainstorm

120
00:05:11,248 --> 00:05:14,516
and find some creative
alternatives that are win-win.

121
00:05:14,518 --> 00:05:16,518
Win. Yes. Thank you, Pam.

122
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:20,288
How about Angela makes
the poster into a t-shirt,

123
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:22,257
which Oscar wears.

124
00:05:22,259 --> 00:05:24,059
That way he can never see it,

125
00:05:24,061 --> 00:05:26,294
and whenever she looks at Oscar,

126
00:05:26,296 --> 00:05:27,863
she can see it.

127
00:05:27,865 --> 00:05:29,531
Win-win-win.

128
00:05:29,533 --> 00:05:31,600
No. That's... No.

129
00:05:31,602 --> 00:05:33,101
Okay, well, brainstorm.
Own the solution.

130
00:05:33,103 --> 00:05:34,836
How about I leave it up?

131
00:05:34,838 --> 00:05:36,204
How about she takes it down?

132
00:05:36,206 --> 00:05:38,874
How about Angela can keep it up

133
00:05:38,876 --> 00:05:41,176
on Tuesdays and Thursdays. Okay.

134
00:05:41,178 --> 00:05:43,912
That is called a compromise,

135
00:05:43,914 --> 00:05:46,214
and it is style three,

136
00:05:46,216 --> 00:05:47,249
and it is not ideal.

137
00:05:47,251 --> 00:05:48,417
To sum up,

138
00:05:48,419 --> 00:05:51,186
win-win, make the poster
into a t-shirt.

139
00:05:51,188 --> 00:05:53,622
Win-lose,
take the poster down.

140
00:05:53,624 --> 00:05:55,457
Compromise,
Tuesdays and Thursdays.

141
00:05:55,459 --> 00:05:57,659
And the answer is...

142
00:05:58,761 --> 00:06:00,829
make the poster
into a t-shirt.

143
00:06:00,831 --> 00:06:02,364
Win-win.
Win.

144
00:06:02,366 --> 00:06:03,432
Fine.
But...

145
00:06:03,434 --> 00:06:06,134
It is done!

146
00:06:08,171 --> 00:06:09,471
No, you're all good.

147
00:06:09,473 --> 00:06:10,539
Great.

148
00:06:15,178 --> 00:06:18,947
Hey, Angela.
I didn't have your zip code.

149
00:06:18,949 --> 00:06:21,450
Oh, thanks.

150
00:06:22,652 --> 00:06:24,386
It was hand-delivered,

151
00:06:24,388 --> 00:06:27,689
but I did get
a Save The Date after all.

152
00:06:27,691 --> 00:06:29,825
It's not my taste.

153
00:06:29,827 --> 00:06:31,126
You solved it.

154
00:06:31,128 --> 00:06:32,260
Yes.

155
00:06:32,262 --> 00:06:35,464
Well, good.
We can throw that one out.

156
00:06:36,766 --> 00:06:38,667
Are those all the other complaints?
Mm-hmm.

157
00:06:38,669 --> 00:06:40,068
I would like to see those,
please.

158
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:42,070
I... I can't do that.

159
00:06:42,072 --> 00:06:45,173
You can't do that, huh?
Okay.

160
00:06:45,175 --> 00:06:46,942
Now you and I have a conflict.

161
00:06:46,944 --> 00:06:49,211
I order you
to give me that file.

162
00:06:49,213 --> 00:06:50,345
That...

163
00:06:51,614 --> 00:06:52,681
Okay.

164
00:06:54,951 --> 00:06:57,486
There!
No more conflict.

165
00:06:57,488 --> 00:07:00,055
I had to use win-lose on that.
It was not pretty.

166
00:07:00,057 --> 00:07:01,756
All right.
Is that it?

167
00:07:08,464 --> 00:07:09,898
It's all Dwight's.

168
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:11,633
Every Friday at 4:00,

169
00:07:11,635 --> 00:07:13,435
I have a standing appointment
with Dwight

170
00:07:13,437 --> 00:07:15,704
for him to file a grievance
against Jim.

171
00:07:15,706 --> 00:07:16,938
I tell him that I'm sending them

172
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:18,874
to a special file in New York.

173
00:07:18,876 --> 00:07:20,342
That box is the...

174
00:07:20,344 --> 00:07:21,843
Special file in New York.

175
00:07:21,845 --> 00:07:24,679
Oh, God.
All right.

176
00:07:24,681 --> 00:07:27,082
Why do I have to do everything?

177
00:07:27,084 --> 00:07:28,149
Are you sure?

178
00:07:28,151 --> 00:07:30,819
Oh, he's sure.
Just shoot.

179
00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:36,324
This is from Kevin.

180
00:07:36,326 --> 00:07:39,761
He says Stanley uses his
Miracle Whip without asking.

181
00:07:39,763 --> 00:07:42,898
Meredith complains that
everyone talks too loud

182
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:43,965
in the morning,

183
00:07:43,967 --> 00:07:46,067
and the lights are too bright.

184
00:07:46,069 --> 00:07:49,304
Creed...

185
00:07:49,306 --> 00:07:52,274
Creed is sick of looking
at the redhead all day

186
00:07:52,276 --> 00:07:55,410
and wants a seat facing
the receptionist.

187
00:07:55,412 --> 00:07:57,245
Nice.

188
00:07:57,247 --> 00:08:01,449
You will notice that not one of
these complaints is against me.

189
00:08:01,451 --> 00:08:03,051
Actually,
I have a separate folder

190
00:08:03,053 --> 00:08:04,986
for complaints against Michael.

191
00:08:04,988 --> 00:08:11,159
This is January through March
of this year.

192
00:08:13,696 --> 00:08:16,731
How many of you have at one time

193
00:08:16,733 --> 00:08:19,534
gone to Toby to complain
about another employee?

194
00:08:21,971 --> 00:08:23,305
And did you get what you wanted,

195
00:08:23,307 --> 00:08:27,042
or were you merely listened to,
you forget about your problem,

196
00:08:27,044 --> 00:08:28,076
and you move on?

197
00:08:28,078 --> 00:08:31,813
That is outrageous!

198
00:08:31,815 --> 00:08:33,448
I love this place,

199
00:08:33,450 --> 00:08:35,483
and it pains me to see

200
00:08:35,485 --> 00:08:39,888
all of the negativity
festering...

201
00:08:39,890 --> 00:08:41,256
Okay.

202
00:08:41,258 --> 00:08:45,627
Today we are going to get
everything out of these files

203
00:08:45,629 --> 00:08:48,597
and into the open,
where it can be resolved.

204
00:08:48,599 --> 00:08:51,766
All right, how about
the Phyllis-Angela dispute?

205
00:08:51,768 --> 00:08:53,134
You already did me.

206
00:08:53,136 --> 00:08:54,669
That's what she said.

207
00:08:54,671 --> 00:08:55,804
The thing is, Angela,

208
00:08:55,806 --> 00:08:58,974
you are in here an awful lot.

209
00:08:58,976 --> 00:09:00,742
You have complained
about everybody in the office,

210
00:09:00,744 --> 00:09:03,345
except Dwight, which is odd

211
00:09:03,347 --> 00:09:05,847
because everyone else has
had run-ins with Dwight.

212
00:09:05,849 --> 00:09:08,350
Toby, by the way,
what does "redacted" mean?

213
00:09:08,352 --> 00:09:10,385
There is a file full
of complaints in here

214
00:09:10,387 --> 00:09:11,820
marked "redacted."

215
00:09:11,822 --> 00:09:13,121
Yeah, it just means
whoever complained

216
00:09:13,123 --> 00:09:14,356
came to me later
and withdrew it,

217
00:09:14,358 --> 00:09:16,091
so I took their name off.

218
00:09:16,093 --> 00:09:17,292
Okay.

219
00:09:17,294 --> 00:09:19,961
There were a bunch of complaints
about Dwight

220
00:09:19,963 --> 00:09:22,297
that were put in the redacted
file about six months ago.

221
00:09:22,299 --> 00:09:23,331
Wait!

222
00:09:23,333 --> 00:09:25,100
If someone has
a problem with me,

223
00:09:25,102 --> 00:09:27,202
why would they withdraw it
six months ago?

224
00:09:29,672 --> 00:09:32,607
Um...
Let's move on.

225
00:09:32,609 --> 00:09:33,875
I volunteer.

226
00:09:33,877 --> 00:09:35,410
Did anyone have a problem
with me?

227
00:09:35,412 --> 00:09:38,246
All right, Pamela.
Come on down!

228
00:09:38,248 --> 00:09:39,948
Let's do it.

229
00:09:39,950 --> 00:09:43,251
And... okay.
Just one complaint.

230
00:09:43,253 --> 00:09:45,787
Actually, it has been withdrawn.

231
00:09:45,789 --> 00:09:47,088
So that is no help to us.

232
00:09:47,090 --> 00:09:48,923
Next.
Wait, what did it say?

233
00:09:48,925 --> 00:09:51,926
Uh, "Does she have to plan
her wedding on office time?

234
00:09:51,928 --> 00:09:53,061
Shouldn't she do that
at home?"

235
00:09:54,664 --> 00:09:56,731
Who else?

236
00:09:56,733 --> 00:09:58,466
Why don't we just warm up first?

237
00:09:58,468 --> 00:10:00,135
Warm up emotionally, all right?

238
00:10:00,137 --> 00:10:02,437
I have this kind of big secret
about Angela.

239
00:10:02,439 --> 00:10:03,972
And I've been
really nice to her,

240
00:10:03,974 --> 00:10:06,708
and I haven't told anyone,
and...

241
00:10:06,710 --> 00:10:07,842
What the hell?

242
00:10:07,844 --> 00:10:10,512
Here is a Kelly complaint.

243
00:10:10,514 --> 00:10:12,647
"Ryan never returns
my calls."

244
00:10:12,649 --> 00:10:14,549
Ah.
Join the club.

245
00:10:14,551 --> 00:10:17,152
My voice mail's
real spotty... sometimes.

246
00:10:17,154 --> 00:10:19,954
I didn't file a complaint.
I was just talking.

247
00:10:19,956 --> 00:10:21,456
To your HR representative.

248
00:10:21,458 --> 00:10:22,991
To my friend, I thought.

249
00:10:22,993 --> 00:10:24,459
I want that withdrawn.

250
00:10:24,461 --> 00:10:26,161
Fine, I'll take your name off.

251
00:10:26,163 --> 00:10:27,495
So no one will know.

252
00:10:29,633 --> 00:10:31,099
Making progress.

253
00:10:31,101 --> 00:10:32,434
Yes.
Dwight tried to kiss me.

254
00:10:32,436 --> 00:10:33,868
What?
And I didn't tell anyone

255
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:35,470
'cause I'm not really sure
how I feel about it.

256
00:10:35,472 --> 00:10:38,073
That is not true.
Redact it. Redact it!

257
00:10:38,075 --> 00:10:39,641
Well, I'm not actually making
a formal complaint.

258
00:10:39,643 --> 00:10:41,476
I just really think
we should talk about it.

259
00:10:41,478 --> 00:10:42,677
Okay, question.

260
00:10:42,679 --> 00:10:44,345
When a name is withdrawn,
does that also apply

261
00:10:44,347 --> 00:10:47,582
to the permanent
misbehavior file in New York?

262
00:10:47,584 --> 00:10:48,750
Sure.

263
00:10:49,852 --> 00:10:51,419
Stanley.

264
00:10:51,421 --> 00:10:52,787
Hey.
A lot of anger under there...

265
00:10:52,789 --> 00:10:54,522
Thanks for ratting me out.

266
00:10:54,524 --> 00:10:55,557
I didn't do it.

267
00:10:55,559 --> 00:10:56,825
I find that hard to believe,

268
00:10:56,827 --> 00:10:58,660
considering you have problems
with every single person

269
00:10:58,662 --> 00:11:02,964
in this entire office
except Bobblehead Joe.

270
00:11:02,966 --> 00:11:06,434
Someone complained
that the men's room

271
00:11:06,436 --> 00:11:08,303
is "whites only."

272
00:11:08,305 --> 00:11:10,171
Stanley, you know
that's not true.

273
00:11:10,173 --> 00:11:12,006
I didn't say that.

274
00:11:12,008 --> 00:11:14,175
Then why is there a picture
of a white man on the door?

275
00:11:18,814 --> 00:11:20,181
Okay, Phyllis.

276
00:11:20,183 --> 00:11:22,784
You complained that Angela
is giving you dirty looks.

277
00:11:22,786 --> 00:11:24,986
And you tried to get off
the party planning committee.

278
00:11:24,988 --> 00:11:26,855
No, I never said any such thing.

279
00:11:26,857 --> 00:11:28,523
Angela and I are close.

280
00:11:28,525 --> 00:11:29,758
And... also, Phyllis,

281
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:32,761
Stanley says that you
cry too much,

282
00:11:32,763 --> 00:11:33,828
and that bugs him.

283
00:11:33,830 --> 00:11:35,497
Stanley and I are close, too.

284
00:11:35,499 --> 00:11:38,399
- We sit close.
- Okaaay.

285
00:11:40,369 --> 00:11:43,171
Just take it.

286
00:11:43,173 --> 00:11:45,673
I can't believe Angela.

287
00:11:45,675 --> 00:11:46,975
I went against
my better judgment,

288
00:11:46,977 --> 00:11:48,777
and I gave her a Save The Date.

289
00:11:48,779 --> 00:11:51,146
And now it turns out
she complained about me to Toby.

290
00:11:51,148 --> 00:11:52,680
Well, it was redacted.

291
00:11:53,749 --> 00:11:55,250
Look, if she wants an invite,

292
00:11:55,252 --> 00:11:56,751
maybe she's just trying
to be friends.

293
00:11:56,753 --> 00:11:58,686
Don't take her side.

294
00:12:01,190 --> 00:12:02,757
Well, what does Roy think
about everything?

295
00:12:02,759 --> 00:12:05,393
I try not to bother him
about this kind of stuff.

296
00:12:05,395 --> 00:12:07,495
You mean like your thoughts
and feelings?

297
00:12:07,497 --> 00:12:08,563
Yeah.

298
00:12:09,765 --> 00:12:11,733
I know you keep saying
it's your space,

299
00:12:11,735 --> 00:12:13,001
even though
there's no assigned parking,

300
00:12:13,003 --> 00:12:14,068
but I keep forgetting.

301
00:12:14,070 --> 00:12:15,436
Yes, that's the problem.

302
00:12:15,438 --> 00:12:16,604
I guess so.

303
00:12:17,606 --> 00:12:20,208
Okay, well.
All settled, then.

304
00:12:21,811 --> 00:12:24,312
I don't like you.

305
00:12:24,314 --> 00:12:26,314
Okay, Ryan, you told Toby

306
00:12:26,316 --> 00:12:32,020
that Creed has a distinct
old man smell?

307
00:12:32,022 --> 00:12:33,988
I know exactly
what he's talking about.

308
00:12:33,990 --> 00:12:36,324
I sprout mung beans
on a damp paper towel

309
00:12:36,326 --> 00:12:37,458
in my desk drawer.

310
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:39,027
Very nutritious.

311
00:12:39,029 --> 00:12:40,562
But they smell like death.

312
00:12:40,564 --> 00:12:41,963
All right, Kevin.

313
00:12:41,965 --> 00:12:43,031
You are accused of making

314
00:12:43,033 --> 00:12:45,567
sexually suggestive
remarks to Angela

315
00:12:45,569 --> 00:12:47,302
that made her feel
uncomfortable.

316
00:12:47,304 --> 00:12:48,803
Solution.

317
00:12:48,805 --> 00:12:50,338
Angela, you are to make

318
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:52,207
sexually suggestive
remarks to Kevin

319
00:12:52,209 --> 00:12:53,241
that will make him
uncomfortable.

320
00:12:53,243 --> 00:12:54,976
I accept your decision.

321
00:12:56,947 --> 00:13:00,315
Hey, you know what, Dwight? Maybe we
should get our photo I.D. taken together.

322
00:13:00,317 --> 00:13:01,816
That doesn't make any sense.

323
00:13:01,818 --> 00:13:03,284
Well, it saves time, you know.

324
00:13:03,286 --> 00:13:04,419
'Cause we could just meet

325
00:13:04,421 --> 00:13:05,486
in the parking lot
every morning.

326
00:13:05,488 --> 00:13:07,155
Walk in together.
Perfect.

327
00:13:07,157 --> 00:13:08,156
Smile.

328
00:13:08,158 --> 00:13:09,958
No.

329
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:11,459
I never smile if I can help it.

330
00:13:11,461 --> 00:13:12,493
Showing one's teeth

331
00:13:12,495 --> 00:13:14,529
is a submission signal
in primates.

332
00:13:14,531 --> 00:13:16,664
When someone smiles at me,
all I see

333
00:13:16,666 --> 00:13:18,900
is a chimpanzee
begging for its life.

334
00:13:21,403 --> 00:13:24,072
This came out really well.

335
00:13:24,074 --> 00:13:25,440
There you go.

336
00:13:29,979 --> 00:13:31,446
This is humongous.

337
00:13:31,448 --> 00:13:33,481
I am not a security threat.
Oh.

338
00:13:33,483 --> 00:13:35,650
And my middle name is Kurt.

339
00:13:35,652 --> 00:13:37,318
Not Fart.

340
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:39,754
What did I write?

341
00:13:42,358 --> 00:13:44,759
I have another complaint
for Jim's permanent file.

342
00:13:44,761 --> 00:13:47,795
Talk to Michael.
I gave him the box.

343
00:13:47,797 --> 00:13:49,163
What box?

344
00:13:51,667 --> 00:13:53,134
But I didn't report your
snoring... Wednesdays, tearful.

345
00:13:53,136 --> 00:13:56,404
Tuesdays...
Okay.

346
00:13:56,406 --> 00:13:58,873
Ah... agh... dgh... dah! Dwight.

347
00:13:58,875 --> 00:14:01,809
No, no!

348
00:14:01,811 --> 00:14:03,244
Four years of malfeasance
unreported.

349
00:14:03,246 --> 00:14:04,979
This cannot stand.
Okay. Calm down.

350
00:14:04,981 --> 00:14:06,514
No, you calm down.
Whose side is Toby on?

351
00:14:06,516 --> 00:14:07,649
Whose side are you on?

352
00:14:07,651 --> 00:14:09,217
Hey, hey!
Him or me?

353
00:14:09,219 --> 00:14:10,485
Him or me?

354
00:14:10,487 --> 00:14:11,853
I cannot work with Jim anymore.
Okay.

355
00:14:11,855 --> 00:14:12,987
Either he goes, or I go.

356
00:14:12,989 --> 00:14:14,188
Dwight, stop...
You choose!

357
00:14:14,190 --> 00:14:16,557
One of us is out of here
by the end of today.

358
00:14:20,462 --> 00:14:21,529
Okay.

359
00:14:23,532 --> 00:14:24,666
I am not bluffing!

360
00:14:24,668 --> 00:14:25,867
Okay, yes.
Okay?

361
00:14:25,869 --> 00:14:27,001
Do the right thing here,
Michael.

362
00:14:27,003 --> 00:14:29,470
I have served you loyally
for years.

363
00:14:29,472 --> 00:14:31,539
I deserve this, you know I do!

364
00:14:33,008 --> 00:14:37,445
You know your I.D. says
you're a security threat?

365
00:14:37,447 --> 00:14:39,113
You have till 5:00.

366
00:14:43,319 --> 00:14:44,953
Oh, look, Jim.

367
00:14:44,955 --> 00:14:48,690
There's a sales manager
position open in Stamford.

368
00:14:48,692 --> 00:14:51,626
Want me to call Jan
and tell her you're interested?

369
00:14:51,628 --> 00:14:53,828
I could put in
a good word for you.

370
00:14:53,830 --> 00:14:55,630
'Cause I'll still
be working here.

371
00:14:55,632 --> 00:14:58,733
Trans-fer,
trans-fer... Everybody.

372
00:14:58,735 --> 00:15:01,369
Trans-fer, trans-fer
trans-fer!

373
00:15:01,371 --> 00:15:05,106
Okay, you two,
in the conference room, with me.

374
00:15:05,108 --> 00:15:09,043
Nobody leaves until
we work this out.

375
00:15:09,045 --> 00:15:10,912
Cage match.

376
00:15:10,914 --> 00:15:12,547
Cage matches?
Yeah, they work.

377
00:15:12,549 --> 00:15:13,815
How could they not work?

378
00:15:13,817 --> 00:15:14,882
If they didn't work,

379
00:15:14,884 --> 00:15:17,285
everybody would still
be in the cage.

380
00:15:17,287 --> 00:15:18,953
Okay, so, Dwight,
in your own words.

381
00:15:18,955 --> 00:15:22,123
"Someone replaced all my pens
and pencils with crayons.

382
00:15:22,125 --> 00:15:24,425
I suspect Jim Halpert."

383
00:15:24,427 --> 00:15:27,195
"Everyone has
called me Dwayne all day.

384
00:15:27,197 --> 00:15:29,530
I think Jim Halpert
paid them to."

385
00:15:30,667 --> 00:15:32,867
Yes, five bucks each.

386
00:15:32,869 --> 00:15:34,569
And it was totally worth it.

387
00:15:34,571 --> 00:15:37,705
"This morning I found a bloody
glove in my desk drawer,

388
00:15:37,707 --> 00:15:40,074
"and Jim Halpert
tried to convince me

389
00:15:40,076 --> 00:15:41,309
"I committed murder.

390
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:43,544
I think he may be
the real murderer."

391
00:15:43,546 --> 00:15:45,880
"Jim Halpert said there was
an abandoned infant

392
00:15:45,882 --> 00:15:46,914
"in the women's room.

393
00:15:46,916 --> 00:15:48,683
"When I went to save the child,

394
00:15:48,685 --> 00:15:50,218
I saw Meredith on the can."

395
00:15:50,953 --> 00:15:52,020
Gad.

396
00:15:53,255 --> 00:15:57,658
"This morning I knocked myself
in the head with the phone."

397
00:15:59,228 --> 00:16:00,762
That actually took a while.

398
00:16:00,764 --> 00:16:03,531
I had to put more and more
nickels into his handset,

399
00:16:03,533 --> 00:16:05,266
till he got used to the weight,

400
00:16:05,268 --> 00:16:08,002
and then I just...
took 'em all out.

401
00:16:08,004 --> 00:16:10,471
"Every time I typed my name

402
00:16:10,473 --> 00:16:12,240
it said Diapers."

403
00:16:13,542 --> 00:16:15,910
Just a simple macro.

404
00:16:15,912 --> 00:16:19,013
You know, these actually
don't sound that funny

405
00:16:19,015 --> 00:16:20,048
one after another.

406
00:16:20,050 --> 00:16:22,483
But he does deserve it, though.

407
00:16:22,485 --> 00:16:24,018
"By the end of the day,

408
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:26,187
my desk was about two feet
closer to the copier."

409
00:16:27,423 --> 00:16:29,490
Yeah, I just moved it an inch

410
00:16:29,492 --> 00:16:31,025
every time he went
to the bathroom.

411
00:16:32,161 --> 00:16:34,729
And that's how I spent
my entire day that day.

412
00:16:58,020 --> 00:17:02,023
The Japanese have this thing
called shiatsu massage,

413
00:17:02,025 --> 00:17:05,593
where they dig into your body,
very hard.

414
00:17:05,595 --> 00:17:06,894
And it is very painful.

415
00:17:06,896 --> 00:17:08,996
And apparently,
some people throw up.

416
00:17:08,998 --> 00:17:11,599
But the next day
they feel great.

417
00:17:11,601 --> 00:17:13,668
I've never had one.

418
00:17:13,670 --> 00:17:15,136
They sound awful.

419
00:17:21,311 --> 00:17:23,244
Maybe Stamford would be cool.

420
00:17:25,414 --> 00:17:27,048
It's a good market.

421
00:17:28,417 --> 00:17:29,717
Higher volume.

422
00:17:30,319 --> 00:17:31,452
Yeah.

423
00:17:33,388 --> 00:17:34,622
Maybe we should both go.

424
00:17:34,624 --> 00:17:36,924
I have a girlfriend.

425
00:17:36,926 --> 00:17:38,960
Sure, you do, Dwight. Sure.

426
00:17:38,962 --> 00:17:42,697
Hey, there's, like,
300 more of these.

427
00:17:42,699 --> 00:17:43,998
Let's get to them later.

428
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,766
So, you gonna
transfer Jim or not?

429
00:17:45,768 --> 00:17:48,002
Maybe. I haven't decided yet.

430
00:17:48,004 --> 00:17:49,003
Let's get to work.

431
00:17:49,005 --> 00:17:50,605
I want an answer by tomorrow.

432
00:17:50,607 --> 00:17:54,175
Okay... ooh, actually,
tomorrow's not good.

433
00:17:54,177 --> 00:17:56,410
How about later in the week?

434
00:17:56,412 --> 00:17:57,879
Fine.

435
00:17:57,881 --> 00:18:00,381
Good. Okay.

436
00:18:04,319 --> 00:18:05,520
Hey! Wait.

437
00:18:05,522 --> 00:18:08,489
How about a group picture
while you're here?

438
00:18:08,491 --> 00:18:10,658
I can't. I only get reimbursed
for the I.D. photos.

439
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:12,627
Well, that's, what,
a computer camera, right?

440
00:18:12,629 --> 00:18:14,195
You mean, digital?

441
00:18:14,197 --> 00:18:16,197
Yeah, it'll take, like,
two seconds.

442
00:18:16,199 --> 00:18:18,166
20 bucks.

443
00:18:18,168 --> 00:18:19,767
All right.

444
00:18:19,769 --> 00:18:23,104
Everybody, come on.
Group photo for the newsletter.

445
00:18:23,106 --> 00:18:24,939
You've gotta be kidding.

446
00:18:24,941 --> 00:18:26,707
Come on, everybody.
Come on, let's go.

447
00:18:26,709 --> 00:18:29,944
Creed, Kevin, Oscar,
andale, let's go.

448
00:18:29,946 --> 00:18:32,513
One, two, three.
Smile.

449
00:18:32,515 --> 00:18:34,048
Try to smile.

450
00:18:34,050 --> 00:18:35,149
We resolved a lot today,
everybody.

451
00:18:35,151 --> 00:18:36,284
Think happy thoughts.

452
00:18:36,286 --> 00:18:37,618
Okay, I'm just gonna
take it on three,

453
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:38,920
whether you smile or not.

454
00:18:38,922 --> 00:18:40,254
One, two, three.

455
00:18:40,256 --> 00:18:41,956
Good. Let's check that out.

456
00:18:41,958 --> 00:18:44,592
Ew, okay, all right.

457
00:18:44,594 --> 00:18:46,093
One more.
We'll take one more.

458
00:18:46,095 --> 00:18:47,261
That'll be another 20.

459
00:18:47,263 --> 00:18:48,663
What?

460
00:18:48,665 --> 00:18:51,165
Angela, I want to talk to
you about something. What?

461
00:18:51,167 --> 00:18:52,266
No, Pam...
I am.

462
00:18:52,268 --> 00:18:53,768
It's about the Save The Date...

463
00:18:53,770 --> 00:18:55,069
Pam, it wasn't her.
What?

464
00:18:56,605 --> 00:18:58,439
I'm the one
who complained about you.

465
00:19:00,475 --> 00:19:04,078
I didn't know that Toby
was gonna write it down.

466
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:06,480
I was just venting.

467
00:19:06,482 --> 00:19:08,549
You know, it was one day.

468
00:19:08,551 --> 00:19:10,051
And I took it right back.

469
00:19:10,053 --> 00:19:11,686
It was like...

470
00:19:13,855 --> 00:19:14,889
Okay.

471
00:19:14,891 --> 00:19:16,424
Oh, dear.

472
00:19:19,328 --> 00:19:22,096
Okay... we can do this.

473
00:19:22,098 --> 00:19:23,397
Come on, everybody.

474
00:19:25,467 --> 00:19:27,001
All right.

475
00:19:27,003 --> 00:19:28,669
Here we go.

476
00:19:28,671 --> 00:19:32,473
It was really hard getting
a good picture of 15 people.

477
00:19:32,475 --> 00:19:34,242
He would not give me a discount.

478
00:19:34,244 --> 00:19:36,210
And eight tries added up.

479
00:19:36,212 --> 00:19:38,646
One, two...

480
00:19:38,648 --> 00:19:40,381
Didn't say three, did I?

481
00:19:40,383 --> 00:19:43,184
But I'm sort of an expert
at Photoshop.

482
00:19:43,186 --> 00:19:45,219
So it turned out fine
in the end.

483
00:19:45,221 --> 00:19:46,587
When people work together,

484
00:19:46,589 --> 00:19:48,389
there is going to be conflict.

485
00:19:48,391 --> 00:19:50,658
You can't outrun your problems.

486
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:52,426
Hey, Pam, it's Jim.

487
00:19:52,428 --> 00:19:54,662
Um, I have a doctor's
appointment in the city.

488
00:19:54,664 --> 00:19:57,198
So I probably won't be in
till the late afternoon.

489
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:00,001
Just thought I'd let ya know.
Okay, bye.

490
00:20:00,003 --> 00:20:02,003
Okay, Jan will see you now.

491
00:20:02,005 --> 00:20:03,337
Oh, thanks.

492
00:20:03,339 --> 00:20:06,107
And that is why the idea
of a cage match

493
00:20:06,109 --> 00:20:08,843
is so universally appealing.

494
00:20:08,845 --> 00:20:11,245
But here's the thing
about cage matches.

495
00:20:11,247 --> 00:20:14,815
Sometimes you have
to open the cage.

496
00:20:14,817 --> 00:20:20,388
And that is something that Toby
will never understand.
