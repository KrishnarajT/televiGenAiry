1
00:00:00,841 --> 00:00:02,975
So...
I'm happy to be here.

2
00:00:02,977 --> 00:00:05,010
It's very nice
to see all of you.

3
00:00:05,012 --> 00:00:06,412
You're all looking well.

4
00:00:06,414 --> 00:00:08,214
Today's a Women
in the Workplace thing.

5
00:00:08,216 --> 00:00:10,282
Jan's coming in from corporate

6
00:00:10,284 --> 00:00:12,718
to talk to all the women
about, um...

7
00:00:14,254 --> 00:00:15,688
I don't really know what.

8
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:17,523
But Michael's not allowed in.

9
00:00:17,525 --> 00:00:19,458
She said that about five times.

10
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:23,095
Women today, though we have
the same options as men,

11
00:00:23,097 --> 00:00:26,198
we often face a very different
set of obstacles...

12
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:28,234
in getting there, so...

13
00:00:28,236 --> 00:00:29,468
Hey, what's going on?

14
00:00:29,470 --> 00:00:31,070
Michael, I...
Yeah, you know what?

15
00:00:31,072 --> 00:00:32,371
I thought we agreed...
I thought about it.

16
00:00:32,373 --> 00:00:34,039
I just have few things
I wanna say.

17
00:00:35,076 --> 00:00:36,242
What are you doing?

18
00:00:36,244 --> 00:00:37,543
Just hear me out.

19
00:00:37,545 --> 00:00:39,478
What is more important
than quality?

20
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:41,380
Equality.

21
00:00:41,382 --> 00:00:43,816
Now, studies show
that today's woman,

22
00:00:43,818 --> 00:00:45,885
the Ally McBeal woman,
as I call her,

23
00:00:45,887 --> 00:00:47,319
is at a crossroads.

24
00:00:47,321 --> 00:00:49,154
Michael...
And... no, just, I...

25
00:00:49,156 --> 00:00:51,056
You have come a long way, baby.

26
00:00:51,058 --> 00:00:52,157
But I just...

27
00:00:52,159 --> 00:00:54,460
just wanna keep it
within reason.

28
00:00:54,462 --> 00:00:55,961
They did this up in Albany...

29
00:00:55,963 --> 00:00:58,063
You are not allowed in... And they
ended up turning the break room

30
00:00:58,065 --> 00:00:59,632
into a lactation room,
which is disgusting.

31
00:00:59,634 --> 00:01:01,567
Now you're really
not allowed in this session.

32
00:01:01,569 --> 00:01:02,968
Well, I'm their boss,
so I feel like...

33
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:04,536
I'm your boss.

34
00:01:09,376 --> 00:01:10,776
Anybody want any coffee
or anything?

35
00:01:10,778 --> 00:01:11,777
We're fine, Michael.

36
00:01:11,779 --> 00:01:12,811
We just need you
to leave, please.

37
00:01:12,813 --> 00:01:14,546
Women in the workplace.

38
00:01:14,548 --> 00:01:16,815
Yeah, translation:

39
00:01:16,817 --> 00:01:18,717
I have been banned
from my own conference room

40
00:01:18,719 --> 00:01:20,920
so that Jan can talk in secret
to all the girls.

41
00:01:20,922 --> 00:01:23,255
Oh, sorry.
"Women of the Workplace."

42
00:01:23,257 --> 00:01:24,456
About what?
I don't know.

43
00:01:24,458 --> 00:01:27,459
Clothes, me...

44
00:01:27,461 --> 00:01:28,560
Ick.

45
00:01:28,562 --> 00:01:30,362
Ladies, I am so,

46
00:01:30,364 --> 00:01:31,797
so sorry.

47
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:34,366
Can we... start again?
We were on such a roll.

48
00:01:34,368 --> 00:01:36,402
I-I really apologize for that.
Jan.

49
00:01:36,404 --> 00:01:37,536
Yes, Pam?

50
00:01:37,538 --> 00:01:38,737
Michael's still at the door.

51
00:01:38,739 --> 00:01:39,939
Michael!

52
00:02:11,972 --> 00:02:14,907
So one obstacle
is how assertiveness

53
00:02:14,909 --> 00:02:17,343
is perceived differently
in men and women.

54
00:02:17,345 --> 00:02:20,245
Men who are assertive
tend to be admired.

55
00:02:20,247 --> 00:02:23,215
They're called...
anyone?

56
00:02:23,217 --> 00:02:25,017
That's a terrible idea.

57
00:02:25,019 --> 00:02:26,685
What is?

58
00:02:26,687 --> 00:02:28,320
Them in there all together.

59
00:02:28,322 --> 00:02:29,788
They stay in there too long,

60
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:32,558
they're gonna get
on the same cycle.

61
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,326
Wreak havoc on our plumbing.

62
00:02:36,496 --> 00:02:37,796
Everyone, guys...

63
00:02:37,798 --> 00:02:38,964
Circle up, please.

64
00:02:38,966 --> 00:02:41,033
Come on over.
Bring your chairs.

65
00:02:41,035 --> 00:02:43,569
Toby, come on over.

66
00:02:43,571 --> 00:02:46,505
You're a guy... too.
Sort of.

67
00:02:46,507 --> 00:02:48,640
Let's do this.

68
00:02:48,642 --> 00:02:50,109
Well, first of all,

69
00:02:50,111 --> 00:02:52,144
I, uh, just wanna
warm up a little bit.

70
00:02:52,146 --> 00:02:53,178
Let's just clap.

71
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:54,847
Let's just clap.
Ready?

72
00:02:54,849 --> 00:02:56,849
Yeah!

73
00:02:56,851 --> 00:02:59,084
Yeah! That's what
I'm talkin' about!

74
00:02:59,086 --> 00:03:00,686
I don't know what you're
doing here, Michael.

75
00:03:00,688 --> 00:03:03,389
Just having a little
guys in the workplace thing.

76
00:03:03,391 --> 00:03:06,692
Why can't boys play with dolls?

77
00:03:06,694 --> 00:03:09,862
Why does society

78
00:03:09,864 --> 00:03:12,297
force us to use urinals

79
00:03:12,299 --> 00:03:14,133
when sitting down
is far more comfortable?

80
00:03:14,135 --> 00:03:15,901
Can you please do this
somewhere else, Michael?

81
00:03:15,903 --> 00:03:17,603
We have nowhere else, Jan.

82
00:03:17,605 --> 00:03:18,904
This...

83
00:03:18,906 --> 00:03:20,372
We could do it in the warehouse.

84
00:03:20,374 --> 00:03:22,174
Dwight, excellent idea.
Go to the warehouse.

85
00:03:22,176 --> 00:03:23,942
Okay, fine.
Be actually perfect.

86
00:03:23,944 --> 00:03:25,244
Perfect!
You know what?

87
00:03:25,246 --> 00:03:28,514
There is another side
to this place, gentlemen.

88
00:03:28,516 --> 00:03:30,416
And I know we all love

89
00:03:30,418 --> 00:03:33,052
our cushy jobs and our fun,
exciting office.

90
00:03:33,054 --> 00:03:35,054
But do you realize
that underneath us

91
00:03:35,056 --> 00:03:36,555
there is another world.

92
00:03:36,557 --> 00:03:38,223
The warehouse world.

93
00:03:38,225 --> 00:03:41,493
A world that is teeming
with sweat and dirt

94
00:03:41,495 --> 00:03:43,195
and life.

95
00:03:43,197 --> 00:03:45,164
Life.

96
00:03:45,166 --> 00:03:46,865
The bowels of the office.

97
00:03:46,867 --> 00:03:48,267
These guys are down there.

98
00:03:48,269 --> 00:03:51,036
They are real men
doing real man's work.

99
00:03:51,038 --> 00:03:54,873
We are going to learn
how a warehouse works.

100
00:03:56,876 --> 00:03:58,744
Oh, I think this is gonna
work out great.

101
00:03:58,746 --> 00:04:01,346
Because managing the warehouse

102
00:04:01,348 --> 00:04:03,315
is a very important
part of my job.

103
00:04:03,317 --> 00:04:05,717
And I haven't been there
in months.

104
00:04:28,641 --> 00:04:32,678
Remember on Lost,
when they met the Others?

105
00:04:34,447 --> 00:04:36,582
I'm so sorry about that.

106
00:04:36,584 --> 00:04:38,817
Um, so where were we?

107
00:04:38,819 --> 00:04:40,619
Pam, are you okay
taking notes then?

108
00:04:40,621 --> 00:04:41,753
Mm-hmm.
Please?

109
00:04:41,755 --> 00:04:43,856
Yeah.
Thank you very much.

110
00:04:43,858 --> 00:04:45,624
So let's meet the warehouse!

111
00:04:45,626 --> 00:04:48,227
Let's get some shots.

112
00:04:48,229 --> 00:04:49,962
Pan around there.

113
00:04:49,964 --> 00:04:53,232
This is Darrell,
one of our warehouse staff.

114
00:04:53,234 --> 00:04:56,135
Darrell, what is
your biggest fear?

115
00:04:56,137 --> 00:04:58,103
My biggest fear is that
someone will distract us

116
00:04:58,105 --> 00:04:59,771
from getting all
the shipments out on time.

117
00:04:59,773 --> 00:05:00,839
You know what?

118
00:05:00,841 --> 00:05:02,207
Darrell is actually
the foreman here,

119
00:05:02,209 --> 00:05:04,476
and not Roy, which is cool.

120
00:05:04,478 --> 00:05:06,211
There's Roy, ridin' the big rig!

121
00:05:06,213 --> 00:05:08,514
Um, so Roy is actually
going to be marrying Pam

122
00:05:08,516 --> 00:05:10,382
sometime this summer.

123
00:05:10,384 --> 00:05:12,718
And, uh, she's our receptionist.

124
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,386
Sort of a BrAngelina thing.

125
00:05:14,388 --> 00:05:15,787
Why?

126
00:05:15,789 --> 00:05:18,957
BrAnangelina is
the Brad Pitt and Angelina.

127
00:05:18,959 --> 00:05:20,926
I don't understand.
Roy... Roy and Pam.

128
00:05:20,928 --> 00:05:22,294
It's a Ram.

129
00:05:22,296 --> 00:05:23,462
It's a Ram thing.

130
00:05:23,464 --> 00:05:26,765
I bet Roy heard about
you liking Pam.

131
00:05:26,767 --> 00:05:27,933
I bet he'll try

132
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:30,135
to beat you up.

133
00:05:30,137 --> 00:05:31,770
Thanks for
the heads-up, Kev.

134
00:05:31,772 --> 00:05:34,206
I got your back if he does.

135
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:38,944
But try to stay out of it.

136
00:05:40,214 --> 00:05:41,647
Just in case there's
somebody down here

137
00:05:41,649 --> 00:05:42,848
who shouldn't be.

138
00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:44,383
A little Good Will Hunting
situation.

139
00:05:44,385 --> 00:05:46,218
All right, troops.

140
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:49,555
This is... an important day.
A big day.

141
00:05:49,557 --> 00:05:51,590
Now, you may

142
00:05:51,592 --> 00:05:55,961
look around and see
two groups here.

143
00:05:55,963 --> 00:05:57,696
White-collar, blue-collar.

144
00:05:57,698 --> 00:05:59,097
But I don't see it that way.

145
00:05:59,099 --> 00:06:00,165
And you know why not?

146
00:06:00,167 --> 00:06:03,635
Because I am collar-blind.

147
00:06:05,238 --> 00:06:06,672
Why don't we go around the table

148
00:06:06,674 --> 00:06:08,840
and all say something
that we know we're good at.

149
00:06:08,842 --> 00:06:12,277
I will start.
I am good at public speaking.

150
00:06:12,279 --> 00:06:14,580
Hi, I'm Meredith,
and I'm an al...

151
00:06:14,582 --> 00:06:16,582
Good at supplier relations.

152
00:06:16,584 --> 00:06:18,050
Great.
Phyllis.

153
00:06:18,052 --> 00:06:20,118
Um, I'm good at computer stuff.

154
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:22,988
E-mails, um, spreadsheets,
all that.

155
00:06:22,990 --> 00:06:23,989
Really?

156
00:06:23,991 --> 00:06:25,924
I don't know.
I thought that...

157
00:06:25,926 --> 00:06:27,226
No, okay, stop.

158
00:06:27,228 --> 00:06:28,760
You know, I've seen
some of your spreadsheets.

159
00:06:28,762 --> 00:06:29,861
And I almost always...
Really?

160
00:06:29,863 --> 00:06:31,163
I thought they were pretty...

161
00:06:31,165 --> 00:06:33,065
I don't know how I fit in
with these women.

162
00:06:33,067 --> 00:06:35,067
Here.

163
00:06:35,069 --> 00:06:36,768
Or with Jan.

164
00:06:36,770 --> 00:06:38,737
Um, I mean, we get along great.

165
00:06:38,739 --> 00:06:40,072
Fine.

166
00:06:40,074 --> 00:06:43,342
Um... I guess the person
I have the most in common with

167
00:06:43,344 --> 00:06:45,143
is...

168
00:06:45,145 --> 00:06:46,845
Jim.

169
00:06:46,847 --> 00:06:48,180
Halpert.

170
00:06:48,182 --> 00:06:49,448
Hey, uh,

171
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:50,549
I, uh, you know.

172
00:06:50,551 --> 00:06:52,417
Heard there's a rumor
going around about,

173
00:06:52,419 --> 00:06:54,319
you know, you used
to have a crush on Pam.

174
00:06:54,321 --> 00:06:55,354
Oh, no, no, no.

175
00:06:55,356 --> 00:06:56,588
No, no.
No, it's cool.

176
00:06:56,590 --> 00:06:57,689
'Cause I know you're a good guy,

177
00:06:57,691 --> 00:06:58,724
and I know that that crush

178
00:06:58,726 --> 00:07:01,126
ended a long time ago,
so, you know.

179
00:07:01,128 --> 00:07:02,661
We're cool, right?

180
00:07:02,663 --> 00:07:05,464
Yeah.
No, yeah, definitely.

181
00:07:05,466 --> 00:07:06,598
You know, it's great with me,

182
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,866
'cause that way...

183
00:07:07,868 --> 00:07:09,301
I'm glad she has
a friend at work

184
00:07:09,303 --> 00:07:10,502
she can get through
the day with.

185
00:07:10,504 --> 00:07:12,004
That way she's not all,
"Bah, bah, bah, bah,"

186
00:07:12,006 --> 00:07:13,071
you know, when she gets home.

187
00:07:13,073 --> 00:07:14,806
Yeah, I like talking to her too.

188
00:07:14,808 --> 00:07:16,742
So, uh...
we're cool, right?

189
00:07:16,744 --> 00:07:18,577
Yes. Yeah.

190
00:07:18,579 --> 00:07:19,611
Good.
All right.

191
00:07:19,613 --> 00:07:21,380
Cool, man.
Sweet.

192
00:07:28,755 --> 00:07:29,955
Hey, Mike, look.

193
00:07:29,957 --> 00:07:32,291
How about we go
upstairs, too, you know?

194
00:07:32,293 --> 00:07:33,659
Learn how an office works.

195
00:07:33,661 --> 00:07:35,294
Oh, well... We can both
switch places for the day.

196
00:07:35,296 --> 00:07:36,895
Okay, yeah, you know what?

197
00:07:36,897 --> 00:07:38,664
I don't... you're...

198
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:40,198
My job sucks compared to this.

199
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:42,067
I don't think you'd like it up there.
Good experience.

200
00:07:42,069 --> 00:07:43,902
Guys! You wanna start
unloading the truck?

201
00:07:45,838 --> 00:07:48,774
Okay, let's go.
Step up.

202
00:07:48,776 --> 00:07:50,776
Check this out.

203
00:07:50,778 --> 00:07:52,678
Look at that.
Look at that.

204
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:53,812
Ba boop!

205
00:07:53,814 --> 00:07:55,047
"Hello, how are..."

206
00:07:55,049 --> 00:07:56,415
Okay.

207
00:07:58,785 --> 00:08:00,585
That's great.

208
00:08:00,587 --> 00:08:02,387
That is good stuff.

209
00:08:02,389 --> 00:08:06,024
In five years, I'd like
to be five years sober.

210
00:08:06,026 --> 00:08:08,126
That is an excellent goal.

211
00:08:08,128 --> 00:08:09,795
41/2.

212
00:08:09,797 --> 00:08:11,396
I'll tell you one thing.

213
00:08:11,398 --> 00:08:13,332
I am not gonna be
one of those women

214
00:08:13,334 --> 00:08:15,567
schlepping her kids
around in a minivan.

215
00:08:15,569 --> 00:08:17,369
Great. Uh-huh.

216
00:08:17,371 --> 00:08:20,205
I want an SUV
with three rows of seats.

217
00:08:20,207 --> 00:08:21,707
That would be great.

218
00:08:21,709 --> 00:08:22,974
Well, I'll be honest.
One of the goals

219
00:08:22,976 --> 00:08:24,176
of these women's seminars

220
00:08:24,178 --> 00:08:25,744
is to feel out if there's
any standouts.

221
00:08:25,746 --> 00:08:28,580
Women who could be a valuable
addition to our corporate life.

222
00:08:32,352 --> 00:08:34,353
Michael wants us to bond.

223
00:08:34,355 --> 00:08:35,954
So we need topics
for conversation.

224
00:08:35,956 --> 00:08:37,556
Ponies.

225
00:08:37,558 --> 00:08:38,623
No.

226
00:08:38,625 --> 00:08:39,758
How about rainbows?

227
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,126
No.

228
00:08:41,128 --> 00:08:42,227
Flowers.

229
00:08:42,229 --> 00:08:43,395
That's dangerous, Michael.

230
00:08:43,397 --> 00:08:44,563
Come on, get down from there.

231
00:08:44,565 --> 00:08:45,564
You're gonna hurt yourself.

232
00:08:45,566 --> 00:08:46,631
Mike...
Stand clear.

233
00:08:46,633 --> 00:08:47,833
Mike, get off
of the lift, please!

234
00:08:47,835 --> 00:08:48,967
I'm fine, I'm fine.
Come on, now.

235
00:08:48,969 --> 00:08:50,435
I'm fine.

236
00:08:50,437 --> 00:08:53,271
Would you... look.

237
00:08:53,273 --> 00:08:54,873
Oh, oh, oh!

238
00:08:59,011 --> 00:09:00,612
We'll get somebody
to clean that up.

239
00:09:00,614 --> 00:09:03,215
We're the ones that
gotta clean that up!

240
00:09:03,217 --> 00:09:04,783
Damn it, Michael!

241
00:09:04,785 --> 00:09:08,320
We have to have
this thing serviced.

242
00:09:08,322 --> 00:09:11,022
So, guys' gripe session.

243
00:09:11,024 --> 00:09:12,090
Here we are.

244
00:09:12,092 --> 00:09:13,525
Now, we definitely live

245
00:09:13,527 --> 00:09:15,761
in different worlds,

246
00:09:15,763 --> 00:09:17,963
but we have a lot in common.

247
00:09:17,965 --> 00:09:20,465
We even like the same girls,

248
00:09:20,467 --> 00:09:21,733
some of us.

249
00:09:21,735 --> 00:09:22,901
And that's gonna happen.

250
00:09:22,903 --> 00:09:24,069
You know, we're guys.

251
00:09:24,071 --> 00:09:25,604
So...

252
00:09:25,606 --> 00:09:27,506
Hey... do you
want me to go?

253
00:09:27,508 --> 00:09:29,708
No... why would I...

254
00:09:29,710 --> 00:09:30,842
You could...

255
00:09:30,844 --> 00:09:31,843
I'll go.

256
00:09:31,845 --> 00:09:33,145
Stay or...

257
00:09:34,847 --> 00:09:36,448
And a big,
walk-in closet.

258
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:37,849
Oh, that's part of my dream too.

259
00:09:37,851 --> 00:09:39,418
Oh, me too.

260
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:41,553
Great. Okay.

261
00:09:41,555 --> 00:09:43,021
And, Pam, what about you?

262
00:09:43,023 --> 00:09:44,356
What is your dream?

263
00:09:44,358 --> 00:09:47,793
Well... I always
dreamed of a house

264
00:09:47,795 --> 00:09:49,294
with a terrace upstairs.

265
00:09:49,296 --> 00:09:51,196
Plant flowers on it,
stuff like that.

266
00:09:51,198 --> 00:09:54,065
Since I was a girl.

267
00:09:54,067 --> 00:09:55,100
Um...

268
00:09:55,102 --> 00:09:56,935
More seriously, though,

269
00:09:56,937 --> 00:09:59,004
a husband that I love.

270
00:09:59,006 --> 00:10:00,005
Roy.

271
00:10:00,007 --> 00:10:01,973
And...

272
00:10:01,975 --> 00:10:03,975
I love to draw.

273
00:10:03,977 --> 00:10:05,444
And I did a little in college.

274
00:10:05,446 --> 00:10:06,912
And I'd still
love to do something

275
00:10:06,914 --> 00:10:09,614
where I could work with art
or graphic design in some way.

276
00:10:09,616 --> 00:10:10,816
She's real good.

277
00:10:10,818 --> 00:10:12,784
You know, the company
is offering

278
00:10:12,786 --> 00:10:15,220
a design training program
in New York.

279
00:10:15,222 --> 00:10:16,822
Well, I have a job right now.

280
00:10:16,824 --> 00:10:18,323
So I can't really take time off.

281
00:10:18,325 --> 00:10:19,724
Well, it's...
it's only on weekends.

282
00:10:19,726 --> 00:10:21,226
And then a few weeks
in New York.

283
00:10:21,228 --> 00:10:24,062
But I'm sure that I could
ask corporate to help you out.

284
00:10:24,064 --> 00:10:25,197
Well, it's just that

285
00:10:25,199 --> 00:10:26,631
the weekends aren't good
because, um...

286
00:10:26,633 --> 00:10:29,267
There are always a million
reasons not to do something.

287
00:10:34,106 --> 00:10:35,574
Let's start with the warehouse.

288
00:10:35,576 --> 00:10:38,143
What bothers you as guys?
You know?

289
00:10:38,145 --> 00:10:39,811
My priority is safety.

290
00:10:39,813 --> 00:10:40,846
Okay.

291
00:10:40,848 --> 00:10:42,214
So it really bothers me
when somebody

292
00:10:42,216 --> 00:10:43,815
comes in here speeding around
on a lift,

293
00:10:43,817 --> 00:10:44,950
playing with it like a toy.

294
00:10:44,952 --> 00:10:46,284
It kind of gets
under my skin, okay?

295
00:10:46,286 --> 00:10:48,119
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Shh, shh.

296
00:10:48,121 --> 00:10:49,321
Uh-uh, don't...
don't shush me.

297
00:10:49,323 --> 00:10:50,722
I... that was just...

298
00:10:50,724 --> 00:10:51,957
That bothers me too.
I was breathing.

299
00:10:51,959 --> 00:10:53,792
Pam shushes me.
It drives me crazy.

300
00:10:53,794 --> 00:10:55,494
I hate shushing, you know?
That's the thing.

301
00:10:55,496 --> 00:10:57,295
What b... okay.
What is our...

302
00:10:57,297 --> 00:11:00,198
beef as... human men.

303
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:02,067
You know, that's a good
question, Hasselhoff.

304
00:11:04,571 --> 00:11:06,404
Okay.
What bugs us?

305
00:11:06,406 --> 00:11:07,439
All right, good.

306
00:11:07,441 --> 00:11:09,040
Guys raggin' on each other.

307
00:11:09,042 --> 00:11:12,244
That's what guys do.
And we love it.

308
00:11:12,246 --> 00:11:14,880
All right, let's talk about...

309
00:11:14,882 --> 00:11:16,314
clothing.

310
00:11:16,316 --> 00:11:18,183
I'm excited about today.

311
00:11:18,185 --> 00:11:20,418
I love girl talk.

312
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:22,287
Dress for the job you want,

313
00:11:22,289 --> 00:11:23,855
not the job you have.

314
00:11:23,857 --> 00:11:25,190
All right, you can
use your clothing

315
00:11:25,192 --> 00:11:26,825
to send a message
about your ambitions

316
00:11:26,827 --> 00:11:30,495
by wearing clothes that reflect
what you aspire to be.

317
00:11:30,497 --> 00:11:32,464
I'm not gaining anything
from this seminar.

318
00:11:32,466 --> 00:11:34,299
I'm a professional woman.

319
00:11:34,301 --> 00:11:35,800
The head of accounting.

320
00:11:35,802 --> 00:11:38,270
I'm in the healthiest
relationship of my life.

321
00:11:38,272 --> 00:11:41,640
I just think it's insulting
that Jan thinks we need this.

322
00:11:41,642 --> 00:11:45,610
And apparently...
judging from her outfit...

323
00:11:45,612 --> 00:11:47,646
Jan aspires to be a whore.

324
00:11:49,115 --> 00:11:50,615
I hate it when girls insist

325
00:11:50,617 --> 00:11:52,450
on taking them out
to restaurants

326
00:11:52,452 --> 00:11:54,119
every weekend night,
and then they're like,

327
00:11:54,121 --> 00:11:56,054
"When are we gonna
go on a date date?"

328
00:11:56,056 --> 00:11:57,322
Oh, I hate that, too, man.

329
00:11:57,324 --> 00:11:58,423
Exactly!

330
00:11:58,425 --> 00:12:00,759
That sucks so hard.

331
00:12:00,761 --> 00:12:02,928
And then they make you drive 'em
to church the next morning.

332
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:05,697
Like, gas ain't free!

333
00:12:05,699 --> 00:12:07,766
Yeah, on our salaries, man,

334
00:12:07,768 --> 00:12:08,867
what do they expect, you know?

335
00:12:08,869 --> 00:12:10,302
What, "take us
out every weekend"?

336
00:12:10,304 --> 00:12:11,503
You know what I mean?

337
00:12:11,505 --> 00:12:13,171
We're not millionaires.
I feel you.

338
00:12:13,173 --> 00:12:14,573
No, you don't.
You don't feel us.

339
00:12:14,575 --> 00:12:16,408
How can you?
You... you know what?

340
00:12:16,410 --> 00:12:17,809
Not literally.

341
00:12:17,811 --> 00:12:19,010
You say we're the same,

342
00:12:19,012 --> 00:12:20,412
but we get compensated
very differently.

343
00:12:20,414 --> 00:12:22,013
Yes. We work the
same hours as you,

344
00:12:22,015 --> 00:12:23,782
and you just said
we work a lot harder.

345
00:12:23,784 --> 00:12:25,417
Uh, you do, so...

346
00:12:25,419 --> 00:12:26,818
But we get paid a lot less.

347
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:28,420
Nn... yy...
Word.

348
00:12:28,422 --> 00:12:29,721
Like, next to no benefits.

349
00:12:29,723 --> 00:12:31,022
I know.
God, what is that?

350
00:12:31,024 --> 00:12:32,157
Exactly!

351
00:12:32,159 --> 00:12:33,925
It blows, it blows, man!

352
00:12:33,927 --> 00:12:35,060
You know, this would not happen

353
00:12:35,062 --> 00:12:36,194
if we had a union.

354
00:12:36,196 --> 00:12:37,629
That's what I'm talking about.

355
00:12:37,631 --> 00:12:40,098
Yeah... no. Absolutely,
that's what we need.

356
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:42,100
Man, see, that's what
I been sayin', man.

357
00:12:42,102 --> 00:12:43,835
We need to do this finally.

358
00:12:43,837 --> 00:12:45,236
You know what?
Is that necessary?

359
00:12:45,238 --> 00:12:48,106
'Cause you already sort of
have a union of guys.

360
00:12:48,108 --> 00:12:49,608
It's more than necessary, Mike.

361
00:12:49,610 --> 00:12:52,611
We need this.
Roy... you still have that card

362
00:12:52,613 --> 00:12:53,878
from the dock worker's union?

363
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:55,513
Dock workers?
Man, hook him up.

364
00:12:55,515 --> 00:12:56,581
Come on, man!

365
00:12:56,583 --> 00:12:57,882
Yeah.

366
00:12:57,884 --> 00:12:59,217
You know what, I think, uh...

367
00:12:59,219 --> 00:13:00,418
Problem is the chicks.

368
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:02,520
Union, yeah! The
problem is the chicks.

369
00:13:02,522 --> 00:13:04,522
And you gotta blame them.

370
00:13:06,225 --> 00:13:07,659
Are you with us, Mike?

371
00:13:07,661 --> 00:13:09,494
Yeah, s...

372
00:13:09,496 --> 00:13:11,396
Welcome to the warehouse.

373
00:13:11,398 --> 00:13:12,464
Mi-chael!

374
00:13:12,466 --> 00:13:15,433
Mi-chael! Mi-chael! Mi-chael!

375
00:13:16,602 --> 00:13:19,337
Another issue
is inequality of pay

376
00:13:19,339 --> 00:13:20,705
between men and women.

377
00:13:20,707 --> 00:13:22,507
I'm sure that all of you
have dealt with that before.

378
00:13:23,543 --> 00:13:24,576
This is important.

379
00:13:24,578 --> 00:13:25,610
Ladies, take a breather.

380
00:13:26,747 --> 00:13:28,480
Jan, I, uh...

381
00:13:28,482 --> 00:13:30,882
wanted...

382
00:13:30,884 --> 00:13:32,150
Can I help you?

383
00:13:33,919 --> 00:13:36,488
Um, I wanted to say
that the guys downstairs

384
00:13:36,490 --> 00:13:38,223
are thinking about
forming a union.

385
00:13:38,225 --> 00:13:40,125
And they have some good points.
What? A union?

386
00:13:40,127 --> 00:13:41,292
Don't get hysterical.
I'm not.

387
00:13:41,294 --> 00:13:44,529
Part of my job
is knowing how to talk to women.

388
00:13:44,531 --> 00:13:47,565
Let's... be...
rational... here.

389
00:13:47,567 --> 00:13:49,734
What are the pros,
what are the cons?

390
00:13:49,736 --> 00:13:52,103
The cons are that everyone
will lose their job, Michael.

391
00:13:52,105 --> 00:13:54,339
Everyone.
Office, warehouse.

392
00:13:55,474 --> 00:13:58,610
What do you think
the... pros... are... here?

393
00:13:58,612 --> 00:14:01,279
Don't talk to me
that way, please.

394
00:14:01,281 --> 00:14:04,249
Just... they're gonna
wanna hear this from you.

395
00:14:04,251 --> 00:14:05,884
Oh, you got yourself
into this, Michael,

396
00:14:05,886 --> 00:14:08,253
so you get yourself out. Well,
we're bonding down there.

397
00:14:08,255 --> 00:14:09,621
I just don't wanna
have to tell them something

398
00:14:09,623 --> 00:14:10,655
they're not gonna wanna hear!

399
00:14:10,657 --> 00:14:11,790
Now who's getting hysterical?

400
00:14:11,792 --> 00:14:12,957
Okay... Come on Jan.

401
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:14,292
After all we've been through.

402
00:14:14,294 --> 00:14:15,627
Michael, Michael...
We have history.

403
00:14:15,629 --> 00:14:17,228
We have a history.
Michael.

404
00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:18,430
Between us.

405
00:14:18,432 --> 00:14:20,131
Don't say another word.

406
00:14:20,133 --> 00:14:23,001
Get... yourself...
down... stairs.

407
00:14:23,003 --> 00:14:24,335
I'm just saying
that we have something...

408
00:14:24,337 --> 00:14:26,104
Okay, whatever.

409
00:14:28,474 --> 00:14:30,608
You know what?

410
00:14:30,610 --> 00:14:32,010
We could get this done
a lot quicker

411
00:14:32,012 --> 00:14:33,812
if we formed
a type of assembly line.

412
00:14:33,814 --> 00:14:37,215
This here is
a run-out-the-clock situation.

413
00:14:37,217 --> 00:14:39,984
Just like upstairs.

414
00:14:39,986 --> 00:14:41,820
Sports metaphors

415
00:14:41,822 --> 00:14:43,121
are one of the ways
women feel left out

416
00:14:43,123 --> 00:14:44,289
of the language of the office.

417
00:14:44,291 --> 00:14:45,857
Now, I know this
might sound silly,

418
00:14:45,859 --> 00:14:47,459
but many women
ask to go over it.

419
00:14:47,461 --> 00:14:49,561
So... fumble means...

420
00:14:49,563 --> 00:14:51,296
Mistake. Slip. Right.

421
00:14:51,298 --> 00:14:53,798
Par for the course
is a golf term.

422
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:55,533
It means right on track.

423
00:14:55,535 --> 00:14:58,369
Uh, below par means worse.

424
00:14:58,371 --> 00:15:00,705
Wait, that should mean better.
That doesn't make sense.

425
00:15:00,707 --> 00:15:02,040
What about second base?

426
00:15:02,042 --> 00:15:05,810
Like if Michael said
he got to second base with you?

427
00:15:05,812 --> 00:15:07,679
Does that mean you
had closed a deal?

428
00:15:07,681 --> 00:15:08,913
Excuse me?

429
00:15:08,915 --> 00:15:11,082
I mean, that's
a baseball term, right?

430
00:15:11,084 --> 00:15:13,151
I don't know what...
Michael was...

431
00:15:13,153 --> 00:15:14,753
talking about, I don't know.

432
00:15:14,755 --> 00:15:16,154
Like, you went to Chili's,

433
00:15:16,156 --> 00:15:17,689
and he got
to second base with you.

434
00:15:17,691 --> 00:15:19,023
Excuse me.

435
00:15:19,025 --> 00:15:20,592
Kelly, I don't know
what Michael was talking about.

436
00:15:20,594 --> 00:15:23,194
He just told everybody,
and I just wanna know...

437
00:15:23,196 --> 00:15:24,262
Hey.

438
00:15:24,264 --> 00:15:25,530
Hey!

439
00:15:25,532 --> 00:15:26,898
How's it going down there?

440
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:28,433
It's a complete d...
Well, actually,

441
00:15:28,435 --> 00:15:29,634
it's exactly
what you'd expect, so...

442
00:15:29,636 --> 00:15:30,769
Right.

443
00:15:30,771 --> 00:15:31,936
How are the girls?
Good.

444
00:15:31,938 --> 00:15:34,506
We watched a video about
our changing bodies.

445
00:15:34,508 --> 00:15:35,740
Did you really?

446
00:15:35,742 --> 00:15:37,208
No.
Oh.

447
00:15:37,210 --> 00:15:39,144
Almost.

448
00:15:39,146 --> 00:15:42,113
Um, but, hey, um...
something kind of cool.

449
00:15:42,115 --> 00:15:44,582
There's this internship
in graphic design

450
00:15:44,584 --> 00:15:46,317
that Jan was telling us about.

451
00:15:46,319 --> 00:15:48,820
She made it sound, like,
really great.

452
00:15:48,822 --> 00:15:50,789
Nice.
Well, what's it all about?

453
00:15:50,791 --> 00:15:52,690
I think you should do it.

454
00:15:52,692 --> 00:15:53,992
That's great.

455
00:15:53,994 --> 00:15:56,294
It's really cool.

456
00:15:56,296 --> 00:15:59,664
Cold front comin' in
to the warehouse!

457
00:15:59,666 --> 00:16:01,166
Uh-oh!

458
00:16:01,168 --> 00:16:03,468
Better put on your ski boots!

459
00:16:04,971 --> 00:16:07,772
Wooooow!

460
00:16:07,774 --> 00:16:10,942
Happy New Year, Darrell!

461
00:16:10,944 --> 00:16:12,911
Hey, Darrell!

462
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:16,014
You ever done this?

463
00:16:18,117 --> 00:16:19,417
Are you married?

464
00:16:19,419 --> 00:16:21,286
I'm divorced.

465
00:16:21,288 --> 00:16:23,188
That must have been hard.
It was.

466
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:24,489
Yes.

467
00:16:24,491 --> 00:16:26,424
You were probably feeling
really depressed and sad,

468
00:16:26,426 --> 00:16:29,093
and that's why you
did that thing with Michael.

469
00:16:29,095 --> 00:16:30,829
I think you should all spend
a little more time

470
00:16:30,831 --> 00:16:33,331
thinking about your careers
and less time on personal stuff.

471
00:16:33,333 --> 00:16:35,867
Mmm, I think we're all okay
with the balance we've struck.

472
00:16:35,869 --> 00:16:37,535
At least you don't have kids.

473
00:16:37,537 --> 00:16:39,938
You have no kids, right?
Thank God.

474
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:42,841
Okay, let's take five.
I think we could all use five.

475
00:16:44,510 --> 00:16:47,745
How can someone
so beautiful be so sad?

476
00:16:50,616 --> 00:16:51,850
Hi.

477
00:16:51,852 --> 00:16:53,384
Did you take care
of the situation?

478
00:16:53,386 --> 00:16:54,419
Yeah, yeah.

479
00:16:54,421 --> 00:16:57,222
Yes, I...
I have... essentially...

480
00:16:57,224 --> 00:16:59,057
Excuse me. Excuse me.
Yes, I've take...

481
00:16:59,059 --> 00:17:01,292
I'm told that there's
been some interest

482
00:17:01,294 --> 00:17:03,528
in forming a union,
and that Michael supported it.

483
00:17:03,530 --> 00:17:05,597
Obviously he's not
a friend of yours,

484
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:06,898
because he didn't
tell you the facts.

485
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:08,199
So let me.

486
00:17:08,201 --> 00:17:11,236
If there is even a whiff
of unionizing in this branch,

487
00:17:11,238 --> 00:17:13,771
I can guarantee you the branch
will be shut down like that.

488
00:17:13,773 --> 00:17:15,039
They unionized in Pittsfield,

489
00:17:15,041 --> 00:17:16,908
and we all know
what happened in Pittsfield.

490
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:19,344
It will cost each of you
a fortune in legal fees

491
00:17:19,346 --> 00:17:21,112
and union dues,
and that'll be nothing

492
00:17:21,114 --> 00:17:22,647
compared to the cost
of losing your jobs.

493
00:17:22,649 --> 00:17:25,550
So I would think
long and hard before

494
00:17:25,552 --> 00:17:27,318
sacrificing your savings
and your futures

495
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:29,621
just to send a message.

496
00:17:29,623 --> 00:17:30,989
If you have
any further questions,

497
00:17:30,991 --> 00:17:32,557
you can direct them to...

498
00:17:34,326 --> 00:17:35,526
To Michael.

499
00:17:39,065 --> 00:17:41,866
Dreams are just that.
They're dreams.

500
00:17:41,868 --> 00:17:43,902
They help get you
through the day.

501
00:17:43,904 --> 00:17:45,236
Like the thing
about the terrace.

502
00:17:45,238 --> 00:17:47,038
It's nice.

503
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:48,673
But, um...
I don't know.

504
00:17:48,675 --> 00:17:51,175
It was just something I read
in this book when I was 12.

505
00:17:51,177 --> 00:17:53,411
Uh, the girl in the book
has a terrace

506
00:17:53,413 --> 00:17:54,846
outside of her bedroom.

507
00:17:54,848 --> 00:17:57,582
And she planted flowers on it.

508
00:17:57,584 --> 00:17:59,584
And I just loved that.

509
00:17:59,586 --> 00:18:01,653
Just always kind of
stuck with me.

510
00:18:01,655 --> 00:18:04,188
So you're not doing it?

511
00:18:05,624 --> 00:18:07,358
How did you know?

512
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:09,494
Why not?

513
00:18:09,496 --> 00:18:12,030
Just not...
no big reason.

514
00:18:12,032 --> 00:18:13,131
Just a bunch of little reasons.

515
00:18:13,133 --> 00:18:14,966
Come on.

516
00:18:14,968 --> 00:18:16,501
Roy's right.

517
00:18:16,503 --> 00:18:18,369
There's no guarantee it's
gonna lead to anything anyway.

518
00:18:18,371 --> 00:18:20,204
Roy said that?

519
00:18:20,206 --> 00:18:24,275
What? You have
something you wanna say?

520
00:18:24,277 --> 00:18:28,880
You gotta take a chance
on something sometime, Pam.

521
00:18:28,882 --> 00:18:31,916
I mean, do you wanna
be a receptionist here, always?

522
00:18:31,918 --> 00:18:33,217
Oh, excuse me!

523
00:18:33,219 --> 00:18:34,986
I'm fine with my choices.

524
00:18:35,888 --> 00:18:37,255
You are?

525
00:18:37,923 --> 00:18:38,990
Yeah.

526
00:18:40,459 --> 00:18:41,726
It's impractical.

527
00:18:41,728 --> 00:18:45,096
I'm not gonna...
try to get a house like that.

528
00:18:45,098 --> 00:18:48,299
Um, they don't even make houses
like that in Scranton.

529
00:18:48,301 --> 00:18:49,901
So I'm never gonna...

530
00:18:56,909 --> 00:18:58,710
Just gonna push this over there!

531
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:02,981
This is not a good idea
right here.

532
00:19:05,417 --> 00:19:07,418
Easy does it. Okay.

533
00:19:13,625 --> 00:19:14,993
Pizza.

534
00:19:14,995 --> 00:19:16,928
Great equalizer.

535
00:19:16,930 --> 00:19:19,731
Rich people love pizza.
Poor people love pizza.

536
00:19:19,733 --> 00:19:22,200
White people love pizza.
Black people love pizza.

537
00:19:23,569 --> 00:19:26,237
Do black people like pizza?

538
00:19:36,148 --> 00:19:39,250
Hey... um...

539
00:19:39,252 --> 00:19:40,585
Look, guys, I'm sorry.

540
00:19:40,587 --> 00:19:43,187
Sometimes, Jan...

541
00:19:43,189 --> 00:19:44,822
can be such a bitch.

542
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:48,960
Hey, watch it.
Watch it.

543
00:19:48,962 --> 00:19:50,628
We have a relationship.

544
00:19:50,630 --> 00:19:52,630
Thank you to our hosts.

545
00:19:52,632 --> 00:19:54,132
Hey, Michael!

546
00:19:54,134 --> 00:19:55,833
This ain't over.

547
00:20:03,642 --> 00:20:05,810
Excellent.

548
00:20:05,812 --> 00:20:07,178
Is it good to be back?
Yeah.

549
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:08,946
I mean,
I love the guy stuff, but...

550
00:20:08,948 --> 00:20:11,382
to run an office,
you need men and women.

551
00:20:11,384 --> 00:20:12,650
You know why?

552
00:20:12,652 --> 00:20:16,320
Because you need to have
that crazy sexual tension

553
00:20:16,322 --> 00:20:18,356
to keep things interesting.

554
00:20:28,968 --> 00:20:31,502
Dunder-Mifflin.
This is Pam.

555
00:20:33,038 --> 00:20:34,739
Uh, hold, please.

556
00:20:39,778 --> 00:20:42,513
Snow angel!
Snow angel!
