1
00:00:12,926 --> 00:00:14,393
You should get one of these.

2
00:00:14,395 --> 00:00:16,094
No. Thank you.

3
00:00:16,096 --> 00:00:18,597
Do you even know what this is?

4
00:00:18,599 --> 00:00:20,265
It is a fitness orb.

5
00:00:20,267 --> 00:00:22,201
And it has completely
changed my life.

6
00:00:23,903 --> 00:00:25,904
Forget everything
you thought you knew

7
00:00:25,906 --> 00:00:28,040
about ab workouts.
Done.

8
00:00:28,042 --> 00:00:29,308
This ab workout

9
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:33,145
is specifically designed
to strengthen your core.

10
00:00:33,147 --> 00:00:34,413
Sorry.

11
00:00:34,415 --> 00:00:35,480
That's all right.

12
00:00:36,015 --> 00:00:37,382
Numerous health benefits.

13
00:00:41,188 --> 00:00:42,521
Strengthens your back.

14
00:00:42,523 --> 00:00:44,856
Better performance in sports.

15
00:00:44,858 --> 00:00:46,625
More enjoyable sex.

16
00:00:46,627 --> 00:00:48,160
You're not having sex.

17
00:00:51,431 --> 00:00:53,632
Plus improves your reflexes.

18
00:00:54,801 --> 00:00:56,635
See, I would've caught that.

19
00:00:56,637 --> 00:00:59,037
Okay, you know what,
uh, how much is that?

20
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:00,973
It's only 25 bucks.
Wow.

21
00:01:00,975 --> 00:01:04,009
Um, okay.

22
00:01:45,151 --> 00:01:47,119
Pam, could I see you
in my office?

23
00:01:48,788 --> 00:01:51,990
Today, we're having performance
reviews company wide.

24
00:01:51,992 --> 00:01:53,292
Last year,
my performance review started

25
00:01:53,294 --> 00:01:54,893
Last year,
my performance review started

26
00:01:54,895 --> 00:01:58,263
with Michael asking me
what my hopes and dreams were,

27
00:01:58,265 --> 00:02:00,399
and it ended with him telling me

28
00:02:00,401 --> 00:02:02,267
he could bench-press
190 pounds.

29
00:02:03,936 --> 00:02:06,772
So I don't really know
what to expect.

30
00:02:06,774 --> 00:02:07,773
Pam, you're trustworthy.

31
00:02:07,775 --> 00:02:08,774
Thank you.

32
00:02:08,776 --> 00:02:13,178
And I want you to listen
to a voice mail from my boss.

33
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:15,881
Michael, it's Jan.

34
00:02:15,883 --> 00:02:17,215
I guess I missed you.

35
00:02:17,217 --> 00:02:19,217
I'll, uh, be there
this afternoon

36
00:02:19,219 --> 00:02:20,552
for performance reviews.

37
00:02:20,554 --> 00:02:22,621
I hope it's understood

38
00:02:22,623 --> 00:02:24,623
that that will be
our only topic of discussion.

39
00:02:24,625 --> 00:02:25,891
See you soon.

40
00:02:25,893 --> 00:02:27,959
First impressions?

41
00:02:27,961 --> 00:02:30,228
Uh, just off the top,

42
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:33,398
I think she'll be here
this afternoon.

43
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,567
My boss is coming in today.

44
00:02:35,569 --> 00:02:36,768
The lovely
Jan Levinson-Gould.

45
00:02:36,770 --> 00:02:38,637
Well, no Gould.

46
00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:40,772
The Gould has been divorce.

47
00:02:40,774 --> 00:02:42,874
Um, the awkward part

48
00:02:42,876 --> 00:02:44,843
is that this is the first time

49
00:02:44,845 --> 00:02:47,879
we'll be seeing each other
since...

50
00:02:47,881 --> 00:02:49,448
well...

51
00:02:49,450 --> 00:02:51,583
Uh, it was really nothing.

52
00:02:51,585 --> 00:02:53,618
We just sort of got
caught up in the moment.

53
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:57,289
The vulnerable divorcee
gives herself

54
00:02:57,291 --> 00:02:59,558
to the understanding
with rugged good looks

55
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:00,892
office manager.

56
00:03:00,894 --> 00:03:02,361
Just, uh,

57
00:03:02,363 --> 00:03:06,198
she didn't want it
to continue for some reason.

58
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:07,933
We both didn't...
I didn't want...

59
00:03:07,935 --> 00:03:09,768
we both didn't want it
to continue.

60
00:03:09,770 --> 00:03:12,104
It was not professional.

61
00:03:12,106 --> 00:03:14,506
Um, when people say
something's mutual,

62
00:03:14,508 --> 00:03:19,044
it never is,
but this was mutual.

63
00:03:19,046 --> 00:03:21,213
I guess I missed you.

64
00:03:21,215 --> 00:03:24,049
I guess I missed you.

65
00:03:24,051 --> 00:03:25,817
So she misses me.

66
00:03:25,819 --> 00:03:28,353
She missed you.

67
00:03:29,021 --> 00:03:31,189
But then she goes on to say,

68
00:03:31,191 --> 00:03:33,392
"That will be our only topic
of our discussion."

69
00:03:33,394 --> 00:03:34,626
That doesn't mean anything.

70
00:03:34,628 --> 00:03:35,794
Those are just words.

71
00:03:35,796 --> 00:03:37,829
I have one idea
of what it means.

72
00:03:37,831 --> 00:03:39,364
Okay. Yeah. What? What?

73
00:03:39,366 --> 00:03:40,565
Well, I don't think
you're going to be

74
00:03:40,567 --> 00:03:43,435
very happy with this.
Oh great.

75
00:03:43,437 --> 00:03:47,005
All right, well,
now I'm in a terrible mood.

76
00:03:47,007 --> 00:03:49,374
Let's do
your performance review.

77
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:51,276
Because she's conflicted.

78
00:03:51,278 --> 00:03:52,744
She has to be professional,

79
00:03:52,746 --> 00:03:56,448
but she's fighting
feelings for you.

80
00:03:56,450 --> 00:03:58,717
Ah. Why...
That's great news.

81
00:03:58,719 --> 00:04:01,086
That... that...
Then why would...

82
00:04:01,088 --> 00:04:02,487
why would I not like that?

83
00:04:02,489 --> 00:04:04,756
Um, just cause
that you work together,

84
00:04:04,758 --> 00:04:07,826
and it might be awkward.
Wow. Wow.

85
00:04:07,828 --> 00:04:10,695
All right, let's listen
to that again.

86
00:04:10,697 --> 00:04:12,030
Michael, it's Jan.

87
00:04:12,032 --> 00:04:13,532
I guess I missed you.

88
00:04:14,333 --> 00:04:15,634
Oh, hey.

89
00:04:15,636 --> 00:04:17,302
Listen, Jim.

90
00:04:17,304 --> 00:04:19,604
Here's a little tip
for your performance review.

91
00:04:19,606 --> 00:04:21,173
Okay.

92
00:04:21,175 --> 00:04:23,408
Tell Michael that we
should be stocking more

93
00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:26,244
of the double tabbed
manilla file folders.

94
00:04:26,246 --> 00:04:28,046
We don't have double tabbed
manilla files folders.

95
00:04:28,048 --> 00:04:29,548
Oh yes we do.
No, we don't.

96
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:30,882
Yeah, it's a new product.

97
00:04:30,884 --> 00:04:32,684
So you should just
suggest that to him,

98
00:04:32,686 --> 00:04:34,519
and then he'll be sure
to give you a raise.

99
00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:39,991
I'm gonna actually be asking
for a pay decrease.

100
00:04:39,993 --> 00:04:41,793
Uh, that is so stupid.

101
00:04:41,795 --> 00:04:43,795
What if he gives it to you?

102
00:04:43,797 --> 00:04:46,231
I win.
Ugh.

103
00:04:46,233 --> 00:04:47,499
You know what,

104
00:04:47,501 --> 00:04:49,968
I am going to zone you out
for the rest of today.

105
00:04:49,970 --> 00:04:51,102
I need to stay focused.

106
00:04:51,104 --> 00:04:52,471
And I don't have to see you

107
00:04:52,473 --> 00:04:53,839
tomorrow or Sunday.

108
00:04:53,841 --> 00:04:55,106
Please don't call me,

109
00:04:55,108 --> 00:04:56,374
and we'll see how things go
on Monday.

110
00:04:57,777 --> 00:05:00,078
Stupid.

111
00:05:01,013 --> 00:05:02,180
Wait, wait. One thing.

112
00:05:02,182 --> 00:05:05,517
Um, by tomorrow,
you mean Saturday, right?

113
00:05:05,519 --> 00:05:07,185
Uh, duh.

114
00:05:07,187 --> 00:05:09,020
Duh.

115
00:05:09,022 --> 00:05:10,388
Today is Thursday.

116
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:12,123
But Dwight thinks
that it's Friday.

117
00:05:12,125 --> 00:05:13,925
And that's what
I'll be working on

118
00:05:13,927 --> 00:05:15,861
this afternoon.

119
00:05:15,863 --> 00:05:17,896
Sometimes women say more
in their pauses

120
00:05:17,898 --> 00:05:19,664
than they say in their words.

121
00:05:19,666 --> 00:05:21,600
Really.
Oh yes.

122
00:05:21,602 --> 00:05:23,401
Let's listen to it again.

123
00:05:23,403 --> 00:05:25,737
And this time,
really listen to the pauses.

124
00:05:25,739 --> 00:05:27,539
God, Stanley,
that's freakin' brilliant.

125
00:05:27,541 --> 00:05:28,907
How do you know that?

126
00:05:28,909 --> 00:05:30,742
Did you learn that
on the streets?

127
00:05:30,744 --> 00:05:32,277
Sorry.

128
00:05:32,279 --> 00:05:34,746
Oh, it's okay.
I did learn it on the streets.

129
00:05:34,748 --> 00:05:36,448
On the ghetto, in fact.

130
00:05:37,450 --> 00:05:38,783
No kidding.

131
00:05:39,485 --> 00:05:41,286
It's all about my bonus.

132
00:05:43,589 --> 00:05:45,190
Michael and Jan
definitely made out. Oh.

133
00:05:45,192 --> 00:05:47,192
Maybe more.
Eck.

134
00:05:47,194 --> 00:05:49,761
Oh, also it is Thursday,

135
00:05:49,763 --> 00:05:51,129
but Dwight thinks it's Friday,

136
00:05:51,131 --> 00:05:52,964
so keep that going.

137
00:05:52,966 --> 00:05:54,332
Yay.

138
00:05:58,604 --> 00:06:00,272
Good work, Stanley.
Great performance review.

139
00:06:00,274 --> 00:06:02,541
Stanley in the house, everybody.

140
00:06:02,543 --> 00:06:03,842
Whoo!

141
00:06:03,844 --> 00:06:05,377
Angela, your turn.

142
00:06:05,379 --> 00:06:08,480
I actually look forward
to performance reviews.

143
00:06:08,482 --> 00:06:10,215
I did the youth beauty
pageant circuit.

144
00:06:10,217 --> 00:06:11,917
And I enjoyed that quite a bit.

145
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:15,554
I really enjoy being judged.

146
00:06:15,556 --> 00:06:20,392
I believe I hold up very well
to even severe scrutiny.

147
00:06:20,394 --> 00:06:21,693
Michael.
Yeah.

148
00:06:21,695 --> 00:06:23,528
Jan's on the phone for you.

149
00:06:23,530 --> 00:06:26,431
Oh. Angela, you were totally
satisfactory this year.

150
00:06:28,335 --> 00:06:29,834
Interesting.
Jan is calling me.

151
00:06:29,836 --> 00:06:32,837
Maybe it wasn't
so mutual after all.

152
00:06:32,839 --> 00:06:34,005
Yeah.

153
00:06:34,007 --> 00:06:35,173
Michael.

154
00:06:35,175 --> 00:06:37,475
Jan, to what do I owe
this pleasure?

155
00:06:37,477 --> 00:06:39,978
I am returning your many calls.

156
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:42,147
Well, hello to you too.

157
00:06:42,149 --> 00:06:44,282
Um, yeah, I was just, um,

158
00:06:44,284 --> 00:06:46,151
I just wanted to get
some closure

159
00:06:46,153 --> 00:06:49,821
on what transpired
between us at the meeting

160
00:06:49,823 --> 00:06:52,457
we had in the parking lot
of the Chili's.

161
00:06:55,162 --> 00:06:58,330
No. No. We... we won't be
discussing that, Michael.

162
00:06:58,332 --> 00:06:59,998
The only things
I want to talk about

163
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,466
during your performance review

164
00:07:01,468 --> 00:07:04,269
are your concrete ideas
to improve your branch.

165
00:07:04,271 --> 00:07:07,872
Well, surely this, uh, review

166
00:07:07,874 --> 00:07:11,576
is a formality because
of what happened, uh,

167
00:07:11,578 --> 00:07:13,845
at our meeting in the parking
lot of the Chili's.

168
00:07:13,847 --> 00:07:16,514
Review is anything but
a formality, Michael.

169
00:07:16,516 --> 00:07:19,718
And, uh, I expect you
to forget anything

170
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:22,454
that you think may have
happened between us

171
00:07:22,456 --> 00:07:25,857
and exhibit completely
professional behavior.

172
00:07:25,859 --> 00:07:26,958
Been thinking, about you.

173
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,326
Okay, that is an example

174
00:07:28,328 --> 00:07:30,528
of completely unprofessional
behavior.

175
00:07:30,530 --> 00:07:32,597
I don't see
how that's unprofessional.

176
00:07:32,599 --> 00:07:33,598
Michael.

177
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:36,968
Are the cameras in there
with you in your office?

178
00:07:36,970 --> 00:07:38,470
No, they are not.

179
00:07:40,706 --> 00:07:41,940
Yes, they are.

180
00:07:45,411 --> 00:07:47,245
That's my girlfriend.

181
00:07:47,247 --> 00:07:50,849
I heard they made out
and had sex.

182
00:07:50,851 --> 00:07:53,318
I heard they just made out.
That's it.

183
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:57,656
Well, I heard they made out...

184
00:07:57,658 --> 00:07:59,224
and had sex.

185
00:07:59,226 --> 00:08:00,859
Don't talk about it.

186
00:08:01,694 --> 00:08:03,294
Office romances
are nobody's business

187
00:08:03,296 --> 00:08:05,530
but the people involved.

188
00:08:08,134 --> 00:08:09,834
Romances?

189
00:08:10,836 --> 00:08:13,004
Pam, I have ideas
on a daily business.

190
00:08:13,006 --> 00:08:14,706
I know I do.

191
00:08:14,708 --> 00:08:17,909
I have a clear memory
of telling people my ideas.

192
00:08:17,911 --> 00:08:19,744
Um, is there any chance

193
00:08:19,746 --> 00:08:21,913
that you wrote
any of my ideas down

194
00:08:21,915 --> 00:08:23,915
in a folder like a idea folder?

195
00:08:23,917 --> 00:08:25,550
Sorry.

196
00:08:25,552 --> 00:08:27,652
That's unfortunate.

197
00:08:27,654 --> 00:08:30,088
How about the suggestion box?

198
00:08:30,090 --> 00:08:31,389
There's tons of ideas in there.

199
00:08:31,391 --> 00:08:32,624
What suggestion box?

200
00:08:32,626 --> 00:08:34,993
The suggestion box
that I put out,

201
00:08:34,995 --> 00:08:36,995
and people could put in
suggestions anonymously.

202
00:08:36,997 --> 00:08:38,997
Maybe there's prizes.

203
00:08:38,999 --> 00:08:40,498
Oh, yeah.

204
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,734
I-I think I remember that
from back when I first started.

205
00:08:42,736 --> 00:08:43,802
Why don't you find it

206
00:08:43,804 --> 00:08:45,670
and then tell people
to get theirs...

207
00:08:45,672 --> 00:08:46,771
Never mind. I'll tell them.

208
00:08:46,773 --> 00:08:47,972
Hello, everybody.

209
00:08:47,974 --> 00:08:49,574
Yeah. Uh, attention,
please.

210
00:08:49,576 --> 00:08:51,009
Jan Levinson's coming

211
00:08:51,011 --> 00:08:52,210
very soon.

212
00:08:52,212 --> 00:08:53,611
And so we're going to have

213
00:08:53,613 --> 00:08:55,580
our weekly suggestion box
meeting.

214
00:08:55,582 --> 00:08:58,717
So you can all get in
your constructive compliments

215
00:08:58,719 --> 00:08:59,951
ASAP.

216
00:08:59,953 --> 00:09:01,686
Don't you mean
constructive criticism?

217
00:09:01,688 --> 00:09:02,754
What did I say?

218
00:09:02,756 --> 00:09:04,055
You said constructive
compliments.

219
00:09:04,057 --> 00:09:07,759
Well, Kelly, that was neither
constructive nor a compliment.

220
00:09:07,761 --> 00:09:10,595
So maybe you should stop
criticizing my English

221
00:09:10,597 --> 00:09:12,831
and start making
some suggestions.

222
00:09:12,833 --> 00:09:14,299
Okay?

223
00:09:14,301 --> 00:09:15,600
Hey, Dan, this is Jim.

224
00:09:15,602 --> 00:09:17,736
It is about 11:15
and I wanted to know

225
00:09:17,738 --> 00:09:19,104
what you were up to tomorrow,

226
00:09:19,106 --> 00:09:22,941
which is the 15th
and that is a...

227
00:09:22,943 --> 00:09:24,642
Saturday.
Saturday.

228
00:09:24,644 --> 00:09:26,678
So just let me know
what you're doing tomorrow,

229
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:28,346
Saturday, for lunch.

230
00:09:28,348 --> 00:09:30,148
Okay, talk to you soon.

231
00:09:37,523 --> 00:09:38,623
Okay, bye-bye.

232
00:09:39,592 --> 00:09:41,159
Would you please tell Michael
that I'm here?

233
00:09:41,161 --> 00:09:42,160
Sure.

234
00:09:42,162 --> 00:09:44,195
Hi, Jan.
How are you?

235
00:09:44,197 --> 00:09:45,630
Hi, Michael.
I'm good. How are you.

236
00:09:45,632 --> 00:09:46,698
Good to see you.
Nice to see you.

237
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:47,799
Okay.

238
00:09:47,801 --> 00:09:50,935
Okay, why don't we
just step into my off...

239
00:09:50,937 --> 00:09:52,504
We're going to go in here.

240
00:09:52,506 --> 00:09:53,671
Can we please go
into your office?

241
00:09:53,673 --> 00:09:55,607
Right after you.

242
00:09:55,609 --> 00:09:57,075
Après vous.

243
00:10:05,584 --> 00:10:07,152
Oh, thank you.

244
00:10:07,154 --> 00:10:08,319
It's nice to see you.

245
00:10:08,321 --> 00:10:09,554
Nice to see you too, Michael.

246
00:10:09,556 --> 00:10:10,655
Really?

247
00:10:10,657 --> 00:10:11,823
Not like that.

248
00:10:11,825 --> 00:10:13,691
Oh, well...

249
00:10:13,693 --> 00:10:15,627
You know, Michael,
I think I need to make

250
00:10:15,629 --> 00:10:16,895
something clear
right off the top.

251
00:10:16,897 --> 00:10:19,063
I'm not going to discuss
anything with you

252
00:10:19,065 --> 00:10:21,032
other than Dunder Mifflin
business.

253
00:10:21,034 --> 00:10:22,734
All right.
Period.

254
00:10:22,736 --> 00:10:24,002
Do we understand each other?

255
00:10:24,004 --> 00:10:25,336
Absolutely.

256
00:10:25,338 --> 00:10:26,604
I'm a little confused

257
00:10:26,606 --> 00:10:28,106
because first it's all like
kissy kissy.

258
00:10:28,108 --> 00:10:29,407
And then it's like all regret.

259
00:10:29,409 --> 00:10:30,775
Because, oh, I regret that.

260
00:10:30,777 --> 00:10:32,744
But wait, I'm still
going to call you

261
00:10:32,746 --> 00:10:35,780
but... but we're just
going to talk business.

262
00:10:35,782 --> 00:10:38,116
And I may come down there
and fire you

263
00:10:38,118 --> 00:10:39,651
if you don't do your job.

264
00:10:39,653 --> 00:10:42,453
But what were we talking
about when we first kissed?

265
00:10:42,455 --> 00:10:44,322
Business.

266
00:10:44,324 --> 00:10:45,824
So are you still in the middle

267
00:10:45,826 --> 00:10:46,991
of the performance reviews then?

268
00:10:46,993 --> 00:10:48,059
No, no, no.

269
00:10:48,061 --> 00:10:49,127
I finished all of that.
I'm very fast.

270
00:10:49,129 --> 00:10:50,562
I'm not too fast.

271
00:10:50,564 --> 00:10:52,163
Not like wham, bam,
thank you, ma'am.

272
00:10:52,165 --> 00:10:54,032
But I do say thank you, ma'am.

273
00:10:54,034 --> 00:10:57,869
I'm not like, wham, bam.

274
00:10:57,871 --> 00:10:59,637
Not that there's anything
wrong with wham, bam

275
00:10:59,639 --> 00:11:00,839
if it's consensual.

276
00:11:03,242 --> 00:11:05,476
We're talking
about office stuff.

277
00:11:07,479 --> 00:11:08,947
Can I ask you a question?

278
00:11:08,949 --> 00:11:10,048
No.

279
00:11:10,050 --> 00:11:11,282
This is a business question.

280
00:11:11,284 --> 00:11:13,585
It's nothing personal.
I promise.

281
00:11:13,587 --> 00:11:14,719
Fine.

282
00:11:14,721 --> 00:11:17,422
Are you wearing
new perfume today?

283
00:11:19,425 --> 00:11:20,758
How is that a business question?

284
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:22,493
Well, you're wearing it
at the office.

285
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:24,195
And...
It...

286
00:11:24,197 --> 00:11:27,131
I'm sorry, no offense,
but it's really sexy.

287
00:11:27,133 --> 00:11:28,900
Please don't smell me, Michael.

288
00:11:33,405 --> 00:11:34,672
Hey, Jim.
Hey, how's it going?

289
00:11:34,674 --> 00:11:35,840
Oh, my God.

290
00:11:35,842 --> 00:11:37,242
Did you seed The Apprentice
last night?

291
00:11:37,244 --> 00:11:38,710
Of course.
It's on every Thursday night.

292
00:11:38,712 --> 00:11:40,044
So how can I miss it?

293
00:11:40,046 --> 00:11:41,346
Can you believe who Trump fired?

294
00:11:41,348 --> 00:11:42,513
No.
That was unbelievable.

295
00:11:42,515 --> 00:11:43,615
Who? Who was it?

296
00:11:43,617 --> 00:11:44,649
Who did he fire?

297
00:11:44,651 --> 00:11:45,850
You didn't see it?
No.

298
00:11:45,852 --> 00:11:47,385
I went out and got drunk

299
00:11:47,387 --> 00:11:48,853
with my laser tag team
last night.

300
00:11:48,855 --> 00:11:50,054
Crap.

301
00:11:50,056 --> 00:11:51,923
I never go out
on a Thursday night.

302
00:11:51,925 --> 00:11:53,391
What the hell was I thinking?

303
00:11:54,894 --> 00:11:56,027
I don't understand...

304
00:11:57,297 --> 00:11:58,796
Hold on. Sorry.

305
00:11:58,798 --> 00:12:00,331
Yes, Pam.

306
00:12:00,333 --> 00:12:02,500
Michael, it's time
for the suggestion box meeting.

307
00:12:02,502 --> 00:12:04,135
I'm kind of in the middle
of something.

308
00:12:04,137 --> 00:12:05,637
I wish you wouldn't interrupt.

309
00:12:05,639 --> 00:12:07,005
You told me to buzz you

310
00:12:07,007 --> 00:12:08,139
about the suggestion box meeting

311
00:12:08,141 --> 00:12:09,274
when Jan was here.

312
00:12:09,276 --> 00:12:11,409
I did not... not use
those words.

313
00:12:11,411 --> 00:12:13,444
Uh, I'd like to sit in
on that meeting.

314
00:12:13,446 --> 00:12:14,579
Is it happening right now?

315
00:12:14,581 --> 00:12:16,014
No, it's in, like, 10 minutes.

316
00:12:16,016 --> 00:12:17,282
Everyone's waiting
in the conference room.

317
00:12:17,284 --> 00:12:19,884
Great. Very good.

318
00:12:24,990 --> 00:12:26,291
Why are we here?

319
00:12:26,293 --> 00:12:28,826
Because I value your opinions.

320
00:12:28,828 --> 00:12:30,061
Now I know a lot of you
don't think

321
00:12:30,063 --> 00:12:31,562
that I read your suggestions,

322
00:12:31,564 --> 00:12:32,864
but I do.

323
00:12:32,866 --> 00:12:34,365
I just sift through them
every week.

324
00:12:34,367 --> 00:12:37,468
And I really look and scrutinize

325
00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:39,604
to see what you guys
are writing.

326
00:12:39,606 --> 00:12:42,507
Um, so let's just, uh,

327
00:12:42,509 --> 00:12:43,574
read some of these suckers,
okay?

328
00:12:43,576 --> 00:12:44,709
All right.

329
00:12:44,711 --> 00:12:46,110
Number one, what should we do

330
00:12:46,112 --> 00:12:47,545
to prepare for Y2K?

331
00:12:47,547 --> 00:12:50,081
What should we do
to prepare for Y2K?

332
00:12:50,083 --> 00:12:51,816
I thought you read these
every week?

333
00:12:51,818 --> 00:12:53,651
Well, obviously,
this one got stuck in the box.

334
00:12:53,653 --> 00:12:55,219
That happens occasionally.

335
00:12:55,221 --> 00:12:57,255
It happens occasionally.

336
00:12:57,257 --> 00:12:59,757
And, um, so one down.

337
00:12:59,759 --> 00:13:02,226
Next suggestion.

338
00:13:02,228 --> 00:13:03,795
We need better outreach

339
00:13:03,797 --> 00:13:05,797
for employees
fighting depression.

340
00:13:05,799 --> 00:13:08,633
Okay. All right.
Enough with the jokes.

341
00:13:08,635 --> 00:13:10,868
Nobody in here
is suffering from depression.

342
00:13:10,870 --> 00:13:12,704
That sounds serious, Michael.

343
00:13:12,706 --> 00:13:14,772
Oh. Okay. Well, yeah.

344
00:13:14,774 --> 00:13:15,907
Who wrote it?
Tom.

345
00:13:15,909 --> 00:13:17,608
Tom. Then it is a joke

346
00:13:17,610 --> 00:13:20,244
because there is nobody
in here named Tom.

347
00:13:20,246 --> 00:13:22,914
Tom? He worked in accounting
up until about a year ago.

348
00:13:24,249 --> 00:13:26,217
Tom.

349
00:13:28,187 --> 00:13:30,955
Oh, that guy.
That guy was weird.

350
00:13:30,957 --> 00:13:32,090
All right, next suggestion.

351
00:13:32,092 --> 00:13:33,758
Next suggestion.

352
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:35,893
Ar, badoo badoo.

353
00:13:35,895 --> 00:13:37,795
You need to do something
about your B.O.

354
00:13:37,797 --> 00:13:40,365
You need to do something
about your B.O.

355
00:13:40,367 --> 00:13:43,001
Okay, now I don't know who this
suggestion is meant for,

356
00:13:43,003 --> 00:13:45,770
but it's more
of a personal suggestion.

357
00:13:45,772 --> 00:13:47,505
And it's not an office
suggestion.

358
00:13:47,507 --> 00:13:49,874
Far be it from me
to use this as a platform

359
00:13:49,876 --> 00:13:51,042
to embarrass anybody.

360
00:13:51,044 --> 00:13:54,379
Aren't the suggestions
meant for you?

361
00:13:54,381 --> 00:13:55,913
Well, Toby,

362
00:13:55,915 --> 00:14:00,585
if by me you are inferring
that I have B.O.,

363
00:14:00,587 --> 00:14:03,988
then I would say that that
is a very poor choice of words.

364
00:14:03,990 --> 00:14:05,556
Uh, Michael,

365
00:14:05,558 --> 00:14:06,891
he wasn't inferring,
he was implying.

366
00:14:06,893 --> 00:14:08,593
You were inferring.

367
00:14:08,595 --> 00:14:09,727
Was I, Creed?

368
00:14:09,729 --> 00:14:12,563
Okay, well, you know
what I am implying

369
00:14:12,565 --> 00:14:15,266
is that when we're on
an elevator together,

370
00:14:15,268 --> 00:14:17,402
I should maybe take the stairs

371
00:14:17,404 --> 00:14:19,470
because talk about stank.

372
00:14:19,472 --> 00:14:20,838
Not that I would ever

373
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:22,106
say something like that
in public

374
00:14:22,108 --> 00:14:24,042
and I never have
and I never will,

375
00:14:24,044 --> 00:14:25,309
I just think it's something

376
00:14:25,311 --> 00:14:27,979
that we should all
be aware of, okay?

377
00:14:27,981 --> 00:14:29,981
Now that we've learned this,

378
00:14:29,983 --> 00:14:31,282
let's continue.

379
00:14:31,284 --> 00:14:32,450
See, this is good.

380
00:14:32,452 --> 00:14:33,684
We're learning,

381
00:14:33,686 --> 00:14:34,886
and we're figuring
some stuff out.

382
00:14:34,888 --> 00:14:36,754
You need to do something
about your coffee breath.

383
00:14:36,756 --> 00:14:39,057
You need to do... Shut up. Shut up.
Shut up, Dwight.

384
00:14:39,059 --> 00:14:41,559
Okay, I don't think
you people are grasping

385
00:14:41,561 --> 00:14:44,896
the concept
of the suggestion box.

386
00:14:44,898 --> 00:14:47,432
Sometimes you talk to us
real close.

387
00:14:47,434 --> 00:14:50,068
Yeah? Is that hard
for you?

388
00:14:50,070 --> 00:14:52,403
All right. Well, when you have
coffee breath, it's hard.

389
00:14:53,772 --> 00:14:55,106
Let's k...
let's keep going.

390
00:14:56,241 --> 00:14:57,241
Yup.

391
00:14:57,243 --> 00:14:58,810
What do we have here?

392
00:14:58,812 --> 00:15:00,344
We have...

393
00:15:00,346 --> 00:15:01,946
somebody's piece of gum.

394
00:15:01,948 --> 00:15:03,614
Somebody put a piece
of gum in there.

395
00:15:03,616 --> 00:15:05,416
This is not a-a garbage can.

396
00:15:05,418 --> 00:15:07,485
This is the future
of our company.

397
00:15:07,487 --> 00:15:10,488
This is not a place
for gum, okay?

398
00:15:10,490 --> 00:15:12,490
I don't want to have
to read these tomorrow...

399
00:15:12,492 --> 00:15:14,425
Yeah, who wants to come in
on a Saturday?

400
00:15:14,427 --> 00:15:17,261
Yeah. What? No.
All right.

401
00:15:17,263 --> 00:15:19,564
Next suggestion.
Next suggestion.

402
00:15:21,366 --> 00:15:22,867
Don't...
Okay, that's blank.

403
00:15:22,869 --> 00:15:24,068
Don't... Just...

404
00:15:24,070 --> 00:15:25,670
Don't sleep with your boss.

405
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:29,140
Do you think this is referring

406
00:15:29,142 --> 00:15:30,708
to you boning Jan?

407
00:15:32,444 --> 00:15:34,212
I can't... I can't... I don't
understand why you're so upset.

408
00:15:34,214 --> 00:15:36,914
I'm going to sit over here.
You're going to sit over there.

409
00:15:36,916 --> 00:15:38,549
Let me ask you this.
Please sit yourself down.

410
00:15:38,551 --> 00:15:42,153
Let me ask you something.
Where did you get your outfit?

411
00:15:44,891 --> 00:15:46,457
You're gonna give me this raise.

412
00:15:46,459 --> 00:15:49,293
I deserve this raise.

413
00:15:49,295 --> 00:15:53,231
Yes. Yes! Yes!

414
00:15:53,233 --> 00:15:54,432
Ha!

415
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:56,400
The least you can do

416
00:15:56,402 --> 00:15:58,236
is keep my salary consistent
with inflation.

417
00:15:58,238 --> 00:16:00,037
Kah-ah!

418
00:16:00,039 --> 00:16:02,740
Yes! Why are you going
to give me this raise?

419
00:16:02,742 --> 00:16:04,375
Why?

420
00:16:05,878 --> 00:16:08,312
Because I'm awesome!

421
00:16:08,314 --> 00:16:11,082
I am awesome!

422
00:16:11,084 --> 00:16:13,184
I just don't understand

423
00:16:13,186 --> 00:16:16,154
why you have to pretend
like nothing happened.

424
00:16:16,156 --> 00:16:17,788
Because nothing did, Michael.

425
00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:19,757
I'm not going

426
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:21,092
to say anything more about it,

427
00:16:21,094 --> 00:16:22,927
and I would advise
that you do the same.

428
00:16:22,929 --> 00:16:24,061
Look.

429
00:16:24,063 --> 00:16:25,263
Michael.
Oh my God.

430
00:16:25,265 --> 00:16:26,430
I'm sorry.
I'm interrupting.

431
00:16:26,432 --> 00:16:28,266
Oh God.
Were you guys making out?

432
00:16:28,268 --> 00:16:30,268
No, Dwight. Come in.
Great.

433
00:16:30,270 --> 00:16:31,402
What do you want, Dwight?

434
00:16:31,404 --> 00:16:33,804
I am ready
for my performance review.

435
00:16:33,806 --> 00:16:34,972
Okay. Great.

436
00:16:34,974 --> 00:16:36,674
Your performance
has been adequate.

437
00:16:36,676 --> 00:16:38,042
You may leave.

438
00:16:38,044 --> 00:16:39,477
Good-bye.

439
00:16:39,479 --> 00:16:41,112
Is this how
you've been conducting

440
00:16:41,114 --> 00:16:42,513
all the reviews, Michael?

441
00:16:42,515 --> 00:16:43,981
You want to talk now?
Good.

442
00:16:43,983 --> 00:16:45,316
Okay, Dwight, leave.

443
00:16:45,318 --> 00:16:46,417
Uh, wait.

444
00:16:46,419 --> 00:16:48,019
I would like to discuss
my raise.

445
00:16:48,021 --> 00:16:50,321
Why on earth
would we give you a raise?

446
00:16:50,323 --> 00:16:51,489
That is an excellent question.

447
00:16:51,491 --> 00:16:53,124
Thank you for asking.

448
00:16:55,627 --> 00:16:57,628
Let me bring up one word.

449
00:16:57,630 --> 00:16:58,796
Dedication.

450
00:16:59,898 --> 00:17:01,666
I have never...

451
00:17:01,668 --> 00:17:03,134
been late.

452
00:17:03,136 --> 00:17:05,970
Also I have never
missed a day due to illness.

453
00:17:05,972 --> 00:17:08,906
Even when I had walking
pneumonia.

454
00:17:08,908 --> 00:17:11,209
I even come in on holidays.

455
00:17:11,211 --> 00:17:12,643
You do?

456
00:17:12,645 --> 00:17:13,844
How do you get in?

457
00:17:13,846 --> 00:17:15,513
I have a copy of your key.

458
00:17:15,515 --> 00:17:17,615
That's a serious offense.

459
00:17:17,617 --> 00:17:19,317
That is a serious offense.
Very serious.

460
00:17:19,319 --> 00:17:22,320
As is toying with a man's heart.

461
00:17:22,322 --> 00:17:24,155
Oh, Michael, for God sakes.

462
00:17:24,157 --> 00:17:26,257
I'd also further like to talk
about my merits

463
00:17:26,259 --> 00:17:27,592
in the workplace.

464
00:17:27,594 --> 00:17:29,427
Okay, third wheel,
why don't you do that?

465
00:17:29,429 --> 00:17:31,262
For instance, the time
I brought in deer jerky

466
00:17:31,264 --> 00:17:32,430
for the whole office.

467
00:17:32,432 --> 00:17:33,731
That was deer? Gross.

468
00:17:33,733 --> 00:17:35,099
You liked it.
Oh God. Did not.

469
00:17:35,101 --> 00:17:36,300
Jan, have you ever had deer?

470
00:17:36,302 --> 00:17:38,669
No.
It's a delicacy.

471
00:17:38,671 --> 00:17:40,137
And, you know what,
it's an aphrodisiac.

472
00:17:40,139 --> 00:17:41,505
So when we're done here,

473
00:17:41,507 --> 00:17:43,341
you guys could go over
to the Antler Lodge,

474
00:17:43,343 --> 00:17:44,942
sample some deer,
and talk about my raise.

475
00:17:44,944 --> 00:17:46,277
What do you say, Jan?

476
00:17:46,279 --> 00:17:47,678
Okay. Here's what
I'm going to do.

477
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:49,213
I'm going to step outside,

478
00:17:49,215 --> 00:17:50,548
collect my thoughts,

479
00:17:50,550 --> 00:17:52,216
and I will return
in about 10 minutes.

480
00:17:52,218 --> 00:17:53,284
Okay, you just, uh,
clear your head.

481
00:17:53,286 --> 00:17:54,418
Thank you, Dwight.

482
00:17:55,687 --> 00:17:57,121
Look. I know it's your job.

483
00:17:57,123 --> 00:17:58,422
I know you have to ask.

484
00:17:58,424 --> 00:17:59,657
But I promise you,

485
00:17:59,659 --> 00:18:01,325
I'm not going to discuss it
with him.

486
00:18:01,327 --> 00:18:03,160
I'm certainly not
going to discuss it with you.

487
00:18:03,162 --> 00:18:05,162
Do you have a light?

488
00:18:05,164 --> 00:18:06,297
And in conclusion,

489
00:18:06,299 --> 00:18:08,566
I think Lex Luther said it best

490
00:18:08,568 --> 00:18:12,503
when he said,
"Dad, you have no idea

491
00:18:12,505 --> 00:18:13,704
what I'm capable of."

492
00:18:13,706 --> 00:18:15,106
That's from Superman?

493
00:18:15,108 --> 00:18:16,240
Smallville.

494
00:18:16,242 --> 00:18:20,378
And that is why I feel I deserve

495
00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:21,812
this raise.

496
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:28,085
Do you think Michael and Jan
actually...

497
00:18:28,087 --> 00:18:29,587
I don't really want
to picture it,

498
00:18:29,589 --> 00:18:30,855
but thank you, Pam.

499
00:18:30,857 --> 00:18:33,557
How do you come back from that?

500
00:18:33,559 --> 00:18:37,261
Um, you don't, I don't think,
come all the way back, you know.

501
00:18:37,263 --> 00:18:39,430
Especially working together.

502
00:18:39,432 --> 00:18:40,931
No, I mean,
doing that with Michael.

503
00:18:40,933 --> 00:18:42,700
How do you come back from that

504
00:18:42,702 --> 00:18:43,968
as a human being?

505
00:18:43,970 --> 00:18:46,704
Oh. Yeah. No.
I don't think you can.

506
00:18:46,706 --> 00:18:48,272
I'm heading back

507
00:18:48,274 --> 00:18:49,573
to New York.

508
00:18:49,575 --> 00:18:51,575
Allan and I will conduct
your performance review

509
00:18:51,577 --> 00:18:53,077
over the phone tomorrow, okay?

510
00:18:53,079 --> 00:18:54,278
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

511
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:56,580
No, no. I just... I just want
to know why.

512
00:18:56,582 --> 00:18:59,583
Michael, now is not
the time or the place.

513
00:18:59,585 --> 00:19:02,119
Okay. So you're saying
that there is a different time

514
00:19:02,121 --> 00:19:03,754
or place that we can have
this discussion.

515
00:19:03,756 --> 00:19:06,023
No, I am saying we are never
gonna have this conversation.

516
00:19:06,025 --> 00:19:09,260
Well, okay.
Never as in never ever ever?

517
00:19:09,262 --> 00:19:10,928
Or never as in
there's no chance?

518
00:19:10,930 --> 00:19:13,331
Never for me
always means never ever ever.

519
00:19:13,333 --> 00:19:15,533
I just want to know
from the horse's mouth

520
00:19:15,535 --> 00:19:18,269
what is the dealio.
You know, Michael...

521
00:19:18,271 --> 00:19:21,138
Am I too short? Michael, it has
nothing to do with your looks, okay?

522
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:22,540
It's your personality.

523
00:19:22,542 --> 00:19:23,641
I mean, you're obnoxious

524
00:19:23,643 --> 00:19:27,244
and rude
and... and... and stupid.

525
00:19:27,246 --> 00:19:28,913
And you do have coffee breath

526
00:19:28,915 --> 00:19:30,081
by the way.

527
00:19:30,083 --> 00:19:32,583
And... and I don't agree
about the B.O.

528
00:19:32,585 --> 00:19:35,820
But you are very, very
inconsiderate.

529
00:19:35,822 --> 00:19:36,821
Really?

530
00:19:36,823 --> 00:19:38,022
Really.

531
00:19:38,024 --> 00:19:39,190
You're... you're... you're...

532
00:19:39,192 --> 00:19:40,791
you're a great guy, okay?

533
00:19:40,793 --> 00:19:42,660
I appreciate that.
Thank you.

534
00:19:42,662 --> 00:19:43,961
You were very sweet.

535
00:19:43,963 --> 00:19:46,597
And you stayed up with me
and talked to me

536
00:19:46,599 --> 00:19:48,632
and cried with me
and I appreciate that.

537
00:19:48,634 --> 00:19:50,034
No, I wasn't.

538
00:19:50,036 --> 00:19:51,168
I wasn't crying.

539
00:19:51,170 --> 00:19:53,204
But I am just not
in the place right now

540
00:19:53,206 --> 00:19:55,206
where I'm looking
for a relationship.

541
00:19:55,208 --> 00:19:56,707
So we can still work together,

542
00:19:56,709 --> 00:20:00,277
we can still be friends, but...

543
00:20:00,279 --> 00:20:02,279
Okay?

544
00:20:02,281 --> 00:20:06,117
So my looks
having nothing to do with it.

545
00:20:11,556 --> 00:20:13,758
Jan is not in a place
where she feels

546
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:15,626
she can have a relationship
right now.

547
00:20:15,628 --> 00:20:19,330
And it doesn't matter
how great a guy I am.

548
00:20:19,332 --> 00:20:21,031
And that is all I needed.

549
00:20:21,033 --> 00:20:24,168
I'm good.
I can go home now.

550
00:20:33,311 --> 00:20:35,880
Hey, it's 12:20.
Where the hell is Dwight?

551
00:20:35,882 --> 00:20:38,349
Um, no idea.

552
00:20:38,351 --> 00:20:41,085
Never missed a day my ass.

553
00:20:51,029 --> 00:20:53,931
I'm here! I'm here!

554
00:20:55,667 --> 00:20:57,735
I'm here! It's okay!
