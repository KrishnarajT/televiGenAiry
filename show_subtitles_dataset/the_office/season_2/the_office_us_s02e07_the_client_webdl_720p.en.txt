1
00:00:00,894 --> 00:00:03,529
Hey, have they left for the big meeting
yet? I got Michael's lucky tie.

2
00:00:03,531 --> 00:00:05,731
No, they're in
the conference room.

3
00:00:05,733 --> 00:00:07,233
Okay.

4
00:00:07,235 --> 00:00:08,801
Wait, are those Michael's Levis?

5
00:00:08,803 --> 00:00:11,036
Yeah.
Who dry-cleans jeans?

6
00:00:11,038 --> 00:00:13,305
Michael and his jeans.

7
00:00:13,307 --> 00:00:15,207
He gets in them and...

8
00:00:15,209 --> 00:00:16,876
I'm not exactly sure
what happens,

9
00:00:16,878 --> 00:00:20,346
but I can tell you,
he loves the way he looks

10
00:00:20,348 --> 00:00:22,114
in those jeans.

11
00:00:22,116 --> 00:00:24,817
I know that's why
he started casual Fridays.

12
00:00:24,819 --> 00:00:26,352
I'll take those.

13
00:00:26,354 --> 00:00:30,356
Thanks.

14
00:01:04,691 --> 00:01:07,760
This is a projection
of the county's needs.

15
00:01:07,762 --> 00:01:10,930
Wow, graphs and charts.

16
00:01:10,932 --> 00:01:12,898
Somebody's really
been doing their homework.

17
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:14,700
Looks like USA Today.

18
00:01:14,702 --> 00:01:16,936
13 schools, 2 hospitals...

19
00:01:16,938 --> 00:01:18,971
So this possible client
they're talking about.

20
00:01:18,973 --> 00:01:20,172
Actually, a big deal.

21
00:01:20,174 --> 00:01:21,974
It's Lackawanna County.

22
00:01:21,976 --> 00:01:23,909
Our whole county.

23
00:01:23,911 --> 00:01:25,177
And if we get this,

24
00:01:25,179 --> 00:01:29,081
they might not have
to downsize our branch.

25
00:01:29,083 --> 00:01:31,617
And I could work here for years.

26
00:01:32,819 --> 00:01:37,489
And years and... years.

27
00:01:37,491 --> 00:01:39,925
So, when we get
to the Radisson, I'd like to...

28
00:01:39,927 --> 00:01:41,660
Oh, I changed it to Chili's.

29
00:01:42,595 --> 00:01:43,829
Excuse me?

30
00:01:43,831 --> 00:01:46,231
Radisson just gives out
this vibe.

31
00:01:46,233 --> 00:01:48,167
It's like, "Oh, I'm doing
business at the Radisson."

32
00:01:48,169 --> 00:01:50,836
It's kinda snooty, so...

33
00:01:50,838 --> 00:01:52,004
You had no right
to do that, Michael.

34
00:01:52,006 --> 00:01:53,839
Here's the thing, Chili's...

35
00:01:53,841 --> 00:01:56,141
is the new golf course.

36
00:01:56,143 --> 00:01:57,810
It's where business happens.

37
00:01:58,478 --> 00:02:01,046
Small Businessman Magazine.

38
00:02:01,048 --> 00:02:02,114
It said that.

39
00:02:02,116 --> 00:02:03,282
It will.
I sent it in.

40
00:02:03,284 --> 00:02:04,450
Letter to the editor.

41
00:02:05,919 --> 00:02:07,553
All right.

42
00:02:07,555 --> 00:02:10,055
But you will let me
run this meeting.

43
00:02:10,057 --> 00:02:11,056
Mmmm.
Mm-hmm.

44
00:02:11,058 --> 00:02:12,358
Mm-hmm.
Power trip.

45
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:15,961
She had done
a background check on me.

46
00:02:15,963 --> 00:02:17,363
She had it printed out.

47
00:02:17,365 --> 00:02:18,664
No.
Yeah.

48
00:02:18,666 --> 00:02:20,699
And she was asking
me about stuff line by line

49
00:02:20,701 --> 00:02:21,800
while we were having dinner.

50
00:02:21,802 --> 00:02:23,068
That is unbelievable.

51
00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:24,203
What's going on?

52
00:02:24,205 --> 00:02:26,505
We are doing worst first dates.

53
00:02:26,507 --> 00:02:28,307
Oh, my God.
I win.

54
00:02:28,309 --> 00:02:30,676
Okay, it was a minor league
hockey game.

55
00:02:30,678 --> 00:02:32,544
He brought his brother.

56
00:02:32,546 --> 00:02:33,812
And when I went to the bathroom,

57
00:02:33,814 --> 00:02:35,547
the game ended,
and they forgot about me.

58
00:02:35,549 --> 00:02:36,615
Okay, that's a joke.

59
00:02:36,617 --> 00:02:38,951
No, they had
to come back for me.

60
00:02:38,953 --> 00:02:40,886
Wait, when was this?

61
00:02:41,554 --> 00:02:42,888
Um...

62
00:02:44,524 --> 00:02:46,458
It was not that long ago.

63
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:47,659
Wait, not Roy.

64
00:02:47,661 --> 00:02:50,195
Say it's not your fiancÃ©.

65
00:02:52,666 --> 00:02:55,100
I always knew Pam
has refused to go

66
00:02:55,102 --> 00:02:56,902
to sports games with Roy.

67
00:02:56,904 --> 00:02:59,304
But I never knew why.

68
00:03:00,807 --> 00:03:02,007
Interesting.

69
00:03:02,009 --> 00:03:04,476
Okay, let's do this thing.

70
00:03:04,478 --> 00:03:05,878
Wish us luck.

71
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:07,312
Good luck, Michael.
Good luck, Jan.

72
00:03:07,314 --> 00:03:08,514
Thank you.
Kiss ass.

73
00:03:08,516 --> 00:03:11,750
Okay, probably going
to go late tonight.

74
00:03:11,752 --> 00:03:13,619
Burning the midnight tequila.

75
00:03:13,621 --> 00:03:16,155
So I think you all
could just take off now.

76
00:03:16,157 --> 00:03:18,023
Michael, this shouldn't
take more than an hour.

77
00:03:18,025 --> 00:03:19,191
Well...

78
00:03:19,193 --> 00:03:20,559
Do you always shut down
the entire office

79
00:03:20,561 --> 00:03:21,794
when you leave for an hour?

80
00:03:22,495 --> 00:03:23,529
No, no.

81
00:03:23,531 --> 00:03:25,330
That would not be efficient.

82
00:03:25,332 --> 00:03:27,232
Actually, they just don't get
very much work done

83
00:03:27,234 --> 00:03:28,567
when I'm not here.

84
00:03:30,503 --> 00:03:33,505
That's not true.
I know how to delegate.

85
00:03:33,507 --> 00:03:36,508
And they do more work
when I'm not here.

86
00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:39,411
Not more...
the same amount of work...

87
00:03:39,413 --> 00:03:41,947
is done whether I am here
or not.

88
00:03:43,683 --> 00:03:44,783
Hey, everybody, listen up!

89
00:03:44,785 --> 00:03:46,251
This is what we're gonna do.

90
00:03:46,253 --> 00:03:49,621
You sit tight until
I return, sound good?

91
00:03:49,623 --> 00:03:52,491
Doesn't matter.
It's an order.

92
00:03:52,493 --> 00:03:54,359
Follow it blindly.
Mm-ha-ha!

93
00:03:54,361 --> 00:03:56,795
Okay?

94
00:03:56,797 --> 00:03:58,497
All right, ciao.

95
00:03:58,499 --> 00:04:00,599
Adios!

96
00:04:00,601 --> 00:04:02,568
So which way is Chili's?

97
00:04:02,570 --> 00:04:04,503
Ah, I'll drive.
No, that's all right.

98
00:04:04,505 --> 00:04:05,537
I wanna leave
straight from there.

99
00:04:05,539 --> 00:04:06,738
It just a couple blocks away.

100
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:08,807
So... boy, you really
don't know Scranton, do you?

101
00:04:08,809 --> 00:04:10,509
I know Scranton.
At all.

102
00:04:10,511 --> 00:04:12,244
Have you ever been
to Scranton, Jen?

103
00:04:12,246 --> 00:04:15,013
If it's a couple blocks away,
we can go together.

104
00:04:15,015 --> 00:04:17,749
Jan Levinson-Gould.

105
00:04:17,751 --> 00:04:19,318
Jan is cold.

106
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:20,752
If she was sitting
across from you on a train,

107
00:04:20,754 --> 00:04:23,155
and she wasn't moving,
you might think she was dead.

108
00:04:24,290 --> 00:04:26,825
We should come up with
a signal of some sort.

109
00:04:26,827 --> 00:04:27,926
Why would we need a signal?

110
00:04:27,928 --> 00:04:29,561
Well, in case one of us
gets into trouble,

111
00:04:29,563 --> 00:04:31,029
the other one can signal and...

112
00:04:31,031 --> 00:04:32,331
What kind of trouble are you
planning on

113
00:04:32,333 --> 00:04:33,699
getting in, Michael?

114
00:04:33,701 --> 00:04:35,134
Well, it could be either of us.

115
00:04:35,136 --> 00:04:36,435
You're gonna let me
do the talking,

116
00:04:36,437 --> 00:04:37,903
we agreed on that.

117
00:04:37,905 --> 00:04:39,605
Yes.

118
00:04:42,675 --> 00:04:44,276
Hello?
Christian?

119
00:04:44,278 --> 00:04:45,611
Yes.
I thought that was you.

120
00:04:45,613 --> 00:04:46,812
Hi.
Hi.

121
00:04:46,814 --> 00:04:48,514
Michael Scott,
this is Jan Levinson-Gould.

122
00:04:48,516 --> 00:04:50,382
Just Jan Levinson.

123
00:04:50,384 --> 00:04:51,483
No Gould?
No.

124
00:04:51,485 --> 00:04:53,152
Thank you very much
for meeting with us.

125
00:04:53,154 --> 00:04:54,453
Have you been waiting long?

126
00:04:54,455 --> 00:04:55,487
No, not long.

127
00:04:55,489 --> 00:04:57,055
Good.
Uh, Jan, what happened?

128
00:04:57,057 --> 00:04:58,857
Michael...
Is Gould dead?

129
00:04:58,859 --> 00:05:00,659
What, uh...
Michael.

130
00:05:00,661 --> 00:05:02,027
We got divorced, okay?

131
00:05:02,029 --> 00:05:04,062
I'm so sorry, excuse me.
Wow, you're kidding me.

132
00:05:04,064 --> 00:05:05,197
Do you wanna talk about it?

133
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:06,431
Michael.

134
00:05:06,433 --> 00:05:07,966
Could we have
a table for three please?

135
00:05:07,968 --> 00:05:09,334
When did this happen?

136
00:05:09,336 --> 00:05:10,602
We're in a meeting.
Okay.

137
00:05:10,604 --> 00:05:11,637
This way, please.

138
00:05:11,639 --> 00:05:13,038
All right, after you.

139
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,740
Thank you.

140
00:05:19,412 --> 00:05:20,746
I thought we could start

141
00:05:20,748 --> 00:05:21,980
by going over
the needs of the county.

142
00:05:21,982 --> 00:05:23,348
Right.

143
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:25,484
Well, Lackawanna County
has not been immune

144
00:05:25,486 --> 00:05:29,454
to the slow economic growth
of the past five years.

145
00:05:29,456 --> 00:05:33,759
So for us, the name of the game
is budget reduction.

146
00:05:33,761 --> 00:05:35,260
Awesome Blossom?

147
00:05:35,262 --> 00:05:36,461
What?

148
00:05:36,463 --> 00:05:37,529
I think we should share
an Awesome Blossom.

149
00:05:37,531 --> 00:05:39,097
What do you say?
They are awesome.

150
00:05:39,099 --> 00:05:41,066
You want to, Christian?
Awesome?

151
00:05:41,068 --> 00:05:43,268
Sure.
Okay, it's done.

152
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:46,238
Actually, Megan, may we have
an Awesome Blossom, please?

153
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,706
Extra awesome?

154
00:05:47,708 --> 00:05:48,774
Now it is done.

155
00:05:48,776 --> 00:05:49,975
So, if you have...

156
00:05:49,977 --> 00:05:52,277
Hey, I heard a very very
funny joke...

157
00:05:52,279 --> 00:05:53,979
the other day.
You wanna hear it?

158
00:05:53,981 --> 00:05:56,982
Christian, you don't
have to listen to this.

159
00:05:56,984 --> 00:05:58,550
It's okay.
I like jokes.

160
00:05:58,552 --> 00:05:59,651
Okay.

161
00:05:59,653 --> 00:06:00,786
Just the one.

162
00:06:00,788 --> 00:06:02,621
Just one joke?
Okay.

163
00:06:02,623 --> 00:06:04,356
Well, if it's just
gonna be one...

164
00:06:04,358 --> 00:06:07,559
I will think of
a different joke.

165
00:06:07,561 --> 00:06:08,694
Um...

166
00:06:11,864 --> 00:06:13,098
Dunder Miflin, this is Pam.

167
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:14,166
Pam, it's Michael.

168
00:06:14,168 --> 00:06:15,734
I need you to go into my office

169
00:06:15,736 --> 00:06:17,236
and check some data for me.

170
00:06:17,238 --> 00:06:20,372
Okay, um, you want me
to read 'em?

171
00:06:20,374 --> 00:06:21,673
Yes.

172
00:06:21,675 --> 00:06:24,109
Okay, um, a fisherman
is walking down 5th Avenue

173
00:06:24,111 --> 00:06:25,611
leading an animal behind him.

174
00:06:25,613 --> 00:06:27,112
Nope!
Nope, hold it.

175
00:06:27,114 --> 00:06:28,580
Not as good as you think.
Pick another one.

176
00:06:28,582 --> 00:06:29,881
Okay.

177
00:06:29,883 --> 00:06:31,783
There's a transcript
between a Naval ship and...

178
00:06:31,785 --> 00:06:33,952
Oh, hey!
Bingo.

179
00:06:33,954 --> 00:06:35,053
And a lighthouse.

180
00:06:35,055 --> 00:06:36,388
Yes, that is hysterical.

181
00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:37,789
Could you start that one
from the beginning?

182
00:06:37,791 --> 00:06:39,124
Sure.

183
00:06:39,126 --> 00:06:40,459
There's a transcript
between a naval ship

184
00:06:40,461 --> 00:06:42,094
and a lighthouse.

185
00:07:01,314 --> 00:07:02,481
Is this real?

186
00:07:02,483 --> 00:07:04,516
It is a screenplay...

187
00:07:04,518 --> 00:07:05,851
starring himself.

188
00:07:05,853 --> 00:07:07,619
Agent Michael Scarn.

189
00:07:07,621 --> 00:07:09,187
Of the F.B.I.

190
00:07:09,189 --> 00:07:10,656
How long is this?

191
00:07:10,658 --> 00:07:14,726
Oh, Pam, good work.

192
00:07:14,728 --> 00:07:16,695
Oh, wait, stop.

193
00:07:16,697 --> 00:07:18,030
Drawings.

194
00:07:18,032 --> 00:07:19,064
What is that?

195
00:07:19,066 --> 00:07:21,833
Oh, those are drawings in case

196
00:07:21,835 --> 00:07:24,136
the writing didn't really
put a picture in your head.

197
00:07:24,138 --> 00:07:26,038
And there he is in the flesh,

198
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:28,106
Agent Michael Scarn.

199
00:07:28,108 --> 00:07:29,841
Now we know what he looks like.

200
00:07:29,843 --> 00:07:32,911
First guy says,
"Well, I'm an astronaut,

201
00:07:32,913 --> 00:07:34,313
so I drive a Saturn."

202
00:07:34,315 --> 00:07:37,182
And the second guy says,
"Well, I am a pimp,

203
00:07:37,184 --> 00:07:39,618
so I drive a cheap Escort."

204
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:41,453
And the third guy says,
"I got you both beat.

205
00:07:41,455 --> 00:07:46,358
I'm a proctologist
so I drive a brown Probe."

206
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:49,094
Oh, no!

207
00:07:50,963 --> 00:07:53,198
Oh, my God, that's funny!

208
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:56,034
I almost had Awesome Blossom
coming out of my nose!

209
00:07:57,571 --> 00:07:59,304
Excuse me, could I have
a vodka tonic, please?

210
00:07:59,306 --> 00:08:02,007
Do we all have our copy
of Threat Level Midnight

211
00:08:02,009 --> 00:08:03,141
by Michael Scott?

212
00:08:05,378 --> 00:08:07,346
All right,
let's get this started.

213
00:08:07,348 --> 00:08:09,414
I'm gonna be reading
the action descriptions.

214
00:08:09,416 --> 00:08:11,350
And Phyllis, I would
like you to play

215
00:08:11,352 --> 00:08:12,584
Catherine Zeta-Jones.

216
00:08:12,586 --> 00:08:14,086
That's the character's name?

217
00:08:14,088 --> 00:08:16,121
Okay, you guys should not
be doing this!

218
00:08:16,123 --> 00:08:17,322
Why not, Dwight?

219
00:08:17,324 --> 00:08:18,657
This is a movie.

220
00:08:18,659 --> 00:08:21,159
I mean, this is for all
of America to enjoy.

221
00:08:21,161 --> 00:08:23,328
You took something
that doesn't belong to you.

222
00:08:23,330 --> 00:08:24,863
Dwight. Brought it in here,
made copies of it...

223
00:08:24,865 --> 00:08:27,632
Do you want to play
the lead role

224
00:08:27,634 --> 00:08:29,401
of Agent Michael Scarn?

225
00:08:31,537 --> 00:08:33,238
Arrgh!
Num num num.

226
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,773
That's delicious!

227
00:08:34,775 --> 00:08:36,274
I love it.

228
00:08:36,276 --> 00:08:39,177
We would probably
be upset with ourselves

229
00:08:39,179 --> 00:08:41,813
if we went this whole night
without talking business.

230
00:08:41,815 --> 00:08:44,750
So Dunder Miflin can provide...

231
00:08:44,752 --> 00:08:47,419
a level of personal service
to the county

232
00:08:47,421 --> 00:08:50,288
That the warehouse chains
just can't match.

233
00:08:50,290 --> 00:08:52,090
Well, we are out to save money.

234
00:08:52,092 --> 00:08:53,091
What's the bottom line?

235
00:08:53,093 --> 00:08:54,226
Blah!
Blah blah blah.

236
00:08:54,228 --> 00:08:55,861
Blu bad be bah.

237
00:08:55,863 --> 00:09:00,132
That's why I wanted
a signal between us.

238
00:09:00,134 --> 00:09:02,768
So I wouldn't have
to just shout nonsense words.

239
00:09:02,770 --> 00:09:04,336
That's her fault.

240
00:09:04,338 --> 00:09:09,141
Did somebody say baby back ribs?

241
00:09:09,143 --> 00:09:11,009
Hmm?
Hmm?

242
00:09:11,011 --> 00:09:13,945
I don't think Christian
has time for that, Michael.

243
00:09:13,947 --> 00:09:15,814
I have time.

244
00:09:24,425 --> 00:09:26,892
Inside the F.B.I.,
Agent Michael Scarn

245
00:09:26,894 --> 00:09:28,493
sits with his feet
up on his desk.

246
00:09:28,495 --> 00:09:30,462
Catherine Zeta-Jones enters.

247
00:09:30,464 --> 00:09:32,330
Sir, you have some messages.

248
00:09:32,332 --> 00:09:34,599
Not now!
They're important.

249
00:09:34,601 --> 00:09:36,935
Okay, what are they?

250
00:09:36,937 --> 00:09:38,937
The first message is...
I love you.

251
00:09:38,939 --> 00:09:40,439
That's from me.

252
00:09:40,441 --> 00:09:42,073
Not in 1,000 years, Catherine.

253
00:09:42,075 --> 00:09:43,141
We work together.

254
00:09:43,143 --> 00:09:44,810
And get off my desk.

255
00:09:44,812 --> 00:09:46,812
Yes, I have acted before.

256
00:09:46,814 --> 00:09:49,681
I was in a production of
Oklahoma in the seventh grade.

257
00:09:49,683 --> 00:09:53,485
I played the part
of Mutie the mailman.

258
00:09:53,487 --> 00:09:54,920
They had too many kids,

259
00:09:54,922 --> 00:09:57,689
so they make up roles like that.

260
00:09:57,691 --> 00:09:58,857
I was good.

261
00:09:58,859 --> 00:10:00,559
If it isn't my old partner,

262
00:10:00,561 --> 00:10:03,161
Samuel L. Chang.

263
00:10:03,163 --> 00:10:06,431
Agent Michael Scarn,
you lost some weight.

264
00:10:06,433 --> 00:10:09,634
Thank you for noticing.

265
00:10:09,636 --> 00:10:11,903
Now, keep me company
for one more mission.

266
00:10:11,905 --> 00:10:14,840
Hey, I have to work late.

267
00:10:15,842 --> 00:10:17,742
You're joking, right?

268
00:10:17,744 --> 00:10:19,110
Michael Scarn takes out
a nine millimeter gun

269
00:10:19,112 --> 00:10:20,979
and shoots the cake to bits.

270
00:10:22,749 --> 00:10:26,785
Ha ha ha, Agent Michael Scarn,
you so funny.

271
00:10:26,787 --> 00:10:27,919
Word.

272
00:10:27,921 --> 00:10:29,588
Michael's movie?

273
00:10:29,590 --> 00:10:31,556
Two thumbs down.

274
00:10:38,865 --> 00:10:40,832
A man sitting several seats down

275
00:10:40,834 --> 00:10:43,602
who has a gold face
turns to Michael Scarn.

276
00:10:43,604 --> 00:10:45,303
Uh, ooh.

277
00:10:45,305 --> 00:10:48,707
Oscar, you wanna play
Goldenface?

278
00:10:48,709 --> 00:10:50,909
Mr. Scarn, perhaps you would
be comfortable

279
00:10:50,911 --> 00:10:52,043
in my private jet.

280
00:10:52,045 --> 00:10:54,546
Yes, perhaps I would,
Goldenface.

281
00:10:54,548 --> 00:10:55,981
Sam, get my luggage.

282
00:10:55,983 --> 00:10:57,916
I forget it, brotha.

283
00:10:57,918 --> 00:10:59,651
Samuel, you are such an idiot!

284
00:10:59,653 --> 00:11:01,186
You are the worst
assistant ever.

285
00:11:01,188 --> 00:11:02,854
And you're disgusting, Dwigt.

286
00:11:02,856 --> 00:11:05,690
Wait, who's Dwigt?

287
00:11:06,425 --> 00:11:08,627
Here's what we think happened.

288
00:11:08,629 --> 00:11:10,629
Michael's sidekick,
who all through the movie

289
00:11:10,631 --> 00:11:13,198
is this complete idiot
who's causing the downfall

290
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,400
of the United States...

291
00:11:15,402 --> 00:11:17,402
was originally named Dwight.

292
00:11:17,404 --> 00:11:20,338
But then Michael changed it
to Samuel L. Chang

293
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:22,374
using a search and replace.

294
00:11:22,376 --> 00:11:24,509
But that doesn't work
on misspelled words.

295
00:11:24,511 --> 00:11:27,178
Leaving behind one Dwigt.

296
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:29,681
And Dwight figured it out.

297
00:11:29,683 --> 00:11:30,882
Oops.

298
00:11:30,884 --> 00:11:34,386
D-W-I-G-H-T.

299
00:11:34,388 --> 00:11:35,420
Okay, you know what?

300
00:11:35,422 --> 00:11:36,588
I am done with this.

301
00:11:36,590 --> 00:11:38,223
That's it, the end.

302
00:11:38,225 --> 00:11:40,825
Well, some of us
wanna keep reading, so...

303
00:11:40,827 --> 00:11:42,727
Uh, you don't speak
for everyone, Jim.

304
00:11:42,729 --> 00:11:44,529
Okay, announcement.

305
00:11:44,531 --> 00:11:46,731
My uncle bought me
some fireworks.

306
00:11:46,733 --> 00:11:48,867
And anyone who wants
to see a real show

307
00:11:48,869 --> 00:11:50,602
come with me outside now.

308
00:11:50,604 --> 00:11:52,604
That's actually a good idea.

309
00:11:52,606 --> 00:11:53,738
We'll all take
a brief intermission.

310
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:55,740
Hey, are you hungry?

311
00:11:55,742 --> 00:11:57,409
Yeah.
Yeah?

312
00:11:57,411 --> 00:12:00,745
And so after watching my mom
go through so much pain,

313
00:12:00,747 --> 00:12:04,049
I decided to keep that promise
that I made to her.

314
00:12:04,051 --> 00:12:06,217
And take care of her.

315
00:12:06,219 --> 00:12:07,485
Hoo.

316
00:12:07,487 --> 00:12:09,387
Well, this brings us to Jan.

317
00:12:09,389 --> 00:12:10,555
Truth or dare.

318
00:12:10,557 --> 00:12:12,190
Tell us about your divorce.

319
00:12:12,192 --> 00:12:13,625
Oh, no, Michael.
Michael, Michael.

320
00:12:13,627 --> 00:12:15,927
Do, do. Michael, please.
No really.

321
00:12:15,929 --> 00:12:17,662
Oh, hey.
So you're not gonna play.

322
00:12:17,664 --> 00:12:20,031
She's not playing. She's not
playing the game. That's not fair.

323
00:12:20,033 --> 00:12:21,366
We'd been fighting for a while.

324
00:12:21,368 --> 00:12:22,434
He didn't want kids.

325
00:12:22,436 --> 00:12:23,535
I knew that going into it.

326
00:12:23,537 --> 00:12:25,136
But he also knew that I did.

327
00:12:25,138 --> 00:12:26,771
So I guess I thought
that he would change his mind.

328
00:12:26,773 --> 00:12:28,340
He thought that I
would change mine.

329
00:12:28,342 --> 00:12:30,008
You didn't.

330
00:12:30,010 --> 00:12:31,776
I was stupid.

331
00:12:31,778 --> 00:12:35,547
No.
No, you were not stupid.

332
00:12:35,549 --> 00:12:36,815
Gould was stupid, right?

333
00:12:36,817 --> 00:12:37,816
That's right.

334
00:12:37,818 --> 00:12:39,818
You were really brave.

335
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:42,053
I mean, you put
your arms out there.

336
00:12:42,055 --> 00:12:44,055
You slit your wrist.

337
00:12:44,057 --> 00:12:46,458
You said, "World, this is
my blood, it's red.

338
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:49,761
Just like yours,
so love me."

339
00:12:51,497 --> 00:12:53,798
I had plans
to meet a friend tonight.

340
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:55,300
Which I had to cancel.

341
00:12:55,302 --> 00:12:57,002
But this is cool too.

342
00:12:57,004 --> 00:12:58,803
I'm not a complainer.

343
00:13:03,843 --> 00:13:06,578
Wow.
For the bugs.

344
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:07,646
Nice.

345
00:13:07,648 --> 00:13:11,650
That's excellent
because bugs love...

346
00:13:11,652 --> 00:13:13,018
my famous grilled cheese
sandwich.

347
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:16,054
Yes!
Nice.

348
00:13:16,056 --> 00:13:18,857
I can't remember the last time
someone made me dinner.

349
00:13:23,896 --> 00:13:25,196
Whoa!

350
00:13:25,198 --> 00:13:27,565
Yeah!
Whoo! Whoo!

351
00:13:29,602 --> 00:13:32,437
Yeah!
Ha!

352
00:13:32,439 --> 00:13:33,471
Whoo-hoo!

353
00:13:33,473 --> 00:13:35,807
Right down the street?
Mm-hmm.

354
00:13:35,809 --> 00:13:37,642
Kenneth Road, born and raised.

355
00:13:37,644 --> 00:13:39,044
Spent my whole life

356
00:13:39,046 --> 00:13:40,679
right here in Lackawanna county.

357
00:13:40,681 --> 00:13:43,114
And I do not intend on moving.

358
00:13:43,116 --> 00:13:44,315
I know this place.

359
00:13:44,317 --> 00:13:46,151
I know how many
hospitals we have.

360
00:13:46,153 --> 00:13:48,753
I know how many schools we have.

361
00:13:48,755 --> 00:13:49,888
It's home, you know?

362
00:13:49,890 --> 00:13:51,656
I know the challenges

363
00:13:51,658 --> 00:13:53,491
that this county's up against.

364
00:13:53,493 --> 00:13:55,493
Here's the thing about
those discount suppliers,

365
00:13:55,495 --> 00:13:56,628
they don't care.

366
00:13:56,630 --> 00:13:59,364
They come in,
they undercut everything.

367
00:13:59,366 --> 00:14:01,199
And they run us out of business.

368
00:14:01,201 --> 00:14:03,401
And then, once we're all gone,

369
00:14:03,403 --> 00:14:04,969
they jack up the prices.
I know.

370
00:14:04,971 --> 00:14:06,071
It's bad.
It's terrible.

371
00:14:06,073 --> 00:14:08,506
It is... your know what?
It really is.

372
00:14:08,508 --> 00:14:09,908
Uh...

373
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:12,077
I don't know.

374
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:14,312
I guess I could give you guys
our business,

375
00:14:14,314 --> 00:14:16,014
but you have
to meet me halfway, okay?

376
00:14:16,016 --> 00:14:19,084
Because they're expecting me
to make cuts.

377
00:14:19,086 --> 00:14:22,587
Well, corporate's gonna
go ballistic,

378
00:14:22,589 --> 00:14:26,858
but you think we could, Jan?

379
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:30,929
So, I guess I'll see you in...

380
00:14:30,931 --> 00:14:32,130
10 hours.

381
00:14:32,132 --> 00:14:33,998
What are you gonna do
with your time off?

382
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,467
Travel.
Yeah.

383
00:14:35,469 --> 00:14:38,136
I've been looking forward to it.

384
00:14:38,138 --> 00:14:41,673
It's gonna be...
really nice.

385
00:14:41,675 --> 00:14:43,842
I'm gonna find myself.

386
00:14:43,844 --> 00:14:45,276
You have new music?

387
00:14:45,278 --> 00:14:48,346
Yeah.
Definitely.

388
00:14:58,858 --> 00:15:00,425
See ya!
Bye!

389
00:15:00,427 --> 00:15:01,860
Good-bye!

390
00:15:02,728 --> 00:15:04,529
Thanks.

391
00:15:05,731 --> 00:15:06,898
Yes!
We did it.

392
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:08,967
We got it!
Nailed it, nailed it!

393
00:15:08,969 --> 00:15:11,669
Come here.

394
00:15:11,671 --> 00:15:15,206
I am really... thrilled.

395
00:15:29,421 --> 00:15:30,955
Let's go.

396
00:15:30,957 --> 00:15:32,190
What?
Let's go.

397
00:15:32,192 --> 00:15:34,159
Go and... okay.
Where are we going?

398
00:15:34,161 --> 00:15:35,527
Doesn't matter.

399
00:15:35,529 --> 00:15:38,096
Goin' to the go-go.

400
00:15:38,098 --> 00:15:39,764
Okay.

401
00:15:49,642 --> 00:15:52,010
Michael?

402
00:15:59,585 --> 00:16:00,952
Michael?

403
00:16:04,390 --> 00:16:05,490
Michael?

404
00:16:12,631 --> 00:16:14,899
His car's not
in the parking lot.

405
00:16:14,901 --> 00:16:16,601
I should check
the accident reports.

406
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:20,905
Who's this?

407
00:16:22,174 --> 00:16:23,842
Jan?

408
00:16:43,229 --> 00:16:45,263
Morning, Pam.

409
00:16:46,232 --> 00:16:47,298
Hey.

410
00:16:48,801 --> 00:16:50,501
No, nothing happened.

411
00:16:52,771 --> 00:16:54,873
I swear!

412
00:16:54,875 --> 00:16:56,341
Nothing happened.

413
00:16:56,343 --> 00:17:00,778
What... I'm totally
being serious.

414
00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:03,648
A gentleman does not
kiss and tell.

415
00:17:03,650 --> 00:17:06,384
And neither do I.

416
00:17:06,386 --> 00:17:07,452
I'm...

417
00:17:07,454 --> 00:17:09,420
No, seriously, guys, I'm not...

418
00:17:09,422 --> 00:17:12,190
I don't wanna go into it at all.

419
00:17:12,192 --> 00:17:14,058
It's off limits.

420
00:17:15,628 --> 00:17:17,161
Fine, I took her back
to her hotel,

421
00:17:17,163 --> 00:17:18,630
and we made out
for a little while.

422
00:17:18,632 --> 00:17:20,198
It was great.

423
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:21,466
I mean, she told me
about her divorce.

424
00:17:21,468 --> 00:17:22,800
We talked for about five hours.

425
00:17:22,802 --> 00:17:25,103
She fell asleep on my arm.

426
00:17:30,843 --> 00:17:32,010
Hello, Dwight.

427
00:17:32,012 --> 00:17:33,044
Did you do her?

428
00:17:33,046 --> 00:17:34,913
Who?

429
00:17:34,915 --> 00:17:36,981
Jan Levinson-Gould.

430
00:17:36,983 --> 00:17:41,219
Uh, no, no, no Gould.

431
00:17:41,221 --> 00:17:42,253
Did you do her?

432
00:17:42,255 --> 00:17:44,255
This is none of your affair.

433
00:17:44,257 --> 00:17:45,423
Because she is your boss.

434
00:17:45,425 --> 00:17:46,424
And she is your boss.

435
00:17:46,426 --> 00:17:48,192
And she is a woman.

436
00:17:48,194 --> 00:17:53,998
She is a strong, soft,
thoughtful, sexy woman.

437
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,533
And you know what?

438
00:17:55,535 --> 00:17:56,734
I don't think I can sit here

439
00:17:56,736 --> 00:17:58,903
and let you
talk about her that way

440
00:17:58,905 --> 00:18:00,838
without me defending her honor.

441
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:03,508
Jan, I defend your honor.

442
00:18:03,510 --> 00:18:04,575
Is that all?

443
00:18:09,548 --> 00:18:12,183
Jan didn't come back
for her car last night.

444
00:18:12,185 --> 00:18:14,152
What?

445
00:18:14,154 --> 00:18:16,454
Could it be
that Agent Michael Scarn

446
00:18:16,456 --> 00:18:18,289
has finally found
his Catherine Zeta?

447
00:18:18,291 --> 00:18:20,425
Oh, I don't know...

448
00:18:22,262 --> 00:18:24,395
Oh, my God.
This is Jan's cell.

449
00:18:24,397 --> 00:18:25,530
No way.

450
00:18:27,132 --> 00:18:28,766
Dunder Miflin, this is Pam.

451
00:18:28,768 --> 00:18:31,402
I know we have to register

452
00:18:31,404 --> 00:18:34,339
as a consensual
sexual relationship with HR.

453
00:18:34,341 --> 00:18:37,875
My question, do I do it
as the man,

454
00:18:37,877 --> 00:18:39,477
does she do it as my superior?

455
00:18:39,479 --> 00:18:40,912
I don't know.

456
00:18:40,914 --> 00:18:43,281
That leads to other issues
that we may have

457
00:18:43,283 --> 00:18:45,183
in our relationship.

458
00:18:45,185 --> 00:18:46,317
It's, uh...

459
00:18:46,319 --> 00:18:47,785
Excuse me.

460
00:18:47,787 --> 00:18:49,020
Hello?

461
00:18:49,022 --> 00:18:52,190
Hi.
Just talking about you.

462
00:18:52,192 --> 00:18:53,858
The camera.
No.

463
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:54,926
Uh-huh.

464
00:18:55,527 --> 00:18:56,961
How's traffic?

465
00:18:56,963 --> 00:18:58,229
I miss you.
What?

466
00:18:59,832 --> 00:19:00,898
Okay.

467
00:19:02,835 --> 00:19:07,672
Well, if it was a mistake,
it was a wonderful mistake.

468
00:19:10,275 --> 00:19:13,678
No.
Just...

469
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:15,980
No, I did not intentionally
get you drunk.

470
00:19:18,517 --> 00:19:19,751
Mm-hmm.

471
00:19:20,686 --> 00:19:22,320
No, no.

472
00:19:22,322 --> 00:19:24,155
This is just a fight.

473
00:19:24,157 --> 00:19:25,690
This is just a first fight
of many fights

474
00:19:25,692 --> 00:19:28,326
we're gonna have.

475
00:19:28,328 --> 00:19:30,795
Right.

476
00:19:30,797 --> 00:19:32,063
No.

477
00:19:32,065 --> 00:19:33,564
You... I don't understand.

478
00:19:33,566 --> 00:19:35,433
You wanna see other people.

479
00:19:35,435 --> 00:19:36,868
Only other people.

480
00:19:36,870 --> 00:19:38,669
Wha... okay.

481
00:19:38,671 --> 00:19:40,238
I think you're still
a little bit drunk.

482
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:41,839
Excuse me.
Excuse me?

483
00:19:43,075 --> 00:19:45,143
I think you're sti... yes.

484
00:19:45,145 --> 00:19:46,477
Why don't you just
come back here?

485
00:19:46,479 --> 00:19:48,112
We can go to the hotel.

486
00:19:48,114 --> 00:19:49,447
Have a few drinks.

487
00:19:49,449 --> 00:19:51,449
No, I didn't slip you something!

488
00:19:51,451 --> 00:19:54,485
Some might even say we had
our first date last night.

489
00:19:54,487 --> 00:19:56,721
Oh, really?
Really.

490
00:19:56,723 --> 00:19:58,122
Why might some say that?

491
00:19:58,124 --> 00:20:02,226
'Cause there was dinner.
By candlelight.

492
00:20:02,228 --> 00:20:05,430
Dinner and a show
if you include Michael's movie.

493
00:20:05,432 --> 00:20:08,866
And there was
dancing and fireworks.

494
00:20:08,868 --> 00:20:09,901
Pretty good date.

495
00:20:09,903 --> 00:20:11,135
We didn't dance.

496
00:20:12,571 --> 00:20:13,638
You're right, we didn't dance.

497
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:15,640
It was more like... swaying.

498
00:20:17,142 --> 00:20:18,409
But still romantic.

499
00:20:18,411 --> 00:20:20,011
Swaying isn't dancing.

500
00:20:22,247 --> 00:20:25,750
At least I didn't leave you
at a high school hockey game.

501
00:20:30,622 --> 00:20:32,924
I have some faxes to get out.

502
00:20:35,294 --> 00:20:36,861
Oh, come on.
Pam, I'm...

503
00:20:38,363 --> 00:20:40,331
Okay, we didn't dance.

504
00:20:40,333 --> 00:20:42,800
And I was totally joking,
anyway.

505
00:20:42,802 --> 00:20:44,836
I mean, it's not really
a date if the girl

506
00:20:44,838 --> 00:20:46,804
goes home to her fiancÃ©.

507
00:20:48,373 --> 00:20:49,440
Right?
