1
00:00:03,788 --> 00:00:06,321
Dunder Miflin, this is Pam.

2
00:00:07,891 --> 00:00:09,892
Sure, can I ask who's calling?

3
00:00:11,094 --> 00:00:12,628
Just a second.

4
00:00:15,666 --> 00:00:16,665
Jim Halpert.

5
00:00:16,667 --> 00:00:17,699
What?

6
00:00:17,701 --> 00:00:19,802
How did you get this number?

7
00:00:19,804 --> 00:00:20,869
Stalker.

8
00:00:20,871 --> 00:00:23,138
Katie and Jim met in the office.

9
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:25,374
And now I guess
they're, like, going out

10
00:00:25,376 --> 00:00:27,142
or dating or something.

11
00:00:27,144 --> 00:00:28,744
And, uh...

12
00:00:30,113 --> 00:00:31,747
I don't know, you know?

13
00:00:31,749 --> 00:00:35,217
They're just... she calls him
and they... you know.

14
00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:37,286
I'm sorry, I feel like
I'm talking really loud.

15
00:00:37,288 --> 00:00:38,454
Am I talking really loud?

16
00:00:38,456 --> 00:00:39,755
So we're still on for lunch?

17
00:00:39,757 --> 00:00:41,090
You're meeting me here?

18
00:00:41,092 --> 00:00:42,558
Okay.

19
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:44,827
Great.
Bye.

20
00:00:46,229 --> 00:00:47,629
Hey.

21
00:00:47,631 --> 00:00:49,598
You can just give her
your extension.

22
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,100
Okay.

23
00:01:24,901 --> 00:01:27,436
Howard slash Ryan.

24
00:01:27,438 --> 00:01:29,538
Ryan Howard is sitting
in my office.

25
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:32,074
And he has been a temp here
for a couple of months.

26
00:01:32,076 --> 00:01:35,043
And he's kind of gotten
the lay of the land

27
00:01:35,045 --> 00:01:36,378
a little bit.

28
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:37,646
A few laughs along the way.

29
00:01:37,648 --> 00:01:41,183
And now he wants to know
what I think.

30
00:01:41,185 --> 00:01:44,686
The temp agency
wants to know what you think.

31
00:01:44,688 --> 00:01:47,356
Shall we?
Let us proceed.

32
00:01:47,358 --> 00:01:50,292
First up, proficiency
in necessary skills.

33
00:01:52,228 --> 00:01:55,030
Eeeeeeaaa...

34
00:01:55,032 --> 00:01:58,534
Excellent!

35
00:02:01,571 --> 00:02:03,705
Michael's in there right now
evaluating the temp.

36
00:02:03,707 --> 00:02:07,943
He hasn't evaluated me in years.

37
00:02:07,945 --> 00:02:09,711
Five years from now,
what do you wanna do?

38
00:02:09,713 --> 00:02:12,748
Where do you wanna be? Uh, well,
I'm interested in business.

39
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:13,916
Oh, good.

40
00:02:13,918 --> 00:02:15,684
Ambitious.
Excellent.

41
00:02:16,553 --> 00:02:18,320
Wanna be a manager?

42
00:02:18,322 --> 00:02:20,389
Uh, no, actually
what I want is to own

43
00:02:20,391 --> 00:02:21,523
my own company.

44
00:02:21,525 --> 00:02:23,225
That is ridiculous.

45
00:02:24,727 --> 00:02:25,928
Ryan's about to attend

46
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:28,797
the Michael Scott
school of business.

47
00:02:28,799 --> 00:02:32,401
I'm like Mr. Miyagi and Yoda
rolled into one.

48
00:02:32,403 --> 00:02:34,636
Much advice you seek.

49
00:02:36,539 --> 00:02:37,639
You know who that is?

50
00:02:39,576 --> 00:02:41,276
Fozzy Bear?

51
00:02:44,714 --> 00:02:47,249
No, that was Yoda.

52
00:02:47,251 --> 00:02:51,620
There are ten rules of business
that you need to learn.

53
00:02:51,622 --> 00:02:52,788
Number one...

54
00:02:54,824 --> 00:02:57,326
You need to play to win...

55
00:02:57,328 --> 00:03:03,832
but you also have to win
to play.

56
00:03:05,335 --> 00:03:06,602
Got it.

57
00:03:06,604 --> 00:03:09,438
And I will give you
the rest of the ten at lunch.

58
00:03:13,676 --> 00:03:14,977
Hey, tch tch.

59
00:03:19,649 --> 00:03:21,650
Michael and I have
a very special connection.

60
00:03:21,652 --> 00:03:23,852
He's like Batman,
I'm like Robin.

61
00:03:23,854 --> 00:03:26,588
He's like The Lone Ranger,
and I'm like Tonto.

62
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:28,323
And it's not like there was
The Lone Ranger

63
00:03:28,325 --> 00:03:30,392
and Tonto and Bonto.

64
00:03:41,772 --> 00:03:42,771
People!

65
00:03:42,773 --> 00:03:43,772
Okay!
Everybody?

66
00:03:43,774 --> 00:03:44,940
This is not a test!

67
00:03:44,942 --> 00:03:46,241
Go to the exits!

68
00:03:46,243 --> 00:03:47,576
Do not panic!

69
00:03:47,578 --> 00:03:49,177
Get up off your desks!

70
00:03:49,179 --> 00:03:50,545
Do not panic!

71
00:03:52,082 --> 00:03:53,282
This is not a drill!

72
00:03:53,284 --> 00:03:56,018
Arms at your side!
Arms at your side!

73
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:57,953
This is a paper company, people!

74
00:03:57,955 --> 00:03:59,888
Step lively!

75
00:03:59,890 --> 00:04:01,423
This whole place is a tinderbox.

76
00:04:01,425 --> 00:04:02,891
It is ready to blow.

77
00:04:05,962 --> 00:04:06,862
This is not a test!

78
00:04:06,864 --> 00:04:07,863
Can you leave?

79
00:04:07,865 --> 00:04:08,830
Oh, you say that every time.

80
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:10,332
Do you wanna die?

81
00:04:10,334 --> 00:04:12,167
Do you wanna die?

82
00:04:12,169 --> 00:04:13,602
Out!

83
00:04:13,604 --> 00:04:15,804
Stanley, have you ever seen
a burn victim?

84
00:04:15,806 --> 00:04:17,172
Move to the exits!

85
00:04:17,174 --> 00:04:18,173
You're safety partners!

86
00:04:18,175 --> 00:04:20,208
Real smoke!
We've got smoke!

87
00:04:20,210 --> 00:04:22,577
Smoke!

88
00:04:25,114 --> 00:04:26,415
God!

89
00:04:36,492 --> 00:04:38,293
Oh, Kelly!
Are you okay?

90
00:04:38,295 --> 00:04:39,294
I gotcha!

91
00:04:39,296 --> 00:04:40,462
Hey!
Get off me!

92
00:04:40,464 --> 00:04:41,897
Get the off of me!

93
00:04:41,899 --> 00:04:42,898
Breathe through your nose.

94
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:45,067
Remove your stockings!
Okay?

95
00:04:45,069 --> 00:04:46,368
They'll melt
right into your flesh!

96
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:48,503
Stay below the smoke line.

97
00:04:49,505 --> 00:04:52,040
Let's go!
Clear out, stat!

98
00:04:52,042 --> 00:04:54,443
Stat means now!

99
00:04:56,279 --> 00:04:58,480
Yes, I was the first one out.

100
00:04:58,482 --> 00:05:01,383
And, yes, I've heard
women and children first.

101
00:05:01,385 --> 00:05:03,885
But we do not employ children.

102
00:05:03,887 --> 00:05:06,855
We are not a sweatshop,
thankfully.

103
00:05:06,857 --> 00:05:12,394
And women are equal
in the workplace by law.

104
00:05:12,396 --> 00:05:14,696
So, I let them out first,

105
00:05:14,698 --> 00:05:16,998
I have a lawsuit on my hands.

106
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,234
Another rule of business...

107
00:05:19,236 --> 00:05:21,403
is being able to adapt
to different situations.

108
00:05:21,405 --> 00:05:23,038
Yeah?

109
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:26,808
Adapt, react, readapt...

110
00:05:26,810 --> 00:05:28,643
Apt.
Right?

111
00:05:28,645 --> 00:05:29,644
That's rule number two.

112
00:05:29,646 --> 00:05:30,679
Okay!

113
00:05:30,681 --> 00:05:31,980
Guys, listen up,
we need a headcount.

114
00:05:31,982 --> 00:05:33,515
Okay, we need a countoff.
Michael's number one.

115
00:05:33,517 --> 00:05:34,549
Where is he?
Where is he?

116
00:05:34,551 --> 00:05:36,385
So what was rule two?

117
00:05:36,387 --> 00:05:38,153
Uh, adapt, react, readapt, apt.

118
00:05:38,155 --> 00:05:39,454
Okay, well, let's...

119
00:05:39,456 --> 00:05:40,856
Let's just kind of take it
a little slower.

120
00:05:40,858 --> 00:05:43,458
Hey, Michael, uh, Ryan needs
a number for the countoff.

121
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:45,761
Okay, uh, well, one is taken.

122
00:05:45,763 --> 00:05:46,762
Uh, okay, two?

123
00:05:46,764 --> 00:05:48,497
No!
Okay... uh, sorry.

124
00:05:48,499 --> 00:05:49,531
Okay, he can have 14.

125
00:05:49,533 --> 00:05:51,099
Margery's not here today.

126
00:05:51,101 --> 00:05:52,267
Well, he needs
a permanent number, all right?

127
00:05:52,269 --> 00:05:53,535
No, I don't.

128
00:05:53,537 --> 00:05:54,603
Oh, you know what else?

129
00:05:54,605 --> 00:05:56,138
I thought of a nickname
for the three of us.

130
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:57,606
Three musketeers.

131
00:05:57,608 --> 00:05:59,808
Um, yeah, okay.

132
00:05:59,810 --> 00:06:01,943
That... no no no no!
I got one, I got one.

133
00:06:01,945 --> 00:06:03,745
The three stooges.

134
00:06:03,747 --> 00:06:05,313
That's funny, too, but if we're
the three musketeers...

135
00:06:05,315 --> 00:06:09,251
I don't wanna be,
like, a guy here, you know?

136
00:06:09,253 --> 00:06:11,887
Like, Stanley is the
crossword puzzle guy.

137
00:06:11,889 --> 00:06:13,922
And Angela has cats.

138
00:06:13,924 --> 00:06:17,626
I don't wanna
have a thing here, you know?

139
00:06:17,628 --> 00:06:21,329
I don't wanna be
the something guy.

140
00:06:21,331 --> 00:06:23,432
Okay, you know what?

141
00:06:23,434 --> 00:06:26,134
I think I'm gonna be
setting the agenda here, okay?

142
00:06:26,136 --> 00:06:27,302
Can everybody gather up, please.

143
00:06:27,304 --> 00:06:28,470
Important announcement.

144
00:06:28,472 --> 00:06:29,571
Very important announcement.

145
00:06:30,606 --> 00:06:31,873
I think this is
a perfect opportunity

146
00:06:31,875 --> 00:06:34,109
for all of us to participate

147
00:06:34,111 --> 00:06:36,711
in some really intense

148
00:06:36,713 --> 00:06:38,346
psychologically revealing
conversations.

149
00:06:38,348 --> 00:06:40,849
So we're gonna be playing
Desert Island...

150
00:06:40,851 --> 00:06:43,285
um, "Who Would You Do?"

151
00:06:43,287 --> 00:06:44,786
And, um...

152
00:06:44,788 --> 00:06:45,754
"Would You Rather?"

153
00:06:45,756 --> 00:06:47,155
"Would You Rather?"

154
00:06:47,157 --> 00:06:48,423
"Would You Rather?"
is our third game.

155
00:06:55,164 --> 00:06:57,032
Yeah!

156
00:06:57,034 --> 00:06:58,834
Hey, what's going on, man?
How are ya?

157
00:06:58,836 --> 00:07:00,268
Long time no see.
Yeah, I know, right?

158
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:03,939
Hey, guys, great response time.

159
00:07:03,941 --> 00:07:06,341
Listen up.
I got some theories.

160
00:07:06,343 --> 00:07:07,509
There's a...

161
00:07:07,511 --> 00:07:10,779
Okay, so, three books
on a desert island.

162
00:07:10,781 --> 00:07:11,813
Angela.

163
00:07:11,815 --> 00:07:12,881
The Bible.

164
00:07:15,117 --> 00:07:19,521
That's one book.
You've got two others.

165
00:07:19,523 --> 00:07:20,489
Purpose Driven Life.

166
00:07:20,491 --> 00:07:22,123
Nice.

167
00:07:22,125 --> 00:07:23,625
Third book.

168
00:07:23,627 --> 00:07:24,726
No.

169
00:07:25,995 --> 00:07:27,496
Okay!
Phyllis.

170
00:07:27,498 --> 00:07:28,763
Um, The Da Vinci Code.

171
00:07:28,765 --> 00:07:30,365
The Da Vinci Code.

172
00:07:30,367 --> 00:07:31,666
I would take The Da Vinci Code.

173
00:07:31,668 --> 00:07:33,535
So I could burn
The Da Vinci code.

174
00:07:33,537 --> 00:07:34,903
Okay, great, that's gonna
keep you warm

175
00:07:34,905 --> 00:07:36,872
for, like, seven seconds.

176
00:07:36,874 --> 00:07:38,940
Question, is there firewood
on the island?

177
00:07:38,942 --> 00:07:40,375
I guess.

178
00:07:40,377 --> 00:07:42,110
Then I would bring an axe.
No books.

179
00:07:42,112 --> 00:07:44,846
No, it has to be a book, Dwight.

180
00:07:44,848 --> 00:07:47,449
Fine.
Physician's Desk Reference.

181
00:07:47,451 --> 00:07:48,550
Nice.
Smart.

182
00:07:48,552 --> 00:07:49,651
Hollowed out.

183
00:07:49,653 --> 00:07:51,553
Inside, waterproof matches,

184
00:07:51,555 --> 00:07:54,356
iodine tablets.

185
00:07:54,358 --> 00:07:56,258
Beet seeds, protein bars,
NASA blanket.

186
00:07:56,260 --> 00:07:58,960
And...

187
00:07:58,962 --> 00:08:00,362
in case I get bored,

188
00:08:00,364 --> 00:08:02,364
Harry Potter
and the Sorcerer's Stone.

189
00:08:02,366 --> 00:08:04,766
No, Harry Potter
and the prisoner of Azkaban.

190
00:08:04,768 --> 00:08:07,536
Question, did my shoes
come off in the plane crash?

191
00:08:07,538 --> 00:08:11,273
Rule number four in business.

192
00:08:11,275 --> 00:08:14,009
Image is everything.
Andre Agassi.

193
00:08:14,011 --> 00:08:16,411
This car is
an investment, right?

194
00:08:16,413 --> 00:08:18,713
If I have to take out a client.

195
00:08:18,715 --> 00:08:21,249
Or I'm seen
around Scranton in it.

196
00:08:23,419 --> 00:08:25,921
I love it.
I love this car.

197
00:08:28,324 --> 00:08:29,558
Do you like it?

198
00:08:32,094 --> 00:08:33,094
Yeah.

199
00:08:33,095 --> 00:08:35,530
Okay, I thought people
read more books.

200
00:08:35,532 --> 00:08:37,399
DVDs. Five movies.

201
00:08:37,401 --> 00:08:38,433
What would you bring
to the island.

202
00:08:38,435 --> 00:08:39,634
Yes, Meredith.

203
00:08:39,636 --> 00:08:42,504
Legends of the Fall,
My Big Fat Greek Wedding,

204
00:08:42,506 --> 00:08:45,006
Legally Blonde,
Bridges of Madison County.

205
00:08:45,008 --> 00:08:46,641
Wow.

206
00:08:46,643 --> 00:08:48,577
Legends of the Fall.
Wow.

207
00:08:48,579 --> 00:08:50,645
Bridges of Madison County,
Legally Blonde.

208
00:08:50,647 --> 00:08:51,713
These movies are just...

209
00:08:51,715 --> 00:08:52,781
Well, I kind of like...

210
00:08:52,783 --> 00:08:54,950
Wait, wait, wait.
Pam, no.

211
00:08:54,952 --> 00:08:57,118
Do you understand?

212
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,521
The game is
desert island movies,

213
00:08:59,523 --> 00:09:00,822
not guilty pleasure movies.

214
00:09:00,824 --> 00:09:02,657
Desert island movies are
the movies you're gonna watch

215
00:09:02,659 --> 00:09:06,595
for the rest of your life!
Forever!

216
00:09:06,597 --> 00:09:07,662
Unforgivable.
I take it back.

217
00:09:07,664 --> 00:09:08,730
Unforgivable.

218
00:09:08,732 --> 00:09:10,332
I take it back!
Good.

219
00:09:10,334 --> 00:09:11,800
And Ghost.

220
00:09:11,802 --> 00:09:14,002
But, uh, just that one scene.

221
00:09:17,239 --> 00:09:18,273
Is this your car, Ryan?

222
00:09:18,275 --> 00:09:20,508
Wow, some pretty big books
back there.

223
00:09:20,510 --> 00:09:21,543
Good shocks.

224
00:09:21,545 --> 00:09:24,512
Hello, Mr. Egghead.
Beep!

225
00:09:24,514 --> 00:09:26,314
Oh, Stanley Kaplan, I know him.

226
00:09:26,316 --> 00:09:28,817
M is for murder.
P is for...

227
00:09:28,819 --> 00:09:30,518
That's actually a test prep book.
What?

228
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:33,121
That's a test prep
for business school.

229
00:09:33,123 --> 00:09:34,189
Oh, thinking about
business school.

230
00:09:34,191 --> 00:09:35,390
I just got in.

231
00:09:35,392 --> 00:09:36,391
I applied.
I go at night.

232
00:09:36,393 --> 00:09:37,559
Really?

233
00:09:37,561 --> 00:09:39,027
So you think you know
a lot about business?

234
00:09:39,029 --> 00:09:40,795
No, not yet.
Just started.

235
00:09:40,797 --> 00:09:42,197
Uh-huh.
Yeah.

236
00:09:42,199 --> 00:09:43,732
Quiz me.

237
00:09:43,734 --> 00:09:45,700
I wouldn't even know...
Oh, come on.

238
00:09:45,702 --> 00:09:48,236
Come on, Egghead.
Let's do it.

239
00:09:48,238 --> 00:09:49,504
Quiz me up.

240
00:09:49,506 --> 00:09:50,739
All right.

241
00:09:50,741 --> 00:09:52,974
Um, why have people been
rethinking

242
00:09:52,976 --> 00:09:56,177
the Microsoft model
in the past few years?

243
00:10:00,583 --> 00:10:01,883
When I was Ryan's age,

244
00:10:01,885 --> 00:10:04,219
I worked
in a fast food restaurant

245
00:10:04,221 --> 00:10:06,354
to save up money for school.

246
00:10:06,356 --> 00:10:10,058
And then I lost it
in a pyramid scheme.

247
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:12,494
But I learned more
about business

248
00:10:12,496 --> 00:10:14,562
right then and there

249
00:10:14,564 --> 00:10:15,897
than business school
would ever teach me.

250
00:10:15,899 --> 00:10:17,632
Or Ryan would ever teach me.

251
00:10:17,634 --> 00:10:20,669
Is it cheaper to sign
a new customer

252
00:10:20,671 --> 00:10:22,570
or to keep an existing customer?

253
00:10:22,572 --> 00:10:23,638
Keep an existing...

254
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:25,040
Shut... it.

255
00:10:25,042 --> 00:10:27,208
Can I just do it please?

256
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:29,077
Uh, it's equal.

257
00:10:29,079 --> 00:10:31,446
It is ten times more expensive
to sign a new customer.

258
00:10:31,448 --> 00:10:33,515
Okay, yes.
It was a trick question.

259
00:10:33,517 --> 00:10:34,749
Yeah, but look.

260
00:10:34,751 --> 00:10:36,051
I mean, he didn't need
business school, okay?

261
00:10:36,053 --> 00:10:37,585
Michael comes from
the school of hard knocks.

262
00:10:37,587 --> 00:10:38,620
Okay, Dwight?
Self-taught.

263
00:10:38,622 --> 00:10:39,621
You didn't even go to college.

264
00:10:39,623 --> 00:10:40,755
You know what?

265
00:10:40,757 --> 00:10:42,123
You don't need
to help me here, okay?

266
00:10:42,125 --> 00:10:43,858
You know, maybe you should
go to business school

267
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:45,326
like Ryan.

268
00:10:45,328 --> 00:10:47,962
Then you'd know what
you're talking about.

269
00:10:47,964 --> 00:10:49,698
You're studying
with the master, huh?

270
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:51,433
You should learn
from him, right?

271
00:10:51,435 --> 00:10:52,734
Right?

272
00:10:52,736 --> 00:10:54,335
Stop.
You know what, Dwight?

273
00:10:54,337 --> 00:10:55,637
You're acting like a dork.

274
00:10:55,639 --> 00:10:57,005
Would you cool it, please?

275
00:10:57,007 --> 00:10:59,074
Okay.

276
00:10:59,076 --> 00:11:01,443
Hey, he's not your
five year old brother, Dwight.

277
00:11:01,445 --> 00:11:04,145
He's a valued member
of this company.

278
00:11:04,147 --> 00:11:05,346
And you know what?

279
00:11:05,348 --> 00:11:08,283
He knows more about business
than you ever will.

280
00:11:10,753 --> 00:11:12,520
Stupid.

281
00:11:12,522 --> 00:11:13,888
I did not go to business school.

282
00:11:13,890 --> 00:11:15,490
You know who else
didn't go to business school?

283
00:11:15,492 --> 00:11:18,093
LeBron James, Tracy McGrady.

284
00:11:18,095 --> 00:11:19,494
Kobe Bryant.

285
00:11:19,496 --> 00:11:21,329
They went right from
high school to the NBA.

286
00:11:21,331 --> 00:11:22,130
So...

287
00:11:25,534 --> 00:11:29,003
So it's not
the same thing at all.

288
00:11:29,005 --> 00:11:30,772
Look at this stuff.

289
00:11:30,774 --> 00:11:33,041
Market fragments,
what is that supposed to be?

290
00:11:33,043 --> 00:11:34,809
It's a way of looking
at consumers as subsets

291
00:11:34,811 --> 00:11:36,511
of a larger client base.

292
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:39,547
You are so smart.

293
00:11:39,549 --> 00:11:41,950
You are so f-ing smart.

294
00:11:41,952 --> 00:11:43,551
You should be teaching me.

295
00:11:45,154 --> 00:11:47,088
Pam, get us back into it.

296
00:11:47,090 --> 00:11:48,723
Five movies, go ahead.

297
00:11:48,725 --> 00:11:50,925
Okay, um, Fargo.

298
00:11:50,927 --> 00:11:53,695
Um, Edward Scissorhands,
Dazed and Confused.

299
00:11:53,697 --> 00:11:54,729
Ooh, definitely in my top five.

300
00:11:54,731 --> 00:11:56,731
Yes, in my top three,
so suck it.

301
00:11:56,733 --> 00:11:59,033
Breakfast Club.

302
00:11:59,035 --> 00:12:01,469
Um, The Princess Bride.

303
00:12:01,471 --> 00:12:02,504
Okay, that's five.

304
00:12:02,506 --> 00:12:04,072
No!
My all time favorite!

305
00:12:04,074 --> 00:12:05,440
Pam, play by the rules.
Play by the rules.

306
00:12:05,442 --> 00:12:07,208
All time favorite.

307
00:12:07,210 --> 00:12:08,443
Dwight!

308
00:12:09,111 --> 00:12:11,212
All time favorite movie.

309
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:16,151
The Crow.

310
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:22,457
I became a salesman
because of people.

311
00:12:22,459 --> 00:12:24,325
I love making friends.

312
00:12:24,327 --> 00:12:27,195
But then I was promoted
to manager

313
00:12:27,197 --> 00:12:30,532
at a very young age.

314
00:12:30,534 --> 00:12:32,233
And I still try
to be a friend first.

315
00:12:32,235 --> 00:12:35,970
But, you know...

316
00:12:35,972 --> 00:12:37,505
When you're very successful,

317
00:12:37,507 --> 00:12:40,341
your co-workers
look at you differently.

318
00:12:45,114 --> 00:12:48,850
Ah, what do you think?

319
00:12:48,852 --> 00:12:51,119
Maybe we should get some air.

320
00:12:51,121 --> 00:12:52,887
No, I'm okay.

321
00:12:54,824 --> 00:12:56,357
I'm really uncomfortable.

322
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:00,195
All right, let's move on.

323
00:13:00,197 --> 00:13:01,896
Let's move on to the main event.

324
00:13:01,898 --> 00:13:03,164
Who would you do?

325
00:13:03,166 --> 00:13:05,066
Present company excluded?

326
00:13:05,068 --> 00:13:06,034
Um, not necessarily.

327
00:13:06,036 --> 00:13:07,735
Pam.
Pam.

328
00:13:07,737 --> 00:13:08,903
Um...

329
00:13:10,472 --> 00:13:11,840
Okay, you know what?

330
00:13:11,842 --> 00:13:13,408
Maybe I'll finish
explaining the rules.

331
00:13:13,410 --> 00:13:15,710
Let me explain it first
and then...

332
00:13:20,383 --> 00:13:21,683
Yeah, so we'll get right...
you know what?

333
00:13:21,685 --> 00:13:23,618
I'll be right back.
Stanley.

334
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:24,752
You're taking over
for me, buddy.

335
00:13:24,754 --> 00:13:25,720
I'll be right back.

336
00:13:25,722 --> 00:13:26,788
Okay.
Um...

337
00:13:30,292 --> 00:13:32,760
Dwight.
Dwight.

338
00:13:34,531 --> 00:13:36,998
Come on, Dwight, use words.

339
00:13:39,035 --> 00:13:40,602
Why didn't I go
to business school?

340
00:13:40,604 --> 00:13:41,736
Who goes to business school?

341
00:13:41,738 --> 00:13:43,037
The temp.
He does?

342
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:44,839
Yeah, it's all him
and Michael talk about anymore.

343
00:13:44,841 --> 00:13:48,710
You know,
I bet Ryan thinks to himself,

344
00:13:48,712 --> 00:13:51,246
"I wish I were a volunteer
Sheriff on the weekend."

345
00:13:51,248 --> 00:13:53,014
He doesn't even know
that I do that.

346
00:13:53,016 --> 00:13:54,849
You should tell him.

347
00:13:54,851 --> 00:13:57,218
Oh, yeah, Pam.
Right.

348
00:13:57,220 --> 00:13:59,654
That's gonna help things,
just talk it out.

349
00:13:59,656 --> 00:14:02,123
I hope the war goes on forever
and Ryan gets drafted.

350
00:14:02,125 --> 00:14:03,157
Dwight.
What?

351
00:14:03,159 --> 00:14:04,392
I'm sorry I said that.

352
00:14:04,394 --> 00:14:05,960
I didn't...

353
00:14:05,962 --> 00:14:08,162
Just part of me meant it.

354
00:14:08,164 --> 00:14:12,200
Besides, he'd end up being
a hero, anyway.

355
00:14:12,202 --> 00:14:13,868
You know what you should do.

356
00:14:13,870 --> 00:14:15,570
You should quit.

357
00:14:16,705 --> 00:14:19,741
And then, that would
stick it to both of them.

358
00:14:19,743 --> 00:14:23,811
No, Jim, I'm not gonna quit.

359
00:14:23,813 --> 00:14:26,347
Then Ryan wins.
Yeah, you're right.

360
00:14:26,349 --> 00:14:28,116
Thanks, you guys.

361
00:14:29,418 --> 00:14:30,952
I just need some alone time.

362
00:14:30,954 --> 00:14:32,820
Okay.

363
00:14:40,296 --> 00:14:41,429
Hey, guys, what's going on?

364
00:14:41,431 --> 00:14:42,397
Nothin'.
Hey!

365
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:43,965
What's up?

366
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:45,199
Can I hang with you guys
for a bit?

367
00:14:45,201 --> 00:14:46,668
The warehouse guys are...

368
00:14:46,670 --> 00:14:47,835
a bunch of jackasses sometimes.

369
00:14:47,837 --> 00:14:49,837
Come on, people,
you know the rules of the game.

370
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:51,339
Oh, hey, hey, game?

371
00:14:51,341 --> 00:14:53,074
What game are we playing here?

372
00:14:53,076 --> 00:14:55,176
Okay, it's called
"Who Would You Do?"

373
00:14:55,178 --> 00:14:56,878
Oh!

374
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:59,013
I play this at home all the time

375
00:14:59,015 --> 00:15:00,848
while I'm falling asleep.

376
00:15:00,850 --> 00:15:04,152
What, uh... where are we?
Where are we here?

377
00:15:04,154 --> 00:15:05,286
Roy?
Roy?

378
00:15:05,288 --> 00:15:07,355
Who would you do, Roy?

379
00:15:07,357 --> 00:15:09,757
Uh...
Oh, I got it!

380
00:15:09,759 --> 00:15:13,594
What's the name of that
tight-ass Christian chick?

381
00:15:13,596 --> 00:15:14,595
The blond?

382
00:15:14,597 --> 00:15:15,964
My name is Angela.

383
00:15:15,966 --> 00:15:18,733
Hey, Angela, Roy.
Nice to meet you.

384
00:15:18,735 --> 00:15:20,535
All right, who's next?
Who's next?

385
00:15:20,537 --> 00:15:22,303
Who's next?
Who's... Jim?

386
00:15:22,305 --> 00:15:24,672
You're next.
Who would you do?

387
00:15:24,674 --> 00:15:29,310
Um, Kevin, hands down.

388
00:15:29,312 --> 00:15:30,678
Yeah.

389
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:32,747
He's really got that
teddy bear thing going on.

390
00:15:32,749 --> 00:15:34,983
Afterwards we could
just watch bowling.

391
00:15:37,186 --> 00:15:41,022
Well, I would definitely
have sex with Ryan.

392
00:15:42,958 --> 00:15:45,259
'Cause he is gonna
own his own business.

393
00:15:45,261 --> 00:15:47,595
You're all gay.

394
00:15:47,597 --> 00:15:49,864
Who's, uh, who's next?
Who we got?

395
00:15:51,134 --> 00:15:52,700
Who?
Hey.

396
00:15:52,702 --> 00:15:54,302
No, I can talk, I can talk.
I can talk.

397
00:15:54,304 --> 00:15:55,837
Well, wish I had my cell phone,

398
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:57,205
but I left it inside, so...

399
00:15:57,207 --> 00:15:58,639
Would that make you happy?

400
00:15:58,641 --> 00:15:59,807
What's that?
If you had your cell phone?

401
00:15:59,809 --> 00:16:00,875
Would it make you happy?
Yeah.

402
00:16:00,877 --> 00:16:02,043
I'm on it.

403
00:16:02,045 --> 00:16:03,111
Dwight.
Hey!

404
00:16:03,113 --> 00:16:04,178
You can't go back in yet!

405
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:05,179
Dwight!

406
00:16:05,181 --> 00:16:06,381
He is an idiot.

407
00:16:06,383 --> 00:16:08,216
The man is an idiot,
ladies and gentlemen.

408
00:16:08,218 --> 00:16:10,885
What if he dies in the fire?

409
00:16:10,887 --> 00:16:13,521
And that's the last thing
you ever said to him?

410
00:16:13,523 --> 00:16:16,557
I didn't say it to him,
I said it about him.

411
00:16:20,229 --> 00:16:22,063
Jim.
Definitely Jim.

412
00:16:22,065 --> 00:16:23,998
Definitely, definitely Jim.

413
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,066
Come on, Pam.
Pam?

414
00:16:25,068 --> 00:16:26,034
Come on.

415
00:16:26,036 --> 00:16:27,668
Um...

416
00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:28,970
Oscar's kind of cute.

417
00:16:28,972 --> 00:16:30,938
Yeah, I like Oscar.

418
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:33,074
Ooh, Toby.

419
00:16:33,076 --> 00:16:36,878
How long does it take
to find a cell phone?

420
00:16:39,081 --> 00:16:42,016
Um, is there anybody else?

421
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:47,688
Hey, where are you?
Oh, good.

422
00:16:47,690 --> 00:16:49,123
Yeah, we're just here.

423
00:16:49,125 --> 00:16:50,591
We're playing desert island.

424
00:16:50,593 --> 00:16:52,827
That's where you pick
your five favorite DVDs.

425
00:16:52,829 --> 00:16:56,164
Seriously,
where the hell is Dwight?

426
00:16:57,499 --> 00:16:59,400
I don't know.

427
00:16:59,402 --> 00:17:03,004
Hey, call my cell phone.

428
00:17:03,006 --> 00:17:04,806
It'll make it easier
for him to find.

429
00:17:06,742 --> 00:17:08,142
What's your number?

430
00:17:08,144 --> 00:17:09,544
I gave it to you in the car.

431
00:17:09,546 --> 00:17:11,512
Um...

432
00:17:11,514 --> 00:17:14,248
I saw you program it in.

433
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:16,350
You gotta... you gotta
give it to me again.

434
00:17:16,352 --> 00:17:17,985
All right.

435
00:17:21,123 --> 00:17:22,857
Now, I have it.

436
00:17:34,036 --> 00:17:37,772
Um, I better tell somebody.

437
00:17:37,774 --> 00:17:39,073
Excuse me, sir?

438
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:41,375
Dwight!

439
00:17:41,377 --> 00:17:42,910
Dwight!

440
00:17:42,912 --> 00:17:44,946
God, man,
why did you go in there?

441
00:17:44,948 --> 00:17:47,782
Everybody was scared
out of their wits, man.

442
00:17:47,784 --> 00:17:49,684
Everyone, okay.
Uh...

443
00:17:49,686 --> 00:17:51,619
I have an announcement.

444
00:17:51,621 --> 00:17:54,355
Apparently, in business school,

445
00:17:54,357 --> 00:17:56,124
they don't teach you
how to operate

446
00:17:56,126 --> 00:17:58,025
a toaster oven.

447
00:17:58,027 --> 00:18:00,461
Because some smart, sexy temp

448
00:18:00,463 --> 00:18:02,964
left his cheese pita on oven

449
00:18:02,966 --> 00:18:05,833
instead of timing it
for the toaster thing!

450
00:18:07,904 --> 00:18:10,671
Oh, wow!
Okay.

451
00:18:10,673 --> 00:18:13,441
Well, I guess they don't teach
how to operate

452
00:18:13,443 --> 00:18:15,009
a toaster oven
in business school...

453
00:18:15,011 --> 00:18:16,544
That's exactly what I said!

454
00:18:16,546 --> 00:18:18,246
Hey, did you miss that day,
there, Ryan?

455
00:18:18,248 --> 00:18:19,313
Were you absent?

456
00:18:19,315 --> 00:18:20,982
Toaster oven 101?

457
00:18:20,984 --> 00:18:22,250
I am so sorry.

458
00:18:22,252 --> 00:18:25,353
Oh, man.

459
00:18:25,355 --> 00:18:27,655
Hey, I know
what'll impress everybody.

460
00:18:27,657 --> 00:18:30,057
I'll start a fire.

461
00:18:30,059 --> 00:18:31,092
Oh, man.

462
00:18:31,094 --> 00:18:33,761
Bad idea.
Bad idea jeans.

463
00:18:33,763 --> 00:18:35,863
I have a song...
attention everyone...

464
00:18:35,865 --> 00:18:37,365
that I wanna sing.

465
00:18:37,367 --> 00:18:39,066
That I wrote especially
for this occasion

466
00:18:39,068 --> 00:18:40,568
when I was up there
among the flames.

467
00:18:40,570 --> 00:18:42,203
Ready?

468
00:18:54,150 --> 00:18:59,554
I can't believe
I started the fire.

469
00:19:07,163 --> 00:19:08,262
I'm so sorry.

470
00:19:10,967 --> 00:19:12,133
Eat it!
He has to eat it!

471
00:19:12,135 --> 00:19:13,201
Hey.
How are you?

472
00:19:13,203 --> 00:19:14,802
Good, how are you?
I'm good.

473
00:19:14,804 --> 00:19:16,237
It's good to see you.
Good to see you too.

474
00:19:16,239 --> 00:19:17,638
I'm hungry.
Yeah, I am too.

475
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:20,541
Oh, I have been thinking
the whole way over,

476
00:19:20,543 --> 00:19:22,743
and I have my answers.
What answers?

477
00:19:22,745 --> 00:19:24,178
Uh, for the desert island.

478
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:25,513
Oh, right!
Right right right!

479
00:19:25,515 --> 00:19:26,747
Come on, come on.

480
00:19:26,749 --> 00:19:27,782
Ladies and gentlemen,
gather 'round.

481
00:19:27,784 --> 00:19:29,183
We have one more participant.

482
00:19:29,185 --> 00:19:31,018
Come on, be polite.
Be polite.

483
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:34,188
Desert island, five movies, go.

484
00:19:34,190 --> 00:19:38,626
Okay, um, first, Legally Blonde.

485
00:19:40,830 --> 00:19:45,299
I forgot what
a super nice girl Katie is.

486
00:19:45,301 --> 00:19:46,934
And, just... good for Jim.

487
00:19:46,936 --> 00:19:49,003
They are so cute together.

488
00:19:49,005 --> 00:19:52,840
And, um, what an adorable car!

489
00:19:52,842 --> 00:19:55,276
Okay!

490
00:19:55,278 --> 00:19:56,377
I think the game's over.

491
00:19:56,379 --> 00:19:57,378
People are, like, leaving.

492
00:19:57,380 --> 00:19:58,846
There was
a bigger crowd last time.

493
00:19:58,848 --> 00:19:59,914
Do you wanna just go to lunch?

494
00:19:59,916 --> 00:20:01,115
Okay, all right.
Yeah?

495
00:20:01,117 --> 00:20:02,116
You wanna drive?
Sure.

496
00:20:02,118 --> 00:20:03,718
All right.

497
00:20:10,759 --> 00:20:13,494
They are so cute.

498
00:20:13,496 --> 00:20:14,895
I'm really sorry, Dwight.

499
00:20:14,897 --> 00:20:16,564
Answer me this, though.
What?

500
00:20:16,566 --> 00:20:19,233
Was it worth it?
Was it worth it, temp?

501
00:20:19,235 --> 00:20:20,468
No.
Really?

502
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:21,636
I'm really sorry, Dwight.

503
00:20:21,638 --> 00:20:24,105
The fire guy!
The fire guy!

504
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:34,282
Okay, rule five, safety first,

505
00:20:34,284 --> 00:20:37,718
I.e. don't burn the
building down, okay?

506
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:38,819
That should be
a no-brainer.

507
00:20:38,821 --> 00:20:40,955
Oh, look...

508
00:20:40,957 --> 00:20:44,358
Ryan is book smart.

509
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:46,961
And I am street smart.

510
00:20:46,963 --> 00:20:48,095
And book smart.

511
00:20:48,097 --> 00:20:52,400
I'll give you
the rest of the ten tomorrow.
