1
00:00:04,693 --> 00:00:06,227
Hey, can you do me a favor?

2
00:00:06,228 --> 00:00:09,163
Can we try to avoid talking
to our friends tonight

3
00:00:09,165 --> 00:00:10,496
about our wedding plans?

4
00:00:10,499 --> 00:00:12,298
I'll do you one better.

5
00:00:12,301 --> 00:00:14,234
I'll avoid talking
to our friends entirely

6
00:00:14,236 --> 00:00:16,604
and play on my phone.

7
00:00:16,605 --> 00:00:19,373
It's just, I haven't picked
a maid of honor yet,

8
00:00:19,374 --> 00:00:22,242
and I'm having trouble deciding
between Penny and Bernadette.

9
00:00:22,245 --> 00:00:24,010
Ah, understandable.

10
00:00:24,013 --> 00:00:25,312
They are quite similar—

11
00:00:25,313 --> 00:00:30,216
both blonde former waitresses
who married beneath them.

12
00:00:30,219 --> 00:00:31,986
Penny is my best friend,

13
00:00:31,987 --> 00:00:33,754
but I was Bernadette's
maid of honor,

14
00:00:33,755 --> 00:00:35,422
and I think
she kind of expects it.

15
00:00:35,424 --> 00:00:37,625
So if anyone brings
it up tonight,

16
00:00:37,626 --> 00:00:39,793
just maybe you can help
me change the subject.

17
00:00:39,794 --> 00:00:41,160
How about this?

18
00:00:41,163 --> 00:00:43,163
I dominate
the conversation so hard,

19
00:00:43,165 --> 00:00:46,266
no one has a chance
to get a word in edgewise.

20
00:00:47,436 --> 00:00:49,303
I don't know.

21
00:00:49,305 --> 00:00:51,205
They might see that coming.

22
00:00:51,206 --> 00:00:52,973
What if we have
a code word?

23
00:00:52,974 --> 00:00:55,742
Ooh, now you're speaking
my catamaran.

24
00:00:57,178 --> 00:00:58,913
That's my code word
for “language.”

25
00:00:58,915 --> 00:01:01,348
Okay, fine, catamaran.

26
00:01:01,349 --> 00:01:02,715
That's our code word.

27
00:01:02,717 --> 00:01:04,852
No, that's my code word.
Get your own.

28
00:01:04,854 --> 00:01:08,589
Okay. Uh, pretzels.

29
00:01:08,590 --> 00:01:11,491
You hear me say pretzels,
you change the subject.

30
00:01:11,494 --> 00:01:15,028
Rhinos are my least favorite
animals at the zoo.

31
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:16,763
What?

32
00:01:16,765 --> 00:01:19,465
Oh, I'm sorry.
I thought we started.

33
00:01:21,336 --> 00:01:25,372
Hey, just-just hold the gate
still while I screw it in.

34
00:01:25,373 --> 00:01:26,640
You know, I don't
know how I feel

35
00:01:26,641 --> 00:01:28,342
about all this
baby-proofing.

36
00:01:28,343 --> 00:01:30,577
If Halley can't teach herself
to walk down the stairs,

37
00:01:30,578 --> 00:01:32,245
then maybe that's nature's way
of saying

38
00:01:32,247 --> 00:01:34,848
the Wolowitz line ends here.

39
00:01:35,717 --> 00:01:37,016
That's funny.
I always thought

40
00:01:37,019 --> 00:01:38,551
Howard was nature's
way of saying

41
00:01:38,554 --> 00:01:40,687
the Wolowitz
line ends here.

42
00:01:41,890 --> 00:01:45,893
Me, too, but life does
find a way!

43
00:01:45,894 --> 00:01:48,962
Hey, Halley can't reach
the liquor cabinet.

44
00:01:48,965 --> 00:01:50,129
Why did you baby-proof it?

45
00:01:50,132 --> 00:01:52,800
How did you know we did?

46
00:01:54,036 --> 00:01:56,235
Fair point.

47
00:01:57,539 --> 00:01:59,806
LEONARD: Bernadette
still going stir-crazy?

48
00:01:59,809 --> 00:02:01,208
Oh, a little.

49
00:02:01,209 --> 00:02:03,310
Two months of bed rest—
it's kind of rough.

50
00:02:03,312 --> 00:02:05,479
Really? That sounds great.
How do I get that?

51
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:09,316
You'd either have to break your
hip or let Howard knock you up.

52
00:02:10,585 --> 00:02:13,419
Now, either way, you'll get
flowers the next morning.

53
00:02:13,422 --> 00:02:16,357
She's actually been
keeping herself busy

54
00:02:16,359 --> 00:02:18,459
doing wedding research for you.

55
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:22,295
Oh, she-she doesn't
have to do that.

56
00:02:22,298 --> 00:02:24,998
She wants to. After all,
you were her maid of honor.

57
00:02:27,536 --> 00:02:30,270
Sheldon, tell your funny story
about pretzels.

58
00:02:31,941 --> 00:02:33,539
Oh, right. Yeah, oh, yeah.

59
00:02:33,542 --> 00:02:35,174
Did you know
that we've been thinking

60
00:02:35,176 --> 00:02:37,411
of having pretzels
at our wedding? Hmm?

61
00:02:37,412 --> 00:02:39,613
No, no. No, no, no,
no, no. I'm sorry.

62
00:02:39,614 --> 00:02:41,614
No, rhinos. We're having
rhinos at our wedding.

63
00:02:41,616 --> 00:02:44,184
No! (stammers)
I got to go.

64
00:02:48,623 --> 00:02:50,123
I'm gonna need some help.

65
00:02:50,126 --> 00:02:52,191

@elder_man

76
00:03:18,948 --> 00:03:21,716
Sheldon, what am I gonna do
about my maid of honor?

77
00:03:21,717 --> 00:03:24,418
I mean, Bernadette gave me
all these bridal magazines.

78
00:03:24,419 --> 00:03:27,153
She even folded down the pages
with the good dresses.

79
00:03:27,156 --> 00:03:28,455
Hmm. Hmm.

80
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:29,857
I get it.

81
00:03:29,859 --> 00:03:32,592
You know, Leonard once borrowed
my Edmund Scientific catalogue

82
00:03:32,595 --> 00:03:34,095
and dog-eared some pages.

83
00:03:34,097 --> 00:03:36,364
Never got 'em straight again.

84
00:03:37,432 --> 00:03:39,599
Well, that is
exactly the same thing.

85
00:03:39,602 --> 00:03:42,803
You really
understand my dilemma.

86
00:03:42,805 --> 00:03:45,772
Actually, I do.
My mother

87
00:03:45,775 --> 00:03:48,441
is pushing for my brother,
Georgie, to be my best man,

88
00:03:48,443 --> 00:03:50,144
and I hate
to disappoint her again.

89
00:03:50,145 --> 00:03:52,947
I already rejected her savior
and her Linkedln invitation.

90
00:03:54,917 --> 00:03:56,751
How are we gonna
make these decisions

91
00:03:56,753 --> 00:03:58,953
without anybody getting upset?

92
00:03:58,955 --> 00:04:03,223
Well, what if we take emotion
out of the process,

93
00:04:03,226 --> 00:04:05,525
and base it
on empirical metrics?

94
00:04:05,527 --> 00:04:08,162
Then we aren't really
making the decision;

95
00:04:08,163 --> 00:04:09,729
the data is.

96
00:04:09,732 --> 00:04:11,732
So we can hurt our
friends' feelings

97
00:04:11,734 --> 00:04:14,335
without taking any
responsibility?

98
00:04:16,972 --> 00:04:19,172
Me likey.

99
00:04:20,943 --> 00:04:22,977
But how do we apply
quantitative metrics

100
00:04:22,979 --> 00:04:25,645
to something as subjective
as choosing a wedding party?

101
00:04:25,647 --> 00:04:28,082
That decision only
seems subjective.

102
00:04:28,083 --> 00:04:29,516
In reality,

103
00:04:29,518 --> 00:04:32,352
people in a wedding party
perform very specific functions,

104
00:04:32,354 --> 00:04:34,220
and some will perform those
better than others.

105
00:04:34,222 --> 00:04:36,263
If I may use
a superhero analogy...

106
00:04:36,287 --> 00:04:37,391
You may not.

107
00:04:37,393 --> 00:04:39,092
Okay, I'll use real people.

108
00:04:39,095 --> 00:04:42,595
Um, if a certain
dog-like loyalty is useful,

109
00:04:42,597 --> 00:04:44,864
then it's Leonard, hmm?

110
00:04:44,866 --> 00:04:46,366
If, uh, having a PEZ dispenser

111
00:04:46,369 --> 00:04:49,236
filled with TUMS is
an advantage, Wolowitz, yeah.

112
00:04:49,237 --> 00:04:52,138
If a best man
with fake testicles hanging

113
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:53,441
from his truck is important,

114
00:04:53,443 --> 00:04:55,842
well, then, my brother's
back in the running.

115
00:04:57,446 --> 00:04:59,345
Okay, I see your point.

116
00:04:59,347 --> 00:05:01,681
So we break down
each of the roles

117
00:05:01,684 --> 00:05:03,316
into their component parts,

118
00:05:03,318 --> 00:05:06,152
and then design
specialized tests for each.

119
00:05:06,155 --> 00:05:09,222
Exactly. Boy, if I had known
getting married was going to

120
00:05:09,224 --> 00:05:12,493
involve so much science,
I'd have proposed years ago.

121
00:05:14,597 --> 00:05:16,797
So Leonard,
tell everyone your news.

122
00:05:16,799 --> 00:05:19,232
Oh, oh, I'm
starting a book.

123
00:05:19,234 --> 00:05:21,469
That would be big news
from Penny,

124
00:05:21,470 --> 00:05:24,871
but you've read a book before.

125
00:05:24,873 --> 00:05:27,874
He means he's writing a book.

126
00:05:27,876 --> 00:05:30,878
I do. It's something I've been
thinking about for a long time.

127
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,979
Yeah. It's about
a brilliant physicist

128
00:05:32,982 --> 00:05:35,349
who solves crimes
using science.

129
00:05:35,351 --> 00:05:36,417
Oh, Leonard...

130
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:38,218
It's not about you.

131
00:05:40,088 --> 00:05:42,323
He probably has to say
that for legal reasons.

132
00:05:42,325 --> 00:05:44,458
WOLOWITZ:
Uh-oh.

133
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:47,494
They gave us plain rice
instead of fried rice.

134
00:05:47,496 --> 00:05:49,063
Well, no fair!

135
00:05:49,064 --> 00:05:50,330
I SoulCycled this morning.

136
00:05:50,333 --> 00:05:52,833
I'm entitled
to a pile of fat rice.

137
00:05:52,835 --> 00:05:58,205
Well, I would say that this
constitutes a catering crisis.

138
00:05:58,207 --> 00:06:02,075
I agree. Who's gonna
step up and handle it?

139
00:06:06,648 --> 00:06:08,414
Doesn't matter.
This is fine.

140
00:06:08,417 --> 00:06:10,284
(mouths)

141
00:06:12,722 --> 00:06:13,854
Penny?

142
00:06:13,856 --> 00:06:16,623
(mouth full):
What?

143
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:19,292
You know what?
I'll take care of it.

144
00:06:19,294 --> 00:06:22,563
(speaks Mandarin)

145
00:06:36,412 --> 00:06:38,244
Done.

146
00:06:38,246 --> 00:06:40,246
You didn't make him
feel bad, did you?

147
00:06:40,248 --> 00:06:42,082
Actually, he
was laughing.

148
00:06:42,083 --> 00:06:43,883
(laughs)

149
00:06:43,885 --> 00:06:46,753
I'm really impressed
at how you handled that, Howard.

150
00:06:46,756 --> 00:06:48,054
WOLOWITZ:
Please.

151
00:06:48,056 --> 00:06:49,789
I've been sending food
back my entire life.

152
00:06:49,792 --> 00:06:51,424
One of my first
full sentences was,

153
00:06:51,426 --> 00:06:53,861
“I had breast milk
for breakfast"

154
00:06:56,799 --> 00:06:58,732
Excuse me,
b-before we start eating,

155
00:06:58,734 --> 00:07:00,568
I-I would like
to make a toast.

156
00:07:00,569 --> 00:07:02,001
Oh, nice.
Oh, nice.

157
00:07:02,003 --> 00:07:03,270
If only I could
think of one.

158
00:07:03,272 --> 00:07:05,506
Someone else go.

159
00:07:07,809 --> 00:07:09,876
Hey. Here's the sewing kit
you asked for.

160
00:07:09,878 --> 00:07:11,477
Ooh! A minute, 19.

161
00:07:11,479 --> 00:07:13,446
Quick.

162
00:07:14,249 --> 00:07:16,249
You were timing me?

163
00:07:16,251 --> 00:07:19,953
Yes. I am going through
a bit of a timing phase.

164
00:07:19,955 --> 00:07:21,487
How long will it last?

165
00:07:21,489 --> 00:07:23,590
We'll find out.

166
00:07:24,359 --> 00:07:26,059
What did you need the kit for?

167
00:07:27,597 --> 00:07:28,828
Oh, um...

168
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:32,099
Sh-Sheldon was squatting down
to pick up a fork

169
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:33,667
and he ripped his pants.

170
00:07:33,669 --> 00:07:37,871
Oh, someone's gonna
be sore tomorrow.

171
00:07:39,308 --> 00:07:41,407
(door closes)
Oh, quick thinking.

172
00:07:41,410 --> 00:07:42,977
But for future lies,

173
00:07:42,979 --> 00:07:44,912
this is as far
as I can squat.

174
00:07:47,415 --> 00:07:49,415
Penny gets 20 points
for the sewing kit.

175
00:07:49,417 --> 00:07:51,085
Yeah, minus five,

176
00:07:51,087 --> 00:07:53,253
because this is mine.

177
00:07:54,556 --> 00:07:56,823
Well, she's still pulling
a commanding lead.

178
00:07:56,825 --> 00:07:59,292
Did Bernadette even try
to send us a sewing kit?

179
00:07:59,294 --> 00:08:01,761
She did.
Amazon, standard shipping,

180
00:08:01,763 --> 00:08:03,897
not even Prime.
(gasps)

181
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,332
We could've done
that ourselves.

182
00:08:05,333 --> 00:08:07,934
(chuckles)
That's what she said.

183
00:08:08,737 --> 00:08:10,703
Maybe we're being
old-fashioned,

184
00:08:10,705 --> 00:08:12,573
defining these
roles by gender.

185
00:08:12,575 --> 00:08:15,275
You know, historically,
the best man's role

186
00:08:15,277 --> 00:08:17,143
was to defend the bride
and groom in combat.

187
00:08:17,145 --> 00:08:18,279
I mean, if that's not Penny,

188
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:20,780
I don't know what
we're doing here.

189
00:08:20,782 --> 00:08:22,683
I see your point.

190
00:08:22,684 --> 00:08:26,753
Okay, we are officially open
to a best woman

191
00:08:26,756 --> 00:08:29,323
and a gentleman of honor.

192
00:08:29,325 --> 00:08:30,758
Oh, those names are terrible.

193
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,760
One point off for you.

194
00:08:33,529 --> 00:08:35,562
What am I being
tested for?

195
00:08:35,563 --> 00:08:37,597
Oh, it's not important.
But if you don't pass,

196
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,299
none of this matters.

197
00:08:40,836 --> 00:08:42,770
Okay, what's the next test?

198
00:08:42,771 --> 00:08:44,170
Loyalty.

199
00:08:44,173 --> 00:08:46,439
We need to choose
someone who has our backs,

200
00:08:46,442 --> 00:08:49,677
someone who will keep our
secrets even from each other.

201
00:08:49,679 --> 00:08:52,011
Well, I don't have any secrets
from you.

202
00:08:52,014 --> 00:08:53,646
Do you have secrets from me?

203
00:08:53,649 --> 00:08:55,783
Yes.

204
00:08:56,718 --> 00:08:58,485
Oh, that has been weighing
on me for years.

205
00:08:58,486 --> 00:08:59,786
Come here.

206
00:09:02,991 --> 00:09:06,894
Would you call yourself
a loyal and trustworthy friend?

207
00:09:06,895 --> 00:09:09,195
Yeah, I like to think so.
Great.

208
00:09:09,198 --> 00:09:11,497
Because I need to tell you
something about Howard,

209
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:13,634
but you can't tell him
that I told you.

210
00:09:13,635 --> 00:09:15,336
Nope. Don't want to hear it.

211
00:09:15,337 --> 00:09:17,103
Do not like to engage in gossip.

212
00:09:17,106 --> 00:09:20,841
Okay. I respect
your integrity.

213
00:09:22,510 --> 00:09:23,876
Is it about
his special underwear?

214
00:09:23,879 --> 00:09:26,280
Because I already know.
And that's all I'll say.

215
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:31,084
Fine, it has
a charcoal filter in it.

216
00:09:32,554 --> 00:09:35,789
It's really sweet of you
to come by and keep me company.

217
00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:37,824
Agreed. Uh...

218
00:09:39,127 --> 00:09:42,696
So, listen,
I have a secret

219
00:09:42,698 --> 00:09:44,732
that I need to
tell someone.

220
00:09:44,733 --> 00:09:47,134
But you can
never say a word.

221
00:09:47,135 --> 00:09:48,501
Not even to Howard.

222
00:09:48,504 --> 00:09:50,670
I'm your girl. Lay it on me.

223
00:09:50,673 --> 00:09:52,206
Really?

224
00:09:52,208 --> 00:09:54,875
You keep things
from your husband?

225
00:09:54,876 --> 00:09:56,142
No, I tell him everything.

226
00:09:56,145 --> 00:09:58,212
Don't be a child.

227
00:09:59,314 --> 00:10:02,716
Okay. Here it is.

228
00:10:02,717 --> 00:10:04,751
I can control
the thermostat

229
00:10:04,754 --> 00:10:07,221
in Leonard's apartment
with my phone.

230
00:10:07,222 --> 00:10:10,323
And when he makes me mad,

231
00:10:10,326 --> 00:10:13,760
I turn it up, slightly.

232
00:10:16,031 --> 00:10:18,097
Oh, hey. I didn't
know you were here.

233
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:19,967
What are you two
talking about?

234
00:10:21,770 --> 00:10:24,871
Literally, nothing interesting.

235
00:10:26,275 --> 00:10:28,541
Oh, you're good.

236
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:34,982
Okay, getting to
the ceremony on time.

237
00:10:34,983 --> 00:10:37,150
Leonard, quick.
I need you to get me

238
00:10:37,153 --> 00:10:38,818
to Arcadia
within the hour.

239
00:10:38,821 --> 00:10:40,154
The train store's
having a sale.

240
00:10:40,155 --> 00:10:41,722
Why can't Amy drive you?

241
00:10:41,723 --> 00:10:45,692
Because of the tradition
that I cannot see Amy

242
00:10:45,693 --> 00:10:48,261
on the day of
the train store sale.

243
00:10:48,264 --> 00:10:51,664
Please, please see a doctor.

244
00:10:52,867 --> 00:10:55,302
Next test.
Just wait one second.

245
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:03,110
Is it getting
hot in here?

246
00:11:03,111 --> 00:11:05,679
(laughs)

247
00:11:07,583 --> 00:11:09,415
I'm sorry.
Where were we?

248
00:11:09,418 --> 00:11:12,453
How well do our friends know us?

249
00:11:13,655 --> 00:11:15,923
So I was talking
to my favorite aunt...

250
00:11:15,924 --> 00:11:18,092
Aunt Doe, right?

251
00:11:18,093 --> 00:11:19,626
Exactly.

252
00:11:19,627 --> 00:11:22,161
Did she ever figure out what
that thing on her knee was?

253
00:11:22,164 --> 00:11:24,865
Turns out it was
a chocolate chip.

254
00:11:24,866 --> 00:11:28,535
Hmm. Makes sense,
she does like to bake.

255
00:11:28,536 --> 00:11:32,939
Yes, she does. Damn,
you are a thoroughbred.

256
00:11:32,942 --> 00:11:36,242
You know, dealing
with cold feet

257
00:11:36,245 --> 00:11:40,447
is an important part of being
both best man and maid of honor.

258
00:11:40,448 --> 00:11:42,683
Maybe we should test
for that ability.

259
00:11:42,684 --> 00:11:46,319
You really think you
might get cold feet?

260
00:11:46,322 --> 00:11:49,823
Actually, I was
talking about you.

261
00:11:49,824 --> 00:11:52,492
Amy...

262
00:11:52,495 --> 00:11:54,995
if there's one thing in
this world I'm sure of,

263
00:11:54,996 --> 00:11:56,730
you are right
to be worried.

264
00:11:59,535 --> 00:12:00,900
Good night.

265
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:05,872
Howard.

266
00:12:05,875 --> 00:12:09,910
I've had my eye on this
limited edition Swamp Thing,

267
00:12:09,911 --> 00:12:11,278
but now that I'm
about to buy it,

268
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:13,813
I'm having second thoughts.
What do you think?

269
00:12:13,815 --> 00:12:17,150
I don't know, Sheldon,
it's pretty expensive.

270
00:12:17,153 --> 00:12:20,554
Yes, but what if it will
make me happy, you know,

271
00:12:20,555 --> 00:12:24,357
waking up and seeing it every
morning for the rest of my life?

272
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:28,028
Really, a walking
clump of swamp grass?

273
00:12:28,030 --> 00:12:31,198
Yeah, well, Bernadette's
no prize either!

274
00:12:33,736 --> 00:12:36,035
Hey, what you doing?
Oh.

275
00:12:36,038 --> 00:12:38,938
Sheldon gave me a brain teaser.
It's kind of fun.

276
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:40,607
It's about a group
of people at dinner,

277
00:12:40,608 --> 00:12:43,577
and you have to figure out where
they can sit without fighting.

278
00:12:44,612 --> 00:12:46,480
Oh, yeah, is this
the one where Mr. Green

279
00:12:46,482 --> 00:12:48,549
can't sit next to
anyone eating meat,

280
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:49,716
and Uncle Light Blue

281
00:12:49,717 --> 00:12:52,318
won't sit next to any
of the darker colors?

282
00:12:53,822 --> 00:12:56,456
Yeah, did Sheldon
send it to you?

283
00:12:56,458 --> 00:12:57,924
Amy did. I solved it already.

284
00:12:57,927 --> 00:12:59,025
Really?
Yeah.

285
00:12:59,028 --> 00:13:00,961
Same way I solved
my jury duty summons,

286
00:13:00,962 --> 00:13:02,161
I threw it away.

287
00:13:02,164 --> 00:13:04,030
KOOTHRAPPALI:
No, no, no, no, no.

288
00:13:04,033 --> 00:13:07,300
Uh, Aunt Orange can't
sit next to the bar

289
00:13:07,303 --> 00:13:08,434
without Ms. Pink saying,

290
00:13:08,437 --> 00:13:11,204
“Jesus thinks you've
had enough whiskey.”

291
00:13:12,574 --> 00:13:15,641
Did Sheldon and Amy give
you guys that puzzle, too?

292
00:13:15,644 --> 00:13:19,446
Yeah. Is it just me or
have they been acting strange?

293
00:13:19,448 --> 00:13:21,247
I don't think they're acting.

294
00:13:23,419 --> 00:13:24,617
Yeah, the other day,
Sheldon made me

295
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:25,953
take him to the train store.

296
00:13:25,954 --> 00:13:27,453
We didn't go inside.
He just said,

297
00:13:27,456 --> 00:13:30,057
“Nicely done,”
and then we went home.

298
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:32,592
Yeah, and Amy gave me
this plastic ring

299
00:13:32,594 --> 00:13:34,260
and told me to hold on to it.

300
00:13:34,262 --> 00:13:35,228
I got one, too.

301
00:13:35,231 --> 00:13:36,129
Yeah, same.

302
00:13:36,131 --> 00:13:37,496
Yeah, me, too.

303
00:13:37,498 --> 00:13:39,399
But-but Cinnamon ate it.

304
00:13:41,002 --> 00:13:43,203
I-I'll get it
back tomorrow.

305
00:13:47,575 --> 00:13:49,543
I have to say, this
is going pretty well.

306
00:13:49,544 --> 00:13:50,677
It is.

307
00:13:50,679 --> 00:13:54,280
I-If experimenting on humans
is morally wrong,

308
00:13:54,283 --> 00:13:56,882
then I don't want
to be morally right.

309
00:13:56,885 --> 00:13:58,184
(door opens)

310
00:13:58,187 --> 00:13:59,385
Hey, are you testing us

311
00:13:59,387 --> 00:14:01,255
to see who gets
to be in your wedding?

312
00:14:01,256 --> 00:14:02,823
Yes.
No.

313
00:14:04,492 --> 00:14:06,326
Wha— they're rating us.

314
00:14:06,328 --> 00:14:08,060
And I'm in last?

315
00:14:08,063 --> 00:14:11,131
Don't panic,
there's still time.

316
00:14:11,132 --> 00:14:13,799
Look, it's a marathon,
not a sprint.

317
00:14:13,802 --> 00:14:16,035
You know what,
this is so insulting.

318
00:14:16,038 --> 00:14:18,105
I-I don't even want to be
your stupid best man.

319
00:14:18,107 --> 00:14:19,472
Yeah.
Me neither.

320
00:14:19,475 --> 00:14:20,741
W-W-Wait, wait.

321
00:14:20,742 --> 00:14:23,242
Just out of curiosity,
which one of you figured it out?

322
00:14:23,245 --> 00:14:24,910
I did.

323
00:14:26,081 --> 00:14:28,214
Impressive.

324
00:14:33,179 --> 00:14:34,439
Hello, Stuart.

325
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:35,506
Oh, hey, Sheldon.

326
00:14:35,509 --> 00:14:38,242
Can I interest you
in a cappuccino?

327
00:14:38,245 --> 00:14:40,444
When did you start
selling those?

328
00:14:40,447 --> 00:14:43,313
Oh, someone left it here,
but it's still warm.

329
00:14:44,384 --> 00:14:47,552
Want to say four bucks?

330
00:14:47,554 --> 00:14:49,453
No, thank you.

331
00:14:49,456 --> 00:14:51,423
Oh. Everything okay?

332
00:14:51,424 --> 00:14:53,458
Well...

333
00:14:53,459 --> 00:14:55,660
I secretly experimented
on my friends,

334
00:14:55,661 --> 00:14:58,496
and now none of them
want to be my best man.

335
00:14:58,497 --> 00:15:01,632
So, you know,
normal wedding drama.

336
00:15:01,635 --> 00:15:04,169
Sorry.

337
00:15:04,170 --> 00:15:06,404
Probably have to use
my stupid brother.

338
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:08,606
So get ready for a wedding toast
delivered by his armpit.

339
00:15:08,607 --> 00:15:11,842
Well, if you really don't
want to use your brother,

340
00:15:11,844 --> 00:15:13,310
I'd be your best man.

341
00:15:13,313 --> 00:15:15,380
Really?

342
00:15:15,381 --> 00:15:18,315
Yeah, we're friends.

343
00:15:18,318 --> 00:15:19,684
Plus, it'd be nice.

344
00:15:19,685 --> 00:15:23,987
Never really been called
the best before.

345
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:26,757
Or a man, for that matter.

346
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:30,094
Okay, well, uh,
thank you, Stuart.

347
00:15:30,097 --> 00:15:31,496
That's a very generous offer.

348
00:15:31,497 --> 00:15:33,331
My pleasure.

349
00:15:33,333 --> 00:15:34,399
I-I understand

350
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:37,535
the best man usually
receives a present.

351
00:15:37,536 --> 00:15:40,371
That's true.

352
00:15:41,308 --> 00:15:44,108
Can never have
too much Claritin.

353
00:15:48,081 --> 00:15:51,482
You're still working on
Sheldon's dumb brain teaser?

354
00:15:51,485 --> 00:15:54,651
Oh, my God, Dr. Purple's
a woman! Of course!

355
00:15:55,421 --> 00:15:57,789
Oh, that feels so good.

356
00:15:58,692 --> 00:16:00,190
Hello.

357
00:16:00,193 --> 00:16:03,394
I believe I owe the
three of you an apology.

358
00:16:03,395 --> 00:16:06,396
No argument here.

359
00:16:08,001 --> 00:16:09,867
By experimenting on you,

360
00:16:09,870 --> 00:16:12,469
I realize I've
violated your trust

361
00:16:12,472 --> 00:16:16,573
and possibly the
Geneva Convention.

362
00:16:16,576 --> 00:16:18,342
Is that it?

363
00:16:18,344 --> 00:16:19,611
No.

364
00:16:19,612 --> 00:16:22,012
So as to not upset
any of you further,

365
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:24,015
I've asked Stuart
to be my best man,

366
00:16:24,016 --> 00:16:25,183
and he's agreed.

367
00:16:25,184 --> 00:16:27,785
You're all still invited
to the bachelor party.

368
00:16:27,786 --> 00:16:31,923
Uh, he's thinking Costco
and the theme is browsing.

369
00:16:31,924 --> 00:16:34,692
You picked Stuart
over one of us?

370
00:16:34,693 --> 00:16:36,327
Well, I wanted to
choose one of you,

371
00:16:36,328 --> 00:16:38,129
but you all
turned against me.

372
00:16:38,131 --> 00:16:42,033
Picking a best man isn't
about keeping score.

373
00:16:42,035 --> 00:16:43,700
But you're all my friends.

374
00:16:43,703 --> 00:16:45,135
I mean,
if I didn't collect data,

375
00:16:45,137 --> 00:16:47,505
how could I possibly choose
among the three of you?

376
00:16:47,506 --> 00:16:50,275
Well, that's actually
kind of sweet.

377
00:16:50,276 --> 00:16:53,844
Is it? Perhaps I said it wrong.

378
00:16:53,847 --> 00:16:57,915
Look, this is your wedding,
just pick whoever you want.

379
00:16:57,918 --> 00:17:00,318
You don't need to worry
about anyone else but yourself.

380
00:17:00,319 --> 00:17:03,420
You've kind of been training
for this your whole life.

381
00:17:03,423 --> 00:17:05,390
Thank you, Leonard.

382
00:17:05,391 --> 00:17:08,458
And if it helps...
these two are quitters.

383
00:17:11,631 --> 00:17:13,898
(keys jingle)
Hey, what you making?

384
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:15,800
Uh, well, I spilled
the cheese packet,

385
00:17:15,802 --> 00:17:19,269
so we're having mac and nothing.
Oh.

386
00:17:19,272 --> 00:17:21,139
Yeah. I'll just have the mac.

387
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:23,106
“Nothing” gives me gas.
(chuckles)

388
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:28,412
Why are you in such a good mood?

389
00:17:28,415 --> 00:17:29,813
Mm, I just talked to Sheldon.

390
00:17:29,815 --> 00:17:32,717
He apologized about the tests
and asked me to be his best man.

391
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:36,019
Uh, great. After all you've done
for him, he should've asked you.

392
00:17:36,022 --> 00:17:37,621
And Amy's your best friend.

393
00:17:37,623 --> 00:17:39,690
I'm sure she'll come
to her senses and pick you.

394
00:17:39,692 --> 00:17:41,458
Okay, she's not my best friend.
We're not 12.

395
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:43,327
If she wants Bernadette
to be her maid of honor,

396
00:17:43,330 --> 00:17:44,361
I really don't care.

397
00:17:44,363 --> 00:17:45,897
Sounds like you care.

398
00:17:45,899 --> 00:17:47,398
No, I mean, it-it's
just annoying.

399
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:50,034
You know, we talk every day.
We see each other all the time.

400
00:17:50,035 --> 00:17:51,569
She's always there
for me, and basically—

401
00:17:51,571 --> 00:17:54,171
oh, my God, Amy's
my best friend.

402
00:17:55,507 --> 00:17:57,609
You okay?

403
00:17:57,611 --> 00:18:01,312
No, my best friend didn't ask
me to be her maid of honor.

404
00:18:01,313 --> 00:18:02,846
I'm pissed!

405
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:09,554
So, bottom line, what you
did was wrong and cruel,

406
00:18:09,555 --> 00:18:14,425
which the mother of my children
finds oddly appealing.

407
00:18:14,427 --> 00:18:17,061
So she still wants
to be my maid of honor?

408
00:18:17,063 --> 00:18:18,996
Maid of honor, hit woman,
whatever you need.

409
00:18:18,998 --> 00:18:21,265
Make the call.

410
00:18:21,267 --> 00:18:22,600
Look, I know this
is your wedding,

411
00:18:22,602 --> 00:18:24,102
and you can do
whatever you want,

412
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:26,871
but if you think anyone but me
is gonna be your maid of honor,

413
00:18:26,872 --> 00:18:30,140
then you're an idiot because
you are my best friend.

414
00:18:30,142 --> 00:18:31,175
Too late. Bernade...

415
00:18:31,177 --> 00:18:32,509
Bestie!

416
00:18:39,572 --> 00:18:41,839
Stuart, I'm sorry
if it's weird

417
00:18:41,841 --> 00:18:44,041
Sheldon made me best man
instead of you.

418
00:18:44,043 --> 00:18:45,108
It's okay.

419
00:18:45,110 --> 00:18:48,077
I was best man
for two whole days.

420
00:18:50,181 --> 00:18:52,248
No one can take that
away from me.

421
00:18:54,053 --> 00:18:56,219
Except for Sheldon,
when he did.

422
00:18:57,790 --> 00:18:59,456
Although, if you
want to be a part

423
00:18:59,458 --> 00:19:00,457
of the wedding party,

424
00:19:00,458 --> 00:19:03,660
I suppose you could be
the flower girl.

425
00:19:04,897 --> 00:19:06,496
Sold.

426
00:19:07,765 --> 00:19:10,667
Well, I thought Halley
was gonna be the flower girl.

427
00:19:10,669 --> 00:19:12,201
Oh, that's much better.

428
00:19:12,204 --> 00:19:14,004
Sorry, Stuart,
you're out.

429
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:18,508
Hey, so is Bernadette okay
with me being maid of honor?

430
00:19:18,511 --> 00:19:21,978
Actually, I haven't
had the courage to tell her.

431
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:24,081
I guess I should do that.

432
00:19:24,083 --> 00:19:26,850
Uh, yeah.
(clears throat)

433
00:19:28,219 --> 00:19:30,019
Although, as
maid of honor,

434
00:19:30,022 --> 00:19:31,787
your job is to
make my life easier.

435
00:19:31,790 --> 00:19:34,958
(groans)
Damn it.

436
00:19:34,959 --> 00:19:37,995
Hey, Stuart, you still
want in on this wedding?

437
00:19:39,832 --> 00:19:43,033
Not that much.

438
00:19:43,035 --> 00:19:46,402
(sighs)
Fine, I'll do it.

439
00:19:46,404 --> 00:19:49,072
But do me a favor and unlock
the liquor cabinet first.

440
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:57,621
