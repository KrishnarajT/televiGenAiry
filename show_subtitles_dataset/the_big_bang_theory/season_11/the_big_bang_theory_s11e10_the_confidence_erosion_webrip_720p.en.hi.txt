1
00:00:04,883 --> 00:00:06,684
This was a good idea.

2
00:00:06,685 --> 00:00:08,017
It's been a long time
since we've had girls' night.

3
00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:10,053
Yeah, it's so nice to
have a relaxing evening

4
00:00:10,056 --> 00:00:12,255
at home doing nothing.

5
00:00:12,257 --> 00:00:14,325
Yeah, really breaks up
the other 30 days

6
00:00:14,327 --> 00:00:16,392
I've spent on bed rest
doing nothing.

7
00:00:16,395 --> 00:00:19,997
Well, tonight we're gonna
make you forget all that.

8
00:00:19,998 --> 00:00:21,832
You're gonna make me forget
I've been stuck in bed

9
00:00:21,834 --> 00:00:24,032
while a baby uses my bladder
as a kickball?

10
00:00:25,756 --> 00:00:28,038
Hey, you had unprotected sex
with Howard.

11
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:30,440
You deserve to be miserable.

12
00:00:31,611 --> 00:00:34,043
Hey, I need some
fashion advice.

13
00:00:34,046 --> 00:00:36,113
Really? From me?
I would love to...

14
00:00:36,115 --> 00:00:38,015
Actually, Leonard told me
Penny was over here?

15
00:00:38,016 --> 00:00:40,484
Hey, what's going on?
You got a date?

16
00:00:40,485 --> 00:00:42,552
I, uh, do have a date...
with science.

17
00:00:42,555 --> 00:00:45,555
Oh, what's science wearing?

18
00:00:45,558 --> 00:00:49,259
The Griffith Observatory is
looking for an astrophysicist

19
00:00:49,262 --> 00:00:51,896
to consult, and I have
an interview tomorrow.

20
00:00:51,897 --> 00:00:53,664
Oh, I love the observatory.

21
00:00:53,665 --> 00:00:56,133
They tell you your weight
on all the different planets.

22
00:00:56,134 --> 00:00:59,402
Yeah. It's always
bikini season on Venus.

23
00:00:59,405 --> 00:01:01,438
I think you'd be
great at that.

24
00:01:01,439 --> 00:01:02,705
Don't you agree, Bernadette?

25
00:01:02,707 --> 00:01:05,208
Huh? I'm listening.
I'm listening.

26
00:01:05,210 --> 00:01:07,443
I'm not watching The Crown.

27
00:01:07,446 --> 00:01:09,613
I just want to make a
good first impression,

28
00:01:09,615 --> 00:01:12,348
and thought maybe you could
help me pick out an outfit?

29
00:01:12,351 --> 00:01:13,984
Of course.
Let's see what you got.

30
00:01:13,985 --> 00:01:15,686
Yeah, you just need
to pick something

31
00:01:15,687 --> 00:01:17,187
that-that you feel
confident in.

32
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:19,389
I'm sorry.
I left my magic clothes at home.

33
00:01:19,392 --> 00:01:21,892
I'm sure
these two options will be f...

34
00:01:24,297 --> 00:01:27,530
So you-you have
other clothes at home?

35
00:01:27,532 --> 00:01:28,631
Uh, it doesn't matter.

36
00:01:28,633 --> 00:01:30,333
They're talking
to a bunch of people.

37
00:01:30,335 --> 00:01:31,552
I probably won't get it anyway.

38
00:01:31,553 --> 00:01:32,359
Well, don't say that.

39
00:01:32,383 --> 00:01:34,506
Yeah, you have to
believe in yourself.

40
00:01:34,639 --> 00:01:36,339
You know,
before I came to America,

41
00:01:36,341 --> 00:01:37,740
I was filled with confidence.

42
00:01:37,743 --> 00:01:39,410
What happened to me?

43
00:01:39,411 --> 00:01:41,478
Hey, is that Raj there
at girls' night?

44
00:01:41,479 --> 00:01:42,912
Well, hey.
Hey, Howard.

45
00:01:42,915 --> 00:01:44,948
Just remember,
if you fall asleep first,

46
00:01:44,951 --> 00:01:47,817

@elder_man

57
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:15,657
You and Amy having fun
planning your wedding?

58
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:18,727
We're employing a
mathematical approach

59
00:02:18,729 --> 00:02:23,566
called decision theory,
so, heck, yeah.

60
00:02:23,567 --> 00:02:25,467
Heck, yeah?

61
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:29,871
Looks like someone need to put a
dollar in the almost-swear jar.

62
00:02:29,874 --> 00:02:32,007
We've assigned all wedding
decisions randomly,

63
00:02:32,009 --> 00:02:34,109
and each of us
makes half of them.

64
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:36,211
You know, from
venue to officiant

65
00:02:36,214 --> 00:02:41,417
to numbering system for the
tables: Roman or Dewey Decimal.

66
00:02:41,418 --> 00:02:43,251
Why not hexadecimal?

67
00:02:45,656 --> 00:02:48,457
'Cause this is our
wedding, not a joke.

68
00:02:49,259 --> 00:02:51,293
- Hey, guys.
- Hello. - Hey.

69
00:02:51,296 --> 00:02:52,762
Oh, good.
Raj is here

70
00:02:52,763 --> 00:02:55,263
to tell us
today's specials.

71
00:02:55,265 --> 00:02:58,434
Very funny. I have my interview
this afternoon.

72
00:02:58,436 --> 00:02:59,734
Oh. If it doesn't work out,

73
00:02:59,737 --> 00:03:01,470
you're ready to go
on your Mormon mission.

74
00:03:03,107 --> 00:03:04,941
I-I don't understand
what's going on here.

75
00:03:04,942 --> 00:03:06,475
Oh, what's going on here is

76
00:03:06,477 --> 00:03:08,344
I'm up for a job
at the planetarium,

77
00:03:08,346 --> 00:03:10,078
and Howard is
making fun of me.

78
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:13,782
Oh, that's great. You're
both doing what you love.

79
00:03:13,785 --> 00:03:15,584
Well, I'm excited for you.

80
00:03:15,586 --> 00:03:17,720
Oh, thanks, yeah.
I'd be in charge of developing

81
00:03:17,721 --> 00:03:19,788
and narrating all
the planetarium shows.

82
00:03:19,791 --> 00:03:20,957
And I really want this,

83
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:22,591
so it wouldn't kill you
to be more supportive.

84
00:03:22,594 --> 00:03:26,227
But if it did, you could bury me
at the funeral home you direct.

85
00:03:26,229 --> 00:03:30,699
Wait. The premise is that
he is dressed differently?

86
00:03:30,702 --> 00:03:32,467
Yeah.

87
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:35,470
That's true.
He is not dressed the same.

88
00:03:40,210 --> 00:03:41,776
Hey, Dad.

89
00:03:41,779 --> 00:03:43,112
Hello, Rajesh.

90
00:03:43,114 --> 00:03:44,246
How was the interview?

91
00:03:44,247 --> 00:03:45,413
Uh, not so great.

92
00:03:45,416 --> 00:03:47,416
They asked me
what my biggest weakness was,

93
00:03:47,417 --> 00:03:50,720
and 45 minutes later,
they thanked me for coming.

94
00:03:50,722 --> 00:03:55,323
Son, don't take this the wrong
way, but what's your problem?

95
00:03:55,326 --> 00:03:58,994
I would tell you, but apparently
it takes 45 minutes.

96
00:03:58,996 --> 00:04:00,562
You know what?

97
00:04:00,565 --> 00:04:03,165
I bet it's those friends
you surround yourself with.

98
00:04:03,167 --> 00:04:06,001
Like that Howard,
always making fun of you.

99
00:04:06,003 --> 00:04:08,436
Howard doesn't mean anything
by it.

100
00:04:08,439 --> 00:04:09,771
I-I think it's cultural.

101
00:04:09,774 --> 00:04:11,740
His people come
from a very sarcastic village

102
00:04:11,743 --> 00:04:14,009
called Brooklyn.

103
00:04:14,012 --> 00:04:16,512
Don't make excuses.

104
00:04:16,513 --> 00:04:18,713
What kind of friend
acts that way?

105
00:04:18,715 --> 00:04:20,049
Well, I-I guess...

106
00:04:20,051 --> 00:04:21,616
It was a rhetorical question.

107
00:04:21,619 --> 00:04:23,919
A bad friend!

108
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,920
Come on, Dad! That's just
our relationship, okay?

109
00:04:25,922 --> 00:04:27,922
He makes Indian jokes,
and I laugh,

110
00:04:27,924 --> 00:04:31,826
but, you know, with angry eyes
so he knows it's not okay.

111
00:04:31,828 --> 00:04:34,429
I, too, was in a relationship

112
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:37,667
with someone who made me
feel bad about myself.

113
00:04:37,669 --> 00:04:40,302
If you're talking about Mom,
I don't want to hear it.

114
00:04:40,304 --> 00:04:42,505
I'm just saying,
if you replace Howard

115
00:04:42,506 --> 00:04:45,374
with a nice 22-year-old
grad student,

116
00:04:45,376 --> 00:04:48,910
your self-confidence will soar.

117
00:04:51,249 --> 00:04:53,648
All right, Amy,
you're up.

118
00:04:53,650 --> 00:04:56,419
Next decision.

119
00:04:56,420 --> 00:04:57,552
Come on, first dance!

120
00:04:57,554 --> 00:04:59,287
Come on, first dance!

121
00:05:01,758 --> 00:05:03,124
Invitations!
Oh!

122
00:05:03,126 --> 00:05:04,292
That's a good one.

123
00:05:04,294 --> 00:05:05,628
Just a suggestion—

124
00:05:05,629 --> 00:05:09,564
hologram projected out of R2-D2.

125
00:05:09,566 --> 00:05:12,635
Thanks for your input,
but this is my decision,

126
00:05:12,636 --> 00:05:14,737
and I'm gonna go with...

127
00:05:14,739 --> 00:05:17,972
Old English calligraphy
on Egyptian papyrus.

128
00:05:17,975 --> 00:05:20,342
Oh, what a fun mashup.

129
00:05:20,343 --> 00:05:23,044
It's like the chicken
and waffles of orthography.

130
00:05:24,181 --> 00:05:25,648
Your turn.

131
00:05:30,588 --> 00:05:31,886
Ring bearer!
Oh.

132
00:05:31,888 --> 00:05:35,256
Boy, I'm so glad that
R2-D2 is still available.

133
00:05:35,258 --> 00:05:38,093
You know,
this is really fun.

134
00:05:38,095 --> 00:05:40,196
I can't believe that people say
that planning a wedding is one

135
00:05:40,198 --> 00:05:41,597
of the most stressful things
in life.

136
00:05:41,598 --> 00:05:44,499
I know. Not a day goes by
that I don't marvel

137
00:05:44,501 --> 00:05:46,701
how much better we are
than other people.

138
00:05:49,372 --> 00:05:51,340
I'm so sorry the
interview didn't go well.

139
00:05:51,342 --> 00:05:52,975
Yeah, you would've
been perfect for it.

140
00:05:52,977 --> 00:05:54,777
Oh, I just
get so nervous,

141
00:05:54,778 --> 00:05:56,946
and then I start apologizing
for being nervous, and...

142
00:05:56,948 --> 00:05:59,614
You guys don't want
to hear about this. I'm sorry.

143
00:05:59,616 --> 00:06:00,749
Stop apologizing!

144
00:06:00,751 --> 00:06:01,951
Oh, my God!

145
00:06:01,953 --> 00:06:03,652
You sound just like
the woman at the interview!

146
00:06:03,653 --> 00:06:06,287
Have you ever thought
about talking

147
00:06:06,290 --> 00:06:08,724
to some kind of therapist
about all this?

148
00:06:08,725 --> 00:06:10,025
Ugh. Maybe.

149
00:06:10,027 --> 00:06:12,628
Hey, Leonard, do you think
your mom would be available?

150
00:06:12,629 --> 00:06:16,532
Yeah, you don't want to do that.

151
00:06:17,367 --> 00:06:18,867
Talking to my mom

152
00:06:18,869 --> 00:06:21,402
to get more confidence
is like talking to a lion

153
00:06:21,405 --> 00:06:23,439
to get more alive.

154
00:06:23,441 --> 00:06:25,674
Well, my dad thinks

155
00:06:25,676 --> 00:06:28,010
it's because Howard's always
making fun of me.

156
00:06:28,011 --> 00:06:29,612
Well, that makes sense.

157
00:06:29,614 --> 00:06:31,679
Well, what do you mean,
that makes sense?

158
00:06:31,681 --> 00:06:33,948
Well, Howard does make fun
of him a lot.

159
00:06:33,951 --> 00:06:35,885
Well, that's not
all Howard's fault.

160
00:06:35,886 --> 00:06:38,587
I mean, if Raj doesn't want
to be made fun of, then I...

161
00:06:38,588 --> 00:06:42,590
Hmm. I don't know a nice way
to finish this sentence.

162
00:06:42,592 --> 00:06:44,460
Well, so you're on his side?

163
00:06:44,462 --> 00:06:45,794
I'm just saying,

164
00:06:45,797 --> 00:06:48,164
that's what friends do. You
know, they bust on each other.

165
00:06:48,165 --> 00:06:49,497
It doesn't
mean anything.

166
00:06:49,499 --> 00:06:51,199
Well, I'm not surprised
you think so.

167
00:06:51,201 --> 00:06:52,467
Why is that?

168
00:06:52,470 --> 00:06:54,369
Well, you can be
kind of mean to me.

169
00:06:54,371 --> 00:06:57,273
Well, that's
because you're...

170
00:06:57,275 --> 00:07:02,143
Wow. I don't know how
to finish that sentence, either.

171
00:07:02,145 --> 00:07:05,614
You know what? I think we're
both done being disrespected.

172
00:07:06,650 --> 00:07:10,218
I got a few rounds left in me.

173
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:13,222
Attaboy, champ.

174
00:07:14,458 --> 00:07:18,260
Okay, let's see what
we've got so far.

175
00:07:18,261 --> 00:07:21,229
I arrive in a Little House
on the Prairie style

176
00:07:21,232 --> 00:07:23,965
horse-drawn buggy.

177
00:07:23,967 --> 00:07:28,770
Where you are met with
an honor guard of stormtroopers.

178
00:07:28,773 --> 00:07:31,941
Do you think
that might be jarring,

179
00:07:31,943 --> 00:07:34,876
going from wholesome pioneers
to space Nazis?

180
00:07:34,878 --> 00:07:38,347
I see what you're saying.

181
00:07:38,348 --> 00:07:40,348
You're thinking
that you should arrive

182
00:07:40,350 --> 00:07:44,486
in a replica
of Luke Skywalker's landspeeder.

183
00:07:44,487 --> 00:07:47,422
It's not what I'm thinking,

184
00:07:47,424 --> 00:07:49,225
and to save you

185
00:07:49,227 --> 00:07:51,092
the trouble for the future,

186
00:07:51,095 --> 00:07:53,229
it will never be
what I'm thinking.

187
00:07:53,231 --> 00:07:57,098
Well... if the ushers are
so important to you,

188
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:58,600
what if I
propose a trade?

189
00:07:58,602 --> 00:08:03,504
You may pick that, and I will
decide, say, first dance.

190
00:08:03,506 --> 00:08:07,809
Great. Then the ushers
will be... my cousins

191
00:08:07,811 --> 00:08:10,813
dressed in frontier frock coats.
Oh.

192
00:08:10,814 --> 00:08:15,583
And the first dance will be
that we won't have one.

193
00:08:15,585 --> 00:08:18,253
All right. Then our...

194
00:08:18,256 --> 00:08:21,222
second dance will be
the first dance.

195
00:08:21,225 --> 00:08:24,525
Unless we have
no dance at all.

196
00:08:24,527 --> 00:08:26,729
Ha-ha.

197
00:08:27,832 --> 00:08:29,864
Well, if we're changing things,

198
00:08:29,866 --> 00:08:33,869
then instead
of throwing confetti,

199
00:08:33,871 --> 00:08:35,371
we'll release butterflies.

200
00:08:35,372 --> 00:08:38,741
Airborne worms? Have
you lost your mind?

201
00:08:38,742 --> 00:08:40,642
Well, if you're
going to do that,

202
00:08:40,645 --> 00:08:42,176
then I am changing the officiant

203
00:08:42,179 --> 00:08:43,913
to that husky Spider-Man

204
00:08:43,915 --> 00:08:46,881
that hangs out
at the Chinese Theater.

205
00:08:46,884 --> 00:08:51,453
Fine. Wedding
toasts in Latin.

206
00:08:51,454 --> 00:08:55,958
Great. Vows in Klingon.

207
00:08:55,959 --> 00:08:59,127
Then I'm changing the
flower girl to a dog.

208
00:09:00,298 --> 00:09:02,698
And guess what he'll be
scattering instead of petals!

209
00:09:06,703 --> 00:09:09,137
Want to grab
some lunch?

210
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:11,307
You know what?
I don't think so.

211
00:09:11,309 --> 00:09:13,608
Well, let me guess.
You're not eating

212
00:09:13,611 --> 00:09:17,713
because the mean girls circled
your chubby bits in marker?

213
00:09:17,714 --> 00:09:20,882
No. That. That right there.
That's the reason.

214
00:09:20,885 --> 00:09:22,217
You're always
making fun of me.

215
00:09:22,218 --> 00:09:24,153
Oh, those are just jokes.

216
00:09:24,155 --> 00:09:25,654
It's my way

217
00:09:25,655 --> 00:09:27,423
of saying that
we're friends,

218
00:09:27,424 --> 00:09:29,958
and it wouldn't hurt
you to drop a few!

219
00:09:31,462 --> 00:09:34,829
See? No wonder
I don't have any confidence.

220
00:09:34,832 --> 00:09:37,299
Come on. You can't
blame that on me.

221
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:41,602
Why not? 15 years
of constant ridicule. I-I think

222
00:09:41,605 --> 00:09:43,605
our relationship
has become toxic.

223
00:09:43,607 --> 00:09:45,607
Uh, what are you saying?

224
00:09:45,608 --> 00:09:49,778
I think you and I need to spend
some time away from each other.

225
00:09:51,982 --> 00:09:55,416
Look, I... I can see
you're upset, but...

226
00:09:55,419 --> 00:09:59,121
I'm gonna need some
ground rules. I mean,

227
00:09:59,122 --> 00:10:02,724
while we're apart, can I see
other needy Indian men?

228
00:10:02,727 --> 00:10:04,892
Get out!

229
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:10,623
What do you
think will make

230
00:10:10,626 --> 00:10:12,559
the wedding worse for Amy:

231
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:16,262
a cake made with salt
instead of sugar...

232
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,035
or a cake iced
with congealed gravy?

233
00:10:22,905 --> 00:10:25,237
That is a trick question.

234
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:28,574
The answer is:
you as the groom.

235
00:10:30,746 --> 00:10:32,712
Neither of them
will be the actual cake.

236
00:10:32,713 --> 00:10:34,713
I'm just using it
as a bargaining chip

237
00:10:34,716 --> 00:10:38,385
to get Amy to agree to the whole
wedding party getting rings

238
00:10:38,386 --> 00:10:42,454
and us getting one ring
to rule them all.

239
00:10:43,625 --> 00:10:48,929
I forget, which mental hospital
are you guys registered at?

240
00:10:48,930 --> 00:10:49,862
Hello.

241
00:10:49,865 --> 00:10:51,198
- Hello. - Hello.
- Hello.

242
00:10:54,035 --> 00:10:55,301
Really?

243
00:10:55,304 --> 00:10:56,636
You're not
gonna sit here?

244
00:10:56,637 --> 00:10:59,772
I'll sit there as
soon as you leave.

245
00:10:59,775 --> 00:11:01,473
You're still
on this?

246
00:11:01,476 --> 00:11:03,108
I said sorry.

247
00:11:03,111 --> 00:11:06,413
Well, "sorry" doesn't make up
for years of emotional abuse.

248
00:11:06,415 --> 00:11:08,915
Well, what's it gonna take?

249
00:11:08,916 --> 00:11:12,117
You want half my sandwich?

250
00:11:14,155 --> 00:11:15,722
What is going on?

251
00:11:15,723 --> 00:11:19,458
Raj is trying to blame me
for his pathetic life.

252
00:11:19,461 --> 00:11:20,993
His life isn't pathetic.

253
00:11:20,996 --> 00:11:23,863
He's got that whole table
to himself.

254
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,267
One of us should go sit with Raj
so he's not alone.

255
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:30,904
But I'm not done telling you
about my wedding revenge plans.

256
00:11:30,905 --> 00:11:32,338
You're right. Go on.

257
00:11:32,341 --> 00:11:33,573
Okay, well, first,
I'm going to try

258
00:11:33,574 --> 00:11:36,742
to get Amy to trade with me
for hors d'oeuvres...

259
00:11:38,881 --> 00:11:41,481
Oh, good,
you're here.

260
00:11:41,482 --> 00:11:44,016
I've decided
on our centerpieces.

261
00:11:44,019 --> 00:11:47,820
I just hope your family
isn't allergic to asbestos.

262
00:11:47,823 --> 00:11:49,789
Sheldon, please stop.

263
00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:52,158
If we keep doing this, we're
gonna end up with a wedding

264
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:54,627
that neither one of us
will enjoy.

265
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:57,363
Are you saying
you don't want to get married?

266
00:11:57,366 --> 00:11:59,366
No, of course I do.

267
00:11:59,367 --> 00:12:02,836
But that seems to be
the one thing we can agree on.

268
00:12:02,838 --> 00:12:06,171
Maybe we should
just get married at City Hall

269
00:12:06,174 --> 00:12:08,474
and forget
about everything else.

270
00:12:08,477 --> 00:12:12,044
City Hall, hmm.

271
00:12:12,046 --> 00:12:15,347
I do like metal detectors

272
00:12:15,349 --> 00:12:19,285
and the sound of
permits being denied.

273
00:12:19,288 --> 00:12:20,687
Right.

274
00:12:20,689 --> 00:12:22,789
And if we're not enjoying
planning this wedding,

275
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:24,223
then what's the point?

276
00:12:24,226 --> 00:12:26,259
Well, historically,
a wedding was to let

277
00:12:26,261 --> 00:12:28,627
other potential suitors know
that we're unavailable.

278
00:12:28,630 --> 00:12:30,996
But I think matching
T-shirts that say

279
00:12:30,998 --> 00:12:33,833
"Hands off the merchandise"
accomplish the same thing.

280
00:12:34,703 --> 00:12:38,939
So let's pick a day
and just go do it.

281
00:12:41,142 --> 00:12:43,576
How 'bout tomorrow?

282
00:12:43,578 --> 00:12:45,578
R-Really?

283
00:12:45,579 --> 00:12:47,046
That soon?

284
00:12:47,049 --> 00:12:48,548
Why wait?

285
00:12:48,549 --> 00:12:50,616
I mean, it's not that I think
we're living in sin,

286
00:12:50,618 --> 00:12:53,352
but I do like the idea
that our next act of intimacy

287
00:12:53,355 --> 00:12:56,088
will be a legal requirement.

288
00:12:57,059 --> 00:13:00,626
Tomorrow we'll go downtown
and get married.

289
00:13:00,628 --> 00:13:04,064
Or we could go to
Beverly Hills City Hall

290
00:13:04,065 --> 00:13:06,933
if you want
a destination wedding.

291
00:13:10,405 --> 00:13:13,106
Hey. You look
good today.

292
00:13:13,107 --> 00:13:15,241
What happened? What's wrong?

293
00:13:16,011 --> 00:13:17,711
Just tell me. I can take it.

294
00:13:17,713 --> 00:13:20,947
Nothing. I felt bad
about being mean to you,

295
00:13:20,948 --> 00:13:22,448
so I'm being nice.

296
00:13:22,451 --> 00:13:23,482
Oh, okay.

297
00:13:23,485 --> 00:13:24,684
Sorry. I wasn't ready for it.

298
00:13:24,685 --> 00:13:25,952
Try again.

299
00:13:25,953 --> 00:13:27,020
You look handsome.

300
00:13:27,021 --> 00:13:29,389
Nope, still freaking me out.

301
00:13:30,324 --> 00:13:32,125
- Hello, friends!
- Hey.

302
00:13:32,126 --> 00:13:33,693
Hey, what's going on
with your hair?

303
00:13:33,694 --> 00:13:36,395
Uh, nothing. I just decided
to stop straightening it.

304
00:13:36,397 --> 00:13:40,400
Wait, so you were making your
hair look like that on purpose?

305
00:13:40,401 --> 00:13:44,203
When I first moved to America,
I wanted to fit in.

306
00:13:44,205 --> 00:13:45,371
And Howard's hair was straight,

307
00:13:45,374 --> 00:13:47,073
and he was the coolest person
I knew.

308
00:13:47,074 --> 00:13:49,842
Then you never saw
any other people?

309
00:13:49,844 --> 00:13:52,278
You know what, I-I don't want
to talk about Howard.

310
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:54,613
I came here to celebrate!

311
00:13:54,616 --> 00:13:57,616
Yeah. I went back
to the planetarium and told them

312
00:13:57,618 --> 00:14:00,020
they were making a huge mistake,
that I'd be perfect for the job.

313
00:14:00,021 --> 00:14:02,255
I was... I was charming,
I was confident.

314
00:14:02,256 --> 00:14:03,689
And they gave it to me.

315
00:14:03,692 --> 00:14:04,690
Wow.

316
00:14:04,693 --> 00:14:05,658
That's amazing!
Yeah, plus,

317
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:06,659
it turns out the guy they hired

318
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:09,062
got busted
at a sketchy massage parlor.

319
00:14:10,432 --> 00:14:12,399
Oh, so happy ending for you!

320
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:14,400
Oh, and for him.

321
00:14:15,237 --> 00:14:17,737
Yeah, I was on my way
to tell Howard,

322
00:14:17,738 --> 00:14:19,105
and then I remembered
I wasn't speaking to him,

323
00:14:19,107 --> 00:14:20,573
so I came over here.

324
00:14:20,574 --> 00:14:22,219
Mm, don't you think it's time
you two made up?

325
00:14:22,243 --> 00:14:23,644
No.

326
00:14:23,645 --> 00:14:26,145
No, actually.
I don't need his negative energy

327
00:14:26,147 --> 00:14:27,280
in my life right now.

328
00:14:27,281 --> 00:14:29,082
Standing up to him
was-was hard,

329
00:14:29,083 --> 00:14:32,352
but it made me realize
that I can do anything.

330
00:14:32,353 --> 00:14:35,521
And, yeah, it's a little sad,
but, you know,

331
00:14:35,524 --> 00:14:37,656
life is all about...

332
00:14:38,827 --> 00:14:39,925
Uh, sorry.

333
00:14:39,928 --> 00:14:42,594
I thought
you were wrapping things up.

334
00:14:46,333 --> 00:14:48,168
Hey, Howard.
Hey.

335
00:14:48,169 --> 00:14:49,301
Where is everybody?

336
00:14:49,304 --> 00:14:51,003
I could ask you
the same question.

337
00:14:52,874 --> 00:14:56,076
Wow, this conversation
got mean fast.

338
00:14:56,078 --> 00:14:59,378
Sorry. I'm just
in a bad mood.

339
00:14:59,381 --> 00:15:01,146
Yeah? What's going on?

340
00:15:01,149 --> 00:15:03,315
I had a falling out with Raj.

341
00:15:03,318 --> 00:15:05,117
He said I make fun
of him too much

342
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:07,219
and it's wrecked his confidence.

343
00:15:07,222 --> 00:15:09,823
Please, confidence is
like red blood cells—

344
00:15:09,824 --> 00:15:13,193
it's nice if you got some,
but you don't need 'em.

345
00:15:13,194 --> 00:15:16,129
Yeah. I mean,
your life's a mess.

346
00:15:16,131 --> 00:15:18,997
I don't see you blaming
other people for it.

347
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,669
That's right. I grew up in a
loving, supportive household.

348
00:15:23,472 --> 00:15:26,539
This is all on me.

349
00:15:27,476 --> 00:15:30,642
Maybe I'll just hang out here
for a while.

350
00:15:30,645 --> 00:15:33,112
Great. And you can make
fun of me all you want.

351
00:15:33,115 --> 00:15:34,481
No, that's okay.

352
00:15:34,482 --> 00:15:36,015
No, no, no. Go on.
I can take it.

353
00:15:36,016 --> 00:15:38,418
My feelings,
like my extremities,

354
00:15:38,419 --> 00:15:41,154
are basically numb.

355
00:15:43,791 --> 00:15:45,024
Here's your license.

356
00:15:45,025 --> 00:15:46,726
Now, if you wait
over there,

357
00:15:46,727 --> 00:15:48,394
we'll call you
when the officiant's ready.

358
00:15:48,395 --> 00:15:49,728
Do we need a blood test?

359
00:15:49,731 --> 00:15:51,363
No.

360
00:15:51,366 --> 00:15:53,805
Well, then, how will you know
whether or not we have syphilis?

361
00:15:56,404 --> 00:16:00,405
I'm gonna go out on a limb
and say you don't have that.

362
00:16:02,743 --> 00:16:05,410
Okay, Sheldon, you officially
exceeded the number of times

363
00:16:05,413 --> 00:16:08,414
I hoped to hear the word
"syphilis" on my wedding day.

364
00:16:10,184 --> 00:16:11,784
I can't believe
we're doing this.

365
00:16:11,785 --> 00:16:14,286
I know. I'm
getting married.

366
00:16:14,289 --> 00:16:16,856
The new Star Wars
movie's coming out.

367
00:16:16,857 --> 00:16:19,592
We are really finishing
this year strong.

368
00:16:20,428 --> 00:16:23,362
Okay, but
of the two of tho...

369
00:16:23,365 --> 00:16:25,865
You know, I'm not even gonna
ask. I'm not gonna ask.

370
00:16:29,371 --> 00:16:32,605
Are you sad we're not
having a big party?

371
00:16:33,507 --> 00:16:35,909
I'm really not.

372
00:16:37,044 --> 00:16:39,645
I'm here with you.
It's perfect.

373
00:16:42,918 --> 00:16:44,616
Cooper-Fowler?

374
00:16:44,618 --> 00:16:45,952
You're up.

375
00:16:47,756 --> 00:16:49,488
Can you believe it?

376
00:16:49,491 --> 00:16:53,458
We're about to walk in that
door, Dr. Cooper and Dr. Fowler,

377
00:16:53,461 --> 00:16:55,828
and walk out
as a married couple,

378
00:16:55,829 --> 00:16:58,564
Dr. Cooper and Dr. Fowler.

379
00:17:01,636 --> 00:17:03,803
Wait.

380
00:17:04,606 --> 00:17:06,838
I want to have
a first dance with you.

381
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:09,309
Right here?

382
00:17:09,310 --> 00:17:10,475
At our wedding.

383
00:17:10,478 --> 00:17:12,878
Th-This is
our wedding.

384
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:15,048
No.

385
00:17:15,849 --> 00:17:17,750
I want a real wedding.

386
00:17:17,751 --> 00:17:19,751
Well...

387
00:17:19,753 --> 00:17:22,387
Sheldon, it was just
making us fight.

388
00:17:22,389 --> 00:17:24,857
I know. But, Amy,

389
00:17:24,858 --> 00:17:27,292
I never thought
I'd want to marry anyone.

390
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:31,563
So the fact that I found you
is astonishing.

391
00:17:31,566 --> 00:17:35,201
It's-it's like finding
dark matter,

392
00:17:35,203 --> 00:17:36,603
except they're looking
for dark matter.

393
00:17:36,605 --> 00:17:38,370
I wasn't even looking for you.

394
00:17:39,574 --> 00:17:42,174
S-So you're even better
than dark matter.

395
00:17:42,176 --> 00:17:44,176
Sheldon.

396
00:17:44,178 --> 00:17:48,714
Plus, plus, you interact
with light, so I can see you.

397
00:17:48,716 --> 00:17:51,350
And, also, you don't account
for the missing mass

398
00:17:51,353 --> 00:17:53,987
in the universe. Oh, and...
Okay, I think

399
00:17:53,989 --> 00:17:56,623
you're getting caught up on the
ways I'm not like dark matter.

400
00:17:56,625 --> 00:17:58,290
Right. Sorry.

401
00:17:58,292 --> 00:18:01,994
But when you make
a discovery like this,

402
00:18:01,997 --> 00:18:04,497
you don't just take it down
to City Hall—

403
00:18:04,499 --> 00:18:06,465
you tell the whole world.

404
00:18:06,468 --> 00:18:09,301
And so I'll say it
in Latin or Klingon

405
00:18:09,303 --> 00:18:10,670
or-or smoke signals,

406
00:18:10,672 --> 00:18:13,205
if-if that's not
cultural appropriation.

407
00:18:13,207 --> 00:18:14,072
It is.

408
00:18:14,075 --> 00:18:15,407
Okay, so not smoke signals.

409
00:18:16,911 --> 00:18:19,912
But I want
to do this right.

410
00:18:22,183 --> 00:18:23,516
Me, too.

411
00:18:24,752 --> 00:18:26,918
Let's go plan a wedding.

412
00:18:34,895 --> 00:18:37,129
You know, we did get dressed up

413
00:18:37,132 --> 00:18:39,799
and come all the way
to City Hall.

414
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:41,600
What are you thinking?

415
00:18:41,603 --> 00:18:45,805
I have always wanted a permit
to dispose of hazardous waste.

416
00:18:47,642 --> 00:18:49,408
Let's do it.

417
00:18:53,810 --> 00:18:57,780
Do we know if there's life in
the methane plumes of Enceladus

418
00:18:57,781 --> 00:19:00,749
or under the icy surface
of Europa?

419
00:19:00,751 --> 00:19:05,053
Come back on Tuesday
for my next show to find out.

420
00:19:05,056 --> 00:19:08,123
Spoiler alert: we don't.

421
00:19:09,659 --> 00:19:11,626
I'm Dr. Rajesh
Koothrappali,

422
00:19:11,628 --> 00:19:13,828
and thank you for
taking a walk with me

423
00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:16,130
through the stars.

424
00:19:18,301 --> 00:19:20,703
Wow. I never knew science
could be so interesting.

425
00:19:20,704 --> 00:19:23,172
Hey, I talk to you
about science all the time.

426
00:19:23,174 --> 00:19:25,139
Oh, you sure do, sweetie.

427
00:19:26,543 --> 00:19:28,743
Should we go
congratulate him?

428
00:19:28,745 --> 00:19:31,946
I'll do better than that— I'll
give him constructive criticism.

429
00:19:31,949 --> 00:19:36,217
Here's some constructive
criticism: don't.

430
00:19:38,688 --> 00:19:40,989
- I'll catch up with you guys.
- Okay.

431
00:19:42,592 --> 00:19:43,734
Raj, you were terrific!

432
00:19:43,759 --> 00:19:44,828
Oh, thank you.
I was so nervous,

433
00:19:44,828 --> 00:19:46,427
my armpits are like a swamp.

434
00:19:46,430 --> 00:19:49,164
Oh, your hug just got
downgraded to a high five.

435
00:19:49,966 --> 00:19:52,300
Your palms are sweaty, too.

436
00:19:52,302 --> 00:19:55,069
Hey. What are you doing
all the way in the back?

437
00:19:55,071 --> 00:19:56,571
Hiding out.

438
00:19:56,574 --> 00:19:58,773
I wasn't sure if I was welcome.

439
00:19:58,776 --> 00:20:01,175
This is ridiculous.
You guys are best friends.

440
00:20:01,177 --> 00:20:02,845
Of course he wants you here.

441
00:20:02,847 --> 00:20:06,115
You sure? He seems to be doing
pretty well without me.

442
00:20:06,116 --> 00:20:08,282
Look, he was just stressed out.

443
00:20:08,284 --> 00:20:10,184
His life is not better
without you.

444
00:20:10,186 --> 00:20:11,720
Come on. Come say hi.

445
00:20:12,556 --> 00:20:14,123
Okay.

446
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:19,560
Dr. Koothrappali, I just wanted
to tell you that was amazing.

447
00:20:19,562 --> 00:20:21,562
Uh, counterpoint...
To the car.

448
00:20:22,933 --> 00:20:24,732
Can I ask you
a question?

449
00:20:24,734 --> 00:20:26,769
Of course you can.
Ooh, that went well.

450
00:20:26,770 --> 00:20:28,703
Ask me another.

451
00:20:29,639 --> 00:20:32,473
I think
I'm just gonna go.

452
00:20:34,411 --> 00:20:36,444
If there is life beneath
the surface of these planets,

453
00:20:36,446 --> 00:20:38,247
how would we even detect it?

454
00:20:38,249 --> 00:20:40,682
Uh, that's
a complicated question.

455
00:20:40,684 --> 00:20:42,350
Let me start with a simpler one.

456
00:20:42,353 --> 00:20:44,252
Can I buy you a coffee?

457
00:20:44,254 --> 00:20:47,088
A-Also a complicated question.

458
00:20:47,090 --> 00:20:49,657
Because I want to say yes,
but if I drink coffee this late,

459
00:20:49,659 --> 00:20:50,959
then I'll be up all night.

460
00:20:50,961 --> 00:20:53,362
Decaf, genius.

461
00:20:53,364 --> 00:20:54,930
I would love to.

462
00:20:54,932 --> 00:21:01,831
