00:00:04,970 --> 00:00:07,889
Uh, one dumpling left, who wants it?

2
00:00:08,056 --> 00:00:10,726
Maybe you should offer it
to the pregnant lady.

3
00:00:11,309 --> 00:00:14,062
And that would be...?

00:00:15,981 --> 00:00:18,108
Me, Sheldon, I'm obviously pregnant.

5
00:00:18,316 --> 00:00:21,194
You never said it to my face,
and the last time I assumed...

6
00:00:21,361 --> 00:00:24,072
a woman was pregnant,
it did not go over well.

7
00:00:24,239 --> 00:00:26,450
Yeah, I'm still mad at you. Ahem.

8
00:00:27,492 --> 00:00:30,704
You were drinking water instead of wine,
what was I supposed to think?

9
00:00:32,205 --> 00:00:34,249
Sheldon's right,
I would never ask a woman...

10
00:00:34,416 --> 00:00:39,629
if she's pregnant unless she tells me
or I see a human being wiggling out of her.

11
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:43,091
Well, Sheldon, I'm pregnant.

12
00:00:43,258 --> 00:00:45,552
Congratulations. How far along are you?

13
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:48,722
- About three months.
- Only three?

14
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:52,934
Good gravy, how many babies are in there?

00:00:54,478 --> 00:00:58,732
Okay, let's talk about something that
won't infuriate my pregnant wife.

16

- I read an interesting fact about elephants—
- Try again.

17
00:01:04,696 --> 00:01:05,697
I've got something.

18
00:01:05,864 --> 00:01:08,325
I'm being interviewed
on public radio this Friday.

19
00:01:08,492 --> 00:01:11,203
- Cool, how come?
- The university's trying to get funding...

20
00:01:11,369 --> 00:01:14,039
for the physics department.
They want me to talk it up.

21
00:01:14,372 --> 00:01:15,624

Well, they picked
the right person for the job.

00:01:22,672 --> 00:01:25,759
- Thank you.
- I think he bought it.

00:01:51,785 --> 00:01:54,287
Hi, I'm Ira Flatow,
and this is Science Friday.

26
00:01:54,454 --> 00:01:58,041
Joining me today is my guest,
physicist Dr. Leonard Hofstadter...

27
00:01:58,208 --> 00:02:01,920
to talk about all the exciting research
they're doing at Caltech.

28
00:02:02,087 --> 00:02:04,131
Thank you for having me. Whoa. Heh.

29
00:02:04,339 --> 00:02:06,591
I never get used to hearing myself
in headphones.

00:02:06,758 --> 00:02:09,052
- Is that really how I sound?
- Heh-heh.

31
00:02:09,219 --> 00:02:10,387
It is. It is.

[IN DEEP VOICE]
That is good to know.

33
00:02:14,182 --> 00:02:17,435
I told him his voice was annoying,
he didn't wanna listen.

34
00:02:17,769 --> 00:02:20,355
- Hey.
- You're saying it's not?

35
00:02:20,522 --> 00:02:23,066
Just— Hey.

36
00:02:24,109 --> 00:02:27,612
So it's been five years
since the discovery of the Higgs boson.

37
00:02:27,779 --> 00:02:29,865
What's the next big thing gonna be?

38
00:02:30,031 --> 00:02:32,534
[IN NORMAL VOICE] Wow, that's hard
to say, there's so much going on.

39
00:02:32,701 --> 00:02:35,537
We've been collecting tons of data
that could revolutionize...

40
00:02:35,704 --> 00:02:37,497
the way we understand the universe.

41
00:02:37,664 --> 00:02:40,000
For instance,
there's a particle called a squark...

42
00:02:40,167 --> 00:02:41,793
which could prove supersymmetry.

43
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:44,462
- That is interesting. Have you found it?
- The squark?

44
00:02:44,629 --> 00:02:46,339
- Yes.
- No, no.

45
00:02:47,841 --> 00:02:49,801
Wouldn't that be exciting? Heh.

46
00:02:50,552 --> 00:02:53,889
But we're also looking for the selectron,
the gluino, the neutralino.

47

- Oh, and have you found—?
- No.

48

Fun side note,
I went to high school with a girl...

49
00:03:00,186 --> 00:03:01,438
named Theresa Gluino.

50
00:03:01,605 --> 00:03:04,190
But it didn't cost 2 billion dollars
to find her.

51
00:03:04,357 --> 00:03:06,860
She was smoking behind the gym. Heh.

52
00:03:08,445 --> 00:03:09,988
So, what have you found?

53
00:03:10,155 --> 00:03:11,323
Uh, nothing, actually.

54
00:03:11,489 --> 00:03:12,908
Should he be saying that?

55
00:03:13,074 --> 00:03:14,451
Oh, probably not.

56
00:03:14,618 --> 00:03:16,536
Yeah, this is public radio.

57
00:03:16,703 --> 00:03:19,539
Doesn't he realize
dozens of people might hear him?

58
00:03:21,541 --> 00:03:24,920
But I remain confident.
We've got the best equipment...

59

"Ugh, we've spent so much money.

the love of my life, Lady Physics.

"Not half bad."

maybe one of them will start crying.

throwing money at my study.

with my name on it.

00:05:07,856 --> 00:05:08,940
Fingers crossed.

91
00:05:09,107 --> 00:05:11,901

if you had Fowler's Palsy...

92

playing with all your new toys.

Actually, I haven't told him about it.
We've been getting...

95
00:05:22,078 --> 00:05:24,622
so much more funding,
he's been a little sensitive.

your success from him?

was in Boise.

It was in Tahiti.

That's such a relief.

102
00:05:41,473 --> 00:05:43,933
Part of me was worried
I was being unfair to Sheldon.

00:09:29,826 --> 00:09:31,703
Hmm.

172
00:09:37,166 --> 00:09:38,710
Oy.

[KNOCKING ON DOOR]

174
00:09:40,795 --> 00:09:43,089
LEONARD:
Sheldon, it's me.

175
00:09:45,842 --> 00:09:47,260
- What?
- I know you're mad.

176
00:09:47,427 --> 00:09:50,930
I have to write a statement that says
physics is close to a breakthrough.

177
00:09:51,097 --> 00:09:54,017
Since you actually believe that,
I could really use your help.

178
00:09:54,183 --> 00:09:56,894
- Sorry, I can't.
- Come on, don't be like that.

179
00:09:57,061 --> 00:09:59,355
I can't because I think you were right.

180
00:10:00,106 --> 00:10:02,567
- What?
- Look...

181
00:10:03,192 --> 00:10:04,527
not all science pans out.

182
00:10:04,736 --> 00:10:08,072
We've been hoping supersymmetry
was true for decades...

183
00:10:08,239 --> 00:10:10,742
and finally we built
the Large Hadron Collider...

184
00:10:10,908 --> 00:10:14,537
which is supposed to prove it
by finding these new particles and it hasn't.

185
00:10:14,704 --> 00:10:18,124
And maybe supersymmetry,
our last big idea, is simply wrong.

186
00:10:20,001 --> 00:10:22,086
Well, that sounds awful.

187
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:25,506
Now I get why everyone hates me.

188
00:10:26,591 --> 00:10:29,594
On the bright side,
after working together for 15 years...

189
00:10:29,761 --> 00:10:32,138
you finally get to hear me say
you were right.

190
00:10:34,932 --> 00:10:36,601
Yeah, you did.

191
00:10:37,644 --> 00:10:39,228
How's it feel?

192
00:10:39,937 --> 00:10:42,440
Given I might be unemployed, bittersweet.

193
00:10:46,319 --> 00:10:48,154
- Read it back to me.
- Hang on.

194
00:10:49,322 --> 00:10:52,450
"Yes, one might question
the 20 billion dollars to build and run...

195
00:10:52,617 --> 00:10:56,329
the Large Hadron Collider,
but on the other hand..."

196
00:11:00,875 --> 00:11:02,377
Okay. Um...

197
00:11:02,543 --> 00:11:05,755
Oh, "On the other hand,
contrary to predictions...

198
00:11:05,922 --> 00:11:08,800
the Collider didn't create
a small black hole...

199
00:11:08,966 --> 00:11:12,136
that devoured the earth
and life as we know it. So...

200
00:11:12,303 --> 00:11:14,180
money well spent."

201
00:11:17,016 --> 00:11:19,977
This is depressing.
Do you have any alcohol around here?

202
00:11:20,186 --> 00:11:22,313
Not surprisingly,
when Penny moved out...

203
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,482
she took every drop. Um...

204
00:11:24,649 --> 00:11:26,651
Oh, but I do have several bottles...

205
00:11:26,818 --> 00:11:30,530
of Romulan ale that I bought at Comic-Con.

206
00:11:32,407 --> 00:11:34,700
Isn't that just vodka with blue dye in it?

207
00:11:34,867 --> 00:11:36,619
First physics, now Romulan ale.

208
00:11:36,786 --> 00:11:38,704
What else would you like to defecate on?

209
00:11:41,082 --> 00:11:42,792
I thought you were coming right back.

210
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:46,212
I was, but we're both depressed
and decided to drown our sorrows.

211
00:11:47,713 --> 00:11:49,006
In mouthwash?

212
00:11:51,634 --> 00:11:54,429
Man, that is so summer camp.

213
00:11:54,971 --> 00:11:57,557
It's Romulan ale. From Star Trek.

214
00:11:57,723 --> 00:12:01,144
It was briefly legalized during the alliance
between the Romulan Empire...

215
00:12:01,310 --> 00:12:03,896
and the Federation
at the time of the Dominion War.

216
00:12:04,063 --> 00:12:05,857
Aww, now I'm depressed.

217
00:12:08,734 --> 00:12:11,654
The more I told him
about my lab, the pissier he got.

218
00:12:11,821 --> 00:12:13,448
Know what he said to me? He said:

219
00:12:13,614 --> 00:12:17,118
"I hope all your correlations
turn out to be specious."

220
00:12:18,536 --> 00:12:20,246
He said that to your face?

221
00:12:20,413 --> 00:12:21,497
What a dick.

222
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:28,004
You know, you're a successful woman,
you should be able to brag...

223
00:12:28,171 --> 00:12:29,964
about your accomplishments.

224
00:12:30,131 --> 00:12:33,468
So should you. I mean,
the guys are never shy about bragging.

00:12:33,634 --> 00:12:38,598
Tell me about it. Howie texts me
every time his dog levels up in Warcraft.

00:12:39,974 --> 00:12:43,060
Has he ever called to tell you
he found three peanuts in one shell?

227
00:12:43,227 --> 00:12:45,021
Because Sheldon has.

228
00:12:45,730 --> 00:12:47,940
We should be able to do that too.

229
00:12:48,566 --> 00:12:50,276
I guess we can brag to each other.

230
00:12:50,902 --> 00:12:52,278
That's a great idea.

Wow, those things are so expensive.

00:13:16,219 --> 00:13:20,181
I know. Sometimes I just lie down in there
and take a nap.

239
00:13:22,266 --> 00:13:24,560
It's like a million-dollar bunk bed.

240
00:13:25,937 --> 00:13:28,439
At the office, I have two assistants.

241
00:13:28,606 --> 00:13:32,109
I don't even know their names,
I just call them Thing One and Thing Two.

242
00:13:33,819 --> 00:13:35,613
That's great. I don't have assistants.

243
00:13:36,239 --> 00:13:39,534
Oh. I guess that's one of the benefits
of being in the private sector.

244
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:41,577
That and all the money I make.

Okay, so you guys are upset
because the collider thing...

249
00:13:55,466 --> 00:13:56,842
disproved your theories?

250
00:13:57,009 --> 00:13:59,595
It's worse than that.
It hasn't found anything in years.

- You're scientists.

- Cheer them up.
- Cheer them up?

00:14:38,634 --> 00:14:40,720
Do you even know what a scientist is?

265
00:14:42,555 --> 00:14:44,098
We don't need to be cheered up.

266
00:14:44,265 --> 00:14:47,894
It just turns out that physics
is exactly like Lost. Started out great...

267
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:50,605
and turns out just a big old waste of time.

Babies.

And there's nothing worse
than being stuck with two whiny babies.

You're lucky to have two babies.

I mean, look at me, I'm all alone.
I'm never gonna have babies.

You're right, we both do important work.

00:16:02,802 --> 00:16:04,762
It is a real thing.

286
00:16:04,929 --> 00:16:09,016
It happens to be a side effect
of our cholesterol drug.

I'm just saying that my research
may actually change the world forever.

293
00:16:37,795 --> 00:16:40,840
It's fine, I don't need to be
a theoretical physicist.

00:16:41,007 --> 00:16:43,509
There's lots of things
I could use this brain for.

00:16:43,676 --> 00:16:47,096
I could be an accountant for the mob.

296
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:52,309
I could guess people's weight at the fair.

00:16:53,227 --> 00:16:54,729
Okay, this is getting silly.

298
00:16:54,937 --> 00:16:56,188
Is it?

00:17:01,318 --> 00:17:03,279
Okay, that is enough.

your careers are not at a dead end.

Instead of feeling sorry for yourselves,
you need to get inspired.

00:17:11,912 --> 00:17:13,497
- How?
- I don't know.

305
00:17:13,664 --> 00:17:15,458
When I'm feeling down, I go for a run.

306
00:17:15,624 --> 00:17:18,627
Which is exactly why
I'm not 180 pounds, genius.

307
00:17:20,838 --> 00:17:23,174
- I know where we need to go.
- Are we running there?

308
00:17:23,340 --> 00:17:27,303
Because watching drunk Sheldon run
would be the highlight of my life.

00:17:28,471 --> 00:17:30,097
We're going to see Richard Feynman.

310
00:17:30,681 --> 00:17:32,892
Penny, Richard Feynman
is an iconic physicist—

311
00:17:33,059 --> 00:17:36,228
I know who he is, Leonard dressed as him
for Halloween last year.

312
00:17:40,649 --> 00:17:43,069
I had no idea Richard Feynman was dead.

313
00:17:43,235 --> 00:17:48,282
Yeah. Most people don't know
he's actually buried right here in Altadena.

314
00:17:48,449 --> 00:17:52,161
I'm sure they keep a lid on that
to avoid traffic jams.

315
00:17:53,954 --> 00:17:56,415
Oh. Heh-heh. Here he is.

316
00:17:56,582 --> 00:17:58,834
Oh, wow, he's buried with his wife.

317
00:17:59,001 --> 00:18:02,546
We get it, a lady loved you, quit bragging.

318
00:18:03,964 --> 00:18:05,966
Feynman was so cool.

319
00:18:06,133 --> 00:18:09,011
When I was a kid
I'd put on some headphones...

320
00:18:09,178 --> 00:18:11,889
crank up one of his lectures and just...

321
00:18:12,056 --> 00:18:14,308
jam out to knowledge.

322
00:18:15,601 --> 00:18:17,228
This guy knew how to live.

323
00:18:17,394 --> 00:18:19,480
Taught himself musical instruments...

324
00:18:19,647 --> 00:18:23,275
he studied Portuguese
just to give a speech in Brazil.

325
00:18:23,442 --> 00:18:27,154
The only part of me
that's been to Brazil is my bikini line.

326
00:18:28,114 --> 00:18:29,573
Okay.

327
00:18:31,659 --> 00:18:33,452
He did so much.

328
00:18:33,619 --> 00:18:36,288
And here we are,
stuck and letting him down.

329
00:18:36,914 --> 00:18:40,709
You know, Feynman used to say
he didn't do physics for the glory...

330
00:18:40,876 --> 00:18:44,255
or the awards, but just for the fun of it.

331
00:18:45,422 --> 00:18:46,924
He's right.

332
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:50,719
Physics is only dead
when we stop being excited about it.

333
00:18:52,263 --> 00:18:55,266
Even beyond the grave,
he's imparting wisdom.

334
00:18:55,432 --> 00:18:58,144
Um, I'm the one who remembered it.

335
00:18:59,979 --> 00:19:01,981
Give me the bottle. It might be corny...

336
00:19:02,148 --> 00:19:05,943
but I say we pour one out
for all the science homies...

337
00:19:06,110 --> 00:19:07,862
- ... who came before us.
- I love that.

Do it.

339
00:19:14,702 --> 00:19:15,870
Here comes some more.

340
00:19:18,622 --> 00:19:20,749
[SHELDON VOMITS]

341
00:19:20,916 --> 00:19:23,252
Eh, we got to see him run.

342
00:19:27,047 --> 00:19:28,090
[KNOCKING ON DOOR]

343
00:19:28,257 --> 00:19:29,592
Hi, you wanted to see me?

344
00:19:29,758 --> 00:19:33,012
Yes, I wanted to talk about
the e-mail you sent me last night.

345
00:19:33,971 --> 00:19:35,764
I sent you an e-mail?

346
00:19:37,183 --> 00:19:39,226
You bet you did.

347
00:19:40,561 --> 00:19:45,232
"Hello, shalom and aloha
from the grave of Richard Feynman."

348
00:19:45,399 --> 00:19:47,776
Oh, it's coming back to me.

349
00:19:47,943 --> 00:19:52,406
"Please accept the following retraction:
I know I said physics is dead...

350
00:19:52,573 --> 00:19:54,325
but it is the opposite of dead.

351
00:19:54,491 --> 00:19:58,162
If anything, it is undead, like a zombie.

352
00:19:59,496 --> 00:20:02,625
Speaking of which,
if Richard Feynman came back as a zombie...

353
00:20:02,791 --> 00:20:05,586
I would totally let him bite me."

354
00:20:07,254 --> 00:20:08,839
Any chance that's the end?

355
00:20:10,049 --> 00:20:11,842
"I got bit by a squirrel once.

356
00:20:13,302 --> 00:20:15,262
I had to get rabies shots.

357
00:20:15,429 --> 00:20:16,972
I cried so much.

358
00:20:17,139 --> 00:20:19,391
My mother said, 'Don't be a baby.'

359
00:20:19,558 --> 00:20:24,271
In conclusion, physics is great,
squirrels suck, and someday...

360
00:20:24,438 --> 00:20:27,900
I'm gonna put my mom
in a cheap nursing home.

361
00:20:28,984 --> 00:20:33,280
Yours truly, XOXO
Dr. Leonard Hofstadter."

362
00:20:33,447 --> 00:20:34,490
I can explain.

363
00:20:34,657 --> 00:20:36,033
"P.S.

364
00:20:37,034 --> 00:20:38,369
Can you come pick us up?

365
00:20:38,535 --> 00:20:44,208
The Uber driver won't open the door
because Sheldon is covered in blue vomit."
