1
00:00:11,897 --> 00:00:13,209
What are you doing?

2
00:00:13,211 --> 00:00:16,012
Pigeon check for Sheldon.

3
00:00:16,013 --> 00:00:18,047
North side's all clear!

4
00:00:18,048 --> 00:00:20,349
Great. Let's look
at some planets!

5
00:00:20,352 --> 00:00:23,352
Hey, why'd you lug your
telescope all the way over here?

6
00:00:23,354 --> 00:00:24,988
Leonard has one
in our apartment.

7
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:26,723
Yeah, I'm gonna
use Leonard's.

8
00:00:26,724 --> 00:00:30,259
Might as well hold my hand
up like this and squint.

9
00:00:30,261 --> 00:00:32,796
I don't know.
It seemed pretty good.

10
00:00:32,797 --> 00:00:34,764
You know, once
when the cable went out,

11
00:00:34,765 --> 00:00:36,566
I watched an entire episode
of The Bachelor

12
00:00:36,567 --> 00:00:39,401
on a TV across the street.

13
00:00:39,404 --> 00:00:41,638
This one's more
of a professional model.

14
00:00:41,639 --> 00:00:43,273
So was the girl he picked!

15
00:00:43,274 --> 00:00:48,077
This baby's got a ten-inch
diameter with f/10 ACF optics.

16
00:00:48,078 --> 00:00:49,511
And tonight

17
00:00:49,514 --> 00:00:52,414
Mercury is
at its highest elongation.

18
00:00:52,416 --> 00:00:57,986
It makes far-away things seem
close, and Mercury is a planet.

19
00:00:57,989 --> 00:01:00,856
I know Mercury is a planet.

20
00:01:00,858 --> 00:01:03,258
But the-the other
thing was helpful.

21
00:01:03,261 --> 00:01:05,661
Oh. Look at that.

22
00:01:05,663 --> 00:01:08,264
- Neil Gaiman tweeted about my store!
- What did he say?

23
00:01:08,266 --> 00:01:09,898
Uh, "Next time
you're in Pasadena,

24
00:01:09,901 --> 00:01:11,467
"check out The Comic Center.

25
00:01:11,470 --> 00:01:13,268
"Great vibe,
old school,

26
00:01:13,271 --> 00:01:15,304
the owner really knows
his stuff."

27
00:01:15,307 --> 00:01:17,172
Isn't that amazing?

28
00:01:17,175 --> 00:01:19,441
Well, uh, it's no Sandman,
but I guess we can't expect

29
00:01:19,444 --> 00:01:21,977
everything he writes
to be a masterpiece.

30
00:01:21,979 --> 00:01:23,580
When was he in your store?

31
00:01:23,581 --> 00:01:26,449
I have no idea.
I think I would remember that.

32
00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:29,886
Obviously, vibranium is the
most powerful metal in comics.

33
00:01:29,887 --> 00:01:31,920
What, more powerful
than adamantium?

34
00:01:31,922 --> 00:01:33,523
He's right.

35
00:01:33,524 --> 00:01:36,125
Wolverine's claws,
Ultron's outer shell.

36
00:01:36,127 --> 00:01:37,593
Need I go on?

37
00:01:37,595 --> 00:01:40,129
You don't need to,
but you probably will.

38
00:01:41,333 --> 00:01:44,099
What about Wonder
Woman's bracelets?

39
00:01:44,101 --> 00:01:45,401
Good point.

40
00:01:45,402 --> 00:01:49,105
Strong as a metal and
fierce as a fashion choice.

41
00:01:49,106 --> 00:01:50,440
You know,

42
00:01:50,441 --> 00:01:51,874
Thor's hammer's
pretty powerful,

43
00:01:51,877 --> 00:01:54,711
and in the comics,
it's made out of enchanted uru.

44
00:01:54,712 --> 00:01:56,946
Uh, yeah, I think
it's the enchantment

45
00:01:56,947 --> 00:01:58,947
that's powerful,
not the uru,

46
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:01,985
but, uh, thanks for playing.

47
00:02:03,788 --> 00:02:06,154
Oh, man, I can't believe
Neil Gaiman came in,

48
00:02:06,157 --> 00:02:07,230

59
00:02:34,343 --> 00:02:36,944
Can you see Mercury?
Can you see it?

60
00:02:36,946 --> 00:02:38,813
One second.

61
00:02:38,814 --> 00:02:41,616
You know, the Greek
version of Mercury, Hermes,

62
00:02:41,617 --> 00:02:43,385
was worshipped
in Athens

63
00:02:43,386 --> 00:02:46,220
by the carving of
giant wooden phalluses.

64
00:02:46,223 --> 00:02:47,855
Please, Amy,

65
00:02:47,857 --> 00:02:50,592
get your mind out
of the ancient Athenian gutter.

66
00:02:51,628 --> 00:02:55,463
Got another follower.
I'm blowing up.

67
00:02:55,464 --> 00:02:56,730
Great. How many does that make?

68
00:02:56,732 --> 00:02:57,766
High double digits.

69
00:02:57,767 --> 00:03:00,267
The nineties?
Mid double digits.

70
00:03:00,270 --> 00:03:01,935
Hey, uh,

71
00:03:01,938 --> 00:03:03,036
Penny, do you want
to check this out?

72
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:04,373
Yeah, sure.

73
00:03:04,374 --> 00:03:05,773
All right, just, uh,
look through here,

74
00:03:05,776 --> 00:03:07,975
and if you want to take a
picture, just push that button.

75
00:03:07,977 --> 00:03:09,778
Okay.

76
00:03:09,779 --> 00:03:11,278
Oh, what is that?

77
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:14,082
Is it Mercury? I'm really
jonesing for Mercury.

78
00:03:15,184 --> 00:03:16,350
I think it's a
little early

79
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:17,752
for Mercury to
be visible yet.

80
00:03:17,754 --> 00:03:19,286
Playing hard to get.

81
00:03:19,289 --> 00:03:20,988
I like that in a planet.

82
00:03:22,526 --> 00:03:24,792
No, there's something fuzzy.

83
00:03:24,795 --> 00:03:27,562
Is it your teen years?

84
00:03:27,564 --> 00:03:29,564
No.

85
00:03:29,565 --> 00:03:31,465
Yes. Shut up.

86
00:03:31,468 --> 00:03:33,867
Look. Look at that.
I think I see something.

87
00:03:33,869 --> 00:03:35,636
It could just be your eyelash.

88
00:03:35,639 --> 00:03:37,004
It's not an eyelash!

89
00:03:37,006 --> 00:03:38,873
Okay, well, uh,
take a picture. Let's see.

90
00:03:38,874 --> 00:03:41,642
Okay. Here.

91
00:03:44,514 --> 00:03:47,248
Hmm. I do see something.

92
00:03:47,249 --> 00:03:48,982
Told you.
What is it?

93
00:03:48,985 --> 00:03:50,451
I don't know.

94
00:03:50,453 --> 00:03:52,352
Maybe it's a comet.

95
00:03:52,355 --> 00:03:53,588
That would be so cool.

96
00:03:53,589 --> 00:03:54,922
You guys want

97
00:03:54,925 --> 00:03:56,991
to see a real star,
look over here.

98
00:03:56,992 --> 00:03:58,660
What?

99
00:03:58,661 --> 00:04:03,363
I just got retweeted...
by Patton Oswalt's brother.

100
00:04:08,671 --> 00:04:10,838
So, this is really
where Neil Gaiman shops?

101
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:13,808
Neil Gaiman, Nicolas Cage,
Natalie Portman.

102
00:04:13,809 --> 00:04:15,843
The list goes on.

103
00:04:15,845 --> 00:04:16,844
They all come here?

104
00:04:16,846 --> 00:04:20,314
Unless I'm lying.

105
00:04:28,624 --> 00:04:31,326
Who are all these people?

106
00:04:31,328 --> 00:04:33,595
What? Is this
a flash mob?

107
00:04:34,764 --> 00:04:36,764
Are they dancing?

108
00:04:36,766 --> 00:04:40,300
I don't know what today's
dancing looks like.

109
00:04:40,302 --> 00:04:43,338
Hey, guys. That tweet
actually got people

110
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:44,806
to come in.
Isn't that great?

111
00:04:44,807 --> 00:04:47,708
No. I liked the way
the store was before.

112
00:04:47,711 --> 00:04:50,211
You mean empty and sad?

113
00:04:50,213 --> 00:04:52,913
Yes, it was perfect.

114
00:04:52,915 --> 00:04:57,819
Like a funeral home that
sells Pokémon cards.

115
00:04:59,155 --> 00:05:00,487
What am I supposed to do now

116
00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:02,557
if I want to hang out
and read a comic book?

117
00:05:02,559 --> 00:05:04,091
Go sit on the couch.

118
00:05:06,228 --> 00:05:08,530
Next to a stranger?

119
00:05:08,531 --> 00:05:11,098
If I'm going to sit, read,
and ignore a woman,

120
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:13,768
it's going to be my fiancée.

121
00:05:13,769 --> 00:05:15,670
Why are you being
such a baby about the crowds?

122
00:05:15,672 --> 00:05:17,071
You go to Comic-Con.

123
00:05:17,073 --> 00:05:18,139
You— I'm sorry.

124
00:05:18,141 --> 00:05:20,641
You're comparing this
place to Comic-Con?

125
00:05:20,643 --> 00:05:23,545
Well, can I go to the bathroom
here next to a Wookiee

126
00:05:23,547 --> 00:05:25,812
who got his zipper
stuck in his fur?

127
00:05:25,814 --> 00:05:29,617
Wow. We go to Comic-Con
for different reasons.

128
00:05:29,619 --> 00:05:31,285
You know what?

129
00:05:31,288 --> 00:05:34,454
Just give me a copy
of Action Comics 1000,

130
00:05:34,456 --> 00:05:35,990
and I'll be on my way.

131
00:05:35,992 --> 00:05:37,258
Sorry. All out.

132
00:05:37,259 --> 00:05:40,862
Now you just let people
come in and buy them?

133
00:05:40,864 --> 00:05:44,432
I didn't realize
your soul was also for sale.

134
00:05:44,434 --> 00:05:45,600
Well,

135
00:05:45,602 --> 00:05:49,069
it wasn't,
but, uh, make me an offer.

136
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:53,340
Who is that?

137
00:05:53,343 --> 00:05:55,276
Sheldon.
Who is he mad at?

138
00:05:55,278 --> 00:05:56,711
Neil Gaiman.
Who's that?

139
00:05:56,713 --> 00:05:58,946
Not us.
Great.

140
00:05:59,915 --> 00:06:01,715
Guys.

141
00:06:01,718 --> 00:06:03,016
Hi.
Hey.

142
00:06:03,018 --> 00:06:04,117
So, guess what.

143
00:06:04,119 --> 00:06:07,788
That indeed was
a comet last night,

144
00:06:07,790 --> 00:06:09,924
and it turns out,
no one's seen it before.

145
00:06:09,925 --> 00:06:11,425
Wow.
Really?

146
00:06:11,427 --> 00:06:14,261
Look at that!
I discovered a comet! Oh!

147
00:06:14,264 --> 00:06:16,396
What do you mean
you discovered it?

148
00:06:16,398 --> 00:06:17,965
Well, I'm the one who saw it.

149
00:06:17,968 --> 00:06:20,335
In my telescope
that I positioned.

150
00:06:20,336 --> 00:06:22,002
All you did was look into it.

151
00:06:22,004 --> 00:06:24,004
Well, you both discovered it.

152
00:06:24,006 --> 00:06:26,374
You can put both your names
on the registration form.

153
00:06:26,376 --> 00:06:28,442
Actually, we can't.
Why not?

154
00:06:28,444 --> 00:06:30,612
Because when I filled it out,
it asked for name of discoverer,

155
00:06:30,614 --> 00:06:33,514
and I put
"Rajesh Koothrappali" because...

156
00:06:33,516 --> 00:06:37,117
because that's who I am,
and that's what I did.

157
00:06:37,119 --> 00:06:38,418
Are you kidding me?

158
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:41,054
Well, he is the one
who knew it was a comet.

159
00:06:41,057 --> 00:06:43,357
No, he didn't.
He thought it was an eyelash!

160
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,526
And you thought
it was a fuzzy streak.

161
00:06:45,528 --> 00:06:47,995
I mean, do you even know
what a comet is?

162
00:06:47,997 --> 00:06:49,896
Yeah, the thing I saw first.

163
00:06:49,898 --> 00:06:53,735
I honestly don't think that
that qualifies as a discovery.

164
00:06:53,737 --> 00:06:54,936
But I took the picture.

165
00:06:54,937 --> 00:06:56,037
Because I told you to!

166
00:06:56,038 --> 00:06:57,771
Like, if a monkey
took the picture,

167
00:06:57,773 --> 00:06:58,939
did it discover the comet?

168
00:06:58,941 --> 00:07:02,809
Excuse me?

169
00:07:02,812 --> 00:07:05,245
Uh, he didn't mean monkey.

170
00:07:05,247 --> 00:07:07,448
- Get the hell out of my apartment!
- And she didn't mean that.

171
00:07:07,449 --> 00:07:09,951
Actually, I think she did.
You should go.

172
00:07:12,489 --> 00:07:14,454
You look great.

173
00:07:14,456 --> 00:07:15,922
Oh, thanks.

174
00:07:15,925 --> 00:07:17,624
Would you believe
this is actually a dress

175
00:07:17,627 --> 00:07:18,826
from before I was pregnant?

176
00:07:18,828 --> 00:07:20,061
Well, it's not a competition,

177
00:07:20,062 --> 00:07:23,430
but I wore this suit
to my Bar Mitzvah.

178
00:07:23,432 --> 00:07:24,898
Where's Stuart?

179
00:07:24,901 --> 00:07:26,833
I told him
we had a 6:30 reservation.

180
00:07:26,836 --> 00:07:28,569
Well, I'll call him.

181
00:07:30,973 --> 00:07:34,341
Comic Center,
where the real superhero is you.

182
00:07:34,343 --> 00:07:36,076
Stuart, you're supposed
to be babysitting.

183
00:07:36,078 --> 00:07:37,311
Oh!

184
00:07:37,312 --> 00:07:39,379
Shoot. That was tonight.
I forgot.

185
00:07:39,381 --> 00:07:40,881
The store's been really busy.

186
00:07:40,884 --> 00:07:43,384
Well, when can you get here?

187
00:07:43,386 --> 00:07:45,420
Um, I don't think I can.
Listen to this.

188
00:07:45,422 --> 00:07:47,989
I-I was ringing up a customer,
and I heard someone say,

189
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:51,059
"Hey, there's a line,"
and I looked, and there was.

190
00:07:51,894 --> 00:07:54,494
Come on. You can't
do this to us.

191
00:07:54,497 --> 00:07:56,831
I am really sorry. I
will make it up to you.

192
00:07:56,833 --> 00:07:59,533
But it won't be with
a Val Kilmer Batman figurine

193
00:07:59,535 --> 00:08:01,968
because some sucker's
buying that right now.

194
00:08:03,139 --> 00:08:05,907
Not you. This is great.

195
00:08:06,809 --> 00:08:08,975
He says he has to work.

196
00:08:08,977 --> 00:08:10,177
Oh, it's okay.

197
00:08:10,179 --> 00:08:11,679
We can have date night
another night.

198
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,413
But you got all dressed up.

199
00:08:13,415 --> 00:08:16,516
We were supposed to have
dinner and romance.

200
00:08:16,518 --> 00:08:18,518
We'll just have
to divide and conquer.

201
00:08:18,521 --> 00:08:19,720
I'll go to dinner,

202
00:08:19,723 --> 00:08:22,557
and you can stay home with
the Internet and have romance.

203
00:08:25,461 --> 00:08:27,160
Okay, look, I Googled it.

204
00:08:27,163 --> 00:08:29,396
I took the picture,
so it's my discovery.

205
00:08:29,398 --> 00:08:30,865
He stole my comet.

206
00:08:30,867 --> 00:08:33,367
I know, but on the other hand,
do you really care?

207
00:08:33,369 --> 00:08:35,703
Yes, I care.
This happens to me all the time.

208
00:08:35,704 --> 00:08:37,071
People take one look at me

209
00:08:37,072 --> 00:08:38,905
and assume I don't know
what I'm talking about.

210
00:08:38,908 --> 00:08:40,273
Oh, I'm sure that's not true.

211
00:08:40,276 --> 00:08:41,441
I'm sorry. Are you saying

212
00:08:41,443 --> 00:08:43,543
I don't know
what I'm talking about?

213
00:08:43,546 --> 00:08:46,913
No, I'm not saying anything...
ever again.

214
00:08:46,916 --> 00:08:48,883
Look, I'm serious.
The other day at work,

215
00:08:48,884 --> 00:08:51,786
I had this great idea, but
no one was listening to me.

216
00:08:51,788 --> 00:08:54,087
And then five minutes later,
Paul said the same thing,

217
00:08:54,090 --> 00:08:55,956
and they practically
carried him around the room.

218
00:08:55,959 --> 00:08:57,090
Oh, well, what was it?

219
00:08:57,092 --> 00:08:58,692
Well, CPK for lunch,

220
00:08:58,695 --> 00:09:01,129
but that's just one example.

221
00:09:01,130 --> 00:09:02,263
It also happens
with all

222
00:09:02,264 --> 00:09:03,563
the doctors I have to deal with.

223
00:09:03,566 --> 00:09:04,865
You know,
they're so condescending.

224
00:09:04,868 --> 00:09:06,500
I'm so sick
of letting this stuff slide.

225
00:09:06,503 --> 00:09:09,236
I found that comet. Why should
I let Raj say he found it?

226
00:09:09,239 --> 00:09:10,837
I know you're right,
but he is our friend,

227
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:12,672
and this could be good
for his career.

228
00:09:12,674 --> 00:09:15,576
Okay, so you agree with me,
but he still gets his way?

229
00:09:15,577 --> 00:09:17,879
Ah, there you go.
Everybody wins.

230
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:20,114
My God, you're such
a people-pleaser.

231
00:09:20,115 --> 00:09:21,615
You can't stand
making anyone angry.

232
00:09:21,618 --> 00:09:23,618
Why would I want
to make anyone angry?

233
00:09:23,619 --> 00:09:25,385
'Cause it would mean
you were on my side.

234
00:09:25,388 --> 00:09:27,788
Oh, I am on your side.
Hey, hey.

235
00:09:27,791 --> 00:09:31,359
Let's not forget who
you're really mad at here— Raj.

236
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:34,427
Oh, and Paul.
Paul sucks, right?

237
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:38,733
But don't tell him I said that.

238
00:09:39,869 --> 00:09:43,236
Hey, Howard,
did you see that...?

239
00:09:49,845 --> 00:09:52,180
I'm over here, Sheldon.

240
00:09:53,950 --> 00:09:55,917
That was a close one.

241
00:09:55,918 --> 00:09:58,318
I almost went home
with that guy.

242
00:09:58,321 --> 00:10:01,389
You doing okay?
Do we need to go?

243
00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:03,257
No, I'm fine.

244
00:10:03,259 --> 00:10:06,293
I admit all these people did
take me by surprise at first,

245
00:10:06,296 --> 00:10:08,863
but I've learned
that I can accept change.

246
00:10:08,865 --> 00:10:11,032
S-Since when?

247
00:10:11,967 --> 00:10:14,034
I managed it when Amy
switched her shampoo

248
00:10:14,037 --> 00:10:16,504
from Prell
to Prell for oily hair. Hmm?

249
00:10:16,505 --> 00:10:18,105
Although I do miss the way

250
00:10:18,106 --> 00:10:20,941
her head used
to slide off the pillow.

251
00:10:26,182 --> 00:10:27,782
May I help you?

252
00:10:27,783 --> 00:10:29,182
Who are you?

253
00:10:29,185 --> 00:10:31,586
Oh, I'm Denise,
the new assistant manager.

254
00:10:31,587 --> 00:10:33,254
Nope.

255
00:10:38,890 --> 00:10:41,557
Can you believe it?
In the past decade,

256
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:43,826
I have spent thousands
of dollars in that store,

257
00:10:43,828 --> 00:10:45,562
and this is the thanks I get.

258
00:10:45,563 --> 00:10:49,066
You're right. I mean,
he could at least get you a mug.

259
00:10:49,902 --> 00:10:51,268
He gave me a mug.

260
00:10:51,269 --> 00:10:53,470
What do you think
I'm drinking out of?

261
00:10:54,105 --> 00:10:56,306
Do you even pay attention?

262
00:10:56,307 --> 00:10:58,609
Honestly, less and less.

263
00:10:59,845 --> 00:11:02,479
Amy, the comic
book store

264
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:06,082
is like my version
of the country in Black Panther.

265
00:11:06,085 --> 00:11:08,685
Okay, I'm afraid this is
gonna get really offensive

266
00:11:08,687 --> 00:11:10,220
to certain groups.

267
00:11:12,658 --> 00:11:15,325
The nation of Wakanda
was a hidden gem,

268
00:11:15,326 --> 00:11:17,628
and they wanted to
keep it that way,

269
00:11:17,629 --> 00:11:20,764
because they knew if they
opened it up to the world,

270
00:11:20,765 --> 00:11:23,933
everything that was special
about it would get ruined.

271
00:11:23,936 --> 00:11:26,168
Are you done?
Yes.

272
00:11:26,171 --> 00:11:28,772
Oh, okay.

273
00:11:28,773 --> 00:11:31,541
That both made sense
and wasn't offensive.

274
00:11:32,744 --> 00:11:35,778
And to make things worse,
Stuart hired some woman.

275
00:11:35,781 --> 00:11:38,347
There we go.
No...

276
00:11:38,350 --> 00:11:40,484
I'm not annoyed
that she's a woman.

277
00:11:40,485 --> 00:11:42,552
I'm annoyed, and
she's a woman.

278
00:11:42,553 --> 00:11:43,986
No, I get that.

279
00:11:43,989 --> 00:11:46,889
I'm annoyed and I'm a woman.

280
00:11:48,126 --> 00:11:50,259
It's just, Stuart knows
my likes and dislikes.

281
00:11:50,262 --> 00:11:52,428
And I can count
on his discretion

282
00:11:52,431 --> 00:11:54,464
if I pick up the
occasional back issue

283
00:11:54,465 --> 00:11:57,200
of Superman's Pal
Jimmy Olsen.

284
00:11:58,736 --> 00:12:01,270
Which I don't.

285
00:12:01,273 --> 00:12:04,273
Well, don't think of her
as a stranger.

286
00:12:04,276 --> 00:12:06,475
Just think of her as a...

287
00:12:06,478 --> 00:12:11,347
a friend you haven't berated,
lectured or condescended to yet.

288
00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:14,150
I hadn't thought
of it that way.

289
00:12:14,153 --> 00:12:15,585
Thank you.

290
00:12:15,586 --> 00:12:17,988
You're welcome.
You're wise,

291
00:12:17,990 --> 00:12:19,956
and you smell like books.

292
00:12:22,226 --> 00:12:24,094
You really are
the whole package.

293
00:12:28,066 --> 00:12:29,733
Raj, just help me out.

294
00:12:29,735 --> 00:12:31,835
Penny's pretty mad
about this comet thing.

295
00:12:31,836 --> 00:12:33,437
Well, I'm sorry she's upset.

296
00:12:33,438 --> 00:12:35,672
But she didn't discover it.
Oh, come on,

297
00:12:35,673 --> 00:12:37,407
you know she was a part of it.

298
00:12:37,408 --> 00:12:39,109
Just add her name
to the registration.

299
00:12:39,110 --> 00:12:41,378
But I already told
everyone at work that I did it.

300
00:12:41,379 --> 00:12:42,512
My boss was so excited,

301
00:12:42,514 --> 00:12:44,114
he started calling me
Captain Comet.

302
00:12:44,115 --> 00:12:45,648
Which is better

303
00:12:45,651 --> 00:12:48,685
than his last nickname for me:
Dr. Doughnuts.

304
00:12:48,687 --> 00:12:51,020
Because one time
I had two doughnuts.

305
00:12:51,023 --> 00:12:53,657
And two times
I had three doughnuts.

306
00:12:55,027 --> 00:12:58,095
I guess you're just gonna
have to swallow your pride.

307
00:12:58,096 --> 00:13:00,163
I, I, I can't do that.

308
00:13:00,164 --> 00:13:04,066
Sure you can— just pretend
it's two or three doughnuts.

309
00:13:04,068 --> 00:13:05,402
You don't understand.

310
00:13:05,403 --> 00:13:07,070
Leonard, I need this.

311
00:13:07,071 --> 00:13:08,337
My last big discovery was:

312
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:10,539
if you press
your upper lip hard enough,

313
00:13:10,542 --> 00:13:13,275
you can block a sneeze.

314
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:16,812
I told you that.

315
00:13:16,815 --> 00:13:18,981
This is all my fault.

316
00:13:18,984 --> 00:13:21,384
I brought this
upon myself.

317
00:13:21,385 --> 00:13:23,687
I'm a bad scientist.

318
00:13:23,688 --> 00:13:25,788
I'm a selfish person.
No, no,

319
00:13:25,791 --> 00:13:26,856
don't get upset.

320
00:13:26,859 --> 00:13:28,158
You're not a bad person.

321
00:13:28,159 --> 00:13:30,226
Just let me... talk to Penny.

322
00:13:30,229 --> 00:13:31,327
I'm-I'm sure I can

323
00:13:31,330 --> 00:13:32,895
make her understand.

324
00:13:32,898 --> 00:13:35,297
Thank you. You're
a good friend, Leonard.

325
00:13:35,299 --> 00:13:38,869
I'm glad you think so,
'cause I may be living here soon.

326
00:13:46,345 --> 00:13:48,744
Just look at her
over there.

327
00:13:48,746 --> 00:13:50,346
She just started,

328
00:13:50,349 --> 00:13:52,014
and she gets to
put up "Staff Picks."

329
00:13:52,017 --> 00:13:53,549
I've been coming here
for ten years—

330
00:13:53,552 --> 00:13:56,219
I still can't put up
"Sheldon Dislikes."

331
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:57,720
I talked to her yesterday.

332
00:13:57,722 --> 00:14:00,222
She really seems
to know her stuff.

333
00:14:01,058 --> 00:14:02,926
Challenge accepted.

334
00:14:02,927 --> 00:14:05,928
That is not what that was.

335
00:14:06,764 --> 00:14:08,565
Excuse me.

336
00:14:08,566 --> 00:14:10,233
I was wondering

337
00:14:10,235 --> 00:14:11,567
if you could recommend
something.

338
00:14:11,570 --> 00:14:13,403
Oh, sure. You want
to tell me what you like?

339
00:14:13,404 --> 00:14:15,205
I would not.

340
00:14:19,010 --> 00:14:22,711
All right, well, you're
wearing a Green Lantern shirt,

341
00:14:22,714 --> 00:14:24,346
so I'm guessing
you're a DC fan.

342
00:14:24,349 --> 00:14:26,115
Although that's from
the Alan Scott era,

343
00:14:26,118 --> 00:14:27,951
so you're probably not
super into the current run.

344
00:14:27,952 --> 00:14:30,253
How would you feel about
an alternate history

345
00:14:30,254 --> 00:14:33,255
where World War I was fought
with dragons and magic?

346
00:14:33,258 --> 00:14:34,858
That's what I wanted the theme

347
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:36,960
of my tenth birthday party
to be!

348
00:14:36,961 --> 00:14:38,294
Here.

349
00:14:38,297 --> 00:14:40,196
Check this out.

350
00:14:40,199 --> 00:14:42,798
- It's by Kurt Busiek.
- You know, if you're interested

351
00:14:42,801 --> 00:14:44,234
in alternate histories,

352
00:14:44,235 --> 00:14:46,635
Neil Gaiman wrote one
called 1602.

353
00:14:46,638 --> 00:14:49,773
I'm sorry, we're in the middle
of something here.

354
00:14:51,743 --> 00:14:52,942
It is pretty good, actually.

355
00:14:52,945 --> 00:14:54,177
He takes
the Marvel superheroes

356
00:14:54,178 --> 00:14:56,613
and he puts them
into Elizabethan England.

357
00:14:56,615 --> 00:15:01,017
Let me guess— everyone thinks
the X-Men are witches.

358
00:15:01,854 --> 00:15:03,119
Yeah.

359
00:15:05,657 --> 00:15:08,457
Why don't you take this home,
and if you don't like it,

360
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:10,427
return it and I'll give
you your money back.

361
00:15:10,428 --> 00:15:11,528
Just don't tell Stuart.

362
00:15:11,529 --> 00:15:13,897
Stuart who?

363
00:15:16,869 --> 00:15:18,000
Hey.

364
00:15:18,003 --> 00:15:21,470
Where have you been?
I went to yell at Raj.

365
00:15:21,472 --> 00:15:24,139
And? Is he gonna
give me back my comet?

366
00:15:24,142 --> 00:15:25,941
Interesting thing.

367
00:15:25,943 --> 00:15:27,744
Did you cave?

368
00:15:27,745 --> 00:15:29,178
Maybe I did, or...

369
00:15:29,181 --> 00:15:31,114
maybe I did.

370
00:15:32,683 --> 00:15:34,683
But I did realize something.

371
00:15:34,686 --> 00:15:37,720
I-I don't need
to fight your battles.

372
00:15:37,722 --> 00:15:39,022
You... you are

373
00:15:39,023 --> 00:15:40,557
a strong and independent woman.

374
00:15:40,558 --> 00:15:42,292
You have your own voice.

375
00:15:42,293 --> 00:15:44,159
And, to quote
another strong woman,

376
00:15:44,162 --> 00:15:47,062
Katy Perry,
it's time to hear you roar.

377
00:15:47,065 --> 00:15:50,499
Did you just think of that
on your way home?

378
00:15:50,501 --> 00:15:53,235
What do you want from me?
The song was on in the car.

379
00:15:53,238 --> 00:15:54,638
But it doesn't mean

380
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:56,438
that it's not true.

381
00:15:56,441 --> 00:15:58,108
Well, you make a good point.

382
00:15:58,110 --> 00:16:00,342
I'm gonna go talk to Raj myself.

383
00:16:01,245 --> 00:16:03,212
I know I don't say it enough,

384
00:16:03,215 --> 00:16:05,414
but you go, girl.

385
00:16:05,417 --> 00:16:08,350
That was enough.

386
00:16:10,688 --> 00:16:12,688
What's all this?

387
00:16:12,691 --> 00:16:14,858
Well, we missed
our date night,

388
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:17,226
and Stuart's working again,
so I thought we could have

389
00:16:17,229 --> 00:16:18,861
a date night here at home.

390
00:16:18,864 --> 00:16:20,696
Aw, that's so sweet.

391
00:16:20,698 --> 00:16:23,365
Oh. So... is that
really what you're wearing

392
00:16:23,368 --> 00:16:25,402
to our date night?

393
00:16:25,403 --> 00:16:29,172
Well, Stuart's not here
and the kids are sleeping.

394
00:16:29,173 --> 00:16:31,140
I could wear nothing.

395
00:16:31,143 --> 00:16:33,209
You might want
to hold off on that—

396
00:16:33,211 --> 00:16:35,244
we're starting with soup.

397
00:16:36,615 --> 00:16:38,347
Hey!

398
00:16:38,350 --> 00:16:40,649
Wha...? I thought you
were working late again.

399
00:16:40,652 --> 00:16:42,485
I was, but Denise
has got it covered.

400
00:16:42,486 --> 00:16:43,619
Oh.
Oh...

401
00:16:43,621 --> 00:16:45,087
the funniest thing
happened today.

402
00:16:45,090 --> 00:16:48,291
You know the, uh, receipt tape
in the cash register?

403
00:16:48,292 --> 00:16:49,491
It ran out.

404
00:16:50,562 --> 00:16:52,562
I didn't even know
it could do that.

405
00:16:53,932 --> 00:16:55,826
You know, we were just
sitting down to dinner.

406
00:16:55,850 --> 00:16:56,967
Oh. Perfect timing.

407
00:16:56,969 --> 00:16:58,435
I'll go wash up.

408
00:16:59,770 --> 00:17:01,705
There goes date night.

409
00:17:01,706 --> 00:17:03,873
Are you kidding?
Stuart's here! Get your purse.

410
00:17:03,874 --> 00:17:06,076
We're going out.
What about the dinner you made?

411
00:17:06,077 --> 00:17:07,911
Right. Hey, Stuart!

412
00:17:07,913 --> 00:17:11,081
That can of soup
sitting by the stove, that's for you!

413
00:17:11,082 --> 00:17:13,415
You made canned soup
for date night?

414
00:17:13,418 --> 00:17:15,085
And you wore sweatpants.
Let's go.

415
00:17:18,457 --> 00:17:22,025
Oh, and it turns out Denise
is also really excited

416
00:17:22,027 --> 00:17:23,859
for Dan Slott's run
on Iron Man,

417
00:17:23,862 --> 00:17:26,528
because he was her favorite
Spider-Man writer, too.

418
00:17:26,530 --> 00:17:29,132
How about that?

419
00:17:29,134 --> 00:17:33,370
Oh! And guess who goes to art school
right here in Pasadena.

420
00:17:33,372 --> 00:17:34,837
Hmm. I don't know.

421
00:17:34,839 --> 00:17:37,039
Denise?

422
00:17:38,143 --> 00:17:40,343
You're a good guesser, Amy.

423
00:17:40,345 --> 00:17:42,711
Not as good
as Denise, though.

424
00:17:42,713 --> 00:17:44,881
She thought I would like
this comic, Arrowsmith,

425
00:17:44,883 --> 00:17:48,484
and she was right.
Well, was the store crowded?

426
00:17:48,487 --> 00:17:50,220
I bet it was.
I know you hate that.

427
00:17:50,221 --> 00:17:52,288
It was. But if it
weren't for the crowds,

428
00:17:52,289 --> 00:17:54,356
Stuart never would
have hired Denise,

429
00:17:54,358 --> 00:17:55,759
and she's the best.

430
00:18:00,598 --> 00:18:02,097
You must be Denise.

431
00:18:02,099 --> 00:18:03,967
Oh, yeah. How
can I help you?

432
00:18:03,969 --> 00:18:06,001
I'm Amy, Sheldon's fiancée.

433
00:18:06,003 --> 00:18:07,836
Oh. I got to be honest,

434
00:18:07,838 --> 00:18:10,839
I wasn't a hundred percent
sure you were real.

435
00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:16,011
Oh, I am. And I heard you and
Sheldon had a great time today

436
00:18:16,013 --> 00:18:17,380
talking about comic books.

437
00:18:17,382 --> 00:18:18,714
We did.
Great.

438
00:18:18,717 --> 00:18:20,884
Here's what's gonna happen.

439
00:18:20,885 --> 00:18:22,551
You're gonna teach me
how to do that.

440
00:18:22,554 --> 00:18:23,685
Do what?

441
00:18:23,688 --> 00:18:25,555
Pretend to like comic books.

442
00:18:25,557 --> 00:18:27,990
Oh, no, I actually
like comic books.

443
00:18:27,992 --> 00:18:29,759
All right, let's not get
hung up on semantics.

444
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:31,827
It's late, we got
a lot of work to do.

445
00:18:41,839 --> 00:18:44,007
I'm sorry.

446
00:18:44,009 --> 00:18:45,674
I haven't even said
anything yet.

447
00:18:45,676 --> 00:18:48,010
I know, but I heard your
footsteps coming up the stairs,

448
00:18:48,012 --> 00:18:49,511
and they sounded angry.

449
00:18:49,513 --> 00:18:52,548
They are angry.
I'm mad at you.

450
00:18:52,550 --> 00:18:54,316
And you have every
right to be, okay?

451
00:18:54,318 --> 00:18:55,984
I was being...
I was being a jerk.

452
00:18:55,987 --> 00:18:59,655
We did this together, and
I hogged all of the credit.

453
00:18:59,657 --> 00:19:03,125
And after you've been such a good friend
to me over the years.

454
00:19:03,127 --> 00:19:06,496
Like, I wouldn't even be able to talk
to women if it wasn't for you, so...

455
00:19:06,498 --> 00:19:09,999
so I'm... I'm gonna make sure
that your name is on the comet.

456
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,334
Thank you.

457
00:19:11,336 --> 00:19:14,203
Even if it's
professionally embarrassing.

458
00:19:14,205 --> 00:19:18,407
You know, or maybe put me
on thin ice at work.

459
00:19:18,410 --> 00:19:20,809
I may lose my funding.

460
00:19:20,811 --> 00:19:24,413
I still, uh...
still want to make this right.

461
00:19:24,415 --> 00:19:26,915
Good. Bye.

462
00:19:29,469 --> 00:19:33,036
That worked way better
with Leonard.

463
00:19:40,066 --> 00:19:42,833
- Hello.
- Hi.

464
00:19:43,403 --> 00:19:45,870
Why are you reading
a comic book?

465
00:19:45,872 --> 00:19:47,905
Denise recommended it to me.

466
00:19:47,907 --> 00:19:49,540
It's the Rebirth Omnibus.

467
00:19:49,542 --> 00:19:52,309
She thought it would be
a good entry point for me

468
00:19:52,312 --> 00:19:54,378
into the DC Universe—
and I have to say,

469
00:19:54,381 --> 00:19:55,354
- I really do like...
- You know, Amy,

470
00:19:55,355 --> 00:19:57,585
Amy, I've talked a lot about
comic books lately,

471
00:19:57,608 --> 00:19:58,930
can we talk about something else?

472
