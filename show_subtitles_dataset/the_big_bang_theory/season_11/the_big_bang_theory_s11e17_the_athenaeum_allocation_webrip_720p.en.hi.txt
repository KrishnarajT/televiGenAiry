1
00:00:08,987 --> 00:00:12,055
Oh, my God, I can't believe
how big Halley's getting.

2
00:00:12,058 --> 00:00:13,257
Yeah— where's Howard?

3
00:00:13,259 --> 00:00:14,425
He's changing Michael.

4
00:00:14,427 --> 00:00:16,060
A-All done. You know, fun fact,

5
00:00:16,062 --> 00:00:19,496
did you know baby boys
can pee straight up?

6
00:00:20,365 --> 00:00:23,099
Grown-up boys, too.

7
00:00:23,102 --> 00:00:25,669
Why would we high-five that?

8
00:00:26,371 --> 00:00:27,870
So how are you guys?

9
00:00:27,873 --> 00:00:29,239
Really good.

10
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:31,141
Except for when we went
grocery shopping,

11
00:00:31,143 --> 00:00:33,409
and the checkout lady asked
when I was due.

12
00:00:33,411 --> 00:00:34,745
But you handled it well.

13
00:00:37,984 --> 00:00:40,517
Well, if you guys need help,
I'd be happy to come over.

14
00:00:40,518 --> 00:00:43,119
Oh, thanks, but we're really
trying to enjoy this family time

15
00:00:43,121 --> 00:00:44,921
before we both go back to work.

16
00:00:44,923 --> 00:00:46,356
Okay, well, we all miss you.

17
00:00:46,359 --> 00:00:48,258
You guys, too.
Bye.

18
00:00:48,259 --> 00:00:49,859
Ah.

19
00:00:49,862 --> 00:00:51,862
Boy, seeing them
all together like that

20
00:00:51,863 --> 00:00:55,365
has got my biological clock
ticking like crazy.

21
00:00:56,335 --> 00:00:58,201
Yeah, I don't think men have...

22
00:00:58,204 --> 00:00:59,603
I do.

23
00:01:00,805 --> 00:01:02,271
- Hi.
- Hello.

24
00:01:02,274 --> 00:01:03,407
Hey, guys.
Hey.

25
00:01:03,408 --> 00:01:05,308
Good news, we have
save the date cards.

26
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:06,609
Oh.

27
00:01:06,612 --> 00:01:09,579
Huh, didn't go with
my calligrapher. Interesting.

28
00:01:10,883 --> 00:01:12,515
What is this picture?

29
00:01:12,518 --> 00:01:14,717
Oh, it's an MRI
of our brains photoshopped

30
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:16,220
to look like they're kissing.

31
00:01:17,256 --> 00:01:19,023
Is it too sexy?

32
00:01:19,024 --> 00:01:21,225
It's too something.

33
00:01:22,627 --> 00:01:24,494
Guys, May 12, that's exciting.

34
00:01:24,496 --> 00:01:26,229
I know.
Do you guys have

35
00:01:26,232 --> 00:01:28,032
a location yet? 'Cause you
don't have a lot of time.

36
00:01:28,033 --> 00:01:29,500
Hey, it took us nine
months to pick a date,

37
00:01:29,502 --> 00:01:31,634
and a week to decide if
brains can have lips on them,

38
00:01:31,637 --> 00:01:33,603

@elder_man

49
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,381
Michael's out.

50
00:02:01,383 --> 00:02:03,216
So is Halley.

51
00:02:03,217 --> 00:02:05,317
Oh, my God, he's so cute.

52
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:07,086
So is she.

53
00:02:07,089 --> 00:02:08,521
Switch?

54
00:02:08,523 --> 00:02:10,723
Yeah.

55
00:02:12,761 --> 00:02:15,328
Oh, my God, he's so cute.

56
00:02:15,329 --> 00:02:16,763
So is she.

57
00:02:16,764 --> 00:02:19,098
I just love them so much.

58
00:02:19,101 --> 00:02:21,033
Me, too.

59
00:02:21,036 --> 00:02:23,603
My heart feels
like it's gonna explode.

60
00:02:23,604 --> 00:02:26,773
Of course, it's full of brisket,
so it probably will.

61
00:02:27,709 --> 00:02:30,609
Oh, I didn't even
know I was capable

62
00:02:30,612 --> 00:02:32,645
of loving someone so much.

63
00:02:32,648 --> 00:02:34,781
More than me?

64
00:02:34,782 --> 00:02:35,916
Wha— oh, uh...

65
00:02:35,918 --> 00:02:37,918
I'm just messing with you.

66
00:02:37,919 --> 00:02:40,185
I totally love them
more than you.

67
00:02:40,187 --> 00:02:41,887
I get that.

68
00:02:41,889 --> 00:02:43,556
I would take a bullet for them.

69
00:02:43,559 --> 00:02:48,027
But I would get seriously
mutilated for you.

70
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:49,628
That's sweet.

71
00:02:49,631 --> 00:02:51,664
But you should know,
if you got seriously mutilated,

72
00:02:51,667 --> 00:02:54,401
I might dump you.

73
00:02:54,402 --> 00:02:55,834
You'd be crazy not to.

74
00:02:55,836 --> 00:02:58,103
Even unmutilated,
I'm no prize.

75
00:03:00,675 --> 00:03:03,442
You know, I'm really happy
with our wedding date.

76
00:03:03,445 --> 00:03:07,079
The month squared equals the
square of the sum of the members

77
00:03:07,082 --> 00:03:09,149
of the set of prime factors
of the day.

78
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:11,952
Isn't that romantic?

79
00:03:11,954 --> 00:03:13,820
Yes, it's like
that Shakespeare sonnet,

80
00:03:13,822 --> 00:03:15,354
“Shall I compare thee to a day

81
00:03:15,357 --> 00:03:17,923
that's also a really weird
math problem.”

82
00:03:19,394 --> 00:03:20,560
It's a shame you're joking.

83
00:03:20,561 --> 00:03:23,228
That'd be a lovely reading
at our ceremony.

84
00:03:23,231 --> 00:03:25,431
Well, we only have
two months to find a venue,

85
00:03:25,434 --> 00:03:26,865
and I had a thought.

86
00:03:26,868 --> 00:03:29,369
What about the Athenaeum club
at Caltech?

87
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:32,305
Albert Einstein
was a member there.

88
00:03:32,306 --> 00:03:33,440
It's beautiful.
Yeah,

89
00:03:33,442 --> 00:03:36,008
and Albert Einstein
was a member there.

90
00:03:36,011 --> 00:03:37,176
It's close.

91
00:03:37,179 --> 00:03:39,579
And Albert Einstein
was a member there.

92
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:41,847
And Albert Einstein
was a member there.

93
00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:43,128
Ah.

94
00:03:43,130 --> 00:03:45,363
Now you sound like a woman
who wants to get married.

95
00:03:46,833 --> 00:03:48,032
So you're interested?

96
00:03:48,035 --> 00:03:49,199
Oh, of course.

97
00:03:49,202 --> 00:03:51,202
Yeah, but that club
is extremely exclusive.

98
00:03:51,204 --> 00:03:53,204
You know, Leonard's been trying
to get us in there for years,

99
00:03:53,205 --> 00:03:54,371
but no luck.

100
00:03:54,374 --> 00:03:55,840
Well, that's odd.

101
00:03:55,841 --> 00:03:58,008
When I called, they said they'd
be excited to give us a tour.

102
00:03:58,011 --> 00:03:59,310
Well, I suppose
we can give it a look,

103
00:03:59,312 --> 00:04:01,346
and if it doesn't work out,
I hear that there is

104
00:04:01,347 --> 00:04:05,783
a nearby Chinese restaurant
that Einstein used to frequent.

105
00:04:05,786 --> 00:04:09,321
Or, we pick a place we like,

106
00:04:09,322 --> 00:04:11,455
and don't worry about Einstein.

107
00:04:11,458 --> 00:04:14,826
Boy, reality TV is right;
brides are crazy.

108
00:04:18,131 --> 00:04:20,698
So, how has it been,
being home with two kids?

109
00:04:20,701 --> 00:04:23,702
Oh, tiring, but super rewarding.

110
00:04:23,704 --> 00:04:26,870
Oh, like Pilates, yeah, got it.

111
00:04:26,872 --> 00:04:30,675
Honestly, it's gonna be hard
when we both go back to work.

112
00:04:30,676 --> 00:04:32,711
I've been thinking
maybe it would be better

113
00:04:32,713 --> 00:04:36,081
if one of us decided
to stay home.

114
00:04:36,082 --> 00:04:40,618
I don't know, I was raised
by servants, and look at me.

115
00:04:41,721 --> 00:04:43,053
I literally can't tell

116
00:04:43,055 --> 00:04:44,788
if you think that's good or bad.

117
00:04:44,791 --> 00:04:47,425
Well, on one hand, they filled
my tub with scented oils

118
00:04:47,426 --> 00:04:49,426
and brought me honeyed sweets;
on the other hand,

119
00:04:49,428 --> 00:04:51,829
I spent my twenties incapable
of talking to women.

120
00:04:51,832 --> 00:04:56,233
So you know, pros and cons.

121
00:04:57,070 --> 00:04:58,670
Here's my dilemma:

122
00:04:58,671 --> 00:05:00,738
I...
kind of want to stay home.

123
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:03,908
But Bernadette is a way better
parent than I am.

124
00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:05,610
Wait, does Bernadette want
to stay home?

125
00:05:05,612 --> 00:05:07,678
I don't know. She's really
invested in her career,

126
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,447
and she's doing great.

127
00:05:09,449 --> 00:05:11,248
I think it should be me.

128
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:13,384
Wow, I admire you, Howard.

129
00:05:13,387 --> 00:05:14,685
I-It would be hard for me

130
00:05:14,687 --> 00:05:18,255
to buck traditional gender roles
like that.

131
00:05:19,325 --> 00:05:23,360
Didn't you see Taylor Swift
twice this month?

132
00:05:24,697 --> 00:05:29,000
Yeah, because she's hot,
not because she sings my truth.

133
00:05:31,437 --> 00:05:35,038
Did Albert Einstein ever sit
in any of these chairs?

134
00:05:35,041 --> 00:05:36,507
I think these are fairly new.

135
00:05:36,509 --> 00:05:38,543
But Stephen Hawking's
eaten here a lot.

136
00:05:38,545 --> 00:05:41,445
Yeah, but he brings
his own chair, you know?

137
00:05:43,048 --> 00:05:44,983
Well, it seems kind of perfect,

138
00:05:44,985 --> 00:05:46,450
and it's close enough
to your office,

139
00:05:46,452 --> 00:05:48,152
so you can use the
bathroom you like.

140
00:05:48,154 --> 00:05:50,889
Mm. I put a sticker
over the auto-flush,

141
00:05:50,891 --> 00:05:53,391
so it doesn't startle me.

142
00:05:55,127 --> 00:05:56,995
Here's my card.
Why don't you two talk it over,

143
00:05:56,997 --> 00:05:59,163
and I will check to see
if our soup spoons

144
00:05:59,166 --> 00:06:02,901
are “deeper than they are wide"

145
00:06:04,036 --> 00:06:06,838
What? Too deep
is a ladle, not a spoon.

146
00:06:07,707 --> 00:06:10,074
I really like it.

147
00:06:10,075 --> 00:06:12,377
Mm. Oh, I must admit,
I do, as well.

148
00:06:12,379 --> 00:06:15,747
I— look at how somber all
the men in these portraits are.

149
00:06:15,748 --> 00:06:17,949
I feel like that sets
a good tone for our wedding.

150
00:06:19,286 --> 00:06:20,918
Is that Leonard?

151
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:24,355
Oh, no, no, these are all dead,
accomplished scientists.

152
00:06:24,356 --> 00:06:27,724
Leonard will only ever be
one of those things.

153
00:06:27,726 --> 00:06:32,497
I mean, Leonard and Penny
are right there.

154
00:06:32,498 --> 00:06:35,166
But he told me he checked on
our membership just last week,

155
00:06:35,168 --> 00:06:38,168
and we were
still 400th in line.

156
00:06:38,170 --> 00:06:40,471
I'm sure there's
an innocent explanation

157
00:06:40,473 --> 00:06:42,639
that won't ruin my day at all.

158
00:06:43,509 --> 00:06:44,541
Leonard.

159
00:06:44,543 --> 00:06:45,676
- Oh, hey.
- Hey.

160
00:06:45,678 --> 00:06:46,743
How did you get in here?

161
00:06:46,745 --> 00:06:48,812
What do you mean?
Leonard's a member.

162
00:06:49,649 --> 00:06:52,416
You told me
it was incredibly exclusive.

163
00:06:52,418 --> 00:06:56,253
Y-Yeah, look, about that,
I lied.

164
00:06:57,490 --> 00:06:58,858
Hey, wait, you told me
it was exclusive, too.

165
00:06:58,882 --> 00:06:59,557
Mm-hmm.

166
00:06:59,558 --> 00:07:03,827
I avoided him and impressed you,
all with the same lie.

167
00:07:03,829 --> 00:07:06,029
Damn, Hofstadter, didn't
think you had it in you.

168
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:09,834
Well, I'm not sure I know
how I feel about this place now.

169
00:07:09,836 --> 00:07:11,401
Then don't turn around.

170
00:07:11,404 --> 00:07:13,538
Cooper!

171
00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:19,344
Oh, good, you're here.

172
00:07:19,346 --> 00:07:20,844
There's...
something

173
00:07:20,846 --> 00:07:22,714
I want to talk to you about.

174
00:07:22,716 --> 00:07:24,516
We're not putting a TV
in the bathroom.

175
00:07:24,517 --> 00:07:26,384
That's how you get hemorrhoids.

176
00:07:26,385 --> 00:07:29,387
No, this is important.

177
00:07:29,389 --> 00:07:32,524
Uh, I was thinking
maybe one of us should

178
00:07:32,526 --> 00:07:34,558
stay home full-time,
with the kids.

179
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,661
Oh great,
so I have to give up my job

180
00:07:36,663 --> 00:07:38,795
and everything I've worked for?

181
00:07:38,798 --> 00:07:41,598
Actually, I was thinking
I should stay home.

182
00:07:41,601 --> 00:07:43,834
Oh, so I have to abandon
my children and go back to work,

183
00:07:43,836 --> 00:07:46,670
while you get to stay home
and bond with them?

184
00:07:46,673 --> 00:07:49,841
You just said
you didn't want to.

185
00:07:49,843 --> 00:07:54,678
No, I don't want to have to, but
if I want to, I should get to.

186
00:07:56,283 --> 00:07:57,415
Do you want to?

187
00:07:57,416 --> 00:07:59,817
Maybe I do.

188
00:07:59,819 --> 00:08:01,819
What if I also want to?

189
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:03,454
Well, I don't know, we can't

190
00:08:03,456 --> 00:08:04,589
both stay home.

191
00:08:04,591 --> 00:08:06,791
Don't you think
you should go back to work,

192
00:08:06,793 --> 00:08:08,759
because you make more money?

193
00:08:08,762 --> 00:08:10,894
Don't you think
you should make more money?

194
00:08:12,432 --> 00:08:13,932
I think it's pretty sexist
of you to say

195
00:08:13,933 --> 00:08:16,601
a dad can't stay home
with his children.

196
00:08:16,603 --> 00:08:19,070
You know what else is sexist,
the phrase “suck it,”

197
00:08:19,072 --> 00:08:21,072
yet, here we are.

198
00:08:23,610 --> 00:08:26,644
I can't believe
Leonard lied to me.

199
00:08:26,646 --> 00:08:28,279
What are we gonna
find out next,

200
00:08:28,281 --> 00:08:31,949
that he's not really
lactose intolerant, hmm?

201
00:08:31,952 --> 00:08:35,954
He's just friends with
an invisible trumpet player?

202
00:08:35,956 --> 00:08:39,523
I know you're upset, but if
we want to book the Athenaeum,

203
00:08:39,526 --> 00:08:42,093
we really should do it
now, and then, I promise,

204
00:08:42,094 --> 00:08:46,263
we'll have our whole lives
to complain about Leonard.

205
00:08:46,266 --> 00:08:50,969
Aw, somebody got a
head start on her vows.

206
00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:52,136
So do we agree?

207
00:08:52,137 --> 00:08:53,670
Do we want to get married there?

208
00:08:53,672 --> 00:08:55,238
I don't know.

209
00:08:55,241 --> 00:08:56,608
I mean, Einstein was a member.

210
00:08:56,609 --> 00:08:57,775
I like that.

211
00:08:57,776 --> 00:08:59,042
You know? But...

212
00:08:59,045 --> 00:09:03,614
Leonard's a member,
and that really steams my clams.

213
00:09:03,617 --> 00:09:04,882
Oh, I love it
when you're folksy.

214
00:09:04,883 --> 00:09:07,050
I'm just gonna call.

215
00:09:07,052 --> 00:09:09,820
On the other hand, shaming
Leonard during our wedding

216
00:09:09,823 --> 00:09:11,388
at the very place he betrayed me

217
00:09:11,391 --> 00:09:15,627
does have
a beautiful symmetry to it.

218
00:09:15,628 --> 00:09:18,762
That's nice, it'll be your first
petty act as a married man.

219
00:09:20,599 --> 00:09:22,800
Uh— oh, hi, Kathleen?

220
00:09:22,801 --> 00:09:24,835
Yeah, this is Amy from earlier.

221
00:09:24,838 --> 00:09:28,372
I'd like to go ahead
and reserve May 12.

222
00:09:28,374 --> 00:09:29,806
Although, it is our wedding.

223
00:09:29,809 --> 00:09:33,810
I— maybe it shouldn't be
all about revenge.

224
00:09:33,813 --> 00:09:35,979
Oh, I see.

225
00:09:35,982 --> 00:09:38,815
Okay, t-thanks.

226
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:42,887
Someone booked our date.

227
00:09:42,888 --> 00:09:44,055
Uh... What?

228
00:09:44,056 --> 00:09:45,890
Who?

229
00:09:45,892 --> 00:09:48,825
Well, well, well.

230
00:09:50,262 --> 00:09:52,896
This is a pickle.

231
00:09:52,898 --> 00:09:54,666
Yes, so,

232
00:09:54,667 --> 00:09:56,901
if you will just move
your birthday party

233
00:09:56,902 --> 00:10:00,003
to a different location,
everything will be fine.

234
00:10:00,006 --> 00:10:01,872
Ugh, i-it's tricky.

235
00:10:01,874 --> 00:10:03,306
I don't want to move my party,

236
00:10:03,309 --> 00:10:05,075
but I also don't want
to help you—

237
00:10:05,078 --> 00:10:07,811
oh, wait,
I don't have a problem.

238
00:10:09,049 --> 00:10:11,049
No. I do.

239
00:10:11,050 --> 00:10:13,184
Yeah, you do.

240
00:10:17,041 --> 00:10:18,874
Morning.

241
00:10:18,877 --> 00:10:20,444
Hey, where you been?

242
00:10:20,445 --> 00:10:21,777
Oh, nowhere special.

243
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:23,347
Just the park,
the farmer's market,

244
00:10:23,348 --> 00:10:24,948
then we hopped on the Gold Line
to Chinatown

245
00:10:24,949 --> 00:10:26,617
because it's important
for the kids

246
00:10:26,618 --> 00:10:28,551
to experience other cultures.

247
00:10:28,554 --> 00:10:30,487
What have you been doing?

248
00:10:30,488 --> 00:10:33,022
It's 8:00 a.m. Sleeping.

249
00:10:33,025 --> 00:10:34,657
Oh. So are the kids.

250
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:35,892
I guess they take after you.

251
00:10:38,796 --> 00:10:41,665
You're just trying to prove that
you'd do a better job than me.

252
00:10:41,666 --> 00:10:45,801
You're pretty sharp
having just woken up.

253
00:10:45,804 --> 00:10:49,039
Howard, we both know
you can't keep up this pace.

254
00:10:49,041 --> 00:10:52,209
By this afternoon you're gonna
be passed out on the couch

255
00:10:52,210 --> 00:10:54,810
and I'm gonna have three
exhausted babies to deal with.

256
00:10:54,813 --> 00:10:56,613
Not true. I got this.

257
00:10:56,614 --> 00:10:59,348
You know, in fact, why don't you
take the day off?

258
00:10:59,350 --> 00:11:01,785
Mm, fine. Maybe I'll have lunch
with Penny.

259
00:11:01,786 --> 00:11:03,719
Take your time.

260
00:11:03,722 --> 00:11:05,021
Get a massage.

261
00:11:05,023 --> 00:11:08,558
You deserve it after all
the sleep you've been getting.

262
00:11:10,963 --> 00:11:13,030
Maybe Barry will
change his mind.

263
00:11:13,031 --> 00:11:14,930
Hmm? Oh, I doubt it.

264
00:11:14,933 --> 00:11:16,666
I said some pretty
unprofessional things

265
00:11:16,669 --> 00:11:17,700
about his work.

266
00:11:17,703 --> 00:11:21,137
I may have even used
the “S” word.

267
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:24,708
Subpar?

268
00:11:24,709 --> 00:11:28,744
I'm not proud of it, Amy,
but I have a temper.

269
00:11:28,747 --> 00:11:31,147
Well, I suppose we could pick
a different date.

270
00:11:31,150 --> 00:11:33,315
Well, it took you nine months
to choose that one.

271
00:11:33,318 --> 00:11:35,084
I'll pick a different husband
first.

272
00:11:38,290 --> 00:11:42,092
Hey, I-I just, I wanted to
apologize about the Athenaeum.

273
00:11:42,094 --> 00:11:43,426
Why did you lie to me?

274
00:11:43,429 --> 00:11:44,560
I don't know.

275
00:11:44,563 --> 00:11:46,262
It just seemed funny at first

276
00:11:46,265 --> 00:11:49,632
and then the longer it went on,
funnier it got.

277
00:11:51,103 --> 00:11:53,770
So, yeah, I guess that's why.

278
00:11:55,074 --> 00:11:56,540
That's not much of an apology.

279
00:11:56,541 --> 00:11:58,374
Yeah, because he's not
really sorry.

280
00:11:58,377 --> 00:12:01,210
Obviously, he wanted a place
to go where I wouldn't be

281
00:12:01,213 --> 00:12:05,382
and apparently all of outside
wasn't enough for him.

282
00:12:05,383 --> 00:12:06,949
Come on. I-I do feel bad.

283
00:12:06,951 --> 00:12:08,786
Why? Did your best friend
hurt your feelings?

284
00:12:08,810 --> 00:12:10,153
Come on— Sheldon.

285
00:12:10,155 --> 00:12:12,189
Look, I only have time to deal
with one jerk right now

286
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:14,391
and that's Barry Kripke.
What?

287
00:12:14,392 --> 00:12:16,626
He has the Athenaeum booked
for our wedding date

288
00:12:16,627 --> 00:12:17,960
and he won't give it up.

289
00:12:17,963 --> 00:12:20,629
Yeah, so if you could just
please leave before I get angry

290
00:12:20,632 --> 00:12:23,300
and say something I will regret
about your face, your height,

291
00:12:23,301 --> 00:12:26,169
your personal hygiene or
the fact that your science,

292
00:12:26,170 --> 00:12:29,506
while serviceable,
lacks panache.

293
00:12:29,507 --> 00:12:31,440
That's actually
one of the nicest things

294
00:12:31,443 --> 00:12:33,410
you've ever said about my work.

295
00:12:33,411 --> 00:12:35,177
And now I regret it.

296
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:36,780
Good-bye.

297
00:12:39,350 --> 00:12:42,685
Hey. There you are.

298
00:12:42,688 --> 00:12:44,286
Yeah, I just wanted to stop in
and see my office

299
00:12:44,289 --> 00:12:45,589
before we went to lunch.

300
00:12:45,590 --> 00:12:47,757
Just a few more weeks,
you'll be back full-time, huh?

301
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,225
Yeah.

302
00:12:49,228 --> 00:12:52,161
Uh-oh. That wasn't
a happy “yeah.”

303
00:12:52,164 --> 00:12:55,732
That was a “Hey, Leonard, do you
want to go to the gym?” yeah.

304
00:12:55,733 --> 00:12:58,368
I've just been thinking
that maybe I'd rather

305
00:12:58,369 --> 00:13:00,837
stay home with the kids
and be a mom.

306
00:13:00,839 --> 00:13:02,839
Wow. That's big.

307
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:04,040
I know.

308
00:13:04,041 --> 00:13:06,175
Dr. Rostenkowski.

309
00:13:06,177 --> 00:13:07,477
I'm sorry, I didn't
know you were back.

310
00:13:07,478 --> 00:13:08,778
Oh, I'm not.

311
00:13:08,781 --> 00:13:10,146
I just came to meet Penny
for lunch.

312
00:13:10,148 --> 00:13:12,581
Is there anything I can get you?
Coffee? Water?

313
00:13:12,584 --> 00:13:15,285
No, I think we're just gonna...
Coffee sounds good.

314
00:13:15,286 --> 00:13:17,253
Cold brew, almond milk?
Perfect.

315
00:13:17,256 --> 00:13:20,824
Nothing-nothing for me.

316
00:13:20,825 --> 00:13:22,258
It's weird.

317
00:13:22,261 --> 00:13:24,294
I've been away so long
I don't miss any of this.

318
00:13:26,231 --> 00:13:27,763
Sorry to bother you.

319
00:13:27,766 --> 00:13:30,065
Dr. Lee heard you were here
and had a quick question.

320
00:13:30,068 --> 00:13:32,669
Fine. Put him on.

321
00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:34,371
Jerold, what's going on?

322
00:13:34,372 --> 00:13:36,872
Hope you're not screwing up
my research.

323
00:13:37,843 --> 00:13:39,408
You calling from a bike ride?

324
00:13:39,411 --> 00:13:41,377
'Cause you're backpedaling hard.

325
00:13:41,379 --> 00:13:43,512
All right, fine. E-mail it over.
I'll take a look.

326
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:49,685
Oh, sorry. Where were we?

327
00:13:49,688 --> 00:13:51,488
Love your kids.
Don't miss your job.

328
00:13:51,489 --> 00:13:53,390
Right, right.

329
00:13:54,258 --> 00:13:55,691
There's nothing in the world

330
00:13:55,694 --> 00:13:57,227
like holding your sleeping baby,

331
00:13:57,228 --> 00:13:59,429
knowing you make him
feel safe and then—

332
00:13:59,430 --> 00:14:01,831
Oh, good, you got
the little cookies I like.

333
00:14:01,834 --> 00:14:03,433
I wouldn't mind a cookie.

334
00:14:03,435 --> 00:14:05,468
And he's gone. Okay.

335
00:14:13,878 --> 00:14:15,244
Hey, Kripke.

336
00:14:15,247 --> 00:14:18,448
Hello, Hofstadter.

337
00:14:18,449 --> 00:14:19,782
Why are you cleaning that out
yourself?

338
00:14:19,785 --> 00:14:21,218
Don't you have grad students?

339
00:14:21,219 --> 00:14:25,321
Come on, I can't make my grad
students do every dirty job

340
00:14:25,324 --> 00:14:29,358
or so I've been told in writing
by the head of Human Resources.

341
00:14:29,361 --> 00:14:33,329
Fair enough.
Uh, so, look,

342
00:14:33,331 --> 00:14:35,866
I'm here to ask you
to give Sheldon and Amy

343
00:14:35,868 --> 00:14:37,800
the Athenaeum for their wedding.

344
00:14:39,570 --> 00:14:42,372
Why would I do that?

345
00:14:42,373 --> 00:14:47,310
Because deep down, Barry,
you're a really good guy.

346
00:14:47,311 --> 00:14:50,412
But am I?

347
00:14:52,251 --> 00:14:55,285
Fine. What's it gonna take?

348
00:14:59,523 --> 00:15:02,324
Barry, I've come
to ask one more...

349
00:15:02,326 --> 00:15:04,060
Leonard?

350
00:15:04,061 --> 00:15:05,896
Wh-Why are you
doing that?

351
00:15:05,897 --> 00:15:09,900
Because deep down
Barry is not a good guy.

352
00:15:09,901 --> 00:15:14,070
He's making you clean out
barrels of irradiated grease?

353
00:15:14,071 --> 00:15:16,839
Yeah.

354
00:15:16,842 --> 00:15:18,742
I made a deal with him

355
00:15:18,743 --> 00:15:21,544
to get you the Athenaeum
for your wedding.

356
00:15:21,545 --> 00:15:24,180
Why would you do that?

357
00:15:24,181 --> 00:15:27,950
Because I was a jerk
for lying to you before

358
00:15:27,953 --> 00:15:29,652
and besides,
you're my best friend.

359
00:15:29,655 --> 00:15:31,521
I want you to have
the wedding of your dreams.

360
00:15:31,522 --> 00:15:34,757
On Mars?

361
00:15:37,528 --> 00:15:40,863
Okay, I want Amy to have
the wedding of her dreams.

362
00:15:40,866 --> 00:15:43,465
Well, thank you.

363
00:15:43,468 --> 00:15:45,068
But I don't want
you to do this.

364
00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:46,036
No, it's okay.

365
00:15:46,037 --> 00:15:47,369
No, it's not.

366
00:15:47,372 --> 00:15:49,606
We're not going
to let Barry win.

367
00:15:49,608 --> 00:15:50,906
Well, what are we going to do?

368
00:15:50,908 --> 00:15:54,109
We have a combined IQ of 360.

369
00:15:54,112 --> 00:15:57,680
Perhaps more if that radiation
gave you a super brain.

370
00:15:57,683 --> 00:16:00,316
You know what? You're right.

371
00:16:00,319 --> 00:16:03,920
If we work together we could
totally outsmart Barry Kripke.

372
00:16:12,097 --> 00:16:14,997
Leonard, my nose itches.
What do I do?

373
00:16:17,268 --> 00:16:19,435
Oh, boy.

374
00:16:19,438 --> 00:16:21,403
I really
passed out hard.

375
00:16:21,406 --> 00:16:22,571
Yeah, tell me about it.

376
00:16:22,574 --> 00:16:24,373
The kids could've screamed
bloody murder

377
00:16:24,376 --> 00:16:26,575
and you wouldn't have woken up.

378
00:16:26,578 --> 00:16:28,978
Which I know because they did.

379
00:16:28,981 --> 00:16:31,481
I'm sorry.

380
00:16:31,483 --> 00:16:33,616
Why did I think I could
do this on my own?

381
00:16:33,618 --> 00:16:35,919
Hey, don't beat yourself up.

382
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:37,286
Parenting is hard.

383
00:16:37,289 --> 00:16:39,622
Like, I've seen
and smelled things today

384
00:16:39,623 --> 00:16:42,191
that I cannot unsee or unsmell.

385
00:16:42,194 --> 00:16:45,328
Thanks for covering for me.

386
00:16:45,329 --> 00:16:46,662
No, I mean he only drinks milk.

387
00:16:46,665 --> 00:16:50,132
Like, where are the colors
coming from?

388
00:16:52,003 --> 00:16:53,869
What time is it?

389
00:16:53,872 --> 00:16:56,039
Uh, it's almost 6:00.

390
00:16:56,041 --> 00:16:57,473
Okay. Bernadette's
gonna be home soon.

391
00:16:57,475 --> 00:16:58,742
We got to divide
and conquer.

392
00:16:58,743 --> 00:17:00,477
I'll make dinner.
You watch the kids.

393
00:17:00,478 --> 00:17:01,511
Uh, kids are asleep.

394
00:17:01,512 --> 00:17:03,979
Great, then you
make dinner.

395
00:17:06,318 --> 00:17:08,184
Hey, good news, Amy.

396
00:17:08,185 --> 00:17:09,819
We got the Athenaeum.

397
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:11,054
Oh, my gosh.

398
00:17:11,055 --> 00:17:13,156
That's amazing.

399
00:17:13,157 --> 00:17:15,191
How'd you get Barry
to change his mind?

400
00:17:15,193 --> 00:17:16,960
Well, I couldn't have done it
without Leonard.

401
00:17:16,962 --> 00:17:18,427
Boy, you should've seen us
in there.

402
00:17:18,429 --> 00:17:20,829
We were like
Batman and Robin.

403
00:17:20,831 --> 00:17:23,465
Why do I have to be Robin?

404
00:17:23,467 --> 00:17:25,568
If you have to ask,
you're Robin.

405
00:17:26,871 --> 00:17:28,605
What happened?

406
00:17:28,607 --> 00:17:30,839
Well, we scrubbed out some
barrels of irradiated grease,

407
00:17:30,841 --> 00:17:32,375
rinsed off in
a safety shower

408
00:17:32,377 --> 00:17:35,544
and then told Barry
Kripke what is what.

409
00:17:35,547 --> 00:17:37,179
And he just gave in?

410
00:17:37,182 --> 00:17:39,249
Well, we agreed to invite him
to the wedding.

411
00:17:39,251 --> 00:17:41,216
Okay. No problem.

412
00:17:41,218 --> 00:17:42,718
- And he gets to bring a date.
- Yeah.

413
00:17:42,721 --> 00:17:44,053
Well, that's reasonable.

414
00:17:44,056 --> 00:17:47,890
A-And if she charges by
the hour, we have to cover it.

415
00:17:49,727 --> 00:17:51,593
What else did you agree to?

416
00:17:51,596 --> 00:17:56,398
Well, um, you know how Barry
has the voice of an angel?

417
00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:00,235
He is not singing
at our wedding.

418
00:18:00,237 --> 00:18:02,571
He only
wants to sing “Volare.”

419
00:18:02,573 --> 00:18:05,140
Oh, “Volare”.

420
00:18:06,445 --> 00:18:08,477
That's what he was saying.

421
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:10,946
Boy, I didn't, I
did not get that.

422
00:18:10,948 --> 00:18:13,983
Guys, I appreciate
everything you did,

423
00:18:13,984 --> 00:18:16,519
but we can find another location
that's just as good.

424
00:18:16,521 --> 00:18:19,521
Maybe the Japanese garden
or the planetarium.

425
00:18:19,523 --> 00:18:21,657
The planetarium.

426
00:18:21,659 --> 00:18:23,092
I hadn't thought about that.

427
00:18:23,095 --> 00:18:24,461
That's even better.

428
00:18:24,463 --> 00:18:25,762
Wait, what?

429
00:18:25,763 --> 00:18:27,629
I scrubbed sludge for you.

430
00:18:27,631 --> 00:18:31,434
I may be
slightly radioactive.

431
00:18:31,435 --> 00:18:33,235
Oh, you're exaggerating.

432
00:18:33,237 --> 00:18:34,904
Don't let him touch
the silverware.

433
00:18:40,318 --> 00:18:42,784
Why is Raj asleep
on our couch?

434
00:18:42,787 --> 00:18:45,120
Oh. I needed some help
so he came by,

435
00:18:45,122 --> 00:18:46,688
played with the kids,
read them some stories,

436
00:18:46,691 --> 00:18:49,591
put them down for their nap
and made dinner.

437
00:18:49,593 --> 00:18:51,394
What'd you do?

438
00:18:51,396 --> 00:18:53,695
Ate dinner.

439
00:18:53,697 --> 00:18:56,999
Okay, look, I don't
think I'm cut out

440
00:18:57,001 --> 00:18:58,267
to be a stay-at-home dad.

441
00:18:58,269 --> 00:19:01,671
And since you want to,
you should stay home.

442
00:19:01,673 --> 00:19:03,939
I-I do definitely want to,

443
00:19:03,942 --> 00:19:07,009
but I know how much this means
to you and it was just one day.

444
00:19:07,011 --> 00:19:09,645
So, don't give up.

445
00:19:09,646 --> 00:19:12,314
You don't want to
stay home, either.

446
00:19:12,317 --> 00:19:13,983
Do you?

447
00:19:13,984 --> 00:19:15,350
When I went by the office
they gave me

448
00:19:15,352 --> 00:19:17,787
coffee and cookies
and no one peed on me.

449
00:19:19,223 --> 00:19:22,023
I miss that so much.

450
00:19:22,025 --> 00:19:26,862
Well, I love the kids,
but I also love my job.

451
00:19:26,865 --> 00:19:29,298
And sleep.

452
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:32,335
I know. I took a two-hour nap
on the couch in my office.

453
00:19:32,337 --> 00:19:35,437
I took a three-hour nap on
the floor in the living room.

454
00:19:35,439 --> 00:19:37,373
How do you feel now?

455
00:19:37,375 --> 00:19:40,810
Honestly? Still tired.

456
00:19:40,811 --> 00:19:42,477
Me, too.

457
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:44,146
I love you.

458
00:19:44,148 --> 00:19:45,514
I love you, too.

459
00:19:45,517 --> 00:19:46,983
And we'll figure this all out.

460
00:19:46,984 --> 00:19:50,352
Yeah.

461
00:19:50,355 --> 00:19:52,021
Everyone's asleep.

462
00:19:52,022 --> 00:19:55,691
You want to head
upstairs and...

463
00:19:55,693 --> 00:19:57,493
you know.

464
00:19:57,494 --> 00:20:00,596
Let's just do it right here.

465
00:20:00,598 --> 00:20:02,531
Oh, oh, I like
the way you think.

466
