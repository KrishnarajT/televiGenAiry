- He did.

He was cremated, and his remains were put
in a baking-soda volcano.

- Me too. I grew up watching his show.

- Not yet, and it won't be easy.

She's not a scientist.

Well, then explain to me
why she has chemistry with literally everyone.

Professor Proton touched me as a child...

and touch as many children as possible.

Did you know you could calculate the mass
of an electron using household items?

It's true. All you'll need is a pencil,
some paper, dry ice, rubbing alcohol...

of 50-micron-thick cobalt-60 wire.

If she's hungry, I'll give her a bottle...
