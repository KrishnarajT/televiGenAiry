1
00:00:11,892 --> 00:00:14,161
Howie? Howie, wake up.

2
00:00:14,193 --> 00:00:15,295
It's time.

3
00:00:15,328 --> 00:00:17,197
Did your water break?

4
00:00:17,229 --> 00:00:18,498
No.

5
00:00:18,531 --> 00:00:20,400
Are you feeling
any contractions?

6
00:00:20,432 --> 00:00:22,301
No.

7
00:00:22,334 --> 00:00:24,104
Wait. Well,
where are you going?

8
00:00:24,136 --> 00:00:25,205
To the hospital.

9
00:00:25,237 --> 00:00:29,208
Today's my due date,
and this crap needs to end now.

10
00:00:30,276 --> 00:00:33,880
Honey, babies don't
always come on their due date.

11
00:00:33,914 --> 00:00:36,148
Halley was two weeks late.

12
00:00:37,184 --> 00:00:39,386
But this baby's a boy.

13
00:00:39,419 --> 00:00:41,487
They don't take
as long to get ready.

14
00:00:42,923 --> 00:00:44,256
What are you doing?

15
00:00:44,291 --> 00:00:46,893
I'm making the situation
better with humor.

16
00:00:46,926 --> 00:00:49,228
Are you?

17
00:00:50,329 --> 00:00:53,300
Would you rather me
make it better with magic?

18
00:00:53,332 --> 00:00:56,002
Go back to sleep.
Ta-da!

19
00:01:04,310 --> 00:01:06,478
You know, I hear
that sex can induce labor.

20
00:01:06,513 --> 00:01:08,514
Anything for my family.

21
00:01:37,576 --> 00:01:40,246
I believe today is
Bernadette's due date.

22
00:01:41,581 --> 00:01:42,615
How do you know that?

23
00:01:42,648 --> 00:01:46,252
Easy. 40 weeks from the date
of her last period.

24
00:01:48,055 --> 00:01:50,189
And why do you know that?

25
00:01:50,222 --> 00:01:53,159
Well, excuse me for taking
an interest in people.

26
00:01:54,526 --> 00:01:56,329
So, any day now.

27
00:01:56,362 --> 00:01:57,530
I don't know.

28
00:01:57,563 --> 00:01:58,664
We went to the doctor
this morning,

29
00:01:58,698 --> 00:02:01,267
and she said it could still
be another week or two.

30
00:02:01,301 --> 00:02:03,236
How's Bernadette holding up?

31
00:02:03,269 --> 00:02:05,237
It's pretty rough.

32
00:02:05,272 --> 00:02:07,906
She's having a hard time.

33
00:02:09,542 --> 00:02:11,243
Why are you smiling?

34
00:02:11,277 --> 00:02:13,612
I had sex twice
last night.

35
00:02:13,645 --> 00:02:15,647
That's not fair!
She's on bed rest.

36
00:02:15,681 --> 00:02:17,450
She can't run away.

37
00:02:17,484 --> 00:02:19,485
It was her idea.

38
00:02:19,519 --> 00:02:21,454
She read that it
can start labor.

39
00:02:21,487 --> 00:02:22,722
Is that true?

40
00:02:22,754 --> 00:02:24,324
Well, I would have Googled it,

41
00:02:24,356 --> 00:02:26,526
but I was busy
taking my pants off.

42
00:02:28,294 --> 00:02:31,063
Not to brag, but Amy's last birthday

43
00:02:31,098 --> 00:02:33,233
brought my coital tally
up to four.

44
00:02:34,266 --> 00:02:36,503
Whatever you're doing,
it's not bragging.

45
00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:39,306
Hey, guys.
Hey. Hey.

46
00:02:39,338 --> 00:02:40,539
Hey.
Hey, I was just

47
00:02:40,573 --> 00:02:41,608
talking about you.

48
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:42,741
Should I ask?

49
00:02:42,775 --> 00:02:45,111
You should not.

50
00:02:45,145 --> 00:02:47,447
I'm trying to get
our grant proposal together.

51
00:02:47,479 --> 00:02:49,049
Any chance you've finished up
those mechanical drawings?

52
00:02:49,081 --> 00:02:50,682
Sorry.
I was gonna do it last night,

53
00:02:50,717 --> 00:02:52,152
but I got kind of busy.

54
00:02:52,185 --> 00:02:54,054
You did.

55
00:02:55,587 --> 00:02:57,390
What are they talking about?

56
00:02:57,424 --> 00:02:58,624
I'll give
you a hint.

57
00:02:58,657 --> 00:03:01,593
It's something
that we have done four times.

58
00:03:01,628 --> 00:03:03,462
Watched La La Land?

59
00:03:03,496 --> 00:03:06,133
What? No. No.

60
00:03:06,165 --> 00:03:08,467
I've not watched
La La Land four times.

61
00:03:08,501 --> 00:03:10,302
If you find the
soundtrack on my phone,

62
00:03:10,336 --> 00:03:12,639
that's just 'cause
our iTunes accounts are linked.

63
00:03:14,174 --> 00:03:15,574
Looks like I might have
a little more time

64
00:03:15,608 --> 00:03:17,009
before the baby gets here,

65
00:03:17,044 --> 00:03:18,777
so why don't we just stay late
and get it done?

66
00:03:18,811 --> 00:03:21,247
Well, I don't want you
to leave Bernadette alone.

67
00:03:21,281 --> 00:03:23,150
We can hang out and keep her company.

68
00:03:23,182 --> 00:03:25,418
Absolutely.
See, see. Look at my Netflix queue.

69
00:03:25,451 --> 00:03:26,318
There's two documentaries

70
00:03:26,353 --> 00:03:28,020
and the movie
Friends with Benefits,

71
00:03:28,055 --> 00:03:29,521
which I thought
was a documentary

72
00:03:29,556 --> 00:03:31,691
about employer
health care plans.

73
00:03:33,825 --> 00:03:36,329
Hey, Bernie, it's me.

74
00:03:36,362 --> 00:03:38,230
I let myself in.

75
00:03:38,265 --> 00:03:40,667
Hey.

76
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:41,700
What are you doing?

77
00:03:41,734 --> 00:03:44,170
I thought you were supposed
to be on bed rest.

78
00:03:44,204 --> 00:03:45,604
That's done,
but I've been on stair rest

79
00:03:45,638 --> 00:03:47,539
for the last 45 minutes.

80
00:03:47,573 --> 00:03:49,408
Here, let me help you.

81
00:03:49,442 --> 00:03:51,544
If you really want to help,
put on a rubber glove,

82
00:03:51,578 --> 00:03:54,114
reach on up there
and start pulling.

83
00:03:54,146 --> 00:03:56,282
I know you're joking,
but I grew up on a farm.

84
00:03:56,316 --> 00:03:57,383
I'll do it.

85
00:03:57,417 --> 00:03:59,686
I just want this to be over.

86
00:03:59,718 --> 00:04:01,820
You know, when
my yoga instructor was pregnant,

87
00:04:01,854 --> 00:04:03,689
she told me
there are tons of poses

88
00:04:03,723 --> 00:04:05,292
that put her right into labor.

89
00:04:05,324 --> 00:04:06,526
I'll try,

90
00:04:06,558 --> 00:04:09,695
but I feel like bendy poses
are what got me into this mess.

91
00:04:11,497 --> 00:04:14,633
Okay, we're gonna start with
some nice breathing exercises.

92
00:04:16,703 --> 00:04:21,140
Sorry. I can't think of anything
except how flat your belly is.

93
00:04:21,174 --> 00:04:22,775
Thank you.

94
00:04:22,808 --> 00:04:25,578
Go put on some more clothes,
you bitch.

95
00:04:30,782 --> 00:04:33,785
Okay, we go down...

96
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:36,054
and back up.

97
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:41,594
And back up!

98
00:04:41,628 --> 00:04:43,662
Hearing you is not the problem.

99
00:04:46,633 --> 00:04:48,234
Put that phone away!

100
00:04:48,267 --> 00:04:49,368
Smile.

101
00:04:51,570 --> 00:04:54,140
I'm telling you,
there's an acupressure point

102
00:04:54,174 --> 00:04:57,176
right above your ankle
that can induce contractions.

103
00:04:57,210 --> 00:04:58,777
All right, but
just a warning.

104
00:04:58,811 --> 00:05:00,546
My feet are a little swollen.

105
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:01,780
Please, Bernadette.

106
00:05:01,813 --> 00:05:04,183
I'm sure this... okay.

107
00:05:05,652 --> 00:05:06,585
What?

108
00:05:06,618 --> 00:05:10,157
Nothing. Your ankles look fine,
and not at all

109
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:12,691
like I just popped open
a can of crescent rolls.

110
00:05:14,794 --> 00:05:17,563
My mother believes that if
you're not prepared mentally,

111
00:05:17,597 --> 00:05:19,498
it can delay your body
from going into labor.

112
00:05:19,532 --> 00:05:21,833
So what are you trying to say?
It's my fault?

113
00:05:23,602 --> 00:05:26,138
Raj is crazy.

114
00:05:26,173 --> 00:05:28,140
Your ankles aren't that gross.

115
00:05:33,179 --> 00:05:35,147
Hello.

116
00:05:35,181 --> 00:05:38,217
Let me guess. You're here to
try to get me to go into labor.

117
00:05:38,251 --> 00:05:41,188
Please. I'm disgusted
when people sneeze,

118
00:05:41,221 --> 00:05:43,590
and that's just stuff
coming out of their nose.

119
00:05:43,623 --> 00:05:45,657
No.

120
00:05:45,691 --> 00:05:48,695
I am here to sit with you
and keep you company.

121
00:05:48,727 --> 00:05:50,229
That's nice.

122
00:05:50,263 --> 00:05:53,166
By playing
the most complicated board game

123
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:57,503
ever invented:
Campaign for North Africa.

124
00:05:57,537 --> 00:05:58,705
I bought it off eBay.

125
00:05:58,737 --> 00:06:02,308
It smells a little like chili,
but all the pieces are there.

126
00:06:03,943 --> 00:06:05,777
Come on, baby.

127
00:06:05,811 --> 00:06:08,715
Get out here right now
and I'll buy you a pony.

128
00:06:11,650 --> 00:06:14,520
Are there any engineers
on the grant committee?

129
00:06:14,554 --> 00:06:15,955
I don't know. Why?

130
00:06:15,988 --> 00:06:17,590
I didn't have time to figure out

131
00:06:17,623 --> 00:06:18,857
the three-input
hydraulic manifold,

132
00:06:18,890 --> 00:06:21,260
so this diagram is really just
a flux capacitor

133
00:06:21,294 --> 00:06:22,761
from Back to the Future.

134
00:06:22,794 --> 00:06:26,433
I'm sorry this is
on such short notice.

135
00:06:26,465 --> 00:06:28,700
Hey, I just wish I could be
there when you present it.

136
00:06:28,734 --> 00:06:30,369
That's okay.

137
00:06:30,402 --> 00:06:32,572
It's more important that
you spend time with Michael.

138
00:06:32,604 --> 00:06:34,606
Who's Michael?

139
00:06:35,741 --> 00:06:36,808
Your son?

140
00:06:36,842 --> 00:06:38,510
No, it's not.

141
00:06:38,544 --> 00:06:40,612
My son doesn't have a name yet.

142
00:06:44,683 --> 00:06:46,585
Okay, well, then,
Bernadette's son.

143
00:06:48,621 --> 00:06:49,989
I can't believe her.

144
00:06:50,022 --> 00:06:53,392
She knows I don't want
to name the baby after her dad.

145
00:06:53,426 --> 00:06:55,527
What did you want to name him?
I don't know.

146
00:06:55,561 --> 00:06:57,729
We were gonna wait until
we saw what he looked like.

147
00:06:57,763 --> 00:06:59,731
Well, it's a baby.

148
00:06:59,765 --> 00:07:01,534
Her dad's
a wrinkly bald man.

149
00:07:01,568 --> 00:07:03,535
That wasn't gonna
break your way.

150
00:07:12,611 --> 00:07:14,847
Come on!

151
00:07:16,816 --> 00:07:20,486
Welcome to the next five to
eight weeks of your life.

152
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:22,921
Sheldon, I said
I didn't want to play your game.

153
00:07:22,955 --> 00:07:25,592
Well, then don't
think of it as a game.

154
00:07:25,625 --> 00:07:26,726
Think of it

155
00:07:26,758 --> 00:07:28,727
as a source of information

156
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:32,498
about one of the lesser known
campaigns of World War II.

157
00:07:32,532 --> 00:07:34,000
You're right.

158
00:07:34,032 --> 00:07:36,034
That's so much better.

159
00:07:36,068 --> 00:07:38,270
I know, right?

160
00:07:38,304 --> 00:07:41,373
Okay, first, we need to roll
to determine the weather.

161
00:07:41,407 --> 00:07:44,376
It's a desert.
Isn't it gonna be hot?

162
00:07:59,025 --> 00:08:01,493
Yes.

163
00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:07,667
Michael? Really, you think
we're naming him Michael?

164
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:09,068
Not now, Howard.

165
00:08:09,101 --> 00:08:12,405
I'm in the middle of a game.

166
00:08:12,438 --> 00:08:15,474
You wish. You are hundreds
of hours away from the middle.

167
00:08:23,114 --> 00:08:26,719
I can't believe you're trying
to hijack our son's name.

168
00:08:26,753 --> 00:08:29,356
Bernie?

169
00:08:30,556 --> 00:08:33,559
This is as fast as I move! Calm down!

170
00:08:41,433 --> 00:08:43,403
So you're just gonna
name him Michael?

171
00:08:43,435 --> 00:08:45,070
Were you even
gonna tell me?

172
00:08:45,103 --> 00:08:46,639
I told you.

173
00:08:46,673 --> 00:08:48,006
When?

174
00:08:48,039 --> 00:08:50,876
Right. That was Amy.

175
00:08:52,411 --> 00:08:54,914
What's wrong with Michael?
It's my dad's name.

176
00:08:54,947 --> 00:08:58,385
I don't want to name our son
after your father.

177
00:09:01,821 --> 00:09:04,524
I didn't want to say
this, but he's dying.

178
00:09:04,557 --> 00:09:06,893
He is?

179
00:09:06,925 --> 00:09:10,362
Eventually. I mean, you
see the way the man eats.

180
00:09:11,597 --> 00:09:13,500
Okay, is this the hormones,

181
00:09:13,533 --> 00:09:15,802
or have you always been
a lunatic?

182
00:09:15,834 --> 00:09:18,371
I don't even know anymore.

183
00:09:20,139 --> 00:09:22,608
Bernie, this is our kid's name.

184
00:09:22,641 --> 00:09:25,845
I think we should both agree.

185
00:09:25,877 --> 00:09:27,947
You're right. We
both made this baby.

186
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:29,948
Thank you.

187
00:09:29,981 --> 00:09:31,851
And I carried it, had to
stay in bed for four months,

188
00:09:31,884 --> 00:09:33,453
sacrificed my body and my job,

189
00:09:33,486 --> 00:09:35,387
and soon it's gonna
burst its way out of me

190
00:09:35,422 --> 00:09:37,924
like the Kool-Aid Man.

191
00:09:37,957 --> 00:09:40,693
Exactly. Fifty-fifty.

192
00:09:43,962 --> 00:09:46,598
I think I got Bernadette in trouble.

193
00:09:46,632 --> 00:09:47,600
Maybe we should go.

194
00:09:47,634 --> 00:09:48,668
I-I can't.

195
00:09:48,701 --> 00:09:50,937
She and I are playing
Campaign for North Africa.

196
00:09:52,170 --> 00:09:55,106
She doesn't want to play that.

197
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:57,644
Neither did the Egyptians,
but that didn't stop Rommel.

198
00:09:58,845 --> 00:10:01,813
Hey! I brought Chinese.

199
00:10:01,847 --> 00:10:03,850
And I brought Indian.

200
00:10:05,684 --> 00:10:07,019
What are you guys
doing here?

201
00:10:07,053 --> 00:10:07,886
Sheldon texted and said

202
00:10:07,919 --> 00:10:09,755
Bernadette wanted us all
to come over.

203
00:10:12,924 --> 00:10:16,596
The game's best with
five to ten players.

204
00:10:18,798 --> 00:10:21,833
Okay, if it's not Michael, then
what do you want to name him?

205
00:10:21,867 --> 00:10:24,871
Harry, like Potter or Houdini.

206
00:10:26,606 --> 00:10:27,874
It doesn't bother you that
I have an old boyfriend

207
00:10:27,906 --> 00:10:28,975
named Harry?

208
00:10:30,009 --> 00:10:32,178
Okay.

209
00:10:32,211 --> 00:10:35,448
How 'bout Al or Max or...

210
00:10:35,481 --> 00:10:37,616
Ted or Kevin?

211
00:10:37,650 --> 00:10:38,918
Same answer.

212
00:10:40,086 --> 00:10:41,721
Hey, Bernadette,
it's your turn.

213
00:10:41,754 --> 00:10:43,054
Penny's air force

214
00:10:43,088 --> 00:10:46,458
is strafing
your supply line in Tobruk.

215
00:10:46,492 --> 00:10:47,794
We're kind of busy.

216
00:10:47,827 --> 00:10:50,530
'Kay.
But you're being pretty rude.

217
00:10:50,563 --> 00:10:52,731
Everyone did come over
to play this game with you.

218
00:10:55,735 --> 00:10:58,804
You know, I always thought
Christian was a nice name.

219
00:10:58,837 --> 00:10:59,639
I don't know.

220
00:10:59,672 --> 00:11:03,476
Sounds a little
too uncircumcised.

221
00:11:04,611 --> 00:11:05,845
Bernadette, it's your turn.

222
00:11:05,877 --> 00:11:06,645
What about Greg?

223
00:11:06,679 --> 00:11:08,179
All right,
I'll just roll for you.

224
00:11:09,881 --> 00:11:11,851
That is a good one!

225
00:11:11,884 --> 00:11:14,252
Your troops' morale rating
is pretty high.

226
00:11:14,285 --> 00:11:16,054
Now, Leonard, as the defender,

227
00:11:16,087 --> 00:11:18,089
we need to subtract
your morale rating

228
00:11:18,124 --> 00:11:19,692
from Bernadette's
to get a final

229
00:11:19,726 --> 00:11:21,260
adjusted morale rating
for the assault.

230
00:11:21,293 --> 00:11:24,262
And I will just check
the assault differential column.

231
00:11:24,295 --> 00:11:27,098
Who said war was hell?

232
00:11:28,568 --> 00:11:29,535
That's a rhetorical question.

233
00:11:29,568 --> 00:11:31,169
Sherman said it.

234
00:11:31,203 --> 00:11:32,170
What about Sherman?

235
00:11:32,203 --> 00:11:34,005
Like, Sherman Wolowitz.

236
00:11:34,039 --> 00:11:37,677
That's a kid who's gonna take
his mother to prom.

237
00:11:38,977 --> 00:11:40,880
Hey, Howard,
you did that, right?

238
00:11:41,813 --> 00:11:44,784
I didn't take her.
She chaperoned.

239
00:11:44,817 --> 00:11:47,754
We slow-danced once.

240
00:11:48,987 --> 00:11:50,890
What about Paul?

241
00:11:50,923 --> 00:11:53,893
Paul. Paul Wolowitz.

242
00:11:53,925 --> 00:11:55,193
I like it.

243
00:11:55,227 --> 00:11:56,996
Like "Koothra-paul-I."

244
00:11:58,798 --> 00:12:00,933
Okay, you ruined it.

245
00:12:02,134 --> 00:12:04,937
All right, that moves us on
to the tactical shipping phase.

246
00:12:04,971 --> 00:12:07,939
Penny, I believe,
as logistics commander, that's you.

247
00:12:07,973 --> 00:12:11,043
Okay. I surrender.

248
00:12:11,077 --> 00:12:12,845
Nice try, Penny.

249
00:12:12,879 --> 00:12:14,713
It takes more
than everybody not enjoying it

250
00:12:14,746 --> 00:12:16,882
to stop a game
with Sheldon Cooper.

251
00:12:18,317 --> 00:12:20,218
Sheldon, we're talking
about something important here.

252
00:12:20,251 --> 00:12:21,754
Fine.

253
00:12:21,788 --> 00:12:24,055
If you pick a baby name,
can we get back to playing?

254
00:12:24,089 --> 00:12:24,856
Sure.

255
00:12:24,890 --> 00:12:25,991
All right, here we go.

256
00:12:26,025 --> 00:12:27,559
Ranatanata.

257
00:12:29,962 --> 00:12:31,898
You can't name him Ranatanata.

258
00:12:31,930 --> 00:12:34,132
Right, it's a boy.
That'd be ridiculous.

259
00:12:35,101 --> 00:12:37,236
What about Ozymandias?

260
00:12:37,269 --> 00:12:41,573
Are you making these up
or having a stroke?

261
00:12:41,607 --> 00:12:44,810
Ozymandias is from a poem
by Percy Bysshe Shelley.

262
00:12:44,843 --> 00:12:46,813
Bysshe Wolowitz.

263
00:12:46,846 --> 00:12:48,246
Solved. Back to the game.

264
00:12:49,915 --> 00:12:51,751
Heyo! Sandstorm!

265
00:12:53,785 --> 00:12:56,155
Some people name their
kids after places.

266
00:12:56,188 --> 00:12:58,991
Like what, Walla
Walla Wolowitz?

267
00:13:01,193 --> 00:13:04,163
If you think that is better
than Ozymandias Wolowitz,

268
00:13:04,196 --> 00:13:05,765
then you have been breathing in
the poisonous gas

269
00:13:05,798 --> 00:13:07,766
that my troops
illegally dispersed.

270
00:13:09,135 --> 00:13:10,369
You okay?

271
00:13:10,401 --> 00:13:12,038
I think that was a contraction.

272
00:13:12,071 --> 00:13:14,973
Is it time? Do we need
to go to the hospital?

273
00:13:15,006 --> 00:13:16,041
No. We've been
through this before.

274
00:13:16,074 --> 00:13:18,144
My water
hasn't even broken yet.

275
00:13:18,177 --> 00:13:19,310
Never mind your water.

276
00:13:19,345 --> 00:13:21,813
Has your mucus plug popped out?

277
00:13:22,948 --> 00:13:23,915
No!

278
00:13:23,949 --> 00:13:24,951
You're right.

279
00:13:24,983 --> 00:13:26,986
We probably would've heard that.

280
00:13:27,019 --> 00:13:28,319
It's not a champagne cork.

281
00:13:28,353 --> 00:13:32,323
Although that
would be festive.

282
00:13:32,357 --> 00:13:33,826
You know what,
maybe we should go.

283
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:35,694
Did you have
another contraction?

284
00:13:35,727 --> 00:13:37,163
No. I'm just worried
that Sheldon's gonna say

285
00:13:37,195 --> 00:13:39,665
"mucus plug" again.

286
00:13:39,698 --> 00:13:43,169
And I'm worried
one's gonna hit me in the eye.

287
00:13:43,202 --> 00:13:44,303
Yep, it's time.

288
00:13:44,336 --> 00:13:45,404
Should we take
two cars?

289
00:13:45,437 --> 00:13:47,807
Actually, could you stay here and watch Halley?

290
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:49,942
That way we don't have to wait
for Bernadette's parents.

291
00:13:49,976 --> 00:13:51,143
You guys go.
We'll take care of her.

292
00:13:51,177 --> 00:13:53,145
You have nothing
to worry about.

293
00:13:53,179 --> 00:13:55,682
Well, not nothing.
There are U-boats approaching

294
00:13:55,714 --> 00:13:57,949
the Suez Canal.

295
00:13:57,983 --> 00:13:59,751
It's too late for us.
Go, go!

296
00:13:59,785 --> 00:14:01,788
Save yourselves!

297
00:14:02,855 --> 00:14:05,924
Suez
It's a big night for canals.

298
00:14:09,828 --> 00:14:11,798
How you feeling?

299
00:14:13,131 --> 00:14:16,736
But I am really excited
to meet our son.

300
00:14:16,769 --> 00:14:19,672
Me, too. I thought
I'd be super freaked out.

301
00:14:19,706 --> 00:14:22,875
But I'm ready for this.

302
00:14:22,909 --> 00:14:25,144
Well, not the part
where you're in labor

303
00:14:25,177 --> 00:14:28,113
and you squeeze my fingers
till they turn blue.

304
00:14:28,146 --> 00:14:29,881
I'm sorry.

305
00:14:29,915 --> 00:14:33,218
That must be
really painful for you.

306
00:14:34,252 --> 00:14:35,353
It is.

307
00:14:35,386 --> 00:14:36,856
I mean, last time, I...

308
00:14:36,889 --> 00:14:37,756
Okay,

309
00:14:37,789 --> 00:14:39,726
I see what you're doing.

310
00:14:42,895 --> 00:14:44,731
It's a big one.

311
00:14:44,764 --> 00:14:46,464
Just breathe.

312
00:14:46,497 --> 00:14:49,300
Okay.

313
00:14:49,334 --> 00:14:51,703
Okay, I'm good.

314
00:14:52,804 --> 00:14:55,842
I'm sorry I tried
to sneak the name past you.

315
00:14:55,875 --> 00:14:56,943
That's okay.

316
00:14:56,976 --> 00:15:00,880
I'm sorry I used up
so many good names in college.

317
00:15:02,481 --> 00:15:05,985
I was really competitive
with my roommate.

318
00:15:07,953 --> 00:15:09,922
Forget about it.

319
00:15:09,956 --> 00:15:11,890
Please.

320
00:15:13,826 --> 00:15:14,760
You know what,

321
00:15:14,794 --> 00:15:16,962
maybe we're putting
too much pressure on this.

322
00:15:16,996 --> 00:15:18,230
It doesn't matter
what we name him.

323
00:15:18,264 --> 00:15:19,866
He's gonna be amazing.

324
00:15:19,899 --> 00:15:21,400
You're right.

325
00:15:21,433 --> 00:15:24,937
This kid is part
you and part me.

326
00:15:24,971 --> 00:15:28,875
He's gonna be smart
and kind and funny.

327
00:15:28,908 --> 00:15:30,909
If he cracks five-foot-six,
it'll be a miracle.

328
00:15:33,511 --> 00:15:35,347
I've always liked
the name Elliott.

329
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:37,949
Sorry, can't have it.
That's my boy name.

330
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:39,284
I said it first.

331
00:15:39,318 --> 00:15:41,286
It's not like calling dibs.

332
00:15:41,319 --> 00:15:43,088
Yes, it is.
It's exactly like that.

333
00:15:43,121 --> 00:15:45,091
Dibs on Elliott.

334
00:15:45,124 --> 00:15:47,760
I-I'm just saying,
we might get there first.

335
00:15:47,794 --> 00:15:49,227
You only have sex
once a year.

336
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:50,962
I'll probably
have sex tonight.

337
00:15:52,364 --> 00:15:54,833
Fine, you can have Elliott.

338
00:15:55,967 --> 00:15:59,005
When did you pick out
our kids' names?

339
00:15:59,038 --> 00:16:00,972
Remember that day
you moved into the building?

340
00:16:01,006 --> 00:16:02,440
Yes.

341
00:16:03,809 --> 00:16:07,746
A non-creepy amount of time
after that.

342
00:16:08,914 --> 00:16:10,515
I like the name Elliott.

343
00:16:10,549 --> 00:16:12,284
That wasn't on my
list, but I like it.

344
00:16:12,318 --> 00:16:15,286
We've heard your names.
They're ridiculous.

345
00:16:15,321 --> 00:16:18,390
And I have a cousin named Dilip.

346
00:16:18,424 --> 00:16:20,992
Well, I wasn't going to give
them any of the good names.

347
00:16:21,026 --> 00:16:22,794
I'm saving those for us.

348
00:16:22,828 --> 00:16:25,932
Really? You've thought
about our kids?

349
00:16:25,964 --> 00:16:29,300
Of course. I think you and I
will have exceptional children.

350
00:16:31,002 --> 00:16:33,239
Well, I think so, too.

351
00:16:33,271 --> 00:16:35,040
How many kids do you guys want?

352
00:16:35,073 --> 00:16:37,275
Two.
15.

353
00:16:39,310 --> 00:16:40,813
What?
Don't worry.

354
00:16:40,847 --> 00:16:42,814
I don't expect you
to bear them all.

355
00:16:42,848 --> 00:16:45,852
I'm sure we can find a
suitable uterus to rent.

356
00:16:47,318 --> 00:16:49,956
No!

357
00:16:49,989 --> 00:16:52,058
We weren't thinking
about you.

358
00:16:52,091 --> 00:16:53,391
Of course not.

359
00:16:53,424 --> 00:16:54,592
I am going to
the kitchen.

360
00:16:54,626 --> 00:16:56,062
Can I get anybody anything?

361
00:16:56,095 --> 00:16:57,529
Penny, nice glass of milk

362
00:16:57,563 --> 00:16:59,832
and a multivitamin?

363
00:17:13,045 --> 00:17:14,881
Guys.

364
00:17:14,914 --> 00:17:16,347
Guys, wake up.

365
00:17:16,382 --> 00:17:17,116
Terrible news.

366
00:17:17,148 --> 00:17:18,517
Oh, my God.
What, what, what?

367
00:17:18,549 --> 00:17:19,518
Is it the baby?

368
00:17:19,550 --> 00:17:21,020
No. No, no, we miscalculated

369
00:17:21,052 --> 00:17:22,888
our unassigned
armor class units.

370
00:17:22,922 --> 00:17:24,155
We need to start over.

371
00:17:25,057 --> 00:17:25,892
What?

372
00:17:25,924 --> 00:17:27,259
No, no, no,
not from the beginning.

373
00:17:27,292 --> 00:17:28,994
Just from when the tanks
started moving.

374
00:17:29,028 --> 00:17:31,629
That was five hours ago.

375
00:17:31,663 --> 00:17:34,099
No.
No, that was two hours ago.

376
00:17:34,133 --> 00:17:36,903
It only feels like five.

377
00:17:36,935 --> 00:17:38,069
What time is it?

378
00:17:38,104 --> 00:17:39,370
It's almost 2:30.

379
00:17:39,405 --> 00:17:41,072
Don't you think
we should've heard something?

380
00:17:41,106 --> 00:17:42,441
I'm sure they're fine.

381
00:17:42,473 --> 00:17:44,109
I'm calling them.

382
00:17:47,046 --> 00:17:48,013
Hey!

383
00:17:48,047 --> 00:17:48,947
Hey, everything okay?

384
00:17:48,981 --> 00:17:52,283
The baby was born
about an hour ago.

385
00:17:52,318 --> 00:17:55,287
Dude, why didn't
you call me?

386
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:58,223
The only way I would
see my son for the first time

387
00:17:58,257 --> 00:18:00,291
and immediately think
"I need to call Raj"

388
00:18:00,326 --> 00:18:02,627
is if he came out brown.

389
00:18:04,096 --> 00:18:06,565
You know, it can take some time
for pigment to form.

390
00:18:06,597 --> 00:18:08,166
You're still not
out of the woods.

391
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:11,302
Congratulations!
Hey, what'd you name him?

392
00:18:11,337 --> 00:18:13,039
Neil Michael.

393
00:18:13,071 --> 00:18:15,007
Neil for Armstrong,

394
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:16,008
Gaiman, and Diamond.

395
00:18:16,041 --> 00:18:20,112
Michael because Bernie
had to get six stitches.

396
00:18:20,145 --> 00:18:22,280
Neil... that's cute.

397
00:18:22,314 --> 00:18:24,083
But we're calling him Michael!

398
00:18:24,116 --> 00:18:25,952
I'm not gonna fight her.

399
00:18:25,984 --> 00:18:28,686
That kid's head was the size
of a cantaloupe.
