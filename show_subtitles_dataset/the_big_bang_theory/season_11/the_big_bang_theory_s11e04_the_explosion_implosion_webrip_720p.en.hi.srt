- Absolutely.

Is Halley hoping
for a little brother or a little sister?

Well, she's 9 months old. So unless it
jingles or is in my bra, she doesn't care.

The one thing I thought I could
do with my son. I can't even do that right.

174

If you wanna see it again, I got it on video.

175
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,852
It's pretty cool in slow motion.

176
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:24,021
Thank you for your support.

177
00:10:24,188 --> 00:10:26,232
- You're welcome.
- I was being sarcastic.

178
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:27,733
How dare you?

179
00:10:30,111 --> 00:10:32,279
Sheldon, what am I gonna do?

180
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:36,325
What do I know about raising a boy?

181
00:10:37,410 --> 00:10:40,037
What do you know about raising a girl?

00:10:41,622 --> 00:10:42,873
Oh, my God.

You're right.

Well, I don't know
if that was sarcasm or not.

My mother's texting you?

193

Yeah, we've been talking a lot lately.

00:11:20,161 --> 00:11:21,954
Why?

195
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:25,916
Is she sick of talking
to the Magic Mirror on the wall?

196
00:11:27,042 --> 00:11:30,004
No, I thinks she's lonely.
She's been reaching out.

00:11:30,921 --> 00:11:35,009
Okay, just be careful.
You think you're getting close to her.

No, it's not like that.

You know, she's been
opening up about her life.

She's been really supportive about mine.

- Really?
- Yeah.

204
00:11:50,441 --> 00:11:53,527
I've been telling her about my job.
She said she was proud of me.

Well, that's great.

206
00:11:58,824 --> 00:12:00,785
She never told me she was proud of me.

207

Even when I stayed dry for a whole month.

208
00:12:07,333 --> 00:12:09,293
Do you not want me
to be friends with your mom?

209
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:11,003
Well, let's be clear.

210
00:12:11,170 --> 00:12:13,798
I married you to hurt her.

211
00:12:17,009 --> 00:12:18,761
You're kind of ruining it.

212
00:12:21,972 --> 00:12:24,683
Reason number 13 to feel good:

213
00:12:24,850 --> 00:12:26,769
As a launch, it was bad.

214
00:12:26,977 --> 00:12:29,688
But as an explosion, it was glorious.

215
00:12:31,357 --> 00:12:32,942
Reason 14:

216
00:12:33,108 --> 00:12:35,694
You still have all your fingers.

217
00:12:35,861 --> 00:12:38,739
And boys prefer a dad with fingers.

Thanks for trying, but you're not
gonna be able to cheer me up.

Well, how about this then?

You quit your whining before I give you

222
00:12:51,001 --> 00:12:54,421
Those are comforting words
my father would often say.

00:12:56,882 --> 00:12:59,677

There any chance you'd be cheered up
by an amazing trigonometry riddle?

229

Well, if you can't answer that,
there's no way you're gonna get this riddle.

Oh, hey. Hey, what do you think?

231
00:13:26,412 --> 00:13:30,708
Just because it's a boy, I don't think you need

I understand why Howard is nervous about
having a son, but are you really upset about it?

236

No, I'm fine.

Of course it's wrong. You don't know
what this little boy's gonna be like.

00:13:56,984 --> 00:13:58,652
Maybe he'll be rough and tumble.

Or maybe he'll be sweet and sensitive.

Or maybe he'll be all those things, like me.

with you right now?

00:14:55,709 --> 00:14:57,044
She's FaceTiming with my mom.

that is not a face you want to spend time with.

Maybe I've been neglecting our friendship.

with my mother. She doesn't care.

how manipulative my mother can be.

The question is: why is Penny

340
00:19:40,702 --> 00:19:41,995
No, it's not. Slow down.

341
00:19:42,162 --> 00:19:44,373
Don't tell me what to do.
You're not my father.

342
00:19:52,839 --> 00:19:56,552
- You know how fast you were going?
- A hundred and twelve.

343
00:19:58,637 --> 00:19:59,888
Let me see your license.

344
00:20:02,015 --> 00:20:03,934
- Okay, here's the plan.
- No.

345
00:20:05,978 --> 00:20:07,521
Fine.

346
00:20:07,854 --> 00:20:09,606
There you go.

347
00:20:11,358 --> 00:20:13,902
You know what, you can just keep it.
