00:00:05,178 --> 00:00:08,432
I was offered a summer research fellowship
at Princeton.

3
00:00:09,015 --> 00:00:10,517
A fine institution.

4
00:00:11,101 --> 00:00:13,520
The place where Albert Einstein taught.

5
00:00:13,687 --> 00:00:17,607
And where Leonard got his PhD,
so it may have gone downhill.

00:00:18,442 --> 00:00:23,196
Gentlemen, you may remember Dr. Nowitzki.
She's back at Caltech for her post-doc.

Question:

00:00:26,783 --> 00:00:29,453
Are you seeking
a romantic relationship with me?

10
00:00:30,162 --> 00:00:31,204
What if I were?

11
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:34,499
Well, that would raise a number of problems.

12
00:00:34,666 --> 00:00:37,169
We're colleagues, I'm currently in a relation—

13
00:00:42,174 --> 00:00:45,719
Amy? Amy? Amy?

14
00:00:59,191 --> 00:01:00,192
Will you marry me?

[CELL PHONE RINGING]

16
00:01:03,987 --> 00:01:05,906
One moment, please.

17
00:01:06,490 --> 00:01:08,658
Really? You're gonna answer that right now?

18
00:01:08,825 --> 00:01:11,244
Well, it's Leonard. I don't wanna be rude.

19
00:01:12,621 --> 00:01:13,914
- Hello.
- Hey, where you been?

20
00:01:14,081 --> 00:01:15,624
We've been calling you for hours.

21
00:01:15,791 --> 00:01:18,460
Oh, I'm sorry,
my phone was on airplane mode.

22
00:01:18,627 --> 00:01:22,798
- Why?
- Because I was on an airplane.

23
00:01:23,632 --> 00:01:25,050
Hey, put him on speaker.

24
00:01:25,217 --> 00:01:26,676
Hey, where are you?

25
00:01:26,843 --> 00:01:29,221
I came to Princeton to see Amy.

26
00:01:29,387 --> 00:01:31,014
It's a funny story, actually.

27
00:01:31,181 --> 00:01:35,018
I was having lunch with Dr. Nowitzki,
and she kissed me.

28
00:01:35,185 --> 00:01:37,312
- Excuse me?
- I'm sorry?

29
00:01:38,396 --> 00:01:39,397
And in that moment...

30
00:01:39,564 --> 00:01:45,570
I realized that Amy was the only woman
I ever wanted to kiss for the rest of my life.

31
00:01:45,737 --> 00:01:48,907
So I came to New Jersey
to ask her to marry me.

32
00:01:49,074 --> 00:01:50,867
- Oh, that's so sweet.
- Oh-ho-ho.

33
00:01:51,034 --> 00:01:52,244
Sheldon.

34
00:01:52,410 --> 00:01:55,956
Although there was one man
whose blessing I needed first.

35
00:01:56,998 --> 00:02:03,130
I've thought about it, and I really wanna
spend the rest of my life with Amy.

36
00:02:03,296 --> 00:02:05,382
Do I have your blessing?

COMPUTER VOICE:
Well, Sheldon...

38
00:02:09,219 --> 00:02:14,724
I think you should make her finger
like Saturn, and put a ring on it.

39
00:02:16,143 --> 00:02:19,312
You asked Stephen Hawking,
and not her father?

40
00:02:19,479 --> 00:02:21,064
Stephen Hawking's a genius.

41
00:02:21,231 --> 00:02:24,401
If he said no, I wasn't gonna
waste my time on her father.

42
00:02:25,569 --> 00:02:27,445
But you did ask my father?

43
00:02:27,612 --> 00:02:29,239
I did. He said yes.

44
00:02:29,406 --> 00:02:32,993
Although not in a robot voice,
so it wasn't nearly as cool.

45
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:35,412
Oh, my God, I can't believe
you guys are engaged.

46
00:02:35,579 --> 00:02:38,373
We're not engaged yet.
She's taking forever to answer.

47
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:40,458
Because you're on the phone.

48
00:02:42,669 --> 00:02:44,212
We'll call you back.

[RINGING]

50
00:02:49,801 --> 00:02:52,178
SHELDON: She said yes.
- Congratulations.

51
00:03:18,788 --> 00:03:22,292
- Mother, I have some good news to share—
- We're engaged. Heh.

52
00:03:24,044 --> 00:03:26,671
I am so happy for you two,
but I'm not surprised.

53
00:03:26,838 --> 00:03:28,340
I've been praying for this.

54
00:03:28,506 --> 00:03:30,425
Well, God had nothing to do with it.

55
00:03:30,592 --> 00:03:32,969
It happened because
I was kissing another woman.

56
00:03:33,136 --> 00:03:36,473
And it made me realize
I wanted to be with Amy.

57
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:41,102
More than one woman was interested in you?
I might've prayed a little too hard.

58
00:03:42,145 --> 00:03:46,191
And I wanna let you know right now
that we are not getting married in a church.

59
00:03:46,358 --> 00:03:50,028
That's all right, Sheldon.
Anywhere Jesus is, is a church.

60
00:03:50,195 --> 00:03:52,614
- Well, he won't be at our wedding.
- He's in my heart.

61
00:03:52,781 --> 00:03:55,450
So if I'm there, he'll be there.

62
00:03:55,617 --> 00:03:58,578
Then he's your plus-one.
You don't get to bring anyone else.

63
00:03:59,079 --> 00:04:02,082
- That's fine. Love you.
- Love you too. Bye.

64
00:04:03,583 --> 00:04:05,710
Lord, thank you.

65
00:04:05,877 --> 00:04:10,882
Even though you can do anything,
that was mighty impressive.

66
00:04:12,342 --> 00:04:13,551
We're engaged.

67
00:04:13,718 --> 00:04:15,887
Oh, my God, that's amazing.

68
00:04:16,054 --> 00:04:17,264
Uh, tell me everything.

69
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:19,849
Well, Dr. Nowitzki was kissing me—

70
00:04:20,016 --> 00:04:22,936
You can stop leading
with that part of the story.

71
00:04:23,937 --> 00:04:28,275
Congratulations, I'm so happy for you two.
Hold on, I have to tell Bernadette.

72
00:04:28,441 --> 00:04:29,734
Hey, Bernie, guess what.

73
00:04:29,901 --> 00:04:31,403
Sheldon and Amy got engaged.

74
00:04:31,569 --> 00:04:34,364
- Can you believe it?
- Oh, my God.

75
00:04:34,531 --> 00:04:36,783
I cannot believe it.

76
00:04:38,576 --> 00:04:42,038
She's so happy, I think she's crying. Heh.

77
00:04:45,041 --> 00:04:48,461
Think Sheldon's gonna want
some weird Star Trek wedding?

78
00:04:50,171 --> 00:04:51,172
I don't know.

79
00:04:51,339 --> 00:04:54,592
Well, Leonard could barely finish the words,
"Dr. Who wedding cake"...

80
00:04:54,759 --> 00:04:56,928
before I shut that down hard.

81
00:04:58,096 --> 00:04:59,139
Mm-hm.

82
00:05:00,015 --> 00:05:01,433
Are you listening to me?

83
00:05:01,599 --> 00:05:04,185
Yeah, you're mean to Leonard. I heard you.

84
00:05:05,061 --> 00:05:06,563
Is everything okay?

85
00:05:07,731 --> 00:05:10,567
Look, I'm gonna tell you something,
but you can't freak out...

86
00:05:10,734 --> 00:05:13,987
- ... because I'm already freaking out.
- Oh, my God. What is it?

87
00:05:15,071 --> 00:05:17,782
- I'm pregnant again.
- Wha—?

88
00:05:24,414 --> 00:05:25,665
Interesting.

89
00:05:28,877 --> 00:05:31,921
- Howard's gonna lose his mind.
- Wait, you haven't told him yet?

90
00:05:32,088 --> 00:05:36,217
- No.
- So you told me first? Oh, Bernie.

91
00:05:37,719 --> 00:05:40,055
This wasn't supposed to happen.
We were careful.

92
00:05:40,221 --> 00:05:41,473
I didn't think you could...

93
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:44,726
- ... get pregnant while breastfeeding.
- Well, guess what. You can.

94
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:47,103
Then, look, this is a good thing.

95
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:50,190
Halley's gonna have a little brother
or sister to play with.

96
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:54,152
- I guess that would be pretty cute.
- I was a surprise to my parents...

97
00:05:54,319 --> 00:05:57,447
and my dad said it was the best thing
that ever happened to them.

98
00:05:57,614 --> 00:06:01,117
Okay. Maybe this baby actually is a blessing.

99
00:06:01,284 --> 00:06:02,952
Oh, my God, honey, of course it is.

100
00:06:03,119 --> 00:06:04,704
Heh.

101
00:06:05,413 --> 00:06:08,333
- How am I pregnant again?
- Yeah, what were you thinking?

102
00:06:12,295 --> 00:06:15,215
All right, I'm all checked in to my flight.

103
00:06:15,381 --> 00:06:18,802
Well, I'm sad you're leaving.
Why'd you only book a flight for one day?

104
00:06:19,385 --> 00:06:21,346
I came here to propose.

105
00:06:21,513 --> 00:06:25,600
If you'd said no, I wouldn't want
to stick around looking at your stupid face.

106
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:31,314
Now, mind you, your face is only stupid
in the "no" version of the story.

107
00:06:32,524 --> 00:06:35,443
But I said yes, so I get a lifetime of this.

108
00:06:36,236 --> 00:06:38,154
Yes, you do, smart face.

109
00:06:39,364 --> 00:06:41,032
Why don't you stay a few extra days?

110
00:06:41,616 --> 00:06:43,451
Well, I don't have any other clothes.

111
00:06:43,618 --> 00:06:46,412
- We'll get you some.
- I don't know, I'm pretty particular.

112
00:06:46,871 --> 00:06:49,374
There's a comic book store
less than a mile from here.

113
00:06:49,541 --> 00:06:51,501
Perfect, let's go shopping.

114
00:06:52,335 --> 00:06:55,130
Oh, um, and I'm having dinner
with some colleagues tonight.

115
00:06:55,296 --> 00:06:56,840
I'm sure they'd love to meet you.

116
00:06:57,298 --> 00:06:59,634
- Eh...
- Come on. What do you say?

117
00:06:59,801 --> 00:07:02,887
Aww. You're nagging me.

118
00:07:03,429 --> 00:07:05,890
It's like we're already married.

119
00:07:06,057 --> 00:07:09,978
- Is that a yes or a no?
- Gee, save some for the honeymoon.

120
00:07:13,022 --> 00:07:14,607
Look at Nowitzki over there.

121
00:07:15,108 --> 00:07:17,652
I can't believe she tried
to steal Sheldon from Amy.

122
00:07:17,861 --> 00:07:20,113
You know what?
I'm gonna go there and tell her...

123
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:23,283
that they're engaged now
and that her little plan didn't work.

124
00:07:23,450 --> 00:07:26,494
Are you sticking up for Sheldon,
or still mad she rejected you?

125
00:07:26,661 --> 00:07:28,121
Too far away. Can't hear you.

126
00:07:30,206 --> 00:07:32,292
- Hello, Ramona.
- Hello.

127
00:07:32,834 --> 00:07:35,253
Why are you sitting by yourself?

128
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:39,674
Oh, that's right, Sheldon's in New Jersey,
being engaged to Amy.

129
00:07:41,384 --> 00:07:42,427
I heard.

130
00:07:42,594 --> 00:07:44,429
Now that Sheldon's out of the picture...

131
00:07:44,596 --> 00:07:47,765
I could give you one more chance
to go out with me.

132
00:07:48,558 --> 00:07:49,851
Nope, I'm good.

133
00:07:52,812 --> 00:07:54,314
You sure?

134
00:07:54,939 --> 00:07:57,275
I will not ask again.

135
00:07:57,442 --> 00:07:59,652
I sincerely hope not.

136
00:08:01,571 --> 00:08:05,241
Very well. I'm going to leave
before this gets awkward.

137
00:08:09,412 --> 00:08:13,708
- Hey, want me to make dinner?
- Sure, but first why don't you have a seat?

138
00:08:13,875 --> 00:08:16,169
There's something I need to show you.

139
00:08:16,336 --> 00:08:19,964
Ooh. If it's how to make dinner,
that'd be great. Heh-heh.

140
00:08:27,555 --> 00:08:30,266
Is this a pregnancy test?

00:08:31,226 --> 00:08:32,268
Yes.

142
00:08:35,563 --> 00:08:37,524
That means...

- Heh. No. Heh.

- I mean, we were careful.
- Well, it did.

151
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:09,931
- No. No. No.
- Yes. Yes. Yes.

Okay, okay, okay.
Well, what are we gonna do?

153
00:09:13,351 --> 00:09:15,645
What do you mean?
We're gonna have another baby.

154
00:09:15,812 --> 00:09:17,105
- No. No.
- Stop that.

00:09:17,272 --> 00:09:19,732
- Yes.
- I'm trying!

we're both responsible adults.
We can do this.

No.

- Hey, Stuart.
- Oh. Hey, Raj.

- I need to buy an engagement gift.

162

- Well, you came to the wrong place.
- Heh.

163
00:09:45,049 --> 00:09:46,593
It's for Sheldon and Amy.

164

- No way. They're engaged?
- Yeah.

00:09:49,053 --> 00:09:50,221
That's exciting news.

166
00:09:50,388 --> 00:09:53,766
Who'd have thought Sheldon and Amy
would be the next two to tie the knot?

167
00:09:53,933 --> 00:09:56,436
Tell me about it. I'm the one
who caught the bouquet...

00:10:02,108 --> 00:10:04,777
they might like this.

171
00:10:04,944 --> 00:10:07,864
Superman and Wonder Woman.
It's kind of romantic.

172
00:10:08,239 --> 00:10:09,741
Hmm.

173
00:10:09,991 --> 00:10:12,535
You know what?
Why am I buying them a gift?

174
00:10:12,702 --> 00:10:15,163
They have love.
Screw them and their happiness.

175
00:10:15,330 --> 00:10:18,124
What do you have for someone
who's bitter and alone?

176
00:10:19,459 --> 00:10:21,628
Literally everything.

177
00:10:24,714 --> 00:10:27,425
Sheldon, these are the heads
of my research team.

178
00:10:27,592 --> 00:10:30,470
Dr. Zane, Dr. Harris, this is my fiancé,
Dr. Sheldon Cooper.

179
00:10:30,637 --> 00:10:34,390
That's the first time I've said that,
and it kind of gave me the goose bumps.

180
00:10:35,266 --> 00:10:37,435
Dr. Cooper, we are so excited to meet you.

181
00:10:37,602 --> 00:10:39,937
Oh, that's very kind of you.

182
00:10:40,104 --> 00:10:43,441
If you'd like, I could autograph
your menus after dinner.

183
00:10:43,608 --> 00:10:46,361
- But I better not see those on eBay.
- Heh-heh.

184
00:10:46,736 --> 00:10:50,698
No, no, no, we're just excited to meet the man
who landed this brilliant woman here.

185
00:10:50,865 --> 00:10:54,369
Oh, that wasn't hard.
She threw herself at me.

186
00:10:55,995 --> 00:11:01,584
Now, getting the universe to show me
its naughty bits, that took some doing.

187
00:11:02,418 --> 00:11:03,836
Sheldon's a physicist.

188
00:11:04,003 --> 00:11:06,589
- Oh.
- Oh, that's nice.

189
00:11:09,550 --> 00:11:13,513
Amy, I recently read your paper on
lesions in the olfactory receptors in the brain.

190
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,473
It was inspired.

191
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:17,725
Oh, well, I guess it didn't stink.

192
00:11:17,892 --> 00:11:20,103
And if it did, that rat wouldn't have known it.

193
00:11:20,269 --> 00:11:21,270
[CHUCKLING]

194
00:11:21,437 --> 00:11:25,233
I'm sorry, I'm sure you don't want to sit here
and listen to a bunch of work talk.

195
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:27,485
Oh, no, I love it. Let's talk about work.

196
00:11:27,652 --> 00:11:30,780
Amy's work, my work.
Why don't we start with my work?

197
00:11:31,781 --> 00:11:33,866
Actually, I do have a question for Dr. Cooper.

198
00:11:34,033 --> 00:11:37,578
When Amy first told you about
her approach to synaptic tracing...

199
00:11:37,745 --> 00:11:40,415
did you think it was gonna
revolutionize the field?

200
00:11:41,124 --> 00:11:42,542
Really?

201
00:11:42,708 --> 00:11:44,210
That's your question?

202
00:11:44,377 --> 00:11:46,295
What are you, Entertainment Tonight?

203
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:49,882
You know, I'll give you a better question.

204
00:11:50,049 --> 00:11:54,887
"Dr. Cooper, I heard you were working on
a top-secret project for the U.S. military.

205
00:11:55,054 --> 00:11:58,391
Why don't you tell us about that?"
See, that's a great question.

206
00:11:59,267 --> 00:12:01,352
Okay, what was that like?

207
00:12:01,853 --> 00:12:04,647
Well, I can't tell you that. It's top-secret.

208
00:12:09,694 --> 00:12:12,822
Boy, that was exhausting.

209
00:12:12,989 --> 00:12:15,825
No offense, but your colleagues
were pretty rude.

210
00:12:17,118 --> 00:12:19,745
- Really? They were rude?
- Yes.

211
00:12:19,912 --> 00:12:22,540
They just kept talking about you
and how great you are.

212
00:12:22,707 --> 00:12:25,460
No matter how many times I brought me up.

213
00:12:26,043 --> 00:12:28,838
These are my colleagues
and they want to talk about my work.

214
00:12:29,005 --> 00:12:30,631
Why does that bother you so much?

215
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:32,758
Because I was there.

216
00:12:32,925 --> 00:12:36,929
It's like having Optimus Prime over to dinner
and not asking him to turn into a truck.

217
00:12:38,806 --> 00:12:42,727
You know what, Sheldon? You're not always
the smartest person in every room.

218
00:12:42,894 --> 00:12:45,730
You may not even be
the smartest person in this room.

219
00:12:45,897 --> 00:12:50,276
Oh, I'm sorry, is Neil DeGrasse Tyson
hiding behind the couch?

220
00:12:50,443 --> 00:12:54,238
Because if he is, he's not that smart.
It's pretty dusty back there.

221
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,952
- Where are you going?
- I'm storming off to my room.

222
00:13:00,119 --> 00:13:02,079
Then where am I supposed to storm off to?

223
00:13:02,246 --> 00:13:04,999
Well, you're so smart,
why don't you figure it out?

224
00:13:08,586 --> 00:13:10,213
Is there another bedroom?

225
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:13,633
Perhaps a den?

226
00:13:17,595 --> 00:13:23,267
So how are you guys doing
with all the new events in your womb?

227
00:13:27,104 --> 00:13:29,482
You know, obviously, it was a surprise.

228
00:13:30,107 --> 00:13:31,943
There was some crying and some yelling.

229
00:13:32,109 --> 00:13:34,820
Some suggestion of make-up sex
that did not go over well...

230
00:13:34,987 --> 00:13:37,490
even though it's not like
we can get more pregnant.

231
00:13:40,034 --> 00:13:41,869
But then we realized that it's a gift...

232
00:13:42,036 --> 00:13:44,580
in the sense that we didn't ask for it...

233
00:13:44,747 --> 00:13:48,292
- ... and we may not have chosen it—
- And we already have one.

234
00:13:50,711 --> 00:13:52,630
You know, whenever I find a top I like...

235
00:13:52,797 --> 00:13:55,841
I always go back and get a second one
in a different color.

236
00:13:59,554 --> 00:14:02,807
Which I hope is not the case with your baby.

237
00:14:04,725 --> 00:14:07,562
I know you guys are freaked out,
but you're great parents...

238
00:14:07,728 --> 00:14:10,022
and if you ever need help,
we are here for you.

239
00:14:10,189 --> 00:14:12,275
Yeah, anything at all. Just ask.

240
00:14:13,859 --> 00:14:15,319
You know what you could do?

241
00:14:15,486 --> 00:14:17,863
You could have a baby too.

242
00:14:21,659 --> 00:14:23,327
I'm sorry, what?

243
00:14:24,078 --> 00:14:26,581
That's a great idea.
We could go through it together.

244
00:14:26,747 --> 00:14:27,832
Wouldn't that be fun?

245
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:32,628
Heh. You guys were just saying
how freaked out and miserable you are.

246
00:14:32,795 --> 00:14:37,466
I say a lot of crazy things.
I'm pregnant and hormonal.

247
00:14:38,050 --> 00:14:39,844
Do it. Have a baby. Do it.

248
00:14:41,554 --> 00:14:43,973
Come on, it'd be so cute.
Our kids playing together.

249
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:47,685
What do you say? Why don't you two
hit the old mattress and whip up a family?

250
00:14:47,852 --> 00:14:50,688
We're not gonna have a baby
just to make you guys feel better.

251
00:14:50,855 --> 00:14:53,733
Yeah. If we're gonna have a baby,
it'll be when we are ready...

252
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:57,403
- ... or when I'm certain Penny's gonna leave me.
- Exactly.

253
00:15:00,907 --> 00:15:03,409
They're my friends,
and I should be happy for them.

254
00:15:03,576 --> 00:15:05,036
And I'm trying...

255
00:15:05,202 --> 00:15:09,248
but all I feel is this gnawing,
empty sensation in my gut.

256
00:15:09,415 --> 00:15:11,208
I had that once.

257
00:15:11,375 --> 00:15:13,794
Turned out it was a tapeworm.

258
00:15:16,756 --> 00:15:18,090
Cool. Uh...

259
00:15:19,425 --> 00:15:22,511
It's just— It's hard talking
to my other friends about this...

260
00:15:22,678 --> 00:15:25,222
- ... but I knew you'd understand.
- Why is that?

261
00:15:25,389 --> 00:15:26,974
Because you and I are both alone.

262
00:15:27,141 --> 00:15:30,937
Which is actually kind of comforting,
because at least we can be alone together.

263
00:15:31,562 --> 00:15:34,523
Mm. This is— This is awkward. I, um...

264
00:15:34,690 --> 00:15:38,152
I was actually gonna close up
a little early tonight because I have a date.

265
00:15:39,278 --> 00:15:41,656
- Really?
- Yeah.

[CLEARS THROAT]

267
00:15:43,074 --> 00:15:46,619
Forgive me if I'm having trouble
being happy for you.

268
00:15:47,787 --> 00:15:50,998
Don't be silly. I'm loving your pain.

269
00:15:54,293 --> 00:15:56,587
Is this how our marriage is going to be?

270
00:15:56,754 --> 00:16:00,132
Sometimes people will be more interested
in talking to her than to me?

271
00:16:00,299 --> 00:16:03,094
COMPUTER VOICE:
Are you sitting in the bathroom?

272
00:16:04,095 --> 00:16:05,137
Yes.

273
00:16:05,304 --> 00:16:09,767
I needed a place to storm off to,
and it was all that was available.

274
00:16:09,934 --> 00:16:14,855
Fine, but if I hear a flush,
this conversation is over.

275
00:16:15,523 --> 00:16:18,818
But those people were
in the presence of a world-class mind.

276
00:16:18,985 --> 00:16:21,946
And all they wanted to talk about
was their own nonsense.

277
00:16:22,113 --> 00:16:25,408
Can you see the irony in that statement?

278
00:16:27,910 --> 00:16:30,079
How about now?

279
00:16:32,331 --> 00:16:34,542
How about now?

280
00:16:36,961 --> 00:16:38,045
I'll wait.

281
00:16:41,298 --> 00:16:42,967
Uh— Surprise.

00:16:43,134 --> 00:16:45,720
Oh, crap, is it our anniversary?

283
00:16:47,054 --> 00:16:49,056
No. Wait.

284
00:16:52,143 --> 00:16:53,853
- No.
- No. Okay.

285
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:56,439
- All right, so, what are we celebrating?
- Well...

Bernadette and Howard are pregnant again.
Amy and Sheldon are getting married.

287
00:17:00,401 --> 00:17:02,403
- I didn't want you to feel left out.
- Oh...

288
00:17:02,570 --> 00:17:05,489
Left out? Bernadette has
to grow a baby inside of her...

289
00:17:05,656 --> 00:17:08,617
and Amy has to marry one. My life is great.

290
00:17:10,828 --> 00:17:14,582
- So do you not want the cake? I can—
- Try and take it away, see what happens.

291
00:17:17,543 --> 00:17:20,337
Oh, crap, it is our anniversary.

Happy anniversary.

Amy.

294
00:17:29,013 --> 00:17:31,682
There's something I need to say to you.

295
00:17:31,849 --> 00:17:33,476
I'm listening.

296
00:17:34,351 --> 00:17:37,146
I've been thinking about the Avengers.

297
00:17:39,398 --> 00:17:41,776
I believe that.

298
00:17:41,942 --> 00:17:45,112
I don't think that's something
you needed to say to me.

299
00:17:45,279 --> 00:17:48,866
I realized that Iron Man is great.

300
00:17:49,033 --> 00:17:52,036
And also that Captain America is great.

301
00:17:52,203 --> 00:17:55,831
And sometimes Iron Man
is in a Captain America movie.

302
00:17:55,998 --> 00:17:58,501
And he's not mad
it's not an Iron Man movie.

303
00:17:58,667 --> 00:18:02,838
No, he can fly in,
give the audience a thrill, and then fly away.

304
00:18:03,506 --> 00:18:06,717
And that should've been me tonight.

305
00:18:06,926 --> 00:18:10,888
I should've been the delightful cameo
in your movie.

306
00:18:12,181 --> 00:18:13,307
Thank you, Sheldon.

307
00:18:13,974 --> 00:18:15,559
Instead, I was like the Hulk—

308
00:18:15,726 --> 00:18:17,853
Okay, please,
stop talking about the Avengers.

00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:21,107
Anyway...

310
00:18:21,690 --> 00:18:22,983
I'm proud of you.

311
00:18:23,150 --> 00:18:29,406
And I'm going to try to do a better job
of sharing the spotlight, because we're a team.

312
00:18:29,573 --> 00:18:31,700
You know, much like...

313
00:18:32,368 --> 00:18:34,495
the Dodgers.

314
00:18:36,789 --> 00:18:39,542
If they had superpowers.

315
00:18:39,708 --> 00:18:41,293
And fought crime.

316
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:43,629
And Thor was in them.

317
00:18:45,714 --> 00:18:48,759
Sheldon, I know this isn't easy...

318
00:18:48,926 --> 00:18:51,220
but you'll have a whole lifetime to practice.

319
00:18:51,887 --> 00:18:55,307
It could take that long. I'm really bad at it.

320
00:18:58,394 --> 00:19:00,020
You know, maybe, um...

321
00:19:00,187 --> 00:19:02,439
I should start right now...

322
00:19:02,606 --> 00:19:06,193
and go back to Pasadena,
and let you have this experience to yourself.

323
00:19:07,194 --> 00:19:10,489
You wanna go back because that's
where everybody makes a fuss over you.

324
00:19:10,656 --> 00:19:13,576
Your colleagues are right, you are brilliant.

325
00:19:19,623 --> 00:19:21,333
- Hello.
HOWARD: Hey.

326
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:23,627
- Welcome back.
- Let me see the ring.

327
00:19:24,295 --> 00:19:28,215
- Ooh, nice.
- Hey, hey, hey. Her eyes are up there.

328
00:19:30,801 --> 00:19:33,304
Is that the woman who kissed Sheldon?

329
00:19:33,512 --> 00:19:37,558
- Uh... Could be.
- Hard to say. Tell us about Princeton.

330
00:19:38,517 --> 00:19:41,312
- Excuse me for a minute.
- No, we'll catch up later.

331
00:19:42,146 --> 00:19:45,232
This will be the biggest smackdown
since my Aunt Nupur showed up...

332
00:19:45,399 --> 00:19:49,069
at the family reunion
wearing the same sari as my cousin Shruti.

333
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:52,698
Dr. Nowitzki?

334
00:19:53,616 --> 00:19:57,077
Oh. Dr. Fowler. Um...

335
00:19:57,244 --> 00:19:58,245
