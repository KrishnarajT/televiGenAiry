1
00:00:02,979 --> 00:00:05,981
Hey! Look what I got everybody.

2
00:00:05,983 --> 00:00:10,218
Newspapers? Did you find
a portal back to the 1990s?

3
00:00:11,522 --> 00:00:13,756
No. If he had that,
he'd be trying to prevent NSYNC

4
00:00:13,757 --> 00:00:15,389
from breaking up.

5
00:00:15,391 --> 00:00:17,125
Oh, please.
I'm glad they broke up.

6
00:00:17,127 --> 00:00:19,828
Otherwise, Justin would
never have brought sexy back.

7
00:00:20,997 --> 00:00:23,397
One thing you can't get
on an iPad,

8
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,967
the smell of ink and paper.

9
00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:28,369
One more reason
iPads are better.

10
00:00:29,939 --> 00:00:31,540
They reviewed
my planetarium show.

11
00:00:31,542 --> 00:00:34,443
Yeah. It's on page three
of the Arts and Leisure section.

12
00:00:42,353 --> 00:00:44,920
Oh, look, they still
have Far Side.

13
00:00:44,922 --> 00:00:46,889
Oh, I don't
get that one.

14
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:49,758
Oh, he's pushing
when he should be pulling.

15
00:00:49,759 --> 00:00:54,096
Hmm. I don't think he belongs
in that gifted school, then.

16
00:00:54,097 --> 00:00:55,898
What are you doing?
Making a boat.

17
00:00:55,899 --> 00:00:57,999
When I was a kid,
my dad showed me how.

18
00:00:58,002 --> 00:01:00,868
Boy, you'll do anything
to avoid reading.

19
00:01:02,206 --> 00:01:04,206
Guys, it's under
“Things to do this weekend.”

20
00:01:04,207 --> 00:01:06,008
I can't find it.
What does it say?

21
00:01:06,009 --> 00:01:09,277
That it's a thing
to do this weekend.

22
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:12,080
That's great, Raj.
Congratulations.

23
00:01:12,081 --> 00:01:13,247
You know, while we're bragging,

24
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:14,883
The Journal
of Prosthetic Medicine

25
00:01:14,884 --> 00:01:17,119
just wrote up the project that
Howard and I are working on.

26
00:01:17,121 --> 00:01:19,253
Well, you didn't
tell me that.

27
00:01:19,256 --> 00:01:21,490
Oh, it just came out.
It's just a little blurb.

28
00:01:21,491 --> 00:01:23,559
Oh, well, good for you.

29
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:25,794
You know, Bert and I have
started isolating zircons

30
00:01:25,795 --> 00:01:28,262
from meteorites
for our dark matter search.

31
00:01:28,264 --> 00:01:29,631
Oh. Well, how nice.

32
00:01:29,633 --> 00:01:31,066
Everyone's doing
impressive work.

33
00:01:31,068 --> 00:01:32,800
What have you been
working on these days?

34
00:01:32,803 --> 00:01:35,603
Whoa, whoa. Where'd
that come from?

35
00:01:35,606 --> 00:01:37,673
Where did what come from?

36
00:01:37,675 --> 00:01:38,973
I try to be supportive,

37
00:01:38,976 --> 00:01:42,377
and you break out the hot
lights and the rubber hose.

38
00:01:42,378 --> 00:01:44,045
I just asked
what you've been working on.

39
00:01:44,048 --> 00:01:46,014
Oh, my God, let it go.

40
00:01:46,015 --> 00:01:47,482
Do you believe this guy?

41
00:01:47,484 --> 00:01:50,285
I did it!

42
00:01:51,822 --> 00:01:54,756
See? It's a... it's a boat.

43
00:01:56,459 --> 00:02:00,127

54
00:02:29,352 --> 00:02:31,720
Okay, how do you want
to play this?

55
00:02:31,722 --> 00:02:33,688
Do you want to pretend like
nothing's bothering you

56
00:02:33,691 --> 00:02:35,323
and blow up later,
or do you just want to be

57
00:02:35,325 --> 00:02:37,859
a maniac right now?

58
00:02:37,862 --> 00:02:40,929
Nothing is bothering me.

59
00:02:40,931 --> 00:02:42,798
Fine. Be that way.

60
00:02:42,799 --> 00:02:47,102
If you want to talk,
I'll be flushing my sinuses.

61
00:02:47,103 --> 00:02:48,936
Wait.

62
00:02:48,938 --> 00:02:50,606
I have a confession.

63
00:02:50,608 --> 00:02:53,307
When I berated Leonard,

64
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:56,178
it was a clever ruse
to conceal the fact

65
00:02:56,179 --> 00:02:58,380
that I'm not
working on anything.

66
00:02:58,381 --> 00:03:00,882
Well, I think
I speak for everyone

67
00:03:00,884 --> 00:03:03,886
when I say, “No!”

68
00:03:03,937 --> 00:03:08,107
The truth is I have
nothing of interest to pursue.

69
00:03:08,109 --> 00:03:10,341
Well, maybe this is
the perfect opportunity

70
00:03:10,343 --> 00:03:13,178
to take some time
for yourself and refocus.

71
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:16,247
I'm sure you'll find something
you're excited about.

72
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:17,916
Thank you, Amy.

73
00:03:17,918 --> 00:03:20,318
I don't know what I'd do
without you.

74
00:03:21,239 --> 00:03:23,972
Hey, can I stay here?
Sheldon kicked me out.

75
00:03:23,975 --> 00:03:26,074
Well, is everything okay?

76
00:03:26,077 --> 00:03:28,776
Yeah. He just wants
some alone time to work.

77
00:03:28,779 --> 00:03:29,912
Fine.
Make yourself at home.

78
00:03:29,913 --> 00:03:31,447
Yeah. We were just about
to watch a little TV.

79
00:03:31,448 --> 00:03:32,548
You're welcome
to join us.

80
00:03:32,549 --> 00:03:33,782
Thanks. I'll be right with you.

81
00:03:33,783 --> 00:03:36,185
I just have to, uh,
do my neti pot.

82
00:03:45,696 --> 00:03:48,631
So what are you guys
gonna watch?

83
00:03:51,202 --> 00:03:52,835
Okay.

84
00:03:52,836 --> 00:03:55,270
Hey, uh, what do you think
we should open our show with?

85
00:03:55,273 --> 00:04:00,174
Uh, “Thor and Doctor Jones”
or “Let's Get Astrophysical”?

86
00:04:00,176 --> 00:04:02,244
I don't know. I think
we should start with something

87
00:04:02,245 --> 00:04:03,679
that gets them up on their feet.

88
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:06,448
Maybe
“Sherlock Around the Clock.”

89
00:04:06,449 --> 00:04:08,783
Great, yeah.
Uh, let's give it a try.

90
00:04:11,756 --> 00:04:14,188
Halley's napping! Keep it down!

91
00:04:14,191 --> 00:04:15,924
Oh. Right. Sorry.

92
00:04:15,926 --> 00:04:19,294
It's cool.
We don't need volume to rock.

93
00:04:19,297 --> 00:04:21,462
Instead of blowing
the roof off this place,

94
00:04:21,465 --> 00:04:23,164
we can gently lift it off

95
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:25,833
and set it quietly down
in the backyard.

96
00:04:26,737 --> 00:04:28,003
Okay.

97
00:04:28,004 --> 00:04:29,571
One, two, three, four.

98
00:04:31,441 --> 00:04:33,374
♪ Holmes said to Watson ♪

99
00:04:33,376 --> 00:04:34,977
♪ On Baker Street ♪

100
00:04:34,979 --> 00:04:36,612

104
00:04:42,453 --> 00:04:44,186

105
00:04:44,188 --> 00:04:45,653

107
00:04:47,458 --> 00:04:49,657

108
00:04:51,828 --> 00:04:54,028
Nice going.

109
00:04:54,030 --> 00:04:56,030
Sorry. Sorry. I'll get her.

110
00:04:56,032 --> 00:04:57,900
One sec.

111
00:04:59,302 --> 00:05:02,071
You bought diapers, right?

112
00:05:03,239 --> 00:05:05,340
Be right back.

113
00:05:05,342 --> 00:05:07,643
Rock and roll!

114
00:05:10,381 --> 00:05:13,248
Okay. Scratch paper, check.

115
00:05:13,249 --> 00:05:15,316
Whiteboard, check.

116
00:05:15,318 --> 00:05:18,686
Chex Mix, check.

117
00:05:18,688 --> 00:05:21,789
And here we go.

118
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:25,794
Oh, dang it.

119
00:05:25,796 --> 00:05:27,328
Hello, Mother.

120
00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:29,263
Hi there, Shelly.
You will never believe

121
00:05:29,265 --> 00:05:32,167
who I ran into
at the barbecue festival.

122
00:05:32,169 --> 00:05:34,737
I am right in the middle
of some very important work.

123
00:05:34,739 --> 00:05:36,739
I don't have time for this
right now.

124
00:05:36,741 --> 00:05:38,941
Then why did you
answer the phone?

125
00:05:38,943 --> 00:05:41,109
Because you raised me
to be polite.

126
00:05:41,112 --> 00:05:42,910
Now stop bothering me.

127
00:06:12,609 --> 00:06:14,842
Hello again.

128
00:06:14,845 --> 00:06:17,912
Who did you see
at the barbecue festival?

129
00:06:17,914 --> 00:06:19,881
Mr. Watkins.

130
00:06:19,883 --> 00:06:21,182
Really?

131
00:06:21,184 --> 00:06:23,551
You called me and interrupted
my work to tell me

132
00:06:23,554 --> 00:06:26,287
that you ran into somebody
you could plausibly run into?

133
00:06:26,289 --> 00:06:28,657
I'm sorry, Mother,
I really need to focus here.

134
00:06:28,659 --> 00:06:30,292
I will speak to you next week.

135
00:06:30,294 --> 00:06:32,494
Okay, sweetheart.
I'll talk to you then.

136
00:06:41,806 --> 00:06:45,039
I thought Mr. Watkins
moved to Florida.

137
00:06:45,042 --> 00:06:48,576
He did.
He was back visiting his son.

138
00:06:48,578 --> 00:06:50,746
Oh, gosh darn it,
that is interesting.

139
00:06:50,748 --> 00:06:52,513
Was it Tommy or Joe?

140
00:06:52,515 --> 00:06:55,017
I bet it was Joe, 'cause
he and Tommy had a falling out

141
00:06:55,018 --> 00:06:57,186
over that time-share.

142
00:06:58,354 --> 00:07:00,922
You guys do anything
fun after dinner?

143
00:07:00,924 --> 00:07:03,357
Well, actually Amy came
back over and we hung out.

144
00:07:03,359 --> 00:07:05,527
Did you know that we're both
spelling bee champs?

145
00:07:05,528 --> 00:07:09,131
We stayed up for hours
trying to stump each other.

146
00:07:09,133 --> 00:07:10,799
Who won?

147
00:07:10,801 --> 00:07:13,268
Oh, she thought she had me
with “appoggiatura,”

148
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:16,537
but I shut that down
expeditiously.

149
00:07:16,539 --> 00:07:19,140
E-X-P-E-D-I-T-I-O-U-S-L-Y.

150
00:07:19,143 --> 00:07:21,275
Expeditiously.

151
00:07:21,277 --> 00:07:25,580
Wow. I bet that made Penny
take off all of her clothes.

152
00:07:26,984 --> 00:07:30,051
Put her pajamas on and
then go to bed early.

153
00:07:30,054 --> 00:07:32,020
At, like, 9:00.
Yeah.

154
00:07:32,022 --> 00:07:34,556
- Hey. - Hey.
- Hey.

155
00:07:34,557 --> 00:07:36,525
Oh, are we still on
for band practice this evening?

156
00:07:36,527 --> 00:07:37,993
Oh, shoot.

157
00:07:37,994 --> 00:07:41,028
I promised I would take Halley
over to Bernadette's parents.

158
00:07:41,030 --> 00:07:42,674
Dude, the gig is,
like, next weekend.

159
00:07:42,698 --> 00:07:43,700
I know.

160
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:45,900
I'm sorry.
I really want to do this,

161
00:07:45,902 --> 00:07:48,402
but I just don't think
I have the time.

162
00:07:48,405 --> 00:07:51,140
Okay. I-I guess
I'll have to cancel.

163
00:07:51,142 --> 00:07:54,443
Toby Greenbaum will have to
become a man without us.

164
00:07:54,445 --> 00:07:56,878
Too bad, you guys
kill at bar mitzvahs.

165
00:07:56,881 --> 00:07:59,715
And other events that
people can't leave.

166
00:08:01,451 --> 00:08:04,419
I don't want to be the one
who breaks up the band.

167
00:08:04,421 --> 00:08:07,054
You know, maybe you should...

168
00:08:07,056 --> 00:08:08,857
think about replacing me.

169
00:08:08,859 --> 00:08:10,926
Okay.
I mean,

170
00:08:10,927 --> 00:08:13,962
I know it'll be hard since we...

171
00:08:13,963 --> 00:08:15,963
Oh, I bet Bert could do it.
He plays guitar.

172
00:08:15,965 --> 00:08:17,198
I'm gonna go ask him.

173
00:08:19,102 --> 00:08:23,806
I guess he forgot that
I play the cello.

174
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:27,309
I-I don't think he did.

175
00:08:28,546 --> 00:08:30,479
Okay, I think it's ready.

176
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:32,313
Should we put on
safety goggles?

177
00:08:32,316 --> 00:08:36,018
Well, the funnest fun
is the safest fun, so yes.

178
00:08:36,019 --> 00:08:37,152
Hey.

179
00:08:37,153 --> 00:08:38,186
Hi.
Hello.

180
00:08:38,188 --> 00:08:41,156
Oh, Amy, you're here... again.

181
00:08:41,157 --> 00:08:43,090
Yeah, Sheldon said he needed
another night to work,

182
00:08:43,093 --> 00:08:44,893
so I said I'd give him
some space.

183
00:08:44,894 --> 00:08:46,261
So what's all this?

184
00:08:46,263 --> 00:08:48,931
Well, Amy and I were talking
about old science fair projects,

185
00:08:48,932 --> 00:08:50,632
and how fun it would be
to recreate them.

186
00:08:50,633 --> 00:08:52,167
We're making hot ice.

187
00:08:52,168 --> 00:08:53,335
Mm-hmm. It's pretty cool.

188
00:08:53,336 --> 00:08:55,704
Nice one.
Yeah.

189
00:08:55,705 --> 00:08:57,038
Turns out we both

190
00:08:57,041 --> 00:08:59,807
did this as our science fair
projects in ninth grade.

191
00:08:59,810 --> 00:09:01,609
Do you remember any of
your high school projects?

192
00:09:01,611 --> 00:09:05,180
Uh, well, I remember
telling Jenny Runyon

193
00:09:05,181 --> 00:09:07,382
that I would teach her
how to flirt with boys

194
00:09:07,383 --> 00:09:09,017
if she put my name
on her project.

195
00:09:09,018 --> 00:09:13,287
I got an “A,” she got pregnant.

196
00:09:13,290 --> 00:09:16,191
Girls like you are why I had to
come straight home after school.

197
00:09:17,561 --> 00:09:20,162
Check this out.

198
00:09:22,566 --> 00:09:24,233
Wow, that's amazing.

199
00:09:24,234 --> 00:09:25,499
Mm-hmm.

200
00:09:25,502 --> 00:09:27,536
The crystallization is
an exothermic process,

201
00:09:27,537 --> 00:09:29,037
so the ice is actually hot.

202
00:09:29,038 --> 00:09:31,138
I won first place for this.
So did I.

203
00:09:31,141 --> 00:09:33,407
I threw Jenny's baby shower.

204
00:09:33,409 --> 00:09:35,777
Oh, hey, in seventh grade,

205
00:09:35,778 --> 00:09:37,311
I built a cobra wave.
You want to do that?

206
00:09:37,313 --> 00:09:39,715
Oh, we can come up with
a wave speed formula,

207
00:09:39,716 --> 00:09:41,984
and see how accurately
we can predict the amplitude.

208
00:09:41,985 --> 00:09:43,652
Wow, I didn't think
anything could top

209
00:09:43,653 --> 00:09:46,922
last night's spelling bee,
but here comes math.

210
00:09:46,923 --> 00:09:49,590
I'm sorry, we-we don't
have to do more experiments.

211
00:09:49,593 --> 00:09:51,560
Let's do something
we can all enjoy.

212
00:09:51,561 --> 00:09:54,128
Hey, uh, you want to watch
that show you like

213
00:09:54,130 --> 00:09:57,231
where people want to buy a house
and then they do?

214
00:09:58,101 --> 00:09:59,434
No, no, you guys do
your experiments.

215
00:09:59,436 --> 00:10:00,435
I'll go pick up dinner.

216
00:10:00,436 --> 00:10:01,369
Are you sure?

217
00:10:01,372 --> 00:10:02,537
Yeah, you're having science fun,

218
00:10:02,538 --> 00:10:06,108
and I don't want to interfere,
or watch you.

219
00:10:13,816 --> 00:10:15,950
Did I actually do it?

220
00:10:15,952 --> 00:10:20,122
I did. I did.

221
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:25,761
The answer is one in 18 million.

222
00:10:25,763 --> 00:10:27,662
What is?

223
00:10:27,665 --> 00:10:30,999
The odds of you
running into Mr. Watkins.

224
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,402
Oh, Shelly.
I have bad news.

225
00:10:33,403 --> 00:10:35,803
Mr. Watkins passed this morning.

226
00:10:35,806 --> 00:10:37,672
Oh.

227
00:10:37,675 --> 00:10:39,807
Oh, I'm-I'm sorry.

228
00:10:39,810 --> 00:10:42,244
I know.
What are the odds of that?

229
00:10:42,245 --> 00:10:44,513
Call you back.

230
00:10:52,845 --> 00:10:54,778
Now let's
calculate the amplitude!

231
00:10:54,781 --> 00:10:57,014
All right!

232
00:11:02,589 --> 00:11:05,824
Sheldon? Sheldon? Sheldon?

233
00:11:08,527 --> 00:11:11,061
It's annoying
when you do it.

234
00:11:11,064 --> 00:11:13,163
I brought pizza.

235
00:11:13,166 --> 00:11:14,699
Oh, thank you.

236
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:16,768
I have been working
pretty hard.

237
00:11:16,769 --> 00:11:18,036
I-I could use a break.

238
00:11:18,037 --> 00:11:19,537
What's that?

239
00:11:19,538 --> 00:11:21,572
Oh, yeah, that is an experiment

240
00:11:21,575 --> 00:11:24,142
to see how many parallelograms
I could draw

241
00:11:24,143 --> 00:11:26,110
while holding my breath.

242
00:11:27,214 --> 00:11:29,915
Is that where you blacked out?

243
00:11:29,917 --> 00:11:31,383
No, actually,

244
00:11:31,384 --> 00:11:34,551
that's where
I blacked out.

245
00:11:34,553 --> 00:11:35,954
And this?

246
00:11:35,955 --> 00:11:37,354
That is a list

247
00:11:37,356 --> 00:11:40,557
of all the different types
of natural disasters.

248
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,259
“Fire-quake”?

249
00:11:42,262 --> 00:11:44,763
I made that one up.

250
00:11:44,764 --> 00:11:48,399
Which I shouldn't have,
because now I'm scared of it.

251
00:11:48,402 --> 00:11:51,069
Hey, I thought you were
working on actual science.

252
00:11:51,071 --> 00:11:52,537
I am.

253
00:11:52,538 --> 00:11:54,973
I'm trying to come up with
a new approach to dark matter,

254
00:11:54,975 --> 00:11:56,807
but people keep
distracting me.

255
00:11:56,810 --> 00:11:59,444
First, my mother kept answering
the phone when I called,

256
00:11:59,446 --> 00:12:01,079
even though she knew I was busy.

257
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:03,915
And now you show up
with my favorite shape of food...

258
00:12:03,917 --> 00:12:08,219
a circle made of triangles
served in a square box.

259
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:10,021
Maybe I'll just eat this
in the laundry room.

260
00:12:10,023 --> 00:12:11,288
No, no. Wait.

261
00:12:11,291 --> 00:12:12,556
You don't have to go,

262
00:12:12,558 --> 00:12:14,926
as long as you sit quietly
and don't say anything.

263
00:12:14,927 --> 00:12:17,128
Fine.

264
00:12:22,369 --> 00:12:23,868
Mmm.

265
00:12:23,869 --> 00:12:26,370
Good.
Mmm.

266
00:12:29,142 --> 00:12:31,442
Are you mocking me?

267
00:12:36,416 --> 00:12:40,085
Hey, you want to hear
one of my geology songs?

268
00:12:40,086 --> 00:12:42,119
So it's about rocks?

269
00:12:42,122 --> 00:12:44,822
Better. It's about a boulder.

270
00:12:44,825 --> 00:12:46,725
Isn't that the same thing?

271
00:12:46,726 --> 00:12:48,158
Far from it.

272
00:12:48,161 --> 00:12:52,263
A boulder has a diameter
greater than 25.6 centimeters.

273
00:12:52,264 --> 00:12:54,199
Is that fact in the song?

274
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,332
No.

275
00:12:55,936 --> 00:12:57,835
Yes.

276
00:12:59,406 --> 00:13:01,439
It's sung from the viewpoint
of the boulder

277
00:13:01,441 --> 00:13:03,273
that chases Indiana Jones.

278
00:13:03,276 --> 00:13:05,542
That's right up our alley.
Let's hear it.

279
00:13:06,545 --> 00:13:07,543
Okay.

280
00:13:09,115 --> 00:13:13,218

281
00:13:14,454 --> 00:13:17,754

291
00:13:44,417 --> 00:13:46,050
So, I think if we want

292
00:13:46,051 --> 00:13:48,786
to predict the height
of the wave, we need to use

293
00:13:48,787 --> 00:13:51,221
elasticity theory
and model the lattice

294
00:13:51,224 --> 00:13:53,224
as one continuous
flexible piece.

295
00:13:53,225 --> 00:13:54,758
This is fun.
Mm-hmm.

296
00:13:54,761 --> 00:13:56,728
Playing with Popsicle sticks,

297
00:13:56,729 --> 00:13:59,096
exploring ways
to store kinetic energy.

298
00:13:59,099 --> 00:14:01,666
It's like preschool
all over again.

299
00:14:01,667 --> 00:14:04,402
Except now if I eat paste,
it's because I want to,

300
00:14:04,403 --> 00:14:07,404
not because
Craig Schultz is making me.

301
00:14:07,407 --> 00:14:09,840
Hey, can I ask you a question?

302
00:14:09,843 --> 00:14:11,375
Is it, “Where was the teacher?”

303
00:14:11,378 --> 00:14:14,445
She was in the bathroom smoking,
that's where.

304
00:14:14,446 --> 00:14:17,547
It wasn't, but I'm glad
to see you've moved on.

305
00:14:18,752 --> 00:14:21,585
I was gonna ask if being married
felt any different.

306
00:14:21,588 --> 00:14:25,156
Oh. Uh... not really.

307
00:14:25,157 --> 00:14:27,992
Sorry. That probably wasn't
the answer you were looking for.

308
00:14:27,994 --> 00:14:29,460
No, actually it is.

309
00:14:29,461 --> 00:14:32,729
I mean, Sheldon and I are in
a really great place right now,

310
00:14:32,731 --> 00:14:35,465
and I just, I don't want
anything to mess that up.

311
00:14:35,468 --> 00:14:37,534
Mm-hmm.
You do remember you're here

312
00:14:37,537 --> 00:14:40,604
because he kicked you
out of your apartment?

313
00:14:40,606 --> 00:14:41,938
Yes.

314
00:14:41,941 --> 00:14:43,907
His work is important to him.

315
00:14:43,909 --> 00:14:46,009
It's one of the
things I find

316
00:14:46,012 --> 00:14:47,412
the sexiest about him.

317
00:14:47,413 --> 00:14:50,013
Well, that and...
Aah!

318
00:14:55,488 --> 00:14:57,522
his butt.

319
00:14:59,959 --> 00:15:01,558
And then I was
thinking about

320
00:15:01,561 --> 00:15:03,628
inventing a new
dark matter particle

321
00:15:03,629 --> 00:15:05,529
to evade the omega
baryon constraints,

322
00:15:05,532 --> 00:15:07,165
but that just seems
like something

323
00:15:07,167 --> 00:15:08,766
anyone could
come up with.

324
00:15:08,768 --> 00:15:11,034
Mm. Agreed.

325
00:15:12,471 --> 00:15:14,404
You know
what's blowing my mind?

326
00:15:14,407 --> 00:15:19,109
Somebody thought about
putting cheese in this crust.

327
00:15:19,211 --> 00:15:23,648
I just wish I could find
something that excites me.

328
00:15:23,649 --> 00:15:25,749
You do understand
that crust doesn't normally

329
00:15:25,752 --> 00:15:27,384
come with cheese in it?

330
00:15:28,455 --> 00:15:30,287
Okay, all right, look.

331
00:15:30,290 --> 00:15:32,856
What got you excited about
dark matter in the first place?

332
00:15:32,859 --> 00:15:36,426
Well, I left
string theory,

333
00:15:36,428 --> 00:15:38,329
which I'd been working
on for a long time,

334
00:15:38,330 --> 00:15:40,898
and everyone was talking about
how cool dark matter was,

335
00:15:40,899 --> 00:15:44,067
and I thought, “Well, sure,
I'll give that a whirl”"

336
00:15:44,070 --> 00:15:47,638
So it's your rebound science?

337
00:15:47,639 --> 00:15:49,139
What's that?

338
00:15:49,142 --> 00:15:52,243
Well, not the science you spend
the rest of your life with,

339
00:15:52,244 --> 00:15:55,812
but the one you use to make
yourself feel pretty again.

340
00:15:57,484 --> 00:15:59,383
Well, if I'm being honest,

341
00:15:59,384 --> 00:16:01,451
I never forgot about
string theory.

342
00:16:01,454 --> 00:16:03,287
It's remarkable.

343
00:16:03,288 --> 00:16:05,723
It's the closest we've come
to a theory of everything,

344
00:16:05,725 --> 00:16:08,258
something even Einstein
couldn't figure out.

345
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:12,229
Well, if he couldn't figure
it out, maybe it's just wrong.

346
00:16:12,231 --> 00:16:13,898
But it's so elegant.

347
00:16:13,899 --> 00:16:17,502
I mean, look,
string theory posits

348
00:16:17,503 --> 00:16:20,104
that the fundamental particles
we see in three dimensions

349
00:16:20,105 --> 00:16:25,643
are actually strings embedded
in multidimensional space-time.

350
00:16:25,644 --> 00:16:29,412
Interesting.

351
00:16:29,415 --> 00:16:31,983
So that would mean...

352
00:16:31,984 --> 00:16:34,151
that...

353
00:16:35,488 --> 00:16:37,654
Can't do this by myself, buddy.

354
00:16:47,566 --> 00:16:50,534
What is happening?

355
00:16:50,537 --> 00:16:53,037
I was trying
not to wake you.

356
00:16:53,038 --> 00:16:55,406
Did it work?

357
00:16:55,407 --> 00:16:57,274
Sorry.

358
00:16:57,277 --> 00:16:59,009
I just realized,

359
00:16:59,012 --> 00:17:02,979
now that I'm not in the band,
I can focus on my own music.

360
00:17:02,981 --> 00:17:05,949
You know? Go solo.

361
00:17:05,952 --> 00:17:08,686
You said you were
taking a break from the band

362
00:17:08,687 --> 00:17:10,487
to help with me and the baby.

363
00:17:10,490 --> 00:17:14,090
Yes, and write
an astronaut musical.

364
00:17:14,092 --> 00:17:16,627
Picture this.
The curtain opens.

365
00:17:16,628 --> 00:17:18,696
There's a lone astronaut
floating

366
00:17:18,697 --> 00:17:20,398
in the inky blackness
of space.

367
00:17:20,399 --> 00:17:22,433
Maybe wires, maybe fog.

368
00:17:22,435 --> 00:17:24,702
I'll let the director
figure that out.

369
00:17:24,704 --> 00:17:29,040
♪ I really don't know when ♪

370
00:17:29,042 --> 00:17:34,779
♪ I'll run out of oxy... gen. ♪

371
00:17:36,381 --> 00:17:39,082
Good news!
I'm back in the band!

372
00:17:39,084 --> 00:17:41,452
So, Bernadette doesn't mind?

373
00:17:41,454 --> 00:17:43,387
It was her idea!

374
00:17:46,091 --> 00:17:49,025
So it's sort of like
a guitar string,

375
00:17:49,027 --> 00:17:50,994
but instead of making
an actual sound,

376
00:17:50,996 --> 00:17:53,196
each vibration is
a different particle.

377
00:17:53,198 --> 00:17:56,801
Precisely. And when
you express it in 11 dimensions,

378
00:17:56,802 --> 00:17:58,703
Einstein's relativity equations
pop out.

379
00:17:58,705 --> 00:18:00,338
Does that sound
like a coincidence?

380
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:02,138
It does not.
Yup.

381
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:04,375
That's what I think.

382
00:18:04,377 --> 00:18:07,677
So, so, did we do it?
Did we just solve string theory?

383
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:09,045
Oh.

384
00:18:09,048 --> 00:18:10,747
I appreciate
your enthusiasm,

385
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:12,617
but this is not
the sort of thing

386
00:18:12,619 --> 00:18:14,284
we can figure
out in a night.

387
00:18:14,286 --> 00:18:16,753
People have been
stuck on this for decades.

388
00:18:16,755 --> 00:18:18,089
Well, decades? Really?

389
00:18:18,090 --> 00:18:20,992
It's-it's a string.
How hard can it be?

390
00:18:21,927 --> 00:18:23,293
It's straight, it's in a loop,

391
00:18:23,295 --> 00:18:25,495
it gets knotted up
with other strings. Uh...

392
00:18:25,497 --> 00:18:27,263
Well, actually
there are no knots

393
00:18:27,265 --> 00:18:29,000
in anything greater
than four dimensions.

394
00:18:29,002 --> 00:18:31,101
Ooh, unless

395
00:18:31,103 --> 00:18:35,840
we get around that by
considering them as sheets.

396
00:18:35,841 --> 00:18:37,707
You know,
topologically speaking,

397
00:18:37,709 --> 00:18:40,910
that has a lot
of interesting possibilities.

398
00:18:40,913 --> 00:18:43,848
See? How long did that take me,
like a minute?

399
00:18:49,288 --> 00:18:50,588
Thought you were
getting us dinner.

400
00:18:50,590 --> 00:18:52,255
Sorry.
I had to stop at Sheldon's

401
00:18:52,257 --> 00:18:54,492
and help him solve
string theory.

402
00:18:58,930 --> 00:19:00,965
What?

403
00:19:00,966 --> 00:19:04,100
Yeah, turns out
the answer's knots.

404
00:19:04,102 --> 00:19:06,003
That's cute,
but you can't have knots

405
00:19:06,004 --> 00:19:07,471
in more than four dimensions.

406
00:19:07,473 --> 00:19:10,707
Mm, you can if
you consider them sheets.

407
00:19:10,709 --> 00:19:12,409
Good night.

408
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:27,340
What up,
my Hebrews and She-brews?

409
00:19:28,945 --> 00:19:31,446
We are Footprints
on the Moon.

410
00:19:32,482 --> 00:19:34,348
Toby, today you are a man,

411
00:19:34,350 --> 00:19:36,951
and you will face
many obstacles in life.

412
00:19:36,953 --> 00:19:40,987
And some of those obstacles
are gonna feel like boulders.

413
00:19:42,591 --> 00:19:45,626

the greatest boulder
