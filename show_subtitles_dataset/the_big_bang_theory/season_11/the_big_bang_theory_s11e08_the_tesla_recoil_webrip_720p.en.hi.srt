1
00:00:03,391 --> 00:00:04,670
Can we start the movie?

2
00:00:05,184 --> 00:00:06,917
Before Sheldon gets here?

3
00:00:06,919 --> 00:00:09,587
Last time we did that, he didn't
talk to us for a month.

4
00:00:09,589 --> 00:00:12,389
So do it!

5
00:00:12,392 --> 00:00:13,958
Hold on. Where is he?

6
00:00:13,959 --> 00:00:17,161
Well, according to his text,
he was on the second floor,

7
00:00:17,162 --> 00:00:19,964
then he stopped
to tie his shoe.

8
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:23,568
All tied, and...

9
00:00:23,569 --> 00:00:25,435
Hello!
Hi.

10
00:00:25,438 --> 00:00:26,871
Sorry we're late.

11
00:00:26,872 --> 00:00:30,341
Amy took forever
tying my shoe.

12
00:00:30,342 --> 00:00:31,609
All right!

13
00:00:31,610 --> 00:00:33,577
Who's excited
to see a documentary?

14
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:34,878
Oh, I know this one.

15
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:36,079
Nobody ever.

16
00:00:36,081 --> 00:00:38,448
Hey! This one's
going to be great.

17
00:00:38,450 --> 00:00:39,651
This is about the rivalry

18
00:00:39,652 --> 00:00:42,185
between a cool renegade
scientist, Nikola Tesla,

19
00:00:42,188 --> 00:00:44,554
and his arch-nemesis,
Thomas Edison.

20
00:00:44,557 --> 00:00:46,557
It's the greatest
scientific feud of all time.

21
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:49,426
I mean, you can forget
about Leibniz and Newton.

22
00:00:49,429 --> 00:00:50,795
Done.

23
00:00:50,797 --> 00:00:54,666
So, Tesla's the one
that invented the electric car?

24
00:00:56,069 --> 00:00:57,435
No, Penny.

25
00:00:57,436 --> 00:01:00,137
No, the car is just
named after him.

26
00:01:00,139 --> 00:01:01,838
Okay, you don't have to be
so smug about it.

27
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:03,474
You know, you went
to see that movie It

28
00:01:03,475 --> 00:01:06,109
because you thought
it was about scary I.T. guys.

29
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:11,382
Tesla was a genius who
invented our electrical grid.

30
00:01:11,383 --> 00:01:13,517
Edison just wanted to
get rich and famous.

31
00:01:13,519 --> 00:01:15,118
Didn't he invent the lightbulb?

32
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:16,787
That's what
he wants you to think.

33
00:01:16,790 --> 00:01:18,923
But without the foundational
work of Ebenezer Kinnersley,

34
00:01:18,924 --> 00:01:21,325
Warren de la Rue
and James Bowman Lindsay,

35
00:01:21,326 --> 00:01:23,427
you wouldn't know Edison
any more than you know

36
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:26,597
Ebenezer Kinnersley, Warren de
la Rue or James Bowman Lindsay.

37
00:01:27,466 --> 00:01:30,734
Isn't he sexy
all fired up?

38
00:01:30,736 --> 00:01:32,670
He really gets
my current alternating,

39
00:01:32,671 --> 00:01:35,306
if you know what I mean.

40
00:01:35,307 --> 00:01:38,308
Edison was kind of a
publicity hog and a bully.

41
00:01:38,311 --> 00:01:40,078
Yeah, he electrocuted
an elephant named Topsy

42
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:41,344
just to make himself famous.

43
00:01:41,347 --> 00:01:42,947
If I had an elephant
named Topsy,

44
00:01:42,948 --> 00:01:44,448
he would want for nothing.

45
00:01:45,617 --> 00:01:48,252
Also, he'd be named Jumbo.

46
00:01:48,253 --> 00:01:51,789
And worse than that, Edison
filmed the first on-screen kiss,

47
00:01:51,790 --> 00:01:55,126
so he's basically
a pornographer.

48
00:01:56,128 --> 00:01:57,861
Although every time
I put that in Wikipedia,

49
00:01:57,864 --> 00:02:00,965
someone takes it out.

50
00:02:00,966 --> 00:02:03,501
Is your current
still alternating?

51
00:02:03,502 --> 00:02:06,737
We're lucky there aren't
any elephants in here.

@elder_man

62
00:02:32,830 --> 00:02:34,698
You know, that documentary
last night was actually

63
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:35,870
better than I
thought it would be.

64
00:02:35,894 --> 00:02:37,001
Really?

65
00:02:37,002 --> 00:02:38,769
Should've been about
Samuel Morse

66
00:02:38,770 --> 00:02:41,572
the way they telegraphed
that ending.

67
00:02:41,573 --> 00:02:43,573
I already pretended to laugh
at that joke once.

68
00:02:43,575 --> 00:02:45,575
Do I have to do it again?

69
00:02:45,578 --> 00:02:48,044
Yeah, I'd appreciate it.

70
00:02:48,046 --> 00:02:51,748
Samuel Morse. You kill me.

71
00:02:53,885 --> 00:02:56,353
Leonard, can you
drive me to work?

72
00:02:56,354 --> 00:02:57,888
Yeah, sure.
Oh, hey, the guys and I

73
00:02:57,890 --> 00:02:59,590
were talking about
going to see the Tesla coil

74
00:02:59,592 --> 00:03:01,858
at the observatory later on,
if you want to join.

75
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:03,993
Oh, I'm sorry, I can't.
I'm busy.

76
00:03:03,996 --> 00:03:06,430
Why? What are you doing?
Leonard, what are you doing?

77
00:03:06,431 --> 00:03:09,231
He said he can't go.
Make a sad face, move on.

78
00:03:09,234 --> 00:03:11,200
It's fine.

79
00:03:11,203 --> 00:03:13,270
I couldn't tell you
even if I wanted to.

80
00:03:13,271 --> 00:03:14,737
What does that mean?
Leonard!

81
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:17,206
Sad face, sad face.

82
00:03:17,209 --> 00:03:20,176
I mean, I would like to,
but I just can't, you know,

83
00:03:20,179 --> 00:03:22,378
because it's classified
and top secret.

84
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:25,215
Hold on, are you still
working for the military?

85
00:03:25,217 --> 00:03:26,515
I'm so glad
you figured that out!

86
00:03:26,517 --> 00:03:28,685
It was killing me
keeping it a secret!

87
00:03:28,687 --> 00:03:30,319
I thought they
fired you guys.

88
00:03:30,322 --> 00:03:32,455
They did,
but then they hired me back.

89
00:03:32,457 --> 00:03:34,323
Well, you better not be
working on our project,

90
00:03:34,325 --> 00:03:35,459
because we're a team.

91
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:38,628
Leonard, there is
no "I" in team.

92
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:40,030
However,
there is an "I" in

93
00:03:40,032 --> 00:03:43,667
"I'm working with the military
and you're not."

94
00:03:43,669 --> 00:03:45,868
There's five of them, in fact.

95
00:03:49,174 --> 00:03:51,008
Hey, hey.

96
00:03:51,009 --> 00:03:52,709
I got a big surprise for you.

97
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:54,878
Is it pie and ice cream?

98
00:03:55,914 --> 00:03:57,681
Wow, did I oversell it.

99
00:03:57,682 --> 00:03:59,349
It's Raj and Ruchi!

100
00:03:59,350 --> 00:04:00,950
Hello.

101
00:04:00,953 --> 00:04:02,185
Hey. Hi.

102
00:04:02,187 --> 00:04:03,453
Hey, what are
you two doing here?

103
00:04:03,455 --> 00:04:04,487
We won't stay long.

104
00:04:04,490 --> 00:04:06,156
I just wanted
to drop something off

105
00:04:06,157 --> 00:04:07,723
from me and the girls at work.

106
00:04:07,725 --> 00:04:10,760
None of the girls at work
like me enough to get me a gift.

107
00:04:10,763 --> 00:04:12,763
Okay, so you'll know
why everyone at the office

108
00:04:12,765 --> 00:04:14,431
has the same handwriting.

109
00:04:14,432 --> 00:04:16,932
I really appreciate
the thought,

110
00:04:16,935 --> 00:04:19,335
but it's not necessary.
I'll be back soon.

111
00:04:19,337 --> 00:04:22,104
Don't worry about work.
You take all the time you need.

112
00:04:22,106 --> 00:04:23,873
Yeah, just turn
off your brain

113
00:04:23,876 --> 00:04:26,243
and let your uterus
do its magic.

114
00:04:28,179 --> 00:04:30,380
It's the star
of the show now.

115
00:04:31,849 --> 00:04:34,450
Okay, wasn't sure how long
I should let you guys stay.

116
00:04:34,453 --> 00:04:37,020
Now I know!
Get out!

117
00:04:37,022 --> 00:04:39,088
Good to see you.
You look amazing.

118
00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:40,991
Thanks for coming!

119
00:04:41,993 --> 00:04:44,727
That bitch.

120
00:04:44,729 --> 00:04:46,796
Oh, come on, he means well.

121
00:04:46,799 --> 00:04:49,799
He's just trying
to impress his girlfriend.

122
00:04:49,801 --> 00:04:51,835
I'm talking about Ruchi.

123
00:04:51,837 --> 00:04:53,335
She's after my job.

124
00:04:53,337 --> 00:04:56,272
Why do you think she said,
"Take all the time you need"?

125
00:04:56,275 --> 00:04:58,875
Because she was being nice?

126
00:04:58,876 --> 00:05:01,945
No, she's trying to steal
my projects while I'm at home

127
00:05:01,946 --> 00:05:05,715
taking care of this useless
plant and my dumb family.

128
00:05:05,717 --> 00:05:09,419
I'm only saying this
because I love you

129
00:05:09,421 --> 00:05:11,655
and because you can't
reach me from that bed,

130
00:05:11,657 --> 00:05:13,856
but you sound a little crazy.

131
00:05:13,859 --> 00:05:17,059
I love you, too, but I could
fling this card in your eye

132
00:05:17,061 --> 00:05:19,962
like a ninja throwing star.

133
00:05:19,965 --> 00:05:21,765
I don't believe you.

134
00:05:27,405 --> 00:05:30,039
Why would the military
want Sheldon?

135
00:05:30,042 --> 00:05:33,409
I don't know. Target practice?

136
00:05:33,412 --> 00:05:36,313
Well, he better not be
working on our guidance system.

137
00:05:36,314 --> 00:05:37,813
That was my idea.

138
00:05:37,816 --> 00:05:39,181
Why don't we call
Colonel Williams

139
00:05:39,183 --> 00:05:40,851
and find out
what's going on.

140
00:05:40,852 --> 00:05:43,886
Great. I want answers
and he'd better give them to us.

141
00:05:46,291 --> 00:05:47,424
Hello, gentlemen.

142
00:05:47,426 --> 00:05:50,527
Hi, sir.
Um, Leonard has a question.

143
00:05:52,563 --> 00:05:55,564
Hey, is Sheldon working on
our project again?

144
00:05:55,566 --> 00:05:57,066
Did he say that?

145
00:05:57,068 --> 00:05:58,335
No, he wouldn't tell us.

146
00:05:58,337 --> 00:06:03,039
Huh. So he can
keep his mouth shut.

147
00:06:03,041 --> 00:06:05,142
How do I get him to do that?

148
00:06:05,143 --> 00:06:08,811
Is he working on
our guidance system or not?

149
00:06:08,813 --> 00:06:11,948
Dr. Cooper contacted us
with an idea on how to modify

150
00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:14,484
your technology into
a communication system,

151
00:06:14,486 --> 00:06:15,885
and it seemed interesting.

152
00:06:15,888 --> 00:06:19,489
But our team developed
that technology.

153
00:06:19,491 --> 00:06:21,090
And he was your team leader.

154
00:06:21,092 --> 00:06:22,726
Well, who said
he was team leader?

155
00:06:22,727 --> 00:06:24,126
He did.

156
00:06:25,097 --> 00:06:27,731
And I like that kind of
"take charge" attitude.

157
00:06:27,732 --> 00:06:29,933
We can have "take
charge" attitudes.

158
00:06:29,934 --> 00:06:32,469
Then why didn't either of you
ask to be team leader?

159
00:06:32,470 --> 00:06:35,070
We didn't want to step
on anyone's toes.

160
00:06:35,073 --> 00:06:36,939
Yeah, so we were just

161
00:06:36,941 --> 00:06:41,044
waiting for you to tell us who
you thought— Okay, I hear it.

162
00:06:42,847 --> 00:06:44,748
- Are we done?
- No, no.

163
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:47,517
I am taking charge right
now and telling you

164
00:06:47,518 --> 00:06:48,984
that it is not okay
with us if...

165
00:06:48,986 --> 00:06:51,787
Okay, bye.

166
00:06:54,926 --> 00:06:57,327
Hey. I just got your text.
Everything okay?

167
00:06:57,328 --> 00:07:00,130
Yeah, there's just something
I need to ask you.

168
00:07:00,131 --> 00:07:02,899
Oh, Bernie,
I'd be thrilled.

169
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:05,068
It's not be my birth coach.

170
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:08,671
Okay, that hurts, but luckily I
know how to breathe through it.

171
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:15,578
I need you to find out
if Ruchi's trying to steal

172
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:17,714
my projects at work
while I'm on bed rest.

173
00:07:17,715 --> 00:07:20,417
She's not that
kind of a person.

174
00:07:20,419 --> 00:07:23,219
She's-she's generous
and charitable.

175
00:07:23,222 --> 00:07:25,322
You're just saying that
'cause she's sleeping with you.

176
00:07:25,323 --> 00:07:27,857
Yes, that's my favorite charity.

177
00:07:27,859 --> 00:07:32,796
I know I sound paranoid, but
I'm feeling really vulnerable.

178
00:07:32,798 --> 00:07:35,198
If there's anything you could
find out, it'd be great.

179
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:39,236
And if she is up to anything,
what are you gonna do?

180
00:07:39,237 --> 00:07:40,736
Nothing.

181
00:07:40,739 --> 00:07:42,438
I'll just calmly
talk to her and explain

182
00:07:42,441 --> 00:07:44,941
there are certain boundaries
that need to be respected.

183
00:07:44,943 --> 00:07:48,945
It's really for the benefit
of everyone at the company.

184
00:07:50,782 --> 00:07:54,083
Uh, okay, what you're saying
sounds nice,

185
00:07:54,085 --> 00:07:55,684
but the way you're saying it

186
00:07:55,686 --> 00:07:59,421
is causing my testicles
to take cover in my abdomen.

187
00:08:01,792 --> 00:08:03,727
What do you want to watch?

188
00:08:03,729 --> 00:08:05,328
Oh, why don't you pick.

189
00:08:05,330 --> 00:08:07,229
Okay, how about comedy?

190
00:08:07,231 --> 00:08:10,032
Eh, I already laughed today.

191
00:08:10,034 --> 00:08:14,169
I know. It was when
I stubbed my toe.

192
00:08:14,171 --> 00:08:16,071
Still funny.

193
00:08:16,073 --> 00:08:18,407
Drama?

194
00:08:18,409 --> 00:08:20,477
Nah, I've already
seen someone cry today.

195
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:22,645
It really hurt, Sheldon!

196
00:08:23,815 --> 00:08:25,381
Hey.

197
00:08:25,383 --> 00:08:27,150
We talked to
Colonel Williams.

198
00:08:27,152 --> 00:08:28,417
He told us everything.

199
00:08:28,419 --> 00:08:30,020
I'm sorry, can we do this
another time?

200
00:08:30,022 --> 00:08:34,156
Amy's just about to realize she
wants to watch a Hulk marathon.

201
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:35,491
What's going on?

202
00:08:35,493 --> 00:08:38,461
Sheldon went to the Air
Force behind our backs.

203
00:08:38,462 --> 00:08:40,096
I did nothing of the sort.

204
00:08:40,097 --> 00:08:41,463
I had an idea

205
00:08:41,466 --> 00:08:43,198
for a neutrino-based
communication system,

206
00:08:43,201 --> 00:08:45,868
I presented it to them,
and they were interested.

207
00:08:45,871 --> 00:08:47,804
But y-your
communication system

208
00:08:47,805 --> 00:08:49,905
was based on our
guidance system.

209
00:08:49,908 --> 00:08:51,775
And sonar is based on bats.

210
00:08:51,776 --> 00:08:53,677
You don't see them
hanging upside down

211
00:08:53,679 --> 00:08:55,812
in a patent attorney's office.

212
00:08:55,813 --> 00:08:59,082
You know what, you like to think
that you're just like Tesla,

213
00:08:59,083 --> 00:09:01,451
but the truth is
you're exactly like Edison.

214
00:09:01,453 --> 00:09:02,885
You take that back.

215
00:09:02,887 --> 00:09:04,821
No, he's right.

216
00:09:04,823 --> 00:09:08,290
You are a bully, a credit
hog and a self-promoter.

217
00:09:08,293 --> 00:09:13,029
And if anyone around here
is like Tesla, it's us.

218
00:09:15,199 --> 00:09:17,366
Yeah.

219
00:09:20,072 --> 00:09:22,871
Can you believe they said
I was just like Edison?

220
00:09:22,874 --> 00:09:25,808
Yeah, and in front of
a lady, no less.

221
00:09:25,810 --> 00:09:27,910
Well, you are
building on their work

222
00:09:27,913 --> 00:09:29,411
and taking the
credit for it.

223
00:09:29,414 --> 00:09:30,847
That's a classic
Edison move.

224
00:09:30,848 --> 00:09:32,615
Oh, yeah?

225
00:09:32,616 --> 00:09:34,650
Well, if I'm Edison
and you love me,

226
00:09:34,653 --> 00:09:36,586
then what does that say
about you?

227
00:09:36,587 --> 00:09:38,320
I honestly don't know.

228
00:09:38,323 --> 00:09:40,089
Okay.

229
00:09:40,092 --> 00:09:42,391
Well, I have to Google
some stuff about Mrs. Edison.

230
00:09:42,394 --> 00:09:44,560
I'll be right back.

231
00:09:47,929 --> 00:09:49,328
You know whose fault this is?

232
00:09:49,329 --> 00:09:50,295
I do.

233
00:09:50,298 --> 00:09:51,898
Yours.

234
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:54,100
No, my mother's.

235
00:09:54,102 --> 00:09:56,669
"Go make friends, Sheldon."

236
00:09:57,539 --> 00:09:58,637
What happens?

237
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,640
20 years later,
they call me names.

238
00:10:00,641 --> 00:10:04,544
I don't think what they
called you is the point here.

239
00:10:04,545 --> 00:10:06,611
Oh, yeah?
How would you feel

240
00:10:06,613 --> 00:10:09,848
if I called you the name of a
neuroscientist you didn't like?

241
00:10:09,851 --> 00:10:12,184
Do you know the name
of any neuroscientist?

242
00:10:12,187 --> 00:10:13,653
Of course.

243
00:10:13,655 --> 00:10:14,986
Not me?

244
00:10:14,988 --> 00:10:18,390
Then no.

245
00:10:18,393 --> 00:10:21,193
Do you think they're right, Amy?

246
00:10:22,362 --> 00:10:25,063
Do you think I'm like Edison?

247
00:10:25,066 --> 00:10:29,001
Sheldon, I don't
think you're upset

248
00:10:29,002 --> 00:10:32,170
because of what kind of
scientist they said you're like.

249
00:10:32,173 --> 00:10:33,838
I think you're
upset because

250
00:10:33,841 --> 00:10:35,908
your friend"
feelings got hurt.

251
00:10:35,909 --> 00:10:39,078
You're right.

252
00:10:39,079 --> 00:10:42,081
I care too much about
other people's feelings.

253
00:10:43,617 --> 00:10:46,385
It's always been my fatal flaw.

254
00:10:46,386 --> 00:10:49,020
Sheldon, I
don't think...

255
00:10:49,023 --> 00:10:51,823
No, no, not now, Amy.
I'm growing as a person.

256
00:10:54,194 --> 00:10:56,962
Ah, that was fun.

257
00:10:56,964 --> 00:10:59,631
Put her there, buddy.

258
00:10:59,634 --> 00:11:02,968
I am not fist bumping
you after we have sex.

259
00:11:02,971 --> 00:11:05,670
You're the one who wanted
to keep things casual.

260
00:11:05,673 --> 00:11:08,274
There's a difference
between casual and weird.

261
00:11:08,275 --> 00:11:10,576
Not the way I do it.

262
00:11:12,413 --> 00:11:16,082
So, um... how was,
how was your day?

263
00:11:16,083 --> 00:11:18,284
Like, how's-how's work?

264
00:11:18,285 --> 00:11:19,784
Oh, great.

265
00:11:19,786 --> 00:11:21,187
With Bernadette gone,

266
00:11:21,188 --> 00:11:23,521
I'm getting to handle
all her projects.

267
00:11:23,524 --> 00:11:25,191
Well, she's-she's not gone.

268
00:11:25,193 --> 00:11:26,659
She'll be back soon.

269
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:29,794
Not too soon, let's hope.

270
00:11:31,164 --> 00:11:33,499
So it turns out Ruchi is totally

271
00:11:33,501 --> 00:11:35,233
trying to take over
Bernadette's projects.

272
00:11:35,236 --> 00:11:37,303
Wow, she just told you
that out of the blue?

273
00:11:37,304 --> 00:11:39,105
Yeah, yeah,
we had just made love.

274
00:11:39,106 --> 00:11:41,140
It was so beautiful.

275
00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:43,608
Our caramel-colored bodies

276
00:11:43,611 --> 00:11:46,044
were entwined like
erotic taffy...

277
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:47,880
Get to the point!
Oh.

278
00:11:47,881 --> 00:11:49,515
Uh, sorry, uh, yeah.

279
00:11:49,516 --> 00:11:52,083
I-I asked her about work,
and she just admitted

280
00:11:52,086 --> 00:11:54,120
she has her eyes
on Bernadette's projects.

281
00:11:54,121 --> 00:11:55,288
Can't believe she
would take advantage

282
00:11:55,289 --> 00:11:56,554
of a pregnant
lady like that.

283
00:11:56,557 --> 00:11:57,656
So what did you do?

284
00:11:57,659 --> 00:11:59,125
What do you think I did?

285
00:11:59,126 --> 00:12:02,395
I made small talk for 20 minutes
and had sex again.

286
00:12:02,396 --> 00:12:04,929
You have to say
something to Bernie.

287
00:12:04,932 --> 00:12:07,265
I don't know. If I do that,
she's gonna confront Ruchi,

288
00:12:07,268 --> 00:12:09,635
and then Ruchi's gonna
stop sleeping with me.

289
00:12:09,636 --> 00:12:11,337
Raj, you can't go on
sleeping with a woman

290
00:12:11,338 --> 00:12:12,704
who's trying to screw
over your friend.

291
00:12:12,707 --> 00:12:15,975
Can't or must?

292
00:12:18,346 --> 00:12:20,413
You know, that guidance system
was my idea.

293
00:12:20,414 --> 00:12:21,713
You figured out
how to make it work.

294
00:12:21,716 --> 00:12:23,115
We didn't even need Sheldon.

295
00:12:23,116 --> 00:12:25,951
Let's not forget your idea
was based on my theory.

296
00:12:25,953 --> 00:12:29,587
Hey, we're bagging
on Sheldon here! Focus!

297
00:12:30,757 --> 00:12:33,726
I guess it was pretty smart
using our quantum technology

298
00:12:33,727 --> 00:12:35,727
as the basis for
a communication system.

299
00:12:35,730 --> 00:12:38,664
Be even better if he swapped out
the helium for xenon.

300
00:12:38,665 --> 00:12:42,367
Ooh. So instead of having to
keep it at negative 271 degrees,

301
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:44,470
you'd only have to keep it
at negative 108.

302
00:12:44,472 --> 00:12:45,837
It would be way more efficient.

303
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:47,939
And xenon has a bigger nucleus,

304
00:12:47,942 --> 00:12:50,742
so coherence would make it
an easier signal to see.

305
00:12:50,745 --> 00:12:51,977
You're brilliant!

306
00:12:51,978 --> 00:12:53,011
We should tell Sheldon.

307
00:12:53,014 --> 00:12:54,612
You're an idiot!

308
00:12:55,582 --> 00:12:56,749
We don't tell Sheldon.

309
00:12:56,751 --> 00:12:58,317
We go to the military
behind his back

310
00:12:58,318 --> 00:13:00,352
and we screw him
like he screwed us.

311
00:13:00,355 --> 00:13:01,754
All right, you're right,
you're right, we don't need him.

312
00:13:01,755 --> 00:13:02,887
We can do this all on our own.

313
00:13:02,890 --> 00:13:03,846
Do you think
you can do the math?

314
00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:05,097
No.

315
00:13:07,194 --> 00:13:08,394
But if someone else does it,

316
00:13:08,395 --> 00:13:11,797
I can double check
the crap out of it.

317
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,068
I want you to know,
I did what you asked.

318
00:13:16,069 --> 00:13:19,004
I talked to Ruchi and found out
what's going on at work.

319
00:13:19,005 --> 00:13:21,039
So is she trying
to steal my projects?

320
00:13:21,041 --> 00:13:22,842
No, not trying to,
sounds like it's a done deal.

321
00:13:22,843 --> 00:13:24,009
Here, have a brownie.

322
00:13:24,010 --> 00:13:26,245
I'm gonna kill her.

323
00:13:26,246 --> 00:13:28,113
Okay, don't take this
out on Ruchi.

324
00:13:28,116 --> 00:13:30,216
Is she trying to
take your job? Yes.

325
00:13:30,217 --> 00:13:31,717
Is she parking
in your space? Yes.

326
00:13:31,718 --> 00:13:33,752
Did she get a laugh
at a meeting yesterday

327
00:13:33,755 --> 00:13:36,054
by calling you "Pregnadette"?
Big one.

328
00:13:37,424 --> 00:13:40,860
But you would've done the exact
same thing, and you know it.

329
00:13:40,861 --> 00:13:43,261
I never would've
undermined a coworker.

330
00:13:43,264 --> 00:13:45,463
What? Oh, please.
Wh-What about that guy Eric,

331
00:13:45,466 --> 00:13:48,134
who you told it was
"Bring Your Cat to Work Day"

332
00:13:48,135 --> 00:13:50,935
when you knew
your boss had asthma?

333
00:13:50,938 --> 00:13:53,239
That was just a hilarious prank

334
00:13:53,241 --> 00:13:56,741
that ended with me
getting a corner office.

335
00:13:56,743 --> 00:13:58,743
All I'm saying is

336
00:13:58,746 --> 00:14:00,346
before you attack Ruchi,
maybe you should

337
00:14:00,347 --> 00:14:02,280
take a long hard look
in the mirror,

338
00:14:02,283 --> 00:14:03,716
because you know
what you'll see—

339
00:14:03,717 --> 00:14:06,284
apart from radiant skin
and luxuriously thick hair?

340
00:14:06,286 --> 00:14:07,786
Hypocrisy!

341
00:14:13,394 --> 00:14:16,395
It is thick.

342
00:14:17,564 --> 00:14:19,832
So what do you think?
Can you make it work?

343
00:14:19,833 --> 00:14:22,001
Uh, I just need to
use the cross section

344
00:14:22,002 --> 00:14:24,669
to calculate the probability
of the interaction.

345
00:14:24,672 --> 00:14:26,071
Can we help?

346
00:14:26,073 --> 00:14:27,405
Yes.

347
00:14:27,408 --> 00:14:30,141
Why don't you run
get me a can of Pringles.

348
00:14:32,179 --> 00:14:33,446
Leonard, I was—

349
00:14:33,448 --> 00:14:36,015
What's Kripke doing here?

350
00:14:36,016 --> 00:14:38,150
Oh, he's just helping us
develop a better, more efficient

351
00:14:38,151 --> 00:14:40,352
neutrino comm system that we're
gonna pitch to the military,

352
00:14:40,353 --> 00:14:41,520
making yours obsolete.

353
00:14:41,521 --> 00:14:42,621
Yeah,
Leonard thought of it.

354
00:14:42,622 --> 00:14:44,055
It's genius.
Oh, thanks.

355
00:14:44,058 --> 00:14:45,890
You see, instead of
using liquid helium...

356
00:14:45,893 --> 00:14:48,193
Good God, man, shut up!
Right, sorry.

357
00:14:48,195 --> 00:14:49,661
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

358
00:14:49,664 --> 00:14:51,831
You didn't tell me
we were doing this

359
00:14:51,832 --> 00:14:53,299
just to stick it to Sheldon.

360
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:55,034
Oh, well...

361
00:14:55,035 --> 00:14:58,437
I messing with you. This sundae
just got a cherry on top!

362
00:14:59,774 --> 00:15:02,507
Fine. Good luck to you.

363
00:15:02,510 --> 00:15:04,577
The military is already
interested in my system,

364
00:15:04,578 --> 00:15:06,078
and my math is worked out.

365
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:07,780
His still has a big gap in it.

366
00:15:07,781 --> 00:15:09,113
Where?

367
00:15:09,951 --> 00:15:11,784
There.

368
00:15:15,155 --> 00:15:17,823
— Can I ask you a question?
Mm?

369
00:15:17,824 --> 00:15:20,458
Does a drug still count
as an antidepressant

370
00:15:20,461 --> 00:15:24,663
if its number one side effect
is uncontrollable weeping?

371
00:15:24,664 --> 00:15:29,268
I don't know. I always feel
better after a good cry.

372
00:15:29,270 --> 00:15:30,769
I've been trying
to ask Bernadette,

373
00:15:30,770 --> 00:15:33,338
but she's not answering
any of my texts.

374
00:15:33,341 --> 00:15:35,441
Yeah, uh, listen,
I think she might be

375
00:15:35,443 --> 00:15:37,275
a little threatened
by you, you know,

376
00:15:37,278 --> 00:15:40,545
because you can tie your own
shoes and laugh without peeing.

377
00:15:40,548 --> 00:15:42,515
Did she say something to you?

378
00:15:42,516 --> 00:15:44,049
No.

379
00:15:44,050 --> 00:15:45,784
I mean, well, kind of.

380
00:15:45,785 --> 00:15:47,285
But it's okay.
She's just hormonal.

381
00:15:47,288 --> 00:15:49,355
And, you know, don't worry,
I stood up for you.

382
00:15:49,356 --> 00:15:51,924
I don't need you
to stand up for me.

383
00:15:51,925 --> 00:15:53,324
You're not my boyfriend.

384
00:15:53,327 --> 00:15:55,461
Look, I care about you,

385
00:15:55,462 --> 00:15:58,163
and you can say that
this doesn't mean anything,

386
00:15:58,164 --> 00:15:59,932
but the truth is we're in
a relationship, okay?

387
00:15:59,933 --> 00:16:02,601
And you're gonna have to figure
out some way to deal with it.

388
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:07,606
I can't believe
she dumped me.

389
00:16:07,607 --> 00:16:10,174
This is tough for
me, 'cause I can.

390
00:16:15,116 --> 00:16:18,116
Sorry things worked
out like that.

391
00:16:18,118 --> 00:16:21,386
Because I'm in pain or because
you don't have a spy anymore?

392
00:16:21,389 --> 00:16:23,021
Let's just leave
it at "I'm sorry."

393
00:16:23,024 --> 00:16:25,957
You're already sad.

394
00:16:27,127 --> 00:16:29,227
Based on Kripke's
calculations,

395
00:16:29,230 --> 00:16:30,895
I think this
is gonna work.

396
00:16:30,898 --> 00:16:32,831
Maybe we should pitch it
to Colonel Williams today.

397
00:16:32,832 --> 00:16:34,900
Why limit ourselves
to the U.S. military?

398
00:16:34,901 --> 00:16:37,502
I bet there's a lot of
other places we could take this.

399
00:16:37,505 --> 00:16:39,871
Without committing
criminal espionage?

400
00:16:39,874 --> 00:16:42,775
You know, it's easy
to shoot an idea down, Leonard.

401
00:16:44,278 --> 00:16:47,246
Well, I suppose
congratulations are in order.

402
00:16:47,247 --> 00:16:50,249
You set out to destroy me,
and you achieved your goal.

403
00:16:50,251 --> 00:16:51,382
What are you talking about?

404
00:16:51,385 --> 00:16:53,151
The military
canceled my project,

405
00:16:53,154 --> 00:16:54,919
because they're
going with yours.

406
00:16:54,922 --> 00:16:58,222
That's impossible.
We haven't even pitched it yet.

407
00:16:58,225 --> 00:17:00,259
Well, Colonel Williams said
another team at Caltech

408
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:02,727
came up with a more efficient
neutrino comm system.

409
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:03,929
Damn it!

410
00:17:05,466 --> 00:17:07,532
Excuse us.

411
00:17:07,535 --> 00:17:09,201
Kripke.

412
00:17:09,203 --> 00:17:11,436
What's up, fellas?

413
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:12,738
Did you screw us over?

414
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:14,472
Ooh, I can't tell you that.

415
00:17:14,474 --> 00:17:16,308
It's classified.

416
00:17:20,936 --> 00:17:23,470
Why did you tell
Barry Kripke your idea?

417
00:17:23,472 --> 00:17:24,837
This is all your fault.

418
00:17:24,839 --> 00:17:26,072
No, it's your fault.

419
00:17:26,075 --> 00:17:27,741
If you would've come to us
in the beginning,

420
00:17:27,742 --> 00:17:29,242
none of this would've happened.

421
00:17:29,244 --> 00:17:31,045
Well, if it helps,
you all behaved terribly

422
00:17:31,047 --> 00:17:32,980
and you deserve
what you got.

423
00:17:32,981 --> 00:17:35,715
Well, that doesn't help at all.

424
00:17:35,718 --> 00:17:38,953
You know, sometimes your
social skills are very poor.

425
00:17:40,021 --> 00:17:43,723
Can't believe we let
Kripke use us like that.

426
00:17:43,725 --> 00:17:45,759
You know, maybe you're all
more like the guy

427
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:48,362
who didn't invent
the electric car

428
00:17:48,364 --> 00:17:53,166
and less like the guy
who didn't invent the lightbulb.

429
00:17:56,271 --> 00:18:00,540
She's right. Maybe we're all
a bunch of Teslas after all.

430
00:18:00,542 --> 00:18:03,911
Didn't Tesla die penniless,
forgotten and insane?

431
00:18:03,913 --> 00:18:07,280
You may have a point
about her social skills.

432
00:18:08,216 --> 00:18:09,583
He wasn't insane.

433
00:18:09,585 --> 00:18:11,985
He did fall in love
with a pigeon.

434
00:18:11,988 --> 00:18:13,487
Well, if we're gonna
call Tesla crazy

435
00:18:13,489 --> 00:18:15,254
for loving something
small and unappealing,

436
00:18:15,257 --> 00:18:17,523
might as well put Penny
in a padded cell right now.
