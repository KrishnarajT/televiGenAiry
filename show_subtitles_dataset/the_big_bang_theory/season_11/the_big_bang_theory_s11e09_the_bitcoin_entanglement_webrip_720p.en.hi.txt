1
00:00:04,777 --> 00:00:08,311
Why are they making
four more Avatar movies?

2
00:00:08,314 --> 00:00:10,715
It's not like the first one
is even that good.

3
00:00:10,716 --> 00:00:13,083
What are you talking about?
You love that movie.

4
00:00:13,086 --> 00:00:15,086
You even went as Avatar
for Halloween.

5
00:00:15,087 --> 00:00:19,222
I remember. That was
not a lot of clothes.

6
00:00:19,225 --> 00:00:21,225
Hey, guys.

7
00:00:21,227 --> 00:00:22,559
- Hey.
- Hey.

8
00:00:22,562 --> 00:00:25,596
I'm, uh, I'm running
a special today, uh,

9
00:00:25,597 --> 00:00:29,265
buy something, keep having
a comic book store to come to.

10
00:00:29,268 --> 00:00:31,234
This is awkward.

11
00:00:31,236 --> 00:00:33,070
I was actually gonna
return this.

12
00:00:33,071 --> 00:00:34,771
What's wrong with it?

13
00:00:34,774 --> 00:00:36,640
I-I finished it.

14
00:00:37,576 --> 00:00:41,045
Speaking of something
I find interesting,

15
00:00:41,046 --> 00:00:43,948
did anyone read that article
about Bitcoin I sent you?

16
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:45,850
Yeah, I can't believe
a single Bitcoin

17
00:00:45,851 --> 00:00:48,252
is worth about $5,000 now.

18
00:00:48,253 --> 00:00:51,956
Wait, didn't we mine some
a few years ago?

19
00:00:51,957 --> 00:00:54,091
It was seven years ago.

20
00:00:54,092 --> 00:00:56,527
Oh, yeah, I remember that.

21
00:00:56,528 --> 00:00:58,496
Really? All I can remember
from seven years ago

22
00:00:58,497 --> 00:01:02,232
is I couldn't get Kesha's
"Tik Tok" out of my head.

23
00:01:02,234 --> 00:01:05,936
♪ Tik Tok, on the clock... ♪
Whoa, welcome home, Kesha.

24
00:01:07,372 --> 00:01:08,872
No, we-we definitely mined some.

25
00:01:08,874 --> 00:01:11,509
I-I remember sitting in your
bedroom and writing the program.

26
00:01:11,511 --> 00:01:13,676
I think we ended up
with a bunch of it.

27
00:01:13,678 --> 00:01:17,014
Wow, and at, like,
$5,000 apiece, that's...

28
00:01:17,015 --> 00:01:20,484
Sounds like a lot of money,
which we agreed to share

29
00:01:20,485 --> 00:01:24,053
'cause I-I was totally there.
I remember now.

30
00:01:25,124 --> 00:01:27,324
I can't believe
we forgot about it.

31
00:01:27,326 --> 00:01:28,392
It's not that surprising.

32
00:01:28,393 --> 00:01:30,226
They were basically worthless
when we got them.

33
00:01:30,229 --> 00:01:32,496
I wish I knew
how much we had.

34
00:01:32,497 --> 00:01:34,098
Sheldon,
you must remember.

35
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:35,565
Of course I do.

36
00:01:35,568 --> 00:01:37,934
Oh, yeah, he and I
totally remember.

37
00:01:38,737 --> 00:01:41,237
You tell them, Sheldon.

38
00:01:42,475 --> 00:01:45,609
I can't believe you haven't
seen Avatar yet.

39
00:01:45,610 --> 00:01:46,944
What is wrong with you?

40
00:01:46,945 --> 00:01:48,479
Penny and I just started dating,

41
00:01:48,481 --> 00:01:50,380
and you know
I don't like big crowds.

42
00:01:50,383 --> 00:01:52,616
Because you're afraid Penny will
leave you for someone in them?

43
00:01:52,618 --> 00:01:54,151
Terrified.

44
00:01:55,253 --> 00:01:56,653
Yes, instead of going out,

45
00:01:56,655 --> 00:01:59,155
they just stay home
and have constant coitus.

46
00:01:59,158 --> 00:02:03,928
Well, I didn't want to say it,
but I-I do like to hear it.

47
00:02:04,764 --> 00:02:08,499
Yes, Ma, I'll be
home for dinner.

48
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:12,336
No, I'm not ruining
my appetite with candy.

49
00:02:13,206 --> 00:02:15,105
Oh, we're having brisket?

50
00:02:15,106 --> 00:02:16,640
Be home at 6:00.

51
00:02:18,778 --> 00:02:20,044
Maybe we should double date.

52
00:02:20,045 --> 00:02:22,278
I'll bring Penny
and you can bring your mom.

53
00:02:23,315 --> 00:02:24,481
Oh, make your jokes,

54
00:02:24,484 --> 00:02:26,217
but my date started
a savings account for me.

55
00:02:26,218 --> 00:02:27,417
Did yours?

56
00:02:29,154 --> 00:02:30,653
- Hey, you guys.
- Hey.

57
00:02:30,655 --> 00:02:32,021
Oh, Stuart, good.
I was wondering,

58
00:02:32,023 --> 00:02:33,857
will you be accepting Bitcoin?

59
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:37,061
Well, I don't know what that is,
but it's got "coin" in it,

60
00:02:37,063 --> 00:02:42,131
and my cash register doesn't,
so... yeah.

61
00:02:42,868 --> 00:02:44,367
Wait, what's Bitcoin?

62
00:02:44,369 --> 00:02:47,004
It's a new online currency
that's been developed.

63
00:02:47,005 --> 00:02:48,939
Uh, it's just like
actual money,

64
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:52,408
except you can't see it, hold
it, or spend it on anything.

65
00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:55,778
Sounds like the kind of money
I'm familiar with.

66
00:02:57,850 --> 00:02:59,617
If it's not tangible,
how do you know

67
00:02:59,618 --> 00:03:01,718
it's not just gonna
vanish tomorrow?

68
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:03,786
Really? You're dating Penny, and
you're gonna poke at something

69
00:03:03,789 --> 00:03:05,488
that could vanish tomorrow?

70
00:03:06,492 --> 00:03:07,992
I'll buy some Bitcoin.

71
00:03:07,993 --> 00:03:09,893
I just came into
a little extra money

72
00:03:09,896 --> 00:03:11,829
when my dad raised my allowance.

73
00:03:11,831 --> 00:03:14,998
You don't have
to buy Bitcoin.

74
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,332
You can mine it.

75
00:03:16,335 --> 00:03:19,103
Mine it?
Like, mining gold?

76
00:03:19,105 --> 00:03:20,771
Sort of.
There's a limited amount,

77
00:03:20,772 --> 00:03:23,373
and we find it,
not by tunneling into the earth,

78
00:03:23,375 --> 00:03:26,777
but by using a computer to solve
complex mathematical problems.

79
00:03:26,778 --> 00:03:27,911
So let me get this straight.

80
00:03:27,914 --> 00:03:29,713
We have to write
an elaborate program

81
00:03:29,714 --> 00:03:33,484
in order to find a fake coin
that we can't spend on anything?

82
00:03:33,486 --> 00:03:36,153
Yes.
That sounds fun.

83
00:03:36,154 --> 00:03:37,220
Yeah, I'm in.

84
00:03:37,223 --> 00:03:38,289
Staying up late,

85
00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:40,857
writing code,
it sounds like a party.

86
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:42,292
Hey, Stuart.

87
00:03:42,295 --> 00:03:43,794
You want to mine
some Bitcoin with us?

88
00:03:43,795 --> 00:03:45,194
We'll write the program,
you bring the snacks?

89
00:03:45,196 --> 00:03:47,831
Too rich for my blood.

90
00:03:47,832 --> 00:03:50,634
All right, so just
the four of us.

91
00:03:50,636 --> 00:03:51,868
Before we begin,

92
00:03:51,871 --> 00:03:55,738
this may have some
unprecedented tax implications.

93
00:03:55,741 --> 00:03:57,575
In fact, we should start
early 'cause we are gonna be

94
00:03:57,576 --> 00:03:59,409
on the phone with
the IRS for hours.

95
00:03:59,411 --> 00:04:02,011
Did anybody else
just get goose bumps?

96
00:04:02,682 --> 00:04:04,949
Great, so just the three of us.

97
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:08,718
Oh, yeah.
We did it without you.

98
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:11,220
And do you remember
what happened next?

99
00:04:11,223 --> 00:04:14,457
Your mom called my mom
and said we were being mean?

100
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:17,061
And after that?

101
00:04:18,029 --> 00:04:20,864
You said that someday
we'd regret this.

102
00:04:20,865 --> 00:04:22,398
And do you know

103
00:04:22,401 --> 00:04:23,766
what today is?

104
00:04:23,768 --> 00:04:26,903
The day we found out we're rich
and none of it is yours?

105
00:04:28,975 --> 00:04:33,110
Yeah, that's right!

@elder_man

116
00:04:57,511 --> 00:04:59,824
Okay, this is the laptop

117
00:04:59,824 --> 00:05:01,458
I was using in 2010.

118
00:05:01,459 --> 00:05:03,326
The Bitcoin
must be on here.

119
00:05:03,328 --> 00:05:06,028
So what are you gonna do
with your share of the money?

120
00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:07,530
Uh, well,
as a responsible adult,

121
00:05:07,531 --> 00:05:10,165
I'll put that money into a CD,
wait for that CD to mature,

122
00:05:10,167 --> 00:05:12,569
and then buy a tiger.

123
00:05:18,643 --> 00:05:19,843
How about you?

124
00:05:19,845 --> 00:05:21,011
Oh, that depends on

125
00:05:21,012 --> 00:05:23,913
whether I tell
Bernadette or not.

126
00:05:23,915 --> 00:05:25,314
Howard, I can hear you.

127
00:05:25,317 --> 00:05:27,117
The baby monitor is on.

128
00:05:28,519 --> 00:05:30,687
I know. I was joking.

129
00:05:30,689 --> 00:05:31,788
I'm gonna put it

130
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:33,323
in a college fund.

131
00:05:38,129 --> 00:05:40,129
All right, all booted up.

132
00:05:40,131 --> 00:05:42,064
Wow, I-I knew you
were single back then,

133
00:05:42,067 --> 00:05:43,699
but that is
a lot of porn...

134
00:05:43,701 --> 00:05:46,136
Science!
A lot of science.

135
00:05:46,137 --> 00:05:50,073
Wow, you were really
into Asian science.

136
00:05:52,209 --> 00:05:53,942
I don't see the Bitcoin on here.

137
00:05:53,944 --> 00:05:55,645
Hey, maybe it's in
that folder marked

138
00:05:55,646 --> 00:05:56,980
"Private and Confidential."

139
00:05:56,982 --> 00:05:58,547
It's not!

140
00:06:00,552 --> 00:06:03,252
Okay, the program
is almost ready to run.

141
00:06:03,254 --> 00:06:06,155
Mining for coins
sounds so manly.

142
00:06:06,158 --> 00:06:09,158
Ooh, we should sing
a mining song.

143
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,826
Do you know a mining song?

144
00:06:10,829 --> 00:06:11,894
I don't know.

145
00:06:11,896 --> 00:06:13,763
Does "Tik Tok"
by Kesha count?

146
00:06:13,764 --> 00:06:16,900
Because it has tunneled
its way into my heart.

147
00:06:18,103 --> 00:06:19,903
Howard, what's going on?

148
00:06:19,905 --> 00:06:21,704
Are you boys roughhousing?

149
00:06:21,706 --> 00:06:24,006
No, we're not roughhousing!

150
00:06:24,009 --> 00:06:27,744
We're scientists!
Scientists don't roughhouse!

151
00:06:27,745 --> 00:06:31,247
Excuse me, Mr. Grown-up.

152
00:06:32,817 --> 00:06:34,150
Aw, man,
what happened?

153
00:06:34,151 --> 00:06:35,417
It crashed.

154
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:37,020
It's been doing that lately.

155
00:06:37,021 --> 00:06:39,655
I think it's got a virus
from all the...

156
00:06:39,658 --> 00:06:42,357
music I've been downloading.

157
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,860
What kind of music?

158
00:06:43,862 --> 00:06:46,562
Mostly Asian.

159
00:06:48,966 --> 00:06:50,667
Some oldies.

160
00:06:50,668 --> 00:06:54,036
Well, we can
use my laptop.

161
00:06:54,038 --> 00:06:56,206
Howard, I made cookies

162
00:06:56,208 --> 00:06:58,540
for you and your little friends!

163
00:06:58,542 --> 00:07:01,511
They're not my little friends,
and we don't want cookies!

164
00:07:01,512 --> 00:07:02,545
Actually, a cookie sounds good.

165
00:07:02,547 --> 00:07:03,812
All right, we'll have cookies!

166
00:07:03,814 --> 00:07:05,415
Thank you very much!

167
00:07:06,485 --> 00:07:08,550
That's right.
It must be on my old laptop.

168
00:07:08,552 --> 00:07:09,819
Well, let's go.

169
00:07:09,821 --> 00:07:11,720
Hey, Bernie, you mind if
I run to Leonard's and...

170
00:07:11,723 --> 00:07:13,122
Get a laptop full of money?

171
00:07:13,124 --> 00:07:16,225
Why are you still here?
Go, go, go!

172
00:07:18,562 --> 00:07:20,230
So, how's the wedding
planning going?

173
00:07:20,232 --> 00:07:21,698
Great.

174
00:07:21,699 --> 00:07:24,233
Although, we're having trouble
agreeing on a location.

175
00:07:24,235 --> 00:07:26,069
I thought you were looking
at a cliff on the beach.

176
00:07:26,071 --> 00:07:29,038
We were, but Sheldon
didn't like any of them.

177
00:07:30,641 --> 00:07:35,310
Some were too beachy,
some were too cliffy.

178
00:07:35,312 --> 00:07:38,814
And all of them
were too outsidey.

179
00:07:39,884 --> 00:07:41,451
Well, weddings aren't
about the location.

180
00:07:41,453 --> 00:07:43,685
They're about standing up in
front of your family and friends

181
00:07:43,687 --> 00:07:46,889
and promising that Sheldon
will never move back in here.

182
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:50,793
- Hi.
- Hey.

183
00:07:50,795 --> 00:07:51,895
What are you guys doing?

184
00:07:51,896 --> 00:07:54,097
Uh, we have a bunch of Bitcoin
on an old laptop,

185
00:07:54,098 --> 00:07:56,064
and it could be worth,
like, a lot of money.

186
00:07:56,067 --> 00:07:57,100
What— You're kidding.

187
00:07:57,102 --> 00:07:59,602
No. We-we could be
sitting on a fortune.

188
00:07:59,603 --> 00:08:01,805
Okay, let the record show,
I did not marry you for money,

189
00:08:01,807 --> 00:08:04,174
but you just got
way more attractive.

190
00:08:04,175 --> 00:08:07,177
Damn it,
it's not in here.

191
00:08:07,179 --> 00:08:10,579
If only you had someone around
with an eidetic memory.

192
00:08:12,249 --> 00:08:14,751
I bet they would know
what happened to it.

193
00:08:14,752 --> 00:08:16,518
If you know, just tell us.

194
00:08:16,521 --> 00:08:18,720
Excuse me, but if I recall
from seven years ago,

195
00:08:18,723 --> 00:08:21,090
you don't want me
to be a part of this.

196
00:08:22,059 --> 00:08:23,626
Sheldon,
you can't still be mad.

197
00:08:23,627 --> 00:08:24,727
Oh, please.

198
00:08:24,728 --> 00:08:26,762
I have grudges that
go back to preschool.

199
00:08:28,165 --> 00:08:30,667
Someday, I'm gonna find
a grown-up Elaine Dwyer

200
00:08:30,668 --> 00:08:34,304
and eat her favorite crayon
while she watches.

201
00:08:34,305 --> 00:08:37,841
Is that why there's an
Elaine Dwyer on our guest list?

202
00:08:37,843 --> 00:08:39,275
Yes.

203
00:08:39,276 --> 00:08:41,410
That night, I'm going to have
the first dance

204
00:08:41,412 --> 00:08:44,380
and the last laugh.

205
00:08:44,381 --> 00:08:46,449
Sheldon, please.

206
00:08:46,450 --> 00:08:48,684
Should I be the bigger man?

207
00:08:48,686 --> 00:08:50,053
I think you should.

208
00:08:50,055 --> 00:08:52,021
Oh, why'd I ask you?

209
00:08:54,825 --> 00:08:57,492
Hey there, pretty lady.

210
00:08:57,495 --> 00:08:59,996
I'm not waiting
on your table for you.

211
00:08:59,997 --> 00:09:03,366
Come on,
this one is so annoying.

212
00:09:03,367 --> 00:09:05,234
Excuse me, waitress.

213
00:09:05,237 --> 00:09:07,770
You guys ready
to order?

214
00:09:07,771 --> 00:09:09,705
Can you take
our picture, please?

215
00:09:09,708 --> 00:09:11,107
Oh, sure.

216
00:09:11,108 --> 00:09:12,308
Smile!

217
00:09:16,448 --> 00:09:18,146
Perfect.

218
00:09:18,149 --> 00:09:20,149
Thank you.
You may go now.

219
00:09:20,151 --> 00:09:21,316
It was nice to meet you,

220
00:09:21,319 --> 00:09:24,887
and I mean that politely,
not sincerely.

221
00:09:25,924 --> 00:09:27,223
What was that?

222
00:09:27,224 --> 00:09:29,626
I need to prove to my mother
that I'm on a date.

223
00:09:29,627 --> 00:09:30,993
If she thinks
I faked the picture,

224
00:09:30,996 --> 00:09:32,829
I might need you as a witness.
What's your name?

225
00:09:32,830 --> 00:09:35,497
Bernadette.

226
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:37,500
Hey, sweetie.

227
00:09:37,502 --> 00:09:38,434
Hey.
Everybody good?

228
00:09:38,435 --> 00:09:40,169
- Yeah. - Fine.
- Sure.

229
00:09:42,207 --> 00:09:45,341
You don't have to whisper,
you can just nod your head.

230
00:09:47,311 --> 00:09:49,679
Or you could just speak.

231
00:09:51,516 --> 00:09:52,949
You having a good day?

232
00:09:52,950 --> 00:09:54,383
No, I missed an audition

233
00:09:54,386 --> 00:09:56,252
because my computer broke,
and I didn't get the e-mail.

234
00:09:56,253 --> 00:09:58,253
Would've been
a perfect part for me.

235
00:09:58,256 --> 00:10:00,055
Was it waitress
who ignores her customers?

236
00:10:00,058 --> 00:10:02,391
Because that's the role
you were born to play.

237
00:10:02,393 --> 00:10:05,060
Shut up and eat your burger.

238
00:10:05,063 --> 00:10:07,296
Actually, it's a turkey club.

239
00:10:07,299 --> 00:10:08,298
Didn't you order a burger?

240
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:10,565
I did, and yet here we are.

241
00:10:10,568 --> 00:10:13,402
You know what,
if you need a computer,

242
00:10:13,405 --> 00:10:15,070
you can use my laptop.

243
00:10:15,073 --> 00:10:17,272
Oh, that's sweet, but I'm not
gonna take your computer.

244
00:10:17,275 --> 00:10:18,907
Oh, it's fine.
I-I'm getting a new one anyway.

245
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:20,543
- Are you sure?
- Don't be silly.

246
00:10:20,545 --> 00:10:22,377
He's desperate
to hold on to you.

247
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:24,213
You can get anything out of him.

248
00:10:24,214 --> 00:10:25,681
His car, his watch...

249
00:10:25,684 --> 00:10:27,816
Maybe a kidney.
You already have his testicles.

250
00:10:27,819 --> 00:10:29,886
You can start a collection.

251
00:10:31,455 --> 00:10:33,989
Oh, my God, that's right.
You gave me your laptop.

252
00:10:33,992 --> 00:10:35,223
That was so sweet.

253
00:10:35,226 --> 00:10:36,758
So you know where it is?
Of course.

254
00:10:36,761 --> 00:10:38,093
- All right! - Yes!
- Great!

255
00:10:38,095 --> 00:10:39,362
I gave it to
my ex-boyfriend Zack.

256
00:10:39,363 --> 00:10:41,597
- Come on! - Why?
- No!

257
00:10:44,699 --> 00:10:46,265
Okay, Zack,
thank you so much.

258
00:10:46,266 --> 00:10:47,299
We'll be right over.

259
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:48,934
He still has it.

260
00:10:48,935 --> 00:10:51,804
I can't believe you took
a gift from me

261
00:10:51,805 --> 00:10:53,338
and gave it to another man.

262
00:10:53,341 --> 00:10:54,873
Really?

263
00:10:54,876 --> 00:10:56,941
Of all the things she's given
to other men,

264
00:10:56,944 --> 00:10:58,444
that's what you're
concerned about?

265
00:11:00,415 --> 00:11:02,848
Please don't make
a big deal about this.

266
00:11:02,849 --> 00:11:05,418
It was a long time ago,
we were broken up.

267
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:06,584
Which breakup was that?

268
00:11:06,587 --> 00:11:08,954
Was that the Saint
Valentine's Day Massacre?

269
00:11:09,656 --> 00:11:11,022
No, no.

270
00:11:11,025 --> 00:11:13,492
This might've been during
the Comic-Con Dump-A-Thon.

271
00:11:14,395 --> 00:11:15,828
You have names for our breakups?

272
00:11:15,829 --> 00:11:18,597
Well, they would really
blur together if we didn't.

273
00:11:19,733 --> 00:11:21,467
The Comic-Con breakup's
easy to remember

274
00:11:21,468 --> 00:11:25,136
because Leonard
was the saddest Pikachu.

275
00:11:25,138 --> 00:11:27,540
Right, and he wiped his nose
on your cape,

276
00:11:27,541 --> 00:11:29,941
and then you were
the saddest Darth Vader.

277
00:11:31,846 --> 00:11:35,079
You know, Penny and I aren't
the only ones who've broken up.

278
00:11:35,082 --> 00:11:36,614
So did Howard and Bernadette.

279
00:11:36,617 --> 00:11:41,053
Uh, not to brag, but all
my breakups have lasted.

280
00:11:42,589 --> 00:11:44,924
I'm so sorry to hear
about you and Howard.

281
00:11:44,925 --> 00:11:47,159
Thanks. I just
didn't think he was

282
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:49,829
the kind of guy who would be
doing weird stuff online.

283
00:11:49,830 --> 00:11:53,232
Really? Wow, I thought
it was so obvious, but okay.

284
00:11:54,468 --> 00:11:56,669
Look, I know it's hard,
but I think the best thing

285
00:11:56,670 --> 00:11:58,804
to do after a breakup
is to take some time

286
00:11:58,805 --> 00:11:59,838
and be by yourself.

287
00:11:59,841 --> 00:12:02,241
Yeah, that's healthy.

288
00:12:02,242 --> 00:12:03,409
Hey, babe,
ready to go?

289
00:12:03,410 --> 00:12:05,478
Do as I say, not as I do.

290
00:12:09,183 --> 00:12:11,851
I cannot believe you're mad.

291
00:12:11,853 --> 00:12:12,952
I'm not mad.

292
00:12:12,954 --> 00:12:15,253
Oh, really?
Tell that to your eyebrows.

293
00:12:15,256 --> 00:12:19,090
Bet I could place a
quarter between them,

294
00:12:19,093 --> 00:12:21,893
and it would
just stay there.

295
00:12:21,896 --> 00:12:24,063
Fine, I'm mad.

296
00:12:24,064 --> 00:12:26,665
I guess I was more upset
by our breakup than you.

297
00:12:26,666 --> 00:12:28,766
That is not true.
Of course I was upset.

298
00:12:28,768 --> 00:12:29,934
Didn't seem like it.

299
00:12:29,936 --> 00:12:31,337
You started dating the first

300
00:12:31,338 --> 00:12:33,539
tall, handsome hunk
you could find.

301
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:34,839
I'm sorry,

302
00:12:34,842 --> 00:12:39,844
are you mad that I dated Zack
or that you didn't?

303
00:12:44,651 --> 00:12:46,551
- Hi. - Hi.
- Hey, Zack.

304
00:12:46,554 --> 00:12:48,920
So good to see you guys.

305
00:12:48,923 --> 00:12:51,824
Man, we should
do this more often.

306
00:12:51,825 --> 00:12:54,226
Come over to get laptops
back from you?

307
00:12:54,228 --> 00:12:55,593
Totally.

308
00:12:55,595 --> 00:12:58,264
So do you have it?

309
00:12:58,266 --> 00:13:00,366
Of course I do.
Penny gave it to me as a gift.

310
00:13:00,367 --> 00:13:02,200
You don't get rid
of something like that.

311
00:13:05,473 --> 00:13:07,805
Huh.

312
00:13:07,808 --> 00:13:10,041
All right, I'm sorry
I gave away your stupid laptop.

313
00:13:10,044 --> 00:13:12,911
You should be. We were broken
up for, like, five minutes.

314
00:13:12,914 --> 00:13:13,878
Are you guys fighting?

315
00:13:13,881 --> 00:13:15,046
Yeah.
No.

316
00:13:15,049 --> 00:13:16,214
Are you fighting about

317
00:13:16,217 --> 00:13:17,482
whether or not you're fighting?

318
00:13:17,484 --> 00:13:18,784
'Cause I've had
that fight before.

319
00:13:18,785 --> 00:13:21,420
Turns out we were,
and I lost.

320
00:13:21,421 --> 00:13:23,555
Leonard thinks when we broke up,
it didn't bother me.

321
00:13:23,558 --> 00:13:24,924
That's crazy.

322
00:13:24,925 --> 00:13:27,559
When we were going out, she used
to talk about you all the time.

323
00:13:27,561 --> 00:13:29,395
In fact, I think
she only dated me

324
00:13:29,396 --> 00:13:32,665
because I reminded her of you.

325
00:13:35,435 --> 00:13:38,237
Sure.

326
00:13:38,238 --> 00:13:40,271
Because we're both...

327
00:13:40,274 --> 00:13:42,308
people?

328
00:13:42,309 --> 00:13:44,276
Damn right we are.

329
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:48,613
Oh, also, there was that video
about how much she missed you.

330
00:13:48,616 --> 00:13:51,282
What video?
The one on the laptop.

331
00:13:51,285 --> 00:13:55,353
I didn't mean to invade your
privacy, but I am a huge snoop.

332
00:13:55,356 --> 00:13:57,289
Ask my neighbor.
She'll tell you.

333
00:13:57,290 --> 00:13:59,525
But not right now;
she's in the shower.

334
00:14:08,035 --> 00:14:10,169
Hello, Leonard.

335
00:14:10,170 --> 00:14:13,671
I was gonna write you an e-mail,
but I'm a little drunk,

336
00:14:13,674 --> 00:14:17,943
and spelling is
a sober person's game, so...

337
00:14:20,146 --> 00:14:23,281
I feel I owe you a 'splanation.

338
00:14:23,284 --> 00:14:25,950
I— I'm sorry.

339
00:14:25,953 --> 00:14:28,053
A 'splanation.

340
00:14:29,357 --> 00:14:31,390
Penny. Penny.

341
00:14:31,391 --> 00:14:32,524
Penny.

342
00:14:32,526 --> 00:14:34,593
Sheldon, go away.
I'm making a video.

343
00:14:34,594 --> 00:14:35,761
Oh, I'm sorry.

344
00:14:35,762 --> 00:14:37,762
I'll come back
when you're alone.

345
00:14:37,765 --> 00:14:40,466
No, no, no.
I am alone.

346
00:14:40,468 --> 00:14:42,968
I'm just telling Leonard
why I broke up with him.

347
00:14:42,969 --> 00:14:44,535
Oh, he knows.

348
00:14:44,537 --> 00:14:45,970
The video I want to see

349
00:14:45,973 --> 00:14:48,439
is why you went out with him
in the first place.

350
00:14:48,441 --> 00:14:51,510
I went out with him
because he's great.

351
00:14:51,511 --> 00:14:53,579
And if I kept
going out with him,

352
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:55,046
I probably would've married him,

353
00:14:55,049 --> 00:14:56,748
and that's
a little scary

354
00:14:56,751 --> 00:14:58,784
because I just don't think
I'm ready for that.

355
00:14:58,785 --> 00:15:03,789
You know, plus I have got to
learn how to spell Hofstadter.

356
00:15:03,790 --> 00:15:05,256
I-I know there's
a "D" in there,

357
00:15:05,258 --> 00:15:09,694
but it keeps moving
every time I try and write it.

358
00:15:09,697 --> 00:15:12,064
Sheldon, what do I do?

359
00:15:12,065 --> 00:15:15,833
Try to pass out facedown, so you
don't choke on your vomit.

360
00:15:16,737 --> 00:15:20,104
I am not
gonna pass out.

361
00:15:20,107 --> 00:15:23,242
But thank you anyway.

362
00:15:27,848 --> 00:15:30,082
Wow.
I know.

363
00:15:30,083 --> 00:15:33,084
There's, like, two more hours
of her just lying there.

364
00:15:35,655 --> 00:15:38,957
Aw, you love me
so much.

365
00:15:38,958 --> 00:15:41,226
I married you,
jackass.

366
00:15:41,228 --> 00:15:43,495
I... I know, and not
just out of pity

367
00:15:43,497 --> 00:15:46,699
like everyone said
in their wedding toast.

368
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:48,633
You want to see the part
where she falls off the chair?

369
00:15:48,636 --> 00:15:50,334
No.
Totally.

370
00:16:01,915 --> 00:16:04,982
That's my wife.

371
00:16:04,984 --> 00:16:07,585
I got to see that again.

372
00:16:08,723 --> 00:16:12,223
Got the laptop.
Hand it here.

373
00:16:12,226 --> 00:16:14,126
Oh, this is
so exciting!

374
00:16:14,127 --> 00:16:16,661
Hey, when we sell the Bitcoin,
are you gonna pay your dad back

375
00:16:16,664 --> 00:16:18,463
all the money you took from him
over the years?

376
00:16:18,465 --> 00:16:21,800
Never even
crossed my mind.

377
00:16:21,801 --> 00:16:24,203
Okay, here's
the Bitcoin folder.

378
00:16:24,204 --> 00:16:25,904
Yeah, how much
is in there?

379
00:16:27,208 --> 00:16:29,174
It's empty.

380
00:16:29,175 --> 00:16:30,675
What?
Th-That's impossible.

381
00:16:30,678 --> 00:16:33,545
Do you think Zack stole it?

382
00:16:33,546 --> 00:16:35,814
No, he doesn't know
how to steal Bitcoin.

383
00:16:35,815 --> 00:16:38,016
I mean, he waves at trucks.

384
00:16:40,654 --> 00:16:43,789
Hmm...
who could it have been?

385
00:16:45,358 --> 00:16:47,859
Sheldon,
what did you do?

386
00:16:47,862 --> 00:16:49,428
I plotted my revenge.

387
00:16:49,430 --> 00:16:53,397
If you get a dish,
I'll serve you some cold.

388
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:56,200
What, y-you stole
our Bitcoin?

389
00:16:56,203 --> 00:16:57,236
Oh, calm down.

390
00:16:57,237 --> 00:16:59,204
All I did was sneak
onto your computer

391
00:16:59,205 --> 00:17:01,973
and download your Bitcoin
onto a flash drive.

392
00:17:01,976 --> 00:17:03,407
What?

393
00:17:03,410 --> 00:17:04,376
I'm not keeping it.

394
00:17:04,377 --> 00:17:06,444
I just wanted
to watch you sweat.

395
00:17:06,447 --> 00:17:07,979
If you want to watch
him sweat,

396
00:17:07,981 --> 00:17:10,516
walk up a flight
of stairs with him.

397
00:17:12,318 --> 00:17:16,522
I've waited seven long years,
but it finally happened.

398
00:17:16,524 --> 00:17:17,890
Where's our money?

399
00:17:17,891 --> 00:17:19,324
That's the best part.

400
00:17:19,325 --> 00:17:23,094
It's on the Batman flash drive
on your key chain.

401
00:17:23,096 --> 00:17:25,296
You've had it
in your pocket all along.

402
00:17:28,435 --> 00:17:30,936
Sheldon...

403
00:17:30,938 --> 00:17:33,839
I lost that key chain years ago.

404
00:17:37,410 --> 00:17:40,278
Really?

405
00:17:40,281 --> 00:17:43,849
D-D-Did you look under things?

406
00:17:46,152 --> 00:17:49,353
Well, that is unfortunate.

407
00:17:49,355 --> 00:17:51,989
I guess we've all learned
a lesson today.

408
00:17:53,893 --> 00:17:55,360
What was the lesson?

409
00:17:55,362 --> 00:17:56,695
I don't know.

410
00:18:04,697 --> 00:18:08,031
Huh. What's that?

411
00:18:08,422 --> 00:18:13,093
Ooh, Batman flash drive.

412
00:18:13,094 --> 00:18:15,894
Pretty cool.

413
00:18:15,897 --> 00:18:17,796
Huh, if I erase this,

414
00:18:17,798 --> 00:18:21,868
I could probably resell it
for, like, ten bucks.

415
00:18:21,870 --> 00:18:23,902
Things are finally
going my way.

416
