1
00:00:09,772 --> 00:00:11,690
Hello. I'm Dr. Sheldon Cooper.

2
00:00:11,732 --> 00:00:14,110
And I'm Dr. Amy Farrah Fowler.

3
00:00:14,151 --> 00:00:15,778
And this is:

4
00:00:14,151 --> 00:00:15,778
Dr. Sheldon Cooper

5
00:00:15,819 --> 00:00:17,613
and Dr. Amy Farrah

6
00:00:15,819 --> 00:00:17,613
Fowler present...

7
00:00:17,654 --> 00:00:22,034
BOTH: Dr. Sheldon Cooper's

8
00:00:17,654 --> 00:00:22,034
Fun with Flags.

9
00:00:22,076 --> 00:00:25,079
I'd like to start this episode

10
00:00:22,076 --> 00:00:25,079
by apologizing on behalf

11
00:00:25,121 --> 00:00:27,539
of Dr. Fowler, who made

12
00:00:25,121 --> 00:00:27,539
the wild claim last week

13
00:00:27,581 --> 00:00:29,416
that there was no national

14
00:00:27,581 --> 00:00:29,416
tricolored flag

15
00:00:29,458 --> 00:00:31,501
with a purple stripe,

16
00:00:29,458 --> 00:00:31,501
when, in fact,

17
00:00:31,543 --> 00:00:33,462
the Estonian governorate

18
00:00:31,543 --> 00:00:33,462
inside the Russian Empire

19
00:00:33,503 --> 00:00:38,467
had a purple stripe on their

20
00:00:33,503 --> 00:00:38,467
flag from 1721 to 1917.

21
00:00:40,343 --> 00:00:44,640
See? Right there

22
00:00:40,343 --> 00:00:44,640
in the middle.

23
00:00:44,681 --> 00:00:47,643
And I'd like to apologize

24
00:00:44,681 --> 00:00:47,643
on behalf of Dr. Cooper

25
00:00:47,684 --> 00:00:50,062
for having his zipper down

26
00:00:47,684 --> 00:00:50,062
for the entire segment

27
00:00:50,104 --> 00:00:53,565
on the flags of East Africa.

28
00:00:53,607 --> 00:00:57,444
Sorry, Tanzania,

29
00:00:53,607 --> 00:00:57,444
you deserve better.

30
00:00:57,486 --> 00:00:59,488
All right, on today's episode,

31
00:00:59,529 --> 00:01:01,282
we're gonna start

32
00:00:59,529 --> 00:01:01,282
with some viewer e-mails.

33
00:01:01,322 --> 00:01:03,159
Oh, take off your glasses

34
00:01:01,322 --> 00:01:03,159
so people can't see

35
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,660
your password in

36
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,660
the reflection.

37
00:01:04,701 --> 00:01:07,913
Oh, s-sure.

38
00:01:07,955 --> 00:01:11,708
Okay, our first e-mail

39
00:01:07,955 --> 00:01:11,708
is— mm— from...

40
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:14,170
uh, Brad or Brian?

41
00:01:14,211 --> 00:01:17,965
I don't know, maybe it's Seth.

42
00:01:14,211 --> 00:01:17,965
All right, put them back on.

43
00:01:18,007 --> 00:01:22,928
Oh. Uh... oh, my gosh,

44
00:01:18,007 --> 00:01:22,928
it's from Fermilab in Chicago.

45
00:01:22,970 --> 00:01:25,764
Ah. Not surprising,

46
00:01:22,970 --> 00:01:25,764
the Windy City.

47
00:01:25,806 --> 00:01:28,309
Great flag town.

48
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:30,269
No, no, it's about our paper.

49
00:01:30,311 --> 00:01:34,106
A team of physicists confirmed

50
00:01:30,311 --> 00:01:34,106
super-asymmetry.

51
00:01:34,148 --> 00:01:36,483
Our paper was right.

52
00:01:36,525 --> 00:01:38,110
We did it.

53
00:01:38,152 --> 00:01:39,862
We did it?

54
00:01:39,903 --> 00:01:42,114
We did it.

55
00:01:42,156 --> 00:01:43,907
We did it.

56
00:01:43,949 --> 00:01:46,743
BOTH:

57
00:01:43,949 --> 00:01:46,743
We did it!

58
00:01:46,785 --> 00:01:51,040
We did it!

59
00:01:46,785 --> 00:01:51,040
We did it!

60
00:01:51,081 --> 00:01:55,127
Aw, remember when they only

61
00:01:51,081 --> 00:01:55,127
did it on her birthday?

has some exciting news.

78
00:02:24,907 --> 00:02:26,909
Howie, stop.

79
00:02:24,907 --> 00:02:26,909
I don't want to brag.

80
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:29,286
Oh, okay, sorry.

81
00:02:30,204 --> 00:02:32,081
(clears throat)

82
00:02:36,377 --> 00:02:38,837
Really? No one's gonna ask?

83
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:41,548
Sorry. What's your news?

84
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:43,717
The drug I've been working on

85
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:43,717
for the past five years

86
00:02:43,759 --> 00:02:45,302
just got approved by the FDA.

87
00:02:45,344 --> 00:02:47,304
Wow.

88
00:02:45,344 --> 00:02:47,304
Oh, congratulations.

89
00:02:47,346 --> 00:02:49,139
Was that the decongestant

90
00:02:47,346 --> 00:02:49,139
you developed?

91
00:02:49,181 --> 00:02:52,642
No, we had to rebrand that as

92
00:02:49,181 --> 00:02:52,642
a solvent for mining equipment.

93
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:57,022
Is it that anti-itch cream you

94
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:57,022
were testing on grad students?

95
00:02:57,064 --> 00:02:58,857
It's not, but that's

96
00:02:57,064 --> 00:02:58,857
a really funny story

97
00:02:58,899 --> 00:03:01,526
which I'm legally prevented

98
00:02:58,899 --> 00:03:01,526
from telling you.

99
00:03:02,652 --> 00:03:03,653
It's her

100
00:03:02,652 --> 00:03:03,653
anti-inflammatory drug.

101
00:03:03,695 --> 00:03:05,281
Oh.

102
00:03:03,695 --> 00:03:05,281
Yep.

103
00:03:05,322 --> 00:03:07,283
Three years of testing

104
00:03:05,322 --> 00:03:07,283
and no reported side effects.

105
00:03:07,324 --> 00:03:08,575
Ah, so it works.

106
00:03:08,617 --> 00:03:09,826
Eh.

107
00:03:11,745 --> 00:03:14,373
Well, congratulations.

108
00:03:11,745 --> 00:03:14,373
I'm so happy for you.

109
00:03:14,415 --> 00:03:15,874
Yeah, well, I'm happy for you,

110
00:03:15,916 --> 00:03:17,626
because I want you

111
00:03:15,916 --> 00:03:17,626
to head up my sales team.

112
00:03:17,667 --> 00:03:20,963
Really? Me? Don't you want

113
00:03:17,667 --> 00:03:20,963
someone with more experience?

114
00:03:21,004 --> 00:03:22,131
Nope. The job's all yours.

115
00:03:22,172 --> 00:03:23,673
(laughs)

116
00:03:22,172 --> 00:03:23,673
Okay, well, thank you.

117
00:03:23,715 --> 00:03:25,550
Why don't we just chat

118
00:03:23,715 --> 00:03:25,550
about this at work?

119
00:03:25,592 --> 00:03:28,304
We can chat about it all you

120
00:03:25,592 --> 00:03:28,304
want, but you're doing it.

121
00:03:28,345 --> 00:03:31,014
(chuckles)

122
00:03:28,345 --> 00:03:31,014
We'll see.

123
00:03:31,056 --> 00:03:33,474
That's a yes.

124
00:03:33,516 --> 00:03:35,685
You guys will never believe

125
00:03:33,516 --> 00:03:35,685
what just happened.

126
00:03:35,727 --> 00:03:37,020
Yeah, we heard.

127
00:03:37,062 --> 00:03:38,981
You did it.

128
00:03:39,022 --> 00:03:42,192
We did do it.

129
00:03:42,234 --> 00:03:45,404
And we didn't even

130
00:03:42,234 --> 00:03:45,404
know we did it!

131
00:03:46,488 --> 00:03:48,407
Wait, what?

132
00:03:48,449 --> 00:03:52,411
Two physicists in Chicago

133
00:03:48,449 --> 00:03:52,411
had to tell us.

134
00:03:53,662 --> 00:03:56,498
Wait, what?

135
00:03:56,539 --> 00:03:59,293
Their experiment on kaon decay

136
00:03:56,539 --> 00:03:59,293
supported our predictions

137
00:03:59,335 --> 00:04:02,338
on the higher order corrections

138
00:03:59,335 --> 00:04:02,338
pertaining to super-asymmetry.

139
00:04:02,379 --> 00:04:04,965
Wait, what?

140
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:08,635
I am so proud of you.

141
00:04:08,677 --> 00:04:10,262
Well, I know how

142
00:04:08,677 --> 00:04:10,262
to do the dishes.

143
00:04:10,304 --> 00:04:12,555
Just, sometimes

144
00:04:10,304 --> 00:04:12,555
I'm tired.

145
00:04:15,184 --> 00:04:18,770
No, I-I mean, I'm proud of

146
00:04:15,184 --> 00:04:18,770
how well you're doing at work.

147
00:04:18,812 --> 00:04:20,856
Are you even using soap?

148
00:04:20,897 --> 00:04:23,525
Do you want to do this?

149
00:04:20,897 --> 00:04:23,525
Yeah, I really do.

150
00:04:23,566 --> 00:04:25,361
You know, it was nice

151
00:04:23,566 --> 00:04:25,361
of Bernadette to offer,

152
00:04:25,402 --> 00:04:27,321
but I'm not sure it's

153
00:04:25,402 --> 00:04:27,321
the right move for me.

154
00:04:27,363 --> 00:04:28,905
Well, what are you

155
00:04:27,363 --> 00:04:28,905
talking about?

156
00:04:28,947 --> 00:04:30,407
If you were in charge

157
00:04:28,947 --> 00:04:30,407
of her project,

158
00:04:30,449 --> 00:04:32,159
wouldn't that

159
00:04:30,449 --> 00:04:32,159
be a promotion?

160
00:04:32,201 --> 00:04:34,036
Well, yeah, but it's not

161
00:04:32,201 --> 00:04:34,036
the most important thing.

162
00:04:34,077 --> 00:04:35,704
Aren't you always saying

163
00:04:34,077 --> 00:04:35,704
it's about the work,

164
00:04:35,745 --> 00:04:37,831
not more money

165
00:04:35,745 --> 00:04:37,831
or a better title?

166
00:04:37,873 --> 00:04:41,377
All the smart things I say,

167
00:04:37,873 --> 00:04:41,377
and you remember the dumb one.

168
00:04:41,418 --> 00:04:43,628
Plus, I'd be working

169
00:04:41,418 --> 00:04:43,628
for Bernadette.

170
00:04:43,670 --> 00:04:45,297
I don't know

171
00:04:43,670 --> 00:04:45,297
if that's a good idea.

172
00:04:45,339 --> 00:04:47,757
Look, I-I know she

173
00:04:45,339 --> 00:04:47,757
can be difficult,

174
00:04:47,799 --> 00:04:49,426
but she's no match for you.

175
00:04:49,468 --> 00:04:52,304
Whatever she dishes out, you

176
00:04:49,468 --> 00:04:52,304
can give it right back double.

177
00:04:52,346 --> 00:04:53,763
What the hell

178
00:04:52,346 --> 00:04:53,763
is that supposed to mean?

179
00:04:53,805 --> 00:04:56,266
There you go.

180
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,810
(intercom beeps)

181
00:04:58,852 --> 00:05:00,437
RECEPTIONIST:

182
00:04:58,852 --> 00:05:00,437
President Siebert,

183
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:02,605
I have Dr. Cooper

184
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:02,605
and Dr. Fowler for you.

185
00:05:02,647 --> 00:05:04,107
Great.

186
00:05:04,149 --> 00:05:06,776
You two.

187
00:05:06,818 --> 00:05:09,321
Bring it in.

188
00:05:09,363 --> 00:05:11,240
(stammers) What are

189
00:05:09,363 --> 00:05:11,240
we bringing in?

190
00:05:11,281 --> 00:05:12,741
A hug.

191
00:05:12,782 --> 00:05:15,536
Oh. No, I don't want to.

192
00:05:15,577 --> 00:05:18,372
Well, what you don't want,

193
00:05:15,577 --> 00:05:18,372
you don't get.

194
00:05:18,414 --> 00:05:20,832
Come on. Sit.

195
00:05:20,874 --> 00:05:23,377
I hope you know, with these

196
00:05:20,874 --> 00:05:23,377
new data supporting your theory,

197
00:05:23,419 --> 00:05:26,129
we could be looking

198
00:05:23,419 --> 00:05:26,129
at a Nobel-winning achievement.

199
00:05:26,171 --> 00:05:28,173
And by "we,"

200
00:05:28,215 --> 00:05:29,591
you mean "we,"

201
00:05:29,632 --> 00:05:31,760
not "we."

202
00:05:31,801 --> 00:05:34,263
"We,"we," whatever.

203
00:05:34,304 --> 00:05:35,638
Whee!

204
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,891
Just a heads-up.

205
00:05:37,933 --> 00:05:39,893
Doctors Pemberton and Campbell

206
00:05:37,933 --> 00:05:39,893
from Fermilab

207
00:05:39,935 --> 00:05:42,812
are flying to Los Angeles,

208
00:05:39,935 --> 00:05:42,812
and they are eager to meet you.

209
00:05:42,854 --> 00:05:45,315
Confirming my theory,

210
00:05:42,854 --> 00:05:45,315
eager to meet me.

211
00:05:45,357 --> 00:05:47,776
They are checking

212
00:05:45,357 --> 00:05:47,776
all my boxes.

213
00:05:47,817 --> 00:05:49,986
You know,

214
00:05:47,817 --> 00:05:49,986
Caltech has 38 Nobel laureates.

215
00:05:50,028 --> 00:05:53,782
If you win, you and Amy

216
00:05:50,028 --> 00:05:53,782
will be 39 and 40.

217
00:05:53,823 --> 00:05:56,493
Ooh! Dibs on 39.

218
00:05:56,535 --> 00:05:58,120
What's the difference?

219
00:05:58,161 --> 00:06:00,539
Wha... You are right,

220
00:05:58,161 --> 00:06:00,539
there is no difference at all.

221
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:07,129
Thank you. It is exciting.

222
00:06:07,170 --> 00:06:08,629
Oh, that's very sweet.

223
00:06:08,671 --> 00:06:10,424
I'm gonna remember

224
00:06:08,671 --> 00:06:10,424
you said that.

225
00:06:10,466 --> 00:06:12,842
Just like I remember how

226
00:06:10,466 --> 00:06:12,842
you tried to take my office

227
00:06:12,884 --> 00:06:14,511
when I was on maternity leave.

228
00:06:14,553 --> 00:06:16,346
(laughs)

229
00:06:16,388 --> 00:06:18,432
Of course I'm not angry.

230
00:06:18,474 --> 00:06:20,309
Bye-bye.

231
00:06:20,350 --> 00:06:22,727
How can I be angry

232
00:06:20,350 --> 00:06:22,727
at a dead man?

233
00:06:24,354 --> 00:06:25,981
Hey, you got a sec?

234
00:06:26,022 --> 00:06:26,940
Sure. What's up?

235
00:06:26,982 --> 00:06:28,775
Uh, bad news.

236
00:06:28,817 --> 00:06:30,319
I spoke to my supervisor

237
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:32,028
about heading up

238
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:32,028
your sales team, and she said

239
00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:33,572
she just can't

240
00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:33,572
lose me right now.

241
00:06:33,614 --> 00:06:35,073
Do you want me to call her?

242
00:06:35,115 --> 00:06:36,575
I could rip her a new one.

243
00:06:36,617 --> 00:06:38,368
No, no. No ripping.

244
00:06:38,410 --> 00:06:40,703
Um, anyway, I-I don't want

245
00:06:38,410 --> 00:06:40,703
to leave her shorthanded,

246
00:06:40,745 --> 00:06:41,913
so I'm sorry.

247
00:06:41,955 --> 00:06:43,748
I respect that.

248
00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:45,501
That's what makes you

249
00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:45,501
a good employee.

250
00:06:45,542 --> 00:06:46,627
Oh, thank you.

251
00:06:46,667 --> 00:06:48,044
It's just such a bummer.

252
00:06:48,086 --> 00:06:51,131
I know. Just, ugh!

253
00:06:51,173 --> 00:06:53,425
You sure you don't want me

254
00:06:51,173 --> 00:06:53,425
to call her?

255
00:06:53,467 --> 00:06:55,511
Oh, no, I'm sure, definitely

256
00:06:53,467 --> 00:06:55,511
sure. Don't call her.

257
00:06:55,552 --> 00:06:58,388
But, you know, just, ugh, why?

258
00:07:01,141 --> 00:07:04,227
The last time we were in this

259
00:07:01,141 --> 00:07:04,227
room, we were getting married.

260
00:07:04,269 --> 00:07:05,521
I remember.

261
00:07:05,562 --> 00:07:07,397
It's a lot less

262
00:07:05,562 --> 00:07:07,397
impressive

263
00:07:07,439 --> 00:07:09,941
without

264
00:07:07,439 --> 00:07:09,941
Mark Hamill in it.

265
00:07:09,983 --> 00:07:11,776
That's what you said

266
00:07:09,983 --> 00:07:11,776
about our honeymoon.

267
00:07:11,818 --> 00:07:14,029
And I stand by it.

268
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:15,696
Doctors Cooper and Fowler,

269
00:07:15,738 --> 00:07:17,324
these are Doctors Pemberton

270
00:07:15,738 --> 00:07:17,324
and Campbell,

271
00:07:17,366 --> 00:07:18,950
whose experiment

272
00:07:17,366 --> 00:07:18,950
confirmed your work.

273
00:07:18,992 --> 00:07:21,537
Hello. Nice to meet you.

274
00:07:18,992 --> 00:07:21,537
Nice to meet you. Hi.

275
00:07:24,956 --> 00:07:27,209
Okay, I'll leave you all to it.

276
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:29,586
Remember about

277
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:29,586
the hugging.

278
00:07:31,463 --> 00:07:34,216
It is such a pleasure

279
00:07:31,463 --> 00:07:34,216
to meet you.

280
00:07:34,257 --> 00:07:36,092
Oh, it's really nice

281
00:07:34,257 --> 00:07:36,092
to meet you, too.

282
00:07:36,134 --> 00:07:38,011
I mean, we thought we'd

283
00:07:36,134 --> 00:07:38,011
have to wait decades

284
00:07:38,053 --> 00:07:39,596
to get confirmation

285
00:07:38,053 --> 00:07:39,596
for our theory.

286
00:07:39,638 --> 00:07:41,931
Yes, thanks to you,

287
00:07:39,638 --> 00:07:41,931
I'll get to eat my Nobel dinner

288
00:07:41,973 --> 00:07:43,808
with my original teeth.

289
00:07:43,850 --> 00:07:46,520
Well, this certainly is a thrill

290
00:07:43,850 --> 00:07:46,520
for us. Lunch with you two,

291
00:07:46,562 --> 00:07:49,356
and, uh, tomorrow, we're gonna

292
00:07:46,562 --> 00:07:49,356
see a taping of Ellen.

293
00:07:50,315 --> 00:07:51,941
She's having John Stamos on.

294
00:07:51,983 --> 00:07:53,402
Uncle Jesse!

295
00:07:53,443 --> 00:07:55,945
Sounds fun.

296
00:07:55,987 --> 00:07:59,658
So, um, listen, we just

297
00:07:55,987 --> 00:07:59,658
published a few months ago.

298
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:02,202
How did you have time to

299
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:02,202
design an experiment?

300
00:08:02,244 --> 00:08:06,582
We didn't. This whole thing

301
00:08:02,244 --> 00:08:06,582
is actually a gigantic accident.

302
00:08:06,623 --> 00:08:08,208
CAMPBELL: Yeah, we've been

303
00:08:06,623 --> 00:08:08,208
working with kaons,

304
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:10,460
and our data made

305
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:10,460
absolutely no sense.

306
00:08:10,502 --> 00:08:12,588
A few weeks ago, someone

307
00:08:10,502 --> 00:08:12,588
told us about your paper,

308
00:08:12,629 --> 00:08:14,715
and we realized

309
00:08:12,629 --> 00:08:14,715
that our failed experiment

310
00:08:14,756 --> 00:08:16,425
confirmed your theory.

311
00:08:16,466 --> 00:08:17,926
And now,

312
00:08:16,466 --> 00:08:17,926
instead of losing our jobs,

313
00:08:17,967 --> 00:08:20,470
Fermilab flew us to L.A.

314
00:08:17,967 --> 00:08:20,470
Economy Plus.

315
00:08:22,431 --> 00:08:24,474
Free headphones.

316
00:08:25,767 --> 00:08:28,395
Looks like my wife left me

317
00:08:25,767 --> 00:08:28,395
a month too soon.

318
00:08:28,437 --> 00:08:29,646
(laughs)

319
00:08:31,523 --> 00:08:35,318
(stammers) So you weren't even

320
00:08:31,523 --> 00:08:35,318
thinking about super-asymmetry?

321
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,028
Thinking about it?

322
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,028
(chuckles)

323
00:08:37,070 --> 00:08:38,988
We don't even

324
00:08:37,070 --> 00:08:38,988
understand it.

325
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:41,116
(both laugh)

326
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:41,116
PEMBERTON: And

327
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:41,116
now look at

328
00:08:41,157 --> 00:08:43,619
the four of us,

329
00:08:41,157 --> 00:08:43,619
changing the face of physics!

330
00:08:43,660 --> 00:08:45,328
Ooh, I got to do it.

331
00:08:52,335 --> 00:08:55,464
Oh, man, that last episode of

332
00:08:52,335 --> 00:08:55,464
Star Trek: Discovery was crazy.

333
00:08:55,505 --> 00:08:57,048
Whoa, whoa, whoa,

334
00:08:55,505 --> 00:08:57,048
I-I'm actually one behind.

335
00:08:57,090 --> 00:08:59,008
I haven't started

336
00:08:57,090 --> 00:08:59,008
the new season yet.

337
00:09:00,969 --> 00:09:02,345
Ooh, uh, how about

338
00:09:00,969 --> 00:09:02,345
this week's Walking Dead?

339
00:09:02,387 --> 00:09:03,555
Two behind.

340
00:09:03,597 --> 00:09:04,931
Three behind.

341
00:09:06,642 --> 00:09:08,226
Black Mirror?

342
00:09:06,642 --> 00:09:08,226
No.

343
00:09:08,268 --> 00:09:09,811
No.

344
00:09:09,852 --> 00:09:12,063
Come on, there must be

345
00:09:09,852 --> 00:09:12,063
something we've all seen.

346
00:09:12,105 --> 00:09:14,399
Oh, how about that video

347
00:09:12,105 --> 00:09:14,399
of my dog I sent you,

348
00:09:14,441 --> 00:09:17,319
where she's growling

349
00:09:14,441 --> 00:09:17,319
at a pinecone?

350
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,987
I actually hadn't

351
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,987
watched it yet,

352
00:09:19,028 --> 00:09:20,989
but thanks

353
00:09:19,028 --> 00:09:20,989
for ruining the ending.

354
00:09:21,864 --> 00:09:23,659
Uh, can you believe this?

355
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:26,035
Doctors Pemberton and Campbell

356
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:26,035
have been doing a press tour

357
00:09:26,077 --> 00:09:27,996
trying to take credit

358
00:09:26,077 --> 00:09:27,996
for super-asymmetry.

359
00:09:28,037 --> 00:09:29,706
They didn't even know

360
00:09:28,037 --> 00:09:29,706
what they were finding.

361
00:09:29,748 --> 00:09:32,167
So what? I mean, no one's

362
00:09:29,748 --> 00:09:32,167
gonna give them credit

363
00:09:32,208 --> 00:09:33,418
for accidentally

364
00:09:32,208 --> 00:09:33,418
discovering something.

365
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:35,462
WOLOWITZ:

366
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:35,462
Yeah, who remembers the guy

367
00:09:35,504 --> 00:09:38,340
who was trying to find India

368
00:09:35,504 --> 00:09:38,340
and discovered America instead?

369
00:09:38,381 --> 00:09:40,091
What was his name again?

370
00:09:38,381 --> 00:09:40,091
(chuckles)

371
00:09:40,133 --> 00:09:42,969
But this is different.

372
00:09:43,011 --> 00:09:45,138
Sheldon, super-asymmetry

373
00:09:43,011 --> 00:09:45,138
is your paper.

374
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:46,807
Everyone knows

375
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:46,807
you were there first.

376
00:09:46,848 --> 00:09:50,393
Mm, actually, the Nobel

377
00:09:46,848 --> 00:09:50,393
Committee has sometimes favored

378
00:09:50,435 --> 00:09:53,772
experimentalists like them

379
00:09:50,435 --> 00:09:53,772
over theoreticians like you.

380
00:09:53,814 --> 00:09:56,107
No, that's just

381
00:09:53,814 --> 00:09:56,107
a scary campfire story

382
00:09:56,149 --> 00:09:57,859
like the guy with the hook.

383
00:09:59,861 --> 00:10:01,154
No, i-it's true.

384
00:10:01,196 --> 00:10:02,823
The scientists

385
00:10:01,196 --> 00:10:02,823
that proved the big bang,

386
00:10:02,864 --> 00:10:05,575
they thought their sensors

387
00:10:02,864 --> 00:10:05,575
needed cleaning

388
00:10:05,617 --> 00:10:07,869
until someone pointed out

389
00:10:05,617 --> 00:10:07,869
that they were picking up

390
00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:10,580
cosmic background radiation

391
00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:10,580
from the singularity.

392
00:10:10,622 --> 00:10:11,998
They won the Nobel.

393
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:14,083
Not the scientists

394
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:14,083
that came up with the theory.

395
00:10:14,125 --> 00:10:17,003
So you're saying they could

396
00:10:14,125 --> 00:10:17,003
steal our Nobel Prize?

397
00:10:17,045 --> 00:10:19,548
Yes.

398
00:10:17,045 --> 00:10:19,548
That's terrible.

399
00:10:21,049 --> 00:10:22,342
Good news, though:

400
00:10:22,384 --> 00:10:24,302
Now we have something

401
00:10:22,384 --> 00:10:24,302
we can talk about.

402
00:10:27,930 --> 00:10:29,307
Hey, you wanted

403
00:10:27,930 --> 00:10:29,307
to see me?

404
00:10:29,349 --> 00:10:31,351
Yeah, come on in.

405
00:10:29,349 --> 00:10:31,351
Okay.

406
00:10:31,393 --> 00:10:33,019
Close the door.

407
00:10:33,061 --> 00:10:34,896
Okay.

408
00:10:37,774 --> 00:10:38,859
Have a seat.

409
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:40,694
Do I have to?

410
00:10:40,736 --> 00:10:42,571
You really do.

411
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:47,868
So, I talked

412
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:47,868
to your supervisor,

413
00:10:47,909 --> 00:10:50,203
and she said that she

414
00:10:47,909 --> 00:10:50,203
never stopped you

415
00:10:50,245 --> 00:10:52,997
from working on my team,

416
00:10:50,245 --> 00:10:52,997
because you never asked her.

417
00:10:53,039 --> 00:10:54,541
Really?

418
00:10:54,583 --> 00:10:56,042
Oh, you know, you should know,

419
00:10:56,084 --> 00:10:57,836
she's been taking

420
00:10:56,084 --> 00:10:57,836
our new antidepressant,

421
00:10:57,878 --> 00:11:01,089
and lying is one

422
00:10:57,878 --> 00:11:01,089
of the main side effects.

423
00:11:01,130 --> 00:11:03,592
Why don't you want

424
00:11:01,130 --> 00:11:03,592
to work with me?

425
00:11:03,633 --> 00:11:05,761
I know I can be tough,

426
00:11:03,633 --> 00:11:05,761
but that's just 'cause

427
00:11:05,802 --> 00:11:08,221
I'm surrounded by

428
00:11:05,802 --> 00:11:08,221
useless idiots.

429
00:11:08,263 --> 00:11:10,306
No, it's not that.

430
00:11:10,348 --> 00:11:11,558
Then why?

431
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:14,185
Honestly, I don't know

432
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:14,185
if I'm up to it.

433
00:11:14,227 --> 00:11:16,020
You know,

434
00:11:14,227 --> 00:11:16,020
the last project I managed

435
00:11:16,062 --> 00:11:18,189
was my high school yearbook.

436
00:11:16,062 --> 00:11:18,189
And?

437
00:11:18,231 --> 00:11:21,484
And that was the year

438
00:11:18,231 --> 00:11:21,484
we didn't have one.

439
00:11:21,526 --> 00:11:23,069
Apparently, the printers

440
00:11:21,526 --> 00:11:23,069
won't make them

441
00:11:23,111 --> 00:11:24,654
without getting paid.

442
00:11:24,696 --> 00:11:26,114
What happened to the money?

443
00:11:26,155 --> 00:11:27,449
Uh, if I didn't know then,

444
00:11:27,490 --> 00:11:28,991
I'm not gonna magically

445
00:11:27,490 --> 00:11:28,991
know now.

446
00:11:29,033 --> 00:11:31,536
Plus, you know,

447
00:11:29,033 --> 00:11:31,536
I didn't go to college.

448
00:11:31,578 --> 00:11:33,663
I'd be in charge of people

449
00:11:31,578 --> 00:11:33,663
that are far more educated

450
00:11:33,705 --> 00:11:35,956
with more experience;

451
00:11:33,705 --> 00:11:35,956
what if they don't listen to me?

452
00:11:35,998 --> 00:11:37,626
Then you be really mean to them.

453
00:11:37,667 --> 00:11:39,294
Have I taught you nothing?

454
00:11:40,462 --> 00:11:42,464
Penny, everybody

455
00:11:40,462 --> 00:11:42,464
feels like you do.

456
00:11:42,505 --> 00:11:43,799
Like they're not good enough,

457
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:45,634
not smart enough.

458
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:45,634
What, even you?

459
00:11:45,675 --> 00:11:47,968
Of course.

460
00:11:45,675 --> 00:11:47,968
Dr. Rostenkowski,

461
00:11:45,675 --> 00:11:47,968
you wanted me...

462
00:11:48,010 --> 00:11:50,680
Hey, did they not teach

463
00:11:48,010 --> 00:11:50,680
knocking at Stanford? Get out!

464
00:11:53,475 --> 00:11:55,143
(chuckles) I love that kid.

465
00:11:59,522 --> 00:12:00,732
There you are.

466
00:12:00,774 --> 00:12:02,442
Dr. Cooper, hello.

467
00:12:02,484 --> 00:12:05,361
Hello to you, too. Now stop

468
00:12:02,484 --> 00:12:05,361
trying to steal our Nobel Prize.

469
00:12:05,403 --> 00:12:06,780
You come up with your own idea.

470
00:12:06,822 --> 00:12:08,698
Yeah, that's not gonna happen.

471
00:12:10,032 --> 00:12:11,827
Wouldn't that

472
00:12:10,032 --> 00:12:11,827
be something, though?

473
00:12:12,828 --> 00:12:14,245
Well, too bad.

474
00:12:14,287 --> 00:12:16,581
This discovery belongs

475
00:12:14,287 --> 00:12:16,581
to Amy and me.

476
00:12:14,287 --> 00:12:16,581
(sighs)

477
00:12:16,623 --> 00:12:19,208
Look, Dr. Cooper, we all

478
00:12:16,623 --> 00:12:19,208
want a Nobel Prize.

479
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:21,461
Super-asymmetry could be the

480
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:21,461
breakthrough that gets us there.

481
00:12:21,503 --> 00:12:24,255
But we can't fight over credit;

482
00:12:21,503 --> 00:12:24,255
we have to work together.

483
00:12:24,297 --> 00:12:26,549
So...

484
00:12:26,591 --> 00:12:28,510
you're saying

485
00:12:26,591 --> 00:12:28,510
that the four of us

486
00:12:28,551 --> 00:12:31,763
should just agree

487
00:12:28,551 --> 00:12:31,763
to share this discovery?

488
00:12:31,805 --> 00:12:33,682
Well, no,

489
00:12:31,805 --> 00:12:33,682
unfortunately,

490
00:12:33,723 --> 00:12:35,642
only three people

491
00:12:33,723 --> 00:12:35,642
can share a Nobel.

492
00:12:35,684 --> 00:12:37,310
Oh, that's right.

493
00:12:39,479 --> 00:12:40,814
So he's out?

494
00:12:42,106 --> 00:12:44,192
No, I'm not out.

495
00:12:45,527 --> 00:12:47,904
So he's out?

496
00:12:47,946 --> 00:12:49,197
Neither of us is out.

497
00:12:49,238 --> 00:12:50,949
We think that

498
00:12:49,238 --> 00:12:50,949
the three physicists

499
00:12:50,991 --> 00:12:53,910
should be the ones to win

500
00:12:50,991 --> 00:12:53,910
the Nobel Prize for physics.

501
00:12:55,035 --> 00:12:56,913
Wait, so you want

502
00:12:55,035 --> 00:12:56,913
to cut Amy out?

503
00:12:56,955 --> 00:12:58,373
No, of course not.

504
00:12:58,414 --> 00:13:00,709
We don't want to,

505
00:12:58,414 --> 00:13:00,709
but we're going to.

506
00:13:01,877 --> 00:13:03,294
But she's my wife.

507
00:13:03,336 --> 00:13:05,129
Yes, exactly,

508
00:13:03,336 --> 00:13:05,129
she's your wife.

509
00:13:05,171 --> 00:13:06,798
And she's a neuroscientist.

510
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:09,425
It's like, what's she

511
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:09,425
even doing on this paper?

512
00:13:11,093 --> 00:13:14,138
It just raises questions.

513
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:15,557
Look, Fermilab

514
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:15,557
is going to recommend

515
00:13:15,598 --> 00:13:17,517
the three of us

516
00:13:15,598 --> 00:13:17,517
to the Nobel Committee.

517
00:13:17,559 --> 00:13:20,562
The best chance we have is if

518
00:13:17,559 --> 00:13:20,562
your university does the same.

519
00:13:23,023 --> 00:13:25,859
I see.

520
00:13:25,901 --> 00:13:27,944
So you really think that

521
00:13:25,901 --> 00:13:27,944
I'm the kind of man who would

522
00:13:27,986 --> 00:13:29,362
sell out his partner

523
00:13:27,986 --> 00:13:29,362
for the chance

524
00:13:29,404 --> 00:13:30,739
of winning a Nobel Prize?

525
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:32,240
Are you?

526
00:13:33,157 --> 00:13:34,910
Boy, I hope not.

527
00:13:37,913 --> 00:13:39,414
I can't believe

528
00:13:37,913 --> 00:13:39,414
Penny doesn't want

529
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:41,791
to head up my

530
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:41,791
sales team.

531
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:41,791
That's too bad.

532
00:13:41,833 --> 00:13:44,252
But it's her decision,

533
00:13:41,833 --> 00:13:44,252
not yours.

534
00:13:44,293 --> 00:13:46,588
Do you hear how dumb you sound?

535
00:13:47,630 --> 00:13:49,925
Why does this matter

536
00:13:47,630 --> 00:13:49,925
to you so much?

537
00:13:49,966 --> 00:13:52,092
Because I believe in her,

538
00:13:49,966 --> 00:13:52,092
and I make people better.

539
00:13:52,134 --> 00:13:53,261
It's what I do.

540
00:13:53,302 --> 00:13:54,596
Against their will?

541
00:13:54,637 --> 00:13:56,264
It's no fun if they want to.

542
00:13:56,305 --> 00:13:57,974
That's just called watching.

543
00:13:58,975 --> 00:14:00,268
Look at Howard.

544
00:14:00,309 --> 00:14:02,020
He was a disaster

545
00:14:00,309 --> 00:14:02,020
when I met him.

546
00:14:02,062 --> 00:14:05,523
Now he's a foxy astronaut

547
00:14:02,062 --> 00:14:05,523
with a hot wife.

548
00:14:05,565 --> 00:14:07,776
Wait, he always wanted

549
00:14:05,565 --> 00:14:07,776
to be an astronaut.

550
00:14:07,817 --> 00:14:09,318
He thinks that, too.

551
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,362
That's how good I am.

552
00:14:12,530 --> 00:14:13,907
Wait, so what

553
00:14:12,530 --> 00:14:13,907
are you gonna do?

554
00:14:13,949 --> 00:14:15,450
Just badger her

555
00:14:13,949 --> 00:14:15,450
until she says yes?

556
00:14:15,491 --> 00:14:17,117
Mm, that may have worked on you,

557
00:14:17,159 --> 00:14:18,954
but she's too smart for that.

558
00:14:20,455 --> 00:14:22,415
Well, if you like fixing people,

559
00:14:20,455 --> 00:14:22,415
I could use some help.

560
00:14:22,457 --> 00:14:23,917
Raj.

561
00:14:23,959 --> 00:14:26,419
Why do you think you stopped

562
00:14:23,959 --> 00:14:26,419
wearing Crocs and socks?

563
00:14:26,461 --> 00:14:30,214
Uh, well, one day I just woke up

564
00:14:26,461 --> 00:14:30,214
and realized they looked silly.

565
00:14:30,256 --> 00:14:32,842
Yes, you did.

566
00:14:30,256 --> 00:14:32,842
All on your own.

567
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:36,345
(whispering):

568
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:36,345
That's how good I am.

569
00:14:40,349 --> 00:14:41,726
(clucking tongue)

570
00:14:41,768 --> 00:14:43,519
What's wrong?

571
00:14:43,561 --> 00:14:45,480
Why do you assume

572
00:14:43,561 --> 00:14:45,480
something's wrong?

573
00:14:45,521 --> 00:14:47,398
Because you haven't

574
00:14:45,521 --> 00:14:47,398
touched your dinner,

575
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:51,319
and you're literally ticking

576
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:51,319
like a bomb about to go off.

577
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,279
Oh, Amy.

578
00:14:53,321 --> 00:14:56,658
You see through me

579
00:14:53,321 --> 00:14:56,658
like one of Penny's shirts.

580
00:14:58,076 --> 00:14:59,744
Just tell me.

581
00:15:01,955 --> 00:15:04,165
I talked to Doctors Pemberton

582
00:15:01,955 --> 00:15:04,165
and Campbell today.

583
00:15:04,206 --> 00:15:07,961
They reminded me that only three

584
00:15:04,206 --> 00:15:07,961
people can share a Nobel Prize.

585
00:15:08,003 --> 00:15:09,963
Their university

586
00:15:08,003 --> 00:15:09,963
is recommending

587
00:15:10,005 --> 00:15:11,756
the two of them and me.

588
00:15:11,798 --> 00:15:14,009
And they want Caltech

589
00:15:11,798 --> 00:15:14,009
to do the same.

590
00:15:16,011 --> 00:15:17,637
Oh.

591
00:15:17,679 --> 00:15:19,722
They say, if we present

592
00:15:17,679 --> 00:15:19,722
a united front,

593
00:15:19,764 --> 00:15:22,058
we have a much better shot

594
00:15:19,764 --> 00:15:22,058
at winning.

595
00:15:24,019 --> 00:15:27,105
Well, you know,

596
00:15:24,019 --> 00:15:27,105
that makes sense.

597
00:15:27,147 --> 00:15:29,565
Oh, but don't worry.

598
00:15:27,147 --> 00:15:29,565
I won't do that to you.

599
00:15:33,277 --> 00:15:34,612
Maybe you should.

600
00:15:34,654 --> 00:15:36,364
What?

601
00:15:37,699 --> 00:15:39,993
This has been

602
00:15:37,699 --> 00:15:39,993
your lifelong dream.

603
00:15:40,035 --> 00:15:42,745
And you may not get

604
00:15:40,035 --> 00:15:42,745
another chance.

605
00:15:42,787 --> 00:15:45,874
I don't want to be the reason

606
00:15:42,787 --> 00:15:45,874
that you don't win a Nobel.

607
00:15:45,915 --> 00:15:49,544
You're the only

608
00:15:45,915 --> 00:15:49,544
reason I deserve one.

609
00:15:52,797 --> 00:15:54,841
But if your best shot

610
00:15:52,797 --> 00:15:54,841
is with them,

611
00:15:54,883 --> 00:15:56,551
I think you should take it.

612
00:15:58,219 --> 00:16:00,889
Is this really

613
00:15:58,219 --> 00:16:00,889
what you want me to do?

614
00:16:02,098 --> 00:16:04,934
I just want you to be happy.

615
00:16:06,102 --> 00:16:07,436
Thank you.

616
00:16:10,314 --> 00:16:12,441
(clicking tongue)

617
00:16:17,197 --> 00:16:19,490
Hey. How long have you

618
00:16:17,197 --> 00:16:19,490
been sitting there?

619
00:16:19,532 --> 00:16:21,450
Long enough for two

620
00:16:19,532 --> 00:16:21,450
of your neighbors to ask

621
00:16:21,492 --> 00:16:23,494
if I was lost

622
00:16:21,492 --> 00:16:23,494
and looking for my mother.

623
00:16:23,536 --> 00:16:26,081
I'm not changing my mind,

624
00:16:23,536 --> 00:16:26,081
Bernie.

625
00:16:26,122 --> 00:16:27,623
That's okay. I'm sorry.

626
00:16:27,665 --> 00:16:30,334
It was wrong of me to badger you

627
00:16:27,665 --> 00:16:30,334
into doing something

628
00:16:30,376 --> 00:16:31,586
that made you uncomfortable.

629
00:16:31,627 --> 00:16:32,837
Thank you.

630
00:16:32,879 --> 00:16:34,923
Mm, it's probably

631
00:16:32,879 --> 00:16:34,923
for the best.

632
00:16:34,964 --> 00:16:36,716
I need someone

633
00:16:34,964 --> 00:16:36,716
who's strong and confident

634
00:16:36,758 --> 00:16:39,427
to head up my sales team,

635
00:16:36,758 --> 00:16:39,427
so I'm giving it to Karen.

636
00:16:39,468 --> 00:16:41,930
What... Karen?

637
00:16:39,468 --> 00:16:41,930
Well, what's the job?

638
00:16:41,971 --> 00:16:45,474
Eating my yogurt and

639
00:16:41,971 --> 00:16:45,474
then lying about it?

640
00:16:45,516 --> 00:16:46,893
I'm just saying.

641
00:16:46,935 --> 00:16:48,978
She went to college.

642
00:16:46,935 --> 00:16:48,978
She's really smart.

643
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:50,563
Well, I'm smarter than Karen.

644
00:16:50,605 --> 00:16:54,192
I can read the word "Penny"

645
00:16:50,605 --> 00:16:54,192
on a cup of yogurt.

646
00:16:54,234 --> 00:16:55,818
Why are you getting so upset?

647
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:57,695
I'm agreeing with you.

648
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:57,695
This is a big job,

649
00:16:57,737 --> 00:16:59,530
and I need someone

650
00:16:57,737 --> 00:16:59,530
who's up to it.

651
00:16:59,572 --> 00:17:02,784
I am up to it.

652
00:16:59,572 --> 00:17:02,784
I'm just nervous about it.

653
00:16:59,572 --> 00:17:02,784
I know.

654
00:17:02,825 --> 00:17:04,660
And that's why

655
00:17:02,825 --> 00:17:04,660
I don't want to pressure you

656
00:17:04,702 --> 00:17:06,913
into doing something that you

657
00:17:04,702 --> 00:17:06,913
clearly don't want to do.

658
00:17:06,955 --> 00:17:08,748
I know what you're up to.

659
00:17:08,790 --> 00:17:10,708
Is it working?

660
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:12,627
Yes.

661
00:17:14,587 --> 00:17:18,216
So I'll see you

662
00:17:14,587 --> 00:17:18,216
Monday morning?

663
00:17:14,587 --> 00:17:18,216
Yes.

664
00:17:18,258 --> 00:17:21,094
I bet I can make

665
00:17:18,258 --> 00:17:21,094
that girl president.

666
00:17:23,345 --> 00:17:24,639
(intercom beeps)

667
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:25,807
RECEPTIONIST:

668
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:25,807
Uh, President Siebert,

669
00:17:25,848 --> 00:17:27,183
Dr. Cooper is...

670
00:17:27,225 --> 00:17:29,477
I need to talk to

671
00:17:27,225 --> 00:17:29,477
you about the paper

672
00:17:29,518 --> 00:17:31,020
that Dr. Fowler

673
00:17:29,518 --> 00:17:31,020
and I published.

674
00:17:31,062 --> 00:17:32,605
Send him in.

675
00:17:32,647 --> 00:17:34,065
Amy and I did this together,

676
00:17:34,107 --> 00:17:36,109
and I will not

677
00:17:34,107 --> 00:17:36,109
be part of an award

678
00:17:36,151 --> 00:17:38,069
that does not recognize

679
00:17:36,151 --> 00:17:38,069
the value of her contributions.

680
00:17:38,111 --> 00:17:40,738
So you either include both of us

681
00:17:38,111 --> 00:17:40,738
in the recommendation letter,

682
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:42,240
or don't bother writing one.

683
00:17:42,282 --> 00:17:44,492
I hope you know

684
00:17:42,282 --> 00:17:44,492
that's going to cause a fight

685
00:17:44,533 --> 00:17:46,368
between us

686
00:17:44,533 --> 00:17:46,368
and the Fermilab team.

687
00:17:46,410 --> 00:17:48,746
If it's a fight that doesn't

688
00:17:46,410 --> 00:17:48,746
involve any touching,

689
00:17:48,788 --> 00:17:50,999
risk of physical harm

690
00:17:48,788 --> 00:17:50,999
or uncomfortable eye contact

691
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:53,042
'cause it's happening online

692
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:53,042
or through intermediaries,

693
00:17:53,084 --> 00:17:54,794
I say bring it.

694
00:17:54,836 --> 00:17:57,338
All right.

695
00:17:54,836 --> 00:17:57,338
I respect your decision.

696
00:17:57,379 --> 00:17:59,299
You do?

697
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:01,968
Yes. You and Dr. Fowler

698
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:01,968
have my full support.

699
00:18:02,010 --> 00:18:04,095
Oh, okay.

700
00:18:04,137 --> 00:18:06,639
I anticipated

701
00:18:04,137 --> 00:18:06,639
a little more pushback.

702
00:18:06,681 --> 00:18:09,100
Sorry, my job here

703
00:18:06,681 --> 00:18:09,100
is to serve your needs,

704
00:18:09,142 --> 00:18:10,601
both academic and personal.

705
00:18:10,643 --> 00:18:13,188
Huh.

706
00:18:13,229 --> 00:18:15,064
Well, now I'm filled with

707
00:18:13,229 --> 00:18:15,064
all this nervous energy.

708
00:18:15,106 --> 00:18:17,108
I don't know quite

709
00:18:15,106 --> 00:18:17,108
what to do with it.

710
00:18:17,150 --> 00:18:19,360
We have a fully equipped

711
00:18:17,150 --> 00:18:19,360
gymnasium.

712
00:18:19,401 --> 00:18:21,070
Yeah... Really?

713
00:18:21,112 --> 00:18:23,114
Where's that?

714
00:18:23,156 --> 00:18:24,824
It's part of the new

715
00:18:23,156 --> 00:18:24,824
sports complex.

716
00:18:24,866 --> 00:18:26,784
Oh.

717
00:18:26,826 --> 00:18:28,577
And where is that?

718
00:18:28,619 --> 00:18:30,288
Come on, I'll show you.

719
00:18:32,748 --> 00:18:34,458
Are there monkey bars?

720
00:18:38,171 --> 00:18:39,588
All right, now,

721
00:18:38,171 --> 00:18:39,588
I'm sure some of you

722
00:18:39,630 --> 00:18:41,382
are wondering,

723
00:18:39,630 --> 00:18:41,382
"Who is this woman?

724
00:18:41,423 --> 00:18:43,885
"How did she get to be

725
00:18:41,423 --> 00:18:43,885
in charge of the sales team?

726
00:18:43,926 --> 00:18:46,470
Is it because she's friends

727
00:18:43,926 --> 00:18:46,470
with Dr. Rostenkowski?"

728
00:18:46,512 --> 00:18:48,723
Because she is.

729
00:18:48,764 --> 00:18:51,267
"Is it because she was

730
00:18:48,764 --> 00:18:51,267
Miss Cornhusker 2001

731
00:18:51,309 --> 00:18:53,686
and still fits

732
00:18:51,309 --> 00:18:53,686
in those very same jeans?"

733
00:18:53,728 --> 00:18:55,271
'Cause she was, and she does,

734
00:18:55,313 --> 00:18:57,065
and they're actually

735
00:18:55,313 --> 00:18:57,065
a little baggy.

736
00:18:58,649 --> 00:19:01,152
Or is it because she's

737
00:18:58,649 --> 00:19:01,152
the best damn salesperson here?

738
00:19:01,194 --> 00:19:02,486
Because I am.

739
00:19:02,528 --> 00:19:04,530
Now that we're clear on that,

740
00:19:04,572 --> 00:19:06,115
here are the drug specs

741
00:19:06,157 --> 00:19:08,159
and marketing strategy

742
00:19:06,157 --> 00:19:08,159
for Inflamminex.

743
00:19:08,201 --> 00:19:11,453
Which, now that I say it out

744
00:19:08,201 --> 00:19:11,453
loud, might be a placeholder.

745
00:19:11,495 --> 00:19:14,082
By tomorrow, I want everyone to

746
00:19:11,495 --> 00:19:14,082
have this committed to memory.

747
00:19:14,123 --> 00:19:16,125
Do you have it

748
00:19:14,123 --> 00:19:16,125
committed to memory?

749
00:19:16,167 --> 00:19:18,169
You want to have

750
00:19:16,167 --> 00:19:18,169
a contest, Karen?

751
00:19:18,211 --> 00:19:20,380
Winner gets a yogurt.

752
00:19:21,547 --> 00:19:22,924
No, boss.

753
00:19:22,965 --> 00:19:25,426
All right, now we all know

754
00:19:22,965 --> 00:19:25,426
what we need to do.

755
00:19:25,467 --> 00:19:26,761
Let's go do it.

756
00:19:28,054 --> 00:19:30,723
R-Right now.

757
00:19:28,054 --> 00:19:30,723
Get out of here. Go.

758
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:34,394
That was

759
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:34,394
really impressive.

760
00:19:34,435 --> 00:19:35,895
Damn right it

761
00:19:34,435 --> 00:19:35,895
was impressive.

762
00:19:35,937 --> 00:19:37,230
Okay, that tone

763
00:19:35,937 --> 00:19:37,230
doesn't work with me.

764
00:19:37,272 --> 00:19:38,814
Sorry, boss.
