1
00:00:06,046 --> 00:00:07,047
Previously on

2
00:00:06,046 --> 00:00:07,047
The Big Bang Theory...

3
00:00:07,089 --> 00:00:08,965
We conclusively proved

4
00:00:07,089 --> 00:00:08,965
super-asymmetry,

5
00:00:09,007 --> 00:00:11,761
and yet somehow we-we still

6
00:00:09,007 --> 00:00:11,761
feel like imposters.

7
00:00:11,802 --> 00:00:13,721
Yeah, there should be

8
00:00:11,802 --> 00:00:13,721
a term for that.

9
00:00:13,763 --> 00:00:16,724
Oh, for crying out loud,

10
00:00:13,763 --> 00:00:16,724
there is a term for that!

11
00:00:16,766 --> 00:00:18,768
It's called

12
00:00:16,766 --> 00:00:18,768
"imposter syndrome,"

13
00:00:18,809 --> 00:00:20,936
and you don't have it,

14
00:00:18,809 --> 00:00:20,936
because you can't have it

15
00:00:20,977 --> 00:00:23,105
if you are imposters,

16
00:00:20,977 --> 00:00:23,105
and you are!

17
00:00:23,146 --> 00:00:26,024
We're the ones

18
00:00:23,146 --> 00:00:26,024
who discovered super-asymmetry,

19
00:00:26,066 --> 00:00:28,402
so if anyone's gonna feel like

20
00:00:26,066 --> 00:00:28,402
they have imposter syndrome,

21
00:00:28,444 --> 00:00:32,155
it's us, because we're

22
00:00:28,444 --> 00:00:32,155
not imposters, they are!

23
00:00:32,197 --> 00:00:35,117
You're imposters

24
00:00:32,197 --> 00:00:35,117
and you're frauds!

25
00:00:41,039 --> 00:00:42,625
Is that what I

26
00:00:41,039 --> 00:00:42,625
would've sounded like?

27
00:00:42,666 --> 00:00:44,585
Yeah.

28
00:00:42,666 --> 00:00:44,585
Yikes.

29
00:00:46,837 --> 00:00:48,171
Sheldon, look at this.

30
00:00:48,213 --> 00:00:49,882
(stammers)

31
00:00:48,213 --> 00:00:49,882
Wait a minute.

32
00:00:49,924 --> 00:00:52,134
How do I know this isn't

33
00:00:49,924 --> 00:00:52,134
one of those joke phones

34
00:00:52,175 --> 00:00:54,303
that squirts water in my face?

35
00:00:54,344 --> 00:00:56,931
Because that's

36
00:00:54,344 --> 00:00:56,931
not even a thing. Look.

37
00:01:00,476 --> 00:01:03,353
You got called

38
00:01:00,476 --> 00:01:03,353
into human resources?

39
00:01:03,395 --> 00:01:05,230
I'm sure it's because I insulted

40
00:01:03,395 --> 00:01:05,230
Pemberton and Campbell

41
00:01:05,272 --> 00:01:07,107
in a room full

42
00:01:05,272 --> 00:01:07,107
of Nobel Laureates.

43
00:01:07,149 --> 00:01:09,735
You did do that.

44
00:01:09,777 --> 00:01:13,322
It was awkward. People

45
00:01:09,777 --> 00:01:13,322
didn't know where to look.

46
00:01:13,363 --> 00:01:15,073
This is a twist.

47
00:01:15,115 --> 00:01:16,575
Usually you're the one

48
00:01:15,115 --> 00:01:16,575
getting called into H.R.

49
00:01:16,617 --> 00:01:18,285
KOOTHRAPPALI:

50
00:01:16,617 --> 00:01:18,285
Yeah, now it's Amy.

51
00:01:18,327 --> 00:01:21,413
Who knew you were married

52
00:01:18,327 --> 00:01:21,413
to such a bad girl.

53
00:01:21,455 --> 00:01:23,540
I suppose the signs

54
00:01:21,455 --> 00:01:23,540
were always there.

55
00:01:23,582 --> 00:01:26,418
I mean, she did recently

56
00:01:23,582 --> 00:01:26,418
go to that rave at the mall.

57
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:29,505
It was a Spencer's Gifts.

58
00:01:29,546 --> 00:01:31,674
There was music

59
00:01:29,546 --> 00:01:31,674
and a strobe light.

60
00:01:31,715 --> 00:01:33,509
If that isn't a rave,

61
00:01:31,715 --> 00:01:33,509
then I don't know what one is.

62
00:01:34,718 --> 00:01:36,679
You don't know

63
00:01:34,718 --> 00:01:36,679
what one is.

64
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,388
Guys, come on,

65
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,388
I think I'm in trouble.

66
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:40,850
It's no big deal. I used

67
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:40,850
to get called into H.R.

68
00:01:40,891 --> 00:01:42,643
all the time.

69
00:01:40,891 --> 00:01:42,643
Ms. Davis is great.

70
00:01:42,685 --> 00:01:45,270
Pro tip: if you find

71
00:01:42,685 --> 00:01:45,270
strong women sexy,

72
00:01:45,312 --> 00:01:47,063
do not say it out loud.

73
00:01:47,105 --> 00:01:49,900
(phone chimes)

74
00:01:51,861 --> 00:01:54,029
Oh! She wants to see me, too.

75
00:01:54,070 --> 00:01:55,698
All right, let's get

76
00:01:54,070 --> 00:01:55,698
our story straight:

77
00:01:55,739 --> 00:01:56,991
This is all your fault.

78
00:01:57,032 --> 00:01:58,701
Relax.

79
00:01:58,742 --> 00:02:00,786
You're probably just gonna

80
00:01:58,742 --> 00:02:00,786
get a slap on the wrist.

81
00:02:00,828 --> 00:02:04,247
Maybe, but do not ask for that,

82
00:02:00,828 --> 00:02:04,247
on the wrist or anywhere else.

83
00:02:04,289 --> 00:02:07,877

Thank you both for coming.

98
00:02:30,065 --> 00:02:33,151
President Siebert asked that

99
00:02:30,065 --> 00:02:33,151
I be a part of this conversation

100
00:02:33,193 --> 00:02:36,112
to help us calmly

101
00:02:33,193 --> 00:02:36,112
discuss what went wrong

102
00:02:36,154 --> 00:02:37,614
and how we can

103
00:02:36,154 --> 00:02:37,614
better move forward.

104
00:02:37,656 --> 00:02:39,742
We are not here

105
00:02:37,656 --> 00:02:39,742
to point fingers,

106
00:02:39,783 --> 00:02:42,118
so, Dr. Cooper,

107
00:02:39,783 --> 00:02:42,118
please stop that.

108
00:02:46,665 --> 00:02:48,625
President Siebert,

109
00:02:46,665 --> 00:02:48,625
would you like to start?

110
00:02:48,667 --> 00:02:51,127
(clears throat)

111
00:02:48,667 --> 00:02:51,127
This is all my fault.

112
00:02:51,169 --> 00:02:53,630
I assumed you knew

113
00:02:51,169 --> 00:02:53,630
the Nobel Prize was good

114
00:02:53,672 --> 00:02:56,759
and we wanted to win it,

115
00:02:53,672 --> 00:02:56,759
so that's on me.

116
00:02:59,511 --> 00:03:01,388
Oh, so...

117
00:02:59,511 --> 00:03:01,388
No.

118
00:03:03,097 --> 00:03:06,226
I think what President Siebert

119
00:03:03,097 --> 00:03:06,226
is trying to say is that

120
00:03:06,268 --> 00:03:09,396
this is a setback and we should

121
00:03:06,268 --> 00:03:09,396
adopt a different strategy.

122
00:03:09,438 --> 00:03:11,398
Like maybe you two

123
00:03:09,438 --> 00:03:11,398
keep your traps shut.

124
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:15,360
"Traps." That's a fun old word.

125
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:15,360
Where's that been?

126
00:03:15,402 --> 00:03:18,447
I-I'm sorry.

127
00:03:15,402 --> 00:03:18,447
I-I just— I-I snapped.

128
00:03:18,488 --> 00:03:21,075
Oh, you're sorry!

129
00:03:18,488 --> 00:03:21,075
It's all better then!

130
00:03:21,115 --> 00:03:23,869
Listen up, you have a shot

131
00:03:21,115 --> 00:03:23,869
to win a Nobel Prize,

132
00:03:23,911 --> 00:03:25,245
and you're blowing it.

133
00:03:25,287 --> 00:03:27,497
I think what President Siebert

134
00:03:25,287 --> 00:03:27,497
is trying to say

135
00:03:27,539 --> 00:03:30,000
is that you have a shot

136
00:03:27,539 --> 00:03:30,000
to win a Nobel Prize

137
00:03:30,042 --> 00:03:32,502
and you're blowing it.

138
00:03:32,544 --> 00:03:35,965
Uh, that's exactly

139
00:03:32,544 --> 00:03:35,965
what he said.

140
00:03:36,006 --> 00:03:38,884
Yes, but I said it

141
00:03:36,006 --> 00:03:38,884
in my calming H.R. voice.

142
00:03:40,677 --> 00:03:43,346
The science world is

143
00:03:40,677 --> 00:03:43,346
a small community. People talk.

144
00:03:43,388 --> 00:03:46,516
I'm sure by now everyone knows

145
00:03:43,388 --> 00:03:46,516
about your tantrum.

146
00:03:46,558 --> 00:03:48,727
All right, well,

147
00:03:46,558 --> 00:03:48,727
what can we do?

148
00:03:46,558 --> 00:03:48,727
Nothing.

149
00:03:48,769 --> 00:03:50,479
Let me make this

150
00:03:48,769 --> 00:03:50,479
absolutely clear for you.

151
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:52,439
You two are done talking.

152
00:03:52,481 --> 00:03:55,358
We're canceling your speaking

153
00:03:52,481 --> 00:03:55,358
engagements and your interviews.

154
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:58,487
You're gonna lie low

155
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:58,487
and let us do damage control.

156
00:03:58,528 --> 00:04:01,448
Well, if that's what you want,

157
00:03:58,528 --> 00:04:01,448
that's what we'll do.

158
00:04:01,490 --> 00:04:04,367
You two winning the Nobel Prize

159
00:04:01,490 --> 00:04:04,367
is very important to us,

160
00:04:04,409 --> 00:04:06,078
and not just

161
00:04:04,409 --> 00:04:06,078
to the university.

162
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:08,956
Dr. Fowler, you would be

163
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:08,956
only the fourth woman

164
00:04:08,998 --> 00:04:10,749
to win a Nobel Prize in physics.

165
00:04:10,791 --> 00:04:12,542
I don't need

166
00:04:10,791 --> 00:04:12,542
to tell you

167
00:04:12,584 --> 00:04:13,877
just how inspirational

168
00:04:12,584 --> 00:04:13,877
that would be

169
00:04:13,919 --> 00:04:15,545
to a generation of young women.

170
00:04:15,587 --> 00:04:17,506
Uh, yes, of-of course, I know.

171
00:04:19,049 --> 00:04:20,968
So, the next words

172
00:04:19,049 --> 00:04:20,968
out of your mouth

173
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:23,053
should be on a stage in

174
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:23,053
Stockholm when you're saying...

175
00:04:23,095 --> 00:04:24,805
(speaks Swedish)

176
00:04:24,847 --> 00:04:27,516
which is Swedish for,

177
00:04:24,847 --> 00:04:27,516
"Thank you for this honor."

178
00:04:27,557 --> 00:04:29,685
(speaks Swedish)

179
00:04:29,726 --> 00:04:31,478
which is Swedish for,

180
00:04:29,726 --> 00:04:31,478
"I knew that."

181
00:04:33,396 --> 00:04:34,857
Dr. Cooper...

182
00:04:34,898 --> 00:04:36,608
You want me to shut my trap?

183
00:04:34,898 --> 00:04:36,608
I do.

184
00:04:39,153 --> 00:04:41,030
Hey, check it out.

185
00:04:41,071 --> 00:04:43,907
That looks like the moped

186
00:04:41,071 --> 00:04:43,907
you used to have.

187
00:04:43,949 --> 00:04:46,242
It wasn't a moped.

188
00:04:43,949 --> 00:04:46,242
It was a scooter.

189
00:04:46,284 --> 00:04:48,411
How's that better?

190
00:04:46,284 --> 00:04:48,411
(scoffs)

191
00:04:48,453 --> 00:04:50,497
You do not want to walk

192
00:04:48,453 --> 00:04:50,497
into a scooter bar

193
00:04:50,539 --> 00:04:52,541
and ask that question.

194
00:04:52,582 --> 00:04:54,960
Well, does

195
00:04:52,582 --> 00:04:54,960
take me back.

196
00:04:55,002 --> 00:04:58,338
Yeah, the two of us, cruising

197
00:04:55,002 --> 00:04:58,338
around town looking for women.

198
00:04:58,380 --> 00:04:59,506
Looking

199
00:04:59,548 --> 00:05:02,592
and looking and looking.

200
00:05:02,634 --> 00:05:05,220
Remember that time

201
00:05:02,634 --> 00:05:05,220
one looked back and said hi?

202
00:05:05,261 --> 00:05:07,014
Oh, yeah.

203
00:05:07,056 --> 00:05:09,683
We drove away

204
00:05:07,056 --> 00:05:09,683
so fast.

205
00:05:09,725 --> 00:05:12,978
Hey, I forget,

206
00:05:09,725 --> 00:05:12,978
why did you sell the scooter?

207
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:16,356
I finally got my woman.

208
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:16,356
(chuckles)

209
00:05:16,398 --> 00:05:18,067
Then my woman made me sell it.

210
00:05:21,195 --> 00:05:23,279
So apparently,

211
00:05:21,195 --> 00:05:23,279
if we win,

212
00:05:23,321 --> 00:05:26,158
I'll be the fourth woman ever

213
00:05:23,321 --> 00:05:26,158
to win a Nobel in physics.

214
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:28,160
Wow, that's a big deal.

215
00:05:28,202 --> 00:05:29,745
Yeah, tell me about it.

216
00:05:28,202 --> 00:05:29,745
This morning,

217
00:05:29,786 --> 00:05:33,082
I blew through my antiperspirant

218
00:05:29,786 --> 00:05:33,082
in, like, an hour.

219
00:05:35,291 --> 00:05:37,836
Plus, Sheldon's freaking out

220
00:05:35,291 --> 00:05:37,836
'cause we got in trouble.

221
00:05:37,878 --> 00:05:41,006
Well, I've got him

222
00:05:37,878 --> 00:05:41,006
distracted for a while.

223
00:05:41,048 --> 00:05:42,758
Doesn't he know

224
00:05:41,048 --> 00:05:42,758
how to solve those?

225
00:05:42,799 --> 00:05:47,554
Normally, yes, but I switched

226
00:05:42,799 --> 00:05:47,554
the stickers around, so...

227
00:05:47,596 --> 00:05:49,806
I don't even think

228
00:05:47,596 --> 00:05:49,806
it's possible to solve...

229
00:05:49,848 --> 00:05:50,849
Solved it.

230
00:05:52,308 --> 00:05:54,228
What? No, you didn't.

231
00:05:54,268 --> 00:05:56,980
Not the cube, but the puzzle of

232
00:05:54,268 --> 00:05:56,980
why I couldn't solve the cube.

233
00:05:57,022 --> 00:05:58,648
Solution:

234
00:05:58,690 --> 00:06:03,028
you switched stickers

235
00:05:58,690 --> 00:06:03,028
two, nine, 32, and 51.

236
00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:04,863
Really? This thing has numbers?

237
00:06:04,905 --> 00:06:06,907
Anything has a number

238
00:06:04,905 --> 00:06:06,907
if you assign it a number,

239
00:06:06,949 --> 00:06:07,866
friend number four.

240
00:06:10,911 --> 00:06:12,121
Top five, not bad.

241
00:06:12,162 --> 00:06:13,789
This is so frustrating.

242
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:15,331
I can't believe

243
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:15,331
the university expects us

244
00:06:15,373 --> 00:06:16,833
to just sit back and do nothing.

245
00:06:16,875 --> 00:06:18,085
Sweetie, you just need to relax.

246
00:06:18,127 --> 00:06:19,878
You know what I like to do?

247
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,964
Numb your brain with alcohol

248
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,964
and watch a reality show

249
00:06:22,005 --> 00:06:24,841
where wealthy people pick

250
00:06:22,005 --> 00:06:24,841
fake arguments with each other?

251
00:06:24,883 --> 00:06:26,969
Hey, don't knock it

252
00:06:24,883 --> 00:06:26,969
until you've wasted

253
00:06:27,010 --> 00:06:28,804
a couple hundred hours

254
00:06:27,010 --> 00:06:28,804
of your life.

255
00:06:28,845 --> 00:06:32,141
I'm sorry, but this is,

256
00:06:28,845 --> 00:06:32,141
it's hard for me.

257
00:06:32,182 --> 00:06:34,308
Usually I self-soothe

258
00:06:32,182 --> 00:06:34,308
by doing science,

259
00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:36,979
but now science reminds me

260
00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:36,979
of the Nobel Prize

261
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:39,815
and the idea that we may not win

262
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:39,815
one, and that makes me angry,

263
00:06:39,856 --> 00:06:41,650
which makes me want to

264
00:06:39,856 --> 00:06:41,650
self-soothe by doing science,

265
00:06:41,691 --> 00:06:44,486
and on and on and on.

266
00:06:44,527 --> 00:06:46,155
So that's been my today.

267
00:06:48,115 --> 00:06:49,783
Hey, how about a massage?

268
00:06:49,825 --> 00:06:51,785
No, the only person who

269
00:06:49,825 --> 00:06:51,785
touches me is my wife.

270
00:06:51,827 --> 00:06:54,454
And even I have to let him

271
00:06:51,827 --> 00:06:54,454
smell my hand first.

272
00:06:58,332 --> 00:07:00,085
Okay, well,

273
00:06:58,332 --> 00:07:00,085
what about Reiki?

274
00:07:00,127 --> 00:07:01,878
It's like massage

275
00:07:00,127 --> 00:07:01,878
but without touching.

276
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,088
Then what is it?

277
00:07:03,130 --> 00:07:05,174
Well, I place my hands

278
00:07:03,130 --> 00:07:05,174
near your body

279
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:07,425
and allow

280
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:07,425
the universal energy field

281
00:07:07,467 --> 00:07:08,885
to manifest

282
00:07:07,467 --> 00:07:08,885
its healing powers.

283
00:07:08,927 --> 00:07:10,344
Okay, I know

284
00:07:10,386 --> 00:07:12,346
it sounds crazy, but it

285
00:07:10,386 --> 00:07:12,346
really works; ask Leonard.

286
00:07:12,388 --> 00:07:14,057
(stammers)

287
00:07:12,388 --> 00:07:14,057
It really does.

288
00:07:12,388 --> 00:07:14,057
Yeah.

289
00:07:14,099 --> 00:07:15,809
(mouthing):

290
00:07:14,099 --> 00:07:15,809
No.

291
00:07:17,727 --> 00:07:20,563
Oh, uh, how about a

292
00:07:17,727 --> 00:07:20,563
sensory deprivation tank?

293
00:07:20,605 --> 00:07:22,732
Oh, that's interesting.

294
00:07:22,774 --> 00:07:24,109
It's supposed to be

295
00:07:22,774 --> 00:07:24,109
very calming.

296
00:07:24,151 --> 00:07:26,278
Floating in a warm pool

297
00:07:24,151 --> 00:07:26,278
of liquid

298
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:28,030
in a dark, soundless space.

299
00:07:28,071 --> 00:07:29,447
Oh, I don't know

300
00:07:28,071 --> 00:07:29,447
how I feel about

301
00:07:29,489 --> 00:07:30,866
being deprived of all my senses.

302
00:07:30,907 --> 00:07:32,075
What are you talking about?

303
00:07:32,117 --> 00:07:33,451
All you ever do is complain

304
00:07:33,493 --> 00:07:35,204
about how things

305
00:07:33,493 --> 00:07:35,204
smell, feel and sound.

306
00:07:35,245 --> 00:07:38,332
Oh, I'm right here.

307
00:07:35,245 --> 00:07:38,332
Why are you shouting?

308
00:07:39,958 --> 00:07:42,377
What do you say?

309
00:07:39,958 --> 00:07:42,377
We could both use a break.

310
00:07:42,418 --> 00:07:44,046
Come on,

311
00:07:42,418 --> 00:07:44,046
I'll do it with you.

312
00:07:44,087 --> 00:07:45,588
Okay, but not

313
00:07:44,087 --> 00:07:45,588
in the same tank.

314
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:47,590
I already shared a uterus

315
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:47,590
with my twin sister.

316
00:07:47,632 --> 00:07:49,176
I don't need to go

317
00:07:47,632 --> 00:07:49,176
through that again.

318
00:07:51,011 --> 00:07:53,555
Are your eyes closed?

319
00:07:51,011 --> 00:07:53,555
Yes. What is it? Show me.

320
00:07:53,596 --> 00:07:55,015
Okay, open them.

321
00:07:56,266 --> 00:07:59,311
You bought me

322
00:07:56,266 --> 00:07:59,311
a scooter?

323
00:07:59,353 --> 00:08:02,314
No, I bought me a scooter!

324
00:08:02,356 --> 00:08:05,317
Then why did you make me

325
00:08:02,356 --> 00:08:05,317
close my eyes?

326
00:08:05,359 --> 00:08:07,194
I wanted to see the expression

327
00:08:05,359 --> 00:08:07,194
on your face

328
00:08:07,236 --> 00:08:08,778
when you saw how happy I was.

329
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:11,156
Wait, one second.

330
00:08:11,198 --> 00:08:13,242
Won't Bernadette be mad

331
00:08:11,198 --> 00:08:13,242
when she finds out?

332
00:08:13,283 --> 00:08:15,369
She's not gonna. I'm keeping it

333
00:08:13,283 --> 00:08:15,369
here at the university.

334
00:08:15,410 --> 00:08:16,870
Ah.

335
00:08:16,912 --> 00:08:18,538
My dad kept a secret

336
00:08:16,912 --> 00:08:18,538
at work, too,

337
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:20,623
but it was his receptionist.

338
00:08:20,665 --> 00:08:23,085
Hey, would you mind

339
00:08:20,665 --> 00:08:23,085
if I ride it sometimes?

340
00:08:23,126 --> 00:08:25,045
Yeah, whenever you want.

341
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:26,046
(engine starts)

342
00:08:26,088 --> 00:08:27,505
(exhales)

343
00:08:26,088 --> 00:08:27,505
Check it out.

344
00:08:27,547 --> 00:08:29,174
(engine revving)

345
00:08:29,216 --> 00:08:30,759
(chuckles) That there, son,

346
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:33,762
is 12 horses

347
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:33,762
of "eye-talian" thunder.

348
00:08:33,803 --> 00:08:35,097
(engine revving)

349
00:08:37,057 --> 00:08:39,893
Have either of you done

350
00:08:37,057 --> 00:08:39,893
sensory deprivation before?

351
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:41,686
No.

352
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:41,686
Never.

353
00:08:41,728 --> 00:08:43,438
Okay, just a heads up.

354
00:08:43,479 --> 00:08:45,481
People have different

355
00:08:43,479 --> 00:08:45,481
experiences in the tanks.

356
00:08:45,523 --> 00:08:47,734
Uh, some people experience

357
00:08:45,523 --> 00:08:47,734
perfect calm.

358
00:08:47,776 --> 00:08:49,361
Some people sleep.

359
00:08:49,403 --> 00:08:50,820
Some people even reported

360
00:08:49,403 --> 00:08:50,820
having visions.

361
00:08:50,862 --> 00:08:53,115
But if at any time

362
00:08:50,862 --> 00:08:53,115
you feel uncomfortable,

363
00:08:53,156 --> 00:08:55,450
just press the panic button

364
00:08:53,156 --> 00:08:55,450
and say, "Bebe."

365
00:08:55,491 --> 00:08:58,287
(laughs) That's a stupid word.

366
00:08:58,328 --> 00:08:59,829
That's my name.

367
00:09:01,581 --> 00:09:04,626
What do we push if

368
00:09:01,581 --> 00:09:04,626
we feel uncomfortable?

369
00:09:04,667 --> 00:09:06,628
All right, are you ready?

370
00:09:06,669 --> 00:09:08,380
I'm not saying

371
00:09:06,669 --> 00:09:08,380
this is why we came,

372
00:09:08,422 --> 00:09:11,007
but can I close

373
00:09:08,422 --> 00:09:11,007
the lid on him?

374
00:09:11,049 --> 00:09:12,259
No.

375
00:09:13,176 --> 00:09:14,719
No.

376
00:09:16,846 --> 00:09:18,014
Shall we?

377
00:09:18,056 --> 00:09:19,515
(stammers) One second.

378
00:09:19,557 --> 00:09:22,144
Is the pH between

379
00:09:19,557 --> 00:09:22,144
7.2 and 7.8?

380
00:09:19,557 --> 00:09:22,144
Yes.

381
00:09:22,185 --> 00:09:24,396
Is the water drained

382
00:09:22,185 --> 00:09:24,396
and replaced after each use?

383
00:09:24,438 --> 00:09:25,397
Yes.

384
00:09:25,439 --> 00:09:27,482
Is the saline level 30%?

385
00:09:25,439 --> 00:09:27,482
Yes.

386
00:09:27,523 --> 00:09:29,151
Does your filtration system

387
00:09:27,523 --> 00:09:29,151
use ultraviolet light

388
00:09:29,192 --> 00:09:31,027
to kill bacteria?

389
00:09:29,192 --> 00:09:31,027
Yes.

390
00:09:31,069 --> 00:09:33,989
I don't need to get in.

391
00:09:31,069 --> 00:09:33,989
I'm relaxed already.

392
00:09:40,662 --> 00:09:42,414
Bebe.

393
00:09:46,126 --> 00:09:47,585
What's wrong?

394
00:09:47,627 --> 00:09:50,005
Nothing. I just wanted

395
00:09:47,627 --> 00:09:50,005
to make sure it worked.

396
00:09:50,046 --> 00:09:51,631
Also, I changed my mind.

397
00:09:51,673 --> 00:09:53,633
It's fun to say your name.

398
00:09:53,675 --> 00:09:55,218
Bebe. Bebe.

399
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:57,804
Bebe. Bebe.

400
00:09:57,846 --> 00:09:59,514
Bebe. Bebe.

401
00:09:59,555 --> 00:10:00,849
Bebe.

402
00:10:00,890 --> 00:10:03,518
BERNADETTE:

403
00:10:00,890 --> 00:10:03,518
Hey, what you got there?

404
00:10:06,562 --> 00:10:08,857
Oh. (stammers)

405
00:10:08,898 --> 00:10:12,402
Just tossing out this old

406
00:10:08,898 --> 00:10:12,402
helmet I don't need.

407
00:10:15,155 --> 00:10:16,781
I thought you were at the park.

408
00:10:16,823 --> 00:10:18,408
We were. The kids

409
00:10:16,823 --> 00:10:18,408
got sleepy.

410
00:10:18,450 --> 00:10:21,036
Great story.

411
00:10:18,450 --> 00:10:21,036
I need to make a phone call.

412
00:10:21,077 --> 00:10:23,205
Howard, why do you

413
00:10:21,077 --> 00:10:23,205
look all guilty?

414
00:10:23,246 --> 00:10:25,748
Like when I catch you deleting

415
00:10:23,246 --> 00:10:25,748
your browser history?

416
00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:27,542
(horn honking)

417
00:10:35,258 --> 00:10:36,843
Never mind.

418
00:10:40,263 --> 00:10:43,183
SHELDON:

419
00:10:40,263 --> 00:10:43,183
Hmm, this is nice.

420
00:10:43,225 --> 00:10:45,852
It's sort of like

421
00:10:43,225 --> 00:10:45,852
floating in space.

422
00:10:45,894 --> 00:10:49,731
But better because

423
00:10:45,894 --> 00:10:49,731
my eyeballs haven't frozen.

424
00:10:49,772 --> 00:10:51,983
Ooh, colors.

425
00:10:49,772 --> 00:10:51,983
(relaxing classical music

426
00:10:49,772 --> 00:10:51,983
playing)

427
00:10:52,025 --> 00:10:53,818
(gasps)

428
00:10:52,025 --> 00:10:53,818
It's infinite iterations

429
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:58,031
of the "Nautilus" section

430
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:58,031
of the Mandelbrot set.

431
00:10:58,073 --> 00:10:59,949
(sighs)

432
00:10:59,991 --> 00:11:02,702
That's some good stuff.

433
00:10:59,991 --> 00:11:02,702
(music stops)

434
00:11:05,705 --> 00:11:09,167
AMY:

435
00:11:05,705 --> 00:11:09,167
Wow, this is really dark.

436
00:11:09,209 --> 00:11:12,879
There's no difference between

437
00:11:09,209 --> 00:11:12,879
my eyes being open or closed.

438
00:11:12,921 --> 00:11:15,048
Open, closed.

439
00:11:15,090 --> 00:11:17,467
Open, clo—

440
00:11:15,090 --> 00:11:17,467
nope, same thing.

441
00:11:19,593 --> 00:11:21,595
Ooh, pretty.

442
00:11:21,637 --> 00:11:25,683
You winning a Nobel Prize would

443
00:11:21,637 --> 00:11:25,683
be an inspiration to all women.

444
00:11:25,725 --> 00:11:29,271
All women, Amy,

445
00:11:25,725 --> 00:11:29,271
and you're blowing it.

446
00:11:29,312 --> 00:11:32,606
I was gonna be a scientist,

447
00:11:29,312 --> 00:11:32,606
but since you lost,

448
00:11:32,648 --> 00:11:35,569
I'm just gonna give

449
00:11:32,648 --> 00:11:35,569
makeup tutorials on YouTube.

450
00:11:38,988 --> 00:11:41,450
(relaxing classical music

451
00:11:38,988 --> 00:11:41,450
playing)

452
00:11:41,491 --> 00:11:44,618
SHELDON:

453
00:11:41,491 --> 00:11:44,618
Look all the infinite

454
00:11:41,491 --> 00:11:44,618
Mandelbrot sets.

455
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:47,581
Here a brot, there a brot,

456
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:47,581
everywhere a Mandelbrot.

457
00:11:51,667 --> 00:11:53,420
Thanks for letting us down.

458
00:11:53,462 --> 00:11:56,131
I'm gonna marry a dope

459
00:11:53,462 --> 00:11:56,131
and have his dopey children.

460
00:11:56,172 --> 00:11:58,258
You're such a disappointment.

461
00:11:56,172 --> 00:11:58,258
I can't do science.

462
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:00,176
Way to not go, girl.

463
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:00,176
Disappointing.

464
00:12:00,218 --> 00:12:03,346
Math is too hard.

465
00:12:00,218 --> 00:12:03,346
I am woman, hear me bake.

466
00:12:03,388 --> 00:12:05,056
Disappointment.

467
00:12:03,388 --> 00:12:05,056
You're letting us down.

468
00:12:05,098 --> 00:12:06,891
You're letting us down.

469
00:12:05,098 --> 00:12:06,891
You're blowing it.

470
00:12:06,933 --> 00:12:08,477
Disappointment.

471
00:12:06,933 --> 00:12:08,477
You're blowing it.

472
00:12:08,518 --> 00:12:10,103
Mm, mm, mm.

473
00:12:12,147 --> 00:12:15,066
Okay, hour's up.

474
00:12:12,147 --> 00:12:15,066
Let's see how they're doing.

475
00:12:16,859 --> 00:12:18,987
Hey, buddy, how you feeling?

476
00:12:19,028 --> 00:12:20,155
(moans):

477
00:12:19,028 --> 00:12:20,155
Aw.

478
00:12:20,196 --> 00:12:22,491
Five more minutes?

479
00:12:25,368 --> 00:12:27,329
Hey, Amy. Relaxed?

480
00:12:27,370 --> 00:12:30,290
I'm a failure! I can't do this!

481
00:12:31,665 --> 00:12:33,251
Can someone close her lid?

482
00:12:33,293 --> 00:12:34,586
She's kind of

483
00:12:33,293 --> 00:12:34,586
harshing my mellow.

484
00:12:39,549 --> 00:12:41,510
That tank was amazing.

485
00:12:41,551 --> 00:12:45,263
It was like Disneyland, but

486
00:12:41,551 --> 00:12:45,263
the rides were in 35 dimensions.

487
00:12:45,305 --> 00:12:47,265
And instead of Mickey,

488
00:12:45,305 --> 00:12:47,265
I had my picture taken

489
00:12:47,307 --> 00:12:49,434
with the concept

490
00:12:47,307 --> 00:12:49,434
that time is an illusion.

491
00:12:51,561 --> 00:12:54,439
That's great.

492
00:12:51,561 --> 00:12:54,439
I'm so happy for you.

493
00:12:54,481 --> 00:12:56,650
Uh, yeah, a little

494
00:12:54,481 --> 00:12:56,650
constructive criticism:

495
00:12:56,690 --> 00:13:00,736
You're saying you're happy, but

496
00:12:56,690 --> 00:13:00,736
you're using your mean voice.

497
00:13:00,778 --> 00:13:02,531
Thanks for pointing that out.

498
00:13:02,572 --> 00:13:04,698
Now you got it.

499
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:07,369
Sheldon, I'm freaking out.

500
00:13:07,410 --> 00:13:09,621
Well, is this still

501
00:13:07,410 --> 00:13:09,621
about the Nobel Prize?

502
00:13:09,663 --> 00:13:11,289
Yes, it's about the Nobel Prize!

503
00:13:11,331 --> 00:13:13,041
And back to the mean voice.

504
00:13:13,082 --> 00:13:16,545
It's just—

505
00:13:13,082 --> 00:13:16,545
it's too much pressure.

506
00:13:16,586 --> 00:13:19,381
You know? It was bad enough

507
00:13:16,586 --> 00:13:19,381
when I was letting us down.

508
00:13:19,422 --> 00:13:22,384
But now, if I don't win, it's

509
00:13:19,422 --> 00:13:22,384
like I'm letting all women down.

510
00:13:22,425 --> 00:13:25,053
Hang on.

511
00:13:22,425 --> 00:13:25,053
What-what are you doing?

512
00:13:25,094 --> 00:13:27,597
I'm googling what to do

513
00:13:25,094 --> 00:13:27,597
when someone's freaking out.

514
00:13:27,639 --> 00:13:29,807
Huh.

515
00:13:29,849 --> 00:13:31,476
Uh, whoa, it says here

516
00:13:31,518 --> 00:13:34,103
that a walk can be calming.

517
00:13:34,145 --> 00:13:36,022
Bye.

518
00:13:41,486 --> 00:13:43,613
Hey.

519
00:13:43,655 --> 00:13:45,114
You still mad?

520
00:13:45,156 --> 00:13:47,741
Are you still a jackass?

521
00:13:47,783 --> 00:13:50,036
Now, now, I asked you first.

522
00:13:50,078 --> 00:13:52,247
I can't believe you were

523
00:13:52,288 --> 00:13:54,165
sneaking around my back

524
00:13:52,288 --> 00:13:54,165
like a child.

525
00:13:54,207 --> 00:13:56,501
(scoffs) I just didn't

526
00:13:54,207 --> 00:13:56,501
want you to worry.

527
00:13:56,543 --> 00:13:58,794
No, you just didn't

528
00:13:56,543 --> 00:13:58,794
want to get caught.

529
00:13:58,836 --> 00:14:01,339
I'm sorry, but you telling me

530
00:13:58,836 --> 00:14:01,339
what I can and can't do

531
00:14:01,381 --> 00:14:02,465
is pretty damn emasculating.

532
00:14:02,507 --> 00:14:04,426
Emasculating?

533
00:14:04,467 --> 00:14:08,555
You were about to ride bitch

534
00:14:04,467 --> 00:14:08,555
on a moped with another man.

535
00:14:09,723 --> 00:14:11,683
It's a scooter.

536
00:14:11,725 --> 00:14:15,186
It can go on some highways.

537
00:14:16,812 --> 00:14:18,189
What if you fell?

538
00:14:18,231 --> 00:14:19,691
What if you got hurt?

539
00:14:19,733 --> 00:14:21,568
I don't want to raise

540
00:14:19,733 --> 00:14:21,568
two small children

541
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:24,529
and one large vegetable.

542
00:14:24,571 --> 00:14:26,698
I'm sorry, but I need to have

543
00:14:24,571 --> 00:14:26,698
something in my life

544
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:29,117
that reminds me I'm still a man.

545
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:29,117
You do.

546
00:14:29,158 --> 00:14:32,454
You have a wife and two children

547
00:14:29,158 --> 00:14:32,454
who need their father.

548
00:14:32,495 --> 00:14:33,955
I know that.

549
00:14:33,996 --> 00:14:36,499
Uh, well, you don't act like it.

550
00:14:36,541 --> 00:14:39,335
Why do you want to ride

551
00:14:36,541 --> 00:14:39,335
that stupid thing anyway?

552
00:14:39,377 --> 00:14:41,630
I don't know.

553
00:14:41,671 --> 00:14:46,217
Maybe I just miss the freedom

554
00:14:41,671 --> 00:14:46,217
I had as a younger man.

555
00:14:46,259 --> 00:14:49,095
What freedom?

556
00:14:46,259 --> 00:14:49,095
You lived with your mother.

557
00:14:50,513 --> 00:14:53,683
You had a curfew.

558
00:14:53,725 --> 00:14:56,102
It wasn't a curfew;

559
00:14:53,725 --> 00:14:56,102
it was just a time of night

560
00:14:56,144 --> 00:14:59,689
where if I got home after that,

561
00:14:56,144 --> 00:14:59,689
she would be mad.

562
00:14:59,731 --> 00:15:01,899
You know what?

563
00:14:59,731 --> 00:15:01,899
I'm done talking about this.

564
00:15:01,941 --> 00:15:04,026
Do whatever you want.

565
00:15:01,941 --> 00:15:04,026
I will!

566
00:15:04,068 --> 00:15:06,904
I just want you to ask yourself

567
00:15:04,068 --> 00:15:06,904
if that tiny, ridiculous scooter

568
00:15:06,946 --> 00:15:09,658
is the hill you want to die on.

569
00:15:11,493 --> 00:15:13,703
(engine revving)

570
00:15:13,745 --> 00:15:17,332
Oh, yeah, this feels good.

571
00:15:17,373 --> 00:15:19,459
Born to ride, buddy.

572
00:15:20,710 --> 00:15:23,004
Yeah, watch out, ladies.

573
00:15:23,045 --> 00:15:24,506
All right, well, wish me luck.

574
00:15:24,547 --> 00:15:26,257
You won't need luck.

575
00:15:26,299 --> 00:15:28,301
Yeah, only condoms.

576
00:15:32,472 --> 00:15:34,390
He sees that car, right?

577
00:15:37,226 --> 00:15:40,855
I tried to console her,

578
00:15:37,226 --> 00:15:40,855
but nothing seemed to work.

579
00:15:40,896 --> 00:15:43,692
Okay, when you say

580
00:15:40,896 --> 00:15:43,692
you consoled her,

581
00:15:43,733 --> 00:15:45,527
what exactly

582
00:15:43,733 --> 00:15:45,527
does that mean?

583
00:15:45,568 --> 00:15:48,196
(sighs)

584
00:15:45,568 --> 00:15:48,196
I took a walk, I came back,

585
00:15:48,237 --> 00:15:50,906
she was still upset,

586
00:15:48,237 --> 00:15:50,906
so I came here.

587
00:15:52,950 --> 00:15:56,287
Well, I don't see

588
00:15:52,950 --> 00:15:56,287
what else you could've done.

589
00:15:56,329 --> 00:16:00,041
You know, I know she's unhappy,

590
00:15:56,329 --> 00:16:00,041
but I don't know how to help.

591
00:16:00,082 --> 00:16:01,209
LEONARD:

592
00:16:00,082 --> 00:16:01,209
Maybe you can't.

593
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:02,711
Sometimes people are upset,

594
00:16:02,752 --> 00:16:05,296
and all you can do

595
00:16:02,752 --> 00:16:05,296
is be there for them.

596
00:16:05,338 --> 00:16:08,466
And while I'm there,

597
00:16:05,338 --> 00:16:08,466
what do I do?

598
00:16:08,508 --> 00:16:10,218
Nothing.

599
00:16:10,259 --> 00:16:14,055
Oh, so like what you're doing

600
00:16:10,259 --> 00:16:14,055
right now to help me.

601
00:16:15,264 --> 00:16:17,600
You're up.

602
00:16:15,264 --> 00:16:17,600
(grunts)

603
00:16:17,642 --> 00:16:19,435
Sheldon, maybe you

604
00:16:17,642 --> 00:16:19,435
don't know what to do

605
00:16:19,477 --> 00:16:22,230
because Amy's always

606
00:16:19,477 --> 00:16:22,230
taking care of you.

607
00:16:22,271 --> 00:16:24,733
Of course.

608
00:16:24,774 --> 00:16:27,443
And by calming down,

609
00:16:24,774 --> 00:16:27,443
I've taken away the one thing

610
00:16:27,485 --> 00:16:30,279
that gives her comfort:

611
00:16:27,485 --> 00:16:30,279
caring for me.

612
00:16:32,365 --> 00:16:34,409
That's what you heard?

613
00:16:34,450 --> 00:16:36,327
Yes.

614
00:16:36,369 --> 00:16:37,912
No, I need to have

615
00:16:37,953 --> 00:16:39,706
an emotional meltdown

616
00:16:37,953 --> 00:16:39,706
so she's forced

617
00:16:39,748 --> 00:16:41,916
to focus on me

618
00:16:39,748 --> 00:16:41,916
and forget about herself.

619
00:16:41,957 --> 00:16:44,753
No. Th-That's not

620
00:16:41,957 --> 00:16:44,753
even close to what—

621
00:16:44,794 --> 00:16:47,213
Uh, you know, actually, that

622
00:16:44,794 --> 00:16:47,213
might be your best move. Yeah.

623
00:16:48,798 --> 00:16:51,760
Amy. Thank goodness

624
00:16:48,798 --> 00:16:51,760
you're home.

625
00:16:51,801 --> 00:16:54,136
I don't know if you can tell,

626
00:16:51,801 --> 00:16:54,136
but I am literally

627
00:16:54,178 --> 00:16:56,264
losing my mind.

628
00:16:54,178 --> 00:16:56,264
You are?

629
00:16:56,305 --> 00:16:59,559
Isn't it obvious? I just used

630
00:16:56,305 --> 00:16:59,559
"literally" figuratively.

631
00:17:00,894 --> 00:17:03,187
Like a crazy person.

632
00:17:03,229 --> 00:17:05,899
What is going on with you?

633
00:17:03,229 --> 00:17:05,899
Are you okay?

634
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:08,484
No, I am not okay, so I suggest

635
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:08,484
you start focusing on me

636
00:17:08,526 --> 00:17:10,027
to the exclusion of

637
00:17:08,526 --> 00:17:10,027
your own feelings.

638
00:17:10,069 --> 00:17:12,530
Sheldon, whatever you're doing,

639
00:17:12,572 --> 00:17:14,323
I-I don't have time

640
00:17:12,572 --> 00:17:14,323
for it right now.

641
00:17:15,950 --> 00:17:17,535
I'm sorry.

642
00:17:15,950 --> 00:17:17,535
I know you're upset,

643
00:17:17,577 --> 00:17:19,537
but I don't know

644
00:17:17,577 --> 00:17:19,537
how to make it better.

645
00:17:19,579 --> 00:17:21,497
I don't know

646
00:17:19,579 --> 00:17:21,497
how you can, either.

647
00:17:22,998 --> 00:17:24,626
I mean, I don't know

648
00:17:22,998 --> 00:17:24,626
if anybody can.

649
00:17:24,667 --> 00:17:26,294
I just—

650
00:17:26,335 --> 00:17:28,922
I feel like I'm letting

651
00:17:26,335 --> 00:17:28,922
everybody down.

652
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:41,601
I'm about to hold you. Would you

653
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:41,601
like to smell my hand first?

654
00:17:45,313 --> 00:17:47,064
I'm fine.

655
00:17:52,695 --> 00:17:54,238
(sighs)

656
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:56,198

Raj said you got $800.

Jerk.

668
00:18:33,486 --> 00:18:36,197
On a positive note, the scooter

669
00:18:33,486 --> 00:18:36,197
helped Bert meet a girl.

670
00:18:36,238 --> 00:18:38,616
Oh, that's nice.

671
00:18:36,238 --> 00:18:38,616
What does she do?

672
00:18:38,658 --> 00:18:41,369
She's an E.R. nurse.

673
00:18:41,410 --> 00:18:43,371
Oh, no.

674
00:18:41,410 --> 00:18:43,371
No.

675
00:18:43,412 --> 00:18:44,956
It was a real meet-cute.

676
00:18:44,998 --> 00:18:46,833
She popped his arm

677
00:18:44,998 --> 00:18:46,833
back in the socket,

678
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:49,878
and when he came to,

679
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:49,878
they exchanged phone numbers.

680
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:51,337
Aw.

681
00:18:53,756 --> 00:18:54,883
(knock on door)

682
00:18:54,924 --> 00:18:55,884
Ms. Davis?

683
00:18:55,925 --> 00:18:58,052
Dr. Fowler, how can I help you?

684
00:18:58,093 --> 00:19:01,639
You were right about this Nobel

685
00:18:58,093 --> 00:19:01,639
Prize being bigger than I am,

686
00:19:01,681 --> 00:19:03,224
and you were right

687
00:19:03,265 --> 00:19:05,309
that, like it or not,

688
00:19:03,265 --> 00:19:05,309
I am a role model.

689
00:19:05,351 --> 00:19:07,979
But you are wrong

690
00:19:05,351 --> 00:19:07,979
to keep me on the sidelines.

691
00:19:08,021 --> 00:19:11,649
I am smart, I'm capable,

692
00:19:08,021 --> 00:19:11,649
and I can make a difference.

693
00:19:11,691 --> 00:19:15,110
Well said.

694
00:19:11,691 --> 00:19:15,110
You make a strong case.

695
00:19:15,152 --> 00:19:16,863
Damn right,

696
00:19:15,152 --> 00:19:16,863
'cause I'm a strong woman

697
00:19:16,905 --> 00:19:18,948
wearing

698
00:19:16,905 --> 00:19:18,948
a strong man's deodorant!

699
00:19:21,034 --> 00:19:23,077
Well, how about have a seat?

700
00:19:23,118 --> 00:19:25,287
Maybe you'd like

701
00:19:23,118 --> 00:19:25,287
a glass of water?

702
00:19:25,329 --> 00:19:28,082
You have anything with

703
00:19:25,329 --> 00:19:28,082
a little more kick?

704
00:19:28,123 --> 00:19:31,126
Seriously, Dr. Fowler,

705
00:19:28,123 --> 00:19:31,126
this is human resources.

706
00:19:31,168 --> 00:19:32,754
You're right.

707
00:19:32,795 --> 00:19:34,589
I-I don't know

708
00:19:32,795 --> 00:19:34,589
what I was thinking.

709
00:19:38,426 --> 00:19:41,054
You want ice,

710
00:19:38,426 --> 00:19:41,054
you're out of luck.
