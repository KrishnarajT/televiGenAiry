1
00:00:08,457 --> 00:00:10,626
Oh, this is amazing.

2
00:00:10,667 --> 00:00:12,920
I wish I had a playhouse

3
00:00:10,667 --> 00:00:12,920
like this when I was a kid.

4
00:00:12,962 --> 00:00:14,546
Really? You never had

5
00:00:12,962 --> 00:00:14,546
a playhouse?

6
00:00:14,588 --> 00:00:17,299
No. I mean, my dad did buy

7
00:00:14,588 --> 00:00:17,299
the house next door

8
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:19,885
for us to play in.

9
00:00:19,927 --> 00:00:22,638
I'm gonna hook up the garden

10
00:00:19,927 --> 00:00:22,638
hose, so it has running water.

11
00:00:22,679 --> 00:00:23,931
Why does it need

12
00:00:22,679 --> 00:00:23,931
running water?

13
00:00:23,973 --> 00:00:25,933
Same reason

14
00:00:23,973 --> 00:00:25,933
it's got electricity:

15
00:00:25,975 --> 00:00:28,852
Bernadette and I both work,

16
00:00:25,975 --> 00:00:28,852
and we're overcompensating.

17
00:00:30,312 --> 00:00:34,274
This reminds me of a traditional

18
00:00:30,312 --> 00:00:34,274
Amish barn raising.

19
00:00:34,316 --> 00:00:36,359
With everyone pitching in.

20
00:00:36,401 --> 00:00:38,737
How exactly are you pitching in?

21
00:00:38,779 --> 00:00:40,906
I don't hear anyone else

22
00:00:38,779 --> 00:00:40,906
giving facts

23
00:00:40,948 --> 00:00:42,866
about traditional

24
00:00:40,948 --> 00:00:42,866
Amish barn raising.

25
00:00:44,367 --> 00:00:46,870
The rest of us are pitching in

26
00:00:44,367 --> 00:00:46,870
with hammers and nails.

27
00:00:46,912 --> 00:00:50,164
Well, facts are my nails,

28
00:00:46,912 --> 00:00:50,164
and my voice is the hammer

29
00:00:50,206 --> 00:00:53,209
which pounds them

30
00:00:50,206 --> 00:00:53,209
through the wood of your skull.

31
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:56,170
Well, that is how it feels.

32
00:00:57,339 --> 00:00:58,882
Hey, uh, can you

33
00:00:57,339 --> 00:00:58,882
pass me that drill?

34
00:00:58,924 --> 00:01:00,884
Yeah, fun fact

35
00:00:58,924 --> 00:01:00,884
about Amish barn raising—

36
00:01:00,926 --> 00:01:02,719
they don't use any power tools.

37
00:01:02,761 --> 00:01:05,180
Amy, make him stop.

38
00:01:02,761 --> 00:01:05,180
No.

39
00:01:05,221 --> 00:01:08,058
If he tires himself out now,

40
00:01:05,221 --> 00:01:08,058
he'll sleep better tonight.

41
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:10,811
BERNADETTE: Hey, Howie,

42
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:10,811
can you give me a hand?

43
00:01:10,853 --> 00:01:12,104
I need to get some work done,

44
00:01:12,146 --> 00:01:13,480
and the kids are climbing

45
00:01:12,146 --> 00:01:13,480
all over me.

46
00:01:13,522 --> 00:01:15,357
You know what?

47
00:01:13,522 --> 00:01:15,357
I'll watch them.

48
00:01:15,398 --> 00:01:17,484
You sure?

49
00:01:15,398 --> 00:01:17,484
But I was just

50
00:01:15,398 --> 00:01:17,484
about to tell everyone

51
00:01:17,526 --> 00:01:18,986
why they're called

52
00:01:17,526 --> 00:01:18,986
Pennsylvania Dutch

53
00:01:19,028 --> 00:01:20,821
when they really hail

54
00:01:19,028 --> 00:01:20,821
from Germany.

55
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:22,906
Yep.

56
00:01:22,948 --> 00:01:24,867
Thanks.

57
00:01:24,908 --> 00:01:28,495
So, what do you think?

58
00:01:24,908 --> 00:01:28,495
Pretty cool, huh?

59
00:01:28,537 --> 00:01:29,913
And when our kids outgrow it,

60
00:01:29,955 --> 00:01:31,832
we can Airbnb it

61
00:01:29,955 --> 00:01:31,832
to other people's babies.

62
00:01:33,583 --> 00:01:35,209
Funny.

63
00:01:35,251 --> 00:01:36,503
You all right?

64
00:01:36,545 --> 00:01:38,338
Sorry, I haven't had

65
00:01:36,545 --> 00:01:38,338
a second to myself.

66
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:40,590
So let me just go back

67
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:40,590
inside, finish my report,

68
00:01:40,632 --> 00:01:43,135
brush my teeth, change

69
00:01:40,632 --> 00:01:43,135
out of my pajamas,

70
00:01:40,632 --> 00:01:43,135
make a sandwich,

71
00:01:43,177 --> 00:01:45,804
and then I'll come out here

72
00:01:43,177 --> 00:01:45,804
and laugh at your joke.

73
00:01:45,846 --> 00:01:48,974
Ooh. As long as you're

74
00:01:45,846 --> 00:01:48,974
making sandwiches...

75
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:53,187
You can laugh

76
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:53,187
at that one later, too.

77
00:01:54,521 --> 00:01:57,315
All right, I've kept you

78
00:01:54,521 --> 00:01:57,315
in suspense long enough.

79
00:01:57,357 --> 00:01:59,651
"Dutch" is a bastardization

80
00:01:57,357 --> 00:01:59,651
of the word "Deutsch,"

81
00:01:59,693 --> 00:02:01,277
meaning German.

82
00:02:01,319 --> 00:02:04,614
What's German for "annoying"?

83
00:02:04,656 --> 00:02:06,742
Nervig. Why do you ask?

President Siebert,

100
00:02:32,559 --> 00:02:35,687
you wanted to see me?

101
00:02:35,729 --> 00:02:37,856
Hey. There's my guy!

102
00:02:38,815 --> 00:02:40,442
You sound like my wife

103
00:02:40,483 --> 00:02:43,319
just before she asked me

104
00:02:40,483 --> 00:02:43,319
to go to Coachella.

105
00:02:43,361 --> 00:02:46,198
No, this is gonna be

106
00:02:43,361 --> 00:02:46,198
way more fun than Coachella.

107
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:49,451
More fun than heatstroke?

108
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:49,451
Good luck.

109
00:02:49,492 --> 00:02:52,204
So, there are some funds left

110
00:02:52,246 --> 00:02:53,997
in the general

111
00:02:52,246 --> 00:02:53,997
administrative grant,

112
00:02:54,039 --> 00:02:57,042
and I need somebody to decide

113
00:02:54,039 --> 00:02:57,042
how we should disburse them.

114
00:02:57,084 --> 00:02:58,252
Really?

115
00:02:58,292 --> 00:03:00,294
W-Wow, what an honor.

116
00:02:58,292 --> 00:03:00,294
Thank you.

117
00:03:00,336 --> 00:03:02,714
So how do I decide

118
00:03:00,336 --> 00:03:02,714
who gets the money?

119
00:03:02,756 --> 00:03:04,466
How do you decide anything?

120
00:03:04,507 --> 00:03:08,178
Think about it with your brain,

121
00:03:04,507 --> 00:03:08,178
and then say it with your mouth.

122
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:10,555
Yeah, right, sure.

123
00:03:10,597 --> 00:03:12,432
Uh, so, after I decide,

124
00:03:12,474 --> 00:03:14,810
do I then submit it to you

125
00:03:12,474 --> 00:03:14,810
for approval, or...?

126
00:03:14,851 --> 00:03:16,310
No. You decide,

127
00:03:14,851 --> 00:03:16,310
you approve,

128
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:18,730
and then you pride yourself

129
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:18,730
on a job well done.

130
00:03:18,772 --> 00:03:20,190
That's a lot of responsibility.

131
00:03:20,232 --> 00:03:22,276
Well, if I didn't think

132
00:03:20,232 --> 00:03:22,276
you were up to the task,

133
00:03:22,316 --> 00:03:24,318
you wouldn't have been fifth

134
00:03:22,316 --> 00:03:24,318
on my list.

135
00:03:26,404 --> 00:03:29,199
Thank you.

136
00:03:26,404 --> 00:03:29,199
I-I'll get started right away.

137
00:03:29,241 --> 00:03:31,243
And I look forward

138
00:03:29,241 --> 00:03:31,243
to hearing nothing about it.

139
00:03:31,285 --> 00:03:33,745
I will keep you posted.

140
00:03:36,414 --> 00:03:37,749
Hey, thank you guys again

141
00:03:37,791 --> 00:03:39,918
for helping out

142
00:03:37,791 --> 00:03:39,918
yesterday.

143
00:03:37,791 --> 00:03:39,918
No problem.

144
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,837
That was really fun.

145
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,837
It was fun.

146
00:03:41,878 --> 00:03:43,630
But I am sore.

147
00:03:43,672 --> 00:03:44,881
You didn't lift a finger.

148
00:03:44,923 --> 00:03:46,967
No, but I narrated

149
00:03:44,923 --> 00:03:46,967
the entire event,

150
00:03:47,009 --> 00:03:49,970
and I am paying for it today.

151
00:03:50,012 --> 00:03:52,430
Gentlemen.

152
00:03:50,012 --> 00:03:52,430
Hey.

153
00:03:50,012 --> 00:03:52,430
Hi.

154
00:03:52,472 --> 00:03:53,932
Leonard, do I detect

155
00:03:53,974 --> 00:03:55,600
a little swagger in your step?

156
00:03:55,642 --> 00:03:56,852
Mm, possibly.

157
00:03:56,893 --> 00:03:58,312
Well, stop.

158
00:03:56,893 --> 00:03:58,312
It doesn't suit you.

159
00:03:59,188 --> 00:04:01,315
What's going on?

160
00:03:59,188 --> 00:04:01,315
Well,

161
00:04:01,356 --> 00:04:03,942
Siebert put me in charge

162
00:04:01,356 --> 00:04:03,942
of handing out the last bit

163
00:04:03,984 --> 00:04:06,153
of the administrative funds,

164
00:04:03,984 --> 00:04:06,153
and I have sole discretion.

165
00:04:06,195 --> 00:04:09,656
Ooh! Looks like

166
00:04:06,195 --> 00:04:09,656
Christmas came early.

167
00:04:09,698 --> 00:04:11,574
First thing on my list

168
00:04:09,698 --> 00:04:11,574
is a golden umbrella,

169
00:04:11,616 --> 00:04:13,827
'cause Leonard's

170
00:04:11,616 --> 00:04:13,827
gonna make it rain!

171
00:04:13,869 --> 00:04:17,289
Uh, hold on, I'm not

172
00:04:13,869 --> 00:04:17,289
just gonna hand out money.

173
00:04:17,331 --> 00:04:19,457
There's a procedure

174
00:04:17,331 --> 00:04:19,457
you need to follow.

175
00:04:19,499 --> 00:04:20,834
I believe he's referring

176
00:04:20,876 --> 00:04:22,752
to the traditional

177
00:04:20,876 --> 00:04:22,752
"kissing of the buttocks."

178
00:04:22,794 --> 00:04:24,171
Should we form a line,

179
00:04:24,213 --> 00:04:26,673
or just do it like

180
00:04:24,213 --> 00:04:26,673
we're bobbing for apples?

181
00:04:26,715 --> 00:04:28,050
LEONARD:

182
00:04:26,715 --> 00:04:28,050
Cute,

183
00:04:28,091 --> 00:04:29,968
but President Siebert

184
00:04:28,091 --> 00:04:29,968
trusted me with this,

185
00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:31,345
and I'm taking it seriously.

186
00:04:31,386 --> 00:04:32,971
If you have a

187
00:04:31,386 --> 00:04:32,971
legitimate request,

188
00:04:33,013 --> 00:04:34,681
you can submit it

189
00:04:33,013 --> 00:04:34,681
to me in writing,

190
00:04:34,723 --> 00:04:36,391
and I'll evaluate it

191
00:04:34,723 --> 00:04:36,391
based on its merits.

192
00:04:36,432 --> 00:04:39,435
Sure, sure. Is "Jet Ski"

193
00:04:36,432 --> 00:04:39,435
one word or two?

194
00:04:39,477 --> 00:04:42,231
Hofstadter!

195
00:04:42,272 --> 00:04:45,359
Heard Siebert put you in charge

196
00:04:42,272 --> 00:04:45,359
of the administrative fund.

197
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:47,777
Can't think

198
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:47,777
of a better guy for the job.

199
00:04:47,819 --> 00:04:49,612
I think he's done this before.

200
00:04:49,654 --> 00:04:52,532
Leonard,

201
00:04:49,654 --> 00:04:52,532
I know you and I have a...

202
00:04:52,574 --> 00:04:55,952
oh, troubled history, but I hope

203
00:04:52,574 --> 00:04:55,952
that when I make my request

204
00:04:55,994 --> 00:04:57,871
you'll give me a fair shot.

205
00:04:57,913 --> 00:04:59,331
Of course.

206
00:04:59,373 --> 00:05:01,708
See? That's why I like

207
00:04:59,373 --> 00:05:01,708
about this guy: integrity.

208
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:03,043
Bring it in!

209
00:05:04,961 --> 00:05:07,381
I just put something

210
00:05:04,961 --> 00:05:07,381
in your pocket.

211
00:05:07,422 --> 00:05:10,759
It's good at all

212
00:05:07,422 --> 00:05:10,759
El Pollo Locos.

213
00:05:14,637 --> 00:05:16,390
(Neil crying)

214
00:05:16,431 --> 00:05:20,394
WOLOWITZ: Halley, leave your

215
00:05:16,431 --> 00:05:20,394
brother's dirty diaper alone.

216
00:05:20,435 --> 00:05:22,812
Put that down.

217
00:05:20,435 --> 00:05:22,812
That is not a hat.

218
00:05:22,854 --> 00:05:25,982
That is not

219
00:05:22,854 --> 00:05:25,982
a hat! Oh!

220
00:05:26,024 --> 00:05:27,859
(crying continues)

221
00:05:27,901 --> 00:05:30,486
Okay. Everybody

222
00:05:27,901 --> 00:05:30,486
in the sink.

223
00:05:27,901 --> 00:05:30,486
Oh.

224
00:05:32,281 --> 00:05:33,489
Bad news, Howie.

225
00:05:33,531 --> 00:05:36,118
I'm gonna be stuck at work

226
00:05:33,531 --> 00:05:36,118
for a while.

227
00:05:39,454 --> 00:05:41,831
Oh, that's terrible.

228
00:05:39,454 --> 00:05:41,831
Hang in there.

229
00:05:41,873 --> 00:05:44,667
I'll be home as soon as I can.

230
00:05:46,628 --> 00:05:48,755
(sighs):

231
00:05:46,628 --> 00:05:48,755
Ah...

232
00:05:49,672 --> 00:05:52,634
He deserves better.

233
00:05:53,802 --> 00:05:55,929
No, I'm not going

234
00:05:53,802 --> 00:05:55,929
to reconsider.

235
00:05:55,971 --> 00:05:58,348
Your request was denied.

236
00:05:58,390 --> 00:06:00,309
I don't care

237
00:05:58,390 --> 00:06:00,309
if it helps you think;

238
00:06:00,350 --> 00:06:03,312
you don't need a koi pond

239
00:06:00,350 --> 00:06:03,312
in your office.

240
00:06:04,478 --> 00:06:06,022
Well, you should

241
00:06:04,478 --> 00:06:06,022
have thought about that

242
00:06:06,064 --> 00:06:08,275
before you bought the koi!

243
00:06:08,317 --> 00:06:09,818
Wow. That was

244
00:06:08,317 --> 00:06:09,818
a little rough.

245
00:06:09,859 --> 00:06:11,527
Well, I have to be.

246
00:06:11,569 --> 00:06:14,030
Everyone assumes I'm just gonna

247
00:06:11,569 --> 00:06:14,030
give them whatever they want.

248
00:06:14,072 --> 00:06:17,909
Hmm. But you're not, are you?

249
00:06:17,951 --> 00:06:19,244
No, I'm not.

250
00:06:19,286 --> 00:06:21,204
I mean, look at this.

251
00:06:21,246 --> 00:06:24,333
An espresso machine?

252
00:06:21,246 --> 00:06:24,333
I don't think so. Denied!

253
00:06:25,499 --> 00:06:28,295
Wow, I really like

254
00:06:25,499 --> 00:06:28,295
this side of you.

255
00:06:28,337 --> 00:06:29,338
Really?

256
00:06:29,379 --> 00:06:32,215
Yeah, just so decisive.

257
00:06:32,257 --> 00:06:34,259
Well, check this out.

258
00:06:34,301 --> 00:06:36,345
A standing desk. Denied!

259
00:06:36,386 --> 00:06:37,929
Oh!

260
00:06:42,142 --> 00:06:44,560
If you want to stand,

261
00:06:42,142 --> 00:06:44,560
do it on your own time,

262
00:06:42,142 --> 00:06:44,560
'cause I'm the boss.

263
00:06:44,602 --> 00:06:46,396
Yeah, you are.

264
00:06:47,314 --> 00:06:49,065
Hello.

265
00:06:47,314 --> 00:06:49,065
Hey.

266
00:06:47,314 --> 00:06:49,065
Hey.

267
00:06:49,107 --> 00:06:51,609
Leonard, I just wanted

268
00:06:49,107 --> 00:06:51,609
to congratulate you on how well

269
00:06:51,651 --> 00:06:53,527
you are managing

270
00:06:51,651 --> 00:06:53,527
this grant money.

271
00:06:51,651 --> 00:06:53,527
What do you want?

272
00:06:53,569 --> 00:06:56,572
Nothing. I just came by

273
00:06:53,569 --> 00:06:56,572
to pay you a compliment.

274
00:06:56,614 --> 00:06:57,866
Nice try.

275
00:06:56,614 --> 00:06:57,866
The answer's no.

276
00:06:57,907 --> 00:07:00,952
To what? I'm not

277
00:06:57,907 --> 00:07:00,952
asking you for anything.

278
00:07:00,994 --> 00:07:03,372
All I need for my job

279
00:07:00,994 --> 00:07:03,372
is right here. Hmm?

280
00:07:03,413 --> 00:07:05,874
This is my office.

281
00:07:03,413 --> 00:07:05,874
Which makes for a great commute.

282
00:07:05,915 --> 00:07:07,709
Home, work, home.

283
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:10,462
I'm still working—

284
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:10,462
I'm just working from home.

285
00:07:10,504 --> 00:07:12,881
You know, if it's that easy,

286
00:07:10,504 --> 00:07:12,881
then why does Leonard

287
00:07:12,922 --> 00:07:14,716
have to drive you

288
00:07:12,922 --> 00:07:14,716
to work every day?

289
00:07:14,757 --> 00:07:17,344
Because I like the frozen yogurt

290
00:07:14,757 --> 00:07:17,344
machine in the cafeteria.

291
00:07:17,386 --> 00:07:20,055
Ooh, I suppose I could use

292
00:07:17,386 --> 00:07:20,055
a frozen yogurt machine...

293
00:07:20,096 --> 00:07:22,224
Denied!

294
00:07:24,767 --> 00:07:28,021
Oh, you should have seen him—

295
00:07:24,767 --> 00:07:28,021
denying things left and right.

296
00:07:28,063 --> 00:07:30,482
It was so sexy.

297
00:07:31,816 --> 00:07:35,070
'Course, I made a request

298
00:07:31,816 --> 00:07:35,070
he did not deny.

299
00:07:36,029 --> 00:07:37,406
Uh-huh.

300
00:07:37,447 --> 00:07:39,199
Are you listening to me?

301
00:07:39,241 --> 00:07:41,535
Yeah, sure.

302
00:07:39,241 --> 00:07:41,535
You slept with your husband.

303
00:07:43,119 --> 00:07:45,288
What is going

304
00:07:43,119 --> 00:07:45,288
on with you?

305
00:07:45,330 --> 00:07:46,998
It's not a big thing.

306
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:50,126
Have you ever told Leonard

307
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:50,126
a little white lie?

308
00:07:50,168 --> 00:07:52,003
Mm. Well, he

309
00:07:50,168 --> 00:07:52,003
thinks I've seen

310
00:07:52,045 --> 00:07:54,297
every one of the

311
00:07:52,045 --> 00:07:54,297
Star Wars movies,

312
00:07:54,339 --> 00:07:58,134
but I've really only seen

313
00:07:54,339 --> 00:07:58,134
the one with the gold robot.

314
00:08:01,221 --> 00:08:03,932
That could be any of them.

315
00:08:01,221 --> 00:08:03,932
Exactly.

316
00:08:05,725 --> 00:08:07,810
I've been telling Howie

317
00:08:05,725 --> 00:08:07,810
that I've had to work late

318
00:08:07,852 --> 00:08:09,354
the past couple nights,

319
00:08:07,852 --> 00:08:09,354
but really,

320
00:08:09,396 --> 00:08:12,274
I've just been hiding out

321
00:08:09,396 --> 00:08:12,274
in Howie's playhouse.

322
00:08:12,315 --> 00:08:13,983
Does that make me awful?

323
00:08:14,025 --> 00:08:15,235
Awful? No.

324
00:08:15,277 --> 00:08:17,904
Uh, strange? Yes.

325
00:08:17,946 --> 00:08:20,532
Sad? A little, yes.

326
00:08:20,574 --> 00:08:23,577
It's just that work's

327
00:08:20,574 --> 00:08:23,577
been crazy, and the minute

328
00:08:20,574 --> 00:08:23,577
I get home, I have two kids

329
00:08:23,618 --> 00:08:25,579
hanging on me,

330
00:08:23,618 --> 00:08:25,579
and sometimes I don't want

331
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:28,123
babies pulling my hair

332
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:28,123
and pinching my belly fat.

333
00:08:28,164 --> 00:08:31,334
That'd be a good slogan

334
00:08:28,164 --> 00:08:31,334
for a condom company.

335
00:08:33,545 --> 00:08:36,172
I love my kids,

336
00:08:33,545 --> 00:08:36,172
but that hour to myself

337
00:08:36,214 --> 00:08:38,091
just makes me feel human again.

338
00:08:38,133 --> 00:08:41,636
So, you go home

339
00:08:38,133 --> 00:08:41,636
and sit alone in a toy house

340
00:08:41,677 --> 00:08:43,263
in the backyard?

341
00:08:44,514 --> 00:08:46,808
Yeah!

342
00:08:49,018 --> 00:08:52,688
Oh, Dr. Hofstadter,

343
00:08:49,018 --> 00:08:52,688
did you have a chance

344
00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:54,316
to look over my proposal?

345
00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:54,316
I did,

346
00:08:54,357 --> 00:08:56,151
and your research

347
00:08:54,357 --> 00:08:56,151
is fascinating.

348
00:08:56,192 --> 00:08:58,487
I had no idea that crows

349
00:08:56,192 --> 00:08:58,487
were that smart.

350
00:08:58,528 --> 00:08:59,946
Do they really hold grudges?

351
00:08:59,988 --> 00:09:01,781
They do. One

352
00:08:59,988 --> 00:09:01,781
of them escaped

353
00:09:01,823 --> 00:09:03,908
from my behavioral

354
00:09:01,823 --> 00:09:03,908
study a year ago.

355
00:09:03,950 --> 00:09:08,121
I can't prove it's him,

356
00:09:03,950 --> 00:09:08,121
but something craps

357
00:09:03,950 --> 00:09:08,121
on my car every day.

358
00:09:08,163 --> 00:09:11,541
Well, l-look,

359
00:09:08,163 --> 00:09:11,541
I only have enough money

360
00:09:11,583 --> 00:09:13,168
to fund one request,

361
00:09:11,583 --> 00:09:13,168
but your project

362
00:09:13,209 --> 00:09:14,877
is definitely

363
00:09:13,209 --> 00:09:14,877
in the running.

364
00:09:14,919 --> 00:09:18,089
Okay, but, uh, when do you think

365
00:09:14,919 --> 00:09:18,089
you might make a decision?

366
00:09:18,131 --> 00:09:19,966
Because I have

367
00:09:18,131 --> 00:09:19,966
to upgrade their cages

368
00:09:20,008 --> 00:09:22,511
before they learn

369
00:09:20,008 --> 00:09:22,511
how to open the locks.

370
00:09:22,552 --> 00:09:25,054
When I came in to my lab

371
00:09:22,552 --> 00:09:25,054
this morning,

372
00:09:25,096 --> 00:09:27,182
they suddenly got silent.

373
00:09:28,308 --> 00:09:31,060
I think they're

374
00:09:28,308 --> 00:09:31,060
planning something.

375
00:09:32,521 --> 00:09:35,190
Um, soon. I've narrowed it

376
00:09:32,521 --> 00:09:35,190
down to three projects.

377
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:36,732
Ooh, is mine one

378
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:36,732
of them?

379
00:09:36,774 --> 00:09:37,984
Actually, yeah.

380
00:09:38,026 --> 00:09:39,319
The software in

381
00:09:38,026 --> 00:09:39,319
the telescope room

382
00:09:39,361 --> 00:09:40,654
hasn't been

383
00:09:39,361 --> 00:09:40,654
upgraded in years,

384
00:09:40,695 --> 00:09:42,697
and it seems like

385
00:09:40,695 --> 00:09:42,697
it might be time.

386
00:09:42,738 --> 00:09:44,699
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

387
00:09:42,738 --> 00:09:44,699
(chuckles)

388
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:46,909
So you're just gonna give

389
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:46,909
the money to your friend?

390
00:09:46,951 --> 00:09:48,203
I smell a rat.

391
00:09:48,244 --> 00:09:49,204
I work with rats, too.

392
00:09:49,245 --> 00:09:50,830
That might be me.

393
00:09:52,081 --> 00:09:54,209
I'm not just giving it

394
00:09:52,081 --> 00:09:54,209
to my friend, Barry.

395
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:56,085
Your proposal is

396
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:56,085
also in the mix.

397
00:09:56,127 --> 00:09:57,837
Wait, so those

398
00:09:56,127 --> 00:09:57,837
are the three?

399
00:09:57,879 --> 00:09:59,506
You're not

400
00:09:57,879 --> 00:09:59,506
even considering mine?

401
00:09:59,548 --> 00:10:01,841
Why, because they're PhDs

402
00:09:59,548 --> 00:10:01,841
and I'm just an engineer?

403
00:10:01,883 --> 00:10:04,219
No, because they wrote

404
00:10:01,883 --> 00:10:04,219
detailed proposals,

405
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:06,888
and you sent a YouTube clip

406
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:06,888
of the guy from Jerry Maguire

407
00:10:06,929 --> 00:10:09,349
saying, "Show me

408
00:10:06,929 --> 00:10:09,349
the money!"

409
00:10:10,642 --> 00:10:11,726
KRIPKE:

410
00:10:10,642 --> 00:10:11,726
All right, Hofstadter,

411
00:10:11,767 --> 00:10:12,810
what's it gonna be?

412
00:10:12,852 --> 00:10:14,145
Which project

413
00:10:12,852 --> 00:10:14,145
are you gonna pick?

414
00:10:14,187 --> 00:10:15,271
Yeah, come on, Leonard.

415
00:10:15,313 --> 00:10:16,814
Tell us now.

416
00:10:15,313 --> 00:10:16,814
LEE: But, remember,

417
00:10:16,856 --> 00:10:20,694
crows aren't the only ones

418
00:10:16,856 --> 00:10:20,694
who can hold a grudge.

419
00:10:20,735 --> 00:10:24,739
Look, all three of your

420
00:10:20,735 --> 00:10:24,739
proposals have a lot of merit.

421
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:26,949
I just want to make sure

422
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:26,949
I'm making the right decision.

423
00:10:26,991 --> 00:10:28,326
I can tell you're stressed.

424
00:10:28,368 --> 00:10:30,745
If it helps,

425
00:10:28,368 --> 00:10:30,745
I withdraw my proposal.

426
00:10:30,786 --> 00:10:31,746
It doesn't help.

427
00:10:31,787 --> 00:10:32,706
Fine. Then I'm back in the mix.

428
00:10:32,747 --> 00:10:34,749
Show me the money!

429
00:10:36,543 --> 00:10:37,919
Okay, I-I just—

430
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:40,463
I need everyone

431
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:40,463
to back off.

432
00:10:40,505 --> 00:10:43,383
I'm in charge here, and I'll

433
00:10:40,505 --> 00:10:43,383
decide when I'm ready to decide.

434
00:10:43,425 --> 00:10:45,260
When will that be?

435
00:10:43,425 --> 00:10:45,260
(groans)

436
00:10:45,301 --> 00:10:46,761
A day, a week.

437
00:10:45,301 --> 00:10:46,761
I don't know!

438
00:10:46,802 --> 00:10:49,097
Where are you going?

439
00:10:46,802 --> 00:10:49,097
I don't know that either!

440
00:10:56,104 --> 00:10:57,731
Ooh.

441
00:10:57,772 --> 00:11:00,858
Someone's

442
00:10:57,772 --> 00:11:00,858
making decisions.

443
00:11:02,110 --> 00:11:03,612
I'm reviewing these proposals.

444
00:11:03,653 --> 00:11:05,655
Yeah. 'Cause you're

445
00:11:03,653 --> 00:11:05,655
the boss man,

446
00:11:05,697 --> 00:11:06,864
telling people what's what.

447
00:11:06,906 --> 00:11:09,284
I like it.

448
00:11:09,325 --> 00:11:10,868
(whining):

449
00:11:09,325 --> 00:11:10,868
It's just so hard!

450
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:13,288
All-all three of these

451
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:13,288
proposals have merit.

452
00:11:13,329 --> 00:11:14,748
How do I choose?

453
00:11:14,789 --> 00:11:18,084
Well, not with that voice.

454
00:11:18,126 --> 00:11:21,170
There has got to be

455
00:11:18,126 --> 00:11:21,170
a right decision

456
00:11:21,212 --> 00:11:22,422
based on empirical evidence.

457
00:11:22,464 --> 00:11:24,466
Look, I made pros

458
00:11:22,464 --> 00:11:24,466
and cons lists,

459
00:11:24,507 --> 00:11:26,718
and then I came up with

460
00:11:24,507 --> 00:11:26,718
three different scoring systems

461
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:28,219
to determine

462
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:28,219
the best project.

463
00:11:28,261 --> 00:11:30,555
I just don't know

464
00:11:28,261 --> 00:11:30,555
what scoring system to use.

465
00:11:30,597 --> 00:11:32,599
So I'm working on

466
00:11:30,597 --> 00:11:32,599
a meta-scoring system

467
00:11:32,641 --> 00:11:33,807
to score the scoring systems,

468
00:11:33,849 --> 00:11:35,101
but the math is

469
00:11:33,849 --> 00:11:35,101
really complicated.

470
00:11:35,143 --> 00:11:36,352
You want me

471
00:11:35,143 --> 00:11:36,352
to walk you through it?

472
00:11:38,605 --> 00:11:42,275
Cheers.

473
00:11:38,605 --> 00:11:42,275
Cheers.

474
00:11:44,068 --> 00:11:46,529
(sighs)

475
00:11:46,571 --> 00:11:48,490
Turn that off.

476
00:11:46,571 --> 00:11:48,490
Are you trying to get us caught?

477
00:11:48,531 --> 00:11:49,616
Oh.

478
00:11:52,118 --> 00:11:55,789
So, I've narrowed it down

479
00:11:52,118 --> 00:11:55,789
to three worthwhile projects,

480
00:11:55,829 --> 00:11:57,915
but I only have the money

481
00:11:55,829 --> 00:11:57,915
to fund one of them.

482
00:11:57,957 --> 00:12:00,335
Lucky for you,

483
00:11:57,957 --> 00:12:00,335
I have a solution.

484
00:12:00,376 --> 00:12:03,087
I can't wait.

485
00:12:03,129 --> 00:12:05,881
You free up more money

486
00:12:03,129 --> 00:12:05,881
and I fund all of them.

487
00:12:05,923 --> 00:12:08,009
Mm, no.

488
00:12:08,050 --> 00:12:11,554
Or— hear me out—

489
00:12:11,596 --> 00:12:13,556
yes.

490
00:12:14,848 --> 00:12:16,601
That way, e-everybody's happy.

491
00:12:16,643 --> 00:12:17,519
You can't make everybody happy.

492
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:19,020
I think I can.

493
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:19,020
You can't.

494
00:12:19,061 --> 00:12:21,439
Well, actually...

495
00:12:19,061 --> 00:12:21,439
You're making me unhappy.

496
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:24,108
Okay, what would you do?

497
00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:26,569
I'd find some sap

498
00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:26,569
and put him in charge

499
00:12:26,611 --> 00:12:29,447
so I wouldn't have

500
00:12:26,611 --> 00:12:29,447
to be the bad guy.

501
00:12:30,406 --> 00:12:33,785
That's a really good id— Oh.

502
00:12:38,998 --> 00:12:41,083
(gasps)

503
00:12:42,418 --> 00:12:43,837
Whatcha doin'?

504
00:12:43,877 --> 00:12:45,714
You scared me.

505
00:12:43,877 --> 00:12:45,714
(chuckles)

506
00:12:45,755 --> 00:12:46,922
I'll ask again.

507
00:12:46,964 --> 00:12:49,133
What-cha doin'?

508
00:12:49,175 --> 00:12:52,679
Nothing.

509
00:12:49,175 --> 00:12:52,679
Really?

510
00:12:52,721 --> 00:12:54,972
You and Bernadette

511
00:12:52,721 --> 00:12:54,972
aren't doing stuff without me?

512
00:12:55,014 --> 00:12:57,559
What? No!

513
00:12:55,014 --> 00:12:57,559
Why would you even say that?

514
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,352
You know how your talent

515
00:12:59,394 --> 00:13:01,813
is getting just drunk enough

516
00:12:59,394 --> 00:13:01,813
to have a good time

517
00:13:01,855 --> 00:13:03,815
without being hungover

518
00:13:01,855 --> 00:13:03,815
the next day?

519
00:13:03,857 --> 00:13:07,235
Thank you.

520
00:13:03,857 --> 00:13:07,235
(chuckles)

521
00:13:07,276 --> 00:13:10,780
Well, mine is knowing

522
00:13:07,276 --> 00:13:10,780
when I'm being excluded.

523
00:13:10,822 --> 00:13:12,657
So spill.

524
00:13:12,699 --> 00:13:14,701
I'm-I'm just running

525
00:13:12,699 --> 00:13:14,701
some errands.

526
00:13:14,743 --> 00:13:16,870
Yeah?

527
00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:19,414
With a bag full of wine?

528
00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:19,414
I...

529
00:13:19,455 --> 00:13:22,208
Got to stay hydrated.

530
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:24,252
Try again.

531
00:13:24,293 --> 00:13:25,461
Okay, look, I'm sorry.

532
00:13:25,503 --> 00:13:27,171
We did not mean

533
00:13:25,503 --> 00:13:27,171
to leave you out.

534
00:13:27,213 --> 00:13:29,131
All right? Bernadette has

535
00:13:27,213 --> 00:13:29,131
been feeling fried at home,

536
00:13:29,173 --> 00:13:32,260
so we ended up hanging out

537
00:13:29,173 --> 00:13:32,260
in Halley's playhouse.

538
00:13:32,301 --> 00:13:34,888
Like a secret club?

539
00:13:34,928 --> 00:13:37,557
No! Just, like, a

540
00:13:34,928 --> 00:13:37,557
place to spend time

541
00:13:37,599 --> 00:13:39,975
that we don't tell

542
00:13:37,599 --> 00:13:39,975
anyone else about.

543
00:13:42,978 --> 00:13:46,023
And what would be

544
00:13:42,978 --> 00:13:46,023
a shorter way of saying that?

545
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:50,319
(quietly):

546
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:50,319
Secret club.

547
00:13:50,361 --> 00:13:52,530
Well, you really hurt

548
00:13:50,361 --> 00:13:52,530
my feelings.

549
00:13:50,361 --> 00:13:52,530
(sighs)

550
00:13:52,572 --> 00:13:54,490
What can I do to

551
00:13:52,572 --> 00:13:54,490
make it up to you?

552
00:13:54,532 --> 00:13:55,575
I'm in a secret club!

553
00:13:55,617 --> 00:13:57,660
Shh!

554
00:13:57,702 --> 00:14:00,455
Is there some sort

555
00:13:57,702 --> 00:14:00,455
of humiliating initiation?

556
00:14:00,496 --> 00:14:02,874
'Cause I would literally do

557
00:14:00,496 --> 00:14:02,874
anything.

558
00:14:10,506 --> 00:14:12,133
Leonard, you've

559
00:14:10,506 --> 00:14:12,133
been losing to me

560
00:14:12,174 --> 00:14:14,510
in three-dimensional chess

561
00:14:12,174 --> 00:14:14,510
for many years.

562
00:14:14,552 --> 00:14:16,387
You know

563
00:14:14,552 --> 00:14:16,387
what would be neat?

564
00:14:16,429 --> 00:14:18,848
If this was some sort

565
00:14:16,429 --> 00:14:18,848
of long con

566
00:14:18,890 --> 00:14:21,142
and one day you say,

567
00:14:18,890 --> 00:14:21,142
"Let's make this interesting,"

568
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:22,685
put money on it, and reveal

569
00:14:22,727 --> 00:14:25,563
that you actually know

570
00:14:22,727 --> 00:14:25,563
what you're doing.

571
00:14:29,358 --> 00:14:30,944
A very long con indeed.

572
00:14:30,985 --> 00:14:32,320
Checkmate.

573
00:14:30,985 --> 00:14:32,320
(groans)

574
00:14:33,863 --> 00:14:35,573
Sorry. I'm distracted.

575
00:14:35,615 --> 00:14:37,742
Ooh, aren't you the hustler.

576
00:14:37,784 --> 00:14:40,411
No matter

577
00:14:37,784 --> 00:14:40,411
who I give the funds to,

578
00:14:40,453 --> 00:14:42,455
someone is gonna be upset

579
00:14:40,453 --> 00:14:42,455
with me.

580
00:14:42,497 --> 00:14:44,123
Do you really care

581
00:14:42,497 --> 00:14:44,123
if people are angry at you?

582
00:14:44,165 --> 00:14:46,041
Of course.

583
00:14:44,165 --> 00:14:46,041
Interesting.

584
00:14:46,083 --> 00:14:49,086
Why don't you go to the store

585
00:14:46,083 --> 00:14:49,086
and get me some tapioca pudding

586
00:14:49,128 --> 00:14:51,673
or I'm gonna be angry at you.

587
00:14:51,714 --> 00:14:53,341
No.

588
00:14:53,382 --> 00:14:55,343
So it comes and goes?

589
00:14:55,384 --> 00:14:58,387
How do you not care what

590
00:14:55,384 --> 00:14:58,387
people think of you?

591
00:14:58,429 --> 00:14:59,597
It's easy.

592
00:14:59,639 --> 00:15:01,182
I mean, not "beating you

593
00:14:59,639 --> 00:15:01,182
at chess" easy,

594
00:15:01,223 --> 00:15:03,476
but what is?

595
00:15:04,393 --> 00:15:05,687
Wait,

596
00:15:05,728 --> 00:15:07,605
you can make this decision.

597
00:15:07,647 --> 00:15:09,941
You don't care if

598
00:15:07,647 --> 00:15:09,941
you upset people.

599
00:15:09,983 --> 00:15:11,192
You can pick for me.

600
00:15:11,233 --> 00:15:12,234
I certainly could.

601
00:15:12,276 --> 00:15:13,945
Oh, great.

602
00:15:12,276 --> 00:15:13,945
But I won't.

603
00:15:13,987 --> 00:15:16,322
I think this is

604
00:15:13,987 --> 00:15:16,322
a learning opportunity for you.

605
00:15:16,364 --> 00:15:17,907
Sheldon, come on.

606
00:15:17,949 --> 00:15:19,367
Oh, I'm sorry.

607
00:15:17,949 --> 00:15:19,367
Did I upset you?

608
00:15:19,408 --> 00:15:21,953
Yes.

609
00:15:19,408 --> 00:15:21,953
Ask me how I feel about that.

610
00:15:24,914 --> 00:15:26,624
So where does Leonard

611
00:15:24,914 --> 00:15:26,624
think you are?

612
00:15:26,666 --> 00:15:28,334
Oh, I told him

613
00:15:26,666 --> 00:15:28,334
I was at yoga.

614
00:15:28,376 --> 00:15:31,295
(chuckles) Well,

615
00:15:28,376 --> 00:15:31,295
you are stretching the truth.

616
00:15:31,337 --> 00:15:33,297
Yeah. Where does

617
00:15:31,337 --> 00:15:33,297
Sheldon think you are?

618
00:15:33,339 --> 00:15:35,633
Oh, Sheldon's

619
00:15:33,339 --> 00:15:35,633
kind of like a dog—

620
00:15:35,675 --> 00:15:37,426
he doesn't really think about me

621
00:15:35,675 --> 00:15:37,426
when I'm gone,

622
00:15:37,468 --> 00:15:39,846
but he's so happy

623
00:15:37,468 --> 00:15:39,846
when I show up.

624
00:15:40,763 --> 00:15:42,181
(oven dings)

625
00:15:40,763 --> 00:15:42,181
Ooh.

626
00:15:42,223 --> 00:15:44,099
Who wants

627
00:15:42,223 --> 00:15:44,099
an Easy-Bake quesadilla?

628
00:15:44,141 --> 00:15:45,685
Me!

629
00:15:45,727 --> 00:15:46,602
Ooh, hot.

630
00:15:46,644 --> 00:15:48,229
(door closes)

631
00:15:46,644 --> 00:15:48,229
Shh.

632
00:15:48,270 --> 00:15:49,939
KOOTHRAPPALI: Thanks for

633
00:15:48,270 --> 00:15:49,939
letting me come over and hang.

634
00:15:49,981 --> 00:15:52,441
So Leonard still hasn't

635
00:15:49,981 --> 00:15:52,441
made a decision yet?

636
00:15:49,981 --> 00:15:52,441
No.

637
00:15:52,483 --> 00:15:54,276
And I've really been

638
00:15:52,483 --> 00:15:54,276
laying on the guilt.

639
00:15:54,318 --> 00:15:56,111
Did you break out the sad eyes?

640
00:15:56,153 --> 00:15:58,280
You mean these bad boys?

641
00:16:00,533 --> 00:16:02,243
(whispering):

642
00:16:00,533 --> 00:16:02,243
What do we do?

643
00:16:02,284 --> 00:16:04,119
We're just gonna have to wait

644
00:16:02,284 --> 00:16:04,119
till they go back inside.

645
00:16:04,161 --> 00:16:06,706
Okay, okay. Can

646
00:16:04,161 --> 00:16:06,706
we very quietly

647
00:16:06,748 --> 00:16:08,541
open that second bottle of...

648
00:16:08,583 --> 00:16:10,125
(oven dings)

649
00:16:10,167 --> 00:16:12,253
(quietly): Hey,

650
00:16:10,167 --> 00:16:12,253
don't freak out,

651
00:16:12,294 --> 00:16:15,631
but I think there's

652
00:16:12,294 --> 00:16:15,631
someone in your playhouse.

653
00:16:15,673 --> 00:16:18,384
Oh. Yeah,

654
00:16:15,673 --> 00:16:18,384
that's just Bernadette.

655
00:16:20,511 --> 00:16:22,764
She's been hiding out

656
00:16:20,511 --> 00:16:22,764
in there all week. (chuckles)

657
00:16:22,805 --> 00:16:24,682
Really? Why?

658
00:16:24,724 --> 00:16:26,851
(exhales)

659
00:16:24,724 --> 00:16:26,851
I don't know.

660
00:16:26,893 --> 00:16:28,519
She's been

661
00:16:26,893 --> 00:16:28,519
a little overwhelmed at work.

662
00:16:28,561 --> 00:16:31,355
And, frankly,

663
00:16:28,561 --> 00:16:31,355
me and the kids are a lot.

664
00:16:31,397 --> 00:16:34,025
She just... (chuckles)

665
00:16:31,397 --> 00:16:34,025
needs some downtime.

666
00:16:34,067 --> 00:16:36,027
And you just pretend

667
00:16:34,067 --> 00:16:36,027
like you don't know?

668
00:16:36,069 --> 00:16:39,363
Sure. That's

669
00:16:36,069 --> 00:16:39,363
how marriage works.

670
00:16:39,405 --> 00:16:40,990
Three years ago...

671
00:16:39,405 --> 00:16:40,990
(chuckles)

672
00:16:41,032 --> 00:16:43,200
I told her I got life insurance,

673
00:16:43,242 --> 00:16:44,953
and I totally didn't.

674
00:16:44,994 --> 00:16:46,245
(laughs)

675
00:16:46,287 --> 00:16:48,831
Someday, she's gonna find out.

676
00:16:46,287 --> 00:16:48,831
I'm gonna say,

677
00:16:48,873 --> 00:16:52,501
"Ha-ha! I know you've been

678
00:16:48,873 --> 00:16:52,501
hiding in the playhouse."

679
00:16:52,543 --> 00:16:55,004
Why don't you just get

680
00:16:52,543 --> 00:16:55,004
the life insurance?

681
00:16:55,964 --> 00:16:58,007
Whose side are you on?

682
00:16:59,092 --> 00:17:01,594
Can you hear

683
00:16:59,092 --> 00:17:01,594
what they're saying?

684
00:17:01,636 --> 00:17:02,595
Shh, I'm trying.

685
00:17:02,637 --> 00:17:03,638
(cork pops)

686
00:17:03,679 --> 00:17:05,306
Huh.

687
00:17:05,347 --> 00:17:07,224
Sounds like Penny's

688
00:17:05,347 --> 00:17:07,224
in there, too.

689
00:17:09,727 --> 00:17:12,981
Seriously, Leonard,

690
00:17:09,727 --> 00:17:12,981
you didn't pick my project?

691
00:17:13,022 --> 00:17:14,065
I'm sorry, Raj.

692
00:17:14,107 --> 00:17:15,984
Did you go

693
00:17:14,107 --> 00:17:15,984
with Crow Lady?

694
00:17:14,107 --> 00:17:15,984
No.

695
00:17:16,025 --> 00:17:17,401
You gave the money to Kripke?

696
00:17:17,443 --> 00:17:18,319
I did not.

697
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:19,988
Wait, I'm confused.

698
00:17:20,029 --> 00:17:21,906
I thought there were only

699
00:17:20,029 --> 00:17:21,906
three projects in contention.

700
00:17:21,948 --> 00:17:23,950
There were.

701
00:17:21,948 --> 00:17:23,950
But, at the last minute,

702
00:17:23,992 --> 00:17:25,451
someone submitted an application

703
00:17:25,493 --> 00:17:27,954
for a pretty cool

704
00:17:25,493 --> 00:17:27,954
europium-doped laser,

705
00:17:27,996 --> 00:17:29,872
and they made

706
00:17:27,996 --> 00:17:29,872
a very compelling case.

707
00:17:29,914 --> 00:17:31,749
What was the case?

708
00:17:31,791 --> 00:17:35,544
Oh, that it was me

709
00:17:31,791 --> 00:17:35,544
and I wanted it.

710
00:17:35,586 --> 00:17:36,712
You-you can't do that.

711
00:17:36,754 --> 00:17:38,255
You can't just fund

712
00:17:36,754 --> 00:17:38,255
your own project.

713
00:17:38,297 --> 00:17:40,883
Uh, it turns out I can,

714
00:17:38,297 --> 00:17:40,883
and I did.

715
00:17:41,884 --> 00:17:43,344
Interesting.

716
00:17:43,385 --> 00:17:45,179
What about not wanting

717
00:17:43,385 --> 00:17:45,179
everybody to be mad at you?

718
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:47,389
Well, I realized that,

719
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:47,389
no matter what decision I made,

720
00:17:47,431 --> 00:17:48,641
people were gonna be mad at me.

721
00:17:48,683 --> 00:17:51,226
And this way, I get a laser.

722
00:17:51,268 --> 00:17:54,271
That is the most selfish thing

723
00:17:51,268 --> 00:17:54,271
you've ever done.

724
00:17:54,313 --> 00:17:55,523
I'm proud of you.

725
00:17:57,066 --> 00:17:58,734
And I don't care.

726
00:17:57,066 --> 00:17:58,734
Yes, you do.

727
00:17:58,776 --> 00:18:00,361
Yeah, I do.

728
00:18:03,823 --> 00:18:05,867
The europium laser

729
00:18:03,823 --> 00:18:05,867
is so cool.

730
00:18:05,908 --> 00:18:07,869
It has a four-level

731
00:18:05,908 --> 00:18:07,869
f-f transition

732
00:18:07,910 --> 00:18:09,787
which provides for

733
00:18:07,910 --> 00:18:09,787
high power output,

734
00:18:09,829 --> 00:18:12,581
and its quantum efficiency

735
00:18:09,829 --> 00:18:12,581
is off the charts.

736
00:18:12,623 --> 00:18:13,916
What are you going

737
00:18:12,623 --> 00:18:13,916
to use it for?

738
00:18:13,958 --> 00:18:15,501
I have no idea.

739
00:18:19,714 --> 00:18:21,174
Leonard,

740
00:18:21,215 --> 00:18:23,676
there's a crow

741
00:18:21,215 --> 00:18:23,676
on your roof.

742
00:18:23,718 --> 00:18:25,011
I see it.

743
00:18:25,053 --> 00:18:27,930
Is that one

744
00:18:25,053 --> 00:18:27,930
of Dr. Lee's crows?

745
00:18:27,972 --> 00:18:31,017
(caws)

746
00:18:27,972 --> 00:18:31,017
It has a tag on its leg.

747
00:18:31,059 --> 00:18:33,102
(cawing)

748
00:18:34,562 --> 00:18:36,856
Don't make

749
00:18:34,562 --> 00:18:36,856
any sudden moves.

750
00:18:36,898 --> 00:18:39,108
Smart. Let's stand

751
00:18:36,898 --> 00:18:39,108
perfectly still and...

752
00:18:39,150 --> 00:18:41,235
He's the one

753
00:18:39,150 --> 00:18:41,235
you want!

754
00:18:42,444 --> 00:18:43,863
(cawing)
