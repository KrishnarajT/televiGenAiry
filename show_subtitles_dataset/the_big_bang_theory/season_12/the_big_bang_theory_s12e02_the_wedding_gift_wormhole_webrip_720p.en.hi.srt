1
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:11,266
But I think, by the

2
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:11,266
end of the honeymoon,

3
00:00:11,308 --> 00:00:13,894
we really started to feel

4
00:00:11,308 --> 00:00:13,894
like a married couple.

5
00:00:13,936 --> 00:00:15,896
But the good kind,

6
00:00:13,936 --> 00:00:15,896
like on TV,

7
00:00:15,938 --> 00:00:18,315
not like my parents.

8
00:00:15,938 --> 00:00:18,315
Yeah.

9
00:00:18,357 --> 00:00:19,900
You're not a real married couple

10
00:00:18,357 --> 00:00:19,900
until you can pee

11
00:00:19,942 --> 00:00:22,235
with the door open

12
00:00:19,942 --> 00:00:22,235
and she's okay with it.

13
00:00:23,362 --> 00:00:25,906
I told you, I'm

14
00:00:23,362 --> 00:00:25,906
not okay with it.

15
00:00:25,948 --> 00:00:28,450
She loves it.

16
00:00:28,492 --> 00:00:32,079
So, we got everybody gifts.

17
00:00:32,121 --> 00:00:33,497
Aw.

18
00:00:34,581 --> 00:00:36,042
Did you forget about us

19
00:00:36,083 --> 00:00:37,877
until you were at the airport?

20
00:00:37,918 --> 00:00:39,378
No.

21
00:00:39,419 --> 00:00:41,588
We forgot about you

22
00:00:39,419 --> 00:00:41,588
until we were on the plane.

23
00:00:41,630 --> 00:00:42,882
Luckily,

24
00:00:41,630 --> 00:00:42,882
there was Wi-Fi,

25
00:00:42,923 --> 00:00:44,800
and I have Amazon Prime.

26
00:00:46,510 --> 00:00:47,845
I heart New York.

27
00:00:47,887 --> 00:00:50,806
Aw, the baby's gonna love

28
00:00:47,887 --> 00:00:50,806
throwing up on this.

29
00:00:50,848 --> 00:00:52,808
Look, it doesn't have

30
00:00:50,848 --> 00:00:52,808
to just be New York.

31
00:00:52,850 --> 00:00:54,351
That's the beauty of it.

32
00:00:54,393 --> 00:00:57,396
Uh, the initials "N.Y."

33
00:00:54,393 --> 00:00:57,396
can stand for anything you like.

34
00:00:57,437 --> 00:00:58,939
For instance, I

35
00:00:57,437 --> 00:00:58,939
understand that there is

36
00:00:58,981 --> 00:01:01,400
an elderly rock-and-roll

37
00:00:58,981 --> 00:01:01,400
musician named Neil Young.

38
00:01:01,441 --> 00:01:02,943
Perhaps you heart him.

39
00:01:02,985 --> 00:01:06,572
Or if not him, Egyptian

40
00:01:02,985 --> 00:01:06,572
table tennis silver medalist

41
00:01:06,613 --> 00:01:08,574
Noha Yossry.

42
00:01:08,615 --> 00:01:09,783
Or Nana Yamaguchi,

43
00:01:09,825 --> 00:01:11,702
the Japanese voice actress

44
00:01:11,744 --> 00:01:14,371
who starred in

45
00:01:11,744 --> 00:01:14,371
Sally the Witch.

46
00:01:14,413 --> 00:01:16,874
Did you just google

47
00:01:14,413 --> 00:01:16,874
the initials "N.Y."?

48
00:01:16,916 --> 00:01:18,417
I had Wi-Fi and a

49
00:01:16,916 --> 00:01:18,417
long plane flight.

50
00:01:18,458 --> 00:01:20,252
Draw your own

51
00:01:18,458 --> 00:01:20,252
conclusions.

52
00:01:20,293 --> 00:01:24,631
Well, guys, that was very,

53
00:01:20,293 --> 00:01:24,631
very thoughtful of you. I...

54
00:01:27,051 --> 00:01:29,553
Did you get me a double XL?

55
00:01:29,595 --> 00:01:31,638
I told you.

56
00:01:29,595 --> 00:01:31,638

you write a thank you card.

73
00:02:02,044 --> 00:02:03,462
What's wrong with it?

74
00:02:03,503 --> 00:02:05,547
"Dear Aunt Helen,

75
00:02:05,589 --> 00:02:08,050
"thank you so much for

76
00:02:05,589 --> 00:02:08,050
the lovely place setting.

77
00:02:08,092 --> 00:02:09,927
"If my handwriting

78
00:02:08,092 --> 00:02:09,927
looks strained,

00:02:09,969 --> 00:02:12,221
"that is because this is

00:02:09,969 --> 00:02:12,221
the 16th thank you card

"Amy has forced me to write.

82
00:02:14,807 --> 00:02:17,517
"The muscles in my

83
00:02:14,807 --> 00:02:17,517
wrist are cramping

84
00:02:17,559 --> 00:02:21,147
"as I struggle to

85
00:02:17,559 --> 00:02:21,147
finish this sentence.

86
00:02:21,188 --> 00:02:23,149
"Ow, ow, oh, the pain.

87
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:25,358
Love, Sheldon."

88
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:27,778
Fine.

89
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:29,905
"And Amy."

90
00:02:30,864 --> 00:02:32,658
Ow.

91
00:02:32,699 --> 00:02:35,494
This one is from

92
00:02:32,699 --> 00:02:35,494
Leonard and Penny.

93
00:02:35,535 --> 00:02:36,829
Aw.

94
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:39,832
"The perfect gift for

95
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:39,832
the perfect couple."

96
00:02:39,873 --> 00:02:42,876
Save that card. We may need

97
00:02:39,873 --> 00:02:42,876
to throw it back in their faces.

98
00:02:43,836 --> 00:02:45,212
I wonder what it could be.

99
00:02:45,254 --> 00:02:46,839
Oh, could be anything.

100
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:49,091
A flute, a letter opener,

101
00:02:49,133 --> 00:02:50,467
one of those pens

102
00:02:50,509 --> 00:02:52,928
where you put the bikini

103
00:02:50,509 --> 00:02:52,928
back on the naked lady.

104
00:02:53,887 --> 00:02:55,222
Oh.

105
00:02:55,264 --> 00:02:57,808
Isn't this nice?

106
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,478
What is it?

107
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:03,105
You know, it's, uh,

108
00:03:03,147 --> 00:03:05,191
it's one of those...

109
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:10,403
Nope, doesn't do that.

110
00:03:10,445 --> 00:03:11,738
Oh, maybe it's candy.

111
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:14,116
Lick it.

112
00:03:14,158 --> 00:03:16,409
I don't want to

113
00:03:14,158 --> 00:03:16,409
lick it. You lick it.

114
00:03:16,451 --> 00:03:18,620
I'm not gonna lick it.

115
00:03:16,451 --> 00:03:18,620
I just brushed my teeth.

116
00:03:18,662 --> 00:03:20,998
Is it from one of

117
00:03:18,662 --> 00:03:20,998
your dumb sci-fi shows?

118
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:23,750
Uh, none of the sci-fi shows

119
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:23,750
I watch are dumb.

120
00:03:23,792 --> 00:03:26,377
Sheldon...

121
00:03:23,792 --> 00:03:26,377
Okay, Westworld.

122
00:03:26,419 --> 00:03:27,880
But this has nothing

123
00:03:26,419 --> 00:03:27,880
to do with that show,

124
00:03:27,921 --> 00:03:30,132
other than it's

125
00:03:27,921 --> 00:03:30,132
also inexplicable.

126
00:03:30,174 --> 00:03:31,800
Well, Leonard and Penny

127
00:03:30,174 --> 00:03:31,800
are our best friends.

128
00:03:31,842 --> 00:03:33,135
They know us

129
00:03:31,842 --> 00:03:33,135
better than anyone.

130
00:03:33,177 --> 00:03:34,928
They said it's

131
00:03:33,177 --> 00:03:34,928
the perfect gift.

132
00:03:34,970 --> 00:03:37,306
We must be

133
00:03:34,970 --> 00:03:37,306
missing something.

134
00:03:44,479 --> 00:03:45,564
You don't...

135
00:03:45,605 --> 00:03:49,776
think it's a marital

136
00:03:45,605 --> 00:03:49,776
aid, do you?

137
00:03:50,944 --> 00:03:52,487
Don't be silly.

138
00:03:52,529 --> 00:03:56,783
Amy, how is this big glass shaft

139
00:03:52,529 --> 00:03:56,783
going to aid our marriage?

140
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:02,039
Do you think

141
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:02,039
when Krypto the Superdog

142
00:04:02,081 --> 00:04:04,666
is out flying,

143
00:04:02,081 --> 00:04:04,666
Superman has to fly after him

144
00:04:04,708 --> 00:04:06,543
with a little baggie?

145
00:04:06,585 --> 00:04:09,504
Hmm. Haven't really

146
00:04:06,585 --> 00:04:09,504
thought about it before.

147
00:04:09,546 --> 00:04:11,173
But he doesn't

148
00:04:09,546 --> 00:04:11,173
need a baggie,

149
00:04:11,215 --> 00:04:15,177
because he just blasts the

150
00:04:11,215 --> 00:04:15,177
poop with his heat vision.

151
00:04:15,219 --> 00:04:16,511
You've thought about it before.

152
00:04:16,553 --> 00:04:18,347
Oh, I've thought

153
00:04:16,553 --> 00:04:18,347
about it a lot.

154
00:04:16,553 --> 00:04:18,347
(chuckles)

155
00:04:18,389 --> 00:04:19,723
(chuckles)

156
00:04:24,228 --> 00:04:27,022
What is wrong

157
00:04:24,228 --> 00:04:27,022
with Stuart's face?

158
00:04:27,064 --> 00:04:29,983
I think he's smiling.

159
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:32,778
Oh, my God, are

160
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:32,778
they flirting?

161
00:04:32,819 --> 00:04:34,363
Oh, they're

162
00:04:32,819 --> 00:04:34,363
way past flirting.

163
00:04:34,405 --> 00:04:37,283
I caught them making out

164
00:04:34,405 --> 00:04:37,283
at Sheldon's wedding.

165
00:04:37,324 --> 00:04:41,536
Are you sure she wasn't trying

166
00:04:37,324 --> 00:04:41,536
to breathe life back into him?

167
00:04:41,578 --> 00:04:42,829
I don't think so.

168
00:04:42,871 --> 00:04:44,456
When I used that much tongue

169
00:04:42,871 --> 00:04:44,456
at CPR training,

170
00:04:44,497 --> 00:04:47,500
I had to buy the dummy.

171
00:04:47,542 --> 00:04:49,002
Ooh, I have class.

172
00:04:49,044 --> 00:04:49,962
I should go.

173
00:04:50,003 --> 00:04:51,213
Oh. Okay.

174
00:04:51,255 --> 00:04:53,215
Bye.

175
00:04:51,255 --> 00:04:53,215
Bye.

176
00:04:53,257 --> 00:04:54,466
(chuckles)

177
00:04:59,846 --> 00:05:01,640
(both chuckle)

178
00:05:01,681 --> 00:05:03,642
See ya, guys.

179
00:05:03,683 --> 00:05:05,644
Bye.

180
00:05:03,683 --> 00:05:05,644
Bye.

181
00:05:05,685 --> 00:05:08,814
So, what's her deal?

182
00:05:08,855 --> 00:05:11,984
Is she into you or does

183
00:05:08,855 --> 00:05:11,984
she just hate her parents?

184
00:05:12,025 --> 00:05:13,110
I-I don't know.

185
00:05:13,152 --> 00:05:15,112
We kissed a little

186
00:05:13,152 --> 00:05:15,112
at the wedding,

187
00:05:15,154 --> 00:05:16,613
and it was great.

188
00:05:16,655 --> 00:05:18,282
But we haven't really talked

189
00:05:16,655 --> 00:05:18,282
about it since then.

190
00:05:18,324 --> 00:05:20,826
So I-I don't know

191
00:05:18,324 --> 00:05:20,826
how she feels about me.

192
00:05:20,867 --> 00:05:22,619
Well, she patted you

193
00:05:20,867 --> 00:05:22,619
on the head,

194
00:05:22,661 --> 00:05:25,998
so I'm guessing she feels

195
00:05:22,661 --> 00:05:25,998
like you're such a good boy!

196
00:05:26,039 --> 00:05:27,791
(chuckles)

197
00:05:27,833 --> 00:05:30,336
Seriously, do you think

198
00:05:27,833 --> 00:05:30,336
I should ask her out?

199
00:05:30,377 --> 00:05:31,837
A-Absolutely.

200
00:05:31,878 --> 00:05:33,380
Don't let love get away.

201
00:05:33,422 --> 00:05:36,425
It is the most important thing

202
00:05:33,422 --> 00:05:36,425
in the world.

203
00:05:36,467 --> 00:05:38,177
Without it,

204
00:05:36,467 --> 00:05:38,177
life is

205
00:05:38,218 --> 00:05:40,512
dark and meaningless

206
00:05:38,218 --> 00:05:40,512
and all you're left with

207
00:05:40,553 --> 00:05:42,181
is the judgmental gaze

208
00:05:40,553 --> 00:05:42,181
of your dog

209
00:05:42,222 --> 00:05:46,018
as you finish off a bag

210
00:05:42,222 --> 00:05:46,018
of Doritos on the toilet.

211
00:05:46,059 --> 00:05:47,518
Thanks.

212
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:49,938
You're a real good pal.

213
00:05:50,856 --> 00:05:53,359
And now you're

214
00:05:50,856 --> 00:05:53,359
a good boy!

215
00:05:54,734 --> 00:05:56,778
(smooches)

216
00:06:00,949 --> 00:06:02,368
I can't stop thinking

217
00:06:00,949 --> 00:06:02,368
about that present.

218
00:06:02,409 --> 00:06:03,702
It's driving me crazy.

219
00:06:03,743 --> 00:06:04,870
Me, too!

220
00:06:04,911 --> 00:06:06,788
The card said it was

221
00:06:04,911 --> 00:06:06,788
the perfect gift.

222
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:09,875
But it's not a dinosaur fossil

223
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:09,875
or matching pocket watches,

224
00:06:09,916 --> 00:06:12,503
so I don't see

225
00:06:09,916 --> 00:06:12,503
how it can be.

226
00:06:12,543 --> 00:06:13,837
Maybe we're trying too hard.

227
00:06:13,879 --> 00:06:15,339
Maybe it's something simple.

228
00:06:15,381 --> 00:06:16,547
(gasps) Like

229
00:06:15,381 --> 00:06:16,547
Leonard and Penny.

230
00:06:16,589 --> 00:06:18,217
Yes, good.

231
00:06:18,258 --> 00:06:20,344
We just need to

232
00:06:18,258 --> 00:06:20,344
think like them.

233
00:06:20,386 --> 00:06:22,888
(inhales, exhales)

234
00:06:20,386 --> 00:06:22,888
Okay.

235
00:06:22,929 --> 00:06:25,807
What gift can I get us

236
00:06:25,849 --> 00:06:31,355
to express how grateful we are

237
00:06:25,849 --> 00:06:31,355
to have us in their lives?

238
00:06:31,397 --> 00:06:33,606
Way to make it simple.

239
00:06:33,648 --> 00:06:34,858
I'm just gonna ask them.

240
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:37,403
No, you can't;

241
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:37,403
it'll hurt their feelings.

242
00:06:37,444 --> 00:06:39,029
I'm okay with that.

243
00:06:39,071 --> 00:06:40,406
And they'll know

244
00:06:39,071 --> 00:06:40,406
you weren't smart enough

245
00:06:40,447 --> 00:06:41,656
to figure it out

246
00:06:40,447 --> 00:06:41,656
on your own.

247
00:06:41,698 --> 00:06:44,326
You're right.

248
00:06:41,698 --> 00:06:44,326
Oh, this is awful.

249
00:06:44,368 --> 00:06:46,370
And I can't even comfort

250
00:06:44,368 --> 00:06:46,370
myself by stroking

251
00:06:46,412 --> 00:06:49,956
the fossilized tibia

252
00:06:46,412 --> 00:06:49,956
of a Pentaceratops.

253
00:06:49,998 --> 00:06:51,542
Let's just go to sleep.

254
00:06:51,582 --> 00:06:53,584
We'll look at it in the morning

255
00:06:51,582 --> 00:06:53,584
with fresh eyes,

256
00:06:53,626 --> 00:06:54,878
and maybe it'll come to us.

257
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,046
Fine.

258
00:07:02,052 --> 00:07:05,138
Or we go tear apart that box

259
00:07:02,052 --> 00:07:05,138
and look for a clue.

260
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:07,516
Staying up past my bedtime

261
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:07,516
and solving mysteries?

262
00:07:07,558 --> 00:07:09,600
Who knew married life

263
00:07:07,558 --> 00:07:09,600
could be this good?

264
00:07:16,358 --> 00:07:18,651
What's wrong

265
00:07:16,358 --> 00:07:18,651
with his face?

266
00:07:18,693 --> 00:07:20,612
A lot of people have

267
00:07:18,693 --> 00:07:20,612
been asking that.

268
00:07:20,653 --> 00:07:22,322
He's... smiling.

269
00:07:24,657 --> 00:07:26,076
Hey, Stuart,

270
00:07:24,657 --> 00:07:26,076
you look pretty happy.

271
00:07:26,118 --> 00:07:27,327
Oh, yeah.

272
00:07:27,369 --> 00:07:29,621
I, uh, asked Denise out

273
00:07:27,369 --> 00:07:29,621
on a date,

274
00:07:29,662 --> 00:07:31,957
and she said yes.

275
00:07:29,662 --> 00:07:31,957
Aw.

276
00:07:31,998 --> 00:07:33,417
That's great.

277
00:07:33,459 --> 00:07:35,085
But don't smile like that

278
00:07:33,459 --> 00:07:35,085
in front of Halley.

279
00:07:35,127 --> 00:07:37,546
She just started sleeping

280
00:07:35,127 --> 00:07:37,546
through the night.

281
00:07:37,588 --> 00:07:39,214
Sorry. I'm excited.

282
00:07:39,256 --> 00:07:42,384
I haven't been on a date

283
00:07:39,256 --> 00:07:42,384
in a long time.

284
00:07:42,426 --> 00:07:44,010
Back when I was dating,

285
00:07:42,426 --> 00:07:44,010
I'd always wear

286
00:07:44,052 --> 00:07:45,845
a new pair of underwear,

287
00:07:44,052 --> 00:07:45,845
just in case.

288
00:07:45,887 --> 00:07:49,308
It's also been a long time

289
00:07:45,887 --> 00:07:49,308
since I bought new underwear.

290
00:07:49,349 --> 00:07:50,767
And I probably should,

291
00:07:50,809 --> 00:07:54,854
because these are no longer

292
00:07:50,809 --> 00:07:54,854
tighty nor whitey.

293
00:07:54,896 --> 00:07:56,356
Okay, I'm out.

294
00:07:57,899 --> 00:07:59,692
If there's a chance

295
00:07:57,899 --> 00:07:59,692
someone's gonna see you naked,

296
00:07:59,734 --> 00:08:03,363
it's also polite to make sure

297
00:07:59,734 --> 00:08:03,363
you're well-groomed down there.

298
00:08:03,405 --> 00:08:06,283
I get it, Howard.

299
00:08:03,405 --> 00:08:06,283
I've been busy!

300
00:08:09,369 --> 00:08:10,703
Hello.

301
00:08:10,745 --> 00:08:12,247
Hey.

302
00:08:10,745 --> 00:08:12,247
I just wanted

303
00:08:12,289 --> 00:08:15,083
to pop over and hand-deliver

304
00:08:12,289 --> 00:08:15,083
this thank you note

305
00:08:15,125 --> 00:08:17,752
for your very thoughtful

306
00:08:15,125 --> 00:08:17,752
wedding gift.

307
00:08:15,125 --> 00:08:17,752
PENNY: Oh.

308
00:08:17,794 --> 00:08:19,338
Oh, good. You

309
00:08:17,794 --> 00:08:19,338
guys liked it?

310
00:08:19,379 --> 00:08:21,047
Well, we liked it a lot more

311
00:08:21,089 --> 00:08:22,508
than things that aren't it,

312
00:08:22,549 --> 00:08:24,134
I'll tell you that.

313
00:08:24,176 --> 00:08:25,677
Well, yeah, that's great.

314
00:08:25,718 --> 00:08:27,513
Because when we saw it,

315
00:08:25,718 --> 00:08:27,513
we thought, "Amy and Sheldon

316
00:08:27,554 --> 00:08:28,805
just have to have that."

317
00:08:28,847 --> 00:08:30,599
Oh, do tell.

318
00:08:28,847 --> 00:08:30,599
Now, paint a picture for me,

319
00:08:30,641 --> 00:08:32,434
like where you were

320
00:08:30,641 --> 00:08:32,434
when you found it

321
00:08:32,476 --> 00:08:35,646
and what you thought

322
00:08:32,476 --> 00:08:35,646
we'd enjoy doing with it.

323
00:08:37,272 --> 00:08:38,649
Do you not know what it is?

324
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:40,108
PENNY:

325
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:40,108
Of course he knows

326
00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:43,403
what it is. He's

327
00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:43,403
the smartest man in the world.

328
00:08:43,445 --> 00:08:45,947
Well, I don't know

329
00:08:43,445 --> 00:08:45,947
about the world.

330
00:08:45,989 --> 00:08:48,992
Some of those Chinese fellas

331
00:08:45,989 --> 00:08:48,992
are pretty clever.

332
00:08:49,034 --> 00:08:51,077
Now, if you'll excuse me,

333
00:08:49,034 --> 00:08:51,077
I'm going

334
00:08:51,119 --> 00:08:52,954
to return home and use your gift

335
00:08:52,996 --> 00:08:55,832
in the manner

336
00:08:52,996 --> 00:08:55,832
which it was intended.

337
00:08:58,084 --> 00:08:59,252
(laughing)

338
00:08:59,294 --> 00:09:00,712
He-He's never gonna

339
00:08:59,294 --> 00:09:00,712
figure it out.

340
00:09:00,753 --> 00:09:02,673
I know.

341
00:09:00,753 --> 00:09:02,673
(thumping)

342
00:09:02,714 --> 00:09:04,799
SHELDON:

343
00:09:02,714 --> 00:09:04,799
What are you?

344
00:09:05,842 --> 00:09:08,094
Gosh, this makes me happy.

345
00:09:05,842 --> 00:09:08,094
Yeah.

346
00:09:08,136 --> 00:09:09,304
(laughs)

347
00:09:10,514 --> 00:09:13,600
Howard, I don't

348
00:09:10,514 --> 00:09:13,600
often say this,

349
00:09:13,642 --> 00:09:15,352
but, good, you're here. Now,

350
00:09:15,394 --> 00:09:17,145
do you know

351
00:09:17,187 --> 00:09:19,439
what Leonard and Penny got

352
00:09:17,187 --> 00:09:19,439
us for our wedding gift?

353
00:09:19,481 --> 00:09:20,732
Well...

354
00:09:19,481 --> 00:09:20,732
(stammers)

355
00:09:19,481 --> 00:09:20,732
Don't answer.

356
00:09:20,773 --> 00:09:21,900
I don't want to know.

357
00:09:21,941 --> 00:09:23,527
I just want to

358
00:09:21,941 --> 00:09:23,527
know if you know.

359
00:09:23,569 --> 00:09:24,986
I do know.

360
00:09:23,569 --> 00:09:24,986
Okay, great.

361
00:09:25,028 --> 00:09:27,447
I believe that Amy and

362
00:09:25,028 --> 00:09:27,447
I have figured it out.

363
00:09:27,489 --> 00:09:29,741
Is it a clue to

364
00:09:27,489 --> 00:09:29,741
a scavenger hunt

365
00:09:29,782 --> 00:09:32,411
that will lead us

366
00:09:29,782 --> 00:09:32,411
to the actual present?

367
00:09:32,452 --> 00:09:33,912
If you're asking

368
00:09:33,953 --> 00:09:36,248
if you and Amy should spend

369
00:09:33,953 --> 00:09:36,248
the next couple days

370
00:09:36,289 --> 00:09:38,833
running all over town searching

371
00:09:36,289 --> 00:09:38,833
for the next clue,

372
00:09:38,875 --> 00:09:41,878
I'm gonna have to say yes.

373
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:42,921
I knew it!

374
00:09:42,962 --> 00:09:44,297
This is so much fun.

375
00:09:44,339 --> 00:09:46,758
Oh, it really is.

376
00:09:44,339 --> 00:09:46,758
(chuckles)

377
00:09:46,799 --> 00:09:48,343
Oh, Leonard,

378
00:09:46,799 --> 00:09:48,343
thank you again.

379
00:09:48,385 --> 00:09:51,430
We love the gift.

380
00:09:48,385 --> 00:09:51,430
Aw.

381
00:09:51,471 --> 00:09:53,765
Does he know what it is?

382
00:09:51,471 --> 00:09:53,765
No, not even close.

383
00:09:53,806 --> 00:09:55,808
He thinks it's a clue

384
00:09:53,806 --> 00:09:55,808
to a scavenger hunt.

385
00:09:55,850 --> 00:09:57,018
(laughs)

386
00:09:57,060 --> 00:09:59,354
So, so happy.

387
00:09:59,396 --> 00:10:01,147
Well, what is it?

388
00:09:59,396 --> 00:10:01,147
What did you give them?

389
00:10:01,189 --> 00:10:03,609
Oh, i-it's just this

390
00:10:01,189 --> 00:10:03,609
dumb crystal wand

391
00:10:03,650 --> 00:10:06,152
that Howard and Bernadette

392
00:10:03,650 --> 00:10:06,152
gave us for our wedding.

393
00:10:06,194 --> 00:10:07,738
Penny and I

394
00:10:06,194 --> 00:10:07,738
made each other miserable

395
00:10:07,779 --> 00:10:09,740
trying to figure out

396
00:10:07,779 --> 00:10:09,740
what it was, and we thought,

397
00:10:09,781 --> 00:10:13,826
"Why not pass that fun along

398
00:10:09,781 --> 00:10:13,826
to Sheldon and Amy."

399
00:10:13,868 --> 00:10:15,161
Wait a minute. Did—

400
00:10:15,203 --> 00:10:17,414
did you give them the

401
00:10:15,203 --> 00:10:17,414
crystal chakra wand

402
00:10:17,456 --> 00:10:19,874
that I gave you

403
00:10:17,456 --> 00:10:19,874
for your wedding?

404
00:10:21,543 --> 00:10:24,254
Yeah, that's exactly

405
00:10:21,543 --> 00:10:24,254
what we did.

406
00:10:24,296 --> 00:10:26,798
You said you liked it!

407
00:10:26,839 --> 00:10:29,259
Yeah, that's exactly

408
00:10:26,839 --> 00:10:29,259
what I said.

409
00:10:33,263 --> 00:10:36,391
Wow. A scavenger hunt.

410
00:10:36,433 --> 00:10:38,393
That's exciting.

411
00:10:38,435 --> 00:10:40,895
I had a bit of a scavenger hunt

412
00:10:38,435 --> 00:10:40,895
myself last night.

413
00:10:40,937 --> 00:10:42,105
I was trying

414
00:10:40,937 --> 00:10:42,105
to find the remote.

415
00:10:42,147 --> 00:10:44,566
I looked under

416
00:10:42,147 --> 00:10:44,566
one of the cushions.

417
00:10:44,608 --> 00:10:45,984
Wasn't there.

418
00:10:46,025 --> 00:10:48,236
Then I lifted the cushion

419
00:10:46,025 --> 00:10:48,236
a little higher.

420
00:10:48,278 --> 00:10:50,280
Bingo.

421
00:10:50,322 --> 00:10:52,282
Riveting.

422
00:10:52,324 --> 00:10:54,867
So, do you know what it is?

423
00:10:54,909 --> 00:10:56,745
Of course I know what it is.

424
00:10:56,787 --> 00:10:59,956
It's a silicon dioxide crystal,

425
00:10:56,787 --> 00:10:59,956
otherwise known as quartz.

426
00:10:59,998 --> 00:11:02,083
Are you sure?

427
00:11:02,125 --> 00:11:06,087
Am I sure? Is basalt a mafic

428
00:11:02,125 --> 00:11:06,087
extrusive igneous rock formed

429
00:11:06,129 --> 00:11:09,382
by the rapid cooling

430
00:11:06,129 --> 00:11:09,382
of magnesium and iron-rich lava?

431
00:11:09,424 --> 00:11:11,343
Yeah, I'm sure.

432
00:11:11,384 --> 00:11:13,512
Okay, so it's quartz.

433
00:11:13,553 --> 00:11:15,096
That's got

434
00:11:13,553 --> 00:11:15,096
to mean something.

435
00:11:15,138 --> 00:11:16,682
What do we know

436
00:11:15,138 --> 00:11:16,682
about quartz?

437
00:11:16,723 --> 00:11:17,890
I'll google it.

438
00:11:17,932 --> 00:11:19,810
Or you can ask me, the geologist

439
00:11:19,851 --> 00:11:21,770
who won the MacArthur

440
00:11:19,851 --> 00:11:21,770
Genius Grant.

441
00:11:21,812 --> 00:11:24,314
Got it!

442
00:11:24,356 --> 00:11:26,483
Quartz, from the

443
00:11:24,356 --> 00:11:26,483
German "quarz"

444
00:11:26,525 --> 00:11:29,778
which sounds the same, but

445
00:11:26,525 --> 00:11:29,778
is spelled without a "T".

446
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:33,406
Interesting. No "T".

447
00:11:33,448 --> 00:11:35,826
What is not "T"?

448
00:11:35,866 --> 00:11:37,494
Coffee!

449
00:11:37,536 --> 00:11:39,954
The coffee shop

450
00:11:37,536 --> 00:11:39,954
where we first met!

451
00:11:39,996 --> 00:11:42,666
All right, let's go.

452
00:11:39,996 --> 00:11:42,666
Sorry.

453
00:11:42,708 --> 00:11:46,628
I think I just had an adrenaline

454
00:11:42,708 --> 00:11:46,628
rush from having visitors.

455
00:11:49,756 --> 00:11:53,510
Hey, Raj, will you, um,

456
00:11:49,756 --> 00:11:53,510
smell something for me?

457
00:11:53,552 --> 00:11:55,345
Uh, that depends.

458
00:11:55,387 --> 00:11:58,056
Actually, it doesn't depend.

459
00:11:55,387 --> 00:11:58,056
Just no.

460
00:11:58,097 --> 00:12:01,852
I'm trying out some new colognes

461
00:11:58,097 --> 00:12:01,852
for my date with Denise.

462
00:12:01,892 --> 00:12:03,353
Oh, and you just came over here

463
00:12:03,395 --> 00:12:05,772
to rub it in my face

464
00:12:03,395 --> 00:12:05,772
that you have a date?

465
00:12:03,395 --> 00:12:05,772
No.

466
00:12:05,814 --> 00:12:07,733
I came over here

467
00:12:05,814 --> 00:12:07,733
because I need advice,

468
00:12:07,774 --> 00:12:10,652
and you've gone out with

469
00:12:07,774 --> 00:12:10,652
more women than anybody I know.

470
00:12:10,694 --> 00:12:12,571
Huh. I guess you're right.

471
00:12:12,612 --> 00:12:15,198
Sheldon's the smart one,

472
00:12:12,612 --> 00:12:15,198
Howard's the funny one,

473
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:18,076
and apparently,

474
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:18,076
I'm the ladies' man.

475
00:12:18,117 --> 00:12:19,870
Which one's Leonard?

476
00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:21,120
Oh, yeah, right.

477
00:12:21,162 --> 00:12:22,789
I guess Leonard's

478
00:12:21,162 --> 00:12:22,789
the forgettable one.

479
00:12:22,831 --> 00:12:24,708
Okay, let's have a whiff.

480
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:26,501
Oh.

481
00:12:26,543 --> 00:12:29,838
(sniffs)

482
00:12:26,543 --> 00:12:29,838
Hmm. Smells like Paco Rabanne.

483
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:32,257
Ooh, you're good.

484
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:32,257
I bought it at a swap meet.

485
00:12:32,298 --> 00:12:34,843
It's actually called

486
00:12:32,298 --> 00:12:34,843
"Smells Like Paco Rabanne."

487
00:12:34,885 --> 00:12:36,927
It's great.

488
00:12:34,885 --> 00:12:36,927
She's gonna love it.

489
00:12:36,969 --> 00:12:38,555
I hope so.

490
00:12:38,597 --> 00:12:41,641
I really like Denise, and I

491
00:12:38,597 --> 00:12:41,641
don't want to screw this up.

492
00:12:41,683 --> 00:12:43,142
Hey, relax.

493
00:12:43,184 --> 00:12:45,812
Trust your instincts.

494
00:12:43,184 --> 00:12:45,812
That's what I do.

495
00:12:46,813 --> 00:12:48,899
And that works for you?

496
00:12:50,859 --> 00:12:53,904
Actually... no.

497
00:12:55,321 --> 00:12:57,365
I've made a mess of my life,

498
00:12:55,321 --> 00:12:57,365
and I'm...

499
00:12:57,407 --> 00:12:59,659
I'm all alone.

500
00:13:03,413 --> 00:13:05,998
Okay, I think

501
00:13:03,413 --> 00:13:05,998
it'd be best for both of us

502
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:09,419
if I pretend to get

503
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:09,419
a phone call and just walk away.

504
00:13:10,336 --> 00:13:12,631
Yeah, that would be best.

505
00:13:12,672 --> 00:13:15,341
Hello. This is Stuart.

506
00:13:15,383 --> 00:13:17,594
(whispering):

507
00:13:15,383 --> 00:13:17,594
Sorry. I got to take this.

508
00:13:19,095 --> 00:13:21,681
Uh, why, yes, I'd

509
00:13:19,095 --> 00:13:21,681
love to take a survey.

510
00:13:26,436 --> 00:13:28,563
Okay, this is where

511
00:13:26,436 --> 00:13:28,563
we first met.

512
00:13:28,605 --> 00:13:30,148
There's got to be a clue

513
00:13:28,605 --> 00:13:30,148
here somewhere.

514
00:13:30,189 --> 00:13:31,775
(gasps) We sat at that table.

515
00:13:33,693 --> 00:13:35,487
Excuse me.

516
00:13:35,528 --> 00:13:37,405
I'm sorry.

517
00:13:35,528 --> 00:13:37,405
We're on a scavenger hunt.

518
00:13:37,447 --> 00:13:38,657
Just pretend

519
00:13:37,447 --> 00:13:38,657
we're not here.

520
00:13:38,698 --> 00:13:39,574
Oh, I found something!

521
00:13:39,616 --> 00:13:40,784
(shrieks)

522
00:13:39,616 --> 00:13:40,784
It's gum.

523
00:13:44,245 --> 00:13:45,914
Maybe they left it

524
00:13:44,245 --> 00:13:45,914
behind the counter.

525
00:13:45,956 --> 00:13:50,335
I met my wife here,

526
00:13:45,956 --> 00:13:50,335
and we sat at this very table,

527
00:13:50,376 --> 00:13:52,504
so if you play your cards right,

528
00:13:50,376 --> 00:13:52,504
in eight years,

529
00:13:52,545 --> 00:13:53,797
you could marry this woman.

530
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:55,757
That's my sister.

531
00:13:57,801 --> 00:13:59,761
Well, don't tell people.

532
00:13:57,801 --> 00:13:59,761
That's not okay.

533
00:14:01,847 --> 00:14:04,349
Sheldon, look,

534
00:14:01,847 --> 00:14:04,349
I asked the barista

535
00:14:04,390 --> 00:14:05,809
if anyone

536
00:14:04,390 --> 00:14:05,809
left anything for us,

537
00:14:05,851 --> 00:14:08,018
and she said to look

538
00:14:05,851 --> 00:14:08,018
in this lost and found box.

539
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:10,271
But why would it be in

540
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:10,271
the lost and found box?

541
00:14:10,313 --> 00:14:15,025
Because we were lost,

542
00:14:10,313 --> 00:14:15,025
and then we found each other.

543
00:14:15,067 --> 00:14:17,570
It makes perfect sense.

544
00:14:17,612 --> 00:14:20,072
Oh. And look at this.

545
00:14:20,114 --> 00:14:21,491
A locket.

546
00:14:21,533 --> 00:14:23,827
And that stone in front—

547
00:14:21,533 --> 00:14:23,827
I bet it's quartz.

548
00:14:23,869 --> 00:14:25,829
This must be it. This

549
00:14:23,869 --> 00:14:25,829
must be the actual gift.

550
00:14:25,871 --> 00:14:27,037
Open it up.

551
00:14:25,871 --> 00:14:27,037
What's inside?

552
00:14:27,079 --> 00:14:29,708
Nothing. It's empty.

553
00:14:29,749 --> 00:14:31,626
Of course.

554
00:14:31,668 --> 00:14:33,503
Our life together

555
00:14:31,668 --> 00:14:33,503
is just starting,

556
00:14:33,545 --> 00:14:36,172
and they want us to fill

557
00:14:33,545 --> 00:14:36,172
it with our memories.

558
00:14:36,214 --> 00:14:41,260
This might be

559
00:14:36,214 --> 00:14:41,260
the best wedding gift ever.

560
00:14:41,302 --> 00:14:43,304
(gasps) They also left us

561
00:14:41,302 --> 00:14:43,304
a pair of sunglasses

562
00:14:43,346 --> 00:14:45,640
because our

563
00:14:43,346 --> 00:14:45,640
future's so bright!

564
00:14:47,934 --> 00:14:49,936
They thought of everything!

565
00:14:53,732 --> 00:14:55,233
Oh.

566
00:14:55,274 --> 00:14:56,568
Look what Halley drew.

567
00:14:56,609 --> 00:14:58,236
Yeah, she made it at daycare.

568
00:14:58,277 --> 00:14:59,529
It's pretty good, huh?

569
00:14:59,571 --> 00:15:02,240
Is it?

570
00:15:02,281 --> 00:15:05,368
Wow. Gentile moms are tough.

571
00:15:06,327 --> 00:15:07,829
(knocking on door)

572
00:15:07,871 --> 00:15:10,749
STUART: Guys, I need

573
00:15:07,871 --> 00:15:10,749
to show you something,

574
00:15:10,790 --> 00:15:13,793
but you have to promise

575
00:15:10,790 --> 00:15:13,793
not to make fun of me.

576
00:15:13,835 --> 00:15:15,879
Of course.

577
00:15:20,926 --> 00:15:23,428
Whoa.

578
00:15:23,469 --> 00:15:26,097
Yeah. I was worried

579
00:15:23,469 --> 00:15:26,097
about the date

580
00:15:26,138 --> 00:15:29,726
so I got my hair colored to make

581
00:15:26,138 --> 00:15:29,726
me feel a little more confident,

582
00:15:29,768 --> 00:15:33,479
but that just made me look

583
00:15:29,768 --> 00:15:33,479
paler, so I-I got a spray tan.

584
00:15:33,521 --> 00:15:35,065
Have you tried

585
00:15:33,521 --> 00:15:35,065
showering,

586
00:15:35,106 --> 00:15:37,067
seeing if you

587
00:15:35,106 --> 00:15:37,067
could scrub it off?

588
00:15:37,108 --> 00:15:38,818
I did.

589
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:41,613
You're gonna need

590
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:41,613
some new towels.

591
00:15:41,654 --> 00:15:44,240
And a bathmat.

592
00:15:44,282 --> 00:15:46,868
And a toilet seat.

593
00:15:52,832 --> 00:15:55,543
I'm picking her up in an hour.

594
00:15:56,628 --> 00:15:58,755
What am I gonna do?

595
00:15:58,797 --> 00:16:00,465
Don't you mean

596
00:15:58,797 --> 00:16:00,465
what are you gonna

597
00:16:00,506 --> 00:16:02,300
"Oompa Loompa doompety do"?

598
00:16:04,176 --> 00:16:06,178
You said you weren't

599
00:16:04,176 --> 00:16:06,178
gonna make any jokes.

600
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:08,807
I'm sorry. I'll stop.

601
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:08,807
(mouthing)

602
00:16:08,848 --> 00:16:10,266
(giggles)

603
00:16:10,308 --> 00:16:12,060
Look, it's only

604
00:16:10,308 --> 00:16:12,060
a spray tan.

605
00:16:12,102 --> 00:16:13,895
It'll fade in a couple days.

606
00:16:13,937 --> 00:16:15,897
Why don't you cancel

607
00:16:13,937 --> 00:16:15,897
the date and reschedule?

608
00:16:15,939 --> 00:16:18,900
Oh, but I was really

609
00:16:15,939 --> 00:16:18,900
looking forward to tonight.

610
00:16:18,942 --> 00:16:21,152
You know what? Then go.

611
00:16:18,942 --> 00:16:21,152
Tell her what happened.

612
00:16:21,193 --> 00:16:23,404
Maybe she'll be flattered.

613
00:16:21,193 --> 00:16:23,404
WOLOWITZ:

614
00:16:21,193 --> 00:16:23,404
And if not,

615
00:16:23,446 --> 00:16:27,158
swing by the chocolate factory

616
00:16:23,446 --> 00:16:27,158
and see if they're hiring.

617
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:30,078
That wasn't a joke. That was

618
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:30,078
a legitimate suggestion.

619
00:16:32,288 --> 00:16:34,248
(Skype ringing)

620
00:16:35,166 --> 00:16:36,417
DR. KOOTHRAPPALI:

621
00:16:35,166 --> 00:16:36,417
Hello?

622
00:16:36,459 --> 00:16:38,086
Hey, Dad.

623
00:16:38,128 --> 00:16:41,965
Rajesh. What a nice surprise,

624
00:16:38,128 --> 00:16:41,965
calling me on my birthday.

625
00:16:42,007 --> 00:16:46,761
Yes. That's why I'm calling.

626
00:16:46,803 --> 00:16:49,388
And-and what better gift

627
00:16:46,803 --> 00:16:49,388
to give you than the gift

628
00:16:49,430 --> 00:16:52,433
of marrying an Indian woman,

629
00:16:49,430 --> 00:16:52,433
just like you've always wanted.

630
00:16:52,475 --> 00:16:54,310
My goodness, Rajesh,

631
00:16:52,475 --> 00:16:54,310
this is exciting news.

632
00:16:54,352 --> 00:16:55,687
Who is she?

633
00:16:55,728 --> 00:16:57,563
You tell me.

634
00:16:57,605 --> 00:16:58,898
What?

635
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:02,485
I want you

636
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:02,485
to arrange a marriage for me.

637
00:17:02,527 --> 00:17:05,321
I'm just so tired

638
00:17:02,527 --> 00:17:05,321
of being single,

639
00:17:05,363 --> 00:17:09,075
and I'm finally just...

640
00:17:05,363 --> 00:17:09,075
I'm-I'm ready to settle down.

641
00:17:09,117 --> 00:17:11,786
I can't just call up

642
00:17:09,117 --> 00:17:11,786
some girl's dad

643
00:17:11,828 --> 00:17:13,538
and make her marry you.

644
00:17:13,579 --> 00:17:17,249
It's-it's not 2015 anymore.

645
00:17:17,291 --> 00:17:20,503
I know that, but I can't do this

646
00:17:17,291 --> 00:17:20,503
on my own. I need your help.

647
00:17:20,545 --> 00:17:21,963
(sighs)

648
00:17:22,005 --> 00:17:23,589
Well, then, I'm going

649
00:17:22,005 --> 00:17:23,589
to need your help, too.

650
00:17:23,631 --> 00:17:26,759
If I'm going to find a woman

651
00:17:23,631 --> 00:17:26,759
to set you up with,

652
00:17:26,801 --> 00:17:29,595
you're going to need

653
00:17:26,801 --> 00:17:29,595
to stop Instagramming pictures

654
00:17:29,637 --> 00:17:32,640
of you and your dog

655
00:17:29,637 --> 00:17:32,640
wearing matching sweaters.

656
00:17:32,682 --> 00:17:36,227
Fine, if that's what it takes

657
00:17:32,682 --> 00:17:36,227
to show you that I'm serious.

658
00:17:36,268 --> 00:17:37,770
Uh, quick question.

659
00:17:37,812 --> 00:17:39,689
Do you mean just Instagram,

660
00:17:37,812 --> 00:17:39,689
or all my social...?

661
00:17:39,731 --> 00:17:41,566
All of them!

662
00:17:41,607 --> 00:17:43,735
Okay, deal.

663
00:17:43,776 --> 00:17:47,072
All right.

664
00:17:43,776 --> 00:17:47,072
Let me ask you a question.

665
00:17:47,113 --> 00:17:49,281
What do you think of this woman?

666
00:17:49,323 --> 00:17:51,534
Oh. Oh, my God, she's beautiful.

667
00:17:51,576 --> 00:17:54,079
Is that who you're going

668
00:17:51,576 --> 00:17:54,079
to set me up with?

669
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:57,331
No! That's who I'm dating.

670
00:17:59,209 --> 00:18:02,837
But maybe

671
00:17:59,209 --> 00:18:02,837
she has an older sister.

672
00:18:06,257 --> 00:18:08,093
So we put a little picture of me

673
00:18:08,134 --> 00:18:10,595
and a little picture

674
00:18:08,134 --> 00:18:10,595
of Sheldon in it.

675
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:18,269
In-in the locket?

676
00:18:18,310 --> 00:18:19,812
Yes.

677
00:18:19,854 --> 00:18:23,315
That was in

678
00:18:19,854 --> 00:18:23,315
a lost and found box?

679
00:18:23,357 --> 00:18:25,985
Exactly.

680
00:18:26,027 --> 00:18:28,654
Where we hid it?

681
00:18:28,696 --> 00:18:30,949
So really, you gave us

682
00:18:28,696 --> 00:18:30,949
three amazing gifts.

683
00:18:30,990 --> 00:18:32,617
You gave the locket,

684
00:18:30,990 --> 00:18:32,617
the adventure

685
00:18:32,658 --> 00:18:35,661
and the realization

686
00:18:32,658 --> 00:18:35,661
that Amy and I can do anything

687
00:18:35,703 --> 00:18:37,705
as long as we

688
00:18:35,703 --> 00:18:37,705
work together.

689
00:18:37,747 --> 00:18:41,251
We wrote you a special

690
00:18:37,747 --> 00:18:41,251
thank you note.

691
00:18:37,747 --> 00:18:41,251
Oh.

692
00:18:43,502 --> 00:18:45,546
Are those words?

693
00:18:47,882 --> 00:18:49,717
No.

694
00:18:49,759 --> 00:18:53,763
It's a secret code that you two

695
00:18:49,759 --> 00:18:53,763
get to figure out together.

696
00:18:55,347 --> 00:18:58,226
Hint: it's based

697
00:18:55,347 --> 00:18:58,226
on Sanskrit,

698
00:18:58,268 --> 00:19:00,603
but not the Sanskrit

699
00:18:58,268 --> 00:19:00,603
you're thinking of.

700
00:19:00,645 --> 00:19:02,063
(laughs)

701
00:19:02,105 --> 00:19:06,234
And best of all, you can't use

702
00:19:02,105 --> 00:19:06,234
the Internet to cheat.

703
00:19:06,276 --> 00:19:08,360
Because we locked you

704
00:19:06,276 --> 00:19:08,360
out of your Wi-Fi,

705
00:19:08,402 --> 00:19:12,073
and the answer to this

706
00:19:08,402 --> 00:19:12,073
is your new password.

707
00:19:15,618 --> 00:19:18,037
I'm no longer happy.

708
00:19:19,497 --> 00:19:21,791
Hey, guys. Great news.

709
00:19:21,833 --> 00:19:24,210
I'm getting married.

710
00:19:24,252 --> 00:19:27,172
Huh?

711
00:19:24,252 --> 00:19:27,172
What?

712
00:19:24,252 --> 00:19:27,172
No.

713
00:19:28,131 --> 00:19:30,216
Well, I-I haven't met her yet,

714
00:19:30,258 --> 00:19:32,135
but her name is Anu.

715
00:19:32,177 --> 00:19:34,220
My father says she comes

716
00:19:32,177 --> 00:19:34,220
from a good family.

717
00:19:34,262 --> 00:19:35,429
She's in her 30s.

718
00:19:35,471 --> 00:19:37,307
She works

719
00:19:35,471 --> 00:19:37,307
in hospitality management.

720
00:19:37,348 --> 00:19:39,934
So, as long as I can get

721
00:19:37,348 --> 00:19:39,934
through six to ten dates

722
00:19:39,976 --> 00:19:42,728
without revealing

723
00:19:39,976 --> 00:19:42,728
my true self...

724
00:19:44,147 --> 00:19:46,274
this is happening.

725
00:19:46,316 --> 00:19:49,694
I know just what we're giving

726
00:19:46,316 --> 00:19:49,694
them for a wedding gift.

727
00:19:55,616 --> 00:19:56,701
Oh.

728
00:19:58,203 --> 00:19:59,996
Oh, my God.

729
00:20:00,038 --> 00:20:01,914
Yeah.

730
00:20:01,956 --> 00:20:04,000
I wanted to look my best

731
00:20:01,956 --> 00:20:04,000
for our date,

732
00:20:04,042 --> 00:20:09,421
and I made a series

733
00:20:04,042 --> 00:20:09,421
of bad decisions...

734
00:20:10,756 --> 00:20:15,427
one of which is hidden

735
00:20:10,756 --> 00:20:15,427
by my pants.

736
00:20:15,469 --> 00:20:17,763
Wow. (laughs)

737
00:20:17,805 --> 00:20:21,392
Do you still want

738
00:20:17,805 --> 00:20:21,392
to go out with me?

739
00:20:21,433 --> 00:20:25,730
Absolutely. Hey, maybe we

740
00:20:21,433 --> 00:20:25,730
can go find Nemo together.

741
00:20:25,771 --> 00:20:27,940
That's a good one.

742
00:20:27,982 --> 00:20:29,901
(clears throat)

743
00:20:29,942 --> 00:20:32,570
Do your 63 other crayon

744
00:20:29,942 --> 00:20:32,570
friends know you're out?

745
00:20:32,611 --> 00:20:34,697
Are you just gonna

746
00:20:32,611 --> 00:20:34,697
make fun of me all night?

747
00:20:34,739 --> 00:20:36,366
Probably.

748
00:20:34,739 --> 00:20:36,366
Great.

749
00:20:36,407 --> 00:20:38,034
So what are we thinking,

750
00:20:36,407 --> 00:20:38,034
Chinese?

751
00:20:38,076 --> 00:20:40,703
Yeah, I'm in the mood

752
00:20:38,076 --> 00:20:40,703
for orange chicken.
