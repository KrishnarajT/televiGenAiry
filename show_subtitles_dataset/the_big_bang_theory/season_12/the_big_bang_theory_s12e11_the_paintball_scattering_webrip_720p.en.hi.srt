1
00:00:03,515 --> 00:00:05,213
Champagne, a champagne,

2
00:00:05,255 --> 00:00:09,173
a champagne
with a packet of Splenda in it.

3
00:00:09,217 --> 00:00:12,176
- You know what I call this drink?
- A waste of champagne?

4
00:00:12,219 --> 00:00:14,526
No. A Dr. Cooper.

5
00:00:15,702 --> 00:00:17,007
Because...

6
00:00:17,051 --> 00:00:19,531
He's alsosweet and bubbly.

7
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:22,534
All right.

8
00:00:22,578 --> 00:00:25,014
A... a toast
to Sheldon and Amy

9
00:00:25,058 --> 00:00:27,322
and the publication
of your super-asymmetry paper.

10
00:00:27,365 --> 00:00:29,366
We are so proud of you guys.

11
00:00:29,411 --> 00:00:31,630
- Cheers.
- Thanks.

12
00:00:33,371 --> 00:00:35,721
Ooh! That is PhD-licious.

13
00:00:37,679 --> 00:00:39,813
So, have you guys gotten
any feedback yet?

14
00:00:39,856 --> 00:00:41,335
Well, there are
some comments online,

15
00:00:41,379 --> 00:00:43,685
but we haven't read them.
We decided we don't care

16
00:00:43,730 --> 00:00:45,948
what people say about our work.
- Good for you.

17
00:00:45,993 --> 00:00:48,081
People online
can be so mean.

18
00:00:48,124 --> 00:00:50,039
I posted a picture of myself
on Instagram,

19
00:00:50,084 --> 00:00:52,825
and some jerk said I looked
so skinny I might disappear.

20
00:00:53,870 --> 00:00:56,133
And yet,
somehow she soldiers on.

21
00:00:56,176 --> 00:00:57,874
Mm.

22
00:00:57,917 --> 00:01:00,615
Although, Amy and I did
give the world a gift.

23
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:03,706
It would be nice to read
some of the thank-you notes.

24
00:01:03,749 --> 00:01:06,708
I'm surprised you're interested
in some stranger's opinion.

25
00:01:06,753 --> 00:01:09,145
Well, as I always say,
a stranger's just a friend

26
00:01:09,190 --> 00:01:10,669
who hasn't complimented me yet.

27
00:01:11,758 --> 00:01:13,107
Okay.

28
00:01:13,149 --> 00:01:14,804
- I'll read them.
- If any of them

29
00:01:14,848 --> 00:01:18,112
accuse you of being too pretty,
Penny can help you through it.

30
00:01:19,721 --> 00:01:24,465
Okay, here's one
from Dr. Saltzberg at UCLA.

31
00:01:24,508 --> 00:01:26,423
Wait, no, stop.
I don't want to know.
What if he's mean?

32
00:01:26,467 --> 00:01:28,035
Well, what if
he's complimentary?

33
00:01:28,078 --> 00:01:29,993
I want to know.

34
00:01:30,036 --> 00:01:32,038
Okay. He says...

35
00:01:32,081 --> 00:01:33,649
I don't want to know. All right,
just...

36
00:01:33,693 --> 00:01:35,172
let me see it.

37
00:01:36,651 --> 00:01:38,871
Okay, this is...
this is really positive.

38
00:01:38,914 --> 00:01:40,395
Wow, it's,

39
00:01:40,437 --> 00:01:41,788
like, reallypositive.

40
00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:45,095
He says it might be
the discovery of the decade.

41
00:01:46,488 --> 00:01:48,228
He's right.
They love it!

42
00:01:48,271 --> 00:01:49,664
This is so exciting.

43
00:01:49,709 --> 00:01:51,753
Oh, this may be the
Dr. Cooper talking,

44
00:01:51,798 --> 00:01:53,581
but pour me
another Dr. Cooper.

Hey, Penny and I
were thinking of getting

54
00:02:24,874 --> 00:02:26,353
a big paintball game together.

55
00:02:26,396 --> 00:02:28,181
Oh, Leonard,
why does she want

56
00:02:28,225 --> 00:02:30,444
to shoot you?

57
00:02:30,488 --> 00:02:31,924
She doesn't want to shoot me.

58
00:02:31,967 --> 00:02:33,274
- Who doesn't want to shoot you?
- Penny.

59
00:02:33,316 --> 00:02:34,753
No, that doesn't sound right.

60
00:02:36,625 --> 00:02:38,061
She just wants
to play paintball.

61
00:02:38,104 --> 00:02:39,932
It combines my love of whimsy

62
00:02:39,976 --> 00:02:42,586
with her love
of making grown men cry.

63
00:02:42,631 --> 00:02:44,981
Sounds fun.
Bernadette and I are in.

64
00:02:45,025 --> 00:02:47,679
- You don't need to ask her?
- No. I've been pretty annoying lately.

65
00:02:47,722 --> 00:02:49,811
She's gonna want
to shoot me.

66
00:02:49,856 --> 00:02:51,247
Dr. Cooper.

67
00:02:51,292 --> 00:02:52,684
Ah, President Siebert.

68
00:02:52,727 --> 00:02:54,556
What are you doing
in the regular cafeteria?

69
00:02:54,598 --> 00:02:55,905
You're a superstar.

70
00:02:55,948 --> 00:02:57,907
No offense, worker bees.

71
00:02:57,950 --> 00:02:59,779
You should join me
in my private dining room.

72
00:02:59,822 --> 00:03:01,997
Dr. Fowler is already there.

73
00:03:02,042 --> 00:03:03,390
Can I bring my friends?

74
00:03:03,434 --> 00:03:06,001
No.

75
00:03:06,045 --> 00:03:07,829
Can I bring my tater tots? Yes.

76
00:03:07,874 --> 00:03:09,876
All right, let's go.

77
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:13,880
Welcome to
the inner sanctum.

78
00:03:13,923 --> 00:03:16,186
Oh, I do love
a good sanctum.

79
00:03:17,971 --> 00:03:20,146
Sheldon, look at my fruit plate.
It's got kiwi on it.

80
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:21,757
Ugh. I don't like kiwi.

81
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:24,934
Neither do I, but it's so fancy.

82
00:03:24,977 --> 00:03:26,282
Well, this is nice.

83
00:03:26,327 --> 00:03:28,633
Why have we waited
so long to do this?

84
00:03:28,676 --> 00:03:31,245
Because you
never invited us.

85
00:03:31,287 --> 00:03:33,856
Ha-ha-ha!

86
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:36,859
Well, the important thing
is you're here now,

87
00:03:36,902 --> 00:03:38,600
and we're so excited
about your work.

88
00:03:38,643 --> 00:03:40,949
This paper's going to do
big things for all of us,

89
00:03:40,994 --> 00:03:42,646
so if there's anything
that you need...

90
00:03:42,691 --> 00:03:45,085
You know, actually, I could use
some barbecue sauce for my tots.

91
00:03:45,127 --> 00:03:46,912
Oh, wait. No. Ketchup.

92
00:03:46,955 --> 00:03:49,828
Can we have some barbecue
sauce and ketchup over here?

93
00:03:49,871 --> 00:03:51,787
Both?

94
00:03:52,961 --> 00:03:54,834
So this is how
the other half lives.

95
00:03:56,270 --> 00:03:59,054
I just want you to know
that you have our full support,

96
00:03:59,098 --> 00:04:01,144
and we're organizing
a big media push.

97
00:04:01,187 --> 00:04:02,884
Articles.
Interviews.

98
00:04:02,929 --> 00:04:05,018
Oh, you want us
to do interviews?

99
00:04:05,061 --> 00:04:07,758
Well, we're thinking
a divide-and-conquer
approach here,

100
00:04:07,803 --> 00:04:09,239
where you do the interviews,

101
00:04:09,282 --> 00:04:12,241
and Sheldon stays here
and holds down the fort.

102
00:04:12,286 --> 00:04:14,026
You know...

103
00:04:14,069 --> 00:04:15,418
in case there's an emergency.

104
00:04:15,462 --> 00:04:18,292
What kind of an emergency
would there be in physics?

105
00:04:18,335 --> 00:04:20,597
I don't know, maybe there's
an object in motion

106
00:04:20,642 --> 00:04:22,078
that won't stay in motion.

107
00:04:22,121 --> 00:04:23,557
Or a reaction

108
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,515
that's equal but not opposite.

109
00:04:25,559 --> 00:04:27,953
It sounds like

110
00:04:27,996 --> 00:04:30,869
you don't want Sheldon
to do the interviews.

111
00:04:30,912 --> 00:04:33,088
It's not that we don't want
Sheldonto do the interviews,

112
00:04:33,133 --> 00:04:34,960
it's just that we really
want youto do the interviews.

113
00:04:36,092 --> 00:04:38,138
Without Sheldon.

114
00:04:38,181 --> 00:04:39,748
Now, wait, wait,

115
00:04:39,791 --> 00:04:41,532
are you trying
to exclude me?

116
00:04:41,575 --> 00:04:43,099
Look, Sheldon,
you're a brilliant man,

117
00:04:43,143 --> 00:04:44,840
but your people skills are...

118
00:04:44,883 --> 00:04:46,450
This is not barbecue sauce!

119
00:04:46,494 --> 00:04:48,277
This is steak sauce!
What are you trying to pull?

120
00:04:48,321 --> 00:04:49,888
Like that.

121
00:04:49,931 --> 00:04:51,280
This is ridiculous.

122
00:04:51,325 --> 00:04:53,893
It is my work, too,
and I am perfectly capable

123
00:04:53,936 --> 00:04:56,068
of keeping it together
for an interview.

124
00:04:56,112 --> 00:04:59,158
Okay. Say somebody asks
if you feel your work

125
00:04:59,201 --> 00:05:02,770
is derivative of the work
of Professor Joseph Polchinski.

126
00:05:11,953 --> 00:05:14,914
Seriously, can we get
this man some barbecue sauce!

127
00:05:18,265 --> 00:05:20,267
Would you mind stocking these?

128
00:05:20,309 --> 00:05:22,138
Actually, I'm not
on the clock today.

129
00:05:22,181 --> 00:05:23,792
I'm just hanging out
with my boyfriend.

130
00:05:23,835 --> 00:05:25,749
Ah, cool. Huh.

131
00:05:25,794 --> 00:05:27,448
That's me, right?

132
00:05:27,491 --> 00:05:29,145
Oh, I forgot to tell you—

133
00:05:29,188 --> 00:05:31,191
I broke up with you,
and now I'm

134
00:05:31,234 --> 00:05:34,063
dating... that guy.

135
00:05:34,107 --> 00:05:35,629
I know you're joking,

136
00:05:35,672 --> 00:05:38,676
but my flight-or-flight
response doesn't.

137
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,677
Isn't it fight-or-flight?

138
00:05:40,722 --> 00:05:43,333
Not for me.

139
00:05:43,376 --> 00:05:45,770
So I told my mom
she just needed to back off.

140
00:05:45,813 --> 00:05:47,424
This is our wedding,

141
00:05:47,467 --> 00:05:48,773
and if anyone's gonna design
the floral arrangements,

142
00:05:48,816 --> 00:05:51,907
it's going to be my man.

143
00:05:51,950 --> 00:05:53,474
Thank you.

144
00:05:53,517 --> 00:05:55,998
I mean, I-I'm not trying
to be a groomzilla,

145
00:05:56,042 --> 00:05:58,739
but... this is my specialty.

146
00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:03,571
Someone texting you?

147
00:06:03,614 --> 00:06:05,006
Uh, no. It's just my,

148
00:06:05,051 --> 00:06:07,227
uh, doorbell camera.

149
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:10,011
Oh. I got one of those for my
place, but I never installed it.

150
00:06:10,056 --> 00:06:11,665
Oh, it's easy.
I can do it for you.

151
00:06:11,708 --> 00:06:13,407
You're gonna love it.
It's how I found out

152
00:06:13,450 --> 00:06:16,758
a raccoon was stealing my
cheese-of-the-month club.

153
00:06:16,801 --> 00:06:18,107
What did you do?

154
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:20,109
Nothing. I didn't
want to piss it off.

155
00:06:20,152 --> 00:06:21,806
It was, like, huge from
eating all the cheese.

156
00:06:24,025 --> 00:06:25,941
Hey. We're doing a big
paintball game on Saturday

157
00:06:25,984 --> 00:06:27,551
if you two want to join.

158
00:06:27,595 --> 00:06:29,552
Oh, my roommate asked me to
help her move out on Saturday.

159
00:06:29,597 --> 00:06:31,251
Ugh. That sucks.

160
00:06:31,294 --> 00:06:32,816
Sucks for her.
I'm playing paintball.

161
00:06:34,515 --> 00:06:36,821
I-I didn't know
your roommate was moving out.

162
00:06:36,864 --> 00:06:38,780
Yeah. I've been looking
for a new one,

163
00:06:38,823 --> 00:06:41,217
but... so far no luck.

164
00:06:41,261 --> 00:06:42,696
You hear that?

165
00:06:42,739 --> 00:06:45,220
She needs a roommate.

166
00:06:52,881 --> 00:06:54,838
What do you think, Stuart?

167
00:06:54,883 --> 00:06:56,840
Uh, i-i-it, uh...

168
00:06:56,884 --> 00:06:58,799
Flight.

169
00:06:58,842 --> 00:07:00,018
Flight.

170
00:07:05,023 --> 00:07:07,590
- That was hard to watch.
- Yeah.

171
00:07:11,638 --> 00:07:15,511
Okay, I need you to
be honest with me.

172
00:07:15,556 --> 00:07:17,210
How do I look?

173
00:07:20,126 --> 00:07:23,215
A little shorter, but as we age
that happens to all of us.

174
00:07:23,258 --> 00:07:25,087
Come on, help me out here.

175
00:07:25,131 --> 00:07:27,611
I've got a bunch
of interviews today.

176
00:07:27,655 --> 00:07:30,919
Well, no one'll notice.
They never met you before.

177
00:07:30,962 --> 00:07:32,921
Sheldon, I'm nervous,

178
00:07:32,963 --> 00:07:34,792
and I wish you were
coming with me.

179
00:07:34,835 --> 00:07:37,491
If it helps, I wrote up
some possible questions

180
00:07:37,533 --> 00:07:38,840
and answers for you.

181
00:07:40,188 --> 00:07:42,148
"Whom do you love more,

182
00:07:42,191 --> 00:07:45,542
"Sheldon the scientist
or Sheldon the man?

183
00:07:47,326 --> 00:07:49,241
"Answer: Sheldon
the scientist,

184
00:07:49,285 --> 00:07:52,636
but by such a slim margin
that it's statistically
insignificant."

185
00:07:54,116 --> 00:07:57,640
Well, you really managed
to capture my voice.

186
00:07:57,684 --> 00:07:59,556
Well, don't worry.
I'm sure you're gonna do great.

187
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,210
Thank you.

188
00:08:01,253 --> 00:08:03,037
- Okay, bye.
- Wait-wait-wait.

189
00:08:03,082 --> 00:08:05,388
- You forgot the cards.
- Love you, too.

190
00:08:08,696 --> 00:08:10,871
Really? She asked you
to move in with her?

191
00:08:10,914 --> 00:08:12,177
Yeah, she was

192
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:13,439
hinting around about it,

193
00:08:13,482 --> 00:08:15,659
but I think I handled it
pretty well.

194
00:08:16,746 --> 00:08:18,357
"Pretty well"?

195
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:21,273
You ran out of there so fast,
if it was a cartoon,

196
00:08:21,316 --> 00:08:23,927
there would have been a
Stuart-shaped hole in the wall.

197
00:08:25,277 --> 00:08:26,539
Was she mad?

198
00:08:26,583 --> 00:08:28,150
Uh, no. I talked to her after.

199
00:08:28,193 --> 00:08:29,629
She said she's fine.

200
00:08:29,672 --> 00:08:31,893
- Oh, no. - Yikes!
- You'll find someone new.

201
00:08:34,243 --> 00:08:35,897
Everything okay?

202
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:37,551
Yeah, it's just
Anu's doorbell camera.

203
00:08:37,594 --> 00:08:38,986
I helped her install it.

204
00:08:39,029 --> 00:08:40,728
You can't look at it.
That's spying.

205
00:08:40,771 --> 00:08:42,163
Who the hell is this guy?

206
00:08:42,207 --> 00:08:42,990
Ooh, let me see.

207
00:08:45,559 --> 00:08:47,125
He's got... bags.

208
00:08:47,168 --> 00:08:48,648
He's probably
just delivering food.

209
00:08:50,476 --> 00:08:52,173
Why is she hugging him?

210
00:08:52,218 --> 00:08:53,957
Maybe she doesn't
have tip money?

211
00:08:56,090 --> 00:08:58,527
W-Wait, why is she
inviting him into the house?

212
00:08:58,571 --> 00:09:00,878
She's a good tipper?

213
00:09:03,446 --> 00:09:06,927
Do you ever feel guilty
that we get to eat

214
00:09:06,970 --> 00:09:09,757
in the fancy dining room
while our friends have to
eat in the regular one?

215
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:13,412
Yes. Wait, did you say
"guilty" or "happy"?

216
00:09:13,455 --> 00:09:15,066
"Guilty."

217
00:09:15,109 --> 00:09:17,243
Oh, then no.

218
00:09:17,286 --> 00:09:20,984
In fact, take a picture
of me with the garlic
knots to send them.

219
00:09:21,028 --> 00:09:22,812
There's my MVP—

220
00:09:22,856 --> 00:09:24,641
Most Valuable Physicist.

221
00:09:24,685 --> 00:09:26,207
Thank you.

222
00:09:26,252 --> 00:09:28,297
And my star
of NPR Science Friday

223
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:31,431
and a potpourri
of popular podcasts.

224
00:09:31,474 --> 00:09:35,303
I don't know if I'd
use the word "star."

225
00:09:35,348 --> 00:09:38,437
I would. I got an early look at
the interview you did for Wired,

226
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,700
and it is glowing.
They loved you.

227
00:09:40,744 --> 00:09:42,354
That's great.
Thanks for telling me.

228
00:09:42,398 --> 00:09:43,572
Congratulations, Amy.

229
00:09:43,617 --> 00:09:45,532
I'm so proud of you. And that headline—

230
00:09:45,575 --> 00:09:48,490
"The Neurobiologist
Who Revolutionized Physics."

231
00:09:48,534 --> 00:09:51,537
I'm sorry.
The who who did what to— huh?

232
00:10:00,154 --> 00:10:02,287
Oh, hey,
how did your interview go?

233
00:10:02,330 --> 00:10:04,158
Okay, I guess.

234
00:10:04,202 --> 00:10:05,725
You don't sound
very happy.

235
00:10:05,768 --> 00:10:07,205
Oh, why wouldn't
she be happy?

236
00:10:07,249 --> 00:10:09,599
She's the neurobiologist
who revolutionized physics.

237
00:10:09,643 --> 00:10:12,601
Sorry.

238
00:10:12,646 --> 00:10:16,258
This should be fun.
I've never played before.

239
00:10:16,301 --> 00:10:18,433
Oh, fair warning— it can
get pretty ugly out there.

240
00:10:18,478 --> 00:10:20,696
Okay, well, remember,
I'm your fiancée.

241
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:23,090
Oh, I remember. Do you?

242
00:10:24,223 --> 00:10:26,094
All right, we need two teams.

243
00:10:26,137 --> 00:10:27,617
Who wants to be the captain?

244
00:10:27,661 --> 00:10:28,965
Oh, me.

245
00:10:29,009 --> 00:10:30,706
Uh, sure.
Why not?

246
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:32,360
All right, why don't
you pick first?

247
00:10:32,404 --> 00:10:34,971
Okay, um... Leonard.

248
00:10:35,015 --> 00:10:37,758
Yeah?

249
00:10:37,801 --> 00:10:39,106
No, I'm picking you.

250
00:10:39,149 --> 00:10:41,630
First? For a team?

251
00:10:41,675 --> 00:10:45,069
What is happening?

252
00:10:45,113 --> 00:10:47,984
All right,
I take Bernadette.

253
00:10:48,028 --> 00:10:50,465
Really?
You're picking her over me?

254
00:10:50,509 --> 00:10:53,252
Yeah, 'cause she's vicious
and can hide behind a mushroom.

255
00:10:54,426 --> 00:10:56,384
Um... Sheldon.

256
00:10:56,428 --> 00:10:58,952
Raj.

257
00:10:58,995 --> 00:11:00,955
Amy.

258
00:11:00,998 --> 00:11:02,129
I'll take Anu.

259
00:11:07,134 --> 00:11:07,961
Howard.

260
00:11:09,528 --> 00:11:11,138
All rightie.

261
00:11:11,181 --> 00:11:14,838
Come on, pick me, pick me.

262
00:11:14,882 --> 00:11:17,013
I will take... Stuart!

263
00:11:17,057 --> 00:11:18,277
Yes!

264
00:11:21,454 --> 00:11:22,889
Okay, guys, we
need some people

265
00:11:22,932 --> 00:11:24,673
to stay here and
guard the flag

266
00:11:24,718 --> 00:11:26,459
and some people to move out
and try to capture theirs.

267
00:11:26,502 --> 00:11:28,243
Okay. Sheldon,
do you want to stay here and...?

268
00:11:28,287 --> 00:11:29,504
What? Hold down the fort?
'Cause that's all I'm good for.

269
00:11:29,548 --> 00:11:30,680
Is that what you
were going to say?

270
00:11:30,724 --> 00:11:32,508
You know
that's not what he meant.

271
00:11:32,551 --> 00:11:33,639
Oh, why don't
you go out there?

272
00:11:33,682 --> 00:11:34,815
Maybe you'll be
the neurobiologist

273
00:11:34,858 --> 00:11:36,163
who revolutionizes
paintball.

274
00:11:36,206 --> 00:11:38,731
Stop it.
You're being ridiculous.

275
00:11:38,774 --> 00:11:41,211
Am I? Maybe it's just
my poor people skills.

276
00:11:41,255 --> 00:11:44,519
Oh, it's definitely
your poor people skills.

277
00:11:44,563 --> 00:11:46,566
All right, the choices are—
get shot at

278
00:11:46,609 --> 00:11:48,132
or stay here
and listen to them fight.

279
00:11:48,176 --> 00:11:51,004
Shot at.

280
00:11:56,271 --> 00:11:59,013
This is pretty exciting,
sneaking around like this.

281
00:11:59,056 --> 00:12:02,755
Oh, so you like sneaking around.
Good to know.

282
00:12:02,798 --> 00:12:04,758
What's that
supposed to mean?

283
00:12:04,801 --> 00:12:06,499
Nothing. Never mind.

284
00:12:06,542 --> 00:12:08,500
Let me see
if the coast is clear.

285
00:12:12,330 --> 00:12:16,204
- See anybody?
- Yes, I saw a strange man going
into your house the other night!

286
00:12:16,247 --> 00:12:18,249
What?

287
00:12:18,292 --> 00:12:20,163
But out there,
there's nobody.

288
00:12:30,652 --> 00:12:32,437
Ow!

289
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,309
I'm hit.

290
00:12:34,353 --> 00:12:36,398
Ow!

291
00:12:36,441 --> 00:12:38,486
I said I was hit!

292
00:12:38,531 --> 00:12:39,358
Sorry.

293
00:12:40,575 --> 00:12:43,273
Ow!

294
00:12:43,317 --> 00:12:45,364
Why do you keep shooting me?

295
00:12:45,407 --> 00:12:47,408
Why don't you want
to move in with me?

296
00:12:47,452 --> 00:12:50,019
I-I didn't say I didn't want to.

297
00:12:50,063 --> 00:12:52,500
No, you just ran away.

298
00:12:52,545 --> 00:12:54,110
Stuart?

299
00:12:55,634 --> 00:12:57,418
Stuart?

300
00:12:57,463 --> 00:12:59,421
Did you run away again?

301
00:12:59,465 --> 00:13:01,379
No!

302
00:13:02,468 --> 00:13:04,773
Bang, you're out.

303
00:13:04,817 --> 00:13:07,210
What? I'm not out.

304
00:13:07,254 --> 00:13:08,430
You didn't even shoot me.

305
00:13:08,474 --> 00:13:09,778
I'm not gonna shoot you
from right here.

306
00:13:09,822 --> 00:13:11,041
It's too close.
It's gonna hurt.

307
00:13:11,085 --> 00:13:13,392
Oh, come on. It's not
gonna hurt that bad.

308
00:13:13,435 --> 00:13:15,829
I'm telling you, from
this distance it's gonna... Ow!

309
00:13:15,872 --> 00:13:18,353
See? That hurt!

310
00:13:18,397 --> 00:13:20,834
All right. Fine,
you can shoot me.

311
00:13:20,877 --> 00:13:22,401
No, I'm not gonna shoot you.
Ow!

312
00:13:24,446 --> 00:13:26,229
Ow! Ow!

313
00:13:26,273 --> 00:13:29,233
Aah, you were right.
We're way too close.

314
00:13:29,277 --> 00:13:30,713
See, I told you
it's gonna hurt...

315
00:13:30,757 --> 00:13:32,975
Ow!

316
00:13:33,019 --> 00:13:35,065
I can't believe
you're taking this out on me.

317
00:13:35,109 --> 00:13:37,590
I was just trying to get
publicity for ourpaper.

318
00:13:37,633 --> 00:13:39,547
By making it seem
like it was your idea?

319
00:13:39,591 --> 00:13:42,028
I didn't write the headline,
Sheldon.

320
00:13:42,071 --> 00:13:43,465
Did you even read the article?

321
00:13:43,508 --> 00:13:45,728
Because I talk
about you continuously.

322
00:13:45,772 --> 00:13:48,687
I know, and it just made you
sound modest and charming.

323
00:13:51,473 --> 00:13:54,562
Why can't you just
be proud of me?

324
00:13:54,606 --> 00:13:56,869
I am proud of you.

325
00:13:56,912 --> 00:13:59,654
Really?
Because you sound jealous.

326
00:13:59,699 --> 00:14:01,614
Well, I'm that, too.
I've seen Inside Out.

327
00:14:01,657 --> 00:14:03,745
I know I can feel
two things at once.

328
00:14:05,748 --> 00:14:08,489
Ow!
Ow!

329
00:14:08,533 --> 00:14:11,450
Well, now I feel
three things.

330
00:14:14,495 --> 00:14:16,455
Hey.

331
00:14:16,498 --> 00:14:17,455
Who shot you?

332
00:14:17,499 --> 00:14:19,762
Oh. Uh, oh...

333
00:14:19,806 --> 00:14:22,764
Denise, uh, Denise, Denise,
Denise, Denise,

334
00:14:22,808 --> 00:14:24,287
Denise, Denise, Denise,

335
00:14:24,331 --> 00:14:26,638
Denise, Denise,
Denise, Denise

336
00:14:26,681 --> 00:14:29,468
and me when I was running
from Denise.

337
00:14:29,511 --> 00:14:32,513
What is up with you two?

338
00:14:32,557 --> 00:14:34,777
Well, it's kind of
hard to explain. Uh,

339
00:14:34,821 --> 00:14:37,736
you know when things
are going great, but you worry

340
00:14:37,779 --> 00:14:39,869
that any minute
you might screw everything up?

341
00:14:39,912 --> 00:14:42,916
No.
Yes.

342
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:45,918
If you really like her, you
can't let fear get in the way.

343
00:14:45,961 --> 00:14:47,747
You have to move forward.

344
00:14:47,790 --> 00:14:51,359
And at a certain point, the fear
of losing her goes away?

345
00:14:51,402 --> 00:14:52,926
I will let you know.

346
00:14:55,537 --> 00:14:57,713
- You were spying on me?
- That is not the point.

347
00:14:57,757 --> 00:14:59,932
The point is who was that man?

348
00:14:59,975 --> 00:15:02,065
Fine. That was
my ex-boyfriend.

349
00:15:02,109 --> 00:15:04,197
Some of his stuff
was still at my house,

350
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:06,026
and he stopped by
to pick it up.

351
00:15:06,069 --> 00:15:09,725
And did you give it to him?
Did you give him his stuff?

352
00:15:09,768 --> 00:15:14,556
If "stuff" means
sex, then no.

353
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:17,950
If "stuff" means his
Waterpik, then yes!

354
00:15:17,994 --> 00:15:19,430
I got the flag!

355
00:15:19,474 --> 00:15:21,562
I'm gonna make a run for it.
Cover me!

356
00:15:23,522 --> 00:15:26,960
So you're still talking
to your ex-boyfriend?

357
00:15:27,003 --> 00:15:29,223
Yes, and I'm not gonna
apologize for that.

358
00:15:29,266 --> 00:15:31,225
And you need to delete
that app from your phone.

359
00:15:31,268 --> 00:15:32,748
Because you're hiding
something from me?

360
00:15:32,792 --> 00:15:34,445
No, because you
should trust me!

361
00:15:34,489 --> 00:15:37,273
How can I trust you?
I barely even know you!

362
00:15:39,928 --> 00:15:41,801
Then what are we doing?

363
00:15:41,844 --> 00:15:43,672
Why are we planning
a wedding?

364
00:15:43,715 --> 00:15:45,673
I don't know.

365
00:15:48,329 --> 00:15:49,634
Aah,

366
00:15:49,677 --> 00:15:51,157
sad man!

367
00:15:55,465 --> 00:15:56,685
Ow!

368
00:15:56,729 --> 00:15:59,731
Ha, ha! Oh. It's you.

369
00:15:59,774 --> 00:16:01,297
I can't believe you shot me!

370
00:16:01,341 --> 00:16:02,517
I can't believe I did, either.

371
00:16:02,561 --> 00:16:04,388
Right in the chest.

372
00:16:04,431 --> 00:16:06,739
Sorry. That's gonna
leave a bruise.

373
00:16:06,782 --> 00:16:09,132
Yeah, a big one.

374
00:16:09,176 --> 00:16:11,351
Does it hurt?
A little.

375
00:16:11,394 --> 00:16:14,572
Want to kiss it
and make it better?

376
00:16:14,615 --> 00:16:16,444
I do.

377
00:16:20,186 --> 00:16:21,623
Where are you going?

378
00:16:21,667 --> 00:16:23,320
Home.

379
00:16:23,364 --> 00:16:26,585
Don't worry. I'll wave to
the doorbell when I get there.

380
00:16:26,628 --> 00:16:28,021
Wait, wait, wait.

381
00:16:28,063 --> 00:16:29,630
At least let me drive you.

382
00:16:29,675 --> 00:16:31,110
That's okay. I'll Uber.

383
00:16:31,153 --> 00:16:32,894
We can take you.

384
00:16:32,938 --> 00:16:35,027
Come on, Sheldon. Okay.

385
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:37,595
But I should warn you,
we're in a bit of a spat.

386
00:16:37,638 --> 00:16:39,205
At least I think we are.
Amy, are we still in a spat?

387
00:16:39,249 --> 00:16:40,599
Are you ready to apologize?

388
00:16:40,642 --> 00:16:42,339
We are.

389
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,388
Aha! WOLOWITZ:
Hey!

390
00:16:48,431 --> 00:16:50,390
Get out! Sorry. Sorry.

391
00:16:50,434 --> 00:16:51,913
I didn't see anything.

392
00:16:51,957 --> 00:16:53,046
Actually, could I...?

393
00:16:53,089 --> 00:16:54,307
Ooh, thank you!

394
00:17:02,446 --> 00:17:06,188
Hey.

395
00:17:06,233 --> 00:17:08,365
Wow. That's a lot of bruises.

396
00:17:08,408 --> 00:17:12,630
Yeah, well,
you shot me a lot of times.

397
00:17:14,807 --> 00:17:18,331
That's not even counting
the bruises on the inside.

398
00:17:18,375 --> 00:17:19,767
'Cause I hurt your feelings?

399
00:17:19,811 --> 00:17:23,511
Let's hope that's all it is.

400
00:17:23,553 --> 00:17:27,122
Ah, look, I'm sorry
that I freaked out.

401
00:17:27,167 --> 00:17:30,517
It's just that things are
going so good with us,

402
00:17:30,561 --> 00:17:34,303
and I'm afraid that if we go
too fast, I am gonna mess it up.

403
00:17:34,348 --> 00:17:37,568
I get that. I don't want
to mess things up, either.

404
00:17:39,439 --> 00:17:42,530
Um, I got you something.

405
00:17:42,572 --> 00:17:47,142
It's a key to my place
to show you that I'm serious.

406
00:17:47,186 --> 00:17:48,753
Thank you.Mm.

407
00:17:48,797 --> 00:17:50,625
Well, isn't this technically

408
00:17:50,668 --> 00:17:54,194
a key to Howard
and Bernadette's place?

409
00:17:54,236 --> 00:17:57,676
Yes, so don't ever use it or
let them know that you have it.

410
00:17:57,718 --> 00:17:59,851
Come here. Oh. Uh, no.

411
00:17:59,895 --> 00:18:04,420
I appreciate it, but
seriously, this is all bruise.

412
00:18:04,465 --> 00:18:06,161
Kiss?

413
00:18:06,205 --> 00:18:08,120
Gently.

414
00:18:10,471 --> 00:18:12,515
Ow.

415
00:18:14,256 --> 00:18:16,433
I'm about to start recording.
Are you guys ready?

416
00:18:16,476 --> 00:18:18,478
Sheldon, are you ready?

417
00:18:18,522 --> 00:18:20,655
Absolutely. Great.

418
00:18:20,698 --> 00:18:23,613
So, Dr. Cooper,
my first question is for you.

419
00:18:23,657 --> 00:18:26,356
Oh, goody.

420
00:18:26,399 --> 00:18:28,619
Would you say that your paper
is an extension

421
00:18:28,663 --> 00:18:30,969
of the work
of Professor Joseph Polchinski?

422
00:18:48,857 --> 00:18:50,728
I'll be in the car.
