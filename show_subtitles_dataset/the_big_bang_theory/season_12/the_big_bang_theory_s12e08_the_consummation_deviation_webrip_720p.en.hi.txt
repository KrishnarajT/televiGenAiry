1
00:00:09,138 --> 00:00:11,599
Hey, you guys have any

2
00:00:09,138 --> 00:00:11,599
plans for Valentine's Day?

3
00:00:11,641 --> 00:00:13,059
Three months from now? No.

4
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:14,935
What? No?

5
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:14,935
I mean,

6
00:00:14,977 --> 00:00:18,147
secret romantic plans that

7
00:00:14,977 --> 00:00:18,147
would be ruined if I told you.

8
00:00:14,977 --> 00:00:18,147
Oh.

9
00:00:19,815 --> 00:00:21,484
What's going on, Raj?

10
00:00:21,526 --> 00:00:23,611
Well, how would

11
00:00:21,526 --> 00:00:23,611
you guys feel

12
00:00:23,653 --> 00:00:25,446
about going to India

13
00:00:23,653 --> 00:00:25,446
for my wedding?

14
00:00:25,488 --> 00:00:27,948
Oh, that's so exciting!

15
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:30,201
Penny, you will never guess

16
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:30,201
what I have planned

17
00:00:30,243 --> 00:00:33,079
for Valentine's Day.

18
00:00:30,243 --> 00:00:33,079
Uh-huh.

19
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:35,540
Can I feed peanuts to

20
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:35,540
the elephants at your wedding?

21
00:00:35,582 --> 00:00:38,376
That is such a stereotype!

22
00:00:35,582 --> 00:00:38,376
There won't be any elephants?

23
00:00:38,418 --> 00:00:39,752
Of course there'll be elephants.

24
00:00:39,793 --> 00:00:42,296
It's a stereotype

25
00:00:39,793 --> 00:00:42,296
that you feed them peanuts.

26
00:00:42,338 --> 00:00:44,840
Are you really gonna plan

27
00:00:42,338 --> 00:00:44,840
a wedding in three months?

28
00:00:44,882 --> 00:00:47,134
Yeah, well, her family's

29
00:00:44,882 --> 00:00:47,134
doing most of the work.

30
00:00:47,176 --> 00:00:49,470
They're amazing.

31
00:00:47,176 --> 00:00:49,470
We talk all the time.

32
00:00:49,512 --> 00:00:50,638
Why?

33
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:52,640
Because we're

34
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:52,640
about to get married

35
00:00:52,682 --> 00:00:54,350
and they're gonna be my family.

36
00:00:54,392 --> 00:00:57,937
Amy and I are married, and

37
00:00:54,392 --> 00:00:57,937
I never talk to her family.

38
00:00:57,978 --> 00:00:59,355
Really? My parents

39
00:00:57,978 --> 00:00:59,355
love Leonard.

40
00:00:59,397 --> 00:01:01,566
Yeah. And my mom loves

41
00:00:59,397 --> 00:01:01,566
Penny, which is weird,

42
00:01:01,608 --> 00:01:04,318
because I never

43
00:01:01,608 --> 00:01:04,318
knew she could love.

44
00:01:05,361 --> 00:01:07,655
And my dad has grown

45
00:01:05,361 --> 00:01:07,655
to really...

46
00:01:07,697 --> 00:01:10,450
like Howard.

47
00:01:10,491 --> 00:01:13,994
Yeah, there's a nice...

48
00:01:10,491 --> 00:01:13,994
coolness between us.

49
00:01:14,036 --> 00:01:16,163
Hey, guys,

50
00:01:14,036 --> 00:01:16,163
before Anu gets here,

51
00:01:16,205 --> 00:01:18,791
can I talk about

52
00:01:16,205 --> 00:01:18,791
the seating situation?

53
00:01:18,832 --> 00:01:20,334
I really don't want her

54
00:01:18,832 --> 00:01:20,334
to sit on the floor.

55
00:01:20,376 --> 00:01:23,087
Oh. No problem.

56
00:01:20,376 --> 00:01:23,087
Bernadette, floor.

57
00:01:23,129 --> 00:01:25,172
Hey!

58
00:01:23,129 --> 00:01:25,172
Yeah, you can't

59
00:01:23,129 --> 00:01:25,172
make my wife

60
00:01:25,214 --> 00:01:26,882
sit on the floor.

61
00:01:25,214 --> 00:01:26,882
Fine.

62
00:01:26,924 --> 00:01:28,926
Howard, floor.

63
00:01:28,968 --> 00:01:30,470
Fine, I'll sit on the floor.

64
00:01:30,511 --> 00:01:31,929
Thank you, Penny.

65
00:01:30,511 --> 00:01:31,929
And, Leonard,

66
00:01:31,971 --> 00:01:33,681
I was kind of hoping

67
00:01:31,971 --> 00:01:33,681
I could sit next to Anu.

68
00:01:33,723 --> 00:01:35,683
So now I have to

69
00:01:33,723 --> 00:01:35,683
sit on the floor?

70
00:01:33,723 --> 00:01:35,683
It's my house.

71
00:01:35,725 --> 00:01:37,268
Why can't Sheldon

72
00:01:35,725 --> 00:01:37,268
sit on the floor?

73
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:40,020
That might be

74
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:40,020
the dumbest thing

75
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:40,020
you've ever said.

76
00:01:40,062 --> 00:01:41,813
WOLOWITZ:

77
00:01:40,062 --> 00:01:41,813
Guys, guys,

78
00:01:41,855 --> 00:01:43,483
there's a simple solution.

79
00:01:43,524 --> 00:01:46,902
I am not breaking up with her.

80
00:01:48,154 --> 00:01:51,324
All right. Let's

81
00:01:48,154 --> 00:01:51,324
keep thinking.

82
00:01:51,365 --> 00:01:53,660
Hey, everybody, it's Anu.

83
00:01:53,701 --> 00:01:54,952
Hi.

84
00:01:54,994 --> 00:01:56,412

Oh, I am stuffed!

102
00:02:24,231 --> 00:02:26,609
I should not have eaten

103
00:02:24,231 --> 00:02:26,609
all those dumplings.

104
00:02:26,651 --> 00:02:28,778
(chuckles)

105
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:30,237
I think we should have sex.

106
00:02:30,279 --> 00:02:32,532
(passing horn honks)

107
00:02:33,907 --> 00:02:36,327
(squeakily):

108
00:02:33,907 --> 00:02:36,327
Me, too.

109
00:02:36,369 --> 00:02:38,078
Yeah, it's just,

110
00:02:36,369 --> 00:02:38,078
we haven't done it yet,

111
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,539
and I think it's important

112
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:41,415
to make sure we're compatible

113
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:41,415
before we get married.

114
00:02:41,457 --> 00:02:42,875
I totally agree.

115
00:02:42,916 --> 00:02:44,335
Oh, just one question.

116
00:02:44,377 --> 00:02:46,337
While we're doing it,

117
00:02:44,377 --> 00:02:46,337
can I leave my shirt on?

118
00:02:46,379 --> 00:02:49,882
You know, the dumplings,

119
00:02:46,379 --> 00:02:49,882
pretty salty.

120
00:02:49,923 --> 00:02:52,009
It doesn't have

121
00:02:49,923 --> 00:02:52,009
to be tonight.

122
00:02:52,051 --> 00:02:53,469
How about this weekend?

123
00:02:53,511 --> 00:02:55,262
I can get us a room

124
00:02:53,511 --> 00:02:55,262
at my hotel.

125
00:02:55,304 --> 00:02:56,472
Okay. Sounds nice.

126
00:02:56,514 --> 00:02:58,349
We can order

127
00:02:56,514 --> 00:02:58,349
a bunch of room service,

128
00:02:58,391 --> 00:03:01,811
because I'm not eating anything

129
00:02:58,391 --> 00:03:01,811
between now and then.

130
00:03:01,853 --> 00:03:03,730
Aw. Are you worried?

131
00:03:03,771 --> 00:03:04,938
I am not worried.

132
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:07,525
If anything, I'm overconfident.

133
00:03:07,567 --> 00:03:10,069
Edging into smug.

134
00:03:11,195 --> 00:03:12,864
I'm sure it's

135
00:03:11,195 --> 00:03:12,864
gonna be fine.

136
00:03:12,904 --> 00:03:14,866
Oh, it's gonna be

137
00:03:12,904 --> 00:03:14,866
better than fine.

138
00:03:14,906 --> 00:03:16,950
Trust me,

139
00:03:14,906 --> 00:03:16,950
I've had no complaints.

140
00:03:16,992 --> 00:03:18,910
Good to know.

141
00:03:18,952 --> 00:03:20,413
Well, I've had

142
00:03:18,952 --> 00:03:20,413
questions, comments,

143
00:03:20,454 --> 00:03:21,831
some constructive criticism,

144
00:03:21,873 --> 00:03:24,208
(snorts):

145
00:03:21,873 --> 00:03:24,208
but... no complaints.

146
00:03:26,918 --> 00:03:28,796
You're up early.

147
00:03:28,838 --> 00:03:31,048
Huh? Yes. I wanted

148
00:03:28,838 --> 00:03:31,048
to get a jump

149
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:33,217
on planning

150
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:33,217
a day of fun for you.

151
00:03:33,259 --> 00:03:34,594
Oh, that's sweet.

152
00:03:33,259 --> 00:03:34,594
What are we doing?

153
00:03:34,635 --> 00:03:36,679
Oh, no. Just you.

154
00:03:34,635 --> 00:03:36,679
I have other plans.

155
00:03:38,222 --> 00:03:41,893
Now, would you prefer

156
00:03:38,222 --> 00:03:41,893
to see The Grinch in 2-D or 3-D?

157
00:03:41,933 --> 00:03:44,270
I don't want to see it at all.

158
00:03:44,311 --> 00:03:47,774
Well, let's go 2-D. No sense

159
00:03:44,311 --> 00:03:47,774
in spending extra money.

160
00:03:47,815 --> 00:03:49,692
What are you

161
00:03:47,815 --> 00:03:49,692
gonna be doing?

162
00:03:49,734 --> 00:03:51,277
Being a great husband.

163
00:03:51,318 --> 00:03:53,738
Yeah, you're gonna need

164
00:03:51,318 --> 00:03:53,738
to show your work on that.

165
00:03:54,906 --> 00:03:57,032
After last night,

166
00:03:54,906 --> 00:03:57,032
I got to thinking

167
00:03:57,074 --> 00:04:00,077
that I should have a better

168
00:03:57,074 --> 00:04:00,077
relationship with your family.

169
00:04:00,119 --> 00:04:02,246
I think the one you have

170
00:04:00,119 --> 00:04:02,246
with them is perfect.

171
00:04:02,288 --> 00:04:03,664
I hardly have one at all.

172
00:04:03,706 --> 00:04:05,750
Which is perfect.

173
00:04:05,792 --> 00:04:07,877
Oh, Amy, they're

174
00:04:05,792 --> 00:04:07,877
important to you,

175
00:04:07,919 --> 00:04:09,754
and you're

176
00:04:07,919 --> 00:04:09,754
important to me.

177
00:04:09,796 --> 00:04:11,422
Therefore, according to

178
00:04:09,796 --> 00:04:11,422
the transitive property,

179
00:04:11,464 --> 00:04:13,466
they're important to me.

180
00:04:11,464 --> 00:04:13,466
It's the same reason

181
00:04:13,507 --> 00:04:15,342
I'm interested

182
00:04:13,507 --> 00:04:15,342
in your big, flat feet.

183
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:19,889
Well, you know

184
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:19,889
that my mom can be...

185
00:04:19,931 --> 00:04:22,391
well, difficult

186
00:04:19,931 --> 00:04:22,391
to get along with.

187
00:04:19,931 --> 00:04:22,391
Which is why

188
00:04:22,433 --> 00:04:25,519
I'm starting with your dad

189
00:04:22,433 --> 00:04:25,519
and working my way up.

190
00:04:25,561 --> 00:04:27,146
All right.

191
00:04:25,561 --> 00:04:27,146
I'm just worried

192
00:04:27,187 --> 00:04:29,440
you might have

193
00:04:27,187 --> 00:04:29,440
a rather unpleasant day.

194
00:04:29,482 --> 00:04:31,066
Yeah, back at ya.

195
00:04:29,482 --> 00:04:31,066
I watched the trailer

196
00:04:31,108 --> 00:04:32,735
for The Grinch—

197
00:04:31,108 --> 00:04:32,735
it looks terrible.

198
00:04:34,528 --> 00:04:36,489
(knocking)

199
00:04:36,530 --> 00:04:38,908
Hi, Sheldon.

200
00:04:36,530 --> 00:04:38,908
Oh, good.

201
00:04:36,530 --> 00:04:38,908
You're right on time.

202
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:41,201
Hi, Daddy.

203
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:41,201
Hey, pumpkin.

204
00:04:41,243 --> 00:04:44,497
Pumpkin? I've been

205
00:04:41,243 --> 00:04:44,497
calling her spaghetti squash.

206
00:04:44,538 --> 00:04:46,123
It's amazing

207
00:04:44,538 --> 00:04:46,123
that one woman

208
00:04:46,165 --> 00:04:48,626
can be different vegetables

209
00:04:46,165 --> 00:04:48,626
to different men.

210
00:04:48,668 --> 00:04:50,210
Bye.

211
00:04:50,252 --> 00:04:51,671
Bye.

212
00:04:51,712 --> 00:04:53,673
So, how does this work

213
00:04:51,712 --> 00:04:53,673
with in-laws?

214
00:04:53,714 --> 00:04:55,716
Am I supposed

215
00:04:53,714 --> 00:04:55,716
to be calling you Dad?

216
00:04:55,758 --> 00:04:57,009
Because I don't want to.

217
00:04:57,050 --> 00:04:59,345
You don't have to.

218
00:04:57,050 --> 00:04:59,345
Oh, thanks, Larry.

219
00:04:59,386 --> 00:05:01,347
Ooh. That doesn't

220
00:04:59,386 --> 00:05:01,347
sound right.

221
00:05:01,388 --> 00:05:04,141
(gasps) Maybe I should pick

222
00:05:01,388 --> 00:05:04,141
a vegetable for you.

223
00:05:06,602 --> 00:05:08,646
(video game noises on TV)

224
00:05:08,688 --> 00:05:10,648
Hey, Leonard, can you pause

225
00:05:08,688 --> 00:05:10,648
the game for a second?

226
00:05:10,690 --> 00:05:13,526
Uh, hang on.

227
00:05:10,690 --> 00:05:13,526
I'm about to beat Howard.

228
00:05:13,567 --> 00:05:14,819
What? Hey!

229
00:05:14,861 --> 00:05:16,445
What?

230
00:05:16,487 --> 00:05:17,905
He's our friend.

231
00:05:17,947 --> 00:05:20,157
What's up, pal?

232
00:05:21,701 --> 00:05:23,953
I... I don't know

233
00:05:21,701 --> 00:05:23,953
how else to say this,

234
00:05:23,995 --> 00:05:27,832
but, um, Anu and I are going

235
00:05:23,995 --> 00:05:27,832
to have sex tonight.

236
00:05:27,874 --> 00:05:30,083
Yeah...

237
00:05:31,210 --> 00:05:33,754
Do you know how creepy

238
00:05:31,210 --> 00:05:33,754
that sounds?

239
00:05:33,796 --> 00:05:36,173
Yeah...

240
00:05:38,384 --> 00:05:41,595
So, is this the first time?

241
00:05:38,384 --> 00:05:41,595
Yeah.

242
00:05:41,637 --> 00:05:43,639
How you feeling

243
00:05:41,637 --> 00:05:43,639
about it?

244
00:05:41,637 --> 00:05:43,639
Uh...

245
00:05:43,681 --> 00:05:45,474
to be honest,

246
00:05:43,681 --> 00:05:45,474
I'm pretty anxious.

247
00:05:45,516 --> 00:05:48,561
I mean, this is the woman I'm

248
00:05:45,516 --> 00:05:48,561
marrying— what if it's no good?

249
00:05:48,602 --> 00:05:50,187
Do we break up?

250
00:05:48,602 --> 00:05:50,187
Do we...

251
00:05:50,229 --> 00:05:53,106
sign on for a lifetime

252
00:05:50,229 --> 00:05:53,106
of mediocre sex?

253
00:05:53,148 --> 00:05:55,150
Just don't put

254
00:05:53,148 --> 00:05:55,150
so much pressure on it.

255
00:05:55,192 --> 00:05:57,236
It's always a little awkward

256
00:05:55,192 --> 00:05:57,236
in the beginning.

257
00:05:57,277 --> 00:05:59,655
I remember the first time

258
00:05:57,277 --> 00:05:59,655
I slept with Penny.

259
00:05:59,697 --> 00:06:00,698
It was bad?

260
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:03,116
Oh, it was awesome!

261
00:06:05,411 --> 00:06:08,664
I will replay it in my head

262
00:06:05,411 --> 00:06:08,664
until the day I die.

263
00:06:08,706 --> 00:06:10,833
WOLOWITZ:

264
00:06:08,706 --> 00:06:10,833
Well, if it helps,

265
00:06:08,706 --> 00:06:10,833
I was really nervous

266
00:06:10,875 --> 00:06:12,501
my first time with Bernie.

267
00:06:12,543 --> 00:06:17,256
Mostly because I was worried

268
00:06:12,543 --> 00:06:17,256
my mom would walk in.

269
00:06:17,297 --> 00:06:18,089
Did she?

270
00:06:18,131 --> 00:06:20,426
Yea— Yeah.

271
00:06:21,677 --> 00:06:23,178
BERNADETTE:

272
00:06:21,677 --> 00:06:23,178
I'll tell you

273
00:06:21,677 --> 00:06:23,178
one thing.

274
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:25,180
Lock the door.

275
00:06:25,222 --> 00:06:27,558
Yeah, Raj, you're

276
00:06:25,222 --> 00:06:27,558
gonna be fine.

277
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,560
Just break out some

278
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,560
of your Kama Sutra moves.

279
00:06:29,602 --> 00:06:31,562
I don't really know

280
00:06:29,602 --> 00:06:31,562
any of that stuff.

281
00:06:31,604 --> 00:06:33,731
I just pretend I do

282
00:06:31,604 --> 00:06:33,731
to impress women.

283
00:06:33,773 --> 00:06:34,774
And by the way,

284
00:06:34,815 --> 00:06:36,400
Anu is Indian—

285
00:06:34,815 --> 00:06:36,400
she's gonna know

286
00:06:36,442 --> 00:06:39,987
there's no sexual position

287
00:06:36,442 --> 00:06:39,987
called a "screeching lotus."

288
00:06:40,029 --> 00:06:41,781
Screeching lotus?

289
00:06:41,822 --> 00:06:44,575
Sometimes I get leg cramps.

290
00:06:41,822 --> 00:06:44,575
It's my cover story.

291
00:06:45,701 --> 00:06:47,494
Look, she's probably

292
00:06:45,701 --> 00:06:47,494
nervous, too.

293
00:06:47,536 --> 00:06:50,121
Yeah, what if you're great

294
00:06:47,536 --> 00:06:50,121
and she's bad?

295
00:06:50,163 --> 00:06:51,290
How can she be bad?

296
00:06:51,331 --> 00:06:54,209
Raj, women can be

297
00:06:51,331 --> 00:06:54,209
bad at sex, too.

298
00:06:54,251 --> 00:06:56,587
(laughs):

299
00:06:54,251 --> 00:06:56,587
No, that's silly.

300
00:07:00,091 --> 00:07:02,175
Hey, have you checked

301
00:07:00,091 --> 00:07:02,175
the dates on these?

302
00:07:02,217 --> 00:07:03,886
They're all expired.

303
00:07:03,928 --> 00:07:06,889
You buy candy in a comic book

304
00:07:03,928 --> 00:07:06,889
store, you get what you get.

305
00:07:07,974 --> 00:07:09,934
It's called

306
00:07:07,974 --> 00:07:09,934
Lethal Weapon,

307
00:07:09,976 --> 00:07:11,685
but isn't that

308
00:07:09,976 --> 00:07:11,685
redundant?

309
00:07:11,727 --> 00:07:13,520
Aren't weapons,

310
00:07:11,727 --> 00:07:13,520
by their very nature, lethal?

311
00:07:13,562 --> 00:07:15,230
I suppose you're right.

312
00:07:15,272 --> 00:07:17,733
Yeah, and don't even get me

313
00:07:15,272 --> 00:07:17,733
started on Unsolved Mysteries.

314
00:07:17,775 --> 00:07:20,152
I didn't get you started

315
00:07:17,775 --> 00:07:20,152
on Lethal Weapon.

316
00:07:20,193 --> 00:07:23,990
All right, this is another one

317
00:07:20,193 --> 00:07:23,990
of my favorite places,

318
00:07:24,031 --> 00:07:26,909
the comic book store.

319
00:07:24,031 --> 00:07:26,909
Feel free to look around.

320
00:07:26,951 --> 00:07:30,830
Vintage comics in back,

321
00:07:26,951 --> 00:07:30,830
vintage candy right here.

322
00:07:30,871 --> 00:07:32,832
What are you guys up to?

323
00:07:32,873 --> 00:07:35,459
Oh, father-in-law,

324
00:07:32,873 --> 00:07:35,459
son-in-law bonding.

325
00:07:32,873 --> 00:07:35,459
It's going great.

326
00:07:35,501 --> 00:07:37,544
Look at what he bought me

327
00:07:35,501 --> 00:07:37,544
at the train store.

328
00:07:37,586 --> 00:07:39,296
(blows whistle)

329
00:07:39,338 --> 00:07:42,466
Yeah, it sounded louder

330
00:07:39,338 --> 00:07:42,466
in the car.

331
00:07:42,508 --> 00:07:44,010
Cool. Can I see it?

332
00:07:44,051 --> 00:07:45,177
Hmm? Sure.

333
00:07:46,178 --> 00:07:47,596
Oh. Interesting.

334
00:07:47,638 --> 00:07:50,057
I think this is one of those

335
00:07:47,638 --> 00:07:50,057
disappearing whistles.

336
00:07:50,099 --> 00:07:52,143
What are you

337
00:07:50,099 --> 00:07:52,143
talking about?

338
00:07:52,184 --> 00:07:53,352
(claps hands)

339
00:07:53,393 --> 00:07:54,812
Voila!

340
00:07:54,854 --> 00:07:57,189
Amazing.

341
00:07:57,230 --> 00:08:00,026
Where did it go?

342
00:08:00,067 --> 00:08:02,069
Look in your pocket.

343
00:08:02,987 --> 00:08:04,404
(gasping):

344
00:08:02,987 --> 00:08:04,404
Oh! Oh!

345
00:08:04,446 --> 00:08:07,199
Oh, how did you do that?

346
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:11,871
Sorry, a magician

347
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:11,871
never shares his secrets.

348
00:08:11,912 --> 00:08:13,039
I'll give you

349
00:08:11,912 --> 00:08:13,039
a hundred bucks.

350
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:14,665
Sold!

351
00:08:14,707 --> 00:08:15,749
Okay.

352
00:08:15,791 --> 00:08:17,292
Hey.

353
00:08:17,334 --> 00:08:19,753
Where's my wallet?

354
00:08:17,334 --> 00:08:19,753
Voila!

355
00:08:22,882 --> 00:08:25,134
Hey, Penny.

356
00:08:22,882 --> 00:08:25,134
I need your help.

357
00:08:25,176 --> 00:08:27,136
I am freaking out.

358
00:08:27,178 --> 00:08:28,303
Okay, is she there yet?

359
00:08:28,345 --> 00:08:30,430
No, I got here first.

360
00:08:28,345 --> 00:08:30,430
You know...

361
00:08:30,472 --> 00:08:33,225
get the lay of the land.

362
00:08:33,266 --> 00:08:35,019
Raj, it's gonna be okay.

363
00:08:33,266 --> 00:08:35,019
Look, sex isn't

364
00:08:35,061 --> 00:08:36,854
the most important thing

365
00:08:35,061 --> 00:08:36,854
in a relationship.

366
00:08:36,896 --> 00:08:40,983
My first time with Leonard

367
00:08:36,896 --> 00:08:40,983
was nothing to write home about.

368
00:08:41,025 --> 00:08:42,317
Really?

369
00:08:42,359 --> 00:08:44,195
Yeah, but, you know,

370
00:08:42,359 --> 00:08:44,195
over time it got better.

371
00:08:44,236 --> 00:08:45,821
S-So practice makes perfect?

372
00:08:45,863 --> 00:08:48,741
Well, practice makes better.

373
00:08:48,782 --> 00:08:51,077
(phone chimes)

374
00:08:51,118 --> 00:08:54,205
Oh, my God, oh, my God, she just

375
00:08:51,118 --> 00:08:54,205
texted. She's on her way up!

376
00:08:54,246 --> 00:08:55,915
Raj, calm down.

377
00:08:54,246 --> 00:08:55,915
You got this.

378
00:08:55,956 --> 00:08:58,250
Yes. Thank you, thank you.

379
00:08:55,956 --> 00:08:58,250
I got this.

380
00:08:58,291 --> 00:09:00,335
Just remember, the most

381
00:08:58,291 --> 00:09:00,335
important thing is to have fun.

382
00:09:00,377 --> 00:09:02,838
Stop putting

383
00:09:00,377 --> 00:09:02,838
so much pressure on me!

384
00:09:05,799 --> 00:09:07,927
Hi.

385
00:09:17,644 --> 00:09:19,897
Everything okay?

386
00:09:24,317 --> 00:09:26,737
Why are you acting

387
00:09:24,317 --> 00:09:26,737
so weird?

388
00:09:29,907 --> 00:09:32,076
Raj? What's going on?

389
00:09:32,118 --> 00:09:33,535
(champagne cork pops)

390
00:09:33,577 --> 00:09:36,914
Be right out!

391
00:09:33,577 --> 00:09:36,914
You look beautiful!

392
00:09:42,419 --> 00:09:45,756
Sorry, I had to use

393
00:09:42,419 --> 00:09:45,756
the facilities.

394
00:09:46,799 --> 00:09:49,051
With a bottle of champagne?

395
00:09:49,093 --> 00:09:51,595
Mm, I like to celebrate

396
00:09:49,093 --> 00:09:51,595
the little things in life.

397
00:09:52,763 --> 00:09:55,432
You need to go?

398
00:09:52,763 --> 00:09:55,432
There's still some left.

399
00:09:56,934 --> 00:09:59,895
Raj, what is going on?

400
00:09:56,934 --> 00:09:59,895
No, no, it's not

401
00:09:56,934 --> 00:09:59,895
what's going on,

402
00:09:59,937 --> 00:10:01,688
it's what's comin' off.

403
00:10:01,730 --> 00:10:03,107
Stop it.

404
00:10:03,149 --> 00:10:06,235
You're acting weird,

405
00:10:03,149 --> 00:10:06,235
and it's freaking me out.

406
00:10:06,277 --> 00:10:08,779
Why? Because I couldn't talk

407
00:10:06,277 --> 00:10:08,779
and ran in the bathroom

408
00:10:08,821 --> 00:10:10,739
to slug back a

409
00:10:08,821 --> 00:10:10,739
bottle of champagne

410
00:10:10,781 --> 00:10:12,992
when I pretended to pee?

411
00:10:13,033 --> 00:10:15,244
Okay, I think I'm gonna leave.

412
00:10:15,286 --> 00:10:17,704
No, no, wait, wait,

413
00:10:15,286 --> 00:10:17,704
don't— okay, don't go.

414
00:10:17,746 --> 00:10:20,082
Fine. Then tell me

415
00:10:17,746 --> 00:10:20,082
what's going on.

416
00:10:21,041 --> 00:10:23,043
Well, funny story...

417
00:10:23,085 --> 00:10:27,131
The truth.

418
00:10:23,085 --> 00:10:27,131
Oh, God, the truth is

419
00:10:23,085 --> 00:10:27,131
so not good for me!

420
00:10:30,134 --> 00:10:32,178
Voila.

421
00:10:32,219 --> 00:10:33,553
Darn it.

422
00:10:33,595 --> 00:10:34,763
It's okay.

423
00:10:34,805 --> 00:10:36,431
Here, let me

424
00:10:34,805 --> 00:10:36,431
show you again.

425
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:43,522
It's like you're

426
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:43,522
actually magic.

427
00:10:45,024 --> 00:10:48,777
You can do that but you still

428
00:10:45,024 --> 00:10:48,777
can't get my bra off.

429
00:10:50,154 --> 00:10:53,490
The rings don't roll

430
00:10:50,154 --> 00:10:53,490
their eyes at me.

431
00:10:53,532 --> 00:10:57,036
Excuse me, Turnip,

432
00:10:53,532 --> 00:10:57,036
we need to get going.

433
00:10:57,077 --> 00:11:00,331
But-but Howard was gonna show me

434
00:10:57,077 --> 00:11:00,331
some close-up magic.

435
00:11:00,372 --> 00:11:01,999
Well, if you want

436
00:11:00,372 --> 00:11:01,999
to see real magic,

437
00:11:02,041 --> 00:11:03,625
I'll take you

438
00:11:02,041 --> 00:11:03,625
to Union Station,

439
00:11:03,667 --> 00:11:05,669
home to trains, subways

440
00:11:03,667 --> 00:11:05,669
and busses that,

441
00:11:05,711 --> 00:11:09,131
every half hour— voila—

442
00:11:05,711 --> 00:11:09,131
drive to the airport.

443
00:11:09,173 --> 00:11:11,466
I'd like to stay,

444
00:11:09,173 --> 00:11:11,466
if you don't mind.

445
00:11:11,508 --> 00:11:12,843
Oh, not at all.

446
00:11:12,885 --> 00:11:15,804
Howard. A word.

447
00:11:17,306 --> 00:11:18,724
What's up?

448
00:11:18,765 --> 00:11:21,810
I need you to stop

449
00:11:18,765 --> 00:11:21,810
being so delightful.

450
00:11:18,765 --> 00:11:21,810
What?

451
00:11:21,852 --> 00:11:23,394
I'm supposed to be

452
00:11:21,852 --> 00:11:23,394
bonding with him.

453
00:11:23,436 --> 00:11:25,438
You have your own father-in-law;

454
00:11:23,436 --> 00:11:25,438
leave mine alone.

455
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:27,398
Tell you what, you take my

456
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:27,398
father-in-law, I'll take yours.

457
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,734
I don't want

458
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,734
your father-in-law.

459
00:11:28,775 --> 00:11:32,279
What if I throw in

460
00:11:28,775 --> 00:11:32,279
a quarter?

461
00:11:32,321 --> 00:11:34,823
Do it again.

462
00:11:32,321 --> 00:11:34,823
Do it again.

463
00:11:35,949 --> 00:11:39,452
Mrs. Fowler.

464
00:11:35,949 --> 00:11:39,452
Mrs. Fowler.

465
00:11:39,494 --> 00:11:41,580
Mrs. Fowler.

466
00:11:42,915 --> 00:11:44,415
Sheldon, what's going on?

467
00:11:44,457 --> 00:11:45,709
Where is Larry?

468
00:11:45,751 --> 00:11:48,712
Oh, Turnip's out;

469
00:11:45,751 --> 00:11:48,712
I'm bonding with you.

470
00:11:53,133 --> 00:11:56,345
Okay, you wanted the truth,

471
00:11:53,133 --> 00:11:56,345
here it is.

472
00:11:56,387 --> 00:11:57,763
You have a drinking problem.

473
00:11:59,098 --> 00:12:01,558
No. I, uh,

474
00:11:59,098 --> 00:12:01,558
I have a talking problem,

475
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:04,228
and a drinking solution.

476
00:12:04,270 --> 00:12:05,729
What does that mean?

477
00:12:05,771 --> 00:12:08,274
(sighs)

478
00:12:08,315 --> 00:12:11,735
Oh, Anu, for

479
00:12:08,315 --> 00:12:11,735
most of my life,

480
00:12:11,777 --> 00:12:13,779
I got so nervous

481
00:12:11,777 --> 00:12:13,779
around women

482
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:15,948
that I couldn't talk

483
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:15,948
to them without alcohol.

484
00:12:15,989 --> 00:12:18,909
So you've been drunk every time

485
00:12:15,989 --> 00:12:18,909
we've seen each other?

486
00:12:18,951 --> 00:12:20,786
No. No. It hasn't

487
00:12:18,951 --> 00:12:20,786
happened in a long time.

488
00:12:20,827 --> 00:12:22,371
And I really thought

489
00:12:20,827 --> 00:12:22,371
I was over it,

490
00:12:22,413 --> 00:12:25,416
but I guess...

491
00:12:22,413 --> 00:12:25,416
I-I don't know,

492
00:12:25,456 --> 00:12:28,001
I guess I-I wanted so much

493
00:12:25,456 --> 00:12:28,001
for tonight to go well,

494
00:12:28,043 --> 00:12:30,337
that I-I stressed

495
00:12:28,043 --> 00:12:30,337
myself out.

496
00:12:30,379 --> 00:12:31,880
It came back.

497
00:12:31,922 --> 00:12:33,757
(sighs)

498
00:12:33,799 --> 00:12:35,884
Why didn't you tell me

499
00:12:33,799 --> 00:12:35,884
about this before?

500
00:12:35,926 --> 00:12:38,678
I was embarrassed.

501
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,722
I get that.

502
00:12:42,933 --> 00:12:44,310
If it makes you

503
00:12:42,933 --> 00:12:44,310
feel any better,

504
00:12:44,351 --> 00:12:47,354
I've got things

505
00:12:44,351 --> 00:12:47,354
I'm embarrassed about, too.

506
00:12:47,396 --> 00:12:49,815
Really? Will you

507
00:12:47,396 --> 00:12:49,815
tell me one?

508
00:12:49,856 --> 00:12:52,776
Okay. Um...

509
00:12:52,818 --> 00:12:55,486
Ugh. I hate

510
00:12:52,818 --> 00:12:55,486
telling people this.

511
00:12:55,528 --> 00:12:59,283
I don't like music.

512
00:12:59,325 --> 00:13:01,994
What kind of music?

513
00:13:02,035 --> 00:13:04,704
Just all of it.

514
00:13:05,831 --> 00:13:08,499
It sort of seems

515
00:13:05,831 --> 00:13:08,499
like a waste of time.

516
00:13:08,541 --> 00:13:12,671
Even Beyoncé?

517
00:13:12,712 --> 00:13:14,214
See, this is why

518
00:13:12,712 --> 00:13:14,214
I don't tell people.

519
00:13:14,256 --> 00:13:15,924
No. Um, it's fine.

520
00:13:14,256 --> 00:13:15,924
It's just,

521
00:13:15,966 --> 00:13:19,970
have you heard

522
00:13:15,966 --> 00:13:19,970
"Single Ladies"?

523
00:13:20,012 --> 00:13:21,763
Yeah, and I don't get it.

524
00:13:21,805 --> 00:13:23,932
I mean, the lyrics are

525
00:13:21,805 --> 00:13:23,932
"Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh."

526
00:13:23,974 --> 00:13:27,686
Y-You have to sing it in

527
00:13:23,974 --> 00:13:27,686
the voice of a goddess.

528
00:13:27,727 --> 00:13:29,562
Like: * Oh, wa-ah, oh ♪

529
00:13:29,604 --> 00:13:31,023
♪ Wa-ah, oh ♪

530
00:13:31,064 --> 00:13:32,274
♪ Oh, oh, oh ♪

531
00:13:32,316 --> 00:13:34,901
♪ Wa-ah, oh. ♪

532
00:13:32,316 --> 00:13:34,901
(laughs)

533
00:13:34,943 --> 00:13:38,697
My point is, we both have

534
00:13:34,943 --> 00:13:38,697
our little eccentricities.

535
00:13:38,738 --> 00:13:40,573
Little eccentricities?

536
00:13:40,615 --> 00:13:43,452
One is a deep-seated

537
00:13:40,615 --> 00:13:43,452
psychological disturbance,

538
00:13:43,494 --> 00:13:45,996
and the other can be solved by

539
00:13:43,494 --> 00:13:45,996
half a glass of chardonnay.

540
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:53,337
So the doctor prescribed Nizoral

541
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:53,337
and it blocked enzyme action,

542
00:13:53,379 --> 00:13:56,923
and the fungus

543
00:13:53,379 --> 00:13:56,923
cleared right up.

544
00:13:56,965 --> 00:14:00,719
That's a very

545
00:13:56,965 --> 00:14:00,719
disturbing picture.

546
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:02,971
Yes, well, they say a picture's

547
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:02,971
worth a thousand words,

548
00:14:03,013 --> 00:14:05,932
but I say nothing beats a

549
00:14:03,013 --> 00:14:05,932
picture and a thousand words.

550
00:14:05,974 --> 00:14:10,521
Still, you might want

551
00:14:05,974 --> 00:14:10,521
to take it off Facebook.

552
00:14:10,561 --> 00:14:12,814
Oh, no. It's in my nature

553
00:14:10,561 --> 00:14:12,814
to share.

554
00:14:12,856 --> 00:14:15,734
So, your turn.

555
00:14:15,775 --> 00:14:17,444
Uh, other than Amy,

556
00:14:17,486 --> 00:14:21,490
have you every had anything

557
00:14:17,486 --> 00:14:21,490
removed from your body?

558
00:14:24,243 --> 00:14:27,246
I am not going to answer that.

559
00:14:27,287 --> 00:14:30,165
Smart. Save something for

560
00:14:27,287 --> 00:14:30,165
our next get-together.

561
00:14:30,207 --> 00:14:33,168
Oh, we should commemorate

562
00:14:30,207 --> 00:14:33,168
this one with a selfie.

563
00:14:36,255 --> 00:14:40,759
Oh, look at us,

564
00:14:36,255 --> 00:14:40,759
two peas in a pod.

565
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,344
Oh, speaking of vegetables,

566
00:14:42,386 --> 00:14:45,889
how about I start calling you

567
00:14:42,386 --> 00:14:45,889
Old Lady Green Beans?

568
00:14:50,561 --> 00:14:52,396
Hey, you look

569
00:14:50,561 --> 00:14:52,396
deep in thought.

570
00:14:52,438 --> 00:14:55,107
Ah, I'm just reflecting.

571
00:14:52,438 --> 00:14:55,107
About what?

572
00:14:55,148 --> 00:14:57,443
The first time

573
00:14:55,148 --> 00:14:57,443
we slept together.

574
00:14:57,484 --> 00:15:00,362
Oh, honey. Don't beat

575
00:14:57,484 --> 00:15:00,362
yourself up; it's great now.

576
00:15:02,697 --> 00:15:05,242
This is not good.

577
00:15:05,284 --> 00:15:06,577
Sheldon is hanging out

578
00:15:05,284 --> 00:15:06,577
with my mom.

579
00:15:06,618 --> 00:15:07,911
Yeah. O-One sec.

580
00:15:07,953 --> 00:15:10,622
W-What do you mean,

581
00:15:07,953 --> 00:15:10,622
"don't beat myself up"?

582
00:15:10,663 --> 00:15:12,749
AMY:

583
00:15:10,663 --> 00:15:12,749
Guys, focus.

584
00:15:12,791 --> 00:15:14,709
My mom thinks

585
00:15:12,791 --> 00:15:14,709
that Sheldon is the reason

586
00:15:14,751 --> 00:15:16,002
I don't spend a lot of time

587
00:15:14,751 --> 00:15:16,002
with her.

588
00:15:16,044 --> 00:15:17,463
Well, why would

589
00:15:16,044 --> 00:15:17,463
she think that?

590
00:15:17,504 --> 00:15:18,630
Because I told her.

591
00:15:18,671 --> 00:15:21,133
You need a cup of coffee?

592
00:15:18,671 --> 00:15:21,133
Wake up!

593
00:15:21,174 --> 00:15:23,635
So you've been using Sheldon

594
00:15:21,174 --> 00:15:23,635
as an excuse

595
00:15:23,676 --> 00:15:25,387
to get out of

596
00:15:23,676 --> 00:15:25,387
seeing your mother?

597
00:15:25,429 --> 00:15:27,139
(sighs) I know.

598
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:28,640
I feel terrible.

599
00:15:28,681 --> 00:15:31,226
I love my mom but,

600
00:15:28,681 --> 00:15:31,226
you know, sometimes...

601
00:15:31,268 --> 00:15:34,146
Yeah. We-We've met her. Yeah.

602
00:15:34,187 --> 00:15:36,898
And it's easier to say

603
00:15:34,187 --> 00:15:36,898
I can't spend time with her

604
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:41,069
because of Sheldon than to admit

605
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:41,069
that I just, I don't want to.

606
00:15:41,111 --> 00:15:42,779
Totally understandable.

607
00:15:42,821 --> 00:15:44,364
I'll ask again,

608
00:15:42,821 --> 00:15:44,364
what do you mean,

609
00:15:44,406 --> 00:15:46,408
"don't beat myself up"?

610
00:15:47,951 --> 00:15:50,579
And then you ask me 20

611
00:15:47,951 --> 00:15:50,579
questions to try to determine

612
00:15:50,621 --> 00:15:52,956
which Nobel Prize-winning

613
00:15:50,621 --> 00:15:52,956
physicist I am.

614
00:15:52,998 --> 00:15:54,666
Ready? Go.

615
00:15:58,128 --> 00:16:00,631
Can I give up?

616
00:16:00,672 --> 00:16:03,342
No. 19 questions left.

617
00:16:03,383 --> 00:16:05,469
(ringtone playing)

618
00:16:10,223 --> 00:16:11,558
Are you gonna get that?

619
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,602
Oh, no. We're in the

620
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,602
middle of a game.

621
00:16:15,728 --> 00:16:18,524
18 questions left.

622
00:16:20,066 --> 00:16:21,943
Answer the phone,

623
00:16:20,066 --> 00:16:21,943
Sheldon.

624
00:16:22,819 --> 00:16:24,737
Hello, Amy.

625
00:16:24,779 --> 00:16:26,490
Hey, how's it going?

626
00:16:26,532 --> 00:16:29,742
Well, Howard lured your dad away

627
00:16:26,532 --> 00:16:29,742
with magic,

628
00:16:29,784 --> 00:16:31,537
so now I'm bonding

629
00:16:29,784 --> 00:16:31,537
with your mom.

630
00:16:34,498 --> 00:16:36,708
I think she likes me.

631
00:16:38,918 --> 00:16:40,462
I'd like you a lot better

632
00:16:40,504 --> 00:16:42,797
if you weren't keeping

633
00:16:40,504 --> 00:16:42,797
my daughter away from me.

634
00:16:42,839 --> 00:16:44,132
Uh, wh— Hang on, Amy.

635
00:16:44,174 --> 00:16:46,968
What's the problem,

636
00:16:44,174 --> 00:16:46,968
Green Beans?

637
00:16:47,010 --> 00:16:50,347
Amy said she couldn't come

638
00:16:47,010 --> 00:16:50,347
to Thanksgiving dinner

639
00:16:50,389 --> 00:16:52,599
because you always have

640
00:16:50,389 --> 00:16:52,599
to spend it with your mother.

641
00:16:52,641 --> 00:16:55,227
I haven't spent Thanksgiving

642
00:16:52,641 --> 00:16:55,227
with my mother in years.

643
00:16:56,395 --> 00:16:57,812
Amy, why would you tell

644
00:16:56,395 --> 00:16:57,812
your mother

645
00:16:57,854 --> 00:16:59,481
that I spend Thanksgiving

646
00:16:57,854 --> 00:16:59,481
with my mother?

647
00:16:59,523 --> 00:17:02,317
Uh, no time

648
00:16:59,523 --> 00:17:02,317
to talk about that now.

649
00:17:02,359 --> 00:17:04,236
All your action figures

650
00:17:02,359 --> 00:17:04,236
are on fire.

651
00:17:04,277 --> 00:17:06,029
Harrison Ford's in the lobby.

652
00:17:04,277 --> 00:17:06,029
Come quick.

653
00:17:09,324 --> 00:17:10,867
And Amy never joins us

654
00:17:09,324 --> 00:17:10,867
for Sunday dinners

655
00:17:10,909 --> 00:17:12,994
because you refuse to go out

656
00:17:10,909 --> 00:17:12,994
on a school night.

657
00:17:13,036 --> 00:17:15,664
Sh— I can go out

658
00:17:13,036 --> 00:17:15,664
on a school night

659
00:17:15,706 --> 00:17:18,083
as long as I'm in

660
00:17:15,706 --> 00:17:18,083
my PJs by 10:00.

661
00:17:19,084 --> 00:17:20,419
Sheldon, don't listen to her.

662
00:17:20,460 --> 00:17:21,753
She doesn't know

663
00:17:20,460 --> 00:17:21,753
what she's talking about.

664
00:17:21,794 --> 00:17:24,756
She's crazy!

665
00:17:24,797 --> 00:17:26,717
Hello, Amy.

666
00:17:28,552 --> 00:17:29,928
Hello, Mother.

667
00:17:32,389 --> 00:17:36,768
Great news. We-we can come

668
00:17:32,389 --> 00:17:36,768
for Thanksgiving this year.

669
00:17:38,103 --> 00:17:40,063
I can't believe it.

670
00:17:40,105 --> 00:17:41,732
All this time

671
00:17:40,105 --> 00:17:41,732
I've been angry at you

672
00:17:41,773 --> 00:17:43,233
when I should have

673
00:17:41,773 --> 00:17:43,233
been angry at Amy.

674
00:17:43,275 --> 00:17:45,777
Look at that.

675
00:17:43,275 --> 00:17:45,777
We're both angry at Amy.

676
00:17:45,818 --> 00:17:48,697
Maybe that's something

677
00:17:45,818 --> 00:17:48,697
we could bond over.

678
00:17:49,698 --> 00:17:50,907
Let me ask you this:

679
00:17:50,949 --> 00:17:52,992
how do you feel about Howard?

680
00:17:53,034 --> 00:17:56,622
Oh, is he that odd little friend

681
00:17:53,034 --> 00:17:56,622
you have with the haircut?

682
00:17:56,663 --> 00:18:00,083
I may have married

683
00:17:56,663 --> 00:18:00,083
the wrong Fowler.

684
00:18:02,461 --> 00:18:06,005
Why would Amy feel

685
00:18:02,461 --> 00:18:06,005
the need to lie to me?

686
00:18:06,047 --> 00:18:07,424
Well, perhaps because

687
00:18:06,047 --> 00:18:07,424
you're her mother

688
00:18:07,466 --> 00:18:09,092
and she didn't want

689
00:18:07,466 --> 00:18:09,092
to disappoint you.

690
00:18:09,134 --> 00:18:11,010
Really?

691
00:18:11,052 --> 00:18:13,096
Even after she threw you

692
00:18:11,052 --> 00:18:13,096
under the bus,

693
00:18:13,138 --> 00:18:14,806
you're still

694
00:18:13,138 --> 00:18:14,806
gonna defend her.

695
00:18:14,847 --> 00:18:16,182
Oh, yes.

696
00:18:16,224 --> 00:18:17,934
She's my wife

697
00:18:16,224 --> 00:18:17,934
and I love her.

698
00:18:17,976 --> 00:18:20,145
And if I can forgive her for

699
00:18:17,976 --> 00:18:20,145
putting ketchup on her eggs,

700
00:18:20,186 --> 00:18:22,439
I can forgive her for this.

701
00:18:22,481 --> 00:18:26,192
Her father does that,

702
00:18:22,481 --> 00:18:26,192
it's disgusting.

703
00:18:26,234 --> 00:18:29,613
Amy's crazy,

704
00:18:26,234 --> 00:18:29,613
you are a delight.

705
00:18:37,954 --> 00:18:39,706
Good morning.

706
00:18:39,748 --> 00:18:41,416
Mm. Good morning.

707
00:18:41,458 --> 00:18:42,793
I ordered some coffee for us.

708
00:18:42,834 --> 00:18:45,671
Oh, fantastic.

709
00:18:45,712 --> 00:18:47,339
(sighs)

710
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:49,090
Last night was...

711
00:18:49,132 --> 00:18:50,925
wonderful.

712
00:18:52,469 --> 00:18:54,429
(sighs) But all we

713
00:18:52,469 --> 00:18:54,429
did was talk.

714
00:18:54,471 --> 00:18:56,973
Yeah. And it was wonderful.

715
00:18:57,015 --> 00:18:59,184
Am I safe to assume

716
00:18:57,015 --> 00:18:59,184
you talking to me now

717
00:18:59,225 --> 00:19:01,186
is a good sign

718
00:18:59,225 --> 00:19:01,186
for our marriage?

719
00:19:01,227 --> 00:19:03,772
(chuckles) Yeah,

720
00:19:01,227 --> 00:19:03,772
and-and for my liver.

721
00:19:05,398 --> 00:19:06,983
Hey, about the other thing.

722
00:19:07,025 --> 00:19:08,777
Um...

723
00:19:08,819 --> 00:19:11,279
Should we just wait

724
00:19:08,819 --> 00:19:11,279
for another night?

725
00:19:12,698 --> 00:19:15,742
Or I go take a shower,

726
00:19:15,784 --> 00:19:18,286
and you decide how

727
00:19:15,784 --> 00:19:18,286
you want to play this.

728
00:19:24,083 --> 00:19:26,503
Take a shower with me, Raj.

729
00:19:32,718 --> 00:19:34,135
Thank you, Amy.

730
00:19:34,177 --> 00:19:35,804
It's so nice of you

731
00:19:34,177 --> 00:19:35,804
to have us over for dinner.

732
00:19:35,846 --> 00:19:40,016
(chuckles) Couldn't think

733
00:19:35,846 --> 00:19:40,016
of a single reason not to.

734
00:19:40,058 --> 00:19:42,394
Yeah, and boy,

735
00:19:40,058 --> 00:19:42,394
did she try.

736
00:19:42,435 --> 00:19:44,354
Thank you, honey.

737
00:19:44,396 --> 00:19:46,981
Oh, you're welcome, dear.

738
00:19:47,023 --> 00:19:49,568
Would anyone like to see the

739
00:19:47,023 --> 00:19:49,568
magic trick Howard taught me?

740
00:19:49,609 --> 00:19:52,320
I'd love to see your trick,

741
00:19:49,609 --> 00:19:52,320
Daddy.

742
00:19:55,448 --> 00:19:58,744
A perfectly ordinary

743
00:19:55,448 --> 00:19:58,744
table knife.

744
00:19:58,785 --> 00:20:00,412
(exhales)

745
00:20:02,789 --> 00:20:04,916
Watch closely.

746
00:20:04,957 --> 00:20:07,085
Voila.

747
00:20:07,126 --> 00:20:10,547
Oh, my gosh,

748
00:20:07,126 --> 00:20:10,547
that was so good.

749
00:20:16,177 --> 00:20:19,055
Well, look,

750
00:20:16,177 --> 00:20:19,055
there's fake blood, too.

751
00:20:20,891 --> 00:20:22,517
I'll be right back.

752
00:20:26,979 --> 00:20:29,524
I don't know about you,

753
00:20:26,979 --> 00:20:29,524
but I don't really like magic.

754
00:20:29,566 --> 00:20:33,904
You just keep getting

755
00:20:29,566 --> 00:20:33,904
better and better.
