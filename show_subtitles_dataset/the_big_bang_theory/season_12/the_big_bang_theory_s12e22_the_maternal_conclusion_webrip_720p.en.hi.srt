1
00:00:09,295 --> 00:00:10,463
Leonard, when are you leaving

2
00:00:10,505 --> 00:00:11,881
to pick your mother up

3
00:00:10,505 --> 00:00:11,881
from the airport?

4
00:00:11,922 --> 00:00:14,425
Uh, well, let's see, her

5
00:00:11,922 --> 00:00:14,425
plane gets in at 3:00,

6
00:00:14,467 --> 00:00:18,596
figure half an hour to get

7
00:00:14,467 --> 00:00:18,596
her luggage, so... never.

8
00:00:18,638 --> 00:00:20,306
Never?

9
00:00:20,348 --> 00:00:23,767
Isn't that usually

10
00:00:20,348 --> 00:00:23,767
when you go to the gym?

11
00:00:23,809 --> 00:00:26,187
Are you really not gonna

12
00:00:23,809 --> 00:00:26,187
pick up your mother?

13
00:00:26,229 --> 00:00:28,398
No— it's fine, she likes

14
00:00:26,229 --> 00:00:28,398
to take a cab or a shuttle.

15
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:30,191
That way she can meet people.

16
00:00:30,233 --> 00:00:31,609
Well, that's kind of nice.

17
00:00:31,651 --> 00:00:33,403
Yeah, she always says

18
00:00:31,651 --> 00:00:33,403
that a stranger is just

19
00:00:33,444 --> 00:00:37,031
a person whose emotional weak

20
00:00:33,444 --> 00:00:37,031
point you haven't found yet.

21
00:00:38,115 --> 00:00:40,660
Your mom is the best.

22
00:00:38,115 --> 00:00:40,660
(chuckles)

23
00:00:40,702 --> 00:00:42,203
Oh, maybe I should pick her up.

24
00:00:42,245 --> 00:00:43,496
You don't drive.

25
00:00:43,538 --> 00:00:45,164
That's what makes you

26
00:00:43,538 --> 00:00:45,164
and me a great team.

27
00:00:45,206 --> 00:00:46,416
Go get your keys.

28
00:00:47,709 --> 00:00:48,876
You can't pick her up.

29
00:00:48,918 --> 00:00:50,127
It'll make me

30
00:00:48,918 --> 00:00:50,127
look like a bad son.

31
00:00:50,169 --> 00:00:51,546
I imagine that's

32
00:00:50,169 --> 00:00:51,546
one of the things

33
00:00:51,588 --> 00:00:52,838
we'll talk about

34
00:00:51,588 --> 00:00:52,838
on the ride.

35
00:00:53,923 --> 00:00:55,841
That and Amy's

36
00:00:53,923 --> 00:00:55,841
recent reluctance

37
00:00:55,883 --> 00:00:57,051
to use turn signals.

38
00:00:57,093 --> 00:01:00,304
We were in a parking garage.

39
00:01:00,346 --> 00:01:01,805
Come on,

40
00:01:00,346 --> 00:01:01,805
she gave birth to you.

41
00:01:01,847 --> 00:01:03,015
Fine, I'll pick her up.

42
00:01:03,057 --> 00:01:04,267
Good, I'll go with you.

43
00:01:04,308 --> 00:01:05,768
I call back seat.

44
00:01:04,308 --> 00:01:05,768
Oh, I don't want to be

45
00:01:05,809 --> 00:01:07,478
the only one who doesn't go.

46
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:09,689
I'll just sit here afraid that

47
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:09,689
you're all talking about me.

48
00:01:09,731 --> 00:01:11,023
We're not gonna

49
00:01:09,731 --> 00:01:11,023
talk about you.

50
00:01:11,065 --> 00:01:13,276
Well, that's my other fear.

51
00:01:13,317 --> 00:01:16,613
This is crazy. I can

52
00:01:13,317 --> 00:01:16,613
pick her up by myself.

53
00:01:19,490 --> 00:01:21,492

There were some parents

70
00:01:51,021 --> 00:01:52,898
with a baby.

71
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:54,191
A lot of crying.

72
00:01:54,233 --> 00:01:56,026
Well, babies do that.

73
00:01:56,068 --> 00:01:57,612
No, it was the parents.

74
00:01:59,238 --> 00:02:02,366
It seems they couldn't handle

75
00:01:59,238 --> 00:02:02,366
some constructive criticism.

76
00:02:04,285 --> 00:02:06,996
Hey, on a completely

77
00:02:04,285 --> 00:02:06,996
unrelated note, um,

78
00:02:07,037 --> 00:02:08,914
you know, if you'd

79
00:02:07,037 --> 00:02:08,914
rather stay at a hotel,

80
00:02:08,956 --> 00:02:10,458
we wouldn't be offended.

81
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:13,670
Actually, I've been looking

82
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:13,670
forward to staying with you.

83
00:02:13,711 --> 00:02:17,047
Really? It's just, normally,

84
00:02:13,711 --> 00:02:17,047
you stay at a hotel.

85
00:02:17,089 --> 00:02:20,301
Would you like me

86
00:02:17,089 --> 00:02:20,301
to stay at a hotel?

87
00:02:17,089 --> 00:02:20,301
No, no, no.

88
00:02:20,343 --> 00:02:23,137
I-I invited you to stay with us.

89
00:02:23,179 --> 00:02:24,722
And I accepted,

90
00:02:24,764 --> 00:02:26,724
so everyone is happy.

91
00:02:26,766 --> 00:02:28,685
Yep.

92
00:02:28,726 --> 00:02:31,395
I'm happy, you're happy...

93
00:02:32,396 --> 00:02:35,858
everyone's happy.

94
00:02:37,109 --> 00:02:39,612
How come we never eat

95
00:02:37,109 --> 00:02:39,612
in the dining room?

96
00:02:39,654 --> 00:02:40,780
Oh, that's for company.

97
00:02:43,949 --> 00:02:45,827
What am I?

98
00:02:45,868 --> 00:02:48,538
Apparently, a guy who wants

99
00:02:45,868 --> 00:02:48,538
to have his feelings hurt.

100
00:02:49,913 --> 00:02:51,833
When does Anu

101
00:02:49,913 --> 00:02:51,833
come back from London?

102
00:02:51,874 --> 00:02:54,001
Next week.

103
00:02:51,874 --> 00:02:54,001
But it's been good, you know?

104
00:02:54,043 --> 00:02:57,004
Really given me a chance

105
00:02:54,043 --> 00:02:57,004
to focus on myself.

106
00:02:57,046 --> 00:02:58,673
How's that going?

107
00:02:58,715 --> 00:03:01,342
I didn't like what I saw,

108
00:02:58,715 --> 00:03:01,342
got in my car, drove over here.

109
00:03:02,176 --> 00:03:03,927
Hey, guys.

110
00:03:02,176 --> 00:03:03,927
Hey.

111
00:03:02,176 --> 00:03:03,927
Hey.

112
00:03:03,969 --> 00:03:05,429
I'm sorry,

113
00:03:03,969 --> 00:03:05,429
I didn't know you had company.

114
00:03:05,471 --> 00:03:08,224
It's all right,

115
00:03:05,471 --> 00:03:08,224
neither did they.

116
00:03:08,265 --> 00:03:09,767
Is Stuart home?

117
00:03:09,809 --> 00:03:11,185
No, he's at work.

118
00:03:11,227 --> 00:03:13,604
The last juice.

119
00:03:11,227 --> 00:03:13,604
I'm gonna add it to the list.

120
00:03:21,945 --> 00:03:23,698
That's whose handwriting

121
00:03:21,945 --> 00:03:23,698
that is.

122
00:03:25,032 --> 00:03:27,284
I've noticed she's been

123
00:03:25,032 --> 00:03:27,284
over here a lot lately.

124
00:03:27,326 --> 00:03:28,578
You know how you noticed that?

125
00:03:28,619 --> 00:03:31,163
Because you're over

126
00:03:28,619 --> 00:03:31,163
here a lot lately.

127
00:03:31,205 --> 00:03:33,583
She has slept over

128
00:03:31,205 --> 00:03:33,583
every night this week.

129
00:03:33,624 --> 00:03:35,376
Uh, no, no,

130
00:03:33,624 --> 00:03:35,376
she wasn't here Wednesday night.

131
00:03:35,418 --> 00:03:37,211
Yes, she was. You didn't notice

132
00:03:35,418 --> 00:03:37,211
because you were in the hot tub

133
00:03:37,253 --> 00:03:39,213
in the backyard eating Oreos.

134
00:03:39,255 --> 00:03:42,091
That reminds me.

135
00:03:44,218 --> 00:03:46,387
Oreos.

136
00:03:47,722 --> 00:03:49,348
Really?

137
00:03:49,390 --> 00:03:51,225
A photon entanglement team.

138
00:03:51,267 --> 00:03:53,269
Yeah, I-I'm actually

139
00:03:51,267 --> 00:03:53,269
the colead.

140
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:55,438
Yeah, if you like photons

141
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:55,438
and how they get entangled,

142
00:03:55,479 --> 00:03:57,648
he's your co-guy.

143
00:03:55,479 --> 00:03:57,648
(Leonard chuckles)

144
00:03:57,690 --> 00:04:00,276
I would enjoy

145
00:03:57,690 --> 00:04:00,276
seeing your lab.

146
00:04:01,318 --> 00:04:03,237
Oh. Yeah, sure.

147
00:04:03,279 --> 00:04:05,197
Uh, if you want,

148
00:04:03,279 --> 00:04:05,197
you can come tomorrow.

149
00:04:05,239 --> 00:04:06,616
I look forward to it.

150
00:04:06,657 --> 00:04:08,409
Well, I think

151
00:04:06,657 --> 00:04:08,409
I'm going to turn in.

152
00:04:08,451 --> 00:04:09,619
Good night, Penny.

153
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:10,912
Good night, dear.

154
00:04:10,953 --> 00:04:13,330
Good night.

155
00:04:10,953 --> 00:04:13,330
Night, Beverly.

156
00:04:13,372 --> 00:04:16,292
Wow, she's being really nice.

157
00:04:16,333 --> 00:04:18,210
Yeah, clearly,

158
00:04:16,333 --> 00:04:18,210
one of us is dying.

159
00:04:20,129 --> 00:04:21,297
Come on, her.

160
00:04:22,423 --> 00:04:24,550
Or you accomplished

161
00:04:22,423 --> 00:04:24,550
something great,

162
00:04:24,592 --> 00:04:26,051
and she's genuinely proud.

163
00:04:26,093 --> 00:04:28,471
Yeah, all right,

164
00:04:26,093 --> 00:04:28,471
you've had enough.

165
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:33,016
(keyboard clicks)

166
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:33,016
Hi.

167
00:04:33,058 --> 00:04:34,602
Hey.

168
00:04:33,058 --> 00:04:34,602
Oh, it's so good

169
00:04:34,644 --> 00:04:36,186
to see your face.

170
00:04:36,228 --> 00:04:37,855
H-How's the concierge

171
00:04:36,228 --> 00:04:37,855
conference?

172
00:04:37,897 --> 00:04:39,690
You guys just get

173
00:04:37,897 --> 00:04:39,690
theater tickets

174
00:04:39,732 --> 00:04:40,900
for each other all day long?

175
00:04:40,942 --> 00:04:43,820
(chuckles)

176
00:04:40,942 --> 00:04:43,820
It's going great,

177
00:04:43,861 --> 00:04:46,363
and the company put me

178
00:04:43,861 --> 00:04:46,363
in a nice place in Notting Hill.

179
00:04:46,405 --> 00:04:48,783
Notting Hill? Like the movie?

180
00:04:48,825 --> 00:04:52,745
Uh, "I'm just a boy standing

181
00:04:48,825 --> 00:04:52,745
in front of a girl saying..."

182
00:04:52,787 --> 00:04:55,247
you better bring me home

183
00:04:52,787 --> 00:04:55,247
a T-shirt.

184
00:04:56,373 --> 00:04:57,917
I can't wait for you

185
00:04:56,373 --> 00:04:57,917
to come home.

186
00:04:57,959 --> 00:05:01,921
Actually, that's one

187
00:04:57,959 --> 00:05:01,921
of the reasons I called.

188
00:05:01,963 --> 00:05:04,548
They offered me

189
00:05:01,963 --> 00:05:04,548
a management position.

190
00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:07,176
That's amazing.

191
00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:07,176
T-That's your dream.

192
00:05:07,217 --> 00:05:09,261
It's here in London.

193
00:05:09,303 --> 00:05:11,388
Oh.

194
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:14,892
And they want me

195
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:14,892
to start right away.

196
00:05:14,934 --> 00:05:17,311
What does that mean for us?

197
00:05:17,353 --> 00:05:20,982
Well, how committed are you

198
00:05:17,353 --> 00:05:20,982
to staying in California?

199
00:05:21,064 --> 00:05:24,819
This is where my work is,

200
00:05:21,064 --> 00:05:24,819
this is where my friends are.

201
00:05:24,861 --> 00:05:26,195
But are you happy?

202
00:05:26,236 --> 00:05:28,739
Not for years.

203
00:05:26,236 --> 00:05:28,739
What's your point?

204
00:05:31,241 --> 00:05:34,829
All right, I got to head

205
00:05:31,241 --> 00:05:34,829
out to my drawing class.

206
00:05:34,871 --> 00:05:36,372
Fruit or naked dudes?

207
00:05:37,790 --> 00:05:39,750
Actually, it doesn't matter,

208
00:05:37,790 --> 00:05:39,750
I'm jealous of both.

209
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:43,045
I'll see you tonight?

210
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:43,045
Yeah.

211
00:05:44,005 --> 00:05:45,798
(laughs softly)

212
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,341
So she's coming over again, huh?

213
00:05:47,383 --> 00:05:49,844
Yeah, we're gonna

214
00:05:47,383 --> 00:05:49,844
do a movie night.

215
00:05:49,886 --> 00:05:53,723
It's my house. Don't you think

216
00:05:49,886 --> 00:05:53,723
you should ask me?

217
00:05:53,764 --> 00:05:55,725
You're right, I'm sorry.

218
00:05:55,766 --> 00:05:59,395
Howard, would you like

219
00:05:55,766 --> 00:05:59,395
to come to movie night?

220
00:06:00,563 --> 00:06:02,272
Doesn't she have her own place?

221
00:06:02,314 --> 00:06:03,816
Why don't you guys

222
00:06:02,314 --> 00:06:03,816
hang out there?

223
00:06:03,858 --> 00:06:05,359
Oh, she has

224
00:06:03,858 --> 00:06:05,359
a roommate,

225
00:06:05,401 --> 00:06:07,945
and he's kind of creepy.

226
00:06:07,987 --> 00:06:11,365
A-And that's coming from me.

227
00:06:11,407 --> 00:06:14,994
It just feels like Denise

228
00:06:11,407 --> 00:06:14,994
is basically living with us.

229
00:06:15,036 --> 00:06:17,914
You know, maybe you can spend

230
00:06:15,036 --> 00:06:17,914
half the time at her place.

231
00:06:17,955 --> 00:06:20,499
Hey, when I moved in, you

232
00:06:17,955 --> 00:06:20,499
and Bernadette said it was okay

233
00:06:20,541 --> 00:06:22,043
if I brought girls over.

234
00:06:22,083 --> 00:06:25,254
(laughs):

235
00:06:22,083 --> 00:06:25,254
Oh. We were making fun of you.

236
00:06:29,008 --> 00:06:32,511
And this is a high-pulse laser

237
00:06:29,008 --> 00:06:32,511
with a BBO crystal.

238
00:06:32,553 --> 00:06:33,971
It's pretty cool.

239
00:06:34,013 --> 00:06:36,766
It emits photons

240
00:06:34,013 --> 00:06:36,766
in discrete bursts.

241
00:06:36,807 --> 00:06:39,643
Huh. Very impressive.

242
00:06:39,685 --> 00:06:42,563
But...?

243
00:06:43,564 --> 00:06:44,899
But what, dear?

244
00:06:44,941 --> 00:06:46,358
Oh, I don't know.

245
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,652
It's just,

246
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,652
usually there's a "but"

247
00:06:48,694 --> 00:06:52,823
followed by something

248
00:06:48,694 --> 00:06:52,823
that makes me feel bad.

249
00:06:52,865 --> 00:06:54,283
Ah, Beverly, there you are.

250
00:06:54,324 --> 00:06:56,493
Sheldon, how nice to see you.

251
00:06:56,535 --> 00:06:58,788
Leonard was just

252
00:06:56,535 --> 00:06:58,788
showing me his new lab.

253
00:06:58,829 --> 00:07:00,873
Oh, yes, experimental physics,

254
00:07:00,915 --> 00:07:03,667
the carpentry

255
00:07:00,915 --> 00:07:03,667
of the science world. Well...

256
00:07:04,961 --> 00:07:07,504
I'm here to rescue you

257
00:07:04,961 --> 00:07:07,504
from the boredom.

258
00:07:07,546 --> 00:07:10,215
Not necessary. This is

259
00:07:07,546 --> 00:07:10,215
really quite interesting.

260
00:07:10,257 --> 00:07:12,885
But...?

261
00:07:12,927 --> 00:07:14,804
But nothing.

262
00:07:14,845 --> 00:07:18,015
Oh. Well, if you want to see

263
00:07:14,845 --> 00:07:18,015
something really interesting,

264
00:07:18,057 --> 00:07:19,475
I could show you my work,

265
00:07:19,516 --> 00:07:21,769
which is being talked about

266
00:07:19,516 --> 00:07:21,769
for a Nobel Prize.

267
00:07:21,811 --> 00:07:23,395
Oh, well,

268
00:07:21,811 --> 00:07:23,395
I'd love to see it later,

269
00:07:23,437 --> 00:07:25,481
but right now,

270
00:07:23,437 --> 00:07:25,481
I'm spending time with my son.

271
00:07:25,522 --> 00:07:28,442
Ha! I knew there was

272
00:07:25,522 --> 00:07:28,442
a "but"-- wait, what?

273
00:07:30,736 --> 00:07:32,154
Ready?

274
00:07:32,195 --> 00:07:34,865
You sure I didn't need

275
00:07:32,195 --> 00:07:34,865
to see Paddington 1?

276
00:07:34,907 --> 00:07:36,659
He's a bear, he talks,

277
00:07:34,907 --> 00:07:36,659
no one knows why.

278
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:37,994
You're all caught up.

279
00:07:38,035 --> 00:07:40,079
Push play.

280
00:07:40,121 --> 00:07:42,498
May I join you?

281
00:07:44,792 --> 00:07:48,211
Oh. Hey, Mitch,

282
00:07:44,792 --> 00:07:48,211
I didn't see you there.

283
00:07:48,253 --> 00:07:52,466
Really? I've been standing here

284
00:07:48,253 --> 00:07:52,466
the whole time.

285
00:07:53,425 --> 00:07:55,845
Well, sure. Yeah, join us.

286
00:07:58,597 --> 00:08:01,017
(exhales)

287
00:08:01,058 --> 00:08:03,144
(music playing softly over TV)

288
00:08:06,605 --> 00:08:07,898
Movie's up there.

289
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:09,358
I've seen it.

290
00:08:11,652 --> 00:08:13,696
It's wonderful.

291
00:08:18,701 --> 00:08:20,327
So she's staying in London?

292
00:08:20,369 --> 00:08:22,079
What does that mean

293
00:08:20,369 --> 00:08:22,079
for your relationship?

294
00:08:22,121 --> 00:08:23,580
It's great.

295
00:08:23,622 --> 00:08:26,249
I can see why she would

296
00:08:23,622 --> 00:08:26,249
say that, but why do you?

297
00:08:26,291 --> 00:08:28,585
Well, we got into this

298
00:08:26,291 --> 00:08:28,585
because we both wanted

299
00:08:28,627 --> 00:08:31,213
to get married, and honestly,

300
00:08:28,627 --> 00:08:31,213
we've been dragging our feet,

301
00:08:31,254 --> 00:08:34,008
and I think this

302
00:08:31,254 --> 00:08:34,008
is the push that we need.

303
00:08:34,050 --> 00:08:36,844
Wait, so you're gonna

304
00:08:34,050 --> 00:08:36,844
ask her to marry you?

305
00:08:36,886 --> 00:08:38,261
Why not?

306
00:08:38,303 --> 00:08:39,889
We like each

307
00:08:38,303 --> 00:08:39,889
other, plus,

308
00:08:39,930 --> 00:08:41,348
we both want to start a family.

309
00:08:41,390 --> 00:08:42,933
Hey, I can work from anywhere,

310
00:08:41,390 --> 00:08:42,933
I'm an astronomer.

311
00:08:42,975 --> 00:08:44,351
They have stars in London,

312
00:08:44,393 --> 00:08:47,229
and I'm not just talking

313
00:08:44,393 --> 00:08:47,229
about Dame Judi Dench.

314
00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:49,023
No one thought you were.

315
00:08:49,065 --> 00:08:50,566
I thought he was.

316
00:08:52,109 --> 00:08:55,071
So you're really gonna move

317
00:08:52,109 --> 00:08:55,071
halfway across the world?

318
00:08:56,030 --> 00:08:58,032
If she says yes,

319
00:08:58,074 --> 00:09:02,203
and if that's what

320
00:08:58,074 --> 00:09:02,203
she wants to do, then yeah.

321
00:09:02,244 --> 00:09:03,620
Wow.

322
00:09:03,662 --> 00:09:05,455
Yeah, I know.

323
00:09:03,662 --> 00:09:05,455
I'm flying out tomorrow.

324
00:09:05,497 --> 00:09:07,332
I'm gonna surprise her

325
00:09:05,497 --> 00:09:07,332
with a ring.

326
00:09:07,374 --> 00:09:11,045
You already have a ring?

327
00:09:07,374 --> 00:09:11,045
Well, it's the

328
00:09:07,374 --> 00:09:11,045
same one as before.

329
00:09:11,087 --> 00:09:13,714
I thought you gave it to her

330
00:09:11,087 --> 00:09:13,714
the first time you got engaged?

331
00:09:13,756 --> 00:09:14,965
I did, but I took it back.

332
00:09:17,009 --> 00:09:20,930
So, you're an Indian giver?

333
00:09:23,807 --> 00:09:25,768
Howie.

334
00:09:23,807 --> 00:09:25,768
What? If he's gonna

335
00:09:23,807 --> 00:09:25,768
move to England,

336
00:09:25,809 --> 00:09:27,937
I need to get all

337
00:09:25,809 --> 00:09:27,937
these out now.

338
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,942
Here you go.

339
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,942
Light cream, no sugar.

340
00:09:32,983 --> 00:09:34,235
That's perfect, thank you.

341
00:09:34,276 --> 00:09:36,028
Beverly, I have to

342
00:09:34,276 --> 00:09:36,028
say, it's so nice

343
00:09:36,070 --> 00:09:38,030
seeing the two of you get along.

344
00:09:38,072 --> 00:09:39,740
Oh, I've always

345
00:09:38,072 --> 00:09:39,740
gotten along with Leonard.

346
00:09:39,782 --> 00:09:44,327
Of all of my children,

347
00:09:39,782 --> 00:09:44,327
he's the most docile.

348
00:09:44,369 --> 00:09:46,496
She wrote that

349
00:09:44,369 --> 00:09:46,496
in a birthday card once.

350
00:09:46,538 --> 00:09:48,958
I keep it in my nightstand.

351
00:09:46,538 --> 00:09:48,958
(chuckles)

352
00:09:48,999 --> 00:09:50,918
Still, it made him so happy

353
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:53,420
showing you around

354
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:53,420
his lab yesterday.

355
00:09:53,462 --> 00:09:55,338
Interesting.

356
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:57,758
Would you say that

357
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:57,758
that made him, uh,

358
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:59,260
much happier than usual,

359
00:09:59,301 --> 00:10:03,806
somewhat happier than usual

360
00:09:59,301 --> 00:10:03,806
or as happy as usual?

361
00:10:03,847 --> 00:10:05,599
Hmm, multiple choice.

362
00:10:05,641 --> 00:10:09,937
Um, I'm-a go with D:

363
00:10:05,641 --> 00:10:09,937
"that's a weird question."

364
00:10:10,854 --> 00:10:13,190
It made me

365
00:10:10,854 --> 00:10:13,190
really happy.

366
00:10:13,232 --> 00:10:16,944
We haven't always had

367
00:10:13,232 --> 00:10:16,944
the easiest relationship.

368
00:10:16,986 --> 00:10:18,862
But, well,

369
00:10:16,986 --> 00:10:18,862
looking back,

370
00:10:18,904 --> 00:10:21,115
I guess you were

371
00:10:18,904 --> 00:10:21,115
just trying to push me

372
00:10:21,157 --> 00:10:22,825
to be the best version

373
00:10:21,157 --> 00:10:22,825
of myself.

374
00:10:22,866 --> 00:10:25,035
So you would say that

375
00:10:22,866 --> 00:10:25,035
my parenting strategies,

376
00:10:25,077 --> 00:10:26,703
although difficult at times,

377
00:10:26,745 --> 00:10:29,748
directly contributed

378
00:10:26,745 --> 00:10:29,748
to your current success?

379
00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:31,917
Well, I may have had a little

380
00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:31,917
something to do with it.

381
00:10:31,959 --> 00:10:34,253
I mean, how often do you wear

382
00:10:31,959 --> 00:10:34,253
your superhero underwear now?

383
00:10:36,130 --> 00:10:38,257
Only Fridays

384
00:10:36,130 --> 00:10:38,257
and my birthday.

385
00:10:36,130 --> 00:10:38,257
Yeah, that was all me.

386
00:10:38,299 --> 00:10:39,549
That was me.

387
00:10:39,591 --> 00:10:40,968
Yeah, that's a fair point.

388
00:10:41,010 --> 00:10:43,220
I hadn't considered

389
00:10:41,010 --> 00:10:43,220
your influence.

390
00:10:43,262 --> 00:10:46,265
Perhaps tomorrow I could observe

391
00:10:43,262 --> 00:10:46,265
the two of you together?

392
00:10:46,307 --> 00:10:47,975
Uh, "observe"?

393
00:10:48,017 --> 00:10:49,852
(laughs)

394
00:10:48,017 --> 00:10:49,852
What is going on?

395
00:10:49,893 --> 00:10:52,021
I'm just visiting with my son

396
00:10:52,062 --> 00:10:54,439
and doing research

397
00:10:52,062 --> 00:10:54,439
for my book on how various

398
00:10:54,481 --> 00:10:58,360
parenting strategies affected

399
00:10:54,481 --> 00:10:58,360
my children as adults.

400
00:10:59,361 --> 00:11:01,071
This has all

401
00:10:59,361 --> 00:11:01,071
been work to you?

402
00:11:03,699 --> 00:11:07,161
Hanging out with me

403
00:11:03,699 --> 00:11:07,161
and coming to my lab, I...

404
00:11:07,203 --> 00:11:09,579
I thought we were enjoying

405
00:11:07,203 --> 00:11:09,579
each other's company,

406
00:11:09,621 --> 00:11:10,998
but it was just research.

407
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,542
I was enjoying it;

408
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,542
you know I love research.

409
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:17,713
I can't believe this.

410
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:22,176
What? You seem angry.

411
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:22,176
Of course I'm angry!

412
00:11:22,218 --> 00:11:25,512
Well, so would you say

413
00:11:22,218 --> 00:11:25,512
that you're somewhat angry,

414
00:11:25,554 --> 00:11:27,639
very angry or extremely angry?

415
00:11:27,681 --> 00:11:29,141
Never mind.

416
00:11:29,183 --> 00:11:31,434
I can see it in your face, dear.

417
00:11:35,272 --> 00:11:37,649
I'm looking over my

418
00:11:35,272 --> 00:11:37,649
text correspondence

419
00:11:37,691 --> 00:11:39,484
with Beverly and I

420
00:11:37,691 --> 00:11:39,484
don't see anything

421
00:11:39,526 --> 00:11:41,111
that would have

422
00:11:39,526 --> 00:11:41,111
given her offense.

423
00:11:41,153 --> 00:11:42,738
Nothing's ambiguous,

424
00:11:42,779 --> 00:11:44,323
I spell everything out.

425
00:11:44,365 --> 00:11:47,826
Including "laugh out loud"

426
00:11:44,365 --> 00:11:47,826
and "what's the fracas?"

427
00:11:47,868 --> 00:11:50,371
I'm sure she's not mad at you.

428
00:11:50,411 --> 00:11:53,040
Well, then why would she rather

429
00:11:50,411 --> 00:11:53,040
spend the day with Leonard?

430
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,044
Because he's her son?

431
00:11:57,086 --> 00:12:00,547
Amy, I just feel like

432
00:11:57,086 --> 00:12:00,547
we're going in circles.

433
00:12:00,589 --> 00:12:02,007
You— What?

434
00:12:02,049 --> 00:12:04,176
No knock? What's the fracas?

435
00:12:04,218 --> 00:12:05,802
(groans)

436
00:12:05,844 --> 00:12:07,470
I am so stupid.

437
00:12:07,512 --> 00:12:10,515
I-I actually thought my mom

438
00:12:07,512 --> 00:12:10,515
was genuinely proud of me.

439
00:12:10,557 --> 00:12:13,518
It turns out, she's just using

440
00:12:10,557 --> 00:12:13,518
me as research for her new book.

441
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:15,062
Oh, what a relief.

442
00:12:15,104 --> 00:12:17,273
I thought Beverly was mad at me.

443
00:12:15,104 --> 00:12:17,273
Thank you, Leonard.

444
00:12:19,608 --> 00:12:22,111
That is a weight

445
00:12:19,608 --> 00:12:22,111
off my shoulders.

446
00:12:22,152 --> 00:12:24,529
If you like her so much you can

447
00:12:22,152 --> 00:12:24,529
have her, 'cause I-I'm done.

448
00:12:24,571 --> 00:12:26,447
Oh, great.

449
00:12:24,571 --> 00:12:26,447
Catch the two of you later.

450
00:12:26,489 --> 00:12:28,284
Sheldon, no.

451
00:12:28,325 --> 00:12:31,412
Why?

452
00:12:28,325 --> 00:12:31,412
Well, it's an

453
00:12:28,325 --> 00:12:31,412
emotionally complex issue.

454
00:12:31,452 --> 00:12:33,247
I don't have time

455
00:12:31,452 --> 00:12:33,247
to explain it right now.

456
00:12:33,289 --> 00:12:35,916
Okay, but that excuse

457
00:12:33,289 --> 00:12:35,916
is running out of steam.

458
00:12:38,168 --> 00:12:41,338
Well, Raj is probably

459
00:12:38,168 --> 00:12:41,338
on his way to the airport.

460
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:44,049
Yeah.

461
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:44,049
Guess he's

462
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:44,049
finally getting

463
00:12:44,091 --> 00:12:46,427
his big romantic

464
00:12:44,091 --> 00:12:46,427
movie moment.

465
00:12:46,467 --> 00:12:48,387
With a woman who

466
00:12:46,467 --> 00:12:48,387
doesn't care about

467
00:12:48,429 --> 00:12:49,763
big romantic

468
00:12:48,429 --> 00:12:49,763
movie moments.

469
00:12:49,805 --> 00:12:52,015
Well, he'll have

470
00:12:49,805 --> 00:12:52,015
the rest of his life

471
00:12:52,057 --> 00:12:53,892
to explain them to her.

472
00:12:53,934 --> 00:12:56,603
You can't really think

473
00:12:53,934 --> 00:12:56,603
this is a good idea.

474
00:12:56,645 --> 00:12:59,148
Of course I don't.

475
00:12:56,645 --> 00:12:59,148
What am I supposed to do?

476
00:12:59,189 --> 00:13:01,482
Go stop him. Get your

477
00:12:59,189 --> 00:13:01,482
best friend back.

478
00:13:01,524 --> 00:13:03,026
(chuckles softly)

479
00:13:03,068 --> 00:13:04,945
You're my best friend.

480
00:13:03,068 --> 00:13:04,945
We don't have

481
00:13:03,068 --> 00:13:04,945
time for this!

482
00:13:04,987 --> 00:13:06,363
Go!

483
00:13:08,573 --> 00:13:11,618
You know, Leonard

484
00:13:08,573 --> 00:13:11,618
was really upset.

485
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:13,203
Shouldn't you go talk to him?

486
00:13:13,245 --> 00:13:15,456
And send the message

487
00:13:13,245 --> 00:13:15,456
that he can get what he wants

488
00:13:15,496 --> 00:13:19,001
by throwing a tantrum?

489
00:13:15,496 --> 00:13:19,001
I don't think so.

490
00:13:19,042 --> 00:13:23,005
Beverly, put down your phone

491
00:13:19,042 --> 00:13:23,005
and go apologize to your son.

492
00:13:26,716 --> 00:13:29,386
Oh, so now you're not

493
00:13:26,716 --> 00:13:29,386
talking to me?

494
00:13:29,428 --> 00:13:32,139
When you're finished with

495
00:13:29,428 --> 00:13:32,139
your tantrum, I'd be glad to.

496
00:13:32,181 --> 00:13:33,474
(groans)

497
00:13:33,514 --> 00:13:35,516
Just let me know

498
00:13:33,514 --> 00:13:35,516
when you're done.

499
00:13:35,558 --> 00:13:37,894
Oh, my God.

500
00:13:37,936 --> 00:13:40,814
When am I gonna stop

501
00:13:37,936 --> 00:13:40,814
trying to win her approval?

502
00:13:40,856 --> 00:13:42,316
E-Every time

503
00:13:40,856 --> 00:13:42,316
I'm around her,

504
00:13:42,358 --> 00:13:46,153
I-I turn into this needy

505
00:13:42,358 --> 00:13:46,153
little eight-year-old boy.

506
00:13:46,195 --> 00:13:49,781
You sound like that now

507
00:13:46,195 --> 00:13:49,781
and she's not even here.

508
00:13:50,949 --> 00:13:52,533
If I could respond

509
00:13:52,575 --> 00:13:55,078
more compassionately

510
00:13:52,575 --> 00:13:55,078
than Sheldon...

511
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:58,832
and thank you

512
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:58,832
for making it so easy.

513
00:14:00,501 --> 00:14:02,543
The need for a

514
00:14:00,501 --> 00:14:02,543
mother's approval

515
00:14:02,585 --> 00:14:04,838
is baked into

516
00:14:02,585 --> 00:14:04,838
our biology.

517
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,965
I know that, it's just...

518
00:14:07,007 --> 00:14:09,885
after all these years, you'd

519
00:14:07,007 --> 00:14:09,885
think I would have learned.

520
00:14:09,926 --> 00:14:12,846
Hmm. It's too bad you didn't.

521
00:14:13,763 --> 00:14:15,140
Well, see?

522
00:14:15,182 --> 00:14:17,184
Compassion.

523
00:14:21,771 --> 00:14:24,649
You okay?

524
00:14:21,771 --> 00:14:24,649
Oh, yeah.

525
00:14:21,771 --> 00:14:24,649
My neck's a little stiff.

526
00:14:24,691 --> 00:14:26,609
Maybe because my boyfriend

527
00:14:24,691 --> 00:14:26,609
made me sleep

528
00:14:26,651 --> 00:14:29,154
in a comic book store

529
00:14:26,651 --> 00:14:29,154
last night.

530
00:14:29,196 --> 00:14:32,366
Bet your neck would hurt

531
00:14:29,196 --> 00:14:32,366
if you slept in any store.

532
00:14:33,616 --> 00:14:36,828
Except maybe a mattress store.

533
00:14:36,870 --> 00:14:39,748
I-I'm sorry, but I couldn't

534
00:14:36,870 --> 00:14:39,748
sleep at your place.

535
00:14:39,789 --> 00:14:41,500
Mitch was really

536
00:14:39,789 --> 00:14:41,500
freaking me out.

537
00:14:41,542 --> 00:14:42,834
He was freaking me out, too,

538
00:14:42,876 --> 00:14:44,461
but there has to be

539
00:14:42,876 --> 00:14:44,461
a better solution.

540
00:14:44,503 --> 00:14:47,506
Tonight we'll go

541
00:14:44,503 --> 00:14:47,506
back to my place.

542
00:14:44,503 --> 00:14:47,506
And tomorrow?

543
00:14:48,507 --> 00:14:50,175
With my health being what it is,

544
00:14:50,217 --> 00:14:53,136
I try to live one day at a time.

545
00:14:53,178 --> 00:14:55,722
I don't want to blame you,

546
00:14:53,178 --> 00:14:55,722
but if you'd moved in with me

547
00:14:55,764 --> 00:14:58,100
when I asked you to, we wouldn't

548
00:14:55,764 --> 00:14:58,100
be in this situation.

549
00:14:59,976 --> 00:15:01,562
You're right.

550
00:15:01,603 --> 00:15:03,272
It's my fault.

551
00:15:05,107 --> 00:15:07,484
When I had the chance,

552
00:15:05,107 --> 00:15:07,484
I was scared and...

553
00:15:07,526 --> 00:15:10,737
now that I want to,

554
00:15:07,526 --> 00:15:10,737
you're stuck with Mitch.

555
00:15:10,779 --> 00:15:13,282
So you do want to

556
00:15:10,779 --> 00:15:13,282
move in with me?

557
00:15:13,323 --> 00:15:18,620
More than Galactus

558
00:15:13,323 --> 00:15:18,620
wants to devour worlds.

559
00:15:18,661 --> 00:15:21,290
Well, that's great 'cause

560
00:15:18,661 --> 00:15:21,290
I want to move in with you

561
00:15:21,331 --> 00:15:24,543
more than the Thing

562
00:15:21,331 --> 00:15:24,543
wants to clobber.

563
00:15:24,585 --> 00:15:28,046
More than Hulk

564
00:15:24,585 --> 00:15:28,046
wants to smash?

565
00:15:28,088 --> 00:15:30,257
More than Batman

566
00:15:28,088 --> 00:15:30,257
wants to ignore

567
00:15:30,299 --> 00:15:32,884
the due process of law.

568
00:15:34,344 --> 00:15:35,929
We are so weird.

569
00:15:39,099 --> 00:15:41,602
WOLOWITZ:

570
00:15:39,099 --> 00:15:41,602
Raj! Stop!

571
00:15:41,643 --> 00:15:43,853
(panting)

572
00:15:41,643 --> 00:15:43,853
What?

573
00:15:43,895 --> 00:15:46,148
What are you doing here?

574
00:15:46,189 --> 00:15:47,899
Look...

575
00:15:47,941 --> 00:15:49,443
if you're getting

576
00:15:47,941 --> 00:15:49,443
on that plane

577
00:15:49,485 --> 00:15:52,237
because you love

578
00:15:49,485 --> 00:15:52,237
Anu and you...

579
00:15:52,279 --> 00:15:54,239
can't stand the thought

580
00:15:52,279 --> 00:15:54,239
of spending another day

581
00:15:54,281 --> 00:15:57,075
without her...

582
00:15:54,281 --> 00:15:57,075
then go.

583
00:15:58,034 --> 00:15:59,661
If not...

584
00:15:59,702 --> 00:16:01,497
then stay here with...

585
00:16:01,538 --> 00:16:03,499
the people

586
00:16:01,538 --> 00:16:03,499
who love you.

587
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:07,503
But what if this is my last

588
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:07,503
chance at marriage and family?

589
00:16:07,544 --> 00:16:08,670
I promise you it's not.

590
00:16:08,711 --> 00:16:10,589
Believe me,

591
00:16:08,711 --> 00:16:10,589
somewhere out there

592
00:16:10,631 --> 00:16:13,883
is a woman who

593
00:16:10,631 --> 00:16:13,883
loves cooking shows

594
00:16:13,925 --> 00:16:16,470
and sweater

595
00:16:13,925 --> 00:16:16,470
vests and...

596
00:16:16,512 --> 00:16:19,681
all the other dumb

597
00:16:16,512 --> 00:16:19,681
things you love.

598
00:16:19,722 --> 00:16:21,475
You really think so?

599
00:16:21,517 --> 00:16:23,101
Yes.

600
00:16:23,143 --> 00:16:24,769
And I don't

601
00:16:23,143 --> 00:16:24,769
think she's...

602
00:16:24,811 --> 00:16:26,688
waiting for you

603
00:16:24,811 --> 00:16:26,688
in England.

604
00:16:28,064 --> 00:16:30,733
When you propose to

605
00:16:28,064 --> 00:16:30,733
someone in Notting Hill...

606
00:16:30,775 --> 00:16:34,112
it should be to someone who

607
00:16:30,775 --> 00:16:34,112
knows what that movie is.

608
00:16:35,697 --> 00:16:37,366
Are you saying...

609
00:16:37,407 --> 00:16:40,369
you're just a boy...

610
00:16:40,410 --> 00:16:43,997
standing in front

611
00:16:40,410 --> 00:16:43,997
of another boy...

612
00:16:44,039 --> 00:16:46,500
saying you don't

613
00:16:44,039 --> 00:16:46,500
want him to leave?

614
00:16:48,585 --> 00:16:50,962
Sure.

615
00:16:54,466 --> 00:16:56,092
I love you, buddy.

616
00:16:56,134 --> 00:16:58,178
I love you, too.

617
00:17:01,097 --> 00:17:02,474
No.

618
00:17:02,516 --> 00:17:05,101
No, no, that's not

619
00:17:02,516 --> 00:17:05,101
what's happening here.

620
00:17:05,143 --> 00:17:06,978
Come on.

621
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:08,522
How'd you get

622
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:08,522
past security?

623
00:17:08,564 --> 00:17:11,274
I had to buy a ticket.

624
00:17:08,564 --> 00:17:11,274
You owe me 1,300 bucks.

625
00:17:14,736 --> 00:17:15,987
Penny, can I have a moment alone

626
00:17:16,029 --> 00:17:17,573
with my...?

627
00:17:16,029 --> 00:17:17,573
Yep, bye.

628
00:17:20,950 --> 00:17:22,411
Have you calmed down?

629
00:17:22,452 --> 00:17:24,454
No, I'm not calm.

630
00:17:22,452 --> 00:17:24,454
You really hurt me.

631
00:17:24,496 --> 00:17:26,915
That wasn't my intention.

632
00:17:24,496 --> 00:17:26,915
It doesn't matter

633
00:17:26,956 --> 00:17:28,833
what you intended.

634
00:17:28,875 --> 00:17:30,835
What matters is the way

635
00:17:28,875 --> 00:17:30,835
you made me feel.

636
00:17:30,877 --> 00:17:33,922
Actually, the way y-you've

637
00:17:30,877 --> 00:17:33,922
always made me feel.

638
00:17:36,091 --> 00:17:37,509
I see, so...

639
00:17:37,551 --> 00:17:38,885
you're here to tell me

640
00:17:37,551 --> 00:17:38,885
all the ways

641
00:17:38,927 --> 00:17:42,055
that I failed you as a mother.

642
00:17:38,927 --> 00:17:42,055
Yeah.

643
00:17:42,097 --> 00:17:45,934
And get comfortable,

644
00:17:42,097 --> 00:17:45,934
'cause i-it's a long list.

645
00:17:48,478 --> 00:17:49,896
(exhales)

646
00:17:49,938 --> 00:17:53,108
Is it happening soon?

647
00:17:56,570 --> 00:17:58,071
You know what?

648
00:17:56,570 --> 00:17:58,071
It doesn't matter.

649
00:18:00,490 --> 00:18:02,743
Doesn't matter,

650
00:18:00,490 --> 00:18:02,743
you're never gonna change.

651
00:18:04,494 --> 00:18:06,955
If I want you

652
00:18:04,494 --> 00:18:06,955
to accept me for me,

653
00:18:06,996 --> 00:18:10,125
then I guess I'm gonna

654
00:18:06,996 --> 00:18:10,125
have to accept you for you.

655
00:18:10,166 --> 00:18:11,585
So...

656
00:18:13,629 --> 00:18:14,963
I forgive you.

657
00:18:15,004 --> 00:18:17,799
I didn't ask you to forgive me.

658
00:18:15,004 --> 00:18:17,799
Too bad.

659
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:20,761
I forgive you anyway.

660
00:18:20,802 --> 00:18:24,264
And I forgive myself for

661
00:18:20,802 --> 00:18:24,264
taking so long to do it.

662
00:18:25,223 --> 00:18:27,309
Oh, my God, that feels so good.

663
00:18:30,395 --> 00:18:34,023
I must admit, it...

664
00:18:34,065 --> 00:18:35,651
it does feel good.

665
00:18:37,944 --> 00:18:39,488
What does?

666
00:18:41,323 --> 00:18:43,408
You forgiving me.

667
00:18:46,578 --> 00:18:49,080
It means a lot.

668
00:18:50,081 --> 00:18:51,874
Thank you.

669
00:19:16,566 --> 00:19:18,652
(sniffles)

670
00:19:25,701 --> 00:19:29,412
Look, I was...

671
00:19:25,701 --> 00:19:29,412
scared to move in,

672
00:19:29,454 --> 00:19:32,248
but that was a mistake

673
00:19:29,454 --> 00:19:32,248
because she is amazing

674
00:19:32,290 --> 00:19:34,917
and I really want

675
00:19:32,290 --> 00:19:34,917
to live with her.

676
00:19:34,959 --> 00:19:36,336
So...

677
00:19:36,378 --> 00:19:38,921
think you'd be willing

678
00:19:36,378 --> 00:19:38,921
to find another place?

679
00:19:38,963 --> 00:19:40,215
Do you love her?

680
00:19:40,256 --> 00:19:41,591
Oh, we haven't

681
00:19:40,256 --> 00:19:41,591
really said that yet.

682
00:19:41,633 --> 00:19:43,218
Yeah, I do.

683
00:19:43,259 --> 00:19:45,512
Don't say it to me,

684
00:19:43,259 --> 00:19:45,512
say it to her.

685
00:19:49,098 --> 00:19:50,851
I love you.

686
00:19:50,892 --> 00:19:53,019
I love you, too.

687
00:19:54,937 --> 00:19:57,858
Now both of you say it to me.
