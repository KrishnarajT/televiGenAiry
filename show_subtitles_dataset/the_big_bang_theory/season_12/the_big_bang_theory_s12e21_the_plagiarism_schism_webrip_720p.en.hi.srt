1
00:00:09,336 --> 00:00:10,337
Previously on

2
00:00:09,336 --> 00:00:10,337
The Big Bang Theory...

3
00:00:10,379 --> 00:00:12,756
We conclusively proved

4
00:00:10,379 --> 00:00:12,756
super-asymmetry,

5
00:00:12,798 --> 00:00:15,217
and yet somehow

6
00:00:12,798 --> 00:00:15,217
we-we still feel like imposters.

7
00:00:15,258 --> 00:00:17,053
Yeah, there should be

8
00:00:15,258 --> 00:00:17,053
a term for that.

9
00:00:17,094 --> 00:00:19,763
Oh, for crying out loud,

10
00:00:17,094 --> 00:00:19,763
there is a term for that!

11
00:00:19,805 --> 00:00:21,891
It's called

12
00:00:19,805 --> 00:00:21,891
"imposter syndrome,"

13
00:00:21,932 --> 00:00:23,934
and you don't have it,

14
00:00:21,932 --> 00:00:23,934
because you can't have it

15
00:00:23,976 --> 00:00:26,228
if you are imposters,

16
00:00:23,976 --> 00:00:26,228
and you are!

17
00:00:26,269 --> 00:00:29,148
We're the ones who discovered

18
00:00:26,269 --> 00:00:29,148
super-asymmetry,

19
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:31,525
so if anyone's gonna feel like

20
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:31,525
they have imposter syndrome,

21
00:00:31,567 --> 00:00:35,320
it's us because we're

22
00:00:31,567 --> 00:00:35,320
not imposters, they are!

23
00:00:35,362 --> 00:00:38,281
You're imposters

24
00:00:35,362 --> 00:00:38,281
and you're frauds!

25
00:00:41,284 --> 00:00:43,704
I think what President Siebert

26
00:00:41,284 --> 00:00:43,704
is trying to say is that

27
00:00:43,746 --> 00:00:46,540
this is a setback and we should

28
00:00:43,746 --> 00:00:46,540
adopt a different strategy.

29
00:00:46,582 --> 00:00:49,168
I-I'm sorry.

30
00:00:46,582 --> 00:00:49,168
I-I just— I-I snapped.

31
00:00:49,210 --> 00:00:51,795
Oh, you're sorry.

32
00:00:49,210 --> 00:00:51,795
It's all better, then.

33
00:00:51,837 --> 00:00:54,631
Listen up, you have shot

34
00:00:51,837 --> 00:00:54,631
to win a Nobel Prize,

35
00:00:54,673 --> 00:00:56,050
and you're blowing it.

36
00:00:56,092 --> 00:00:58,259
I think what President Siebert

37
00:00:56,092 --> 00:00:58,259
is trying to say

38
00:00:58,301 --> 00:01:00,679
is that you have a shot

39
00:00:58,301 --> 00:01:00,679
to win a Nobel Prize,

40
00:01:00,721 --> 00:01:03,265
and you're blowing it.

41
00:01:03,306 --> 00:01:06,727
Uh, that's exactly

42
00:01:03,306 --> 00:01:06,727
what he said.

43
00:01:06,769 --> 00:01:09,980
Yes, but I said it

44
00:01:06,769 --> 00:01:09,980
in my calming HR voice.

45
00:01:12,441 --> 00:01:15,277
So, obviously,

46
00:01:15,318 --> 00:01:17,571
I'm really sorry

47
00:01:15,318 --> 00:01:17,571
about my outburst.

48
00:01:17,613 --> 00:01:19,823
(stammers) Calling you frauds

49
00:01:17,613 --> 00:01:19,823
was unacceptable.

50
00:01:19,865 --> 00:01:21,533
I feel terrible

51
00:01:19,865 --> 00:01:21,533
about it.

52
00:01:21,575 --> 00:01:23,452
It has caused her

53
00:01:21,575 --> 00:01:23,452
a lot of stress.

54
00:01:23,493 --> 00:01:24,954
She chewed through

55
00:01:23,493 --> 00:01:24,954
her night guard

56
00:01:24,995 --> 00:01:27,748
like it was a

57
00:01:24,995 --> 00:01:27,748
piece of jerky.

58
00:01:27,790 --> 00:01:29,625
What you said was

59
00:01:27,790 --> 00:01:29,625
really hurtful,

60
00:01:29,666 --> 00:01:31,585
especially because I

61
00:01:29,666 --> 00:01:31,585
thought we were friends.

62
00:01:31,627 --> 00:01:33,796
Why would you think that?

63
00:01:33,837 --> 00:01:36,799
Ouch.

64
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:39,802
Ignore them;

65
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:39,802
they're just mean people.

66
00:01:39,843 --> 00:01:42,138
Uh, not mean, just sorry.

67
00:01:42,179 --> 00:01:45,474
Seem mean, are sorry.

68
00:01:42,179 --> 00:01:45,474
Happens all the time.

69
00:01:45,515 --> 00:01:47,810
It's okay.

70
00:01:45,515 --> 00:01:47,810
I talked to my therapist,

71
00:01:47,851 --> 00:01:49,812
and she made me realize

72
00:01:47,851 --> 00:01:49,812
that what you said

73
00:01:49,853 --> 00:01:52,522
was really more about

74
00:01:49,853 --> 00:01:52,522
your own insecurities.

75
00:01:54,441 --> 00:01:56,443
I'm sorry, what?

76
00:01:56,485 --> 00:01:58,862
There you go, she's sorry.

77
00:01:56,485 --> 00:01:58,862
We all heard it. Moving on.

78
00:01:58,904 --> 00:02:00,864
Yes, obviously,

79
00:02:00,906 --> 00:02:02,866
you're angry at all

80
00:02:00,906 --> 00:02:02,866
the attention we're getting

81
00:02:02,908 --> 00:02:04,868
for our discovery

82
00:02:02,908 --> 00:02:04,868
and you're lashing out.

83
00:02:04,910 --> 00:02:07,746
Well, uh, technically,

84
00:02:04,910 --> 00:02:07,746
she lashed out.

85
00:02:07,788 --> 00:02:10,040
I contained myself,

86
00:02:07,788 --> 00:02:10,040
which I don't think

87
00:02:10,082 --> 00:02:12,334
I'm getting

88
00:02:10,082 --> 00:02:12,334
enough credit for.

89
00:02:12,375 --> 00:02:14,670
The point is we should

90
00:02:12,375 --> 00:02:14,670
take it as a compliment

91
00:02:14,711 --> 00:02:18,257
that even you guys think

92
00:02:14,711 --> 00:02:18,257
we will win the Nobel Prize.

93
00:02:18,299 --> 00:02:21,510
Uh, no, we-we certainly

94
00:02:18,299 --> 00:02:21,510
do not think that.

95
00:02:21,551 --> 00:02:23,053
The Nobel Committee

96
00:02:21,551 --> 00:02:23,053
will realize

97
00:02:23,095 --> 00:02:24,680
that we came up

98
00:02:23,095 --> 00:02:24,680
with this theory.

99
00:02:24,721 --> 00:02:26,890
But we proved it.

100
00:02:24,721 --> 00:02:26,890
By accident.

101
00:02:26,932 --> 00:02:29,518
All breakthroughs

102
00:02:26,932 --> 00:02:29,518
happen by accident.

103
00:02:29,559 --> 00:02:32,188
No, they don't!

104
00:02:33,897 --> 00:02:35,732
Look, the Nobel Committee

105
00:02:33,897 --> 00:02:35,732
doesn't like infighting,

106
00:02:35,774 --> 00:02:37,734
so if the four of you don't stop

107
00:02:35,774 --> 00:02:37,734
sniping at each other,

108
00:02:37,776 --> 00:02:39,611
the award's gonna go

109
00:02:37,776 --> 00:02:39,611
to someone else entirely.

110
00:02:39,653 --> 00:02:41,905
He's right.

111
00:02:41,947 --> 00:02:44,200
You know, like it or not,

112
00:02:41,947 --> 00:02:44,200
we can't avoid each other.

113
00:02:44,241 --> 00:02:46,451
Let's at least

114
00:02:44,241 --> 00:02:46,451
try to be civil.

115
00:02:46,493 --> 00:02:47,870
Agreed.

116
00:02:47,911 --> 00:02:49,663
You know, when you

117
00:02:47,911 --> 00:02:49,663
think about it,

118
00:02:49,705 --> 00:02:53,042
we're linked together the

119
00:02:49,705 --> 00:02:53,042
same way that super-asymmetry

120
00:02:53,083 --> 00:02:55,544
links together every atom

121
00:02:53,083 --> 00:02:55,544
in the universe.

122
00:02:53,083 --> 00:02:55,544
Hmm.

123
00:02:55,585 --> 00:02:58,088
That's not

124
00:02:55,585 --> 00:02:58,088
what it does at all!

125
00:03:00,049 --> 00:03:01,967
Well, that's the great thing

126
00:03:00,049 --> 00:03:01,967
about science.

127
00:03:02,009 --> 00:03:04,594
We all get to have

128
00:03:02,009 --> 00:03:04,594
our own opinions.

129
00:03:10,767 --> 00:03:14,271
I'm still not talking.

130
00:03:10,767 --> 00:03:14,271

Well, I'm glad that

148
00:03:46,428 --> 00:03:49,514
we hashed all that out,

149
00:03:49,556 --> 00:03:52,434
and moving forward,

150
00:03:49,556 --> 00:03:52,434
may the best team win.

151
00:03:52,475 --> 00:03:53,977
I couldn't agree more.

152
00:03:54,019 --> 00:03:56,521
(quietly):

153
00:03:54,019 --> 00:03:56,521
We're the best team.

154
00:03:56,563 --> 00:03:59,524
Greg Pemberton,

155
00:03:56,563 --> 00:03:59,524
you old so-and-so.

156
00:03:59,566 --> 00:04:01,151
(chuckles) Very good to see you.

157
00:04:01,193 --> 00:04:03,528
Uh, let me introduce you

158
00:04:01,193 --> 00:04:03,528
to my colleague, Dr. Campbell.

159
00:04:03,570 --> 00:04:05,906
Uh, Kevin, this is Barry Kripke.

160
00:04:03,570 --> 00:04:05,906
We went to college together.

161
00:04:05,948 --> 00:04:08,617
Great to meet you.

162
00:04:05,948 --> 00:04:08,617
Well, you have my number.

163
00:04:08,658 --> 00:04:10,411
We should hit up the

164
00:04:08,658 --> 00:04:10,411
buffet at the strip club

165
00:04:10,452 --> 00:04:12,246
while you're in town.

166
00:04:12,288 --> 00:04:14,998
Nothing beats a lap dance

167
00:04:12,288 --> 00:04:14,998
and a baked potato bar, huh?

168
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,292
(chuckles)

169
00:04:16,333 --> 00:04:17,626
You can come, too.

170
00:04:17,667 --> 00:04:19,711
That's a hard pass.

171
00:04:19,753 --> 00:04:22,089
I'll walk you out.

172
00:04:22,131 --> 00:04:24,133
PEMBERTON:

173
00:04:22,131 --> 00:04:24,133
Good to see you, Barry.

174
00:04:24,174 --> 00:04:26,427
You're the best!

175
00:04:26,468 --> 00:04:27,928
Oh...

176
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:30,347
God, I hate that guy.

177
00:04:30,389 --> 00:04:33,558
That's strange; you

178
00:04:30,389 --> 00:04:33,558
seem quite fond of him.

179
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:37,104
I was only being polite.

180
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:37,104
Pemberton is a grade A weasel.

181
00:04:37,146 --> 00:04:38,981
How do I know you're

182
00:04:37,146 --> 00:04:38,981
not just being polite

183
00:04:39,022 --> 00:04:40,649
when you say it's

184
00:04:39,022 --> 00:04:40,649
nice to see me?

185
00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:43,944
I have literally

186
00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:43,944
never said that to you.

187
00:04:45,237 --> 00:04:47,656
Why do you say he's a weasel?

188
00:04:47,697 --> 00:04:49,866
(sighs) Pemberton's whole M.O.

189
00:04:49,908 --> 00:04:52,744
was to take other people's ideas

190
00:04:49,908 --> 00:04:52,744
and turn them in as his own.

191
00:04:52,786 --> 00:04:54,871
That's exactly what

192
00:04:52,786 --> 00:04:54,871
he's doing to us.

193
00:04:54,913 --> 00:04:57,749
I'm not surprised. I heard the

194
00:04:54,913 --> 00:04:57,749
only work he did on his thesis

195
00:04:57,791 --> 00:05:01,044
was googling,

196
00:04:57,791 --> 00:05:01,044
"Where can I buy a thesis?"

197
00:05:01,086 --> 00:05:05,132
Well, plagiarism is a pretty

198
00:05:01,086 --> 00:05:05,132
serious charge. Are you sure?

199
00:05:05,174 --> 00:05:07,592
You want proof?

200
00:05:05,174 --> 00:05:07,592
I can make some calls.

201
00:05:07,634 --> 00:05:09,428
You'd do that for us?

202
00:05:09,470 --> 00:05:12,514
I really don't want to see

203
00:05:09,470 --> 00:05:12,514
that guy win a Nobel.

204
00:05:12,555 --> 00:05:14,724
I also don't want

205
00:05:12,555 --> 00:05:14,724
to see you win a Nobel.

206
00:05:14,766 --> 00:05:16,518
Ooh, this is tricky.

207
00:05:18,395 --> 00:05:20,897
I don't know, Barry.

208
00:05:18,395 --> 00:05:20,897
It sounds a little sleazy.

209
00:05:20,939 --> 00:05:23,900
Well, let me know

210
00:05:20,939 --> 00:05:23,900
if you change your mind.

211
00:05:23,942 --> 00:05:26,695
Sleazy is where I thrive.

212
00:05:30,032 --> 00:05:31,825
So I was talking

213
00:05:30,032 --> 00:05:31,825
to my mom

214
00:05:31,867 --> 00:05:33,327
about our Pemberton

215
00:05:31,867 --> 00:05:33,327
and Campbell situation.

216
00:05:33,369 --> 00:05:35,329
Really? What'd she say?

217
00:05:35,371 --> 00:05:37,580
Apparently, Old Testament God

218
00:05:35,371 --> 00:05:37,580
would bring down his wrath

219
00:05:37,622 --> 00:05:39,291
on them for being deceitful,

220
00:05:39,333 --> 00:05:41,335
but New Testament God

221
00:05:39,333 --> 00:05:41,335
would forgive them.

222
00:05:43,962 --> 00:05:46,215
So couldn't we just

223
00:05:43,962 --> 00:05:46,215
bring down our wrath

224
00:05:46,256 --> 00:05:48,591
and ask the New Testament God

225
00:05:46,256 --> 00:05:48,591
to forgive us?

226
00:05:48,633 --> 00:05:50,886
You know, I asked her

227
00:05:48,633 --> 00:05:50,886
that very question.

228
00:05:48,633 --> 00:05:50,886
And?

229
00:05:50,927 --> 00:05:52,846
She said I was full

230
00:05:50,927 --> 00:05:52,846
of California sass.

231
00:05:54,848 --> 00:05:57,267
Oh, good, you're all here.

232
00:05:54,848 --> 00:05:57,267
Uh, we're wrestling

233
00:05:57,309 --> 00:05:59,644
with an ethical question,

234
00:05:57,309 --> 00:05:59,644
and perhaps you could help.

235
00:05:59,686 --> 00:06:01,271
Sure, what's up?

236
00:05:59,686 --> 00:06:01,271
Yeah.

237
00:05:59,686 --> 00:06:01,271
Fire away.

238
00:06:01,313 --> 00:06:03,690
If we have damaging

239
00:06:01,313 --> 00:06:03,690
and embarrassing information

240
00:06:03,732 --> 00:06:07,486
about someone, should we keep it

241
00:06:03,732 --> 00:06:07,486
to ourselves or expose them?

242
00:06:11,614 --> 00:06:13,909
Quick question: Does it happen

243
00:06:11,614 --> 00:06:13,909
to do with online tastes

244
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:16,286
that might or might not reflect

245
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:16,286
their real-life tastes?

246
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,040
I know all about your

247
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,040
tall girl website.

248
00:06:20,082 --> 00:06:21,750
It goes on our

249
00:06:20,082 --> 00:06:21,750
credit card.

250
00:06:24,086 --> 00:06:26,338
It's Dr. Pemberton.

251
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:28,465
Kripke says

252
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:28,465
he plagiarized his thesis,

253
00:06:28,507 --> 00:06:30,050
and that he can prove it.

254
00:06:30,092 --> 00:06:31,552
Wow. Well, that's not gonna

255
00:06:31,592 --> 00:06:33,470
sit well with

256
00:06:31,592 --> 00:06:33,470
the Nobel Committee.

257
00:06:33,512 --> 00:06:35,556
Hang on. I don't think

258
00:06:33,512 --> 00:06:35,556
it's fair to use something

259
00:06:35,596 --> 00:06:38,058
someone did in school

260
00:06:35,596 --> 00:06:38,058
against them.

261
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:41,228
Relax, he said

262
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:41,228
it's not you.

263
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:43,188
I don't know.

264
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:43,188
If someone's a cheater,

265
00:06:43,230 --> 00:06:46,108
they should be held accountable

266
00:06:43,230 --> 00:06:46,108
no matter how long ago it was.

267
00:06:46,149 --> 00:06:49,986
(laughs): Okay, now

268
00:06:46,149 --> 00:06:49,986
you just sound crazy.

269
00:06:50,028 --> 00:06:52,114
So you really think

270
00:06:50,028 --> 00:06:52,114
they should do this?

271
00:06:52,155 --> 00:06:54,324
(stammers) It wouldn't

272
00:06:52,155 --> 00:06:54,324
just knock Pemberton

273
00:06:54,366 --> 00:06:57,327
out of Nobel contention, it

274
00:06:54,366 --> 00:06:57,327
would blow up his whole career.

275
00:06:57,369 --> 00:06:59,704
To that, I say kaboom!

276
00:07:01,373 --> 00:07:03,917
No, I meant

277
00:07:01,373 --> 00:07:03,917
it's a bad thing.

278
00:07:03,959 --> 00:07:05,127
No, no, I agree

279
00:07:03,959 --> 00:07:05,127
with Bernadette.

280
00:07:05,168 --> 00:07:07,003
If Pemberton cheated,

281
00:07:07,045 --> 00:07:08,797
maybe he shouldn't have a career

282
00:07:07,045 --> 00:07:08,797
in the first place.

283
00:07:08,838 --> 00:07:10,715
There's plenty of people

284
00:07:08,838 --> 00:07:10,715
that didn't plagiarize.

285
00:07:10,757 --> 00:07:12,968
And a few of us who did,

286
00:07:10,757 --> 00:07:12,968
but it's only 'cause

287
00:07:13,009 --> 00:07:14,928
The Scarlet Letter

288
00:07:13,009 --> 00:07:14,928
was so boring.

289
00:07:16,888 --> 00:07:19,099
Aw, I love

290
00:07:16,888 --> 00:07:19,099
The Scarlet Letter.

291
00:07:19,141 --> 00:07:21,810
Th-That's where I got

292
00:07:19,141 --> 00:07:21,810
my taste for bad girls.

293
00:07:23,562 --> 00:07:27,149
Ugh, why is this

294
00:07:23,562 --> 00:07:27,149
decision so hard?

295
00:07:27,190 --> 00:07:29,818
Maybe because

296
00:07:27,190 --> 00:07:29,818
you want to win,

297
00:07:29,859 --> 00:07:32,571
but deep down you know it's not

298
00:07:29,859 --> 00:07:32,571
the honorable way to do it.

299
00:07:32,613 --> 00:07:34,114
Otherwise, you would've

300
00:07:32,613 --> 00:07:34,114
done it already.

301
00:07:34,156 --> 00:07:35,824
That's really wise.

302
00:07:35,865 --> 00:07:39,661
Yes, but it may just be

303
00:07:35,865 --> 00:07:39,661
the Indian accent.

304
00:07:43,582 --> 00:07:46,001
Do you think

305
00:07:43,582 --> 00:07:46,001
by not exposing Pemberton

306
00:07:46,042 --> 00:07:48,086
we're doing

307
00:07:46,042 --> 00:07:48,086
the right thing?

308
00:07:48,128 --> 00:07:50,005
Of course.

309
00:07:50,046 --> 00:07:53,300
Unless you think we're not

310
00:07:50,046 --> 00:07:53,300
doing the right thing.

311
00:07:53,342 --> 00:07:54,801
Why would you think

312
00:07:53,342 --> 00:07:54,801
that I don't think

313
00:07:54,843 --> 00:07:56,595
we're doing the right thing?

314
00:07:56,637 --> 00:08:00,140
You might think that if

315
00:07:56,637 --> 00:08:00,140
good people hold themselves

316
00:08:00,182 --> 00:08:02,142
to unrealistically high

317
00:08:00,182 --> 00:08:02,142
ethical standards,

318
00:08:02,184 --> 00:08:05,145
then they might lose out to

319
00:08:02,184 --> 00:08:05,145
their unscrupulous competitors.

320
00:08:05,187 --> 00:08:07,648
Is that what you think?

321
00:08:05,187 --> 00:08:07,648
No.

322
00:08:07,689 --> 00:08:09,483
No, I just thought

323
00:08:07,689 --> 00:08:09,483
if you thought we weren't

324
00:08:09,525 --> 00:08:12,402
doing the right thing,

325
00:08:09,525 --> 00:08:12,402
that's why you might think that.

326
00:08:12,444 --> 00:08:14,696
Well, if I did think that,

327
00:08:14,737 --> 00:08:17,032
you might point out

328
00:08:14,737 --> 00:08:17,032
that people who claim

329
00:08:17,073 --> 00:08:19,451
it's okay to do

330
00:08:17,073 --> 00:08:19,451
bad things to win

331
00:08:19,493 --> 00:08:22,078
are bad people no matter

332
00:08:19,493 --> 00:08:22,078
what they tell themselves.

333
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,830
And I'd be right

334
00:08:23,872 --> 00:08:25,081
to point that out.

335
00:08:25,123 --> 00:08:26,791
Because you're a good person.

336
00:08:28,627 --> 00:08:31,213
I love talking

337
00:08:28,627 --> 00:08:31,213
to you.

338
00:08:31,254 --> 00:08:33,715
It's like talking to me,

339
00:08:31,254 --> 00:08:33,715
but with a girl voice.

340
00:08:37,177 --> 00:08:40,096
I'm just saying, Sheldon

341
00:08:37,177 --> 00:08:40,096
and Amy deserve to win,

342
00:08:40,138 --> 00:08:42,349
and sometimes that means

343
00:08:40,138 --> 00:08:42,349
doing what you got to do.

344
00:08:42,391 --> 00:08:45,018
Don't you think it's better

345
00:08:42,391 --> 00:08:45,018
to take the high road?

346
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:46,853
Yeah, and instead of guns,

347
00:08:46,895 --> 00:08:50,649
armies should carry

348
00:08:46,895 --> 00:08:50,649
candy canes that shoot wishes.

349
00:08:50,691 --> 00:08:52,275
So what's the worst thing

350
00:08:50,691 --> 00:08:52,275
you've ever done

351
00:08:52,317 --> 00:08:53,902
to get something

352
00:08:52,317 --> 00:08:53,902
you wanted?

353
00:08:53,943 --> 00:08:55,487
I'm not gonna

354
00:08:53,943 --> 00:08:55,487
tell you that.

355
00:08:55,529 --> 00:08:57,906
Oh, come on.

356
00:08:55,529 --> 00:08:57,906
I'll tell you mine.

357
00:08:57,947 --> 00:09:00,659
(laughs): Right,

358
00:08:57,947 --> 00:09:00,659
'cause yours is gonna be

359
00:09:00,701 --> 00:09:03,245
as bad as mine. Okay.

360
00:09:03,286 --> 00:09:05,747
(chuckles)

361
00:09:03,286 --> 00:09:05,747
Come on, just tell me.

362
00:09:05,788 --> 00:09:07,708
Okay, fine.

363
00:09:07,749 --> 00:09:10,126
When we first met,

364
00:09:07,749 --> 00:09:10,126
there was another waitress

365
00:09:10,168 --> 00:09:12,170
at The Cheesecake Factory

366
00:09:10,168 --> 00:09:12,170
who thought you were cute,

367
00:09:12,212 --> 00:09:17,008
so I told her you had all

368
00:09:12,212 --> 00:09:17,008
the hepatitises, A through Z.

369
00:09:17,050 --> 00:09:19,636
There aren't

370
00:09:17,050 --> 00:09:19,636
26 hepatitises.

371
00:09:19,678 --> 00:09:21,513
Well, if she was smart

372
00:09:19,678 --> 00:09:21,513
enough to know that,

373
00:09:21,555 --> 00:09:23,932
she wouldn't still be working

374
00:09:21,555 --> 00:09:23,932
at a Cheesecake Factory.

375
00:09:23,973 --> 00:09:25,767
Oh, she still works there?

376
00:09:23,973 --> 00:09:25,767
Who was it?

377
00:09:25,808 --> 00:09:28,103
Why does it matter?

378
00:09:28,144 --> 00:09:31,231
You're right, it doesn't matter

379
00:09:28,144 --> 00:09:31,231
'cause I got the best one.

380
00:09:33,108 --> 00:09:34,776
Was it Susan?

381
00:09:34,817 --> 00:09:36,236
Why? Because she's tall?

382
00:09:36,278 --> 00:09:38,405
Good night.

383
00:09:39,822 --> 00:09:41,950
Can't believe it.

384
00:09:41,991 --> 00:09:44,453
Sheldon loves telling on people

385
00:09:41,991 --> 00:09:44,453
when they break the rules.

386
00:09:44,494 --> 00:09:46,580
Yeah, well, maybe he's changed.

387
00:09:46,622 --> 00:09:48,624
He hasn't changed. Last week,

388
00:09:46,622 --> 00:09:48,624
when the vending machine

389
00:09:48,665 --> 00:09:51,793
gave me two bags of chips,

390
00:09:48,665 --> 00:09:51,793
he called my mom.

391
00:09:51,834 --> 00:09:53,712
Well, that didn't

392
00:09:51,834 --> 00:09:53,712
ruin your life.

393
00:09:53,754 --> 00:09:54,963
Well, it ruined my day.

394
00:09:55,004 --> 00:09:57,799
I had to talk to my mom,

395
00:09:55,004 --> 00:09:57,799
who, by the way,

396
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:02,304
is-is polyamorous now,

397
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:02,304
so that's fun to think about.

398
00:10:02,345 --> 00:10:04,473
Look, I'm proud

399
00:10:02,345 --> 00:10:04,473
of Sheldon and Amy.

400
00:10:04,514 --> 00:10:06,725
You know? They want to win

401
00:10:04,514 --> 00:10:06,725
this thing on their own merits,

402
00:10:06,767 --> 00:10:08,727
not by knocking out

403
00:10:06,767 --> 00:10:08,727
the competition.

404
00:10:08,769 --> 00:10:10,479
Yeah, but what if

405
00:10:08,769 --> 00:10:10,479
they don't win?

406
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:12,481
Uh, Pemberton and Campbell

407
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:12,481
have done an amazing job

408
00:10:12,522 --> 00:10:14,650
of associating their names

409
00:10:12,522 --> 00:10:14,650
with super-asymmetry.

410
00:10:14,691 --> 00:10:16,735
They have all

411
00:10:14,691 --> 00:10:16,735
the momentum right now.

412
00:10:16,777 --> 00:10:18,403
I don't like the idea

413
00:10:16,777 --> 00:10:18,403
of them losing either,

414
00:10:18,445 --> 00:10:20,989
but this is their decision

415
00:10:18,445 --> 00:10:20,989
to make, not ours.

416
00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:23,533
(sighs)

417
00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:23,533
Maybe it is ours.

418
00:10:23,575 --> 00:10:25,535
What do you mean?

419
00:10:25,577 --> 00:10:28,705
Well, i-if Sheldon and Amy

420
00:10:25,577 --> 00:10:28,705
don't want to expose Pemberton,

421
00:10:28,747 --> 00:10:31,249
that doesn't mean someone else

422
00:10:28,747 --> 00:10:31,249
can't do it for them.

423
00:10:31,291 --> 00:10:33,001
They'd never have to know.

424
00:10:33,042 --> 00:10:34,836
Really? You'd do that?

425
00:10:34,877 --> 00:10:36,672
They deserve the Nobel.

426
00:10:36,713 --> 00:10:38,674
I'm not gonna let two frauds

427
00:10:36,713 --> 00:10:38,674
steal it from them.

428
00:10:38,715 --> 00:10:41,384
And if that means getting

429
00:10:38,715 --> 00:10:41,384
my hands dirty, so be it.

430
00:10:41,426 --> 00:10:44,805
(laughs)

431
00:10:41,426 --> 00:10:44,805
What's so funny?

432
00:10:44,846 --> 00:10:48,767
Just realized I've never

433
00:10:44,846 --> 00:10:48,767
actually seen your hands dirty.

434
00:10:50,893 --> 00:10:53,814
All right, Hofstadter, here's

435
00:10:50,893 --> 00:10:53,814
all the proof you need.

436
00:10:53,855 --> 00:10:55,649
Great, thanks.

437
00:10:53,855 --> 00:10:55,649
Just remember,

438
00:10:55,691 --> 00:10:59,444
once you take this envelope,

439
00:10:55,691 --> 00:10:59,444
there's no turning back.

440
00:10:59,486 --> 00:11:02,071
What if I look at it

441
00:10:59,486 --> 00:11:02,071
and decide not to use it?

442
00:11:05,659 --> 00:11:07,577
I had not considered that.

443
00:11:08,578 --> 00:11:10,246
Got to hand it to you,

444
00:11:10,288 --> 00:11:11,748
you got a real talent

445
00:11:10,288 --> 00:11:11,748
for making things boring.

446
00:11:11,790 --> 00:11:13,834
Thanks.

447
00:11:13,875 --> 00:11:16,002
Hey, look at that,

448
00:11:13,875 --> 00:11:16,002
you did it again.

449
00:11:18,129 --> 00:11:19,297
Hi, Leonard.

450
00:11:19,339 --> 00:11:21,132
What? Nothing.

451
00:11:21,174 --> 00:11:23,051
You okay?

452
00:11:23,092 --> 00:11:24,344
Uh, no, you are.

453
00:11:29,766 --> 00:11:32,853
So guess what.

454
00:11:29,766 --> 00:11:32,853
There was a waitress

455
00:11:32,893 --> 00:11:34,855
at The Cheesecake Factory

456
00:11:32,893 --> 00:11:34,855
back in the day

457
00:11:34,895 --> 00:11:36,939
who kind of had a thing for me.

458
00:11:36,981 --> 00:11:40,569
Other than Bernadette?

459
00:11:36,981 --> 00:11:40,569
That does not sound right.

460
00:11:40,610 --> 00:11:43,405
Honest to God.

461
00:11:40,610 --> 00:11:43,405
Oh, well, who was it?

462
00:11:43,446 --> 00:11:45,323
It doesn't even matter.

463
00:11:43,446 --> 00:11:45,323
I'm happily married.

464
00:11:45,365 --> 00:11:48,410
The point is women— plural—

465
00:11:45,365 --> 00:11:48,410
find me appealing.

466
00:11:48,451 --> 00:11:50,911
Okay. Okay, well,

467
00:11:48,451 --> 00:11:50,911
well, let's see.

468
00:11:50,953 --> 00:11:53,081
Okay? We-we know

469
00:11:50,953 --> 00:11:53,081
it wasn't Penny,

470
00:11:53,122 --> 00:11:55,417
we know it wasn't Susan...

471
00:11:53,122 --> 00:11:55,417
Wait.

472
00:11:55,458 --> 00:11:56,835
How do we know it wasn't Susan?

473
00:11:56,877 --> 00:11:58,587
Uh, because she had a type.

474
00:11:58,628 --> 00:11:59,880
What type?

475
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:02,716
Don't make me say it.

476
00:12:02,758 --> 00:12:05,719
Are you saying

477
00:12:02,758 --> 00:12:05,719
I'm not a handsome guy?

478
00:12:05,761 --> 00:12:08,430
See? It's mean, right?

479
00:12:10,807 --> 00:12:12,768
Hold on, as we've established,

480
00:12:12,809 --> 00:12:15,478
a minimum of two women

481
00:12:12,809 --> 00:12:15,478
think I'm attractive.

482
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:18,648
Uh, yeah, you're right,

483
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:18,648
it was totally Susan.

484
00:12:18,690 --> 00:12:21,526
I didn't say it was her.

485
00:12:18,690 --> 00:12:21,526
I said it could've been.

486
00:12:21,568 --> 00:12:24,738
It could've been anybody.

487
00:12:21,568 --> 00:12:24,738
Marta, Gina, Annalise...

488
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:28,283
It's a little creepy that

489
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:28,283
you remember all their names.

490
00:12:28,324 --> 00:12:29,785
Not just their names.

491
00:12:29,826 --> 00:12:31,912
The cars they drove,

492
00:12:29,826 --> 00:12:31,912
the color of their eyes,

493
00:12:31,952 --> 00:12:33,954
and whether or not

494
00:12:31,952 --> 00:12:33,954
they had boyfriends.

495
00:12:36,708 --> 00:12:39,001
Your husband was acting

496
00:12:36,708 --> 00:12:39,001
kind of weird today.

497
00:12:39,043 --> 00:12:42,338
You sure you're not thinking

498
00:12:39,043 --> 00:12:42,338
about your husband?

499
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:44,965
No. He was acting all sketchy.

500
00:12:45,007 --> 00:12:46,802
Almost like he was guilty

501
00:12:45,007 --> 00:12:46,802
or something.

502
00:12:46,843 --> 00:12:48,303
Oh. Well,

503
00:12:46,843 --> 00:12:48,303
that doesn't mean anything.

504
00:12:48,344 --> 00:12:51,306
I mean, Leonard has

505
00:12:48,344 --> 00:12:51,306
resting guilt face.

506
00:12:51,347 --> 00:12:53,308
Yeah, it's-it's like, "What are

507
00:12:51,347 --> 00:12:53,308
you guilty about, Leonard?"

508
00:12:53,349 --> 00:12:55,894
"Nothing."Well, then,

509
00:12:53,349 --> 00:12:55,894
tell it to your face." (scoffs)

510
00:12:55,936 --> 00:12:58,020
Are you okay?

511
00:12:58,062 --> 00:12:59,731
I'm so okay, yeah.

512
00:12:59,773 --> 00:13:02,024
Then why are you

513
00:12:59,773 --> 00:13:02,024
acting guilty now?

514
00:13:03,151 --> 00:13:04,985
Okay, look, Leonard knows

515
00:13:05,027 --> 00:13:07,280
that you and Sheldon

516
00:13:05,027 --> 00:13:07,280
decided to take the high road,

517
00:13:07,322 --> 00:13:09,115
so he went to

518
00:13:07,322 --> 00:13:09,115
Kripke for you.

519
00:13:09,157 --> 00:13:10,909
But that just means you

520
00:13:09,157 --> 00:13:10,909
didn't do anything wrong,

521
00:13:10,951 --> 00:13:12,786
and now you don't risk

522
00:13:10,951 --> 00:13:12,786
losing to those idiots.

523
00:13:12,828 --> 00:13:14,663
Why did you tell me?

524
00:13:14,704 --> 00:13:17,039
Now that I know, I'm implicated.

525
00:13:17,081 --> 00:13:18,291
But you wanted me to.

526
00:13:18,333 --> 00:13:20,460
I also wanted you

527
00:13:18,333 --> 00:13:20,460
to be my jester

528
00:13:20,502 --> 00:13:22,921
at the Renaissance Fair,

529
00:13:20,502 --> 00:13:22,921
but that didn't happen.

530
00:13:22,963 --> 00:13:25,465
I wanted to be a princess.

531
00:13:25,507 --> 00:13:28,844
There was only one princess,

532
00:13:25,507 --> 00:13:28,844
and it was me!

533
00:13:28,885 --> 00:13:32,012
Fine. I'm sorry I told you.

534
00:13:32,054 --> 00:13:34,014
And I forgive you.

535
00:13:34,056 --> 00:13:36,810
'Cause that's what

536
00:13:34,056 --> 00:13:36,810
a princess would do.

537
00:13:38,227 --> 00:13:40,355
Kudos on the meatballs.

538
00:13:40,396 --> 00:13:42,315
They're nice and round.

539
00:13:44,066 --> 00:13:45,819
Thanks.

540
00:13:44,066 --> 00:13:45,819
Yeah.

541
00:13:45,861 --> 00:13:47,654
They're much better

542
00:13:45,861 --> 00:13:47,654
than those prolate spheroids

543
00:13:47,696 --> 00:13:50,156
you used to pass off as balls.

544
00:13:50,198 --> 00:13:51,867
Okay.

545
00:13:51,908 --> 00:13:54,744
Are you all right?

546
00:13:51,908 --> 00:13:54,744
You seem distracted.

547
00:13:54,786 --> 00:13:58,373
Yeah, sorry. I'm just trying

548
00:13:54,786 --> 00:13:58,373
to figure something out.

549
00:13:58,414 --> 00:14:00,166
Is it what to get me

550
00:13:58,414 --> 00:14:00,166
for our anniversary?

551
00:14:00,208 --> 00:14:01,918
'Cause I'll give you

552
00:14:00,208 --> 00:14:01,918
a hint: it's already

553
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:04,379
in my Amazon basket.

554
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:04,379
Just click "buy now."

555
00:14:06,589 --> 00:14:08,299
I filled out

556
00:14:06,589 --> 00:14:08,299
the gift card for you.

557
00:14:08,341 --> 00:14:11,219
Apparently,

558
00:14:08,341 --> 00:14:11,219
I'm the light of your life.

559
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:15,055
Sheldon, if someone

560
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:15,055
were gonna do something

561
00:14:15,097 --> 00:14:17,308
ethically murky on your behalf,

562
00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:19,143
would you rather

563
00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:19,143
know about it

564
00:14:19,185 --> 00:14:22,438
or not know about it

565
00:14:19,185 --> 00:14:22,438
to retain your innocence?

566
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:26,568
Well, now that I know there's

567
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:26,568
a thing to know, I have to know.

568
00:14:26,609 --> 00:14:29,237
Can't help myself;

569
00:14:26,609 --> 00:14:29,237
I'm a fact addict.

570
00:14:29,278 --> 00:14:30,989
That's not a real thing.

571
00:14:31,031 --> 00:14:32,866
And that's a fact.

572
00:14:34,576 --> 00:14:37,620
Leonard, I know

573
00:14:34,576 --> 00:14:37,620
what you're planning to do,

574
00:14:37,662 --> 00:14:39,163
and I said

575
00:14:37,662 --> 00:14:39,163
I didn't want to do it.

576
00:14:39,205 --> 00:14:41,708
What? You told him?

577
00:14:39,205 --> 00:14:41,708
Well, you told me.

578
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:43,919
Yeah, that's-that's

579
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:43,919
probably where you heard it.

580
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:47,047
You're not

581
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:47,047
doing anything wrong.

582
00:14:47,088 --> 00:14:48,798
That's the point.

583
00:14:47,088 --> 00:14:48,798
I'm doing it.

584
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:50,592
Yeah, but it's still wrong.

585
00:14:50,633 --> 00:14:52,343
Well, so is

586
00:14:50,633 --> 00:14:52,343
you and Amy not getting

587
00:14:52,385 --> 00:14:53,762
the recognition

588
00:14:52,385 --> 00:14:53,762
for your discovery.

589
00:14:53,803 --> 00:14:55,931
And if that means

590
00:14:53,803 --> 00:14:55,931
I have to do something shady

591
00:14:55,972 --> 00:14:58,224
so you don't have to,

592
00:14:55,972 --> 00:14:58,224
I'm okay with that.

593
00:14:58,266 --> 00:15:00,226
But we're not.

594
00:14:58,266 --> 00:15:00,226
I mean, it's sweet

595
00:15:00,268 --> 00:15:02,520
that you want to help,

596
00:15:00,268 --> 00:15:02,520
but we don't want you

597
00:15:02,562 --> 00:15:04,814
compromising your integrity

598
00:15:02,562 --> 00:15:04,814
for us.

599
00:15:04,856 --> 00:15:07,316
Wait, what— really?

600
00:15:07,358 --> 00:15:09,652
I thought we were just

601
00:15:07,358 --> 00:15:09,652
worried about looking bad.

602
00:15:09,694 --> 00:15:11,780
It could be both.

603
00:15:11,821 --> 00:15:13,865
Okay.

604
00:15:13,907 --> 00:15:16,576
But I'm gonna go with my reason.

605
00:15:13,907 --> 00:15:16,576
Yours is too complicated.

606
00:15:20,162 --> 00:15:21,664
Hey.

607
00:15:21,706 --> 00:15:22,958
Hey.

608
00:15:22,999 --> 00:15:24,292
Listen, I did something

609
00:15:24,333 --> 00:15:26,586
kind of stupid today.

610
00:15:26,628 --> 00:15:28,838
Okay.

611
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:30,506
I went to The Cheesecake Factory

612
00:15:30,548 --> 00:15:33,885
to try to figure out

613
00:15:30,548 --> 00:15:33,885
who that waitress was.

614
00:15:33,927 --> 00:15:35,887
Howie.

615
00:15:33,927 --> 00:15:35,887
Don't worry, I didn't find out,

616
00:15:35,929 --> 00:15:38,807
because I realized

617
00:15:35,929 --> 00:15:38,807
I didn't even care. (chuckles)

618
00:15:38,848 --> 00:15:41,434
W-While I was there,

619
00:15:38,848 --> 00:15:41,434
I started asking myself,

620
00:15:41,476 --> 00:15:43,311
"Why does this mean

621
00:15:41,476 --> 00:15:43,311
anything to me?"

622
00:15:43,352 --> 00:15:49,067
And... I guess the truth is

623
00:15:43,352 --> 00:15:49,067
it was all about my vanity.

624
00:15:49,109 --> 00:15:52,988
And why should I need to be

625
00:15:49,109 --> 00:15:52,988
validated by another woman

626
00:15:53,029 --> 00:15:58,034
liking me when the best woman

627
00:15:53,029 --> 00:15:58,034
in the world already loves me?

628
00:15:58,076 --> 00:15:59,494
(sighs)

629
00:15:59,535 --> 00:16:02,080
And I just wanted

630
00:15:59,535 --> 00:16:02,080
you to know that.

631
00:16:02,122 --> 00:16:03,748
(chuckles)

632
00:16:03,790 --> 00:16:05,291
The restaurant manager

633
00:16:03,790 --> 00:16:05,291
already called.

634
00:16:05,333 --> 00:16:07,127
You really creeped

635
00:16:05,333 --> 00:16:07,127
a lot of people out.

636
00:16:08,837 --> 00:16:12,381
And I regret that.

637
00:16:08,837 --> 00:16:12,381
(chuckles)

638
00:16:12,423 --> 00:16:15,176
Because the only woman

639
00:16:12,423 --> 00:16:15,176
I want to creep out

640
00:16:15,217 --> 00:16:16,970
is the mother

641
00:16:15,217 --> 00:16:16,970
of my children.

642
00:16:19,388 --> 00:16:21,975
Well, you're off

643
00:16:19,388 --> 00:16:21,975
to a good start.

644
00:16:26,104 --> 00:16:27,480
Thank you for meeting us.

645
00:16:27,522 --> 00:16:29,149
No problem.

646
00:16:29,190 --> 00:16:31,109
We never say no when someone

647
00:16:29,190 --> 00:16:31,109
wants to buy us lunch.

648
00:16:31,151 --> 00:16:33,653
We didn't say we were

649
00:16:31,151 --> 00:16:33,653
going to buy you lunch.

650
00:16:33,695 --> 00:16:35,655
Really? Apologies go down easier

651
00:16:35,697 --> 00:16:37,907
with free

652
00:16:35,697 --> 00:16:37,907
turkey club sandwiches.

653
00:16:39,034 --> 00:16:41,911
This isn't another apology.

654
00:16:41,953 --> 00:16:43,371
There's something

655
00:16:41,953 --> 00:16:43,371
we have to give you.

656
00:16:43,412 --> 00:16:45,040
Yes.

657
00:16:45,081 --> 00:16:49,418
Uh, we have proof that you

658
00:16:45,081 --> 00:16:49,418
plagiarized your thesis.

659
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:51,921
It's why we invited you

660
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:51,921
to this lunch.

661
00:16:51,963 --> 00:16:53,673
(gasps)

662
00:16:51,963 --> 00:16:53,673
We invited them.

663
00:16:53,715 --> 00:16:57,010
That's the confusion

664
00:16:53,715 --> 00:16:57,010
over who's paying.

665
00:16:57,052 --> 00:16:58,970
Hold on, are you

666
00:16:57,052 --> 00:16:58,970
blackmailing us?

667
00:16:59,012 --> 00:17:00,680
No, the opposite.

668
00:17:01,764 --> 00:17:03,766
We're blackmailing you?

669
00:17:06,936 --> 00:17:09,230
How are you

670
00:17:06,936 --> 00:17:09,230
up for a Nobel?

671
00:17:09,271 --> 00:17:11,107
SHELDON:

672
00:17:09,271 --> 00:17:11,107
We're giving you this

673
00:17:11,149 --> 00:17:13,275
so that no one can

674
00:17:11,149 --> 00:17:13,275
use it against you,

675
00:17:13,317 --> 00:17:15,778
because we want to win

676
00:17:13,317 --> 00:17:15,778
on our own merits,

677
00:17:15,820 --> 00:17:17,572
not by tearing you down.

678
00:17:17,613 --> 00:17:19,908
So it's true?

679
00:17:17,613 --> 00:17:19,908
You really did this?

680
00:17:19,949 --> 00:17:21,242
It was years ago, and

681
00:17:19,949 --> 00:17:21,242
I was going through

682
00:17:21,283 --> 00:17:23,244
a very hard time.

683
00:17:21,283 --> 00:17:23,244
What hard time?

684
00:17:23,285 --> 00:17:26,247
I had to write a thesis, and

685
00:17:23,285 --> 00:17:26,247
I wasn't smart enough to do it.

686
00:17:28,416 --> 00:17:30,710
You realize my name

687
00:17:28,416 --> 00:17:30,710
is attached to yours.

688
00:17:30,752 --> 00:17:32,712
If this gets out,

689
00:17:30,752 --> 00:17:32,712
it ruins me, too.

690
00:17:32,754 --> 00:17:34,463
It's not gonna get out.

691
00:17:34,505 --> 00:17:35,840
(scoffs) You know what?

692
00:17:34,505 --> 00:17:35,840
Linda was right.

693
00:17:35,882 --> 00:17:37,425
You're always

694
00:17:35,882 --> 00:17:37,425
looking for shortcuts.

695
00:17:37,466 --> 00:17:39,427
When did you talk

696
00:17:37,466 --> 00:17:39,427
to my ex-wife?

697
00:17:39,468 --> 00:17:41,054
She's not your ex-wife.

698
00:17:41,096 --> 00:17:42,847
You keep dragging your feet

699
00:17:41,096 --> 00:17:42,847
on those papers.

700
00:17:42,889 --> 00:17:45,892
Well, I'm trying to

701
00:17:42,889 --> 00:17:45,892
get the lake house.

702
00:17:45,934 --> 00:17:47,435
You're not getting

703
00:17:45,934 --> 00:17:47,435
the lake house.

704
00:17:47,476 --> 00:17:49,104
You're never

705
00:17:47,476 --> 00:17:49,104
getting the lake house.

706
00:17:49,145 --> 00:17:50,605
She picked it out,

707
00:17:49,145 --> 00:17:50,605
she decorated it.

708
00:17:50,646 --> 00:17:52,190
The lake house is hers.

709
00:17:52,232 --> 00:17:53,942
What is going on here?

710
00:17:53,983 --> 00:17:56,277
I'm in love with Linda!

711
00:17:58,446 --> 00:18:00,949
You son of a bitch!

712
00:18:06,246 --> 00:18:07,747
(both grunting)

713
00:18:09,999 --> 00:18:12,418
That was my iced tea.

714
00:18:16,965 --> 00:18:18,758
(slurring):

715
00:18:16,965 --> 00:18:18,758
Dr. Cooper, Dr. Fowler.

716
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:20,843
Just the guy I want to see.

717
00:18:20,885 --> 00:18:23,345
Are you drunk?

718
00:18:23,387 --> 00:18:26,307
I was, and then I still was.

719
00:18:26,348 --> 00:18:29,102
And now, I still was.

720
00:18:29,144 --> 00:18:31,854
Okay, can we help you?

721
00:18:31,896 --> 00:18:33,815
Pemberton is out.

722
00:18:33,856 --> 00:18:35,399
Someone published

723
00:18:33,856 --> 00:18:35,399
all the information

724
00:18:35,441 --> 00:18:36,859
about his plagiarism.

725
00:18:36,901 --> 00:18:38,278
(whispers):

726
00:18:36,901 --> 00:18:38,278
It was me.

727
00:18:40,613 --> 00:18:42,782
Someone else told Fermilab,

728
00:18:40,613 --> 00:18:42,782
and he lost his job.

729
00:18:42,824 --> 00:18:44,284
(whispers):

730
00:18:42,824 --> 00:18:44,284
Also me.

731
00:18:44,325 --> 00:18:45,868
And someone is

732
00:18:45,910 --> 00:18:49,914
sleeping with his ex-wife

733
00:18:45,910 --> 00:18:49,914
and it's not me.

734
00:18:49,956 --> 00:18:52,167
I thought it was.

735
00:18:52,208 --> 00:18:54,627
Not anymore. Apparently,

736
00:18:52,208 --> 00:18:54,627
just because I'm better

737
00:18:54,669 --> 00:18:57,797
than her husband doesn't mean

738
00:18:54,669 --> 00:18:57,797
I'm as good as her contractor.

739
00:18:59,423 --> 00:19:01,717
Women, huh?

740
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:03,178
I-I think you

741
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:03,178
need to go.

742
00:19:03,219 --> 00:19:05,263
No, wait.

743
00:19:03,219 --> 00:19:05,263
Hear me out.

744
00:19:05,305 --> 00:19:06,931
Look, the three of us

745
00:19:05,305 --> 00:19:06,931
could team up.

746
00:19:06,973 --> 00:19:08,057
There's one

747
00:19:06,973 --> 00:19:08,057
small catch.

748
00:19:08,099 --> 00:19:09,475
Dr. Pemberton

749
00:19:08,099 --> 00:19:09,475
has been saying

750
00:19:09,517 --> 00:19:11,644
a lot of bad stuff about me.

751
00:19:11,686 --> 00:19:14,147
But don't worry, I couldn't

752
00:19:11,686 --> 00:19:14,147
possibly have done any of it,

753
00:19:14,189 --> 00:19:16,232
because I was with you guys

754
00:19:14,189 --> 00:19:16,232
the whole time.

755
00:19:16,274 --> 00:19:17,525
(whispers):

756
00:19:16,274 --> 00:19:17,525
I did it.

757
00:19:21,237 --> 00:19:22,989
(stammers) Frankly,

758
00:19:21,237 --> 00:19:22,989
I don't know what Linda

759
00:19:23,031 --> 00:19:24,448
ever saw in either of them.
