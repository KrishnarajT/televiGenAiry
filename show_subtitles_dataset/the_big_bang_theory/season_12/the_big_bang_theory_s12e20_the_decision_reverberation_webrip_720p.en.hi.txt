1
00:00:03,049 --> 00:00:04,981
Oh, the... there's
a 7:15 at the ArcLight.

2
00:00:05,401 --> 00:00:06,946
Well, that doesn't give
us much time to eat.

3
00:00:06,970 --> 00:00:08,135
We can eat afterwards.

4
00:00:08,204 --> 00:00:10,071
I'm not gonna eat
at 10:00 at night.

5
00:00:10,139 --> 00:00:11,440
Who am I, Hemingway?

6
00:00:13,042 --> 00:00:15,209
Why do you think
Hemingway ate at 10:00?

7
00:00:15,279 --> 00:00:17,446
He spent a lot of time in
Spain. They eat dinner late.

8
00:00:17,514 --> 00:00:19,281
He also spent
a lot of time in Florida.

9
00:00:19,348 --> 00:00:20,894
Last time I was there,
people were eating dinner

10
00:00:20,918 --> 00:00:22,784
at, like, 4:30.

11
00:00:22,853 --> 00:00:24,118
You guys know

12
00:00:24,188 --> 00:00:26,888
that Hemingway had
cats with six toes?

13
00:00:28,025 --> 00:00:31,126
Six toes per foot
or six toes total?

14
00:00:31,194 --> 00:00:32,594
Okay.

15
00:00:32,662 --> 00:00:34,742
It's official. We're never
going to see the Avengers.

16
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:37,332
Guys, just come on.
Make a decision.

17
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:38,933
I-I'm good with
eating after.

18
00:00:39,001 --> 00:00:41,503
- Mm, I'm kind of hungry now.
- Yeah, me, too.

19
00:00:41,571 --> 00:00:43,016
- Then we'll eat before.
- Okay.

20
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:45,973
So, then, we can see the 3-D
at 9:00 or the 2-D at 9:30.

21
00:00:46,043 --> 00:00:47,641
3-D.
If I'm gonna see Thor,

22
00:00:47,711 --> 00:00:50,311
I want to feel like
I could lick those abs.

23
00:00:51,647 --> 00:00:53,781
Actually,
3-D kind of makes me queasy.

24
00:00:53,851 --> 00:00:55,250
No, but we have to see it
in 3-D.

25
00:00:55,318 --> 00:00:57,519
We saw part one in 3-D,
and the 2-D part two

26
00:00:57,588 --> 00:00:59,588
is not the part two
of the 3-D part one.

27
00:01:01,058 --> 00:01:02,891
He's got you there, Leonard.
Or he doesn't.

28
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:04,792
I don't really care anymore.

29
00:01:04,861 --> 00:01:05,926
Okay, then,

30
00:01:05,995 --> 00:01:07,272
- we'll go see it in 3-D.
- No.

31
00:01:07,296 --> 00:01:09,308
Sweetie, you shouldn't do things
that make you feel bad.

32
00:01:09,333 --> 00:01:11,766
Well, I'm doing this.

33
00:01:11,834 --> 00:01:13,167
And of course he is.

34
00:01:13,236 --> 00:01:15,137
He is a textbook satisficer.

35
00:01:15,205 --> 00:01:16,537
That's not even a word.

36
00:01:16,607 --> 00:01:17,772
Uh, yes, it is.

37
00:01:17,807 --> 00:01:20,208
According to Nobel Prize-winning
economist Herbert Simon,

38
00:01:20,277 --> 00:01:22,209
satisficing is a
decision-making strategy

39
00:01:22,278 --> 00:01:23,677
whereby a person accepts

40
00:01:23,747 --> 00:01:26,114
whatever available
option is satisfactory

41
00:01:26,182 --> 00:01:27,626
rather than seeking out
a course of action

42
00:01:27,650 --> 00:01:28,917
that would make him happiest,

43
00:01:28,985 --> 00:01:31,453
as I just did when I explained
what satisficing was.

44
00:01:32,522 --> 00:01:33,754
He's right.

45
00:01:33,790 --> 00:01:35,090
No one wanted to hear at.

46
00:01:35,158 --> 00:01:36,858
He knew it, yet
he plowed ahead.

47
00:01:38,095 --> 00:01:39,894
I'm just trying to find a plan

48
00:01:39,962 --> 00:01:41,196
that makes everyone happy.

49
00:01:41,265 --> 00:01:42,464
Except you.

50
00:01:42,533 --> 00:01:44,466
Yeah, Leonard.
What would make you happy?

51
00:01:44,534 --> 00:01:46,668
I could tell you about
satisficing again.

52
00:01:46,736 --> 00:01:47,947
You know,
what would make me happy

53
00:01:47,971 --> 00:01:49,537
is if we just stop talking
about this

54
00:01:49,605 --> 00:01:50,917
and see whatever movie
you guys want to see

55
00:01:50,941 --> 00:01:52,050
whenever you want to see it.

56
00:01:52,074 --> 00:01:53,878
Okay. But next time,
we get to pick.

67
00:02:24,388 --> 00:02:25,632
How's your headache?

68
00:02:25,633 --> 00:02:28,234
It's better.
The throwing up really helped.

69
00:02:28,302 --> 00:02:32,104
Mm. I'm so sorry you missed
the end of the movie.

70
00:02:32,173 --> 00:02:33,339
Oh, it's okay.

71
00:02:33,408 --> 00:02:35,540
Everyone talked about it
so much on the ride home,

72
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:37,810
I feel like I saw it.

73
00:02:37,878 --> 00:02:40,212
Well, to be fair, you talked
about the bathroom so much,

74
00:02:40,281 --> 00:02:42,482
we felt like we saw that, too.

75
00:02:43,651 --> 00:02:44,817
I think I would've been okay

76
00:02:44,885 --> 00:02:46,352
if we weren't sitting so close.

77
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:48,187
Well, then,
why did we sit so close?

78
00:02:48,256 --> 00:02:50,323
Sheldon said, "Are these seats
good for everyone?"

79
00:02:50,391 --> 00:02:53,626
What was I supposed to do,
say no, like a maniac? -

80
00:02:53,694 --> 00:02:55,861
Sweetie, you have
got to stand up for yourself.

81
00:02:55,930 --> 00:02:57,108
You know, maybe Sheldon's right.

82
00:02:57,132 --> 00:02:59,164
Maybe you are that word he said.

83
00:02:59,233 --> 00:03:00,466
Satisficer?

84
00:03:00,534 --> 00:03:01,700
Yeah, that!
That's the one.

85
00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:04,437
Boy, sounds way more made-up
when you say it.

86
00:03:05,407 --> 00:03:06,716
I mean, come on,
when was the last time

87
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:08,419
you did something
totally selfish without worrying

88
00:03:08,442 --> 00:03:09,586
about what anyone else wanted?

89
00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:10,710
Uh...

90
00:03:10,778 --> 00:03:12,043
according to my mother,

91
00:03:12,113 --> 00:03:14,280
I took my sweet time being born.

92
00:03:17,352 --> 00:03:19,085
How is that selfish?

93
00:03:19,153 --> 00:03:22,354
Apparently, she had
dinner reservations.

94
00:03:24,992 --> 00:03:26,959
And this is the telescope room

95
00:03:27,027 --> 00:03:29,394
where I spend a lot
of my evenings.

96
00:03:29,464 --> 00:03:31,129
Where's the telescope?

97
00:03:31,199 --> 00:03:32,865
Hawaii.

98
00:03:32,933 --> 00:03:34,199
That's cool.

99
00:03:34,269 --> 00:03:36,034
Yeah, so, you know...

100
00:03:36,103 --> 00:03:37,537
aloha.

101
00:03:40,442 --> 00:03:42,507
What's that smell?

102
00:03:42,577 --> 00:03:44,644
Uh, everyone has
their own theory.

103
00:03:44,711 --> 00:03:46,245
Dr. Tibourgh thinks it's mold.

104
00:03:46,313 --> 00:03:48,114
I think it's Dr. Tibourgh.

105
00:03:49,483 --> 00:03:51,417
So, what am I looking at?

106
00:03:51,485 --> 00:03:53,853
Ah, this is live information

107
00:03:53,921 --> 00:03:55,854
from the Keck telescope.
It's pretty interesting.

108
00:03:55,924 --> 00:03:58,757
So, I recently observed
some optical flashes.

109
00:03:58,827 --> 00:04:01,026
It could be light bouncing
off a natural object,

110
00:04:01,095 --> 00:04:02,306
but those tend to
be less reflective,

111
00:04:02,329 --> 00:04:04,296
so could be evidence of
something alien-made.

112
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:07,532
Oh, this suddenly got exciting.

113
00:04:07,602 --> 00:04:09,335
Oh. When you say "exciting,"

114
00:04:09,403 --> 00:04:10,948
do you mean "go back
to my place" exciting

115
00:04:10,972 --> 00:04:12,604
or "hold our breath
and do it here"?

116
00:04:16,211 --> 00:04:18,144
Mahalo.

117
00:04:25,687 --> 00:04:27,620
Do I want to ask?

118
00:04:28,690 --> 00:04:30,622
Oh, w... when I go upstairs,

119
00:04:30,692 --> 00:04:33,024
Penny's gonna make me choose
what we're gonna do tonight

120
00:04:33,093 --> 00:04:35,026
without taking her feelings
into consideration,

121
00:04:35,096 --> 00:04:37,028
and I-I don't know
if I'm up for it.

122
00:04:39,033 --> 00:04:40,966
Poor baby.
When I go upstairs,

123
00:04:41,035 --> 00:04:42,868
Sheldon's gonna give me
a 25-minute lecture

124
00:04:42,937 --> 00:04:45,971
about what Hulk would be like
if he were made of metal.

125
00:04:47,341 --> 00:04:48,673
Part of his ongoing series,

126
00:04:48,742 --> 00:04:51,743
"What If Hulk Were Made
of Other Things?"

127
00:04:51,812 --> 00:04:54,546
I-I've always been
a people pleaser.

128
00:04:54,615 --> 00:04:57,083
Is that so bad?
It's gotten me this far.

129
00:04:57,151 --> 00:04:59,819
What, almost up four
flights of stairs?

130
00:05:00,889 --> 00:05:02,889
Okay, if I go in there

131
00:05:02,956 --> 00:05:05,725
and pick something I want to do
that she also wants to do,

132
00:05:05,793 --> 00:05:07,605
she's gonna think I'm just
picking it to make her happy.

133
00:05:07,629 --> 00:05:09,127
So I feel like

134
00:05:09,197 --> 00:05:11,307
I have to pick something
I know she doesn't want to do

135
00:05:11,331 --> 00:05:12,572
or she's gonna be disappointed.

136
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:13,932
Right?
What do you think?

137
00:05:14,002 --> 00:05:16,235
Think I've got ice cream
in this bag

138
00:05:16,303 --> 00:05:17,569
that's starting to melt.

139
00:05:18,673 --> 00:05:19,872
I'm sorry.

140
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:22,307
It's exhausting
being in my head.

141
00:05:22,377 --> 00:05:24,944
Look, when you wanted
Penny, you didn't care

142
00:05:25,012 --> 00:05:27,379
what anybody else
thought or wanted,

143
00:05:27,447 --> 00:05:28,781
including Penny.

144
00:05:30,851 --> 00:05:33,118
That's true.

145
00:05:33,187 --> 00:05:35,387
Yeah, yeah,
there was something I wanted,

146
00:05:35,456 --> 00:05:38,123
I went after it and I got it.

147
00:05:38,192 --> 00:05:40,632
Now you're hiding from it on the
stairs, so it all worked out.

148
00:05:43,397 --> 00:05:44,896
Hey.

149
00:05:44,966 --> 00:05:46,377
I thought about what
I want to do tonight,

150
00:05:46,401 --> 00:05:49,168
and I didn't take your feelings
into consideration at all.

151
00:05:50,238 --> 00:05:51,637
Great.

152
00:05:51,706 --> 00:05:53,171
I want to have sex.

153
00:05:54,242 --> 00:05:56,776
Wow, sex with your wife.

154
00:05:56,843 --> 00:05:59,978
You're really swinging for
the fences there, Hofstadter.

155
00:06:00,048 --> 00:06:01,714
Yeah, we don't have to.

156
00:06:01,783 --> 00:06:02,915
No!

157
00:06:02,983 --> 00:06:04,250
I like it.
Let's go.

158
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:05,718
Oh, o-okay.

159
00:06:05,786 --> 00:06:07,197
And then after that,
we're gonna watch

160
00:06:07,221 --> 00:06:08,553
Star Trek: Discovery.
- All right.

161
00:06:08,622 --> 00:06:11,389
Well, just a warning, I might be
on my phone for most of it.

162
00:06:11,459 --> 00:06:13,192
That's fine.

163
00:06:13,261 --> 00:06:14,605
Wait, you mean
just the Star Trek...

164
00:06:14,629 --> 00:06:16,661
Actually, I don't care.

165
00:06:19,067 --> 00:06:21,466
And, with apologies
to Lady Gaga,

166
00:06:21,536 --> 00:06:24,002
that's how a star is born.

167
00:06:25,906 --> 00:06:28,608
Told you he was
gonna mention Lady Gaga.

168
00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:31,951
At least he didn't talk
about how much he cried

169
00:06:32,012 --> 00:06:33,245
during that movie.

170
00:06:33,314 --> 00:06:34,579
Although,

171
00:06:34,649 --> 00:06:36,259
if you haven't seen that movie,
you should.

172
00:06:36,283 --> 00:06:38,184
I cried so much.

173
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,653
Well, that's the lecture
for today.

174
00:06:41,723 --> 00:06:43,555
Uh, let's open it up
for questions.

175
00:06:43,625 --> 00:06:45,824
Uh...

176
00:06:46,728 --> 00:06:48,226
Oh, you! Sir, yes.

177
00:06:48,295 --> 00:06:49,362
You have a question?

178
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:52,230
Yeah. Actually,
I have a two-part question.

179
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:55,067
Are you sure? I get the sense
it's only one part.

180
00:06:56,137 --> 00:06:57,702
No, no, it's two.

181
00:06:57,771 --> 00:06:59,671
Part one: the new star

182
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:00,805
you were talking about—

183
00:07:00,875 --> 00:07:03,041
how long did it take
that light to reach Earth?

184
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:04,410
And part two:

185
00:07:04,478 --> 00:07:05,956
is it true you plant
your friends in the audience

186
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:08,047
to ask questions?

187
00:07:08,115 --> 00:07:10,048
46,000 years.

188
00:07:10,117 --> 00:07:11,483
And no,
I don't plant my friends,

189
00:07:11,552 --> 00:07:13,918
because apparently,
I don't have any.

190
00:07:15,690 --> 00:07:17,055
Uh, any other questions?

191
00:07:17,125 --> 00:07:19,591
- Uh, yes. You, miss.
- Hi.

192
00:07:19,661 --> 00:07:21,961
I read your paper on specular
reflections. It was great.

193
00:07:22,029 --> 00:07:23,829
- Oh, thank you so much.
- In your conclusion,

194
00:07:23,865 --> 00:07:26,232
you said you couldn't rule out
that light flashes

195
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:28,466
could be evidence
of alien civilization.

196
00:07:28,536 --> 00:07:31,569
So does that mean
you think it's aliens?

197
00:07:31,605 --> 00:07:33,839
I was just illustrating
that there are many unknowns,

198
00:07:33,908 --> 00:07:35,307
and as scientists, we can't

199
00:07:35,375 --> 00:07:37,175
preemptively rule out
possibilities.

200
00:07:37,245 --> 00:07:39,278
So you think it's aliens.

201
00:07:39,346 --> 00:07:41,546
- A-Actually, no, that's...
- I have a question

202
00:07:41,615 --> 00:07:43,716
about the aliens you found.

203
00:07:43,785 --> 00:07:46,084
That's not what I said, Howard.

204
00:07:46,153 --> 00:07:47,752
Hold on a second.

205
00:07:47,822 --> 00:07:50,656
Do you two know each other?

206
00:07:50,724 --> 00:07:52,091
Yeah.

207
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,291
My sister was—

208
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:56,327
a-and this is her term—
abducted.

209
00:07:57,932 --> 00:08:01,000
Do you think those could be
the same aliens...

210
00:08:01,069 --> 00:08:03,502
Okay, any other questions? Mm.

211
00:08:03,570 --> 00:08:04,603
Not about aliens?

212
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:07,740
What?

213
00:08:07,809 --> 00:08:09,653
Do you still want me to
ask the one you gave me?

214
00:08:09,677 --> 00:08:12,110
'Cause it kind of feels
like we're past that.

215
00:08:14,915 --> 00:08:16,982
Ooh, Leonard,
I don't mean to alarm you,

216
00:08:17,050 --> 00:08:19,485
but the Chinese food
smells funny.

217
00:08:19,553 --> 00:08:21,219
That's because it's barbecue.

218
00:08:22,290 --> 00:08:24,857
But it's Chinese food night.

219
00:08:24,925 --> 00:08:26,370
Um, I picked it. You're
the one who told me

220
00:08:26,394 --> 00:08:28,526
to stop being such a
satisficer all the time.

221
00:08:28,596 --> 00:08:30,028
What?
I did not.

222
00:08:30,098 --> 00:08:31,863
I just pointed out
that you were one.

223
00:08:31,932 --> 00:08:34,132
It's what I like best about you.

224
00:08:34,201 --> 00:08:37,136
Well, that and those little
notes you leave in my lunch.

225
00:08:38,539 --> 00:08:40,473
I leave those!

226
00:08:41,909 --> 00:08:43,508
Well, that's disappointing.

227
00:08:43,578 --> 00:08:44,588
I already know
that you heart me.

228
00:08:44,612 --> 00:08:46,911
Now I don't know
if Leonard does.

229
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:48,747
Well, this is what
we're having for dinner.

230
00:08:48,815 --> 00:08:50,949
You can eat it or not.
I don't care.

231
00:08:51,017 --> 00:08:53,051
I guess that answers
the heart question.

232
00:08:53,121 --> 00:08:55,588
I-It's fine.
We'll have barbecue.

233
00:08:55,656 --> 00:08:58,223
Oh, of course.
I'm nothing if not flexible.

234
00:08:58,291 --> 00:09:00,291
I'm sure that at some point

235
00:09:00,361 --> 00:09:02,728
in the 3,000-year history
of the Chinese empire,

236
00:09:02,796 --> 00:09:04,630
a cavalryman crossing

237
00:09:04,699 --> 00:09:07,565
the Gobi Desert was forced
by hunger to eat his own horse

238
00:09:07,635 --> 00:09:08,712
and roast it over a campfire,

239
00:09:08,736 --> 00:09:10,935
hence, Chinese barbecue.
Let's eat.

240
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:15,974
Gee, I'm sorry, I didn't
watch the news today.

241
00:09:16,042 --> 00:09:18,544
Has the whole world gone mad?

242
00:09:18,613 --> 00:09:20,278
It's my house.

243
00:09:20,348 --> 00:09:23,148
I'm tired of being told
where I can and can't sit.

244
00:09:24,886 --> 00:09:27,185
You did this.

245
00:09:27,255 --> 00:09:29,155
Amy, grab your meat.
We're leaving in a huff.

246
00:09:32,093 --> 00:09:34,160
I'm sorry, if I don't go now,
it's not a huff.

247
00:09:37,364 --> 00:09:39,464
Don't take this the wrong way,

248
00:09:39,534 --> 00:09:41,934
but that was even more exciting
than the sex.

249
00:09:43,337 --> 00:09:46,338
Don't take this the wrong way,
but yes, it was.

250
00:09:55,665 --> 00:09:56,954
Leonard, where are you going?

251
00:09:56,954 --> 00:09:58,186
Well, to work.

252
00:09:58,256 --> 00:09:59,789
Just trying out
a different route.

253
00:09:59,858 --> 00:10:01,290
Okay.

254
00:10:01,358 --> 00:10:04,893
If we cross the county line,
it's technically kidnapping.

255
00:10:04,963 --> 00:10:07,796
Well, if you don't approve
of my driving, too bad.

256
00:10:07,866 --> 00:10:09,431
This is the new me.
Get used to it.

257
00:10:09,499 --> 00:10:11,499
Fine.
Then this is the new me,

258
00:10:11,569 --> 00:10:13,669
and he finds
the new you tiresome.

259
00:10:15,239 --> 00:10:17,172
How is that different
than the old you?

260
00:10:17,242 --> 00:10:19,275
The new me gives knowing winks.

261
00:10:22,313 --> 00:10:23,713
Well, all these years,

262
00:10:23,781 --> 00:10:26,047
I-I was afraid to say
what I wanted.

263
00:10:26,117 --> 00:10:27,650
You know, even at work,

264
00:10:27,718 --> 00:10:29,518
you know, there's things
I want to accomplish,

265
00:10:29,554 --> 00:10:32,655
but I didn't want to ruffle any
feathers or step on any toes.

266
00:10:32,723 --> 00:10:34,656
Feathers and toes?
Is the new thing you're trying

267
00:10:34,726 --> 00:10:37,392
to accomplish ballroom dancing
with a chicken?

268
00:10:37,462 --> 00:10:40,463
Look at that—
the new me is hilarious.

269
00:10:40,531 --> 00:10:42,931
Always wanted to be
the principal investigator

270
00:10:43,001 --> 00:10:45,200
on a plasma physics study.

271
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:48,036
Hey, look at that—
the new you's funny, too.

272
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:51,339
I'm serious.
You know...

273
00:10:51,409 --> 00:10:52,909
I'm gonna put together
a proposal

274
00:10:52,977 --> 00:10:55,056
and tell President Siebert
this is what I want to do.

275
00:10:55,113 --> 00:10:56,278
If he doesn't let me,

276
00:10:56,347 --> 00:10:58,381
there's plenty of other
universities that will.

277
00:10:58,449 --> 00:11:00,149
Sure there are.

278
00:11:02,453 --> 00:11:04,387
Of course you don't
want me to do that,

279
00:11:04,454 --> 00:11:06,016
because you like it when
you're successful and I'm not.

280
00:11:06,017 --> 00:11:08,223
No, you're confusing
causation and...

281
00:11:08,292 --> 00:11:10,959
"Welcome to Alhambra."
Where the heck are we?

282
00:11:13,698 --> 00:11:15,830
Now I'm some sort
of big joke.

283
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:18,534
I'm even on some
alien conspiracy blog.

284
00:11:18,569 --> 00:11:20,636
See? "Caltech
astrophysicist

285
00:11:20,704 --> 00:11:22,805
finds proof of alien life"

286
00:11:24,374 --> 00:11:26,641
Wow, that is not
a great picture of you.

287
00:11:26,710 --> 00:11:28,209
That's not the point.

288
00:11:28,278 --> 00:11:29,578
Dr. Koothrappali.

289
00:11:29,646 --> 00:11:32,180
I'm surprised to see you in here.
Why is that?

290
00:11:32,249 --> 00:11:33,415
Because the truth...

291
00:11:33,483 --> 00:11:35,417
is out there!

292
00:11:37,722 --> 00:11:39,888
You see? That's what
I'm talking about.

293
00:11:39,958 --> 00:11:41,891
People have been doing
that to me all day.

294
00:11:41,959 --> 00:11:43,726
Relax.
They're just having fun.

295
00:11:46,229 --> 00:11:48,164
Oh, come on!

296
00:11:50,601 --> 00:11:51,601
See? It's fun.

297
00:11:59,310 --> 00:12:00,810
Wow. Déjà vu.

298
00:12:01,912 --> 00:12:03,545
Amy, you're a neuroscientist—

299
00:12:03,613 --> 00:12:05,747
you know the latest research
into déjà vu suggests

300
00:12:05,816 --> 00:12:08,050
it's nothing but
the frontal regions of the brain

301
00:12:08,118 --> 00:12:10,151
attempting to correct
an inaccurate memory.

302
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:12,188
You telling me stuff
I already know

303
00:12:12,256 --> 00:12:13,922
is definitely déjà vu.

304
00:12:15,193 --> 00:12:17,392
How about telling me
something I don't know,

305
00:12:17,462 --> 00:12:20,128
like why you're
sitting on the stairs.

306
00:12:20,198 --> 00:12:23,098
How can I tell if I'm doing
something for a noble reason

307
00:12:23,166 --> 00:12:24,599
or a selfish reason?

308
00:12:25,737 --> 00:12:27,770
Try saying the thing
in your head

309
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:31,306
and see if you can add
the words, "That'll show 'em."

310
00:12:32,877 --> 00:12:34,810
Leonard's about to demand a job

311
00:12:34,878 --> 00:12:37,479
that I don't think
the university will give him.

312
00:12:37,547 --> 00:12:39,681
I'm worried he's making
a giant mistake.

313
00:12:39,751 --> 00:12:41,684
But maybe I only
think that because

314
00:12:41,752 --> 00:12:44,553
deep down I don't
want him to succeed.

315
00:12:45,957 --> 00:12:48,457
The fact that you're worried
about your motivation

316
00:12:48,526 --> 00:12:51,960
supports the idea that you
genuinely care for your friend.

317
00:12:54,364 --> 00:12:56,632
I do.

318
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:58,367
Thank you, Amy.

319
00:12:58,435 --> 00:12:59,568
You know what?

320
00:12:59,637 --> 00:13:01,237
After I've talked to Leonard,

321
00:13:01,305 --> 00:13:03,906
you've earned yourself
a bonus lecture on Sponge Hulk.

322
00:13:07,512 --> 00:13:08,710
That'll show me.

323
00:13:12,749 --> 00:13:15,450
So, I spent the whole day
putting together this proposal,

324
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:17,685
and tomorrow I'm gonna
tell President Siebert

325
00:13:17,755 --> 00:13:19,854
that this is what
I want to do.

326
00:13:19,924 --> 00:13:22,525
Oh. Well, this...

327
00:13:22,593 --> 00:13:25,227
looks great.

328
00:13:25,295 --> 00:13:27,595
- You didn't even open it.
- Well, no,

329
00:13:27,665 --> 00:13:28,830
it's got a nice, you know,

330
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:31,166
science-y heft to it. I...

331
00:13:31,234 --> 00:13:32,867
Really proud of
you, sweetie.

332
00:13:34,037 --> 00:13:35,237
Leonard?

333
00:13:35,305 --> 00:13:36,638
- Hmm?
- Um,

334
00:13:36,707 --> 00:13:38,306
I have been agonizing

335
00:13:38,376 --> 00:13:40,476
over whether or not
to say something to you.

336
00:13:40,545 --> 00:13:42,411
Aw. Let me help. Don't.

337
00:13:43,513 --> 00:13:44,847
I have to.

338
00:13:44,915 --> 00:13:47,949
I don't think that you
should demand to be in charge

339
00:13:48,018 --> 00:13:49,351
of a plasma project.

340
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:50,518
Well, big surprise.

341
00:13:50,588 --> 00:13:53,289
You can't stand the idea
of me succeeding.

342
00:13:53,357 --> 00:13:54,790
No. I'll be honest.

343
00:13:54,858 --> 00:13:57,826
New assertive Leonard is going
to take some getting used to.

344
00:13:57,895 --> 00:14:00,563
But so did
cargo pants Leonard, hmm?

345
00:14:00,631 --> 00:14:02,531
Who, for the record,
I miss.

346
00:14:02,599 --> 00:14:05,166
He always had gum.

347
00:14:05,236 --> 00:14:07,536
Sheldon, if this is what he
wants, he should ask for it.

348
00:14:07,604 --> 00:14:09,637
I mean, what's the worst
that happens? They say no.

349
00:14:09,707 --> 00:14:11,372
Well, I'm not
gonna let them say no.

350
00:14:11,441 --> 00:14:14,410
If they don't want me to quit,
this is what it's gonna take.

351
00:14:14,478 --> 00:14:15,978
Wait, you're gonna quit?

352
00:14:16,046 --> 00:14:18,613
Yeah. It's like you said,
I have to go after what I want,

353
00:14:18,683 --> 00:14:20,315
and if I can't get that
at Caltech,

354
00:14:20,383 --> 00:14:22,424
there are plenty of other
universities in the world.

355
00:14:22,487 --> 00:14:23,986
W... In the world?

356
00:14:24,055 --> 00:14:25,854
I can't even get you
to go to the beach,

357
00:14:25,890 --> 00:14:28,623
and now you want to
move to the world?

358
00:14:28,693 --> 00:14:30,796
Well, I don't want to, but
if that's what I have to do...

359
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:31,728
Okay, don't you think

360
00:14:31,728 --> 00:14:33,073
threatening to quit
your job is something

361
00:14:33,097 --> 00:14:34,463
you should run by me first?

362
00:14:34,531 --> 00:14:36,699
You said I shouldn't
worry about your feelings.

363
00:14:36,766 --> 00:14:39,468
I meant feelings about things
that I don't care about!

364
00:14:39,536 --> 00:14:41,281
Now, I'm not quite sure
when to jump in here...

365
00:14:41,305 --> 00:14:43,171
- Not now.
- Okay.

366
00:14:43,241 --> 00:14:45,608
Fine, you want to talk about it?
Let's talk about it.

367
00:14:45,675 --> 00:14:47,609
I-I'm not loving
my job right now.

368
00:14:47,678 --> 00:14:49,559
And this is something
that would make me happy.

369
00:14:49,737 --> 00:14:50,790
Don't you want me to be happy?

370
00:14:50,815 --> 00:14:52,516
Oh, I've been dinged
on this before.

371
00:14:52,516 --> 00:14:55,251
Whatever you really think,
you have to say yes.

372
00:14:55,319 --> 00:14:58,720
- Of course I want you to be happy.
- Well played.

373
00:14:58,789 --> 00:15:01,523
Okay, I know this seems scary,

374
00:15:01,592 --> 00:15:03,892
but I put together
a strong proposal.

375
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:06,295
It's good for me,
it's good for the university.

376
00:15:06,363 --> 00:15:08,196
They're gonna give it to me.

377
00:15:08,266 --> 00:15:09,531
No.

378
00:15:11,268 --> 00:15:12,800
I'm sorry, President Siebert,

379
00:15:12,869 --> 00:15:15,036
but I'm not taking no
for an answer.

380
00:15:15,106 --> 00:15:16,704
I speak a little Russian.

381
00:15:16,773 --> 00:15:19,308
Will you take nyet
for an answer?

382
00:15:19,377 --> 00:15:21,109
I'm serious.

383
00:15:21,179 --> 00:15:23,311
Oh.
Well, that changes everything.

384
00:15:23,381 --> 00:15:25,314
- Really?
- Nyet.

385
00:15:28,252 --> 00:15:30,553
I know a lot of people
have been having fun

386
00:15:30,621 --> 00:15:32,755
claiming that I said
I found alien life.

387
00:15:32,823 --> 00:15:34,223
I want to make it clear

388
00:15:34,291 --> 00:15:36,959
that is not what I said.

389
00:15:37,027 --> 00:15:39,361
I did say that was
one possible explanation.

390
00:15:39,430 --> 00:15:41,363
I don't think
that's something to mock.

391
00:15:41,431 --> 00:15:43,899
Right? It would be arrogant
for us to assume

392
00:15:43,968 --> 00:15:46,167
that we are alone
in the universe.

393
00:15:46,237 --> 00:15:48,337
And as scientists,
we need to remain open

394
00:15:48,406 --> 00:15:51,172
to the possibility
that the truth may sound silly

395
00:15:51,242 --> 00:15:52,608
or far-fetched.

396
00:15:52,676 --> 00:15:55,511
Uh, the round Earth.
Germs that cause diseases.

397
00:15:55,579 --> 00:15:56,844
Subatomic particles.

398
00:15:56,914 --> 00:15:58,847
All these at one time
seemed fanciful.

399
00:15:58,915 --> 00:16:01,183
So who's to say
what science fiction of today

400
00:16:01,252 --> 00:16:03,084
will be the reality of tomorrow?

401
00:16:04,188 --> 00:16:06,521
Will there be colonies on Mars?

402
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:08,623
Uh, matter transporters?

403
00:16:08,693 --> 00:16:11,126
Perhaps the Loch Ness Monster
is real.

404
00:16:11,194 --> 00:16:13,762
Who knows?
I'm just saying that...

405
00:16:13,830 --> 00:16:16,265
the only way
science moves forward

406
00:16:16,334 --> 00:16:18,934
is to follow the evidence
wherever it leads,

407
00:16:19,002 --> 00:16:21,804
even if it makes us
sound crazy sometimes.

408
00:16:21,872 --> 00:16:23,539
Hey, Bernie,
look at this.

409
00:16:23,608 --> 00:16:26,374
"Caltech astrophysicist claims

410
00:16:26,444 --> 00:16:29,411
Loch Ness Monster is real."

411
00:16:34,218 --> 00:16:36,050
- Hey. How did it go?
- Great.

412
00:16:36,119 --> 00:16:37,386
What, so you got the job?

413
00:16:37,454 --> 00:16:39,488
I did not.

414
00:16:39,556 --> 00:16:41,723
So you quit?
Okay, Leonard, I can't move.

415
00:16:41,791 --> 00:16:44,627
I just bought a six-month
membership to SoulCycle.

416
00:16:45,729 --> 00:16:47,762
Well, I-I didn't quit.

417
00:16:47,832 --> 00:16:49,098
I said I was going to.

418
00:16:49,165 --> 00:16:51,532
I walked out the door
and started crying.

419
00:16:51,602 --> 00:16:55,137
You know, "Oh, my, God, oh, my
God, oh, my God, what'd I do?"

420
00:16:55,205 --> 00:16:57,473
And then he called me back in.

421
00:16:57,540 --> 00:16:59,108
Then he changed his mind?

422
00:16:59,175 --> 00:17:00,242
He did not.

423
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:02,243
I'm really confused about

424
00:17:02,313 --> 00:17:04,213
how to react to this story.

425
00:17:05,482 --> 00:17:07,783
President Siebert
didn't want to lose me.

426
00:17:07,852 --> 00:17:09,317
Even though
they couldn't make me

427
00:17:09,386 --> 00:17:11,687
a lead investigator
on a plasma team,

428
00:17:11,756 --> 00:17:13,689
there was an opening
for a co-lead

429
00:17:13,757 --> 00:17:15,291
on a photon entanglement team.

430
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:16,557
How cool is that?

431
00:17:16,626 --> 00:17:19,495
You're gonna have to tell me.

432
00:17:20,597 --> 00:17:22,064
It's really cool.

433
00:17:22,132 --> 00:17:24,533
Yay! Oh, I am so
happy for you.

434
00:17:24,602 --> 00:17:28,036
I almost got what I wanted,
and it never would have happened

435
00:17:28,104 --> 00:17:30,405
if you hadn't almost believed in me.
- Oh.

436
00:17:31,641 --> 00:17:33,542
Let's celebrate.
What do you want to do?

437
00:17:33,611 --> 00:17:36,312
Oh, please don't make me
decide another thing.

438
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:37,979
Hey, you want to go
to SoulCycle with me?

439
00:17:38,015 --> 00:17:40,248
Give me a minute,
I'll think of something.

440
00:17:45,969 --> 00:17:47,610
Now, I know what
You're you're thinking:

441
00:17:47,638 --> 00:17:51,305
isn't Broccoli Hulk basically
just the Jolly Green Giant?

442
00:17:52,375 --> 00:17:54,343
That is what I was thinking.

443
00:17:54,411 --> 00:17:56,711
Let's never discuss it again.

444
00:17:57,815 --> 00:17:58,881
Really?

445
00:18:00,116 --> 00:18:02,383
- Are you hiding from Penny again?
- No. No, no, no.

446
00:18:02,452 --> 00:18:05,920
I-I went to SoulCycle with her,
and my legs hurt so bad, I...

447
00:18:05,989 --> 00:18:08,524
literally can't stand up.

448
00:18:08,592 --> 00:18:11,159
Sheldon, why don't you
keep him company.

449
00:18:12,930 --> 00:18:14,363
All right.

450
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:18,366
Hello, Leonard.
Hey.

451
00:18:23,172 --> 00:18:25,039
Have you ever wondered

452
00:18:25,109 --> 00:18:28,576
what the Hulk would be like
if he were made of sherbet?

453
00:18:31,582 --> 00:18:33,148
I give up.

454
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:35,883
Delicious.
