00:00:09,376 --> 00:00:10,836
Previously on

2
00:00:09,376 --> 00:00:10,836
The Big Bang Theory...

3
00:00:10,878 --> 00:00:13,463
Uh, we sort of have another

4
00:00:10,878 --> 00:00:13,463
reason for asking you here.

5
00:00:14,631 --> 00:00:16,383
We want to have a baby,

6
00:00:16,425 --> 00:00:18,343
but we can't do it

7
00:00:16,425 --> 00:00:18,343
on our own.

8
00:00:18,385 --> 00:00:19,344
Okay, whoa, whoa.

9
00:00:19,386 --> 00:00:20,679
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

10
00:00:20,721 --> 00:00:22,389
Yeah, this has been

11
00:00:20,721 --> 00:00:22,389
such a nice evening.

12
00:00:22,431 --> 00:00:25,267
Let's all just stop before

13
00:00:22,431 --> 00:00:25,267
anyone says any more things.

14
00:00:25,308 --> 00:00:26,769
Leonard, would you be

15
00:00:25,308 --> 00:00:26,769
the father of our baby?

16
00:00:26,810 --> 00:00:28,854
Oh, you said a thing.

17
00:00:30,898 --> 00:00:33,734
Thank you, guys, again

18
00:00:30,898 --> 00:00:33,734
for agreeing to do this.

19
00:00:33,776 --> 00:00:35,986
Yeah, it means

20
00:00:33,776 --> 00:00:35,986
so much to us.

21
00:00:36,028 --> 00:00:37,696
Ah, we're happy

22
00:00:36,028 --> 00:00:37,696
we can help.

23
00:00:37,738 --> 00:00:40,365
Yeah, and we don't find it

24
00:00:37,738 --> 00:00:40,365
weird at all.

25
00:00:40,407 --> 00:00:42,034
It's a little weird

26
00:00:40,407 --> 00:00:42,034
for us, too.

27
00:00:42,076 --> 00:00:44,203
I mean, instead of our baby

28
00:00:42,076 --> 00:00:44,203
looking like Zack,

29
00:00:44,245 --> 00:00:46,538
it's gonna look

30
00:00:44,245 --> 00:00:46,538
like Leonard.

31
00:00:47,539 --> 00:00:49,750
Or Penny if it's a girl.

32
00:00:51,835 --> 00:00:53,378
No, no, it's not gonna look...

33
00:00:54,379 --> 00:00:56,423
Sure.

34
00:00:57,382 --> 00:00:58,801
But I promise,

35
00:00:58,842 --> 00:01:01,470
we're gonna be

36
00:00:58,842 --> 00:01:01,470
really good parents.

37
00:00:58,842 --> 00:01:01,470
Mm-hmm.

38
00:01:01,511 --> 00:01:02,930
Oh, we know you will.

39
00:01:02,972 --> 00:01:04,598
So, what is the next step?

40
00:01:02,972 --> 00:01:04,598
Yeah.

41
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,850
Well, Leonard, we were hoping

42
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,850
you'd go in on Monday.

43
00:01:06,892 --> 00:01:08,018
Okay.

44
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:09,478
And they say,

45
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:09,478
for the best results,

46
00:01:09,519 --> 00:01:10,813
between now and then,

47
00:01:09,519 --> 00:01:10,813
you shouldn't have sex.

48
00:01:10,854 --> 00:01:12,439
ZACK:

49
00:01:10,854 --> 00:01:12,439
Sorry, bro,

50
00:01:12,481 --> 00:01:14,984
I know it seems impossible

51
00:01:12,481 --> 00:01:14,984
to go for five days without,

52
00:01:15,025 --> 00:01:17,444
but I believe in you.

53
00:01:17,486 --> 00:01:20,572
Five days?

54
00:01:17,486 --> 00:01:20,572
My record is 24 years.

55
00:01:22,241 --> 00:01:24,409
Uh, I think that also means

56
00:01:22,241 --> 00:01:24,409
no flying solo.

57
00:01:24,451 --> 00:01:25,410
Oh.

58
00:01:25,452 --> 00:01:28,914
Then my record is 14 years.

59
00:01:28,956 --> 00:01:31,208
And, well, we're really

60
00:01:28,956 --> 00:01:31,208
hoping for a son.

61
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:33,543
So just, like, keep that in mind

62
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:33,543
when you're in there.

63
00:01:33,585 --> 00:01:37,506
Yeah, just think, "Little

64
00:01:33,585 --> 00:01:37,506
boys, little boys."

65
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:42,636
Still just

66
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:42,636
totally not weird.

67
00:01:42,678 --> 00:01:44,387
Hello.

68
00:01:44,429 --> 00:01:46,389
Oh, hey, Sheldon. We're kind of

69
00:01:44,429 --> 00:01:46,389
in the middle of something.

70
00:01:46,431 --> 00:01:48,642
Oh, I won't be a moment.

71
00:01:46,431 --> 00:01:48,642
I just need to grab a book

72
00:01:48,684 --> 00:01:50,186
off a high shelf, which I can do

73
00:01:50,227 --> 00:01:52,604
because I am both

74
00:01:50,227 --> 00:01:52,604
tall and smart.

75
00:01:54,397 --> 00:01:56,317
Sheldon, come home!

76
00:01:56,358 --> 00:01:58,944
They don't want

77
00:01:56,358 --> 00:01:58,944
to have your baby!

78
00:01:58,986 --> 00:02:00,487
I don't know

79
00:01:58,986 --> 00:02:00,487
what you're talking about.

80
00:02:00,529 --> 00:02:02,698
Oh-oh, dear, I think

81
00:02:00,529 --> 00:02:02,698
I got something in my eye.

82
00:02:02,739 --> 00:02:05,034
My piercing, blue eye.

83
00:02:06,243 --> 00:02:08,578
Sheldon!

84
00:02:06,243 --> 00:02:08,578
Fine.

85
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:12,582
I've also never had a cavity

86
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:12,582
and I don't have asthma...

would have been my wedding

103
00:02:40,694 --> 00:02:43,906
if Anu and I hadn't decided

104
00:02:40,694 --> 00:02:43,906
to slow things down.

105
00:02:43,947 --> 00:02:46,867
Oh, yeah, I would have

106
00:02:43,947 --> 00:02:46,867
forgotten, except for those

107
00:02:46,909 --> 00:02:49,661
nonrefundable airline tickets

108
00:02:46,909 --> 00:02:49,661
to India I bought.

109
00:02:49,703 --> 00:02:50,954
I'm sorry.

110
00:02:50,996 --> 00:02:54,791
No, no. What's $3,000

111
00:02:50,996 --> 00:02:54,791
between friends?

112
00:02:54,833 --> 00:02:56,293
Yeah, I probably

113
00:02:54,833 --> 00:02:56,293
would've just

114
00:02:56,335 --> 00:02:58,628
thrown it away on health care

115
00:02:56,335 --> 00:02:58,628
for my children.

116
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:02,423
Uh, if you still want to go,

117
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:02,423
you can go to India

118
00:03:02,465 --> 00:03:05,261
and help my dad eat

119
00:03:02,465 --> 00:03:05,261
all the nonrefundable sushi.

120
00:03:05,302 --> 00:03:07,428
Indian sushi?

121
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:10,431
I need a change of underwear

122
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:10,431
just thinking about that.

123
00:03:10,473 --> 00:03:13,685
I really think

124
00:03:10,473 --> 00:03:13,685
we made the right decision.

125
00:03:13,727 --> 00:03:15,812
Agreed, although

126
00:03:13,727 --> 00:03:15,812
I did have

127
00:03:15,854 --> 00:03:18,607
a pretty awesome bachelor party

128
00:03:15,854 --> 00:03:18,607
planned for this weekend.

129
00:03:18,648 --> 00:03:19,608
Really? What was it?

130
00:03:19,649 --> 00:03:20,943
Well, I used my NASA connections

131
00:03:20,984 --> 00:03:23,070
to get us four seats

132
00:03:20,984 --> 00:03:23,070
on that plane

133
00:03:23,112 --> 00:03:25,446
that lets you experience

134
00:03:23,112 --> 00:03:25,446
weightlessness.

135
00:03:25,488 --> 00:03:28,533
The Vomit Comet.

136
00:03:25,488 --> 00:03:28,533
That is so cool.

137
00:03:28,575 --> 00:03:30,786
I've always wanted

138
00:03:28,575 --> 00:03:30,786
to experience weightlessness.

139
00:03:30,827 --> 00:03:32,788
The closest I ever came

140
00:03:30,827 --> 00:03:32,788
was that time

141
00:03:32,829 --> 00:03:35,291
I accidentally set my scale

142
00:03:32,829 --> 00:03:35,291
to kilograms.

143
00:03:37,376 --> 00:03:40,170
I know, it would've

144
00:03:37,376 --> 00:03:40,170
been fun, but, hey,

145
00:03:40,212 --> 00:03:43,924
the next time you decide to

146
00:03:40,212 --> 00:03:43,924
marry a woman you barely know.

147
00:03:43,966 --> 00:03:45,342
We could still go.

148
00:03:45,384 --> 00:03:47,469
You know, make it

149
00:03:45,384 --> 00:03:47,469
a guys' weekend.

150
00:03:47,510 --> 00:03:49,805
Yeah. (chuckles)

151
00:03:47,510 --> 00:03:49,805
All right, let's do it.

152
00:03:49,846 --> 00:03:52,557
Great. It'll be like

153
00:03:49,846 --> 00:03:52,557
the good old days.

154
00:03:52,599 --> 00:03:55,936
You mean when we were all sad,

155
00:03:52,599 --> 00:03:55,936
desperate and horribly alone?

156
00:03:57,687 --> 00:03:59,773
I remember it more fondly.

157
00:04:02,359 --> 00:04:05,195
Leonard, if you had

158
00:04:02,359 --> 00:04:05,195
food on your face,

159
00:04:05,237 --> 00:04:06,363
would you want me to tell you?

160
00:04:06,405 --> 00:04:09,532
Where? Did I get it?

161
00:04:09,574 --> 00:04:11,660
Oh, no, not now;

162
00:04:09,574 --> 00:04:11,660
it was last week.

163
00:04:13,203 --> 00:04:14,704
I didn't know

164
00:04:13,203 --> 00:04:14,704
whether or not to tell you,

165
00:04:14,746 --> 00:04:16,623
but everyone was staring.

166
00:04:16,665 --> 00:04:19,293
For the record,

167
00:04:16,665 --> 00:04:19,293
it was right there.

168
00:04:19,335 --> 00:04:21,878
And it was Nutella.

169
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,088
Thanks.

170
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:25,090
You looked like

171
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:25,090
a hazelnut Hitler.

172
00:04:26,467 --> 00:04:28,760
Hey, who wants to hear

173
00:04:26,467 --> 00:04:28,760
some exciting news?

174
00:04:28,802 --> 00:04:30,262
Oh, what's up?

175
00:04:30,304 --> 00:04:33,723
This weekend, I got us

176
00:04:30,304 --> 00:04:33,723
four seats on the Vomit Comet.

177
00:04:33,765 --> 00:04:36,643
Oh, you lost me at "vomit,"

178
00:04:33,765 --> 00:04:36,643
you lost me again at "comet,"

179
00:04:36,685 --> 00:04:39,313
and to be honest, I was

180
00:04:36,685 --> 00:04:39,313
on the fence at "us."

181
00:04:40,897 --> 00:04:42,774
Yeah, I can't go either.

182
00:04:40,897 --> 00:04:42,774
Penny's dad is visiting

183
00:04:42,816 --> 00:04:44,860
from Nebraska, and I haven't

184
00:04:42,816 --> 00:04:44,860
seen him for a while.

185
00:04:44,901 --> 00:04:46,987
Oh, that's nice

186
00:04:44,901 --> 00:04:46,987
you guys get along.

187
00:04:47,029 --> 00:04:49,572
I forget, Howard, does your

188
00:04:47,029 --> 00:04:49,572
father-in-law still hate you?

189
00:04:51,825 --> 00:04:53,243
WOLOWITZ:

190
00:04:51,825 --> 00:04:53,243
He doesn't hate me.

191
00:04:53,285 --> 00:04:54,870
He's just disappointed

192
00:04:54,911 --> 00:04:57,122
that I'm not

193
00:04:54,911 --> 00:04:57,122
any other man on the planet.

194
00:04:58,748 --> 00:05:02,169
That's how I feel about

195
00:04:58,748 --> 00:05:02,169
Ben Affleck as Batman.

196
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:04,380
Well, these two are out.

197
00:05:04,421 --> 00:05:05,839
There goes

198
00:05:04,421 --> 00:05:05,839
our guys' weekend.

199
00:05:05,881 --> 00:05:08,091
Okay, so let's make it

200
00:05:05,881 --> 00:05:08,091
a couples' weekend.

201
00:05:08,133 --> 00:05:09,592
I'll bring Anu,

202
00:05:08,133 --> 00:05:09,592
you bring Bernadette.

203
00:05:09,634 --> 00:05:10,844
I'm not sure

204
00:05:09,634 --> 00:05:10,844
Bernie would like it.

205
00:05:10,886 --> 00:05:12,679
Maybe I'll invite

206
00:05:10,886 --> 00:05:12,679
Stuart or Bert.

207
00:05:12,721 --> 00:05:14,306
SHELDON:

208
00:05:12,721 --> 00:05:14,306
Oh, go with Bert!

209
00:05:14,348 --> 00:05:16,808
He's huge. It'd be fun to

210
00:05:14,348 --> 00:05:16,808
watch him float around.

211
00:05:18,101 --> 00:05:19,853
Like that time the

212
00:05:18,101 --> 00:05:19,853
Underdog balloon

213
00:05:19,895 --> 00:05:22,356
got away at the

214
00:05:19,895 --> 00:05:22,356
Macy's Parade.

215
00:05:25,067 --> 00:05:26,693
Hey. What are those?

216
00:05:26,735 --> 00:05:28,237
Oh, vitamins.

217
00:05:28,278 --> 00:05:31,407
Zack wants me to take them

218
00:05:28,278 --> 00:05:31,407
to increase my virility.

219
00:05:31,448 --> 00:05:33,825
Zack used the word "virility"?

220
00:05:35,911 --> 00:05:38,621
He may have said

221
00:05:35,911 --> 00:05:38,621
"wiener power."

222
00:05:39,789 --> 00:05:40,749
(knock on door)

223
00:05:40,790 --> 00:05:42,334
Okay, that's my dad.

224
00:05:42,376 --> 00:05:44,753
Now, remember, do not bring up

225
00:05:42,376 --> 00:05:44,753
any baby stuff, all right?

226
00:05:44,794 --> 00:05:46,922
Not me not wanting one,

227
00:05:44,794 --> 00:05:46,922
not you having one with Zack.

228
00:05:46,963 --> 00:05:48,589
Got it.

229
00:05:46,963 --> 00:05:48,589
And if he brings it up,

230
00:05:46,963 --> 00:05:48,589
change the subject

231
00:05:48,631 --> 00:05:50,259
to literally anything else.

232
00:05:48,631 --> 00:05:50,259
I got it.

233
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:53,470
But not the Cornhuskers.

234
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:53,470
Do not discuss the Cornhuskers.

235
00:05:53,512 --> 00:05:56,390
Is that a sports team?

236
00:05:56,432 --> 00:05:57,933
Never mind, you're good.

237
00:05:59,518 --> 00:06:01,478
Daddy! Hi.

238
00:05:59,518 --> 00:06:01,478
Hey, Slugger.

239
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,146
(chuckles)

240
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,146
Aw.

241
00:06:03,188 --> 00:06:05,815
Hey, Wyatt.

242
00:06:03,188 --> 00:06:05,815
Leonard.

243
00:06:05,857 --> 00:06:07,776
Hey, that's a hell

244
00:06:05,857 --> 00:06:07,776
of a handshake.

245
00:06:07,817 --> 00:06:10,611
Ah, well, you know,

246
00:06:07,817 --> 00:06:10,611
I've been taking vitamins.

247
00:06:10,653 --> 00:06:13,282
Dad, uh, come on in,

248
00:06:10,653 --> 00:06:13,282
sit down.

249
00:06:13,323 --> 00:06:15,451
Can I get you something

250
00:06:13,323 --> 00:06:15,451
to drink? Maybe a beer?

251
00:06:15,492 --> 00:06:17,286
Sure, if you're having one.

252
00:06:15,492 --> 00:06:17,286
Okay.

253
00:06:17,327 --> 00:06:19,204
And why wouldn't you,

254
00:06:17,327 --> 00:06:19,204
since you're not pregnant?

255
00:06:21,331 --> 00:06:23,417
Um...

256
00:06:23,459 --> 00:06:25,961
Leonard wants to have a baby

257
00:06:23,459 --> 00:06:25,961
with my ex-boyfriend Zack.

258
00:06:31,674 --> 00:06:34,386
How 'bout those Cornhuskers?

259
00:06:38,014 --> 00:06:42,352
Hey, would you mind if Raj

260
00:06:38,014 --> 00:06:42,352
and I went away this weekend?

261
00:06:42,394 --> 00:06:46,022
Well, it is important for you

262
00:06:42,394 --> 00:06:46,022
two to keep the spark alive.

263
00:06:46,064 --> 00:06:49,276
No, just the bachelor party

264
00:06:46,064 --> 00:06:49,276
I had planned.

265
00:06:49,318 --> 00:06:50,651
I thought we'd do it anyway.

266
00:06:50,693 --> 00:06:52,321
Oh, so a guys' weekend?

267
00:06:52,362 --> 00:06:54,448
Kinda. I mean, Sheldon

268
00:06:52,362 --> 00:06:54,448
and Leonard couldn't make it,

269
00:06:54,490 --> 00:06:56,741
so Raj invited Anu

270
00:06:54,490 --> 00:06:56,741
and I asked Stuart.

271
00:06:58,535 --> 00:07:01,163
Wait, you invited Stuart

272
00:06:58,535 --> 00:07:01,163
before me?

273
00:07:01,204 --> 00:07:02,831
Actually, I invited Bert

274
00:07:01,204 --> 00:07:02,831
before Stuart,

275
00:07:02,872 --> 00:07:05,459
but I don't know why

276
00:07:02,872 --> 00:07:05,459
I just told you that.

277
00:07:05,501 --> 00:07:07,085
Why didn't you invite me?

278
00:07:07,127 --> 00:07:09,712
Because (chuckles)

279
00:07:07,127 --> 00:07:09,712
I know you.

280
00:07:09,754 --> 00:07:13,175
You don't want to float

281
00:07:09,754 --> 00:07:13,175
weightless in an airplane.

282
00:07:13,216 --> 00:07:14,384
What are you

283
00:07:13,216 --> 00:07:14,384
talking about?

284
00:07:14,426 --> 00:07:16,136
I love doing crazy

285
00:07:14,426 --> 00:07:16,136
stuff like that.

286
00:07:16,178 --> 00:07:19,848
Bernie, you got sick from

287
00:07:16,178 --> 00:07:19,848
the teacup ride at Disneyland.

288
00:07:19,889 --> 00:07:21,600
Lots of people do.

289
00:07:21,642 --> 00:07:24,186
We were still in line.

290
00:07:24,227 --> 00:07:25,854
So you don't want me to go?

291
00:07:25,895 --> 00:07:28,649
No, I want you to go

292
00:07:25,895 --> 00:07:28,649
if you're gonna have fun.

293
00:07:28,690 --> 00:07:31,067
I don't want you to go

294
00:07:28,690 --> 00:07:31,067
if you're gonna be miserable

295
00:07:31,109 --> 00:07:32,819
and ruin it for everyone.

296
00:07:33,945 --> 00:07:35,864
Which is a long way of saying

297
00:07:35,905 --> 00:07:37,449
I want you to go!

298
00:07:40,076 --> 00:07:42,704
(quietly): I think this is

299
00:07:40,076 --> 00:07:42,704
going pretty good, huh?

300
00:07:45,748 --> 00:07:48,669
Maybe for you.

301
00:07:45,748 --> 00:07:48,669
You threw me under the bus.

302
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:50,587
Oh, I'm sorry. I panicked.

303
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:50,587
He was judging me.

304
00:07:50,629 --> 00:07:52,381
Well, yeah, now he's judging me.

305
00:07:52,422 --> 00:07:53,674
I know. It worked.

306
00:07:55,258 --> 00:07:58,554
You two might want to talk

307
00:07:55,258 --> 00:07:58,554
louder or quieter.

308
00:07:58,595 --> 00:08:01,264
In high school, he could

309
00:07:58,595 --> 00:08:01,264
hear me open a can of beer

310
00:08:01,306 --> 00:08:02,599
in my closet

311
00:08:01,306 --> 00:08:02,599
under a blanket.

312
00:08:06,186 --> 00:08:09,356
So let me get this

313
00:08:06,186 --> 00:08:09,356
straight, Leonard.

314
00:08:09,398 --> 00:08:10,899
She doesn't want

315
00:08:09,398 --> 00:08:10,899
to have your baby,

316
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:13,902
but her dumbbell

317
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:13,902
ex-boyfriend does.

318
00:08:13,943 --> 00:08:17,239
Well, I— no, I wouldn't

319
00:08:13,943 --> 00:08:17,239
say it like that.

320
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,615
How would you say it?

321
00:08:18,657 --> 00:08:20,200
(sighs)

322
00:08:20,242 --> 00:08:22,202
Uh, same words, just less angry.

323
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:25,830
Well, I don't know

324
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:25,830
about Los Angeles,

325
00:08:25,872 --> 00:08:28,875
but in Nebraska,

326
00:08:25,872 --> 00:08:28,875
that's kind of strange.

327
00:08:28,917 --> 00:08:32,337
It's strange here, too,

328
00:08:28,917 --> 00:08:32,337
and we have a bakery for dogs.

329
00:08:32,379 --> 00:08:34,256
And you're okay with this?

330
00:08:34,297 --> 00:08:35,757
I support my husband.

331
00:08:34,297 --> 00:08:35,757
Thank you.

332
00:08:35,798 --> 00:08:37,008
But, you know,

333
00:08:35,798 --> 00:08:37,008
if you think differently,

334
00:08:37,050 --> 00:08:38,260
you should feel free

335
00:08:37,050 --> 00:08:38,260
to say so.

336
00:08:38,301 --> 00:08:41,763
You know, just like, "Ah!"

337
00:08:38,301 --> 00:08:41,763
Make a scene.

338
00:08:41,804 --> 00:08:45,475
Okay, look, they can't

339
00:08:41,804 --> 00:08:45,475
have kids of their own,

340
00:08:45,517 --> 00:08:46,809
and they like

341
00:08:45,517 --> 00:08:46,809
that I'm smart,

342
00:08:46,851 --> 00:08:48,729
and they want that

343
00:08:46,851 --> 00:08:48,729
for their child.

344
00:08:48,770 --> 00:08:49,563
No, I get it.

345
00:08:49,605 --> 00:08:50,439
You do?

346
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,814
Sure.

347
00:08:51,856 --> 00:08:53,900
Back on the farm,

348
00:08:51,856 --> 00:08:53,900
we had a prize stallion.

349
00:08:53,942 --> 00:08:58,029
We didn't let that just go to

350
00:08:53,942 --> 00:08:58,029
waste; we put him out to stud.

351
00:08:59,822 --> 00:09:02,659
No, no, this is... this is

352
00:08:59,822 --> 00:09:02,659
a little different than that...

353
00:09:02,701 --> 00:09:05,454
No, no, hey, hey,

354
00:09:02,701 --> 00:09:05,454
hey, hey, hey, hey.

355
00:09:05,495 --> 00:09:07,830
Uh, you were comparing me

356
00:09:05,495 --> 00:09:07,830
to a prize stud. Go on.

357
00:09:11,918 --> 00:09:13,545
You have fun with

358
00:09:13,587 --> 00:09:14,921
your new best buddy?

359
00:09:14,963 --> 00:09:16,715
Hey, it's your fault

360
00:09:14,963 --> 00:09:16,715
your dad likes me.

361
00:09:16,757 --> 00:09:18,717
You dated idiots

362
00:09:16,757 --> 00:09:18,717
your whole life.

363
00:09:18,759 --> 00:09:21,344
Well, he was right

364
00:09:18,759 --> 00:09:21,344
about one thing.

365
00:09:21,386 --> 00:09:24,598
I am married to a stud.

366
00:09:21,386 --> 00:09:24,598
(chuckles)

367
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,600
Mm. Really?

368
00:09:26,642 --> 00:09:28,351
Yeah, I felt so bad

369
00:09:26,642 --> 00:09:28,351
about selling you out,

370
00:09:28,393 --> 00:09:30,646
I thought I would

371
00:09:28,393 --> 00:09:30,646
maybe make it up to you.

372
00:09:30,687 --> 00:09:32,147
(both chuckle)

373
00:09:32,188 --> 00:09:34,566
(moans)

374
00:09:34,608 --> 00:09:36,276
(stammers)

375
00:09:34,608 --> 00:09:36,276
Wait, wait. I can't.

376
00:09:36,318 --> 00:09:37,736
I mean, I want to,

377
00:09:37,778 --> 00:09:39,655
but I'm not supposed to

378
00:09:37,778 --> 00:09:39,655
for the next three days.

379
00:09:39,696 --> 00:09:42,616
Oh. That's right.

380
00:09:39,696 --> 00:09:42,616
I forgot. (groans)

381
00:09:42,658 --> 00:09:45,118
All right, well, guess

382
00:09:42,658 --> 00:09:45,118
I'll just read a little

383
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:47,078
and then— I don't

384
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:47,078
know— go to sleep.

385
00:09:51,374 --> 00:09:54,419
Really? That's what

386
00:09:51,374 --> 00:09:54,419
you're sleeping in?

387
00:09:54,461 --> 00:09:55,629
Oh, you want me to take it off?

388
00:09:55,671 --> 00:09:56,879
No.

389
00:09:56,921 --> 00:09:58,507
All right.

390
00:09:58,548 --> 00:10:00,883
Well, then pipe down

391
00:09:58,548 --> 00:10:00,883
and let me read my comic book.

392
00:10:02,093 --> 00:10:04,429
Penny, I-I know

393
00:10:02,093 --> 00:10:04,429
what you're doing.

394
00:10:04,471 --> 00:10:05,305
Just please stop.

395
00:10:05,347 --> 00:10:07,474
Ooh, listen to this.

396
00:10:07,516 --> 00:10:08,767
"Bam.

397
00:10:08,809 --> 00:10:09,892
"Pow.

398
00:10:09,934 --> 00:10:12,020
Take that, Batman."

399
00:10:15,273 --> 00:10:16,983
Thanks again for

400
00:10:15,273 --> 00:10:16,983
doing this, guys.

401
00:10:17,025 --> 00:10:19,110
Of course.

402
00:10:17,025 --> 00:10:19,110
So excited.

403
00:10:19,152 --> 00:10:20,821
I'm glad you came.

404
00:10:20,862 --> 00:10:23,031
Howard made it sound like

405
00:10:20,862 --> 00:10:23,031
this wasn't your kind of thing.

406
00:10:23,072 --> 00:10:24,783
He did say that, but here I am.

407
00:10:24,825 --> 00:10:26,785
So what does he know?

408
00:10:26,827 --> 00:10:28,829
I'm sorry. I just...

409
00:10:26,827 --> 00:10:28,829
(scoffs)

410
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:30,831
didn't think you'd enjoy

411
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:30,831
plummeting to the Earth

412
00:10:30,872 --> 00:10:32,165
at 400 miles an hour.

413
00:10:32,207 --> 00:10:33,916
I love going fast,

414
00:10:33,958 --> 00:10:35,251
unlike Grandma here,

415
00:10:35,293 --> 00:10:36,919
poking along

416
00:10:35,293 --> 00:10:36,919
at 70 miles an hour.

417
00:10:36,961 --> 00:10:38,254
Am I right?

418
00:10:39,548 --> 00:10:41,800
I've always wanted

419
00:10:39,548 --> 00:10:41,800
to do this.

420
00:10:41,842 --> 00:10:43,677
I'm an adrenaline junkie.

421
00:10:43,719 --> 00:10:45,178
Roller coasters, snowboarding,

422
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:48,431
dating men

423
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:48,431
who bathe with their dogs.

424
00:10:48,473 --> 00:10:51,309
It was during a drought.

425
00:10:52,394 --> 00:10:54,145
I'm a thrill-seeker, too.

426
00:10:54,187 --> 00:10:56,189
I've had to pull back

427
00:10:54,187 --> 00:10:56,189
since I became a mom,

428
00:10:56,231 --> 00:10:58,734
but I'll still jump on the back

429
00:10:56,231 --> 00:10:58,734
of a grocery cart

430
00:10:58,775 --> 00:11:01,695
and just roll

431
00:10:58,775 --> 00:11:01,695
through the meat section.

432
00:11:02,863 --> 00:11:04,072
And I'm married

433
00:11:02,863 --> 00:11:04,072
to her,

434
00:11:04,113 --> 00:11:06,658
which is quite

435
00:11:04,113 --> 00:11:06,658
the ride.

436
00:11:21,256 --> 00:11:23,174
(exhales)

437
00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:51,870
(sputters)

438
00:12:08,261 --> 00:12:10,179
(clinking)

439
00:12:30,617 --> 00:12:32,619
Amy?

440
00:12:33,453 --> 00:12:34,663
Yeah?

441
00:12:34,704 --> 00:12:37,833
There's something out here.

442
00:12:37,874 --> 00:12:39,626
Just trap it

443
00:12:37,874 --> 00:12:39,626
under a cup,

444
00:12:39,668 --> 00:12:42,002
and I'll be there

445
00:12:39,668 --> 00:12:42,002
in a minute.

446
00:12:42,044 --> 00:12:45,632
I'll try, but

447
00:12:42,044 --> 00:12:45,632
it's Leonard.

448
00:12:45,674 --> 00:12:47,133
What?

449
00:12:47,175 --> 00:12:48,593
(grunts)

450
00:12:49,845 --> 00:12:51,805
Well, what is

451
00:12:49,845 --> 00:12:51,805
he doing here?

452
00:12:51,847 --> 00:12:53,348
I told you, if we left

453
00:12:51,847 --> 00:12:53,348
pizza on the counter,

454
00:12:53,389 --> 00:12:55,350
we'd attract

455
00:12:53,389 --> 00:12:55,350
something.

456
00:12:56,476 --> 00:12:57,978
Oh, hey, guys.

457
00:12:58,018 --> 00:12:59,354
Sorry. I used my key.

458
00:12:59,395 --> 00:13:01,230
I just needed

459
00:12:59,395 --> 00:13:01,230
a place to crash.

460
00:13:01,272 --> 00:13:02,774
Is everything okay?

461
00:13:02,816 --> 00:13:04,108
Yeah, I...

462
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:06,026
had to get out of the apartment.

463
00:13:06,068 --> 00:13:09,113
My wife kept trying

464
00:13:06,068 --> 00:13:09,113
to have sex with me.

465
00:13:10,239 --> 00:13:11,366
Been there.

466
00:13:17,789 --> 00:13:20,333
Why are you trying

467
00:13:17,789 --> 00:13:20,333
to avoid having sex?

468
00:13:20,375 --> 00:13:22,126
Well, we just did it

469
00:13:20,375 --> 00:13:22,126
three weeks ago.

470
00:13:20,375 --> 00:13:22,126
I was talking

471
00:13:22,168 --> 00:13:23,712
to Leonard!

472
00:13:26,214 --> 00:13:27,841
Well, I-I have to go

473
00:13:26,214 --> 00:13:27,841
to the clinic

474
00:13:27,883 --> 00:13:29,342
for Zack and Marissa on Monday,

475
00:13:29,384 --> 00:13:32,178
and I'm supposed

476
00:13:29,384 --> 00:13:32,178
to save myself until then.

477
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:36,850
Sounds like maybe Penny's not

478
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:36,850
totally on board with that plan.

479
00:13:36,892 --> 00:13:39,019
Well, she said she was.

480
00:13:39,059 --> 00:13:42,856
But she also said

481
00:13:39,059 --> 00:13:42,856
I looked dope.

482
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:48,028
Honestly, I don't even

483
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:48,028
think I looked fly.

484
00:13:48,068 --> 00:13:49,529
So you're willing

485
00:13:48,068 --> 00:13:49,529
to go through with this,

486
00:13:49,571 --> 00:13:51,698
even though

487
00:13:49,571 --> 00:13:51,698
she clearly has reservations?

488
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:52,949
If she has a problem,

489
00:13:52,991 --> 00:13:55,117
she should say something.

490
00:13:55,159 --> 00:13:56,160
She tried to seduce you.

491
00:13:56,202 --> 00:13:57,161
If that's not a cry for help,

492
00:13:57,203 --> 00:13:58,747
I don't know what is.

493
00:14:00,248 --> 00:14:02,709
Penny doesn't want

494
00:14:00,248 --> 00:14:02,709
to have kids.

495
00:14:02,751 --> 00:14:04,335
I respect that.

496
00:14:04,377 --> 00:14:07,839
But this is my chance to

497
00:14:04,377 --> 00:14:07,839
leave a part of me behind.

498
00:14:07,881 --> 00:14:11,384
Okay, but this isn't

499
00:14:07,881 --> 00:14:11,384
gonna make you a dad.

500
00:14:11,426 --> 00:14:13,845
It's gonna be

501
00:14:11,426 --> 00:14:13,845
their baby, not yours.

502
00:14:13,887 --> 00:14:15,555
Although,

503
00:14:13,887 --> 00:14:15,555
someday,

504
00:14:15,597 --> 00:14:17,557
if that kid wants

505
00:14:15,597 --> 00:14:17,557
to know why he's short,

506
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:19,976
nearsighted, and asthmatic...

507
00:14:21,269 --> 00:14:23,438
he may hunt you down.

508
00:14:26,482 --> 00:14:30,445
Are you guys ready for the most

509
00:14:26,482 --> 00:14:30,445
intense experience of your life?

510
00:14:30,486 --> 00:14:32,072
Yes.

511
00:14:30,486 --> 00:14:32,072
Definitely.

512
00:14:32,113 --> 00:14:33,364
Not to brag, but

513
00:14:32,113 --> 00:14:33,364
I'm an astronaut,

514
00:14:33,406 --> 00:14:35,199
so I've been

515
00:14:33,406 --> 00:14:35,199
weightless before.

516
00:14:35,241 --> 00:14:37,201
Can be pretty scary.

517
00:14:38,327 --> 00:14:40,288
Please, I'm, like, 90 pounds.

518
00:14:40,329 --> 00:14:44,292
I'm weightless every time

519
00:14:40,329 --> 00:14:44,292
I hold more than three balloons.

520
00:14:44,333 --> 00:14:46,962
Okay, I just need you guys

521
00:14:44,333 --> 00:14:46,962
to sign these waivers,

522
00:14:47,003 --> 00:14:48,421
and then you

523
00:14:47,003 --> 00:14:48,421
can go get changed.

524
00:14:48,463 --> 00:14:50,256
There are a lot

525
00:14:48,463 --> 00:14:50,256
of pages here.

526
00:14:50,298 --> 00:14:52,801
Is this a waiver or a screenplay

527
00:14:50,298 --> 00:14:52,801
you've been working on?

528
00:14:54,010 --> 00:14:55,929
I'm sure it's just

529
00:14:54,010 --> 00:14:55,929
boilerplate.

530
00:14:55,971 --> 00:14:58,598
Absolutely. It's to protect us

531
00:14:55,971 --> 00:14:58,598
in case of injury.

532
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:01,267
It says, "Or death."

533
00:15:03,103 --> 00:15:05,396
Which is awesome.

534
00:15:06,982 --> 00:15:08,942
Done.

535
00:15:06,982 --> 00:15:08,942
Where are the

536
00:15:06,982 --> 00:15:08,942
changing rooms?

537
00:15:08,984 --> 00:15:11,360
Dressing rooms

538
00:15:08,984 --> 00:15:11,360
are in the back.

539
00:15:11,402 --> 00:15:13,321
No peeking.

540
00:15:15,782 --> 00:15:17,408
Here you go.

541
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:19,661
Okay. Should we go get changed?

542
00:15:19,702 --> 00:15:21,663
Yeah. Hang on a second.

543
00:15:21,704 --> 00:15:23,123
What?

544
00:15:23,164 --> 00:15:24,916
Just—

545
00:15:23,164 --> 00:15:24,916
I have two babies at home.

546
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:26,292
What am I doing?

547
00:15:26,334 --> 00:15:27,919
If you don't want to do this,

548
00:15:27,961 --> 00:15:29,462
then why'd you come?

549
00:15:29,504 --> 00:15:31,131
To prove to Howard

550
00:15:29,504 --> 00:15:31,131
that he doesn't know me as well

551
00:15:31,172 --> 00:15:33,466
as he thinks he does.

552
00:15:33,508 --> 00:15:35,301
Looks like he does.

553
00:15:35,343 --> 00:15:38,638
Unless I do it

554
00:15:35,343 --> 00:15:38,638
and then he doesn't.

555
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:41,808
Why not just be honest?

556
00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:43,476
(sighs)

557
00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:43,476
You're right.

558
00:15:43,518 --> 00:15:45,478
I should be honest.

559
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:49,649
You owe me $3,000 for those

560
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:49,649
plane tickets to India!

561
00:15:52,694 --> 00:15:53,820
(cheering on TV)

562
00:15:53,862 --> 00:15:55,113
(sighs)

563
00:15:55,155 --> 00:15:56,948
Hey.

564
00:15:58,033 --> 00:15:59,450
That was a long run.

565
00:15:59,492 --> 00:16:01,369
Yeah. Well,

566
00:15:59,492 --> 00:16:01,369
I was in the zone.

567
00:16:01,410 --> 00:16:03,121
You know,

568
00:16:01,410 --> 00:16:03,121
and then in a diner

569
00:16:03,163 --> 00:16:07,959
and then in a massage chair

570
00:16:03,163 --> 00:16:07,959
at the mall where I fell asleep.

571
00:16:08,001 --> 00:16:10,170
Are you avoiding me?

572
00:16:10,211 --> 00:16:12,338
Well, I took a nap

573
00:16:10,211 --> 00:16:12,338
next to Hot Dog on a Stick.

574
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:13,798
What do you think?

575
00:16:15,633 --> 00:16:18,928
I think you're mad at me

576
00:16:15,633 --> 00:16:18,928
and Leonard,

577
00:16:18,970 --> 00:16:22,223
but maybe... you're really mad

578
00:16:18,970 --> 00:16:22,223
at yourself.

579
00:16:22,264 --> 00:16:24,350
Why would I be

580
00:16:22,264 --> 00:16:24,350
mad at myself?

581
00:16:24,392 --> 00:16:27,854
'Cause you regret

582
00:16:24,392 --> 00:16:27,854
this "no baby" plan of yours.

583
00:16:27,896 --> 00:16:29,105
You know, it's

584
00:16:27,896 --> 00:16:29,105
pretty crappy of you

585
00:16:29,147 --> 00:16:30,398
to make me feel

586
00:16:29,147 --> 00:16:30,398
bad about this.

587
00:16:30,439 --> 00:16:32,358
I'm not trying

588
00:16:30,439 --> 00:16:32,358
to make you feel bad.

589
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:35,653
But... do you?

590
00:16:36,529 --> 00:16:37,906
Yes.

591
00:16:37,947 --> 00:16:39,782
I feel like I'm

592
00:16:37,947 --> 00:16:39,782
letting everybody down.

593
00:16:39,824 --> 00:16:41,201
Hate disappointing Leonard,

594
00:16:41,242 --> 00:16:43,369
but I really hate

595
00:16:41,242 --> 00:16:43,369
disappointing you.

596
00:16:43,411 --> 00:16:45,663
Oh, Slugger, you could

597
00:16:43,411 --> 00:16:45,663
never disappoint me.

598
00:16:48,083 --> 00:16:51,627
Okay, your high school years

599
00:16:48,083 --> 00:16:51,627
were a little rough.

600
00:16:52,712 --> 00:16:54,505
And I'm sorry about that.

601
00:16:54,547 --> 00:16:55,924
There was you

602
00:16:54,547 --> 00:16:55,924
sneaking out at night

603
00:16:55,965 --> 00:16:57,884
and your boyfriends

604
00:16:55,965 --> 00:16:57,884
sneaking out in the morning.

605
00:16:57,926 --> 00:16:59,677
I said sorry.

606
00:16:59,719 --> 00:17:01,721
That time you got drunk

607
00:16:59,719 --> 00:17:01,721
and stole a horse.

608
00:17:01,763 --> 00:17:03,264
Yeah.

609
00:17:03,305 --> 00:17:04,724
I was there.

610
00:17:03,305 --> 00:17:04,724
I remember.

611
00:17:04,766 --> 00:17:06,559
Parts of it.

612
00:17:06,601 --> 00:17:08,978
But besides all that,

613
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:11,731
being your dad is the best thing

614
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:11,731
ever happened to me.

615
00:17:12,982 --> 00:17:14,692
What about

616
00:17:12,982 --> 00:17:14,692
Randall and Lisa?

617
00:17:15,777 --> 00:17:18,238
They're okay.

618
00:17:18,279 --> 00:17:20,448
I just don't want you

619
00:17:18,279 --> 00:17:20,448
to miss out.

620
00:17:20,489 --> 00:17:22,450
I know.

621
00:17:22,491 --> 00:17:24,786
But if this is

622
00:17:22,491 --> 00:17:24,786
really what you want—

623
00:17:24,827 --> 00:17:26,579
or don't want—

624
00:17:26,621 --> 00:17:28,248
I'm on your side.

625
00:17:28,289 --> 00:17:30,208
Thanks.

626
00:17:31,918 --> 00:17:32,877
(door opens)

627
00:17:32,919 --> 00:17:33,753
Hey.

628
00:17:33,795 --> 00:17:34,921
Hey.

629
00:17:34,963 --> 00:17:37,132
Uh, Wyatt, we need to talk.

630
00:17:37,173 --> 00:17:38,800
Sure. What's up?

631
00:17:38,841 --> 00:17:41,928
I want you to back off.

632
00:17:41,970 --> 00:17:45,306
You know? I-If Penny and I don't

633
00:17:41,970 --> 00:17:45,306
have kids, that's between us.

634
00:17:45,347 --> 00:17:47,308
So you need

635
00:17:45,347 --> 00:17:47,308
to stay out of it.

636
00:17:47,349 --> 00:17:49,060
Oh, Leonard, it's okay.

637
00:17:47,349 --> 00:17:49,060
We talked. We're good.

638
00:17:50,145 --> 00:17:51,562
Oh.

639
00:17:54,816 --> 00:17:58,153
Okay, you could've

640
00:17:54,816 --> 00:17:58,153
stopped me sooner.

641
00:17:58,194 --> 00:17:59,821
Could've let

642
00:17:58,194 --> 00:17:59,821
you go longer.

643
00:17:59,862 --> 00:18:01,781
Uh-huh.

644
00:18:01,823 --> 00:18:03,741
You did great, Leonard.

645
00:18:01,823 --> 00:18:03,741
Very forceful.

646
00:18:03,783 --> 00:18:05,409
Yeah?

647
00:18:03,783 --> 00:18:05,409
(chuckles)

648
00:18:05,451 --> 00:18:09,038
I-I-I felt like my voice

649
00:18:05,451 --> 00:18:09,038
was a little shaky there.

650
00:18:10,832 --> 00:18:12,917
Um...

651
00:18:12,959 --> 00:18:15,503
Hey, I decided

652
00:18:12,959 --> 00:18:15,503
to not go through

653
00:18:15,544 --> 00:18:17,797
with this Zack

654
00:18:15,544 --> 00:18:17,797
and Marissa thing.

655
00:18:17,839 --> 00:18:19,215
Really?

656
00:18:19,257 --> 00:18:21,134
But you were

657
00:18:19,257 --> 00:18:21,134
so excited about it.

658
00:18:19,257 --> 00:18:21,134
I know.

659
00:18:21,176 --> 00:18:22,802
But, um...

660
00:18:22,844 --> 00:18:25,138
I think I was just

661
00:18:22,844 --> 00:18:25,138
fooling myself.

662
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:29,267
I-I would be heartbroken

663
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:29,267
if I had a kid out there

664
00:18:29,309 --> 00:18:31,311
and I wasn't his dad.

665
00:18:31,352 --> 00:18:33,188
I know you would.

666
00:18:33,229 --> 00:18:34,981
(clicks tongue)

667
00:18:33,229 --> 00:18:34,981
Yeah.

668
00:18:35,023 --> 00:18:36,983
(inhales deeply)

669
00:18:37,025 --> 00:18:39,319
(quietly): So, that thing

670
00:18:37,025 --> 00:18:39,319
you wanted to do last night,

671
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:42,280
I'm available.

672
00:18:42,322 --> 00:18:44,448
I got real good hearing there,

673
00:18:42,322 --> 00:18:44,448
stud.

674
00:18:47,243 --> 00:18:49,954
All right,

675
00:18:47,243 --> 00:18:49,954
everyone's suited up.

676
00:18:49,996 --> 00:18:51,664
Let's head out

677
00:18:49,996 --> 00:18:51,664
to the tarmac!

678
00:18:51,706 --> 00:18:53,624
Actually, one second.

679
00:18:53,666 --> 00:18:56,502
Howie, I don't think

680
00:18:53,666 --> 00:18:56,502
I should do this.

681
00:18:56,544 --> 00:18:57,837
Really?

682
00:18:57,879 --> 00:19:01,090
Well, I did

683
00:18:57,879 --> 00:19:01,090
not see that coming.

684
00:19:02,633 --> 00:19:04,093
Just— We have kids,

685
00:19:04,135 --> 00:19:06,679
and it's not smart to

686
00:19:04,135 --> 00:19:06,679
put us both in danger.

687
00:19:06,721 --> 00:19:07,680
That's a good point.

688
00:19:07,722 --> 00:19:08,973
When I was little,

689
00:19:07,722 --> 00:19:08,973
my parents

690
00:19:09,015 --> 00:19:10,225
never flew together.

691
00:19:10,266 --> 00:19:11,684
We thought it was

692
00:19:10,266 --> 00:19:11,684
because they loved us,

693
00:19:11,726 --> 00:19:14,478
but it turns out

694
00:19:11,726 --> 00:19:14,478
they hated each other.

695
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:16,356
See?

696
00:19:16,438 --> 00:19:18,358
I just think

697
00:19:16,438 --> 00:19:18,358
I shouldn't go.

698
00:19:18,399 --> 00:19:20,068
Actually, this is much safer

699
00:19:18,399 --> 00:19:20,068
than driving a car.

700
00:19:20,109 --> 00:19:21,903
Stay out of it, flyboy!

701
00:19:23,071 --> 00:19:25,240
You're right.

702
00:19:23,071 --> 00:19:25,240
(chuckles)

703
00:19:25,281 --> 00:19:27,242
But I've done this before.

704
00:19:27,283 --> 00:19:29,451
And since you really,

705
00:19:27,283 --> 00:19:29,451
really want to go,

706
00:19:29,493 --> 00:19:30,578
I'll stay here.

707
00:19:31,537 --> 00:19:33,206
Oh. Great.

708
00:19:33,248 --> 00:19:36,167
Unless you don't want to because

709
00:19:33,248 --> 00:19:36,167
I was right and I do know you.

710
00:19:36,209 --> 00:19:38,794
Well, if you really know me,

711
00:19:36,209 --> 00:19:38,794
then you know how far I'll go

712
00:19:38,836 --> 00:19:40,171
to prove a point.

713
00:19:38,836 --> 00:19:40,171
Apparently,

714
00:19:40,213 --> 00:19:41,589
34,000 feet that way,

715
00:19:40,213 --> 00:19:41,589
then straight back down,

716
00:19:41,630 --> 00:19:42,924
up and down,

717
00:19:41,630 --> 00:19:42,924
over and over again

718
00:19:42,965 --> 00:19:45,551
until you throw up food

719
00:19:42,965 --> 00:19:45,551
you didn't even eat.

720
00:19:46,928 --> 00:19:49,680
They are definitely

721
00:19:46,928 --> 00:19:49,680
your weirdest friends.

722
00:19:49,722 --> 00:19:51,140
If only that were true.

723
00:19:52,934 --> 00:19:55,395
(screaming)

724
00:19:55,436 --> 00:19:58,898
I hate this so much!

725
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:01,525
Why am I doing this?

726
00:20:01,567 --> 00:20:04,946
To prove a stupid point

727
00:20:01,567 --> 00:20:04,946
to your husband!

728
00:20:04,987 --> 00:20:06,864
Oh, right. Worth it.

729
00:20:11,577 --> 00:20:13,329
Hey, Zack.

730
00:20:13,371 --> 00:20:16,958
Um, look, I-I know this

731
00:20:13,371 --> 00:20:16,958
is gonna be disappointing,

732
00:20:16,999 --> 00:20:20,544
but, um, I-I can't do this.

733
00:20:20,586 --> 00:20:22,046
No, no, no, no.

734
00:20:22,088 --> 00:20:25,425
I-I, I know how. I just can't.

735
00:20:27,218 --> 00:20:28,552
(stammers)

736
00:20:27,218 --> 00:20:28,552
But, hey, look,

737
00:20:28,594 --> 00:20:29,845
i-if you like,

738
00:20:29,887 --> 00:20:32,390
I-I know someone

739
00:20:29,887 --> 00:20:32,390
who might be interested.

740
00:20:32,432 --> 00:20:35,310
No! Absolutely not!

741
00:20:37,395 --> 00:20:39,230
I'm sorry,

742
00:20:37,395 --> 00:20:39,230
my wife says I'm not allowed.
