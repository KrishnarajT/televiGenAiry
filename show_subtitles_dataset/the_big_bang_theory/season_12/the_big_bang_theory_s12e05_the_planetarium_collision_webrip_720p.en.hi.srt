1
00:00:09,052 --> 00:00:10,970
Recently, 12 new moons

2
00:00:11,012 --> 00:00:12,638
were discovered

3
00:00:11,012 --> 00:00:12,638
orbiting Jupiter,

4
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:15,433
bringing the total up to 79.

5
00:00:15,475 --> 00:00:17,977
As a middle child myself,

6
00:00:15,475 --> 00:00:17,977
I'd like to extend

7
00:00:18,019 --> 00:00:21,481
my sympathies to moons

8
00:00:18,019 --> 00:00:21,481
two through 78.

9
00:00:23,107 --> 00:00:25,485
Your grandpa

10
00:00:23,107 --> 00:00:25,485
will never learn your name.

11
00:00:27,195 --> 00:00:30,198
I'd like to thank you for

12
00:00:27,195 --> 00:00:30,198
joining me on this journey

13
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:32,158
(laughs)

14
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:32,158
through the stars.

15
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:33,743
If you enjoyed

16
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:33,743
this lecture,

17
00:00:33,784 --> 00:00:39,165
please come back Thursday

18
00:00:33,784 --> 00:00:39,165
for the exact same one.

19
00:00:43,169 --> 00:00:45,046
Do I look like I just woke up?

20
00:00:45,088 --> 00:00:47,382
No.

21
00:00:45,088 --> 00:00:47,382
Great. I'm gonna

22
00:00:45,088 --> 00:00:47,382
go say hey to Raj.

23
00:00:49,092 --> 00:00:50,427
What were you guys

24
00:00:49,092 --> 00:00:50,427
giggling about?

25
00:00:50,468 --> 00:00:52,220
They were passing

26
00:00:50,468 --> 00:00:52,220
notes to each other.

27
00:00:52,262 --> 00:00:54,556
Oh-ho, love notes?

28
00:00:54,596 --> 00:00:56,015
If you love math.

29
00:00:57,016 --> 00:00:59,018
And we do.

30
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:00,853
It's for our

31
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:00,853
super-asymmetry theory.

32
00:01:00,895 --> 00:01:02,355
Yeah, Amy and I have

33
00:01:00,895 --> 00:01:02,355
been having so much fun

34
00:01:02,397 --> 00:01:03,940
collaborating together.

35
00:01:03,981 --> 00:01:05,483
Well, you know what they

36
00:01:03,981 --> 00:01:05,483
say, you never collaborate

37
00:01:05,525 --> 00:01:08,611
as much as your first

38
00:01:05,525 --> 00:01:08,611
year of marriage.

39
00:01:08,652 --> 00:01:10,696
Hey, great show.

40
00:01:08,652 --> 00:01:10,696
Thanks.

41
00:01:10,738 --> 00:01:12,156
Oh, Howard, uh,

42
00:01:10,738 --> 00:01:12,156
this is Andrea.

43
00:01:12,198 --> 00:01:14,451
She's the director

44
00:01:12,198 --> 00:01:14,451
of the planetarium.

45
00:01:12,198 --> 00:01:14,451
Hi.

46
00:01:14,492 --> 00:01:16,119
Nice to meet you.

47
00:01:14,492 --> 00:01:16,119
I'm Howard Wolowitz.

48
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:17,703
Engineer, husband, father...

49
00:01:17,745 --> 00:01:19,414
(chuckles)

50
00:01:17,745 --> 00:01:19,414
astronaut.

51
00:01:20,331 --> 00:01:21,541
Really? You're an astronaut?

52
00:01:21,583 --> 00:01:23,251
Well, I don't like to brag.

53
00:01:23,293 --> 00:01:25,002
Hmm, yeah, but

54
00:01:23,293 --> 00:01:25,002
somehow, you manage.

55
00:01:26,712 --> 00:01:28,839
Raj, you should have Howard

56
00:01:26,712 --> 00:01:28,839
join you for one of your shows.

57
00:01:28,881 --> 00:01:30,592
Oh, that might be fun.

58
00:01:30,633 --> 00:01:32,510
But— it might be, but with

59
00:01:30,633 --> 00:01:32,510
two small children at home

60
00:01:32,552 --> 00:01:34,762
and a full-time job,

61
00:01:32,552 --> 00:01:34,762
I'm sure you're too busy.

62
00:01:34,804 --> 00:01:36,389
No, I could find the time.

63
00:01:36,431 --> 00:01:38,057
Well, you don't have

64
00:01:36,431 --> 00:01:38,057
to decide right now.

65
00:01:36,431 --> 00:01:38,057
It's okay, I...

66
00:01:38,099 --> 00:01:39,767
He can't do it.

67
00:01:39,809 --> 00:01:41,561
Hey, hurry up, guys.

68
00:01:41,603 --> 00:01:43,020
The gift shop's closing,

69
00:01:41,603 --> 00:01:43,020
and Amy said

70
00:01:43,062 --> 00:01:44,939
I can get one big thing

71
00:01:43,062 --> 00:01:44,939
or two little things.

00:02:11,215 --> 00:02:13,343
isolation helmet on you

88
00:02:13,384 --> 00:02:14,718
for about five minutes.

89
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:16,012
All you need to do

90
00:02:16,053 --> 00:02:17,597
is sit still and relax.

91
00:02:17,639 --> 00:02:19,765
What do I do if I start

92
00:02:17,639 --> 00:02:19,765
to get claustrophobic?

93
00:02:19,807 --> 00:02:22,519
Oh, the helmet will sense that

94
00:02:19,807 --> 00:02:22,519
and stop the experiment.

95
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,979
Really?

96
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,979
No, but that would

97
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,979
be cool, wouldn't it?

98
00:02:28,149 --> 00:02:29,609
Amy, are you busy?

99
00:02:29,651 --> 00:02:32,278
I've got a subject wired up

100
00:02:29,651 --> 00:02:32,278
for a sensory study.

101
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,238
So...

102
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:36,449
Yes, I'm busy.

103
00:02:36,491 --> 00:02:37,700
Oh.

104
00:02:37,741 --> 00:02:39,160
I'm tracking a subject's

105
00:02:37,741 --> 00:02:39,160
brain activity

106
00:02:39,202 --> 00:02:41,704
in real time as we

107
00:02:39,202 --> 00:02:41,704
introduce olfactory stimuli.

108
00:02:41,745 --> 00:02:43,789
I'm smelling baby powder.

109
00:02:43,831 --> 00:02:47,168
That's just my husband.

110
00:02:47,210 --> 00:02:50,213
Well, I had a thought about

111
00:02:47,210 --> 00:02:50,213
our super-asymmetry theory.

112
00:02:50,254 --> 00:02:51,464
Let me show you this one thing.

113
00:02:51,506 --> 00:02:52,965
Well, I-I want to see it,

114
00:02:53,007 --> 00:02:54,592
but not when I'm in the middle

115
00:02:53,007 --> 00:02:54,592
of an experiment.

116
00:02:54,634 --> 00:02:57,470
Still baby powder!

117
00:02:57,512 --> 00:03:00,722
Boy, he is annoying. Do any

118
00:02:57,512 --> 00:03:00,722
of those buttons shock him?

119
00:03:00,764 --> 00:03:04,686
Look, I'm really excited

120
00:03:00,764 --> 00:03:04,686
about our paper, too,

121
00:03:04,726 --> 00:03:05,978
but I've got

122
00:03:04,726 --> 00:03:05,978
a lot of my own work

123
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:07,564
to catch up on,

124
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:07,564
so let's talk later.

125
00:03:07,605 --> 00:03:10,441
Okay, I'll just say one

126
00:03:07,605 --> 00:03:10,441
more thing: lambda calculus.

127
00:03:10,483 --> 00:03:12,902
And if that wets your whistle,

128
00:03:10,483 --> 00:03:12,902
you know where to find me.

129
00:03:12,943 --> 00:03:15,196
Boop.

130
00:03:19,242 --> 00:03:22,161
You okay? You seem distracted.

131
00:03:22,203 --> 00:03:25,039
I'm-I'm just thinking about Raj.

132
00:03:25,081 --> 00:03:27,041
I'm thinking about

133
00:03:25,081 --> 00:03:27,041
Chris Hemsworth. Let's go.

134
00:03:29,669 --> 00:03:32,380
He sort of hurt my feelings.

135
00:03:32,422 --> 00:03:36,092
(quietly): Biceps, hammer, abs.

136
00:03:32,422 --> 00:03:36,092
Still in it.

137
00:03:36,133 --> 00:03:39,721
Why wouldn't he want me to be

138
00:03:36,133 --> 00:03:39,721
in his planetarium show?

139
00:03:39,761 --> 00:03:42,056
And it's gone.

140
00:03:42,098 --> 00:03:44,392
Sorry, it's just the director

141
00:03:42,098 --> 00:03:44,392
of the planetarium thought

142
00:03:44,434 --> 00:03:46,728
it'd be fun for me to join Raj

143
00:03:44,434 --> 00:03:46,728
for one of his shows,

144
00:03:46,769 --> 00:03:49,355
and he made it clear

145
00:03:46,769 --> 00:03:49,355
that he didn't want me to.

146
00:03:49,397 --> 00:03:50,732
Of course he wouldn't

147
00:03:49,397 --> 00:03:50,732
want you to.

148
00:03:50,773 --> 00:03:52,442
I mean, think about it.

149
00:03:50,773 --> 00:03:52,442
If you were him,

150
00:03:52,483 --> 00:03:56,571
would you want to share the

151
00:03:52,483 --> 00:03:56,571
stage with a sexy-ass astronaut?

152
00:03:56,613 --> 00:03:58,948
I don't know.

153
00:03:56,613 --> 00:03:58,948
How sexy are we talking?

154
00:03:58,989 --> 00:04:03,953
Oh, you know, tight pants,

155
00:03:58,989 --> 00:04:03,953
huge biceps, magic hammer.

156
00:04:03,994 --> 00:04:07,081
Wait, w-who are we talk...

157
00:04:03,994 --> 00:04:07,081
Shh, I'm back in it.

158
00:04:08,374 --> 00:04:09,917
SHELDON: (stammers)

159
00:04:08,374 --> 00:04:09,917
The fundamental problem

160
00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:12,128
with elementary quantum

161
00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:12,128
mechanical formalism

162
00:04:12,169 --> 00:04:13,755
is that the Fourier transform

163
00:04:13,796 --> 00:04:16,215
extends to minus infinity

164
00:04:13,796 --> 00:04:16,215
in time.

165
00:04:16,257 --> 00:04:19,260
Hey, don't dumb this down

166
00:04:16,257 --> 00:04:19,260
for me.

167
00:04:20,803 --> 00:04:22,472
Penny, I'm...

168
00:04:22,513 --> 00:04:23,640
Late for that thing. See you.

169
00:04:23,681 --> 00:04:24,474
Leonard!

170
00:04:24,515 --> 00:04:26,726
Oh, Sheldon.

171
00:04:26,768 --> 00:04:28,018
Didn't see you there. What's up?

172
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:30,104
Well, uh, he was

173
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:30,104
excited to talk science

174
00:04:30,146 --> 00:04:31,689
with Amy,

175
00:04:30,146 --> 00:04:31,689
but she was working late,

176
00:04:31,731 --> 00:04:34,066
so he decided to come over

177
00:04:31,731 --> 00:04:34,066
and share it with me.

178
00:04:34,108 --> 00:04:37,236
With me, Leonard.

179
00:04:37,278 --> 00:04:39,196
With me.

180
00:04:39,238 --> 00:04:41,949
Sheldon,

181
00:04:39,238 --> 00:04:41,949
we've talked about this.

182
00:04:41,991 --> 00:04:44,827
You can't go around

183
00:04:41,991 --> 00:04:44,827
boring other people's wives.

184
00:04:44,868 --> 00:04:45,953
PENNY:

185
00:04:44,868 --> 00:04:45,953
Yeah.

186
00:04:45,995 --> 00:04:48,665
I already got a man for that.

187
00:04:48,706 --> 00:04:51,417
Yeah, you do.

188
00:04:48,706 --> 00:04:51,417
Yeah.

189
00:04:51,459 --> 00:04:52,502
It's just, I've

190
00:04:51,459 --> 00:04:52,502
just been enjoying

191
00:04:52,543 --> 00:04:53,961
my collaboration with Amy,

192
00:04:54,003 --> 00:04:55,630
but ever since we got back

193
00:04:54,003 --> 00:04:55,630
from our honeymoon,

194
00:04:55,672 --> 00:04:57,173
she has so little time.

195
00:04:57,214 --> 00:04:58,633
Well, she does have her own job.

196
00:04:58,675 --> 00:05:00,259
Yeah, but it's so dull.

197
00:05:00,301 --> 00:05:02,345
Trying to understand

198
00:05:00,301 --> 00:05:02,345
how the brain

199
00:05:02,386 --> 00:05:06,557
translates the five senses

200
00:05:02,386 --> 00:05:06,557
into biochemical information.

201
00:05:06,599 --> 00:05:09,268
I'd rather wait in line

202
00:05:06,599 --> 00:05:09,268
without my phone.

203
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:12,730
Okay, well, Leonard's here now.

204
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:12,730
You can talk science with him.

205
00:05:12,772 --> 00:05:14,023
Where you going?

206
00:05:14,064 --> 00:05:15,525
Oh, that thing

207
00:05:14,064 --> 00:05:15,525
you were late for.

208
00:05:15,566 --> 00:05:18,528
One of us should

209
00:05:15,566 --> 00:05:18,528
really be there.

210
00:05:19,821 --> 00:05:22,114
Hey. Got a sec?

211
00:05:22,156 --> 00:05:23,240
Sure. What's up?

212
00:05:23,282 --> 00:05:25,493
I just want to let

213
00:05:23,282 --> 00:05:25,493
you know I get

214
00:05:25,535 --> 00:05:28,204
why you don't want me to be

215
00:05:25,535 --> 00:05:28,204
a part of the planetarium show.

216
00:05:28,245 --> 00:05:31,582
Oh, great.

217
00:05:28,245 --> 00:05:31,582
Thanks for stopping by.

218
00:05:31,624 --> 00:05:33,376
You don't want to talk

219
00:05:31,624 --> 00:05:33,376
about the stars

220
00:05:33,417 --> 00:05:35,336
next to an actual astronaut.

221
00:05:35,378 --> 00:05:38,214
That would be like doing karaoke

222
00:05:35,378 --> 00:05:38,214
with a rock star.

223
00:05:38,255 --> 00:05:43,010
First of all, I've totally done

224
00:05:38,255 --> 00:05:43,010
karaoke with a rock star.

225
00:05:43,052 --> 00:05:44,804
Or are you forgetting

226
00:05:43,052 --> 00:05:44,804
when the Spin Doctors

227
00:05:44,846 --> 00:05:47,682
handed me the mic

228
00:05:44,846 --> 00:05:47,682
at the Orange County Fair?

229
00:05:47,724 --> 00:05:50,768
Listen, I understand

230
00:05:47,724 --> 00:05:50,768
you being intimidated,

231
00:05:50,810 --> 00:05:53,479
but I can't help that I'm proud

232
00:05:50,810 --> 00:05:53,479
of being an astronaut.

233
00:05:53,521 --> 00:05:54,814
It's a big deal.

234
00:05:54,856 --> 00:05:57,024
Oh, it certainly is,

235
00:05:54,856 --> 00:05:57,024
but I also happen to be

236
00:05:57,066 --> 00:05:59,443
very accomplished in my field.

237
00:05:59,485 --> 00:06:00,862
Great. So you have no reason

238
00:06:00,902 --> 00:06:03,280
to be scared

239
00:06:00,902 --> 00:06:03,280
of sharing the spotlight.

240
00:06:03,322 --> 00:06:06,826
Please. I may be scared

241
00:06:03,322 --> 00:06:06,826
of heights and spiders

242
00:06:06,868 --> 00:06:08,452
and showing up

243
00:06:06,868 --> 00:06:08,452
at a costume party

244
00:06:08,494 --> 00:06:10,204
that turns out

245
00:06:08,494 --> 00:06:10,204
to be a regular party,

246
00:06:10,246 --> 00:06:14,500
but I am not scared of sharing

247
00:06:10,246 --> 00:06:14,500
the spotlight with you!

248
00:06:21,298 --> 00:06:22,842
What's happening?

249
00:06:22,884 --> 00:06:24,886
I just stormed out

250
00:06:22,884 --> 00:06:24,886
for dramatic effect.

251
00:06:24,926 --> 00:06:28,138
I... Actually, I-I don't have

252
00:06:24,926 --> 00:06:28,138
anywhere to go.

253
00:06:30,433 --> 00:06:33,519
President Siebert, how much

254
00:06:30,433 --> 00:06:33,519
do you know about physics?

255
00:06:33,561 --> 00:06:35,229
I'm a physicist.

256
00:06:37,106 --> 00:06:39,692
Huh. I would not

257
00:06:37,106 --> 00:06:39,692
have guessed that.

258
00:06:40,902 --> 00:06:42,528
I have a doctorate

259
00:06:40,902 --> 00:06:42,528
from Indiana University.

260
00:06:42,570 --> 00:06:43,738
Oh, that makes more sense.

261
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:45,489
Well, don't worry, I'll go slow.

262
00:06:45,531 --> 00:06:47,617
Thank you.

263
00:06:47,658 --> 00:06:50,787
Dr. Fowler and I have

264
00:06:47,658 --> 00:06:50,787
been working on

265
00:06:50,828 --> 00:06:52,747
a theory of super-asymmetry

266
00:06:52,789 --> 00:06:55,625
that could reconcile the lack

267
00:06:52,789 --> 00:06:55,625
of observation of supersymmetry

268
00:06:55,666 --> 00:06:57,460
in a world still governed

269
00:06:55,666 --> 00:06:57,460
by string theory.

270
00:06:57,501 --> 00:07:01,923
Interesting. So you're taking

271
00:06:57,501 --> 00:07:01,923
the paradigms of supersymmetry,

272
00:07:01,963 --> 00:07:05,843
but removing the limitations

273
00:07:01,963 --> 00:07:05,843
of obeying the Poincaré algebra.

274
00:07:05,885 --> 00:07:08,137
Well, aren't you just

275
00:07:05,885 --> 00:07:08,137
the pride of Bloomington?

276
00:07:08,178 --> 00:07:10,514
What do you want, Sheldon?

277
00:07:10,556 --> 00:07:12,266
Dr. Fowler has

278
00:07:10,556 --> 00:07:12,266
found herself distracted

279
00:07:12,308 --> 00:07:14,268
by the commitments

280
00:07:12,308 --> 00:07:14,268
in her own lab.

281
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:15,977
It would be a great help

282
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:15,977
to both of us

283
00:07:16,019 --> 00:07:18,230
if you could free her up

284
00:07:16,019 --> 00:07:18,230
from her other projects.

285
00:07:18,272 --> 00:07:21,442
I'm confused.

286
00:07:18,272 --> 00:07:21,442
Yeah, well, there's

287
00:07:18,272 --> 00:07:21,442
that Indiana.

288
00:07:21,484 --> 00:07:24,654
This is physics research.

289
00:07:21,484 --> 00:07:24,654
Dr. Fowler's a neuroscientist.

290
00:07:24,695 --> 00:07:25,822
Y-Yes,

291
00:07:25,863 --> 00:07:27,615
but her insights

292
00:07:25,863 --> 00:07:27,615
into the very ways

293
00:07:27,657 --> 00:07:30,743
we conceptualize symmetry and

294
00:07:27,657 --> 00:07:30,743
asymmetry have been invaluable.

295
00:07:30,785 --> 00:07:32,244
Dr. Cooper...

296
00:07:30,785 --> 00:07:32,244
L-Look, I know

297
00:07:32,286 --> 00:07:33,871
what you're thinking,

298
00:07:32,286 --> 00:07:33,871
that "they're newlyweds,

299
00:07:33,913 --> 00:07:35,665
how are they gonna keep

300
00:07:33,913 --> 00:07:35,665
their hands off of each other?"

301
00:07:35,706 --> 00:07:39,335
Let me assure you, we will not

302
00:07:35,706 --> 00:07:39,335
engage in workplace coitus.

303
00:07:40,503 --> 00:07:41,921
Okay, if I won't

304
00:07:40,503 --> 00:07:41,921
put a bagel on my desk,

305
00:07:41,963 --> 00:07:45,048
I'm certainly not putting

306
00:07:41,963 --> 00:07:45,048
Amy's bare bottom.

307
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:49,679
I-I must say,

308
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:49,679
I do not enjoy our talks.

309
00:07:54,183 --> 00:07:56,602
Dr. Park, may I help you?

310
00:07:56,644 --> 00:07:58,771
Actually, yes, do you have any

311
00:07:56,644 --> 00:07:58,771
better notes on this project?

312
00:07:58,813 --> 00:08:00,898
I'm having a hard time

313
00:07:58,813 --> 00:08:00,898
reading your handwriting.

314
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:02,608
Oh, uh, allow me

315
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:02,608
to rephrase that.

316
00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:04,944
What the hell

317
00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:04,944
are you doing in my lab?

318
00:08:04,986 --> 00:08:08,572
I'm sorry, I was reassigned

319
00:08:04,986 --> 00:08:08,572
to this project.

320
00:08:08,614 --> 00:08:09,532
I was told you were taking

321
00:08:09,573 --> 00:08:10,574
a temporary sabbatical

322
00:08:10,616 --> 00:08:11,617
to focus on other work.

323
00:08:11,659 --> 00:08:13,536
N-No, that-that's crazy.

324
00:08:13,577 --> 00:08:14,871
This is my research.

325
00:08:14,912 --> 00:08:18,081
Oh, Amy, there you are.

326
00:08:14,912 --> 00:08:18,081
No, not...

327
00:08:18,123 --> 00:08:21,126
Not now, Sheldon, I'm dealing

328
00:08:18,123 --> 00:08:21,126
with an epic screwup,

329
00:08:21,168 --> 00:08:22,211
and when I find out

330
00:08:21,168 --> 00:08:22,211
who's responsible,

331
00:08:22,252 --> 00:08:23,629
they're gonna get an earful.

332
00:08:23,671 --> 00:08:24,881
All right, well,

333
00:08:23,671 --> 00:08:24,881
when you're done, let me know,

334
00:08:24,922 --> 00:08:26,256
I've got some exciting news.

335
00:08:26,298 --> 00:08:28,050
I'm sorry, I'm confused.

336
00:08:26,298 --> 00:08:28,050
President Siebert said

337
00:08:28,091 --> 00:08:30,135
you were focusing on

338
00:08:28,091 --> 00:08:30,135
some important physics work

339
00:08:30,177 --> 00:08:32,262
and I should take over

340
00:08:30,177 --> 00:08:32,262
your lab in the interim.

341
00:08:32,304 --> 00:08:34,515
Uh, hey, that was

342
00:08:32,304 --> 00:08:34,515
my exciting news.

343
00:08:35,850 --> 00:08:36,893
All right, I'm gonna

344
00:08:35,850 --> 00:08:36,893
tell you again.

345
00:08:36,934 --> 00:08:38,185
Pretend you haven't heard it.

346
00:08:42,147 --> 00:08:43,816
You got me removed

347
00:08:42,147 --> 00:08:43,816
from my own project?

348
00:08:43,858 --> 00:08:45,234
Yeah, and it wasn't easy.

349
00:08:45,275 --> 00:08:47,361
Apparently, you're very

350
00:08:45,275 --> 00:08:47,361
difficult to replace.

351
00:08:47,403 --> 00:08:49,446
Hey, just between you and me,

352
00:08:49,488 --> 00:08:52,992
they consider Dr. Park

353
00:08:49,488 --> 00:08:52,992
quite the step down.

354
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:59,415
I was trying to pick my moment

355
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:59,415
to leave. This seems like it.

356
00:08:59,456 --> 00:09:02,585
Wow. Banker's hours.

357
00:09:02,626 --> 00:09:05,546
No wonder you're not

358
00:09:02,626 --> 00:09:05,546
on the tenure track.

359
00:09:05,588 --> 00:09:07,840
Sheldon, you had no right.

360
00:09:07,882 --> 00:09:09,717
What— I thought you said

361
00:09:07,882 --> 00:09:09,717
you were spread too thin.

362
00:09:09,759 --> 00:09:11,093
You said that you wished

363
00:09:09,759 --> 00:09:11,093
you had more time to focus

364
00:09:11,134 --> 00:09:13,178
on our research.

365
00:09:11,134 --> 00:09:13,178
I thought I was helping.

366
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:14,471
Well, you're not.

367
00:09:14,513 --> 00:09:16,933
I mean, I have years

368
00:09:14,513 --> 00:09:16,933
invested in this work,

369
00:09:16,974 --> 00:09:19,351
and now someone's gonna

370
00:09:16,974 --> 00:09:19,351
come in and take it over?

371
00:09:19,393 --> 00:09:21,604
I mean, how would you feel

372
00:09:19,393 --> 00:09:21,604
if I let Leonard take over

373
00:09:21,645 --> 00:09:23,146
your super-asymmetry project?

374
00:09:23,188 --> 00:09:24,732
(laughs)

375
00:09:23,188 --> 00:09:24,732
That's funny.

376
00:09:26,191 --> 00:09:29,570
Oh, he'd be like a puppy

377
00:09:26,191 --> 00:09:29,570
with a microscope. (laughs)

378
00:09:30,613 --> 00:09:32,239
(chuckles)

379
00:09:32,281 --> 00:09:37,078
If I had a nickel for every time

380
00:09:32,281 --> 00:09:37,078
a charity sent me a nickel.

381
00:09:39,121 --> 00:09:42,083
Really? That's gonna be

382
00:09:39,121 --> 00:09:42,083
our whole life, huh?

383
00:09:43,584 --> 00:09:45,335
If my father's any guide,

384
00:09:43,584 --> 00:09:45,335
around 50,

385
00:09:45,377 --> 00:09:48,338
I start to lose my hearing

386
00:09:45,377 --> 00:09:48,338
and get two new jokes.

387
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:49,256
(knock on door)

388
00:09:49,298 --> 00:09:51,842
Hey.

389
00:09:49,298 --> 00:09:51,842
Hey.

390
00:09:51,884 --> 00:09:53,260
I brought Chinese.

391
00:09:53,302 --> 00:09:55,512
Oh, that's a nice surprise.

392
00:09:53,302 --> 00:09:55,512
What's the occasion?

393
00:09:55,554 --> 00:09:58,515
Please, I don't need a reason

394
00:09:55,554 --> 00:09:58,515
to bring food to my friends.

395
00:09:58,557 --> 00:10:00,183
But you have one, don't you?

396
00:10:00,225 --> 00:10:01,811
Yeah, I need your help.

397
00:10:01,852 --> 00:10:04,105
All right, lay it on us.

398
00:10:04,146 --> 00:10:06,356
So, I folded,

399
00:10:06,398 --> 00:10:07,858
and I told Howard

400
00:10:06,398 --> 00:10:07,858
he could be a part

401
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:09,443
of my planetarium show.

402
00:10:09,485 --> 00:10:10,694
And now I'm worried

403
00:10:09,485 --> 00:10:10,694
he's just gonna

404
00:10:10,736 --> 00:10:12,655
make the whole thing

405
00:10:10,736 --> 00:10:12,655
about himself.

406
00:10:12,696 --> 00:10:13,948
So just tell him

407
00:10:12,696 --> 00:10:13,948
you changed your mind

408
00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:15,407
and you don't

409
00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:15,407
want him to do it.

410
00:10:15,449 --> 00:10:16,993
No, no, then he's gonna think

411
00:10:15,449 --> 00:10:16,993
I'm too insecure

412
00:10:17,034 --> 00:10:18,119
to share the spotlight with him.

413
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,578
And he'd be right.

414
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:21,789
I came here

415
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:21,789
for your support.

416
00:10:21,831 --> 00:10:23,124
Well, then, you just walked up

417
00:10:23,165 --> 00:10:24,583
three flights of stairs

418
00:10:23,165 --> 00:10:24,583
for nothing.

419
00:10:24,625 --> 00:10:27,210
Wait, don't you mean

420
00:10:24,625 --> 00:10:27,210
four flights?

421
00:10:27,252 --> 00:10:28,504
No, it's actually three.

422
00:10:28,545 --> 00:10:30,506
But we're on the fourth floor.

423
00:10:30,547 --> 00:10:31,924
I mean, you have the lobby,

424
00:10:30,547 --> 00:10:31,924
first floor,

425
00:10:31,966 --> 00:10:33,009
second, third, fourth.

426
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:34,551
The lobby's the first floor,

427
00:10:34,593 --> 00:10:35,845
so lobby, second, third, fourth.

428
00:10:35,886 --> 00:10:37,680
That does not seem right.

429
00:10:37,721 --> 00:10:39,890
Hello...

430
00:10:39,932 --> 00:10:43,102
Sorry, Raj, who cares if

431
00:10:39,932 --> 00:10:43,102
Howard tries to steal the show?

432
00:10:43,144 --> 00:10:44,561
All right? You're great

433
00:10:43,144 --> 00:10:44,561
at what you do.

434
00:10:44,603 --> 00:10:46,105
Just be the bigger man.

435
00:10:46,147 --> 00:10:47,815
And if it makes you feel better,

436
00:10:46,147 --> 00:10:47,815
Penny and I will come

437
00:10:47,857 --> 00:10:49,483
so you'll have a couple of

438
00:10:47,857 --> 00:10:49,483
friendly faces in the audience.

439
00:10:49,525 --> 00:10:51,027
Thank you.

440
00:10:49,525 --> 00:10:51,027
That would be nice.

441
00:10:51,068 --> 00:10:52,987
Can you just...

442
00:10:51,068 --> 00:10:52,987
Sorry, give me a minute?

443
00:11:00,828 --> 00:11:03,372
Hey, Raj, if I had a nickel

444
00:11:00,828 --> 00:11:03,372
for every time

445
00:11:03,413 --> 00:11:05,791
a charity sent me a nickel...

446
00:11:07,209 --> 00:11:08,919
That's hilarious!

447
00:11:08,961 --> 00:11:10,212
I know.

448
00:11:13,674 --> 00:11:15,718
(exhales)

449
00:11:15,759 --> 00:11:17,094
It's three, right?

450
00:11:17,136 --> 00:11:20,014
Just shut up.

451
00:11:21,222 --> 00:11:23,059
Oh, good,

452
00:11:21,222 --> 00:11:23,059
we caught you.

453
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:25,519
Yes, good.

454
00:11:25,561 --> 00:11:27,980
You had no right

455
00:11:25,561 --> 00:11:27,980
to reassign my project.

456
00:11:28,022 --> 00:11:29,106
Yeah, no right at all.

457
00:11:29,148 --> 00:11:30,691
Dr. Fowler,

458
00:11:29,148 --> 00:11:30,691
I don't understand.

459
00:11:30,733 --> 00:11:32,735
Dr. Cooper assured me

460
00:11:30,733 --> 00:11:32,735
this is what you wanted.

461
00:11:32,776 --> 00:11:34,403
Oh-oh! Can you

462
00:11:32,776 --> 00:11:34,403
believe this guy?

463
00:11:34,444 --> 00:11:35,905
Oh, sure,

464
00:11:35,946 --> 00:11:38,407
so a couple of men get together

465
00:11:35,946 --> 00:11:38,407
behind closed doors

466
00:11:38,448 --> 00:11:40,159
to decide the fate

467
00:11:38,448 --> 00:11:40,159
of a woman's career.

468
00:11:40,201 --> 00:11:41,493
I thought we'd

469
00:11:40,201 --> 00:11:41,493
moved past this.

470
00:11:41,535 --> 00:11:44,245
Sheldon, this is

471
00:11:41,535 --> 00:11:44,245
your fault.

472
00:11:44,287 --> 00:11:45,539
Ooh, sounds like

473
00:11:44,287 --> 00:11:45,539
the old lady's

474
00:11:45,581 --> 00:11:47,124
putting me in the

475
00:11:45,581 --> 00:11:47,124
doghouse tonight.

476
00:11:47,166 --> 00:11:48,918
Dr. Fowler,

477
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:50,586
you are very important

478
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:50,586
to this university

479
00:11:50,627 --> 00:11:52,629
and I would like

480
00:11:50,627 --> 00:11:52,629
to sincerely apologize.

481
00:11:52,671 --> 00:11:54,757
So I can have

482
00:11:52,671 --> 00:11:54,757
my project back?

483
00:11:54,798 --> 00:11:56,425
I'm afraid it's

484
00:11:54,798 --> 00:11:56,425
not that simple.

485
00:11:54,798 --> 00:11:56,425
Why not?

486
00:11:56,466 --> 00:11:58,343
Well, in order

487
00:11:56,466 --> 00:11:58,343
to free up personnel...

488
00:11:58,385 --> 00:12:01,764
Hey, hey, don't go

489
00:11:58,385 --> 00:12:01,764
mansplaining things to her.

490
00:12:01,805 --> 00:12:03,891
I don't think that's

491
00:12:01,805 --> 00:12:03,891
what he was doing.

492
00:12:03,933 --> 00:12:05,308
Oh, then perhaps

493
00:12:03,933 --> 00:12:05,308
you don't understand.

494
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:07,352
See, mansplaining is when

495
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:07,352
a man explains things

496
00:12:07,394 --> 00:12:08,854
to a woman like

497
00:12:07,394 --> 00:12:08,854
she's stupid.

498
00:12:11,065 --> 00:12:13,400
Boop.

499
00:12:14,693 --> 00:12:16,528
So when was the last time

500
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:18,989
you saw Howard in his

501
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:18,989
astronaut uniform?

502
00:12:19,031 --> 00:12:20,741
About a week ago.

503
00:12:20,783 --> 00:12:22,201
Really? What was

504
00:12:20,783 --> 00:12:22,201
the occasion?

505
00:12:22,243 --> 00:12:23,911
Date night.

506
00:12:25,121 --> 00:12:26,413
We do a little role-playing.

507
00:12:26,455 --> 00:12:28,289
What role

508
00:12:26,455 --> 00:12:28,289
do you play?

509
00:12:28,331 --> 00:12:32,335
(Russian accent):

510
00:12:28,331 --> 00:12:32,335
I am Ykatarina Nazdorovya,

511
00:12:32,377 --> 00:12:35,338
lonely Russian cosmonaut

512
00:12:32,377 --> 00:12:35,338
who is expert at physics

513
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:37,424
and making love.

514
00:12:39,218 --> 00:12:43,304
Okay, that just made

515
00:12:39,218 --> 00:12:43,304
the next hour really weird.

516
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:48,269
Good evening,

517
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:48,269
I am Dr. Rajesh Koothrappali,

518
00:12:48,309 --> 00:12:51,230
and usually I take you on a trip

519
00:12:48,309 --> 00:12:51,230
through the stars,

520
00:12:51,272 --> 00:12:53,440
but tonight,

521
00:12:51,272 --> 00:12:53,440
we'll begin our journey

522
00:12:53,482 --> 00:12:56,526
much closer to home, 220 miles

523
00:12:56,568 --> 00:12:59,320
straight up to

524
00:12:56,568 --> 00:12:59,320
the International Space Station,

525
00:12:59,362 --> 00:13:02,908
which is manned by a team

526
00:12:59,362 --> 00:13:02,908
of brave men and women.

527
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:05,286
(Russian accent):

528
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:05,286
Flexible men and women.

529
00:13:05,326 --> 00:13:06,996
Switch with me.

530
00:13:07,037 --> 00:13:09,832
KOOTHRAPPALI:

531
00:13:07,037 --> 00:13:09,832
And we are fortunate

532
00:13:09,873 --> 00:13:13,169
to have one of those men

533
00:13:09,873 --> 00:13:13,169
here with us tonight.

534
00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:15,963
Please welcome to

535
00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:15,963
the Griffith Observatory

536
00:13:16,005 --> 00:13:18,299
astronaut Howard Joel Wolowitz.

537
00:13:21,551 --> 00:13:24,138
Kak horosho.

538
00:13:25,806 --> 00:13:28,809
What is she ta...

539
00:13:25,806 --> 00:13:28,809
Don't ask.

540
00:13:28,851 --> 00:13:32,104
Thank you, Raj, that was

541
00:13:28,851 --> 00:13:32,104
a really nice introduction.

542
00:13:32,146 --> 00:13:33,354
Well, it's from my heart.

543
00:13:33,396 --> 00:13:37,276
So, Howard, you are

544
00:13:33,396 --> 00:13:37,276
in an elite group.

545
00:13:37,318 --> 00:13:40,570
Only 232 people

546
00:13:37,318 --> 00:13:40,570
have ever been on

547
00:13:40,612 --> 00:13:43,115
the International Space

548
00:13:40,612 --> 00:13:43,115
Station. How does that

549
00:13:43,157 --> 00:13:44,533
make you feel?

550
00:13:44,574 --> 00:13:46,994
Honestly, lucky.

551
00:13:47,036 --> 00:13:49,038
Most astronauts have to

552
00:13:47,036 --> 00:13:49,038
train their whole lives.

553
00:13:49,079 --> 00:13:52,041
I was just in the right

554
00:13:49,079 --> 00:13:52,041
place at the right time.

555
00:13:52,082 --> 00:13:54,626
Oh, please, luck had

556
00:13:52,082 --> 00:13:54,626
nothing to do with it.

557
00:13:54,668 --> 00:13:57,171
You people need to know

558
00:13:54,668 --> 00:13:57,171
how impressive

559
00:13:57,213 --> 00:13:58,922
this man is.

560
00:13:57,213 --> 00:13:58,922
He was up there

561
00:13:58,964 --> 00:14:01,675
because he's the

562
00:13:58,964 --> 00:14:01,675
only one qualified

563
00:14:01,717 --> 00:14:04,011
to install a piece of

564
00:14:01,717 --> 00:14:04,011
equipment that he designed.

565
00:14:04,053 --> 00:14:06,263
Thanks, but if you want

566
00:14:04,053 --> 00:14:06,263
to talk impressive,

567
00:14:06,305 --> 00:14:08,473
this guy right here

568
00:14:06,305 --> 00:14:08,473
discovered a planetary object

569
00:14:08,515 --> 00:14:09,850
outside the

570
00:14:08,515 --> 00:14:09,850
Kuiper belt.

571
00:14:09,892 --> 00:14:11,352
He worked on

572
00:14:09,892 --> 00:14:11,352
the Mars rover.

573
00:14:11,392 --> 00:14:13,562
He helped launch the

574
00:14:11,392 --> 00:14:13,562
New Horizons space probe.

575
00:14:13,603 --> 00:14:17,107
He went to space

576
00:14:13,603 --> 00:14:17,107
on a Russian rocket.

577
00:14:17,149 --> 00:14:19,568
And I was scared

578
00:14:17,149 --> 00:14:19,568
the whole time.

579
00:14:19,609 --> 00:14:23,572
And I was scared for you,

580
00:14:19,609 --> 00:14:23,572
but also proud.

581
00:14:23,613 --> 00:14:27,034
Wow.

582
00:14:27,076 --> 00:14:29,494
I don't think you've ever

583
00:14:27,076 --> 00:14:29,494
said that to me before.

584
00:14:29,536 --> 00:14:31,372
I should have,

585
00:14:31,413 --> 00:14:33,832
and I'm gonna

586
00:14:31,413 --> 00:14:33,832
say it again.

587
00:14:33,874 --> 00:14:35,209
I'm proud of you.

588
00:14:35,251 --> 00:14:37,961
You're my best friend,

589
00:14:35,251 --> 00:14:37,961
and I love you.

590
00:14:38,003 --> 00:14:41,506
Aw, Raj,

591
00:14:38,003 --> 00:14:41,506
I love you, too.

592
00:14:41,548 --> 00:14:44,927
What is happening?

593
00:14:44,968 --> 00:14:49,556
Bring it in, spaceman,

594
00:14:44,968 --> 00:14:49,556
you've been cleared for landing.

595
00:14:52,768 --> 00:14:55,979
Can you believe these two...

596
00:14:52,768 --> 00:14:55,979
Are you crying?

597
00:14:52,768 --> 00:14:55,979
(crying)

598
00:15:04,196 --> 00:15:06,198
Hello, Sheldon.

599
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,950
Hello, Arthur.

600
00:15:07,991 --> 00:15:11,245
Now, I'm confused, usually when

601
00:15:07,991 --> 00:15:11,245
you appear to me in my dreams,

602
00:15:11,287 --> 00:15:12,829
we're on the planet Dagobah.

603
00:15:12,871 --> 00:15:14,998
This is Dagobah.

604
00:15:18,919 --> 00:15:21,588
I didn't know that Dagobah

605
00:15:18,919 --> 00:15:21,588
had delicatessens.

606
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:24,258
Not good ones.

607
00:15:25,175 --> 00:15:26,843
Whatever you do,

608
00:15:26,885 --> 00:15:29,846
don't order the Reuben.

609
00:15:29,888 --> 00:15:33,058
I'm having a problem

610
00:15:29,888 --> 00:15:33,058
in my marriage.

611
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:36,561
I've upset my wife and I don't

612
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:36,561
know how to make it right.

613
00:15:36,603 --> 00:15:40,357
(chuckles) And you're... and

614
00:15:36,603 --> 00:15:40,357
you're coming to me for advice?

615
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:44,945
I-I upset my wife every time

616
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:44,945
I woke up in the morning.

617
00:15:44,987 --> 00:15:47,823
I'm not coming to you,

618
00:15:47,864 --> 00:15:50,159
you're just a manifestation

619
00:15:47,864 --> 00:15:50,159
of my subconscious.

620
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,868
I mean,

621
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,868
I'm actually coming to me.

622
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:55,414
So you know everything

623
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:55,414
I'm going to say.

624
00:15:55,456 --> 00:15:57,207
Yes, but it sounds

625
00:15:55,456 --> 00:15:57,207
wiser from you

626
00:15:57,249 --> 00:15:59,335
because you're old and glowing.

627
00:15:59,376 --> 00:16:00,461
Fine.

628
00:16:00,502 --> 00:16:03,046
Rule number one

629
00:16:00,502 --> 00:16:03,046
in a marriage:

630
00:16:03,088 --> 00:16:04,923
don't go to bed angry.

631
00:16:04,965 --> 00:16:07,468
That makes sense.

632
00:16:07,509 --> 00:16:09,970
Rule number two in a marriage:

633
00:16:10,012 --> 00:16:13,682
if you don't recognize

634
00:16:10,012 --> 00:16:13,682
the shoes under your bed,

635
00:16:13,723 --> 00:16:16,059
they're not your shoes.

636
00:16:16,101 --> 00:16:19,562
Because they're her shoes?

637
00:16:19,604 --> 00:16:21,564
(sighs) N-Never mind,

638
00:16:21,606 --> 00:16:24,651
just-just go with

639
00:16:21,606 --> 00:16:24,651
rule number one.

640
00:16:24,693 --> 00:16:26,820
Thank you, Arthur.

641
00:16:26,862 --> 00:16:29,781
Uh, before you go,

642
00:16:26,862 --> 00:16:29,781
can I ask you a question?

643
00:16:29,823 --> 00:16:30,866
Of course.

644
00:16:30,907 --> 00:16:34,161
Does this look lean to you?

645
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:38,081
I ordered lean.

646
00:16:39,082 --> 00:16:41,210
Amy. Wake up. Amy.

647
00:16:41,251 --> 00:16:42,503
What? What's wrong?

648
00:16:42,544 --> 00:16:44,421
We can't go to sleep

649
00:16:42,544 --> 00:16:44,421
angry with each other.

650
00:16:44,463 --> 00:16:45,422
Why not?

651
00:16:45,464 --> 00:16:46,965
It's rule number one.

652
00:16:47,007 --> 00:16:49,468
I'd tell you rule number two,

653
00:16:47,007 --> 00:16:49,468
but it's confusing.

654
00:16:49,510 --> 00:16:51,678
Sheldon,

655
00:16:49,510 --> 00:16:51,678
go to sleep.

656
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:55,932
Amy. Amy. Amy.

657
00:16:55,974 --> 00:16:58,601
You cut that out!

658
00:16:58,643 --> 00:17:00,521
Oh, good, you're up.

659
00:17:00,562 --> 00:17:02,856
Sheldon...

660
00:17:02,898 --> 00:17:05,317
I just really don't want to talk

661
00:17:02,898 --> 00:17:05,317
to you about this right now.

662
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:06,276
That's fine.

663
00:17:06,318 --> 00:17:07,569
I just need

664
00:17:06,318 --> 00:17:07,569
you to know

665
00:17:07,610 --> 00:17:09,571
that I feel terrible

666
00:17:07,610 --> 00:17:09,571
about what I did

667
00:17:09,612 --> 00:17:11,532
and I wasn't

668
00:17:09,612 --> 00:17:11,532
being malicious.

669
00:17:11,573 --> 00:17:13,658
No, you were being selfish.

670
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:15,077
You're being selfish right now

671
00:17:15,118 --> 00:17:17,120
'cause it's really late

672
00:17:15,118 --> 00:17:17,120
and I just want to sleep.

673
00:17:17,162 --> 00:17:19,415
No, Professor Proton

674
00:17:17,162 --> 00:17:19,415
came to me in my dream

675
00:17:19,456 --> 00:17:21,124
and said we can't

676
00:17:19,456 --> 00:17:21,124
go to sleep angry.

677
00:17:21,166 --> 00:17:22,876
Are you sure

678
00:17:21,166 --> 00:17:22,876
that's what he said?

679
00:17:22,918 --> 00:17:24,044
Close your eyes,

680
00:17:22,918 --> 00:17:24,044
double-check.

681
00:17:24,086 --> 00:17:28,965
Amy, this is

682
00:17:24,086 --> 00:17:28,965
important.

683
00:17:29,007 --> 00:17:33,345
Okay, listen to me.

684
00:17:33,387 --> 00:17:36,973
I love working with you,

685
00:17:37,015 --> 00:17:40,102
but you have to understand

686
00:17:37,015 --> 00:17:40,102
how scary this is for me.

687
00:17:40,143 --> 00:17:41,811
Why?

688
00:17:41,853 --> 00:17:46,525
Because I don't want to get lost

689
00:17:41,853 --> 00:17:46,525
in this relationship.

690
00:17:46,567 --> 00:17:48,693
And when you pulled me

691
00:17:46,567 --> 00:17:48,693
off my project,

692
00:17:48,735 --> 00:17:51,280
it seemed like my biggest

693
00:17:48,735 --> 00:17:51,280
fear was coming true,

694
00:17:51,321 --> 00:17:54,616
the-the things that are mine

695
00:17:51,321 --> 00:17:54,616
are getting subsumed

696
00:17:54,657 --> 00:17:56,577
into the things

697
00:17:54,657 --> 00:17:56,577
that are ours.

698
00:17:56,618 --> 00:17:59,413
I wouldn't want that

699
00:17:56,618 --> 00:17:59,413
to happen, either.

700
00:17:59,455 --> 00:18:01,706
Thank you for explaining

701
00:18:01,748 --> 00:18:03,125
and for using

702
00:18:01,748 --> 00:18:03,125
the word "subsume,"

703
00:18:03,166 --> 00:18:04,793
that's one you

704
00:18:03,166 --> 00:18:04,793
don't hear enough.

705
00:18:04,834 --> 00:18:08,297
You're welcome.

706
00:18:08,338 --> 00:18:10,340
Good night.

707
00:18:08,338 --> 00:18:10,340
Good night.

708
00:18:14,970 --> 00:18:16,430
What are you

709
00:18:14,970 --> 00:18:16,430
doing now?

710
00:18:16,472 --> 00:18:18,181
Looking for shoes.

711
00:18:18,223 --> 00:18:19,891
Why?

712
00:18:19,933 --> 00:18:22,685
When your favorite ghost tells

713
00:18:19,933 --> 00:18:22,685
you to do something, you do it.
