1
00:00:08,829 --> 00:00:09,872
Previously on

2
00:00:08,829 --> 00:00:09,872
The Big Bang Theory...

3
00:00:09,914 --> 00:00:11,124
We just published

4
00:00:09,914 --> 00:00:11,124
a few months ago.

5
00:00:11,165 --> 00:00:13,418
How did you have time

6
00:00:11,165 --> 00:00:13,418
to design an experiment?

7
00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:16,588
This whole thing is

8
00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:16,588
actually a gigantic accident.

9
00:00:16,629 --> 00:00:19,424
You weren't even thinking

10
00:00:16,629 --> 00:00:19,424
about super-asymmetry?

11
00:00:19,466 --> 00:00:20,758
Thinking about it?

12
00:00:19,466 --> 00:00:20,758
(chuckles)

13
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:23,970
We don't even understand it.

14
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:23,970
(both laugh)

15
00:00:24,011 --> 00:00:25,555
Uh, can you believe this?

16
00:00:25,597 --> 00:00:27,307
Doctors Pemberton and

17
00:00:25,597 --> 00:00:27,307
Campbell have been doing

18
00:00:27,348 --> 00:00:30,101
a press tour trying to take

19
00:00:27,348 --> 00:00:30,101
credit for super-asymmetry.

20
00:00:30,143 --> 00:00:32,186
So what? I mean, no one's

21
00:00:30,143 --> 00:00:32,186
gonna give them credit

22
00:00:32,228 --> 00:00:34,230
for accidentally

23
00:00:32,228 --> 00:00:34,230
discovering something.

24
00:00:34,272 --> 00:00:35,273
WOLOWITZ:

25
00:00:34,272 --> 00:00:35,273
Yeah, who remembers the guy

26
00:00:35,315 --> 00:00:36,399
who was trying to find India

27
00:00:36,441 --> 00:00:37,984
and discovered America instead?

28
00:00:38,025 --> 00:00:39,860
What was his name again?

29
00:00:38,025 --> 00:00:39,860
(chuckles)

30
00:00:39,902 --> 00:00:41,862
Now stop trying to steal

31
00:00:39,902 --> 00:00:41,862
our Nobel Prize.

32
00:00:41,904 --> 00:00:43,823
You come up with your own idea.

33
00:00:43,864 --> 00:00:45,741
Yeah, that's not gonna happen.

34
00:00:48,286 --> 00:00:49,621
ELLEN (over TV): Have a seat,

35
00:00:48,286 --> 00:00:49,621
thanks for being here.

36
00:00:49,661 --> 00:00:51,998
I feel the same way about you.

37
00:00:52,039 --> 00:00:53,458
This is nice.

38
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:56,252
All my friends hanging out,

39
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:56,252
watching Ellen.

40
00:00:56,294 --> 00:01:00,298
It's like, what am I gonna do

41
00:00:56,294 --> 00:01:00,298
with my other two wishes?

42
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:02,300
It's not nice.

43
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:02,300
She's having on the scientists

44
00:01:02,342 --> 00:01:04,511
who are trying to steal

45
00:01:02,342 --> 00:01:04,511
our Nobel Prize.

46
00:01:04,552 --> 00:01:06,137
Although I will enjoy

47
00:01:04,552 --> 00:01:06,137
watching her expose

48
00:01:06,179 --> 00:01:07,680
Pemberton and Campbell

49
00:01:07,721 --> 00:01:10,308
for the coattail-riding

50
00:01:07,721 --> 00:01:10,308
frauds that they are.

51
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:13,019
That is Ellen's brand,

52
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:13,019
gotcha journalism.

53
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:14,979
Yeah, you should've

54
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:14,979
seen her take down

55
00:01:15,021 --> 00:01:16,481
John Krasinski last week.

56
00:01:16,523 --> 00:01:19,900
Got him to admit he loved

57
00:01:16,523 --> 00:01:19,900
his wife. It was brutal.

58
00:01:19,942 --> 00:01:21,486
(shushing)

59
00:01:19,942 --> 00:01:21,486
All right, our next guests

60
00:01:21,528 --> 00:01:23,112
are a couple of physicists—

61
00:01:21,528 --> 00:01:23,112
don't turn the channel.

62
00:01:23,154 --> 00:01:25,781
They've been doing

63
00:01:23,154 --> 00:01:25,781
some viral videos online

64
00:01:25,823 --> 00:01:28,742
about what it's like to be in

65
00:01:25,823 --> 00:01:28,742
the running for a Nobel Prize.

66
00:01:28,784 --> 00:01:30,870
Please welcome

67
00:01:28,784 --> 00:01:30,870
Doctors Greg Pemberton

68
00:01:30,911 --> 00:01:32,372
and Kevin Campbell.

69
00:01:32,413 --> 00:01:34,874
(cheering, applause)

70
00:01:36,459 --> 00:01:38,794
Why does she even want

71
00:01:36,459 --> 00:01:38,794
to have scientists on?

72
00:01:38,836 --> 00:01:41,088
Uh, silly question. Who

73
00:01:38,836 --> 00:01:41,088
else will give her audience

74
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:43,924
causal explanations of

75
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:43,924
natural phenomena?

76
00:01:43,966 --> 00:01:46,802
I love you, honey, but think.

77
00:01:46,844 --> 00:01:48,513
So you guys

78
00:01:48,555 --> 00:01:51,140
have discovered something

79
00:01:48,555 --> 00:01:51,140
pretty amazing in the universe.

80
00:01:51,182 --> 00:01:53,685
Obviously, I understand, uh,

81
00:01:51,182 --> 00:01:53,685
high-level physics

82
00:01:53,725 --> 00:01:56,812
because I'm a comedian, but...

83
00:01:53,725 --> 00:01:56,812
(laughter)

84
00:01:56,854 --> 00:01:58,814
can you explain it

85
00:01:56,854 --> 00:01:58,814
to the audience?

86
00:01:58,856 --> 00:02:01,067
Well, I don't know, I'm not

87
00:01:58,856 --> 00:02:01,067
sure we're even smart enough

88
00:02:01,108 --> 00:02:02,402
to understand it.

89
00:02:01,108 --> 00:02:02,402
(laughter)

90
00:02:04,237 --> 00:02:07,031
Look, look, the audience is

91
00:02:04,237 --> 00:02:07,031
laughing at them. It's starting.

92
00:02:07,073 --> 00:02:10,368
I hate to say it, Sheldon, but

93
00:02:07,073 --> 00:02:10,368
I think the audience likes them.

94
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:12,912
Well, that will all change

95
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:12,912
when Ellen asks them

96
00:02:12,953 --> 00:02:15,873
how super-asymmetry explains the

97
00:02:12,953 --> 00:02:15,873
cosmological excess of matter

98
00:02:15,915 --> 00:02:17,750
over anti-matter

99
00:02:15,915 --> 00:02:17,750
and they panic,

100
00:02:17,791 --> 00:02:20,545
like Leonard trying

101
00:02:17,791 --> 00:02:20,545
to do a pull-up.

102
00:02:20,587 --> 00:02:22,255
Hey, what'd I do?

103
00:02:22,296 --> 00:02:25,091
Not a pull-up.

104
00:02:25,132 --> 00:02:26,634
People have been

105
00:02:25,132 --> 00:02:26,634
loving your videos,

106
00:02:26,676 --> 00:02:28,428
especially the-the songs

107
00:02:26,676 --> 00:02:28,428
that you've been posting.

108
00:02:28,469 --> 00:02:29,970
Oh, thanks.

109
00:02:28,469 --> 00:02:29,970
Thank you.

110
00:02:30,012 --> 00:02:32,515
Uh, this may be pushing

111
00:02:30,012 --> 00:02:32,515
it, but I have to ask.

112
00:02:32,557 --> 00:02:35,101
Would you mind singing one

113
00:02:32,557 --> 00:02:35,101
of those for us right now?

114
00:02:35,142 --> 00:02:37,478
Oh, why not?

115
00:02:35,142 --> 00:02:37,478
All right.

116
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:41,023
Come on, Ellen, they're right

117
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:41,023

Doctors Pemberton and Campbell.

142
00:03:27,903 --> 00:03:29,280
Morning, buddy.

143
00:03:29,322 --> 00:03:30,822
I am not your buddy.

144
00:03:30,864 --> 00:03:33,033
What's wrong?

145
00:03:30,864 --> 00:03:33,033
I'll tell you

146
00:03:30,864 --> 00:03:33,033
what's wrong.

147
00:03:33,075 --> 00:03:35,953
You went on TV

148
00:03:33,075 --> 00:03:35,953
and were charming.

149
00:03:35,995 --> 00:03:37,997
Thanks, man.

150
00:03:35,995 --> 00:03:37,997
That's what my mom said.

151
00:03:38,038 --> 00:03:39,332
PEMBERTON:

152
00:03:38,038 --> 00:03:39,332
W-Why don't you come in

153
00:03:39,373 --> 00:03:41,501
and have some parfait?

154
00:03:39,373 --> 00:03:41,501
Yeah,

155
00:03:41,542 --> 00:03:43,795
we ordered it from room service;

156
00:03:41,542 --> 00:03:43,795
it cost, like, 12 bucks.

157
00:03:43,836 --> 00:03:46,339
It's just yogurt in a glass.

158
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:48,549
I don't want your yogurt.

159
00:03:48,591 --> 00:03:49,883
Then what do you want?

160
00:03:49,925 --> 00:03:51,678
I want you to hold

161
00:03:49,925 --> 00:03:51,678
a press conference

162
00:03:51,719 --> 00:03:54,013
where you admit that you blindly

163
00:03:51,719 --> 00:03:54,013
stumbled into super-asymmetry

164
00:03:54,054 --> 00:03:55,889
and it was really our discovery.

165
00:03:55,931 --> 00:03:58,476
Oh. No, thanks.

166
00:04:00,144 --> 00:04:02,104
You know, just because we proved

167
00:04:00,144 --> 00:04:02,104
something by accident

168
00:04:02,146 --> 00:04:03,773
doesn't mean

169
00:04:02,146 --> 00:04:03,773
we didn't prove it.

170
00:04:03,815 --> 00:04:05,191
PEMBERTON:

171
00:04:03,815 --> 00:04:05,191
Yeah, I wasn't trying

172
00:04:05,232 --> 00:04:07,026
to prove that my wife

173
00:04:05,232 --> 00:04:07,026
was cheating on me

174
00:04:07,067 --> 00:04:08,361
when I came home early

175
00:04:07,067 --> 00:04:08,361
one Friday,

176
00:04:08,402 --> 00:04:11,155
but I'm still sleeping

177
00:04:08,402 --> 00:04:11,155
on his couch.

178
00:04:11,197 --> 00:04:12,824
I told you,

179
00:04:11,197 --> 00:04:12,824
you can do better than her.

180
00:04:12,865 --> 00:04:15,201
Thanks. It just hurts.

181
00:04:15,242 --> 00:04:17,537
And when you win that

182
00:04:15,242 --> 00:04:17,537
Nobel Prize, she's gonna realize

183
00:04:17,578 --> 00:04:19,664
that she was wrong,

184
00:04:17,578 --> 00:04:19,664
you are not a fraud.

185
00:04:19,706 --> 00:04:22,542
She is not wrong.

186
00:04:22,583 --> 00:04:25,878
Wow, I can't believe

187
00:04:22,583 --> 00:04:25,878
you're siding with Linda.

188
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:27,547
Shame on you.

189
00:04:31,925 --> 00:04:33,761
Look at this. They

190
00:04:31,925 --> 00:04:33,761
posted another video.

191
00:04:33,803 --> 00:04:35,221
It's not even about science.

192
00:04:35,262 --> 00:04:36,930
They're on a

193
00:04:35,262 --> 00:04:36,930
celebrity bus tour.

194
00:04:36,972 --> 00:04:39,099
Those are fun. I-I went on one

195
00:04:39,141 --> 00:04:41,101
and saw Tom Hanks talking

196
00:04:39,141 --> 00:04:41,101
to his gardener.

197
00:04:41,143 --> 00:04:43,979
He's even nice when you plant

198
00:04:41,143 --> 00:04:43,979
the wrong color azaleas.

199
00:04:45,523 --> 00:04:47,650
Those guys are good at

200
00:04:45,523 --> 00:04:47,650
self-promoting, so what?

201
00:04:47,692 --> 00:04:49,943
No one ever won a Nobel

202
00:04:47,692 --> 00:04:49,943
for being nice.

203
00:04:49,985 --> 00:04:50,986
KOOTHRAPPALI:

204
00:04:49,985 --> 00:04:50,986
Yeah, but if they did,

205
00:04:51,028 --> 00:04:52,697
do you know who would win one?

206
00:04:52,739 --> 00:04:54,407
Are you gonna say Tom Hanks?

207
00:04:54,448 --> 00:04:57,785
He picked up a shovel

208
00:04:54,448 --> 00:04:57,785
and helped the guy replant.

209
00:04:59,328 --> 00:05:00,872
SIEBERT:

210
00:04:59,328 --> 00:05:00,872
Dr. Cooper,

211
00:05:00,913 --> 00:05:02,665
there you are. I just wanted

212
00:05:00,913 --> 00:05:02,665
to tell you not to worry

213
00:05:02,707 --> 00:05:05,125
about this Pemberton

214
00:05:02,707 --> 00:05:05,125
and Campbell publicity blitz.

215
00:05:05,167 --> 00:05:06,335
Are you worried?

216
00:05:06,377 --> 00:05:07,754
Not at all.

217
00:05:07,795 --> 00:05:10,256
Not even a little bit.

218
00:05:07,795 --> 00:05:10,256
(laughs)

219
00:05:10,297 --> 00:05:13,092
Look, i-it doesn't matter

220
00:05:13,133 --> 00:05:15,135
if they have popular support,

221
00:05:15,177 --> 00:05:17,513
we're gonna get the scientific

222
00:05:15,177 --> 00:05:17,513
community behind us.

223
00:05:17,555 --> 00:05:19,432
He's right, the Nobel Prize

224
00:05:17,555 --> 00:05:19,432
is about the work,

225
00:05:19,473 --> 00:05:22,226
and as your fellow scientists,

226
00:05:19,473 --> 00:05:22,226
we support you and Amy.

227
00:05:22,268 --> 00:05:24,437
That's great, Scooby Gang.

228
00:05:24,478 --> 00:05:26,898
Now, the university

229
00:05:24,478 --> 00:05:26,898
is gonna host

230
00:05:26,939 --> 00:05:29,275
a reception for you

231
00:05:26,939 --> 00:05:29,275
and Dr. Fowler

232
00:05:29,316 --> 00:05:32,737
where we invite as many

233
00:05:29,316 --> 00:05:32,737
academic luminaries as we can,

234
00:05:32,779 --> 00:05:35,281
uh, give them a chance to meet

235
00:05:32,779 --> 00:05:35,281
you, hear about your work.

236
00:05:35,322 --> 00:05:37,241
Uh, that's a great idea.

237
00:05:35,322 --> 00:05:37,241
Uh, yeah.

238
00:05:37,283 --> 00:05:39,243
Who needs to be likable

239
00:05:37,283 --> 00:05:39,243
when you have Nobel Laureates

240
00:05:39,285 --> 00:05:40,453
campaigning for you?

241
00:05:40,494 --> 00:05:41,621
Oh, yeah— wait a minute.

242
00:05:41,662 --> 00:05:43,372
Do you not think we're likable?

243
00:05:43,414 --> 00:05:45,374
That's what's great about you,

244
00:05:45,416 --> 00:05:48,127
you never stop asking

245
00:05:45,416 --> 00:05:48,127
the tough questions.

246
00:05:54,842 --> 00:05:56,886
(door closes)

247
00:05:56,928 --> 00:05:58,638
Hey. Kids asleep?

248
00:05:58,679 --> 00:06:01,181
Nope. I've been trying

249
00:05:58,679 --> 00:06:01,181
to get them down for hours.

250
00:06:01,223 --> 00:06:02,850
Apparently, Halley's afraid

251
00:06:01,223 --> 00:06:02,850
of the dark now

252
00:06:02,892 --> 00:06:03,975
and I can't turn on

253
00:06:02,892 --> 00:06:03,975
the night-light

254
00:06:04,017 --> 00:06:05,561
'cause it makes Michael cry.

255
00:06:05,603 --> 00:06:06,978
Why doesn't he like

256
00:06:05,603 --> 00:06:06,978
the night-light?

257
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:08,815
Jot that down, we can ask him

258
00:06:08,856 --> 00:06:11,651
as soon as he learns to speak.

259
00:06:11,692 --> 00:06:15,571
We can also find out what's

260
00:06:11,692 --> 00:06:15,571
so damn funny about birds.

261
00:06:15,613 --> 00:06:17,949
(Halley fusses)

262
00:06:17,989 --> 00:06:19,575
I'll go talk to her.

263
00:06:19,617 --> 00:06:23,412
I don't know why she's suddenly

264
00:06:19,617 --> 00:06:23,412
so afraid of everything.

265
00:06:23,454 --> 00:06:26,499
Honey, remember,

266
00:06:23,454 --> 00:06:26,499
she's my child, too.

267
00:06:30,837 --> 00:06:32,296
WOLOWITZ (over monitor):

268
00:06:30,837 --> 00:06:32,296
Hey, sweetie,

269
00:06:32,338 --> 00:06:34,340
I heard you were afraid

270
00:06:32,338 --> 00:06:34,340
of the dark.

271
00:06:34,381 --> 00:06:37,844
I know someone else

272
00:06:34,381 --> 00:06:37,844
who was afraid of the dark once.

273
00:06:37,885 --> 00:06:40,137
Your daddy,

274
00:06:37,885 --> 00:06:40,137
when he was in space.

275
00:06:40,179 --> 00:06:41,681
(Wolowitz chuckles)

276
00:06:41,722 --> 00:06:45,559
And just like you,

277
00:06:41,722 --> 00:06:45,559
I was wearing a full diaper.

278
00:06:47,018 --> 00:06:49,146
Hey, good news.

279
00:06:49,188 --> 00:06:51,858
They're inviting several Nobel

280
00:06:49,188 --> 00:06:51,858
Laureates to our reception.

281
00:06:51,899 --> 00:06:53,609
Oh, great, like who?

282
00:06:53,651 --> 00:06:55,862
Uh... Makoto Kobayashi.

283
00:06:55,903 --> 00:06:57,989
Da— ooh.

284
00:06:58,029 --> 00:07:00,157
What?

285
00:07:00,199 --> 00:07:01,826
Well, I may have been

286
00:07:00,199 --> 00:07:01,826
less than kind to him

287
00:07:01,868 --> 00:07:04,662
about his Nobel Prize win.

288
00:07:04,704 --> 00:07:05,913
Why?

289
00:07:05,955 --> 00:07:07,832
I was jealous, angry

290
00:07:05,955 --> 00:07:07,832
and new to Twitter.

291
00:07:07,874 --> 00:07:09,375
It was a dangerous combination.

292
00:07:09,416 --> 00:07:12,503
Okay, so scratch Kobayashi.

293
00:07:12,545 --> 00:07:14,547
Uh, George Smoot's on here.

294
00:07:14,588 --> 00:07:16,883
(hisses, groans)

295
00:07:16,924 --> 00:07:19,385
We have a history.

296
00:07:19,426 --> 00:07:21,888
Saul Perlmutter?

297
00:07:21,929 --> 00:07:23,305
(groans):

298
00:07:21,929 --> 00:07:23,305
Oh!

299
00:07:24,431 --> 00:07:26,642
What about Kip Thorne?

300
00:07:26,684 --> 00:07:28,394
(stammers)

301
00:07:26,684 --> 00:07:28,394
That was a misunderstanding.

302
00:07:28,435 --> 00:07:30,021
I didn't know

303
00:07:28,435 --> 00:07:30,021
he was right behind me.

304
00:07:31,772 --> 00:07:35,067
So you've alienated everyone

305
00:07:31,772 --> 00:07:35,067
we need to help us?

306
00:07:35,108 --> 00:07:37,277
Well, Amy, if I had known

307
00:07:35,108 --> 00:07:37,277
that someday we'd need them,

308
00:07:37,319 --> 00:07:40,489
I would never

309
00:07:37,319 --> 00:07:40,489
have insulted them.

310
00:07:40,531 --> 00:07:42,408
Well, that doesn't

311
00:07:40,531 --> 00:07:42,408
make it better.

312
00:07:40,531 --> 00:07:42,408
Oh.

313
00:07:42,449 --> 00:07:45,244
Well, it's also not true.

314
00:07:49,707 --> 00:07:52,626
(door opens, closes)

315
00:07:55,004 --> 00:07:57,464
Hey.

316
00:07:55,004 --> 00:07:57,464
Hey.

317
00:07:57,506 --> 00:07:59,592
Oh, that's cute.

318
00:07:59,633 --> 00:08:02,219
Did Halley draw that

319
00:07:59,633 --> 00:08:02,219
at preschool?

320
00:08:03,846 --> 00:08:05,138
I drew it.

321
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:06,348
Well, good night.

322
00:08:08,475 --> 00:08:10,728
It's supposed to be

323
00:08:08,475 --> 00:08:10,728
an astronaut.

324
00:08:10,770 --> 00:08:14,065
And I'm supposed to be

325
00:08:10,770 --> 00:08:14,065
living on my own at this age,

326
00:08:14,106 --> 00:08:17,610
but here we are.

327
00:08:17,651 --> 00:08:20,696
Halley was scared and Howard

328
00:08:17,651 --> 00:08:20,696
told her the sweetest story

329
00:08:20,738 --> 00:08:23,407
about when he was in space

330
00:08:20,738 --> 00:08:23,407
and I thought I could turn it

331
00:08:23,449 --> 00:08:25,242
into a book for her and Michael.

332
00:08:25,284 --> 00:08:27,620
Oh, well, I mean,

333
00:08:25,284 --> 00:08:27,620
I am an artist.

334
00:08:27,661 --> 00:08:30,247
Uh, i-if you want,

335
00:08:27,661 --> 00:08:30,247
I could do the drawings.

336
00:08:30,289 --> 00:08:31,999
Really? That'd be amazing.

337
00:08:30,289 --> 00:08:31,999
Yeah,

338
00:08:32,041 --> 00:08:33,918
it'd be fun. And a,

339
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:36,253
a nice change of pace

340
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:36,253
from what I usually draw.

341
00:08:36,295 --> 00:08:37,463
What do you usually draw?

342
00:08:37,504 --> 00:08:38,464
Well, good night.

343
00:08:42,927 --> 00:08:44,595
(device chimes)

344
00:08:44,637 --> 00:08:46,138
Someone texting you?

345
00:08:44,637 --> 00:08:46,138
Uh, no,

346
00:08:46,179 --> 00:08:48,099
I just met my exercise

347
00:08:46,179 --> 00:08:48,099
goal for the day.

348
00:08:52,144 --> 00:08:54,187
By doing the dishes?

349
00:08:54,229 --> 00:08:56,565
Hey, you have your goals,

350
00:08:54,229 --> 00:08:56,565
I have mine.

351
00:08:59,151 --> 00:09:00,903
Hello.

352
00:08:59,151 --> 00:09:00,903
What are you two doing?

353
00:09:00,945 --> 00:09:03,614
Mm, just finishing a workout.

354
00:09:03,656 --> 00:09:04,782
What's up?

355
00:09:04,824 --> 00:09:06,325
Do you have any cookie dough?

356
00:09:06,366 --> 00:09:09,161
Uh, I think so. Let me see.

357
00:09:09,202 --> 00:09:14,041
Yeah, we've got, uh, chocolate

358
00:09:09,202 --> 00:09:14,041
chip and oatmeal raisin.

359
00:09:14,083 --> 00:09:15,501
Oatmeal raisin?

360
00:09:15,542 --> 00:09:17,795
I know at least two things wrong

361
00:09:15,542 --> 00:09:17,795
with that cookie.

362
00:09:19,254 --> 00:09:20,965
It's for the Nobel Laureates.

363
00:09:21,007 --> 00:09:24,176
We need them on our side,

364
00:09:21,007 --> 00:09:24,176
but unfortunately, Sheldon...

365
00:09:24,217 --> 00:09:27,304
No. "Unfortunately, Sheldon..."

366
00:09:24,217 --> 00:09:27,304
that's all you got to say.

367
00:09:27,346 --> 00:09:29,473
Well, that's— so you need

368
00:09:27,346 --> 00:09:29,473
these people's support

369
00:09:29,515 --> 00:09:31,058
and you're sending

370
00:09:29,515 --> 00:09:31,058
them baked goods?

371
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:32,643
Yeah, they're pretty smart.

372
00:09:32,685 --> 00:09:34,186
Don't you think they're gonna

373
00:09:32,685 --> 00:09:34,186
realize it's just a bribe?

374
00:09:34,227 --> 00:09:36,522
No, you'd think,

375
00:09:34,227 --> 00:09:36,522
but sometimes brilliant people

376
00:09:36,563 --> 00:09:39,483
can be painfully oblivious

377
00:09:36,563 --> 00:09:39,483
to social cues.

378
00:09:42,987 --> 00:09:46,073
Thank you for pointing

379
00:09:42,987 --> 00:09:46,073
that out, Sheldon.

380
00:09:46,115 --> 00:09:47,700
Anytime.

381
00:09:53,747 --> 00:09:55,916
"Sheldon Cooper"? Hmm.

382
00:10:00,838 --> 00:10:02,048
"Sheldon Cooper"?

383
00:10:02,089 --> 00:10:04,967
(scoffs)

384
00:10:02,089 --> 00:10:04,967
Pass.

385
00:10:05,009 --> 00:10:08,721
"Sheldon Cooper." Aw.

386
00:10:08,762 --> 00:10:11,557
Ugh, oatmeal raisin?

387
00:10:11,598 --> 00:10:14,434
Ugh.

388
00:10:14,476 --> 00:10:16,228
(phone chimes)

389
00:10:16,269 --> 00:10:19,439
Oh, it's from Saul Perlmutter.

390
00:10:19,481 --> 00:10:20,524
(gasps)

391
00:10:19,481 --> 00:10:20,524
He sent me a picture.

392
00:10:20,566 --> 00:10:22,234
Ooh, let me see.

393
00:10:22,275 --> 00:10:26,238
Oh, he arranged the cookies

394
00:10:22,275 --> 00:10:26,238
to spell out "thank you."

395
00:10:27,573 --> 00:10:30,367
Sheldon, that word

396
00:10:27,573 --> 00:10:30,367
isn't "thank."

397
00:10:36,665 --> 00:10:39,793
(knock on door)

398
00:10:36,665 --> 00:10:39,793
Hi. I got you a surprise.

399
00:10:39,835 --> 00:10:42,713
What— Oh. (chuckles)

400
00:10:39,835 --> 00:10:42,713
What's the occasion?

401
00:10:42,755 --> 00:10:44,381
I heard you tell Halley

402
00:10:42,755 --> 00:10:44,381
that story the other night,

403
00:10:44,423 --> 00:10:45,966
and I thought it was

404
00:10:46,008 --> 00:10:49,136
so sweet that Stuart and I

405
00:10:46,008 --> 00:10:49,136
turned it into a book.

406
00:10:49,178 --> 00:10:53,557
The Frightened

407
00:10:49,178 --> 00:10:53,557
Little Astronaut?

408
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:58,020
That looks

409
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:58,020
just like you.

410
00:10:58,062 --> 00:11:01,941
Look how tiny

411
00:10:58,062 --> 00:11:01,941
and scared you look.

412
00:11:01,982 --> 00:11:04,068
And the best part is,

413
00:11:01,982 --> 00:11:04,068
Stuart showed it

414
00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:05,444
to a publisher

415
00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:05,444
friend of his,

416
00:11:05,485 --> 00:11:06,779
and they're interested in it.

417
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:09,907
That is so cool.

418
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:09,907
Absolutely not.

419
00:11:11,117 --> 00:11:12,492
Why?

420
00:11:12,534 --> 00:11:14,745
Because I don't want

421
00:11:12,534 --> 00:11:14,745
the whole world to know

422
00:11:14,787 --> 00:11:16,956
I was the frightened

423
00:11:14,787 --> 00:11:16,956
little astronaut!

424
00:11:20,459 --> 00:11:23,754
Maybe you should've called it

425
00:11:20,459 --> 00:11:23,754
The Bitchy Little Astronaut.

426
00:11:28,175 --> 00:11:30,677
You want to tell me

427
00:11:28,175 --> 00:11:30,677
what's going on?

428
00:11:30,719 --> 00:11:32,471
Is my distress

429
00:11:30,719 --> 00:11:32,471
that obvious?

430
00:11:32,512 --> 00:11:34,473
Sheldon, please don't

431
00:11:32,512 --> 00:11:34,473
take this the wrong way,

432
00:11:34,514 --> 00:11:36,142
but when you're quiet

433
00:11:34,514 --> 00:11:36,142
even for a second,

434
00:11:36,183 --> 00:11:38,144
something's wrong.

435
00:11:38,185 --> 00:11:40,311
Well, it's true.

436
00:11:40,353 --> 00:11:42,982
The fact is, I feel

437
00:11:40,353 --> 00:11:42,982
really bad for Amy.

438
00:11:43,023 --> 00:11:44,275
Well, we all do.

439
00:11:44,315 --> 00:11:46,986
But just for fun,

440
00:11:44,315 --> 00:11:46,986
why do you?

441
00:11:47,027 --> 00:11:49,655
Well, she didn't

442
00:11:47,027 --> 00:11:49,655
do anything wrong,

443
00:11:49,696 --> 00:11:52,825
but she's paying

444
00:11:49,696 --> 00:11:52,825
for my mistakes.

445
00:11:49,696 --> 00:11:52,825
Wow.

446
00:11:52,866 --> 00:11:54,325
What?

447
00:11:54,367 --> 00:11:57,121
No— I'm just

448
00:11:54,367 --> 00:11:57,121
honestly impressed.

449
00:11:57,163 --> 00:12:00,166
When did you start caring

450
00:11:57,163 --> 00:12:00,166
about other people's feelings?

451
00:12:00,207 --> 00:12:02,751
Well, I laughed when Amy

452
00:12:00,207 --> 00:12:02,751
got a shock from

453
00:12:02,793 --> 00:12:05,462
the broken Christmas tree

454
00:12:02,793 --> 00:12:05,462
lights, so it was after that.

455
00:12:07,881 --> 00:12:10,717
So none of them are

456
00:12:07,881 --> 00:12:10,717
coming to the reception?

457
00:12:10,759 --> 00:12:12,511
I don't think so.

458
00:12:12,552 --> 00:12:15,889
Okay, what did he say

459
00:12:12,552 --> 00:12:15,889
that was so insulting?

460
00:12:12,552 --> 00:12:15,889
(sighs) Well,

461
00:12:15,931 --> 00:12:18,017
he may have suggested there was

462
00:12:18,058 --> 00:12:22,021
an inelegance to the quadrupole

463
00:12:18,058 --> 00:12:22,021
normalization of Smoot's data.

464
00:12:22,062 --> 00:12:23,981
Damn.

465
00:12:27,193 --> 00:12:29,695
See, sometimes I wish I could

466
00:12:27,193 --> 00:12:29,695
invent a time machine,

467
00:12:29,736 --> 00:12:31,571
so I could go back

468
00:12:29,736 --> 00:12:31,571
and prevent myself

469
00:12:31,613 --> 00:12:33,199
from acting so rashly.

470
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:36,869
Or moving forward, you could

471
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:36,869
think before you speak.

472
00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:39,038
I suppose so.

473
00:12:39,079 --> 00:12:42,833
But the time machine thing

474
00:12:39,079 --> 00:12:42,833
is probably more likely.

475
00:12:42,875 --> 00:12:45,919
My problem is that

476
00:12:42,875 --> 00:12:45,919
I don't always know

477
00:12:45,961 --> 00:12:47,880
when I've gone too far.

478
00:12:47,921 --> 00:12:50,174
Well, uh, if you like,

479
00:12:47,921 --> 00:12:50,174
I could try to help you out.

480
00:12:50,216 --> 00:12:53,344
You know, and maybe let you know

481
00:12:50,216 --> 00:12:53,344
if you're crossing a line.

482
00:12:53,384 --> 00:12:56,347
Oh, you mean, like,

483
00:12:53,384 --> 00:12:56,347
with a code word?

484
00:12:53,384 --> 00:12:56,347
Sure.

485
00:12:56,387 --> 00:12:58,807
How's "shut up"?

486
00:13:00,309 --> 00:13:02,353
That's perfect. People

487
00:13:00,309 --> 00:13:02,353
say it to me all the time,

488
00:13:02,393 --> 00:13:03,478
no one will suspect.

489
00:13:07,233 --> 00:13:09,902
Hey, got a minute?

490
00:13:07,233 --> 00:13:09,902
Sure. What's up?

491
00:13:09,943 --> 00:13:12,029
Uh, Bernadette said

492
00:13:12,071 --> 00:13:13,739
you weren't crazy

493
00:13:12,071 --> 00:13:13,739
about the book.

494
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:15,032
No. (chuckles)

495
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:15,032
It's great.

496
00:13:15,074 --> 00:13:16,742
I just don't want anyone

497
00:13:15,074 --> 00:13:16,742
to ever see it

498
00:13:16,783 --> 00:13:18,409
or read it or know it exists.

499
00:13:18,451 --> 00:13:21,080
But this could be

500
00:13:18,451 --> 00:13:21,080
really good for me,

501
00:13:21,121 --> 00:13:23,540
you know? Finally get

502
00:13:21,121 --> 00:13:23,540
my artwork published.

503
00:13:23,582 --> 00:13:26,459
And-and come on,

504
00:13:23,582 --> 00:13:26,459
it's a, it's a cute story.

505
00:13:26,501 --> 00:13:27,669
Oh, easy for

506
00:13:26,501 --> 00:13:27,669
you to say.

507
00:13:27,711 --> 00:13:29,755
No one's gonna think

508
00:13:27,711 --> 00:13:29,755
you're a coward.

509
00:13:29,796 --> 00:13:31,924
Are you kidding?

510
00:13:29,796 --> 00:13:31,924
The other day

511
00:13:31,965 --> 00:13:34,760
in the comic book store,

512
00:13:31,965 --> 00:13:34,760
a balloon popped and I threw up.

513
00:13:38,097 --> 00:13:40,557
Can't you just

514
00:13:38,097 --> 00:13:40,557
take my name off it?

515
00:13:40,599 --> 00:13:43,769
No, uh, the only reason

516
00:13:40,599 --> 00:13:43,769
the publisher's interested

517
00:13:43,810 --> 00:13:45,979
is 'cause a real astronaut

518
00:13:43,810 --> 00:13:45,979
wrote it.

519
00:13:46,021 --> 00:13:49,233
Well, look, what if

520
00:13:46,021 --> 00:13:49,233
we made a few changes?

521
00:13:49,275 --> 00:13:51,110
Uh, sure, yes.

522
00:13:51,151 --> 00:13:53,444
What-what do you have in mind?

523
00:13:51,151 --> 00:13:53,444
Well, nothing major.

524
00:13:53,486 --> 00:13:54,905
But see here on the

525
00:13:53,486 --> 00:13:54,905
cover, where it says

526
00:13:54,947 --> 00:13:56,949
"frightened little,"

527
00:13:54,947 --> 00:13:56,949
what if, I don't know,

528
00:13:56,990 --> 00:13:59,952
it didn't say that?

529
00:13:59,993 --> 00:14:03,454
So, it would just be

530
00:13:59,993 --> 00:14:03,454
The Astronaut?

531
00:14:03,496 --> 00:14:05,916
Yeah, you're right.

532
00:14:03,496 --> 00:14:05,916
That doesn't quite pop.

533
00:14:05,958 --> 00:14:09,378
What about...

534
00:14:05,958 --> 00:14:09,378
The Brave Astronaut?

535
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:11,838
See, that's got

536
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:11,838
some zip to it!

537
00:14:12,965 --> 00:14:14,633
Okay.

538
00:14:14,674 --> 00:14:17,177
And here on this page,

539
00:14:14,674 --> 00:14:17,177
where I'm crying.

540
00:14:17,219 --> 00:14:19,888
What if, instead,

541
00:14:17,219 --> 00:14:19,888
I'm... punching a meteor

542
00:14:19,930 --> 00:14:23,309
into the sun with

543
00:14:19,930 --> 00:14:23,309
my bare fists?

544
00:14:23,350 --> 00:14:25,311
So you have superpowers?

545
00:14:25,352 --> 00:14:28,105
I like the way

546
00:14:25,352 --> 00:14:28,105
you're thinking.

547
00:14:30,899 --> 00:14:33,152
Professor Thorne?

548
00:14:33,193 --> 00:14:34,320
Dr. Hofstadter.

549
00:14:34,361 --> 00:14:35,988
Uh, you know

550
00:14:34,361 --> 00:14:35,988
my wife, Penny.

551
00:14:36,029 --> 00:14:37,614
Sure. Hi.

552
00:14:36,029 --> 00:14:37,614
PENNY: Hi.

553
00:14:37,656 --> 00:14:40,200
(laughs)

554
00:14:37,656 --> 00:14:40,200
Uh, we wanted to talk to you

555
00:14:37,656 --> 00:14:40,200
about Dr. Cooper.

556
00:14:40,242 --> 00:14:41,368
Now, before you say no...

557
00:14:41,410 --> 00:14:42,453
No.

558
00:14:44,537 --> 00:14:46,123
Well, then, after you say no.

559
00:14:46,165 --> 00:14:47,540
No.

560
00:14:47,582 --> 00:14:50,377
Okay, look, Sheldon's

561
00:14:47,582 --> 00:14:50,377
a pain in the ass.

562
00:14:50,419 --> 00:14:52,129
But Dr. Fowler's

563
00:14:50,419 --> 00:14:52,129
really nice.

564
00:14:52,171 --> 00:14:55,299
So if you average

565
00:14:52,171 --> 00:14:55,299
them out— math...

566
00:14:56,591 --> 00:14:57,884
you got someone

567
00:14:56,591 --> 00:14:57,884
who's okay.

568
00:14:57,926 --> 00:14:59,219
(stammers) But more

569
00:14:59,261 --> 00:15:01,638
than the person,

570
00:14:59,261 --> 00:15:01,638
the Nobel is about the work.

571
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,307
You should understand that

572
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,307
more than anyone.

573
00:15:03,349 --> 00:15:05,642
Yes, because of your work

574
00:15:03,349 --> 00:15:05,642
on gravitational waves.

575
00:15:05,684 --> 00:15:07,186
You know my work?

576
00:15:07,227 --> 00:15:09,355
I do. But I'm-I'm really

577
00:15:07,227 --> 00:15:09,355
hogging this conversation.

578
00:15:09,396 --> 00:15:11,190
Leonard?

579
00:15:09,396 --> 00:15:11,190
(clears throat)

580
00:15:11,231 --> 00:15:12,691
Just give them a chance.

581
00:15:12,732 --> 00:15:15,277
Uh, science has a history

582
00:15:12,732 --> 00:15:15,277
of difficult people.

583
00:15:15,319 --> 00:15:16,945
Look at, uh,

584
00:15:15,319 --> 00:15:16,945
Newton, who was

585
00:15:16,987 --> 00:15:19,490
a jerk to Leibniz, and Leibniz,

586
00:15:16,987 --> 00:15:19,490
who was a jerk to everyone.

587
00:15:19,531 --> 00:15:21,533
Yeah, you know, and I

588
00:15:19,531 --> 00:15:21,533
don't need to tell you

589
00:15:21,574 --> 00:15:23,535
that gravitational waves

590
00:15:21,574 --> 00:15:23,535
are disturbances

591
00:15:23,576 --> 00:15:25,371
in the curvature

592
00:15:23,576 --> 00:15:25,371
of space-time.

593
00:15:25,412 --> 00:15:28,499
Or that the— Hey, you worked

594
00:15:25,412 --> 00:15:28,499
on the movie Interstellar?

595
00:15:34,546 --> 00:15:36,173
So what do you think?

596
00:15:36,215 --> 00:15:38,050
I think if you were in space

597
00:15:38,091 --> 00:15:41,261
without a shirt on, you'd die.

598
00:15:41,303 --> 00:15:43,055
Oh.

599
00:15:43,096 --> 00:15:44,597
No, I am wearing

600
00:15:43,096 --> 00:15:44,597
a shirt.

601
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:48,435
It's just skintight,

602
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:48,435
so you can see my pecs.

603
00:15:48,477 --> 00:15:50,603
When did you get pecs?

604
00:15:50,645 --> 00:15:54,774
Yesterday, when I made

605
00:15:50,645 --> 00:15:54,774
Stuart add them.

606
00:15:54,816 --> 00:15:56,402
Howie, what I liked

607
00:15:54,816 --> 00:15:56,402
about the other story

608
00:15:56,443 --> 00:15:57,944
was that it was real.

609
00:15:57,986 --> 00:16:00,572
I mean, nothing in this

610
00:15:57,986 --> 00:16:00,572
actually happened to you.

611
00:16:00,613 --> 00:16:03,116
(chuckles):

612
00:16:00,613 --> 00:16:03,116
So, it's a children's book.

613
00:16:03,158 --> 00:16:04,868
I mean, cats

614
00:16:03,158 --> 00:16:04,868
don't wear hats.

615
00:16:04,910 --> 00:16:06,745
And if someone gives you

616
00:16:04,910 --> 00:16:06,745
green eggs, it ends

617
00:16:06,786 --> 00:16:09,248
with you on the toilet

618
00:16:06,786 --> 00:16:09,248
trying to make a deal with God.

619
00:16:11,417 --> 00:16:13,460
But the real story was so sweet.

620
00:16:13,502 --> 00:16:15,587
The little astronaut

621
00:16:13,502 --> 00:16:15,587
was afraid,

622
00:16:15,628 --> 00:16:18,090
but he still went to space,

623
00:16:15,628 --> 00:16:18,090
and that's what made him brave.

624
00:16:18,131 --> 00:16:22,219
(scoffs) But in space,

625
00:16:18,131 --> 00:16:22,219
the other astronauts...

626
00:16:22,261 --> 00:16:24,637
made fun of him,

627
00:16:22,261 --> 00:16:24,637
and that's a thing

628
00:16:24,679 --> 00:16:26,557
he doesn't want to relive.

629
00:16:26,598 --> 00:16:28,225
I get that.

630
00:16:30,352 --> 00:16:32,271
I guess it would

631
00:16:30,352 --> 00:16:32,271
just take a really

632
00:16:32,312 --> 00:16:34,440
brave man to put an embarrassing

633
00:16:32,312 --> 00:16:34,440
story like that

634
00:16:34,481 --> 00:16:36,900
out into the world,

635
00:16:34,481 --> 00:16:36,900
just so it might help

636
00:16:36,942 --> 00:16:39,278
some frightened children

637
00:16:36,942 --> 00:16:39,278
not feel so alone.

638
00:16:39,319 --> 00:16:43,115
Wow. That is

639
00:16:39,319 --> 00:16:43,115
quite the guilt trip.

640
00:16:45,451 --> 00:16:47,994
Are you sure you're not Jewish?

641
00:16:51,706 --> 00:16:54,418
I'm just a wife that is

642
00:16:51,706 --> 00:16:54,418
so proud of her husband,

643
00:16:54,460 --> 00:16:55,919
and doesn't think

644
00:16:54,460 --> 00:16:55,919
that he has anything

645
00:16:55,961 --> 00:16:58,004
to be embarrassed about.

646
00:16:55,961 --> 00:16:58,004
Oh.

647
00:16:58,046 --> 00:17:00,715
You're sounding

648
00:16:58,046 --> 00:17:00,715
less and less Jewish.

649
00:17:03,218 --> 00:17:05,387
Hey, we just heard that

650
00:17:03,218 --> 00:17:05,387
you're the ones

651
00:17:05,429 --> 00:17:07,306
who convinced

652
00:17:05,429 --> 00:17:07,306
the Nobel Laureates to come.

653
00:17:07,347 --> 00:17:08,307
Thank you.

654
00:17:07,347 --> 00:17:08,307
PENNY:

655
00:17:07,347 --> 00:17:08,307
You are welcome.

656
00:17:08,348 --> 00:17:09,308
You guys deserve this.

657
00:17:09,349 --> 00:17:10,392
Yeah, now get out of here,

658
00:17:10,434 --> 00:17:12,727
go talk to some

659
00:17:10,434 --> 00:17:12,727
smart people.

660
00:17:12,769 --> 00:17:15,772
Wait a minute.

661
00:17:12,769 --> 00:17:15,772
Yeah, sorry.

662
00:17:12,769 --> 00:17:15,772
Sometimes I forget

663
00:17:15,814 --> 00:17:18,150
you're smart because

664
00:17:15,814 --> 00:17:18,150
you're so sexy.

665
00:17:18,191 --> 00:17:21,445
I can see that.

666
00:17:18,191 --> 00:17:21,445
Yeah.

667
00:17:21,487 --> 00:17:23,113
Dr. Cooper.

668
00:17:21,487 --> 00:17:23,113
Dr. Fowler.

669
00:17:23,155 --> 00:17:25,491
I was just telling Professor

670
00:17:23,155 --> 00:17:25,491
Arnold how you came up with

671
00:17:25,532 --> 00:17:27,326
super-asymmetry

672
00:17:25,532 --> 00:17:27,326
at your wedding.

673
00:17:27,367 --> 00:17:29,328
It's a wonderful story.

674
00:17:29,369 --> 00:17:30,996
Ha, it really is.

675
00:17:31,037 --> 00:17:32,872
I wouldn't say it was the

676
00:17:31,037 --> 00:17:32,872
highlight of the wedding,

677
00:17:32,914 --> 00:17:34,500
because I've been

678
00:17:32,914 --> 00:17:34,500
told not to

679
00:17:34,541 --> 00:17:37,043
for reasons I don't

680
00:17:34,541 --> 00:17:37,043
fully understand.

681
00:17:37,085 --> 00:17:39,254
Uh, but what he does understand

682
00:17:37,085 --> 00:17:39,254
is how the universe works,

683
00:17:39,296 --> 00:17:40,713
and that's

684
00:17:39,296 --> 00:17:40,713
what's important.

685
00:17:40,755 --> 00:17:43,300
Not what comes out

686
00:17:40,755 --> 00:17:43,300
of his mouth. (laughs)

687
00:17:46,595 --> 00:17:47,887
Uh-oh.

688
00:17:47,929 --> 00:17:49,556
I haven't been to a lot of

689
00:17:47,929 --> 00:17:49,556
parties like this,

690
00:17:49,598 --> 00:17:53,602
but what does a physics

691
00:17:49,598 --> 00:17:53,602
rumble look like?

692
00:17:53,644 --> 00:17:55,728
Kind of like

693
00:17:53,644 --> 00:17:55,728
angry chickens.

694
00:17:53,644 --> 00:17:55,728
Hmm.

695
00:17:55,770 --> 00:17:59,650
Or-or-or-or like, uh,

696
00:17:55,770 --> 00:17:59,650
when-when puppets fight.

697
00:17:59,691 --> 00:18:02,611
Dr. Cooper, Dr. Fowler,

698
00:17:59,691 --> 00:18:02,611
good to see you.

699
00:18:02,653 --> 00:18:03,820
What are you doing here?

700
00:18:03,862 --> 00:18:05,280
Professor Smoot

701
00:18:03,862 --> 00:18:05,280
invited us.

702
00:18:05,322 --> 00:18:06,865
We're Facebook friends.

703
00:18:05,322 --> 00:18:06,865
Smooty!

704
00:18:09,535 --> 00:18:12,245
Well, this is our

705
00:18:09,535 --> 00:18:12,245
reception, so go away.

706
00:18:12,287 --> 00:18:13,497
SHELDON:

707
00:18:12,287 --> 00:18:13,497
Actually, Amy,

708
00:18:13,539 --> 00:18:15,165
I think we should

709
00:18:13,539 --> 00:18:15,165
let them stay.

710
00:18:15,207 --> 00:18:16,749
Please, enjoy yourselves.

711
00:18:16,791 --> 00:18:18,502
Try some pigs

712
00:18:16,791 --> 00:18:18,502
in blankets.

713
00:18:18,544 --> 00:18:20,546
And yes, that

714
00:18:18,544 --> 00:18:20,546
is the plural.

715
00:18:20,587 --> 00:18:22,172
Great.

716
00:18:20,587 --> 00:18:22,172
Thanks.

717
00:18:23,674 --> 00:18:24,883
What are you doing?

718
00:18:24,924 --> 00:18:26,426
If they stay,

719
00:18:24,924 --> 00:18:26,426
everyone will see

720
00:18:26,468 --> 00:18:27,886
that their grasp

721
00:18:26,468 --> 00:18:27,886
on super-asymmetry

722
00:18:27,927 --> 00:18:29,054
is tenuous at best.

723
00:18:29,095 --> 00:18:31,390
Oh. That's clever.

724
00:18:31,431 --> 00:18:33,850
Yeah, I don't just know

725
00:18:31,431 --> 00:18:33,850
the plurals of things, Amy.

726
00:18:35,268 --> 00:18:36,645
Is this gonna be

727
00:18:35,268 --> 00:18:36,645
a problem?

728
00:18:36,687 --> 00:18:38,855
Mm? No, no, no.

729
00:18:36,687 --> 00:18:38,855
We have a plan.

730
00:18:38,897 --> 00:18:40,357
Uh, Dr. Campbell

731
00:18:38,897 --> 00:18:40,357
and Pemberton,

732
00:18:40,399 --> 00:18:42,568
settle a bet for

733
00:18:40,399 --> 00:18:42,568
Dr. Fowler and me?

734
00:18:42,609 --> 00:18:44,861
We were just discussing,

735
00:18:42,609 --> 00:18:44,861
under what conditions

736
00:18:44,903 --> 00:18:46,988
the radiative corrections

737
00:18:44,903 --> 00:18:46,988
to super-asymmetry

738
00:18:47,030 --> 00:18:49,199
could cause time

739
00:18:47,030 --> 00:18:49,199
variation of alpha E.M.?

740
00:18:49,241 --> 00:18:53,078
AMY:

741
00:18:49,241 --> 00:18:53,078
I say active galactic nuclei

742
00:18:49,241 --> 00:18:53,078
at cosmological distances

743
00:18:53,119 --> 00:18:54,413
show a part per

744
00:18:53,119 --> 00:18:54,413
million deviation.

745
00:18:54,454 --> 00:18:56,039
Dr. Cooper says

746
00:18:56,081 --> 00:18:59,125
this has been disproven recently

747
00:18:56,081 --> 00:18:59,125
with quasar observations.

748
00:18:59,167 --> 00:19:00,252
What do you think?

749
00:19:05,465 --> 00:19:06,925
I agree with you.

750
00:19:09,469 --> 00:19:10,721
Good answer.

751
00:19:12,138 --> 00:19:13,432
Hey, uh, if we haven't

752
00:19:12,138 --> 00:19:13,432
said it before,

753
00:19:13,473 --> 00:19:16,643
we just want to say...

754
00:19:13,473 --> 00:19:16,643
thank you.

755
00:19:16,685 --> 00:19:19,145
Yeah. We couldn't have proven

756
00:19:16,685 --> 00:19:19,145
super-asymmetry without you.

757
00:19:19,187 --> 00:19:20,939
Wait-wait. You all

758
00:19:19,187 --> 00:19:20,939
heard them say it.

759
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:22,107
They didn't do anything.

760
00:19:23,609 --> 00:19:25,944
Sheldon. Shut up.

761
00:19:23,609 --> 00:19:25,944
Yeah— Well, that's rude.

762
00:19:25,985 --> 00:19:27,446
No. Shut up.

763
00:19:27,487 --> 00:19:30,240
Oh, the code

764
00:19:27,487 --> 00:19:30,240
word, thank you.

765
00:19:30,282 --> 00:19:31,824
You know, it's strange.

766
00:19:30,282 --> 00:19:31,824
A few months ago,

767
00:19:31,866 --> 00:19:33,619
nobody paid any attention to us,

768
00:19:31,866 --> 00:19:33,619
and now all of a sudden,

769
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:35,161
we're getting all

770
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:35,161
these accolades.

771
00:19:35,203 --> 00:19:36,955
Yeah, have-have any

772
00:19:35,203 --> 00:19:36,955
of you ever felt like

773
00:19:36,996 --> 00:19:38,331
maybe you didn't

774
00:19:36,996 --> 00:19:38,331
deserve it?

775
00:19:38,373 --> 00:19:40,041
Leonard, there's

776
00:19:38,373 --> 00:19:40,041
something I need to say.

777
00:19:40,083 --> 00:19:42,628
Shut up.

778
00:19:40,083 --> 00:19:42,628
Okay.

779
00:19:42,669 --> 00:19:45,297
It's crazy. We conclusively

780
00:19:42,669 --> 00:19:45,297
proved super-asymmetry,

781
00:19:45,338 --> 00:19:48,216
and yet somehow we,

782
00:19:45,338 --> 00:19:48,216
we still feel like imposters.

783
00:19:48,258 --> 00:19:49,926
There should be

784
00:19:48,258 --> 00:19:49,926
a term for that.

785
00:19:49,968 --> 00:19:52,638
Oh, for crying out loud,

786
00:19:49,968 --> 00:19:52,638
there is a term for that!

787
00:19:52,679 --> 00:19:54,431
It's called

788
00:19:52,679 --> 00:19:54,431
"imposter syndrome"

789
00:19:54,473 --> 00:19:56,141
and you don't have it!

790
00:19:56,182 --> 00:19:57,726
Because you can't have it

791
00:19:56,182 --> 00:19:57,726
if you are imposters,

792
00:19:57,768 --> 00:19:59,102
and you are!

793
00:19:59,144 --> 00:20:01,980
We're the ones

794
00:19:59,144 --> 00:20:01,980
who discovered super-asymmetry!

795
00:20:02,021 --> 00:20:04,357
So if anyone's gonna feel like

796
00:20:02,021 --> 00:20:04,357
they have imposter syndrome,

797
00:20:04,399 --> 00:20:08,153
it's us, because we're not

798
00:20:04,399 --> 00:20:08,153
imposters! They are!

799
00:20:08,194 --> 00:20:10,947
You're imposters

800
00:20:08,194 --> 00:20:10,947
and you're frauds!

801
00:20:17,036 --> 00:20:18,997
Is that what I would've

802
00:20:17,036 --> 00:20:18,997
sounded like?

803
00:20:17,036 --> 00:20:18,997
Yeah.

804
00:20:19,038 --> 00:20:20,540
Yikes!

805
00:20:24,377 --> 00:20:27,172
"Once upon a time,

806
00:20:24,377 --> 00:20:27,172
there was a little astronaut

807
00:20:27,213 --> 00:20:30,008
who was sitting in a rocket

808
00:20:27,213 --> 00:20:30,008
waiting to go to space."

809
00:20:30,049 --> 00:20:31,593
MAN (over radio):

810
00:20:30,049 --> 00:20:31,593
Three... two... one...

811
00:20:31,635 --> 00:20:33,637
WOLOWITZ: And while all

812
00:20:31,635 --> 00:20:33,637
the other astronauts

813
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:36,348
laughed and joked,

814
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:36,348
he stayed quiet,

815
00:20:36,389 --> 00:20:37,974
because he had a secret.

816
00:20:38,016 --> 00:20:41,478
He was scared.

817
00:20:38,016 --> 00:20:41,478
He had another secret, too.

818
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:45,190
He was only pretending to be

819
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:45,190
scared to trick the alien king.

820
00:20:45,231 --> 00:20:47,108
Ha-ha!

821
00:20:48,234 --> 00:20:49,152
BERNADETTE:

822
00:20:48,234 --> 00:20:49,152
Howie.

823
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:51,822
Fine.

824
00:20:51,863 --> 00:20:53,824
There was no alien.

825
00:20:51,863 --> 00:20:53,824
(chuckles)

826
00:20:55,492 --> 00:20:58,787
There was a bossy wife, though.

827
00:20:55,492 --> 00:20:58,787
We'll get to her later.
