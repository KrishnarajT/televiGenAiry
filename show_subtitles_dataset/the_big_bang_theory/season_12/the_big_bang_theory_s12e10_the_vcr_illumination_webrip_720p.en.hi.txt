00:00:08,980 --> 00:00:10,773
Previously on

2
00:00:08,980 --> 00:00:10,773
The Big Bang Theory...

3
00:00:10,815 --> 00:00:12,442
Actually, I-I need to talk to

4
00:00:10,815 --> 00:00:12,442
both of you about your paper.

5
00:00:12,484 --> 00:00:15,195
Oh, right, how are

6
00:00:12,484 --> 00:00:15,195
the citations coming?

7
00:00:12,484 --> 00:00:15,195
Um...

8
00:00:15,236 --> 00:00:18,739
We came a-across

9
00:00:15,236 --> 00:00:18,739
a-a Russian paper

10
00:00:18,781 --> 00:00:21,159
that seems to disprove

11
00:00:18,781 --> 00:00:21,159
super-asymmetry.

12
00:00:25,497 --> 00:00:27,081
(screams)

13
00:00:29,625 --> 00:00:32,003
Okay, Sheldon and Amy

14
00:00:29,625 --> 00:00:32,003
are still pretty upset

15
00:00:32,045 --> 00:00:33,671
about their theory

16
00:00:32,045 --> 00:00:33,671
being disproved.

17
00:00:33,713 --> 00:00:36,341
So we have made

18
00:00:33,713 --> 00:00:36,341
a list of subjects

19
00:00:36,383 --> 00:00:37,633
for everyone

20
00:00:36,383 --> 00:00:37,633
to avoid.

21
00:00:37,675 --> 00:00:39,302
Symmetry.

22
00:00:37,675 --> 00:00:39,302
Asymmetry.

23
00:00:39,344 --> 00:00:40,553
Uh, SimCity—

24
00:00:40,594 --> 00:00:42,055
sounds too much like symmetry.

25
00:00:42,096 --> 00:00:43,931
LEONARD:

26
00:00:42,096 --> 00:00:43,931
That also applies

27
00:00:43,973 --> 00:00:45,933
to The Simpsons,

28
00:00:43,973 --> 00:00:45,933
Simba from The Lion King,

29
00:00:45,975 --> 00:00:47,185
and cymbals.

30
00:00:47,227 --> 00:00:50,146
Russia or Russian

31
00:00:47,227 --> 00:00:50,146
in any context.

32
00:00:50,188 --> 00:00:52,564
The country, the dressing,

33
00:00:50,188 --> 00:00:52,564
the roulette.

34
00:00:53,816 --> 00:00:56,236
Uh, also no talk of Rocky IV.

35
00:00:56,277 --> 00:00:57,904
Why Rocky IV?

36
00:00:57,945 --> 00:00:59,239
Because he fights

37
00:00:57,945 --> 00:00:59,239
a Russian.

38
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,909
I'm sorry about her.

39
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,909
(chuckles)

40
00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:04,994
We should just try and avoid

41
00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:04,994
anything that makes them think

42
00:01:05,036 --> 00:01:06,871
of their project

43
00:01:05,036 --> 00:01:06,871
or science

44
00:01:06,913 --> 00:01:09,790
or Nobel Prizes

45
00:01:06,913 --> 00:01:09,790
or successes or failures.

46
00:01:09,832 --> 00:01:12,126
Hi.

47
00:01:09,832 --> 00:01:12,126
ALL: Hi!

48
00:01:12,168 --> 00:01:13,836
Hey, guys.

49
00:01:12,168 --> 00:01:13,836
Hey-a!

50
00:01:13,878 --> 00:01:15,255
What are you guys doing?

51
00:01:16,130 --> 00:01:17,340
Nothing.

52
00:01:17,382 --> 00:01:18,716
Nothing?

53
00:01:18,758 --> 00:01:22,595
Like what my career

54
00:01:18,758 --> 00:01:22,595
has come to? Thanks a lot.

55
00:01:25,014 --> 00:01:26,766

What are you doing?

72
00:02:07,181 --> 00:02:08,682
Eating, reading,

73
00:02:08,724 --> 00:02:09,976
watching television,

74
00:02:08,724 --> 00:02:09,976
listening to the radio.

75
00:02:10,017 --> 00:02:11,644
What does it look

76
00:02:10,017 --> 00:02:11,644
like I'm doing?

77
00:02:13,521 --> 00:02:16,065
Is that asparagus? I thought

78
00:02:13,521 --> 00:02:16,065
you hate asparagus.

79
00:02:16,107 --> 00:02:18,276
I thought so, too, but I also

80
00:02:16,107 --> 00:02:18,276
thought super-asymmetry

81
00:02:18,318 --> 00:02:20,487
was a good idea,

82
00:02:18,318 --> 00:02:20,487
so what else am I wrong about?

83
00:02:20,528 --> 00:02:23,739
Oh, so now you're

84
00:02:20,528 --> 00:02:23,739
reevaluating

85
00:02:23,781 --> 00:02:25,533
every opinion you've ever had?

86
00:02:25,575 --> 00:02:27,701
Yes. I am following the example

87
00:02:27,743 --> 00:02:29,829
of 17th century philosopher

88
00:02:27,743 --> 00:02:29,829
René Descartes.

89
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:31,539
He subjected

90
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:31,539
all his beliefs

91
00:02:31,581 --> 00:02:34,083
to radical doubt so that he

92
00:02:31,581 --> 00:02:34,083
could build a bedrock belief

93
00:02:34,125 --> 00:02:37,545
and build his cognitive life

94
00:02:34,125 --> 00:02:37,545
back up on firm principles.

95
00:02:37,587 --> 00:02:39,964
Ugh! Still yucky, still yucky.

96
00:02:41,715 --> 00:02:43,259
(music stops)

97
00:02:43,301 --> 00:02:45,761
Sheldon, I know you're upset

98
00:02:43,301 --> 00:02:45,761
about the paper, okay.

99
00:02:45,803 --> 00:02:47,054
I'm upset, too.

100
00:02:47,096 --> 00:02:48,973
I mean, I was so sure

101
00:02:47,096 --> 00:02:48,973
we were right.

102
00:02:49,015 --> 00:02:51,309
Every fiber of my being

103
00:02:49,015 --> 00:02:51,309
felt like this was it.

104
00:02:51,351 --> 00:02:54,270
This was the one. How can I

105
00:02:51,351 --> 00:02:54,270
trust my instincts anymore?

106
00:02:54,312 --> 00:02:56,022
Well, just because

107
00:02:54,312 --> 00:02:56,022
our theory was wrong,

108
00:02:56,063 --> 00:02:58,191
that doesn't mean you're wrong

109
00:02:56,063 --> 00:02:58,191
about everything.

110
00:02:58,232 --> 00:03:01,319
Doesn't it? I've always thought

111
00:02:58,232 --> 00:03:01,319
I hated jazz, maybe I was wrong.

112
00:03:01,361 --> 00:03:03,530
Maybe it's great to hear

113
00:03:01,361 --> 00:03:03,530
all the notes at once.

114
00:03:03,571 --> 00:03:05,615
(music playing)

115
00:03:07,992 --> 00:03:11,078
I'm trying,

116
00:03:07,992 --> 00:03:11,078
I'm really trying!

117
00:03:14,457 --> 00:03:16,792
What you eating?

118
00:03:14,457 --> 00:03:16,792
Chicken fried steak.

119
00:03:16,834 --> 00:03:19,295
What? You can't have

120
00:03:16,834 --> 00:03:19,295
chicken fried steak

121
00:03:19,337 --> 00:03:21,047
first thing in the morning.

122
00:03:19,337 --> 00:03:21,047
Hey,

123
00:03:21,088 --> 00:03:23,966
you knew I was a bad boy

124
00:03:21,088 --> 00:03:23,966
when you married me.

125
00:03:24,008 --> 00:03:26,678
Come on, you want

126
00:03:24,008 --> 00:03:26,678
a piece of this?

127
00:03:26,718 --> 00:03:29,138
You or the steak?

128
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:30,806
Me.

129
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:30,806
I'm not sharing the steak.

130
00:03:30,848 --> 00:03:32,058
(knocking)

131
00:03:32,099 --> 00:03:34,268
Hey, you guys busy?

132
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:35,645
No, what's going on?

133
00:03:35,687 --> 00:03:38,439
I'm really worried

134
00:03:35,687 --> 00:03:38,439
about Sheldon.

135
00:03:38,481 --> 00:03:40,149
I've never seen him this down.

136
00:03:40,191 --> 00:03:42,151
Have you tried making him

137
00:03:40,191 --> 00:03:42,151
a cup of tea?

138
00:03:42,193 --> 00:03:45,446
He's reevaluated tea.

139
00:03:46,822 --> 00:03:49,617
Now he thinks it's nothing

140
00:03:46,822 --> 00:03:49,617
but leaf soup.

141
00:03:49,659 --> 00:03:51,327
That's a good point.

142
00:03:51,369 --> 00:03:53,413
No, it's not.

143
00:03:51,369 --> 00:03:53,413
No, it's not.

144
00:03:53,454 --> 00:03:55,373
He's rethinking everything.

145
00:03:55,415 --> 00:03:57,584
How long is it gonna be

146
00:03:55,415 --> 00:03:57,584
before he gets to me?

147
00:03:57,625 --> 00:03:59,960
Oh.

148
00:03:57,625 --> 00:03:59,960
It's that bad, huh?

149
00:04:00,002 --> 00:04:02,672
I'm afraid so. I just...

150
00:04:00,002 --> 00:04:02,672
I don't know what to do.

151
00:04:02,714 --> 00:04:05,508
I have something

152
00:04:02,714 --> 00:04:05,508
that might help.

153
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:08,595
It's-it's a recording

154
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:08,595
of the only person

155
00:04:08,636 --> 00:04:11,805
whose opinion Sheldon

156
00:04:08,636 --> 00:04:11,805
actually respects.

157
00:04:11,847 --> 00:04:13,057
Hawking?

158
00:04:13,099 --> 00:04:14,267
Feynman?

159
00:04:14,308 --> 00:04:16,269
No, himself.

160
00:04:17,770 --> 00:04:19,980
It's a pep talk he made

161
00:04:17,770 --> 00:04:19,980
when he was a kid.

162
00:04:20,022 --> 00:04:22,816
He gave it to me years ago

163
00:04:20,022 --> 00:04:22,816
and told me to save it

164
00:04:22,858 --> 00:04:24,360
for a real emergency.

165
00:04:24,402 --> 00:04:26,112
What?

166
00:04:24,402 --> 00:04:26,112
You didn't break it out

167
00:04:26,153 --> 00:04:28,155
when he declared his room

168
00:04:26,153 --> 00:04:28,155
a sovereign nation

169
00:04:28,197 --> 00:04:31,033
and waged a trade war

170
00:04:28,197 --> 00:04:31,033
against us?

171
00:04:31,075 --> 00:04:35,037
His major export is talking.

172
00:04:31,075 --> 00:04:35,037
I didn't want that anyway.

173
00:04:40,042 --> 00:04:41,419
Is that a VCR?

174
00:04:41,461 --> 00:04:43,879
Yeah, Amy asked if we

175
00:04:41,461 --> 00:04:43,879
had one she could borrow

176
00:04:43,921 --> 00:04:45,757
and I just want to make sure

177
00:04:43,921 --> 00:04:45,757
it still works.

178
00:04:45,798 --> 00:04:47,675
What's on the tape?

179
00:04:47,717 --> 00:04:50,595
Not sure. I used to record

180
00:04:47,717 --> 00:04:50,595
a lot of Jeopardy! for my mom,

181
00:04:50,637 --> 00:04:52,388
but if I push play

182
00:04:50,637 --> 00:04:52,388
and you see some naked people...

183
00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:54,932
Got it.

184
00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:54,932
What is porn?

185
00:04:54,974 --> 00:04:57,685
Ooh, we were looking

186
00:04:54,974 --> 00:04:57,685
for "vintage '80s erotica,"

187
00:04:57,727 --> 00:04:59,103
but I'll accept it.

188
00:04:59,145 --> 00:05:01,314
WOLOWITZ:

189
00:04:59,145 --> 00:05:01,314
Hello, everybody.

190
00:05:03,733 --> 00:05:07,111
I am The Great Howdini.

191
00:05:07,153 --> 00:05:10,323
(coughing)

192
00:05:10,364 --> 00:05:13,534
Put it back on.

193
00:05:10,364 --> 00:05:13,534
You look adorable.

194
00:05:13,576 --> 00:05:15,369
It's just a practice tape

195
00:05:15,411 --> 00:05:18,539
from when I was trying to become

196
00:05:15,411 --> 00:05:18,539
a member of the Magic Castle.

197
00:05:18,581 --> 00:05:20,416
I didn't know

198
00:05:18,581 --> 00:05:20,416
you auditioned there.

199
00:05:20,458 --> 00:05:22,168
Oh, I never went

200
00:05:20,458 --> 00:05:22,168
through with it.

201
00:05:22,209 --> 00:05:24,837
I watched the tape and realized

202
00:05:22,209 --> 00:05:24,837
I wasn't good enough.

203
00:05:24,878 --> 00:05:28,048
You know that trick where

204
00:05:24,878 --> 00:05:28,048
you saw a mannequin in half?

205
00:05:28,090 --> 00:05:30,884
Don't you mean a lady?

206
00:05:28,090 --> 00:05:30,884
Thank God it was not a lady.

207
00:05:30,926 --> 00:05:32,970
I'd just be getting

208
00:05:30,926 --> 00:05:32,970
out of jail.

209
00:05:34,054 --> 00:05:36,766
Come on, you're

210
00:05:34,054 --> 00:05:36,766
a good magician.

211
00:05:36,808 --> 00:05:40,019
Really? You always

212
00:05:36,808 --> 00:05:40,019
called magic dumb.

213
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:41,979
You can be good

214
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:41,979
at something dumb.

215
00:05:43,564 --> 00:05:45,650
You know what, you should

216
00:05:43,564 --> 00:05:45,650
audition now.

217
00:05:43,564 --> 00:05:45,650
It's fine.

218
00:05:45,692 --> 00:05:49,320
I don't need to be a member of

219
00:05:45,692 --> 00:05:49,320
the most elite magical society

220
00:05:49,362 --> 00:05:52,239
on the face

221
00:05:49,362 --> 00:05:52,239
of the earth.

222
00:05:52,281 --> 00:05:54,116
Sounds like you still want it.

223
00:05:54,158 --> 00:05:55,951
And I don't want our kids

224
00:05:55,993 --> 00:05:58,371
to watch this tape one day and

225
00:05:55,993 --> 00:05:58,371
think their dad is a quitter.

226
00:05:58,412 --> 00:06:00,665
Oh, we don't have to

227
00:05:58,412 --> 00:06:00,665
show it to them.

228
00:06:00,707 --> 00:06:03,167
Oh, I'm definitely

229
00:06:00,707 --> 00:06:03,167
showing it to them.

230
00:06:05,628 --> 00:06:07,421
Hey.

231
00:06:07,463 --> 00:06:08,880
Hello.

232
00:06:10,633 --> 00:06:12,385
"Fine with flags"?

233
00:06:14,637 --> 00:06:16,681
Yes, flags—

234
00:06:16,723 --> 00:06:19,099
up there flapping around

235
00:06:16,723 --> 00:06:19,099
on poles.

236
00:06:19,141 --> 00:06:21,101
If you think about it,

237
00:06:19,141 --> 00:06:21,101
they're just the strippers

238
00:06:21,143 --> 00:06:23,270
of the emblem world.

239
00:06:23,312 --> 00:06:25,565
Well, I got something

240
00:06:25,606 --> 00:06:27,817
that I think

241
00:06:25,606 --> 00:06:27,817
might cheer you up.

242
00:06:27,859 --> 00:06:31,111
It is the emergency pep talk

243
00:06:27,859 --> 00:06:31,111
you made when you were a kid.

244
00:06:31,153 --> 00:06:33,781
Oh, that.

245
00:06:33,823 --> 00:06:37,368
I was saving it for the day they

246
00:06:33,823 --> 00:06:37,368
stop making Star Wars movies.

247
00:06:38,745 --> 00:06:41,247
I don't think that's

248
00:06:38,745 --> 00:06:41,247
ever gonna happen.

249
00:06:41,288 --> 00:06:45,125
How long has it been

250
00:06:41,288 --> 00:06:45,125
since you've seen it?

251
00:06:45,167 --> 00:06:46,960
Not since the day I recorded it.

252
00:06:47,002 --> 00:06:49,129
No, I had just watched

253
00:06:47,002 --> 00:06:49,129
Back to the Future II,

254
00:06:49,171 --> 00:06:51,923
where Marty McFly gets a glimpse

255
00:06:49,171 --> 00:06:51,923
of his future self

256
00:06:51,965 --> 00:06:53,300
and that got me thinking,

257
00:06:53,342 --> 00:06:56,011
the day may come

258
00:06:53,342 --> 00:06:56,011
where I needed my help,

259
00:06:56,053 --> 00:06:59,139
like they did with that movie.

260
00:06:56,053 --> 00:06:59,139
That was not great.

261
00:06:59,181 --> 00:07:02,602
Okay, all hooked up.

262
00:07:02,643 --> 00:07:05,187
Here we go.

263
00:07:08,023 --> 00:07:10,276
Oh, look how cute you were.

264
00:07:10,317 --> 00:07:13,987
Amy please, of course I was

265
00:07:10,317 --> 00:07:13,987
cute. Look how I turned out.

266
00:07:14,029 --> 00:07:15,656
Hello, Sheldon.

267
00:07:15,698 --> 00:07:17,366
Hello, Sheldon.

268
00:07:17,408 --> 00:07:18,618
If you're watching this,

269
00:07:18,659 --> 00:07:21,245
I assume something bad

270
00:07:18,659 --> 00:07:21,245
has happened.

271
00:07:21,287 --> 00:07:22,914
Something unfortunate

272
00:07:21,287 --> 00:07:22,914
and unforeseen.

273
00:07:22,955 --> 00:07:26,375
Something that's making you

274
00:07:26,417 --> 00:07:27,960
question everything.

275
00:07:28,001 --> 00:07:31,213
I'm so smart.

276
00:07:31,255 --> 00:07:33,591
Now just to make sure

277
00:07:31,255 --> 00:07:33,591
it's really you watching this

278
00:07:33,633 --> 00:07:37,219
and not an imposter,

279
00:07:33,633 --> 00:07:37,219
what am I thinking of?

280
00:07:37,261 --> 00:07:38,888
On the count of three.

281
00:07:38,930 --> 00:07:41,641
One, two, three.

282
00:07:41,682 --> 00:07:45,018
Robot monkey butler.

283
00:07:41,682 --> 00:07:45,018
Robot monkey butler.

284
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:46,854
Okay, good.

285
00:07:46,896 --> 00:07:50,190
Should I leave

286
00:07:46,896 --> 00:07:50,190
you two alone?

287
00:07:50,232 --> 00:07:53,694
No, this is gonna be inspiring.

288
00:07:50,232 --> 00:07:53,694
You should watch.

289
00:07:53,736 --> 00:07:56,489
Sheldon, never forget,

290
00:07:56,530 --> 00:07:58,699
no matter how bad things seem,

291
00:07:58,741 --> 00:08:00,117
you can al...

292
00:08:03,203 --> 00:08:06,332
What? What...

293
00:08:03,203 --> 00:08:06,332
No. N... (scoffs)

294
00:08:06,373 --> 00:08:07,875
My dad taped over it

295
00:08:07,917 --> 00:08:10,336
with one of his stupid

296
00:08:07,917 --> 00:08:10,336
high school football games.

297
00:08:10,377 --> 00:08:11,796
Sorry.

298
00:08:11,838 --> 00:08:13,464
You know, it doesn't matter,

299
00:08:11,838 --> 00:08:13,464
nothing matters.

300
00:08:13,506 --> 00:08:15,174
Is there anything

301
00:08:13,506 --> 00:08:15,174
I can do?

302
00:08:15,215 --> 00:08:17,259
Yes. You can build me

303
00:08:15,215 --> 00:08:17,259
a time machine

304
00:08:17,301 --> 00:08:20,012
so I can go back and tell my

305
00:08:17,301 --> 00:08:20,012
younger self to give up, because

306
00:08:20,053 --> 00:08:21,931
nothing's gonna work out

307
00:08:20,053 --> 00:08:21,931
the way he wants.

308
00:08:25,768 --> 00:08:27,937
I was thinking a nice cup

309
00:08:25,768 --> 00:08:27,937
of leaf soup.

310
00:08:34,234 --> 00:08:36,737
What's all this?

311
00:08:36,779 --> 00:08:38,781
Your magic tricks

312
00:08:36,779 --> 00:08:38,781
from the garage.

313
00:08:38,823 --> 00:08:42,618
Your wands, your top hat

314
00:08:38,823 --> 00:08:42,618
with the stuffed mouse inside.

315
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:44,411
I never had a stuffed mouse.

316
00:08:44,453 --> 00:08:46,747
Okay, do not wear this hat.

317
00:08:46,789 --> 00:08:50,167
Why is it all

318
00:08:46,789 --> 00:08:50,167
in the living room?

319
00:08:50,209 --> 00:08:52,044
Because I think

320
00:08:50,209 --> 00:08:52,044
The Great Howdini

321
00:08:52,085 --> 00:08:54,213
deserves to be a member

322
00:08:52,085 --> 00:08:54,213
of the Magic Castle.

323
00:08:54,254 --> 00:08:57,758
That's sweet, but I'm

324
00:08:54,254 --> 00:08:57,758
not that guy anymore.

325
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,927
I've outgrown it.

326
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:03,597
Have you?

327
00:09:05,057 --> 00:09:08,143
Look, I know you still

328
00:09:05,057 --> 00:09:08,143
want this, and I can help you.

329
00:09:08,185 --> 00:09:10,021
All those pageants

330
00:09:08,185 --> 00:09:10,021
I did as a kid—

331
00:09:10,062 --> 00:09:12,023
I could teach you

332
00:09:10,062 --> 00:09:12,023
how to present yourself,

333
00:09:12,064 --> 00:09:14,441
connect with the judges,

334
00:09:12,064 --> 00:09:14,441
sabotage the competition.

335
00:09:14,483 --> 00:09:16,861
Whoa, whoa, no one's

336
00:09:14,483 --> 00:09:16,861
sabotaging anybody.

337
00:09:16,903 --> 00:09:18,195
Of course not.

338
00:09:18,237 --> 00:09:21,782
Little girls in ball gowns

339
00:09:18,237 --> 00:09:21,782
trip, it happens.

340
00:09:21,824 --> 00:09:25,244
Trust me, I'm gonna be

341
00:09:21,824 --> 00:09:25,244
the pageant mom to you

342
00:09:25,285 --> 00:09:26,787
that my mom was to me.

343
00:09:26,829 --> 00:09:29,289
I thought you hated your mom

344
00:09:26,829 --> 00:09:29,289
for making you do that.

345
00:09:29,331 --> 00:09:32,209
More talk like that and

346
00:09:29,331 --> 00:09:32,209
you're not getting any dinner.

347
00:09:32,251 --> 00:09:34,962
Amazing how it all comes back.

348
00:09:37,464 --> 00:09:39,508
(Skype ringing)

349
00:09:41,427 --> 00:09:42,678
Yes?

350
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:45,222
Hello, Mother.

351
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:45,222
Hey, Beverly.

352
00:09:45,264 --> 00:09:46,974
Hello, Leonard.

353
00:09:45,264 --> 00:09:46,974
Hello, Penny.

354
00:09:47,016 --> 00:09:49,018
To what do I owe this call?

355
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:50,352
I need your

356
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:50,352
professional advice.

357
00:09:50,394 --> 00:09:52,104
Well, I'd love

358
00:09:50,394 --> 00:09:52,104
to help you out, dear,

359
00:09:52,145 --> 00:09:53,981
but I'm very busy at the moment.

360
00:09:54,023 --> 00:09:56,149
Perhaps we can schedule

361
00:09:54,023 --> 00:09:56,149
a time next week.

362
00:09:56,191 --> 00:09:57,443
It's about Sheldon.

363
00:09:57,484 --> 00:09:58,986
Oh, well, I-I suppose

364
00:09:59,028 --> 00:10:00,821
I can spare a minute or two.

365
00:10:00,863 --> 00:10:03,449
Wh-Why did you just say

366
00:10:00,863 --> 00:10:03,449
you're too busy, but...

367
00:10:03,490 --> 00:10:06,786
Leonard, please,

368
00:10:03,490 --> 00:10:06,786
not everything is about you.

369
00:10:08,913 --> 00:10:10,205
Penny, go on.

370
00:10:10,247 --> 00:10:12,583
Well, ever since his

371
00:10:10,247 --> 00:10:12,583
paper got disproven,

372
00:10:12,625 --> 00:10:13,918
he's been a wreck.

373
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:16,587
He's been sad

374
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:16,587
and... and angry.

375
00:10:16,629 --> 00:10:18,714
He just seems

376
00:10:16,629 --> 00:10:18,714
kind of broken.

377
00:10:18,756 --> 00:10:20,215
Well, it sounds

378
00:10:18,756 --> 00:10:20,215
like he may be grieving.

379
00:10:20,257 --> 00:10:21,341
Really?

380
00:10:21,383 --> 00:10:23,094
Over a theory?

381
00:10:21,383 --> 00:10:23,094
Of course.

382
00:10:23,135 --> 00:10:25,220
You can grieve

383
00:10:23,135 --> 00:10:25,220
over any emotional loss.

384
00:10:25,262 --> 00:10:26,806
The more you care

385
00:10:25,262 --> 00:10:26,806
about something,

386
00:10:26,847 --> 00:10:29,058
the greater the trauma

387
00:10:26,847 --> 00:10:29,058
of losing it.

388
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:31,060
Oh, boy.

389
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:31,060
He cared about this a lot.

390
00:10:31,102 --> 00:10:33,228
Yeah. What can we do

391
00:10:31,102 --> 00:10:33,228
to help him?

392
00:10:33,270 --> 00:10:35,314
Well, grieving is a process.

393
00:10:35,355 --> 00:10:38,442
Every culture has its own

394
00:10:35,355 --> 00:10:38,442
rituals and traditions

395
00:10:38,484 --> 00:10:40,360
to facilitate mourning.

396
00:10:40,402 --> 00:10:43,363
The ancient Egyptians

397
00:10:40,402 --> 00:10:43,363
had their mummification,

398
00:10:43,405 --> 00:10:46,325
the Tibetans had

399
00:10:43,405 --> 00:10:46,325
their sky funerals...

400
00:10:46,366 --> 00:10:48,535
And when I was little and my dog

401
00:10:46,366 --> 00:10:48,535
died, my mom sat me down

402
00:10:48,577 --> 00:10:50,913
and very gently told me

403
00:10:48,577 --> 00:10:50,913
that she wished the truck

404
00:10:50,955 --> 00:10:53,206
had hit my dad instead.

405
00:10:55,001 --> 00:10:56,919
I was trying

406
00:10:55,001 --> 00:10:56,919
to lighten the mood.

407
00:10:56,961 --> 00:10:59,421
Your dog had just died.

408
00:11:02,466 --> 00:11:05,594
Howard and I have been working

409
00:11:02,466 --> 00:11:05,594
really hard on his audition,

410
00:11:05,636 --> 00:11:07,763
so it'll be helpful to get

411
00:11:05,636 --> 00:11:07,763
another set of eyes on it.

412
00:11:07,805 --> 00:11:09,598
Well, as someone who has

413
00:11:07,805 --> 00:11:09,598
watched every episode

414
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:10,850
of America's Got Talent,

415
00:11:10,891 --> 00:11:12,267
I'm getting pretty good

416
00:11:10,891 --> 00:11:12,267
at telling

417
00:11:12,309 --> 00:11:14,311
when some American's got talent.

418
00:11:14,353 --> 00:11:15,855
Seriously,

419
00:11:15,896 --> 00:11:18,315
Heidi and I agree,

420
00:11:15,896 --> 00:11:18,315
like, 90% of the time.

421
00:11:18,357 --> 00:11:19,900
All right.

422
00:11:19,942 --> 00:11:22,444
Don't be afraid to be

423
00:11:19,942 --> 00:11:22,444
brutally honest.

424
00:11:22,486 --> 00:11:24,864
Like my mom used to say

425
00:11:22,486 --> 00:11:24,864
when I was doing pageants,

426
00:11:24,905 --> 00:11:27,950
"Tears only make your eyes

427
00:11:24,905 --> 00:11:27,950
sparkle brighter."

428
00:11:27,992 --> 00:11:30,201
That is both sad and true.

429
00:11:30,243 --> 00:11:32,788
Half my Instagram

430
00:11:30,243 --> 00:11:32,788
is after a good cry.

431
00:11:32,830 --> 00:11:35,082
Howie, you ready?

432
00:11:35,124 --> 00:11:36,834
WOLOWITZ (flat):

433
00:11:35,124 --> 00:11:36,834
Yeah.

434
00:11:36,876 --> 00:11:41,212
I now present The Great Howdini.

435
00:11:41,254 --> 00:11:42,965

Hello. I'm The Great Howdini

447
00:12:17,457 --> 00:12:21,879
from Altadena, California.

448
00:12:21,921 --> 00:12:23,756
I have no brothers or sisters

449
00:12:23,797 --> 00:12:28,552
and my favorite thing to eat

450
00:12:23,797 --> 00:12:28,552
is grilled cheese.

451
00:12:28,594 --> 00:12:30,012
When does the magic start?

452
00:12:30,054 --> 00:12:33,599
It already started.

453
00:12:34,934 --> 00:12:36,602
Hey.

454
00:12:36,643 --> 00:12:38,854
Hi. How are

455
00:12:36,643 --> 00:12:38,854
you guys doing?

456
00:12:38,896 --> 00:12:40,647
A little better,

457
00:12:38,896 --> 00:12:40,647
if you can believe it.

458
00:12:47,278 --> 00:12:48,405
Sheldon?

459
00:12:48,447 --> 00:12:50,657
(muffled):

460
00:12:48,447 --> 00:12:50,657
Go away.

461
00:12:50,699 --> 00:12:52,659
Buddy, come on, let us help you.

462
00:12:52,701 --> 00:12:54,703
The only person

463
00:12:52,701 --> 00:12:54,703
who could help me was erased

464
00:12:54,745 --> 00:12:56,747
by the Medford High Wolves.

465
00:12:56,789 --> 00:12:59,458
Oh, that's funny. My high

466
00:12:56,789 --> 00:12:59,458
school was also the wolves.

467
00:12:59,499 --> 00:13:01,835
No? Not now? Okay.

468
00:13:01,877 --> 00:13:03,921
LEONARD: Look,

469
00:13:01,877 --> 00:13:03,921
t-this might

470
00:13:03,963 --> 00:13:05,756
seem strange, but, uh,

471
00:13:05,798 --> 00:13:08,217
we thought it might help you get

472
00:13:05,798 --> 00:13:08,217
some closure if you had a chance

473
00:13:08,259 --> 00:13:10,052
to properly say good-bye

474
00:13:08,259 --> 00:13:10,052
to your paper.

475
00:13:10,094 --> 00:13:11,720
Yeah, you know, we

476
00:13:10,094 --> 00:13:11,720
could say a few words,

477
00:13:11,762 --> 00:13:13,180
you could talk about

478
00:13:11,762 --> 00:13:13,180
what it meant to you

479
00:13:13,222 --> 00:13:15,266
and-and we could

480
00:13:13,222 --> 00:13:15,266
bury it somewhere.

481
00:13:15,306 --> 00:13:17,643
You mean have a funeral

482
00:13:15,306 --> 00:13:17,643
for our theory?

483
00:13:17,684 --> 00:13:18,852
Yeah.

484
00:13:18,894 --> 00:13:20,437
That's ridiculous.

485
00:13:20,479 --> 00:13:22,689
I thought so, too, but my mom

486
00:13:20,479 --> 00:13:22,689
thought it might work.

487
00:13:22,731 --> 00:13:25,609
Beverly thought it would help?

488
00:13:22,731 --> 00:13:25,609
We should try it.

489
00:13:25,651 --> 00:13:28,070
Wha— How come when you thought

490
00:13:25,651 --> 00:13:28,070
it was my idea...

491
00:13:28,112 --> 00:13:29,404
SHELDON:

492
00:13:28,112 --> 00:13:29,404
(stammers) Leonard,

493
00:13:29,446 --> 00:13:31,322
please, this is not about you.

494
00:13:33,284 --> 00:13:35,368
I guess we could bury it

495
00:13:33,284 --> 00:13:35,368
in the park.

496
00:13:35,410 --> 00:13:37,370
Yeah, where dogs do their

497
00:13:35,410 --> 00:13:37,370
business and other dogs

498
00:13:37,412 --> 00:13:39,539
sniff that business?

499
00:13:37,412 --> 00:13:39,539
I don't think so.

500
00:13:39,581 --> 00:13:42,209
What would you

501
00:13:39,581 --> 00:13:42,209
like to do, Sheldon?

502
00:13:44,170 --> 00:13:46,922
The only fitting send-off:

503
00:13:46,964 --> 00:13:48,174
a Viking funeral.

504
00:13:48,215 --> 00:13:50,009
You mean, like,

505
00:13:48,215 --> 00:13:50,009
push it out into a lake

506
00:13:50,050 --> 00:13:51,593
and shoot it

507
00:13:50,050 --> 00:13:51,593
with a flaming arrow?

508
00:13:51,635 --> 00:13:54,596
This guy gets it.

509
00:13:54,638 --> 00:13:56,473
How about a bathtub

510
00:13:54,638 --> 00:13:56,473
and a match?

511
00:13:56,515 --> 00:13:59,226
How about a bathtub

512
00:13:56,515 --> 00:13:59,226
and a flaming arrow?

513
00:13:59,268 --> 00:14:02,604
How about a bathtub, a match

514
00:13:59,268 --> 00:14:02,604
and an ice-cold Yoo-hoo after?

515
00:14:02,646 --> 00:14:05,398
Sold.

516
00:14:06,692 --> 00:14:08,819
(sighs)

517
00:14:08,861 --> 00:14:11,446
Would you like to say something?

518
00:14:11,488 --> 00:14:13,406
Y-Yes, thank you.

519
00:14:13,448 --> 00:14:17,786
I know this is just

520
00:14:13,448 --> 00:14:17,786
a scientific theory,

521
00:14:17,828 --> 00:14:19,746
but to me, it was

522
00:14:17,828 --> 00:14:19,746
more than that.

523
00:14:19,788 --> 00:14:23,292
It described the universe

524
00:14:19,788 --> 00:14:23,292
in a new and beautiful way.

525
00:14:23,334 --> 00:14:26,628
I want that to be the

526
00:14:23,334 --> 00:14:26,628
universe we live in,

527
00:14:26,670 --> 00:14:29,048
but I guess it's not.

528
00:14:29,089 --> 00:14:33,219
Amy, would you like

529
00:14:29,089 --> 00:14:33,219
to shoot the arrow?

530
00:14:46,815 --> 00:14:48,984
It's kind of beautiful,

531
00:14:46,815 --> 00:14:48,984
isn't it?

532
00:14:49,026 --> 00:14:51,904
Yeah, it is.

533
00:14:55,615 --> 00:14:57,659
It's getting kind of

534
00:14:55,615 --> 00:14:57,659
close to the curtain.

535
00:14:57,701 --> 00:14:58,869
It's in water, it's fine.

536
00:14:58,911 --> 00:15:01,205
Oh!

537
00:14:58,911 --> 00:15:01,205
Oh!

538
00:15:01,247 --> 00:15:03,290
Oh!

539
00:15:03,332 --> 00:15:05,625
Looks like we both had theories

540
00:15:03,332 --> 00:15:05,625
that were wrong.

541
00:15:03,332 --> 00:15:05,625
PENNY: Okay...

542
00:15:10,463 --> 00:15:11,924
Are you getting sick?

543
00:15:11,965 --> 00:15:15,261
No, I have glitter in my nose.

544
00:15:15,302 --> 00:15:17,263
Just your nose?

545
00:15:17,304 --> 00:15:19,139
Consider yourself lucky.

546
00:15:19,181 --> 00:15:20,933
Hey, I'm gonna

547
00:15:20,974 --> 00:15:22,393
take tomorrow off

548
00:15:22,434 --> 00:15:24,311
so we can spend the whole day

549
00:15:22,434 --> 00:15:24,311
running the act.

550
00:15:24,353 --> 00:15:28,982
You know what, it has been

551
00:15:24,353 --> 00:15:28,982
so much fun working on this

552
00:15:29,024 --> 00:15:30,650
with you, but...

553
00:15:29,024 --> 00:15:30,650
But what?

554
00:15:30,692 --> 00:15:32,361
It hasn't.

555
00:15:33,404 --> 00:15:35,155
I'm not gonna audition.

556
00:15:35,197 --> 00:15:36,990
Hey, I didn't raise a quitter.

557
00:15:37,032 --> 00:15:38,742
You didn't raise me at all.

558
00:15:38,784 --> 00:15:41,036
Look,

559
00:15:41,078 --> 00:15:43,663
I get that you're scared, but

560
00:15:41,078 --> 00:15:43,663
we just have to push past that.

561
00:15:43,705 --> 00:15:45,791
I'm not scared.

562
00:15:43,705 --> 00:15:45,791
I don't like the act.

563
00:15:45,832 --> 00:15:47,251
It's over-the-top

564
00:15:47,293 --> 00:15:51,088
and weird and has more

565
00:15:47,293 --> 00:15:51,088
jazz hands than magic.

566
00:15:51,130 --> 00:15:53,215
Why didn't you say

567
00:15:51,130 --> 00:15:53,215
something earlier?

568
00:15:53,257 --> 00:15:55,801
You seemed like

569
00:15:53,257 --> 00:15:55,801
you were so happy,

570
00:15:55,842 --> 00:15:57,177
and then when I tried

571
00:15:55,842 --> 00:15:57,177
to say something,

572
00:15:57,219 --> 00:15:59,930
you seemed like you were so mad.

573
00:15:59,972 --> 00:16:01,848
Hey, this isn't about me.

574
00:16:01,890 --> 00:16:03,309
I just wanted you

575
00:16:01,890 --> 00:16:03,309
to have your dream,

576
00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:05,144
and I wanted

577
00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:05,144
to control everything

578
00:16:05,185 --> 00:16:08,772
about how you looked and acted

579
00:16:05,185 --> 00:16:08,772
so that your victory was mine.

580
00:16:08,814 --> 00:16:12,734
Well, that's honest.

581
00:16:12,776 --> 00:16:15,321
But if I'm gonna

582
00:16:12,776 --> 00:16:15,321
go through with this,

583
00:16:15,362 --> 00:16:17,156
I have to do it my own way.

584
00:16:17,197 --> 00:16:19,032
I respect that,

585
00:16:19,074 --> 00:16:21,118
and I'm glad that I helped

586
00:16:19,074 --> 00:16:21,118
lead you to this moment.

587
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:23,703
Stop trying to make this

588
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:23,703
your victory!

589
00:16:24,997 --> 00:16:27,082
(crowd cheering, whistle blowing

590
00:16:24,997 --> 00:16:27,082
over TV)

591
00:16:36,883 --> 00:16:39,136
Why are you watching that?

592
00:16:39,178 --> 00:16:40,512
I'm just looking to see

593
00:16:40,553 --> 00:16:42,473
if there's anything left

594
00:16:40,553 --> 00:16:42,473
of your speech.

595
00:16:42,514 --> 00:16:45,351
It's not important.

596
00:16:42,514 --> 00:16:45,351
I remember everything I said.

597
00:16:45,392 --> 00:16:47,102
And?

598
00:16:47,144 --> 00:16:51,148
It was good, it just would've

599
00:16:47,144 --> 00:16:51,148
meant more coming from me.

600
00:16:52,899 --> 00:16:55,486
All right, bring it in.

601
00:16:55,527 --> 00:16:56,778
Is that your dad?

602
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:58,322
It is.

603
00:16:58,364 --> 00:17:00,573
I've only seen pictures of him.

604
00:17:00,615 --> 00:17:03,494
I know we're down, by a lot.

605
00:17:03,535 --> 00:17:05,829
And if I'm being

606
00:17:03,535 --> 00:17:05,829
honest with you,

607
00:17:05,871 --> 00:17:07,914
we're probably not

608
00:17:05,871 --> 00:17:07,914
gonna win this one.

609
00:17:07,956 --> 00:17:12,585
In fact, we're definitely not

610
00:17:07,956 --> 00:17:12,585
gonna win this one.

611
00:17:12,627 --> 00:17:15,172
Do you want me to turn it off?

612
00:17:15,214 --> 00:17:17,674
But we're not

613
00:17:15,214 --> 00:17:17,674
gonna quit, either.

614
00:17:17,716 --> 00:17:19,176
And if we do lose,

615
00:17:19,218 --> 00:17:22,262
you need to know

616
00:17:19,218 --> 00:17:22,262
that doesn't make you losers.

617
00:17:22,304 --> 00:17:26,266
You learn as much about who you

618
00:17:22,304 --> 00:17:26,266
are and what you're made of

619
00:17:26,308 --> 00:17:29,811
from failing as you do

620
00:17:26,308 --> 00:17:29,811
from success.

621
00:17:29,853 --> 00:17:32,731
Maybe more.

622
00:17:32,772 --> 00:17:36,109
So you can spend the next half

623
00:17:32,772 --> 00:17:36,109
feeling sorry for yourselves,

624
00:17:36,151 --> 00:17:38,778
or you can get out there

625
00:17:36,151 --> 00:17:38,778
and give them hell.

626
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:40,572
Yeah! Let's give them hell!

627
00:17:40,613 --> 00:17:43,867
Oh— watch your mouth,

628
00:17:40,613 --> 00:17:43,867
your mom might...

629
00:17:43,909 --> 00:17:46,245
I remember that game.

630
00:17:46,286 --> 00:17:48,788
Did they win?

631
00:17:48,830 --> 00:17:50,374
Oh, no.

632
00:17:50,416 --> 00:17:52,167
No, they lost so bad,

633
00:17:50,416 --> 00:17:52,167
the other team

634
00:17:52,209 --> 00:17:56,171
let one of their cheerleaders

635
00:17:52,209 --> 00:17:56,171
try to kick a field goal.

636
00:17:56,213 --> 00:17:59,674
Well, that was a nice speech.

637
00:17:56,213 --> 00:17:59,674
Too bad it didn't work.

638
00:17:59,716 --> 00:18:02,094
Maybe it did.

639
00:18:02,135 --> 00:18:04,596
What do you mean?

640
00:18:04,637 --> 00:18:06,390
I've been acting

641
00:18:04,637 --> 00:18:06,390
like the game is over,

642
00:18:06,432 --> 00:18:08,892
but it's only halftime.

643
00:18:08,934 --> 00:18:11,811
And there's a lot more physics

644
00:18:08,934 --> 00:18:11,811
left to play.

645
00:18:11,853 --> 00:18:16,775
Wow, was that your first ever

646
00:18:11,853 --> 00:18:16,775
sports metaphor?

647
00:18:16,816 --> 00:18:19,819
It was.

648
00:18:19,861 --> 00:18:22,281
And I think it was a home run.

649
00:18:25,242 --> 00:18:27,494
That's two.

650
00:18:27,536 --> 00:18:30,163
It's interesting.

651
00:18:30,205 --> 00:18:33,708
I've always thought that

652
00:18:30,205 --> 00:18:33,708
my father's journey and my own

653
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:39,005
were so different, but he also

654
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:39,005
faced failure and setbacks.

655
00:18:39,047 --> 00:18:43,635
Maybe our lives mirrored each

656
00:18:39,047 --> 00:18:43,635
other more than I thought.

657
00:18:43,676 --> 00:18:48,014
So, from one viewpoint,

658
00:18:48,056 --> 00:18:51,393
you and your father's lives

659
00:18:48,056 --> 00:18:51,393
are asymmetrical,

660
00:18:51,435 --> 00:18:56,648
but from another vantage point,

661
00:18:51,435 --> 00:18:56,648
they're symmetrical.

662
00:18:56,689 --> 00:18:58,233
Sheldon,

663
00:18:58,275 --> 00:19:02,571
what if symmetry and asymmetry

664
00:18:58,275 --> 00:19:02,571
are observer-relative?

665
00:19:02,613 --> 00:19:05,991
That would mean that

666
00:19:02,613 --> 00:19:05,991
the Russian paper was right...

667
00:19:06,032 --> 00:19:08,868
But only from one perspective.

668
00:19:08,910 --> 00:19:11,955
If we look at it from a deeper

669
00:19:08,910 --> 00:19:11,955
view in more dimensions,

670
00:19:11,997 --> 00:19:13,748
our theory still stands.

671
00:19:13,790 --> 00:19:17,127
Not only stands, i-it might be

672
00:19:13,790 --> 00:19:17,127
an even bigger idea

673
00:19:17,169 --> 00:19:19,463
than the one we were

674
00:19:17,169 --> 00:19:19,463
originally proposing.

675
00:19:19,505 --> 00:19:21,381
Go get your laptop.

676
00:19:19,505 --> 00:19:21,381
We have a paper to fix.

677
00:19:21,423 --> 00:19:22,757
(chuckles):

678
00:19:21,423 --> 00:19:22,757
Okay.

679
00:19:27,513 --> 00:19:31,057
Thanks, Dad.

680
00:19:31,099 --> 00:19:32,725
We're gonna give them hell.

681
00:19:38,898 --> 00:19:41,026
Hi, I'm The Great Howdini,

682
00:19:41,067 --> 00:19:43,612
and it's an honor to be

683
00:19:41,067 --> 00:19:43,612
auditioning at the Magic Castle.

684
00:19:43,654 --> 00:19:45,405
Could I borrow your watch, sir?

685
00:19:45,447 --> 00:19:47,282
Sure.

686
00:19:45,447 --> 00:19:47,282
Thank you.

687
00:19:47,324 --> 00:19:51,036
Ooh, Rolex, fancy.

688
00:19:47,324 --> 00:19:51,036
I'll get it right back to you.

689
00:19:51,077 --> 00:19:55,457
Observe:

690
00:19:51,077 --> 00:19:55,457
one very expensive watch,

691
00:19:55,499 --> 00:19:58,210
one wooden mallet.

692
00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:02,797
Do I dare? I do.

693
00:20:06,718 --> 00:20:10,514
Would you be amazed if your

694
00:20:06,718 --> 00:20:10,514
watch survived that pounding?

695
00:20:10,556 --> 00:20:13,684
I think you would— behold.
