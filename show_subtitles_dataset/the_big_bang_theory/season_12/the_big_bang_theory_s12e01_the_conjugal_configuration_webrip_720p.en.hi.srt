1
00:00:06,743 --> 00:00:08,578
Previously

2
00:00:06,743 --> 00:00:08,578
on The Big Bang Theory...

3
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:10,914
Can you believe our little lamb

4
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:10,914
is finally getting married?

5
00:00:10,956 --> 00:00:13,792
He can't believe it.

6
00:00:13,833 --> 00:00:15,877
And neither can I.

7
00:00:15,919 --> 00:00:18,255
(laughing)

8
00:00:15,919 --> 00:00:18,255
Hi, Dad. How you doing?

9
00:00:22,008 --> 00:00:24,761
(voice breaking): Then by

10
00:00:22,008 --> 00:00:24,761
the power vested in me...

11
00:00:24,803 --> 00:00:27,222
by

12
00:00:24,803 --> 00:00:27,222
EvenYouCanPerformWeddings.com...

13
00:00:29,141 --> 00:00:31,559
I now pronounce you

14
00:00:29,141 --> 00:00:31,559
husband and wife.

15
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:34,562
You may kiss the bride.

16
00:00:36,606 --> 00:00:38,650
(crowd cheering)

17
00:00:42,112 --> 00:00:44,448
Good morning, wife.

18
00:00:44,489 --> 00:00:46,032
(chuckles)

19
00:00:46,074 --> 00:00:48,660
Good morning, husband.

20
00:00:48,701 --> 00:00:51,330
I can't believe

21
00:00:48,701 --> 00:00:51,330
we're actually married.

22
00:00:51,371 --> 00:00:53,332
It's official.

23
00:00:51,371 --> 00:00:53,332
According to tradition,

24
00:00:53,373 --> 00:00:54,833
we should hang

25
00:00:53,373 --> 00:00:54,833
the bedsheets outside

26
00:00:54,874 --> 00:00:58,170
so the villagers can see

27
00:00:54,874 --> 00:00:58,170
that we consummated.

28
00:00:58,211 --> 00:01:00,005
I don't think that

29
00:00:58,211 --> 00:01:00,005
that's appropriate,

30
00:01:00,046 --> 00:01:02,382
considering where we're

31
00:01:00,046 --> 00:01:02,382
starting our honeymoon.

32
00:01:02,424 --> 00:01:04,509
Well, I suppose you're right.

33
00:01:06,928 --> 00:01:08,805
Although,

34
00:01:06,928 --> 00:01:08,805
when you think about it,

35
00:01:08,847 --> 00:01:11,850
Lego is the perfect metaphor

36
00:01:08,847 --> 00:01:11,850
for marital congress.

37
00:01:11,891 --> 00:01:16,062
Two pieces that interlock

38
00:01:11,891 --> 00:01:16,062
with a satisfying snap.

39
00:01:16,104 --> 00:01:20,317
Oh, that's the sound

40
00:01:16,104 --> 00:01:20,317
you were making.

41
00:01:20,359 --> 00:01:21,818
Oh, I almost forgot.

42
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:24,946
While you were sleeping,

43
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:24,946
I ordered room service.

44
00:01:24,988 --> 00:01:26,698
Really?

45
00:01:26,739 --> 00:01:28,492
Voila!

46
00:01:30,243 --> 00:01:33,537
You thought it was going

47
00:01:30,243 --> 00:01:33,537

Amy away on their honeymoon?

64
00:02:00,857 --> 00:02:03,651
Yeah, because now Leonard and

65
00:02:00,857 --> 00:02:03,651
I get all this alone time.

66
00:02:03,693 --> 00:02:05,237
But you're not alone.

67
00:02:03,693 --> 00:02:05,237
We're here.

68
00:02:05,278 --> 00:02:07,364
Yes. (sighs)

69
00:02:05,278 --> 00:02:07,364
Yes, you are.

70
00:02:07,406 --> 00:02:11,159
BERNADETTE:

71
00:02:07,406 --> 00:02:11,159
Would you like us to leave so

72
00:02:07,406 --> 00:02:11,159
you and Leonard can talk about

73
00:02:11,201 --> 00:02:12,869
all the things

74
00:02:11,201 --> 00:02:12,869
you have in common?

75
00:02:12,911 --> 00:02:16,706
LEONARD: Ha, ha, she

76
00:02:12,911 --> 00:02:16,706
called your bluff.

77
00:02:16,748 --> 00:02:18,542
KOOTHRAPPALI: So, something

78
00:02:16,748 --> 00:02:18,542
pretty cool happened.

79
00:02:18,583 --> 00:02:20,585
Channel 3 asked me to be

80
00:02:18,583 --> 00:02:20,585
on the news tomorrow night

81
00:02:20,626 --> 00:02:22,003
to talk about

82
00:02:20,626 --> 00:02:22,003
the meteor shower.

83
00:02:22,045 --> 00:02:23,796
Oh, that's great.

84
00:02:22,045 --> 00:02:23,796
Hey!

85
00:02:22,045 --> 00:02:23,796
Congratulations.

86
00:02:23,838 --> 00:02:25,965
You know, that's how Neil

87
00:02:23,838 --> 00:02:25,965
deGrasse Tyson got his start.

88
00:02:26,007 --> 00:02:27,509
He went from the

89
00:02:26,007 --> 00:02:27,509
Hayden Planetarium

90
00:02:27,551 --> 00:02:29,386
to guesting on

91
00:02:27,551 --> 00:02:29,386
the local news

92
00:02:29,428 --> 00:02:32,556
to ruining everyone's

93
00:02:29,428 --> 00:02:32,556
favorite movies on the Internet.

94
00:02:32,597 --> 00:02:33,806
KOOTHRAPPALI:

95
00:02:32,597 --> 00:02:33,806
Now it's happening to me.

96
00:02:33,848 --> 00:02:35,475
Ooh, I should probably

97
00:02:33,848 --> 00:02:35,475
make a list

98
00:02:35,517 --> 00:02:40,021
of all the scientific

99
00:02:35,517 --> 00:02:40,021
inaccuracies in Mamma Mia 2.

100
00:02:40,063 --> 00:02:43,024
You're gonna go on live TV and

101
00:02:40,063 --> 00:02:43,024
admit you've seen that movie?

102
00:02:43,066 --> 00:02:45,235
Hey, your husband's

103
00:02:43,066 --> 00:02:45,235
the one who took me.

104
00:02:46,861 --> 00:02:49,573
Meryl Streep and Cher?

105
00:02:46,861 --> 00:02:49,573
Yeah, I saw it.

106
00:02:51,366 --> 00:02:53,159
(loud noise)

107
00:02:53,201 --> 00:02:54,953
Sounds like

108
00:02:53,201 --> 00:02:54,953
someone's in there.

109
00:02:54,994 --> 00:02:57,914
My God, what if Sheldon

110
00:02:54,994 --> 00:02:57,914
and Amy are getting robbed?

111
00:02:57,956 --> 00:03:01,709
Or worse, what if

112
00:02:57,956 --> 00:03:01,709
they're back early?

113
00:03:01,751 --> 00:03:03,295
They're not; they

114
00:03:01,751 --> 00:03:03,295
just posted a picture

115
00:03:03,336 --> 00:03:04,796
in front of the

116
00:03:03,336 --> 00:03:04,796
Statue of Liberty.

117
00:03:04,837 --> 00:03:07,257
Real or Lego?

118
00:03:04,837 --> 00:03:07,257
Lego.

119
00:03:07,299 --> 00:03:09,593
So, what should we do?

120
00:03:07,299 --> 00:03:09,593
Should someone go check it out?

121
00:03:09,633 --> 00:03:12,053
I would, but I got to

122
00:03:09,633 --> 00:03:12,053
be on TV tomorrow.

123
00:03:12,095 --> 00:03:14,264
Got to protect the money.

124
00:03:16,475 --> 00:03:18,310
Oh, yeah, someone's

125
00:03:16,475 --> 00:03:18,310
definitely in there.

126
00:03:18,351 --> 00:03:19,936
Okay, let's go into

127
00:03:18,351 --> 00:03:19,936
our apartment.

128
00:03:19,978 --> 00:03:21,729
We'll lock the door,

129
00:03:19,978 --> 00:03:21,729
we'll call the pol...

130
00:03:21,771 --> 00:03:23,815
Hello? Anyone in there?

131
00:03:25,817 --> 00:03:27,360
Yes?

132
00:03:25,817 --> 00:03:27,360
Oh, uh, Mr. Fowler.

133
00:03:27,402 --> 00:03:29,112
Sorry, we didn't

134
00:03:27,402 --> 00:03:29,112
know you were here.

135
00:03:29,154 --> 00:03:31,573
We-we actually thought someone

136
00:03:29,154 --> 00:03:31,573
was breaking in. (chuckles)

137
00:03:31,615 --> 00:03:33,783
And we were ready

138
00:03:31,615 --> 00:03:33,783
to take them down.

139
00:03:35,076 --> 00:03:37,120
Amy asked me

140
00:03:35,076 --> 00:03:37,120
to water her plants.

141
00:03:37,162 --> 00:03:38,580
She doesn't have

142
00:03:37,162 --> 00:03:38,580
any plants.

143
00:03:38,622 --> 00:03:40,290
Oh.

144
00:03:40,332 --> 00:03:42,584
Well, you caught me

145
00:03:40,332 --> 00:03:42,584
in a lie.

146
00:03:42,626 --> 00:03:44,669
Have a good day.

147
00:03:50,716 --> 00:03:52,677
That was weird, right?

148
00:03:52,718 --> 00:03:55,221
Was it?

149
00:03:52,718 --> 00:03:55,221
I-I honestly can't tell anymore.

150
00:03:55,263 --> 00:03:57,682
Hey, did you even see

151
00:03:55,263 --> 00:03:57,682
Mamma Mia 1?

152
00:03:57,723 --> 00:03:59,851
Didn't need to.

153
00:03:57,723 --> 00:03:59,851
The sequel stands on its own.

154
00:04:13,657 --> 00:04:15,700
Here you go.

155
00:04:15,741 --> 00:04:18,411
If you need any recommendations

156
00:04:15,741 --> 00:04:18,411
while visiting New York,

157
00:04:18,453 --> 00:04:20,872
please don't hesitate

158
00:04:18,453 --> 00:04:20,872
to contact me.

159
00:04:20,913 --> 00:04:22,832
Well, it is our honeymoon.

160
00:04:22,874 --> 00:04:24,626
So we are going

161
00:04:22,874 --> 00:04:24,626
to be quite busy.

162
00:04:24,668 --> 00:04:25,918
Got it.

163
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:29,464
Harry Potter play,

164
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:29,464
parts one and two.

165
00:04:29,506 --> 00:04:31,216
And tomorrow,

166
00:04:29,506 --> 00:04:31,216
a tour of the sites

167
00:04:31,257 --> 00:04:34,636
where Nikola Tesla lived,

168
00:04:31,257 --> 00:04:34,636
worked and slowly went crazy.

169
00:04:35,595 --> 00:04:37,972
And, of course, coitus.

170
00:04:39,224 --> 00:04:41,685
Ah.

171
00:04:41,726 --> 00:04:44,812
Well, enjoy New York.

172
00:04:41,726 --> 00:04:44,812
And, I guess, coitus.

173
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:51,110
Really, Sheldon?

174
00:04:51,152 --> 00:04:53,572
You want to do it again?

175
00:04:53,613 --> 00:04:55,365
Don't act surprised.

176
00:04:55,407 --> 00:04:57,283
It's clearly marked

177
00:04:55,407 --> 00:04:57,283
on the schedule.

178
00:04:57,325 --> 00:04:58,784
Now,

179
00:04:58,826 --> 00:05:01,705
shall we steam the wrinkles

180
00:04:58,826 --> 00:05:01,705
out of our wizard robes,

181
00:05:01,746 --> 00:05:04,999
or make vigorous,

182
00:05:01,746 --> 00:05:04,999
socially sanctioned love?

183
00:05:05,041 --> 00:05:07,877
Either way, I can check

184
00:05:05,041 --> 00:05:07,877
something off my to-do list.

185
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:11,047
Socially sanc— Oh, wow.

186
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:11,047
Yeah, there it is right there.

187
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:16,135
Uh, hurry.

188
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:16,135
Raj is on next.

189
00:05:16,177 --> 00:05:18,846
All right. I can't believe

190
00:05:16,177 --> 00:05:18,846
they canceled Vampire Diaries

191
00:05:18,888 --> 00:05:20,265
but they'll show this.

192
00:05:22,434 --> 00:05:24,852
This is the news.

193
00:05:24,894 --> 00:05:28,314
And that was a woman torn

194
00:05:24,894 --> 00:05:28,314
between two hunky vampires.

195
00:05:28,356 --> 00:05:29,941
What is your point?

196
00:05:29,982 --> 00:05:31,317
(pounding on door across hall)

197
00:05:31,359 --> 00:05:35,530
MRS. FOWLER:

198
00:05:31,359 --> 00:05:35,530
Larry? I know you're in there!

199
00:05:35,572 --> 00:05:36,698
Is that Amy's mom?

200
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:38,199
MRS. FOWLER:

201
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:38,199
Let me in.

202
00:05:38,241 --> 00:05:40,452
(shouting):

203
00:05:38,241 --> 00:05:40,452
Let me in!

204
00:05:42,412 --> 00:05:45,164
Either that or the Big Bad Wolf.

205
00:05:47,459 --> 00:05:48,960
Larry?

206
00:05:49,001 --> 00:05:51,254
Mrs. Fowler,

207
00:05:49,001 --> 00:05:51,254
are you okay?

208
00:05:51,296 --> 00:05:54,424
Oh, I'm okay. It's my husband

209
00:05:51,296 --> 00:05:54,424
you should worry about.

210
00:05:54,466 --> 00:05:55,759
Oh, we do.

211
00:05:55,799 --> 00:05:57,009
(knocks)

212
00:05:57,051 --> 00:05:58,678
Larry, come on.

213
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,930
I don't think he's in there.

214
00:06:03,349 --> 00:06:06,144
I mean, he came by to water

215
00:06:03,349 --> 00:06:06,144
the imaginary plants,

216
00:06:06,185 --> 00:06:07,811
but then he left.

217
00:06:07,853 --> 00:06:09,564
You are so naive.

218
00:06:09,606 --> 00:06:12,358
Blondie here is gonna

219
00:06:09,606 --> 00:06:12,358
chew you up and spit you out.

220
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:15,654
Well, don't tell him.

221
00:06:17,405 --> 00:06:19,865
Come on, you have an extra key.

222
00:06:17,405 --> 00:06:19,865
Open it up.

223
00:06:19,907 --> 00:06:22,494
All right,

224
00:06:19,907 --> 00:06:22,494
but I'm telling you

225
00:06:22,535 --> 00:06:25,288
he's not in there.

226
00:06:26,539 --> 00:06:28,667
There. See?

227
00:06:28,708 --> 00:06:30,376
Oh, he's in here.

228
00:06:30,418 --> 00:06:33,921
I can smell his Axe body spray.

229
00:06:33,963 --> 00:06:35,632
He wears Axe body spray.

230
00:06:35,674 --> 00:06:38,092
You happy? You smell

231
00:06:35,674 --> 00:06:38,092
like Amy's dad.

232
00:06:41,012 --> 00:06:42,639
Larry?

233
00:06:41,012 --> 00:06:42,639
Ooh, come on.

234
00:06:42,681 --> 00:06:45,141
Ah, shouldn't we mind

235
00:06:42,681 --> 00:06:45,141
our own business?

236
00:06:45,183 --> 00:06:48,144
Wow, sometimes it's like

237
00:06:45,183 --> 00:06:48,144
you don't know me at all.

238
00:06:50,396 --> 00:06:52,816
See, he's not here.

239
00:06:52,856 --> 00:06:55,193
You don't know him

240
00:06:52,856 --> 00:06:55,193
like I do.

241
00:06:55,234 --> 00:06:57,612
To be fair, we don't

242
00:06:55,234 --> 00:06:57,612
know either of you.

243
00:07:00,406 --> 00:07:01,991
Satisfied?

244
00:07:07,997 --> 00:07:10,082
Oh, yeah, now I smell him.

245
00:07:13,002 --> 00:07:17,549
Man, that is one

246
00:07:13,002 --> 00:07:17,549
hot weather girl.

247
00:07:17,590 --> 00:07:20,301
How come if I say that

248
00:07:17,590 --> 00:07:20,301
I get in trouble?

249
00:07:20,343 --> 00:07:23,137
You want to say it?

250
00:07:20,343 --> 00:07:23,137
You can say it.

251
00:07:29,268 --> 00:07:31,187
Nice try.

252
00:07:31,229 --> 00:07:33,439
You're gonna have to find

253
00:07:31,229 --> 00:07:33,439
some other way

254
00:07:33,481 --> 00:07:35,941
to not have sex

255
00:07:33,481 --> 00:07:35,941
with me tonight.

256
00:07:35,983 --> 00:07:38,444
And it's not weather girl,

257
00:07:35,983 --> 00:07:38,444
it's weather woman.

258
00:07:38,486 --> 00:07:39,863
(scoffs)

259
00:07:39,904 --> 00:07:41,656
And with us today

260
00:07:39,904 --> 00:07:41,656
to talk about

261
00:07:41,698 --> 00:07:43,908
the upcoming meteor shower and

262
00:07:41,698 --> 00:07:43,908
the best places to view it,

263
00:07:43,949 --> 00:07:48,705
Caltech astrophysicist

264
00:07:43,949 --> 00:07:48,705
Dr. Rajesh Koothrappali.

265
00:07:48,747 --> 00:07:51,541
Thank you for being here.

266
00:07:48,747 --> 00:07:51,541
Thank you for having me.

267
00:07:51,583 --> 00:07:53,835
I guess Neil deGrasse Tyson

268
00:07:51,583 --> 00:07:53,835
was unavailable.

269
00:07:53,877 --> 00:07:56,713
(laughs)

270
00:07:53,877 --> 00:07:56,713
Yeah.

271
00:07:58,673 --> 00:08:00,383
What do you mean, "yeah"?

272
00:08:00,425 --> 00:08:01,885
Not important.

273
00:08:01,926 --> 00:08:04,136
So, what can we expect

274
00:08:01,926 --> 00:08:04,136
to see from

275
00:08:04,178 --> 00:08:05,847
this meteor shower?

276
00:08:05,889 --> 00:08:08,433
Well, I think you can count

277
00:08:05,889 --> 00:08:08,433
on a lot of flaming gas,

278
00:08:08,474 --> 00:08:09,934
which is what

279
00:08:08,474 --> 00:08:09,934
you would have gotten

280
00:08:09,975 --> 00:08:13,104
from your first choice,

281
00:08:09,975 --> 00:08:13,104
Neil deGrasse Tyson.

282
00:08:13,145 --> 00:08:16,274
Pull up, Raj, pull up!

283
00:08:16,315 --> 00:08:20,319
Sounds like there's no love lost

284
00:08:16,315 --> 00:08:20,319
between you and Dr. Tyson.

285
00:08:20,361 --> 00:08:22,196
Oh, no, I love Neil.

286
00:08:22,238 --> 00:08:25,157
I mean, not as much as Neil

287
00:08:22,238 --> 00:08:25,157
loves Neil, but who does, right?

288
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:26,618
(chuckling)

289
00:08:26,659 --> 00:08:30,705
I want to look away,

290
00:08:26,659 --> 00:08:30,705
but I can't.

291
00:08:30,747 --> 00:08:33,750
Oh, you know, I'm told we

292
00:08:30,747 --> 00:08:33,750
are out of time, (chuckles)

293
00:08:33,792 --> 00:08:36,711
having learned nothing

294
00:08:33,792 --> 00:08:36,711
about meteor showers

295
00:08:36,753 --> 00:08:40,089
and too much about

296
00:08:36,753 --> 00:08:40,089
Dr. Koothrappali.

297
00:08:40,131 --> 00:08:42,759
Thank you.

298
00:08:47,472 --> 00:08:50,141
Do you know what I love

299
00:08:47,472 --> 00:08:50,141
about Broadway theater?

300
00:08:50,182 --> 00:08:51,893
It's so interactive.

301
00:08:51,935 --> 00:08:53,895
Uh-huh.

302
00:08:53,937 --> 00:08:56,856
You're so close to the actors.

303
00:08:53,937 --> 00:08:56,856
It's like you're in the play.

304
00:08:56,898 --> 00:08:58,399
Uh-huh.

305
00:08:58,441 --> 00:08:59,901
I mean, you yell,

306
00:08:58,441 --> 00:08:59,901
"Harry, watch out,"

307
00:08:59,943 --> 00:09:01,611
he looks right at you.

308
00:09:01,653 --> 00:09:04,739
And not just Harry,

309
00:09:01,653 --> 00:09:04,739
everyone onstage.

310
00:09:04,781 --> 00:09:08,576
At the risk of sounding

311
00:09:04,781 --> 00:09:08,576
redundant, uh-huh.

312
00:09:08,618 --> 00:09:10,495
All right, well,

313
00:09:08,618 --> 00:09:10,495
it's a bit late,

314
00:09:10,536 --> 00:09:12,455
but I did block out

315
00:09:10,536 --> 00:09:12,455
the rest of the evening

316
00:09:12,497 --> 00:09:13,539
for conjugal relations.

317
00:09:13,581 --> 00:09:15,374
Should we shower?

318
00:09:15,416 --> 00:09:16,876
I mean before, not during.

319
00:09:16,918 --> 00:09:19,211
That's how you fall

320
00:09:16,918 --> 00:09:19,211
and break a hip.

321
00:09:19,253 --> 00:09:20,588
You know,

322
00:09:19,253 --> 00:09:20,588
I'm a little jet-laggy.

323
00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:22,548
Maybe we can revisit this

324
00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:22,548
in the morning.

325
00:09:22,590 --> 00:09:24,759
Oh, no can do.

326
00:09:22,590 --> 00:09:24,759
If we miss tonight,

327
00:09:24,801 --> 00:09:26,803
it's not scheduled

328
00:09:24,801 --> 00:09:26,803
until Thursday at 6:00.

329
00:09:26,845 --> 00:09:28,721
And that'll have

330
00:09:26,845 --> 00:09:28,721
to be "no frills,"

331
00:09:28,763 --> 00:09:31,349
'cause we've got a 6:30

332
00:09:28,763 --> 00:09:31,349
reservation at Benihana.

333
00:09:31,390 --> 00:09:34,811
Sheldon, do we really

334
00:09:31,390 --> 00:09:34,811
have to do this on a schedule?

335
00:09:34,853 --> 00:09:37,730
Are you suggesting spontaneity?

336
00:09:37,772 --> 00:09:39,941
I-I guess, yeah.

337
00:09:39,983 --> 00:09:43,402
So, now that we're married,

338
00:09:39,983 --> 00:09:43,402
sex can occur at any time?

339
00:09:43,444 --> 00:09:45,154
Like, we can be

340
00:09:43,444 --> 00:09:45,154
brushing our teeth,

341
00:09:45,196 --> 00:09:47,072
and suddenly your minty-fresh

342
00:09:45,196 --> 00:09:47,072
tongue is in my mouth?

343
00:09:47,114 --> 00:09:48,616
No, thank you.

344
00:09:48,658 --> 00:09:51,619
Really? Would it be so bad

345
00:09:48,658 --> 00:09:51,619
to mix it up a little?

346
00:09:51,661 --> 00:09:54,079
Mix it up?

347
00:09:51,661 --> 00:09:54,079
Who are you, Betty Crocker?

348
00:09:54,121 --> 00:09:56,332
Where are you going?

349
00:09:56,374 --> 00:09:57,792
Uh, to take a shower.

350
00:09:57,834 --> 00:09:59,711
Now that sex can happen

351
00:09:57,834 --> 00:09:59,711
at any time,

352
00:09:59,752 --> 00:10:01,796
I always have to be ready.

353
00:10:01,838 --> 00:10:04,298
Should probably live

354
00:10:01,838 --> 00:10:04,298
under a waterfall.

355
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:06,342
Well, you don't have to worry

356
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:06,342
about sex happening tonight.

357
00:10:06,384 --> 00:10:09,554
Oh. Well, thanks,

358
00:10:06,384 --> 00:10:09,554
but I'm still gonna rinse off.

359
00:10:09,595 --> 00:10:12,181
I touched a lot of stuff

360
00:10:09,595 --> 00:10:12,181
in the gift shop.

361
00:10:14,851 --> 00:10:18,521
No message, no note.

362
00:10:14,851 --> 00:10:18,521
Who would do that?

363
00:10:18,563 --> 00:10:19,898
What kind of

364
00:10:18,563 --> 00:10:19,898
husband would...

365
00:10:19,939 --> 00:10:21,900
If you let him talk,

366
00:10:19,939 --> 00:10:21,900
maybe you'll find out.

367
00:10:21,941 --> 00:10:25,028
Fine. Larry?

368
00:10:28,614 --> 00:10:31,242
Well, there you go.

369
00:10:28,614 --> 00:10:31,242
What more can he say?

370
00:10:31,283 --> 00:10:32,410
Let's go home.

371
00:10:32,451 --> 00:10:35,413
I think I'll stay.

372
00:10:35,454 --> 00:10:39,166
Well, if you're going to stay,

373
00:10:35,454 --> 00:10:39,166
then I'll stay.

374
00:10:39,208 --> 00:10:41,502
All right, well, you know

375
00:10:39,208 --> 00:10:41,502
who doesn't need to stay?

376
00:10:41,544 --> 00:10:42,754
Us. Come on.

377
00:10:46,131 --> 00:10:48,092
Penny, come on.

378
00:10:48,133 --> 00:10:49,343
Aw.

379
00:10:53,890 --> 00:10:57,226
I don't think those two

380
00:10:53,890 --> 00:10:57,226
are gonna make it.

381
00:11:02,273 --> 00:11:04,609
Poor Mr. Fowler, I really feel

382
00:11:02,273 --> 00:11:04,609
sorry for the little guy.

383
00:11:04,650 --> 00:11:06,402
I know. After they had Amy,

384
00:11:06,444 --> 00:11:09,614
she should've just eaten him

385
00:11:06,444 --> 00:11:09,614
and been done with it.

386
00:11:09,655 --> 00:11:13,826
Look at you retaining facts

387
00:11:09,655 --> 00:11:13,826
from a nature show. (chuckles)

388
00:11:13,868 --> 00:11:16,871
I know, really,

389
00:11:13,868 --> 00:11:16,871
what did he ever see in her?

390
00:11:16,913 --> 00:11:19,373
He's so, so sweet, and

391
00:11:16,913 --> 00:11:19,373
she's such a ballbuster.

392
00:11:19,415 --> 00:11:22,001
Some guys think

393
00:11:19,415 --> 00:11:22,001
strong women are sexy.

394
00:11:22,043 --> 00:11:23,878
Yeah, but they seem to have

395
00:11:22,043 --> 00:11:23,878
nothing in common.

396
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:28,131
Yeah, well, sometimes

397
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:28,131
opposites attract.

398
00:11:28,173 --> 00:11:32,177
Wait, are-are you saying

399
00:11:28,173 --> 00:11:32,177
we are like them?

400
00:11:32,219 --> 00:11:34,847
I don't know, maybe a little.

401
00:11:34,889 --> 00:11:39,769
So you're the sweet, quiet one

402
00:11:34,889 --> 00:11:39,769
and I'm Amy's mom?

403
00:11:39,811 --> 00:11:42,229
Is that what you're saying?

404
00:11:51,154 --> 00:11:54,325
Hey, check out what Neil

405
00:11:51,154 --> 00:11:54,325
deGrasse Tyson just tweeted.

406
00:11:54,366 --> 00:11:56,035
"I've been informed

407
00:11:54,366 --> 00:11:56,035
that some random,

408
00:11:56,077 --> 00:11:57,411
attention-seeking nobody

409
00:11:57,453 --> 00:12:00,163
took a cheap shot at me

410
00:11:57,453 --> 00:12:00,163
on the local news."

411
00:12:00,205 --> 00:12:03,918
That's me.

412
00:12:00,205 --> 00:12:03,918
Guys, he's talking about me!

413
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:05,795
You know, I cut you

414
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:05,795
a lot of slack

415
00:12:05,837 --> 00:12:07,296
'cause you come

416
00:12:05,837 --> 00:12:07,296
from another country,

417
00:12:07,338 --> 00:12:11,134
but you've been here

418
00:12:07,338 --> 00:12:11,134
a long time.

419
00:12:11,174 --> 00:12:13,678
Raj, you need to apologize

420
00:12:11,174 --> 00:12:13,678
to Dr. Tyson.

421
00:12:13,719 --> 00:12:15,847
Why? This could be good for me.

422
00:12:15,888 --> 00:12:18,057
Everybody loves

423
00:12:15,888 --> 00:12:18,057
a good Twitter feud.

424
00:12:18,099 --> 00:12:19,475
Neil and I

425
00:12:18,099 --> 00:12:19,475
could be like

426
00:12:19,517 --> 00:12:22,394
the new, uh, Katy Perry

427
00:12:19,517 --> 00:12:22,394
and Taylor Swift.

428
00:12:22,436 --> 00:12:24,063
Come on, Raj,

429
00:12:22,436 --> 00:12:24,063
you're better than this.

430
00:12:24,105 --> 00:12:25,606
Oh, leave room for dessert

431
00:12:25,648 --> 00:12:27,566
'cause I'm gonna

432
00:12:25,648 --> 00:12:27,566
make you eat those words.

433
00:12:27,608 --> 00:12:30,945
(clears throat)

434
00:12:27,608 --> 00:12:30,945
"Dear Dr. Tyson,

435
00:12:30,987 --> 00:12:33,489
"much like epithelial tissue,

436
00:12:33,531 --> 00:12:36,199
it appears I've gotten

437
00:12:33,531 --> 00:12:36,199
under your skin."

438
00:12:36,241 --> 00:12:38,536
iPhone drop,

439
00:12:38,577 --> 00:12:41,413
but I won't

440
00:12:38,577 --> 00:12:41,413
'cause I don't have AppleCare.

441
00:12:41,455 --> 00:12:44,834
(phone chimes)

442
00:12:41,455 --> 00:12:44,834
What'd he say?

443
00:12:44,876 --> 00:12:49,505
"Nice try, genius.

444
00:12:44,876 --> 00:12:49,505
The skin is epithelial tissue."

445
00:12:50,715 --> 00:12:52,175
Oh, it's on.

446
00:12:52,215 --> 00:12:56,387
He's Katy, I'm T-Swift.

447
00:12:52,215 --> 00:12:56,387
(clears throat)

448
00:12:59,682 --> 00:13:03,728
What are you gonna do?

449
00:12:59,682 --> 00:13:03,728
He's from another country.

450
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:09,192
TOUR GUIDE: And here we have

451
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:09,192
the former hotel where Tesla

452
00:13:09,232 --> 00:13:11,986
perfected the three-phase

453
00:13:09,232 --> 00:13:11,986
alternating current motor.

454
00:13:12,028 --> 00:13:13,529
That's wrong.

455
00:13:12,028 --> 00:13:13,529
I'm gonna say something.

456
00:13:13,571 --> 00:13:15,322
Don't.

457
00:13:15,364 --> 00:13:18,993
Well, then how will everyone

458
00:13:15,364 --> 00:13:18,993
know I'm the smartest boy here?

459
00:13:19,035 --> 00:13:20,828
Just let it go.

460
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:22,496
Is everything all right?

461
00:13:22,538 --> 00:13:24,207
You seem testy

462
00:13:22,538 --> 00:13:24,207
this morning.

463
00:13:24,247 --> 00:13:25,499
I'm not testy.

464
00:13:25,541 --> 00:13:27,001
I'll have to take

465
00:13:25,541 --> 00:13:27,001
your word for it.

466
00:13:27,043 --> 00:13:29,712
There's no test for testy.

467
00:13:29,754 --> 00:13:32,882
Is it possible that

468
00:13:29,754 --> 00:13:32,882
you're sexually frustrated?

469
00:13:32,924 --> 00:13:34,800
Okay, now I'm testy.

470
00:13:34,842 --> 00:13:37,220
If you had adhered

471
00:13:34,842 --> 00:13:37,220
to my coital schedule,

472
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:39,931
your brain would be floating

473
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:39,931
on a sea of oxytocin right now.

474
00:13:39,972 --> 00:13:43,017
Don't talk to me about my brain.

475
00:13:39,972 --> 00:13:43,017
I'm a neurobiologist.

476
00:13:43,059 --> 00:13:45,686
Then you should know

477
00:13:43,059 --> 00:13:45,686
the benefits of the special hug

478
00:13:45,728 --> 00:13:47,688
that grown-ups

479
00:13:45,728 --> 00:13:47,688
give each other.

480
00:13:49,356 --> 00:13:51,316
Sheldon, everybody's

481
00:13:49,356 --> 00:13:51,316
listening.

482
00:13:51,358 --> 00:13:53,611
Of course they're listening;

483
00:13:51,358 --> 00:13:53,611
we're interesting.

484
00:13:53,652 --> 00:13:54,862
Unlike that guy.

485
00:13:56,488 --> 00:13:58,365
I-I'm walking

486
00:13:56,488 --> 00:13:58,365
away from you.

487
00:14:03,495 --> 00:14:05,372
I'm only

488
00:14:03,495 --> 00:14:05,372
recently married.

489
00:14:05,414 --> 00:14:08,375
Do I stay here? Do I follow?

490
00:14:05,414 --> 00:14:08,375
Say something useful.

491
00:14:16,884 --> 00:14:18,761
Morning, sunshine.

492
00:14:21,222 --> 00:14:23,891
So I see you're making espresso.

493
00:14:23,933 --> 00:14:24,850
Yup.

494
00:14:24,892 --> 00:14:26,644
Just need that extra jolt

495
00:14:26,685 --> 00:14:30,273
for a successful day

496
00:14:26,685 --> 00:14:30,273
of ballbusting.

497
00:14:30,314 --> 00:14:33,442
Really? I don't,

498
00:14:30,314 --> 00:14:33,442
I don't think you do.

499
00:14:33,484 --> 00:14:36,862
You know, you compared us to

500
00:14:33,484 --> 00:14:36,862
the strangest couple we know,

501
00:14:36,904 --> 00:14:38,489
and we know

502
00:14:36,904 --> 00:14:38,489
Amy and Sheldon,

503
00:14:38,530 --> 00:14:42,118
Howard and Bernadette,

504
00:14:38,530 --> 00:14:42,118
Raj and his twitchy little dog.

505
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:44,578
I-I'm sorry.

506
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:44,578
I shouldn't have said that.

507
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:46,664
Because it wasn't nice

508
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:46,664
or because it wasn't true?

509
00:14:46,705 --> 00:14:48,582
It's not true. (stammers)

510
00:14:48,624 --> 00:14:51,627
Mrs. Fowler is an angry,

511
00:14:48,624 --> 00:14:51,627
vindictive woman,

512
00:14:51,669 --> 00:14:54,672
whereas you are warm

513
00:14:51,669 --> 00:14:54,672
and-and loving,

514
00:14:54,713 --> 00:14:56,174
quick to forgive.

515
00:14:56,215 --> 00:14:58,009
Oh, please.

516
00:14:58,050 --> 00:15:01,179
I-I'm serious.

517
00:14:58,050 --> 00:15:01,179
And I'm nothing like Amy's dad.

518
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:03,931
He's a mousy little man

519
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:03,931
who can't stand up for himself.

520
00:15:06,391 --> 00:15:10,104
My point is you're not like her,

521
00:15:06,391 --> 00:15:10,104
so we're not like them.

522
00:15:10,146 --> 00:15:13,232
Well, 30 years from now,

523
00:15:10,146 --> 00:15:13,232
are you gonna hide from me

524
00:15:13,274 --> 00:15:14,817
because I'm so scary?

525
00:15:14,859 --> 00:15:18,112
Hey, I-I don't think

526
00:15:14,859 --> 00:15:18,112
you're scary.

527
00:15:18,154 --> 00:15:22,574
Yes, I flinch when

528
00:15:18,154 --> 00:15:22,574
you make sudden moves, but...

529
00:15:22,616 --> 00:15:25,452
that says more about

530
00:15:22,616 --> 00:15:25,452
my childhood than you.

531
00:15:25,494 --> 00:15:26,912
Aw.

532
00:15:33,752 --> 00:15:35,129
Your turn.

533
00:15:35,171 --> 00:15:37,464
Hang on, I'm checking

534
00:15:35,171 --> 00:15:37,464
to see if Neil replied

535
00:15:37,506 --> 00:15:39,591
to my latest

536
00:15:37,506 --> 00:15:39,591
smackdown.

537
00:15:39,633 --> 00:15:42,345
Really? Don't you think this

538
00:15:39,633 --> 00:15:42,345
Twitter feud is a little silly?

539
00:15:42,386 --> 00:15:43,721
Absolutely not.

540
00:15:43,762 --> 00:15:45,806
It's-it's two

541
00:15:43,762 --> 00:15:45,806
respected scientists

542
00:15:45,848 --> 00:15:47,808
debating opposing views

543
00:15:45,848 --> 00:15:47,808
in a public forum.

544
00:15:47,850 --> 00:15:51,436
You called him

545
00:15:47,850 --> 00:15:51,436
Mike Tyson's little sister.

546
00:15:51,478 --> 00:15:55,399
Yeah, and now Mike Tyson's

547
00:15:51,478 --> 00:15:55,399
mad at me, too.

548
00:15:57,026 --> 00:16:00,321
Raj, you're not going to impress

549
00:15:57,026 --> 00:16:00,321
anyone by attacking him.

550
00:16:00,363 --> 00:16:04,075
Oh, Bernadette,

551
00:16:00,363 --> 00:16:04,075
you sound so old right now.

552
00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:11,207
He said he needs a break,

553
00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:11,207
and I'm too much for him.

554
00:16:11,249 --> 00:16:13,584
Oh. I'm sure he

555
00:16:11,249 --> 00:16:13,584
didn't mean that.

556
00:16:13,625 --> 00:16:16,295
He said I'm overbearing!

557
00:16:16,337 --> 00:16:20,341
Oh, please, you're just

558
00:16:16,337 --> 00:16:20,341
the right amount of bearing.

559
00:16:21,425 --> 00:16:23,427
Look, I know he loves you.

560
00:16:23,468 --> 00:16:26,180
If you just give him some space,

561
00:16:23,468 --> 00:16:26,180
I'm sure he'll come back.

562
00:16:26,222 --> 00:16:27,932
You really think so?

563
00:16:27,973 --> 00:16:29,558
Yeah, I do.

564
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:33,354
You're a good person, Penny.

565
00:16:33,396 --> 00:16:37,358
I hope we get to spend

566
00:16:33,396 --> 00:16:37,358
lots of time together.

567
00:16:40,361 --> 00:16:42,696
Me, too.

568
00:16:44,656 --> 00:16:47,201
Yes?

569
00:16:44,656 --> 00:16:47,201
Hit the road.

570
00:16:47,243 --> 00:16:49,620
But...

571
00:16:47,243 --> 00:16:49,620
Now!

572
00:16:49,661 --> 00:16:51,372
Can I get my stuff?

573
00:16:51,414 --> 00:16:54,375
Be quick about it!

574
00:16:51,414 --> 00:16:54,375
(whimpers)

575
00:17:00,089 --> 00:17:02,425
Hello.

576
00:17:00,089 --> 00:17:02,425
Hello.

577
00:17:02,466 --> 00:17:05,219
I brought you two hot dogs.

578
00:17:05,261 --> 00:17:06,887
A-Aren't you

579
00:17:05,261 --> 00:17:06,887
gonna eat one?

580
00:17:06,929 --> 00:17:09,432
From a street cart?

581
00:17:06,929 --> 00:17:09,432
Are you crazy?

582
00:17:09,473 --> 00:17:12,143
I'm amazed that

583
00:17:09,473 --> 00:17:12,143
I'm holding them.

584
00:17:12,184 --> 00:17:13,852
I'm not really hungry.

585
00:17:13,894 --> 00:17:18,774
You realize that I'm not

586
00:17:13,894 --> 00:17:18,774
a particularly physical person.

587
00:17:18,816 --> 00:17:22,111
I know.

588
00:17:18,816 --> 00:17:22,111
When I was little,

589
00:17:22,153 --> 00:17:24,780
and people asked me what

590
00:17:22,153 --> 00:17:24,780
I wanted to be when I grew up,

591
00:17:24,822 --> 00:17:28,033
I'd always say,

592
00:17:24,822 --> 00:17:28,033
"A brain in a jar."

593
00:17:28,075 --> 00:17:29,576
Sure.

594
00:17:29,618 --> 00:17:32,079
Yeah, but I want to be

595
00:17:29,618 --> 00:17:32,079
a good husband to you,

596
00:17:32,121 --> 00:17:36,041
and intimacy

597
00:17:32,121 --> 00:17:36,041
is a part of that.

598
00:17:36,083 --> 00:17:38,252
Please put those down.

599
00:17:38,294 --> 00:17:40,463
I'm just worried

600
00:17:38,294 --> 00:17:40,463
that if I don't schedule

601
00:17:40,504 --> 00:17:43,632
our bedroom endeavors,

602
00:17:40,504 --> 00:17:43,632
then I may not think about them,

603
00:17:43,674 --> 00:17:46,135
and you'll grow

604
00:17:43,674 --> 00:17:46,135
cold and distant

605
00:17:46,177 --> 00:17:50,389
and seek solace in the arms of

606
00:17:46,177 --> 00:17:50,389
a heavily-muscled longshoreman.

607
00:17:50,431 --> 00:17:53,225
Where would I find

608
00:17:50,431 --> 00:17:53,225
a longshoreman?

609
00:17:53,267 --> 00:17:55,353
Along the shore.

610
00:17:53,267 --> 00:17:55,353
It's in the name.

611
00:17:58,481 --> 00:18:02,067
Sheldon, I could never be

612
00:17:58,481 --> 00:18:02,067
with anybody but you.

613
00:18:02,109 --> 00:18:03,861
That's good to know.

614
00:18:03,902 --> 00:18:05,529
I wouldn't want

615
00:18:03,902 --> 00:18:05,529
to fight a man

616
00:18:05,570 --> 00:18:08,949
who's brave enough

617
00:18:05,570 --> 00:18:08,949
to touch a fish.

618
00:18:10,451 --> 00:18:13,037
How's this for

619
00:18:10,451 --> 00:18:13,037
a compromise?

620
00:18:13,078 --> 00:18:16,999
Make all the schedules you want,

621
00:18:13,078 --> 00:18:16,999
just don't tell me about them.

622
00:18:17,041 --> 00:18:18,709
Excellent.

623
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:20,919
I'll create an algorithm

624
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:20,919
that'll generate

625
00:18:20,961 --> 00:18:23,214
a pseudo-random schedule.

626
00:18:20,961 --> 00:18:23,214
Yeah, and do you know why

627
00:18:23,255 --> 00:18:25,341
it won't be a true

628
00:18:23,255 --> 00:18:25,341
random schedule?

629
00:18:25,383 --> 00:18:28,344
Because the generation

630
00:18:25,383 --> 00:18:28,344
of true random numbers

631
00:18:28,386 --> 00:18:31,055
remains an unsolved problem

632
00:18:28,386 --> 00:18:31,055
in computer science.

633
00:18:31,096 --> 00:18:32,306
Come with me.

634
00:18:32,348 --> 00:18:33,932
Where are we going?

635
00:18:32,348 --> 00:18:33,932
To the hotel room.

636
00:18:33,974 --> 00:18:35,600
And when we get there,

637
00:18:33,974 --> 00:18:35,600
I'm gonna need you

638
00:18:35,642 --> 00:18:38,312
to say that again,

639
00:18:35,642 --> 00:18:38,312
except naked.

640
00:18:35,642 --> 00:18:38,312
(gasps)

641
00:18:50,866 --> 00:18:51,867
(ringtone playing)

642
00:18:51,909 --> 00:18:54,870
Go for Dr. K.

643
00:18:54,912 --> 00:18:56,955
NEIL deGRASSE TYSON:

644
00:18:54,912 --> 00:18:56,955
Is this Rajesh Koothrappali?

645
00:18:56,997 --> 00:18:58,290
Yes. Who is this?

646
00:18:58,332 --> 00:19:01,043
Neil deGrasse Tyson.

647
00:19:03,003 --> 00:19:04,671
(stammers) Uh, w-wow.

648
00:19:04,713 --> 00:19:06,131
(chuckles)

649
00:19:06,173 --> 00:19:08,884
How fun is this

650
00:19:06,173 --> 00:19:08,884
Twitter thing, huh?

651
00:19:08,926 --> 00:19:10,761
You think you're funny?

652
00:19:10,802 --> 00:19:13,889
I'm-I'm not Seinfeld funny, but

653
00:19:10,802 --> 00:19:13,889
I did an open mic night once.

654
00:19:13,931 --> 00:19:15,558
You're not funny.

655
00:19:15,599 --> 00:19:18,352
Yeah, that's what they said

656
00:19:15,599 --> 00:19:18,352
at the Chuckle Hut.

657
00:19:18,394 --> 00:19:20,145
How about this:

658
00:19:20,187 --> 00:19:23,148
I've got a book signing at

659
00:19:20,187 --> 00:19:23,148
Vroman's in Pasadena next week.

660
00:19:23,190 --> 00:19:26,402
Why don't you come by and say

661
00:19:23,190 --> 00:19:26,402
some of those things to my face.

662
00:19:26,444 --> 00:19:28,446
(chuckles):

663
00:19:26,444 --> 00:19:28,446
Oh, no,

664
00:19:28,487 --> 00:19:31,282
but thanks for the invite.

665
00:19:31,323 --> 00:19:33,742
Smart move, and the next time

666
00:19:31,323 --> 00:19:33,742
you pick up your phone,

667
00:19:33,784 --> 00:19:38,581
remember, I'm the guy who kicked

668
00:19:33,784 --> 00:19:38,581
Pluto out of the solar system.

669
00:19:38,622 --> 00:19:40,832
And it deserved it, sir.

670
00:19:40,874 --> 00:19:43,127
Thank you. Bye-bye.

671
00:19:43,168 --> 00:19:47,131
Well, that was fun.

672
00:19:47,172 --> 00:19:50,468
Let's see who else needs

673
00:19:47,172 --> 00:19:50,468
a deGrasse kickin'.

674
00:19:54,513 --> 00:19:57,600
Bill Nye the Science Guy.

675
00:19:57,641 --> 00:20:01,186
Hey, Bill, Neil Tyson.

676
00:19:57,641 --> 00:20:01,186
We've got to talk.
