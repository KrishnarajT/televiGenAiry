1
00:00:05,658 --> 00:00:07,535
All right,

2
00:00:05,658 --> 00:00:07,535
Professor Proton fans,

3
00:00:07,577 --> 00:00:09,787
get ready to meet

4
00:00:07,577 --> 00:00:09,787
Dr. Sheldon Cooper

5
00:00:09,829 --> 00:00:13,416
and Dr. Amy Farrah Fowler,

6
00:00:09,829 --> 00:00:13,416
a pair of real-life scientists

7
00:00:13,457 --> 00:00:15,835
who may win the Nobel Prize.

8
00:00:15,877 --> 00:00:17,962
That's like

9
00:00:15,877 --> 00:00:17,962
the Kids' Choice Award,

10
00:00:18,004 --> 00:00:22,383
but with more science

11
00:00:18,004 --> 00:00:22,383
and less slime.

12
00:00:22,425 --> 00:00:23,927
Hi, thanks for having us.

13
00:00:23,968 --> 00:00:25,220
Kids' Choice Award?

14
00:00:25,302 --> 00:00:26,971
Why would they let kids

15
00:00:25,302 --> 00:00:26,971
choose anything?

16
00:00:27,013 --> 00:00:29,849
They're basically

17
00:00:27,013 --> 00:00:29,849
human larvae.

18
00:00:29,891 --> 00:00:32,685
Well, they are kind of

19
00:00:29,891 --> 00:00:32,685
our target audience.

20
00:00:36,231 --> 00:00:38,233
Greetings, children.

21
00:00:38,274 --> 00:00:40,777
Toys, am I right?

22
00:00:40,818 --> 00:00:43,863
He is. He has hundreds of them.

23
00:00:43,905 --> 00:00:45,448
So you two have

24
00:00:43,905 --> 00:00:45,448
discovered something

25
00:00:45,489 --> 00:00:47,867
that a lot of people

26
00:00:45,489 --> 00:00:47,867
are really excited about.

27
00:00:47,909 --> 00:00:49,284
(chuckles) We have.

28
00:00:49,326 --> 00:00:50,912
Now, before

29
00:00:49,326 --> 00:00:50,912
you explain it,

30
00:00:50,954 --> 00:00:54,540
keep in mind that our

31
00:00:50,954 --> 00:00:54,540
average viewer is this many.

32
00:00:54,582 --> 00:00:58,461
Okay, imagine you're

33
00:00:54,582 --> 00:00:58,461
looking in a mirror.

34
00:00:58,502 --> 00:01:01,047
The image you see

35
00:00:58,502 --> 00:01:01,047
looks just like you.

36
00:01:01,089 --> 00:01:03,133
That's called symmetrical.

37
00:01:03,174 --> 00:01:05,509
Now imagine you have

38
00:01:03,174 --> 00:01:05,509
a billion mirrors,

39
00:01:05,551 --> 00:01:08,554
and each of them reflects

40
00:01:05,551 --> 00:01:08,554
one thing about you correctly

41
00:01:08,596 --> 00:01:11,141
and a billion things

42
00:01:08,596 --> 00:01:11,141
about you incorrectly.

43
00:01:11,182 --> 00:01:13,476
And imagine the set

44
00:01:11,182 --> 00:01:13,476
of incorrect things

45
00:01:13,517 --> 00:01:16,980
are floating in an abstract

46
00:01:13,517 --> 00:01:16,980
n-dimensional hyperspace.

47
00:01:17,021 --> 00:01:21,109
Now imagine there was never

48
00:01:17,021 --> 00:01:21,109
a mirror to begin with.

49
00:01:22,526 --> 00:01:23,736
Oh, was that

50
00:01:22,526 --> 00:01:23,736
a doorbell?

51
00:01:23,778 --> 00:01:25,321
I didn't

52
00:01:23,778 --> 00:01:25,321
hear anything.

53
00:01:27,323 --> 00:01:29,075
(doorbell rings)

54
00:01:29,117 --> 00:01:31,326
Huh, there it is again.

55
00:01:31,368 --> 00:01:32,787
Sheldon, why don't

56
00:01:31,368 --> 00:01:32,787
you answer it?

57
00:01:32,829 --> 00:01:34,998
But I don't know who it is.

58
00:01:35,039 --> 00:01:39,002
Maybe it's a special guest who

59
00:01:35,039 --> 00:01:39,002
I invited just to surprise you.

60
00:01:39,043 --> 00:01:41,087
Why don't you open it up

61
00:01:39,043 --> 00:01:41,087
and find out.

62
00:01:41,129 --> 00:01:43,298
This is a terrible message

63
00:01:41,129 --> 00:01:43,298
to send to children.

64
00:01:43,338 --> 00:01:44,715
Children, you never

65
00:01:43,338 --> 00:01:44,715
open the door

66
00:01:44,757 --> 00:01:46,634
if you don't know

67
00:01:44,757 --> 00:01:46,634
who's on the other side.

68
00:01:46,676 --> 00:01:48,761
You always make your

69
00:01:46,676 --> 00:01:48,761
mommy or daddy do it

70
00:01:48,803 --> 00:01:51,014
while you hide under the bed

71
00:01:48,803 --> 00:01:51,014
and try to imagine

72
00:01:51,055 --> 00:01:54,142
what your superhero name will be

73
00:01:51,055 --> 00:01:54,142
when you avenge their deaths.

74
00:01:54,184 --> 00:01:56,853
I'll get it.

75
00:01:56,894 --> 00:01:59,272
But it can't be The Silver

76
00:01:56,894 --> 00:01:59,272
Shadow— that's mine.

77
00:02:01,607 --> 00:02:03,400
Hello.

78
00:02:05,278 --> 00:02:08,572
Captain on the bridge!

79
00:02:05,278 --> 00:02:08,572
Captain on the bridge!

80
00:02:09,699 --> 00:02:11,201
You're William Shatner.

81
00:02:11,242 --> 00:02:12,535
You can call me Bill.

82
00:02:12,576 --> 00:02:13,870
Ooh, can I call you Captain?

83
00:02:12,576 --> 00:02:13,870
No.

84
00:02:13,911 --> 00:02:15,872
Please?

85
00:02:13,911 --> 00:02:15,872
No.

86
00:02:15,913 --> 00:02:17,999
(whispers):

87
00:02:15,913 --> 00:02:17,999
Please?

88
00:02:18,041 --> 00:02:19,500
Sure.

89
00:02:20,835 --> 00:02:23,296
And w-will you call me

90
00:02:20,835 --> 00:02:23,296
Science Officer Cooper?

91
00:02:23,338 --> 00:02:25,089
This has got to stop.

92
00:02:25,131 --> 00:02:27,925
I think you know

93
00:02:25,131 --> 00:02:27,925
how to make it stop.

94
00:02:27,967 --> 00:02:30,678
Put her there,

95
00:02:27,967 --> 00:02:30,678
Science Officer Cooper.

96
00:02:32,847 --> 00:02:35,892
Put her there,

97
00:02:32,847 --> 00:02:35,892
Science Officer Cooper.

98
00:02:35,933 --> 00:02:39,436
(Sheldon vomits)

99
00:02:39,478 --> 00:02:41,772
Oh, poor Shatner.

100
00:02:41,814 --> 00:02:44,150
Poor Shatner?

101
00:02:41,814 --> 00:02:44,150
I have to eat lunch now.

102
00:02:44,192 --> 00:02:47,320
Look, Sheldon's

103
00:02:44,192 --> 00:02:47,320
pretty embarrassed,

104
00:02:47,362 --> 00:02:48,946
so when he gets here,

105
00:02:47,362 --> 00:02:48,946
we should...

106
00:02:48,988 --> 00:02:51,282
Make fun of him?

107
00:02:48,988 --> 00:02:51,282
(chuckles)

108
00:02:48,988 --> 00:02:51,282
A lot.

109
00:02:51,324 --> 00:02:53,117
Guys, don't you think

110
00:02:51,324 --> 00:02:53,117
that's a little mean?

111
00:02:53,159 --> 00:02:55,410
Yeah.

112
00:02:53,159 --> 00:02:55,410
Okay, just so we're

113
00:02:53,159 --> 00:02:55,410
all on the same page.

114
00:02:55,452 --> 00:02:56,579
Yeah.

115
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:57,955
Hello.

116
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:57,955
OTHERS:

117
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:57,955
Hey.

118
00:02:57,997 --> 00:02:59,790
So, Sheldon,

119
00:02:57,997 --> 00:02:59,790
did you get

120
00:02:59,832 --> 00:03:02,085
William Shatner's autograph,

121
00:02:59,832 --> 00:03:02,085
or maybe his dry cleaning bill?

122
00:03:02,126 --> 00:03:03,294
(chuckles)

123
00:03:03,336 --> 00:03:05,588
Very funny, get it all out.

124
00:03:05,629 --> 00:03:07,257
Like you did on William Shatner?

125
00:03:09,175 --> 00:03:11,177
Raj, do you have

126
00:03:09,175 --> 00:03:11,177
something to add?

127
00:03:11,219 --> 00:03:14,180
You brought shame upon

128
00:03:11,219 --> 00:03:14,180
yourself and your family.

129
00:03:14,222 --> 00:03:17,392
It's not funny,

130
00:03:14,222 --> 00:03:17,392
but it's true.

131
00:03:17,432 --> 00:03:20,186
I will admit the meeting

132
00:03:17,432 --> 00:03:20,186
did not go the way I wanted.

133
00:03:20,228 --> 00:03:23,564
(a la Shatner):

134
00:03:20,228 --> 00:03:23,564
Because you barfed where no man

135
00:03:20,228 --> 00:03:23,564
has barfed before?

136
00:03:24,982 --> 00:03:27,985
Well, the next time I meet him,

137
00:03:24,982 --> 00:03:27,985
it will go better.

138
00:03:28,027 --> 00:03:30,905
Next time? What makes you think

139
00:03:28,027 --> 00:03:30,905
there's gonna be a next time?

140
00:03:30,947 --> 00:03:33,991
Wil will give me another chance.

141
00:03:30,947 --> 00:03:33,991
He thinks the world of me.

142
00:03:34,033 --> 00:03:36,286
Aw. One of the reasons

143
00:03:34,033 --> 00:03:36,286
I love you

144
00:03:36,327 --> 00:03:38,996
is you actually believe that.

145
00:03:39,038 --> 00:03:41,124

For what?

170
00:04:29,464 --> 00:04:32,508
You.

171
00:04:32,549 --> 00:04:35,052
I need to apologize.

172
00:04:35,094 --> 00:04:37,180
Apology accepted.

173
00:04:35,094 --> 00:04:37,180

Wil, come on,

I cast fireball,

00:04:38,431 --> 00:04:39,890
you need to roll

your dexterity save.

178
00:04:39,932 --> 00:04:41,267
I'll be right there.

179
00:04:41,309 --> 00:04:43,560
Are you playing

180
00:04:41,309 --> 00:04:43,560
Dungeons & Dragons?

181
00:04:43,602 --> 00:04:45,146
No.

00:04:43,602 --> 00:04:45,146
MAN 2:

183
00:04:43,602 --> 00:04:45,146
Would you hurry up,

184
00:04:45,188 --> 00:04:47,190
man, the map says

185
00:04:45,188 --> 00:04:47,190
this dungeon's

186
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:49,942
full of dragons.

187
00:04:49,984 --> 00:04:53,321
Still no.

188
00:04:49,984 --> 00:04:53,321
Who are you playing with?

189
00:04:53,363 --> 00:04:55,781
Ugh... it's just some friends,

190
00:04:53,363 --> 00:04:55,781
you don't know them.

191
00:04:55,823 --> 00:04:57,033
SHATNER:

192
00:04:55,823 --> 00:04:57,033
Wheaton, get back here.

193
00:04:57,074 --> 00:04:58,617
Hobgoblins

194
00:04:57,074 --> 00:04:58,617
are at the gate,

195
00:04:58,659 --> 00:05:02,330
and you're at the door

196
00:04:58,659 --> 00:05:02,330
buying Girl Scout Cookies.

197
00:05:04,415 --> 00:05:06,417
Is that William Shat...?

198
00:05:04,415 --> 00:05:06,417
Nope.

199
00:05:10,296 --> 00:05:13,383
Hey, you guys want to read

200
00:05:10,296 --> 00:05:13,383
my fan fiction mash-up,

201
00:05:13,424 --> 00:05:15,134
"Captain Marvelous Mrs. Maisel"?

202
00:05:16,511 --> 00:05:18,513
Nope.

203
00:05:16,511 --> 00:05:18,513
No.

204
00:05:16,511 --> 00:05:18,513
Certainly not.

205
00:05:18,554 --> 00:05:20,097
You don't even know

206
00:05:18,554 --> 00:05:20,097
what it's about.

207
00:05:20,139 --> 00:05:21,516
Is it about

208
00:05:20,139 --> 00:05:21,516
a superhero

209
00:05:21,557 --> 00:05:23,226
who finds her voice

210
00:05:21,557 --> 00:05:23,226
by doing stand-up?

211
00:05:23,267 --> 00:05:26,521
That's so much better

212
00:05:23,267 --> 00:05:26,521
than what I had.

213
00:05:27,771 --> 00:05:30,400
Mine is just a Jewish girl

214
00:05:27,771 --> 00:05:30,400
that flies.

215
00:05:30,441 --> 00:05:33,319
I'd read that.

216
00:05:33,361 --> 00:05:35,612
Guys, guys,

217
00:05:33,361 --> 00:05:35,612
Wil Wheaton

218
00:05:35,654 --> 00:05:37,865
hosts a secret

219
00:05:35,654 --> 00:05:37,865
celebrity D&D game.

220
00:05:37,907 --> 00:05:39,283
How do you know?

221
00:05:37,907 --> 00:05:39,283
Who was there?

222
00:05:39,325 --> 00:05:40,910
Why are you damp?

223
00:05:40,951 --> 00:05:43,413
I was trying to peek

224
00:05:40,951 --> 00:05:43,413
in Wil's window,

225
00:05:43,454 --> 00:05:44,914
and he turned the sprinklers on.

226
00:05:44,955 --> 00:05:48,418
Oh, that means they

227
00:05:44,955 --> 00:05:48,418
must be really famous.

228
00:05:48,459 --> 00:05:50,378
I'm almost positive

229
00:05:48,459 --> 00:05:50,378
I heard William Shatner.

230
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:52,587
I wonder who else is playing.

231
00:05:52,629 --> 00:05:56,342
I-I bet we can use graph theory

232
00:05:52,629 --> 00:05:56,342
to determine who Wil knows

233
00:05:56,384 --> 00:05:58,677
and who is likely to play D&D.

234
00:05:56,384 --> 00:05:58,677
Yes.

235
00:05:58,719 --> 00:06:03,682
Okay, obviously he's connected

236
00:05:58,719 --> 00:06:03,682
to the whole Next Gen cast...

237
00:06:03,724 --> 00:06:07,019
So this is the rest

238
00:06:03,724 --> 00:06:07,019
of our night, huh?

239
00:06:07,061 --> 00:06:09,021
Oh, no,

240
00:06:09,063 --> 00:06:11,482
this is the rest of our lives.

241
00:06:12,942 --> 00:06:17,612
And Josh Brolin gets

242
00:06:12,942 --> 00:06:17,612
you to every Avenger.

243
00:06:17,654 --> 00:06:19,823
Kevin Smith's

244
00:06:17,654 --> 00:06:19,823
in this article

245
00:06:19,865 --> 00:06:21,200
about celebrities who play D&D.

246
00:06:21,242 --> 00:06:22,868
Oh! A-And he was

247
00:06:21,242 --> 00:06:22,868
on Wil's podcast,

248
00:06:22,910 --> 00:06:24,495
so they know each other.

249
00:06:24,537 --> 00:06:25,746
G-Go on his Instagram,

250
00:06:25,788 --> 00:06:27,123
see if you can find anything.

251
00:06:27,164 --> 00:06:28,916
Yeah, he-he posted something

252
00:06:27,164 --> 00:06:28,916
an hour ago:

253
00:06:28,958 --> 00:06:30,418
"#GameNight."

254
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:33,379
That looks like Wil's house.

255
00:06:33,421 --> 00:06:34,797
William Shatner,

256
00:06:34,838 --> 00:06:36,966
Kevin Smith—

257
00:06:34,838 --> 00:06:36,966
who else could be there?

258
00:06:37,007 --> 00:06:39,510
Do you see what I see

259
00:06:37,007 --> 00:06:39,510
over his shoulder?

260
00:06:39,552 --> 00:06:42,305
Is that a ghost?

261
00:06:43,389 --> 00:06:45,475
I think it's Stuart.

262
00:06:47,518 --> 00:06:51,021
That is Stuart.

263
00:06:47,518 --> 00:06:51,021
What-What's he doing there?

264
00:06:51,063 --> 00:06:52,982
Maybe he died in Wil's house

265
00:06:53,023 --> 00:06:55,859
and he can't leave

266
00:06:53,023 --> 00:06:55,859
until he solves his own murder.

267
00:06:57,652 --> 00:07:00,948
Why would Wil invite

268
00:06:57,652 --> 00:07:00,948
Stuart and not us?

269
00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:02,950
I know the answer.

270
00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:02,950
Yeah.

271
00:07:02,992 --> 00:07:04,952
We all know the answer.

272
00:07:19,216 --> 00:07:20,468
Hey, guys.

273
00:07:20,510 --> 00:07:23,053
You're home late.

274
00:07:23,095 --> 00:07:25,264
Uh, yeah.

275
00:07:25,306 --> 00:07:29,018
I had a crazy night.

276
00:07:25,306 --> 00:07:29,018
I went to the pharmacy.

277
00:07:29,059 --> 00:07:32,188
I like to be there when

278
00:07:29,059 --> 00:07:32,188
the new decongestants drop.

279
00:07:32,229 --> 00:07:34,190
Cut the crap.

280
00:07:32,229 --> 00:07:34,190
We know where you were.

281
00:07:34,231 --> 00:07:35,899
We know what

282
00:07:34,231 --> 00:07:35,899
you were doing.

283
00:07:35,941 --> 00:07:39,695
Yeah, I just told you. I was

284
00:07:35,941 --> 00:07:39,695
at CVS breathing my ass off.

285
00:07:39,736 --> 00:07:41,322
Oh, you were breathing,

286
00:07:39,736 --> 00:07:41,322
all right.

287
00:07:41,364 --> 00:07:43,115
You were breathing the

288
00:07:41,364 --> 00:07:43,115
rarefied air of celebrities.

289
00:07:43,157 --> 00:07:44,534
I don't know what

290
00:07:43,157 --> 00:07:44,534
you're talking about.

291
00:07:44,575 --> 00:07:45,742
Then why are

292
00:07:44,575 --> 00:07:45,742
you trembling?

293
00:07:45,784 --> 00:07:47,537
I'm always trembling.

294
00:07:47,578 --> 00:07:49,163
We know you were

295
00:07:47,578 --> 00:07:49,163
at Wil's D&D game.

296
00:07:49,205 --> 00:07:50,498
We saw you on Instagram.

297
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:52,458
We just want to know

298
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:52,458
how you got invited.

299
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:56,295
I can't talk about it or they

300
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:56,295
won't invite me back next week.

301
00:07:56,337 --> 00:07:58,088
So there's another

302
00:07:56,337 --> 00:07:58,088
game next week.

303
00:07:58,130 --> 00:07:59,965
I didn't mean to say that.

304
00:08:00,007 --> 00:08:01,967
Who's in it?

305
00:08:00,007 --> 00:08:01,967
I can't tell you!

306
00:08:02,009 --> 00:08:04,554
How do we get invited?

307
00:08:02,009 --> 00:08:04,554
I don't know!

308
00:08:04,595 --> 00:08:06,930
How many hit dice are they

309
00:08:04,595 --> 00:08:06,930
playing the wereboar as having?

310
00:08:06,972 --> 00:08:10,809
12d8 + 24—

311
00:08:06,972 --> 00:08:10,809
I mean, I don't know!

312
00:08:13,688 --> 00:08:15,731
(phone ringing)

313
00:08:16,691 --> 00:08:18,359
Hey, Stuart.

314
00:08:18,401 --> 00:08:20,570
I don't want to play anymore.

315
00:08:18,401 --> 00:08:20,570
It's too much pressure.

316
00:08:22,029 --> 00:08:24,448
Why, what happened?

317
00:08:22,029 --> 00:08:24,448
I've-I've said too much.

318
00:08:24,490 --> 00:08:26,075
You haven't said anything.

319
00:08:26,116 --> 00:08:29,370
Not to you, to them.

320
00:08:26,116 --> 00:08:29,370
Who's them?

321
00:08:29,412 --> 00:08:32,289
Ah! Now I have said too much!

322
00:08:35,042 --> 00:08:37,253
But y-you blocked

323
00:08:35,042 --> 00:08:37,253
your number, right?

324
00:08:37,294 --> 00:08:38,462
Relax,

325
00:08:38,504 --> 00:08:41,716
this is not my first

326
00:08:38,504 --> 00:08:41,716
creepy phone call.

327
00:08:41,757 --> 00:08:45,636
It's like riding a bike...

328
00:08:41,757 --> 00:08:45,636
slowly past a girl's house.

329
00:08:47,054 --> 00:08:48,305
WHEATON (over phone):

330
00:08:47,054 --> 00:08:48,305
Hello.

331
00:08:48,347 --> 00:08:49,557
(imitating Shatner):

332
00:08:48,347 --> 00:08:49,557
Wil,

333
00:08:49,599 --> 00:08:51,267
Bill Shatner here.

334
00:08:52,976 --> 00:08:55,854
Is this Howard?

335
00:08:55,896 --> 00:08:59,358
Of course not. It-It's Shatner.

336
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:02,986
If you don't believe me, ask my

337
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:02,986
good friend, Christopher Walken.

338
00:09:03,028 --> 00:09:05,864
(imitating Walken):

339
00:09:03,028 --> 00:09:05,864
Hello, Bill and I are just

340
00:09:05,906 --> 00:09:09,326
hanging out...

341
00:09:09,368 --> 00:09:11,245
at The Polo Lounge.

342
00:09:11,287 --> 00:09:14,624
Mr. Shatner, Mr. Walken,

343
00:09:11,287 --> 00:09:14,624
here are your martinis.

344
00:09:11,287 --> 00:09:14,624
(glass dings)

345
00:09:14,665 --> 00:09:16,208
(whispering in normal voice):

346
00:09:14,665 --> 00:09:16,208
What are you doing?

347
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:17,960
I'm filling out the world.

348
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:17,960
You're ruining it.

349
00:09:18,001 --> 00:09:19,670
No, he's not.

350
00:09:19,712 --> 00:09:22,590
Thanks, Wil.

351
00:09:29,513 --> 00:09:31,557
Sheldon, why are you walking

352
00:09:29,513 --> 00:09:31,557
everywhere? Just get a horse.

353
00:09:31,599 --> 00:09:34,893
I had a horse.

354
00:09:31,599 --> 00:09:34,893
It got hit by a train.

355
00:09:34,935 --> 00:09:36,145
Get another one.

356
00:09:36,186 --> 00:09:37,605
I can't just replace Chauncey.

357
00:09:37,647 --> 00:09:39,815
I'm still in the

358
00:09:37,647 --> 00:09:39,815
grieving process.

359
00:09:39,856 --> 00:09:42,318
(phone ringing)

360
00:09:42,359 --> 00:09:44,027
Hey.

361
00:09:44,069 --> 00:09:46,280
Hey, Leonard, I have an opening

362
00:09:44,069 --> 00:09:46,280
in my D&D game next week,

363
00:09:46,322 --> 00:09:48,491
and I was wondering if you

364
00:09:46,322 --> 00:09:48,491
were interested in playing.

365
00:09:48,532 --> 00:09:49,992
Well, yes, thank you.

366
00:09:50,033 --> 00:09:51,535
Okay, great.

367
00:09:51,577 --> 00:09:53,829
Now, here's the thing,

368
00:09:51,577 --> 00:09:53,829
you can't tell anyone.

369
00:09:53,870 --> 00:09:55,748
I'm serious,

370
00:09:53,870 --> 00:09:55,748
not Howard, not Raj,

371
00:09:55,790 --> 00:09:57,416
and certainly not Sheldon.

372
00:09:57,458 --> 00:09:58,751
Okay.

373
00:09:58,793 --> 00:10:00,127
I'm really sorry

374
00:09:58,793 --> 00:10:00,127
to put you in a position

375
00:10:00,169 --> 00:10:01,462
where you have to lie

376
00:10:00,169 --> 00:10:01,462
to your friends...

377
00:10:01,504 --> 00:10:03,297
See you there!

378
00:10:04,674 --> 00:10:07,217
You come face to face

379
00:10:04,674 --> 00:10:07,217
with a massive monster

380
00:10:07,259 --> 00:10:08,803
with a gaping maw

381
00:10:08,844 --> 00:10:13,808
full of teeth, three huge legs,

382
00:10:08,844 --> 00:10:13,808
and flailing tentacles.

383
00:10:13,849 --> 00:10:15,892
What do you do?

384
00:10:15,934 --> 00:10:19,396
Fellas, it looks like

385
00:10:15,934 --> 00:10:19,396
we're facing a, an otyugh.

386
00:10:20,815 --> 00:10:22,983
Here's the plan...

387
00:10:23,025 --> 00:10:25,194
Hold on there, Bill.

388
00:10:25,235 --> 00:10:26,821
Now what, Kareem?

389
00:10:28,113 --> 00:10:31,742
How do we know

390
00:10:28,113 --> 00:10:31,742
it's not a neo-otyugh?

391
00:10:31,784 --> 00:10:33,243
Same way I know

392
00:10:31,784 --> 00:10:33,243
the difference

393
00:10:33,285 --> 00:10:34,953
between an owlbear

394
00:10:33,285 --> 00:10:34,953
and a bugbear.

395
00:10:34,995 --> 00:10:36,913
Does that answer

396
00:10:34,995 --> 00:10:36,913
your question?

397
00:10:36,955 --> 00:10:39,416
No.

398
00:10:42,878 --> 00:10:44,421
Look, there's one way

399
00:10:42,878 --> 00:10:44,421
to settle this:

400
00:10:44,463 --> 00:10:46,048
we chop it up

401
00:10:44,463 --> 00:10:46,048
and look at the pieces.

402
00:10:46,089 --> 00:10:48,759
Oh, come on, why do you always

403
00:10:46,089 --> 00:10:48,759
got to attack everything?

404
00:10:48,801 --> 00:10:50,302
Why can't we just try

405
00:10:48,801 --> 00:10:50,302
talking to it?

406
00:10:50,344 --> 00:10:54,515
Big surprise, Podcast

407
00:10:50,344 --> 00:10:54,515
here wants to talk.

408
00:10:54,557 --> 00:10:56,684
What do you think, Leonard?

409
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:04,274
I think this is the greatest day

410
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:04,274
of my entire life.

411
00:11:04,316 --> 00:11:08,028
It's all right, buddy,

412
00:11:04,316 --> 00:11:08,028
one day you'll meet a girl.

413
00:11:13,826 --> 00:11:15,285
Hey, how was your lecture?

414
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:16,579
Oh, it was so good.

415
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:18,748
I-I-I mean, it-it started great,

416
00:11:18,789 --> 00:11:21,208
and then the, the middle

417
00:11:18,789 --> 00:11:21,208
was great,

418
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:22,626
and then the ending was like...

419
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:22,626
(imitates explosion)

420
00:11:22,668 --> 00:11:24,002
So great.

421
00:11:26,463 --> 00:11:29,842
Leonard, if you went to House

422
00:11:26,463 --> 00:11:29,842
of Pies again, just say it.

423
00:11:31,176 --> 00:11:32,469
(stammers)

424
00:11:31,176 --> 00:11:32,469
Wait, if you think I'm lying,

425
00:11:32,511 --> 00:11:34,096
why do you think

426
00:11:32,511 --> 00:11:34,096
I'm eating pies?

427
00:11:34,137 --> 00:11:36,515
Why don't you think I'm...

428
00:11:34,137 --> 00:11:36,515
having an affair?

429
00:11:36,557 --> 00:11:39,976
Listen, i-it's fine, just

430
00:11:36,557 --> 00:11:39,976
next time, bring me a slice.

431
00:11:40,018 --> 00:11:43,480
Okay, well, if you

432
00:11:40,018 --> 00:11:43,480
really want to know,

433
00:11:43,522 --> 00:11:45,190
I'll tell you where I was.

434
00:11:45,232 --> 00:11:47,984
I was at Wil's D&D game,

435
00:11:45,232 --> 00:11:47,984
but that's all I can say.

436
00:11:48,026 --> 00:11:50,529
Oh, fun.

437
00:11:48,026 --> 00:11:50,529
Were there famous people there?

438
00:11:50,571 --> 00:11:54,658
Ah, sorry, I-I-I can't

439
00:11:50,571 --> 00:11:54,658
tell you that.

440
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:56,452
Okay, well, yes,

441
00:11:56,493 --> 00:12:00,414
but I-I-I-I can't

442
00:11:56,493 --> 00:12:00,414
tell you who.

443
00:12:00,456 --> 00:12:02,416
Well, no, I-I can

444
00:12:00,456 --> 00:12:02,416
tell you Shatner,

445
00:12:02,458 --> 00:12:04,668
but that's only because

446
00:12:02,458 --> 00:12:04,668
you already knew that one.

447
00:12:04,710 --> 00:12:06,336
Well, I'm glad you had fun.

448
00:12:06,378 --> 00:12:07,838
Yeah.

449
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:10,173
Ugh, I wish I could tell you

450
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:10,173
who else was there.

451
00:12:10,215 --> 00:12:12,217
(chuckles)

452
00:12:10,215 --> 00:12:12,217
I can't, I promised.

453
00:12:12,259 --> 00:12:14,887
Yeah, if it makes you feel

454
00:12:12,259 --> 00:12:14,887
better, I couldn't care less.

455
00:12:14,929 --> 00:12:17,097
That's true,

456
00:12:17,139 --> 00:12:19,516
you don't care, so there's

457
00:12:17,139 --> 00:12:19,516
no harm in telling you.

458
00:12:19,558 --> 00:12:21,310
Okay, you really

459
00:12:19,558 --> 00:12:21,310
don't have to.

460
00:12:21,351 --> 00:12:23,938
All right,

461
00:12:21,351 --> 00:12:23,938
I'll tell you. Uh...

462
00:12:23,978 --> 00:12:25,689
(stammers)

463
00:12:23,978 --> 00:12:25,689
Kevin Smith was there,

464
00:12:25,731 --> 00:12:29,359
and-and, uh, this really

465
00:12:25,731 --> 00:12:29,359
tall guy named Kareem.

466
00:12:29,401 --> 00:12:32,321
Wait-wait,

467
00:12:29,401 --> 00:12:32,321
K-Kareem Abdul-Jabbar?

468
00:12:32,362 --> 00:12:35,741
I don't know, it was, uh,

469
00:12:32,362 --> 00:12:35,741
Kareem something Jabbar.

470
00:12:37,827 --> 00:12:39,411
How do you know him?

471
00:12:39,453 --> 00:12:40,871
How do you not know him?

472
00:12:40,913 --> 00:12:43,624
Well, I know him now

473
00:12:40,913 --> 00:12:43,624
'cause he was there.

474
00:12:43,666 --> 00:12:44,875
Wow.

475
00:12:44,917 --> 00:12:47,419
That is so cool.

476
00:12:47,461 --> 00:12:49,171
Oh, a-and that, uh,

477
00:12:47,461 --> 00:12:49,171
the guy that played

478
00:12:49,212 --> 00:12:50,547
the werewolf on-on True Blood,

479
00:12:50,589 --> 00:12:53,425
he was there.

480
00:12:50,589 --> 00:12:53,425
Wh— Joe Manganiello?

481
00:12:53,467 --> 00:12:57,972
Uh, yeah.

482
00:12:53,467 --> 00:12:57,972
From Magic Mike?

483
00:12:58,012 --> 00:13:00,724
What's that?

484
00:13:00,766 --> 00:13:02,852
Okay, okay,

485
00:13:02,893 --> 00:13:07,272
did he look... like this?

486
00:13:07,314 --> 00:13:10,108
He had his clothes on,

487
00:13:07,314 --> 00:13:10,108
but, yeah.

488
00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:11,485
(sighs)

489
00:13:11,527 --> 00:13:13,111
I can't believe you

490
00:13:11,527 --> 00:13:13,111
met Joe Manganiello.

491
00:13:13,153 --> 00:13:14,488
Is he nice?

492
00:13:13,153 --> 00:13:14,488
Oh, he's so nice.

493
00:13:14,530 --> 00:13:17,533
I-I-I rolled my dice

494
00:13:14,530 --> 00:13:17,533
underneath the couch,

495
00:13:17,574 --> 00:13:20,911
and he just lifted

496
00:13:17,574 --> 00:13:20,911
it up, one hand.

497
00:13:20,953 --> 00:13:23,956
Oh, I-I bet he did.

498
00:13:26,333 --> 00:13:28,418
Hi. Okay, can you guys

499
00:13:26,333 --> 00:13:28,418
keep a secret?

500
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:29,670
Yeah.

501
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:29,670
Sure.

502
00:13:29,712 --> 00:13:32,172
Good, 'cause I can't.

503
00:13:32,214 --> 00:13:34,341
Leonard played

504
00:13:32,214 --> 00:13:34,341
Dungeons & Dragons

505
00:13:34,383 --> 00:13:35,759
with the hot guy

506
00:13:34,383 --> 00:13:35,759
from Magic Mike.

507
00:13:35,801 --> 00:13:39,429
I never got to see that movie.

508
00:13:35,801 --> 00:13:39,429
Seriously?

509
00:13:39,471 --> 00:13:40,890
Yeah, Howie made us leave

510
00:13:40,931 --> 00:13:43,141
as soon as he realized

511
00:13:40,931 --> 00:13:43,141
it wasn't about magic.

512
00:13:44,601 --> 00:13:47,688
Well, I have seen that movie

513
00:13:44,601 --> 00:13:47,688
one or seven times,

514
00:13:47,730 --> 00:13:49,815
and trust me, it is magic.

515
00:13:51,483 --> 00:13:53,861
Which guy?

516
00:13:51,483 --> 00:13:53,861
That one.

517
00:13:53,903 --> 00:13:56,530
Abracadabra.

518
00:13:58,490 --> 00:14:01,075
Hey, you know what was fun?

519
00:14:01,117 --> 00:14:03,954
That time we played

520
00:14:01,117 --> 00:14:03,954
Dungeons & Dragons.

521
00:14:03,996 --> 00:14:08,250
That was fun.

522
00:14:03,996 --> 00:14:08,250
We should play that more.

523
00:14:10,252 --> 00:14:12,504
Sorry, what now?

524
00:14:18,092 --> 00:14:19,636
Hey, what are you guys

525
00:14:18,092 --> 00:14:19,636
doing here?

526
00:14:19,678 --> 00:14:22,222
Oh, I, uh, think Sheldon

527
00:14:19,678 --> 00:14:22,222
might have left something.

528
00:14:22,264 --> 00:14:24,391
Oh, you mean, besides his lunch?

529
00:14:24,433 --> 00:14:26,226
(laughter)

530
00:14:27,686 --> 00:14:30,272
You are so funny, Wil.

531
00:14:30,313 --> 00:14:33,483
We were just talking

532
00:14:30,313 --> 00:14:33,483
about how funny you are.

533
00:14:33,525 --> 00:14:35,235
Yeah, Leonard told you,

534
00:14:33,525 --> 00:14:35,235
didn't he?

535
00:14:35,277 --> 00:14:36,779
Yeah. Mm-hmm.

536
00:14:35,277 --> 00:14:36,779
Yup.

537
00:14:35,277 --> 00:14:36,779
Yeah.

538
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:38,405
It's Manganiello?

539
00:14:38,447 --> 00:14:40,115
Uh-huh.

540
00:14:38,447 --> 00:14:40,115
Mm-hmm.

541
00:14:38,447 --> 00:14:40,115
Mm-hmm.

542
00:14:40,156 --> 00:14:41,283
Feel good about yourselves?

543
00:14:41,324 --> 00:14:43,535
Nope.

544
00:14:41,324 --> 00:14:43,535
No.

545
00:14:41,324 --> 00:14:43,535
Yeah.

546
00:14:45,704 --> 00:14:48,498
Oh, we're going

547
00:14:45,704 --> 00:14:48,498
with no? No.

548
00:14:50,667 --> 00:14:53,336
Hey, guys.

549
00:14:53,378 --> 00:14:55,130
What are you

550
00:14:53,378 --> 00:14:55,130
smiling about?

551
00:14:55,171 --> 00:14:57,424
What? This is my regular face.

552
00:14:57,466 --> 00:14:59,342
No, it's not.

553
00:14:59,384 --> 00:15:02,471
Y-Your regular face

554
00:14:59,384 --> 00:15:02,471
is more like this...

555
00:15:04,306 --> 00:15:09,311
No, no, i-it's-it's more

556
00:15:04,306 --> 00:15:09,311
in the eyebrows, like this...

557
00:15:11,939 --> 00:15:14,775
(chuckles)

558
00:15:11,939 --> 00:15:14,775
Okay, make your jokes.

559
00:15:14,817 --> 00:15:16,276
I'm still in a great mood.

560
00:15:16,318 --> 00:15:18,779
(phone ringing)

561
00:15:18,821 --> 00:15:21,448
Hey.

562
00:15:21,490 --> 00:15:22,992
Wait, what?

563
00:15:24,034 --> 00:15:26,787
Why?

564
00:15:26,829 --> 00:15:29,665
Oh, come on, but...

565
00:15:30,624 --> 00:15:34,294
O-Okay, fine.

566
00:15:34,336 --> 00:15:37,464
Huh, Raj was right,

567
00:15:34,336 --> 00:15:37,464
it is more in the eyebrows.

568
00:15:38,632 --> 00:15:39,883
What was that all about?

569
00:15:39,925 --> 00:15:41,927
Wil kicked me out

570
00:15:39,925 --> 00:15:41,927
of his D&D game.

571
00:15:43,219 --> 00:15:45,263
You were

572
00:15:43,219 --> 00:15:45,263
in Wil's D&D game?

573
00:15:45,305 --> 00:15:47,099
With William Shatner?

574
00:15:45,305 --> 00:15:47,099
And you didn't tell us?

575
00:15:47,141 --> 00:15:49,977
I'm sorry,

576
00:15:47,141 --> 00:15:49,977
Wil made me promise not to.

577
00:15:50,019 --> 00:15:51,603
I thought

578
00:15:50,019 --> 00:15:51,603
we were friends.

579
00:15:51,645 --> 00:15:53,939
Oh, come on, you guys

580
00:15:51,645 --> 00:15:53,939
would do the same thing.

581
00:15:53,981 --> 00:15:55,565
No, we wouldn't!

582
00:15:53,981 --> 00:15:55,565
I told you when I was

583
00:15:55,607 --> 00:15:57,275
in spin class with

584
00:15:55,607 --> 00:15:57,275
Scarlett Johansson.

585
00:15:57,317 --> 00:15:59,277
It didn't even turn out

586
00:15:57,317 --> 00:15:59,277
to be Scarlett Johansson.

587
00:15:59,319 --> 00:16:02,072
Well, that's her

588
00:15:59,319 --> 00:16:02,072
fault, not mine!

589
00:16:02,114 --> 00:16:03,615
It doesn't matter

590
00:16:03,657 --> 00:16:06,702
because Penny blabbed about it

591
00:16:03,657 --> 00:16:06,702
and now I'm out.

592
00:16:08,078 --> 00:16:10,747
So there's an open seat.

593
00:16:11,915 --> 00:16:13,542
Wil!

594
00:16:11,915 --> 00:16:13,542
Wil Wheaton!

595
00:16:13,583 --> 00:16:15,669
Open! Open!

596
00:16:17,129 --> 00:16:19,214
No. No. No.

597
00:16:19,255 --> 00:16:20,799
Hell no.

598
00:16:20,841 --> 00:16:24,302
Look, we know Leonard is out.

599
00:16:20,841 --> 00:16:24,302
You need to fill a seat.

600
00:16:24,344 --> 00:16:26,555
It should be one of us.

601
00:16:26,596 --> 00:16:28,264
Or give me another chance.

602
00:16:28,306 --> 00:16:30,767
I think me and Joe Manganiello

603
00:16:28,306 --> 00:16:30,767
were really hitting it off.

604
00:16:30,809 --> 00:16:33,854
Joe Manganiello was there?

605
00:16:30,809 --> 00:16:33,854
From Magic Mike?

606
00:16:33,896 --> 00:16:36,481
You guys suck.

607
00:16:36,523 --> 00:16:38,608
Agreed. You guys suck.

608
00:16:36,523 --> 00:16:38,608
Let's go, Wil.

609
00:16:38,650 --> 00:16:40,318
No.

610
00:16:41,195 --> 00:16:42,905
All of you.

611
00:16:42,946 --> 00:16:44,740
You're just

612
00:16:42,946 --> 00:16:44,740
trying to use me

613
00:16:44,781 --> 00:16:46,616
to get close

614
00:16:44,781 --> 00:16:46,616
to my famous friends.

615
00:16:46,658 --> 00:16:48,326
Do you know how

616
00:16:46,658 --> 00:16:48,326
that makes me feel?

617
00:16:48,368 --> 00:16:50,620
Flattered? (chuckles)

618
00:16:50,662 --> 00:16:52,497
Used.

619
00:16:52,539 --> 00:16:55,792
I was gonna

620
00:16:52,539 --> 00:16:55,792
guess that.

621
00:16:55,834 --> 00:16:57,836
One of the worst things

622
00:16:55,834 --> 00:16:57,836
about being a celebrity

623
00:16:57,878 --> 00:17:01,297
is you never know if people

624
00:16:57,878 --> 00:17:01,297
like you for you.

625
00:17:01,339 --> 00:17:04,718
Well, thanks

626
00:17:01,339 --> 00:17:04,718
for letting me know.

627
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:06,178
(sighs)

628
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:08,847
You're right, that was

629
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:08,847
really crappy of us.

630
00:17:08,889 --> 00:17:12,642
Yeah, I guess we just got

631
00:17:08,889 --> 00:17:12,642
caught up in the excitement.

632
00:17:12,684 --> 00:17:15,395
We're sorry, Wil.

633
00:17:12,684 --> 00:17:15,395
We do like you for you.

634
00:17:15,437 --> 00:17:17,231
And if it makes

635
00:17:15,437 --> 00:17:17,231
you feel

636
00:17:17,272 --> 00:17:19,608
any better, I don't even really

637
00:17:17,272 --> 00:17:19,608
consider you a celebrity.

638
00:17:25,072 --> 00:17:27,741
Should we go or do you want

639
00:17:25,072 --> 00:17:27,741
to wait for the sprinklers?

640
00:17:32,037 --> 00:17:33,747
Guys, I-I still feel

641
00:17:32,037 --> 00:17:33,747
a little bad about Wil.

642
00:17:33,789 --> 00:17:35,249
Me, too.

643
00:17:35,290 --> 00:17:38,627
Yeah. We should invite him

644
00:17:35,290 --> 00:17:38,627
to come play with us.

645
00:17:38,668 --> 00:17:40,796
Ask him to bring

646
00:17:38,668 --> 00:17:40,796
some chips

647
00:17:40,837 --> 00:17:42,338
because we're all out.

648
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:44,424
(stammers)

649
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:44,424
Hey, Wil, this is Leonard.

650
00:17:44,466 --> 00:17:45,634
(gasps)

651
00:17:44,466 --> 00:17:45,634
Make it Bugles.

652
00:17:45,675 --> 00:17:47,219
No, no, no, no, no,

653
00:17:45,675 --> 00:17:47,219
pretzel sticks.

654
00:17:47,261 --> 00:17:48,845
No, no, no, Bugles.

655
00:17:49,846 --> 00:17:51,640
We're gonna play some D&D

656
00:17:51,681 --> 00:17:53,058
and thought you might

657
00:17:51,681 --> 00:17:53,058
want to join us.

658
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:54,226
Thank you, Leonard, but actually

659
00:17:54,268 --> 00:17:55,936
I can't do it tonight.

660
00:17:55,978 --> 00:17:57,938
Uh, how about another time?

661
00:17:57,980 --> 00:18:00,774
Okay, great. Thanks. Bye.

662
00:18:00,816 --> 00:18:02,901
Okay, where were we?

663
00:18:06,071 --> 00:18:10,117
I was about to go all

664
00:18:06,071 --> 00:18:10,117
Wrath of Khan on the ogres.

665
00:18:10,159 --> 00:18:11,785
Oh, man, that's it.

666
00:18:11,827 --> 00:18:14,663
Put another dollar

667
00:18:11,827 --> 00:18:14,663
in the Star Trek jar, Bill.

668
00:18:14,704 --> 00:18:17,332
Worth it.

669
00:18:18,583 --> 00:18:22,879
Speaking of putting

670
00:18:18,583 --> 00:18:22,879
dollars in things...

671
00:18:25,757 --> 00:18:28,218
I loved you

672
00:18:25,757 --> 00:18:28,218
in Magic Mike.

673
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:30,345
(chuckles)

674
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:30,345
Thanks. (chuckles)

675
00:18:30,386 --> 00:18:32,055
Switch places with me.

676
00:18:34,141 --> 00:18:37,519
Are we playing musical chairs

677
00:18:34,141 --> 00:18:37,519
or Dungeons & Dragons?

678
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:41,064
Yeah, let's teach that ogre

679
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:41,064
what my broadsword tastes like.

680
00:18:41,106 --> 00:18:44,318
I like your moxie.

681
00:18:44,359 --> 00:18:47,403
Aw, and I like

682
00:18:44,359 --> 00:18:47,403
your grandpa words.

683
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:56,579
My dad and I watched you win

684
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:56,579
back-to-back championships.

685
00:18:56,621 --> 00:19:01,043
And I watched you sniff Joe's

686
00:18:56,621 --> 00:19:01,043
hair when he wasn't looking.

687
00:19:04,921 --> 00:19:07,299
Thank you again for inviting us,

688
00:19:04,921 --> 00:19:07,299
and don't worry,

689
00:19:07,341 --> 00:19:08,758
we won't tell the guys.

690
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:11,220
You know what, why don't

691
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:11,220
you tell the guys?

692
00:19:11,261 --> 00:19:13,138
In fact, let's all

693
00:19:11,261 --> 00:19:13,138
take a picture

694
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:14,890
and send it to

695
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:14,890
them right now.

696
00:19:16,683 --> 00:19:20,312
(phones buzzing)

697
00:19:20,354 --> 00:19:22,272
That's weird.

698
00:19:26,902 --> 00:19:29,279
We deserve that.
