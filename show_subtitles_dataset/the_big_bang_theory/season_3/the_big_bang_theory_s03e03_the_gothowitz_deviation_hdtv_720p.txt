1
00:00:21,842 --> 00:00:24,191
Good morning.
Come dance with me.

2
00:00:28,945 --> 00:00:30,142
Why not?

3
00:00:31,282 --> 00:00:33,862
While I subscribe
to the many worlds theory

4
00:00:33,987 --> 00:00:38,133
which poses the existence of an infinite
number of Sheldons and universes,

5
00:00:38,258 --> 00:00:41,023
I assure you that none of them
am I dancing.

6
00:00:42,512 --> 00:00:44,478
Are you fun in any of them?

7
00:00:45,946 --> 00:00:49,139
The math would suggest
that in a few I'm a clown made of candy.

8
00:00:51,711 --> 00:00:53,218
But I don't dance.

9
00:00:53,885 --> 00:00:55,262
Want some French toast?

10
00:00:55,431 --> 00:00:56,638
It's oatmeal day.

11
00:00:58,343 --> 00:01:01,101
Tell you what, next French toast day,
I'll make you oatmeal.

12
00:01:01,544 --> 00:01:04,654
Dear Lord, are you still going
to be here on French toast day?

13
00:01:09,357 --> 00:01:10,467
Morning.

14
00:01:11,638 --> 00:01:13,155
Penny made French toast.

15
00:01:13,325 --> 00:01:15,557
Sorry I haven't given her
your schedule yet.

16
00:01:15,744 --> 00:01:17,160
It's an iCal download.

17
00:01:17,285 --> 00:01:18,910
She can put it right in her phone.

18
00:01:20,467 --> 00:01:23,248
And I thought we agreed that you'd have
your conjugal visits in her apartment.

19
00:01:23,904 --> 00:01:26,554
We did, but there were
extenuating circumstances.

20
00:01:26,679 --> 00:01:27,467
I see.

21
00:01:27,592 --> 00:01:30,464
Did her abysmal housekeeping skills
finally trump her perkiness?

22
00:01:32,788 --> 00:01:35,011
No, her bed kind of... broke.

23
00:01:37,816 --> 00:01:39,056
That doesn't seem likely.

24
00:01:39,298 --> 00:01:41,098
Her bed's of sturdy construction.

25
00:01:42,153 --> 00:01:45,593
Even the addition of a 2nd normal size
human being wouldn't cause a failure.

26
00:01:45,718 --> 00:01:47,606
Much less a homunculus
such as yourself.

27
00:01:49,592 --> 00:01:50,776
A homunculus?

28
00:01:50,945 --> 00:01:53,139
Perfectly formed
miniature human being.

29
00:01:55,763 --> 00:01:58,313
You're my little homunculus.

30
00:01:59,468 --> 00:02:01,278
- Don't do that.
- Sorry.

31
00:02:01,403 --> 00:02:03,247
Who wants syrup
and who wants cinnamon sugar?

32
00:02:03,415 --> 00:02:04,641
I want oatmeal.

33
00:02:05,627 --> 00:02:08,541
I want a boyfriend whose roommate
isn't a giant pain in the ass.

34
00:02:09,297 --> 00:02:10,925
I'm sure
that will happen soon enough.

35
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:14,935
But in the meantime,
I still want oatmeal.

36
00:02:16,054 --> 00:02:17,954
You know what, I give up.
He's impossible.

37
00:02:18,079 --> 00:02:20,479
I can't be impossible. I exist.

38
00:02:21,308 --> 00:02:24,532
I believe what you meant to say is,
"I give up, he's improbable."

39
00:02:31,403 --> 00:02:34,341
You really need to find a better way
of dealing with Penny.

40
00:02:34,466 --> 00:02:37,591
What am I supposed to do...
eat French toast on a Monday?

41
00:02:37,716 --> 00:02:39,351
Now, that would be impossible.

42
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:43,537
I'm just saying, you can catch
more flies with honey than with vinegar.

43
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:46,999
You can catch more flies with manure.
What's your point?

44
00:02:48,152 --> 00:02:48,997
It's a...

45
00:02:53,362 --> 00:02:55,042
Boy, that does smell good.

46
00:02:56,092 --> 00:02:57,592
Too bad it's Monday.

47
00:03:00,555 --> 00:03:02,724
Episode 303: The Gothowitz Deviation

48
00:03:03,225 --> 00:03:05,274
Sync: Jess, Linwelin, Loky

49
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:22,154
www.subbercafe.fr

50
00:03:25,723 --> 00:03:28,032
So Kim the night manager
went on maternity leave,

51
00:03:28,157 --> 00:03:29,751
And her husband's name is Sandy.

52
00:03:30,032 --> 00:03:31,002
So get this...

53
00:03:31,171 --> 00:03:33,512
Her replacement
is a woman named Sandy

54
00:03:33,637 --> 00:03:35,370
whose husband's name is Kim.

55
00:03:40,137 --> 00:03:41,096
I know.

56
00:03:41,532 --> 00:03:42,889
What are the odds?

57
00:03:43,197 --> 00:03:44,221
Easily calculable.

58
00:03:44,346 --> 00:03:46,596
We begin by identifying
a set of married couples

59
00:03:46,721 --> 00:03:47,754
with unisex names.

60
00:03:47,879 --> 00:03:49,959
We eliminate those unqualified
for restaurant work...

61
00:03:50,084 --> 00:03:52,622
The aged, the imprisoned
and the limbless, for example.

62
00:03:52,747 --> 00:03:54,322
Next we look at the...

63
00:03:55,158 --> 00:03:57,737
It's an amazing coincidence.
Can we leave it at that?

64
00:03:59,594 --> 00:04:00,594
I'm sorry.

65
00:04:02,644 --> 00:04:05,719
It's as if the Cheesecake Factory
is run by witches.

66
00:04:09,718 --> 00:04:11,893
It's as if
you don't think I'll punch you.

67
00:04:14,203 --> 00:04:15,880
Come on, you guys, let it go.

68
00:04:16,049 --> 00:04:17,094
Fine, whatever.

69
00:04:18,165 --> 00:04:19,395
Are you finished?

70
00:04:20,285 --> 00:04:21,220
Thank you.

71
00:04:21,405 --> 00:04:22,595
How thoughtful.

72
00:04:23,264 --> 00:04:24,931
Would you like a chocolate?

73
00:04:26,058 --> 00:04:27,158
Yeah, sure.

74
00:04:30,355 --> 00:04:31,225
Thanks.

75
00:04:34,275 --> 00:04:35,345
What was that?

76
00:04:37,103 --> 00:04:38,783
You said be nice to Penny.

77
00:04:38,908 --> 00:04:42,335
I believe offering chocolate to someone
falls within the definition of nice.

78
00:04:43,345 --> 00:04:46,548
It does.
But in my experience, you don't.

79
00:04:48,348 --> 00:04:50,718
There are more things in heaven
and earth, Horatio,

80
00:04:50,843 --> 00:04:52,500
Than are dreamt of
in your philosophy

81
00:04:53,029 --> 00:04:54,284
Now that's you.

82
00:04:54,409 --> 00:04:55,988
Obnoxious and insufferable.

83
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:04,845
What's going on, day dwellers?

84
00:05:06,187 --> 00:05:09,727
Oh, man, did the Kiss Army
repeal "don't ask, don't tell"?

85
00:05:11,965 --> 00:05:15,231
Raj and I are going
to a goth club in Hollywood

86
00:05:15,356 --> 00:05:16,991
to hang with the night people.

87
00:05:18,611 --> 00:05:22,220
- Anybody want to come along?
- You're actually going out like that?

88
00:05:23,757 --> 00:05:25,362
I'm going out like this...

89
00:05:28,803 --> 00:05:29,788
What did you do?

90
00:05:29,998 --> 00:05:32,415
They're called tattoo sleeves.
Look.

91
00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:35,710
I got them online.
Raj got a set, too...

92
00:05:39,498 --> 00:05:40,983
Fantastic, right?

93
00:05:41,108 --> 00:05:44,072
Put them on, have hot sex with some
freaky girl with her business pierced,

94
00:05:44,197 --> 00:05:47,096
take them off, and I can still be buried
in a Jewish cemetery.

95
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:51,726
You know, I've always wanted
to go to a goth nightclub.

96
00:05:51,971 --> 00:05:53,423
- Really?
- Bazinga!

97
00:05:56,105 --> 00:05:58,870
None of you ever see
my practical jokes coming, do you?

98
00:05:59,949 --> 00:06:03,244
Okay, how about you two?
Look, I've got some extra tat sleeves.

99
00:06:04,705 --> 00:06:06,156
Why are you carrying extras?

100
00:06:06,326 --> 00:06:08,723
In case I snag one on
someone's nipple ring.

101
00:06:10,646 --> 00:06:11,746
I think we'll pass.

102
00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:16,130
Is the missus speaking
for the couple now?

103
00:06:17,587 --> 00:06:19,132
In this case, you bet she is.

104
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:24,531
Yes, she's pushy,
and yes, he's whipped,

105
00:06:24,656 --> 00:06:26,406
but that's not the expression.

106
00:06:30,721 --> 00:06:33,895
Come on, I want to stop at Walgreen's
and pick up some more eyeliner.

107
00:06:39,178 --> 00:06:41,524
They're gonna get beaten up
at that club.

108
00:06:42,373 --> 00:06:44,473
They're gonna get beaten up
at Walgreen's.

109
00:06:48,690 --> 00:06:50,700
Sorry, Sheldon.
I almost sat in your spot.

110
00:06:51,246 --> 00:06:53,519
Did you? I didn't notice.

111
00:06:53,915 --> 00:06:55,068
Have a chocolate.

112
00:06:57,260 --> 00:06:58,321
Thank you.

113
00:07:11,409 --> 00:07:13,391
I think we're fitting in
quite nicely.

114
00:07:15,698 --> 00:07:18,396
It'd help if you weren't
drinking light beer.

115
00:07:18,948 --> 00:07:21,606
What's so gothic
about vodka and cranberry juice?

116
00:07:21,995 --> 00:07:24,234
Hello? It looks like blood.

117
00:07:24,509 --> 00:07:27,612
Did you even read the "wiki how" link
I sent you on being goth?

118
00:07:28,355 --> 00:07:30,449
No, I'm behind on my wiki-reading.

119
00:07:30,574 --> 00:07:33,285
I'm kind of on a John Grisham
kick right now.

120
00:07:33,797 --> 00:07:34,579
What?

121
00:07:34,747 --> 00:07:36,960
I finished reading <i>The Pelican Brief</i>
and loved it so much,

122
00:07:37,085 --> 00:07:38,887
I dived right into <i>The Client.</i>

123
00:07:39,012 --> 00:07:42,737
He was a lawyer himself, so his novels
are accurate as well as entertaining.

124
00:07:44,323 --> 00:07:47,237
Just remember we are lost boys,

125
00:07:47,362 --> 00:07:49,093
children of the night.

126
00:07:49,387 --> 00:07:52,813
Great. Lost boys.
Children of the night. Got it.

127
00:07:53,948 --> 00:07:56,090
Can you pass the chex mix please?

128
00:07:58,062 --> 00:07:59,124
Thank you.

129
00:08:02,885 --> 00:08:04,240
We are lost boys.

130
00:08:07,197 --> 00:08:08,361
Good for you.

131
00:08:08,531 --> 00:08:11,496
I'm actually much more lost
than he is.

132
00:08:13,762 --> 00:08:14,702
Nice ink.

133
00:08:15,715 --> 00:08:18,331
Thanks.
Can we buy you ladies a drink?

134
00:08:19,779 --> 00:08:20,790
Two light beers.

135
00:08:21,342 --> 00:08:23,946
Light beers.
Well, wiki-how about that?

136
00:08:25,788 --> 00:08:27,590
- What's your names?
- I'm Howard.

137
00:08:27,715 --> 00:08:29,146
- Raj.
- I'm Bethany.

138
00:08:29,489 --> 00:08:31,761
- Nice to meet you, Bethany.
- Yes, very nice.

139
00:08:31,929 --> 00:08:33,398
Nice to meet you, too.

140
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:34,903
I'm Sarah.

141
00:08:35,028 --> 00:08:36,686
Not that anyone cares.

142
00:08:40,605 --> 00:08:44,023
Do either of you ladies enjoy
the novels of John Grisham?

143
00:08:53,779 --> 00:08:55,492
What's this cartoon called again?

144
00:08:55,779 --> 00:08:57,751
<i>Oshikuru: Demon Samurai.</i>

145
00:08:59,629 --> 00:09:00,903
It's not a cartoon.

146
00:09:01,028 --> 00:09:02,247
It's anime.

147
00:09:03,659 --> 00:09:04,671
Anime.

148
00:09:05,095 --> 00:09:07,253
I knew a girl in high school
named Anna May.

149
00:09:08,329 --> 00:09:09,930
Anna May Fletcher.

150
00:09:11,495 --> 00:09:13,526
She was born with one nostril.

151
00:09:14,039 --> 00:09:17,400
Then she had this bad nose job
and basically wound up with three.

152
00:09:23,218 --> 00:09:24,713
You're here a lot now.

153
00:09:27,043 --> 00:09:29,392
Am I talking too much?
I'm sorry. Zip.

154
00:09:29,685 --> 00:09:30,611
Thank you.

155
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:32,405
Chocolate?

156
00:09:33,336 --> 00:09:34,438
Yes, please.

157
00:09:41,912 --> 00:09:42,707
Hey, Kim.

158
00:09:45,244 --> 00:09:47,837
You know what, hold on.
Let me take this in the hall.

159
00:09:55,338 --> 00:09:58,144
You'll never guess
who they got to replace you at work.

160
00:10:03,197 --> 00:10:05,562
- I know what you're doing.
- Really?

161
00:10:05,774 --> 00:10:08,815
Yes, you're using chocolates
as positive reinforcement

162
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:11,402
for what you consider
correct behavior.

163
00:10:14,409 --> 00:10:15,580
Very good.

164
00:10:17,368 --> 00:10:19,764
- Chocolate?
- No, I don't want any chocolate!

165
00:10:24,826 --> 00:10:28,012
You can't train my girlfriend
like a lab rat.

166
00:10:29,350 --> 00:10:31,256
Actually, it turns out I can.

167
00:10:32,547 --> 00:10:34,592
Well, you shouldn't.

168
00:10:34,906 --> 00:10:36,761
There's just no pleasing you,
is there?

169
00:10:36,929 --> 00:10:37,970
You weren't happy

170
00:10:38,138 --> 00:10:39,720
with my previous approach,

171
00:10:39,845 --> 00:10:42,725
so I decided to employ operant
conditioning techniques,

172
00:10:42,893 --> 00:10:44,934
building on the works
of Thorndike and Skinner.

173
00:10:45,223 --> 00:10:46,519
By this time next week,

174
00:10:46,690 --> 00:10:48,684
I believe I can have her
jumping out of a pool,

175
00:10:48,809 --> 00:10:50,937
balancing a beach ball on her nose.

176
00:10:52,539 --> 00:10:55,111
No, this has to stop now.

177
00:10:55,282 --> 00:10:58,770
I'm not suggesting we really
make her jump out of a pool.

178
00:10:59,568 --> 00:11:01,242
I thought the "bazinga" was implied.

179
00:11:02,627 --> 00:11:04,473
We're just tweaking her personality.

180
00:11:04,598 --> 00:11:06,623
Sanding off the rough edges,
if you will.

181
00:11:06,793 --> 00:11:08,834
No. You're not sanding Penny.

182
00:11:09,657 --> 00:11:12,471
Are you saying that I am forbidden

183
00:11:12,596 --> 00:11:15,329
from applying a harmless,
scientifically valid protocol

184
00:11:15,454 --> 00:11:17,008
that will make our lives better?

185
00:11:17,598 --> 00:11:19,969
Yes. You're forbidden.

186
00:11:23,457 --> 00:11:24,817
Bad Leonard.

187
00:11:33,773 --> 00:11:34,985
So, what do you guys do?

188
00:11:35,764 --> 00:11:37,201
You know, goth stuff.

189
00:11:37,326 --> 00:11:39,194
Goth magazines, goth music.

190
00:11:39,508 --> 00:11:40,627
Goth food.

191
00:11:41,703 --> 00:11:42,992
What's goth food?

192
00:11:45,638 --> 00:11:47,126
Blackened salmon?

193
00:11:48,793 --> 00:11:51,335
No, I meant what do you do for jobs?

194
00:11:51,763 --> 00:11:53,087
We're scientists.

195
00:11:53,255 --> 00:11:55,463
Yeah, you know, the dark sciences.

196
00:11:55,797 --> 00:11:57,383
What are the dark sciences?

197
00:11:59,056 --> 00:12:00,828
Well, I am an astrophysicist,

198
00:12:00,953 --> 00:12:03,179
and a lot of that
takes place at night.

199
00:12:04,826 --> 00:12:06,515
When there are vampires

200
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:09,288
and miscellaneous
undead out and about.

201
00:12:10,579 --> 00:12:11,598
<i>Oy vay.</i>

202
00:12:13,516 --> 00:12:14,859
That sounds really cool.

203
00:12:16,245 --> 00:12:18,610
Does it? Okay.
If you like space stuff,

204
00:12:18,735 --> 00:12:21,106
I design components
for the International Space Station,

205
00:12:21,231 --> 00:12:22,247
which is in space.

206
00:12:22,372 --> 00:12:24,863
Where, as I'm sure you know,
no one can hear you scream.

207
00:12:28,768 --> 00:12:31,292
- So, what do you gals do?
- I work at the Gap.

208
00:12:31,647 --> 00:12:34,377
Really? How about that?
I've been to the Gap.

209
00:12:34,548 --> 00:12:37,681
I've been there, as well. I like
your t-shirts with the little pocket.

210
00:12:38,987 --> 00:12:40,456
I work there, too.

211
00:12:40,581 --> 00:12:42,017
Not that anyone cares.

212
00:12:44,692 --> 00:12:46,931
You know, this place is boring.

213
00:12:48,848 --> 00:12:51,060
Why don't we go somewhere else
and have some fun?

214
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:53,646
- Okay.
- Sure, we like fun.

215
00:12:53,817 --> 00:12:56,685
- We are fun people.
- Dark and fun.

216
00:12:57,733 --> 00:13:00,178
Come on.
I know a place you'll really dig.

217
00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:05,582
- Did you bring the black condoms?
- In my fanny pack.

218
00:13:05,707 --> 00:13:06,707
Let's go.

219
00:13:14,207 --> 00:13:15,672
Are you happy now?

220
00:13:18,207 --> 00:13:19,531
Not particularly.

221
00:13:23,927 --> 00:13:25,511
Oh, my God, she didn't!

222
00:13:27,932 --> 00:13:30,184
What could she possibly
be talking about for so long?

223
00:13:30,849 --> 00:13:33,207
Obviously, waitressing
at the Cheesecake Factory

224
00:13:33,332 --> 00:13:35,884
is a complex socioeconomic activity

225
00:13:36,009 --> 00:13:39,160
that requires a great deal
of analysis and planning.

226
00:13:41,893 --> 00:13:43,133
Bazinga.

227
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:48,020
You know, using positive
reinforcement techniques,

228
00:13:48,145 --> 00:13:50,764
I could train that behavior
out of her in a week.

229
00:13:52,584 --> 00:13:55,745
Let me use negative reinforcement,
I can get it done before we go to bed.

230
00:13:56,446 --> 00:13:59,396
You're not squirting her
in the face with water.

231
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:01,040
Of course not.

232
00:14:01,208 --> 00:14:02,967
We're talking
very mild electric shocks.

233
00:14:04,208 --> 00:14:06,108
No tissue damage whatsoever.

234
00:14:07,203 --> 00:14:09,206
- Forget it.
- Oh, come on.

235
00:14:09,331 --> 00:14:10,391
You can't tell me

236
00:14:10,559 --> 00:14:12,833
that you're not intrigued
about the possibility

237
00:14:12,958 --> 00:14:14,686
of building a better girlfriend.

238
00:14:14,898 --> 00:14:15,898
I'm not.

239
00:14:16,167 --> 00:14:18,335
Penny's qualities,
both good and bad,

240
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:20,310
are what make her who she is.

241
00:14:24,169 --> 00:14:26,864
You mean, like that high-pitched,
irritating laugh?

242
00:14:29,370 --> 00:14:31,820
You wouldn't prefer
a throaty chuckle?

243
00:14:32,539 --> 00:14:34,939
You're not changing
how Penny laughs.

244
00:14:35,588 --> 00:14:37,126
That would be incongruous.

245
00:14:37,386 --> 00:14:40,004
I was going to lower the whole voice
to a more pleasing register.

246
00:14:41,922 --> 00:14:43,022
Sorry, guys.

247
00:14:43,271 --> 00:14:45,160
That girl is freaky.

248
00:14:46,678 --> 00:14:47,678
Come again?

249
00:14:48,219 --> 00:14:49,178
Freaky.

250
00:14:49,648 --> 00:14:51,548
- Freaky?
- Yeah, freaky.

251
00:15:00,418 --> 00:15:01,768
Have a chocolate.

252
00:15:12,769 --> 00:15:14,393
Are you going to deface your body

253
00:15:14,518 --> 00:15:16,645
just for the possibility
you could have cheap sex

254
00:15:16,770 --> 00:15:18,417
with a strange girl
you met in a bar?

255
00:15:22,226 --> 00:15:23,671
What is your mother going to say?

256
00:15:23,967 --> 00:15:25,767
She's not going to see it.

257
00:15:25,954 --> 00:15:28,217
She takes my temperature orally now.

258
00:15:31,557 --> 00:15:32,997
What are you going to get?

259
00:15:33,122 --> 00:15:34,647
I can't really decide

260
00:15:34,772 --> 00:15:37,456
between a screaming devil,
this mean little skull,

261
00:15:37,581 --> 00:15:39,031
or Kermit the frog.

262
00:15:40,344 --> 00:15:41,971
- Kermit the frog?
- You know.

263
00:15:42,096 --> 00:15:44,006
<i>Hi-ho. I'm on Howard's butt.</i>

264
00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:47,815
Get the mean little skull,

265
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:49,615
and I'll see
if I can make him smile.

266
00:15:49,783 --> 00:15:52,283
I'd like the mean
little skull, please.

267
00:15:53,032 --> 00:15:55,082
What are you going to get, Raj?

268
00:15:55,335 --> 00:15:57,035
With my luck, hepatitis.

269
00:15:59,189 --> 00:16:00,539
Okay, here we go.

270
00:16:02,336 --> 00:16:04,136
That's just rubbing alcohol.

271
00:16:04,824 --> 00:16:06,524
I know, but it was cold.

272
00:16:08,753 --> 00:16:10,259
I'm putting on the stencil.

273
00:16:10,429 --> 00:16:12,929
- What comes after the stencil?
- This.

274
00:16:19,521 --> 00:16:21,522
No needle. No pain.
No tattoo.

275
00:16:21,690 --> 00:16:23,903
What's the big deal?
You've done this before.

276
00:16:24,028 --> 00:16:25,990
No, I haven't. Look.

277
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:30,574
I'm sorry. I'm a fraud.
He's a fraud.

278
00:16:30,699 --> 00:16:32,950
- We're both frauds.
- I think I covered that.

279
00:16:33,118 --> 00:16:34,668
But I was summing up.

280
00:16:37,326 --> 00:16:39,326
We're not goth.
We're just...

281
00:16:40,139 --> 00:16:41,139
Guys.

282
00:16:41,264 --> 00:16:42,864
Very, very smart guys.

283
00:16:43,302 --> 00:16:44,794
So you were totally scamming us?

284
00:16:47,437 --> 00:16:49,091
And I wouldn't blame you

285
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:52,193
if you walked out of here
and never wanted to see us again.

286
00:16:52,638 --> 00:16:56,319
Unless, of course, our bold honesty
has suddenly made us attractive.

287
00:16:56,444 --> 00:16:57,894
Huh? Huh? Anything?

288
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:01,960
I'm leaving.

289
00:17:06,451 --> 00:17:07,801
I'm leaving, too.

290
00:17:08,162 --> 00:17:09,762
Not that anyone cares.

291
00:17:17,451 --> 00:17:20,329
When we tell this story,
let's end it differently.

292
00:17:21,446 --> 00:17:24,688
What are you thinking?
Maybe a big musical number?

293
00:17:29,137 --> 00:17:32,485
Well, I'm going to make
some warm milk and then turn in.

294
00:17:33,324 --> 00:17:36,699
I trust if you two are planning
on engaging in amorous activities,

295
00:17:36,824 --> 00:17:38,681
you'll keep the decibel level
to a minimum.

296
00:17:39,479 --> 00:17:40,479
Of course.

297
00:17:40,889 --> 00:17:41,889
Thank you.

298
00:17:44,811 --> 00:17:46,349
These are so good.

299
00:17:48,292 --> 00:17:49,442
Unbelievable.

300
00:17:51,575 --> 00:17:52,575
What?

301
00:17:52,950 --> 00:17:55,741
I was just thinking
we should probably turn in, too.

302
00:17:56,305 --> 00:17:57,785
My new bed got delivered.

303
00:17:57,953 --> 00:18:00,036
If you put it together,
you can stay at my place.

304
00:18:00,463 --> 00:18:02,456
That's a lot of work,
and it's kind of late.

305
00:18:02,624 --> 00:18:04,540
But if we stay there,
we won't have to be quiet.

306
00:18:04,819 --> 00:18:05,819
Let's go.

307
00:18:09,156 --> 00:18:10,256
Interesting.

308
00:18:11,167 --> 00:18:14,930
Sex works even better than chocolate
to modify behavior.

309
00:18:17,917 --> 00:18:20,817
I wonder if anyone else
has stumbled onto that.

310
00:18:28,118 --> 00:18:29,567
Okay, wait.
How about this?

311
00:18:29,801 --> 00:18:32,001
We say there were four goth girls.

312
00:18:32,178 --> 00:18:34,414
The two girls in the club
had two friends.

313
00:18:34,824 --> 00:18:35,983
I like it, I like it.

314
00:18:36,342 --> 00:18:39,202
Did they smell good despite
their goth-like nature?

315
00:18:39,968 --> 00:18:41,162
What's the matter?

316
00:18:41,372 --> 00:18:43,873
Engaging my olfactory sense
helps make it real for me.

317
00:18:44,176 --> 00:18:45,876
Fine, they smelled good.

318
00:18:46,085 --> 00:18:48,585
They did.
Like jasmine and honeysuckle.

319
00:18:51,507 --> 00:18:54,505
Then they held hands and did
a sexy, demonic hokey pokey for us.

320
00:18:56,207 --> 00:18:59,223
Let me say my story then you say yours,
then we'll pick.

321
00:18:59,348 --> 00:19:00,348
Sorry. Go on.

322
00:19:00,676 --> 00:19:01,803
We got tattoos,

323
00:19:01,928 --> 00:19:04,227
and then the four girls
took us to their place.

324
00:19:04,437 --> 00:19:06,813
But we don't have tattoos.
What if someone asks to see them?

325
00:19:07,414 --> 00:19:09,914
We say
they're in a very intimate area.

326
00:19:11,002 --> 00:19:12,650
We're bad boys, aren't we?

327
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:19,951
So, we go back to their place
and the six of us end up in a hot tub.

328
00:19:20,161 --> 00:19:21,384
But we just got tattoos.

329
00:19:21,509 --> 00:19:24,330
Wouldn't we be concerned
about bacterial infection?

330
00:19:25,341 --> 00:19:27,441
True. Okay.
Forget the hot tub.

331
00:19:27,664 --> 00:19:31,668
The point is, we each had
a <i>ménage</i> with sexy goth girls.

332
00:19:35,428 --> 00:19:36,878
What a great night.

333
00:19:45,619 --> 00:19:47,520
Want to try a country bar
tomorrow night?

334
00:19:48,006 --> 00:19:50,106
Maybe we'll get lucky
with some sexy cowgirls.

335
00:19:50,951 --> 00:19:52,101
Could happen.

336
00:19:55,023 --> 00:19:56,404
I wonder how they smell.
