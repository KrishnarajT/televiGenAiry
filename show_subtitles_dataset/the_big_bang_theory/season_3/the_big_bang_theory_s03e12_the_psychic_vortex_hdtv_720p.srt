1
00:00:02,103 --> 00:00:05,188
Look at us.
Getting ready for a double date

2
00:00:05,256 --> 00:00:07,324
with actual women
who publicly acknowledge

3
00:00:07,391 --> 00:00:09,826
they're our girlfriends.

4
00:00:09,894 --> 00:00:13,196
Yes, actual women are the best.

5
00:00:13,264 --> 00:00:14,264
I don't understand.

6
00:00:14,332 --> 00:00:15,665
What other kind of women are there?

7
00:00:15,733 --> 00:00:18,668
Howard, artificial women
are your department.

8
00:00:18,736 --> 00:00:21,671
You want to take this?

9
00:00:21,739 --> 00:00:24,708
No, it would just freak him out.

10
00:00:24,775 --> 00:00:27,210
Listen, before we leave,

11
00:00:27,278 --> 00:00:30,213
I should warn you,
I'm a passionate man

12
00:00:30,281 --> 00:00:33,750
and I tend towards public
displays of affection.

13
00:00:33,818 --> 00:00:37,654
What are you trying
to tell me, Howard?

14
00:00:37,722 --> 00:00:40,357
There might be some making out
in the car or the restaurant,

15
00:00:40,424 --> 00:00:42,259
and I don't want Bernadette
to feel uncomfortable,

16
00:00:42,326 --> 00:00:46,096
so it would help if you
and Penny made out, too.

17
00:00:46,164 --> 00:00:48,098
Don't worry.

18
00:00:48,166 --> 00:00:50,390
We're planning to have sex
right on the salad bar.

19
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:54,394
<i>Namaste, white people.</i>

20
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:57,096
Good news!

21
00:00:57,164 --> 00:01:00,400
<i>I rented us the fou
r-hour edition of Watchmen.</i>

22
00:01:00,467 --> 00:01:01,334
Got it. Seen it.

23
00:01:01,402 --> 00:01:03,836
Detailed analysis posted online.

24
00:01:03,904 --> 00:01:06,205
Well, then what are we going
to do tonight?

25
00:01:06,273 --> 00:01:07,440
Uh, sorry, Raj.

26
00:01:07,508 --> 00:01:08,641
Howard and
I are going out to dinner

27
00:01:08,709 --> 00:01:10,009
with Penny and Bernadette. Yeah.

28
00:01:10,077 --> 00:01:12,712
No more carefree bachelor
nights for me and Leonard.

29
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:15,248
These broncos have been saddled.

30
00:01:20,154 --> 00:01:22,121
<i>How did we get actual women?</i>

31
00:01:22,189 --> 00:01:24,123
Great.

32
00:01:24,191 --> 00:01:26,025
They get girlfriends,
and they just abandon us?

33
00:01:26,093 --> 00:01:27,994
It is great, isn't it?

34
00:01:29,330 --> 00:01:31,397
We have a wonderful evening
ahead of us. We do?

35
00:01:31,465 --> 00:01:33,566
Oh, yes. I just discovered
I don't have

36
00:01:33,634 --> 00:01:35,902
enough room on my hard drive
for a Linux partition,

37
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:38,237
so you and I are going
to perform a full backup,

38
00:01:38,305 --> 00:01:41,574
reinitialize and then reinstall
all my operating systems.

39
00:01:41,642 --> 00:01:44,043
I don't want to do that.

40
00:01:44,111 --> 00:01:45,378
All right.

41
00:01:45,446 --> 00:01:47,380
Well, I'm going to perform full backup,

42
00:01:47,448 --> 00:01:50,883
reinitialize and then reinstall
all my operating systems.

43
00:01:50,951 --> 00:01:51,985
What about me?

44
00:01:52,052 --> 00:01:53,987
Well, I understand

45
00:01:54,054 --> 00:01:56,956
there are several types
of artificial women.

46
00:01:58,325 --> 00:02:00,426
Maybe you should look into that.

47
00:02:02,162 --> 00:02:05,698
* Our whole universe was
in a hot, dense state *

48
00:02:05,766 --> 00:02:09,524
* Then nearly 14 billion years
ago expansion started... Wait! *

49
00:02:09,592 --> 00:02:10,259
* The Earth began to cool *

50
00:02:10,327 --> 00:02:12,828
* The autotrophs began to drool,
Neanderthals developed tools *

51
00:02:12,896 --> 00:02:15,364
<i>* We built the Wall * *
We built the pyramids *</i>

52
00:02:15,432 --> 00:02:18,034
* Math, Science, History,
unraveling the mystery *

53
00:02:18,101 --> 00:02:19,936
* That all started with a big bang *

54
00:02:19,638 --> 00:02:23,638
Sync by Drou

55
00:02:28,422 --> 00:02:30,023
Dude, there's so many cool things

56
00:02:30,091 --> 00:02:31,892
we could be doing tonight. Look.

57
00:02:31,959 --> 00:02:33,727
At the Glendale Galleria,

58
00:02:33,795 --> 00:02:35,729
"Put on your best zoot suit,

59
00:02:35,797 --> 00:02:38,632
"it's a salute to Swing music
in the center court near Macy's.

60
00:02:38,699 --> 00:02:39,800
5:00 p.m. to 9 p.m."

61
00:02:39,867 --> 00:02:41,802
Huh? Huh?

62
00:02:44,561 --> 00:02:45,529
Sounds like a hoot.

63
00:02:46,096 --> 00:02:47,463
I'm sorry, Raj,

64
00:02:47,531 --> 00:02:50,500
I have no desire to salute any
article of clothing tonight.

65
00:02:50,567 --> 00:02:54,003
Much less one that's linked
to race riots in the 1940s.

66
00:02:54,071 --> 00:02:55,104
Race riots?

67
00:02:55,172 --> 00:02:57,473
The zoot suit riots.

68
00:02:57,541 --> 00:03:00,143
Oh.

69
00:03:00,210 --> 00:03:04,347
I always thought that was some
sort of after-Christmas sale.

70
00:03:06,350 --> 00:03:08,284
Well, then why don't we just go
to the galleria and walk around?

71
00:03:08,352 --> 00:03:10,286
But I don't need anything at the Galleria.

72
00:03:10,354 --> 00:03:11,954
Do you need anything at the Galleria?

73
00:03:12,022 --> 00:03:13,856
No. We would just walk
around and see what's what.

74
00:03:15,893 --> 00:03:19,295
That's a semantically null sentence.

75
00:03:19,363 --> 00:03:21,798
Okay, well, how about this?

76
00:03:21,865 --> 00:03:23,633
From the university Web site:

77
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:26,636
7:00 p.m. to 10:00 p.m.,
Norton Hall Multipurpose Room,

78
00:03:26,703 --> 00:03:29,305
"mixer for grad students and faculty

79
00:03:29,373 --> 00:03:31,808
"of the science
and humanities departments.

80
00:03:31,875 --> 00:03:33,810
"Whether you split atoms or infinitives,

81
00:03:33,877 --> 00:03:36,712
this is the place to be."

82
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:39,982
Well, that's certainly amusing, but...

83
00:03:40,050 --> 00:03:42,018
I have no interest.

84
00:03:42,086 --> 00:03:43,686
Come on, Sheldon,

85
00:03:43,754 --> 00:03:46,022
the world is filled with
people doing things outside.

86
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:47,356
Let's go outside.

87
00:03:47,424 --> 00:03:49,826
Outside is good.

88
00:03:49,893 --> 00:03:52,829
If outside is so good,
why has mankind spent thousands of years

89
00:03:52,896 --> 00:03:54,597
trying to perfect inside?

90
00:03:54,665 --> 00:03:56,866
I don't know,
it's a marketing scheme.

91
00:03:58,302 --> 00:03:59,735
Please, Sheldon, I'm a young,

92
00:03:59,803 --> 00:04:01,860
virile visitor from a foreign land

93
00:04:01,888 --> 00:04:05,157
and I need to strut my stuff.

94
00:04:05,224 --> 00:04:07,526
Let me offer you a compromise.

95
00:04:07,594 --> 00:04:11,063
Sometimes when I feel stifled
and want a change of scenery,

96
00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:14,099
I use my imagination.

97
00:04:14,167 --> 00:04:15,300
Oh, boy.

98
00:04:15,368 --> 00:04:17,169
One of my favorite places

99
00:04:17,236 --> 00:04:19,071
to visit is the two-dimensional world

100
00:04:19,138 --> 00:04:21,573
described in Edwin Abbott's
mathematical fantasy,

101
00:04:21,641 --> 00:04:22,808
"Flatland."

102
00:04:22,875 --> 00:04:25,444
I don't want to go to Flatland.

103
00:04:25,511 --> 00:04:27,446
You're only saying that because
you haven't been there.

104
00:04:30,617 --> 00:04:34,119
I am now a hexagon in two-dimensional space

105
00:04:34,187 --> 00:04:37,456
and can only perceive the
edges of other objects.

106
00:04:37,523 --> 00:04:39,625
Oy.

107
00:04:39,692 --> 00:04:41,627
Is that you, Raj?

108
00:04:41,694 --> 00:04:43,962
I don't recognize your edge.

109
00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:45,964
Sheldon, I'm begging you.

110
00:04:46,032 --> 00:04:48,634
I want to go to this mixer,
and I don't want to go alone.

111
00:04:48,701 --> 00:04:50,902
Well, you're in luck.

112
00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:54,106
There's a mixer here in Flatland.

113
00:04:55,708 --> 00:04:59,645
Oh, look, there's a sexually
attractive line segment.

114
00:04:59,712 --> 00:05:02,180
You should chat her up.

115
00:05:02,248 --> 00:05:03,682
What? Tell her you're a circle.

116
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:06,351
Flatland gals are all hot for circles.

117
00:05:09,122 --> 00:05:10,689
I hope you're hungry, Bernadette.

118
00:05:10,757 --> 00:05:12,324
We're going to a terrific restaurant.

119
00:05:12,392 --> 00:05:13,792
Oh, yeah, I'm starved.

120
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:15,594
When you spend all day in a bio-lab,

121
00:05:15,662 --> 00:05:18,263
watching flesh-eating bacteria
skeletonize small rodents,

122
00:05:18,331 --> 00:05:20,322
it really works up an appetite.

123
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:23,324
Flesh-eating bacteria.

124
00:05:23,392 --> 00:05:25,326
And yet, I still want to kiss this woman.

125
00:05:25,394 --> 00:05:26,660
What does that tell you?

126
00:05:26,728 --> 00:05:28,662
That you'd be willing
to die a horrible death

127
00:05:28,730 --> 00:05:30,564
on the off-chance you'd get to second base?

128
00:05:31,767 --> 00:05:33,534
Oh, we're way past second base.

129
00:05:33,602 --> 00:05:34,869
Right, Howard?

130
00:05:34,936 --> 00:05:37,204
Well, we kind of disagree

131
00:05:37,272 --> 00:05:40,207
about what the bases are.

132
00:05:40,275 --> 00:05:42,109
How's your work going, Penny?

133
00:05:42,177 --> 00:05:43,611
Any acting jobs?

134
00:05:43,678 --> 00:05:45,780
Well, the last big thing
I did was this production

135
00:05:45,847 --> 00:05:48,182
<i>of Diary of Anne Frank above
a bowling alley.</i>

136
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:51,752
But I think things might be
turning around pretty soon.

137
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:53,854
Great. How come?

138
00:05:53,922 --> 00:05:56,056
Well, promise you won't make fun of me.

139
00:05:56,124 --> 00:05:58,492
Of course, I would never make fun of you.

140
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,994
Okay.

141
00:06:00,061 --> 00:06:02,997
Well, I went to this psychic who
told me that if I cut my hair,

142
00:06:03,064 --> 00:06:05,065
I'm going to get a national commercial.

143
00:06:06,802 --> 00:06:08,436
Wh... Seriously?

144
00:06:08,503 --> 00:06:11,439
You're getting career advice from a psychic?

145
00:06:11,506 --> 00:06:14,875
Good job not making fun of her.

146
00:06:14,943 --> 00:06:17,044
She's not one of those phonies, okay.

147
00:06:17,112 --> 00:06:19,547
She wrote a book and has her own Web site.

148
00:06:19,614 --> 00:06:20,781
Oh, gee, why didn't you say so?

149
00:06:20,849 --> 00:06:23,217
They don't let just anyone have a Web site.

150
00:06:23,285 --> 00:06:25,719
Why are you being such a jerk?

151
00:06:25,787 --> 00:06:27,021
You're surprised?

152
00:06:27,088 --> 00:06:29,323
Your psychic tell you I
was going to be a jerk?

153
00:06:29,391 --> 00:06:31,592
Bite me.

154
00:06:33,128 --> 00:06:34,395
Come on, Penny.

155
00:06:34,463 --> 00:06:36,063
Why don't you kids go ahead and chat?

156
00:06:36,131 --> 00:06:36,854
We're gonna make out back here.

157
00:06:41,592 --> 00:06:44,460
I'm sliding into third.

158
00:06:47,765 --> 00:06:48,966
Thanks for coming with me.

159
00:06:49,033 --> 00:06:50,300
Thanks for giving me

160
00:06:50,368 --> 00:06:52,503
<i>your limited edition Green Lantern
lantern.</i>

161
00:06:52,570 --> 00:06:55,105
Did you really have to bring it in with you?

162
00:06:55,173 --> 00:06:58,175
What if evil strikes and
my power ring runs low?

163
00:07:02,914 --> 00:07:04,848
Come on, let's get a drink. I don't drink.

164
00:07:04,916 --> 00:07:06,250
Yeah, well I do.

165
00:07:06,317 --> 00:07:08,519
<i>And when my wingman is carrying
a Green Lantern lantern,</i>

166
00:07:08,586 --> 00:07:10,120
I drink a lot.

167
00:07:10,188 --> 00:07:12,122
I'll have a screwdriver, please.

168
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:14,525
Don't be chintzy with the screw.

169
00:07:14,592 --> 00:07:17,227
I would like a root beer float.

170
00:07:17,295 --> 00:07:20,197
Sheldon, they don't have ice cream.

171
00:07:20,265 --> 00:07:22,032
They don't?

172
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:23,934
Well, apparently,
these people and I differ greatly

173
00:07:24,002 --> 00:07:25,969
on the definition of "party."

174
00:07:26,037 --> 00:07:28,305
He'll have a Shirley Temple.

175
00:07:28,373 --> 00:07:30,374
And don't be chintzy with the Shirley.

176
00:07:33,578 --> 00:07:35,546
Okay,

177
00:07:35,613 --> 00:07:37,214
let's check out the females.

178
00:07:37,282 --> 00:07:38,549
All right.

179
00:07:38,616 --> 00:07:40,484
There's a female.

180
00:07:40,552 --> 00:07:42,019
That's Professor Wilkinson's wife.

181
00:07:42,086 --> 00:07:43,320
She's like 80 years old.

182
00:07:43,388 --> 00:07:45,155
But she's female.

183
00:07:45,223 --> 00:07:46,657
Isn't that the game? No.

184
00:07:46,724 --> 00:07:48,225
I'm looking for a hookup.

185
00:07:48,293 --> 00:07:50,060
Oh, yes.

186
00:07:50,128 --> 00:07:51,562
So, the point of this exercise is

187
00:07:51,629 --> 00:07:54,231
for you to find someone to copulate with?

188
00:07:54,299 --> 00:07:55,732
Not so loud,

189
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:56,890
but ideally, yes.

190
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:01,193
Thanks.

191
00:08:01,261 --> 00:08:02,995
Thank you.

192
00:08:03,063 --> 00:08:05,331
And what is my function as "wingman?"

193
00:08:05,399 --> 00:08:06,966
You help me run my game.

194
00:08:07,033 --> 00:08:08,000
Okay.

195
00:08:08,068 --> 00:08:11,537
What is your game?

196
00:08:11,605 --> 00:08:13,739
When I lie through my teeth to a woman,

197
00:08:13,807 --> 00:08:15,808
you nod and agree.

198
00:08:16,910 --> 00:08:18,377
Hey, that's pretty cool.

199
00:08:18,445 --> 00:08:19,512
What is it?

200
00:08:19,579 --> 00:08:21,013
It's a limited edition

201
00:08:21,081 --> 00:08:22,515
<i>Green Lantern lantern.</i>

202
00:08:22,582 --> 00:08:26,352
My friend is looking for
someone to copulate with.

203
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:28,154
You're very funny.

204
00:08:28,221 --> 00:08:29,188
I'm Abby.

205
00:08:29,256 --> 00:08:31,190
I'm Sheldon. How do you do?

206
00:08:31,258 --> 00:08:33,192
Rajesh Ramayan Koothrappali.

207
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:34,860
Call me Raj. Hi, Raj.

208
00:08:34,928 --> 00:08:36,195
Where are you from?

209
00:08:36,263 --> 00:08:38,531
The mysterious subcontinent of India.

210
00:08:38,598 --> 00:08:39,865
Ooh, India.

211
00:08:39,933 --> 00:08:42,034
<i>You know India? I saw Slumdog
Millionaire.</i>

212
00:08:42,102 --> 00:08:44,770
Well, I'm a slumdog astrophysicist.

213
00:08:46,873 --> 00:08:49,074
I thought your father was a gynecologist.

214
00:08:50,143 --> 00:08:51,444
I'm sorry.

215
00:08:55,182 --> 00:08:56,449
Martha, come here.

216
00:08:56,516 --> 00:08:57,783
Meet Raj and Sheldon.

217
00:08:57,851 --> 00:08:59,218
This is my friend, Martha. Hi.

218
00:08:59,286 --> 00:09:00,486
Hello. Hello.

219
00:09:00,554 --> 00:09:02,321
Is that the limited edition

220
00:09:02,389 --> 00:09:03,989
<i>Green Lantern lantern?</i>

221
00:09:04,057 --> 00:09:07,159
"In brightest day, in darkest night,

222
00:09:07,227 --> 00:09:09,228
no evil shall escape my sight."

223
00:09:11,865 --> 00:09:13,823
Oh, that is so awesome.

224
00:09:15,191 --> 00:09:16,424
Thank you.

225
00:09:16,492 --> 00:09:18,827
Have you chosen one to copulate with?

226
00:09:31,407 --> 00:09:35,076
So, what should we talk about?

227
00:09:36,245 --> 00:09:38,179
Well, we could always learn more

228
00:09:38,247 --> 00:09:40,548
about why people who believe
in psychics are idiots.

229
00:09:40,616 --> 00:09:41,883
Leonard?

230
00:09:45,221 --> 00:09:47,155
Oh, we don't need to
talk about that anymore.

231
00:09:47,223 --> 00:09:49,691
Leonard covered it pretty well in the car.

232
00:09:49,759 --> 00:09:53,128
I'm sorry, but facts are facts.

233
00:09:53,195 --> 00:09:54,829
Right, and if you can't understand it,

234
00:09:54,897 --> 00:09:56,464
it's not a fact.

235
00:09:56,532 --> 00:09:59,634
No, if it's not a fact, it's not a fact.

236
00:09:59,702 --> 00:10:00,635
Oh, got it.

237
00:10:00,703 --> 00:10:01,836
Thank you for educating me.

238
00:10:01,904 --> 00:10:05,106
You're welcome.

239
00:10:05,174 --> 00:10:06,241
How's your fish?

240
00:10:06,309 --> 00:10:07,242
Amazing.

241
00:10:07,310 --> 00:10:08,543
Would you like to try some?

242
00:10:08,611 --> 00:10:09,711
Yeah, sure. Well, the fact is,

243
00:10:09,779 --> 00:10:11,880
you can't.

244
00:10:11,948 --> 00:10:14,683
Come on, Howard, Bernadette,
you're both scientists.

245
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:16,017
Help me out here.

246
00:10:16,085 --> 00:10:17,419
What do you think-- want to jump

247
00:10:17,486 --> 00:10:18,687
right in the middle of
another couple's argument?

248
00:10:18,754 --> 00:10:19,688
No, thank you.

249
00:10:19,755 --> 00:10:21,056
Sorry.

250
00:10:22,258 --> 00:10:25,393
Maybe we should just
stop talking about this.

251
00:10:25,461 --> 00:10:28,396
Maybe some of us should
stop talking altogether.

252
00:10:28,464 --> 00:10:30,398
How is everything tonight?

253
00:10:30,466 --> 00:10:32,567
Really uncomfortable.

254
00:10:35,494 --> 00:10:37,195
You know, the best thing
about being in a committed,

255
00:10:37,263 --> 00:10:39,163
monogamous, mutually supportive relationship

256
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:41,065
is that even if you have different ideas,

257
00:10:41,133 --> 00:10:43,701
you can have a spirited debate,
yet still care for,

258
00:10:43,769 --> 00:10:45,937
even make love with...

259
00:10:47,973 --> 00:10:50,608
Want your fish?

260
00:10:53,946 --> 00:10:55,513
I knew you were going to do that.

261
00:10:55,581 --> 00:10:57,081
Doesn't make me psychic!

262
00:10:59,118 --> 00:11:02,453
Attaboy, Leonard, make it worse.

263
00:11:03,455 --> 00:11:05,657
* American woman *

264
00:11:05,724 --> 00:11:09,761
* Listen what I say... *

265
00:11:10,796 --> 00:11:12,730
What's going on?

266
00:11:12,798 --> 00:11:15,600
We scored.

267
00:11:16,702 --> 00:11:18,803
I'm the wingman.

268
00:11:18,871 --> 00:11:21,205
* American woman. *

269
00:11:28,213 --> 00:11:29,014
Hey.

270
00:11:29,081 --> 00:11:31,683
Laser. Had a great night last night.

271
00:11:31,751 --> 00:11:33,852
I don't like to kiss and tell,

272
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:36,922
but somebody made it to eighth base.

273
00:11:39,724 --> 00:11:42,092
What the hell is eighth base?

274
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,195
Seventh base with shirt off.

275
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:47,865
Well, my shirt.

276
00:11:47,933 --> 00:11:49,200
How'd things go

277
00:11:49,267 --> 00:11:50,201
with Penny?

278
00:11:50,268 --> 00:11:51,869
Oh... couldn't be better.

279
00:11:57,097 --> 00:11:57,830
Are we taking

280
00:11:57,898 --> 00:12:01,501
our relationship frustrations
out on innocent Cylons?

281
00:12:01,569 --> 00:12:02,802
It's not just Cylons.

282
00:12:02,870 --> 00:12:04,103
Superman's next.

283
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:08,474
All right, I was going to try to squeeze in

284
00:12:08,542 --> 00:12:09,909
a little more mocking before lunch,

285
00:12:09,977 --> 00:12:11,144
but I can come back later

286
00:12:11,212 --> 00:12:13,780
when you don't have a high-powered weapon.

287
00:12:13,847 --> 00:12:17,917
How can I go out with a woman
who believes in psychics?

288
00:12:17,985 --> 00:12:19,686
Hey, I once dated a girl

289
00:12:19,753 --> 00:12:22,021
who believed she was abducted by aliens.

290
00:12:22,089 --> 00:12:23,523
And that didn't bother you?

291
00:12:23,591 --> 00:12:24,924
Au contraire.

292
00:12:24,992 --> 00:12:27,860
It meant she was gullible and
open to a little probing.

293
00:12:27,928 --> 00:12:30,163
What am I supposed to do,

294
00:12:30,231 --> 00:12:32,765
pretend I believe something I
don't whenever I'm with Penny?

295
00:12:32,833 --> 00:12:35,835
Hey, I'm sure Penny fakes
all kinds of things

296
00:12:35,903 --> 00:12:38,371
when she's with you.

297
00:12:38,439 --> 00:12:42,242
Do me a favor-- lean over,
put your head right here.

298
00:12:42,309 --> 00:12:45,311
Let me show you another way to look at this.

299
00:12:45,379 --> 00:12:49,315
Here we have the universe of all women.

300
00:12:49,383 --> 00:12:50,450
These are the ones

301
00:12:50,517 --> 00:12:51,818
you want to sleep with.

302
00:12:51,885 --> 00:12:54,954
These are the women who believe
exactly what you believe.

303
00:12:55,022 --> 00:12:57,690
These are the women who would
be willing to sleep with you.

304
00:12:59,693 --> 00:13:02,629
And right there in the
little triple intersection...

305
00:13:02,696 --> 00:13:04,063
is your ideal mate.

306
00:13:04,131 --> 00:13:07,000
Odds are she's a short
physicist with low self-esteem

307
00:13:07,067 --> 00:13:10,236
who lives in a government
research facility in China.

308
00:13:10,304 --> 00:13:12,572
What's your point?

309
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:15,164
In order to keep having a
sexual relationship with Penny,

310
00:13:15,181 --> 00:13:17,082
I have to give up everything I believe in--

311
00:13:17,150 --> 00:13:18,817
my intellectual integrity, the very nature

312
00:13:18,885 --> 00:13:20,519
of who I am?

313
00:13:20,587 --> 00:13:22,588
I can't do that, Howard.

314
00:13:22,655 --> 00:13:24,456
I respect that.

315
00:13:27,327 --> 00:13:28,327
What is that?

316
00:13:28,394 --> 00:13:29,528
Your new girlfriend.

317
00:13:30,563 --> 00:13:32,064
Have fun tonight.

318
00:13:35,135 --> 00:13:37,703
The dog...

319
00:13:37,771 --> 00:13:40,806
<i>koira.</i>

320
00:13:40,874 --> 00:13:43,342
The roof...

321
00:13:43,409 --> 00:13:46,512
<i>katto.</i>

322
00:13:46,579 --> 00:13:50,249
Grapes...

323
00:13:50,316 --> 00:13:52,484
<i>ryp‰leet.</i>

324
00:13:55,255 --> 00:13:57,089
One minute.

325
00:13:58,825 --> 00:14:01,126
<i>Sis‰‰n.</i>

326
00:14:01,194 --> 00:14:03,395
What was that?

327
00:14:03,463 --> 00:14:04,797
It means "come in."

328
00:14:04,864 --> 00:14:06,098
It's taking forever to load

329
00:14:06,166 --> 00:14:08,267
the new operating system on my computer.

330
00:14:08,334 --> 00:14:10,602
I disinfected the kitchen and the bathroom,

331
00:14:10,670 --> 00:14:13,539
and now I thought I'd learn Finnish.

332
00:14:16,543 --> 00:14:18,043
That's Hindi for

333
00:14:18,111 --> 00:14:19,711
"Whatever floats your boat."

334
00:14:19,779 --> 00:14:22,881
Uh, listen, I got a text
from that girl Abby,

335
00:14:22,949 --> 00:14:25,551
and she and her friend Martha
want to hang out with us again.

336
00:14:25,618 --> 00:14:26,552
What do you say?

337
00:14:26,619 --> 00:14:28,320
I don't say anything.

338
00:14:28,388 --> 00:14:30,022
I merely offer you a facial expression

339
00:14:30,089 --> 00:14:31,547
that suggests you've gone insane.

340
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:34,999
I don't get it.

341
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:36,074
You had a great time.

342
00:14:36,141 --> 00:14:38,276
Yes, exactly, I had a great time.

343
00:14:38,344 --> 00:14:40,378
That's done; I've moved on to other things.

344
00:14:40,446 --> 00:14:42,013
For example, after I learn Finnish,

345
00:14:42,081 --> 00:14:43,648
I'm not going to learn Finnish again.

346
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:47,051
Please, Sheldon, I'm a lost Indian boy

347
00:14:47,119 --> 00:14:49,954
far from home, and I want a girlfriend

348
00:14:50,022 --> 00:14:51,389
and I want her to be Abby,

349
00:14:51,457 --> 00:14:53,291
and she'll only come over
if she can bring Martha.

350
00:14:53,359 --> 00:14:56,294
Raj, I highly doubt there is
any argument you can make,

351
00:14:56,362 --> 00:14:59,564
threat you might levy, rhetorical strategy,

352
00:14:59,632 --> 00:15:01,165
plea, invocation,

353
00:15:01,233 --> 00:15:04,636
<i>supplication, or... vetoomus</i>

354
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:09,407
that you can employ that would
convince me to reconsider.

355
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:27,258
<i>My Incredible Hulk hands signed by Stan
Lee.</i>

356
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:30,061
Oh, my.

357
00:15:47,746 --> 00:15:50,371
I've admired these for years.

358
00:15:51,439 --> 00:15:53,240
So does that mean we can
go with the girls again?

359
00:15:53,307 --> 00:15:57,410
Hulk agree to second date with puny humans!

360
00:16:00,881 --> 00:16:03,183
You can't wear the hands on the date.

361
00:16:05,219 --> 00:16:08,488
Hulk sad.

362
00:16:10,825 --> 00:16:13,193
Hey.

363
00:16:14,162 --> 00:16:18,399
Cleaning out the old dryer lint, huh?

364
00:16:18,467 --> 00:16:19,900
Not only is it courteous,

365
00:16:19,968 --> 00:16:21,235
it's safety smart.

366
00:16:21,303 --> 00:16:23,271
Every year, 15,000 fires are caused

367
00:16:23,338 --> 00:16:27,208
by accidental dryer lint ignition.

368
00:16:27,276 --> 00:16:28,276
Now you're supposed to say,

369
00:16:28,343 --> 00:16:30,211
"Wow, what an interesting fact.

370
00:16:30,279 --> 00:16:32,313
"Come here, you crazy, nerdy guy.

371
00:16:32,381 --> 00:16:34,415
I could never be mad at you."

372
00:16:34,483 --> 00:16:36,984
Wow, that's all you got

373
00:16:37,052 --> 00:16:38,786
after you were the most obnoxious person

374
00:16:38,854 --> 00:16:42,790
on a double date that
included Howard Wolowitz?

375
00:16:44,192 --> 00:16:45,593
No, I'm sorry.

376
00:16:45,661 --> 00:16:47,261
I really am. It's not right

377
00:16:47,329 --> 00:16:50,197
to mock what a person believes in.

378
00:16:50,265 --> 00:16:51,399
Thank you.

379
00:16:51,466 --> 00:16:53,267
Would you be willing to go to my psychic

380
00:16:53,335 --> 00:16:54,869
and see what it's all about?

381
00:16:54,936 --> 00:16:56,504
Would you be willing to read a book

382
00:16:56,571 --> 00:16:59,373
that concisely explains how
all psychics are frauds?

383
00:16:59,441 --> 00:17:01,742
I would not.

384
00:17:06,548 --> 00:17:08,939
Okay, let's go see your psychic.

385
00:17:09,007 --> 00:17:10,074
Really?

386
00:17:10,141 --> 00:17:12,576
Well, yeah, one of us has
to keep an open mind.

387
00:17:12,644 --> 00:17:13,844
You saying I don't have an open mind?

388
00:17:13,912 --> 00:17:15,746
No, n-not at all.
Let me help you with this stuff.

389
00:17:15,814 --> 00:17:19,450
You know, I believe in ghosts, too.

390
00:17:19,517 --> 00:17:21,151
Great. And astrology.

391
00:17:21,219 --> 00:17:25,155
I know, and pyramid power
and healing crystals.

392
00:17:25,223 --> 00:17:28,659
Oh, no, no, no, crystals don't work.

393
00:17:28,727 --> 00:17:31,662
Really, that's the line?

394
00:17:31,730 --> 00:17:34,331
Psychics are real, but crystals are voodoo?

395
00:17:34,399 --> 00:17:35,666
Oh, voodoo's real.

396
00:17:35,734 --> 00:17:38,168
You don't want to mess with voodoo.

397
00:17:41,005 --> 00:17:43,640
<i>Flatland is more than just a
mathematical essay.</i>

398
00:17:43,708 --> 00:17:46,843
It is also a treatise on
Victorian social mores.

399
00:17:46,911 --> 00:17:48,812
You know, I had never considered that.

400
00:17:52,617 --> 00:17:54,551
Wow, that's going to

401
00:17:54,619 --> 00:17:56,853
completely change my visits there.

402
00:18:05,863 --> 00:18:08,098
Well, it's late.

403
00:18:08,166 --> 00:18:09,299
Uh-huh.

404
00:18:09,367 --> 00:18:10,867
Time for bed.

405
00:18:10,935 --> 00:18:14,104
Okay.

406
00:18:15,139 --> 00:18:17,507
Good night, puny human!

407
00:18:28,573 --> 00:18:31,041
Sheldon?

408
00:18:37,414 --> 00:18:38,348
Yes?

409
00:18:38,416 --> 00:18:39,751
Listen, they're kind of

410
00:18:40,819 --> 00:18:42,743
getting busy in the living room, and...

411
00:18:42,761 --> 00:18:45,663
I was wondering if I could
hang out in here for a while.

412
00:18:47,698 --> 00:18:49,632
Well, I suppose.

413
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:50,833
Come in.

414
00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:57,607
I'll sleep in Leonard's room.
Good night.

415
00:18:57,608 --> 00:19:07,608
