1
00:00:03,016 --> 00:00:05,452
I cannot believe you made
up your own game.

2
00:00:06,311 --> 00:00:08,966
"Research Lab" is more than a game.

3
00:00:09,447 --> 00:00:10,696
It's like the slogan says:

4
00:00:10,821 --> 00:00:13,794
"The physics is theoretical,
but the fun is real."

5
00:00:15,796 --> 00:00:17,809
We must not be playing it right.

6
00:00:19,529 --> 00:00:23,197
All right, five.
One, two, three, four, five.

7
00:00:24,035 --> 00:00:27,235
Look at that. My Department
of Defense research grant is renewed.

8
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:29,314
Great roll!

9
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:32,317
Now you can demolish
your Soviet-style cyclotron

10
00:00:32,442 --> 00:00:34,514
and build the large Hadron Collider.

11
00:00:38,024 --> 00:00:39,372
You're a natural at this.

12
00:00:39,618 --> 00:00:42,255
And as the first beta testers,
you two'll have quite the edge

13
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:44,668
when we play with Wolowitz
and Koothrappali on Sunday.

14
00:00:46,963 --> 00:00:49,215
I don't think we can play on Sunday.

15
00:00:49,503 --> 00:00:50,530
Why not?

16
00:00:50,865 --> 00:00:53,511
Because of the reasons
that Penny will now tell you.

17
00:00:55,062 --> 00:00:57,181
I have to pick up
my friend Justin from the airport.

18
00:00:57,351 --> 00:00:59,725
She has to pick up
her friend Justin at the airport.

19
00:00:59,895 --> 00:01:02,061
And I can't play
'cause I'm going with her... right?

20
00:01:03,294 --> 00:01:04,838
If you want.
There may not be room.

21
00:01:04,963 --> 00:01:07,650
He's got a lot of stuff...
like guitars and amplifiers...

22
00:01:08,183 --> 00:01:11,820
- Wait. What are you talking about?
- My friend Justin.

23
00:01:11,989 --> 00:01:14,240
Pay attention.
That's why she can't play on Sunday.

24
00:01:15,059 --> 00:01:16,575
- Who is this Justin?
- Your turn.

25
00:01:16,745 --> 00:01:19,245
- I told you about him.
- No, you didn't.

26
00:01:19,414 --> 00:01:23,143
My friend from Omaha, plays the guitar,
he's coming to LA looking for work,

27
00:01:23,268 --> 00:01:25,376
I told him he could crash
on my couch for a few weeks.

28
00:01:25,544 --> 00:01:28,860
Come on... if you roll a six, Penny
dies horribly in a nuclear meltdown.

29
00:01:30,974 --> 00:01:33,426
See what I mean
when I say the fun is real?

30
00:01:34,386 --> 00:01:37,138
Hang on. Some guy is going
to be sleeping on your couch?

31
00:01:37,589 --> 00:01:39,741
He's not "some guy." He's my friend.

32
00:01:40,076 --> 00:01:43,019
So by "friend,"
do you mean "friend friend,"

33
00:01:43,188 --> 00:01:46,046
"gay friend," or "ex-boyfriend
who you're now platonic with

34
00:01:46,171 --> 00:01:48,482
"but still might have a thing
for you friend"?

35
00:01:49,153 --> 00:01:51,277
Well, he's definitely not gay.

36
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:55,613
A definitely not gay musician
sleeping on my girlfriend's couch.

37
00:01:58,549 --> 00:02:00,620
We went out a little bit,
a long time ago.

38
00:02:00,789 --> 00:02:02,705
But we were never like "going out."

39
00:02:02,873 --> 00:02:05,120
Okay, not to be pedantic,
but last I checked

40
00:02:05,245 --> 00:02:07,627
"went out" was in fact the past
tense of "going out"...

41
00:02:07,795 --> 00:02:09,921
which I think we all know
is a popular euphemism

42
00:02:10,046 --> 00:02:11,723
for "saw each other naked."

43
00:02:13,552 --> 00:02:14,975
I'll just roll for you.

44
00:02:16,439 --> 00:02:18,512
Do you have a problem
with Justin staying with me?

45
00:02:18,773 --> 00:02:20,139
What was your first clue?

46
00:02:20,822 --> 00:02:22,691
Industrial accident.

47
00:02:24,153 --> 00:02:26,145
You know what?
Don't talk to me like I'm an idiot.

48
00:02:26,313 --> 00:02:29,565
I'm not talking to you like that!
I'm saying the whole idea is idiotic!

49
00:02:29,733 --> 00:02:31,845
"You accidentally stare
at a helium-argon laser.

50
00:02:31,970 --> 00:02:33,758
"Lose one turn and a retina."

51
00:02:34,891 --> 00:02:36,822
How is that not talking
to me like I'm an idiot?

52
00:02:36,992 --> 00:02:39,659
It's my friend, it's my couch,
and it's my freakin' life!

53
00:02:39,828 --> 00:02:41,138
It's also your roll.

54
00:02:42,045 --> 00:02:43,496
You know what?
It is your life.

55
00:02:43,664 --> 00:02:46,410
If you want to have some stupid
guitarist stay on your couch, then fine!

56
00:02:46,535 --> 00:02:50,294
Why don't you just rent some bunk beds
and invite The Black Eyed Peas?!

57
00:02:50,904 --> 00:02:53,290
If I want to invite
the entire lineup of Lollapalooza

58
00:02:53,415 --> 00:02:55,841
to sleep in my apartment, I will,
and it's none of your business!

59
00:02:56,011 --> 00:02:58,427
Are you listening to yourself?
Do you know how childish you sound?

60
00:02:58,645 --> 00:03:01,097
Now I'm a child?
Well, at least I'm not an idiot anymore!

61
00:03:01,321 --> 00:03:02,806
The two aren't mutually exclusive!

62
00:03:03,211 --> 00:03:04,474
You are such a...

63
00:03:04,983 --> 00:03:06,518
What the hell is he doing?!

64
00:03:06,688 --> 00:03:09,312
He's drowning us out.
He doesn't like fighting.

65
00:03:09,482 --> 00:03:11,365
Just stop!
Look, the fight is over!

66
00:03:12,085 --> 00:03:13,108
And FYI,

67
00:03:13,278 --> 00:03:15,902
you never even heard
of The Black Eyed Peas until you met me!

68
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:17,376
I heard of 'em!

69
00:03:19,174 --> 00:03:20,905
Didn't know they were a band.

70
00:03:22,858 --> 00:03:25,161
Sheldon, she's gone.
You can turn off the blender.

71
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:34,593
Has your relationship reached
its inevitable ugly end?

72
00:03:36,826 --> 00:03:39,259
No, we just had a little spat.

73
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:40,904
Look on the bright side.

74
00:03:41,029 --> 00:03:42,906
As the result of Penny's forfeit,

75
00:03:43,031 --> 00:03:46,496
you have become the world's
first winner of "Research Lab."

76
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:49,270
Would you like
a commemorative snow cone?

77
00:03:51,481 --> 00:03:54,567
Episode 307:
The Guitarist Amplification

78
00:03:54,735 --> 00:03:57,304
Sync: Jess, Linwelin, Loky

79
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:13,922
www.subbercafe.fr

80
00:04:19,836 --> 00:04:21,434
I don't get
how she can just announce

81
00:04:21,559 --> 00:04:23,845
that an old boyfriend is going
to be sleeping on her couch.

82
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:26,474
I thought of a game
we can play in the car.

83
00:04:26,685 --> 00:04:28,018
I don't want to play a game.

84
00:04:28,143 --> 00:04:31,270
It's called "Scientists."
Now, I will name three scientists,

85
00:04:31,438 --> 00:04:32,838
then you will put them in order

86
00:04:32,963 --> 00:04:35,315
of the size of their contribution
to their respective fields.

87
00:04:35,527 --> 00:04:37,453
To make this game
even more compelling,

88
00:04:37,578 --> 00:04:40,737
you must consider only the contribution
of the man to the field,

89
00:04:41,032 --> 00:04:43,105
not the validity
of the field itself.

90
00:04:43,230 --> 00:04:45,607
For example:
Abu Musa Jabir ibn Hayyan

91
00:04:45,732 --> 00:04:48,777
made a greater contribution
to the discredited field of alchemy

92
00:04:48,902 --> 00:04:51,129
than Halbert Vanderplatt
made to neurobiology.

93
00:04:51,254 --> 00:04:52,946
Okay, ready to have some fun?

94
00:04:54,671 --> 00:04:56,835
An old boyfriend
who's definitely not gay.

95
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:59,715
That's what a guy likes
to hear... "definitely."

96
00:04:59,926 --> 00:05:01,664
All right, I'll start
with an easy one:

97
00:05:02,473 --> 00:05:05,635
Isaac Newton, Madame Curie
and Niels Bohr.

98
00:05:06,391 --> 00:05:08,932
And then I say one little thing
and I end up being the bad guy!

99
00:05:09,144 --> 00:05:12,269
Hint: Madame Curie had
her husband to help her.

100
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,852
What am I supposed to say?

101
00:05:13,977 --> 00:05:16,273
"Sure, Penny, I'm cool
with your old boyfriend

102
00:05:16,443 --> 00:05:17,756
sleeping in your apartment."

103
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,943
"It doesn't
matter if you're cool or not

104
00:05:20,113 --> 00:05:23,195
"because I'm Penny and I'm pretty
and I can do whatever the hell I want!"

105
00:05:23,709 --> 00:05:27,432
"You think you're doing me a favor
by being in a relationship with me!"

106
00:05:27,557 --> 00:05:30,412
"I'm doing you a favor just by
being in the same room as you!"

107
00:05:30,623 --> 00:05:31,927
Leonard! Stop the car!

108
00:05:33,728 --> 00:05:34,652
What?

109
00:05:34,777 --> 00:05:37,085
I can't listen to the
two of you fight anymore.

110
00:05:42,448 --> 00:05:45,083
- Come on, we're late.
- Calm down. We'll make the movie.

111
00:05:45,208 --> 00:05:47,752
I believe my alarm is appropriate,
given the situation.

112
00:05:47,877 --> 00:05:49,280
The movie starts in 17 minutes.

113
00:05:49,405 --> 00:05:51,998
We'll need to make all the lights
on Colorado Boulevard,

114
00:05:52,123 --> 00:05:54,728
plus skip the concession stand,
and preshow urination.

115
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:59,668
Dude, I wish you had said something
before I pounded that last Red Bull.

116
00:06:00,887 --> 00:06:02,591
Go, go, Power Rangers, go!

117
00:06:08,003 --> 00:06:09,451
We're going to the movies.

118
00:06:09,707 --> 00:06:10,619
No, we're not.

119
00:06:11,915 --> 00:06:15,042
We're standing in the hallway,
suffering through an awkward encounter.

120
00:06:16,423 --> 00:06:17,500
Hang on.

121
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:20,345
They're showing a new digital
print of <i>Time Bandits</i>.

122
00:06:20,470 --> 00:06:23,089
- You wouldn't want to come, would you?
- Not really, no.

123
00:06:23,301 --> 00:06:26,458
Invitation pointlessly offered,
invitation declined as expected,

124
00:06:26,583 --> 00:06:29,272
everyone's civil, nobody's fighting.
Have a nice evening.

125
00:06:31,653 --> 00:06:33,253
Just give us a minute.

126
00:06:33,501 --> 00:06:35,177
Take all the time you need.

127
00:06:39,374 --> 00:06:41,734
So, are we going to talk
about last night?

128
00:06:42,214 --> 00:06:43,611
Are you ready to apologize?

129
00:06:44,905 --> 00:06:46,697
Wrong answer.
But thank you for playing.

130
00:06:48,217 --> 00:06:49,901
Come on.
This is stupid.

131
00:06:50,026 --> 00:06:52,036
There it is again!
You think I'm stupid!

132
00:06:52,204 --> 00:06:54,914
There's a difference between
being stupid and acting stupid!

133
00:06:55,082 --> 00:06:58,042
Well, there's a difference between
being a jerk and being an ass!

134
00:06:59,465 --> 00:07:01,692
No, there isn't!
They're synonyms!

135
00:07:04,656 --> 00:07:06,806
Well, that was rather unpleasant.

136
00:07:07,090 --> 00:07:10,440
Yeah, I don't think I need
my preshow urination anymore.

137
00:07:12,590 --> 00:07:15,512
When that woman moved in 3 years ago,
I told you not to talk to her,

138
00:07:15,637 --> 00:07:17,561
and now, we're going
to be late for the movies.

139
00:07:22,152 --> 00:07:25,068
Hey! Look! <i>Amazing Spider-Man</i> 183.

140
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:26,279
Got it.

141
00:07:27,531 --> 00:07:29,843
Remember this one?
Spider-Man loses a big fight

142
00:07:29,968 --> 00:07:32,242
and then his girlfriend
breaks up with him.

143
00:07:35,651 --> 00:07:39,291
Want me to get it for you?
It'll help take your mind off things.

144
00:07:39,756 --> 00:07:42,670
- Hey, guys. What's going on?
- We need to kill a couple hours

145
00:07:42,838 --> 00:07:44,616
till the next showing
of <i>Time Bandits</i>.

146
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:48,508
No problem, I was thinking
of closing early and going home, but...

147
00:07:48,947 --> 00:07:51,165
let's face it, that's just
a slightly smaller lonely room

148
00:07:51,290 --> 00:07:52,928
filled with comic books.

149
00:07:54,468 --> 00:07:55,718
Thanks, Stuart.

150
00:07:57,444 --> 00:07:59,654
Let me ask you something.
Do you think it's okay for Penny

151
00:07:59,779 --> 00:08:01,647
to have an ex-boyfriend sleep
on her couch?

152
00:08:01,815 --> 00:08:04,122
- She's obviously way out of line.
- Thank you!

153
00:08:04,526 --> 00:08:07,155
But if she dumps you, she'll have
a new boyfriend by tomorrow morning

154
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:10,489
and you'll have a new girlfriend
when you figure out how to build one.

155
00:08:12,844 --> 00:08:15,661
So the only question is:
how long until you fold?

156
00:08:16,156 --> 00:08:17,531
I am not going to fold.

157
00:08:17,656 --> 00:08:20,108
Well, excuse me, I don't think
Penny's out of line at all.

158
00:08:20,233 --> 00:08:21,558
You don't own her.

159
00:08:21,907 --> 00:08:23,406
It's like my girl Beyoncé says:

160
00:08:23,531 --> 00:08:26,027
"If you like it,
you shoulda put a ring on it."

161
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:31,207
At the very least, when she found out
Leonard was upset about it,

162
00:08:31,332 --> 00:08:32,720
she should've backed off.

163
00:08:32,888 --> 00:08:35,804
Like when a guy's upset cause his friend
agreed to take a cooking class with him

164
00:08:35,929 --> 00:08:39,476
and then doesn't show up because
he's doing a juice fast with his mother?

165
00:08:40,221 --> 00:08:42,072
I didn't know
you were upset about that.

166
00:08:42,197 --> 00:08:44,102
Really! Did you miss all
the subtle indicators,

167
00:08:44,227 --> 00:08:46,192
like me saying,
"Howard, I am upset."

168
00:08:46,549 --> 00:08:48,903
- Okay, sorry.
- Maybe it means something different.

169
00:08:49,071 --> 00:08:51,947
Back in India, it means
you're upset with a guy named Howard!

170
00:08:52,115 --> 00:08:54,845
- I said I'm sorry.
- Sorry doesn't make up for the fact

171
00:08:54,970 --> 00:08:57,409
that I had to make chicken
and rice with this vegan guy.

172
00:08:57,534 --> 00:08:59,721
Do you know
what vegan chicken and rice is?

173
00:08:59,846 --> 00:09:00,846
Rice!

174
00:09:01,785 --> 00:09:03,411
Well, you think I was having fun,

175
00:09:03,536 --> 00:09:05,571
sitting around all night
listening to my mother say,

176
00:09:05,696 --> 00:09:08,248
"Have you ever peed so much
in your life?"

177
00:09:09,007 --> 00:09:11,659
My God, you are such a mama's boy.

178
00:09:11,784 --> 00:09:15,345
- Hey, don't bring my mother into this!
- You brought your mother into this!

179
00:09:15,709 --> 00:09:16,931
Stop it, both of you!

180
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:20,097
All this fighting, I might as well
be back with my parents!

181
00:09:20,222 --> 00:09:22,911
"Damn it, George, I told you if you
didn't quit drinkin' I'd leave you!"

182
00:09:23,036 --> 00:09:24,693
"I guess that makes you a liar.

183
00:09:24,818 --> 00:09:26,732
"Cause I'm drunk as hell
and you're still here!"

184
00:09:27,222 --> 00:09:29,484
"Stop yelling!
You're making Sheldon cry!"

185
00:09:29,609 --> 00:09:31,348
"I'll tell you
what's making Sheldon cry!

186
00:09:31,473 --> 00:09:33,197
"That I let you name him Sheldon!"

187
00:09:40,535 --> 00:09:42,385
Boy, what got him so upset?

188
00:09:43,476 --> 00:09:46,226
Oh, sure, you can tell
when Sheldon's upset.

189
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:56,136
Thank you very much.
Come back soon.

190
00:09:57,231 --> 00:09:59,245
With the other half of my tip.

191
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:04,353
Hey, Sheldon.
What are you doing here?

192
00:10:04,562 --> 00:10:06,564
This is a restaurant.
It's lunchtime.

193
00:10:06,689 --> 00:10:09,524
I would think, as a waitress,
you'd be familiar with the paradigm.

194
00:10:10,127 --> 00:10:11,374
Is Leonard coming?

195
00:10:11,863 --> 00:10:15,405
I believe he is waiting for you to come
crawling back to him and apologize.

196
00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:18,304
- That's not gonna happen.
- I assumed that would be your attitude.

197
00:10:18,429 --> 00:10:20,494
- Hence, my true purpose in coming here.
- Which is?

198
00:10:20,662 --> 00:10:23,205
I want you to crawl back to him
and apologize.

199
00:10:23,587 --> 00:10:24,758
I'm busy.

200
00:10:24,883 --> 00:10:26,240
Excuse me, miss.

201
00:10:26,365 --> 00:10:28,080
I'd like to order lunch.

202
00:10:32,501 --> 00:10:34,967
- Fine. What do you want?
- I have a few questions.

203
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:38,011
First, I notice that you offer
soup and a half-sandwich?

204
00:10:38,837 --> 00:10:41,693
Where exactly does
the half-sandwich come from?

205
00:10:42,017 --> 00:10:44,226
Are you giving me half
of someone else's sandwich,

206
00:10:44,942 --> 00:10:48,077
or do I have to wait for someone else
to order the other half?

207
00:10:48,483 --> 00:10:50,565
No, Sheldon,
they just make a half-sandwich.

208
00:10:50,734 --> 00:10:52,442
You can't make a half-sandwich.

209
00:10:52,612 --> 00:10:56,113
If it's not half of a whole sandwich,
it's just a small sandwich.

210
00:10:56,629 --> 00:10:59,700
Fine, it's soup and a small sandwich.
Is that what you want?

211
00:10:59,868 --> 00:11:01,967
Of course not. I'll have my usual.

212
00:11:02,977 --> 00:11:03,700
Great.

213
00:11:03,825 --> 00:11:05,789
Aren't you going to ask me
if I want a beverage?

214
00:11:06,127 --> 00:11:07,564
Don't you usually get lemonade?

215
00:11:07,689 --> 00:11:08,876
Do you want lemonade?

216
00:11:09,087 --> 00:11:11,503
- Anything else?
- I want you to apologize to Leonard.

217
00:11:12,961 --> 00:11:15,293
I am not going to apologize.
I've done nothing wrong.

218
00:11:15,418 --> 00:11:17,318
- He is completely overreacting.
- Irrelevant.

219
00:11:17,443 --> 00:11:20,629
The disruption in your relationship
is making my life intolerable.

220
00:11:21,014 --> 00:11:23,724
Well, I'm sorry, Sheldon,
but this really isn't about you.

221
00:11:24,694 --> 00:11:25,944
I don't follow.

222
00:11:27,512 --> 00:11:30,022
Yeah, yeah, I'll be right there.
Look, Sheldon, I have to go.

223
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:33,859
All right, let's assume, <i>ad argumentum</i>,
that in this case, Leonard is wrong.

224
00:11:34,027 --> 00:11:35,402
Leonard is wrong.

225
00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:38,694
Considering the number of transgressions
you've committed that he's overlooked,

226
00:11:38,819 --> 00:11:41,241
don't you think that, just this once,
you could return the favor?

227
00:11:41,981 --> 00:11:43,493
I'm coming. Good-bye, Sheldon.

228
00:11:48,507 --> 00:11:50,906
What do you mean,
transgressions I've committed?

229
00:11:51,631 --> 00:11:54,546
Were you under the impression
Leonard has no complaints about you?

230
00:11:54,716 --> 00:11:55,846
Like what?!

231
00:11:55,971 --> 00:11:58,204
I see you, you're making
a little check sign in the air.

232
00:11:58,329 --> 00:11:59,663
Just hold your horses.

233
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:03,472
- What does Leonard complain about?
- Your driving.

234
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:05,454
The plethora
of stuffed animals on your bed

235
00:12:05,579 --> 00:12:07,934
that stare at him
during your amorous activities.

236
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:11,813
Your constant tardiness,
your singing.

237
00:12:11,983 --> 00:12:13,858
- My singing?
- That's actually from my list.

238
00:12:13,983 --> 00:12:16,151
But Leonard would be a fool
if he didn't agree with it.

239
00:12:16,846 --> 00:12:19,619
If Leonard has so many problems with me,
why hasn't he just said so?

240
00:12:19,744 --> 00:12:22,240
Because, according to him,
you're oversensitive and have a temper.

241
00:12:22,972 --> 00:12:24,826
Oh, really?
Well, then, do me a favor

242
00:12:24,996 --> 00:12:27,244
and tell Leonard
that he can drop dead!

243
00:12:31,502 --> 00:12:34,043
And she wonders
why she's constantly undertipped.

244
00:12:39,697 --> 00:12:40,881
Good, you're home.

245
00:12:41,006 --> 00:12:42,775
- I need you to do me a favor.
- Sure.

246
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:44,500
Go apologize to Penny.

247
00:12:45,509 --> 00:12:47,476
- What?!
- Right now would be good.

248
00:12:49,006 --> 00:12:51,186
Although, a few minutes ago
would have been better.

249
00:12:52,026 --> 00:12:55,983
Seems you don't like my stuffed animals,
my driving or my punctuality.

250
00:12:56,244 --> 00:12:58,318
What? Who would tell you
something like that?

251
00:12:58,488 --> 00:13:00,654
Why would you tell her
something like that?

252
00:13:00,948 --> 00:13:03,323
It doesn't matter why he told me.
It's true, isn't it?

253
00:13:03,802 --> 00:13:06,279
Yeah, it's true,
but I can live with that stuff.

254
00:13:06,404 --> 00:13:08,589
What I can't live with is
you casually informing me

255
00:13:08,714 --> 00:13:11,665
that a guy's staying in your apartment
without even asking me first!

256
00:13:12,049 --> 00:13:15,095
That isn't your problem!
Your problem is you don't trust me!

257
00:13:16,129 --> 00:13:19,339
Sheldon, have you ever once heard me say
that I don't trust Penny?

258
00:13:19,587 --> 00:13:21,466
Sheldon?
Where did he go?

259
00:13:22,270 --> 00:13:24,669
Your yelling must have
freaked him out again.

260
00:13:24,794 --> 00:13:27,681
Where are you going?! You walk away
in the middle of an argument?!

261
00:13:27,849 --> 00:13:29,868
I'm gonna find your roommate
before he hurts himself

262
00:13:29,993 --> 00:13:31,518
trying to cross the street!

263
00:13:32,387 --> 00:13:33,690
Why didn't you say so?

264
00:13:33,815 --> 00:13:35,801
Now I need your permission
for that, too?!

265
00:13:35,926 --> 00:13:37,652
I can't read your mind, Penny!

266
00:13:37,777 --> 00:13:40,298
Really? Why not?
You're so smart, and I'm so dumb!

267
00:13:47,689 --> 00:13:49,467
Stop knocking!
It's open!

268
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:52,581
Tell my parents that
our dark matter research

269
00:13:52,749 --> 00:13:53,994
is at a critical juncture,

270
00:13:54,119 --> 00:13:56,042
and I can't come home
for my cousin wedding.

271
00:13:57,337 --> 00:13:59,773
<i>Ask our son what we're supposed to say
to Mr. and Mrs. Cheldry,</i>

272
00:13:59,898 --> 00:14:01,849
<i>whose daughter, Lakshmi
is flying in from London,</i>

273
00:14:01,974 --> 00:14:03,650
<i>for the sole purpose of meeting him.</i>

274
00:14:03,886 --> 00:14:05,594
I didn't ask you
to set me up with her.

275
00:14:05,763 --> 00:14:07,517
<i>- You should be thanking us!
- Yes.</i>

276
00:14:07,642 --> 00:14:09,723
<i>Lakshmi just got
her stomach stapled.</i>

277
00:14:11,309 --> 00:14:13,192
<i>You have an opportunity
to get in good with her</i>

278
00:14:13,317 --> 00:14:15,687
<i>before she loses weight,
and her self-esteem goes up.</i>

279
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:17,147
I don't care!

280
00:14:17,477 --> 00:14:19,775
And why don't you think I can find
a woman for myself?

281
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:22,715
<i>Because you're 27, and the closest thing
we have to a daughter-in-law</i>

282
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:24,640
<i>is that Jewish boy Howard.</i>

283
00:14:25,593 --> 00:14:27,959
That is completely below the belt.

284
00:14:28,084 --> 00:14:31,084
Sheldon, tell my parents
that Howard and I are just friends.

285
00:14:33,461 --> 00:14:35,461
Howard and I are just friends!

286
00:14:39,275 --> 00:14:41,375
Fine. I'll come home
for Sanjay's wedding.

287
00:14:50,372 --> 00:14:52,766
What are you doing?
He's not a lost dog.

288
00:14:53,462 --> 00:14:55,156
Why don't you just let me find him

289
00:14:55,281 --> 00:14:57,268
while you sit there
hitting your imaginary brake?

290
00:14:58,209 --> 00:15:01,728
The brake might be imaginary,
but that stop sign you just ran wasn't.

291
00:15:01,853 --> 00:15:02,900
What stop sign?

292
00:15:03,025 --> 00:15:04,775
Eyes on the road.
Eyes on the road!

293
00:15:14,861 --> 00:15:18,382
<i>Howard, answer the door!
I'm busy!</i>

294
00:15:18,950 --> 00:15:21,389
<i>I'm busy, too!
You answer it.</i>

295
00:15:21,514 --> 00:15:23,922
<i>I can't! I'm on the toilet!</i>

296
00:15:24,966 --> 00:15:26,857
<i>For God's sake,
I don't need to hear that!</i>

297
00:15:26,982 --> 00:15:29,032
<i>Can't you just say, "I'm busy"?</i>

298
00:15:29,332 --> 00:15:32,848
<i>I said I'm busy,
but that wasn't good enough for you!</i>

299
00:15:33,237 --> 00:15:35,520
<i>I hope it's one of those
home invasion deals,</i>

300
00:15:35,645 --> 00:15:37,242
<i>and they shoot me in the head!</i>

301
00:15:37,832 --> 00:15:41,740
<i>Well, if it's a home invader,
don't tell them I'm on the toilet!</i>

302
00:15:46,333 --> 00:15:47,883
There's no one there.

303
00:15:48,348 --> 00:15:50,494
<i>You're hearing things,
you crazy old lady!</i>

304
00:15:54,708 --> 00:15:56,458
Stuart, have you seen Sheldon?

305
00:15:56,584 --> 00:15:59,291
Yeah, he's over in
the graphic novel section.

306
00:16:01,211 --> 00:16:03,086
Built himself a little nest.

307
00:16:03,869 --> 00:16:04,869
Thank you.

308
00:16:07,516 --> 00:16:09,467
- Is everything okay?
- What do you mean?

309
00:16:10,022 --> 00:16:12,095
Sheldon told me
you and Leonard were having a fight?

310
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:15,457
Yeah, kind of.
It's no big thing.

311
00:16:15,582 --> 00:16:16,582
Good, good.

312
00:16:17,672 --> 00:16:18,722
I love you.

313
00:16:20,563 --> 00:16:22,939
I'm not leaving
until you talk to me.

314
00:16:23,108 --> 00:16:25,630
- What's going on?
- It's a little hard to explain.

315
00:16:25,755 --> 00:16:28,592
He does this thing where he pretends
he's in an alternate dimension

316
00:16:28,717 --> 00:16:30,845
that occupies the
same physical space we're in,

317
00:16:30,970 --> 00:16:32,720
but he can't perceive us.

318
00:16:34,457 --> 00:16:37,307
Don't flatter yourself.
I'm just ignoring you.

319
00:16:39,328 --> 00:16:42,080
Come on, Sheldon, let's go home.
Look, we're done fighting.

320
00:16:42,252 --> 00:16:43,659
I've heard that before.

321
00:16:43,877 --> 00:16:46,143
But then, the next thing you know,
I'm hiding in my bedroom,

322
00:16:46,268 --> 00:16:48,147
blaring a Richard Feynman lecture

323
00:16:48,272 --> 00:16:50,345
while my mom is shouting
that Jesus would forgive her

324
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:52,665
if she put ground glass
in my dad's meatloaf.

325
00:16:54,128 --> 00:16:57,930
And my dad's on the roof skeet-shooting
her Franklin Mint collectible plates.

326
00:16:59,785 --> 00:17:02,854
There's going to be no more shouting
and no skeet-shooting.

327
00:17:03,138 --> 00:17:05,899
Really?
Where's your friend Justin gonna sleep?

328
00:17:06,827 --> 00:17:08,499
Yeah... where's he gonna sleep?

329
00:17:08,624 --> 00:17:10,528
Oh, my God, would you let this go?!

330
00:17:10,698 --> 00:17:11,896
I'd let it go.

331
00:17:14,098 --> 00:17:15,266
Why should I let it go?

332
00:17:15,391 --> 00:17:17,577
Why don't you just tell the guy
to find another place?!

333
00:17:19,497 --> 00:17:20,997
Oh, for God's sakes.

334
00:17:23,331 --> 00:17:25,205
So, you have childhood issues.

335
00:17:25,330 --> 00:17:27,174
We all have childhood issues.

336
00:17:27,299 --> 00:17:29,881
At some point, you just need
to grow up and get past them.

337
00:17:30,161 --> 00:17:31,174
<i>Fire! Fire!</i>

338
00:17:32,506 --> 00:17:34,219
Will you just let me
handle this, please?

339
00:17:44,374 --> 00:17:46,153
Please, try and understand.

340
00:17:46,278 --> 00:17:49,734
Leonard and I are in a relationship,
and occasionally, we're going to fight.

341
00:17:50,343 --> 00:17:53,635
But no matter what happens between us,
we will always love you.

342
00:17:56,206 --> 00:17:57,409
Right, Leonard?

343
00:17:58,149 --> 00:17:59,749
Always is a long time.

344
00:18:02,204 --> 00:18:03,354
Sure. Always.

345
00:18:04,359 --> 00:18:07,280
How about we buy you this robot,
and then we all go home?

346
00:18:09,268 --> 00:18:10,568
I want that one.

347
00:18:11,811 --> 00:18:13,174
Okay, you can have that one.

348
00:18:13,597 --> 00:18:16,067
Come on, he's just going
to play with it twice,

349
00:18:16,192 --> 00:18:19,114
and then it'll end up in his closet
with all the other junk.

350
00:18:20,391 --> 00:18:21,599
Buy him the robot.

351
00:18:23,771 --> 00:18:25,519
Can I get this comic book, too?

352
00:18:25,855 --> 00:18:26,855
Yes, you can.

353
00:18:33,195 --> 00:18:34,195
We meet again.

354
00:18:43,001 --> 00:18:44,614
What did Justin say
when you told him

355
00:18:44,739 --> 00:18:46,385
he couldn't sleep on your couch?

356
00:18:46,510 --> 00:18:47,564
He's a musician.

357
00:18:47,689 --> 00:18:50,100
He'll sleep in his own vomit,
if he has to.

358
00:18:59,411 --> 00:19:03,000
I should have asked for much more
than a comic book and a robot.
