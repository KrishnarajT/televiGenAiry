1
00:00:02,256 --> 00:00:03,795
Check this out.

2
00:00:08,657 --> 00:00:10,343
Leonard, she's doing it again.

3
00:00:11,319 --> 00:00:13,971
I think it upsets Sheldon
when you play with the food.

4
00:00:15,192 --> 00:00:17,318
It upsets Sheldon
when she willy-nilly takes it

5
00:00:17,443 --> 00:00:20,353
from the containers without regard
for its equitable distribution.

6
00:00:21,503 --> 00:00:24,042
This is essentially
why you have famine in India.

7
00:00:26,664 --> 00:00:28,406
You want me to put it back?

8
00:00:30,907 --> 00:00:33,538
It upsets Sheldon
when you play with the Sheldon.

9
00:00:36,382 --> 00:00:38,036
What's up, my nerd dizzles?

10
00:00:40,582 --> 00:00:42,375
I want you to meet
my girlfriend Bernadette.

11
00:00:43,544 --> 00:00:45,127
You know my girlfriend Bernadette.

12
00:00:46,672 --> 00:00:48,396
Say fo'shizzle to my nerdizzles.

13
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:51,154
I don't think I can.

14
00:00:52,535 --> 00:00:54,412
I don't have Howard's street cred.

15
00:00:56,424 --> 00:00:59,550
I told my girlfriend Bernadette
she could join us for dinner.

16
00:00:59,675 --> 00:01:03,068
- Sure. The more, the merrier.
- Wa... no, that's a false equivalency.

17
00:01:03,193 --> 00:01:04,647
More does not equal merry.

18
00:01:04,816 --> 00:01:07,012
If there were 2,000 people
in this apartment right now,

19
00:01:07,137 --> 00:01:09,735
would we be celebrating?
No, we'd be suffocating.

20
00:01:11,031 --> 00:01:13,238
Don't "Sheldon" me.
We ordered for five people, not six.

21
00:01:13,408 --> 00:01:16,404
It's fine. We'll just put it all
on the table, you know, family style.

22
00:01:16,529 --> 00:01:19,313
Sure. And while we're at it, why don't
we put our hands behind our backs,

23
00:01:19,438 --> 00:01:21,789
have an old-fashioned
eating contest?

24
00:01:22,503 --> 00:01:24,208
Relax, it'll be fine.
Sit down, you guys.

25
00:01:27,835 --> 00:01:28,555
What?!

26
00:01:30,868 --> 00:01:32,425
Oh, yeah, you can't sit there.

27
00:01:32,594 --> 00:01:34,886
- Why not?
- That's where Sheldon sits.

28
00:01:35,077 --> 00:01:36,387
He can't sit somewhere else?

29
00:01:38,141 --> 00:01:39,379
In the winter,

30
00:01:39,504 --> 00:01:41,844
that seat is close enough
to the radiator so that he's warm,

31
00:01:41,969 --> 00:01:43,394
yet not so close that he sweats.

32
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:45,830
In the summer, it's directly
in the path of a cross-breeze

33
00:01:45,955 --> 00:01:47,803
created by
opening windows there and there.

34
00:01:47,928 --> 00:01:50,020
It faces the television
at an angle that isn't direct,

35
00:01:50,145 --> 00:01:51,489
so he can talk to everybody,

36
00:01:51,614 --> 00:01:54,107
yet not so wide
that the picture looks distorted.

37
00:01:58,383 --> 00:02:00,582
Perhaps there's hope
for you after all.

38
00:02:02,957 --> 00:02:05,138
Episode 310:
The Gorilla Experiment

39
00:02:06,852 --> 00:02:08,096
Sync: Jess, Lin

40
00:02:23,018 --> 00:02:25,517
www.subbercafe.fr

41
00:02:28,463 --> 00:02:29,527
I love your shoes.

42
00:02:29,652 --> 00:02:31,440
Oh, thanks.
They are cute, aren't they?

43
00:02:31,652 --> 00:02:33,361
Where'd you get them?
Shoes for Less.

44
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:37,226
- I've been meaning to go over there.
- Oh, great selection, great prices.

45
00:02:38,403 --> 00:02:40,387
My mother was right.
Hell is real.

46
00:02:42,276 --> 00:02:45,040
Come on, Sheldon.
Let the womenfolk chat.

47
00:02:48,153 --> 00:02:48,960
Womenfolk?

48
00:02:49,905 --> 00:02:51,185
Gals?
Chicks?

49
00:02:51,846 --> 00:02:53,123
Utero-Americans?

50
00:02:55,525 --> 00:02:56,927
Just eat your dinner.

51
00:02:57,096 --> 00:02:58,711
Don't take him too seriously.

52
00:02:58,836 --> 00:03:01,239
A lot of what he says
is intended as humor.

53
00:03:02,902 --> 00:03:04,684
I don't think it's very funny.

54
00:03:05,127 --> 00:03:07,710
Me neither,
but he just lights up when I laugh.

55
00:03:11,167 --> 00:03:12,804
Never let her go.

56
00:03:15,338 --> 00:03:18,864
Howard says you're working on
fundamental tests of quantum mechanics.

57
00:03:19,359 --> 00:03:21,408
I am.
Are you interested in physics?

58
00:03:21,577 --> 00:03:22,786
I find it fascinating.

59
00:03:23,314 --> 00:03:25,021
If I hadn't gone into microbiology,

60
00:03:25,146 --> 00:03:27,284
I probably would have
gone into physics.

61
00:03:27,409 --> 00:03:28,611
Or ice dancing.

62
00:03:30,337 --> 00:03:32,018
Actually, my tests
of the Aharonov-Bohm

63
00:03:32,143 --> 00:03:34,525
quantum interference effect
have reached an interesting point.

64
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:37,466
Right now, we're testing the phase
shift due to an electric potential.

65
00:03:37,635 --> 00:03:38,593
That's amazing.

66
00:03:40,012 --> 00:03:41,691
Leonard's work is nearly as amazing

67
00:03:41,816 --> 00:03:45,045
as third graders growing
lima beans in wet paper towels.

68
00:03:47,089 --> 00:03:49,354
While I appreciate the "Oh, snap,"

69
00:03:49,523 --> 00:03:52,207
I'm uncomfortable having
your moist breath in my ear.

70
00:03:56,660 --> 00:03:59,531
Are you going to try to set up
the voltages using tunnel junctions?

71
00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:01,730
Yes, I am.

72
00:04:01,855 --> 00:04:03,618
You want to see a simulation
on my laptop?

73
00:04:03,861 --> 00:04:05,161
Oh, yeah, show me.

74
00:04:05,775 --> 00:04:09,204
In microbiology, the most exciting
thing I get to work with is yeast.

75
00:04:12,754 --> 00:04:14,367
Your shoes are delightful.

76
00:04:18,029 --> 00:04:19,425
Where did you get them?

77
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:22,877
- What?
- Bazinga. I don't care.

78
00:04:31,589 --> 00:04:32,772
Eat my dust,

79
00:04:32,962 --> 00:04:34,841
racially stereotypical plumber.

80
00:04:38,838 --> 00:04:41,239
That's not fair.
I got stuck behind a tree.

81
00:04:41,587 --> 00:04:43,158
And a cow and a penguin.

82
00:04:44,323 --> 00:04:45,076
Face it,

83
00:04:45,276 --> 00:04:47,831
dude, whether it's a real car
or a virtual cartoon car,

84
00:04:47,956 --> 00:04:49,082
you can't drive.

85
00:04:50,041 --> 00:04:51,623
Just need a little more practice.

86
00:04:51,793 --> 00:04:54,962
What you need is cheat codes,
motor skills and a magic genie

87
00:04:55,087 --> 00:04:58,162
who grants wishes to little boys
who suck at Mario Kart.

88
00:05:01,899 --> 00:05:03,636
Can I talk to you for a second?

89
00:05:03,805 --> 00:05:05,458
It's not about shoes, is it?

90
00:05:06,624 --> 00:05:08,433
I don't think I could go
through that again.

91
00:05:08,823 --> 00:05:09,934
It's not about shoes.

92
00:05:10,103 --> 00:05:11,086
Then speak.

93
00:05:12,247 --> 00:05:13,980
Actually, can we do it in private?

94
00:05:14,149 --> 00:05:15,089
All right.

95
00:05:15,963 --> 00:05:16,963
Go away.

96
00:05:19,153 --> 00:05:21,506
I agree, it's rude,
but she asked for privacy.

97
00:05:23,152 --> 00:05:23,907
Thanks.

98
00:05:24,757 --> 00:05:26,424
Okay, so here's the thing:

99
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:30,330
I was wondering if you could
maybe teach me a little physics?

100
00:05:31,313 --> 00:05:33,041
A little physics?

101
00:05:33,977 --> 00:05:35,148
There's no such thing.

102
00:05:35,273 --> 00:05:37,456
Physics encompasses
the entire universe,

103
00:05:37,581 --> 00:05:40,025
from quantum particles
to supernovas,

104
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:43,088
from spinning electrons
to spinning galaxies.

105
00:05:43,469 --> 00:05:45,552
Yeah, okay, cool.
I don't need the PBS special.

106
00:05:46,649 --> 00:05:49,251
I just want to know enough
so I can talk to Leonard about his job.

107
00:05:49,376 --> 00:05:50,859
You know, like Bernadette does.

108
00:05:50,984 --> 00:05:53,645
- Why can't Leonard teach you?
- 'Cause I want to surprise him.

109
00:05:53,942 --> 00:05:55,650
Can't you surprise him
in some other way?

110
00:05:55,775 --> 00:05:57,774
I'm sure
he'd be delightfully taken aback

111
00:05:57,899 --> 00:05:59,588
if you cleaned your apartment.

112
00:06:01,338 --> 00:06:03,148
Come on, this is important to me.

113
00:06:03,948 --> 00:06:07,905
This would be a massive undertaking,
and my time is limited and valuable.

114
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:10,537
You're sitting here
playing video games all day.

115
00:06:12,003 --> 00:06:13,081
Okay, point.

116
00:06:14,876 --> 00:06:16,590
What sort of foundation do you have?

117
00:06:16,715 --> 00:06:18,878
Did you take any science
classes in school?

118
00:06:19,046 --> 00:06:21,047
Sure.
I did the one with the frogs.

119
00:06:24,276 --> 00:06:26,063
The one with the frogs.

120
00:06:27,054 --> 00:06:28,560
Actually, it was pretty cool.

121
00:06:28,685 --> 00:06:31,391
A lot of the girls threw up,
but I gutted that thing like a deer.

122
00:06:32,638 --> 00:06:34,410
I'm sorry, Penny. I don't think so.

123
00:06:34,578 --> 00:06:37,506
Come on! A smart guy like you,
it'll be a challenge.

124
00:06:37,631 --> 00:06:39,881
You can make it like an experiment.

125
00:06:41,438 --> 00:06:42,538
Interesting.

126
00:06:43,433 --> 00:06:45,492
I suppose if someone
could teach sign language

127
00:06:45,617 --> 00:06:47,217
to KoKo the gorilla...

128
00:06:48,741 --> 00:06:50,910
I could teach you
some rudimentary physics.

129
00:06:51,111 --> 00:06:51,920
Great!

130
00:06:52,045 --> 00:06:54,231
It's a little insulting, but great.

131
00:06:54,356 --> 00:06:56,226
- I'll be KoKo.
- Not likely.

132
00:06:56,351 --> 00:06:58,383
KoKo learned to understand
over 2,000 words,

133
00:06:58,508 --> 00:07:00,962
not one of which had
anything to do with shoes.

134
00:07:03,902 --> 00:07:06,380
Hey, fellas.
This is my girlfriend Bernadette.

135
00:07:07,271 --> 00:07:09,021
My girlfriend Bernadette.

136
00:07:10,015 --> 00:07:12,098
- Who are all those people?
- Have no idea.

137
00:07:15,728 --> 00:07:18,229
Look, it's Howard
and his girlfriend Bernadette.

138
00:07:18,564 --> 00:07:21,733
Thought I'd give the little woman
a tour of the old salt mines.

139
00:07:22,633 --> 00:07:24,370
He doesn't mean salt mines.

140
00:07:24,495 --> 00:07:26,331
He means where he works.

141
00:07:28,486 --> 00:07:29,936
Yeah, no, I got it.

142
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,244
So, how's your experiment going?

143
00:07:33,418 --> 00:07:35,924
Terrific, we're getting
the electron accelerator set up.

144
00:07:36,049 --> 00:07:37,916
We should be ready to go
day after tomorrow.

145
00:07:38,222 --> 00:07:41,002
- Boy, I'd love to see that.
- You're welcome to come.

146
00:07:41,466 --> 00:07:43,171
Really?
Oh, that'd be great.

147
00:07:43,525 --> 00:07:44,964
How exciting is that?

148
00:07:45,132 --> 00:07:46,732
Like Hanukkah in July.

149
00:07:48,643 --> 00:07:49,886
Do they have that?

150
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:56,170
You got me again.

151
00:07:59,188 --> 00:08:00,988
This isn't non-fat yogurt.

152
00:08:01,195 --> 00:08:02,440
This is fatty fat fat.

153
00:08:03,363 --> 00:08:04,371
Excuse me.

154
00:08:04,985 --> 00:08:06,571
Could you grab me a napkin, sweetie?

155
00:08:06,696 --> 00:08:08,196
- Sure.
- Thanks, honey.

156
00:08:09,670 --> 00:08:11,574
All right, what is your deal?

157
00:08:12,123 --> 00:08:12,951
Excuse me?

158
00:08:13,119 --> 00:08:16,704
Inviting my girlfriend to come see
your electron accelerator?

159
00:08:17,099 --> 00:08:18,373
Yeah? So?

160
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:22,899
You really are a piece of work.

161
00:08:23,687 --> 00:08:25,384
It's not enough
you get the prom queen,

162
00:08:25,509 --> 00:08:28,299
you have to get the head
of the decorating committee, too?

163
00:08:28,954 --> 00:08:32,122
- What are you talking about?
- Don't play innocent with me.

164
00:08:32,247 --> 00:08:33,508
I practically invented

165
00:08:33,633 --> 00:08:36,160
using fancy lab equipment
to seduce women.

166
00:08:37,812 --> 00:08:38,893
Has it ever worked?

167
00:08:39,312 --> 00:08:41,712
Not so far,
but that's not the point!

168
00:08:42,606 --> 00:08:45,191
Relax, I'm not interested
in your girlfriend.

169
00:08:45,675 --> 00:08:46,675
I hope not.

170
00:08:46,923 --> 00:08:48,962
Because you don't
want to mess with me.

171
00:08:54,901 --> 00:08:55,901
I'm crazy.

172
00:08:58,956 --> 00:09:00,156
I believe you.

00:09:10,741 --> 00:09:12,388
<i>teaching Penny physics.</i>

177
00:09:14,405 --> 00:09:16,859
<i>I'm calling it Project Gorilla.</i>

178
00:09:19,486 --> 00:09:20,435
Hey, Sheldon.

179
00:09:20,603 --> 00:09:22,061
Come in. Take a seat.

180
00:09:23,272 --> 00:09:24,772
<i>Subject has arrived.</i>

181
00:09:25,852 --> 00:09:28,452
<i>I've extended
a friendly casual greeting.</i>

182
00:09:29,159 --> 00:09:30,445
Ready to get started?

183
00:09:30,718 --> 00:09:31,718
One moment.

184
00:09:36,148 --> 00:09:38,948
<i>Subject appears well-rested
and enthusiastic.</i>

185
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:42,628
<i>Apparently, ignorance is bliss.</i>

186
00:09:45,272 --> 00:09:47,206
All right, let us begin.

187
00:09:48,831 --> 00:09:50,048
Where's your notebook?

188
00:09:51,135 --> 00:09:52,133
I don't have one.

189
00:09:52,301 --> 00:09:54,594
How are you going to take notes
without a notebook?

190
00:09:54,762 --> 00:09:55,988
I have to take notes?

191
00:09:56,113 --> 00:09:58,806
How else are you
gonna study for the tests?

192
00:09:58,974 --> 00:10:00,183
There's gonna be a test?

193
00:10:01,232 --> 00:10:02,232
Test-sss.

194
00:10:04,897 --> 00:10:05,926
Here.

195
00:10:06,273 --> 00:10:08,941
It's college-ruled.
I hope that's not too intimidating.

196
00:10:12,226 --> 00:10:13,071
Thank you.

197
00:10:13,239 --> 00:10:15,948
You're welcome.
Now, Introduction to Physics.

198
00:10:16,899 --> 00:10:18,529
What is physics?

199
00:10:19,067 --> 00:10:22,789
Physics comes
from the ancient Greek word "physika. "

200
00:10:25,084 --> 00:10:27,210
It's at this point
you'll want to start taking notes.

201
00:10:29,077 --> 00:10:32,682
"Physika" means the science
of natural things.

202
00:10:32,807 --> 00:10:36,677
And it is there, in ancient Greece,
that our story begins.

203
00:10:37,237 --> 00:10:38,304
Ancient Greece?!

204
00:10:38,472 --> 00:10:40,348
Hush. If you have questions,
raise your hand.

205
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:45,144
It's a warm summer evening,
circa 600 BC.

206
00:10:45,312 --> 00:10:49,190
You've finished your shopping
at the local market, or agora...

207
00:10:53,274 --> 00:10:55,209
and you look up at the night sky.

208
00:10:55,334 --> 00:10:58,764
There you notice
some of the stars seem to move,

209
00:10:58,889 --> 00:11:01,572
so you name them "planetes,"

210
00:11:01,697 --> 00:11:03,118
or "wanderer. "

211
00:11:11,307 --> 00:11:13,840
Does this have anything to do
with Leonard's work?

212
00:11:14,386 --> 00:11:17,172
This is the beginning
of a 2,600-year journey

213
00:11:17,297 --> 00:11:19,220
we're going to take together from...

214
00:11:20,681 --> 00:11:21,854
the ancient Greeks

215
00:11:21,979 --> 00:11:24,100
through Isaac Newton to Niels Bohr

216
00:11:24,535 --> 00:11:25,810
to Erwin Schrodinger

217
00:11:25,978 --> 00:11:29,480
to the Dutch researchers
that Leonard is currently ripping off.

218
00:11:31,477 --> 00:11:33,067
2,600 years?

219
00:11:33,235 --> 00:11:34,125
Give or take.

220
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:36,642
As I was saying,
it's a warm summer evening

221
00:11:36,767 --> 00:11:38,267
in ancient Greece...

222
00:11:40,242 --> 00:11:41,868
I have to go to the bathroom.

223
00:11:42,257 --> 00:11:44,882
- Can't you hold it?
- Not for 2,600 years.

224
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:57,398
<i>Project Gorilla, entry two.</i>

225
00:11:58,358 --> 00:11:59,844
<i>I am exhausted.</i>

226
00:12:18,490 --> 00:12:20,190
It unhooks in the front.

227
00:12:21,612 --> 00:12:23,074
That explains a lot.

228
00:12:27,850 --> 00:12:29,948
<i>Howard, I'm home!</i>

229
00:12:31,283 --> 00:12:32,283
Of course.

230
00:12:33,467 --> 00:12:35,651
<i>Senior fitness was cancelled.</i>

231
00:12:35,936 --> 00:12:38,966
<i>It turns out you can forget
how to ride a bike.</i>

232
00:12:40,199 --> 00:12:44,114
<i>I'm fine, but, oy,
did Sam Harpootian eat gravel.</i>

233
00:12:45,635 --> 00:12:46,947
That's great, Ma!

234
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:49,816
<i>What's great about
an 80-year-old Armenian man</i>

235
00:12:49,941 --> 00:12:52,041
<i>with half his chin scraped off?!</i>

236
00:12:53,434 --> 00:12:55,432
- I guess I should go.
- No, don't move.

237
00:12:55,557 --> 00:12:58,614
Hey, Ma, can I have
lamb stew for dinner?

238
00:12:58,739 --> 00:13:02,492
<i>Lamb stew?
I'd have to go to the supermarket.</i>

239
00:13:02,824 --> 00:13:05,130
Please? I got a real hankering.

240
00:13:07,974 --> 00:13:11,921
<i>Oh, I can't say no
to my little tushy face.</i>

241
00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:15,150
<i>I'll be back soon.</i>

242
00:13:18,835 --> 00:13:21,961
<i>Do you want the regular peas
or the Le Sueur?</i>

243
00:13:22,451 --> 00:13:25,261
Always Le Sueur peas with lamb stew!

244
00:13:25,386 --> 00:13:28,098
<i>You're right!
When you're right, you're right!</i>

245
00:13:30,874 --> 00:13:32,623
<i>What if they're out of the Le Sueur?</i>

246
00:13:32,748 --> 00:13:34,298
Then get the regular!

247
00:13:35,409 --> 00:13:37,804
<i>All right! You don't have to yell!</i>

248
00:13:39,736 --> 00:13:41,086
Sorry about that.

249
00:13:44,583 --> 00:13:45,866
Let me put that on vibrate.

250
00:13:46,413 --> 00:13:48,063
I'm already on vibrate.

251
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:51,163
You know, that one I got.

252
00:13:52,868 --> 00:13:55,149
Howard, did you say something
to Leonard about me?

253
00:13:55,274 --> 00:13:56,585
What do you mean?

254
00:13:56,753 --> 00:13:58,717
He says if I go see
his experiment tomorrow

255
00:13:58,842 --> 00:14:00,419
it might weird you out.

256
00:14:01,103 --> 00:14:02,254
Really? He said that?

257
00:14:02,724 --> 00:14:04,259
You're jealous of Leonard?

258
00:14:04,858 --> 00:14:06,153
Me? No.

259
00:14:06,757 --> 00:14:09,875
I may have mentioned
that it's a little inappropriate

260
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,434
to be asking another man's girlfriend
to his experiment

261
00:14:12,559 --> 00:14:15,055
without first discussing it
with said man.

262
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:17,731
Do I need to ask your permission
to hang out with Leonard?

263
00:14:18,301 --> 00:14:20,302
I didn't say anything like that.

264
00:14:21,152 --> 00:14:23,497
I said Leonard has
to ask my permission.

265
00:14:25,849 --> 00:14:29,099
Come on, I don't want to eat
lamb stew with my mother.

266
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:32,855
Damn, I was this close on the bra.

267
00:14:35,959 --> 00:14:39,503
Now, remember, Newton realized
that Aristotle was wrong

268
00:14:39,671 --> 00:14:42,135
and force was not necessary
to maintain motion.

269
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:45,509
So let's plug in our 9.8 meters
per second squared

270
00:14:46,003 --> 00:14:46,785
as "A"

271
00:14:46,910 --> 00:14:48,819
and we get force-- earth gravity--

272
00:14:48,944 --> 00:14:52,744
equals mass times 9.8 meters
per second per second.

273
00:14:52,869 --> 00:14:55,180
So we can see that "ma" equals "mg"

274
00:14:55,305 --> 00:14:57,020
and what do we know from this?

275
00:15:02,293 --> 00:15:03,694
We know that...

276
00:15:04,821 --> 00:15:07,121
Newton was a really smart cookie.

277
00:15:08,095 --> 00:15:10,826
Is that where Fig Newtons come from?

278
00:15:11,776 --> 00:15:14,830
No, Fig Newtons are named
after a small town in Massachusetts.

279
00:15:15,709 --> 00:15:17,165
Don't write that down!

280
00:15:18,668 --> 00:15:22,087
Now, if "ma" equals "mg,"
what does that imply?

281
00:15:22,573 --> 00:15:24,757
- I don't know.
- How can you not know?

282
00:15:24,882 --> 00:15:26,243
I just told you.

283
00:15:26,368 --> 00:15:28,885
Have you suffered
a recent blow to the head?

284
00:15:30,311 --> 00:15:31,847
You don't have to be so mean!

285
00:15:32,015 --> 00:15:32,930
I'm sorry.

286
00:15:33,055 --> 00:15:35,805
Have you suffered
a recent blow to the head?

287
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,897
- No, you just suck at teaching.
- Really?

288
00:15:41,261 --> 00:15:43,609
Of those two explanations,
which one seems the most likely?

289
00:15:43,777 --> 00:15:44,791
Oh, God...

290
00:15:45,933 --> 00:15:47,487
Sheldon, I'm trying to understand,

291
00:15:47,656 --> 00:15:49,009
but you're going too fast.

292
00:15:49,134 --> 00:15:51,033
Can you just back up a little bit?

293
00:15:51,651 --> 00:15:52,651
All right.

294
00:15:53,897 --> 00:15:56,797
It's a warm summer evening
in ancient Greece...

295
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:58,498
Not that far back!

296
00:16:00,199 --> 00:16:02,252
At what point
did you begin to feel lost?

297
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:05,380
I don't know.
Where were we looking up at the sky?

298
00:16:05,549 --> 00:16:07,345
- Greece.
- Damn it!

299
00:16:08,189 --> 00:16:11,637
There's no need to get frustrated.
People learn at different rates.

300
00:16:12,098 --> 00:16:16,475
Unlike objects
falling in a vacuum, which...?

301
00:16:18,984 --> 00:16:21,480
"ma" equals "mg"...?

302
00:16:22,211 --> 00:16:23,706
- Squared?
- No.

303
00:16:24,911 --> 00:16:26,446
- Aristotle?
- No.

304
00:16:27,677 --> 00:16:28,677
Five?

305
00:16:30,277 --> 00:16:32,344
Then I don't know.

306
00:16:34,207 --> 00:16:37,134
- Why are you crying?
- Because I'm stupid!

307
00:16:37,895 --> 00:16:39,595
That's no reason to cry.

308
00:16:41,259 --> 00:16:43,317
One cries because one is sad.

309
00:16:43,442 --> 00:16:45,690
For example, I cry
because others are stupid

310
00:16:45,815 --> 00:16:47,315
and it makes me sad.

311
00:16:49,685 --> 00:16:52,594
Okay, look, can we just please
forget about all this extra stuff

312
00:16:52,719 --> 00:16:55,222
and can you just tell me
what Leonard does?

313
00:16:55,390 --> 00:16:56,487
All right.

314
00:16:56,861 --> 00:16:59,100
Leonard is attempting to learn

315
00:16:59,225 --> 00:17:01,937
why sub-atomic particles
move the way they do.

316
00:17:03,037 --> 00:17:04,534
Really? That's it?

317
00:17:04,659 --> 00:17:06,525
That doesn't sound so complicated.

318
00:17:06,693 --> 00:17:07,595
It's not.

319
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:09,570
That's why Leonard does it.

320
00:17:12,958 --> 00:17:14,767
Okay, I just have one question.

321
00:17:14,892 --> 00:17:17,327
What exactly are
sub-atomic particles?

322
00:17:17,796 --> 00:17:19,246
A good question.

323
00:17:19,414 --> 00:17:20,372
Thank you.

324
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:23,657
And to answer it, we first must
ask ourselves: "What is physics?"

325
00:17:23,835 --> 00:17:24,751
Oh, balls.

326
00:17:25,752 --> 00:17:28,296
It's a warm summer evening
in ancient Greece...

327
00:17:30,368 --> 00:17:32,300
Okay, I got a bone to pick with you.

328
00:17:32,710 --> 00:17:33,760
What did I do now?

329
00:17:33,986 --> 00:17:37,236
I was in bed with Bernadette,
and you text-blocked me.

330
00:17:38,604 --> 00:17:39,516
What?!

331
00:17:39,684 --> 00:17:42,723
We were completely naked,
about to devour each other when...

332
00:17:44,212 --> 00:17:46,857
you text her that I have a problem
with her hanging out with you.

333
00:17:47,030 --> 00:17:50,130
You do have a problem
with her hanging out with me.

334
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:52,112
Yeah, but that's not
what you tell her.

335
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:53,697
What was I supposed to tell her?

336
00:17:53,865 --> 00:17:55,993
I don't know; something
that doesn't make me come off

337
00:17:56,118 --> 00:17:58,060
as a petty, jealous douche.

338
00:17:59,376 --> 00:18:01,220
And what would that be?

339
00:18:03,541 --> 00:18:06,191
Come on, do I have
to think of everything?

340
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,379
Hey, Leonard.
Am I too late to see the experiment?

341
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:15,095
- What are you doing here?
- Same thing you're doing here.

342
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:17,345
I came to see Leonard's experiment.

343
00:18:17,605 --> 00:18:20,390
No, you didn't. You said
Leonard's experiment was stupid.

344
00:18:24,657 --> 00:18:26,855
You told her
my experiment was stupid?

345
00:18:27,465 --> 00:18:29,191
I was just repeating
what Sheldon said.

346
00:18:30,586 --> 00:18:31,957
Let's not get off topic.

347
00:18:32,082 --> 00:18:34,829
Bernadette, I need to apologize.

348
00:18:34,954 --> 00:18:38,200
I was wrong to tell you
who you should be friends with.

349
00:18:38,635 --> 00:18:40,535
Should I leave you two alone?

350
00:18:40,704 --> 00:18:42,037
No, you should hear this.

351
00:18:42,205 --> 00:18:44,623
Okay, good,
'cause I wasn't really gonna go.

352
00:18:45,873 --> 00:18:48,204
Look, I know I come off

353
00:18:48,329 --> 00:18:51,052
as confident and worldly, but...

354
00:18:52,923 --> 00:18:54,549
the truth is I'm not.

355
00:18:54,794 --> 00:18:55,994
We're shocked.

356
00:18:58,290 --> 00:19:01,765
Which is why I tend to feel
threatened by other guys.

357
00:19:02,178 --> 00:19:04,716
Or loud noises, clowns and nuns.

358
00:19:07,775 --> 00:19:10,273
But I now realize
how foolish that is.

359
00:19:10,521 --> 00:19:13,902
He had a panic attack once
when he got his head stuck in a sweater.

360
00:19:15,196 --> 00:19:17,303
It was a full turtleneck.

361
00:19:18,050 --> 00:19:19,324
Why aren't you helping me?

362
00:19:19,663 --> 00:19:20,628
I don't know.

363
00:19:20,753 --> 00:19:23,394
Maybe because I'm... crazy?!

364
00:19:27,994 --> 00:19:31,211
Bernadette, please, I'm asking you
to give me another chance.

365
00:19:31,736 --> 00:19:34,738
What do you think, Leonard?
Should I give him another chance?

366
00:19:35,133 --> 00:19:37,926
It's up to you. He didn't call
your experiment stupid.

367
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:41,304
Come here, tushy face.

368
00:19:43,533 --> 00:19:46,429
"Tushy face. "
That is going on Twitter right now.

369
00:19:53,677 --> 00:19:56,153
Raj, you should've seen
Leonard's experiment.

370
00:19:56,321 --> 00:19:59,364
The interference pattern was so cool
when the electron beam was on.

371
00:19:59,859 --> 00:20:02,784
Glad you enjoyed it. Most people
aren't that interested in what I do.

372
00:20:10,137 --> 00:20:12,169
Actually, that's not true, Leonard.

373
00:20:12,383 --> 00:20:15,464
Recently I've been thinking that
given the parameters of your experiment,

374
00:20:15,632 --> 00:20:18,784
the transport of electrons
through the nano-fabricated metal rings

375
00:20:18,909 --> 00:20:20,942
is qualitatively no different
than the experiment

376
00:20:21,067 --> 00:20:23,002
already conducted
in the Netherlands.

377
00:20:26,548 --> 00:20:29,541
Their observed phase shift in the
diffusing electrons inside the ring

378
00:20:29,666 --> 00:20:31,788
already conclusively demonstrated
the electric analogue

379
00:20:31,913 --> 00:20:34,858
of the Aharonov-Bohm
quantum-interference effect.

380
00:20:40,587 --> 00:20:42,258
That's it. That's all I know.

381
00:20:43,894 --> 00:20:44,951
Oh, wait...!

382
00:20:46,016 --> 00:20:48,108
Fig Newtons were named
after a town in Massachusetts,

383
00:20:48,233 --> 00:20:49,706
not the scientist.
