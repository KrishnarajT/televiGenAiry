1
00:00:02,856 --> 00:00:06,324
Oh, hey, we ran into your
mom at Benihana last night.

2
00:00:06,326 --> 00:00:08,025
Uh, yeah, she loves that place.

3
00:00:08,027 --> 00:00:09,927
Every time they flip
a shrimp in the air,

4
00:00:09,929 --> 00:00:12,563
she practically leaps out
of her seat to catch it.

5
00:00:13,533 --> 00:00:15,833
That's why I don't take her
to SeaWorld.

6
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:18,369
I know you-you don't
want to hear it,

7
00:00:18,371 --> 00:00:19,670
but she was there with Stuart.

8
00:00:19,672 --> 00:00:20,838
That's fine.

9
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:22,073
I don't care.

10
00:00:22,075 --> 00:00:24,175
It doesn't bug you when
they go out on dates?

11
00:00:24,177 --> 00:00:25,443
They're not dating.

12
00:00:25,445 --> 00:00:28,279
They're just two friends
who went out to dinner.

13
00:00:28,281 --> 00:00:30,248
And then went back
to the home they share

14
00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:31,315
where they probably fell asleep

15
00:00:31,317 --> 00:00:32,884
in the matching pajamas
she got them

16
00:00:32,886 --> 00:00:35,820
because they both
just love penguins.

17
00:00:37,056 --> 00:00:39,790
Hey, lots of people
wear matching pajamas

18
00:00:39,792 --> 00:00:40,758
who aren't dating.

19
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:43,828
Like who?
Like you and your dog.

20
00:00:45,398 --> 00:00:48,032
Don't rule out the dating.

21
00:00:48,034 --> 00:00:50,668
Fine, it bothers me.

22
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:52,537
You happy?

23
00:00:52,539 --> 00:00:54,138
You think you've got problems.

24
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:58,075
The gibbon is the only member
of the ape family not classified

25
00:00:58,077 --> 00:01:00,878
as a great ape.

26
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:02,780
How is this helpful?

27
00:01:02,782 --> 00:01:05,316
All the non-human apes
are classified

28
00:01:05,318 --> 00:01:06,951
as great apes except one.

29
00:01:06,953 --> 00:01:10,187
That means taxonomists created
the entire category

30
00:01:10,189 --> 00:01:13,190
of lesser ape just
to single out the poor gibbon

31
00:01:13,192 --> 00:01:15,893
as the weird kid
on the playground.

32
00:01:15,895 --> 00:01:20,064
Now there's a hairy little
fellow with a genuine beef.

33
00:01:20,066 --> 00:01:23,034
But the gibbon doesn't know
what it's categorized as.

34
00:01:23,036 --> 00:01:24,669
It doesn't even know
it's called a gibbon.

35
00:01:24,671 --> 00:01:26,637
True.

36
00:01:26,639 --> 00:01:29,240
Sorry, kid, you've got it
worse than a gibbon.

00:01:54,435 --> 00:01:59,935
== sync, corrected by elderman ==
@elder_man

47
00:01:59,936 --> 00:02:01,669
Hi.

48
00:02:01,671 --> 00:02:02,603
Hey.

49
00:02:02,605 --> 00:02:03,871
We brought snacks
for movie night.

50
00:02:03,873 --> 00:02:05,172
Oh, great.

51
00:02:05,174 --> 00:02:07,108
I don't suppose you also brought
napkins, clean bowls,

52
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:08,976
utensils and a roll
of toilet paper.

53
00:02:08,978 --> 00:02:09,978
Right here.

54
00:02:09,979 --> 00:02:12,012
Ah!

55
00:02:12,014 --> 00:02:13,414
You guys are the best.

56
00:02:13,416 --> 00:02:14,482
What's with the clothes?

57
00:02:14,484 --> 00:02:16,450
Well, with all the new stuff
I bought for work,

58
00:02:16,452 --> 00:02:18,119
I needed to make room
in my closet.

59
00:02:18,121 --> 00:02:19,720
I meant why are they folded?

60
00:02:19,722 --> 00:02:21,989
But whatever.

61
00:02:21,991 --> 00:02:24,525
Ooh, what's this?

62
00:02:24,527 --> 00:02:27,428
That, believe it or not,
is my prom dress.

63
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:29,730
Wow, you still have it?

64
00:02:29,732 --> 00:02:31,232
I just assumed
it was balled up

65
00:02:31,234 --> 00:02:34,835
in the corner
of a barn somewhere.

66
00:02:37,073 --> 00:02:39,406
What kind of teenager
did you think I was?

67
00:02:39,408 --> 00:02:41,509
Slutty.
Easy.

68
00:02:42,979 --> 00:02:45,713
The word is "popular."

69
00:02:46,716 --> 00:02:48,716
How was your prom?
Did you go?

70
00:02:48,718 --> 00:02:50,251
No, but I was
on clean-up crew.

71
00:02:50,253 --> 00:02:51,919
Aw, that's sad.

72
00:02:51,921 --> 00:02:53,554
No, it was okay.

73
00:02:53,556 --> 00:02:56,090
The DJ let me dance
one slow song with my mop

74
00:02:56,092 --> 00:02:58,492
before he shut down.

75
00:02:58,494 --> 00:03:00,795
Whenever I see
a bucket of dirty water,

76
00:03:00,797 --> 00:03:04,498
I still hear "Lady in Red."

77
00:03:06,135 --> 00:03:08,402
My prom was pretty
terrible, too.

78
00:03:08,404 --> 00:03:09,703
I was so excited
about my date,

79
00:03:09,705 --> 00:03:11,472
but it turned out
he only asked me

80
00:03:11,474 --> 00:03:12,540
'cause he liked my friend.

81
00:03:12,542 --> 00:03:14,608
He spent the whole night
talking about her.

82
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:17,011
Okay, we get it, you had
a friend and a date.

83
00:03:17,013 --> 00:03:18,813
Stop bragging.

84
00:03:18,815 --> 00:03:20,381
Doesn't matter.

85
00:03:20,383 --> 00:03:21,448
Prom is silly anyways.

86
00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:23,117
Easy for you to say;
you probably went

87
00:03:23,119 --> 00:03:24,552
with the captain
of the football team.

88
00:03:24,554 --> 00:03:26,687
No.

89
00:03:26,689 --> 00:03:28,355
I just made out
with him a little

90
00:03:28,357 --> 00:03:30,224
while his date was puking.

91
00:03:30,226 --> 00:03:33,561
My date would've had
to clean that up.

92
00:03:34,931 --> 00:03:36,363
Ooh, I have an idea.

93
00:03:36,365 --> 00:03:39,400
Maybe we can have,
like, a prom do-over.

94
00:03:39,402 --> 00:03:41,335
Oh, that would be so much fun.

95
00:03:41,337 --> 00:03:44,205
We could decorate the roof
and make the guys wear tuxedos.

96
00:03:44,207 --> 00:03:46,106
Ooh, and get our hair done,
and slow-dance.

97
00:03:46,108 --> 00:03:47,374
Okay, guys, trust me,

98
00:03:47,376 --> 00:03:49,176
as someone who's been to,
like, seven proms,

99
00:03:49,178 --> 00:03:51,645
it is never as good
as you want it to be.

100
00:03:51,647 --> 00:03:54,348
You went to seven proms?

101
00:03:54,350 --> 00:03:55,549
Yeah, let's see.

102
00:03:55,551 --> 00:03:58,285
Uh, four "Under the Seas,"
two "Enchanted Evenings,"

103
00:03:58,287 --> 00:03:59,520
and one "Night to Remember"

104
00:03:59,522 --> 00:04:02,756
that... I cannot remember
for the life of me.

105
00:04:05,094 --> 00:04:06,460
Hey.

106
00:04:06,462 --> 00:04:08,162
Hey.
Hey, where's Bernadette?

107
00:04:08,164 --> 00:04:10,798
She and Amy are out dress
shopping for their prom thing.

108
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,633
Oh, yeah,
I got that Evite.

109
00:04:12,635 --> 00:04:14,368
Ever since I saw Pretty in Pink,

110
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:16,403
I've wanted to go
to an American prom.

111
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:19,073
But then I saw Carrie,

112
00:04:19,075 --> 00:04:21,809
and I did not want to go
to an American prom.

113
00:04:21,811 --> 00:04:23,110
But then I saw
Never Been Kissed,

114
00:04:23,112 --> 00:04:24,678
and I'm back
on the prom bandwagon.

115
00:04:25,982 --> 00:04:28,983
This prom thing's been
a real roller coaster.

116
00:04:30,019 --> 00:04:31,585
Bernie's really excited.

117
00:04:31,587 --> 00:04:33,821
I-I could tell because
her voice got so high,

118
00:04:33,823 --> 00:04:36,457
the beagle next door
started howling.

119
00:04:38,261 --> 00:04:39,460
Did you go to your prom?

120
00:04:39,462 --> 00:04:41,362
No.

121
00:04:41,364 --> 00:04:43,931
I had a date
with a proper education.

122
00:04:45,468 --> 00:04:49,370
Instead of a tuxedo,
I dressed myself in good habits.

123
00:04:49,372 --> 00:04:50,504
Instead of spiked punch,

124
00:04:50,506 --> 00:04:53,040
I enjoyed the intoxicating
flavor of knowledge.

125
00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:55,576
Instead of
dancing in a gym,

126
00:04:55,578 --> 00:04:58,145
I shook my booty
to the seductive rhythms...

127
00:04:58,147 --> 00:04:59,813
Okay, okay.

128
00:04:59,815 --> 00:05:01,548
of AP Calculus.

129
00:05:05,254 --> 00:05:06,587
How come you're not shopping
with Amy and Bernadette?

130
00:05:06,589 --> 00:05:09,390
Let me guess, you think
the whole idea is lame?

131
00:05:09,392 --> 00:05:10,891
Well, who cares what I think?
What do you think?

132
00:05:10,893 --> 00:05:12,893
Hmm, to be honest,

133
00:05:12,895 --> 00:05:15,963
it's kind of a dream come true
to go to even a fake prom

134
00:05:15,965 --> 00:05:17,564
with a woman
as beautiful as you.

135
00:05:17,566 --> 00:05:20,234
Ugh, thanks a lot.

136
00:05:20,236 --> 00:05:22,036
What?

137
00:05:22,038 --> 00:05:26,173
Well, now I can't blow this
thing off without being a bitch.

138
00:05:26,175 --> 00:05:28,575
That sounds like a "yes"!

139
00:05:31,447 --> 00:05:34,815
Ooh, every single person
RSVP'd "yes."

140
00:05:34,817 --> 00:05:36,583
This is so exciting!

141
00:05:36,585 --> 00:05:38,919
Isn't this exciting?

142
00:05:42,024 --> 00:05:43,424
Yep.

143
00:05:43,426 --> 00:05:45,926
Look, even Stuart's
bringing a date.

144
00:05:45,928 --> 00:05:46,994
I wonder who it is.

145
00:05:46,996 --> 00:05:48,929
You know exactly
who it is.

146
00:05:48,931 --> 00:05:50,264
He's gonna bring my mom.

147
00:05:50,266 --> 00:05:51,799
Why did you even invite him?

148
00:05:51,801 --> 00:05:54,535
Because he's our friend,
and you two need to get along.

149
00:05:54,537 --> 00:05:55,970
And why can't
he take your mom?

150
00:05:55,972 --> 00:05:58,739
You took her
to your prom.

151
00:05:58,741 --> 00:06:02,643
I didn't "take" her;
she was a chaperone.

152
00:06:02,645 --> 00:06:05,779
I saw a picture of you two
dancing together.

153
00:06:05,781 --> 00:06:06,914
W-What was I gonna do?

154
00:06:06,916 --> 00:06:08,415
They were playing our song!

155
00:06:10,119 --> 00:06:12,419
I can't take
this anymore.

156
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:17,091
Hello.

157
00:06:17,093 --> 00:06:18,359
Stuart, we have to talk.

158
00:06:18,361 --> 00:06:23,063
This thing with you and my mom,
I-I hate it.

159
00:06:23,065 --> 00:06:24,798
It's making me crazy.

160
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,334
You and I were
friends for years,

161
00:06:27,336 --> 00:06:30,838
and now you're bringing my
mother to a party I'm going to?

162
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:32,306
What the hell?

163
00:06:32,308 --> 00:06:34,875
I'm not bringing your mother,
I have a date.

164
00:06:34,877 --> 00:06:37,411
Oh, so now you're cheating
on my mother?

165
00:06:40,249 --> 00:06:42,249
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

166
00:06:42,251 --> 00:06:43,717
Wha-What are you talking about?

167
00:06:43,719 --> 00:06:46,720
There's nothing weird going on
with me and your mother.

168
00:06:46,722 --> 00:06:49,590
Stewie,
your bath is getting cold!

169
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:52,960
I got to go, bye.

170
00:06:55,898 --> 00:06:57,364
Penny?

171
00:06:57,366 --> 00:06:58,599
Penny.

172
00:06:58,601 --> 00:06:59,833
Penny.

173
00:06:59,835 --> 00:07:01,201
Penny.

174
00:07:01,203 --> 00:07:02,936
Penny.

175
00:07:02,938 --> 00:07:05,272
You knocked more than usual.

176
00:07:05,274 --> 00:07:06,473
Next time I might be in a rush,

177
00:07:06,475 --> 00:07:08,042
it's good to have
a few in the bank.

178
00:07:08,044 --> 00:07:09,843
Okay, what's up?

179
00:07:09,845 --> 00:07:12,212
I'd like to discuss this party

180
00:07:12,214 --> 00:07:13,747
that Amy and Bernadette
are throwing.

181
00:07:13,749 --> 00:07:16,917
Since you and I are both
reluctant to go,

182
00:07:16,919 --> 00:07:20,487
I think I've come up with a
perfect way for us to enjoy it.

183
00:07:20,489 --> 00:07:21,889
Great, how?

184
00:07:21,891 --> 00:07:24,024
We pretend we're aliens.

185
00:07:27,263 --> 00:07:28,896
I'm not the best
at reading facial cues,

186
00:07:28,898 --> 00:07:31,765
but I'm gonna say that you love
it and want to hear more.

187
00:07:33,602 --> 00:07:35,335
Now,
in the beloved novel

188
00:07:35,337 --> 00:07:37,237
Hitchhiker's Guide
to the Galaxy,

189
00:07:37,239 --> 00:07:40,741
an alien named Ford Prefect
pretended to be human

190
00:07:40,743 --> 00:07:43,977
in order to blend in so that he
could write an entry about Earth

191
00:07:43,979 --> 00:07:46,146
for The Hitchhiker's Guide
to the Galaxy,

192
00:07:46,148 --> 00:07:48,749
which is a travel book
within the actual book,

193
00:07:48,751 --> 00:07:49,950
which is also called

194
00:07:49,952 --> 00:07:52,753
The Hitchhiker's Guide
to the Galaxy.

195
00:07:52,755 --> 00:07:55,589
Okay, just one question.

196
00:07:55,591 --> 00:07:56,857
What?

197
00:07:58,260 --> 00:08:01,061
My point is,
pretending to be an alien is

198
00:08:01,063 --> 00:08:03,430
a valuable coping mechanism
I've used many times.

199
00:08:03,432 --> 00:08:06,567
I did it the first time
I went to see you in a play.

200
00:08:08,370 --> 00:08:10,737
You had no idea
Commander Umfrumf

201
00:08:10,739 --> 00:08:12,973
of Ceti Alpha Three
was in the audience.

202
00:08:14,009 --> 00:08:16,877
Oh, d-don't worry,
he gave you seven thumbs up.

203
00:08:17,847 --> 00:08:19,680
Here's a question...

204
00:08:19,682 --> 00:08:22,883
as an alien pretending to be
human, are you planning

205
00:08:22,885 --> 00:08:27,688
to engage in any post-prom
mating rituals with Amy?

206
00:08:30,826 --> 00:08:34,561
There are post-prom
mating rituals?

207
00:08:34,563 --> 00:08:35,863
Not always.

208
00:08:35,865 --> 00:08:38,031
Unless your date drives
a van with an air mattress,

209
00:08:38,033 --> 00:08:39,900
then always.

210
00:08:41,770 --> 00:08:44,938
Well, if it's part of the prom
experience, then I'm open to it.

211
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:47,674
You're kidding.

212
00:08:47,676 --> 00:08:50,611
I may be an alien,
but I have urges.

213
00:08:52,715 --> 00:08:55,649
If Amy wants to copulate
by firing her eggs into space,

214
00:08:55,651 --> 00:08:57,384
well, then,
I will happily catch them

215
00:08:57,386 --> 00:09:00,554
with the reproductive sac
on my upper flermin.

216
00:09:04,693 --> 00:09:07,060
I'm not the best
at reading facial cues,

217
00:09:07,062 --> 00:09:09,863
but I can see that
you're a little turned on.

218
00:09:13,269 --> 00:09:15,636
You know, if you're not
gonna learn how to do this,

219
00:09:15,638 --> 00:09:17,304
they make some
pretty good clip-ons.

220
00:09:17,306 --> 00:09:20,707
Bruce Wayne doesn't
wear a clip-on.

221
00:09:20,709 --> 00:09:25,078
Bruce Wayne doesn't make
his roommate tie it for him.

222
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:27,948
His name is Alfred,
and, yes, he does.

223
00:09:30,452 --> 00:09:32,419
There, perfect.

224
00:09:32,421 --> 00:09:33,687
What, are you sure?

225
00:09:33,689 --> 00:09:36,323
It's my first prom,
I want to do it correctly.

226
00:09:36,325 --> 00:09:38,559
I thought you were gonna
pretend to be an alien.

227
00:09:38,561 --> 00:09:41,028
I was, but Penny didn't want to.

228
00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:42,529
You didn't want to.

229
00:09:42,531 --> 00:09:46,433
Bernadette, Amy, Koothrappali
and Wolowitz didn't want to.

230
00:09:46,435 --> 00:09:49,703
And even I knew it was weird
to hire somebody.

231
00:09:54,410 --> 00:09:56,343
Was that a flask?

232
00:09:56,345 --> 00:09:57,744
Yes.

233
00:09:57,746 --> 00:09:59,780
I've decided to embrace
all of the traditions

234
00:09:59,782 --> 00:10:02,683
associated with prom,
including spiking the punch.

235
00:10:04,853 --> 00:10:07,120
You're gonna put alcohol
in the punch?

236
00:10:07,122 --> 00:10:09,823
Oh, no, this is
pomegranate juice.

237
00:10:09,825 --> 00:10:12,259
It's all the fun
of high school high jinks

238
00:10:12,261 --> 00:10:15,529
with the cell-protecting zip
of antioxidants.

239
00:10:17,299 --> 00:10:19,166
If you had ripped jeans
and a leather jacket,

240
00:10:19,168 --> 00:10:22,002
you'd be like the toughest kid
on the Disney Channel.

241
00:10:23,772 --> 00:10:26,740
So, anything else
planned for tonight?

242
00:10:26,742 --> 00:10:28,408
Oh, everything.

243
00:10:28,410 --> 00:10:31,144
Getting our picture taken,
slow-dancing,

244
00:10:31,146 --> 00:10:33,480
being elected prom king.

245
00:10:35,084 --> 00:10:37,551
Pointing out that
kings aren't elected.

246
00:10:39,521 --> 00:10:42,456
It's gonna be off the hook.

247
00:10:42,458 --> 00:10:45,025
And while you're at it,

248
00:10:45,027 --> 00:10:47,394
I know that at this age
your hormones are raging,

249
00:10:47,396 --> 00:10:49,363
but just because all
your friends are having sex

250
00:10:49,365 --> 00:10:50,664
doesn't mean you have to.

251
00:10:53,002 --> 00:10:54,534
Why would you say that?

252
00:10:54,536 --> 00:10:56,837
You know, 'cause...

253
00:10:56,839 --> 00:10:59,139
'cause a lot of people lose
their virginity on prom night.

254
00:10:59,141 --> 00:11:01,141
Penny implied the same thing.

255
00:11:01,143 --> 00:11:02,276
Is this true?

256
00:11:02,278 --> 00:11:04,211
Just relax, it's a joke.

257
00:11:04,213 --> 00:11:07,047
You don't have
hormones.

258
00:11:20,535 --> 00:11:22,483
Wow, you look amazing.

259
00:11:22,619 --> 00:11:25,186
Thank you, so do you.

260
00:11:25,517 --> 00:11:27,450
Sheldon,
you look so handsome.

261
00:11:27,452 --> 00:11:29,719
Thank you.

262
00:11:30,922 --> 00:11:32,956
Sheldon, doesn't Amy look hot?

263
00:11:32,958 --> 00:11:36,159
That's got to put some starch
in the upper flermin.

264
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:39,195
What's that?

265
00:11:39,197 --> 00:11:41,030
Oh, it's a scaly
genital organ

266
00:11:41,032 --> 00:11:42,732
that grows between
his shoulder blades.

267
00:11:42,734 --> 00:11:45,802
Try not to touch it
when you're dancing.

268
00:11:46,771 --> 00:11:48,004
Excuse me.

269
00:11:48,006 --> 00:11:49,305
Where are you going?

270
00:11:49,307 --> 00:11:50,573
I can't do this.

271
00:11:50,575 --> 00:11:52,075
And for your information,
Leonard,

272
00:11:52,077 --> 00:11:53,943
the upper flermin doesn't grow
between my shoulder blades,

273
00:11:53,945 --> 00:11:56,246
it grows out of the belly button
on my neck.

274
00:12:00,018 --> 00:12:03,153
He's right, I was thinking
of the lower flermin.

275
00:12:05,323 --> 00:12:09,058
Ooh, I'll, uh, text Stuart,
let him know we're close.

276
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:10,660
That's a neat tattoo.

277
00:12:10,662 --> 00:12:14,063
Oh, thanks, it's Sally from
Nightmare before Christmas.

278
00:12:14,065 --> 00:12:15,298
Aw, that movie's
so cute.

279
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:17,400
Do you like her because
you both have red hair?

280
00:12:17,402 --> 00:12:20,170
Uh, a little, but more
that she's covered in scars

281
00:12:20,172 --> 00:12:23,139
and can pull her own limbs off
and sew them back on.

282
00:12:24,943 --> 00:12:27,944
I like Cinderella.

283
00:12:29,381 --> 00:12:30,914
Did you know,
in the original book,

284
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:32,949
the sisters cut off
their toes with knives

285
00:12:32,951 --> 00:12:34,851
in order to fit
in the glass slipper?

286
00:12:36,121 --> 00:12:38,988
I like "Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo."

287
00:12:40,358 --> 00:12:42,425
Hey, here comes
Stuart and his date.

288
00:12:42,427 --> 00:12:43,560
Oh, she's cute.

289
00:12:44,663 --> 00:12:46,396
Oh, my God.

290
00:12:46,398 --> 00:12:47,497
What?

291
00:12:47,499 --> 00:12:48,431
That's Jeanie.

292
00:12:48,433 --> 00:12:49,399
That's Jeanie?

293
00:12:49,401 --> 00:12:51,167
Who's Jeanie?
Don't say it.

294
00:12:51,169 --> 00:12:53,336
That's Howard's cousin
that he had sex with.

295
00:12:56,675 --> 00:12:58,641
She is my second cousin.

296
00:12:58,643 --> 00:13:01,311
We were 15... I just said,
"Don't say it."

297
00:13:01,313 --> 00:13:02,979
No, it's okay.

298
00:13:02,981 --> 00:13:04,847
He told me that story
a long time ago.

299
00:13:04,849 --> 00:13:05,915
Raj!

300
00:13:05,917 --> 00:13:07,050
It was our first date,

301
00:13:07,052 --> 00:13:08,151
there was an
awkward silence.

302
00:13:08,153 --> 00:13:10,753
What was I
supposed to say?

303
00:13:16,561 --> 00:13:18,728
Oh, it's beautiful.

304
00:13:18,730 --> 00:13:20,997
Oh, the girls really
did a nice job.

305
00:13:20,999 --> 00:13:22,098
Aw...

306
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:23,566
I know I wasn't
into this before,

307
00:13:23,568 --> 00:13:26,102
but I'm so glad I get
to take you to your first prom.

308
00:13:26,104 --> 00:13:28,104
What makes you think
I didn't go to my prom?

309
00:13:28,106 --> 00:13:30,106
I went.
Well, who'd you go with?

310
00:13:30,108 --> 00:13:34,077
I took a little lady
I like to call loneliness.

311
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:35,245
Aw...

312
00:13:35,247 --> 00:13:36,613
Aw, it's all right.

313
00:13:36,615 --> 00:13:37,914
We ended up having a threesome

314
00:13:37,916 --> 00:13:39,882
with her friend humiliation,
so...

315
00:13:42,187 --> 00:13:44,487
Well, if I would have been
there and saw you alone,

316
00:13:44,489 --> 00:13:45,755
I would've asked you
to dance.

317
00:13:45,757 --> 00:13:46,856
No, you wouldn't have.

318
00:13:46,858 --> 00:13:47,957
Well, you don't
know that.

319
00:13:47,959 --> 00:13:49,425
It was before
my growth spurt.

320
00:13:49,427 --> 00:13:50,560
What, that already happened?

321
00:13:52,564 --> 00:13:54,530
Very funny.

322
00:13:54,532 --> 00:13:56,099
Well, you wouldn't
have asked me either.

323
00:13:56,101 --> 00:13:57,333
I would have asked you.

324
00:13:58,203 --> 00:13:59,369
In my head.

325
00:14:01,139 --> 00:14:03,539
On the way home.

326
00:14:03,541 --> 00:14:05,808
While I was having a good cry.

327
00:14:12,350 --> 00:14:13,616
Sheldon, can I come in?

328
00:14:13,618 --> 00:14:15,952
I don't think
that's a good idea.

329
00:14:15,954 --> 00:14:17,186
Why not?

330
00:14:17,188 --> 00:14:19,322
According to an online
message board,

331
00:14:19,324 --> 00:14:21,491
I may be having a panic attack.

332
00:14:21,493 --> 00:14:23,726
SoccerMom09 had
similar symptoms.

333
00:14:25,563 --> 00:14:29,866
But to be fair, the twins were
a real handful that day.

334
00:14:29,868 --> 00:14:31,267
You're making me worry.

335
00:14:31,269 --> 00:14:32,402
What's going on?

336
00:14:32,404 --> 00:14:36,306
What's going on is we're
about to go to a prom.

337
00:14:36,308 --> 00:14:37,440
And there's
a great deal of pressure

338
00:14:37,442 --> 00:14:39,409
on young couples
like us to engage in

339
00:14:39,411 --> 00:14:43,746
what Mr. Bob Eubanks
called making whoopee.

340
00:14:43,748 --> 00:14:45,381
What pressure?

341
00:14:45,383 --> 00:14:47,183
All I said was
you look handsome.

342
00:14:47,185 --> 00:14:49,919
Can you please
open the door?

343
00:14:49,921 --> 00:14:51,754
It's not just that.

344
00:14:51,756 --> 00:14:54,324
Leonard and Penny also
made comments about it.

345
00:14:54,326 --> 00:14:55,958
And I'm not blind.

346
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:58,494
Even I looked twice
when I saw my posterior

347
00:14:58,496 --> 00:15:00,530
in these tuxedo pants.

348
00:15:02,701 --> 00:15:05,301
So, I met Jeanie
at your Aunt Gladys'.

349
00:15:05,303 --> 00:15:06,803
She passed me
the Manischewitz,

350
00:15:06,805 --> 00:15:08,504
I took one look
at this punim,

351
00:15:08,506 --> 00:15:11,674
and I almost plotzed
on the kugel.

352
00:15:13,478 --> 00:15:16,045
Is this what I sound like
when I talk about India?

353
00:15:18,917 --> 00:15:20,950
So, my mother's okay
with this?

354
00:15:20,952 --> 00:15:23,419
Why would your mother have
a problem with me and Stuart?

355
00:15:23,421 --> 00:15:26,522
'Cause they have a weird,
inappropriate relationship.

356
00:15:26,524 --> 00:15:29,959
Weirder than what you and I
did in my dad's Corolla?

357
00:15:32,931 --> 00:15:34,430
This is so messed up.

358
00:15:34,432 --> 00:15:37,533
I know, I'm having
the best time.

359
00:15:37,535 --> 00:15:40,370
Why would you even come to this?

360
00:15:40,372 --> 00:15:41,871
Didn't you know I'd be here?

361
00:15:41,873 --> 00:15:43,840
It was a long
time ago, Howard.

362
00:15:43,842 --> 00:15:46,008
And you're only second
cousins, who cares?

363
00:15:46,010 --> 00:15:48,478
So, you knew and you
brought her anyway?

364
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:51,481
Oh, so she's good enough
for Howard, but not for me?

365
00:15:51,483 --> 00:15:52,448
Yeah.

366
00:15:52,450 --> 00:15:53,449
Yeah, go have weird
relationships

367
00:15:53,451 --> 00:15:54,550
with your own
mother and cousin.

368
00:15:54,552 --> 00:15:55,552
This is his turf.

369
00:15:55,553 --> 00:15:56,753
Yeah.

370
00:16:00,225 --> 00:16:03,359
Well, I might not have
asked you to dance then,

371
00:16:03,361 --> 00:16:05,828
but I will ask you now.
There's no music.

372
00:16:05,830 --> 00:16:07,063
I don't care.

373
00:16:07,065 --> 00:16:08,264
We'll make
our own music.

374
00:16:08,266 --> 00:16:10,266
My God, who's the dork now?

375
00:16:18,209 --> 00:16:20,643
Thank you for
wearing your flats.

376
00:16:20,645 --> 00:16:22,845
Thank you for
wearing your heels.

377
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:26,783
Mmm.

378
00:16:26,785 --> 00:16:28,117
Look at me.

379
00:16:28,119 --> 00:16:31,354
Dancing with the prettiest
girl at the prom.

380
00:16:31,356 --> 00:16:33,423
Want to take a picture
of us and send it

381
00:16:33,425 --> 00:16:36,159
to your old friends
in the chess club?

382
00:16:36,161 --> 00:16:39,061
I sent them a bikini shot
of you years ago.

383
00:16:42,233 --> 00:16:44,667
This is nice.

384
00:16:44,669 --> 00:16:46,636
I kind of wish
no one else was coming.

385
00:16:46,638 --> 00:16:49,705
I know, me, too.

386
00:16:49,707 --> 00:16:53,543
But it will be fun to have a
prom without all the drama.

387
00:16:56,548 --> 00:16:58,014
Howie, get off of him!

388
00:16:58,016 --> 00:17:01,451
Not until he stops humping
his way up my family tree!

389
00:17:03,455 --> 00:17:06,055
Sheldon, this is silly.

390
00:17:06,057 --> 00:17:07,523
I'm not missing another prom.

391
00:17:07,525 --> 00:17:08,624
I'm going upstairs now.

392
00:17:08,626 --> 00:17:10,159
Good-bye.

393
00:17:10,161 --> 00:17:13,262
I really did think
you looked pretty.

394
00:17:13,264 --> 00:17:15,097
You did?

395
00:17:15,099 --> 00:17:17,433
Yes.

396
00:17:17,435 --> 00:17:19,836
So much so that
I started to panic.

397
00:17:19,838 --> 00:17:21,771
Well, you can relax.

398
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:25,274
Just because you think
I look pretty

399
00:17:25,276 --> 00:17:27,710
doesn't mean we have
to spend the night together.

400
00:17:27,712 --> 00:17:31,347
Were you hoping we would
because it's prom?

401
00:17:31,349 --> 00:17:33,683
I'm always hoping.

402
00:17:34,919 --> 00:17:39,255
But tonight I just wanted
to have a nice time with you.

403
00:17:39,257 --> 00:17:42,425
And maybe dance
with someone who has arms.

404
00:17:44,395 --> 00:17:46,162
Thank you for understanding.

405
00:17:46,164 --> 00:17:48,498
Of course I understand.

406
00:17:50,468 --> 00:17:53,035
Sheldon,

407
00:17:53,037 --> 00:17:55,037
there's something else
I've been wanting to say,

408
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:57,006
but before I do,
I just...

409
00:17:57,008 --> 00:18:00,743
I want you to know that you
don't have to say it back.

410
00:18:00,745 --> 00:18:02,712
I know you're not ready,

411
00:18:02,714 --> 00:18:04,247
and I don't want you to say it

412
00:18:04,249 --> 00:18:05,848
just because
social convention dictates...

413
00:18:05,850 --> 00:18:07,817
I love you, too.

414
00:18:11,322 --> 00:18:13,322
You said it.

415
00:18:13,324 --> 00:18:15,992
There's no denying
I have feelings for you

416
00:18:15,994 --> 00:18:18,361
that can't be explained
in any other way.

417
00:18:19,397 --> 00:18:23,399
I briefly considered
that I had a brain parasite.

418
00:18:25,870 --> 00:18:28,538
But that seems even
more farfetched.

419
00:18:31,509 --> 00:18:33,543
The only conclusion was love.

420
00:18:37,549 --> 00:18:39,181
I know what's happening.

421
00:18:40,518 --> 00:18:42,952
This is a panic attack.

422
00:18:42,954 --> 00:18:45,555
SoccerMom09 says to lie down
with your feet elevated.

423
00:18:45,557 --> 00:18:46,722
Okay.

424
00:18:46,724 --> 00:18:48,558
Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa.

425
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:50,159
Just because I love you
doesn't mean

426
00:18:50,161 --> 00:18:52,094
girls are allowed in my room.

427
00:19:07,823 --> 00:19:09,723
Okay.

428
00:19:09,725 --> 00:19:11,425
Here we go...

429
00:19:11,427 --> 00:19:13,994
Say "Cheese"!

430
00:19:16,398 --> 00:19:18,899
Say "Cheese"!

431
00:19:21,403 --> 00:19:24,037
Say "Cousin"!

432
00:19:26,675 --> 00:19:28,375
Say...

433
00:19:29,378 --> 00:19:30,378
Oh, sorry.

434
00:19:30,379 --> 00:19:32,579
Hang on, sorry.

435
00:19:34,548 --> 00:19:36,316
Hey, Debbie.

436
00:19:36,318 --> 00:19:38,351
I... Yeah, yeah, I'm
here with Jeanie.

437
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:41,222
Okay, but we're just friends.

438
00:19:41,431 --> 00:19:44,790
It's... Yeah. I got to go.

439
00:19:44,791 --> 00:19:51,291
