1
00:00:02,447 --> 00:00:04,648
Leonard, what time does
your mom's plane get in?

2
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:06,216
I don't know...
some time tomorrow morning.

3
00:00:06,218 --> 00:00:08,118
Don't you want
to know for sure?

4
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:10,621
No need to. As soon as she flies
into California airspace,

5
00:00:10,623 --> 00:00:12,689
I'll feel a disturbance
in the Force.

6
00:00:14,325 --> 00:00:16,360
It's so nice
both of your moms are coming in

7
00:00:16,362 --> 00:00:17,861
to see you guys get an award.

8
00:00:17,863 --> 00:00:21,265
Well, my mother's been there
for every honor I've won

9
00:00:21,267 --> 00:00:22,799
since I beat out my twin sister

10
00:00:22,801 --> 00:00:24,735
for the "did it
on the potty" trophy.

11
00:00:26,271 --> 00:00:27,704
How does this look?

12
00:00:27,706 --> 00:00:30,173
Aw, it's so nice.
She's gonna love it.

13
00:00:30,175 --> 00:00:31,441
Sure, his mom gets roses.

14
00:00:31,443 --> 00:00:32,643
When I want them,

15
00:00:32,645 --> 00:00:35,579
they're a "bouquet of
severed plant genitals."

16
00:00:36,614 --> 00:00:38,015
You act like I didn't get you

17
00:00:38,017 --> 00:00:40,350
that mushroom log
on Valentine's Day.

18
00:00:40,352 --> 00:00:41,718
He's right.

19
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:45,389
Roses die, but a moist rotting
log will pump out mushrooms

20
00:00:45,391 --> 00:00:47,891
for two or three magical years.

21
00:00:47,893 --> 00:00:49,893
You know,
your mom's never been

22
00:00:49,895 --> 00:00:51,161
too thrilled
with our relationship.

23
00:00:51,163 --> 00:00:52,963
Maybe I should get her something
so she warms up to me.

24
00:00:52,965 --> 00:00:54,665
If you could run
out and get a PhD,

25
00:00:54,667 --> 00:00:57,234
that might make
her like you.

26
00:00:57,236 --> 00:01:00,537
Really?
It didn't work for you.

27
00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:02,039
Do you think
the moms will get along?

28
00:01:02,041 --> 00:01:03,740
Uh, I don't know.
They're pretty different.

29
00:01:03,742 --> 00:01:05,609
Maybe they'll be best friends.

30
00:01:05,611 --> 00:01:08,645
One of them is brilliant,
one is sweet and simple.

31
00:01:08,647 --> 00:01:11,415

@elder_man

42
00:01:40,705 --> 00:01:44,107
Shelly, I'm so proud of you and
Leonard for getting this award.

43
00:01:44,109 --> 00:01:45,976
Oh, thank you, Mother.

44
00:01:45,978 --> 00:01:48,011
I tried to read your paper,
but it was very hard

45
00:01:48,013 --> 00:01:49,246
for me to understand.

46
00:01:49,248 --> 00:01:51,248
Oh, it's quite
straightforward, actually.

47
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:53,884
It describes a new model
of the universe

48
00:01:53,886 --> 00:01:56,219
that conceptualizes it
as the surface

49
00:01:56,221 --> 00:01:57,921
of an n-dimensional
superfluid.

50
00:01:57,923 --> 00:01:58,889
Interesting.

51
00:01:58,891 --> 00:02:00,290
You can believe that,

52
00:02:00,292 --> 00:02:04,561
but God filling an ark with
animals two-by-two is nonsense.

53
00:02:06,397 --> 00:02:10,067
What did they feed
the lions, Mother?

54
00:02:10,069 --> 00:02:15,105
The floating bodies of
drowned sinners, of course.

55
00:02:18,042 --> 00:02:21,845
Listen, Leonard's mom is
a renowned psychiatrist

56
00:02:21,847 --> 00:02:23,447
and woman of science.

57
00:02:23,449 --> 00:02:26,149
Can you please keep
the Bible babble to yourself

58
00:02:26,151 --> 00:02:27,617
while she's here?

59
00:02:27,619 --> 00:02:29,252
Are you ashamed of me?

60
00:02:29,254 --> 00:02:32,656
Of course not.
I love you.

61
00:02:32,658 --> 00:02:36,960
I'm just embarrassed by the
things you believe, do and say.

62
00:02:39,764 --> 00:02:42,466
Well, I love you, too.

63
00:02:43,568 --> 00:02:45,769
My little bowl
of lion chow.

64
00:02:48,406 --> 00:02:51,341
So, have you and Penny
set a wedding date?

65
00:02:51,343 --> 00:02:53,777
No, we're kind of
taking it slow.

66
00:02:53,779 --> 00:02:55,612
I see.

67
00:02:58,683 --> 00:03:00,016
What does that mean?

68
00:03:00,018 --> 00:03:03,086
You've been on and off with
this woman for seven years

69
00:03:03,088 --> 00:03:04,621
and engaged for one year.

70
00:03:04,623 --> 00:03:07,290
One has to wonder
if there's a problem.

71
00:03:07,292 --> 00:03:10,627
Are you having
satisfactory intercourse?

72
00:03:11,462 --> 00:03:13,797
Yes, Mother.

73
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:19,369
Only satisfactory.
I see.

74
00:03:21,205 --> 00:03:23,173
I change my answer.

75
00:03:23,175 --> 00:03:24,808
It-it's amazing.
It's hot.

76
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:28,545
We can barely keep our
hands off each other.

77
00:03:28,547 --> 00:03:30,814
Seems odd to try
and impress your mother

78
00:03:30,816 --> 00:03:34,184
with your
sexual prowess.

79
00:03:34,186 --> 00:03:38,555
But then, you always did have
that unresolved Oedipal complex.

80
00:03:38,557 --> 00:03:40,557
See, this right here,
what you're doing,

81
00:03:40,559 --> 00:03:43,193
can you please not do that
around Sheldon's mom?

82
00:03:43,195 --> 00:03:46,730
Why? Are you attracted
to her, too?

83
00:03:46,732 --> 00:03:48,131
Of course not.

84
00:03:48,133 --> 00:03:51,001
She's-she's just a very
sweet and God-fearing lady,

85
00:03:51,003 --> 00:03:53,436
and you have to be
respectful of her beliefs.

86
00:03:53,438 --> 00:03:54,738
Leonard, I'm an adult.

87
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:57,073
I know how to conduct myself
around people

88
00:03:57,075 --> 00:03:58,909
from different
walks of life.

89
00:03:58,911 --> 00:03:59,943
Thank you.

90
00:03:59,945 --> 00:04:00,844
Where is she from again?

91
00:04:00,846 --> 00:04:03,513
East Texas.
Ugh.

92
00:04:07,051 --> 00:04:08,618
Hey, look who's here.

93
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:12,656
Oh, Dr. Hofstadter,
it's so good to see you again.

94
00:04:12,658 --> 00:04:13,790
Likewise.

95
00:04:13,792 --> 00:04:16,259
I read your paper;
it was very impressive.

96
00:04:16,261 --> 00:04:17,360
Oh, thank you.

97
00:04:17,362 --> 00:04:19,362
We just spent
two hours in traffic.

98
00:04:19,364 --> 00:04:22,532
Did you think to mention to me
that you liked our paper?

99
00:04:22,534 --> 00:04:24,901
Of course I did, but
it's a mother's job

100
00:04:24,903 --> 00:04:27,571
to make sure her child's
self-esteem is not dependent

101
00:04:27,573 --> 00:04:28,872
on anyone's approval.

102
00:04:30,708 --> 00:04:33,410
That's so sweet,
you think I have self-esteem.

103
00:04:33,412 --> 00:04:37,214
Dr. Hofstadter, I want you
to meet my mother, Mary.

104
00:04:37,216 --> 00:04:38,548
So nice to meet you.

105
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:40,750
Nice to meet you, too.
How was your flight?

106
00:04:40,752 --> 00:04:42,185
Very pleasant. And yours?

107
00:04:42,187 --> 00:04:44,120
Lovely. Almost
as if someone...

108
00:04:44,122 --> 00:04:46,957
not saying who... was
watching over the plane.

109
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:51,328
You're kidding, right?

110
00:04:52,496 --> 00:04:55,799
Subtle, mom,
real subtle.

111
00:05:01,839 --> 00:05:02,672
Stuart.

112
00:05:02,674 --> 00:05:06,076
Morning.

113
00:05:06,078 --> 00:05:07,877
We talked about this.

114
00:05:07,879 --> 00:05:09,212
I don't mind you
still living here,

115
00:05:09,214 --> 00:05:10,647
but we got to have
some rules.

116
00:05:10,649 --> 00:05:12,916
And rule number one is pants.

117
00:05:15,152 --> 00:05:17,721
Hey, hey.

118
00:05:21,292 --> 00:05:23,059
You must be very
proud of your son.

119
00:05:23,061 --> 00:05:24,294
Oh, yes.

120
00:05:24,296 --> 00:05:28,198
He recently argued a case
before the Supreme Court.

121
00:05:30,067 --> 00:05:32,102
He did?

122
00:05:32,937 --> 00:05:35,872
Oh, you mean this son.

123
00:05:35,874 --> 00:05:39,376
Uh, sure,
he's terrific.

124
00:05:39,378 --> 00:05:42,779
Uh, Beverly, would you like
to see the math I worked out

125
00:05:42,781 --> 00:05:44,347
to support our hypothesis?

126
00:05:44,349 --> 00:05:45,715
Uh, you mean,
my hypothesis.

127
00:05:45,717 --> 00:05:47,417
I hypothesized it
all by myself.

128
00:05:47,419 --> 00:05:49,719
Calm down, dear.

129
00:05:49,721 --> 00:05:51,021
Mary, I'm curious.

130
00:05:51,023 --> 00:05:52,188
When did you
first realize

131
00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:54,624
that your son had such
a remarkable mind?

132
00:05:54,626 --> 00:05:56,559
Ooh, good question.

133
00:05:56,561 --> 00:05:59,562
Everyone loves stories about
Sheldon Cooper, boy genius.

134
00:06:00,998 --> 00:06:03,133
Well, I would have to say
when he was 13

135
00:06:03,135 --> 00:06:06,102
and tried to build a nuclear
reactor in the tool shed.

136
00:06:06,104 --> 00:06:08,104
Ooh, this is a good one.

137
00:06:09,473 --> 00:06:11,641
Now, the first thing you have
to know about Shelly is

138
00:06:11,643 --> 00:06:12,942
ever since he was a little boy,

139
00:06:12,944 --> 00:06:16,780
he was always concerned
with the well-being of others.

140
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:21,351
And he didn't think
that it was fair

141
00:06:21,353 --> 00:06:23,320
for people to pay
for electricity,

142
00:06:23,322 --> 00:06:26,456
so he was gonna power
the entire town for free.

143
00:06:26,458 --> 00:06:27,791
Tell her about the uranium!

144
00:06:27,793 --> 00:06:29,225
Tell her about
the uranium.

145
00:06:29,227 --> 00:06:30,894
Oh, well!

146
00:06:30,896 --> 00:06:32,195
Oh, this is adorable.

147
00:06:32,197 --> 00:06:35,532
When he arranged to get
some yellowcake from Chad,

148
00:06:35,534 --> 00:06:37,934
I thought he was talking
about Twinkies

149
00:06:37,936 --> 00:06:39,669
from one of his friends.

150
00:06:39,671 --> 00:06:40,671
Yeah.

151
00:06:40,672 --> 00:06:41,905
But I wasn't.

152
00:06:41,907 --> 00:06:44,741
'Cause I didn't
have any friends.

153
00:06:44,743 --> 00:06:46,643
No.

154
00:06:47,712 --> 00:06:49,713
It turns out that this
little scallywag was trying

155
00:06:49,715 --> 00:06:52,449
to use my Visa card
to buy uranium

156
00:06:52,451 --> 00:06:56,619
from an African warlord
in the country of Chad!

157
00:06:58,689 --> 00:07:00,757
Sounds like Sheldon
was a handful.

158
00:07:00,759 --> 00:07:02,392
Oh, he was a handful.

159
00:07:02,394 --> 00:07:05,295
I was a handful.

160
00:07:05,297 --> 00:07:07,530
You still are.

161
00:07:10,534 --> 00:07:13,870
Uh, Mom, hey,
tell Mary the story

162
00:07:13,872 --> 00:07:16,573
about how I made
a Van de Graaff generator

163
00:07:16,575 --> 00:07:18,141
out of our vacuum cleaner.

164
00:07:18,143 --> 00:07:19,342
All right.

165
00:07:19,344 --> 00:07:22,178
He broke the
vacuum cleaner.

166
00:07:28,018 --> 00:07:31,054
I mean, for a while,
everything was vampires.

167
00:07:31,056 --> 00:07:32,689
Now it's all zombies.

168
00:07:32,691 --> 00:07:35,325
I wonder what the next
monster fad will be.

169
00:07:35,327 --> 00:07:37,861
We haven't had a good
invisible man in a while.

170
00:07:37,863 --> 00:07:40,830
Clearly, you've never seen me
try to talk to a woman.

171
00:07:42,032 --> 00:07:43,967
Guys.

172
00:07:43,969 --> 00:07:46,469
In the time you've been sitting
here playing video games,

173
00:07:46,471 --> 00:07:48,538
I got the car washed,
picked up cleaning supplies

174
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:49,873
and went to the bank.

175
00:07:49,875 --> 00:07:52,642
I put on pants.

176
00:07:52,644 --> 00:07:54,844
Kiss-ass.

177
00:07:57,415 --> 00:07:59,849
Okay, I don't know when
I became the mother

178
00:07:59,851 --> 00:08:01,050
to three lazy teenagers,

179
00:08:01,052 --> 00:08:02,285
but it stops today.

180
00:08:02,287 --> 00:08:04,788
You guys are cleaning
the kitchen, top to bottom.

181
00:08:04,790 --> 00:08:07,524
Hey, I don't even live here.

182
00:08:07,526 --> 00:08:10,493
Yes or no, do you have clothes
in my laundry right now?

183
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:12,996
I do.

184
00:08:13,998 --> 00:08:15,365
And some of it's wool,

185
00:08:15,367 --> 00:08:17,400
so dry flat if possible.

186
00:08:19,737 --> 00:08:22,071
Oh, and here's a picture
of me receiving

187
00:08:22,073 --> 00:08:23,840
my bachelor of science degree.

188
00:08:23,842 --> 00:08:26,276
You don't look
very happy.

189
00:08:26,278 --> 00:08:28,812
Well, I had just begun puberty.

190
00:08:30,482 --> 00:08:32,682
It was figuratively
and literally

191
00:08:32,684 --> 00:08:35,251
one of the hairiest moments
of my life.

192
00:08:36,353 --> 00:08:38,521
Shelly does not like change.

193
00:08:38,523 --> 00:08:39,789
Oh, true.

194
00:08:39,791 --> 00:08:41,858
But all the clenching
in the world will not keep

195
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:44,093
testicles in your abdomen.

196
00:08:45,463 --> 00:08:48,031
Hey, sorry,
got caught up at work.

197
00:08:48,033 --> 00:08:48,965
Hi, Beverly!

198
00:08:48,967 --> 00:08:50,233
Hello.

199
00:08:50,235 --> 00:08:52,202
Oh, okay.

200
00:08:53,205 --> 00:08:54,437
Sorry, I forgot.

201
00:08:54,439 --> 00:08:55,939
You remember my mother.

202
00:08:55,941 --> 00:08:56,873
Oh, yes. Hi, Mary!

203
00:08:56,875 --> 00:08:58,908
Good to see you
again, dear.

204
00:08:58,910 --> 00:09:00,877
Ah, yeah, now that's
what I'm talking about.

205
00:09:02,179 --> 00:09:04,848
So, Mom, you haven't seen Penny
since we got engaged.

206
00:09:04,850 --> 00:09:06,916
Oh, yeah, let me
show you the ring.

207
00:09:06,918 --> 00:09:08,218
Oh, lovely.

208
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:10,086
Must have been
very expensive.

209
00:09:10,088 --> 00:09:11,221
Oh, no, not at all.

210
00:09:11,223 --> 00:09:13,389
No, we, uh, found
a place online

211
00:09:13,391 --> 00:09:16,292
that, uh, repurposes
diamond drill bits.

212
00:09:18,395 --> 00:09:20,763
We did not. That's not true.

213
00:09:20,765 --> 00:09:24,100
Can I speak to you alone
for a second?

214
00:09:24,102 --> 00:09:25,568
Oh, sure.

215
00:09:25,570 --> 00:09:27,604
It came from Tiffany's.

216
00:09:27,606 --> 00:09:28,938
You mean the box, right?

217
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:30,273
Keep walking!

218
00:09:33,043 --> 00:09:37,146
Really doesn't matter to me
how much he spent on the ring.

219
00:09:37,148 --> 00:09:39,215
I think.

220
00:09:39,217 --> 00:09:41,718
Did I misspeak
about the ring?

221
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:43,686
Yes, and we'll get
back to that.

222
00:09:43,688 --> 00:09:45,522
But, uh, even with
your mother here,

223
00:09:45,524 --> 00:09:49,359
you are deliberately hogging
all the attention from my mom.

224
00:09:49,361 --> 00:09:50,927
You're like one of those
elephant seal pups

225
00:09:50,929 --> 00:09:53,663
that steals the milk
from two mothers!

226
00:09:53,665 --> 00:09:55,965
Do you mean
what marine biologists

227
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:58,735
refer to as "super weaning"?

228
00:09:58,737 --> 00:10:01,638
Yes, you are a super weaner!

229
00:10:04,608 --> 00:10:06,643
Well, now I have to correct you.

230
00:10:06,645 --> 00:10:09,579
A-As a bit
of an elephant seal buff,

231
00:10:09,581 --> 00:10:11,114
the more accurate
comparison

232
00:10:11,116 --> 00:10:13,149
would be when two mother seals

233
00:10:13,151 --> 00:10:15,451
actively seek
to nourish the same pup.

234
00:10:15,453 --> 00:10:17,720
So I believe the term
you're looking for

235
00:10:17,722 --> 00:10:21,524
is a double mother suckler.

236
00:10:21,526 --> 00:10:23,726
Yeah, you're right.

237
00:10:23,728 --> 00:10:25,461
That is the term
I'm looking for.

238
00:10:25,463 --> 00:10:28,932
You are a dirty double
mother suckler!

239
00:10:30,968 --> 00:10:33,770
Okay, well, now that we have the
terminology straightened out.

240
00:10:33,772 --> 00:10:36,005
How dare you!

241
00:10:37,608 --> 00:10:38,942
We're not in a rush.

242
00:10:38,944 --> 00:10:40,810
We'll set a date when
the time is right.

243
00:10:40,812 --> 00:10:42,145
It doesn't matter, sweetie.

244
00:10:42,147 --> 00:10:43,813
The moment a man lays
with a woman,

245
00:10:43,815 --> 00:10:45,982
they are married
in the eyes of the Lord.

246
00:10:45,984 --> 00:10:47,450
Uch.

247
00:10:55,681 --> 00:10:56,848
"Uch"?

248
00:10:56,850 --> 00:10:58,583
The bible is "uch" to you?

249
00:10:58,585 --> 00:10:59,684
No, I'm sorry.

250
00:10:59,686 --> 00:11:01,019
That was inappropriate.

251
00:11:01,021 --> 00:11:03,521
As a psychiatrist,
I know how important

252
00:11:03,523 --> 00:11:06,024
people's superstitions
can be to them.

253
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:10,495
You want to talk
about superstitions?

254
00:11:10,497 --> 00:11:12,430
Sheldon sent me
the books you wrote...

255
00:11:12,432 --> 00:11:14,832
all that nonsense
about superegos and ids.

256
00:11:14,834 --> 00:11:18,436
What bull dropped that
on the barn floor?

257
00:11:18,438 --> 00:11:21,339
His name is Sigmund Freud.

258
00:11:21,341 --> 00:11:22,540
Hey, look at that!

259
00:11:22,542 --> 00:11:25,944
You both believe in
Jewish bearded guys.

260
00:11:25,946 --> 00:11:27,946
Stay out of this.

261
00:11:27,948 --> 00:11:29,881
Mm-hmm.

262
00:11:29,883 --> 00:11:31,950
At least the bearded man
that I believe in

263
00:11:31,952 --> 00:11:34,085
preaches love and compassion.

264
00:11:34,087 --> 00:11:35,486
All yours
talks about is

265
00:11:35,488 --> 00:11:36,955
why you hold in your poop

266
00:11:36,957 --> 00:11:40,158
and want to crawl back
inside your mama.

267
00:11:42,027 --> 00:11:44,162
It's fascinating.

268
00:11:44,164 --> 00:11:46,664
How can someone
as enlightened as Sheldon

269
00:11:46,666 --> 00:11:49,767
come from someone like you?

270
00:11:49,769 --> 00:11:51,402
I know the answer.

271
00:11:51,404 --> 00:11:52,670
You're not gonna like it.

272
00:11:52,672 --> 00:11:55,106
Try me.

273
00:11:55,108 --> 00:11:57,442
When I was pregnant with Shelly,
I was driving to church,

274
00:11:57,444 --> 00:11:58,943
and I was praying
to the Lord

275
00:11:58,945 --> 00:12:02,947
to give me a son smarter
than his dumb-ass daddy.

276
00:12:03,949 --> 00:12:07,185
And I looked over
and I saw a Jesus bobblehead

277
00:12:07,187 --> 00:12:10,655
in the Subaru next to me
nodding yes.

278
00:12:17,529 --> 00:12:19,264
What is that supposed to mean?

279
00:12:19,266 --> 00:12:23,468
It means... I can't believe
we're having this conversation.

280
00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:24,702
Well, do it some more.

281
00:12:24,704 --> 00:12:27,939
Maybe you can knock
some sense into yourself.

282
00:12:27,941 --> 00:12:30,275
Why don't we all stops
hitting ourselves

283
00:12:30,277 --> 00:12:31,943
and talk about something
safe, you know,

284
00:12:31,945 --> 00:12:36,314
like shoes or how cute
little Chise babies are.

285
00:12:36,316 --> 00:12:37,882
It is not my fault
that your mother likes me

286
00:12:37,884 --> 00:12:39,751
better than she likes you!
Oh, don't flatter yourself!

287
00:12:39,753 --> 00:12:42,987
She likes everybody
better than she likes me!

288
00:12:49,295 --> 00:12:50,928
How old is this Jell-O?

289
00:12:50,930 --> 00:12:55,199
Well, it's carrots,
so gonna say very.

290
00:12:56,869 --> 00:12:58,536
Sorry we have to do this.

291
00:12:58,538 --> 00:13:00,305
Bernadette's not wrong.

292
00:13:00,307 --> 00:13:02,106
She does work hard around here.

293
00:13:02,108 --> 00:13:03,341
Yeah, maybe it's a good thing

294
00:13:03,343 --> 00:13:05,176
if she stops
babying you so much.

295
00:13:05,178 --> 00:13:07,245
She doesn't baby me.

296
00:13:07,247 --> 00:13:09,681
I saw her pull you home
in a wagon.

297
00:13:09,683 --> 00:13:12,050
For your information,

298
00:13:12,052 --> 00:13:15,953
I twisted my ankle
chasing the ice cream truck.

299
00:13:15,955 --> 00:13:18,523
Face it, dude, Bernadette
treats you the same way

300
00:13:18,525 --> 00:13:22,126
your mother used to, and that
was not a healthy relationship.

301
00:13:23,896 --> 00:13:25,663
You're right.

302
00:13:25,665 --> 00:13:26,998
It's time for me

303
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:31,235
to act like an adult
in this marriage.

304
00:13:31,237 --> 00:13:35,573
Starting with my husbandly duty
of taking out the trash.

305
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:44,582
Bernie, I made a mess!

306
00:13:47,419 --> 00:13:50,688
I'm terribly sorry
that I upset your mother.

307
00:13:50,690 --> 00:13:52,357
Oh, it's all right.
She'll forgive you.

308
00:13:52,359 --> 00:13:55,660
She has to or
she goes to hell.

309
00:13:58,263 --> 00:13:59,964
I can't help but notice

310
00:13:59,966 --> 00:14:02,633
how her unconditional
love for you

311
00:14:02,635 --> 00:14:06,270
is diametrically opposed
to my own parenting strategies.

312
00:14:06,272 --> 00:14:09,240
Well, you doled
out affection

313
00:14:09,242 --> 00:14:12,043
as a reward for
achievement...

314
00:14:12,045 --> 00:14:14,345
a proven way to
raise a child.

315
00:14:14,347 --> 00:14:16,981
Or train a rat.

316
00:14:16,983 --> 00:14:18,850
But look how well
you turned out.

317
00:14:18,852 --> 00:14:23,221
I'd feign modesty at this point,
but who would believe me?

318
00:14:23,223 --> 00:14:25,022
Still, you need
to consider

319
00:14:25,024 --> 00:14:27,759
how successful Leonard's
brother and sister are.

320
00:14:27,761 --> 00:14:29,460
I suppose.

321
00:14:29,462 --> 00:14:33,598
While my brother and sister
are mouth-breathing idiots.

322
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:36,601
Do you suppose
you would've flourished more

323
00:14:36,603 --> 00:14:38,202
in a reward-based environment?

324
00:14:38,204 --> 00:14:40,505
Perhaps.

325
00:14:40,507 --> 00:14:43,408
But my mom made me spaghetti
with chopped-up hot dogs

326
00:14:43,410 --> 00:14:46,411
whenever I wanted,
so who cares?

327
00:14:48,347 --> 00:14:52,150
Not once did my mother ever
give me any love or affection

328
00:14:52,152 --> 00:14:54,318
for just being myself;
I always had to earn it.

329
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,286
Oh, Leonard,

330
00:14:55,288 --> 00:14:57,722
I'm sure she loves you
very much.

331
00:14:57,724 --> 00:15:01,359
In her own cold godless way.

332
00:15:01,361 --> 00:15:05,229
Yeah, and you certainly don't
have to earn my love.

333
00:15:05,231 --> 00:15:06,397
Thank you.

334
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:07,832
Of course,
you already knew that

335
00:15:07,834 --> 00:15:11,569
when you bought me
this princess-cut drill bit.

336
00:15:11,571 --> 00:15:13,671
That's not what it is.

337
00:15:13,673 --> 00:15:15,740
I know, I know.

338
00:15:17,844 --> 00:15:20,511
When your mom gets back,
I'm gonna need

339
00:15:20,513 --> 00:15:22,613
to apologize for the way
I spoke to her.

340
00:15:22,615 --> 00:15:24,582
Well, come on now,
she did kind of start it.

341
00:15:24,584 --> 00:15:27,452
Doesn't matter; a good Christian
would've turned the other cheek.

342
00:15:27,454 --> 00:15:28,553
On the other hand,

343
00:15:28,555 --> 00:15:31,556
a good Texan
would've shot her, so...

344
00:15:34,092 --> 00:15:36,894
I just kind of
split the difference.

345
00:15:36,896 --> 00:15:39,964
Hey, who's in the mood
for spaghetti and hot dogs?

346
00:15:39,966 --> 00:15:41,332
Oh, me!
Yeah, me, too!

347
00:15:41,334 --> 00:15:43,334
Coming up.

348
00:15:43,336 --> 00:15:46,671
I don't really
feel I deserve it.

349
00:15:49,074 --> 00:15:51,175
That was a big
sticky mess,

350
00:15:51,177 --> 00:15:52,877
but... I think I got it.

351
00:15:52,879 --> 00:15:54,011
Looks good.
Yeah.

352
00:15:54,013 --> 00:15:55,680
Look at that.

353
00:15:55,682 --> 00:15:57,715
You cleaned it up
all by yourself.

354
00:15:57,717 --> 00:16:00,852
Yes, I cleaned it up
all by myself.

355
00:16:00,854 --> 00:16:02,887
Honestly, I don't know
why you complain so...

356
00:16:04,423 --> 00:16:06,157
Okay, maybe I missed one spot.

357
00:16:12,498 --> 00:16:14,665
Just leave.

358
00:16:17,569 --> 00:16:19,170
I'm so glad
that you and I were able

359
00:16:19,172 --> 00:16:21,205
to bury the hatchet.
Me, too.

360
00:16:21,207 --> 00:16:23,407
And I respect your right
to your beliefs.

361
00:16:23,409 --> 00:16:25,943
And I will
pray for you.

362
00:16:27,813 --> 00:16:30,081
Okay, Mom, let's get you
back to your hotel

363
00:16:30,083 --> 00:16:31,716
before anyone says
anything else.

364
00:16:31,718 --> 00:16:32,917
One moment.

365
00:16:32,919 --> 00:16:35,786
There's something
I need to say to you.

366
00:16:35,788 --> 00:16:38,322
Oh, really? That's too bad.

367
00:16:38,324 --> 00:16:42,093
Leonard, I always
made you earn my affection,

368
00:16:42,095 --> 00:16:43,427
but today I realize

369
00:16:43,429 --> 00:16:46,397
that there's more than one way
to raise a child.

370
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:49,534
I taught her that!

371
00:16:49,536 --> 00:16:51,068
Therefore, I would like

372
00:16:51,070 --> 00:16:54,872
to initiate a new protocol
wherein I...

373
00:16:54,874 --> 00:16:58,175
shower you
with unconditional love.

374
00:16:58,177 --> 00:17:00,611
Wow.

375
00:17:00,613 --> 00:17:02,046
When does that start?

376
00:17:02,048 --> 00:17:05,216
So needy.

377
00:17:09,187 --> 00:17:11,956
Come to Mommy.

378
00:17:12,824 --> 00:17:15,226
It's okay, go ahead.

379
00:17:22,601 --> 00:17:25,703
Oh, my son.

380
00:17:27,205 --> 00:17:29,707
Oh, my mother.

381
00:17:29,709 --> 00:17:32,043
Oh, my God.
