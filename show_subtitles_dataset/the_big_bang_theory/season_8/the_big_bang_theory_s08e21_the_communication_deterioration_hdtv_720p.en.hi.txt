00:00:02,719 --> 00:00:04,585
Hey, would you like
to hear some songs

2
00:00:04,588 --> 00:00:08,056
I've rewritten to get children
interested in the hard sciences?

3
00:00:08,058 --> 00:00:09,258
Sure.
Really?

4
00:00:09,259 --> 00:00:11,259
Yeah. Well, I like
music, I like science,

5
00:00:11,261 --> 00:00:14,363
I like making fun
of Sheldon. Hit it.

Thank you.

21

Do either of you know Beyoncé?

22
00:00:54,338 --> 00:00:56,271
I'd love her to get behind it.

23
00:00:56,272 --> 00:00:58,140
Hey.

24
00:00:58,141 --> 00:00:59,573
Hey. - Hey.
Hello.

25
00:00:59,576 --> 00:01:01,543
You guys know the new
Discovery class missions

26
00:01:01,545 --> 00:01:02,911
that NASA's been working on?
Yeah.

27
00:01:02,912 --> 00:01:05,146
Well, they're looking
to include a message from Earth

28
00:01:05,149 --> 00:01:07,924
in case one of them
is encountered by alien life.

29
00:01:07,947 --> 00:01:08,582
Oh.

30
00:01:08,584 --> 00:01:10,584
When I encountered alien life,
I-I discovered

31
00:01:10,587 --> 00:01:14,122
that the key thing
was not to sit in its spot.

32
00:01:14,123 --> 00:01:17,893
All right, you can't breathe
our air without an inhaler,

33
00:01:17,894 --> 00:01:19,694
he's allergic
to Earth nuts,

34
00:01:19,697 --> 00:01:20,861
but I'm the alien.

35
00:01:20,864 --> 00:01:22,864
Anyway,

36
00:01:22,866 --> 00:01:24,665
I'm among a handful
of scientists

37
00:01:24,668 --> 00:01:27,001
that have been asked to submit
a design proposal

38
00:01:27,003 --> 00:01:29,104
for the message
and its delivery system.

39
00:01:29,105 --> 00:01:31,138
Excellent. - Congratulations.
Good for you.

40
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:33,207
And I was wondering
if any of you guys

41
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:35,110
would like
to help me do it.

42
00:01:35,111 --> 00:01:37,346
Are you kidding? Yes.
What did you have in mind?

43
00:01:37,348 --> 00:01:40,115
I'll tell you exactly what you
avoid the presumption

44
00:01:40,116 --> 00:01:43,150
- of the Terran sensory input paradigm.
- Yeah, absolutely.

45
00:01:43,152 --> 00:01:45,019
You need a device capable
of delivering information

46
00:01:45,021 --> 00:01:47,789
across a wide range
of perceptual modalities.

47
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:50,391
Any intelligent organism
would at the very least need

48
00:01:50,394 --> 00:01:52,728
the ability to locate the
position of objects in space.

49
00:01:52,729 --> 00:01:56,564
So the ideal interstellar
lingua franca would be haptic.

50
00:01:56,567 --> 00:01:58,667
Ooh, how about a 3-D
tactile communicator rigged

51
00:01:58,668 --> 00:02:00,334
for cross-sensory transposition?

52
00:02:00,337 --> 00:02:01,435
Exactly what I expected.

53
00:02:01,438 --> 00:02:03,138
Two people
forcing their ideas on me

54
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:05,039
and only one gentleman
who could be bothered

55
00:02:05,042 --> 00:02:06,507
to ask me what my thoughts were.

56
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:08,543
You two are out.
Congratulations, Leonard,

57
00:02:08,544 --> 00:02:10,312
you're on the team.

69
00:02:43,334 --> 00:02:45,034
Hey. Thanks
for coming by.

70
00:02:45,037 --> 00:02:46,736
Yeah. I'm excited to help.

71
00:02:46,739 --> 00:02:48,472
I would have included
the others, but...

72
00:02:48,473 --> 00:02:50,039
you know exactly
what would've happened.

73
00:02:50,042 --> 00:02:52,476
They would've taken over the
project and bossed us around.

74
00:02:52,478 --> 00:02:53,943
I get it.

75
00:02:53,945 --> 00:02:56,479
Uh, just this morning, Sheldon
wouldn't let me put almond milk

76
00:02:56,482 --> 00:02:57,715
on my Grape-Nuts because he said

77
00:02:57,717 --> 00:03:00,784
it was
a theoretical nut conflict.

78
00:03:00,787 --> 00:03:03,153
You should have told him
to mind his own business.

79
00:03:03,156 --> 00:03:05,656
Yeah. That's better
than what I did say, which was,

80
00:03:05,657 --> 00:03:08,425
“Fine, I'll eat them
with club soda.”

81
00:03:08,427 --> 00:03:12,028
What makes them think they're
always in charge of everything?

82
00:03:12,031 --> 00:03:13,197
Mmm, they're alpha males.

83
00:03:13,198 --> 00:03:14,799
What does that make us?

84
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,933
We could be betas.
They're second in charge.

85
00:03:16,936 --> 00:03:17,901
Okay, that sounds good.

86
00:03:17,903 --> 00:03:19,135
Or we could be omegas.

87
00:03:19,138 --> 00:03:21,906
They get pushed around
by the alphas and the betas.

88
00:03:21,907 --> 00:03:24,241
Okay, that sounds like us.

89
00:03:24,242 --> 00:03:26,509
Whatever. There's
no alphas here,

90
00:03:26,512 --> 00:03:28,311
and this is
your project.

91
00:03:28,313 --> 00:03:30,381
You're in charge.
How do you want to start?

92
00:03:30,383 --> 00:03:33,417
I don't know.
How do you want to start?

93
00:03:34,253 --> 00:03:36,686
I don't know.

94
00:03:40,025 --> 00:03:42,525
Should we call Sheldon
and Howard?

95
00:03:42,527 --> 00:03:44,194
No. We can do this by ourselves.

96
00:03:44,197 --> 00:03:45,930
Okay. Great.
How do you want to start?

97
00:03:45,931 --> 00:03:47,531
I don't know.
How do you want to start?

98
00:03:53,171 --> 00:03:55,205
Sheldon. Sheldon.

99
00:03:55,207 --> 00:03:57,373
Sheldon.

100
00:04:03,682 --> 00:04:06,584
I bet that started off
as a joke,

101
00:04:06,585 --> 00:04:09,220
but by the third one
you realized

102
00:04:09,222 --> 00:04:12,923
there was something
strangely enjoyable about it.

103
00:04:12,925 --> 00:04:16,426
Yeah, I kind of want
to do it again.

104
00:04:16,429 --> 00:04:19,128
I don't recommend it. You'll be
doing it the rest of your life.

105
00:04:20,866 --> 00:04:23,734
Anyway, if you're looking for
Leonard, he's with Koothrappali.

106
00:04:23,736 --> 00:04:25,369
Uh, no, I actually came
to talk to you.

107
00:04:25,371 --> 00:04:27,804
How nice.

108
00:04:29,174 --> 00:04:30,808
Here are some topics
that interest me:

109
00:04:30,809 --> 00:04:34,078
quantum mechanics, trains, flags...
No, no.

110
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,446
It's about my acting career.
Oh, sorry.

111
00:04:36,448 --> 00:04:37,748
That's not on the list.

112
00:04:37,749 --> 00:04:39,416
Well...
Oh, wait. No.

113
00:04:39,417 --> 00:04:40,583
How about
we split

114
00:04:40,585 --> 00:04:43,587
the difference
and discuss why Austria

115
00:04:43,589 --> 00:04:47,258
was an archduchy
and not just a regular duchy.

116
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:50,260
Okay, look, here's the thing.
I like pharmaceutical sales—

117
00:04:50,263 --> 00:04:52,563
it's going great— but I have
an audition for a movie,

118
00:04:52,565 --> 00:04:54,597
and if I get it,
it could screw everything up.

119
00:04:54,599 --> 00:04:57,868
Hmm. I know
exactly what you should do.

120
00:04:57,869 --> 00:05:00,304
Unfortunately,
I cannot tell you.

121
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:03,806
Well, why?

122
00:05:03,808 --> 00:05:05,808
I'm attempting
to turn over a new leaf.

123
00:05:05,811 --> 00:05:07,578
Earlier today,
it was pointed out to me

124
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:10,179
that I tend to force my ideas
on people.

125
00:05:11,583 --> 00:05:13,551
You're really
not gonna tell me?

126
00:05:13,553 --> 00:05:16,787
No, that train has left
the station.

127
00:05:16,789 --> 00:05:18,054
Now, we can
play this

128
00:05:18,056 --> 00:05:19,256
one of two ways.

129
00:05:19,258 --> 00:05:22,025
You can say,
“Trains, tell me more,”

130
00:05:22,027 --> 00:05:23,126
or...

131
00:05:23,128 --> 00:05:25,262
you can just look at me
like that

132
00:05:25,263 --> 00:05:27,131
and I'll start.

133
00:05:31,203 --> 00:05:32,902
What's going on
in here?

134
00:05:32,905 --> 00:05:35,839
I am making molecular cocktails.

135
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:39,609
This sphere is actually
a cosmopolitan.

136
00:05:39,611 --> 00:05:40,744
Oh.

137
00:05:40,746 --> 00:05:41,945
How do you drink it?

138
00:05:41,948 --> 00:05:45,049
Oh, just put it in your
mouth and pop it like a zit.

139
00:05:46,419 --> 00:05:48,719
I think I'll have a beer.

140
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,186
First take a
picture with me.

141
00:05:50,188 --> 00:05:50,972
Why?

142
00:05:50,996 --> 00:05:53,256
Well, Raj and I always
talked about learning

143
00:05:53,258 --> 00:05:57,661
how to make cocktails like this
together, so I taught myself

144
00:05:57,662 --> 00:06:00,464
and I'm putting this on
Instagram so he can see it

145
00:06:00,465 --> 00:06:03,967
and feel like a turd.
Say cheese.

146
00:06:03,970 --> 00:06:06,736
Is this about the space probe
he's working on without you?

147
00:06:06,739 --> 00:06:08,304
You betcha. The very one.

148
00:06:10,176 --> 00:06:11,708
Howard, you're grown men.

149
00:06:11,710 --> 00:06:13,811
You guys don't have
to do everything together.

150
00:06:13,813 --> 00:06:17,780
I know. That's why I'm
spending tonight with you.

151
00:06:17,782 --> 00:06:19,917
Trying to hurt Raj's feelings.

152
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:22,018
With my honeybunch.

153
00:06:22,888 --> 00:06:24,755
You're being childish.

154
00:06:24,756 --> 00:06:26,623
No. He is.

155
00:06:26,626 --> 00:06:28,926
So I have a dominant
personality.

156
00:06:28,927 --> 00:06:30,861
We all know that.

157
00:06:31,696 --> 00:06:34,263
I'm sorry. What do we know?

158
00:06:34,265 --> 00:06:36,232
In social groupings,

159
00:06:36,234 --> 00:06:40,436
I just naturally wind up
in charge.

160
00:06:40,438 --> 00:06:42,373
Don't take this the wrong way,
but how many

161
00:06:42,374 --> 00:06:44,842
of these little booze balls
have you had?

162
00:06:45,677 --> 00:06:47,477
You don't think I'm a leader?

163
00:06:47,479 --> 00:06:49,946
I was kidding.
Of course you are.

164
00:06:49,948 --> 00:06:52,148
Right. I couldn't change
if I wanted to.

165
00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:55,284
You better not change,
because I love who you are.

166
00:06:55,287 --> 00:06:57,888
Now, will you need help cleaning
all this up when you're done

167
00:06:57,890 --> 00:06:59,857
or can you do it
all by yourself?

168
00:06:59,859 --> 00:07:01,392
All by myself.

169
00:07:01,393 --> 00:07:03,693
There's my big boss man.

170
00:07:06,965 --> 00:07:10,600
So, often on the front
of the locomotive

171
00:07:10,602 --> 00:07:13,604
is a large iron wedge

172
00:07:13,606 --> 00:07:16,006
for clearing objects
off the tracks.

173
00:07:16,008 --> 00:07:18,775
Now, while commonly
known as a cowcatcher,

174
00:07:18,777 --> 00:07:22,780
I prefer the more
accurate “cow exploder"

175
00:07:24,015 --> 00:07:26,749
Okay. Sheldon,
let me ask you a question.

176
00:07:26,751 --> 00:07:28,951
Mmm.
If I was at a train station

177
00:07:28,953 --> 00:07:31,554
and one train could take me
to my current job

178
00:07:31,556 --> 00:07:34,590
and the other train could take
me to an audition for a movie,

179
00:07:34,592 --> 00:07:36,960
which train should I get on?

180
00:07:39,431 --> 00:07:44,301
Are you using trains to trick me
into giving you advice?

181
00:07:44,302 --> 00:07:46,970
No.

182
00:07:46,972 --> 00:07:49,606
All right, then.

183
00:07:49,607 --> 00:07:51,874
You should take a third train

184
00:07:51,876 --> 00:07:54,210
where you audition
for the movie

185
00:07:54,212 --> 00:07:56,246
but hold off
on making a career decision

186
00:07:56,248 --> 00:07:58,082
until you have more information.

187
00:07:58,083 --> 00:07:59,749
Oh. You're right.

188
00:07:59,751 --> 00:08:02,152
I'm worried about something
that hasn't even happened yet.

189
00:08:02,154 --> 00:08:03,520
Huh.

190
00:08:03,522 --> 00:08:06,256
You are a wise man.

191
00:08:06,258 --> 00:08:08,424
Well, Penny, who's smarter:
the wise man

192
00:08:08,426 --> 00:08:12,796
or the person who comes to him
for advice?

193
00:08:13,631 --> 00:08:15,566
Oh, I guess you're right.

194
00:08:15,568 --> 00:08:17,801
Maybe it is the person who asks.

195
00:08:17,802 --> 00:08:20,270
No, it's the wise man.

196
00:08:23,475 --> 00:08:26,977
That's why he's called
the wise man.

197
00:08:26,979 --> 00:08:29,345
You know how I know that?

198
00:08:29,347 --> 00:08:31,815
I'm the wise man.

199
00:08:32,851 --> 00:08:35,152
I'm sorry. What was I thinking?

200
00:08:35,153 --> 00:08:36,720
Uh, just out
of curiosity,

201
00:08:36,721 --> 00:08:38,787
why didn't you ask Leonard
for advice about this?

202
00:08:39,258 --> 00:08:40,691
'Cause I already know
what he'll say.

203
00:08:40,692 --> 00:08:43,726
“Wah, wah, wah,
you shouldn't do it.”

204
00:08:43,729 --> 00:08:46,162
It's just like he's here!

205
00:08:48,667 --> 00:08:50,633
Okay, so we know
that previous attempts

206
00:08:50,635 --> 00:08:52,802
to send a message into space,
like the Golden Record

207
00:08:52,805 --> 00:08:55,004
on Voyager,
were heavily criticized.

208
00:08:55,007 --> 00:08:56,606
Well, aliens could only play
the Golden Record

209
00:08:56,609 --> 00:08:58,609
if they figured out
how to build a record player.

210
00:08:58,610 --> 00:09:01,945
Eh. Although, to be fair,
I watched E.T. build a telephone

211
00:09:01,946 --> 00:09:04,314
out of a Speak & Spell
and an umbrella.

212
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:08,317
Dude was like
a little brown MacGyver.

213
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,521
That would be more helpful
if E.T. were real.

214
00:09:10,522 --> 00:09:15,625
Well, my feelings were real
when he was about to die.

215
00:09:15,628 --> 00:09:20,096
My God, when he's on the table
and they use the paddles on him.

216
00:09:20,099 --> 00:09:21,431
And he's all white.

217
00:09:21,432 --> 00:09:23,200
They zip him up in that bag.

218
00:09:23,201 --> 00:09:25,936
And Gertie can't stop crying.

219
00:09:25,937 --> 00:09:27,671
The flower dies.

220
00:09:27,672 --> 00:09:30,106
Okay, let's talk
about something else.

221
00:09:30,109 --> 00:09:32,475
All right, all right.
So it-it sounds

222
00:09:32,478 --> 00:09:34,945
like we need a way
to communicate that's simple.

223
00:09:34,946 --> 00:09:36,946
And doesn't require
outside machinery

224
00:09:36,949 --> 00:09:38,415
to be built to access it.

225
00:09:38,417 --> 00:09:40,450
It's also a problem
because we don't even know

226
00:09:40,451 --> 00:09:42,219
if the aliens
who find this can see.

227
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:43,420
I mean, they might
communicate

228
00:09:43,421 --> 00:09:45,122
in a totally
different way than us.

229
00:09:45,123 --> 00:09:47,090
Like when my dog is mad at me,

230
00:09:47,091 --> 00:09:49,993
she tells me
by peeing in my slippers.

231
00:09:49,994 --> 00:09:53,497
That's actually a valid example.

232
00:09:53,498 --> 00:09:56,166
Animals do deliver messages
through scent.

233
00:09:56,167 --> 00:09:57,935
Bees talk to each other
by dancing.

234
00:09:57,936 --> 00:09:59,101
Whales have their songs.

235
00:09:59,104 --> 00:10:01,705
Penny has about 20 different
ways of rolling her eyes

236
00:10:01,706 --> 00:10:03,840
that each mean
something different.

237
00:10:03,843 --> 00:10:06,343
Okay, so, what it
sounds like is,

238
00:10:06,345 --> 00:10:07,677
what we want is a device

239
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,812
that can deliver a message
through not only sight,

240
00:10:09,815 --> 00:10:11,215
but other senses, as well.

241
00:10:11,216 --> 00:10:14,383
The most basic sense that any
space-faring civilization

242
00:10:14,386 --> 00:10:16,452
would have to possess is touch.

243
00:10:16,455 --> 00:10:18,488
Ooh. Ooh, ooh!

244
00:10:18,489 --> 00:10:20,724
We could make
a video-playing device

245
00:10:20,725 --> 00:10:22,825
that simultaneously translates
the information

246
00:10:22,827 --> 00:10:24,561
into a tactile medium.

247
00:10:24,562 --> 00:10:27,196
All we have to do is rig up
a 3-D communication system!

248
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:28,297
We-we can totally do that!

249
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:29,966
I know!
This is great!

250
00:10:29,969 --> 00:10:31,133
Yeah, you know what else it is?
What?

251
00:10:31,136 --> 00:10:32,936
Exactly what Sheldon
and Howard said.

252
00:10:35,273 --> 00:10:37,907
Well, thank you
for peeing in my slippers.

Hang on. Not that your song
isn't terrible— it is...

258
00:11:01,239 --> 00:11:05,008
but how do you mention bats
and leave out sonar?

259
00:11:05,011 --> 00:11:06,944
You didn't let me finish.

260
00:11:06,945 --> 00:11:10,980
♪ And also regarding the bat ♪

261
00:11:10,983 --> 00:11:13,316

Hey.

263
00:11:16,321 --> 00:11:17,455
Hello.

264
00:11:17,456 --> 00:11:19,623
Look,

265
00:11:19,624 --> 00:11:22,625
I know you guys are upset,
but we've talked about it,

266
00:11:22,628 --> 00:11:24,161
and we think it'd be beneficial

267
00:11:24,162 --> 00:11:26,464
for you to be part
of the project.

268
00:11:27,432 --> 00:11:30,901
Well, well, well,
did you hear that, Sheldon?

269
00:11:30,902 --> 00:11:33,369
I'm sorry. I was trying
to think of what rhymes

270
00:11:33,372 --> 00:11:36,006
with “nose of the aardvark.”

271
00:11:36,008 --> 00:11:37,340
We want you

272
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:39,442
back on the project with us.

273
00:11:39,445 --> 00:11:44,514
Well, well, well, did
you hear that, Howard?

274
00:11:44,517 --> 00:11:45,782
Look, we admit it.

275
00:11:45,785 --> 00:11:48,319
The idea that you guys came
up with was really good,

276
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,320
and I'd love
your help.

277
00:11:50,322 --> 00:11:53,324
I suppose it couldn't have been
easy for you to say that.

278
00:11:53,325 --> 00:11:56,426
It wasn't, so...
are you in?

279
00:11:57,997 --> 00:11:59,363
Certainly.
Sure. Great.

280
00:11:59,364 --> 00:12:01,665
Now that we're all
on the same page,

281
00:12:01,667 --> 00:12:03,466
let's get together tonight
and work on it.

282
00:12:03,469 --> 00:12:04,667
“Get together tonight”?

283
00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:06,136
Leonard, stop trying
to control everything,

284
00:12:06,138 --> 00:12:08,839
and give poor Raj a chance to
come up with what we should do.

285
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:09,940
Go ahead, Raj.

286
00:12:09,941 --> 00:12:11,841
Okay, I think
we should do it right now.

287
00:12:11,844 --> 00:12:13,244
Tonight works better for me.

288
00:12:13,245 --> 00:12:15,678
Okay.

289
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:23,820
Okay, it's just an audition.

290
00:12:23,822 --> 00:12:25,489
Why am I nervous?

291
00:12:25,490 --> 00:12:26,856
Maybe it's a good thing.

292
00:12:26,859 --> 00:12:28,758
Just means I want it.

293
00:12:28,761 --> 00:12:30,326
And I can have it.

294
00:12:30,329 --> 00:12:31,762
This feels right.

295
00:12:31,763 --> 00:12:33,964
Why did I ever give this up?

296
00:12:37,970 --> 00:12:41,305
I'm starting to remember.

297
00:12:43,441 --> 00:12:46,109
So, I'd like
to try a technique

298
00:12:46,112 --> 00:12:47,777
where no one gets steamrolled.

299
00:12:47,779 --> 00:12:49,312
When you talk,

300
00:12:49,315 --> 00:12:52,248
instead of bringing up
a new idea, respect what was

301
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:55,085
just said by building on it.

302
00:12:55,086 --> 00:12:56,820
Uh, building on that...
Mm-hmm.

303
00:12:56,821 --> 00:12:59,422
we should order dinner.

304
00:12:59,425 --> 00:13:01,724
How is that building
on what he just said?

305
00:13:01,726 --> 00:13:05,229
Building on what Sheldon said,
I could go for Chinese.

306
00:13:05,230 --> 00:13:06,964
Hang on.
Building on what Leonard said,

307
00:13:06,965 --> 00:13:08,364
no one built on what I said.

308
00:13:08,367 --> 00:13:10,301
Building on “building on that"

309
00:13:10,302 --> 00:13:12,636
there's a new build-your-own
pizza place on Colorado.

310
00:13:13,772 --> 00:13:15,205
Building on that,
I'd like to remind you,

311
00:13:15,206 --> 00:13:16,306
I'm lactose intolerant.

312
00:13:16,308 --> 00:13:18,042
I saw the menu.
They have soy cheese.

313
00:13:18,043 --> 00:13:20,476
Ha, ha! You didn't say
“building on.” You're out!

314
00:13:20,479 --> 00:13:22,178
It's not Simon Says.

315
00:13:22,181 --> 00:13:23,947
Yeah, you're missing the point, Sheldon.
You're out, and you're out.

316
00:13:23,950 --> 00:13:25,449
I win! Who wants pizza?

317
00:13:29,354 --> 00:13:31,321
Penny?

318
00:13:31,324 --> 00:13:32,690
Oh, hey.
Hey.

319
00:13:32,691 --> 00:13:34,591
I haven't seen you
auditioning in a while.

320
00:13:34,594 --> 00:13:37,360
Yeah, uh, I got a job
as a pharmaceutical sales rep.

321
00:13:37,363 --> 00:13:39,463
You quit acting?
Well, kind of.

322
00:13:39,465 --> 00:13:40,931
But now I get to act like

323
00:13:40,932 --> 00:13:44,768
inflamed heart is only
a “mild side effect.”

324
00:13:44,769 --> 00:13:46,970
I heard you can make
good money doing that.

325
00:13:46,973 --> 00:13:49,840
Yeah, it's going okay,
but I do miss this sometimes.

326
00:13:49,841 --> 00:13:51,374
Really?
Mmm.

327
00:13:51,377 --> 00:13:53,710
'Cause I got to tell
you, I am so sick

328
00:13:53,713 --> 00:13:56,747
of the humiliation and being
treated like a piece of meat.

329
00:13:56,748 --> 00:13:59,782
Chelsea?
Wish me luck.

330
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:03,686
They're gonna
love you.

331
00:14:04,757 --> 00:14:07,958
I heard she's pushing 40
and everything's fake.

332
00:14:08,728 --> 00:14:11,161
Yeah. I started
that rumor.

333
00:14:13,331 --> 00:14:16,032
Okay, since we agree
on the delivery system

334
00:14:16,035 --> 00:14:17,700
for the message,
maybe we should talk

335
00:14:17,702 --> 00:14:18,969
about what the message could be.

336
00:14:18,970 --> 00:14:21,739
Well, I think we should show
what earthlings look like.

337
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:24,273
The plaque they sent up on the
Pioneer probe had a drawing

338
00:14:24,276 --> 00:14:26,009
of a naked man
and woman on it.

339
00:14:26,012 --> 00:14:27,411
Yeah, I never cared for that.

340
00:14:27,412 --> 00:14:29,912
It's advertising
to predator races

341
00:14:29,915 --> 00:14:33,816
just how soft
and squishy we are.

342
00:14:33,819 --> 00:14:35,853
Squeeze yourself!

343
00:14:35,854 --> 00:14:37,086
Oh, don't be offended.

344
00:14:37,089 --> 00:14:38,689
You know, of
the four of us,

345
00:14:38,691 --> 00:14:40,691
you have the most
veal-like consistency.

346
00:14:42,494 --> 00:14:44,695
Well, maybe there's a way
to appear nonaggressive,

347
00:14:44,696 --> 00:14:47,196
but also be able to protect
ourselves if necessary.

348
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:49,733
Like smiling and waving
with one hand,

349
00:14:49,734 --> 00:14:53,103
but the other hand holding
the severed head of a tiger.

350
00:14:53,104 --> 00:14:55,104
You want to send
a passive-aggressive message

351
00:14:55,106 --> 00:14:56,272
out into the universe?

352
00:14:56,274 --> 00:14:57,474
That's ridiculous.

353
00:14:57,475 --> 00:14:59,008
Oh, you mean passive-aggressive

354
00:14:59,010 --> 00:15:01,045
like posting pictures
of you and your wife

355
00:15:01,046 --> 00:15:02,245
eating cosmopolitan balls

356
00:15:02,248 --> 00:15:05,114
that you know belong
in my mouth?

357
00:15:07,052 --> 00:15:08,985
Perhaps Howard meant
passive-aggressive

358
00:15:08,988 --> 00:15:11,622
like asking our group
to help on your project,

359
00:15:11,623 --> 00:15:13,322
and then only
choosing Leonard.

360
00:15:13,325 --> 00:15:16,192
Look, I'm sorry
I hurt your feelings,

361
00:15:16,195 --> 00:15:18,695
but you do have
strong personalities

362
00:15:18,697 --> 00:15:20,631
and always end up taking over.

363
00:15:20,633 --> 00:15:21,931
It's not always.

364
00:15:21,933 --> 00:15:23,734
What about when we went
to Comic-Con

365
00:15:23,735 --> 00:15:25,234
and dressed like Jabba the Hutt?

366
00:15:25,237 --> 00:15:27,738
You got to be Jabba's head,
and I got to be

367
00:15:27,739 --> 00:15:29,940
his fat slug butt.

368
00:15:31,243 --> 00:15:34,177
We looked great.

369
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:36,312
You let a guy sit on me.

370
00:15:36,315 --> 00:15:37,980
He was dressed as Princess Leia.

371
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:40,050
It made a nice picture.

372
00:15:41,887 --> 00:15:45,321
I'm just saying, sometimes Raj
and I feel pushed aside.

373
00:15:45,324 --> 00:15:47,891
Yeah. Like when you
took Sheldon to Texas

374
00:15:47,893 --> 00:15:49,359
and showed him all around NASA—

375
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:51,595
you didn't even think
to ask me and Leonard.

376
00:15:51,596 --> 00:15:53,564
You know what?
You're right.

377
00:15:53,566 --> 00:15:55,264
I should have asked you.

378
00:15:55,267 --> 00:15:57,468
Yeah, and if he does
ask you, go.

379
00:15:57,470 --> 00:15:59,436
It's amazing.

380
00:16:00,572 --> 00:16:01,939
Okay, and if
we're talking

381
00:16:01,941 --> 00:16:03,407
about being left
out of things,

382
00:16:03,408 --> 00:16:05,408
you guys went to Skywalker
Ranch without us.

383
00:16:05,411 --> 00:16:06,810
Oh, I recommend that, too.

384
00:16:06,811 --> 00:16:09,178
That was a magical
experience!

385
00:16:09,181 --> 00:16:10,614
Wait a minute.

386
00:16:10,615 --> 00:16:12,849
Sheldon spent a whole day
with James Earl Jones

387
00:16:12,851 --> 00:16:14,118
and never told any of us.

388
00:16:14,119 --> 00:16:15,985
I sure did.

389
00:16:15,988 --> 00:16:17,421
Oh, my goodness!

390
00:16:17,422 --> 00:16:20,657
Well, from Jabba's head
to ice cream with Darth Vader,

391
00:16:20,658 --> 00:16:22,893
I'm having a heck of a ride.

392
00:16:22,894 --> 00:16:23,926
Yeah, look,

393
00:16:23,928 --> 00:16:25,295
clearly, good
things happen

394
00:16:25,296 --> 00:16:26,696
when I'm in charge.

395
00:16:26,699 --> 00:16:27,965
Now, why don't

396
00:16:27,966 --> 00:16:30,968
you boys step aside,
let me knock this project out?

397
00:16:30,970 --> 00:16:32,136
Sheldon,

398
00:16:32,138 --> 00:16:33,302
you're not in charge.

399
00:16:33,305 --> 00:16:34,604
Raj is in charge.

400
00:16:34,606 --> 00:16:36,739
Leonard, who's
really in charge?

401
00:16:36,742 --> 00:16:41,345
The person in charge, or
those who put him in charge?

402
00:16:41,346 --> 00:16:42,646
He's right.

403
00:16:42,647 --> 00:16:44,882
If you think about it,
we're all in charge.

404
00:16:44,883 --> 00:16:46,416
No, the guy in charge is in...

405
00:16:46,417 --> 00:16:49,385
Why is everyone so bad
at these?

406
00:16:50,489 --> 00:16:52,321
I mean, the whole experience
reminded me

407
00:16:52,324 --> 00:16:54,524
about how much
I hated about that world.

408
00:16:54,527 --> 00:16:56,893
You-you know, the anxiety,
the depression, the negativity.

409
00:16:56,896 --> 00:16:58,896
I don't want
to feel those things.

410
00:16:58,897 --> 00:17:03,133
I want to sell drugs to people
who feel those things.

411
00:17:03,134 --> 00:17:05,434
I can't believe you got up
and walked out

412
00:17:05,437 --> 00:17:07,637
of an audition for a big movie.

413
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:08,905
I did.

414
00:17:08,908 --> 00:17:10,740
I-I mean, I walked in,
read for the part,

415
00:17:10,742 --> 00:17:13,177
then stunk up the place,
but then I walked right out.

416
00:17:14,078 --> 00:17:15,278
Well, I'm glad

417
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:17,314
you have a new
appreciation for your job.

418
00:17:17,316 --> 00:17:19,082
I do, and you know,
I don't think

419
00:17:19,084 --> 00:17:21,184
I've ever thanked you properly
for helping me get it.

420
00:17:21,187 --> 00:17:22,952
Properly, at all.

421
00:17:22,954 --> 00:17:26,088
It's just words
I've never heard.

422
00:17:26,091 --> 00:17:27,223
Well, thank you.

423
00:17:27,226 --> 00:17:29,358
You're a good friend,
and you changed my life.

424
00:17:29,361 --> 00:17:30,928
You're welcome.

425
00:17:30,930 --> 00:17:32,595
Hey, now that
you're making some real money,

426
00:17:32,597 --> 00:17:35,097
maybe you can take your friend
out for a nice thank-you dinner.

427
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:37,633
Sure.

428
00:17:37,635 --> 00:17:39,435
And you probably have
to invite your other friend

429
00:17:39,438 --> 00:17:40,837
'cause she overheard you
talking about it,

430
00:17:40,839 --> 00:17:42,905
and it would be awkward
to exclude her.

431
00:17:42,908 --> 00:17:44,842
Okay.

432
00:17:44,844 --> 00:17:45,942
How about now?

433
00:17:45,944 --> 00:17:48,211
All right.

434
00:17:50,382 --> 00:17:51,914
Don't forget your wallet.

435
00:17:51,917 --> 00:17:54,084
I...

436
00:18:04,807 --> 00:18:07,342
Greetings from planet Earth.

437
00:18:08,912 --> 00:18:11,046
Just turn left
at Alpha Centauri.

438
00:18:11,047 --> 00:18:13,081
You can't miss it.
