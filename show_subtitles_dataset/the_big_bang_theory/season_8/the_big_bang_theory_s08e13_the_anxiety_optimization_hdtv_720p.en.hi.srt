1
00:00:05,287 --> 00:00:07,454
Okay, we're headed out—
See you later.

2
00:00:07,456 --> 00:00:08,621
Before you leave,

3
00:00:08,623 --> 00:00:10,990
could you test these
noise-cancelling headphones?

4
00:00:10,992 --> 00:00:11,992
Yeah, sure.

5
00:00:11,993 --> 00:00:13,159
Okay.

6
00:00:14,963 --> 00:00:15,963
Go ahead.

7
00:00:15,964 --> 00:00:18,965
Hello, can you
hear me?

8
00:00:21,837 --> 00:00:23,503
Sheldon, I haven't changed
the filter

9
00:00:23,505 --> 00:00:25,605
in the water pitcher
in two years.

10
00:00:28,210 --> 00:00:32,312
Uh, Bernadette's nickname for
you is the virgin piña colada.

11
00:00:35,183 --> 00:00:39,452
Your George Lucas autograph
is really a “me” autograph.

12
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:44,591
Yeah, well, once I was too lazy
to walk across the hall,

13
00:00:44,593 --> 00:00:46,326
so I used your toothbrush.

14
00:00:48,430 --> 00:00:50,530
Ooh, and one time
when you were asleep,

15
00:00:50,532 --> 00:00:52,198
Amy totally
took off her...

16
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:54,400
And that's why
you're the best roommate ever.

17
00:00:55,637 --> 00:00:57,971
Aw...

18
00:00:57,973 --> 00:00:59,472
Now I'm sad I didn't hear it.

19
00:00:59,474 --> 00:01:01,941
So what do you need
the headphones for?

20
00:01:01,943 --> 00:01:03,510
Well, I've been
struggling for months

21
00:01:03,512 --> 00:01:05,745
to come up with
a theory of dark matter

22
00:01:05,747 --> 00:01:07,413
that doesn't
make protons decay.

23
00:01:07,415 --> 00:01:09,115
I'm hoping to
finally tackle it

24
00:01:09,117 --> 00:01:11,117
by optimizing my
work environment.

25
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:15,755
See, I've got, uh, my tea is at
the perfect sipping temperature.

26
00:01:15,757 --> 00:01:18,291
Uh, I have fleece-lined
boxer shorts

27
00:01:18,293 --> 00:01:19,659
to keep my tushie toasty.

28
00:01:19,661 --> 00:01:21,160
And then, oh,
last but not least,

29
00:01:21,162 --> 00:01:24,097
this inspirational cat poster,

30
00:01:24,099 --> 00:01:26,132
improved with
the reassuring face

31
00:01:26,134 --> 00:01:28,368
of physics renegade
Richard Feynman.

32
00:01:31,473 --> 00:01:34,474
Is that why you had to take him
to Office Depot last night?

33
00:01:34,476 --> 00:01:36,676
I don't want to talk about it.

34
00:01:37,512 --> 00:01:38,912
There, the place is all yours.

35
00:01:38,914 --> 00:01:39,879
Yeah, have fun.

36
00:01:39,881 --> 00:01:41,848
Oh, I will—
nothing more fun

37
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:43,416
than a paradigm-shifting
evening of science.

38
00:01:44,553 --> 00:01:46,853
And you thought it was
soaping me up in the shower.

39
00:01:47,856 --> 00:01:48,821
Bye.

40
00:01:48,823 --> 00:01:51,424
Okay.

41
00:01:51,426 --> 00:01:53,626
Here we go.

42
00:01:55,397 --> 00:01:57,263
Proton decay.

43
00:01:58,733 --> 00:02:00,600
Proton decay.

44
00:02:01,403 --> 00:02:03,269
Proton decay.

45
00:02:04,239 --> 00:02:06,105
Proton decay.

46
00:02:07,242 --> 00:02:09,676
Proton decay.

47
00:02:10,512 --> 00:02:11,844
Proton decay.

48
00:02:11,846 --> 00:02:13,112
Hey, we're home.

49
00:02:15,684 --> 00:02:17,584
Any progress?

50
00:02:17,586 --> 00:02:18,685
How could there be?

51
00:02:18,687 --> 00:02:20,553
With these constant
interruptions.

52
00:02:22,457 --> 00:02:26,225
I love him, but if he's broken,

@elder_man

63
00:02:58,461 --> 00:02:59,760
What are you doing?

64
00:02:59,762 --> 00:03:00,995
It's time to go.

65
00:03:00,997 --> 00:03:03,197
I'm not going to work today.

66
00:03:03,199 --> 00:03:05,132
And would you like
to know why?

67
00:03:05,134 --> 00:03:08,169
Ah, you're upset because you
spent the whole night working

68
00:03:08,171 --> 00:03:10,204
on dark matter
and didn't make a breakthrough,

69
00:03:10,206 --> 00:03:12,139
and now you're worried you made
a huge mistake switching fields,

70
00:03:12,141 --> 00:03:14,108
and you're gonna sit around
and sulk all day?

71
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:17,144
Like a big old baby.

72
00:03:18,615 --> 00:03:20,047
Call me
if you need anything.

73
00:03:23,486 --> 00:03:26,888
I've been cooped up
in here too long.

74
00:03:26,890 --> 00:03:29,891
Maybe I need some fresh air.

75
00:03:48,077 --> 00:03:49,110
Penny?

76
00:03:50,413 --> 00:03:51,445
Penny?

77
00:03:52,382 --> 00:03:54,415
Penny?

78
00:03:55,718 --> 00:03:57,752
Ugh, what?

79
00:03:57,754 --> 00:03:59,620
You sounded in distress.

80
00:03:59,622 --> 00:04:01,322
I was worried something
unpleasant was happening to you.

81
00:04:01,324 --> 00:04:02,857
Like a murder.

82
00:04:02,859 --> 00:04:05,826
Or spontaneous coitus
with Leonard.

83
00:04:07,597 --> 00:04:09,163
Oh, I'm just doing
this awful workout.

84
00:04:09,165 --> 00:04:10,364
I hate it.

85
00:04:10,366 --> 00:04:12,767
Well, if you hate it,
then why are you doing it?

86
00:04:12,769 --> 00:04:14,568
Although I could ask
the same question

87
00:04:14,570 --> 00:04:16,337
about coitus with Leonard.

88
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:19,106
I don't know— I guess
I like that I hate it.

89
00:04:19,108 --> 00:04:20,741
It makes me work harder.

90
00:04:20,743 --> 00:04:22,576
And to clarify...

91
00:04:22,578 --> 00:04:24,445
The exercise, Sheldon.

92
00:04:25,748 --> 00:04:27,682
Shouldn't you be getting
ready for work?

93
00:04:27,684 --> 00:04:29,183
I'm not going.

94
00:04:29,185 --> 00:04:30,584
Would you like to know why?

95
00:04:30,586 --> 00:04:33,220
Uh, you're sad about not getting
anything done last night,

96
00:04:33,222 --> 00:04:35,556
so you're gonna sit around
and pout about it?

97
00:04:36,659 --> 00:04:39,360
Boy, I'm not nearly as
mysterious as I think I am.

98
00:04:41,497 --> 00:04:42,663
I invented a game.

99
00:04:42,665 --> 00:04:44,365
You want to play?
Sure.

100
00:04:44,367 --> 00:04:46,767
It's called
“Emily or Cinnamon"

101
00:04:46,769 --> 00:04:50,104
I give you actual quotes
I've heard Raj say,

102
00:04:50,106 --> 00:04:54,342
and you guess if he was talking
to his girlfriend or his dog.

103
00:04:58,281 --> 00:04:59,947
Go ahead, make fun.

104
00:04:59,949 --> 00:05:00,982
You can't embarrass.

105
00:05:00,984 --> 00:05:02,416
I've got a beautiful
girlfriend

106
00:05:02,418 --> 00:05:05,319
and a dog who loves me so much
she drinks my bathwater.

107
00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:10,825
Okay, who was he talking to,
Emily or Cinnamon:

108
00:05:10,827 --> 00:05:13,561
“I want you to know,
the bed feels so lonely

109
00:05:13,563 --> 00:05:15,262
when you're not in it.”

110
00:05:21,704 --> 00:05:23,971
I may not be liking
this game so much.

111
00:05:25,441 --> 00:05:27,008
Cinnamon.
Give me another one.

112
00:05:27,877 --> 00:05:29,377
Okay, Emily or Cinnamon:

113
00:05:29,379 --> 00:05:31,412
“Check it out,
I got us matching sweaters!”

114
00:05:31,414 --> 00:05:33,948
We all got the Christmas card—
Cinnamon.

115
00:05:35,418 --> 00:05:38,786
You know, a man can care deeply
about a woman and a pet.

116
00:05:38,788 --> 00:05:39,820
It's not strange.

117
00:05:39,822 --> 00:05:40,788
Ooh, Emily.

118
00:05:40,790 --> 00:05:42,990
I heard him say that
to Emily.

119
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,027
Hey, I thought
you were staying home.

120
00:05:46,029 --> 00:05:48,429
Yeah, I was, but after
talking to Penny,

121
00:05:48,431 --> 00:05:50,031
I realized something.

122
00:05:50,033 --> 00:05:53,401
I... first, she's trying much
harder to stay attractive

123
00:05:53,403 --> 00:05:55,703
in this relationship
than you are.

124
00:05:59,876 --> 00:06:01,342
E'
And second...

125
00:06:01,344 --> 00:06:04,278
the reason I may not be
progressing in my research is

126
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:07,948
I've created too pleasant
of an environment for myself.

127
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:09,283
What do you me?

128
00:06:09,285 --> 00:06:11,786
According to a classic
psychological experiment

129
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:15,122
by Yerkes and Dodson, in order
to maximize performance,

130
00:06:15,124 --> 00:06:18,259
one must create a state
of productive anxiety.

131
00:06:18,261 --> 00:06:21,962
So I'd like to ask you all
to do something for me.

132
00:06:21,964 --> 00:06:23,798
Keep me on my toes.

133
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,966
Just throw me off my game.

134
00:06:25,968 --> 00:06:30,071
E-Essentially, go out of your
way to make my life miserable.

135
00:06:32,575 --> 00:06:34,208
Hold on.

136
00:06:34,210 --> 00:06:35,776
What's in it for us?

137
00:06:35,778 --> 00:06:37,878
Well, I suppose...
Okay, we'll do it!

138
00:06:46,689 --> 00:06:47,988
Done.

139
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:49,623
33 seconds.

140
00:06:49,625 --> 00:06:51,525
Okay, that'll be
our baseline.

141
00:06:51,527 --> 00:06:53,227
You know, I don't
want to tell you

142
00:06:53,229 --> 00:06:55,729
how to do your job, but when
a mouse completes a maze,

143
00:06:55,731 --> 00:06:57,665
it gets a food pellet.

144
00:06:57,667 --> 00:07:01,368
It also gets its brain
plucked out with tweezers.

145
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:04,405
And his last meal was
a food pellet?

146
00:07:04,407 --> 00:07:05,906
You're a monster.

147
00:07:08,044 --> 00:07:10,010
All right, next,
we're gonna introduce

148
00:07:10,012 --> 00:07:12,513
an anxiety-inducing stimulus,
measure your stress levels

149
00:07:12,515 --> 00:07:14,248
and see how it affects
your problem-solving rate.

150
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:15,282
Very well.

151
00:07:15,284 --> 00:07:18,018
And good luck—
I'm a pretty laid-back guy.

152
00:07:19,722 --> 00:07:21,055
Ready?

153
00:07:21,057 --> 00:07:22,590
Begin.

154
00:07:44,981 --> 00:07:46,614
Why'd you pop it?

155
00:07:46,616 --> 00:07:48,883
I'm sorry, I was aiming
for your heart.

156
00:07:52,021 --> 00:07:53,521
Look, I know you
don't like it'

157
00:07:53,523 --> 00:07:55,055
but that's the point
of the experiment.

158
00:07:55,057 --> 00:07:56,624
I need to irritate you

159
00:07:56,626 --> 00:07:58,926
to find your optimal
anxiety zone.

160
00:07:58,928 --> 00:08:01,428
And you said no to
tickling, polka music

161
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:03,631
or watching me
eat a banana.

162
00:08:03,633 --> 00:08:06,433
Who eats them
horizontally?

163
00:08:07,637 --> 00:08:09,904
My mother said that's
how good girls do it.

164
00:08:14,076 --> 00:08:16,277
Perhaps this was
a waste of time.

165
00:08:16,279 --> 00:08:17,912
Sheldon,

166
00:08:17,914 --> 00:08:19,847
you're a remarkable scientist.

167
00:08:19,849 --> 00:08:22,283
Just be patient— I'm sure
you'll find the breakthrough

168
00:08:22,285 --> 00:08:23,617
you've been looking for.

169
00:08:23,619 --> 00:08:25,119
Thank you.

170
00:08:25,121 --> 00:08:26,754
And if you only
do solid research

171
00:08:26,756 --> 00:08:29,823
instead of making
a groundbreaking discovery,

172
00:08:29,825 --> 00:08:31,325
what does it matter?

173
00:08:31,327 --> 00:08:33,694
“Only do solid research”?

174
00:08:33,696 --> 00:08:36,664
Uh... I come to you for help,
and you insult me?

175
00:08:36,666 --> 00:08:38,732
I thought the least that
you would do would be...

176
00:08:38,734 --> 00:08:40,734
Look, your anxiety levels
are right in the zone.

177
00:08:40,736 --> 00:08:42,069
Really?

178
00:08:42,071 --> 00:08:43,704
Oh, that's fantastic.

179
00:08:43,706 --> 00:08:44,972
N-Now, wait,
they're dropping.

180
00:08:44,974 --> 00:08:46,106
Why are they dropping?

181
00:08:46,108 --> 00:08:48,075
Because you're happy
they're elevated.

182
00:08:48,077 --> 00:08:49,877
Oh, that is infuriating!

183
00:08:49,879 --> 00:08:51,412
Ooh, look, they went
back up again.

184
00:08:51,414 --> 00:08:52,379
Terrific.

185
00:08:52,381 --> 00:08:54,181
Oh, no, they went
back down!

186
00:08:56,352 --> 00:09:00,354
All right, guys, what game
do you want to play?

187
00:09:00,356 --> 00:09:01,589
E'
Let's see.

188
00:09:01,591 --> 00:09:05,326
How about
“Emily or Cinnamon"

189
00:09:06,395 --> 00:09:08,262
You know what? I think
it's a little weird

190
00:09:08,264 --> 00:09:10,097
that you remember me
saying all these things.E'

191
00:09:10,099 --> 00:09:13,601
Maybe the truth is— you're
jealous of all my relationships.

192
00:09:14,403 --> 00:09:16,437
Oh, maybe I am.

193
00:09:16,439 --> 00:09:18,138
Who wouldn't want
to be the girl,

194
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:21,141
or possibly dog,
to hear the words:

195
00:09:21,143 --> 00:09:23,110
“You're so lucky.

196
00:09:23,112 --> 00:09:25,212
You have the
shiniest hair”.

197
00:09:28,718 --> 00:09:30,684
That is a tough one.

198
00:09:30,686 --> 00:09:32,920
Uh, I-I know he brushes
both of them.

199
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:37,157
Gentlemen...
Yeah.

200
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:40,327
I have figured out the perfect
way for you to irritate me.

201
00:09:40,329 --> 00:09:44,198
I'd like you to be my
intellectual sparring partners.

202
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:46,600
From now on,
when I make an assertion,

203
00:09:46,602 --> 00:09:48,035
I need you to challenge it.

204
00:09:48,037 --> 00:09:51,505
So you just want us to disagree
with whatever you say?

205
00:09:51,507 --> 00:09:52,673
Yes.

206
00:09:52,675 --> 00:09:55,542
And you think that's going to help?
Yes.

207
00:09:55,544 --> 00:09:58,145
Well, I don't think
that's gonna help at all.

208
00:09:58,147 --> 00:09:59,580
Oh, no, it will.

209
00:09:59,582 --> 00:10:03,083
See, by keeping my mind engaged,
I'll become more focused.

210
00:10:03,085 --> 00:10:05,486
Howard's right—
that'll never work.

211
00:10:05,488 --> 00:10:07,121
Stop fighting me on the premise.

212
00:10:07,123 --> 00:10:08,722
It's scientifically valid.

213
00:10:08,724 --> 00:10:10,324
I'm going to advance
propositions,

214
00:10:10,326 --> 00:10:11,892
I just want you to challenge me.

215
00:10:11,894 --> 00:10:14,762
I don't think that's
what you want at all.

216
00:10:15,831 --> 00:10:17,464
Why, of course it's what I want.

217
00:10:17,466 --> 00:10:20,000
Why would I say it's what I want
if it's not what I want?

218
00:10:20,002 --> 00:10:23,237
Because it is what you want,
and it's not what you said.

219
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:27,741
I ask you for one simple thing,
and you can't even do it.

220
00:10:27,743 --> 00:10:29,310
Yes, we can.
Yeah, well, then do it.

221
00:10:29,312 --> 00:10:30,944
Nah.

222
00:10:31,814 --> 00:10:33,747
You guys are the worst.

223
00:10:35,985 --> 00:10:38,786
Thank you,
I think that was helpful.

224
00:10:47,514 --> 00:10:50,382
So, whichever rep has
the best sales for the quarter

225
00:10:50,384 --> 00:10:51,950
gets a trip for two to Hawaii.

226
00:10:51,952 --> 00:10:54,519
That would be so romantic
for you and Leonard.

227
00:10:54,521 --> 00:10:56,888
Yeah, clearly you haven't
seen him on the beach

228
00:10:56,890 --> 00:10:58,790
walking around
with his metal detector.

229
00:11:00,127 --> 00:11:01,426
If I were going to Hawaii,

230
00:11:01,428 --> 00:11:04,095
I'd spend all my time
at the Keck Observatory.

231
00:11:04,097 --> 00:11:05,764
Did you know that
the telescopes there have

232
00:11:05,766 --> 00:11:07,299
better resolution
than the Hubble?

233
00:11:07,301 --> 00:11:08,733
Really?

234
00:11:08,735 --> 00:11:10,802
Want to go to Hawaii?

235
00:11:11,772 --> 00:11:12,771
Ladies?

236
00:11:12,773 --> 00:11:14,506
Ladies...

237
00:11:14,508 --> 00:11:16,241
Ladies?

238
00:11:16,243 --> 00:11:17,776
Come in.

239
00:11:18,645 --> 00:11:20,145
Ladies.

240
00:11:20,147 --> 00:11:21,646
What's up?

241
00:11:21,648 --> 00:11:23,982
As you may know,
I've been experimenting

242
00:11:23,984 --> 00:11:25,717
with elevated anxiety levels,

243
00:11:25,719 --> 00:11:26,952
and I thought,

244
00:11:26,954 --> 00:11:28,920
what better way
to increase my discomfort

245
00:11:28,922 --> 00:11:30,622
than to subject myself
to an evening

246
00:11:30,624 --> 00:11:33,191
of tasteless
uncensored crotch talk?

247
00:11:35,829 --> 00:11:38,830
What exactly do you think
goes on here?

248
00:11:38,832 --> 00:11:40,432
Well...

249
00:11:40,434 --> 00:11:42,133
conversations that you wouldn't
be comfortable having

250
00:11:42,135 --> 00:11:43,768
in front of the opposite sex.

251
00:11:43,770 --> 00:11:45,570
You know, who has
the best cervix.

252
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:49,808
Which sanitary napkin
is all the rage right now.

253
00:11:49,810 --> 00:11:53,345
Men's buttocks, and how you want
to pat and squeeze them.

254
00:11:54,982 --> 00:11:57,415
We were talking
about Penny's job.

255
00:11:57,417 --> 00:11:59,351
And how difficult it is to do

256
00:11:59,353 --> 00:12:01,419
when she's bloated,
cranky and crampy?

257
00:12:01,421 --> 00:12:03,521
Continue.

258
00:12:05,359 --> 00:12:07,292
Sheldon, we are just people.

259
00:12:07,294 --> 00:12:09,494
We talk about the same things
you guys talk about.

260
00:12:09,496 --> 00:12:12,263
You talk about
if werewolves can swim?

261
00:12:12,265 --> 00:12:13,932
See, Leonard says yes,

262
00:12:13,934 --> 00:12:16,635
but I say it depends on
if the human could swim

263
00:12:16,637 --> 00:12:17,602
before he was bitten.

264
00:12:17,604 --> 00:12:19,270
What do you think?

265
00:12:20,273 --> 00:12:23,141
Let's just talk
about our periods.

266
00:12:23,143 --> 00:12:24,743
No, hold on.

267
00:12:24,745 --> 00:12:27,746
All canines instinctively know
how to swim.

268
00:12:27,748 --> 00:12:30,448
Why wouldn't a werewolf have
the same abilities?

269
00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:33,118
Well, they're not
a hundred percent wolf.

270
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:35,887
They're a werewolf—
that's only part wolf.

271
00:12:35,889 --> 00:12:37,989
It's like comparing
apples to oranges.

272
00:12:37,991 --> 00:12:39,791
Thank you.

273
00:12:39,793 --> 00:12:42,494
Oh, and technically, it's apples
that turn into were-oranges

274
00:12:42,496 --> 00:12:44,195
when the moon is full.

275
00:12:45,298 --> 00:12:47,532
Hey, this is fun.

276
00:12:47,534 --> 00:12:49,634
We should do it sometime
when you aren't all PMS'ing.

277
00:12:49,636 --> 00:12:51,202
Bye.

278
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,246
What is going on?

279
00:13:01,248 --> 00:13:02,514
Oh.

280
00:13:02,516 --> 00:13:05,183
Uh, I need to keep my anxiety
at the right level,

281
00:13:05,185 --> 00:13:08,953
so I'm using Darth Vader,
the Joker, and Godzilla's roar

282
00:13:08,955 --> 00:13:10,722
to keep me in that sweet spot.

283
00:13:12,793 --> 00:13:15,160
Uh, I tried including
Taylor Swift in the mix,

284
00:13:15,162 --> 00:13:17,362
but turns out I love her.

285
00:13:19,666 --> 00:13:22,367
Well, at least listen to it
through headphones.

286
00:13:22,369 --> 00:13:24,369
I'm trying to sleep.
Good night.

287
00:13:25,205 --> 00:13:26,905
Boy!

288
00:13:28,175 --> 00:13:31,409
Taylor was right— haters gonna
hate, hate, hate, hate, hate.

289
00:13:34,614 --> 00:13:37,248
You've been working
so much lately,

290
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:39,317
I'm glad you didn't forget
about date night.

291
00:13:39,319 --> 00:13:40,852
Of course.

292
00:13:43,123 --> 00:13:44,123
Sheldon.

293
00:13:44,124 --> 00:13:45,690
Yeah.

294
00:13:45,692 --> 00:13:48,593
Maybe you want to put the
notebook away and talk to me.

295
00:13:48,595 --> 00:13:50,628
I can do both.

296
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:53,298
No, my brain is working
at optimal capacity.

297
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:55,333
No, I can have
a conversation with you

298
00:13:55,335 --> 00:13:59,471
and solve the dark matter proton
decay problem at the same time.

299
00:14:00,574 --> 00:14:01,940
Fine.
How was your day?

300
00:14:01,942 --> 00:14:03,441
Oh, you said it.

301
00:14:05,979 --> 00:14:07,278
Sheldon.

302
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:08,947
Sheldon, I'm
worried about you.

303
00:14:08,949 --> 00:14:10,682
You're not eating,

304
00:14:10,684 --> 00:14:12,684
you haven't
slept in days,

305
00:14:12,686 --> 00:14:15,453
and, to be honest, that
cap is starting to smell.

306
00:14:16,656 --> 00:14:18,256
I know.

307
00:14:18,258 --> 00:14:20,959
It's replaced Godzilla as
my principle source of anxiety.

308
00:14:26,333 --> 00:14:28,633
Okay, so it's one vote Emily,
one vote Cinnamon.

309
00:14:28,635 --> 00:14:30,735
Penny, you're
the tiebreaker.

310
00:14:33,707 --> 00:14:35,173
Say the quote again.

311
00:14:35,175 --> 00:14:39,477
“It's just so perfect
that we're both Libras.”

312
00:14:44,618 --> 00:14:46,918
Wow, this is hard.

313
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:47,952
I'm gonna say
Cinnamon.

314
00:14:47,954 --> 00:14:50,054
Yes! Yes!
Come on!

315
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:53,091
That was the last one,
I promise.

316
00:14:53,093 --> 00:14:54,325
We won't play anymore.

317
00:14:54,327 --> 00:14:55,760
Thank you.

318
00:14:55,762 --> 00:14:57,996
'Cause if she ever found out,
it would hurt her feelings.

319
00:14:57,998 --> 00:15:00,832
Emily's feelings?

320
00:15:00,834 --> 00:15:02,700
Yes, Emily.

321
00:15:02,702 --> 00:15:04,669
Nice! - Yay!
Good job!

322
00:15:06,406 --> 00:15:08,106
Whatever.
Where's Sheldon?

323
00:15:08,108 --> 00:15:09,340
Date night.

324
00:15:09,342 --> 00:15:11,042
Mmm, that can't be
much fun for Amy.

325
00:15:11,044 --> 00:15:13,545
You know, at work today,
he tried his first Red Bull.

326
00:15:13,547 --> 00:15:14,579
What happened?

327
00:15:14,581 --> 00:15:15,914
He chased a squirrel

328
00:15:15,916 --> 00:15:17,916
around the quad
for a while and...

329
00:15:18,885 --> 00:15:21,052
then threw up in my car.

330
00:15:22,789 --> 00:15:25,190
Don't you think you should
make him stop all this?

331
00:15:25,192 --> 00:15:27,625
I don't know— he's not
really hurting anybody.

332
00:15:27,627 --> 00:15:31,696
You didn't have to scoop vomit
out of your glove compartment.

333
00:15:31,698 --> 00:15:33,464
He is getting
a lot of work done.

334
00:15:33,466 --> 00:15:36,201
He had a pretty interesting
take on proton decay.

335
00:15:36,203 --> 00:15:39,871
Wow, if he cracks that,
it's a game changer, guys.

336
00:15:39,873 --> 00:15:41,906
It'll completely redefine
our understanding

337
00:15:41,908 --> 00:15:43,575
of the physical universe.

338
00:15:44,744 --> 00:15:47,312
Hmm, it would.

339
00:15:47,314 --> 00:15:49,881
Okay, back to
“Emily or Cinnamon"

340
00:15:51,151 --> 00:15:55,820
“How can such a little girl
eat such a big steak"

341
00:16:00,393 --> 00:16:01,526
Sheldon,

342
00:16:01,528 --> 00:16:03,361
I want you to take
that cap off.

343
00:16:03,363 --> 00:16:07,398
That nagging tone is
helping my anxiety, yeah.

344
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:09,734
But if you could maybe just go
ten percent less shrill,

345
00:16:09,736 --> 00:16:12,370
that'd really put the zip-a-Dee
in my doo-dah.

346
00:16:12,372 --> 00:16:14,906
I'm sorry, but
you know we agreed

347
00:16:14,908 --> 00:16:16,641
not to bring work
to date night.

348
00:16:16,643 --> 00:16:19,077
There you go, perfect.

349
00:16:19,079 --> 00:16:21,045
Sheldon, stop it,
I'm not kidding.

350
00:16:21,047 --> 00:16:23,882
Take the cap off, and
put the notebook away.

351
00:16:23,884 --> 00:16:27,585
But after months of struggling,
I'm finally making progress.

352
00:16:27,587 --> 00:16:30,488
You don't need to drive yourself
crazy in order to be productive.

353
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:32,423
Or do I, hmm?

354
00:16:32,425 --> 00:16:34,792
Sir Isaac Newton wrote
his Principia

355
00:16:34,794 --> 00:16:37,428
while convinced he was
an armadillo.

356
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:38,796
That's not true.

357
00:16:38,798 --> 00:16:40,465
Yeah, well, maybe it is,
maybe it isn't.

358
00:16:40,467 --> 00:16:42,333
I have been
hallucinating lately.

359
00:16:44,671 --> 00:16:46,271
Sheldon, this has to stop.

360
00:16:46,273 --> 00:16:48,806
You need to get some sleep
and take care of yourself.

361
00:16:48,808 --> 00:16:51,643
Amy, I have gotten more done
in the last few days

362
00:16:51,645 --> 00:16:53,978
than I have since I made
the switch to dark matter.

363
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:57,348
What if I stop doing this,
and it all goes away?

364
00:16:57,350 --> 00:17:01,085
Your thoughts and ideas come
from you, not from your anxiety.

365
00:17:01,087 --> 00:17:02,353
Hmm, perhaps.

366
00:17:02,355 --> 00:17:04,022
But I'm not taking
the cap off.

367
00:17:04,958 --> 00:17:06,958
It's one thing to make
yourself miserable,

368
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:09,327
but you're making everyone
around you miserable, too.

369
00:17:09,329 --> 00:17:13,031
Now, I'm telling you for the
last time— take the cap off.

370
00:17:13,033 --> 00:17:14,666
Oh!

371
00:17:14,668 --> 00:17:16,000
Really?

372
00:17:16,002 --> 00:17:17,635
What if I don't?

373
00:17:17,637 --> 00:17:21,005
And before you answer that,
can I have my dessert?

374
00:17:22,442 --> 00:17:24,676
And then she
threw me out.

375
00:17:27,447 --> 00:17:29,714
Me, her very
own boyfriend.

376
00:17:29,716 --> 00:17:32,417
When all I've done is try
to help humanity reach

377
00:17:32,419 --> 00:17:35,620
a more profound understanding
of the world we live in.

378
00:17:38,792 --> 00:17:40,124
Yeah, well, women—

379
00:17:40,126 --> 00:17:41,993
what are you gonna do?

380
00:17:44,731 --> 00:17:47,265
I knew you'd understand,
Armadillo Isaac Newton.

381
00:17:51,705 --> 00:17:54,372
Okay...

382
00:17:54,374 --> 00:17:56,708
Here we are.

383
00:17:56,710 --> 00:17:58,676
Hey.

384
00:17:58,678 --> 00:18:00,511
What are you trying to pull?

385
00:18:00,513 --> 00:18:03,848
The president of
science isn't in here.

386
00:18:03,850 --> 00:18:06,751
You lie down, he'll be here
in a minute.

387
00:18:08,254 --> 00:18:09,687
Okay.

388
00:18:09,689 --> 00:18:11,856
Hey, I thought you were
trying to trick me.

389
00:18:14,928 --> 00:18:16,594
Now, you just
get comfortable.

390
00:18:16,596 --> 00:18:19,263
No, no, comfort is the enemy.

391
00:18:19,265 --> 00:18:20,565
You know what's comfortable?

392
00:18:20,567 --> 00:18:24,302
Slippers and blankets
and panda bears.

393
00:18:25,538 --> 00:18:29,707
Imagine a panda bear with
Richard Feynman's face on it.

394
00:18:31,044 --> 00:18:34,212
Warm up the car, Leonard,
it's poster time.

395
00:18:34,214 --> 00:18:35,847
Maybe in the morning.

396
00:18:35,849 --> 00:18:37,281
Yeah, you get
some sleep.

397
00:18:37,283 --> 00:18:39,751
No, I don't want to go
to sleep— you can't make me.

398
00:18:39,753 --> 00:18:41,219
You're right, we can't.

399
00:18:41,221 --> 00:18:42,487
Yeah, darn straight, you can't.

400
00:18:42,489 --> 00:18:44,022
Try to tell a grown man
to go to sleep...

You know, he can be
a lot of trouble,

409
00:19:06,513 --> 00:19:09,547
but when I see him lying
here asleep like this,

410
00:19:09,549 --> 00:19:12,183
I just think...

411
00:19:12,185 --> 00:19:15,420
how easy it would be to
hold a pillow over his face.

412
00:19:23,935 --> 00:19:26,469
Wow, you look like
you got some rest.

413
00:19:26,471 --> 00:19:28,438
Oh, I'm feeling
much better.

414
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:30,807
And I've also been
continuing to make progress

415
00:19:30,809 --> 00:19:33,643
without artificially
raising my anxiety levels.

416
00:19:33,645 --> 00:19:36,312
I turned on the heat in my car
and some vomit came out,

417
00:19:36,314 --> 00:19:37,681
so my levels—
right up there.

418
00:19:37,683 --> 00:19:39,649
Hey, guys.

419
00:19:39,651 --> 00:19:41,051
Mind if Emily
joins us for lunch?

420
00:19:41,053 --> 00:19:42,352
Yeah, sure. Yeah, no problem.
Of course not.

421
00:19:42,354 --> 00:19:45,288
So I hear you guys have been
playing a little game.

422
00:19:45,290 --> 00:19:48,525
Well, um, we were
just kidding around.

423
00:19:48,527 --> 00:19:51,227
Well, you may think it's funny
that Raj is sweet and sensitive,

424
00:19:51,229 --> 00:19:53,396
but I think it's sexy.

425
00:19:56,934 --> 00:19:59,269
Ugh, why is there dog hair
in your mouth?
