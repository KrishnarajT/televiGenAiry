00:00:03,655 --> 00:00:06,958
Hello. I'm Dr.
Sheldon Cooper.

2
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:11,829
And welcome to Sheldon Cooper
Presents: Fun with Flags,

3
00:00:11,831 --> 00:00:14,065
the Final Episode
Flagtacular.

4
00:00:15,868 --> 00:00:19,136
I knew it was coming.
Still scary.

5
00:00:19,138 --> 00:00:21,939
Now, I'm sure you're thinking,
"The final episode?

6
00:00:21,941 --> 00:00:25,343
Who will stand between
us and flag ignorance"

7
00:00:25,345 --> 00:00:27,645
I know I was thinking that.

8
00:00:27,647 --> 00:00:31,282
Is this a show on flags
or mind reading?

9
00:00:31,284 --> 00:00:35,086
But the truth is I can no longer
balance a full-time career,

10
00:00:35,088 --> 00:00:37,855
a popular Internet show,
and a girlfriend.

11
00:00:37,857 --> 00:00:42,693
And he really does have one,
you jerks on the comment board.

12
00:00:42,695 --> 00:00:49,500
So as they say, all good
things must come to an end.

13
00:00:49,502 --> 00:00:51,836
233 if we
include the one

14
00:00:51,838 --> 00:00:55,206
somebody forgot
to press record on.

15
00:00:55,208 --> 00:00:57,174
You said
you weren't gonna bring that up.

16
00:00:57,176 --> 00:00:58,856
And you
said you pressed record.

17
00:01:00,278 --> 00:01:03,247
Anyway, please
sit back, relax,

18
00:01:03,249 --> 00:01:06,517
and join us as we
take our final lap...

19
00:01:07,586 --> 00:01:10,521
as indicated by the
waving of this racing flag.

20
00:01:10,523 --> 00:01:13,357
And, of course, white flags
can also represent surrender,

21
00:01:13,359 --> 00:01:16,260
the Stewards of Gondor, and
the Japanese Minamoto clan,

22
00:01:16,262 --> 00:01:18,796
but I'm sure you remember that,
from episode sixty-two.

23
00:01:18,798 --> 00:01:23,167
"White Flags: Who's
Wavin' 'Em and Why?"

24
00:01:23,169 --> 00:01:24,702
That was a good one.

25
00:01:24,704 --> 00:01:26,003
It was so good.

@elder_man

36
00:01:56,549 --> 00:01:59,585
You know, I thought cleaning out
a dead professor's office

37
00:01:59,587 --> 00:02:00,919
was gonna just be boring,

38
00:02:00,921 --> 00:02:03,255
but then I found his dentures

39
00:02:03,257 --> 00:02:06,458
and realized it's also gross.

40
00:02:08,127 --> 00:02:11,263
Doesn't Professor Abbott's
family want any of this stuff?

41
00:02:11,265 --> 00:02:12,364
I don't think he had a family.

42
00:02:12,366 --> 00:02:13,932
That's rough.
I know.

43
00:02:13,934 --> 00:02:15,567
You can spend your whole life
working,

44
00:02:15,569 --> 00:02:18,804
and at the end all that's left
are some papers in a box.

45
00:02:18,806 --> 00:02:21,773
Makes you think.

46
00:02:21,775 --> 00:02:24,543
Oh, well.

47
00:02:24,545 --> 00:02:26,879
Hey. Hey, we're supposed to
look through all this stuff

48
00:02:26,881 --> 00:02:28,814
before we throw it away
in case it's important.

49
00:02:28,816 --> 00:02:31,750
I-I did.
It's all outdated or disproved.

50
00:02:31,752 --> 00:02:34,853
I don't know. This old pen
kind of proves gravity.

51
00:02:34,855 --> 00:02:38,123
When I tilt it, her bathing
suit falls right off.

52
00:02:38,125 --> 00:02:39,258
Oh,

53
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:41,260
my dad used to have
a pen like that.

54
00:02:41,262 --> 00:02:44,663
I dated it
all through sixth grade.

55
00:02:44,665 --> 00:02:45,697
It still feels weird

56
00:02:45,699 --> 00:02:48,000
just throwing away his work
like this.

57
00:02:48,002 --> 00:02:49,101
Don't feel bad.
Someday,

58
00:02:49,103 --> 00:02:51,870
someone will be throwing out
your work, too.

59
00:02:51,872 --> 00:02:56,408
That someone was Sheldon,
and the day was yesterday.

60
00:02:57,410 --> 00:02:59,678
Hey, look at this.

61
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,915
"Dear Roger, to be opened
upon your first great discovery.

62
00:03:02,917 --> 00:03:04,983
Love, Mom."

63
00:03:04,985 --> 00:03:06,785
Wow, look at the date.

64
00:03:06,787 --> 00:03:10,155
He saved this 50 years
and never got to open it.

65
00:03:10,157 --> 00:03:12,591
That's intense.

66
00:03:12,593 --> 00:03:15,527
Poor Roger Abbott.

67
00:03:15,529 --> 00:03:20,132
Roger Abbott sounds
just like Roger Rabbit.

68
00:03:20,134 --> 00:03:24,102
Roger Abbott, Roger Abbott,
Roger Abbott.

69
00:03:24,104 --> 00:03:27,706
Oh, my God, Leonard, I know
he's dead, but try it. It's fun!

70
00:03:28,608 --> 00:03:30,142
Roger Abbott,
Roger Abbott...

71
00:03:31,311 --> 00:03:33,645
Penny!

72
00:03:33,647 --> 00:03:36,348
Oh, my rookie of the year.

73
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:38,984
Oh, Dan. My boss who didn't want
to hire me

74
00:03:38,986 --> 00:03:41,219
and now's a little hug machine.
Oh,

75
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:42,821
look at you. Brand-new

76
00:03:42,823 --> 00:03:45,123
and already
the third best sales rep.

77
00:03:45,125 --> 00:03:46,892
Aw. Yes.
Why don't you come over to my table.

78
00:03:46,894 --> 00:03:48,894
I'll be right there.
Bernadette's just parking the car.

79
00:03:48,896 --> 00:03:51,897
Oh, good.

80
00:03:51,899 --> 00:03:54,566
Bernadette. Cute, sweet...

81
00:03:54,568 --> 00:03:56,501
vicious little Bernadette.

82
00:03:56,503 --> 00:03:58,704
Come on. She's not that bad.

83
00:03:58,706 --> 00:04:00,038
Oh, yeah?

84
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:02,274
At the company picnic
she yelled at me and my grandson

85
00:04:02,276 --> 00:04:04,443
for losing
the three-legged race.

86
00:04:04,445 --> 00:04:09,614
I mean, he still calls her "that
mean kid with the big boobies."

87
00:04:09,616 --> 00:04:12,084
I know she can be
a little intense, but, I swear,

88
00:04:12,086 --> 00:04:14,519
she is so sweet
once you get past all the...

89
00:04:14,521 --> 00:04:15,687
Hey, what are you
talking about?

90
00:04:15,689 --> 00:04:17,089
Oh. We were just talking

91
00:04:17,091 --> 00:04:19,257
about how much we love working
with you. Isn't that right?

92
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:21,460
Dan?

93
00:04:24,497 --> 00:04:26,832
Over the years here
at Fun With Flags,

94
00:04:26,834 --> 00:04:30,369
we've had an opportunity to
learn, laugh, wonder...

95
00:04:30,371 --> 00:04:34,239
And, yes, even shed
a tear or two.

96
00:04:34,241 --> 00:04:37,909
Like when you do a two-hour
Fourth of July spectacular

97
00:04:37,911 --> 00:04:40,879
and it doesn't
get recorded.

98
00:04:40,881 --> 00:04:43,915
How many times do I have
to say I'm sorry?

99
00:04:43,917 --> 00:04:46,885
How about 4,000.

100
00:04:46,887 --> 00:04:49,955
One for every domino I set up
to make that American flag.

101
00:04:51,057 --> 00:04:54,292
Please enjoy
these highlights.

102
00:04:55,695 --> 00:04:58,997
Crikey! What flag
do we have today?

103
00:05:02,435 --> 00:05:04,669
Australia, mate!

104
00:05:08,041 --> 00:05:12,411
And now it's time for the speed
round of Flag or Not a Flag.

105
00:05:12,413 --> 00:05:15,213
Flag.
Flag.

106
00:05:15,215 --> 00:05:17,249
Not a flag.
Flag.

107
00:05:17,251 --> 00:05:19,918
I am crushing this.

108
00:05:24,223 --> 00:05:28,026
Say, Betsy Ross,
what you working on?

109
00:05:28,028 --> 00:05:31,630
I have no idea.

110
00:05:31,632 --> 00:05:35,100
Because the story of me
sewing the first American flag

111
00:05:35,102 --> 00:05:38,136
is unsupported
poppycock.

112
00:05:38,138 --> 00:05:40,972
Then who did sew it, hmm?

113
00:05:40,974 --> 00:05:42,707
Don't ask me.

114
00:05:42,709 --> 00:05:46,144
I'm just a simple seamstress
whose descendants are...

115
00:05:46,146 --> 00:05:49,548
out to make a quick buck!

116
00:05:56,122 --> 00:05:57,889
Fancy a dip, my dear?

117
00:05:57,891 --> 00:05:59,524
I do.

118
00:06:01,528 --> 00:06:04,262
Wait, that purple
flag indicates

119
00:06:04,264 --> 00:06:06,932
that marine pests, such
as jellyfish, are present.

120
00:06:06,934 --> 00:06:10,268
Wow, that flag
is a lifesaver.

121
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:12,604
No.

122
00:06:12,606 --> 00:06:14,806
This is.

123
00:06:16,309 --> 00:06:18,477
Stop looking at my legs.

124
00:06:19,545 --> 00:06:21,880
Not a flag.
Flag.

125
00:06:21,882 --> 00:06:24,182
Flag.
Not a flag.

126
00:06:24,184 --> 00:06:25,884
Flag.

127
00:06:25,886 --> 00:06:28,720
Crap.

128
00:06:29,856 --> 00:06:31,356
When stuff
like this gets me down,

129
00:06:31,358 --> 00:06:32,691
you know what I like to do?

130
00:06:32,693 --> 00:06:35,727
Sing "Hakuna Matata"
like an eight-year-old girl?

131
00:06:35,729 --> 00:06:37,562
Wrong, smarty-pants.

132
00:06:37,564 --> 00:06:41,266
It's "Everything Is Awesome"
from The Lego Movie.

133
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:44,136
Look at these notebooks.

134
00:06:44,138 --> 00:06:46,171
They're full of pages and pages
of data.

135
00:06:46,173 --> 00:06:47,906
He clearly spent years on this.

136
00:06:47,908 --> 00:06:50,742
Mmm. Oh, it's just columns
of random numbers. Toss it.

137
00:06:50,744 --> 00:06:53,645
Well, but what if this was a
potential breakthrough for him?

138
00:06:53,647 --> 00:06:55,313
What if...
what if this is the thing

139
00:06:55,315 --> 00:06:57,983
that would've finally let him
open that bottle of champagne?

140
00:06:57,985 --> 00:07:00,318
Maybe he didn't know what
to pair champagne with.

141
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:04,189
Strawberries, caviar, oysters.
All good choices.

142
00:07:05,725 --> 00:07:06,925
Yeah, that look right there

143
00:07:06,927 --> 00:07:10,328
is why people eat before
they come to your parties.

144
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:12,364
This has to mean something.

145
00:07:12,366 --> 00:07:16,501
Well, there's no discernible
pattern that I can see,

146
00:07:16,503 --> 00:07:18,870
but it shouldn't be too hard
to run the numbers and check.

147
00:07:18,872 --> 00:07:21,506
Well, maybe we can get
some time on the supercomputer.

148
00:07:21,508 --> 00:07:23,408
Sure. We could try
multiple regressions

149
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:25,911
with varying physical and
experimental constants.

150
00:07:25,913 --> 00:07:28,513
Oh, we could run
a pattern-matching algorithm

151
00:07:28,515 --> 00:07:30,649
against well-known
unsolved physics problems.

152
00:07:30,651 --> 00:07:33,118
Ooh, it might be
a substitution cipher.

153
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,086
We could start
with basic cryptanalysis.

154
00:07:35,088 --> 00:07:38,790
Or we could talk to this guy
he used to share an office with.

155
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:43,195
Oh, let's do that.

156
00:07:43,197 --> 00:07:45,730
Because you don't know how
to do cryptanalysis, do you?

157
00:07:45,732 --> 00:07:48,233
I'm not even sure if
it's the right word.

158
00:07:55,474 --> 00:07:56,975
So,

159
00:07:56,977 --> 00:07:59,611
Dan, you have a grandson.
How old is he?

160
00:07:59,613 --> 00:08:01,012
- Seven.
- Oh, yeah.

161
00:08:01,014 --> 00:08:02,948
I remember him from the picnic.

162
00:08:04,016 --> 00:08:06,918
He was the one crying
like a wuss the whole time.

163
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:11,289
I heard he was being picked on
by a mean kid.

164
00:08:11,291 --> 00:08:12,691
Just builds character.

165
00:08:12,693 --> 00:08:14,693
Like my dad said,
"Nobody likes a crybaby

166
00:08:14,695 --> 00:08:17,162
except their mommies
and Democrats."

167
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:19,397
I need another drink.

168
00:08:21,367 --> 00:08:23,268
What's his problem?
Oh.

169
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:25,103
I don't know.
Maybe he didn't like the fact

170
00:08:25,105 --> 00:08:26,905
that you called his grandson
a wuss.

171
00:08:26,907 --> 00:08:30,108
Well, I didn't think you were
supposed to say "sissy" anymore.

172
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:33,645
Okay, look, I know
what a good person you are,

173
00:08:33,647 --> 00:08:37,082
but sometimes people think you
might come off a little harsh.

174
00:08:37,084 --> 00:08:38,149
What?

175
00:08:38,151 --> 00:08:40,752
I'm, like, the sweetest person
I know.

176
00:08:41,787 --> 00:08:45,857
Look at me. I should be
in a tree baking cookies.

177
00:08:45,859 --> 00:08:47,826
Yes, but once in a while,

178
00:08:47,828 --> 00:08:51,129
people think
you're a little mean.

179
00:08:51,131 --> 00:08:52,364
Oh, yeah?

180
00:08:52,366 --> 00:08:54,132
You one of those people?

181
00:08:54,967 --> 00:08:56,835
No. No, no, no.

182
00:08:56,837 --> 00:08:59,804
I-I think the cookie thing.

183
00:09:03,809 --> 00:09:05,343
Action.

184
00:09:05,345 --> 00:09:06,978
Welcome back.

185
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:09,714
Our guest today
is a returning fan favorite.

186
00:09:09,716 --> 00:09:12,083
He puts the reading
in your rainbow,

187
00:09:12,085 --> 00:09:13,618
the Geordi in your La Forge,

188
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:15,553
and the Kunta in your Kinte,

189
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:17,756
Mr. LeVar Burton.

190
00:09:22,028 --> 00:09:24,729
Thank you, Sheldon.
Now, remember our deal...

191
00:09:24,731 --> 00:09:29,167
You do this, I delete
your contact information.

192
00:09:29,169 --> 00:09:30,302
While...

193
00:09:30,304 --> 00:09:32,370
While you watch me do it.

194
00:09:32,372 --> 00:09:34,406
Great. Happy to be back.

195
00:09:34,408 --> 00:09:36,007
Well, since you're here,

196
00:09:36,009 --> 00:09:38,476
I'd like to get your
opinion on something.

197
00:09:38,478 --> 00:09:40,545
In honor of Black
History Month,

198
00:09:40,547 --> 00:09:42,580
I portrayed George
Washington Carver

199
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:47,185
in a loving tribute that my
roommate called "wildly racist"

200
00:09:47,187 --> 00:09:49,254
What do you think?

201
00:09:49,256 --> 00:09:51,489
Hi. My name is George.

202
00:09:51,491 --> 00:09:53,658
Oh, hell, no!

203
00:09:56,295 --> 00:09:58,196
You heard him, Leonard.

204
00:09:58,198 --> 00:10:00,365
No, it's not racist.

205
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:11,788
Are we sure this is the place?

206
00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:13,857
The doorman said this
is the right building.

207
00:10:13,859 --> 00:10:15,792
I think if you're pulling up
your pants,

208
00:10:15,794 --> 00:10:18,161
you're not a doorman.

209
00:10:18,163 --> 00:10:19,596
Who is it?

210
00:10:19,598 --> 00:10:21,731
Uh, I'm looking
for a Professor Sharpe?

211
00:10:21,733 --> 00:10:24,667
Hold on.

212
00:10:24,669 --> 00:10:26,236
Can I help you?
Hi.

213
00:10:26,238 --> 00:10:28,438
We're from the university. We're
trying to get some information

214
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:29,706
about Professor Abbott.

215
00:10:29,708 --> 00:10:31,141
We were cleaning
out his office

216
00:10:31,143 --> 00:10:32,876
and found these books
full of numbers.

217
00:10:32,878 --> 00:10:34,511
Any chance you
know what it is?

218
00:10:34,513 --> 00:10:36,312
Yes, he was always working on this.
Oh.

219
00:10:36,314 --> 00:10:37,714
I was thinking
it might be

220
00:10:37,716 --> 00:10:39,716
some sort of interstellar
coordinate system,

221
00:10:39,718 --> 00:10:41,551
maybe an updated version
of Hubble's law.

222
00:10:41,553 --> 00:10:42,952
I keep seeing the
number 90 repeating.

223
00:10:42,954 --> 00:10:44,954
That could be the angle
of perturbation

224
00:10:44,956 --> 00:10:46,923
of a distant galaxy.

225
00:10:46,925 --> 00:10:49,726
It's the number
of calories in a yogurt.

226
00:10:50,461 --> 00:10:51,828
That's his food diary.

227
00:10:51,830 --> 00:10:53,263
Really?

228
00:10:53,265 --> 00:10:55,131
Yeah, he wrote down
everything he ever ate.

229
00:10:55,133 --> 00:10:57,333
He was convinced that calorie
restriction was the key

230
00:10:57,335 --> 00:10:58,735
to living forever.

231
00:10:58,737 --> 00:11:00,403
Does it work?

232
00:11:00,405 --> 00:11:01,838
Seriously?

233
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:04,741
Well, he could have been hit
by a bus. You don't know.

234
00:11:06,243 --> 00:11:07,944
Sorry it's not more interesting.

235
00:11:07,946 --> 00:11:10,046
On the bright side,
you didn't have to listen

236
00:11:10,048 --> 00:11:12,782
to his stomach growl
for 35 years.

237
00:11:12,784 --> 00:11:15,051
So, was there anything
that Professor Abbott worked on

238
00:11:15,053 --> 00:11:18,021
during his life that came close
to an accomplishment?

239
00:11:18,023 --> 00:11:21,491
To be honest, his research
never amounted to anything.

240
00:11:21,493 --> 00:11:23,560
Oh.
You were his colleague.

241
00:11:23,562 --> 00:11:24,561
How did your research turn out?

242
00:11:24,563 --> 00:11:26,596
Great. Hey, this is
the apartment you get

243
00:11:26,598 --> 00:11:28,798
when you win a Nobel.

244
00:11:29,833 --> 00:11:31,868
Well, you could be very frugal.

245
00:11:31,870 --> 00:11:34,270
I'm getting a little tired
of everybody's sarcasm.

246
00:11:37,641 --> 00:11:39,776
I'm not a bully.

247
00:11:39,778 --> 00:11:41,878
I mean, maybe I come
off a little strong,

248
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:43,880
but that's only because my
dad raised me to be tough

249
00:11:43,882 --> 00:11:45,448
and not to take
crap from anybody.

250
00:11:45,450 --> 00:11:48,751
No. That's fine, but there's
a difference between being tough

251
00:11:48,753 --> 00:11:52,121
and telling your friend her new
pants look like a saggy diaper.

252
00:11:54,158 --> 00:11:56,292
I did say that, didn't I?

253
00:11:56,294 --> 00:11:57,594
Yeah, you did.

254
00:11:57,596 --> 00:12:00,530
I felt so self-conscious,
I had to return them.

255
00:12:00,532 --> 00:12:03,499
Where? To Babies R Us?

256
00:12:03,501 --> 00:12:06,169
You're doing it again!

257
00:12:06,171 --> 00:12:07,537
Okay, sorry.
Can we just go?

258
00:12:07,539 --> 00:12:09,005
I feel like
everybody hates me.

259
00:12:09,007 --> 00:12:11,007
Oh, come on,
they don't hate you, all right?

260
00:12:11,009 --> 00:12:12,141
They're just
a little intimidated.

261
00:12:12,143 --> 00:12:13,710
All you need to do
is show everyone

262
00:12:13,712 --> 00:12:14,877
how sweet you really are.

263
00:12:14,879 --> 00:12:16,879
I think I'd rather go.
No, come on.

264
00:12:16,881 --> 00:12:18,514
You are not going anywhere,
all right?

265
00:12:18,516 --> 00:12:20,850
I am here for you, and we are
gonna fix this together.

266
00:12:20,852 --> 00:12:22,252
Thank you.

267
00:12:22,254 --> 00:12:24,187
Even though your dress is ugly.

268
00:12:26,991 --> 00:12:29,392
Well, my little Flag-keteers,

269
00:12:29,394 --> 00:12:33,396
it looks like the last episode
of Fun with Flags is at an end.

270
00:12:33,398 --> 00:12:35,298
If I could,

271
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:39,402
I would run each and every one
of you viewers up a flagpole

272
00:12:39,404 --> 00:12:42,305
and salute you.

273
00:12:42,307 --> 00:12:44,807
And if you touched the ground,
burn you.

274
00:12:46,377 --> 00:12:47,810
I'd like to take a moment

275
00:12:47,812 --> 00:12:49,979
to personally thank
Dr. Amy Farrah Fowler,

276
00:12:49,981 --> 00:12:51,981
who you may
or may not know

277
00:12:51,983 --> 00:12:56,352
is the first woman to co-host
a flag or banner-related

278
00:12:56,354 --> 00:12:59,188
Internet info-tainment show.

279
00:12:59,190 --> 00:13:01,658
Take that, glass ceiling.

280
00:13:03,327 --> 00:13:07,330
And if I may get serious
for a moment,

281
00:13:07,332 --> 00:13:11,301
hosting this show has been...

282
00:13:11,303 --> 00:13:13,503
one crazy ride.

283
00:13:14,705 --> 00:13:17,240
With all its ups and downs,

284
00:13:17,242 --> 00:13:20,109
I wouldn't give it up
for the world.

285
00:13:21,512 --> 00:13:23,746
Except for now,
when I'm giving it up.

286
00:13:27,084 --> 00:13:29,352
Before I sign off, I'd, uh...

287
00:13:29,354 --> 00:13:33,756
I'd like to share with you all
one last use for a white flag.

288
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:37,760
It's good for times like this.

289
00:13:40,465 --> 00:13:42,598
Good night.

290
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:43,800
Cut.

291
00:13:45,636 --> 00:13:48,204
Sheldon...

292
00:13:48,206 --> 00:13:50,373
that was beautiful.

293
00:13:50,375 --> 00:13:51,541
If you didn't press record...

294
00:13:51,543 --> 00:13:53,710
I pressed it!

295
00:13:57,748 --> 00:14:00,850
Well, that's it.

296
00:14:00,852 --> 00:14:03,553
That's the end of Roger Abbott.

297
00:14:06,123 --> 00:14:08,424
And we still don't know
who framed him.

298
00:14:10,894 --> 00:14:12,562
I still keep thinking

299
00:14:12,564 --> 00:14:15,164
about how an entire life can
seemingly amount to nothing.

300
00:14:15,166 --> 00:14:17,900
I guess the
sad truth is,

301
00:14:17,902 --> 00:14:21,471
not everyone will
accomplish something great.

302
00:14:21,473 --> 00:14:22,972
Some of us

303
00:14:22,974 --> 00:14:24,941
may just have to find meaning

304
00:14:24,943 --> 00:14:28,544
in the little moments
that make up life.

305
00:14:28,546 --> 00:14:31,647
That's a nice way
of looking at it.

306
00:14:31,649 --> 00:14:33,616
Yeah for you, not for me.

307
00:14:33,618 --> 00:14:35,685
I went to space. I'm covered.

308
00:14:38,322 --> 00:14:39,956
You know what?

309
00:14:39,958 --> 00:14:43,159
This bottle was meant
to celebrate an achievement.

310
00:14:43,161 --> 00:14:44,527
Let's make a pact.

311
00:14:44,529 --> 00:14:46,829
When one of us gets their
first big breakthrough,

312
00:14:46,831 --> 00:14:49,465
we'll celebrate by opening
this bottle of champagne

313
00:14:49,467 --> 00:14:51,467
and toasting
Professor Abbott.

314
00:14:51,469 --> 00:14:52,668
I love that.

315
00:14:52,670 --> 00:14:53,736
Yeah, me, too.

316
00:14:53,738 --> 00:14:55,538
Then, of course,

317
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:57,306
rubbing our success
in Sheldon's face.

318
00:14:57,308 --> 00:14:59,642
Oh, well, that's the best part.
Oh, yeah.

319
00:15:00,744 --> 00:15:04,313
Dan, could I talk
to you for a minute?

320
00:15:07,518 --> 00:15:09,485
Sure, go ahead.

321
00:15:09,487 --> 00:15:11,254
Just want you to know
I didn't mean

322
00:15:11,256 --> 00:15:12,522
to be rude about your grandson.

323
00:15:12,524 --> 00:15:14,190
No, it's okay.

324
00:15:14,192 --> 00:15:16,058
No, it's not.

325
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:17,627
Penny told me
that everyone's scared of me.

326
00:15:17,629 --> 00:15:19,896
What? What?

327
00:15:19,898 --> 00:15:21,798
Why would she say that?

328
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:23,466
You know she drinks, right?

329
00:15:23,468 --> 00:15:25,401
What?

330
00:15:25,403 --> 00:15:27,804
No, she's right,
and I just want you to know

331
00:15:27,806 --> 00:15:30,206
that from now on, I'm gonna be
much more sensitive.

332
00:15:30,208 --> 00:15:32,241
I don't want anyone walking
on eggshells around me.

333
00:15:32,243 --> 00:15:34,777
Oh, well, okay, then, uh,

334
00:15:34,779 --> 00:15:36,712
one thing
I've been meaning to tell you

335
00:15:36,714 --> 00:15:39,515
is that the company is gonna
stop paying for our coffee.

336
00:15:39,517 --> 00:15:41,417
No problem. When
does that start?

337
00:15:41,419 --> 00:15:43,553
Five months ago.

338
00:15:43,555 --> 00:15:44,821
What?
Yeah.

339
00:15:44,823 --> 00:15:46,522
Who's been paying
for my coffee?

340
00:15:46,524 --> 00:15:47,524
All of us.

341
00:15:47,525 --> 00:15:49,225
Yeah. It comes
from the swear jar

342
00:15:49,227 --> 00:15:50,993
we put money in when you curse.

343
00:15:54,298 --> 00:15:55,932
What else don't I know about?

344
00:15:55,934 --> 00:15:58,768
Uh, well, you know
your private bathroom?

345
00:15:58,770 --> 00:15:59,425
Yeah?

346
00:15:59,449 --> 00:16:01,205
That was supposed to
be for the whole floor.

347
00:16:01,206 --> 00:16:03,339
- You're kidding.
- No, no.

348
00:16:03,341 --> 00:16:05,808
It's okay. It only really
affected Wheelchair Kathy,

349
00:16:05,810 --> 00:16:08,177
and she's back
in the hospital now,

350
00:16:08,179 --> 00:16:10,179
so it all worked out.

351
00:16:10,181 --> 00:16:13,382
I feel so bad.
Yeah.

352
00:16:13,384 --> 00:16:14,650
Well, then, maybe

353
00:16:14,652 --> 00:16:16,552
you shouldn't have named her
"Wheelchair Kathy."

354
00:16:17,921 --> 00:16:19,522
Oh, my God!

355
00:16:19,524 --> 00:16:22,992
I thought everybody liked me,
but I'm just a monster.

356
00:16:22,994 --> 00:16:26,863
But a cute one, like that, uh,
eyeball guy in Monsters, Inc.

357
00:16:26,865 --> 00:16:29,532
No, I'm the worst.

358
00:16:29,534 --> 00:16:31,200
I'm a terrible person.

359
00:16:31,202 --> 00:16:33,669
Come on, don't cry.
It's okay.

360
00:16:33,671 --> 00:16:34,904
It's not okay.

361
00:16:34,906 --> 00:16:37,573
How can I even work here anymore?
Oh.

362
00:16:37,575 --> 00:16:39,208
- Because this company needs you.
- It's fine.

363
00:16:39,210 --> 00:16:40,943
We don't mind paying
for the coffee.

364
00:16:40,945 --> 00:16:43,346
I can't let you do that.

365
00:16:43,348 --> 00:16:44,981
Maybe we could get you

366
00:16:44,983 --> 00:16:47,216
an espresso machine
for your office.

367
00:16:47,218 --> 00:16:49,252
I guess that would be all right.

368
00:16:49,254 --> 00:16:51,254
All right.

369
00:16:51,256 --> 00:16:53,656
See? You don't have

370
00:16:53,658 --> 00:16:55,224
to be mean
to get what you want.

371
00:16:55,226 --> 00:16:57,260
You're right.

372
00:16:57,262 --> 00:17:00,129
Now where did we land
on my bathroom?

373
00:17:04,769 --> 00:17:06,269
Hey.

374
00:17:06,271 --> 00:17:07,470
Hello.

375
00:17:07,472 --> 00:17:08,804
How come you're up so late?

376
00:17:08,806 --> 00:17:10,706
I posted the last episode

377
00:17:10,708 --> 00:17:12,742
of Fun with Flags hours ago,

378
00:17:12,744 --> 00:17:15,511
and not a single person
cared enough to comment.

379
00:17:17,347 --> 00:17:19,649
All that effort for nothing.

380
00:17:19,651 --> 00:17:21,617
Mm. I know how you feel.

381
00:17:21,619 --> 00:17:24,353
I spent the day throwing out
a man's entire career,

382
00:17:24,355 --> 00:17:26,188
and all that's left is
an old bottle of champagne

383
00:17:26,190 --> 00:17:28,558
and a naked lady pen
that Raj took

384
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:31,160
when he thought
no one was looking.

385
00:17:31,162 --> 00:17:33,996
It's not the same thing.

386
00:17:33,998 --> 00:17:36,666
I don't think you know
how I feel at all.

387
00:17:36,668 --> 00:17:39,135
Sad?

388
00:17:39,137 --> 00:17:42,305
Hmm. You do get me.

389
00:17:45,510 --> 00:17:47,343
Someone left a comment.

390
00:17:47,345 --> 00:17:48,611
Yeah. What did they say?

391
00:17:48,613 --> 00:17:50,613
"Too bad your show is done.

392
00:17:50,615 --> 00:17:52,615
I kind of liked it."

393
00:17:52,617 --> 00:17:54,817
Leonard, did you hear that?

394
00:17:55,986 --> 00:17:58,154
Oh, the people are heartbroken!

395
00:17:59,957 --> 00:18:02,558
I can't take this away
from the world!

396
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:05,494
Fun with Flags is back!

397
00:18:05,496 --> 00:18:07,496
Congratulations.

398
00:18:07,498 --> 00:18:09,365
Let's celebrate!

399
00:18:10,902 --> 00:18:13,569
Sheldon,

400
00:18:13,571 --> 00:18:15,271
that wasn't for you!

401
00:18:15,273 --> 00:18:16,806
Oh, no, I'm not going
to drink it.

402
00:18:16,808 --> 00:18:18,307
I just wanted to hear the pop.

403
00:18:19,276 --> 00:18:22,845
Yeah, I knew it was coming.
Still scary.

404
00:18:34,614 --> 00:18:36,749
LeVar Burton?

405
00:18:36,751 --> 00:18:38,551
LeVar Burton!

406
00:18:38,553 --> 00:18:40,152
LeVar Burton!

407
00:18:40,154 --> 00:18:43,689
Ugh. What are you doing here?

408
00:18:43,691 --> 00:18:45,024
You told me not to call,

409
00:18:45,026 --> 00:18:47,460
and I didn't know how else
to give you the good news.

410
00:18:47,462 --> 00:18:51,163
Fun with Flags is back, and
you can be in the next episode.

411
00:18:51,165 --> 00:18:52,565
Wil Wheaton said, get a gate.

412
00:18:52,567 --> 00:18:54,037
I don't know why
I didn't get a gate.

413
00:18:54,061 --> 00:18:55,168
You...

414
00:18:55,471 --> 00:18:57,905
At least listen
to the premise.

415
00:18:57,908 --> 00:18:59,474
Since you were born
in Germany,

416
00:18:59,476 --> 00:19:02,410
I thought we could talk
about German flags.

417
00:19:02,411 --> 00:19:05,454
How do you feel about
dressing up like a swastika?

418
00:19:05,454 --> 00:19:11,954
