1
00:00:02,169 --> 00:00:04,608
Two one six four two zero

2
00:00:04,641 --> 00:00:06,579
one nine eight nine.

3
00:00:06,581 --> 00:00:10,356
And that, little lady,
is pi to a thousand places.

4
00:00:10,358 --> 00:00:12,388
I'd say I'm sorry I asked,

5
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:14,657
except I didn't.

6
00:00:14,659 --> 00:00:17,092
Oh, look, it's the
Scientific American

7
00:00:17,094 --> 00:00:19,904
that covered the paper
Leonard and I wrote.

8
00:00:19,906 --> 00:00:21,874
Oh, let me see.

9
00:00:21,876 --> 00:00:24,509
I have mixed feelings
about doing interviews.

10
00:00:24,511 --> 00:00:26,679
I like the part where I talk.

11
00:00:26,681 --> 00:00:30,353
I do not like the part
where the other man talks.

12
00:00:31,756 --> 00:00:34,627
Sheldon, this article doesn't
mention Leonard at all.

13
00:00:34,629 --> 00:00:36,396
Well, that
can't be right.

14
00:00:36,398 --> 00:00:39,468
It only refers to
“Dr. Cooper and his team.”

15
00:00:39,470 --> 00:00:41,365
Did you even talk about him?

16
00:00:41,367 --> 00:00:43,940
All I did was answer a few
questions about the theory.

17
00:00:43,942 --> 00:00:46,108
And then expressed my gratitude
that Scientific American

18
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:49,572
doesn't include any of those
smelly perfume cards.

19
00:00:49,574 --> 00:00:52,211
Poor Leonard.

20
00:00:52,213 --> 00:00:54,546
Why? The theory
he came up with

21
00:00:54,548 --> 00:00:56,210
just got mentioned in
Scientific American.

22
00:00:56,212 --> 00:00:57,578
He ought to be thrilled.

23
00:00:57,580 --> 00:00:59,019
He might not be.

24
00:00:59,021 --> 00:01:01,050
Oh, maybe you're right.

25
00:01:01,052 --> 00:01:03,385
He is kind of a lump.

26
00:01:03,387 --> 00:01:04,520
Think about it.

27
00:01:04,522 --> 00:01:06,457
How would you feel
if you were referred to

28
00:01:06,459 --> 00:01:08,162
as part of Leonard's team?

29
00:01:08,164 --> 00:01:10,428
Oh, I'd be incensed.

30
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:12,933
So you see what
I'm getting at?

31
00:01:12,935 --> 00:01:15,504
Squeaky wheel
gets the grease?

32
00:01:15,506 --> 00:01:16,906
No.

33
00:01:16,908 --> 00:01:18,810
Grass is always greener?

34
00:01:18,812 --> 00:01:20,515
Try again.

35
00:01:20,517 --> 00:01:22,179
Well, I don't know—
we're all Groot?

36
00:01:22,181 --> 00:01:24,284
Just tell me.

37
00:01:24,286 --> 00:01:26,356
Leonard is as much
a part of this paper

38
00:01:26,358 --> 00:01:28,420
as you are,
and he was overlooked.

39
00:01:28,422 --> 00:01:30,389
He's going to feel bad.

40
00:01:30,391 --> 00:01:32,661
But it wasn't my fault.

41
00:01:32,663 --> 00:01:34,196
I didn't exclude him.

42
00:01:34,198 --> 00:01:35,796
And I didn't write the article.

43
00:01:35,798 --> 00:01:38,868
Remember that time you didn't
get picked to pull the sword out

44
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:42,099
of the stone at Disneyland and
they let that other kid do it?

45
00:01:42,101 --> 00:01:44,308
Oh, that kid!

46
00:01:47,112 --> 00:01:50,553
Poor Leonard.

47
00:01:50,555 --> 00:01:52,353
Exactly.

48
00:01:52,355 --> 00:01:54,785
For the record,
that kid was a terrible choice.

49
00:01:54,787 --> 00:01:56,554
If you cry when you drop
your churro,

50
00:01:56,556 --> 00:01:59,131
you do not have what it takes

@elder_man

60
00:02:29,724 --> 00:02:32,787
Thanks for helping us sort
through all my mom's stuff.

61
00:02:32,789 --> 00:02:34,428
Of course.

62
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:35,693
I know what it's like

63
00:02:35,695 --> 00:02:38,364
having to go through
a loved one's possessions.

64
00:02:38,366 --> 00:02:41,005
My uncle was
a worshipper of Krishna.

65
00:02:41,007 --> 00:02:43,606
But after he died,
you know what we found?

66
00:02:43,608 --> 00:02:46,805
A statue of Shiva.

67
00:02:49,143 --> 00:02:50,812
It may not be
Crips and Bloods, okay?

68
00:02:50,814 --> 00:02:53,074
But in India, it's a thing.

69
00:02:54,643 --> 00:02:56,408
Well, it'll be good
that you're there.

70
00:02:56,410 --> 00:02:57,680
Howard's been having
trouble deciding

71
00:02:57,682 --> 00:02:59,616
what to keep
and what to let go.

72
00:02:59,618 --> 00:03:01,079
Well, it's hard.

73
00:03:01,081 --> 00:03:04,317
A lot of Ma's stuff
brings back fond memories.

74
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:05,747
Is that why you couldn't
get rid of

75
00:03:05,749 --> 00:03:08,550
her drawer
full of ketchup packets?

76
00:03:08,552 --> 00:03:11,714
Yes. It reminds me of us
eating out and her saying,

77
00:03:11,716 --> 00:03:14,750
“Quick, nobody's looking,
fill your pockets with ketchup"

78
00:03:22,083 --> 00:03:24,048
Leonard?

79
00:03:24,050 --> 00:03:27,151
Have you ever noticed that

80
00:03:27,153 --> 00:03:30,885
only my name is
on the cable bill?

81
00:03:30,887 --> 00:03:33,389
Yeah.

82
00:03:33,391 --> 00:03:36,094
Good, good.

83
00:03:36,096 --> 00:03:37,997
And your name is
on the electric bill

84
00:03:37,999 --> 00:03:39,893
and mine isn't.

85
00:03:39,895 --> 00:03:41,196
And I'm okay with that.

86
00:03:41,198 --> 00:03:43,668
Actually, your name is
on the electric bill.

87
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:45,603
Oh, right.

88
00:03:47,405 --> 00:03:50,504
This is a disaster.

89
00:03:50,506 --> 00:03:53,936
I don't even know what you're
talking about and I agree.

90
00:03:53,938 --> 00:03:57,642
Okay, I have
to tell you something,

91
00:03:57,644 --> 00:03:59,651
but you're not going to like it.

92
00:03:59,653 --> 00:04:01,052
What's going on?

93
00:04:01,054 --> 00:04:03,517
An article was just published

94
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:06,526
in Scientific American
about our theory.

95
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:08,127
Did they hate it?

96
00:04:08,129 --> 00:04:10,199
No. No, they loved it.

97
00:04:10,201 --> 00:04:12,798
They, uh, couldn't say enough
nice things about it.

98
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:15,365
So what's the problem?

99
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,838
You know how the PennySaver
only has my name...

100
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:21,103
Sheldon!

101
00:04:21,105 --> 00:04:23,775
They didn't mention you
in the article.

102
00:04:23,777 --> 00:04:25,174
Only me.

103
00:04:25,176 --> 00:04:26,981
Really?

104
00:04:26,983 --> 00:04:28,109
I know.

105
00:04:28,111 --> 00:04:30,318
It's not fair.

106
00:04:32,722 --> 00:04:35,226
Let the anger
go, buddy.

107
00:04:35,228 --> 00:04:36,658
You just...

108
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:39,363
you relax all
your muscles.

109
00:04:39,365 --> 00:04:42,098
Except for your pubococcygeus
and anal sphincter.

110
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:44,666
Let's keep those tight.

111
00:04:44,668 --> 00:04:47,937
Uh, that-that's not necessary.

112
00:04:47,939 --> 00:04:50,535
It is— they're what hold back
the urine and the feces.

113
00:04:50,537 --> 00:04:53,471
Look, maybe-maybe
you shouldn't read it.

114
00:04:53,473 --> 00:04:55,407
It'll only make you feel worse.

115
00:04:55,409 --> 00:04:57,943
“Cooper and his team”?

116
00:04:57,945 --> 00:05:00,417
You should know
I had nothing to do with that.

117
00:05:00,419 --> 00:05:02,482
Uh...

118
00:05:02,484 --> 00:05:05,154
at least they're talking
about the theory.

119
00:05:05,156 --> 00:05:07,385
I mean, that's what's important.

120
00:05:07,387 --> 00:05:09,857
You know, you're right.

121
00:05:09,859 --> 00:05:12,929
Yeah. You know, it's like
when Stan Lee and Steve Ditko

122
00:05:12,931 --> 00:05:14,698
created Spider-Man.

123
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:16,531
Stan Lee may get all the credit,

124
00:05:16,533 --> 00:05:19,508
but Steve Ditko knows
he was just as important.

125
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:22,403
Even though Stan Lee gets
to be in all the Marvel movies.

126
00:05:22,405 --> 00:05:24,041
And-and he's far richer.

127
00:05:24,043 --> 00:05:26,239
And he's a household name,
you know?

128
00:05:26,241 --> 00:05:28,543
Whereas, you know,
you say Ditko,

129
00:05:28,545 --> 00:05:31,214
and that sounds like
a company that makes Dits.

130
00:05:33,447 --> 00:05:35,518
That's not helping.

131
00:05:37,016 --> 00:05:38,886
Well, I'd give more examples,

132
00:05:38,888 --> 00:05:42,359
but, well, everyone in
your position's so forgettable.

133
00:05:44,793 --> 00:05:47,126
Stuart, we're here.

134
00:05:47,128 --> 00:05:49,998
It's nice of you to let him keep
staying at your mom's house.

135
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,598
Yeah, well, I tried putting him
out on the curb,

136
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,469
but nobody took him.

137
00:05:55,399 --> 00:05:57,069
Hey.

138
00:05:57,071 --> 00:05:59,068
Just so you know,
the power's out.

139
00:05:59,070 --> 00:06:00,267
What happened?

140
00:06:00,269 --> 00:06:02,570
I called,
they said a transformer blew.

141
00:06:02,572 --> 00:06:03,642
It's the whole block.

142
00:06:03,644 --> 00:06:04,874
Should be fixed by tomorrow.

143
00:06:04,876 --> 00:06:06,704
Wait, when did it go out?

144
00:06:06,706 --> 00:06:08,176
In the middle of the night.

145
00:06:08,178 --> 00:06:10,881
Oh, my God.

146
00:06:10,883 --> 00:06:13,250
Howie, what's wrong?

147
00:06:16,128 --> 00:06:17,759
It's all defrosting.

148
00:06:17,761 --> 00:06:19,424
It's okay. It's just food.

149
00:06:19,426 --> 00:06:22,203
It's not just food.

150
00:06:22,205 --> 00:06:25,267
This is the last food
my mother ever made.

151
00:06:26,309 --> 00:06:27,603
This is her
last brisket.

152
00:06:27,605 --> 00:06:29,275
This is her
last meatloaf.

153
00:06:29,277 --> 00:06:30,739
This is her last...

154
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:35,344
I have no idea
what this is, but...

155
00:06:35,346 --> 00:06:38,215
it's the last one.

156
00:06:38,217 --> 00:06:39,815
Everything okay?

157
00:06:39,817 --> 00:06:41,015
No.

158
00:06:41,017 --> 00:06:44,015
All Ma's food is
gonna be ruined.

159
00:06:44,017 --> 00:06:46,423
Well, why don't we take it home
and put it in our freezer?

160
00:06:46,425 --> 00:06:48,054
You don't want
to do that.

161
00:06:48,056 --> 00:06:50,022
Refreezing not only
removes moisture,

162
00:06:50,024 --> 00:06:52,325
but it creates ice crystals
in the fibers of the meat

163
00:06:52,327 --> 00:06:55,228
that can compromise
its taste and texture.

164
00:06:56,566 --> 00:06:57,963
What? I saw a teachable moment.

165
00:06:57,965 --> 00:07:00,395
I dropped some culinary science.

166
00:07:02,436 --> 00:07:04,267
What should we do?

167
00:07:04,269 --> 00:07:06,603
I'll tell you exactly
what we're gonna do.

168
00:07:06,605 --> 00:07:08,444
We're gonna eat it.

169
00:07:08,446 --> 00:07:10,340
There's, like, 20 pounds
of food in there.

170
00:07:10,342 --> 00:07:11,444
All you said

171
00:07:11,446 --> 00:07:13,013
was I had to get rid of things.

172
00:07:13,015 --> 00:07:16,015
You didn't say they couldn't
pass through my colon first.

173
00:07:16,017 --> 00:07:19,287
Howie...

174
00:07:19,289 --> 00:07:20,920
Okay.

175
00:07:20,922 --> 00:07:23,392
Then how about this?

176
00:07:23,394 --> 00:07:25,562
Let's invite everyone
over to dinner.

177
00:07:25,564 --> 00:07:29,570
It'll be like Ma's feeding us
one last time.

178
00:07:29,572 --> 00:07:32,474
I love that.

179
00:07:33,676 --> 00:07:36,106
Me, too.

180
00:07:36,108 --> 00:07:38,106
Oh, look,
we've got enough ketchup

181
00:07:38,108 --> 00:07:40,442
to cover every ounce of it.

182
00:07:42,851 --> 00:07:46,584
I mean, who even reads
Scientific American?

183
00:07:47,850 --> 00:07:51,454
It's kind of
a big deal.

184
00:07:51,456 --> 00:07:53,852
If it's such a big deal,
how come the biggest celebrity

185
00:07:53,854 --> 00:07:56,586
they could get for the cover
is a molecule?

186
00:07:58,260 --> 00:08:00,322
Can we please just
stop talking about it?

187
00:08:00,324 --> 00:08:02,194
I'm sorry.
What can I do?

188
00:08:02,196 --> 00:08:04,362
Nothing, I'm fine.

189
00:08:04,364 --> 00:08:06,666
No, no.
I'm gonna cheer you up.

190
00:08:08,404 --> 00:08:10,300
Here we go.

191
00:08:10,302 --> 00:08:11,572
What are we doing?

192
00:08:11,574 --> 00:08:13,372
I am taking you shopping.
Oh.

193
00:08:13,374 --> 00:08:17,044
My baby is sad, and I'm gonna
make him happy again.

194
00:08:17,046 --> 00:08:18,908
Look, I know shopping
cheers you up,

195
00:08:18,910 --> 00:08:20,915
but it's just not
really my thing.

196
00:08:20,917 --> 00:08:22,580
Well, what about
this helicopter

197
00:08:22,582 --> 00:08:24,251
you control with an iPad?

198
00:08:24,253 --> 00:08:27,154
Does it have
a camera in it?

199
00:08:27,156 --> 00:08:30,552
It does have
a camera in it.

200
00:08:30,554 --> 00:08:33,318
Baby's listening.

201
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:35,085
Leonard?

202
00:08:35,087 --> 00:08:37,019
- Leonard?
- Leonard?

203
00:08:37,021 --> 00:08:38,122
What?

204
00:08:38,124 --> 00:08:40,393
I spoke to the reporter
at the magazine.

205
00:08:42,490 --> 00:08:44,793
What happened?
Did you tell him it was my idea?

206
00:08:44,795 --> 00:08:45,825
I did.

207
00:08:45,827 --> 00:08:47,665
Thank you. What did he say?

208
00:08:47,667 --> 00:08:50,497
He said they made
the editorial decision

209
00:08:50,499 --> 00:08:52,537
to only cite the lead scientist.

210
00:08:52,539 --> 00:08:55,041
Why did he think
you're the lead scientist?

211
00:08:55,043 --> 00:08:56,937
It was my idea!

212
00:08:56,939 --> 00:08:58,175
You know,
for an extra four bucks,

213
00:08:58,177 --> 00:09:00,110
I can have this thing
here tomorrow.

214
00:09:00,112 --> 00:09:02,278
Well, I know it
was your idea,

215
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:05,446
but the reporter said he's been
following my work for a while,

216
00:09:05,448 --> 00:09:07,446
and the only reason they even
mentioned it in the magazine

217
00:09:07,448 --> 00:09:08,718
is 'cause my name is on it.

218
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:11,550
You know what? I did it.
What's four bucks?

219
00:09:11,552 --> 00:09:13,485
If you're trying
to make me feel better,

220
00:09:13,487 --> 00:09:14,956
it's not working.

221
00:09:14,958 --> 00:09:17,691
Well... then what if I told you

222
00:09:17,693 --> 00:09:20,995
that I added your name
to the cable bill?

223
00:09:22,765 --> 00:09:25,196
No.
Oh.

224
00:09:25,198 --> 00:09:26,701
That's just as well.
They had me on hold

225
00:09:26,703 --> 00:09:28,731
for 20 minutes and I hung up.
I...

226
00:09:29,765 --> 00:09:32,542
- Leonard?
- Leonard?

227
00:09:32,544 --> 00:09:34,341
Leonard?

228
00:09:36,479 --> 00:09:41,117
Also, Wolowitz invited us all
to dinner, so...

229
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:43,853
I'm ready whenever you are.

230
00:09:52,175 --> 00:09:54,676
All he had was an idea.

231
00:09:54,678 --> 00:09:56,411
Well, that is an important part.

232
00:09:56,413 --> 00:09:57,676
Oh, please!

233
00:09:57,678 --> 00:09:59,613
I have ideas all day long.

234
00:09:59,615 --> 00:10:03,452
Reverse SeaWorld where dolphins
are allowed to pet people.

235
00:10:04,781 --> 00:10:09,217
A new clothing size between
medium and large called Marge.

236
00:10:10,218 --> 00:10:12,950
Snow White retold from
the point of view of Sneezy.

237
00:10:12,952 --> 00:10:15,020
Why won't Doc
prescribe him something?

238
00:10:15,022 --> 00:10:17,491
We finally find out.

239
00:10:17,493 --> 00:10:19,523
But Leonard's idea was good.

240
00:10:21,356 --> 00:10:24,624
Fine. Then Grumpy—
what's he so grumpy about?

241
00:10:24,626 --> 00:10:27,362
Maybe his girlfriend
won't take his side.

242
00:10:28,964 --> 00:10:31,468
I'm the one
who thought of it!

243
00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:33,538
Well, didn't he do
a lot of the work?

244
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:35,674
But now he's happy
to let people think

245
00:10:35,676 --> 00:10:38,409
he's responsible for everything.

246
00:10:38,411 --> 00:10:41,640
And that's why you get
an iPad helicopter!

247
00:10:43,043 --> 00:10:46,649
Is it my fault I have a much
bigger reputation than he does?

248
00:10:46,651 --> 00:10:47,848
It's not your fault.

249
00:10:47,850 --> 00:10:49,751
Is it my fault
that my name came first

250
00:10:49,753 --> 00:10:51,414
on the paper alphabetically?

251
00:10:51,416 --> 00:10:52,622
Not your fault.

252
00:10:52,624 --> 00:10:54,453
Is it my fault
that when the reporter cited me

253
00:10:54,455 --> 00:10:56,555
as the lead scientist
I didn't correct him?

254
00:10:56,557 --> 00:10:59,321
Hey, look at that pretty bird.

255
00:11:00,859 --> 00:11:02,592
He always needs
all the attention.

256
00:11:02,594 --> 00:11:03,759
He's such a baby.

257
00:11:03,761 --> 00:11:05,326
I know, I know.

258
00:11:05,328 --> 00:11:07,926
I swear, he is never ever
playing with my helicopter.

259
00:11:11,495 --> 00:11:14,765
Okay, I'll start heating
some of this stuff up.

260
00:11:14,767 --> 00:11:16,037
Thanks.

261
00:11:16,039 --> 00:11:17,534
Oh, man.

262
00:11:17,536 --> 00:11:21,403
This is the boutonniere
from my high school prom...

263
00:11:22,371 --> 00:11:26,135
a piece of cake
from my Bar Mitzvah.

264
00:11:26,137 --> 00:11:27,671
Did she throw
anything away?

265
00:11:27,673 --> 00:11:28,839
No.

266
00:11:28,841 --> 00:11:32,244
If I find my foreskin,
I'm gonna kill myself.

267
00:11:34,139 --> 00:11:37,342
Okay, so we've got, um,

268
00:11:37,344 --> 00:11:40,243
three briskets, four
meatloafs, one lasagna...

269
00:11:40,245 --> 00:11:42,042
No, that's noodle kugel.

270
00:11:42,044 --> 00:11:44,174
One Jewish lasagna...

271
00:11:45,241 --> 00:11:48,245
two pound cakes that are
about eight pounds each,

272
00:11:48,247 --> 00:11:51,380
and one giant container
of matzah ball soup.

273
00:11:51,382 --> 00:11:55,748
Ma always kept it on hand,

274
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:58,547
in case I got sick.

275
00:11:58,549 --> 00:12:03,354
She thought she could cure
anything with her cooking.

276
00:12:03,356 --> 00:12:06,457
Even the time
I got food poisoning.

277
00:12:08,292 --> 00:12:10,299
From her cooking.

278
00:12:12,134 --> 00:12:13,964
You okay?

279
00:12:13,966 --> 00:12:16,971
Yeah, I'm okay.

280
00:12:16,973 --> 00:12:18,507
Let's get started.

281
00:12:18,509 --> 00:12:20,169
You got it.

282
00:12:24,947 --> 00:12:28,143
I'm never
gonna talk to her again.

283
00:12:36,172 --> 00:12:38,104
Should we tell
everyone not to come?

284
00:12:38,106 --> 00:12:41,203
No. I want to do this.

285
00:12:41,205 --> 00:12:44,274
Okay. Well, I'll keep
it together if you can.

286
00:12:44,276 --> 00:12:46,538
Okay.

287
00:12:47,508 --> 00:12:49,978
I'm not making any promises!

288
00:12:53,053 --> 00:12:54,747
Glad you guys
could make it.

289
00:12:54,749 --> 00:12:55,714
Of course.

290
00:12:55,716 --> 00:12:57,218
Wow, it looks really
pretty in here.

291
00:12:57,220 --> 00:13:00,754
Yeah, turns out half a dozen
menorahs really sets a mood.

292
00:13:02,827 --> 00:13:04,088
So, Stuart,
have you thought about

293
00:13:04,090 --> 00:13:05,961
what you'd do
if Howard sells the house?

294
00:13:05,963 --> 00:13:08,096
And there goes the mood.

295
00:13:08,098 --> 00:13:10,159
Hi. Hello.

296
00:13:10,161 --> 00:13:12,093
Oh, and a special
hello to Leonard,

297
00:13:12,095 --> 00:13:15,826
who needs to be
mentioned by name.

298
00:13:15,828 --> 00:13:17,464
Subtle.

299
00:13:17,466 --> 00:13:18,960
But you got it, right?

300
00:13:20,601 --> 00:13:21,766
Hey, guys.

301
00:13:21,768 --> 00:13:23,196
Hey.
Hi. Hello.

302
00:13:23,198 --> 00:13:24,467
I just want
everyone to know,

303
00:13:24,469 --> 00:13:27,604
uh, tonight's not
a sad occasion.

304
00:13:27,606 --> 00:13:29,500
Yeah, we just want to have
the kind of dinner

305
00:13:29,502 --> 00:13:31,171
that we've all had here
so many times before.

306
00:13:31,173 --> 00:13:33,938
Good food, good friends, and
sometime around midnight,

307
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:36,669
heartburn that makes
you pray for death.

308
00:13:37,638 --> 00:13:39,675
Do you need any help
in the kitchen?

309
00:13:39,677 --> 00:13:42,273
No, we got it. You guys
make yourselves comfortable.

310
00:13:43,739 --> 00:13:46,840
All right, hey, you two, we're
here for Howard right now, okay?

311
00:13:46,842 --> 00:13:48,881
Yes, so please
behave yourselves.

312
00:13:48,883 --> 00:13:50,777
Fine.
Of course.

313
00:13:53,481 --> 00:13:56,380
So I heard you two, uh,
wrote a paper together.

314
00:13:56,382 --> 00:13:57,747
How's that going?

315
00:14:01,523 --> 00:14:03,553
This food is amazing.

316
00:14:03,555 --> 00:14:06,186
Mm, and not
a vegetable in sight.

317
00:14:06,188 --> 00:14:07,426
That's not true.

318
00:14:07,428 --> 00:14:09,025
We've got tomatoes right here.

319
00:14:11,396 --> 00:14:14,802
All these bright people sitting
around a table by candlelight.

320
00:14:14,804 --> 00:14:18,097
Feels like we could be an
18th century French salon.

321
00:14:18,099 --> 00:14:19,537
Indeed.

322
00:14:19,539 --> 00:14:22,643
Penny, a salon is a gathering

323
00:14:22,645 --> 00:14:24,778
where intellectuals
entertained each other

324
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:27,145
with sparkling conversations
about issues of the day.

325
00:14:27,147 --> 00:14:29,480
Oh, so it's like The View.

326
00:14:31,882 --> 00:14:36,321
Sheldon, The View is a daytime
talk show hosted by women.

327
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:38,428
Oh, I'm aware.

328
00:14:38,430 --> 00:14:40,028
It features Whoopi Goldberg.

329
00:14:40,030 --> 00:14:42,932
She played Guinan on
Star Trek: Next Gen.

330
00:14:42,934 --> 00:14:45,334
Penny, Next Gen
refers to Star Trek...

331
00:14:45,336 --> 00:14:46,639
Shut up.

332
00:14:48,572 --> 00:14:51,612
I would like to
propose a salon topic.

333
00:14:51,614 --> 00:14:53,044
Ooh, please do, Rajesh.

334
00:14:53,046 --> 00:14:55,256
The lead in The Hunger
Games is a woman.

335
00:14:55,258 --> 00:14:57,594
Marvel has made
“Tor” a female.

336
00:14:58,292 --> 00:14:59,363
Wait, who's Tor?

337
00:14:59,365 --> 00:15:03,533
You know, Tor,
the God of “Tunder.”

338
00:15:04,303 --> 00:15:07,205
As I was saying,
is this a sign

339
00:15:07,207 --> 00:15:10,479
that our society is
approaching gender equality?

340
00:15:10,481 --> 00:15:13,983
Certainly a lot more women
are reading comic books now.

341
00:15:13,985 --> 00:15:15,079
It's true.

342
00:15:15,081 --> 00:15:19,151
At the store, I had to put
a seat on the toilet.

343
00:15:19,153 --> 00:15:20,584
We won't know
if there's equality

344
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:22,423
until female Thor has a baby

345
00:15:22,425 --> 00:15:25,855
and the Avengers are cool with
her pumping breast milk at work.

346
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:28,693
I wonder if only a baby
who is worthy

347
00:15:28,695 --> 00:15:30,693
can suckle at the bosom of Thor.

348
00:15:30,695 --> 00:15:32,733
Okay, new salon topic.

349
00:15:32,735 --> 00:15:35,565
Salons— dumb thing
from a long time ago

350
00:15:35,567 --> 00:15:38,805
or interesting thing made dumb
by talking about superheroes?

351
00:15:38,807 --> 00:15:39,973
Discuss.

352
00:15:41,303 --> 00:15:43,740
I don't believe it matters
what the topic is.

353
00:15:43,742 --> 00:15:45,971
What's crucial for a salon

354
00:15:45,973 --> 00:15:47,475
is that we conduct
the discussion

355
00:15:47,477 --> 00:15:49,875
in an elevated
and insightful way.

356
00:15:49,877 --> 00:15:51,780
It's all about the execution.

357
00:15:51,782 --> 00:15:55,449
Of course you'd focus on that
rather than the inspiration.

358
00:15:55,451 --> 00:15:57,017
Uh, new salon topic.

359
00:15:57,019 --> 00:16:00,087
What's more important,
an idea or its execution?

360
00:16:00,089 --> 00:16:01,583
Oh, that's fun.

361
00:16:01,585 --> 00:16:03,223
Yeah, good for you, Leonard.

362
00:16:03,225 --> 00:16:04,823
That's a lovely little notion.

363
00:16:04,825 --> 00:16:06,023
Kind of like,

364
00:16:06,025 --> 00:16:08,558
“I wish I could talk
to my uncle in Chicago.”

365
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:11,660
Yeah, now stand back
while I invent the telephone.

366
00:16:11,662 --> 00:16:13,659
“Hello? Oh, hold on.”

367
00:16:13,661 --> 00:16:14,859
Leonard, it's your uncle.

368
00:16:14,861 --> 00:16:17,268
He says you just got burned.

369
00:16:18,439 --> 00:16:19,405
Sheldon.

370
00:16:19,407 --> 00:16:20,870
You guys.
No, it's okay.

371
00:16:20,872 --> 00:16:23,237
We're all adults trying to have
an intelligent discussion.

372
00:16:23,239 --> 00:16:24,373
At least I am.

373
00:16:24,375 --> 00:16:25,741
Howard, what
do you think?

374
00:16:25,743 --> 00:16:30,478
Well, I guess, as an engineer,
I lean towards execution.

375
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:31,549
I spend my days

376
00:16:31,551 --> 00:16:32,813
trying to take

377
00:16:32,815 --> 00:16:34,518
ideas and make them real.

378
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:36,789
Well said, old chap.

379
00:16:36,791 --> 00:16:39,487
I thought eloquence had died;
here it stands before us.

380
00:16:39,489 --> 00:16:41,464
Starting today, it'll go:
Gettysburg Address,

381
00:16:41,466 --> 00:16:44,264
“I have a dream”
and what you just said.

382
00:16:44,266 --> 00:16:45,600
Oh, now he's a genius?

383
00:16:45,602 --> 00:16:48,102
All you ever do is make fun
of him and engineering.

384
00:16:48,104 --> 00:16:51,198
Leonard, please.
His mother just died.

385
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:53,101
You're being ridiculous.

386
00:16:53,103 --> 00:16:54,236
Yeah, so are you.

387
00:16:54,238 --> 00:16:55,868
Guys, if I wanted to hear
people be bitchy,

388
00:16:55,870 --> 00:16:57,172
I'd go to my real salon.

389
00:16:57,174 --> 00:16:59,972
Leonard, lots of people
could've had that idea,

390
00:16:59,974 --> 00:17:01,245
but very few people could've

391
00:17:01,247 --> 00:17:03,014
worked out the math
the way I did.

392
00:17:03,016 --> 00:17:05,447
Lots of people
also didn't have that idea,

393
00:17:05,449 --> 00:17:08,426
like everyone in the entire
world except for me.

394
00:17:08,428 --> 00:17:10,291
Oh, well,
apparently Leonard thinks

395
00:17:10,293 --> 00:17:12,227
he's better than everyone
in the whole world,

396
00:17:12,229 --> 00:17:13,331
including those

397
00:17:13,333 --> 00:17:14,667
fighting for our freedom.

398
00:17:14,669 --> 00:17:16,132
Yeah, well,
I don't know about you,

399
00:17:16,134 --> 00:17:17,900
but I support our boys overseas.

400
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:20,943
And girls.

401
00:17:20,945 --> 00:17:23,777
Hey, you already ruined Thor;
give it a rest.

402
00:17:24,915 --> 00:17:26,280
So I'm just supposed to be okay

403
00:17:26,282 --> 00:17:28,351
with you hogging
all the credit?

404
00:17:28,353 --> 00:17:30,150
I didn't hog anything.

405
00:17:30,152 --> 00:17:33,548
Unlike you and that weird
lasagna with raisins in it.

406
00:17:33,550 --> 00:17:34,788
You want some of this?

407
00:17:34,790 --> 00:17:36,250
- I'll give you some.
- Hey!

408
00:17:36,252 --> 00:17:38,185
Sheldon, Leonard,
living room, right now!

409
00:17:44,129 --> 00:17:47,863
She said my name first;
that must kill you.

410
00:17:47,865 --> 00:17:50,030
I don't know
what you think you're doing,

411
00:17:50,032 --> 00:17:52,397
but this is a very difficult
time for my husband!

412
00:17:52,399 --> 00:17:55,197
We're eating the last food
his mother ever made,

413
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:57,669
and you were gonna throw it
at each other like children?

414
00:17:57,671 --> 00:17:59,902
Whatever it is you're
fighting about, put it aside,

415
00:17:59,904 --> 00:18:02,111
go back in there
and be a good friend to Howard

416
00:18:02,113 --> 00:18:04,976
or there's no dessert
for either of you!

417
00:18:07,019 --> 00:18:09,482
Look at me
when I'm talking to you!

418
00:18:09,484 --> 00:18:10,922
And don't think...

419
00:18:10,924 --> 00:18:15,227
You guys ever notice sometimes
Bernadette sounds like my mom?

420
00:18:15,229 --> 00:18:17,331
I don't hear it.
No, not at all.

421
00:18:33,802 --> 00:18:37,042
I don't think I've eaten
that much in my entire life.

422
00:18:37,044 --> 00:18:40,307
It's why my people wandered
the desert for 40 years.

423
00:18:40,309 --> 00:18:43,043
Took that long to walk it off.

424
00:18:44,644 --> 00:18:46,776
You see, Penny, the Israelites
were in the desert...

425
00:18:46,778 --> 00:18:49,183
Shut up!

426
00:18:49,185 --> 00:18:52,216
So glad you two
are done fighting.

427
00:18:52,218 --> 00:18:56,823
Right now, I'm just trying
to burp without throwing up.

428
00:18:56,825 --> 00:18:57,887
Hang on.

429
00:18:57,889 --> 00:19:00,861
Physics Today
mentioned the paper.

430
00:19:00,863 --> 00:19:01,956
What'd they say?

431
00:19:01,958 --> 00:19:04,355
Who cares?
Did they mention Leonard?

432
00:19:04,357 --> 00:19:05,458
They did.

433
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:07,088
Yay.

434
00:19:08,593 --> 00:19:10,531
Good news, I found more Tums.

435
00:19:10,555 --> 00:19:12,313
Yay!

436
00:19:12,895 --> 00:19:19,395
