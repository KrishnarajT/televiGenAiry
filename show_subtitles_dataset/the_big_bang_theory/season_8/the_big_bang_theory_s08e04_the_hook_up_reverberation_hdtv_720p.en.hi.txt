1
00:00:03,127 --> 00:00:05,093
Have you guys heard
about this research team

2
00:00:05,095 --> 00:00:08,296
that's trying to transgenically
manipulate chicken DNA

3
00:00:08,298 --> 00:00:10,632
to create some sort
of chicken dinosaur?

4
00:00:10,634 --> 00:00:13,635
Oh, I think that
sounds wonderful.

5
00:00:14,972 --> 00:00:18,640
What? You're afraid
of both dinosaurs and chickens.

6
00:00:18,642 --> 00:00:19,642
Yes, but tell me

7
00:00:19,643 --> 00:00:21,843
a dinosaur
chicken salad sandwich

8
00:00:21,845 --> 00:00:23,545
wouldn't hit the Mesozoic spot.

9
00:00:26,984 --> 00:00:28,250
Hey, guys.
Hey. Hello.

10
00:00:28,252 --> 00:00:29,785
We still on for
tomorrow night?

11
00:00:29,787 --> 00:00:31,853
Yeah. I'm excited
to finally meet your girlfriend.

12
00:00:31,855 --> 00:00:33,989
Yeah, oh, and
speaking of which.

13
00:00:33,991 --> 00:00:36,758
According to a recent study
out of Oxford University,

14
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:38,026
when someone takes on

15
00:00:38,028 --> 00:00:39,861
a new romantic
partner,

16
00:00:39,863 --> 00:00:42,731
that person loses one
or two close friends.

17
00:00:42,733 --> 00:00:45,500
Since when do you read
social science?

18
00:00:45,502 --> 00:00:48,470
I go to the bathroom
like everybody else.

19
00:00:48,472 --> 00:00:49,838
Why would I lose friends

20
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:51,740
just because I
started dating someone?

21
00:00:51,742 --> 00:00:53,775
Yeah, you didn't lose anyone
when you met Amy.

22
00:00:53,777 --> 00:00:56,978
Yeah, well, no, the study
refers to romantic partners.

23
00:00:56,980 --> 00:01:00,215
Not the way I would
categorize the two of us.

24
00:01:00,217 --> 00:01:01,817
You guys kiss and hold hands.

25
00:01:01,819 --> 00:01:04,252
I've seen him do it.
It's not romantic.

26
00:01:04,254 --> 00:01:06,454
Look, I'm not the kind of guy

27
00:01:06,456 --> 00:01:09,257
who drops his friends just
because he's in a relationship.

28
00:01:09,259 --> 00:01:10,926
What happens
if she doesn't like us?

29
00:01:10,928 --> 00:01:12,294
Well, hey,
you're my dear friends.

30
00:01:12,296 --> 00:01:14,663
You'll get a Christmas card
for a couple of years,

31
00:01:14,665 --> 00:01:16,231

@elder_man

42
00:01:47,367 --> 00:01:50,635
So, Howard, is Stuart still
living with your mom?

43
00:01:50,637 --> 00:01:52,436
I don't want
to talk about it.

44
00:01:52,438 --> 00:01:54,839
But he's going to.
My mom got him cable!

45
00:01:54,841 --> 00:01:56,974
In my whole life,

46
00:01:56,976 --> 00:01:58,743
growing up
in that house— no cable.

47
00:01:58,745 --> 00:02:00,178
Do you know how many HBOs

48
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:02,180
that leech had my mother
get him? Seven.

49
00:02:02,182 --> 00:02:04,515
Seven HBOs. Seven!

50
00:02:04,517 --> 00:02:08,262
Long story short,
they have seven HBOs.

51
00:02:08,264 --> 00:02:09,563
Hey, guys.

52
00:02:09,565 --> 00:02:11,465
Hey.
Hello. Hey.

53
00:02:11,467 --> 00:02:13,500
Emily, you know almost everybody here.
Hi.

54
00:02:13,502 --> 00:02:15,302
This is Leonard,
this is Penny.

55
00:02:15,304 --> 00:02:16,637
Oh, it's so nice
to meet you.

56
00:02:16,639 --> 00:02:18,372
Nice to finally meet you, too.
Hi.

57
00:02:18,374 --> 00:02:19,506
Hello.

58
00:02:19,508 --> 00:02:21,975
Well, Raj,
you were not lying about her.

59
00:02:21,977 --> 00:02:24,778
I told you
she exists.

60
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:26,813
Hey, I hear you're
a dermatologist.

61
00:02:26,815 --> 00:02:29,816
Uh, yeah, I'm a resident
at Huntington Hospital.

62
00:02:29,818 --> 00:02:32,352
Oh, I like their
emergency room.

63
00:02:32,354 --> 00:02:35,222
Yeah, even if it turns out
you don't have Dengue fever,

64
00:02:35,224 --> 00:02:37,624
they still let you
take a lollipop.

65
00:02:38,694 --> 00:02:40,360
You know, Penny
just started training

66
00:02:40,362 --> 00:02:42,095
to be a pharmaceutical
sales rep.

67
00:02:42,097 --> 00:02:44,264
Maybe she can practice
on you some time.

68
00:02:44,266 --> 00:02:46,967
Oh, it would be great
to practice on a real doctor.

69
00:02:46,969 --> 00:02:49,136
Yeah. I'm sure that'd be fine.

70
00:02:49,138 --> 00:02:52,839
I have some odd
freckles on my buttocks.

71
00:02:54,643 --> 00:02:58,312
Can I make an appointment
for you to look at them?

72
00:02:58,314 --> 00:03:00,781
Um... okay, I guess.

73
00:03:00,783 --> 00:03:03,617
I'm with him three
years, nothing.

74
00:03:03,619 --> 00:03:07,020
She's with two minutes, and
he's taking his pants off.

75
00:03:11,493 --> 00:03:14,094
Last night was fun.
What did you think of Emily?

76
00:03:14,096 --> 00:03:15,429
I don't know.

77
00:03:15,431 --> 00:03:17,598
I kind of got the sense
she didn't like me.

78
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:19,366
Did she say she didn't like you?

79
00:03:19,368 --> 00:03:20,500
Of course not. No one ever says

80
00:03:20,502 --> 00:03:22,035
they don't like you
straight to your face.

81
00:03:22,037 --> 00:03:25,906
We have led different lives.

82
00:03:27,309 --> 00:03:30,143
You guys just met.
Why would she feel that way?

83
00:03:30,145 --> 00:03:31,612
It's just this
vibe I got.

84
00:03:31,614 --> 00:03:33,594
I'm sure you're worried
about nothing.

85
00:03:33,595 --> 00:03:35,015
Yeah.
You're probably right.

86
00:03:35,017 --> 00:03:36,383
I used to think
my high school P.E. teacher

87
00:03:36,385 --> 00:03:37,618
didn't like me,
but it turned out,

88
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:39,786
she liked me a little too much.

89
00:03:39,788 --> 00:03:41,054
Really?
Yeah.

90
00:03:41,056 --> 00:03:42,289
It was fine.

91
00:03:42,291 --> 00:03:44,157
We went to a Melissa Etheridge
concert, I got an A,

92
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:45,826
it all worked out.

93
00:03:45,828 --> 00:03:49,162
When you go to Emily's office to
practice, you'll see. It's fine.

94
00:03:49,164 --> 00:03:50,864
Yeah, I hope you're right.

95
00:03:50,866 --> 00:03:52,833
You really went your entire life

96
00:03:52,835 --> 00:03:56,470
without anyone saying
“I hate you” to your face?

97
00:03:56,472 --> 00:03:58,038
Yeah.

98
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:02,042
I'd say it now,
but look at those cheekbones.

99
00:04:08,784 --> 00:04:10,784
I miss
Stuart's place.

100
00:04:10,786 --> 00:04:14,454
All this loud music
and exposed brick.

101
00:04:14,456 --> 00:04:16,723
What, is this
a comic book store,

102
00:04:16,725 --> 00:04:20,227
or a rave at the third
little pig's house?

103
00:04:21,297 --> 00:04:23,497
Yup, I wish
Stuart would reopen.

104
00:04:23,499 --> 00:04:25,499
I hate this place, too.

105
00:04:25,501 --> 00:04:27,301
Okay, him I believe

106
00:04:27,303 --> 00:04:30,470
because he's an 80-year-old man
in a 15-year-old's T-shirt.

107
00:04:30,472 --> 00:04:32,239
But you're just upset

108
00:04:32,241 --> 00:04:35,642
about Stuart and your mom
and all their HBOs.

109
00:04:35,644 --> 00:04:39,146
Yes, I am. You know, I can't
even watch Game of Thrones now

110
00:04:39,148 --> 00:04:40,814
without thinking
of mother saying,

111
00:04:40,816 --> 00:04:43,984
“Stuart, which one is Thrones?”

112
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:46,820
You know, he might not reopen.

113
00:04:46,822 --> 00:04:49,656
He didn't get a lot of money
from the insurance company.

114
00:04:49,658 --> 00:04:52,316
Oh, boy, if there is one thing
that gets my goat,

115
00:04:52,318 --> 00:04:55,619
those dad-gum
insurance companies.

116
00:04:55,621 --> 00:04:58,222
Why? Because they won't
get off your lawn?

117
00:05:01,427 --> 00:05:06,163
Oh, is Stuart trying to get a
loan, or-or find investors?

118
00:05:06,165 --> 00:05:08,198
All I know is,
he's got my mother

119
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:11,268
buying four-ply toilet paper.
I mean, four-ply.

120
00:05:12,304 --> 00:05:13,704
If his butt is so delicate,

121
00:05:13,706 --> 00:05:16,073
why doesn't he just use
an angora rabbit?

122
00:05:17,076 --> 00:05:20,143
For starters,
they shed and bite.

123
00:05:20,946 --> 00:05:22,779
Hey,

124
00:05:22,781 --> 00:05:24,248
here's a thought.

125
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:26,750
Why don't we put up the rest
of the money that Stuart needs?

126
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:31,388
So, we'd be, like, owners
of a comic book store?

127
00:05:32,958 --> 00:05:34,791
It's kind of a
dream come true.

128
00:05:34,793 --> 00:05:36,293
That does sound fun.

129
00:05:36,295 --> 00:05:37,828
Ooh, maybe we could come up

130
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:40,330
with a business plan
to compete with this place.

131
00:05:40,332 --> 00:05:42,199
I'll give you a plan right now.

132
00:05:42,201 --> 00:05:44,701
Step one:
open comic book store.

133
00:05:44,703 --> 00:05:46,169
Step two: start rumor

134
00:05:46,171 --> 00:05:49,473
this comic book store
gives you genital warts.

135
00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:55,279
Step three: buy a big bag
to put the money in.

136
00:05:57,449 --> 00:05:59,650
It's not that bad.

137
00:06:03,722 --> 00:06:07,024
Hey.
Hi.

138
00:06:07,026 --> 00:06:09,898
Thank you so much for letting me
practice my sales pitch on you.

139
00:06:09,899 --> 00:06:10,899
I really appreciate it.

140
00:06:10,907 --> 00:06:11,720
Sure.

141
00:06:11,744 --> 00:06:12,872
Um, I brought coffee.

142
00:06:12,873 --> 00:06:14,406
I wasn't sure what you like,
so I got

143
00:06:14,408 --> 00:06:16,642
a regular, a cappuccino
and a Chai tea.

144
00:06:16,644 --> 00:06:19,778
Since you like Raj, I thought
you might be into that.

145
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:23,081
Thanks. If we could get started.
I'm a little busy.

146
00:06:23,083 --> 00:06:25,851
Oh, yeah, sure. Let me
just get out my materials.

147
00:06:25,853 --> 00:06:27,352
Leonard gave me this briefcase.

148
00:06:27,354 --> 00:06:29,021
He used to carry it
around in high school.

149
00:06:29,023 --> 00:06:32,357
You can still see the dent
where they whacked him with it.

150
00:06:34,528 --> 00:06:36,628
Okay, I would like
to talk to you

151
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:38,897
about our new
birth control pill, Femevra.

152
00:06:38,899 --> 00:06:40,232
Great.

153
00:06:40,234 --> 00:06:42,267
So, Femevra's
triphasic design

154
00:06:42,269 --> 00:06:44,403
provides balanced
hormonal exposure.

155
00:06:44,405 --> 00:06:46,238
All right.

156
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:49,007
It has also been shown to cause

157
00:06:49,009 --> 00:06:52,044
significantly fewer side effects
than other oral contraceptives.

158
00:06:52,046 --> 00:06:54,913
Although it can cause acne,
which, if you ask me, kind of

159
00:06:54,915 --> 00:06:57,683
increases its effectiveness
as a contraceptive.

160
00:07:01,589 --> 00:07:03,255
Funny.

161
00:07:04,758 --> 00:07:07,559
Okay, I'm sorry. Did we get off
on the wrong foot?

162
00:07:07,561 --> 00:07:09,428
Because since the other
night, I kind of feel like

163
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:10,963
you might have a problem
with me.

164
00:07:10,965 --> 00:07:12,331
No, it's fine.

165
00:07:12,333 --> 00:07:14,900
Are you sure,
because it doesn't seem fine?

166
00:07:14,902 --> 00:07:17,135
Okay.

167
00:07:17,137 --> 00:07:18,937
If you really want
to talk about this,

168
00:07:18,939 --> 00:07:20,239
I do have a problem.

169
00:07:20,241 --> 00:07:22,507
Oh, my God.
Tell me— what did I do?

170
00:07:22,509 --> 00:07:23,875
Look, it's nothing. It's just...

171
00:07:23,877 --> 00:07:26,511
Raj told me that a while ago,
you two hooked up.

172
00:07:26,513 --> 00:07:30,782
What? Oh, why
would he say that?

173
00:07:30,784 --> 00:07:32,284
Did it not happen?

174
00:07:32,286 --> 00:07:35,053
Well, I wouldn't exactly
call it a hook-up.

175
00:07:35,055 --> 00:07:36,154
Did you kiss?

176
00:07:36,156 --> 00:07:38,123
Yeah.

177
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:39,125
Were you naked?

178
00:07:39,126 --> 00:07:41,526
Yeah.

179
00:07:41,528 --> 00:07:43,328
So, it was a hook-up.

180
00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:45,297
No.

181
00:07:45,299 --> 00:07:47,499
Yeah.

182
00:07:49,603 --> 00:07:53,272
So, what are some ways we
could set our comic book store

183
00:07:53,274 --> 00:07:54,940
apart from the
competition?

184
00:07:54,942 --> 00:07:56,675
Oh, kids buy comic books.
It would be great

185
00:07:56,677 --> 00:07:58,777
to figure out a way
to get more kids in the store.

186
00:07:58,779 --> 00:08:00,779
You know, when I was a
kid, I loved going there,

187
00:08:00,781 --> 00:08:02,781
but I could
never get a ride.

188
00:08:02,783 --> 00:08:06,785
Ooh, what if we got a van and
drove around and picked kids up?

189
00:08:10,958 --> 00:08:12,991
Nice.

190
00:08:14,194 --> 00:08:17,429
You mean,
like at parks and schools?

191
00:08:18,098 --> 00:08:20,966
Toy stores,
puppet shows.

192
00:08:20,968 --> 00:08:25,103
Hold on. So, your idea is
to get a van

193
00:08:25,105 --> 00:08:28,540
and cruise the streets looking
for kids to pick up?

194
00:08:30,077 --> 00:08:32,444
Yes.

195
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:37,316
And are you gonna use candy
to lure them in?

196
00:08:38,185 --> 00:08:40,719
We are now!

197
00:08:42,723 --> 00:08:44,990
You told Emily
we hooked up?

198
00:08:44,992 --> 00:08:48,360
Um, well, in my defense,
I tell everybody.

199
00:08:48,362 --> 00:08:49,761
Why would you say that?

200
00:08:49,763 --> 00:08:52,064
We were having a conversation
about past lovers.

201
00:08:52,066 --> 00:08:53,198
We weren't lovers! Come on.

202
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,466
Everyone knows
we didn't sleep together.

203
00:08:54,468 --> 00:08:55,767
We got drunk
and fooled around.

204
00:08:55,769 --> 00:08:57,536
Why couldn't you just
leave me out of it?

205
00:08:57,538 --> 00:08:58,670
Well, we were being honest.

206
00:08:58,672 --> 00:09:00,439
You would leave me
out of the conversation

207
00:09:00,441 --> 00:09:02,307
with the next guy
if you dump Leonard?

208
00:09:02,309 --> 00:09:05,477
Why say it?
Yes!

209
00:09:05,479 --> 00:09:07,846
Well, I would never
leave you off my list,

210
00:09:07,848 --> 00:09:09,481
and not just

211
00:09:09,483 --> 00:09:10,782
because, without you,

212
00:09:10,784 --> 00:09:13,218
we're playing fast and loose
with the word “list.”

213
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:15,253
Well, good job.
Now she hates me.

214
00:09:15,255 --> 00:09:17,422
Oh.

215
00:09:17,424 --> 00:09:19,691
Great.

216
00:09:19,693 --> 00:09:22,194
On the bright side,
that Oxford study was right.

217
00:09:22,196 --> 00:09:24,262
One friend down.

218
00:09:25,466 --> 00:09:29,534
I wonder who you're going
to lose next.

219
00:09:29,536 --> 00:09:31,937
You, okay? It's you.
You're-you're next!

220
00:09:33,807 --> 00:09:36,708
No. You're crazy about me.

221
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:43,281
I feel pretty... oh so pretty.

222
00:09:45,409 --> 00:09:47,643
I don't know what Emily's
so upset about anyway.

223
00:09:47,645 --> 00:09:50,579
Even if I had slept with him,
so what? Everyone has a past.

224
00:09:51,382 --> 00:09:54,049
Almost everyone has a past.

225
00:09:54,051 --> 00:09:55,484
Come on, look
how pretty you are.

226
00:09:55,486 --> 00:09:57,586
I'm sure this isn't
the first girl to hate you.

227
00:09:57,588 --> 00:10:00,189
It's not.

228
00:10:00,191 --> 00:10:02,825
And I'm sure
you can turn it around.

229
00:10:02,827 --> 00:10:05,127
How? You can't force someone
to like you.

230
00:10:05,129 --> 00:10:06,195
What if you just

231
00:10:06,197 --> 00:10:07,863
hang around and act
like her friend

232
00:10:07,865 --> 00:10:10,432
until you wear her down?
I mean, next thing you know,

233
00:10:10,434 --> 00:10:11,789
you're in her home,
you're eating her food,

234
00:10:11,813 --> 00:10:12,884
drinking her wine.

235
00:10:15,807 --> 00:10:17,406
No, that won't work.

236
00:10:17,408 --> 00:10:19,742
You're right. Cheers.

237
00:10:19,744 --> 00:10:21,010
Oh, I know.

238
00:10:21,012 --> 00:10:22,978
Why don't you use
your sales training

239
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:25,214
to go back down there
and sell yourself?

240
00:10:25,216 --> 00:10:26,615
What?
Yeah.

241
00:10:26,617 --> 00:10:28,184
But instead of selling a drug,

242
00:10:28,186 --> 00:10:29,985
you'd be selling Penny—
it's cute.

243
00:10:29,987 --> 00:10:31,020
It's stupid.

244
00:10:31,022 --> 00:10:33,222
Well, maybe people
would like you more

245
00:10:33,224 --> 00:10:35,991
if you didn't crap
all over their ideas.

246
00:10:35,993 --> 00:10:38,594
I'm gonna go with
Penny on this one.

247
00:10:38,596 --> 00:10:42,231
Then again, why wouldn't I?
I mean, we go way back.

248
00:10:42,233 --> 00:10:45,267
Oh, my God.
I didn't used to like you.

249
00:10:45,269 --> 00:10:48,470
Shh. Amy's here now.

250
00:10:51,309 --> 00:10:53,809
You know, the more
I think about it,

251
00:10:53,811 --> 00:10:57,446
the more intrigued I am
about having our own store.

252
00:10:57,448 --> 00:10:59,448
We'll get to see
all the new stuff

253
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:01,083
before it hits the shelves.

254
00:11:01,085 --> 00:11:02,985
And we'll get to have
fun interactions

255
00:11:02,987 --> 00:11:04,153
with our customers.

256
00:11:04,155 --> 00:11:07,790
“This isn't a library—
buy it or get out.”

257
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:10,759
You say things like that
all the time.

258
00:11:10,761 --> 00:11:13,028
Yes, but as a store owner,
I'll finally have a good comeback

259
00:11:13,030 --> 00:11:15,497
to, “You don't work here—
shut up.”

260
00:11:16,834 --> 00:11:19,168
Uh, do you know how Penny
told Raj he should have

261
00:11:19,170 --> 00:11:21,003
left her off his list?
Yeah.

262
00:11:21,005 --> 00:11:23,505
Well, do you think when she
and I had that conversation,

263
00:11:23,507 --> 00:11:25,007
she left people off her list?

264
00:11:25,009 --> 00:11:26,342
I'm sure she did.

265
00:11:26,344 --> 00:11:28,377
Why?

266
00:11:28,379 --> 00:11:30,112
Because if she hadn't,

267
00:11:30,114 --> 00:11:33,816
she'd still be wading
through the list.

268
00:11:33,818 --> 00:11:35,517
Will you stay out of this?

269
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:38,187
If only Penny
had said that once in a while.

270
00:11:40,291 --> 00:11:41,790
Hey, what difference
does it make?

271
00:11:41,792 --> 00:11:43,626
You're the one
she wants to marry.

272
00:11:43,628 --> 00:11:45,361
That's true.
Yeah, and I'm not sure

273
00:11:45,363 --> 00:11:48,330
that complete honesty
is always the best thing

274
00:11:48,332 --> 00:11:50,165
for a relationship.

275
00:11:50,167 --> 00:11:53,202
Yeah, he's right.
Once, in a moment of candor,

276
00:11:53,204 --> 00:11:56,038
I told Amy
that her hair reminded me

277
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:59,208
of a duck caught
in an oil spill. Well...

278
00:11:59,210 --> 00:12:01,076
she stormed out.

279
00:12:01,078 --> 00:12:03,746
Which was sad, because
we were playing Scrabble,

280
00:12:03,748 --> 00:12:08,150
and I had all the letters
to spell “persimmon.”

281
00:12:11,289 --> 00:12:13,656
Why are you even part
of this conversation?

282
00:12:13,658 --> 00:12:15,524
You don't know
anything about women.

283
00:12:15,526 --> 00:12:18,227
I know that if I had
a wife or a fiancée,

284
00:12:18,229 --> 00:12:20,296
I'd ask her first
before I invested money

285
00:12:20,298 --> 00:12:22,131
in a comic book store.

286
00:12:22,133 --> 00:12:23,866
He's right.

287
00:12:23,868 --> 00:12:24,934
Yeah, well,

288
00:12:24,936 --> 00:12:26,201
of course I am.

289
00:12:26,203 --> 00:12:27,636
I was also right about her hair.

290
00:12:27,638 --> 00:12:29,705
It did everything but quack.

291
00:12:32,877 --> 00:12:35,110
There's something
I wanted to run past you.

292
00:12:35,112 --> 00:12:37,279
What's up?
Mm, the guys and I

293
00:12:37,281 --> 00:12:40,049
were thinking about investing
in Stuart's comic book store.

294
00:12:40,051 --> 00:12:42,584
Is that okay?
Why are you asking me?

295
00:12:42,586 --> 00:12:44,420
Well, you know,
we're engaged,

296
00:12:44,422 --> 00:12:46,922
and it's kind of
a big deal financially.

297
00:12:46,924 --> 00:12:49,224
It seems like something
we should talk about.

298
00:12:49,226 --> 00:12:50,492
Oh.

299
00:12:50,494 --> 00:12:52,928
Well, would you consider
mounds of credit card debt

300
00:12:52,930 --> 00:12:55,464
kind of a big deal
financially?

301
00:12:57,435 --> 00:12:59,468
Yeah.

302
00:12:59,470 --> 00:13:01,070
Huh.

303
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:06,342
Mm. So, me and the guys
were talking about

304
00:13:06,344 --> 00:13:08,310
this great
investment opportunity...

305
00:13:08,312 --> 00:13:10,312
Nope.

306
00:13:10,314 --> 00:13:13,048
But you didn't hear what it was.

307
00:13:13,050 --> 00:13:15,818
I know.

308
00:13:16,687 --> 00:13:18,587
Oh, come on.

309
00:13:18,589 --> 00:13:20,055
Fine. What is it?

310
00:13:20,057 --> 00:13:22,157
It's to help reopen
the comic book store.

311
00:13:22,159 --> 00:13:23,926
Nope.

312
00:13:23,928 --> 00:13:26,028
Well, hear me out.

313
00:13:26,030 --> 00:13:28,230
Howard, you know
we're saving up for a house.

314
00:13:28,232 --> 00:13:30,566
I know, but all the guys
are doing it.

315
00:13:30,568 --> 00:13:33,469
We're splitting it four ways, so
it's really not that much money.

316
00:13:33,471 --> 00:13:36,238
It just seems
like a risky investment.

317
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,941
I get that. I...

318
00:13:39,844 --> 00:13:42,444
Okay, look...

319
00:13:43,981 --> 00:13:48,817
The reason this is important
is...

320
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:53,555
before my dad left
me and my mom...

321
00:13:53,557 --> 00:13:57,259
he used to... take me
to the comic book store.

322
00:13:58,195 --> 00:14:01,697
It was one of the few things
we did together.

323
00:14:01,699 --> 00:14:04,466
Oh. Howie, I had no idea.

324
00:14:04,468 --> 00:14:07,870
Well, I don't...
like to talk about it.

325
00:14:07,872 --> 00:14:10,572
Oh, baby.

326
00:14:10,574 --> 00:14:14,043
That story's made
up, isn't it?

327
00:14:15,246 --> 00:14:18,814
That's how much buying
a comic book store means to me.

328
00:14:21,786 --> 00:14:24,486
I'd like your honest
opinion on something.

329
00:14:24,488 --> 00:14:25,721
Of course.

330
00:14:25,723 --> 00:14:27,189
Now, before I start,

331
00:14:27,191 --> 00:14:31,193
I need you to know that
I'm very excited about this,

332
00:14:31,195 --> 00:14:33,295
and anything you say

333
00:14:33,297 --> 00:14:35,364
that isn't
enthusiastically supportive

334
00:14:35,366 --> 00:14:39,068
will throw our entire
relationship into question.

335
00:14:41,205 --> 00:14:42,905
So...

336
00:14:42,907 --> 00:14:45,674
keep an open mind.

337
00:14:45,676 --> 00:14:48,777
I'm feeling a little backed
into a corner, Sheldon.

338
00:14:48,779 --> 00:14:50,813
Perfect. Now...

339
00:14:52,083 --> 00:14:54,550
I'm considering investing

340
00:14:54,552 --> 00:14:57,252
in Stuart's comic book store.

341
00:14:58,122 --> 00:14:59,588
Interesting.

342
00:15:01,692 --> 00:15:04,426
Can you see how
a grown man,

343
00:15:04,428 --> 00:15:06,028
an accomplished scientist,

344
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:08,564
who invests in a store

345
00:15:08,566 --> 00:15:10,432
that sells picture books

346
00:15:10,434 --> 00:15:13,836
about flying men in
colorful underwear...

347
00:15:15,106 --> 00:15:17,272
might be wasting
both his financial

348
00:15:17,274 --> 00:15:19,341
and intellectual
resources?

349
00:15:25,983 --> 00:15:28,183
No.

350
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:32,354
Then I think it's
a terrific idea.

351
00:15:32,356 --> 00:15:34,223
Great.

352
00:15:34,225 --> 00:15:38,360
Wait till you hear
about our van.

353
00:15:42,666 --> 00:15:44,600
Hey. Thanks for inviting us over.
Hey.

354
00:15:44,602 --> 00:15:46,034
Oh, thank you
for coming.

355
00:15:46,036 --> 00:15:48,570
Uh, listen, Penny,
before you start,

356
00:15:48,572 --> 00:15:50,539
I just want to apologize
for being so rude

357
00:15:50,541 --> 00:15:51,874
the other day
in my office.

358
00:15:51,876 --> 00:15:53,342
No, no. No need to apologize.

359
00:15:53,344 --> 00:15:55,043
Excuse me,
can I say something?

360
00:15:55,045 --> 00:15:57,179
I just love both you guys,

361
00:15:57,181 --> 00:15:59,148
and I want you
to get along.

362
00:15:59,150 --> 00:16:01,750
And when I say “love"
I meant as a friend.

363
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:05,487
And, uh, way
too soon, right?

364
00:16:06,824 --> 00:16:08,490
Okay, sit down.
Listen, Emily,

365
00:16:08,492 --> 00:16:10,058
what happened
between me and Raj

366
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:11,560
was a long time ago.
It was,

367
00:16:11,562 --> 00:16:12,928
and I may have
made it seem

368
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:14,630
like a bigger deal
than I should have.

369
00:16:14,632 --> 00:16:16,098
Yeah, and Leonard and I
are engaged now,

370
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:18,500
and I'm just hoping we can put
this whole thing behind us.

371
00:16:18,502 --> 00:16:19,968
Mm. I'd like that, too.

372
00:16:19,970 --> 00:16:22,137
Yeah, I thought
I'd be okay with it,

373
00:16:22,139 --> 00:16:24,373
but then I saw
how pretty you are.

374
00:16:24,375 --> 00:16:25,908
Oh, that's so sweet.

375
00:16:25,910 --> 00:16:28,043
I mean, look at you—
you are gorgeous.

376
00:16:28,045 --> 00:16:31,780
It's true—
you're both gorgeous.

377
00:16:31,782 --> 00:16:34,483
Kind of says something about
the man who could bed you both.

378
00:16:40,925 --> 00:16:45,260
You get why I've been alone
most of my adult life.

379
00:16:47,932 --> 00:16:50,666
So, what brings you by?
Well,

380
00:16:50,668 --> 00:16:53,435
I don't need a reason—
it's my house.

381
00:16:53,437 --> 00:16:55,771
Technically,
it's your mom's house, but...

382
00:16:55,773 --> 00:16:58,774
we certainly want you
to feel welcome.

383
00:16:58,776 --> 00:17:01,543
I'm always welcome.

384
00:17:01,545 --> 00:17:04,313
Mm, just... try and call first.

385
00:17:04,315 --> 00:17:07,583
Okay, let's get
down to business.

386
00:17:07,585 --> 00:17:09,952
Howie was thinking about
putting up some money

387
00:17:09,954 --> 00:17:12,921
to help you reopen the store,
but before that happens,

388
00:17:12,923 --> 00:17:14,990
I have a few questions.
Oh.

389
00:17:14,992 --> 00:17:16,358
I appreciate the offer,

390
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:19,494
but actually your mother
already gave me the money.

391
00:17:21,165 --> 00:17:23,465
What?

392
00:17:23,467 --> 00:17:25,601
Yeah. I told her
it was too much,

393
00:17:25,603 --> 00:17:28,770
but she said she was happy
to help out her bubala.

394
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:32,307
Excuse me.

395
00:17:33,277 --> 00:17:35,611
Ma, you are canceling
that check,

396
00:17:35,613 --> 00:17:38,380
and Stuart is not your bubala;
I'm your bubala.

397
00:17:38,382 --> 00:17:41,650
You can't have more
than one bubala!

398
00:17:41,652 --> 00:17:43,385
I don't know
who he's talking to.

399
00:17:43,387 --> 00:17:45,854
She's at Target,
buying me shirts.

400
00:17:48,892 --> 00:17:51,393
I'm so glad we
could work this all out.

401
00:17:51,395 --> 00:17:54,029
Yeah, me, too.
You know, we should have dinner

402
00:17:54,031 --> 00:17:55,397
one night with you and Leonard.

403
00:17:55,399 --> 00:17:56,598
Oh, we would love that.

404
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:57,332
Great!

405
00:17:58,569 --> 00:18:00,636
Okay, good night, guys.
All right, night.

406
00:18:00,638 --> 00:18:02,638
Bye.

407
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:05,207
I hate her.
I hate her.

408
00:18:14,139 --> 00:18:15,705
I'm really disappointed
we're not gonna have

409
00:18:15,707 --> 00:18:17,407
our own comic book store.
I know.

410
00:18:17,409 --> 00:18:19,175
I was looking forward to it.
It would've been

411
00:18:19,177 --> 00:18:21,477
so nice to have a place
that was ours,

412
00:18:21,479 --> 00:18:24,447
where we could just sit
and read comics in peace.

413
00:18:24,449 --> 00:18:25,915
With comfy seats.

414
00:18:25,917 --> 00:18:27,283
And snacks.

415
00:18:27,285 --> 00:18:29,385
Well, I guess
it was too good to be true.

416
00:18:29,387 --> 00:18:30,920
Yeah.

417
