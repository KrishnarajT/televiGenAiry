1
00:00:02,306 --> 00:00:04,907
Leonard, I've been working
on an opening joke

2
00:00:04,909 --> 00:00:06,449
for our lecture at Berkeley.

3
00:00:06,451 --> 00:00:07,620
Oh, I like to laugh.

4
00:00:07,622 --> 00:00:09,125
But say it anyway.

5
00:00:10,128 --> 00:00:12,065
Okay, um...

6
00:00:12,067 --> 00:00:14,732
What do you say
to a graduate

7
00:00:14,734 --> 00:00:17,006
of the UC Berkeley
physics department?

8
00:00:17,008 --> 00:00:19,608
I'll have fries with that.

9
00:00:20,579 --> 00:00:22,586
Because his education
hasn't prepared him

10
00:00:22,588 --> 00:00:24,452
for a career in the sciences.

11
00:00:26,623 --> 00:00:28,293
You know, when they chase
you out of there,

12
00:00:28,295 --> 00:00:29,990
you only have to run
faster than Sheldon.

13
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:32,066
Are you all set
for your trip?

14
00:00:32,068 --> 00:00:33,402
Yeah, I think so.

15
00:00:33,404 --> 00:00:36,637
I just restocked the old PRK.

16
00:00:36,639 --> 00:00:37,678
"PRK"?

17
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:39,174
Public restroom kit.

18
00:00:40,184 --> 00:00:42,917
Everything a boy needs
for making pee pee

19
00:00:42,919 --> 00:00:45,181
in new and strange places.

20
00:00:45,183 --> 00:00:47,621
I don't see what's crazy
about bringing a backpack

21
00:00:47,623 --> 00:00:49,956
with your own toilet paper
and Purell.

22
00:00:49,958 --> 00:00:52,055
Keep going.

23
00:00:52,057 --> 00:00:54,834
And rubber gloves,
uh, air freshener.

24
00:00:54,836 --> 00:00:57,436
Um, noise-cancelling
headphones.

25
00:00:57,438 --> 00:00:59,005
Oh, danger whistle.

26
00:00:59,007 --> 00:01:00,270
Um...

27
00:01:00,272 --> 00:01:01,575
pepper spray.

28
00:01:01,577 --> 00:01:04,545
Ooh, a multi-language
"occupied" sign.

29
00:01:04,547 --> 00:01:05,954
Uh, let's see.

30
00:01:05,956 --> 00:01:09,324
We have seat protectors,
uh, booties for my shoes,

31
00:01:09,326 --> 00:01:11,389
a clothespin for my nose.

32
00:01:11,391 --> 00:01:14,694
Oh, and a mirror on a stick,

33
00:01:14,696 --> 00:01:17,102
so I can make sure the person
in the stall next to me

34
00:01:17,104 --> 00:01:18,935
isn't some kind of weirdo.

35
00:01:21,641 --> 00:01:24,641
You still worried some Berkeley
girl is gonna steal him away?

36
00:01:24,643 --> 00:01:28,252
Yes, who do you think gave him
the danger whistle?

== sync, corrected by elderman ==
@elder_man

47
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:02,788
Would you like to play
a physics car game I invented

48
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:04,757
called "I Can't Spy"?

49
00:02:05,823 --> 00:02:08,092
It's all the nail-biting
tension of "I Spy"

50
00:02:08,094 --> 00:02:11,092
but the added fun of subatomic
particles and waves

51
00:02:11,094 --> 00:02:13,227
outside the visible
spectrum.

52
00:02:13,229 --> 00:02:14,795
If it's half as much fun as

53
00:02:14,797 --> 00:02:16,931
"One Times Ten to the Fourth
Bottles of Beer on the Wall,"

54
00:02:16,933 --> 00:02:18,604
I'm in.

55
00:02:18,606 --> 00:02:20,237
I'll begin.

56
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:24,743
Uh, I can't spy
with my little eye...

57
00:02:25,881 --> 00:02:28,582
something passing
right through us.

58
00:02:28,584 --> 00:02:30,246
That soy Frappuccino I had.

59
00:02:31,384 --> 00:02:33,253
Will you please
play the game?

60
00:02:33,255 --> 00:02:35,853
I can't spy
with my little eye

61
00:02:35,855 --> 00:02:37,885
something passing
right through us.

62
00:02:37,887 --> 00:02:39,957
I don't know, um...

63
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:42,629
If 65 billion
solar neutrinos pass

64
00:02:42,631 --> 00:02:44,693
through a square centimeter
every second,

65
00:02:44,695 --> 00:02:46,734
given the surface
area of this car is

66
00:02:46,736 --> 00:02:48,631
about 60,000
square centimeters,

67
00:02:48,633 --> 00:02:53,377
that means 3.9 times ten
to the 15th solar neutrinos?

68
00:02:55,443 --> 00:02:57,944
I don't want
to play anymore.

69
00:02:58,946 --> 00:03:00,511
We haven't been on a road trip
in a while.

70
00:03:00,513 --> 00:03:01,711
This is fun.

71
00:03:01,713 --> 00:03:03,182
We get it... you won the game.

72
00:03:03,184 --> 00:03:04,983
Stop bragging.

73
00:03:04,985 --> 00:03:07,153
No, listen, we wrote
a paper together.

74
00:03:07,155 --> 00:03:08,889
Now we get to go to a university
and talk about it?

75
00:03:08,891 --> 00:03:10,393
That's pretty cool.

76
00:03:11,259 --> 00:03:13,096
I suppose it is.

77
00:03:13,098 --> 00:03:17,632
In fact, if you'd like to
celebrate with a little music,

78
00:03:17,634 --> 00:03:19,262
I'd be okay with that.

79
00:03:19,264 --> 00:03:22,098
What...?

80
00:03:23,362 --> 00:03:25,565
This road trip just got crazy.

81
00:03:26,525 --> 00:03:28,792
Play that funky music,
white boy.

82
00:03:30,695 --> 00:03:32,724
I'm surprised you know
that reference.

83
00:03:32,726 --> 00:03:35,626
What reference?

84
00:03:38,666 --> 00:03:41,626
So, I put stickers
on everything we're gonna sell.

85
00:03:41,628 --> 00:03:43,488
We just need help taking it
all out to the driveway.

86
00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:44,855
Can I be in charge
of pricing?

87
00:03:44,857 --> 00:03:47,359
I've been going to garage
sales my whole life.

88
00:03:47,361 --> 00:03:49,633
Can you believe I got these
pantyhose for a nickel?

89
00:03:51,236 --> 00:03:54,704
All right, Amy's in charge
of pricing and being 75.

90
00:03:56,273 --> 00:03:57,934
Hey, Penny, can you
give me a hand with this?

91
00:03:57,936 --> 00:03:59,039
Sure.

92
00:03:59,041 --> 00:04:00,639
Aw, we had one of
these growing up.

93
00:04:00,641 --> 00:04:02,110
I used to play
all the time.

94
00:04:02,112 --> 00:04:03,877
Oh, yeah?
I love Ping-Pong.

95
00:04:03,879 --> 00:04:06,107
Oh, I meant beer pong.

96
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:08,844
I had a table, too,

97
00:04:08,846 --> 00:04:11,484
but I didn't have any friends,
so all I did was serve.

98
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:15,159
You know, you can leave one
side up and play against it.

99
00:04:15,161 --> 00:04:18,066
And if I had a friend,
they might have told me that.

100
00:04:20,636 --> 00:04:22,330
Excuse me.

101
00:04:22,332 --> 00:04:24,497
Why is there a sticker on this?

102
00:04:24,499 --> 00:04:26,305
It's my TARDIS
from Doctor Who.

103
00:04:26,307 --> 00:04:28,338
I was planning on
moving it in the house.

104
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:30,611
I think you just answered
your own question.

105
00:04:31,909 --> 00:04:34,579
Come on, one day,
this may double in value

106
00:04:34,581 --> 00:04:37,252
and be worth half
what I paid for it.

107
00:04:37,254 --> 00:04:38,884
Sweetie, we have a lot to do.

108
00:04:38,886 --> 00:04:40,684
We don't need
to decide this right now.

109
00:04:40,686 --> 00:04:43,658
Well, I guess as long as
you're keeping an open mind.

110
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:45,523
Of course.

111
00:04:50,462 --> 00:04:52,732
♪ ♪

112
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:03,483
So... they're requesting

113
00:05:03,485 --> 00:05:06,788
that the white boy play
the funky music, yes?

114
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:08,757
Yes.

115
00:05:08,759 --> 00:05:13,895
And this music we're listening
to right now is funky as well?

116
00:05:15,033 --> 00:05:17,070
Sure.

117
00:05:17,072 --> 00:05:18,733
Let me ask you this.

118
00:05:18,735 --> 00:05:20,204
Do you think

119
00:05:20,206 --> 00:05:24,837
this song is the music
the white boy ultimately plays?

120
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:28,614
It could be.

121
00:05:28,616 --> 00:05:32,180
So it's like the musical
equivalent of Russell's Paradox,

122
00:05:32,182 --> 00:05:34,851
the question of whether
the set of all sets

123
00:05:34,853 --> 00:05:38,080
that don't contain themselves
as members contains itself?

124
00:05:38,082 --> 00:05:40,048
Exactly.
Well...

125
00:05:40,050 --> 00:05:41,351
then I hate it.

126
00:05:41,353 --> 00:05:42,655
Music should just be fun.

127
00:05:45,424 --> 00:05:47,084
Making great time.

128
00:05:47,086 --> 00:05:49,220
Gonna be there pretty early.

129
00:05:49,222 --> 00:05:50,860
Will our hotel room
be ready?

130
00:05:50,862 --> 00:05:52,226
I doubt it.

131
00:05:52,228 --> 00:05:54,825
Aren't you worried
that sitting in the lobby

132
00:05:54,827 --> 00:05:57,360
for a long period of time
might attract the attention

133
00:05:57,362 --> 00:06:00,094
of the hotel detective?

134
00:06:00,096 --> 00:06:01,725
If we do,

135
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:05,395
we'll just tell him
to "hit the bricks, see?"

136
00:06:06,533 --> 00:06:09,774
Seems a little confrontational,
but all right.

137
00:06:11,008 --> 00:06:13,639
You know,
we won't be very far

138
00:06:13,641 --> 00:06:15,048
from Skywalker Ranch.

139
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:16,912
Oh, that's true.

140
00:06:16,914 --> 00:06:18,816
It's not like
we can get in there.

141
00:06:18,818 --> 00:06:20,848
Why not?

142
00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:22,857
I-I don't think George Lucas
put his headquarters

143
00:06:22,859 --> 00:06:25,923
in the middle of nowhere because
he wanted people dropping in.

144
00:06:25,925 --> 00:06:30,194
Yoda's swamp was
in the middle of nowhere.

145
00:06:30,196 --> 00:06:32,362
Tatooine was in the middle
of nowhere.

146
00:06:32,364 --> 00:06:34,570
Hoth was in the middle
of nowhere.

147
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:37,539
That's code, Leonard.

148
00:06:37,541 --> 00:06:39,740
He wants us
to drop in.

149
00:06:42,279 --> 00:06:43,508
We do have time.

150
00:06:43,510 --> 00:06:46,411
I mean, we could drive by
and just look at it.

151
00:06:46,413 --> 00:06:48,545
Yes! Oh...

152
00:06:48,547 --> 00:06:50,185
I'm so excited.

153
00:06:50,187 --> 00:06:52,584
And I just can't hide it.

154
00:06:52,586 --> 00:06:56,459
"I'm about to lose control,
and I think I like it."

155
00:06:58,398 --> 00:07:00,397
What are you
talking about?

156
00:07:06,104 --> 00:07:08,343
So when do you guys think
you're gonna move in?

157
00:07:08,345 --> 00:07:11,280
We're still figuring how much
remodeling we want to do.

158
00:07:11,282 --> 00:07:13,313
It's tricky finding
the right balance

159
00:07:13,315 --> 00:07:14,417
between "tasteful modern"

160
00:07:14,419 --> 00:07:17,280
and "Jewish mother
tchotchke crapfest."

161
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:20,656
Have you made a decision
about the TARDIS?

162
00:07:20,658 --> 00:07:23,855
I think I can sell it if we call
it, "Big British Porta-Potty."

163
00:07:26,025 --> 00:07:28,894
We're not selling
it... it's mine.

164
00:07:28,896 --> 00:07:30,526
You can't just decide.

165
00:07:30,528 --> 00:07:32,365
How about I arm-wrestle you?

166
00:07:32,367 --> 00:07:33,733
That's not fair.

167
00:07:33,735 --> 00:07:37,637
It's like me challenging you
to a sexy pants contest.

168
00:07:39,038 --> 00:07:40,333
You could play
Ping-Pong for it.

169
00:07:40,335 --> 00:07:41,942
I would do that.

170
00:07:41,944 --> 00:07:42,871
How is that fair?

171
00:07:42,873 --> 00:07:44,176
You grew up
with a table.

172
00:07:44,178 --> 00:07:46,648
Yes, but I mostly used it
as a battlefield

173
00:07:46,650 --> 00:07:49,446
in an ongoing war between the
Transformers and the ThunderCats

174
00:07:49,448 --> 00:07:52,046
for control of a bra
I had found in the woods.

175
00:07:54,521 --> 00:07:56,192
Bernadette, for every episode
of Doctor Who

176
00:07:56,194 --> 00:07:57,520
Leonard has made me sit through,

177
00:07:57,522 --> 00:07:58,792
I will play on your behalf

178
00:07:58,794 --> 00:08:00,824
and send that TARDIS
back to Gallifrey,

179
00:08:00,826 --> 00:08:02,792
where I hate
that I know it belongs.

180
00:08:02,794 --> 00:08:05,398
Yes, Penny
plays for me.

181
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:08,396
That's not fair...
she has upper body muscles.

182
00:08:09,966 --> 00:08:12,571
Dude, three-time
Sanskriti School

183
00:08:12,573 --> 00:08:15,506
for Well-Born Boys
badminton champion.

184
00:08:16,403 --> 00:08:18,304
That's right... okay,
Raj can play for me.

185
00:08:18,306 --> 00:08:20,040
Ooh, you just chose champions.

186
00:08:20,042 --> 00:08:22,007
It's like we're reenacting
the ancient German practice

187
00:08:22,009 --> 00:08:23,911
- of trial by combat.
- Yeah, it's also like

188
00:08:23,913 --> 00:08:26,280
when the Mountain fought the
Red Viper in Game of Thrones.

189
00:08:26,282 --> 00:08:28,048
Leonard makes you
watch that, too?

190
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:29,584
No, no, I like that show.

191
00:08:29,586 --> 00:08:31,416
It's got dragons
and people doing it.

192
00:08:32,353 --> 00:08:33,718
So it's settled.

193
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:36,287
The fate of Doctor Who's TARDIS
will be decided

194
00:08:36,289 --> 00:08:38,822
by a Game of Thrones inspired
death-match on the battlefield

195
00:08:38,824 --> 00:08:41,926
of ThunderCats
versus Transformers.

196
00:08:41,928 --> 00:08:45,230
If you still have that bra,
I'll give you a nickel for it.

197
00:08:50,936 --> 00:08:54,298
There it is.

198
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:57,273
It's just a gate.

199
00:08:57,275 --> 00:09:00,271
On a road.

200
00:09:00,273 --> 00:09:02,439
Wasn't even that
hard to find.

201
00:09:05,313 --> 00:09:06,607
This is so amazing!

202
00:09:06,609 --> 00:09:08,479
I know!

203
00:09:09,513 --> 00:09:11,047
You want to
get a picture?

204
00:09:11,049 --> 00:09:12,582
I want more than a picture.

205
00:09:12,584 --> 00:09:13,846
I want to go in.

206
00:09:13,848 --> 00:09:15,550
Well, so do I, but
they'll never let us.

207
00:09:15,552 --> 00:09:19,022
Is that the attitude
that helped you get Penny?

208
00:09:19,024 --> 00:09:20,893
No, but I don't have three years

209
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:23,228
to make that gate
feel sorry for me.

210
00:09:25,095 --> 00:09:27,092
Uh, there's
a speaker box.

211
00:09:27,094 --> 00:09:30,596
Drive up, push the button,
and let's see what happens.

212
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:33,067
Okay, yeah.

213
00:09:33,069 --> 00:09:35,698
What do we
have to lose?

214
00:09:43,510 --> 00:09:45,114
I'm a little nervous.

215
00:09:45,116 --> 00:09:47,747
Well, get over it.

216
00:09:47,749 --> 00:09:50,420
Confidence is key
in these situations.

217
00:09:50,422 --> 00:09:52,285
Right.

218
00:09:53,424 --> 00:09:55,960
You pushed it...
are you out of your mind?

219
00:09:57,299 --> 00:09:58,465
May I help you?

220
00:09:58,467 --> 00:09:59,529
Um...

221
00:09:59,531 --> 00:10:01,738
Uh, uh... we don't
have an appointment,

222
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:02,971
and-and we don't
belong here,

223
00:10:02,973 --> 00:10:05,275
but we-we're, like,
crazy-big fans.

224
00:10:05,277 --> 00:10:06,842
I mean...

225
00:10:06,844 --> 00:10:08,977
"crazy for Star
Wars" crazy,

226
00:10:08,979 --> 00:10:11,944
not crazy like we have a
backpack full of duct tape,

227
00:10:11,946 --> 00:10:13,343
although we do
have a backpack

228
00:10:13,345 --> 00:10:15,542
that you really don't
want to look in.

229
00:10:18,417 --> 00:10:19,688
You're blowing it.

230
00:10:19,690 --> 00:10:21,352
We want to meet
George Lucas

231
00:10:21,354 --> 00:10:23,886
and become his friends
and play with him!

232
00:10:26,294 --> 00:10:27,588
Hello?

233
00:10:27,590 --> 00:10:29,493
This speaker's not working,
just pull up.

234
00:10:34,231 --> 00:10:36,133
And that's how it's done.

235
00:10:48,090 --> 00:10:52,189
All right, we've defeated
the first challenge.

236
00:10:53,559 --> 00:10:56,261
Now we must steel ourselves
to face the monster

237
00:10:56,263 --> 00:10:58,525
who defends the gate.

238
00:10:58,527 --> 00:11:01,093
We're trying to get past
a security guard,

239
00:11:01,095 --> 00:11:02,964
not rescue Zelda.

240
00:11:04,468 --> 00:11:07,169
I think what really needs to be
rescued is your sense of whimsy,

241
00:11:07,171 --> 00:11:09,169
but one quest at a time.

242
00:11:11,107 --> 00:11:12,840
So what's the plan?

243
00:11:12,842 --> 00:11:15,136
Uh, I'm just gonna be honest
with the guy.

244
00:11:15,138 --> 00:11:17,511
Honesty will never
get us in.

245
00:11:17,513 --> 00:11:19,144
Well, what's
your plan?

246
00:11:19,146 --> 00:11:22,514
All right, my plan is
predicated on the assumption

247
00:11:22,516 --> 00:11:24,482
that they have
a nurse's office

248
00:11:24,484 --> 00:11:27,354
and your willingness
to be lightly stabbed.

249
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:36,795
Who are you here to see?

250
00:11:36,797 --> 00:11:38,364
Uh, I'm just gonna
tell you the truth.

251
00:11:38,366 --> 00:11:40,900
Oh, you are killing me.

252
00:11:40,902 --> 00:11:42,940
We don't have
an appointment.

253
00:11:42,942 --> 00:11:44,940
We-we're just fans
of Mr. Lucas's work,

254
00:11:44,942 --> 00:11:46,205
and we thought
we'd take a shot

255
00:11:46,207 --> 00:11:48,244
and see if we could get in
and look around.

256
00:11:48,246 --> 00:11:49,676
Sorry, guys, we get this a lot.

257
00:11:49,678 --> 00:11:50,779
Can't let you in.

258
00:11:50,781 --> 00:11:54,679
What if I told you
that I was the voice of Yoda?

259
00:11:55,785 --> 00:11:59,885
A recording
session I must attend.

260
00:12:00,687 --> 00:12:02,578
I'm sorry, don't
listen to him.

261
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:04,282
We're actually
physicists.

262
00:12:04,284 --> 00:12:06,184
We're giving a lecture
at Berkeley later today.

263
00:12:06,186 --> 00:12:08,184
We just... we had
some time to kill.

264
00:12:08,186 --> 00:12:10,455
Hey, listen, you
seem like decent guys.

265
00:12:10,457 --> 00:12:11,750
I can't let you in,

266
00:12:11,752 --> 00:12:14,285
but I got some hats and T-shirts
I can give you.

267
00:12:14,287 --> 00:12:16,156
Thank you so much.

268
00:12:16,158 --> 00:12:17,724
See?

269
00:12:17,726 --> 00:12:19,029
Maybe honesty is the best...

270
00:12:19,031 --> 00:12:20,029
What are you doing?

271
00:12:20,031 --> 00:12:21,692
Shedding the yoke
of my oppressors,

272
00:12:21,694 --> 00:12:23,900
you blind,
sad little man.

273
00:12:24,733 --> 00:12:26,068
Don't move!

274
00:12:26,070 --> 00:12:28,100
Code A-A-23, A-A-23.

275
00:12:28,102 --> 00:12:29,468
Copy.

276
00:12:29,470 --> 00:12:31,603
I can see the ranch, Leonard!

277
00:12:31,605 --> 00:12:34,170
Oh, it's rustic,
it's lovely.

278
00:12:34,172 --> 00:12:37,009
I'd take a picture,
but people are chasing me.

279
00:12:38,547 --> 00:12:39,872
I'm gonna make it...!

280
00:12:39,874 --> 00:12:41,175
I'm gonna make it!

281
00:12:41,177 --> 00:12:43,509
They have Tasers,
but they wouldn't dare use...

282
00:12:47,549 --> 00:12:50,011
Come on, Raj.

283
00:12:50,013 --> 00:12:53,715
You are the King Kong
of Ping-Pong.

284
00:12:53,717 --> 00:12:57,489
You are the menace
of table tennis.

285
00:12:57,491 --> 00:13:00,591
Put her away,
'cause I don't have a third one.

286
00:13:00,593 --> 00:13:02,358
Yes!
Yes!

287
00:13:03,328 --> 00:13:05,822
Rajesh eight, Penny four.

288
00:13:05,824 --> 00:13:07,792
Sorry,
he's really good.

289
00:13:07,794 --> 00:13:09,925
Hey, Raj.

290
00:13:09,927 --> 00:13:11,094
if Howard can't
keep the TARDIS,

291
00:13:11,096 --> 00:13:12,796
how great would it
look at your place?

292
00:13:12,798 --> 00:13:13,827
What?

293
00:13:13,829 --> 00:13:15,266
Yeah, what?

294
00:13:15,268 --> 00:13:17,694
I don't know much
about Doctor Who,

295
00:13:17,696 --> 00:13:19,594
but if, um, you were to put this

296
00:13:19,596 --> 00:13:23,627
right outside your front door
and open up the back,

297
00:13:23,629 --> 00:13:26,656
it would be like
your entire apartment was

298
00:13:26,658 --> 00:13:28,423
the inside of the TARDIS,

299
00:13:28,425 --> 00:13:30,159
which is pretty cool

300
00:13:30,161 --> 00:13:32,491
'cause on the show,
the inside of the TARDIS

301
00:13:32,493 --> 00:13:35,425
is bigger than the outside.

302
00:13:35,427 --> 00:13:39,349
But then again, I don't know
much about Doctor Who.

303
00:13:40,518 --> 00:13:42,187
Don't listen to her.

304
00:13:42,189 --> 00:13:44,922
You and I go way back...
we're like brothers.

305
00:13:45,755 --> 00:13:47,425
We are. We are.

306
00:13:48,722 --> 00:13:50,656
Oh, no!

307
00:13:50,658 --> 00:13:52,055
What a terrible serve!

308
00:13:54,131 --> 00:13:55,597
Sorry, brother.

309
00:13:55,599 --> 00:13:56,962
Eight-five.
This is ridiculous.

310
00:13:56,964 --> 00:13:58,224
I want a new champion.

311
00:13:58,226 --> 00:14:00,989
Amy, were you serious
about being able to serve?

312
00:14:00,991 --> 00:14:03,323
Uh, it-it's been
a long time.

313
00:14:03,325 --> 00:14:05,290
I don't know.

314
00:14:05,292 --> 00:14:07,227
I'm probably
pretty rusty.

315
00:14:10,732 --> 00:14:12,034
Wow.

316
00:14:12,036 --> 00:14:13,066
She's my champion!

317
00:14:13,068 --> 00:14:15,105
Well, if you can switch
champions, so can I.

318
00:14:15,107 --> 00:14:16,506
I want Raj.
Hey.

319
00:14:16,508 --> 00:14:18,370
Oh, come on, like
you even care.

320
00:14:18,372 --> 00:14:19,707
I care!

321
00:14:19,709 --> 00:14:21,547
Oh, wait, no, I don't.
Good luck, Raj.

322
00:14:24,046 --> 00:14:26,126
You know, I thought our
friendship meant more to you.

323
00:14:26,854 --> 00:14:28,515
So did I.

324
00:14:36,257 --> 00:14:38,526
Do you think
they're gonna call the police?

325
00:14:38,528 --> 00:14:40,455
I don't know.

326
00:14:40,457 --> 00:14:42,758
Maybe they'll call Imperial
Officers to take us

327
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:45,030
to a holding cell
on the Death Star.

328
00:14:47,832 --> 00:14:51,134
Oh, I think that's below the pay
grade of an Imperial Officer.

329
00:14:51,136 --> 00:14:52,501
Stormtroopers are really
the ones who...

330
00:14:52,503 --> 00:14:54,133
Oh, shut up.

331
00:14:55,142 --> 00:14:56,940
He's right.

332
00:14:56,942 --> 00:14:59,044
Uh, Stormtroopers actually
combine both the function

333
00:14:59,046 --> 00:15:01,210
of infantry and military police.

334
00:15:03,410 --> 00:15:05,407
Uh-huh, I'm normally
very nice,

335
00:15:05,409 --> 00:15:07,142
but you shut up, too.

336
00:15:13,886 --> 00:15:15,379
So...

337
00:15:15,381 --> 00:15:18,186
what are you in for?

338
00:15:18,188 --> 00:15:21,856
Honestly, I just wanted to meet
Mr. Lucas and say thank you.

339
00:15:21,858 --> 00:15:25,352
You know, growing up, the movies
had such an impact on my life.

340
00:15:25,354 --> 00:15:27,657
I never really fit in anywhere.

341
00:15:27,659 --> 00:15:29,697
Till I discovered
the worlds he created

342
00:15:29,699 --> 00:15:32,495
and finally found a place
where I belong.

343
00:15:33,696 --> 00:15:35,797
But why are you here?

344
00:15:35,799 --> 00:15:37,429
Oh, I, uh, I hopped a fence,

345
00:15:37,431 --> 00:15:39,100
and they caught me
in the sculpture gallery

346
00:15:39,102 --> 00:15:41,866
making out
with a Chewbacca statue.

347
00:15:47,933 --> 00:15:49,465
Excuse me.

348
00:15:57,738 --> 00:15:59,640
Leonard,

349
00:15:59,642 --> 00:16:01,911
they have a
sculpture gallery.

350
00:16:06,015 --> 00:16:08,277
All right, I talked
to my supervisor,

351
00:16:08,279 --> 00:16:09,485
and we're gonna let you go
with a warning.

352
00:16:09,487 --> 00:16:11,286
But if you ever
come back,

353
00:16:11,288 --> 00:16:12,950
we will call the police
and press charges.

354
00:16:12,952 --> 00:16:13,950
We understand.

355
00:16:13,952 --> 00:16:14,918
Thank you so much.

356
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:16,525
Uh, what about me?

357
00:16:16,527 --> 00:16:17,956
No, you're not going
anywhere, kissy face.

358
00:16:17,958 --> 00:16:19,524
Let's go.

359
00:16:19,526 --> 00:16:22,627
I have to take your picture
to post at the guard gate.

360
00:16:22,629 --> 00:16:23,595
Uh, one question

361
00:16:23,597 --> 00:16:25,090
about that picture.

362
00:16:25,092 --> 00:16:26,897
Can it be with
George Lucas?

363
00:16:28,563 --> 00:16:30,697
Ooh, grumpy you are.

364
00:16:35,641 --> 00:16:38,672
Okay, this is the match
that decides it all.

365
00:16:38,674 --> 00:16:39,945
First to 11 wins.

366
00:16:39,947 --> 00:16:42,776
Serve switches
every five points.

367
00:16:42,778 --> 00:16:44,313
And just so you know,
when this started,

368
00:16:44,315 --> 00:16:47,082
I was going to put the TARDIS in
a discreet corner of the house,

369
00:16:47,084 --> 00:16:48,618
but I've since turned
mean, and now it's going

370
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:50,121
right in the middle
of the living room

371
00:16:50,123 --> 00:16:51,888
on a rotating platform with
a sign that says "suck it."

372
00:16:51,890 --> 00:16:53,056
Game on.

373
00:16:55,457 --> 00:16:56,759
Except...

374
00:16:56,761 --> 00:16:59,127
Raj is gonna win.

375
00:16:59,129 --> 00:17:00,422
Isn't that right, Raj?

376
00:17:00,424 --> 00:17:02,892
Uh, yeah, I mean,
her serve was pretty good.

377
00:17:02,894 --> 00:17:04,426
Come on, get
in her head.

378
00:17:04,428 --> 00:17:05,592
Be intimidating.

379
00:17:05,594 --> 00:17:07,624
Okay, uh...

380
00:17:07,626 --> 00:17:08,791
I'm gonna own you, bitch!

381
00:17:08,793 --> 00:17:10,462
Whoa!
Hey!

382
00:17:10,464 --> 00:17:11,966
That's not nice.

383
00:17:13,232 --> 00:17:14,870
Let's just play.

384
00:17:18,872 --> 00:17:20,174
One-zero.

385
00:17:20,176 --> 00:17:21,742
Two.

386
00:17:21,744 --> 00:17:23,407
Three.

387
00:17:23,409 --> 00:17:25,277
Four.

388
00:17:25,279 --> 00:17:27,077
Five-nothing.

389
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:28,477
Wait,

390
00:17:28,479 --> 00:17:29,813
did you play badminton

391
00:17:29,815 --> 00:17:32,453
or sad-minton?

392
00:17:32,455 --> 00:17:34,452
Don't listen to him...
all she's got is a serve.

393
00:17:34,454 --> 00:17:37,924
Now, grab a fresh tampon
and put her away.

394
00:17:37,926 --> 00:17:38,924
Wha...?

395
00:17:38,926 --> 00:17:40,422
A-And that's not offensive?

396
00:17:40,424 --> 00:17:41,464
Where's the line?

397
00:17:41,466 --> 00:17:43,600
It's in your purse. Play.

398
00:17:45,803 --> 00:17:47,506
One-five.

399
00:17:48,972 --> 00:17:50,474
Two-five.

400
00:17:50,476 --> 00:17:51,609
Three-five.

401
00:17:51,611 --> 00:17:53,272
Four-five.

402
00:17:54,242 --> 00:17:55,471
Five-five!

403
00:17:57,145 --> 00:17:58,744
Six.

404
00:17:58,746 --> 00:18:00,048
Seven.

405
00:18:00,050 --> 00:18:01,912
Eight. Nine.

406
00:18:02,482 --> 00:18:04,984
Ten-five!

407
00:18:06,291 --> 00:18:08,426
Six.

408
00:18:10,564 --> 00:18:12,331
Seven.

409
00:18:12,333 --> 00:18:14,035
Eight.

410
00:18:14,037 --> 00:18:16,002
Nine.

411
00:18:16,004 --> 00:18:19,033
Ten-ten!

412
00:18:21,403 --> 00:18:23,967
Well, that was
an exciting 40 seconds.

413
00:18:25,105 --> 00:18:27,374
It was, and now
the serve is back to you,

414
00:18:27,376 --> 00:18:29,142
and the game is over.

415
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:33,382
You know, Amy,
I, uh...

416
00:18:33,384 --> 00:18:35,350
can't help but wonder
how Sheldon would react

417
00:18:35,352 --> 00:18:37,550
if the TARDIS was
at your place.

418
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:40,551
Don't listen to her,
just hit the ball.

419
00:18:41,393 --> 00:18:42,920
Keep talking.

420
00:18:46,666 --> 00:18:49,496
If this doesn't get him
into your bedroom,

421
00:18:49,498 --> 00:18:51,168
nothing will.

422
00:18:57,578 --> 00:18:59,040
Are you still
mad at me?

423
00:18:59,042 --> 00:19:02,715
Yes, we missed our lecture,
we were almost arrested,

424
00:19:02,717 --> 00:19:04,716
and you got me locked
in a room with a man

425
00:19:04,718 --> 00:19:09,220
who forced his tongue down the
throat of a stuffed Wookiee.

426
00:19:10,325 --> 00:19:12,587
Boy, some people are just
glass-half-empty.

427
00:19:13,358 --> 00:19:15,124
The glass is
empty, Sheldon.

428
00:19:15,126 --> 00:19:16,364
It's completely empty.

429
00:19:16,366 --> 00:19:18,363
If you gave that glass to a
man who was dying of thirst,

430
00:19:18,365 --> 00:19:20,395
he would be dead,
do you know why?

431
00:19:20,397 --> 00:19:23,499
Before I answer,
was he a smoker?

432
00:19:28,243 --> 00:19:30,273
I think you're looking
at this all wrong.

433
00:19:30,275 --> 00:19:32,872
Fine, then tell me
how I should be looking at it.

434
00:19:32,874 --> 00:19:37,176
Well, not only did we go to
Skywalker Ranch, we got in.

435
00:19:37,178 --> 00:19:39,479
No one we know
can say that.

436
00:19:39,481 --> 00:19:42,816
And for all the times
you find me irritating,

437
00:19:42,818 --> 00:19:46,090
today you got to watch
someone shoot me with a Taser.

438
00:19:49,333 --> 00:19:52,065
That part was pretty good.

439
00:19:52,067 --> 00:19:53,760
See?

440
00:19:53,762 --> 00:19:56,735
You did flop around a lot.

441
00:19:56,737 --> 00:19:59,001
I'll take your word for it.

442
00:19:59,003 --> 00:20:02,107
I was too busy
trying not to defecate.

443
00:20:03,942 --> 00:20:06,276
You know, when they were
escorting us

444
00:20:06,278 --> 00:20:09,515
to the detaining room,
I looked through a door,

445
00:20:09,517 --> 00:20:11,483
and I'm pretty sure
I saw a display case

446
00:20:11,485 --> 00:20:13,418
with the Ark
of the Covenant.

447
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:15,753
That's amazing.
I know.

448
00:20:15,755 --> 00:20:19,025
And I saw Jabba the Hutt
riding by on a motorcycle.

449
00:20:19,027 --> 00:20:21,425
Although that was
right after the Tasing,

450
00:20:21,427 --> 00:20:23,498
so who can
say for sure?

451
00:20:24,996 --> 00:20:27,760
I-I guess this could count
as an adventure.

452
00:20:27,762 --> 00:20:29,032
It was.

453
00:20:29,034 --> 00:20:31,663
And even though we're
not allowed back there,

454
00:20:31,665 --> 00:20:33,968
they can never take
today away from us.

455
00:20:34,674 --> 00:20:36,702
Unlike my sense
of smell,

456
00:20:36,704 --> 00:20:39,269
which hasn't returned
since the Tasing.

457
00:20:41,909 --> 00:20:43,443
No, I got nothing.

458
00:20:52,565 --> 00:20:55,930
Amy, the Daleks
are right on my tail!

459
00:20:55,932 --> 00:20:58,267
Quick, we need to reset
the time circuits.

460
00:20:58,269 --> 00:21:01,436
Oh, no, I left my sonic
screwdriver behind.

461
00:21:06,168 --> 00:21:07,728
Really should have
thought this through.

462
