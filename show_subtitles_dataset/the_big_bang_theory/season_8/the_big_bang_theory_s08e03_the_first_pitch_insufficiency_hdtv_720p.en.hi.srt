1
00:00:03,675 --> 00:00:05,168
So, how does this game work?

2
00:00:05,168 --> 00:00:06,801
I just throw it,
like a real ball?

3
00:00:06,803 --> 00:00:09,320
Yeah, just nice and easy,
right over the plate.

4
00:00:09,322 --> 00:00:11,222
All right.

5
00:00:11,224 --> 00:00:13,708
You suck, Wolowitz!

6
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:15,577
What's that about?

7
00:00:15,579 --> 00:00:16,745
I'm heckling you.

8
00:00:16,747 --> 00:00:18,296
It's a beloved part
of baseball.

9
00:00:18,298 --> 00:00:20,081
He's right.

10
00:00:20,083 --> 00:00:21,499
And given that you're
probably still waiting

11
00:00:21,501 --> 00:00:23,451
to be picked for a game that
was played in fifth grade,

12
00:00:23,453 --> 00:00:25,537
I'm sure you do suck.

13
00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:28,039
Hi. What's going on?

14
00:00:28,041 --> 00:00:29,124
Baseball.

15
00:00:29,126 --> 00:00:31,126
Okay, this is not
what I meant when I said

16
00:00:31,128 --> 00:00:32,410
go outside and play.

17
00:00:32,412 --> 00:00:34,295
He's practicing.

18
00:00:34,297 --> 00:00:35,263
For what?

19
00:00:35,265 --> 00:00:37,632
The Angels wanted an astronaut

20
00:00:37,634 --> 00:00:39,184
to throw out the first pitch,

21
00:00:39,186 --> 00:00:40,969
so guess who they called?

22
00:00:40,971 --> 00:00:42,504
What, you? Really?

23
00:00:42,506 --> 00:00:45,974
Well, a lot of people who
weren't available, but then me!

24
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:48,226
That's so cool!

25
00:00:48,228 --> 00:00:49,394
Congratulations.

26
00:00:49,396 --> 00:00:51,529
I guess that makes you
the athlete of the group.

27
00:00:51,531 --> 00:00:53,481
Well, not just him!

28
00:00:53,483 --> 00:00:56,117
May I remind you that you're
talking to the seeker, beater,

29
00:00:56,119 --> 00:00:58,153
chaser and water boy

30
00:00:58,155 --> 00:01:01,322
of the third place
Griffith Park Quidditch team.

31
00:01:01,324 --> 00:01:02,490
I know.

32
00:01:02,492 --> 00:01:04,159
Watching your boyfriend
run around with a broomstick

33
00:01:04,161 --> 00:01:06,611
between his legs
isn't something you forget.

34
00:01:07,747 --> 00:01:08,880
C'mon now,
throw one.

35
00:01:08,882 --> 00:01:11,249
All right,
here we go.

36
00:01:11,251 --> 00:01:13,501
You look like a jackass!

37
00:01:13,503 --> 00:01:15,553
Cut it out!
You're hurting my feelings!

38
00:01:15,555 --> 00:01:18,423

The First Pitch Insufficiency
Original Air Date on Septem

00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:48,050
== sync, corrected by elderman ==
@elder_man

49
00:01:48,051 --> 00:01:50,116
Did you enjoy
my lecture?

50
00:01:50,117 --> 00:01:52,534
No, and neither did
our waiter.

51
00:01:54,205 --> 00:01:56,705
Well, if you're going to
serve Cornish game hen,

52
00:01:56,707 --> 00:01:59,291
you should either be familiar
with the history of Cornwall

53
00:01:59,293 --> 00:02:00,743
or be prepared
to learn it.

54
00:02:02,213 --> 00:02:03,495
It's hard to argue with that.

55
00:02:03,497 --> 00:02:06,298
And I know because I saw a
sad man with a pepper mill

56
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:08,417
desperately try and fail.

57
00:02:13,424 --> 00:02:14,556
Hey, how was dinner?

58
00:02:14,558 --> 00:02:16,975
Good, I had Cornish game hen.

59
00:02:16,977 --> 00:02:19,561
Oh, that poor waiter.

60
00:02:21,182 --> 00:02:23,349
Sheldon, how about tomorrow
night we see a movie?

61
00:02:23,351 --> 00:02:25,184
You guys are going out
two nights in a row?

62
00:02:25,186 --> 00:02:29,154
I missed a number of date nights
while I was on my train trip,

63
00:02:29,156 --> 00:02:31,357
and I'm contractually
obligated to make them up

64
00:02:31,359 --> 00:02:33,826
under the terms of the
Relationship Agreement.

65
00:02:34,695 --> 00:02:36,895
That's so hot.

66
00:02:36,897 --> 00:02:40,115
It's better than hot,
it's binding.

67
00:02:41,769 --> 00:02:43,836
If you're free
tomorrow night,

68
00:02:43,838 --> 00:02:46,121
I'd love to have you
join us on a double date.

69
00:02:46,123 --> 00:02:47,523
Aw...

70
00:02:47,525 --> 00:02:51,677
You are aware that a double date
doesn't count as two dates.

71
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:54,680
Oh.

72
00:02:54,682 --> 00:02:55,931
Well, then come
or don't.

73
00:02:55,933 --> 00:02:57,132
I don't care.

74
00:03:00,938 --> 00:03:03,806
I can't believe you're sore.

75
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:07,192
Hey, even professional pitchers
need a rubdown after the game.

76
00:03:08,729 --> 00:03:10,446
But they throw
an actual ball.

77
00:03:10,448 --> 00:03:13,365
You were throwing
air at a TV.

78
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:16,034
For your information,

79
00:03:16,036 --> 00:03:19,204
I also gave Leonard
one hell of a high five.

80
00:03:19,206 --> 00:03:21,407
I'm kind of surprised
you agreed to do this

81
00:03:21,409 --> 00:03:23,292
in front of a stadium
full of people.

82
00:03:23,294 --> 00:03:25,794
They're doing Space Day
and NASA asked me.

83
00:03:25,796 --> 00:03:27,246
I felt like I couldn't say no.

84
00:03:27,248 --> 00:03:28,414
Okay.

85
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:30,249
Well, if you want,
I could help you practice.

86
00:03:30,251 --> 00:03:31,917
I played a lot of softball
growing up.

87
00:03:31,919 --> 00:03:34,219
Thank you, that
would be great.

88
00:03:34,221 --> 00:03:35,504
Great.
And while we're at it,

89
00:03:35,506 --> 00:03:36,755
maybe we could butch up your run

90
00:03:36,757 --> 00:03:38,340
for when you head out
to the mound.

91
00:03:39,727 --> 00:03:41,643
What's wrong with the way I run?

92
00:03:41,645 --> 00:03:42,728
Oh, just kidding.

93
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:43,929
Nothing.

94
00:03:52,106 --> 00:03:55,491
Sheldon, I'm surprised
you'd choose to go to a pub.

95
00:03:55,493 --> 00:03:57,192
At our committee meeting,

96
00:03:57,194 --> 00:03:59,745
Amy made a motion
for a picnic in a park,

97
00:03:59,747 --> 00:04:02,080
but I tacked so many amendments
on that thing

98
00:04:02,082 --> 00:04:04,416
it sank like a lead balloon.

99
00:04:04,418 --> 00:04:06,502
I then suggested a pub.

100
00:04:06,504 --> 00:04:08,787
Yeah, which I was
initially skeptical of until

101
00:04:08,789 --> 00:04:11,840
I saw online that they serve
Yorkshire pudding.

102
00:04:11,842 --> 00:04:13,959
You don't even like
Yorkshire pudding.

103
00:04:13,961 --> 00:04:15,093
No, it's yucky,

104
00:04:15,095 --> 00:04:17,796
but informing people about
the history of Yorkshire

105
00:04:17,798 --> 00:04:19,765
is yummy, yum-yum.

106
00:04:19,767 --> 00:04:22,468
After a lively debate,

107
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:25,554
that proposal passed
by a two-zero margin.

108
00:04:25,556 --> 00:04:27,773
Nice to see a busy couple

109
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:28,974
keep the spark
of bureaucracy alive.

110
00:04:31,729 --> 00:04:34,146
Ignore them, Amy.
They're just jealous

111
00:04:34,148 --> 00:04:37,316
because they'll never have
a relationship as good as ours.

112
00:04:38,736 --> 00:04:42,371
Isn't this when he says
“bazooka” or something?

113
00:04:42,373 --> 00:04:44,072
I wasn't
making a joke,

114
00:04:44,074 --> 00:04:46,041
I was merely
stating fact.

115
00:04:46,043 --> 00:04:49,912
Amy and I have a superior
relationship to yours.

116
00:04:49,914 --> 00:04:52,247
You don't honestly
think that, do you?

117
00:04:52,249 --> 00:04:53,882
Y... Leonard,

118
00:04:53,884 --> 00:04:56,218
I assumed you knew.

119
00:04:57,221 --> 00:04:59,054
The ranking of
relationships in our circle

120
00:04:59,056 --> 00:05:01,390
by quality is:
me and Amy,

121
00:05:01,392 --> 00:05:04,226
Howard and Bernadette,
Raj and his girlfriend,

122
00:05:04,228 --> 00:05:07,062
Penny and Chardonnay,
Penny and you.

123
00:05:09,683 --> 00:05:11,650
There isn't any ranking.

124
00:05:11,652 --> 00:05:14,653
And if there were, we wouldn't
be at the bottom of it.

125
00:05:14,655 --> 00:05:17,489
Yeah, and actually,
I drink Sauvignon Blanc.

126
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,360
That's the part
you have a problem with?

127
00:05:21,362 --> 00:05:23,278
Relax.

128
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:26,198
There they go,
fighting again.

129
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:29,034
You'd never hear her talk
that way to Sauvignon Blanc.

130
00:05:32,339 --> 00:05:34,623
So you never played
baseball as a kid,

131
00:05:34,625 --> 00:05:36,458
not even
Little League?

132
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:38,544
Well, I was going to,
but the day of tryouts

133
00:05:38,546 --> 00:05:40,879
I found my dad's
Playboy collection.

134
00:05:42,933 --> 00:05:45,133
Threw my arm out.

135
00:05:47,221 --> 00:05:49,054
All right, the pitcher's mound
in Major League Baseball

136
00:05:49,056 --> 00:05:51,473
is 60 feet, six inches
away from home plate.

137
00:05:51,475 --> 00:05:53,642
Great. You take this

138
00:05:53,644 --> 00:05:55,811
and say when to stop

139
00:06:01,619 --> 00:06:02,951
How much further?

140
00:06:02,953 --> 00:06:04,953
Keep going.

141
00:06:06,657 --> 00:06:07,906
How about now?

142
00:06:07,908 --> 00:06:10,659
I'll let you know.

143
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:15,998
Are you saying “stop” and we're
just too far away to hear you?

144
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,083
Okay, stop.

145
00:06:21,939 --> 00:06:24,239
Are you kidding me?

146
00:06:24,241 --> 00:06:25,691
That's 60 feet.

147
00:06:25,693 --> 00:06:28,327
There's no way
this is 60 feet.

148
00:06:28,329 --> 00:06:30,762
I'm looking at it.

149
00:06:31,765 --> 00:06:33,432
You realize this isn't
one of those times

150
00:06:33,434 --> 00:06:36,518
I want you to exaggerate
how long something is.

151
00:06:41,909 --> 00:06:43,859
Okay, I got to...
I-I just...

152
00:06:43,861 --> 00:06:45,944
I got to ask:

153
00:06:45,946 --> 00:06:47,913
what makes you think
that your relationship

154
00:06:47,915 --> 00:06:50,449
is so wonderful
and ours isn't?

155
00:06:50,451 --> 00:06:52,034
For starters,

156
00:06:52,036 --> 00:06:54,202
we enjoy spending time together.

157
00:06:58,175 --> 00:06:59,758
So do we.

158
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:01,793
And I've seen you guys
ignore each other for hours

159
00:07:01,795 --> 00:07:03,679
doing totally
different things.

160
00:07:03,681 --> 00:07:07,182
It's called parallel play.

161
00:07:07,184 --> 00:07:08,884
Yeah, toddlers
do that.

162
00:07:08,886 --> 00:07:11,803
Not as well as we do.

163
00:07:13,057 --> 00:07:15,807
You believe this guy? He has to
be the best at everything.

164
00:07:15,809 --> 00:07:18,026
So what?
Why do you even care?

165
00:07:18,028 --> 00:07:19,645
Oh, listen to them.

166
00:07:19,647 --> 00:07:22,731
Not even married
and the honeymoon's over.

167
00:07:22,733 --> 00:07:25,283
Whatever. You can't
even go on a date

168
00:07:25,285 --> 00:07:27,452
without checking your
relationship agreement.

169
00:07:27,454 --> 00:07:31,123
If you've got a problem basing
a relationship on a contract,

170
00:07:31,125 --> 00:07:34,326
I'd like to tell you
about 13 plucky colonies

171
00:07:34,328 --> 00:07:36,461
that entered
a “relationship agreement”

172
00:07:36,463 --> 00:07:39,081
called the U.S. Constitution.

173
00:07:39,083 --> 00:07:41,416
And it may not be cool
to say so,

174
00:07:41,418 --> 00:07:44,336
but I think that love affair
is still pretty hot today.

175
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:48,640
It's a good thing I'm not
wearing flag underwear

176
00:07:48,642 --> 00:07:52,010
right now, 'cause there's
about to be a fire.

177
00:07:57,651 --> 00:07:59,851
Okay, it's not
that hard.

178
00:07:59,853 --> 00:08:01,520
You just look to where
you want to throw it,

179
00:08:01,522 --> 00:08:02,821
step towards where
you want to throw,

180
00:08:02,823 --> 00:08:04,189
and throw it.

181
00:08:07,111 --> 00:08:08,360
That's your help?

182
00:08:08,362 --> 00:08:11,697
That's like saying,
“Here's how you fly a plane:

183
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:13,115
“get in the airplane,

184
00:08:13,117 --> 00:08:16,702
know where you want
to go and fly it.”

185
00:08:18,038 --> 00:08:20,539
Just throw the ball. Let's see what
we're working with.

186
00:08:30,801 --> 00:08:32,551
Come on Howard, fire it in.

187
00:08:57,578 --> 00:08:59,745
Throw the damn ball!

188
00:09:09,218 --> 00:09:11,502
So when do you guys
plan on getting married?

189
00:09:11,504 --> 00:09:13,804
Uh, we're not sure.
But I want to wait long enough

190
00:09:13,806 --> 00:09:16,056
to prove to my mother
I'm not pregnant.

191
00:09:17,894 --> 00:09:19,643
May I have
one of your fries?

192
00:09:19,645 --> 00:09:21,312
Of course.

193
00:09:21,314 --> 00:09:23,180
Can I have a bite
of your burger?

194
00:09:23,182 --> 00:09:25,182
Absolutely not.

195
00:09:25,184 --> 00:09:27,518
Some perfect couple.

196
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:29,186
He won't even share
his food with her.

197
00:09:29,188 --> 00:09:30,988
It has avocado on it.

198
00:09:30,990 --> 00:09:33,190
She's allergic
to avocado.

199
00:09:33,192 --> 00:09:35,609
Are you so jealous
of our relationship

200
00:09:35,611 --> 00:09:38,279
you want Amy to die?

201
00:09:38,281 --> 00:09:40,581
I'm not jealous.

202
00:09:40,583 --> 00:09:42,867
I just think it's silly for
you to compare relationships

203
00:09:42,869 --> 00:09:45,419
like they're something
that can be quantified.

204
00:09:45,421 --> 00:09:47,254
Everything is quantifiable.

205
00:09:47,256 --> 00:09:50,124
That French fry? A seven.

206
00:09:50,126 --> 00:09:52,259
Spider-Man? A nine.

207
00:09:52,261 --> 00:09:55,596
The number nine—
oddly, only a four.

208
00:09:55,598 --> 00:09:57,548
How ridiculous is he?

209
00:09:57,550 --> 00:09:59,884
A hundred.

210
00:10:01,938 --> 00:10:04,104
Sheldon, you're just
assigning random numbers

211
00:10:04,106 --> 00:10:05,973
to things based on your opinion.

212
00:10:05,975 --> 00:10:07,358
No, I'm not.

213
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,276
French fries have
three variables—

214
00:10:09,278 --> 00:10:11,278
crispiness, saltiness
and shape.

215
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:12,646
Which is why a curly fry

216
00:10:12,648 --> 00:10:14,114
only gets a two.

217
00:10:14,116 --> 00:10:17,401
If I wanted curls for dinner,
I'd order a clown wig.

218
00:10:18,571 --> 00:10:22,289
Well, a relationship is more
complicated than a French fry.

219
00:10:22,291 --> 00:10:25,659
Not according to the work
of Berscheid, Snyder and Omoto.

220
00:10:25,661 --> 00:10:29,747
Oh, what did those
rascals do now?

221
00:10:29,749 --> 00:10:32,249
They developed the Relationship
Closeness Inventory,

222
00:10:32,251 --> 00:10:35,135
which predicts the stability
of a couple based on behavior.

223
00:10:35,137 --> 00:10:36,503
Yeah, not to be confused

224
00:10:36,505 --> 00:10:38,422
with the French Fry
Goodness Inventory.

225
00:10:38,424 --> 00:10:41,008
That's pure Cooper.

226
00:10:41,010 --> 00:10:42,810
So, this is accurate?

227
00:10:42,812 --> 00:10:44,595
It's been around for 25 years,

228
00:10:44,597 --> 00:10:46,263
and has been extensively
corroborated

229
00:10:46,265 --> 00:10:47,565
by other researchers.

230
00:10:47,567 --> 00:10:50,084
Well, kind of takes the romance
out of relationships.

231
00:10:50,086 --> 00:10:53,103
Kind of? It does it perfectly.

232
00:10:53,823 --> 00:10:55,155
Sheldon and I got

233
00:10:55,157 --> 00:10:56,607
an eight-point-two
out of ten.

234
00:10:56,609 --> 00:10:59,443
Fine. We'll take it
right now.

235
00:10:59,445 --> 00:11:00,778
No, don't.
What?

236
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:01,912
Just don't take it.

237
00:11:01,914 --> 00:11:02,947
Why not?
'Cause it's stupid.

238
00:11:02,949 --> 00:11:04,615
Who cares what
number it is?

239
00:11:04,617 --> 00:11:06,951
Come on. It'll be fun.
I said I don't want you to.

240
00:11:06,953 --> 00:11:09,703
I'm getting
another drink.

241
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:13,757
Sorry.

242
00:11:15,544 --> 00:11:18,495
I'm gonna let you
count this as two dates.

243
00:11:18,497 --> 00:11:20,664
They're a lot of work.

244
00:11:25,054 --> 00:11:27,488
Think he's getting
any better?

245
00:11:30,359 --> 00:11:32,559
Yup.

246
00:11:32,561 --> 00:11:34,828
That was a close one!

247
00:11:34,830 --> 00:11:37,448
Okay!

248
00:11:37,450 --> 00:11:39,650
Is it too late
for him to cancel?

249
00:11:39,652 --> 00:11:40,868
I think so.

250
00:11:45,024 --> 00:11:47,891
Heads up! Watch out!

251
00:11:55,051 --> 00:11:57,167
Are you mad at me?

252
00:11:57,169 --> 00:11:59,420
No, stop being stupid.

253
00:11:59,422 --> 00:12:02,756
Um... whew?

254
00:12:03,809 --> 00:12:06,427
Is this about the test,
or is this about us?

255
00:12:06,429 --> 00:12:08,345
Look, I don't need
a score on a test

256
00:12:08,347 --> 00:12:10,764
to make me worry about something
I'm already worried about.

257
00:12:10,766 --> 00:12:12,516
What are you worried about?

258
00:12:12,518 --> 00:12:15,519
That we're engaged and
have nothing in common,

259
00:12:15,521 --> 00:12:17,237
and it scares me.

260
00:12:17,239 --> 00:12:20,240
Yeah, that scares me, too.

261
00:12:20,242 --> 00:12:21,742
It does?

262
00:12:21,744 --> 00:12:23,243
Sometimes.

263
00:12:23,245 --> 00:12:25,913
Well, that's not good!

264
00:12:27,199 --> 00:12:29,700
You being blindly infatuated
with me was the rock

265
00:12:29,702 --> 00:12:32,786
we were building
this relationship on!

266
00:12:32,788 --> 00:12:36,373
Okay, well, this might
make you feel better.

267
00:12:36,375 --> 00:12:40,344
Uh, we're both scared that
our marriage will be a disaster,

268
00:12:40,346 --> 00:12:44,131
and so, that's something
that we have in common.

269
00:12:47,753 --> 00:12:50,604
Also, we both think
I'm not funny.

270
00:12:52,775 --> 00:12:55,559
Huh? See, you're not laughing.

271
00:12:59,999 --> 00:13:01,899
Hey, Froot Loops, what's up?

272
00:13:01,901 --> 00:13:04,418
Hey, Mike.

273
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:06,587
Listen, NASA asked me to

274
00:13:06,589 --> 00:13:09,323
throw out the first pitch
at an Angels game.

275
00:13:09,325 --> 00:13:11,392
You got any advice?

276
00:13:11,394 --> 00:13:13,394
Yeah. Don't do it.

277
00:13:14,930 --> 00:13:16,497
What else you up to?

278
00:13:16,499 --> 00:13:18,732
Why shouldn't I do it?

279
00:13:18,734 --> 00:13:20,100
There's no upside.

280
00:13:20,102 --> 00:13:22,136
If you do well, no one cares.

281
00:13:22,138 --> 00:13:23,737
And if you screw up,

282
00:13:23,739 --> 00:13:26,673
you're an idiot
on YouTube forever.

283
00:13:27,710 --> 00:13:29,760
But it's for a good cause.

284
00:13:29,762 --> 00:13:32,062
What about all the kids
that'll be there?

285
00:13:32,064 --> 00:13:33,514
That's what I'm telling you.

286
00:13:33,516 --> 00:13:35,315
Kids are the worst.

287
00:13:36,836 --> 00:13:40,437
My own daughter tweeted
I have a giant nose.

288
00:13:41,824 --> 00:13:43,574
Well, maybe I'll do a good job.

289
00:13:43,576 --> 00:13:44,775
I don't know.

290
00:13:44,777 --> 00:13:47,277
In space,
you couldn't even toss me a pen,

291
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:49,863
and that was in zero gravity.

292
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:53,300
Okay, thanks for the pep talk.

293
00:13:53,302 --> 00:13:54,685
Anytime, Froot Loops.

294
00:13:55,621 --> 00:13:57,337
Give your wife a hug for me.

295
00:13:57,339 --> 00:14:00,457
She's so much cuter than you, I
don't know how you ever got her.

296
00:14:02,528 --> 00:14:04,711
He's so nice.

297
00:14:08,551 --> 00:14:10,768
Hey, sorry about that.

298
00:14:10,770 --> 00:14:12,386
No, we're sorry.

299
00:14:12,388 --> 00:14:14,304
We never should have been
comparing relationships

300
00:14:14,306 --> 00:14:15,722
in the first place.

301
00:14:15,724 --> 00:14:18,025
Why? We won.

302
00:14:19,195 --> 00:14:21,311
You know, I say, next, we take
on Koothrappali and his dog.

303
00:14:21,313 --> 00:14:24,481
Really give
ourselves a challenge.

304
00:14:24,483 --> 00:14:26,733
I just want to say
one more thing about this.

305
00:14:26,735 --> 00:14:28,819
Just because Penny
and I are very different people

306
00:14:28,821 --> 00:14:30,654
does not mean
that we're a bad couple.

307
00:14:30,656 --> 00:14:33,657
The answer is
one simple test away.

308
00:14:33,659 --> 00:14:34,958
Hmm? You know,
it's like

309
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:37,327
when I thought there was
a possum in my closet.

310
00:14:37,329 --> 00:14:39,496
Did I sit around
wondering?

311
00:14:39,498 --> 00:14:43,333
No, I sent Leonard in with
a pointy stick and a bag.

312
00:14:43,335 --> 00:14:47,221
I killed
his Chewbacca slippers.

313
00:14:49,508 --> 00:14:50,724
Let's just
take the test.

314
00:14:50,726 --> 00:14:52,176
No, no, no,
I don't want to.

315
00:14:52,178 --> 00:14:53,894
Oh, well, 'cause you
know we're gonna do bad.

316
00:14:53,896 --> 00:14:55,229
Because it doesn't matter.

317
00:14:55,231 --> 00:14:58,015
I don't care
if we're a ten or a two.

318
00:14:58,017 --> 00:15:01,318
Or a one.
A one is possible.

319
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:03,937
Marriage is scary.

320
00:15:03,939 --> 00:15:05,355
You're scared, I'm scared.

321
00:15:05,357 --> 00:15:08,025
But it doesn't make me
not want to do it.

322
00:15:08,027 --> 00:15:10,077
It-it just...

323
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:13,447
makes me want to hold your hand
and do it with you.

324
00:15:14,884 --> 00:15:16,867
Leonard...

325
00:15:18,621 --> 00:15:22,039
It would make me so happy
if you said things like that.

326
00:15:22,041 --> 00:15:23,874
We got an
eight-point-two.

327
00:15:23,876 --> 00:15:26,043
Trust me, you're happy.

328
00:15:34,970 --> 00:15:38,355
Mm! I love how they put
a waterfall at center field.

329
00:15:38,357 --> 00:15:41,225
It really ties
the whole stadium together.

330
00:15:41,227 --> 00:15:43,527
Look at you, talking sports.

331
00:15:45,364 --> 00:15:46,647
This is fun, huh?

332
00:15:46,649 --> 00:15:48,899
We get to see our friend
throw out the first pitch,

333
00:15:48,901 --> 00:15:50,450
have a hot dog,
watch the game.

334
00:15:50,452 --> 00:15:52,319
Whoa.

335
00:15:52,321 --> 00:15:54,621
Nobody said anything
about watching the game.

336
00:15:55,708 --> 00:15:57,991
Sheldon, what
did you expect?

337
00:15:57,993 --> 00:16:02,246
I expected to see Howard throw
the baseball, finish my hot dog,

338
00:16:02,248 --> 00:16:04,631
and hightail it across
the street to Disneyland

339
00:16:04,633 --> 00:16:08,085
just in time for Mickey's
Soundsational Parade.

340
00:16:08,087 --> 00:16:09,670
I'll tell you what.

341
00:16:09,672 --> 00:16:13,840
If we stay, I'll buy you
cotton candy and a bobblehead.

342
00:16:13,842 --> 00:16:15,592
Who's the bobblehead of?

343
00:16:15,594 --> 00:16:17,227
Does it matter?

344
00:16:17,229 --> 00:16:20,097
No, as long as it bobbles.

345
00:16:21,433 --> 00:16:23,600
Howie, I am so proud of you.

346
00:16:23,602 --> 00:16:26,603
Thanks.
I'm proud of me, too.

347
00:16:26,605 --> 00:16:27,854
Mm-hmm.

348
00:16:27,856 --> 00:16:29,523
You ready?

349
00:16:29,525 --> 00:16:30,774
Let's do it.

350
00:16:30,776 --> 00:16:31,992
All right.

351
00:16:33,445 --> 00:16:35,495
Wish me luck.

352
00:16:35,497 --> 00:16:36,914
Go get 'em.

353
00:16:36,916 --> 00:16:38,332
Ladies and gentlemen,

354
00:16:38,334 --> 00:16:41,084
in honor of Space Day at
Angel Stadium, the first pitch

355
00:16:41,086 --> 00:16:45,789
will be thrown out by NASA
astronaut Howard Wolowitz.

356
00:16:48,711 --> 00:16:49,960
Thank you.

357
00:16:49,962 --> 00:16:51,878
Thank you.

358
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:53,463
Can he really
throw a ball?

359
00:16:53,465 --> 00:16:57,634
On our Quidditch team, he...
Yeah, that's a “no.”

360
00:16:57,636 --> 00:17:02,439
I have a message
for the young people here today.

361
00:17:02,441 --> 00:17:05,225
When I was asked
to throw the first pitch,

362
00:17:05,227 --> 00:17:10,397
a little voice in my head said
I couldn't do it.

363
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:13,650
So, I practiced and practiced,

364
00:17:13,652 --> 00:17:15,736
and you know what?

365
00:17:15,738 --> 00:17:18,155
That little voice...

366
00:17:18,157 --> 00:17:20,707
was right, but...

367
00:17:22,211 --> 00:17:25,979
then I remembered
that I'm not an athlete.

368
00:17:25,981 --> 00:17:28,265
I'm a scientist.

369
00:17:28,267 --> 00:17:29,666
So, today's

370
00:17:29,668 --> 00:17:32,002
first pitch will be delivered

371
00:17:32,004 --> 00:17:34,921
to home plate by science.

372
00:17:34,923 --> 00:17:36,423
Ladies and gentlemen,

373
00:17:36,425 --> 00:17:38,842
boys and girls, I present to you

374
00:17:38,844 --> 00:17:44,598
a working prototype
of the Mars Rover!

375
00:17:49,154 --> 00:17:51,772
And here's the wind-up...

376
00:17:51,774 --> 00:17:53,607
and the pitch!

377
00:18:05,204 --> 00:18:07,537
Why is it going so slow?

378
00:18:07,539 --> 00:18:10,624
'Cause I'm an idiot
who didn't think this through!

379
00:18:11,543 --> 00:18:13,093
Okay, new plan.

380
00:18:13,095 --> 00:18:14,711
We go to Disneyland,

381
00:18:14,713 --> 00:18:17,130
play hide and seek
on Tom Sawyer's Island,

382
00:18:17,132 --> 00:18:20,550
and then come back
and see the end of the pitch.

383
00:18:29,895 --> 00:18:32,696
Okay, while we're waiting
for the ball to arrive,

384
00:18:32,698 --> 00:18:34,698
here's some fun facts
about Mars.

385
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:38,068
You suck, Wolowitz!

386
00:18:39,288 --> 00:18:41,822
He makes a valid point!

387
00:19:01,711 --> 00:19:04,361
Okay, booing isn't gonna make it
go any faster!

388
00:19:07,617 --> 00:19:14,117
