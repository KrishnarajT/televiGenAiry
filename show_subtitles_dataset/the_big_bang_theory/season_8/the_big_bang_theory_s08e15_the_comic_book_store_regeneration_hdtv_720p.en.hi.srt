2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:07,054
I've invented a science joke,
would you like to hear it?

3
00:00:07,055 --> 00:00:08,234
Sure.

4
00:00:08,235 --> 00:00:11,836
How many Edisons does it take
to screw in a light bulb?

5
00:00:11,838 --> 00:00:13,505
How many?

6
00:00:13,507 --> 00:00:15,507
Who cares?
He stole the idea

7
00:00:15,509 --> 00:00:17,842
and doesn't deserve
his own joke.

8
00:00:17,844 --> 00:00:19,411
Is that really true?

9
00:00:19,413 --> 00:00:22,080
Of course, that's how you know
it's a good joke.

10
00:00:22,082 --> 00:00:24,716
It not only entertains,
it informs.

11
00:00:26,185 --> 00:00:27,752
Hey, sorry
to interrupt.

12
00:00:27,754 --> 00:00:29,087
Uh, Barry,

13
00:00:29,089 --> 00:00:32,290
uh, how many Edisons does it
take to screw in a light bulb?

14
00:00:32,292 --> 00:00:34,692
Did you know Edison didn't
actually invent the light bulb?

15
00:00:37,930 --> 00:00:40,265
What do you want,
Barry?

16
00:00:40,267 --> 00:00:43,268
Just wanted to drop this off
as a little thank you for Amy.

17
00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:44,602
What's this for?

18
00:00:44,604 --> 00:00:46,404
Your idea really
helped me out.

19
00:00:46,406 --> 00:00:49,040
My light-cone quantization
paper's online already.

20
00:00:49,042 --> 00:00:51,543
The response
has been amazing.

21
00:00:51,545 --> 00:00:52,977
Well, that's
fascinating.

22
00:00:52,979 --> 00:00:54,446
I can't wait to read it.

23
00:00:54,448 --> 00:00:55,780
Oh, no, me as well.

24
00:00:55,782 --> 00:00:59,884
Uh, please e-mail it
to Sheldon@Bazinga.biz.

25
00:00:59,886 --> 00:01:01,219
Why "dot-biz"?

26
00:01:01,221 --> 00:01:02,754
Because I just gave
you the business.

27
00:01:03,923 --> 00:01:05,924
And also Bazinga.com
was taken.

28
00:01:07,593 --> 00:01:09,594
Anyway, thanks again.

29
00:01:09,596 --> 00:01:11,262
Cooper, suck eggs.

30
00:01:13,766 --> 00:01:16,000
Since when do you help out
Barry Kripke?

31
00:01:16,002 --> 00:01:18,503
Well, I'd been thinking about
a cellular automata approach

32
00:01:18,505 --> 00:01:20,004
to neuronal connectivity,

33
00:01:20,006 --> 00:01:21,840
and I thought it might have
some interesting applications

34
00:01:21,842 --> 00:01:23,408
to string theory...
It's not a big deal.

35
00:01:23,410 --> 00:01:25,310
Oh, really?

36
00:01:25,312 --> 00:01:27,979
When I was doing string theory
and hit a dead end,

37
00:01:27,981 --> 00:01:29,747
why didn't you try to help me?

38
00:01:29,749 --> 00:01:32,750
I did... you said the only
math biologists know is

39
00:01:32,752 --> 00:01:34,919
if you have three frogs
and one hops away,

40
00:01:34,921 --> 00:01:37,155
that leaves two frogs.

41
00:01:37,157 --> 00:01:40,425
That's pretty funny,
that does sound like me.

42
00:01:40,427 --> 00:01:41,593
But that doesn't mean

43
00:01:41,595 --> 00:01:43,561
that you should be
standing on street corners

44
00:01:43,563 --> 00:01:46,798
handing out your math
to whatever guy comes along.

45
00:01:48,167 --> 00:01:49,834
Sheldon, we're all scientists.

46
00:01:49,836 --> 00:01:51,503
I helped out
a fellow colleague.

47
00:01:51,505 --> 00:01:52,837
You're being petty.

48
00:01:52,839 --> 00:01:54,439
I'm being petty?

49
00:01:54,441 --> 00:01:57,775
You know Barry and I
have a professional rivalry.

50
00:01:57,777 --> 00:01:59,878
You heard him...
He told me to suck eggs.

51
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:01,880
If we were friends,
he would have suggested

52
00:02:01,882 --> 00:02:03,281
I suck something
more pleasant.

53
00:02:06,452 --> 00:02:08,152
Why are you laughing?

54
00:02:08,154 --> 00:02:09,654

@elder_man

65
00:02:40,291 --> 00:02:41,625
Okay, Ma.

66
00:02:41,627 --> 00:02:43,293
Say hi to Aunt Gladys.

67
00:02:43,295 --> 00:02:44,561
Yeah, I love you,
too.

68
00:02:44,563 --> 00:02:45,563
Bye.

69
00:02:45,564 --> 00:02:47,397
Your mom having fun in Florida?

70
00:02:47,399 --> 00:02:48,732
Mmm, she loves it.

71
00:02:48,734 --> 00:02:50,734
She finally found a place
where everyone talks about

72
00:02:50,736 --> 00:02:52,135
how sweaty they are.

73
00:02:53,171 --> 00:02:55,172
Anyway, she wants us
to go to the house

74
00:02:55,174 --> 00:02:58,275
and check in on Stuart
because he might be "lonely."

75
00:02:58,277 --> 00:02:59,943
She's just being nice.

76
00:02:59,945 --> 00:03:02,179
Well, I'm her son, how come
she doesn't send someone

77
00:03:02,181 --> 00:03:03,847
to check on me if I'm lonely?

78
00:03:03,849 --> 00:03:05,849
Because you have a wife.

79
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:11,988
Yeah, well, sometimes
you work late.

80
00:03:11,990 --> 00:03:14,958
I know you don't like
Stuart being in the house,

81
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,460
but the store's
about to reopen,

82
00:03:16,462 --> 00:03:17,828
I'm sure he'll get
back on his feet.

83
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:19,363
That would be great.

84
00:03:19,365 --> 00:03:21,765
I'd love for things between me
and Mom to get back to normal.

85
00:03:21,767 --> 00:03:25,402
Well, normal's a
strong word, but sure.

86
00:03:29,607 --> 00:03:32,008
Hey.
Hello.

87
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:33,543
You okay?

88
00:03:33,545 --> 00:03:35,879
If I was okay,
I would've said "hello"

89
00:03:35,881 --> 00:03:37,614
and not the much more
ominous "hello."

90
00:03:39,317 --> 00:03:40,317
What's going on?

91
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:41,785
I'm mad at Amy.

92
00:03:41,787 --> 00:03:45,722
Did she leave pit stains
in your favorite crop top, too?

93
00:03:45,724 --> 00:03:48,392
No.

94
00:03:48,394 --> 00:03:51,895
She helped Barry Kripke make
an advancement in string theory.

95
00:03:51,897 --> 00:03:54,030
Oh, that sounds
like a good thing.

96
00:03:54,032 --> 00:03:56,900
Well, it would be,
except that I left string theory

97
00:03:56,902 --> 00:03:58,835
because I decided
it was a dead end.

98
00:03:58,837 --> 00:04:01,004
Yeah, and then she went
behind my back

99
00:04:01,006 --> 00:04:02,873
to help someone else
prove me wrong.

100
00:04:02,875 --> 00:04:04,474
My rival, no less.

101
00:04:16,087 --> 00:04:18,388
I'm sorry you had to see that.

102
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:21,758
I'm sorry I didn't have
a camera.

103
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:23,760
Why would she
do this to me?

104
00:04:23,762 --> 00:04:26,430
Well, I'm sure she didn't
upset you on purpose.

105
00:04:26,432 --> 00:04:27,931
Besides, aren't you
the one who says

106
00:04:27,933 --> 00:04:30,534
there's nothing more important
than the advancement of science?

107
00:04:30,536 --> 00:04:33,036
No, I said there's
nothing more important

108
00:04:33,038 --> 00:04:35,372
than me advancing science.

109
00:04:35,374 --> 00:04:37,340
All right, well, if I'm
understanding this right,

110
00:04:37,342 --> 00:04:39,676
and all she did was help
out another scientist,

111
00:04:39,678 --> 00:04:42,345
I'm thinking you might
have to let this one go.

112
00:04:42,347 --> 00:04:44,347
Ugh, "let it go."

113
00:04:44,349 --> 00:04:46,716
I have heard that
my whole life.

114
00:04:46,718 --> 00:04:48,885
Every time something upsets me
somebody says, "let it go,"

115
00:04:48,887 --> 00:04:50,387
you know,
like it's my fault,

116
00:04:50,389 --> 00:04:52,389
and it's not okay
to feel the way I feel.

117
00:04:52,391 --> 00:04:53,790
I don't know
what to tell you.

118
00:04:53,792 --> 00:04:55,225
I mean, why don't
you talk to her?

119
00:04:55,227 --> 00:04:57,227
Is that all you have?

120
00:04:57,229 --> 00:05:00,163
Shopworn tidbits like
"talk to her" and "let it go"?

121
00:05:00,165 --> 00:05:02,032
Gee, Penny,
life's giving me lemons.

122
00:05:02,034 --> 00:05:03,366
What should I do?

123
00:05:03,368 --> 00:05:05,702
Well, you could shove
them somewhere.

124
00:05:08,072 --> 00:05:10,407
Okay, now you're
getting creative.

125
00:05:11,776 --> 00:05:13,443
Thanks again
for your help.

126
00:05:13,445 --> 00:05:14,778
No problem.
Our pleasure.

127
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:16,246
The place really
looks great.

128
00:05:16,248 --> 00:05:18,715
Yeah, you should have
burned it down years ago.

129
00:05:18,717 --> 00:05:22,085
I keep telling you
I didn't burn it down.

130
00:05:22,087 --> 00:05:23,753
We know, we know...
Because burning something down

131
00:05:23,755 --> 00:05:26,590
for the insurance money
is a "crime."

132
00:05:27,758 --> 00:05:30,827
Stuart, this place
looks amazing.

133
00:05:30,829 --> 00:05:31,795
Thanks.

134
00:05:31,797 --> 00:05:34,064
You really did
a nice job.

135
00:05:34,066 --> 00:05:36,399
And thank you
for putting up with me

136
00:05:36,401 --> 00:05:38,068
staying at your mom's
through all this.

137
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:40,070
I-I couldn't have done it
otherwise.

138
00:05:40,072 --> 00:05:43,073
I appreciate that,
and I'm glad you were able to...

139
00:05:44,942 --> 00:05:46,276
Is that my mother's furniture?

140
00:05:49,614 --> 00:05:50,914
Yeah, she said
I could use it.

141
00:05:50,916 --> 00:05:52,282
Doesn't it look
great?

142
00:05:52,284 --> 00:05:55,418
Not as great as it looks in
the den where it belongs.

143
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:57,120
Howie.

144
00:05:57,122 --> 00:06:00,223
Why don't you just clean out
the whole room?

145
00:06:00,225 --> 00:06:02,559
Take the string art clown
I made her in third grade

146
00:06:02,561 --> 00:06:04,160
and the ribbon I got
in swim class

147
00:06:04,162 --> 00:06:05,595
for putting my face
in the water.

148
00:06:05,597 --> 00:06:06,930
What is your problem?

149
00:06:06,932 --> 00:06:08,265
She said it was okay.

150
00:06:08,267 --> 00:06:10,867
Well, I'm her son,
and I say it's not okay.

151
00:06:10,869 --> 00:06:14,237
Some son... looks like you spent
ten minutes on that clown art.

152
00:06:16,173 --> 00:06:18,642
Well, maybe I should've gone
to a fancy art school like you.

153
00:06:18,644 --> 00:06:20,277
Then I could run
a failed comic shop

154
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:21,578
and mooch off
some guy's mother.

155
00:06:22,947 --> 00:06:24,514
Why don't we leave
so you can cool off?

156
00:06:24,516 --> 00:06:26,516
I think that's
a good idea.

157
00:06:26,518 --> 00:06:27,784
Take him out
of my store.

158
00:06:27,786 --> 00:06:28,885
Your store?

159
00:06:28,887 --> 00:06:30,887
My mother gave you
the money to reopen.

160
00:06:30,889 --> 00:06:32,489
I'm not going anywhere.

161
00:06:32,491 --> 00:06:34,190
Why don't we go get
the food for the party.

162
00:06:34,192 --> 00:06:35,292
Thank you.

163
00:06:35,294 --> 00:06:37,294
Smart... looks like
we're being helpful.

164
00:06:37,296 --> 00:06:38,962
Mmm, when really
we're just exiting

165
00:06:38,964 --> 00:06:40,630
an uncomfortable
situation.

166
00:06:43,734 --> 00:06:46,536
Kripke, you know, of all
the people... Barry Kripke.

167
00:06:46,538 --> 00:06:48,705
I'm so... Are you folding
it like a crazy person

168
00:06:48,707 --> 00:06:50,373
to get me to
do it for you?

169
00:06:51,509 --> 00:06:52,676
No.

170
00:06:55,212 --> 00:06:56,546
Oh, give me that.

171
00:07:02,153 --> 00:07:04,487
Just out of curiosity,

172
00:07:04,489 --> 00:07:07,157
if I were to let something go,

173
00:07:07,159 --> 00:07:08,558
how would I do that?

174
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:11,528
I don't know... just think
about something else.

175
00:07:12,997 --> 00:07:14,998
Can I think
about the spiny anteater?

176
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,166
Sure.

177
00:07:16,168 --> 00:07:18,835
The spiny anteater...

178
00:07:18,837 --> 00:07:21,838
never went behind my back
and worked with Barry Kripke.

179
00:07:23,541 --> 00:07:26,209
That didn't help at all.

180
00:07:26,211 --> 00:07:29,179
You know, some people
try visualization.

181
00:07:29,181 --> 00:07:30,680
How does that work?

182
00:07:32,717 --> 00:07:34,517
Okay,

183
00:07:34,519 --> 00:07:37,554
imagine your problems
are a pen.

184
00:07:38,889 --> 00:07:40,423
Okay.

185
00:07:40,425 --> 00:07:42,993
Now imagine
you're holding that pen.

186
00:07:47,632 --> 00:07:49,633
Okay.

187
00:07:49,635 --> 00:07:52,869
Now open your hand
and let it go.

188
00:07:52,871 --> 00:07:54,938
But I just got this pen.

189
00:07:56,307 --> 00:07:58,908
It's got my initials on it
and everything.

190
00:07:58,910 --> 00:08:00,577
Look.

191
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:05,115
Sheldon, this isn't
that hard.

192
00:08:07,485 --> 00:08:09,953
I may have a better way
that you can teach me.

193
00:08:09,955 --> 00:08:11,388
How?

194
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:15,058
What if I told you
that over the past few months

195
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:18,061
Amy has secretly been giving you
little puzzles

196
00:08:18,063 --> 00:08:21,064
to test your intelligence
against chimpanzees in her lab?

197
00:08:23,267 --> 00:08:24,768
What? She didn't
give me any puzzles.

198
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:26,903
Are you sure?

199
00:08:29,807 --> 00:08:33,243
Boy, I just can't seem to get
these scissors back together.

200
00:08:33,245 --> 00:08:35,045
Can you do it?

201
00:08:36,514 --> 00:08:37,847
Darn it.

202
00:08:37,849 --> 00:08:39,249
There's something
in my eye,

203
00:08:39,251 --> 00:08:42,919
and I need to sort
these coins by size.

204
00:08:42,921 --> 00:08:44,254
Can you help?

205
00:08:49,427 --> 00:08:51,695
Penny?

206
00:08:51,697 --> 00:08:53,697
I really want to
eat this banana,

207
00:08:53,699 --> 00:08:56,700
but it's stuck inside
this bamboo puzzle box.

208
00:08:59,770 --> 00:09:02,839
Son of a bitch!

209
00:09:02,841 --> 00:09:04,240
Okay, that's great.

210
00:09:04,242 --> 00:09:06,076
Now, let it go.

211
00:09:15,319 --> 00:09:18,388
I can't believe you were
testing me against a chimp!

212
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:21,057
Well, excuse me,
Amy was testing you.

213
00:09:21,059 --> 00:09:23,326
I was rooting for you.

214
00:09:24,662 --> 00:09:27,897
Good job on that banana box,
by the way.

215
00:09:27,899 --> 00:09:30,667
Why would she
even do this?

216
00:09:30,669 --> 00:09:32,669
She's been conducting
an experiment on apes

217
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:34,571
where they're given
various puzzles to solve.

218
00:09:34,573 --> 00:09:37,240
I was surprised
at the complexity of the puzzles

219
00:09:37,242 --> 00:09:39,576
and thought some humans wouldn't
be able to solve them.

220
00:09:39,578 --> 00:09:42,946
That's when Amy said,
"Want to make this interesting?"

221
00:09:43,981 --> 00:09:45,482
"Make this interesting"?

222
00:09:45,484 --> 00:09:47,083
You bet money on me?

223
00:09:47,085 --> 00:09:48,418
No, no.

224
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:51,087
We designed an experiment
involving you.

225
00:09:51,089 --> 00:09:53,523
See? Now, isn't that
interesting?

226
00:09:53,525 --> 00:09:55,859
It's not interesting.

227
00:09:55,861 --> 00:09:57,727
It's incredibly insulting.

228
00:09:57,729 --> 00:10:00,063
Okay,
maybe this will help...

229
00:10:00,065 --> 00:10:02,465
Imagine you're holding a pen.

230
00:10:04,502 --> 00:10:07,003
Before you go too far,
not a special pen

231
00:10:07,005 --> 00:10:08,505
with your initials
engraved on it...

232
00:10:08,507 --> 00:10:10,073
That'll make the next part
really hard.

233
00:10:10,075 --> 00:10:11,075
Oh...

234
00:10:11,076 --> 00:10:12,076
That's it.

235
00:10:12,077 --> 00:10:13,077
Get out!

236
00:10:13,078 --> 00:10:15,078
I don't understand
why you're mad at me.

237
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:16,746
You should be mad
at Amy.

238
00:10:16,748 --> 00:10:18,715
Like I was
this afternoon.

239
00:10:18,717 --> 00:10:20,383
Hey, look at that...
I let it go.

240
00:10:20,385 --> 00:10:21,818
Get out!

241
00:10:24,522 --> 00:10:25,889
Penny?
What?

242
00:10:25,891 --> 00:10:28,858
I think I left
my pen in there.

243
00:10:32,129 --> 00:10:34,130
I understand
why you're upset,

244
00:10:34,132 --> 00:10:36,599
but he worked really hard
to get the store ready.

245
00:10:36,601 --> 00:10:39,069
And it's just furniture.

246
00:10:39,071 --> 00:10:40,904
It's my mom's furniture.

247
00:10:40,906 --> 00:10:42,906
It belongs in the house
I grew up in...

248
00:10:42,908 --> 00:10:44,407
Next to that pile of TV Guides

249
00:10:44,409 --> 00:10:47,410
and in plain view of what,
for a ten-year-old, was

250
00:10:47,412 --> 00:10:49,079
a quality piece
of string art!

251
00:10:52,450 --> 00:10:54,984
Howie, if the store succeeds,
Stuart has a source of income,

252
00:10:54,986 --> 00:10:57,320
and he can move out
of your mother's house.

253
00:10:57,322 --> 00:10:59,255
Seems like some old furniture
is a reasonable price

254
00:10:59,257 --> 00:11:00,323
to pay for that.

255
00:11:01,692 --> 00:11:03,093
That is a good point.

256
00:11:03,095 --> 00:11:04,728
But I didn't marry you
for good points.

257
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:06,162
I married you
to blindly support me

258
00:11:06,164 --> 00:11:08,131
no matter how ridiculous
I'm being!

259
00:11:10,167 --> 00:11:12,302
This is why I had
to rewrite our wedding vows.

260
00:11:16,774 --> 00:11:20,009
Hi, we're here to pick up
an order for Comic Center.

261
00:11:20,011 --> 00:11:21,478
Sure, let me go check on that.

262
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:26,449
Dude, I-I think
that's Nathan Fillion.

263
00:11:27,585 --> 00:11:29,586
Oh yeah,
look at that.

264
00:11:29,588 --> 00:11:32,021
And he's picking
the tomatoes out of his salad

265
00:11:32,023 --> 00:11:34,023
just like I do.

266
00:11:34,025 --> 00:11:36,059
I always did feel
a connection with him.

267
00:11:38,028 --> 00:11:39,829
Oh, I have got
an idea.

268
00:11:39,831 --> 00:11:42,766
We're not selling
his tomatoes on eBay.

269
00:11:42,768 --> 00:11:46,770
No, if we got Captain Reynolds
from Firefly

270
00:11:46,772 --> 00:11:49,105
to do a signing
at Stuart's store,

271
00:11:49,107 --> 00:11:50,540
that would be
amazing.

272
00:11:50,542 --> 00:11:51,875
That would be great.

273
00:11:51,877 --> 00:11:53,643
So should we go
talk to him?

274
00:11:53,645 --> 00:11:55,044
I don't know.

275
00:11:55,046 --> 00:11:57,714
I mean, if he's not nice,
it's gonna make it hard for me

276
00:11:57,716 --> 00:11:59,883
to watch him in anything again.
What?

277
00:11:59,885 --> 00:12:02,886
The-the guy who plays
Jon Snow was a jerk.

278
00:12:02,888 --> 00:12:04,354
We still watch
Game of Thrones.

279
00:12:04,356 --> 00:12:06,956
He was a jerk because
you rear-ended him.

280
00:12:07,992 --> 00:12:09,659
I was distracted.

281
00:12:09,661 --> 00:12:11,661
It's weird seeing a member
of the Night's Watch

282
00:12:11,663 --> 00:12:13,196
with a kayak strapped
to his car.

283
00:12:14,899 --> 00:12:15,899
Come on.

284
00:12:21,005 --> 00:12:22,806
Hi,
excuse me, s-s...

285
00:12:22,808 --> 00:12:24,140
I-I don't mean
to bother you,

286
00:12:24,142 --> 00:12:26,476
but we're just really
big fans of Firefly.

287
00:12:26,478 --> 00:12:28,044
A-And Dr. Horrible.

288
00:12:28,046 --> 00:12:29,979
Oh, uh, I think
you made a mistake.

289
00:12:29,981 --> 00:12:31,314
I'm not an actor.

290
00:12:31,316 --> 00:12:33,650
Don't say that.

291
00:12:33,652 --> 00:12:35,151
I mean, you're not
Dame Judi Dench,

292
00:12:35,153 --> 00:12:36,820
but you're
pretty great.

293
00:12:40,057 --> 00:12:42,225
Oh, yeah, I get it...
You think I'm Nathan Fillion,

294
00:12:42,227 --> 00:12:43,726
but I'm not.

295
00:12:43,728 --> 00:12:46,162
So if you don't mind, I would
just love to eat my lunch.

296
00:12:47,531 --> 00:12:48,531
Come on.

297
00:12:48,533 --> 00:12:50,366
Sorry to bother you.

298
00:12:50,368 --> 00:12:52,368
Don't know why
he's so grumpy.

299
00:12:52,370 --> 00:12:54,704
I got mistaken for that guy
in Life of Pi once,

300
00:12:54,706 --> 00:12:57,073
and I'm still
floating.

301
00:12:59,777 --> 00:13:02,579
Sheldon, it's me.

302
00:13:02,581 --> 00:13:03,581
Oh, hey.

303
00:13:03,582 --> 00:13:05,415
D-Did you see that?

304
00:13:05,417 --> 00:13:08,985
I-I figured out how to open
the door all by myself.

305
00:13:10,621 --> 00:13:14,457
Maybe I'll fling some feces
around my cage to celebrate.

306
00:13:15,793 --> 00:13:17,961
What are you talking about?

307
00:13:17,963 --> 00:13:20,230
I know you've been giving me
secret puzzle tests.

308
00:13:23,234 --> 00:13:24,901
Sheldon, open
the door.

309
00:13:24,903 --> 00:13:26,569
I can't.

310
00:13:26,571 --> 00:13:29,572
I'm naked.

311
00:13:29,574 --> 00:13:31,574
I just saw you.

312
00:13:31,576 --> 00:13:33,877
Hang on.

313
00:13:33,879 --> 00:13:36,446
Open the door now.

314
00:13:36,448 --> 00:13:38,114
- Oh, hey.
- Pull up your pants!

315
00:13:41,285 --> 00:13:42,619
It's not a big deal.

316
00:13:42,621 --> 00:13:45,822
I run tests like this on
undergrads all the time.

317
00:13:45,824 --> 00:13:47,490
If you fill out some
paperwork at the university,

318
00:13:47,492 --> 00:13:49,792
I can get you $5.

319
00:13:49,794 --> 00:13:51,461
I don't want $5.

320
00:13:51,463 --> 00:13:53,029
I want my dignity.

321
00:13:54,398 --> 00:13:56,065
So what are we talking,
like, ten bucks?

322
00:13:58,535 --> 00:14:00,103
Thank you.
Thanks.

323
00:14:02,273 --> 00:14:04,173
Sorry again.
No problem.

324
00:14:04,175 --> 00:14:07,343
A-Are you sure
you're not him?

325
00:14:07,345 --> 00:14:08,511
Uh, you can tell us.

326
00:14:08,513 --> 00:14:11,114
We're scientists,
not crazy fanboys.

327
00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:14,651
All right, fine.

328
00:14:14,653 --> 00:14:16,119
I'm him.

329
00:14:16,121 --> 00:14:19,455
And you're eating
alone at a deli.

330
00:14:19,457 --> 00:14:21,658
I don't buy it...
You're not him.

331
00:14:22,994 --> 00:14:24,827
I just wanted
to eat my lunch in peace.

332
00:14:24,829 --> 00:14:25,995
But I really am him.

333
00:14:25,997 --> 00:14:28,097
And thank you very much
for being a fan.

334
00:14:28,099 --> 00:14:29,632
If you want, uh,
let's take a picture.

335
00:14:29,634 --> 00:14:30,967
That would be great.

336
00:14:30,969 --> 00:14:32,101
Great.
Yeah, thank you.

337
00:14:32,103 --> 00:14:33,436
You bet.

338
00:14:37,174 --> 00:14:39,509
Wait, hang on.

339
00:14:39,511 --> 00:14:41,878
If you're really
Nathan Fillion,

340
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:44,914
what's the line from Firefly
about your bonnet?

341
00:14:46,317 --> 00:14:48,651
"I swear by my pretty floral
bonnet, I will end you."

342
00:14:50,955 --> 00:14:52,455
That's it,
that's the line.

343
00:14:52,457 --> 00:14:54,457
Although...

344
00:14:54,459 --> 00:14:57,160
I knew the line...
Doesn't make me Nathan Fillion.

345
00:14:58,295 --> 00:15:00,563
Do you want the picture or not?

346
00:15:00,565 --> 00:15:03,399
I want a picture
with Nathan Fillion.

347
00:15:03,401 --> 00:15:06,736
How about a picture with a guy
who looks like Nathan Fillion

348
00:15:06,738 --> 00:15:09,973
but a little more annoyed
than Nathan Fillion usually is?

349
00:15:12,576 --> 00:15:13,609
What do you think?

350
00:15:14,979 --> 00:15:16,312
Eh, it's good enough
for Facebook.

351
00:15:24,321 --> 00:15:25,888
I can't believe
they did that.

352
00:15:25,890 --> 00:15:27,890
I know... it's so insulting.

353
00:15:27,892 --> 00:15:29,559
At one point,
they had me figure out

354
00:15:29,561 --> 00:15:32,528
how to get a banana
out of a puzzle box.

355
00:15:32,530 --> 00:15:35,531
Wait, Sheldon gave me
a banana in a box.

356
00:15:35,533 --> 00:15:37,734
He was testing me, too.

357
00:15:37,736 --> 00:15:39,736
Unbelievable.

358
00:15:39,738 --> 00:15:41,571
And how could a chimp
even solve that?

359
00:15:41,573 --> 00:15:43,072
That was impossible.

360
00:15:43,074 --> 00:15:45,441
Really? You couldn't get it out?

361
00:15:49,046 --> 00:15:50,380
Thank you.

362
00:15:50,382 --> 00:15:52,382
Wow, the
store looks great.

363
00:15:52,384 --> 00:15:54,384
So you guys were
testing us both?

364
00:15:54,386 --> 00:15:55,418
What is the
matter with you?

365
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:56,919
Eh, what's
the matter with them is

366
00:15:56,921 --> 00:15:58,521
they think they're so smart
they don't care

367
00:15:58,523 --> 00:16:00,189
if they hurt
other people's feelings.

368
00:16:00,191 --> 00:16:01,858
Sounds like us.
That's not true.

369
00:16:04,528 --> 00:16:07,196
I still don't understand
why you're upset.

370
00:16:07,198 --> 00:16:10,199
You solved every puzzle faster
than all of the chimps.

371
00:16:10,201 --> 00:16:12,869
Well, except Barnabas,
but he was on Adderall.

372
00:16:14,371 --> 00:16:16,873
I'm sorry, but it's
making me crazy.

373
00:16:16,875 --> 00:16:19,208
Can you please
just let it go?

374
00:16:19,210 --> 00:16:21,177
Oh, I can help
you with that.

375
00:16:22,546 --> 00:16:24,981
Imagine you're holding
an ordinary pen.

376
00:16:27,051 --> 00:16:30,053
While your favorite pen is
safe and secure in your pocket.

377
00:16:32,690 --> 00:16:34,457
Hold that thought.

378
00:16:34,459 --> 00:16:35,459
Hello?

379
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:37,727
How can I make this up
to you?

380
00:16:37,729 --> 00:16:40,396
The answer's
in this puzzle box.

381
00:16:40,398 --> 00:16:42,565
Let's see
if you can open it.

382
00:16:45,869 --> 00:16:48,404
You could have at least warned
him about the furniture.

383
00:16:48,406 --> 00:16:50,473
That's what I said
when we moved it.

384
00:16:50,475 --> 00:16:51,974
You helped him?

385
00:16:51,976 --> 00:16:54,977
No, Stuart picked out those
throw pillows all on his own.

386
00:16:59,183 --> 00:17:01,184
Hey, you okay?

387
00:17:01,186 --> 00:17:02,618
Uh, no.

388
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:03,786
What's wrong?

389
00:17:03,788 --> 00:17:05,788
Um...

390
00:17:05,790 --> 00:17:08,291
my mom died.

391
00:17:08,293 --> 00:17:10,393
What?

392
00:17:10,395 --> 00:17:12,728
Uh...

393
00:17:12,730 --> 00:17:15,731
that was my aunt.

394
00:17:15,733 --> 00:17:18,734
Ma took a nap.

395
00:17:18,736 --> 00:17:20,069
She never woke up.

396
00:17:21,105 --> 00:17:23,106
Oh, my God, Howie.

397
00:17:25,609 --> 00:17:27,477
I'm so sorry.

398
00:17:28,745 --> 00:17:30,079
What can we do?

399
00:17:32,783 --> 00:17:34,784
I don't know.

400
00:17:39,189 --> 00:17:40,990
May I say something?

401
00:17:40,992 --> 00:17:42,325
Not right
now, Sheldon.

402
00:17:42,327 --> 00:17:43,659
But I think it would
be comforting.

403
00:17:43,661 --> 00:17:45,595
Buddy...
No, it's okay.

404
00:17:45,597 --> 00:17:47,497
What?

405
00:17:48,532 --> 00:17:51,200
When I lost my own father,

406
00:17:51,202 --> 00:17:53,402
I didn't have any friends
to help me through it.

407
00:17:54,671 --> 00:17:56,305
You do.

408
00:18:01,812 --> 00:18:04,881
I really thought
he was gonna say, "Let it go."

409
00:18:16,765 --> 00:18:18,364
Okay, thanks, Bernadette.

410
00:18:18,366 --> 00:18:20,032
Travel safe.

411
00:18:20,034 --> 00:18:22,702
Okay, bye.

412
00:18:24,038 --> 00:18:25,204
They booked a flight.

413
00:18:25,206 --> 00:18:26,439
They're heading
to the airport now.

414
00:18:26,441 --> 00:18:28,241
How's Howard holding up?

415
00:18:28,243 --> 00:18:29,575
He's hanging in there.

416
00:18:29,577 --> 00:18:31,210
How are you doing, Stuart?

417
00:18:33,247 --> 00:18:34,580
Still can't believe she's gone.

418
00:18:34,582 --> 00:18:37,550
I mean, that woman took me in.

419
00:18:37,552 --> 00:18:40,286
If it wasn't for her,
I-I would have been homeless.

420
00:18:40,288 --> 00:18:42,288
One of us would
have taken you in.

421
00:18:42,290 --> 00:18:44,590
Yeah, I don't recall any offers.

422
00:18:46,393 --> 00:18:49,061
But, you know, uh, I-I'm glad
it worked out the way it did

423
00:18:49,063 --> 00:18:53,132
because I got to know
this wonderful person.

424
00:18:53,134 --> 00:18:54,801
Yeah.

425
00:18:54,803 --> 00:18:56,702
Mrs. Wolowitz was
pretty special.

426
00:18:56,704 --> 00:18:58,971
When I first moved to America,

427
00:18:58,973 --> 00:19:01,507
Howard was my only friend.

428
00:19:01,509 --> 00:19:04,744
She made me feel
so welcome in her home.

429
00:19:04,746 --> 00:19:07,747
Which says a lot,
because, those first few years,

430
00:19:07,749 --> 00:19:10,416
she thought I was the gardener.

431
00:19:11,552 --> 00:19:13,219
Whenever I saw her,

432
00:19:13,221 --> 00:19:16,222
she'd say I was too skinny
and try and feed me.

433
00:19:17,826 --> 00:19:19,759
She did that to me, too.

434
00:19:19,761 --> 00:19:22,128
Don't take this away from me.

435
00:19:23,263 --> 00:19:25,765
I didn't care
for her yelling.

436
00:19:25,767 --> 00:19:28,768
But now that I'm not going
to hear it again,

437
00:19:28,770 --> 00:19:30,336
I'm sad.

438
00:19:30,338 --> 00:19:32,338
If you want,
I can yell at you later.

439
00:19:35,175 --> 00:19:36,475
It won't be as good.

440
00:19:39,513 --> 00:19:40,913
Let's have a toast.

441
00:19:43,016 --> 00:19:44,684
To Mrs. Wolowitz.

442
00:19:45,563 --> 00:19:47,529
A loving mother...

443
00:19:50,533 --> 00:19:52,534
to all of us.

444
00:19:52,536 --> 00:19:54,403
We'll miss you.

445
