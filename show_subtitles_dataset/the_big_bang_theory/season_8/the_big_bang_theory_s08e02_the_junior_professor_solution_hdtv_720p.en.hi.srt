1
00:00:02,922 --> 00:00:05,957
I recently read
that during World War Two,

2
00:00:05,959 --> 00:00:08,343
Joseph Stalin had
a research program

3
00:00:08,345 --> 00:00:09,961
to create
supersoldiers

4
00:00:09,963 --> 00:00:13,531
by having women
impregnated by gorillas.

5
00:00:14,450 --> 00:00:16,968
What a sick use
of science.

6
00:00:16,970 --> 00:00:19,220
Hey, as long as
the baby's healthy.

7
00:00:20,773 --> 00:00:22,941
I wonder if Stalin considered
any other animals.

8
00:00:22,943 --> 00:00:24,976
Hippos are
the deadliest creature.

9
00:00:24,978 --> 00:00:28,062
A half-human, half-hippo soldier
would be pretty badass.

10
00:00:29,281 --> 00:00:31,232
Yes, but when they're
hungry-hungry,

11
00:00:31,234 --> 00:00:33,151
you can stop them
with marbles.

12
00:00:34,487 --> 00:00:35,570
Yeah, the correct animal

13
00:00:35,572 --> 00:00:38,206
for interspecies supersolider
is koala.

14
00:00:38,208 --> 00:00:42,710
You would wind up with an army
so cute it couldn't be attacked.

15
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:46,631
But half-man, half-owl
could fly...

16
00:00:46,633 --> 00:00:50,218
The answer is cuddly soldiers
with big flat noses. Moving on.

17
00:00:51,337 --> 00:00:52,887
So, Penny, when's
the new job start?

18
00:00:52,889 --> 00:00:54,088
Next Monday.

19
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:55,557
Did you get a chance
to look over

20
00:00:55,559 --> 00:00:56,508
the materials I gave you?

21
00:00:56,510 --> 00:00:57,675
Uh, not yet,
but I will.

22
00:00:57,677 --> 00:00:59,894
Great. When?

23
00:00:59,896 --> 00:01:02,013
I said I'll get to it.

24
00:01:05,651 --> 00:01:08,803
I'm sensing awkwardness,
am I right?

25
00:01:08,805 --> 00:01:10,772
Yes.

26
00:01:10,774 --> 00:01:12,941
Swish.

27
00:01:13,859 --> 00:01:15,860
I don't want to be pushy,

28
00:01:15,862 --> 00:01:18,613
but you've never done
pharmaceutical sales before.

29
00:01:18,615 --> 00:01:21,032
It seems like you could use
this time to get a head start.

30
00:01:21,034 --> 00:01:22,534
PENNY: Well, the first few
weeks will be all training.

31
00:01:22,536 --> 00:01:25,203
They'll tell me everything
I need to know.

32
00:01:25,205 --> 00:01:26,754
But imagine how impressed
they'd be if you showed up

33
00:01:26,756 --> 00:01:28,173
already familiar
with the material.

34
00:01:28,175 --> 00:01:30,708
Okay, so what, you want me
to be like a teacher's pet?

35
00:01:30,710 --> 00:01:32,844
Couldn't hurt.

36
00:01:32,846 --> 00:01:33,711
LEONARD:
Mm, I don't know.

37
00:01:33,713 --> 00:01:35,463
Who here has ever been hurt

38
00:01:35,465 --> 00:01:37,215
because they were
the teacher's pet?

39
00:01:41,353 --> 00:01:43,721
It was like the rest of
the class wanted Ms. McDonald

40
00:01:43,723 --> 00:01:45,473
to forget the quiz.

00:02:08,468 --> 00:02:14,468
== sync, corrected by elderman ==
@elder_man

51
00:02:16,182 --> 00:02:17,149
Mrs. Davis.

52
00:02:17,151 --> 00:02:19,251
(knocking)
Guess who?

53
00:02:19,253 --> 00:02:20,519
Dr. Cooper.

54
00:02:20,521 --> 00:02:22,687
That's right, good job.

55
00:02:23,539 --> 00:02:25,190
Hello.

56
00:02:25,192 --> 00:02:27,359
Uh, you wanted
to see me?

57
00:02:27,361 --> 00:02:28,977
Yes. Uh, welcome back.

58
00:02:28,979 --> 00:02:30,412
Thank you.

59
00:02:30,414 --> 00:02:33,031
I assume you'd like
to reopen our dialogue

60
00:02:33,033 --> 00:02:35,867
about the university forcing me
to continue with string theory?

61
00:02:35,869 --> 00:02:37,519
You mean the dialogue that went,

62
00:02:37,521 --> 00:02:41,006
"Please?"No."Please?"No."
"Please?"No."

63
00:02:41,908 --> 00:02:44,009
That's the one.

64
00:02:45,311 --> 00:02:48,630
I believe you went last,
so, uh, please?

65
00:02:48,632 --> 00:02:52,384
Dr. Cooper, while you were away,
we came up with a solution

66
00:02:52,386 --> 00:02:54,803
that would allow you to change
your field of study.

67
00:02:54,805 --> 00:02:56,555
Wow.

68
00:02:56,557 --> 00:02:59,691
Pouting and running away
actually worked.

69
00:03:00,593 --> 00:03:02,527
Yeah, I must say,
that may not be a lesson

70
00:03:02,529 --> 00:03:03,895
you want to reinforce with me.

71
00:03:05,531 --> 00:03:07,566
So, um, what is the solution?

72
00:03:07,568 --> 00:03:09,234
Currently, you're being paid
under a grant

73
00:03:09,236 --> 00:03:11,203
to specifically research
string theory.

74
00:03:11,205 --> 00:03:13,155
If we promote you
to junior professor,

75
00:03:13,157 --> 00:03:14,873
you'll be able to choose

76
00:03:14,875 --> 00:03:16,758
whatever field of research
you'd like.

77
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:21,980
But if I'm a professor,
then I'll have to teach a class.

78
00:03:21,982 --> 00:03:23,448
That is correct.

79
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:29,421
So your solution is to
promote me and pay me more money

80
00:03:29,423 --> 00:03:31,306
so that I can impart
my knowledge

81
00:03:31,308 --> 00:03:33,341
to the next generation
of scientists?

82
00:03:33,343 --> 00:03:34,709
Yes.

83
00:03:35,995 --> 00:03:38,096
You people are sick.

84
00:03:41,567 --> 00:03:43,151
(knocks)
PENNY: Hey.

85
00:03:43,153 --> 00:03:44,519
Ready to go to lunch?

86
00:03:44,521 --> 00:03:45,854
Just give me a minute.

87
00:03:45,856 --> 00:03:47,239
I'm stimulating the pleasure
cells of this starfish.

88
00:03:47,241 --> 00:03:48,440
I just need to turn it off.

89
00:03:48,442 --> 00:03:50,408
What happens
if you don't?

90
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:51,760
Then I have to sit through lunch

91
00:03:51,762 --> 00:03:54,446
knowing this starfish is
having a better day than I am.

92
00:03:55,531 --> 00:03:57,916
Is Bernadette meeting us
at the restaurant?

93
00:03:57,918 --> 00:04:00,852
Uh, no. Actually,
I didn't invite her.

94
00:04:00,854 --> 00:04:01,953
How come?

95
00:04:01,955 --> 00:04:04,122
Well, ever since she helped me
get this job,

96
00:04:04,124 --> 00:04:05,590
she won't stop bugging me.

97
00:04:05,592 --> 00:04:08,260
Well, I think she just wants you
to do well,

98
00:04:08,262 --> 00:04:09,544
and she's worried that you won't

99
00:04:09,546 --> 00:04:13,882
'cause you were just
a stunningly poor waitress.

100
00:04:13,884 --> 00:04:15,183
That is not true.

101
00:04:15,185 --> 00:04:16,902
I'm still waiting
on my mini corndogs

102
00:04:16,904 --> 00:04:19,020
from two years ago.

103
00:04:19,022 --> 00:04:22,574
I told you,
they'll be right out.

104
00:04:23,342 --> 00:04:26,027
Okay, so no
Bernadette.

105
00:04:26,029 --> 00:04:28,613
Well, you saw her the
other night. Am I wrong?

106
00:04:28,615 --> 00:04:29,814
No, I just...

107
00:04:29,816 --> 00:04:32,701
I feel kind of uncomfortable
talking about her like this.

108
00:04:32,703 --> 00:04:35,704
Usually when someone's being
talked about behind their back,

109
00:04:35,706 --> 00:04:38,490
it's me and it's right
in front of my face.

110
00:04:38,492 --> 00:04:41,626
I-I'm sorry. I just need
a little break from her.

111
00:04:41,628 --> 00:04:43,662
I understand.

112
00:04:43,664 --> 00:04:47,666
You know, there is
some research that indicates

113
00:04:47,668 --> 00:04:50,835
that sharing negative attitudes
about a third party

114
00:04:50,837 --> 00:04:53,972
can be a powerful bonding force
between two friends.

115
00:04:55,391 --> 00:04:56,841
So, what are
you saying?

116
00:04:56,843 --> 00:04:59,561
I'm saying,
in the spirit of science,

117
00:04:59,563 --> 00:05:01,980
what is
that little skank's problem?

118
00:05:05,484 --> 00:05:07,602
So, I've been trying
to come up

119
00:05:07,604 --> 00:05:09,521
with a cute couple's nickname
for me and Emily.

120
00:05:09,523 --> 00:05:11,189
What do you
like better—

121
00:05:11,191 --> 00:05:14,492
Emippali...

122
00:05:14,494 --> 00:05:17,028
or Koothrapemily?

123
00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:20,732
Why is it your last name
and her first name?

124
00:05:20,734 --> 00:05:22,701
Oh, well,
her last name is Sweeney,

125
00:05:22,703 --> 00:05:27,038
and something just didn't seem
right about Koothrapeeney.

126
00:05:28,874 --> 00:05:31,626
Hey, how'd it go
with human resources?

127
00:05:31,628 --> 00:05:33,044
Awful.

128
00:05:33,046 --> 00:05:35,380
Yeah, they're allowing me
to move on from string theory,

129
00:05:35,382 --> 00:05:37,299
but they made me
a junior professor

130
00:05:37,301 --> 00:05:39,601
and are requiring me
to teach a class.

131
00:05:39,603 --> 00:05:42,387
I don't understand. Why is it
bad that you have to teach?

132
00:05:42,389 --> 00:05:44,856
What a stupid question.

133
00:05:45,691 --> 00:05:49,227
The kids are
gonna love him.

134
00:05:49,229 --> 00:05:51,196
I can't believe
I have to waste my time

135
00:05:51,198 --> 00:05:53,365
babysitting a bunch
of grad students

136
00:05:53,367 --> 00:05:57,369
who probably think dark matter
is what's in their diapers.

137
00:05:57,371 --> 00:05:58,903
This might not be that bad.

138
00:05:58,905 --> 00:06:01,072
Uh, you like telling people
they're wrong.

139
00:06:01,074 --> 00:06:02,407
Wrong!

140
00:06:03,826 --> 00:06:06,911
Just because I enjoyed that one
doesn't mean I always do.

141
00:06:07,663 --> 00:06:09,464
You enjoy giving
people grades.

142
00:06:09,466 --> 00:06:13,585
A valid point,
but unoriginal— B-minus.

143
00:06:13,587 --> 00:06:15,754
And you love the sound
of your own voice.

144
00:06:15,756 --> 00:06:17,505
Yeah, well, of course I do.

145
00:06:17,507 --> 00:06:18,640
Listen to it.

146
00:06:18,642 --> 00:06:21,926
It's like an earful
of melted caramel.

147
00:06:21,928 --> 00:06:24,145
Look, most importantly,

148
00:06:24,147 --> 00:06:27,015
this will let you move on
and study dark matter.

149
00:06:28,134 --> 00:06:30,935
It is true that many of
my heroes have taken students

150
00:06:30,937 --> 00:06:32,237
under their wings:

151
00:06:32,239 --> 00:06:35,573
Feynman, Einstein, Professor X.

152
00:06:35,575 --> 00:06:38,026
Humorously,

153
00:06:38,028 --> 00:06:39,527
in the case of Professor X,

154
00:06:39,529 --> 00:06:41,946
some of his students
actually had wings.

155
00:06:41,948 --> 00:06:44,199
That's rich.

156
00:06:45,434 --> 00:06:47,352
I'll use that one
to lighten the mood

157
00:06:47,354 --> 00:06:50,455
after my entire class
fails the midterm.

158
00:06:53,959 --> 00:06:57,178
Measuring starfish
serotonin levels in response

159
00:06:57,180 --> 00:07:01,299
to one point two molar
stimulation of pleasure cells.

160
00:07:03,069 --> 00:07:06,004
You like that, don't you?

161
00:07:06,006 --> 00:07:07,772
That's right, say my name.

162
00:07:07,774 --> 00:07:11,493
(Skype ringtone playing)

163
00:07:11,495 --> 00:07:13,561
Hey.

164
00:07:13,563 --> 00:07:15,313
Hey, what's going on?
Not much.

165
00:07:15,315 --> 00:07:16,731
You want to get a drink later?

166
00:07:16,733 --> 00:07:17,949
Just the two of us?

167
00:07:17,951 --> 00:07:18,951
No Penny?

168
00:07:18,952 --> 00:07:20,034
Not tonight.

169
00:07:20,036 --> 00:07:21,236
I'm a little frustrated
with her.

170
00:07:21,238 --> 00:07:23,121
Because you got her the job
and you think

171
00:07:23,123 --> 00:07:24,989
she should be working harder
to prepare for it?

172
00:07:24,991 --> 00:07:28,660
So it's not just me.
You see it, too!

173
00:07:30,162 --> 00:07:33,164
I do, I see it.

174
00:07:33,166 --> 00:07:34,783
It's driving me crazy.

175
00:07:34,785 --> 00:07:36,634
Just this afternoon,
I saw on Instagram

176
00:07:36,636 --> 00:07:39,053
that instead of studying,
she went out to lunch

177
00:07:39,055 --> 00:07:40,805
and got a manicure.

178
00:07:41,707 --> 00:07:44,342
That's outrageous!

179
00:07:44,344 --> 00:07:45,510
I know!

180
00:07:45,512 --> 00:07:46,845
If she doesn't do well,

181
00:07:46,847 --> 00:07:49,464
Th-this could reflect poorly
on you.

182
00:07:49,466 --> 00:07:52,867
Exactly. Does she not realize it
or does she not care?

183
00:07:52,869 --> 00:07:54,085
I don't know.

184
00:07:54,087 --> 00:07:56,488
The important thing is
I am here for you

185
00:07:56,490 --> 00:08:00,692
so we can mutually disparage
this unpleasing third party.

186
00:08:05,915 --> 00:08:08,550
Hey. We just wanted to see

187
00:08:08,552 --> 00:08:10,285
how your class was going.
Where is everybody?

188
00:08:10,287 --> 00:08:12,837
There is no class.

189
00:08:12,839 --> 00:08:16,090
Did you send everyone to
the principal's office already?

190
00:08:17,626 --> 00:08:19,377
No one signed up.

191
00:08:19,379 --> 00:08:21,095
Well, that's not your fault.

192
00:08:21,097 --> 00:08:24,432
I called the department
secretary to see what happened.

193
00:08:24,434 --> 00:08:28,436
Apparently, I have a reputation
for being obnoxious.

194
00:08:29,271 --> 00:08:31,823
What?

195
00:08:32,775 --> 00:08:34,843
Hey, Sheldon, I'm sorry.

196
00:08:34,845 --> 00:08:36,861
No, it's fine.

197
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:41,199
Now I can devote all my time
to dark matter.

198
00:08:41,201 --> 00:08:44,202
Aw, you brought cookies
for everyone?

199
00:08:44,204 --> 00:08:45,570
Oh, yes. Fig Newtons.

200
00:08:45,572 --> 00:08:48,323
I was going to ask them:
which scientist both helped

201
00:08:48,325 --> 00:08:51,743
to develop calculus and had
a famous cookie named after him?

202
00:08:51,745 --> 00:08:53,211
And then after
someone said "Newton,"

203
00:08:53,213 --> 00:08:55,580
I was going to tell them
they're wrong.

204
00:08:57,066 --> 00:09:00,251
The cookies are named
after a town in Massachusetts.

205
00:09:00,253 --> 00:09:03,054
And then I'd throw
the cookies away.

206
00:09:04,673 --> 00:09:06,674
Hey, what if I took your class?

207
00:09:07,510 --> 00:09:09,594
Why would you do that?

208
00:09:09,596 --> 00:09:11,596
Yeah, why would you do that?
What's wrong with you?

209
00:09:12,147 --> 00:09:14,482
I'm thinking about
getting my doctorate,

210
00:09:14,484 --> 00:09:16,150
and he wants to teach— why not?

211
00:09:16,152 --> 00:09:17,819
Oh, Howard.

212
00:09:17,821 --> 00:09:19,938
I appreciate
the gesture,

213
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:22,607
but this is
a graduate-level physics class.

214
00:09:23,909 --> 00:09:25,610
I don't think you'd understand

215
00:09:25,612 --> 00:09:28,663
a single thing
I was talking about.

216
00:09:29,615 --> 00:09:32,500
Ask why not again;
I've got an answer.

217
00:09:32,502 --> 00:09:36,254
Sheldon, I'm more than smart
enough to take your class.

218
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:40,375
(chuckles):
No.

219
00:09:41,877 --> 00:09:43,094
Yes.

220
00:09:44,597 --> 00:09:46,681
How would you determine
the ground state

221
00:09:46,683 --> 00:09:49,801
of a quantum system
with no exact solution?

222
00:09:49,803 --> 00:09:52,270
I would guess a wave-function
and then vary its parameters

223
00:09:52,272 --> 00:09:54,105
until I found
the lowest energy solution.

224
00:09:54,107 --> 00:09:56,274
Hmm.

225
00:09:57,276 --> 00:09:59,861
Do you know how to integrate
X squared times E

226
00:09:59,863 --> 00:10:02,063
to the minus X,
without looking it up?

227
00:10:03,315 --> 00:10:04,365
I'd use Feynman's trick—

228
00:10:04,367 --> 00:10:05,800
differentiate
under the integral sign.

229
00:10:05,802 --> 00:10:08,152
Okay.

230
00:10:08,988 --> 00:10:10,488
Um...

231
00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:12,874
What is the correct
interpretation

232
00:10:12,876 --> 00:10:14,375
of quantum mechanics?

233
00:10:14,377 --> 00:10:16,377
Since every interpretation gives
exactly the same answer

234
00:10:16,379 --> 00:10:18,329
to every measurement,
they are all equally correct.

235
00:10:18,331 --> 00:10:20,665
However, I know you believe in
the Many Worlds Interpretation,

236
00:10:20,667 --> 00:10:23,301
so I'll say that. Now do you
think I'm smart enough?

237
00:10:26,472 --> 00:10:28,222
(chuckles):
No.

238
00:10:29,675 --> 00:10:31,426
Oh, come on.
You might've gone to school

239
00:10:31,428 --> 00:10:33,478
for a couple more years than me,
but guess what—

240
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:35,513
engineers are just
as smart as physicists.

241
00:10:35,515 --> 00:10:38,016
(gasps)
You take that back!

242
00:10:40,936 --> 00:10:43,655
(mimicking Sheldon):
No.

243
00:10:51,882 --> 00:10:53,332
So, after drinks
with Bernadette,

244
00:10:53,334 --> 00:10:56,335
I get home, and Penny calls
to complain about her.

245
00:10:56,337 --> 00:10:57,970
And then while
I'm talking to Penny,

246
00:10:57,972 --> 00:10:59,388
I get a text from Bernadette.

247
00:10:59,390 --> 00:11:02,341
Wh... I'm trying to prepare
my lesson plan for Howard.

248
00:11:02,343 --> 00:11:05,394
Why are you
telling me this?

249
00:11:05,396 --> 00:11:09,515
Because it's taken 15 years, but
high school is finally awesome!

250
00:11:11,435 --> 00:11:13,186
I love them both,

251
00:11:13,188 --> 00:11:17,073
but I'm in the center now,
and I love that even more.

252
00:11:17,075 --> 00:11:19,859
Amy, please. I am trying
to figure out a way

253
00:11:19,861 --> 00:11:23,863
to intellectually emasculate
a dear friend of mine.

254
00:11:23,865 --> 00:11:26,165
But I'm just...
Not now.

255
00:11:26,167 --> 00:11:27,833
You better watch
that attitude, buddy.

256
00:11:27,835 --> 00:11:31,003
You're dating the
popular girl now.

257
00:11:34,041 --> 00:11:35,841
Hmm. You're up late.

258
00:11:35,843 --> 00:11:38,544
Oh, I'm working on
my lesson plan for Wolowitz.

259
00:11:38,546 --> 00:11:40,429
He is going to be so lost.

260
00:11:41,548 --> 00:11:43,466
Look at this section over here.

261
00:11:43,468 --> 00:11:46,802
Even I don't really
understand it.

262
00:11:46,804 --> 00:11:49,772
Sheldon, why are you doing this?

263
00:11:49,774 --> 00:11:51,524
I'm a teacher, Leonard.

264
00:11:51,526 --> 00:11:52,858
It's my job.

265
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:54,727
No, I-I mean,

266
00:11:54,729 --> 00:11:56,562
why are you going
to so much trouble

267
00:11:56,564 --> 00:11:58,364
to prove that you're smarter
than Wolowitz?

268
00:11:58,366 --> 00:12:01,484
Oh, it's no trouble;
it's actually a pleasure.

269
00:12:02,319 --> 00:12:04,453
You want to know what I think?

270
00:12:04,455 --> 00:12:07,540
I think the idea that someone
could be as smart as you,

271
00:12:07,542 --> 00:12:10,126
or even smarter,
scares the pants off you,

272
00:12:10,128 --> 00:12:11,794
and you can't deal with it.

273
00:12:13,630 --> 00:12:15,464
Interesting point.

274
00:12:15,466 --> 00:12:17,333
Wh... You're
suggesting

275
00:12:17,335 --> 00:12:20,002
that I have emotional issues
below my consciousness

276
00:12:20,004 --> 00:12:21,654
which drive my behavior,

277
00:12:21,656 --> 00:12:24,640
thus causing me to lash out
at anything or anyone

278
00:12:24,642 --> 00:12:27,209
that threatens
my intellectual superiority.

279
00:12:27,211 --> 00:12:29,845
Might be something
to think about.

280
00:12:30,731 --> 00:12:32,098
Leonard?

281
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:33,683
Yeah.

282
00:12:33,685 --> 00:12:35,351
Howard's allergic to peanuts.

283
00:12:35,353 --> 00:12:37,436
How can I use that against him?

284
00:12:41,408 --> 00:12:42,742
Hey.

285
00:12:42,744 --> 00:12:46,696
Okay, now that everyone's here,
we can begin.

286
00:12:48,448 --> 00:12:51,267
Before we do,
I just talked to Leonard.

287
00:12:51,269 --> 00:12:52,535
And if you're gonna

288
00:12:52,537 --> 00:12:55,121
spend all your time
trying to belittle me

289
00:12:55,123 --> 00:12:58,007
by making this class
unnecessarily hard,

290
00:12:58,009 --> 00:12:59,959
then I'm out.

291
00:12:59,961 --> 00:13:01,377
But if you're interested
in making

292
00:13:01,379 --> 00:13:04,130
a sincere effort
to be a good teacher,

293
00:13:04,132 --> 00:13:06,932
then I'm willing
to give this a shot.

294
00:13:09,469 --> 00:13:12,021
I suppose that's a fair request.

295
00:13:12,023 --> 00:13:15,474
There's no reason we both can't
benefit from this experience.

296
00:13:15,476 --> 00:13:17,043
Okay.

297
00:13:17,045 --> 00:13:19,111
Okay.

298
00:13:19,113 --> 00:13:20,813
Well, then, uh,
first things first.

299
00:13:20,815 --> 00:13:24,567
Um, are you familiar with
the Brachistochrone problem?

300
00:13:24,569 --> 00:13:26,035
I am.
Good.

301
00:13:26,037 --> 00:13:28,621
And how it relates
to the calculus of variations?

302
00:13:28,623 --> 00:13:29,989
It's an inverted cycloid.

303
00:13:29,991 --> 00:13:31,157
Wonderful.

304
00:13:31,159 --> 00:13:33,459
Now, what about
Euler-Lagrange theorems?

305
00:13:33,461 --> 00:13:34,794
That's where I'm a little fuzzy.

306
00:13:34,796 --> 00:13:36,829
Ha! I knew it! All right.

307
00:13:38,298 --> 00:13:41,334
We have a lot of information
to cover before your first test.

308
00:13:41,336 --> 00:13:44,170
Which, by the way,
is in eight minutes.

309
00:13:44,172 --> 00:13:46,806
The good news is I'm
grading on a curve,

310
00:13:46,808 --> 00:13:49,508

guaranteed a C.

then I'm gonna be

This is not American Bandstand.

323
00:14:11,833 --> 00:14:12,782
Okay.

324
00:14:12,784 --> 00:14:13,866
Now, where was I?

325
00:14:13,868 --> 00:14:14,817
Let's see.

326
00:14:14,819 --> 00:14:15,835
Oh, yes. Over here.

327
00:14:15,837 --> 00:14:17,036
You...

328
00:14:18,505 --> 00:14:19,955
What are you doing now?

329
00:14:19,957 --> 00:14:21,774
Making a straw.

330
00:14:21,776 --> 00:14:22,825
Why?

331
00:14:22,827 --> 00:14:26,178
So I can shoot you
with a spitball.

332
00:14:27,464 --> 00:14:30,216
You're not going to do that,
and I'll tell you why.

333
00:14:30,218 --> 00:14:32,385
This is an institution
of higher learning,

334
00:14:32,387 --> 00:14:34,053
I am your professor,

335
00:14:34,055 --> 00:14:36,021
and you're going to treat me
with the prop...

336
00:14:36,023 --> 00:14:37,690
(gasps)

337
00:14:41,361 --> 00:14:44,647
You shot your spit in my mouth!

338
00:14:45,482 --> 00:14:47,233
Is that gonna be on the test?

339
00:14:47,235 --> 00:14:49,485
Because I don't think
I can do that again.

340
00:14:52,205 --> 00:14:54,156
Hey, girlfriend.

341
00:14:54,158 --> 00:14:57,410
Can I get a what what?

342
00:14:57,412 --> 00:14:59,378
What?

343
00:15:00,213 --> 00:15:01,547
Close enough.

344
00:15:01,549 --> 00:15:04,216
Um, I was just calling to see
what you were up tonight.

345
00:15:04,218 --> 00:15:06,335
Thought maybe we could hit up
Color Me Mine,

346
00:15:06,337 --> 00:15:09,672
maybe sneak in
some Pinot Greej. Whatevs.

347
00:15:09,674 --> 00:15:11,590
Uh, thanks, but I think
I'm gonna stay in

348
00:15:11,592 --> 00:15:13,426
and go over the stuff
Bernadette gave me.

349
00:15:13,428 --> 00:15:15,377
Oh. Oh, I hear you.

350
00:15:15,379 --> 00:15:17,963
Try and get that nag
off your back, right?

351
00:15:19,166 --> 00:15:20,533
I mean, you're not a bicycle;

352
00:15:20,535 --> 00:15:23,018
why's she riding you like that?

353
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:25,137
No, I think she was
just trying to help.

354
00:15:25,139 --> 00:15:27,907
Plus, I really want to do well
at this job. So...

355
00:15:27,909 --> 00:15:29,542
Okay, good luck.
And call me later,

356
00:15:29,544 --> 00:15:32,411
you know, if you decide
she's a bitch or something.

357
00:15:37,534 --> 00:15:39,618
Hey, girlfriend.

358
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:41,070
Hey, Amy.

359
00:15:41,072 --> 00:15:42,455
Tonight. You, me, Color Me Mine.

360
00:15:42,457 --> 00:15:46,625
Maybe we sneak in some Pinot—
make it Color Me Wine.

361
00:15:46,627 --> 00:15:48,928
That sounds fun,
but I promised Penny

362
00:15:48,930 --> 00:15:50,296
I'd come by and help her study.

363
00:15:50,298 --> 00:15:53,098
Oh. Well, good luck
getting her to do that.

364
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:55,768
She's probably off
getting another manicure.

365
00:15:55,770 --> 00:15:57,436
You remember when she did that?

366
00:15:57,438 --> 00:15:59,755
You remember?

367
00:15:59,757 --> 00:16:01,974
I was probably being
too hard on her.

368
00:16:01,976 --> 00:16:03,275
We talked, we're good.

369
00:16:03,277 --> 00:16:04,894
Oh. Great.

370
00:16:04,896 --> 00:16:06,412
I'm happy for you guys.

371
00:16:06,414 --> 00:16:08,197
You know, when the two of you
aren't getting along,

372
00:16:08,199 --> 00:16:11,283
it puts me in a really
weird position.

373
00:16:11,285 --> 00:16:13,469
Well, don't worry—
everything's back to normal.

374
00:16:13,471 --> 00:16:16,572
You mean, like, where she's nice
to your face? Okay got it. Bye.

375
00:16:20,544 --> 00:16:22,645
Hey, boyfriend.

376
00:16:22,647 --> 00:16:24,163
Can't talk. Spitball.

377
00:16:24,165 --> 00:16:25,965
Probably gonna die.

378
00:16:25,967 --> 00:16:27,166
(gargling)

379
00:16:32,806 --> 00:16:34,139
Well?

380
00:16:34,141 --> 00:16:36,008
Sheldon, I-I promise.

381
00:16:36,010 --> 00:16:39,311
Your uvula does not have an STD.

382
00:16:41,064 --> 00:16:43,148
Are you sure?

383
00:16:43,150 --> 00:16:47,186
It just doesn't feel as
innocent as it used to.

384
00:16:48,989 --> 00:16:51,407
You reported me
to human resources?

385
00:16:51,409 --> 00:16:55,361
You violated the sanctity
of my mouth.

386
00:16:55,363 --> 00:16:58,664
Well, I dropped your class,
so I hope you're happy.

387
00:16:58,666 --> 00:17:01,333
I told you you weren't
smart enough to take it.

388
00:17:01,335 --> 00:17:02,284
I'm smart enough, Sheldon.

389
00:17:02,286 --> 00:17:03,369
Asking me a bunch of questions

390
00:17:03,371 --> 00:17:04,587
about a topic
I'm not familiar with

391
00:17:04,589 --> 00:17:05,538
doesn't prove anything.

392
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:06,705
I could do the same to you.

393
00:17:06,707 --> 00:17:08,173
Yeah... Try me.

394
00:17:08,175 --> 00:17:10,759
Okay.
(scoffs)

395
00:17:10,761 --> 00:17:14,380
You enjoy making fun
of engineering so much;

396
00:17:14,382 --> 00:17:17,466
how do you quantify
the strength of materials?

397
00:17:17,468 --> 00:17:19,084
Young's modulus.

398
00:17:19,086 --> 00:17:20,653
Is that right?

399
00:17:20,655 --> 00:17:22,922
Yeah.

400
00:17:24,257 --> 00:17:27,860
Okay, how do you prevent
eddy currents in a transformer?

401
00:17:27,862 --> 00:17:30,112
Laminate the core material.

402
00:17:30,114 --> 00:17:31,196
Come on, give
him a hard one.

403
00:17:31,198 --> 00:17:33,065
That was a hard one.

404
00:17:34,234 --> 00:17:35,901
All right.

405
00:17:35,903 --> 00:17:39,488
How does the flow rate in a pipe
depend on its diameter?

406
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:43,709
You don't know, do you?

407
00:17:44,744 --> 00:17:45,794
(panting)

408
00:17:45,796 --> 00:17:47,212
What's the matter, smart guy?

409
00:17:47,214 --> 00:17:49,548
Don't know Poiseuille's law?

410
00:17:49,550 --> 00:17:51,734
(coughing)

411
00:17:55,221 --> 00:17:58,591
(gasps)
Thank goodness I got it!

412
00:18:01,044 --> 00:18:03,729
Now I can quit
checking my stool.

413
00:18:07,601 --> 00:18:10,352
Okay, what are the
potential side effects

414
00:18:10,354 --> 00:18:12,454
for our erectile
dysfunction drug?

415
00:18:12,456 --> 00:18:14,940
Headaches, dizziness and nausea.

416
00:18:14,942 --> 00:18:16,075
Yes.

417
00:18:16,077 --> 00:18:17,409
Those are also the side effects

418
00:18:17,411 --> 00:18:19,578
of having a 75-year-old man
with an erection

419
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:21,280
climb on top of you.

420
00:18:21,282 --> 00:18:23,282
Want to stop here?

421
00:18:23,284 --> 00:18:24,617
Uh, no.
I can keep going.

422
00:18:24,619 --> 00:18:25,818
Nah, you got this.

423
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:27,286
Let's go for a drink.
I'll call Amy.

424
00:18:27,288 --> 00:18:30,322
Okay, good. She seemed like she
really wanted to go out tonight.

425
00:18:34,094 --> 00:18:36,295
(ringtone playing)

426
00:18:39,099 --> 00:18:41,216
Hey, girl.

427
00:18:49,667 --> 00:18:53,703
Okay, next question,
for the Butterfinger:

428
00:18:53,705 --> 00:18:56,389
how long is a galactic yea

429
00:18:56,391 --> 00:18:57,707
250 million years!

430
00:18:57,709 --> 00:18:58,291
Yes!

431
00:18:58,293 --> 00:19:01,211
(all cheering)

432
00:19:01,213 --> 00:19:05,548
Okay, this one is
for a Cadbury Creme Egg.

433
00:19:05,550 --> 00:19:07,384
(gasps)
It's not even Easter time.

434
00:19:07,386 --> 00:19:09,552
This is crazy!

435
00:19:10,721 --> 00:19:15,025
Which Archimedean solid
has 20 regular triangular faces,

436
00:19:15,027 --> 00:19:17,627
30 square faces,
12 pentagonal faces,

437
00:19:17,629 --> 00:19:21,348
60 vertices and 120 edges?

438
00:19:21,350 --> 00:19:23,733
ALL:
The Rhombicosidodecahedron!

439
00:19:23,735 --> 00:19:24,317
Yes!

440
00:19:24,319 --> 00:19:27,037
(all cheering)

441
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:28,738
We are so smart!

442
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:30,457
Why didn't girls like us
in high school?

443
00:19:30,459 --> 00:19:32,586
Because we were awkward and
weird and couldn't play sports!

444
00:19:32,610 --> 00:19:33,741
Right again!

445
00:19:33,742 --> 00:19:35,175
(all cheering)

446
00:19:35,176 --> 00:19:41,176
