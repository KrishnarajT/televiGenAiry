1
00:00:03,115 --> 00:00:05,216
What color would you like to be?

2
00:00:05,218 --> 00:00:08,052
Well, I'd like to be green,
but you know you always take it.

3
00:00:08,054 --> 00:00:09,353
That's not true.

4
00:00:09,355 --> 00:00:10,988
Any color's fine with me.

5
00:00:10,990 --> 00:00:14,291
Yeah, I could be a-a combination
of blue and yellow.

6
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:17,428
Blue and yellow make green.

7
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:19,263
Well, then it's settled.

8
00:00:20,599 --> 00:00:21,999
Hi. Ready to go?

9
00:00:22,001 --> 00:00:24,235
Oh, good news, we ordered lunch,

10
00:00:24,237 --> 00:00:27,104
so we can all stay here
and play Lord of the Rings Risk.

11
00:00:27,106 --> 00:00:30,908
Sheldon, we said that we would
play games with you tonight.

12
00:00:30,910 --> 00:00:32,309
Oh, no, we'll still
be playing it tonight—

13
00:00:32,311 --> 00:00:34,945
this game can easily
take eight hours.

14
00:00:34,947 --> 00:00:36,647
Sweetie, you really thought
I'd want to do this?

15
00:00:36,649 --> 00:00:38,215
No.
Well, did you tell him that?

16
00:00:38,217 --> 00:00:41,151
Yes.
Did you say it out loud with words?

17
00:00:41,153 --> 00:00:43,654
No.

18
00:00:43,656 --> 00:00:46,223
I don't want to spend the whole
day playing a board game.

19
00:00:46,225 --> 00:00:48,192
Yeah, well, you may change
your mind when you hear

20
00:00:48,194 --> 00:00:50,594
that this is the
new expanded edition

21
00:00:50,596 --> 00:00:52,830
which contains a more
complete map of Middle Earth,

22
00:00:52,832 --> 00:00:55,099
now including
the Haradwaith Territories.

23
00:00:57,569 --> 00:00:59,269
I will literally
race you to the car.

24
00:00:59,271 --> 00:01:02,372
No, no, no, come on,
don't leave. Just try it.

25
00:01:02,374 --> 00:01:04,141
No. We're always doing
what you guys want.

26
00:01:04,143 --> 00:01:06,643
Just once, it'd be nice
if you did something we wanted.

27
00:01:06,645 --> 00:01:09,480
You want to be green?

28
00:01:10,615 --> 00:01:12,683
You know, they
really have tried to like

29
00:01:12,685 --> 00:01:15,085
a lot of the same stuff we're into.
Yeah, we do game

30
00:01:15,087 --> 00:01:17,387
nights and video game
nights and we watch movies

31
00:01:17,389 --> 00:01:18,655
with director's commentary.

32
00:01:18,657 --> 00:01:20,590
Oh, my favorite—
George Lucas can talk

33
00:01:20,592 --> 00:01:22,693
all the way through
Star Wars, I say one word

34
00:01:22,695 --> 00:01:24,127
and I'm banished
to the kitchen.

35
00:01:25,463 --> 00:01:27,130
Yeah, today Amy and I
are deciding

36
00:01:27,132 --> 00:01:28,298
what we're all gonna do.

37
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:30,333
You got it, you girls
are in charge.

38
00:01:30,335 --> 00:01:32,302
Thank you.
Sheldon?

39
00:01:32,304 --> 00:01:34,471
Fine.

40
00:01:34,473 --> 00:01:36,873
Now that we're not playing,
you can be green.

41
00:01:36,875 --> 00:01:38,341
Thank you.
And since you're green

42
00:01:38,343 --> 00:01:40,477
this time, I can
be it next time.

43
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:42,412
All right, let's see.
What's something fun

44
00:01:42,414 --> 00:01:44,447
the guys would
never take us to do?

45
00:01:44,449 --> 00:01:46,249
Oh, I know— we could
go horseback riding.

46
00:01:46,251 --> 00:01:47,450
I actually can't.

47
00:01:47,452 --> 00:01:50,720
My hips don't open
wider than 22 degrees.

48
00:01:52,556 --> 00:01:55,792
I rode a very
thin pony once.

49
00:01:55,794 --> 00:01:59,229
On the first bump...
just popped right off.

50
00:02:00,698 --> 00:02:02,398
All right, well,
what do you want to do?

51
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:05,235
There's a craft and folk
art museum on Wilshire.

52
00:02:05,237 --> 00:02:07,704
Well, that's Wilshire's problem.

53
00:02:08,572 --> 00:02:10,039
Come on, you know, there-there's

54
00:02:10,041 --> 00:02:12,175
got to be something fun we could
do that the guys will hate.

55
00:02:12,177 --> 00:02:14,244
Hang on, why do we
have to hate it?

56
00:02:14,246 --> 00:02:17,480
Three words:
Doctor Who convention.

57
00:02:17,482 --> 00:02:19,849
I-I did not force you
to go to that.

58
00:02:19,851 --> 00:02:22,051
You walked out of the house
in a fez and bow tie. I went

59
00:02:22,053 --> 00:02:24,020
so you didn't get beat up.

60
00:02:24,022 --> 00:02:25,555
I wasn't gonna get beat up.

61
00:02:25,557 --> 00:02:28,958
You were, but somehow
I held myself back.

62
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:31,427
You know what you could
make us do? Ice-skating.

63
00:02:31,429 --> 00:02:33,796
The cold air will trigger
Leonard's asthma

64
00:02:33,798 --> 00:02:35,798
and it plays right into
my well-known fear of

65
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:39,035
getting flattened by a Zamboni.

66
00:02:39,037 --> 00:02:42,071
Now you're helping them
find ways to make us miserable?

67
00:02:42,073 --> 00:02:45,575
Well, I'm sorry, Leonard, I'm a
problem-solver, it's what I do.

68
00:02:45,577 --> 00:02:47,944
I actually can't
go ice-skating.

69
00:02:47,946 --> 00:02:51,314
I have unnaturally
brittle ankles.

70
00:02:51,316 --> 00:02:53,849

== sync, corrected by elderman ==
@elder_man

81
00:03:26,922 --> 00:03:28,890
Oh, my God, oh, my
God, oh, my God.

82
00:03:28,892 --> 00:03:31,693
Will you please relax?
I can't take it, dude.

83
00:03:31,695 --> 00:03:33,828
You okay?
No, I'm not okay. I feel like

84
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:35,630
I'm gonna jump out of my skin.

85
00:03:35,632 --> 00:03:38,199
I told you
not to wax down there.

86
00:03:39,334 --> 00:03:43,638
It's itchy when it grows back.

87
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:47,141
I'm worried about
the New Horizons space probe.

88
00:03:47,143 --> 00:03:48,109
What's he talking about?

89
00:03:48,111 --> 00:03:50,478
Nine years ago
he was part of a team

90
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,747
that launched a spacecraft
to collect data about Pluto.

91
00:03:52,749 --> 00:03:54,682
It's finally close enough, so

92
00:03:54,684 --> 00:03:56,784
this morning
it turned itself on.

93
00:03:56,786 --> 00:03:58,019
We hope.

94
00:03:58,021 --> 00:03:59,954
The signal has to travel
over three billion miles.

95
00:03:59,956 --> 00:04:02,356
So it's gonna be hours before
we know if it even survived.

96
00:04:02,358 --> 00:04:04,892
Now we get to see him flip out
because he's worried

97
00:04:04,894 --> 00:04:06,427
it was demolished by space ice.

98
00:04:06,429 --> 00:04:08,629
Space ice is no joke.

99
00:04:09,498 --> 00:04:11,932
I can't even watch
Frozen anymore.

100
00:04:14,803 --> 00:04:17,972
Ooh, the philharmonic
is playing Beethoven downtown.

101
00:04:17,974 --> 00:04:19,540
Yeah, well, before
you say yes,

102
00:04:19,542 --> 00:04:22,810
it's not the movie
about the big dog.

103
00:04:25,881 --> 00:04:28,148
How come we can't think
of something we both want to do?

104
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:30,417
Because you always
pick what we do

105
00:04:30,419 --> 00:04:31,885
and I just
go along with it.

106
00:04:31,887 --> 00:04:33,253
Ah, interesting—

107
00:04:33,255 --> 00:04:35,222
we're being accused of
making you do things

108
00:04:35,224 --> 00:04:36,623
you don't like,
and here you are,

109
00:04:36,625 --> 00:04:38,292
doing the same
thing to poor Amy.

110
00:04:38,294 --> 00:04:40,994
You should point out
the hypocrisy of that.

111
00:04:44,799 --> 00:04:46,233
That's what I was doing.

112
00:04:47,435 --> 00:04:49,937
Oh, that wasn't clear.

113
00:04:49,939 --> 00:04:51,738
Try it again, but this time
drive it home

114
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:55,342
with, “How do you like
them apples, Missy?”

115
00:04:55,344 --> 00:04:57,044
All right,
keep thinking.

116
00:04:57,046 --> 00:04:59,346
You're making it
too complicated.

117
00:04:59,348 --> 00:05:00,480
Why not stick
to the basics?

118
00:05:00,482 --> 00:05:01,982
Go shopping for clothes

119
00:05:01,984 --> 00:05:03,350
while Leonard and I sit in those

120
00:05:03,352 --> 00:05:05,919
uncomfortable chairs
and hold your purses, hmm?

121
00:05:05,921 --> 00:05:07,187
I know I'd hate that.

122
00:05:07,189 --> 00:05:08,355
Leonard?

123
00:05:08,357 --> 00:05:10,690
Well, yeah.

124
00:05:10,692 --> 00:05:13,794
Well, then, it's settled?

125
00:05:13,796 --> 00:05:15,829
What do you say?
Sounds kind of perfect.

126
00:05:15,831 --> 00:05:17,431
It does— somehow he managed

127
00:05:17,433 --> 00:05:20,000
to take all the fun out of it.

128
00:05:20,002 --> 00:05:22,169
Well, once again,
it's what I do.

129
00:05:24,672 --> 00:05:27,374
Oh, another two hours to go.

130
00:05:27,376 --> 00:05:29,075
The wait
is killing me.

131
00:05:29,077 --> 00:05:31,878
I know. I get it. When I was
in the Soyuz capsule

132
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:34,514
returning from the space
station, plummeting toward Earth

133
00:05:34,516 --> 00:05:36,650
at 17,000 miles per hour...
Before you finish,

134
00:05:36,652 --> 00:05:39,586
is this a story about
patience and waiting

135
00:05:39,588 --> 00:05:42,722
or just another reminder
that you went to space?

136
00:05:44,658 --> 00:05:46,893
A story can
do two things.

137
00:05:46,895 --> 00:05:48,828
Ugh, I feel like I'm gonna
have a heart attack.

138
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:50,830
You work in
pharmaceuticals—

139
00:05:50,832 --> 00:05:53,399
don't you have
anything you can give him?

140
00:05:53,401 --> 00:05:56,402
All I have is our new
urine flow drug.

141
00:05:57,771 --> 00:06:00,607
Won't help with his anxiety,
but it's so strong, when he pees

142
00:06:00,609 --> 00:06:03,109
he'll fly around the room
like he's got a jet pack.

143
00:06:04,778 --> 00:06:07,513
I can't stop thinking about it.

144
00:06:07,515 --> 00:06:09,975
You know, worrying won't
have any effect on what happens.

145
00:06:09,976 --> 00:06:10,979
I know.

146
00:06:11,003 --> 00:06:13,075
Maybe you need to do
something more productive.

147
00:06:13,722 --> 00:06:15,888
Okay.

148
00:06:15,890 --> 00:06:17,890
Ah.

149
00:06:17,892 --> 00:06:20,793
If I make this shot

150
00:06:20,795 --> 00:06:22,128
in the trash can,

151
00:06:22,130 --> 00:06:24,363
the probe will have arrived

152
00:06:24,365 --> 00:06:27,500
in perfect working order.

153
00:06:27,502 --> 00:06:29,402
So, in addition to being crazy,
you're resting the fate

154
00:06:29,404 --> 00:06:32,738
of the mission
on your athletic prowess.

155
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:34,240
Yes.

156
00:06:34,242 --> 00:06:37,009
The man who crashed
his stationary bike.

157
00:06:38,211 --> 00:06:40,313
I didn't crash it, okay?

158
00:06:40,315 --> 00:06:41,847
My playlist was too up-tempo,

159
00:06:41,849 --> 00:06:44,283
I got light-headed
and I fell off.

160
00:06:45,686 --> 00:06:47,486
Okay.

161
00:06:48,321 --> 00:06:49,889
It all...

162
00:06:49,891 --> 00:06:52,058
comes down...

163
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:54,093
to this.

164
00:06:56,363 --> 00:06:59,331
You happy? Now you can relax.

165
00:06:59,333 --> 00:07:00,866
What kind of scientist are you?
Everyone knows

166
00:07:00,868 --> 00:07:02,635
you got to make
two out of three.

167
00:07:10,277 --> 00:07:12,611
This isn't so bad.

168
00:07:12,613 --> 00:07:14,646
That's easy for you to say.

169
00:07:14,648 --> 00:07:17,649
Your chair's not
facing the lingerie section.

170
00:07:18,618 --> 00:07:21,754
Boy, that's a lot of panties.

171
00:07:21,756 --> 00:07:24,756
You guys comfy?
This might take a while.

172
00:07:24,758 --> 00:07:26,258
You know, I don't
understand why women

173
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:28,026
insist on making
a big production

174
00:07:28,028 --> 00:07:29,394
out of buying clothes.

175
00:07:29,396 --> 00:07:31,130
No, you're right,
we should do what you do.

176
00:07:31,132 --> 00:07:34,666
Have our mom send us pants
from the Walmart in Houston.

177
00:07:35,802 --> 00:07:37,169
They have a man there

178
00:07:37,171 --> 00:07:39,538
who understands
my personal style.

179
00:07:40,607 --> 00:07:41,807
Bye.

180
00:07:41,809 --> 00:07:44,042
Uh, I've got some bad news.

181
00:07:44,044 --> 00:07:45,978
There's no cell service in here.

182
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:47,946
Oh.

183
00:07:47,948 --> 00:07:49,581
Well, that's all right.

184
00:07:49,583 --> 00:07:51,450
There were plenty of ways
to pass the time

185
00:07:51,452 --> 00:07:53,318
before smart phones
were invented.

186
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:54,886
That's true.

187
00:07:54,888 --> 00:07:57,089
I'll look them up.

188
00:07:59,592 --> 00:08:02,194
Son of a biscuit.

189
00:08:02,196 --> 00:08:04,196
Sheldon, it's fine.

190
00:08:04,198 --> 00:08:05,397
No, it's not fine.

191
00:08:05,399 --> 00:08:06,898
What kind of store
in the 21st century

192
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:08,300
doesn't at least have Wi-Fi?

193
00:08:08,302 --> 00:08:09,834
I'm going to call
their corporate office...

194
00:08:09,836 --> 00:08:11,736
Son of a biscuit!

195
00:08:20,512 --> 00:08:23,614
Let's see, my armies

196
00:08:23,616 --> 00:08:26,116
are going
to attack the Shire

197
00:08:26,118 --> 00:08:27,484
from Buckland.

198
00:08:27,486 --> 00:08:29,653
And I roll...

199
00:08:34,426 --> 00:08:36,126
a five and a three.

200
00:08:36,128 --> 00:08:37,561
Okay.

201
00:08:37,563 --> 00:08:42,065
And to defend, I roll...

202
00:08:42,067 --> 00:08:44,268
two sixes. I win.

203
00:08:44,270 --> 00:08:47,471
Boy, double-sixes again.

204
00:08:47,473 --> 00:08:48,939
You know...
if I hadn't seen it

205
00:08:48,941 --> 00:08:50,908
with my own eyes,
I wouldn't believe it.

206
00:08:52,210 --> 00:08:55,178
I wonder how long
we're gonna be stuck here.

207
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:56,880
I don't know, but the girls
do a lot for us.

208
00:08:56,882 --> 00:08:58,281
It's the least we can do.

209
00:08:58,283 --> 00:09:00,283
Oh, that's true.
I suppose it's only fair

210
00:09:00,285 --> 00:09:01,818
we make compromises.

211
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:04,254
Look at you,
being all mature.

212
00:09:04,256 --> 00:09:08,291
I don't know why
you're so surprised.

213
00:09:08,293 --> 00:09:10,093
If there's one thing I know
about after living with you

214
00:09:10,095 --> 00:09:13,196
for so many years,
it's how to compromise.

215
00:09:14,131 --> 00:09:15,999
I-I'm sorry?

216
00:09:16,001 --> 00:09:18,268
You make compromises for me?

217
00:09:19,604 --> 00:09:21,538
All the time.

218
00:09:22,607 --> 00:09:24,374
On Earth?

219
00:09:26,877 --> 00:09:28,878
In our lives?

220
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:32,415
That-That we're living?

221
00:09:32,417 --> 00:09:34,951
Oh, yes. I...

222
00:09:34,953 --> 00:09:38,021
Just yesterday, you had
a-a big piece of lettuce

223
00:09:38,023 --> 00:09:39,689
stuck in your teeth at lunch.

224
00:09:39,691 --> 00:09:43,259
Did I say anything? No.

225
00:09:44,428 --> 00:09:46,196
I compromised

226
00:09:46,198 --> 00:09:48,431
and kept my mouth shut.

227
00:09:48,433 --> 00:09:52,035
Like you should've, because
everyone was laughing at you.

228
00:09:52,037 --> 00:09:55,038
That is not
a compromise.

229
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:57,140
A compromise is me
driving you everywhere

230
00:09:57,142 --> 00:09:58,741
because you refuse to learn how.

231
00:09:58,743 --> 00:10:01,144
Oh, I learned how.
Amy taught me.

232
00:10:01,146 --> 00:10:03,179
What? Then-Then why
don't you do it?

233
00:10:03,181 --> 00:10:06,315
Uh, well, it's scary.

234
00:10:06,317 --> 00:10:10,486
And sometimes
I get the pedals mixed up.

235
00:10:11,388 --> 00:10:14,257
But, more importantly,
driving me to work

236
00:10:14,259 --> 00:10:17,193
is one of the things
that gives your life purpose.

237
00:10:19,029 --> 00:10:20,663
I can't take that away from you,

238
00:10:20,665 --> 00:10:23,633
so... what do I do?

239
00:10:25,135 --> 00:10:27,436
Oh, come on, I'm practically
feeding you the answer.

240
00:10:27,438 --> 00:10:30,406
I compromise.

241
00:10:32,542 --> 00:10:34,989
Hey, uh, thanks for
keeping me company.

242
00:10:35,013 --> 00:10:35,979
I'm happy to.

243
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:38,514
I think getting out of
the apartment will do you good.

244
00:10:38,516 --> 00:10:41,083
So... where we headed?

245
00:10:41,085 --> 00:10:43,652
If it's okay with you,
I'd like to go to temple.

246
00:10:43,654 --> 00:10:48,424
Buddy, trust me, you don't want
to convert to Judaism.

247
00:10:49,192 --> 00:10:50,793
I mean, I know I make it
look cool,

248
00:10:50,795 --> 00:10:55,664
but... it's not all briskets
and dreidels.

249
00:10:55,666 --> 00:10:58,100
I meant a Hindu temple.

250
00:10:58,102 --> 00:11:00,970
Oh. Okay.

251
00:11:00,972 --> 00:11:03,605
It's not like Indiana Jones
and the Temple of Doom, right?

252
00:11:03,607 --> 00:11:07,576
Some bald guy with horns
isn't gonna rip my heart out.

253
00:11:07,578 --> 00:11:09,945
Dude, that movie's
an imperialist fantasy

254
00:11:09,947 --> 00:11:13,382
that makes the followers of a
beautiful and peaceful religion

255
00:11:13,384 --> 00:11:15,818
look like a bunch
of bloodthirsty barbarians.

256
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:16,785
You love that movie.

257
00:11:16,787 --> 00:11:19,555
Yeah, it's pretty great.

258
00:11:22,158 --> 00:11:25,027
I'm surprised to see you
suddenly get religious.

259
00:11:25,029 --> 00:11:26,295
Why?

260
00:11:26,297 --> 00:11:29,064
Well, because I've known you
for ten years

261
00:11:29,066 --> 00:11:30,766
and you've never gone to temple,

262
00:11:30,768 --> 00:11:32,567
you never talked
about believing in God,

263
00:11:32,569 --> 00:11:36,838
and last Diwali I watched you
eat two pounds of sacred cow

264
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:40,008
at a Brazilian steak house.

265
00:11:40,010 --> 00:11:42,844
Religion is
a very personal thing.

266
00:11:42,846 --> 00:11:45,447
I do go to temple—
I just... I don't talk about it.

267
00:11:45,449 --> 00:11:46,982
Yeah, but you're
a scientist.

268
00:11:46,984 --> 00:11:48,049
So?

269
00:11:48,051 --> 00:11:49,451
So, as a scientist,
you believe the way

270
00:11:49,453 --> 00:11:51,586
to understand the universe
is through facts and evidence,

271
00:11:51,588 --> 00:11:52,654
and now
you're counting

272
00:11:52,656 --> 00:11:54,356
on some blue chick

273
00:11:54,358 --> 00:11:56,558
with a hundred arms to help you?

274
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,894
That is so offensive.
Does everything you know

275
00:11:58,896 --> 00:12:00,495
about Hinduism come
from Indiana Jones?

276
00:12:00,497 --> 00:12:03,932
No. There's also Apu
from The Simpsons.

277
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:08,436
Well, lots of scientists
believe in God.

278
00:12:08,438 --> 00:12:11,272
Okay? Newton,
uh, Faraday,

279
00:12:11,274 --> 00:12:12,941
uh, Pascal— all were believers.

280
00:12:12,943 --> 00:12:15,710
Even Einstein was famous
for attacking quantum theory

281
00:12:15,712 --> 00:12:18,079
on the grounds
that “God does not play dice

282
00:12:18,081 --> 00:12:19,414
with the universe.”
Well, of course

283
00:12:19,416 --> 00:12:23,218
he believed in God—
he slept with Marilyn Monroe.

284
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:25,019
Actually
there's no proof of that.

285
00:12:25,021 --> 00:12:27,755
You believe in your religion,
I'll believe in mine.

286
00:12:30,493 --> 00:12:32,060
How's it going
in there?

287
00:12:32,062 --> 00:12:33,062
Eh.

288
00:12:33,063 --> 00:12:35,930
Not really a great outfit
for work,

289
00:12:35,932 --> 00:12:40,468
unless something opens up in
the hookers and whores division.

290
00:12:40,470 --> 00:12:43,438
Hey, can I ask you something?
Sure.

291
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:46,207
Do I really force you
to do things you don't want to?

292
00:12:46,209 --> 00:12:48,142
Yeah, but it's okay.

293
00:12:48,144 --> 00:12:49,377
How is it okay?

294
00:12:49,379 --> 00:12:51,779
I promised myself,
if I ever got friends,

295
00:12:51,781 --> 00:12:54,015
I'd do whatever they said.

296
00:12:55,050 --> 00:12:58,286
Really, I'm lucky you found me
before a cult did.

297
00:12:58,288 --> 00:13:01,122
Well, you know,
that was a long time ago.

298
00:13:01,124 --> 00:13:03,891
You're a different woman now.
You're smart,

299
00:13:03,893 --> 00:13:06,594
you've got great friends,
you've got a boyfriend,

300
00:13:06,596 --> 00:13:10,564
you're pretty, you have
zero fashion sense, but...

301
00:13:10,566 --> 00:13:13,034
Anyway, tonight we're gonna do
whatever you want.

302
00:13:13,036 --> 00:13:14,068
Really?

303
00:13:14,070 --> 00:13:16,337
Absolutely.
You name it, we're doing it.

304
00:13:17,139 --> 00:13:20,541
Basket weaving
at the craft museum.

305
00:13:20,543 --> 00:13:24,278
Well, you named it.

306
00:13:28,016 --> 00:13:29,850
Oh, here's another one.

307
00:13:29,852 --> 00:13:33,821
I wish that the apple pancake
mix was on the top shelf

308
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:35,522
because it starts with an “A,”

309
00:13:35,524 --> 00:13:37,324
but I don't put it there

310
00:13:37,326 --> 00:13:39,526
because I don't want you
breaking one of your little legs

311
00:13:39,528 --> 00:13:41,962
when you're supposed
to be making my breakfast.

312
00:13:43,265 --> 00:13:47,334
Is it my turn to talk
about the compromises I make?

313
00:13:47,336 --> 00:13:51,739
I wasn't done, but go ahead.

314
00:13:51,741 --> 00:13:55,409
He said, compromising.

315
00:13:55,411 --> 00:13:57,344
Because of you, I'm not allowed

316
00:13:57,346 --> 00:13:59,379
to adjust the temperature
in my own home.

317
00:13:59,381 --> 00:14:00,848
I'm not allowed to whistle.

318
00:14:00,850 --> 00:14:03,150
I don't wear shoes
that might squeak.

319
00:14:03,152 --> 00:14:05,819
Well, you're a physicist,
not a circus clown.

320
00:14:05,821 --> 00:14:10,224
Sheldon, do you realize I don't
live with the woman I love

321
00:14:10,226 --> 00:14:11,858
because of you?

322
00:14:12,794 --> 00:14:14,194
No other reason. Just you.

323
00:14:14,196 --> 00:14:16,663
Is that true?
Yes, it's true. The last time

324
00:14:16,665 --> 00:14:18,065
I brought it up,
you had an emotional breakdown

325
00:14:18,067 --> 00:14:21,068
and got on a train and ran away.

326
00:14:21,070 --> 00:14:22,836
Well, given my history
on the subject,

327
00:14:22,838 --> 00:14:25,706
it seems a little reckless
to bring it up now.

328
00:14:25,708 --> 00:14:30,010
You have no idea
how much you inconvenience

329
00:14:30,012 --> 00:14:31,645
the lives of everyone
around you.

330
00:14:31,647 --> 00:14:33,580
It's exhausting!

331
00:14:33,582 --> 00:14:35,048
You know what?

332
00:14:35,050 --> 00:14:37,050
You think you're so tolerant,

333
00:14:37,052 --> 00:14:39,019
but the truth is...

334
00:14:39,021 --> 00:14:41,087
you're mean to me a lot.

335
00:14:41,089 --> 00:14:42,489
Yeah,
you think

336
00:14:42,491 --> 00:14:44,157
that I don't notice
all those sarcastic comments

337
00:14:44,159 --> 00:14:46,559
and those eye rolls,
but I do. Hmm?

338
00:14:46,561 --> 00:14:49,195
I have
excellent peripheral vision.

339
00:14:50,498 --> 00:14:54,434
On a good day,
I can see my ears.

340
00:14:55,436 --> 00:14:58,138
Sheldon, I-I'm sorry
if I hurt your feelings.

341
00:14:58,140 --> 00:15:00,940
I've been holding a lot
of this in for a while.

342
00:15:00,942 --> 00:15:02,609
Well, I'm sorry, too.
And if you want

343
00:15:02,611 --> 00:15:05,278
to live with Penny,
then I think you should.

344
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:06,713
Do you mean that?

345
00:15:06,715 --> 00:15:09,082
Yes. Yeah, just put
on your squeaky shoes and...

346
00:15:09,084 --> 00:15:11,751
your way out of my life.

347
00:15:14,388 --> 00:15:16,389
Come on, don't get upset.

348
00:15:16,391 --> 00:15:18,524
I'm not upset.

349
00:15:18,526 --> 00:15:23,796
I'm just imagining a world
without my best friend in it.

350
00:15:24,898 --> 00:15:26,132
Sheldon.

351
00:15:26,134 --> 00:15:27,100
It's okay.

352
00:15:27,102 --> 00:15:29,936
I-I'm not leaving your world.

353
00:15:29,938 --> 00:15:32,772
I'm just talking
about living across the hall.

354
00:15:32,774 --> 00:15:34,040
I understand.

355
00:15:34,042 --> 00:15:36,642
Either way,
I want you to know that...

356
00:15:36,644 --> 00:15:38,778
I'm aware of how difficult
I can be.

357
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:40,413
So I just want
to say...

358
00:15:40,415 --> 00:15:44,717
thank you
for putting up with me.

359
00:15:44,719 --> 00:15:47,153
Buddy...

360
00:15:50,724 --> 00:15:52,058
How are you guys
getting alo...?

361
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:54,460
What? Why are
there tears?

362
00:15:54,462 --> 00:15:56,095
Everything's fine.

363
00:15:56,097 --> 00:15:58,764
We just started talking
about living arrangements.

364
00:15:58,766 --> 00:16:02,501
Are you crazy? You know
he's a flight risk.

365
00:16:02,503 --> 00:16:06,372
That's exactly
what I told him.

366
00:16:06,374 --> 00:16:08,474
Sheldon, we know this
is a sensitive subject,

367
00:16:08,476 --> 00:16:10,976
and Leonard's not gonna
move out until you're ready.

368
00:16:12,746 --> 00:16:15,948
Well, what if you did it
gradually?

369
00:16:16,816 --> 00:16:18,784
All right. Well...

370
00:16:18,786 --> 00:16:22,154
how about we start
with two nights a week

371
00:16:22,156 --> 00:16:23,622
I live with Penny?

372
00:16:23,624 --> 00:16:27,760
How about one night and...

373
00:16:27,762 --> 00:16:29,962
I let you whistle?

374
00:16:33,566 --> 00:16:35,367
Okay.

375
00:16:35,369 --> 00:16:37,336
When I'm not home.

376
00:16:38,171 --> 00:16:40,439
You got it.

377
00:16:41,307 --> 00:16:43,175
There we go,

378
00:16:43,177 --> 00:16:45,878
compromising again.

379
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:49,047
We really are the best.

380
00:16:56,055 --> 00:16:58,023
Here we go,

381
00:16:58,025 --> 00:16:59,658
my first
Hindu temple.

382
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:02,194
You see behind the
fountain, that tower

383
00:17:02,196 --> 00:17:03,995
that looks like a pyramid?

384
00:17:03,997 --> 00:17:05,998
It's called a Sikhara.
It symbolizes

385
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,967
the-the connection between
the human and the divine.

386
00:17:08,969 --> 00:17:09,935
Huh.

387
00:17:09,937 --> 00:17:12,404
I always thought
it was mini golf.

388
00:17:13,239 --> 00:17:15,106
All right. Shall we?

389
00:17:15,108 --> 00:17:18,877
Yeah. Just, uh, is there
anything I should know

390
00:17:18,879 --> 00:17:20,178
before I go in?

391
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:21,379
Like what?

392
00:17:21,381 --> 00:17:24,149
Like am I dressed okay?

393
00:17:24,151 --> 00:17:26,217
Really? So every other place
you've been,

394
00:17:26,219 --> 00:17:28,453
you thought this was fine?

395
00:17:28,455 --> 00:17:31,356
I know you're under a lot
of pressure,

396
00:17:31,358 --> 00:17:32,657
so I'm gonna let that pass.

397
00:17:32,659 --> 00:17:34,526
Sorry. You're right.

398
00:17:34,528 --> 00:17:36,361
I'm so stressed.

399
00:17:36,363 --> 00:17:38,129
But you know what,

400
00:17:38,131 --> 00:17:40,331
whenever I walk
into that temple

401
00:17:40,333 --> 00:17:42,700
I realize that whatever happens,
it's okay.

402
00:17:42,702 --> 00:17:44,836
We're all part of
an immense pattern,

403
00:17:44,838 --> 00:17:47,739
and though we can't understand
it, we can be happy to know

404
00:17:47,741 --> 00:17:50,241
that it's-it's working its will
through us.

405
00:17:50,243 --> 00:17:53,311
That's nice.

406
00:17:53,313 --> 00:17:55,547
Whether you call it God
or the universe or the self,

407
00:17:55,549 --> 00:17:58,917
we're all interconnected,
and that's just a beautiful...

408
00:17:58,919 --> 00:18:02,854
Son of a bitch!
That guy just dinged my car!

409
00:18:03,656 --> 00:18:05,957
S-Seriously?

410
00:18:05,959 --> 00:18:07,825
Y-You were
just gonna drive away?

411
00:18:07,827 --> 00:18:09,060
Like my life

412
00:18:09,062 --> 00:18:10,461
isn't hard enough right now.

413
00:18:10,463 --> 00:18:13,131
A space probe
might be destroyed,

414
00:18:13,133 --> 00:18:15,133
my parents are going
through an awful divorce,

415
00:18:15,135 --> 00:18:18,669
the guy who cuts my dog's hair
just gave her bangs!

416
00:18:18,671 --> 00:18:20,738
Raj.

417
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:24,041
You saw her. She looks like
Jim Carrey from Dumb and Dumber!

418
00:18:24,043 --> 00:18:26,744
Raj, you just
got a text.

419
00:18:26,746 --> 00:18:29,180
The probe turned
on. It's fine.

420
00:18:29,948 --> 00:18:32,683
Oh, good.

421
00:18:33,518 --> 00:18:36,320
Namaste, Grandpa.

422
00:18:44,096 --> 00:18:46,330
I thought
this was gonna be boring,

423
00:18:46,332 --> 00:18:47,932
but it's actually kind of fun.

424
00:18:47,934 --> 00:18:51,969
Don't tell Amy that. We'll
be here every Sunday.

425
00:18:51,971 --> 00:18:54,638
Sheldon, that really is
an excellent basket.

426
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,407
It's not a basket.

427
00:18:56,409 --> 00:19:00,010
It's a soldier's helmet
from 16th century China.

428
00:19:03,348 --> 00:19:04,915
Very nice.

429
00:19:04,917 --> 00:19:08,118
Yeah, it
looks great.

430
00:19:09,454 --> 00:19:12,623
I saw that.

431
00:19:22,793 --> 00:19:26,162
Well, roomie,
it's only one night a week,

432
00:19:26,164 --> 00:19:27,264
but it's a start.

433
00:19:27,266 --> 00:19:29,299
I know. I'm really
proud of Sheldon.

434
00:19:29,301 --> 00:19:31,167
Yeah, I'm proud of him, too.

435
00:19:31,169 --> 00:19:32,869
Can you keep it
down? Some of us

436
00:19:32,871 --> 00:19:34,169
are trying
to sleep out here.

437
00:19:36,512 --> 00:19:43,012
