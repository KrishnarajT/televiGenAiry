1
00:00:03,380 --> 00:00:06,464
Hey, I read
that someone invented a way

2
00:00:06,466 --> 00:00:08,883
to convert your footsteps
into electromagnetic energy

3
00:00:08,885 --> 00:00:10,802
so you can charge
your cell phone while walking.

4
00:00:10,804 --> 00:00:13,054
We had that idea years ago.

5
00:00:13,056 --> 00:00:14,922
How come we never
did anything with it?

6
00:00:14,924 --> 00:00:17,425
Probably because we left the
diagram of it in the restaurant,

7
00:00:17,427 --> 00:00:19,861
and none of us
wanted to walk back.

8
00:00:19,863 --> 00:00:23,731
I know the real reason you never
made progress with that idea.

9
00:00:23,733 --> 00:00:25,183
You thought of it

10
00:00:25,185 --> 00:00:27,235
September 22, 2007.

11
00:00:27,237 --> 00:00:29,604
Two days later, Penny moved in,

12
00:00:29,606 --> 00:00:31,773
and so much blood rushed
to your genitals,

13
00:00:31,775 --> 00:00:33,691
your brain became a ghost town.

14
00:00:35,412 --> 00:00:37,395
That's not what happened.

15
00:00:37,397 --> 00:00:39,113
I remember it distinctly

16
00:00:39,115 --> 00:00:41,416
because I had just
composed my annual poem

17
00:00:41,418 --> 00:00:44,369
commemorating the anniversary
of Dr. Seuss's death.

18
00:00:44,371 --> 00:00:45,620
No one wants
to hear it.

19
00:00:45,622 --> 00:00:47,121
Why, die.

20
00:00:47,123 --> 00:00:48,673
Why did he die?

21
00:00:48,675 --> 00:00:50,008
Old, told.

22
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:51,959
I was told he was old.

23
00:00:51,961 --> 00:00:55,263
Penny is not the reason
I didn't pursue that idea.

24
00:00:55,265 --> 00:00:57,382
Oh, really?
Since meeting her,

25
00:00:57,384 --> 00:00:59,550
what have been
your greatest accomplishments?

26
00:00:59,552 --> 00:01:00,685
Easy.

27
00:01:00,687 --> 00:01:02,687
Sleeping with Penny.

28
00:01:02,689 --> 00:01:05,473
Getting Penny to go back out
with him after she dumped him.

29
00:01:05,475 --> 00:01:07,809
Tricking Penny
into getting engaged.

30
00:01:07,811 --> 00:01:10,978
And a few weeks ago,
he almost did a pull-up.

31
00:01:12,065 --> 00:01:15,133
I think
someone owes me an apology.

32
00:01:15,135 --> 00:01:17,485
Well, don't feel bad.

33
00:01:17,487 --> 00:01:19,620
I think we've all
been distracted

34
00:01:19,622 --> 00:01:21,439
since the girls
entered our lives.

35
00:01:21,441 --> 00:01:23,241
You admit Amy's a distraction?

36
00:01:23,243 --> 00:01:25,827
Oh, very much so.
Listen to this.

37
00:01:25,829 --> 00:01:27,829
This is from two days ago.

38
00:01:27,831 --> 00:01:30,498
“Hi. Hope you're having
a good day.”

39
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:33,034
Who has time
for this constant sexting?

40
00:01:33,837 --> 00:01:37,338
Well, maybe
we have lost our focus.

41
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:40,975
It wouldn't kill us to get
together and brainstorm ideas.

42
00:01:40,977 --> 00:01:43,511
Ooh, we could have one
of those retreats.

43
00:01:43,513 --> 00:01:44,896
Like our own science retreat.

44
00:01:44,898 --> 00:01:47,148
My cousin has a cabin
out in the woods.

45
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:49,517
I'm not going to a
cabin in the woods.

46
00:01:49,519 --> 00:01:52,770
Did you see the movie
Cabin in the Woods?

47
00:01:52,772 --> 00:01:54,072
Then we'll go to a hotel.

48
00:01:54,074 --> 00:01:57,241
A hotel?
Did you see The Shining?

49
00:01:57,243 --> 00:01:59,160
We could go up

50
00:01:59,162 --> 00:02:01,412
to Big Bear
and get a house on the lake.

51
00:02:01,414 --> 00:02:04,031
Did you see
The Lake House?

52
00:02:04,033 --> 00:02:06,367
Nothing bad happens
in The Lake House.

53
00:02:06,369 --> 00:02:09,737
Yeah, well, no,
not to them. To me.

54
00:02:09,739 --> 00:02:10,872
Time traveling mailbox.

55
00:02:10,874 --> 00:02:12,090
The only time that traveled

56
00:02:12,092 --> 00:02:14,792
was an hour and half
of my life down the toilet.

57
00:02:14,794 --> 00:02:16,594
Fine. Then we'll just stay here
and do it.

58
00:02:16,596 --> 00:02:18,296
Well, you didn't suggest
a beach house.

59
00:02:18,298 --> 00:02:19,647
You would go to a beach house?

60
00:02:19,649 --> 00:02:22,016
Well, good Lord, no—

@elder_man

71
00:02:52,309 --> 00:02:53,925
Hey.
Hey.

72
00:02:53,927 --> 00:02:55,560
So, the guys and
I are talking

73
00:02:55,562 --> 00:02:57,762
about having kind of a
science retreat this weekend.

74
00:02:57,764 --> 00:02:59,014
I just wanted to
know if that's okay.

75
00:02:59,016 --> 00:03:00,982
You and I had talked about
going to brunch on Sunday...

76
00:03:00,984 --> 00:03:02,434
Want to go to Vegas
this weekend?

77
00:03:02,436 --> 00:03:03,568
Of course I do.

78
00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:04,736
Bernadette?

79
00:03:04,738 --> 00:03:06,071
Girl's weekend.
Vegas. You in?

80
00:03:06,073 --> 00:03:07,656
Hell, yeah!
Yes!

81
00:03:07,658 --> 00:03:09,774
I'll check flights.
I'll check hotels.

82
00:03:09,776 --> 00:03:12,193
I'll check my underpants.
I'm so excited, I think I peed.

83
00:03:20,937 --> 00:03:23,121
They seem okay with it.

84
00:03:26,677 --> 00:03:28,843
Hey.

85
00:03:28,845 --> 00:03:30,762
Hey.
Hey. I didn't think you'd make it.

86
00:03:30,764 --> 00:03:32,263
Why not?
Well, 'cause you have

87
00:03:32,265 --> 00:03:33,798
a steady girlfriend now,
and we assumed

88
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:37,018
you'd have to stay home to lower
the food down to her in the pit.

89
00:03:41,558 --> 00:03:44,809
For your information,
Emily is working tonight.

90
00:03:44,811 --> 00:03:47,095
Yeah, one would assume,
on getting out of the pit.

91
00:03:49,149 --> 00:03:50,782
Okay, let's focus.

92
00:03:50,784 --> 00:03:52,701
The girls are gone,
we have 48 hours.

93
00:03:52,703 --> 00:03:55,036
There are no distractions.
Let's change the world.

94
00:03:55,038 --> 00:03:57,622
Thinking caps on.
Here we go.

95
00:03:57,624 --> 00:03:59,124
Ooh, this is exciting.
We're innovating.

96
00:03:59,126 --> 00:04:01,126
I feel like
we're in the Facebook movie.

97
00:04:01,128 --> 00:04:02,744
Oh. I never saw that.

98
00:04:02,746 --> 00:04:04,546
- Yeah. Really?
- Oh.

99
00:04:04,548 --> 00:04:06,664
It's wonderful, and I swear
I'm not saying that

100
00:04:06,666 --> 00:04:08,833
because Justin Timberlake
is in it.

101
00:04:10,003 --> 00:04:11,803
Yeah, I have it on Blu-ray.

102
00:04:11,805 --> 00:04:13,171
We should watch it.

103
00:04:13,173 --> 00:04:15,390
Cool. I'll make the popcorn.

104
00:04:16,226 --> 00:04:17,642
Guys...

105
00:04:17,644 --> 00:04:18,977
in 30 seconds, we went from

106
00:04:18,979 --> 00:04:21,362
“Let's change the world”
to “Let's watch TV.”

107
00:04:22,099 --> 00:04:24,966
I'm sorry. Is that a “no”?

108
00:04:24,968 --> 00:04:26,317
Okay. No.

109
00:04:26,319 --> 00:04:27,569
Leonard's right.
We're here to focus.

110
00:04:27,571 --> 00:04:29,654
Didn't we used
to have a list of all our ideas?

111
00:04:29,656 --> 00:04:31,356
I-I think I still have it.

112
00:04:31,358 --> 00:04:33,041
I did not get a clear answer.

113
00:04:33,043 --> 00:04:35,160
I'm gonna set this down now.

114
00:04:36,029 --> 00:04:37,746
Ah, here it is.

115
00:04:37,748 --> 00:04:39,414
Whoa.

116
00:04:39,416 --> 00:04:41,199
I haven't looked
at these in years.

117
00:04:41,201 --> 00:04:42,867
“Robot girlfriend.”

118
00:04:42,869 --> 00:04:45,170
Mm, that was mine.

119
00:04:45,172 --> 00:04:48,540
“Robot prostitute.”

120
00:04:48,542 --> 00:04:51,092
Also mine.

121
00:04:51,094 --> 00:04:52,360
Wait. I'm confused.

122
00:04:52,362 --> 00:04:54,312
Why would you need
both a robot girlfriend

123
00:04:54,314 --> 00:04:55,880
and a robot prostitute?

124
00:04:55,882 --> 00:04:57,549
There's just some things
you don't do

125
00:04:57,551 --> 00:04:59,167
with your robot girlfriend.

126
00:05:01,388 --> 00:05:03,054
Boy, when you met Bernadette,

127
00:05:03,056 --> 00:05:05,807
the field of robotics
really took a hit.

128
00:05:06,726 --> 00:05:07,942
Okay, let's just skip

129
00:05:07,944 --> 00:05:10,562
all the inventions
you can have sex with.

130
00:05:16,403 --> 00:05:18,536
All right, no— here we go:

131
00:05:18,538 --> 00:05:20,371
“Ergonomic heated seat cushion"

132
00:05:20,373 --> 00:05:21,906
No, it vibrates.
Keep going.

133
00:05:24,961 --> 00:05:27,378
You know, let's just come up
with something new.

134
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:28,713
You know,

135
00:05:28,715 --> 00:05:30,915
a number of significant
innovations have been inspired

136
00:05:30,917 --> 00:05:32,417
by science fiction.

137
00:05:32,419 --> 00:05:35,086
The-the geosynchronous satellite
from Arthur C. Clarke.

138
00:05:35,088 --> 00:05:38,256
The Motorola flip phone—
that came from Star Trek.

139
00:05:38,258 --> 00:05:40,592
Yeah, and I've long suspected
that the idea

140
00:05:40,594 --> 00:05:42,694
of an African-American president
was stolen

141
00:05:42,696 --> 00:05:45,446
from the movie Deep Impact.

142
00:05:46,433 --> 00:05:48,066
Hey,

143
00:05:48,068 --> 00:05:50,585
the future they show
in Back to the Future II

144
00:05:50,587 --> 00:05:52,320
is only a year away.

145
00:05:52,322 --> 00:05:54,856
A lot of the things in that
movie haven't been invented yet.

146
00:05:54,858 --> 00:05:56,074
How cool would that be

147
00:05:56,076 --> 00:05:57,609
if we could make
one of those a reality?

148
00:05:57,611 --> 00:05:59,694
If we could figure out
the scientific basis

149
00:05:59,696 --> 00:06:00,945
for Marty's hover board,

150
00:06:00,947 --> 00:06:03,381
that would have
universal application.

151
00:06:03,383 --> 00:06:05,617
Well, it's-it's possible
at absolute zero,

152
00:06:05,619 --> 00:06:06,768
but we would
have to remove

153
00:06:06,770 --> 00:06:08,453
the temperature restrictions.

154
00:06:08,455 --> 00:06:09,737
Oh, I have an idea.

155
00:06:09,739 --> 00:06:11,005
I think I have the same one.

156
00:06:11,007 --> 00:06:13,141
We got to watch
Back to the Future II!

157
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:17,178
I'll make the popcorn.

158
00:06:19,633 --> 00:06:21,182
So, where should
we go first?

159
00:06:21,184 --> 00:06:22,317
Ooh.

160
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:23,968
There's a cover band
in the lounge.

161
00:06:23,970 --> 00:06:26,037
Nah.
But they play Barry Manilow.

162
00:06:26,039 --> 00:06:29,991
No.
But they're called “Fairly Manilow"

163
00:06:30,894 --> 00:06:32,277
Oh. Okay.

164
00:06:32,279 --> 00:06:33,811
Great!
No!

165
00:06:34,731 --> 00:06:36,781
Well, what do you want
to do?

166
00:06:36,783 --> 00:06:38,116
Well, we're in Vegas.

167
00:06:38,118 --> 00:06:40,468
I want to go downstairs,
get a bucket of margaritas,

168
00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:42,654
dance until I vomit
all over a roulette wheel

169
00:06:42,656 --> 00:06:44,172
and watch it go everywhere.

170
00:06:45,492 --> 00:06:46,991
What if we don't want to vomit?

171
00:06:46,993 --> 00:06:49,911
Oh, you will. That's why
they give you the bucket.

172
00:06:51,081 --> 00:06:52,747
Uh-oh.
What?

173
00:06:52,749 --> 00:06:54,249
It's my boss.

174
00:06:54,251 --> 00:06:56,334
They moved my field ride
up to Monday.

175
00:06:56,336 --> 00:06:57,468
What does that mean?

176
00:06:57,470 --> 00:06:59,587
It means instead
of having a week to study,

177
00:06:59,589 --> 00:07:00,838
I only have two days.

178
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:01,973
That sucks.

179
00:07:01,975 --> 00:07:03,625
Can you start
in the morning?

180
00:07:03,627 --> 00:07:04,676
Uh, it's kind of a lot.

181
00:07:04,678 --> 00:07:06,344
You know,
let me do a little tonight,

182
00:07:06,346 --> 00:07:08,012
and I'll catch up
with you guys later.

183
00:07:08,014 --> 00:07:10,348
You sure?
Yeah, it's okay. Go ahead.

184
00:07:12,185 --> 00:07:14,152
So, um, now that
Penny's not coming...

185
00:07:14,154 --> 00:07:16,404
We're not seeing Fairly Manilow.
Okay.

186
00:07:23,947 --> 00:07:25,930
Hold on. Pause.

187
00:07:25,932 --> 00:07:28,116
Something doesn't make sense.
Look...

188
00:07:29,703 --> 00:07:32,337
In 2015, Biff steals
the sports almanac

189
00:07:32,339 --> 00:07:34,289
and takes the time machine

190
00:07:34,291 --> 00:07:38,126
back to 1955, to give it
to his younger self.

191
00:07:38,128 --> 00:07:41,296
But as soon as he does that,
he changes the future,

192
00:07:41,298 --> 00:07:43,631
so the 2015 he
returns to would be

193
00:07:43,633 --> 00:07:47,719
a different 2015, not the 2015
that Marty and Doc were in.

194
00:07:47,721 --> 00:07:50,738
This is Hot Tub Time Machine
all over again.

195
00:07:53,810 --> 00:07:56,060
If future Biff
goes back to 2015

196
00:07:56,062 --> 00:07:57,946
right after he gives
young Biff the almanac,

197
00:07:57,948 --> 00:08:01,065
he could get back to the 2015
with Marty and Doc in it.

198
00:08:01,067 --> 00:08:04,369
Because it wasn't until
his 21st birthday

199
00:08:04,371 --> 00:08:06,487
that 1955 Biff
placed his first bet.

200
00:08:06,489 --> 00:08:07,622
Wait. Whoa, whoa.

201
00:08:07,624 --> 00:08:09,374
Is “placed” right?

202
00:08:09,376 --> 00:08:10,291
What do you mean?

203
00:08:10,293 --> 00:08:12,460
Is “placed” the right tense

204
00:08:12,462 --> 00:08:14,662
for something that would have
happened in the future

205
00:08:14,664 --> 00:08:17,749
of a past that was affected
by something from the future?

206
00:08:17,751 --> 00:08:21,719
Had will have placed?

207
00:08:21,721 --> 00:08:24,255
That's my boy.

208
00:08:25,425 --> 00:08:29,310
Okay, so, it wasn't until
his 21st birthday

209
00:08:29,312 --> 00:08:31,346
that Biff had will have
placed his first bet

210
00:08:31,348 --> 00:08:32,764
and made his millions.

211
00:08:32,766 --> 00:08:34,899
That's when
he altered the timeline.

212
00:08:34,901 --> 00:08:37,618
Yeah, but he had will
haven't placed it!

213
00:08:38,905 --> 00:08:42,106
What?

214
00:08:42,108 --> 00:08:44,108
Unlike Hot Tub Time Machine,

215
00:08:44,110 --> 00:08:46,194
this couldn't be more simple.

216
00:08:46,196 --> 00:08:48,196
When Biff gets the almanac
in 1955,

217
00:08:48,198 --> 00:08:50,615
the alternate future
he creates isn't the one

218
00:08:50,617 --> 00:08:53,501
in which Marty and Doc Brown
ever use the time machine

219
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:54,836
to travel to 2015.

220
00:08:54,838 --> 00:08:55,787
Therefore,

221
00:08:55,789 --> 00:08:57,255
in the new timeline,

222
00:08:57,257 --> 00:08:59,257
Marty and Doc never brought
the time machine...

223
00:08:59,259 --> 00:09:00,341
W-Wait.

224
00:09:00,343 --> 00:09:01,926
Is “brought” right?

225
00:09:05,815 --> 00:09:10,284
Marty and Doc never
had have had brought?

226
00:09:11,137 --> 00:09:13,438
I don't know.
You did it to me.

227
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:16,024
Oh, I'm going with it.

228
00:09:16,026 --> 00:09:18,810
Marty and Doc never
had have had brought

229
00:09:18,812 --> 00:09:21,112
the time machine to 2015.

230
00:09:21,114 --> 00:09:23,698
That means 2015 Biff could also

231
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:27,652
not had have had brought
the almanac to 1955 Biff.

232
00:09:27,654 --> 00:09:32,323
Therefore, the timeline in which
1955 Biff gets the almanac

233
00:09:32,325 --> 00:09:33,825
is also the timeline

234
00:09:33,827 --> 00:09:36,661
in which 1955 Biff
never gets the almanac.

235
00:09:36,663 --> 00:09:38,496
And not just “never gets.”

236
00:09:38,498 --> 00:09:42,483
Never have, never hasn't,
never had have hasn't.

237
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:48,773
He's right.

238
00:09:50,677 --> 00:09:53,561
Also, what kind of name is Biff?

239
00:09:53,563 --> 00:09:56,130
Sounds like when you pop open
a can of Pillsbury dough.

240
00:09:56,132 --> 00:09:58,733
Biff.

241
00:10:00,236 --> 00:10:03,321
Oh, that stuff is so good
wrapped around cocktail weenies.

242
00:10:03,323 --> 00:10:04,272
Guys...

243
00:10:04,274 --> 00:10:05,490
Do you know that
the word “wiener”

244
00:10:05,492 --> 00:10:06,691
comes from the German name

245
00:10:06,693 --> 00:10:08,025
of the Austrian capital
Vienna, or “Wien”?

246
00:10:08,027 --> 00:10:10,361
Do you know if you look
at Austria on a map

247
00:10:10,363 --> 00:10:11,779
it actually looks like a wiener?

248
00:10:13,249 --> 00:10:14,449
Guys, what are
we doing?

249
00:10:14,451 --> 00:10:15,616
W-We sent the girls away

250
00:10:15,618 --> 00:10:16,834
so we could focus.

251
00:10:16,836 --> 00:10:19,954
I don't think it worked.

252
00:10:35,357 --> 00:10:39,593
Maybe after this, you'll be
in the mood for some Manilow.

253
00:10:39,595 --> 00:10:42,679
I think after this,
I'll be dead.

254
00:10:42,681 --> 00:10:44,714
Look at us out,

255
00:10:44,716 --> 00:10:46,600
while Penny's in
the room studying.

256
00:10:46,602 --> 00:10:47,851
I'm proud of her.

257
00:10:47,853 --> 00:10:48,985
This is a great opportunity.

258
00:10:48,987 --> 00:10:50,854
It's nice to see her take it
seriously.

259
00:10:50,856 --> 00:10:51,856
It is.

260
00:10:51,857 --> 00:10:52,857
But enough about Penny.

261
00:10:52,858 --> 00:10:54,658
Let's talk about us.

262
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:56,993
We're looking good.

263
00:10:56,995 --> 00:10:59,079
We are...

264
00:10:59,081 --> 00:11:00,747
Better than good.

265
00:11:00,749 --> 00:11:04,167
I mean, look at you.
Your body's bangin'!

266
00:11:04,169 --> 00:11:05,952
Amy!

267
00:11:05,954 --> 00:11:07,287
Don't “Amy” me.

268
00:11:07,289 --> 00:11:08,288
We're always talking
about how hot Penny is.

269
00:11:08,290 --> 00:11:10,624
Come on— scientist
to scientist,

270
00:11:10,626 --> 00:11:14,294
how big are those
Hadron Colliders?

271
00:11:16,131 --> 00:11:18,548
You're embarrassing me.

272
00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:19,633
Oh, don't be embarrassed.

273
00:11:19,635 --> 00:11:21,968
I'll show you the divot
in my spine.

274
00:11:21,970 --> 00:11:22,579
What?

275
00:11:22,603 --> 00:11:24,522
No, no, it's okay.
I was born with it.

276
00:11:24,523 --> 00:11:26,723
If you put a double-A
battery in there,

277
00:11:26,725 --> 00:11:29,609
it makes my leg kick.

278
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:32,812
All right.

279
00:11:32,814 --> 00:11:35,065
Oh, this is already better.
There are

280
00:11:35,067 --> 00:11:37,450
far fewer distractions in here.

281
00:11:37,452 --> 00:11:38,568
Plus, this is where our minds

282
00:11:38,570 --> 00:11:39,869
are conditioned
to focus on work.

283
00:11:39,871 --> 00:11:41,571
So, I've been thinking
about the hover boards,

284
00:11:41,573 --> 00:11:44,290
and maybe there's a way
we could use Maglev technology.

285
00:11:44,292 --> 00:11:46,993
Or if we could figure out a
way to supercool the materials,

286
00:11:46,995 --> 00:11:48,628
we could utilize
quantum coupling.

287
00:11:48,630 --> 00:11:50,797
Well, I wonder
if anyone's tried that.

288
00:11:50,799 --> 00:11:52,298
Go online and look it up.

289
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:53,883
Oh, I can't argue with him.

290
00:11:53,885 --> 00:11:55,335
It's right there on the screen.

291
00:11:55,337 --> 00:11:58,888
Austria does look like a wiener.

292
00:11:59,925 --> 00:12:01,057
That's nothing, dude.

293
00:12:01,059 --> 00:12:03,209
Go check out
how hung Florida is.

294
00:12:05,313 --> 00:12:07,430
I'm sure Mrs. Florida's
walking funny.

295
00:12:07,432 --> 00:12:08,848
Can we get back to work?

296
00:12:10,102 --> 00:12:11,601
Yeah... he's right.

297
00:12:11,603 --> 00:12:13,820
Oh, here's a thought.

298
00:12:13,822 --> 00:12:17,273
What if we use some form of
operant conditioning techniques

299
00:12:17,275 --> 00:12:19,242
to keep us from
getting off topic?

300
00:12:19,244 --> 00:12:21,111
Like behavior modification?

301
00:12:21,113 --> 00:12:22,162
Yeah, exactly.

302
00:12:22,164 --> 00:12:23,430
Did you know

303
00:12:23,432 --> 00:12:25,865
those techniques were used
to actually teach pigeons

304
00:12:25,867 --> 00:12:27,417
to play ping-pong?

305
00:12:27,419 --> 00:12:29,452
That cannot be true.

306
00:12:39,297 --> 00:12:42,298
Hey, it was match point.

307
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:44,851
Some psychologists

308
00:12:44,853 --> 00:12:46,803
perform operant conditioning
with punishment.

309
00:12:46,805 --> 00:12:48,271
Maybe we can come up
with a punishment

310
00:12:48,273 --> 00:12:50,140
for straying off topic.

311
00:12:50,142 --> 00:12:54,894
Not getting to see who wins at
pigeon ping-pong comes to mind.

312
00:12:54,896 --> 00:12:57,063
We could snap a rubber
band on our wrists

313
00:12:57,065 --> 00:12:59,032
every time we
get sidetracked.

314
00:12:59,034 --> 00:13:02,485
Mmm, not bad.
You know, in medieval times,

315
00:13:02,487 --> 00:13:04,654
idle chatter was punished
with a device called

316
00:13:04,656 --> 00:13:06,322
the scold's bridle.

317
00:13:06,324 --> 00:13:07,907
It's an iron cage

318
00:13:07,909 --> 00:13:11,995
that's locked around the head
and pierces the tongue.

319
00:13:11,997 --> 00:13:15,198
If only we had one.

320
00:13:16,268 --> 00:13:18,468
Oh! I'll check Amazon.

321
00:13:23,792 --> 00:13:26,142
Housekeeping!

322
00:13:27,979 --> 00:13:29,596
We had a complaint

323
00:13:29,598 --> 00:13:33,116
about somebody pooping
on a party in there!

324
00:13:35,537 --> 00:13:38,188
It was us the whole time!

325
00:13:39,324 --> 00:13:41,191
Why'd you tell her?
It was working.

326
00:13:41,193 --> 00:13:42,659
Was it working?

327
00:13:42,661 --> 00:13:45,078
Yeah.

328
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:47,831
Oh, I'm so sorry.

329
00:13:47,833 --> 00:13:50,700
You guys look
like you're having fun.

330
00:13:50,702 --> 00:13:52,202
We're having
the best time.

331
00:13:52,204 --> 00:13:56,706
Guess who won $100
playing craps.

332
00:13:56,708 --> 00:13:58,208
That's a dollar.

333
00:13:58,210 --> 00:14:01,795
Then guess who wildly overtipped
a cocktail waitress.

334
00:14:01,797 --> 00:14:04,264
Hey, Penny... hey, let's go.

335
00:14:04,266 --> 00:14:07,600
We found a place that has
Australian male strippers.

336
00:14:07,602 --> 00:14:08,718
We want to see

337
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:11,054
if they twirl their junk
in the other direction.

338
00:14:21,483 --> 00:14:23,399
That sounds so great.

339
00:14:23,401 --> 00:14:25,902
But I have
a little more studying to do.

340
00:14:25,904 --> 00:14:28,705
Can you
believe this nerd?

341
00:14:29,741 --> 00:14:32,575
Come on, do you want to
sit here being a loser,

342
00:14:32,577 --> 00:14:33,743
or do you want to watch me climb

343
00:14:33,745 --> 00:14:35,245
into an Australian man's
G-string

344
00:14:35,247 --> 00:14:37,413
like a baby kangaroo?

345
00:14:42,754 --> 00:14:45,889
All right, guys, look,
I would love to go out,

346
00:14:45,891 --> 00:14:47,423
but I've got
to get this done, okay?

347
00:14:47,425 --> 00:14:49,592
So have fun at the club.
And if you get

348
00:14:49,594 --> 00:14:51,094
in trouble, find a policeman.

349
00:14:51,096 --> 00:14:52,929
And if he's taking off
his pants,

350
00:14:52,931 --> 00:14:55,315
he is not a real policeman.

351
00:14:55,317 --> 00:14:58,852
Okay, okay, this is obviously
very important to her.

352
00:14:58,854 --> 00:15:02,021
Let's just, we'll help her study
so she can get done quicker.

353
00:15:02,023 --> 00:15:03,740
Here...
here, I'm gonna quiz you.

354
00:15:03,742 --> 00:15:06,409
I'm gonna quiz you.

355
00:15:06,411 --> 00:15:08,778
I got your notes!

356
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:09,996
I got your notes!

357
00:15:09,998 --> 00:15:11,915
I got your notes!
If you want these,

358
00:15:11,917 --> 00:15:15,018
they're gonna be
at the strip club!

359
00:15:16,504 --> 00:15:18,454
Aren't you gonna chase her?

360
00:15:18,456 --> 00:15:20,757
To the walk-in closet? Sure.

361
00:15:28,466 --> 00:15:29,799
Okay, so we agree,

362
00:15:29,801 --> 00:15:31,134
whenever someone
takes us off topic

363
00:15:31,136 --> 00:15:34,437
they get their arm
hair yanked off.

364
00:15:34,439 --> 00:15:35,555
And I really
can't let that happen

365
00:15:35,557 --> 00:15:36,940
or the girl who does
my eyebrows will think

366
00:15:36,942 --> 00:15:38,441
I've been cheating on her.

367
00:15:39,477 --> 00:15:42,979
All right, now, one benefit
of quantum coupling...

368
00:15:42,981 --> 00:15:44,364
Wait, no, question:

369
00:15:44,366 --> 00:15:46,399
who decides if someone's
gone off topic?

370
00:15:46,401 --> 00:15:48,985
I think it'll be pretty clear.
If not, we'll take a vote.

371
00:15:48,987 --> 00:15:50,703
Oh, and also...

372
00:15:50,705 --> 00:15:53,323
Ow!

373
00:15:53,325 --> 00:15:55,408
W-We didn't vote!

374
00:15:55,410 --> 00:15:57,577
We didn't have to—
that was clearly a tangent.

375
00:15:57,579 --> 00:15:59,245
Now come on.
Back to work.

376
00:15:59,247 --> 00:16:01,130
If we're leaning towards
quantum coupling...

377
00:16:01,132 --> 00:16:03,249
Aah! Why?

378
00:16:03,251 --> 00:16:04,968
You said
“quantum coupling.”

379
00:16:04,970 --> 00:16:07,170
That made me think
of the show Quantum Leap.

380
00:16:07,172 --> 00:16:08,862
That's a tangent
and it's your fault.

381
00:16:08,862 --> 00:16:10,251
That's ridiculous.

382
00:16:10,275 --> 00:16:12,275
Sheldon, I vote that
is not a tangent.

383
00:16:12,727 --> 00:16:14,344
Thank you.
And now I owe you one.

384
00:16:14,346 --> 00:16:16,429
Ow!

385
00:16:16,431 --> 00:16:18,181
That was your fault.

386
00:16:18,183 --> 00:16:19,732
Hey!

387
00:16:19,734 --> 00:16:21,985
Ooh, that is a lot of hair.

388
00:16:22,654 --> 00:16:24,237
Ow!

389
00:16:24,239 --> 00:16:27,657
And now I'm gonna hear it
from Jenny.

390
00:16:27,659 --> 00:16:29,659
Everyone stop.

391
00:16:29,661 --> 00:16:30,910
This was a stupid idea.

392
00:16:30,912 --> 00:16:33,196
Negative reinforcement
isn't working.

393
00:16:33,198 --> 00:16:35,031
I think you mean
positive punishment.

394
00:16:35,033 --> 00:16:38,484
Negative reinforcement is the
removal of a positive stimulus.

395
00:16:38,486 --> 00:16:39,869
It's a common mistake.

396
00:16:39,871 --> 00:16:42,121
Negative reinforcement
is really wrong?

397
00:16:42,123 --> 00:16:43,873
Oh, it's used incorrectly
all the time.

398
00:16:43,875 --> 00:16:45,675
Even Bill Murray
makes that mistake

399
00:16:45,677 --> 00:16:47,694
in the first scene
of Ghostbusters.

400
00:16:47,696 --> 00:16:51,331
No way. Not Bill Murray.

401
00:16:51,333 --> 00:16:53,883
I'm studying the effect
of negative reinforcement

402
00:16:53,885 --> 00:16:55,802
on ESP ability.

403
00:16:55,804 --> 00:16:56,886
Huh.

404
00:16:56,888 --> 00:17:00,056
Bill Murray did get it wrong.

405
00:17:00,058 --> 00:17:01,858
Jump ahead to the Stay Puft
Marshmallow Man.

406
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:03,559
No!

407
00:17:03,561 --> 00:17:05,528
Leonard's right.

408
00:17:05,530 --> 00:17:07,063
We can't just jump ahead.

409
00:17:07,065 --> 00:17:09,732
We have to watch the whole movie.
Look.

410
00:17:09,734 --> 00:17:11,868
We keep procrastinating.

411
00:17:11,870 --> 00:17:13,703
We saw Back to the Future II,

412
00:17:13,705 --> 00:17:14,854
pigeons playing
ping-pong,

413
00:17:14,856 --> 00:17:16,406
a bunch of countries
that look like genitals

414
00:17:16,408 --> 00:17:19,409
and one guy whose genitals
look like Denmark!

415
00:17:20,578 --> 00:17:23,479
Yeah, sorry for
clicking on that.

416
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:27,050
It's late.
We've wasted hours.

417
00:17:27,052 --> 00:17:28,835
Can we please find it
in ourselves

418
00:17:28,837 --> 00:17:30,636
to do any amount of work
tonight?

419
00:17:30,638 --> 00:17:34,223
But we didn't see them bust
one ghost.

420
00:17:35,727 --> 00:17:38,394
So y-you're saying
we should stand here

421
00:17:38,396 --> 00:17:40,229
in my lab on a
Saturday night

422
00:17:40,231 --> 00:17:41,431
and watch the rest
of Ghostbusters

423
00:17:41,433 --> 00:17:43,099
on a crappy laptop?

424
00:17:43,101 --> 00:17:44,567
No.

425
00:17:54,713 --> 00:17:57,080
It really does hold up.

426
00:18:05,874 --> 00:18:09,292
See? Isn't this better
than a hotel room?

427
00:18:09,294 --> 00:18:12,295
Yep. Shake that thing!

428
00:18:12,297 --> 00:18:16,582
Have you ever seen a body
so fine?

429
00:18:16,584 --> 00:18:19,268
We had some pretty hot corpses
in my anatomy class,

430
00:18:19,270 --> 00:18:21,771
but none of them
moved like that!

431
00:18:36,617 --> 00:18:39,154
Good morning.

432
00:18:39,155 --> 00:18:40,788
You want to go
to the pool?

433
00:18:43,159 --> 00:18:46,160
Come on...
you said it yourself.

434
00:18:46,162 --> 00:18:49,029
Only nerds and losers
stay in the room.

435
00:18:49,031 --> 00:18:52,282
Oh! Oh!
Oh!

436
00:18:52,284 --> 00:18:54,001
Wow, it's bright out.

437
00:18:54,003 --> 00:18:56,670
Isn't it bright? I should
probably close these curtains.

438
00:18:56,672 --> 00:18:58,288
Nah. Bye!

439
00:18:59,375 --> 00:19:02,242
Would you please close
the drapes?

440
00:19:02,244 --> 00:19:03,544
Okay.

441
00:19:06,703 --> 00:19:13,203
