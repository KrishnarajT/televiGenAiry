1
00:00:02,368 --> 00:00:04,301
So, tell me about your day—
how's it going

2
00:00:04,303 --> 00:00:05,535
with the particle detector?

3
00:00:05,537 --> 00:00:07,838
Wow! You remember that?

4
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:09,506
Yeah, I listen
to what you say.

5
00:00:09,508 --> 00:00:11,041
You're building
a particle detector

6
00:00:11,043 --> 00:00:12,876
using superfluid helium.

7
00:00:12,878 --> 00:00:14,878
You know, when you
talk like that,

8
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:17,381
I want to take you
right here on this table.

9
00:00:17,383 --> 00:00:19,383
And you know
from past experience

10
00:00:19,385 --> 00:00:21,285
this table cannot support
both our weight.

11
00:00:23,021 --> 00:00:24,721
So, how's
the detector going?

12
00:00:24,723 --> 00:00:27,057
Well, it's tricky working
with superfluids.

13
00:00:27,059 --> 00:00:28,292
Whatever container
you put them in,

14
00:00:28,294 --> 00:00:29,693
they kind of
creep up the sides

15
00:00:29,695 --> 00:00:31,194
and crawl out
all on their own.

16
00:00:31,196 --> 00:00:33,597
Kind of like
Sheldon's ant farm.

17
00:00:33,599 --> 00:00:36,266
Exactly, except you don't have
a lunatic running around,

18
00:00:36,268 --> 00:00:39,670
yelling, "I fed you sugar water,
why are you biting me?"

19
00:00:41,306 --> 00:00:43,373
Come on, this is boring— you
really want to talk about this?

20
00:00:43,375 --> 00:00:44,308
No, I do.

21
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:45,676
I-I didn't write
"superfluid helium"

22
00:00:45,678 --> 00:00:47,477
on this napkin for nothing.

23
00:00:48,313 --> 00:00:49,613
Okay, well...

24
00:00:49,615 --> 00:00:50,981
This is cool.

25
00:00:50,983 --> 00:00:53,317
Uh, there's a thing called
"superfluid vacuum theory",

26
00:00:53,319 --> 00:00:55,319
where empty space is
imagined as a superfluid

27
00:00:55,321 --> 00:00:56,887
with all of
its qualities—

28
00:00:56,889 --> 00:00:59,156
viscosity, density,
surface tension...

29
00:01:01,225 --> 00:01:03,593
Hey, if you're pausing
for dramatic effect,

30
00:01:03,595 --> 00:01:05,929
I'd keep it moving.

31
00:01:05,931 --> 00:01:07,431
No, no.

32
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:12,869
People don't talk
about surface tension.

33
00:01:12,871 --> 00:01:16,239
If you imagine our
three-space as the surface

34
00:01:16,241 --> 00:01:18,942
of an N-dimensional
superfluid bubble...

35
00:01:18,944 --> 00:01:22,045
This... is exciting.

36
00:01:22,047 --> 00:01:23,280
This is really exciting.

37
00:01:23,282 --> 00:01:24,414
I have to go
find Sheldon.

38
00:01:24,416 --> 00:01:27,484
Okay, well,
if you find him,

39
00:01:27,486 --> 00:01:28,719
use the kitchen island—

40
00:01:28,721 --> 00:01:30,654
that coffee table will not
support both of you.

41
00:01:33,624 --> 00:01:36,426
Which means a spherical
multidimensional superfluid

42
00:01:36,428 --> 00:01:38,795
shows the same negative-energy
density as space-time.

43
00:01:38,797 --> 00:01:41,598
So what do you think? What do
you think? So what do you think?

44
00:01:44,769 --> 00:01:46,770
Hmm...

45
00:01:46,772 --> 00:01:48,372
What? Is it wrong?

46
00:01:48,374 --> 00:01:49,873
Have you seen it somewhere else?

47
00:01:52,176 --> 00:01:54,378
Hmm...

48
00:01:55,213 --> 00:01:56,480
I know this isn't my area,

49
00:01:56,482 --> 00:01:58,648
and I could never
do the math like you can,

50
00:01:58,650 --> 00:02:00,384
but could this be something...?

51
00:02:00,386 --> 00:02:01,386
Well...

52
00:02:03,689 --> 00:02:07,290
You could have set Newton's
gravitational constant to one.

53
00:02:07,292 --> 00:02:09,659
And, ugh, the whole thing reeks
of blueberry.

54
00:02:09,661 --> 00:02:12,562
You know I can't stand
these scented markers.

55
00:02:13,364 --> 00:02:15,866
No one told you to taste them.

56
00:02:16,734 --> 00:02:18,835
Come on, is-is this
good or not?

57
00:02:20,472 --> 00:02:21,938
It's good.

58
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:23,707
Really?
I like it.

59
00:02:23,709 --> 00:02:25,108
I think you're on to something.

60
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:26,410
You do? You're not
messing with me?

61
00:02:26,412 --> 00:02:27,511
Not at all.

62
00:02:27,513 --> 00:02:29,913
In fact,
I have got something

63
00:02:29,915 --> 00:02:31,281
for just such
an occasion.

64
00:02:31,283 --> 00:02:32,382
I was starting to think

65
00:02:32,384 --> 00:02:34,484
I might never get a chance
to give it to you.

66
00:02:34,486 --> 00:02:36,186
Good job.

67
00:02:41,025 --> 00:02:43,427
You're giving me a sticker?

68
00:02:43,429 --> 00:02:45,328
Not just a sticker.

69
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:48,932
That is a sticker of a kitty
saying, "Me-wow!"

70
00:02:50,835 --> 00:02:53,103
I'm not a preschooler.

71
00:02:53,105 --> 00:02:54,838
Fine, I'll take it back.

72
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:57,140
I earned this!

83
00:03:28,175 --> 00:03:30,309
You're still awake?

84
00:03:30,311 --> 00:03:32,945
For a man whose
last observation was

85
00:03:32,947 --> 00:03:34,513
our universe may be the surface

86
00:03:34,515 --> 00:03:36,815
of a multidimensional
supercooled liquid,

87
00:03:36,817 --> 00:03:40,152
"you're still awake" seems
like quite the sophomore slump.

88
00:03:41,521 --> 00:03:43,455
You worked out
all the math.

89
00:03:43,457 --> 00:03:46,225
Oh, I did more
than work out all the math.

90
00:03:46,227 --> 00:03:48,661
I wrote a paper.

91
00:03:49,829 --> 00:03:51,730
You wrote a paper
on my idea?

92
00:03:51,732 --> 00:03:54,767
I wrote a paper
on our idea.

93
00:03:54,769 --> 00:03:57,836
When did my idea
become our idea?

94
00:03:57,838 --> 00:03:59,838
When I mixed it with
Sheldony goodness

95
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:03,208
and cooked it in the
Easy-Bake Oven of my mind.

96
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:07,246
This is good.

97
00:04:07,248 --> 00:04:08,847
Our idea is really good.

98
00:04:08,849 --> 00:04:12,084
Well, the lightbulb in this
oven is ridiculously bright.

99
00:04:14,554 --> 00:04:16,522
You know, if no one's
thought of this, yet,

100
00:04:16,524 --> 00:04:17,823
this could be a big deal.

101
00:04:17,825 --> 00:04:19,291
Only way we'll
know for sure is

102
00:04:19,293 --> 00:04:21,660
if we post it online to
the pre-print server.

103
00:04:21,662 --> 00:04:25,230
I have it ready to go, but I
wasn't gonna do it without you.

104
00:04:27,067 --> 00:04:29,468
Wow, it's all
happening so fast.

105
00:04:30,303 --> 00:04:32,004
Should we just sleep on it?

106
00:04:32,006 --> 00:04:34,673
We could, but we
always run the risk

107
00:04:34,675 --> 00:04:36,675
of someone else beating
us to the punch.

108
00:04:37,811 --> 00:04:39,078
You're sure it's good?

109
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:41,780
My name is right on
there with yours.

110
00:04:41,782 --> 00:04:45,317
That is a surefire
mark of quality.

111
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:48,954
That might as well say
"Directed by Joss Whedon".

112
00:04:52,025 --> 00:04:53,726
Okay, partner, let's do it.

113
00:04:56,596 --> 00:04:58,163
Come on.

114
00:04:58,165 --> 00:05:00,099
Click the
mouse with me.

115
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:05,871
One...

116
00:05:05,873 --> 00:05:07,373
two...

117
00:05:07,375 --> 00:05:08,607
three...

118
00:05:08,609 --> 00:05:10,209
Click.

119
00:05:13,546 --> 00:05:14,680
Well, we did it.

120
00:05:14,682 --> 00:05:16,715
Yes, we did,
my friend.

121
00:05:16,717 --> 00:05:17,850
Is your tongue blue?

122
00:05:17,852 --> 00:05:20,753
I don't want to
talk about it.

123
00:05:21,855 --> 00:05:23,655
Okay, movie night—
what do you want to watch?

124
00:05:23,657 --> 00:05:25,657
Whatever happened
to that ape movie you were in?

125
00:05:25,659 --> 00:05:26,792
Oh, God.

126
00:05:26,794 --> 00:05:27,926
Probably nothing.

127
00:05:27,928 --> 00:05:29,862
I think I saw the director
twirling a sign

128
00:05:29,864 --> 00:05:31,997
outside the Verizon store.

129
00:05:31,999 --> 00:05:33,365
Search for it.

130
00:05:33,367 --> 00:05:34,400
Wha... no.

131
00:05:34,402 --> 00:05:35,367
No! Why?

132
00:05:35,369 --> 00:05:36,668
'Cause it would be
fun to watch.

133
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:38,237
It would be humiliating.

134
00:05:38,239 --> 00:05:40,806
Well, now we have
two reasons.

135
00:05:42,575 --> 00:05:43,575
They have it.

136
00:05:43,577 --> 00:05:44,543
Please,
can we watch it?

137
00:05:44,545 --> 00:05:45,677
Please?

138
00:05:45,679 --> 00:05:48,080
Fine, but I'm telling you—
it's terrible.

139
00:05:48,082 --> 00:05:50,482
Have you even seen it?
No.

140
00:05:50,484 --> 00:05:52,017
Well, maybe it turned out
better than you think.

141
00:05:53,187 --> 00:05:55,087
Bananas,
get your fresh bananas.

142
00:05:55,889 --> 00:05:57,923
It really didn't.

143
00:06:02,695 --> 00:06:06,331
Sheldon, this is
superfluid helium.

144
00:06:06,333 --> 00:06:07,699
Put this in
your mouth,

145
00:06:07,701 --> 00:06:09,601
your tongue will
freeze and break off.

146
00:06:11,337 --> 00:06:14,173
Does it smell like blueberries?

147
00:06:14,175 --> 00:06:15,175
No.

148
00:06:15,176 --> 00:06:17,242
Then we're probably okay.

149
00:06:17,244 --> 00:06:19,178
Hey, your paper
got mentioned

150
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:20,679
on the Quantum Diaries
physics blog.

151
00:06:20,681 --> 00:06:21,914
Really?

152
00:06:21,916 --> 00:06:23,582
Wh-What'd they say?

153
00:06:23,584 --> 00:06:25,250
Uh, it's basically
a summary of the theory,

154
00:06:25,252 --> 00:06:26,952
but there's a bunch of positive
comments on the message board.

155
00:06:26,954 --> 00:06:29,288
Let me see,
let me see.

156
00:06:29,290 --> 00:06:32,658
One calls it "insightful
and innovative".

157
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:34,493
We're insightful
and innovative.

158
00:06:34,495 --> 00:06:37,029
Ooh, nice to meet you,
Mr. Insightful.

159
00:06:37,031 --> 00:06:39,131
Oh, the pleasure is mine,
Mr. Innovative.

160
00:06:40,767 --> 00:06:42,768
Uh, another one says,
"The concept shows

161
00:06:42,770 --> 00:06:44,770
some real out-of-the-box
thinking".

162
00:06:44,772 --> 00:06:47,339
Do you hear that,
Mr. Out-Of-The?

163
00:06:47,341 --> 00:06:50,542
I do, indeed,
Mr. Box-Thinking.

164
00:06:50,544 --> 00:06:51,844
How are you today,

165
00:06:51,846 --> 00:06:54,713
Mr. Can-You-Believe-
These-Jack-Asses?

166
00:06:54,715 --> 00:06:57,015
Just dandy, Mr...

167
00:06:57,017 --> 00:07:00,652
I-Wish-I-Was-
Better-At-Improv.

168
00:07:00,654 --> 00:07:02,821
Read another one.
Okay, okay. Uh...

169
00:07:02,823 --> 00:07:05,357
"The analogy
between space-time

170
00:07:05,359 --> 00:07:08,627
and a supercooled fluid is
either meaningless or... false".

171
00:07:08,629 --> 00:07:12,464
"I wish this blog would
devote itself to real science

172
00:07:12,466 --> 00:07:14,733
"instead of wasting
our time with crackpot,

173
00:07:14,735 --> 00:07:17,870
wannabe theoreticians
in a rush to publish".

174
00:07:17,872 --> 00:07:19,004
Who wrote that?

175
00:07:19,006 --> 00:07:20,305
It's anonymous,

176
00:07:20,307 --> 00:07:23,142
and user name
"General Relativity."

177
00:07:23,144 --> 00:07:25,677
Well... I'm responding to it.

178
00:07:25,679 --> 00:07:27,379
Uh, don't lower yourself
to their level.

179
00:07:27,381 --> 00:07:28,814
Look, I am simply

180
00:07:28,816 --> 00:07:31,350
going to defend our work,
scientist to scientist.

181
00:07:31,352 --> 00:07:32,885
And failing that,

182
00:07:32,887 --> 00:07:34,686
suggest that his mother enjoys
a string

183
00:07:34,688 --> 00:07:37,623
of both human
and non-human lovers.

184
00:07:37,625 --> 00:07:40,826
Sheldon, my name's
on that paper, too.

185
00:07:40,828 --> 00:07:42,394
There's no upside to doing this.

186
00:07:42,396 --> 00:07:43,795
He just left another comment.

187
00:07:43,797 --> 00:07:45,664
What does it say?

188
00:07:45,666 --> 00:07:48,867
"Upon review, I've
changed my mind about

189
00:07:48,869 --> 00:07:50,269
"the Cooper-Hofstadter
hypothesis

190
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:52,671
"that space-time is like
a superfluid. In fact,

191
00:07:52,673 --> 00:07:55,974
"it's inspired me to come up
with my own theory.

192
00:07:55,976 --> 00:07:57,843
"Maybe space-time is like
two clowns

193
00:07:57,845 --> 00:07:59,144
"with their heads in a bucket,

194
00:07:59,146 --> 00:08:03,115
much like Cooper
and Hofstadter."

195
00:08:03,117 --> 00:08:04,850
Can I respond now?

196
00:08:04,852 --> 00:08:06,485
Do it.

197
00:08:06,487 --> 00:08:09,855
You mess with the bull,
you get the horns.

198
00:08:09,857 --> 00:08:13,425
I'm about to show this guy
just how horny I can be.

199
00:08:17,897 --> 00:08:20,065
Somebody else do it.

200
00:08:22,068 --> 00:08:24,236
Doctor, please help me.

201
00:08:24,238 --> 00:08:28,073
I think I might be turning
into a killer gorilla.

202
00:08:28,075 --> 00:08:30,876
Why do you think you're turning
into a killer gorilla

203
00:08:30,878 --> 00:08:32,578
and not just a regular gorilla?

204
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:36,181
Because regular gorillas
are vegetarians,

205
00:08:36,183 --> 00:08:38,483
and I just bit the fingers
off your receptionist!

206
00:08:39,753 --> 00:08:42,988
Okay, we've seen plenty.
No!

207
00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:44,089
Give me the remote.

208
00:08:44,091 --> 00:08:46,658
Careful. She'll bite
your fingers off.

209
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:48,760
Okay, well, I've been
poking around the internet,

210
00:08:48,762 --> 00:08:51,797
and I think I found something
we'll enjoy watching even more.

211
00:08:51,799 --> 00:08:52,831
What is it?

212
00:08:52,833 --> 00:08:53,932
Oh, just a video

213
00:08:53,934 --> 00:08:55,901
of Bernadette
in a beauty pageant.

214
00:08:55,903 --> 00:08:57,002
What?

215
00:08:57,004 --> 00:08:58,604
Okay, I learned my lesson.

216
00:08:58,606 --> 00:09:00,839
Making fun of people is wrong!

217
00:09:01,608 --> 00:09:03,175
I haven't learned
my lesson.

218
00:09:03,177 --> 00:09:05,377
Play it! Play it!

219
00:09:10,784 --> 00:09:14,553
Hi. I'm Bernadette Maryann
Rostenkowski

220
00:09:14,555 --> 00:09:18,090
from Yorba Linda, California.

221
00:09:19,158 --> 00:09:23,362
You look like
a talking cupcake!

222
00:09:23,364 --> 00:09:24,763
And you should pick me

223
00:09:24,765 --> 00:09:27,799
for Miss California Quiznos
1999, because I want to...

224
00:09:27,801 --> 00:09:30,002
Tell you what I want,
what I really really want

225
00:09:30,004 --> 00:09:31,870
I'll tell you what I want,
what I really really want

226
00:09:31,872 --> 00:09:34,039
I wanna, I wanna,
I wanna, I wanna

227
00:09:34,041 --> 00:09:39,211
Really, really, really be
Miss California Quiznos 1999!

228
00:09:43,116 --> 00:09:45,217
Play it again!
Play it again!

229
00:09:55,284 --> 00:09:57,920
Did he respond yet?

230
00:09:57,921 --> 00:09:59,079
Hmm. No, not yet.

231
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:00,412
Well,

232
00:10:00,414 --> 00:10:02,081
maybe we shouldn't have sunk
to his level.

233
00:10:02,083 --> 00:10:03,782
It wasn't that bad.

234
00:10:03,784 --> 00:10:05,451
Read it back one more time.

235
00:10:06,787 --> 00:10:10,489
"My good sir, we are neither
crackpots nor wannabes.

236
00:10:10,491 --> 00:10:13,392
"In fact, we are
experts in our fields.

237
00:10:13,394 --> 00:10:15,694
"And while you hide
behind your anonymity,

238
00:10:15,696 --> 00:10:17,730
"we stand behind our paper.

239
00:10:17,732 --> 00:10:20,132
And later tonight, your mother".

240
00:10:23,503 --> 00:10:25,604
And you don't think
that's too rough?

241
00:10:25,606 --> 00:10:28,207
We're just standing behind her.

242
00:10:28,209 --> 00:10:31,276
It's not like we're gonna say
"boo" and scare her.

243
00:10:33,947 --> 00:10:36,715
How could you not tell us
you were in beauty pageants?

244
00:10:36,717 --> 00:10:38,517
'Cause it's
embarrassing.

245
00:10:38,519 --> 00:10:41,120
It is; it truly is.

246
00:10:42,455 --> 00:10:43,789
Yeah, well...

247
00:10:43,791 --> 00:10:46,492
Amy writes Little House
on the Prairie fan fiction

248
00:10:46,494 --> 00:10:49,028
about herself
and posts it on the Internet.

249
00:10:51,665 --> 00:10:53,565
No!

250
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:56,769
Why? What did I do?

251
00:10:56,771 --> 00:10:59,004
Sorry, I had to get
the spotlight off me,

252
00:10:59,006 --> 00:11:01,774
and tearing down other women
is part of my pageant training.

253
00:11:01,776 --> 00:11:04,476
Okay. We are
reading that right now.

254
00:11:04,478 --> 00:11:05,544
No, please don't.

255
00:11:05,546 --> 00:11:07,713
We got embarrassed
tonight. Come on.

256
00:11:07,715 --> 00:11:08,881
But it's personal.

257
00:11:08,883 --> 00:11:10,582
Why? Is it about you
and Sheldon?

258
00:11:10,584 --> 00:11:12,317
No.

259
00:11:13,219 --> 00:11:15,120
Oh, my God, it's
about her and Sheldon.

260
00:11:15,122 --> 00:11:16,822
It's not about me and Sheldon.

261
00:11:16,824 --> 00:11:20,826
It's about a young woman
in the 1800s named Amelia...

262
00:11:20,828 --> 00:11:23,195
and the time-traveling physicist
named Cooper

263
00:11:23,197 --> 00:11:25,297
she falls in love with.

264
00:11:25,299 --> 00:11:27,299
Please show us?
Please?

265
00:11:27,301 --> 00:11:29,468
No.
You know I'm gonna read it either way.

266
00:11:29,470 --> 00:11:31,370
Good luck finding it.

267
00:11:32,606 --> 00:11:34,473
Amelia and...

268
00:11:34,475 --> 00:11:36,141
the time-trav...

269
00:11:36,143 --> 00:11:38,711
Found it!

270
00:11:38,713 --> 00:11:40,813
"It was just past dawn
on the prairie,

271
00:11:40,815 --> 00:11:42,314
"and like every morning,

272
00:11:42,316 --> 00:11:44,216
"Amelia prepared
to do her chores.

273
00:11:44,218 --> 00:11:47,219
Except something about
this morning felt different."

274
00:11:47,221 --> 00:11:48,687
Why?

275
00:11:50,523 --> 00:11:53,559
Why did it
feel different?

276
00:11:54,861 --> 00:11:57,629
"Maybe it was the first whisper
of winter in the air,

277
00:11:57,631 --> 00:11:59,998
"or maybe it was
the unconscious handsome man

278
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
"with porcelain skin
and curious clothing

279
00:12:02,002 --> 00:12:04,803
"she was about to discover
lying in the field.

280
00:12:04,805 --> 00:12:06,405
"A man who would
open her mind

281
00:12:06,407 --> 00:12:07,940
"to new possibilities

282
00:12:07,942 --> 00:12:11,043
and her body to new feelings."

283
00:12:16,217 --> 00:12:20,552
You know, there was a time when
I was alone and had no friends.

284
00:12:20,554 --> 00:12:22,855
I'm starting to miss that.

285
00:12:25,291 --> 00:12:26,959
He still hasn't responded.

286
00:12:26,961 --> 00:12:28,594
What's taking him so long?

287
00:12:28,596 --> 00:12:30,729
Do you really want
him to write back?

288
00:12:30,731 --> 00:12:32,931
Yeah, I do.
No matter how he responds,

289
00:12:32,933 --> 00:12:37,202
I am going to destroy him
with a picture of a bored cat

290
00:12:37,204 --> 00:12:39,972
saying, "Oh, really?"

291
00:12:44,310 --> 00:12:46,178
Me-wow.

292
00:12:48,281 --> 00:12:49,381
What are you doing?

293
00:12:49,383 --> 00:12:52,284
I've, uh, created some
other user accounts

294
00:12:52,286 --> 00:12:55,187
so I can post positive
comments about their paper.

295
00:12:55,189 --> 00:12:58,056
"This wee li'l bairn
of a theory

296
00:12:58,058 --> 00:13:00,058
nearly blew my kilt off"?

297
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:03,228
No. You have to read it
how Dr. Angus McDoogal

298
00:13:03,230 --> 00:13:05,798
of the University
of Edinburgh would.

299
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:08,000
"This wee li'l bairn of a theory

300
00:13:08,002 --> 00:13:10,636
nearly blew me kilt off."

301
00:13:12,405 --> 00:13:14,439
He wrote back!

302
00:13:14,441 --> 00:13:18,410
"Cooper and Hofstadter resorting
to juvenile attempts at humor

303
00:13:18,412 --> 00:13:21,713
"is proof they have nothing to
back up their ridiculous paper.

304
00:13:21,715 --> 00:13:23,282
"It should come
as no surprise

00:13:23,284 --> 00:13:27,119
"given they work at Cal Tech,
essentially a technical school,

00:13:27,121 --> 00:13:30,689
where even the physicists
are basically engineers."

307
00:13:30,691 --> 00:13:32,958
"Engineers"!

308
00:13:34,494 --> 00:13:37,496
Do you know
how insulting that is?

309
00:13:37,498 --> 00:13:39,331
Yes.

310
00:13:39,333 --> 00:13:42,067
Guys, this person's
just going out of their way

311
00:13:42,069 --> 00:13:43,902
to get a rise out of you.

312
00:13:43,904 --> 00:13:46,171
Yeah, but it's still so aggravating.
Yeah, well,

313
00:13:46,173 --> 00:13:48,106
all the other comments
said really nice things.

314
00:13:48,108 --> 00:13:49,875
Focus on those.
Yeah.

315
00:13:49,877 --> 00:13:52,177
Dr. Dmitri Plancovik

316
00:13:52,179 --> 00:13:54,112

University said,

317
00:13:54,114 --> 00:13:56,081
"Dis paper great.

318
00:13:56,083 --> 00:13:58,984
I love it more
than 'wodka.".

319
00:14:00,386 --> 00:14:02,621
See? Better
with the accent.

320
00:14:02,623 --> 00:14:03,956
And...

321
00:14:03,958 --> 00:14:05,224
send.

322
00:14:05,226 --> 00:14:06,692
What did you write?

323
00:14:06,694 --> 00:14:08,093
I'm done hiding from bullies.

324
00:14:08,095 --> 00:14:09,995
I'm taking this
into the real world.

325
00:14:09,997 --> 00:14:12,231
What does that mean?
I told him we'll meet him

326
00:14:12,233 --> 00:14:14,099
face-to-face anytime, anywhere.

327
00:14:14,101 --> 00:14:16,134
Are you crazy?
You don't know who this person is.

328
00:14:16,136 --> 00:14:17,202
Delete that!
Come on, Sheldon!

329
00:14:17,204 --> 00:14:18,337
Oh, okay,

330
00:14:18,339 --> 00:14:20,539
okay, calm down.

331
00:14:22,209 --> 00:14:24,176
It's him!

332
00:14:24,178 --> 00:14:26,478
He's trying to video chat.

333
00:14:30,049 --> 00:14:33,685
Perhaps I shouldn't have
taken this into the real world.

334
00:14:33,687 --> 00:14:35,821
Oh, really?

335
00:14:38,458 --> 00:14:40,425
"'Time travel?
I don't understand,'

336
00:14:40,427 --> 00:14:42,427
"said Amelia.
Cooper stared at her.

337
00:14:42,429 --> 00:14:46,565
'Which rd don't you
understand, time or travel?'"

338
00:14:46,567 --> 00:14:50,435
Wow, even in your fantasies
Sheldon's kind of exhausting.

339
00:14:51,337 --> 00:14:53,472
He's like that
in the beginning,

340
00:14:53,474 --> 00:14:54,873
so she can change him.

341
00:14:54,875 --> 00:14:56,475
It's called good writing.

342
00:14:57,377 --> 00:14:59,478
And wishful thinking.

343
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:00,979
"It stung Amelia

344
00:15:00,981 --> 00:15:02,748

00:15:19,233 --> 00:15:21,366
"He asked her
if she had any questions.

356
00:15:21,368 --> 00:15:22,968
"All she longed to ask was

357
00:15:22,970 --> 00:15:25,304
"if his heart was beating
as fast as hers,

358
00:15:25,306 --> 00:15:26,471
"but she was too afraid

359
00:15:26,473 --> 00:15:27,839
to hear the answer."

360
00:15:27,841 --> 00:15:29,241
Oh, Amelia.

361
00:15:29,243 --> 00:15:31,276
"So instead she asked if,
in the future,

362
00:15:31,278 --> 00:15:34,880
Montana ever became a state."

363
00:15:37,684 --> 00:15:41,887
In the 1800s
that was considered flirting.

364
00:15:43,056 --> 00:15:46,325
I'm so sick of people
being mean on the Internet.

365
00:15:46,327 --> 00:15:48,860
Well, I think the anonymity
makes everyone feel like

366
00:15:48,862 --> 00:15:51,763
they can say things
they'd never say to your face.

367
00:15:51,765 --> 00:15:53,532
Interesting.

368
00:15:53,534 --> 00:15:55,567
I can't think of a single thing

369
00:15:55,569 --> 00:15:58,370
I wouldn't say
to someone's face.

370
00:15:58,372 --> 00:16:01,840
Never noticed that about you.

371
00:16:02,942 --> 00:16:06,311
You know what? A-At least
you guys did something.

372
00:16:06,313 --> 00:16:08,380
You know, you-you had a theory,

373
00:16:08,382 --> 00:16:09,748
you wrote a paper,

374
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:11,650
you made
an actual contribution.

375
00:16:11,652 --> 00:16:15,387
All guys like this do is just
stand on other people's work.

376
00:16:16,222 --> 00:16:18,757
He's right.

377
00:16:18,759 --> 00:16:22,027
I say we call this person back.

378
00:16:22,029 --> 00:16:24,563
We've got no reason to hide.

379
00:16:25,965 --> 00:16:28,200
All right, do it.
Call him.

380
00:16:28,202 --> 00:16:30,936
Let's find out what this loser's
ever accomplished.

381
00:16:34,474 --> 00:16:36,675
Click it with me.

382
00:16:37,744 --> 00:16:39,244
One, two, three...

383
00:16:39,246 --> 00:16:40,712
Click.
click.

384
00:16:43,384 --> 00:16:45,283
Well, hello there.

385
00:16:45,285 --> 00:16:47,853
Professor Hawking?

386
00:16:47,855 --> 00:16:51,723
Oh, brother, you should see
the look on your faces.

387
00:16:53,559 --> 00:16:55,961
You really
didn't like our paper?

388
00:16:55,963 --> 00:16:58,663
I like your paper very much.

389
00:16:58,665 --> 00:17:00,899
The premise is intriguing.

390
00:17:00,901 --> 00:17:04,336
Then why are you
attacking us?

391
00:17:04,338 --> 00:17:07,105
If you were sitting in a chair
for 40 years,

392
00:17:07,107 --> 00:17:09,141
you'd get bored, too.

393
00:17:10,710 --> 00:17:12,277
Anyway,

394
00:17:12,279 --> 00:17:13,645
got to go.

395
00:17:13,647 --> 00:17:17,649
I promised to help the neighbor
kid with his math homework.

396
00:17:18,851 --> 00:17:20,452
Ciao.

397
00:17:23,322 --> 00:17:26,124
Stephen Hawking
liked our paper.

398
00:17:27,227 --> 00:17:30,262
Said the premise
is intriguing.

399
00:17:30,264 --> 00:17:32,164
Good to see you again,

400
00:17:32,166 --> 00:17:35,333
Mr. Stephen-Hawking-
Liked-Our-Paper.

401
00:17:36,803 --> 00:17:40,739
And you as well,
Mr. Our-Premise-Is-Intriguing.

402
00:17:40,741 --> 00:17:44,676
How do you do, Mr. I'll-
Admit-That's-Pretty-Cool?

403
00:17:45,511 --> 00:17:49,114
Yeah, you keep
setting me up for failure.

404
00:17:51,684 --> 00:17:52,918
"With a heavy heart,

405
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:55,187
"Amelia stood before
the newly repaired time machine.

406
00:17:55,189 --> 00:17:57,722
She regretted giving Cooper
the part he needed."

407
00:17:57,724 --> 00:18:01,493
Because she wanted him
to give her the part she needed.

408
00:18:03,229 --> 00:18:04,663
Okay, that's enough.
What?

409
00:18:04,665 --> 00:18:07,365
No! I really want to know
what happens— and Bernadette

410
00:18:07,367 --> 00:18:10,368
really, really, really wants
to know what happens.

411
00:18:11,671 --> 00:18:13,638
You're just making fun of me.

412
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:15,373
I was just kidding.
I'm sorry.

413
00:18:15,375 --> 00:18:17,042
And the story's
really good!

414
00:18:17,044 --> 00:18:18,810
No, it is!
Does he stay?

415
00:18:18,812 --> 00:18:22,814
Do they kiss?
Does she find out about Montana?

416
00:18:23,749 --> 00:18:24,749
Please?

417
00:18:24,751 --> 00:18:26,351
Fine.

418
00:18:28,654 --> 00:18:30,789
"As Cooper prepared to depart,

419
00:18:30,791 --> 00:18:33,391
"tears filled Amelia's eyes.

420
00:18:33,393 --> 00:18:37,095
"He took her hand in his
and said, 'I can't stay,

421
00:18:37,097 --> 00:18:39,131
"but I will never forget you.'

422
00:18:39,133 --> 00:18:42,134
"He brushed his fingers
against her cheek,

423
00:18:42,136 --> 00:18:44,769
"then quickly stepped
into the machine.

424
00:18:44,771 --> 00:18:47,038
"'Please don't go,'
she whispered.

425
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:49,040
"But it was too late.

426
00:18:49,042 --> 00:18:51,109
"The engine hummed to life.

427
00:18:51,111 --> 00:18:53,211
But they didn't even kiss.

428
00:18:53,213 --> 00:18:54,880
"She turned away,

429
00:18:54,882 --> 00:18:56,581
"wiping her eyes.

430
00:18:56,583 --> 00:18:58,150
"She couldn't bear to watch

431
00:18:58,152 --> 00:19:01,353
"her one chance at true love
disappear forever.

432
00:19:01,355 --> 00:19:04,756
"Then... she felt a strong
hand on her shoulder

433
00:19:04,758 --> 00:19:06,057
"spin her around.

434
00:19:06,059 --> 00:19:07,459
"It was Cooper.

435
00:19:08,462 --> 00:19:11,029
Yes!

436
00:19:11,031 --> 00:19:13,365
"'What about the future?'
asked Amelia.

437
00:19:13,367 --> 00:19:17,469
"He looked deeply into her eyes
and whispered,

438
00:19:17,471 --> 00:19:19,905
"'There is no future
without you.'

439
00:19:19,907 --> 00:19:22,174
"He pulled her in close.

440
00:19:22,176 --> 00:19:25,010
"She began to
tremble all over.

441
00:19:25,012 --> 00:19:27,379
She felt his warm breath..."

442
00:19:27,381 --> 00:19:29,047
You will not believe
what Stephen Hawking just said.

443
00:19:29,049 --> 00:19:30,916
- Get out!
- Not now!

444
00:19:45,521 --> 00:19:48,423
Is the water warm enough?

445
00:19:48,426 --> 00:19:52,228
Given the fact that you took
the time to build a wood fire,

446
00:19:52,230 --> 00:19:54,630
draw the water from
the well and heat it,

447
00:19:54,632 --> 00:19:56,565
it would be rude
to complain.

448
00:19:58,568 --> 00:20:02,171
But since you asked,
it's a little nippy.

449
00:20:02,173 --> 00:20:04,173
I can fix that.

450
00:20:09,312 --> 00:20:13,649
I couldn't help but notice
your unusual undergarments.

451
00:20:13,651 --> 00:20:15,818
They're not undergarments.

452
00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:17,820
They're Underoos.

453
00:20:19,790 --> 00:20:21,657
Where I come from,
they're known as

454
00:20:21,659 --> 00:20:24,293
"underwear that's fun to wear."

455
00:20:25,495 --> 00:20:28,898
And what's the significance
of the spider?

456
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:31,600
Oh, that represents
Spider-Man.

457
00:20:31,602 --> 00:20:34,837
He does whatever
a spider can.

458
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:39,909
There's a lot of rhyming
in the future, isn't there?

459
00:20:39,911 --> 00:20:41,577
You're right.

460
00:20:41,579 --> 00:20:43,913
This is even weirder
than I thought.

461
00:20:43,915 --> 00:20:46,081
You want me to
stop reading?

462
00:20:46,083 --> 00:20:47,716
Are you kidding?
No, no.

463
00:20:48,785 --> 00:20:52,388
"As he stood for
Amelia to dry him..."

464
00:20:56,993 --> 00:20:59,361
So, tell me, Cooper...

465
00:20:59,363 --> 00:21:04,099
are the ways of physical love
different in the future?

466
00:21:04,101 --> 00:21:05,568
Yeah, okay, I'm good.
