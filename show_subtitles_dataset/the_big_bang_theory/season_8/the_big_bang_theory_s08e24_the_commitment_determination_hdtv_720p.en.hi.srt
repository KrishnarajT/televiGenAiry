1
00:00:06,862 --> 00:00:10,398
Can you believe it's been
five years since our first date?

2
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:12,833
I know.

3
00:00:12,834 --> 00:00:18,005
Do you think I should start
watching The Flash TV show?

4
00:00:20,909 --> 00:00:23,711
That's what
you're thinking about?

5
00:00:23,712 --> 00:00:25,613
Well, one of the things.

6
00:00:25,615 --> 00:00:29,083
Are any of them me?

7
00:00:29,084 --> 00:00:30,084
Yes.

8
00:00:30,086 --> 00:00:31,685
I thought, “I can't decide

9
00:00:31,688 --> 00:00:33,721
“if I should watch
The Flash TV show.

10
00:00:33,722 --> 00:00:35,789
I know, I'll ask Amy.”

11
00:00:36,926 --> 00:00:39,126
Anyway...

12
00:00:40,462 --> 00:00:42,195
What are you doing?

13
00:00:42,197 --> 00:00:45,231
You're right, you did
kind of kill the mood.

14
00:00:46,102 --> 00:00:47,401
I didn't kill anything.

15
00:00:47,402 --> 00:00:50,404
You did, talking about
your stupid TV show.

16
00:00:50,405 --> 00:00:52,039
Excuse me.

17
00:00:52,041 --> 00:00:55,142
Starting to watch a television
show that might run for years

18
00:00:55,143 --> 00:00:56,611
isn't a decision
to take lightly.

19
00:00:56,612 --> 00:00:58,212
I'm wrestling with

20
00:00:58,213 --> 00:01:00,081
a big commitment issue here.

21
00:01:00,082 --> 00:01:01,414
Really?

22
00:01:01,417 --> 00:01:05,185
That's the commitment issue
you're wrestling with?

23
00:01:05,187 --> 00:01:06,419
Sheldon,

24
00:01:06,422 --> 00:01:08,188
do you understand the irony

25
00:01:08,190 --> 00:01:10,625
of your fixation on a man
with super speed,

26
00:01:10,627 --> 00:01:13,360
while after five years
all I can get out of you

27
00:01:13,363 --> 00:01:16,096
is a distracted make-out session
on a couch?

28
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:19,967
Irony's not really
my strong suit.

29
00:01:20,937 --> 00:01:22,803
But I have been getting better
with sarcasm,

30
00:01:22,804 --> 00:01:25,106
if you want to give that a try.

31
00:01:25,107 --> 00:01:27,774
Oh, sure, I'd love to.

32
00:01:29,277 --> 00:01:31,512

Original Air Date on May 7,

42
00:01:56,535 --> 00:02:02,334
== sync, corrected by elderman ==
@elder_man

43
00:02:02,336 --> 00:02:03,931
I don't want to rush you,

44
00:02:03,932 --> 00:02:05,866
but I'm closing
a little early tonight.

45
00:02:05,869 --> 00:02:07,539
Ooh. Hot date?

46
00:02:07,541 --> 00:02:10,074
Uh, no. I overheard
Bernadette tell Howard

47
00:02:10,077 --> 00:02:11,543
she was making him a meat loaf,

48
00:02:11,544 --> 00:02:14,144
and you don't have
to not ask me twice.

49
00:02:15,549 --> 00:02:18,917
If I stick a lightbulb on this,
wouldn't it make a great lamp

50
00:02:18,918 --> 00:02:21,286
for my bedroom?

51
00:02:21,287 --> 00:02:24,054
You're kidding, right?

52
00:02:24,056 --> 00:02:26,024
Oh. Is this freaking you out?

53
00:02:26,025 --> 00:02:29,026
I guess I'm just more
of a Pottery Barn,

54
00:02:29,029 --> 00:02:31,061
Crate and Barrel kind of guy.

55
00:02:32,232 --> 00:02:34,899
Maybe Pier 1
if I really want to cut loose.

56
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:37,568
All right. Never mind.

57
00:02:37,571 --> 00:02:39,603
No, no, no.
Hey, you should totally get it.

58
00:02:39,606 --> 00:02:41,072
In fact, I'll buy it for you.

59
00:02:41,073 --> 00:02:42,506
Sold!

60
00:02:44,443 --> 00:02:46,376
Raj, you don't have to do that.

61
00:02:46,378 --> 00:02:48,346
Too late!
No returns!

62
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:53,484
That was really intense.

63
00:02:53,487 --> 00:02:56,287
Well, now we know, next time
we go to the farmers' market,

64
00:02:56,288 --> 00:03:00,491
the order is petting zoo first,
then buy vegetables.

65
00:03:03,196 --> 00:03:04,829
Hey.

66
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:07,499
Oh, good. You're here.
I need your assistance.

67
00:03:07,501 --> 00:03:10,268
Can it wait until I put
a Band-Aid on a goat bite?

68
00:03:11,738 --> 00:03:13,371
What happened?
Oh.

69
00:03:13,372 --> 00:03:16,007
Your buddy got mugged
by some baby farm animals.

70
00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:18,876
Been there.
Mmm.

71
00:03:18,878 --> 00:03:20,777
So what do you need help with?

72
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:23,914
Amy's mad at me,
and I'm not clear why.

73
00:03:23,917 --> 00:03:26,251
Okay. Were you talking
before she got upset?

74
00:03:26,252 --> 00:03:27,985
Yes.
That's probably it.

75
00:03:28,822 --> 00:03:30,954
What'd you say to her?

76
00:03:30,956 --> 00:03:32,850
Well, I just asked her
if I should start watching

77
00:03:32,851 --> 00:03:34,616
the new Flash TV series.

78
00:03:34,619 --> 00:03:36,119
And that made her angry?

79
00:03:36,121 --> 00:03:38,020
Baffling, right? We were necking

80
00:03:38,023 --> 00:03:40,924
like a couple of hooligans
under the school bleachers.

81
00:03:40,925 --> 00:03:43,493
I stopped so I could ask
the question.

82
00:03:43,495 --> 00:03:48,231
Next thing I know, good-bye,
kissy face. Hello, yelly face.

83
00:03:48,233 --> 00:03:50,365
Well, Sheldon, when
you're kissing a girl,

84
00:03:50,368 --> 00:03:52,835
she expects the
attention to be on her.

85
00:03:52,836 --> 00:03:54,336
It was. I asked her

86
00:03:54,339 --> 00:03:57,139
if she thought
I should watch The Flash.

87
00:03:57,142 --> 00:04:00,342
Yeah. I'm tapping out.
Leonard?

88
00:04:00,345 --> 00:04:02,679
I'm gonna guess that your main
concern is the time commitment

89
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:05,114
of watching an entire season
of a new show.

90
00:04:05,115 --> 00:04:06,382
Oh, no, not just a season.

91
00:04:06,383 --> 00:04:08,450
If I'm in,
I'm in for the whole run,

92
00:04:08,453 --> 00:04:11,253
even if the quality declines.

93
00:04:11,256 --> 00:04:14,056
I get it.
Smallville almost wrecked you.

94
00:04:14,059 --> 00:04:16,758
Yeah. Exactly.

95
00:04:16,761 --> 00:04:18,027
You know, I waited ten years

96
00:04:18,028 --> 00:04:20,530
to see a guy
everyone knows can fly, fly.

97
00:04:20,532 --> 00:04:22,931
Wait, what is wrong
with you two?

98
00:04:22,934 --> 00:04:25,434
He was talking about television
during their date night.

99
00:04:25,436 --> 00:04:28,503
Oh, not just date night—
our fifth anniversary.

100
00:04:28,506 --> 00:04:30,306
Okay, see, that's even dumber
than you wondering

101
00:04:30,307 --> 00:04:34,009
if being bitten by a goat would
give you the powers of a goat.

102
00:04:35,946 --> 00:04:38,313
If that happens,
don't make me wait ten years

103
00:04:38,316 --> 00:04:40,583
to watch you eat a tin can.

104
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:45,888
You guys ever notice that Emily
has a bit of a twisted side?

105
00:04:45,890 --> 00:04:47,857
You mean
'cause she has weird tattoos?

106
00:04:47,859 --> 00:04:50,960
No, because she wants to have
sex with me in a graveyard.

107
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:55,831
One more time?

108
00:04:55,833 --> 00:04:57,700
She and I were supposed to watch

109
00:04:57,701 --> 00:04:59,736
the new Avengers movie tonight,
but it was sold out.

110
00:04:59,737 --> 00:05:01,903
So I said,
“What else do you want to do?”

111
00:05:01,905 --> 00:05:03,539
She said,
“Let's go to a cemetery

112
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:06,008
and do it on somebody's grave.”

113
00:05:06,011 --> 00:05:10,580
Like, a random person
or somebody she knew?

114
00:05:10,581 --> 00:05:13,448
What difference
does it make?

115
00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:14,984
Well, if it's

116
00:05:14,986 --> 00:05:16,785
her father's grave
and they didn't get along,

117
00:05:16,787 --> 00:05:19,222
then you know
she holds a grudge.

118
00:05:20,491 --> 00:05:22,892
The only issue is that everybody
has their own thing.

119
00:05:22,893 --> 00:05:24,559
And as long
as it's two consenting adults,

120
00:05:24,561 --> 00:05:26,429
I guess
I don't see the harm in it.

121
00:05:26,431 --> 00:05:27,996
Well, what if it's
one consenting adult

122
00:05:27,999 --> 00:05:29,631
and one adult who
pretends to consent

123
00:05:29,633 --> 00:05:31,501
because he's afraid
of being alone?

124
00:05:33,003 --> 00:05:34,871
Well, then I guess
bring a blanket.

125
00:05:34,873 --> 00:05:36,873
The grass gets damp at night.

126
00:05:38,977 --> 00:05:40,376
I don't know, guys.

127
00:05:40,378 --> 00:05:42,345
Maybe this relationship
isn't for me.

128
00:05:42,347 --> 00:05:44,513
Maybe I should break up
with her.

129
00:05:44,515 --> 00:05:46,416
Right. You're gonna
break up with a girl

130
00:05:46,417 --> 00:05:49,018
who has sex with you.
Can you believe this guy?

131
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:53,155
I think if Raj wants to break up
with a girl, he can do it.

132
00:05:53,157 --> 00:05:54,924
How are you saying that
with a straight face?

133
00:05:54,926 --> 00:05:57,160
I don't know.

134
00:05:58,595 --> 00:06:00,196
You guys are being jerks.

135
00:06:00,198 --> 00:06:02,364
Buddy, other than Jenny Craig,

136
00:06:02,366 --> 00:06:05,100
you've never broken up
with a girl in your life.

137
00:06:05,102 --> 00:06:06,301
You're one
to talk.

138
00:06:06,304 --> 00:06:07,537
You've been complaining
about Stuart

139
00:06:07,539 --> 00:06:08,804
living here for the past year.

140
00:06:08,806 --> 00:06:10,439
I don't see you showing him
the door.

141
00:06:10,441 --> 00:06:11,741
That's not the
same thing.

142
00:06:11,743 --> 00:06:13,075
Emily's a person.

143
00:06:13,078 --> 00:06:14,811
Stuart's more like
an infestation,

144
00:06:14,813 --> 00:06:16,278
something you spray for.

145
00:06:17,114 --> 00:06:19,047
Baloney, okay?
You two are

146
00:06:19,049 --> 00:06:21,883
as afraid of hurting
someone's feelings as I am.

147
00:06:21,886 --> 00:06:24,419
That's not true. We were just
laughing right in your face.

148
00:06:27,392 --> 00:06:29,592
Thanks for cooking.
Mmm. My pleasure.

149
00:06:29,594 --> 00:06:32,695
That carrot was delicious.
Yeah.

150
00:06:32,696 --> 00:06:35,263
I wish I'd fought harder
for the rest of 'em.

151
00:06:39,037 --> 00:06:41,037
Still haven't heard
from her?

152
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:43,573
No, and I'm confused.

153
00:06:43,575 --> 00:06:45,640
It's been nearly 24 hours.

154
00:06:45,643 --> 00:06:49,479
Amy should have figured out
she's wrong by now.

155
00:06:50,681 --> 00:06:52,181
Hey, I don't think she's wrong

156
00:06:52,182 --> 00:06:54,417
about you going too slow
in the relationship.

157
00:06:54,419 --> 00:06:55,751
Too slow?

158
00:06:55,753 --> 00:06:56,886
Yeah, you've been
going out

159
00:06:56,888 --> 00:06:58,821
for years.
You haven't even slept together.

160
00:06:58,823 --> 00:07:02,124
That's right.
It's called foreplay.

161
00:07:03,727 --> 00:07:05,328
And I could make the case

162
00:07:05,330 --> 00:07:07,996
that you two aren't moving
forward in your relationship.

163
00:07:07,999 --> 00:07:09,097
Uh,

164
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:10,967
hello.

165
00:07:11,802 --> 00:07:13,503
Hello.

166
00:07:18,008 --> 00:07:20,376
No. Sheldon,
we're getting married.

167
00:07:20,378 --> 00:07:22,777
But you've been engaged
for over a year now,

168
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:24,313
and you don't even have
a wedding date.

169
00:07:24,314 --> 00:07:26,414
Well, we will. We're
just not in a rush.

170
00:07:26,417 --> 00:07:28,484
Okay.

171
00:07:30,121 --> 00:07:32,087
We're gonna set a date.

172
00:07:32,090 --> 00:07:34,724
Okay. If you say so.

173
00:07:34,725 --> 00:07:36,491
Yeah, it's just, things are good right now.
Really good.

174
00:07:36,494 --> 00:07:38,727
I'm focusing on my job.
And we've been busy with our paper.

175
00:07:38,729 --> 00:07:39,782
So busy.

176
00:07:39,806 --> 00:07:40,963
Yeah, we'll pick a date
when we pick a date.

177
00:07:40,965 --> 00:07:42,030
Yeah.

178
00:07:42,032 --> 00:07:45,133
Okay.

179
00:07:45,136 --> 00:07:47,270
You know, I can see
why Amy's mad at you.

180
00:07:47,272 --> 00:07:48,871
Yeah, shut up,
Sheldon!

181
00:07:51,475 --> 00:07:53,575
Did you eat
all my yogurt?

182
00:07:53,578 --> 00:07:55,710
You mean the one that
makes ladies do the thing

183
00:07:55,712 --> 00:07:57,179
that ladies pretend
they don't do

184
00:07:57,181 --> 00:07:59,982
even though they do?

185
00:08:01,785 --> 00:08:03,852
You know...

186
00:08:03,854 --> 00:08:06,422
which yogurt I mean.

187
00:08:06,424 --> 00:08:09,325
I didn't touch it.
Must have been Stuart.

188
00:08:09,326 --> 00:08:11,193
Maybe Raj is right.

189
00:08:11,196 --> 00:08:13,528
Maybe it's time we tell him
he needs to move out.

190
00:08:13,530 --> 00:08:15,463
We should have done
it months ago.

191
00:08:15,465 --> 00:08:17,066
I know, but his store
was reopening,

192
00:08:17,068 --> 00:08:19,568
and then there were the
holidays, and then he was sick.

193
00:08:19,571 --> 00:08:21,037
Yeah, right.

194
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:23,272
Sick. He didn't have jaundice.

195
00:08:23,273 --> 00:08:25,640
He just looks like that.

196
00:08:30,648 --> 00:08:33,316
All right.
Tonight's the night.

197
00:08:33,317 --> 00:08:34,483
Agreed.

198
00:08:34,484 --> 00:08:37,018
When he gets home, I'm
dropping the hammer.

199
00:08:37,021 --> 00:08:38,955
Ooh, I like
when you take charge.

200
00:08:38,956 --> 00:08:41,389
Oh, I'm not taking charge—
you're the hammer.

201
00:08:48,132 --> 00:08:50,032
So...

202
00:08:50,033 --> 00:08:52,401
why haven't we
picked a date?

203
00:08:52,402 --> 00:08:53,436
You know why.

204
00:08:53,437 --> 00:08:54,936
Well, of course I know why.

205
00:08:54,938 --> 00:08:56,772
But just for fun... why?

206
00:08:58,109 --> 00:09:00,710
Not in a rush, busy with work...

207
00:09:00,711 --> 00:09:03,278
Things are good right now.
Really good.

208
00:09:04,148 --> 00:09:05,880
You still want
to get married, right?

209
00:09:05,883 --> 00:09:08,149
Oh, my God. Yes.
Why would you even ask that?

210
00:09:08,152 --> 00:09:10,018
I don't know.
Because we don't have a date?

211
00:09:10,021 --> 00:09:12,321
Well, you want a date,
pick a date.

212
00:09:12,322 --> 00:09:13,522
It's not just the date.

213
00:09:13,523 --> 00:09:14,923
We haven't talked
about anything.

214
00:09:14,926 --> 00:09:16,825
Big wedding, small wedding,
indoor, outdoor...

215
00:09:16,827 --> 00:09:21,998
Outdoor? Oh.
I can RSVP no right now.

216
00:09:21,999 --> 00:09:24,233
Okay, indoor it is.
Big or small?

217
00:09:24,234 --> 00:09:26,034
Is your dad paying for it?
I doubt it.

218
00:09:26,037 --> 00:09:28,604
Okay, two friends each.

219
00:09:28,605 --> 00:09:31,474
All right, well,
I want it in a church.

220
00:09:31,475 --> 00:09:32,707
Fine. I want black-tie.

221
00:09:32,710 --> 00:09:34,777
Fine.
I want to release butterflies.

222
00:09:34,778 --> 00:09:37,279
Seriously? Airborne worms?

223
00:09:38,615 --> 00:09:40,548
Okay. Well, then it's settled:

224
00:09:40,551 --> 00:09:43,286
small indoor church wedding,
black-tie, no butterflies.

225
00:09:43,287 --> 00:09:44,720
Sounds perfect.
Great.

226
00:09:46,923 --> 00:09:48,257
You still
didn't pick a date.

227
00:09:48,258 --> 00:09:50,225
Stay out of it!
Shut up!

228
00:09:59,205 --> 00:10:01,069
Mmm. It's a beautiful night.

229
00:10:01,070 --> 00:10:03,773
Oh, yes, we've
got the moon

230
00:10:03,776 --> 00:10:05,508
and the trees and...

231
00:10:05,510 --> 00:10:07,510
Elizabeth McNulty,

232
00:10:07,513 --> 00:10:10,814
who apparently died
when she was the same age I am.

233
00:10:13,252 --> 00:10:15,119
Makes you feel
alive, doesn't it?

234
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,922
So does enjoying a meal
at a well-lit restaurant,

235
00:10:17,923 --> 00:10:20,523
but here we are.

236
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:23,326
You aren't scared, are you?

237
00:10:23,329 --> 00:10:25,963
Of ghosts, no.

238
00:10:25,965 --> 00:10:28,532
Of you, little bit.

239
00:10:31,037 --> 00:10:33,170
I'm sorry I've
upset you.

240
00:10:33,172 --> 00:10:35,272
I shouldn't have asked
so many questions.

241
00:10:35,273 --> 00:10:36,473
No, it's okay.

242
00:10:36,475 --> 00:10:38,008
Yeah, maybe it's good
you got us

243
00:10:38,009 --> 00:10:39,909
talking about this stuff.

244
00:10:39,912 --> 00:10:41,577
Well, look at that—

245
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:45,682
even when I'm causing problems,
I make the world a better place.

246
00:10:45,685 --> 00:10:48,918
Hey, next, why don't we tackle
your penchant for whining

247
00:10:48,921 --> 00:10:51,955
and Penny's love
of the ol' glug-glug?

248
00:10:55,293 --> 00:10:57,127
Uh, Sheldon, I think
we're good for now.

249
00:10:57,128 --> 00:10:58,461
Ah, well... very well.

250
00:10:58,464 --> 00:11:00,830
So does this mean you'll
finally pick a wedding date?

251
00:11:00,832 --> 00:11:02,800
Here we go again.

252
00:11:02,801 --> 00:11:05,601
Why is everyone so concerned
with us setting a date?

253
00:11:05,604 --> 00:11:07,003
We're committed to
each other. We're happy.

254
00:11:07,005 --> 00:11:09,505
A ceremony isn't gonna
change anything.

255
00:11:09,508 --> 00:11:12,142
So you're never getting married?

256
00:11:13,244 --> 00:11:14,711
It's his whining, isn't it?

257
00:11:14,714 --> 00:11:17,614
Sheldon, I'm not a whiner.

258
00:11:20,585 --> 00:11:22,986
It's amusing
that he doesn't hear it.

259
00:11:23,955 --> 00:11:27,157
Look, all she's saying
is we are in love

260
00:11:27,158 --> 00:11:28,558
so it doesn't matter
if we get married

261
00:11:28,561 --> 00:11:31,894
tomorrow or a year from now
or 50 years from now.

262
00:11:31,897 --> 00:11:34,531
Ew, 50?
We'll be old and gross.

263
00:11:34,532 --> 00:11:37,234
Yeah, but we'll be old
and gross together.

264
00:11:37,235 --> 00:11:38,668
My aunt and uncle

265
00:11:38,671 --> 00:11:40,970
were married 63 years.

266
00:11:40,973 --> 00:11:44,108
Towards the end, it was
like watching cheese melt.

267
00:11:54,787 --> 00:11:57,854
Um... I'm
free tonight.

268
00:12:03,396 --> 00:12:05,128
Are you saying
you want to get married?

269
00:12:05,130 --> 00:12:07,965
Vegas isn't
that far away.

270
00:12:08,834 --> 00:12:10,267
I'm in. Let's do it.

271
00:12:17,575 --> 00:12:19,843
After all these years.

272
00:12:20,779 --> 00:12:22,579
I'm really happy
for the two of you.

273
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:23,846
Oh, thank you.
Thanks.

274
00:12:23,849 --> 00:12:26,050
Now get out of my spot.

275
00:12:29,321 --> 00:12:32,221
Bernie, Stuart just pulled up.

276
00:12:32,925 --> 00:12:34,224
So remember,

277
00:12:34,225 --> 00:12:35,959
the key is to be firm.

278
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:37,094
Show no weakness.

279
00:12:37,095 --> 00:12:39,595
Right.
Good luck.

280
00:12:39,598 --> 00:12:42,166
Howard Joel Wolowitz,
you get back here.

281
00:12:43,335 --> 00:12:46,036
Never should have
told you my middle name.

282
00:12:46,037 --> 00:12:49,473
Hey, guys.
Hey, you got a minute?

283
00:12:49,475 --> 00:12:52,442
Sure. Uh, let me just put
this stuff in the fridge.

284
00:12:52,445 --> 00:12:54,744
I felt bad for finishing
your yogurt, so I bought more.

285
00:12:54,747 --> 00:12:56,979
And, Howard, your favorite
fruit is in season.

286
00:12:56,981 --> 00:12:58,749
Crunch Berries.

287
00:13:00,585 --> 00:13:02,385
Don't let that sway you.

288
00:13:02,388 --> 00:13:05,788
It's hard not to. They taste so
much better than real berries.

289
00:13:07,993 --> 00:13:09,292
What's up?

290
00:13:09,295 --> 00:13:11,894
So... we need to talk.

291
00:13:14,633 --> 00:13:16,966
You okay?

292
00:13:18,003 --> 00:13:19,470
I think we should talk.

293
00:13:20,705 --> 00:13:22,538
Is everything okay?

294
00:13:23,475 --> 00:13:26,276
Well... you've been
living here a while now.

295
00:13:26,277 --> 00:13:28,644
I know.
I may sell comic books at work,

296
00:13:28,647 --> 00:13:30,279
but the real superheroes

297
00:13:30,282 --> 00:13:32,081
are sitting
right in front of me.

298
00:13:35,186 --> 00:13:37,287
Yeah...

299
00:13:37,288 --> 00:13:40,590
His middle name is David. Go.

300
00:13:41,494 --> 00:13:44,293
Look, I care about you a lot,

301
00:13:44,296 --> 00:13:47,163
but we are very
different people.

302
00:13:47,166 --> 00:13:49,298
Are you breaking up with me?

303
00:13:50,536 --> 00:13:52,268
No, no, I'm just
pointing out that

304
00:13:52,271 --> 00:13:55,538
you're dark on the inside
and I'm dark on the outside.

305
00:13:56,908 --> 00:13:59,743
So, anyway,
what I'm trying to say is...

306
00:14:02,947 --> 00:14:04,080
You need to take that?

307
00:14:04,082 --> 00:14:05,382
It's just my dad,
probably calling

308
00:14:05,383 --> 00:14:07,683
to wish me a happy birthday.

309
00:14:08,686 --> 00:14:09,786
I'll call him back.

310
00:14:09,787 --> 00:14:11,787
You were saying?

311
00:14:13,225 --> 00:14:16,426
Look, Raj, be honest with me.

312
00:14:16,427 --> 00:14:18,327
If you want to end things,
just do it.

313
00:14:18,330 --> 00:14:20,196
Don't expect me
to do it for you.

314
00:14:21,901 --> 00:14:25,902
End things? I'm trying to
tell you that I love you.

315
00:14:28,106 --> 00:14:34,043
♪ Happy birthday to you. ♪

316
00:14:41,619 --> 00:14:43,586
Wow, there's
a Denny's in Vegas

317
00:14:43,589 --> 00:14:44,955
you can actually
get married in.

318
00:14:44,956 --> 00:14:47,456
Doesn't sound very romantic.

319
00:14:47,459 --> 00:14:49,859
Yeah, but we could get
heart-shaped pancakes.

320
00:14:49,861 --> 00:14:52,329
I'm sure we'll find
a decent chapel.

321
00:14:52,330 --> 00:14:54,163
Yeah.

322
00:14:54,166 --> 00:14:57,133
This is crazy!
I know!

323
00:14:57,136 --> 00:14:58,969
You think people
are gonna be mad?

324
00:14:58,970 --> 00:15:01,638
Maybe. But this isn't
about them; it's about us.

325
00:15:01,639 --> 00:15:04,740
It is.
It is about us.

326
00:15:04,743 --> 00:15:06,375
And you know what
the best part is?

327
00:15:06,378 --> 00:15:07,844
We took our time.

328
00:15:07,845 --> 00:15:10,614
I mean, we met, we were friends
for a couple years,

329
00:15:10,615 --> 00:15:14,017
then we got together,
and then we got untogether,

330
00:15:14,018 --> 00:15:15,752
then we worked out
all our problems,

331
00:15:15,753 --> 00:15:18,154
and now we know
everything about each other,

332
00:15:18,157 --> 00:15:22,091
we can just go forward with
no surprises and no regrets.

333
00:15:22,094 --> 00:15:24,360
Right.
No surprises.

334
00:15:25,663 --> 00:15:28,231
And no regrets.

335
00:15:33,104 --> 00:15:34,303
Uh,

336
00:15:34,306 --> 00:15:37,507
well, there-there's
one thing

337
00:15:37,508 --> 00:15:39,609
I feel I should tell you.

338
00:15:39,611 --> 00:15:40,643
What?

339
00:15:40,646 --> 00:15:43,247
You know, so we
can go into this

340
00:15:43,249 --> 00:15:45,548
with no secrets
between us.

341
00:15:45,551 --> 00:15:46,749
What?

342
00:15:50,623 --> 00:15:52,455
Remember, uh,
a couple years back

343
00:15:52,457 --> 00:15:55,392
when I was on that research ship
in the North Sea?

344
00:15:55,393 --> 00:15:56,994
Yeah.
Okay, well,

345
00:15:56,995 --> 00:15:59,296
there-there was a
lot of drinking

346
00:15:59,297 --> 00:16:01,431
and craziness going on...
No, you told me.

347
00:16:01,432 --> 00:16:03,133
Okay, um...

348
00:16:04,836 --> 00:16:07,436
Well, there was this girl.

349
00:16:08,673 --> 00:16:10,740
What did you do?
Nothing...

350
00:16:10,743 --> 00:16:12,242
really.

351
00:16:12,244 --> 00:16:13,844
It was just kissing.

352
00:16:13,845 --> 00:16:15,878
And then what?
And then nothing.

353
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:18,447
I stopped it.

354
00:16:18,450 --> 00:16:22,319
But it still bothers me, and...

355
00:16:24,188 --> 00:16:26,056
I wanted you to know.

356
00:16:29,394 --> 00:16:31,595
All right.

357
00:16:33,264 --> 00:16:35,632
Did you ever do anything
like this since we've been...?

358
00:16:35,633 --> 00:16:38,167
Nope, never.
Oh, that's too bad.

359
00:16:39,204 --> 00:16:42,438
You know, can I ask you a question?
Hmm?

360
00:16:42,441 --> 00:16:43,840
Why are you
telling me this now?

361
00:16:43,841 --> 00:16:47,176
Well, like I said,
we're about to get married,

362
00:16:47,178 --> 00:16:49,745
and I-I want a clean slate.

363
00:16:49,748 --> 00:16:51,013
No secrets.

364
00:16:51,015 --> 00:16:52,382
Really?
Be-Because to me,

365
00:16:52,383 --> 00:16:54,117
it seems like
we're about to get married

366
00:16:54,119 --> 00:16:55,418
and you're trying
to sabotage it.

367
00:16:55,421 --> 00:16:56,868
W-Would you rather
I didn't tell you?

368
00:16:56,869 --> 00:16:58,576
No, I don't want there
to be secrets between us.

369
00:16:58,600 --> 00:16:59,813
See, now I'm confused.

370
00:16:59,815 --> 00:17:01,315
I mean, what-what
am I supposed to do?

371
00:17:01,316 --> 00:17:04,051
Uh, keep your mouth
off other women.

372
00:17:04,052 --> 00:17:06,352
I can do that.

373
00:17:06,355 --> 00:17:07,955
Uh, uh, f-from now on,

374
00:17:07,956 --> 00:17:10,791
this mouth—
you and food, that's it.

375
00:17:13,262 --> 00:17:15,329
Okay.

376
00:17:15,330 --> 00:17:17,430
Yeah?

377
00:17:19,401 --> 00:17:21,801
Look, I'm not happy
this happened,

378
00:17:21,803 --> 00:17:23,670
but I think
I can get past it.

379
00:17:23,673 --> 00:17:25,673
I mean, we weren't
engaged at the time,

380
00:17:25,675 --> 00:17:27,140
and it was just kissing.

381
00:17:27,142 --> 00:17:28,408
Right.

382
00:17:28,410 --> 00:17:30,878
Just kissing.

383
00:17:30,879 --> 00:17:32,879
It wasn't even very good.

384
00:17:32,881 --> 00:17:34,715
She was a smoker.
I'd just been seasick...

385
00:17:34,716 --> 00:17:36,215
Okay, that's enough.
Stop talking.

386
00:17:40,656 --> 00:17:43,490
So...

387
00:17:43,492 --> 00:17:46,459
we're still
getting married?

388
00:17:46,462 --> 00:17:48,128
Yes.

389
00:17:49,865 --> 00:17:51,365
Because we love each other.

390
00:17:51,367 --> 00:17:53,067
Yes.

391
00:17:53,069 --> 00:17:56,337
And it's the happiest day
of our lives.

392
00:17:56,339 --> 00:17:57,804
Don't push it.

393
00:18:09,973 --> 00:18:11,071
Hello.

394
00:18:11,073 --> 00:18:12,240
Hello.

395
00:18:12,242 --> 00:18:14,841
Listen, I've been
thinking a lot

396
00:18:14,843 --> 00:18:16,176
about relationships

397
00:18:16,178 --> 00:18:19,446
and how difficult they can be,
and I think...

398
00:18:19,448 --> 00:18:21,682
I've been thinking
about them, too, Sheldon.

399
00:18:23,186 --> 00:18:26,253
Being your girlfriend
is so challenging.

400
00:18:26,255 --> 00:18:27,655
Emotionally,

401
00:18:27,657 --> 00:18:29,756
physically.

402
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:33,293
I've been incredibly patient
for years.

403
00:18:34,129 --> 00:18:35,830
Strongly disagree.

404
00:18:35,831 --> 00:18:37,598
Go on.

405
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:40,967
Okay, well...

406
00:18:40,969 --> 00:18:45,039
this isn't easy to say,
because I love you,

407
00:18:45,041 --> 00:18:46,773
but...

408
00:18:46,775 --> 00:18:50,544
I need some time
to take a step back

409
00:18:50,547 --> 00:18:53,680
and reevaluate our situation.

410
00:18:55,217 --> 00:18:56,818
Oh.

411
00:18:56,820 --> 00:19:00,053
I hope you understand.

412
00:19:02,891 --> 00:19:04,157
Okay.

413
00:19:05,395 --> 00:19:07,594
Bye, Sheldon.

414
00:19:25,849 --> 00:19:28,014
Well, Gollum...

415
00:19:29,819 --> 00:19:33,154
you're an expert on rings.

416
00:19:33,156 --> 00:19:34,888
What do I do with this one?

417
00:19:39,488 --> 00:19:45,988
