2
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:04,686
I like your suit.

3
00:00:04,688 --> 00:00:07,239
Oh, thanks. Got a couple
new outfits for work.

4
00:00:07,241 --> 00:00:09,191
How does it feel knowing
your fiancée's job

5
00:00:09,193 --> 00:00:11,326
is to go out
and flirt with doctors,

6
00:00:11,328 --> 00:00:14,029
looking like that,
while you sit here, you know...

7
00:00:14,031 --> 00:00:16,081
looking like this?

8
00:00:16,083 --> 00:00:18,700
She doesn't flirt with doctors.

9
00:00:18,702 --> 00:00:20,836
Yeah. It's all
very professional.

10
00:00:20,838 --> 00:00:22,955
You know when you bend over,
I can see down your shirt?

11
00:00:22,957 --> 00:00:24,756
Okay, good.

12
00:00:24,758 --> 00:00:27,342
Speaking of new careers,
how are things going

13
00:00:27,344 --> 00:00:29,294
with dark matter,
Sheldon?

14
00:00:29,296 --> 00:00:31,964
Oh, yeah, I'd have to say
it's the most exiting time

15
00:00:31,966 --> 00:00:33,799
in the history of the field.
Oh.

16
00:00:33,801 --> 00:00:34,801
What's going on?

17
00:00:34,802 --> 00:00:37,352
I started doing it.

18
00:00:37,354 --> 00:00:38,554
KOOTHRAPPALI:
You know, the government funded

19
00:00:38,556 --> 00:00:41,306
the biggest experiment yet
to detect dark matter.

20
00:00:41,308 --> 00:00:42,691
Oh, yeah,

21
00:00:42,693 --> 00:00:44,977
I've read about that...
they're sending research teams

22
00:00:44,979 --> 00:00:47,479
down into abandoned salt mines.
You know, Sheldon,

23
00:00:47,481 --> 00:00:49,615
if we apply to be
one of those teams,

24
00:00:49,617 --> 00:00:52,117
we could be on the ground floor
of something big...

25
00:00:52,119 --> 00:00:54,736
not just for theoretical physics
but for astrophysics as well.

26
00:00:54,738 --> 00:00:57,789
Wait, hang on... you guys
are gonna work in a mine?

27
00:00:57,791 --> 00:00:58,991
Why not?
You had

28
00:00:58,993 --> 00:01:01,877
a panic attack when
we went through the car wash.

29
00:01:01,879 --> 00:01:04,830
Perhaps the emotion
you're referring to was shock

30
00:01:04,832 --> 00:01:07,416
at you having something cleaned.

31
00:01:08,469 --> 00:01:10,702
I think what Penny meant is,
the thought of you two

32
00:01:10,704 --> 00:01:14,473
in a mine is kind of funny...
it's like a cat riding a Roomba.

33
00:01:14,475 --> 00:01:15,540
(laughs)

34
00:01:15,542 --> 00:01:17,009
If they get scared,
they'll have those hats

35
00:01:17,011 --> 00:01:18,677
with the lights on them,
'cause down there

36
00:01:18,679 --> 00:01:21,513
it's night-night all the time!

37
00:01:21,515 --> 00:01:22,614
Maybe they could

38
00:01:22,616 --> 00:01:24,650
ride around in one of
those mine carts that go,

39
00:01:24,652 --> 00:01:27,235
(squeakily):
Ee-oo-ee-oo-ee-oo.

40
00:01:27,237 --> 00:01:31,356
Yeah, it'll help them get away
when they see a gh-gh-ghost...!

41
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:34,776
Are they making fun of us?
Yup.

42
00:01:34,778 --> 00:01:37,696

53
00:02:07,393 --> 00:02:09,894
So, one of my favorite
video games of all time

54
00:02:09,896 --> 00:02:12,413
is called Shadow of the Colossus,
and it was only

55
00:02:12,415 --> 00:02:13,648
for PlayStation 2,

56
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:15,566
but then they came out
with a new version

57
00:02:15,568 --> 00:02:16,868
for PS3 with better graphics.

58
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:18,653
I finally got the chance
to play it,

59
00:02:18,655 --> 00:02:22,190
and for some reason, it just
wasn't as good as the first one.

60
00:02:26,579 --> 00:02:29,247
Or something about yoga.

61
00:02:29,249 --> 00:02:32,216
I'm sorry...
I was thinking about work.

62
00:02:32,218 --> 00:02:34,635
Well, I was just saying that
there was this video game...

63
00:02:34,637 --> 00:02:37,171
Yeah, that's when I started
thinking about work.

64
00:02:37,173 --> 00:02:39,640
Uh, listen, I've got
some good news.

65
00:02:39,642 --> 00:02:41,642
Hmm.

66
00:02:41,644 --> 00:02:43,261
This is for you.

67
00:02:43,263 --> 00:02:44,929
Huh.

68
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,367
What is this?

69
00:02:49,369 --> 00:02:51,302
Well, you know how
they gave me the company car?

70
00:02:51,304 --> 00:02:53,604
Didn't make sense to have two,
so I sold the other one.

71
00:02:53,606 --> 00:02:55,356
The one I gave you?

72
00:02:55,358 --> 00:02:57,909
Yeah. And there's your money
back... and now we're even.

73
00:02:57,911 --> 00:03:00,244
(laughs):
How great is that?

74
00:03:00,246 --> 00:03:02,446
Uh, yeah.

75
00:03:02,448 --> 00:03:04,248
What?

76
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:06,250
Nothing.

77
00:03:06,252 --> 00:03:09,003
Oh, come on, Leonard, I know
the car was a thoughtful gesture

78
00:03:09,005 --> 00:03:10,254
and I really appreciate it,

79
00:03:10,256 --> 00:03:12,089
but it doesn't make sense
to have both.

80
00:03:12,091 --> 00:03:14,008
You're right.
What should I have done?

81
00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:17,461
Taken a picture of us in the car
and put it in a pink frame

82
00:03:17,463 --> 00:03:21,816
with puffy paint around it
that says “best fiancé ever”?

83
00:03:23,269 --> 00:03:25,469
Doesn't sound that bad.

84
00:03:25,471 --> 00:03:27,805
Well, good, because...
that's why I did!

85
00:03:27,807 --> 00:03:29,056
Aw...

86
00:03:30,393 --> 00:03:31,926
Oh...

87
00:03:31,928 --> 00:03:32,977
thank you.

88
00:03:32,979 --> 00:03:34,528
That-that is so sweet.
No, it's not

89
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:36,314
that sweet...
I paid for the frame

90
00:03:36,316 --> 00:03:38,566
with your money
and then got a massage.

91
00:03:38,568 --> 00:03:41,986
You know what, you don't
have to give me this.

92
00:03:41,988 --> 00:03:43,287
You keep it.

93
00:03:43,289 --> 00:03:44,488
Why?
The car

94
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:46,107
was a gift... it was something
you needed.

95
00:03:46,109 --> 00:03:47,541
I was happy to
help you out.

96
00:03:47,543 --> 00:03:50,378
And I really appreciate it,
but now I don't need it,

97
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:52,630
so... here you go.
Well,

98
00:03:52,632 --> 00:03:54,415
this is silly... so you
don't need the car,

99
00:03:54,417 --> 00:03:56,300
but you could use it to buy
yourself something else,

100
00:03:56,302 --> 00:04:00,538
like a... new purse to
put all this money in.

101
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:01,923
Sweetie, I can buy my own stuff.

102
00:04:01,925 --> 00:04:03,307
I have a good job now.

103
00:04:03,309 --> 00:04:04,775
I know, and I'm
proud of you,

104
00:04:04,777 --> 00:04:06,644
but that doesn't mean I
can't do something nice.

105
00:04:06,646 --> 00:04:09,647
Like this.

106
00:04:09,649 --> 00:04:11,682
Okay, I don't want this
to turn into a fight.

107
00:04:11,684 --> 00:04:12,817
I don't, either.
Great.

108
00:04:12,819 --> 00:04:14,769
Thank you.

109
00:04:17,407 --> 00:04:19,523
Can you pass the salt, please?
Sure.

110
00:04:25,615 --> 00:04:28,649
In my mind, that broke
the tension with comedy

111
00:04:28,651 --> 00:04:30,618
and led to sex.

112
00:04:31,838 --> 00:04:34,505
(clears throat)

113
00:04:35,708 --> 00:04:37,825
Hey, Sheldon, you busy?

114
00:04:37,827 --> 00:04:39,710
I'm always busy.

115
00:04:39,712 --> 00:04:43,047
This mind is capable
of advanced multitasking.

116
00:04:43,049 --> 00:04:44,015
You know, currently,

117
00:04:44,017 --> 00:04:45,349
I'm attempting to solve

118
00:04:45,351 --> 00:04:46,550
the Penrose conjecture,

119
00:04:46,552 --> 00:04:49,186
I'm composing
my Nobel acceptance speech

120
00:04:49,188 --> 00:04:51,689
for when I've solved
the Penrose conjecture,

121
00:04:51,691 --> 00:04:54,909
and I'm wondering
how mermaids have babies.

122
00:04:56,179 --> 00:04:58,896
Don't they lay eggs on a rock?

123
00:05:00,116 --> 00:05:02,533
Now I've got room
for another thing.

124
00:05:02,535 --> 00:05:03,985
What do you want?

125
00:05:03,987 --> 00:05:06,704
So, I did a little
research on what

126
00:05:06,706 --> 00:05:08,539
the conditions are like
in the mines,

127
00:05:08,541 --> 00:05:10,041
and the guys might be right...

128
00:05:10,043 --> 00:05:11,409
sounds pretty rough
down there.

129
00:05:11,411 --> 00:05:13,377
For starters, it's very humid,

130
00:05:13,379 --> 00:05:15,162
and about a hundred degrees.

131
00:05:15,164 --> 00:05:17,999
Well, I'm from Texas
and you're from India...

132
00:05:18,001 --> 00:05:22,136
we're no strangers
to the fragrant armpit. Next.

133
00:05:22,138 --> 00:05:25,823
It's also a live mine, so
there'll be dynamite explosions

134
00:05:25,825 --> 00:05:28,092
going off in the distance.
Yeah, I have

135
00:05:28,094 --> 00:05:29,927
a lactose-intolerant roommate

136
00:05:29,929 --> 00:05:32,980
with a taste
for ice cream. Next.

137
00:05:32,982 --> 00:05:35,933
Oh, you have to be down there
for 12 hours at a time.

138
00:05:35,935 --> 00:05:38,686
Yeah? We have to be somewhere.

139
00:05:38,688 --> 00:05:39,854
Well, there's no toilets...

140
00:05:39,856 --> 00:05:41,605
we'll have to do our business
in a bucket.

141
00:05:41,607 --> 00:05:44,692
So it's settled...
we're not doing it.

142
00:05:46,279 --> 00:05:48,913
Look, I get it, but...
before we pass up

143
00:05:48,915 --> 00:05:51,565
on an incredible opportunity,
I was thinking about

144
00:05:51,567 --> 00:05:53,751
when Howard was training
to go to space,

145
00:05:53,753 --> 00:05:55,703
they put him
in a simulated environment.

146
00:05:55,705 --> 00:05:59,006
Interesting. You're
suggesting that we recreate

147
00:05:59,008 --> 00:06:00,841
the conditions
of the mine

148
00:06:00,843 --> 00:06:03,260
to see if we can handle it.
Exactly.

149
00:06:03,262 --> 00:06:05,296
Very well.
So where should we do it?

150
00:06:05,298 --> 00:06:08,632
Well, I'll just Google
“hot, dark and moist,”

151
00:06:08,634 --> 00:06:11,802
see what comes up.

152
00:06:12,638 --> 00:06:14,021
Uh, Sheldon...

153
00:06:14,023 --> 00:06:16,991
Oh, there, well, look,
there's all kinds of videos.

154
00:06:19,479 --> 00:06:20,611
(knocking)

155
00:06:20,613 --> 00:06:21,979
Hey, you got a sec?

156
00:06:21,981 --> 00:06:23,314
Hi. Sure.

157
00:06:23,316 --> 00:06:25,032
I was hoping we could talk
about the money again.

158
00:06:25,034 --> 00:06:27,818
Oh, sweetie, just forget about it.
No, no, no, no,

159
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:30,488
hear me out. I know things
got a little weird last night.

160
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:33,741
Well, leaving an envelope full
of cash on my dresser after sex

161
00:06:33,743 --> 00:06:36,377
would count as weird.

162
00:06:36,379 --> 00:06:39,747
Well, I think I came up
with a pretty good solution.

163
00:06:39,749 --> 00:06:40,455
Mm.

164
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:42,609
Why don't we just put the money
in a joint account?

165
00:06:42,718 --> 00:06:44,385
It'll be our first
money together.

166
00:06:44,387 --> 00:06:46,637
We can use it for the wedding,
the honeymoon, whatever.

167
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:48,589
You know what, that's great.
I love that!

168
00:06:48,591 --> 00:06:52,476
Yeah, of course you do...
I'm not just a genius in bed.

169
00:06:59,685 --> 00:07:03,020
(feminine voice):
You sure are, baby.

170
00:07:03,856 --> 00:07:06,357
You two want to be alone?

171
00:07:06,359 --> 00:07:09,243
I want you to know I get
why you don't want the money...

172
00:07:09,245 --> 00:07:10,945
you've got this new job,
you're excited

173
00:07:10,947 --> 00:07:12,613
about being financially
independent...

174
00:07:12,615 --> 00:07:14,665
and I am nothing
but proud of you.

175
00:07:14,667 --> 00:07:16,033
Oh, thank you so much.

176
00:07:16,035 --> 00:07:18,119
It feels so good
to hear you say that.

177
00:07:18,121 --> 00:07:19,336
And I want you
to know

178
00:07:19,338 --> 00:07:21,205
that I get this job
kind of changes

179
00:07:21,207 --> 00:07:22,706
the balance in our relationship,

180
00:07:22,708 --> 00:07:25,126
and... I'm trying
to be sensitive to that.

181
00:07:27,130 --> 00:07:29,547
What?

182
00:07:29,549 --> 00:07:32,049
Well, I just think that
maybe you're a little hung up

183
00:07:32,051 --> 00:07:34,602
on the money because
I'm less reliant on you now,

184
00:07:34,604 --> 00:07:36,053
and that's a little scary.

185
00:07:36,889 --> 00:07:39,223
Hmm.

186
00:07:39,225 --> 00:07:40,908
Maybe.

187
00:07:42,061 --> 00:07:45,229
Or maybe I tried
to do something nice

188
00:07:45,231 --> 00:07:47,698
and maybe you had
a problem with it

189
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:50,417
because of your control issues.

190
00:07:51,921 --> 00:07:53,821
Control issues?

191
00:07:53,823 --> 00:07:56,574
Maybe.

192
00:07:56,576 --> 00:07:58,876
Or... maybe...

193
00:07:58,878 --> 00:08:01,078
now that I'm no longer
an out-of-work actress

194
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:03,130
who can't pay
for her own dinner,

195
00:08:03,132 --> 00:08:05,249
that makes you
a little insecure.

196
00:08:05,251 --> 00:08:06,851
Well, I can't believe
you'd say that.

197
00:08:06,853 --> 00:08:10,604
You know how insecure I am
about my insecurities.

198
00:08:12,091 --> 00:08:13,674
You know what?
I'm sorry.

199
00:08:13,676 --> 00:08:15,509
It's stupid
to fight over money.

200
00:08:15,511 --> 00:08:17,578
Yeah, I'm sorry, too.
We're about to share

201
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:19,013
the rest of our lives together.

202
00:08:19,015 --> 00:08:21,315
It's our money...
who cares who has it?

203
00:08:21,317 --> 00:08:24,185
Ugh! You're right...
who cares? Mm.

204
00:08:25,021 --> 00:08:27,154
Get that money
out of my back pocket

205
00:08:27,156 --> 00:08:29,523
or I will break your fingers.

206
00:08:31,611 --> 00:08:33,611
Huh. All this time
I never knew

207
00:08:33,613 --> 00:08:35,279
there were steam tunnels
down here.

208
00:08:35,281 --> 00:08:37,164
Most universities
have them.

209
00:08:37,166 --> 00:08:39,950
When I was an undergrad,
I spent three days in one

210
00:08:39,952 --> 00:08:41,368
pledging a sorority.

211
00:08:42,255 --> 00:08:44,271
Did you get in?

212
00:08:44,273 --> 00:08:45,789
No. They forgot I was there.

213
00:08:45,791 --> 00:08:48,259
But it really opened up
my pores.

214
00:08:49,545 --> 00:08:51,128
Well, according
to my research,

215
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:54,098
the steam tunnels
below this access point

216
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:57,351
should be the closest
analog to the mines.

217
00:08:57,353 --> 00:08:58,769
This is gonna be
so much more accurate

218
00:08:58,771 --> 00:08:59,887
than the steam room at the gym.

219
00:08:59,889 --> 00:09:01,138
Plus, there's almost no chance

220
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:03,857
we'll see any
of our coworkers half naked.

221
00:09:03,859 --> 00:09:07,111
Or totally naked.
I love Howard,

222
00:09:07,113 --> 00:09:09,230
but the dude needs
a little shame.

223
00:09:09,232 --> 00:09:12,650
All right, Amy, this
walkie-talkie is yours.

224
00:09:12,652 --> 00:09:15,152
If we run into any problems,
I'll contact you.

225
00:09:15,154 --> 00:09:17,321
And if anything bad happens,
what's the rule?

226
00:09:17,323 --> 00:09:20,908
Save you first; Come back
for Raj only if there's time.

227
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:23,494
We're going
to be fine.

228
00:09:23,496 --> 00:09:25,496
(exhales)
Sheldon, I'm really impressed

229
00:09:25,498 --> 00:09:27,248
you're willing to try this.

230
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:28,999
Well, admittedly,
this brushes up

231
00:09:29,001 --> 00:09:32,386
against my well-known aversions
to heat, small places,

232
00:09:32,388 --> 00:09:33,971
going below floor-level,

233
00:09:33,973 --> 00:09:36,340
dampness, hatches,
ladders,

234
00:09:36,342 --> 00:09:38,225
darkness, echoes,

235
00:09:38,227 --> 00:09:41,645
and eliminating in
Home Depot buckets.

236
00:09:41,647 --> 00:09:44,348
That last one is quite new,
but I have a feeling

237
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:46,767
that's gonna rocket
to the top of the list.

238
00:09:59,635 --> 00:10:03,554
KOOTHRAPPALI (grunts):
I'm sweating already.

239
00:10:03,556 --> 00:10:08,642
Yeah, as the person beneath you,
allow me to say, I know.

240
00:10:11,681 --> 00:10:13,514
How hot is it?

241
00:10:13,516 --> 00:10:16,183
Uh, let's see.
704?

242
00:10:16,185 --> 00:10:18,602
No, wait, it's on “clock.”

243
00:10:18,604 --> 00:10:21,021
No, the real answer
isn't much better.

244
00:10:21,023 --> 00:10:23,190
102 degrees.

245
00:10:23,192 --> 00:10:24,525
Well, that's what we wanted.

246
00:10:24,527 --> 00:10:26,240
This is as hot
as the mines will be.

247
00:10:26,264 --> 00:10:27,279
True.

248
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:32,366
Sheldon's Mine Simulation Log,
entry one.

249
00:10:32,368 --> 00:10:35,035
Koothrappali's restating
of the obvious

250
00:10:35,037 --> 00:10:37,788
is already getting on my nerves.

251
00:10:40,209 --> 00:10:41,842
Thanks again
for having us.

252
00:10:41,844 --> 00:10:44,512
Oh, of course. What did
you guys want to talk about?

253
00:10:44,514 --> 00:10:46,514
Well, you know, now
that we're engaged,

254
00:10:46,516 --> 00:10:50,017
we had some questions about how
you handle money as a couple.

255
00:10:50,019 --> 00:10:53,554
I told you they weren't gonna
ask us to swing with them.

256
00:10:55,725 --> 00:10:57,057
I didn't think
they were going to.

257
00:10:57,059 --> 00:10:58,642
I just wanted to have
a way to say no

258
00:10:58,644 --> 00:11:00,694
without hurting
Leonard's feelings.

259
00:11:01,731 --> 00:11:04,565
Well... nailed it.

260
00:11:04,567 --> 00:11:06,066
So what did you
want to know?

261
00:11:06,068 --> 00:11:09,119
Well, do you guys ever
fight over money?

262
00:11:09,121 --> 00:11:10,621
Sure, sometimes.

263
00:11:10,623 --> 00:11:11,789
I mean, it can be
a little awkward

264
00:11:11,791 --> 00:11:14,408
since I make so much more money
than Howie.

265
00:11:15,294 --> 00:11:18,495
You didn't have to say
“so much more.”

266
00:11:18,497 --> 00:11:20,080
Well, I didn't have to,
but for the sake of accuracy

267
00:11:20,082 --> 00:11:22,216
I felt that I should.

268
00:11:23,052 --> 00:11:24,718
I brought a lot of
significant assets

269
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,287
into the
relationship, too.

270
00:11:26,289 --> 00:11:30,424
Like what? Your incomplete set
of Star Trek collector plates?

271
00:11:31,527 --> 00:11:32,743
For your information,
I just bought the last one

272
00:11:32,745 --> 00:11:35,062
I needed on eBay.

273
00:11:35,064 --> 00:11:36,747
Without asking me?

274
00:11:36,749 --> 00:11:39,833
There were only three minutes
left in the auction

275
00:11:39,835 --> 00:11:44,188
and it was a mint condition
Scotty from a smoke-free home.

276
00:11:46,442 --> 00:11:47,408
How much, Howie?

277
00:11:47,410 --> 00:11:48,359
Not a lot.

278
00:11:48,361 --> 00:11:50,261
How much?

279
00:11:50,263 --> 00:11:53,447
Let's not talk about this
in front of our friends.

280
00:11:53,449 --> 00:11:56,951
Was it more or less
than falconry school?

281
00:11:58,704 --> 00:12:03,307
For the tenth time,
that was a Groupon.

282
00:12:04,126 --> 00:12:06,310
Like I would swing
with him.

283
00:12:09,215 --> 00:12:10,798
(panting)

284
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,683
How you feeling?

285
00:12:12,685 --> 00:12:14,118
Good.

286
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:16,971
Little claustrophobic.

287
00:12:16,973 --> 00:12:18,355
Let's set up
the equipment.

288
00:12:18,357 --> 00:12:20,641
It'll help take
your mind off of it.

289
00:12:20,643 --> 00:12:24,695
Miners often sang mining songs
to keep their spirits up.

290
00:12:24,697 --> 00:12:26,447
Do you know any
mining songs?

291
00:12:26,449 --> 00:12:28,482
Just the hits.

292
00:12:28,484 --> 00:12:32,152

a little Miley Cyrus next?

312
00:13:25,174 --> 00:13:26,840
Who's he?

313
00:13:30,546 --> 00:13:32,763
(stammers)
Talk about wasted money.

314
00:13:32,765 --> 00:13:35,099
What about the late fees
on our credit card

315
00:13:35,101 --> 00:13:36,800
because somebody didn't pay
the bill on time?

316
00:13:36,802 --> 00:13:38,102
Well, maybe I would have paid it

317
00:13:38,104 --> 00:13:40,637
if I wasn't also doing
everything else around here.

318
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:42,856
Oh, you're saying I don't do
anything around here.

319
00:13:44,643 --> 00:13:47,945
Look at my chore chart.

320
00:13:47,947 --> 00:13:51,398
She made him a chore chart.
I see it.

321
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:54,902
“Do the dishes.”
There's a star right there.

322
00:13:54,904 --> 00:13:57,905
That was a pity star. Putting
water in the roasting pan

323
00:13:57,907 --> 00:14:00,874
and leaving it in the sink
is not doing the dishes.

324
00:14:00,876 --> 00:14:05,079
That pan had to soak
and you know it.

325
00:14:05,081 --> 00:14:07,164
Well, don't come crying to me

326
00:14:07,166 --> 00:14:08,882
when you don't get
your allowance.

327
00:14:09,752 --> 00:14:10,801
It's not an allowance.

328
00:14:10,803 --> 00:14:12,086
It's a stipend!

329
00:14:12,088 --> 00:14:14,004
And we said we weren't gonna
call it an allowance

330
00:14:14,006 --> 00:14:15,339
in front of my friends.

331
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,426
(door slams)

332
00:14:19,428 --> 00:14:22,262
I usually don't like
lemon bars,

333
00:14:22,264 --> 00:14:24,765
but Th-these are really good.

334
00:14:26,902 --> 00:14:30,771
So, as Hannah
Montana, Miley

335
00:14:30,773 --> 00:14:32,356
was a world-famous pop star.

336
00:14:32,358 --> 00:14:34,358
But then she would take off
her wig and go to school

337
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:35,576
like a
normal girl.

338
00:14:35,578 --> 00:14:36,610
Which, I don't have to tell you,

339
00:14:36,612 --> 00:14:39,613
at that age,
is its own headache.

340
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:41,915
That's preposterous.

341
00:14:41,917 --> 00:14:45,035
How would she go unrecognized
just by wearing a wig?

342
00:14:45,037 --> 00:14:47,121
But you're okay with Superman
concealing his identity

343
00:14:47,123 --> 00:14:48,372
with a pair of glasses?

344
00:14:48,374 --> 00:14:50,290
He doesn't just put on a pair
of glasses.

345
00:14:50,292 --> 00:14:51,925
He combs back his curlicue

346
00:14:51,927 --> 00:14:55,095
and affects
a mild-mannered personality.

347
00:14:55,097 --> 00:14:57,464
AMY: You guys doing
okay down there?

348
00:14:57,466 --> 00:15:00,517
I told you to use
the walkie-talkie!

349
00:15:00,519 --> 00:15:04,972
You guys doing okay down there?

350
00:15:04,974 --> 00:15:09,560
Please keep this channel clear
for emergencies. Thank you.

351
00:15:09,562 --> 00:15:13,280
I'm going to the vending
machine. Do you want anything?

352
00:15:13,282 --> 00:15:15,899
This is a simulation.
We have to survive

353
00:15:15,901 --> 00:15:17,234
on the supplies we brought.

354
00:15:17,236 --> 00:15:19,820
Okay, just checking.

355
00:15:19,822 --> 00:15:22,790
We should have asked her
to get some Funyuns.

356
00:15:22,792 --> 00:15:24,708
You're not going to have Funyuns

357
00:15:24,710 --> 00:15:27,044
when we're a mile
below the surface of the Earth.

358
00:15:27,046 --> 00:15:28,829
What if we brought them down
with us?

359
00:15:29,665 --> 00:15:32,332
We'll take some Funyuns.

360
00:15:32,334 --> 00:15:34,334
Anything else?

361
00:15:34,336 --> 00:15:37,004
Some York Peppermint Patties,

362
00:15:37,006 --> 00:15:38,672
a couple
of Dr. Peppers, and...

363
00:15:38,674 --> 00:15:41,425
run to Best Buy and see if
they have a portable DVD player

364
00:15:41,427 --> 00:15:45,062
and season one of a show
called Hannah Montana.

365
00:15:45,064 --> 00:15:47,431
Have her get season two.

366
00:15:47,433 --> 00:15:50,350
Season one,
it was still finding itself.

367
00:15:51,437 --> 00:15:53,854
Sorry you guys had to see that.
Oh,

368
00:15:53,856 --> 00:15:55,189
don't apologize.
Yeah.

369
00:15:55,191 --> 00:15:58,575
It just makes it a lot harder
to pretend it never happened.

370
00:15:58,577 --> 00:16:00,694
Money's a sensitive subject
for Howie

371
00:16:00,696 --> 00:16:02,663
because of the difference
in our income.

372
00:16:02,665 --> 00:16:03,914
It really bothers him?

373
00:16:03,916 --> 00:16:05,165
Well, sure.
There's still a lot of pressure

374
00:16:05,167 --> 00:16:06,533
on guys to be providers.

375
00:16:06,535 --> 00:16:08,502
So even though
he's happy for me,

376
00:16:08,504 --> 00:16:10,304
it's just a little tough on him.

377
00:16:10,306 --> 00:16:12,005
Uh-oh.
What?

378
00:16:12,007 --> 00:16:13,207
Well,

379
00:16:13,209 --> 00:16:14,374
if I do well in sales,

380
00:16:14,376 --> 00:16:16,210
I could end up making a
lot more money than you.

381
00:16:16,212 --> 00:16:18,212
Not a problem.
I grew up with a mother

382
00:16:18,214 --> 00:16:19,880
who emasculated
my father financially

383
00:16:19,882 --> 00:16:22,299
and in every other aspect
of his life, so...

384
00:16:23,569 --> 00:16:26,720
really, it's what I think
love looks like.

385
00:16:28,157 --> 00:16:30,524
I'll be right back.
I'm gonna go check on him.

386
00:16:32,778 --> 00:16:34,432
Maybe it's a good
thing we came here.

387
00:16:34,433 --> 00:16:36,469
It's like a lesson
in what not to do.

388
00:16:36,470 --> 00:16:39,233
Yeah I don't want something dumb
like money to come between us.

389
00:16:39,235 --> 00:16:41,401
It won't. Let's just promise
to figure this kind of stuff out

390
00:16:41,403 --> 00:16:42,486
before we get married.

391
00:16:42,488 --> 00:16:44,872
WOLOWITZ: Why are you
being so bossy?

392
00:16:44,874 --> 00:16:46,773
BERNADETTE: Why are you
being a baby?

393
00:16:46,775 --> 00:16:49,376
WOLOWITZ: I'm not a baby!
I'm a grown man,

394
00:16:49,378 --> 00:16:52,913
and I made the bed.
Now where's my star?

395
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:57,134
Should we go?
Hang on.

396
00:16:57,136 --> 00:16:59,887
I want to see if
he gets the star.

397
00:17:02,057 --> 00:17:05,142
Oh, this heat is brutal.

398
00:17:05,144 --> 00:17:07,644
As someone from the tropical
subcontinent of India,

399
00:17:07,646 --> 00:17:10,147
you should know that fanning
yourself in a humid environment

400
00:17:10,149 --> 00:17:12,683
only raises
your body temperature.

401
00:17:12,685 --> 00:17:15,652
Huh. That does explain why
the servants used to look so hot

402
00:17:15,654 --> 00:17:17,404
while they were fanning me.

403
00:17:17,406 --> 00:17:21,158
Let's get our minds off
how uncomfortable we are.

404
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:23,493
We could take some more
simulated instrument readings.

405
00:17:23,495 --> 00:17:24,778
My major focus

406
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:27,497
at the moment is keeping
my claustrophobia at bay.

407
00:17:27,499 --> 00:17:29,082
How's that going?
You tell me.

408
00:17:29,084 --> 00:17:30,951
I feel like I can't breathe,

409
00:17:30,953 --> 00:17:33,620
and I am tempted
to crack you open

410
00:17:33,622 --> 00:17:36,590
and suck the air
right out of your lungs.

411
00:17:37,509 --> 00:17:40,177
Sheldon, if this is
too much, we can stop.

412
00:17:40,179 --> 00:17:41,261
We're not stopping.

413
00:17:41,263 --> 00:17:43,046
You don't have to
bite my head off.

414
00:17:43,048 --> 00:17:44,631
I apologize.

415
00:17:44,633 --> 00:17:46,016
I j...

416
00:17:46,018 --> 00:17:48,936
I'm plagued
by an internal struggle.

417
00:17:48,938 --> 00:17:50,637
If you would just use
the bucket,

418
00:17:50,639 --> 00:17:53,106
you'd be
so much more comfortable.

419
00:17:53,108 --> 00:17:56,226
My struggle is emotional.

420
00:17:56,228 --> 00:17:57,978
Oh. Is it Amy?

421
00:17:57,980 --> 00:18:00,147
It's dark matter.

422
00:18:00,149 --> 00:18:02,382
When I entered
the field

423
00:18:02,384 --> 00:18:04,818
of string theory,
I was a prodigy.

424
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:08,905
I rose to a position of respect,

425
00:18:08,907 --> 00:18:11,291
and I assumed
my career would continue

426
00:18:11,293 --> 00:18:13,360
on that upward trajectory.

427
00:18:13,362 --> 00:18:16,163
Now here I am in my 30s,

428
00:18:16,165 --> 00:18:19,166
I'm back at square one.

429
00:18:19,168 --> 00:18:22,686
And, frankly, it's frightening.

430
00:18:23,789 --> 00:18:27,140
Sheldon, you know
what I think of when I'm scared?

431
00:18:27,142 --> 00:18:28,508
Voyager.

432
00:18:28,510 --> 00:18:30,727
Voyager the space probe

433
00:18:30,729 --> 00:18:34,514
or Voyager
the Star Trek TV show?

434
00:18:34,516 --> 00:18:35,983
The space probe.

435
00:18:35,985 --> 00:18:37,601
Good.
Because I am too hot and tired

436
00:18:37,603 --> 00:18:40,854
to go on about how much
I hate Voyager the TV show.

437
00:18:42,074 --> 00:18:43,857
By the time
I was born,

438
00:18:43,859 --> 00:18:46,276
Voyager 1's mission
was supposed to be over.

439
00:18:46,278 --> 00:18:47,411
It had seen

440
00:18:47,413 --> 00:18:50,497
Jupiter and Saturn
and all their moons,

441
00:18:50,499 --> 00:18:52,866
but it kept going.

442
00:18:54,036 --> 00:18:55,669
When I left India for America,

443
00:18:55,671 --> 00:18:58,338
I was never more scared
in my life.

444
00:18:58,340 --> 00:19:00,707
I had no idea
what lay ahead.

445
00:19:00,709 --> 00:19:03,477
Whenever I feel that way,
I think about how...

446
00:19:03,479 --> 00:19:07,381
Voyager is still out there

447
00:19:07,383 --> 00:19:10,017
somewhere
beyond our solar system,

448
00:19:10,019 --> 00:19:12,886
going further than anyone
ever thought it could.

449
00:19:16,191 --> 00:19:18,975
Don't leave!
You can do this!

450
00:19:20,813 --> 00:19:22,863
Sheldon,
is everything okay?

451
00:19:22,865 --> 00:19:24,398
It's too late for Koothrappali.

452
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,415
Let's go!

453
00:19:27,870 --> 00:19:31,738
11 minutes.
That's longer than I thought.

454
00:19:32,574 --> 00:19:34,041
KOOTHRAPPALI:
They're in my shirt!

455
00:19:45,023 --> 00:19:47,357
Okay, this is definitely
the most fun thing we can do

456
00:19:47,359 --> 00:19:48,525
with the money.

457
00:19:51,363 --> 00:19:55,482
I've never done it on
a big old pile of cash before.

458
00:19:57,486 --> 00:20:02,072
(high-pitched): “Me neither, Leonard.
It's my first time, too.”

459
00:20:05,544 --> 00:20:08,662
I'm so sorry I made you feel bad
about the money stuff.

460
00:20:08,664 --> 00:20:11,848
It's okay.
No, it's not okay.

461
00:20:11,850 --> 00:20:14,167
I want us to be
partners, equals.

462
00:20:14,169 --> 00:20:16,920
Adults in a mature
relationship.

463
00:20:16,922 --> 00:20:19,089
I want that, too.

464
00:20:20,476 --> 00:20:22,676
Now, let's talk about
your birthday party.

465
00:20:22,678 --> 00:20:25,178
Ooh, laser tag, laser tag.
Oh!

466
00:20:27,232 --> 00:20:29,599
Do you really need me
to transcribe this?

467
00:20:29,601 --> 00:20:30,901
You're not doing it for me.

468
00:20:30,903 --> 00:20:32,903
You're doing it
for future generations

469
00:20:32,905 --> 00:20:35,572
who will benefit
from my struggle.

470
00:20:36,792 --> 00:20:39,276
Sheldon's Mine Simulation Log,

471
00:20:39,278 --> 00:20:41,778
entry four:

472
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:45,615
My Kit Kat has melted.

473
00:20:45,617 --> 00:20:49,119
All is lost.

474
00:20:49,121 --> 00:20:51,671
You call yourself
a friend?

475
00:20:51,673 --> 00:20:52,873
I was trying

476
00:20:52,875 --> 00:20:55,208
to help you!
And at the first sign of trouble

477
00:20:55,210 --> 00:21:00,380
you ran away, leaving me
to fend off a family of rats!

478
00:21:00,382 --> 00:21:02,616
You're a completely selfish
human being

479
00:21:02,618 --> 00:21:06,453
and a... and a physical
and a moral coward!

480
00:21:07,756 --> 00:21:09,856
His statements of the obvious
continue to annoy.

481
