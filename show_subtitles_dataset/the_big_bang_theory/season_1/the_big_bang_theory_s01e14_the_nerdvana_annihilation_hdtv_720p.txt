1
00:00:00,976 --> 00:00:03,871
This sandwich is
an unmitigated disaster.

2
00:00:04,624 --> 00:00:08,261
I asked for turkey and roast beef
with lettuce and Swiss on whole wheat.

3
00:00:08,423 --> 00:00:10,558
- What did they give you?
- Turkey and roast beef

4
00:00:10,678 --> 00:00:12,777
with Swiss and lettuce on whole wheat.

5
00:00:18,563 --> 00:00:21,148
It's the right ingredients,
but in the wrong order.

6
00:00:22,236 --> 00:00:23,483
In a proper sandwich,

7
00:00:23,645 --> 00:00:25,406
the cheese is adjacent to the bread

8
00:00:25,526 --> 00:00:28,206
to create a moisture barrier
against the lettuce.

9
00:00:29,125 --> 00:00:32,243
They might as well have dragged
this thing through a car wash.

10
00:00:32,939 --> 00:00:36,121
- I don't believe it.
- I know. It's basic culinary science.

11
00:00:36,747 --> 00:00:39,249
Some guy is auctioning off
a miniature Time Machine prop

12
00:00:39,412 --> 00:00:41,837
from the original film,
and no one is bidding on it.

13
00:00:41,998 --> 00:00:44,755
A time machine
from the movie <i>The Time Machine</i>?

14
00:00:45,238 --> 00:00:47,676
No. A time machine
from <i>Sophie's Choice</i>.

15
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:51,066
Boy, Sophie could have used
a time machine in that movie.

16
00:00:51,186 --> 00:00:52,952
Did you see it? It's rough.

17
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:57,154
- That's cool.
- It's only $800?

18
00:00:57,274 --> 00:00:58,842
Yeah. And that's my bid.

19
00:00:58,962 --> 00:01:00,396
You bid $800?

20
00:01:00,557 --> 00:01:03,462
It was a spur-of-the-moment thing.
I figured it would go for thousands,

21
00:01:03,582 --> 00:01:05,483
and I just wanted to be a part of it.

22
00:01:05,647 --> 00:01:07,523
There's only 30 sec left in the auction.

23
00:01:07,643 --> 00:01:08,779
Do you have $800?

24
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:11,156
Not to blow on a miniature time machine.

25
00:01:11,322 --> 00:01:13,615
Don't worry. People wait
until the last second to bid,

26
00:01:13,735 --> 00:01:15,702
and they swoop in and get it.
It's called sniping.

27
00:01:15,865 --> 00:01:16,913
15 seconds.

28
00:01:17,073 --> 00:01:18,676
Come on, snipers.

29
00:01:20,261 --> 00:01:21,766
10, 9,

30
00:01:22,372 --> 00:01:24,299
- 8...
- Where are your snipers?

31
00:01:24,666 --> 00:01:25,688
- 5...
- Snipe.

32
00:01:25,808 --> 00:01:26,831
- 4...
- Snipe.

33
00:01:26,951 --> 00:01:27,974
- 3...
- Snipe!

34
00:01:28,094 --> 00:01:29,231
- 2...
- Snipe!

35
00:01:29,351 --> 00:01:30,164
1...

36
00:01:31,319 --> 00:01:32,345
Congratulations!

37
00:01:32,507 --> 00:01:34,972
You are the proud owner
of a miniature time machine!

38
00:01:36,425 --> 00:01:37,790
You lucky duck.

39
00:01:38,221 --> 00:01:39,803
I wonder why no one else bid.

40
00:01:39,923 --> 00:01:42,393
This is a classic piece
of sci-fi movie memorabilia.

41
00:01:42,513 --> 00:01:45,857
- Yeah, I know! I still can't afford it.
- Why don't we share it?

42
00:01:46,023 --> 00:01:49,027
We'll each put in 200 bucks,
we'll take turns having it in our house.

43
00:01:49,190 --> 00:01:50,854
A time-share time machine.

44
00:01:52,445 --> 00:01:53,759
I'm in. Sheldon?

45
00:01:53,879 --> 00:01:55,035
Need you ask?

46
00:01:55,645 --> 00:01:58,037
I still don't understand
why no one else bid.

47
00:02:07,247 --> 00:02:09,703
I understand
why no one else bid.

48
00:02:11,585 --> 00:02:14,064
Episode 114: The Nerdvana Annihilation

49
00:02:15,511 --> 00:02:18,266
Transcript: swsub.com
Sync: sub-way.fr | italiansubs.net

50
00:02:37,029 --> 00:02:39,413
Did the listing actually
say "miniature"?

51
00:02:41,626 --> 00:02:43,054
I just assumed.

52
00:02:44,537 --> 00:02:47,702
Who sells a full-size
time machine for $800?

53
00:02:48,624 --> 00:02:51,492
In a Venn diagram,
that would be an individual located

54
00:02:51,612 --> 00:02:54,688
within the intersection of the sets
"No longer want my time machine"

55
00:02:54,808 --> 00:02:56,126
and "Need $800."

56
00:02:57,716 --> 00:02:59,544
It's actually a tremendous bargain.

57
00:02:59,664 --> 00:03:02,921
Even with shipping, it works out
to less than four dollars a pound.

58
00:03:04,092 --> 00:03:05,825
Cocktail shrimp are $12.50.

59
00:03:08,604 --> 00:03:10,509
How are we going to get it upstairs?

60
00:03:11,981 --> 00:03:14,697
If we take the dish off,
it might fit in the elevator.

61
00:03:14,858 --> 00:03:17,238
Yes, but the elevator
has been broken for 2 years.

62
00:03:17,358 --> 00:03:18,808
I've been meaning to ask you.

63
00:03:18,928 --> 00:03:21,205
Do you think we should
make a call about that?

64
00:03:22,825 --> 00:03:25,841
Not necessary.
I have a Master's in engineering.

65
00:03:25,961 --> 00:03:28,712
I remotely repair satellites
on a regular basis.

66
00:03:29,091 --> 00:03:31,720
I troubleshoot space shuttle payloads.

67
00:03:32,494 --> 00:03:34,926
When the Mars Rover started
pulling to the left,

68
00:03:35,046 --> 00:03:37,227
I performed a front-end alignment

69
00:03:37,347 --> 00:03:39,611
from 62 million miles away.

70
00:03:49,724 --> 00:03:51,400
No. That baby's broken.

71
00:03:54,359 --> 00:03:55,724
Come on, guys! Push!

72
00:03:55,844 --> 00:03:59,178
If I push any harder,
I'm going to give birth to my colon.

73
00:04:00,227 --> 00:04:02,141
I can't feel my fingers. Hurry up!

74
00:04:02,261 --> 00:04:04,616
It's the same amount of work
no matter how fast you go.

75
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:06,368
- Basic physics.
- Sheldon?

76
00:04:07,036 --> 00:04:10,358
If my fingers ever work again,
I've got a job for the middle one.

77
00:04:12,047 --> 00:04:14,218
- Hey, guys.
- Hi, Penny.

78
00:04:17,178 --> 00:04:18,574
Take a break, guys.

79
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:23,350
- What are you doing?
- We're just moving something upstairs.

80
00:04:23,675 --> 00:04:25,103
- What is it?
- Just...

81
00:04:25,802 --> 00:04:27,364
You know. Time machine.

82
00:04:28,729 --> 00:04:30,606
Neat. But I really got to get to work.

83
00:04:30,768 --> 00:04:33,692
- Give us a few minutes.
- I don't have them. I'm running late.

84
00:04:33,854 --> 00:04:35,510
Then, I have a simple solution.

85
00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:37,758
Go up to the roof.
Hop over to the next building.

86
00:04:37,878 --> 00:04:40,310
There's a small gap, don't look down
if you're subject to vertigo,

87
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:41,993
and use their stairwell.

88
00:04:42,755 --> 00:04:43,954
You're joking, right?

89
00:04:44,114 --> 00:04:46,347
I never joke when it comes to vertigo.

90
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:51,036
Damn. Okay, I'll just take the roof.

91
00:04:51,789 --> 00:04:53,809
If you wait for us
to set up the time machine,

92
00:04:53,929 --> 00:04:55,943
I can drop you off at work yesterday.

93
00:04:57,837 --> 00:04:59,845
Time travel joke.
It's not... never mind.

94
00:05:02,098 --> 00:05:04,422
For what it's worth,
I thought it was humorous.

95
00:05:08,363 --> 00:05:09,728
Let's just do this.

96
00:05:10,068 --> 00:05:12,449
- You guys ready to push?
- In a minute.

97
00:05:12,569 --> 00:05:14,483
Howard stepped outside to throw up.

98
00:05:20,192 --> 00:05:21,948
I don't know
what you were worried about.

99
00:05:22,068 --> 00:05:23,910
I think it really works in the room.

100
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:29,095
It is by far the coolest thing
I have ever owned.

101
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:32,127
The exact time machine
that carried actor Rod Taylor

102
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:35,175
from Victorian England
into the post-apocalyptic future,

103
00:05:35,295 --> 00:05:37,451
where society had splintered
into two factions:

104
00:05:37,571 --> 00:05:40,241
the subterranean Morlocks,
who survived by feasting

105
00:05:40,361 --> 00:05:42,857
on the flesh of the gentle
surface-dwelling Eloi.

106
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,387
Talk about your chick magnets.

107
00:05:50,833 --> 00:05:52,801
The guy who lives next to me
is always like,

108
00:05:52,921 --> 00:05:56,268
"I have a Jacuzzi on my balcony.
I have a Jacuzzi on my balcony."

109
00:05:56,388 --> 00:05:57,759
But wait until I tell him,

110
00:05:57,879 --> 00:05:59,979
"I've got a time machine
on my balcony.

111
00:06:01,650 --> 00:06:04,063
Stuff that in your Speedoes,
Jacuzzi Bob."

112
00:06:05,404 --> 00:06:08,135
Gentlemen, we said we'd take turns,
but I think you'll agree

113
00:06:08,255 --> 00:06:10,874
that practicality
dictates it remain here.

114
00:06:11,203 --> 00:06:13,488
You can't keep it here.
What if I meet a girl and say,

115
00:06:13,608 --> 00:06:15,374
"You wanna come up and see
my time machine?

116
00:06:15,494 --> 00:06:17,812
It's at my friends' house."
How lame is that?

117
00:06:18,489 --> 00:06:19,631
He's got a point.

118
00:06:19,751 --> 00:06:22,922
I think we're going to need some ground
rules; in addition to the expected

119
00:06:23,042 --> 00:06:25,800
"no shoes in the time machine,"
and "no eating in the time machine,"

120
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:29,795
I propose we add "pants must be worn
at all times in the time machine."

121
00:06:30,892 --> 00:06:31,882
Seconded.

122
00:06:33,129 --> 00:06:34,900
I was going to put down a towel.

123
00:06:38,654 --> 00:06:40,165
I still want it on my balcony.

124
00:06:40,285 --> 00:06:42,613
I say we move it on a bi-monthly basis.

125
00:06:42,775 --> 00:06:45,741
- That sounds fair.
- Bi-monthly is an ambiguous term.

126
00:06:45,903 --> 00:06:47,744
It's every other month or twice a month?

127
00:06:47,905 --> 00:06:49,570
- Twice a month.
- Then no.

128
00:06:49,690 --> 00:06:51,487
- Okay, every other month.
- No.

129
00:06:53,167 --> 00:06:54,626
You can't be selfish.

130
00:06:54,787 --> 00:06:57,127
We all paid for it,
so it belongs to all of us.

131
00:06:57,290 --> 00:06:59,839
Now get out of the way
so I can sit in my time machine.

132
00:07:09,886 --> 00:07:13,791
I am setting the dials
for March 10, 1876.

133
00:07:14,139 --> 00:07:16,497
Good choice, Alexander Graham Bell
invents the telephone

134
00:07:16,617 --> 00:07:18,707
- and calls out for Dr. Watson.
- Wait a minute.

135
00:07:18,827 --> 00:07:21,403
- I'd want to see that, too.
- So when it's your turn, you can.

136
00:07:21,563 --> 00:07:23,367
But if we all go back to the same point,

137
00:07:23,487 --> 00:07:26,365
Bell's lab is going to get very crowded.
He'll know something's up.

138
00:07:27,518 --> 00:07:29,535
Also since the time machine
doesn't move in space,

139
00:07:29,696 --> 00:07:31,820
you'll end up in 1876 Pasadena.

140
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:34,473
And even if you can make it to Boston,
are you going knock on the door

141
00:07:34,593 --> 00:07:36,670
and say to Mrs. Bell,
"Big fan of your husband.

142
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:39,013
"Can I come in and watch him
invent the telephone?"

143
00:07:39,706 --> 00:07:42,341
Mrs. Bell was deaf.
She's not even going to hear you knock.

144
00:07:43,686 --> 00:07:46,251
I have a solution.
First, go into the future

145
00:07:46,371 --> 00:07:49,180
- and obtain a cloaking device.
- How far into the future?

146
00:07:49,341 --> 00:07:52,094
If I remember correctly, Captain Kirk
will steal a cloaking device

147
00:07:52,214 --> 00:07:55,195
from the Romulans on Stardate 5027.3,

148
00:07:55,315 --> 00:07:58,556
which would be January 10, 2328
by pre-Federation reckoning.

149
00:08:01,191 --> 00:08:04,886
I am setting the dials
for January 10, 2328.

150
00:08:05,495 --> 00:08:07,876
Here we go into the future.

151
00:08:29,503 --> 00:08:30,551
That was fun.

152
00:08:31,909 --> 00:08:32,808
My turn!

153
00:08:34,363 --> 00:08:35,833
Okay, first of all,

154
00:08:35,953 --> 00:08:38,455
what you call a gap
was nearly three feet wide.

155
00:08:38,575 --> 00:08:40,669
- I slipped and skinned my knee.
- Are you okay?

156
00:08:41,625 --> 00:08:44,461
Second of all, the door to the stairwell
of the other building was locked,

157
00:08:44,581 --> 00:08:47,196
so I had to go down the fire escape,
which ends on the 3d floor,

158
00:08:47,357 --> 00:08:50,332
forcing me to crawl through the window
of a lovely Armenian family

159
00:08:50,452 --> 00:08:52,319
who insisted I stay for lunch.

160
00:08:53,671 --> 00:08:56,332
- That doesn't sound too bad.
- It was eight courses of lamb,

161
00:08:56,452 --> 00:08:58,547
and they tried to fix me up
with their son.

162
00:09:00,761 --> 00:09:01,961
- Sorry.
- Not done.

163
00:09:02,122 --> 00:09:04,797
By the time I finally got to work,
they'd given my shift away.

164
00:09:04,958 --> 00:09:08,300
That's right. I lost an entire day's pay
thanks to this.

165
00:09:08,462 --> 00:09:10,135
- This...
- Time machine.

166
00:09:13,746 --> 00:09:16,222
The lights flash and the dish spins.
You want to try it?

167
00:09:17,555 --> 00:09:18,852
I don't want to try it!

168
00:09:19,015 --> 00:09:21,074
My God, you are grown men!

169
00:09:21,379 --> 00:09:25,132
How can you waste your lives
with these stupid toys and costumes

170
00:09:25,252 --> 00:09:27,988
and comic books
and now that?! That...

171
00:09:28,149 --> 00:09:29,646
Again. Time machine.

172
00:09:32,069 --> 00:09:34,846
Please, it's not a time machine.
If anything, it looks like something

173
00:09:34,966 --> 00:09:37,496
Elton John would drive
through the Everglades.

174
00:09:43,353 --> 00:09:45,334
It only moves in time.

175
00:09:45,454 --> 00:09:47,959
It would be worse than useless
in a swamp.

176
00:09:53,534 --> 00:09:55,230
Pathetic! All of you!

177
00:09:55,350 --> 00:09:57,035
Completely pathetic!

178
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:03,406
My turn!

179
00:10:20,366 --> 00:10:22,347
Leonard, it's 2:00 in the morning.

180
00:10:23,506 --> 00:10:24,324
So?

181
00:10:24,485 --> 00:10:26,121
So it's my turn.

182
00:10:29,086 --> 00:10:31,573
Why did you set it
for the day before yesterday?

183
00:10:31,966 --> 00:10:33,852
Because I want to go back
and keep myself

184
00:10:33,972 --> 00:10:35,460
from getting a time machine.

185
00:10:35,633 --> 00:10:36,528
You can't.

186
00:10:36,648 --> 00:10:38,890
If you were to prevent yourself
from buying it in the past,

187
00:10:39,010 --> 00:10:41,271
you wouldn't have it available
in the present to travel back

188
00:10:41,391 --> 00:10:43,759
and stop yourself from buying it.
Ergo, you would still have it.

189
00:10:43,932 --> 00:10:46,229
This is a classic rookie
time-travel mistake.

190
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:52,686
Can I go back and prevent you
from explaing that to me?

191
00:10:53,424 --> 00:10:54,450
Same paradox.

192
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:57,273
If you were to travel back in time
and, say, knock me unconscious,

193
00:10:57,446 --> 00:10:59,704
you would not then have the conversation
that irritated you,

194
00:10:59,824 --> 00:11:02,529
motivating you to go back
and knock me unconscious.

195
00:11:03,792 --> 00:11:06,199
What if I knocked you
unconscious right now?

196
00:11:07,674 --> 00:11:09,370
It won't change the past.

197
00:11:11,212 --> 00:11:13,498
But it'd make the present so much nicer.

198
00:11:14,875 --> 00:11:16,733
Are you upset about something?

199
00:11:17,416 --> 00:11:19,055
What was your first clue?

200
00:11:19,942 --> 00:11:21,682
Well, it was a number of things.

201
00:11:21,802 --> 00:11:23,068
First, the late hour.

202
00:11:23,188 --> 00:11:25,187
Then your demeanor
seems very low-energy,

203
00:11:25,307 --> 00:11:27,440
- plus your irritability.
- Yes, I'm upset!

204
00:11:28,292 --> 00:11:30,578
I don't usually pick
up on those things.

205
00:11:31,243 --> 00:11:32,288
Good for me.

206
00:11:35,566 --> 00:11:36,692
Good for you.

207
00:11:37,664 --> 00:11:38,521
Wait.

208
00:11:40,644 --> 00:11:42,913
Did you want to talk about
what's bothering you?

209
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:46,989
- I don't know. Maybe.
- I'm on fire tonight.

210
00:11:52,513 --> 00:11:53,762
Here's the thing.

211
00:11:54,325 --> 00:11:58,175
Girls like Penny never end up
with guys who own time machines.

212
00:11:58,804 --> 00:11:59,893
I disagree.

213
00:12:00,169 --> 00:12:02,544
Your inability to
successfully woo Penny

214
00:12:02,664 --> 00:12:05,183
long predates your acquisition
of the time machine.

215
00:12:07,891 --> 00:12:09,989
That failure clearly
stands on its own.

216
00:12:11,639 --> 00:12:14,790
- Thanks for pointing it out.
- In addition, your premise is flawed.

217
00:12:14,912 --> 00:12:17,489
In the original film,
Rod Taylor got Yvette Mimieux

218
00:12:17,609 --> 00:12:19,272
with that very time machine.

219
00:12:19,445 --> 00:12:21,936
In <i>Back to the Future</i>,
Marty McFly got the opportunity

220
00:12:22,056 --> 00:12:24,660
to hook up with his extremely
attractive young mother.

221
00:12:27,626 --> 00:12:30,318
- Those are movies.
- Of course they're movies.

222
00:12:30,438 --> 00:12:32,449
Were you expecting me to come up
with an example

223
00:12:32,569 --> 00:12:34,645
involving a real-life time machine?

224
00:12:36,918 --> 00:12:38,075
That's absurd.

225
00:12:40,316 --> 00:12:41,612
Come on, guys, push!

226
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:45,046
If I push any harder, I'm going
to give birth to my colon.

227
00:12:47,272 --> 00:12:48,982
- Hey, guys.
- Hi, Penny.

228
00:12:52,337 --> 00:12:53,939
Take a break, guys!

229
00:12:55,043 --> 00:12:59,043
- What are you doing?
- You know, just moving a time machine.

230
00:13:00,431 --> 00:13:02,524
Neat, but I really gotta get to work.

231
00:13:03,121 --> 00:13:04,328
No problem.

232
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,207
Hang on.

233
00:13:13,468 --> 00:13:15,360
But... what about your time machine?

234
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:18,081
Some things are more
important than toys.

235
00:13:26,736 --> 00:13:27,900
I'm scared.

236
00:13:28,407 --> 00:13:30,238
Don't worry, baby. I've got you.

237
00:13:52,213 --> 00:13:53,984
It's still my turn.

238
00:13:59,564 --> 00:14:00,867
What are you doing?

239
00:14:02,127 --> 00:14:03,871
I'm packing up all my collectibles

240
00:14:03,991 --> 00:14:06,564
and taking them down
to the comic book store to sell.

241
00:14:06,905 --> 00:14:08,538
Was that really necessary?

242
00:14:08,799 --> 00:14:11,451
If you need money,
you can always sell blood.

243
00:14:12,919 --> 00:14:14,043
And semen.

244
00:14:15,881 --> 00:14:17,337
This is not about money.

245
00:14:17,571 --> 00:14:18,925
We brought food!

246
00:14:19,147 --> 00:14:21,951
Lox and bagels, the
breakfast of time-travelers.

247
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:25,023
Terrific. Does anyone want to buy
my share of the time machine?

248
00:14:25,195 --> 00:14:27,411
- Why?
- I don't want it anymore.

249
00:14:27,531 --> 00:14:29,736
- Why?
- Just... personal reasons.

250
00:14:29,908 --> 00:14:32,948
My Spidey sense tells me this
has something to do with Penny.

251
00:14:33,367 --> 00:14:35,714
Look, do you want to
buy me out or not?

252
00:14:35,834 --> 00:14:38,115
I'll give you $100,
which will make me half-owner

253
00:14:38,235 --> 00:14:39,753
and we'll put it on my balcony.

254
00:14:39,873 --> 00:14:42,665
Screw his balcony. I'll give you
$120 and we'll put it in my garage.

255
00:14:42,964 --> 00:14:44,668
I paid $200 for my share.

256
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:47,405
Dude, everybody knows a time
machine loses half its value

257
00:14:47,525 --> 00:14:49,515
the minute you drive
it off the lot.

258
00:14:49,893 --> 00:14:52,633
I'll go for $200. That time
machine stays right where it is.

259
00:14:52,806 --> 00:14:56,594
$300 and I'll throw in my original
1979 Mattel Millennium Falcon

260
00:14:56,714 --> 00:14:58,431
with real light speed sound effects.

261
00:14:58,788 --> 00:15:02,158
No. No more toys or action figures

262
00:15:02,411 --> 00:15:05,490
or props or replicas
or costumes or robots

263
00:15:05,610 --> 00:15:07,295
or Darth Vader voice changers.

264
00:15:07,415 --> 00:15:08,941
I'm getting rid of all of it.

265
00:15:09,102 --> 00:15:11,412
You can't do that. Look
what you've created here.

266
00:15:11,532 --> 00:15:13,236
It's like nerdvana.

267
00:15:16,561 --> 00:15:19,619
More importantly,
you have a Darth Vader voice changer?

268
00:15:21,341 --> 00:15:22,633
Not for long.

269
00:15:22,753 --> 00:15:24,441
I call dibs on <i>The Golden Age Flash</i>.

270
00:15:24,561 --> 00:15:27,202
I need that to complete my
<i>Justice Society of America</i> collection.

271
00:15:27,322 --> 00:15:29,655
- Too bad. I called dibs.
- You can't just call dibs.

272
00:15:29,775 --> 00:15:32,256
I can and I did.
Look up "Dibs" in Wikipedia.

273
00:15:32,935 --> 00:15:34,858
Dibs doesn't apply
in a bidding war.

274
00:15:34,978 --> 00:15:36,385
It's not a bidding war.

275
00:15:36,558 --> 00:15:38,972
I'm selling it all to Larry
down at the comic book store.

276
00:15:39,144 --> 00:15:41,642
- Did Larry call dibs?
- Will you forget dibs?!

277
00:15:41,762 --> 00:15:44,087
He offered me a fair price
for the whole collection.

278
00:15:44,207 --> 00:15:48,036
- What's the number? I'll match it.
- I'll match it plus a thousand rupees.

279
00:15:48,463 --> 00:15:50,597
- What's the exchange rate?
- None of your business.

280
00:15:50,717 --> 00:15:52,110
Take it or leave it?

281
00:15:52,533 --> 00:15:54,801
Mom? My bar mitzvah bonds.
How much do I got?

282
00:15:55,026 --> 00:15:56,067
Thanks.

283
00:15:56,255 --> 00:15:58,630
I can go $2,600 and two trees in Israel.

284
00:16:00,965 --> 00:16:01,987
Forget it, guys.

285
00:16:02,107 --> 00:16:04,975
If I sell to one of you, the other two
are going to be really mad at me.

286
00:16:05,095 --> 00:16:07,385
Who cares? As long as you pick me!

287
00:16:08,335 --> 00:16:10,412
Okay, Leonard, put down the box.
Let's talk.

288
00:16:10,532 --> 00:16:12,457
Sorry, Raj. My mind is made up.

289
00:16:12,748 --> 00:16:13,565
No!

290
00:16:13,898 --> 00:16:15,926
I can't let you do this.

291
00:16:16,491 --> 00:16:17,969
Get out of my way.

292
00:16:21,607 --> 00:16:23,768
None shall pass!

293
00:16:28,889 --> 00:16:30,482
I did not want to do this,

294
00:16:30,819 --> 00:16:34,028
but I have here the rare mint
condition production error

295
00:16:34,148 --> 00:16:36,412
<i>Star Trek: The Next Generation</i>
Geordi La Forge

296
00:16:36,532 --> 00:16:38,990
without his visor
in the original packaging.

297
00:16:39,716 --> 00:16:41,649
If you do not get out of my way,

298
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:43,522
I will open it.

299
00:16:44,859 --> 00:16:46,662
Okay, man. Be cool.

300
00:16:47,718 --> 00:16:49,209
We're all friends here.

301
00:16:50,587 --> 00:16:52,087
What the hell's going on?

302
00:16:52,297 --> 00:16:53,747
You hypocrite!

303
00:16:54,298 --> 00:16:55,113
What?

304
00:16:55,278 --> 00:16:57,588
Little Miss "grown-ups
don't play with toys."

305
00:16:57,708 --> 00:17:01,262
If I were to go into that apartment now,
would I not find Beanie Babies?

306
00:17:01,435 --> 00:17:04,252
Are you not an accumulator
of Care Bears and My Little Ponies?

307
00:17:04,372 --> 00:17:07,393
And who is that Japanese feline
I see frolicking on your shorts?

308
00:17:07,815 --> 00:17:09,718
Hello, Hello Kitty!

309
00:17:14,067 --> 00:17:16,358
Okay, look, if this is about yesterday,
Leonard,

310
00:17:16,478 --> 00:17:19,071
I am really sorry about what I said.
I was just upset.

311
00:17:19,244 --> 00:17:22,264
- I need to hear it.
- No, you didn't. You are a great guy

312
00:17:22,384 --> 00:17:25,278
and it is the things you love
that make you who you are.

313
00:17:25,952 --> 00:17:28,509
I guess that makes
me "large breasts."

314
00:17:32,914 --> 00:17:35,949
Still, I think it's time for
me to get rid of this stuff

315
00:17:36,069 --> 00:17:38,140
and, you know,
move on with my life.

316
00:17:38,645 --> 00:17:40,486
- Really?
- Yeah.

317
00:17:42,273 --> 00:17:44,059
Well, good for you.

318
00:17:45,193 --> 00:17:46,150
Thanks.

319
00:17:48,297 --> 00:17:50,813
Do you want to...
I don't know, later...

320
00:17:50,992 --> 00:17:51,999
Excuse me.

321
00:17:52,694 --> 00:17:54,159
- Hey, Penny.
- Hi, Mike.

322
00:17:54,279 --> 00:17:56,220
- Ready to go?
- I just have to change.

323
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:58,639
- I'll give you a hand.
- Stop it!

324
00:17:58,982 --> 00:17:59,903
Bye, guys.

325
00:18:05,246 --> 00:18:06,846
My turn on the time machine!

326
00:18:30,731 --> 00:18:31,854
It worked.

327
00:18:33,704 --> 00:18:35,241
It really worked.

328
00:18:36,409 --> 00:18:39,190
They said I was mad, but it worked!

329
00:18:47,634 --> 00:18:48,963
Not Morlocks!

330
00:18:49,367 --> 00:18:51,566
Not flesh-eating Morlocks!

331
00:18:52,036 --> 00:18:53,895
Help!

332
00:19:02,284 --> 00:19:04,312
Sheldon, are you okay?

333
00:19:05,011 --> 00:19:07,254
We have to get rid
of the time machine.

334
00:19:07,608 --> 00:19:09,817
It is a little big
for the living room, isn't it?

335
00:19:10,869 --> 00:19:13,110
Yeah, that's the problem. It's too big.

336
00:19:13,915 --> 00:19:16,613
I'm glad you agree.
I hired some guys to help us move it.

337
00:19:16,733 --> 00:19:18,047
Come on in, fellas.

338
00:19:22,521 --> 00:19:23,575
Morlocks!
