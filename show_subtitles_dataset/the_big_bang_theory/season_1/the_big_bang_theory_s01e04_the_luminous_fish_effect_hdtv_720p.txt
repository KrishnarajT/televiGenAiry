1
00:00:01,127 --> 00:00:03,712
You know, I've been thinking
about timetravel again.

2
00:00:03,924 --> 00:00:06,471
Why? Did you hit a roadblock
with invisibility?

3
00:00:07,966 --> 00:00:09,326
Put it on a backburner.

4
00:00:10,339 --> 00:00:11,690
Anyway.
It occurs to me,

5
00:00:11,883 --> 00:00:13,599
If I have ever did
perfect time machine,

6
00:00:13,792 --> 00:00:15,760
I'd just go into the past
and give it to myself.

7
00:00:16,030 --> 00:00:19,329
That's eliminating the need for me
to invent it in the first place.

8
00:00:20,151 --> 00:00:21,173
Interesting.

9
00:00:21,364 --> 00:00:23,583
Yeah, it really kicks the pressure off.

10
00:00:24,546 --> 00:00:25,830
Sounds like a breakthrough.

11
00:00:26,003 --> 00:00:28,338
Should I call Science Magazine
and tell them to hold the cover?

12
00:00:28,809 --> 00:00:30,774
It's time travel,
I will have already done that.

13
00:00:32,938 --> 00:00:34,695
Then I guess congratulations
are in order.

14
00:00:35,242 --> 00:00:37,827
No, congratulations will
have been in order.

15
00:00:39,172 --> 00:00:41,155
You know, I am not going
to enjoy this party.

16
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:43,120
I know,
I'm familiar with you.

17
00:00:43,655 --> 00:00:46,388
The last department party,
Professor Finkleday cornered me

18
00:00:46,542 --> 00:00:48,819
and talked about
spelunking for 45 minutes.

19
00:00:49,015 --> 00:00:50,078
Yes, I was there.

20
00:00:50,233 --> 00:00:52,100
You know what's interesting
about caves?

21
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:53,643
- What?
- Nothing.

22
00:00:55,737 --> 00:00:58,080
Then we'll avoid him,
we'll meet the new department head,

23
00:00:58,215 --> 00:00:59,907
congratulate him,
shake his hand and go.

24
00:01:00,066 --> 00:01:02,754
How's this?
"Pleased to meet you, Dr. Gablehauser.

25
00:01:03,026 --> 00:01:04,839
"How fortunate for you
that the university's

26
00:01:04,976 --> 00:01:06,573
"chosen to hire you,
despite the fact

27
00:01:06,708 --> 00:01:08,936
"that you've done no original
research in 25 years,

28
00:01:09,071 --> 00:01:11,118
"and instead have written
a series of popular books

29
00:01:11,254 --> 00:01:12,990
"that reduce
the great concepts of science

30
00:01:13,127 --> 00:01:14,378
"to a series of anecdotes,

31
00:01:14,552 --> 00:01:16,765
"each one dumbed down
to accommodate the duration

32
00:01:16,958 --> 00:01:18,846
"of an average bowel movement.

33
00:01:20,283 --> 00:01:21,283
Mahalo."

34
00:01:25,045 --> 00:01:27,039
"Mahalo's" a nice touch.

35
00:01:28,158 --> 00:01:30,473
You know there only eight consonants
in Hawaiian language?

36
00:01:30,608 --> 00:01:32,711
Interesting.
You should lead with that.

37
00:01:35,293 --> 00:01:37,252
Oh, God, look at this buffet.

38
00:01:38,014 --> 00:01:39,266
I love America.

39
00:01:39,761 --> 00:01:41,191
You don't have buffets in India?

40
00:01:41,388 --> 00:01:43,663
Of course,
but it's all Indian food.

41
00:01:44,555 --> 00:01:47,082
You can't find a bagel
in Mumbai to save your life.

42
00:01:47,423 --> 00:01:48,423
Shmear me.

43
00:01:50,843 --> 00:01:53,602
- Here's an interesting turn of events.
- What?

44
00:01:56,484 --> 00:01:57,680
Howard brought a date?

45
00:01:57,808 --> 00:01:59,345
A more plausible explanation is that

46
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:00,869
his work in robotics has made

47
00:02:01,033 --> 00:02:02,519
an amazing leap forward.

48
00:02:03,459 --> 00:02:05,509
Hey, what up,
science bitches?

49
00:02:07,828 --> 00:02:08,908
May I introduce my

50
00:02:09,062 --> 00:02:10,644
special lady friend Summer?

51
00:02:10,932 --> 00:02:13,535
- I told you touching's extra.
- Right. Sorry.

52
00:02:15,345 --> 00:02:17,782
Here comes our new boss.
Be polite.

53
00:02:18,135 --> 00:02:20,484
Hi, fellas.
Eric Gablehauser.

54
00:02:20,705 --> 00:02:21,761
Howard Wolowitz.

55
00:02:22,649 --> 00:02:24,191
Nice to meet you.
And you are?

56
00:02:25,197 --> 00:02:27,083
An actual real scientist.

57
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:31,848
How was that?

58
00:02:33,664 --> 00:02:35,632
I can't believe he fired me.

59
00:02:36,497 --> 00:02:39,081
Well, you did call him
a glorified high school science teacher

60
00:02:39,254 --> 00:02:42,435
whose last successful experiment
was lighting his own farts.

61
00:02:43,993 --> 00:02:45,016
In my defense,

62
00:02:45,208 --> 00:02:47,619
I prefaced that by saying,
"With all due respect."

63
00:03:08,872 --> 00:03:10,758
Synchro: Sixe

64
00:03:13,266 --> 00:03:14,273
Morning.

65
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:15,620
Morning.

66
00:03:16,171 --> 00:03:17,967
You're making eggs for breakfast?

67
00:03:18,245 --> 00:03:20,675
This isn't breakfast,
it's an experiment.

68
00:03:22,866 --> 00:03:24,641
'Cause it looks a lot like breakfast.

69
00:03:25,164 --> 00:03:27,216
I finally have time
to test my hypothesis

70
00:03:27,413 --> 00:03:29,208
about the separation
of the water molecules

71
00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:32,303
from the egg proteins and its
impact vis-a-vis taste.

72
00:03:34,049 --> 00:03:35,049
Sounds yummy.

73
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:38,161
I look forward
to your work with bacon.

74
00:03:38,606 --> 00:03:39,606
As do I.

75
00:03:41,488 --> 00:03:43,437
You know, I'm sure
if you just apologize

76
00:03:43,649 --> 00:03:45,639
to Gablehauser,
he would give you your job back.

77
00:03:45,793 --> 00:03:47,009
I don't want my job back.

78
00:03:47,515 --> 00:03:49,294
I've spent the past
three and a half years

79
00:03:49,452 --> 00:03:51,299
staring at grease boards
full of equations.

80
00:03:51,495 --> 00:03:53,920
Before that, I spent four years
working on my thesis.

81
00:03:54,074 --> 00:03:55,486
Before that, I was in college,

82
00:03:55,621 --> 00:03:57,648
and before that,
I was in the fifth grade.

83
00:03:59,045 --> 00:04:02,637
This is my first day off in decades
and I'm going to savor it.

84
00:04:05,077 --> 00:04:07,065
I'll let you get back
to fixing your eggs.

85
00:04:07,348 --> 00:04:09,913
Not just fixing my eggs,
I'm fixing everyone's eggs.

86
00:04:10,751 --> 00:04:12,301
And we all thank you.

87
00:04:43,873 --> 00:04:45,725
Use new eggs.

88
00:04:50,293 --> 00:04:52,338
I'm running out to the market.
You need anything?

89
00:04:53,496 --> 00:04:55,230
This would be
one of those circumstances

90
00:04:55,378 --> 00:04:58,766
that people unfamiliar with the law of
large numbers would call a coincidence.

91
00:04:59,426 --> 00:05:00,931
- I'm sorry?
- I need eggs.

92
00:05:01,083 --> 00:05:02,486
Four dozen should suffice.

93
00:05:02,739 --> 00:05:03,852
- Four dozen?
- Yes,

94
00:05:04,002 --> 00:05:05,848
and evenly distributed
amongst brown, white,

95
00:05:06,003 --> 00:05:08,396
free-range, large,
extra large and jumbo.

96
00:05:09,265 --> 00:05:10,346
Okay, one more time.

97
00:05:10,597 --> 00:05:12,417
Never mind.
You won't get it right.

98
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:14,464
I'd better come with you.

99
00:05:21,552 --> 00:05:23,765
How come you didn't
go into work today?

100
00:05:23,858 --> 00:05:25,165
I'm taking a sabbatical

101
00:05:25,331 --> 00:05:27,802
because I won't kowtow
to mediocre minds.

102
00:05:28,463 --> 00:05:30,118
So you got canned, huh?

103
00:05:30,662 --> 00:05:33,209
Theoretical physicists
do not get canned...

104
00:05:34,215 --> 00:05:35,215
but yeah.

105
00:05:36,721 --> 00:05:38,033
Maybe it's all for the best.

106
00:05:38,173 --> 00:05:40,826
I always say when one door closes,
another one opens.

107
00:05:41,526 --> 00:05:42,798
No, it doesn't.

108
00:05:43,731 --> 00:05:46,000
Not unless the two doors
are connected by relays

109
00:05:46,154 --> 00:05:48,619
- or there are motion sensors involved.
- No, I meant...

110
00:05:48,754 --> 00:05:51,199
Or if the first door closing
creates a change of air pressure

111
00:05:51,334 --> 00:05:52,821
that acts upon the second door.

112
00:05:53,797 --> 00:05:54,797
Never mind.

113
00:05:56,516 --> 00:05:58,140
Slow down.

114
00:05:58,353 --> 00:06:00,620
- Please, slow down!
- We're fine!

115
00:06:00,766 --> 00:06:03,002
You're not leaving yourself
enough space between cars.

116
00:06:03,158 --> 00:06:05,891
- Oh, sure, I am.
- No, let me do the math for you.

117
00:06:06,011 --> 00:06:08,470
This car weighs,
let's say 4,000 pounds.

118
00:06:08,744 --> 00:06:10,615
Now add 140 for me,
120 for you...

119
00:06:10,971 --> 00:06:12,139
120?

120
00:06:12,525 --> 00:06:14,016
I'm sorry. Did I insult you?

121
00:06:14,209 --> 00:06:16,705
Is your body mass
somehow tied into your self-worth?

122
00:06:17,534 --> 00:06:18,557
Well, yeah.

123
00:06:19,384 --> 00:06:20,384
Interesting.

124
00:06:20,504 --> 00:06:22,408
Anyway, that gives us
a total weight of,

125
00:06:22,563 --> 00:06:24,140
let's say 4,400 pounds.

126
00:06:24,344 --> 00:06:25,577
Let's say 4,390.

127
00:06:26,458 --> 00:06:29,313
Fine. We're traveling forward at--

128
00:06:29,486 --> 00:06:31,203
good Lord-- 51 miles an hour.

129
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:33,219
Let's assume that your brakes

130
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:35,016
are new
and the calipers are aligned.

131
00:06:35,216 --> 00:06:36,839
Still, by the time we come
to a stop,

132
00:06:36,959 --> 00:06:39,529
we'll be occupying the same space
as that Buick in front of us,

133
00:06:39,722 --> 00:06:42,084
an impossibility that
nature will quickly resolve

134
00:06:42,253 --> 00:06:43,555
into death, mutilation...

135
00:06:43,710 --> 00:06:46,046
Oh, look, they built
a new putt-putt course.

136
00:06:49,730 --> 00:06:50,867
This is great.

137
00:06:51,382 --> 00:06:52,382
Look at me.

138
00:06:52,547 --> 00:06:54,367
I'm in the real world
of ordinary people

139
00:06:54,973 --> 00:06:57,879
just living their ordinary,
colorless workaday lives.

140
00:06:58,950 --> 00:06:59,953
Thank you.

141
00:07:00,146 --> 00:07:01,225
No, thankyou.

142
00:07:02,098 --> 00:07:03,991
And thank you, ordinary person.

143
00:07:06,429 --> 00:07:08,576
You want to hear
an interesting thing about tomatoes?

144
00:07:08,854 --> 00:07:10,034
No, not really.

145
00:07:10,206 --> 00:07:12,907
Listen, didn't you say
you need some eggs?

146
00:07:13,258 --> 00:07:16,435
Yes, but anyone who knows anything
about the dynamics of bacterial growth

147
00:07:16,589 --> 00:07:19,580
knows to pick up their refrigerated food
on the way out of the supermarket.

148
00:07:20,346 --> 00:07:22,563
Okay, then maybe you should start
heading on out then.

149
00:07:23,929 --> 00:07:25,548
No, this is fun.

150
00:07:25,956 --> 00:07:28,814
Oh, the thing about tomatoes--
and I think you'll really enjoy this--

151
00:07:29,093 --> 00:07:32,479
is they're shelved with the vegetables,
but they're technically a fruit.

152
00:07:32,691 --> 00:07:33,981
- Interesting.
- Isn't it?

153
00:07:34,142 --> 00:07:36,284
No, I mean
what you find enjoyable.

154
00:07:40,949 --> 00:07:41,949
Oh, boy.

155
00:07:43,757 --> 00:07:44,757
What now?

156
00:07:45,818 --> 00:07:48,217
Well, there's some value
to taking a multivitamin,

157
00:07:48,411 --> 00:07:50,494
but the human body
can only absorb so much.

158
00:07:50,675 --> 00:07:51,945
What you're buying here

159
00:07:52,179 --> 00:07:54,783
are the ingredients
for very expensive urine.

160
00:07:56,420 --> 00:07:58,970
Well, maybe that's what
I was going for.

161
00:07:59,444 --> 00:08:01,180
Then you'll want some manganese.

162
00:08:08,083 --> 00:08:09,541
That was fun.

163
00:08:09,661 --> 00:08:12,222
Maybe tomorrow we can go
to one of those big warehouse stores.

164
00:08:12,342 --> 00:08:13,518
Oh, I don't know.

165
00:08:13,719 --> 00:08:17,381
It's going to take me a while to recover
from all the fun I had today.

166
00:08:18,403 --> 00:08:19,403
Are you sure?

167
00:08:19,596 --> 00:08:21,533
There are a lot of advantages
to buying in bulk.

168
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:24,215
For example, I noticed
that you purchase your tampons

169
00:08:24,408 --> 00:08:25,820
one-month supply at a time.

170
00:08:28,521 --> 00:08:29,505
What?

171
00:08:30,105 --> 00:08:32,130
Think about it.
It's a product that doesn't spoil

172
00:08:32,282 --> 00:08:35,550
and you're going to be needing them
for at least the next 30 years.

173
00:08:36,279 --> 00:08:38,889
You want me to buy 30 years
worth of tampons?

174
00:08:39,693 --> 00:08:42,298
Well, 30, 35.
When did your mother go into menopause?

175
00:08:44,277 --> 00:08:45,917
I'm not talking
about this with you.

176
00:08:47,378 --> 00:08:48,806
This is a natural human process,

177
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:51,353
and we're talking about
statistically significant savings.

178
00:08:51,584 --> 00:08:55,289
Now, if you assume 15 tampons
per cycle and a 28-day cycle...

179
00:08:55,424 --> 00:08:56,948
Are you fairly regular?

180
00:09:02,118 --> 00:09:03,372
Okay, no warehouse store,

181
00:09:03,507 --> 00:09:05,630
but we're still on
for putt-putt golf, right?

182
00:09:11,845 --> 00:09:14,483
Hey, I just ran into Penny.
She seemed upset about something.

183
00:09:14,927 --> 00:09:16,991
I think it's her time of the month.

184
00:09:19,401 --> 00:09:21,832
I marked the calendar
for future reference.

185
00:09:25,211 --> 00:09:26,738
What's with the fish?

186
00:09:27,715 --> 00:09:29,165
It's an experiment.

187
00:09:30,576 --> 00:09:32,456
What happened
to your scrambled egg research?

188
00:09:32,627 --> 00:09:33,881
Oh, that was a dead end.

189
00:09:34,073 --> 00:09:36,871
Scrambled eggs are as good
as they're ever going to be.

190
00:09:37,529 --> 00:09:39,630
So... fish?

191
00:09:41,337 --> 00:09:43,265
I read an article
about Japanese scientists

192
00:09:43,427 --> 00:09:46,148
who inserted DNA from luminous
jellyfish into other animals,

193
00:09:46,415 --> 00:09:49,444
and I thought,
"Hey, fish nightlights."

194
00:09:52,998 --> 00:09:54,289
Fish nightlights?

195
00:09:54,653 --> 00:09:56,274
It's a billion-dollar idea.

196
00:09:58,807 --> 00:09:59,807
Mum's the word.

197
00:10:01,492 --> 00:10:02,977
Are you sure you don't want

198
00:10:03,112 --> 00:10:05,601
to just apologize to Gablehauser
and get your job back?

199
00:10:06,668 --> 00:10:08,135
No, I have too much to do.

200
00:10:09,518 --> 00:10:10,670
Like luminous fish.

201
00:10:11,634 --> 00:10:13,100
I'm sorry.
I didn't...

202
00:10:15,051 --> 00:10:16,324
That's just the beginning.

203
00:10:16,688 --> 00:10:17,888
I also have an idea

204
00:10:18,081 --> 00:10:20,688
for a bulk mail-order
feminine hygiene company.

205
00:10:20,893 --> 00:10:22,852
Oh, glow-in-the-dark tampons!

206
00:10:26,254 --> 00:10:28,106
Leonard, we're gonna be rich.

207
00:10:32,167 --> 00:10:34,085
Thanks for coming
on such short notice.

208
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:36,897
- You did the right thing calling.
- I didn't know what else to do.

209
00:10:37,051 --> 00:10:40,194
He's lost all focus.
Every day he's got a new obsession.

210
00:10:47,126 --> 00:10:49,576
This is a particularly disturbing one.

211
00:10:52,589 --> 00:10:53,589
Mommy?

212
00:10:54,743 --> 00:10:56,439
Hi, baby!

213
00:11:05,205 --> 00:11:08,408
Oh, you got yourself a loom?
How nice!

214
00:11:09,070 --> 00:11:10,070
Thank you.

215
00:11:10,253 --> 00:11:12,047
Honey, why'd you get a loom?

216
00:11:13,470 --> 00:11:16,171
I was working with luminous fish,
and I thought...

217
00:11:18,711 --> 00:11:19,676
"loom."

218
00:11:22,308 --> 00:11:24,276
Mom, what are you doing here?

219
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:25,814
Leonard called me.

220
00:11:26,326 --> 00:11:27,908
I know, but why?

221
00:11:28,373 --> 00:11:30,741
Because one of the great minds
of the 21st century

222
00:11:30,877 --> 00:11:34,118
is raising glow-in-the-dark fish
and weaving serapes.

223
00:11:35,064 --> 00:11:37,449
This is not a serape,
this is a poncho.

224
00:11:37,624 --> 00:11:39,721
A serape is open at the sides;
a poncho is closed.

225
00:11:39,850 --> 00:11:40,869
This is a poncho.

226
00:11:41,004 --> 00:11:43,743
And neither is a reason
to call someone'smother.

227
00:11:45,477 --> 00:11:47,731
Really? When was the last time
you left the house?

228
00:11:48,621 --> 00:11:50,049
I went to the market with Penny.

229
00:11:50,242 --> 00:11:51,715
That was three weeks ago.

230
00:11:52,139 --> 00:11:54,471
Well, then buckle up!
In the next four to eight days

231
00:11:54,626 --> 00:11:56,538
she's going to get very crabby.

232
00:11:59,065 --> 00:12:01,862
Sweetheart, your little friend
is concerned about you.

233
00:12:02,067 --> 00:12:04,384
Yes, well, I'm not a child--
I'm a grown man,

234
00:12:04,556 --> 00:12:06,539
capable of living my life as I see fit.

235
00:12:06,659 --> 00:12:09,696
And I certainly don't need someone
telling on me to my mother!

236
00:12:11,104 --> 00:12:12,416
Wait, where are you going?

237
00:12:12,589 --> 00:12:14,885
To my room.
And no one's allowed in!

238
00:12:17,443 --> 00:12:19,122
He gets his temper
from his daddy.

239
00:12:20,208 --> 00:12:21,288
He's got my eyes.

240
00:12:21,531 --> 00:12:22,553
I see.

241
00:12:22,974 --> 00:12:25,566
All that science stuff,
that comes from Jesus.

242
00:12:29,525 --> 00:12:32,110
- Sheldon, your mom made dinner.
- I'm not hungry!

243
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:35,185
Don't trouble yourself.
He's stubborn.

244
00:12:35,376 --> 00:12:37,261
He may stay in there till the Rapture.

245
00:12:39,133 --> 00:12:40,884
We so sure that's abadthing?

246
00:12:41,462 --> 00:12:43,081
I tell you,
I love the boy to death,

247
00:12:43,236 --> 00:12:46,624
but he has been difficult since
he fell out of me at the K-Mart.

248
00:12:49,204 --> 00:12:50,658
Excuse me for being so bold,

249
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:54,254
but I now see where Sheldon
gets his smoldering good looks.

250
00:12:56,153 --> 00:12:58,545
Honey, that ain't gonna work,
but you keep tryin'.

251
00:12:59,988 --> 00:13:01,163
I made chicken.

252
00:13:01,963 --> 00:13:05,904
I hope that isn't one of the animals
that you people think is magic.

253
00:13:12,008 --> 00:13:14,512
You know, we have an Indian
gentleman at our church,

254
00:13:14,724 --> 00:13:17,047
a Dr. Patel--
Tt's a beautiful story.

255
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:21,659
The Lord spoke to him and moved him
to give us all 20% off on Lasik--

256
00:13:21,812 --> 00:13:23,390
You know, those that needed it.

257
00:13:24,336 --> 00:13:25,670
That is a lovely story.

258
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,921
Are we gonna do anything about Sheldon?

259
00:13:28,077 --> 00:13:30,543
Oh, we will.
You have to take your time with Sheldon.

260
00:13:30,937 --> 00:13:33,156
His father, God rest his soul,
used to always say to me,

261
00:13:33,357 --> 00:13:36,097
"Mary, you have to take
your time with Sheldon."

262
00:13:37,390 --> 00:13:40,214
- Sounds like a wise man.
- Oh, not so wise.

263
00:13:40,407 --> 00:13:43,029
He once tried to fight a bobcat
for some licorice.

264
00:13:44,278 --> 00:13:46,343
So, everybody
grab a plate

265
00:13:46,617 --> 00:13:49,167
and a pretty place mat
that Shelly wove.

266
00:13:49,887 --> 00:13:51,961
Has Shelly ever freaked out
like this before?

267
00:13:52,121 --> 00:13:53,393
Oh, all the time.

268
00:13:53,663 --> 00:13:55,861
I remember one summer
when he was 13,

269
00:13:56,141 --> 00:13:58,726
he built a small nuclear
reactor in the shed

270
00:13:59,429 --> 00:14:02,626
and told everybody he was gonna provide
free electricity for the whole town.

271
00:14:02,793 --> 00:14:04,086
Well, the only problem was,

272
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:06,729
he had no what you call
"fissionable" materials.

273
00:14:08,001 --> 00:14:10,715
Anyway, when he went on the Internets
to get some,

274
00:14:10,934 --> 00:14:14,432
a man from the government
came by and sat him down

275
00:14:14,664 --> 00:14:17,107
real gentle, and told him
it's against the law

276
00:14:17,261 --> 00:14:19,112
to have yellow-cake uranium
in a shed.

277
00:14:20,602 --> 00:14:22,898
- What happened?
- Well, poor boy had a fit.

278
00:14:23,067 --> 00:14:26,038
Locked himself in his room
and built a sonic death ray.

279
00:14:27,204 --> 00:14:28,207
A death ray?

280
00:14:28,458 --> 00:14:31,621
That's what he called it.
Didn't even slow down the neighbor kids.

281
00:14:33,197 --> 00:14:35,087
It pissed our dog off to no end.

282
00:14:37,447 --> 00:14:39,496
You know, you two
make a cute couple.

283
00:14:41,366 --> 00:14:43,221
No. We're not...
we're not-not a couple.

284
00:14:43,368 --> 00:14:44,654
We're singles. Two singles.

285
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:48,139
Like those... individuly wrapped
slices of cheese that...

286
00:14:50,454 --> 00:14:51,657
We're friends.

287
00:14:53,195 --> 00:14:55,390
- Did I pluck a nerve there?
- Oh, yeah.

288
00:14:55,802 --> 00:14:57,654
All right, everybody,
it's time to eat.

289
00:14:59,037 --> 00:15:01,462
Oh, Lord,
we thank You for this meal

290
00:15:01,664 --> 00:15:03,266
and all of Your bounty.

291
00:15:04,357 --> 00:15:05,845
And we pray that You help Sheldon

292
00:15:06,014 --> 00:15:07,589
get back on his rocker.

293
00:15:08,725 --> 00:15:11,023
Now, after a moment
of silent meditation,

294
00:15:11,143 --> 00:15:13,194
I'm gonna end with
"In Jesus' name,"

295
00:15:13,368 --> 00:15:15,613
but you two don't feel
any obligation to join in.

296
00:15:17,431 --> 00:15:19,791
Unless, of course,
the Holy Spirit moves you.

297
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:32,367
Oh, my God, this is the
best cobbler I've ever had.

298
00:15:32,563 --> 00:15:34,157
It was always Sheldon's favorite.

299
00:15:34,277 --> 00:15:36,260
You know what
the secret ingredient is?

300
00:15:36,730 --> 00:15:38,055
- Love?
- Lard.

301
00:15:43,486 --> 00:15:44,769
Hey, look who's come...

302
00:15:45,233 --> 00:15:46,468
You'll spook him.

303
00:15:48,753 --> 00:15:51,375
He's like a baby deer.
You got to let him come to you.

304
00:15:59,830 --> 00:16:02,879
This is ridiculous.
Damn it, Sheldon, snap out of it!

305
00:16:03,225 --> 00:16:04,316
You're a physicist--

306
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:07,210
You belong at the university
doing research, not hiding in your room!

307
00:16:14,914 --> 00:16:16,149
You don't hunt, do you?

308
00:16:22,895 --> 00:16:24,767
Good morning, snickerdoodle.

309
00:16:26,242 --> 00:16:27,340
Morning.

310
00:16:27,621 --> 00:16:29,971
Well, that looks awful fancy.
What is that?

311
00:16:31,698 --> 00:16:33,745
It's my idea
of what DNA would look like

312
00:16:33,919 --> 00:16:35,631
in a silicon-based life-form.

313
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:41,001
But intelligently designed
by a creator, right?

314
00:16:43,603 --> 00:16:44,764
What do you want, Mom?

315
00:16:45,273 --> 00:16:49,208
You know how your daddy used to say
that you can only fish for so long

316
00:16:49,445 --> 00:16:51,954
before you got to throw a
stick of dynamite in the water?

317
00:16:53,579 --> 00:16:55,258
Well, I'm done fishing.

318
00:16:57,219 --> 00:16:58,223
You put those on.

319
00:16:58,415 --> 00:16:59,928
- What for?
- Because you're gonna

320
00:17:00,058 --> 00:17:02,094
go down to your office,
you're gonna apologize

321
00:17:02,214 --> 00:17:03,782
to your boss
and get your job back.

322
00:17:04,269 --> 00:17:05,362
No.
I'm sorry,

323
00:17:05,516 --> 00:17:07,373
did I start that sentence
with the words,

324
00:17:07,508 --> 00:17:09,274
"If it please Your Highness"?

325
00:17:11,578 --> 00:17:14,300
I'm not going to apologize--
I didn't say anything that wasn't true.

326
00:17:14,447 --> 00:17:15,806
Now, you listen here.

327
00:17:15,985 --> 00:17:18,516
I have been telling you
since you were four years old,

328
00:17:18,674 --> 00:17:20,561
it's okay to be smarter
than everybody,

329
00:17:20,699 --> 00:17:22,417
but you can't go around
pointing it out.

330
00:17:22,706 --> 00:17:25,257
- Why not?
- Because people don't like it!

331
00:17:26,955 --> 00:17:29,599
Remember all the ass-kickings
you got from the neighbor kids?

332
00:17:32,638 --> 00:17:34,297
Now, let's get crackin'.

333
00:17:34,612 --> 00:17:37,262
Shower, shirt, shoes,
and let's shove off.

334
00:17:40,012 --> 00:17:41,731
There wouldn't have been
any ass-kickings

335
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:43,785
if that stupid death ray
had worked.

336
00:17:48,682 --> 00:17:49,682
Problem solved.

337
00:17:50,835 --> 00:17:52,983
Really? That's impressive.

338
00:17:53,401 --> 00:17:56,160
Leonard, the Lord never gives
us more than we can handle.

339
00:17:56,699 --> 00:17:58,952
Thankfully, He blessed me
with two other children

340
00:17:59,107 --> 00:18:00,333
who are dumb as soup.

341
00:18:06,301 --> 00:18:08,316
Excuse me, Dr. Gablehauser,
are you busy?

342
00:18:08,489 --> 00:18:10,534
- Well, actually...
- Sheldon, he's just doodlin'.

343
00:18:10,689 --> 00:18:11,788
Get in here.

344
00:18:19,118 --> 00:18:21,313
Let's go, baby.
We're losing daylight.

345
00:18:25,881 --> 00:18:26,938
As you know,

346
00:18:27,150 --> 00:18:29,755
several weeks ago
in our first encounter,

347
00:18:30,241 --> 00:18:32,044
we may have gotten off
on the wrong foot

348
00:18:32,199 --> 00:18:33,909
when I called you an idiot.

349
00:18:35,121 --> 00:18:37,616
And I just wanted to say
that I was wrong...

350
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,376
to point it out.

351
00:18:42,651 --> 00:18:44,484
I'm sorry,
we haven't been introduced.

352
00:18:46,881 --> 00:18:47,979
Sheldon's mom.

353
00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:51,403
Now, that's impossible! You must
have had him when you were a teenager.

354
00:18:51,686 --> 00:18:53,933
Oh, aren't you sweet.
His father's dead.

355
00:18:56,992 --> 00:18:58,569
- Recently?
- Long enough.

356
00:18:59,687 --> 00:19:00,746
Please.

357
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,743
Sheldon, shouldn't you be working?

358
00:19:14,969 --> 00:19:16,050
Hey, how did it go?

359
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:18,057
I got my job back.

360
00:19:18,247 --> 00:19:19,694
Really?
What happened?

361
00:19:20,675 --> 00:19:22,125
I'm not quite sure.

362
00:19:23,309 --> 00:19:25,219
It involves a part
of the human experience

363
00:19:25,354 --> 00:19:27,089
that has always eluded me.

364
00:19:28,114 --> 00:19:29,735
That narrows it down.

365
00:19:33,403 --> 00:19:34,860
I'm very proud of you honey.

366
00:19:35,053 --> 00:19:36,872
You showed a lot of courage today.

367
00:19:37,814 --> 00:19:38,854
Thanks, Mom.

368
00:19:45,303 --> 00:19:48,139
Is Dr. Gablehauser going
to be my new daddy?

369
00:19:51,537 --> 00:19:52,577
We'll see.

370
00:19:53,235 --> 00:19:54,275
Sleep tight.
