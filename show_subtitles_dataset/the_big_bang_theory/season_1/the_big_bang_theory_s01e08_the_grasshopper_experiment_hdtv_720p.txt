1
00:00:08,997 --> 00:00:11,023
Damn you, walletnook.com!

2
00:00:12,879 --> 00:00:13,805
Problem?

3
00:00:13,959 --> 00:00:16,226
The online description
was completely misleading.

4
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:18,991
They said:
"8 slots plus removable ID".

5
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:22,175
To any rational person,
that would mean room for nine cards.

6
00:00:22,329 --> 00:00:26,265
But they don't tell you the removable ID
takes up one slot. It's a nightmare.

7
00:00:27,829 --> 00:00:32,030
Do you really need the Honorary Justice
League of American membership card?

8
00:00:33,578 --> 00:00:36,337
It's been in every wallet I've owned
since I was five.

9
00:00:37,312 --> 00:00:38,286
Why?

10
00:00:38,701 --> 00:00:41,402
It says
"Keep this on your person at all times."

11
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:44,547
It's right here
under Batman's signature.

12
00:00:46,698 --> 00:00:49,902
...and this is Leonard
and Sheldon's apartment.

13
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:52,819
Guess whose parents
just got broadband.

14
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:55,167
Leonard, may I present,
live from New Delhi,

15
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:57,019
Dr. and Mrs. V. M. Koothrappali.

16
00:00:57,291 --> 00:00:59,316
<i>Hi!
Tilt up the camera up!</i>

17
00:00:59,514 --> 00:01:01,085
<i>I'm looking at his crotch.</i>

18
00:01:01,295 --> 00:01:02,414
Sorry, Papa.

19
00:01:02,619 --> 00:01:04,023
<i>Oh, that's much better. Hi.</i>

20
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:07,307
And over here is Sheldon.

21
00:01:08,911 --> 00:01:10,114
He lives with Leonard.

22
00:01:10,541 --> 00:01:13,160
<i>That's nice.
Like Haroon and Tanvir.</i>

23
00:01:13,383 --> 00:01:14,841
Not like Haroon and Tanvir.

24
00:01:15,133 --> 00:01:16,395
<i>Such sweet young men.</i>

25
00:01:16,662 --> 00:01:19,864
<i>They just adopted the cutest
little Punjabi baby.</i>

26
00:01:20,265 --> 00:01:22,407
No, we're not like
Haroon and Tanvir.

27
00:01:23,447 --> 00:01:25,390
<i>So, are you boys academics
like our son?</i>

28
00:01:25,633 --> 00:01:26,486
Yes.

29
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:29,299
<i>And your parents are comfortable
with your limited earning potential?</i>

30
00:01:29,474 --> 00:01:30,728
- Oh, yes.
- Not at all.

31
00:01:31,145 --> 00:01:32,581
Papa, please. Don't start.

32
00:01:32,763 --> 00:01:34,970
<i>It was just a question.
He's so sensitive.</i>

33
00:01:35,121 --> 00:01:37,533
That's my life. That's my friends.
Good to see you. Say good-bye.

34
00:01:37,745 --> 00:01:39,713
- Bye.
- <i>Wait! Wait!</i>

35
00:01:41,879 --> 00:01:43,712
<i>Before you go,
we have good news.</i>

36
00:01:43,905 --> 00:01:45,776
<i>Put the computer down
and gather your friends.</i>

37
00:01:50,912 --> 00:01:52,569
- What is it, Papa?
- <i>Friends!</i>

38
00:01:54,183 --> 00:01:55,823
Is it just me,
or does web chatting

39
00:01:55,997 --> 00:01:58,042
with your clothes on
seem a little pointless?

40
00:02:00,233 --> 00:02:01,680
<i>Do you rember Lalita Gupta?</i>

41
00:02:02,069 --> 00:02:05,796
The little fat girl that used to kick me
in the samosas and call me untouchable?

42
00:02:05,989 --> 00:02:08,941
<i>Yes. Well, now she's
a dental student at USC,</i>

43
00:02:09,328 --> 00:02:11,307
<i>so we gave her
your contact information.</i>

44
00:02:11,955 --> 00:02:13,181
Why did you do that?

45
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:15,854
<i>You're 26 years old, Rajesh.
We want grandchildren.</i>

46
00:02:16,067 --> 00:02:19,491
- But, Papa, I'm not supposed...
- <i>Lalita's parents approved the match.</i>

47
00:02:20,118 --> 00:02:22,897
<i>If you decide on a spring wedding,
we can avoid monsoon season.</i>

48
00:02:23,264 --> 00:02:24,595
A spring wedding?!

49
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:26,934
<i>It's up to you, dear.
We don't want to meddle.</i>

50
00:02:27,093 --> 00:02:28,945
If you don't want to meddle,
then why are you?

51
00:02:29,157 --> 00:02:31,723
If I may, your parents probably
don't consider this meddling.

52
00:02:31,896 --> 00:02:33,814
While arranged marriages
are no longer the norm,

53
00:02:33,982 --> 00:02:35,410
Indian parents continue to have

54
00:02:35,564 --> 00:02:37,995
a greater-than-average involvement
in their children's love lives.

55
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:40,566
Why are you telling me
about my own culture?

56
00:02:41,665 --> 00:02:42,900
You seemed confused.

57
00:02:44,816 --> 00:02:47,016
Sorry, but with all due respect,
I really don't want to...

58
00:02:47,198 --> 00:02:48,765
<i>I'm sorry, darling.
We have to go.</i>

59
00:02:49,021 --> 00:02:50,390
Doogie Howser <i>is on.</i>

60
00:02:51,603 --> 00:02:53,609
<i>Grandma!
It's </i>Doogie <i>Time!</i>

61
00:02:54,227 --> 00:02:55,577
<i>- Bye-bye!
- Bye-bye!</i>

62
00:02:59,113 --> 00:03:00,436
I don't believe it.

63
00:03:00,651 --> 00:03:01,651
Neither do I.

64
00:03:01,844 --> 00:03:04,440
Doogie Howser's been off
the air for like 20 years.

65
00:03:05,557 --> 00:03:06,869
Actually,
I read somewhere

66
00:03:07,043 --> 00:03:09,157
that it's one of the most
popular programs in India.

67
00:03:09,311 --> 00:03:11,235
It might speak to a cultural aspiration

68
00:03:11,355 --> 00:03:13,461
to have one's children
enter the medical profession.

69
00:03:13,581 --> 00:03:14,638
I bet you're right.

70
00:03:14,851 --> 00:03:17,186
- I bet they loveScrubs.
- What's not to love?

71
00:03:17,399 --> 00:03:18,555
Excuse me! Hello?

72
00:03:19,202 --> 00:03:22,578
My parents are trying to marry me to
a total stranger. What am I going to do?

73
00:03:23,126 --> 00:03:24,650
I suggest you go through with it.

74
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:25,730
What?!

75
00:03:25,949 --> 00:03:30,153
Romantic love as the basis for marriage
has only existed since the 19th century.

76
00:03:30,484 --> 00:03:32,702
Up until then,
arranged marriages were the norm,

77
00:03:32,875 --> 00:03:34,393
and it served society quite well.

78
00:03:34,625 --> 00:03:36,515
It's the entire premise
of <i>Fiddler on the Roof</i>.

79
00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:39,274
I'm not a big fan of musicals,
but I love that show.

80
00:03:39,603 --> 00:03:42,145
Me too.
Of course, it speaks to me culturally.

81
00:03:42,453 --> 00:03:44,872
Understandable, but there's
a universality to that story

82
00:03:45,065 --> 00:03:46,377
which transcends ethnicity.

83
00:03:46,777 --> 00:03:48,872
Let's not forget it's got
some really catchy tunes.

84
00:03:50,965 --> 00:03:52,633
- I know what I'm going to do.
- What?

85
00:03:52,876 --> 00:03:54,091
Find new friends.

86
00:04:00,309 --> 00:04:01,833
So who wants to rent <i>Fiddler</i>?

87
00:04:02,171 --> 00:04:03,753
No need, we have the special edition.

88
00:04:06,315 --> 00:04:08,525
Maybe we are like Haroon and Tanvir.

89
00:04:32,331 --> 00:04:33,759
Subtitles: swsub.com

90
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:37,417
This is Dr. Sheldon Cooper.

91
00:04:37,728 --> 00:04:40,343
Yeah, I need to cancel
my membership to the planetarium.

92
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:44,767
Well, I'm sorry, too,

93
00:04:44,976 --> 00:04:47,271
but there's just no room
for you in my wallet.

94
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:50,690
I understand,

95
00:04:50,846 --> 00:04:53,393
but it was between you
and the Museum of Natural History,

96
00:04:53,584 --> 00:04:55,629
and frankly,
you don't have dinosaurs.

97
00:04:57,823 --> 00:04:59,154
I'll miss you, too. Bye-bye.

98
00:05:01,053 --> 00:05:04,256
Okay, I know you're texting about me
and I'd really like you to stop.

99
00:05:06,981 --> 00:05:09,373
Oh, dear,
I am rightly and truly screwed.

100
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:12,161
Hey, I thought you were
finding new friends.

101
00:05:12,373 --> 00:05:13,859
I've got some feelers out.

102
00:05:14,733 --> 00:05:16,540
In the meantime, listen to this.

103
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:19,107
Hi, Rajesh.
This is Lalita Gupta.

104
00:05:19,451 --> 00:05:22,539
Your mother gave my mother
your phone number to give to me.

105
00:05:22,731 --> 00:05:23,985
So, I'm calling you

106
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:26,608
and... call me back. Bye.

107
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:31,368
Can you believe how pushy she is?

108
00:05:33,717 --> 00:05:35,066
So don't call her.

109
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:37,745
If I don't call her, I won't hear
the end of it from my parents.

110
00:05:37,917 --> 00:05:39,080
- So call her.
- How?

111
00:05:39,254 --> 00:05:40,701
You know I can't talk to women.

112
00:05:41,638 --> 00:05:42,848
I'm done.
Anybody else?

113
00:05:43,953 --> 00:05:45,284
- Give me the phone.
- Why?

114
00:05:45,612 --> 00:05:46,707
Just give it to me.

115
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,967
- What are you doing?
- Don't worry. You'll thank me.

116
00:05:51,216 --> 00:05:53,425
Hello, Lalita?
Raj Koothrappali here.

117
00:05:56,833 --> 00:05:58,994
Yes, it is good
to talk to you, too.

118
00:06:01,592 --> 00:06:03,290
So what are you wearing?

119
00:06:06,533 --> 00:06:07,787
Oh, not important.

120
00:06:08,081 --> 00:06:10,608
So, anyhow,
when would you like to meet?

121
00:06:12,021 --> 00:06:13,546
Friday works for me!

122
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:17,304
I'll call you with a time and place.

123
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:20,376
But in the meantime,
keep it real, babe.

124
00:06:27,067 --> 00:06:28,468
You may now thank me.

125
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:32,415
For what? Making me sound
like a <i>Simpsons</i> character?

126
00:06:33,591 --> 00:06:35,110
Next time make your own date.

127
00:06:35,308 --> 00:06:37,528
- I didn't want this one!
- Look on the bright side,

128
00:06:37,701 --> 00:06:39,880
she might turn out to be
a nice, beautiful girl.

129
00:06:40,151 --> 00:06:42,544
Great, then we'll get married,
I won't be able to talk to her

130
00:06:42,775 --> 00:06:45,399
and we'll spend the rest
of our lives in total silence.

131
00:06:45,987 --> 00:06:47,589
It worked for my parents.

132
00:06:49,429 --> 00:06:50,371
Hi, guys.

133
00:06:50,737 --> 00:06:52,111
I need some guinea pigs.

134
00:06:52,536 --> 00:06:56,284
There's a lab animal supply company
in Reseda you could try.

135
00:06:56,651 --> 00:06:58,837
But if your research is going
to have human applications,

136
00:06:59,011 --> 00:07:00,458
may I suggest white mice instead?

137
00:07:00,612 --> 00:07:03,178
Their brain chemistry
is far closer to ours.

138
00:07:04,977 --> 00:07:06,435
I swear to God, one day,

139
00:07:06,647 --> 00:07:08,885
I'm going to get the hang
of talking to you.

140
00:07:09,552 --> 00:07:11,644
His mom's been saying that for years.

141
00:07:14,362 --> 00:07:15,310
What's up?

142
00:07:15,638 --> 00:07:18,127
I finally convinced the restaurant
to give me a bartending shift,

143
00:07:18,293 --> 00:07:19,933
so I need to practice mixing drinks.

144
00:07:20,175 --> 00:07:22,466
Great.
The key to acquiring proficiency

145
00:07:22,659 --> 00:07:24,241
in any task is repetition.

146
00:07:24,570 --> 00:07:26,114
With certain obvious exceptions.

147
00:07:27,585 --> 00:07:29,121
Suicide, for example.

148
00:07:31,488 --> 00:07:32,944
So, Leonard, how about it?

149
00:07:34,962 --> 00:07:38,601
We'd love to help you, but Raj
is going through some stuff right now,

150
00:07:38,888 --> 00:07:40,488
besides, he doesn't drink, so...

151
00:07:43,106 --> 00:07:44,106
Really?

152
00:07:46,843 --> 00:07:48,866
Raj is going through
some stuff right now

153
00:07:49,078 --> 00:07:50,968
and he'd like to take up drinking.

154
00:07:54,071 --> 00:07:56,522
Here you go, Leonard.
One Tequila Sunrise.

155
00:07:56,735 --> 00:07:57,735
Thank you.

156
00:07:58,218 --> 00:07:59,777
This drink is a wonderful example

157
00:08:00,045 --> 00:08:02,131
of how liquids with different
specific gravities

158
00:08:02,324 --> 00:08:04,195
interact in a cylindrical container.

159
00:08:06,297 --> 00:08:07,297
Thank you.

160
00:08:08,645 --> 00:08:09,861
Okay, Raj, what'll it be?

161
00:08:12,769 --> 00:08:13,959
Whatever you recommend.

162
00:08:14,326 --> 00:08:16,655
How about a Grasshopper?
I make a mean Grasshopper.

163
00:08:17,623 --> 00:08:18,761
Okay? Good. Coming up.

164
00:08:19,018 --> 00:08:20,651
Sheldon, what are you going to have?

165
00:08:20,823 --> 00:08:22,466
I'll have a Diet Coke.

166
00:08:24,064 --> 00:08:27,339
Can you please order a cocktail?
I need to practice mixing drinks.

167
00:08:27,597 --> 00:08:30,144
Fine.
I'll have a Virgin Cuba Libre.

168
00:08:32,838 --> 00:08:35,074
That's, rum and Coke
without the rum.

169
00:08:35,436 --> 00:08:36,420
Yes.

170
00:08:38,144 --> 00:08:39,144
So... Coke.

171
00:08:39,493 --> 00:08:40,399
Yes.

172
00:08:41,864 --> 00:08:43,407
And would you make it diet?

173
00:08:48,666 --> 00:08:49,978
There's a can in the fridge.

174
00:08:50,812 --> 00:08:54,407
A Cuba Libre traditionally comes
in a tall glass with a lime wedge.

175
00:08:54,973 --> 00:08:56,400
Then swim to Cuba.

176
00:08:59,079 --> 00:09:01,157
Bartenders are supposed
to have people skills.

177
00:09:04,486 --> 00:09:05,779
Raj, here you go.

178
00:09:06,301 --> 00:09:07,575
All right.
Who's next?

179
00:09:07,854 --> 00:09:10,034
I'd like to try
a Slippery Nipple.

180
00:09:15,054 --> 00:09:16,288
Okay, you're cut off.

181
00:09:19,067 --> 00:09:20,224
Anybody need a refill?

182
00:09:20,894 --> 00:09:22,244
Where did my life go, Penny?

183
00:09:25,236 --> 00:09:27,617
One day I'm a carefree bachelor,
and the next I'm married

184
00:09:27,810 --> 00:09:29,787
and driving a minivan
to peewee cricket matches

185
00:09:29,961 --> 00:09:31,601
in suburban New Delhi.

186
00:09:34,076 --> 00:09:35,292
Are you talking to me?

187
00:09:35,808 --> 00:09:37,399
Is the another Penny here?

188
00:09:39,162 --> 00:09:41,559
I had such plans.
I had dreams.

189
00:09:41,932 --> 00:09:45,207
I was going to be the Indira Gandhi
of particle astrophysics.

190
00:09:45,517 --> 00:09:47,314
But with a penis, of course.

191
00:09:49,738 --> 00:09:52,016
- Amazing.
- Ever since I was a little boy,

192
00:09:52,245 --> 00:09:54,309
my father wanted me to be
a gynecologist like him.

193
00:09:55,515 --> 00:09:59,026
How can I be a gynecologist?
I can barely look a woman in the eye!

194
00:10:02,848 --> 00:10:03,784
You know what?

195
00:10:03,968 --> 00:10:06,343
I'm not going to let my parents
control my future any longer.

196
00:10:06,532 --> 00:10:07,959
It's time for a showdown.

197
00:10:08,208 --> 00:10:10,418
Somebody give me a computer
with a webcam!

198
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:14,379
Sweetie, I think
that's the Grasshopper talking.

199
00:10:14,707 --> 00:10:16,213
And it's about to tell my parents

200
00:10:16,386 --> 00:10:19,666
that I'm not riding an elephant
down the aisle with Lalita Gupta.

201
00:10:19,976 --> 00:10:21,267
Okay, calm down.

202
00:10:22,029 --> 00:10:23,881
No one can make you get married.

203
00:10:24,498 --> 00:10:26,642
Why don't you just meet this girl
and see what happens?

204
00:10:26,826 --> 00:10:29,362
Haven't you been listening to me?
I cannot talk to women.

205
00:10:30,605 --> 00:10:32,669
No, no, let's see
how long it takes him.

206
00:10:34,202 --> 00:10:35,321
Raj, honey,

207
00:10:35,767 --> 00:10:39,082
you say you can't talk to women,
but you've been talking to me.

208
00:10:39,327 --> 00:10:40,756
And now we'll never know.

209
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:43,475
You're right.

210
00:10:45,071 --> 00:10:46,441
I am talking to you.

211
00:10:47,271 --> 00:10:48,795
Hello, Penny, how are you?

212
00:10:50,563 --> 00:10:52,769
- I'm fine.
- Okay, now I just need

213
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:55,904
to make sure I have a Lalita
before I meet the Grasshopper.

214
00:10:59,207 --> 00:11:01,583
It's a sweet, green miracle.

215
00:11:02,364 --> 00:11:05,754
If you're going to drink on this date,
just promise me you won't overdo it.

216
00:11:06,210 --> 00:11:07,210
Overdo what?

217
00:11:07,669 --> 00:11:08,669
Happiness?

218
00:11:09,969 --> 00:11:10,969
Freedom?

219
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:13,281
This warm glow inside of me

220
00:11:13,474 --> 00:11:16,338
that promises everything's
going to be all hunky-dunky?

221
00:11:17,386 --> 00:11:19,917
Yeah, that.
Why don't you bring her to my restaurant

222
00:11:20,090 --> 00:11:22,271
while I'm tending the bar
so I can keep an eye on you.

223
00:11:24,796 --> 00:11:26,100
What's the plan here?

224
00:11:26,251 --> 00:11:28,396
Let's say he meets her,
he likes her, they get married.

225
00:11:28,531 --> 00:11:31,115
What's he going to do,
stay drunk for the rest of his life?

226
00:11:31,309 --> 00:11:32,774
Worked for my parents.

227
00:11:43,474 --> 00:11:46,889
I can't believe I'm sitting here
next to little Lalita Gupta.

228
00:11:48,226 --> 00:11:49,384
Well, you are.

229
00:11:50,104 --> 00:11:51,299
Little Lalita.

230
00:11:52,206 --> 00:11:53,739
That's kind of fun to say.

231
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,200
Little Lalita, little
Lalita, little Lalita.

232
00:11:57,357 --> 00:11:59,036
- You should try it.
- Oh, it's okay.

233
00:12:02,519 --> 00:12:04,120
You have lost so much weight.

234
00:12:05,501 --> 00:12:08,819
That must have been difficult for you
because you were so, so fat.

235
00:12:10,718 --> 00:12:11,721
Do you remember?

236
00:12:12,482 --> 00:12:13,556
Yes, I do.

237
00:12:13,842 --> 00:12:16,585
Of course you do.
Who could forget being that fat?

238
00:12:18,589 --> 00:12:19,696
I've been trying.

239
00:12:21,113 --> 00:12:22,714
So you're a dental student.

240
00:12:24,955 --> 00:12:28,188
Are you aware that dentists
have an extremely high suicide rate?

241
00:12:29,398 --> 00:12:31,483
Not as high as, say,
air traffic controllers,

242
00:12:31,603 --> 00:12:33,963
but there are far more dentists
than air traffic controllers,

243
00:12:34,124 --> 00:12:35,938
so in pure numbers,
you're still winning.

244
00:12:36,803 --> 00:12:37,803
Yay, me.

245
00:12:39,608 --> 00:12:42,094
Do you have a drink that will
make him less obnoxious?

246
00:12:42,541 --> 00:12:44,208
Drinks do not work that way.

247
00:12:45,679 --> 00:12:47,272
I'd say he's doing fine.
Look at her.

248
00:12:47,502 --> 00:12:50,878
The last girl my mom set me up with
had a mustache and a vestigial tail.

249
00:12:53,639 --> 00:12:55,183
- Sorry I'm late.
- What happened?

250
00:12:55,550 --> 00:12:57,597
Nothing.
I just really didn't want to come.

251
00:12:59,747 --> 00:13:02,255
Virgin diet Cuba Libre, please.

252
00:13:03,964 --> 00:13:06,337
In a tall glass
with a lime wedge.

253
00:13:07,558 --> 00:13:09,294
Oh, I'll wedge it right in there.

254
00:13:11,815 --> 00:13:13,078
So how's Koothrappali...

255
00:13:13,494 --> 00:13:14,787
Oh, my Lord.

256
00:13:15,075 --> 00:13:17,251
- What?
- That's Princess Panchali.

257
00:13:18,198 --> 00:13:19,789
I'm pretty sure her name's Lalita.

258
00:13:20,004 --> 00:13:23,505
No, no, Princess Panchali,
fromThe Monkey and the Princess.

259
00:13:24,552 --> 00:13:27,910
Oh, yeah. I tried to watch that online,
but they wanted my credit card.

260
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:31,423
It's a children's story.

261
00:13:31,670 --> 00:13:32,905
Oh, no, it isn't.

262
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:39,567
When I was a little boy and got sick,
which was most of the time,

263
00:13:39,752 --> 00:13:41,167
my mother would read it to me.

264
00:13:41,352 --> 00:13:44,342
It's about an Indian princess
who befriends a monkey

265
00:13:44,632 --> 00:13:47,653
who was mocked by all the other monkeys
because he was different.

266
00:13:47,891 --> 00:13:50,312
For some reason,
I related to it quite strongly.

267
00:13:51,346 --> 00:13:52,696
I know the reason.

268
00:13:53,894 --> 00:13:55,329
We all know the reason.

269
00:13:57,220 --> 00:13:58,705
Sheldon, what are you getting at?

270
00:13:58,926 --> 00:14:00,942
That woman looks
exactly like the pictures

271
00:14:01,096 --> 00:14:02,707
of Princess Panchali in the book.

272
00:14:03,184 --> 00:14:06,641
How often does one see a beloved
fictional character come to life?

273
00:14:07,122 --> 00:14:08,795
Every year at Comic-Con.

274
00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:11,445
Every day at Disneyland.

275
00:14:11,599 --> 00:14:14,013
You can hire Snow White
to come to your house.

276
00:14:14,311 --> 00:14:16,549
Of course, they prefer it
if you have a kid.

277
00:14:17,781 --> 00:14:19,573
Hey, guys.
This is Lalita Gupta.

278
00:14:19,785 --> 00:14:20,982
Lalita, this is Leonard

279
00:14:21,185 --> 00:14:23,134
and Sheldon
and Howard and Penny.

280
00:14:23,497 --> 00:14:25,465
Isn't it great?
She isn't fat anymore.

281
00:14:26,905 --> 00:14:29,343
"Forgive me, Your Highness,
for I am but a monkey,

282
00:14:29,529 --> 00:14:31,073
"and it is in my nature to climb.

283
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:32,708
"I did not mean to gaze upon you

284
00:14:32,881 --> 00:14:34,420
as you comb your hair."

285
00:14:36,155 --> 00:14:37,236
I'm sorry?

286
00:14:37,633 --> 00:14:40,642
You are the living embodiment
of the beautiful Princess Panchali.

287
00:14:41,273 --> 00:14:42,603
Oh, no kidding.

288
00:14:43,262 --> 00:14:44,265
Who is that?

289
00:14:44,632 --> 00:14:46,966
A beloved character
from an Indian folktale.

290
00:14:49,143 --> 00:14:51,516
Us Indian or
"Come to our casino" Indian?

291
00:14:53,879 --> 00:14:54,766
You Indian.

292
00:14:56,011 --> 00:14:57,765
The resemblance is remarkable.

293
00:14:58,156 --> 00:15:00,028
I can practically smell
the lotus blossoms

294
00:15:00,221 --> 00:15:01,630
woven into your ebony hair.

295
00:15:01,868 --> 00:15:03,063
Well, thanks.

296
00:15:03,864 --> 00:15:05,827
I imagine you smell very nice, too.

297
00:15:06,521 --> 00:15:09,777
I shower twice a day and wash
my hands as often as I can.

298
00:15:10,728 --> 00:15:12,405
Really? So do I.

299
00:15:12,648 --> 00:15:14,674
But you're a dentist.
He's nuts.

300
00:15:16,723 --> 00:15:18,228
Don't be insulting, Rajesh.

301
00:15:18,926 --> 00:15:19,832
So, Sheldon,

302
00:15:20,391 --> 00:15:22,780
tell me more about this princess
you say I look like.

303
00:15:23,205 --> 00:15:26,913
It was said that the gods
fashioned her eyes out of the stars

304
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:31,208
and that roses were ashamed to bloom
in the presence of her ruby lips.

305
00:15:32,108 --> 00:15:34,202
- Oh, my.
- Back off, Sheldon.

306
00:15:34,794 --> 00:15:35,643
What?

307
00:15:35,827 --> 00:15:38,694
If you do not stop hitting on my lady,
you'll feel the full extent of my wrath.

308
00:15:40,583 --> 00:15:41,798
I'm not hitting on her.

309
00:15:42,223 --> 00:15:43,561
And I am not your lady.

310
00:15:43,744 --> 00:15:45,379
And you have no wrath.

311
00:15:47,725 --> 00:15:49,827
You are my lady.
Our parents said so.

312
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:52,452
We are, for all intents
and purposes, 100% hooked up.

313
00:15:52,974 --> 00:15:54,499
Let's get something straight here.

314
00:15:54,692 --> 00:15:57,483
The only reason I came tonight
was to get my parents off my case.

315
00:15:57,689 --> 00:16:00,338
I certainly don't need to be getting
this Old World crap from you.

316
00:16:00,517 --> 00:16:02,050
That's exactly the kind of spirit

317
00:16:02,242 --> 00:16:04,752
with which Princess Panchali
led the monkeys to freedom.

318
00:16:04,968 --> 00:16:07,234
- Screw Princess Panchali.
- You can't talk to me like that.

319
00:16:07,388 --> 00:16:08,931
But you're not Princess Panchali.

320
00:16:09,123 --> 00:16:11,383
Luckily for you--
she could have you beheaded.

321
00:16:12,312 --> 00:16:13,546
Sheldon, are you hungry?

322
00:16:13,714 --> 00:16:15,703
- I could eat.
- Let's go.

323
00:16:19,993 --> 00:16:21,093
What just happened?

324
00:16:21,335 --> 00:16:22,984
Beats the hell out of me.

325
00:16:23,151 --> 00:16:26,445
I'll tell you what happened. I just
learned how to pick up Indian chicks.

326
00:16:29,594 --> 00:16:31,745
<i>What are we supposed to say
to Lalita's parents?</i>

327
00:16:32,068 --> 00:16:34,700
<i>I play golf with her father.
I won't be able to look at him.</i>

328
00:16:34,866 --> 00:16:37,385
Maybe you should keep your eye
on the ball, Papa.

329
00:16:37,970 --> 00:16:39,261
<i>Oh, now you're a funny man.</i>

330
00:16:39,381 --> 00:16:41,280
<i>This is not funny, Mr. Funny Man.</i>

331
00:16:42,255 --> 00:16:43,591
Dr. and Mrs. Koothrappali,

332
00:16:43,803 --> 00:16:46,292
in all fairness,
it wasn't entirely Raj's fault.

333
00:16:46,671 --> 00:16:48,137
<i>This is a family matter, Sheldon.</i>

334
00:16:48,291 --> 00:16:49,275
I'm Leonard.

335
00:16:50,172 --> 00:16:52,062
Sorry.
You all look alike to us.

336
00:16:53,998 --> 00:16:56,122
But he's right, Papa.
Listen to him.

337
00:16:56,839 --> 00:16:59,109
You! You are the one
who ruined everything.

338
00:16:59,452 --> 00:17:00,874
<i>Who is it?
We can't see.</i>

339
00:17:01,153 --> 00:17:02,445
<i>Turn us.
Turn us!</i>

340
00:17:05,825 --> 00:17:08,584
Go ahead, tell my parents
why they won't have any grandchildren.

341
00:17:09,114 --> 00:17:11,641
How would I know?
Do you have a low sperm count?

342
00:17:13,723 --> 00:17:15,779
This has nothing to do
with my sperm count.

343
00:17:16,018 --> 00:17:18,697
<i>You are wearing the boxers
that we sent you, aren't you?</i>

344
00:17:18,890 --> 00:17:20,861
- Yes, Mumi.
- <i>Because you know what happens</i>

345
00:17:21,034 --> 00:17:23,311
<i>to the samosas
when you wear tighty-whities.</i>

346
00:17:24,636 --> 00:17:26,753
Can we please stop talking
about my testicles?

347
00:17:27,321 --> 00:17:28,768
Sheldon, tell them what you did.

348
00:17:29,050 --> 00:17:30,043
What did I do?

349
00:17:30,594 --> 00:17:31,874
You left with his date.

350
00:17:32,405 --> 00:17:34,239
Friends don't do that to each other.

351
00:17:36,512 --> 00:17:37,707
All right, noted.

352
00:17:39,970 --> 00:17:40,970
Sorry.

353
00:17:41,224 --> 00:17:42,913
Sorry?
That's all you can say is sorry?

354
00:17:43,153 --> 00:17:45,395
Take it.
It's more than I've ever gotten.

355
00:17:45,627 --> 00:17:46,616
May I point out,

356
00:17:46,774 --> 00:17:49,773
she wouldn't have asked me to go with
her if you hadn't been drunk and boring.

357
00:17:49,992 --> 00:17:52,311
- <i>Drunk?</i>
- And boring-- her words.

358
00:17:53,437 --> 00:17:56,147
<i>I knew it. He moves to America
and he becomes an alcoholic.</i>

359
00:17:56,364 --> 00:17:57,735
I'm not an alcoholic.

360
00:17:58,024 --> 00:17:59,374
<i>Then why were you drunk?</i>

361
00:17:59,952 --> 00:18:02,778
- It was just this one time, I swear.
- <i>Are you in denial?</i>

362
00:18:02,947 --> 00:18:04,969
<i>Do we have to come over
and do an intervention?</i>

363
00:18:05,137 --> 00:18:07,476
<i>Don't embarrass him
in front of his friends.</i>

364
00:18:07,886 --> 00:18:09,722
<i>All right.
Carry us outside.</i>

365
00:18:09,933 --> 00:18:11,722
<i>We want to talk to you in private.</i>

366
00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:14,149
- But, Papa, please...
- <i>Now, Rajesh!</i>

367
00:18:18,701 --> 00:18:19,760
I have to go.

368
00:18:22,232 --> 00:18:23,332
Now, listen to me...

369
00:18:23,545 --> 00:18:25,354
At least wait till I get into the hall.

370
00:18:29,088 --> 00:18:30,298
Okay, well, good night.

371
00:18:30,959 --> 00:18:31,905
Hold on.

372
00:18:33,105 --> 00:18:34,772
What happened
with you and Lalita?

373
00:18:35,643 --> 00:18:37,634
We ate,
she lectured me

374
00:18:37,844 --> 00:18:39,850
on the link between gum disease
and heart attacks--

375
00:18:40,043 --> 00:18:42,204
nothing I didn't already know--
and I came home.

376
00:18:42,971 --> 00:18:44,573
So you're not going
to see her again?

377
00:18:45,343 --> 00:18:46,828
Why would I see her again?

378
00:18:47,189 --> 00:18:48,752
I already have a dentist.

379
00:18:54,426 --> 00:18:57,864
I wonder who's going to tell his parents
they're not having grandchildren?

380
00:19:19,522 --> 00:19:21,297
I don't believe it.
What's gotten into him?

381
00:19:21,814 --> 00:19:24,268
Oh, maybe a couple
virgin Cuba Libres

382
00:19:24,481 --> 00:19:26,776
that turned out
to be kind of slutty.

383
00:19:28,271 --> 00:19:29,293
You didn't.

384
00:19:29,533 --> 00:19:31,694
You do your experiments.
I do mine.
