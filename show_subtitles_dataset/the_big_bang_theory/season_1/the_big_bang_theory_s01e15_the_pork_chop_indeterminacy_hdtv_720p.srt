1
00:00:00,414 --> 00:00:02,550
On the other hand,
some physicists are concerned

2
00:00:02,670 --> 00:00:04,644
that if this supercollider
actually works,

3
00:00:04,764 --> 00:00:06,857
it'll create a black hole
and swallow up the Earth,

4
00:00:06,977 --> 00:00:08,670
ending life as we know it.

5
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:10,571
What a bunch of crybabies.

6
00:00:11,066 --> 00:00:12,766
No guts, no glory, man.

7
00:00:13,832 --> 00:00:15,197
Hey, check it out.

8
00:00:15,496 --> 00:00:18,477
The School of Pharmacology
is looking for volunteers.

9
00:00:18,597 --> 00:00:21,066
"We are testing a new medication
for social anxiety,

10
00:00:21,226 --> 00:00:25,110
"panic attacks, agoraphobia
and obsessive compulsive disorder."

11
00:00:26,879 --> 00:00:29,116
Why would they be looking
for test subjects here?

12
00:00:30,468 --> 00:00:31,795
I don't know, Raj.

13
00:00:31,915 --> 00:00:34,669
Maybe the comic book store
doesn't have a bulletin board.

14
00:00:38,307 --> 00:00:40,585
- What's going on?
- Hot girl in Sheldon's office.

15
00:00:41,872 --> 00:00:42,963
Sheldon's office?

16
00:00:45,223 --> 00:00:46,382
Is she lost?

17
00:00:47,634 --> 00:00:48,699
I don't think so.

18
00:00:48,819 --> 00:00:50,929
I followed her here
from the parking lot.

19
00:00:52,924 --> 00:00:54,457
Maybe she's his lawyer.

20
00:00:54,765 --> 00:00:56,952
Well, she's free to examine my briefs.

21
00:00:57,644 --> 00:01:00,522
I know, I'm disgusting.
I should be punished... by her.

22
00:01:00,683 --> 00:01:02,063
Look, I did it again.

23
00:01:03,051 --> 00:01:04,266
That should do it.

24
00:01:04,386 --> 00:01:05,933
Thank you for coming by.

25
00:01:12,521 --> 00:01:13,419
Hello.

26
00:01:15,025 --> 00:01:16,390
Hey, buddy...

27
00:01:18,649 --> 00:01:20,013
"Buddy..."?

28
00:01:20,911 --> 00:01:23,670
Sorry I'm late.
I'm working on a project

29
00:01:23,831 --> 00:01:26,406
that may take me up
on the next space shuttle.

30
00:01:26,985 --> 00:01:29,676
How can you be late?
I wasn't expecting you at all.

31
00:01:30,529 --> 00:01:33,263
Nobody ever expects me.
Sometimes you just look and...

32
00:01:33,424 --> 00:01:34,941
Bam! Howard Wolowitz.

33
00:01:37,135 --> 00:01:38,518
Are you gonna introduce us?

34
00:01:39,071 --> 00:01:40,603
All right. This is Missy.

35
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:44,524
Missy, this is Leonard and Rajesh,
and you've already met Howard.

36
00:01:44,685 --> 00:01:47,510
- It's nice to meet you.
- You, too, as well, also.

37
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:52,032
So, how do you two know each other?

38
00:01:52,877 --> 00:01:56,260
He once spent nine months
with my legs wrapped around his head.

39
00:01:59,771 --> 00:02:00,761
Excuse me?

40
00:02:01,891 --> 00:02:04,330
She's my twin sister.
She thinks she's funny,

41
00:02:04,450 --> 00:02:06,618
but frankly,
I've never been able to see it.

42
00:02:06,738 --> 00:02:09,424
That's because you have
no measurable sense of humor, Shelly.

43
00:02:09,751 --> 00:02:12,349
How exactly would one
measure a sense of humor?

44
00:02:12,676 --> 00:02:14,134
A humormometer?

45
00:02:17,175 --> 00:02:19,295
I think you're delightfully droll.

46
00:02:19,415 --> 00:02:21,893
Or, as the French say,
<i>très drôle</i>.

47
00:02:22,566 --> 00:02:24,064
So let me see if I got this.

48
00:02:24,578 --> 00:02:27,067
Leonard, Howard and...

49
00:02:27,228 --> 00:02:29,269
I'm sorry, what was your name again?

50
00:02:56,184 --> 00:02:57,063
Rajesh.

51
00:02:58,502 --> 00:03:00,969
Episode 115:
The Shiksa Indeterminacy

52
00:03:01,636 --> 00:03:04,688
Transcript: swsub.com
Synch: sub-way.fr | italiansubs.net

53
00:03:22,427 --> 00:03:24,614
So Missy, what brings you
all the way from Texas?

54
00:03:24,734 --> 00:03:26,977
Was it perhaps destiny?
I think it was destiny.

55
00:03:27,396 --> 00:03:29,712
My friend's getting married
at Disneyland tomorrow night.

56
00:03:29,873 --> 00:03:32,147
Destiny, thy name is Anaheim.

57
00:03:34,756 --> 00:03:38,012
And I had to drop off some papers
for Shelly to sign for my Dad's estate.

58
00:03:38,173 --> 00:03:41,682
The papers could've been mailed.
Mom sent you to spy on me, didn't she?

59
00:03:41,843 --> 00:03:44,143
I guess that's why
they call you a genius.

60
00:03:44,304 --> 00:03:46,696
They call me a genius
because I'm a genius.

61
00:03:47,874 --> 00:03:50,483
{\pos(192,200)}Tell Mom
that I currently weigh 165 pounds

62
00:03:50,685 --> 00:03:52,898
and that I'm having
regular bowel movements.

63
00:03:54,179 --> 00:03:55,696
Enjoy the wedding. Good-bye.

64
00:03:58,833 --> 00:04:02,328
If the wedding's not until tomorrow,
why don't you stay with us tonight?

65
00:04:02,489 --> 00:04:05,039
I don't think so.
Shelly doesn't like company.

66
00:04:05,201 --> 00:04:07,623
Even as a little boy,
he'd send his imaginary friends home

67
00:04:07,743 --> 00:04:09,001
at the end of the day.

68
00:04:09,475 --> 00:04:12,588
They were not friends.
They were imaginary colleagues.

69
00:04:13,508 --> 00:04:15,977
Look, you're here.
We have plenty of room.

70
00:04:16,097 --> 00:04:17,092
No, we don't.

71
00:04:17,255 --> 00:04:19,582
Come on, Shelly.
She's family.

72
00:04:20,126 --> 00:04:22,874
So what, I don't issue invitations
to your mother.

73
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:26,727
It would be nice not to have
to drive to Anaheim in rush hour.

74
00:04:26,888 --> 00:04:28,658
And don't ever call me Shelly.

75
00:04:29,556 --> 00:04:31,357
So it's settled: you'll stay with us.

76
00:04:31,518 --> 00:04:34,679
Yeah, I'll walk you to your car.
You're in structure 3, level C, right?

77
00:04:38,831 --> 00:04:40,382
What just happened?

78
00:04:42,572 --> 00:04:44,438
So anyway, we're eight years old

79
00:04:44,558 --> 00:04:46,644
and Sheldon converts
my Easy Bake Oven

80
00:04:46,764 --> 00:04:48,749
to some kind
of high-powered furnace.

81
00:04:49,625 --> 00:04:50,896
Just classic.

82
00:04:52,428 --> 00:04:55,262
I needed a place to fire
ceramic semiconductor substrates

83
00:04:55,382 --> 00:04:57,174
for homemade integrated circuits.

84
00:04:57,402 --> 00:04:59,477
He was trying to build
some sort of armed robot

85
00:04:59,597 --> 00:05:01,010
to keep me out of his room.

86
00:05:01,327 --> 00:05:04,360
Made necessary by her insistence
on going into my room.

87
00:05:05,052 --> 00:05:07,582
Anyway, I go to make
those little corn muffins they give you.

88
00:05:07,702 --> 00:05:11,016
There's a big flash. Next thing you know
my eyebrows are gone.

89
00:05:12,437 --> 00:05:13,876
Not your eyebrows!

90
00:05:15,188 --> 00:05:17,600
Yep, I had to go through
the entire second grade

91
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:20,114
with crooked eyebrows
my mom drew on.

92
00:05:20,478 --> 00:05:21,880
Is that what that was?

93
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,995
I just assumed that the second grade
curriculum had rendered you quizzical.

94
00:05:29,283 --> 00:05:32,081
You left your underwear
in the dryer downstairs.

95
00:05:38,306 --> 00:05:39,633
Those are not mine.

96
00:05:41,222 --> 00:05:44,329
Really? They have
your little name label in them.

97
00:05:45,525 --> 00:05:47,801
Yeah, no, I do... I use those...

98
00:05:48,178 --> 00:05:51,655
just to polish up
my spearfishing equipment.

99
00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:54,967
I spearfish.

100
00:05:59,099 --> 00:06:01,655
When I'm not crossbow hunting,
I spearfish.

101
00:06:04,953 --> 00:06:07,036
This is Sheldon's twin sister, Missy.

102
00:06:07,196 --> 00:06:08,746
This is our neighbor, Penny.

103
00:06:08,907 --> 00:06:12,152
- You don't look that much alike.
- Can I get a hallelujah?

104
00:06:13,501 --> 00:06:15,588
Fraternal twins come
from two separate eggs.

105
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:17,795
They are no more alike
than any other siblings.

106
00:06:20,626 --> 00:06:22,467
Hey, guess what.
I've been accepted

107
00:06:22,587 --> 00:06:26,387
as a test subject for a new miracle drug
to overcome pathological shyness.

108
00:06:27,174 --> 00:06:30,518
- Good for you, Raj.
- Yes, I'm very hopeful. Hello, Missy.

109
00:06:41,138 --> 00:06:43,531
They mentioned
there may be side effects.

110
00:06:45,655 --> 00:06:46,732
So, Missy,

111
00:06:47,521 --> 00:06:50,963
have you ever met a man
from the exotic subcontinent of India?

112
00:06:52,451 --> 00:06:54,792
Well, there's Dr. Patel at our church.

113
00:06:54,953 --> 00:06:56,710
Yes, Patel... good man.

114
00:06:57,163 --> 00:06:59,964
Do you like motorcycles?
'Cause I ride a hog.

115
00:07:00,805 --> 00:07:04,009
A hog? You have a two-cylinder scooter
with a basket in the front.

116
00:07:05,893 --> 00:07:08,179
You still have to wear a helmet.

117
00:07:09,893 --> 00:07:12,029
Have you ever heard
of the Kama Sutra?

118
00:07:12,149 --> 00:07:14,664
- The sex book.
- The Indian sex book.

119
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:16,966
In other words,
if you "wonder, wonder

120
00:07:17,086 --> 00:07:19,751
who wrote the book of love,"
it was us.

121
00:07:21,989 --> 00:07:25,192
- Sheldon's sister is pretty cute, huh?
- I wasn't staring.

122
00:07:27,239 --> 00:07:30,007
I didn't say you were.
I just said she was cute.

123
00:07:32,078 --> 00:07:33,039
Maybe,

124
00:07:33,577 --> 00:07:35,791
if you like women who are tall...

125
00:07:37,010 --> 00:07:38,211
and perfect.

126
00:07:41,235 --> 00:07:43,369
Sheldon, why are you
ignoring your sister?

127
00:07:43,489 --> 00:07:46,544
I'm not ignoring my sister.
I'm ignoring all of you.

128
00:07:47,925 --> 00:07:49,180
I brought snacks!

129
00:07:49,585 --> 00:07:52,576
Oh, my, gherkins and...

130
00:07:53,457 --> 00:07:55,338
Onion dip. It's onion dip.

131
00:07:58,072 --> 00:07:59,643
We don't entertain much.

132
00:08:01,959 --> 00:08:04,253
Missy.
Do you enjoy pajamas?

133
00:08:05,487 --> 00:08:07,891
- I guess.
- We Indians invented them.

134
00:08:09,104 --> 00:08:10,342
You're welcome.

135
00:08:11,977 --> 00:08:14,504
Yeah, well, my people
invented circumcision.

136
00:08:19,424 --> 00:08:20,786
You're welcome.

137
00:08:22,517 --> 00:08:25,090
Missy, I'm gonna go get my nails done.
Do you want to come?

138
00:08:25,293 --> 00:08:27,501
God, yes.
Thanks.

139
00:08:27,982 --> 00:08:29,173
You're welcome.

140
00:08:30,372 --> 00:08:32,856
- Bye, guys.
- Bye, Missy, see you.

141
00:08:33,348 --> 00:08:36,015
- Goodbye, Leonard.
- Oh, yeah, no, bye, Penny.

142
00:08:38,021 --> 00:08:39,542
You two have to back off.

143
00:08:39,662 --> 00:08:41,565
Why should I back off?
You back off, dude.

144
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:44,276
Excuse me, this is my apartment,
and she's my roommate's sister.

145
00:08:44,437 --> 00:08:47,123
- So what? You've already got Penny!
- How do I have Penny?

146
00:08:47,243 --> 00:08:49,114
In what universe do I have Penny?

147
00:08:50,511 --> 00:08:52,564
- So I can have Penny?
- Hell, no!

148
00:08:53,946 --> 00:08:56,155
Excuse me.
Can I interject something?

149
00:08:57,799 --> 00:09:01,001
I'm ordering pizza online.
Is everyone okay with pepperoni?

150
00:09:03,233 --> 00:09:06,290
- Sheldon, can I talk to you in private?
- I guess.

151
00:09:06,931 --> 00:09:09,177
Don't worry. I was going
to order you cheese-less.

152
00:09:09,297 --> 00:09:10,643
- Thank you.
- It's okay.

153
00:09:10,763 --> 00:09:13,769
Lactose intolerance
is nothing to be embarrassed about.

154
00:09:15,673 --> 00:09:18,514
I'm a fancy Indian man.
We invented pajamas.

155
00:09:19,442 --> 00:09:21,816
Hey, look at me.
I don't have a foreskin.

156
00:09:32,943 --> 00:09:36,161
Are you aware that your sister
is an incredibly attractive woman?

157
00:09:39,002 --> 00:09:41,245
She certainly has the symmetry
and low body fat

158
00:09:41,365 --> 00:09:43,580
that Western culture deems desirable.

159
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:45,854
It's noteworthy,
at other points in history,

160
00:09:45,974 --> 00:09:47,974
heavier women
were the standard for beauty

161
00:09:48,094 --> 00:09:50,383
because their girth
suggested affluence.

162
00:09:51,341 --> 00:09:52,650
That's fascinating...

163
00:09:52,770 --> 00:09:55,508
I didn't say it was fascinating.
I said it was noteworthy.

164
00:09:56,003 --> 00:09:57,741
All right... noted.

165
00:09:58,793 --> 00:10:01,717
But my point is
that Koothrappali and Wolowitz,

166
00:10:02,598 --> 00:10:04,583
they're hitting on your sister.

167
00:10:08,570 --> 00:10:09,403
Okay.

168
00:10:09,734 --> 00:10:12,259
You know, I don't want to criticize
your rhetorical style,

169
00:10:12,379 --> 00:10:14,625
but we'd be a lot further along
in this conversation

170
00:10:14,745 --> 00:10:16,534
if you'd begun with that thought.

171
00:10:16,978 --> 00:10:18,286
- Great...
- I'm saying

172
00:10:18,449 --> 00:10:21,540
we took quite an unnecessary detour from
what I now understand to be your thesis.

173
00:10:21,701 --> 00:10:22,673
Whatever.

174
00:10:24,272 --> 00:10:26,044
You have to do something about it.

175
00:10:26,610 --> 00:10:29,048
- Why?
- Because she's your sister.

176
00:10:30,299 --> 00:10:31,672
I don't understand.

177
00:10:32,221 --> 00:10:34,615
Yes, we shared a uterus
for nine months,

178
00:10:34,735 --> 00:10:37,869
but since then we've pretty much
gone our own separate ways.

179
00:10:38,792 --> 00:10:41,100
Okay, consider this.

180
00:10:41,467 --> 00:10:43,046
With your father gone,

181
00:10:43,166 --> 00:10:44,854
it is your responsibility

182
00:10:45,196 --> 00:10:48,050
to make sure that Missy
chooses a suitable mate.

183
00:10:50,196 --> 00:10:51,687
I hadn't considered that.

184
00:10:52,734 --> 00:10:54,453
We do share DNA.

185
00:10:54,802 --> 00:10:57,201
So there is the possibility,
however remote,

186
00:10:57,363 --> 00:10:59,008
that resting in her loins

187
00:10:59,153 --> 00:11:02,605
is the potential for another individual
as remarkable as myself.

188
00:11:03,438 --> 00:11:05,042
Exactly.

189
00:11:05,662 --> 00:11:08,612
And you owe it to yourself
and to posterity

190
00:11:08,732 --> 00:11:12,424
to protect the genetic integrity
of your sister's future offspring.

191
00:11:14,596 --> 00:11:15,842
You're right.

192
00:11:16,141 --> 00:11:18,394
If someone wants to get
at Missy's Fallopian tubes,

193
00:11:18,514 --> 00:11:20,335
they'll have to go through me.

194
00:11:29,977 --> 00:11:31,850
I am Shiva the Destroyer!

195
00:11:31,970 --> 00:11:33,651
I will have the woman.

196
00:11:35,068 --> 00:11:38,477
I'm warning you,
I was judo champion at math camp.

197
00:11:39,251 --> 00:11:41,741
All right, now that's enough
juvenile squabbling.

198
00:11:41,861 --> 00:11:43,580
You stop it. Stop it, I say!

199
00:11:44,924 --> 00:11:46,915
I'm going to settle this right now.

200
00:11:47,263 --> 00:11:49,537
Neither of you are good enough
for my sister.

201
00:11:49,747 --> 00:11:51,338
Who are you to decide that?

202
00:11:51,499 --> 00:11:54,464
He's the man of his family.
You have to respect his wishes.

203
00:11:54,584 --> 00:11:56,682
- You're out, too, by the way.
- Say what?

204
00:11:56,957 --> 00:11:58,696
It's nothing personal. I'd just prefer

205
00:11:58,816 --> 00:12:01,032
if my future niece or nephew
didn't become flatulent

206
00:12:01,152 --> 00:12:03,201
every time they ate an eskimo pie.

207
00:12:09,610 --> 00:12:11,232
What are you so happy about?

208
00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:12,543
I'm not happy.

209
00:12:12,795 --> 00:12:15,217
It's the medication.
I can't stop smiling.

210
00:12:21,313 --> 00:12:24,515
Now that Leonard's made me aware
how high the genetic stakes are...

211
00:12:24,635 --> 00:12:27,875
we have to face the fact that none of
you are suitable mates for my sister.

212
00:12:28,345 --> 00:12:30,855
Wait a minute.
Leonard made you aware of that?

213
00:12:32,649 --> 00:12:34,703
We all make mistakes.
Let's move on.

214
00:12:35,499 --> 00:12:37,980
Excuse me, I think you're missing
a big opportunity here.

215
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:38,886
How so?

216
00:12:39,047 --> 00:12:42,382
Everybody knows genetic diversity
produces the strongest offspring.

217
00:12:42,732 --> 00:12:45,887
Why not put a little mocha
in the family latte?

218
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:50,559
In principle, you have a point.

219
00:12:50,733 --> 00:12:52,696
But as a practical matter,
need I remind you

220
00:12:52,864 --> 00:12:54,819
that it takes experimental
pharmaceuticals

221
00:12:54,939 --> 00:12:57,479
to simply enable you
to speak to the opposite sex.

222
00:12:58,610 --> 00:13:01,604
I think you're focusing
entirely too much on the drugs.

223
00:13:07,775 --> 00:13:09,160
Is it 'cause I'm Jewish?

224
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:12,248
'Cause I'd kill my rabbi
with a pork chop to be with your sister.

225
00:13:19,017 --> 00:13:20,890
This has nothing to do with religion.

226
00:13:21,010 --> 00:13:23,547
This has to do with the fact
that you're a tiny, tiny man

227
00:13:23,667 --> 00:13:25,485
who still lives with his mother.

228
00:13:26,446 --> 00:13:28,643
Sheldon, you are really
being unreasonable.

229
00:13:28,938 --> 00:13:29,770
Am I?

230
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:33,902
Here, eat this cheese without farting
and you can sleep with my sister.

231
00:13:35,674 --> 00:13:36,840
Oh, really?

232
00:13:44,001 --> 00:13:46,788
Shelly, can I speak to you for a minute?
Alone.

233
00:13:47,862 --> 00:13:50,436
Why does everyone suddenly
want to talk to me alone?

234
00:13:50,556 --> 00:13:52,652
Usually nobody wants
to be alone with me.

235
00:13:59,165 --> 00:14:01,400
We all make mistakes.
Let's move on.

236
00:14:04,889 --> 00:14:07,516
I'm not even going to ask
why you're pimping me out for cheese.

237
00:14:09,345 --> 00:14:12,605
But since when do you care at all
about who I sleep with?

238
00:14:13,112 --> 00:14:15,068
Truthfully, I've never given it
any thought,

239
00:14:15,188 --> 00:14:18,652
but it has been pointed out to me
that you carry DNA of great potential.

240
00:14:18,964 --> 00:14:21,676
- What on earth are you talking about?
- Let me explain.

241
00:14:21,796 --> 00:14:24,887
You see,
I'm a superior genetic mutation,

242
00:14:25,007 --> 00:14:28,162
an improvement
on the existing mediocre stock.

243
00:14:30,038 --> 00:14:32,625
And what do you mean, "mediocre stock"?

244
00:14:32,786 --> 00:14:33,876
That would be you.

245
00:14:35,471 --> 00:14:38,682
But residing within you,
is the potential for another me.

246
00:14:39,010 --> 00:14:42,659
Perhaps even taller, smarter,
and less prone to freckling,

247
00:14:43,001 --> 00:14:44,845
a Sheldon 2.0, if you will.

248
00:14:46,554 --> 00:14:47,798
"Sheldon 2.0"?

249
00:14:48,010 --> 00:14:49,047
Exactly.

250
00:14:49,291 --> 00:14:53,023
Now, I am not saying that I should be
the sole decider of who you mate with.

251
00:14:53,143 --> 00:14:54,896
If you're not attracted to the suitor,

252
00:14:55,058 --> 00:14:57,148
the likelihood of conception
will be reduced.

253
00:14:57,310 --> 00:14:59,393
- You have got to be kidding me.
- Not at all.

254
00:14:59,684 --> 00:15:02,730
Frequent coitus dramatically
increases the odds of fertilization.

255
00:15:04,034 --> 00:15:06,006
Okay, Shelly, sit down.

256
00:15:09,504 --> 00:15:12,946
Now I've lived my whole life dealing
with the fact that my twin brother is,

257
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:14,523
as mom puts it,

258
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:17,168
"one of God's special, little people".

259
00:15:18,081 --> 00:15:20,486
I always thought I was more
like a cuckoo bird.

260
00:15:20,606 --> 00:15:24,573
You know, a superior creature whose egg
is placed in the nest of ordinary birds.

261
00:15:24,853 --> 00:15:27,179
Of course, the newly hatched cuckoo
eats all the food,

262
00:15:27,341 --> 00:15:29,632
leaving the ordinary siblings
to starve to death.

263
00:15:30,706 --> 00:15:33,302
Luckily for you,
that's where the metaphor ended.

264
00:15:35,008 --> 00:15:36,967
I thought it ended at "cuckoo".

265
00:15:39,749 --> 00:15:41,049
You listen to me.

266
00:15:41,212 --> 00:15:43,609
If you want to start acting
like a brother who cares about me,

267
00:15:43,729 --> 00:15:45,898
then terrific. Bring it on.

268
00:15:46,386 --> 00:15:49,175
But you try one time to tell me
who I should be sleeping with,

269
00:15:49,295 --> 00:15:51,150
and you and I are going
to go round and round

270
00:15:51,270 --> 00:15:53,710
the way we did when we were little.
Remember?

271
00:15:57,728 --> 00:16:00,045
- I have an alternate proposal.
- Go on.

272
00:16:00,780 --> 00:16:01,944
You donate eggs.

273
00:16:02,151 --> 00:16:03,977
We will place them in cryogenic storage.

274
00:16:04,118 --> 00:16:07,009
I will find an appropriate
sperm donor for your eggs,

275
00:16:07,129 --> 00:16:09,513
have them fertilized
and implanted in you.

276
00:16:09,674 --> 00:16:11,620
That way, everybody wins.

277
00:16:20,458 --> 00:16:21,609
Correction.

278
00:16:21,770 --> 00:16:24,073
Missy can date whoever she wants.

279
00:16:25,990 --> 00:16:27,502
Look, we have to settle this.

280
00:16:27,622 --> 00:16:28,642
I agree.

281
00:16:28,762 --> 00:16:31,753
Sheldon's sister is hiding at Penny's
because we've all been hitting on her

282
00:16:31,873 --> 00:16:33,903
- at the same time.
- She's not hiding.

283
00:16:34,039 --> 00:16:37,077
She needed privacy to call her
grandmother who's apparently very sick.

284
00:16:37,197 --> 00:16:39,478
And then I believe
she has to wash her hair.

285
00:16:40,559 --> 00:16:42,688
You poor, deluded bastard.

286
00:16:43,165 --> 00:16:45,539
- Don't start with me.
- You want to go again? Let's go.

287
00:16:45,659 --> 00:16:46,605
Sit down.

288
00:16:48,522 --> 00:16:51,141
If we're going to fight over Missy,
let's do it the right way.

289
00:16:51,348 --> 00:16:52,729
The honorable way.

290
00:16:54,394 --> 00:16:55,493
Take that!

291
00:16:56,380 --> 00:16:57,638
You want some more?

292
00:17:01,246 --> 00:17:02,413
And he's down!

293
00:17:02,545 --> 00:17:05,221
One, two, three...

294
00:17:05,992 --> 00:17:07,363
Come on! Get up!

295
00:17:07,587 --> 00:17:08,838
Stay down, bitch!

296
00:17:11,101 --> 00:17:12,875
Nine, ten.

297
00:17:14,895 --> 00:17:16,489
Natural selection at work.

298
00:17:16,797 --> 00:17:18,515
I weep for humanity.

299
00:17:19,577 --> 00:17:22,143
Excuse me while I go tell
Missy the good news.

300
00:17:28,955 --> 00:17:30,809
- Leonard.
- Hi, Penny. How's it going?

301
00:17:30,929 --> 00:17:33,388
That guy Mike that you were dating,
is that still going on?

302
00:17:33,588 --> 00:17:34,801
Pretty much. Why?

303
00:17:34,921 --> 00:17:37,762
Nothing, just catching up. By the way,
may I speak to Missy, please?

304
00:17:39,110 --> 00:17:40,455
Of course.

305
00:17:41,979 --> 00:17:44,624
- Hi, Leonard. What's up?
- Since you're leaving tomorrow,

306
00:17:44,744 --> 00:17:47,069
I was wondering
if you'd like to go to dinner with me.

307
00:17:47,805 --> 00:17:49,864
That's so sweet. But no thanks.

308
00:17:53,125 --> 00:17:55,233
- Do you have other plans or...
- No.

309
00:17:59,362 --> 00:18:00,469
All right.

310
00:18:02,167 --> 00:18:05,442
- Enjoy the rest of your evening.
- Thanks. See ya.

311
00:18:12,994 --> 00:18:15,324
Here's something we didn't anticipate.

312
00:18:21,245 --> 00:18:22,604
What do you want, Howard?

313
00:18:23,044 --> 00:18:25,342
I'm fine. Thanks for asking.

314
00:18:26,731 --> 00:18:28,402
I've come to call on Missy.

315
00:18:32,791 --> 00:18:35,222
- Hi, Howard.
- The Amazing Howard.

316
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:39,579
- Do you like magic?
- Not really. No.

317
00:18:40,941 --> 00:18:42,875
Then you are in for a treat.

318
00:18:45,035 --> 00:18:47,192
Behold, an ordinary cane.

319
00:19:20,239 --> 00:19:22,577
Thank you. I apprec...

320
00:19:24,456 --> 00:19:25,657
Apprec...

321
00:19:27,036 --> 00:19:28,259
Appree...

322
00:19:30,458 --> 00:19:33,133
Oh, honey.
Is your medication wearing off?

323
00:19:36,849 --> 00:19:38,248
Well, hi, cutie pie.

324
00:19:38,530 --> 00:19:40,248
I was hoping you'd show up.

325
00:20:08,601 --> 00:20:10,759
We had a dog who made
a noise like that.

326
00:20:11,227 --> 00:20:12,984
Had to put him down.

327
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:19,276
Any news you want me
to pass on to Mom?

328
00:20:19,924 --> 00:20:23,246
Well, she might be interested to know
that I have refocused my research

329
00:20:23,366 --> 00:20:26,354
from bosonic string theory
to heterotic string theory.

330
00:20:27,465 --> 00:20:29,297
I'll just tell her you say "hey".

331
00:20:32,193 --> 00:20:34,146
Well, it was pleasant seeing you,

332
00:20:34,266 --> 00:20:36,712
other than that business
with my testicles.

333
00:20:38,746 --> 00:20:40,034
Come on, Shelly.

334
00:20:46,042 --> 00:20:48,041
I want you to know
I'm very proud of you.

335
00:20:48,528 --> 00:20:49,333
Really?

336
00:20:49,453 --> 00:20:53,206
Yep, I'm always bragging to my friends
about my brother, the rocket scientist.

337
00:20:54,573 --> 00:20:57,175
You tell people I'm a rocket scientist?

338
00:20:58,376 --> 00:20:59,302
Well, yeah.

339
00:20:59,463 --> 00:21:01,430
I'm a theoretical physicist.

340
00:21:01,763 --> 00:21:04,735
- What's the difference?
- What's the difference?

341
00:21:05,971 --> 00:21:07,173
Good bye, Shelly.

342
00:21:07,436 --> 00:21:09,185
My God!
