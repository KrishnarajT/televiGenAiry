1
00:00:01,052 --> 00:00:03,013
Here we go.
Pad thai, no peanuts.

2
00:00:03,133 --> 00:00:04,469
But does it have peanut oil?

3
00:00:04,692 --> 00:00:05,842
I'm not sure.

4
00:00:05,967 --> 00:00:08,556
Everyone keep an eye on Howard
in case he starts to swell up.

5
00:00:10,059 --> 00:00:12,607
Since it's not bee season,
you can have my epinephrine.

6
00:00:13,809 --> 00:00:16,426
- Are there any chopsticks.
- No need. This is Thai food.

7
00:00:16,634 --> 00:00:17,752
Here we go.

8
00:00:17,998 --> 00:00:20,727
Thailand has had the fork since
the latter half of the 19th Century.

9
00:00:20,917 --> 00:00:23,145
Interestingly  they don't put the fork
in their mouth--

10
00:00:23,321 --> 00:00:26,280
they use it to put the food on a spoon
which then goes into their mouth.

11
00:00:27,814 --> 00:00:29,514
Ask him for a napkin.
I dare you.

12
00:00:31,674 --> 00:00:32,674
I'll get it.

13
00:00:33,276 --> 00:00:34,967
Do I look puffy? I feel puffy.

14
00:00:36,877 --> 00:00:38,327
- Hey, Leonard.
- Oh, hi, Penny.

15
00:00:38,447 --> 00:00:40,866
- Am I interrupting?
- No. You're not swelling, Howard.

16
00:00:41,495 --> 00:00:43,609
Look at my fingers.
They're like Vienna sausages.

17
00:00:44,322 --> 00:00:47,149
- Sounds like you have company.
- They're not going anywhere.

18
00:00:48,588 --> 00:00:51,159
So, you're coming home from work.
That's great. How was work?

19
00:00:51,365 --> 00:00:52,915
You know, it's a Cheesecake Factory.

20
00:00:53,091 --> 00:00:55,028
People order cheesecake
and I bring it to them.

21
00:00:55,485 --> 00:00:59,924
So you kind of act like
a carbohydrate delivery system.

22
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:04,304
Yeah. Call it whatever you want,
I get minimum wage.

23
00:01:06,968 --> 00:01:08,731
I was wondering if you could help me out

24
00:01:08,884 --> 00:01:10,184
- with something.
- Yes.

25
00:01:11,422 --> 00:01:12,843
Great. I'm having some furniture

26
00:01:13,019 --> 00:01:14,933
delivered tomorrow
and I may not be here, so...

27
00:01:17,349 --> 00:01:18,349
Hello.

28
00:01:22,881 --> 00:01:24,651
- I'm sorry?
- Haven't you ever been told

29
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:26,539
how beautiful you are
in flawless Russian?

30
00:01:27,322 --> 00:01:28,344
No, I haven't.

31
00:01:28,524 --> 00:01:29,524
Get used to it.

32
00:01:30,682 --> 00:01:32,247
Yeah. I probably won't.

33
00:01:33,208 --> 00:01:34,371
- Hey, Sheldon.
- Hi.

34
00:01:34,608 --> 00:01:35,618
Hey, Raj.

35
00:01:37,984 --> 00:01:39,319
Still not talking to me, huh?

36
00:01:39,689 --> 00:01:41,609
Don't take it personally,
it's his pathology.

37
00:01:41,763 --> 00:01:42,993
He can't talk to women.

38
00:01:43,147 --> 00:01:45,313
It can't talk to atractive woman,
or in your case,

39
00:01:45,442 --> 00:01:47,318
a cheesecake- scented goddess.

40
00:01:47,993 --> 00:01:50,288
So there's gonna be
some furniture delivered?

41
00:01:50,442 --> 00:01:52,506
If it gets here and I'm not here,
could you sign

42
00:01:52,699 --> 00:01:54,339
and have them put it in my apartment?

43
00:01:54,542 --> 00:01:55,565
No problem.

44
00:01:55,738 --> 00:01:57,438
Great. Here's my spare key.
Thank you.

45
00:02:00,045 --> 00:02:01,054
Penny, wait.

46
00:02:04,475 --> 00:02:06,942
If you don't have any other plans,
do you want to join us

47
00:02:07,102 --> 00:02:09,247
for Thai food
and a Superman movie marathon?

48
00:02:09,654 --> 00:02:12,240
A marathon?
How many Superman movies are there?

49
00:02:12,905 --> 00:02:14,291
You're kidding, right?

50
00:02:15,799 --> 00:02:18,213
I do like the one where Lois Lane
falls from the helicopter

51
00:02:18,354 --> 00:02:20,925
and Superman swooshes down
and catches her. Which one was that?

52
00:02:21,111 --> 00:02:22,156
One.

53
00:02:23,258 --> 00:02:26,259
You realize that scene
was rife with scientific inaccuracy.

54
00:02:26,899 --> 00:02:28,478
Yes, I know, men can't fly.

55
00:02:28,725 --> 00:02:30,179
No.
Let's assume that they can.

56
00:02:31,996 --> 00:02:33,122
Lois Lane is falling,

57
00:02:33,288 --> 00:02:35,912
accelerating at an initial rate
of 32 feet per second per second.

58
00:02:36,125 --> 00:02:39,111
Superman swoops down to save her
by reaching out two arms of steel.

59
00:02:39,319 --> 00:02:40,960
Miss Lane, who is now traveling

60
00:02:41,182 --> 00:02:42,754
at approximately 120 miles an hour,

61
00:02:42,966 --> 00:02:45,540
hits them and is immediately
sliced into three equal pieces.

62
00:02:48,245 --> 00:02:51,387
Unless Superman matches
her speed and decelerates.

63
00:02:51,746 --> 00:02:54,841
In what space, sir?
She's two feet above the ground.

64
00:02:55,647 --> 00:02:58,171
Frankly, if he really loved her,
he'd let her hit the pavement.

65
00:02:58,324 --> 00:02:59,737
It'd be a more merciful death.

66
00:03:00,627 --> 00:03:04,670
Excuse me, your entire argument
is predicated on the assumption

67
00:03:04,881 --> 00:03:06,973
that Superman's flight
is a feat of strength.

68
00:03:07,101 --> 00:03:09,286
Are you listening  to yourself?
It is well established

69
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:10,965
that his flight is a feat of strength.

70
00:03:11,089 --> 00:03:13,369
It is an extension of his
ability to leap tall buildings,

71
00:03:13,496 --> 00:03:15,939
an ability he derives from
exposure to Earth's yellow sun.

72
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,766
And how does he fly at night?

73
00:03:18,118 --> 00:03:20,220
A combination
of the moon's solar reflection

74
00:03:20,361 --> 00:03:22,921
and the energy-storage capacity
of Kryptonian skin cells.

75
00:03:24,705 --> 00:03:26,161
I'm just gonna go wash up.

76
00:03:26,659 --> 00:03:29,641
I have 2,600 comic books in there.
I challenge you

77
00:03:29,806 --> 00:03:32,011
to find a single reference
to Kryptonian skin cells.

78
00:03:32,222 --> 00:03:33,503
Challenge accepted.

79
00:03:37,493 --> 00:03:38,620
We're locked out.

80
00:03:39,230 --> 00:03:40,918
Also, the pretty girl left.

Her apartment's on the fourth floor
but the elevator's broken, so...

89
00:04:17,529 --> 00:04:19,854
You're just gonna be done?
Okay. Cool. Thanks

90
00:04:21,464 --> 00:04:22,988
We'll just bring it up ourselves.

91
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,512
I hardly think so.

92
00:04:25,933 --> 00:04:26,943
Why not?

93
00:04:27,413 --> 00:04:29,054
Well, we don't have a dolly,

94
00:04:29,291 --> 00:04:32,685
or lifting belts
or any measurable upper-body strength.

95
00:04:33,834 --> 00:04:35,872
We don't need strength--
we're physicists.

96
00:04:36,355 --> 00:04:38,645
We are the intellectual
descendants of Archimedes.

97
00:04:38,809 --> 00:04:41,028
Give me a fulcrum and a lever
and I can move the Earth.

98
00:04:41,193 --> 00:04:43,034
It's just a matter of...
I don't have this.

99
00:04:45,095 --> 00:04:46,595
Archimedes would be so proud.

100
00:04:53,626 --> 00:04:54,929
Do you have any ideas?

101
00:04:55,573 --> 00:04:58,259
Yes, but they all involve
a green lantern and a power ring.

102
00:05:00,348 --> 00:05:02,649
Easy... easy.

103
00:05:08,113 --> 00:05:10,662
Now we've got an inclined plane.
The force required to lift

104
00:05:10,819 --> 00:05:12,897
is reduced by the sine
of the angle of the stairs,

105
00:05:13,054 --> 00:05:14,600
call it 30 degrees, so, about half.

106
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:16,372
Exactly half.

107
00:05:18,609 --> 00:05:19,609
Exactly half.

108
00:05:21,313 --> 00:05:22,313
Let's push.

109
00:05:26,692 --> 00:05:28,266
See, it's moving, this is easy.

110
00:05:28,936 --> 00:05:30,146
It's all in the math.

111
00:05:31,266 --> 00:05:33,524
- What's your formula for the corner?
- What?

112
00:05:40,079 --> 00:05:41,101
Okay, no problem.

113
00:05:41,324 --> 00:05:43,120
Just come up here,
help me pull and turn.

114
00:05:48,176 --> 00:05:50,540
Ah, gravity,
thou art a heartless bitch.

115
00:05:52,986 --> 00:05:56,462
You do understand that our efforts here
will in no way increase the odds

116
00:05:56,626 --> 00:05:58,563
of you having sexual congress
with this woman.

117
00:05:59,982 --> 00:06:02,332
Men do things for women
without expecting sex.

118
00:06:02,777 --> 00:06:04,571
Those would be men who just had sex.

119
00:06:06,374 --> 00:06:08,252
I'm doing this
to be a good neighbor.

120
00:06:09,292 --> 00:06:11,680
In any case, there's no way
it could lower the odds.

121
00:06:14,710 --> 00:06:15,732
Almost there.

122
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:17,709
Almost there.

123
00:06:18,777 --> 00:06:20,292
- Almost there.
- No, we're not.

124
00:06:20,456 --> 00:06:22,189
- I'm sorry.
- No, we're not!

125
00:06:23,977 --> 00:06:25,445
Watch your fingers.

126
00:06:25,667 --> 00:06:27,181
Oh, God, my fingers!

127
00:06:29,595 --> 00:06:31,296
- You okay?
- No, her...

128
00:06:31,807 --> 00:06:34,167
Great Caesar's ghost,
look at this place.

129
00:06:36,725 --> 00:06:37,987
So Penny's a little messy.

130
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:39,705
A little messy?

131
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,930
The Mandelbrot set of complex
numbers is a little messy.

132
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:44,161
This is chaos.

133
00:06:44,898 --> 00:06:45,898
Excuse me.

134
00:06:46,410 --> 00:06:48,038
Explain to me
an organizational system

135
00:06:48,202 --> 00:06:50,256
where a tray of flatware
on a couch is valid.

136
00:06:51,549 --> 00:06:53,046
I'm just inferring this is a couch

137
00:06:53,211 --> 00:06:55,079
because the evidence suggests
the coffee table

138
00:06:55,243 --> 00:06:56,617
is having a tiny garage sale.

139
00:06:58,374 --> 00:07:00,341
Did it ever occur to you
that not everyone has

140
00:07:00,518 --> 00:07:02,701
the compulsive need to sort,
organize and label

141
00:07:02,904 --> 00:07:04,242
the entire world around them?

142
00:07:05,243 --> 00:07:06,243
No.

143
00:07:07,798 --> 00:07:08,798
Well, they don't.

144
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:10,753
Hard as it may be for you to believe,

145
00:07:10,929 --> 00:07:14,282
most people don't sort their breakfast
cereal numerically by fiber content.

146
00:07:15,878 --> 00:07:18,414
Excuse me, but I think we've both
found that helpful at times.

147
00:07:21,970 --> 00:07:23,912
- Come on, we should go.
- Hang on.

148
00:07:25,775 --> 00:07:27,935
- What are you doing?
- I'm straightening up.

149
00:07:28,713 --> 00:07:30,222
This is not your home.

150
00:07:30,421 --> 00:07:33,908
This is not anyone's home.
This is a swirling vortex of entropy.

151
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:39,250
When the transvestite lived here,
you didn't care how he kept the place.

152
00:07:39,447 --> 00:07:40,930
Because it was immaculate.

153
00:07:41,050 --> 00:07:43,191
I mean, you opened
that man's closet,

154
00:07:43,344 --> 00:07:44,976
it was left to right evening gowns,

155
00:07:45,117 --> 00:07:47,301
cocktail dresses,
then his police uniforms.

156
00:07:48,910 --> 00:07:50,395
What were you doing in his closet?

157
00:07:50,569 --> 00:07:52,617
I helped him run
some cable for a web cam.

158
00:07:54,718 --> 00:07:56,972
This just arrived,
we just brought this up... just now.

159
00:07:57,314 --> 00:07:59,357
Great.
Was it hard getting it up the stairs?

160
00:07:59,593 --> 00:08:00,821
- No.
- "No"?

161
00:08:01,021 --> 00:08:02,066
No.

162
00:08:02,527 --> 00:08:03,537
No.

163
00:08:04,647 --> 00:08:06,218
Well, we'll get out of your hair.

164
00:08:06,378 --> 00:08:07,797
Okay, great.
Thank you again.

165
00:08:12,874 --> 00:08:15,562
I just want you to know
that you don't have to live like this.

166
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:17,870
I'm here for you.

167
00:08:20,225 --> 00:08:21,625
What's he talking about?

168
00:08:23,108 --> 00:08:24,628
- It's a joke.
- I don't get it.

169
00:08:24,827 --> 00:08:26,243
Yeah, he didn't tell it right.

170
00:09:22,782 --> 00:09:24,073
Penny's sleeping.

171
00:09:26,573 --> 00:09:27,684
Are you insane?

172
00:09:27,806 --> 00:09:29,673
You can't just break
into a woman's apartment

173
00:09:29,827 --> 00:09:31,428
in the middle
of the night and clean.

174
00:09:31,641 --> 00:09:34,091
I had no choice.
I couldn't sleep knowing

175
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,237
that just outside my bedroom
was our living room,

176
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:38,477
and just outside our living room
was that hallway,

177
00:09:38,618 --> 00:09:41,447
and immediately adjacent
to the hallway was... this.

178
00:09:43,757 --> 00:09:45,520
Do you realize
that if Penny wakes up,

179
00:09:45,814 --> 00:09:48,498
there is no reasonable explanation
as to why we're here.

180
00:09:49,095 --> 00:09:51,232
I just gave you
a reasonable explanation.

181
00:09:52,227 --> 00:09:54,360
No, no, you gave me
an explanation.

182
00:09:54,728 --> 00:09:57,808
Its reasonableness will be determined
by a jury of your peers.

183
00:09:58,721 --> 00:10:01,117
Don't be ridiculous.
I have no peers.

184
00:10:01,881 --> 00:10:03,537
We have to get out of here.

185
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:09,347
You might want to speak
in a lower register.

186
00:10:09,815 --> 00:10:10,825
What?

187
00:10:11,588 --> 00:10:13,290
Evolution has made women sensitive

188
00:10:13,419 --> 00:10:15,109
to high-pitched noises
while they sleep

189
00:10:15,285 --> 00:10:17,282
so that they'll be
roused by a crying baby.

190
00:10:17,486 --> 00:10:18,975
If you want to avoid waking her,

191
00:10:19,270 --> 00:10:20,865
speak in a lower register.

192
00:10:22,754 --> 00:10:24,105
That's ridiculous!

193
00:10:27,338 --> 00:10:28,371
No.

194
00:10:29,231 --> 00:10:30,778
"That's ridiculous."

195
00:10:34,189 --> 00:10:35,189
Fine.

196
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:39,976
I accept your premise.
Now, please, let's go.

197
00:10:40,304 --> 00:10:42,313
I'm not leaving until I'm done.

198
00:10:46,816 --> 00:10:49,670
If you have time to lean,
you have time to clean.

199
00:10:53,877 --> 00:10:55,227
Oh, what the hell.

200
00:11:01,288 --> 00:11:02,288
Morning.

201
00:11:03,013 --> 00:11:04,023
Morning.

202
00:11:04,693 --> 00:11:06,846
I have to say
I slept splendidly.

203
00:11:08,091 --> 00:11:10,602
Granted, not long,
but just deeply and well.

204
00:11:11,375 --> 00:11:12,615
I'm not surprised.

205
00:11:12,803 --> 00:11:14,441
A well-known folk cure for insomnia

206
00:11:14,629 --> 00:11:17,271
is to break in your neighbor's
apartment and clean.

207
00:11:18,407 --> 00:11:19,407
Sarcasm?

208
00:11:20,210 --> 00:11:21,210
You think?

209
00:11:22,153 --> 00:11:24,551
Granted, my methods may have
been somewhat unorthodox,

210
00:11:24,813 --> 00:11:27,502
but I think the end result
will be a measurable enhancement

211
00:11:27,622 --> 00:11:30,020
- to Penny's quality of life
- You've convinced me.

212
00:11:30,142 --> 00:11:32,821
Maybe tonight we should sneak in
and shampoo her carpet.

213
00:11:33,599 --> 00:11:36,165
- You don't think that crosses a line?
- Yes.

214
00:11:36,485 --> 00:11:37,721
For God's sake,

215
00:11:37,891 --> 00:11:41,653
do I have to hold up a sarcasm sign
every time I open my mouth?

216
00:11:42,141 --> 00:11:43,791
You have a sarcasm sign?

217
00:11:46,756 --> 00:11:48,743
No, I do not have
a sarcasm sign.

218
00:11:49,791 --> 00:11:51,980
Do you want some cereal?
I feel so good today,

219
00:11:52,134 --> 00:11:54,346
I'm gonna choose from
the low-fiber end of the shelf.

220
00:11:54,516 --> 00:11:55,916
Hello, Honey Puffs.

221
00:11:56,923 --> 00:11:58,196
Son of a bitch!

222
00:12:00,225 --> 00:12:01,225
Penny's up.

223
00:12:02,232 --> 00:12:04,620
You sick geeky bastards!

224
00:12:06,141 --> 00:12:07,799
How did she know it was us?

225
00:12:09,168 --> 00:12:11,495
I may have left a suggested
organizational schematic

226
00:12:11,669 --> 00:12:12,904
for her bedroom closet.

227
00:12:14,576 --> 00:12:15,883
God, this is gonna be bad.

228
00:12:16,135 --> 00:12:18,353
Good-bye, Honey Puffs.
Hello, Big Bran.

229
00:12:19,710 --> 00:12:22,122
You came into my apartment last
night while I was sleeping?!

230
00:12:22,294 --> 00:12:23,528
Yes, but only to clean.

231
00:12:23,702 --> 00:12:26,321
Really more to organize.
You're not actually dirty, per se.

232
00:12:27,372 --> 00:12:28,822
Give me back my key.

233
00:12:30,411 --> 00:12:31,519
I'm very, very sorry.

234
00:12:31,693 --> 00:12:33,606
Do you understand
how creepy this is?

235
00:12:33,882 --> 00:12:35,966
Oh, yes, we discussed it
at length last night.

236
00:12:36,391 --> 00:12:38,587
In my apartment,
while I was sleeping?!

237
00:12:38,864 --> 00:12:41,864
And snoring. And that's probably
just a sinus infection.

238
00:12:42,150 --> 00:12:43,530
But it could be sleep apnea.

239
00:12:43,704 --> 00:12:45,647
You might want to see
an otolaryngologist.

240
00:12:48,353 --> 00:12:49,586
A throat doctor.

241
00:12:51,333 --> 00:12:54,227
And what kind of doctor
removes shoes from asses?

242
00:12:55,359 --> 00:12:56,699
Depending on the depth,

243
00:12:56,828 --> 00:12:59,510
that's either
a... proctologist

244
00:12:59,703 --> 00:13:01,173
or a general surgeon.

245
00:13:12,491 --> 00:13:13,947
I think what you're feeling

246
00:13:14,102 --> 00:13:16,040
is perfectly valid
and maybe a little bit later

247
00:13:16,194 --> 00:13:19,279
when you're feeling a little less...
for lack of a better word-- violated,

248
00:13:19,399 --> 00:13:21,037
maybe we can talk
about this some more.

249
00:13:21,157 --> 00:13:23,475
- Stay away from me.
- Sure, that's another way to go.

250
00:13:24,651 --> 00:13:25,693
Penny, Penny!

251
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:27,578
Just to clarify,

252
00:13:27,713 --> 00:13:30,193
because there will be
a discussion when you leave,

253
00:13:31,666 --> 00:13:33,549
is your objection
solely to our presence

254
00:13:33,723 --> 00:13:35,479
in the apartment
while you were sleeping,

255
00:13:35,655 --> 00:13:39,975
or do you also object to the imposition
of a new organizational paradigm.

256
00:13:46,395 --> 00:13:48,495
Well, that was
a little non-responsive.

257
00:13:49,295 --> 00:13:52,159
You are going to march yourself
over there right now and apologize.

258
00:13:57,258 --> 00:13:58,258
What's funny?

259
00:13:58,654 --> 00:14:00,286
That wasn't sarcasm?

260
00:14:03,071 --> 00:14:05,656
Boy, you are all over
the place this morning.

261
00:14:09,717 --> 00:14:12,436
I have a master's and two Ph.D.s,
I should not have to do this.

262
00:14:13,709 --> 00:14:14,788
What?!

263
00:14:15,402 --> 00:14:17,677
I am truly sorry for what
happened last night.

264
00:14:17,802 --> 00:14:19,365
I take full responsibility.

265
00:14:19,977 --> 00:14:22,344
And I hope that it won't color
your opinion of Leonard,

266
00:14:22,595 --> 00:14:26,059
who is not only a wonderful guy,
but also, I hear,

267
00:14:26,349 --> 00:14:27,994
a gentle and
thorough lover.

268
00:14:40,636 --> 00:14:42,086
I did what I could.

269
00:14:46,864 --> 00:14:47,887
Hey, Raj.

270
00:14:53,359 --> 00:14:54,359
Hey, listen.

271
00:14:54,942 --> 00:14:57,238
I don't know if you heard about
what happened last night.

272
00:14:57,431 --> 00:14:58,814
but I'm really upset about it.

273
00:14:58,974 --> 00:15:01,144
I mean, they just...
they let themselves into my place

274
00:15:01,335 --> 00:15:03,529
and then they cleaned it.
Can you even believe that?

275
00:15:03,683 --> 00:15:04,860
How weird is that?

276
00:15:05,417 --> 00:15:06,956
<i>She's standing very close to me.</i>

277
00:15:08,333 --> 00:15:10,031
<i>Oh, my, she does smell good.</i>

278
00:15:10,423 --> 00:15:12,237
<i>What is that, vanilla?</i>

279
00:15:12,936 --> 00:15:14,730
You know,
where I come from,

280
00:15:14,974 --> 00:15:17,865
if someone comes into your house
at night, you shoot. Okay?

281
00:15:18,019 --> 00:15:19,351
And you don't shoot to wound.

282
00:15:19,501 --> 00:15:21,368
I mean, all right,
my sister shot her husband,

283
00:15:21,561 --> 00:15:23,242
but it was an accident,
they were drunk.

284
00:15:24,255 --> 00:15:25,663
Wait, what was I saying?

285
00:15:26,244 --> 00:15:27,998
<i>She's so chatty.</i>

286
00:15:29,176 --> 00:15:30,526
<i>Maybe my parents are right.</i>|

287
00:15:30,859 --> 00:15:32,865
<i>Maybe I'd be better off
with an Indian girl.</i>

288
00:15:33,055 --> 00:15:34,695
<i>We'd have the same
cultural background</i>

289
00:15:34,888 --> 00:15:38,242
<i>and my wife could sing to my children
the same lullabies my mother sang to me.</i>

290
00:15:38,582 --> 00:15:40,337
It's obvious that they meant well,
but...

291
00:15:40,530 --> 00:15:43,239
I'm having a really rough time.
I broke up with my boyfriend

292
00:15:43,374 --> 00:15:44,918
and...

293
00:15:49,703 --> 00:15:53,108
Just because most of the men I've known
in my life happen to be jerks,

294
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:56,083
doesn't mean I should just
assume Leonard and Sheldon are.

295
00:15:56,342 --> 00:15:57,342
Right?

296
00:15:57,592 --> 00:16:00,306
<i>She asked me a question.
I should probably nod.</i>

297
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:04,280
That's exactly what I thought.

298
00:16:04,479 --> 00:16:06,680
Thank you for listening.
You're a doll.

299
00:16:09,207 --> 00:16:10,500
Turn your pelvis.

300
00:16:24,519 --> 00:16:26,743
Grab a napkin, homie.
You just got served.

301
00:16:30,007 --> 00:16:31,430
It's fine.You win.

302
00:16:33,214 --> 00:16:34,387
What's his problem?

303
00:16:34,871 --> 00:16:37,071
His imaginary girlfriend
broke up with him.

304
00:16:39,071 --> 00:16:40,071
Been there.

305
00:16:43,933 --> 00:16:44,933
Sorry I'm late,

306
00:16:45,176 --> 00:16:47,359
but I was in the hallway,
chatting up Penny.

307
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:51,358
Really? You, Rajesh
Koothrappali, spoke to Penny?

308
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:54,390
Actually, I was less
the chatter than the chat-ee.

309
00:16:55,203 --> 00:16:57,218
What did she say?
Is she still mad at me?

310
00:16:57,423 --> 00:16:58,891
Well, she was upset at first,

311
00:16:59,048 --> 00:17:01,594
but probably because
her sister shot somebody.

312
00:17:03,938 --> 00:17:05,713
But then there was
something about you,

313
00:17:05,906 --> 00:17:07,256
and then she hugged me.

314
00:17:08,003 --> 00:17:10,202
She hugged you?
How'd she hug you?

315
00:17:19,196 --> 00:17:20,646
Is that her perfume I smell?

316
00:17:22,902 --> 00:17:24,499
Intoxicating, isn't it?

317
00:17:41,379 --> 00:17:42,379
Hi.

318
00:17:44,762 --> 00:17:45,762
What's going on?

319
00:17:48,197 --> 00:17:49,412
Here's the thing.

320
00:17:56,064 --> 00:17:58,525
"Just as Oppenheimer came
to regret his contributions

321
00:17:58,698 --> 00:18:00,191
"to the first atomic bomb,

322
00:18:00,428 --> 00:18:02,661
"so too I regret
my participation in what was,

323
00:18:02,866 --> 00:18:04,881
"at the very least,
an error in judgment.

324
00:18:06,527 --> 00:18:08,572
"The hallmark of the
great human experiment

325
00:18:08,798 --> 00:18:10,738
"is the willingness to
recognize one's mistakes.

326
00:18:10,902 --> 00:18:13,234
"Some mistakes, such as
Madam Curie's discovery of radium,

327
00:18:13,369 --> 00:18:15,257
"turned out to have great
scientific potential,

328
00:18:15,397 --> 00:18:18,694
"even though she would later die a slow,
painful death "from radiation poisoning.

329
00:18:21,414 --> 00:18:23,693
Another example, from the
field of Ebola research..."

330
00:18:29,724 --> 00:18:30,724
We're okay.

331
00:18:49,599 --> 00:18:50,901
- Six two inch dowels.
- Check.

332
00:18:51,668 --> 00:18:53,974
- One package Phillips head screws.
- Check.

333
00:18:54,129 --> 00:18:56,096
You guys, seriously,
I grew up on a farm, okay?

334
00:18:56,270 --> 00:18:58,354
I rebuilt a tractor engine
when I was, like, 12.

335
00:18:58,525 --> 00:19:00,873
I think I can put together a cheap,
Swedish media center.

336
00:19:00,993 --> 00:19:03,955
No, please. We insist.
It's the least we can do, considering.

337
00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:05,441
Considering what?

338
00:19:05,603 --> 00:19:07,454
How great this place looks?

339
00:19:08,863 --> 00:19:10,904
- Oh, boy. I was afraid of this.
- What?

340
00:19:11,249 --> 00:19:13,899
These instructions are
a pictographic representation

341
00:19:14,019 --> 00:19:16,930
of the least imaginative way
to assemble these components.

342
00:19:17,065 --> 00:19:19,401
This, right here is why Sweden
has no space program.

343
00:19:21,026 --> 00:19:22,787
Well, it looked
pretty good in the store.

344
00:19:23,001 --> 00:19:25,899
It is an inefficient design.
For example, she has a flat screen TV,

345
00:19:26,053 --> 00:19:28,022
which means all the space
behind it is wasted.

346
00:19:28,244 --> 00:19:30,777
- We could put her stereo back there.
- And control it how?

347
00:19:30,968 --> 00:19:32,308
Run an infrared repeater.

348
00:19:32,443 --> 00:19:34,687
Photo cell here, emitter here,
easy-peasy.

349
00:19:36,130 --> 00:19:37,461
How are you gonna cool it?

350
00:19:37,596 --> 00:19:39,730
- Hey, guys, I got this.
- Hang on, Penny.

351
00:19:40,007 --> 00:19:42,331
How about fans?
Here and here.

352
00:19:42,597 --> 00:19:44,371
Also inefficient,
and might be loud.

353
00:19:44,510 --> 00:19:46,930
How about liquid coolant?
Maybe a little aquarium pump here,

354
00:19:47,123 --> 00:19:48,604
run some quarter-inch PVC...

355
00:19:48,883 --> 00:19:50,624
Guys, this is actually really simple.

356
00:19:51,628 --> 00:19:53,078
Hold on, honey.
Men at work.

357
00:19:55,687 --> 00:19:56,883
The PVC comes down here.

358
00:19:57,018 --> 00:19:59,294
Maybe a little corrugated
sheet metal as a radiator here.

359
00:19:59,430 --> 00:20:02,624
Yeah? Show me where we put a drip tray,
a sluice, and an overflow reservoir.

360
00:20:02,805 --> 00:20:05,777
If water's involved, we're gonna have
to ground the crap out of the thing.

361
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:08,630
It's hot in here. I think
I'll just take off all my clothes.

362
00:20:14,356 --> 00:20:15,358
Oh, I've got it.

363
00:20:17,042 --> 00:20:18,214
What about if we replace

364
00:20:18,407 --> 00:20:22,021
panels A, B and F and crossbar H
with aircraft-grade aluminum?

365
00:20:22,246 --> 00:20:24,117
Right. Then the entire thing
is one heat sink.

366
00:20:24,272 --> 00:20:26,133
You and Sheldon
go to the junkyard and pick up

367
00:20:26,287 --> 00:20:27,638
6 square meters of scrap aluminum?

368
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:29,647
Raj and I
will get the oxyacetylene torch.

369
00:20:29,801 --> 00:20:31,372
- Meet back here in an hour?
- Done.

370
00:20:35,665 --> 00:20:37,497
Okay, this place does look pretty good.

371
00:20:38,555 --> 00:20:40,944
