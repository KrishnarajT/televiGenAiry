1
00:00:06,997 --> 00:00:09,286
Okay, if no one else will say it,
I will.

2
00:00:09,574 --> 00:00:11,349
We really suck at paintball.

3
00:00:13,008 --> 00:00:14,802
That was absolutely humiliating.

4
00:00:14,976 --> 00:00:17,600
Come on, some battles you win,
some battles you lose.

5
00:00:17,966 --> 00:00:22,544
Yes, but you don't have to lose
to Kyle Burnsteen's Bar Mitzva party.

6
00:00:24,013 --> 00:00:25,421
I think we have to acknowlegde,

7
00:00:25,556 --> 00:00:28,826
those was some fairly savage
preadolescent Jews.

8
00:00:31,357 --> 00:00:33,788
No, we were annihilated
by our own incompetence

9
00:00:33,970 --> 00:00:36,266
and the inability
of some people to follow

10
00:00:36,594 --> 00:00:38,579
- the chain of command.
- Sheldon, let it go!

11
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:42,213
No, I want to talk about the fact
that Wolowitz shot me in the back.

12
00:00:43,719 --> 00:00:47,076
I shot you for a good reason.
You were leading us into disaster.

13
00:00:48,178 --> 00:00:50,325
I was giving clear,
concise orders.

14
00:00:50,796 --> 00:00:54,192
You hid behind a tree yelling,
"Get the kid in the yarmulke!

15
00:00:55,135 --> 00:00:56,272
Oh, hey, guys.

16
00:00:57,207 --> 00:00:58,286
Morning, ma'am.

17
00:00:59,385 --> 00:01:01,295
So, how was paintball?
Did you have fun?

18
00:01:01,756 --> 00:01:04,746
Sure, if you consider being fragged
by your own troops fun.

19
00:01:06,251 --> 00:01:09,306
You clear space on your calendar--
there will be an inquiry.

20
00:01:10,905 --> 00:01:12,294
I'm having a party on Saturday,

21
00:01:12,449 --> 00:01:14,262
so if you are around,
you should come on by.

22
00:01:14,471 --> 00:01:15,552
A party?
Yeah.

23
00:01:15,770 --> 00:01:17,736
A... "boy-girl" party?

24
00:01:20,067 --> 00:01:21,418
Well, there will be boys

25
00:01:21,611 --> 00:01:23,714
and there will be girls
and it is a party, so...

26
00:01:24,053 --> 00:01:26,967
It'll be a bunch of my friends.
We'll have some beer, a little dancing.

27
00:01:27,285 --> 00:01:29,359
- Dancing?
- Yeah, I don't know, Penny...

28
00:01:29,507 --> 00:01:32,182
- The thing is, we're not...
- No, we're really more of a...

29
00:01:34,045 --> 00:01:35,765
But thanks.
Thanks for thinking of us.

30
00:01:36,086 --> 00:01:37,764
Are you sure?
Come on, it's Halloween.

31
00:01:38,001 --> 00:01:39,203
A Halloween party?

32
00:01:39,493 --> 00:01:40,805
As in... costumes?

33
00:01:41,067 --> 00:01:42,302
Well, yeah.

34
00:01:51,259 --> 00:01:52,455
Is there a theme?

35
00:01:53,078 --> 00:01:54,332
Yeah, Halloween.

36
00:01:55,277 --> 00:01:57,939
Yes, but are the costumes
random, or genre-specific?

37
00:01:58,788 --> 00:02:00,891
As usual, I'm not following.

38
00:02:01,575 --> 00:02:05,270
He's asking if we can come as anyone
from science fiction, fantasy...

39
00:02:05,537 --> 00:02:06,811
- Sure.
- Comic books?

40
00:02:07,115 --> 00:02:08,043
Fine.
Anime?

41
00:02:08,255 --> 00:02:09,409
Of course.
TV, film,

42
00:02:09,586 --> 00:02:11,685
D- and-D, manga, Greek gods,
Roman gods, Norse gods--

43
00:02:11,995 --> 00:02:13,518
Anything you want!
Okay?

44
00:02:13,811 --> 00:02:15,625
Any costume you want.

45
00:02:17,007 --> 00:02:18,007
Bye.

46
00:02:20,301 --> 00:02:22,404
Gentlemen,
to the sewing machines.

47
00:02:42,259 --> 00:02:44,477
Synchro: Sixe

48
00:02:48,212 --> 00:02:49,271
I'll get it.

49
00:03:04,688 --> 00:03:05,902
Oh, no.

50
00:03:09,995 --> 00:03:12,561
Make way
for the fastest man alive!

51
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:17,600
See, this is why I wanted
to have a costume meeting.

52
00:03:17,889 --> 00:03:20,099
We all have other costumes:
We can change.

53
00:03:20,743 --> 00:03:23,286
Or we could walk right
behind each other all night

54
00:03:23,525 --> 00:03:25,840
and look like one person going
really fast.

55
00:03:33,418 --> 00:03:34,728
No, no, no.

56
00:03:34,865 --> 00:03:37,829
It's a boy-girl party,
this flash runs solo.

57
00:03:39,461 --> 00:03:43,084
How about this? Nobody gets
to be The Flash. We all change. Agreed?

58
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:45,720
Agreed.

59
00:03:47,989 --> 00:03:48,989
I call Frodo!

60
00:03:49,337 --> 00:03:50,337
Damn!

61
00:04:01,213 --> 00:04:04,617
Sorry I'm late, but my hammer
got stuck in the door on the bus.

62
00:04:05,403 --> 00:04:06,483
You went with Thor?

63
00:04:06,685 --> 00:04:09,579
What, just because I'm Indian
I can't be a Norse god?

64
00:04:10,429 --> 00:04:13,003
"No, no,
Raj has to be an Indian god."

65
00:04:13,538 --> 00:04:14,538
That's racism.

66
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:16,191
I mean look at Wolowitz.

67
00:04:16,384 --> 00:04:18,546
He's not English,
but he's dressed like Peter Pan.

68
00:04:20,297 --> 00:04:21,904
Sheldon is neither
sound nor light,

69
00:04:22,209 --> 00:04:23,914
but he's obviously
the Doppler effect.

70
00:04:28,634 --> 00:04:29,753
I'm not Peter Pan.

71
00:04:30,005 --> 00:04:31,219
I'm Robin Hood.

72
00:04:31,722 --> 00:04:33,609
Really?
Because I sawPeter Pan,

73
00:04:33,761 --> 00:04:35,787
and you're dressed
exactly like Cathy Rigby.

74
00:04:37,416 --> 00:04:40,175
She was a little bigger than you,
but it's basically the same look, man.

75
00:04:42,187 --> 00:04:45,083
There's something I want to talk
to you about before we go to the party.

76
00:04:45,237 --> 00:04:46,723
I don't care if anybody gets it.

77
00:04:46,974 --> 00:04:48,922
I'm going as the Doppler effect.

78
00:04:49,952 --> 00:04:52,441
- No, it's not that.
- If I have to, I can demonstrate.

79
00:04:57,268 --> 00:04:58,268
Terrific.

80
00:05:00,224 --> 00:05:03,191
This party is my first chance
for Penny to see me

81
00:05:03,484 --> 00:05:05,738
in the context of her social group,

82
00:05:06,124 --> 00:05:08,535
and I need you not
to embarrass me tonight.

83
00:05:09,986 --> 00:05:11,853
What exactly do you mean
by embarrass you?

84
00:05:12,921 --> 00:05:14,839
For example, tonight,

85
00:05:15,013 --> 00:05:17,810
no one needs to know
that my middle name is Leakey.

86
00:05:18,331 --> 00:05:20,312
But there's nothing
embarrassing about that.

87
00:05:20,505 --> 00:05:23,529
Your father worked with Louis Leakey,
a great anthropologist.

88
00:05:23,722 --> 00:05:25,590
It had nothing to do
with your bed-wetting.

89
00:05:27,911 --> 00:05:30,878
All I'm saying is that this party
is the perfect opportunity

90
00:05:31,071 --> 00:05:33,944
for Penny to see me
as a member of her peer group,

91
00:05:34,178 --> 00:05:37,257
a potential close friend,
and perhaps more,

92
00:05:38,884 --> 00:05:40,762
and I don't want to look like a dork.

93
00:05:51,668 --> 00:05:52,880
Just a heads up, fellas.

94
00:05:53,035 --> 00:05:55,562
If anyone gets lucky, I've got
a dozen condoms in my quiver.

95
00:05:58,725 --> 00:05:59,729
Hey, guys.

96
00:05:59,941 --> 00:06:01,127
Hey. Sorry we're late.

97
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:03,443
Late?
It's 7:05.

98
00:06:03,734 --> 00:06:05,316
You said the party starts at 7:00.

99
00:06:06,168 --> 00:06:08,059
Yeah, I mean,
when you start a party at 7:00,

100
00:06:08,252 --> 00:06:10,464
no one shows up at,
you know, 7:00.

101
00:06:12,254 --> 00:06:13,391
It's 7:05.

102
00:06:15,008 --> 00:06:16,395
Yes. Yes, it is.

103
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:18,742
Okay. Well, um, come on in.

104
00:06:26,929 --> 00:06:29,217
So, what, are all the girls
in the bathroom?

105
00:06:29,826 --> 00:06:31,991
Probably,
but in their own homes.

106
00:06:33,829 --> 00:06:36,279
So, what time does
the costume parade start?

107
00:06:37,138 --> 00:06:38,236
The parade?

108
00:06:38,559 --> 00:06:41,434
Yeah, so the judges can give out
the prizes for best costume.

109
00:06:41,603 --> 00:06:43,623
You know, most frightening,
most authentic,

110
00:06:44,009 --> 00:06:46,758
most accurate visualization
of a scientific principal.

111
00:06:48,970 --> 00:06:50,577
Oh, Sheldon, I'm sorry,

112
00:06:50,789 --> 00:06:54,281
but there aren't going to be any parades
or judges or prizes.

113
00:06:55,875 --> 00:06:57,828
This party is just going to suck.

114
00:06:58,833 --> 00:07:00,497
No!
Come on, it's going to be fun,

115
00:07:00,661 --> 00:07:02,629
and you all look great.
I mean, look at you, Thor,

116
00:07:02,897 --> 00:07:03,804
and, oh,

117
00:07:04,054 --> 00:07:06,008
Peter Pan.
That's so cute.

118
00:07:06,895 --> 00:07:09,679
- Actually, he's Robin Hood.
- I'm Peter Pan.

119
00:07:10,850 --> 00:07:13,763
And I got a handful of pixie dust
with your name on it.

120
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:16,860
No, you don't.

121
00:07:19,530 --> 00:07:20,996
What's Sheldon supposed to be?

122
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,279
He's the Doppler effect.

123
00:07:23,543 --> 00:07:26,141
Yes. It's the apparent change
in the frequency of a wave

124
00:07:26,291 --> 00:07:30,154
caused by relative motion between
the source of the wave and the observer.

125
00:07:32,098 --> 00:07:35,133
Oh, sure, I see it now.
The Doppler effect.

126
00:07:35,767 --> 00:07:37,079
All right, I got to shower.

127
00:07:37,214 --> 00:07:39,269
You guys...
make yourselves comfortable.

128
00:07:42,686 --> 00:07:44,306
See?
People get it.

129
00:07:58,690 --> 00:08:01,245
By Odin's beard,
this is good Chex mix.

130
00:08:02,442 --> 00:08:03,829
No, thanks. Peanuts.

131
00:08:04,023 --> 00:08:06,435
I can't afford to swell up
in these tights.

132
00:08:07,064 --> 00:08:08,316
I'm confused.

133
00:08:08,511 --> 00:08:11,192
If there's no costume parade,
what are we doing here?

134
00:08:12,113 --> 00:08:14,937
We're socializing,
meeting new people.

135
00:08:15,426 --> 00:08:16,736
Telepathically?

136
00:08:18,215 --> 00:08:20,202
Oh, hey, when
did you get here?

137
00:08:21,512 --> 00:08:24,576
Penny is wearing the worst
Catwoman costume I've ever seen.

138
00:08:24,858 --> 00:08:26,595
And that includes Halle Berry's.

139
00:08:26,873 --> 00:08:29,664
She's not Catwoman.
She's just a generic cat.

140
00:08:29,872 --> 00:08:31,757
And that's the kind of sloppy costuming

141
00:08:31,969 --> 00:08:34,639
which results from a lack
of rules and competion.

142
00:08:37,385 --> 00:08:38,973
Hey, guys, check out the sexy nurse.

143
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:43,893
I believe it's time for me
to turn my head and cough.

144
00:08:45,991 --> 00:08:47,070
What is your move?

145
00:08:47,224 --> 00:08:49,207
I'm going to use
the mirror technique.

146
00:08:49,537 --> 00:08:51,505
She brushes her hair back,
I brush my hair back...

147
00:08:51,659 --> 00:08:53,685
She shrugs, I shrug.
Subconsciously she's thinking,

148
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:55,402
"We're in sync.
We belong together."

149
00:08:56,210 --> 00:08:58,024
Where do you get this stuff?

150
00:08:58,609 --> 00:09:01,355
You know, psychology journals,
Internet research,

151
00:09:01,564 --> 00:09:04,952
and there's this great show on VH-1
about how to pick up girls.

152
00:09:08,016 --> 00:09:09,927
If only I had his confidence.

153
00:09:10,177 --> 00:09:12,290
I have such difficulty
speaking to women,

154
00:09:12,582 --> 00:09:13,913
or around women...

155
00:09:14,185 --> 00:09:16,368
or at times even effeminate men.

156
00:09:18,444 --> 00:09:19,987
If that's a working stethoscope,

157
00:09:20,296 --> 00:09:22,747
maybe you'd like to hear
my heart skip a beat?

158
00:09:23,802 --> 00:09:24,842
No, thanks.

159
00:09:25,161 --> 00:09:28,191
No, seriously, you can.
I have transient idiopathic arrhythmia.

160
00:09:35,372 --> 00:09:37,926
I want to get to know Penny's friends,
I just...

161
00:09:38,215 --> 00:09:40,646
I don't know
how to talk to these people.

162
00:09:40,873 --> 00:09:43,158
Well, I actually might
be able to help.

163
00:09:44,039 --> 00:09:45,043
How so?

164
00:09:45,242 --> 00:09:47,364
Like Jane Goodall
observing the apes,

165
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:51,240
I initially saw their interactions
as confusing and unstructured.

166
00:09:51,601 --> 00:09:52,788
But patterns emerge.

167
00:09:52,934 --> 00:09:55,867
They have their own
language, if you will.

168
00:09:57,097 --> 00:09:58,137
Go on.

169
00:09:59,173 --> 00:10:02,158
It seems that the newcomer
approaches the existing group

170
00:10:02,312 --> 00:10:04,659
with the greeting,
"How wasted am I?"

171
00:10:04,987 --> 00:10:07,881
Which is met with an
approving chorus of "Dude."

172
00:10:09,455 --> 00:10:10,514
Then what happens?

173
00:10:10,873 --> 00:10:12,263
That's as far as I've gotten.

174
00:10:13,872 --> 00:10:15,221
This is ridiculous.

175
00:10:15,379 --> 00:10:17,218
- I'm jumping in.
- Good luck.

176
00:10:17,624 --> 00:10:18,896
No, you're coming with me.

177
00:10:19,156 --> 00:10:20,719
Oh, I hardly think so.

178
00:10:21,277 --> 00:10:22,222
Come on.

179
00:10:22,862 --> 00:10:24,579
Aren't you afraid
I'll embarrass you?

180
00:10:24,733 --> 00:10:26,855
Yes; but I need a wing man.

181
00:10:27,290 --> 00:10:30,238
All right, but if we're
going to use flight metaphors,

182
00:10:30,411 --> 00:10:34,051
I'm much more suited to being the guy
from the FAA analyzing wreckage.

183
00:10:40,218 --> 00:10:41,703
So what are you
supposed to be?

184
00:10:42,167 --> 00:10:44,828
Me?
I'll give you a hint.

185
00:10:48,774 --> 00:10:49,970
A choo-choo train?

186
00:10:50,481 --> 00:10:51,481
Close!

187
00:10:54,489 --> 00:10:56,267
A brain damaged choo-choo train?

188
00:10:58,990 --> 00:11:01,342
How wasted am I?

189
00:11:11,655 --> 00:11:12,792
I still don't get it.

190
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:14,645
I'm the Doppler effect.

191
00:11:15,115 --> 00:11:17,045
If that's some sort
of learning disability,

192
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,608
I think it's very insensitive.

193
00:11:21,167 --> 00:11:23,437
Why don't you just tell people
you're a zebra?

194
00:11:24,474 --> 00:11:27,363
Why don't you just tell people
you're one of the seven dwarves?

195
00:11:27,652 --> 00:11:28,674
Because I'm Frodo.

196
00:11:28,934 --> 00:11:30,902
Yes, well,
I'm the Doppler effect.

197
00:11:32,932 --> 00:11:34,609
- Oh, no.
- What?

198
00:11:35,343 --> 00:11:36,887
That's Penny's ex-boyfriend.

199
00:11:37,290 --> 00:11:38,904
What do you suppose
he's doing here?

200
00:11:39,192 --> 00:11:41,885
Besides disrupting the
local gravity field.

201
00:11:43,402 --> 00:11:45,926
If he were any bigger,
he'd have moons orbiting him.

202
00:11:46,351 --> 00:11:47,410
Oh, snap.

203
00:11:49,258 --> 00:11:51,191
So, I guess we'll be leaving now.

204
00:11:51,512 --> 00:11:52,880
Why should we leave?

205
00:11:53,362 --> 00:11:56,849
For all we know he crashed the party
and Penny doesn't even want him here.

206
00:11:58,770 --> 00:12:00,527
You have a backup hypothesis?

207
00:12:01,322 --> 00:12:02,983
Maybe they want to be friends.

208
00:12:03,736 --> 00:12:05,338
Or maybe she wants
to be friends

209
00:12:05,588 --> 00:12:07,421
and he wants
something more.

210
00:12:07,806 --> 00:12:09,716
Then he and I are on equal ground.

211
00:12:09,975 --> 00:12:12,368
Yes, but you're much
closer to it than he is.

212
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,778
Look, if this was 1,500 years ago,

213
00:12:16,954 --> 00:12:18,638
by virtue of his size and strength,

214
00:12:18,823 --> 00:12:21,176
Kurt would be entitled to his
choice of female partners.

215
00:12:21,369 --> 00:12:24,644
And male partners, animal partners,
large primordial eggplants--

216
00:12:24,798 --> 00:12:27,152
pretty much whatever
tickled his fancy.

217
00:12:27,823 --> 00:12:30,599
Yes, but our society has
undergone a paradigm shift.

218
00:12:30,730 --> 00:12:32,180
In the Information Age,

219
00:12:32,647 --> 00:12:34,692
you and I are the alpha males.

220
00:12:35,130 --> 00:12:37,413
- We shouldn't have to back down.
- True.

221
00:12:37,784 --> 00:12:40,349
Why don't you text him that
and see if he backs down?

222
00:12:41,646 --> 00:12:42,646
5No.

223
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:46,829
I'm going to assert
my dominance face-to-face.

224
00:12:47,549 --> 00:12:49,789
Face-to-face? Are you going
to wait for him to sit down,

225
00:12:49,962 --> 00:12:52,026
or are you going to stand
on the coffee table?

226
00:12:54,007 --> 00:12:55,511
Hello, Penny.
Hello, Kurt.

227
00:12:55,864 --> 00:12:57,544
Hey, guys, are you
having a good time?

228
00:12:57,948 --> 00:12:59,472
Given the reaction to my costume,

229
00:12:59,627 --> 00:13:02,520
this party is a scathing indictment
of the American education system.

230
00:13:03,974 --> 00:13:05,402
What, you're a zebra, right?

231
00:13:06,681 --> 00:13:08,323
Yet another child left behind.

232
00:13:09,715 --> 00:13:11,278
What are you supposed to be, an elf?

233
00:13:11,984 --> 00:13:13,179
No, I'm a hobbit.

234
00:13:13,478 --> 00:13:14,616
What's the difference?

235
00:13:15,039 --> 00:13:18,003
A hobbit is a mortal halfling
inhabitant of Middle Earth,

236
00:13:18,196 --> 00:13:21,086
whereas an elf is an immortal,
tall warrior.

237
00:13:21,602 --> 00:13:24,046
So why the hell would you
want to be a hobbit?

238
00:13:24,752 --> 00:13:26,670
Because he's neither
tall nor immortal

239
00:13:26,824 --> 00:13:28,637
and none of us could be The Flash.

240
00:13:29,914 --> 00:13:32,696
Well, whatever.
Why don't you go hop off on a quest?

241
00:13:32,870 --> 00:13:34,162
I'm talking to Penny here.

242
00:13:34,309 --> 00:13:36,224
I think we're all
talking to Penny here.

243
00:13:36,436 --> 00:13:37,536
I'm not. No offense.

244
00:13:38,913 --> 00:13:40,418
Okay, maybe you didn't hear me.

245
00:13:40,624 --> 00:13:42,712
- Go away.
- All right, Kurt, be nice.

246
00:13:43,192 --> 00:13:44,618
Oh, I am being nice.

247
00:13:45,697 --> 00:13:46,951
Right, little buddy?

248
00:13:50,031 --> 00:13:53,600
I understand your impulse
to try to physically intimidate me.

249
00:13:53,895 --> 00:13:56,388
I mean, you can't compete
with me on an intellectual level

250
00:13:56,543 --> 00:13:58,896
so you're driven
to animalistic puffery.

251
00:13:59,417 --> 00:14:01,288
You calling me a puffy animal?

252
00:14:01,921 --> 00:14:03,807
Of course not.
No, he's not.

253
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:05,273
You're not, right, Leonard?

254
00:14:06,274 --> 00:14:08,339
No, I said "animalistic."

255
00:14:08,827 --> 00:14:10,582
Of course
we're all animals, but,

256
00:14:10,875 --> 00:14:13,834
some of us have climbed a little higher
on the evolutionary tree.

257
00:14:14,046 --> 00:14:15,956
If he understands that,
you're in trouble.

258
00:14:16,349 --> 00:14:17,989
So, what, I'm unevolved?

259
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:19,478
You're in trouble.

260
00:14:20,565 --> 00:14:23,806
You use a lot of big words
for such a little dwarf.

261
00:14:24,009 --> 00:14:25,404
Okay, Kurt, please.

262
00:14:25,983 --> 00:14:27,816
It's okay.
I can handle this.

263
00:14:28,665 --> 00:14:29,860
I am not a dwarf,

264
00:14:30,317 --> 00:14:31,492
I'm a hobbit.

265
00:14:32,025 --> 00:14:33,009
A hobbit.

266
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:35,732
Are misfiring neurons
in your hippocampus preventing

267
00:14:35,906 --> 00:14:38,182
the conversion from short-term
to long-term memory?

268
00:14:41,126 --> 00:14:42,969
Okay, now you're starting
to make me mad.

269
00:14:44,385 --> 00:14:47,262
A homo habilis discovering his
opposable thumbs says what?

270
00:14:49,096 --> 00:14:50,096
What?

271
00:14:54,970 --> 00:14:56,320
I think I've made my point.

272
00:14:56,594 --> 00:14:59,546
Yeah? How about I make a point
out of your pointy little head?

273
00:14:59,958 --> 00:15:02,389
Let me remind you,
while my moral support is absolute,

274
00:15:02,558 --> 00:15:05,434
in a physical confrontation,
I will be less than useless.

275
00:15:05,716 --> 00:15:07,629
There's not going
to be a confrontation.

276
00:15:07,957 --> 00:15:11,449
In fact, I doubt if he can
even spell "confrontation."

277
00:15:14,081 --> 00:15:15,565
C- O-N...

278
00:15:16,992 --> 00:15:18,188
frontation!

279
00:15:19,244 --> 00:15:21,038
Kurt, put him down this instant!

280
00:15:21,257 --> 00:15:22,255
He started it!

281
00:15:22,455 --> 00:15:24,290
I don't care. I'm finishing it.
Put him down!

282
00:15:25,464 --> 00:15:26,464
Fine.

283
00:15:28,570 --> 00:15:30,485
You're one lucky little leprechaun.

284
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:33,637
He's a hobbit!

285
00:15:34,375 --> 00:15:35,589
I got your back.

286
00:15:37,129 --> 00:15:38,129
Are you okay?

287
00:15:38,432 --> 00:15:39,551
Yeah, I'm fine.

288
00:15:43,048 --> 00:15:44,861
It's a good party,
thanks for having us.

289
00:15:45,013 --> 00:15:46,619
It's just getting a little late, so...

290
00:15:48,618 --> 00:15:50,239
All right, thank you for coming.

291
00:15:53,648 --> 00:15:54,727
Happy Halloween.

292
00:15:58,606 --> 00:15:59,822
If it's any consolation,

293
00:15:59,969 --> 00:16:02,967
I thought that homo habilis line
really put him in his place.

294
00:16:12,553 --> 00:16:13,553
What's that?

295
00:16:13,941 --> 00:16:14,954
Tea.

296
00:16:15,889 --> 00:16:17,104
When people are upset,

297
00:16:17,259 --> 00:16:20,133
the cultural convention is
to bring them hot beverages.

298
00:16:26,929 --> 00:16:27,929
There, there.

299
00:16:31,255 --> 00:16:32,528
You want to talk about it?

300
00:16:32,837 --> 00:16:33,956
- No.
- Good.

301
00:16:35,592 --> 00:16:37,643
"There, there"
was really all I had.

302
00:16:39,304 --> 00:16:41,682
- Good night, Sheldon.
- Good night, Leonard.

303
00:16:51,368 --> 00:16:53,161
I just wanted to make sure
you were okay.

304
00:16:53,355 --> 00:16:54,455
I'm fine.

305
00:16:56,528 --> 00:16:58,867
I am so sorry about
what happened.

306
00:16:59,127 --> 00:17:00,572
It's not your fault.

307
00:17:00,831 --> 00:17:01,831
Yes, it is.

308
00:17:01,985 --> 00:17:05,096
That's why I broke up with him.
He always does stuff like that.

309
00:17:06,713 --> 00:17:08,141
So why was he at your party?

310
00:17:12,119 --> 00:17:13,706
I ran into him last week

311
00:17:14,056 --> 00:17:17,348
and he was just all apologetic
about how he's changed.

312
00:17:17,668 --> 00:17:19,828
And he was just
going on and on and...

313
00:17:20,056 --> 00:17:23,310
I believed him and I'm an idiot
because I always believe guys like that.

314
00:17:24,770 --> 00:17:27,124
I can't go back to my
party because he's there.

315
00:17:27,358 --> 00:17:29,091
You don't want to hear this
and I'm upset

316
00:17:29,246 --> 00:17:31,252
and I'm really drunk
and I just want to...

317
00:17:40,663 --> 00:17:41,800
There, there.

318
00:17:45,954 --> 00:17:47,478
God, what is wrong with me?

319
00:17:47,661 --> 00:17:49,396
Nothing, you're perfect.

320
00:17:49,810 --> 00:17:51,919
- I'm not perfect.
- Yes, you are.

321
00:17:54,968 --> 00:17:56,765
You really think so, don't you?

322
00:18:14,658 --> 00:18:16,692
How much have you
had to drink tonight?

323
00:18:19,425 --> 00:18:21,393
Just... a lot.

324
00:18:23,368 --> 00:18:25,553
Are you sure that your being drunk

325
00:18:25,768 --> 00:18:27,389
and your being angry with Kurt

326
00:18:27,644 --> 00:18:30,017
doesn't have something to do
with what's going on here?

327
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:32,893
It might.

328
00:18:36,192 --> 00:18:37,657
Boy, you're really smart.

329
00:18:38,108 --> 00:18:39,767
Yeah, I'm a frickin' genius.

330
00:18:45,248 --> 00:18:46,887
Leonard, you are so great.

331
00:18:47,356 --> 00:18:49,114
Why can't all guys be like you?

332
00:18:50,359 --> 00:18:53,853
Because if all guys were like me,
the human race couldn't survive.

333
00:18:58,639 --> 00:18:59,835
I should probably go.

334
00:19:00,255 --> 00:19:01,255
Probably.

335
00:19:10,733 --> 00:19:11,736
Thank you.

336
00:19:22,791 --> 00:19:24,861
That's right,
you saw what you saw.

337
00:19:27,148 --> 00:19:29,077
That's how we roll in the Shire.

338
00:19:36,343 --> 00:19:37,343
Coming.

339
00:19:42,696 --> 00:19:44,474
Hey, have you seen Koothrappali?

340
00:19:45,398 --> 00:19:46,728
He's not here.

341
00:19:47,106 --> 00:19:49,251
Maybe the Avengers summoned him.

342
00:19:50,909 --> 00:19:53,537
He's not the Marvel Comics Thor,
he's the original Norse god.

343
00:19:53,968 --> 00:19:55,843
Thank you for the clarification.

344
00:19:56,464 --> 00:19:59,235
- I'm supposed to give him a ride home.
- I'm sure he'll be fine.

345
00:19:59,423 --> 00:20:00,849
He has his hammer.

346
00:20:08,887 --> 00:20:11,943
I have to say,
you are an amazing man.

347
00:20:13,143 --> 00:20:15,634
You're gentle,
and passionate.

348
00:20:16,656 --> 00:20:17,851
And, my God,

349
00:20:18,304 --> 00:20:20,600
you are such a good listener.
