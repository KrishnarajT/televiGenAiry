1
00:00:00,428 --> 00:00:03,351
All right!
I'm moving my infantry division.

2
00:00:03,574 --> 00:00:06,686
Augmented by bataillon of orcs
from Lord of the Rings.

3
00:00:06,897 --> 00:00:08,494
We flank the Tennessee volunteers

4
00:00:08,682 --> 00:00:11,582
and the North, once again,
wins the battle of Gettysburg.

5
00:00:11,969 --> 00:00:13,108
Not so fast!

6
00:00:13,273 --> 00:00:15,421
Remember, the South still has
two infantry divisions,

7
00:00:15,656 --> 00:00:17,335
plus Superman and Godzilla.

8
00:00:17,927 --> 00:00:21,298
No, orcs are magic. Superman
is vulnerable to magic.

9
00:00:21,384 --> 00:00:25,516
Not to mention you already lost Godzilla
to the Illinois cavalry and Hulk.

10
00:00:26,129 --> 00:00:30,094
Why don't you just have Robert E. Lee
charge the line with Shiva and Ganesh?

11
00:00:30,319 --> 00:00:32,332
- You guys ready to order?
- Hang on, honey.

12
00:00:32,509 --> 00:00:33,730
Shiva and Ganesh,

13
00:00:33,977 --> 00:00:36,280
the Hindu gods,
against the entire Union army?

14
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:37,400
And orcs.

15
00:00:38,313 --> 00:00:39,452
I'll be back.

16
00:00:39,830 --> 00:00:40,847
Excuse me.

17
00:00:40,967 --> 00:00:43,694
Ganesh is the Remover of Obstacles
and Shiva is the Destroyer.

18
00:00:43,870 --> 00:00:46,488
When the smoke clears,
Abraham Lincoln will be speaking Hindi

19
00:00:46,641 --> 00:00:48,009
and drinking mint juleps.

20
00:00:48,676 --> 00:00:51,929
My boss says you have to either order
or leave and never come back.

21
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:55,761
What do you recommend for someone
who worked up a man-sized appetite

22
00:00:55,965 --> 00:00:58,055
from a morning of weight training
and cardio funk?

23
00:00:58,234 --> 00:00:59,234
A shower.

24
00:01:00,337 --> 00:01:02,413
I'll take the Heart Smart platter.

25
00:01:03,227 --> 00:01:04,984
All right, thank you,
and Sheldon?

26
00:01:05,325 --> 00:01:07,361
We don't eat here.
I don't know what's good.

27
00:01:07,611 --> 00:01:10,138
- It's all good.
- Statistically unlikely.

28
00:01:11,267 --> 00:01:13,248
Just get a hamburger.
You like hamburgers.

29
00:01:13,368 --> 00:01:15,295
I like hamburgers
where we usually have them.

30
00:01:15,415 --> 00:01:17,765
You can't make the assumption
that I'll like them here.

31
00:01:18,607 --> 00:01:19,629
I'm sorry.

32
00:01:19,885 --> 00:01:21,781
- Give him a hamburger.
- Which one?

33
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:23,801
The Classic Burger,
the Ranch House Burger,

34
00:01:23,938 --> 00:01:25,752
the Barbecue Burger,
or the Kobe Burger?

35
00:01:25,931 --> 00:01:27,669
Can't we just go to Big Boy?

36
00:01:27,976 --> 00:01:30,526
They only have one burger...
the Big Boy.

37
00:01:31,037 --> 00:01:32,668
The Barbecue Burger's like the Big Boy.

38
00:01:32,823 --> 00:01:35,232
Excuse me, in a world
that already includes a Big Boy,

39
00:01:35,397 --> 00:01:37,499
why would I settle for
something like a Big Boy?

40
00:01:37,743 --> 00:01:39,633
Because you're not at Big Boy!

41
00:01:41,037 --> 00:01:43,631
- Fine, I'll have the Barbecue Burger.
- Make it two.

42
00:01:43,751 --> 00:01:45,983
Waitresses don't yell at you
at Big Boy.

43
00:01:47,101 --> 00:01:48,760
Hey, Leonard.
Hi, guys.

44
00:01:48,934 --> 00:01:50,002
Hi, Leslie.

45
00:01:50,122 --> 00:01:51,420
I didn't know you ate here.

46
00:01:51,556 --> 00:01:53,672
We don't.
This is a disturbing aberration.

47
00:01:54,019 --> 00:01:55,163
Leslie, this is Penny.

48
00:01:55,283 --> 00:01:57,183
She lives across the hall
from Sheldon and me.

49
00:01:57,316 --> 00:01:59,805
And walks in quiet beauty
like the night.

50
00:02:00,858 --> 00:02:02,750
Howard, I've asked you not to do that.

51
00:02:03,999 --> 00:02:06,295
Leslie and I do research together
at the university.

52
00:02:07,077 --> 00:02:08,659
Wow, a girl scientist.

53
00:02:08,995 --> 00:02:11,054
Yep, come for the breasts,
stay for the brains.

54
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:13,732
Glad I ran into you.

55
00:02:13,826 --> 00:02:16,281
The Physics Department string quartet
needs a new cellist.

56
00:02:16,435 --> 00:02:17,791
What happened to Elliot Wong?

57
00:02:17,943 --> 00:02:19,940
He switched over
to high-energy radiation research,

58
00:02:20,094 --> 00:02:21,864
had a little mishap,
and now the other guys

59
00:02:21,999 --> 00:02:23,697
are uncomfortable sitting next to him.

60
00:02:24,267 --> 00:02:26,216
- You're in?
- Yeah, sure, why not?

61
00:02:26,586 --> 00:02:28,706
Great, we rehearse
on Tuesdays at your place.

62
00:02:28,826 --> 00:02:29,866
Why at my place?

63
00:02:30,039 --> 00:02:33,322
Department of Energy said
our regular space is kind of a hot zone.

64
00:02:34,135 --> 00:02:35,946
- Nice meeting you.
- Yeah, you, too.

65
00:02:36,979 --> 00:02:38,523
I didn't know you played the cello.

66
00:02:38,696 --> 00:02:40,931
Yeah, my parents felt
that naming me Leonard

67
00:02:41,051 --> 00:02:43,249
and putting me
in Advanced Placement classes

68
00:02:43,404 --> 00:02:45,334
wasn't getting me beaten up enough.

69
00:02:46,125 --> 00:02:48,962
If you're into music,
I happen to be a human beatbox.

70
00:02:49,236 --> 00:02:50,085
Really?

71
00:02:57,007 --> 00:02:58,956
I'm actually not that into music.

72
00:02:59,985 --> 00:03:01,240
Your friend's really cute.

73
00:03:01,433 --> 00:03:02,912
Anything going on with you two?

74
00:03:03,632 --> 00:03:04,632
Leslie?

75
00:03:04,786 --> 00:03:05,786
No, no.

76
00:03:06,261 --> 00:03:08,229
- What, are you kidding?
- He asked her out once.

77
00:03:08,383 --> 00:03:10,109
It was an embarrassing failure.

78
00:03:10,641 --> 00:03:12,184
- Thank you, Sheldon.
- I'm sorry.

79
00:03:12,367 --> 00:03:13,821
Was that supposed to be a secret?

80
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:17,158
That's too bad.
You guys'd make a cute couple.

81
00:03:19,514 --> 00:03:20,514
Oh, dear.

82
00:03:20,862 --> 00:03:22,811
- What's the matter?
- She didn't take my order.

83
00:03:22,984 --> 00:03:25,958
How can she take your order
when you're too neurotic to talk to her?

84
00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:29,604
Nevertheless,
this will be reflected in her tip.

85
00:03:32,988 --> 00:03:35,284
What did Penny mean,
"You'd make a cute couple?"

86
00:03:35,973 --> 00:03:37,751
I assume she meant
the two of you together

87
00:03:37,905 --> 00:03:41,114
would constitute a couple
that others might consider cute.

88
00:03:42,986 --> 00:03:44,971
An alternate and somewhat
less likely interpretation

89
00:03:45,164 --> 00:03:47,168
is that you could manufacture one.

90
00:03:48,733 --> 00:03:51,427
As in, "Look, Leonard and Leslie
made Mr. and Mrs. Goldfarb.

91
00:03:51,521 --> 00:03:52,713
Aren't they adorable?"

92
00:03:54,038 --> 00:03:56,127
If Penny didn't know
that Leslie had turned me down,

93
00:03:56,282 --> 00:03:57,748
then it would unambiguously mean

94
00:03:57,883 --> 00:04:00,678
that she, Penny, thought
I should ask her, Leslie, out,

95
00:04:00,851 --> 00:04:03,823
indicating that she had no interest
in me asking her, Penny, out.

96
00:04:03,977 --> 00:04:06,369
But, because she did know
that I had asked Leslie out

97
00:04:06,593 --> 00:04:09,262
and that she, Leslie,
had turned me down, then she, Penny,

98
00:04:09,397 --> 00:04:11,269
could be offering consolation.

99
00:04:13,258 --> 00:04:16,152
"That's too bad,
you would have made a cute couple,"

100
00:04:16,337 --> 00:04:19,714
but while thinking: "Good,
Leonard remains available."

101
00:04:21,871 --> 00:04:23,723
You're a lucky man, Leonard.

102
00:04:25,673 --> 00:04:28,122
- How so?
- You're talking to one of the three men

103
00:04:28,276 --> 00:04:31,961
in the Western hemisphere capable
of following that train of thought.

104
00:04:32,432 --> 00:04:33,891
Well, what do you think?

105
00:04:34,045 --> 00:04:36,656
I said I could follow it.
I didn't say I care.

106
00:04:57,943 --> 00:04:59,996
Subtitles: swsub.com

107
00:05:08,507 --> 00:05:10,289
I admire your fingering.

108
00:05:11,438 --> 00:05:12,438
Thank you.

109
00:05:14,159 --> 00:05:16,875
Maybe sometime you can try that
on my instrument.

110
00:05:25,981 --> 00:05:27,544
- G'night, guys. Good job.
- Thanks.

111
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:29,145
See you next week.

112
00:05:29,562 --> 00:05:32,308
- That was fun. Thanks for including me.
- You're welcome.

113
00:05:32,674 --> 00:05:35,645
If you're up for it, we could practice
that middle section again.

114
00:05:35,843 --> 00:05:36,846
Sure, why not?

115
00:05:43,609 --> 00:05:45,217
Just so we're clear,
you understand

116
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:47,231
that me hanging back
to practice with you

117
00:05:47,366 --> 00:05:49,816
is a pretext for letting you know
that I'm sexually available.

118
00:05:57,262 --> 00:05:58,262
Really?

119
00:05:58,555 --> 00:05:59,894
Yeah, I'm good to go.

120
00:06:00,739 --> 00:06:02,563
I thought you weren't interested in me.

121
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:04,502
That was before I saw you handling

122
00:06:04,675 --> 00:06:07,087
that beautiful piece
of wood between your legs.

123
00:06:09,221 --> 00:06:10,571
You mean my cello?

124
00:06:10,837 --> 00:06:13,384
No, I mean the obvious,
crude, double entendre.

125
00:06:13,579 --> 00:06:14,851
I'm seducing you.

126
00:06:16,794 --> 00:06:17,875
No kidding.

127
00:06:19,086 --> 00:06:21,206
What can I say?
I'm a passionate and impulsive woman.

128
00:06:23,342 --> 00:06:24,342
So how about it?

129
00:06:27,271 --> 00:06:28,332
Is it the waitress?

130
00:06:30,176 --> 00:06:31,199
What about her?

131
00:06:31,411 --> 00:06:33,766
I thought I saw your pupils
dilate when you looked at her.

132
00:06:33,939 --> 00:06:37,161
Which, unless you're a heroin addict,
points to sexual attraction.

133
00:06:38,699 --> 00:06:40,648
I did have a poppy seed bagel
for breakfast.

134
00:06:40,802 --> 00:06:43,712
Which could cause a positive
urine test for opiates,

135
00:06:43,842 --> 00:06:45,545
but certainly not dilate my pupils.

136
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:48,246
So I guess there was no point
in bringing it up.

137
00:06:49,469 --> 00:06:51,154
You and the waitress then.

138
00:06:51,398 --> 00:06:52,398
No... no.

139
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:55,074
There's nothing going on
between Penny and me.

140
00:06:55,661 --> 00:06:57,702
So you're open
to a sexual relationship?

141
00:06:59,174 --> 00:07:00,814
Yeah, yeah, I guess I am.

142
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:03,618
- Good.
- Yeah, it is. It is good.

143
00:07:05,924 --> 00:07:07,571
Did you want to start now?

144
00:07:08,108 --> 00:07:09,962
Why don't we finish
the section first?

145
00:07:11,325 --> 00:07:13,301
A little musical foreplay.
Terrific.

146
00:07:34,811 --> 00:07:35,814
I'm good to go.

147
00:07:36,074 --> 00:07:37,077
Me, too.

148
00:07:49,051 --> 00:07:50,440
Hey, Sheldon.
What's going on?

149
00:07:50,768 --> 00:07:53,007
I need your opinion
on a matter of semiotics.

150
00:07:53,567 --> 00:07:54,599
I'm sorry?

151
00:07:55,118 --> 00:07:57,136
Semiotics.
The study of signs and symbols.

152
00:07:57,291 --> 00:07:59,962
It's a branch of philosophy
related to linguistics.

153
00:08:01,739 --> 00:08:05,362
Okay, sweetie, I know you think
you're explaing yourself,

154
00:08:05,535 --> 00:08:07,117
but you're really not.

155
00:08:09,608 --> 00:08:10,900
Just come with me.

156
00:08:15,682 --> 00:08:17,636
- Well?
- Well, what?

157
00:08:18,163 --> 00:08:19,513
What does it mean?

158
00:08:20,358 --> 00:08:22,351
Oh, come on,
you went to college.

159
00:08:22,529 --> 00:08:23,821
Yes, but I was 11.

160
00:08:26,724 --> 00:08:28,803
All right, look,
a tie on the doorknob usually means

161
00:08:28,949 --> 00:08:30,570
someone doesn't want to be disturbed

162
00:08:30,744 --> 00:08:33,818
because, they're...
you know, gettin' busy.

163
00:08:36,017 --> 00:08:37,908
So you're saying Leonard
has a girl in there?

164
00:08:38,139 --> 00:08:40,438
Well, either that
or he's lost his tie rack

165
00:08:40,573 --> 00:08:42,643
and gotten really into Bryan Adams.

166
00:08:44,004 --> 00:08:46,007
Oh, Leonard, you magnificent beast.

167
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:51,793
We really shouldn't be standing here.

168
00:08:54,165 --> 00:08:55,715
This is very awkward.

169
00:08:56,217 --> 00:08:59,321
Oh, come on, Leonard's had
girls over before, right?

170
00:09:00,069 --> 00:09:03,685
Yes, but there's usually planning,
courtship, advance notice...

171
00:09:04,973 --> 00:09:08,834
Last time, I was able to book a cruise
to the Arctic to see a solar eclipse.

172
00:09:10,252 --> 00:09:13,538
You had to leave the state
because your roommate was having sex?

173
00:09:13,852 --> 00:09:16,764
I didn't have to.
The dates just happened to coincide.

174
00:09:19,730 --> 00:09:21,778
So, do you know who's in there?

175
00:09:22,902 --> 00:09:24,452
Well, there's Leonard.

176
00:09:28,047 --> 00:09:31,623
And he's either with Leslie Winkle
or a 1930s gangster.

177
00:09:35,667 --> 00:09:36,941
Good for him.

178
00:09:37,821 --> 00:09:39,440
Good for Leonard.

179
00:09:41,275 --> 00:09:42,347
Okay, g'night.

180
00:09:42,559 --> 00:09:44,009
No, no, wait, hold on.

181
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:45,300
What's the matter?

182
00:09:45,902 --> 00:09:47,633
I don't know what the protocol is here.

183
00:09:49,546 --> 00:09:51,170
Do I stay? Do I leave?

184
00:09:51,692 --> 00:09:54,294
Do I wait to greet them
with a refreshing beverage?

185
00:09:57,124 --> 00:09:58,583
You're asking the wrong girl.

186
00:09:58,732 --> 00:10:00,651
I'm usually
on the other side of the tie.

187
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:22,886
Hi, Leonard?

188
00:10:26,306 --> 00:10:28,632
It's me, Sheldon...

189
00:10:30,907 --> 00:10:32,288
In the living room.

190
00:10:32,809 --> 00:10:35,147
I just... I wanted you
to know I saw the tie.

191
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:36,674
Message received.

192
00:10:40,629 --> 00:10:41,824
You're welcome.

193
00:10:43,724 --> 00:10:44,727
You carry on.

194
00:10:44,879 --> 00:10:46,498
Give my best to Leslie.

195
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,536
Big Boy...

196
00:11:51,709 --> 00:11:53,329
Someone touched my board.

197
00:11:57,088 --> 00:11:58,535
Oh, God, my board!

198
00:12:04,888 --> 00:12:06,466
Hey, what's the matter?

199
00:12:06,679 --> 00:12:08,860
My equations, someone's tampered
with my equations.

200
00:12:09,213 --> 00:12:10,699
- Are you sure?
- Of course I am.

201
00:12:10,834 --> 00:12:12,956
Look at the beta function
of quantum chromodynamics.

202
00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:14,673
The sign's been changed.

203
00:12:15,575 --> 00:12:16,575
Oh, yeah.

204
00:12:16,982 --> 00:12:19,160
But doesn't that fix the problem
you've been having?

205
00:12:19,288 --> 00:12:21,673
Are you insane?
Are you out of your mind?

206
00:12:21,805 --> 00:12:22,576
Are you-- Look!

207
00:12:22,726 --> 00:12:25,041
That fixes the problem
I've been having.

208
00:12:26,443 --> 00:12:27,599
You're welcome.

209
00:12:29,502 --> 00:12:30,851
You did this?

210
00:12:32,192 --> 00:12:34,854
I noticed it when I got up
to get a glass of water. So I fixed it.

211
00:12:34,989 --> 00:12:37,963
Now you can show that quarks are
asymptotically free at high energies.

212
00:12:38,083 --> 00:12:39,162
Pretty cool, huh?

213
00:12:41,485 --> 00:12:42,506
"Cool"?

214
00:12:43,747 --> 00:12:46,643
Listen, I've got to get to the lab.
Thanks for a great night.

215
00:12:48,393 --> 00:12:49,859
Thank you.
I'll see you at work.

216
00:12:50,376 --> 00:12:52,015
Hold on. Hold on!

217
00:12:52,974 --> 00:12:55,076
- What?
- Who told you you could touch my board?

218
00:12:55,842 --> 00:12:56,696
No one.

219
00:12:56,864 --> 00:12:58,997
I don't come into your house
and touch your board.

220
00:12:59,437 --> 00:13:01,688
There are no incorrect equations
on my board.

221
00:13:05,226 --> 00:13:06,478
Oh, that is so...

222
00:13:07,047 --> 00:13:08,011
so...

223
00:13:10,244 --> 00:13:13,716
Sorry, I've got to run. If you come up
with an adjective, text me.

224
00:13:17,397 --> 00:13:18,401
Inconsiderate.

225
00:13:18,544 --> 00:13:21,037
That is the adjective,
"inconsiderate. "

226
00:13:23,092 --> 00:13:25,926
You can stare at your board all day.
She's still going to be right.

227
00:13:26,118 --> 00:13:27,942
I'm not staring, I'm hauling.

228
00:13:30,466 --> 00:13:31,466
So...

229
00:13:31,763 --> 00:13:33,229
how's it going?

230
00:13:36,621 --> 00:13:37,854
Pretty good.

231
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:42,326
Just pretty good?
I'd think you were doing very good.

232
00:13:44,136 --> 00:13:46,568
Pretty, very...
there's really no objective scale

233
00:13:46,721 --> 00:13:49,771
for delineating variations of "good."
Why do you ask?

234
00:13:50,398 --> 00:13:51,794
Well, a little bird told me

235
00:13:51,929 --> 00:13:54,164
that you and Leslie
hooked up last night.

236
00:13:59,257 --> 00:14:01,713
So, is it serious?
Do you like her?

237
00:14:02,272 --> 00:14:03,312
I don't...

238
00:14:05,465 --> 00:14:07,399
That's really two different questions.

239
00:14:07,730 --> 00:14:08,849
I'm not...

240
00:14:09,106 --> 00:14:10,626
Sheldon, we have to go!

241
00:14:11,188 --> 00:14:14,352
You're wound awfully tight for a man
who's just had sexual intercourse.

242
00:14:16,817 --> 00:14:19,683
All right, I'll talk to you later,
but I am so happy for you.

243
00:14:21,991 --> 00:14:22,994
Thank you.

244
00:14:26,261 --> 00:14:28,611
What did she mean
she's happy for me?

245
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:30,936
Is she happy that
I'm seeing someone?

246
00:14:31,145 --> 00:14:33,102
Or is she happy because
she thinks that I am?

247
00:14:33,242 --> 00:14:36,054
Because anyone who cared for someone
would want them to be happy.

248
00:14:36,189 --> 00:14:39,835
Even if the reason for their happiness
made the first person unhappy.

249
00:14:40,592 --> 00:14:42,658
Because the second person,
though happy,

250
00:14:42,811 --> 00:14:45,842
is now romantically unavailable
to the first person.

251
00:14:46,456 --> 00:14:50,270
Do you realize I may have to share
a Nobel Prize with your booty call?

252
00:14:53,898 --> 00:14:54,898
You know what?

253
00:14:55,764 --> 00:14:57,137
I'm being ridiculous.

254
00:14:58,167 --> 00:14:59,803
Who cares what Penny thinks?

255
00:15:00,106 --> 00:15:02,397
Leslie is a terrific girl.
She's attractive.

256
00:15:02,517 --> 00:15:05,015
We like each other.
She's extremely intelligent...

257
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:07,945
- She's not that intelligent.
- She fixed your equation.

258
00:15:08,215 --> 00:15:10,152
- She got lucky.
- You don't believe in luck.

259
00:15:10,307 --> 00:15:12,893
I don't have to believe
in it for her to be lucky.

260
00:15:13,993 --> 00:15:16,722
Regardless, I have a chance
at a real relationship with Leslie.

261
00:15:16,842 --> 00:15:18,207
I'm not going to pass that up

262
00:15:18,373 --> 00:15:20,592
for some hypothetical future
of happiness with a woman

263
00:15:21,017 --> 00:15:23,129
who may or may not
want me to be happy,

264
00:15:23,343 --> 00:15:26,099
with a woman who is
currently making me happy.

265
00:15:28,856 --> 00:15:30,306
I still don't care.

266
00:15:40,727 --> 00:15:44,047
Careful, Leonard. Liquid nitrogen,
320 degrees below zero.

267
00:15:52,836 --> 00:15:55,280
Why are you smashing
a flash-frozen banana?

268
00:15:55,492 --> 00:15:58,501
Because I got a bowl of Cheerios
and I couldn't find a knife.

269
00:16:00,653 --> 00:16:01,653
So anyway...

270
00:16:03,158 --> 00:16:04,158
Hello.

271
00:16:07,046 --> 00:16:08,373
What are you doing?

272
00:16:09,104 --> 00:16:10,666
Just extending the intimacy.

273
00:16:11,174 --> 00:16:13,293
Do you want to slip over
to the radiation lab

274
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:15,770
and share a decontamination shower?

275
00:16:20,407 --> 00:16:23,088
What exactly do you think's
going on between us?

276
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:27,982
I'm not sure, but I think I'm about
to discover how the banana felt.

277
00:16:32,446 --> 00:16:34,704
Listen,
neither of us are neuroscientists,

278
00:16:34,954 --> 00:16:36,857
but we both understand
the biochemistry of sex.

279
00:16:37,011 --> 00:16:38,446
I mean, dopamine in our brains

280
00:16:38,581 --> 00:16:40,539
is released across synapses,
causing pleasure.

281
00:16:40,663 --> 00:16:43,254
You stick electrodes in a rat's brain,
give him an orgasm button,

282
00:16:43,374 --> 00:16:45,413
he'll push that thing
until he starves to death.

283
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:48,034
Well, who wouldn't?

284
00:16:48,525 --> 00:16:50,550
Well, the only difference
between us and the rat

285
00:16:50,681 --> 00:16:52,958
is that you can't stick an
electrode in our hypothalamus.

286
00:16:53,113 --> 00:16:54,562
That's where you come in.

287
00:16:56,780 --> 00:16:59,423
Yeah, well, I'm just glad
to be a part of it.

288
00:17:00,907 --> 00:17:02,084
So what happens now?

289
00:17:02,296 --> 00:17:05,853
I don't know about your sex drive,
but I'm probably good till New Year's.

290
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:12,982
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

291
00:17:16,505 --> 00:17:18,145
You want to make plans for New Year's?

292
00:17:18,347 --> 00:17:19,717
Please.
You're smothering me.

293
00:17:22,933 --> 00:17:24,553
Look. It's Dr. Stud!

294
00:17:26,610 --> 00:17:27,632
Dr. What?

295
00:17:27,810 --> 00:17:30,455
The blogosphere is a-buzzin'
with news of you and Leslie Winkle

296
00:17:30,648 --> 00:17:32,810
making <i>eine kleine
bang-bang musik</i>.

297
00:17:34,711 --> 00:17:36,100
How did it get on the Internet?

298
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:37,472
I put it there.

299
00:17:38,668 --> 00:17:40,133
How did you know about it?

300
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:41,846
A little bird told us.

301
00:17:43,141 --> 00:17:45,691
Apparently,
you are a magnificent beast.

302
00:17:48,806 --> 00:17:50,105
That part's true.

303
00:17:56,980 --> 00:17:59,180
I think I may have
misjudged this restaurant.

304
00:17:59,426 --> 00:18:01,405
- No kidding.
- I don't want to go out on a limb,

305
00:18:01,598 --> 00:18:04,507
but I think we may be looking
at my new Tuesday hamburger.

306
00:18:05,990 --> 00:18:08,844
Your old Tuesday hamburger
will be so brokenhearted.

307
00:18:10,442 --> 00:18:13,196
Way ahead of you. I was thinking
of moving Big Boy to Thursdays,

308
00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:15,199
and just dropping Souplantation.

309
00:18:16,647 --> 00:18:17,647
Really?

310
00:18:18,138 --> 00:18:21,164
The name always confused me anyway.
Souplantation.

311
00:18:21,513 --> 00:18:22,963
You can't grow soup.

312
00:18:26,439 --> 00:18:28,182
So, how's everything?

313
00:18:28,558 --> 00:18:31,321
Terrific. You'll be happy to know
that I plan to come here

314
00:18:31,501 --> 00:18:33,446
every Tuesday night
for the foreseeable future.

315
00:18:33,574 --> 00:18:34,595
Really?

316
00:18:37,258 --> 00:18:39,997
Who do I speak to about
permanently reserving this table?

317
00:18:41,062 --> 00:18:43,126
I don't know...
A psychiatrist?

318
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:46,290
So, hey,

319
00:18:47,072 --> 00:18:49,117
how are things with you and Leslie?

320
00:18:50,188 --> 00:18:52,716
To be honest, I don't think
it's going to work out.

321
00:18:54,323 --> 00:18:55,615
Oh, that's too bad.

322
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:57,257
Hey, don't worry.

323
00:18:57,431 --> 00:19:00,634
I'm sure there's someone out there
who's just right for you.

324
00:19:03,736 --> 00:19:05,337
What did she mean by that?!

325
00:19:06,570 --> 00:19:08,487
Was that just a generic platitude,

326
00:19:08,641 --> 00:19:10,589
or was that a subtle bid
for attention?

327
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:15,671
You know why this hamburger
surpasses the Big Boy?

328
00:19:16,510 --> 00:19:19,533
This is a single-decker hamburger,
whereas the Big Boy is a double-decker.

329
00:19:19,707 --> 00:19:22,967
This has a much more satisfying
meat-to-bun-to-condiment ratio.

330
00:19:24,504 --> 00:19:26,079
Are you even listening to me?

331
00:19:26,291 --> 00:19:29,906
Of course, I'm listening.
Blah, blah, hopeless Penny delusion...

332
00:19:32,702 --> 00:19:33,761
Okay, then.

333
00:19:36,269 --> 00:19:38,965
You know, you can grow
the ingredients for soup.
