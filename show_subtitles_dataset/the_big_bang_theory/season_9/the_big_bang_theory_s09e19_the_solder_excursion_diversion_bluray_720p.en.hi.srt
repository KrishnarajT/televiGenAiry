1
00:00:01,252 --> 00:00:04,086
I didn't understand your e-mail.

2
00:00:04,088 --> 00:00:07,156
Uh, can you repeat that?
You're breaking up.

3
00:00:07,158 --> 00:00:10,259
I didn't understand your e-mail.

4
00:00:10,261 --> 00:00:13,229
Ah. Yeah, I had to get
a little creative

5
00:00:13,231 --> 00:00:17,667
because the S, R and M keys
on my laptop stopped working.

6
00:00:17,669 --> 00:00:20,670
"Deaw Aby,
could you pleathe dwive be

7
00:00:20,672 --> 00:00:25,274
to the twain thtow
thubtibe tobowow?"

8
00:00:26,244 --> 00:00:29,245
So, is that a yes?

9
00:00:29,247 --> 00:00:31,781
Sheldon, why don't you get
a new computer?

10
00:00:31,783 --> 00:00:33,716
You know that one's out-of-date.

11
00:00:33,718 --> 00:00:35,952
Oh, but I like this computer.

12
00:00:35,954 --> 00:00:39,622
The video is failing,
and the sound is cutting out.

13
00:00:39,624 --> 00:00:42,024
I'm sorry, I didn't get that.

14
00:00:42,026 --> 00:00:44,260
The video is failing,

15
00:00:44,262 --> 00:00:46,395
and the sound is cutting out.

16
00:00:46,397 --> 00:00:50,600
I'm sorry, one more time.
The sound is cutting out.

17
00:00:54,172 --> 00:00:55,505
I can't read that!

18
00:00:55,507 --> 00:00:57,640
The video is failing!

19
00:00:57,642 --> 00:01:00,877
Get a new computer.

20
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:02,044
What?

21
00:01:02,046 --> 00:01:04,146
Get a new computer.

22
00:01:04,148 --> 00:01:05,882
What?

23
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:09,619
Hello?

24
00:01:09,621 --> 00:01:11,787

== sync, corrected by elderman ==
@elder_man

35
00:01:40,696 --> 00:01:42,095
This is cool.

36
00:01:42,097 --> 00:01:44,164
When was the last time you
and I built something together?

37
00:01:44,166 --> 00:01:46,866
Scientifically?
A little over a year ago.

38
00:01:46,868 --> 00:01:49,169
LEGOs? Last week in my room.

39
00:01:49,171 --> 00:01:51,705
If there was a Nobrize
for Millennium Falcons

40
00:01:51,707 --> 00:01:54,674
that fall apart when
you pick them up, we'd be set.

41
00:01:54,676 --> 00:01:55,954
Hey, guys!

42
00:01:55,955 --> 00:01:56,475
Hey.

43
00:01:56,611 --> 00:01:57,711
What are you doing here?

44
00:01:57,713 --> 00:01:59,346
We heard there were
some sexy scientists

45
00:01:59,348 --> 00:02:01,247
working hard all weekend.
Yeah,

46
00:02:01,249 --> 00:02:04,718
so we brought you some lunch and
we are gonna go look for 'em.

47
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:06,753
Soup, sandwiches
and emasculation,

48
00:02:06,755 --> 00:02:08,989
just like my mom
used to make.

49
00:02:08,991 --> 00:02:10,223
So, how's it goin'?

50
00:02:10,225 --> 00:02:11,725
Good. Slow.

51
00:02:11,727 --> 00:02:13,460
There's a lot of tedious setup,
but once we get through that

52
00:02:13,462 --> 00:02:14,461
it should go quicker.

53
00:02:14,463 --> 00:02:16,196
Is there anything
we can do to help?

54
00:02:16,198 --> 00:02:18,331
You know what,
this part isn't that technical.

55
00:02:18,333 --> 00:02:19,432
You actually could.

56
00:02:19,434 --> 00:02:22,736
Wow, really? Called my bluff.
All righty then.

57
00:02:22,738 --> 00:02:24,738
Can we really help?

58
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:26,239
While we finish soldering
these boards, it'd be great

59
00:02:26,241 --> 00:02:28,775
if you guys could wrap these
pipe fittings with Teflon tape.

60
00:02:28,777 --> 00:02:29,776
I'll show you
how to do one.

61
00:02:29,778 --> 00:02:31,411
Hey, w-wouldn't it be funny

62
00:02:31,413 --> 00:02:32,979
if after all your years
of hard work,

63
00:02:32,981 --> 00:02:36,016
I'm the one who makes
a scientific breakthrough?

64
00:02:39,354 --> 00:02:42,589
He doesn't think
that's funny.

65
00:02:56,371 --> 00:02:58,738
I got here
as quickly as I could.

66
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:01,041
You're too late.

67
00:03:19,895 --> 00:03:22,128
Sheldon, this is silly.

68
00:03:22,130 --> 00:03:25,465
You got emotional
when that lab monkey died.

69
00:03:25,467 --> 00:03:29,402
That lab monkey told me
he loved me in sign language.

70
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:40,947
Great.

71
00:03:40,949 --> 00:03:44,284
Now I'm gonna have that song
in my head all day.

72
00:03:45,187 --> 00:03:46,586
Look, I'm-I'm sorry

73
00:03:46,588 --> 00:03:48,922
for your loss, but I think

74
00:03:48,924 --> 00:03:51,791
I have something
that might make you feel better.

75
00:03:51,793 --> 00:03:54,961
I got you a new computer!

76
00:03:56,698 --> 00:03:59,065
How could you do that?

77
00:03:59,067 --> 00:04:00,900
Do what?

78
00:04:00,902 --> 00:04:04,104
Choosing a new laptop is
an incredibly personal ritual.

79
00:04:04,106 --> 00:04:05,472
You have taken away

80
00:04:05,474 --> 00:04:08,341
weeks of agonizing thought,
tedious research,

81
00:04:08,343 --> 00:04:11,711
sleepless nights filled
with indecision. I j...

82
00:04:12,547 --> 00:04:14,714
Haven't I lost enough today?

83
00:04:16,017 --> 00:04:20,620
Well, the guy at the store said
this one is great.

84
00:04:20,622 --> 00:04:22,589
Oh! Oh, the guy!

85
00:04:22,591 --> 00:04:24,557
Oh, pardon me.

86
00:04:24,559 --> 00:04:26,192
I-I didn't realize
you'd spoken to the guy.

87
00:04:26,194 --> 00:04:27,760
Yeah, tell me,

88
00:04:27,762 --> 00:04:30,330
did the guy choose one
with a 4K display

89
00:04:30,332 --> 00:04:31,731
and a Thunderbolt port?

90
00:04:31,733 --> 00:04:32,932
Yes.
Yeah?

91
00:04:32,934 --> 00:04:34,100
D-Did the guy make sure

92
00:04:34,102 --> 00:04:36,870
that this has a one-terabyte
solid-state drive?

93
00:04:36,872 --> 00:04:38,404
Yes.
Yeah? Oh, well,

94
00:04:38,406 --> 00:04:41,608
was this guy Rick from
Computer Solutions on Colorado?

95
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:42,575
Yes.

96
00:04:42,577 --> 00:04:43,943
Yeah, well,
he does know his stuff.

97
00:04:46,982 --> 00:04:48,815
After you wrap the body
in reflective tape,

98
00:04:48,817 --> 00:04:50,984
the ends get Teflon tape
so we can get a tight seal.

99
00:04:50,986 --> 00:04:53,119
Like this? Oh.
Yeah, perfect.

100
00:04:53,121 --> 00:04:54,854
And it helps to have
small, delicate fingers.

101
00:04:54,856 --> 00:04:56,456
So don't be discouraged
if you can't do it as fast

102
00:04:56,458 --> 00:04:58,091
as me and Howard.

103
00:04:59,427 --> 00:05:00,793
I don't know
if we have enough solder

104
00:05:00,795 --> 00:05:02,028
to finish
these circuit boards.

105
00:05:02,030 --> 00:05:03,259
We had a full spool yesterday.

106
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:04,061
What can I say,

107
00:05:04,065 --> 00:05:06,666
I play hard,
I solder even harder.

108
00:05:08,236 --> 00:05:10,236
Sometimes he solders at home
with his shirt off.

109
00:05:10,238 --> 00:05:12,238
It's like a beer commercial.

110
00:05:14,943 --> 00:05:16,943
Well, we got to make a run
to the hardware store.

111
00:05:16,945 --> 00:05:19,245
How can you call yourself a
scientist and run out of solder?

112
00:05:19,247 --> 00:05:22,048
Well, funny story.
So, we have plenty

113
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:23,983
of the 60/40
tin-to-lead ratio solder,

114
00:05:23,985 --> 00:05:26,645
but the spools look a lot
like the 63/37 tin-to...

115
00:05:26,646 --> 00:05:27,285
Honey, honey,

116
00:05:27,289 --> 00:05:30,690
honey, let me stop you.
That is-is not a funny story.

117
00:05:31,826 --> 00:05:33,560
You want to come with us?

118
00:05:33,562 --> 00:05:35,085
I'm kind of getting
into the groove here.

119
00:05:35,086 --> 00:05:35,706
Yeah, you guys run

120
00:05:35,730 --> 00:05:38,551
to the store and let the women
handle the science for a change.

121
00:05:38,552 --> 00:05:39,230
Okay.

122
00:05:39,234 --> 00:05:41,267
We'll be back
as soon as we can.

123
00:05:41,269 --> 00:05:44,537
Okay, so what...

124
00:05:44,539 --> 00:05:46,739
is solder?

125
00:05:48,910 --> 00:05:51,878
I suppose I should
set this up.

126
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:55,515
Or would you like
to rob me of that, too?

127
00:05:55,517 --> 00:05:58,484
Knock it off or I'll start
making W-H sounds

128
00:05:58,486 --> 00:06:01,521
for words
that just have a W.

129
00:06:01,523 --> 00:06:02,155
You wouldn't.

130
00:06:02,157 --> 00:06:05,491
"Hwatch" me.

131
00:06:06,394 --> 00:06:07,794
Fine. I'm sorry.

132
00:06:07,796 --> 00:06:09,662
Thank you for
the thoughtful gift.

133
00:06:09,664 --> 00:06:11,264
I really do appreciate it.

134
00:06:11,266 --> 00:06:15,668
As you know, I had become
attached to my old laptop.

135
00:06:15,670 --> 00:06:17,203
But I'm sure, in time,
that this one will...

136
00:06:17,205 --> 00:06:19,138
Jeepers creepers,

137
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:21,341
that started up fast!

138
00:06:21,343 --> 00:06:23,376
I thought you might
like it.

139
00:06:23,378 --> 00:06:25,578
Look at the 4K resolution.

140
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:27,347
Next time we Skype,
I'm gonna count

141
00:06:27,349 --> 00:06:30,350
all those nostril hairs.

142
00:06:30,352 --> 00:06:32,986
Or you could just look
into my eyes.

143
00:06:32,988 --> 00:06:35,088
But you only have two eyes.

144
00:06:35,090 --> 00:06:38,224
You got a lot of nostril hairs.

145
00:06:38,226 --> 00:06:40,717
Well, you know,
as long as you're happy.

146
00:06:40,741 --> 00:06:42,263
Oh.

147
00:06:42,264 --> 00:06:43,730
I am.

148
00:06:43,732 --> 00:06:46,366
And Rick said you could bring in
your old one to recycle it.

149
00:06:46,368 --> 00:06:49,269
Oh. Uh, no, no, no, thank you.

150
00:06:49,271 --> 00:06:50,870
Oh, but he said
you can get store credit.

151
00:06:50,872 --> 00:06:53,539
Well, no, I just...
I-I don't want to recycle it.

152
00:06:53,541 --> 00:06:55,141
And I don't want store credit.

153
00:06:55,143 --> 00:06:56,042
But why wouldn't...

154
00:06:56,044 --> 00:06:57,877
Can we please change
the subject?

155
00:06:57,879 --> 00:07:00,446
O-Okay.

156
00:07:00,448 --> 00:07:03,783
How 'bout we change it to why
you're being weird about this?

157
00:07:03,785 --> 00:07:04,884
I'm not being weird.

158
00:07:04,886 --> 00:07:07,120
I...

159
00:07:07,122 --> 00:07:09,122
It's hard to explain.

160
00:07:09,124 --> 00:07:13,026
Sheldon, just tell me.

161
00:07:13,895 --> 00:07:15,928
It might be easier to show you.

162
00:07:15,930 --> 00:07:18,097
Okay.

163
00:07:18,967 --> 00:07:21,534
We'd have to take your car.

164
00:07:21,536 --> 00:07:23,703
All right.

165
00:07:26,074 --> 00:07:29,709
And I'm gonna need you to sign
a nondisclosure agreement.

166
00:07:30,679 --> 00:07:34,047
Well, I signed one
before we slept together.

167
00:07:34,049 --> 00:07:36,215
Why not now?

168
00:07:40,255 --> 00:07:43,122
Penny says they're having fun
working on the prototype.

169
00:07:43,124 --> 00:07:46,793
Remember when her fun was
nightclubs and drinking games?

170
00:07:46,795 --> 00:07:49,429
I know. I'm lowering
the bar so slowly.

171
00:07:49,431 --> 00:07:52,565
This time next year
she'll have a coin collection.

172
00:07:52,567 --> 00:07:53,966
Excuse me.

173
00:07:53,968 --> 00:07:56,235
You guys interested in a free
screening of an upcoming movie?

174
00:07:56,237 --> 00:07:57,136
Oh. Sorry, we can't.

175
00:07:57,138 --> 00:07:59,105
Well, hang on.
What movie is it?

176
00:07:59,107 --> 00:08:01,908
Oh, I can't tell you.
But it does star Will Smith.

177
00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:03,776
Wait.

178
00:08:03,778 --> 00:08:05,211
I bet it's Suicide Squad.

179
00:08:05,213 --> 00:08:07,013
Let's check it out.

180
00:08:07,015 --> 00:08:08,214
What about the girls?

181
00:08:08,216 --> 00:08:10,016
Penny just said
they're having fun.

182
00:08:10,018 --> 00:08:12,552
Honestly, you want to wrap tape
around a bunch of pipe fittings

183
00:08:12,554 --> 00:08:14,020
all afternoon?

184
00:08:14,989 --> 00:08:16,222
Okay, we'll take 'em.

185
00:08:16,224 --> 00:08:18,057
Okay.
But, I swear,

186
00:08:18,059 --> 00:08:20,059
if it's Will Smith
in Shark Tale 2,

187
00:08:20,061 --> 00:08:23,429
it better be at least as good
as the original.

188
00:08:24,666 --> 00:08:26,332
I mean, it's crazy,
isn't it?

189
00:08:26,334 --> 00:08:28,468
I moved here from Nebraska
to be an actress,

190
00:08:28,470 --> 00:08:31,437
and now I'm sitting
in an engineering lab at Caltech

191
00:08:31,439 --> 00:08:35,641
helping to build a prototype
for a high-tech guidance system.

192
00:08:35,643 --> 00:08:37,643
It is crazy. It's also crazy

193
00:08:37,645 --> 00:08:41,147
that I've made 14 of these
and you've made three.

194
00:08:44,085 --> 00:08:46,552
Hey. Where are the guys?

195
00:08:46,554 --> 00:08:47,954
Oh, they went to the store
to get solder,

196
00:08:47,956 --> 00:08:51,557
which is metal you melt
to make science things.

197
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:54,060
Since when
do you work on weekends?

198
00:08:54,062 --> 00:08:55,561
I'm an astrophysicist.

199
00:08:55,563 --> 00:08:57,830
The stars don't take a day off.

200
00:08:57,832 --> 00:09:00,633
You were home alone
and had no one to play with?

201
00:09:00,635 --> 00:09:03,903
Well, the cleaning lady was
there, but she doesn't like me.

202
00:09:05,073 --> 00:09:06,439
You need any help?

203
00:09:06,441 --> 00:09:09,075
Not with
Lightning McQueen here.

204
00:09:09,077 --> 00:09:10,810
I think we're good.

205
00:09:10,812 --> 00:09:12,378
Okay. That's cool.

206
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:14,714
I guess everybody's involved
in this project but me.

207
00:09:14,716 --> 00:09:17,483
So... see ya.

208
00:09:20,155 --> 00:09:21,187
I feel bad.

209
00:09:21,189 --> 00:09:22,255
Should we have asked him
to stay?

210
00:09:22,257 --> 00:09:24,424
Yes.

211
00:09:27,595 --> 00:09:29,996
Will you please tell me
where we're going?

212
00:09:29,998 --> 00:09:33,666
Sorry, you're on
a need-to-know basis.

213
00:09:34,602 --> 00:09:35,902
I'm driving the car.

214
00:09:35,904 --> 00:09:38,271
I need to know.

215
00:09:38,273 --> 00:09:39,338
Right.

216
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:41,040
So where are we going?

217
00:09:41,042 --> 00:09:44,544
No, I meant turn right,
and you missed it.

218
00:09:44,546 --> 00:09:47,213
Maybe you do need to know.

219
00:09:51,553 --> 00:09:52,752
What are we gonna tell
the girls?

220
00:09:52,754 --> 00:09:53,920
It's not a problem.

221
00:09:53,922 --> 00:09:55,054
I mean without lying.

222
00:09:55,056 --> 00:09:57,423
And now you've made it
a problem.

223
00:09:57,425 --> 00:09:59,492
Come on. We're
a couple of smart guys.

224
00:09:59,494 --> 00:10:01,360
I'm sure we can come up
with a way to explain this

225
00:10:01,362 --> 00:10:03,029
that doesn't make us
look bad.

226
00:10:04,899 --> 00:10:06,833
Oh!

227
00:10:06,835 --> 00:10:08,634
The boys had to drive
all the way to San Bernardino

228
00:10:08,636 --> 00:10:10,470
for the solder and got a flat.

229
00:10:13,575 --> 00:10:15,975
They bought it.

230
00:10:15,977 --> 00:10:17,543
But we're gonna have to

231
00:10:17,545 --> 00:10:19,178
put the spare on
before we go back.

232
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:20,880
Oh, you're good at this.

233
00:10:20,882 --> 00:10:23,216
Well, I lie a lot.

234
00:10:24,052 --> 00:10:25,718
Hey, guys, thank you

235
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:27,653
for being a part of our
test screening. You're about

236
00:10:27,655 --> 00:10:30,356
to be one of the first audiences
to see Suicide Squad.

237
00:10:30,358 --> 00:10:32,325
Hey!

238
00:10:32,327 --> 00:10:33,593
You were right.

239
00:10:33,595 --> 00:10:34,727
Oh, I keep telling you...

240
00:10:34,729 --> 00:10:38,264
good things happen
to bad people.

241
00:10:38,266 --> 00:10:40,299
Uh, we're gonna get started
in a couple minutes. Enjoy.

242
00:10:40,301 --> 00:10:42,368
Who are you texting?

243
00:10:42,370 --> 00:10:44,804
Raj. He really wants
to see this movie.

244
00:10:44,806 --> 00:10:46,772
Oh, he'll never
make it in time.

245
00:10:46,774 --> 00:10:49,642
I know.
I want to make him feel bad.

246
00:10:51,012 --> 00:10:54,480
"Ha, ha. Leonard and I are
about to see Suicide Squad.

247
00:10:54,482 --> 00:10:58,317
Spoiler alert: when I see you
I'm gonna spoil it."

248
00:10:58,319 --> 00:11:00,186
You're a good friend.

249
00:11:07,829 --> 00:11:10,162
Okay.

250
00:11:11,299 --> 00:11:15,968
Would you ladies please
leave the room for a moment?

251
00:11:15,970 --> 00:11:17,904
Why?

252
00:11:17,906 --> 00:11:21,874
I need to rub my genitals
on their prototype.

253
00:11:21,876 --> 00:11:24,176
What's going on?

254
00:11:24,178 --> 00:11:26,546
Leonard and Howard
don't have a flat.

255
00:11:26,548 --> 00:11:28,748
They went to the movies. Look.

256
00:11:29,684 --> 00:11:31,417
Son of a bitch.
Un-freakin' believable.

257
00:11:31,419 --> 00:11:33,686
Oh. You know what?
I'm gonna let them know

258
00:11:33,688 --> 00:11:35,988
that I'm here with you
and that they're busted.

259
00:11:35,990 --> 00:11:37,290
No. You know what? Don't. Don't.

260
00:11:37,292 --> 00:11:38,791
Let's let them think
they're getting away with it.

261
00:11:38,793 --> 00:11:41,861
Yeah, let's see how deep a hole
they can dig for themselves.

262
00:11:41,863 --> 00:11:43,329
Mm-hmm.
Interesting.

263
00:11:43,331 --> 00:11:45,464
I mean, it's not testicles
on a cryostat,

264
00:11:45,466 --> 00:11:47,667
but I like it.

265
00:11:55,851 --> 00:11:58,018
Why do you have
a storage unit?

266
00:11:58,020 --> 00:11:59,987
Just wait.

267
00:11:59,989 --> 00:12:02,089
How long have you had it?

268
00:12:03,726 --> 00:12:04,925
Just wait.

269
00:12:05,462 --> 00:12:07,662
Do you want me to hold
that computer?

270
00:12:07,664 --> 00:12:10,498
Just wai... You know what?
Actually, yes, thank you.

271
00:12:18,441 --> 00:12:21,743
Welcome to my Fortress of Shame.

272
00:12:26,783 --> 00:12:28,016
I'm sorry.

273
00:12:28,018 --> 00:12:30,318
What-what am I looking at?

274
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:33,655
It's basically everything
I've ever owned.

275
00:12:33,657 --> 00:12:36,457
Um, every book,

276
00:12:36,459 --> 00:12:40,461
every T-shirt, every piece
of broken electronics.

277
00:12:40,463 --> 00:12:43,631
Just... all of it.

278
00:12:46,536 --> 00:12:49,137
All of it?

279
00:12:49,139 --> 00:12:51,039
I have a Ziploc bag

280
00:12:51,041 --> 00:12:54,209
filled with all
my old Ziploc bags.

281
00:13:00,183 --> 00:13:02,917
Okay.

282
00:13:02,919 --> 00:13:04,986
Well...

283
00:13:04,988 --> 00:13:07,055
I would like to tell you

284
00:13:07,057 --> 00:13:09,824
that there is

285
00:13:09,826 --> 00:13:13,795
nothing here to be ashamed of.

286
00:13:15,031 --> 00:13:17,198
So I'm gonna need a minute.

287
00:13:22,005 --> 00:13:24,906
All right, how are we gonna
play this when they return?

288
00:13:24,908 --> 00:13:26,374
I know.

289
00:13:26,376 --> 00:13:29,544
You guys should totally
be making out with me.

290
00:13:31,681 --> 00:13:34,082
Sweetie, I know you think
jokes like that are funny,

291
00:13:34,084 --> 00:13:35,817
but do you really think
you could handle

292
00:13:35,819 --> 00:13:37,252
making out with both of us?

293
00:13:38,922 --> 00:13:40,255
No, ma'am.

294
00:13:42,859 --> 00:13:45,260
Okay. Okay,
how about this?

295
00:13:45,262 --> 00:13:46,361
They don't know
you're here with us,

296
00:13:46,363 --> 00:13:48,596
so you hide in the closet.
When they show up,

297
00:13:48,598 --> 00:13:50,164
we'll hear
whatever their dumb story is

298
00:13:50,166 --> 00:13:52,000
about where they were,
we'll pretend to believe them,

299
00:13:52,002 --> 00:13:54,736
and just when they think they
got away with it, you jump out.

300
00:13:54,738 --> 00:13:56,638
Yeah, that's pretty good.
I love it!

301
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:58,873
I'll be all like, "Busted!"

302
00:13:58,875 --> 00:14:00,341
And they'll be like, "What?"

303
00:14:00,343 --> 00:14:03,378
And then we'll all be like,
"Oh, yeah!"

304
00:14:04,781 --> 00:14:06,114
Yeah, I-I get it.

305
00:14:06,116 --> 00:14:08,316
I wouldn't make out
with me, either.

306
00:14:10,654 --> 00:14:13,621
In here is every clock radio
I've ever owned.

307
00:14:13,623 --> 00:14:15,523
Calculators, VHS tapes.

308
00:14:15,525 --> 00:14:16,925
Yeah. Oh.

309
00:14:16,927 --> 00:14:19,127
Sporting equipment.

310
00:14:21,131 --> 00:14:23,364
Y-You have sporting equipment?

311
00:14:23,366 --> 00:14:25,700
Well, oh, it's just a...
it's a... a golf ball

312
00:14:25,702 --> 00:14:27,702
that my brother
threw at my head.

313
00:14:27,704 --> 00:14:30,471
You can still
feel the dent.

314
00:14:30,473 --> 00:14:33,741
It's right next to
the hockey puck dent.

315
00:14:36,112 --> 00:14:38,680
Okay, why do you have
a bin of pinecones?

316
00:14:38,682 --> 00:14:41,115
I used to collect
them as a child.

317
00:14:41,117 --> 00:14:43,418
The spiral of scales open in

318
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:45,153
the Fibonacci sequence.

319
00:14:45,155 --> 00:14:47,055
A fact that,
when you tell your brother,

320
00:14:47,057 --> 00:14:49,991
gets a golf ball
thrown at your head.

321
00:14:52,295 --> 00:14:56,864
So, why do you feel
you need to save these things?

322
00:14:56,866 --> 00:14:59,100
I'd like to say it's nostalgia,

323
00:14:59,102 --> 00:15:02,170
but every time I think
of throwing anything away,

324
00:15:02,172 --> 00:15:03,738
my ears start to ring,

325
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:05,940
and I get butterflies
in my stomach.

326
00:15:05,942 --> 00:15:07,408
And then it feels like

327
00:15:07,410 --> 00:15:09,610
the butterflies
get eaten by rats,

328
00:15:09,612 --> 00:15:11,846
and then, the-the rats
get eaten by...

329
00:15:11,848 --> 00:15:12,814
Okay.

330
00:15:12,816 --> 00:15:14,449
I get it. I get it.

331
00:15:14,451 --> 00:15:17,352
It ends with dinosaurs.

332
00:15:19,389 --> 00:15:22,156
I'm sorry
if you think less of me.

333
00:15:23,059 --> 00:15:24,993
I don't.

334
00:15:24,995 --> 00:15:26,794
Really?

335
00:15:26,796 --> 00:15:28,796
'Cause every time
I come in here,

336
00:15:28,798 --> 00:15:30,698
I think less of me.

337
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:32,066
Why?

338
00:15:32,068 --> 00:15:33,901
Because I'm a fraud.

339
00:15:33,903 --> 00:15:35,336
No. I purport

340
00:15:35,338 --> 00:15:37,171
to be a man of the mind.

341
00:15:37,173 --> 00:15:40,908
I've been such a-a vocal
champion of The Singularity,

342
00:15:40,910 --> 00:15:42,744
but how can I leave
my body behind

343
00:15:42,746 --> 00:15:45,013
and become one
with the Internet

344
00:15:45,015 --> 00:15:47,715
when I've never even thrown
a toothbrush away?

345
00:15:49,919 --> 00:15:51,719
It's okay, Sheldon.

346
00:15:51,721 --> 00:15:55,156
You know, I... I've saved
a lot of weird things, too.

347
00:15:55,158 --> 00:15:57,358
Like what?

348
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:59,293
Well, um,

349
00:15:59,295 --> 00:16:02,697
did you know
I have a microscope slide

350
00:16:02,699 --> 00:16:04,132
with a little bit of tissue

351
00:16:04,134 --> 00:16:07,135
from the first brain
I ever dissected?

352
00:16:07,137 --> 00:16:09,337
I have an old teddy bear

353
00:16:09,339 --> 00:16:11,939
I secretly wiped my nose on
for years.

354
00:16:18,848 --> 00:16:21,416
It's not a contest.

355
00:16:23,686 --> 00:16:26,254
Okay, here they come.
Go hide.

356
00:16:26,256 --> 00:16:28,322
Oh, man, when I come out
of the closet,

357
00:16:28,324 --> 00:16:30,925
I'm gonna nail those guys!

358
00:16:33,029 --> 00:16:35,029
Yeah, I heard it. Shut up.

359
00:16:40,470 --> 00:16:41,769
Hey.
Hi.

360
00:16:41,771 --> 00:16:43,805
Hey, what's this?

361
00:16:43,807 --> 00:16:45,740
Listen, we did a stupid thing.

362
00:16:45,742 --> 00:16:49,544
We went to a movie and
lied about it, but we feel bad

363
00:16:49,546 --> 00:16:51,245
and want to make it up
to you.

364
00:16:51,247 --> 00:16:53,014
So, these are for you,
and if you're not too mad,

365
00:16:53,016 --> 00:16:54,241
we'd love to take
you guys to dinner.

366
00:16:54,242 --> 00:16:54,770
Yeah.

367
00:16:54,784 --> 00:16:57,185
Anywhere you want.
Oh. Well,

368
00:16:57,187 --> 00:16:59,287
- thank you for being honest.
- Yeah. You know,

369
00:16:59,289 --> 00:17:00,755
I want to be upset, but we did

370
00:17:00,757 --> 00:17:02,223
kind of have fun
working on the prototype.

371
00:17:02,225 --> 00:17:04,392
Don't forgive them!
Stay mad at them!

372
00:17:05,795 --> 00:17:07,862
What is he doing
in there?

373
00:17:07,864 --> 00:17:10,998
Busting you!

374
00:17:12,268 --> 00:17:13,668
It's okay.
They apologized.

375
00:17:13,670 --> 00:17:14,836
Yeah, it's fine.

376
00:17:14,838 --> 00:17:18,973
Well this is kind
of anti-climactic.

377
00:17:19,976 --> 00:17:21,576
You know what
wasn't anti-climactic?

378
00:17:21,578 --> 00:17:23,277
The end of the movie. Get this.

379
00:17:23,279 --> 00:17:25,346
No spoilers! No spoilers!

380
00:17:26,216 --> 00:17:28,382
And he's back
in the closet.

381
00:17:29,752 --> 00:17:32,320
Ready for dinner?

382
00:17:32,322 --> 00:17:34,522
Yeah.

383
00:17:36,526 --> 00:17:38,259
Should we invite Raj?

384
00:17:38,261 --> 00:17:40,595
Yes.

385
00:17:42,765 --> 00:17:45,032
So, no one else knows
about this?

386
00:17:45,034 --> 00:17:47,235
Only you.

387
00:17:48,838 --> 00:17:51,439
Thank you for trusting me.

388
00:17:51,441 --> 00:17:53,441
What good is having
a girlfriend

389
00:17:53,443 --> 00:17:56,177
if you can't unload your
psychological sewage on her?

390
00:17:57,580 --> 00:18:00,181
That's me,
your emotional outhouse.

391
00:18:01,918 --> 00:18:03,818
You know,

392
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:07,488
if you ever decide you want
to do something about this,

393
00:18:07,490 --> 00:18:09,157
I'm-I'm here for you.

394
00:18:09,159 --> 00:18:11,425
Thank you.

395
00:18:11,427 --> 00:18:13,728
I wouldn't even know
how to begin.

396
00:18:13,730 --> 00:18:16,364
Baby steps, I guess.

397
00:18:16,366 --> 00:18:18,833
Mm.

398
00:18:25,308 --> 00:18:28,442
I suppose I could try
getting rid of the golf ball.

399
00:18:29,245 --> 00:18:31,179
Oh. Okay.

400
00:18:32,182 --> 00:18:35,016
I will always have the dent
to remember it by.

401
00:18:50,667 --> 00:18:52,366
You did it.

402
00:18:52,368 --> 00:18:54,569
Do you feel okay?

403
00:18:55,605 --> 00:18:57,772
Actually, yes.

404
00:18:58,975 --> 00:19:00,408
I do.

405
00:19:01,311 --> 00:19:03,110
Well, I'm proud of you.

406
00:19:03,112 --> 00:19:05,313
Oh. Thanks.

407
00:19:22,295 --> 00:19:26,030
I'm glad I told you
about the storage unit.

408
00:19:26,032 --> 00:19:27,932
Well, I feel closer to you now.

409
00:19:28,587 --> 00:19:30,754
Oh, I feel closer to you, too.

410
00:19:30,756 --> 00:19:32,022
You know,

411
00:19:32,024 --> 00:19:35,659
it's still a couple
of hours until my bedtime.

412
00:19:42,434 --> 00:19:45,068
What did you have in mind?

413
00:19:45,070 --> 00:19:47,504
You look amazing.

414
00:19:50,976 --> 00:19:55,545
I mean,
this resolution is remarkable.

415
00:19:56,482 --> 00:20:00,017
I really had to go home
for this?

416
00:20:00,019 --> 00:20:04,354
Yes, but it's like
you're right here in the room.

417
00:20:04,356 --> 00:20:07,457
And yet, I'm not.

418
00:20:07,459 --> 00:20:11,028
But I feel like I could
reach out and touch you.

419
00:20:11,030 --> 00:20:13,196
And yet, you can't.

420
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,867
I know!

421
00:20:19,685 --> 00:20:26,185
