Hey, Thursday can't
get here soon enough.

32
00:02:12,878 --> 00:02:15,379
I'm taking off work
to watch the original trilogy

33
00:02:15,382 --> 00:02:19,850
while I eat enough Star Wars
cereal to choke a Wookiee.

34
00:02:19,853 --> 00:02:23,353
Uh, sweetie, you do realize
Thursday is Amy's birthday.

35
00:02:23,355 --> 00:02:25,923
And you do realize
I bought my ticket

36
00:02:25,925 --> 00:02:27,724
when Amy and I were broken up?

37
00:02:29,194 --> 00:02:31,361
I hope you didn't need anything
in that case,

38
00:02:31,364 --> 00:02:32,796
'cause it's closed.

39
00:02:32,799 --> 00:02:35,165
You guys just got back together.

40
00:02:35,168 --> 00:02:37,335
You might not want
to ditch her on her birthday.

41
00:02:37,336 --> 00:02:39,603
I think Penny has a point.
You can see it another day.

42
00:02:39,605 --> 00:02:41,605
But someone might
spoil the movie.

43
00:02:41,608 --> 00:02:43,674

Amy's birthday for me.

Surprise! She's even older.

45
00:02:44,978 --> 00:02:47,277

46
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,079
Oh, that's nice.

47
00:02:49,081 --> 00:02:51,549
Put that on her cake.

48
00:03:01,227 --> 00:03:04,162
Oh, great. This again.

49
00:03:04,163 --> 00:03:07,899
Arthur, what brings you back?

50
00:03:07,901 --> 00:03:10,134
Uh, beats me. I-I just...

51
00:03:10,135 --> 00:03:12,736
hope this isn't a-a sex dream.

52
00:03:14,574 --> 00:03:16,507
In the past, you've come to me

53
00:03:16,509 --> 00:03:18,341
when I'm struggling
with a dilemma.

54
00:03:18,343 --> 00:03:21,512
And-and the one time where...
where you were afraid,

55
00:03:21,514 --> 00:03:25,817
and you needed me for...
for a night light.

56
00:03:27,454 --> 00:03:29,319
What's-what's troubling you?

57
00:03:30,189 --> 00:03:31,889
Well...

58
00:03:31,890 --> 00:03:33,858
my friends are telling me

59
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:36,293
I shouldn't abandon
my girlfriend on her birthday

60
00:03:36,295 --> 00:03:39,096
to see the new Star Wars movie.

61
00:03:39,098 --> 00:03:41,498
Well, sounds right.

62
00:03:42,868 --> 00:03:45,336
Can... can I get out of this...

63
00:03:45,337 --> 00:03:48,239
muumuu now?

64
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:50,307
Those are the robes of the Jedi,

65
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:53,243
the guardians of peace
and justice in the galaxy.

66
00:03:53,246 --> 00:03:57,448
And they... they-they don't wear
underwear.

67
00:04:02,388 --> 00:04:04,622
So, you agree with my friends

68
00:04:04,623 --> 00:04:06,824
that I should skip the premiere?

69
00:04:06,825 --> 00:04:10,461
Uh, do... do you
love this girl?

70
00:04:10,462 --> 00:04:12,396
Yes.

71
00:04:12,398 --> 00:04:15,665
But she knows how important
Star Wars is to me.

72
00:04:15,668 --> 00:04:17,968
Well, maybe
you should show her how...

73
00:04:17,971 --> 00:04:20,805
how important she is to you.

74
00:04:20,807 --> 00:04:24,574
By seeing the movie
she'd want me to see?

75
00:04:25,745 --> 00:04:28,980
Sheldon, you-you can see
this movie whenever you want.

76
00:04:29,882 --> 00:04:33,183
But you only have
a limited number of days

77
00:04:33,185 --> 00:04:36,319
that you-you can be
with this woman.

78
00:04:36,322 --> 00:04:38,154
Be with her.

79
00:04:39,992 --> 00:04:41,925
You're right.

80
00:04:41,927 --> 00:04:43,593
Great.

81
00:04:44,463 --> 00:04:46,430
Where are you going?

82
00:04:46,432 --> 00:04:51,334
I don't know, but hopefully,
somewhere I can wear pants.

83
00:05:00,579 --> 00:05:02,579
Sheldon, what's wrong?

84
00:05:02,581 --> 00:05:06,117
I wanted to let you know I'll be
spending your birthday with you.

85
00:05:06,985 --> 00:05:09,120
Okay.

86
00:05:09,122 --> 00:05:12,423
See, I-I had tickets to the
Star Wars premiere that night,

87
00:05:12,425 --> 00:05:14,858
but Professor Proton came to me
in a dream dressed as

88
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:17,961
Obi-Wan Kenobi and convinced me
I should be with you.

89
00:05:18,798 --> 00:05:20,697
Obi-what?

90
00:05:20,699 --> 00:05:23,634
I'll-I'll let you get back
to sleep now. Good night.

91
00:05:23,636 --> 00:05:25,101
Okay. Good night. Wait.

92
00:05:25,103 --> 00:05:26,536
Um, Sheldon,

93
00:05:26,538 --> 00:05:29,473
were you actually not gonna
spend my birthday with me?

94
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:34,077
It's late. Got to go. Bye.

95
00:05:35,247 --> 00:05:36,547
Good for Sheldon deciding

96
00:05:36,548 --> 00:05:38,848
to stay with Amy on her birthday.
I know.

97
00:05:38,850 --> 00:05:40,817
It's still gonna be weird
to see the movie without him.

98
00:05:40,819 --> 00:05:44,788
Well, we could wait a
couple days and see it together.

99
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:50,093
Hello.

100
00:05:50,096 --> 00:05:51,995
Hey. We're going to the comic
book store. You want to come?

101
00:05:51,997 --> 00:05:53,430
No, I can't.

102
00:05:53,432 --> 00:05:55,565
I need to make preparations
for Amy's birthday.

103
00:05:55,567 --> 00:05:56,701
Which leads me

104
00:05:56,702 --> 00:05:58,836
to the following bit
of business.

105
00:05:58,838 --> 00:06:01,072
This is my ticket to Star Wars.

106
00:06:01,074 --> 00:06:03,608
I don't have to tell you
it is worth far more

107
00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:07,244
than its face value
of $15.50.

108
00:06:07,245 --> 00:06:09,980
I trust you'll give it
to someone worthy.

109
00:06:09,983 --> 00:06:11,281
You got it.

110
00:06:11,283 --> 00:06:12,882
Well, Penny might
want to join us.

111
00:06:12,884 --> 00:06:16,319
This is my ticket
to Star Wars.

112
00:06:17,389 --> 00:06:18,689
Penny.

113
00:06:18,690 --> 00:06:19,856
Penny?

114
00:06:19,858 --> 00:06:20,992
Penny?

115
00:06:20,994 --> 00:06:23,360
What happens if
I say, “Come in”?

116
00:06:23,362 --> 00:06:25,028
Well, find out.

117
00:06:25,031 --> 00:06:26,363
Come in!

118
00:06:29,668 --> 00:06:31,636
Bernadette?

119
00:06:31,637 --> 00:06:33,637
Bernadette?
Bernadette?

120
00:06:33,639 --> 00:06:35,906
Come in!

121
00:06:35,908 --> 00:06:37,942
Keep it up.

122
00:06:37,944 --> 00:06:39,976
I got nowhere else to be.

123
00:06:39,978 --> 00:06:41,946
Just come in.

124
00:06:43,081 --> 00:06:45,682
For future reference,
if I want to watch Mean Girls,

125
00:06:45,685 --> 00:06:48,151
I'll stream it on Netflix.

126
00:06:48,153 --> 00:06:50,286
We're sorry.
What do you need?

127
00:06:50,288 --> 00:06:51,656
Well, as you know,

128
00:06:51,658 --> 00:06:53,658
I'll be celebrating
Amy's birthday with her,

129
00:06:53,659 --> 00:06:54,891
and I could use your assistance

130
00:06:54,894 --> 00:06:56,761
in helping me select
the perfect gift.

131
00:06:56,762 --> 00:06:58,295
Sure.
Well, so far,

132
00:06:58,297 --> 00:06:59,730
I've come up with three ideas.

133
00:06:59,732 --> 00:07:01,331
The first is a chance for her

134
00:07:01,334 --> 00:07:03,166
to play the harp
with the L.A. Philharmonic.

135
00:07:03,168 --> 00:07:04,901
Wow. You can really
arrange that?

136
00:07:04,903 --> 00:07:06,437
Well, I said a chance,
you know.

137
00:07:06,439 --> 00:07:07,872
When you tell them
it's your birthday

138
00:07:07,874 --> 00:07:09,273
at Bennigan's,
they make a fuss.

139
00:07:09,274 --> 00:07:11,542
I don't see why the Philharmonic
would be any different.

140
00:07:12,444 --> 00:07:14,812
How about something
a little more realistic?

141
00:07:14,814 --> 00:07:17,415
Well, Amy enjoys
knitting her own sweaters,

142
00:07:17,417 --> 00:07:20,216
so I was thinking of getting her
an all-expense-paid trip

143
00:07:20,218 --> 00:07:23,053
to the Wisconsin Sheep
and Wool Festival.

144
00:07:25,792 --> 00:07:28,826
Sorry. I was waiting
for the bazinga.

145
00:07:29,528 --> 00:07:31,028
Hold on. It could be romantic.

146
00:07:31,029 --> 00:07:32,463
The two of them away together,

147
00:07:32,465 --> 00:07:35,331
keeping each other warm
in snowy Wisconsin.

148
00:07:35,334 --> 00:07:36,867
No, no, no, no.
She'd be going alone.

149
00:07:36,869 --> 00:07:38,536
Well, if you think
I'm afraid of birds,

150
00:07:38,538 --> 00:07:39,836
you should see me around sheep.

151
00:07:39,838 --> 00:07:42,072
Okay, well,
what's the third option?

152
00:07:42,074 --> 00:07:43,540
That I have coitus with her.

153
00:07:51,951 --> 00:07:54,851
What do you think about giving
Sheldon's ticket to Stuart?

154
00:07:54,853 --> 00:07:56,387
I don't know.

155
00:07:56,389 --> 00:07:58,855
Have you ever seen a movie
with Stuart before?

156
00:07:58,858 --> 00:08:01,391
It's like going
with your grandpa.

157
00:08:01,394 --> 00:08:02,793
Instead of eating popcorn,

158
00:08:02,795 --> 00:08:05,028
he brings little pieces
of chicken in Tupperware

159
00:08:05,031 --> 00:08:07,430
and a thermos full of soup.

160
00:08:07,432 --> 00:08:09,466
He's not that bad.

161
00:08:09,468 --> 00:08:12,536
Hey, Stuart, got any plans
Thursday night?

162
00:08:12,538 --> 00:08:15,238
My, uh... my doctor's worried
about my circulation,

163
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:18,108
so I was thinking about
walking around the mall.

164
00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:19,744
Why?

165
00:08:19,745 --> 00:08:21,911
Well...
Hey, you guys.

166
00:08:21,913 --> 00:08:23,547
Oh, make sure
to wear sensible shoes.

167
00:08:23,548 --> 00:08:25,783
Wil, want to go
to Star Wars Thursday?

168
00:08:25,785 --> 00:08:26,917
Absolutely.

169
00:08:26,918 --> 00:08:28,485
Fine, take Wil.

170
00:08:28,488 --> 00:08:30,754
See if he brings you
clam chowder.

171
00:08:32,924 --> 00:08:34,692
Okay, okay, okay,
okay, okay.

172
00:08:34,693 --> 00:08:36,659
Let's-let's... let's just
recap our options.

173
00:08:36,662 --> 00:08:39,864
All right, we've got
harp thing, sheep thing...

174
00:08:39,865 --> 00:08:41,664
Wild thang.

175
00:08:44,403 --> 00:08:46,236
Which do you think
she'd prefer?

176
00:08:46,239 --> 00:08:50,006
Because I checked the Sheep
and Wool Festival Web site,

177
00:08:50,009 --> 00:08:52,475
and there's only
8,000 tickets left.

178
00:08:54,413 --> 00:08:57,313
Sheldon, being physical with
Amy is a huge step for you.

179
00:08:57,316 --> 00:08:59,115
Yeah, are you ready
for this?

180
00:08:59,118 --> 00:09:02,385
Intimacy in any form
has been challenging for me,

181
00:09:02,388 --> 00:09:05,022
but I'd like to show her
how important she is,

182
00:09:05,024 --> 00:09:07,892
and it feels like
now might be the right time.

183
00:09:07,894 --> 00:09:09,659
Sheldon, that's
so beautiful.

184
00:09:09,662 --> 00:09:11,495
Then it's settled.

185
00:09:11,496 --> 00:09:14,164
Amy's birthday present
will be my genitals.

186
00:09:23,793 --> 00:09:25,192
Thanks for taking me out.

187
00:09:25,193 --> 00:09:27,260
Well, you're spending
your birthday with Sheldon.

188
00:09:27,263 --> 00:09:28,394
Why not celebrate early?

189
00:09:28,397 --> 00:09:30,197
So where do
you want to go?

190
00:09:30,198 --> 00:09:32,732
I heard that new Mexican place
on Green Street is good.

191
00:09:32,735 --> 00:09:37,071
Sure, sure. Or we could
take you to get a bikini wax.

192
00:09:38,673 --> 00:09:42,143
Why would I get a bikini
wax for my birthday?

193
00:09:42,144 --> 00:09:44,912
Uh, I don't know.
It was just a thought.

194
00:09:44,913 --> 00:09:46,980
I think I'll just
stick to Mexican.

195
00:09:46,982 --> 00:09:51,152
Great. And then maybe after,
we can watch a dirty movie,

196
00:09:51,153 --> 00:09:53,988
and if anybody has any questions
about what happened or how,

197
00:09:53,990 --> 00:09:56,322
we can answer them.

198
00:09:57,225 --> 00:09:59,527
Okay, what
is going on?

199
00:09:59,528 --> 00:10:01,562
Oh, we just want you
to be prepared

200
00:10:01,563 --> 00:10:03,898
for any surprises
that might happen tomorrow.

201
00:10:03,899 --> 00:10:06,033
What surprises?

202
00:10:06,034 --> 00:10:07,967
Oh.

203
00:10:07,970 --> 00:10:10,236
We don't want to
spoil anything,

204
00:10:10,239 --> 00:10:15,176
but you should know that Sheldon
said he's ready to be physical.

205
00:10:15,177 --> 00:10:17,677
You shut your damn mouth!

206
00:10:21,317 --> 00:10:24,051
You actually heard him say this?

207
00:10:24,052 --> 00:10:25,351
Yes. He said he wants
to do something

208
00:10:25,354 --> 00:10:26,787
to show you how much
you mean to him.

209
00:10:26,788 --> 00:10:31,357
I-I can't believe it. I...

210
00:10:32,761 --> 00:10:35,062
I don't know what to say.

211
00:10:35,063 --> 00:10:36,931
Well, we're really
happy for you,

212
00:10:36,932 --> 00:10:38,631
and we know how
much he cares...

213
00:10:38,634 --> 00:10:40,400
I do know what to say!
Let's get me waxed!

214
00:10:49,845 --> 00:10:54,114
Why isn't it ever
Angie Dickinson's bedroom?

215
00:10:55,183 --> 00:10:56,850
You're back.

216
00:10:56,851 --> 00:11:01,054
It-it doesn't seem
like it's up to me.

217
00:11:01,057 --> 00:11:03,624
I suppose you're here because...

218
00:11:03,625 --> 00:11:06,860
I've decided to be physical
with my girlfriend,

219
00:11:06,861 --> 00:11:09,529
and I've never done that before.

220
00:11:09,532 --> 00:11:13,667
E-Excuse me for a moment.

221
00:11:29,284 --> 00:11:32,119
Well, it was worth a shot.

222
00:11:33,956 --> 00:11:36,923
So, can you help me?

223
00:11:36,926 --> 00:11:39,460
Uh, all right. Um...

224
00:11:39,461 --> 00:11:42,929
once-once the man gets

225
00:11:42,932 --> 00:11:45,899
the-the woman out of her...
out of her bloomers...

226
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:48,902
Oh, no.
Not that.

227
00:11:48,903 --> 00:11:51,404
I-I understand
the mechanics.

228
00:11:51,407 --> 00:11:53,706
Oh, good, good. 'Cause, uh,

229
00:11:53,709 --> 00:11:57,510
I have no idea
what kids these days are...

230
00:11:57,513 --> 00:12:00,947
calling their-their parts.

231
00:12:03,085 --> 00:12:05,753
I think they say “junk.”

232
00:12:07,123 --> 00:12:09,956
What is happening to this world?

233
00:12:11,192 --> 00:12:15,328
What-what do you
actually need to know?

234
00:12:16,765 --> 00:12:19,265
This is an important night
for us,

235
00:12:19,268 --> 00:12:22,034
and I'm worried
I might be overwhelmed

236
00:12:22,037 --> 00:12:24,370
and ruin everything.

237
00:12:25,541 --> 00:12:29,143
Sheldon, if-if you're
with the right person,

238
00:12:29,144 --> 00:12:31,778
it-it'll be okay.

239
00:12:34,115 --> 00:12:36,383
Thank you, Arthur.

240
00:12:36,384 --> 00:12:39,552
You are the wisest of the wise.

241
00:12:39,554 --> 00:12:42,221
Well, that's-that's very nice
of you to say,

242
00:12:42,224 --> 00:12:44,825
but I think
I'm just an expression of...

243
00:12:44,826 --> 00:12:47,794
of your unconscious mind.

244
00:12:47,797 --> 00:12:50,364
Oh, sure. Yeah.

245
00:12:50,365 --> 00:12:54,467
Well, you're fun to look at.

246
00:12:58,039 --> 00:12:59,405
Tonight's the night!

247
00:12:59,408 --> 00:13:01,375
Yeah, the wait
is finally over!

248
00:13:01,376 --> 00:13:04,577
I know. Then you'll finally stop
talking about it!

249
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:06,580
Ready to go?
Let's do this.

250
00:13:06,581 --> 00:13:07,735
Have fun, guys!

251
00:13:07,735 --> 00:13:09,917
We will.
I can't believe Sheldon gave this up.

252
00:13:09,918 --> 00:13:10,607
I know.

253
00:13:10,631 --> 00:13:12,587
We're gonna have
so much more fun than him.

254
00:13:15,291 --> 00:13:17,857
No, they're not.

255
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:21,260
Knowing them, they will.

256
00:13:25,467 --> 00:13:28,067
T minus 15 minutes!

257
00:13:28,070 --> 00:13:29,369
Oh, did you hear
from Wil?

258
00:13:29,370 --> 00:13:31,738
Yeah, he's on his way.
Time for bladder check.

259
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:33,139
Check.

260
00:13:33,142 --> 00:13:34,408
Check.

261
00:13:34,409 --> 00:13:36,976
Check. Wait.

262
00:13:38,179 --> 00:13:40,147
Screw it. I'm holding it.

263
00:13:41,484 --> 00:13:43,250
What is everyone
booing at?

264
00:13:49,859 --> 00:13:51,357
Hey, guys. What's up?

265
00:13:52,461 --> 00:13:54,695
Um, hey, Wil.
What you doin'?

266
00:13:54,697 --> 00:13:57,865
I was on Star Trek. I'm just
rooting for the home team.

267
00:13:57,866 --> 00:13:59,666
Star Trek stinks!

268
00:13:59,668 --> 00:14:02,936
Yeah? Live long
and suck it!

269
00:14:09,544 --> 00:14:11,477
Birthday girl.

270
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:14,748
Birthday girl.
Birthday girl.

271
00:14:17,219 --> 00:14:18,784
Come in!

272
00:14:18,787 --> 00:14:21,554
Oh!

273
00:14:26,629 --> 00:14:27,661
Hi, Sheldon.

274
00:14:27,663 --> 00:14:29,129
Hello. Sorry I'm late.

275
00:14:29,130 --> 00:14:30,730
I also got you a balloon,

276
00:14:30,732 --> 00:14:33,432
but it floated away,
and I chased it for a while.

277
00:14:33,434 --> 00:14:36,036
That's okay. Come on in.

278
00:14:36,038 --> 00:14:37,336
Thank you.
Mm-hmm.

279
00:14:37,338 --> 00:14:40,240
Um, I'll... I'm gonna go put
these in water.

280
00:14:40,241 --> 00:14:41,908
Okay.

281
00:14:41,911 --> 00:14:44,544
Ooh, this is different, hmm?

282
00:14:44,547 --> 00:14:46,346
Candles and music.

283
00:14:46,347 --> 00:14:47,847
Do you like it?

284
00:14:47,850 --> 00:14:50,082
It's kind of spooky.

285
00:14:50,085 --> 00:14:51,851
I can change it back.

286
00:14:51,854 --> 00:14:53,386
No, no, no. It's your birthday.

287
00:14:53,389 --> 00:14:57,090
As long as no one jumps out
in a hockey mask, I'll be fine.

288
00:15:00,763 --> 00:15:03,230
So...

289
00:15:04,533 --> 00:15:06,966
What'd you have in mind
for tonight?

290
00:15:06,969 --> 00:15:09,669
I thought I could take you out
to a nice birthday dinner.

291
00:15:09,672 --> 00:15:14,073
If we pick a place east of here,
we might find the balloon.

292
00:15:14,076 --> 00:15:17,110
Um, that sounds nice, but...

293
00:15:17,111 --> 00:15:20,080
I'm not really hungry right now.

294
00:15:20,081 --> 00:15:22,716
I thought maybe...

295
00:15:22,717 --> 00:15:26,352
we could do presents first.
Oh.

296
00:15:27,221 --> 00:15:28,855
All right.

297
00:15:28,856 --> 00:15:30,957
Um...

298
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:34,760
I should probably tell you
something about this gift.

299
00:15:34,763 --> 00:15:38,764
You mean before you...

300
00:15:38,767 --> 00:15:41,969
give it to me?

301
00:15:44,038 --> 00:15:46,340
Yes.

302
00:15:46,341 --> 00:15:50,210
May I ask you a question
before I...

303
00:15:50,211 --> 00:15:53,046
give it to you?

304
00:15:53,048 --> 00:15:55,816
Of course.
Why are we saying

305
00:15:55,817 --> 00:15:58,451
“give it to you” like that?

306
00:15:58,453 --> 00:16:01,153
Sheldon,

307
00:16:01,155 --> 00:16:04,490
I know your present is...

308
00:16:04,493 --> 00:16:08,427
for us to be intimate tonight.

309
00:16:08,429 --> 00:16:10,831
I see.

310
00:16:10,832 --> 00:16:12,566
Is that all right?

311
00:16:18,072 --> 00:16:20,440
I'm sorry,
but this is a litigious society.

312
00:16:20,442 --> 00:16:22,975
I'm gonna need verbal consent.

313
00:16:24,779 --> 00:16:26,980
Yes.

314
00:16:28,317 --> 00:16:31,518
You know what, let me pull a
quick contract off the Internet.

315
00:16:36,491 --> 00:16:39,826
So, if you don't like Star
Wars, why are you here?

316
00:16:39,827 --> 00:16:40,961
Oh, I'm just having fun.

317
00:16:40,962 --> 00:16:42,796
Everyone takes Star
Wars so seriously.

318
00:16:42,798 --> 00:16:45,665
Like if the movie's bad,
it's gonna ruin their lives.

319
00:16:45,668 --> 00:16:47,400
Is it bad?
Did you hear something?

320
00:16:47,403 --> 00:16:50,770
Oh, my God. It's bad.
Somebody kill me.

321
00:16:50,773 --> 00:16:53,340
See? That's
what I mean.

322
00:16:53,341 --> 00:16:55,241
When you wake up in the
morning, whether this is

323
00:16:55,244 --> 00:16:57,376
the greatest movie ever
or a total piece of crap,

324
00:16:57,379 --> 00:16:58,979
your life isn't
gonna change at all.

325
00:16:59,847 --> 00:17:01,882
He's right.

326
00:17:01,884 --> 00:17:03,083
Yeah.

327
00:17:03,085 --> 00:17:04,651
No matter what happens,

328
00:17:04,653 --> 00:17:06,787
we're coming back tomorrow
to watch it again.

329
00:17:09,324 --> 00:17:11,692
Do you think Sheldon's actually
gonna go through with it?

330
00:17:11,693 --> 00:17:12,893
I don't know.

331
00:17:12,894 --> 00:17:15,295
He said he's ready.
Yeah, but he also swore

332
00:17:15,297 --> 00:17:17,864
this was the year he'd be able
to pull the guts out

333
00:17:17,865 --> 00:17:19,932
of a pumpkin.

334
00:17:19,934 --> 00:17:22,001
Well, I'm gonna stay positive.
I mean, we talked.

335
00:17:22,003 --> 00:17:24,471
I told him what women like,
and after he stopped giggling,

336
00:17:24,472 --> 00:17:26,873
he seemed pretty sure
of himself.

337
00:17:39,755 --> 00:17:41,153
Hi.

338
00:17:41,155 --> 00:17:43,355
Hello.

339
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:47,728
So, um...

340
00:17:47,730 --> 00:17:50,663
should I get under the covers
with you?

341
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:53,767
All right.

342
00:18:13,888 --> 00:18:16,123
Hello.
Hi!

343
00:18:18,926 --> 00:18:21,894
Why are you shaking?
Are you cold?

344
00:18:21,896 --> 00:18:25,365
I'm just, um... really nervous.

345
00:18:25,366 --> 00:18:26,833
Why?

346
00:18:26,835 --> 00:18:29,469
Well...

347
00:18:29,471 --> 00:18:31,904
I've been waiting for this
for so long,

348
00:18:31,906 --> 00:18:35,575
I've just... built it up
in my head.

349
00:18:35,576 --> 00:18:38,478
I don't know
what to expect.

350
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:41,515
Neither do I.

351
00:18:41,517 --> 00:18:46,153
But... we can find out
together.

352
00:18:47,955 --> 00:18:50,156
Okay.

353
00:18:56,898 --> 00:19:00,066
I'm really nervous.

354
00:19:00,935 --> 00:19:02,335
I know.

355
00:19:02,336 --> 00:19:05,538
We've been waiting so long
for this.

356
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:09,709
And we've built it up
in our heads so much.

357
00:19:09,711 --> 00:19:12,645
Guys, it's
just a movie.

358
00:19:12,647 --> 00:19:14,146
That's true.

359
00:19:14,148 --> 00:19:15,816
He's right.
It is.

360
00:19:15,817 --> 00:19:19,952
Although, we all
remember Jar Jar.

361
00:19:19,954 --> 00:19:23,557
Leonard,
I-I'm scared again.

362
00:19:29,096 --> 00:19:33,165
Well, I enjoyed that
more than I thought I would.

363
00:19:39,974 --> 00:19:43,242
Me, too.

364
00:19:43,244 --> 00:19:48,448
I look forward to your next
birthday when we do it again.

365
00:19:49,884 --> 00:19:52,152
That works for me.

366
00:19:52,153 --> 00:19:55,788
I enjoyed that
more than I thought I would.

367
00:19:58,594 --> 00:20:02,796
I don't think
I can walk right now.

368
00:20:10,884 --> 00:20:13,551
Uh, Sheldon?

369
00:20:13,554 --> 00:20:15,586
Sheldon.

370
00:20:15,588 --> 00:20:16,855
Arthur.

371
00:20:16,856 --> 00:20:18,222
What are you
doing here?

372
00:20:18,224 --> 00:20:19,257
I-I don't think

373
00:20:19,259 --> 00:20:21,893
I need any more advice.

374
00:20:21,894 --> 00:20:24,496
I-I was just curious.

375
00:20:25,665 --> 00:20:29,134
How-How'd it go?

376
00:20:29,135 --> 00:20:30,902
Oh.

377
00:20:33,574 --> 00:20:35,240
It was amazing.

378
00:20:36,009 --> 00:20:37,541
I-I saw it a few days later.

379
00:20:37,544 --> 00:20:39,845
What a movie.

380
00:20:44,017 --> 00:20:46,917
But, uh, what-what about Amy?

381
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:49,921
Oh. Uh, uh, she liked it fine.

382
00:20:49,923 --> 00:20:54,425
But she doesn't have the history
with the franchise I do.

383
00:20:55,261 --> 00:20:57,761
Okay.

384
00:20:57,763 --> 00:21:00,332
Good... good talk.

385
00:21:02,172 --> 00:21:08,672
