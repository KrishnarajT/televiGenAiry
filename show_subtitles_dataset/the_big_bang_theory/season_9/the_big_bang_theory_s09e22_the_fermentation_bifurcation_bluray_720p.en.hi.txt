1
00:00:00,354 --> 00:00:02,188
I won a night of
wine tasting from work.

2
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:03,689
That sounds fun.
Mm-hmm.

3
00:00:03,691 --> 00:00:07,092
How come scientists don't win
free stuff like salespeople do?

4
00:00:07,094 --> 00:00:08,761
'Cause we're not in it
for the stuff.

5
00:00:08,763 --> 00:00:11,464
We're in it
for the groupies.

6
00:00:11,466 --> 00:00:12,731
Personally,

7
00:00:12,733 --> 00:00:15,534
I find the notion of
external rewards demeaning.

8
00:00:15,536 --> 00:00:18,838
I pursue science for the
intrinsic joy of discovery.

9
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:21,740
But you always say that
you want to win a Nobel Prize.

10
00:00:21,742 --> 00:00:24,210
I also say don't contradict
me in front of my friends,

11
00:00:24,212 --> 00:00:25,478
but that you
don't remember.

12
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:28,547
All right, well, let me know
if you guys want to go.

13
00:00:28,549 --> 00:00:29,748
I would love to.

14
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:32,885
I do enjoy the complexity
of an aged Pinot noir.

15
00:00:32,887 --> 00:00:34,186
I'm sure that would pair nicely

16
00:00:34,188 --> 00:00:36,121
with your fried nuggets
of chicken.

17
00:00:37,892 --> 00:00:39,992
Well, it sounds like
a nice night. We should go.

18
00:00:39,994 --> 00:00:41,060
Wine again?

19
00:00:41,062 --> 00:00:42,294
Yeah, no, thank you.

20
00:00:42,296 --> 00:00:44,196
I like my grapes
the old-fashioned way:

21
00:00:44,198 --> 00:00:46,532
in a juice box.

22
00:00:46,534 --> 00:00:47,900
Well, I'm going.

23
00:00:47,902 --> 00:00:49,902
You couldn't stop me from
getting a massage at the mall,

24
00:00:49,904 --> 00:00:51,570
and you're not stopping me now.

25
00:00:51,572 --> 00:00:53,339
I shouldn't have to
see my girlfriend

26
00:00:53,341 --> 00:00:55,174
get groped in public
by another man.

27
00:00:55,176 --> 00:00:57,743
And I shouldn't
have to see my boyfriend

28
00:00:57,745 --> 00:01:00,379
riding on a train for children
around the mall.

29
00:01:01,983 --> 00:01:03,983
The little choo-choo
for toddlers?

30
00:01:03,985 --> 00:01:06,051
And now you know why
I needed the massage.

31
00:01:07,622 --> 00:01:08,821
Well, we're out.

32
00:01:08,823 --> 00:01:10,623
Bernie can't drink
'cause she's pregnant.

33
00:01:10,625 --> 00:01:12,558
And she's pregnant
because we had sex.

34
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:13,993
And we had sex because...

35
00:01:13,995 --> 00:01:16,729
well, come on.

36
00:01:17,765 --> 00:01:19,798
It's okay.
You should go.

37
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:20,766
You sure?

38
00:01:20,768 --> 00:01:21,967
Of course.

39
00:01:21,969 --> 00:01:25,738
Yeah, give her a break from,
"Well, come on."

40
00:01:27,241 --> 00:01:29,608
Well, Bernadette, looks like
Saturday night, it's you and me.

41
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:32,411
Me? How? Why?

42
00:01:32,413 --> 00:01:34,079
Well, it makes perfect sense.

43
00:01:34,081 --> 00:01:36,882
Because you're an expectant
mother, you can't drink alcohol.

44
00:01:36,884 --> 00:01:37,850
I don't like to.

45
00:01:37,852 --> 00:01:39,218
You can't have sushi.

46
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:40,185
I don't like to.

47
00:01:40,187 --> 00:01:41,820
You can't go in hot tubs.

48
00:01:41,822 --> 00:01:44,990
I consider them
vats of sweaty people soup.

49
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:47,860
Gee, Sheldon, I don't know.

50
00:01:47,862 --> 00:01:49,261
Oh, come on.

51
00:01:49,263 --> 00:01:51,764
Roller coasters, caffeine,
runny eggs...

52
00:01:51,766 --> 00:01:53,599
I've been avoiding these things
all my life.

53
00:01:53,601 --> 00:01:56,869
And now, because you're
pregnant, you have to.

54
00:01:56,871 --> 00:01:59,004
The difference is she's
bringing life into the world,

55
00:01:59,006 --> 00:02:00,940
and you suck it out.

56
00:02:01,776 --> 00:02:03,742
I guess we could give it a try.

57
00:02:03,744 --> 00:02:06,312
Well, little lady,
you've heard of party hearty;

58
00:02:06,314 --> 00:02:08,914
get ready to party hardly.

59
00:02:10,151 --> 00:02:12,785
I bet you'd like

70
00:02:44,079 --> 00:02:45,679
Hey, you think
it'd be okay

71
00:02:45,681 --> 00:02:47,314
if I brought Claire
to the wine tasting?

72
00:02:47,316 --> 00:02:49,115
Sure. I'd like to meet her.
Oh, that's great.

73
00:02:49,117 --> 00:02:50,784
I've been wanting her
to meet you guys, too,

74
00:02:50,786 --> 00:02:52,419
so this seems like
the perfect opportunity.

75
00:02:52,421 --> 00:02:53,920
Oh, but I won't be there.

76
00:02:53,922 --> 00:02:55,255
Funny how that worked out.

77
00:02:56,658 --> 00:02:59,259
Does this mean Emily's not
in the picture anymore?

78
00:02:59,261 --> 00:03:00,327
No, I'm still dating her.

79
00:03:00,329 --> 00:03:01,495
Okay, help me out.

80
00:03:01,497 --> 00:03:02,829
How are you doing this?

81
00:03:02,831 --> 00:03:04,664
Do they know about each other?

82
00:03:04,666 --> 00:03:06,399
They know that
we're not exclusive,

83
00:03:06,401 --> 00:03:08,535
and we just don't ask
too many questions.

84
00:03:08,537 --> 00:03:11,171
You know, it's like how I play
Warlords of Ka'a with you

85
00:03:11,173 --> 00:03:14,941
and Elder Sign with
Frank and Alicia.

86
00:03:16,044 --> 00:03:17,511
Who's Frank and Alicia?

87
00:03:17,513 --> 00:03:19,946
Y... You and I spend
a lot of time together.

88
00:03:19,948 --> 00:03:22,549
Can there be a little
mystery between us?

89
00:03:22,551 --> 00:03:24,317
Okay.

90
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:26,086
Everything's hooked up.
We're ready.

91
00:03:26,088 --> 00:03:29,022
I am going to record
this for posterity.

92
00:03:29,024 --> 00:03:30,724
All right, here goes nothing.

93
00:03:30,726 --> 00:03:32,092
Here goes nothing?

94
00:03:32,094 --> 00:03:33,727
This is the initial test
of our prototype.

95
00:03:33,729 --> 00:03:35,328
Can we give it
a little more gravitas?

96
00:03:35,330 --> 00:03:36,496
Fine.

97
00:03:36,498 --> 00:03:39,299
Preliminary trial
of the infinite persistence

98
00:03:39,301 --> 00:03:42,369
gyroscopic navigational system:
phase one commencing.

99
00:03:42,371 --> 00:03:43,737
Eh... maybe it's your voice.

100
00:03:43,739 --> 00:03:46,573
I'm gonna see if I can get James
Earl Jones to do it in post.

101
00:03:51,213 --> 00:03:52,779
Ooh.

102
00:03:54,583 --> 00:03:56,283
Wow.

103
00:03:56,285 --> 00:03:58,919
It's... it's-it's beautiful.

104
00:04:01,223 --> 00:04:03,156
Actually,
it's making me dizzy.

105
00:04:03,158 --> 00:04:05,859
Good, it's not just me.

106
00:04:11,033 --> 00:04:12,198
Hello.

107
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,233
Hey, Claire.

108
00:04:13,235 --> 00:04:14,200
Hey, what's up?

109
00:04:14,202 --> 00:04:14,935
Hi, yeah.

110
00:04:14,937 --> 00:04:16,436
Um, I was wondering,

111
00:04:16,438 --> 00:04:18,605
if you're free Saturday night,

112
00:04:18,607 --> 00:04:20,907
all my friends are
going to a wine tasting.

113
00:04:20,909 --> 00:04:23,310
Sure, I guess.

114
00:04:23,312 --> 00:04:25,979
If you don't think meeting
your friends is too big a step.

115
00:04:25,981 --> 00:04:28,515
Why would it be too big a step?

116
00:04:28,517 --> 00:04:31,685
I don't know. I just don't
want things to get weird.

117
00:04:32,554 --> 00:04:34,754
Nothing to worry about.

118
00:04:34,756 --> 00:04:36,189
People meet people all the time,

119
00:04:36,191 --> 00:04:37,657
and it isn't weird.

120
00:04:37,659 --> 00:04:40,193
I met Bon Jovi once, which
you'd think might be weird.

121
00:04:40,195 --> 00:04:43,163
Turns out, total sweetheart.

122
00:04:43,165 --> 00:04:47,334
Okay, but you and I have been
keeping things casual.

123
00:04:47,336 --> 00:04:49,369
Uh, will you introduce me
as your friend

124
00:04:49,371 --> 00:04:50,537
or as your girlfriend?

125
00:04:50,539 --> 00:04:52,105
What if I like them

126
00:04:52,107 --> 00:04:53,239
and they don't like me?

127
00:04:53,241 --> 00:04:55,342
What if they like me
and I don't like them?

128
00:04:55,344 --> 00:04:58,178
Boy, it wasn't this hard
with Bon Jovi.

129
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:00,213
I said, "You rock,"
he said, "Thanks, man,"

130
00:05:00,215 --> 00:05:03,083
and that was that.

131
00:05:10,425 --> 00:05:11,825
Hey, you ready to go?

132
00:05:11,827 --> 00:05:13,760
Hang on.
What are you doing?

133
00:05:13,762 --> 00:05:17,597
Oh, I found a scratch-and-sniff
book about wine tasting.

134
00:05:18,634 --> 00:05:20,767
It teaches the different
flavor notes to look for.

135
00:05:20,769 --> 00:05:22,369
You actually smell the wine?

136
00:05:22,371 --> 00:05:24,938
I mostly just smell
my nasal spray.

137
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:27,007
Are your sinuses acting up?

138
00:05:27,009 --> 00:05:28,708
Since my preschool got a bunny.

139
00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:31,745
Hey, are you still hanging out
with Bernadette tonight?

140
00:05:31,747 --> 00:05:33,079
Yes.

141
00:05:33,081 --> 00:05:35,115
And we're going to prove
that we don't need alcohol

142
00:05:35,117 --> 00:05:36,149
to enjoy ourselves.

143
00:05:36,151 --> 00:05:37,484
Oh, good for you.

144
00:05:37,486 --> 00:05:39,419
Or caffeine, tobacco, sushi,

145
00:05:39,421 --> 00:05:42,088
soft cheese, processed meats
and Jacuzzis,

146
00:05:42,090 --> 00:05:44,691
which can all be harmful
to an unborn baby.

147
00:05:44,693 --> 00:05:48,161
No HoneyBaked Ham
in a hot tub... got it.

148
00:05:48,163 --> 00:05:49,496
Oh, no bubble baths either.

149
00:05:49,498 --> 00:05:51,631
They can increase the risk
of a urinary tract infection.

150
00:05:51,633 --> 00:05:52,899
Okay, have fun.

151
00:05:52,901 --> 00:05:55,802
Oh, and no swordfish, king
mackerel, shark or tilefish,

152
00:05:55,804 --> 00:05:57,337
which are all high in mercury.

153
00:05:57,339 --> 00:05:58,471
We're leaving now!

154
00:05:58,473 --> 00:05:59,673
Oh, and no contact with
guinea pigs

155
00:05:59,675 --> 00:06:00,974
or hamsters or their droppings,

156
00:06:00,976 --> 00:06:04,277
uh, no-no cat litter boxes,
no paint fumes...

157
00:06:04,279 --> 00:06:06,780
Okay, we're leaving,
love you, bye!

158
00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:10,650
Boy, do I love restrictions.

159
00:06:11,853 --> 00:06:14,287
Hey.

160
00:06:14,289 --> 00:06:15,321
Where is everybody?

161
00:06:15,323 --> 00:06:16,956
Oh, we're the first ones here.

162
00:06:16,958 --> 00:06:18,725
Oh.

163
00:06:18,727 --> 00:06:20,827
Cool.

164
00:06:20,829 --> 00:06:22,595
Yeah.

165
00:06:22,597 --> 00:06:24,030
Cool.

166
00:06:30,372 --> 00:06:31,838
You know, I don't
remember the last time

167
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,606
it was just you and me
hanging out.

168
00:06:33,608 --> 00:06:36,576
Oh, I do.
It was three years ago.

169
00:06:36,578 --> 00:06:40,013
Oh, yeah, and we said
we should do it more often.

170
00:06:40,015 --> 00:06:42,749
And-and here we are.

171
00:06:50,459 --> 00:06:52,492
So, Sheldon and Bernadette
are hanging out.

172
00:06:52,494 --> 00:06:55,862
I know. What are they
gonna talk about?

173
00:06:57,332 --> 00:06:59,432
I don't know.

174
00:06:59,434 --> 00:07:02,802
I really don't know.

175
00:07:02,804 --> 00:07:03,737
Hey.

176
00:07:03,739 --> 00:07:05,305
Oh, good!
Oh, thank God!

177
00:07:05,307 --> 00:07:07,574
You guys been here long?

178
00:07:07,576 --> 00:07:08,608
No, two minutes.

179
00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:11,411
But yes.

180
00:07:11,413 --> 00:07:12,445
Where's Claire?

181
00:07:12,447 --> 00:07:13,880
Oh, she's meeting us here.

182
00:07:13,882 --> 00:07:16,149
Hey, guys, do me a favor
and don't ask too many questions

183
00:07:16,151 --> 00:07:17,117
about the relationship.

184
00:07:17,119 --> 00:07:18,685
We're just keeping it casual.

185
00:07:18,687 --> 00:07:21,421
Oh, so I shouldn't ask her
how she feels about being

186
00:07:21,423 --> 00:07:23,590
a member of your harem?

187
00:07:23,592 --> 00:07:26,659
Yeah, I know you're teasing,
but watch out for karma.

188
00:07:26,661 --> 00:07:29,395
Hey, Penny, isn't that
your old boyfriend Zack?

189
00:07:29,397 --> 00:07:31,464
Oh, yeah.

190
00:07:31,466 --> 00:07:32,932
Are you gonna
say hi to him?

191
00:07:32,934 --> 00:07:34,067
Uh, I don't know.

192
00:07:34,069 --> 00:07:35,068
Hey, while you decide,

193
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:36,336
who was better in bed:

194
00:07:36,338 --> 00:07:39,773
big hot Zack
or wheezy little Leonard?

195
00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:44,911
Neener neener.

196
00:07:46,081 --> 00:07:47,680
I brought sparkling cider.

197
00:07:47,682 --> 00:07:50,884
Oh... the bubbles
tickle my nose.

198
00:07:50,886 --> 00:07:53,319
I'll just open this now
so it can get

199
00:07:53,321 --> 00:07:55,922
nice and flat
before we drink it.

200
00:07:55,924 --> 00:07:57,924
So what do you want
to do tonight?

201
00:07:57,926 --> 00:08:00,160
Oh, I have quite
the evening planned.

202
00:08:00,162 --> 00:08:03,463
Our fetus-friendly
festival of fun begins

203
00:08:03,465 --> 00:08:04,764
with an in-depth look

204
00:08:04,766 --> 00:08:06,699
at the world of model trains,

205
00:08:06,701 --> 00:08:09,002
and then we'll kick things
up a notch and explore

206
00:08:09,004 --> 00:08:12,138
all the different ways
that you can make toast.

207
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:14,107
There's more than one?

208
00:08:14,976 --> 00:08:16,943
You've heard of French toast?
Yeah.

209
00:08:16,945 --> 00:08:18,211
Cinnamon toast?
Yeah.

210
00:08:18,213 --> 00:08:19,445
Melba toast?
Yeah.

211
00:08:19,447 --> 00:08:21,681
You get where I'm going here?

212
00:08:21,683 --> 00:08:24,184
Yeah.

213
00:08:26,288 --> 00:08:29,122
I'm getting
an earthy note.

214
00:08:29,124 --> 00:08:31,057
Ah, there's
definitely some oak.

215
00:08:31,059 --> 00:08:33,326
Also, uh, cherries?

216
00:08:33,328 --> 00:08:35,261
I smell nothing.

217
00:08:36,565 --> 00:08:38,832
Really? Nothing?

218
00:08:38,834 --> 00:08:42,435
Just a... whole lot of Afrin.

219
00:08:42,437 --> 00:08:44,170
Penny?

220
00:08:44,172 --> 00:08:45,405
Oh. Zack, hi!

221
00:08:45,407 --> 00:08:46,673
You guys remember Zack.

222
00:08:46,675 --> 00:08:47,807
Yeah, hey, buddy.
- Hello. - Hey.

223
00:08:47,809 --> 00:08:49,676
Hey, did you two
get married?

224
00:08:49,678 --> 00:08:50,977
We did.
Yeah, mm-hmm.

225
00:08:50,979 --> 00:08:53,213
To each other?

226
00:08:54,482 --> 00:08:55,915
Yes.

227
00:08:55,917 --> 00:08:58,117
Cool. 'Cause other than
when you broke up with him

228
00:08:58,119 --> 00:08:59,819
and dated me, then
broke up with me,

229
00:08:59,821 --> 00:09:02,755
and then dated me one more
time before going back to him,

230
00:09:02,757 --> 00:09:04,724
I was always rooting
for you two.

231
00:09:04,726 --> 00:09:06,359
Thanks.

232
00:09:06,361 --> 00:09:07,861
So how's the
science world?

233
00:09:07,863 --> 00:09:09,295
What are you
guys up to?

234
00:09:09,297 --> 00:09:11,698
W-We've actually been
working on a prototype

235
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:13,233
for a navigation
system we invented.

236
00:09:13,235 --> 00:09:15,034
But we won't bore you
with the details.

237
00:09:15,036 --> 00:09:17,203
Are you kidding?
I love science.

238
00:09:17,205 --> 00:09:20,807
Einstein, Stephen Hawking,
Mike deGrasse Tyson.

239
00:09:21,676 --> 00:09:23,810
Mike deGrasse Tyson?

240
00:09:23,812 --> 00:09:26,512
Yeah, you know,
the boxer who grew a mustache

241
00:09:26,514 --> 00:09:29,115
and became a scientist.

242
00:09:29,117 --> 00:09:30,383
So what's your
invention?

243
00:09:30,385 --> 00:09:33,586
Well, we're using
quantum vortices

244
00:09:33,588 --> 00:09:35,788
to replace gyroscopes
in guidance systems.

245
00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:37,490
What's neat is
that they can maintain

246
00:09:37,492 --> 00:09:39,158
angular momentum indefinitely.

247
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:41,361
Angular momentum.

248
00:09:41,363 --> 00:09:43,830
I was wondering about that.

249
00:09:43,832 --> 00:09:47,600
You could put it in a
satellite or a rocket,

250
00:09:47,602 --> 00:09:49,369
and it'll run forever.

251
00:09:49,371 --> 00:09:50,637
Cool.

252
00:09:50,639 --> 00:09:53,006
Could it be used for
missiles and war stuff?

253
00:09:53,008 --> 00:09:56,242
Yeah, but we didn't
create it for weapons.

254
00:09:56,244 --> 00:09:58,244
And I doubt the military
would be interested

255
00:09:58,246 --> 00:09:59,612
in our little
guidance system.

256
00:09:59,614 --> 00:10:01,214
Is it better than
the one they use now?

257
00:10:01,216 --> 00:10:04,017
A lot!
Way better.

258
00:10:04,019 --> 00:10:05,752
Huh.

259
00:10:05,754 --> 00:10:08,288
You sure you guys are smart?

260
00:10:16,928 --> 00:10:20,396
"H-O" gauge trains
are 1/87 scale.

261
00:10:20,398 --> 00:10:23,599
"N" gauge are
1/160 scale.

262
00:10:23,601 --> 00:10:26,269
And that brings us
to "Z" gauge, at a

263
00:10:26,271 --> 00:10:31,074
"you could easily swallow it,
don't ask how I know," 1/220.

264
00:10:31,076 --> 00:10:33,242
I'm sorry, I have to ask.

265
00:10:33,244 --> 00:10:36,379
When I was five, I ingested
a "Z" gauge locomotive.

266
00:10:36,381 --> 00:10:38,815
I spent the next three days
saying, "I think I can pass it,

267
00:10:38,817 --> 00:10:42,552
I think I can pass it,
I think I can pass it."

268
00:10:44,022 --> 00:10:46,789
What is it about trains
that you like so much?

269
00:10:46,791 --> 00:10:48,958
What an interesting
question.

270
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:51,928
When I was a child,
life was confusing

271
00:10:51,930 --> 00:10:54,931
and chaotic for me, and
trains represented order.

272
00:10:54,933 --> 00:10:58,968
I could line them up,
categorize them, control them.

273
00:10:58,970 --> 00:11:00,470
I guess you
could say that

274
00:11:00,472 --> 00:11:03,906
they gave me a sense of calm
in a world that didn't.

275
00:11:03,908 --> 00:11:05,975
That's lovely, Sheldon.

276
00:11:05,977 --> 00:11:08,678
Well... other than when they're
chugging through your bowels,

277
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:10,513
these things are magic.

278
00:11:13,518 --> 00:11:15,485
I have to admit,
I've been worried about

279
00:11:15,487 --> 00:11:18,488
the military applications since
we started talking about this.

280
00:11:18,490 --> 00:11:19,856
Me, too.

281
00:11:19,858 --> 00:11:21,190
Why didn't you
say something?

282
00:11:21,192 --> 00:11:23,626
Same reason I don't
talk about ass cancer.

283
00:11:23,628 --> 00:11:26,596
It's not a
pleasant topic.

284
00:11:26,598 --> 00:11:28,164
You can't let this stop you.

285
00:11:28,166 --> 00:11:30,199
Almost any scientific
advancement can be used

286
00:11:30,201 --> 00:11:31,901
for destructive purposes.

287
00:11:31,903 --> 00:11:33,936
It's true. Even Einstein's
theory of relativity

288
00:11:33,938 --> 00:11:36,606
was later applied to the
development of nuclear weapons.

289
00:11:36,608 --> 00:11:38,441
E equals MC squared.

290
00:11:38,443 --> 00:11:39,809
Yeah.

291
00:11:39,811 --> 00:11:41,144
"E" is for energy,
"M" for mass,

292
00:11:41,146 --> 00:11:42,578
and "C" for the speed of light.

293
00:11:44,749 --> 00:11:46,315
How do you know that?

294
00:11:46,317 --> 00:11:49,919
Oh, Leonard mumbles it when
he wants sex to last longer.

295
00:11:53,024 --> 00:11:53,990
Hey, Raj.

296
00:11:53,992 --> 00:11:56,058
Hey, Claire.
Good, you're here.

297
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:57,927
Guys, this is
my friend Claire.

298
00:11:57,929 --> 00:12:00,129
We're casually dating,
and there's no need

299
00:12:00,131 --> 00:12:02,565
for any further questions
about it.

300
00:12:03,334 --> 00:12:05,635
Would you like
a glass of wine?

301
00:12:05,637 --> 00:12:07,403
I said no questions!

302
00:12:09,507 --> 00:12:11,741
And last
but not least,

303
00:12:11,743 --> 00:12:15,745
this is one that I like to call
Star Wars Toast because...

304
00:12:15,747 --> 00:12:20,082
it has a light side
and a dark side.

305
00:12:22,787 --> 00:12:25,087
All righty, it's time for
Dungeons & Dragons!

306
00:12:25,089 --> 00:12:27,457
Dungeons & Dragons.

307
00:12:27,459 --> 00:12:28,791
That sounds about right.

308
00:12:28,793 --> 00:12:31,327
You're gonna
enjoy this.

309
00:12:31,329 --> 00:12:34,063
I designed it
especially for you.

310
00:12:34,065 --> 00:12:35,698
Okay, but just for a little bit.

311
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:37,400
Oh, I have a feeling
that once you start,

312
00:12:37,402 --> 00:12:40,203
you're not gonna want to
or be allowed to stop.

313
00:12:40,205 --> 00:12:43,039
All right.

314
00:12:43,041 --> 00:12:44,040
Ready?

315
00:12:44,042 --> 00:12:45,808
You bet.

316
00:12:45,810 --> 00:12:47,443
Your name is

317
00:12:47,445 --> 00:12:48,544
Bernatrix.

318
00:12:48,546 --> 00:12:49,846
You are a warrior queen.

319
00:12:49,848 --> 00:12:52,715
You're strong,
beautiful and tall.

320
00:12:52,717 --> 00:12:56,519
Oh. I like the idea
of being tall.

321
00:12:56,521 --> 00:12:58,955
I think you're gonna like
a lot of things I have in store.

322
00:12:58,957 --> 00:13:01,557
For example, in this world,
only the men get pregnant,

323
00:13:01,559 --> 00:13:06,295
so your husband is home trying
not to pee when he laughs.

324
00:13:06,297 --> 00:13:08,264
This is getting fun.
What's next?

325
00:13:08,266 --> 00:13:10,433
You're parched and weary
from battle.

326
00:13:10,435 --> 00:13:13,703
You stand in front of a tavern
that serves the coldest,

327
00:13:13,705 --> 00:13:16,005
most delicious ale
in all the realm.

328
00:13:16,007 --> 00:13:18,374
Oh, I haven't had
a drink in months.

329
00:13:18,376 --> 00:13:20,109
What do you do?

330
00:13:20,111 --> 00:13:23,112
I storm in, slam my sword down,

331
00:13:23,114 --> 00:13:25,648
and say, "Barkeep, bring me
the strongest ale you have

332
00:13:25,650 --> 00:13:27,984
and serve it in
the skull of a goblin!"

333
00:13:30,922 --> 00:13:33,489
He wants to see I.D.

334
00:13:36,194 --> 00:13:39,362
So, Claire, we've heard so many
wonderful things about you.

335
00:13:39,364 --> 00:13:41,864
Really? Like what?

336
00:13:43,902 --> 00:13:46,168
Uh, mostly Penny's
heard them.

337
00:13:48,006 --> 00:13:50,740
Boy, you get some
dirty looks over there

338
00:13:50,742 --> 00:13:52,775
when you ask for ice.

339
00:13:53,545 --> 00:13:56,145
Zack, this is
my friend Claire.

340
00:13:56,147 --> 00:13:58,648
You're hot. You seeing anybody?

341
00:13:58,650 --> 00:14:00,750
Uh, she's seeing me.

342
00:14:00,752 --> 00:14:01,984
Why'd you say she's your friend?

343
00:14:01,986 --> 00:14:03,219
We're just
keeping it casual.

344
00:14:03,221 --> 00:14:05,454
Why is he being casual with you?
You seem great.

345
00:14:05,456 --> 00:14:06,856
I don't know. Ask him.

346
00:14:06,858 --> 00:14:09,225
Why are you being casual
with her? She seems great.

347
00:14:17,168 --> 00:14:19,535
Maybe we should
take a step back.

348
00:14:19,537 --> 00:14:21,070
Take a step back?

349
00:14:21,072 --> 00:14:23,172
I'm not a young man anymore.

350
00:14:24,576 --> 00:14:28,077
No, I mean reevaluate what we're
doing with the guidance system.

351
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:30,646
But I got a baby
on the way.

352
00:14:30,648 --> 00:14:32,214
I got to make some money.

353
00:14:32,216 --> 00:14:33,749
What good is
money gonna do

354
00:14:33,751 --> 00:14:35,451
if we inadvertently
bring about Armageddon?

355
00:14:35,453 --> 00:14:37,219
Okay, let me stop you
right there.

356
00:14:37,221 --> 00:14:38,454
We absolutely know

357
00:14:38,456 --> 00:14:41,557
our invention will not be used
to destroy the world.

358
00:14:41,559 --> 00:14:42,625
How?

359
00:14:42,627 --> 00:14:43,993
Because no one from the future

360
00:14:43,995 --> 00:14:46,128
has come back to kill us.

361
00:14:47,966 --> 00:14:49,332
Very funny.

362
00:14:49,334 --> 00:14:50,766
You got something better?

363
00:14:50,768 --> 00:14:52,101
Well, not really.

364
00:14:52,103 --> 00:14:53,703
Okay, then.

365
00:14:59,010 --> 00:15:00,876
Geez, how much wine
did you drink?

366
00:15:00,878 --> 00:15:04,614
Not a lot. I just couldn't
start until you walked away.

367
00:15:07,986 --> 00:15:10,686
The Hell Prawn lunges
out of the hot spring!

368
00:15:11,689 --> 00:15:13,990
You block it with your shield.

369
00:15:13,992 --> 00:15:14,991
Do you attack?

370
00:15:14,993 --> 00:15:16,125
Does it have eyes?

371
00:15:16,127 --> 00:15:18,661
Three giant red ones
and they never blink.

372
00:15:18,663 --> 00:15:20,296
It's unsettling.

373
00:15:20,298 --> 00:15:22,832
I stab it in the middle eye!

374
00:15:24,135 --> 00:15:25,134
Good choice!

375
00:15:25,136 --> 00:15:26,736
Critical hit!
Your sword goes

376
00:15:26,738 --> 00:15:28,904
through its eye
into its tiny brain.

377
00:15:28,906 --> 00:15:31,207
With its final dying gasp,
it says,

378
00:15:31,209 --> 00:15:32,742
"You have reduced me

379
00:15:32,744 --> 00:15:34,677
"to a pile of sushi.

380
00:15:34,679 --> 00:15:36,345
"Enjoy me

381
00:15:36,347 --> 00:15:39,281
"with this packet of soy sauce.

382
00:15:39,283 --> 00:15:41,951
It's low sodium."

383
00:15:43,655 --> 00:15:45,721
Okay, I guess I should
eat the Hell Prawn.

384
00:15:45,723 --> 00:15:46,689
Using your sword,

385
00:15:46,691 --> 00:15:48,991
you prepare a beautiful
sushi dinner.

386
00:15:48,993 --> 00:15:52,161
You slip into the hot spring
and enjoy the warm water

387
00:15:52,163 --> 00:15:53,295
on your aching joints.

388
00:15:53,297 --> 00:15:54,563
As you happily
close your eyes,

389
00:15:54,565 --> 00:15:56,866
you recall the incredible
evening you've had

390
00:15:56,868 --> 00:15:58,300
and notice that your...

391
00:15:59,704 --> 00:16:04,073
feet and ankles are
smaller than they've ever been.

392
00:16:04,075 --> 00:16:05,741
The end.

393
00:16:05,743 --> 00:16:09,512
Wow, this night turned out to be
so much more fun than I thought.

394
00:16:09,514 --> 00:16:10,846
Oh, the fun doesn't stop.

395
00:16:10,848 --> 00:16:13,315
You're still going home
with a goodie bag full of toast.

396
00:16:16,587 --> 00:16:18,287
Thank you for this.

397
00:16:18,289 --> 00:16:20,990
You know, ever since people
found out I'm having a baby,

398
00:16:20,992 --> 00:16:23,793
I feel like I became
Pregnant Bernadette.

399
00:16:23,795 --> 00:16:25,928
It was nice to take
a little break tonight.

400
00:16:25,930 --> 00:16:28,064
I can understand that.

401
00:16:28,066 --> 00:16:30,433
From the moment
people realized I was a genius,

402
00:16:30,435 --> 00:16:32,234
I've been Sheldon the Genius.

403
00:16:34,138 --> 00:16:35,971
Although I've never really
wanted a break from that,

404
00:16:35,973 --> 00:16:37,606
so I suppose I don't understand.

405
00:16:37,608 --> 00:16:39,341
Which is ironic

406
00:16:39,343 --> 00:16:41,343
'cause, you know, genius.

407
00:16:43,548 --> 00:16:45,347
Well, thanks again.

408
00:16:45,349 --> 00:16:46,449
You're welcome.

409
00:16:46,451 --> 00:16:47,883
And any time you need a break

410
00:16:47,885 --> 00:16:49,285
from being
Bernadette the Pregnant,

411
00:16:49,287 --> 00:16:51,487
Bernatrix the Warrior Queen
is here waiting.

412
00:16:51,489 --> 00:16:53,456
I might just take
you up on that.

413
00:16:53,458 --> 00:16:54,790
Well, mind you now,

414
00:16:54,792 --> 00:16:57,226
that offer's only good
until the third trimester.

415
00:16:57,228 --> 00:17:00,963
I can't risk getting
amniotic fluid on my spot.

416
00:17:03,067 --> 00:17:06,502
Hey, dude, you're
killing me with Claire.

417
00:17:06,504 --> 00:17:07,570
What are you talking about?

418
00:17:07,572 --> 00:17:10,139
I mean,
come on, look at you.

419
00:17:10,141 --> 00:17:13,175
You're classically handsome,
you've got a swimmer's body.

420
00:17:13,177 --> 00:17:16,378
Next to you,
I look like me.

421
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:19,448
Oh, man,
I didn't mean to do that.

422
00:17:19,450 --> 00:17:22,485
But I do appreciate you
recognizing my swimmer's body.

423
00:17:22,487 --> 00:17:24,720
Which, incidentally,

424
00:17:24,722 --> 00:17:27,790
I got from playing
Marco Polo at the YMCA.

425
00:17:29,827 --> 00:17:32,561
Yeah, okay, just...
do me a favor

426
00:17:32,563 --> 00:17:35,364
and stop talking about
how great Claire is.

427
00:17:35,366 --> 00:17:38,534
Anything for you,
my little foreign friend.

428
00:17:39,771 --> 00:17:41,170
So, I got to ask,

429
00:17:41,172 --> 00:17:43,239
does Raj bring around
other girls?

430
00:17:44,108 --> 00:17:45,608
Uh, you know,

431
00:17:45,610 --> 00:17:47,810
I-I'm not really
around that much.

432
00:17:47,812 --> 00:17:49,845
Amy knows much more
than I do.

433
00:17:51,249 --> 00:17:52,982
I don't think you have
anything to worry about.

434
00:17:52,984 --> 00:17:55,651
Raj is a terrific guy,
loyal to a fault.

435
00:17:55,653 --> 00:17:58,821
Yeah. He still has
an AOL address.

436
00:18:00,191 --> 00:18:01,724
I see what you're saying.

437
00:18:01,726 --> 00:18:04,727
She's not so great.

438
00:18:08,566 --> 00:18:10,466
Don't listen to him.

439
00:18:10,468 --> 00:18:12,334
He says crazy things
all the time.

440
00:18:12,336 --> 00:18:13,335
Uh, watch. Marco.

441
00:18:13,337 --> 00:18:15,070
Polo!

442
00:18:16,974 --> 00:18:20,109
So, uh, what are
you guys talking about?

443
00:18:20,111 --> 00:18:22,077
Your friends were
just telling me about

444
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:23,679
all the other girls
you're dating.

445
00:18:23,681 --> 00:18:26,115
Why would you do that?

446
00:18:26,117 --> 00:18:28,784
I specifically asked you
not to do that.

447
00:18:28,786 --> 00:18:30,052
We didn't.

448
00:18:30,054 --> 00:18:31,320
You just did.

449
00:18:33,858 --> 00:18:37,359
Wow. Maybe none of
you guys are smart.

450
00:18:47,569 --> 00:18:49,635
Morning.

451
00:18:49,637 --> 00:18:50,836
Morning.

452
00:18:50,838 --> 00:18:52,870
Ugh. Too much wine.

453
00:18:52,871 --> 00:18:54,137
Oh, I overdid it

454
00:18:54,139 --> 00:18:55,438
myself last night.

455
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:57,073
Hair of the dog.

456
00:18:58,677 --> 00:19:01,811
Hey, did you ever think about
the military applications

457
00:19:01,813 --> 00:19:03,380
for the guidance system?

458
00:19:03,382 --> 00:19:05,148
Of course.

459
00:19:05,150 --> 00:19:06,483
Does it bother you?

460
00:19:07,319 --> 00:19:09,119
No, it did at first,

461
00:19:09,121 --> 00:19:12,689
but then I talked it through
with Frank and Alicia, and...

462
00:19:15,494 --> 00:19:18,662
they really helped
put things into perspective.

463
00:19:18,664 --> 00:19:21,498
Who are these people?

464
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:26,436
Leonard, friends are
like toilet paper.

465
00:19:26,438 --> 00:19:29,406
It's good to have extras
under the sink.

466
