1
00:00:01,340 --> 00:00:03,349
Here's a fun Postal fact.

2
00:00:03,373 --> 00:00:05,583
Yeah, the inner side
of our mailbox

3
00:00:05,607 --> 00:00:07,355
is under federal jurisdiction.

4
00:00:07,379 --> 00:00:09,425
So, if you broke
my right thumb,

5
00:00:09,449 --> 00:00:11,206
hat's Pasadena city police.

6
00:00:11,230 --> 00:00:13,091
But if you broke
my left thumb,

7
00:00:13,115 --> 00:00:14,673
hat's the FBI.

8
00:00:16,242 --> 00:00:18,703
If I'm going to jail, I'm killing him,
not breaking his thumb.

9
00:00:18,727 --> 00:00:20,011
No.

10
00:00:20,302 --> 00:00:22,778
Oh, I got a letter
from my Meemaw.

11
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:24,479
Umm. Smell this.

12
00:00:25,551 --> 00:00:26,269
What is that?

13
00:00:26,361 --> 00:00:28,999
Uh, roses, bengay,
and Dr. Schools' foot powder.

14
00:00:29,947 --> 00:00:32,219
Yeah, "Grandma",
by Calvin Klein.

15
00:00:34,335 --> 00:00:36,266
Yeah, the last time I got
a hand written letter,

16
00:00:36,290 --> 00:00:39,463
it was from someone who told me
I parked like a blind person.

17
00:00:39,487 --> 00:00:41,034
That someone has a name.

18
00:00:41,058 --> 00:00:42,731
Uh, thank you.

19
00:00:44,591 --> 00:00:46,641
Oh, Meemaw got
a new set of teeth.

20
00:00:47,891 --> 00:00:49,635
Oh, but then
she found her old ones.

21
00:00:50,905 --> 00:00:53,251
Oh, so now the new ones are
just gonna be her church teeth.

22
00:00:55,297 --> 00:00:57,223

42
00:01:53,227 --> 00:01:55,494
That's not her.
That's not her.

That's not her.
That's not her.

That's not her.

46
00:02:02,102 --> 00:02:03,969
That's not her.
Really?

47
00:02:03,971 --> 00:02:06,171
The old Asian man
is not your Meemaw?

48
00:02:07,942 --> 00:02:09,842
And that's not helpful.

49
00:02:10,811 --> 00:02:12,744
You know, I-I got her
an iPhone for Christmas.

50
00:02:12,746 --> 00:02:14,213
I'll see where she is.

51
00:02:14,215 --> 00:02:15,414
Oh, that's nice.

52
00:02:15,416 --> 00:02:17,416
Most people her age
don't embrace technology.

53
00:02:17,418 --> 00:02:19,151
Oh, no, she doesn't
even know she has it.

54
00:02:19,153 --> 00:02:21,253
No, I had my sister
slip it in her bag

55
00:02:21,255 --> 00:02:25,023
so that I can track her
like a sea turtle.

56
00:02:25,025 --> 00:02:27,459
Same as when we lost you
at the zoo.

57
00:02:27,461 --> 00:02:29,328
Uh, for the hundredth time,

58
00:02:29,330 --> 00:02:31,697
I smelled kettle corn
and couldn't find the cart.

59
00:02:32,867 --> 00:02:34,099
Still doesn't explain

60
00:02:34,101 --> 00:02:37,336
how you ended up
on the freeway divider.

61
00:02:37,338 --> 00:02:39,438
Moon Pie!

62
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:40,639
Meemaw!

63
00:02:40,641 --> 00:02:42,674
I'm so happy to see you!

64
00:02:42,676 --> 00:02:43,976
I'm happy to
see you, too!

65
00:02:43,978 --> 00:02:45,210
Oh.

66
00:02:45,212 --> 00:02:46,478
You got even smaller.

67
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:48,013
I love it!

68
00:02:48,015 --> 00:02:50,015
Uh, Meemaw, this is Leonard.

69
00:02:50,017 --> 00:02:51,016
Leonard, this is my Meemaw.

70
00:02:51,018 --> 00:02:52,284
Hi. So nice
o finally meet you.

71
00:02:52,286 --> 00:02:53,852
Let me take this
for you, Meemaw.

72
00:02:53,854 --> 00:02:55,020
Thank you.

73
00:02:55,022 --> 00:02:57,022
No. Oh, no.
Now you call her "Constance."

74
00:02:57,024 --> 00:02:58,490
I call her "Meemaw."

75
00:02:58,492 --> 00:02:59,758
You have your own Meemaw.

76
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,727
It's not my fault
she died when you were four.

77
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:05,797
Is that nice to say
o your friend?

78
00:03:05,799 --> 00:03:07,699
It isn't, Meemaw.

79
00:03:07,701 --> 00:03:09,868
Sorry, Leonard.

80
00:03:11,105 --> 00:03:13,538
Can you please
live with us forever?

81
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:15,908
Oh.

82
00:03:17,077 --> 00:03:18,677
That's ridiculous!
If you had

83
00:03:18,679 --> 00:03:21,146
a superpower,
and spent your whole life

84
00:03:21,148 --> 00:03:22,848
being told to suppress it,

85
00:03:22,850 --> 00:03:25,284
when you finally decide
o embrace that power,

86
00:03:25,286 --> 00:03:27,519
why hide in isolation?

87
00:03:27,521 --> 00:03:28,954
I'm sorry,

88
00:03:28,956 --> 00:03:32,591
and how much money did
your version of Frozen make?

89
00:03:33,727 --> 00:03:35,294
I'm just saying,

90
00:03:35,296 --> 00:03:36,962
instead of "Let it Go,"
she should really sing,

91
00:03:36,964 --> 00:03:39,264
"Look At Me Hiding in a Freezer
Like a Dove Bar."

92
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:42,834
She built an ice castle,
made a snow monster

93
00:03:42,836 --> 00:03:45,837
and gave herself
a complete makeover in one day.

94
00:03:45,839 --> 00:03:47,539
You know what I saw
you do today?

95
00:03:47,541 --> 00:03:50,008
Eat a block of cream cheese
straight from the foil

96
00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:52,511
and lie about it to your wife!

97
00:03:54,214 --> 00:03:55,948
Sorry for eavesdropping,
but did you know

98
00:03:55,950 --> 00:03:58,583
hey actually had
he song "Let It Go" in place

99
00:03:58,585 --> 00:04:00,218
before they finalized the story?

100
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:02,654
Yeah, that's true. In fact,
hey liked the song so much,

101
00:04:02,656 --> 00:04:04,256
hey retooled
he whole script around it.

102
00:04:04,258 --> 00:04:06,191
Which is probably
why that movie sucks.

103
00:04:06,193 --> 00:04:08,427
Here we are
alking about Frozen,

104
00:04:08,429 --> 00:04:09,828
and yet, you got burned.

105
00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:11,964
Miss, I'm so sorry.

106
00:04:11,966 --> 00:04:13,432
How can you not like that movie?

107
00:04:13,434 --> 00:04:15,434
I just think it gets more credit
han it deserves.

108
00:04:15,436 --> 00:04:16,935
Oh, that's what I said
an hour ago.

109
00:04:16,937 --> 00:04:20,706
Wow. You've been talking
about Frozen for an hour?

110
00:04:21,742 --> 00:04:25,110
You should've seen us
after The Good Dinosaur.

111
00:04:25,112 --> 00:04:28,947
It was a classic western
set in the post-Jurassic period,

112
00:04:28,949 --> 00:04:31,616
and it changed my life.

113
00:04:35,422 --> 00:04:36,922
Are you comfortable?

114
00:04:36,924 --> 00:04:38,623
Very.

115
00:04:38,625 --> 00:04:39,558
It's nice to rest

116
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:42,127
after 800 flights of stairs.

117
00:04:44,498 --> 00:04:47,499
You were so cute,
huffin' and puffin'.

118
00:04:48,736 --> 00:04:50,268
There's Amy.

119
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:51,937
I just know
you're gonna hit it off.

120
00:04:51,939 --> 00:04:54,673
You both have
he same fashion sense.

121
00:04:55,642 --> 00:04:59,344
Hello! Come in,
say hi to my Meemaw.

122
00:04:59,346 --> 00:05:00,812
Hi. Nice to meet you.

123
00:05:00,814 --> 00:05:02,347
Nice to meet you, too.

124
00:05:02,349 --> 00:05:03,348
How was your trip?

125
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:04,416
Wonderful.

126
00:05:04,418 --> 00:05:06,151
And the pilot did
such a good job,

127
00:05:06,153 --> 00:05:07,853
I gave him a butterscotch.

128
00:05:07,855 --> 00:05:09,821
That's great.

129
00:05:09,823 --> 00:05:12,257
And look at you,
sitting in Sheldon's spot.

130
00:05:12,259 --> 00:05:13,859
You know, I don't
even get to sit there.

131
00:05:13,861 --> 00:05:15,093
Yeah.

132
00:05:15,095 --> 00:05:16,795
And you never will.

133
00:05:16,797 --> 00:05:19,631
Ooh, hey, oh, ask her to do the
issue thing.

134
00:05:19,633 --> 00:05:20,799
Do it, ask her.

135
00:05:22,002 --> 00:05:23,135
Can I have a tissue?

136
00:05:23,137 --> 00:05:24,536
Of course.

137
00:05:27,341 --> 00:05:28,540
Isn't that the best?

138
00:05:28,542 --> 00:05:30,709
She's like Grandma Spider-Man.

139
00:05:31,712 --> 00:05:33,412
He's been saying that

140
00:05:33,414 --> 00:05:34,713
since he was little.

141
00:05:34,715 --> 00:05:37,215
I still don't know
what it means.

142
00:05:37,217 --> 00:05:39,418
Oh, well, you two sit down
and get to know each other.

143
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:40,685
I'll get your room ready.

144
00:05:40,687 --> 00:05:42,154
Oh, now don't you go
looking through

145
00:05:42,156 --> 00:05:43,989
my suitcase for presents.

146
00:05:43,991 --> 00:05:45,457
If I did, would I find any?

147
00:05:45,459 --> 00:05:46,691
Maybe.

148
00:05:46,693 --> 00:05:50,529
But you also might find
my brassieres and bloomers.

149
00:05:51,565 --> 00:05:54,433
That's a risk
I'm willing to take!

150
00:05:54,435 --> 00:05:55,967
Well, this is so nice.

151
00:05:55,969 --> 00:05:57,903
He's so excited
o have you here and...

152
00:05:57,905 --> 00:06:00,906
Okay, now let's you and me
get something straight.

153
00:06:00,908 --> 00:06:04,709
He may think that I came
o bake him cookies,

154
00:06:04,711 --> 00:06:07,579
but the real reason
is to size you up.

155
00:06:07,581 --> 00:06:09,781
S-S...

156
00:06:09,783 --> 00:06:11,583
Si-Size me up?

157
00:06:11,585 --> 00:06:14,286
Sheldon's mother may be
okay with you,

158
00:06:14,288 --> 00:06:16,054
but I'm not so easy.

159
00:06:16,056 --> 00:06:17,789
Well, I-I'm...

160
00:06:17,791 --> 00:06:20,992
I'm sure you'll like me
once you get to know me.

161
00:06:20,994 --> 00:06:23,195
Oh, you better hope so.

162
00:06:24,598 --> 00:06:27,199
A Texas Special cattle
and calf car train set

163
00:06:27,201 --> 00:06:28,767
with authentic horn and bell!

164
00:06:28,769 --> 00:06:30,068
Thank you, Meemaw!

165
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:31,570
Oh, you're welcome, Moon Pie.

166
00:06:31,572 --> 00:06:32,838
Amy, why don't you

167
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:33,939
look excited?

168
00:06:33,941 --> 00:06:36,041
Well, you get
o watch me play with this!

169
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:42,180
Oh, I see you're reading Saga.

170
00:06:42,182 --> 00:06:44,249
Yeah, I hear it's pretty good.

171
00:06:44,251 --> 00:06:47,152
It is, and not a lot of comics
have a woman with wings

172
00:06:47,154 --> 00:06:49,688
breastfeeding a baby
right on the cover.

173
00:06:49,690 --> 00:06:52,157
I'll take your word for it.

174
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:53,158
You should.

175
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:55,527
He's really looked.

176
00:06:56,497 --> 00:06:58,997
I'm Raj, by the way.

177
00:06:58,999 --> 00:07:00,599
This is Howard.
Hi.

178
00:07:00,601 --> 00:07:02,033
Claire.

179
00:07:02,035 --> 00:07:03,969
Well, I've seen you here before,
Claire.

180
00:07:03,971 --> 00:07:05,470
It's my first time.

181
00:07:05,472 --> 00:07:08,106
I'm looking for inspiration
for this movie I'm writing.

182
00:07:08,108 --> 00:07:09,374
You're a screenwriter?

183
00:07:09,376 --> 00:07:12,611
Well, screenwriter,
slash bartender,

184
00:07:12,613 --> 00:07:16,314
slash, a month away
from living in my car.

185
00:07:16,316 --> 00:07:18,850
Yeah, I get that.

186
00:07:18,852 --> 00:07:20,285
I'm a scientist,

187
00:07:20,287 --> 00:07:21,686
slash party planner,

188
00:07:21,688 --> 00:07:23,688
slash small-dog enthusiast,

189
00:07:23,690 --> 00:07:25,490
slash...

190
00:07:25,492 --> 00:07:28,660
guy who probably should have
stopped at "scientist."

191
00:07:28,662 --> 00:07:30,562
You're really a scientist?

192
00:07:30,564 --> 00:07:31,663
Well, astrophysicist.

193
00:07:31,665 --> 00:07:33,031
That's perfect.

194
00:07:33,033 --> 00:07:35,700
Do you think I could pick your
brain for my movie some time?

195
00:07:35,702 --> 00:07:37,469
It's animated sci-fi for kids.

196
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:39,471
Sure. I love animated movies.
He does,

197
00:07:39,473 --> 00:07:42,274
and he has the Lilo & Stitch
collector plates to prove it.

198
00:07:44,077 --> 00:07:46,945
Excuse me for wanting
a little magic in my life.

199
00:07:48,282 --> 00:07:49,581
Here's my number.

200
00:07:49,583 --> 00:07:50,882
Give me a call,
we'll get together.

201
00:07:50,884 --> 00:07:52,751
Yeah, great.
See ya.

202
00:07:52,753 --> 00:07:54,653
Yeah, bye.

203
00:07:54,655 --> 00:07:55,954
What are you doing?

204
00:07:55,956 --> 00:07:57,289
You have a girlfriend.

205
00:07:57,291 --> 00:07:58,957
So?
So,

206
00:07:58,959 --> 00:08:00,325
how do you think she'd feel

207
00:08:00,327 --> 00:08:03,261
about you helping a beautiful
girl with her screenplay?

208
00:08:03,263 --> 00:08:04,763
I wouldn't say
she's beautiful.

209
00:08:04,765 --> 00:08:07,098
Really? You don't think
she's attractive?

210
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:09,935
I do. I just wouldn't
ell my girlfriend.

211
00:08:12,706 --> 00:08:15,340
Constance, are you sure
I can't pour you some wine?

212
00:08:15,342 --> 00:08:17,309
Oh, no wine for me.

213
00:08:17,311 --> 00:08:20,979
Sheldon's bringing me
my whiskey.

214
00:08:20,981 --> 00:08:23,181
Here you go, Meemaw.
I made it

215
00:08:23,183 --> 00:08:24,282
just how you like...

216
00:08:24,284 --> 00:08:26,351
a lot in a glass.

217
00:08:26,353 --> 00:08:29,120
Thank you, Moon Pie.

218
00:08:29,122 --> 00:08:30,322
Um, curious.

219
00:08:30,324 --> 00:08:32,691
Why do you call Sheldon
"Moon Pie?"

220
00:08:32,693 --> 00:08:34,793
'Cause he's so nummy-nummy.

221
00:08:34,795 --> 00:08:36,695
She could just eat him up.

222
00:08:37,464 --> 00:08:39,864
And I call her "Meemaw"

223
00:08:39,866 --> 00:08:41,866
because, well, just,
well, look at her.

224
00:08:43,203 --> 00:08:45,136
It's interesting that

225
00:08:45,138 --> 00:08:47,973
Leonard and Penny know
about his nickname

226
00:08:47,975 --> 00:08:49,207
and you don't.

227
00:08:49,209 --> 00:08:51,409
Oh, well, you know,

228
00:08:51,411 --> 00:08:53,845
now-now that I'm hearing it,
it does sound familiar.

229
00:08:53,847 --> 00:08:55,046
How could it?

230
00:08:55,048 --> 00:08:57,382
I never told you,
and you never bothered to ask.

231
00:08:57,384 --> 00:08:59,417
Well, now I know.
Yeah.

232
00:09:01,622 --> 00:09:04,055
So, Penny, I understand
you have a new job.

233
00:09:04,057 --> 00:09:05,123
Yes.

234
00:09:05,125 --> 00:09:06,391
I'm a pharmaceutical
sales rep.

235
00:09:06,393 --> 00:09:07,726
Oh.

236
00:09:07,728 --> 00:09:11,263
It's so wonderful that
you modern gals can have it all.

237
00:09:12,165 --> 00:09:14,532
A husband
and a full-time career.

238
00:09:14,534 --> 00:09:17,702
I have a relationship
and a full-time career, too.

239
00:09:17,704 --> 00:09:20,405
That doesn't bode well.

240
00:09:23,043 --> 00:09:26,144
Why not? You-you just said
it's okay for her to work.

241
00:09:26,146 --> 00:09:29,948
Well, Leonard doesn't need as
much tending to as Sheldon does.

242
00:09:29,950 --> 00:09:31,049
And as Moon Pie explained,

243
00:09:31,051 --> 00:09:33,652
Leonard's work

244
00:09:33,654 --> 00:09:36,021
is more of a hobby.

245
00:09:37,491 --> 00:09:39,391
That's my best friend.

246
00:09:39,393 --> 00:09:40,625
Yeah.

247
00:09:40,627 --> 00:09:42,027
Look,

248
00:09:42,029 --> 00:09:43,962
I-I get that you're protective
of your grandson,

249
00:09:43,964 --> 00:09:45,997
but he's an adult now.

250
00:09:45,999 --> 00:09:49,634
Maybe I understand what he needs
better than you do.

251
00:09:49,636 --> 00:09:52,137
I appreciate your honesty, dear.

252
00:09:52,139 --> 00:09:54,039
Thank you.
And here's

253
00:09:54,041 --> 00:09:55,373
some more honesty:

254
00:09:55,375 --> 00:09:58,109
I don't like you very much.

255
00:09:59,846 --> 00:10:01,446
Well, maybe I don't
like you either.

256
00:10:01,448 --> 00:10:02,714
No, no, no, no, no,

257
00:10:02,716 --> 00:10:04,983
no, no, no. Y-You have
o like each other.

258
00:10:04,985 --> 00:10:07,952
Well, we have a 4:30 reservation
at Applebee's.

259
00:10:10,157 --> 00:10:12,157
I think I should leave.

260
00:10:12,159 --> 00:10:13,625
But why?

261
00:10:13,627 --> 00:10:15,226
Other than
you two fighting,

262
00:10:15,228 --> 00:10:17,896
we're having such a good time.

263
00:10:17,898 --> 00:10:20,632
The minute you left the room,
your precious meemaw

264
00:10:20,634 --> 00:10:22,534
started giving me
a really hard time.

265
00:10:22,536 --> 00:10:23,902
I don't need this.

266
00:10:23,904 --> 00:10:24,903
Let her go.

267
00:10:24,905 --> 00:10:26,838
And under no circumstance

268
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:29,641
will you give her
hat engagement ring.

269
00:10:30,811 --> 00:10:31,776
What ring?

270
00:10:31,778 --> 00:10:34,479
Maybe we should give
hem some privacy.

271
00:10:34,481 --> 00:10:35,547
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

272
00:10:35,549 --> 00:10:37,515
You go ahead.
I'll catch up with you.

273
00:10:39,753 --> 00:10:41,953
You have
an engagement ring?

274
00:10:41,955 --> 00:10:43,988
Yes.

275
00:10:44,825 --> 00:10:47,292
Penny, did you know
about this?

276
00:10:47,294 --> 00:10:49,160
All right, let's go.

277
00:10:59,110 --> 00:11:01,644
When did you get
an engagement ring?

278
00:11:01,646 --> 00:11:02,812
My mother gave it to me,

279
00:11:02,814 --> 00:11:04,881
and I had been thinking
about giving it to you,

280
00:11:04,883 --> 00:11:06,349
but then we broke up.

281
00:11:06,351 --> 00:11:07,950
Well, thank goodness
for that.

282
00:11:07,952 --> 00:11:10,086
Sheldon, will you please tell
your grandmother

283
00:11:10,088 --> 00:11:11,487
o stay out of this?

284
00:11:11,489 --> 00:11:13,890
Oh, I don't think
I could do that.

285
00:11:13,892 --> 00:11:15,625
Sheldon, tell this girl

286
00:11:15,627 --> 00:11:18,561
hat my ring will never be
on her finger.

287
00:11:18,563 --> 00:11:19,929
Y...

288
00:11:19,931 --> 00:11:23,132
I'm gonna opt out
of that one, too.

289
00:11:23,134 --> 00:11:25,735
Who said I even want
o be engaged to him?

290
00:11:25,737 --> 00:11:27,603
And if I do, I-I don't need
your hand-me-downs!

291
00:11:27,605 --> 00:11:28,604
All right, all right!

292
00:11:28,606 --> 00:11:29,806
Look, l-let's all...

293
00:11:29,808 --> 00:11:31,174
let's remain calm

294
00:11:31,176 --> 00:11:32,475
and analyze this situation.

295
00:11:32,477 --> 00:11:34,677
Now, I realize that
you've only known each other

296
00:11:34,679 --> 00:11:35,845
for less than a day,

297
00:11:35,847 --> 00:11:38,648
but is it possible this
crankiness is because

298
00:11:38,650 --> 00:11:40,483
your cycles have synced?

299
00:11:40,485 --> 00:11:42,385
You leave the room

300
00:11:42,387 --> 00:11:44,253
and let the grown-ups talk.

301
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:45,421
Now.

302
00:11:45,423 --> 00:11:48,357
Don't speak to him
like he's a child.

303
00:11:48,359 --> 00:11:51,828
Thank you. I'm gonna go next
door and play with Leonard.

304
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:57,467
Okay, so you met this girl,
you exchanged numbers,

305
00:11:57,469 --> 00:11:58,901
and you're gonna
meet up with her.

306
00:11:58,903 --> 00:12:00,536
Just to help her
with her screenplay.

307
00:12:00,538 --> 00:12:02,438
Oh. Well,
I guess that's not so bad.

308
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:03,473
You weren't there.

309
00:12:03,475 --> 00:12:04,707
He was really flirting.

310
00:12:04,709 --> 00:12:07,643
Hey, it's not my fault
if American women project

311
00:12:07,645 --> 00:12:09,045
heir fantasies on foreigners

312
00:12:09,047 --> 00:12:12,849
with the kind of magical voice
hat grants wishes.

313
00:12:12,851 --> 00:12:14,984
I'm sure it was harmless.

314
00:12:14,986 --> 00:12:16,352
People flirt. No big deal.

315
00:12:16,354 --> 00:12:18,321
Really? So it's
okay if I fl...

316
00:12:18,323 --> 00:12:20,490
Not you. I own your ass.

317
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:24,694
The real question is,
where are you with Emily?

318
00:12:24,696 --> 00:12:26,562
Uh, it's hard to say.

319
00:12:26,564 --> 00:12:28,598
I think we're good,
but things like this

320
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:31,067
make me wonder if Emily's
really the right person for me.

321
00:12:31,069 --> 00:12:33,136
I mean, did you guys ever have
doubts about each other?

322
00:12:33,138 --> 00:12:35,471
No. Never.
Absolutely.

323
00:12:35,473 --> 00:12:36,606
What?

324
00:12:36,608 --> 00:12:37,807
Howie, you forget

325
00:12:37,809 --> 00:12:39,142
how much of our early dates

326
00:12:39,144 --> 00:12:40,276
involved you doing magic

327
00:12:40,278 --> 00:12:41,978
and me doing this.

328
00:12:43,715 --> 00:12:45,281
Fine.

329
00:12:45,283 --> 00:12:47,416
I had reservations
about you, too.

330
00:12:47,418 --> 00:12:48,217
No, you didn't.

331
00:12:48,219 --> 00:12:49,819
No, I didn't.

332
00:12:49,821 --> 00:12:51,721
Well, it doesn't matter now,

333
00:12:51,723 --> 00:12:53,723
'cause I love
how things worked out.

334
00:12:53,725 --> 00:12:54,857
Me, too.

335
00:12:54,859 --> 00:12:56,759
And I think you're
even more beautiful

336
00:12:56,761 --> 00:12:58,961
han this rose.

337
00:13:04,235 --> 00:13:07,203
Wow. The last time
I saw my grandma,

338
00:13:07,205 --> 00:13:08,638
he most exciting thing
was watching the ash

339
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:10,406
of her cigarette get longer
and wondering

340
00:13:10,408 --> 00:13:13,109
if it was gonna fall
in her pudding.

341
00:13:13,111 --> 00:13:14,844
Did it?

342
00:13:14,846 --> 00:13:15,845
Yeah, right in there.

343
00:13:15,847 --> 00:13:17,580
She ate it and everything.

344
00:13:17,582 --> 00:13:19,816
Leonard and Penny.

345
00:13:19,818 --> 00:13:21,551
Leonard and Penny.
Leonard and Penny.

346
00:13:21,553 --> 00:13:22,919
Come in!

347
00:13:22,921 --> 00:13:24,220
Hey. What happened?

348
00:13:24,222 --> 00:13:25,421
Is Amy gone?

349
00:13:25,423 --> 00:13:27,156
No. They asked me to leave

350
00:13:27,158 --> 00:13:28,891
so they could speak privately.

351
00:13:28,893 --> 00:13:30,793
Uh-oh.
Yeah, I know. It was quite tense.

352
00:13:30,795 --> 00:13:33,462
So here's
he million dollar question:

353
00:13:33,464 --> 00:13:37,200
uh, who wants to pop over there
and get my trains?

354
00:13:40,004 --> 00:13:42,004
All right.
I've made up my mind.

355
00:13:42,006 --> 00:13:43,840
I'm gonna do the right thing,
call this girl,

356
00:13:43,842 --> 00:13:45,675
and let her know
hat I'm in a relationship.

357
00:13:45,677 --> 00:13:46,809
Okay, so far we've heard,

358
00:13:46,811 --> 00:13:48,711
"made up my mind,
I'm dumping Emily."

359
00:13:48,713 --> 00:13:50,446
"Made up my mind
o date both of them

360
00:13:50,448 --> 00:13:53,382
by pretending
o be twin brothers."

361
00:13:54,252 --> 00:13:55,251
And "made up my mind,

362
00:13:55,253 --> 00:13:56,419
"I'll ask for a threesome

363
00:13:56,421 --> 00:13:59,121
and if they say no,
play it off as a joke."

364
00:13:59,123 --> 00:14:00,489
I'm calling her.

365
00:14:00,491 --> 00:14:03,726
And the threesome didn't deserve
he belly laugh it got.

366
00:14:03,728 --> 00:14:05,361
You're right.

367
00:14:05,363 --> 00:14:08,831
It could totally happen.

368
00:14:08,833 --> 00:14:09,899
Hello?

369
00:14:09,901 --> 00:14:11,467
Hi. Hi. Yeah, it's Raj.

370
00:14:11,469 --> 00:14:13,402
Rajesh.
We met at the comic book store.

371
00:14:13,404 --> 00:14:15,738
Hey, what's up? Figure out
what time you're free?

372
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:17,106
Actually,
hat's why I'm calling.

373
00:14:17,108 --> 00:14:18,474
I, um... I just...

374
00:14:18,476 --> 00:14:21,143
I need to let you know
hat I have a girlfriend.

375
00:14:21,145 --> 00:14:23,079
Okay. Good for you.

376
00:14:23,882 --> 00:14:24,914
Well, no, no.

377
00:14:24,916 --> 00:14:26,082
I-I didn't want to mislead you

378
00:14:26,084 --> 00:14:27,383
after you asked me out.

379
00:14:27,385 --> 00:14:29,018
I didn't ask you out.

380
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:30,887
I just need help
with my screenplay.

381
00:14:30,889 --> 00:14:33,422
Wait, are you saying
hat we didn't have a vibe?

382
00:14:33,424 --> 00:14:35,591
Why do you care if we have
a vibe? You have a girlfriend.

383
00:14:35,593 --> 00:14:37,593
Come on! I just told you
I had a girlfriend.

384
00:14:37,595 --> 00:14:39,515
The least you can do is tell me
if we had a vibe.

385
00:14:41,132 --> 00:14:42,498
Sure, we had a vibe.

386
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:44,300
I knew it.
Okay, we did have a vibe.

387
00:14:44,302 --> 00:14:45,601
This is exciting.

388
00:14:45,603 --> 00:14:47,770
What's my next move?

389
00:14:47,772 --> 00:14:49,138
You still have a girlfriend.

390
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:51,307
Right. Good catch.

391
00:14:52,277 --> 00:14:53,943
Anyway, so I'm sorry
o waste your time.

392
00:14:53,945 --> 00:14:55,578
And, uh... and good luck
with your screenplay.

393
00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:56,913
Hang on.

394
00:14:56,915 --> 00:14:58,314
We're both adults.

395
00:14:58,316 --> 00:15:00,516
We can still get together
without it meaning anything.

396
00:15:00,518 --> 00:15:02,885
Not me. Ever since
you admitted we had a vibe,

397
00:15:02,887 --> 00:15:04,820
I've been planning our wedding.

398
00:15:06,224 --> 00:15:08,925
Look, it's just coffee.

399
00:15:08,927 --> 00:15:10,526
I'll ask you some questions
about science,

400
00:15:10,528 --> 00:15:13,362
and if you propose,
I promise to say no.

401
00:15:13,364 --> 00:15:16,599
Okay. That hurts a little,
but okay.

402
00:15:17,302 --> 00:15:18,834
Great. I'll text you.

403
00:15:18,836 --> 00:15:20,436
Bye.

404
00:15:20,438 --> 00:15:21,737
All right.

405
00:15:21,739 --> 00:15:24,674
So, uh, we're meeting
for coffee like two adults.

406
00:15:24,676 --> 00:15:26,575
Everybody's happy. Easy peasy.

407
00:15:26,577 --> 00:15:28,210
Are you gonna tell Emily?

408
00:15:28,212 --> 00:15:29,345
Yeah, of course.

409
00:15:29,347 --> 00:15:30,813
We have no secrets.

410
00:15:31,616 --> 00:15:33,349
When are you gonna tell Emily?

411
00:15:34,218 --> 00:15:36,419
He lied about the cream cheese!

412
00:15:36,421 --> 00:15:38,487
He ate the whole thing!
I saw him!

413
00:15:41,326 --> 00:15:43,826
Look, I know you think
I'm not right for Sheldon,

414
00:15:43,828 --> 00:15:45,828
but trust me,
I'm his best shot.

415
00:15:45,830 --> 00:15:48,331
You have no idea
how much I put up with!

416
00:15:48,333 --> 00:15:50,599
I know more than you think I do.

417
00:15:50,601 --> 00:15:52,735
Really? You know what it's like
o have date night ruined

418
00:15:52,737 --> 00:15:55,471
because Google changed
heir font?

419
00:15:55,473 --> 00:15:57,473
Young lady,

420
00:15:57,475 --> 00:15:59,141
if you think I don't know

421
00:15:59,143 --> 00:16:00,376
what it's like to live

422
00:16:00,378 --> 00:16:02,478
with a stubborn,
egotistical man,

423
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:03,813
hen you're wrong.

424
00:16:03,815 --> 00:16:05,848
'Cause that was my husband.

425
00:16:05,850 --> 00:16:07,583
Really?

426
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:11,554
There were days I wanted to fill
his pockets with corn

427
00:16:11,556 --> 00:16:14,090
and toss him in the pigpen.

428
00:16:14,926 --> 00:16:17,159
Well, if you understand,

429
00:16:17,161 --> 00:16:19,829
hen why are you giving me
such a hard time?

430
00:16:19,831 --> 00:16:21,931
Because when you broke up
with Sheldon,

431
00:16:21,933 --> 00:16:23,232
it hurt him deeply,

432
00:16:23,234 --> 00:16:25,668
and I don't want to see
hat happen again.

433
00:16:26,871 --> 00:16:28,838
Hi. Sorry.

434
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:31,073
Sheldon would like
o say something to you.

435
00:16:31,075 --> 00:16:32,141
No, I wouldn't.

436
00:16:32,143 --> 00:16:33,442
Just get in here.

437
00:16:34,846 --> 00:16:35,878
Hello.

438
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:37,346
Go ahead.

439
00:16:37,348 --> 00:16:38,914
Meemaw, look,

440
00:16:38,916 --> 00:16:40,883
I'm sorry, but...

441
00:16:40,885 --> 00:16:42,184
I have to defend

442
00:16:42,186 --> 00:16:44,120
my girlfriend to you.

443
00:16:44,122 --> 00:16:46,422
Oh, Sheldon, thank you.

444
00:16:46,424 --> 00:16:49,025
Oh, great, now you're gonna
get emotional.

445
00:16:53,664 --> 00:16:57,266
I always looked up
o you and Pop-Pop.

446
00:16:57,268 --> 00:16:59,535
I-I know what
a challenging man he could be,

447
00:16:59,537 --> 00:17:02,872
but I saw you stand
by him and-and make him

448
00:17:02,874 --> 00:17:04,473
into a better person.

449
00:17:04,475 --> 00:17:05,508
I did.

450
00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:06,609
Yeah, well, that is exactly

451
00:17:06,611 --> 00:17:08,577
what I've been doing
he last five years

452
00:17:08,579 --> 00:17:10,813
with this little
work in progress.

453
00:17:13,584 --> 00:17:15,785
He never disappoints,
does he?

454
00:17:16,954 --> 00:17:19,989
I think what Sheldon means
o say is

455
00:17:19,991 --> 00:17:22,191
we've both grown together.

456
00:17:22,193 --> 00:17:23,259
Isn't that right?

457
00:17:23,261 --> 00:17:24,660
Well...

458
00:17:24,662 --> 00:17:25,127
Say yes.

459
00:17:25,129 --> 00:17:26,495
Yes.

460
00:17:26,497 --> 00:17:27,897
Fine.

461
00:17:27,899 --> 00:17:31,600
If you feel so strongly,
I won't stand in your way.

462
00:17:31,602 --> 00:17:32,835
Thank you.

463
00:17:32,837 --> 00:17:33,936
So if he wanted

464
00:17:33,938 --> 00:17:36,138
o give me
hat engagement ring,

465
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:38,174
we would have your blessing?

466
00:17:38,176 --> 00:17:40,176
I suppose.

467
00:17:45,483 --> 00:17:47,049
I just gave you
my virginity, woman.

468
00:17:47,051 --> 00:17:48,784
Cool your jets.

469
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:02,401
Yeah, see, if you
just change the story

470
00:18:02,403 --> 00:18:04,537
o the destruction
of our galaxy,

471
00:18:04,539 --> 00:18:07,039
hen a super massive
black hole could work.

472
00:18:07,041 --> 00:18:08,607
This is great.

473
00:18:08,609 --> 00:18:10,876
Thank you so much.

474
00:18:10,878 --> 00:18:12,778
I just got to figure out
a way for everyone

475
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:15,448
o die that isn't too scary
for children.

476
00:18:17,085 --> 00:18:20,886
And that's how
Mommy and Daddy met.

477
00:18:22,356 --> 00:18:24,657
Hey, did you ever tell Emily
about us?

478
00:18:24,659 --> 00:18:26,125
I will!
