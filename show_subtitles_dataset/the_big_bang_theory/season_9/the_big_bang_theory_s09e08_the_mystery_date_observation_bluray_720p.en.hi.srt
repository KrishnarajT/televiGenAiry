1
00:00:02,079 --> 00:00:05,848
"Kup-fun-tor
ha'kiv na'ish Du stau."

2
00:00:06,749 --> 00:00:09,317
Do you know what that means?
No.

3
00:00:09,319 --> 00:00:10,553
Are you telling the truth?

4
00:00:10,554 --> 00:00:12,321
Nersh.

5
00:00:13,957 --> 00:00:16,391
This is ridiculous— being upset
about Amy all the time

6
00:00:16,394 --> 00:00:17,592
isn't accomplishing anything.

7
00:00:17,594 --> 00:00:19,495
If I want to resolve
this situation,

8
00:00:19,496 --> 00:00:21,097
then I need to take action.

9
00:00:21,098 --> 00:00:23,332
What are you gonna do?
I'm going to find her

10
00:00:23,333 --> 00:00:24,434
and ask her to marry me.

11
00:00:24,435 --> 00:00:26,101
And if she says yes,

12
00:00:26,103 --> 00:00:28,770
we can put this behind us
and resume our relationship.

13
00:00:28,772 --> 00:00:30,339
And if she says no...

14
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:33,775
well, then she
can just ponfo miran.

15
00:00:36,312 --> 00:00:38,480
He didn't mean that.

16
00:01:02,071 --> 00:01:04,940
I think it's so adorable you're
making Sheldon breakfast.

17
00:01:04,942 --> 00:01:07,008
Well, he's having
a rough time.

18
00:01:07,011 --> 00:01:08,410
Amy broke his heart,

19
00:01:08,412 --> 00:01:11,514
the DVR cut off the last minute
of Doctor Who...

20
00:01:11,516 --> 00:01:14,216
that crow followed him home.

21
00:01:15,719 --> 00:01:18,687
Aren't you worried you're making
French toast on oatmeal day?

22
00:01:18,690 --> 00:01:21,257
Ah, well, what's this?
A pot of oatmeal?

23
00:01:21,258 --> 00:01:25,293
Or, thanks to you, what
I will now call "gloatmeal."

24
00:01:25,296 --> 00:01:28,364
Oh, I don't want credit
for that.

25
00:01:29,365 --> 00:01:31,166
Oh, Dr. and Mrs. Hofstadter,

26
00:01:31,168 --> 00:01:33,335
lovely to see you
this fine morning.

27
00:01:33,338 --> 00:01:34,403
You're in a good mood.

28
00:01:34,404 --> 00:01:35,671
Yeah, I am indeed.

29
00:01:35,672 --> 00:01:37,139
I have decided,

30
00:01:37,142 --> 00:01:39,174
instead of wallowing
in sadness about Amy,

31
00:01:39,177 --> 00:01:42,445
it is time that I find myself
a new female companion.

32
00:01:42,446 --> 00:01:43,645
Oh. Good for you.

33
00:01:43,648 --> 00:01:45,148
What brought this on?

34
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:47,517
I realized something—
when Amy was in my life,

35
00:01:47,519 --> 00:01:49,886
I was hyper-focused on my work
and ignored her.

36
00:01:49,888 --> 00:01:51,053
And you don't want

37
00:01:51,055 --> 00:01:53,121
to make the same mistake
with the next woman.

38
00:01:53,124 --> 00:01:55,725
No, I need a new woman
in my life to ignore

39
00:01:55,726 --> 00:01:58,026
so I can hyper-focus
on my work again.

40
00:01:58,029 --> 00:02:00,296
Hey, I made
French toast sticks.

41
00:02:00,297 --> 00:02:01,764
On oatmeal day?

42
00:02:01,766 --> 00:02:04,199
Ah, I also made oatmeal.
Ooh,

43
00:02:04,201 --> 00:02:07,203
that's a lot of carbohydrates
for a man on the prowl.

44
00:02:07,204 --> 00:02:09,272
You know what?
You eat it; you're married—

45
00:02:09,274 --> 00:02:11,641
it doesn't matter
what you look like.

46
00:02:12,842 --> 00:02:16,745

The Mystery Date Observation
Original Air Date on Novembe

56
00:02:41,537 --> 00:02:47,037
== sync, corrected by elderman ==
@elder_man

57
00:02:47,061 --> 00:02:49,062
Thank you for coming by,
gentlemen.

58
00:02:49,065 --> 00:02:50,764
No problem.
So what's up?

59
00:02:50,767 --> 00:02:54,234
Well, it was the two of you who
found Amy Farrah Fowler for me.

60
00:02:54,237 --> 00:02:56,203
Now that I'm looking
for my next girlfriend,

61
00:02:56,204 --> 00:02:59,774
it seemed only logical that I
employ your services once again.

62
00:02:59,775 --> 00:03:02,576
Y-You sure you're up for that?
She did hurt you.

63
00:03:02,578 --> 00:03:05,478
Oh, no, it's all right.
I think of my time with Amy

64
00:03:05,481 --> 00:03:09,115
as a stick of Fruit Stripe gum:
sweet and enjoyable at first,

65
00:03:09,118 --> 00:03:12,786
but ultimately
a flavorless lump of sadness.

66
00:03:13,788 --> 00:03:15,589
You're not wrong
about Fruit Stripe.

67
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:18,958
I-I was always
a Hubba Bubba man. Mm.

68
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:22,095
Hubba Bubba over Dubble Bubble?
You're crazy.

69
00:03:22,097 --> 00:03:25,198
Hey, the jaw wants
what it wants.

70
00:03:25,201 --> 00:03:26,900
Gentlemen!

71
00:03:26,903 --> 00:03:28,803
Oh, right, uh, girlfriend. Okay.

72
00:03:28,804 --> 00:03:30,404
But what are you
looking for?

73
00:03:30,405 --> 00:03:31,772
All I'm looking for

74
00:03:31,773 --> 00:03:34,375
is an educated, intelligent
woman who shares my interests

75
00:03:34,376 --> 00:03:36,376
while retaining
her own unique point of view.

76
00:03:36,379 --> 00:03:37,544
She should be kind,

77
00:03:37,547 --> 00:03:38,679
patient,

78
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:40,047
and most important,

79
00:03:40,049 --> 00:03:44,184
unable to imagine life
without me by 10:00 tonight.

80
00:03:44,186 --> 00:03:46,186
Isn't that
a little unreasonable?

81
00:03:46,189 --> 00:03:47,655
All right, fine,
she doesn't need

82
00:03:47,656 --> 00:03:50,857
her own point of view.
Now, chop-chop.

83
00:03:51,959 --> 00:03:53,861
Come on, Amy,
show us the dress.

84
00:03:53,863 --> 00:03:55,261
Okay.

85
00:03:55,263 --> 00:03:59,867
But I'm really stepping outside
of my comfort zone here.

86
00:04:05,774 --> 00:04:07,107
Uh...

87
00:04:07,109 --> 00:04:10,210
I don't think any of your
comfort zones are showing.

88
00:04:10,213 --> 00:04:11,711
Yeah,

89
00:04:11,714 --> 00:04:13,914
it's your third date— maybe
you could go more sexy.

90
00:04:13,915 --> 00:04:18,018
Well, some people think
the sexiest organ is the brain.

91
00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:19,987
No one ever bought me drinks
at a bar

92
00:04:19,989 --> 00:04:23,023
because my brain
just popped out of my shirt.

93
00:04:23,025 --> 00:04:24,758
Do you have any heels
higher than this?

94
00:04:24,761 --> 00:04:25,926
He's pretty tall.

95
00:04:25,927 --> 00:04:27,294
Ooh.
Ooh, tall!

96
00:04:27,295 --> 00:04:29,429
Finally some details
about this mystery man.

97
00:04:29,431 --> 00:04:31,165
Yeah, come on,
tell us more.

98
00:04:31,167 --> 00:04:33,633
Well, I told you his name
and that he's tall.

99
00:04:33,636 --> 00:04:34,902
What more do you need?

100
00:04:34,903 --> 00:04:36,169
Did you kiss him yet?

101
00:04:36,172 --> 00:04:38,605
Just a little peck on the lips.

102
00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:44,544
Well, we're your best friends—
give us one more detail

103
00:04:44,547 --> 00:04:46,147
and we promise
we'll leave you alone.

104
00:04:46,148 --> 00:04:47,948
Fine. Um...

105
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:49,783
he's British.

106
00:04:52,386 --> 00:04:55,355
All right, that is a juicy one.

107
00:04:55,357 --> 00:04:57,857
All right, where is
Tall British Dave taking you?

108
00:04:57,859 --> 00:05:00,561
Tea and basketball?

109
00:05:00,563 --> 00:05:02,797
To that new Italian place
on Walnut.

110
00:05:02,799 --> 00:05:03,931
Oh, nice.

111
00:05:03,932 --> 00:05:05,766
I'm gonna go look for other shoes.
Good luck.

112
00:05:05,768 --> 00:05:08,201
I threw out all my tall ones
when I married Leonard.

113
00:05:10,371 --> 00:05:11,739
Hey, you want

114
00:05:11,741 --> 00:05:14,008
to swing by that place tonight
and get a look at this guy?

115
00:05:14,009 --> 00:05:16,277
We don't even know what time
they're gonna be there.

116
00:05:16,278 --> 00:05:17,610
I'll just call the restaurant,

117
00:05:17,612 --> 00:05:19,379
pretend I'm Amy
and check the reservation.

118
00:05:19,381 --> 00:05:21,849
Damn, you're sneaky.

119
00:05:21,850 --> 00:05:24,117
Yeah, but I'm little,
so it's adorable.

120
00:05:27,121 --> 00:05:29,989
I think the quickest way
to find you a new girlfriend

121
00:05:29,992 --> 00:05:33,460
is just to get you on every
dating Web site out there.

122
00:05:33,461 --> 00:05:34,794
Are you sure?

123
00:05:34,797 --> 00:05:37,198
I've heard that on those
sites, often when you think

124
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:39,732
you're corresponding with someone,
it's actually a computer program

125
00:05:39,734 --> 00:05:41,768
pretending to be
a real person.

126
00:05:41,770 --> 00:05:45,306
And you're afraid
it'll do a better job than you?

127
00:05:45,307 --> 00:05:47,474
Excuse me.

128
00:05:47,475 --> 00:05:48,475
No one does a better job

129
00:05:48,477 --> 00:05:50,311
pretending to be a person
than I do.

130
00:05:51,412 --> 00:05:54,581
Siri comes close,
but I know more jokes.

131
00:05:54,583 --> 00:05:57,083
If you don't want to
use dating Web sites,

132
00:05:57,085 --> 00:05:58,419
what do you suggest?

133
00:05:58,420 --> 00:06:00,920
Off the top of my head?
Uh, prospective women

134
00:06:00,922 --> 00:06:03,390
weed themselves out
in a battle of wits

135
00:06:03,391 --> 00:06:04,924
until only one champion remains,

136
00:06:04,927 --> 00:06:07,895
she shows up at my door flush
with the thrill of victory,

137
00:06:07,896 --> 00:06:11,965
and then sits quietly by my side
while I watch Daredevil.

138
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:15,268
You seriously think women
would fight for you?

139
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:19,405
People compete for jobs
and trophies— why not me?

140
00:06:19,407 --> 00:06:21,941
He's right— he knows
a lot of jokes.

141
00:06:23,177 --> 00:06:25,612
Yeah— no, but it is
basic human nature.

142
00:06:25,614 --> 00:06:29,415
If we present him as a prize,
maybe they would.

143
00:06:29,417 --> 00:06:31,117
Well, he's smart,

144
00:06:31,119 --> 00:06:32,886
he's a respected
scientist...

145
00:06:32,888 --> 00:06:36,790
And I have
the soulful eyes of a cow.

146
00:06:38,859 --> 00:06:40,927
I don't know
if I'd say you...

147
00:06:40,929 --> 00:06:42,730
Oh.

148
00:06:43,698 --> 00:06:45,032
I have an idea.

149
00:06:45,033 --> 00:06:47,801
What if we put a post
on Craigslist that says:

150
00:06:47,802 --> 00:06:50,703
"World-class Caltech physicist
seeking girlfriend.

151
00:06:50,705 --> 00:06:52,038
"If interested,

152
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:55,342
solve the following puzzles
for a chance to meet him."

153
00:06:55,343 --> 00:06:57,044
Oh, we'll make the puzzles
extremely challenging

154
00:06:57,045 --> 00:06:59,078
to eliminate
unworthy candidates.

155
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:01,448
Oh, we could set it up
like a scavenger hunt where

156
00:07:01,450 --> 00:07:04,285
the last puzzle gives the winner
Sheldon's contact information.

157
00:07:04,287 --> 00:07:06,720
Well, this is actually an
interesting social experiment.

158
00:07:06,722 --> 00:07:08,588
I'm a little jealous of the
people who get to do it.

159
00:07:08,590 --> 00:07:09,590
Me, too.

160
00:07:09,592 --> 00:07:11,424
And we've seen the prize.

161
00:07:15,463 --> 00:07:17,765
I don't understand why we're
leaving so early for the movie.

162
00:07:17,766 --> 00:07:19,967
Oh, I forgot to tell you—
we're gonna meet up

163
00:07:19,968 --> 00:07:22,095
with Bernadette to spy
on Amy and her date.

164
00:07:22,119 --> 00:07:22,836
What?

165
00:07:22,838 --> 00:07:24,405
I don't want to do that.

166
00:07:24,407 --> 00:07:26,205
What, and you think I
want to see a documentary

167
00:07:26,208 --> 00:07:28,174
about aluminum can
recycling?

168
00:07:28,177 --> 00:07:29,576
This is the movie

169
00:07:29,578 --> 00:07:32,513
Big Soda doesn't
want you to see.

170
00:07:32,514 --> 00:07:35,982
No, it's the movie your wife
doesn't want you to see.

171
00:07:36,850 --> 00:07:38,318
So you're actually okay

172
00:07:38,321 --> 00:07:40,254
with invading
your friend's privacy?

173
00:07:40,256 --> 00:07:42,588
You're not curious
who she's out with?

174
00:07:42,590 --> 00:07:43,924
Not really.

175
00:07:43,926 --> 00:07:47,126
But you're curious
about aluminum cans.

176
00:07:48,129 --> 00:07:50,364
You're a weird
little guy.

177
00:07:53,133 --> 00:07:56,102
That's it. The Sheldon Cooper
Girlfriend Challenge

178
00:07:56,105 --> 00:07:58,571
is officially alive.

179
00:07:58,573 --> 00:08:00,306
Congratulations.
This is exciting.

180
00:08:00,309 --> 00:08:01,475
Right now,

181
00:08:01,477 --> 00:08:03,677
somewhere, a woman
is dividing the atomic weight

182
00:08:03,679 --> 00:08:06,213
of the best noble gas
by the number of colors

183
00:08:06,215 --> 00:08:09,215
in the oldest national flag still in use...
W— then using

184
00:08:09,217 --> 00:08:11,617
that number as the average speed
to calculate the travel time

185
00:08:11,619 --> 00:08:13,619
from Mordor to the Shire.
And...

186
00:08:13,621 --> 00:08:15,922
taking her first step
towards a lifetime

187
00:08:15,924 --> 00:08:19,693
of laughter,
love and, best of all, rules.

188
00:08:19,694 --> 00:08:22,720
I-I hope we didn't make
the puzzles too hard.

189
00:08:22,722 --> 00:08:26,033
Well... if she can solve them,
it'll prove she's intelligent,

190
00:08:26,035 --> 00:08:27,835
tenacious and...
so socially awkward

191
00:08:27,836 --> 00:08:30,504
she has nothing better to do
on a Saturday night.

192
00:08:32,273 --> 00:08:35,175
Golly, she sounds
too good to be true.

193
00:08:37,579 --> 00:08:39,513
This is fun.
I haven't dated much

194
00:08:39,514 --> 00:08:41,248
since my divorce.

195
00:08:41,249 --> 00:08:43,316
Well, I'm having
a good time, too.

196
00:08:43,318 --> 00:08:46,452
If you don't mind me asking, why
did you and your wife split up?

197
00:08:46,455 --> 00:08:49,056
Oh, you know how it is—
we wanted different things.

198
00:08:49,057 --> 00:08:50,324
I wanted children,

199
00:08:50,326 --> 00:08:53,627
and she wanted a pastry chef
named Jean-Philippe.

200
00:08:53,629 --> 00:08:56,230
Oh, I'm... I'm so sorry.

201
00:08:56,231 --> 00:08:57,864
No, it's-it's fine.
It's why I left England.

202
00:08:57,866 --> 00:08:59,600
It reminded me
too much of her.

203
00:08:59,601 --> 00:09:04,437
Cold, gloomy and easily accessed
by a Frenchman through a tunnel.

204
00:09:05,907 --> 00:09:08,207
Hey. So, where are they?

205
00:09:08,210 --> 00:09:10,344
Across the street,
in the left window.

206
00:09:10,345 --> 00:09:12,012
Oh, damn it,

207
00:09:12,013 --> 00:09:13,580
we should have brought
binoculars.

208
00:09:13,581 --> 00:09:16,016
Right here.

209
00:09:16,018 --> 00:09:18,552
We just happen to have those
in the car?

210
00:09:18,553 --> 00:09:20,086
Kinda. Before I met Howie,

211
00:09:20,089 --> 00:09:22,556
I liked to keep close tabs
on my boyfriends.

212
00:09:22,557 --> 00:09:24,023
By stalking them?

213
00:09:24,026 --> 00:09:26,125
No. Stalkers
are creepy.

214
00:09:26,128 --> 00:09:28,028
I'm just a harmless little girl

215
00:09:28,029 --> 00:09:30,763
with military-grade
spy equipment.

216
00:09:31,699 --> 00:09:33,066
Oh, there he is.

217
00:09:33,068 --> 00:09:34,401
He's cute, right?

218
00:09:34,403 --> 00:09:36,769
Yeah!
Can I see?

219
00:09:36,772 --> 00:09:39,720
What, now you're interested?
You didn't even want to come.

220
00:09:39,721 --> 00:09:43,577
I know, but you guys make being
a crappy friend look fun.

221
00:09:43,579 --> 00:09:45,678
Fine.

222
00:09:45,681 --> 00:09:47,914
Yeah, okay, I see him.

223
00:09:47,917 --> 00:09:49,516
It looks like
they're having a nice time.

224
00:09:49,518 --> 00:09:50,817
I wish I could hear
what they're saying.

225
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:52,085
Yeah, I should've brought

226
00:09:52,087 --> 00:09:53,253
my parabolic microphone.

227
00:09:53,254 --> 00:09:55,321
Your what?
Nothing. Not important.

228
00:09:56,758 --> 00:09:58,191
So you've never
been married?

229
00:09:58,194 --> 00:10:01,327
No. I mean,
to be completely honest, I've...

230
00:10:01,330 --> 00:10:03,696
I've only been
in one long-term relationship.

231
00:10:03,699 --> 00:10:05,032
Oh. What happened with that?

232
00:10:05,033 --> 00:10:06,600
That's a good question.

233
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:12,787
After five years,

234
00:10:12,788 --> 00:10:15,523
it was just feeling like
more work than it should be.

235
00:10:15,524 --> 00:10:16,657
Oh, that's too bad.

236
00:10:16,658 --> 00:10:18,258
Was he a neurobiologist
like you?

237
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:20,595
No. He's a theoretical physicist

238
00:10:20,596 --> 00:10:23,531
at Caltech.

239
00:10:23,532 --> 00:10:26,466
I love teaching math, but
that would be my dream job.

240
00:10:26,469 --> 00:10:27,734
What's his focus?

241
00:10:27,736 --> 00:10:31,071
Um... used to be string theory,
now it's dark matter.

242
00:10:31,074 --> 00:10:33,139
But... let's
not discuss Sheldon.

243
00:10:33,142 --> 00:10:35,042
Let's get back to you.

244
00:10:35,043 --> 00:10:38,512
Wait, you're not talking
about Dr. Sheldon Cooper?

245
00:10:39,781 --> 00:10:43,116
I'm trying not to.

246
00:10:43,951 --> 00:10:45,018
Do you know him?

247
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:47,455
No, but I've followed
his work for years.

248
00:10:47,456 --> 00:10:48,623
He's a rock star.

249
00:10:48,624 --> 00:10:50,423
You've got to
tell me about him.

250
00:10:50,426 --> 00:10:52,225
What's he like?

251
00:10:54,562 --> 00:10:57,364
He really seems into her.

252
00:10:58,834 --> 00:11:00,634
I took a video.

253
00:11:00,637 --> 00:11:03,504
I forgot how much
fun this is.

254
00:11:03,505 --> 00:11:04,805
Okay, we saw them.

255
00:11:04,806 --> 00:11:06,507
Can we go catch the movie?

256
00:11:06,508 --> 00:11:08,576
Why'd you bring him?

257
00:11:08,577 --> 00:11:11,177
I had to; we're married now.

258
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:13,247
Ugh, I hear that.

259
00:11:21,984 --> 00:11:24,353
I'm sorry, just one more
question about Sheldon.

260
00:11:24,355 --> 00:11:26,455
Sure, why not?

261
00:11:26,456 --> 00:11:29,057
It's more of a four-part
question, really.

262
00:11:30,493 --> 00:11:33,028
When he wrote his paper on
supersingular prime numbers,

263
00:11:33,029 --> 00:11:34,596
how long did it take?

264
00:11:35,431 --> 00:11:37,398
Um... about an hour and half.

265
00:11:37,401 --> 00:11:38,734
Wow!

266
00:11:40,236 --> 00:11:41,836
I mean, wow!

267
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:43,839
And you were
there to see it?

268
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:47,042
Yes. Yep. We were on a date.

269
00:11:48,278 --> 00:11:51,312
Very much like this one.
Mm.

270
00:11:51,315 --> 00:11:53,047
I doubt it was
like this one.

271
00:11:53,050 --> 00:11:55,783
I mean, he's a genius, and
I wasn't even smart enough

272
00:11:55,786 --> 00:11:59,355
to figure out why my wife
always smelled of croissants.

273
00:11:59,356 --> 00:12:01,990
What was the rest
of your question?

274
00:12:01,993 --> 00:12:03,167
Do you think you could
introduce me to him?

275
00:12:03,191 --> 00:12:04,561
Really?

276
00:12:04,561 --> 00:12:07,363
You-you want me to introduce you
to my ex-boyfriend?

277
00:12:07,364 --> 00:12:09,297
You're right,
it's-it's weird.

278
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:11,233
No, wait. Do it.

279
00:12:12,701 --> 00:12:14,135
No. I changed my mind.

280
00:12:14,138 --> 00:12:15,937
I'd be too nervous.

281
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:18,507
Oh! I don't know
what to do.

282
00:12:19,508 --> 00:12:20,843
Are we gonna be much longer?

283
00:12:20,845 --> 00:12:22,878
I really have
to go to the bathroom.

284
00:12:22,879 --> 00:12:25,080
Right here.

285
00:12:27,951 --> 00:12:31,820
37 minutes left
until the deadline.

286
00:12:31,821 --> 00:12:34,023
Someone will show.

287
00:12:34,024 --> 00:12:37,393
And no matter what happens,
this is still a fun experiment.

288
00:12:37,394 --> 00:12:40,962
Not as fun as the night we
blew up grapes in the microwave.

289
00:12:41,697 --> 00:12:44,266
We really have led full lives.

290
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:46,402
Someone will show.

291
00:12:46,403 --> 00:12:47,869
Maybe you don't want

292
00:12:47,872 --> 00:12:49,037
someone exactly like you.

293
00:12:49,039 --> 00:12:50,939
You know what they say:
opposites attract.

294
00:12:50,941 --> 00:12:52,874
Well, by that logic,

295
00:12:52,877 --> 00:12:56,345
I should be with someone short,
dull and needy, eh?

296
00:12:56,346 --> 00:12:57,745
Not to cast aspersions,

297
00:12:57,748 --> 00:13:02,051
but I can't shake a stick around
here without hitting that.

298
00:13:05,888 --> 00:13:08,523
You know, I once
drove 500 miles

299
00:13:08,526 --> 00:13:11,493
to hear him speak
at Stanford.

300
00:13:11,494 --> 00:13:14,495
I have a DVD of that lecture.

301
00:13:14,498 --> 00:13:16,498
Really? Wasn't it great?

302
00:13:16,499 --> 00:13:20,134
Not as a Valentine's
present, no.

303
00:13:20,137 --> 00:13:21,869
Well, the next time
you watch it,

304
00:13:21,872 --> 00:13:23,638
I'm the bloke who
asked the question

305
00:13:23,641 --> 00:13:26,642
that he said was
stupid and obvious.

306
00:13:26,643 --> 00:13:29,945
It was the nicest thing
he said to anyone there.

307
00:13:29,946 --> 00:13:31,779
That's, um, terrific.

308
00:13:31,782 --> 00:13:34,649
Listen, I'm-I'm kind of tired.
Can we call it a night?

309
00:13:34,652 --> 00:13:37,052
Oh, gosh. Sorry,
I've just spent the whole night

310
00:13:37,053 --> 00:13:39,020
talking about your ex-boyfriend.

311
00:13:39,023 --> 00:13:40,422
I'm such an idiot.

312
00:13:40,423 --> 00:13:42,358
No, you're not.

313
00:13:42,359 --> 00:13:45,293
Well, maybe not an idiot,
but certainly not as smart as...

314
00:13:45,296 --> 00:13:47,061
someone we won't mention.

315
00:13:47,064 --> 00:13:49,064
Thank you.
But you said

316
00:13:49,066 --> 00:13:51,300
you might introduce me to him—
I'm free on Thursday.

317
00:13:52,869 --> 00:13:54,436
Hey, hey,
they're leaving.

318
00:13:54,437 --> 00:13:57,272
What? Here,
give me, give me.

319
00:13:57,273 --> 00:13:59,874
Oh, my God. Oh, my God,
they're coming right towards us.

320
00:13:59,877 --> 00:14:02,945
We got to get out of here.
Okay. Well, wait, what about Leonard?

321
00:14:02,946 --> 00:14:05,980
He and his tiny bladder
can take the bus!

322
00:14:10,186 --> 00:14:11,387
Oh, no!

323
00:14:15,825 --> 00:14:18,159
She just hit my car!

324
00:14:18,162 --> 00:14:20,229
What are you guys
doing here?

325
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:24,199
Oh! Hey, Ames!
What are you doing here?

326
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:26,435
What happened?

327
00:14:27,269 --> 00:14:28,504
OMG!

328
00:14:28,505 --> 00:14:30,439
Aren't you
Leonard Hofstadter?

329
00:14:30,441 --> 00:14:31,940
Yeah.

330
00:14:31,941 --> 00:14:34,676
I saw you speak at Stanford
with Sheldon Cooper!

331
00:14:34,677 --> 00:14:37,345
Amy, can you believe it?
It's Dr. Leonard Hofstadter!

332
00:14:39,349 --> 00:14:41,517
No. Pinch me.

333
00:14:41,518 --> 00:14:44,253
It's an absolute pleasure to meet you.
Can I shake your hand?

334
00:14:44,254 --> 00:14:46,254
I don't know if you want
to do that— I was just...

335
00:14:46,257 --> 00:14:47,822
Okay, never mind.

336
00:14:48,657 --> 00:14:50,725
Amy, I'm never washing
this hand again.

337
00:14:50,728 --> 00:14:53,394
You really should.

338
00:14:54,564 --> 00:14:57,231
60 seconds.

339
00:14:57,234 --> 00:14:58,499
This is not looking good.

340
00:14:58,502 --> 00:15:00,469
One minute is
a long time.

341
00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:03,504
I've been telling women that
for 20 years.

342
00:15:06,176 --> 00:15:08,911
45.
45 seconds is

343
00:15:08,912 --> 00:15:11,245
plenty of time for a woman
to walk through that door

344
00:15:11,248 --> 00:15:12,614
and fall in love with me.

345
00:15:12,615 --> 00:15:15,716
You know, probably half that
if I break out the old cow eyes.

346
00:15:16,552 --> 00:15:18,019
30 seconds.

347
00:15:18,022 --> 00:15:19,488
Uh-oh.

348
00:15:19,489 --> 00:15:22,090
What if it's Jennifer Lawrence?

349
00:15:22,091 --> 00:15:23,358
What?

350
00:15:23,359 --> 00:15:25,661
Oh, that last Hunger Games
was not my cup of tea.

351
00:15:25,662 --> 00:15:28,564
You thought she was great
in X-Men.

352
00:15:28,566 --> 00:15:29,998
Oh, fine— I won't shut my heart

353
00:15:29,999 --> 00:15:31,600
to the love
of Jennifer Lawrence.

354
00:15:32,835 --> 00:15:35,883
Guys, 15 seconds.
Maybe she's waiting to show up

355
00:15:35,883 --> 00:15:37,673
at the last possible moment.

356
00:15:37,675 --> 00:15:39,041
Sounds like a drama queen.

357
00:15:39,042 --> 00:15:42,911
Oh, no.
It is Jennifer Lawrence.

358
00:15:43,645 --> 00:15:44,446
Five...

359
00:15:44,447 --> 00:15:45,814
four...

360
00:15:45,816 --> 00:15:47,416
three...

361
00:15:47,417 --> 00:15:49,250
two...

362
00:15:49,253 --> 00:15:50,652
one.

363
00:15:55,057 --> 00:15:56,959
That's too bad.

364
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:59,460
Maybe we did make the test
too difficult.

365
00:15:59,462 --> 00:16:01,263
I don't think it matters.
Look, Sheldon,

366
00:16:01,264 --> 00:16:04,199
I believe when the time is right
for you to meet someone,

367
00:16:04,201 --> 00:16:05,533
it'll just happen.

368
00:16:05,536 --> 00:16:08,202
Okay? Not because of
a test or a Web site,

369
00:16:08,205 --> 00:16:10,404
but because...

370
00:16:10,407 --> 00:16:13,642
We are the dreamers of dreams!

371
00:16:19,382 --> 00:16:21,950
It's an actual girl,
and she's really pretty.

372
00:16:21,951 --> 00:16:23,784
Answer it!

373
00:16:23,787 --> 00:16:25,254
All right.

374
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:32,793
Can I help you?

375
00:16:32,796 --> 00:16:36,064
Um, a-are you the physicist that
placed the ad on Craigslist?

376
00:16:36,066 --> 00:16:37,199
Yes.

377
00:16:37,201 --> 00:16:39,301
Hi. I'm Vanessa Bennett.

378
00:16:39,302 --> 00:16:41,168
Sorry it took a while
for me to get here.

379
00:16:41,171 --> 00:16:42,671
I was stuck in this
boring symposium

380
00:16:42,672 --> 00:16:45,273
on atomic spectroscopy
when I came across your ad,

381
00:16:45,276 --> 00:16:46,774
and it saved my night.

382
00:16:46,777 --> 00:16:48,576
The puzzles were...
were really fun.

383
00:16:48,579 --> 00:16:50,678
I've never had
to translate Klingon

384
00:16:50,681 --> 00:16:53,882
into ancient Sanskrit before.

385
00:16:53,883 --> 00:16:55,584
Well...

386
00:16:55,585 --> 00:16:58,787
careful, hmm, it's addictive.

387
00:16:58,788 --> 00:17:02,790
Chija'e'vlKub je.

388
00:17:04,928 --> 00:17:07,194
Or, as they say
in Sanskrit...

389
00:17:08,096 --> 00:17:11,066
Ahm asman matey-bee
ta-teyva.

390
00:17:11,067 --> 00:17:15,037
And just like that, you're
a Klingon-Sanskrit junkie.

391
00:17:15,038 --> 00:17:18,006
Anyway, I-I just... I knew
I had to meet the person

392
00:17:18,008 --> 00:17:20,174
responsible for such
a brilliant idea.

393
00:17:20,176 --> 00:17:22,710
And I don't need to tell you,
there aren't a lot of men

394
00:17:22,712 --> 00:17:26,515
who love physics, archaic languages
and flags of the world.

395
00:17:26,517 --> 00:17:29,183
I am a bit of a unicorn.

396
00:17:29,185 --> 00:17:31,153
Well, you certainly seem

397
00:17:31,154 --> 00:17:33,689
like a special lady,
uh, but as you know,

398
00:17:33,691 --> 00:17:36,357
you missed the deadline,
so thanks for playing.

399
00:17:43,633 --> 00:17:45,834
How could you
send her away?

400
00:17:45,835 --> 00:17:48,002
She was late.

401
00:17:48,005 --> 00:17:49,037
And...

402
00:17:49,038 --> 00:17:51,206
she found
atomic spectroscopy boring.

403
00:17:51,208 --> 00:17:54,910
Well, I wouldn't coitus her
with your genitals.

404
00:18:03,818 --> 00:18:06,185
Uh, thanks
for driving me home.

405
00:18:06,188 --> 00:18:07,653
No problem.

406
00:18:07,655 --> 00:18:09,256
I'm really sorry about your car.

407
00:18:09,258 --> 00:18:10,556
Oh, it's all right.

408
00:18:10,558 --> 00:18:13,293
If you're free next weekend,
I'd love to take you out again.

409
00:18:13,295 --> 00:18:16,229
Um... listen,
you're a really nice guy,

410
00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:19,499
but I just... I don't think
this is working out.

411
00:18:20,367 --> 00:18:21,668
Oh. Okay.

412
00:18:21,670 --> 00:18:22,801
I'm...

413
00:18:22,804 --> 00:18:24,304
I'm really sorry.

414
00:18:24,306 --> 00:18:26,472
No, it's...
at least the same woman

415
00:18:26,474 --> 00:18:29,843
that rejected Sheldon Cooper
rejected me.

416
00:18:31,278 --> 00:18:34,847
There you go.

417
00:18:34,849 --> 00:18:37,584
If I ever do meet him,
we'll have that in common.

418
00:18:37,585 --> 00:18:38,919
Sure. Heh.

419
00:18:38,921 --> 00:18:40,886
And... he's kissed you
and I've kissed you,

420
00:18:40,889 --> 00:18:43,227
so if you think about it...
Okay, get out.

421
