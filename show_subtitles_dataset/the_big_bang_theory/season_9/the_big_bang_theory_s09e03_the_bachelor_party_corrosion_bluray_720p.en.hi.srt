1
00:00:01,446 --> 00:00:03,047
Would you pass
the mustard?

2
00:00:03,049 --> 00:00:04,148
Sure.

3
00:00:04,150 --> 00:00:05,983
Hey, want to hear
a fun fact about mustard?

4
00:00:05,985 --> 00:00:08,886
Is it that the glucosinolates
which give mustard its flavor

5
00:00:08,889 --> 00:00:10,254
were evolved
by the cabbage family

6
00:00:10,257 --> 00:00:12,891
as a chemical defense
against caterpillars?

7
00:00:12,892 --> 00:00:14,526
Yeah.

8
00:00:15,895 --> 00:00:17,695
Well, that was fun.

9
00:00:17,698 --> 00:00:19,831
Good for you, Leonard.

10
00:00:19,832 --> 00:00:21,366
Hey, there.

11
00:00:21,367 --> 00:00:22,367
Hey, you're early.

12
00:00:22,369 --> 00:00:24,102
The movie doesn't start
for an hour.

13
00:00:24,103 --> 00:00:25,736
Actually, we're not
going to the movies.

14
00:00:25,739 --> 00:00:28,405
We are here to kidnap you.

15
00:00:28,407 --> 00:00:29,741
What are you talking about?

16
00:00:29,742 --> 00:00:31,543
Well, you eloped and
we didn't get a chance

17
00:00:31,544 --> 00:00:32,977
to throw you
a bachelor party,

18
00:00:32,979 --> 00:00:34,511
so there's
a van downstairs

19
00:00:34,514 --> 00:00:36,147
and we're here
to take you

20
00:00:36,148 --> 00:00:38,148
to a surprise location
for the weekend.

21
00:00:38,151 --> 00:00:40,318
Well, I'd hardly
call this kidnapping.

22
00:00:40,319 --> 00:00:41,486
Where's the blindfold?

23
00:00:41,487 --> 00:00:42,721
Where's the duct tape?

24
00:00:42,723 --> 00:00:44,288
Where's the part

25
00:00:44,291 --> 00:00:46,023
where you call me
and demand ransom

26
00:00:46,026 --> 00:00:47,525
and I try to keep you
on the phone,

27
00:00:47,526 --> 00:00:49,794
but you hang up
seconds before I can trace it

28
00:00:49,795 --> 00:00:53,163
and then I say, "I'm getting
too old for this crud"?

29
00:00:55,334 --> 00:00:57,401
When do we leave?

30
00:00:57,404 --> 00:00:58,336
Right now.

31
00:00:58,337 --> 00:00:59,703
Yeah, Penny packed
you a bag.

32
00:00:59,706 --> 00:01:01,272
Wow, okay.

33
00:01:01,273 --> 00:01:03,174
You're seriously going to get
in a van and let these two

34
00:01:03,175 --> 00:01:04,442
take you
to an unknown destination

35
00:01:04,443 --> 00:01:05,909
for an entire weekend?

36
00:01:05,912 --> 00:01:07,811
Oh, not just him;
you're coming, too.

37
00:01:07,814 --> 00:01:10,448
Oh, and how do you think you're
going to get me to do that?

38
00:01:10,450 --> 00:01:11,483
Unhand me!

39
00:01:11,484 --> 00:01:12,517
This is ridiculous!

40
00:01:12,519 --> 00:01:14,052
I told you to put tape
on his mouth!

41
00:01:14,053 --> 00:01:16,254

@elder_man

52
00:01:46,754 --> 00:01:49,187
It's bad enough I'm being taken

53
00:01:49,189 --> 00:01:50,333
against my will.

54
00:01:50,334 --> 00:01:51,734
I don't see why it has to be in

55
00:01:51,737 --> 00:01:53,636
some hippie's
mobile sex dungeon.

56
00:01:55,106 --> 00:01:57,073
Well, Sheldon,
there's something about this van

57
00:01:57,076 --> 00:01:59,175
that you're going to find
very interesting.

58
00:01:59,177 --> 00:02:01,978
It runs on syphilis?

59
00:02:03,513 --> 00:02:06,615
This van was owned
and driven by your personal

60
00:02:06,618 --> 00:02:07,951
physics hero...

61
00:02:07,952 --> 00:02:09,518
Richard Feynman.

62
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,421
No.
Yeah!

63
00:02:11,423 --> 00:02:13,190
A buddy of mine
let me borrow it.

64
00:02:13,191 --> 00:02:14,958
This was Feynman's van?

65
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:16,125
That's so cool.

66
00:02:16,127 --> 00:02:17,761
Yeah, nothing's been changed
since he drove it.

67
00:02:17,762 --> 00:02:20,464
I bet he picked up a lot of cute
grad students in this bad boy.

68
00:02:20,465 --> 00:02:22,499
Yeah, and talked about physics
with them!

69
00:02:24,903 --> 00:02:26,903
So, are you gonna give us
a clue where we're headed?

70
00:02:26,904 --> 00:02:29,839
Uh, okay, let's see...

71
00:02:29,841 --> 00:02:31,507
They've got spicy food

72
00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:34,511
and there's a chance
you'll get diarrhea.

73
00:02:34,512 --> 00:02:37,847
India.

74
00:02:37,850 --> 00:02:39,983
We can drive there.

75
00:02:39,984 --> 00:02:41,817
Your house?

76
00:02:43,387 --> 00:02:45,988
We are going
to Meh-he-co!

77
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:47,156
Fun, I've never been there!

78
00:02:47,159 --> 00:02:48,992
Leonard, don't be fooled!

79
00:02:48,993 --> 00:02:50,293
I'm from Texas—

80
00:02:50,294 --> 00:02:53,762
Meh-he-co is Spanish for Mexico.

81
00:02:53,764 --> 00:02:55,665
What's wrong with Mexico?

82
00:02:55,666 --> 00:02:58,334
Uh, mariachi bands, wild dogs,

83
00:02:58,337 --> 00:03:01,671
beans that jump around
'cause there's a worm inside.

84
00:03:01,673 --> 00:03:03,305
Okay, calm down.

85
00:03:03,308 --> 00:03:04,573
There's a theme
to this weekend.

86
00:03:04,576 --> 00:03:08,144
We are going to Mexico
in Feynman's van

87
00:03:08,147 --> 00:03:10,613
to stay at the vacation house
Feynman bought

88
00:03:10,615 --> 00:03:12,482
with the money
from his Nobel Prize.

89
00:03:12,483 --> 00:03:14,117
Viva la Imodium!

90
00:03:14,119 --> 00:03:15,651
Ay-ay-ay!

91
00:03:18,722 --> 00:03:21,157
Come on, Leonard's
doing bachelor stuff.

92
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:22,893
You sure we can't take
you to a strip club?

93
00:03:22,894 --> 00:03:25,595
Nah, if I want to see
a naked dancing man,

94
00:03:25,596 --> 00:03:27,530
I just flush the toilet
while Leonard's in the shower.

95
00:03:30,668 --> 00:03:33,102
Hi.
Hey.

96
00:03:33,105 --> 00:03:35,204
I know we're not making a fuss,

97
00:03:35,207 --> 00:03:38,141
but in the spirit
of bachelorette parties,

98
00:03:38,142 --> 00:03:41,511
I made cookies in the
shape of male genitals.

99
00:03:42,579 --> 00:03:44,481
You really
didn't have to...

100
00:03:44,483 --> 00:03:46,382
Whoa!

101
00:03:47,351 --> 00:03:49,719
That is anatomic.

102
00:03:49,721 --> 00:03:50,887
Thank you.

103
00:03:50,888 --> 00:03:52,856
The veins are gummy worms.

104
00:03:56,093 --> 00:03:57,726
Oh, look,

105
00:03:57,728 --> 00:04:00,429
Jewish and gentile.

106
00:04:01,264 --> 00:04:02,999
I had extra dough.

107
00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:07,137
Oh, that's Leonard.

108
00:04:07,138 --> 00:04:08,537
He said they're about
to cross the border.

109
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:11,107
I hope the boys don't get
too crazy in Mexico.

110
00:04:11,108 --> 00:04:13,008
Oh, yeah, right.
Lock up your daughters

111
00:04:13,011 --> 00:04:14,344
or Sheldon might
lecture them

112
00:04:14,346 --> 00:04:16,546
about the North American
Free Trade Agreement.

113
00:04:17,848 --> 00:04:21,117
Boy, that was
a long night for me.

114
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,853
Uh-oh.

115
00:04:24,856 --> 00:04:27,257
According to this
Mexican Customs Web site,

116
00:04:27,259 --> 00:04:30,360
visitors may not bring
more than five laser discs,

117
00:04:30,361 --> 00:04:32,262
20 compact discs

118
00:04:32,264 --> 00:04:35,165
or 12 VHS tapes.

119
00:04:35,166 --> 00:04:37,968
We don't have
any of those.

120
00:04:37,969 --> 00:04:39,536
How can you be sure?

121
00:04:39,538 --> 00:04:42,772
VHS was king
when Feynman drove this van.

122
00:04:42,774 --> 00:04:44,740
For all we know,
there are hidden compartments

123
00:04:44,743 --> 00:04:47,577
lousy with Jane Fonda
workout videos.

124
00:04:47,579 --> 00:04:49,779
If there was
a hidden compartment,

125
00:04:49,781 --> 00:04:52,615
don't you think you'd be
stuffed in it by now?

126
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:57,253
Are we all up to date on our
yellow fever inoculations?

127
00:04:57,255 --> 00:05:00,757
You don't need a yellow fever
shot to go to Mexico.

128
00:05:00,759 --> 00:05:02,224
You can never be too careful.

129
00:05:02,226 --> 00:05:05,462
I got one last year
before I went to Epcot.

130
00:05:08,365 --> 00:05:09,865
So, Penny,
how's married life?

131
00:05:09,868 --> 00:05:10,966
Oh, it's good.

132
00:05:10,969 --> 00:05:12,601
I just wish Leonard
would work up the courage

133
00:05:12,603 --> 00:05:15,171
to tell Sheldon
he's moving in here.

134
00:05:15,173 --> 00:05:17,306
You guys still aren't
living together?

135
00:05:17,308 --> 00:05:19,276
We are. I mean, he sleeps here.

136
00:05:19,277 --> 00:05:20,709
But it's only a matter of time

137
00:05:20,712 --> 00:05:22,045
before Sheldon has a bad dream

138
00:05:22,046 --> 00:05:23,279
and tries to climb into bed

139
00:05:23,281 --> 00:05:25,949
with the Leonard-shaped
pile of pillows.

140
00:05:26,817 --> 00:05:28,584
Speaking of Sheldon,

141
00:05:28,587 --> 00:05:29,819
how's single life treating you?

142
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:31,620
Fine, I guess.

143
00:05:31,623 --> 00:05:33,188
I've been focusing on me.

144
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:35,157
I was thinking about
changing my wardrobe.

145
00:05:35,159 --> 00:05:37,260
Yes!
Good for you!

146
00:05:38,428 --> 00:05:40,930
But then I decided I don't want
to go changing who I am

147
00:05:40,931 --> 00:05:42,231
just because of some man.

148
00:05:42,233 --> 00:05:45,101
Yes.
Good for you.

149
00:05:46,404 --> 00:05:47,536
You know, it is normal

150
00:05:47,538 --> 00:05:49,238
to want to change your
look after a breakup.

151
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:52,075
Actually, I was thinking
of making one small change.

152
00:05:52,077 --> 00:05:53,409
Your sweater?
Your glasses?

153
00:05:53,411 --> 00:05:54,978
Your hair?
Your shoes!

154
00:05:54,979 --> 00:05:57,079
Piercing my ears.

155
00:05:57,082 --> 00:05:58,748
Oh.
Oh.

156
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:00,216
You really never
had that done?

157
00:06:00,217 --> 00:06:01,685
My mom said pierced ears

158
00:06:01,687 --> 00:06:04,654
were for whores,
pirates and genies.

159
00:06:05,856 --> 00:06:08,325
Okay, well, you're
a grown woman now.

160
00:06:08,327 --> 00:06:10,993
I know, but Sheldon
had this clause

161
00:06:10,995 --> 00:06:12,329
in the Relationship Agreement

162
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:13,697
forbidding cosmetic surgery

163
00:06:13,699 --> 00:06:16,065
unless it's to look
like a Klingon.

164
00:06:17,468 --> 00:06:19,168
We'll take you to the
mall to get it done.

165
00:06:19,171 --> 00:06:20,736
Why? I can do it
right here.

166
00:06:20,738 --> 00:06:21,771
Really?

167
00:06:21,772 --> 00:06:23,305
You have a piercing gun?
No.

168
00:06:23,308 --> 00:06:24,740
All you need is a needle
and an ice cube.

169
00:06:24,743 --> 00:06:26,075
I've done it, like,
a dozen times.

170
00:06:26,077 --> 00:06:27,644
Oh, I don't know.

171
00:06:27,646 --> 00:06:29,378
Oh, come on.
I'll be gentle.

172
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:31,548
Let me take your ear virginity.

173
00:06:33,084 --> 00:06:35,918
This party's weird.

174
00:06:38,322 --> 00:06:39,889
Hey, watch your speed.

175
00:06:39,891 --> 00:06:41,423
I hear the Mexican police
target tourists.

176
00:06:41,425 --> 00:06:43,392
Oh, not a problem.

177
00:06:43,394 --> 00:06:44,560
If anything goes down,

178
00:06:44,562 --> 00:06:46,329
we just put Koothrappali
in the driver's seat

179
00:06:46,330 --> 00:06:49,332
and slap a sombrero
on his head.

180
00:06:49,334 --> 00:06:53,135
Dude, how many races can you
offend in a single breath?

181
00:06:53,137 --> 00:06:54,269
I don't know.

182
00:06:54,272 --> 00:06:56,505
Have you watched
the Olympics with me?

183
00:06:57,608 --> 00:06:59,808
Sheldon, can you believe
that we're driving in a van

184
00:06:59,810 --> 00:07:01,810
that was owned by one of
the greatest scientific minds

185
00:07:01,812 --> 00:07:03,546
of the 20th century?

186
00:07:03,548 --> 00:07:04,947
It's like the Batmobile.

187
00:07:05,683 --> 00:07:07,317
If Batman was real

188
00:07:07,319 --> 00:07:08,784
and a physicist

189
00:07:08,786 --> 00:07:11,521
and his car wasn't cool.

190
00:07:11,522 --> 00:07:13,389
It is extraordinary.

191
00:07:13,392 --> 00:07:16,392
Perhaps some of his mojo
will rub off on us.

192
00:07:16,394 --> 00:07:18,795
Maybe between this
and his beach house,

193
00:07:18,796 --> 00:07:20,897
we will be inspired
to greatness.

194
00:07:20,899 --> 00:07:24,032
I usually don't put too much
stock in charms and talismans.

195
00:07:24,034 --> 00:07:25,468
However, even I must admit

196
00:07:25,469 --> 00:07:27,070
feeling Richard Feynman's

197
00:07:27,072 --> 00:07:30,673
butt dent cupping
my own bottom...

198
00:07:30,675 --> 00:07:33,510
that does get
the creative juices flowing.

199
00:07:34,878 --> 00:07:36,546
Hey, I have to return this van.

200
00:07:36,548 --> 00:07:38,981
Keep your creative juices
in your pants.

201
00:07:40,685 --> 00:07:41,750
What was that?

202
00:07:41,752 --> 00:07:43,385
I think it's a tire.

203
00:07:43,387 --> 00:07:45,889
What if it's banditos
shooting at us?

204
00:07:45,891 --> 00:07:47,257
What if we get kidnapped?

205
00:07:47,258 --> 00:07:49,925
What if we end up in a factory
making Bart Simpson piñatas

206
00:07:49,928 --> 00:07:52,195
for the rest of our lives?

207
00:07:52,197 --> 00:07:54,363
It's the tire.

208
00:07:55,231 --> 00:07:56,365
Leonard?

209
00:07:56,368 --> 00:07:57,399
What?

210
00:07:57,401 --> 00:07:59,969
I am getting too old
for this crud.

211
00:08:02,973 --> 00:08:05,541
Amy, I noticed
your status still says

212
00:08:05,543 --> 00:08:07,976
"in a relationship"
on Facebook.

213
00:08:07,978 --> 00:08:09,411
You're right.

214
00:08:09,413 --> 00:08:11,613
I should probably let
all of my Facebook friends know.

215
00:08:11,615 --> 00:08:15,385
Penny, I'm no longer
in a relationship.

216
00:08:16,921 --> 00:08:19,087
Did you change yours
to "married" yet?

217
00:08:19,089 --> 00:08:20,522
Uh, no, not yet.

218
00:08:20,524 --> 00:08:22,558
There's still a few people
I haven't told personally.

219
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:23,625
Who?

220
00:08:23,627 --> 00:08:25,127
Oh, just my parents

221
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:26,628
and my entire family.

222
00:08:26,630 --> 00:08:28,397
What?

223
00:08:28,399 --> 00:08:29,466
Why?

224
00:08:29,468 --> 00:08:30,900
Well, I don't want
to hurt my dad.

225
00:08:30,901 --> 00:08:32,100
You know, he always wanted

226
00:08:32,103 --> 00:08:33,770
to dance with his daughter
at her wedding.

227
00:08:33,772 --> 00:08:35,305
What about
your sister's wedding?

228
00:08:35,306 --> 00:08:38,273
They started to,
then her water broke.

229
00:08:39,443 --> 00:08:41,344
You know, if he finds out
we eloped,

230
00:08:41,345 --> 00:08:42,512
it's gonna break his heart.

231
00:08:42,513 --> 00:08:44,347
How long do you think
you can keep it from him?

232
00:08:44,349 --> 00:08:47,182
Yeah, isn't it gonna get
worse the longer you wait?

233
00:08:47,185 --> 00:08:48,718
Well, not necessarily.

234
00:08:48,719 --> 00:08:50,552
You know,
Dad's not getting any younger,

235
00:08:50,555 --> 00:08:52,155
so if I wait long enough,

236
00:08:52,156 --> 00:08:53,922
I'll just tell him
he walked me down the aisle

237
00:08:53,925 --> 00:08:55,458
and it was magical.

238
00:09:00,598 --> 00:09:02,765
When did you learn
how to change a tire?

239
00:09:02,767 --> 00:09:05,133
Every self-respecting gentleman
should know how

240
00:09:05,136 --> 00:09:07,436
in case he comes across
a damsel in distress

241
00:09:07,439 --> 00:09:08,938
by the side of the road.

242
00:09:10,273 --> 00:09:11,440
If I see one scorpion,

243
00:09:11,443 --> 00:09:12,809
I am getting
on someone's shoulders

244
00:09:12,810 --> 00:09:14,844
and never coming down.

245
00:09:14,845 --> 00:09:17,079
And there's your damsel.

246
00:09:18,415 --> 00:09:20,782
Wow, this one's really stuck.

247
00:09:20,785 --> 00:09:22,417
Are you turning
it the right way?

248
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:23,987
No.

249
00:09:23,988 --> 00:09:25,254
I took the other four off

250
00:09:25,257 --> 00:09:26,788
and when I got to this one,
I thought,

251
00:09:26,791 --> 00:09:28,657
"You know, I'm in a rut.
Let's shake things up."

252
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:30,526
Here, let me try.

253
00:09:37,001 --> 00:09:39,768
You're right, it doesn't turn
the other way.

254
00:09:50,709 --> 00:09:52,210
There you go.

255
00:09:52,211 --> 00:09:53,176
You're all done!

256
00:09:53,179 --> 00:09:54,612
That wasn't so bad.

257
00:09:55,915 --> 00:09:57,515
Nice.

258
00:09:57,517 --> 00:09:59,517
Boy, if my mom could see me now,

259
00:09:59,518 --> 00:10:02,119
she'd lock me in the sin closet.

260
00:10:04,189 --> 00:10:05,623
That's a joke, right?

261
00:10:05,624 --> 00:10:07,325
Actually, the joke was on her.

262
00:10:07,326 --> 00:10:09,426
I could still see the TV
through the slats.

263
00:10:10,496 --> 00:10:11,996
I'm starting to see

264
00:10:11,998 --> 00:10:14,065
why you and your mom
aren't very close.

265
00:10:14,833 --> 00:10:15,967
Bet she'd still tell her

266
00:10:15,969 --> 00:10:17,068
if she got married.

267
00:10:17,070 --> 00:10:19,036
You're not gonna
let this go, are you?

268
00:10:19,038 --> 00:10:20,972
Well, it's kind of sad
that they don't know.

269
00:10:20,974 --> 00:10:22,607
I mean, they love Leonard.

270
00:10:22,608 --> 00:10:23,874
Fine, you want
me to call?

271
00:10:23,877 --> 00:10:25,008
I'll call.

272
00:10:26,579 --> 00:10:28,146
Why am I so nervous?

273
00:10:28,147 --> 00:10:29,413
It's understandable.

274
00:10:29,416 --> 00:10:32,150
Amy was afraid to tell her mom
she broke up with Sheldon.

275
00:10:32,151 --> 00:10:33,318
Yeah?
How did it go?

276
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,584
Did she make you crawl

277
00:10:34,586 --> 00:10:36,119
into the breaking-up drawer?

278
00:10:37,756 --> 00:10:39,357
Uh, well, actually,
to be honest...

279
00:10:39,358 --> 00:10:40,916
I-I haven't told her yet.

280
00:10:40,917 --> 00:10:42,685
You've been giving me
a hard time

281
00:10:42,685 --> 00:10:44,652
and you haven't even told
your mom about Sheldon?

282
00:10:45,022 --> 00:10:46,821
I'm feeling a little dizzy
from all the blood loss.

283
00:10:46,823 --> 00:10:48,455
I don't know
what you're talking about.

284
00:10:50,526 --> 00:10:52,259
Fine. I'm calling home,

285
00:10:52,262 --> 00:10:53,762
but when I'm done,
you're calling your mother.

286
00:10:53,763 --> 00:10:55,897
Easy for you to say.

287
00:10:55,898 --> 00:10:58,199
You never had to watch
60 Minutes like this.

288
00:11:00,802 --> 00:11:01,969
Hey, Daddy.

289
00:11:01,972 --> 00:11:03,238
Hey, slugger.

290
00:11:03,239 --> 00:11:04,638
How's my girl?

291
00:11:04,641 --> 00:11:06,273
Uh, good. Is Mom around?

292
00:11:06,276 --> 00:11:08,376
Ah, she took your brother out
to celebrate.

293
00:11:08,377 --> 00:11:11,246
He just got his tenth
one-month sober chip.

294
00:11:12,448 --> 00:11:16,217
Yeah, she's gonna make him
a little necklace.

295
00:11:16,219 --> 00:11:17,685
Okay, I'll talk to her later.

296
00:11:17,688 --> 00:11:19,521
Uh, Dad, there's something
I need to tell you.

297
00:11:20,156 --> 00:11:22,656
Leonard and I got married.

298
00:11:22,658 --> 00:11:23,825
You did?

299
00:11:23,826 --> 00:11:25,160
When?

300
00:11:25,161 --> 00:11:26,828
Last week. I'm sorry,
I should've told you.

301
00:11:26,829 --> 00:11:28,195
It was a spur
of the moment thing.

302
00:11:28,198 --> 00:11:29,430
I feel terrible.

303
00:11:29,432 --> 00:11:30,799
Please don't be
too disappointed.

304
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:33,001
Are you happy?

305
00:11:33,002 --> 00:11:34,002
Very.

306
00:11:34,003 --> 00:11:35,302
Leonard is so great.

307
00:11:35,305 --> 00:11:37,137
Well, then I'm happy for you.

308
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:39,339
Aw, thank you, Daddy.

309
00:11:39,342 --> 00:11:40,407
That means so much.

310
00:11:40,410 --> 00:11:41,709
Well, I understand it's hard

311
00:11:41,711 --> 00:11:42,944
to tell someone something

312
00:11:42,945 --> 00:11:44,878
if you think
it's gonna upset 'em.

313
00:11:44,881 --> 00:11:46,113
It is.

314
00:11:46,115 --> 00:11:47,515
You're the best dad ever.

315
00:11:47,517 --> 00:11:51,018
Yeah. Uh, hold that thought.

316
00:11:51,021 --> 00:11:53,353
I've been sitting
on a little news myself.

317
00:11:53,355 --> 00:11:54,988
Well, what is it?

318
00:11:54,990 --> 00:11:58,159
You know that rototiller
I got for the tractor?

319
00:11:58,161 --> 00:11:59,227
No.

320
00:11:59,228 --> 00:12:00,261
Oh, you should see it.

321
00:12:00,262 --> 00:12:02,930
It is a beautiful
piece of machinery.

322
00:12:02,932 --> 00:12:05,666
Anyway, uh...

323
00:12:05,669 --> 00:12:08,636
I backed over
your pet pig with it.

324
00:12:08,637 --> 00:12:11,138
Moondance?

325
00:12:11,141 --> 00:12:14,374
Yeah, he's, uh,
not dancing anymore.

326
00:12:14,377 --> 00:12:16,344
You killed my pig?

327
00:12:17,378 --> 00:12:18,579
I did not kill him.

328
00:12:18,581 --> 00:12:20,915
The vet took care of that.

329
00:12:20,916 --> 00:12:22,650
When?

330
00:12:22,651 --> 00:12:25,719
Oh... ten, 12 months ago.

331
00:12:27,055 --> 00:12:28,422
You didn't tell me for a year?

332
00:12:28,425 --> 00:12:30,892
Well, apple doesn't fall far
from the tree, does it?

333
00:12:31,926 --> 00:12:33,094
Love ya, slugger.

334
00:12:33,095 --> 00:12:34,762
Gotta go!

335
00:12:37,199 --> 00:12:39,400
Okay, Amy, your turn.

336
00:12:48,944 --> 00:12:51,112
What are you doing?

337
00:12:51,113 --> 00:12:53,080
It's called Lamaze breathing.

338
00:12:53,083 --> 00:12:55,717
It helps you push.

339
00:12:56,551 --> 00:12:57,819
Great.

340
00:12:57,820 --> 00:12:59,219
He's pushing
with his uterus.

341
00:13:01,489 --> 00:13:04,358
There's got to be a smarter way
of removing it.

342
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:06,127
Yeah, this is nothing more
than a physics problem.

343
00:13:06,128 --> 00:13:07,395
Right.

344
00:13:07,397 --> 00:13:09,164
Archimedes once said,

345
00:13:09,166 --> 00:13:10,430
"Give me a 'leever' long enough

346
00:13:10,432 --> 00:13:11,932
"and a fulcrum
on which to place it,

347
00:13:11,935 --> 00:13:13,267
and I shall move the world."

348
00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:14,969
Of course.

349
00:13:14,970 --> 00:13:16,671
All we need is to find stuff

350
00:13:16,672 --> 00:13:19,174
to make a "leever" big
enough to fix this.

351
00:13:19,175 --> 00:13:20,407
Exactly.

352
00:13:20,410 --> 00:13:21,575
I'll bet there's
something around here

353
00:13:21,578 --> 00:13:23,177
that could
be a "lehver."

354
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:25,613
Let's see, a "lehver,"
a "lehver"...

355
00:13:25,614 --> 00:13:27,015
Everybody hold on!

356
00:13:27,017 --> 00:13:28,749
Let's take this problem
one step at a time.

357
00:13:28,752 --> 00:13:30,417
First, we need to decide

358
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:32,719
whether we're calling it
leever or lehver.

359
00:13:34,690 --> 00:13:36,623
And the sooner
we decide it's leever,

360
00:13:36,626 --> 00:13:39,493
the sooner we can roll up
our sleeves— not slehves—

361
00:13:39,496 --> 00:13:41,161
and get to work.

362
00:13:41,163 --> 00:13:43,064
We're gonna be here
"foreever."

363
00:13:46,734 --> 00:13:48,169
Thanks a lot, guys.

364
00:13:48,171 --> 00:13:49,237
What did we do?

365
00:13:49,238 --> 00:13:50,504
Before I made that call,

366
00:13:50,507 --> 00:13:51,805
my pig was alive and happy

367
00:13:51,807 --> 00:13:53,141
and rolling around in the mud.

368
00:13:53,142 --> 00:13:55,509
Now he's illegally buried
in our backyard

369
00:13:55,512 --> 00:13:57,811
next to my great-grandmother.

370
00:13:57,814 --> 00:14:00,047
Really?

371
00:14:00,050 --> 00:14:02,950
They didn't eat him?

372
00:14:02,953 --> 00:14:04,819
No.

373
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:07,488
He was a beloved member
of the family.

374
00:14:07,489 --> 00:14:10,557
The breakfast meat family?

375
00:14:12,328 --> 00:14:13,761
It's not funny.

376
00:14:13,762 --> 00:14:15,229
You're up.
Call your mother.

377
00:14:15,232 --> 00:14:16,730
Oh, maybe later.

378
00:14:16,733 --> 00:14:19,467
Your pig dying
made me sad.

379
00:14:19,469 --> 00:14:21,469
And a little hungry.

380
00:14:21,470 --> 00:14:22,970
Phone, now.

381
00:14:22,973 --> 00:14:24,671
Okay. Okay.

382
00:14:24,674 --> 00:14:26,306
Fine.

383
00:14:29,078 --> 00:14:30,445
Hi, Mom.

384
00:14:30,446 --> 00:14:31,778
Try dialing.

385
00:14:33,482 --> 00:14:35,315
You saw that, huh?

386
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:41,589
Hi, Mom. How are you doing?

387
00:14:42,825 --> 00:14:44,057
Oh, good.

388
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:45,693
How's work?

389
00:14:45,695 --> 00:14:46,661
That's nice.

390
00:14:46,662 --> 00:14:48,061
I'm fine.

391
00:14:48,064 --> 00:14:50,198
Hey, listen,
I've been meaning to ask,

392
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:53,600
how come Aunt Doe and
Aunt Florence never got along?

393
00:14:53,603 --> 00:14:54,969
Okay, just...
give me that.

394
00:14:54,970 --> 00:14:56,470
Amy broke up with Sheldon,

395
00:14:56,473 --> 00:14:57,537
she got her ears pierced

396
00:14:57,540 --> 00:15:00,108
and she made us
eat penis cookies!

397
00:15:03,177 --> 00:15:04,411
Hang on.

398
00:15:04,414 --> 00:15:06,446
She wants to talk to you.

399
00:15:10,685 --> 00:15:12,586
I don't think
the lever's working.

400
00:15:12,589 --> 00:15:14,155
What makes you say that?

401
00:15:19,127 --> 00:15:21,863
There's gotta be
something else we could try.

402
00:15:21,864 --> 00:15:23,797
If this was Star Trek,

403
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:25,967
we could use a phaser
to blast it off.

404
00:15:25,969 --> 00:15:27,834
No, it's too
broad of a beam.

405
00:15:27,836 --> 00:15:29,436
You'd need something
more precise,

406
00:15:29,439 --> 00:15:31,439
like Superman's heat vision.

407
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:32,773
Ooh, the Green
Lantern's ring

408
00:15:32,776 --> 00:15:34,876
could make a big green
hand that unscrews it.

409
00:15:34,877 --> 00:15:36,411
If you need
a green hand,

410
00:15:36,412 --> 00:15:37,679
why not just
use the Hulk?

411
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:39,247
Oh, please, the Hulk
would never get

412
00:15:39,248 --> 00:15:41,449
across the border
with that temper.

413
00:15:41,450 --> 00:15:43,050
Guys, excuse me,

414
00:15:43,052 --> 00:15:45,018
not that calling
one of the Avengers

415
00:15:45,021 --> 00:15:47,254
isn't a perfectly
reasonable choice,

416
00:15:47,257 --> 00:15:48,388
but we're
scientists.

417
00:15:48,391 --> 00:15:50,057
Don't you think we
can figure this out

418
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:51,425
using actual science?

419
00:15:51,427 --> 00:15:53,460
Yes, we could
use science.

420
00:15:53,463 --> 00:15:54,728
But it's your
bachelor party.

421
00:15:54,730 --> 00:15:56,129
Lighten up.

00:16:40,175 --> 00:16:41,642
Sometimes it's a curse.

434
00:16:46,647 --> 00:16:48,682
I had no idea

435
00:16:48,685 --> 00:16:50,384
tortilla chips were
such a good fuel source.

436
00:16:50,387 --> 00:16:54,287
They're basically pure
hydrocarbons soaked in fat.

437
00:16:54,290 --> 00:16:56,257
Let's hope the lug nut expands.

438
00:16:56,258 --> 00:16:58,493
What if that burning
food attracts animals?

439
00:16:58,494 --> 00:17:00,627
We have plenty of food
for the animals.

440
00:17:00,629 --> 00:17:01,996
- We do?
- Yep.

441
00:17:01,998 --> 00:17:04,699
A six-foot wiener
in a Flash T-shirt.

442
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:07,134
That's not very nice.

443
00:17:07,136 --> 00:17:09,003
It's a bachelor party.
Lighten up.

444
00:17:14,043 --> 00:17:17,045
What is that awful smell?

445
00:17:17,046 --> 00:17:18,278
It's burning salsa.

446
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:20,014
I'm hoping the acidity
and salinity

447
00:17:20,016 --> 00:17:22,083
combined with electricity
will corrode the lug nut off.

448
00:17:22,084 --> 00:17:24,619
What an innovative solution.

449
00:17:24,621 --> 00:17:28,055
Perhaps I don't give your
MIT education enough credit.

450
00:17:28,057 --> 00:17:30,525
Yeah, I saw it on Mythbusters.

451
00:17:35,764 --> 00:17:38,498
All right, this rust,

452
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:41,302
combined with the aluminum
recovered from the van,

453
00:17:41,304 --> 00:17:42,903
is now thermite.

454
00:17:42,905 --> 00:17:43,904
Great.

455
00:17:43,907 --> 00:17:46,039
Couple pinches
ought to do the trick.

456
00:17:46,042 --> 00:17:48,008
Is that enough
to melt the lug nut?

457
00:17:48,010 --> 00:17:48,976
Well, let's start small.

458
00:17:48,978 --> 00:17:50,010
We can always add more.

459
00:17:50,013 --> 00:17:52,947
You put up a good fight,
lug nut,

460
00:17:52,949 --> 00:17:56,651
but you've met your match.

461
00:18:14,036 --> 00:18:15,268
Hey, look!

462
00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:17,971
The lug nut's off.

463
00:18:35,154 --> 00:18:36,622
What...

464
00:18:36,623 --> 00:18:38,757
What are you
doing back?

465
00:18:40,893 --> 00:18:42,294
We got a flat

466
00:18:42,296 --> 00:18:43,594
and couldn't get
the tire off.

467
00:18:43,596 --> 00:18:45,430
Oh, I'm sorry.

468
00:18:45,431 --> 00:18:46,765
Thank you.

469
00:18:46,767 --> 00:18:48,232
If it makes you feel any better,

470
00:18:48,235 --> 00:18:49,535
I pierced Amy's ears

471
00:18:49,536 --> 00:18:52,304
and her mom made her sit
in my closet.

472
00:18:56,609 --> 00:18:58,142
We blew up Feynman's van.

473
00:18:58,144 --> 00:19:00,711
My dad killed my pig
with his tractor.

474
00:19:00,713 --> 00:19:03,148
I spent the night
in Mexico with Sheldon.

475
00:19:03,150 --> 00:19:04,482
You win.

476
