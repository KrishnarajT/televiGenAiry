1
00:00:01,432 --> 00:00:03,846
So Sheldon, there's something I've
be4enn wanting to talk about

2
00:00:03,847 --> 00:00:05,747
but I know it's
kind of a touchy subject.

3
00:00:05,749 --> 00:00:07,950
Way to narrow it down
to everything.

4
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:10,953
What is it?

5
00:00:10,955 --> 00:00:12,287
Well, your birthday's coming up.

6
00:00:12,289 --> 00:00:13,488
And you've never
let us celebrate it.

7
00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:15,424
And I was hoping maybe
this year we could.

8
00:00:15,426 --> 00:00:18,727
Oh, I suppose that's
a discussion we could have.

9
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,567
Okay, great, I mean,

10
00:00:25,569 --> 00:00:28,170
it doesn't have to be
a big party or anything.

11
00:00:28,172 --> 00:00:30,372
I was just...

12
00:00:32,576 --> 00:00:34,309
Where'd he go?

13
00:00:34,311 --> 00:00:35,477
W-Wait a minute.

14
00:00:35,479 --> 00:00:37,879
You mention his birthday
and he vanishes?

15
00:00:37,881 --> 00:00:41,183
Well, where's that information
been this whole time?

@elder_man

26
00:01:13,449 --> 00:01:15,082
Well, where is he?

27
00:01:15,084 --> 00:01:16,216
Sheldon?

28
00:01:16,218 --> 00:01:17,251
I'll check his room.

29
00:01:17,253 --> 00:01:18,585
Surprise!

30
00:01:18,587 --> 00:01:19,720
Oh, my God!

31
00:01:19,722 --> 00:01:21,689
Just one example

32
00:01:21,691 --> 00:01:24,291
of how birthdays
can be terrible.

33
00:01:24,293 --> 00:01:26,560
Now, can we please

34
00:01:26,562 --> 00:01:27,928
drop this subject
and pick a new one?

35
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:30,464
Yeah, I suggest
"how thick can a soup get

36
00:01:30,466 --> 00:01:31,966
before it becomes a stew?"

37
00:01:31,968 --> 00:01:34,401
You know, the answer,
it may surprise you.

38
00:01:34,403 --> 00:01:37,271
I'm sorry I brought it up.

39
00:01:37,273 --> 00:01:38,505
Yeah, what is the problem?

40
00:01:38,507 --> 00:01:39,540
Is it about getting older?

41
00:01:39,542 --> 00:01:41,976
Please, look at this
porcelain skin.

42
00:01:41,978 --> 00:01:44,778
I'm like a human sink.

43
00:01:46,082 --> 00:01:49,984
But it's the one day a year
that's just all about you.

44
00:01:49,986 --> 00:01:51,952
One day.

45
00:01:55,291 --> 00:01:56,557
Right.

46
00:01:58,494 --> 00:02:00,461
Can you please just tell me why?

47
00:02:00,463 --> 00:02:03,530
Fine.

48
00:02:03,532 --> 00:02:05,699
As you know,
I have a twin sister

49
00:02:05,701 --> 00:02:08,202
with whom I obviously
share a birthday.

50
00:02:08,204 --> 00:02:10,237
Every year we'd
have a party.

51
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:11,805
No one I invited
would ever come,

52
00:02:11,807 --> 00:02:13,240
because they didn't like me.

53
00:02:14,377 --> 00:02:15,976
I'm sorry.

54
00:02:15,978 --> 00:02:17,211
Oh, that part wasn't so bad.

55
00:02:17,213 --> 00:02:18,412
I didn't like them, either.

56
00:02:18,414 --> 00:02:20,080
But then I'd inevitably spend

57
00:02:20,082 --> 00:02:23,650
the whole day being tortured
by my sister's friends.

58
00:02:23,652 --> 00:02:25,552
Oh, you poor thing.

59
00:02:25,554 --> 00:02:27,888
When I was six, they told me
Batman was coming to my party.

60
00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:29,757
I waited by the
door for hours.

61
00:02:29,759 --> 00:02:31,792
Closest thing
to Batman I saw

62
00:02:31,794 --> 00:02:34,028
was when a robin
flew into the window.

63
00:02:35,798 --> 00:02:38,465
You realize none of those things
would happen now?

64
00:02:38,467 --> 00:02:40,367
I do, but why do you care

65
00:02:40,369 --> 00:02:42,503
if I celebrate
my birthday at all?

66
00:02:42,505 --> 00:02:45,706
Well, you made
my last birthday so memorable,

67
00:02:45,708 --> 00:02:47,674
I wanted to return the favor.

68
00:02:47,676 --> 00:02:48,842
Yeah, if you had

69
00:02:48,844 --> 00:02:50,310
a party now, you
have plenty of friends

70
00:02:50,312 --> 00:02:51,512
that would love to come.

71
00:02:51,514 --> 00:02:53,113
And we live here,
so we have no choice.

72
00:02:53,115 --> 00:02:55,149
Yeah.

73
00:02:56,385 --> 00:02:57,651
Very well.

74
00:02:57,653 --> 00:02:59,620
You may celebrate my life
by throwing a party

75
00:02:59,622 --> 00:03:02,689
with cake, presents and a
shower of admiration and love.

76
00:03:02,691 --> 00:03:04,892
But then you owe me big-time.

77
00:03:07,396 --> 00:03:09,496
You have any idea
what you're getting

78
00:03:09,498 --> 00:03:10,898
Sheldon for his birthday?

79
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:13,067
He's been fascinated
with dinosaurs lately.

80
00:03:13,069 --> 00:03:14,435
Maybe we could get him a fossil.

81
00:03:14,437 --> 00:03:16,437
Well, just don't
get anything Jurassic.

82
00:03:16,439 --> 00:03:19,907
He feels like that whole chunk
of time has gone Hollywood.

83
00:03:21,544 --> 00:03:23,844
Hey, uh, you know,

84
00:03:23,846 --> 00:03:26,513
he told a sad story
about how his sister

85
00:03:26,515 --> 00:03:29,817
tricked him into thinking Batman
was coming to his party.

86
00:03:29,819 --> 00:03:31,151
That's funny.

87
00:03:31,153 --> 00:03:32,920
Let's do that.

88
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:36,423
Maybe we could get Batman
to actually show up.

89
00:03:36,425 --> 00:03:39,026
You mean, some guy
in a lame suit?

90
00:03:39,028 --> 00:03:41,295
Or a real Batman.
Hey, Stuart?

91
00:03:41,297 --> 00:03:43,864
Didn't you try to get Adam West
to do a signing here once?

92
00:03:43,866 --> 00:03:46,366
Yeah, but there was kind of
a scheduling conflict.

93
00:03:46,368 --> 00:03:49,303
He, uh, wanted to know
when he'd get paid.

94
00:03:49,305 --> 00:03:51,238
And I wouldn't tell him.

95
00:03:52,708 --> 00:03:54,641
Can I get his contact info?

96
00:03:54,643 --> 00:03:57,044
Sure, uh, but
just so you know,

97
00:03:57,046 --> 00:03:58,378
he's kind of a diva.

98
00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:00,247
He is?
Oh, yeah.

99
00:04:00,249 --> 00:04:01,348
Won't take the bus.

100
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:02,649
He won't pack his own lunch.

101
00:04:02,651 --> 00:04:06,120
Won't let you spend
the night on his couch.

102
00:04:08,257 --> 00:04:11,325
Okay, so how do you feel
about party balloons?

103
00:04:11,327 --> 00:04:12,960
Uh, Mylar balloons, yes.

104
00:04:12,962 --> 00:04:14,561
Latex balloons, no.

105
00:04:14,563 --> 00:04:16,697
Water balloons,
I will jump off the roof

106
00:04:16,699 --> 00:04:18,899
and aim for your car.

107
00:04:19,902 --> 00:04:22,002
All right, what about music?

108
00:04:22,004 --> 00:04:23,403
I enjoy marching bands

109
00:04:23,405 --> 00:04:26,140
and Tibetan throat singing.

110
00:04:26,142 --> 00:04:27,574
No music it is.

111
00:04:28,844 --> 00:04:30,177
What kind of cake
do you like?

112
00:04:30,179 --> 00:04:33,113
Well, my favorite is chocolate
with strawberry frosting,

113
00:04:33,115 --> 00:04:34,982
three layers,
and if there's

114
00:04:34,984 --> 00:04:36,750
writing on it,
make sure it's not all caps.

115
00:04:36,752 --> 00:04:40,254
I don't need my dessert
yelling at me.

116
00:04:42,258 --> 00:04:45,325
Hey, so what was
Adam West like on the phone?

117
00:04:45,327 --> 00:04:46,627
Uh, nice guy.

118
00:04:46,629 --> 00:04:48,328
But it was a little weird
to hear Batman say,

119
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:52,266
"Don't ring the doorbell
or my poodles will go crazy."

120
00:04:52,268 --> 00:04:55,269
You know, Adam West
is my favorite Batman?

121
00:04:55,271 --> 00:04:56,570
Well,

122
00:04:56,572 --> 00:04:58,906
after Michael Keaton,
Christian Bale

123
00:04:58,908 --> 00:05:01,141
and Batman from
The Lego Movie.

124
00:05:02,411 --> 00:05:03,710
Don't say that to him.

125
00:05:03,712 --> 00:05:06,079
What?
He beat out George Clooney.

126
00:05:06,081 --> 00:05:07,080
And that's something.

127
00:05:07,082 --> 00:05:09,449
Like, I love me
some Clooney.

128
00:05:09,451 --> 00:05:11,852
Don't say that to anyone.

129
00:05:14,089 --> 00:05:16,456
Thank you so much
for helping us, Stuart.

130
00:05:16,458 --> 00:05:18,158
Oh, I-I was just

131
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,826
glad to be invited.

132
00:05:19,828 --> 00:05:22,863
To be honest, I don't always
feel like I'm part of the group.

133
00:05:22,865 --> 00:05:24,031
Okay, sweetie,
we're on the clock here.

134
00:05:24,033 --> 00:05:26,533
Can you hate yourself
and frost at the same time?

135
00:05:27,836 --> 00:05:30,370
Hello, I hope I'm not too early.

136
00:05:30,372 --> 00:05:31,305
No, no, no. Come on in.

137
00:05:31,307 --> 00:05:33,874
And how is the radiant
mommy-to-be?

138
00:05:33,876 --> 00:05:35,342
Doing great.

139
00:05:35,344 --> 00:05:37,377
Y-You're pregnant?

140
00:05:37,379 --> 00:05:38,345
Yeah.

141
00:05:38,347 --> 00:05:40,347
Sounds like something

142
00:05:40,349 --> 00:05:43,317
a member of the group
might know.

143
00:05:43,319 --> 00:05:44,585
Yeah, birthday party first.

144
00:05:44,587 --> 00:05:46,653
Pity party later.

145
00:05:49,225 --> 00:05:50,457
Are you crazy?

146
00:05:50,459 --> 00:05:52,159
How can you put Michael Keaton

147
00:05:52,161 --> 00:05:54,494
in front of Christian Bale?

148
00:05:54,496 --> 00:05:56,663
Oh, please.

149
00:05:58,634 --> 00:06:02,135
Even my poodles know
Bale's overrated.

150
00:06:02,137 --> 00:06:04,204
Thank you!

151
00:06:04,206 --> 00:06:06,106
That's why I say
Keaton's number one.

152
00:06:06,108 --> 00:06:07,774
He brought a sense
of humor to the role.

153
00:06:07,776 --> 00:06:09,876
Oh, if you're gonna
factor in a sense of humor,

154
00:06:09,878 --> 00:06:13,046
then I should be
at the top of the list.

155
00:06:13,048 --> 00:06:15,882
It should be me,

156
00:06:15,884 --> 00:06:17,017
Keaton, Kilmer,

157
00:06:17,019 --> 00:06:18,652
Lego, Bale,

158
00:06:18,654 --> 00:06:20,854
and that pretty boy Clooney.

159
00:06:22,424 --> 00:06:24,591
Really?

160
00:06:24,593 --> 00:06:26,159
You're ahead of Bale?

161
00:06:26,161 --> 00:06:28,128
The man who personified
the words,

162
00:06:28,130 --> 00:06:31,164
"I'm Batman."

163
00:06:31,166 --> 00:06:32,766
I never had to say I'm Batman.

164
00:06:32,768 --> 00:06:33,967
I showed up.

165
00:06:33,969 --> 00:06:36,436
People knew I was Batman.

166
00:06:37,706 --> 00:06:40,107
Everywhere I went...
on the TV show,

167
00:06:40,109 --> 00:06:41,308
mall openings...

168
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:44,478
Julie Newmar's bungalow.

169
00:06:47,149 --> 00:06:49,583
I'm sold... you're ahead of Bale.

170
00:06:50,719 --> 00:06:53,287
There's another reason
I should be higher on the list.

171
00:06:53,289 --> 00:06:54,721
All those other guys

172
00:06:54,723 --> 00:06:57,858
had muscles built
into their costumes.

173
00:06:57,860 --> 00:07:00,127
All I had in my Batsuit

174
00:07:00,129 --> 00:07:04,097
was 100%, grade-A West.

175
00:07:06,869 --> 00:07:09,303
Can we just all agree
we're worried about Affleck?

176
00:07:09,305 --> 00:07:11,438
Sure.
Yeah, of course.

177
00:07:12,775 --> 00:07:14,775
What's an Affleck?

178
00:07:17,713 --> 00:07:20,414
Is there a reason I had
to leave my own apartment?

179
00:07:20,416 --> 00:07:22,082
Well, I think
they just want you to see it

180
00:07:22,084 --> 00:07:23,684
for the first time
all decorated.

181
00:07:23,686 --> 00:07:27,354
But who's gonna tell them
they're doing it wrong?

182
00:07:27,356 --> 00:07:30,590
Well, I'm... I'm sure they'll
ask you to give a speech,

183
00:07:30,592 --> 00:07:33,327
and that's when
you just tear 'em a new one.

184
00:07:33,329 --> 00:07:36,229
Have to say, you...

185
00:07:36,231 --> 00:07:38,165
you do look good in that suit.

186
00:07:38,167 --> 00:07:39,599
Oh. Thank you.

187
00:07:39,601 --> 00:07:41,735
Maybe later I'll, uh...

188
00:07:41,737 --> 00:07:45,472
get to see you
in your birthday suit.

189
00:07:47,743 --> 00:07:50,410
But this is my
birthday suit.

190
00:07:51,847 --> 00:07:54,614
Are you having a stroke?

191
00:07:56,051 --> 00:07:57,250
Because that's the kind of thing

192
00:07:57,252 --> 00:07:58,685
that just ruins
a birthday party.

193
00:08:01,123 --> 00:08:03,657
So, Mother, I'm surprised
you came all this way

194
00:08:03,659 --> 00:08:04,758
for Sheldon's birthday.

195
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:05,892
Oh, I was happy to.

196
00:08:05,894 --> 00:08:07,828
He did come to my 60th.

197
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:11,698
Oh. You had a party
for your 60th?

198
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:14,000
Oh, I wouldn't call it a party.

199
00:08:14,002 --> 00:08:15,969
Just a few close friends.

200
00:08:17,373 --> 00:08:19,339
And your sister and brother.

201
00:08:21,877 --> 00:08:24,111
You know, to be fair,
we did get married in Vegas

202
00:08:24,113 --> 00:08:25,145
and didn't invite her.

203
00:08:25,147 --> 00:08:28,048
And I never did thank you
for that, dear.

204
00:08:30,652 --> 00:08:32,452
Oh.

205
00:08:32,454 --> 00:08:35,455
Penny says everyone's there.
Are you ready?

206
00:08:35,457 --> 00:08:38,058
I am.

207
00:08:45,401 --> 00:08:47,667
Oh. Wait.
Are you all right?

208
00:08:47,669 --> 00:08:50,504
No, I just...
I got a little light-headed.

209
00:08:50,506 --> 00:08:51,938
Oh, d-do you need a minute?

210
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:54,074
No.

211
00:08:54,076 --> 00:08:56,410
No, if I can walk
past that pet shop

212
00:08:56,412 --> 00:08:59,846
with the parrot in the window,
I suppose I can do this.

213
00:09:04,787 --> 00:09:07,254
Happy birthday!

214
00:09:09,057 --> 00:09:10,390
Speech! Speech!

215
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:13,260
Come on, Sheldon,
say something.

216
00:09:13,262 --> 00:09:14,494
Uh, um...

217
00:09:14,496 --> 00:09:16,997
uh, thank you all
so much for coming.

218
00:09:16,999 --> 00:09:18,231
Uh, Beverly.

219
00:09:18,233 --> 00:09:20,233
Wil Wheaton.

220
00:09:20,235 --> 00:09:22,736
Adam West,
for some reason.

221
00:09:24,106 --> 00:09:26,873
Batman finally came
to your party.

222
00:09:26,875 --> 00:09:29,609
Happy birthday, Sherman.

223
00:09:32,781 --> 00:09:34,214
Thank you.

224
00:09:34,216 --> 00:09:36,082
This is all so thoughtful.

225
00:09:44,726 --> 00:09:46,560
Excuse me.

226
00:09:53,902 --> 00:09:55,769
I still get paid, don't I?

227
00:10:05,269 --> 00:10:07,736
Okay, I'd better go in
there and talk to him.

228
00:10:07,738 --> 00:10:09,705
Well, don't you think
I'm the one who should go in?

229
00:10:09,707 --> 00:10:12,508
No offense, but I've known
the guy a really long time.

230
00:10:12,510 --> 00:10:14,376
Well, I've, you know,

231
00:10:14,378 --> 00:10:17,112
seen him without pants on.

232
00:10:17,915 --> 00:10:21,049
Again, no offense,
but so have I.

233
00:10:21,051 --> 00:10:23,318
Well, he's seen me
without pants on.

234
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:24,286
Again, no...

235
00:10:24,288 --> 00:10:26,488
Okay, this is ridiculous.

236
00:10:29,593 --> 00:10:30,492
Sheldon?

237
00:10:30,494 --> 00:10:31,493
Can I come in?

238
00:10:32,863 --> 00:10:35,497
How do you know I'm not using
the facilities?

239
00:10:35,499 --> 00:10:38,267
Because you e-mail me your
bathroom schedule once a week,

240
00:10:38,269 --> 00:10:39,835
even though
I've clicked unsubscribe,

241
00:10:39,837 --> 00:10:41,370
like, a thousand times.

242
00:10:47,611 --> 00:10:49,278
So...

243
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:50,913
what's going on?

244
00:10:50,915 --> 00:10:52,314
I don't know.

245
00:10:52,316 --> 00:10:54,049
I-I looked around the room,

246
00:10:54,051 --> 00:10:56,151
and I saw all the faces
and the presents,

247
00:10:56,153 --> 00:10:58,520
and it... it was just too much.

248
00:10:59,690 --> 00:11:01,056
I get that.

249
00:11:03,294 --> 00:11:05,694
Hey, you want to just bring
a few people in here?

250
00:11:05,696 --> 00:11:07,596
You know,
Wil Wheaton in the bathtub,

251
00:11:07,598 --> 00:11:09,932
Batman on the toilet.

252
00:11:09,934 --> 00:11:12,134
It'll be like
the weirdest Comic-Con ever.

253
00:11:14,972 --> 00:11:17,239
I know that you worked hard
to put this together.

254
00:11:17,241 --> 00:11:18,740
I'm sorry I'm ruining it.

255
00:11:18,742 --> 00:11:20,008
Oh, pl...
You're not ruining it.

256
00:11:20,010 --> 00:11:22,044
Look, at some point,
Raj will try to get everyone

257
00:11:22,046 --> 00:11:23,345
to do the Electric Slide.

258
00:11:23,347 --> 00:11:25,047
Now, that will ruin it.

259
00:11:26,817 --> 00:11:29,218
I don't think
I can go back out there.

260
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:31,787
That's fine.

261
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:45,601
You know, I hate that
your sister and her friends

262
00:11:45,603 --> 00:11:47,903
used to torture you.

263
00:11:47,905 --> 00:11:49,638
But what I hate even more

264
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:53,175
is, if I was there,
I would have tortured you, too.

265
00:11:55,346 --> 00:11:58,313
Based on this pep talk,
I'd say you're still doing it.

266
00:11:58,315 --> 00:12:00,749
My point is,

267
00:12:00,751 --> 00:12:02,718
there was a time I never
would've been friends

268
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,920
with someone like you,
and now...

269
00:12:04,922 --> 00:12:06,655
you are one
of my favorite people.

270
00:12:06,657 --> 00:12:08,991
So, if what you need is

271
00:12:08,993 --> 00:12:11,660
to spend your birthday
in a bathroom,

272
00:12:11,662 --> 00:12:14,796
I'm happy to do it with you.

273
00:12:16,467 --> 00:12:18,700
Well, everyone will
think I'm weird.

274
00:12:25,576 --> 00:12:27,910
Sweetie, you are weird.

275
00:12:29,213 --> 00:12:31,113
Everyone knows you're weird,

276
00:12:31,115 --> 00:12:32,381
but they're all still here

277
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:34,950
because they care
about you so much.

278
00:12:36,153 --> 00:12:37,252
Hello.

279
00:12:37,254 --> 00:12:38,687
Some of us need
to check our hair

280
00:12:38,689 --> 00:12:41,657
because we might have a shot
with Leonard's mother.

281
00:12:44,962 --> 00:12:46,895
Leonard.
Hey.

282
00:12:46,897 --> 00:12:48,163
It's been a while.

283
00:12:48,165 --> 00:12:49,298
Leslie.

284
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:50,933
I can't remember
the last time we talked.

285
00:12:50,935 --> 00:12:52,668
So much has changed.

286
00:12:54,305 --> 00:12:56,638
Has it?

287
00:12:58,108 --> 00:13:00,042
Yeah, uh, um,
Penny and I got married.

288
00:13:00,044 --> 00:13:01,476
Wow, congratulations.

289
00:13:01,478 --> 00:13:02,744
You know, actually,

290
00:13:02,746 --> 00:13:04,513
I thought you'd be living
with Sheldon forever.

291
00:13:04,515 --> 00:13:06,448
Yeah, well...

292
00:13:08,218 --> 00:13:09,484
Don't be a stranger.

293
00:13:10,554 --> 00:13:12,521
Okay, everybody,

294
00:13:12,523 --> 00:13:13,755
Sheldon is gonna come back out,

295
00:13:13,757 --> 00:13:15,090
but I think
he's a little embarrassed,

296
00:13:15,092 --> 00:13:17,726
so let's all be
extra nice, okay?

297
00:13:17,728 --> 00:13:19,161
What are you
looking at me for?

298
00:13:19,163 --> 00:13:20,595
I'm a saint.

299
00:13:20,597 --> 00:13:22,597
But a sinner in the sack.

300
00:13:26,603 --> 00:13:27,903
Hello, everyone.

301
00:13:27,905 --> 00:13:29,004
I-I...

302
00:13:29,006 --> 00:13:30,872
I'd like to apologize
for my behavior.

303
00:13:30,874 --> 00:13:33,608
I hope it hasn't put
a damper on the party.

304
00:13:33,610 --> 00:13:35,577
So, just, please,
enjoy yourselves.

305
00:13:35,579 --> 00:13:36,745
That's good.

306
00:13:40,217 --> 00:13:42,617
Oh, this is quickly
getting out of hand.

307
00:13:42,619 --> 00:13:44,686
If I may,

308
00:13:44,688 --> 00:13:46,989
I-I'd like to propose a toast.

309
00:13:46,991 --> 00:13:49,391
Um, thank you all
for coming tonight.

310
00:13:49,393 --> 00:13:50,459
I know it's customary

311
00:13:50,461 --> 00:13:53,395
for the birthday boy
to receive presents,

312
00:13:53,397 --> 00:13:55,630
but I feel like I got
the greatest gift

313
00:13:55,632 --> 00:13:56,999
the day he was born.

314
00:13:57,001 --> 00:13:58,033
Aw.

315
00:13:58,035 --> 00:14:00,035
- Hear, hear.
- Cheers.

316
00:14:00,037 --> 00:14:02,371
Amy, that was lovely.

317
00:14:02,373 --> 00:14:03,872
You know,

318
00:14:03,874 --> 00:14:04,840
this is fun.

319
00:14:04,842 --> 00:14:06,008
Let's do more.

320
00:14:06,010 --> 00:14:08,310
Someone else say something
wonderful about me.

321
00:14:08,312 --> 00:14:10,612
Sheldon,
I don't think everyone...

322
00:14:10,614 --> 00:14:12,714
Wolowitz, perfect.
Everyone listen to Wolowitz.

323
00:14:14,018 --> 00:14:15,784
Okay, then, uh,

324
00:14:15,786 --> 00:14:17,552
Sheldon,

325
00:14:17,554 --> 00:14:19,187
we've known each other
a long time.

326
00:14:19,189 --> 00:14:22,557
And it is a pleasure
to work with you

327
00:14:22,559 --> 00:14:24,226
and call you my friend.

328
00:14:24,228 --> 00:14:25,961
Little generic. Keep thinking.
We'll circle back.

329
00:14:25,963 --> 00:14:27,462
Wil Wheaton, go.

330
00:14:28,966 --> 00:14:32,300
Sheldon, I know that we've had
our ups and downs,

331
00:14:32,302 --> 00:14:34,369
but I can honestly say

332
00:14:34,371 --> 00:14:35,871
that my life is
so much more interesting

333
00:14:35,873 --> 00:14:37,072
because you are in it.

334
00:14:37,074 --> 00:14:40,575
We may have met because
you are a fan of Star Trek.

335
00:14:40,577 --> 00:14:43,045
But I have become
a fan of Sheldon Cooper.

336
00:14:43,047 --> 00:14:44,813
Live long and prosper,
buddy.

337
00:14:44,815 --> 00:14:45,881
And happy birthday.

338
00:14:45,883 --> 00:14:47,149
Cheers.

339
00:14:47,151 --> 00:14:49,418
That's how you do it, Wolowitz.

340
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:51,453
Now you see

341
00:14:51,455 --> 00:14:52,921
why he's famous and you're not.

342
00:14:55,325 --> 00:14:56,858
Sheldon,

343
00:14:56,860 --> 00:14:59,327
I know the future holds
great things for you,

344
00:14:59,329 --> 00:15:02,030
and we all can't wait to see
what they are.

345
00:15:02,032 --> 00:15:04,266
Happy birthday, dear.

346
00:15:04,268 --> 00:15:06,168
Cheers.

347
00:15:06,170 --> 00:15:07,702
Someone call Animal Control.

348
00:15:07,704 --> 00:15:10,272
There's a cougar on the loose.

349
00:15:11,575 --> 00:15:13,008
Barry, stop.

350
00:15:13,010 --> 00:15:14,643
Seriously, Barry, stop.

351
00:15:16,547 --> 00:15:19,681
And it was Gandhi who said,

352
00:15:19,683 --> 00:15:22,050
"Live as if you were to

353
00:15:22,052 --> 00:15:24,219
"die tomorrow.

354
00:15:24,221 --> 00:15:26,621
"Learn as if you were to live

355
00:15:26,623 --> 00:15:28,023
forever."

356
00:15:28,025 --> 00:15:29,658
And it was Sheldon Cooper who
said "Let's speed this up.

357
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:32,127
A lot of people want to talk"

358
00:15:32,129 --> 00:15:35,030
Uh, in the past, I would've said
something obnoxious,

359
00:15:35,032 --> 00:15:37,299
like, "Happy birthday, dumbass".

360
00:15:37,301 --> 00:15:39,401
But I'm not gonna do it.

361
00:15:39,403 --> 00:15:41,069
You and I have both grown a lot,

362
00:15:41,071 --> 00:15:43,672
and it's just so nice
to see you all again.

363
00:15:43,674 --> 00:15:45,073
So...

364
00:15:45,075 --> 00:15:46,475
happy birthday, Sheldon.

365
00:15:46,477 --> 00:15:47,776
Oh.

366
00:15:47,778 --> 00:15:49,845
Oh, now, you know I hate change.
Say it.

367
00:15:49,847 --> 00:15:51,446
Happy birthday, dumbass!

368
00:15:53,283 --> 00:15:54,950
Happy birthday, young man.

369
00:15:54,952 --> 00:15:58,453
And if any of you have enjoyed
seeing me here today,

370
00:15:58,455 --> 00:16:01,056
I'm also available
for Comic-Cons,

371
00:16:01,058 --> 00:16:04,192
bachelor parties,
bar mitzvahs...

372
00:16:04,194 --> 00:16:07,729
I can't think of anything to say
that hasn't already been said.

373
00:16:07,731 --> 00:16:09,965
So, here's to you, Sheldon.

374
00:16:09,967 --> 00:16:11,299
Hear, hear.
Hear, hear.

375
00:16:11,301 --> 00:16:12,567
Thank you, Bernadette.

376
00:16:12,569 --> 00:16:13,835
That was perfect.

377
00:16:13,837 --> 00:16:17,339
What? You gotta be kidding me?

378
00:16:17,341 --> 00:16:19,774
Sheldon, we've been
together so long,

379
00:16:19,776 --> 00:16:22,410
it's hard to remember a time
you weren't in my life.

380
00:16:22,412 --> 00:16:23,912
And believe me, I try.

381
00:16:25,682 --> 00:16:27,048
You make me laugh.

382
00:16:27,050 --> 00:16:29,251
You make me a better scientist.

383
00:16:29,253 --> 00:16:30,752
You make me crazy.

384
00:16:30,754 --> 00:16:32,354
You're more than just
my roommate,

385
00:16:32,356 --> 00:16:34,089
you're my brother.

386
00:16:34,858 --> 00:16:35,991
Thank you.

387
00:16:35,993 --> 00:16:37,392
Happy birthday, buddy.

388
00:16:37,394 --> 00:16:39,227
Cheers.

389
00:16:40,130 --> 00:16:41,997
Thank you.
That-that was wonderful.

390
00:16:41,999 --> 00:16:43,064
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

391
00:16:43,066 --> 00:16:44,933
Stuart didn't get to speak.

392
00:16:44,935 --> 00:16:47,302
Oh, oh, okay. Um...

393
00:16:47,304 --> 00:16:49,204
Uh, Sheldon,

394
00:16:49,206 --> 00:16:51,239
I've spent most of my life
feeling invisible,

395
00:16:51,241 --> 00:16:53,308
but having you and everyone...

396
00:16:53,310 --> 00:16:55,277
Hey, everybody, listen up.

397
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:59,247
You nailed it.

398
00:16:59,249 --> 00:17:01,183
We've got someone
who couldn't be here

399
00:17:01,185 --> 00:17:02,417
but really wanted to wish you

400
00:17:02,419 --> 00:17:04,119
a happy birthday.

401
00:17:05,255 --> 00:17:06,321
Hello, Sheldon.

402
00:17:07,758 --> 00:17:09,691
Professor Hawking.

403
00:17:09,693 --> 00:17:11,760
Happy birthday to you.

404
00:17:11,762 --> 00:17:12,961
Thank you so much.

405
00:17:12,963 --> 00:17:13,929
I can't believe you're...

406
00:17:13,931 --> 00:17:15,096
Happy birthday to you.

407
00:17:15,098 --> 00:17:17,265
Oh, you're singing.
Well, I'm sorry.

408
00:17:18,902 --> 00:17:20,769
Happy birthday, dear Sheldon.

409
00:17:20,771 --> 00:17:21,903
Uh, Professor Hawking,

410
00:17:21,905 --> 00:17:23,705
if you just give us
one second,

411
00:17:23,707 --> 00:17:26,041
we'll light the candles,
and we can all sing together.

412
00:17:26,043 --> 00:17:29,311
I was crushing it,
but all right.

413
00:17:30,447 --> 00:17:31,980
Okay, while they get
the cake,

414
00:17:31,982 --> 00:17:33,548
Sheldon,
I just want to say,

415
00:17:33,550 --> 00:17:35,317
I hope you didn't think you were
gonna get through tonight

416
00:17:35,319 --> 00:17:36,418
without a hug.

417
00:17:37,688 --> 00:17:39,287
You know, I used to hate
these hugs.

418
00:17:42,626 --> 00:17:44,793
Now they're just
extremely irritating.

419
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:56,006
Ready when you are,
Professor Hawking.

420
00:17:56,008 --> 00:17:58,508
And a one, and a two...
