1
00:00:01,953 --> 00:00:03,953
Did you hear about this study
that found people

2
00:00:03,955 --> 00:00:06,556
that were cool and popular
at 13

3
00:00:06,558 --> 00:00:08,291
have problems succeeding
later in life?

4
00:00:08,293 --> 00:00:10,727
Hmm. I'm doing okay,
and I was very popular at 13.

5
00:00:10,729 --> 00:00:11,861
In school?

6
00:00:11,863 --> 00:00:13,529
Oh, no. At home.

7
00:00:14,299 --> 00:00:15,498
The servants would sing to me,

8
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:17,400
laugh at my jokes...

9
00:00:18,203 --> 00:00:21,704
I wish I knew their names.

10
00:00:21,706 --> 00:00:24,674
Does the study say what happens
to the unpopular kids?

11
00:00:24,676 --> 00:00:27,143
You tell me... you woke up
in bed with one.

12
00:00:28,279 --> 00:00:30,113
Listen to this.

13
00:00:30,115 --> 00:00:32,815
I just received an e-mail
from Wil Wheaton.

14
00:00:32,817 --> 00:00:35,818
Leonard Nimoy's son is
working on a documentary

15
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:38,087
that he started with his
father before he passed away.

16
00:00:38,089 --> 00:00:40,289
It's about Mr. Spock and
his impact on our culture.

17
00:00:40,291 --> 00:00:41,257
Hmm.

18
00:00:41,259 --> 00:00:42,492
Why is he writing to you?

19
00:00:42,494 --> 00:00:44,494
Well, they're looking
for fans to interview,

20
00:00:44,496 --> 00:00:46,262
and Wil thought
I'd be good for it.

21
00:00:46,264 --> 00:00:47,330
Oh. Hey, high five.

22
00:00:47,332 --> 00:00:48,731
Absolutely not.

23
00:00:50,368 --> 00:00:51,334
Yeah, Penny,

24
00:00:51,336 --> 00:00:52,502
you spent some time
in front

25
00:00:52,504 --> 00:00:54,837
of the camera.
Any words of advice?

26
00:00:54,839 --> 00:00:56,139
Yes. Don't take your shirt off

27
00:00:56,141 --> 00:00:58,541
just because the director
said so.

28
00:00:58,543 --> 00:01:00,777
This is a documentary
about Mr. Spock.

29
00:01:00,779 --> 00:01:04,247
I'm sure if there's nudity,
it will be tasteful.

40
00:01:38,437 --> 00:01:40,003
Hey. You got a minute?

41
00:01:40,005 --> 00:01:41,138
Not really.

42
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:44,474
Visigoths are kind of up my butt
right now.

43
00:01:44,476 --> 00:01:46,410
Pause the game, Howard.

44
00:01:46,412 --> 00:01:47,978
"Howard"? Uh-oh.

45
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:50,580
Make room, Visigoths.

46
00:01:51,116 --> 00:01:52,783
'Sup?

47
00:01:52,785 --> 00:01:55,025
We need to talk
about redecorating this place.

48
00:01:55,026 --> 00:01:57,955
Oh, no, not this again.
Look,

49
00:01:57,956 --> 00:02:00,957
I get that you grew up here
and you're attached to things

50
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:02,292
looking
a certain way, but...

51
00:02:02,294 --> 00:02:04,933
I want this to feel
like my house, too.

52
00:02:04,934 --> 00:02:07,565
Oh, honey, of course
it's your house.

53
00:02:07,566 --> 00:02:10,767
Why else would you
be cleaning it all the time?

54
00:02:12,938 --> 00:02:14,838
All right.
Let's start over.

55
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:16,139
I'm redecorating.

56
00:02:16,141 --> 00:02:18,275
The furniture,
the carpeting, the walls.

57
00:02:18,277 --> 00:02:21,111
I'm changing everything that
depresses me when I look at it.

58
00:02:21,113 --> 00:02:23,180
Try not to be one
of those things.

59
00:02:24,049 --> 00:02:25,749
May I say something?

60
00:02:25,751 --> 00:02:27,784
Is it about how I can't have
new wallpaper

61
00:02:27,786 --> 00:02:30,187
'cause your dad left when you
were little and your mom died?

62
00:02:30,189 --> 00:02:31,955
Never mind.

63
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:36,960
Hello, Amy. It's Sheldon.

64
00:02:36,962 --> 00:02:39,262
Yeah, I-I know
that we're broken up, but

65
00:02:39,264 --> 00:02:41,565
I'm leaving this message because
I thought perhaps you'd like

66
00:02:41,567 --> 00:02:45,235
to watch me be interviewed for
a documentary about Mr. Spock.

67
00:02:45,237 --> 00:02:49,005
Or as I like to call it,
a Spockumentary.

68
00:02:49,007 --> 00:02:50,373
Yeah, I'm going to use

69
00:02:50,375 --> 00:02:52,476
that joke in the interview,
so try to laugh

70
00:02:52,478 --> 00:02:54,744
like you're hearing it
for the first time.

71
00:02:54,746 --> 00:02:56,546
You know, hysterically, hmm?

72
00:02:56,548 --> 00:03:00,450
And with a tinge of sadness
that I'm no longer in your life.

73
00:03:00,452 --> 00:03:03,019
I'm the one who thought
of "Spockumentary"

74
00:03:03,021 --> 00:03:05,489
And I'm laughing like I did
the first time I heard it.

75
00:03:09,561 --> 00:03:10,560
Hello.

76
00:03:10,562 --> 00:03:11,628
Hey, Sheldon.

77
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:12,762
This is Adam Nimoy.

78
00:03:12,764 --> 00:03:15,198
Nice to meet you.
Oh, it's nice to meet you.

79
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,567
I admire your father's work
very much.

80
00:03:17,569 --> 00:03:20,370
It's not every day I get to meet
someone whose life's journey

81
00:03:20,372 --> 00:03:22,873
began in my hero's scrotum.

82
00:03:25,144 --> 00:03:28,078
I told you.
This guy is gold.

83
00:03:32,518 --> 00:03:33,917
Whatcha doing?
Oh!

84
00:03:33,919 --> 00:03:36,553
Making myself a bologna sandwich
like my mom used to make me

85
00:03:36,555 --> 00:03:39,156
after my dad left,
but before she died.

86
00:03:43,695 --> 00:03:44,794
Okay, listen, I'm thinking

87
00:03:44,796 --> 00:03:47,197
that maybe we can compromise
on the house.

88
00:03:47,199 --> 00:03:49,733
I'm listening.

89
00:03:49,735 --> 00:03:52,702
Let's just redo one room
and see how it goes.

90
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:54,070
That is reasonable.

91
00:03:54,072 --> 00:03:55,972
But what room?

92
00:03:55,974 --> 00:03:57,574
How 'bout this one?

93
00:03:57,576 --> 00:04:02,279
No way. No, this is the room I
associate the most with my mom.

94
00:04:02,281 --> 00:04:04,214
Then how 'bout the bathroom?

95
00:04:04,216 --> 00:04:07,083
I want to change my answer.

96
00:04:07,085 --> 00:04:09,786
Fine. Then the dining room.

97
00:04:09,788 --> 00:04:12,422
I guess we didn't use it
very often.

98
00:04:12,424 --> 00:04:13,790
Unless we had company.

99
00:04:13,792 --> 00:04:16,326
Which didn't happen much
after my dad left and not at all

100
00:04:16,328 --> 00:04:17,040
after my mom...

101
00:04:17,064 --> 00:04:18,744
Great! I'm gonna go
pick out paint samples.

102
00:04:21,466 --> 00:04:23,600
All right, we're just gonna
have a conversation.

103
00:04:23,602 --> 00:04:25,936
Pretend the
camera's not here.

104
00:04:25,938 --> 00:04:28,071
All right.
But this better not be

105
00:04:28,073 --> 00:04:30,674
some elaborate scheme
to get me out of my shirt.

106
00:04:32,744 --> 00:04:34,110
How long have
you known Adam?

107
00:04:34,112 --> 00:04:35,545
A few years.
Mm-hmm.

108
00:04:35,547 --> 00:04:38,682
And what are you
getting him back for?

109
00:04:39,585 --> 00:04:41,318
Let's start with your
name and occupation.

110
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:45,355
Dr. Sheldon Cooper,
theoretical physicist, Caltech.

111
00:04:45,357 --> 00:04:49,226
And what is your earliest memory
of the character Spock?

112
00:04:49,228 --> 00:04:53,863
The first episode of Star Trek:
The Original Series I ever saw

113
00:04:53,865 --> 00:04:55,865
was "The Galileo Seven."

114
00:04:55,867 --> 00:04:59,302
Uh, Spock had just landed
on the planet Taurus II.

115
00:04:59,304 --> 00:05:01,838
Then my brother came in,
sat on my head,

116
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:04,541
and said, "Eat farts."

117
00:05:05,811 --> 00:05:07,310
After that day, I was hooked.

118
00:05:07,312 --> 00:05:09,012
On Star Trek,

119
00:05:09,014 --> 00:05:12,048
not my brother's
sphincter-based cuisine.

120
00:05:13,585 --> 00:05:16,486
What was it about Spock
that appealed to you?

121
00:05:16,488 --> 00:05:19,556
I think the same thing that
appeals to people everywhere,

122
00:05:19,558 --> 00:05:22,525
the dream
of a cold, rational world

123
00:05:22,527 --> 00:05:24,661
entirely without human emotion.

124
00:05:24,663 --> 00:05:26,630
Spock came

125
00:05:26,632 --> 00:05:28,665
from a planet governed
only by logic.

126
00:05:28,667 --> 00:05:30,934
You know, on Vulcan,
when your brother asks,

127
00:05:30,936 --> 00:05:33,470
"Why are you hitting yourself?"
the answer is,

128
00:05:33,472 --> 00:05:34,838
"I'm not.

129
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:36,673
You're moving my arm."

130
00:05:38,277 --> 00:05:39,209
To which he says,

131
00:05:39,211 --> 00:05:40,577
"Fascinating."

132
00:05:40,579 --> 00:05:44,414
And then you both watch
educational television.

133
00:05:44,416 --> 00:05:46,216
Aw. When he says
things like that,

134
00:05:46,218 --> 00:05:48,385
I just want to hug him
and make everything better.

135
00:05:48,387 --> 00:05:50,420
My brother was
mean to me, too.

136
00:05:50,422 --> 00:05:52,088
Yeah, you probably
had it coming.

137
00:05:54,293 --> 00:05:56,159
Do you have
any Spock collectibles?

138
00:05:56,161 --> 00:05:57,227
I have many.

139
00:05:57,229 --> 00:05:59,663
My most treasured
is an autographed napkin

140
00:05:59,665 --> 00:06:02,399
given to me by my
very thoughtful friend Penny.

141
00:06:02,401 --> 00:06:03,733
That's her over there.

142
00:06:05,971 --> 00:06:08,171
Hi!

143
00:06:08,874 --> 00:06:10,206
Look at that.

144
00:06:10,208 --> 00:06:13,843
I'm in a movie,
my shirt stayed on.

145
00:06:13,845 --> 00:06:15,578
Can we see the napkin?

146
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:17,047
Of course. Excuse me.

147
00:06:17,049 --> 00:06:18,548
This will just take a moment.

148
00:06:30,095 --> 00:06:32,962
When did we get
a wall safe?

149
00:06:32,964 --> 00:06:37,300
When there was no more room
in the floor safe.

150
00:06:37,302 --> 00:06:40,103
When did we get
a floor safe?

151
00:06:40,105 --> 00:06:43,073
When we got the security camera.

152
00:06:43,075 --> 00:06:45,308
There's a
security camera?

153
00:06:46,278 --> 00:06:49,245
Aquaman, protecting your home
since 2012.

154
00:06:51,216 --> 00:06:54,250
Oh, my God.
We've done things on that couch.

155
00:06:54,252 --> 00:06:56,086
Yeah. You don't have to tell me.

156
00:06:58,724 --> 00:07:01,024
So, your father-in-law
is in there right now?

157
00:07:01,026 --> 00:07:02,258
Yes. So back me up.

158
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:04,561
The house is good the way it is.
Oh, okay. Got it.

159
00:07:05,997 --> 00:07:07,330
Hey. What's going on?

160
00:07:07,332 --> 00:07:08,798
Hey.
Hey, Raj.

161
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,334
Dad and I were just talking
about taking down this wall.

162
00:07:11,336 --> 00:07:16,106
You sure? It's a...
pretty great wall.

163
00:07:16,108 --> 00:07:17,841
What's so great about it?

164
00:07:18,877 --> 00:07:20,910
I'm sorry.
I did what I could.

165
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:25,115
Seriously? You brought Raj over
to take your side?

166
00:07:25,117 --> 00:07:26,783
Your dad's on your side.

167
00:07:26,785 --> 00:07:29,252
He's not on my side. He's doing
all the work for free.

168
00:07:29,254 --> 00:07:32,155
That is so
generous of you.

169
00:07:32,157 --> 00:07:36,159
I'd like to switch sides.

170
00:07:36,161 --> 00:07:37,427
Look, uh...

171
00:07:37,429 --> 00:07:39,028
I don't even think
you can take this wall down

172
00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:40,230
'cause it's load-bearing.

173
00:07:40,232 --> 00:07:41,498
Well, it's easy to find out.

174
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:43,700
Just go into the crawlspace
under the house and check.

175
00:07:43,702 --> 00:07:46,436
When is your visa up?

176
00:07:49,207 --> 00:07:51,908
Not only is it signed to me

177
00:07:51,910 --> 00:07:53,743
but this is where he wiped
his mouth.

178
00:07:53,745 --> 00:07:58,214
So we are currently in the
presence of Leonard Nimoy's DNA.

179
00:07:58,216 --> 00:08:01,684
Um, doesn't Adam count
as Leonard Nimoy's DNA?

180
00:08:01,686 --> 00:08:05,622
No offense, but this is
pure 100% Nimoy.

181
00:08:05,624 --> 00:08:08,425
Because of your mother,
you're only 50%.

182
00:08:08,427 --> 00:08:10,994
Which isn't bad,

183
00:08:10,996 --> 00:08:14,831
but anything that you wipe
your mouth on gets thrown away.

184
00:08:15,967 --> 00:08:17,167
Okay, enough
about the napkin.

185
00:08:17,169 --> 00:08:18,201
What else you
hiding in there?

186
00:08:18,203 --> 00:08:19,469
Wouldn't you like
to know?

187
00:08:19,471 --> 00:08:21,137
I would.
All right then.

188
00:08:22,007 --> 00:08:23,072
See? Just my valuables.

189
00:08:23,074 --> 00:08:26,843
My passport, uh, my will...
You have a will?

190
00:08:26,845 --> 00:08:29,479
Yeah... my 1/18 scale
Wil Wheaton action figure.

191
00:08:31,049 --> 00:08:32,715
I also have the other kind
of will,

192
00:08:32,717 --> 00:08:36,920
and in it I will my Wil
back to Wil.

193
00:08:36,922 --> 00:08:37,887
Will Wil want it?

194
00:08:37,889 --> 00:08:39,322
Wil won't.

195
00:08:39,991 --> 00:08:41,691
What's that ring box?

196
00:08:41,693 --> 00:08:42,759
Oh. That is

197
00:08:42,761 --> 00:08:44,060
an engagement ring

198
00:08:44,062 --> 00:08:46,262
that I was going to give
my girlfriend Amy.

199
00:08:46,264 --> 00:08:48,064
What?

200
00:08:49,568 --> 00:08:51,201
You bought her a ring?

201
00:08:51,203 --> 00:08:52,235
No, no, no. This has been
in my family

202
00:08:52,237 --> 00:08:55,238
for generations.
Except for a short time

203
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:57,707
when Comanches cut off my
great-great-great-grandmother's

204
00:08:57,709 --> 00:08:59,876
finger and stole it.

205
00:09:00,292 --> 00:09:02,125
Sheldon, that's awful.
No.

206
00:09:02,127 --> 00:09:04,327
The Texas Rangers tracked them
down to their village

207
00:09:04,329 --> 00:09:05,996
and slaughtered
every last one of them, so...

208
00:09:05,998 --> 00:09:09,299
it was a happy ending.

209
00:09:09,301 --> 00:09:12,602
Well, for my nine-fingered Nana.

210
00:09:12,604 --> 00:09:15,438
Okay, back to the ring.
Does Amy even know about this?

211
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:18,642
No. She broke up with me before
I could broach the subject.

212
00:09:18,644 --> 00:09:21,177
Oh, man, I'm sorry...
that must have been devastating for you.

213
00:09:21,179 --> 00:09:22,679
No, not at all.
No, I'm fine.

214
00:09:22,681 --> 00:09:24,948
You know, Amy had reservations
about our relationship,

215
00:09:24,950 --> 00:09:26,616
so all worked out
for the best.

216
00:09:26,618 --> 00:09:29,786
- I know. It just...
- I said I'm fine!

217
00:09:34,426 --> 00:09:37,327
We've gotten a little off-topic.

218
00:09:37,329 --> 00:09:39,663
Allow me to make things
entertaining again

219
00:09:39,665 --> 00:09:42,532
in this little Spockumentary.

220
00:09:46,463 --> 00:09:48,505
That was Leonard's joke.

221
00:09:58,684 --> 00:10:01,752
As a child,
when faced with a dilemma,

222
00:10:01,754 --> 00:10:05,188
my mother encouraged me to ask,
"What would Jesus do?"

223
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:08,559
The answer to that was always,
"Love thy neighbor."

224
00:10:08,561 --> 00:10:13,063
But my neighbor had
a dead tooth, so...

225
00:10:13,065 --> 00:10:15,232
that wasn't going to happen.

226
00:10:15,234 --> 00:10:17,067
But...

227
00:10:17,069 --> 00:10:21,204
that's why I changed it
to, "What would Spock do?"

228
00:10:21,206 --> 00:10:22,806
Did you find that helpful?

229
00:10:22,808 --> 00:10:25,609
Yes. Oh, for example,
three years ago

230
00:10:25,611 --> 00:10:28,378
when I discovered Penny
was eating all my Pop-Tarts,

231
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:31,148
instead of getting angry
or vindictive,

232
00:10:31,150 --> 00:10:33,784
you know, I got a floor safe.

233
00:10:33,786 --> 00:10:37,087
I knew I could smell 'em.

234
00:10:37,089 --> 00:10:39,089
What about
from when you were a kid?

235
00:10:39,091 --> 00:10:41,692
Oh, certainly.
Uh, when I was eight years old,

236
00:10:41,694 --> 00:10:43,961
Billy Sparks cornered me
in the playground.

237
00:10:43,963 --> 00:10:46,396
I asked myself,
"What would Spock do?"

238
00:10:46,398 --> 00:10:48,932
Then I grabbed Billy
on his shoulder

239
00:10:48,934 --> 00:10:52,302
and performed
my first Vulcan nerve pinch.

240
00:10:53,706 --> 00:10:54,938
Did it work?

241
00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:57,240
Oh, no... he broke my collarbone.

242
00:10:58,143 --> 00:11:01,678
I can still hear it click.

243
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,128
That must have been
very upsetting for you.

244
00:11:03,152 --> 00:11:04,649
Oh, not at all.

245
00:11:04,650 --> 00:11:07,517
As I said, the entire point
of emulating Spock

246
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:09,920
was to rise above human emotion,

247
00:11:09,922 --> 00:11:12,122
which I've spent
a lifetime mastering.

248
00:11:12,124 --> 00:11:13,657
Oh...

249
00:11:14,493 --> 00:11:16,560
Excuse me?

250
00:11:16,562 --> 00:11:18,695
I'm sorry.
I'm not here.

251
00:11:18,697 --> 00:11:21,164
- No. You went.
- What does mean?

252
00:11:21,166 --> 00:11:22,532
Um...

253
00:11:22,534 --> 00:11:24,668
You did go.

254
00:11:24,670 --> 00:11:26,837
All right, fine.
Well, Sheldon, I'm no expert,

255
00:11:26,839 --> 00:11:29,439
but aren't you completely
missing the point of Spock?

256
00:11:29,441 --> 00:11:30,741
I mean, he liked to act

257
00:11:30,743 --> 00:11:33,043
like he had no emotions,
but he was still half human.

258
00:11:33,045 --> 00:11:34,511
Just like you.

259
00:11:35,748 --> 00:11:37,147
I'm just saying,
you pretend you don't,

260
00:11:37,149 --> 00:11:38,882
but you have feelings
just like everybody else.

261
00:11:38,884 --> 00:11:41,351
Not true. No, look at me.

262
00:11:41,353 --> 00:11:43,620
I had an engagement
ring to give a girl,

263
00:11:43,622 --> 00:11:45,188
and instead,
she rejected me.

264
00:11:45,190 --> 00:11:47,057
And am I emotional
about that? No.

265
00:11:47,059 --> 00:11:49,226
No, I am sitting here
on a couch,

266
00:11:49,228 --> 00:11:51,028
talking about my
favorite TV character

267
00:11:51,030 --> 00:11:52,362
like nothing happened.

268
00:11:52,364 --> 00:11:54,931
'Cause I am just like him:
all logical, all the time.

269
00:11:54,933 --> 00:11:55,999
Sweetie, you're yelling.

270
00:11:56,001 --> 00:11:57,601
Because when I speak
at a regular volume,

271
00:11:57,603 --> 00:11:58,802
no one seems to believe me

272
00:11:58,804 --> 00:12:00,737
that I've put
this Amy nonsense behind me!

273
00:12:06,178 --> 00:12:10,247
This documentary
is gonna be awesome.

274
00:12:12,785 --> 00:12:15,485
You gonna be okay down here?
Yeah. Yeah,

275
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:16,953
I feel like
an archaeologist.

276
00:12:16,955 --> 00:12:20,424
Indiana Jones and
the Single-Family Dwelling.

277
00:12:21,293 --> 00:12:23,060
Hey. Look!

278
00:12:23,062 --> 00:12:24,961
Found a seashell.

279
00:12:24,963 --> 00:12:28,165
Yeah, that's a rat skull.

280
00:12:28,167 --> 00:12:30,067
Relax.

281
00:12:30,069 --> 00:12:33,637
There's enough droppings down
here without you making more.

282
00:12:33,639 --> 00:12:37,140
Sorry. Do you have a...
sense of where we are?

283
00:12:37,142 --> 00:12:39,076
Yeah. I think that's the den.

284
00:12:39,078 --> 00:12:41,945
Oh. Okay, so we must be
under the dining room.

285
00:12:41,947 --> 00:12:43,346
Uh-huh. Yep.

286
00:12:43,348 --> 00:12:46,116
You know, I know you
don't want to hear this,

287
00:12:46,118 --> 00:12:48,852
but it wouldn't take that
much work to turn that den

288
00:12:48,854 --> 00:12:50,654
into a nursery.

289
00:12:50,656 --> 00:12:52,856
Why wouldn't I want to hear it?

290
00:12:52,858 --> 00:12:55,158
'Cause Bernie said
you didn't want kids.

291
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:56,927
That's not true at all.

292
00:12:56,929 --> 00:12:58,361
I-I wish

293
00:12:58,363 --> 00:13:00,263
she'd get pregnant, believe me.

294
00:13:00,265 --> 00:13:04,067
I'm climbing on top of her
every chance I get.

295
00:13:05,104 --> 00:13:08,505
In a... loving
and respectful manner.

296
00:13:08,507 --> 00:13:09,539
Oh.

297
00:13:10,809 --> 00:13:12,109
The point is,

298
00:13:12,111 --> 00:13:15,112
I really do want kids.

299
00:13:15,114 --> 00:13:16,646
Huh.

300
00:13:16,648 --> 00:13:19,282
I don't know why
she's lying to you.

301
00:13:19,284 --> 00:13:21,251
She's the one
who doesn't want kids.

302
00:13:21,253 --> 00:13:22,953
In fact, every time I
bring up the subject...

303
00:13:22,955 --> 00:13:24,788
Earthquake!

304
00:13:26,859 --> 00:13:29,159
Oh, my God,
we're gonna die!

305
00:13:29,161 --> 00:13:31,061
Earthquake!

306
00:13:31,697 --> 00:13:34,865
Aftershock...!

307
00:13:36,034 --> 00:13:38,769
I can't believe Sheldon was
gonna ask Amy to marry him.

308
00:13:38,771 --> 00:13:40,270
I know.
I also can't believe

309
00:13:40,272 --> 00:13:42,205
he watched what we did
on that couch

310
00:13:42,207 --> 00:13:44,441
and still sits on it.
Yeah.

311
00:13:46,044 --> 00:13:47,811
Hello.

312
00:13:47,813 --> 00:13:49,146
Hey, buddy.
How you doing?

313
00:13:49,148 --> 00:13:50,180
Better.

314
00:13:50,182 --> 00:13:52,182
Did Wil and Adam leave?
Yeah.

315
00:13:52,184 --> 00:13:54,551
Do you think they're
going to put my outburst

316
00:13:54,553 --> 00:13:55,886
in the documentary?

317
00:13:55,888 --> 00:13:57,988
Definitely.
Oh, yeah.

318
00:13:57,990 --> 00:14:01,491
Well, there's no point
in dwelling on it.

319
00:14:01,493 --> 00:14:03,059
As the Vulcans say,

320
00:14:03,061 --> 00:14:07,030
"Kup-fun-tor
ha'kiv na'ish Du stau."

321
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:10,200
Do you know what that means?
No.

322
00:14:10,202 --> 00:14:11,368
Are you telling the truth?

323
00:14:11,370 --> 00:14:13,470
Nirsh.

324
00:14:14,773 --> 00:14:17,174
Well, this is ridiculous.
Being upset about Amy

325
00:14:17,176 --> 00:14:18,909
all the time
isn't accomplishing anything.

326
00:14:18,911 --> 00:14:20,644
If I want to resolve
this situation,

327
00:14:20,646 --> 00:14:22,279
then I need to take action.

328
00:14:22,281 --> 00:14:24,481
What are you gonna do?
I'm going to find her

329
00:14:24,483 --> 00:14:25,615
and ask her to marry me.

330
00:14:25,617 --> 00:14:28,051
And if she says yes,
we can put this behind us

331
00:14:28,053 --> 00:14:29,786
and resume our relationship.

332
00:14:29,788 --> 00:14:31,488
And if she says no...

333
00:14:31,490 --> 00:14:34,925
well, then
she can just ponfo miran.

334
00:14:37,462 --> 00:14:39,629
He didn't meant that.

335
00:14:43,235 --> 00:14:47,571
So I should probably explain
why I kind of fibbed.

336
00:14:51,143 --> 00:14:53,376
That would be nice.

337
00:14:53,378 --> 00:14:55,712
I told my dad that
you were the one

338
00:14:55,714 --> 00:14:58,815
who didn't want kids because I
didn't want to disappoint him.

339
00:14:58,817 --> 00:15:01,451
But you were okay
throwing me under the bus?

340
00:15:01,453 --> 00:15:04,754
Turns out yeah,
I didn't think twice about it.

341
00:15:04,756 --> 00:15:08,225
Bernie, you don't need
to worry about me.

342
00:15:08,227 --> 00:15:10,794
But I don't want
to see you miss out.

343
00:15:10,796 --> 00:15:12,362
Raising children

344
00:15:12,364 --> 00:15:15,365
was the most rewarding
experience of my life.

345
00:15:15,367 --> 00:15:17,033
Oh, please.
Mom did everything.

346
00:15:17,035 --> 00:15:19,269
All you did was
come home from work,

347
00:15:19,271 --> 00:15:21,004
sit on the couch and drink beer.

348
00:15:21,006 --> 00:15:22,939
How is that raising kids?

349
00:15:22,941 --> 00:15:24,641
This is really

350
00:15:24,643 --> 00:15:26,676
a conversation
for husband and wife.

351
00:15:26,678 --> 00:15:29,779
I'm gonna go clean up,
hit the road.

352
00:15:29,781 --> 00:15:32,849
If your mother asks,
I was here till 10:00.

353
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:38,288
It's interesting your father
didn't help around the house

354
00:15:38,290 --> 00:15:40,290
and Howard doesn't help, either,

355
00:15:40,292 --> 00:15:41,758
so... in a way,

356
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:44,127
Howard's not only
like your father,

357
00:15:44,129 --> 00:15:48,865
but he's also like the child
that you're afraid to have.

358
00:15:49,735 --> 00:15:51,868
Why are you still here?

359
00:15:53,939 --> 00:15:55,705
Fine, I'll leave.

360
00:15:55,707 --> 00:15:58,842
But it sounds like
somebody needs a fresh diaper.

361
00:16:03,916 --> 00:16:05,282
All right...

362
00:16:05,284 --> 00:16:08,351
I admit...
that I don't help out a lot.

363
00:16:08,353 --> 00:16:11,087
And I need to work on that.

364
00:16:11,089 --> 00:16:12,222
But...

365
00:16:12,224 --> 00:16:13,757
if we had a kid,

366
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:15,025
it would be different.

367
00:16:15,027 --> 00:16:16,660
Why?
Because...

368
00:16:16,662 --> 00:16:18,995
when my dad left,

369
00:16:18,997 --> 00:16:21,364
I promised myself that...

370
00:16:21,366 --> 00:16:25,802
if I ever had a chance
to be a father...

371
00:16:25,804 --> 00:16:28,204
I'd always be there.

372
00:16:29,741 --> 00:16:31,908
Okay, I'll think about it.

373
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:33,977
And this an actual
"I'll think about it,"

374
00:16:33,979 --> 00:16:36,012
not like the
"can we get a motorcycle

375
00:16:36,014 --> 00:16:38,548
with a sidecar
I'll think about it"?

376
00:16:39,618 --> 00:16:42,185
It's an actual
"I'll think about it."

377
00:16:42,187 --> 00:16:46,089
I really believe
I'd be a great dad.

378
00:16:46,091 --> 00:16:48,558
I know you would.

379
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:50,360
Speaking of...

380
00:16:50,362 --> 00:16:52,829
making babies,
what do you say I wash up

381
00:16:52,831 --> 00:16:55,465
and poke around your crawlspace?

382
00:17:31,414 --> 00:17:33,314
Dr. Dana feels
he isn't that dangerous.

383
00:17:33,316 --> 00:17:35,816
What makes you right and
a trained psychiatrist wrong?

384
00:17:35,818 --> 00:17:38,085
Because she feels. I don't.

385
00:17:38,087 --> 00:17:39,620
All I know is logic.

386
00:17:39,622 --> 00:17:41,322
Yeah, right.

387
00:17:42,492 --> 00:17:44,292
You can just shut
your feelings off.

388
00:17:44,294 --> 00:17:46,661
There goes television,
lying to us again.

389
00:17:46,663 --> 00:17:47,862
We let you

390
00:17:47,864 --> 00:17:48,963
raise our children,

391
00:17:48,965 --> 00:17:50,998
and this is the thanks we get.

392
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,467
Leonard, how could I
have been so foolish

393
00:17:53,469 --> 00:17:55,603
to try and follow
in the footsteps

394
00:17:55,605 --> 00:17:58,472
of a made-up alien race
with no emotions?

395
00:17:58,474 --> 00:18:00,041
Well...

396
00:18:00,043 --> 00:18:02,043
now instead of idolizing
fictional characters,

397
00:18:02,045 --> 00:18:06,013
you can focus on the real people
who are already in your life.

398
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:09,850
Those are very wise words.

399
00:18:09,852 --> 00:18:11,052
Thank you.

400
00:18:11,054 --> 00:18:12,453
They'd just be
so much more comforting

401
00:18:12,455 --> 00:18:14,155
if they came
out of a television.

402
