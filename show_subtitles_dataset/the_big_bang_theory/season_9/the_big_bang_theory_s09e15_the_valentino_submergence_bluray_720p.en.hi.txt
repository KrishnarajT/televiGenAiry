1
00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:02,257
Hey, gentlemen.
Hey. - Hey.

2
00:00:02,259 --> 00:00:04,059
Hello.
If any of you are looking for

3
00:00:04,061 --> 00:00:06,961
something to do on Valentine's
Day, Amy and I'll be streaming

4
00:00:06,963 --> 00:00:10,198
our first-ever live episode
of Fun With Flags.

5
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:12,500
You're welcome to join us
as we celebrate the timeless

6
00:00:12,502 --> 00:00:16,471
love affair between
wind and flapping fabric.

7
00:00:16,473 --> 00:00:18,640
Penny and I have dinner
reservations that night,

8
00:00:18,642 --> 00:00:21,142
but any other time, no.

9
00:00:22,913 --> 00:00:23,978
Sorry, Bernie and I
are breaking in

10
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:26,014
the new hot tub,
if you know what I mean.

11
00:00:26,016 --> 00:00:28,049
Not a clue. Raj?

12
00:00:28,051 --> 00:00:30,719
Spending Valentine's Day
with Emily.

13
00:00:30,721 --> 00:00:31,953
You don't sound

14
00:00:31,955 --> 00:00:33,321
very excited about it.

15
00:00:33,323 --> 00:00:35,590
Oh, I am, I am.
I g... I guess

16
00:00:35,592 --> 00:00:37,959
I'm still wondering if Emily
and I are right for each other.

17
00:00:37,961 --> 00:00:41,129
Does this have to do with
that girl you had coffee with?

18
00:00:41,131 --> 00:00:44,299
You mean the strong, sexy angel
I can't stop thinking about?

19
00:00:44,301 --> 00:00:46,501
Who can say?

20
00:00:46,503 --> 00:00:49,337
You've been talking about
breaking up with Emily forever.

21
00:00:49,339 --> 00:00:51,139
Why don't you just do it already?
Yeah, just

22
00:00:51,141 --> 00:00:52,307
get it over with.
Well, you

23
00:00:52,309 --> 00:00:53,508
say it like it's easy.

24
00:00:53,510 --> 00:00:54,709
Have any one of you

25
00:00:54,711 --> 00:00:56,578
ever broken up with anyone?

26
00:01:00,217 --> 00:01:02,817
No.
Not really.

27
00:01:02,819 --> 00:01:06,521
You know, uh, once I ordered
an Uber by accident.

28
00:01:06,523 --> 00:01:09,891

== sync, corrected by elderman ==
@elder_man

39
00:01:39,791 --> 00:01:42,559
So, you really
gonna break up with her?

40
00:01:42,561 --> 00:01:46,129
Yeah, I think so.
Do you have any advice?

41
00:01:46,131 --> 00:01:48,632
Well, I have broken up
with my fair share of guys.

42
00:01:48,634 --> 00:01:50,934
I mean, how many times
did I break up with Leonard?

43
00:01:50,936 --> 00:01:53,837
I stopped
counting at four.

44
00:01:53,839 --> 00:01:55,872
All right, my advice to you
is do it at her place

45
00:01:55,874 --> 00:01:57,707
so you can leave
when you need to,

46
00:01:57,709 --> 00:01:59,042
uh, tell the truth,
make it quick

47
00:01:59,044 --> 00:02:01,645
and be prepared for tears.

48
00:02:01,647 --> 00:02:03,313
Oh, I'm gonna do a pre-cry
before I go in there.

49
00:02:03,315 --> 00:02:05,882
Really dry myself out.

50
00:02:06,785 --> 00:02:08,418
She meant Emily.

51
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:11,788
No, I-I really didn't.

52
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:14,591
You're seriously
breaking up with me?

53
00:02:14,593 --> 00:02:15,859
Yeah.

54
00:02:15,861 --> 00:02:17,327
And you thought
right before Valentine's Day

55
00:02:17,329 --> 00:02:19,129
was a good time to do it?

56
00:02:20,465 --> 00:02:23,500
You're right...
let's talk again in a few days.

57
00:02:23,502 --> 00:02:27,270
Hey, Claire.
Hi. It's-it's Rajesh.

58
00:02:27,272 --> 00:02:29,906
I was-I was wondering if you're
free for Valentine's Day?

59
00:02:29,908 --> 00:02:32,409
Sorry, I just got back
with my boyfriend.

60
00:02:32,411 --> 00:02:34,578
But I just broke up
with my girlfriend.

61
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:36,546
Right before Valentine's Day?

62
00:02:36,548 --> 00:02:38,648
What an ass.

63
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:40,984
Please take me back.
Our love was meant to be!

64
00:02:42,821 --> 00:02:46,256
I'm gonna all alone
on Valentine's Day.

65
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:51,494
Well, you were
right... tears.

66
00:02:52,664 --> 00:02:56,399
Okay, and we are live
in 22 minutes.

67
00:02:56,401 --> 00:02:58,301
I'm nervous.
I hope people

68
00:02:58,303 --> 00:03:01,104
will be around to watch even
though it's Valentine's Day.

69
00:03:01,106 --> 00:03:04,341
People who are fans
of an Internet show about flags?

70
00:03:04,343 --> 00:03:06,509
Trust me, they're around.

71
00:03:06,511 --> 00:03:09,279
Oh, and speaking
of Valentine's Day, I haven't

72
00:03:09,281 --> 00:03:10,513
forgotten about you tonight.

73
00:03:10,515 --> 00:03:11,681
What do you mean?

74
00:03:11,683 --> 00:03:13,316
Well, you've become
such an integral

75
00:03:13,318 --> 00:03:15,852
part of my life
as well as this show,

76
00:03:15,854 --> 00:03:19,089
I felt it only right to include
your name in the title.

77
00:03:19,091 --> 00:03:21,157
Oh.

78
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:22,626
That is so sweet.

79
00:03:22,628 --> 00:03:25,996
So from now on, this program
will be officially known as

80
00:03:25,998 --> 00:03:27,998
Dr. Sheldon Cooper

81
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,499
and Dr. Amy
Farrah Fowler

82
00:03:29,501 --> 00:03:32,502
present Dr. Sheldon' Cooper's
Fun With Flags.

83
00:03:35,841 --> 00:03:37,207
Catchy.

84
00:03:41,346 --> 00:03:45,215
I'm gonna
check the temp on the tub.

85
00:03:45,217 --> 00:03:46,449
Don't make it too hot.

86
00:03:46,451 --> 00:03:48,118
Sorry, but "too hot"

87
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:50,487
is the only temperature
I come in.

88
00:03:56,161 --> 00:03:57,360
Look at that...

89
00:03:57,362 --> 00:03:59,663
you shaved it all.

90
00:04:00,932 --> 00:04:02,332
You're welcome.

91
00:04:04,703 --> 00:04:07,504
Um, question...
this is my first hot tub...

92
00:04:07,506 --> 00:04:11,007
is it supposed to come with
a rat flopping around in it?

93
00:04:11,009 --> 00:04:14,811
Ew, really? Get it out.

94
00:04:14,813 --> 00:04:16,713
How?
Uh...

95
00:04:16,715 --> 00:04:17,914
wish we had a skimmer.

96
00:04:17,916 --> 00:04:19,115
Uh, you turn off the jets,

97
00:04:19,117 --> 00:04:21,785
I'll get a strainer
from the kitchen.

98
00:04:21,787 --> 00:04:23,453
I don't know how
to turn off the jets.

99
00:04:23,455 --> 00:04:26,556
Good, I don't know
where we keep the strainer.

100
00:04:28,136 --> 00:04:30,080
Excuse me.

101
00:04:30,081 --> 00:04:31,580
Uh, bad news.

102
00:04:31,582 --> 00:04:33,682
The maître d' said
it's gonna be at least an hour.

103
00:04:33,684 --> 00:04:35,884
An hour? What? That's crazy.
We have a reservation.

104
00:04:35,886 --> 00:04:37,786
I know.
So what did you say?

105
00:04:37,788 --> 00:04:40,422
Thanks, sorry to bother you.

106
00:04:40,424 --> 00:04:44,393
But I said it like a badass.

107
00:04:45,563 --> 00:04:46,762
All right, well,
can't you, like,

108
00:04:46,764 --> 00:04:48,230
slip him some money
or something?

109
00:04:48,232 --> 00:04:50,299
Really? I've never done that
before. Does it work?

110
00:04:50,301 --> 00:04:53,035
Do people like money...
is that what you're asking?

111
00:04:53,037 --> 00:04:54,970
A... a lot of attitude
from the woman

112
00:04:54,972 --> 00:04:57,539
who thought MC squared
was a rapper.

113
00:04:57,541 --> 00:04:59,742
Now, is that a smart thing
to say on a holiday

114
00:04:59,744 --> 00:05:02,011
that's basically
national sex night?

115
00:05:02,013 --> 00:05:04,647
I'm sorry.
You're pretty, I'm stupid.

116
00:05:06,817 --> 00:05:08,617
Hello. Uh,

117
00:05:08,619 --> 00:05:10,519
just checked again
for Hofstadter.

118
00:05:10,521 --> 00:05:11,520
Still gonna be an hour?

119
00:05:11,522 --> 00:05:12,955
I'm afraid so.

120
00:05:12,957 --> 00:05:15,157
Okay. Thanks.

121
00:05:16,394 --> 00:05:17,860
Hey.

122
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:20,496
I think

123
00:05:20,498 --> 00:05:23,198
you may have dropped this?

124
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,800
Oh.

125
00:05:24,802 --> 00:05:26,435
Did anybody lose a 20?

126
00:05:26,437 --> 00:05:28,637
I did.

127
00:05:38,449 --> 00:05:40,316
Oh, I took care of it.

128
00:05:42,687 --> 00:05:44,386
, we are live

129
00:05:44,388 --> 00:05:47,890
in five,
four, three...

130
00:05:47,892 --> 00:05:49,558
Oh, wait. Oh, shoot,
I already pushed the button.

131
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:50,626
Never mind, we're live.

132
00:05:50,628 --> 00:05:52,861
Uh, hello

133
00:05:52,863 --> 00:05:54,763
and welcome to a
special live edition

134
00:05:54,765 --> 00:05:56,598
of Dr. Sheldon Cooper...

135
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:59,101
and Dr. Amy Farrah Fowler
present...

136
00:05:59,103 --> 00:06:02,071
Dr. Sheldon Cooper's
Fun With Flags.

137
00:06:03,874 --> 00:06:05,674
Consider tonight's episode

138
00:06:05,676 --> 00:06:08,844
a Valentine's Day gift
for you, our viewers.

139
00:06:09,947 --> 00:06:12,848
It's also my gift to you.
That was clear, right?

140
00:06:12,850 --> 00:06:14,410
'Cause you're not
getting anything else.

141
00:06:16,087 --> 00:06:17,586
Since we're live,

142
00:06:17,588 --> 00:06:19,421
you'll finally
be able to reach out to us

143
00:06:19,423 --> 00:06:22,358
with your flag thoughts
and flag questions.

144
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:25,761
Allow us to answer a few quick
ones that we get all the time.

145
00:06:25,763 --> 00:06:28,263
Uh, uh, yes, I
really am a doctor.

146
00:06:28,265 --> 00:06:31,333
Uh, yes, she really
is my girlfriend.

147
00:06:31,335 --> 00:06:34,169
No, I just blink a lot,

148
00:06:34,171 --> 00:06:36,405
it's not Morse code
for "rescue me."

149
00:06:43,647 --> 00:06:45,280
Oh, uh, ok...

150
00:06:45,282 --> 00:06:48,350
Uh, here's our first call.

151
00:06:48,352 --> 00:06:50,819
Hello, and welcome
to Fun With Flags.

152
00:06:50,821 --> 00:06:52,454
What's your question?

153
00:06:52,456 --> 00:06:54,022
What is wrong with me?

154
00:06:54,024 --> 00:06:56,225
Why am I so self-destructive?

155
00:06:58,229 --> 00:06:59,695
Rajesh?

156
00:06:59,697 --> 00:07:04,199
Yes.

157
00:07:04,201 --> 00:07:06,835
You two look happy...
how do you do it?

158
00:07:06,837 --> 00:07:07,776
I-I think it starts
with good communication.

159
00:07:07,777 --> 00:07:10,862
Yeah, wait, that's not a flag
question. Next caller.

160
00:07:13,444 --> 00:07:16,078
I hope you don't think
I'm just saying this

161
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,614
because it's
Valentine's Day, but...

162
00:07:18,616 --> 00:07:20,582
I love you so much.

163
00:07:20,584 --> 00:07:22,818
I'm gonna put this
down your robe.

164
00:07:25,589 --> 00:07:27,956
It's not moving,
but I think it's still alive.

165
00:07:27,958 --> 00:07:31,260
Well, should we put it back
in there a few minutes?

166
00:07:32,329 --> 00:07:33,929
No.

167
00:07:33,931 --> 00:07:36,765
No, and it's not a rat,
it's a rabbit.

168
00:07:36,767 --> 00:07:39,034
We need to save it.

169
00:07:39,036 --> 00:07:40,536
Well, how do we do that?

170
00:07:40,538 --> 00:07:42,538
Um, I don't know,
look it up on your phone.

171
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:44,606
I-I'm gonna wrap it in a towel.

172
00:07:44,608 --> 00:07:46,608
Um... "taking care

173
00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:48,744
of injured rabbit."

174
00:07:48,746 --> 00:07:50,078
Okay.

175
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,414
Make sure
it's comfortable and warm.

176
00:07:52,416 --> 00:07:55,551
Well, it was just in a hot tub.
I'm gonna say "check."

177
00:07:55,553 --> 00:07:56,985
Anything else?

178
00:07:56,987 --> 00:07:58,287
To make sure it's
not dehydrated,

179
00:07:58,289 --> 00:07:59,655
feed him an
electrolyte solution.

180
00:07:59,657 --> 00:08:00,923
If it's not responding,

181
00:08:00,925 --> 00:08:04,293
use a warm cloth to wash
its face and genitals.

182
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:08,430
Yeah.

183
00:08:11,469 --> 00:08:12,935
This is ridiculous.

184
00:08:12,937 --> 00:08:15,103
You know, I'm gonna
go talk to the maître d'.

185
00:08:15,105 --> 00:08:16,572
What are you gonna say?

186
00:08:16,574 --> 00:08:19,274
I don't know.
I'm... I'm gonna flirt with him.

187
00:08:19,276 --> 00:08:21,577
I don't know
if I'm comfortable with that.

188
00:08:21,579 --> 00:08:23,278
I'm still
sleeping with you tonight.

189
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:26,482
See if you can
get a table by the window.

190
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:32,454
Hi there.
What's your name?

191
00:08:32,456 --> 00:08:33,622
Glen.
Oh, boy,

192
00:08:33,624 --> 00:08:36,592
it is crazy in here
tonight, huh, Glen?

193
00:08:36,594 --> 00:08:39,361
Well, you know, Valentine's Day.
Yes. Oh,

194
00:08:39,363 --> 00:08:42,297
bet your girlfriend is super
bummed you had to work tonight.

195
00:08:43,234 --> 00:08:45,467
Anyway, look, we have been
waiting a while,

196
00:08:45,469 --> 00:08:46,902
and I just...
With all

197
00:08:46,904 --> 00:08:49,905
due respect, ma'am,
there's nothing I can do.

198
00:08:49,907 --> 00:08:52,975
You don't have to call me ma'am.

199
00:08:52,977 --> 00:08:54,443
Okay.
I mean,

200
00:08:54,445 --> 00:08:55,677
we're basically the same age.

201
00:08:55,679 --> 00:08:57,513
Okay.

202
00:09:01,719 --> 00:09:02,918
How old are you?

203
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:05,220
I'm 21. How old are you?

204
00:09:06,123 --> 00:09:07,589
Just shut up, Glen.

205
00:09:08,726 --> 00:09:10,259
Come on, let's get out of here.

206
00:09:10,261 --> 00:09:13,362
What? Why?
Because I'm young. Let's go.

207
00:09:14,565 --> 00:09:17,132
Rajesh,
it's perfectly normal

208
00:09:17,134 --> 00:09:19,568
to have doubts
after breaking up with someone.

209
00:09:19,570 --> 00:09:21,370
Well, you really think so?

210
00:09:21,372 --> 00:09:23,505
Yeah, you know
what's not normal?

211
00:09:23,507 --> 00:09:26,942
Blubbering about emotions
during a flag show.

212
00:09:26,944 --> 00:09:30,112
Unless that emotion is
excitement over New Zealand

213
00:09:30,114 --> 00:09:31,680
changing their flag.

214
00:09:31,682 --> 00:09:35,083
Yeah, good luck, you crazy
Kiwis, we're rooting for you.

215
00:09:35,085 --> 00:09:37,085
Your friend is hurting.

216
00:09:37,087 --> 00:09:38,453
No,

217
00:09:38,455 --> 00:09:39,688
Sheldon's right.

218
00:09:39,690 --> 00:09:40,923
Emily did say I always

219
00:09:40,925 --> 00:09:42,958
talk about my feelings too much.

220
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,826
I-I suppose that

221
00:09:44,828 --> 00:09:47,563
could be a legitimate
concern in a relationship.

222
00:09:47,565 --> 00:09:50,432
Uh, perhaps even
a-a red flag.

223
00:09:50,434 --> 00:09:52,668
And speaking
of red flags,

224
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:56,004
check out this sexy number
from the former Soviet Union.

225
00:09:56,006 --> 00:09:57,806
Hubba, hubba.

226
00:10:00,077 --> 00:10:03,145
Oh. Uh, we-we have
another caller.

227
00:10:03,147 --> 00:10:05,881
Hi. You're on
Fun with Flags.

228
00:10:05,883 --> 00:10:11,486
Hello. I want to talk
about how lonely I am, too.

229
00:10:11,488 --> 00:10:13,555
Kripke? Is that you?

230
00:10:13,557 --> 00:10:16,058
Yeah, I'm just sitting here
all by myself

231
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:19,361
wondering if I'll ever find
someone to share my life with.

232
00:10:19,363 --> 00:10:21,997
Preferably Asian, 18-24,
no fatties.

233
00:10:24,635 --> 00:10:27,603
Please, all comments
and questions

234
00:10:27,605 --> 00:10:29,304
should be flag-related.

235
00:10:29,306 --> 00:10:33,241
All right. Is my pole
flag-related?

236
00:10:39,516 --> 00:10:42,784
I don't see why not.

237
00:10:50,637 --> 00:10:52,804
He's eating.
That's a good sign.

238
00:10:52,806 --> 00:10:54,673
You're gonna have
to wait one hour

239
00:10:54,675 --> 00:10:57,008
until you can go swimming again.

240
00:10:58,479 --> 00:11:01,146
He's pretty cute.
He is.

241
00:11:01,148 --> 00:11:04,049
Should we... name him?

242
00:11:04,051 --> 00:11:06,118
It is Valentine's Day.

243
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:08,253
How about Valentino?

244
00:11:09,089 --> 00:11:12,224
Nice. A classic rabbit name.

245
00:11:13,827 --> 00:11:17,896
Peter Rabbit, Roger Rabbit.
Valentino Wolowitz Rabbit.

246
00:11:19,566 --> 00:11:22,300
Oh, look at all that
chest hair and overbite.

247
00:11:22,302 --> 00:11:24,069
Of course you're a Wolowitz.

248
00:11:26,006 --> 00:11:28,206
Son of a bitch! He bit me!

249
00:11:28,208 --> 00:11:30,108
Are you okay?

250
00:11:30,110 --> 00:11:31,476
No, I'm not okay!

251
00:11:31,478 --> 00:11:33,378
Wild rabbits
can have rabies!

252
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:36,214
Oh. Well, why did you put
your finger near its mouth?

253
00:11:36,216 --> 00:11:39,050
Poor judgment, obviously.

254
00:11:39,052 --> 00:11:42,654
He's so little. I'm sure it's fine.
How can it be fine?

255
00:11:42,656 --> 00:11:46,258
I just got attacked by a clearly
anti-Semitic wild animal.

256
00:11:48,529 --> 00:11:52,597
It's not what we planned,
but this isn't so bad, right?

257
00:11:52,599 --> 00:11:56,067
It is freaking amazing.

258
00:11:56,069 --> 00:11:58,603
Well, glad
you're feeling better.

259
00:11:58,605 --> 00:12:00,639
I was just hungry and cranky,

260
00:12:00,641 --> 00:12:03,141
and I've never been called
"ma'am" before.

261
00:12:03,143 --> 00:12:04,643
Is that a big deal?

262
00:12:04,645 --> 00:12:07,612
Kind of. When was the first time
someone called you "sir"?

263
00:12:07,614 --> 00:12:09,047
Sixth grade,

264
00:12:09,049 --> 00:12:11,983
but I wore a sport coat
and carried a briefcase, so...

265
00:12:12,819 --> 00:12:15,921
Can you believe
when I met you I was 22?

266
00:12:15,923 --> 00:12:17,822
I mean, it's crazy!

267
00:12:17,824 --> 00:12:19,524
Where did all that time go?

268
00:12:19,526 --> 00:12:23,528
Mm, you watched
The Bachelor a lot.

269
00:12:23,530 --> 00:12:25,363
Yeah, go ahead and make jokes,

270
00:12:25,365 --> 00:12:27,098
but your thirties
are almost over.

271
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:28,533
No, they're not.

272
00:12:28,535 --> 00:12:30,435
You're closer to 40
than you are 30.

273
00:12:30,437 --> 00:12:34,005
Ha, ha! You
married an old man.

274
00:12:34,007 --> 00:12:35,974
Tell you what.

275
00:12:35,976 --> 00:12:37,475
Let's do something
fun tonight.

276
00:12:37,477 --> 00:12:38,777
Won't make us any younger.

277
00:12:38,779 --> 00:12:41,413
Well, maybe not, but some
day we actually will be old,

278
00:12:41,415 --> 00:12:43,248
and we'll look
back on this night

279
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:45,383
and remember what
a good time we had.

280
00:12:45,385 --> 00:12:47,352
Okay, like what?

281
00:12:47,354 --> 00:12:50,455
I know. Food fight!

282
00:12:55,896 --> 00:12:58,496
I'll keep thinking.

283
00:13:00,834 --> 00:13:04,236
Look, I know you both feel bad
about being alone, but sometimes

284
00:13:04,238 --> 00:13:07,639
the best thing you can do is
take a little time for yourself,

285
00:13:07,641 --> 00:13:10,108
especially when you just
got out of a relationship.

286
00:13:10,110 --> 00:13:12,344
Speaking of ending
relationships,

287
00:13:12,346 --> 00:13:16,715
when British Honduras
became Belize,

288
00:13:16,717 --> 00:13:19,451
they designed a new
flag with a tree on it,

289
00:13:19,453 --> 00:13:23,488
and I would like to hang
myself from that tree.

290
00:13:27,828 --> 00:13:30,695
But, Amy,
when you and Sheldon split up,

291
00:13:30,697 --> 00:13:32,897
didn't you start dating someone
right away?

292
00:13:32,899 --> 00:13:35,433
Well, I... I wouldn't
say right away.

293
00:13:35,435 --> 00:13:38,403
And actually, it was
three different men.

294
00:13:38,405 --> 00:13:40,272
Three different men?

295
00:13:40,274 --> 00:13:45,010
Damn, girl,
way to give the milk away?

296
00:13:45,012 --> 00:13:47,579
Oh, looks like
we just lost Kripke.

297
00:13:47,581 --> 00:13:50,782
Actually, I'm still here.

298
00:13:50,784 --> 00:13:52,817
Now?
Yup.

299
00:13:52,819 --> 00:13:54,653
Now?
Yup!

300
00:13:54,655 --> 00:13:56,655
Now?

301
00:13:56,657 --> 00:14:00,191
Oh, looks like
we just lost Kripke.

302
00:14:00,193 --> 00:14:02,160
Before Emily,
I was alone for so long.

303
00:14:02,162 --> 00:14:04,696
I just... I don't know
if I can do that again.

304
00:14:04,698 --> 00:14:06,231
Well, you know,
here is something

305
00:14:06,233 --> 00:14:07,565
that might cheer you up.

306
00:14:07,567 --> 00:14:11,536
The flag of the Isle of Man
is nothing but three legs

307
00:14:11,538 --> 00:14:14,873
sharing a weird pair
of underpants, so...

308
00:14:14,875 --> 00:14:17,142
you think you
got problems.

309
00:14:18,645 --> 00:14:20,645
I have an idea.

310
00:14:20,647 --> 00:14:22,280
Maybe someone in our audience

311
00:14:22,282 --> 00:14:24,215
would be interested
in meeting Rajesh.

312
00:14:24,217 --> 00:14:26,217
Ladies, I can attest

313
00:14:26,219 --> 00:14:28,253
that he is a kind,
handsome, intelligent...

314
00:14:28,255 --> 00:14:31,056
Rich parents!
Don't forget, rich parents!

315
00:14:32,893 --> 00:14:35,327
spoiled astrophysicist
who not only...

316
00:14:36,897 --> 00:14:40,265
Oh. Well, that was quick.

317
00:14:40,267 --> 00:14:42,734
Hi. You're on
Fun with Flags.

318
00:14:42,736 --> 00:14:45,003
Hey, I think I got cut off.

319
00:14:47,541 --> 00:14:49,074
Hello, Kripke.

320
00:14:49,076 --> 00:14:51,276
I have a flag question.

321
00:14:51,278 --> 00:14:54,679
How many men
did you have sex with?

322
00:14:55,849 --> 00:14:59,017
Let's see. What's
young and fun?

323
00:14:59,019 --> 00:15:01,019
Uh, we could
go dancing.

324
00:15:01,021 --> 00:15:02,487
Are you actually
gonna dance?

325
00:15:02,489 --> 00:15:03,521
Of course.
Yeah.

326
00:15:03,523 --> 00:15:05,557
No one wants to see that.

327
00:15:05,559 --> 00:15:08,093
Hey, how about skinny dipping
at the beach?

328
00:15:08,095 --> 00:15:11,162
No, I don't need
any fish nibbling my business.

329
00:15:12,999 --> 00:15:14,999
Oh, there's a screening
of Moulin Rouge!

330
00:15:15,001 --> 00:15:16,768
I heard the crowd
sings along and stuff.

331
00:15:16,770 --> 00:15:18,470
That sounds fun.
When's it start?

332
00:15:18,472 --> 00:15:20,338
Midnight.

333
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:22,040
Midnight. Really?

334
00:15:22,042 --> 00:15:23,908
You know what? Let's do it.

335
00:15:23,910 --> 00:15:25,477
Okay, great!

336
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:28,980
Oh, wait. Uh, it's sold out.

337
00:15:28,982 --> 00:15:31,316
Oh, thank God.
Yes!

338
00:15:32,419 --> 00:15:34,719
It says, rabies
in rabbits is

339
00:15:34,721 --> 00:15:36,054
highly unlikely.

340
00:15:36,056 --> 00:15:37,989
Oh, terrific.
It's not terrific.

341
00:15:37,991 --> 00:15:39,758
Lots of highly unlikely things
happen.

342
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:43,561
You saw what's under this robe,
and you still married me.

343
00:15:43,563 --> 00:15:45,764
If you're really worried,
we'll take him to the vet

344
00:15:45,766 --> 00:15:46,965
and have him tested.
Good.

345
00:15:46,967 --> 00:15:49,334
Thank you. Oh, okay,
there is a test!

346
00:15:49,336 --> 00:15:51,336
All they have to do is...

347
00:15:51,338 --> 00:15:53,371
cut off his head
and check his brain.

348
00:15:53,373 --> 00:15:55,507
Oh, cut off his head?

349
00:15:55,509 --> 00:15:59,277
That's where
his little nose is.

350
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:02,580
He's not showing
any symptoms.

351
00:16:02,582 --> 00:16:06,351
I guess I'll just go to the
emergency room to be safe.

352
00:16:06,353 --> 00:16:08,620
Howie, this is just
your hypochondria.

353
00:16:08,622 --> 00:16:10,622
No, when I sat
on the mute button

354
00:16:10,624 --> 00:16:13,191
and thought I'd gone deaf,
that was my hypochondria.

355
00:16:21,768 --> 00:16:24,936
We'll find another time
to tell him I'm pregnant.

356
00:16:31,478 --> 00:16:33,611
I mean, this is the first time

357
00:16:33,613 --> 00:16:35,547
I've ever broken up
with someone.

358
00:16:35,549 --> 00:16:38,483
I just... I didn't realize
it was gonna hurt this much.

359
00:16:38,485 --> 00:16:40,452
It really can.

360
00:16:40,454 --> 00:16:42,654
All right.

361
00:16:43,957 --> 00:16:46,858
Nothing about
this is fun.

362
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:49,661
No one wants to
talk about flags,

363
00:16:49,663 --> 00:16:53,164
and I haven't spoken
in over ten minutes,

364
00:16:53,166 --> 00:16:56,434
so, enjoy your
new show, Internet.

365
00:16:56,436 --> 00:17:01,105
Dr. Amy Farrah Flower
Present... With.

366
00:17:03,610 --> 00:17:05,643
I'm sorry for bothering you.

367
00:17:05,645 --> 00:17:07,078
I'll hang up now.

368
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:08,613
No, hold on, Rajesh.

369
00:17:08,615 --> 00:17:10,515
You know, you're not being
very sympathetic.

370
00:17:10,517 --> 00:17:12,650
You know firsthand
that breakups are hard.

371
00:17:12,652 --> 00:17:15,086
Fine.

372
00:17:15,088 --> 00:17:17,755
If you insist on making
me a part of this,

373
00:17:17,757 --> 00:17:20,124
yes, I knowledge how
painful they can be.

374
00:17:20,126 --> 00:17:24,729
However, pain has an
evolutionary purpose.

375
00:17:24,731 --> 00:17:27,632
It provides information
from the environment

376
00:17:27,634 --> 00:17:30,201
that, uh, behavior
isn't good for us.

377
00:17:30,203 --> 00:17:32,670
Like when I fell in love
with that stripper

378
00:17:32,672 --> 00:17:34,873
and bought her a Prius.

379
00:17:36,910 --> 00:17:39,277
I'm just gonna push
all the buttons.

380
00:17:41,181 --> 00:17:43,882
Raj, now, I'm sorry
you're suffering.

381
00:17:43,884 --> 00:17:47,085
When Amy and I were
broken up, I also suffered.

382
00:17:47,087 --> 00:17:49,454
And this may
sound surprising,

383
00:17:49,456 --> 00:17:51,823
but I'm grateful for
having gone through it.

384
00:17:51,825 --> 00:17:53,825
Really?

385
00:17:53,827 --> 00:17:55,860
Yes.

386
00:17:55,862 --> 00:18:00,231
I believe our relationship
now is stronger than ever.

387
00:18:00,233 --> 00:18:02,834
So do I.

388
00:18:02,836 --> 00:18:04,269
When-when we were apart,

389
00:18:04,271 --> 00:18:06,437
I learned how important
you are to me.

390
00:18:06,439 --> 00:18:08,606
And I realize

391
00:18:08,608 --> 00:18:11,209
that when two people are
in love, sometimes they...

392
00:18:11,211 --> 00:18:13,378
Happy Valentine's Day!

393
00:18:17,217 --> 00:18:19,617
We are young and fun!

394
00:18:24,925 --> 00:18:26,958
I stand corrected.

395
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:29,460
Fun.

396
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:41,215
Congratulations on a
successful live show.

397
00:18:41,217 --> 00:18:43,951
And a lovely
Valentine's Day.

398
00:18:45,988 --> 00:18:50,190
Cleaning up
is not young and fun.

399
00:18:50,192 --> 00:18:52,426
It can be.
Confetti fight!

400
00:18:57,567 --> 00:18:59,633
Maybe you should take a break.

401
00:18:59,635 --> 00:19:01,168
I got this.

402
00:19:03,773 --> 00:19:08,976
Did you know the singular
of confetti is "confetto"?

403
00:19:08,978 --> 00:19:12,813
Interesting, and when
would you use the singular?

404
00:19:12,815 --> 00:19:13,881
I'm glad you asked.

405
00:19:13,883 --> 00:19:16,951
Amy, you have a
confetto in your nose.

406
00:19:16,953 --> 00:19:20,158
No, no, no, no. Other
side. There you go.
