1
00:00:00,423 --> 00:00:02,590
it didn't work for my mom,
and it won't work for you.

2
00:00:04,394 --> 00:00:05,393
"Are."

3
00:00:05,395 --> 00:00:08,062
"We are..."

4
00:00:08,064 --> 00:00:09,731
"See spoons for more."

5
00:00:11,067 --> 00:00:12,467
What could it be?

6
00:00:12,469 --> 00:00:13,801
"We are Groot"?

7
00:00:13,803 --> 00:00:15,470
"We are the champions"?

8
00:00:15,472 --> 00:00:17,138
"We are family"?

9
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:18,973
"I got all my sisters with me."

10
00:00:23,313 --> 00:00:24,612
Are you serious?

11
00:00:24,614 --> 00:00:26,781
Yeah.

12
00:00:26,783 --> 00:00:30,084
Are you sure?

13
00:00:31,555 --> 00:00:33,855
Pretty positive.

14
00:00:33,857 --> 00:00:35,657
That's a joke, because
the pregnancy test says...

15
00:00:35,659 --> 00:00:37,191
Oh, my God.

16
00:00:39,996 --> 00:00:41,529
This is incredible.

17
00:00:41,531 --> 00:00:44,132
We're gonna be parents?

18
00:00:44,134 --> 00:00:47,602
We're gonna get
to board planes first.

19
00:00:48,738 --> 00:00:50,371
Finally gonna get to see

20
00:00:50,373 --> 00:00:53,875
what's in that family bathroom
at the mall.

21
00:00:53,877 --> 00:00:56,010
I know, it's crazy.

22
00:00:56,012 --> 00:00:58,112
It is crazy.

23
00:00:58,114 --> 00:00:59,414
Oh.

24
00:00:59,416 --> 00:01:03,151
I mean, how do you... prepare
for something like this?

25
00:01:03,153 --> 00:01:06,354
I'm not even sure
I've held a baby before.

26
00:01:06,356 --> 00:01:08,056
Oh, it's okay,
you'll figure it out.

27
00:01:08,058 --> 00:01:09,991
But how's this all gonna work?

28
00:01:09,993 --> 00:01:11,125
Do we get a nanny?

29
00:01:11,127 --> 00:01:12,360
I mean, can we
afford a nanny?

30
00:01:12,362 --> 00:01:14,162
And if we can,
we can't get a pretty one,

31
00:01:14,164 --> 00:01:16,130
'cause it'll wreck our marriage.

32
00:01:17,534 --> 00:01:20,635
We can't get an ugly one,
'cause it'll scare the kid.

33
00:01:22,505 --> 00:01:24,305
I-I don't know, Howie.

34
00:01:24,307 --> 00:01:25,773
Are we in a good
school district?

35
00:01:25,775 --> 00:01:27,008
You're Catholic, I'm Jewish.

36
00:01:27,010 --> 00:01:29,043
What religion do
we raise it?

37
00:01:29,045 --> 00:01:30,545
And if it's a boy,
do we get him circumcised?

38
00:01:30,547 --> 00:01:31,746
People say it's barbaric,

39
00:01:31,748 --> 00:01:34,649
but if we don't, it looks like
a pig in a blanket.

40
00:01:37,787 --> 00:01:40,221
Calm down, it's
gonna be okay.

41
00:01:40,223 --> 00:01:41,789
How's it gonna be okay?

42
00:01:41,791 --> 00:01:45,226
Look at me, I'm a mess.

43
00:01:45,228 --> 00:01:46,894
And that means this baby's
gonna half a mess.

44
00:01:46,896 --> 00:01:48,162
And that's even
before we screw it up

45
00:01:48,164 --> 00:01:50,965

@elder_man

56
00:02:21,401 --> 00:02:24,402
Hey, Raj, I read a couple
guys in your department

57
00:02:24,404 --> 00:02:26,504
may have discovered a new
planet in our solar system?

58
00:02:26,506 --> 00:02:28,239
Oh, I heard about that.

59
00:02:28,241 --> 00:02:29,774
Why didn't you
discover it?

60
00:02:29,776 --> 00:02:32,410
Because instead of being
in the telescope room,

61
00:02:32,412 --> 00:02:37,015
I was busy making you guys
homemade jam for the holidays.

62
00:02:37,017 --> 00:02:38,349
Well, you be sure
to let us know

63
00:02:38,351 --> 00:02:41,886
when you win the Nobel
Prize for boysenberry.

64
00:02:44,825 --> 00:02:46,357
Hey.

65
00:02:46,359 --> 00:02:47,425
Hello.
Hey, bud.

66
00:02:47,427 --> 00:02:48,927
Ready to play when you are.

67
00:02:48,929 --> 00:02:50,061
Yeah, um, in a minute.

68
00:02:50,063 --> 00:02:52,297
I actually need
to tell you guys something.

69
00:02:52,299 --> 00:02:53,798
If it's "thank you"
for the homemade jam

70
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,633
you got in December,
congratulations,

71
00:02:55,635 --> 00:02:58,002
you're the
first one.

72
00:02:58,004 --> 00:03:00,338
What's going on?

73
00:03:01,942 --> 00:03:04,309
I'm, uh...

74
00:03:04,311 --> 00:03:06,277
uh, gonna be a father.

75
00:03:06,279 --> 00:03:08,313
That's so amazing.
What? Congratulations.

76
00:03:08,315 --> 00:03:10,648
Oh, no.

77
00:03:11,585 --> 00:03:13,284
Why "oh, no"?

78
00:03:13,286 --> 00:03:15,253
Because this changes everything.

79
00:03:15,255 --> 00:03:16,621
What about comic book night?

80
00:03:16,623 --> 00:03:18,623
Uh, what about playing
games together?

81
00:03:18,625 --> 00:03:20,291
What about our trips
to Disneyland?

82
00:03:20,293 --> 00:03:23,428
How can we do those things
with a child around?

83
00:03:24,598 --> 00:03:27,432
Relax, there's room
for two babies in this group.

84
00:03:27,434 --> 00:03:28,800
Oh, dear L...

85
00:03:28,802 --> 00:03:30,702
Penny's pregnant, too?

86
00:03:30,704 --> 00:03:32,871
You're the other baby.

87
00:03:32,873 --> 00:03:34,305
Oh, really?

88
00:03:34,307 --> 00:03:37,575
Okay, well, would a baby have
to shave once every 11 days?

89
00:03:39,613 --> 00:03:42,180
Would an adult refuse
to eat his graham crackers

90
00:03:42,182 --> 00:03:44,282
because one of them was broken?

91
00:03:44,284 --> 00:03:46,150
I guess we'll call this a draw.

92
00:03:48,922 --> 00:03:50,688
So, I'm glad
you guys are here.

93
00:03:50,690 --> 00:03:52,290
There's something I want
to share with you.

94
00:03:52,292 --> 00:03:54,726
Howie and I are going to...

95
00:03:54,728 --> 00:03:56,361
Leonard says you're pregnant.

96
00:03:56,363 --> 00:03:57,629
What?

97
00:03:57,631 --> 00:03:58,530
"Don't say anything.

98
00:03:58,532 --> 00:04:00,431
Act surprised
when she tells you."

99
00:04:00,433 --> 00:04:02,333
All right,
how you want to do this?

100
00:04:03,770 --> 00:04:05,336
I'm pregnant.

101
00:04:05,338 --> 00:04:06,738
Oh, my God, I
can't believe it!

102
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:08,006
This is so exciting!

103
00:04:08,008 --> 00:04:10,675
Yeah, it's all real exciting.

104
00:04:10,677 --> 00:04:13,745
Are-are you not
happy about this?

105
00:04:13,747 --> 00:04:16,981
I am. Of-of course I am. I'm...

106
00:04:16,983 --> 00:04:18,516
I'm sure it's just the hormones.

107
00:04:19,753 --> 00:04:21,653
But it's weird... Howie's the one
who's been talking about

108
00:04:21,655 --> 00:04:23,087
having kids for years, and I was

109
00:04:23,089 --> 00:04:25,523
all excited to tell him because
I thought he'd be thrilled,

110
00:04:25,525 --> 00:04:27,292
but then he started to flip out

111
00:04:27,294 --> 00:04:29,160
and now this
feels like a bad idea

112
00:04:29,162 --> 00:04:32,163
and I'm gonna get fat.

113
00:04:32,165 --> 00:04:33,898
No, no, come on. Come on,
you're not gonna get fat.

114
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:35,567
You're gonna be beautiful
and glowing

115
00:04:35,569 --> 00:04:37,969
and-and have the cutest
little baby bump ever.

116
00:04:37,971 --> 00:04:40,238
Easy for you to say,
skinny bitch.

117
00:04:42,075 --> 00:04:44,042
Sorry, hormones.

118
00:04:44,044 --> 00:04:46,110
Oh, that's all right.
All I heard was "skinny."

119
00:04:47,013 --> 00:04:49,414
I wouldn't make too much
out of Howard

120
00:04:49,416 --> 00:04:51,145
not reacting the way
you expected him to.

121
00:04:51,169 --> 00:04:52,184
Yeah, I'm sure

122
00:04:52,185 --> 00:04:53,785
it was just
the initial shock of it all.

123
00:04:53,787 --> 00:04:55,954
You're probably right.

124
00:04:55,956 --> 00:04:58,623
After we talked about it,
he started to calm down.

125
00:04:58,625 --> 00:05:00,358
I shouldn't be raising a kid.

126
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:02,560
I don't even
eat my own vegetables.

127
00:05:03,763 --> 00:05:05,997
Buddy, I-I think
you might be overreacting.

128
00:05:05,999 --> 00:05:07,899
And then there's
this nose.

129
00:05:07,901 --> 00:05:10,969
I mean, what if he
looks like me?

130
00:05:12,238 --> 00:05:13,438
Or worse...

131
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,940
what if she looks like me?

132
00:05:15,942 --> 00:05:17,442
Not to mention

133
00:05:17,444 --> 00:05:19,444
the impact on our social circle.

134
00:05:19,446 --> 00:05:20,712
Everything's going to change.

135
00:05:20,714 --> 00:05:22,547
Howard won't be able
to come over as much.

136
00:05:22,549 --> 00:05:24,749
Well, he could bring the baby here.
Oh, but then we'd have to

137
00:05:24,751 --> 00:05:27,518
baby-proof the apartment.
You know, my sister

138
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,487
has one of those toilet locks
in her bathroom.

139
00:05:29,489 --> 00:05:32,357
I have two doctorates,
I still had to go in the sink.

140
00:05:34,294 --> 00:05:36,260
Oh, my God,
and do you have any idea

141
00:05:36,262 --> 00:05:39,397
how expensive having a kid is?

142
00:05:39,399 --> 00:05:41,833
I read that in Los Angeles,
raising a child through college

143
00:05:41,835 --> 00:05:43,801
can cost over a million dollars.

144
00:05:43,803 --> 00:05:45,870
A million dollars?

145
00:05:45,872 --> 00:05:49,574
God, it's like my nuts
just kicked me in the nuts.

146
00:05:50,844 --> 00:05:52,010
That's it... I got to start

147
00:05:52,012 --> 00:05:54,112
earning more money right now.

148
00:05:54,114 --> 00:05:55,780
I know...
you could ask Bernadette

149
00:05:55,782 --> 00:05:58,182
for a raise in your allowance.

150
00:05:58,184 --> 00:05:59,951
This isn't a joke.

151
00:05:59,953 --> 00:06:01,786
I wasn't joking.

152
00:06:03,890 --> 00:06:05,089
It'll be fine.

153
00:06:05,091 --> 00:06:06,557
People have kids every day.

154
00:06:06,559 --> 00:06:07,925
You'll figure this out.
Yeah, come on,

155
00:06:07,927 --> 00:06:09,961
this is great news
and you know it.

156
00:06:09,963 --> 00:06:11,863
Oh... You're right, it is,

157
00:06:11,865 --> 00:06:15,500
I'm just...
a little overwhelmed right now.

158
00:06:15,502 --> 00:06:17,769
Hey, you know what we should do?

159
00:06:17,771 --> 00:06:20,638
All get vasectomies so this
doesn't happen to us?

160
00:06:23,143 --> 00:06:25,510
Go out and celebrate.

161
00:06:26,446 --> 00:06:28,613
But not your worst idea.

162
00:06:30,784 --> 00:06:33,918
Hey, let's go do something
to get your mind off this.

163
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:36,187
Yeah, yeah, we should go out.
Where?

164
00:06:36,189 --> 00:06:37,488
Uh, I don't know, a bar?

165
00:06:37,490 --> 00:06:39,023
Can't drink.

166
00:06:39,025 --> 00:06:41,726
We can, but all right.

167
00:06:41,728 --> 00:06:44,062
Are you hungry? How about
that sushi place you love?

168
00:06:44,064 --> 00:06:47,065
Doctor said I can't have sushi.

169
00:06:47,067 --> 00:06:48,566
Okay, look, we don't
have to go anywhere.

170
00:06:48,568 --> 00:06:51,169
We can just, you know, stay here
and hang out in the hot tub.

171
00:06:51,171 --> 00:06:53,504
Doctor said I can't
go in the hot tub.

172
00:06:55,008 --> 00:06:56,808
Maybe you should
get a new doctor.

173
00:06:58,845 --> 00:07:02,413
What, he said
you can't laugh either?

174
00:07:03,616 --> 00:07:06,884
I'd like to propose a toast
to our friend, Howard...

175
00:07:06,886 --> 00:07:09,754
his, um, his big heart,
his beautiful soul...

176
00:07:09,756 --> 00:07:10,922
And his tight little pants

177
00:07:10,924 --> 00:07:13,224
that somehow
did not make him sterile.

178
00:07:13,226 --> 00:07:15,460
Cheers.

179
00:07:17,397 --> 00:07:19,263
Well, look at this.

180
00:07:19,265 --> 00:07:21,132
I bet whoever invented
tiny umbrellas

181
00:07:21,134 --> 00:07:22,967
doesn't have to worry
about money.

182
00:07:22,969 --> 00:07:25,369
He can have
all the kids he wants.

183
00:07:25,371 --> 00:07:28,706
And can keep a small portion
of their heads dry.

184
00:07:30,510 --> 00:07:33,411
If I'm gonna have any chance
of raising this kid,

185
00:07:33,413 --> 00:07:36,581
I need to come up with
a big idea to make some money.

186
00:07:36,583 --> 00:07:38,416
There's no reason you can't.
That's easy for you to say.

187
00:07:38,418 --> 00:07:40,051
You and Sheldon
already came up with

188
00:07:40,053 --> 00:07:41,719
your superfluid helium model.

189
00:07:41,721 --> 00:07:43,121
That's just research.
We're never gonna

190
00:07:43,123 --> 00:07:44,622
make any money from it.

191
00:07:44,624 --> 00:07:46,324
Forget helium.
The real superfluid

192
00:07:46,326 --> 00:07:49,093
is the fruit punch in this mug.

193
00:07:49,095 --> 00:07:51,496
Reminds me of my daddy's secret

194
00:07:51,498 --> 00:07:53,731
"Don't Tell Mama" juice.

195
00:07:55,802 --> 00:07:58,035
Uh, these are strong,
you should slow down.

196
00:07:58,037 --> 00:08:00,471
Oh. I'll just take one last sip.

197
00:08:06,582 --> 00:08:07,582
Ah.

198
00:08:17,888 --> 00:08:20,889
Okay, how about this
for an invention...

199
00:08:20,891 --> 00:08:24,159
slightly... bigger
cocktail umbrellas.

200
00:08:25,462 --> 00:08:27,028
How is that a new invention?

201
00:08:27,030 --> 00:08:29,431
I don't know, all Apple does
is change the size of things

202
00:08:29,433 --> 00:08:31,633
and we keep buying them.

203
00:08:31,635 --> 00:08:35,437
It's true. I like my giant iPad
and my little iPad

204
00:08:35,439 --> 00:08:38,907
almost as much
as my regular-sized iPad.

205
00:08:38,909 --> 00:08:41,142
This place is terrific.

206
00:08:41,144 --> 00:08:43,745
Why-why have
we never been here before?

207
00:08:43,747 --> 00:08:48,083
The same reason we don't do
a lot of fun stuff... you.

208
00:08:48,085 --> 00:08:50,185
That's some smart talk
from a guy

209
00:08:50,187 --> 00:08:52,654
who can't even keep
his face in focus.

210
00:08:55,258 --> 00:08:57,492
Where's the bathroom?

211
00:08:57,494 --> 00:08:58,660
Uh, it's in the corner.

212
00:08:58,662 --> 00:09:00,862
Excuse me.

213
00:09:02,299 --> 00:09:05,100
Hey, how you doin'?

214
00:09:07,137 --> 00:09:09,037
I hope the bathroom
is clearly marked.

215
00:09:09,039 --> 00:09:10,171
Doesn't matter.

216
00:09:10,173 --> 00:09:12,474
He's headed
for the kitchen anyway.

217
00:09:13,376 --> 00:09:14,509
Maybe that's an idea...

218
00:09:14,511 --> 00:09:17,078
guidance systems
for drunk people.

219
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:19,380
They have that.
It's called Uber.

220
00:09:19,382 --> 00:09:20,749
Hey.

221
00:09:20,751 --> 00:09:22,484
In your supercooled
helium experiments,

222
00:09:22,486 --> 00:09:24,953
did you create
quantum vortices?

223
00:09:24,955 --> 00:09:25,954
Yeah. Why?

224
00:09:25,956 --> 00:09:27,255
Well, if you made
a guidance system,

225
00:09:27,257 --> 00:09:29,691
couldn't you use those vortices
as a gyroscope?

226
00:09:29,693 --> 00:09:32,160
Wow. I've never thought
about that.

227
00:09:32,162 --> 00:09:33,762
And since
it's in a quantum state,

228
00:09:33,764 --> 00:09:35,563
it would maintain
an infinite persistence.

229
00:09:35,565 --> 00:09:38,199
Groundbreaking revelations,
tropical drinks.

230
00:09:38,201 --> 00:09:42,237
Tell me this isn't like the best
episode of Sex and the City.

231
00:09:44,274 --> 00:09:47,008
You may have actually
just come up with something.

232
00:09:47,010 --> 00:09:48,710
You think so?
I really do.

233
00:09:48,712 --> 00:09:51,713
You guys, the bathroom
here is amazing.

234
00:09:51,715 --> 00:09:54,349
There's people
cooking in it.

235
00:09:57,087 --> 00:09:58,586
Think about all the fun
things you get to do

236
00:09:58,588 --> 00:09:59,954
when you have a baby.
Yeah!

237
00:09:59,956 --> 00:10:03,191
Yeah, you get to buy toys
and little clothes.

238
00:10:03,193 --> 00:10:06,194
I kind of already do that
for Howie.

239
00:10:06,196 --> 00:10:08,096
And-and whenever you're hungry,

240
00:10:08,098 --> 00:10:12,200
you'll be in a minivan with
Cheerios all over the floor.

241
00:10:12,202 --> 00:10:15,069
Oh, and I just found a
new travel cup for Sheldon.

242
00:10:15,071 --> 00:10:17,205
It only lets out
three at a time.

243
00:10:18,308 --> 00:10:21,009
So, when did you guys
decide to get pregnant?

244
00:10:21,011 --> 00:10:23,778
Well, we didn't exactly decide.

245
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:25,046
We were talking about it,

246
00:10:25,048 --> 00:10:27,282
and then one night
we got a little reckless.

247
00:10:27,284 --> 00:10:29,284
Oh, tell us!
Yeah, tell us.

248
00:10:29,286 --> 00:10:30,518
No, I'm embarrassed.
Oh, come on,

249
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:32,287
we're all grown-ups.
We've all done it.

250
00:10:32,289 --> 00:10:35,323
Me! Me-me, too!
I'm a grown-up and I've done it!

251
00:10:37,727 --> 00:10:39,727
Fine.

252
00:10:39,729 --> 00:10:41,262
We were out one night,

253
00:10:41,264 --> 00:10:44,833
and things got
a little spontaneous.

254
00:10:44,835 --> 00:10:46,768
Oh, that sounds juicy.

255
00:10:46,770 --> 00:10:48,703
Well, Sheldon was going on
and on about time zones

256
00:10:48,705 --> 00:10:51,559
and railroad schedules,
and I went out...

257
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:53,943
Wait, I remember that.
Hang on.

258
00:10:53,944 --> 00:10:57,579
You did it
at our place?

259
00:10:57,581 --> 00:11:00,782
Kind of on Sheldon's bed.

260
00:11:00,784 --> 00:11:03,384
What?
No!

261
00:11:04,221 --> 00:11:06,187
I was headed to the bathroom,

262
00:11:06,189 --> 00:11:08,523
and I passed Howie
on his way out.

263
00:11:08,525 --> 00:11:12,393
Usually he says,
"Do not go in there,"

264
00:11:12,395 --> 00:11:17,332
but this time he said,
"Hey, let's go in here."

265
00:11:17,334 --> 00:11:18,867
How could you do that?
I'm sorry,

266
00:11:18,869 --> 00:11:21,102
but you know what it's like
when you're with your man

267
00:11:21,104 --> 00:11:22,770
and one thing leads to another.

268
00:11:22,772 --> 00:11:25,340
I do know what that's like.
I really do.

269
00:11:27,978 --> 00:11:29,544
I'm not seeing anyone

270
00:11:29,546 --> 00:11:31,646
using liquid helium
vortices like this.

271
00:11:31,648 --> 00:11:33,514
I'm not finding
anything either.

272
00:11:33,516 --> 00:11:34,749
That's a good sign.

273
00:11:34,751 --> 00:11:36,684
Oh, wait, I found something.

274
00:11:36,686 --> 00:11:38,052
Damn. What is it?

275
00:11:38,054 --> 00:11:40,922
This video.
The baby panda sneezes,

276
00:11:40,924 --> 00:11:43,892
and the mama panda
gets so scared.

277
00:11:47,330 --> 00:11:49,130
Can you focus
on what we're talking about?

278
00:11:49,132 --> 00:11:50,565
All right.

279
00:11:50,567 --> 00:11:53,101
Look, now,
this may be the rum talking,

280
00:11:53,103 --> 00:11:56,037
but as long as the unpinning
rate of the vortices

281
00:11:56,039 --> 00:11:58,506
is kept within 1.1 and 1.3,

282
00:11:58,508 --> 00:12:01,876
the Magnus force issue
should be negligible.

283
00:12:03,346 --> 00:12:07,115
Even drunk, he's still smarter
than all of us.

284
00:12:07,117 --> 00:12:09,050
And stronger.

285
00:12:09,052 --> 00:12:12,520
Yeah. Who wants to see me
beat up the bartender?

286
00:12:13,356 --> 00:12:15,156
I'd enjoy that.

287
00:12:15,158 --> 00:12:17,625
Nah, she's a good kid.

288
00:12:19,496 --> 00:12:22,163
If this is a viable thing,
we could get a patent

289
00:12:22,165 --> 00:12:25,233
and license it to companies
that make guidance systems.

290
00:12:25,235 --> 00:12:27,702
Look at that. You've known
you're gonna be a father

291
00:12:27,704 --> 00:12:30,371
for less than a day
and you're already stepping up.

292
00:12:30,373 --> 00:12:31,606
I'm telling you,
you got this.

293
00:12:31,608 --> 00:12:32,874
Maybe you're right.

294
00:12:32,876 --> 00:12:34,342
Of course he's right.

295
00:12:34,344 --> 00:12:38,112
You and I both know how hard it
is growing up without a father.

296
00:12:38,114 --> 00:12:40,014
That's why I'm confident
you're gonna be

297
00:12:40,016 --> 00:12:41,749
the best dad you can be.

298
00:12:42,585 --> 00:12:44,652
Thank you, Sheldon.

299
00:12:44,654 --> 00:12:45,954
You're welcome.

300
00:12:45,956 --> 00:12:47,555
And if he has
twins, we can do

301
00:12:47,557 --> 00:12:51,025
all kinds
of neat experiments on them.

302
00:12:53,830 --> 00:12:56,364
You guys can go in
if you want.

303
00:12:56,366 --> 00:12:57,665
No, we're a team.

304
00:12:57,667 --> 00:12:59,634
If you can't go in,
we're not going in.

305
00:13:00,470 --> 00:13:02,770
Then why are we drinking?

306
00:13:02,772 --> 00:13:05,506
Okay, it's not like she's got
the Christ child in there,

307
00:13:05,508 --> 00:13:07,442
all right?

308
00:13:08,878 --> 00:13:10,411
Oh. It's Leonard.

309
00:13:10,413 --> 00:13:12,714
He says Sheldon's drunk
and they're gonna do karaoke

310
00:13:12,716 --> 00:13:13,848
if we want to join them.

311
00:13:13,850 --> 00:13:15,783
That sounds fun.

312
00:13:15,785 --> 00:13:17,685
Oh, no.

313
00:13:17,687 --> 00:13:19,620
Sheldon's drunk
texting me.

314
00:13:19,622 --> 00:13:20,655
What's it say?

315
00:13:20,657 --> 00:13:23,391
"Would you like
to sing karaoke with us."

316
00:13:23,393 --> 00:13:24,826
How is that a drunk text?

317
00:13:24,828 --> 00:13:26,728
He used a period
instead of a question mark.

318
00:13:26,730 --> 00:13:29,197

Hey, guys. Congratulations!

340
00:14:12,475 --> 00:14:13,441
Thank you.

341
00:14:13,443 --> 00:14:16,110
Hi. How are you doing?

342
00:14:16,112 --> 00:14:17,712
Oh, wonderful.

343
00:14:17,714 --> 00:14:21,082
I'm being musically
encouraged to bust a move.

344
00:14:21,084 --> 00:14:24,752
If I knew what that meant,
I might just do it.

345
00:14:24,754 --> 00:14:26,421
I'm really glad
you're here.

346
00:14:26,423 --> 00:14:28,523
Can we talk?
Sure.

347
00:14:29,726 --> 00:14:31,759
So, you gonna get
up there later?

348
00:14:31,761 --> 00:14:33,594
A microphone,
a room

349
00:14:33,596 --> 00:14:35,897
full of inaccurate depictions
of Polynesian religion,

350
