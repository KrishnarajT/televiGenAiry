00:00:02,187 --> 00:00:04,981
Sheldon Cooper's
descent into madness...

2
00:00:04,997 --> 00:00:08,464
day two.

3
00:00:08,467 --> 00:00:09,999
It's 2:25 a.m.,

4
00:00:10,002 --> 00:00:13,937
and I feel the urge to urinate.

5
00:00:13,938 --> 00:00:17,239
My normal urination time
is 7:10 a.m.,

6
00:00:17,241 --> 00:00:20,177
but here I am,
in the middle of the night,

7
00:00:20,178 --> 00:00:22,345
struggling to keep my mind sharp

8
00:00:22,346 --> 00:00:26,148
and my pajamas dry.

9
00:00:26,151 --> 00:00:27,450
It's only a matter of time

10
00:00:27,453 --> 00:00:32,021
before my tenuous grasp
on reality fades.

11
00:00:32,024 --> 00:00:35,991
I suppose I should pee while
I still know what a toilet is.

12
00:00:50,442 --> 00:00:53,309
Since when do you hum songs?

13
00:00:53,311 --> 00:00:54,443
What are you talking
about?

14
00:00:54,445 --> 00:00:55,744
You were just humming.
Are you sure?

15
00:00:55,747 --> 00:00:58,714
Sometimes when my brain
really gets moving,

16
00:00:58,717 --> 00:01:01,284
it makes noise.

17
00:01:01,286 --> 00:01:03,586
How does your brain feel about
calculating the surface tension

18
00:01:03,588 --> 00:01:04,854
of the domain walls?

19
00:01:04,856 --> 00:01:07,157
Let's see.

20
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:11,461
Hey! I was humming.

21
00:01:11,463 --> 00:01:14,663
One point
for Hufflepuff.

22
00:01:17,603 --> 00:01:19,535
What song is that?

23
00:01:19,538 --> 00:01:22,372
Well... Hum it again.

24
00:01:24,276 --> 00:01:26,076
Is that the SpongeBob song?

25
00:01:26,077 --> 00:01:30,247
♪ Who lives

26
00:01:30,249 --> 00:01:31,647
Whatever. Can we just
get back to this?

27
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:33,015
I feel like I know
what song that is,

28
00:01:33,017 --> 00:01:35,552
but I can't put
my finger on it.

29

46
00:02:24,109 --> 00:02:26,308
Hello, yes, I was hoping
you could help me.

47
00:02:26,311 --> 00:02:30,880
What song is this?
♪ La, la, la, la, la, la, la. ♪

48
00:02:30,883 --> 00:02:32,282
You don't know?

49
00:02:32,284 --> 00:02:33,749
Well, how dare you
call yourselves

50
00:02:33,752 --> 00:02:37,052
a Rock and Roll Hall of Fame?

51
00:02:37,055 --> 00:02:39,856
My goodness. Do you sing along
to the greatest hits

52
00:02:39,857 --> 00:02:42,159
of Elvis Presley
with that mouth?

53
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,628
Well, they were no help at all.
Which is crazy,

54
00:02:44,629 --> 00:02:48,664
since rock and roll is all
about good customer service.

55
00:02:48,666 --> 00:02:50,700
Yeah. So you have a song
stuck in your head.

56
00:02:50,701 --> 00:02:51,967
It happens to everybody.

57
00:02:51,969 --> 00:02:54,037
Well, I'm not everybody.
I have an eidetic memory.

58
00:02:54,039 --> 00:02:56,238
I should be able to remember
what song this is,

59
00:02:56,241 --> 00:02:57,174
but I can't.

60
00:02:57,176 --> 00:02:59,041
Something's wrong with me.

61
00:02:59,044 --> 00:03:02,111
I told you if we were patient,
he'd figure it out for himself.

62
00:03:02,113 --> 00:03:04,848
Oh... I was always afraid
this day would come.

63
00:03:04,849 --> 00:03:08,451
This might be the first step
of my descent into madness,

64
00:03:08,454 --> 00:03:12,087
where I gradually test
the limits of public nudity.

65
00:03:12,925 --> 00:03:13,890
Public nudity?

66
00:03:13,891 --> 00:03:17,127
Eh, that just means
going barefoot.

67
00:03:24,937 --> 00:03:27,037
Hello?
Hi, Dave.

68
00:03:27,039 --> 00:03:28,337
Uh, it's Amy.

69
00:03:28,339 --> 00:03:30,940
Oh. How are you?
I'm fine. How are you?

70
00:03:30,943 --> 00:03:33,976
Terrific. And pleasantly
surprised to hear from you,

71
00:03:33,979 --> 00:03:36,512
given how I acted
on our last date.

72
00:03:36,515 --> 00:03:37,546
Yeah, well,

73
00:03:37,549 --> 00:03:38,981
we both made mistakes, you know.

74
00:03:38,984 --> 00:03:41,951
I took the last breadstick,
you gushed over my ex-boyfriend

75
00:03:41,954 --> 00:03:46,156
like he was Leonard Nimoy
and you were my ex-boyfriend.

76
00:03:46,158 --> 00:03:48,525
So, to what do I owe
the pleasure?

77
00:03:48,527 --> 00:03:50,460
Well, I was wondering

78
00:03:50,462 --> 00:03:53,195
if you'd like to get dinner
again sometime.

79
00:03:53,198 --> 00:03:54,830
Yes, please.

80
00:03:54,832 --> 00:03:57,700
Great.
Let me just check

81
00:03:57,702 --> 00:03:59,503
my schedule, he said,

82
00:03:59,504 --> 00:04:02,338
trying to seem like a man
with things on his schedule.

83
00:04:02,341 --> 00:04:04,640
How 'bout Saturday?

84
00:04:04,642 --> 00:04:06,009
Uh, hmm...

85
00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:07,510
Let me see. Uh, Friday,

86
00:04:07,512 --> 00:04:09,178
farmers' market with Jay Z.

87
00:04:09,181 --> 00:04:12,182
Sunday, piano shopping
with Elton John.

88
00:04:12,183 --> 00:04:13,849
Saturday works.

89
00:04:15,988 --> 00:04:19,488
Oh. Did you know,
at the United Nations,

90
00:04:19,491 --> 00:04:22,192
there's a Department
for Outer Space Affairs?

91
00:04:22,193 --> 00:04:23,793
Really? Why?

92
00:04:23,794 --> 00:04:25,529
They exist
in case we ever make contact

93
00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:26,929
with an alien civilization.

94
00:04:26,931 --> 00:04:30,467
Mm, boy, that's one of those
jobs that's boring, boring,

95
00:04:30,469 --> 00:04:32,269
boring, then, "Oh, God!

96
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:35,539
Where's the memo
with what we do now?"

97
00:04:36,575 --> 00:04:38,207
Oh, this is cool.

98
00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:40,577
So, a few weeks ago,
I set up a fan page

99
00:04:40,578 --> 00:04:43,313
on Facebook for our band and...
Wait a second.

100
00:04:43,315 --> 00:04:46,750
How could you do that
without consulting me?

101
00:04:46,751 --> 00:04:47,784
It's not a big deal.

102
00:04:47,786 --> 00:04:49,051
It just took, like,
five minutes to set up.

103
00:04:49,053 --> 00:04:50,654
That's not the point.

104
00:04:50,655 --> 00:04:53,490
When we created
Footprints on the Moon,

105
00:04:53,491 --> 00:04:57,193
we agreed that every band
decision would be mutual.

106
00:04:57,195 --> 00:04:59,496
Now you're just trying to
take over the whole thing.

107
00:04:59,498 --> 00:05:02,933
You know,
maybe I should go solo.

108
00:05:02,935 --> 00:05:04,967
But someone joined
our page.

109
00:05:04,969 --> 00:05:06,936
We have an actual fan.

110
00:05:06,938 --> 00:05:08,837
All right.

111
00:05:08,839 --> 00:05:11,174
This thing's bigger than you
and me— band's back together.

112
00:05:13,311 --> 00:05:14,743
So, listen to what he wrote.

113
00:05:14,746 --> 00:05:17,546
Uh, "I saw you play
at the comic book store.

114
00:05:17,549 --> 00:05:18,881
You guys rock."

115
00:05:18,883 --> 00:05:21,183
And then there's
a animated smiley face

116
00:05:21,186 --> 00:05:23,385
raising the roof like this...

117
00:05:25,323 --> 00:05:26,890
We did raise the roof
that night.

118
00:05:26,892 --> 00:05:28,525
Yeah, we totally did.
Why do rock stars

119
00:05:28,527 --> 00:05:31,995

and do something
else for a while?

128
00:05:57,688 --> 00:06:00,823
There was a project I've
been thinking about starting.

129
00:06:00,825 --> 00:06:02,058
Okay, great. What is it?

130
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:04,226
I'll show you.

131
00:06:07,099 --> 00:06:09,832
Dear Crazy Future Sheldon,

132
00:06:09,835 --> 00:06:12,168
you were driven mad
by an earworm.

133
00:06:12,169 --> 00:06:14,537
Your mind,
once your most trusted asset,

134
00:06:14,539 --> 00:06:17,506
is now a sack of parrots
and monkeys.

135
00:06:17,508 --> 00:06:19,109
So...

136
00:06:19,111 --> 00:06:20,943
I'm going to tell you
everything you need to know.

137
00:06:20,945 --> 00:06:23,246
Uh, first, music is dangerous.

138
00:06:23,248 --> 00:06:26,482
The movie Footloose tried to
warn us, but we wouldn't listen.

139
00:06:26,484 --> 00:06:29,952
Oh, wait.
♪ Everybody cut footloo... ♪

140
00:06:29,955 --> 00:06:31,453
Nope.

141
00:06:31,455 --> 00:06:35,791
I'll pay $1,000 to watch you
cut footloose.

142
00:06:36,662 --> 00:06:38,827
This is Penny.

143
00:06:39,664 --> 00:06:42,431
She is your friend.

144
00:06:42,433 --> 00:06:44,900
If she offers you food,
it's safe to take it.

145
00:06:44,902 --> 00:06:47,703
You probably
paid for it, anyway.

146
00:06:49,875 --> 00:06:51,907
So, you're really going out
with Dave again?

147
00:06:51,909 --> 00:06:53,142
Why not?

148
00:06:53,145 --> 00:06:54,476
He's actually a very nice guy.

149
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:56,346
But he spent an entire date

150
00:06:56,347 --> 00:06:58,681
talking about how much
he loves Sheldon.

151
00:06:58,683 --> 00:07:00,816
That's nothing Sheldon
hasn't done before.

152
00:07:02,787 --> 00:07:04,553
Dave's just a big
fan of his work.

153
00:07:04,556 --> 00:07:07,323
Besides, he said he
wouldn't bring it up again.

154
00:07:07,325 --> 00:07:09,558
Okay. So where's he taking you?

155
00:07:09,561 --> 00:07:12,628
Oh, he's coming here.
I'm actually making dinner.

156
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:14,698
Oh. That's a big step.

157
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:16,032
It is?

158
00:07:16,034 --> 00:07:18,467
Yeah. You're inviting him
into your home.

159
00:07:18,469 --> 00:07:19,769
It's intimate.

160
00:07:19,770 --> 00:07:22,705
It's where your underpants live.

161
00:07:22,707 --> 00:07:25,041
You know what? Good.

162
00:07:25,043 --> 00:07:28,577
I tried to get back together
with Sheldon; he shot me down;

163
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:29,979
Dave likes me.

164
00:07:29,981 --> 00:07:33,116
Maybe intimate
is what I need.

165
00:07:33,118 --> 00:07:34,416
You sure?

166
00:07:34,419 --> 00:07:37,152
You've never really been
with a man.

167
00:07:37,154 --> 00:07:41,390
Do you really want to start
with one that's six-foot-seven?

168
00:07:41,392 --> 00:07:43,493
Why not?

169
00:07:43,495 --> 00:07:46,796
'Cause it's like taking
your driver's test in a bus.

170
00:07:50,501 --> 00:07:53,870
Maybe we should post a comment
back to our fan and thank him.

171
00:07:53,871 --> 00:07:55,337
What should we write?

172
00:07:55,339 --> 00:07:58,073
How 'bout, uh...
Oh, how 'bout,

173
00:07:58,075 --> 00:07:59,875
"We might be
Footprints on the Moon,

174
00:07:59,878 --> 00:08:04,447
but your kind words sent
us over the moon."

175
00:08:04,448 --> 00:08:08,017
Someday you're gonna make
an amazing grandma.

176
00:08:08,019 --> 00:08:09,652
What do you
want to write?

177
00:08:09,654 --> 00:08:12,688
Something bad-ass,
you know, like...

178
00:08:12,690 --> 00:08:14,724
"Thanks for diggin' our vibe.

179
00:08:14,726 --> 00:08:16,493
"We'll keep rockin'

180
00:08:16,495 --> 00:08:19,828
if you keep rollin'."

181
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:21,330
Dude, if I was wearing a bra,

182
00:08:21,332 --> 00:08:24,133
I'd throw it at
your head right now.

183
00:08:24,135 --> 00:08:26,902
I'll keep rockin'.
You don't do that.

184
00:08:28,907 --> 00:08:31,140
Okay. I posted it.

185
00:08:31,142 --> 00:08:32,641
So, who is this guy?

186
00:08:32,644 --> 00:08:36,279
Let's see.
Uh, his name is Trent Monaco.

187
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:38,448
Cool name.
Yeah.

188
00:08:38,449 --> 00:08:41,083
He's 24. He's a deejay.

189
00:08:41,086 --> 00:08:43,285
He brews his own beer.
He's got

190
00:08:43,288 --> 00:08:47,055
awesome tattoos. Dude, he's
got a hot girlfriend, too.

191
00:08:47,058 --> 00:08:51,260
Damn. I don't know if he's
our biggest fan or I'm his.

192
00:08:52,863 --> 00:08:55,030
Hey, Trent just liked
our comment.

193
00:08:55,033 --> 00:08:57,199
He is so cool!

194
00:08:57,202 --> 00:08:58,534
No hard feelings,

195
00:08:58,536 --> 00:09:01,136
but I'm throwing my
hypothetical bra at him.

196
00:09:13,418 --> 00:09:16,718
Oh, my God, he won't stop.

197
00:09:16,721 --> 00:09:20,390
How does he keep coming up
with new ways to be annoying?

198
00:09:20,391 --> 00:09:23,793
Nobody knows.
That's why he's number one.

199
00:09:25,096 --> 00:09:27,197
Can you please go talk
to him?

200
00:09:27,198 --> 00:09:30,033
Come on. I take care of him all
day long. You do it for once.

201
00:09:30,034 --> 00:09:33,101
Once? Who got the gum
out of his hair?

202
00:09:33,103 --> 00:09:36,805
What do you want, a medal?
It was your gum.

203
00:09:36,808 --> 00:09:39,808
Fine.

204
00:09:39,811 --> 00:09:40,943
I love you.

205
00:09:40,946 --> 00:09:42,312
Who cares?

206
00:09:45,082 --> 00:09:47,049
What are you
doing in my room? I...

207
00:09:47,052 --> 00:09:49,919
Stop it! That's mine!

208
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:52,822
Why are you so strong?

209
00:09:55,459 --> 00:09:57,559
Problem solved.

210
00:10:08,505 --> 00:10:10,340
Oh, yeah,
he got a tuba.

211
00:10:19,712 --> 00:10:23,713
Dear Crazy Future Sheldon...

212
00:10:23,716 --> 00:10:25,716
this is a thermostat.

213
00:10:25,717 --> 00:10:28,952
It controls the temperature
of the apartment.

214
00:10:29,988 --> 00:10:32,689
The ideal setting is 72 degrees.

215
00:10:32,692 --> 00:10:35,726
If you find this too cold,
then put on a jacket.

216
00:10:35,727 --> 00:10:39,563
A straitjacket, 'cause 72's
the best and you're crazy.

217
00:10:40,433 --> 00:10:42,598
Now... this...

218
00:10:42,601 --> 00:10:44,467
is your spot.

219
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:46,703
You're very protective of it.

220
00:10:46,706 --> 00:10:48,672
When anyone else tries
to sit here,

221
00:10:48,674 --> 00:10:50,606
you berate them relentlessly.

222
00:10:50,609 --> 00:10:54,311
It sounds mean, but
somehow you make it adorable.

223
00:10:56,048 --> 00:10:58,948
People are also delighted
by your love of pranks.

224
00:11:00,086 --> 00:11:02,586
For example, Leonard has no idea

225
00:11:02,587 --> 00:11:04,053
what I did to his coffee.

226
00:11:06,192 --> 00:11:08,324
It wasn't "replace it
with Folger's crystals,"

227
00:11:08,327 --> 00:11:10,361
I'll tell you that much.

228
00:11:10,362 --> 00:11:12,996
Hey, can we please
get back to work?

229
00:11:12,999 --> 00:11:14,698
This is Leonard.

230
00:11:14,699 --> 00:11:16,533
He's your best friend
in the world.

231
00:11:16,534 --> 00:11:18,936
All right, just stop.
This is ridiculous.

232
00:11:20,505 --> 00:11:23,006
Sometimes he gets cranky,

233
00:11:23,009 --> 00:11:25,842
but you can trust him
with your life.

234
00:11:25,845 --> 00:11:29,212
And he does more things for you
than I can even begin to list.

235
00:11:29,215 --> 00:11:32,415
Thank you.

236
00:11:32,418 --> 00:11:34,650
Oh, no, he's drinking it.

237
00:11:38,890 --> 00:11:40,090
Look at this.

238
00:11:40,092 --> 00:11:42,925
Trent is rebuilding
a vintage motorcycle.

239
00:11:42,928 --> 00:11:45,661
Hmm.
That is so cool!

240
00:11:45,664 --> 00:11:47,630
Old broken things
are so much better

241
00:11:47,632 --> 00:11:50,734
than new things that work.

242
00:11:50,736 --> 00:11:52,202
Who's Trent?

243
00:11:52,203 --> 00:11:53,437
Oh, he's our fan.

244
00:11:53,438 --> 00:11:55,539
- Fan of what?
- Uh...

245
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:59,043
Did you forget?
We're in a band.

246
00:11:59,044 --> 00:12:01,779
You mean because you played one
time in the comic book store?

247
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:05,716
And at the children's hospital
until they asked us to leave.

248
00:12:05,717 --> 00:12:07,183
Hey,

249
00:12:07,185 --> 00:12:10,220
dude, Trent just checked in at
the coffee shop on Fair Oaks.

250
00:12:10,222 --> 00:12:13,189
Really? You want to go
down there and meet him?

251
00:12:13,192 --> 00:12:15,458
Are you stalking him?
That's creepy.

252
00:12:15,461 --> 00:12:16,827
It's not creepy.

253
00:12:16,828 --> 00:12:19,163
I built a Footprints on the Moon
fan page, Trent joined it.

254
00:12:19,164 --> 00:12:21,198
After that, all I did was
check out his profile,

255
00:12:21,199 --> 00:12:22,698
go back in the archive
of his feed

256
00:12:22,701 --> 00:12:24,134
until I found
his Twitter handle.

257
00:12:24,135 --> 00:12:26,403
From there, it was easy to find
him on Instagram, Snapchat

258
00:12:26,404 --> 00:12:27,938
and pretty much track
his every movement.

259
00:12:27,939 --> 00:12:31,007
So if you think that's creepy,
you married the wrong guy.

260
00:12:31,843 --> 00:12:33,843
Maybe I should marry Trent.

261
00:12:33,846 --> 00:12:37,047
Yeah, like she
could get Trent.

262
00:12:39,885 --> 00:12:41,250
This is delicious.

263
00:12:41,252 --> 00:12:42,486
Thank you.

264
00:12:42,487 --> 00:12:45,088
Been a long time since
I had a home-cooked meal.

265
00:12:45,091 --> 00:12:47,290
When you were married,
did your wife cook?

266
00:12:47,293 --> 00:12:48,958
Not at first, no.

267
00:12:48,961 --> 00:12:51,562
But when she began cheating
on me with a French chef,

268
00:12:51,563 --> 00:12:53,863
she became quite the wiz
in t kitchen.

269
00:12:53,866 --> 00:12:55,432
So, a little silver lining.

270
00:12:55,433 --> 00:12:56,799
I suppose.

271
00:12:56,802 --> 00:12:59,803
Yeah. Nothing takes the sting
out of a shattered life

272
00:12:59,804 --> 00:13:03,307
like a properly-seasoned
bowl of onion soup.

273
00:13:03,308 --> 00:13:05,943
How long have you,
uh, lived here?

274
00:13:05,944 --> 00:13:07,944
About five years.

275
00:13:07,947 --> 00:13:10,246
I'm actually thinking
of moving to a better place

276
00:13:10,249 --> 00:13:12,616
now that I don't need
to be so close to...

277
00:13:12,617 --> 00:13:14,117
Well, you know.

278
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:16,019
I do. The brilliant physicist

279
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:19,289
that I now know lives
in the area, not that I care.

280
00:13:19,290 --> 00:13:21,924
Yeah. Anyway, he doesn't drive,

281
00:13:21,927 --> 00:13:24,428
so, I pretty much had
to take him everywhere.

282
00:13:24,429 --> 00:13:26,196
Had to or got to?

283
00:13:26,198 --> 00:13:27,363
Sorry.

284
00:13:27,366 --> 00:13:29,866
My fault. I brought him up.
Yeah.

285
00:13:29,869 --> 00:13:31,201
Well, let's change the subject.

286
00:13:31,202 --> 00:13:33,169
No more mentions
of you-know-who.

287
00:13:33,172 --> 00:13:34,904
That's a cool train.

288
00:13:34,906 --> 00:13:37,073
Where did you get that?

289
00:13:38,177 --> 00:13:41,077
♪ Bah, bah, bum-bum,
bah, bum, bum. ♪

290
00:13:51,289 --> 00:13:52,823
This song

291
00:13:52,824 --> 00:13:54,024
is never going to stop.

292
00:13:54,025 --> 00:13:55,558
Have you ever dealt
with something

293
00:13:55,561 --> 00:13:58,161
so relentlessly irritating?

294
00:13:59,030 --> 00:14:02,598
That's a trick
question, right?

295
00:14:02,601 --> 00:14:04,134
Well, I shouldn't
be surprised.

296
00:14:04,135 --> 00:14:05,635
There's a rich history of

297
00:14:05,638 --> 00:14:07,303
brilliant minds
descending into madness.

298
00:14:07,305 --> 00:14:08,804
Come on, Sheldon.

299
00:14:08,807 --> 00:14:11,507
There are plenty of smart people
who don't have mental problems.

300
00:14:11,510 --> 00:14:12,643
Yup, she's right.

301
00:14:12,645 --> 00:14:14,611
For every Newton who had
a psychological issue,

302
00:14:14,612 --> 00:14:16,513
there's an Edison
who was just a jerk.

303
00:14:16,515 --> 00:14:18,915
That could
totally be you.

304
00:14:18,918 --> 00:14:22,785
Empedocles thought he was a god
and jumped into a volcano.

305
00:14:22,788 --> 00:14:24,353
And Pythagoras had

306
00:14:24,356 --> 00:14:26,023
an irrational fear of beans.

307
00:14:26,025 --> 00:14:28,391
Tesla fell madly in love
with a pigeon

308
00:14:28,394 --> 00:14:31,528
who he claimed loved him back.

309
00:14:31,529 --> 00:14:34,664
Maybe he just had bread
in his pocket.

310
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,934
The list extends
outside of science.

311
00:14:37,937 --> 00:14:40,904
Painters like Van Gogh
and Pollock,

312
00:14:40,905 --> 00:14:42,773
chess champion Bobby Fischer,

313
00:14:42,775 --> 00:14:45,741
Brian Wilson of the Beach Boy...

00:14:49,215 --> 00:14:52,149

316
00:14:56,654 --> 00:14:58,188
I remember the song!

317
00:14:58,189 --> 00:15:00,057
It's called
"Darlin'" by the Beach Boys!

318
00:15:00,058 --> 00:15:01,558
Oh, thank goodness!

319
00:15:01,559 --> 00:15:03,961
I'm not crazy!

320
00:15:03,962 --> 00:15:06,630
I don't have
to take a pigeon as my bride!

321
00:15:08,933 --> 00:15:12,202
There goes our shot at
him living on the roof.

322
00:15:14,405 --> 00:15:17,607
So, all right, there he is.

323
00:15:18,443 --> 00:15:20,611
So, should we
introduce ourselves?

324
00:15:20,612 --> 00:15:23,179
No! Let him spot us.

325
00:15:23,182 --> 00:15:24,715
I wonder

326
00:15:24,717 --> 00:15:27,183
if he's listening
to our music right now.

327
00:15:27,186 --> 00:15:28,485
Could you imagine?

328
00:15:28,486 --> 00:15:30,419
What a cool way
for us to meet.

329
00:15:30,422 --> 00:15:33,890
He's playing our song and
looks up, and there we are—

330
00:15:33,891 --> 00:15:38,095
his favorite two-piece acoustic
sci-fi novelty rock band.

331
00:15:38,097 --> 00:15:39,563
And he's, all, like,

332
00:15:39,564 --> 00:15:42,732
"Aren't you the guys from
Footprints on the Moo...?"

333
00:15:42,735 --> 00:15:44,601
Ooh, what is he doing?

334
00:15:47,972 --> 00:15:49,238
I can't watch.

335
00:15:49,241 --> 00:15:50,841
I-I-It's okay.

336
00:15:50,842 --> 00:15:52,708
Oh, it's okay.
He's done.

337
00:15:52,711 --> 00:15:54,910
Why is he looking at it?

338
00:15:55,981 --> 00:15:59,348
Eh, no, he's not going
to eat it, is he?

339
00:15:59,351 --> 00:16:00,983
Come on, Trent,
you're better than...

340
00:16:05,624 --> 00:16:08,324
Let's just go.

341
00:16:08,327 --> 00:16:11,361
Hey, aren't you
the guys...?

342
00:16:11,362 --> 00:16:14,430
Nope!
Never heard of 'em!

00:16:19,972 --> 00:16:21,871
I wonder why it was
this particular song

346
00:16:21,874 --> 00:16:23,406
that was stuck
in my head.

347
00:16:23,409 --> 00:16:25,107
I don't know.
It's pretty catchy.

348
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:26,709
Do you even like the Beach Boys?

349
00:16:26,712 --> 00:16:28,678
They have "beach"
right in the name.

350
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:31,048
What do you think?

351
00:16:31,049 --> 00:16:33,382
Well, now that you can focus
again, what do you say

352
00:16:33,385 --> 00:16:35,318
we get back to surface tension
of domain walls?

353
00:16:35,321 --> 00:16:37,987
Of course. I'm already
seeing a more efficient way

354
00:16:37,990 --> 00:16:40,323
of taming the ultravi...

355
00:16:40,326 --> 00:16:42,759
I know why
the song was in my head.

356
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:45,328
Why?
It's about Amy.

357
00:16:45,331 --> 00:16:47,698
Okay, look, I know
Amy's like an old lady,

358
00:16:47,699 --> 00:16:49,866
but she's not old enough
to have a song

359
00:16:49,867 --> 00:16:51,967
from the '60s written about her.

360
00:16:51,970 --> 00:16:54,004
It's about
how she made my life better.

361
00:16:54,005 --> 00:16:55,371
Consider the lyrics.

362
00:16:55,374 --> 00:16:57,540
"I was living like half a man.

363
00:16:57,543 --> 00:17:00,010
"Then I couldn't love,
but now I can.

364
00:17:00,011 --> 00:17:01,211
"More soul than

365
00:17:01,212 --> 00:17:02,212
"I ever had.

366
00:17:02,213 --> 00:17:04,781
I love the way
you soften my life."

367
00:17:04,783 --> 00:17:07,717
Well, she did soften your life,
didn't she?

368
00:17:07,719 --> 00:17:09,085
Yes!

369
00:17:09,088 --> 00:17:11,655
She's like
the dryer sheets of my heart!

370
00:17:14,059 --> 00:17:15,257
I have to go.

371
00:17:17,463 --> 00:17:19,396
Aw.

372
00:17:19,398 --> 00:17:22,032
Am I like the dryer
sheets of your heart?

373
00:17:24,268 --> 00:17:26,703
Better. You're the
lint trap of my love.

374
00:17:26,705 --> 00:17:28,705
Aw.

375
00:17:37,216 --> 00:17:38,881
That's an interesting
tie clip.

376
00:17:38,883 --> 00:17:40,050
Oh, thanks.

377
00:17:40,052 --> 00:17:41,817
It's, uh, Avogadro's constant.

378
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:44,720
It's useful for calculating the
number of atoms in a substance,

379
00:17:44,723 --> 00:17:48,624
or causing regret
in anyone who asks about it.

380
00:17:48,627 --> 00:17:50,127
Oh, I...

381
00:17:50,129 --> 00:17:52,795
I think it's neat.

382
00:17:52,797 --> 00:17:54,598
Oh!
Sorry. Sorry.

383
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:56,565
No one's ever liked
the tie clip before,

384
00:17:56,567 --> 00:17:59,402
so I just lost
all control. I...

385
00:17:59,405 --> 00:18:02,005
No, it... it's okay,
and we are on a date.

386
00:18:02,006 --> 00:18:04,440
I'm... I'm just
a little nervous.

387
00:18:04,442 --> 00:18:07,576
Well, no need
to be nervous with me.

388
00:18:07,579 --> 00:18:10,613
I'm just a harmless giant
from a foreign land.

389
00:18:13,552 --> 00:18:15,785
You know, I'm just
being silly. I...

390
00:18:15,787 --> 00:18:18,522
I don't know what
I'm waiting for.

391
00:18:21,192 --> 00:18:22,092
Amy?

392
00:18:22,093 --> 00:18:23,659
Amy.

393
00:18:23,661 --> 00:18:24,928
Amy?

394
00:18:25,997 --> 00:18:28,031
That's Sheldon.

395
00:18:28,033 --> 00:18:30,132
You're kidding!
How's my hair?

396
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:38,341
Sheldon, this-this isn't
a good time.

397
00:18:38,342 --> 00:18:39,909
I don't care.

398
00:18:39,911 --> 00:18:42,478
Amy, there was a song I
couldn't get out of my head.

399
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:45,681
Eventually, I realized
the song was about you,

400
00:18:45,684 --> 00:18:50,387
and like that earworm, I can't
get you out of my heart.

401
00:18:50,389 --> 00:18:53,156
So, what I'm trying to say is,

402
00:18:53,158 --> 00:18:56,226
you're my heartworm.

403
00:18:57,396 --> 00:19:01,765
The metaphorical kind, not-not
the poodle-killing kind.

404
00:19:01,766 --> 00:19:03,967
W-W-W-What?

405
00:19:03,968 --> 00:19:06,035
If I may...

406
00:19:06,037 --> 00:19:08,170
I believe
what he's saying,

407
00:19:08,172 --> 00:19:09,939
in a charming
and delightful way,

408
00:19:09,941 --> 00:19:11,941
is that he loves you
and wants you back.

409
00:19:11,944 --> 00:19:13,476
Dave Gibbs,
huge fan of your work.

410
00:19:13,478 --> 00:19:15,312
Oh.
Don't mind me.

411
00:19:18,516 --> 00:19:21,650
I'm-I'm sorry; I didn't
realize you were on a date.

412
00:19:21,652 --> 00:19:24,387
No, it-it... it's okay.
Keep going?

413
00:19:24,389 --> 00:19:27,023
Amy, if you want to be
my girlfriend again,

414
00:19:27,025 --> 00:19:29,391
I really want to
be your boyfriend.

415
00:19:29,393 --> 00:19:32,161
I really want that, too.

416
00:19:32,163 --> 00:19:35,832
Good. Because I love you.

417
00:19:36,701 --> 00:19:39,803
I love you, too.

418
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:44,006
Kiss her,
you brilliant fool!

419
00:19:58,055 --> 00:20:00,457
Well...

420
00:20:00,458 --> 00:20:02,926
I'll let you get
back to your date.

421
00:20:02,928 --> 00:20:05,128
Get back here!

422
00:20:05,130 --> 00:20:07,964
♪ Oh, oh, oh, darlin' ♪

423
00:20:07,966 --> 00:20:11,267
♪ I dream about you often,
my pretty darlin' ♪

424
00:20:11,269 --> 00:20:13,836
♪ I love the way
you soften my... ♪

425
00:20:29,845 --> 00:20:31,378
Okay, then.

426
00:20:33,115 --> 00:20:35,682
I'll, uh, see myself out.

427
00:20:36,752 --> 00:20:38,319
Amy, thank you for dinner.

428
00:20:39,755 --> 00:20:42,723
Dr. Cooper, pleasure
to meet you, sir.

429
00:20:44,526 --> 00:20:47,527
Uh, if perhaps sometime
you have a spare moment,

430
00:20:47,530 --> 00:20:50,163
I'd, uh, love-love
to discuss physics,

431
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:52,533
or "shoot the breeze,"
as you Yanks say.

432
00:20:58,244 --> 00:21:00,372
Ah. What a lovely evening.

433
