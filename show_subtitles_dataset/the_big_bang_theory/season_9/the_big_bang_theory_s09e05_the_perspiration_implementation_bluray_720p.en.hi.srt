1
00:00:02,483 --> 00:00:04,817
Hey, ready for lunch?
Oh, one sec.

2
00:00:04,819 --> 00:00:08,253
Is that the prototype drive
system for the high-G rover?

3
00:00:08,256 --> 00:00:10,622
No, Bernadette
got me a Fitbit

4
00:00:10,625 --> 00:00:13,660
so she can track
how much I'm exercising.

5
00:00:14,994 --> 00:00:18,264
That'll teach her to care
about your health.

6
00:00:18,266 --> 00:00:22,034
I can't wait to see the look
on her face when I die young.

7
00:00:23,136 --> 00:00:24,537
When was the last actual
exercise you got?

8
00:00:24,538 --> 00:00:25,904
The other day, when

9
00:00:25,906 --> 00:00:29,342
she tried to put that Fitbit
on me and I ran away from her.

10
00:00:30,209 --> 00:00:31,810
According to a recent study,

11
00:00:31,813 --> 00:00:34,579
simply thinking about exercise,
even while sitting still,

12
00:00:34,581 --> 00:00:35,947
can have physical benefits.

13
00:00:35,950 --> 00:00:38,551
For all you know,
I could be exercising right now.

14
00:00:38,553 --> 00:00:41,453
Are you?
Eh, I'll do it tomorrow.

15
00:00:42,355 --> 00:00:43,655
It wouldn't be the worst thing

16
00:00:43,657 --> 00:00:44,824
if we were more active.

17
00:00:44,825 --> 00:00:47,225
Oh. You make
an excellent point.

18
00:00:50,396 --> 00:00:53,099
Ooh, I think

== sync, corrected by elderman ==
@elder_man

29
00:01:23,084 --> 00:01:25,316
Look at all these activities
the university has.

30
00:01:25,316 --> 00:01:28,350
Rock climbing club,
archery, flag football.

31
00:01:28,352 --> 00:01:31,688
Had me at flag,
lost me at football.

32
00:01:31,690 --> 00:01:34,323
Yeah, I think it's great you
guys want to get more exercise,

33
00:01:34,326 --> 00:01:37,260
but do you really think sports
is the right choice for you?

34
00:01:37,261 --> 00:01:39,227
What are you saying?
We're not coordinated enough

35
00:01:39,230 --> 00:01:40,328
to play sports?

36
00:01:40,331 --> 00:01:42,731
Okay, Leonard, sweetheart,

37
00:01:42,733 --> 00:01:46,035
you twisted your ankle
playing Scrabble.

38
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:48,870
I got a triple-word score

39
00:01:48,873 --> 00:01:50,540
with a double letter "Q."
If that's not a time

40
00:01:50,541 --> 00:01:53,441
to bust out the Scrabble dance,
what's the point of having one?

41
00:01:55,344 --> 00:01:59,180
Hey, Barry Kripke
started a fencing club.

42
00:01:59,183 --> 00:02:03,151
Interesting. Sword fighting does
hold a certain elegant appeal.

43
00:02:03,153 --> 00:02:04,987
And I would imagine
it meets many

44
00:02:04,989 --> 00:02:07,623
of our personal criteria
for a sport.

45
00:02:07,625 --> 00:02:09,958
It's indoors, so no sunscreen.

46
00:02:10,626 --> 00:02:11,626
No throwing, no catching,

47
00:02:11,629 --> 00:02:13,429
no running.

48
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:16,398
No gym shorts
that can be yanked down.

49
00:02:17,566 --> 00:02:18,768
Or worse, up.

50
00:02:18,769 --> 00:02:20,569
Preach.

51
00:02:20,571 --> 00:02:21,904
And as
an added bonus,

52
00:02:21,905 --> 00:02:23,638
the word "touché" comes
from fencing.

53
00:02:23,641 --> 00:02:25,673
It would be our only opportunity
to use it

54
00:02:25,676 --> 00:02:28,410
in a non-metaphorical sense.

55
00:02:28,411 --> 00:02:30,578
What about a game of tag
on a French schoolyard?

56
00:02:30,581 --> 00:02:32,481
Ah, touché.

57
00:02:35,218 --> 00:02:36,484
Thanks for coming by.

58
00:02:36,487 --> 00:02:38,186
Sure. So how can we help?

59
00:02:38,189 --> 00:02:40,356
Well, I know
more women are

60
00:02:40,357 --> 00:02:42,156
buying comics than ever,
but for some reason,

61
00:02:42,159 --> 00:02:44,025
I-I can't get
'em in here.

62
00:02:44,028 --> 00:02:46,060
All right, well,
what have you tried so far?

63
00:02:46,063 --> 00:02:49,665
Uh, I've-I've been stocking
more female-oriented titles.

64
00:02:49,667 --> 00:02:52,934
Uh, in the bathroom, I folded
the end of the toilet paper

65
00:02:52,936 --> 00:02:54,203
into a triangle.

66
00:02:54,204 --> 00:02:55,536
And,
uh,

67
00:02:55,538 --> 00:02:57,405
you are now sitting
in the official

68
00:02:57,407 --> 00:02:59,641
breastfeeding area.

69
00:03:01,911 --> 00:03:04,980
Really? In a comic book store?
Oh,

70
00:03:04,982 --> 00:03:07,249
don't worry. I-I've got
a camera right up here,

71
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:09,817
so I could watch
from the counter

72
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:13,321
and make sure guys
aren't being pervs.

73
00:03:17,793 --> 00:03:18,927
Anyway,

74
00:03:18,929 --> 00:03:20,761
so what do I got to do to-to

75
00:03:20,763 --> 00:03:21,996
get you in
the door?

76
00:03:21,999 --> 00:03:23,732
Well, for starters,

77
00:03:23,733 --> 00:03:26,034
you might want to rethink
some of this artwork.

78
00:03:26,035 --> 00:03:30,405
I mean, this woman's
actually on a leash like a dog.

79
00:03:30,406 --> 00:03:33,208
Well, you don't know
the backstory.

80
00:03:33,209 --> 00:03:36,278
Maybe she kept jumping up
on the couch.

81
00:03:49,225 --> 00:03:51,225
I feel cool.

82
00:03:51,227 --> 00:03:54,728
Like Puss in Boots.

83
00:03:54,731 --> 00:03:57,549
I always wanted to be
a swashbuckler when I was a kid.

84
00:03:57,573 --> 00:03:58,267
Technically,

85
00:03:58,268 --> 00:04:00,434
"swashbuckler" is a combination
of two terms.

86
00:04:00,436 --> 00:04:03,036
"Swash" referring to the sound
of the sword.

87
00:04:03,038 --> 00:04:05,072
Swash.

88
00:04:06,007 --> 00:04:07,441
And
then

89
00:04:07,444 --> 00:04:10,611
"buckler" meaning a small
shield, which you don't have.

90
00:04:10,613 --> 00:04:12,213
We can still be swashers.
Hmm.

91
00:04:12,214 --> 00:04:14,214
Well said, Puss.

92
00:04:15,516 --> 00:04:19,854
Gentlemen, welcome
to the fencing club.

93
00:04:19,855 --> 00:04:23,691
Before we start, I just want to
warn you, fencing isn't a joke.

94
00:04:23,693 --> 00:04:25,492
I hope you're not here because
you think it's going to be

95
00:04:25,494 --> 00:04:27,427
like Star Wars.

96
00:04:27,429 --> 00:04:28,328
That's not why we're here.

97
00:04:28,331 --> 00:04:29,530
Yeah, I'm here
because I think

98
00:04:29,532 --> 00:04:31,364
it's gonna be like
Game of Thrones.

99
00:04:31,367 --> 00:04:33,734
And maybe
a little Princess Bride.

100
00:04:33,736 --> 00:04:35,535
Ooh, ooh! I forgot
about Princess Bride!

101
00:04:35,537 --> 00:04:38,071
That's my answer!

102
00:04:38,073 --> 00:04:42,309
Well, sorry to disappoint you,
but fencing is a serious sport.

103
00:04:42,311 --> 00:04:43,343
If you're not willing
to put in the effort,

104
00:04:43,345 --> 00:04:45,446
you might as well just leave
now.

105
00:04:45,448 --> 00:04:47,681
We're not afraid of physical activity.
Yeah.

106
00:04:47,682 --> 00:04:50,283
I already ran 18 miles today.

107
00:04:51,386 --> 00:04:53,987
All right. Let's begin
with some fundamentals.

108
00:04:53,989 --> 00:04:56,323
This is the en
garde position.

109
00:04:56,324 --> 00:04:59,292
Feet are in an "L."
Heels in a straight line.

110
00:04:59,295 --> 00:05:00,261
Elbow is
about a fist

111
00:05:00,263 --> 00:05:01,862
from the rib cage.

112
00:05:01,864 --> 00:05:04,898
Notice my dominant
leg faces forward.

113
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:05,932
Oh, dear.

114
00:05:05,934 --> 00:05:07,234
What's wrong, Cooper?

115
00:05:07,235 --> 00:05:10,638
Well, I'm not sure
I have a dominant leg.

116
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:12,539
They're both pretty submissive.

117
00:05:14,943 --> 00:05:16,343
When you're in a
public restroom,

118
00:05:16,345 --> 00:05:18,746
which foot do you
flush the toilet with?

119
00:05:20,782 --> 00:05:23,117
Right. Always right.

120
00:05:23,119 --> 00:05:24,417
He's a righty.

121
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:26,987
Okay,

122
00:05:26,989 --> 00:05:28,088
show me en garde.

123
00:05:28,090 --> 00:05:30,424
Good. Knees bent,

124
00:05:30,425 --> 00:05:32,092
slightly over the toe.

125
00:05:32,093 --> 00:05:34,795
Non-sword hand up for balance.

126
00:05:34,797 --> 00:05:38,765
I am going
to feel this tomorrow.

127
00:05:38,766 --> 00:05:41,968
The first move
is called an advance.

128
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:44,438
You move your front foot
forward, heel to toe.

129
00:05:44,439 --> 00:05:46,439
Back foot
follows.

130
00:05:46,441 --> 00:05:48,842
So front foot forward,
heel to toe.

131
00:05:48,843 --> 00:05:50,576
Back foot follows.

132
00:05:50,578 --> 00:05:53,246
Now you try. Advance.

133
00:05:53,247 --> 00:05:56,816
And advance.
And advance.

134
00:05:56,819 --> 00:06:00,186
This is easy.
I didn't need to wear a cup.

135
00:06:00,189 --> 00:06:01,220
Good.

136
00:06:01,222 --> 00:06:02,989
The next move is called
a retreat.

137
00:06:02,991 --> 00:06:04,090
Step back.

138
00:06:04,092 --> 00:06:06,092
Back foot first, toe to heel.

139
00:06:06,093 --> 00:06:07,761
Front foot follows.

140
00:06:07,763 --> 00:06:09,395
On three.

141
00:06:09,398 --> 00:06:10,629
Excuse me, Barry?
Yes.

142
00:06:10,631 --> 00:06:12,999
When can I stab
one of my friends?

143
00:06:14,134 --> 00:06:15,869
In fencing,
we don't call it a stab.

144
00:06:15,871 --> 00:06:17,636
We call it a touch.
Uh, yes, I'm aware.

145
00:06:17,638 --> 00:06:19,506
But if I say I want
to touch one of my friends,

146
00:06:19,508 --> 00:06:22,542
I'll get called
into Human Resources.

147
00:06:22,544 --> 00:06:24,009
Okay, on three,

148
00:06:24,011 --> 00:06:27,480
Cooper and Koothrappali advance,
the other two retreat.

149
00:06:27,482 --> 00:06:31,150
One, two, three.

150
00:06:31,151 --> 00:06:32,852
Very good. Switch it up.

151
00:06:32,853 --> 00:06:34,821
One, two, three.

152
00:06:34,823 --> 00:06:37,456
Switch again.
One, two, three.

153
00:06:39,828 --> 00:06:41,494
Excuse me.

154
00:06:41,496 --> 00:06:43,261
Can I call you back?

155
00:06:43,263 --> 00:06:46,833
No, I'm teaching
a class.

156
00:06:46,835 --> 00:06:49,468
Sure.
Sure.

157
00:06:49,470 --> 00:06:51,703
An hour,
tops.

158
00:06:51,706 --> 00:06:53,138
Yeah. Okay.

159
00:06:53,141 --> 00:06:55,208
Okay.
Yeah.

160
00:06:55,210 --> 00:06:57,175
Okay. Thanks.

161
00:06:57,177 --> 00:07:01,047
And one,
two, three.

162
00:07:02,215 --> 00:07:05,650
Have you thought about
advertising directly to females?

163
00:07:05,653 --> 00:07:07,653
Hmm, okay.

164
00:07:07,655 --> 00:07:09,388
Well... All right.

165
00:07:09,390 --> 00:07:12,424
What if I put up a sign
in the window that said,

166
00:07:12,427 --> 00:07:15,261
"Women, come in.

167
00:07:15,263 --> 00:07:18,763
Don't be afraid."

168
00:07:21,367 --> 00:07:23,569
Hey.

169
00:07:23,571 --> 00:07:25,703
Uh, have you read the online
reviews for this place?

170
00:07:25,706 --> 00:07:26,739
Eh,

171
00:07:26,741 --> 00:07:27,706
the Internet's so negative.

172
00:07:27,708 --> 00:07:29,241
I try to avoid it.

173
00:07:29,242 --> 00:07:30,475
All right, well,
Heather H. says,

174
00:07:30,477 --> 00:07:32,377
"The owner stared at me
the whole time

175
00:07:32,379 --> 00:07:35,013
and didn't blink once."

176
00:07:43,422 --> 00:07:45,157
Kelly M. says,

177
00:07:45,158 --> 00:07:47,792
"The creepy guy who runs it
asked me out,

178
00:07:47,795 --> 00:07:51,362
then called himself stupid
before I could say no."

179
00:07:52,398 --> 00:07:55,299
Jessica K.
says,

180
00:07:55,302 --> 00:07:57,736
"I told the weird owner
that I liked his shirt.

181
00:07:57,737 --> 00:08:01,472
He took it off
and gave it to me."

182
00:08:01,475 --> 00:08:05,277
See? Negative.

183
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:09,181
With your foil extended,

184
00:08:09,182 --> 00:08:12,283
kick your front leg up and
push off with your back leg.

185
00:08:12,285 --> 00:08:14,052
Now you try.

186
00:08:14,821 --> 00:08:17,489
And
again.

187
00:08:17,491 --> 00:08:20,391
And again.

188
00:08:20,393 --> 00:08:23,561
Look at us! We're
like the Rockettes!

189
00:08:24,362 --> 00:08:26,131
En garde,
Leonard.

190
00:08:26,133 --> 00:08:29,434
Prepare yourself
for a rigorous touching.

191
00:08:32,338 --> 00:08:34,206
My name is Inigo Montoya.

192
00:08:34,208 --> 00:08:36,073
You killed my father.

193
00:08:36,075 --> 00:08:37,641
Prepare to die.

194
00:08:37,644 --> 00:08:39,310
My name

195
00:08:39,313 --> 00:08:40,344
is Inigo Montoya.

196
00:08:40,347 --> 00:08:42,780
You killed my
father. Prepare

197
00:08:42,783 --> 00:08:44,381
to die.

198
00:08:44,383 --> 00:08:46,718
I thought
you were Puss in Boots.

199
00:08:46,719 --> 00:08:47,952
Oh, yeah, right. Sorry.

200
00:08:47,953 --> 00:08:50,088
My name is Puss in Boots.

201
00:08:50,089 --> 00:08:51,856
You killed my father.

202
00:08:51,857 --> 00:08:53,591
Prepare to die.

203
00:08:55,795 --> 00:08:58,829
I'm looking forward to him
teaching us glove-slapping.

204
00:08:58,832 --> 00:09:00,631
What?

205
00:09:00,634 --> 00:09:03,200
You know, when my
honor is insulted,

206
00:09:03,203 --> 00:09:05,336
and I need to challenge
someone to a duel

207
00:09:05,338 --> 00:09:09,173
by slapping them across
the face with my glove.

208
00:09:09,174 --> 00:09:10,540
When was your honor insulted?

209
00:09:10,543 --> 00:09:14,145
My last physical.

210
00:09:14,146 --> 00:09:16,481
Again, that doctor
didn't insult your honor.

211
00:09:16,482 --> 00:09:18,650
Just checked your prostate.

212
00:09:20,118 --> 00:09:23,253
My name is Little
Orphan Annie.

213
00:09:23,256 --> 00:09:25,122
You killed my father.

214
00:09:25,125 --> 00:09:27,492
Prepare to die.

215
00:09:29,594 --> 00:09:32,729
My name is Darth Vader.

216
00:09:32,732 --> 00:09:35,833
I am your father. Ah!

217
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:39,837
This is fun.
Good.

218
00:09:39,838 --> 00:09:41,871
It's nice
to see your mind off Amy.

219
00:09:41,873 --> 00:09:43,306
What's going on with Amy?

220
00:09:43,309 --> 00:09:44,976
Not that it's any
of your business,

221
00:09:44,977 --> 00:09:46,376
but she broke up with me.

222
00:09:46,379 --> 00:09:47,877
Really?

223
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,579
Good to know.

224
00:09:51,549 --> 00:09:53,550
"Good to know"?

225
00:09:53,553 --> 00:09:55,386
What's that supposed to mean?
Oh.

226
00:09:55,387 --> 00:09:58,588
I hate to say it, but it sounds
like he's interested in her.

227
00:09:58,591 --> 00:10:01,625
Well, that's unacceptable.

228
00:10:01,626 --> 00:10:03,794
Oh, buddy, I get
that you don't like it,

229
00:10:03,795 --> 00:10:05,628
but it's not
really up to you.

230
00:10:05,631 --> 00:10:08,799
Yeah, but he's dumb,
and his face is dumb.

231
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:12,069
Look, even if it's not him,

232
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:15,572
Amy's probably going
to date someone at some point.

233
00:10:15,573 --> 00:10:17,207
You really think so?

234
00:10:17,208 --> 00:10:19,876
Of course.
She deserves to be happy.

235
00:10:19,878 --> 00:10:22,645
How dare you!

236
00:10:32,267 --> 00:10:33,901
Listen, I should warn you

237
00:10:33,904 --> 00:10:37,738
that maybe asking Amy out
isn't a good idea.

238
00:10:37,741 --> 00:10:39,140
Barry, a word?

239
00:10:39,141 --> 00:10:41,742
And now the crazy version
of what I just said.

240
00:10:43,445 --> 00:10:44,713
If you intend to pursue Amy,

241
00:10:44,714 --> 00:10:47,482
you leave me with no choice
but to put a stop to it.

242
00:10:47,483 --> 00:10:50,218
And how are you gonna do that?

243
00:10:50,219 --> 00:10:51,920
By challenging you to a duel.

244
00:10:52,954 --> 00:10:56,024
You've had one lesson.
I'll destroy you.

245
00:10:56,025 --> 00:10:58,193
That is why
the duel will take place

246
00:10:58,194 --> 00:11:01,161
at high noon,
three years from today.

247
00:11:02,731 --> 00:11:04,565
If you're worth your salt
as an instructor,

248
00:11:04,568 --> 00:11:05,799
I should be ready by then.

249
00:11:05,801 --> 00:11:07,868
Yeah, and be warned.

250
00:11:07,871 --> 00:11:09,904
I'm going to touch you all over.

251
00:11:12,274 --> 00:11:17,578
Wow. That-that was crazier
than I thought.

252
00:11:18,713 --> 00:11:21,582
All right,
I'm not saying

253
00:11:21,583 --> 00:11:23,985
it's true, but let's-let's
consider for a moment

254
00:11:23,987 --> 00:11:26,453
that possibly I'm the problem.
Yeah.

255
00:11:26,456 --> 00:11:27,722
You are.
You can say it.

256
00:11:27,723 --> 00:11:29,290
Okay, fine. What...?

257
00:11:29,291 --> 00:11:30,824
I mean, what
can I do?

258
00:11:30,827 --> 00:11:32,626
I get so nervous
around women.

259
00:11:32,629 --> 00:11:34,094
Well, you're talking
to us now.

260
00:11:34,097 --> 00:11:35,530
I mean, you don't seem nervous.

261
00:11:35,531 --> 00:11:37,131
Well, that's
'cause I'm doing that trick

262
00:11:37,132 --> 00:11:39,766
where you imagine
the audience is naked.

263
00:11:41,837 --> 00:11:44,371
By the way, thumbs up, ladies.

264
00:11:45,439 --> 00:11:47,942
Do you not hear
how creepy that sounds?

265
00:11:47,944 --> 00:11:49,876
It was a joke.

266
00:11:49,879 --> 00:11:51,045
Was it?

267
00:11:51,046 --> 00:11:52,847
No, I'm still doing it.

268
00:11:52,848 --> 00:11:55,750
Okay.

269
00:11:55,751 --> 00:11:57,718
Don't be offended, but...

270
00:11:57,719 --> 00:12:00,054
what went wrong with you?

271
00:12:00,055 --> 00:12:04,592
I-I guess I assumed
at this point in my life,

272
00:12:04,593 --> 00:12:07,727
I would be married
or in a relationship,

273
00:12:07,729 --> 00:12:09,163
or even have a pet

274
00:12:09,165 --> 00:12:11,865
that didn't run away
or kill itself.

275
00:12:12,733 --> 00:12:14,635
That really happened?

276
00:12:14,636 --> 00:12:16,971
I mean, I can't say for sure,
but I swear

277
00:12:16,972 --> 00:12:18,838
that rabbit looked me
right in the eye

278
00:12:18,841 --> 00:12:20,973
before it hopped
in front of that car.

279
00:12:20,976 --> 00:12:22,843
Anyway,

280
00:12:22,844 --> 00:12:25,078
the longer I'm alone,
the more desperate I get.

281
00:12:25,081 --> 00:12:30,516
Stuart, believe it or not,
I understand.

282
00:12:30,519 --> 00:12:32,051
You know, before I met Sheldon,

283
00:12:32,054 --> 00:12:34,688
I was alone
for a really long time.

284
00:12:34,689 --> 00:12:36,589
I was so desperate

285
00:12:36,592 --> 00:12:38,958
for people to like me,
when I met these guys,

286
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:42,228
it took everything in my power
to hide my insecurity.

287
00:12:45,232 --> 00:12:47,367
Okay, we're all feeling it.

288
00:12:47,368 --> 00:12:49,602
Yes, I'll go out with you.

289
00:12:52,873 --> 00:12:56,142
Suddenly, the rabbit thing
makes sense.

290
00:12:58,780 --> 00:13:01,680
I'm surprised you wanted to go
to a sports bar, Sheldon.

291
00:13:01,683 --> 00:13:04,150
Look at this blister.

292
00:13:04,152 --> 00:13:06,652
Like it or not,
we're athletes now.

293
00:13:06,655 --> 00:13:09,890
Besides, a bar is
where I belong.

294
00:13:09,891 --> 00:13:12,092
I'm having female problems.

295
00:13:12,093 --> 00:13:14,894
If you're cranky and retaining
water, I have a theory.

296
00:13:16,229 --> 00:13:19,098
Sheldon, instead of focusing
on Amy dating other guys,

297
00:13:19,101 --> 00:13:21,633
maybe you should start thinking
about dating another girl.

298
00:13:21,636 --> 00:13:23,803
That's ridiculous.

299
00:13:23,804 --> 00:13:25,104
Why? You never thought

300
00:13:25,107 --> 00:13:26,371
you'd end up in a relationship,

301
00:13:26,373 --> 00:13:27,540
and then you met Amy.

302
00:13:27,541 --> 00:13:29,007
Maybe there's someone else
out there for you.

303
00:13:29,010 --> 00:13:33,145
True, but Penny's married,
and so is Bernadette.

304
00:13:34,347 --> 00:13:36,549
And your girlfriend has
red hair and white skin,

305
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:39,718
which really rubs up
against my clown phobia.

306
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:42,621
Maybe you should consider women

307
00:13:42,623 --> 00:13:43,990
who aren't
in serious relationships

308
00:13:43,992 --> 00:13:45,558
with your closest friends?

309
00:13:45,559 --> 00:13:49,094
There's that prostate doctor,
but I'm still mad at her.

310
00:13:51,298 --> 00:13:52,899
Oh, there's a woman.

311
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:54,299
Oh, I'll make her my girlfriend.

312
00:13:54,301 --> 00:13:56,968
Whoa, whoa.

313
00:13:56,971 --> 00:14:01,107
Walking up to a strange woman
in a bar usually doesn't work.

314
00:14:01,108 --> 00:14:03,009
You're forgetting something.

315
00:14:03,011 --> 00:14:04,577
Ladies love jocks.

316
00:14:05,478 --> 00:14:07,746
How many sips
of that beer did he have?

317
00:14:07,748 --> 00:14:09,615
Three.
Oh, boy.

318
00:14:11,251 --> 00:14:16,021
Excuse me. I'm recovering
from a recent breakup,

319
00:14:16,024 --> 00:14:19,824
and I'm told asking out another
woman might make me feel better.

320
00:14:19,827 --> 00:14:24,030
And as Ash Ketchum said
to Pikachu, "I choose you."

321
00:14:24,031 --> 00:14:25,997
What?

322
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,166
It's a Pokémon reference.

323
00:14:28,169 --> 00:14:29,868
I don't know what that means.

324
00:14:29,871 --> 00:14:32,004
Well, we gave it a shot.

325
00:14:32,671 --> 00:14:35,406
How about you?

326
00:14:35,409 --> 00:14:38,611
I'm married,
and I'm her grandmother.

327
00:14:38,612 --> 00:14:41,447
Ah, what might have been.

328
00:14:41,448 --> 00:14:45,516
And you, give my regards
to Barnum and Bailey.

329
00:14:48,655 --> 00:14:51,991
Stuart took that rejection
like a pro.

330
00:14:51,992 --> 00:14:54,860
Well, he knew
he was on the breast cam.

331
00:14:56,762 --> 00:14:59,497
I don't have much practice
turning men down.

332
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:01,033
It wasn't so much fun.

333
00:15:01,035 --> 00:15:02,367
Oh, you get used to it.

334
00:15:02,368 --> 00:15:04,636
Some guys you have
to turn down over and over.

335
00:15:04,637 --> 00:15:07,338
And sometimes
we marry them anyway.

336
00:15:09,343 --> 00:15:11,577
Huh.

337
00:15:11,578 --> 00:15:13,812
Well, this is weird.

338
00:15:13,814 --> 00:15:16,881
What?
Barry Kripke just asked me out.

339
00:15:16,883 --> 00:15:18,250
Oh.

340
00:15:18,251 --> 00:15:20,618
Look at you—
two guys in one day!

341
00:15:20,621 --> 00:15:24,356
I told you things would change
if you plucked your eyebrows!

342
00:15:25,791 --> 00:15:27,525
What did he say?

343
00:15:27,527 --> 00:15:29,995
"Hi, how are you?
I was wondering

344
00:15:29,996 --> 00:15:32,930
if you'd like to get a drink
after work sometime."

345
00:15:32,933 --> 00:15:34,565
Well, what are
you gonna do?

346
00:15:34,568 --> 00:15:36,468
I don't know.

347
00:15:36,469 --> 00:15:39,538
I guess I assumed that I would
eventually date other people,

348
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:41,772
but this is happening so fast.

349
00:15:41,775 --> 00:15:43,375
What can it hurt?

350
00:15:43,376 --> 00:15:45,376
Well, I was hoping the
next person I dated

351
00:15:45,379 --> 00:15:47,344
would be a little
less like Sheldon.

352
00:15:47,347 --> 00:15:49,046
You mean, not a scientist?

353
00:15:49,049 --> 00:15:51,116
I think she means not a weirdo.

354
00:15:52,351 --> 00:15:53,751
Are you attracted
to him?

355
00:15:53,754 --> 00:15:55,987
I don't know.

356
00:15:55,988 --> 00:15:58,790
All right, well, what happens
if you imagine him naked?

357
00:15:58,791 --> 00:15:59,991
Oh, I don't have to imagine it.

358
00:16:07,632 --> 00:16:09,501
I smell funny.

359
00:16:11,337 --> 00:16:13,604
I taste salty.

360
00:16:13,607 --> 00:16:16,674
You're just sweaty
from exercise.

361
00:16:16,675 --> 00:16:18,175
And kind of delicious.

362
00:16:20,078 --> 00:16:23,613
I wonder how many licks it would
take to get to the center of me.

363
00:16:26,452 --> 00:16:28,920
I know it only takes
one doctor's finger.

364
00:16:31,857 --> 00:16:33,290
Hello.

365
00:16:33,293 --> 00:16:34,958
Hello.

366
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:36,560
We should let
you guys talk.

367
00:16:36,563 --> 00:16:37,495
Yeah.

368
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:38,795
You don't have to leave.

369
00:16:38,798 --> 00:16:40,631
Look at me go!

370
00:16:42,633 --> 00:16:43,934
Uh, Bernadette,
you're my ride.

371
00:16:43,937 --> 00:16:45,202
Walk!

372
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,842
How have you been?

373
00:16:51,843 --> 00:16:53,810
I'm doing all right.

374
00:16:53,813 --> 00:16:56,146
I tried fencing today.

375
00:16:56,149 --> 00:16:57,948
How'd that go?

376
00:16:57,949 --> 00:17:00,583
It was pretty easy.

377
00:17:00,586 --> 00:17:03,154
And I think my background
in "mathletics" helped.

378
00:17:04,823 --> 00:17:07,123
Barry Kripke was there.

379
00:17:07,125 --> 00:17:08,391
I should let you know

380
00:17:08,393 --> 00:17:11,327
that he expressed interest
in asking you out.

381
00:17:12,531 --> 00:17:14,230
Well, actually,
he-he already did.

382
00:17:14,233 --> 00:17:16,199
Okay.

383
00:17:16,201 --> 00:17:17,968
But don't get
too attached to him.

384
00:17:17,969 --> 00:17:21,104
In two years, 364 days,
he's a dead man.

385
00:17:24,409 --> 00:17:25,743
I said no.

386
00:17:25,745 --> 00:17:27,343
Interesting.

387
00:17:27,345 --> 00:17:31,515
I asked two women out today,
and they both said no.

388
00:17:31,516 --> 00:17:34,918
I didn't know you
were interested in dating.

389
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:38,188
I've been told
it's a good way to move on.

390
00:17:38,189 --> 00:17:40,524
Oh.

391
00:17:40,525 --> 00:17:42,391
Okay.

392
00:17:44,862 --> 00:17:48,564
Anyway, um,
it's nice to see you.

393
00:17:48,566 --> 00:17:50,167
You look good.

394
00:17:50,169 --> 00:17:51,168
Mmm, thanks.

395
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:52,568
And I taste good too.

396
00:18:04,239 --> 00:18:06,475
Howie?

397
00:18:06,725 --> 00:18:08,292
What's up?

398
00:18:09,129 --> 00:18:11,929
Why does your Fitbit say
you ran 174 miles yesterday?

399
00:18:15,829 --> 00:18:22,329
