1
00:00:02,438 --> 00:00:03,670
Helium.

2
00:00:03,672 --> 00:00:05,506
Yes.
Yes.

3
00:00:06,709 --> 00:00:07,474
Taylor Swift.

4
00:00:07,476 --> 00:00:08,609
Yes.

5
00:00:10,251 --> 00:00:10,933
Pi.

6
00:00:10,934 --> 00:00:12,280
Yes.

7
00:00:18,454 --> 00:00:19,553
Kardashian.

8
00:00:19,555 --> 00:00:21,321
More specific.

9
00:00:24,159 --> 00:00:25,192
Khloe?

10
00:00:25,194 --> 00:00:26,527
Yes!

11
00:00:26,529 --> 00:00:27,561
See, I remembered

12
00:00:27,563 --> 00:00:29,296
because if it looks
like Kim it's Kim,

13
00:00:29,298 --> 00:00:30,864
if it looks kind of
like Kim it's Kourtney,

14
00:00:30,866 --> 00:00:32,566
and if it looks nothing
like Kim it's Khloe.

15
00:00:32,568 --> 00:00:33,767
Oh.

16
00:00:33,769 --> 00:00:34,968
Oh,

17
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:37,004
that's a Venn Diagram,
and I remember because

18
00:00:37,006 --> 00:00:38,338
I thought to myself,

19
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:40,340
"Venn is he gonna stop
talking about this diagram?"

20
00:00:42,411 --> 00:00:44,011
What are you guys doing?
Oh, well,

21
00:00:44,013 --> 00:00:45,913
we decided to use
our breakfast time

22
00:00:45,915 --> 00:00:48,549
to expand our respective
knowledge bases.

23
00:00:48,551 --> 00:00:49,783
Oh, let me try.

24
00:00:49,785 --> 00:00:51,852
Okay.

25
00:00:51,854 --> 00:00:55,522
Hmm, atom of hydrogen,
Adam of Maroon 5, mic drop.

26
00:00:58,427 --> 00:01:00,527
I'm sorry,
who is Mike Drop?

27
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:04,031
Oh, hey, Penny, do you want
to go to the airport

28
00:01:04,033 --> 00:01:05,365
with me later
to pick up my mother?

29
00:01:05,367 --> 00:01:06,400
Sure.
Thanks.

30
00:01:06,402 --> 00:01:07,834
No problem.
Hey, Penny,

31
00:01:07,836 --> 00:01:09,503
um, since you're already
gonna be at the airport,

32
00:01:09,505 --> 00:01:10,671
do I need to go?

33
00:01:12,041 --> 00:01:14,541
Why don't you want to get
your mother from the airport?

34
00:01:14,543 --> 00:01:16,410
Well, I can do without
the 40-minute car ride

35
00:01:16,412 --> 00:01:18,512
where she criticizes
every aspect of my life.

36
00:01:18,514 --> 00:01:22,015
She can cover it
in a car ride?

37
00:01:22,017 --> 00:01:24,918
I could do 40 minutes
on your posture alone.

38
00:01:25,854 --> 00:01:27,120
You really want me to pick up

39
00:01:27,122 --> 00:01:28,121
your mother all by myself?

40
00:01:28,123 --> 00:01:29,856
Hmm, I just feel like

41
00:01:29,858 --> 00:01:31,592
it would be a good chance
for you to bond.

42
00:01:31,594 --> 00:01:33,193
Or a way for you to avoid her?

43
00:01:33,195 --> 00:01:35,495
I don't know what
he's putting on those cards,

44
00:01:35,497 --> 00:01:37,798
but you are smarter than ever.

45
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:40,968
Fine, if you really want me to,
I will pick your mom up.

46
00:01:40,970 --> 00:01:42,069
Seriously?

47
00:01:42,071 --> 00:01:43,670
Yeah, you know what,
she is my mother-in-law,

48
00:01:43,672 --> 00:01:45,739
and I'd like for us
to have a good relationship.

49
00:01:45,741 --> 00:01:47,674
That is very mature of you,

50
00:01:47,676 --> 00:01:50,510
so I'm gonna go ahead
and say, "Suckah."

51
00:01:50,512 --> 00:01:53,280
All right, back to learning.
Okay.

52
00:01:54,883 --> 00:01:56,950
Oh, easy, Bill Nye
the Science Guy.

53
00:01:56,952 --> 00:01:58,185
Or as I know him...

54
00:01:58,187 --> 00:02:00,854
"Creepy old dude
from Dancing with the Stars."

55
00:02:00,856 --> 00:02:02,322

63
00:02:31,737 --> 00:02:34,338
Did you guys see there's
an Avengers screening?

64
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:36,161
Joss Whedon's gonna show
some deleted scenes

65
00:02:36,162 --> 00:02:37,928
and do a question
and answer session.

66
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:39,863
Oh, well, I have
a few questions for him

67
00:02:39,865 --> 00:02:43,567
about the last Avengers movie...
and a whole lot of answers.

68
00:02:43,569 --> 00:02:46,270
When's the screening?

69
00:02:46,272 --> 00:02:48,272
Uh, it's tonight, but it's
first-come, first-served,

70
00:02:48,274 --> 00:02:50,240
so we should probably get
there early and wait in line.

71
00:02:50,242 --> 00:02:52,209
Let's do it.

72
00:02:52,211 --> 00:02:53,777
Penny's busy with my mother,
so I'm in.

73
00:02:53,779 --> 00:02:55,412
Oh, bad news.

74
00:02:55,414 --> 00:02:57,481
Amy's making me go shopping
with her later,

75
00:02:57,483 --> 00:02:59,883
so looks like none of us can go.

76
00:03:01,721 --> 00:03:05,022
You do realize we're allowed
to have fun without you?

77
00:03:05,024 --> 00:03:07,591
In fact, that's usually
the trick to it.

78
00:03:09,261 --> 00:03:11,028
What time do we
need to get there?

79
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:12,629
Uh, I'd say by 3:00.

80
00:03:12,631 --> 00:03:14,431
You're really going without me?

81
00:03:14,433 --> 00:03:15,432
It's not a big deal.

82
00:03:15,434 --> 00:03:16,734
Go shopping with Amy,

83
00:03:16,736 --> 00:03:18,135
and we'll save
a spot in line for you.

84
00:03:18,137 --> 00:03:21,205
You don't have the authority
to save places in the line.

85
00:03:21,207 --> 00:03:22,506
If I do that, I'll be cutting.

86
00:03:22,508 --> 00:03:24,341
People do it all the time.

87
00:03:24,343 --> 00:03:25,909
You know the golden rule
of line etiquette:

88
00:03:25,911 --> 00:03:28,379
"No cuts, no buts,
no coconuts."

89
00:03:28,381 --> 00:03:30,381
If you really
care that much,

90
00:03:30,383 --> 00:03:33,083
there are apps now that'll let
you hire people to do stuff

91
00:03:33,085 --> 00:03:35,252
like errands and
wait in lines.

92
00:03:35,254 --> 00:03:38,422
People are actually
waiting in lines as a job?

93
00:03:38,424 --> 00:03:42,826
Boy, makes me feel better
about my life.

94
00:03:42,828 --> 00:03:44,828
Some of these guys make
over $20 an hour.

95
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:47,131
And now I feel worse again.

96
00:03:49,402 --> 00:03:52,736
I'm not surprised Leonard
chose to avoid picking me up.

97
00:03:52,738 --> 00:03:56,740
He's battled intimacy issues
his whole life.

98
00:03:56,742 --> 00:04:00,277
Does he have difficulty
maintaining erections?

99
00:04:00,279 --> 00:04:02,613
Wow.

100
00:04:02,615 --> 00:04:04,581
Didn't even make it
out of the parking lot.

101
00:04:05,684 --> 00:04:07,084
Uh, you know what,
enough about Leonard.

102
00:04:07,086 --> 00:04:08,352
Let's talk about you.

103
00:04:08,354 --> 00:04:10,120
What would you like to
do while you're here?

104
00:04:10,122 --> 00:04:12,022
Dear, I'm a psychiatrist.

105
00:04:12,024 --> 00:04:15,025
You don't have to avoid having
intimate conversations with me.

106
00:04:15,027 --> 00:04:18,429
Well, I'd actually like
for us to be close,

107
00:04:18,431 --> 00:04:20,397
but maybe we start
with our favorite books

108
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:23,000
and work our way up
to my husband's sex organs.

109
00:04:24,904 --> 00:04:26,203
Very well.

110
00:04:26,205 --> 00:04:27,371
What's the last book
you read?

111
00:04:27,373 --> 00:04:31,075
Um, does Pottery Barn,
Spring count?

112
00:04:33,179 --> 00:04:36,146
Penny, it's only natural to want
your mother-in-law to like you,

113
00:04:36,148 --> 00:04:39,316
and I acknowledge I can be
an intimidating person.

114
00:04:39,318 --> 00:04:43,053
So what can I do to make
this process easier for you?

115
00:04:43,055 --> 00:04:44,354
Uh, for starters,

116
00:04:44,356 --> 00:04:46,490
maybe you can not psychoanalyze
everything I say?

117
00:04:46,492 --> 00:04:48,826
And how does it
make you feel

118
00:04:48,828 --> 00:04:51,895
when I psychoanalyze
everything you say?

119
00:04:51,897 --> 00:04:54,264
Uncomfortable.

120
00:04:54,266 --> 00:04:55,532
That was a joke, dear.

121
00:04:55,534 --> 00:04:57,101
Oh. Sorry.

122
00:04:57,103 --> 00:04:58,902
Didn't know you made those.

123
00:05:00,606 --> 00:05:02,339
Hey, listen, what
if we have a little

124
00:05:02,341 --> 00:05:05,342
mother-in-law-daughter-in-law
dinner tonight?

125
00:05:05,344 --> 00:05:07,377
So just the two of us?

126
00:05:07,379 --> 00:05:09,913
Or I invite a few girlfriends,

127
00:05:09,915 --> 00:05:11,315
'cause hearing you say
"the two of us"

128
00:05:11,317 --> 00:05:13,584
just sent a chill
right down my spine.

129
00:05:18,090 --> 00:05:20,090
Hey.

130
00:05:20,092 --> 00:05:21,525
What are you doing here?

131
00:05:21,527 --> 00:05:22,526
You're not Sheldon.

132
00:05:22,528 --> 00:05:25,395
I thought that might come up.

133
00:05:26,532 --> 00:05:28,532
Sheldon hired me to go
shopping with you.

134
00:05:28,534 --> 00:05:30,434
Hold on.

135
00:05:30,436 --> 00:05:33,470
He paid you to get out
of spending time with me?

136
00:05:33,472 --> 00:05:35,772
No, it's not like that.

137
00:05:35,774 --> 00:05:38,542
There's a long line
he'd rather stand in.

138
00:05:40,179 --> 00:05:41,879
So what are we doing?
Old Navy, Build-A-Bear?

139
00:05:41,881 --> 00:05:43,480
I get paid either way.

140
00:05:45,551 --> 00:05:47,584
We're not going
shopping together.

141
00:05:47,586 --> 00:05:49,586
You sure?
I'm happy to hold your bag.

142
00:05:49,588 --> 00:05:52,523
And Sheldon gave me money
for a hotdog on a stick.

143
00:05:54,059 --> 00:05:56,460
Can you understand why
I might be annoyed right now?

144
00:05:56,462 --> 00:06:00,464
Look, lady,
I just work here.

145
00:06:02,935 --> 00:06:06,770
We've waited in a lot of
lines together, haven't we?

146
00:06:06,772 --> 00:06:08,338
Remember when we camped out

147
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:10,007
for the Doctor Who panel
at Comic-Con?

148
00:06:10,009 --> 00:06:12,009
Yeah, sleeping under the
stars with other fans

149
00:06:12,011 --> 00:06:13,710
who love the show
as much as we do.

150
00:06:13,712 --> 00:06:16,947
Waking up, wondering which one
of those fans stole our wallets.

151
00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:20,684
Stuart,
what are you doing here?

152
00:06:20,686 --> 00:06:22,653
Sheldon, you are the most
inconsiderate person

153
00:06:22,655 --> 00:06:25,556
I have ever met
in my entire life!

154
00:06:26,759 --> 00:06:28,258
Where do you get off sending me

155
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:30,460
to shop with your girlfriend?

156
00:06:30,462 --> 00:06:31,762
I don't understand.

157
00:06:31,764 --> 00:06:33,263
You were happy to do this
when I hired you.

158
00:06:33,265 --> 00:06:34,865
Why-why are you
upset with me now?

159
00:06:34,867 --> 00:06:38,202
Oh, I'm not upset with you, but
Amy's pretty bent out of shape,

160
00:06:38,204 --> 00:06:42,506
so she hired me
to let you have it.

161
00:06:44,109 --> 00:06:46,276
Well, I suppose
turnabout is fair play.

162
00:06:46,278 --> 00:06:49,213
You're darn right it's fair
play, you selfish jerk!

163
00:06:53,319 --> 00:06:54,585
You know, just when I think

164
00:06:54,587 --> 00:06:56,119
we're making progress
in our relationship,

165
00:06:56,121 --> 00:06:57,754
we revert to our old patterns

166
00:06:57,756 --> 00:06:59,456
where thoughts and feelings
go unexpressed.

167
00:06:59,458 --> 00:07:01,124
I mean, if he didn't want
to go shopping with me,

168
00:07:01,126 --> 00:07:02,593
why didn't he just say so?

169
00:07:02,595 --> 00:07:06,496
Maybe he couldn't get
a word in edgewise.

170
00:07:09,134 --> 00:07:11,168
I'm sorry, I've been
going on and on.

171
00:07:11,170 --> 00:07:12,803
Oh, it's all right, dear.

172
00:07:12,805 --> 00:07:15,772
Sheldon has a brilliant
and complicated mind.

173
00:07:15,774 --> 00:07:18,809
It's understandable that being
in a relationship with him

174
00:07:18,811 --> 00:07:20,043
could be trying.

175
00:07:20,045 --> 00:07:21,478
I called him "babe" once.

176
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:24,281
He asked me to get a drug test.

177
00:07:25,851 --> 00:07:27,751
Well, I do admire your resolve.

178
00:07:27,753 --> 00:07:30,387
You're an extraordinary woman.
Thank you.

179
00:07:30,389 --> 00:07:32,756
You know, she's
my mother-in-law.

180
00:07:32,758 --> 00:07:34,491
Why can't I bond
with her like that?

181
00:07:34,493 --> 00:07:37,894
Amy's with Sheldon
who she loves like a son.

182
00:07:37,896 --> 00:07:39,730
You're with her son...

183
00:07:39,732 --> 00:07:42,499
who she doesn't.

184
00:07:42,501 --> 00:07:45,535
Do you realize it took me five
years to get a massage from him?

185
00:07:45,537 --> 00:07:49,206
Oh, well, that still could be
a big step for Sheldon.

186
00:07:49,208 --> 00:07:51,208
Three minutes.

187
00:07:51,210 --> 00:07:54,211
And he used a kitchen timer.

188
00:07:54,213 --> 00:07:56,647
I felt like a soft-boiled egg.

189
00:07:58,150 --> 00:08:00,150
You know, being in a
relationship with Leonard

190
00:08:00,152 --> 00:08:02,286
also comes
with its challenges.

191
00:08:02,288 --> 00:08:03,620
Yes.

192
00:08:03,622 --> 00:08:06,990
Well, what can you do?

193
00:08:10,462 --> 00:08:12,529
Maybe it's Sheldon,
here to say he's sorry.

194
00:08:12,531 --> 00:08:15,365
Sheldon says he's sorry.

195
00:08:18,337 --> 00:08:20,604
Bernadette, I'll give you
five dollars to slam the door.

196
00:08:20,606 --> 00:08:22,205
I would have done
it for three.

197
00:08:32,022 --> 00:08:34,656
Boy, all this standing's
making me tired.

198
00:08:34,658 --> 00:08:38,526
Good thing I brought
my collapsible stick chair.

199
00:08:38,528 --> 00:08:41,129
Not the stick chair.

200
00:08:41,131 --> 00:08:42,897
You look like an idiot
on that thing.

201
00:08:42,899 --> 00:08:45,266
Sticks and stones
may break my bones,

202
00:08:45,268 --> 00:08:48,169
but chairs on sticks
are comfy.

203
00:08:49,039 --> 00:08:50,772
Hey.
Hey.

204
00:08:50,774 --> 00:08:52,941
Is everything
smoothed out with Amy?

205
00:08:52,943 --> 00:08:54,809
Uh, no, she's still pretty mad.

206
00:08:54,811 --> 00:08:58,146
Did you make the apology
as sincere as I would have?

207
00:08:58,148 --> 00:09:00,782
I said,
"Sheldon says he's sorry."

208
00:09:00,784 --> 00:09:03,685
Oh, well, that's
laying it on a little thick.

209
00:09:05,622 --> 00:09:08,356
You think it's time you
apologize to her yourself?

210
00:09:08,358 --> 00:09:09,924
I suppose so.

211
00:09:09,926 --> 00:09:11,815
But if I get out of the line,
I'll lose my spot.

212
00:09:11,816 --> 00:09:14,416
I'm happy to hold your place
till you get back.

213
00:09:14,418 --> 00:09:15,718
You would do that?

214
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:18,087
Consider it my way
of getting more of your money.

215
00:09:19,223 --> 00:09:21,957
You're a good man.

216
00:09:23,094 --> 00:09:24,727
So, Beverly,
did you know Penny

217
00:09:24,729 --> 00:09:26,395
is the number
three sales rep

218
00:09:26,397 --> 00:09:27,997
at our pharmaceutical company?

219
00:09:27,999 --> 00:09:30,032
Oh, I didn't realize
you two work together.

220
00:09:30,034 --> 00:09:31,367
Well, we don't exactly.

221
00:09:31,369 --> 00:09:33,502
I'm a microbiologist
for the research team.

222
00:09:33,504 --> 00:09:35,004
Oh, what are you
currently developing?

223
00:09:35,006 --> 00:09:37,039
Some exciting new
anti-anxiety drugs.

224
00:09:37,041 --> 00:09:38,340
That's interesting.

225
00:09:38,342 --> 00:09:41,443
I just attended a lecture
on pediatric anxiety.

226
00:09:41,445 --> 00:09:43,946
Oh, was it, uh,
Dr. Jenofski?

227
00:09:43,948 --> 00:09:45,014
I just saw
his TED Talk!

228
00:09:45,016 --> 00:09:46,248
It was.

229
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:47,883
Let's get back to Penny.

230
00:09:47,885 --> 00:09:49,184
Hey, weren't you telling me

231
00:09:49,186 --> 00:09:50,719
something great
about your company car?

232
00:09:50,721 --> 00:09:52,187
Um...

233
00:09:54,258 --> 00:09:57,893
It has seat warmers.

234
00:10:00,031 --> 00:10:01,830
Amy! Amy!

235
00:10:01,832 --> 00:10:03,532
Amy!
Come in.

236
00:10:03,534 --> 00:10:05,167
Hello, everyone.

237
00:10:05,169 --> 00:10:06,569
Oh, Beverly, good to see you!

238
00:10:06,571 --> 00:10:08,337
I'd love to chat,
but there's a line

239
00:10:08,339 --> 00:10:10,205
that could start moving
any minute, so let's do this.

240
00:10:10,207 --> 00:10:11,340
Amy?

241
00:10:11,342 --> 00:10:13,275
A proper apology
requires three steps.

242
00:10:13,277 --> 00:10:15,477
Step one...
an admission of wrongdoing.

243
00:10:15,479 --> 00:10:17,413
Amy, I was wrong.
Step two...

244
00:10:17,415 --> 00:10:19,548
a promise never
to repeat said action.

245
00:10:19,550 --> 00:10:22,251
Amy, that action will never be
repeated, and that's a promise.

246
00:10:22,253 --> 00:10:24,753
Step three... an earnest request
for forgiveness.

247
00:10:24,755 --> 00:10:26,021
Amy, I hope you can forgive me.

248
00:10:26,023 --> 00:10:27,289
And I hope you
do it right now,

249
00:10:27,291 --> 00:10:28,657
'cause there's an Uber
waiting downstairs,

250
00:10:28,659 --> 00:10:30,292
and I don't want to repeat
this apology nonsense

251
00:10:30,294 --> 00:10:32,428
with my driver Ganesh.

252
00:10:33,664 --> 00:10:35,965
Fine.

253
00:10:35,967 --> 00:10:37,566
Oh, thanks!
You're a peach!

254
00:10:37,568 --> 00:10:38,767
Beverly, we'll
catch up soon.

255
00:10:38,769 --> 00:10:40,069
Bernadette, it was
a pleasure as always,

256
00:10:40,071 --> 00:10:41,637
Penny, you have
spinach in your teeth.

257
00:10:43,674 --> 00:10:46,976
How long have I had spinach
in my teeth?

258
00:10:46,978 --> 00:10:48,444
Since the airport, dear.

259
00:10:51,716 --> 00:10:55,484
You look like you come
with a kickstand.

260
00:10:55,486 --> 00:10:57,786
You can't make me feel bad.

261
00:10:57,788 --> 00:11:00,089
Hmm, maybe not. Leonard?

262
00:11:00,091 --> 00:11:02,958
So, when the aliens
brought you back,

263
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:05,327
they just left the probe in?

264
00:11:06,297 --> 00:11:08,230
I'm back.

265
00:11:08,232 --> 00:11:10,199
Hey, how'd it go?
It went well.

266
00:11:10,201 --> 00:11:12,034
Yeah, I've learned that
if you never say you're sorry,

267
00:11:12,036 --> 00:11:15,638
the times you do really
puts them on their heels.

268
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:18,207
Uh, Stuart, I relieve you
of your line duties.

269
00:11:18,209 --> 00:11:20,509
Anyone else need
anything before I go?

270
00:11:20,511 --> 00:11:23,512
I'll give you a dollar
if make fun of Raj.

271
00:11:23,514 --> 00:11:25,981
That's mean.
Five.

272
00:11:25,983 --> 00:11:28,550
You look like Tigger
if Tigger looked like a jackass.

273
00:11:30,588 --> 00:11:32,621
Uh, if you ever need
a reference or anything,

274
00:11:32,623 --> 00:11:34,690
just let me know.

275
00:11:34,692 --> 00:11:36,291
Hey, guys.

276
00:11:36,293 --> 00:11:37,493
You made it.

277
00:11:37,495 --> 00:11:39,695
Did you see that?

278
00:11:39,697 --> 00:11:41,864
He just cut the line.

279
00:11:41,866 --> 00:11:43,465
He's just joining
his friends; it's fine.

280
00:11:43,467 --> 00:11:45,034
No, it's not fine.

281
00:11:45,036 --> 00:11:47,336
It is a breach
of line etiquette.

282
00:11:47,338 --> 00:11:48,804
We're near the front
of the line.

283
00:11:48,806 --> 00:11:50,205
We'll get in either way.

284
00:11:50,207 --> 00:11:52,107
What if every person in front
of us lets someone cut?

285
00:11:52,109 --> 00:11:52,647
We'd still get in.

286
00:11:52,651 --> 00:11:54,610
What if each of those people
let someone cut?

287
00:11:54,612 --> 00:11:55,295
Still get in.

288
00:11:55,319 --> 00:11:56,780
But then each of those
people let someone cut?

289
00:11:56,781 --> 00:11:58,714
We'd still get in,
but first I'd hit you

290
00:11:58,716 --> 00:12:01,016
over the head
with his stick chair.

291
00:12:03,054 --> 00:12:04,720
Excuse me.
Oh, please don't.

292
00:12:04,722 --> 00:12:06,955
Uh, uh, I couldn't
help but notice

293
00:12:06,957 --> 00:12:08,691
that you cut the line.

294
00:12:08,693 --> 00:12:09,958
Oh, uh, I'm with my friends.

295
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:10,959
It's cool.

296
00:12:10,961 --> 00:12:12,161
Well, no.

297
00:12:12,163 --> 00:12:13,696
It's not cool.

298
00:12:13,698 --> 00:12:16,031
If there were
reserved seating,

299
00:12:16,033 --> 00:12:17,933
and we all had tickets,
that would be fine.

300
00:12:17,935 --> 00:12:19,368
But this line is
first-come, first-served.

301
00:12:19,370 --> 00:12:21,770
Not "show up tardy and
nevertheless be first served".

302
00:12:21,772 --> 00:12:23,038
Right here.

303
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,240
No.

304
00:12:27,011 --> 00:12:28,644
You need to go to
the back of the line.

305
00:12:28,646 --> 00:12:31,480
Uh, who made you line monitor?

306
00:12:31,482 --> 00:12:34,450
Mrs. Wunch in fourth grade.

307
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:37,119
And my slogan was
"a line that's straight

308
00:12:37,121 --> 00:12:39,288
is a line that's great"

309
00:12:40,458 --> 00:12:42,024
Is this guy for real?

310
00:12:42,026 --> 00:12:45,694
Boy, I wish
I could say no.

311
00:12:46,831 --> 00:12:49,732
That was very nice
of Sheldon to apologize.

312
00:12:49,734 --> 00:12:51,834
Well, he's come a long way.

313
00:12:51,836 --> 00:12:54,436
Or a short way very slowly,

314
00:12:54,438 --> 00:12:57,873
so it feels like a long way.

315
00:12:57,875 --> 00:13:00,576
Your relationship
with him is fascinating.

316
00:13:00,578 --> 00:13:03,512
I'm preparing to write a book
on high-achieving couples,

317
00:13:03,514 --> 00:13:05,447
and I would love to
interview the both of you.

318
00:13:05,449 --> 00:13:06,849
Oh, sure.

319
00:13:06,851 --> 00:13:08,650
I'll-I'll talk
to Sheldon about it.

320
00:13:08,652 --> 00:13:10,719
You know, Bernadette's husband
is a former astronaut.

321
00:13:10,721 --> 00:13:12,488
Really?

322
00:13:12,490 --> 00:13:13,589
Do you think
he would be interested

323
00:13:13,591 --> 00:13:14,823
in being interviewed
as well?

324
00:13:14,825 --> 00:13:16,358
Do I think he'd be interested?

325
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:18,260
Sometimes I hear him
pretending to be interviewed

326
00:13:18,262 --> 00:13:20,229
when he's alone
in the bathroom.

327
00:13:20,231 --> 00:13:22,231
Wonderful!

328
00:13:22,233 --> 00:13:24,500
I'll give you
my contact information.

329
00:13:25,603 --> 00:13:28,704
Um, you should probably
talk to Penny, too.

330
00:13:28,706 --> 00:13:31,974
About what?

331
00:13:32,910 --> 00:13:33,942
Okay, you know what?

332
00:13:33,944 --> 00:13:35,544
This is ridiculous.

333
00:13:35,546 --> 00:13:36,678
I've been trying to make

334
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:37,813
a connection with you all day,

335
00:13:37,815 --> 00:13:39,081
and clearly I'm getting nowhere.

336
00:13:39,083 --> 00:13:41,183
Well, are you
seeking a connection

337
00:13:41,185 --> 00:13:43,819
or just some form of validation?

338
00:13:43,821 --> 00:13:46,455
What I was seeking was
some sort of friendship.

339
00:13:46,457 --> 00:13:49,024
But at this point, I'll take you
not insulting me to my face.

340
00:13:49,026 --> 00:13:51,360
My intention was never
to insult you.

341
00:13:51,362 --> 00:13:52,728
You've been doing it all day!

342
00:13:52,730 --> 00:13:54,429
Do you even know
what an insult is?

343
00:13:54,431 --> 00:13:56,398
Well, it's not a clinical term.

344
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:59,101
But one example would be
your marrying my son,

345
00:13:59,103 --> 00:14:00,803
and not inviting me
or even telling me

346
00:14:00,805 --> 00:14:02,604
the wedding was taking place.

347
00:14:05,342 --> 00:14:07,609
Okay, good example.

348
00:14:11,081 --> 00:14:14,216
What about Joss Whedon's work
makes you think he'd be okay

349
00:14:14,218 --> 00:14:16,251
with rule-breakers
and line-cutters?

350
00:14:16,253 --> 00:14:18,053
The Avengers are rule-breakers!

351
00:14:18,055 --> 00:14:21,123
Being vengeful is in
their job description!

352
00:14:21,125 --> 00:14:23,892
They work for SHIELD,

353
00:14:23,894 --> 00:14:26,128
which is a sanctioned department
of the U.S. Government!

354
00:14:26,130 --> 00:14:27,796
Do you work for a
sanctioned department

355
00:14:27,798 --> 00:14:29,531
of the U.S. Government?

356
00:14:29,533 --> 00:14:30,966
As a matter of fact I do.

357
00:14:30,968 --> 00:14:34,570
At a little place
called the DMV.

358
00:14:35,973 --> 00:14:37,105
He's got him there.

359
00:14:37,107 --> 00:14:40,709
The D even stands
for department.

360
00:14:40,711 --> 00:14:41,910
Excuse me!

361
00:14:41,912 --> 00:14:43,011
Excuse me,
can I please

362
00:14:43,013 --> 00:14:44,413
see a show of hands?

363
00:14:44,415 --> 00:14:47,049
Who here takes issue with
this person cutting the line?

364
00:14:48,819 --> 00:14:51,286
Told you.

365
00:14:51,288 --> 00:14:53,555
Well, what a sad
state of affairs!

366
00:14:53,557 --> 00:14:55,424
That you've all been
so ground down

367
00:14:55,426 --> 00:14:58,060
by life, you don't even notice
when someone disrespects you.

368
00:14:58,062 --> 00:14:59,695
I can't believe
we're gonna get beat up,

369
00:14:59,697 --> 00:15:03,265
and it's not
because of your chair.

370
00:15:03,267 --> 00:15:05,567
You know, right now,
at the back of this line,

371
00:15:05,569 --> 00:15:07,236
there's a movie fan
like you

372
00:15:07,238 --> 00:15:08,670
who's not going to get in,

373
00:15:08,672 --> 00:15:11,039
because this person
simply doesn't care.

374
00:15:11,041 --> 00:15:12,507
Yeah, well, 61 years ago,

375
00:15:12,509 --> 00:15:14,643
there was another person
at the back of the line

376
00:15:14,645 --> 00:15:16,945
and her name
was Rosa Parks.

377
00:15:20,017 --> 00:15:22,251
Okay, you may have
to pretend you're black

378
00:15:22,253 --> 00:15:25,487
to get us out of here.

379
00:15:25,489 --> 00:15:27,956
Now, let's follow in that
brave woman's footsteps,

380
00:15:27,958 --> 00:15:30,259
and stand up for ourselves!

381
00:15:30,261 --> 00:15:32,761
And-and I realize that she
stood up by remaining seated,

382
00:15:32,763 --> 00:15:35,097
but now is not that time
to enjoy the irony of that.

383
00:15:35,099 --> 00:15:36,665
Now, I ask you again.

384
00:15:36,667 --> 00:15:38,834
Who here takes issue
with this person...?

385
00:15:38,836 --> 00:15:40,969
Why should we listen to you?
You cut the line yourself.

386
00:15:40,971 --> 00:15:43,272
I most certainly did not.

387
00:15:43,274 --> 00:15:45,040
I saw you.

388
00:15:45,042 --> 00:15:47,376
If you're feeling dizzy,

389
00:15:47,378 --> 00:15:50,078
it's because the tables
have turned.

390
00:15:51,882 --> 00:15:55,250
Excuse me, I paid someone
to wait in line for me,

391
00:15:55,252 --> 00:15:56,919
and then
when I arrived,

392
00:15:56,921 --> 00:15:58,720
he left, so what you
saw, my good woman,

393
00:15:58,722 --> 00:16:01,256
was "swapsies",
not "cutsies".

394
00:16:01,258 --> 00:16:02,591
Oh, no, no, no, no, wait!

395
00:16:02,593 --> 00:16:04,059
I ask you all again.
A show of hands.

396
00:16:04,061 --> 00:16:05,928
Who here takes issue...?
Well, stop moving!

397
00:16:05,930 --> 00:16:06,895
He's gonna get in!

398
00:16:06,897 --> 00:16:08,163
Buddy, let it go.
No, I can't.

399
00:16:08,165 --> 00:16:09,298
This isn't right.

400
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:10,365
You did everything you could.

401
00:16:10,367 --> 00:16:12,935
No, I could've done more.

402
00:16:12,937 --> 00:16:15,437
Now, now, you
denigrated the memory

403
00:16:15,439 --> 00:16:17,105
of a great civil
rights pioneer.

404
00:16:17,107 --> 00:16:18,540
That's all anyone could ask.

405
00:16:21,578 --> 00:16:25,580
To be honest, I'm surprised you
cared about the wedding at all.

406
00:16:25,582 --> 00:16:27,516
I'm still human, Penny.

407
00:16:27,518 --> 00:16:29,484
Not getting invited
to my own son's wedding

408
00:16:29,486 --> 00:16:31,420
is difficult to ignore.

409
00:16:31,422 --> 00:16:32,821
I know how you feel.

410
00:16:32,823 --> 00:16:34,723
She didn't invite any of us.

411
00:16:34,725 --> 00:16:36,425
It was spur of the moment!

412
00:16:36,427 --> 00:16:39,294
But we did get to see a live
stream of it on the Internet.

413
00:16:39,296 --> 00:16:41,830
I could've watched it
on the Internet?

414
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:46,034
Thank you.

415
00:16:47,204 --> 00:16:49,871
So if we would have asked you
to come to Vegas

416
00:16:49,873 --> 00:16:52,240
to see us get married,
you would've come?

417
00:16:52,242 --> 00:16:55,210
No, I would've said
you're making a huge mistake.

418
00:16:55,212 --> 00:16:58,146
But an invitation
would've been nice.

419
00:16:58,148 --> 00:17:01,917
You really think
we made a mistake?

420
00:17:01,919 --> 00:17:03,552
At the time I did.

421
00:17:03,554 --> 00:17:05,921
But I-I've never seen
Leonard so happy,

422
00:17:05,923 --> 00:17:08,690
so... perhaps I was wrong.

423
00:17:08,692 --> 00:17:10,792
Wow.

424
00:17:10,794 --> 00:17:12,794
Okay.

425
00:17:12,796 --> 00:17:14,696
Well, um, how about this?

426
00:17:14,698 --> 00:17:16,198
Maybe while
you're still in town,

427
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:19,101
Leonard and I could have
another small ceremony.

428
00:17:19,103 --> 00:17:21,336
You know, if you're interested.

429
00:17:21,338 --> 00:17:24,940
I would find that
perfectly acceptable.

430
00:17:24,942 --> 00:17:26,842
She would find it

431
00:17:26,844 --> 00:17:28,243
perfectly acceptable!

432
00:17:28,245 --> 00:17:30,445
You guys saw it! We bonded!

433
00:17:42,068 --> 00:17:43,334
Howie?

434
00:17:43,336 --> 00:17:45,369
You doing okay?
You've been in there a while.

435
00:17:45,371 --> 00:17:47,605
I'm fine. Be right out.

436
00:17:49,742 --> 00:17:52,710
Am I an American hero?

437
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:57,114
Well, that's
a good question, Jim.

438
00:17:57,116 --> 00:18:01,018
Don't you think once
an astronaut leaves the planet,

439
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:04,388
he's a hero to all the nations
of the Earth?

440
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:09,560
Okey dokey.

441
00:18:09,562 --> 00:18:11,203
I think I have time
for one more question.

442
