1
00:00:01,610 --> 00:00:05,880
My new book <i>The Hidden Reality</i>
takes on a grand question:

2
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:08,850
Is our universe
the only universe?

3
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:12,080
You see, there's a growing
belief among scientists like me

4
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:15,660
that ours may only be one
among many universes

5
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:17,720
populating a gigantic cosmos.

6
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:20,660
In <i>The Hidden Reality</i>,
I explore this possibility

7
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:23,600
without presuming any knowledge
of mathematics or physics

8
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:24,800
on the part of the reader.

9
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:28,100
Hysterical.

10
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:30,570
I'm glad you
talked me into this.

11
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:33,040
We work so hard, sometimes,
it's nice to goof off

12
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:35,740
- and do something silly.
- Agreed.

13
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:39,280
Wait till you hear how he dumbs down
Werner Heisenberg for the crowd.

14
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:41,300
You may actually believe
you're in a comedy club.

15
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:45,420
You can think about Heisenberg's
"Uncertainty Principle"

16
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:47,420
much like the special order menu

17
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:49,860
that you find in certain Chinese
restaurants, where you have

18
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:52,890
dishes in column A
and other dishes in column B,

19
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:55,030
and if you order the first dish
in column A,

20
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:57,230
you can't order the corresponding
dish in column B.

21
00:00:57,730 --> 00:00:59,800
That's sort of like the
"Uncertainly Principle."

22
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:03,000
♪ Ba-dum-bump. ♪

23
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,010
Say, I heard an interesting tidbit
about Howard and Bernadette.

24
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:10,140
Really, Amy? Gossip?

25
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:11,880
I'm disappointed in you.

26
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:13,180
Now, now.

27
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:16,250
Evolutionary biologist Robin Dunbar
has identified gossip

28
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:18,650
as an aid to social
bonding in large groups.

29
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:22,320
Forgive my language,
but "poppycock."

30
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:23,360
What if he's right?

31
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:26,760
And by not participating in gossip,
society breaks down into

32
00:01:26,830 --> 00:01:29,200
small feral bands of tattooed
motorcycle riders

33
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,540
fighting to the death over the
last few cans of tuna fish?

34
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:35,230
In the parlance
of the urban music scene,

35
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:37,870
"What's the 4-1-1"?

36
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:41,540
Bernadette is thinking about
breaking up with Howard.

37
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:44,380
I believe our nation's
tuna cans are safe.

38
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:47,610
Excuse me.
Dr. Greene, question?

39
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:49,480
Yes?

40
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:50,870
You've dedicated
your life's work

41
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:52,890
to educating
the general populace

42
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:55,420
about complex scientific ideas.

43
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:56,690
Yes, in part.

44
00:01:56,690 --> 00:01:58,220
Have you ever considered

45
00:01:58,230 --> 00:02:00,360
trying to do something useful?

46
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:05,200
Perhaps, reading to the elderly?

47
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:06,850
Excuse me?

48
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:10,440
Yeah, but not your books;
something they might enjoy.

49
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:14,170

- Nice shot.
- Thank you.

60
00:02:51,010 --> 00:02:55,080
My father taught me archery
as a child.

61
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:00,420
It's odd how the activity

62
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:03,420
brings back the smell
of Kmart bourbon.

63
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:07,660
- Perfect.
- I know.

64
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:10,200
What an elf
I would have made.

65
00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:12,830
Whoo.

66
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:14,000
What do you think you're doing?

67
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,540
Shooting at a target?

68
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:16,500
With what?

69
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:18,670
- An arrow.
- Really?

70
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:21,610
I didn't see you draw one
from your quiver.

71
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:23,680
I'm not going to do that,
Sheldon.

72
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,680
Leonard, the people at Nintendo
can only go so far

73
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:30,150
in helping us recreate
an actual athletic experience.

74
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:32,220
We have to do our part, too.

75
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:41,630
That was uncalled for,
but...

76
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:44,630
I'll play along... Ow!

77
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:51,210
I had an unusual experience
with Amy last night.

78
00:03:51,210 --> 00:03:54,480
Really? How could you tell?

79
00:03:56,380 --> 00:03:58,980
She was attempting
to engage me in gossip.

80
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:00,720
- Mm. You don't say.
- Yes.

81
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,650
I think prolonged exposure
to Penny

82
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:05,550
has turned her into a bit
of a Gabby Gertie.

83
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:07,290
So, what's the gossip?

84
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:09,390
Oh, please, I was just
pointing it out.

85
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:11,910
I have no desire to engage
in the activity.

86
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:13,330
Fine, don't tell me.

87
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:17,580
All right, get this.

88
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:21,270
Bernadette is thinking
about breaking up with Howard.

89
00:04:21,270 --> 00:04:22,600
Oh...

90
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:24,740
That's too bad.
I wonder what happened.

91
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:26,910
Mm, it's hard to say.
I can only speculate

92
00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:28,340
based on the data I collected

93
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:30,210
watching my parents' marriage
implode.

94
00:04:30,210 --> 00:04:33,630
In that case,
the woman dives into religion,

95
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:36,380
while the man dives
into a bottle-blonde bartender

96
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:39,970
who tries to buy my love
with action figures.

97
00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:41,920
Oop! Out of arrows.

98
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:56,940
Boy, you sure get your money's
worth out of these games.

99
00:04:58,970 --> 00:05:02,610
- Priya, can I come in?
- Sure.

100
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:05,450
Oh, God.

101
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:07,620
- What?
- It's okay.

102
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:10,590
You didn't know.
I'll take care of it.

103
00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:12,640
What-what did I do?

104
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:14,090
Sheldon doesn't allow flossing

105
00:05:14,090 --> 00:05:15,660
that close to the mirror.

106
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:16,760
You're kidding.

107
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:18,360
It's a splatter thing.

108
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,190
There's a little piece of tape
on the floor

109
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:22,130
you're supposed to stand behind.

110
00:05:22,130 --> 00:05:24,070
- That's madness.
- I know.

111
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:26,300
Just do it. There's a big
inspection coming up,

112
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:29,320
and I don't want to lose
my TV privileges.

113
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:31,440
You really need
to let me take a look

114
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,170
at that roommate agreement,
one of these days.

115
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:34,690
Mm, I don't know.

116
00:05:34,690 --> 00:05:36,860
I get a lawyer,
he gets a lawyer...

117
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:39,480
It's just easier
to stand behind the tape.

118
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:41,220
Oh, by the way,
a fellow at work

119
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:43,000
said I could use his
Dodger tickets this weekend.

120
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,290
- Does that sound like fun?
- Yeah!

121
00:05:45,290 --> 00:05:48,090
Dodgers are baseball,
right?

122
00:05:48,090 --> 00:05:50,160
You'll need to explain
the game to me.

123
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,590
Mm, it's complicated.

124
00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:53,660
But as I remember it,
the essentials are

125
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:57,000
"get chosen last, get hit
by the ball, cry, go home."

126
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,640
Well, regardless,
I've got four tickets.

127
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:03,140
And I was thinking we can bring
Bernadette and Howard.

128
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:06,610
She's really interesting,
and I bet I can get used to him.

129
00:06:06,610 --> 00:06:08,510
Well, it might not
be a great idea

130
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:10,950
- to invite those two.
- Why not?

131
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:12,770
Don't tell anybody
I told you,

132
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:14,780
but I heard she might
be breaking up with him.

133
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:16,650
Oh... too bad...

134
00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:19,040
Although I do know one person
for whom that's good news.

135
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,190
Really? Who?

136
00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:21,460
My brother.

137
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:22,820
He's got a big crush
on Bernadette.

138
00:06:26,130 --> 00:06:27,160
What?

139
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:29,260
You're kidding!

140
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:32,220
No. I found poems
he wrote about her.

141
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:33,630
Very disturbing.

142
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:37,840
"Oh, Bernadette,
please play my clarinet."

143
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:43,040
- Wow, that's hard to believe.
- Yes.

144
00:06:43,050 --> 00:06:44,910
And for years,
everyone in my family

145
00:06:44,910 --> 00:06:47,980
was convinced that <i>he</i> was
the clarinet enthusiast.

146
00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:51,740
Hmm. What's that
piece of tape?

147
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:55,520
Oh, that one doesn't
apply to you. You sit.

148
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:59,260
- Hey!
- Hey! How's it going?

149
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:01,400
Not too bad. Did you hear
about Howard and Bernadette?

150
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:03,360
'Course I heard about it.
How did you hear about it?

151
00:07:03,370 --> 00:07:05,200
I heard about it
from Sheldon.

152
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:07,250
- He got it from Amy.
- Oh, damn it.

153
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:09,200
I told Amy that in the
strictest confidence.

154
00:07:09,210 --> 00:07:12,370
Boy, some people are
such blabbermouths.

155
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:13,790
Well, whatever.

156
00:07:13,790 --> 00:07:15,180
I'm sure Bernadette
can do better.

157
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:18,750
Do you think a sexually ambivalent
Indian astrophysicist

158
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:21,430
with selective mutism
and alcohol issues is better than

159
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:24,800
a hundred-pound Jewish guy
who lives with his mom?

160
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:27,360
You are kidding.
Raj likes Bernadette?

161
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:30,940
I didn't say Raj.
Who said <i>Raj?</i>

162
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:32,690
Okay, give.

163
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:34,130
How do you know?
Did he tell you?

164
00:07:34,630 --> 00:07:36,480
- No.
- Well, then who?

165
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:38,650
I can't say...

166
00:07:38,650 --> 00:07:42,070
Priya told you.
What a little gossip.

167
00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:45,040
You know, not an attractive
quality in a woman, Leonard.

168
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:48,780
Not judging,
just my opinion.

169
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:50,750
Well, the point is,
if this got out,

170
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:52,950
it would destroy Howard
and Raj's friendship.

171
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:54,050
You don't have to worry.

172
00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:57,620
Unlike Amy and Priya,
I know how to keep a secret.

173
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:00,550
You're the one who told Amy
in the first place.

174
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,460
In confidence!

175
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:10,700
Hello, Mummy. Hello, Daddy.
How are you?

176
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:12,930
We're very rich
in a very poor country.

177
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:15,500
So, all in all,
can't complain.

178
00:08:16,510 --> 00:08:17,540
So, Priya,

179
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:20,240
how are enjoying
staying with your brother?

180
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,510
It's fine. But if
I'm going to stay

181
00:08:22,510 --> 00:08:23,680
in Los Angeles much longer,

182
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,080
I think I should
get my own place.

183
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:26,080
Why?

184
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,350
Is Rajesh not making you
feel comfortable?

185
00:08:28,350 --> 00:08:31,150
Rajesh, why aren't you making
your sister comfortable?

186
00:08:31,650 --> 00:08:33,720
I am making her comfortable.

187
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:34,960
Besides, she's not
sleeping here

188
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:37,190
half the time anyw...

189
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:39,790
What?

190
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:41,400
Where are you
sleeping, Priya?

191
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:43,230
It's a figure of
speech, Daddy.

192
00:08:43,230 --> 00:08:46,830
It means I-I work late.

193
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:48,900
Please tell me
you're not dating an American.

194
00:08:48,910 --> 00:08:50,540
I knew this would happen.

195
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:52,210
Rajesh, are you
letting your sister

196
00:08:52,210 --> 00:08:53,910
date that little Howard boy?

197
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:57,480
Now, hold on. If she
is dating an American,

198
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:58,980
that's not a bad way to go.

199
00:08:58,980 --> 00:08:59,950
He's Jewish.

200
00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:01,880
Those chaps are
very successful,

201
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:03,880
and they don't drink a lot.

202
00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:06,350
It-It doesn't matter.
Howard has a girlfriend.

203
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,860
- For now.
- What does that mean?

204
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:09,060
I'll tell you later.

205
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:11,130
Is something going on
with him and Bernadette?

206
00:09:11,130 --> 00:09:13,330
- Who's Bernadette?
- Doesn't sound Jewish.

207
00:09:13,330 --> 00:09:15,300
You can't tell by that.

208
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:18,930
Winona Ryder is Jewish.

209
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:20,970
Okay, we're getting
off the subject.

210
00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:22,740
Rajesh, I want
you to try harder

211
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:24,310
to make your sister
feel welcome.

212
00:09:24,310 --> 00:09:25,870
Thank you, Daddy.

213
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:27,580
Don't worry. Everything I have,
I share with her.

214
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:29,410
Including my friend Leon...

215
00:09:30,410 --> 00:09:32,650
Good night, Mummy.
Good night, Daddy.

216
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:37,180
Oh, my God,
I think you broke my toe!

217
00:09:37,690 --> 00:09:39,420
You should have kept
your mouth shut.

218
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:41,320
Fair enough.

219
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:43,890
Now, what's up with Clarinet...?
Bernadette!

220
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:51,170
I've been thinking about
Dr. Greene's efforts

221
00:09:51,170 --> 00:09:53,930
to make science palatable
for the masses.

222
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:55,500
Oh, yeah?
What about it?

223
00:09:56,210 --> 00:09:58,670
That's all. I've just
been thinking about it.

224
00:10:00,210 --> 00:10:02,980
Now, I'm thinking
about fractal equations.

225
00:10:04,650 --> 00:10:06,250
Now I'm thinking about

226
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:09,320
the origin of the phrase
"train of thought."

227
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:11,090
Now I'm thinking about trains.

228
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:15,720
Are you listening
to this guy?

229
00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:17,560
Hmm? Oh, I'm sorry.

230
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:18,860
I was somewhere else.

231
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:21,430
Lucky bastard.

232
00:10:22,930 --> 00:10:26,330
Now I'm thinking about Jell-O.

233
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:27,800
So what's up?

234
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:30,540
It's a Bernadette thing.

235
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:35,110
Oh, no. I hope
everything's okay.

236
00:10:37,410 --> 00:10:39,580
Whatever it is,
we're here for you.

237
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:41,670
You can tell us anything.

238
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:44,390
Yeah. Good or devastating.

239
00:10:45,950 --> 00:10:47,620
I'm gonna ask her to marry me.

240
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:50,060
- Marry you?   - What?
- Yeah.

241
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:53,630
I just need to figure out the
right time to pop the question.

242
00:10:53,630 --> 00:10:57,530
- Oh, I'd wait.
- No rush, no rush.

243
00:10:58,770 --> 00:11:01,020
Oh, great. It's my cousin David
about the ring.

244
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:03,200
Hey, David, what'd you find?

245
00:11:03,210 --> 00:11:04,910
Sure, a half a caret's fine.

246
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:08,980
Her freakishly small hands
make anything look big.

247
00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:12,210
It's one of the reasons
I love her.

248
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:18,150
Man, he's going
to be blindsided.

249
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:22,520
I know. It'll be awful.

250
00:11:22,530 --> 00:11:24,930
Why are you smiling?

251
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:28,000
Yeah, Raj, why?

252
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,800
Uh, a smile means something
different in my country.

253
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:36,740
You know, tears of joy,
smile of sadness.

254
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:39,040
India's a goofy place.

255
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:43,610
Oh, I'm back to trains.

256
00:11:43,610 --> 00:11:46,350
Woo-woo.

257
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:54,430
Did I tell you our lab got
a grant to study addiction?

258
00:11:54,430 --> 00:11:56,460
- No.
- Fascinating work.

259
00:11:56,470 --> 00:12:00,200
I recently trained a capuchin
monkey to smoke cigarettes.

260
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:02,070
Have you learned anything?

261
00:12:02,070 --> 00:12:05,540
Yes. He looks much cooler
than the non-smoking monkeys.

262
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:08,680
Although it's not
much of a contest.

263
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:12,310
The other monkeys just
sit around and masturbate.

264
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:20,360
If you don't mind, I'd like to stop
listening to you and start talking.

265
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:22,020
By all means.

266
00:12:22,030 --> 00:12:24,490
Howard has announced
his intention

267
00:12:24,490 --> 00:12:26,660
to propose marriage
to Bernadette.

268
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:28,200
I don't understand.

269
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:30,800
The original piece of gossip
indicated an impending breakup.

270
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:31,900
I know.

271
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:34,440
The group consensus
is that his proposal

272
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:38,310
will be met with an humiliating,
soul-crushing rejection.

273
00:12:38,310 --> 00:12:41,340
Everyone was set a-twitter.

274
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:45,080
Although oddly,
no one tweeted.

275
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:48,330
It's not surprising that
the story has captured

276
00:12:48,330 --> 00:12:50,250
the attention of our
little circle of friends.

277
00:12:50,290 --> 00:12:52,020
Are you familiar
with meme theory?

278
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:54,620
I'm familiar with
everything, but go on.

279
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:56,930
Meme theory suggests

280
00:12:56,930 --> 00:12:59,530
that items of gossip
are like living things

281
00:12:59,530 --> 00:13:02,330
that seek to reproduce
using humans as their host.

282
00:13:02,330 --> 00:13:05,570
I'm no stranger to
memetic epidemiology.

283
00:13:05,570 --> 00:13:07,440
At Johnson Elementary School,

284
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:12,240
the phrase "Shelly Cooper's
a smelly pooper" spread like wildfire.

285
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:14,880
I should think so.

286
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:16,610
That's gold.

287
00:13:19,950 --> 00:13:23,990
Your meme hypothesis
does intrigue me.

288
00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:26,050
How might we examine
this more closely?

289
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:29,920
Do you have any ethical qualms
regarding human experimentation?

290
00:13:29,930 --> 00:13:34,900
It's one of the few forms of interaction
with people that I don't find repellent.

291
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:38,370
We need to fabricate a
tantalizing piece of gossip.

292
00:13:38,370 --> 00:13:42,270
And a second non-tantalizing
piece to use as a control.

293
00:13:42,270 --> 00:13:44,640
Then we'll track its progress
through our social group

294
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:46,970
and interpret the results through
the competing academic prisms

295
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:51,080
of memetic theory,
algebraic gossip and epidemiology.

296
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:56,420
Look at you, getting me to
engage in the social sciences.

297
00:13:57,750 --> 00:14:01,490
You're a vixen,
Amy Farrah Fowler.

298
00:14:07,050 --> 00:14:08,430
Oh, hey, Amy. What's up?

299
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:10,570
Sheldon and I engaged
in sexual intercourse.

300
00:14:10,570 --> 00:14:13,600
In other news, I'm thinking of starting
an herb garden. Mum's the word. Gotta go.

301
00:14:19,140 --> 00:14:21,980
Oh, hey, Raj, what
are you doing here?

302
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:26,850
I just felt like drinking alone...
because I'm deep and dark.

303
00:14:26,850 --> 00:14:28,550
Uh-huh.

304
00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:30,050
So, uh, Howard's not here?

305
00:14:30,050 --> 00:14:32,890
No. It's just one of those
times when it's just you and me.

306
00:14:32,890 --> 00:14:34,990
Like when the three of us
went to the movies

307
00:14:34,990 --> 00:14:36,720
and you and I waited outside
the bathroom

308
00:14:36,730 --> 00:14:39,530
while Howard threw up
Red Vines and Cherry Coke.

309
00:14:40,530 --> 00:14:42,100
Do you remember that?

310
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:43,200
Yeah.

311
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,430
Me, too.

312
00:14:44,430 --> 00:14:46,200
Good times.

313
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:49,100
Alright, 16 wants
to order appetizers.

314
00:14:49,110 --> 00:14:51,740
- Oh, thanks.
- This was nice.

315
00:14:56,010 --> 00:14:57,260
What the hell are you doing?

316
00:14:57,260 --> 00:14:59,550
Howard is your best friend,
and that is his girlfriend.

317
00:14:59,550 --> 00:15:01,050
You should be
ashamed of yourself.

318
00:15:01,050 --> 00:15:02,520
I was when I came in,

319
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:05,020
but it's amazing what
liquor does to guilt.

320
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:07,320
Besides what you
might not know is...

321
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:09,690
Bernadette is planning on
breaking up with Howard.

322
00:15:09,690 --> 00:15:11,690
Well, I know that.
How do you know that?

323
00:15:11,690 --> 00:15:12,290
My sister told me.

324
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:15,200
Oh, that gossipy bitch!

325
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:17,570
No offense.

326
00:15:17,570 --> 00:15:18,620
None taken.

327
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:20,840
You should hear how
she talks about you.

328
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:24,510
Okay, listen, just because Howard
and Bernadette are having problems,

329
00:15:24,510 --> 00:15:26,540
does not mean you should
be here sniffing around.

330
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:27,760
What can I do?

331
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,910
I can't stop
thinking about her.

332
00:15:30,910 --> 00:15:33,130
All right, try
thinking about this...

333
00:15:33,130 --> 00:15:35,220
Sheldon and Amy had sex.

334
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:38,350
Shut your ass!

335
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:44,030
Yeah, it's true.
Amy told me.

336
00:15:44,030 --> 00:15:45,890
How did that even happen?

337
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:47,530
Did they know that's
what they were doing

338
00:15:47,530 --> 00:15:49,760
when they were doing it?

339
00:15:49,770 --> 00:15:52,170
I-I guess they just figured
it out at some point.

340
00:15:52,170 --> 00:15:53,500
Wow.

341
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:57,270
I can't believe old
Smelly Pooper finally got laid.

342
00:15:59,590 --> 00:16:02,210
- Hey.
- Hey.

343
00:16:02,210 --> 00:16:03,140
Hope you're hungry.

344
00:16:04,150 --> 00:16:05,610
Interesting.

345
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:07,880
A friendly sentiment
in this country,

346
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:11,490
cruel taunt in the Sudan.

347
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,960
It's a lesson in context.

348
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:17,060
Will Amy be
joining us for dinner?

349
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:18,590
Yes, I believe so.

350
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,060
Good, good.

351
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:23,260
Everything...
okay between you two?

352
00:16:28,470 --> 00:16:30,840
Yes.

353
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:33,270
Why do you ask?

354
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:35,410
No reason.

355
00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:37,610
I was just talking to Raj,

356
00:16:37,610 --> 00:16:41,320
and he mentioned what a lovely
glow she has these days.

357
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:45,890
Did he mean
as if she'd been out in the sun,

358
00:16:45,890 --> 00:16:49,460
tending an herb garden without
wearing a hat or sunblock?

359
00:16:51,490 --> 00:16:53,800
No.

360
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:57,000
That's not what he meant.

361
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,970
Well, we may never know.

362
00:16:59,970 --> 00:17:01,100
As my mother would say,

363
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:04,970
the Asians are
an inscrutable folk.

364
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:09,480
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have work to do.

365
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:12,010
Yeah, you do.
You dog, you.

366
00:17:18,390 --> 00:17:19,990
Did you get that?

367
00:17:19,990 --> 00:17:22,090
Every word.

368
00:17:22,090 --> 00:17:25,260
Our false gossip meme appears
to have reached node lambda.

369
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:26,360
This is moving faster
than we thought.

370
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:27,330
Agreed.

371
00:17:27,330 --> 00:17:28,430
It appears the rate

372
00:17:28,430 --> 00:17:29,600
of gossip transmission

373
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,670
is proportional
to the number of nodes squared.

374
00:17:31,670 --> 00:17:34,270
I must say, Amy,

375
00:17:34,270 --> 00:17:36,200
pretending to have
intercourse with you

376
00:17:36,210 --> 00:17:40,140
is giving me a great
deal of satisfaction.

377
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:43,180
Slow down, Sheldon.
I'm not quite there yet.

378
00:17:45,950 --> 00:17:47,850
- Pass the soy sauce.
- Sure.

379
00:17:48,850 --> 00:17:51,520
Bernadette just asked about
my sexual encounter with you.

380
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:54,060
The meme has reached
full penetration.

381
00:17:57,260 --> 00:17:59,130
Pun intended?

382
00:18:00,130 --> 00:18:02,260
No. Happy accident.

383
00:18:03,770 --> 00:18:05,370
This is remarkable.

384
00:18:05,370 --> 00:18:07,250
Took less than 24 hours.

385
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:09,100
I should let you know

386
00:18:09,110 --> 00:18:11,420
that she asked for details
about our dalliance.

387
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:13,070
Interesting.

388
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:15,710
So it went beyond the
mere fact of coitus

389
00:18:15,710 --> 00:18:19,310
to a "blow by blow,"
as it were.

390
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:21,430
Pun intended?

391
00:18:21,730 --> 00:18:24,750
I'm sorry. What pun?

392
00:18:26,150 --> 00:18:28,220
Not important.

393
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:31,890
I described your lovemaking
as "aloof, but effective."

394
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:35,600
I wish you hadn't done that.

395
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,370
That's going to make
me a chick magnet,

396
00:18:37,370 --> 00:18:41,070
and I'm so busy as it is.

397
00:18:41,070 --> 00:18:42,570
Hey, everybody,

398
00:18:42,570 --> 00:18:45,440
I got something I want
to ask Bernadette,

399
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:47,710
and I can't think
of a better time

400
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:49,340
than when I'm
with all my friends.

401
00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:50,610
Oh, hold on, Howard.

402
00:18:50,610 --> 00:18:52,980
There's lots of better times.

403
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:55,580
Leonard, please.
The man is talking.

404
00:18:55,590 --> 00:18:59,650
Let him get it out, and let
the chips fall where they may.

405
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:02,760
Thank you.

406
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:06,930
Bernadette Maryann
Rostenkowski...

407
00:19:06,930 --> 00:19:08,960
Oh, God.
What's happening?

408
00:19:09,970 --> 00:19:12,770
I know things haven't
been perfect with us,

409
00:19:12,770 --> 00:19:14,200
and we've had our problems,

410
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:16,500
but I just have to tell you,
from the moment I...

411
00:19:16,510 --> 00:19:19,070
Howard, let me just
stop you right here.

412
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:21,240
This is it.

413
00:19:22,610 --> 00:19:25,050
Yes.

414
00:19:25,050 --> 00:19:27,050
Yes, what?

415
00:19:27,050 --> 00:19:29,050
Yes, I will marry you.

416
00:19:29,050 --> 00:19:30,550
- You will?
- You will?

417
00:19:30,550 --> 00:19:31,950
I will.

418
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:34,420
I will!

419
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:36,060
Oh, I love you so much.

420
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:37,380
Oh, I love you, too.

421
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:38,960
Congratulations!

422
00:19:39,330 --> 00:19:40,830
Oh, it's so exciting.

423
00:19:45,070 --> 00:19:47,500
I wonder what
changed her mind.

424
00:19:47,510 --> 00:19:50,140
Perhaps your talk
of my sexual prowess

425
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:52,780
renewed her faith in love.

426
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:55,550
As good an explanation as any.

427
00:19:56,910 --> 00:19:59,120
That's great...

428
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:05,040
Oh, hey, Amy.

429
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:06,260
Bernadette just texted me.

430
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:07,530
Howard proposed?

431
00:20:07,570 --> 00:20:09,310
Yes, not important.
Just stopped by

432
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:10,770
to let you know I'm
getting orthotics.

433
00:20:10,770 --> 00:20:12,510
Also, I'm carrying
Sheldon's baby.

434
00:20:12,510 --> 00:20:13,730
Mum's the word.

435
00:20:19,550 --> 00:20:21,810
You're pregnant?!

436
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:26,870
Wow. Is there anything
on there about orthotics?

437
