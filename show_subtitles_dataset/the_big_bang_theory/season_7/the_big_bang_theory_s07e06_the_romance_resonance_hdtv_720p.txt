1
00:00:03,199 --> 00:00:04,199
What are you
working on?

2
00:00:04,201 --> 00:00:06,485
Can't talk.
In the zone.

3
00:00:06,487 --> 00:00:07,486
Do you know
what he's doing?

4
00:00:07,488 --> 00:00:09,121
Could be anything.

5
00:00:09,123 --> 00:00:10,622
Last time he was like this,
he figured out

6
00:00:10,624 --> 00:00:12,273
electron transport in graphene.

7
00:00:12,275 --> 00:00:14,109
The time before that,
he was making a list

8
00:00:14,111 --> 00:00:17,579
of who's allowed in his
tree fort if fe ever gets one.

9
00:00:17,581 --> 00:00:19,998
Still can't believe
I didn't make the cut.

10
00:00:20,883 --> 00:00:22,667
Uh, Sheldon,
you want to take a break?

11
00:00:22,669 --> 00:00:23,635
Your food's ready.

12
00:00:23,637 --> 00:00:25,003
No, no,
what are you doing?

13
00:00:25,005 --> 00:00:27,422
He's both happy and quiet.

14
00:00:27,424 --> 00:00:30,759
It's like seeing a unicorn
and Bigfoot at the same time.

15
00:00:31,594 --> 00:00:33,762
Sorry we're so late.

16
00:00:33,764 --> 00:00:35,013
Bernadette got
stuck at work.

17
00:00:35,015 --> 00:00:36,181
Great news!

18
00:00:36,183 --> 00:00:38,850
A raccoon virus just
crossed the species barrier

19
00:00:38,852 --> 00:00:41,636
and now can infect humans!

20
00:00:42,405 --> 00:00:44,272
Why is that great news?

21
00:00:44,274 --> 00:00:45,991
In the pharmaceutical business,
we have a saying:

22
00:00:45,993 --> 00:00:47,576
"Mo' infections, mo' money."

23
00:00:49,028 --> 00:00:50,311
Wait!

24
00:00:50,313 --> 00:00:51,446
Maybe you want to wash

25
00:00:51,448 --> 00:00:53,115
your little raccoon
hands first.

26
00:00:53,117 --> 00:00:54,149
Oh, calm down.

27
00:00:54,151 --> 00:00:56,034
If I had it,
I'd be dead already.

28
00:00:58,421 --> 00:01:00,005
Guys, listen up.

29
00:01:00,007 --> 00:01:01,373
Can't listen, zone.

30
00:01:02,324 --> 00:01:03,992
Also don't care.

31
00:01:03,994 --> 00:01:05,794
Next week is the anniversary

32
00:01:05,796 --> 00:01:07,345
of my first date
with Bernadette.

33
00:01:07,347 --> 00:01:09,598
Really don't care.

34
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:10,682
I want to do something special,

35
00:01:10,684 --> 00:01:12,834
and I was hoping
you guys could be a part of it.

36
00:01:12,836 --> 00:01:14,002
Aw, what horrible thing

37
00:01:14,004 --> 00:01:15,887
are you trying
to make up for?

38
00:01:15,889 --> 00:01:17,439
Just putting something
in the bank

39
00:01:17,441 --> 00:01:19,107
for what horrible thing
I do next.

40
00:01:19,109 --> 00:01:21,143
Ah.

41
00:01:21,145 --> 00:01:23,178
Look, she's gonna be back
any second, so here's the deal:

42
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:24,613
I'm writing a song,
and I was hoping

43
00:01:24,615 --> 00:01:26,314
we could all play it
for her together.

44
00:01:26,316 --> 00:01:27,616
Aw...
Oh, I love that.

45
00:01:27,618 --> 00:01:28,650
That is so beautiful.

46
00:01:28,652 --> 00:01:30,268
Sheldon?

47
00:01:31,187 --> 00:01:33,688

58
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:06,548
It's really sweet what Howard
wants to do for Bernadette.

59
00:02:06,550 --> 00:02:07,766
Yeah.

60
00:02:07,768 --> 00:02:09,434
Hey, how come you've never
done anything romantic

61
00:02:09,436 --> 00:02:11,603
to celebrate
our first date?

62
00:02:11,605 --> 00:02:14,189
Well, for starters, you've
broken up with me so many times,

63
00:02:14,191 --> 00:02:17,542
which first date
are we talking about?

64
00:02:17,544 --> 00:02:19,811
Ooh, somebody call
the burn ward.

65
00:02:21,697 --> 00:02:23,898
And back to the zone.

66
00:02:24,984 --> 00:02:27,769
And besides, I do romantic
things for you all the time.

67
00:02:27,771 --> 00:02:28,903
Can you even name

68
00:02:28,905 --> 00:02:30,705
one romantic thing
you've done for me?

69
00:02:30,707 --> 00:02:31,656
I can name tons.

70
00:02:31,658 --> 00:02:34,209
Sex doesn't count.
Oh.

71
00:02:34,211 --> 00:02:36,328
I know, what about
that bed-and-breakfast?

72
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:37,545
Well, I took you there.

73
00:02:37,547 --> 00:02:38,496
All you did was...

74
00:02:38,498 --> 00:02:40,999
I know what I did.

75
00:02:41,001 --> 00:02:43,918
I bet they had to throw
out that rocking chair.

76
00:02:45,788 --> 00:02:48,289
You know, I can be
romantic if I want to.

77
00:02:48,291 --> 00:02:49,591
It's fine.

78
00:02:49,593 --> 00:02:52,510
And also not true.

79
00:02:52,512 --> 00:02:54,396
Okay, just you
wait and see.

80
00:02:54,398 --> 00:02:56,564
I'm gonna romance
your freakin' ass off.

81
00:02:57,900 --> 00:02:59,150
That's beautiful.

82
00:02:59,152 --> 00:03:00,151
Is that Shakespeare?

83
00:03:00,153 --> 00:03:01,969
Sheldon?

84
00:03:01,971 --> 00:03:03,905
Zone.

85
00:03:05,074 --> 00:03:08,309
He'll figure it out when
he falls off the roof.

86
00:03:09,495 --> 00:03:12,030
Sheldon, I know
you're in the zone,

87
00:03:12,032 --> 00:03:13,915
but do you
want some tea?

88
00:03:18,070 --> 00:03:20,171
All right, I can't believe
I'm gonna say this,

89
00:03:20,173 --> 00:03:21,673
but you haven't
spoken in hours

90
00:03:21,675 --> 00:03:23,157
and I'm starting
to get worried.

91
00:03:23,159 --> 00:03:24,158
Please say something.

92
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:26,261
Leonard, prepare
to be humbled

93
00:03:26,263 --> 00:03:29,547
and weep at the glory
of my genius.

94
00:03:30,766 --> 00:03:32,767
Nope, it was better before.

95
00:03:34,103 --> 00:03:35,437
Look at it.

96
00:03:35,439 --> 00:03:39,274
I feel like my mind
just made a baby.

97
00:03:39,276 --> 00:03:41,559
And it's beautiful.

98
00:03:41,561 --> 00:03:43,010
It's not like human babies,

99
00:03:43,012 --> 00:03:44,963
which are loud
and covered in goop.

100
00:03:46,348 --> 00:03:48,015
Holy crap, Sheldon,

101
00:03:48,017 --> 00:03:49,667
did you just
figure out a method

102
00:03:49,669 --> 00:03:52,487
for synthesizing a new stable
super-heavy element?

103
00:03:52,489 --> 00:03:54,539
Did I?

104
00:03:54,541 --> 00:03:56,091
Well, that can't
be right.

105
00:03:56,093 --> 00:03:57,459
No one's ever done that before.

106
00:03:57,461 --> 00:03:59,127
Except me,
because I just did it!

107
00:03:59,129 --> 00:04:01,529
♪ Sheldon and
his brain-- yeah! ♪

108
00:04:01,531 --> 00:04:03,248
♪ Sheldon and his brain--
yeah! ♪

109
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:04,883
♪ Sheldon and
his brain-- yeah! ♪

110
00:04:04,885 --> 00:04:06,401
♪ Sheldon and
his brain-- yeah! ♪

111
00:04:06,403 --> 00:04:07,802
♪ Sheldon
and his brain... ♪

112
00:04:07,804 --> 00:04:09,838
Yeah, definitely better before.

113
00:04:11,057 --> 00:04:13,675
So I'm almost done writing
the song for Bernadette.

114
00:04:13,677 --> 00:04:15,042
Are you cool
playing the cello?

115
00:04:15,044 --> 00:04:17,896
If by "cool" you mean
"willing to," yes.

116
00:04:17,898 --> 00:04:19,848
If by "cool"
you mean "cool,"

117
00:04:19,850 --> 00:04:21,883
clearly you've never
seen me play the cello.

118
00:04:22,568 --> 00:04:24,519
Great.
Will you play the ukulele?

119
00:04:24,521 --> 00:04:27,405
Of course. I'd be happy
to shred it on my ax.

120
00:04:28,941 --> 00:04:31,860
Or you could just play
your tiny, ridiculous guitar.

121
00:04:34,697 --> 00:04:37,665
Fine. I will
melt her heart.

122
00:04:37,667 --> 00:04:40,067
And her face!

123
00:04:41,170 --> 00:04:43,037
Gentlemen.

124
00:04:43,039 --> 00:04:45,423
Uh, no doubt you heard about
my little breakthrough.

125
00:04:45,425 --> 00:04:47,342
Now, if your plan

126
00:04:47,344 --> 00:04:48,960
is to hoist me
on your shoulders

127
00:04:48,962 --> 00:04:51,245
and carry me around the
cafeteria, please refrain.

128
00:04:51,247 --> 00:04:52,547
I don't care
for heights,

129
00:04:52,549 --> 00:04:53,798
motion sickness

130
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:56,551
or the thought of your necks
touching my buttocks.

131
00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:00,472
Seriously,
congratulations, Sheldon.

132
00:05:00,474 --> 00:05:02,023
Yeah, I read
your paper online.

133
00:05:02,025 --> 00:05:04,309
That technique for creating
a new heavy element is inspired.

134
00:05:04,311 --> 00:05:05,310
Oh, well, thank you.

135
00:05:05,312 --> 00:05:06,444
Believe it or not,

136
00:05:06,446 --> 00:05:08,530
I just learned
a Chinese research team

137
00:05:08,532 --> 00:05:10,281
at the Hubei Institute
for Nuclear Physics

138
00:05:10,283 --> 00:05:12,150
ran a test on a cyclotron,

139
00:05:12,152 --> 00:05:14,152
and the results were
extremely promising.

140
00:05:14,154 --> 00:05:16,121
Sheldon,
that's incredible.

141
00:05:16,123 --> 00:05:18,272
Yeah, I know! They called it
the greatest thing

142
00:05:18,274 --> 00:05:20,208
since the Communist party.

143
00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:22,293
Although I'm pretty sure that

144
00:05:22,295 --> 00:05:24,045
the Communist party
made them say that.

145
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,915
I like China.

146
00:05:26,917 --> 00:05:29,283
See, they know how to keep
people in line.

147
00:05:30,669 --> 00:05:32,119
So, what happens next?

148
00:05:32,121 --> 00:05:35,089
Oh, more testing,
more success, more fame.

149
00:05:35,091 --> 00:05:36,141
But don't worry,

150
00:05:36,143 --> 00:05:39,093
I will remain the same
down-to-earth humble Joe

151
00:05:39,095 --> 00:05:41,179
I've always been.

152
00:05:41,181 --> 00:05:42,296
- Good to know.
- Yeah.

153
00:05:42,298 --> 00:05:43,398
Now give me
that cookie;

154
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:46,351
I discovered an element.

155
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,721
Thank you so much
for coming.

156
00:05:49,723 --> 00:05:51,489
You called the right person.

157
00:05:51,491 --> 00:05:52,941
I believe I have
the perfect romantic evening

158
00:05:52,943 --> 00:05:53,992
for you to give Leonard.

159
00:05:53,994 --> 00:05:55,076
Okay, good,
'cause I've been

160
00:05:55,078 --> 00:05:56,694
really struggling
with this.

161
00:05:56,696 --> 00:05:57,946
As I'm sure you're aware,

162
00:05:57,948 --> 00:06:00,615
the quickest way to a man's
heart is through his...

163
00:06:00,617 --> 00:06:03,618
Pants, but Leonard says
sex doesn't count.

164
00:06:04,453 --> 00:06:05,753
Oh. You poor thing.

165
00:06:05,755 --> 00:06:07,488
You have one arrow
in your quiver,

166
00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:09,073
and you just can't use it.

167
00:06:10,459 --> 00:06:13,160
Fortunately, another
pathway to a man's heart

168
00:06:13,162 --> 00:06:15,763
is through his stomach.

169
00:06:15,765 --> 00:06:17,265
I don't know if
I want to cook for him;

170
00:06:17,267 --> 00:06:18,266
he's kind of a picky eater.

171
00:06:18,268 --> 00:06:19,684
I mean,
"It's too salty.

172
00:06:19,686 --> 00:06:21,052
"It's too dry.

173
00:06:21,054 --> 00:06:24,005
It's too burnt and frozen
at the same time."

174
00:06:24,974 --> 00:06:25,974
Wait, come on,

175
00:06:25,976 --> 00:06:27,392
what else would
sweep you off your feet?

176
00:06:27,394 --> 00:06:29,644
Well, I've always had
this fantasy

177
00:06:29,646 --> 00:06:30,945
that involves dancing.

178
00:06:30,947 --> 00:06:33,514
The sexual chemistry

179
00:06:33,516 --> 00:06:36,284
between my partner and me
is electric.

180
00:06:36,286 --> 00:06:37,635
But boy, oh, boy,

181
00:06:37,637 --> 00:06:38,920
does my father not approve

182
00:06:38,922 --> 00:06:41,856
until he sees us
in the big dance competition.

183
00:06:42,925 --> 00:06:44,993
Okay, that's just
the plot for <i>Dirty Dancing.</i>

184
00:06:46,829 --> 00:06:48,213
What else would you love?

185
00:06:48,215 --> 00:06:50,999
Other than being lifted over
Patrick Swayze's head.

186
00:06:51,001 --> 00:06:54,035
Oh! Oh, uh, you could, uh,
stand outside his window

187
00:06:54,037 --> 00:06:56,988
with a boom box in the air.

188
00:06:59,108 --> 00:07:01,209
That's from <i>Say Anything.</i>

189
00:07:01,211 --> 00:07:04,846
Look, I'm a lonely guy;
I watch a lot of movies.

190
00:07:06,049 --> 00:07:09,000
Look, Penny, if you truly
want to be romantic,

191
00:07:09,002 --> 00:07:10,568
it needs to come
from you.

192
00:07:10,570 --> 00:07:12,770
I get that,
but why is this so hard?

193
00:07:12,772 --> 00:07:14,772
Well, you've probably
never had to do this stuff

194
00:07:14,774 --> 00:07:15,907
'cause you're
young and beautiful

195
00:07:15,909 --> 00:07:17,775
and men have always thrown
themselves at you.

196
00:07:17,777 --> 00:07:19,777
Hmm.

197
00:07:19,779 --> 00:07:21,713
Yeah, I'm trying
to be sad about that.

198
00:07:21,715 --> 00:07:23,114
I can't.

199
00:07:27,453 --> 00:07:29,537
Let's see,
what's next?

200
00:07:29,539 --> 00:07:30,505
Okay! Here.

201
00:07:30,507 --> 00:07:32,423
This is
the Magic Marker

202
00:07:32,425 --> 00:07:34,676
I was using when
I made the discovery.

203
00:07:36,244 --> 00:07:38,846
I don't think the Smithsonian's
gonna want your marker.

204
00:07:38,848 --> 00:07:42,467
And that's why you're not
on a list for my tree fort.

205
00:07:46,089 --> 00:07:48,139
Ooh, guess who's
getting an article

206
00:07:48,141 --> 00:07:49,924
written about him
in <i>Physics Today?</i>

207
00:07:49,926 --> 00:07:51,476
I'll give you a hint.

208
00:07:51,478 --> 00:07:54,729
You measured the diameter of
his suspicious mole yesterday.

209
00:07:56,615 --> 00:07:58,416
Sheldon, I'm so proud of you.

210
00:07:58,418 --> 00:07:59,433
Well, you should be.

211
00:07:59,435 --> 00:08:01,486
My discovery is
spreading like wildfire.

212
00:08:01,488 --> 00:08:03,237
Unlike my mole,
which is holding steady

213
00:08:03,239 --> 00:08:05,206
at the size of
a navy bean.

214
00:08:06,875 --> 00:08:08,126
What's next?

215
00:08:08,128 --> 00:08:09,994
This is
the very copy

216
00:08:09,996 --> 00:08:11,829
of <i>The Handbook of</i>
<i>Chemistry and Physics</i>

217
00:08:11,831 --> 00:08:13,831
in which I looked up
the reaction rates

218
00:08:13,833 --> 00:08:16,050
of mendelevium and...

219
00:08:17,736 --> 00:08:19,687
And what?
No.

220
00:08:20,756 --> 00:08:22,657
No, no, no, no.

221
00:08:22,659 --> 00:08:23,675
What's wrong?

222
00:08:25,928 --> 00:08:27,679
I've made a horrible mistake.

223
00:08:27,681 --> 00:08:28,846
What are you talking about?

224
00:08:28,848 --> 00:08:31,632
This table--
it's in square centimeters.

225
00:08:31,634 --> 00:08:33,518
I read it as square meters.

226
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:35,069
You know what that means?

227
00:08:35,071 --> 00:08:37,638
That Americans can't handle
the metric system?

228
00:08:39,191 --> 00:08:43,027
Amy, I was off by
a factor of 10,000.

229
00:08:43,029 --> 00:08:45,913
But the Chinese team
found the element.

230
00:08:45,915 --> 00:08:46,998
Yeah, well, they shouldn't have.

231
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,449
My calculations were wrong.

232
00:08:48,451 --> 00:08:49,984
There must be some resonance

233
00:08:49,986 --> 00:08:51,703
between the elements
I didn't know about.

234
00:08:51,705 --> 00:08:53,371
So you just got lucky?

235
00:08:53,373 --> 00:08:55,656
Sheldon Cooper
does not get lucky!

236
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:00,294
You and me both, brother.

237
00:09:01,213 --> 00:09:02,463
It doesn't matter.

238
00:09:02,465 --> 00:09:04,498
The element was found
because of you,

239
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:05,633
and that's groundbreaking.

240
00:09:05,635 --> 00:09:06,718
What matters is

241
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,186
the greatest
scientific achievement

242
00:09:08,188 --> 00:09:10,337
of my life is
based on a blunder.

243
00:09:10,339 --> 00:09:13,274
I'm not a genius,
I'm a fraud.

244
00:09:14,059 --> 00:09:15,643
You know, Sheldon,
in neuroscience,

245
00:09:15,645 --> 00:09:17,945
we're forever finding something
in one part of the brain

246
00:09:17,947 --> 00:09:19,480
that we thought was
someplace else.

247
00:09:19,482 --> 00:09:20,782
Oh, great.

248
00:09:20,784 --> 00:09:22,533
Now I'm worse
than a fraud.

249
00:09:22,535 --> 00:09:24,285
I'm practically
a biologist.

250
00:09:34,134 --> 00:09:36,302
You got to stop beating
yourself up over this.

251
00:09:36,304 --> 00:09:39,222
I mean, you made a mistake,
but it was a happy mistake.

252
00:09:39,224 --> 00:09:40,924
There's nothing happy about it.

253
00:09:40,926 --> 00:09:43,860
I'm being given credit
that I don't deserve.

254
00:09:43,862 --> 00:09:46,830
Oh, people get things
they don't deserve all the time.

255
00:09:46,832 --> 00:09:49,432
Look at me with you.

256
00:09:49,434 --> 00:09:51,150
No, Leonard,
this is going to haunt me

257
00:09:51,152 --> 00:09:52,385
for the rest of my life.

258
00:09:52,387 --> 00:09:54,070
Every science classroom,

259
00:09:54,072 --> 00:09:56,739
every periodic table,
every textbook--

260
00:09:56,741 --> 00:09:59,576
this mistake will be
staring back at me

261
00:09:59,578 --> 00:10:03,446
Like that time you let
Koothrappali wax your eyebrows.

262
00:10:04,665 --> 00:10:07,617
I've got to find a way
to stop this thing.

263
00:10:07,619 --> 00:10:09,235
Buddy, I don't
think you can.

264
00:10:09,237 --> 00:10:11,287
I mean, once it's out there,
it's out there.

265
00:10:11,289 --> 00:10:15,508
This thing is like the science
equivalent of a sex tape.

266
00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:18,011
You know, frankly,
I'd prefer a sex tape.

267
00:10:18,013 --> 00:10:19,846
You don't know
what a sex tape is, do you?

268
00:10:19,848 --> 00:10:21,247
No.

269
00:10:23,684 --> 00:10:25,635
Make sure you guys get
to the restaurant by 8:00.

270
00:10:25,637 --> 00:10:27,086
Bernadette's meeting
me there at 8:30

271
00:10:27,088 --> 00:10:29,188
and I don't want to blow the surprise.
We'll be there.

272
00:10:29,190 --> 00:10:30,390
Got it.

273
00:10:30,392 --> 00:10:32,692
Now, uh, I have a question
about the song.

274
00:10:32,694 --> 00:10:34,143
I was thinking
at some point

275
00:10:34,145 --> 00:10:36,596
I could bust out
a little rap.

276
00:10:37,448 --> 00:10:40,433
N-N-N-No...

277
00:10:43,737 --> 00:10:46,272
Come on, come on, you
haven't even heard it yet.

278
00:10:46,274 --> 00:10:47,824
Leonard,
give me a beat.

279
00:10:47,826 --> 00:10:49,626
I will not.

280
00:10:50,944 --> 00:10:52,078
Please?

281
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:53,913
No, I want this
to be romantic.

282
00:10:53,915 --> 00:10:54,947
It will be!

283
00:10:54,949 --> 00:10:56,466
I don't call
anyone a ho,

284
00:10:56,468 --> 00:10:58,801
and the only time I use
the phrase "my bitch,"

285
00:10:58,803 --> 00:11:01,671
I'm referring to you.

286
00:11:01,673 --> 00:11:03,590
There he is!

287
00:11:06,226 --> 00:11:07,460
Stop it.

288
00:11:07,462 --> 00:11:08,961
Stop celebrating me!

289
00:11:08,963 --> 00:11:10,680
Woo!

290
00:11:10,682 --> 00:11:12,565
And no woos!

291
00:11:12,567 --> 00:11:14,634
Oh, not you, Dr. Woo.
You're fine.

292
00:11:17,938 --> 00:11:19,739
I want you all to know

293
00:11:19,741 --> 00:11:22,108
that you have no reason
to applaud me.

294
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:24,360
My so-called
breakthrough

295
00:11:24,362 --> 00:11:25,912
wasn't the result of my genius.

296
00:11:25,914 --> 00:11:28,331
It was nothing more than
a boneheaded mistake.

297
00:11:28,333 --> 00:11:30,149
So please refrain

298
00:11:30,151 --> 00:11:32,168
from praising me for it
in the future.

299
00:11:32,170 --> 00:11:33,286
Wh... I don't understand.

300
00:11:33,288 --> 00:11:34,504
They didn't find the element?

301
00:11:34,506 --> 00:11:36,656
Oh, no, they found the element.

302
00:11:36,658 --> 00:11:39,158
No, no, stop it!

303
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:40,326
I don't need
to take this admiration

304
00:11:40,328 --> 00:11:42,345
from the likes
of you people!

305
00:11:42,347 --> 00:11:44,964
How do I make them
stop loving me?

306
00:11:44,966 --> 00:11:47,216
Invite them
to live with us.

307
00:11:51,222 --> 00:11:53,172
Boy, Bernadette is
gonna love this.

308
00:11:53,174 --> 00:11:55,058
Yeah. It must be nice
to have someone

309
00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:57,276
do something
so romantic.

310
00:11:57,278 --> 00:11:59,512
Okay, you know
what's not romantic?

311
00:11:59,514 --> 00:12:01,180
Rubbing it in someone's face.

312
00:12:01,182 --> 00:12:02,281
Actually, it can be,

313
00:12:02,283 --> 00:12:04,651
but I told you
sex doesn't count.

314
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,788
I'm getting worried
about Bernadette.

315
00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:11,357
I'm gonna call
and check on her.

316
00:12:11,359 --> 00:12:13,042
The National Science Foundation

317
00:12:13,044 --> 00:12:14,911
wants to give me
a substantial grant.

318
00:12:14,913 --> 00:12:16,362
Oh, that's a big deal.

319
00:12:16,364 --> 00:12:17,380
I know.

320
00:12:17,382 --> 00:12:20,333
When will this
nightmare end?

321
00:12:20,335 --> 00:12:22,552
Hey, I get that you feel bad
about all the attention,

322
00:12:22,554 --> 00:12:24,387
but still,
what you did is amazing.

323
00:12:24,389 --> 00:12:25,755
We're really proud of you.

324
00:12:25,757 --> 00:12:26,806
I'm not.

325
00:12:27,675 --> 00:12:28,874
You're not?

326
00:12:28,876 --> 00:12:31,561
Sheldon, I've been
thinking about it,

327
00:12:31,563 --> 00:12:32,878
and you're right.

328
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,347
You don't deserve
any credit.

329
00:12:34,349 --> 00:12:37,550
All you did was misread
some numbers on a table.

330
00:12:37,552 --> 00:12:39,385
A very easy table, too.

331
00:12:39,387 --> 00:12:42,772
Honestly, I'm
embarrassed for you.

332
00:12:44,858 --> 00:12:47,226
That's the most romantic thing
I've ever heard.

333
00:12:48,862 --> 00:12:52,298
Damn it, everyone's better
at this than me.

334
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:54,333
Congratulations,
Dr. Fowler.

335
00:12:54,335 --> 00:12:56,019
You just made the fort.

336
00:12:58,205 --> 00:13:01,507
Guys, there w-was
an accident at Bernie's lab.

337
00:13:01,509 --> 00:13:03,292
Oh, my God,
is she okay?

338
00:13:03,294 --> 00:13:05,545
Yeah, but she's at
the hospital in quarantine.

339
00:13:05,547 --> 00:13:06,596
What?
Poor Bernadette.

340
00:13:06,598 --> 00:13:07,880
Oh, no.

341
00:13:07,882 --> 00:13:11,050
I hate to pile on the bad news,
but I just got a raise.

342
00:13:19,476 --> 00:13:22,361
Oh, my God, Bernie,
what happened?

343
00:13:22,363 --> 00:13:24,597
Well, let's just say
the next time you move

344
00:13:24,599 --> 00:13:29,035
a dozen vials of raccoon virus
to the fridge, make two trips.

345
00:13:29,953 --> 00:13:31,554
You're sure you're okay?

346
00:13:31,556 --> 00:13:32,955
Yeah, it's just a precaution.

347
00:13:32,957 --> 00:13:34,240
If there was a problem,

348
00:13:34,242 --> 00:13:36,993
I'd be throwing up
out of my eyeballs by now.

349
00:13:38,278 --> 00:13:39,662
Sorry I messed up our date.

350
00:13:39,664 --> 00:13:40,830
, don't worry
about it.

351
00:13:40,832 --> 00:13:42,749
I brought the
date here.

352
00:13:42,751 --> 00:13:45,551

00:16:47,468 --> 00:16:50,987
this is the best Top Ramen
you've ever made.

414
00:16:50,989 --> 00:16:52,822
I discovered
a secret ingredient:

415
00:16:52,824 --> 00:16:54,740
the flavor packet.

416
00:16:55,325 --> 00:16:58,277
That sucker is well named.

417
00:16:59,479 --> 00:17:01,664
All right, lover boy.

418
00:17:01,666 --> 00:17:04,166
Get ready, 'cause there is
a crap storm of romance

419
00:17:04,168 --> 00:17:06,085
coming your way.

420
00:17:06,087 --> 00:17:08,487
Stop it,
you're gonna make me cry.

421
00:17:11,292 --> 00:17:13,259
All right. You seem
pretty confident.

422
00:17:13,261 --> 00:17:14,660
Oh, I am.

423
00:17:14,662 --> 00:17:18,297
Maybe if you follow this trail,

424
00:17:18,299 --> 00:17:20,182
you'll see why.

425
00:17:20,184 --> 00:17:21,817
Oh, rose petals.

426
00:17:21,819 --> 00:17:22,785
Yes.

427
00:17:22,787 --> 00:17:24,053
The most beautiful

428
00:17:24,055 --> 00:17:26,338
and shockingly expensive
of all the flowers.

429
00:17:29,342 --> 00:17:30,559
You made the bed?

430
00:17:30,561 --> 00:17:33,529
You really are pulling
out all the stops.

431
00:17:33,531 --> 00:17:36,032
Okay, I gave this
a lot of thought,

432
00:17:36,034 --> 00:17:38,401
and I finally found
something to show you

433
00:17:38,403 --> 00:17:40,369
how much I love you.

434
00:17:44,791 --> 00:17:46,876
Oh, wow.

435
00:17:46,878 --> 00:17:48,127
It's a first edition of

436
00:17:48,129 --> 00:17:49,879
<i>Hitchhiker's Guide</i>
<i>to the Galaxy.</i>

437
00:17:49,881 --> 00:17:53,049
I remember it was
your favorite book growing up.

438
00:17:53,884 --> 00:17:55,134
This is great.

439
00:17:55,136 --> 00:17:56,502
It... thank you.

440
00:17:56,504 --> 00:17:58,054
It's... so much.

441
00:17:58,056 --> 00:18:00,806
What?

442
00:18:00,808 --> 00:18:02,925
Nothing. I love it.
No.

443
00:18:02,927 --> 00:18:04,260
Something's going on.
What's wrong with it?

444
00:18:04,262 --> 00:18:06,145
I remember you saying
how great it would be

445
00:18:06,147 --> 00:18:07,263
to have a first edition.

446
00:18:07,265 --> 00:18:09,148
It's true, I-I did.

447
00:18:09,150 --> 00:18:10,483
I did say that...

448
00:18:10,485 --> 00:18:13,152
when we were at the used
bookstore together

449
00:18:13,154 --> 00:18:16,655
and I saw the first
edition and I bought it.

450
00:18:17,824 --> 00:18:21,193
Oh, my God,
I am the worst!

451
00:18:21,195 --> 00:18:22,912
No, no, it's okay.
It's really thoughtful.

452
00:18:22,914 --> 00:18:25,564
No, it's not! I mean...

453
00:18:25,566 --> 00:18:28,400
What's thoughtful
is everything you do.

454
00:18:29,753 --> 00:18:32,038
Here, you know what?
Look at this.

455
00:18:34,708 --> 00:18:36,509
Look, here's the...
the plane ticket you bought me

456
00:18:36,511 --> 00:18:38,711
when I was too poor
to go home for the holidays.

457
00:18:38,713 --> 00:18:41,430
And the rose you left
on my windshield...

458
00:18:41,432 --> 00:18:43,632
just because.

459
00:18:43,634 --> 00:18:45,551
Here's the-the thank-you
letter you wrote me

460
00:18:45,553 --> 00:18:47,553
after the first time
I slept with you.

461
00:18:48,922 --> 00:18:51,891
All 11 pages of it.

462
00:18:52,859 --> 00:18:55,895
Can't believe
you saved all this stuff.

463
00:18:56,763 --> 00:18:58,280
Of course I did.

464
00:18:58,282 --> 00:18:59,782
It's you.

465
00:19:00,617 --> 00:19:02,568
Come here.

466
00:19:05,038 --> 00:19:06,238
Oh.

467
00:19:07,991 --> 00:19:10,459
Is that
a pregnancy test?

468
00:19:10,461 --> 00:19:11,827
Oh, yeah,
just the first one.

469
00:19:11,829 --> 00:19:13,295
I didn't save them all.

470
00:19:21,978 --> 00:19:25,614
I can't believe I read
this table wrong.

471
00:19:25,616 --> 00:19:28,467
I blame you.

472
00:19:28,469 --> 00:19:30,752
Me? What did I do?

473
00:19:30,754 --> 00:19:32,204
You distract me.

474
00:19:32,206 --> 00:19:35,040
I've been distracted since
the moment I met you.

475
00:19:35,875 --> 00:19:37,626
Sorry.

476
00:19:37,628 --> 00:19:38,794
Well, you should be.

477
00:19:38,796 --> 00:19:40,429
Because all I
can think about

478
00:19:40,431 --> 00:19:43,098
is how much I want
to kiss you.

479
00:19:45,435 --> 00:19:48,553
And not just on the cheek,
but on the mouth.

480
00:19:51,891 --> 00:19:54,109
Like mommies
and daddies do.

481
00:19:57,447 --> 00:19:59,698
Oh, Sheldon.

482
00:20:02,902 --> 00:20:05,120
<i>Amy?</i>

483
00:20:07,573 --> 00:20:10,125
Amy.

484
00:20:10,127 --> 00:20:11,943
Did you hear
what I said?

485
00:20:11,945 --> 00:20:13,345
Can't talk, in the zone.
