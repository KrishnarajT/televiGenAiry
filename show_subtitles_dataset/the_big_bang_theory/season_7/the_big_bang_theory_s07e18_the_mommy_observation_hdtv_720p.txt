1
00:00:03,022 --> 00:00:04,863
Should you really be
sitting in Sheldon's spot?

2
00:00:06,259 --> 00:00:08,193
He's in Texas.
He'll never know.

3
00:00:08,195 --> 00:00:09,961
I wouldn't be
so sure about that.

4
00:00:09,963 --> 00:00:11,563
Yeah, he has
a very sensitive butt.

5
00:00:14,133 --> 00:00:15,433
Well, it's true.

6
00:00:15,435 --> 00:00:18,837
Once I saw him sit on a bunch
of loose change and add it up.

7
00:00:20,306 --> 00:00:21,439
Have you heard from Howard?

8
00:00:21,441 --> 00:00:23,675
I did.
His talk at NASA went great.

9
00:00:23,677 --> 00:00:24,909
Sheldon didn't heckle him?

10
00:00:24,911 --> 00:00:26,578
No, in fact, he was
so well-behaved,

11
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:28,279
Howie bought him
a Buzz Aldrin bobble head

12
00:00:28,281 --> 00:00:29,581
and astronaut ice cream.

13
00:00:30,817 --> 00:00:32,183
Hey, guys.

14
00:00:32,185 --> 00:00:33,485
Oh, hi. - Hi, Stuart.
Hey, Stuart!

15
00:00:33,487 --> 00:00:35,353
How's it going?
Good.

16
00:00:35,355 --> 00:00:37,989
Sheldon's out of town,
so we can do whatever we want.

17
00:00:37,991 --> 00:00:40,125
We even ordered from
the Thai place he doesn't like.

18
00:00:40,127 --> 00:00:41,259
Oh, how is it?

19
00:00:41,261 --> 00:00:43,294
Disgusting. Do not tell him.

20
00:00:44,296 --> 00:00:45,764
What do you guys want
to do tonight?

21
00:00:45,766 --> 00:00:46,831
I don't know.

22
00:00:46,833 --> 00:00:48,400
Well, I told Howie
if I wasn't busy,

23
00:00:48,402 --> 00:00:50,001
I'd spend the night
at his mom's.

24
00:00:50,003 --> 00:00:52,270
So for God's sake,
think of something.

25
00:00:54,841 --> 00:00:56,141
Stuart?

26
00:00:56,143 --> 00:00:57,175
Are you okay?

27
00:00:57,177 --> 00:00:59,544
No, I don't feel so...

28
00:00:59,546 --> 00:01:01,212
Oh, Stuart?
Stuart?

29
00:01:01,214 --> 00:01:03,114
Oh, my God,
you guys need to do something!

30
00:01:03,116 --> 00:01:05,183
Stuart?
Calling 911.

31
00:01:05,185 --> 00:01:07,318
Well, it's too late.
What do you mean it's too late?

32
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:10,555
He's been murdered
by someone in this room.

33
00:01:12,092 --> 00:01:14,459
Oh, my God.
Oh, come on!

34
00:01:14,461 --> 00:01:15,994
Welcome to another classic

35
00:01:15,996 --> 00:01:19,831
Koothrappali
murder mystery dinner.

36
00:01:19,833 --> 00:01:20,899
I'm leaving.

37
00:01:20,901 --> 00:01:23,301
You can't leave.

38
00:01:23,303 --> 00:01:24,969
You're a suspect in
the mysterious murder

39
00:01:24,971 --> 00:01:27,005
of Stuart Bloom.

40
00:01:29,176 --> 00:01:31,576
I didn't know his
last name was Bloom.

41
00:01:31,578 --> 00:01:33,945
Yeah, it's Bloom.

42
00:01:33,947 --> 00:01:35,180
Are you really gonna
lie on the floor

43
00:01:35,182 --> 00:01:36,548
and pretend
to be dead all night?

44
00:01:36,550 --> 00:01:38,750

55
00:02:09,617 --> 00:02:11,885
Are you gonna make us pretend
to be a bunch of lame characters

56
00:02:11,887 --> 00:02:13,587
with silly accents?

57
00:02:13,589 --> 00:02:16,556
"Lame characters
with silly ac..."

58
00:02:16,558 --> 00:02:19,259
What kind of actress are you?

59
00:02:21,362 --> 00:02:22,629
You're right, I'm sorry.

60
00:02:22,631 --> 00:02:25,132
It... sounds like fun.
Thank you.

61
00:02:25,134 --> 00:02:26,867
That kind of actress.
This sucks!

62
00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:29,937
Come on, guys.

63
00:02:29,939 --> 00:02:31,104
Raj put a lot of
effort into this.

64
00:02:31,106 --> 00:02:32,139
And that's great.

65
00:02:32,141 --> 00:02:35,442
It's not sad, it's great.

66
00:02:35,444 --> 00:02:37,377
I think it might be fun
to be someone else tonight.

67
00:02:37,379 --> 00:02:39,012
Actually, you're all just
gonna be yourselves.

68
00:02:39,014 --> 00:02:40,814
Oh... ugh.

69
00:02:42,183 --> 00:02:43,617
All right,
if I'm doing this,

70
00:02:43,619 --> 00:02:45,552
I'm playing to win,
so just to be clear:

71
00:02:45,554 --> 00:02:47,955
If we're ourselves, that means
one of us killed Stuart?

72
00:02:47,957 --> 00:02:49,056
Very good, Bernadette.

73
00:02:49,058 --> 00:02:51,591
You are a regular
Byomkesh Bakshi.

74
00:02:51,593 --> 00:02:54,795
What is that, like,
the Indian Sherlock Holmes?

75
00:02:54,797 --> 00:02:58,699
Or is Sherlock Holmes
the English Byomkesh Bakshi?

76
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:02,002
According to Wikipedia,
Sherlock Holmes came first.

77
00:03:02,004 --> 00:03:04,871
Great, everyone's
a Byomkesh Bakshi.

78
00:03:04,873 --> 00:03:06,907
Now... here are

79
00:03:06,909 --> 00:03:09,309
some secret facts

80
00:03:09,311 --> 00:03:10,644
about each of you,

81
00:03:10,646 --> 00:03:13,580
including whether
you are the murderer.

82
00:03:13,582 --> 00:03:14,948
Throughout the game, feel free

83
00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:17,384
to ask each other questions
to uncover clues.

84
00:03:17,386 --> 00:03:18,919
Got it. Hey...

85
00:03:18,921 --> 00:03:21,221
who's the murderer?

86
00:03:22,490 --> 00:03:25,225
Any question but that.

87
00:03:25,227 --> 00:03:27,227
Sorry. Hey...

88
00:03:27,229 --> 00:03:30,063
who's <i>not</i> the murderer?

89
00:03:31,199 --> 00:03:34,735
Bernadette, can you not stand
so close to me?

90
00:03:34,737 --> 00:03:35,736
What do you care? You're dead.

91
00:03:35,738 --> 00:03:36,937
Suit yourself.

92
00:03:36,939 --> 00:03:39,639
But I can kind of...
see up your skirt.

93
00:03:48,149 --> 00:03:50,550
Thank you
for my bobble head.

94
00:03:50,552 --> 00:03:53,787
Thank you for not making fun
of me during my speech.

95
00:03:53,789 --> 00:03:55,956
It wasn't easy. Was it Buzz?

96
00:03:59,327 --> 00:04:01,728
We can't show up to
your mom's empty-handed.

97
00:04:01,730 --> 00:04:03,363
We should bring something.

98
00:04:03,365 --> 00:04:04,931
I already am.

99
00:04:04,933 --> 00:04:06,867
I'm bringing
the gift of knowledge.

100
00:04:06,869 --> 00:04:08,735
Oh, boy.

101
00:04:08,737 --> 00:04:10,904
Despite what her Bible says,

102
00:04:10,906 --> 00:04:12,839
recent archeological
studies indicate

103
00:04:12,841 --> 00:04:15,709
that although camels are
referenced in the Old Testament,

104
00:04:15,711 --> 00:04:17,577
they didn't exist
in the Middle East

105
00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:19,980
until hundreds of years later.

106
00:04:19,982 --> 00:04:22,783
I was gonna say we pick up
a cake or a pie.

107
00:04:22,785 --> 00:04:25,352
But an insult to her faith
is always thoughtful.

108
00:04:28,890 --> 00:04:30,557
So, what happens next?

109
00:04:30,559 --> 00:04:32,125
I can't tell you that.

110
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:33,460
But perhaps the killer dropped

111
00:04:33,462 --> 00:04:35,128
a fun and imaginative clue

112
00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:36,830
somewhere in the apartment.

113
00:04:36,832 --> 00:04:37,964
Ooh, I'm gonna check the fridge,

114
00:04:37,966 --> 00:04:40,801
and see if there are
any clues inside a beer.

115
00:04:41,969 --> 00:04:43,437
Hey, I-I found something.

116
00:04:43,439 --> 00:04:45,372
It looks like a little man
with a briefcase.

117
00:04:45,374 --> 00:04:47,541
Oh, no, no.
That's Clarence Darrow.

118
00:04:47,543 --> 00:04:50,944
It's from a game Sheldon made up
called <i>Chutes and Lawyers.</i>

119
00:04:52,814 --> 00:04:54,581
You slide down a chute
and then work your way back up

120
00:04:54,583 --> 00:04:56,783
through the appellate system.

121
00:04:58,219 --> 00:05:01,822
Well, unlike that,
my games are much more fun.

122
00:05:01,824 --> 00:05:02,889
Okay, can I ask you something?

123
00:05:02,891 --> 00:05:04,291
Why do you like making us
do this stuff?

124
00:05:04,293 --> 00:05:06,626
Well, I guess
it goes back to

125
00:05:06,628 --> 00:05:08,995
when I was a fat kid in India,
and didn't have any friends.

126
00:05:08,997 --> 00:05:10,297
I didn't know you were fat.

127
00:05:10,299 --> 00:05:11,631
Yeah, I was...

128
00:05:11,633 --> 00:05:14,401
I was 200 pounds by the time
I was in middle school.

129
00:05:14,403 --> 00:05:16,303
Kids were mean.

130
00:05:16,305 --> 00:05:17,504
Cows may be sacred there,

131
00:05:17,506 --> 00:05:19,706
but it doesn't help
if you look like one.

132
00:05:21,542 --> 00:05:22,742
Anyway, I was pretty lonely,

133
00:05:22,744 --> 00:05:24,611
so I had to make up
my own stories and games,

134
00:05:24,613 --> 00:05:25,912
and I promised myself

135
00:05:25,914 --> 00:05:28,081
if I ever made
any friends that...

136
00:05:28,083 --> 00:05:30,517
that I would play
those games with them.

137
00:05:30,519 --> 00:05:32,519
That is so sweet.

138
00:05:32,521 --> 00:05:34,287
I've seen old pictures of you.

139
00:05:34,289 --> 00:05:36,056
You were never a fat kid.

140
00:05:36,058 --> 00:05:37,824
No, I was svelte as a gazelle.

141
00:05:39,527 --> 00:05:42,429
A gazelle blessed with a flair
for storytelling.

142
00:05:46,134 --> 00:05:48,869
Hey, what about this?
It looks like a receipt.

143
00:05:48,871 --> 00:05:49,803
What's it for?

144
00:05:49,805 --> 00:05:50,904
For a cup of coffee.

145
00:05:50,906 --> 00:05:52,906
But it's dated
20 years from now.

146
00:05:52,908 --> 00:05:54,341
From the future?!

147
00:05:54,343 --> 00:05:56,510
How fun and imaginative.

148
00:05:57,912 --> 00:06:00,447
So one of us came back
from the future

149
00:06:00,449 --> 00:06:02,215
to murder Stuart?
Correct.

150
00:06:02,217 --> 00:06:04,117
Does the gazelle with a flair
for storytelling

151
00:06:04,119 --> 00:06:06,653
know he's just ripping off
<i>Terminator?</i>

152
00:06:06,655 --> 00:06:09,122
Does the smart-ass know
that <i>Terminator</i> was actually

153
00:06:09,124 --> 00:06:10,857
ripped off from an <i>Outer Limits</i>
script called

154
00:06:10,859 --> 00:06:13,026
<i>Demon With a Glass Hand,</i>
by Harlan Ellison?

155
00:06:13,028 --> 00:06:16,329
Oh, does the gazelle know that
according to Harlan Ellison,

156
00:06:16,331 --> 00:06:18,732
it was not ripped off
from <i>Demon With a Glass Hand,</i>

157
00:06:18,734 --> 00:06:21,334
but was ripped off from another
<i>Outer Limits</i> script

158
00:06:21,336 --> 00:06:22,936
he wrote called <i>The Soldier?</i>

159
00:06:22,938 --> 00:06:25,172
I'm gonna need
another clue.

160
00:06:28,609 --> 00:06:30,143
Okay...

161
00:06:30,145 --> 00:06:32,112
give me
the flowers and pie.

162
00:06:32,114 --> 00:06:34,214
But if we show up
and you're holding them,

163
00:06:34,216 --> 00:06:36,149
she'll think
they're only from you.

164
00:06:36,151 --> 00:06:37,551
They are only from me.

165
00:06:37,553 --> 00:06:40,520
You said the gift
of you was enough.

166
00:06:40,522 --> 00:06:42,989
Yes... but now

167
00:06:42,991 --> 00:06:44,724
that I've seen
what the gift of me

168
00:06:44,726 --> 00:06:46,126
with flowers and pie looks like,

169
00:06:46,128 --> 00:06:47,661
there's no going back.

170
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:52,999
Boy, I can't wait to see
the look on her face...

171
00:06:53,001 --> 00:06:54,201
We're leaving right now.

172
00:06:54,203 --> 00:06:55,368
What's wrong?
Nothing.

173
00:06:55,370 --> 00:06:57,771
What? Sheldon, tell me
what's going on!

174
00:06:57,773 --> 00:06:59,172
I saw my mommy with a naked man

175
00:06:59,174 --> 00:07:00,807
and she was trying
to be a mommy again.

176
00:07:13,551 --> 00:07:15,452
You ready to talk about it?

177
00:07:15,454 --> 00:07:17,587
I'm not nearly drunk enough.

178
00:07:20,091 --> 00:07:23,193
Okay.

179
00:07:25,165 --> 00:07:27,133
Do you have any idea
what it's like to see

180
00:07:27,135 --> 00:07:29,068
your mother ravaging someone?

181
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:32,505
Does a brisket count?

182
00:07:35,375 --> 00:07:37,543
I'm sorry, buddy, that's rough.

183
00:07:37,545 --> 00:07:39,044
But didn't she know
we were coming?

184
00:07:39,046 --> 00:07:40,045
No.

185
00:07:40,047 --> 00:07:41,914
I wanted to surprise her.

186
00:07:41,916 --> 00:07:45,017
What am I supposed to say to
her after something like this?

187
00:07:45,019 --> 00:07:46,852
Well, did she see you
in the window?

188
00:07:46,854 --> 00:07:47,953
No.

189
00:07:47,955 --> 00:07:49,054
Then don't say anything.

190
00:07:49,056 --> 00:07:51,257
I have to.

191
00:07:51,259 --> 00:07:54,026
How can we ever hope to have
a healthy relationship

192
00:07:54,028 --> 00:07:56,428
if I don't tell her
how disappointed I am,

193
00:07:56,430 --> 00:07:58,797
and that I'll never forgive her?

194
00:07:58,799 --> 00:08:01,867
Well, don't do it on the phone.

195
00:08:01,869 --> 00:08:03,369
No, I'm just going
to tell her I'm coming

196
00:08:03,371 --> 00:08:06,739
so she can give that Good
Time Charlie the heave-ho.

197
00:08:06,741 --> 00:08:08,507
That's some tough talk.

198
00:08:08,509 --> 00:08:10,142
I may need to cut you off.

199
00:08:11,178 --> 00:08:12,278
Yeah, maybe you better.

200
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:14,480
I took a pretty big sip.

201
00:08:17,584 --> 00:08:20,186
Look, she's a grown woman.

202
00:08:20,188 --> 00:08:23,856
And-and your dad's been
gone a long time.

203
00:08:23,858 --> 00:08:26,792
Maybe this is
none of your business.

204
00:08:26,794 --> 00:08:28,761
I beg to differ.

205
00:08:28,763 --> 00:08:31,230
I used to live in
those genitals.

206
00:08:32,866 --> 00:08:34,667
And if someone wants
to move into my old room,

207
00:08:34,669 --> 00:08:36,101
I should at least get a vote.

208
00:08:40,707 --> 00:08:42,908
Okay, murder suspects,

209
00:08:42,910 --> 00:08:45,911
Leonard has found the time
machine the killer must've used.

210
00:08:45,913 --> 00:08:47,046
You're all inside it,

211
00:08:47,048 --> 00:08:49,682
and we hurtle
through the very fabric of time.

212
00:08:57,591 --> 00:09:01,093
And welcome
to 20 years in the future.

213
00:09:02,829 --> 00:09:04,730
Hey, you guys
just time-traveled.

214
00:09:04,732 --> 00:09:07,333
Stop looking so bored.

215
00:09:07,335 --> 00:09:09,802
Well, my beer isn't flat
and my rack's not saggy.

216
00:09:09,804 --> 00:09:11,937
So far, the future's great.

217
00:09:13,106 --> 00:09:16,175
Hey, can I go to the bathroom?

218
00:09:16,177 --> 00:09:18,344
Fine, just try not
to look too alive.

219
00:09:18,346 --> 00:09:19,445
That's my jam.

220
00:09:22,249 --> 00:09:25,251
So one of us went back
in time to kill Stuart?

221
00:09:25,253 --> 00:09:26,352
But why?

222
00:09:26,354 --> 00:09:28,187
Perhaps this will help.

223
00:09:28,189 --> 00:09:29,288
Here are some facts

224
00:09:29,290 --> 00:09:32,925
about yourselves in the future

225
00:09:32,927 --> 00:09:35,995
that might contain a clue.

226
00:09:35,997 --> 00:09:36,996
Hey, I-I won

227
00:09:36,998 --> 00:09:38,964
the Nobel Prize in physiology.

228
00:09:38,966 --> 00:09:41,700
Then I used the money to buy
Stuart's comic book store,

229
00:09:41,702 --> 00:09:45,437
and close it down so Sheldon
would pay attention to me.

230
00:09:47,641 --> 00:09:50,409
Not the worst idea.

231
00:09:51,578 --> 00:09:54,146
Hey, I'm a famous actress
living in London.

232
00:09:54,148 --> 00:09:56,081
Hmm! I'm a professor at Stanford.
Hmm!

233
00:09:56,083 --> 00:09:57,983
So I guess you two are
making it work long distance.

234
00:09:57,985 --> 00:09:59,251
Oh, no.

235
00:09:59,253 --> 00:10:01,520
In this game,
as your careers both took off,

236
00:10:01,522 --> 00:10:02,354
you drifted apart.

237
00:10:02,356 --> 00:10:04,056
Kind of like how future me

238
00:10:04,058 --> 00:10:06,325
lost touch with you guys
after I became boy toy

239
00:10:06,327 --> 00:10:09,962
for the wrinkled,
but still flexible, Madonna.

240
00:10:11,197 --> 00:10:13,532
What does
your card say, Bernadette?

241
00:10:13,534 --> 00:10:14,633
Eh, eh, eh, hang on.

242
00:10:14,635 --> 00:10:16,635
Do-do you think
we'd really drift apart

243
00:10:16,637 --> 00:10:18,203
if we both became successful?

244
00:10:18,205 --> 00:10:19,672
Of course not.

245
00:10:19,674 --> 00:10:21,340
If I became a famous actress
and had to move,

246
00:10:21,342 --> 00:10:22,775
you would just come with me.

247
00:10:24,110 --> 00:10:26,378
But if I get a chance
to be a tenured professor,

248
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:28,947
I might not have that much
choice in where I end up.

249
00:10:28,949 --> 00:10:30,783
Yeah, but if I become
a successful actress,

250
00:10:30,785 --> 00:10:32,351
we wouldn't need the money.

251
00:10:32,353 --> 00:10:35,387
Well, you don't go
into science for the money.

252
00:10:35,389 --> 00:10:36,388
Speak for yourself.

253
00:10:36,390 --> 00:10:38,357
Last month,
my company both invented

254
00:10:38,359 --> 00:10:41,360
and cured
Restless Eye Syndrome.

255
00:10:43,697 --> 00:10:46,465
Ka-ching,
ya blinky chumps.

256
00:10:48,001 --> 00:10:50,002
So, wait, if my career
took me somewhere else,

257
00:10:50,004 --> 00:10:51,403
you might not go?

258
00:10:51,405 --> 00:10:52,871
Well...

259
00:10:55,842 --> 00:10:58,510
He started it.

260
00:10:58,512 --> 00:11:01,046
Okay, okay, guys--
new back stories.

261
00:11:01,048 --> 00:11:04,183
Uh, Penny and Leonard,
you two lovebirds are

262
00:11:04,185 --> 00:11:06,452
super successful
and living in New York.

263
00:11:06,454 --> 00:11:08,253
Uh, you're an actress,
you're a professor

264
00:11:08,255 --> 00:11:09,755
and you have
three beautiful kids.

265
00:11:09,757 --> 00:11:10,789
Great.

266
00:11:10,791 --> 00:11:11,924
Really? You think I'm putting

267
00:11:11,926 --> 00:11:13,425
this body through three kids?

268
00:11:15,962 --> 00:11:17,863
Okay, let's do this.

269
00:11:17,865 --> 00:11:18,897
Good luck.

270
00:11:18,899 --> 00:11:20,032
You...

271
00:11:20,034 --> 00:11:21,700
Aren't you gonna come with me?

272
00:11:21,702 --> 00:11:24,203
While you confront your mother
about her sex life?

273
00:11:24,205 --> 00:11:27,773
I'd rather go back to that bar
in ass-less chaps.

274
00:11:33,413 --> 00:11:35,481
Mother?

275
00:11:35,483 --> 00:11:36,882
Mother.

276
00:11:36,884 --> 00:11:38,350
Mother?

277
00:11:38,352 --> 00:11:41,253
Shelly!
I'm so glad you're here!

278
00:11:41,255 --> 00:11:43,222
I saw you having naked sex.

279
00:11:46,059 --> 00:11:47,593
What are you talking about?

280
00:11:47,595 --> 00:11:49,795
Earlier, I came here
to surprise you.

281
00:11:49,797 --> 00:11:52,798
I looked in the window
and I saw you with a man.

282
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:55,634
Oh, Shelly, I'm so sorry.

283
00:11:55,636 --> 00:11:57,269
Come in.

284
00:11:59,572 --> 00:12:00,906
Um...

285
00:12:00,908 --> 00:12:03,409
Maybe we should sit down

286
00:12:03,411 --> 00:12:05,110
and talk about this.

287
00:12:05,112 --> 00:12:07,379
Can you recommend a surface

288
00:12:07,381 --> 00:12:09,548
you haven't had coitus on?

289
00:12:11,451 --> 00:12:13,952
That's not funny.

290
00:12:16,956 --> 00:12:19,558
Maybe we should sit
at the table.

291
00:12:26,933 --> 00:12:29,134
Well, I'm sure that, uh,

292
00:12:29,136 --> 00:12:31,470
you...

293
00:12:31,472 --> 00:12:33,472
have a lot of questions.

294
00:12:33,474 --> 00:12:35,574
Who was he?

295
00:12:35,576 --> 00:12:36,542
His name is Ron.

296
00:12:36,544 --> 00:12:38,610
I met him at my prayer group.

297
00:12:39,612 --> 00:12:41,480
How long have you been
involved with him?

298
00:12:41,482 --> 00:12:42,681
A few months.

299
00:12:42,683 --> 00:12:44,683
And of those few months,

300
00:12:44,685 --> 00:12:48,120
how long have you been
a demented sex pervert?

301
00:12:51,057 --> 00:12:53,592
That is no way
to speak to your mother.

302
00:12:53,594 --> 00:12:55,160
Perhaps not.

303
00:12:55,162 --> 00:12:57,996
But it is a way to speak
to a woman who quoted the Bible

304
00:12:57,998 --> 00:13:00,065
to me my whole life,
and then desecrates

305
00:13:00,067 --> 00:13:02,935
one of Ethan Allen's
finest sofas.

306
00:13:02,937 --> 00:13:05,170
I will give you one opportunity,

307
00:13:05,172 --> 00:13:06,305
young man, to apologize.

308
00:13:06,307 --> 00:13:08,674
Or what?

309
00:13:08,676 --> 00:13:09,908
Or I will send you to your room.

310
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:12,177
That's ridiculous.

311
00:13:12,179 --> 00:13:13,946
I am a grown man.

312
00:13:13,948 --> 00:13:15,781
I am a professional scientist.

313
00:13:15,783 --> 00:13:18,217
And I currently occupy
the moral high ground.

314
00:13:18,219 --> 00:13:19,251
Go to your room.

315
00:13:20,787 --> 00:13:24,623
But I occupy
the moral high ground.

316
00:13:24,625 --> 00:13:25,824
Go to your room.

317
00:13:25,826 --> 00:13:28,861
But I'm
a professional scientist.

318
00:13:28,863 --> 00:13:31,630
Go... to your room!

319
00:13:36,035 --> 00:13:38,370
I'm a grown man.

320
00:13:40,807 --> 00:13:42,741
Can we please get back
to the game?

321
00:13:42,743 --> 00:13:43,842
I-I-In a minute.

322
00:13:43,844 --> 00:13:45,310
I-I-I don't understand
why any success

323
00:13:45,312 --> 00:13:47,312
you have in acting
is more important

324
00:13:47,314 --> 00:13:49,081
than any I have in science.

325
00:13:49,083 --> 00:13:51,116
Okay, if you do
something cool in science,

326
00:13:51,118 --> 00:13:52,384
you might change the world.

327
00:13:52,386 --> 00:13:53,519
If I become

328
00:13:53,521 --> 00:13:55,220
a famous actress...

329
00:13:55,222 --> 00:13:57,523
I'm not gonna tell you
why movie stars are the best.

330
00:13:57,525 --> 00:13:59,157
They just are.

331
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:02,961
I'm surprised you guys never
talked about this stuff.

332
00:14:02,963 --> 00:14:05,197
Like you and Sheldon have
everything figured out?

333
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:06,298
Actually,

334
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:07,266
our relationship agreement

335
00:14:07,268 --> 00:14:09,468
covers a wide array
of scenarios,

336
00:14:09,470 --> 00:14:12,037
including career changes,
financial instability,

337
00:14:12,039 --> 00:14:14,473
intelligent dog uprising...

338
00:14:15,174 --> 00:14:16,942
FYI, we plan on selling out

339
00:14:16,944 --> 00:14:19,111
the human race hard.

340
00:14:22,048 --> 00:14:25,017
In 20 years, who knows
what'll happen with any of us?

341
00:14:25,019 --> 00:14:27,486
I think you and Leonard
will be together.

342
00:14:27,488 --> 00:14:29,054
You do?
Yeah.

343
00:14:29,056 --> 00:14:31,223
I think you're
the best couple I know.

344
00:14:31,225 --> 00:14:32,824
Aw.
That's so sweet.

345
00:14:32,826 --> 00:14:35,227
What the hell?!
Excuse me?

346
00:14:35,229 --> 00:14:36,194
Ah-da-da-da-da!

347
00:14:36,196 --> 00:14:38,163
Let the dead man talk.

348
00:14:39,265 --> 00:14:40,399
So, why do you think that?

349
00:14:40,401 --> 00:14:42,200
Uh, well, I feel like

350
00:14:42,202 --> 00:14:45,270
you guys make each
other better.

351
00:14:45,272 --> 00:14:47,105
Penny brought Leonard
out of his shell.

352
00:14:47,107 --> 00:14:48,340
And it seems like Leonard

353
00:14:48,342 --> 00:14:50,442
makes Penny think more
deeply about the world.

354
00:14:50,444 --> 00:14:51,610
I don't know.

355
00:14:51,612 --> 00:14:54,680
Together, you two kind of
make one awesome person.

356
00:14:54,682 --> 00:14:56,882
Aw, Stuart.

357
00:14:56,884 --> 00:14:59,418
Now I feel bad
for murdering you.

358
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:02,120
Oh, come on!

359
00:15:02,122 --> 00:15:03,589
Penny did it! I win!

360
00:15:03,591 --> 00:15:06,558
Suck it, jackasses!

361
00:15:12,199 --> 00:15:14,866
Hey, can I come in?

362
00:15:14,868 --> 00:15:16,802
Apparently any man
is welcome in this house.

363
00:15:16,804 --> 00:15:18,937
Why not you?

364
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:22,374
I thought you were waiting
in the car.

365
00:15:22,376 --> 00:15:24,376
That was an hour ago, Sheldon.

366
00:15:24,378 --> 00:15:26,979
A Jew sits in front of a house
in Texas that long,

367
00:15:26,981 --> 00:15:29,114
"For Sale" signs
start to go up.

368
00:15:31,985 --> 00:15:35,420
I take it things didn't
go smoothly with your mom.

369
00:15:35,422 --> 00:15:37,789
No.

370
00:15:37,791 --> 00:15:40,926
I'm not sure how we're going
to get past this.

371
00:15:40,928 --> 00:15:42,127
You know, I...

372
00:15:42,129 --> 00:15:44,796
I sort of went
through something

373
00:15:44,798 --> 00:15:46,598
like this myself.

374
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:49,267
Howard, we've all seen
your mother naked.

375
00:15:51,571 --> 00:15:53,972
That woman needs to learn
how to tie a robe.

376
00:15:53,974 --> 00:15:57,542
I'm talking about when
my mom started seeing someone

377
00:15:57,544 --> 00:15:59,845
a couple years
after my dad left.

378
00:15:59,847 --> 00:16:02,681
I didn't know she did.

379
00:16:02,683 --> 00:16:06,251
Yeah, she was dating this guy,

380
00:16:06,253 --> 00:16:10,188
and I was kind of a jerk
to her about it.

381
00:16:10,190 --> 00:16:12,457
What did you do?

382
00:16:12,459 --> 00:16:14,526
Well, let's just say
it was the most vicious

383
00:16:14,528 --> 00:16:17,663
bar mitzvah speech in
the history of Temple Beth El.

384
00:16:18,631 --> 00:16:21,833
Anyway, she broke up with him.

385
00:16:21,835 --> 00:16:23,802
And she's basically

386
00:16:23,804 --> 00:16:26,038
been alone ever since.

387
00:16:27,173 --> 00:16:30,676
She never said it,
but I always felt

388
00:16:30,678 --> 00:16:33,879
I was the reason why.

389
00:16:33,881 --> 00:16:34,846
I'm sorry.

390
00:16:34,848 --> 00:16:36,314
Although,
based on your story,

391
00:16:36,316 --> 00:16:40,252
you absolutely
were the reason why.

392
00:16:41,187 --> 00:16:43,355
All I'm saying is
you might not want

393
00:16:43,357 --> 00:16:46,725
to get in the way
of your mom's happiness.

394
00:16:48,327 --> 00:16:50,562
You may have a point.

395
00:16:50,564 --> 00:16:53,398
I love my mother.

396
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:57,536
Even if she fornicates
like a demonic weasel.

397
00:17:01,507 --> 00:17:04,509
And the healing begins.

398
00:17:08,881 --> 00:17:09,915
Hello.

399
00:17:09,917 --> 00:17:10,949
Hello.

400
00:17:10,951 --> 00:17:12,284
Are you ready to discuss

401
00:17:12,286 --> 00:17:14,019
this calmly, like adults?

402
00:17:14,021 --> 00:17:16,555
I am.

403
00:17:28,835 --> 00:17:32,037
Shelly, I'm sorry that
you saw what you saw.

404
00:17:32,039 --> 00:17:34,372
I know that this
is hard for you.

405
00:17:34,374 --> 00:17:36,708
I think what most upsets me
about it, Mother,

406
00:17:36,710 --> 00:17:38,477
is the hypocrisy.

407
00:17:38,479 --> 00:17:40,445
Doesn't this contradict

408
00:17:40,447 --> 00:17:43,648
all the religious rules you've
been espousing your whole life?

409
00:17:43,650 --> 00:17:45,150
You're right, it does,
and it's something

410
00:17:45,152 --> 00:17:47,452
that I'm struggling
with these days.

411
00:17:47,454 --> 00:17:49,154
Then why are you doing it?

412
00:17:49,156 --> 00:17:51,990
Because I'm not
perfect, Shelly.

413
00:17:51,992 --> 00:17:54,960
And that man's booty is.

414
00:18:00,032 --> 00:18:03,869
Well, this is confusing for me.

415
00:18:03,871 --> 00:18:06,371
But I don't want to stand
in the way of your happiness.

416
00:18:06,373 --> 00:18:08,340
So...

417
00:18:08,342 --> 00:18:11,009
I'll condemn you internally
while maintaining

418
00:18:11,011 --> 00:18:13,945
an outward appearance
of acceptance.

419
00:18:15,047 --> 00:18:18,517
That is very Christian of you.

420
00:18:20,787 --> 00:18:22,721
Mother, if you're going
to conduct your life

421
00:18:22,723 --> 00:18:25,123
in this fashion,
then I should let you know

422
00:18:25,125 --> 00:18:28,293
that the world has changed
since you were a young woman.

423
00:18:28,295 --> 00:18:29,661
You know,
it's not all shock hops,

424
00:18:29,663 --> 00:18:33,465
soda jerks
and segregation anymore.

425
00:18:33,467 --> 00:18:37,035
How old do you think I am?

426
00:18:37,037 --> 00:18:40,705
My point is that you're going
to need to be careful.

427
00:18:40,707 --> 00:18:42,040
You used to be protected

428
00:18:42,042 --> 00:18:44,810
by your pre-Enlightenment
mythology,

429
00:18:44,812 --> 00:18:47,512
but now you're going
to need a stronger friend

430
00:18:47,514 --> 00:18:50,549
named latex.

431
00:18:51,751 --> 00:18:55,754
Are you having the
sex talk with me?

432
00:18:55,756 --> 00:18:57,088
Well, someone has to.

433
00:18:57,090 --> 00:18:59,624
Oh, dear Lord!
Yeah, well...

434
00:18:59,626 --> 00:19:02,194
No, don't look to Him.
He's mad at you right now.

435
00:19:12,161 --> 00:19:13,762
Oh, come on, don't pout.

436
00:19:13,764 --> 00:19:15,464
I'm sorry I ruined your game.

437
00:19:15,466 --> 00:19:17,632
I'm not pouting, I'm brooding.

438
00:19:17,634 --> 00:19:20,836
Which is how sexy men pout.

439
00:19:22,405 --> 00:19:24,172
It actually was kind of fun.

440
00:19:24,174 --> 00:19:25,273
You're just saying that.

441
00:19:25,275 --> 00:19:27,409
Yeah.

442
00:19:30,013 --> 00:19:31,980
I liked the time travel element.

443
00:19:31,982 --> 00:19:34,182
Thank you.
I thought it was inspired.

444
00:19:34,184 --> 00:19:35,951
It was. By <i>Terminator.</i>

445
00:19:37,253 --> 00:19:38,653
Well, I hope 20 years from now,

446
00:19:38,655 --> 00:19:39,855
we really are all still together

447
00:19:39,857 --> 00:19:40,856
and still friends.

448
00:19:40,858 --> 00:19:42,290
Definitely.
Of course.

449
00:19:42,292 --> 00:19:43,625
Well, hey, how about this?

450
00:19:43,627 --> 00:19:46,128
Whether we're friends,
not friends,

451
00:19:46,130 --> 00:19:47,796
scattered around the world,
no matter what,

452
00:19:47,798 --> 00:19:49,931
let's all promise to meet
in front of this building

453
00:19:49,933 --> 00:19:52,234
exactly 20 years
from tonight at 8:00 p.m.

454
00:19:52,236 --> 00:19:53,902
and have dinner
like we always do.

455
00:19:53,904 --> 00:19:55,170
Aw! I love it.

456
00:19:55,172 --> 00:19:56,204
Okay?

457
00:19:56,206 --> 00:19:57,272
Putting it
in my phone right now.

458
00:19:57,274 --> 00:19:58,473
Yeah, me, too.

459
00:19:59,776 --> 00:20:02,077
My phone doesn't
have a calendar.

460
00:20:06,382 --> 00:20:08,617
It's all right, I'll just
write it on my hand.

461
00:20:10,853 --> 00:20:12,954
And it's done.

462
00:20:12,956 --> 00:20:14,289
Yup, we're all in.

463
00:20:14,291 --> 00:20:16,224
All right, I'll see you guys
in 20 years.

464
00:20:24,284 --> 00:20:25,985
I knew it.
