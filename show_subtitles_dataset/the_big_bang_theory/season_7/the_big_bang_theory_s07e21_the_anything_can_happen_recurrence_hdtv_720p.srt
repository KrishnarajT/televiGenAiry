1
00:00:03,886 --> 00:00:07,154
where the killer ape DNA
is slowly taking over my body.

2
00:00:07,156 --> 00:00:08,455
Okay.

3
00:00:08,457 --> 00:00:11,058
But I realize
they're gluing fur everywhere,

4
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:12,192
except my cleavage.

5
00:00:12,194 --> 00:00:14,094
So, I asked
the director why

6
00:00:14,096 --> 00:00:16,363
and he says, it's important
to the story that my boobs

7
00:00:16,365 --> 00:00:18,832
be the last things to turn ape.

8
00:00:21,503 --> 00:00:24,505
It's sweet that he thinks
there's a story.

9
00:00:24,507 --> 00:00:27,140
Oh, and there's not even
a bathroom on set.

10
00:00:27,142 --> 00:00:29,409
I have to go to the gas station
across the street.

11
00:00:29,411 --> 00:00:31,345
I mean, I was dressed like
half an ape

12
00:00:31,347 --> 00:00:34,407
and still not even close to the
most disgusting person in there.

13
00:00:35,504 --> 00:00:37,162
Leonard, I could use
your assistance.

14
00:00:37,187 --> 00:00:38,386
Sure. What's up?

15
00:00:38,387 --> 00:00:39,987
Well, now that I've given up
string theory,

16
00:00:39,989 --> 00:00:42,322
I'm struggling to find
my next area of focus.

17
00:00:42,324 --> 00:00:44,458
So, in your
professional opinion,

18
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:46,326
which of these areas
do you think

19
00:00:46,328 --> 00:00:47,427
is the most promising?

20
00:00:47,429 --> 00:00:49,696
Huh, well, I-I think
there's some

21
00:00:49,698 --> 00:00:52,132
really innovative stuff
going on in dark matter.

22
00:00:52,134 --> 00:00:53,800
That's helpful.

23
00:00:56,638 --> 00:00:58,539
Okay. Of these four areas...

24
00:00:58,541 --> 00:00:59,673
Sheldon!

25
00:00:59,675 --> 00:01:01,375
What did we say about
being a nicer friend?

26
00:01:01,377 --> 00:01:02,776
Thank you.

27
00:01:02,778 --> 00:01:05,879
Leonard, what did we say about
being a gullible weenie?

28
00:01:07,181 --> 00:01:09,016
- It is just so frustrating.
- 'Cause you're

29
00:01:09,018 --> 00:01:10,617
trying too hard.
You need to do something else.

30
00:01:10,619 --> 00:01:11,919
Get your mind off it.

31
00:01:11,921 --> 00:01:15,389
Hey. How about we bring back
Anything Can Happen Thursdays?

32
00:01:15,391 --> 00:01:17,024
Hey, that's good.
Why'd you guys stop doing that?

33
00:01:17,026 --> 00:01:19,259
You made fun of us.
Said it was stupid.

34
00:01:20,228 --> 00:01:21,695
Yeah. Sounds like me.

35
00:01:22,664 --> 00:01:23,931
Come on, Sheldon.
What do you say?

36
00:01:23,933 --> 00:01:26,833
All right.
I officially reinstate

37
00:01:26,835 --> 00:01:28,168
Anything Can Happen Thursday.

38
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:30,137
Great! What do,
what do you want to do?

39
00:01:31,473 --> 00:01:32,839
I don't know.

40
00:01:32,841 --> 00:01:34,041
What do you want to do?

41
00:01:34,043 --> 00:01:36,143
I don't know.
What do you want to do?

42
00:01:36,145 --> 00:01:38,712
I'm starting to remember
the problem with

43
00:01:38,714 --> 00:01:40,247

00:02:10,452 --> 00:02:12,186
Hmm...

55
00:02:12,188 --> 00:02:14,688
what could we do that's fun?

56
00:02:14,690 --> 00:02:16,557
What could we do
that's different?

57
00:02:16,559 --> 00:02:19,927
What could we do that's free?

58
00:02:21,129 --> 00:02:22,430
Got it!

59
00:02:22,432 --> 00:02:24,498
We order a pizza.

60
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:26,333
Are you kidding?
That's what you always do.

61
00:02:26,335 --> 00:02:27,301
Think harder.

62
00:02:27,303 --> 00:02:29,303
You're right.
You're right.

63
00:02:29,305 --> 00:02:30,438
Got it!

64
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:33,074
We order calzones,
cut them open,

65
00:02:33,076 --> 00:02:35,142
eat them like pizza.

66
00:02:36,244 --> 00:02:37,678
All right! All right!
I'll shake the brain bush

67
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,413
one more time,
see what falls out.

68
00:02:40,482 --> 00:02:41,649
Got it!

69
00:02:41,651 --> 00:02:44,285
There's a live-action
role-playing group

70
00:02:44,287 --> 00:02:46,020
that meets every Thursday night
in Griffith Park

71
00:02:46,022 --> 00:02:49,256
and reenacts battles from
<i>Lord of the Rings.</i>

72
00:02:49,258 --> 00:02:52,893
Uh, tell me more
about this calzone idea.

73
00:02:54,062 --> 00:02:55,162
You know what?

74
00:02:55,164 --> 00:02:56,497
Why don't we just
ease into this.

75
00:02:56,499 --> 00:02:57,998
Let-Let's go for a walk

76
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,634
and-and-and see if
we find a new restaurant.

77
00:03:00,636 --> 00:03:04,105
Any chance that restaurant
is near Griffith Park?

78
00:03:06,675 --> 00:03:07,842
No.

79
00:03:07,844 --> 00:03:10,377
All right.

80
00:03:10,379 --> 00:03:12,446
Raj and Howard
are at Howard's mom's,

81
00:03:12,448 --> 00:03:14,281
but should we call the girls
and see if they want to come?

82
00:03:14,283 --> 00:03:15,649
No. Bernadette's
working late.

83
00:03:15,651 --> 00:03:16,817
Amy's sick.

84
00:03:16,819 --> 00:03:17,885
Aw. What's wrong with her?

85
00:03:17,887 --> 00:03:19,453
Well, she talks a lot.

86
00:03:19,455 --> 00:03:21,355
She always wants to hold hands.

87
00:03:21,357 --> 00:03:23,057
That's not what I meant.

88
00:03:23,059 --> 00:03:24,925
Well, if you were
referring to her illness

89
00:03:24,927 --> 00:03:26,927
your question should have been,
"What ails her?"

90
00:03:28,497 --> 00:03:29,463
"What ails her?"

91
00:03:29,465 --> 00:03:31,398
Oh. Who knows?

92
00:03:33,101 --> 00:03:34,401
Come on,
anything can happen.

93
00:03:34,403 --> 00:03:36,337
We can push him
down the stairs!

94
00:03:38,807 --> 00:03:40,908
Hey. Thanks for
coming to hang out.

95
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:42,910
No problem.
How's your mom feeling?

96
00:03:42,912 --> 00:03:46,447
Okay, but she'd feel better
if she took her medicine.

97
00:03:46,449 --> 00:03:48,449
You know, when Cinnamon
won't take her medicine,

98
00:03:48,451 --> 00:03:50,151
I hide it in a piece of cheese.

99
00:03:50,153 --> 00:03:51,986
Good idea.
We can wrap the pill in cheese,

100
00:03:51,988 --> 00:03:53,020
feed it to Cinnamon,

101
00:03:53,022 --> 00:03:54,688
and then my mom
can eat Cinnamon.

102
00:03:57,826 --> 00:03:59,026
What do you feel like doing?

103
00:03:59,028 --> 00:04:01,028
I was thinking
we could watch a DVD.

104
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:02,229
Well,

105
00:04:02,231 --> 00:04:04,765
my mom doesn't have
a lot to choose from.

106
00:04:04,767 --> 00:04:08,235
Unless you want to watch
the video of her colonoscopy.

107
00:04:10,005 --> 00:04:11,305
Spoiler alert:
20 minutes in,

108
00:04:11,307 --> 00:04:12,673
they find a prune pit.

109
00:04:12,675 --> 00:04:18,979
Actually, how do you feel about
watching <i>House of 1000 Corpses?</i>

110
00:04:18,981 --> 00:04:21,482
A straight-up gore-fest?

111
00:04:21,484 --> 00:04:22,516
You hate this stuff.

112
00:04:22,518 --> 00:04:24,451
I do, but for some reason,
Emily loves it

113
00:04:24,453 --> 00:04:26,353
and wants to watch it
with me tomorrow, so...

114
00:04:26,355 --> 00:04:27,555
I thought if
I start with you first,

115
00:04:27,557 --> 00:04:30,257
then I could act cool
about it with her.

116
00:04:30,259 --> 00:04:32,426
That's actually
not a bad plan.

117
00:04:32,428 --> 00:04:34,028
I can sit through
the colonoscopy now,

118
00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:35,496
but that first time
I was like,

119
00:04:35,498 --> 00:04:38,032
"Oh, My God, a prune pit!"

120
00:04:42,771 --> 00:04:44,205
Uh, so... you'd watch it?

121
00:04:44,207 --> 00:04:45,372
Sure.

122
00:04:45,374 --> 00:04:46,840
You're a good friend.
I owe you one.

123
00:04:46,842 --> 00:04:48,309
Howard!

124
00:04:48,311 --> 00:04:50,211
Help me get out of the tub!

125
00:04:54,416 --> 00:04:56,083
Not that one.

126
00:04:59,621 --> 00:05:02,089
So, we're just randomly
choosing a restaurant

127
00:05:02,091 --> 00:05:03,524
without researching it online?

128
00:05:03,526 --> 00:05:04,358
Yep.

129
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,926
Great.

130
00:05:05,928 --> 00:05:08,429
You know, this is how Anything
Can Happen Thursday turns into

131
00:05:08,431 --> 00:05:10,164
It Won't Stop Coming Up Friday.

132
00:05:11,967 --> 00:05:15,569
Hey, how about
that Asian fusion place?

133
00:05:15,571 --> 00:05:18,172
Fusion and Asians?

134
00:05:18,174 --> 00:05:21,442
I'm trying not to
think about science.

135
00:05:21,444 --> 00:05:23,544
What the hell?

136
00:05:25,113 --> 00:05:26,046
What...?

137
00:05:26,048 --> 00:05:27,381
She's not working late!

138
00:05:28,316 --> 00:05:30,684
And Amy doesn't
look sick.

139
00:05:30,686 --> 00:05:32,152
Why would they
lie to us?

140
00:05:32,154 --> 00:05:33,454
That's a good question.

141
00:05:34,557 --> 00:05:35,422
Amy and Bernadette.

142
00:05:36,325 --> 00:05:37,725
Amy and Bernadette.

143
00:05:37,727 --> 00:05:39,059
Amy and Bernadette.

144
00:05:39,061 --> 00:05:41,695
Why did you lie to us?!

145
00:05:44,332 --> 00:05:47,134
Hey. Listen to this:

146
00:05:47,136 --> 00:05:49,737
"Murder... cannibalism

147
00:05:49,739 --> 00:05:51,272
"and satanic rituals

148
00:05:51,274 --> 00:05:52,406
"are just a few

149
00:05:52,408 --> 00:05:55,075
of the thousand plus
horrors that await."

150
00:05:55,077 --> 00:05:57,144
I just helped my mom
out of the tub,

151
00:05:57,146 --> 00:05:59,847
so, I'm one slippery horror
ahead of you.

152
00:05:59,849 --> 00:06:01,048
You're a good son.

153
00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:03,284
I don't know how you do it.

154
00:06:03,286 --> 00:06:05,019
Beach blankets,
my friend.

155
00:06:05,021 --> 00:06:06,720
It's all about
beach blankets.

156
00:06:06,722 --> 00:06:10,157
All right,
let's get this over with.

157
00:06:10,159 --> 00:06:13,594
Ew, it's got
someone's hair on it!

158
00:06:13,596 --> 00:06:15,329
Oh, yeah, you're gonna
do great with this movie.

159
00:06:19,968 --> 00:06:22,670
You're not working late.
Why did you lie to me?

160
00:06:22,672 --> 00:06:24,938
And Amy, you told me
you were sick,

161
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:27,841
but you look just as pale
and tired as always.

162
00:06:29,411 --> 00:06:31,178
I'm sorry.
I just needed a break

163
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:34,181
from hearing you obsess about
what to do after string theory.

164
00:06:34,183 --> 00:06:36,350
And we kind of just
wanted one night

165
00:06:36,352 --> 00:06:38,719
where we didn't have to hear
about how miserable you are

166
00:06:38,721 --> 00:06:40,454
making this movie.

167
00:06:40,456 --> 00:06:42,556
But none of that means
we don't love you.

168
00:06:42,558 --> 00:06:45,192
I haven't been complaining
that much about the movie.

169
00:06:45,194 --> 00:06:47,761
Have I?

170
00:06:48,663 --> 00:06:50,030
I also love you.

171
00:06:53,435 --> 00:06:54,735
You know what?

172
00:06:54,737 --> 00:06:56,537
Maybe I need a break from
all of you.

173
00:06:56,539 --> 00:06:58,772
Come on, Sheldon.

174
00:06:58,774 --> 00:06:59,613
Where are we going?

175
00:06:59,638 --> 00:07:01,576
We're gonna have Anything Can
Happen Thursday, you're gonna

176
00:07:01,577 --> 00:07:03,544
tell me all about your science
stuff and I'm gonna complain

177
00:07:03,546 --> 00:07:05,279
about my movie, and we're gonna
support each other because

178
00:07:05,281 --> 00:07:06,447
that's what friends do.

179
00:07:06,449 --> 00:07:07,715
Okay.

180
00:07:07,717 --> 00:07:09,750
'Cause if I
had to pick now,

181
00:07:09,752 --> 00:07:10,680
I'd probably go with
dark matter because...

182
00:07:10,705 --> 00:07:12,705
Shut up.

183
00:07:29,633 --> 00:07:30,767
What's wrong?

184
00:07:30,769 --> 00:07:33,636
I don't understand my food.

185
00:07:34,938 --> 00:07:39,008
Chinese noodles with
Korean barbecue...

186
00:07:39,010 --> 00:07:41,444
in a taco.

187
00:07:43,247 --> 00:07:45,114
It's fusion.

188
00:07:45,116 --> 00:07:47,617
Well, my mother would
lock her car doors

189
00:07:47,619 --> 00:07:51,521
if she had to drive through
this hodgepodge of ethnicity.

190
00:07:54,758 --> 00:07:56,993
Think I've been complaining
too much about the movie?

191
00:07:56,995 --> 00:07:58,795
Not at all.

192
00:07:58,797 --> 00:08:00,229
Thank you.

193
00:08:00,231 --> 00:08:02,398
But to be fair, when you talk,
most of what you say

194
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:06,169
sounds like, "Wah,
wah, wah, clothes".

195
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:12,041
Hey, I don't understand
why you're not upset with Amy.

196
00:08:12,043 --> 00:08:14,610
I am. So much so that
I'm gonna bring her here

197
00:08:14,612 --> 00:08:16,846
for dinner on our
next date night.

198
00:08:27,157 --> 00:08:29,158
Okay.

199
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:31,861
So, in the last 20 minutes,

200
00:08:31,863 --> 00:08:34,664
we've seen a crazy woman
kissing a fetus in a jar.

201
00:08:36,066 --> 00:08:39,602
We've seen a guy
cut in half and sewn to a fish.

202
00:08:40,971 --> 00:08:43,806
And the brutal dismemberment
of a rotisserie chicken

203
00:08:43,808 --> 00:08:46,008
by my mother.

204
00:08:47,244 --> 00:08:51,581
On the bright side, she didn't
even notice the pill.

205
00:08:53,784 --> 00:08:56,452
Why does Emily like this stuff?

206
00:08:56,454 --> 00:08:58,654
Do you think there's something
psychologically wrong with her?

207
00:08:58,656 --> 00:09:01,124
What difference does it make?
What do you mean?

208
00:09:01,126 --> 00:09:02,758
Oh, come on-- she could
have a freezer full of

209
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:05,595
ex-boyfriend's body parts and
you'd still go out with her.

210
00:09:06,763 --> 00:09:08,397
I do like that
the ex-boyfriend's

211
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:09,832
out of the picture.

212
00:09:13,937 --> 00:09:16,038
I feel so bad about
lying to Sheldon.

213
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:17,807
How am I gonna
make it up to him?

214
00:09:17,809 --> 00:09:19,475
I'd tell you
what I do with Howard,

215
00:09:19,477 --> 00:09:21,777
but I don't think dressing up
like a Catholic schoolgirl

216
00:09:21,779 --> 00:09:24,847
is gonna work with Sheldon.

217
00:09:27,384 --> 00:09:29,485
He'd probably give you homework.

218
00:09:33,724 --> 00:09:35,925
Did you lie to Howard
about tonight?

219
00:09:35,927 --> 00:09:36,959
Of course.

220
00:09:36,961 --> 00:09:38,594
And you don't feel
guilty about it?

221
00:09:38,596 --> 00:09:39,862
Between Penny's gorilla movie

222
00:09:39,864 --> 00:09:43,366
and Howard's gorilla mother,
I had no choice.

223
00:09:44,434 --> 00:09:45,868
Thankfully Penny and I have

224
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:47,303
a relationship based on honesty.

225
00:09:48,806 --> 00:09:50,439
What?

226
00:09:50,441 --> 00:09:51,774
I don't lie to her.

227
00:09:51,776 --> 00:09:54,377
Oh, we know
<i>you</i> don't lie to <i>her.</i>

228
00:10:00,584 --> 00:10:02,084
Thank you.

229
00:10:02,086 --> 00:10:03,319
Hey, maybe the answer

230
00:10:03,321 --> 00:10:05,888
to your career question is
in one of these.

231
00:10:05,890 --> 00:10:08,658
Penny,
there's only one cookie

232
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:11,093
with something in the middle
that solves life's problems,

233
00:10:11,095 --> 00:10:13,162
and that's an Oreo.

234
00:10:14,364 --> 00:10:18,334
Or a Nutter Butter,
if you're in a pinch.

235
00:10:18,336 --> 00:10:21,137
Come on, open it.
I bet it says something great.

236
00:10:21,139 --> 00:10:22,939
This is Asian fusion.

237
00:10:22,941 --> 00:10:27,143
For all you know, there's
a tiny Chihuahua in here.

238
00:10:27,145 --> 00:10:29,111
Fine, I'll go.

239
00:10:29,113 --> 00:10:31,013
Hmm.

240
00:10:31,015 --> 00:10:33,916
"People turn to you
for guidance and wisdom."

241
00:10:33,918 --> 00:10:35,218
Yeah, that's a good one.

242
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:37,320
No, it's not.

243
00:10:37,322 --> 00:10:38,754
How is that not good?

244
00:10:38,756 --> 00:10:40,990
"Turn to you for wisdom"?

245
00:10:40,992 --> 00:10:43,693
Clearly,
that cookie is mocking you.

246
00:10:44,695 --> 00:10:46,295
You'd never hear
that kind of sass

247
00:10:46,297 --> 00:10:48,297
from a Nutter Butter.

248
00:10:48,299 --> 00:10:50,700
Uh, since you're paying for
dinner, I'll let that slide.

249
00:10:50,702 --> 00:10:52,134
Open yours.

250
00:10:53,770 --> 00:10:55,771
Have you ever paid for a meal?

251
00:10:55,773 --> 00:10:57,340
Not with money. Read.

252
00:11:00,277 --> 00:11:04,413
"Your warm and fun-loving nature
delights those around you."

253
00:11:04,415 --> 00:11:06,449
Oh, try again.

254
00:11:17,327 --> 00:11:19,595
Let me get this straight.

255
00:11:19,597 --> 00:11:22,231
So, he kills this girl's father,

256
00:11:22,233 --> 00:11:24,433
cuts off the guy's face,

257
00:11:24,435 --> 00:11:26,535
and is wearing it as a mask

258
00:11:26,537 --> 00:11:29,405
while he makes out with her.

259
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:31,307
I'm just gonna say it.

260
00:11:31,309 --> 00:11:34,043
That's not okay.

261
00:11:35,879 --> 00:11:37,780
Why can't I be in a relationship

262
00:11:37,782 --> 00:11:40,683
with a girl
who likes <i>The Sound of Music?</i>

263
00:11:40,685 --> 00:11:44,120
Raj, you <i>are</i> the girl
in the relationship

264
00:11:44,122 --> 00:11:46,322
who likes <i>The Sound of Music.</i>

265
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,995
Hey, Penny. What's up?

266
00:11:54,064 --> 00:11:56,232
No, Bernie's working late.

267
00:11:58,068 --> 00:12:00,469
Really?

268
00:12:00,471 --> 00:12:02,204
Thanks for telling me.

269
00:12:02,206 --> 00:12:04,974
What?

270
00:12:04,976 --> 00:12:08,110
I'm having sex with a Catholic
schoolgirl tonight.

271
00:12:14,018 --> 00:12:16,452
Oh, I think I see
our next stop.

272
00:12:18,122 --> 00:12:20,723
You can't be serious.

273
00:12:20,725 --> 00:12:22,491
If I wanted to waste my time
on nonsense,

274
00:12:22,493 --> 00:12:24,960
I'd follow Leonard
on Instagram.

275
00:12:25,996 --> 00:12:29,198
No, come on-- tonight,
we are trying new things.

276
00:12:30,968 --> 00:12:33,436
Oh! That's a lot of incense.

277
00:12:33,438 --> 00:12:36,138
Or someone set a hippie on fire.

278
00:12:39,810 --> 00:12:41,977
Yeah, honey,
I'm still stuck at work.

279
00:12:43,246 --> 00:12:44,613
Really?

280
00:12:44,615 --> 00:12:45,848
Penny said that?

281
00:12:47,951 --> 00:12:50,853
Okay, it's true. I'm sorry.

282
00:12:50,855 --> 00:12:53,122
I'll see you at home.

283
00:12:53,124 --> 00:12:55,491
Yeah, yeah, I'll put it on.

284
00:12:56,827 --> 00:12:59,228
You and I never just
hang out like this.

285
00:12:59,230 --> 00:13:00,396
Why is that?

286
00:13:00,398 --> 00:13:02,198
I know, it's weird, right?
Yeah.

287
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,366
We should do it more often.

288
00:13:03,368 --> 00:13:05,968
Oh, no. I mean, this
is weird right now.

289
00:13:07,338 --> 00:13:09,004
Oh.

290
00:13:09,006 --> 00:13:10,506
Ah, it's Penny.

291
00:13:10,508 --> 00:13:11,841
Is she still mad?

292
00:13:11,843 --> 00:13:12,975
Oh, doesn't seem like it.

293
00:13:12,977 --> 00:13:15,678
She got Sheldon to go
to a psychic with her.

294
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:16,979
A psychic?

295
00:13:16,981 --> 00:13:19,382
He considers them
not just mumbo jumbo,

296
00:13:19,384 --> 00:13:22,451
but extra-jumbo
mumbo jumbo.

297
00:13:22,453 --> 00:13:24,887
Well, Penny can be
pretty persuasive.

298
00:13:24,889 --> 00:13:27,923
She's gotten me to do a lot of
things I wouldn't normally do.

299
00:13:27,925 --> 00:13:29,859
Because she has
sex with you.

300
00:13:29,861 --> 00:13:32,895
Yeah, she does.

301
00:13:32,897 --> 00:13:35,264
Can I confess something?

302
00:13:35,266 --> 00:13:37,166
Once in a while,
I get a little jealous

303
00:13:37,168 --> 00:13:38,601
of how close Penny
and Sheldon are.

304
00:13:38,603 --> 00:13:39,667
Really?

305
00:13:39,692 --> 00:13:41,271
I mean, not in
a romantic way.

306
00:13:41,272 --> 00:13:44,740
It's just, she really has some
sort of connection with him.

307
00:13:44,742 --> 00:13:47,476
Well... Well, they've known
each other a long time,

308
00:13:47,478 --> 00:13:49,845
and Penny grew up around horses,

309
00:13:49,847 --> 00:13:53,649
so she knows how to approach him
without making him skittish.

310
00:13:53,651 --> 00:13:55,885
Don't get me wrong.
I'm glad they're friends.

311
00:13:55,887 --> 00:13:58,354
I just wish he'd be that
comfortable around me already.

312
00:13:58,356 --> 00:14:02,725
Well, it took him a long time to
get comfortable around me, too.

313
00:14:02,727 --> 00:14:05,027
Really? What did you do?

314
00:14:05,029 --> 00:14:08,497
Something terrible in a former life?
I don't know.

315
00:14:08,499 --> 00:14:11,033
I gotta go.

316
00:14:11,035 --> 00:14:12,635
Penny ratted me out.

317
00:14:12,637 --> 00:14:14,403
FYI, she's getting you
a watch for your birthday

318
00:14:14,405 --> 00:14:16,205
with money she took
out of your wallet.

319
00:14:22,279 --> 00:14:25,948
I don't mean to be
rude or discourteous,

320
00:14:25,950 --> 00:14:27,783
but before we begin,
I'd just like to say

321
00:14:27,785 --> 00:14:30,352
there is absolutely
no scientific evidence

322
00:14:30,354 --> 00:14:32,688
to support clairvoyance
of any kind.

323
00:14:32,690 --> 00:14:34,590
Which means--

324
00:14:34,592 --> 00:14:38,861
and again, no insult intended--
but you're a fraud...

325
00:14:39,696 --> 00:14:41,831
...your profession
is a swindle,

326
00:14:41,833 --> 00:14:43,365
and, uh, your livelihood
is dependent

327
00:14:43,367 --> 00:14:46,235
on the gullibility
of stupid people.

328
00:14:47,571 --> 00:14:50,639
Again, no offense.

329
00:14:50,641 --> 00:14:52,408
All right, Sheldon,
just ask your question.

330
00:14:55,613 --> 00:14:58,247
Okay, I just did.
What was it?

331
00:14:59,182 --> 00:15:00,516
Oh, for God's sake.

332
00:15:00,518 --> 00:15:01,817
Look, he's a physicist
who's trying to figure out

333
00:15:01,819 --> 00:15:03,118
what his next field
of study should be.

334
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,320
For your information,

335
00:15:04,322 --> 00:15:07,289
I was asking her
about the next <i>Star Trek</i> movie.

336
00:15:07,291 --> 00:15:11,093
Okay, I can answer that one:
I'll be bored.

337
00:15:11,095 --> 00:15:13,362
All right, why don't we begin?

338
00:15:21,137 --> 00:15:23,072
Your spirit guides
are telling me

339
00:15:23,074 --> 00:15:25,174
that there's a woman
in your life

340
00:15:25,176 --> 00:15:27,176
you're having problems with.

341
00:15:27,178 --> 00:15:29,345
That's an easy guess.

342
00:15:29,347 --> 00:15:31,046
I'm clearly an annoying person

343
00:15:31,048 --> 00:15:33,549
and have problems
with both genders.

344
00:15:33,551 --> 00:15:36,752
Yes, you clearly are.

345
00:15:38,054 --> 00:15:39,355
But I'm seeing

346
00:15:39,357 --> 00:15:40,956
a specific woman

347
00:15:40,958 --> 00:15:43,592
that you're in a romantic
relationship with.

348
00:15:43,594 --> 00:15:45,928
Oh, oh, here we go.

349
00:15:46,997 --> 00:15:48,063
Does she have dark hair?

350
00:15:48,065 --> 00:15:52,067
Yes! Yes! Your spirit guides
are on fire!

351
00:15:52,069 --> 00:15:54,270
The majority
of people have dark hair.

352
00:15:54,272 --> 00:15:56,772
Even you, at one time.

353
00:15:57,941 --> 00:15:59,808
Does she work
in a similar field to you?

354
00:15:59,810 --> 00:16:01,410
Ha! The opposite.

355
00:16:01,412 --> 00:16:04,580
She's a neurobiologist, and
I'm a theoretical physicist.

356
00:16:04,582 --> 00:16:06,815
My spirit guides
can go suck an egg.

357
00:16:08,051 --> 00:16:09,351
They're telling me

358
00:16:09,353 --> 00:16:11,787
that you have difficulty
being close with her.

359
00:16:11,789 --> 00:16:14,323
Oh, he does. He <i>so</i> does.
What should he do?

360
00:16:18,361 --> 00:16:20,863
He should give himself
to this relationship.

361
00:16:20,865 --> 00:16:22,932
Once he does, all his

362
00:16:22,934 --> 00:16:25,167
other pursuits will come
into focus.

363
00:16:25,169 --> 00:16:26,468
Sheldon, do you hear that?

364
00:16:26,470 --> 00:16:28,804
I mean, Amy is the key
to your happiness.

365
00:16:28,806 --> 00:16:30,005
Exactly.

366
00:16:30,007 --> 00:16:31,840
Personally and professionally.

367
00:16:31,842 --> 00:16:36,045
Everything will fall into place
once you commit to her.

368
00:16:41,184 --> 00:16:43,285
You know what this is?

369
00:16:43,287 --> 00:16:46,288
Yeah, and I reserve this word
for those rare instances

370
00:16:46,290 --> 00:16:47,990
when it's truly deserved.

371
00:16:47,992 --> 00:16:50,292
This is malarkey!

372
00:16:54,864 --> 00:16:56,532
Wow, you really struck a nerve.

373
00:16:56,534 --> 00:16:59,468
I've never heard him use
the "M" word before.

374
00:17:08,252 --> 00:17:09,753
Here we go:

375
00:17:09,755 --> 00:17:11,755
<i>House of a 1,000 Corpses.</i>

376
00:17:11,757 --> 00:17:13,557
Now, just so you know,

377
00:17:13,559 --> 00:17:16,293
I was a nanny for three years,
so if you get scared,

378
00:17:16,295 --> 00:17:18,528
I can totally change
your diaper.

379
00:17:18,530 --> 00:17:22,098
Actually, I have to
tell you something.

380
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:25,368
These kind of movies
really aren't my thing,

381
00:17:25,370 --> 00:17:27,304
so, last night,
I watched it

382
00:17:27,326 --> 00:17:28,765
just to see what I was
getting myself into.

383
00:17:28,790 --> 00:17:30,374
Okay.

384
00:17:30,375 --> 00:17:32,475
And I have to be honest--
I thought it was

385
00:17:32,477 --> 00:17:35,378
disturbing and weird,
and it made me wonder

386
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:37,581
what it says about
someone who enjoys it.

387
00:17:37,583 --> 00:17:39,749
I wonder that, too.

388
00:17:39,751 --> 00:17:41,751
Then, why do you
watch these things?

389
00:17:41,753 --> 00:17:44,487
Can I tell you something
without you judging me?

390
00:17:44,489 --> 00:17:46,456
Sure.

391
00:17:46,458 --> 00:17:48,458
They kind of turn me on.

392
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:51,094
And play.

393
00:17:56,434 --> 00:17:58,101
Attention...

394
00:18:03,207 --> 00:18:05,175
Hello.

395
00:18:05,177 --> 00:18:06,843
I didn't expect you
this evening.

396
00:18:06,845 --> 00:18:08,812
Well, I was just feeling so bad

397
00:18:08,814 --> 00:18:10,513
about lying to you
the other night,

398
00:18:10,515 --> 00:18:13,216
I wanted to make it up to you.

399
00:18:13,218 --> 00:18:15,552
And how do you propose
to do that?

400
00:18:26,981 --> 00:18:29,317
Unless you have <i>Gravity</i>
on Blu-ray under that skirt,

401
00:18:29,318 --> 00:18:30,850
I don't know
where you're going with this.

402
