1
00:00:01,395 --> 00:00:03,364
You know,
downward-facing dog

2
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:07,450
comes from the Sanskrit phrase
Adho Mukha Shvanasana.

3
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:09,819
Oh, that's beautiful.
What does it mean?

4
00:00:10,121 --> 00:00:12,302
"Downward-facing dog."

5
00:00:13,457 --> 00:00:14,937
Yeah, I guess they
don't have Sanskrit

6
00:00:14,963 --> 00:00:17,356
for "butts up and heads down."

7
00:00:17,958 --> 00:00:19,306
Hey, we wrote the Kama Sutra.

8
00:00:19,348 --> 00:00:21,897
If it involves butts,
there's a word for it.

9
00:00:23,185 --> 00:00:25,028
I thought we were getting
breakfast before work.

10
00:00:25,051 --> 00:00:26,621
Oh, right, sorry.

11
00:00:26,676 --> 00:00:28,598
It's my fault. I asked
Penny to do yoga with me.

12
00:00:28,679 --> 00:00:30,536
If you want, I can get
ready in five minutes.

13
00:00:30,610 --> 00:00:33,082
It's cute that you think that.

14
00:00:33,566 --> 00:00:34,808
Don't worry about it.

15
00:00:34,874 --> 00:00:35,944
Hey, can I ask you a favor?

16
00:00:35,969 --> 00:00:37,532
Would you mind taking
Cinnamon for a walk?

17
00:00:37,555 --> 00:00:39,255
Sure.
You're living here for free.

18
00:00:39,307 --> 00:00:40,935
I guess I owe you.

19
00:00:42,396 --> 00:00:44,262
Bye, Cinnamon.
Be a good girl.

20
00:00:44,349 --> 00:00:45,904
Yeah, bye, sweetie!
Bye!

21
00:00:45,991 --> 00:00:48,051
Yeah, yeah, bye, Leonard.

22
00:00:49,435 --> 00:00:53,419
Okay, and tree pose.

23
00:00:54,841 --> 00:00:57,021

with the infinite
resistance gyroscope.

33
00:01:32,725 --> 00:01:34,536
That's great. How so?

34
00:01:34,731 --> 00:01:36,244
Oh, the project is classified.

35
00:01:36,246 --> 00:01:37,279
I can't tell you.

36
00:01:37,545 --> 00:01:41,317
Oh, I suppose I could redact
the classified parts.

37
00:01:41,614 --> 00:01:45,123
All right, um, I came up
with an elegant solution

38
00:01:45,201 --> 00:01:46,668
to the...

39
00:01:48,387 --> 00:01:49,927
I used the...

40
00:01:52,091 --> 00:01:54,029
And then I...

41
00:01:58,380 --> 00:01:59,968
And that did it.

42
00:02:02,373 --> 00:02:04,772
Wow, I wonder
what they're redacting.

43
00:02:06,201 --> 00:02:08,232
Why don't you ask me
what I'm working on?

44
00:02:08,475 --> 00:02:10,873
Oh, very well.
What have you been working on?

45
00:02:10,946 --> 00:02:13,614
And feel free to honk
during the boring parts.

46
00:02:14,486 --> 00:02:16,219
I'm doing some experiments
to show

47
00:02:16,258 --> 00:02:18,147
that the signal
to move a muscle occurs

48
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:20,344
before you know
you even decided to move it.

49
00:02:20,608 --> 00:02:22,756
W... So you're attempting
to pinpoint

50
00:02:22,843 --> 00:02:25,108
where consciousness resides
in the brain.

51
00:02:25,333 --> 00:02:27,476
Yes, I'm trying to figure out
the nanometer

52
00:02:27,521 --> 00:02:30,085
and the attosecond,
precisely where and when

53
00:02:30,117 --> 00:02:32,085
an event of awareness
takes place.

54
00:02:32,655 --> 00:02:34,164
Well, what do you know?

55
00:02:34,284 --> 00:02:36,686
Here I was, waiting
to be bored with biology,

56
00:02:36,746 --> 00:02:39,483
and instead you tickle
my intellectual fancy.

57
00:02:39,608 --> 00:02:43,195
Which, unlike my body,
is an okay place to tickle.

58
00:02:44,904 --> 00:02:46,160
You know, when I was six,

59
00:02:46,216 --> 00:02:49,280
I wanted to marry the gorilla
from Good Night, Gorilla.

60
00:02:50,046 --> 00:02:51,968
Maybe I was onto something.

61
00:02:54,827 --> 00:02:57,218
Gentlemen,
the most interesting thing

62
00:02:57,277 --> 00:02:59,010
just happened with this spoon.

63
00:02:59,153 --> 00:03:02,414
Unless it was singing
"Be Our Guest," I doubt it.

64
00:03:03,498 --> 00:03:06,046
Yeah, I picked it up
without thinking about it.

65
00:03:06,077 --> 00:03:08,320
Which raises a
neuroscientific question,

66
00:03:08,404 --> 00:03:10,343
when did I decide to pick it up?

67
00:03:10,472 --> 00:03:12,803
The bigger question is, what are
you gonna eat with that spoon?

68
00:03:12,827 --> 00:03:15,085
You didn't get any food.

69
00:03:16,221 --> 00:03:18,140
He does raise
an interesting point.

70
00:03:18,346 --> 00:03:21,915
Amy is studying the time lag
between intent and awareness,

71
00:03:21,995 --> 00:03:23,256
and I realized that applies

72
00:03:23,286 --> 00:03:25,381
to the measurement problem
in quantum mechanics.

73
00:03:25,452 --> 00:03:27,726
Now, I recognize there
will be a time lag

74
00:03:27,786 --> 00:03:29,952
between me saying that and
you Googling what it means,

75
00:03:30,024 --> 00:03:31,256
so I'll wait.

76
00:03:32,796 --> 00:03:34,468
I understand it, Sheldon.

77
00:03:34,541 --> 00:03:35,546
Yeah, me, too.

78
00:03:35,734 --> 00:03:36,867
I'm sorry, I spaced.

79
00:03:36,935 --> 00:03:38,952
Are we still talking
about the spoon?

80
00:03:40,058 --> 00:03:42,000
It's nice to see you
taking an interest

81
00:03:42,034 --> 00:03:43,100
in Amy's work.

82
00:03:43,156 --> 00:03:44,343
Well, don't get me wrong.

83
00:03:44,368 --> 00:03:46,302
Neurobiology's nothing more
than the science

84
00:03:46,344 --> 00:03:47,676
of gray squishy stuff.

85
00:03:47,725 --> 00:03:49,791
But, you know,
when it connects to physics,

86
00:03:49,816 --> 00:03:52,765
gas up the Ford, Martha,
we're going for a drive.

87
00:03:54,789 --> 00:03:56,178
♪♪

88
00:03:56,421 --> 00:03:57,765
So did you confront Jennifer?

89
00:03:57,851 --> 00:03:59,405
I was going to,
but she called in sick.

90
00:03:59,524 --> 00:04:01,191
And guess who else
called in sick.

91
00:04:01,273 --> 00:04:02,858
Paul.
Paul.

92
00:04:02,928 --> 00:04:04,108
Who's Paul?

93
00:04:04,256 --> 00:04:05,969
Oh, you met him at the
office Christmas party.

94
00:04:05,993 --> 00:04:07,015
He's married to Nancy.

95
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,840
Oh, sure.
Wait, Nancy?

96
00:04:09,984 --> 00:04:11,898
I bet Jennifer gets
a promotion out of this,

97
00:04:11,956 --> 00:04:14,207
which is so unfair because I
work twice as hard as she does.

98
00:04:14,231 --> 00:04:15,741
Don't worry,
Jerry won't be fooled

99
00:04:15,813 --> 00:04:18,125
by that type of behavior.

100
00:04:21,765 --> 00:04:23,171
Jerry?

101
00:04:23,664 --> 00:04:26,699
It didn't work for Randy,
it didn't work for Tina,

102
00:04:26,757 --> 00:04:28,656
it sure as hell isn't
gonna work for Jennifer.

103
00:04:28,717 --> 00:04:30,765
Well, I hope not.
I just hate when

104
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:32,664
people play
those kinds of games.

105
00:04:33,745 --> 00:04:35,202
Tina?

106
00:04:35,882 --> 00:04:38,086
With your sales record,
you have nothing to worry about.

107
00:04:38,147 --> 00:04:39,301
Mm.

108
00:04:40,296 --> 00:04:42,914
I went to your office
Christmas party?

109
00:04:46,478 --> 00:04:49,241
You know, I like harp lessons,

110
00:04:49,363 --> 00:04:52,717
but I'm thinking of switching
to elevator repair lessons.

111
00:04:54,524 --> 00:04:55,991
What are you working on?

112
00:04:56,272 --> 00:04:58,433
I was thinking about
your experiment

113
00:04:58,515 --> 00:05:00,233
on the neuroscience
of decision making,

114
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:01,375
and I realized,

115
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:03,397
if we connect it
to the measurement problem

116
00:05:03,481 --> 00:05:05,312
in quantum mechanics,
we have a chance

117
00:05:05,358 --> 00:05:06,990
to disprove the role
of consciousness

118
00:05:07,063 --> 00:05:09,178
in the Copenhagen
Interpretation.

119
00:05:09,741 --> 00:05:12,217
Wait, are you saying if
we combine my experiment

120
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:13,510
with your calculations,

121
00:05:13,529 --> 00:05:15,467
we can determine
the precise moment in time

122
00:05:15,527 --> 00:05:17,336
when the wave function
collapses?

123
00:05:17,389 --> 00:05:19,077
It could be the most
inspired combination

124
00:05:19,118 --> 00:05:22,015
since I mixed red Icee
into my blue Icee.

125
00:05:24,541 --> 00:05:27,062
It was like drinking
2/7 of the rainbow.

126
00:05:28,325 --> 00:05:29,803
Sheldon, this is
really interesting.

127
00:05:29,877 --> 00:05:32,452
Yeah, and this one won't
stain my teeth purple.

128
00:05:33,546 --> 00:05:35,012
You know, we've never
collaborated

129
00:05:35,115 --> 00:05:36,193
professionally before.

130
00:05:36,245 --> 00:05:38,553
Are you worried it might
affect our relationship?

131
00:05:38,724 --> 00:05:40,461
That is a valid point.

132
00:05:40,539 --> 00:05:43,156
Perhaps we should establish
some ground rules.

133
00:05:43,207 --> 00:05:44,495
Well, that would
make me feel better.

134
00:05:44,519 --> 00:05:45,627
All right, let's
start right now.

135
00:05:45,652 --> 00:05:48,586
Uh, rule number one,
no using sexuality

136
00:05:48,623 --> 00:05:50,490
to get your way.

137
00:05:51,536 --> 00:05:52,945
That's a ridiculous rule.

138
00:05:53,007 --> 00:05:54,726
Is it?

139
00:06:01,741 --> 00:06:04,671
Okay, how is that?

140
00:06:09,486 --> 00:06:11,329
I can actually feel the toxins

141
00:06:11,428 --> 00:06:14,128
being pulled out of my skin.

142
00:06:14,635 --> 00:06:16,908
Well, this is
a moisturizing mask.

143
00:06:17,038 --> 00:06:19,024
Oh, well, then I can
actually feel

144
00:06:19,072 --> 00:06:21,767
the moisture going into my skin.

145
00:06:22,721 --> 00:06:24,120
Hey, I hope you don't mind,
I used a little

146
00:06:24,144 --> 00:06:25,577
of your eye cream last night.

147
00:06:25,712 --> 00:06:28,829
I thought someone looked
brighter and tighter.

148
00:06:34,193 --> 00:06:36,274
I'd still like to know
who Jerry is.

149
00:06:37,002 --> 00:06:38,481
Don't worry about it.
Hey, after this,

150
00:06:38,514 --> 00:06:40,474
how about we all go out
and do something together?

151
00:06:40,543 --> 00:06:42,579
That would be great.
Thank you.

152
00:06:42,642 --> 00:06:43,736
You want to go shopping?

153
00:06:43,799 --> 00:06:45,493
Ooh, yes. Fun.

154
00:06:45,596 --> 00:06:47,798
Or we could do something
we'll all enjoy,

155
00:06:47,846 --> 00:06:49,486
like play a board game.

- on our ground rules.
- Oh, good.

170
00:07:30,779 --> 00:07:32,195
What are they?
Okay, uh,

171
00:07:32,226 --> 00:07:34,125
number one:
in matters of physics,

172
00:07:34,197 --> 00:07:35,608
I have the final say.

173
00:07:35,658 --> 00:07:38,692
In matters of neuroscience,
you have the final say.

174
00:07:38,772 --> 00:07:40,695
Unless I disagree.

175
00:07:41,382 --> 00:07:42,483
Oh, here.

176
00:07:42,570 --> 00:07:45,351
Number two: when we publish,
my name goes first.

177
00:07:45,423 --> 00:07:48,303
Oh, subsequently, if we win any
awards, I speak first.

178
00:07:48,368 --> 00:07:50,969
I don't want to be talking when
the orchestra plays us off.

179
00:07:51,890 --> 00:07:53,123
Can I see that?

180
00:07:53,176 --> 00:07:54,676
Oh, of course.

181
00:08:00,673 --> 00:08:02,469
I'll get that back.

182
00:08:03,265 --> 00:08:04,702
Like all my underwear,
that notebook says

183
00:08:04,726 --> 00:08:06,445
"Property of Sheldon Cooper."

184
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:09,555
Sheldon, if we're
gonna have ground rules,

185
00:08:09,586 --> 00:08:10,962
I'll tell you
the first ground rule...

186
00:08:10,986 --> 00:08:12,570
I make the ground rules.

187
00:08:13,007 --> 00:08:15,735
I'd write that down,
but I can't now, can I?

188
00:08:19,329 --> 00:08:20,938
I mean, they didn't
say anything,

189
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:22,551
but I just kind of
felt like I was being

190
00:08:22,618 --> 00:08:24,406
a weird third wheel.

191
00:08:24,765 --> 00:08:27,515
Huh, so you can tell
what that feels like.

192
00:08:27,579 --> 00:08:29,180
Interesting.

193
00:08:29,779 --> 00:08:32,789
Anyway, I figured I can
hang out with my friends

194
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:34,326
and have fun, too.

195
00:08:34,462 --> 00:08:36,992
Well, if your idea of fun
is riding in a minivan

196
00:08:37,033 --> 00:08:38,097
to Target for diapers,

197
00:08:38,130 --> 00:08:40,375
things are about to get nuts.

198
00:08:41,254 --> 00:08:43,087
Oh, it's just nice
to be with people

199
00:08:43,174 --> 00:08:44,740
who are happy to have me around.

200
00:08:44,867 --> 00:08:46,313
Isn't that right, Halley?

201
00:08:50,343 --> 00:08:53,014
Well, at least someone had
the courage to say it.

202
00:08:55,216 --> 00:08:57,461
Thank you, you are
a good citizen.

203
00:08:58,093 --> 00:08:59,641
Told you.

204
00:09:00,136 --> 00:09:01,857
Go ahead, throw
my underwear out the window.

205
00:09:01,895 --> 00:09:03,672
Same thing's gonna happen.

206
00:09:04,125 --> 00:09:05,360
Terrific.

207
00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:07,485
Do you want to hear our
new set of ground rules?

208
00:09:07,509 --> 00:09:08,836
Fire away.

209
00:09:09,024 --> 00:09:11,407
Number one:
we're on the same team,

210
00:09:11,462 --> 00:09:12,789
we're not in competition.

211
00:09:12,854 --> 00:09:16,992
That's smart, because
Sheldon: 1, Amy: 0.

212
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:20,664
Number two: disagreements
can happen politely.

213
00:09:20,773 --> 00:09:22,914
There's no need
to call an idea stupid.

214
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,242
Aw, someone drew a penis in it.

215
00:09:28,585 --> 00:09:29,856
Are you listening?

216
00:09:29,896 --> 00:09:31,263
I'm sorry, go ahead.

217
00:09:31,468 --> 00:09:32,668
Number three.

218
00:09:32,755 --> 00:09:35,218
To avoid getting frustrated,
we take built-in breaks

219
00:09:35,259 --> 00:09:37,399
and reward our successes
with a small treat.

220
00:09:37,486 --> 00:09:39,265
Ooh, that sounds fun.

221
00:09:39,345 --> 00:09:41,066
Now, we're talking about
real treats, right?

222
00:09:41,097 --> 00:09:44,172
Not Bible verses like my
mother used to give me.

223
00:09:45,265 --> 00:09:46,828
Whatever you want.

224
00:09:46,992 --> 00:09:48,976
So, shall we get to work?

225
00:09:49,226 --> 00:09:51,446
Biology and physics
coming together...

226
00:09:51,518 --> 00:09:54,610
This is like the peanut
butter cup of the mind.

227
00:09:54,907 --> 00:09:57,211
Oh, I know what I
want my treat to be!

Wow.
Look at that.

00:10:43,274 --> 00:10:45,976
Yes, this is remarkable.

246
00:10:46,188 --> 00:10:49,194
So we're agreed:
it's complete garbage.

247
00:10:51,665 --> 00:10:53,899
By the way,
your name can go first.

248
00:11:04,093 --> 00:11:05,734
I mean, I'm glad
they're getting along,

249
00:11:05,809 --> 00:11:07,630
but it's starting to
make me uncomfortable.

250
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:10,086
Well, are you worried he's
like another man in her life?

251
00:11:10,179 --> 00:11:13,343
A little, until I saw them
in matching tops, so...

252
00:11:14,554 --> 00:11:17,274
Nice. 174 diapers.

253
00:11:17,366 --> 00:11:19,539
That ought
to get us to Wednesday.

254
00:11:21,289 --> 00:11:22,851
Well, have you talked
to them about it?

255
00:11:22,928 --> 00:11:24,313
Well, what am I
supposed to say...

256
00:11:24,383 --> 00:11:26,140
"Stop having fun without me"?

257
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:28,734
This one says that
every time I go out.

258
00:11:29,336 --> 00:11:31,500
See? I listen to you.

259
00:11:33,929 --> 00:11:36,063
Look, Raj just
gets along with women.

260
00:11:36,164 --> 00:11:38,468
I-I know, but he was my friend first.

261
00:11:38,547 --> 00:11:39,859
It's like she's stealing him

262
00:11:39,929 --> 00:11:41,649
and they're just
having the best time

263
00:11:41,711 --> 00:11:44,301
doing all their dumb
girly stuff together.

264
00:11:44,508 --> 00:11:45,524
You sure you don't fit in?

265
00:11:45,525 --> 00:11:47,633
You sound like
a catty bitch to me.

266
00:11:53,890 --> 00:11:55,366
I don't know where
we went wrong.

267
00:11:55,438 --> 00:11:57,640
Yeah, the math is so inelegant.

268
00:11:57,696 --> 00:12:00,633
I'm not even sure
it makes sense.

269
00:12:01,093 --> 00:12:03,524
Well, don't give up.
Maybe we can fix it.

270
00:12:09,609 --> 00:12:11,609
Can you stop breathing so loud?

271
00:12:11,717 --> 00:12:14,101
I can hear your nose whistling.

272
00:12:14,795 --> 00:12:17,523
I can hear your face
talking, so we're even.

273
00:12:23,490 --> 00:12:25,523
All right, either blow your nose

274
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,702
or teach it to play
"Camptown Races."

275
00:12:29,038 --> 00:12:31,404
Fine. Fine.
You want me to blow my nose?

276
00:12:31,443 --> 00:12:32,693
Here, I'll blow it.

277
00:12:38,192 --> 00:12:39,365
Better?

278
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:41,351
No, I can still hear it.

279
00:12:42,038 --> 00:12:44,193
Oh, wait, that's me.
Never mind, it's fine.

280
00:12:44,928 --> 00:12:46,048
You know, you're exhausting.

281
00:12:46,101 --> 00:12:47,809
I knew working together
was a bad idea.

282
00:12:47,835 --> 00:12:49,045
Hold on.

283
00:12:49,121 --> 00:12:52,351
I see what's wrong here.
We did the propagation only to

284
00:12:52,390 --> 00:12:55,476
the occipital lobe, not
to the prefrontal cortex.

285
00:12:55,624 --> 00:12:58,601
That would mean that
this delayed parameter

286
00:12:58,678 --> 00:13:01,756
should be increased
250 milliseconds.

287
00:13:01,913 --> 00:13:04,168
Oh, that is much better.

288
00:13:04,476 --> 00:13:06,788
Yeah, boy, if good ideas
came out of your brain the way

289
00:13:06,859 --> 00:13:09,545
mucus comes out of your nose,
we'd be in good shape.

290
00:13:13,654 --> 00:13:15,981
Now, take a sip,

291
00:13:16,045 --> 00:13:17,670
swirl it around your mouth,

292
00:13:17,765 --> 00:13:19,765
and try to notice the flavors,

293
00:13:19,851 --> 00:13:22,726
the tannins, the textures.

294
00:13:25,794 --> 00:13:26,913
Well?

295
00:13:27,068 --> 00:13:28,480
I probably should have

296
00:13:28,505 --> 00:13:30,640
spit out my gum first.

297
00:13:35,015 --> 00:13:36,717
Yeah. You know,

298
00:13:36,857 --> 00:13:39,062
the last couple of weeks
have been pretty rough,

299
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:40,538
but, uh, staying
here with you guys

300
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:42,139
has really helped take
my mind off of it.

301
00:13:42,163 --> 00:13:44,045
Mm. Well, we've
loved having you around.

302
00:13:44,092 --> 00:13:45,437
Right, sweetie?

303
00:13:48,130 --> 00:13:49,255
Leonard?

304
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:50,725
Yeah, when did he leave?

305
00:13:50,817 --> 00:13:53,184
Yeah, that's rude.

306
00:13:55,850 --> 00:13:57,749
You know, it's nice
to spend time with people

307
00:13:57,803 --> 00:14:01,026
who don't talk about work like
it's some kind of soap opera.

308
00:14:01,263 --> 00:14:04,197
Jennifer still trying
to sleep her way to the top?

309
00:14:06,130 --> 00:14:07,975
Yeah.

310
00:14:08,702 --> 00:14:11,335
You should be happy someone
wants to do the stuff with Penny

311
00:14:11,396 --> 00:14:12,561
you don't want to.

312
00:14:12,678 --> 00:14:14,318
Yeah, I wish I had that
with Howard.

313
00:14:14,365 --> 00:14:15,374
Wait.

314
00:14:15,934 --> 00:14:17,418
What? What do I make you do?

315
00:14:17,663 --> 00:14:19,271
Let's see:
the magic store,

316
00:14:19,394 --> 00:14:21,154
the Doctor Who convention,

317
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:24,663
the National Belt Buckle
Collector's meet and greet.

318
00:14:25,779 --> 00:14:27,226
It said right there
on the invitation,

319
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:28,302
"Buckle up for fun."

320
00:14:28,327 --> 00:14:30,341
It's not my fault
you didn't listen.

321
00:14:32,249 --> 00:14:34,058
I'm sure I'm overreacting.

322
00:14:34,202 --> 00:14:36,044
You're entitled
to feel how you feel.

323
00:14:36,124 --> 00:14:38,178
If you don't like it,
you should just talk to her.

324
00:14:38,255 --> 00:14:40,561
I don't want to sound
like a jealous baby.

325
00:14:40,634 --> 00:14:43,538
Oh, then maybe
you shouldn't talk to her.

326
00:14:44,497 --> 00:14:45,606
♪♪

327
00:14:45,654 --> 00:14:46,663
You know, I had a feeling

328
00:14:46,688 --> 00:14:48,326
you were using the wrong
computational model,

329
00:14:48,350 --> 00:14:50,515
but I didn't say anything
'cause you're so sensitive.

330
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:52,585
Just because
I am easily bothered

331
00:14:52,615 --> 00:14:54,865
by light, heat, sound, smell
and the way birds look at me

332
00:14:54,896 --> 00:14:56,678
does not mean I'm sensitive!

333
00:14:58,232 --> 00:14:59,716
Hey,

334
00:14:59,835 --> 00:15:02,249
I wonder what kind of success
we'd have

335
00:15:02,341 --> 00:15:05,521
if we defined measurement
as the first moment

336
00:15:05,606 --> 00:15:08,490
that an action potential
is seen by the visual cortex.

337
00:15:08,826 --> 00:15:12,029
That is a daring
and insightful solution.

338
00:15:12,271 --> 00:15:13,577
We're finally making progress.

339
00:15:13,626 --> 00:15:16,005
I wish we could do it
without fighting.

340
00:15:16,630 --> 00:15:19,865
What if the fighting is the
reason we're making progress?

341
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:23,942
I suppose it's conceivable
that the hormones associated

342
00:15:23,966 --> 00:15:25,443
with our fight-or-flight
response

343
00:15:25,521 --> 00:15:28,240
could be sharpening
our cognitive processes.

344
00:15:28,443 --> 00:15:30,146
Well, if that's the case,

345
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:33,952
then your grandparents mumble
and have bad posture.

346
00:15:35,771 --> 00:15:37,889
How dare you speak that way
about my Grammy...

347
00:15:37,975 --> 00:15:39,990
Hey, wait a second. Wait.

348
00:15:43,015 --> 00:15:47,116
Delta "T" could equal
alpha sub-zero.

349
00:15:48,499 --> 00:15:51,003
It seems we have
a choice to make.

350
00:15:51,561 --> 00:15:54,624
Abandon all ground rules
in the name of science,

351
00:15:54,749 --> 00:15:58,841
or... give up collaborating for
the sake of our relationship.

352
00:16:00,077 --> 00:16:02,047
