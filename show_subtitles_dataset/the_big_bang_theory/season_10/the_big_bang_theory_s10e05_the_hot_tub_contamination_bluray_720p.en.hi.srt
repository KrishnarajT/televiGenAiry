1
00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:01,442
Previously on
The Big Bang Theory...

2
00:00:01,646 --> 00:00:03,792
Cohabitation with my girlfriend?

3
00:00:03,793 --> 00:00:05,684
That's a great deal
to process.

4
00:00:05,708 --> 00:00:06,228
Hmm?

5
00:00:06,229 --> 00:00:07,829
It's only for five weeks.

6
00:00:07,831 --> 00:00:09,130
Let me appeal
to the scientist in you.

7
00:00:09,132 --> 00:00:11,165
Given the five-week
end date,

8
00:00:11,167 --> 00:00:14,135
isn't it the perfect opportunity
to consider this an experiment

9
00:00:14,137 --> 00:00:16,204
and collect data
on our compatibility?

10
00:00:16,206 --> 00:00:19,307
Don't try luring me
in with sexy talk.

11
00:00:19,309 --> 00:00:20,975
Okay.

12
00:00:20,977 --> 00:00:22,443
Star Trek: The Original Series.

13
00:00:22,445 --> 00:00:24,312
The Enterprise was
on a five-year mission

14
00:00:24,314 --> 00:00:25,446
to explore new worlds.

15
00:00:25,448 --> 00:00:26,647
Think of this
as your personal

16
00:00:26,649 --> 00:00:29,050
five-week mission
to do the same.

17
00:00:29,052 --> 00:00:33,521
Oh, you want to lure me in with
sexy talk, that's how you do it.

18
00:00:33,523 --> 00:00:35,156
Okay, why don't you guys
stay across the hall

19
00:00:35,158 --> 00:00:36,891
and we will
live here?

20
00:00:38,328 --> 00:00:40,027
Very well. I'm on board.

21
00:00:40,029 --> 00:00:41,562
- Seriously?
- Yes.

22
00:00:41,564 --> 00:00:43,097
I accept this
five-week mission

23
00:00:43,099 --> 00:00:44,932
to share a living space
with my girlfriend.

24
00:00:44,934 --> 00:00:46,434
Oh. This is so exciting.

25
00:00:46,436 --> 00:00:48,469
Well, now, don't be surprised
if, like Star Trek,

26
00:00:48,471 --> 00:00:51,806
it's canceled in three.

27
00:00:53,309 --> 00:00:55,777
Okay, I'm confused.

28
00:00:55,779 --> 00:00:57,245
Which one is Mr. Robot?

29
00:00:57,247 --> 00:00:58,679
I'll give you a hint.

30
00:00:58,681 --> 00:01:01,182
We're watching
Daredevil.

31
00:01:01,184 --> 00:01:04,685
Will you two please inform Amy
how much you enjoy

32
00:01:04,687 --> 00:01:07,021
adhering
to a strict bathroom schedule?

33
00:01:07,023 --> 00:01:08,055
- Can't.
- Won't.

34
00:01:08,057 --> 00:01:09,290
- Didn't.
- Don't.

35
00:01:09,292 --> 00:01:10,558
I told you,

36
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:13,361
you can't regulate every aspect
of our lives.

37
00:01:13,363 --> 00:01:17,131
I can if you'd just roll over
and accept your fate.

38
00:01:17,133 --> 00:01:19,600
I'm sorry
for bringing this over here.

39
00:01:19,602 --> 00:01:21,302
Believe me, we know
what you're going through.

40
00:01:21,304 --> 00:01:23,905
And I-I think the most helpful
thing we can tell you is

41
00:01:23,907 --> 00:01:25,126
no backsies.

42
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:26,942
Mm-hmm.

43
00:01:26,943 --> 00:01:28,276
Sheldon,
I understand

44
00:01:28,278 --> 00:01:29,710
that you like things
a certain way

45
00:01:29,712 --> 00:01:31,379
and I'm willing
to make some concessions,

46
00:01:31,381 --> 00:01:33,781
but you have to be open
to compromise.

47
00:01:33,783 --> 00:01:35,283
She's right.
That's reasonable.

48
00:01:35,285 --> 00:01:37,084
Oh, look who's in
favor of compromise,

49
00:01:37,086 --> 00:01:40,488
the woman who married
Leonard Hofstadter.

50
00:01:40,490 --> 00:01:42,723
Hey, she didn't
compromise.

51
00:01:42,725 --> 00:01:45,393
She settled.
There's a difference.

52
00:01:46,129 --> 00:01:48,663

63
00:02:17,571 --> 00:02:19,104
What time do you
and Bernadette head out?

64
00:02:19,122 --> 00:02:20,655
As soon as I get home.

65
00:02:20,657 --> 00:02:22,090
We're hoping to make it
before dark.

66
00:02:22,092 --> 00:02:23,858
I've never been
to Palm Springs.

67
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:25,193
Oh, you
should go.

68
00:02:25,195 --> 00:02:27,462
It's terrific.
I-I really thrive anywhere

69
00:02:27,464 --> 00:02:30,999
the women and the temperature
are over 90.

70
00:02:31,902 --> 00:02:33,268
I don't know.

71
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:34,869
If I want to watch
old people sweat,

72
00:02:34,871 --> 00:02:38,072
I can just FaceTime
my family in India.

73
00:02:39,042 --> 00:02:40,041
It's nice you

74
00:02:40,043 --> 00:02:41,976
and Bernadette are getting away.

75
00:02:41,978 --> 00:02:44,612
Well, she wants us to
spend more time together

76
00:02:44,614 --> 00:02:45,980
before the baby comes.

77
00:02:45,982 --> 00:02:48,383
So then what are you doing here
buying comic books?

78
00:02:48,385 --> 00:02:50,852
Well, he wants us to
spend more time together

79
00:02:50,854 --> 00:02:52,921
before the baby comes.

80
00:02:55,091 --> 00:02:57,392
When you live with someone,
there's gonna be conflict.

81
00:02:57,394 --> 00:03:00,228
You just have
to keep communicating.

82
00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:01,829
I'm open to that.

83
00:03:01,831 --> 00:03:04,332
Okay. Well, for starters,

84
00:03:04,334 --> 00:03:06,868
there's nothing wrong
with keeping our toothbrushes

85
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:08,569
in the same holder.

86
00:03:09,406 --> 00:03:11,973
Sheldon, what do you say
to that?

87
00:03:11,975 --> 00:03:13,942
I think we should
see other people.

88
00:03:16,813 --> 00:03:17,744
What?

89
00:03:17,745 --> 00:03:20,883
Well, as a male, I have
an evolutionary drive

90
00:03:20,884 --> 00:03:22,650
to perpetuate my DNA.

91
00:03:22,652 --> 00:03:26,387
Restricting myself to a single
partner is against my nature.

92
00:03:28,058 --> 00:03:29,757
We sleep together once a year!

93
00:03:29,759 --> 00:03:32,293
You want other partners?

94
00:03:32,295 --> 00:03:35,229
Don't blame me.
Blame your pal, biology.

95
00:03:35,231 --> 00:03:37,765
He's the pervert pulling
the strings here.

96
00:03:38,768 --> 00:03:41,313
You wanna see other people?
Go see other people.

97
00:03:41,751 --> 00:03:45,073
I hope one of those people is a
monkey, 'cause this is bananas.

98
00:03:46,352 --> 00:03:48,016
You can make jokes,
but if this keeps up,

99
00:03:48,017 --> 00:03:49,223
he's gonna move
back in here.

100
00:03:49,247 --> 00:03:51,012
All right. Well, let's just get them
apart for a while

101
00:03:51,014 --> 00:03:52,026
so they can cool down.

102
00:03:52,050 --> 00:03:52,915
Good.

103
00:03:52,916 --> 00:03:54,482
Then before we
reintroduce them,

104
00:03:54,484 --> 00:03:55,683
we'll give him one
of her sweaters

105
00:03:55,685 --> 00:03:58,186
so he can get used
to her scent again.

106
00:03:59,181 --> 00:04:01,789
So it's okay for you
to joke around?

107
00:04:01,791 --> 00:04:03,391
No, that's actually
what we did with him

108
00:04:03,393 --> 00:04:05,526
when Howard came
back from space.

109
00:04:07,731 --> 00:04:10,064
Honey, how ya feeling?

110
00:04:14,137 --> 00:04:16,204
The book says at this stage
of the pregnancy

111
00:04:16,206 --> 00:04:18,539
morning sickness
should be going away.

112
00:04:22,512 --> 00:04:25,480
So that's good news, right?

113
00:04:25,482 --> 00:04:29,217
The only thing I hate more than
you right now is that book!

114
00:04:33,289 --> 00:04:36,524
There she is!

115
00:04:36,526 --> 00:04:39,427
Who's ready for a hot,

116
00:04:39,429 --> 00:04:42,864
three-hour car ride
to the desert?

117
00:04:42,866 --> 00:04:46,367
Next vomit is gonna be
in your lap.

118
00:04:46,369 --> 00:04:49,037
I'm sorry.

119
00:04:49,039 --> 00:04:51,005
We don't have to go.

120
00:04:51,007 --> 00:04:53,207
But it's our last chance
to take a vacation

121
00:04:53,209 --> 00:04:55,476
that's just the two of us.

122
00:04:55,478 --> 00:04:57,645
How 'bout we stay here?

123
00:04:57,647 --> 00:04:59,347
We don't even have
to tell anyone.

124
00:04:59,349 --> 00:05:02,383
It'll be like
a secret vacation at home.

125
00:05:03,762 --> 00:05:04,887
Keeping secrets
from our friends...

126
00:05:04,888 --> 00:05:06,988
that does sound
kinda fun.

127
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:10,291
Does it sound... sexy?

128
00:05:15,098 --> 00:05:18,533
You just heard me
throwing up.

129
00:05:18,535 --> 00:05:21,869
You bet I did.

130
00:05:27,210 --> 00:05:30,511
You're so weird.

131
00:05:30,513 --> 00:05:32,547
You know what's weird?

132
00:05:36,853 --> 00:05:39,353
How turned on
you are right now.

133
00:05:42,158 --> 00:05:43,891
You know, people are quick
to accuse me

134
00:05:43,893 --> 00:05:45,293
of being difficult
to live with,

135
00:05:45,295 --> 00:05:47,995
but the truth is,
Amy is just as challenging.

136
00:05:47,997 --> 00:05:50,398
Just as challenging.

137
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,566
Yes.

138
00:05:51,568 --> 00:05:54,368
As you.

139
00:05:54,370 --> 00:05:55,736
Yes.

140
00:05:55,738 --> 00:05:58,539
Just as challenging as you.

141
00:06:00,643 --> 00:06:01,909
When we're sleeping,

142
00:06:01,911 --> 00:06:03,344
she breathes on me.

143
00:06:03,346 --> 00:06:05,680
One night, it got so bad
I almost grabbed Toto

144
00:06:05,682 --> 00:06:08,116
and headed for the storm cellar.

145
00:06:08,118 --> 00:06:10,118
Leonard breathes on me, too.

146
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,686
It's not a big deal.

147
00:06:11,688 --> 00:06:13,521
She's always complaining
about people at work.

148
00:06:13,523 --> 00:06:15,189
Well, so does Leonard.

149
00:06:15,191 --> 00:06:17,024
It's kind of annoying, but
it's not the end of the world.

150
00:06:17,026 --> 00:06:18,793
Do you know that when I get out
of the shower,

151
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:22,396
she eyes me up and down
like I'm a piece of meat?

152
00:06:22,398 --> 00:06:23,631
You know, so does Leonard.

153
00:06:23,633 --> 00:06:24,932
Can't I just get ready
in the morning

154
00:06:24,934 --> 00:06:26,801
without him giving me
his goofy thumbs-up?

155
00:06:26,803 --> 00:06:28,202
"Hey."

156
00:06:29,072 --> 00:06:30,905
I know.

157
00:06:30,907 --> 00:06:33,007
Sometimes I would just like
to be appreciated for my mind.

158
00:06:33,009 --> 00:06:36,410
Agreed!
Thank you!

159
00:06:38,848 --> 00:06:41,315
That feels great.

160
00:06:41,317 --> 00:06:42,650
Well,

161
00:06:42,652 --> 00:06:44,218
pulling a quarter out
of your ear

162
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:47,155
isn't the only magic
these hands can do.

163
00:06:47,157 --> 00:06:50,691
In fact, wh-what's this

164
00:06:50,693 --> 00:06:53,928
between your toes?

165
00:06:53,930 --> 00:06:57,798
Can you please stop making money
come out of me for two minutes?

166
00:07:03,907 --> 00:07:05,206
Was that the front door?

167
00:07:05,208 --> 00:07:07,208
It sounded like it.

168
00:07:07,210 --> 00:07:09,911
Oh, my God.
Someone's in the house.

169
00:07:09,913 --> 00:07:12,113
Lock the door, lock the door!

170
00:07:13,583 --> 00:07:15,816
- We should call the police.
- Uh...

171
00:07:15,818 --> 00:07:17,585
I left my phone downstairs.

172
00:07:17,587 --> 00:07:19,120
Damn, so did I.

173
00:07:19,122 --> 00:07:20,988
Wait, I have my iPad!
What are we gonna do,

174
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:23,257
e-mail 911?

175
00:07:23,259 --> 00:07:24,926
That's not helpful!

176
00:07:24,928 --> 00:07:25,927
You know I rely

177
00:07:25,929 --> 00:07:27,795
on humor in times of stress.

178
00:07:27,797 --> 00:07:30,364
Let me know when you start,
because that wasn't funny!

179
00:07:34,404 --> 00:07:36,304
Is that the hot tub?

180
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:39,640
Who would use
our hot tub?

181
00:07:40,910 --> 00:07:44,045
Well, the answer is both
more and less disturbing

182
00:07:44,047 --> 00:07:45,813
than you think.

183
00:07:45,815 --> 00:07:46,914
Who is it?

184
00:07:46,916 --> 00:07:48,082
Stuart.

185
00:07:51,154 --> 00:07:53,888
He heard me talking
about us going away.

186
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:57,425
I guess he decided
to invite himself over?

187
00:07:57,427 --> 00:07:59,293
Should we say something to him?

188
00:07:59,295 --> 00:08:01,395
Maybe. How 'bout,

189
00:08:01,397 --> 00:08:05,933
"Hey, you look like
a boiled chicken breast"?

190
00:08:07,203 --> 00:08:09,604
I meant like, "What
are you doing here?"

191
00:08:09,606 --> 00:08:12,974
Nah, that's not gonna
hurt his feelings.

192
00:08:14,143 --> 00:08:16,477
Why is nothing easy
with him?

193
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:20,748
Look, here's the thing you need
to understand about Sheldon:

194
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:23,217
he's the worst.

195
00:08:23,219 --> 00:08:26,454
I prefer to think of it
as high-maintenance.

196
00:08:26,456 --> 00:08:28,389
I prefer to think of myself
as five-ten,

197
00:08:28,391 --> 00:08:30,658
but I still need to get
all my pants hemmed.

198
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:34,362
I guess I should have known
what I was getting myself into.

199
00:08:34,364 --> 00:08:35,830
Don't beat yourself up.

200
00:08:35,832 --> 00:08:37,832
You've never lived
with anyone before.

201
00:08:37,834 --> 00:08:39,834
That's true.
And you're starting out

202
00:08:39,836 --> 00:08:41,836
with Sheldon Cooper.

203
00:08:41,838 --> 00:08:44,505
That's like getting your first
pet and having it be...

204
00:08:44,507 --> 00:08:46,507
I don't know...

205
00:08:46,509 --> 00:08:49,777
What's a kind of pet
that ruins your life?

206
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:52,313
You're not making me
feel better.

207
00:08:52,315 --> 00:08:55,082
Look, even when Penny and I
started living together,

208
00:08:55,084 --> 00:08:56,817
there was a-a learning curve.

209
00:08:56,819 --> 00:08:59,453
But I promise you,
it does get easier.

210
00:08:59,455 --> 00:09:01,389
He put a sign up in the bathroom
that says,

211
00:09:01,391 --> 00:09:05,359
"Number of days
without Amy's hair on the soap."

212
00:09:06,195 --> 00:09:07,728
Yeah.

213
00:09:07,730 --> 00:09:10,765
My record was six.

214
00:09:12,935 --> 00:09:14,935
Is it me,
or is there something fun

215
00:09:14,937 --> 00:09:17,171
about watching him
just float there?

216
00:09:20,009 --> 00:09:22,643
Maybe this is why
people get fish tanks.

217
00:09:24,747 --> 00:09:26,547
Who just turned
the porch lights on?

218
00:09:26,549 --> 00:09:28,716
Is someone else here?

219
00:09:31,521 --> 00:09:34,088
Hmm. They must have left
the tub on.

220
00:09:34,090 --> 00:09:35,923
Good thing I stopped by.

221
00:09:50,373 --> 00:09:53,040
Ah!

222
00:10:07,615 --> 00:10:09,916
What are you doing here?

223
00:10:10,626 --> 00:10:12,759
What are you doing here?

224
00:10:13,404 --> 00:10:16,772
Maybe Howard and Bernadette said
I could be here!

225
00:10:16,774 --> 00:10:18,708
Did they?

226
00:10:18,710 --> 00:10:21,410
Answer the question!
What are you doing here?

227
00:10:22,513 --> 00:10:25,214
I had nothing else
to do tonight.

228
00:10:25,216 --> 00:10:26,716
The last couple of months,

229
00:10:26,718 --> 00:10:29,085
I come here when I
know they're not home.

230
00:10:29,087 --> 00:10:30,119
What?

231
00:10:30,121 --> 00:10:31,654
They heard me in
the bushes once,

232
00:10:31,656 --> 00:10:33,890
but they thought
it was a raccoon.

233
00:10:35,193 --> 00:10:37,693
I told you raccoons
don't say "Uh-oh."

234
00:10:40,465 --> 00:10:43,299
You know, one night, Leonard's
nose whistled so loud,

235
00:10:43,301 --> 00:10:46,469
I swear it was like
sleeping on a train track.

236
00:10:46,471 --> 00:10:48,260
Have you noticed
it's always an A-flat?

237
00:10:48,284 --> 00:10:49,773
Is it?

238
00:10:49,774 --> 00:10:51,407
Oh!

239
00:10:51,409 --> 00:10:53,809
It's like his sinuses
are right here in the car.

240
00:10:53,811 --> 00:10:56,979
If we're just going
to drive around aimlessly,

241
00:10:56,981 --> 00:10:59,215
the least you could do is
take me for ice cream.

242
00:10:59,217 --> 00:11:00,883
Yeah, I'll take you
for ice cream.

243
00:11:00,885 --> 00:11:03,519
Well, see, why can't Amy be
that subservient?

244
00:11:03,521 --> 00:11:07,356
She has coitus one time,
suddenly she's Gloria Steinem.

245
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:11,060
Anyway, I suppose an ice cream
parlor will be a good place

246
00:11:11,062 --> 00:11:12,428
to meet other women.

247
00:11:12,430 --> 00:11:14,196
Oh, please, you're
barely interested

248
00:11:14,198 --> 00:11:15,865
in a physical relationship
with one person.

249
00:11:15,867 --> 00:11:19,735
Why would you want to confuse
and disappoint others?

250
00:11:19,737 --> 00:11:23,572
Being with Amy has awoken
the sexual creature within.

251
00:11:23,574 --> 00:11:26,909
When I see a pretty gal walking
down the street, I think,

252
00:11:26,911 --> 00:11:29,912
"hubba hubba"
like any other guy.

253
00:11:29,914 --> 00:11:33,015
You kiss your mother
with that mouth?

254
00:11:33,017 --> 00:11:34,283
'Cause it's fine.

255
00:11:36,788 --> 00:11:38,988
Here you go.

256
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:41,190
Thank you.

257
00:11:42,527 --> 00:11:44,160
Shall we toast?

258
00:11:44,162 --> 00:11:46,629
To Howard and Bernadette,

259
00:11:46,631 --> 00:11:49,832
and the house key they
never asked me to return.

260
00:11:51,336 --> 00:11:53,369
You said you got it back.

261
00:11:53,371 --> 00:11:56,806
Well, clearly, I lied.

262
00:11:58,376 --> 00:11:59,742
So how's your apartment?

263
00:11:59,744 --> 00:12:01,744
Not great. The
electricity's out.

264
00:12:01,746 --> 00:12:03,412
So why don't you get it fixed?

265
00:12:03,414 --> 00:12:08,184
I called, and they're
like, "Pay your bill!"

266
00:12:08,186 --> 00:12:11,320
Of you ever need somewhere to
crash, there's always my place.

267
00:12:11,322 --> 00:12:13,489
Oh, no. I don't want
to be an inconvenience.

268
00:12:13,491 --> 00:12:16,425
You've got all your
lady friends, and...

269
00:12:16,427 --> 00:12:18,394
Actually, I'm single now.

270
00:12:18,396 --> 00:12:19,562
What?

271
00:12:19,564 --> 00:12:20,830
When did that happen?

272
00:12:20,832 --> 00:12:22,732
It's okay. It's by choice.

273
00:12:22,734 --> 00:12:26,002
Well, their choice,
and it's not okay.

274
00:12:26,004 --> 00:12:28,604
Oh. Sorry.
I didn't know.

275
00:12:28,606 --> 00:12:32,341
Nobody does. I was embarrassed
so I didn't say anything.

276
00:12:32,343 --> 00:12:34,243
Why wouldn't he tell us?

277
00:12:34,245 --> 00:12:36,245
Are we bad friends?

278
00:12:36,247 --> 00:12:38,647
He's in our hot tub
drinking our wine.

279
00:12:38,649 --> 00:12:41,317
Yeah, he deserves
to be alone.

280
00:12:42,687 --> 00:12:45,554
So you're back out
on the dating scene now?

281
00:12:45,556 --> 00:12:47,523
Yeah, yeah, a little.

282
00:12:47,525 --> 00:12:49,392
Oh, that must be fun.
How's that going?

283
00:12:49,394 --> 00:12:52,061
I'm in a hot tub with you,
so pretty bad.

284
00:12:55,066 --> 00:12:57,767
Maybe I should just give in
to his stupid bathroom schedule.

285
00:12:57,769 --> 00:12:59,402
No, don't do that.

286
00:12:59,404 --> 00:13:01,370
- But you did!
- Exactly!

287
00:13:01,372 --> 00:13:04,006
Learn from my mistakes!

288
00:13:04,008 --> 00:13:06,976
No matter where
I am at 7:18 a.m.,

289
00:13:06,978 --> 00:13:09,612
there better be
a toilet nearby.

290
00:13:12,216 --> 00:13:15,017
It's just so much easier
to give him what he wants.

291
00:13:15,019 --> 00:13:18,654
Oh, true, but think of how
much you've accomplished.

292
00:13:18,656 --> 00:13:21,223
Who got him to stop
Purelling his pocket change?

293
00:13:21,225 --> 00:13:23,225
Me.

294
00:13:23,227 --> 00:13:25,327
And who got him to put
things other than gloves

295
00:13:25,329 --> 00:13:27,063
in the glove compartment?

296
00:13:27,065 --> 00:13:28,998
Me.

297
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,666
It was mittens.

298
00:13:30,668 --> 00:13:31,967
Mm.

299
00:13:31,969 --> 00:13:34,103
And who got him to
try a turkey dog?

300
00:13:34,105 --> 00:13:35,304
That was actually Koothrappali,

301
00:13:35,306 --> 00:13:37,940
but I did let him spit it out
in my hand.

302
00:13:37,942 --> 00:13:41,177
Look, how can you stop now?

303
00:13:41,179 --> 00:13:42,711
That's like walking
out of Pinocchio

304
00:13:42,713 --> 00:13:45,281
right before he
becomes a real boy.

305
00:13:45,283 --> 00:13:46,782
You know, you're right.

306
00:13:46,784 --> 00:13:48,384
I'm in this relationship, too.

307
00:13:48,386 --> 00:13:49,385
I need to stand up for myself.

308
00:13:49,386 --> 00:13:50,392
Of course you do.

309
00:13:50,393 --> 00:13:53,222
And if he doesn't like it,
he can move back here.

310
00:13:53,224 --> 00:13:57,226
Oh. He can try. He'd just
need a good locksmith.

311
00:13:59,997 --> 00:14:02,798
Well, who you
gonna hit on?

312
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,767
The girl in front of
us got strawberry.

313
00:14:04,769 --> 00:14:06,802
That's your favorite.

314
00:14:06,804 --> 00:14:10,606
No. No, if we both like it,
I'll spend the rest of my life

315
00:14:10,608 --> 00:14:14,343
opening the freezer and going,
"Aw, no strawberry."

316
00:14:14,345 --> 00:14:17,146
What about the girl
behind the counter?

317
00:14:17,148 --> 00:14:19,548
Hmm? Well, she spends
her whole day scooping.

318
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:23,419
One arm's probably
bigger than the other.

319
00:14:23,421 --> 00:14:26,856
Is it possible you might not
actually want to meet someone?

320
00:14:28,459 --> 00:14:30,993
You are truly wise.

321
00:14:30,995 --> 00:14:31,774
Thank you.

322
00:14:31,798 --> 00:14:33,096
I'd say

323
00:14:33,097 --> 00:14:34,119
wise beyond your years,
but you're getting up there.

324
00:14:34,143 --> 00:14:35,369
All right.

325
00:14:36,567 --> 00:14:40,002
Come on. What is really
going on with you?

326
00:14:41,873 --> 00:14:44,673
Penny, I am going
to tell you a story

327
00:14:44,675 --> 00:14:45,941
that I've never told anyone.

328
00:14:45,943 --> 00:14:47,510
All right.

329
00:14:47,512 --> 00:14:49,845
I was 13 years old,

330
00:14:49,847 --> 00:14:52,848
and on spring break
from college.

331
00:14:56,821 --> 00:14:58,787
Not relating. Go on.

332
00:14:58,789 --> 00:15:03,192
I came home early because they
ran out of math to teach me.

333
00:15:03,194 --> 00:15:05,227
Oh, now I'm with ya. Okay.

334
00:15:05,229 --> 00:15:07,129
My mother was at bible study.

335
00:15:07,131 --> 00:15:09,765
I walked in the house
expecting to find it empty,

336
00:15:09,767 --> 00:15:13,602
and I heard a sound coming
from my parents' bedroom.

337
00:15:13,604 --> 00:15:15,437
When I opened the door,

338
00:15:15,439 --> 00:15:19,008
I saw my father having relations
with another woman.

339
00:15:19,010 --> 00:15:22,111
Oh, that's awful!
I know.

340
00:15:22,113 --> 00:15:24,079
It's also why
I never open a door

341
00:15:24,081 --> 00:15:25,748
without knocking three times.

342
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:27,683
I mean, the first
one's traditional,

343
00:15:27,685 --> 00:15:31,020
but two and three are for people
to get their pants on.

344
00:15:31,022 --> 00:15:34,356
Well, what happened
with your dad?

345
00:15:34,358 --> 00:15:37,459
We locked eyes,
I ran to my room,

346
00:15:37,461 --> 00:15:40,162
and we never, ever spoke of it.

347
00:15:40,164 --> 00:15:42,064
You poor thing.

348
00:15:42,066 --> 00:15:44,567
Since Amy and I
have been living together,

349
00:15:44,569 --> 00:15:47,102
we've been bickering
like my parents used to.

350
00:15:47,104 --> 00:15:50,472
And you're afraid you're gonna
do something like your dad did?

351
00:15:50,474 --> 00:15:53,108
Yes. I need to prepare her now

352
00:15:53,110 --> 00:15:55,036
to save her from pain
down the road.

353
00:15:55,060 --> 00:15:56,279
Down the road?

354
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:59,048
Sheldon, she wanted to share a
toothbrush holder with you,

355
00:15:59,050 --> 00:16:02,718
and now you're at an ice cream
parlor trying to pick up women!

356
00:16:04,488 --> 00:16:07,456
Well, anything can sound silly
when you put it in that tone.

357
00:16:07,458 --> 00:16:09,491
Honey, instead of
worrying about pain

358
00:16:09,493 --> 00:16:11,594
you might cause in the
future, how about trying

359
00:16:11,596 --> 00:16:13,762
to fix the pain you're
causing her right now?

360
00:16:15,533 --> 00:16:18,133
I'm sure you're right.

361
00:16:18,135 --> 00:16:21,070
I suppose I should
apologize to you, as well.

362
00:16:21,072 --> 00:16:22,705
Okay.

363
00:16:22,707 --> 00:16:25,674
That must have hurt watching me
look for other women

364
00:16:25,676 --> 00:16:28,577
without ever even
considering you.

365
00:16:32,883 --> 00:16:35,784
Please understand
that I think of you

366
00:16:35,786 --> 00:16:39,088
as more of a nanny.

367
00:16:39,090 --> 00:16:43,292
Just finish your ice cream
so I can get you home to bed.

368
00:16:48,366 --> 00:16:50,499
I wonder if this is
what it feels like

369
00:16:50,501 --> 00:16:53,002
to be Bernadette's baby.

370
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:57,673
I don't know. Bernadette's baby
doesn't have a Jacuzzi jet

371
00:16:57,675 --> 00:16:59,942
hitting just the right spot.

372
00:17:01,912 --> 00:17:06,115
Those jets are
for my secret spot, not his!

373
00:17:06,117 --> 00:17:08,417
What do you do in there?

374
00:17:08,419 --> 00:17:12,454
It's called relaxing,
and that's all you need to know.

375
00:17:14,892 --> 00:17:17,159
Well, it's getting late.

376
00:17:17,161 --> 00:17:19,428
Maybe we should head home.

377
00:17:19,430 --> 00:17:22,164
Yeah, you're probably right.

378
00:17:23,634 --> 00:17:25,367
You coming?

379
00:17:25,369 --> 00:17:27,169
Yeah, just give me a minute.

380
00:17:27,171 --> 00:17:28,404
Why?

381
00:17:28,406 --> 00:17:32,041
Well, you know how
you're wearing a bathing suit?

382
00:17:32,043 --> 00:17:33,976
Yeah?

383
00:17:33,978 --> 00:17:37,046
I kind of went the other way.

384
00:17:38,215 --> 00:17:40,783
You jackasses just bought
yourselves a hot tub!

385
00:17:53,432 --> 00:17:55,165
What do you think?

386
00:17:55,167 --> 00:17:56,400
It's a nice enough spot.

387
00:17:56,402 --> 00:17:58,635
You know, if I'm going to start
standing up for myself,

388
00:17:58,637 --> 00:17:59,563
this is exactly
the kind of thing...

389
00:17:59,564 --> 00:18:00,335
We're back!

390
00:18:00,359 --> 00:18:01,981
Oh, hi! Hi!

391
00:18:04,143 --> 00:18:05,648
Hello.

392
00:18:05,649 --> 00:18:06,815
How you guys doing?

393
00:18:06,817 --> 00:18:07,983
We're doing good. I think

394
00:18:07,985 --> 00:18:09,785
Sheldon has something he
would like to say to Amy.

395
00:18:14,425 --> 00:18:18,660
I wanted to apologize
for my behavior today. It...

396
00:18:25,502 --> 00:18:29,004
It was unnecessary.

397
00:18:29,006 --> 00:18:32,307
This is warm.

398
00:18:33,944 --> 00:18:39,181
Oh, and also, I am willing to
forego the bathroom schedule.

399
00:18:39,183 --> 00:18:41,450
Oh. Really?

400
00:18:41,452 --> 00:18:43,652
Why does she get that?
We never got that!

401
00:18:43,654 --> 00:18:45,353
Do you want him back?

402
00:18:45,355 --> 00:18:47,456
I'm very happy for you.

403
00:18:48,192 --> 00:18:50,959
Amy, you should know

404
00:18:50,961 --> 00:18:53,328
I was never really interested
in seeing other women.

405
00:18:53,330 --> 00:18:57,032
And to prove how
serious I am about us,

406
00:18:57,034 --> 00:19:00,769
I'm willing to take our
relationship to the next level.

407
00:19:02,072 --> 00:19:04,272
Amy Farrah Fowler,

408
00:19:04,274 --> 00:19:07,409
will you share
this toothbrush holder with me?

409
00:19:10,147 --> 00:19:12,314
I would love to.

410
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:18,487
Did we really

411
00:19:18,489 --> 00:19:21,189
need to be
here for this?

412
00:19:21,191 --> 00:19:24,359
Call me crazy,
but I found it moving.

413
00:19:27,933 --> 00:19:34,733
