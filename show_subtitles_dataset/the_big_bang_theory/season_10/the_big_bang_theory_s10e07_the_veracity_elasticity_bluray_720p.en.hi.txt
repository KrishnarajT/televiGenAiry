00:00:02,371 --> 00:00:04,270
And I'm Dr. Amy Farrah Fowler.

2
00:00:04,271 --> 00:00:07,340
And welcome to the first
"on location" episode of

Dr. Amy Farrah Fowler present:

00:00:10,812 --> 00:00:15,315

00:00:46,781 --> 00:00:49,449
As you may notice, just one
of the changes around here

20
00:00:49,451 --> 00:00:51,951
is our new house band.

21
00:00:54,689 --> 00:00:57,723
Who haven't learned
their place yet.

22
00:01:00,761 --> 00:01:04,397
We're also coming to you
live from a different apartment.

23
00:01:04,398 --> 00:01:07,699
Dr. Fowler and I began an
experiment in living together

24
00:01:07,701 --> 00:01:10,103
after her apartment
became water damaged.

25
00:01:10,104 --> 00:01:12,371
This is our
friend Penny's place.

26
00:01:12,374 --> 00:01:14,473
You may remember her
from our episode

27
00:01:14,475 --> 00:01:18,844
And the People
Who Don't Understand Them."

28
00:01:18,847 --> 00:01:20,913
So, in the spirit
of cohabitation,

29
00:01:20,915 --> 00:01:23,916
the theme of today's episode
is flags of two regions

30
00:01:23,919 --> 00:01:26,085
coming together as one.

31
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:29,755
Such as the flag of
St. Kitts and Nevis.

32
00:01:29,758 --> 00:01:34,226
So, let's roll up our
"sleevis" and get to know Nevis.

33
00:01:37,398 --> 00:01:40,300
Well, I-I like that, but
next time check with me.

34
00:01:41,735 --> 00:01:43,603
Did you know that the flag

35
00:01:43,604 --> 00:01:45,538
was designed by a student
named Edrice Lewis...

36
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:47,407
I can't believe I'm saying this,
but can we watch the news

37
00:01:47,409 --> 00:01:50,376
or something?

38
00:01:50,378 --> 00:01:53,178
It's cute, they're having
fun living together.

39
00:01:53,181 --> 00:01:54,213
Yeah, I wonder what
they're gonna do

40
00:01:54,216 --> 00:01:55,814
when her apartment's ready.

41
00:01:55,817 --> 00:01:57,583
Actually, it's been
ready for weeks.

42
00:01:57,585 --> 00:01:58,651
What do you mean?

43
00:01:58,653 --> 00:02:00,520
Well, they finished
the work early,

44
00:02:00,522 --> 00:02:02,555
but she's been telling Sheldon
they're behind schedule.

45
00:02:02,556 --> 00:02:05,091
So, she's just
been lying to him?

46
00:02:05,093 --> 00:02:06,593
Well, you've lied to Sheldon.

47
00:02:06,594 --> 00:02:08,061
Yeah, but to make him leave,

48
00:02:08,063 --> 00:02:09,962
not to make him stay.

49
00:02:11,633 --> 00:02:16,101
Buda and Pest
united to form Budapest.

50
00:02:16,104 --> 00:02:18,104
And that's why Budapest

51
00:02:18,105 --> 00:02:20,306
"Budabest."

52
00:02:22,676 --> 00:02:23,575
Now.

53
00:02:23,577 --> 00:02:26,813

@elder_man

64
00:02:57,772 --> 00:03:00,051
Thank you for your services,
gentlemen.

65
00:03:00,051 --> 00:03:01,083
Now, I'm hoping

66
00:03:01,086 --> 00:03:02,085
to broaden our audience

67
00:03:02,087 --> 00:03:04,955
with your youthful
rock and roll music.

68
00:03:04,956 --> 00:03:06,390
Aw,

69
00:03:06,391 --> 00:03:08,425
you think you have
an audience, that's funny.

70
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:12,729
We don't get paid?
Nothing?

71
00:03:12,730 --> 00:03:14,665
Not even a sandwich?

72
00:03:16,968 --> 00:03:18,868
It's almost dinner time.

73
00:03:18,871 --> 00:03:20,336
You in the mood for anything?

74
00:03:20,338 --> 00:03:22,605
Yeah, we could get Thai food
near your apartment

75
00:03:22,607 --> 00:03:24,775
and then drop in and
check on the progress.

76
00:03:26,077 --> 00:03:30,347
Oh, you don't want do that,
it's a construction zone.

77
00:03:30,348 --> 00:03:31,682
So?

78
00:03:31,683 --> 00:03:35,952
Well, what about your fear of
stray nails and butt cracks?

79
00:03:35,955 --> 00:03:38,121
I am terrified of
stepping on a nail

80
00:03:38,122 --> 00:03:39,790
and falling into a butt crack.

81
00:03:41,627 --> 00:03:44,561
Anyway, how about dinner?

82
00:03:44,562 --> 00:03:45,829
You know, if
you'd like, I could

83
00:03:45,831 --> 00:03:47,598
call your landlord and complain.

84
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:50,300
Thanks, but you don't have to.

85
00:03:50,302 --> 00:03:52,702
Oh, I don't mind, I'm very good
at complaining.

86
00:03:53,906 --> 00:03:55,939
If it were an Olympic sport,
I'd complain about

87
00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:58,374
what a stupid sport it is
and then I'd take home the gold.

88
00:03:59,812 --> 00:04:01,812
Good stuff.

89
00:04:01,813 --> 00:04:05,848
So, uh, what about dinner?

90
00:04:05,850 --> 00:04:06,884
Is it me

91
00:04:06,885 --> 00:04:09,218
or are you purposely
changing the subject?

92
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:11,220
No.

93
00:04:11,223 --> 00:04:12,990
And on the subject of subjects,

94
00:04:12,992 --> 00:04:15,692
is your use of the word
"subject" the same or different

95
00:04:15,694 --> 00:04:18,829
as when we speak about
the subject of a king?

96
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:25,067
I have a feeling
you're still doing it.

97
00:04:25,069 --> 00:04:27,271
But I find that topic
irresistible, so,

98
00:04:27,273 --> 00:04:29,540
now, in ancient Mesopotamia,

99
00:04:29,542 --> 00:04:33,509
the king referred to the people
as his property.

100
00:04:34,713 --> 00:04:35,978
I'm serious,

101
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:38,348
JPL's actually
developing a robot arm

102
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:40,483
that could grab an asteroid
before it hits us.

103
00:04:40,485 --> 00:04:44,588
So their plan for saving
the Earth from Armageddon

104
00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:48,792
is hoping a bunch of
scientists can catch a ball?

105
00:04:48,793 --> 00:04:52,194
If we're all gonna die,
why am I eating so much kale?

106
00:04:53,365 --> 00:04:55,331
You're awful quiet,
everything okay?

107
00:04:55,333 --> 00:04:58,434
I'm concerned about Amy.

108
00:04:58,437 --> 00:05:00,237
She's acting a bit odd lately.

109
00:05:00,239 --> 00:05:02,506
Oh. Well, j-just
out of curiosity,

110
00:05:02,507 --> 00:05:06,143
what registers as odd to you?

111
00:05:09,348 --> 00:05:11,715
Her behavior.

112
00:05:11,716 --> 00:05:14,384
No, I have the feeling
that she's hiding something.

113
00:05:14,386 --> 00:05:15,886
I wouldn't worry about it.

114
00:05:15,888 --> 00:05:17,888
She's probably just
distracted by work.

115
00:05:17,889 --> 00:05:19,990
Well, whatever it is,
it's troubling me.

116
00:05:19,992 --> 00:05:21,658
And I can't eat, I can't sleep.

117
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:23,125
And don't even ask
about the consistency

118
00:05:23,127 --> 00:05:25,127
of my bowel movements.

119
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:29,800
You heard him, guys,
don't ask.

120
00:05:29,802 --> 00:05:32,336
Why would she keep
something from me, you know?

121
00:05:32,338 --> 00:05:34,838
I shared my body
with that woman.

122
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:38,007
And my Netflix password.

123
00:05:38,009 --> 00:05:39,675
They recommended
Stella Got Her Groove Back

124
00:05:39,677 --> 00:05:42,011
because of her.

125
00:05:42,881 --> 00:05:44,581
Buddy, buddy, listen,

126
00:05:44,583 --> 00:05:46,148
nothing bad is going on,

127
00:05:46,151 --> 00:05:48,985
she just... she just
didn't want you to know

128
00:05:48,987 --> 00:05:52,189
that the work on her apartment
was finished a couple weeks ago.

129
00:05:52,191 --> 00:05:55,124
I don't understand.

130
00:05:55,127 --> 00:05:57,026
She's enjoying living with you

131
00:05:57,028 --> 00:05:59,028
and she didn't want it
to end early.

132
00:05:59,031 --> 00:06:01,898
So, she's deceiving me

133
00:06:01,899 --> 00:06:04,367
in order to spend
more time with me.

134
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:06,370
Yes.
Oh.

135
00:06:06,372 --> 00:06:10,841
Well, I feel both
flattered and hurt.

136
00:06:10,843 --> 00:06:12,375
Like when people say I
look like that skeleton

137
00:06:12,377 --> 00:06:15,978
from Nightmare Before Christmas.

138
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:18,581
Oh my God, that's
who you look like.

139
00:06:19,951 --> 00:06:21,718
Sheldon, this is not a big deal.

140
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:23,185
It's a little white lie,
everyone does it.

141
00:06:23,187 --> 00:06:24,287
Not me,

142
00:06:24,288 --> 00:06:25,721
I'm a 100% honest

143
00:06:25,723 --> 00:06:27,324
in all of my
relationships.

144
00:06:27,326 --> 00:06:29,225
And how single
are you right now?

145
00:06:29,228 --> 00:06:32,963
Eating-cake-on-the-toilet
single.

146
00:06:34,732 --> 00:06:37,199
Well, I won't tolerate
deception in my relationship.

147
00:06:37,201 --> 00:06:39,136
I have no choice
but to confront her.

148
00:06:39,138 --> 00:06:42,004
Don't do that,
you've got gold here.

149
00:06:42,007 --> 00:06:43,706
Hang onto it until
you're in trouble

150
00:06:43,708 --> 00:06:46,076
and then...
throw it in her face.

151
00:06:46,077 --> 00:06:47,144
What?

152
00:06:47,146 --> 00:06:49,045
Why would you tell him that?

153
00:06:49,047 --> 00:06:50,346
That's terrible advice.

154
00:06:50,348 --> 00:06:54,016
So you wouldn't want to
have anything on Penny?

155
00:06:54,019 --> 00:06:55,552
Well, of course not.

156
00:06:55,553 --> 00:06:59,689
So, if I actually
know something right now...

157
00:06:59,692 --> 00:07:01,257
and I do...

158
00:07:02,961 --> 00:07:04,127
you don't want me
to tell you?

159
00:07:04,129 --> 00:07:06,362
Uh...

160
00:07:06,365 --> 00:07:07,764
Pfft, no.

161
00:07:07,766 --> 00:07:10,499
I'll take that as a "Yes."

162
00:07:10,502 --> 00:07:13,537
She's secretly been moving
your collectibles into storage

163
00:07:13,538 --> 00:07:15,338
a little at a time
and you haven't noticed.

164
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:17,307
Are you kidding me?

165
00:07:17,309 --> 00:07:18,742
See, I've known
that for weeks,

166
00:07:18,744 --> 00:07:21,011
but, you know, I waited
till the moment

167
00:07:21,013 --> 00:07:24,648
when it would cause him
the most pain.

168
00:07:29,654 --> 00:07:32,723
Superman's gone,
my stormtrooper's gone.

169
00:07:32,725 --> 00:07:35,492
Your Klingon word-of-the-day
calendar's gone.

170
00:07:35,494 --> 00:07:37,360
I'd say "damn it" in Klingon,

171
00:07:37,362 --> 00:07:39,362
but that wasn't until
next month.

172
00:07:39,364 --> 00:07:41,163
It's "khoo-vakh."

173
00:07:41,165 --> 00:07:43,333
Khoo-vakh!

174
00:07:43,335 --> 00:07:45,701
She took my Where's Waldo.

175
00:07:45,704 --> 00:07:47,002
Well, no, no, he's over there.

176
00:07:47,004 --> 00:07:50,439
Oh, yeah, there he is.

177
00:07:51,610 --> 00:07:54,745
So, what's the deal
with your apartment?

178
00:07:54,747 --> 00:07:56,345
Why's it taking so long?

179
00:07:56,348 --> 00:07:59,415
Um, it was a drywall problem.

180
00:07:59,418 --> 00:08:02,886
Oh, no, what happened?

181
00:08:02,887 --> 00:08:07,790
Well, the drywall got wet,
and you do not want wet drywall

182
00:08:07,793 --> 00:08:11,894
because when drywall gets
wet, it's really more...

183
00:08:11,896 --> 00:08:14,730
Wet wall?

184
00:08:14,732 --> 00:08:18,535
Or damp wall, just as bad.
Mm.

185
00:08:18,537 --> 00:08:21,771
So why don't they
just get more drywall?

186
00:08:21,773 --> 00:08:24,507
Well, they went to get some,

187
00:08:24,509 --> 00:08:28,812
but the woman at the wall store

188
00:08:28,813 --> 00:08:30,480
said it was going on sale
and they should wait

189
00:08:30,481 --> 00:08:33,450
because the savings...
Okay, are you done?

190
00:08:33,451 --> 00:08:35,185
Bernadette told me
your apartment's ready.

191
00:08:35,187 --> 00:08:39,156
I was done at wet wall,
but you wouldn't let it go.

192
00:08:39,158 --> 00:08:42,024
But is Sheldon really
believing all this crap?

193
00:08:42,027 --> 00:08:44,794
Well, he started to question it,
but then I fake sneezed on him

194
00:08:44,797 --> 00:08:47,797
and he ran to take a shower.

195
00:08:47,799 --> 00:08:50,567
Please don't say anything,
I feel terrible about this.

196
00:08:50,568 --> 00:08:51,768
Oh, don't worry, I won't.

197
00:08:51,769 --> 00:08:52,936
Thanks.

198
00:08:54,472 --> 00:08:58,274
"The woman at the wall store?"
Let it go!

199
00:09:00,479 --> 00:09:02,211
Are you going to confront Penny?

200
00:09:02,214 --> 00:09:03,779
Eventually, I guess.

201
00:09:03,782 --> 00:09:06,182
Although, I am kind of curious
how long she thinks

202
00:09:06,185 --> 00:09:08,250
she can keep hiding my stuff
without me knowing.

203
00:09:08,253 --> 00:09:09,952
Hmm.

204
00:09:09,955 --> 00:09:13,123
You know, perhaps
instead of confronting them,

205
00:09:13,124 --> 00:09:15,024
we should see how far
they're willing to spin

206
00:09:15,027 --> 00:09:16,560
their tangled webs.

207
00:09:16,562 --> 00:09:18,161
Like that
Spider-Man action figure

208
00:09:18,163 --> 00:09:20,831
that used to be on your desk.

209
00:09:20,832 --> 00:09:23,700
Oh, my God, I'm going blind.

210
00:09:24,602 --> 00:09:26,602
Hi.
Food's here.

211
00:09:26,605 --> 00:09:28,404
Oh.

212
00:09:28,407 --> 00:09:29,272
Excellent.

213
00:09:29,273 --> 00:09:31,740
I'm very hungry.

214
00:09:31,743 --> 00:09:32,808
Yeah, speaking of which,

215
00:09:32,811 --> 00:09:34,711
what's going on
with your apartment?

216
00:09:34,712 --> 00:09:38,447
Oh, uh, they're still
working on it.

217
00:09:38,450 --> 00:09:39,648
Interesting.

218
00:09:39,650 --> 00:09:42,219
Very interesting.

219
00:09:44,022 --> 00:09:45,922
Yeah, we swung by her apartment
on the way to the restaurant,

220
00:09:45,923 --> 00:09:47,224
and they're gonna be fixing it
for a while.

221
00:09:47,225 --> 00:09:51,061
Wait, uh...
you saw her apartment?

222
00:09:51,062 --> 00:09:53,429
I did, still a mess.

223
00:09:57,436 --> 00:09:59,402
Leonard?
Yeah?

224
00:10:13,384 --> 00:10:14,918
W-Why are you
speaking Klingon?

225
00:10:14,919 --> 00:10:18,020
Why are you speaking English?

226
00:10:19,157 --> 00:10:20,156
This is ridiculous.

227
00:10:20,158 --> 00:10:21,523
Penny, do you remember

228
00:10:21,525 --> 00:10:22,658
when I taught you Ubbi Dubbi?

229
00:10:40,678 --> 00:10:41,945
Oh, wait, stop that.

230
00:10:41,946 --> 00:10:43,079
You stop that.

231
00:10:47,152 --> 00:10:48,384
Okay.

232
00:10:48,387 --> 00:10:50,019
That's enough.
You know what?

233
00:10:50,855 --> 00:10:52,187
What is going on?

234
00:10:52,190 --> 00:10:54,190
Fine, I told
Sheldon that

235
00:10:54,192 --> 00:10:55,358
her apartment's
been finished,

236
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,759
but then you just said it's not,

237
00:10:56,762 --> 00:10:57,626
so now I'm all confused.

238
00:10:57,629 --> 00:11:00,629
Penny was just
covering for me.

239
00:11:00,631 --> 00:11:02,666
My place has been
ready for two weeks.

240
00:11:02,668 --> 00:11:04,366
How could you lie to me?

241
00:11:04,369 --> 00:11:05,435
Uh, she's enjoyed
living with you.

242
00:11:05,437 --> 00:11:06,735
It's called being in love.

243
00:11:06,738 --> 00:11:08,304
Mm-hmm, and
what's it called

244
00:11:08,307 --> 00:11:09,405
when you
secretly get rid

245
00:11:09,408 --> 00:11:10,840
of all your
husband's stuff?

246
00:11:10,841 --> 00:11:12,975
Wha... That is not true!

247
00:11:12,977 --> 00:11:14,778
Wh-wh-wh... Bernadette
told Howard, Howard told me.

248
00:11:14,779 --> 00:11:17,179
Plus, I can see
all my stuff is gone!

249
00:11:17,182 --> 00:11:20,283
Oh, so, you believe your friend,
and your friend's wife

250
00:11:20,284 --> 00:11:22,251
and your own eyes over me?

251
00:11:24,432 --> 00:11:25,548
Wow.

252
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:37,567
You really didn't
think I'd notice

253
00:11:37,568 --> 00:11:38,868
my stuff was missing?

254
00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:40,937
Uh, did you notice
your key chain?

255
00:11:45,344 --> 00:11:47,443
Where's Batman?

256
00:11:48,446 --> 00:11:50,279
Hey.

257
00:11:50,282 --> 00:11:51,281
Why did you tell Howard

258
00:11:51,283 --> 00:11:52,514
I was hiding
Leonard's things?

259
00:11:52,517 --> 00:11:53,249
One sec.

260
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:54,283
Why did you tell Leonard

261
00:11:54,285 --> 00:11:56,418
I told you Penny was
hiding his things?

262
00:11:57,321 --> 00:11:58,421
It just came up

263
00:11:58,422 --> 00:12:00,923
because we-we were talking
about secrets and...

264
00:12:00,926 --> 00:12:02,258
Wait.

265
00:12:03,595 --> 00:12:05,662
Everybody
stop it with that!

266
00:12:06,530 --> 00:12:08,297
I'm not really a part of this,

267
00:12:08,299 --> 00:12:10,567
so I'm just gonna dig in.

268
00:12:11,436 --> 00:12:12,836
And I'd like to know
why you blabbed

269
00:12:12,837 --> 00:12:14,336
about my apartment.

270
00:12:14,339 --> 00:12:15,705
You're up, blabby.

271
00:12:17,075 --> 00:12:19,743
Amy, I'm sorry, I shouldn't
have said anything.

272
00:12:20,644 --> 00:12:22,644
I guess it's okay.

273
00:12:22,647 --> 00:12:24,380
I'm sorry

274
00:12:24,383 --> 00:12:26,716
that I lied about
my apartment.

275
00:12:26,717 --> 00:12:28,685
It's all right.

276
00:12:28,687 --> 00:12:29,952
And...

277
00:12:29,955 --> 00:12:30,919
And what?

278
00:12:30,922 --> 00:12:32,821
Your wizard robes
are next to go.

279
00:12:34,625 --> 00:12:36,759
Now that everything's
out on the table,

280
00:12:36,762 --> 00:12:39,629
you-you think you two
will keep living together?

281
00:12:40,465 --> 00:12:42,966
Despite recent events,

282
00:12:42,967 --> 00:12:44,734
I do consider our experiment

283
00:12:44,735 --> 00:12:47,269
in cohabitation
to have been positive.

284
00:12:47,272 --> 00:12:50,206
Are you saying you'd like
to live with me?

285
00:12:50,207 --> 00:12:52,841
I'm open to the possibility.

286
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:57,880
Whatever.

287
00:13:00,951 --> 00:13:03,153
You know, if he moves
across the hall for good,

288
00:13:03,154 --> 00:13:04,354
Leonard could keep the
stuff you don't like

289
00:13:04,355 --> 00:13:05,455
in Sheldon's old room.

290
00:13:05,456 --> 00:13:06,922
Solves everything.
That's a great idea!

291
00:13:06,924 --> 00:13:09,591
Ooh, maybe I could turn it
into a gaming den.

292
00:13:09,594 --> 00:13:10,493
That would be amazing.

293
00:13:10,495 --> 00:13:11,561
Wait, wait,
hold on, do what?

294
00:13:11,562 --> 00:13:13,897
Excuse me...
that's my room.

295
00:13:13,898 --> 00:13:15,197
But you won't be living here.

296
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,633
But that's my room.

297
00:13:16,634 --> 00:13:18,168
But you won't be living here.
But that's my room.

298
00:13:18,169 --> 00:13:19,436
You guys might want
to start eating.

299
00:13:19,437 --> 00:13:20,870
But you won't be living here.

300
00:13:22,039 --> 00:13:23,406
Sweetie,
once you stop paying rent,

301
00:13:23,408 --> 00:13:25,008
none of this is really yours.

302
00:13:25,009 --> 00:13:26,142
But that's my room.

303
00:13:26,144 --> 00:13:28,378
But you won't be living here!

304
00:13:30,715 --> 00:13:33,383
Thank you
for understanding.

305
00:13:33,384 --> 00:13:35,018
Hey, I get it.

306
00:13:35,019 --> 00:13:37,854
Everybody wants to spend
more time with me.

307
00:13:39,291 --> 00:13:41,825
I'm like a man made of sugar
in a world of ants.

308
00:13:43,128 --> 00:13:44,126
Good night.

309
00:13:44,129 --> 00:13:46,262
Mm, night.

310
00:13:57,108 --> 00:14:00,176
If we did continue
living together,

311
00:14:00,177 --> 00:14:01,711
would it be here?

312
00:14:03,447 --> 00:14:04,547
I don't know.

313
00:14:04,548 --> 00:14:06,648
It-It could be.

314
00:14:06,650 --> 00:14:07,584
Of course there's...

315
00:14:07,586 --> 00:14:10,119
there's always
your apartment.

316
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:13,355
S-Sure, sure, we-we could
live in my apartment.

317
00:14:13,358 --> 00:14:15,758
I hate your apartment.

318
00:14:16,561 --> 00:14:19,262
Sorry, you brought it up?

319
00:14:19,264 --> 00:14:22,599
Well, I suppose we could
find a whole new place.

320
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:23,799
You know, and, technically,

321
00:14:23,802 --> 00:14:25,467
we don't even have to stay
in Pasadena.

322
00:14:25,470 --> 00:14:28,370
We could, we could move
to Altadena...

323
00:14:28,373 --> 00:14:31,341
or a place that doesn't
even end in "Dena."

324
00:14:31,342 --> 00:14:33,076
It's kind of exciting.

325
00:14:33,077 --> 00:14:36,111
I mean... we could do
whatever we want.

326
00:14:36,947 --> 00:14:38,214
But what if we move

327
00:14:38,216 --> 00:14:40,015
and we don't like it?

328
00:14:40,018 --> 00:14:41,985
What if there's a smoker
in the building?

329
00:14:41,986 --> 00:14:43,086
Or pets?

330
00:14:43,087 --> 00:14:45,621
Or there could be mold.

331
00:14:45,624 --> 00:14:47,289
There could be traffic noise.

332
00:14:47,292 --> 00:14:50,125
I'm gonna have to learn
a whole new bus route.

333
00:14:56,234 --> 00:14:58,134
Are you trying to soothe me

334
00:14:58,135 --> 00:15:00,769
by singing the Star Trek
theme as a lullaby?

335
00:15:01,639 --> 00:15:02,772
Yes.

336
00:15:02,773 --> 00:15:05,374
I'm not a child,
don't do that.

337
00:15:05,376 --> 00:15:07,110
Sorry.

338
00:15:10,849 --> 00:15:14,283
Do you know 2001:
A Space Odyssey?

339
00:15:25,263 --> 00:15:26,929
All right, now
that's soothing.

340
00:15:35,941 --> 00:15:38,908
Look, I-I get it,
this is still my room;

341
00:15:38,909 --> 00:15:40,610
we haven't really
made it yours.

342
00:15:40,611 --> 00:15:41,844
Thank you.

343
00:15:41,845 --> 00:15:43,580
Which is why I got you

344
00:15:43,581 --> 00:15:46,381
this Pink Power Ranger.

345
00:15:47,351 --> 00:15:49,251
Put it anywhere you like.

346
00:15:49,254 --> 00:15:52,554
Okay, but you may feel
some discomfort.

347
00:15:53,658 --> 00:15:56,359
I'm kidding,
I want you to feel at home here.

348
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:58,528
Decorate it any way
that makes you happy.

349
00:15:58,529 --> 00:16:00,028
Do you really mean that?

350
00:16:00,030 --> 00:16:00,996
I really do.

351
00:16:00,999 --> 00:16:02,432
Great, and just so you know,

352
00:16:02,433 --> 00:16:04,033
I'm not getting rid
of all your stuff.

353
00:16:04,034 --> 00:16:05,368
Yeah? What are you keeping?

354
00:16:05,370 --> 00:16:06,936
That candle

355
00:16:06,937 --> 00:16:08,403
and you.

356
00:16:10,075 --> 00:16:11,506
What about my robot poster?

357
00:16:11,509 --> 00:16:12,475
Buh, buh, buh, buh, buh.

358
00:16:12,476 --> 00:16:14,543
I can make do
with just the candle.

359
00:16:21,152 --> 00:16:23,519
What's going on?

360
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:26,688
I'm struggling with the thought
of leaving my old bedroom.

361
00:16:27,792 --> 00:16:30,393
Can it be more
of an internal struggle?

362
00:16:32,096 --> 00:16:33,363
I need to see it.

363
00:16:34,832 --> 00:16:36,365
While I'm gone,

364
00:16:36,368 --> 00:16:39,067
don't breathe on my pillow.

365
00:16:39,070 --> 00:16:41,004
How about if I just don't
breathe at all?

366
00:16:41,005 --> 00:16:43,038
That's my girl.

367
00:16:49,246 --> 00:16:51,847
What on earth?

368
00:17:05,729 --> 00:17:07,562
What is going on?

369
00:17:07,564 --> 00:17:09,232
Oh, hey, Sheldon.

370
00:17:10,068 --> 00:17:11,167
We turned your room

371
00:17:11,168 --> 00:17:12,635
into a sex dungeon.

372
00:17:12,637 --> 00:17:15,204
Oh!

373
00:17:16,073 --> 00:17:17,139
No!

374
00:17:17,141 --> 00:17:18,707
What is happening?

375
00:17:22,347 --> 00:17:24,246
Okay, last question.

376
00:17:24,248 --> 00:17:26,748
The chaps he was wearing...
assless?

377
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:31,320
Can we just focus on
the decision I'm facing?

378
00:17:31,321 --> 00:17:33,055
We can, but for the record,

379
00:17:33,058 --> 00:17:35,591
all chaps are assless.

380
00:17:35,592 --> 00:17:38,226
Gentlemen, please,

381
00:17:38,228 --> 00:17:40,096
this is a
significant decision.

382
00:17:40,098 --> 00:17:43,166
Now, do Amy and I
continue living together?

383
00:17:43,168 --> 00:17:45,368
Or do I move back in
with Leonard?

384
00:17:45,370 --> 00:17:47,637
Over my assless chaps you will.

385
00:17:48,639 --> 00:17:51,073
This isn't complicated.

386
00:17:51,609 --> 00:17:52,641
Do you love Amy?

387
00:17:52,643 --> 00:17:53,676
Yes.

388
00:17:53,677 --> 00:17:55,177
Do you like living with her?

389
00:17:55,179 --> 00:17:56,245
Yes.

390
00:17:56,246 --> 00:17:58,648
Do you know what
you need to do now?

391
00:17:59,516 --> 00:18:01,083
Apparently,
figure this out on my own

392
00:18:01,085 --> 00:18:02,819
'cause you guys
are no help at all.

393
00:18:22,005 --> 00:18:24,173
Hi.

394
00:18:24,175 --> 00:18:25,475
Hello.

395
00:18:25,476 --> 00:18:27,342
What are you doing?

396
00:18:28,646 --> 00:18:32,281
I'm just contemplating
Buridan's donkey.

397
00:18:32,283 --> 00:18:33,549
I understand.

398
00:18:33,551 --> 00:18:34,716
I'll leave you be.

399
00:18:37,455 --> 00:18:39,789
What, you're familiar
with the reference?

400
00:18:39,791 --> 00:18:41,090
Of course.

401
00:18:41,091 --> 00:18:43,059
Jean Buridan proposed

402
00:18:43,061 --> 00:18:44,593
a philosophical thesis
stating that

403
00:18:44,596 --> 00:18:46,995
a hungry donkey placed
between two equidistant

404
00:18:46,997 --> 00:18:49,665
bales of hay would be
paralyzed by indecision

405
00:18:49,667 --> 00:18:51,234
and would starve to death.

406
00:18:55,939 --> 00:18:57,639
Exactly.

407
00:18:58,810 --> 00:19:01,377
Well, I wouldn't want you
to starve to death, so...

408
00:19:02,347 --> 00:19:04,714
here's an eggplant.

409
00:19:06,551 --> 00:19:07,917
Thank you.

410
00:19:08,986 --> 00:19:11,486
You know, some people
believe that Buridan

411
00:19:11,488 --> 00:19:13,089
was plagiarizing Aristotle.

412
00:19:13,091 --> 00:19:14,623
Really?

413
00:19:14,626 --> 00:19:15,658
Although,

414
00:19:15,659 --> 00:19:16,926
in Aristotle's example,

415
00:19:16,927 --> 00:19:19,762
he proposed an equally
hungry and thirsty man

416
00:19:19,764 --> 00:19:21,196
caught between food and drink.

417
00:19:21,198 --> 00:19:22,931
Huh.

418
00:19:22,934 --> 00:19:24,199
Yeah, I wonder if that's related

419
00:19:24,202 --> 00:19:26,535
to the 12th century
Persian philosopher,

420
00:19:26,537 --> 00:19:27,436
Al-Ghazali

421
00:19:27,437 --> 00:19:29,004
and his story of a man

422
00:19:29,006 --> 00:19:30,706
caught between two dates.

423
00:19:30,707 --> 00:19:33,609
Are you suggesting Al-Ghazali
was Aristotelian?

424
00:19:33,610 --> 00:19:36,745
'Cause if anything,
he was anti-Aristotelian.

425
00:19:38,015 --> 00:19:41,317
Al-Ghazali was
anti-Aristotelian?

426
00:19:41,319 --> 00:19:43,186
Boy, you think you know a guy.

427
00:19:52,859 --> 00:19:54,158
Okay.

428
00:19:54,159 --> 00:19:57,094
Open your eyes and
see your new room.

429
00:20:01,133 --> 00:20:03,333
Wow.

430
00:20:04,337 --> 00:20:05,870
I-I know I went
a little overboard.

431
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:07,104
We can always
dial it back.

432
00:20:07,107 --> 00:20:08,238
No, no, no, no, no,

433
00:20:08,241 --> 00:20:09,139
it's-it's important to me

434
00:20:09,141 --> 00:20:10,875
that you have
the bedroom you want.

435
00:20:10,877 --> 00:20:12,677
Oh, that means so
much. I love you.

436
00:20:12,678 --> 00:20:14,245
I love you, too.

437
00:20:17,383 --> 00:20:19,850
Just hiding some stuff in
your closet, don't tell Penny.
