1
00:00:05,353 --> 00:00:06,936
All right, we're
about to go live.

2
00:00:06,938 --> 00:00:08,271
Everyone on
their A-game!

3
00:00:08,273 --> 00:00:10,206
Good energy!

4
00:00:10,208 --> 00:00:11,924
Hello.

5
00:00:13,728 --> 00:00:15,728
I'm Dr. Sheldon Cooper.

6
00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:17,730
And I'm
Dr. Amy Farrah Fowler.

7
00:00:17,732 --> 00:00:19,599
And welcome to a
special retrospective,

8
00:00:19,601 --> 00:00:21,567
where we will take a
look back at the history

9
00:00:21,569 --> 00:00:25,204
of Fun with Flags on an
episode we're calling...

10
00:00:25,206 --> 00:00:27,924
"Fun with Flags:
Behind the Flags:

11
00:00:27,926 --> 00:00:31,294
A Retrospective."

Mind you, when we say
"behind the flags"

21
00:00:57,655 --> 00:00:59,989
we don't literally
mean these flags.

22
00:00:59,991 --> 00:01:03,025
That's just where
we have dinner.

23
00:01:03,027 --> 00:01:05,328
Now, I'm sure many of you
are wondering

24
00:01:05,330 --> 00:01:07,663
how Fun with Flags began.

25
00:01:07,665 --> 00:01:09,799
So let's hear from some
people who were there

26
00:01:09,801 --> 00:01:11,317
at the very start.

27
00:01:11,319 --> 00:01:13,419
H-Howard.
Flashback sounds.

28
00:01:17,725 --> 00:01:19,008
Could have played
that on my harp.

29
00:01:19,010 --> 00:01:21,410
Just roll the clip.

30
00:01:21,412 --> 00:01:23,596
So tell us in your own words

31
00:01:23,598 --> 00:01:27,016
about that magical moment
when Fun with Flags was born.

32
00:01:27,018 --> 00:01:28,901
I honestly
don't remember.

33
00:01:30,688 --> 00:01:32,021
Sure you do.

34
00:01:32,023 --> 00:01:33,656
I was telling you both
the story

35
00:01:33,658 --> 00:01:35,358
about how Haiti
and Lichtenstein

36
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:37,159
discovered they had
the same flag.

37
00:01:37,161 --> 00:01:39,695
It was at
the Summer Olympics of 1936,

38
00:01:39,697 --> 00:01:41,030
and two plucky nations...

39
00:01:41,032 --> 00:01:42,365
Oh, wait. I remember.

40
00:01:42,367 --> 00:01:44,250
Oh, and do you remember
what you said?

41
00:01:44,252 --> 00:01:47,336
Yes. "Please find
someone who cares"

42
00:01:48,873 --> 00:01:52,174
And that's exactly what I did.

43
00:01:52,176 --> 00:01:55,511
I found a lot
of someones.

44
00:01:55,513 --> 00:01:58,347
Almost 200.

45
00:01:58,349 --> 00:02:01,517
Many of them on purpose.

46
00:02:01,519 --> 00:02:04,553
And now we're going to turn
it over to you, the viewers,

47
00:02:04,555 --> 00:02:06,188
to call in and share

48
00:02:06,190 --> 00:02:08,441
your favorite
Fun with Flags moments.

49
00:02:08,443 --> 00:02:11,227
And-and don't get discouraged
if the phone lines are jammed.

50
00:02:11,229 --> 00:02:13,396
Just keep trying.

51
00:02:34,552 --> 00:02:35,751
Oh, thank God!

52
00:02:35,753 --> 00:02:37,470
Welcome to Fun with Flags!

53
00:02:37,472 --> 00:02:38,804
Hey, Sheldon.

54
00:02:38,806 --> 00:02:40,740
Hey, Amy. It's Bert.

55
00:02:40,742 --> 00:02:42,174
Hello, Bert.

56
00:02:42,176 --> 00:02:45,061
What is your flag-related
comment or query?

57
00:02:45,063 --> 00:02:47,380
I have a girlfriend.

58
00:02:49,217 --> 00:02:52,018
And what does that
have to do with flags?

59
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:55,705
Nothing. I just wanted everyone
to know I have a girlfriend.

60
00:02:55,707 --> 00:02:57,940
Bert, you're
tying up the line.

61
00:02:57,942 --> 00:02:59,992
My apologies
to all of you

62
00:02:59,994 --> 00:03:02,578

legitimate flag comments.

63
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:03,946
Ooh, ooh. All right.

76
00:03:35,606 --> 00:03:38,908
Should we get lunch or
you want to eat at the zoo?

77
00:03:40,611 --> 00:03:42,611
"Oh, Howie, I don't need food

78
00:03:42,613 --> 00:03:46,132
as long as I can
look at my phone".

79
00:03:46,134 --> 00:03:48,451
I don't like
when you imitate me.

80
00:03:48,453 --> 00:03:50,119
You want to hear my Stuart?

81
00:03:50,121 --> 00:03:53,789
"It's been a
while since I've gone on a date.

82
00:03:53,791 --> 00:03:57,677
You mind if we watch
the monkeys doing it?"

83
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:04,967
I said that to you
in confidence.

84
00:04:06,471 --> 00:04:08,721
This is supposed to be
our family fun day.

85
00:04:08,723 --> 00:04:10,473
What's so important
on your phone?

86
00:04:10,475 --> 00:04:12,808
I'm on the day care's
Web site.

87
00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:15,061
Stop looking at that.
The day care's great.

88
00:04:15,063 --> 00:04:16,312
It's on campus.

89
00:04:16,314 --> 00:04:17,646
My office is
two minutes away.

90
00:04:17,648 --> 00:04:19,098
There's nothing
to worry about.

91
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:22,201
What if she likes the people
who work there more than us?

92
00:04:22,203 --> 00:04:25,287
She already likes soap bubbles
more than us.

93
00:04:25,289 --> 00:04:27,156
When I go back to work,

94
00:04:27,158 --> 00:04:28,824
we're gonna leave her
with these people.

95
00:04:28,826 --> 00:04:30,459
We don't know anything
about them.

96
00:04:30,461 --> 00:04:34,246
They're highly-trained educators
with background checks.

97
00:04:34,248 --> 00:04:37,717
They're even required to be
current on all vaccinations.

98
00:04:38,853 --> 00:04:41,170
You leave her with me,
and I'm not any of those things.

99
00:04:44,675 --> 00:04:46,008
Where's Howard?

100
00:04:46,010 --> 00:04:48,177
He took the day off.

101
00:04:48,179 --> 00:04:50,513
Oh, let's take advantage
of his absence

102
00:04:50,515 --> 00:04:52,848
and tell the kinds of jokes
only physicists get.

103
00:04:52,850 --> 00:04:54,900
I'll go first.

104
00:04:54,902 --> 00:04:58,487
Okay, here. Uh, Heisenberg is
pulled over by a police officer.

105
00:04:58,489 --> 00:04:59,989
And the policeman says,

106
00:04:59,991 --> 00:05:02,408
"Did you know you were going
85 miles per hour?"

107
00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:03,993
And Heisenberg says,

108
00:05:03,995 --> 00:05:06,695
"Darn it, now I don't know
where I am."

109
00:05:09,033 --> 00:05:10,866
- So Howard back Monday?
- Yeah.

110
00:05:12,703 --> 00:05:13,702
Hey, guys.

111
00:05:13,704 --> 00:05:15,538
Oh, hello.
Hey. Want to join us?

112
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:18,791
But he's a geologist,
and I have more physics jokes.

113
00:05:18,793 --> 00:05:20,376
Oh, quick! Sit!

114
00:05:21,896 --> 00:05:24,930
So, Sheldon says
you have a new girlfriend.

115
00:05:24,932 --> 00:05:27,349
Yeah, which he rudely
announced on my flag show.

116
00:05:27,351 --> 00:05:29,018
People were so
upset about it

117
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:32,221
no one else called in
the rest of the night.

118
00:05:32,223 --> 00:05:34,523
Sorry. I couldn't help myself.

119
00:05:34,525 --> 00:05:36,725
I guess I just love love.

120
00:05:36,727 --> 00:05:38,778
Well, I'm very
happy for you.

121
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:40,563
Hey, we're all having
dinner tonight.

122
00:05:40,565 --> 00:05:41,897
Why don't the two
of you join us?

123
00:05:41,899 --> 00:05:43,232
Yeah, wh... Hold on.

124
00:05:43,234 --> 00:05:45,367
We don't know anything
about this woman.

125
00:05:45,369 --> 00:05:46,569
What do you want to know?

126
00:05:46,571 --> 00:05:48,320
Is she a geologist?

127
00:05:48,322 --> 00:05:50,573
No.
Oh, great. See you at 7:00.

128
00:05:58,249 --> 00:06:00,949
How about after this
we go see the exotic bird show?

129
00:06:00,951 --> 00:06:02,067
Not a good idea.

130
00:06:02,069 --> 00:06:06,205
My hair is a coveted
nesting material.

131
00:06:08,459 --> 00:06:10,459
Learning anything?

132
00:06:10,461 --> 00:06:12,961
Well, sloth babies cling
to their mothers' bodies

133
00:06:12,963 --> 00:06:14,463
for almost a year.

134
00:06:14,465 --> 00:06:16,465
I'm going back to work
after only four months,

135
00:06:16,467 --> 00:06:18,467
so I've learned I hate
myself, I hate sloths,

136
00:06:18,469 --> 00:06:21,653
and I hate you for
bringing me here.

137
00:06:21,655 --> 00:06:26,141
Me I get, but that sloth
is pretty cute.

138
00:06:27,328 --> 00:06:29,495
It's not just the sloth.

139
00:06:29,497 --> 00:06:32,398
Polar bears nurse their cubs
for almost eight months.

140
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:35,401
The orangutan mother builds her
baby a new home every night.

141
00:06:35,403 --> 00:06:38,570
And what do I do? I choose
my career over my child!

142
00:06:41,442 --> 00:06:44,660
Told you we should
have gone to Legoland.

143
00:06:47,064 --> 00:06:50,099
Can't believe Bert has
a girlfriend and I don't.

144
00:06:50,101 --> 00:06:51,967
I thought you were
taking a break from women

145
00:06:51,969 --> 00:06:53,218
to focus on your career.

146
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:54,636
Oh, grow up.

147
00:06:57,808 --> 00:07:00,175
Don't you have
any friends he can date?

148
00:07:00,177 --> 00:07:02,177
Hey, I already set up
Howard and Bernadette.

149
00:07:02,179 --> 00:07:05,597
It's your turn to ruin
some poor girl's life.

150
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:07,182
Oh, hey, guys. Come in.

151
00:07:07,184 --> 00:07:08,417
Thanks.

152
00:07:08,419 --> 00:07:09,685
Everyone,

153
00:07:09,687 --> 00:07:11,570
this is Rebecca.
Hi.

154
00:07:11,572 --> 00:07:12,905
Hey.

155
00:07:12,907 --> 00:07:16,358
She's younger and far more
attractive than he is.

156
00:07:17,878 --> 00:07:20,996
They're copying you two.

157
00:07:24,034 --> 00:07:25,868
What are you making?

158
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:27,202
Chicken.

159
00:07:27,204 --> 00:07:30,839
Birds mess with my hair,
I come back hard.

160
00:07:35,012 --> 00:07:36,512
Finally get Halley down?

161
00:07:36,514 --> 00:07:37,963
Yeah, eventually.

162
00:07:37,965 --> 00:07:39,882
She's still not happy about
taking a bottle, though.

163
00:07:39,884 --> 00:07:42,117
Look, if you're not
ready to go back to work,

164
00:07:42,119 --> 00:07:43,602
we'll figure
something out.

165
00:07:43,604 --> 00:07:44,853
No, I'll be fine.

166
00:07:44,855 --> 00:07:46,889
It might be
good for her.

167
00:07:46,891 --> 00:07:48,891
Howard's mother was around him
all the time,

168
00:07:48,893 --> 00:07:52,611
and he's a world-class
mama's boy.

169
00:07:53,731 --> 00:07:55,647
I mean, wh-why
would you say that?

170
00:07:55,649 --> 00:07:58,734
Go ahead, have a tantrum;
that'll prove me wrong.

171
00:08:01,322 --> 00:08:04,039
It would be nice to raise Halley
to be a little more independent

172
00:08:04,041 --> 00:08:05,240
than you were.

173
00:08:05,242 --> 00:08:06,825
I guess.

174
00:08:06,827 --> 00:08:08,994
It wasn't until college
that I learned

175
00:08:08,996 --> 00:08:11,880
you can put a thermometer
in your mouth.

176
00:08:15,453 --> 00:08:19,087
On that charming note,
dinner is served.

177
00:08:22,209 --> 00:08:24,676
So is this your first time
dating a scientist?

178
00:08:24,678 --> 00:08:27,062
'Cause I'm thinking of starting
a support group.

179
00:08:28,315 --> 00:08:29,848
Actually, I'm not new to this.

180
00:08:29,850 --> 00:08:32,234
I was engaged
to a Scientologist.

181
00:08:36,774 --> 00:08:39,525
Bert, Rebecca.

182
00:08:39,527 --> 00:08:42,528
I'd like to apologize for my
insensitive comment earlier.

183
00:08:42,530 --> 00:08:44,446
Don't worry about it.
It's fine.

184
00:08:44,448 --> 00:08:45,914
See? It was fine.

185
00:08:45,916 --> 00:08:47,833
I didn't need a time-out.

186
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:52,204
It wasn't a time-out.
Let's get some food.

187
00:08:52,206 --> 00:08:54,623
You made me sit on the stairs
and think about what I did.

188
00:08:54,625 --> 00:08:56,041
Get your food!

189
00:08:57,928 --> 00:09:01,663
So how did you two meet?

190
00:09:01,665 --> 00:09:03,131
Oh, it's such
a cute story.

191
00:09:03,133 --> 00:09:05,767
We met on
a dating Web site.

192
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:11,540
Is that it?

193
00:09:11,542 --> 00:09:14,643
Oh, sorry. The end.

194
00:09:16,564 --> 00:09:17,813
That's nice.

195
00:09:17,815 --> 00:09:20,315
I haven't had much success
meeting people online.

196
00:09:20,317 --> 00:09:23,402
I didn't either, until
I revamped my profile.

197
00:09:23,404 --> 00:09:25,988
What'd you do,
delete your photo?

198
00:09:29,810 --> 00:09:32,494
Go.
Fine.

199
00:09:35,266 --> 00:09:37,165
And don't you slam that door.

200
00:09:37,167 --> 00:09:38,884
Aw, man.

201
00:09:40,754 --> 00:09:42,671
Did I say something wrong?

202
00:09:42,673 --> 00:09:44,506
No, it's always him.

203
00:09:45,726 --> 00:09:49,561
So, Bert, you were telling us
how you updated your profile?

204
00:09:49,563 --> 00:09:52,648
Right. I wasn't getting any
responses, and then I added,

205
00:09:52,650 --> 00:09:55,767
"Recent $625,000
MacArthur grant winner",

206
00:09:55,769 --> 00:09:57,269
and five minutes later,

207
00:09:57,271 --> 00:09:59,655
I met my soul mate.

208
00:10:04,194 --> 00:10:06,695
I was wrong.
You can come back in.

209
00:10:11,928 --> 00:10:14,679
So, Rebecca, how did you become
a personal trainer?

210
00:10:14,681 --> 00:10:17,081
I came to Los Angeles
to be an actress,

211
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:18,733
and things
didn't really work out.

212
00:10:18,735 --> 00:10:21,686
I'd say she's copying you
again, but...

213
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:26,658
I'm getting tired
of sitting in the hall.

214
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:28,610
I'd love a personal trainer.

215
00:10:28,612 --> 00:10:30,995
I haven't seen my abs
since they opened a Shake Shack

216
00:10:30,997 --> 00:10:33,031
on my drive home.

217
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,783
I could give you
some free sessions.

218
00:10:35,785 --> 00:10:37,285
Oh, is that offer
for everybody?

219
00:10:37,287 --> 00:10:38,503
Nice try.

220
00:10:38,505 --> 00:10:40,672
I'm not going.

221
00:10:42,676 --> 00:10:44,292
Where's your bathroom?

222
00:10:44,294 --> 00:10:47,245
Mm, just down there.

223
00:10:47,247 --> 00:10:49,631
She's so perfect, sometimes
I think she isn't real.

224
00:10:49,633 --> 00:10:52,934
And then she goes to
the bathroom, and I know she is.

225
00:10:54,804 --> 00:10:57,438
Aw, that's so weird.

226
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,340
I'm sorry, Bert,

227
00:10:59,342 --> 00:11:02,060
but aren't you worried she's
only with you for your money?

228
00:11:02,062 --> 00:11:03,695
She better be.
On our first date,

229
00:11:03,697 --> 00:11:06,447
I bought her
an 80-inch flat-screen.

230
00:11:07,984 --> 00:11:09,234
Your first date?

231
00:11:09,236 --> 00:11:11,536
Did you even
measure her walls?

232
00:11:17,494 --> 00:11:18,660
You know, on
our first date,

233
00:11:18,662 --> 00:11:22,163
Leonard used a coupon
to buy me a pretzel.

234
00:11:22,165 --> 00:11:25,833
And we lived
happily ever after.

235
00:11:25,835 --> 00:11:28,002
The end.

236
00:11:30,307 --> 00:11:32,840
Well, guess
I'm ready to go.

237
00:11:32,842 --> 00:11:34,392
Have a great first day back.

238
00:11:34,394 --> 00:11:36,311
You have everything
she needs for day care?

239
00:11:36,313 --> 00:11:37,845
Yep, all in the bag.

240
00:11:37,847 --> 00:11:39,013
Good.

241
00:11:39,015 --> 00:11:40,348
Okay, sweetie,

242
00:11:40,350 --> 00:11:43,017
Mommy's gonna go to work now,
so you have fun today.

243
00:11:43,019 --> 00:11:44,819
I told her if day care
is anything like prison,

244
00:11:44,821 --> 00:11:47,589
find the biggest baby
and knock him out.

245
00:11:47,591 --> 00:11:50,491
Bye, cutie.

246
00:11:50,493 --> 00:11:52,694
I'm gonna miss you.

247
00:11:52,696 --> 00:11:55,530
I'm gonna be
waiting right here tonight

248
00:11:55,532 --> 00:11:57,365
when you get home.

249
00:11:59,202 --> 00:12:01,953
Stop, you're gonna
make me cry.

250
00:12:01,955 --> 00:12:04,539
Great, now everybody's crying.

251
00:12:05,792 --> 00:12:07,208
At least Halley's not.

252
00:12:07,210 --> 00:12:08,626
That's good.

253
00:12:08,628 --> 00:12:11,679
She's not gonna see us all day,
and she doesn't even care!

254
00:12:14,718 --> 00:12:16,884
Who's ready to laugh?

255
00:12:16,886 --> 00:12:18,436
Okay. So...

256
00:12:18,438 --> 00:12:21,973
Feynman, Einstein
and Schrodinger walk into a bar.

257
00:12:21,975 --> 00:12:23,524
Feynman says,

258
00:12:23,526 --> 00:12:25,727
"It appears
we're inside a joke."

259
00:12:25,729 --> 00:12:28,446
Einstein replies,
"But only to an observer

260
00:12:28,448 --> 00:12:30,431
who saw us walk in
simultaneously."

261
00:12:30,433 --> 00:12:32,150
To which
Schrodinger says,

262
00:12:32,152 --> 00:12:35,403
"If someone's looking
in the window, I'm leaving."

263
00:12:37,574 --> 00:12:40,658
That's
actually funny.

264
00:12:42,462 --> 00:12:45,413
You should send that
to Jimmy Fallon.

265
00:12:46,583 --> 00:12:47,665
Hey.

266
00:12:47,667 --> 00:12:49,584
Oh, hello. Join us.
Hey. Yeah.

267
00:12:49,586 --> 00:12:52,253
Hey, sorry if last night
was awkward.

268
00:12:52,255 --> 00:12:53,638
Actually, it got me thinking

269
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:56,090
that I shouldn't flaunt my money
to find love.

270
00:12:56,092 --> 00:12:57,942
I might break up with Rebecca.

271
00:12:57,944 --> 00:12:59,761
Wow, that's a big step.

272
00:12:59,763 --> 00:13:01,729
I think it shows
a lot of character.

273
00:13:01,731 --> 00:13:03,848
I'm gonna hold out
and see if I can find

274
00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:06,100
a hot young blonde
who likes me for me.

275
00:13:06,102 --> 00:13:08,603
That's a good one.

276
00:13:12,192 --> 00:13:14,442
Okay, now, Leonard,
you tell a joke.

277
00:13:18,498 --> 00:13:20,114
How's she doing?

278
00:13:20,116 --> 00:13:22,083
She's great. Look.

279
00:13:22,085 --> 00:13:24,419
I see a wall...

280
00:13:24,421 --> 00:13:25,787
floor...

281
00:13:25,789 --> 00:13:27,789
some Asian baby...

282
00:13:27,791 --> 00:13:29,457
There she is.

283
00:13:29,459 --> 00:13:31,676
See? Nothing to worry about.

284
00:13:31,678 --> 00:13:33,211
Thank you.

285
00:13:33,213 --> 00:13:34,846
Okay, I'm gonna try
and get some work done.

286
00:13:34,848 --> 00:13:36,881
Yeah, me, too. Love you.

287
00:13:36,883 --> 00:13:38,766
Love you, too. Bye.

288
00:13:45,859 --> 00:13:47,608
How is she?

289
00:13:51,898 --> 00:13:53,364
What are you doing here?

290
00:13:53,366 --> 00:13:55,950
Can't a guy hang out
at a college he doesn't go to

291
00:13:55,952 --> 00:13:58,202
and stare at a baby
that isn't his?

292
00:13:58,204 --> 00:14:01,038
I get it.

293
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:04,242
I haven't even made
it to my office yet.

294
00:14:09,916 --> 00:14:13,384
Is it weird if we just stand
here and watch her all day?

295
00:14:13,386 --> 00:14:15,586
Probably.

296
00:14:17,841 --> 00:14:19,474
We should go.

297
00:14:19,476 --> 00:14:20,558
Yeah.

298
00:14:22,846 --> 00:14:25,346
Or we could take her
to the aquarium.

299
00:14:25,348 --> 00:14:27,482
I'll get her,
you grab her bag.

300
00:14:27,484 --> 00:14:31,152
Hang on, Halley,
we're busting you out of there!

301
00:14:33,356 --> 00:14:35,773
What are you looking at?

302
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:37,909
Comments from our Behind
the Flags retrospective.

303
00:14:37,911 --> 00:14:39,610
Get this, people
are calling it

304
00:14:39,612 --> 00:14:42,947
"the longest one yet"

305
00:14:44,384 --> 00:14:46,267
Hello? Anybody home?

306
00:14:46,269 --> 00:14:47,335
Is that Bert?

307
00:14:47,337 --> 00:14:48,402
It's Bert.

308
00:14:48,404 --> 00:14:50,872
I think it's Bert.

309
00:14:51,758 --> 00:14:53,708
Hey, what's up?

310
00:14:53,710 --> 00:14:55,510
I broke up with Rebecca.

311
00:14:55,512 --> 00:14:56,844
- Oh.
- Oh.

312
00:14:56,846 --> 00:14:58,429
You know, good for you.

313
00:14:58,431 --> 00:15:00,631
No, I miss her.

314
00:15:00,633 --> 00:15:02,667
I don't know why
I listened to you.

315
00:15:02,669 --> 00:15:04,886
He's not wrong.

316
00:15:06,606 --> 00:15:09,857
It was your crackpot idea
that he deserves love.

317
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:13,194
You know, you need to start
raising your hand

318
00:15:13,196 --> 00:15:14,362
before you speak.

319
00:15:16,583 --> 00:15:18,399
Yes, starting now.

320
00:15:20,153 --> 00:15:21,736
Bert, you're a good guy;
you deserve a woman

321
00:15:21,738 --> 00:15:23,738
who's interested in
more than just your money.

322
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:25,740
She was also interested
in walking around my house

323
00:15:25,742 --> 00:15:26,874
in her underwear.

324
00:15:26,876 --> 00:15:30,228
Now the only one
doing that is me.

325
00:15:32,131 --> 00:15:35,416
If you're that upset,
go get her back.

326
00:15:35,418 --> 00:15:36,467
I tried.

327
00:15:36,469 --> 00:15:38,252
She's not answering my calls.

328
00:15:38,254 --> 00:15:41,672
Which really hurts
because I bought her that phone.

329
00:15:43,092 --> 00:15:45,309
I made a huge mistake.

330
00:15:45,311 --> 00:15:46,727
No, you didn't.

331
00:15:46,729 --> 00:15:49,063
Okay? Look, Bert,
when I had money,

332
00:15:49,065 --> 00:15:51,432
I dated lots of girls
who weren't right for me.

333
00:15:51,434 --> 00:15:52,984
And then I gave
up my money,

334
00:15:52,986 --> 00:15:55,102
and now I'm alone and
living with my friends,

335
00:15:55,104 --> 00:15:58,756
and somebody else should
probably talk now.

336
00:16:00,343 --> 00:16:02,109
Look, sweetie,

337
00:16:02,111 --> 00:16:03,828
relationships
aren't about money, okay?

338
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:05,913
It's about respect
and having things in common

339
00:16:05,915 --> 00:16:07,465
and...

340
00:16:07,467 --> 00:16:08,950
Yes, Sheldon?

341
00:16:08,952 --> 00:16:10,785
You and Leonard
don't have anything in common.

342
00:16:10,787 --> 00:16:12,870
Maybe you should break up.

343
00:16:14,424 --> 00:16:16,257
You called on him.

344
00:16:20,496 --> 00:16:22,964
Guess who's home from day care?

345
00:16:24,634 --> 00:16:26,717
It's Halley.

346
00:16:26,719 --> 00:16:27,935
Unless somebody else put an "X"

347
00:16:27,937 --> 00:16:30,638
on the bottom
of their kid's foot.

348
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:33,307
You realize they called
when you took her.

349
00:16:35,979 --> 00:16:39,814
Guess who's
home from the aquarium?

350
00:16:42,669 --> 00:16:44,535
Sorry again
for barging in.

351
00:16:44,537 --> 00:16:46,487
You don't have to go.
You're welcome to hang with us.

352
00:16:46,489 --> 00:16:49,490
Actually, our friendship
group is at capacity.

353
00:16:49,492 --> 00:16:53,327
But if anybody drops out,
you're at the top of the list.

354
00:16:54,881 --> 00:16:56,163
Unless it's Raj,

355
00:16:56,165 --> 00:16:59,317
in which case, we'll probably
get a person of color.

356
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:04,221
You guys are nice,
but I'm just gonna

357
00:17:04,223 --> 00:17:08,175
buy Rebecca a Jet Ski
and see if that gets her back.

358
00:17:08,177 --> 00:17:11,312
I feel bad for Bert.

359
00:17:11,314 --> 00:17:13,731
So he's using his money
to attract a mate.

360
00:17:13,733 --> 00:17:15,850
Is that any different
than me using my intelligence

361
00:17:15,852 --> 00:17:17,068
to attract Amy?

362
00:17:17,070 --> 00:17:20,354
Or Leonard using his power
of groveling to get Penny?

363
00:17:21,858 --> 00:17:23,074
It's totally different.

364
00:17:23,076 --> 00:17:24,325
Bert's money might run out,

365
00:17:24,327 --> 00:17:26,861
but I can beg
until the end of time.

366
00:17:28,615 --> 00:17:32,199
All that
and he's shorter than me.

367
00:17:34,504 --> 00:17:38,205
Sheldon, what did Amy have
that attracted you?

368
00:17:38,207 --> 00:17:40,057
Oh, so many things.

369
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:42,627
Her mind, her kindness,

370
00:17:42,629 --> 00:17:45,463
and especially her body.

371
00:17:45,465 --> 00:17:46,547
Really?

372
00:17:46,549 --> 00:17:48,582
Relax.
We're the same blood type.

373
00:17:48,584 --> 00:17:51,719
He knew he could
harvest an organ.

374
00:18:00,598 --> 00:18:02,348
She does look happy.

375
00:18:02,350 --> 00:18:04,884
See? This is
the right thing for her.

376
00:18:04,886 --> 00:18:07,153
Let's all just
go to work.

377
00:18:12,977 --> 00:18:15,027
Anytime.

378
00:18:15,029 --> 00:18:18,414
Let me just say good-bye.

379
00:18:19,284 --> 00:18:22,251
Halley. Look at Mommy.

380
00:18:23,088 --> 00:18:24,954
Over here, honey.

381
00:18:26,958 --> 00:18:28,708
Say good-bye to Mommy!

382
00:18:29,594 --> 00:18:31,043
Look at me!

383
00:18:31,045 --> 00:18:33,096
Look at your mother!

384
00:18:36,184 --> 00:18:38,301
All right, we can go.

385
00:18:41,556 --> 00:18:42,905
Hello.

386
00:18:42,907 --> 00:18:44,474
I'm Dr. Sheldon Cooper.

387
00:18:44,476 --> 00:18:46,409
And I'm
Dr. Amy Farrah Fowler.

388
00:18:46,411 --> 00:18:47,977
Based on the
glowing reception

389
00:18:47,979 --> 00:18:50,513
of our recent Behind
the Flags retrospective,

390
00:18:50,515 --> 00:18:53,416
we thought you might like to
see how it all came together.

391
00:18:53,418 --> 00:18:56,819
So welcome
to tonight's episode...

392
00:18:56,821 --> 00:18:58,221
Fun with Flags:

393
00:18:58,223 --> 00:19:00,206
Behind the
Behind the Flags:

394
00:19:00,208 --> 00:19:02,375
A Retrospective Retrospective.

395
00:19:04,479 --> 00:19:06,546
Ooh, we already have
our first call.

396
00:19:06,548 --> 00:19:08,080
Oh.

397
00:19:08,082 --> 00:19:10,750
Hello, you're on
Fun with Flags.

398
00:19:10,752 --> 00:19:12,702
The Jet Ski worked.
I got her back.
