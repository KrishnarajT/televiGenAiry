1
00:00:01,021 --> 00:00:01,753
Come on, Raj!

2
00:00:01,755 --> 00:00:02,654
You can do this!

3
00:00:02,656 --> 00:00:03,688
There's no way.

4
00:00:03,690 --> 00:00:04,790
What is happening?

5
00:00:04,792 --> 00:00:05,791
This is an Euler's Disk.

6
00:00:05,793 --> 00:00:06,792
It's a physics toy

7
00:00:06,794 --> 00:00:08,260
that demonstrates
angular momentum,

8
00:00:08,262 --> 00:00:10,429
potential energy,
and kinetic energy.

9
00:00:10,431 --> 00:00:12,597
Aw, look at you
watching sports.

10
00:00:13,467 --> 00:00:14,766
We're betting to see
if Koothrappali

11
00:00:14,768 --> 00:00:15,700
can hold his breath

12
00:00:15,702 --> 00:00:17,135
longer than the
disk can spin.

13
00:00:17,137 --> 00:00:18,637
Its weight and smoothness,

14
00:00:18,639 --> 00:00:21,206
along with the slight concavity
of the mirror, means it can spin

15
00:00:21,208 --> 00:00:22,474
for a long time.

16
00:00:22,476 --> 00:00:23,942
But Raj is from India,
which means

17
00:00:23,944 --> 00:00:26,144
he's no slouch
at holding his breath.

18
00:00:27,281 --> 00:00:29,281
Okay, I want in. Ten bucks says
I'll lose interest

19
00:00:29,283 --> 00:00:32,317
before that thing
stops spinning.

20
00:00:33,487 --> 00:00:35,353
Hey, Sheldon, I found a great
restaurant for date night.

21
00:00:35,355 --> 00:00:36,655
Kind of busy right now.

22
00:00:36,657 --> 00:00:39,191
Oh, an Euler's Disk! Fun!
Yeah, we're seeing

23
00:00:39,193 --> 00:00:41,193
if Raj can hold his
breath longer than it.

24
00:00:41,195 --> 00:00:43,161
Oh. Immature.

25
00:00:44,131 --> 00:00:45,330
How ya doing?

26
00:00:45,332 --> 00:00:46,331
Mm.

27
00:00:46,333 --> 00:00:47,666
He's not gonna make it.

28
00:00:47,668 --> 00:00:49,334
Yes, he is!
You know,

29
00:00:49,336 --> 00:00:52,003
deep-sea divers holding
their breath for several minutes

30
00:00:52,005 --> 00:00:53,939
have shown elevated markers
of a protein

31
00:00:53,941 --> 00:00:55,874
that can signal brain damage.

32
00:00:55,876 --> 00:00:59,010
Yeah, see, what's happening here
signals brain damage.

33
00:01:00,747 --> 00:01:02,314
My God, how long does
this thing spin for?

34
00:01:02,316 --> 00:01:05,450
Ha! You're interested!
You're out ten bucks!

35
00:01:05,452 --> 00:01:07,552
It's slowing down!
Dig deep!

36
00:01:07,554 --> 00:01:10,455
Like when we bet you couldn't
fit into Howard's pants!

37
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:13,992
He's not gonna make it!

38
00:01:13,994 --> 00:01:14,793
Yes, he is!

39
00:01:14,795 --> 00:01:16,094
Come on, Raj!
It's like

40
00:01:16,096 --> 00:01:19,531
your favorite movie!
You're just Waiting to Exhale!

41
00:01:24,104 --> 00:01:26,271
Yeah! I knew you
could do it!

42
00:01:27,307 --> 00:01:29,374
And j.. and just so you know,

43
00:01:29,376 --> 00:01:31,209
my favorite movie...

55
00:02:06,815 --> 00:02:08,782
Hello, Rajesh.
How are things by you?

56
00:02:08,784 --> 00:02:09,883
Good, good.

57
00:02:09,885 --> 00:02:12,052
Uh, listen,
I just wanted to let you know

58
00:02:12,054 --> 00:02:13,553
when you get
my credit card bill,

59
00:02:13,555 --> 00:02:15,455
it might be a little high
this month.

60
00:02:15,457 --> 00:02:17,724
Well, you're a grown man
with a steady job.

61
00:02:17,726 --> 00:02:21,495
Why wouldn't you spend
all your father's money?

62
00:02:21,497 --> 00:02:25,832
Oh, Daddy,
you're so rich and funny.

63
00:02:25,834 --> 00:02:29,002
Yeah. So what else is going on
with your life?

64
00:02:29,004 --> 00:02:32,139
Uh, well, I was dating a woman
at the university,

65
00:02:32,141 --> 00:02:33,507
but we broke up.

66
00:02:33,509 --> 00:02:35,409
I'm sorry to hear that.

67
00:02:35,411 --> 00:02:38,478
I know you are. That's why
you just bought me a new iPad.

68
00:02:39,915 --> 00:02:41,214
And before you start,

69
00:02:41,216 --> 00:02:44,284
I am not interested in
you arranging a marriage for me.

70
00:02:44,286 --> 00:02:46,686
Oh, I gave up on that
a long time ago.

71
00:02:46,688 --> 00:02:47,754
You did?

72
00:02:47,756 --> 00:02:49,122
It's too much work.

73
00:02:49,124 --> 00:02:50,557
You're an adult who can't get by

74
00:02:50,559 --> 00:02:52,626
without an allowance
from his parents.

75
00:02:52,628 --> 00:02:54,294
Women don't want that.

76
00:02:54,296 --> 00:02:57,464
Wh-What are you saying,
that y-you're giving up on me?

77
00:02:57,466 --> 00:02:59,733
What kind of father gives up
on his son?

78
00:02:59,735 --> 00:03:01,034
I have six children,

79
00:03:01,036 --> 00:03:03,336
five of whom are married
and self-sufficient.

80
00:03:03,338 --> 00:03:06,773
I don't think I'm the problem.

81
00:03:07,643 --> 00:03:09,309
I can't believe
what I'm hearing.

82
00:03:09,311 --> 00:03:11,745
This is deeply hurtful.

83
00:03:11,747 --> 00:03:12,813
You're also too sensitive.

84
00:03:12,815 --> 00:03:15,582
Women don't want that either.

85
00:03:18,987 --> 00:03:20,720
The food here's
supposed to be great.

86
00:03:20,722 --> 00:03:22,088
Don't fill up
on chips.

87
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:23,824
Oh, I won't.
I have a trick.

88
00:03:23,826 --> 00:03:26,426
I only eat
equilateral triangles.

89
00:03:27,629 --> 00:03:30,330
Isosceles, isosceles,

90
00:03:30,332 --> 00:03:32,933
oh, scalene...

91
00:03:33,769 --> 00:03:35,969
You didn't see that.

92
00:03:37,172 --> 00:03:38,905
Oh, look.

93
00:03:38,907 --> 00:03:40,273
It's Bert, at the bar.

94
00:03:40,275 --> 00:03:41,775
We should
go say hi.

95
00:03:41,777 --> 00:03:44,244
Why?

96
00:03:44,246 --> 00:03:46,179
Because that's what you do

97
00:03:46,181 --> 00:03:49,082
when you see someone you know
in a public place.

98
00:03:49,084 --> 00:03:53,253
I have multiple restraining
orders that say otherwise.

99
00:03:54,923 --> 00:03:57,691
Sheldon, there's a difference
between greeting a friend

100
00:03:57,693 --> 00:04:00,060
and following a celebrity
into a bathroom.

101
00:04:01,263 --> 00:04:03,063
If the judge
couldn't explain it to me,

102
00:04:03,065 --> 00:04:05,265
I don't see how you will.

103
00:04:07,302 --> 00:04:09,002
Hi, Bert.
Hello.

104
00:04:09,004 --> 00:04:10,470
Oh, hey, guys.

105
00:04:10,472 --> 00:04:11,538
What brings you here?

106
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:13,573
Oh, we're having date night.
Nice.

107
00:04:13,575 --> 00:04:14,975
I'm meeting someone, too.

108
00:04:14,977 --> 00:04:16,510
Oh, really. Anybody we know?

109
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:19,546
I doubt it. I met
her on G-Harmony.

110
00:04:19,548 --> 00:04:23,216
That's a Web site for
geologists to find love.

111
00:04:23,218 --> 00:04:24,951
That's a real thing?

112
00:04:24,953 --> 00:04:28,054
Yeah. Their slogan is
"We're all about dating

113
00:04:28,056 --> 00:04:30,557
and not the carbon-14 kind"

114
00:04:32,361 --> 00:04:34,661
Well, have
a lovely evening.

115
00:04:34,663 --> 00:04:36,530
Thanks. You, too.

116
00:04:37,599 --> 00:04:39,065
If you think
that's more fun than talking

117
00:04:39,067 --> 00:04:41,501
to Zachary Quinto through
a stall door, you're crazy.

118
00:04:44,506 --> 00:04:45,805
You know, we could've come
to you guys.

119
00:04:45,807 --> 00:04:47,340
You didn't have to bring
the baby here.

120
00:04:47,342 --> 00:04:49,009
Oh, it's okay. It's good
to get out of the house.

121
00:04:49,011 --> 00:04:50,544
And the car ride
puts her to sleep.

122
00:04:50,546 --> 00:04:53,079
Aw, that used to work
with Sheldon.

123
00:04:53,081 --> 00:04:56,449
Yeah, until someone left him
in the drugstore parking lot

124
00:04:56,451 --> 00:04:57,817
and he freaked out.

125
00:04:57,819 --> 00:04:59,486
Who forgot to crack the window?

126
00:05:00,255 --> 00:05:01,521
Hello!

127
00:05:01,523 --> 00:05:02,822
- Hey.
- Oh,

128
00:05:02,824 --> 00:05:04,324
someone's been shopping
at Gucci.

129
00:05:04,326 --> 00:05:07,193
Yeah, I saw something for Halley
and I couldn't resist.

130
00:05:07,195 --> 00:05:09,029
That's so
sweet of you.

131
00:05:09,031 --> 00:05:12,866
Yeah, it's a crushed velvet
baby cape.

132
00:05:13,936 --> 00:05:17,437
Oh, no, now we have two.

133
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:20,574
That must've been expensive.
Yeah, it was.

134
00:05:20,576 --> 00:05:23,810
But it's my father's money
and I'm mad at him.

135
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:25,946
What's going on with your dad?

136
00:05:25,948 --> 00:05:27,147
And if you really want
to hurt him,

137
00:05:27,149 --> 00:05:28,882
I look great in Chanel.

138
00:05:28,884 --> 00:05:32,519
It turns out he doesn't care
if I'm married or if I'm single.

139
00:05:32,521 --> 00:05:34,354
He's basically given up on me.

140
00:05:34,356 --> 00:05:36,423
Oh, I'm sure that's not true.

141
00:05:36,425 --> 00:05:39,326
It is. He stopped trying to find
Indian girls for me to marry.

142
00:05:39,328 --> 00:05:41,561
All you did was complain
when he did that.

143
00:05:41,563 --> 00:05:44,531
Leonard, he's hurting.
Let him feel how he feels.

144
00:05:44,533 --> 00:05:46,333
Thank you, Penny.
Yeah.

145
00:05:46,335 --> 00:05:48,468
Shoes, I'm a seven-and-a-half;
boots, I'm an eight.

146
00:05:51,306 --> 00:05:53,506
MSN Search,

147
00:05:53,508 --> 00:05:55,508
AltaVista,

148
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:58,511
and... Ask Jeeves.

149
00:05:58,513 --> 00:05:59,846
You?

150
00:05:59,848 --> 00:06:01,448
Sorry, I don't have a list

151
00:06:01,450 --> 00:06:04,117
of defunct search engines
that I miss.

152
00:06:06,054 --> 00:06:07,887
Hey. Looks like I got stood up,

153
00:06:07,889 --> 00:06:09,422
so I'm gonna head out.

154
00:06:09,424 --> 00:06:10,924
Oh, no. Are you sure
you don't want to give her

155
00:06:10,926 --> 00:06:11,992
a few more minutes?

156
00:06:11,994 --> 00:06:15,095
Nah, G-Harmony recommends
after two hours,

157
00:06:15,097 --> 00:06:18,131
it's time to cut bait.

158
00:06:20,035 --> 00:06:20,967
I'm so sorry.

159
00:06:20,969 --> 00:06:23,703
Bert, I insist
that you join us.

160
00:06:23,705 --> 00:06:25,572
You really wouldn't mind?

161
00:06:25,574 --> 00:06:27,140
Not at all. Amy?

162
00:06:27,142 --> 00:06:28,408
Fine with me.

163
00:06:28,410 --> 00:06:30,910
Thanks. I'll go grab a chair.

164
00:06:30,912 --> 00:06:34,114
Sheldon, that was so sweet
of you.

165
00:06:34,116 --> 00:06:36,316
Well, I could deduce
by his facial expression

166
00:06:36,318 --> 00:06:38,518
and body language
that he was sad.

167
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:42,789
So the part where he got
stood up didn't clue you in?

168
00:06:42,791 --> 00:06:47,794
You want me to look at him
and listen to him?

169
00:06:48,997 --> 00:06:52,165
My father thinks the reason
I can't make a relationship work

170
00:06:52,167 --> 00:06:53,833
is because I'm spoiled.

171
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:02,509
I'm sorry, is he waiting
for someone to disagree?

172
00:07:02,511 --> 00:07:04,444
Just because he helps me out

173
00:07:04,446 --> 00:07:07,180
doesn't automatically mean
that I'm spoiled.

174
00:07:07,182 --> 00:07:08,902
All right, how much exactly
does he pay for?

175
00:07:10,485 --> 00:07:12,485
Okay,
I'll tell you,

176
00:07:12,487 --> 00:07:13,953
but please don't judge me.

177
00:07:13,955 --> 00:07:17,924
He pays for my car, my rent,
and my credit cards.

178
00:07:20,228 --> 00:07:23,029
I'm trying, but I'm judging.

179
00:07:24,066 --> 00:07:26,533
Maybe your dad's right.

180
00:07:26,535 --> 00:07:28,868
Yeah, women do like a man
that can support himself.

181
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:30,470
But Bernadette makes
more money than Howard.

182
00:07:30,472 --> 00:07:33,606
She basically
supports him.

183
00:07:33,608 --> 00:07:36,209
Yeah, maybe your
dad's right.

184
00:07:39,081 --> 00:07:41,981
Good question. Let's see.

185
00:07:41,983 --> 00:07:43,850
Infoseek,

186
00:07:43,852 --> 00:07:45,719
WebCrawler,

187
00:07:45,721 --> 00:07:47,620
oh, HotBot.

188
00:07:47,622 --> 00:07:50,356
Okay, literally
any other topic.

189
00:07:51,126 --> 00:07:54,294
All right.
How did you guys meet?

190
00:07:54,296 --> 00:07:56,463
Actually, we met online.

191
00:07:56,465 --> 00:07:58,465
Our-our first date
was at a coffee shop.

192
00:07:58,467 --> 00:08:01,534
Although, unlike your date,
she actually showed up.

193
00:08:02,838 --> 00:08:04,904
Oh, he looks sad again.

194
00:08:05,774 --> 00:08:08,808
Well, I really envy
your relationship.

195
00:08:08,810 --> 00:08:11,377
Other than you two only
having sex once a year,

196
00:08:11,379 --> 00:08:13,980
you're the perfect couple.

197
00:08:15,484 --> 00:08:17,417
You-you know about that?

198
00:08:17,419 --> 00:08:20,620
Uh, yeah, everyone at
the university does.

199
00:08:20,622 --> 00:08:22,756
Were you aware of this?

200
00:08:22,758 --> 00:08:26,793
No. No, I only told Leonard,
Howard, Raj,

201
00:08:26,795 --> 00:08:30,063
Kripke, uh, Professor Wu,
Professor Klein,

202
00:08:30,065 --> 00:08:33,032
and a lunch lady
in the cafeteria.

203
00:08:33,034 --> 00:08:36,469
How everyone else found out
is a mystery to me.

204
00:08:47,013 --> 00:08:49,080
Why aren't you
talking to me?

205
00:08:49,082 --> 00:08:51,082
- Because I'm mad at you.
- Oh.

206
00:08:51,084 --> 00:08:54,385
Well, now I'm sorry I asked.

207
00:08:54,387 --> 00:08:56,320
Sheldon, it's humiliating.

208
00:08:56,322 --> 00:08:59,490
Thanks to you, my colleagues are
gossiping about our sex life.

209
00:08:59,492 --> 00:09:00,992
What is there to gossip about?

210
00:09:00,994 --> 00:09:03,327
We barely have one.

211
00:09:04,164 --> 00:09:06,864
That's why they're doing it!

212
00:09:10,069 --> 00:09:13,905
Is it safe to assume
you're not speaking to me again?

213
00:09:15,175 --> 00:09:17,842
If you're not answering because
you're not speaking to me,

214
00:09:17,844 --> 00:09:19,744
perhaps we could come up
with a signal!

215
00:09:24,717 --> 00:09:26,417
That works!

216
00:09:28,955 --> 00:09:30,454
You don't need your dad's money.

217
00:09:30,456 --> 00:09:32,757
- You can get by on your salary.
- Yeah.

218
00:09:32,759 --> 00:09:34,926
Well, we work at the
same place as you, and

219
00:09:34,928 --> 00:09:36,527
- we've always been fine.
- Oh, please.

220
00:09:36,529 --> 00:09:39,864
Look in the mirror. You both
look ten years older than I do.

221
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:42,466
All right.

222
00:09:42,468 --> 00:09:43,801
Hang on. We can
figure this out.

223
00:09:43,803 --> 00:09:46,470
Let's just go over your
expenses. How much is your rent?

224
00:09:46,472 --> 00:09:48,306
I don't want to say.

225
00:09:48,308 --> 00:09:50,508
Is it really
that high?

226
00:09:50,510 --> 00:09:53,811
I don't want to say because
I don't know how much it is.

227
00:09:53,813 --> 00:09:56,113
You don't how much
your rent is?

228
00:09:56,115 --> 00:09:58,007
My father pays for it! Do you
know how much your rent is?

229
00:09:58,031 --> 00:09:58,984
Yeah.

230
00:09:58,985 --> 00:10:00,284
Well, then double it,

231
00:10:00,286 --> 00:10:02,320
because my building's
a lot nicer than this dump.

232
00:10:03,456 --> 00:10:06,457
Do you know how
much your car costs?

233
00:10:06,459 --> 00:10:07,525
Not really.

234
00:10:07,527 --> 00:10:09,560
Well, how much
do you spend on food?

235
00:10:09,562 --> 00:10:12,597
The housekeeper
does the shopping.

236
00:10:13,433 --> 00:10:16,167
Oh, my God, you
really are spoiled.

237
00:10:16,169 --> 00:10:17,468
I'm spoiled?

238
00:10:17,470 --> 00:10:21,172
Your baby has a cape
that costs $300!

239
00:10:26,779 --> 00:10:27,878
I'm going to bed.

240
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:29,380
Well, wait.

241
00:10:29,382 --> 00:10:33,217
This is our first fight as
a couple who live together.

242
00:10:33,219 --> 00:10:34,485
So?

243
00:10:34,487 --> 00:10:36,754
I'm not sure of the protocol.

244
00:10:36,756 --> 00:10:38,055
Television teaches us

245
00:10:38,057 --> 00:10:39,657
that the man's supposed
to sleep on the couch,

246
00:10:39,659 --> 00:10:43,294
but of the two of us,
you're clearly more sofa-sized.

247
00:10:43,296 --> 00:10:45,162
I'm not sleeping on the couch

248
00:10:45,164 --> 00:10:47,565
'cause you don't know
what's private and what's not.

249
00:10:47,567 --> 00:10:49,600
This isn't fair.

250
00:10:49,602 --> 00:10:50,968
You've discussed aspects

251
00:10:50,970 --> 00:10:52,803
of our physical relationship
with Penny.

252
00:10:52,805 --> 00:10:54,238
That's different!

253
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,807
She's a close friend,
not the lady in the cafeteria

254
00:10:56,809 --> 00:10:59,644
who cuts the crust off
your sandwiches!

255
00:10:59,646 --> 00:11:01,245
That lady has a name.

256
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:02,780
I don't know what it is,

257
00:11:02,782 --> 00:11:05,182
but one time,
I accidentally called her "Mom".

258
00:11:08,421 --> 00:11:10,821
Sounds like you're gonna
need a cheaper place to live.

259
00:11:10,823 --> 00:11:12,990
When you moved here,
you didn't have a lot of money.

260
00:11:12,992 --> 00:11:14,058
How'd you get by?

261
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:16,193
Well, sometimes
you can get free food

262
00:11:16,195 --> 00:11:19,063
and Wi-Fi from the neighbors.

263
00:11:19,065 --> 00:11:20,531
Just know

264
00:11:20,533 --> 00:11:23,601
you might have
to marry one of 'em.

265
00:11:24,570 --> 00:11:26,170
Hey, you guys let Stuart
live with you.

266
00:11:26,172 --> 00:11:27,338
Why not Raj, too?

267
00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:30,007
What-what are you doing? I...

268
00:11:31,544 --> 00:11:34,612
I-I-I schlepped the baby over,
I brought imported beer.

269
00:11:34,614 --> 00:11:36,514
Why don't you like me?

270
00:11:36,516 --> 00:11:37,615
Well,

271
00:11:37,617 --> 00:11:38,936
I thought
we were best friends!

272
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:39,951
We are!

273
00:11:39,952 --> 00:11:43,487
That's why I'm sad my best
friend's gonna be homeless.

274
00:11:45,625 --> 00:11:48,726
I'm sorry, Raj. We really
just don't have the space.

275
00:11:48,728 --> 00:11:50,127
What if he lives in your garage?

276
00:11:50,129 --> 00:11:52,463
What if you stop helping?

277
00:11:53,833 --> 00:11:56,667
Guys, I'm not living
in a garage!

278
00:11:56,669 --> 00:11:58,803
Wait. Why are we talking
about our place

279
00:11:58,805 --> 00:12:02,573
when Sheldon's old room is
sitting there perfectly empty?

280
00:12:04,711 --> 00:12:06,477
That's a great idea.

281
00:12:06,479 --> 00:12:08,913
Raj,

282
00:12:08,915 --> 00:12:12,149
if you need a place to stay,
of course you are welcome here.

283
00:12:12,151 --> 00:12:16,320
Thank you, but if I'm gonna just
take advantage of my friends,

284
00:12:16,322 --> 00:12:19,156
I might as well keep on
relying on my father.

285
00:12:19,158 --> 00:12:20,558
Okay, only if you're sure.

286
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:21,926
Whew.

287
00:12:21,928 --> 00:12:24,328
Yeah.

288
00:12:25,431 --> 00:12:27,431
Amy?

289
00:12:27,433 --> 00:12:28,699
Amy?

290
00:12:28,701 --> 00:12:31,035
Amy?
Yeah?

291
00:12:32,071 --> 00:12:34,839
Not exactly the welcome wagon,
but I'll take it.

292
00:12:36,776 --> 00:12:38,909
What is this?

293
00:12:38,911 --> 00:12:41,746
I'm mapping basic topics
of conversation

294
00:12:41,748 --> 00:12:44,448
and with whom
they can be discussed.

295
00:12:44,450 --> 00:12:48,819
I call these circles
"Zones of Privacy"

296
00:12:48,821 --> 00:12:50,087
Don't Google that

297
00:12:50,089 --> 00:12:52,556
unless you want to see pictures
of people's genitals.

298
00:12:52,558 --> 00:12:56,293
This circle contains
only me and you.

299
00:12:56,295 --> 00:12:59,163
It represents subjects we
only share with each other...

300
00:12:59,165 --> 00:13:03,000
details of physical intimacy,
bathroom habits.

301
00:13:03,002 --> 00:13:04,835
Although, as I'm saying it,

302
00:13:04,837 --> 00:13:08,739
I may need
to add Dr. Fink in here.

303
00:13:08,741 --> 00:13:10,141
Are you really worried

304
00:13:10,143 --> 00:13:12,476
about revealing secrets
to Stephen Hawking?

305
00:13:12,478 --> 00:13:17,114
No, I was just excited
to list him as a friend.

306
00:13:17,116 --> 00:13:20,351
Well, I do appreciate
you working on this.

307
00:13:22,121 --> 00:13:24,021
I'm sorry you were embarrassed.

308
00:13:24,023 --> 00:13:25,890
And now I understand that

309
00:13:25,892 --> 00:13:28,225
some things are just
between you and me,

310
00:13:28,227 --> 00:13:32,730
and in the event of redness
and swelling, Dr. Fink.

311
00:13:35,034 --> 00:13:36,834
What's that little dot
in the middle?

312
00:13:36,836 --> 00:13:40,070
That's reserved for thoughts
I don't share with anyone.

313
00:13:40,072 --> 00:13:44,375
Interesting. You really
have secrets you don't tell me?

314
00:13:44,377 --> 00:13:45,943
Of course.

315
00:13:45,945 --> 00:13:47,645
Can I hear one?

316
00:13:47,647 --> 00:13:49,680
No, they're private.

317
00:13:49,682 --> 00:13:53,584
Why? Are they naughty?

318
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:56,620
A little.

319
00:13:56,622 --> 00:13:58,289
Please?

320
00:13:58,291 --> 00:14:00,491
Fine.

321
00:14:01,661 --> 00:14:03,828
Two years ago...

322
00:14:05,031 --> 00:14:07,731
I got my driver's license.

323
00:14:08,568 --> 00:14:11,001
What?

324
00:14:12,271 --> 00:14:14,271
Why didn't
you say anything?

325
00:14:14,273 --> 00:14:17,675
I like being
chauffeured around.

326
00:14:17,677 --> 00:14:20,277
It makes me feel important.

327
00:14:21,914 --> 00:14:24,982
So when I got up at 4:00 a.m.
to drive you across the desert

328
00:14:24,984 --> 00:14:27,918
to an antique train museum,
I didn't have to?

329
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:29,186
No, you didn't.

330
00:14:29,188 --> 00:14:30,988
But keep in mind,

331
00:14:30,990 --> 00:14:34,158
I felt extremely important.

332
00:14:39,966 --> 00:14:42,466
What?

333
00:14:42,468 --> 00:14:43,701
Hello, Father.

334
00:14:43,703 --> 00:14:44,969
We need to talk.

335
00:14:44,971 --> 00:14:46,370
All right.

336
00:14:46,372 --> 00:14:48,105
I have come
to an important decision.

337
00:14:48,107 --> 00:14:49,940
I will not be accepting
your money anymore.

338
00:14:49,942 --> 00:14:52,676
I'm a man,
and I can take care of myself.

339
00:14:52,678 --> 00:14:54,345
That's wonderful!

340
00:14:54,347 --> 00:14:55,646
Yes, that is wonderful!

341
00:14:55,648 --> 00:14:57,848
You will no longer be able
to accuse me of being spoiled!

342
00:14:57,850 --> 00:14:59,750
I am so proud of you.

343
00:14:59,752 --> 00:15:00,985
Dad, I'm trying to tell you off,

344
00:15:00,987 --> 00:15:03,888
and you're ruining it
with your delight and relief.

345
00:15:05,291 --> 00:15:06,724
Sorry.

346
00:15:06,726 --> 00:15:09,860
Oh, no, my grown son is going
to stop spending all my money.

347
00:15:09,862 --> 00:15:12,796
Where did I fail as a father?

348
00:15:12,798 --> 00:15:14,832
Yeah, that's right.

349
00:15:14,834 --> 00:15:16,367
Keep asking yourself that!

350
00:15:17,603 --> 00:15:21,138
But I still love you very much,
so don't cut me out of the will.

351
00:15:29,613 --> 00:15:31,046
Oh, you brought
your own lunch.

352
00:15:31,048 --> 00:15:32,214
Good for you.

353
00:15:32,216 --> 00:15:34,349
Yeah, I'm making a bunch
of changes.

354
00:15:34,351 --> 00:15:36,518
This morning,
I fired my dog walker.

355
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:38,921
Oh. How's the dog gonna go
to the bathroom?

356
00:15:38,923 --> 00:15:40,489
Uh, I gave her an Imodium.

357
00:15:40,491 --> 00:15:42,257
That's tomorrow's problem.

358
00:15:44,028 --> 00:15:47,162
Excuse me. May I have
your attention, please?

359
00:15:47,164 --> 00:15:48,697
I have recently

360
00:15:48,699 --> 00:15:51,467
been made aware
that my personal relationship

361
00:15:51,469 --> 00:15:54,670
with Amy Farrah Fowler has
become water cooler gossip.

362
00:15:54,672 --> 00:15:58,574
And I just want to say,
shame on all of you.

363
00:15:59,610 --> 00:16:01,243
We're scientists.

364
00:16:01,245 --> 00:16:02,511
Our minds should be focused

365
00:16:02,513 --> 00:16:04,980
on the advancement
of human knowledge,

366
00:16:04,982 --> 00:16:07,483
not the intimate details
of other people's lives.

367
00:16:07,485 --> 00:16:10,018
He's right.

368
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:12,588
And I'm sorry for the part
I played in this.

369
00:16:12,590 --> 00:16:14,289
Thank you, Bert.

370
00:16:14,291 --> 00:16:17,392
You're a good man. That
woman who stood you up

371
00:16:17,394 --> 00:16:19,962
and humiliated you last
night really missed out.

372
00:16:21,365 --> 00:16:24,633
That doesn't paint me
in the best light.

373
00:16:24,635 --> 00:16:26,735
Oh. Oh, I'm sorry.

374
00:16:26,737 --> 00:16:31,840
Correction: That woman not only
had vigorous coitus with Bert...

375
00:16:31,842 --> 00:16:35,978
she also tipped him a
dollar for a job well done.

376
00:16:38,716 --> 00:16:41,150
- That better?
- Not really.

377
00:16:42,753 --> 00:16:45,788
All right, well, to sum up...
focus on science,

378
00:16:45,790 --> 00:16:48,023
keep your nose out
of other people's business,

379
00:16:48,025 --> 00:16:50,793
and, uh, whoa,
for a good time, call Bert.

380
00:16:57,968 --> 00:17:00,002
What brought that on?

381
00:17:00,004 --> 00:17:02,404
Well, last night Amy was angry

382
00:17:02,406 --> 00:17:04,907
with me because I'd been
foolishly telling people

383
00:17:04,909 --> 00:17:06,775
about certain personal matters.

384
00:17:06,777 --> 00:17:08,544
That's understandable.

385
00:17:08,546 --> 00:17:10,012
Oh, I know that now.

386
00:17:10,014 --> 00:17:11,880
At first, I thought
she was cranky

387
00:17:11,882 --> 00:17:14,349
because of her horrific
menstrual cramps, but...

388
00:17:15,319 --> 00:17:18,020
it turns out, no, she
was genuinely mortified.

389
00:17:19,613 --> 00:17:26,413
