2
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:03,331
Dad,
this is Sheldon's mother, Mary.

3
00:00:03,517 --> 00:00:04,214
How do you do?

4
00:00:04,214 --> 00:00:05,431
Nice to meet you.

5
00:00:05,432 --> 00:00:06,464
And, of course, Mom.

6
00:00:06,466 --> 00:00:08,634
Hello, my hateful shrew.

7
00:00:08,635 --> 00:00:12,221
Hello to you,
you wrinkled old bastard.

8
00:00:14,391 --> 00:00:15,556
Hey.

9
00:00:15,559 --> 00:00:18,359
Just got an e-mail
from the U.S. Air Force.

10
00:00:18,361 --> 00:00:22,448
I'm just afraid if I respond,
then they'll know I got it.

11
00:00:22,449 --> 00:00:24,949
Dude, the minute you opened that
e-mail, they knew you got it.

12
00:00:24,952 --> 00:00:25,867
I mean, they're probably
looking at you

13
00:00:25,870 --> 00:00:28,821
through the camera
right now.

14
00:00:28,823 --> 00:00:30,571
Oh, God.

15
00:00:30,574 --> 00:00:32,790
I think someone's
following us.

16
00:00:34,161 --> 00:00:36,462
Uh, turn left here
and see if he turns with us.

17
00:00:36,463 --> 00:00:38,496
Why is he turning here?
The restaurant's the other way.

18
00:00:38,499 --> 00:00:40,665
I don't know.
He uses that traffic app.

19
00:00:40,667 --> 00:00:42,000
Maybe there's an accident.

20
00:00:42,002 --> 00:00:43,585
Oh, so follow him.

21
00:00:43,587 --> 00:00:46,472
Oh, no!

22
00:00:47,307 --> 00:00:48,390
Leonard, if you don't mind,

23
00:00:48,392 --> 00:00:49,640
I think I'm a little tired.

24
00:00:49,643 --> 00:00:50,725
I'm gonna call it a night.

25
00:00:50,728 --> 00:00:51,926
Sure, Dad.

26
00:00:51,929 --> 00:00:53,679
I'm a little
tuckered out myself.

27
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:56,899
Well, I will see you
all in the morning.

28
00:00:56,901 --> 00:00:58,350
Would you like to share a cab?

29
00:00:58,351 --> 00:00:59,435
That would be fine.

30
00:00:59,436 --> 00:01:01,186
Where are you staying?
I'm at the Westin.

31
00:01:01,188 --> 00:01:02,271
Well, so am I.

32
00:01:02,273 --> 00:01:03,655
Could I interest
you in a nightcap?

33
00:01:03,656 --> 00:01:05,524
I think that you could.

34
00:01:10,197 --> 00:01:13,531
Leonard?

35
00:01:13,534 --> 00:01:15,867
Leonard?

36
00:01:15,870 --> 00:01:17,085
What?

37
00:01:17,087 --> 00:01:20,421
You realize you and I
could become brothers.

38
00:01:21,292 --> 00:01:23,207
We're not gonna be brothers.

39
00:01:23,210 --> 00:01:24,676
We're not gonna be stepbrothers.

40
00:01:24,677 --> 00:01:26,210
Go to sleep.

41
00:01:26,212 --> 00:01:28,212
I hope you're right.

42
00:01:28,215 --> 00:01:30,048
'Cause a grown man
living with his brother

43
00:01:30,049 --> 00:01:33,301
and his brother's wife is weird.

44
00:01:33,304 --> 00:01:35,637
Go to sleep.

45
00:01:35,639 --> 00:01:37,805
Okay.

46
00:01:40,561 --> 00:01:42,478
Do you think your father's
doing unspeakable things

47
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:45,229
to my mother?

48
00:01:45,231 --> 00:01:46,397
No.

49
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,733
Are you saying that

50
00:01:47,734 --> 00:01:49,951
because the things
are unspeakable?

51
00:01:49,954 --> 00:01:51,152
Your parents are old.

52
00:01:51,155 --> 00:01:53,155
Anything unspeakable
was finished by 9:30.

53
00:01:53,156 --> 00:01:54,372
Go to sleep.

54
00:01:55,209 --> 00:01:57,408
Very well.

55
00:01:59,246 --> 00:02:02,965
I'm sorry if this stuff is gonna
make the ceremony awkward.

56
00:02:02,966 --> 00:02:04,715
God, I thought my brother
fresh out of jail

57
00:02:04,718 --> 00:02:06,477
was gonna make everyone
uncomfortable, but now this...

58
00:02:06,501 --> 00:02:07,170
Hey, if you want me to sleep

59
00:02:07,171 --> 00:02:09,972
you're gonna
have to stop talking.

@elder_man

70
00:02:38,942 --> 00:02:40,525
Okay, I'm gonna go pick up
my family.

71
00:02:40,526 --> 00:02:42,944
Like an hour and half,
two hours, depending on traffic.

72
00:02:42,945 --> 00:02:44,111
Yeah, drive safe.
Oh, hey,

73
00:02:44,114 --> 00:02:45,379
and do yourself a favor,
all right?

74
00:02:45,382 --> 00:02:48,515
When Beverly gets here,
do not bring up last night.

75
00:02:48,518 --> 00:02:49,616
All right?
As far as you're concerned,

76
00:02:49,618 --> 00:02:51,819
you don't know anything,

77
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:52,836
you didn't see anything.

78
00:02:52,838 --> 00:02:57,292
I want you just to play dumb.

79
00:02:57,293 --> 00:03:00,344
It was nice of her to show us
playing dumb with an example.

80
00:03:00,347 --> 00:03:01,763
What?

81
00:03:01,764 --> 00:03:03,463
Oh.

82
00:03:03,466 --> 00:03:05,633
Hi. Okay, hey there, I got—
I'm sorry, I got to go now.

83
00:03:05,634 --> 00:03:08,552
Penny, wait.
Why?

84
00:03:08,555 --> 00:03:11,438
I wanted to thank you for
going through all the trouble

85
00:03:11,441 --> 00:03:14,692
of planning a second wedding
ceremony for me,

86
00:03:14,693 --> 00:03:16,860
but unfortunately
I cannot attend.

87
00:03:16,862 --> 00:03:18,979
Well, why?
What's wrong?

88
00:03:18,981 --> 00:03:20,615
Wha— are we still doing
the dumb thing?

89
00:03:20,616 --> 00:03:22,699
Okay, why, what's wrong?

90
00:03:22,701 --> 00:03:24,868
I just cannot stay here
while your father

91
00:03:24,871 --> 00:03:27,070
goes out of his way
to humiliate me.

92
00:03:27,073 --> 00:03:30,207
Oh, golly, however
did he humiliate you?

93
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:31,825
Stop it, Sheldon.

94
00:03:31,828 --> 00:03:35,329
Do I say "Stop what?"
or just throw in the towel?

95
00:03:35,331 --> 00:03:37,548
I don't see why I should
have to watch your father

96
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:40,752
parade around with some
Bible-thumping bumpkin.

97
00:03:40,753 --> 00:03:43,137
Oh, excuse me, that is my mother
you're talking about,

98
00:03:43,139 --> 00:03:45,340
however accurately.

99
00:03:45,341 --> 00:03:46,841
Okay, Beverly,

100
00:03:46,843 --> 00:03:48,009
aren't you overreacting
a little?

101
00:03:48,010 --> 00:03:50,177
All we know is they shared
a cab and had a nightcap.

102
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:51,396
And turned their phones off.

103
00:03:51,397 --> 00:03:54,682
Not helping, buddy.

104
00:03:54,683 --> 00:03:57,151
Mother, Penny and I really want
you to be part of this.

105
00:03:57,152 --> 00:03:58,269
Please stay.

106
00:03:58,271 --> 00:03:59,236
Yeah, plus if you leave,

107
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:01,188
Alfred will know
he got under your skin.

108
00:04:04,661 --> 00:04:06,693
Well, we can't have that.

109
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,580
You know, also,
if they did have coitus,

110
00:04:09,581 --> 00:04:11,782
we'll all be needing
a skilled psychiatrist.

111
00:04:15,087 --> 00:04:17,538
It is funny
when you think about it.

112
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:18,588
Maybe to you.

113
00:04:18,591 --> 00:04:20,757
You didn't get
a $500 traffic ticket.

114
00:04:20,759 --> 00:04:24,095
Because you were driving
like a lunatic.

115
00:04:24,096 --> 00:04:25,879
Hey, if thinking
secret government agents

116
00:04:25,882 --> 00:04:30,050
are chasing you makes you
a lunatic, then... yeah, okay.

117
00:04:32,137 --> 00:04:35,189
Oh, I'll get it.

118
00:04:35,191 --> 00:04:36,891
It didn't help that you couldn't
walk a straight line

119
00:04:36,893 --> 00:04:39,060
when the cop pulled you over.

120
00:04:39,062 --> 00:04:42,730
I have performance anxiety.

121
00:04:43,817 --> 00:04:46,817
You of all people
should know that.

122
00:04:56,579 --> 00:04:58,745
Hello.

123
00:04:58,747 --> 00:05:00,497
I'm looking for Howard Wolowitz.

124
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:04,584
Howard Wolowitz?

125
00:05:04,586 --> 00:05:06,803
I have the right address,
don't I?

126
00:05:06,805 --> 00:05:09,589
Address?

127
00:05:09,591 --> 00:05:11,225
Is he here?

128
00:05:11,226 --> 00:05:14,928
Um... no.

129
00:05:14,930 --> 00:05:16,980
Do you know where
I can find him?

130
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:19,317
May I ask what this is about?

131
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:20,768
No, you may not.

132
00:05:20,769 --> 00:05:22,153
Very well.

133
00:05:26,576 --> 00:05:28,442
Have him call me.

134
00:05:28,444 --> 00:05:29,660
Okay.

135
00:05:29,661 --> 00:05:31,946
Raj, who's at the door?

136
00:05:35,617 --> 00:05:38,619
That's not him.

137
00:05:39,788 --> 00:05:42,173
Oh, I can't wait for
you to meet everyone.

138
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:43,957
I told them all about you.

139
00:05:43,959 --> 00:05:45,459
Like what?

140
00:05:45,461 --> 00:05:46,793
Do they know about your brother?

141
00:05:46,795 --> 00:05:50,715
Uh, not everything, just,
like, the jail and drugs part.

142
00:05:50,716 --> 00:05:52,766
Why would you do that?

143
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:54,134
What?
The world doesn't need

144
00:05:54,137 --> 00:05:55,470
to know our problems.

145
00:05:55,471 --> 00:05:56,471
Well, Mom, I'm sorry, but...

146
00:05:56,473 --> 00:05:59,189
Hey, look, they got
Walgreens here, too.

147
00:06:00,476 --> 00:06:03,360
You really think it's helpful
to change the subject, Wyatt?

148
00:06:03,362 --> 00:06:05,646
Just trying to make this
a happy trip, dear.

149
00:06:05,648 --> 00:06:07,481
Well, quit it!

150
00:06:09,619 --> 00:06:11,819
So, uh, Randall,
can't believe

151
00:06:11,821 --> 00:06:13,286
after all these years
you finally get to visit me

152
00:06:13,288 --> 00:06:14,622
in California.

153
00:06:14,624 --> 00:06:16,540
Well, good thing I was
a nonviolent offender,

154
00:06:16,543 --> 00:06:18,576
otherwise I couldn't
have left the state.

155
00:06:18,577 --> 00:06:22,497
All right,
that's enough jail talk.

156
00:06:22,499 --> 00:06:25,550
Penny knows where I was;
she sent me cigarettes.

157
00:06:25,552 --> 00:06:28,252
You sent
your brother cigarettes?

158
00:06:28,254 --> 00:06:30,004
He was cooking and selling
crystal meth, Susan,

159
00:06:30,005 --> 00:06:33,173
I think we can
let the cigarettes slide.

160
00:06:33,175 --> 00:06:34,925
Stop trying to be
the cool dad;

161
00:06:34,927 --> 00:06:38,762
you have a shirt
with our cat's picture on it.

162
00:06:38,764 --> 00:06:41,231
Anyway, we're here, slugger.

163
00:06:44,019 --> 00:06:46,903
That's great, now they
know where I live.

164
00:06:46,906 --> 00:06:48,156
What are you talking about?

165
00:06:48,158 --> 00:06:49,689
They've always known
where you live.

166
00:06:49,692 --> 00:06:50,858
Yeah, if you want to go
off the grid,

167
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:52,579
you have to move out
of your mother's house.

168
00:06:54,413 --> 00:06:56,581
Can we take a moment
to discuss

169
00:06:56,582 --> 00:06:58,749
that I just lied
to the government for you?

170
00:06:58,750 --> 00:06:59,867
Yeah.

171
00:06:59,869 --> 00:07:02,036
I would not have
done that for you.

172
00:07:03,173 --> 00:07:06,007
Howard, please just call
the man, see what he wants.

173
00:07:06,009 --> 00:07:07,925
All right, all right.

174
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:09,377
Hey,

175
00:07:09,379 --> 00:07:11,428
make sure you tell him that
you weren't home when he came by

176
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:13,430
and that your Indian friend
gave you the message

177
00:07:13,432 --> 00:07:16,100
the moment
you stepped through the door.

178
00:07:16,101 --> 00:07:19,720
Yes, hello.
Uh,

179
00:07:19,721 --> 00:07:22,807
this is Howard Wolowitz
for Colonel Richard Williams.

180
00:07:22,809 --> 00:07:24,475
Oh, I take it back,
don't mention me.

181
00:07:24,476 --> 00:07:27,562
Hi, Colonel Williams,
how can I help you?

182
00:07:27,564 --> 00:07:30,865
What? Oh, uh, yes,
he is from India.

183
00:07:32,784 --> 00:07:35,903
No, I don't know
his immigration status.

184
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:41,908
Relax, I'm still on hold!

185
00:07:43,413 --> 00:07:45,495
Speaking.

186
00:07:45,497 --> 00:07:49,667
Okay, sure,
I can meet with you on Thursday.

187
00:07:49,668 --> 00:07:51,252
Caltech is fine.

188
00:07:51,254 --> 00:07:53,420
Yeah, and may I ask
what this is about?

189
00:07:54,807 --> 00:07:56,757
I may not?

190
00:07:56,759 --> 00:07:59,759
That's what he said to me.

191
00:08:00,896 --> 00:08:02,012
Here you are, Mother.

192
00:08:02,014 --> 00:08:03,648
Thank you.

193
00:08:03,649 --> 00:08:05,315
I'm glad you decided to stay.

194
00:08:05,317 --> 00:08:08,769
It's gonna be special for Penny
and me to share this with you.

195
00:08:08,771 --> 00:08:12,490
I can't wait
for this day to be over.

196
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:15,692
Yeah, special, like that.

197
00:08:16,528 --> 00:08:19,112
That's them.

198
00:08:19,115 --> 00:08:20,113
Please don't make things

199
00:08:20,115 --> 00:08:22,082
any more awkward
than they already are.

200
00:08:22,084 --> 00:08:26,170
All right, so less
or equally awkward, got it.

201
00:08:27,673 --> 00:08:28,755
Hey, guys, come on in.

202
00:08:28,757 --> 00:08:30,423
Oh, thank you.
Good morning.

203
00:08:30,425 --> 00:08:31,341
Morning.
Hello.

204
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:33,344
How is everyone today?

205
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:34,345
Good, and you?

206
00:08:34,346 --> 00:08:36,429
Good, good.
Good.

207
00:08:36,432 --> 00:08:37,798
I'm good, too.

208
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:39,683
Good.

209
00:08:42,471 --> 00:08:44,688
So, did you defile
my mother or not?

210
00:08:45,642 --> 00:08:48,192
Sheldon!

211
00:08:48,193 --> 00:08:50,278
You're being rude.

212
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:51,696
If I may, I can assure you,

213
00:08:51,697 --> 00:08:53,147
your mother and I
did nothing more

214
00:08:53,149 --> 00:08:55,365
than share a cab
and a conversation.

215
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:57,534
Did that conversation
include the phrase

216
00:08:57,537 --> 00:08:59,703
"your genitals
are a joy to behold"?

217
00:08:59,706 --> 00:09:01,905
That's enough!

218
00:09:01,908 --> 00:09:06,876
Look, I promise you, neither I,
nor anyone, has ever said that.

219
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:11,548
You don't know his girlfriend
very well.

220
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:14,668
Or what a joy it is
to behold my genitals.

221
00:09:16,838 --> 00:09:19,340
All right, you guys, uh,
get settled in,

222
00:09:19,341 --> 00:09:21,591
then we'll go across the hall
and say hi to everyone.

223
00:09:21,594 --> 00:09:24,061
You know, It's hard to believe
I've never met Leonard.

224
00:09:24,062 --> 00:09:26,346
Well, he probably buys
his illegal drugs

225
00:09:26,349 --> 00:09:27,514
from a local vendor.

226
00:09:28,934 --> 00:09:30,484
Not funny, Wyatt.

227
00:09:30,485 --> 00:09:33,019
I thought it was really funny.
Thanks.

228
00:09:33,022 --> 00:09:36,407
Well, fine, if everyone wants to
make jokes about our problems,

229
00:09:36,408 --> 00:09:37,357
then I can, too.

230
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,693
Knock, knock.
Who's there?

231
00:09:39,696 --> 00:09:42,413
Our family is an embarrassment.

232
00:09:42,414 --> 00:09:44,341
That's not much of a joke.

233
00:09:44,342 --> 00:09:44,996
Okay.

234
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,368
Listen, Mom, I know you're
nervous, but I promise you,

235
00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:49,703
no one is gonna judge you
or this family.

236
00:09:49,706 --> 00:09:51,205
Oh, I'm sorry.

237
00:09:51,206 --> 00:09:52,539
It's just we're meeting
Leonard's parents

238
00:09:52,542 --> 00:09:53,874
for the first time,

239
00:09:53,875 --> 00:09:57,043
and-and they're academics
and-and intellectuals,

240
00:09:57,046 --> 00:09:59,429
and I don't want them thinking
we're white trash.

241
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:03,850
Well, what color trash
do you think they'll believe?

242
00:10:06,389 --> 00:10:08,221
How could you think
that I would spend the night

243
00:10:08,224 --> 00:10:09,639
with a man I just met?

244
00:10:09,642 --> 00:10:13,059
A man named Jesus convinced you
to build a church in Africa.

245
00:10:13,062 --> 00:10:15,395
You're kind of a sucker.

246
00:10:15,398 --> 00:10:18,732
Well, nothing happened, right?

247
00:10:18,735 --> 00:10:19,616
I-It's over.

248
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:20,900
Until we get married
a third time,

249
00:10:20,903 --> 00:10:23,821
you guys will never have
to see each other again.

250
00:10:23,822 --> 00:10:25,706
Well, you know, actually
that's not the case.

251
00:10:25,707 --> 00:10:27,991
- Mary may visit me in New York.
- Mm-hmm.

252
00:10:27,994 --> 00:10:30,161
And he's never been to Texas.

253
00:10:30,163 --> 00:10:31,461
Maybe we meet halfway.

254
00:10:31,463 --> 00:10:36,167
What? In the Chattahoochee
National Forest in Georgia?

255
00:10:36,168 --> 00:10:41,138
I can't be the only one
that knows that's halfway.

256
00:10:41,139 --> 00:10:43,347
You're not seriously going
to visit each other.

257
00:10:43,371 --> 00:10:44,393
And why wouldn't we?

258
00:10:44,417 --> 00:10:46,480
Oh please, you're just saying
this to antagonize me.

259
00:10:46,774 --> 00:10:49,596
Oh, not at all. Mary happens
to be a wonderful woman.

260
00:10:49,599 --> 00:10:51,899
And if it antagonizes you,
that's just a bonus.

261
00:10:54,102 --> 00:10:56,320
Mary, I'm sorry you're
in the middle of this.

262
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:58,355
No, no, nothing to be
sorry about.

263
00:10:58,356 --> 00:11:00,607
I genuinely like your father.

264
00:11:00,610 --> 00:11:03,360
What? But he's a
mediocre academic.

265
00:11:03,361 --> 00:11:06,947
And according to Beverly,
his sexual prowess is subpar.

266
00:11:08,083 --> 00:11:11,368
He's basically Leonard
with a bigger prostate.

267
00:11:13,755 --> 00:11:16,974
Are you saying that my dad's
not good enough for your mom?

268
00:11:16,975 --> 00:11:19,293
Yes, while also getting in
a solid dig at you.

269
00:11:19,294 --> 00:11:20,878
Pretty efficient, huh?

270
00:11:22,130 --> 00:11:24,965
This is ridiculous.
I-I'm going across the hall.

271
00:11:24,966 --> 00:11:26,884
But why should you get to go
and leave me here

272
00:11:26,885 --> 00:11:27,884
with your bickering parents?

273
00:11:27,886 --> 00:11:29,135
Fine, then you go!

274
00:11:29,138 --> 00:11:31,272
Well, I don't want to stay
here with her. I'll go.

275
00:11:31,274 --> 00:11:32,188
I'll go with you.

276
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:33,441
That still leaves me
here with him.

277
00:11:33,442 --> 00:11:34,975
Hang on, hang on!

278
00:11:34,976 --> 00:11:36,476
We're smart, we can
figure this out.

279
00:11:36,479 --> 00:11:39,947
Okay, so: Mary and Beverly
can't be together.

280
00:11:39,948 --> 00:11:43,116
Uh, Alfred and Beverly
can't be together.

281
00:11:43,119 --> 00:11:45,619
Leonard and I can't be together.

282
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:48,371
Now, I could be with Alfred...

283
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:49,990
but I don't like his face.

284
00:11:51,576 --> 00:11:52,993
Oh, here! I've got it!

285
00:11:52,995 --> 00:11:54,662
Who's ready for a wedding?

286
00:11:54,663 --> 00:11:56,996
Great, now I have
to start all over.

287
00:12:05,207 --> 00:12:07,375
So how's the world
of pharmaceuticals treating you?

288
00:12:07,376 --> 00:12:09,043
Pretty good. I actually
just got assigned

289
00:12:09,044 --> 00:12:10,427
a much better territory.

290
00:12:10,429 --> 00:12:13,047
See what happens
when you work hard?

291
00:12:13,048 --> 00:12:16,433
Hey, she just sells drugs.
I had to make 'em.

292
00:12:17,352 --> 00:12:18,885
Okay, that's enough.

293
00:12:18,888 --> 00:12:21,639
No more drug talk
for the rest of this trip.

294
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:24,057
I'll drink to that.

295
00:12:24,059 --> 00:12:24,975
Haven't you had enough?

296
00:12:24,977 --> 00:12:26,644
Penny drinks
more than I do.

297
00:12:26,645 --> 00:12:29,113
Well, I learned
from the best.

298
00:12:29,115 --> 00:12:30,947
Aw!
Aw!

299
00:12:31,985 --> 00:12:33,317
Very nice, Wyatt.

300
00:12:33,318 --> 00:12:35,952
And you wonder why this one
turned out the way he did.

301
00:12:35,955 --> 00:12:38,288
You see what I've gotta
put up with!

302
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:40,290
What you've gotta put up with?

303
00:12:40,293 --> 00:12:41,993
Why did you have
to go to jail?

304
00:12:41,995 --> 00:12:45,212
It's called getting
caught, Mother!

305
00:12:45,215 --> 00:12:46,913
Hello!

306
00:12:46,915 --> 00:12:48,081
Hey, there he is!
Hey!

307
00:12:48,084 --> 00:12:51,001
Oh, Leonard! It's so
nice to see you again!

308
00:12:51,004 --> 00:12:52,086
Oh, you, too!

309
00:12:52,087 --> 00:12:54,554
Hey, everyone, this is
my mother, Beverly.

310
00:12:54,557 --> 00:12:55,673
- Hello.
- Hi.

311
00:12:55,674 --> 00:12:58,893
We are not white trash!

312
00:13:03,149 --> 00:13:05,566
Are you excited to see your son
walk down the aisle?

313
00:13:05,567 --> 00:13:06,683
Yes, I am.

314
00:13:06,686 --> 00:13:07,902
I'm just feeling
a little guilty

315
00:13:07,903 --> 00:13:09,687
about all the trouble
I've caused.

316
00:13:09,688 --> 00:13:11,355
Oh, so am I.

317
00:13:11,356 --> 00:13:14,859
You made God sad today, Mom.

318
00:13:21,835 --> 00:13:23,500
Sheldon, they haven't done
anything wrong.

319
00:13:23,503 --> 00:13:26,037
I think it's nice
they're hitting it off.

320
00:13:26,038 --> 00:13:27,705
Well, that's still no reason
to rush into anything.

321
00:13:27,706 --> 00:13:28,788
Look at us.

322
00:13:28,791 --> 00:13:30,508
We took things
remarkably slow.

323
00:13:30,509 --> 00:13:33,344
You and I, we didn't even
hold hands for two years.

324
00:13:34,514 --> 00:13:37,548
It was a lot hotter
than it sounds.

325
00:13:37,549 --> 00:13:38,850
You're a patient
young lady.

326
00:13:38,851 --> 00:13:39,884
Hey, hey!

327
00:13:39,885 --> 00:13:42,052
She's mine! Take a cold shower,
grandpa!

328
00:13:46,192 --> 00:13:48,442
Why wouldn't that colonel say
what the meeting's about?

329
00:13:48,443 --> 00:13:49,976
It has to be bad news.

330
00:13:49,979 --> 00:13:52,230
Calm down, okay?
Try not to think about it.

331
00:13:52,231 --> 00:13:54,782
That's really stupid advice.

332
00:13:54,783 --> 00:13:56,616
You know that hurts
my feelings.

333
00:13:57,452 --> 00:13:59,787
Calm down, try not
to think about it.

334
00:14:00,822 --> 00:14:02,373
Okay.

335
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:05,576
Why do I bother
talking to you?

336
00:14:05,577 --> 00:14:08,245
Oh, come on. What's the worst
that could come of this meeting?

337
00:14:08,248 --> 00:14:10,380
I don't know. They take
the invention away,

338
00:14:10,383 --> 00:14:11,548
and I get nothing?

339
00:14:11,551 --> 00:14:13,583
Okay, that's not so bad.

340
00:14:13,586 --> 00:14:14,835
You know what happened
to the scientists

341
00:14:14,836 --> 00:14:16,419
that worked
on the Manhattan Project?

342
00:14:16,422 --> 00:14:18,588
The government forced them
to move to the desert.

343
00:14:18,591 --> 00:14:21,759
They had to live in secret,
and when Oppenheimer objected

344
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:22,927
to what they made him do,

345
00:14:22,928 --> 00:14:24,928
they destroyed his reputation.

346
00:14:26,014 --> 00:14:29,149
What's the point of that story?

347
00:14:30,436 --> 00:14:31,936
I just read a book
about Oppenheimer,

348
00:14:31,937 --> 00:14:35,239
seemed like a chance
to show off.

349
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:39,493
There he is!

350
00:14:39,495 --> 00:14:41,662
There's my happy
Hebraic homeboy.

351
00:14:41,663 --> 00:14:43,163
Yeah, that's the smile
I'm gonna remember

352
00:14:43,165 --> 00:14:47,618
when you're living in the desert
and I'm living with your wife.

353
00:14:51,506 --> 00:14:53,506
So, what do you do for a living?

354
00:14:54,293 --> 00:14:56,460
Mommy, you want
to take this one?

355
00:14:57,379 --> 00:14:59,797
Um, Randall's
in between jobs.

356
00:14:59,798 --> 00:15:02,600
And court appearances.

357
00:15:03,469 --> 00:15:04,467
It's nice to meet the woman

358
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:06,687
who raised this fine young man.

359
00:15:06,688 --> 00:15:08,438
I'm looking forward
to meeting his father.

360
00:15:08,441 --> 00:15:10,890
Prepare to be disappointed.

361
00:15:11,778 --> 00:15:12,943
And he can't wait
to meet you, too.

362
00:15:12,946 --> 00:15:14,312
Can I get anyone a drink?

363
00:15:14,313 --> 00:15:15,730
Well, I could use
another beer.

364
00:15:15,731 --> 00:15:16,813
You're done.

365
00:15:19,118 --> 00:15:20,400
He's done.

366
00:15:21,903 --> 00:15:24,538
Hey! Is everyone getting
to know each other?

367
00:15:24,539 --> 00:15:26,072
Not at all!

368
00:15:36,885 --> 00:15:38,836
Nice to see you again,
Dr. Hofstadter.

369
00:15:38,837 --> 00:15:40,671
I'm, uh, Leonard's friend,
Stuart.

370
00:15:40,673 --> 00:15:43,006
Nice to see you, too.

371
00:15:43,009 --> 00:15:44,225
Hi, I'm Stuart.

372
00:15:44,226 --> 00:15:46,894
Ooh, I'm Alfred.
Leonard's father.

373
00:15:46,895 --> 00:15:50,514
Oh! Oh, hi. Uh, I'm sorry, did
you two want to sit together?

374
00:15:50,515 --> 00:15:52,482
No.
No.

375
00:15:53,686 --> 00:15:58,522
I was wondering why the
front row was available.

376
00:15:58,524 --> 00:16:00,691
Okay, I think
we're ready.

377
00:16:08,533 --> 00:16:10,750
Why do people
cry at weddings?

378
00:16:10,753 --> 00:16:13,921
They're practicing for
what's coming later.

379
00:16:18,543 --> 00:16:21,461
Thank you for cleaning yourself
up for your sister's wedding.

380
00:16:21,463 --> 00:16:24,798
Thank you for my new teeth.

381
00:16:28,804 --> 00:16:30,471
Welcome to the family,
Leonard.

382
00:16:30,472 --> 00:16:32,690
Don't lend your new
brother-in-law money.

383
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:40,648
We're here today
to celebrate love.

384
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:46,070
Sigh louder,
no one heard you.

385
00:16:48,073 --> 00:16:49,907
Really, I can move.

386
00:16:51,244 --> 00:16:53,126
Not just Leonard and
Penny's love, but the love

387
00:16:53,129 --> 00:16:55,413
we have for them,
as well as each other.

388
00:16:55,414 --> 00:16:59,750
Speaking of love, STDs among
the elderly are skyrocketing.

389
00:17:02,587 --> 00:17:04,755
Love is patient,
but it's not gonna put up

390
00:17:04,757 --> 00:17:07,424
with all the side chatter,
so let's knock it off!

391
00:17:09,095 --> 00:17:11,345
At least she's yelling at
someone else for a change.

392
00:17:11,346 --> 00:17:13,564
Howard!

393
00:17:17,436 --> 00:17:19,153
Okay, I understand everyone's
a little tense today,

394
00:17:19,154 --> 00:17:21,654
so I am just gonna get
to the important stuff.

395
00:17:21,656 --> 00:17:24,991
Leonard, standing here
with you in front

396
00:17:24,993 --> 00:17:28,913
of our family and friends is
bringing up a lot of feelings.

397
00:17:29,949 --> 00:17:33,000
Like what a good idea it was
to elope the first time.

398
00:17:34,871 --> 00:17:38,372
But also how incredibly
happy you make me.

399
00:17:39,709 --> 00:17:41,459
Thank you for marrying me.

400
00:17:41,461 --> 00:17:43,294
Hopefully for the last time.

401
00:17:46,265 --> 00:17:48,015
Penny...

402
00:17:48,017 --> 00:17:51,684
as a scientist, my job is to
figure out why things happen.

403
00:17:51,686 --> 00:17:54,888
But I don't think
I'll ever understand

404
00:17:54,891 --> 00:17:59,393
how someone like me could get
to be with someone like you.

405
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:03,480
You know... maybe... I don't
need to understand it,

406
00:18:03,482 --> 00:18:04,565
I just need to be grateful.

407
00:18:04,567 --> 00:18:05,732
I love you, Penny.

408
00:18:05,734 --> 00:18:07,535
Oh...

409
00:18:09,154 --> 00:18:12,123
Anybody have anything snarky
to say about that?

410
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,210
Didn't think so.

411
00:18:17,163 --> 00:18:18,796
I'd like to say something.

412
00:18:19,999 --> 00:18:22,633
Beverly, I know that
we don't bring out

413
00:18:22,634 --> 00:18:24,000
the best in each other.

414
00:18:24,002 --> 00:18:28,172
But something wonderful did
come from our relationship:

415
00:18:28,173 --> 00:18:29,472
that young man right there.

416
00:18:30,509 --> 00:18:32,343
I couldn't agree more.

417
00:18:34,646 --> 00:18:36,931
That's beautiful.

418
00:18:38,984 --> 00:18:42,102
Thank you.
All right, let's continue.

419
00:18:42,104 --> 00:18:45,021
Yeah, excuse me,
I need to say something

420
00:18:45,023 --> 00:18:48,025
to someone pretty special,
and...

421
00:18:48,027 --> 00:18:50,161
I just can't wait any longer.

422
00:18:50,163 --> 00:18:51,862
It's happening.

423
00:18:51,864 --> 00:18:53,830
Leonard...

424
00:18:57,537 --> 00:19:00,037
You and I have
our ups and downs.

425
00:19:00,038 --> 00:19:03,423
But I have always considered
you my family.

426
00:19:03,425 --> 00:19:07,344
Even before the recent threat
of our parents fornicating

427
00:19:07,346 --> 00:19:09,180
like wrinkly old rabbits.

428
00:19:13,853 --> 00:19:18,137
I don't always show it, but you
are of great importance to me.

429
00:19:19,442 --> 00:19:21,141
Both of you.

430
00:19:21,143 --> 00:19:22,726
Oh...

431
00:19:22,728 --> 00:19:24,278
Thank you.

432
00:19:24,279 --> 00:19:25,778
Okay.

433
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:30,201
I now pronounce you
husband and wife.

434
00:19:30,202 --> 00:19:32,702
And weird other husband who came
with the apartment.

435
00:19:44,481 --> 00:19:46,731
Thank you for taking us
to the airport.

436
00:19:46,733 --> 00:19:49,669
Hey, I'm just thrilled we're all
getting along for a minute.

437
00:19:49,671 --> 00:19:50,802
Yeah, me, too.

438
00:19:50,805 --> 00:19:53,455
Beverly, I'm sorry
if I upset you.

439
00:19:53,458 --> 00:19:55,106
Water under the bridge, Alfred.

440
00:19:56,443 --> 00:19:58,611
Leonard, why don't you get
into the carpool lane?

441
00:19:58,613 --> 00:20:00,528
Well, that's a solid line.
He can't cross it.

442
00:20:00,530 --> 00:20:01,864
That's okay.
I can make it over.

443
00:20:01,865 --> 00:20:03,249
No, no, let's plod along.

444
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:05,534
It'll make your father feel
more comfortable.

445
00:20:07,087 --> 00:20:09,038
What makes me comfortable
is knowing I don't have to

446
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:11,653
wake up tomorrow morning
and see your sour face.

447
00:20:13,685 --> 00:20:15,925
Do the world a favor, and
don't wake up tomorrow morning.

448
00:20:19,551 --> 00:20:21,241
That was almost a minute.

449
00:20:24,074 --> 00:20:26,415
There's a lot of traffic.
Are we gonna be okay?

450
00:20:26,585 --> 00:20:28,439
You'll be at the airport
an hour before your flight.

451
00:20:28,462 --> 00:20:29,300
Good.
Thank you.

452
00:20:29,325 --> 00:20:32,583
Plenty of time for you to meet
another geriatric boy toy.

453
00:20:34,929 --> 00:20:35,914
Hey.

454
00:20:35,939 --> 00:20:38,060
I will not have you
be disrespectful to me.

455
00:20:38,085 --> 00:20:39,153
Yes ma'am.

456
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:41,340
Sheldon, you're mother's
an attractive woman.

457
00:20:41,544 --> 00:20:42,840
You need to get use to the fact

458
00:20:42,915 --> 00:20:44,567
that men are going
to be interest in her.

459
00:20:44,592 --> 00:20:47,220
Well.. and you need to drive
the car and mind your business.

460
00:20:48,702 --> 00:20:50,840
I will not have you
be disrespectful to me.

461
00:20:50,865 --> 00:20:51,894
What— you're not
my mother.

462
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:53,497
Don't you be disrespectful
to her.

463
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:54,520
Yes ma'am.

464
00:20:56,153 --> 00:20:57,037
You'll get there.

465
00:20:57,060 --> 00:20:59,203
You've just gotta put
some zing on it.

466
00:21:03,323 --> 00:21:05,638
Penny, I don't know what
I was worried about.

467
00:21:05,865 --> 00:21:07,310
You're friends are
just lovely.

468
00:21:07,335 --> 00:21:08,882
Oh, thanks, Mom.

469
00:21:09,053 --> 00:21:11,641
Although that Sheldon
is a bit peculiar.

470
00:21:13,394 --> 00:21:15,526
Is he?
I never noticed.

471
00:21:16,681 --> 00:21:18,755
He reminds me
of that turkey we had

472
00:21:18,757 --> 00:21:20,816
who drowned looking up
at the rain.

473
00:21:23,926 --> 00:21:26,070
Cops, cops, be cool!
