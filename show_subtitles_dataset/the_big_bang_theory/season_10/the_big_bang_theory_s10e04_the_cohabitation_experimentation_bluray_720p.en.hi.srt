1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:01,967
It was such a mess.

2
00:00:02,035 --> 00:00:03,988
That stinks. How long are you
out of the apartment?

3
00:00:03,989 --> 00:00:04,989
About five weeks.

4
00:00:05,057 --> 00:00:06,301
Ugh! Did you lose
anything valuable?

5
00:00:06,325 --> 00:00:07,792
Well, the pipe was
over my closet,

6
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:09,260
so all my
clothes are gone.

7
00:00:09,328 --> 00:00:11,763
Oh, so nothing. Great.

8
00:00:12,534 --> 00:00:14,239
Do they know why
the pipe burst?

9
00:00:14,305 --> 00:00:15,505
They didn't say.

10
00:00:15,573 --> 00:00:17,007
Buildings
that have a combination

11
00:00:17,074 --> 00:00:18,275
of copper and galvanized steel

12
00:00:18,342 --> 00:00:21,006
are susceptible to
pinholes and corrosion

13
00:00:21,106 --> 00:00:23,441
caused by the mobility
of ions in the water.

14
00:00:27,337 --> 00:00:30,206
Can't have your head shoved
in a toilet as much as I did

15
00:00:30,207 --> 00:00:34,010
and not pick up a few things
about plumbing.

16
00:00:34,078 --> 00:00:37,280
Well, if you need a place to
crash, you can stay with us.

17
00:00:37,348 --> 00:00:38,815
- Really?
- Of course.

18
00:00:38,883 --> 00:00:41,751
You can stay in Leonard's room,
and we'll stay at my place.

19
00:00:41,819 --> 00:00:43,419
You're sure
that's not an inconvenience?

20
00:00:43,487 --> 00:00:44,754
No, not at all.

21
00:00:44,822 --> 00:00:46,122
And we live with Sheldon,

22
00:00:46,190 --> 00:00:48,491
so the word "inconvenience"
has really lost all meaning.

23
00:00:49,927 --> 00:00:53,463
So, technically, I'd be
moving in with my boyfriend?

24
00:00:53,531 --> 00:00:54,998
I guess so.

25
00:00:55,065 --> 00:00:57,514
I'd finally get to live
alone with my husband.

26
00:00:57,991 --> 00:01:00,153
Oh, my, this is
a big step.

27
00:01:00,154 --> 00:01:00,901
Mm-hmm.

28
00:01:00,902 --> 00:01:02,903
For two of us, it's in
the right direction.

29
00:01:08,075 --> 00:01:11,944

The Cohabitation Experimentation
Original

39
00:01:34,756 --> 00:01:41,056
== sync, corrected by elderman ==
@elder_man

40
00:01:41,158 --> 00:01:43,326
Cohabitation
with my girlfriend?

41
00:01:43,394 --> 00:01:45,127
That's a great deal
to process.

42
00:01:45,151 --> 00:01:45,595
Mm.

43
00:01:45,596 --> 00:01:46,930
It's only for five weeks.

44
00:01:46,997 --> 00:01:48,932
Yeah, and we'll be
right across the hall.

45
00:01:48,999 --> 00:01:50,200
What do you think?

46
00:01:50,267 --> 00:01:51,701
I don't know.

47
00:01:51,769 --> 00:01:55,205
What if living together
kills the romance?

48
00:01:56,807 --> 00:01:59,542
Okay, you guys had sex
one whole time.

49
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:01,911
Nothing can put out
a fire like that.

50
00:02:01,979 --> 00:02:04,147
Yeah, but what happens

51
00:02:04,215 --> 00:02:06,316
when we each get a peek
behind the curtain?

52
00:02:06,383 --> 00:02:09,152
I mean, she's never even
seen me unshaven.

53
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:11,020
You just shaved yesterday.

54
00:02:11,088 --> 00:02:12,522
You're good for three months.

55
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:15,191
Sheldon, I understand
your apprehension,

56
00:02:15,259 --> 00:02:17,360
but let me appeal
to the scientist in you.

57
00:02:17,428 --> 00:02:19,429
Given the five-week end date,

58
00:02:19,497 --> 00:02:22,465
isn't it the perfect opportunity
to consider this an experiment

59
00:02:22,533 --> 00:02:24,501
and collect data
on our compatibility?

60
00:02:24,568 --> 00:02:27,804
Don't try luring me in
with sexy talk.

61
00:02:27,872 --> 00:02:29,272
Okay.

62
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:30,773
The Original Series.

63
00:02:30,841 --> 00:02:32,442
The Enterprise was
on a five-year mission

64
00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:33,643
to explore new worlds.

65
00:02:33,711 --> 00:02:34,811
Think of this
as your

66
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:37,180
personal five-week mission
to do the same.

67
00:02:37,248 --> 00:02:41,518
If you want to lure me in with
sexy talk, that's how you do it.

68
00:02:42,987 --> 00:02:45,188
Don't be proud of that.

69
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:48,191
So, is that a yes?

70
00:02:48,259 --> 00:02:49,526
Not yet. I...

71
00:02:49,593 --> 00:02:52,629
How will I learn if
I'm comfortable living with Amy

72
00:02:52,696 --> 00:02:54,864
or just comfortable because
I'm in my own apartment?

73
00:02:54,932 --> 00:02:57,267
Now, if this experiment
is going to be valid,

74
00:02:57,334 --> 00:02:59,135
I suggest a neutral environment.

75
00:02:59,203 --> 00:03:00,470
Well, where would you go?

76
00:03:00,538 --> 00:03:01,838
Well, ideally, an enclosed,

77
00:03:01,906 --> 00:03:05,808
self-sustaining biodome
in New Mexico.

78
00:03:05,876 --> 00:03:10,213
Where we would eat crops
fertilized with our own waste.

79
00:03:10,281 --> 00:03:13,449
And you were worried
about the romance.

80
00:03:13,517 --> 00:03:14,984
Wait.

81
00:03:15,052 --> 00:03:17,987
Why don't you guys stay across
the hall, and we will live here?

82
00:03:18,055 --> 00:03:19,722
Interesting.

83
00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:22,191
If my official residence
were across the hall,

84
00:03:22,259 --> 00:03:26,429
I wonder if I'd need to knock
every time I came over here.

85
00:03:26,497 --> 00:03:28,097
That's a good question.

86
00:03:28,165 --> 00:03:30,233
Maybe just don't come over.

87
00:03:32,469 --> 00:03:35,305
Historically, I don't
do well with change.

88
00:03:35,372 --> 00:03:36,606
Okay, it won't
be that bad.

89
00:03:36,674 --> 00:03:38,184
We wouldn't even sit in
your spot while you're gone.

90
00:03:38,208 --> 00:03:39,776
You're darn right, you wouldn't.

91
00:03:39,843 --> 00:03:42,178
No matter where I am,
this will always be my spot.

92
00:03:42,246 --> 00:03:43,313
Like an embassy

93
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:44,581
in a foreign country,

94
00:03:44,648 --> 00:03:47,717
this seat is the sovereign
soil of my bottom.

95
00:03:47,785 --> 00:03:50,787
Just nod and smile.
He's almost gone.

96
00:03:52,456 --> 00:03:54,891
Sheldon, what do you think?

97
00:03:57,528 --> 00:03:59,062
Very well. I'm on board.

98
00:03:59,129 --> 00:04:00,496
- Seriously?
- Yes.

99
00:04:00,564 --> 00:04:01,931
I accept this
five-week mission

100
00:04:01,999 --> 00:04:04,067
to share a living space
with my girlfriend.

101
00:04:04,134 --> 00:04:05,535
Oh. This is so exciting.

102
00:04:05,603 --> 00:04:07,770
Well, now, don't be surprised
if, like Star Trek,

103
00:04:07,838 --> 00:04:10,673
it's canceled in three.

104
00:04:11,842 --> 00:04:15,511
I have to say, I am happy
with your ob-gyn.

105
00:04:16,847 --> 00:04:19,949
Cool. 'Cause she says
you're doing a great job as

106
00:04:20,017 --> 00:04:23,086
"weird friend who doesn't have
to be at every appointment."

107
00:04:23,153 --> 00:04:25,588
I'm the son of a gynecologist.
I could be helpful.

108
00:04:25,656 --> 00:04:26,889
It would help

109
00:04:26,957 --> 00:04:30,693
if you stopped telling me
I have a textbook cervix.

110
00:04:30,761 --> 00:04:33,763
The polite response is,
"Thank you for noticing."

111
00:04:37,001 --> 00:04:39,202
Let me see the sonogram again.

112
00:04:40,604 --> 00:04:43,606
Oh, yeah, that's a good-looking
baby for a little gray blob.

113
00:04:43,674 --> 00:04:46,342
Yeah, we could
name him Blobert.

114
00:04:46,410 --> 00:04:48,011
What if it's a girl?

115
00:04:48,078 --> 00:04:49,812
Bloberta.

116
00:04:51,115 --> 00:04:52,548
Or Blobbi with an "I."

117
00:04:52,616 --> 00:04:56,185
Are we being silly
not finding out the sex?

118
00:04:56,253 --> 00:04:58,688
Yeah, I was just
thinking the same thing.

119
00:04:58,756 --> 00:05:00,623
If you want,
you can find out right now.

120
00:05:00,691 --> 00:05:02,025
- Mm.
- Hmm.

121
00:05:02,092 --> 00:05:04,132
The doctor's gone for the
day, so it doesn't matter.

122
00:05:04,161 --> 00:05:05,294
Well, somebody else knows

123
00:05:05,362 --> 00:05:07,063
because they saw it
in the folder.

124
00:05:07,131 --> 00:05:09,098
You looked in
our folder?

125
00:05:09,166 --> 00:05:10,233
It was an accident.

126
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:12,301
The doctor left
the folder out on her desk.

127
00:05:12,369 --> 00:05:15,505
It's not my fault
I opened it and looked.

128
00:05:15,572 --> 00:05:19,208
So you know the sex
of our baby, and we don't?

129
00:05:19,276 --> 00:05:22,211
Flip a coin.
You got a fifty-fifty shot.

130
00:05:22,279 --> 00:05:24,213
It's unbelievable.

131
00:05:24,281 --> 00:05:25,548
- God, Raj.
- What?

132
00:05:25,616 --> 00:05:27,050
This is not a problem, okay?

133
00:05:27,117 --> 00:05:29,252
If you don't want to know,
I don't have to tell you.

134
00:05:29,319 --> 00:05:31,287
We don't want you to know!

135
00:05:31,355 --> 00:05:33,823
Okay, well, that's a problem.

136
00:05:36,527 --> 00:05:39,762
You know, I'm very proud of you
for trying to live with Amy.

137
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:40,997
- Oh. Thank you.
- Mm.

138
00:05:41,065 --> 00:05:43,132
Of course, the ideal way
to conduct this experiment

139
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:46,602
would be with four pairs of
identical Sheldons and Amys.

140
00:05:46,670 --> 00:05:49,305
One pair that was neither
dating nor living together.

141
00:05:49,373 --> 00:05:51,507
One pair that was dating
but not living together.

142
00:05:51,575 --> 00:05:53,219
One pair that was living
together but not dating.

143
00:05:53,243 --> 00:05:54,363
And then, of
course, one pair

144
00:05:54,411 --> 00:05:56,312
that was living
together and dating.

145
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:57,714
Although, with
that many Sheldons,

146
00:05:57,781 --> 00:06:00,349
it'd be such a party,
we'd never get anything done.

147
00:06:00,417 --> 00:06:02,752
That was a cute story.

148
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:04,620
So, um...

149
00:06:06,256 --> 00:06:07,557
What did you want to ask me?

150
00:06:07,624 --> 00:06:10,793
Well, you've lived with your
significant other for some time.

151
00:06:10,861 --> 00:06:12,829
I would like this
experiment to go well.

152
00:06:12,896 --> 00:06:15,565
Are there any insights
you can share?

153
00:06:15,632 --> 00:06:19,035
Mm. Well, the biggie is,
if she has an insane roommate,

154
00:06:19,103 --> 00:06:20,903
kick him out
as soon as possible.

155
00:06:20,971 --> 00:06:23,873
You know, Leonard
and I were very happy

156
00:06:23,941 --> 00:06:25,675
before you came along.

157
00:06:27,277 --> 00:06:29,112
You've been roommates
with Sheldon forever.

158
00:06:29,179 --> 00:06:31,247
Do you have any advice?

159
00:06:31,315 --> 00:06:33,449
I'm trying to think of an answer

160
00:06:33,517 --> 00:06:35,685
that won't stop you
from doing this.

161
00:06:37,154 --> 00:06:38,454
I know it sounds
like a cliché,

162
00:06:38,522 --> 00:06:39,689
but compromise is key.

163
00:06:39,757 --> 00:06:41,491
Never leave a belt
on the floor.

164
00:06:41,558 --> 00:06:44,393
At night, they
look like snakes.

165
00:06:44,461 --> 00:06:46,963
Do little things, like bring her
a cup of coffee in bed.

166
00:06:47,030 --> 00:06:48,464
Keep M&M'S in your pocket

167
00:06:48,532 --> 00:06:50,533
in case you have to
wait in a long line.

168
00:06:51,802 --> 00:06:53,636
You're gonna be seeing
each other a lot,

169
00:06:53,704 --> 00:06:55,772
so respect each other's
personal space.

170
00:06:55,839 --> 00:07:00,443
He startles easily, so,
please, no flash photography.

171
00:07:03,313 --> 00:07:06,949
How many pairs of underwear
did you pack for the move?

172
00:07:07,017 --> 00:07:09,352
I don't know. I didn't count.

173
00:07:09,419 --> 00:07:12,855
You truly are the Goofus
to my Gallant.

174
00:07:14,324 --> 00:07:16,292
That's me. Listen,

175
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:20,663
you and I are gonna
be sharing a bed.

176
00:07:20,731 --> 00:07:23,966
You know, this is uncharted
territory for both of us.

177
00:07:24,034 --> 00:07:25,334
How are you feeling about that?

178
00:07:25,402 --> 00:07:28,805
Oh, excited, concerned,

179
00:07:28,872 --> 00:07:29,872
a little scared.

180
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:31,140
All the same emotions

181
00:07:31,208 --> 00:07:33,376
I feel
in line at Space Mountain.

182
00:07:35,779 --> 00:07:38,147
Well, if you're nervous
about the sleeping arrangements,

183
00:07:38,215 --> 00:07:39,882
maybe we should talk about it.

184
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:41,884
Okay.

185
00:07:44,655 --> 00:07:46,656
Talk.

186
00:07:46,723 --> 00:07:50,026
Well, I imagine
one of your concerns

187
00:07:50,093 --> 00:07:51,828
might be coital
expectations.

188
00:07:51,895 --> 00:07:54,730
Wow, no foreplay or anything,
just right to it.

189
00:07:56,099 --> 00:07:57,834
Look, I know
this experiment

190
00:07:57,901 --> 00:08:00,236
is a big step outside
of your comfort zone.

191
00:08:00,304 --> 00:08:03,706
So why don't we take being
physical off the table

192
00:08:03,774 --> 00:08:05,408
and maybe later on,

193
00:08:05,475 --> 00:08:08,377
once we're more settled in,
we can revisit it.

194
00:08:08,445 --> 00:08:11,214
You're really okay with that?

195
00:08:11,281 --> 00:08:12,849
I've never lived
with someone, either.

196
00:08:12,916 --> 00:08:14,684
This is a lot for me, too.

197
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:17,420
This is such a relief.

198
00:08:17,487 --> 00:08:19,989
Honestly, if it didn't
get you all worked up,

199
00:08:20,057 --> 00:08:22,725
I'd kiss you right now.

200
00:08:22,793 --> 00:08:24,660
Good call.

201
00:08:24,728 --> 00:08:26,495
Seeing your
Teen Titans underwear

202
00:08:26,563 --> 00:08:28,831
really got my
motor running.

203
00:08:28,899 --> 00:08:31,801
I know. They probably shouldn't
sell those to children.

204
00:08:35,472 --> 00:08:36,939
Well, here's your key.

205
00:08:37,007 --> 00:08:38,307
Thank you.

206
00:08:38,375 --> 00:08:39,942
Enjoy having the place
to yourselves.

207
00:08:40,010 --> 00:08:43,646
You enjoy your mission to boldly
go where no man has gone before.

208
00:08:46,083 --> 00:08:47,583
It's Penny's bedroom.

209
00:08:47,651 --> 00:08:49,518
Plenty of men have gone before.

210
00:08:52,589 --> 00:08:56,025
Now, now, there's no need
to make this emotional.

211
00:08:56,093 --> 00:08:58,928
Shall we?

212
00:08:58,996 --> 00:09:01,063
I guess this is it.

213
00:09:01,131 --> 00:09:01,931
You guys have fun.

214
00:09:01,999 --> 00:09:04,433
You, too.

215
00:09:05,302 --> 00:09:07,370
Oh, don't forget.

216
00:09:07,437 --> 00:09:09,872
Tuesday the air filters
need to be changed.

217
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:11,607
Yeah, you wrote it on my hand.

218
00:09:11,675 --> 00:09:12,775
Oh.

219
00:09:14,344 --> 00:09:15,645
Oh, and every other day,

220
00:09:15,712 --> 00:09:18,080
check the water level
on the avocado pit.

221
00:09:18,148 --> 00:09:19,315
I'm on it.

222
00:09:19,383 --> 00:09:22,318
15 years from now, we'll
make guacamole together.

223
00:09:22,386 --> 00:09:24,387
Leonard, please, let me go.

224
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,694
Come on, Sheldon.

225
00:09:31,762 --> 00:09:33,396
Oh. Bye.

226
00:09:33,463 --> 00:09:35,698
- Good night.
- Good night.

227
00:09:39,636 --> 00:09:41,170
Well, that's it.

228
00:09:41,238 --> 00:09:44,006
For the next five weeks, we are
officially living together.

229
00:09:44,074 --> 00:09:46,509
I guess the experiment begins.

230
00:09:46,576 --> 00:09:47,843
We did it!

231
00:09:47,911 --> 00:09:49,812
Yeah!

232
00:09:58,910 --> 00:10:01,111
Which side of the bed
would you prefer?

233
00:10:01,179 --> 00:10:02,780
Doesn't matter to me.
Your choice.

234
00:10:02,847 --> 00:10:05,783
No, no, we're living together
now... everything's equal.

235
00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:08,218
You know? I know that I have
a tendency to be controlling,

236
00:10:08,286 --> 00:10:09,687
so I would rather
you choose.

237
00:10:09,754 --> 00:10:11,299
Well, Sheldon,
I really appreciate that,

238
00:10:11,323 --> 00:10:13,657
but these things mean more
to you than they do to me,

239
00:10:13,725 --> 00:10:14,959
so whatever you want.

240
00:10:15,026 --> 00:10:16,470
Well, clearly,
it's not whatever I want,

241
00:10:16,494 --> 00:10:18,996
because what I want is for you
to make this decision,

242
00:10:19,064 --> 00:10:20,731
and you refuse to do that.

243
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:22,132
Well, I'm not refusing.

244
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,968
I'm just trying
to be considerate.

245
00:10:24,035 --> 00:10:25,869
Like when you
let me get those shoes

246
00:10:25,937 --> 00:10:27,271
with the wheels on the bottom,

247
00:10:27,339 --> 00:10:29,016
and then watched me roll
right into traffic?

248
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,368
Sheldon, will you please
just pick a side?

249
00:10:30,392 --> 00:10:31,460
Fine.

250
00:10:37,983 --> 00:10:40,284
Okay. Now, on this side,

251
00:10:40,352 --> 00:10:44,188
I am closer to the exit
in case of emergency.

252
00:10:44,255 --> 00:10:46,357
Great. That's your side.

253
00:10:46,424 --> 00:10:50,527
No, but I'm also closer to
the entrance in case of attack.

254
00:10:50,595 --> 00:10:53,163
Okay, I'll take that side.

255
00:10:53,231 --> 00:10:54,909
Ah, then again, what are
the odds of someone attacking me?

256
00:10:54,933 --> 00:10:56,400
Rising rapidly.

257
00:10:59,304 --> 00:11:02,973
Now, this side offers me
proximity to the bathroom,

258
00:11:03,041 --> 00:11:05,075
but I am closer to the window

259
00:11:05,143 --> 00:11:07,711
where perverts
can watch me sleep.

260
00:11:07,779 --> 00:11:09,680
Okay.

261
00:11:09,748 --> 00:11:12,349
What if we do this?

262
00:11:14,853 --> 00:11:15,853
I suppose that works.

263
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,021
Great.

264
00:11:20,759 --> 00:11:22,259
Although now I'm kind of worried

265
00:11:22,327 --> 00:11:24,194
someone's hiding
behind those drapes.

266
00:11:27,966 --> 00:11:29,733
This is ridiculous.

267
00:11:29,801 --> 00:11:33,037
The doctor knows what the baby
is, the ultrasound tech knows,

268
00:11:33,104 --> 00:11:34,505
Raj knows,

269
00:11:34,572 --> 00:11:38,208
his Grey's Anatomy online
fan group probably knows.

270
00:11:39,411 --> 00:11:41,145
Is it weird we don't?

271
00:11:41,212 --> 00:11:42,513
I don't know.

272
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:45,215
Maybe the surprise
will make it more fun.

273
00:11:45,283 --> 00:11:46,884
Like magic tricks.

274
00:11:46,951 --> 00:11:48,686
Remember how disappointed
you were

275
00:11:48,753 --> 00:11:51,321
when I explained
the never-ending hanky?

276
00:11:51,389 --> 00:11:53,557
I was disappointed to see
the man I was engaged to

277
00:11:53,625 --> 00:11:56,694
pulling rainbow scarves
out of his fly.

278
00:11:58,196 --> 00:12:01,398
But how delightful
was it when I pulled out

279
00:12:01,466 --> 00:12:03,967
a bouquet
at the end of those scarves?

280
00:12:04,035 --> 00:12:06,303
It'll be the same thing

281
00:12:06,371 --> 00:12:10,174
when the doctor pulls
a beautiful surprise out of you.

282
00:12:11,443 --> 00:12:14,645
Everyone said I could do better.

283
00:12:14,713 --> 00:12:17,815
But you didn't listen,
and presto change-o,

284
00:12:17,882 --> 00:12:20,184
my baby's inside you. Ta-da!

285
00:12:30,495 --> 00:12:32,162
Ugh. What is that?

286
00:12:41,339 --> 00:12:42,573
Why'd you switch sides?

287
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:44,742
Be grateful
I'm still in the room.

288
00:12:51,649 --> 00:12:52,983
Comfy?

289
00:12:53,051 --> 00:12:54,952
Oh, I'm just happy
I don't know

290
00:12:55,019 --> 00:12:57,421
what this memory
foam remembers.

291
00:12:57,489 --> 00:12:58,856
Sheldon?

292
00:12:58,923 --> 00:13:01,391
I know we took coitus
off the table,

293
00:13:01,459 --> 00:13:04,661
but I was wondering how you feel
about other forms of intimacy,

294
00:13:04,729 --> 00:13:05,996
such as snuggling.

295
00:13:06,064 --> 00:13:07,731
Well, it's funny
you should ask,

296
00:13:07,799 --> 00:13:10,234
because I was wondering
how you'd feel

297
00:13:10,301 --> 00:13:14,037
about separating the two
of us with a pillow wall.

298
00:13:15,473 --> 00:13:18,742
Sheldon, I've made more than
enough accommodations for you.

299
00:13:18,810 --> 00:13:20,844
We're both grown adults...

300
00:13:20,912 --> 00:13:22,432
we've been far more
intimate than this.

301
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,214
If you don't want
to snuggle, fine...

302
00:13:24,282 --> 00:13:25,983
but we're not building
a pillow wall.

303
00:13:26,050 --> 00:13:27,251
Okay, well, I am sorry.

304
00:13:27,318 --> 00:13:29,386
I'm just worried that my
sensitivity to temperature

305
00:13:29,454 --> 00:13:31,455
could make this
a rough night.

306
00:13:31,523 --> 00:13:33,657
And no offense, but your
bottom radiates enough heat,

307
00:13:33,725 --> 00:13:36,026
I'm surprised there aren't
iguanas lying on it.

308
00:13:40,598 --> 00:13:42,733
That's it. It's
Sheldon's bedtime.

309
00:13:42,801 --> 00:13:44,268
He is in for the night.

310
00:13:44,335 --> 00:13:47,805
Wow. I cannot believe we are
alone in our own apartment.

311
00:13:47,872 --> 00:13:49,139
It's weird.

312
00:13:49,207 --> 00:13:50,367
This must be how parents feel

313
00:13:50,408 --> 00:13:53,644
when their kid goes off
to college.

314
00:13:53,711 --> 00:13:57,748
Unless they feel sad...
then it's different.

315
00:13:57,816 --> 00:13:58,949
So, what do you want to do?

316
00:13:59,017 --> 00:14:02,686
I know exactly what
we are gonna do.

317
00:14:02,754 --> 00:14:03,887
Really? You're a genius,

318
00:14:03,955 --> 00:14:06,390
and that's the first thing
you come up with?

319
00:14:07,492 --> 00:14:09,226
Hey, Sheldon's
not here,

320
00:14:09,294 --> 00:14:11,295
so we are going
to put on music

321
00:14:11,362 --> 00:14:13,564
and dance in
our underwear.

322
00:14:14,833 --> 00:14:17,668
Ugh. Can we just have sex?

323
00:14:18,770 --> 00:14:20,337
Oh, don't worry.

324
00:14:20,405 --> 00:14:23,340

sex is inevitable.

00:15:40,818 --> 00:15:43,086
- Yes.
- Okay. Here we go.

352
00:15:43,154 --> 00:15:44,721
It's ringing.

353
00:15:48,126 --> 00:15:49,693
Hello?

354
00:15:49,761 --> 00:15:52,396
- Wait.
- Wrong number.

355
00:16:30,568 --> 00:16:33,837
I told you
not to do the worm.

356
00:16:33,905 --> 00:16:36,573
You were right.

357
00:16:40,979 --> 00:16:42,179
Hello.

358
00:16:42,246 --> 00:16:45,282
I changed my mind!
Hang up! Hang up!

359
00:16:53,825 --> 00:16:55,125
Oh.

360
00:17:01,566 --> 00:17:02,666
Oh.

361
00:17:07,005 --> 00:17:08,538
Oh, gee... oh!

362
00:17:13,011 --> 00:17:14,811
What are you doing down there?

363
00:17:14,879 --> 00:17:15,879
Hang on.

364
00:17:15,947 --> 00:17:17,014
Who are you calling?

365
00:17:30,521 --> 00:17:32,155
I'm so sore.
I don't think

366
00:17:32,223 --> 00:17:34,291
I slept two minutes last night.

367
00:17:40,064 --> 00:17:42,065
Yeah, get it, girl.

368
00:17:43,134 --> 00:17:45,969
It's not what you think.

369
00:17:46,037 --> 00:17:48,004
I feel like
I pulled something.

370
00:17:48,072 --> 00:17:50,173
Why didn't you tell me to stop?

371
00:17:51,375 --> 00:17:53,810
Even more not
what you think.

372
00:17:54,745 --> 00:17:56,580
I don't know
if I can make it

373
00:17:56,647 --> 00:17:58,415
through five weeks
living with him.

374
00:17:58,483 --> 00:18:00,698
If you ever need a break,
the owner of the train store

375
00:18:00,699 --> 00:18:02,378
will let you leave him there
while you get a coffee.

376
00:18:02,402 --> 00:18:03,863
Yeah.

377
00:18:04,922 --> 00:18:06,223
Good morning.

378
00:18:06,290 --> 00:18:08,391
See? I didn't knock,
but it's fine.

379
00:18:08,459 --> 00:18:11,361
I didn't knock, but it's fine.
I didn't knock, but it's fine.

380
00:18:11,429 --> 00:18:14,030
So, how is everyone?

381
00:18:14,098 --> 00:18:16,299
Miserable and exhausted.

382
00:18:16,367 --> 00:18:17,901
Really? I slept great.

383
00:18:17,969 --> 00:18:21,004
Well, I didn't,
and it's your fault.

384
00:18:21,072 --> 00:18:23,907
How? You had the whole floor
to yourself.

385
00:18:26,177 --> 00:18:29,546
Sheldon, maybe living together
is a bad idea.

386
00:18:29,614 --> 00:18:32,182
Well... Yeah, but what kind
of scientists would we be,

387
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:35,352
drawing a conclusion
after only 12 hours of data?

388
00:18:35,419 --> 00:18:38,788
The kind who almost put a pillow
over your face last night.

389
00:18:40,424 --> 00:18:41,725
Wow.

390
00:18:41,792 --> 00:18:43,693
I anticipated
we'd have problems,

391
00:18:43,761 --> 00:18:47,297
but I never thought your
scientific rigor would be one of them.

392
00:18:47,365 --> 00:18:50,867
I'm sorry, are you questioning
my integrity as a scientist?

393
00:18:50,935 --> 00:18:53,904
If the lab room
disposable shoe cover fits.

394
00:18:55,072 --> 00:18:56,740
Was that a science diss?

395
00:18:56,807 --> 00:18:57,974
- Yeah.
- Was it a good one?

396
00:18:58,042 --> 00:18:59,743
- Eh.
- Ah.

397
00:18:59,810 --> 00:19:01,344
What would a
theoretical physicist

398
00:19:01,412 --> 00:19:03,213
understand about an
experiment anyway?

399
00:19:03,281 --> 00:19:05,161
I mean, you wouldn't know
a confounding variable

400
00:19:05,216 --> 00:19:08,351
if two of them hit you in
the face at the same time!

401
00:19:09,921 --> 00:19:11,454
And you don't even
get that joke,

402
00:19:11,522 --> 00:19:14,758
'cause you don't even work
with confounding variables!

403
00:19:15,626 --> 00:19:17,260
How dare you?

404
00:19:17,328 --> 00:19:19,462
Oh, you heard me.
Your experimental bona fides

405
00:19:19,530 --> 00:19:20,764
are laughable.

406
00:19:20,831 --> 00:19:23,500
Whoa, whoa! Now you're
making fun of my bona fides?

407
00:19:23,568 --> 00:19:26,303
Can't make fun of something
that's a null set.

408
00:19:27,438 --> 00:19:28,939
I feel like

409
00:19:29,006 --> 00:19:30,407
I should say "damn."
- Do it.

410
00:19:30,474 --> 00:19:32,108
Damn!

411
00:19:32,176 --> 00:19:35,409
Well, if you are so protective
of the scientific method,

412
00:19:35,410 --> 00:19:37,136
perhaps we should use
the next five weeks

413
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:38,982
to finish what we started.

414
00:19:38,983 --> 00:19:40,984
Well, for science, maybe I will!

415
00:19:41,052 --> 00:19:42,552
For science, maybe you should!

416
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:43,320
- Fine!
- Fine!

417
00:19:43,387 --> 00:19:44,921
- Good.
- Great.

418
00:19:44,989 --> 00:19:47,057
Do you want to go to our place
and make out?

419
00:19:47,124 --> 00:19:48,925
Does Stephen Hawking roll
through the quad?

420
00:19:56,033 --> 00:19:58,735
The new neighbors
are weird.
