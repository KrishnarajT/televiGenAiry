1
00:00:01,937 --> 00:00:03,136
on the cooling system?

2
00:00:03,138 --> 00:00:04,404
Sure, I'm still figuring out

3
00:00:04,406 --> 00:00:05,605
the thermo-acoustic expander.

4
00:00:05,607 --> 00:00:06,706
Oh, while you do that

5
00:00:06,708 --> 00:00:10,043
I am going to pump
cerebral spinal fluid

6
00:00:10,045 --> 00:00:13,246
through my brain cells to remove
the metabolic by-products

7
00:00:13,248 --> 00:00:15,115
of the day's thoughts.

8
00:00:15,117 --> 00:00:17,150
What?

9
00:00:17,152 --> 00:00:18,718
It's called sleep
and it's my bedtime.

10
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:20,520
Nighty-night, y'all.

11
00:00:20,522 --> 00:00:22,823
Hey, hey, hey,
you're not going anywhere.

12
00:00:22,825 --> 00:00:25,058
We only have two months to
deliver this to the Air Force

13
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:26,093
because of you.

14
00:00:26,095 --> 00:00:28,862
I know, I was there.

15
00:00:28,864 --> 00:00:30,363
Well, wake up!

16
00:00:30,365 --> 00:00:32,466
We're gonna put in
a lot of late nights.

17
00:00:32,468 --> 00:00:33,800
How late?

18
00:00:33,802 --> 00:00:37,037
Well, I don't know,
midnight, 1:00.

19
00:00:37,039 --> 00:00:38,038
One o'clock?

20
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:40,307
I'm not a raccoon.

21
00:00:40,309 --> 00:00:43,477
If you're tired,
have some coffee.

22
00:00:43,479 --> 00:00:44,945
What?
You have some coffee.

23
00:00:44,947 --> 00:00:46,646
I am having coffee!

24
00:00:46,648 --> 00:00:48,381
And look how irritable
it's making you!

25
00:00:48,383 --> 00:00:50,417
Guys!

26
00:00:50,419 --> 00:00:52,285
We're not gonna get anything
done if we start fighting.

27
00:00:52,287 --> 00:00:54,454
Now, can you please try
to soldier through?

28
00:00:55,624 --> 00:00:57,157
Fine.

29
00:01:11,106 --> 00:01:14,040
I don't think
I can go much longer.

30
00:01:14,042 --> 00:01:16,109
It's been three and a half

41
00:01:46,406 --> 00:01:49,340
I had a bad dream that
my best friend became a tyrant

42
00:01:49,342 --> 00:01:51,676
and forced me to stay
up all night to work.

43
00:01:51,678 --> 00:01:53,945
Oh, I had a good dream that
when I carried you to bed,

44
00:01:53,947 --> 00:01:57,281
I let your head hit
the wall and I laughed.

45
00:01:57,283 --> 00:01:58,950
Good morning.

46
00:01:58,952 --> 00:02:00,018
What is this?

47
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:01,486
Well, we didn't see you
last night,

48
00:02:01,488 --> 00:02:02,720
we're not gonna see you today,

49
00:02:02,722 --> 00:02:05,089
so we thought we could have
breakfast together.

50
00:02:05,091 --> 00:02:06,090
Oh, that is so nice.

51
00:02:06,092 --> 00:02:09,427
Ow, it does hurt!

52
00:02:09,429 --> 00:02:11,763
So, what are you guys
gonna do today?

53
00:02:11,765 --> 00:02:12,764
Well, Sheldon was supposed to go

54
00:02:12,766 --> 00:02:14,465
to this party with me
this afternoon,

55
00:02:14,467 --> 00:02:15,667
but I don't think
that's happening.

56
00:02:15,669 --> 00:02:17,635
Oh, that was never happening.

57
00:02:17,637 --> 00:02:19,303
Oh, I'll go.

58
00:02:19,305 --> 00:02:21,072
I like a party.

59
00:02:21,074 --> 00:02:23,107
Well, to be honest, it's not
like a "party" party,

60
00:02:23,109 --> 00:02:24,776
it's more like a gathering

61
00:02:24,778 --> 00:02:26,377
where scientists of different
disciplines get together

62
00:02:26,379 --> 00:02:27,845
to share their work
and keep current

63
00:02:27,847 --> 00:02:29,247
on what's going on
in other fields.

64
00:02:29,249 --> 00:02:31,616
I don't know why
I called it a party, sorry.

65
00:02:31,618 --> 00:02:33,518
It's okay, I'll still go.

66
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,286
You don't think you'll be bored?

67
00:02:35,288 --> 00:02:37,155
Oh, I'll have some wine
and listen to people go on

68
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:38,389
about crap I don't understand.

69
00:02:38,391 --> 00:02:39,323
I mean, how is it any different

70
00:02:39,325 --> 00:02:41,993
than every
single day of my life?

71
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:44,162
I won't be there.

72
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:45,646
Look at that, it is a party.

73
00:02:45,647 --> 00:02:47,247
Oh.

74
00:02:48,568 --> 00:02:50,535
Sorry I have to work
all weekend.

75
00:02:50,537 --> 00:02:52,003
It's okay.

76
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:54,205
Thanks again for breakfast.

77
00:02:54,207 --> 00:02:55,540
Well, I didn't get to
see you last night.

78
00:02:55,542 --> 00:02:57,909
It was the least I could do.

79
00:02:57,911 --> 00:03:00,611
You shouldn't have made
the alarm code his birthday.

80
00:03:03,383 --> 00:03:05,850
So, what should we do today?

81
00:03:05,852 --> 00:03:07,285
Oh, I appreciate it,

82
00:03:07,287 --> 00:03:08,953
but you don't have to
spend your day off with me.

83
00:03:08,955 --> 00:03:10,388
Well, I don't mind.

84
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:12,690
Oh, you want go to the mall
and look at baby stuff?

85
00:03:12,692 --> 00:03:13,891
Not really.

86
00:03:13,893 --> 00:03:15,359
Oh, come on,
we could share a pretzel

87
00:03:15,361 --> 00:03:19,564
and get sideways glances
from racist old ladies.

88
00:03:19,566 --> 00:03:21,799
I get enough of that
when I take Howard

89
00:03:21,801 --> 00:03:23,668
to my grandmother's
for Christmas.

90
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:25,770
Oh,

91
00:03:25,772 --> 00:03:28,806
I know, why don't we get started
on clearing out the baby's room?

92
00:03:28,808 --> 00:03:30,208
Isn't it
a little early for that?

93
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:32,043
You have to
get to it eventually.

94
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:34,779
Oh, there's so much junk
in there, it's embarrassing.

95
00:03:34,781 --> 00:03:36,981
How can you be
embarrassed around me?

96
00:03:36,983 --> 00:03:39,217
I'm gonna be in the room
with you when you give birth.

97
00:03:46,259 --> 00:03:48,326
I don't think you are.

98
00:03:48,328 --> 00:03:50,661
You didn't think I was gonna be
in your kitchen this morning,

99
00:03:50,663 --> 00:03:53,131
yet here I am.

100
00:03:59,339 --> 00:04:01,205
Psst, hey, kid.

101
00:04:01,207 --> 00:04:02,406
Huh, what?

102
00:04:05,145 --> 00:04:06,944
You look tired.

103
00:04:06,946 --> 00:04:08,880
Why don't you have
an energy drink?

104
00:04:08,882 --> 00:04:10,915
Everyone's doing it.

105
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:15,153
Oh, no, thank you,
those have caffeine in them.

106
00:04:15,155 --> 00:04:16,387
Oh, sorry,

107
00:04:16,389 --> 00:04:18,322
I thought you were cool.

108
00:04:20,026 --> 00:04:21,392
I am cool.

109
00:04:21,394 --> 00:04:23,060
This is Yoo-hoo,

110
00:04:23,062 --> 00:04:25,897
chocolate milk's
delicious watery cousin.

111
00:04:25,899 --> 00:04:27,398
All right.

112
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:30,301
But if you ever want to feel
like you have superpowers,

113
00:04:30,303 --> 00:04:32,103
try one of these.

114
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:35,273
Superheroes take
performance-enhancing chemicals?

115
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:36,407
You bet.

116
00:04:36,409 --> 00:04:39,010
You know why Hulk
is so strong?

117
00:04:39,012 --> 00:04:40,511
Steroids.

118
00:04:41,815 --> 00:04:44,615
You know why Batman
wanders around at night

119
00:04:44,617 --> 00:04:46,818
getting into fights?

120
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:48,119
Scotch.

121
00:04:50,657 --> 00:04:53,591
I am facing
a great deal of work.

122
00:04:53,593 --> 00:04:57,895
And I do like things better when
famous people also like them.

123
00:04:57,897 --> 00:05:00,031
Here.

124
00:05:00,033 --> 00:05:01,165
It's on the house.

125
00:05:01,167 --> 00:05:05,136
The first one's free?

126
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:07,738
Flash, how do you
stay in business?

127
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:10,141
You want to know my secret?

128
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:12,777
I bought stock in Marvel.

129
00:05:15,415 --> 00:05:16,514
Hi, Bert.

130
00:05:16,516 --> 00:05:17,615
This is my friend, Penny.

131
00:05:17,617 --> 00:05:18,222
Hi.

132
00:05:18,247 --> 00:05:19,219
Hey, come on in.

133
00:05:19,219 --> 00:05:21,019
I'll gonna go turn on
some rock music.

134
00:05:21,921 --> 00:05:24,322
That's a geology joke.

135
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:25,756
Bert's a geologist.

136
00:05:25,758 --> 00:05:27,892
And a joker.

137
00:05:30,129 --> 00:05:31,896
How early are we?

138
00:05:31,898 --> 00:05:34,832
Oh, actually,
we're an hour late.

139
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:37,969
I suddenly wish
Sheldon was here.

140
00:05:42,408 --> 00:05:44,275
I don't even
know where to begin.

141
00:05:44,277 --> 00:05:47,211
Well, in The Sound of Music,
Julie Andrews says,

142
00:05:47,213 --> 00:05:48,779
"Let's start at
the very beginning.

143
00:05:48,781 --> 00:05:51,082
A very good place to start."

144
00:05:51,084 --> 00:05:53,851
Oh, I was gonna start
at the end.

145
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:55,353
Thank God you're here.

146
00:05:57,123 --> 00:06:00,925
Well, I think the first thing we
should get rid of is that tone.

147
00:06:00,927 --> 00:06:04,061
Sorry.

148
00:06:04,063 --> 00:06:05,396
I should probably keep this

149
00:06:05,398 --> 00:06:06,731
in case we have a girl.

150
00:06:06,733 --> 00:06:07,865
Oh, that's a nice one.

151
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:09,300
Was it yours when
you were little?

152
00:06:09,302 --> 00:06:10,701
My dad built it for me.

153
00:06:10,703 --> 00:06:12,203
Wow, it's so cute.

154
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:15,206
This was the husband
and this was the wife.

155
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:16,807
They'd go out on
adventures together.

156
00:06:16,809 --> 00:06:18,342
Cruises, skiing,

157
00:06:18,344 --> 00:06:19,577
horseback riding.

158
00:06:19,579 --> 00:06:23,281
That was really me just
duct taping them to our dog.

159
00:06:23,283 --> 00:06:24,849
Oh, and did they have kids?

160
00:06:24,851 --> 00:06:27,285
They did, but the mommy
and daddy didn't like them,

161
00:06:27,287 --> 00:06:28,686
so they shipped them off
to an orphanage

162
00:06:28,688 --> 00:06:31,088
I made out of a shoebox.

163
00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:34,959
Yeah, that's not worrisome
at all.

164
00:06:34,961 --> 00:06:38,362
Not every girl dreams
about being a mom.

165
00:06:38,364 --> 00:06:41,198
Sometimes you think
you're never gonna have kids

166
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:43,167
and one day you wake up
and you're pregnant.

167
00:06:43,169 --> 00:06:44,969
And it doesn't matter that your
career's going great right now

168
00:06:44,971 --> 00:06:47,071
and that you and your husband
never even got to go anywhere

169
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:50,174
taped to a dog!

170
00:06:50,176 --> 00:06:53,044
I skipped spin class for this.

171
00:06:56,049 --> 00:06:59,116
Why is it taking him so long

172
00:06:59,118 --> 00:07:01,152
to get a drink out
of a vending machine?

173
00:07:01,154 --> 00:07:02,887
Oh, it's complicated.

174
00:07:02,889 --> 00:07:04,288
He finds pushing
that little door

175
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:07,491
and reaching up into the machine
uncomfortably intimate.

176
00:07:09,495 --> 00:07:11,562
Gentlemen, I am ready to work.

177
00:07:11,564 --> 00:07:14,332
To quote The Martian, "Let's
science the feces out of this!"

178
00:07:14,334 --> 00:07:16,100
That's The Martian the book

179
00:07:16,102 --> 00:07:17,802
and The Martian the movie,
not Marvin the Martian.

180
00:07:17,804 --> 00:07:19,103
Although to quote
Marvin the Martian,

181
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:20,371
"I claim this planet

182
00:07:20,373 --> 00:07:21,772
in the name of Mars."

183
00:07:21,774 --> 00:07:24,709
Are you okay?

184
00:07:24,711 --> 00:07:26,377
Oh, I'm fantastic,
never been better.

185
00:07:26,379 --> 00:07:27,745
I had my first energy drink

186
00:07:27,747 --> 00:07:29,180
and I feel great.

187
00:07:29,182 --> 00:07:30,114
Hey, you guys want to wrestle?

188
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:31,849
We can do arm,
thumb, mud, sumo.

189
00:07:31,851 --> 00:07:34,418
Nah, we're not fat enough,
or wearing diapers.

190
00:07:37,423 --> 00:07:38,689
You wanted him awake.

191
00:07:50,813 --> 00:07:55,582
So should we talk
to each other or mingle?

192
00:07:55,584 --> 00:07:57,451
I don't know where everyone is.

193
00:07:57,453 --> 00:07:58,485
Yeah, I mean,

194
00:07:58,487 --> 00:08:00,754
I could see him eating
one or two guests,

195
00:08:00,756 --> 00:08:03,557
but not a whole party.

196
00:08:03,559 --> 00:08:05,792
Well, I guess this is
kind of a bust.

197
00:08:05,794 --> 00:08:07,527
You don't have to stay.

198
00:08:07,529 --> 00:08:09,763
I'm gonna start cleaning up.

199
00:08:09,765 --> 00:08:11,098
Okay.

200
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:13,166
I feel so bad about
leaving him here.

201
00:08:13,168 --> 00:08:16,803
Oh, it's funny, I was just thinking
the same thing about you.

202
00:08:16,805 --> 00:08:17,871
Hey, listen,

203
00:08:17,873 --> 00:08:20,173
could you not
say anything about this

204
00:08:20,175 --> 00:08:21,908
to the people at the university?

205
00:08:21,910 --> 00:08:23,644
You know, 'cause...

206
00:08:23,646 --> 00:08:26,813
you're you and I'm me,
and it's kind of embarrassing.

207
00:08:26,815 --> 00:08:29,116
Wait, what do you mean
"she's her"?

208
00:08:29,118 --> 00:08:32,019
Well, you know how Amy's the
coolest girl on campus, right?

209
00:08:32,021 --> 00:08:33,754
No.
No.

210
00:08:33,756 --> 00:08:35,822
Oh yeah, everybody thinks so.

211
00:08:35,824 --> 00:08:37,291
What?

212
00:08:37,293 --> 00:08:42,195
You tell me about your foot
fungus, but this is a secret?

213
00:08:42,197 --> 00:08:44,498
I'm sure it's just
'cause I'm dating Sheldon.

214
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:48,135
Mm, actually, I think Sheldon's
popular because he's dating you.

215
00:08:50,105 --> 00:08:51,872
Now Sheldon's popular?

216
00:08:51,874 --> 00:08:54,474
What is happening?

217
00:08:57,513 --> 00:08:59,279
Maybe we should break for lunch.

218
00:08:59,281 --> 00:09:00,280
What time is it?

219
00:09:03,952 --> 00:09:07,120
According to the world's worst
cuckoo clock, it's 2:00.

220
00:09:07,122 --> 00:09:09,489
My head hurts

221
00:09:09,491 --> 00:09:11,625
and I'm more tired than ever.

222
00:09:11,627 --> 00:09:13,060
Why don't you just go home?

223
00:09:13,062 --> 00:09:14,661
No, I can do this.

224
00:09:14,663 --> 00:09:18,231
I just, I just need
another energy drink.

225
00:09:18,233 --> 00:09:20,067
Oh, no.

226
00:09:20,069 --> 00:09:21,301
What?

227
00:09:21,303 --> 00:09:22,803
I want another one.

228
00:09:22,805 --> 00:09:23,804
So?

229
00:09:23,806 --> 00:09:25,572
That's a craving.

230
00:09:25,574 --> 00:09:28,608
That's a sign of
chemical dependency.

231
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:30,143
You only had one.

232
00:09:30,145 --> 00:09:31,278
No, I know,

233
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:32,546
but plenty of
things are addictive

234
00:09:32,548 --> 00:09:34,214
after a single exposure.

235
00:09:34,216 --> 00:09:38,218
I mean, crack cocaine,
nicotine, Pringles.

236
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:41,188
You know once one pops
one just can't stop.

237
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:43,757
You can't develop
a problem that fast.

238
00:09:43,759 --> 00:09:44,991
You want to bet?
Oh, great,

239
00:09:44,993 --> 00:09:46,326
now I'm addicted to gambling.

240
00:09:50,532 --> 00:09:53,834
We can't afford to lose
any more time.

241
00:09:53,836 --> 00:09:56,503
Well, this probably won't
work, but has anyone ever tried

242
00:09:56,505 --> 00:10:00,440
to just haul off and
whoop the crazy out of him?

243
00:10:00,442 --> 00:10:03,310
That's not helpful.

244
00:10:03,312 --> 00:10:05,912
It's fun to think about,
but it's not helpful.

245
00:10:07,116 --> 00:10:10,384
Hey, Sheldon, we are on
a serious time crunch.

246
00:10:10,386 --> 00:10:11,952
We can't do this
without you.

247
00:10:11,954 --> 00:10:13,453
Can you please
pull it together?

248
00:10:13,455 --> 00:10:15,522
I'm sorry.
Yes, of course.

249
00:10:15,524 --> 00:10:17,557
Thank you.

250
00:10:17,559 --> 00:10:20,694
Just, please, bear with me
if I display symptoms

251
00:10:20,696 --> 00:10:22,629
of caffeine withdrawal.

252
00:10:22,631 --> 00:10:24,931
No worries.

253
00:10:45,387 --> 00:10:47,721
You guys stink.

254
00:10:48,924 --> 00:10:50,891
Sorry I flipped out on you.

255
00:10:50,893 --> 00:10:52,592
I think it's just hormones.

256
00:10:52,594 --> 00:10:54,094
I think you were mean
before you were pregnant,

257
00:10:54,096 --> 00:10:55,228
but it's fine.

258
00:10:56,932 --> 00:10:59,800
So, uh, instead of
cleaning out the room,

259
00:10:59,802 --> 00:11:02,202
why don't we just decide
on a theme for the nursery?

260
00:11:02,204 --> 00:11:03,670
Does it really need one?

261
00:11:03,672 --> 00:11:05,238
Of course it does.

262
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:07,207
Didn't your baby room
have a theme?

263
00:11:07,209 --> 00:11:09,242
Well, it doubled
as my dad's office,

264
00:11:09,244 --> 00:11:11,111
and he was a cop,
so I guess the theme was

265
00:11:11,113 --> 00:11:13,647
bloody homicide photos.

266
00:11:13,649 --> 00:11:17,717
Oh. Mine was
Winnie the Pooh.

267
00:11:17,719 --> 00:11:20,654
But anyway...

268
00:11:20,656 --> 00:11:22,889
why don't we just
take a step back

269
00:11:22,891 --> 00:11:24,057
and start with a color?

270
00:11:24,059 --> 00:11:25,725
Right? There are
so many amazing ones.

271
00:11:25,727 --> 00:11:28,695
Red, blue, green, purple...

272
00:11:28,697 --> 00:11:30,330
Are you just gonna name
all the colors?

273
00:11:30,332 --> 00:11:33,500
Well, not now.

274
00:11:34,670 --> 00:11:36,736
I don't care what color
the room is.

275
00:11:36,738 --> 00:11:38,738
Okay, well, I'm just
trying to help you.

276
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:40,874
Well, you're not,
so just drop it!

277
00:11:44,213 --> 00:11:46,713
I'm clearly upset.
Why aren't you following me?

278
00:11:46,715 --> 00:11:49,916
Sorry! Sorry!

279
00:11:51,019 --> 00:11:53,820
And when Amy started using
a solution of chromic acid

280
00:11:53,822 --> 00:11:56,790
and white vinegar to clean
all her lab equipment,

281
00:11:56,792 --> 00:12:00,460
all of a sudden,
everybody was doing it.

282
00:12:01,597 --> 00:12:03,597
You trend setter!

283
00:12:03,599 --> 00:12:06,900
Just the right idea
at the right time.

284
00:12:06,902 --> 00:12:09,402
Okay, okay, so Amy's cool,
Sheldon's cool.

285
00:12:09,404 --> 00:12:11,605
Tell me about Leonard.
Who?

286
00:12:13,675 --> 00:12:15,075
Leonard Hofstadter.

287
00:12:15,077 --> 00:12:18,211
Oh, him.
I guess he's all right.

288
00:12:18,213 --> 00:12:20,714
Apparently he tricked some
hot girl into marrying him.

289
00:12:22,384 --> 00:12:24,751
That's me, I'm her.

290
00:12:24,753 --> 00:12:25,919
You know, he
didn't trick me.

291
00:12:25,921 --> 00:12:28,188
He just wore me down.

292
00:12:28,190 --> 00:12:30,957
It makes sense
you two are friends.

293
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:33,059
I mean, hot girls
always stick together.

294
00:12:35,898 --> 00:12:37,230
And you thought this
wasn't gonna be

295
00:12:37,232 --> 00:12:39,666
a great party.

296
00:12:39,668 --> 00:12:40,967
You know, I had no idea

297
00:12:40,969 --> 00:12:43,937
Caltech is exactly
like my high school.

298
00:12:43,939 --> 00:12:45,906
Well, it's not
exactly like it.

299
00:12:45,908 --> 00:12:48,909
We're all
extremely smart.

300
00:12:48,911 --> 00:12:52,178
Wow... you popular
girls are mean.

301
00:12:56,118 --> 00:12:57,951
I'm gonna get some coffee.
You want some?

302
00:12:57,953 --> 00:13:00,654
Uh, you're really going to
have caffeine in front of me

303
00:13:00,656 --> 00:13:02,856
when I'm trying to get
my life back on track?

304
00:13:04,459 --> 00:13:07,160
Uh, okay, let's pretend
you do have a problem.

305
00:13:07,162 --> 00:13:08,161
I do.
You don't.

306
00:13:08,163 --> 00:13:10,931
Yeah, but I do.
No, you don't!

307
00:13:10,933 --> 00:13:12,165
But let's say you do.

308
00:13:12,167 --> 00:13:13,833
And don't say you do,
because you don't!

309
00:13:15,504 --> 00:13:18,104
Now, wouldn't you think
that throwing yourself

310
00:13:18,106 --> 00:13:20,473
into your work would be
the best way to deal with it?

311
00:13:20,475 --> 00:13:22,809
With what?
Your problem.

312
00:13:22,811 --> 00:13:24,778
I thought I didn't have
a problem.

313
00:13:29,851 --> 00:13:31,785
That was painful
to watch.

314
00:13:36,258 --> 00:13:37,457
So where are we going?

315
00:13:37,459 --> 00:13:38,892
I don't know.

316
00:13:38,894 --> 00:13:39,993
Okay.

317
00:13:39,995 --> 00:13:43,663
How Thelma and Louise of us.

318
00:13:43,665 --> 00:13:46,900
Raj, why don't I care
about anything?

319
00:13:46,902 --> 00:13:47,901
I'm sorry?

320
00:13:47,903 --> 00:13:49,736
It's my baby.

321
00:13:49,738 --> 00:13:52,238
I-I should care about
nurseries and colors,

322
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:54,374
and I don't...
what's wrong with me?

323
00:13:54,376 --> 00:13:58,845
Well, crime-scene photos
near your crib spring to mind.

324
00:13:58,847 --> 00:14:01,047
I keep waiting
to feel excited,

325
00:14:01,049 --> 00:14:02,382
but it's not happening.

326
00:14:02,384 --> 00:14:05,785
What if it
never happens?

327
00:14:05,787 --> 00:14:07,854
Bernadette,
come on, look,

328
00:14:07,856 --> 00:14:10,156
you're overthinking this,
okay?

329
00:14:10,158 --> 00:14:12,359
You're gonna be
an amazing mom.

330
00:14:12,361 --> 00:14:13,593
Even if you don't
believe it,

331
00:14:13,595 --> 00:14:15,929
I know you have
maternal instincts.

332
00:14:15,931 --> 00:14:18,431
Once, I was supposed
to babysit my brothers.

333
00:14:18,433 --> 00:14:20,333
Our neighbor found them
naked in the backyard

334
00:14:20,335 --> 00:14:21,901
eating crickets.

335
00:14:23,805 --> 00:14:25,205
Happy and well-fed.

336
00:14:25,207 --> 00:14:27,273
You see, that's what
I'm taking from that story.

337
00:14:32,514 --> 00:14:34,347
Leonard, can I ask you
a question?

338
00:14:34,349 --> 00:14:35,849
Is it about the
rotational symmetries

339
00:14:35,851 --> 00:14:37,017
you should be
figuring out

340
00:14:37,019 --> 00:14:38,618
or your fake
caffeine problem?

341
00:14:40,722 --> 00:14:43,823
Howard, can I ask you
a question?

342
00:14:43,825 --> 00:14:45,725
No.

343
00:14:46,862 --> 00:14:48,361
All right, I'll just
toss this out to the room.

344
00:14:48,363 --> 00:14:50,664
Um, I was thinking
that the best way

345
00:14:50,666 --> 00:14:52,399
to fight my addiction is by

346
00:14:52,401 --> 00:14:54,267
weaning myself off in steps.

347
00:14:54,269 --> 00:14:56,336
Now, I couldn't find
a caffeine patch,

348
00:14:56,338 --> 00:14:58,738
but I did find
what claims to be

349
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:01,808
a mind-boosting
caffeine suppository.

350
00:15:01,810 --> 00:15:03,943
Yeah.

351
00:15:03,945 --> 00:15:05,979
You know, the interesting fact
about the rectum...

352
00:15:05,981 --> 00:15:07,614
Sheldon!

353
00:15:08,884 --> 00:15:11,284
We are dealing with
an impossible deadline

354
00:15:11,286 --> 00:15:12,852
from the Air Force
because of you.

355
00:15:12,854 --> 00:15:15,722
So have an energy drink,
don't have an energy drink.

356
00:15:15,724 --> 00:15:17,057
Order suppositories
and shove 'em

357
00:15:17,059 --> 00:15:19,592
wherever you want,
I don't care!

358
00:15:21,530 --> 00:15:22,529
You don't shove them.

359
00:15:22,531 --> 00:15:24,330
They come with an
easy-glide applicator.

360
00:15:27,102 --> 00:15:29,703
Right.
Listen to me.

361
00:15:29,705 --> 00:15:31,805
We can't do anything
until you do your part.

362
00:15:31,807 --> 00:15:34,374
So get up in front of
this whiteboard and do it!

363
00:15:34,376 --> 00:15:36,609
I can't.
Yes, you can.

364
00:15:36,611 --> 00:15:38,411
No...

365
00:15:38,413 --> 00:15:40,580
I can't figure out
the math.

366
00:15:40,582 --> 00:15:42,148
I've been racking
my brain for days,

367
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:45,118
and I've got nothing.

368
00:15:46,188 --> 00:15:47,220
Seriously?

369
00:15:47,222 --> 00:15:48,822
I can't do it.

370
00:15:48,824 --> 00:15:50,924
I'm not as smart
as I think I am.

371
00:15:50,926 --> 00:15:54,461
I'm so sorry.
This is all my fault.

372
00:15:58,033 --> 00:15:59,933
It's okay, we'll
figure something out.

373
00:15:59,935 --> 00:16:02,736
But what if we can't?

374
00:16:02,738 --> 00:16:06,106
It'll be fine.
You'll see.

375
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:13,446
Sheldon?

376
00:16:15,383 --> 00:16:18,151
Buddy?

377
00:16:23,191 --> 00:16:24,624
When the baby gets here,

378
00:16:24,626 --> 00:16:27,260
you gotta teach me that.

379
00:16:30,365 --> 00:16:33,032
Thank you so much, Bert.
This was great.

380
00:16:33,034 --> 00:16:34,334
My pleasure.

381
00:16:34,336 --> 00:16:35,535
You girls want
to take home

382
00:16:35,537 --> 00:16:37,937
a two-gallon tub
of potato salad?

383
00:16:39,407 --> 00:16:41,941
I think we're good.

384
00:16:41,943 --> 00:16:43,743
Okay, well,
thanks for coming by.

385
00:16:43,745 --> 00:16:44,811
You're nice people.

386
00:16:44,813 --> 00:16:47,480
Well, so are you.
In fact, you know what?

387
00:16:47,482 --> 00:16:50,817
We will never
take you for granite.

388
00:16:50,819 --> 00:16:53,920
Did you get that?
Granite?

389
00:16:53,922 --> 00:16:56,790
A little geology joke.

390
00:16:56,792 --> 00:16:58,191
You need to leave.

391
00:16:58,193 --> 00:16:59,526
I'm in love
with both of you now.

392
00:16:59,528 --> 00:17:01,327
Okay.
Bye.

393
00:17:04,566 --> 00:17:06,432
Uh, pull over.

394
00:17:06,434 --> 00:17:08,168
What? Why?
Who are you calling?

395
00:17:08,170 --> 00:17:10,370
You're gonna rat me out
to Howard, aren't you?

396
00:17:10,372 --> 00:17:13,706
You're such a snitch,
no wonder I don't like you.

397
00:17:14,943 --> 00:17:17,944
Whoa, I'm calling
my dad, okay?

398
00:17:17,946 --> 00:17:20,180
He's got experience
dealing with pregnant ladies

399
00:17:20,182 --> 00:17:21,581
because he's an OBGYN.

400
00:17:21,583 --> 00:17:23,316
And experience
with crazy ladies

401
00:17:23,318 --> 00:17:24,651
because of my mom.

402
00:17:26,955 --> 00:17:28,555
Hello, Rajesh.

403
00:17:28,557 --> 00:17:29,956
Are you calling
to ask for money?

404
00:17:29,958 --> 00:17:30,890
What? No.

405
00:17:30,892 --> 00:17:32,025
Are you calling to ask
for things

406
00:17:32,027 --> 00:17:34,093
that cost money?
No.

407
00:17:34,095 --> 00:17:36,062
Great. What's up?

408
00:17:36,064 --> 00:17:38,598
This is my friend,
Bernadette.

409
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,800
She's pregnant,
and she's a bit worried,

410
00:17:40,802 --> 00:17:42,402
so I thought maybe
you could talk to her.

411
00:17:42,404 --> 00:17:44,971
Of course.
What seems to be the trouble?

412
00:17:44,973 --> 00:17:46,105
Something's wrong.

413
00:17:46,107 --> 00:17:48,408
I don't care about
any of the baby stuff

414
00:17:48,410 --> 00:17:50,810
every other mom is so into.

415
00:17:50,812 --> 00:17:54,180
Honestly, I'm not even sure
I like babies.

416
00:17:54,182 --> 00:17:56,182
Look, some people are
baby people,

417
00:17:56,184 --> 00:17:58,251
and some people
are not baby people.

418
00:17:58,253 --> 00:18:00,587
It doesn't mean you won't
love your own baby.

419
00:18:00,589 --> 00:18:03,289
But I thought I'd be
more excited.

420
00:18:03,291 --> 00:18:07,093
Oh, being excited
isn't a guarantee of anything.

421
00:18:07,095 --> 00:18:10,096
Rajesh's mother was thrilled
when she was pregnant with him.

422
00:18:10,098 --> 00:18:13,533
After he was born, she doted
on his every move.

423
00:18:13,535 --> 00:18:14,801
And you know what happened?

424
00:18:14,803 --> 00:18:17,003
He broke her heart,
moved halfway around the world,

425
00:18:17,005 --> 00:18:18,972
and dates only
poor white women.

426
00:18:21,843 --> 00:18:23,776
So you never know.

427
00:18:23,778 --> 00:18:26,713
Thank you.
I feel better now.

428
00:18:26,715 --> 00:18:28,815
- I don't!
- Good.

429
00:18:28,817 --> 00:18:31,618
Bernadette, I hope
you have a daughter.

430
00:18:40,279 --> 00:18:43,780
Um, I don't really know
how to say this.

431
00:18:43,782 --> 00:18:45,449
Well, you could try
starting with "sir".

432
00:18:45,451 --> 00:18:47,451
Right. Sorry, sir.

433
00:18:47,453 --> 00:18:50,120
He said start with it,
not end with it.

434
00:18:51,724 --> 00:18:53,194
- Sir...
- Hmm?

435
00:18:53,195 --> 00:18:54,894
We've hit a bit
of a snag.

436
00:18:54,896 --> 00:18:56,830
We're already behind schedule.

437
00:18:57,833 --> 00:18:59,999
The computations required
to overcome

438
00:19:00,001 --> 00:19:01,401
the deployability issues

439
00:19:01,403 --> 00:19:03,737
are more significant
than we thought.

440
00:19:03,739 --> 00:19:05,772
I understand that
we're under contract,

441
00:19:05,774 --> 00:19:07,374
and I don't know what
the consequences

442
00:19:07,376 --> 00:19:09,442
of violating that are,
but, uh...

443
00:19:09,444 --> 00:19:11,945
we're not gonna
be able to deliver

444
00:19:11,947 --> 00:19:13,513
in the time we promised.

445
00:19:20,222 --> 00:19:21,921
How long do you need?

446
00:19:23,325 --> 00:19:27,127
We-We're thinking...
two years.

447
00:19:29,898 --> 00:19:31,097
All right.

448
00:19:32,634 --> 00:19:34,200
That's it?

449
00:19:34,202 --> 00:19:35,602
You're okay with that?

450
00:19:35,604 --> 00:19:38,071
You think you're
the first government contractor

451
00:19:38,073 --> 00:19:40,306
who isn't gonna deliver
on time?

452
00:19:40,308 --> 00:19:41,975
We're still waiting
for a big space laser

453
00:19:41,977 --> 00:19:44,778
Reagan ordered
to beat the commies.

454
00:19:46,415 --> 00:19:47,847
Thanks for understanding,
sir.

455
00:19:47,849 --> 00:19:49,549
Yes, thank you
so much.

456
00:19:49,551 --> 00:19:51,818
We-We really
appreciate it.

457
00:19:53,221 --> 00:19:54,254
All right,
pressure's off

458
00:19:54,256 --> 00:19:55,422
Wanna see a movie?

459
00:19:55,424 --> 00:19:57,257
Popcorn's on me.
