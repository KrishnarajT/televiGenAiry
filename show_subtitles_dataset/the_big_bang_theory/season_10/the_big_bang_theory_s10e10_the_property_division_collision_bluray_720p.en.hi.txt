1
00:00:01,034 --> 00:00:03,101
If we're going to be staying
in this apartment,

2
00:00:03,103 --> 00:00:04,536
would you be interested
in doing a little

3
00:00:04,538 --> 00:00:05,937
redecorating?

4
00:00:06,773 --> 00:00:09,908
Oh, actually, I would.

5
00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:11,776
Great, what'd you have in mind?

6
00:00:11,778 --> 00:00:14,913
Let's take every single thing
from the other apartment

7
00:00:14,915 --> 00:00:17,015
and put it in here.

8
00:00:17,017 --> 00:00:19,517
Well, how about we start
a little smaller?

9
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:21,953
Like moving
the furniture around.

10
00:00:21,955 --> 00:00:24,189
You know, I have always thought

11
00:00:24,191 --> 00:00:26,124
that this couch
would look fantastic

12
00:00:26,126 --> 00:00:28,760
on the curb
in front of the building.

13
00:00:28,762 --> 00:00:32,263
Look, we can't just
throw away Penny's stuff,

14
00:00:32,265 --> 00:00:35,833
but we can ask
if she wants any of it back.

15
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:38,703
You know, I wonder how
she feels about

16
00:00:38,705 --> 00:00:40,972
all this artwork.

17
00:00:40,974 --> 00:00:43,608
Well, I'm sure
she misses this one.

18
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:46,978
I mean, it's the greatest gift
I've ever given anybody.

19
00:00:52,586 --> 00:00:57,388
It truly does capture the beauty
of your friendship with Penny.

20
00:00:59,326 --> 00:01:01,059
It may have appreciated
in value.

21
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:04,229
The artist killed himself
shortly after painting that.

22
00:01:05,265 --> 00:01:08,933
Yeah, it seems only right
that she have it back.

23
00:01:08,935 --> 00:01:10,535
I can't wait to see
the look on her face

24
00:01:10,537 --> 00:01:13,137
when I give it to her again.

25
00:01:18,411 --> 00:01:21,980
Look, it's the same smile
she has in the painting.

@elder_man

36
00:01:51,947 --> 00:01:54,948
Yeah... there's hooks in the
closet, I can hang it right now.

37
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:56,783
Oh, no, no,
Th-those hooks are gone.

38
00:01:56,785 --> 00:01:58,018
What happened to them?

39
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:00,053
Uh, we ran out of candy
on Halloween,

40
00:02:00,055 --> 00:02:02,756
I was just giving
everything away.

41
00:02:03,592 --> 00:02:05,259
Hey, guys, what are you...?

42
00:02:05,261 --> 00:02:07,494
Oh, that's here, cool.

43
00:02:07,496 --> 00:02:10,264
Amy wants me to have it.

44
00:02:10,266 --> 00:02:11,932
Well, it would be selfish
of me to keep it.

45
00:02:11,934 --> 00:02:13,767
B-But it's a picture of you.

46
00:02:13,769 --> 00:02:15,569
And you.

47
00:02:15,571 --> 00:02:17,671
But you commissioned it.

48
00:02:17,673 --> 00:02:19,840
To give to you.

49
00:02:19,842 --> 00:02:22,109
But you like it so much.

50
00:02:22,111 --> 00:02:24,077
So do you.

51
00:02:25,114 --> 00:02:26,780
I seem to be losing.

52
00:02:26,782 --> 00:02:29,416
Yes, you do.

53
00:02:29,418 --> 00:02:31,185
You know, Leonard,
the more I think about it,

54
00:02:31,187 --> 00:02:33,854
there are a number of mutually
owned items in this apartment

55
00:02:33,856 --> 00:02:35,322
that you and I
should go through.

56
00:02:35,324 --> 00:02:36,623
Uh, for example...

57
00:02:37,626 --> 00:02:39,960
who gets our beloved sword,
Longclaw?

58
00:02:39,962 --> 00:02:40,961
Why don't you keep it?

59
00:02:40,963 --> 00:02:42,229
That seems fair;
we did just give you

60
00:02:42,231 --> 00:02:44,097
the painting.

61
00:02:44,099 --> 00:02:45,465
Yeah, I don't need
anything around

62
00:02:45,467 --> 00:02:47,634
that I can stab myself with.

63
00:02:47,636 --> 00:02:49,069
Wonderful,

64
00:02:49,071 --> 00:02:50,304
Longclaw is mine.

65
00:02:50,306 --> 00:02:52,272
And how about you keep

66
00:02:52,274 --> 00:02:54,474
our... avocado plant?

67
00:02:58,447 --> 00:03:01,048
Sounds right...
a limited edition collectible

68
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:02,416
worth hundreds of dollars

69
00:03:02,418 --> 00:03:03,650
and a thing

70
00:03:03,652 --> 00:03:06,687
that grew out of a thing
we fished from the trash.

71
00:03:06,689 --> 00:03:09,590
Although, Amy and I did
just move in together,

72
00:03:09,592 --> 00:03:12,226
and a plant is
a lovely housewarming gift.

73
00:03:12,228 --> 00:03:14,328
Fine, take the plant.

74
00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:15,829
Oh, we got a sword
and a plant;

75
00:03:15,831 --> 00:03:17,397
our apartment's
really shaping up.

76
00:03:20,903 --> 00:03:22,703
Stuart, you didn't have
to get us a baby gift.

77
00:03:22,705 --> 00:03:23,971
Oh.

78
00:03:23,973 --> 00:03:26,506
Just homemade coupons for things
you might need help with

79
00:03:26,508 --> 00:03:27,908
before the baby gets here.

80
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:31,011
Going to the grocery store,
driving you to the doctor.

81
00:03:31,013 --> 00:03:34,314
If you're not in a hurry,
I can dig you a koi pond.

82
00:03:36,285 --> 00:03:38,185
A foot massage?

83
00:03:38,187 --> 00:03:41,521
And that's not me being creepy,
that's for either of you.

84
00:03:43,692 --> 00:03:46,827
This is very nice,
Stuart, thank you.

85
00:03:46,829 --> 00:03:49,963
How come this one's on
the back of an eviction notice?

86
00:03:49,965 --> 00:03:53,567
Oh, yeah.
Uh, now that you mention it...

87
00:03:53,569 --> 00:03:55,902
can I live here?

88
00:03:57,273 --> 00:03:59,740
Stuart, we'd love
to help you out,

89
00:03:59,742 --> 00:04:02,776
but this a bad time;
we're about to have a baby.

90
00:04:02,778 --> 00:04:04,511
Or is that why
this is a great time?

91
00:04:04,513 --> 00:04:06,513
Think about it...
when that baby comes,

92
00:04:06,515 --> 00:04:08,749
you're gonna need all the help
you can get.

93
00:04:08,751 --> 00:04:10,183
Thank you,

94
00:04:10,185 --> 00:04:12,152
but I'm not really sure.

95
00:04:13,088 --> 00:04:14,621
Hang on, maybe it's
not the worst idea.

96
00:04:14,623 --> 00:04:17,557
I mean, he did do a good job
taking care of my mother.

97
00:04:17,559 --> 00:04:21,828
That woman didn't get heat rash
once with me on powder patrol.

98
00:04:23,565 --> 00:04:24,898
Hey...

99
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:26,466
I guess you could stay
for a few days

100
00:04:26,468 --> 00:04:27,768
and we'll see how it goes.

101
00:04:27,770 --> 00:04:29,169
Thank you.

102
00:04:29,171 --> 00:04:30,971
And it's only temporary,

103
00:04:30,973 --> 00:04:33,140
just till I get back on my feet.

104
00:04:33,142 --> 00:04:35,942
or the baby goes off to college,
whichever happens first.

105
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,513
When would you move in?

106
00:04:39,515 --> 00:04:42,282
Well, uh, my car broke down
in your driveway,

107
00:04:42,284 --> 00:04:44,685
so I'm gonna say now.

108
00:04:45,788 --> 00:04:47,688
But I am ready to be helpful.

109
00:04:47,690 --> 00:04:49,556
In fact...

110
00:04:49,558 --> 00:04:50,524
I'm gonna go vacuum.

111
00:04:50,526 --> 00:04:54,161
Hmm. Actually I just
did that this morning.

112
00:04:54,163 --> 00:04:55,562
Okay.

113
00:04:55,564 --> 00:04:56,830
Then I'll dust.

114
00:04:56,832 --> 00:04:59,032
I did that, too.

115
00:04:59,034 --> 00:05:02,336
Then I'll check the batteries
in the smoke detectors.

116
00:05:02,338 --> 00:05:04,171
Howard just did that.

117
00:05:04,173 --> 00:05:07,240
Yeah, let him do it.

118
00:05:10,846 --> 00:05:12,446
Oh.

119
00:05:12,448 --> 00:05:13,814
Remember when we got this

120
00:05:13,816 --> 00:05:15,248
at Comic-Con?

121
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:16,550
Oh, yeah.

122
00:05:16,552 --> 00:05:19,553
The Mr. Spock cuckoo clock.

123
00:05:19,555 --> 00:05:23,123
Live long and prosper.
Live long and prosper.

124
00:05:23,125 --> 00:05:24,891
Live long
and prosper.

125
00:05:24,893 --> 00:05:26,893
Live long and prosper.

126
00:05:26,895 --> 00:05:29,229
It's one of a kind.

127
00:05:29,231 --> 00:05:32,332
So if it breaks
there'd be none of it?

128
00:05:33,535 --> 00:05:34,668
Well, Leonard,

129
00:05:34,670 --> 00:05:36,503
you know, who should keep this?

130
00:05:36,505 --> 00:05:40,407
On the one hand, I love
Mr. Spock more than you do.

131
00:05:40,409 --> 00:05:43,677
On the other hand, I care more
about clocks than you do.

132
00:05:43,679 --> 00:05:45,212
So you think you should keep it?

133
00:05:45,214 --> 00:05:46,480
I'll be right across the hall.

134
00:05:46,482 --> 00:05:48,648
You'll probably be able
to hear it.

135
00:05:50,853 --> 00:05:52,119
Keep the clock, Sheldon.

136
00:05:52,121 --> 00:05:53,253
Thank you.

137
00:05:53,255 --> 00:05:55,856
Thank you.
Thank you?

138
00:05:56,725 --> 00:05:58,458
Oh, now...

139
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:00,394
what about

140
00:06:00,396 --> 00:06:01,862
our 3-D chess set?

141
00:06:01,864 --> 00:06:02,929
Let me guess, you want it.

142
00:06:02,931 --> 00:06:04,231
Well, no,

143
00:06:04,233 --> 00:06:05,899
I just didn't think you'd want
a physical reminder

144
00:06:05,901 --> 00:06:08,635
of a game you never
managed to win.

145
00:06:08,637 --> 00:06:11,071
As a kindness, I should probably
take all the games.

146
00:06:11,073 --> 00:06:13,473
You know what, Sheldon, take it.

147
00:06:13,475 --> 00:06:15,041
In fact, you can
have everything.

148
00:06:15,043 --> 00:06:16,476
I really don't care.

149
00:06:16,712 --> 00:06:18,479
Are you sure?

150
00:06:18,481 --> 00:06:21,315
These items represent
our shared times together.

151
00:06:21,317 --> 00:06:22,816
Well, now they're yours.
Leonard...

152
00:06:22,818 --> 00:06:24,151
Well, you know
what's gonna happen.

153
00:06:24,153 --> 00:06:25,419
He's just gonna come up
with some reason

154
00:06:25,421 --> 00:06:26,887
why everything should be his.

155
00:06:26,889 --> 00:06:28,756
For a man so good
at predicting my moves,

156
00:06:28,758 --> 00:06:30,791
how come you stink at 3-D chess?

157
00:06:31,894 --> 00:06:34,528
Sheldon, you're-you're being
a little selfish.

158
00:06:34,530 --> 00:06:36,797
Why don't you let Leonard
keep a few things?

159
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:38,098
It's not my fault
I'm bad at sharing;

160
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:39,900
I skipped kindergarten.

161
00:06:39,902 --> 00:06:41,502
You know what?

162
00:06:41,504 --> 00:06:44,071
There is one thing I would like.

163
00:06:44,073 --> 00:06:46,440
Yeah, take whatever you want.

164
00:06:46,442 --> 00:06:48,609
I would like to keep...

165
00:06:48,611 --> 00:06:51,378
the official flag
of our apartment.

166
00:06:52,248 --> 00:06:54,581
But you don't even like flags.

167
00:06:54,583 --> 00:06:56,383
Yeah, I like this one.

168
00:06:58,421 --> 00:07:00,721
But I designed it.

169
00:07:00,723 --> 00:07:03,824
But you made me order it because
you were "too well-known"

170
00:07:03,826 --> 00:07:07,928
in the flag community
and they'd jack up the price.

171
00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:09,263
But you don't even understand

172
00:07:09,265 --> 00:07:11,598
its symbolism.
Oh, I do.

173
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:14,968
The-the field of blue
represents you being miserable,

174
00:07:14,970 --> 00:07:17,638
and the lion sticking
its tongue out means

175
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:19,506
I'm happy about it.

176
00:07:22,611 --> 00:07:25,045
Come along, Amy.

177
00:07:25,047 --> 00:07:27,314
I know when I'm not wanted.

178
00:07:28,217 --> 00:07:32,319
I don't think you do,
but all right.

179
00:07:34,623 --> 00:07:37,257
Stuart, you cooked?

180
00:07:37,259 --> 00:07:38,892
How did you know it wasn't me?

181
00:07:38,894 --> 00:07:40,594
There's only three
people in this house,

182
00:07:40,596 --> 00:07:42,730
and you'd still be
my fifth guess.

183
00:07:44,734 --> 00:07:47,134
That's Raj.

184
00:07:47,136 --> 00:07:48,302
You guys relax,

185
00:07:48,304 --> 00:07:49,403
I'll get it.

186
00:07:49,405 --> 00:07:52,106
Have some bread
while it's still warm.

187
00:07:53,509 --> 00:07:54,875
It's like we have a butler.

188
00:07:54,877 --> 00:07:57,911
If I had a Batsuit
I'd be Bruce Wayne.

189
00:07:58,748 --> 00:08:01,915
You have a Batsuit.

190
00:08:01,917 --> 00:08:04,384
It's pajamas, there's no cape.

191
00:08:05,688 --> 00:08:07,321
Hey, Raj.

192
00:08:07,323 --> 00:08:08,555
Hey, Stuart.

193
00:08:08,557 --> 00:08:11,058
What are you doing here?
Oh, I'm living here again.

194
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:14,394
Do, uh, Howard
and Bernadette know?

195
00:08:14,396 --> 00:08:17,765
Or is it like a possum
in the walls kind of thing?

196
00:08:17,767 --> 00:08:21,568
No, I needed a place to stay

197
00:08:21,570 --> 00:08:22,736
and, with the baby coming,

198
00:08:22,738 --> 00:08:24,438
I figured they could
use some extra help.

199
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:26,974
Okay, cool.

200
00:08:26,976 --> 00:08:28,308
Anyway, come on in,
dinner's ready.

201
00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:30,043
Oh, but I bought
Chinese takeout.

202
00:08:30,045 --> 00:08:32,246
Oh, okay.

203
00:08:32,248 --> 00:08:35,182
Well, if Bernadette wants her
ankles to swell up even more,

204
00:08:35,184 --> 00:08:36,383
she can have that.

205
00:08:40,523 --> 00:08:43,390
Is the Wi-Fi working for you?

206
00:08:43,392 --> 00:08:45,759
Uh, hang on.

207
00:08:45,761 --> 00:08:47,628
I don't think so,
I'm clicking on

208
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:48,929
"One weird trick
for a flat belly,"

209
00:08:48,931 --> 00:08:49,930
but I'm still seeing

210
00:08:49,932 --> 00:08:53,233
"Celebrities who look like
their pets."

211
00:08:53,235 --> 00:08:55,335
Oh, I knew it,

212
00:08:55,337 --> 00:08:56,970
Sheldon changed the password.

213
00:08:56,972 --> 00:08:57,971
Are you sure?

214
00:08:57,973 --> 00:08:59,473
Well, the new network name is,

215
00:08:59,475 --> 00:09:03,343
"Ha ha ha, now I've got you,"
so...

216
00:09:04,814 --> 00:09:08,015
It's either Sheldon
or Gargamel from The Smurfs.

217
00:09:08,017 --> 00:09:10,050
What a jerk.

218
00:09:10,052 --> 00:09:12,553
You're good at revenge;
how do we get him back?

219
00:09:12,555 --> 00:09:14,254
Well, my go-to move is usually

220
00:09:14,256 --> 00:09:15,756
sleep with the
person's boyfriend,

221
00:09:15,758 --> 00:09:19,359
but I kind of feel like
I'm already doing that.

222
00:09:26,001 --> 00:09:27,501
Sheldon, I know what you did,

223
00:09:27,503 --> 00:09:30,070
now change the password back.

224
00:09:30,072 --> 00:09:33,941
Well, powder me in sugar
and call me a donut,

225
00:09:33,943 --> 00:09:37,444
if it isn't Leonard Hofstadter.

226
00:09:37,446 --> 00:09:40,380
Sheldon, I'm warning you,
I can play this game, too.

227
00:09:40,382 --> 00:09:42,249
If it's like
your 3-D chess game,

228
00:09:42,251 --> 00:09:44,885
then you're out of your length,
width and depth.

229
00:09:45,788 --> 00:09:48,188
Amy, get the Neosporin,

230
00:09:48,190 --> 00:09:50,691
somebody just got burned.

231
00:09:51,493 --> 00:09:53,961
All right, I tried.

232
00:09:53,963 --> 00:09:56,196
"All right,
I tried."

233
00:09:56,198 --> 00:09:58,899
That should be the title
of your autobiography.

234
00:10:00,135 --> 00:10:03,237
Ooh, a second-degree burn.

235
00:10:04,173 --> 00:10:05,339
I've got the Neosporin.

236
00:10:05,341 --> 00:10:07,140
Who got hurt?

237
00:10:07,142 --> 00:10:08,508
It's a good thing you're cute.

238
00:10:16,952 --> 00:10:20,287
So, I was reading how it's
a good idea for new parents

239
00:10:20,289 --> 00:10:22,456
to take an
infant CPR class.

240
00:10:22,458 --> 00:10:24,925
Yeah, we've been
meaning to do that.

241
00:10:24,927 --> 00:10:27,694
Oh, I know a CPR instructor
who'll come to the house.

242
00:10:27,696 --> 00:10:29,630
- That'd be great.
- I'll give him a call.

243
00:10:29,632 --> 00:10:31,331
We met when I was sleeping
on the beach

244
00:10:31,333 --> 00:10:32,866
and he thought I was dead.

245
00:10:35,671 --> 00:10:37,104
Thank you again
for cooking.

246
00:10:37,106 --> 00:10:39,473
It's getting tough for me
to be on my feet all day.

247
00:10:39,475 --> 00:10:42,342
You just kick back and relax;
I've got it all under control.

248
00:10:43,212 --> 00:10:45,445
Although it was
already under control.

249
00:10:46,982 --> 00:10:49,216
I'm sorry,
you mumbled something?

250
00:10:50,085 --> 00:10:51,852
It's just that

251
00:10:51,854 --> 00:10:53,887
they've had plenty of help.

252
00:10:53,889 --> 00:10:56,156
Well, you know what they say...
it takes a village.

253
00:10:56,158 --> 00:10:58,625
Well, they already
had a village.

254
00:10:59,862 --> 00:11:01,662
I noticed the village
couldn't find time

255
00:11:01,664 --> 00:11:03,196
to put the crib together.

256
00:11:03,198 --> 00:11:04,431
Yeah, well, maybe

257
00:11:04,433 --> 00:11:06,199
the village was too busy
checking out

258
00:11:06,201 --> 00:11:07,968
the local Montessori school
for the new arrival.

259
00:11:07,970 --> 00:11:09,002
You mean the one

260
00:11:09,004 --> 00:11:10,938
with the empty beer bottles
in the sandbox?

261
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:12,639
We'll pass, thank you.

262
00:11:14,209 --> 00:11:17,110
Do something, Batman.

263
00:11:21,917 --> 00:11:24,117
Hey.

264
00:11:25,788 --> 00:11:27,621
What do you think you're doing?

265
00:11:27,623 --> 00:11:30,657
Separating my delicates.

266
00:11:31,961 --> 00:11:33,627
This is the level
you're stooping to.

267
00:11:33,629 --> 00:11:34,594
No.

268
00:11:34,596 --> 00:11:39,666
This is the level
I am stooping to.

269
00:11:43,105 --> 00:11:47,941
I believe that is flag
to crotch four, checkmate.

270
00:11:48,744 --> 00:11:51,878
Easy-peasy, ooh, so breezy.

271
00:12:05,031 --> 00:12:06,031
Hey, what's up?

272
00:12:06,099 --> 00:12:07,499
I'm here to put
the crib together.

273
00:12:07,501 --> 00:12:09,334
Ooh, sorry, I already did it.

274
00:12:09,336 --> 00:12:13,171
Oh, I don't know if you realize
this, but I bought that crib.

275
00:12:13,173 --> 00:12:17,575
Oh, yeah, I read about that
on WhoGivesACrap.com

276
00:12:19,379 --> 00:12:20,779
Why are you being like this?

277
00:12:21,848 --> 00:12:23,715
Because I love
Howard and Bernadette

278
00:12:23,717 --> 00:12:27,118
and if I want to keep mooching
off them, I need to be helpful.

279
00:12:27,988 --> 00:12:29,053
Hey, this pregnancy had

280
00:12:29,055 --> 00:12:30,088
an emotionally-needy third wheel

281
00:12:30,090 --> 00:12:32,223
way before you came along.

282
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,560
Why can't there be four wheels?

283
00:12:35,562 --> 00:12:38,129
Is this what you do
when I'm not here,

284
00:12:38,131 --> 00:12:40,365
make really good points?

285
00:12:40,367 --> 00:12:44,169
Look-Look, just come in and
help me build a baby swing.

286
00:12:44,171 --> 00:12:45,970
Thank you.

287
00:12:45,972 --> 00:12:49,174
If you're hungry you can eat
your takeout; nobody touched it.

288
00:12:51,344 --> 00:12:52,811
I think I'm gonna
go for a run.

289
00:12:52,813 --> 00:12:54,145
You want to come?

290
00:12:54,147 --> 00:12:57,048
No, last time that old lady
in the park kept screaming,

291
00:12:57,050 --> 00:12:59,651
"Watch out, he's
right behind you."

292
00:13:03,356 --> 00:13:04,889
Hello?

293
00:13:04,891 --> 00:13:08,226
Hey, how you doing?

294
00:13:09,062 --> 00:13:11,329
Uh, can I help you?

295
00:13:11,331 --> 00:13:14,999
I don't think so,
but you're sweet for asking.

296
00:13:15,836 --> 00:13:16,901
What-What are you doing

297
00:13:16,903 --> 00:13:18,403
in our apartment?

298
00:13:18,405 --> 00:13:22,774
Oh, I rented a room from
your neighbor, the tall guy...

299
00:13:22,776 --> 00:13:25,477
dressed like a little boy.

300
00:13:26,313 --> 00:13:27,846
Unbelievable.

301
00:13:27,848 --> 00:13:30,448
Okay, uh, I don't know
what he told you,

302
00:13:30,450 --> 00:13:32,150
but you can't stay here.

303
00:13:32,152 --> 00:13:34,586
So, there are fresh linens
on the bed and...

304
00:13:34,588 --> 00:13:35,553
Oh.

305
00:13:35,555 --> 00:13:37,455
Well, now, I see
you've met Theodore.

306
00:13:39,092 --> 00:13:41,926
Theodore, these
are your new roommates,

307
00:13:41,928 --> 00:13:43,261
Leonard and Penny.

308
00:13:43,263 --> 00:13:44,596
They're very honest,

309
00:13:44,598 --> 00:13:46,164
but I would not leave
cash lying around.

310
00:13:46,166 --> 00:13:48,233
Sheldon,

311
00:13:48,235 --> 00:13:49,634
what do you think
you're doing?

312
00:13:49,636 --> 00:13:51,970
My room is paid up
until the end of the month,

313
00:13:51,972 --> 00:13:53,371
so I can do
with it whatever

314
00:13:53,373 --> 00:13:54,639
I please, which includes

315
00:13:54,641 --> 00:13:57,208
renting it out
for a dollar a night.

316
00:13:57,210 --> 00:13:59,043
It's like the '40s again.

317
00:14:02,215 --> 00:14:04,916
Anyway, I'll leave you be.

318
00:14:04,918 --> 00:14:06,117
I have to... oh, oh!

319
00:14:06,119 --> 00:14:08,219
He's expecting a newspaper
in the morning.

320
00:14:08,221 --> 00:14:10,421
Apparently,
they still make them.

321
00:14:10,423 --> 00:14:13,157
All right, Sheldon,
this is over the line.

322
00:14:13,159 --> 00:14:14,125
That's true,

323
00:14:14,127 --> 00:14:16,227
but had I done
something under the line,

324
00:14:16,229 --> 00:14:17,729
there wouldn't be a man
in your kitchen

325
00:14:17,731 --> 00:14:19,998
who can't produce
a single form of ID.

326
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,866
Oh, oh, I have a receipt
from a blood bank.

327
00:14:22,469 --> 00:14:24,936
I'm O-negative.

328
00:14:28,141 --> 00:14:30,875
And now you know as much
about him as I do.

329
00:14:34,247 --> 00:14:36,281
Oh, hey, Bernadette,

330
00:14:36,283 --> 00:14:38,316
the swing comes
with two different mobiles.

331
00:14:38,318 --> 00:14:42,186
The giraffes are pretty cute,
what do you think?

332
00:14:42,188 --> 00:14:43,922
Great, go with the giraffes.

333
00:14:43,924 --> 00:14:45,156
Although...

334
00:14:45,158 --> 00:14:47,492
the high contrast
of zebra stripes might provide

335
00:14:47,494 --> 00:14:49,594
better stimulus
for a developing baby.

336
00:14:50,664 --> 00:14:54,032
Yeah, you're probably right,
go with the zebras.

337
00:14:54,034 --> 00:14:55,833
Good choice, boss.

338
00:14:58,204 --> 00:15:00,872
At least my nose
is naturally brown.

339
00:15:04,644 --> 00:15:07,111
Hey, could you please go
to the market for me?

340
00:15:07,113 --> 00:15:08,980
Get Stuart or Raj to do it.

341
00:15:08,982 --> 00:15:11,716
Howie, they've been doing
everything for you.

342
00:15:11,718 --> 00:15:13,017
Mm, I know.

343
00:15:13,019 --> 00:15:15,553
It's really making me
lose respect for both of them.

344
00:15:16,356 --> 00:15:18,289
Please just go to the store.

345
00:15:18,291 --> 00:15:20,992
Fine.

346
00:15:20,994 --> 00:15:23,428
Who wants to drive me
to the store?

347
00:15:23,430 --> 00:15:24,963
- Me!
- I'll do it!

348
00:15:24,965 --> 00:15:26,030
Take Raj.

349
00:15:26,032 --> 00:15:29,467
Stuart is supposed
to paint my toenails.

350
00:15:40,246 --> 00:15:41,245
What do you think?

351
00:15:41,247 --> 00:15:42,580
Should we go to a hotel?

352
00:15:42,582 --> 00:15:44,582
And just leave
him here alone?

353
00:15:44,584 --> 00:15:46,050
Okay, I'll go to a hotel.

354
00:15:46,052 --> 00:15:48,519
Text me in the morning
if you're still alive.

355
00:15:51,157 --> 00:15:52,190
Uh, Theodore,

356
00:15:52,192 --> 00:15:53,424
how long

357
00:15:53,426 --> 00:15:55,893
are you planning
to stay exactly?

358
00:15:55,895 --> 00:15:58,396
Oh, thanks to the coins
I found in your couch,

359
00:15:58,398 --> 00:16:00,965
a day longer than I thought.

360
00:16:01,768 --> 00:16:03,601
This is ridiculous.

361
00:16:06,306 --> 00:16:08,406
I like the painting.

362
00:16:08,408 --> 00:16:10,508
Is that your mom?

363
00:16:15,115 --> 00:16:17,882
Sheldon, get out here!

364
00:16:18,685 --> 00:16:20,284
Will you keep it down?

365
00:16:20,286 --> 00:16:21,953
What kind of vengeful
bed and breakfast

366
00:16:21,955 --> 00:16:24,122
do you think I'm running?

367
00:16:24,124 --> 00:16:26,691
We lived together
13 years.

368
00:16:26,693 --> 00:16:27,992
How can you be so awful to me?

369
00:16:27,994 --> 00:16:29,427
I'm being awful?

370
00:16:29,429 --> 00:16:31,496
You're the one who went
out of your way to hurt me.

371
00:16:31,498 --> 00:16:32,730
Because you were
being selfish.

372
00:16:32,732 --> 00:16:35,033
Dividing our belongings
is difficult.

373
00:16:35,035 --> 00:16:36,834
Why?
I said I didn't care!

374
00:16:36,836 --> 00:16:38,302
Excuse me.

375
00:16:38,304 --> 00:16:41,472
It's none of my business,
but it sounds like a lot

376
00:16:41,474 --> 00:16:45,643
of this anger
is coming from love.

377
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:50,014
Yeah, thanks,
but nobody asked you.

378
00:16:50,016 --> 00:16:53,184
Well, I'm just gonna
keep on talking.

379
00:16:54,054 --> 00:16:55,319
Seems like, with Sheldon

380
00:16:55,321 --> 00:17:00,224
moving out, you're
in a new phase of your lives

381
00:17:00,226 --> 00:17:01,726
and it's easier

382
00:17:01,728 --> 00:17:04,729
to fight than
to face the feelings

383
00:17:04,731 --> 00:17:07,632
that you have for one another.

384
00:17:09,035 --> 00:17:11,436
I think he might be right.

385
00:17:11,438 --> 00:17:13,404
Also, who is that?

386
00:17:14,607 --> 00:17:17,475
I have to admit,

387
00:17:17,477 --> 00:17:19,110
leaving you to
move in with Amy

388
00:17:19,112 --> 00:17:21,546
has been harder than
I thought it would be.

389
00:17:21,548 --> 00:17:23,181
Well, for me, too.

390
00:17:23,183 --> 00:17:25,116
It's not the same
with you gone.

391
00:17:25,118 --> 00:17:26,818
If you're looking for a new guy
to live with...

392
00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:28,586
- No!
- We're good. Thank you.

393
00:17:29,889 --> 00:17:32,557
So, no one's gonna
tell me? Okay.

394
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:33,891
Leonard,

395
00:17:33,893 --> 00:17:35,293
I would like us
to stop fighting

396
00:17:35,295 --> 00:17:36,661
about our possessions.

397
00:17:36,663 --> 00:17:38,296
Well, I'd like that, too.

398
00:17:38,298 --> 00:17:41,632
In fact, I want you to
keep the apartment flag,

399
00:17:41,634 --> 00:17:42,934
and I'm not
just saying that

400
00:17:42,936 --> 00:17:45,470
because it touched
your genitals.

401
00:17:45,472 --> 00:17:46,871
You promise?

402
00:17:46,873 --> 00:17:48,072
I do.

403
00:17:48,074 --> 00:17:49,707
And to show you that there
are no hard feelings,

404
00:17:49,709 --> 00:17:53,578
I am willing to rub my
genitals on it as well.

405
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:54,979
Well...

406
00:17:54,981 --> 00:17:59,317
if we're rubbing genitals
on things, that's where I shine.

407
00:18:09,537 --> 00:18:12,171
Little lower to the left.

408
00:18:12,173 --> 00:18:15,041
A little more.

409
00:18:15,043 --> 00:18:16,476
Is it good?

410
00:18:16,478 --> 00:18:19,178
No, still hideous.

411
00:18:22,584 --> 00:18:25,117
Well, I'm sure
at some point,

412
00:18:25,119 --> 00:18:26,719
we won't even
notice it's there.

413
00:18:26,721 --> 00:18:27,687
Yeah, you'd think that,

414
00:18:27,689 --> 00:18:29,288
but after a while it starts

415
00:18:29,290 --> 00:18:31,791
showing up in your dreams.

416
00:18:32,627 --> 00:18:34,827
I think it brings
the room together.

417
00:18:37,499 --> 00:18:39,532
Hey, tomorrow who wants
to paint the nursery?

418
00:18:39,534 --> 00:18:40,399
I'll do it.

419
00:18:40,401 --> 00:18:41,534
Why do you get to do it?

420
00:18:41,536 --> 00:18:42,568
I'm the artist.

421
00:18:42,570 --> 00:18:43,669
Just because you're starving

422
00:18:43,671 --> 00:18:45,605
doesn't make you an artist.

423
00:18:45,607 --> 00:18:48,875
Just because I look sickly
doesn't mean I'm starving.

424
00:18:48,877 --> 00:18:50,843
Howard!

425
00:18:51,946 --> 00:18:54,714
Guys, you heard her,
go see what she wants.

426
00:18:56,584 --> 00:18:58,384
I think I'm in labor.

427
00:18:58,386 --> 00:18:59,719
Oh, oh, okay.

428
00:18:59,721 --> 00:19:02,421
Okay, uh, uh, uh,
I can do this.

429
00:19:02,423 --> 00:19:03,556
We have a plan.

430
00:19:03,558 --> 00:19:05,625
Somebody please
tell me the plan.

431
00:19:05,627 --> 00:19:07,860
I'll get the hospital bag.
I'll pull the van up.

432
00:19:07,862 --> 00:19:08,928
Meet you outside in 2 minutes.

433
00:19:08,930 --> 00:19:11,397
Team Baby, go!

434
00:19:13,568 --> 00:19:14,734
I love you.

435
00:19:14,736 --> 00:19:16,702
I love you, too.

436
00:19:17,624 --> 00:19:20,625
Are we hugging or having a baby?
Let's go!

437
00:19:22,534 --> 00:19:29,334
