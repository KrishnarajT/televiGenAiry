1
00:00:04,397 --> 00:00:05,914
Previously on
The Big Bang Theory...

2
00:00:06,769 --> 00:00:08,535
What's this?
Oh, nothing,

3
00:00:08,537 --> 00:00:09,503
just some math we don't need.

4
00:00:09,505 --> 00:00:11,005
This is a different approach.

5
00:00:11,007 --> 00:00:13,907
You trying to get the
guidance system even smaller?

6
00:00:13,909 --> 00:00:15,809
It's just a... theory.

7
00:00:15,811 --> 00:00:17,511
Well, it's not even worked out.

8
00:00:17,513 --> 00:00:19,747
Oh.

9
00:00:19,749 --> 00:00:21,515
I want this.

10
00:00:22,518 --> 00:00:25,452
Uh, but we've already met
the agreed upon specs.

11
00:00:25,454 --> 00:00:27,321
Going smaller
would require

12
00:00:27,323 --> 00:00:29,390
weeks' worth
of new computations.

13
00:00:29,392 --> 00:00:32,693
So get the kid
with the two shirts to do it.

14
00:00:34,096 --> 00:00:35,729
Sir, I mean,
if I may,

15
00:00:35,731 --> 00:00:37,931
uh, we've put a lot
of thought and effort

16
00:00:37,933 --> 00:00:40,167
into this current prototype.

17
00:00:40,169 --> 00:00:41,235
It's a really
elegant solution,

18
00:00:41,237 --> 00:00:43,537
and most
importantly, it works.

19
00:00:43,539 --> 00:00:45,305
You both make excellent points.

20
00:00:45,307 --> 00:00:47,107
And thank you for presenting
it so articulately.

21
00:00:47,109 --> 00:00:49,309
Make this.

22
00:00:52,181 --> 00:00:53,647
Champagne,

23
00:00:53,649 --> 00:00:55,082
champagne,
Thank you.

24
00:00:55,084 --> 00:00:57,885
and for the world's tallest
second grader, apple juice.

25
00:00:59,288 --> 00:01:02,523
No bendy straw, some party.

26
00:01:03,592 --> 00:01:04,758
Hey, a-a toast.

27
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:06,126
Thank you all for
your support

28
00:01:06,128 --> 00:01:08,228
while we worked on our
Air Force project.

29
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:09,196
And please know that

30
00:01:09,198 --> 00:01:10,464
we could not have
done it without you,

31
00:01:10,466 --> 00:01:11,365
so cheers.

32
00:01:11,367 --> 00:01:12,733
Cheers.

33
00:01:12,735 --> 00:01:14,334
You know, it's nice of
you to acknowledge us,

34
00:01:14,336 --> 00:01:16,103
but this is your
accomplishment.

35
00:01:16,105 --> 00:01:18,305
Yeah, you guys did
this all on your own.

36
00:01:18,307 --> 00:01:20,007
Without me.

37
00:01:21,677 --> 00:01:23,077
To success without Raj.

38
00:01:25,147 --> 00:01:26,280
So what happens next?

39
00:01:26,282 --> 00:01:27,314
Phase two,

40
00:01:27,316 --> 00:01:28,449
we test it,
perfect it,

41
00:01:28,451 --> 00:01:30,284
and hope to live long
enough to see the movie

42
00:01:30,286 --> 00:01:32,252
based on our lives starring
more attractive versions of us.

43
00:01:33,522 --> 00:01:35,489
Yeah, I'll definitely
live long enough...

44
00:01:35,491 --> 00:01:36,824
vitamin C.

45
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:39,760
First thing tomorrow
morning, we're back at it.

46
00:01:39,762 --> 00:01:41,862
Without me.

47
00:01:41,864 --> 00:01:43,964
I hope his character doesn't
make it into the movie;

48
00:01:43,966 --> 00:01:46,133
he's kind of a bummer.

49
00:01:48,437 --> 00:01:50,537
Leonard Hofstadter.

50
00:01:50,539 --> 00:01:52,172
Access granted.

51
00:01:52,174 --> 00:01:54,475
Hmm. I don't care if this
thing's burning out my retinas;

52
00:01:54,477 --> 00:01:56,143
it makes me feel special.

53
00:01:57,580 --> 00:01:59,580
Now, before we field test,
I think we...

54
00:02:02,451 --> 00:02:04,351
What the hell?

55
00:02:04,353 --> 00:02:05,319
Where is everything?

56
00:02:05,321 --> 00:02:07,321
Who else has access
to this room?

57
00:02:07,323 --> 00:02:09,623
It's a secure lab
in a classified facility;

58
00:02:09,625 --> 00:02:11,525
only the U.S. government and us.

59
00:02:11,527 --> 00:02:13,527
This is very disconcerting.

60
00:02:14,396 --> 00:02:17,131

@elder_man

71
00:02:43,256 --> 00:02:45,837
Sir, I-I-I'm sorry
but I just don't get it.

72
00:02:45,838 --> 00:02:47,638
Y-You came into our lab

73
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:49,707
in the middle of the night
and took our prototype

74
00:02:49,709 --> 00:02:51,742
and all of our research
and didn't even tell us?

75
00:02:51,744 --> 00:02:54,712
Sounds like you get it.

76
00:02:54,714 --> 00:02:57,848
Well, why would
you do that?

77
00:02:57,850 --> 00:03:00,351
You guys completed phase one,
we'll take it from here.

78
00:03:00,353 --> 00:03:02,419
Where did
you move it?

79
00:03:02,421 --> 00:03:03,587
I can't tell you that.

80
00:03:03,589 --> 00:03:06,056
Are you implementing phase two?

81
00:03:06,058 --> 00:03:07,224
I can't tell you that.

82
00:03:07,226 --> 00:03:09,160
Wait, so you're just
going to take all the work

83
00:03:09,162 --> 00:03:12,129
we've done for the last
year and toss us aside?

84
00:03:12,131 --> 00:03:15,533
That one I can tell you, yes.

85
00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:18,969
This is
all very upsetting.

86
00:03:18,971 --> 00:03:20,104
I'm sorry to hear that.

87
00:03:20,106 --> 00:03:21,539
As you know,

88
00:03:21,541 --> 00:03:23,674
the primary focus of
the United States military

89
00:03:23,676 --> 00:03:25,743
is people's feelings.

90
00:03:27,146 --> 00:03:30,581
If that's sarcasm,
please save it for our enemies.

91
00:03:33,252 --> 00:03:34,685
Well, I may be
moving out soon.

92
00:03:34,687 --> 00:03:36,353
I think I found
a place to live.

93
00:03:36,355 --> 00:03:37,988
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

94
00:03:37,990 --> 00:03:39,056
Really?

95
00:03:39,058 --> 00:03:41,592
You kept sending me
apartment listings.

96
00:03:43,729 --> 00:03:45,563
Um... well, I...

97
00:03:45,565 --> 00:03:47,431
yeah, you got me.

98
00:03:48,501 --> 00:03:49,867
Where are you moving?

99
00:03:49,869 --> 00:03:52,236
And when? But a-also where?

100
00:03:52,238 --> 00:03:55,306
Bert has a room for rent.

101
00:03:55,308 --> 00:03:56,774
So you're gonna be
roommates with Bert?

102
00:03:56,776 --> 00:03:58,742
Uh, no, it's, uh,
pretty private, actually,

103
00:03:58,744 --> 00:04:00,110
it's over his garage.

104
00:04:00,112 --> 00:04:02,580
So the only time I'll see him
is when he pulls his car in,

105
00:04:02,582 --> 00:04:05,883
does his laundry or practices
drums in my dining room.

106
00:04:07,153 --> 00:04:08,285
Well, good for you.
Mm-hmm.

107
00:04:08,287 --> 00:04:10,221
I actually have
a little news myself.

108
00:04:10,223 --> 00:04:12,189
Okay, we're just gonna circle
back to when he's moving out?

109
00:04:12,191 --> 00:04:13,324
Okay, that's cool.

110
00:04:14,961 --> 00:04:16,527
I was, uh, asked to be
a visiting researcher

111
00:04:16,529 --> 00:04:17,862
at Princeton.

112
00:04:17,864 --> 00:04:19,864
- Hey, that's amazing.
- Good for you. - Congratulations.

113
00:04:19,866 --> 00:04:21,765
Thanks, but the thing is
I'll be gone for a few months

114
00:04:21,767 --> 00:04:23,500
and I don't know how Sheldon's
gonna feel about that.

115
00:04:23,502 --> 00:04:25,936
Oh, come on, he's a grown man,
he can take care of himself.

116
00:04:25,938 --> 00:04:28,906
You really believe that?

117
00:04:29,775 --> 00:04:32,109
Once again, you got me.

118
00:04:34,914 --> 00:04:37,248
How can you work
on something for a year

119
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:38,649
and they just take it?

120
00:04:38,651 --> 00:04:41,118
I can't believe the Air Force
would treat us like that.

121
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:44,088
You know, I have a good mind
to stop paying my taxes.

122
00:04:44,090 --> 00:04:47,858
It's too bad I enjoy
doing them so much.

123
00:04:51,931 --> 00:04:54,431
The Air Force did it again.

124
00:04:54,433 --> 00:04:57,001
They're erasing our lives!

125
00:04:58,437 --> 00:05:01,005
Third floor,
wrong apartment.

126
00:05:02,642 --> 00:05:04,508
Although, if anyone's gonna
clean out your apartment

127
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:07,645
and disappear,
it'd be Penny.

128
00:05:07,647 --> 00:05:08,779
She might disappear,

129
00:05:08,781 --> 00:05:10,648
but she's definitely
not cleaning anything.

130
00:05:16,956 --> 00:05:18,489
It's okay, everything's here.

131
00:05:19,825 --> 00:05:20,925
Oh, hey,
what's going on?

132
00:05:20,927 --> 00:05:21,859
You won't believe it;

133
00:05:21,861 --> 00:05:24,094
the military
confiscated our project.

134
00:05:24,096 --> 00:05:25,229
What?
You're kidding.

135
00:05:25,231 --> 00:05:26,363
Why would they do that?

136
00:05:26,365 --> 00:05:28,332
They wouldn't say.

137
00:05:28,334 --> 00:05:29,767
I feel so betrayed.

138
00:05:29,769 --> 00:05:32,069
You know, all my life I thought
Uncle Sam was a friendly uncle

139
00:05:32,071 --> 00:05:33,237
who brought you presents.

140
00:05:33,239 --> 00:05:36,340
Turns out he's
the other kind.

141
00:05:37,643 --> 00:05:38,842
Sheldon, I'm so sorry.

142
00:05:38,844 --> 00:05:41,312
Thank you. Can we just
talk about something else?

143
00:05:41,314 --> 00:05:42,680
Yeah, what's going on
with you guys?

144
00:05:42,682 --> 00:05:44,315
Give us some good news.

145
00:05:44,317 --> 00:05:46,050
Amy's got some news.

146
00:05:50,189 --> 00:05:53,057
Yeah, um...

147
00:05:53,059 --> 00:05:55,259
Raj is moving out.

148
00:05:56,362 --> 00:05:57,761
Oh, no.

149
00:05:57,763 --> 00:05:59,897
When?

150
00:06:03,636 --> 00:06:04,735
You doing okay?

151
00:06:04,737 --> 00:06:06,236
Not really.

152
00:06:06,238 --> 00:06:08,605
Want me to put on
some Neil Diamond?

153
00:06:08,607 --> 00:06:10,808
That always makes
you feel better.

154
00:06:10,810 --> 00:06:12,176
No.

155
00:06:12,178 --> 00:06:15,379
Then you'll get all sexed up
and I'm not in the mood.

156
00:06:16,949 --> 00:06:19,216
I mean, an entire
year wasted.

157
00:06:19,218 --> 00:06:22,519
You might be forgetting another
accomplishment of the past year.

158
00:06:22,521 --> 00:06:26,223
Oh. Yeah, yeah, we brought
life into the world.

159
00:06:26,959 --> 00:06:28,359
Really?

160
00:06:28,361 --> 00:06:30,894
That's the importance
you put on us having a baby?

161
00:06:30,896 --> 00:06:33,163
I'm happy about it, but, I mean,
it's not like I did much.

162
00:06:33,165 --> 00:06:34,531
I mean, after
the first three minutes

163
00:06:34,533 --> 00:06:37,134
it was pretty much all you.

164
00:06:40,139 --> 00:06:42,473
So, did you tell him
about Princeton yet?

165
00:06:42,475 --> 00:06:44,541
No, I'm waiting till
he's in a good mood.

166
00:06:44,543 --> 00:06:48,045
Oh, sweetie,
you might not live that long.

167
00:06:49,248 --> 00:06:50,981
I don't know,
maybe I shouldn't go.

168
00:06:50,983 --> 00:06:52,850
Oh, stop it, he'll be fine.

169
00:06:52,852 --> 00:06:55,219
I guess. And he'll have you and
Leonard right across the hall

170
00:06:55,221 --> 00:06:56,553
the whole time.

171
00:06:56,555 --> 00:06:59,356
Oh, damn, wait, you know,
maybe you shouldn't go...

172
00:06:59,358 --> 00:07:00,791
Got to go.

173
00:07:01,427 --> 00:07:02,593
Morning.

174
00:07:03,763 --> 00:07:07,998
I apologize for exceeding
my allotted bathroom time.

175
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,166
Are you feeling okay?

176
00:07:09,168 --> 00:07:10,567
Not really.

177
00:07:10,569 --> 00:07:15,005
Apparently grief can
make one less regular.

178
00:07:15,007 --> 00:07:17,608
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

179
00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:20,978
No, I sat and I sat,
but to no avail.

180
00:07:21,881 --> 00:07:25,149
Oh, the-the more details,
the more sorry.

181
00:07:26,786 --> 00:07:28,485
Well, maybe this'll
cheer you up.

182
00:07:28,487 --> 00:07:30,421
I made your favorite oatmeal...

183
00:07:30,423 --> 00:07:32,823
plain.

184
00:07:33,726 --> 00:07:35,325
What's the occasion?

185
00:07:35,327 --> 00:07:39,129
No occasion, I just wanted
to do something nice for you.

186
00:07:39,131 --> 00:07:41,532
You're so kind.

187
00:07:41,534 --> 00:07:43,801
You know, I don't know how
I ever got by without you.

188
00:07:45,304 --> 00:07:46,737
Oh.

189
00:07:46,739 --> 00:07:49,640
That's sweet, but you...
you did just fine on your own.

190
00:07:50,443 --> 00:07:51,842
Well, I thought that, too,

191
00:07:51,844 --> 00:07:54,945
but I've come to realize, I am
completely dependent on you.

192
00:07:56,816 --> 00:07:59,083
Sheldon, you're,
you're being silly.

193
00:07:59,085 --> 00:08:02,719
No, to wake up every morning
and know you're there

194
00:08:02,721 --> 00:08:04,621
is a great comfort to me.

195
00:08:05,891 --> 00:08:09,593
Mmm, tasteless.

196
00:08:13,232 --> 00:08:15,566
How do you do it?

197
00:08:17,169 --> 00:08:18,702
You know, what you need to do is

198
00:08:18,704 --> 00:08:20,204
put this Air Force
project behind you

199
00:08:20,206 --> 00:08:21,705
and just dive
into something new.

200
00:08:21,707 --> 00:08:25,309
Well, there is our
quantum cognition experiment.

201
00:08:25,311 --> 00:08:27,845
You and I could spend
more time on that.

202
00:08:27,847 --> 00:08:29,880
Oh, I don't know,

203
00:08:29,882 --> 00:08:32,282
I mean, let's say
we succeed in proving

204
00:08:32,284 --> 00:08:33,684
that our consciousness
creates reality.

205
00:08:33,686 --> 00:08:35,352
I mean, what will we have
really accomplished?

206
00:08:35,354 --> 00:08:38,622
You know, a loaf of bread's
still three bucks.

207
00:08:39,492 --> 00:08:41,091
I'm confused.

208
00:08:41,093 --> 00:08:43,594
You're always saying that you
want to spend more time with me.

209
00:08:43,596 --> 00:08:45,963
That is true, I have said that.

210
00:08:45,965 --> 00:08:48,132
Well, a lot, it's very annoying.

211
00:08:49,535 --> 00:08:51,668
Has something changed?

212
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:54,138
Um, is there something
that you're not telling me?

213
00:08:57,443 --> 00:09:01,378
I was offered a summer research
fellowship at Princeton.

214
00:09:03,449 --> 00:09:04,982
Princeton?

215
00:09:04,984 --> 00:09:07,251
A fine institution.

216
00:09:08,554 --> 00:09:10,521
The place where
Albert Einstein taught.

217
00:09:10,523 --> 00:09:12,689
And where Leonard got his PhD,

218
00:09:12,691 --> 00:09:15,459
so it may have gone downhill.

219
00:09:17,329 --> 00:09:19,363
Yeah, that's the one.

220
00:09:19,365 --> 00:09:22,132
Well, that's wonderful.

221
00:09:22,134 --> 00:09:23,500
Congratulations.

222
00:09:23,502 --> 00:09:24,968
Well, I-I haven't
accepted it yet.

223
00:09:24,970 --> 00:09:26,803
I wanted to talk
to you first.

224
00:09:26,805 --> 00:09:27,971
Wh-What is there to talk about?

225
00:09:27,973 --> 00:09:29,606
You have to take it.
It's important.

226
00:09:29,608 --> 00:09:31,408
So are you.

227
00:09:31,410 --> 00:09:32,609
Thank you, but I'll be fine.

228
00:09:32,611 --> 00:09:34,077
Are-are you sure?

229
00:09:34,079 --> 00:09:38,515
Yes. I may have lost my guidance
system and my girlfriend,

230
00:09:38,517 --> 00:09:40,684
but I still have a colon
full of yesterday's meals

231
00:09:40,686 --> 00:09:42,786
to keep me company.

232
00:09:45,824 --> 00:09:47,191
Although, thanks to your
high-fiber breakfast,

233
00:09:47,193 --> 00:09:48,593
I'm sure that'll be
leaving me, too.

234
00:09:53,277 --> 00:09:54,457
Really?

235
00:09:54,458 --> 00:09:56,324
He doesn't put raisins
or banana slices

236
00:09:56,326 --> 00:09:58,794
or anything in it?

237
00:09:59,312 --> 00:10:02,780
I don't think plain oatmeal
was the point of that story.

238
00:10:02,782 --> 00:10:04,281
I mean, I like a
little brown sugar...

239
00:10:04,283 --> 00:10:07,718
Guys.

240
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:09,286
You're still
gonna go, right?

241
00:10:09,288 --> 00:10:10,254
I don't know.

242
00:10:10,256 --> 00:10:12,456
Sheldon's so vulnerable
right now.

243
00:10:12,458 --> 00:10:14,058
Oh, come on. Look,
if the roles were reversed,

244
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:15,859
he'd be on the first train
to New Jersey,

245
00:10:15,861 --> 00:10:19,196
or the second train if there
were teenagers on the first one.

246
00:10:19,198 --> 00:10:22,166
Well, distance
might be nice.

247
00:10:22,168 --> 00:10:24,068
The last time a big project
ended for Howie,

248
00:10:24,070 --> 00:10:25,936
he wouldn't stop
following me around.

249
00:10:25,938 --> 00:10:27,938
He even went with me
to get a mammogram.

250
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:29,607
Well, what's wrong with that?

251
00:10:29,609 --> 00:10:31,342
No, he wanted
to get one with me,

252
00:10:31,344 --> 00:10:34,478
like some kind of weird
couple's massage.

253
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:37,348
And yet you bore his child.
Neato.

254
00:10:39,352 --> 00:10:42,086
You're excited about
this opportunity, right?

255
00:10:42,088 --> 00:10:44,288
Of course. I get to be part
of the first team

256
00:10:44,290 --> 00:10:46,824
to use radon markers
to map the structures that...

257
00:10:46,826 --> 00:10:49,593
Okay, a simple yes will do.

258
00:10:49,595 --> 00:10:50,928
You have to go.

259
00:10:50,930 --> 00:10:53,297
I know, but what
if Sheldon...

260
00:10:53,299 --> 00:10:55,132
Okay, listen to me.
Your relationship can handle

261
00:10:55,134 --> 00:10:56,200
being long distance for a while.

262
00:10:56,202 --> 00:10:58,002
It's not like you two
are very physical.

263
00:10:58,004 --> 00:11:00,437
Hey, you don't know what
goes on behind closed doors.

264
00:11:00,439 --> 00:11:01,639
A lot of lectures?

265
00:11:01,641 --> 00:11:02,706
All right, so you know.

266
00:11:03,909 --> 00:11:05,943
I'm telling you,
if you don't go

267
00:11:05,945 --> 00:11:07,077
you'll end up
regretting it.

268
00:11:07,079 --> 00:11:08,078
Hey!

269
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:10,514
Wait up!
Oh, great.

270
00:11:12,418 --> 00:11:14,551
You left something at home.

271
00:11:14,553 --> 00:11:15,586
A big hug!
Oh!

272
00:11:17,857 --> 00:11:20,090
I found it right next
to these kisses.

273
00:11:21,727 --> 00:11:23,027
It's too late for me.

274
00:11:23,029 --> 00:11:24,695
Save yourself.

275
00:11:27,033 --> 00:11:29,800
So, are you excited to have
your own place again?

276
00:11:29,802 --> 00:11:32,269
I am, but I'll miss you guys.

277
00:11:32,271 --> 00:11:33,637
Ah, we'll miss you, too.

278
00:11:33,639 --> 00:11:37,274
Wha... you could try
saying that without smiling.

279
00:11:37,276 --> 00:11:40,744
I'm trying. This is
the best I can do.

280
00:11:50,256 --> 00:11:51,455
What are you doing?

281
00:11:51,457 --> 00:11:53,757
What does it look like?

282
00:11:53,759 --> 00:11:56,460
I'm playing sad harmonica...

283
00:11:56,462 --> 00:11:59,163
in an apartment
as empty as my heart.

284
00:11:59,165 --> 00:12:01,365
Why?

285
00:12:01,367 --> 00:12:03,967
I got the blues.

286
00:12:03,969 --> 00:12:06,103
My baby done left me.

287
00:12:06,105 --> 00:12:09,239
Come on, Sheldon.

288
00:12:09,241 --> 00:12:11,341
Amy's only gone
for a few months.

289
00:12:11,343 --> 00:12:13,877
And now that I'm moving out,
your old room is empty,

290
00:12:13,879 --> 00:12:15,345
so you can stay there
whenever you want.

291
00:12:15,347 --> 00:12:18,148
Uh, could I talk to you
in the hall for a sec?

292
00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:19,483
Yeah, sure.

293
00:12:25,725 --> 00:12:27,024
Sheldon, you're being silly.

294
00:12:27,026 --> 00:12:28,692
Am I?

295
00:12:28,694 --> 00:12:30,761
Yesterday
I had an Air Force project,

296
00:12:30,763 --> 00:12:32,062
a girlfriend who lived with me,

297
00:12:32,064 --> 00:12:35,299
and my good friend Raj
right across the hall.

298
00:12:35,301 --> 00:12:37,634
Do you really care
about that last one?

299
00:12:37,636 --> 00:12:40,971
No, but that list was sounding
a little thin.

300
00:12:40,973 --> 00:12:44,441
Instead of dwelling on the
negative, think about this.

301
00:12:44,443 --> 00:12:47,478
Your girlfriend was given
an amazing opportunity,

302
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:49,346
which gives you
an opportunity

303
00:12:49,348 --> 00:12:52,649
to show her that you're a loving
and supportive boyfriend.

304
00:12:53,486 --> 00:12:56,620
So trick her.

305
00:12:57,456 --> 00:13:00,324
All right, let me start again.

306
00:13:00,326 --> 00:13:02,793
Uh... you and Amy...

307
00:13:02,795 --> 00:13:04,027
Can I get my stuff?

308
00:13:04,029 --> 00:13:07,397
Sounds like it's
gonna be a while.

309
00:13:13,472 --> 00:13:15,939
I missed you.

310
00:13:15,941 --> 00:13:18,075
Come here, let's talk.

311
00:13:18,077 --> 00:13:20,344
Ooh. Sounds serious.

312
00:13:20,346 --> 00:13:21,779
Have I been a bad boy?

313
00:13:21,781 --> 00:13:22,813
Am I gonna get a spanking

314
00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:25,783
'cause you know I...
Just listen.

315
00:13:25,785 --> 00:13:27,785
I don't know if
you realize this,

316
00:13:27,787 --> 00:13:30,854
but whenever you're
between projects,

317
00:13:30,856 --> 00:13:33,323
you tend to get a
little insecure.

318
00:13:33,325 --> 00:13:34,892
Oh.
A little clingy.

319
00:13:34,894 --> 00:13:37,427
I know and I'm sorry.

320
00:13:37,429 --> 00:13:39,429
Oh, oh, oh, okay, stop.

321
00:13:39,431 --> 00:13:41,999
Stop.

322
00:13:42,001 --> 00:13:43,934
I love when you're
affectionate,

323
00:13:43,936 --> 00:13:46,370
but this is not coming
from a good place.

324
00:13:46,372 --> 00:13:48,272
Well, excuse me,

325
00:13:48,274 --> 00:13:50,641
but what did you do when you
worked on that allergy drug

326
00:13:50,643 --> 00:13:53,310
for two years and the FDA
shut down your project?

327
00:13:53,312 --> 00:13:57,748
I signed us up for
ballroom dance class.

328
00:13:58,584 --> 00:14:00,884
Okay, and what did you do

329
00:14:00,886 --> 00:14:03,720
when they took you
off the antifungal team?

330
00:14:03,722 --> 00:14:07,758
I made us have a baby.

331
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:10,961
So?

332
00:14:10,963 --> 00:14:12,796
Bring it in.

333
00:14:14,934 --> 00:14:18,936
And now the movie
just got rated "R."

334
00:14:22,474 --> 00:14:23,707
Hey.

335
00:14:23,709 --> 00:14:25,309
You going somewhere?

336
00:14:25,311 --> 00:14:30,647
No, but you are, so I got
you this as a present.

337
00:14:30,649 --> 00:14:32,950
Sheldon, that isn't necessary.

338
00:14:32,952 --> 00:14:34,251
No, it is.

339
00:14:34,253 --> 00:14:35,619
Leonard pointed out to me

340
00:14:35,621 --> 00:14:38,455
that I'm not always a loving
and supportive boyfriend,

341
00:14:38,457 --> 00:14:42,826
so here's some
quality luggage.

342
00:14:42,828 --> 00:14:44,928
Thank you.

343
00:14:44,930 --> 00:14:47,731
The salesman said it could
survive a plane crash, so...

344
00:14:50,102 --> 00:14:53,003
Perhaps you should fly
inside it.

345
00:14:57,276 --> 00:14:59,643
Does this mean you're
okay with me going?

346
00:14:59,645 --> 00:15:01,678
Well, I'm not looking
forward to it,

347
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:04,214
but it is a wonderful
opportunity

348
00:15:04,216 --> 00:15:06,049
and you need to take it.

349
00:15:06,051 --> 00:15:08,252
Besides, Princeton
is in New Jersey,

350
00:15:08,254 --> 00:15:11,688
so it's not like you're
gonna want to stay.

351
00:15:17,229 --> 00:15:20,197
Uh, I know it's
not your birthday,

352
00:15:20,199 --> 00:15:21,164
but if you're
interested...

353
00:15:21,166 --> 00:15:22,799
I am.
Okay.

354
00:15:24,770 --> 00:15:26,837
Oh, and just to be clear,

355
00:15:26,839 --> 00:15:30,507
I'm not being intimate with you
in order to keep you from going.

356
00:15:30,509 --> 00:15:32,476
I wasn't thinking that.

357
00:15:32,478 --> 00:15:34,978
Well, no, it's just, I'm
just warning you, you know,

358
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:37,381
if you find yourself
3,000 miles away

359
00:15:37,383 --> 00:15:40,150
and craving a-a hit
of this, you know...

360
00:15:41,387 --> 00:15:44,421
I can't Skype it to you.

361
00:15:44,423 --> 00:15:48,825
That's a risk
I'm willing to take.

362
00:15:48,827 --> 00:15:50,360
All right, then.

363
00:15:50,362 --> 00:15:54,364
Let's go to the bedroom,
remove our clothes,

364
00:15:54,366 --> 00:15:55,699
fold them neatly...

365
00:15:57,336 --> 00:16:01,171
and engage in
frenzied lovemaking.

366
00:16:03,876 --> 00:16:06,343
What if we don't fold
our clothes at all?

367
00:16:06,345 --> 00:16:08,879
I d... or...

368
00:16:08,881 --> 00:16:11,515
what if we fold them?

369
00:16:13,719 --> 00:16:15,018
Well, here's your key back.

370
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:16,486
Thank you.

371
00:16:16,488 --> 00:16:18,355
As soon as I have the place set
up I'm gonna have you guys over.

372
00:16:18,357 --> 00:16:20,223
Oh, we would love that.

373
00:16:20,225 --> 00:16:21,591
I really can't thank you
enough for taking me in.

374
00:16:21,593 --> 00:16:24,928
You know, I was in a pretty
low place in my life, and...

375
00:16:24,930 --> 00:16:28,865
Oh, Amy,
you naughty vixen.

376
00:16:32,871 --> 00:16:36,440
Anyway, uh,
as I was saying,

377
00:16:36,442 --> 00:16:39,209
I was at a pretty low place
in my life and, uh,

378
00:16:39,211 --> 00:16:40,744
if it wasn't for friends
like you...

379
00:16:40,746 --> 00:16:42,212
My goodness,
that form of stimulation

380
00:16:42,214 --> 00:16:43,413
is highly efficient.

381
00:16:47,953 --> 00:16:50,253
I can't compete
with that. Bye.

382
00:16:52,791 --> 00:16:54,558
Should we give them
their privacy?

383
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:58,261
I want to,
but I don't think I can.

384
00:16:58,263 --> 00:17:00,230
Whoopee!
Okay, I'm good now.

385
00:17:06,695 --> 00:17:08,328
Okay, the car is waiting.

386
00:17:08,330 --> 00:17:09,930
Do you want
to walk me downstairs?

387
00:17:09,932 --> 00:17:11,031
Of course.

388
00:17:11,033 --> 00:17:12,666
Here, here, let me.

389
00:17:12,668 --> 00:17:14,935
I've been doing a little
research on New Jersey,

390
00:17:14,937 --> 00:17:16,503
and I was delighted to learn

391
00:17:16,505 --> 00:17:18,739
that their chief
agricultural product

392
00:17:18,741 --> 00:17:20,574
is sod.

393
00:17:20,576 --> 00:17:23,076
- Is it?
- Hmm, yes.

394
00:17:23,078 --> 00:17:28,115
Yeah, perhaps I've been harder
on them than they deserve.

395
00:17:28,117 --> 00:17:30,150
Do you think it's possible

396
00:17:30,152 --> 00:17:33,420
you might enjoy being
on your own for a little while?

397
00:17:33,422 --> 00:17:35,155
It's hard to say.

398
00:17:35,157 --> 00:17:37,157
I've never really lived
by myself.

399
00:17:37,159 --> 00:17:40,627
What if I become
strange and eccentric?

400
00:17:45,267 --> 00:17:46,967
I'll love you no matter what.

401
00:17:48,470 --> 00:17:52,372
Howard Hughes saved his
urine in milk bottles.

402
00:17:54,276 --> 00:17:57,677
We'll cross that bridge
when we come to it.

403
00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:00,374
And you'll text me when
you arrive at the airport?

404
00:18:00,398 --> 00:18:01,215
I will.

405
00:18:01,216 --> 00:18:02,949
- And when you're at the gate?
- Uh-huh.

406
00:18:02,951 --> 00:18:04,651
And if you see any actors
from Game of Thrones

407
00:18:04,653 --> 00:18:06,686
in first class?

408
00:18:06,688 --> 00:18:08,772
I don't know what they
look like, but sure.

409
00:18:08,796 --> 00:18:09,357
Oh.

410
00:18:09,358 --> 00:18:11,353
And don't forget to Skype
me when you arrive.

411
00:18:11,377 --> 00:18:11,993
I won't.

412
00:18:11,994 --> 00:18:13,393
- And every morning.
- Got it.

413
00:18:13,395 --> 00:18:15,629
Now of course, my
9:00 a.m. is your noon,

414
00:18:15,631 --> 00:18:17,197
so let's avoid the
whole "good morning,"

415
00:18:17,199 --> 00:18:18,298
"good afternoon" minefield,

416
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:20,133
and let's just say,
"Hello."

417
00:18:20,135 --> 00:18:22,068
Good thinking.

418
00:18:22,070 --> 00:18:24,137
And just remember,
I am proud of you

419
00:18:24,139 --> 00:18:27,240
and I support you
in all that you do.

420
00:18:27,242 --> 00:18:29,009
Thank you.
That means a lot.

421
00:18:29,011 --> 00:18:30,277
Oh, and one last thing.

422
00:18:30,279 --> 00:18:32,746
If you find yourself working
with a male scientist

423
00:18:32,748 --> 00:18:36,817
who's as smart as me, as tall
as me and has hair like Thor,

424
00:18:36,819 --> 00:18:39,386
well, then I want you to
step away from the situation

425
00:18:39,388 --> 00:18:40,388
and call me immediately.

426
00:18:42,222 --> 00:18:49,022
