00:00:01,529 --> 00:00:02,579
Previously on:

2
00:00:03,545 --> 00:00:05,262
So, what have you
been up to?

3
00:00:05,264 --> 00:00:07,047
I started a new
software company

4
00:00:07,049 --> 00:00:08,815
with my old partner
Billy Stanhope.

5
00:00:08,817 --> 00:00:11,000
You really think we can finally
build the electric suitcase?

6
00:00:11,002 --> 00:00:12,719
Yes. We have the technology now.

7
00:00:12,721 --> 00:00:14,337
Something you should know.

8
00:00:14,339 --> 00:00:15,772
It's about your ex-wife.

9
00:00:15,774 --> 00:00:16,890
What, Bridget?

10
00:00:16,892 --> 00:00:18,475
Yeah. I'm, uh...

11
00:00:18,477 --> 00:00:20,110
kind of sleeping with her.

12
00:00:20,112 --> 00:00:21,862
What?
Wait! Hey!

13
00:00:24,866 --> 00:00:26,249
Morning.

14
00:00:26,251 --> 00:00:29,352
It's 2:00 p.m.

15
00:00:29,354 --> 00:00:30,353
So?

16
00:00:30,355 --> 00:00:32,038
It's Saturday; I slept in.

17
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:33,907
It's Sunday.

18
00:00:33,909 --> 00:00:35,575
Really?

19
00:00:35,577 --> 00:00:36,960
That's disturbing.

20
00:00:36,962 --> 00:00:40,697
So what did you do last night
that you had to sleep all day?

21
00:00:40,699 --> 00:00:42,048
One thing at a time.

22
00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:45,001
I'm still trying to figure out
what happened to Saturday.

23
00:00:45,003 --> 00:00:47,387
Jake, you're gonna graduate
high school in a few days.

24
00:00:47,389 --> 00:00:48,505
Don't you think it's time

25
00:00:48,507 --> 00:00:49,806
to start getting
your life together?

26
00:00:49,808 --> 00:00:51,341
I will if you will.

27
00:00:51,343 --> 00:00:52,843
What?

28
00:00:52,845 --> 00:00:55,211
I will certainly
consider that, Father.

29
00:00:55,213 --> 00:00:56,396
This is serious.

30
00:00:56,398 --> 00:00:58,181
You will never amount to
anything if you sleep all day.

31
00:00:58,183 --> 00:00:59,382
Morning.

32
00:01:04,021 --> 00:01:05,989
I'm sorry, I was distracted

33
00:01:05,991 --> 00:01:07,824
by the naked billionaire
that just woke up.

34
00:01:07,826 --> 00:01:11,411
Shut up and eat
your damn cereal.

Original Air Date on May 14, 2012

== sync, corrected by elderman ==

39
00:01:29,234 --> 00:01:32,125
Man, I did not think Jeremy
was ever gonna stop talking.

40
00:01:32,126 --> 00:01:33,493
Yeah.

41
00:01:33,495 --> 00:01:36,962
That guy really puts the "dict"
in "valedictorian."

42
00:01:36,964 --> 00:01:39,649
Thinks he's so great just
'cause he's going to Harvard.

43
00:01:39,651 --> 00:01:41,184
Where is Harvard anyway?

44
00:01:41,186 --> 00:01:44,320
Dude, didn't you learn
anything in high school?

45
00:01:44,322 --> 00:01:47,156
It's the capital of Connecticut.

46
00:01:47,158 --> 00:01:49,141
Are you sure?

47
00:01:49,143 --> 00:01:50,159
Yeah.

48
00:01:50,161 --> 00:01:51,677
Harvard, Connecticut.

49
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:54,780
What'd you think
was the capital of Connecticut?

50
00:01:54,782 --> 00:01:56,815
"C."

51
00:01:59,704 --> 00:02:01,170
You're an idiot.

52
00:02:01,172 --> 00:02:03,155
I don't know why
I hang out with you.

53
00:02:03,157 --> 00:02:04,190
'Cause you're gay.

54
00:02:04,192 --> 00:02:05,508
Well, what does that make you?

55
00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:07,760
Attractive.

56
00:02:10,097 --> 00:02:12,882
So are your parents giving you
a hard time about your "future"?

57
00:02:12,884 --> 00:02:13,999
Oh, yeah.

58
00:02:14,001 --> 00:02:15,268
Both my mom and my dad.

59
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:16,686
I'm sick of hearing it.

60
00:02:16,688 --> 00:02:19,939
Yeah. "If you're not going to
college, you need to get a job"

61
00:02:19,941 --> 00:02:22,391
Where do they
get this stuff?

62
00:02:22,393 --> 00:02:24,560
Beats me.

63
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:30,015
So what are we gonna do?

64
00:02:30,017 --> 00:02:32,118
About what?

65
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,870
Our future.

66
00:02:33,872 --> 00:02:35,688
Oh.

67
00:02:37,524 --> 00:02:41,010
I could go for
some frozen yogurt.

68
00:02:41,012 --> 00:02:42,328
Good idea, man.

69
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:43,379
Let's go.

70
00:02:43,381 --> 00:02:45,748
Should we take
our robes off?

71
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:46,916
No, no, leave them on.

72
00:02:46,918 --> 00:02:49,135
They'll attract smart chicks.

73
00:02:51,588 --> 00:02:54,257
Come on, Judith.
He's your son too.

74
00:02:54,259 --> 00:02:58,060
I have videotape of him
shooting out of your body.

75
00:02:58,929 --> 00:03:00,680
Yes, I've talked to him

76
00:03:00,682 --> 00:03:03,482
about his lack of plans,
but it's like talking to a wall.

77
00:03:03,484 --> 00:03:07,904
A very good-natured,
but dense wall.

78
00:03:07,906 --> 00:03:12,358
Of course I'm concerned,
but what do you want me to do?

79
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:15,728
No, I'm not gonna ask Walden
to give him a job.

80
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:19,282
Because it would
be an imposition.

81
00:03:19,284 --> 00:03:23,920
Yes, more of an imposition
than me living there for free.

82
00:03:23,922 --> 00:03:27,206
Okay, okay, if it'll get you
to shut up, I'll ask him.

83
00:03:29,176 --> 00:03:32,578
She's never
gonna shut up.

84
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:33,579
Okay, okay.

85
00:03:33,581 --> 00:03:34,913
Good-bye, Judith.

86
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:38,935
I am so thankful
I have you in my life.

87
00:03:38,937 --> 00:03:41,053
What about my son?

88
00:03:41,055 --> 00:03:42,588
What about him?

89
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:45,424
You're gonna ask Walden for a
job for Jake, but not Eldridge?

90
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:48,694
Of course not.

91
00:03:48,696 --> 00:03:51,714
I was just gonna hold Eldridge
back to sweeten the deal.

92
00:03:57,204 --> 00:03:59,522
I have a question.

93
00:03:59,524 --> 00:04:00,856
What?

94
00:04:00,858 --> 00:04:04,076
Why didn't you order
adjustable chairs?

95
00:04:04,078 --> 00:04:06,462
I did.

96
00:04:06,464 --> 00:04:08,447
Mine's adjustable.

97
00:04:08,449 --> 00:04:09,548
Well, wait.

98
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:10,949
How'd you do that?

99
00:04:10,951 --> 00:04:13,669
This lever right here.

100
00:04:13,671 --> 00:04:15,504
I don't have a lever.

101
00:04:15,506 --> 00:04:16,922
Hmm?

102
00:04:16,924 --> 00:04:19,258
Well, that's too bad,
you being so short and all.

103
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:22,511
You did this to get back at me.

104
00:04:22,513 --> 00:04:23,929
I don't know
what you're talking about.

105
00:04:23,931 --> 00:04:25,815
For sleeping with your ex-wife.

106
00:04:25,817 --> 00:04:28,918
Do you really think
that I am so petty

107
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:32,938
that I would pay a chair
manufacturer an extra $480

108
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:37,276
to remove the adjustable
height feature?

109
00:04:37,278 --> 00:04:40,646
That is crazy talk.

110
00:04:41,832 --> 00:04:45,251
How's everything down there
at the Lollipop Guild?

111
00:04:49,339 --> 00:04:50,923
Hey, guys.

112
00:04:50,925 --> 00:04:52,208
Am I interrupting?

113
00:04:52,210 --> 00:04:53,092
Hey, Alan.

114
00:04:53,094 --> 00:04:54,710
Just thought
I'd bring you by

115
00:04:54,712 --> 00:04:57,179
a little office-warming
dieffenbachia.

116
00:04:57,181 --> 00:04:59,598
Ah, thank you.

117
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,550
Looks like you got the place
up and running.

118
00:05:01,552 --> 00:05:02,802
We're getting there.

119
00:05:02,804 --> 00:05:04,169
Electric Suitcase, Inc.

120
00:05:04,171 --> 00:05:08,006
Very, very impressive.

121
00:05:09,476 --> 00:05:11,093
What can I do for you?

122
00:05:11,095 --> 00:05:13,646
Oh, nothing. I just came
to drop off my gift

123
00:05:13,648 --> 00:05:14,980
and wish you well.

124
00:05:14,982 --> 00:05:16,282
Okay.

125
00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:19,318
Okay, well, I'll get out
of your hair.

126
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:21,620
Uh, nice to see
you again.

127
00:05:21,622 --> 00:05:23,706
Yep. Always thrill.

128
00:05:24,875 --> 00:05:26,075
Oh, there is one thing.

129
00:05:26,077 --> 00:05:28,461
Here we go.
Here we go.

130
00:05:28,463 --> 00:05:31,630
Um, you know Jake
just graduated high school.

131
00:05:31,632 --> 00:05:33,749
Oh, hey, I'm sorry I couldn't
make it to the ceremony.

132
00:05:33,751 --> 00:05:35,551
Oh, don't be silly.
No one expected you to.

133
00:05:35,553 --> 00:05:36,702
You know what?
Here...

134
00:05:36,704 --> 00:05:39,755
why don't you give this
to him for me.

135
00:05:39,757 --> 00:05:41,557
Ooh, a hundred dollars.

136
00:05:41,559 --> 00:05:44,076
I will make sure he gets this.

137
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:49,682
What? I-I don't
even know the kid.

138
00:05:49,684 --> 00:05:51,183
Oh, of course not.

139
00:05:51,185 --> 00:05:53,319
Um, anyway, I was
just wondering, um,

140
00:05:53,321 --> 00:05:56,388
since you've started
this exciting venture

141
00:05:56,390 --> 00:05:57,890
and obviously you're hiring,

142
00:05:57,892 --> 00:06:00,576
that there might be
an opportunity here for Jake.

143
00:06:01,394 --> 00:06:02,862
He's not going to college?

144
00:06:02,864 --> 00:06:04,997
Not unless he's
delivering pizzas.

145
00:06:04,999 --> 00:06:06,615
Uh, probably true,

146
00:06:06,617 --> 00:06:08,233
but he has a good heart,

147
00:06:08,235 --> 00:06:10,569
and I'm afraid if I
can't find him a decent job,

148
00:06:10,571 --> 00:06:12,254
he might have to sell it.

149
00:06:12,256 --> 00:06:14,373
Okay, listen, Alan, I'm sorry.

150
00:06:14,375 --> 00:06:15,791
I-I like Jake,

151
00:06:15,793 --> 00:06:19,211
but I just don't think
we have anything for him here.

152
00:06:19,213 --> 00:06:20,463
Oh, oh, okay.

153
00:06:20,465 --> 00:06:22,681
I understand.
You know, he's just my kid.

154
00:06:22,683 --> 00:06:24,049
Our future. But, um,

155
00:06:24,051 --> 00:06:26,719
but thanks anyway.

156
00:06:26,721 --> 00:06:27,937
Oh, wait, wait.
Hold it, hold it.

157
00:06:27,939 --> 00:06:29,271
Yeah? Yeah?

158
00:06:29,273 --> 00:06:32,308
Does he know anything
about computers at all?

159
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:34,860
Not per se,
but he is eager to learn.

160
00:06:34,862 --> 00:06:37,696
He's like a sponge when it comes
to soaking up information.

161
00:06:37,698 --> 00:06:40,266
No, he isn't.

162
00:06:40,268 --> 00:06:42,601
Will you at least give me
the sponge part?

163
00:06:42,603 --> 00:06:44,286
Yeah, if you lay him
on a wet spot,

164
00:06:44,288 --> 00:06:46,205
he might absorb liquid.

165
00:06:47,273 --> 00:06:48,991
Why are you being
such a jerk, man?

166
00:06:48,993 --> 00:06:50,326
Let's give
the boy a shot.

167
00:06:50,328 --> 00:06:51,544
Billy,

168
00:06:51,546 --> 00:06:53,746
I've seen this kid spend
an entire afternoon

169
00:06:53,748 --> 00:06:56,949
smoking dope and trying
to lick his own nipples.

170
00:06:56,951 --> 00:07:00,586
Who amongst us
hasn't... done...

171
00:07:00,588 --> 00:07:03,756
Look, we will...
we will take him on, okay?

172
00:07:03,758 --> 00:07:06,759
Billy...
He'll be my responsibility.

173
00:07:06,761 --> 00:07:08,344
Oh, thank you so much.
You will not regret it.

174
00:07:08,346 --> 00:07:12,097
Yes, you will.
I will send him right over.

175
00:07:12,099 --> 00:07:13,399
Oh, one more thing,

176
00:07:13,401 --> 00:07:15,684
uh, my girlfriend's son
needs a job too,

177
00:07:15,686 --> 00:07:17,102
but you're gonna love him,
he's...

178
00:07:17,104 --> 00:07:18,487
blonde. Bye.

179
00:07:20,590 --> 00:07:22,641
Okay, I'm telling you
right now,

180
00:07:22,643 --> 00:07:25,244
this is a bad idea.

181
00:07:27,330 --> 00:07:28,831
How did you do that?

182
00:07:28,833 --> 00:07:31,283
I don't know what
you're talking about.

183
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:38,457
Okay, fellas...

184
00:07:38,459 --> 00:07:40,125
this is the heart and soul

185
00:07:40,127 --> 00:07:41,794
of The Electric Suitcase.

186
00:07:41,796 --> 00:07:43,328
300 state of the art,

187
00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:45,014
high bandwidth servers

188
00:07:45,016 --> 00:07:46,832
all working
in tandem.

189
00:07:46,834 --> 00:07:48,434
Cool.
Awesome.

190
00:07:48,436 --> 00:07:49,685
Any questions so far?

191
00:07:49,687 --> 00:07:51,169
Uh, yeah.
Is there a cafeteria

192
00:07:51,171 --> 00:07:52,771
or do we order in?

193
00:07:54,024 --> 00:07:56,225
There's a cafeteria
on the 14th floor.

194
00:07:56,227 --> 00:07:57,943
Oh. Cool.
I got a question.

195
00:07:57,945 --> 00:07:58,644
Yes?

196
00:07:58,646 --> 00:08:00,178
Do they have donuts?

197
00:08:01,347 --> 00:08:03,315
Was I lying?

198
00:08:03,317 --> 00:08:06,285
I don't know if I have donuts.

199
00:08:06,287 --> 00:08:08,704
That's okay.
It's not a deal-breaker.

200
00:08:08,706 --> 00:08:09,955
Glad to hear it.

201
00:08:09,957 --> 00:08:11,207
Uh, okay, guys...

202
00:08:11,209 --> 00:08:13,542
all you have to do
between now

203
00:08:13,544 --> 00:08:15,044
and 8:00 tomorrow morning,

204
00:08:15,046 --> 00:08:19,248
is watch the lights
on these servers, all right?

205
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:20,466
If a green goes to red,

206
00:08:20,468 --> 00:08:22,184
it means the drive
is about to fail

207
00:08:22,186 --> 00:08:23,335
so all you do...

208
00:08:23,337 --> 00:08:25,471
you pop it out

209
00:08:25,473 --> 00:08:27,139
and you replace it

210
00:08:27,141 --> 00:08:29,541
with a fresh one
from right here.

211
00:08:29,543 --> 00:08:31,310
Got it. No problem.
All right.

212
00:08:31,312 --> 00:08:34,113
Oh, and there's no smoking dope
in this building.

213
00:08:34,115 --> 00:08:35,547
No, sir.
Absolutely not.

214
00:08:35,549 --> 00:08:38,067
Not inside the building.

215
00:08:38,069 --> 00:08:40,352
Or outside the building.

216
00:08:40,354 --> 00:08:41,921
How about the roof?

217
00:08:41,923 --> 00:08:43,188
No.

218
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:45,090
What about before
we come to work?

219
00:08:45,092 --> 00:08:46,091
No!

220
00:08:46,093 --> 00:08:47,626
What about brownies?

221
00:08:47,628 --> 00:08:50,663
There's no pot, period!

222
00:08:50,665 --> 00:08:54,066
No brownies, no God, no roof,
no outside, no inside.

223
00:08:54,068 --> 00:08:56,168
No problem.
All right.

224
00:08:57,170 --> 00:08:58,320
Good.

225
00:08:58,322 --> 00:09:00,589
Oh, and we just want
to take this opportunity

226
00:09:00,591 --> 00:09:02,925
to thank you both for
this great opportunity.

227
00:09:02,927 --> 00:09:05,261
'Cause let's face it,
it is an opportunity.

228
00:09:05,263 --> 00:09:07,763
And it's great.
Opportunity.

229
00:09:07,765 --> 00:09:10,683
Remember, this is on you.

230
00:09:12,102 --> 00:09:13,102
Oh, and on a personal note,

231
00:09:13,104 --> 00:09:14,436
thank you
for the graduation money.

232
00:09:14,438 --> 00:09:16,238
It's my pleasure.

233
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,774
A kid my age can always
use an extra 50 bucks.

234
00:09:24,114 --> 00:09:25,648
You know,

235
00:09:25,650 --> 00:09:28,233
I kind of like this whole
"working for a living" thing.

236
00:09:28,235 --> 00:09:29,685
It feels good, you know?

237
00:09:29,687 --> 00:09:31,036
Responsible, grownup.

238
00:09:31,038 --> 00:09:32,388
Absolutely.

239
00:09:32,390 --> 00:09:35,374
All right, we have
successfully downloaded

240
00:09:35,376 --> 00:09:37,993
40,000 hours of porn.

241
00:09:37,995 --> 00:09:40,746
That's a lot to watch
two minutes at a time.

242
00:09:40,748 --> 00:09:42,564
I just hope Billy
and Walden don't notice

243
00:09:42,566 --> 00:09:44,316
that we're using
their hard drives.

244
00:09:44,318 --> 00:09:47,086
Don't worry. I've labeled
every movie "personal."

245
00:09:47,088 --> 00:09:48,721
Oh. Good thinking.

246
00:09:48,723 --> 00:09:51,140
Oh, red light. I got it.

247
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:55,778
Nicely done.

248
00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:58,130
We got this job nailed, my man.
Yeah.

249
00:09:58,132 --> 00:09:59,264
And the best part is,

250
00:09:59,266 --> 00:10:01,333
we are in on the ground floor
of the company.

251
00:10:01,335 --> 00:10:03,352
Oh, another one.

252
00:10:03,354 --> 00:10:04,687
Allow me.

253
00:10:04,689 --> 00:10:07,106
Maybe they'll give us
stock options and we'll be rich.

254
00:10:07,108 --> 00:10:08,524
What exactly is a stock option?

255
00:10:08,526 --> 00:10:10,743
It's a call option on the
common stock of a company,

256
00:10:10,745 --> 00:10:12,861
issued as a form
of cash compensation.

257
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:14,146
If the company stock rises,

258
00:10:14,148 --> 00:10:15,748
the holder of the option

259
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:18,334
generally experiences
a direct financial benefit.

260
00:10:18,336 --> 00:10:20,436
Where'd you learn that?

261
00:10:20,438 --> 00:10:23,488
Wikipedia.
It's not just for term papers.

262
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:26,508
The point is,
we're gonna be rich.

263
00:10:26,510 --> 00:10:28,093
Oh, another one.

264
00:10:28,095 --> 00:10:30,662
Cool. So we'll have
our own planes

265
00:10:30,664 --> 00:10:32,765
and yachts and chicks.

266
00:10:32,767 --> 00:10:34,633
And tons of pot.
Chicks with pot.

267
00:10:34,635 --> 00:10:35,851
Chicks with pot in bikinis.

268
00:10:35,853 --> 00:10:37,136
Naked chicks with pot.

269
00:10:37,138 --> 00:10:38,303
On a yacht.

270
00:10:38,305 --> 00:10:40,489
I like that a lot.

271
00:10:40,491 --> 00:10:41,557
Uh-oh.

272
00:10:41,559 --> 00:10:43,242
That's not good.

273
00:10:43,244 --> 00:10:45,251
Yeah. Why are they all
going bad at the same time?

274
00:10:45,276 --> 00:10:46,312
I don't know.

275
00:10:46,313 --> 00:10:48,063
It's like there's
some sort of virus.

276
00:10:48,065 --> 00:10:50,348
Like the kind you get
when you download too much...

277
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:52,351
Uh-oh.
Uh-oh.

278
00:10:53,370 --> 00:10:54,470
Maybe we should call Billy!

279
00:10:54,472 --> 00:10:56,354
No, we can do this!

280
00:10:58,308 --> 00:10:59,858
Okay, we can't do this.

281
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:02,144
Call Billy!
Call Billy!

282
00:11:02,146 --> 00:11:03,662
Hello?

283
00:11:03,664 --> 00:11:05,381
Billy, it's Jake.

284
00:11:09,535 --> 00:11:11,587
I just want to start once again

285
00:11:11,589 --> 00:11:14,173
by saying how grateful we are
for this opportunity.

286
00:11:14,175 --> 00:11:15,557
It's great.

287
00:11:28,668 --> 00:11:32,237
How did this happen?

288
00:11:32,239 --> 00:11:34,455
Oh, I... I don't know.

289
00:11:34,457 --> 00:11:38,076
Well, faulty wiring
or, uh, cheap hardware...

290
00:11:38,078 --> 00:11:39,744
Definitely not
a porn virus.

291
00:11:39,746 --> 00:11:40,745
Shut up.

292
00:11:40,747 --> 00:11:42,046
How could you guys do this?

293
00:11:42,048 --> 00:11:43,881
I went out on a limb for you.

294
00:11:43,883 --> 00:11:44,882
I believed in you.

295
00:11:44,884 --> 00:11:45,866
Well, thank you.

296
00:11:45,868 --> 00:11:48,035
It was... it was a
wonderful opportunity.

297
00:11:48,037 --> 00:11:49,387
Oh, great opportunity.

298
00:11:52,007 --> 00:11:54,392
So, when do we get paid?

299
00:11:56,346 --> 00:11:57,428
Okay.

300
00:11:57,430 --> 00:11:59,681
Yeah, you can't.
I know their parents.

301
00:12:03,018 --> 00:12:05,019
Hey. What are you guys
doing here?

302
00:12:05,021 --> 00:12:07,739
I thought your shift
didn't end till 8:00 a.m.

303
00:12:07,741 --> 00:12:09,073
Well, we got done early.

304
00:12:09,075 --> 00:12:10,742
Oh. Everything go okay?

305
00:12:10,744 --> 00:12:12,026
I was kind of worried

306
00:12:12,028 --> 00:12:14,212
you might burn the whole place
down or something.

307
00:12:14,214 --> 00:12:17,165
Well, it wasn't "or something."

308
00:12:22,187 --> 00:12:25,189
How am I supposed to find jobs
in the next 24 hours?

309
00:12:25,191 --> 00:12:26,624
Beats me.

310
00:12:26,626 --> 00:12:28,259
It's like our parents
are clueless

311
00:12:28,261 --> 00:12:30,278
about how bad
the economy is.

312
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:32,430
Yeah.

313
00:12:33,315 --> 00:12:34,716
You know what,

314
00:12:34,718 --> 00:12:36,718
instead of working
for someone else,

315
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,553
we should start
our own business.

316
00:12:38,555 --> 00:12:40,221
I like that.

317
00:12:40,223 --> 00:12:42,890
We could find some
adventure capitalists

318
00:12:42,892 --> 00:12:45,443
and become, um...
what do you call...

319
00:12:45,445 --> 00:12:46,944
entrepraneers.

320
00:12:46,946 --> 00:12:49,230
Yeah. It's not like we
don't have our own good idea.

321
00:12:49,232 --> 00:12:50,948
We have great ideas.

322
00:12:53,652 --> 00:12:57,455
Hey, maybe we can put other
food on a stick and sell it.

323
00:12:57,457 --> 00:13:01,042
Yeah. Pizza on a stick.

324
00:13:01,044 --> 00:13:01,942
Pizza sticks.

325
00:13:01,944 --> 00:13:02,610
Pie.

326
00:13:02,612 --> 00:13:03,778
Pie sticks.

327
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:04,912
Fish.

328
00:13:04,914 --> 00:13:08,616
Yeah, what are we
going to call those?

329
00:13:08,618 --> 00:13:10,618
Fish-sicles!

330
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:11,969
Genius!

331
00:13:11,971 --> 00:13:13,137
Yeah.

332
00:13:13,139 --> 00:13:14,922
Excuse me.

333
00:13:15,114 --> 00:13:16,448
Did I hear you guys say

334
00:13:16,450 --> 00:13:17,782
you're looking for jobs?

335
00:13:17,784 --> 00:13:18,934
Yeah.

336
00:13:18,936 --> 00:13:20,335
Why?

337
00:13:36,535 --> 00:13:38,536
Maybe it's me.

338
00:13:38,538 --> 00:13:40,445
I'm an idiot magnet.

339
00:13:40,447 --> 00:13:41,997
Hey.

340
00:13:45,735 --> 00:13:48,220
Yup.

341
00:13:49,472 --> 00:13:50,360
Hi.

342
00:13:50,361 --> 00:13:51,527
How you doing?

343
00:13:51,529 --> 00:13:53,062
Not so good.

344
00:13:53,064 --> 00:13:55,397
Yeah, yeah, we heard,
and we're so, so sorry.

345
00:13:55,399 --> 00:13:56,749
So, so very sorry.

346
00:13:56,751 --> 00:13:58,984
Yeah, well, thank God
the files are backed up

347
00:13:58,986 --> 00:14:00,936
and insurance will cover
most of the damage.

348
00:14:00,938 --> 00:14:02,121
That's great news!

349
00:14:02,123 --> 00:14:03,272
Yes. Phew!

350
00:14:06,576 --> 00:14:11,831
You do realize that
your children are not normal.

351
00:14:11,833 --> 00:14:15,784
Well, yeah, but, you know,
what's normal?

352
00:14:15,786 --> 00:14:17,303
And-and in Jake's defense,

353
00:14:17,305 --> 00:14:18,971
he never would have done
anything like this

354
00:14:18,973 --> 00:14:21,090
unless, uh, you know.

355
00:14:23,261 --> 00:14:25,427
"You know" what, Alan?

356
00:14:25,429 --> 00:14:27,563
Well, I didn't want to,
you know, say anything

357
00:14:27,565 --> 00:14:30,015
but, uh, but clearly there's
a bad influence involved here.

358
00:14:30,017 --> 00:14:32,017
I mean, I don't want
to point any fingers,

359
00:14:32,019 --> 00:14:34,970
but, uh, his name rhymes
with "smeldridge."

360
00:14:36,390 --> 00:14:38,741
Oh, my God.

361
00:14:38,743 --> 00:14:40,492
You-you can't be serious.

362
00:14:40,494 --> 00:14:42,828
My son had never been in trouble
in his life

363
00:14:42,830 --> 00:14:44,446
until he met your son.

364
00:14:44,448 --> 00:14:45,748
Never been in trouble?

365
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:46,916
He tried
to counterfeit money

366
00:14:46,918 --> 00:14:48,751
with a computer
and an inkjet printer.

367
00:14:48,753 --> 00:14:50,953
The government dropped
the charges.

368
00:14:50,955 --> 00:14:52,955
Only because
there's no such thing

369
00:14:52,957 --> 00:14:54,823
as a $25 bill.

370
00:14:54,825 --> 00:14:56,792
Yeah? Yeah? Well,

371
00:14:56,794 --> 00:14:58,427
well, what about when Jake stole
your brother's Mercedes

372
00:14:58,429 --> 00:15:00,546
and lost it in Topanga Canyon?

373
00:15:00,548 --> 00:15:02,014
He didn't steal it.
He borrowed it.

374
00:15:02,016 --> 00:15:04,166
And he was only driving it
because my brother was drunk

375
00:15:04,168 --> 00:15:06,635
and someone had to take
his hooker home.

376
00:15:08,021 --> 00:15:11,140
In Topanga Canyon,
which is where she lived.

377
00:15:11,142 --> 00:15:13,025
You are always making excuses
for him.

378
00:15:13,027 --> 00:15:14,410
And you don't excuse Eldridge?

379
00:15:14,412 --> 00:15:16,395
Hey, he went through
a very rough divorce.

380
00:15:16,397 --> 00:15:17,613
And Jake didn't?

381
00:15:17,615 --> 00:15:20,199
Well, at least your
wife traded up.

382
00:15:20,201 --> 00:15:21,483
Wh-what is that supposed
to mean?

383
00:15:21,485 --> 00:15:24,036
Really?
That was too subtle for you?

384
00:15:25,956 --> 00:15:28,490
Hey, everybody, good news.

385
00:15:28,492 --> 00:15:30,326
You don't have to worry
about us finding work.

386
00:15:30,328 --> 00:15:31,627
You-you got a job?

387
00:15:31,629 --> 00:15:33,162
Yeah. It's not
just a job though.

388
00:15:33,164 --> 00:15:35,464
It's an adventure.

389
00:15:35,466 --> 00:15:37,383
What?

390
00:15:37,385 --> 00:15:40,535
We're gonna be
all we can be.

391
00:15:43,089 --> 00:15:45,240
Oh, oh, no-no, you didn't.

392
00:15:45,242 --> 00:15:46,475
We didn't what?

393
00:15:46,477 --> 00:15:47,893
Join the Army.

394
00:15:47,895 --> 00:15:50,879
Yeah, we joined the Army.
How'd you know?

395
00:15:52,515 --> 00:15:55,985
You need to listen to me.

396
00:15:57,570 --> 00:16:00,839
They are not normal.

397
00:16:08,114 --> 00:16:10,199
Uh, hiya.

398
00:16:10,201 --> 00:16:11,617
Hi.

399
00:16:11,619 --> 00:16:12,835
Looking for a new career?

400
00:16:12,837 --> 00:16:15,087
Um, I'm 44 years old.

401
00:16:15,089 --> 00:16:16,255
That's okay.

402
00:16:16,257 --> 00:16:18,073
Today's Army is all-inclusive.

403
00:16:18,075 --> 00:16:21,343
You can be as old and as gay
as you want.

404
00:16:21,345 --> 00:16:24,263
Uh, well,
that's-that's good to know.

405
00:16:24,265 --> 00:16:26,765
Um, uh, but I-I actually wanted
to talk to you

406
00:16:26,767 --> 00:16:29,018
about my son, Jake Harper.

407
00:16:29,886 --> 00:16:31,720
Harper. Harper.

408
00:16:31,722 --> 00:16:34,189
Oh, yeah,
wants to be a drone pilot.

409
00:16:34,191 --> 00:16:35,274
Yeah, he told me.

410
00:16:35,276 --> 00:16:36,608
He thinks it's like
a video game.

411
00:16:36,610 --> 00:16:37,810
Oh, it is.

412
00:16:37,812 --> 00:16:39,261
It's exactly like a video game.

413
00:16:39,263 --> 00:16:41,780
Except we blow up real people.

414
00:16:41,782 --> 00:16:44,700
Yeah, actually, that's what
I wanted to talk to you about.

415
00:16:44,702 --> 00:16:45,734
Um,

416
00:16:45,736 --> 00:16:46,902
I love my son,

417
00:16:46,904 --> 00:16:48,153
uh, but more importantly,

418
00:16:48,155 --> 00:16:50,489
I love my country,

419
00:16:50,491 --> 00:16:53,492
uh, which is why
I don't think my son

420
00:16:53,494 --> 00:16:56,445
should have access
to flying bombs.

421
00:16:57,630 --> 00:16:59,948
Or really any kind of weapon.

422
00:16:59,950 --> 00:17:01,450
I mean, between you and me,

423
00:17:01,452 --> 00:17:03,836
I've seen him try to pick up
spilled food with a fork

424
00:17:03,838 --> 00:17:05,671
and stab himself in the leg.

425
00:17:05,673 --> 00:17:07,423
And not just once.

426
00:17:07,425 --> 00:17:10,759
I understand your concern,
but our training is unsurpassed.

427
00:17:10,761 --> 00:17:12,644
We take boys
and turn them into men.

428
00:17:12,646 --> 00:17:14,463
I know you think that...

429
00:17:15,815 --> 00:17:18,300
but you don't know him
like I do.

430
00:17:18,302 --> 00:17:19,902
He's 18, right?
Yeah.

431
00:17:19,904 --> 00:17:22,321
Not currently on probation
or under indictment?

432
00:17:22,323 --> 00:17:24,573
No.
Is this his signature?

433
00:17:24,575 --> 00:17:25,657
Yeah.

434
00:17:25,659 --> 00:17:26,825
Then if he passes the physical,

435
00:17:26,827 --> 00:17:29,778
he's signed, stamped,
and off to camp.

436
00:17:30,613 --> 00:17:33,282
I see.

437
00:17:33,284 --> 00:17:35,617
Oh, look, al-Qaeda!

438
00:17:36,486 --> 00:17:38,837
It's just a copy!

439
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:41,673
Hey, guys, you like video games?

440
00:17:46,596 --> 00:17:48,380
Congratulations, Jake.

441
00:17:48,382 --> 00:17:51,100
I know I'm only your stepdad,
but I'm real proud of you.

442
00:17:51,102 --> 00:17:52,885
Thanks, Herb.
Were you ever in the Army?

443
00:17:52,887 --> 00:17:55,521
Well, the KISS Army.

444
00:17:57,474 --> 00:17:59,308
But I don't think
that really counts.

445
00:17:59,310 --> 00:18:01,477
You think Mom's ever gonna
stop crying

446
00:18:01,479 --> 00:18:02,677
before I go?

447
00:18:03,964 --> 00:18:06,014
My guess is no.

448
00:18:06,016 --> 00:18:07,950
Don't worry, Mom.

449
00:18:07,952 --> 00:18:09,234
I'll be fine.

450
00:18:09,236 --> 00:18:10,369
I'm a grown man now.

451
00:18:10,371 --> 00:18:12,204
No, you're not.

452
00:18:12,206 --> 00:18:14,356
You're my bigheaded baby.

453
00:18:33,376 --> 00:18:34,977
So, Berta,
are you gonna miss me?

454
00:18:34,979 --> 00:18:36,762
Nah, why should I miss you?

455
00:18:36,764 --> 00:18:38,897
You're just an extra
toilet to clean.

456
00:18:38,899 --> 00:18:41,400
That is, when you
hit the toilet.

457
00:18:58,017 --> 00:19:00,536
Don't worry, Grandma.
I'll make you proud of me.

458
00:19:00,538 --> 00:19:03,755
I've always been proud
of you, darling.

459
00:19:03,757 --> 00:19:05,541
In my own way.

460
00:19:22,725 --> 00:19:24,726
Thanks for everything.

461
00:19:24,728 --> 00:19:27,813
Come here.

462
00:19:37,123 --> 00:19:38,740
Look at
the bright side, Dad.

463
00:19:38,742 --> 00:19:40,409
You won't have
to buy me clothes anymore.

464
00:19:40,411 --> 00:19:42,077
They're gonna give me
a dress uniform,

465
00:19:42,079 --> 00:19:44,946
a work uniform, and even one
for when I'm tired.

466
00:19:44,948 --> 00:19:46,548
What?

467
00:19:46,550 --> 00:19:49,084
Yeah, they call 'em "fatigues."

468
00:19:49,086 --> 00:19:51,786
I don't know why they just
wouldn't call 'em pajamas.

469
00:19:51,788 --> 00:19:54,389
Oh, my son, my son.

470
00:20:18,414 --> 00:20:20,999
You be a good boy,
and you do what you're told,

471
00:20:21,001 --> 00:20:22,834
and promise me
you'll be careful.

472
00:20:22,836 --> 00:20:24,286
Don't worry about me.

473
00:20:25,538 --> 00:20:28,790
Worry about
our nation's enemies.

474
00:20:32,512 --> 00:20:34,680
I am worried.

475
00:20:39,793 --> 00:20:41,076
♪ Men. ♪

476
00:20:41,078 --> 00:20:42,873
Come on, you lazy pukes!

477
00:20:42,876 --> 00:20:44,843
Move it! Move it! Move it!

478
00:20:44,845 --> 00:20:47,078
When do we start flying
the robot planes?

479
00:20:48,181 --> 00:20:49,764
I don't know.

480
00:20:49,766 --> 00:20:51,230
Maybe after lunch.

481
00:20:52,457 --> 00:20:54,991
No, we're going
on a five-mile run after lunch.

482
00:20:54,993 --> 00:20:56,676
No, I'm gonna skip that.

483
00:20:56,678 --> 00:20:58,160
I want to take a nap.
