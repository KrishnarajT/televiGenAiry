00:00:06,909 --> 00:00:07,976
Ready, sweetheart?

3
00:00:07,978 --> 00:00:09,444
Almost.

4
00:00:09,446 --> 00:00:11,312
Okay.

5
00:00:12,281 --> 00:00:14,983
Oh, boy, oh, boy,
oh, boy, oh, boy.

6
00:00:19,006 --> 00:00:21,840
Oh, dinner's sitting
a little heavy.

7
00:00:21,842 --> 00:00:24,009
Well, maybe I can help you
work it off.

8
00:00:24,011 --> 00:00:25,660
Yeah, about that—

9
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:28,811
honey, would you mind terribly
if we just go to sleep?

10
00:00:28,833 --> 00:00:30,666
I'm so full and bloated
from that dinner,

11
00:00:30,668 --> 00:00:33,085
it'd be like sticking
a pin in a balloon.

12
00:00:34,087 --> 00:00:36,005
Can we not call it a pin?

13
00:00:36,007 --> 00:00:37,623
I'm sorry.

14
00:00:37,625 --> 00:00:39,226
I just don't think
I'd enjoy sex tonight.

15
00:00:39,227 --> 00:00:40,910
Since when is that
a requirement?

16
00:00:42,075 --> 00:00:43,207
But seriously, it's fine.

17
00:00:43,209 --> 00:00:44,775
It's no problem.

18
00:00:44,777 --> 00:00:46,277
Thank you.

19
00:00:46,279 --> 00:00:48,796
Ugh.

20
00:00:48,798 --> 00:00:52,166
Well, actually, it is a
little bit of problem.

21
00:00:52,168 --> 00:00:53,451
What's that?

22
00:00:53,453 --> 00:00:56,621
Well, uh, based
on past history—

23
00:00:56,623 --> 00:01:00,258
um, expensive dinner,
drinks, valet parking—

24
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:02,010
um, I thought

25
00:01:02,012 --> 00:01:03,978
we would probably
be fooling around tonight.

26
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:06,264
Uh, and-and-and with that
in mind,

27
00:01:06,266 --> 00:01:09,651
uh, about 20 minutes ago,
I popped a little blue pill

28
00:01:09,653 --> 00:01:12,570
to ensure that, uh,

29
00:01:12,572 --> 00:01:14,472
when you were ready, so was I.

30
00:01:14,474 --> 00:01:17,609
Of course, uh, now I'm ready
and you're not,

31
00:01:17,611 --> 00:01:21,362
a situation they didn't really
cover in those commercials.

32
00:01:22,247 --> 00:01:23,615
Oh, Alan.

33
00:01:23,617 --> 00:01:24,866
No, that's okay. It's okay.

34
00:01:24,868 --> 00:01:27,669
It's just kind of a shame
to waste them.

35
00:01:27,671 --> 00:01:30,321
I mean, they-they are
kind of pricey,

36
00:01:30,323 --> 00:01:33,424
even if they're expired ones
from Mexico.

37
00:01:33,426 --> 00:01:36,794
If I give you $20,
will you let me go to sleep?

38
00:01:38,163 --> 00:01:39,497
Oh, don't be silly.

39
00:01:39,499 --> 00:01:42,333
I don't want your money.

40
00:01:42,335 --> 00:01:44,435
But there are...

41
00:01:44,437 --> 00:01:46,837
other ways you
could reimburse me

42
00:01:46,839 --> 00:01:49,941
that wouldn't require a lot
of effort on your part.

43
00:01:57,483 --> 00:02:00,034
Should've taken the 20 bucks.

44
00:02:02,905 --> 00:02:04,572
Oh, hey.

45
00:02:04,574 --> 00:02:07,024
Oh, hey, Alan.

46
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:13,331
Want some whiskey?

47
00:02:13,333 --> 00:02:14,966
I thought you
didn't like to drink.

48
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:16,367
I don't.

49
00:02:16,369 --> 00:02:18,553
I'm trying to learn.

50
00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:23,925
I'm getting better.

51
00:02:23,927 --> 00:02:25,209
Is this about
your ex-wife?

52
00:02:25,211 --> 00:02:26,310
No.
Walden.

53
00:02:26,312 --> 00:02:27,378
Maybe.
Walden.

54
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:28,680
Yes.

55
00:02:31,518 --> 00:02:32,717
All right, all right.

56
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:33,851
Listen to me.

57
00:02:33,853 --> 00:02:36,604
Alcohol is just a bandage
for your problems.

58
00:02:36,606 --> 00:02:37,739
And I know this

59
00:02:37,741 --> 00:02:40,224
because I used to live
with the Mummy.

60
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,577
Uh... come on.

61
00:02:42,579 --> 00:02:44,362
We, uh... we got to get
your mind off of her.

62
00:02:44,364 --> 00:02:46,164
Let's, uh...
let's watch some TV.

63
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,117
Bridget and I
used to watch TV.

64
00:02:49,119 --> 00:02:51,235
That's the spirit.

65
00:02:51,237 --> 00:02:54,205
Okay, let's see
what's on.

66
00:02:54,207 --> 00:02:56,240
Oh.

67
00:02:56,242 --> 00:02:58,409
Cinnamon's Buns.

68
00:02:58,411 --> 00:03:02,413

falls for a bawdy baker.

00:03:02,415 --> 00:03:04,215
Adult. 1992."

70
00:03:04,217 --> 00:03:06,768
Ooh, a selection
from the classic era

71
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:08,936
of soft-core cable porn.

72
00:03:08,938 --> 00:03:12,089
Or what I like to call
the winter bush years.

73
00:03:13,058 --> 00:03:15,760
I haven't watched much
porn since college.

74
00:03:15,762 --> 00:03:17,278
Yeah, me, neither.

75
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,814
When I see it now, I just
feel bad for the girls.

76
00:03:19,816 --> 00:03:22,567
Yeah, yeah,
somebody's daughter. Shh.

77
00:03:22,569 --> 00:03:24,702
Are you ready to learn my craft?

78
00:03:24,704 --> 00:03:27,205
Of course, Master Baker.

79
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:29,273
I am entirely in your hands.

80
00:03:29,275 --> 00:03:32,210
This is not
historically accurate.

81
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:36,881
Medieval bakers did not
dress like Chef Boyardee.

82
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:40,084
Don't need the DVD
commentary here.

83
00:03:40,086 --> 00:03:41,302
Sorry.

84
00:03:41,304 --> 00:03:42,754
Now, Cinnamon,

85
00:03:42,756 --> 00:03:45,006
take my frosting bag.

86
00:03:45,008 --> 00:03:46,257
It's so big.

87
00:03:46,259 --> 00:03:48,459
I can barely get
my hand around it.

88
00:03:48,461 --> 00:03:50,728
Use both hands, m'lady.

89
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:53,264
It's well written.

90
00:03:53,266 --> 00:03:54,682
Like this?

91
00:03:54,684 --> 00:03:56,317
Now, squeeze,

92
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:59,487
and anoint thy muffins
with my frosting.

93
00:04:01,039 --> 00:04:03,608
Boy, she looks
familiar.

94
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:04,826
Yeah, she does.

95
00:04:04,828 --> 00:04:06,861
If I wasn't here,
would you be masturbating?

96
00:04:06,863 --> 00:04:10,531
You kidding? I'd be done
and fixing a sandwich.

97
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:14,252
Master Baker,
whatever are you doing?

98
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:17,622
I'm going to put my
loaf in your oven.

99
00:04:20,043 --> 00:04:22,043
That's clever.

100
00:04:22,045 --> 00:04:23,277
I don't know.

101
00:04:23,279 --> 00:04:25,713
She looks like a younger version
of your girlfriend.

102
00:04:25,715 --> 00:04:27,665
Lyndsey?
Uh-huh.

103
00:04:27,667 --> 00:04:29,550
Oh, nah.

104
00:04:29,552 --> 00:04:33,387
Oh, oh, you're so masterful!

105
00:04:33,389 --> 00:04:35,540
Kind of sounds like her, too.

106
00:04:36,441 --> 00:04:37,692
Maybe.

107
00:04:37,694 --> 00:04:39,443
Although I can't say
I've ever heard Lyndsey

108
00:04:39,445 --> 00:04:41,229
use that particular phrase.

109
00:04:41,231 --> 00:04:43,781
Don't stop! I can't get enough!

110
00:04:43,783 --> 00:04:45,683
Or that one.

111
00:04:45,685 --> 00:04:49,821
Maybe if I heard her say,
"Damn it, get off my hair."

112
00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:53,457
I don't know, Alan.

113
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:55,409
I think that's
your girlfriend.

114
00:04:55,411 --> 00:04:57,161
No, no.

115
00:04:57,163 --> 00:04:59,580
Yes! Yes!

116
00:04:59,582 --> 00:05:01,015
No. No.

117
00:05:01,017 --> 00:05:03,251
Yes! Yes!

118
00:05:03,253 --> 00:05:05,736
Oh, God! Oh, God!

119
00:05:05,738 --> 00:05:08,005
Oh, God!

120
00:05:08,007 --> 00:05:11,442
Boy, she's not
very convincing.

121
00:05:11,444 --> 00:05:13,544
It is Lyndsey.

122
00:05:13,546 --> 00:05:15,346
Okay, I'm going to go
upstairs and masturbate.

123
00:05:15,348 --> 00:05:16,731
Wait, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa!

124
00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:18,232
You're... you're
going to go

125
00:05:18,234 --> 00:05:20,484
pleasure yourself while you're
thinking about my girlfriend?

126
00:05:20,486 --> 00:05:21,819
No, that'd be creepy.

127
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:22,987
I'm going to go pleasure myself

128
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:24,572
while I'm thinking
about my wife.

129
00:05:24,574 --> 00:05:26,891
Wait. Your... your wife?
Seriously?

130
00:05:26,893 --> 00:05:28,442
Yeah, what can I say?
I love Bridget,

131
00:05:28,444 --> 00:05:30,728
and I think she's the sexiest
woman in the whole world.

132
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:32,914
Uh, you never fantasize
about anybody else?

133
00:05:32,916 --> 00:05:35,283
Mmm, sometimes I imagine
she's twins.

134
00:05:35,285 --> 00:05:37,234
Boo-ya!

135
00:05:41,239 --> 00:05:42,757
I never even thought of my wife

136
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:45,242
when I was actually
having sex with my wife.

137
00:05:45,244 --> 00:05:48,746
Oh, Master Baker!

138
00:05:49,581 --> 00:05:53,284
Boy, she never let me
do that to her.

00:05:56,722 --> 00:05:59,106

Look, I'm sorry
about last night.

It's okay.
I did offer this morning.

Can't expect me to turn on
like a light switch

In the entire time
I've known you,

you've never once passed up
an opportunity for sex.

160
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:57,615
So as not to hurt your feelings,
sometimes my mouth says, "Yes,"

161
00:06:57,617 --> 00:07:01,519
when my soul is screaming, "No"

162
00:07:01,521 --> 00:07:03,338
Oh, please!

163
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:05,556

165
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:08,843
Hey, hey, that was an accident.

166
00:07:08,845 --> 00:07:11,062
I was trying to walk and text.

167
00:07:11,064 --> 00:07:15,066
You were texting,
"Here comes Mr. Pokey."

168
00:07:15,068 --> 00:07:16,067

172
00:07:20,439 --> 00:07:21,739
I was speaking to Lyndsey.

173
00:07:21,741 --> 00:07:24,609
Sounds like a short
conversation.

174
00:07:25,944 --> 00:07:28,413
I should have my own talk show.

00:07:28,415 --> 00:07:29,797
Okay.

00:07:34,804 --> 00:07:36,621
You're an attractive woman.

181
00:07:36,623 --> 00:07:38,706
You don't have to settle.

182
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:41,709
I mean, bye!

183
00:07:42,594 --> 00:07:44,545
So, trouble in paradise?

184
00:07:44,547 --> 00:07:46,214
Why on Earth do you think

185
00:07:46,216 --> 00:07:47,882
I would share my problems
with you?

186
00:07:47,884 --> 00:07:49,133
Oh, come on.

187
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:51,436
I may tease you now and then,
but that doesn't mean

188
00:07:51,438 --> 00:07:53,721
that I don't care about you
as a human being.

189
00:07:56,508 --> 00:07:58,693
All right.

190
00:07:58,695 --> 00:08:00,311
What do you do when you're in

191
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:02,363
a relationship with someone
and, you know,

192
00:08:02,365 --> 00:08:03,448
like all
relationships, it...

193
00:08:03,450 --> 00:08:05,316
it has its ups
and downs, but...

194
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:08,018
generally, things are
going pretty good

195
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:09,454
until one day you discover

196
00:08:09,456 --> 00:08:12,857
that they are not at all
who you thought they were?

197
00:08:12,859 --> 00:08:15,376
And you don't know whether
to confront them about it or...

198
00:08:15,378 --> 00:08:16,878
or pretend you don't know,

199
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:19,363
because the idea of being alone
is worse

200
00:08:19,365 --> 00:08:22,433
than being with someone
who's deceived you.

201
00:08:25,471 --> 00:08:27,054
Berta?

202
00:08:27,056 --> 00:08:28,806
Hello?

203
00:08:28,808 --> 00:08:30,858

206
00:08:36,566 --> 00:08:38,099
Hey, I was thinking

207
00:08:38,101 --> 00:08:40,017
about your girlfriend's
porno movie.

208
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:41,936
Me, too. What about it?

209
00:08:41,938 --> 00:08:43,271
I want to learn to bake.

210
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:46,441
What?

211
00:08:46,443 --> 00:08:48,142
I think it'd be fun.

212
00:08:48,144 --> 00:08:52,413
You know, cookies and cupcakes,
pie, bread.

213
00:08:52,415 --> 00:08:54,749
That's what you took
from watching two people

214

00:08:56,736 --> 00:08:58,369
Well, I already know
how to have sex.

216
00:08:58,371 --> 00:08:59,837
How do you make

217
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:01,456

I'm still upset about not
getting laid in high school.

230
00:09:29,117 --> 00:09:31,118
But that's not what
I want to talk about.

231
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:33,437
Um, last night,
after you went to sleep,

232
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:36,774
I turned on the TV
and stumbled on

233
00:09:36,776 --> 00:09:39,377
a little motion picture
you appeared in.

234
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:43,714
You saw Cinnamon's Buns.

235
00:09:43,716 --> 00:09:47,668
I saw Cinnamon's buns.
I saw Cinnamon's boobs.

236
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:49,453
I saw the little birthmark

237
00:09:49,455 --> 00:09:51,722
on the inside
of Cinnamon's thigh.

238
00:09:51,724 --> 00:09:53,123
Oh, God.

239
00:09:53,125 --> 00:09:54,592

I-I'm dating

240
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:55,960
a soccer mom
from Sherman Oaks,

241
00:09:55,962 --> 00:09:58,462
and the next minute
a porn star on Cinemax.

242
00:09:59,314 --> 00:10:00,515
I'm not a porn star.

243
00:10:00,517 --> 00:10:01,899
It was a little nudity.

244
00:10:01,901 --> 00:10:02,967
And simulated sex.

245
00:10:02,969 --> 00:10:04,151
Most of it.

246
00:10:06,271 --> 00:10:07,655
Mo-most of it?

247
00:10:07,657 --> 00:10:09,807
It was 20 years
ago, Alan.

248
00:10:09,809 --> 00:10:11,859
I-I was young, stupid
and needed the money.

249
00:10:11,861 --> 00:10:13,027
Well, why didn't you
tell me about it?

250
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:14,445
Oh, yeah, right.
Who wouldn't be

251
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:16,146

this conversation?

252
00:10:16,148 --> 00:10:18,699
Well, I... I just feel
like such an idiot.

253
00:10:18,701 --> 00:10:20,117
You feel like an idiot?

254
00:10:20,119 --> 00:10:23,538
That casting director said he
could get me on Melrose Place.

I'm sorry.

256
00:10:29,161 --> 00:10:30,761
I should have told you.

00:10:30,763 --> 00:10:33,180
Any other secrets
you'd like to share with me?

258
00:10:33,182 --> 00:10:34,799
Wait a second.

259
00:10:34,801 --> 00:10:36,267
That's a two-way street.

260
00:10:36,269 --> 00:10:38,386
Do you have any secrets
you want to tell me?

What have you done
that you're ashamed of

264
00:10:43,026 --> 00:10:44,842
and don't want anyone
to know about?

265
00:10:48,313 --> 00:10:50,180
All right.

00:10:50,182 --> 00:10:53,951
Um... when I was a little boy,

267
00:10:53,953 --> 00:10:57,488
um, we had a dog
named Rusty,

268
00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:00,625
um, who loved
peanut butter,

269
00:11:00,627 --> 00:11:02,743
and, uh,

270
00:11:02,745 --> 00:11:05,496
my brother, uh,
convinced me

271
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:08,198
that the best way
to feed him, uh,

272
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:10,835
was to, uh, uh, smear it
on my testicles.

273
00:11:10,837 --> 00:11:13,004
Um...

274
00:11:13,006 --> 00:11:16,173

got very, very fat.

Let's recap the highlights.

285
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,518
You embezzled money
from your family,

286
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:46,236
you cheated on me
with an old girlfriend,

287
00:11:46,238 --> 00:11:47,905
- Mm-hmm.
- you might be the father

288
00:11:47,907 --> 00:11:49,740
of Judith and
Herb's baby,

289
00:11:49,742 --> 00:11:51,709
you didn't tell
your late brother that the woman

290
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:53,544
he was chasing
was married to a mannequin

291
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:55,880
because she gave you $50,000
to keep it a secret.

292
00:11:55,882 --> 00:11:58,415
And to top
it all off,

293
00:11:58,417 --> 00:12:01,519
you gave the family dog
type 2 diabetes.

294
00:12:02,354 --> 00:12:04,689
Oh, wait, one more thing.

295
00:12:04,691 --> 00:12:07,257
Those diamond earrings I got you
for your birthday last year...

296

Let me guess.
They're not real.

297
00:12:09,145 --> 00:12:10,427
Oh, no, they're real.

298
00:12:10,429 --> 00:12:13,447
Uh, it's just, I kind of
stole them from my ex-wife.

299
00:12:15,617 --> 00:12:19,987

to get all this off my chest.

And for what it's worth,

358
00:15:26,804 --> 00:15:30,672
um, I got a really big kick out
of seeing your original breasts.

359
00:15:33,009 --> 00:15:35,177
Okay. Bye-bye.

360
00:15:39,515 --> 00:15:42,785
Oh, she's gonna take
that last part wrong.

361
00:15:42,787 --> 00:15:44,687
Hey, Alan, come
here quick!

362
00:15:44,689 --> 00:15:45,871
Hurry!

363
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:51,210
Oh, what fresh hell is this?

364
00:15:54,530 --> 00:15:56,882
Surprise!

365
00:15:56,884 --> 00:15:59,084
What's... what's going on?

366
00:15:59,086 --> 00:16:01,053
It's a party to cheer you up.

367
00:16:02,672 --> 00:16:04,556
Hey, Alan, say hello to

368
00:16:04,558 --> 00:16:06,759
the Malibu College
beach volleyball team.

369
00:16:06,761 --> 00:16:08,010
Hi!

370
00:16:08,012 --> 00:16:11,480
Hello.

371
00:16:11,482 --> 00:16:14,016
Here, Alan, have a brownie.

372
00:16:14,018 --> 00:16:16,551
They're mmm-mmm good.

373
00:16:16,553 --> 00:16:18,937
Gee, Walden,
I really appreciate this,

374
00:16:18,939 --> 00:16:21,273
but it's a little soon
for me to be partying.

375
00:16:21,275 --> 00:16:23,225
I'm still hurting over Lyndsey.

376
00:16:23,227 --> 00:16:26,895
But what am I gonna do with
all these incredibly hot girls

377
00:16:26,897 --> 00:16:28,614
in bikinis
that are in the process

378
00:16:28,616 --> 00:16:30,916
of getting stoned
out of their minds?

379
00:16:30,918 --> 00:16:34,236
You're right,
I'm being thoughtless.

380
00:16:34,238 --> 00:16:36,288
Alan's here!

381
00:16:36,290 --> 00:16:38,173
♪ Men. ♪

382
00:16:47,217 --> 00:16:49,251
Do I look delicious?

383
00:16:49,253 --> 00:16:50,853
'Cause I feel delicious.

384
00:16:53,524 --> 00:16:55,357
Hey, Zip, I'm home.

385
00:16:55,359 --> 00:16:56,475
Where you been?

386
00:16:56,477 --> 00:16:59,395
Not a clue.

387
00:17:06,736 --> 00:17:10,656
Whoa, I just saw a giant cat
holding a churro.

388
00:17:13,494 --> 00:17:17,246
If that's a giant mouse,
he's in big trouble.

389
00:17:22,001 --> 00:17:24,670
Hey, it's Cinnamon!

390
00:17:24,672 --> 00:17:27,005
Oh, God, you saw it, too?

391
00:17:27,007 --> 00:17:28,924
Yeah, just a little.

392
00:17:28,926 --> 00:17:31,260
Then I went upstairs
to masturbate.

393
00:17:31,262 --> 00:17:33,462
Terrific.

394
00:17:33,464 --> 00:17:34,980
Is Alan here?

395
00:17:35,815 --> 00:17:38,233
Um...

396
00:17:38,235 --> 00:17:39,935
I don't think so.

397
00:17:40,904 --> 00:17:42,988
Let me check.

398
00:17:52,749 --> 00:17:55,117
You said Alan, right?

399
00:17:55,119 --> 00:17:56,618
Right.

400
00:17:56,620 --> 00:17:58,287
Hold on.

401
00:18:00,089 --> 00:18:02,090
All right, all right.

402
00:18:02,092 --> 00:18:04,543
Ladies, have you
got your spoons?

403
00:18:05,462 --> 00:18:06,962
Well, get rid of them.

404
00:18:06,964 --> 00:18:08,347
We are eating freestyle!

405
00:18:10,601 --> 00:18:11,884
Uh, excuse me.

406
00:18:11,886 --> 00:18:12,951
Wait. Hey. Whoa!

407
00:18:12,953 --> 00:18:14,553
Hey, what are
you doing?

408
00:18:14,555 --> 00:18:16,388
You'll thank me later.

409
00:18:16,390 --> 00:18:17,556
I can fly!

410
00:18:17,558 --> 00:18:19,107
Oh!

411
00:18:19,109 --> 00:18:20,893
No, I can't.

412
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:32,738
You said Alan, right?

413
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:34,490
Right.

414
00:18:34,492 --> 00:18:35,624
He's not here.

415
00:18:35,626 --> 00:18:38,293
Are you having some sort
of a party in there?

416
00:18:38,295 --> 00:18:41,630
Oh, no, it's just a bunch
of stoned girls dancing.

417
00:18:43,049 --> 00:18:44,500
G'bye-bye!

418
00:18:45,301 --> 00:18:47,469
Works better with an oven mitt.

419
00:18:54,010 --> 00:18:55,978
Walden!

420
00:18:56,813 --> 00:18:58,764
Oh, hey, Alan.

421
00:18:58,766 --> 00:19:00,349
You look ucky.

422
00:19:00,351 --> 00:19:02,935
Was that Lyndsey?

423
00:19:02,937 --> 00:19:05,070
Yeah. I told her
you were not here.

424
00:19:05,072 --> 00:19:08,440
I was not here because
you threw me off the deck.

425
00:19:08,442 --> 00:19:12,110
No, I threw you off the deck
so you would not be here.

426
00:19:12,112 --> 00:19:16,331
Wouldn't it have been easier
to just skip the throwing

427
00:19:16,333 --> 00:19:18,617
and tell her I'm not here?

428
00:19:20,454 --> 00:19:22,955
Next time.

429
00:19:24,374 --> 00:19:25,541
Oh! Hey.

430
00:19:25,543 --> 00:19:27,676
Great news,
we got a cat.

00:19:34,921 --> 00:19:36,854
So I thought about
it, and I decided

434
00:19:36,856 --> 00:19:39,424
that I really can't fault
you for opening up to me.

435
00:19:39,426 --> 00:19:42,644
I mean, every good relationship
has got to be based on honesty.

436
00:19:43,109 --> 00:19:45,075
Well, I'm glad
you feel that way.

437
00:19:45,077 --> 00:19:48,662
By the way, where were you
when I came over to the house?

438
00:19:48,664 --> 00:19:52,616
Well... honesty, right?

439
00:19:52,618 --> 00:19:54,118
Right.

440
00:19:59,576 --> 00:20:01,461
