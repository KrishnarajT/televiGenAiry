(engines roaring)

2
00:00:05,305 --> 00:00:06,504
Zoey: sorry, nigel.

3
00:00:06,505 --> 00:00:08,290
Dinner took longer
than i thought.

4
00:00:11,861 --> 00:00:15,463
And now we are stuck in traffic.

5
00:00:15,465 --> 00:00:17,432
Yeah, bumper to bumper.

6
00:00:17,434 --> 00:00:20,435
Well, tell ava i'll be there
in an hour, okay?

7
00:00:20,437 --> 00:00:21,853
Okay.

8
00:00:23,272 --> 00:00:25,106
Why didn't you
just tell him the truth?

9
00:00:25,108 --> 00:00:27,675
Because i know
my ex-Husband quite well,

10
00:00:27,677 --> 00:00:30,345
And it would really upset him
if he found out

11
00:00:30,347 --> 00:00:32,864
You flew me to san francisco
in your private jet

12
00:00:32,866 --> 00:00:35,317
Just to have fried clams.

13
00:00:35,319 --> 00:00:36,368
Yeah, you're right.

14
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:37,452
You shouldn't tell him.

15
00:00:37,454 --> 00:00:38,153
Thank you.

16
00:00:38,155 --> 00:00:38,987
I'll tell him.

17
00:00:38,989 --> 00:00:40,038
(laughs)

18
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:41,456
I just wanted to do
something nice for you

19
00:00:41,458 --> 00:00:42,523
Before you went to london.

20
00:00:42,525 --> 00:00:44,492
I'll only be gone a few weeks.

21
00:00:44,494 --> 00:00:46,694
And i...

22
00:00:46,696 --> 00:00:48,546
Will miss you.

23
00:00:48,548 --> 00:00:51,499
And i will miss you.

24
00:00:51,501 --> 00:00:52,467
(gasps)

25
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:53,635
Whoa.
What was that?

26
00:00:53,637 --> 00:00:54,803
(nervous chuckle)

27
00:00:54,805 --> 00:00:56,655
Don't worry, it's normal.

28
00:00:57,556 --> 00:00:59,591
(both screaming)

29
00:00:59,593 --> 00:01:01,142
Ahh! That's not normal!

30
00:01:01,144 --> 00:01:02,710
God, oh, god, oh, god!

31
00:01:02,712 --> 00:01:04,562
Zoey, i love you.

32
00:01:04,564 --> 00:01:05,981
I don't want to die.

33
00:01:05,983 --> 00:01:07,682
Did you hear me?
I said i love you.

34
00:01:07,684 --> 00:01:10,352
I heard you,
and i said i don't want to die.

35
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:23,782
Pilot:
sorry about that, mr. Schmidt.

36
00:01:23,784 --> 00:01:25,500
Just some clear air turbulence.

37
00:01:25,502 --> 00:01:27,735
Should be smooth sailing
from here on out.

38
00:01:27,737 --> 00:01:30,305

What's sadder than
an empty bottle of wine?

50
00:02:07,499 --> 00:02:11,701
Being the boyfriend of
a 40-Year-Old drunk soccer mom.

51

What?

52
00:02:13,038 --> 00:02:14,254
Oh, i was just thinking

53
00:02:14,256 --> 00:02:15,839
You might want
to slow down a little.

54
00:02:15,841 --> 00:02:18,324
It's only wine, geez.

55
00:02:18,326 --> 00:02:21,261
It's only been wine
since last july.

56
00:02:21,263 --> 00:02:23,213
Hey, hey, that got
a three-Star rating

57
00:02:23,215 --> 00:02:24,831
In the wal-Mart wine tracker.

58
00:02:24,833 --> 00:02:26,750
What's the big deal?

59
00:02:26,752 --> 00:02:28,885
So, i need a few glasses
to loosen me up.

60
00:02:28,887 --> 00:02:30,270
Are you saying you
need to get loaded

61
00:02:30,272 --> 00:02:31,354
In order to have sex with me?

62
00:02:31,356 --> 00:02:33,723
I'm not loaded.
Fine.

63
00:02:33,725 --> 00:02:35,792
But it doesn't hurt.

64
00:02:36,894 --> 00:02:38,561
Hey, guys.

65
00:02:38,563 --> 00:02:40,513
Wally! Want some wine?

66
00:02:40,515 --> 00:02:42,899
No, i don't like to drink
when i'm depressed.

67
00:02:42,901 --> 00:02:44,701
Wally, it's the best time
to drink.

68
00:02:44,703 --> 00:02:47,704
Also when you're bored, lonely,
or just, you know,

69
00:02:47,706 --> 00:02:49,005
Too sober.

70
00:02:49,857 --> 00:02:51,324
Why are you depressed?

71
00:02:51,326 --> 00:02:52,575
I don't know.

72
00:02:52,577 --> 00:02:53,910
It's kind of personal.

73
00:02:53,912 --> 00:02:56,129
Okay, no problem.

74
00:02:57,498 --> 00:02:58,715
What do you do when you

75
00:02:58,717 --> 00:03:00,633
Tell someone you love them
and they don't respond?

76
00:03:00,635 --> 00:03:03,386
(cork pops)
drink.

77
00:03:03,388 --> 00:03:05,338
Wait, you told zoey
you love her?

78
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:06,923
Yeah, i thought the plane
was gonna crash,

79
00:03:06,925 --> 00:03:08,258
And it just kind of came out,

80
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:11,111
Along with a little squirt
of pee.

81
00:03:11,929 --> 00:03:13,980
So, what did she say?

82
00:03:13,982 --> 00:03:18,384
(in british accent) "oh, god,
oh, god, i don't want to die."

83
00:03:18,386 --> 00:03:21,404
Well, given the circumstance,
that's a legitimate response.

84
00:03:21,406 --> 00:03:22,522
Sure, in the moment,

85
00:03:22,524 --> 00:03:24,074
But what about
after the plane leveled out?

86
00:03:24,076 --> 00:03:25,024
Well, what did she say then?

87
00:03:25,026 --> 00:03:27,861
"why do i smell pee?"

88
00:03:30,998 --> 00:03:32,866
Then we just sat there
in silence

89
00:03:32,868 --> 00:03:34,534
For the rest of the flight.

90
00:03:34,536 --> 00:03:36,553
Should have drank.

91
00:03:38,405 --> 00:03:41,207
Yeah, well, i'm gonna go
change my underwear

92
00:03:41,209 --> 00:03:42,625
Before i get diaper rash.

93
00:03:44,411 --> 00:03:46,763
Wow, i feel bad for him.

94
00:03:46,765 --> 00:03:48,181
Yeah.

95
00:03:48,183 --> 00:03:50,249
I mean, you know, to tell
somebody you love them,

96
00:03:50,251 --> 00:03:52,519
And just get no response.

97
00:03:52,521 --> 00:03:54,537
Awful.

98
00:03:57,591 --> 00:03:59,292
You know how i feel
about you, right?

99
00:03:59,294 --> 00:04:00,426
Right.

100
00:04:00,428 --> 00:04:02,145
You know how i
feel about you.

101
00:04:02,147 --> 00:04:05,148
Oh, absolutely.

102
00:04:08,402 --> 00:04:10,470
Still nice to hear
on occasion.

103
00:04:10,472 --> 00:04:12,622
Oh, i agree.

104
00:04:15,593 --> 00:04:19,712
I can do this
as long as you can, pal.

105
00:04:23,784 --> 00:04:24,834
(knocking)

106
00:04:24,836 --> 00:04:26,169
It's open.

107
00:04:26,171 --> 00:04:27,887
Hey.

108
00:04:27,889 --> 00:04:29,222
Can i talk to you for a minute?

109
00:04:29,224 --> 00:04:30,507
Sure. What's up?

110
00:04:30,509 --> 00:04:32,124
(sighs)

111
00:04:32,126 --> 00:04:34,310
I didn't sleep at all
last night, man.

112
00:04:34,312 --> 00:04:36,296
This zoey stuff
is making me crazy.

113
00:04:36,298 --> 00:04:37,797
Oh, man, i'm sorry.

114
00:04:37,799 --> 00:04:40,233
I'm starting to wonder

115
00:04:40,235 --> 00:04:42,819
If i should break
up with her,

116
00:04:42,821 --> 00:04:44,804
Oh, hang on. I mean,
just because she didn't say,

117
00:04:44,806 --> 00:04:46,739
"i love you," doesn't mean
she doesn't feel it.

118
00:04:46,741 --> 00:04:48,074
You think?

119
00:04:48,076 --> 00:04:49,976
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Some people have a hard time

120
00:04:49,978 --> 00:04:50,944
Articulating their feelings,

121
00:04:50,946 --> 00:04:53,196
So they express them
in other ways.

122
00:04:53,198 --> 00:04:55,398
(lyndsey vomiting loudly)

123
00:04:57,568 --> 00:04:58,484
Is that lyndsey?

124
00:04:58,486 --> 00:04:59,619
(lindsey groaning)

125
00:04:59,621 --> 00:05:02,205
Yeah, she had a little
too much vino last night.

126
00:05:02,207 --> 00:05:05,208
Anyway, i think you just have
to be patient with zoey.

127
00:05:05,210 --> 00:05:07,343
(lindsey vomiting loudly)

128
00:05:07,345 --> 00:05:09,662
Yeah, i guess.
(vomiting)

129
00:05:09,664 --> 00:05:11,347
(gagging)

130
00:05:13,851 --> 00:05:17,169
Sorry, i... I have a...
A hard time with...

131
00:05:17,171 --> 00:05:19,022
People throwing up.

132
00:05:19,024 --> 00:05:21,691
Try watching
and holding her hair.

133
00:05:21,693 --> 00:05:24,844
It's just, zoey's going
to england for a few weeks.

134
00:05:24,846 --> 00:05:26,362
(vomiting resumes)

135
00:05:28,282 --> 00:05:29,866
And-And i'm th... (gags)

136
00:05:31,068 --> 00:05:33,203
I'm-I'm starting to
think if... (gags)

137
00:05:33,205 --> 00:05:36,022
If i'm gonna end it,
now would be a good time.

138
00:05:36,024 --> 00:05:38,208
Well, it... (gags)
(vomiting)

139
00:05:40,828 --> 00:05:42,128
Whoa.

140
00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:44,047
You think i'd be
used to it by now.

141
00:05:44,049 --> 00:05:45,698
(groans)
no, no, no, don't...

142
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:46,966
Don't do anything hasty.

143
00:05:46,968 --> 00:05:49,168
(vomiting continues)

144
00:05:50,254 --> 00:05:53,256
I can't... I... I can't
just leave th...

145
00:05:53,258 --> 00:05:55,758
I can't just leave things
the way that they are.

146
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:58,478
Why don't you...
Why don't you go talk to her,

147
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:01,481
You know, and just put
your caaards on the table.

148
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:05,485
Yeah, maybe.
(gags)

149
00:06:05,487 --> 00:06:06,886
Lindsey: crap,

150
00:06:06,888 --> 00:06:08,922
Now i've got to change my bra.

151
00:06:08,924 --> 00:06:10,556
(lindsey grunts)

152
00:06:12,026 --> 00:06:14,661
I-I-I mean, maybe we should
just give her some privacy.

153
00:06:14,663 --> 00:06:19,215
Lindsey: oh, god,
now it's coming out both ends!

154
00:06:19,217 --> 00:06:21,501
(vomiting resumes)
good idea.

155
00:06:26,290 --> 00:06:28,207
Zoey: ava, you need
to get dressed.

156
00:06:28,209 --> 00:06:30,376
Mummy has to go.

157
00:06:32,596 --> 00:06:33,963
Walden.

158
00:06:33,965 --> 00:06:35,381
De-E-Lightful.

159
00:06:35,383 --> 00:06:39,352
Nigel, di-Isgusting.

160
00:06:41,355 --> 00:06:42,922
What, are you here
to pick up your daughter?

161
00:06:42,924 --> 00:06:44,274
I am.

162
00:06:44,276 --> 00:06:46,643
Zoey tell you that we took
my jet to san francisco

163
00:06:46,645 --> 00:06:48,478
Last night for fried clams?

164
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:51,114
No, she did not.

165
00:06:51,116 --> 00:06:53,366
Well, we did.

166
00:06:53,368 --> 00:06:56,035
Are you sharing this information
just to upset me?

167
00:06:56,037 --> 00:06:59,939
Actually, i was hoping to make
you feel inadequate as well.

168
00:06:59,941 --> 00:07:01,040
Oh, walden.

169
00:07:01,042 --> 00:07:02,475
What are you
doing here?

170
00:07:02,477 --> 00:07:03,876
Nigel, i'm running late,

171
00:07:03,878 --> 00:07:05,578
So will you for once please
make yourself useful

172
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:06,796
And help ava get ready?

173
00:07:06,798 --> 00:07:09,799
Well, only because
you asked so nicely.

174
00:07:09,801 --> 00:07:11,134
Enjoy her.

175
00:07:11,136 --> 00:07:12,418
Hi.

176
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:13,469
We need to talk.

177
00:07:13,471 --> 00:07:15,555
Now? I'm about to leave
for the airport.

178
00:07:15,557 --> 00:07:16,589
I'll take you.

179
00:07:16,591 --> 00:07:18,391
Thanks, but i have a car coming.

180
00:07:18,393 --> 00:07:19,642
Now, where is my passport?

181
00:07:19,644 --> 00:07:21,227
Nigel, have you
seen my passport?

182
00:07:21,229 --> 00:07:22,512
I don't live
here, zoey,

183
00:07:22,514 --> 00:07:24,480
I merely
pay the rent.

184
00:07:24,482 --> 00:07:26,566
Look, i just don't want
to leave things between us

185
00:07:26,568 --> 00:07:27,650
The way that they are.

186
00:07:27,652 --> 00:07:28,601
Everything's fine.

187
00:07:28,603 --> 00:07:29,819
No, it's not.

188
00:07:29,821 --> 00:07:31,303
I said i love you,
and the only thing

189
00:07:31,305 --> 00:07:34,190
I got in response is the not
very surprising information

190
00:07:34,192 --> 00:07:36,308
That you don't want to die
in a crashing plane.

191
00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:38,244
Can't we discuss this
when i get back?

192
00:07:38,246 --> 00:07:39,195
What's there to discuss?

193
00:07:39,197 --> 00:07:42,148
You either love me,
or you don't.

194
00:07:42,150 --> 00:07:45,001
Walden, i'm about to leave
on an important business trip,

195
00:07:45,003 --> 00:07:47,403
And the last thing i need
right now is more pressure.

196
00:07:47,405 --> 00:07:48,621
I'm not pressuring you.

197
00:07:48,623 --> 00:07:50,656
I'm just asking you for a
simple, definitive answer

198
00:07:50,658 --> 00:07:52,041
Right now before you leave.

199
00:07:52,043 --> 00:07:53,793
(glass breaking)
what was that?

200
00:07:53,795 --> 00:07:56,328
Sorry, just knocked over
your chinese table lamp.

201
00:07:56,330 --> 00:07:57,730
Perhaps you can
buy another one

202
00:07:57,732 --> 00:08:00,049
Next time you jet
to francisco.

203
00:08:01,602 --> 00:08:03,002
It came up.

204
00:08:03,004 --> 00:08:06,556
I'm sorry, i just don't have
the time for this now, okay?

205
00:08:06,558 --> 00:08:08,524
Ava, are you dressed?

206
00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:13,279
That seems pretty
definitive to me.

207
00:08:16,016 --> 00:08:17,183
That's it.

208
00:08:17,185 --> 00:08:19,235
No more relationships.
I'm done.

209
00:08:19,237 --> 00:08:20,570
Finished; just over.

210
00:08:20,572 --> 00:08:21,738
(elevator bell dings)

211
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:23,856
(exhales)

212
00:08:26,243 --> 00:08:27,577
Hi.

213
00:08:27,579 --> 00:08:29,462
Hi.

214
00:08:32,299 --> 00:08:33,833
And i'm back.

215
00:08:33,835 --> 00:08:35,835
♪ Men

216
00:08:42,090 --> 00:08:45,335
Hey, can i have 75 bucks
for the new call of duty?

217
00:08:45,337 --> 00:08:47,430
$75 for a video game?

218
00:08:47,432 --> 00:08:49,549
Think of it as an investment.

219
00:08:52,152 --> 00:08:53,903
An investment?

220
00:08:53,905 --> 00:08:56,155
Yeah. If i go into the
army after high school,

221
00:08:56,157 --> 00:08:59,108
I'll already know how
to kill terrorists.

222
00:09:00,277 --> 00:09:03,062
Who had corn chowder
for dinner last night?

223
00:09:03,064 --> 00:09:05,331
How do you know anybody
had corn chowder last night?

224
00:09:05,333 --> 00:09:07,420
'cause it's dripping
all over your bathroom.

225
00:09:07,445 --> 00:09:08,645
Oh.

226
00:09:08,903 --> 00:09:09,952
Sorry about that.

227
00:09:09,954 --> 00:09:12,405
Uh, lyndsey got a little bit...

228
00:09:12,407 --> 00:09:14,007
Queasy this morning.

229
00:09:14,009 --> 00:09:15,091
Is she pregnant?

230
00:09:15,093 --> 00:09:17,293
Oh, no, no, gosh, no.

231
00:09:17,295 --> 00:09:18,711
(uneasy chuckle)

232
00:09:18,713 --> 00:09:20,413
Absolutely not.

233
00:09:21,799 --> 00:09:23,633
Here.

234
00:09:23,635 --> 00:09:24,717
Me?

235
00:09:24,719 --> 00:09:26,469
Not my girlfriend,
not my vomit,

236
00:09:26,471 --> 00:09:27,937
Not my problem.

237
00:09:29,273 --> 00:09:30,273
I'll clean it up.

238
00:09:30,275 --> 00:09:31,090
You will?

239
00:09:31,092 --> 00:09:32,525
For 75 bucks.

240
00:09:32,527 --> 00:09:34,310
Woman:
that's great.

241
00:09:34,312 --> 00:09:36,646
Hey, everybody.

242
00:09:38,598 --> 00:09:40,650
This is jennifer.
Hi.

243
00:09:41,435 --> 00:09:43,453
Berta: hey.
Hey.

244
00:09:44,488 --> 00:09:46,205
Well, let's go take
a walk on the beach.

245
00:09:46,207 --> 00:09:47,323
Great.

246
00:09:47,325 --> 00:09:48,441
Uh, walden,
before you go,

247
00:09:48,443 --> 00:09:50,993
Can i talk to you
for a minute?

248
00:09:55,666 --> 00:09:56,949
I'll bring him right back.

249
00:09:56,951 --> 00:09:58,384
You'd better.

250
00:10:01,588 --> 00:10:02,788
My name's jake.

251
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:04,307
Hi, jake.

252
00:10:04,309 --> 00:10:07,810
My friends call me... Jake.

253
00:10:10,147 --> 00:10:11,514
What are you doing?

254
00:10:11,516 --> 00:10:12,815
Zoey made it perfectly clear.

255
00:10:12,817 --> 00:10:14,434
She doesn't love me or need me.

256
00:10:14,436 --> 00:10:15,818
So, i'm moving on.

257
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:18,137
You left here an hour ago.

258
00:10:18,139 --> 00:10:19,989
How did you find
another girl already?

259
00:10:19,991 --> 00:10:21,474
Oh, i met her in the elevator.

260
00:10:21,476 --> 00:10:22,825
I've been in
a million elevators.

261
00:10:22,827 --> 00:10:25,278
I never once walked out
with a girl like that.

262
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:27,196
Maybe you need to work
on your attitude.

263
00:10:27,198 --> 00:10:29,999
What exactly did zoey say?

264
00:10:30,001 --> 00:10:31,501
No, it's what she didn't say.

265
00:10:31,503 --> 00:10:33,202
She didn't say, "i love you."

266
00:10:33,204 --> 00:10:36,289
Oh, please! If i insisted on
women saying "i love you"

267
00:10:36,291 --> 00:10:39,475
I'd have never have had a
girlfriend, a wife or a mother.

268
00:10:39,477 --> 00:10:41,677
(ringtone playing)

269
00:10:42,930 --> 00:10:45,515
Oh. It's zoey.

270
00:10:47,801 --> 00:10:49,835
Hello?

271
00:10:49,837 --> 00:10:52,338
So, jennifer,
how old are you?

272
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:54,140
24. How old are you?

273
00:10:54,142 --> 00:10:56,225
I'm... 24-And-A-Half.

274
00:10:56,227 --> 00:10:58,344
Hmm.

275
00:11:03,534 --> 00:11:05,701
Hmm?

276
00:11:06,487 --> 00:11:08,321
I'm surprised
that you called.

277
00:11:08,323 --> 00:11:09,539
Where are you?

278
00:11:09,541 --> 00:11:10,873
On the plane.

279
00:11:10,875 --> 00:11:11,991
We're sitting at the gate.

280
00:11:11,993 --> 00:11:13,576
Are you okay?
Zoey: no.

281
00:11:13,578 --> 00:11:16,078
I feel miserable
about the way we left things.

282
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:18,080
You do?
Zoey: yeah.

283
00:11:18,082 --> 00:11:20,199
I've just been so stressed
and busy lately

284
00:11:20,201 --> 00:11:22,335
That i haven't been able
to think straight.

285
00:11:22,337 --> 00:11:25,371
But sitting here
for the last 40 minutes

286
00:11:25,373 --> 00:11:29,208
Without so much
as a bloody glass of water,

287
00:11:29,210 --> 00:11:31,544
I've come to a realization.

288
00:11:31,546 --> 00:11:32,979
I'm listening.

289
00:11:32,981 --> 00:11:35,064
The reason i haven't said...

290
00:11:35,066 --> 00:11:37,066
Those words to you

291
00:11:37,068 --> 00:11:39,018
Is because i'm afraid

292
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:42,321
That if i do say them,
something bad will happen.

293
00:11:42,323 --> 00:11:43,773
Why would you think that?

294
00:11:43,775 --> 00:11:45,658
'cause it always has.

295
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:47,577
I've only said
those words twice.

296
00:11:47,579 --> 00:11:49,728
The last time,
i ended up married

297
00:11:49,730 --> 00:11:52,915
To an insufferable twit.

298
00:11:52,917 --> 00:11:54,066
And the time before that?

299
00:11:54,068 --> 00:11:55,635
I got a thank-You note

300
00:11:55,637 --> 00:11:58,704
And a swatch watch
from russell brand.

301
00:11:58,706 --> 00:12:00,339
Russell brand?

302
00:12:00,341 --> 00:12:03,092
Mm, not my proudest moment.

303
00:12:03,094 --> 00:12:04,594
Okay. I get it.

304
00:12:04,596 --> 00:12:06,078
So, you're just superstitious
about saying it,

305
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:09,131
But it has nothing to do with
the way that you feel about me?

306
00:12:09,133 --> 00:12:11,717
No. Not at all.

307
00:12:11,719 --> 00:12:14,086
In fact, the whole reason
i called is

308
00:12:14,088 --> 00:12:15,688
To tell you that i honestly
i...

309
00:12:15,690 --> 00:12:17,190
Oh, there you are.

310
00:12:17,192 --> 00:12:20,893
Ooh! Cool bedroom.

311
00:12:20,895 --> 00:12:21,777
Who's that?

312
00:12:21,779 --> 00:12:24,947
Uh... Berta.

313
00:12:24,949 --> 00:12:27,783
You couldn't even wait
till my plane takes off?

314
00:12:27,785 --> 00:12:29,902
No, no, zoey, it's not what you think!
Oh, good-Bye, walden.

315
00:12:29,904 --> 00:12:32,238
Zoey, just...

316
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:36,125
♪ Awkward!

317
00:12:45,452 --> 00:12:49,388
Oh... I can't believe i kissed
the mouth that did this.

318
00:12:50,924 --> 00:12:53,626
Alan, i need to
talk to you. Oh!

319
00:12:54,978 --> 00:12:56,629
Can we do it out here?

320
00:12:56,631 --> 00:12:58,231
Gladly.

321
00:12:58,233 --> 00:12:59,649
Oh, good lord!

322
00:12:59,651 --> 00:13:02,652
Looks like someone
cleaned a deer in the bathtub.

323
00:13:04,988 --> 00:13:06,188
What's going on?

324
00:13:06,190 --> 00:13:07,640
Zoey facetimed me
from the plane

325
00:13:07,642 --> 00:13:09,158
To tell me that she loves me.

326
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:09,680
Good.

327
00:13:09,705 --> 00:13:11,235
But she saw jennifer
in my bedroom.

328
00:13:11,236 --> 00:13:11,916
Bad.

329
00:13:11,941 --> 00:13:13,776
So, naturally, i immediately
tried to call her back.

330
00:13:13,781 --> 00:13:15,281
Good.
But she wouldn't answer.

331
00:13:15,283 --> 00:13:16,699
Bad.
So i'm gonna fuel up my jet,

332
00:13:16,701 --> 00:13:18,167
And fly to london
and beg for forgiveness.

333
00:13:18,169 --> 00:13:20,670
Good.
Will you stop that, alan?

334
00:13:20,672 --> 00:13:22,838
I-I need you to come with me.
Me? Why?

335
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:24,624
Because i might need a witness,
and you can say

336
00:13:24,626 --> 00:13:26,092
That you saw that
nothing happened with jennifer.

337
00:13:26,094 --> 00:13:27,510
Great. I'm your man.

338
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:31,847
I am not gonna touch that glove.

339
00:13:32,832 --> 00:13:33,849
Come on.

340
00:13:33,851 --> 00:13:35,101
Oh, uh, wait.

341
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:36,719
I promised lyndsey
i'd take her out

342
00:13:36,721 --> 00:13:38,220
To a big, fancy,
romantic dinner tonight.

343
00:13:38,222 --> 00:13:39,355
Bring her.
Really?

344
00:13:39,357 --> 00:13:40,172
Yeah, sure.

345
00:13:40,174 --> 00:13:41,340
Well, i guess a private jet

346
00:13:41,342 --> 00:13:42,441
To london does beat

347
00:13:42,443 --> 00:13:44,393
An 11-Year-Old volvo
to the olive garden.

348
00:13:44,395 --> 00:13:45,811
I'll-I'll pack a bag.

349
00:13:45,813 --> 00:13:46,946
No, no, no, there's no time.

350
00:13:46,948 --> 00:13:48,314
I'll buy you whatever you need
in london.

351
00:13:48,316 --> 00:13:49,782
You're kidding.
Yeah. Come on.

352
00:13:49,784 --> 00:13:51,784
Hey, if zoey won't say it,
i will.

353
00:13:51,786 --> 00:13:54,019
I love you, walden schmidt.

354
00:13:55,789 --> 00:13:57,990
(engines roaring)

355
00:13:59,993 --> 00:14:01,994
(sighs contentedly)

356
00:14:01,996 --> 00:14:04,029
(clears throat)

357
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:05,631
Thank you, walden.

358
00:14:05,633 --> 00:14:07,550
This is just incredible.

359
00:14:07,552 --> 00:14:09,168
Glad you like it.
Mm.

360
00:14:09,170 --> 00:14:11,137
What did your son say
when you told him

361
00:14:11,139 --> 00:14:12,388
You were flying
to london tonight?

362
00:14:12,390 --> 00:14:15,324
He told me to bring him back
some english pot.

363
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:19,979
This is definitely
the way to travel.

364
00:14:19,981 --> 00:14:22,381
No boarding passes,
no airport security,

365
00:14:22,383 --> 00:14:23,683
None of those scanners

366
00:14:23,685 --> 00:14:25,735
That show strangers
the size of your dingle.

367
00:14:25,737 --> 00:14:29,238
Don't you worry about
your dingle, honey.

368
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:31,691
He's a grower, not a shower.

369
00:14:31,693 --> 00:14:32,891
Yeah, he told me.

370
00:14:32,893 --> 00:14:34,827
He tells everyone.

371
00:14:40,817 --> 00:14:43,152
Jake: can i interest
you in a brewski?

372
00:14:44,187 --> 00:14:45,187
What?

373
00:14:45,189 --> 00:14:46,255
That's polish for

374
00:14:46,257 --> 00:14:48,541
"do you want a beer?"

375
00:14:48,543 --> 00:14:50,843
I've traveled
extensively through asia.

376
00:14:52,346 --> 00:14:54,547
Oh. Thanks.

377
00:14:56,583 --> 00:14:58,934
Are you sure walden said
he'd be right back?

378
00:14:58,936 --> 00:15:00,436
Forget walden.

379
00:15:00,438 --> 00:15:02,087
Let's talk about us.

380
00:15:02,089 --> 00:15:03,356
Us?

381
00:15:03,358 --> 00:15:05,408
That's english
for you and me.

382
00:15:10,147 --> 00:15:12,398
Lyndsey:
♪ Poppin' bottles in the ice

383
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:13,783
♪ Like a blizzard

384
00:15:13,785 --> 00:15:15,952
♪ When we drunk, we do it right,
gettin' slizzard ♪

385
00:15:15,954 --> 00:15:17,871
♪ Like a g-6, like a g-6...

386
00:15:17,873 --> 00:15:19,622
Uh, honey, honey,
why don't you take your seat

387
00:15:19,624 --> 00:15:20,790
And put your seatbelt on?

388
00:15:20,792 --> 00:15:22,942
Pish, pish, party pooper.

389
00:15:22,944 --> 00:15:27,463
Wally, this is so romantic
what you're doing.

390
00:15:27,465 --> 00:15:30,833
You are flying
across a whole ocean

391
00:15:30,835 --> 00:15:33,503
Just to win back
the woman you love.

392
00:15:33,505 --> 00:15:35,755
Thank you.

393
00:15:35,757 --> 00:15:39,058
Alan, sweetie,
i need to tell you something.

394
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:40,293
Yeah?

395
00:15:40,295 --> 00:15:42,345
I know i give you a hard time,

396
00:15:42,347 --> 00:15:45,014
But in my heart,

397
00:15:45,016 --> 00:15:49,018
I really, really
love... (gags)

398
00:15:50,487 --> 00:15:51,688
(lyndsey vomits loudly)

399
00:15:51,690 --> 00:15:52,906
Alan:
oh, god!

400
00:15:52,908 --> 00:15:54,741
Oh. Aah.

401
00:15:54,743 --> 00:15:55,858
I'm so sorry.

402
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:56,943
Alan:
oh! Oh!

403
00:15:56,945 --> 00:15:58,644
Lyndsey:
oh. Oh.

404
00:15:58,646 --> 00:15:59,996
So sorry.
Here. Here.

405
00:15:59,998 --> 00:16:01,414
Oh, thank you.

406
00:16:01,416 --> 00:16:03,449
(lyndsey vomiting,
alan gagging)

407
00:16:03,451 --> 00:16:04,650
Oh, god!

408
00:16:04,652 --> 00:16:06,653
Oh!
Oh, my god!

409
00:16:06,655 --> 00:16:07,921
Oh, hang on.
Oh, god!

410
00:16:07,923 --> 00:16:09,505
I'll-I'll get...
I'll get some towels.

411
00:16:10,424 --> 00:16:11,657
(yelling)

412
00:16:11,659 --> 00:16:13,092
Pilot (over pa): okay, folks,

413
00:16:13,094 --> 00:16:15,011
We've got clear skies ahead,

414
00:16:15,013 --> 00:16:17,847
And we'll be in london
in approximately four hours.

415
00:16:17,849 --> 00:16:20,683
So, just sit back and enjoy
the rest of your flight.

416
00:16:20,685 --> 00:16:23,987
(vomit splashing,
walden crying)

417
00:16:23,989 --> 00:16:26,723
♪ Men.

418
00:16:26,725 --> 00:16:28,858
Bottom line, zoey,
i can assure you

419
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:31,527
That nothing happened
between walden and that woman.

420
00:16:31,529 --> 00:16:32,695
Really?

421
00:16:32,697 --> 00:16:34,948
What possible reason
would i have to lie to you?

422
00:16:34,950 --> 00:16:36,182
Well, for one thing, he gave

423
00:16:36,184 --> 00:16:38,017
You and lyndsey a
free trip to london,

424
00:16:38,019 --> 00:16:39,652
Where you all
inexplicably decided

425
00:16:39,654 --> 00:16:41,938
To dress up
like japanese tourists.

426
00:16:43,407 --> 00:16:44,490
That's my fault.

427
00:16:44,492 --> 00:16:46,542
I kind of threw up
on them a little.

428
00:16:46,544 --> 00:16:48,828
A little?
I might have to get a new plane.

429
00:16:48,830 --> 00:16:51,714
Yes, yes, yes, that's
all very interesting,

430
00:16:51,716 --> 00:16:52,865
But the fact remains

431
00:16:52,867 --> 00:16:54,667
That you still invited
my neighbor jennifer...

432
00:16:54,669 --> 00:16:56,135
The whore
from the seventh floor...

433
00:16:56,137 --> 00:16:57,253
Back to your house.

434
00:16:57,255 --> 00:16:59,005
Yeah, but nothing happened.

435
00:16:59,007 --> 00:17:01,808
Nothing happened 'cause
i called and interrupted you!

436
00:17:01,810 --> 00:17:05,395
Okay, i think we're saying
the same thing here.

437
00:17:05,397 --> 00:17:07,213
Listen, the fact is, i love you.

438
00:17:07,215 --> 00:17:09,816
Okay, and i was an idiot
to put pressure on you,

439
00:17:09,818 --> 00:17:14,621
I made a terrible mistake,
and i'm very, very sorry.

440
00:17:19,943 --> 00:17:23,396
Okay. Uh, we sh...

441
00:17:23,398 --> 00:17:25,531
I think we should go.

442
00:17:25,533 --> 00:17:27,450
(sighs)

443
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:31,070
I do love you, walden.

444
00:17:33,090 --> 00:17:35,108
You do?

445
00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:37,093
Of course i do.

446
00:17:37,095 --> 00:17:39,846
That's why i called you
from the plane, you ninny.

447
00:17:41,682 --> 00:17:43,716
So...

448
00:17:43,718 --> 00:17:45,685
You forgive me?

449
00:17:45,687 --> 00:17:47,353
Well, that depends.

450
00:17:47,355 --> 00:17:49,972
Do i have to worry every time
we have a fight

451
00:17:49,974 --> 00:17:52,608
That you're going to go out
and pick up another woman?

452
00:17:52,610 --> 00:17:55,695
Not as long
as i know that you love me.

453
00:17:55,697 --> 00:17:57,864
Good answer.

454
00:17:59,616 --> 00:18:01,767
Come here.

455
00:18:12,746 --> 00:18:14,781
I love you, lyndsey.

456
00:18:14,783 --> 00:18:17,967
And i love you.

457
00:18:18,802 --> 00:18:20,169
(gagging)

458
00:18:20,171 --> 00:18:22,138
Alan:
oh, not in my mouth!

459
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:23,840
(lyndsey and alan gagging)
oh, god.

460
00:18:23,842 --> 00:18:25,308
Oh, dear.

461
00:18:25,310 --> 00:18:27,510
(walden and zoey retching)

462
00:18:36,467 --> 00:18:38,968
No, seriously, dude. No lie.

463
00:18:38,970 --> 00:18:42,555
All right, fine,
you don't believe me? Here.

464
00:18:45,843 --> 00:18:50,713
Yup. Five times.
Best half hour of my life.
