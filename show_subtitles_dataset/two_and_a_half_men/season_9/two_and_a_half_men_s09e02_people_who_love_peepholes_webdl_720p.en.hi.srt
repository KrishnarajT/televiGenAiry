1
00:00:01,622 --> 00:00:03,546
Previously on Two and a Half Men...

2
00:00:03,997 --> 00:00:05,406
I think we can all agree

3
00:00:05,431 --> 00:00:07,762
that Charlie lived life to its fullest

4
00:00:07,787 --> 00:00:09,644
and-and gave it everything he had.

5
00:00:09,669 --> 00:00:10,869
Gave me herpes.

6
00:00:12,808 --> 00:00:14,350
I still don't see why we have to sell.

7
00:00:14,351 --> 00:00:15,279
I mean, he left it to me.

8
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:16,531
Obviously, he wanted me to have it.

9
00:00:16,533 --> 00:00:18,366
Can you make the mortgage payments?

10
00:00:18,368 --> 00:00:19,917
Not per se.

11
00:00:19,919 --> 00:00:20,935
Are you okay?

12
00:00:20,937 --> 00:00:22,320
Yeah, I'm fine.

13
00:00:22,322 --> 00:00:24,989
I was just trying to drown myself.

14
00:00:24,991 --> 00:00:26,207
You tried to commit suicide?

15
00:00:26,209 --> 00:00:27,408
Yeah.

16
00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:29,727
I had no idea that the water
would be that cold.

17
00:00:29,729 --> 00:00:32,330
I have been where you are.

18
00:00:32,332 --> 00:00:35,416
Uh, rejected, friendless, broke.

19
00:00:35,418 --> 00:00:36,417
I'm not broke.

20
00:00:36,419 --> 00:00:38,136
I'm worth, like, a billion dollars.

21
00:00:38,138 --> 00:00:40,621
Beg pardon?

22
00:00:40,623 --> 00:00:41,739
I just went to one funeral,

23
00:00:41,741 --> 00:00:43,341
I don't want to be
involved in another one.

24
00:00:43,343 --> 00:00:47,311
Why don't you and I go out
and have a drink and talk?

25
00:00:47,313 --> 00:00:48,262
About what?

26
00:00:48,264 --> 00:00:49,680
Why somebody would want

27
00:00:49,682 --> 00:00:52,283
to kill themselves when they
have a billion freakin' dollars.

28
00:00:52,285 --> 00:00:54,168
My...

29
00:00:55,437 --> 00:00:58,606
wife dumped me, and I want to die.

30
00:00:58,608 --> 00:01:00,775
I don't know

31
00:01:00,777 --> 00:01:05,530
if I can ever love anyone
the way that I love her.

32
00:01:05,532 --> 00:01:07,999
Oh, it'll be okay.

33
00:01:13,005 --> 00:01:16,274
Oh, God, I miss my wife!

34
00:01:16,276 --> 00:01:17,375
Guess what.

35
00:01:17,377 --> 00:01:19,760
I had sex with two girls last night.

36
00:01:19,762 --> 00:01:23,464
Great. Um, I masturbated
and cried myself to sleep.

37
00:01:23,466 --> 00:01:25,766
I like my night better.

38
00:01:25,768 --> 00:01:29,136
Hey, I dig your house,
so I'm gonna buy it, okay?

39
00:01:29,138 --> 00:01:30,671
O-Okay.

40
00:01:30,673 --> 00:01:31,689
You're the best.

41
00:01:31,691 --> 00:01:33,124
Oh. Ugh.

42
00:01:33,642 --> 00:01:35,443
Whoa.

43
00:01:38,530 --> 00:01:40,865
Um, this is Walden.

44
00:01:42,034 --> 00:01:45,069
He's gonna buy the house.

45
00:01:45,071 --> 00:01:48,539
Welcome to my humble abode.

46
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:53,861
♪ Men. ♪

47
00:01:53,863 --> 00:01:55,846
So, what do think?

48
00:01:55,848 --> 00:01:57,415
Will you stay on?

49
00:01:57,417 --> 00:01:59,533
I'd consider it,
if the price is right.

50
00:01:59,535 --> 00:02:01,469
I'd also consider smothering you

51
00:02:01,471 --> 00:02:03,537
with my sweet, sweet loving.

52
00:02:03,539 --> 00:02:05,623
Well, money is not an issue.

53
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:06,641
Good to know.

54
00:02:06,643 --> 00:02:09,477
Ka-ching.

55
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:10,645
What's down here?

56
00:02:10,647 --> 00:02:11,646
Ice.

57
00:02:11,648 --> 00:02:14,048
Mm. I like it better on top.

58
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:17,268
Me, too, puppy.

59
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:18,686
Anyway, what I really need is

60
00:02:18,688 --> 00:02:20,771
a housekeeper who's gonna
be here all the time.

61
00:02:20,773 --> 00:02:25,076
'Cause, you know, I'm not very
good at taking care of myself.

62
00:02:25,078 --> 00:02:27,061
Oh, I can take care of you.

63
00:02:27,063 --> 00:02:30,147
Oh, I can take care of you.

64
00:02:30,149 --> 00:02:31,899
Well, my car's all packed.

65
00:02:31,901 --> 00:02:33,367
I guess I'm ready to go.

66
00:02:33,369 --> 00:02:34,752
Great news, Alan.

67
00:02:34,754 --> 00:02:37,538
Berta has agreed to be
my live-in housekeeper.

68
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:38,372
Really?

69
00:02:38,374 --> 00:02:40,407
Yeah, he talked me into it.

70
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:44,078
I wonder what his sweat tastes like.

71
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,596
Well, that is good news.

72
00:02:45,598 --> 00:02:47,932
Uh, here are a couple of sets of keys,

73
00:02:47,934 --> 00:02:49,267
remotes for the garage,

74
00:02:49,269 --> 00:02:51,135
and remember,
garbage pickup is on Tuesday.

75
00:02:51,137 --> 00:02:52,887
Oh, you take care
of the garbage, right?

76
00:02:52,889 --> 00:02:54,171
Nope.

77
00:02:55,207 --> 00:02:58,626
Well, uh, guess it's time
for me to go.

78
00:02:59,478 --> 00:03:01,279
Wait. Come here.

79
00:03:01,281 --> 00:03:02,613
Give us a hug good-bye.

80
00:03:02,615 --> 00:03:03,898
Seriously?

81
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:05,149
Come on, Alan.

82
00:03:05,151 --> 00:03:07,535
Despite everything, you and me
have been like family.

83
00:03:07,537 --> 00:03:09,570
Uh, I guess.

84
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:13,691
I'm taking your room, Zippy.

85
00:03:15,394 --> 00:03:16,694
Of course you are.

86
00:03:16,696 --> 00:03:19,080
Well, see ya.

87
00:03:19,082 --> 00:03:22,233
I'll walk you out.

88
00:03:23,969 --> 00:03:27,287
I could bite that ass like an apple.

89
00:03:27,289 --> 00:03:29,840
Well, I hope you'll be
very happy here, Walden.

90
00:03:29,842 --> 00:03:31,842
Thank you. I don't know if I can be

91
00:03:31,844 --> 00:03:33,377
happy anywhere without my wife.

92
00:03:33,379 --> 00:03:35,313
Oh, come on,
you're young, you're rich,

93
00:03:35,315 --> 00:03:38,599
and you've got a face
that gives women an erection.

94
00:03:40,986 --> 00:03:42,302
What about love?

95
00:03:42,304 --> 00:03:43,704
What about commitment?

96
00:03:43,706 --> 00:03:47,158
What about spending a lifetime
with your spiritual soul mate?

97
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,642
Hey, look, a peephole!

98
00:03:50,662 --> 00:03:53,147
Hello!

99
00:03:53,149 --> 00:03:56,083
Man, I love peepholes.

100
00:03:56,085 --> 00:03:58,703
Well, you know what they say.

101
00:03:58,705 --> 00:04:00,838
People who love peepholes...

102
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:05,092
are the luckiest people in the world.

103
00:04:07,212 --> 00:04:08,679
Okay, good luck.

104
00:04:08,681 --> 00:04:14,101
Hey, thank you
for all your help and advice.

105
00:04:14,103 --> 00:04:15,353
Oh, you're welcome.

106
00:04:15,355 --> 00:04:17,605
Uh, and if you ever need
a friend to talk to man-to-man,

107
00:04:17,607 --> 00:04:18,723
you know where to find me.

108
00:04:18,725 --> 00:04:20,274
Your mommy's.

109
00:04:20,276 --> 00:04:22,259
Only temporarily.

110
00:04:25,097 --> 00:04:26,063
Okay.

111
00:04:26,065 --> 00:04:29,483
Well, uh, if I left anything here,

112
00:04:29,485 --> 00:04:32,486
feel free to, you know, keep it,
throw it away, whatever.

113
00:04:32,488 --> 00:04:34,372
Great. Bye.

114
00:04:34,374 --> 00:04:36,690
Bye.

115
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:42,713
Bye!

116
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:49,720
Okay, Walden Schmidt.

117
00:04:49,722 --> 00:04:53,641
It is time to start your new
life as a single man in Malibu.

118
00:04:59,865 --> 00:05:01,532
Hello?

119
00:05:02,234 --> 00:05:03,668

Why are you unpacking?

124
00:05:21,259 --> 00:05:22,892
Because you told me I could stay here.

125
00:05:22,893 --> 00:05:24,292
Temporarily.

126
00:05:24,294 --> 00:05:26,611
Yeah, a few days, a couple of weeks,

127
00:05:26,613 --> 00:05:28,380
a month, tops.

128
00:05:28,382 --> 00:05:29,948
Yeah, right.

129
00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:32,584
Why can't you just stay
with your girlfriend?

130
00:05:32,586 --> 00:05:34,970
Oh, oh, this isn't a very good
time for Lyndsey and I

131
00:05:34,972 --> 00:05:36,087
to be moving in together.

132
00:05:36,089 --> 00:05:36,888
Why not?

133
00:05:36,890 --> 00:05:38,089
Well, she's going through

134
00:05:38,091 --> 00:05:40,142
one of those phases where,
uh, the very touch of me

135
00:05:40,144 --> 00:05:41,259
fills her with revulsion.

136
00:05:41,261 --> 00:05:42,511
Um...

137
00:05:42,513 --> 00:05:44,629
I-I'm thinking it's premenopause.

138
00:05:44,631 --> 00:05:47,399
Yes, I'm sure that's why.

139
00:05:47,401 --> 00:05:48,683
Well, just so you know,

140
00:05:48,685 --> 00:05:50,902
I'm not putting my life on hold
while you're here.

141
00:05:50,904 --> 00:05:52,571
Oh, and I wouldn't expect you to.

142
00:05:52,573 --> 00:05:53,905
Just go on with your life.

143
00:05:53,907 --> 00:05:56,408
Do whatever it is you would do,
as if I weren't here.

144
00:05:56,410 --> 00:05:57,659
Well, I have a date tonight.

145
00:05:57,661 --> 00:05:58,977
Oh, great.

146
00:05:58,979 --> 00:06:01,496
We'll probably wind up having sex.

147
00:06:01,498 --> 00:06:03,165
Sure.

148
00:06:03,167 --> 00:06:04,499
Rough sex.

149
00:06:06,002 --> 00:06:07,652
Right.

150
00:06:07,654 --> 00:06:09,654
So, stay away from my bedroom.

151
00:06:09,656 --> 00:06:10,822
No problem.

152
00:06:10,824 --> 00:06:12,657
Even if you hear me screaming.

153
00:06:12,659 --> 00:06:14,543
Especially if I hear you screaming.

154
00:06:14,545 --> 00:06:18,013
Unless I'm repeatedly
screaming "umbrella."

155
00:06:18,015 --> 00:06:19,497
U-Umbrella?

156
00:06:19,499 --> 00:06:20,999
That's my safe word.

157
00:06:21,001 --> 00:06:24,769
Sometimes they can't hear it
through the leather mask.

158
00:06:27,523 --> 00:06:30,842

"I have a date tonight."

162
00:06:39,069 --> 00:06:41,519
that doesn't sting my eyes?

168
00:06:56,386 --> 00:06:58,202
will you take me back?

Hey, uh, what is
the toilet paper that we use?

Hey, Berta, will you
run to the supermarket

176
00:07:27,734 --> 00:07:29,834
and get me baby shampoo? Sure.

177
00:07:29,836 --> 00:07:33,421
Then I'll sit in the tub
with you and wash your hair.

Hey, everything's gonna be all right.

182
00:07:42,766 --> 00:07:44,516
Just wait and see.

183
00:07:44,518 --> 00:07:48,219
I've never felt so bad in my life.

184
00:07:50,056 --> 00:07:52,724
And I never felt so good.

185
00:07:56,228 --> 00:07:57,746
Don't!

186
00:07:58,931 --> 00:08:00,815
Stop!

187
00:08:02,618 --> 00:08:05,153
Don't!

188
00:08:05,155 --> 00:08:07,489
Stop!

189
00:08:07,491 --> 00:08:08,823
What are you doing?

190
00:08:08,825 --> 00:08:10,575
I said don't stop!

191
00:08:11,994 --> 00:08:14,612
I should be on the roof with a rifle.

192
00:08:18,117 --> 00:08:20,468
- Oh. Hey, Walden.
- Hey.

193
00:08:20,470 --> 00:08:22,620
Uh, you left some books in your room.

194
00:08:22,622 --> 00:08:23,922
Oh, thank you.

195
00:08:23,924 --> 00:08:26,124
Um, you didn't have to
drive all the way over here.

196
00:08:26,126 --> 00:08:27,926
Is it really possible
to hypnotize a woman

197
00:08:27,928 --> 00:08:29,144
and make her your slave?

198
00:08:29,146 --> 00:08:30,962
Oh.

199
00:08:30,964 --> 00:08:33,231
That was a, that was a
gag gift for my birthday.

200
00:08:34,434 --> 00:08:36,818
What about Ten Minutes a Day
to Incredible Wealth?

201
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:39,154
Oh, good, that's my poop book.

202
00:08:43,025 --> 00:08:44,859
Um, I'd invite you in,

203
00:08:44,861 --> 00:08:47,495
but my mom doesn't let
me have friends over.

204
00:08:47,497 --> 00:08:48,663
That's cool.

205
00:08:48,665 --> 00:08:51,315
Mm.

206
00:08:51,317 --> 00:08:53,501
You want to go out
and maybe do something?

207
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:55,120
What do you have in mind?

208
00:08:55,122 --> 00:08:56,671
Umbrella!

209
00:08:56,673 --> 00:08:57,789
Doesn't matter, let's go.

210
00:08:57,791 --> 00:08:59,991
Umbrella! Umbrella! Umbr...

211
00:09:03,629 --> 00:09:05,263
Nice car.

212
00:09:05,265 --> 00:09:06,348
What is it?

213
00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:08,166
It's an electric Fisker.

214
00:09:08,168 --> 00:09:10,051
State-of-the-art
lithium ion technology

215
00:09:10,053 --> 00:09:12,187
supplemented with a
turbo-charged engine.

216
00:09:12,189 --> 00:09:13,471
Solar panels on the roof.

217
00:09:13,473 --> 00:09:14,472
Oh, blue Volkswagen.

218
00:09:14,474 --> 00:09:15,657
Punchbug!

219
00:09:17,443 --> 00:09:19,861
So, how much does
something like this cost?

220
00:09:19,863 --> 00:09:21,512
About a hundred grand.

221
00:09:21,514 --> 00:09:22,847
It's great for the environment.

222
00:09:22,849 --> 00:09:25,116
I don't know why anyone
would drive anything else.

223
00:09:25,118 --> 00:09:28,119
Speaking for myself,
bone-crushing poverty

224
00:09:28,121 --> 00:09:30,405
is something of a stumbling block.

225
00:09:30,407 --> 00:09:31,990
Maybe you could lease.

226
00:09:33,358 --> 00:09:36,044
I got a confession to make, Alan.

227
00:09:36,046 --> 00:09:37,162
Me, too.

228
00:09:37,164 --> 00:09:40,165
The hypnotism book
wasn't really a gift.

229
00:09:40,167 --> 00:09:43,385
I really came over because...

230
00:09:43,387 --> 00:09:45,303
I was kind of lonely.

231
00:09:45,305 --> 00:09:46,638
Oh, sure, sure.

232
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:47,756
I been there.

233
00:09:47,758 --> 00:09:49,140
A lot.

234
00:09:49,142 --> 00:09:50,875
In fact, I'm there now.

235
00:09:50,877 --> 00:09:52,677
I've never really spent
much time alone.

236
00:09:52,679 --> 00:09:54,429
I've been with Bridget
since high school.

237
00:09:54,431 --> 00:09:57,015
Mm. High school sweethearts.

238
00:09:57,017 --> 00:09:58,433
When I was in high school,

239
00:09:58,435 --> 00:10:00,935
I was dating a poster
of Molly Ringwald.

240
00:10:02,688 --> 00:10:05,023
You know, back then,
she was crazy in love with me.

241
00:10:05,025 --> 00:10:06,908
I didn't even have any money then.

242
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:08,777
Oh, I'm sure she still loves you.

243
00:10:08,779 --> 00:10:10,895
No.

244
00:10:10,897 --> 00:10:13,248
She's changed.

245
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:15,533
Her heart has become cold and angry.

246
00:10:15,535 --> 00:10:18,703
Um, you're starting to go
a little fast there, buddy.

247
00:10:20,006 --> 00:10:22,006
I mean, who just wakes up
one day and all of a sudden

248
00:10:22,008 --> 00:10:23,241
decides they don't want
to be married anymore?

249
00:10:23,243 --> 00:10:25,627
Uh, well, actually,
it only seems that way.

250
00:10:25,629 --> 00:10:26,911
In my experience,

251
00:10:26,913 --> 00:10:29,297
they've been mulling it over
for quite a while.

252
00:10:29,299 --> 00:10:32,467
Uh, you know, the speed limit
is 35, and you're going,

253
00:10:32,469 --> 00:10:33,918
oh, oh, 80.

254
00:10:35,522 --> 00:10:37,305
I mean, what ever happened
to till death do us part?

255
00:10:37,307 --> 00:10:38,473
Yeah, who died?

256
00:10:38,475 --> 00:10:39,641
Not you, not her.

257
00:10:39,643 --> 00:10:41,276
Oh, good golly, 95.

258
00:10:42,312 --> 00:10:43,528
Whoa! Whoa!

259
00:10:43,530 --> 00:10:45,146
This thing really takes the corners.

260
00:10:45,148 --> 00:10:47,148
I love her, Alan, and I want her back.

261
00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:48,149
Well, I know you do.

262
00:10:48,151 --> 00:10:49,451
Oh, 103, Walden, 103.

263
00:10:49,453 --> 00:10:52,153
Life is not worth
living without Bridget!

264
00:10:52,155 --> 00:10:53,538
Truck, truck, truck!

265
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:55,773
It hurts so much, I
can't take it anymore!

266
00:10:55,775 --> 00:10:57,158
Umbrella!

267
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:58,393
♪ Men. ♪

268
00:11:01,582 --> 00:11:02,782
♪ Men. ♪

269
00:11:02,808 --> 00:11:05,610
I'm sorry I scared you
by driving so fast.

270
00:11:06,796 --> 00:11:08,447
That's okay.

271
00:11:08,449 --> 00:11:11,967
I'm sorry I peed a little
on your seat.

272
00:11:13,353 --> 00:11:15,343
Where are we?

273
00:11:15,344 --> 00:11:16,777
We're going to my house.

274
00:11:16,779 --> 00:11:18,723
I got to talk Bridget
into taking me back.

275
00:11:18,724 --> 00:11:19,673
Oh, no.

276
00:11:19,675 --> 00:11:21,141
No, no, bad idea.

277
00:11:21,143 --> 00:11:23,560
When a woman says she doesn't
want you, begging does not help.

278
00:11:23,562 --> 00:11:25,679
And I say this having spent
more time on my knees

279
00:11:25,681 --> 00:11:27,180
than any straight man in America.

280
00:11:27,182 --> 00:11:30,066
What is this, a gated community?

281
00:11:30,068 --> 00:11:32,769
No, it's just my house.

282
00:11:32,771 --> 00:11:33,770
Wow.

283
00:11:33,772 --> 00:11:35,271
Instead of going
to chiropractor school,

284
00:11:35,273 --> 00:11:36,806
I should have married a billionaire.

285
00:11:36,808 --> 00:11:39,025
Next time, you'll know.

286
00:11:41,362 --> 00:11:43,163
What are you doing here, Walden?

287
00:11:43,165 --> 00:11:45,165
I just want to talk to you.

288
00:11:45,167 --> 00:11:47,000
Go away or I'll call the police!

289
00:11:47,002 --> 00:11:48,918
"Go away or I'll call the police."

290
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:50,987
Man, that takes me back.

291
00:11:50,989 --> 00:11:53,656
Um, what do you say I drive us home?

292
00:11:53,658 --> 00:11:54,758
How about that?

293
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:56,176
I'm not giving up that easy.

294
00:11:56,178 --> 00:11:57,594
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

295
00:11:57,596 --> 00:11:58,712
W-Where...?

296
00:11:58,714 --> 00:12:00,764
You heard what she said
about the police, right?

297
00:12:00,766 --> 00:12:02,999
I'm going to get my wife back.
Come on.

298
00:12:03,001 --> 00:12:04,667
Come on? What's my part in this?

299
00:12:04,669 --> 00:12:06,603
I need you to help me over the gate.

300
00:12:06,605 --> 00:12:07,604
O-Okay.

301
00:12:07,606 --> 00:12:09,606
Again, voice of experience here.

302
00:12:09,608 --> 00:12:13,059
Criminal trespass usually ends
with her dating the cop.

303
00:12:13,061 --> 00:12:15,061
Will you just come on.

304
00:12:17,983 --> 00:12:19,348
Here, give me a hand.

305
00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:21,785
Here, let me go. I'm going this way.

306
00:12:21,787 --> 00:12:23,453
I got it. I got it.

307
00:12:24,372 --> 00:12:25,572
Okay, okay. I got it.

308
00:12:25,574 --> 00:12:28,241
Good luck.

309
00:12:28,243 --> 00:12:29,525
Come on.

310
00:12:29,527 --> 00:12:32,028
Again, come on?

311
00:12:32,030 --> 00:12:34,047
I may need your help
getting in a window.

312
00:12:34,049 --> 00:12:35,415
Oh, terrific.

313
00:12:35,417 --> 00:12:37,167
Now I'm Spider-Man.

314
00:12:38,969 --> 00:12:40,336
I got you.

315
00:12:43,591 --> 00:12:46,392
Walden, do not make me
turn that gate on.

316
00:12:46,394 --> 00:12:48,478
W-What does that mean?

317
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:49,729
Turn the gate on?

318
00:12:49,731 --> 00:12:51,548
Don't worry, she's bluffing.

319
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:09,899
I still have a buzzing in my ears.

320
00:13:09,901 --> 00:13:13,286
I can't hear you, I have
a buzzing in my ears.

321
00:13:13,288 --> 00:13:15,955
God, Walden, what is wrong with you?

322
00:13:15,957 --> 00:13:20,009
Well, if loving you is wrong, then...

323
00:13:20,011 --> 00:13:22,245
I am wrong.

324
00:13:22,247 --> 00:13:23,930
It's true.

325
00:13:23,932 --> 00:13:25,882
He talks about you all the time.

326
00:13:27,219 --> 00:13:29,385
Okay, I expect
this kind of thing from him;

327
00:13:29,387 --> 00:13:31,437
he has the emotional maturity
of a 12-year-old.

328
00:13:31,439 --> 00:13:32,705
What's your excuse?

329
00:13:32,707 --> 00:13:34,808
Uh, I live at my mom's,
and she's having

330
00:13:34,810 --> 00:13:38,077
rough sex with a stranger, and
I had to get out of the house.

331
00:13:39,697 --> 00:13:43,783
Honey, I just don't understand
why we can't work things out.

332
00:13:43,785 --> 00:13:45,902
Okay, I'll tell you again.

333
00:13:45,904 --> 00:13:47,904
Oh, this part is never good.

334
00:13:47,906 --> 00:13:50,740
I'm tired of living with a child.

335
00:13:50,742 --> 00:13:53,693
I'm tired of being
more of a mother than a wife.

336
00:13:53,695 --> 00:13:55,161
Whoa, oh, whoa, whoa.

337
00:13:55,163 --> 00:13:57,413
You are not more of
a mother than a wife.

338
00:13:57,415 --> 00:13:58,904
Really? Who picks out your clothes?

339
00:13:58,929 --> 00:14:00,000
You.

340
00:14:00,001 --> 00:14:01,212
Who tells you when to go to sleep?

341
00:14:01,237 --> 00:14:02,437
You.

342
00:14:02,554 --> 00:14:04,420
Who does all the cooking
and cleaning around here?

343
00:14:04,422 --> 00:14:06,289
The cooking and the cleaning ladies.

344
00:14:06,291 --> 00:14:07,456
Before we were rich!

345
00:14:07,458 --> 00:14:09,676
You.

346
00:14:09,678 --> 00:14:13,012
Look, Walden, you're a sweet guy

347
00:14:13,014 --> 00:14:15,431
and I'll always love you,

348
00:14:15,433 --> 00:14:17,851
but I can't live
with Peter Pan anymore.

349
00:14:17,853 --> 00:14:20,236
Uh, now, now, to be fair,

350
00:14:20,238 --> 00:14:22,471
uh, Peter Pan didn't want to grow up.

351
00:14:22,473 --> 00:14:25,992
Uh, from what I understand,
Walden's just never had to.

352
00:14:27,077 --> 00:14:29,362
Sorry.

353
00:14:29,364 --> 00:14:33,482
Seemed important up here.

354
00:14:33,484 --> 00:14:37,120
Down here, not so much.

355
00:14:38,756 --> 00:14:41,624
Bridget, believe me, I can grow up.

356
00:14:41,626 --> 00:14:42,792
Oh, please.

357
00:14:42,794 --> 00:14:44,660
At least give me a chance to try.

358
00:14:47,182 --> 00:14:49,215
I gave you 15 years.

359
00:14:49,217 --> 00:14:51,050
It's over!

360
00:14:51,052 --> 00:14:53,269
Okay.

361
00:14:54,722 --> 00:14:56,105
Can I at least play

362
00:14:56,107 --> 00:14:58,057
a little Donkey Kong
with Alan before I go?

363
00:14:58,059 --> 00:14:59,142
Are you insane?

364
00:14:59,144 --> 00:15:00,143
Get out!

365
00:15:00,145 --> 00:15:02,028
Oh, yeah, fine, I'm insane!

366
00:15:03,064 --> 00:15:05,148
Come on, Alan!

367
00:15:05,150 --> 00:15:08,034
Thank you for the water and the...

368
00:15:09,787 --> 00:15:12,121
Hold on.

369
00:15:14,626 --> 00:15:16,142
Let's go.

370
00:15:22,883 --> 00:15:26,052
Where does she get off
calling me a child?

371
00:15:26,054 --> 00:15:29,138
Um, you seem a little upset;
maybe I should drive us. Um...

372
00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:30,924
She is a stupid-head.

373
00:15:30,926 --> 00:15:32,592
Oh, oh, white Volkswagen. Huh?

374
00:15:32,594 --> 00:15:34,093
Huh? Come on.

375
00:15:35,930 --> 00:15:37,263
Oh, wait, wait, I've got an idea.

376
00:15:37,265 --> 00:15:39,382
Why don't we stop,
have a drink and talk about it.

377
00:15:39,384 --> 00:15:41,267
Drinking is not the answer.

378
00:15:41,269 --> 00:15:44,720
No, stopping is the answer!

379
00:15:46,941 --> 00:15:49,725
Oh, dear God,
where is that toilet paper?

380
00:16:29,099 --> 00:16:31,067
Oh, boy.

381
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,441
Alan?

382
00:16:38,443 --> 00:16:41,411
Yeah?

383
00:16:41,413 --> 00:16:44,580
Why are you lying on top of me?

384
00:16:44,582 --> 00:16:47,800
'Cause I didn't want
to be on the bottom?

385
00:16:51,555 --> 00:16:53,656
I think we're naked.

386
00:16:53,658 --> 00:16:56,792
Yeah. You can ignore
what's going on down there.

387
00:16:58,512 --> 00:17:00,763
That was a morning reflex.

388
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:04,434
Could you get it off of me, please?

389
00:17:04,436 --> 00:17:07,353
Absolutely. Absolutely.

390
00:17:11,775 --> 00:17:13,242
Do you remember anything?

391
00:17:13,244 --> 00:17:14,527
Uh...

392
00:17:14,529 --> 00:17:17,980
we went to a liquor store,
and then we came back here.

393
00:17:19,817 --> 00:17:21,817
Then we went skinny dipping.

394
00:17:21,819 --> 00:17:22,869
Right, right.

395
00:17:22,871 --> 00:17:24,156
Whose idea was that?

396
00:17:24,256 --> 00:17:25,755
Mine.

397
00:17:26,374 --> 00:17:28,941
Shh.

398
00:17:32,012 --> 00:17:34,080
♪ Men. ♪

399
00:17:35,549 --> 00:17:38,217
Okay, your pants are clean.

400
00:17:38,219 --> 00:17:39,969
Thank you.

401
00:17:39,971 --> 00:17:43,189
Two words for you... adult diapers.

402
00:17:43,191 --> 00:17:46,025
Look, Walden was driving
ridiculously fast,

403
00:17:46,027 --> 00:17:47,777
and-and I have a nervous bladder.

404
00:17:47,779 --> 00:17:48,895
Save it, Zippy.

405
00:17:48,897 --> 00:17:51,831
This is not my first
pee stain rodeo with you.

406
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:57,537
Hi. Is Charlie here?

407
00:17:57,539 --> 00:17:59,322
Oh, God, another one.

408
00:17:59,324 --> 00:18:02,241
You deal with it.

409
00:18:02,243 --> 00:18:04,710
Um, hi.
I'm-I'm Charlie's brother Alan.

410
00:18:04,712 --> 00:18:05,711
I'm Penelope.

411
00:18:05,713 --> 00:18:06,879
Is he here?

412
00:18:07,081 --> 00:18:09,882
Uh, maybe you better sit down.

413
00:18:09,884 --> 00:18:11,700
Is-Is everything okay?

414
00:18:11,702 --> 00:18:13,886
Um, no.

415
00:18:13,888 --> 00:18:17,540
Penelope, the-the thing is,
uh, Charlie passed away.

416
00:18:17,542 --> 00:18:19,092
What?

417
00:18:19,094 --> 00:18:20,843
It was very sudden.

418
00:18:20,845 --> 00:18:22,645
Oh, my God.

419
00:18:22,647 --> 00:18:24,730
I'm sorry, he was just
such a terrific guy.

420
00:18:24,732 --> 00:18:26,149
I can't believe he's gone.

421
00:18:26,151 --> 00:18:28,501
Hey, what's going on?

422
00:18:28,503 --> 00:18:31,604
Hello, I'm Penelope.

423
00:18:31,606 --> 00:18:33,940
Hi. I'm Walden.

424
00:18:33,942 --> 00:18:35,274
What are you crying about?

425
00:18:35,276 --> 00:18:37,176
I have no idea.

426
00:18:37,178 --> 00:18:39,779
Don't worry about me,
I'll let myself out.

427
00:18:40,614 --> 00:18:41,781
You smell good.

428
00:18:41,783 --> 00:18:44,534
Oh, thank you. It's baby shampoo.

429
00:18:44,536 --> 00:18:46,302
"What are you crying about?"

430
00:18:46,304 --> 00:18:48,621
"I have no idea."

431
00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:53,259
Oh, Bridget. Hi.

432
00:18:53,261 --> 00:18:54,510
Hi.

433
00:18:54,512 --> 00:18:55,911
I came to talk to Walden.

434
00:18:55,913 --> 00:18:56,796
Really?

435
00:18:56,798 --> 00:18:57,797
Yeah, I think maybe

436
00:18:57,799 --> 00:18:59,549
I've been a little hard on him.

437
00:18:59,551 --> 00:19:02,101
Well, um...

438
00:19:02,103 --> 00:19:03,102
Bridget?

439
00:19:03,104 --> 00:19:04,854
Hey.

440
00:19:04,856 --> 00:19:06,205
Walden?

441
00:19:06,207 --> 00:19:08,107
Look who came to talk to you, Walden.

442
00:19:08,109 --> 00:19:09,108
Your wife.

443
00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:10,776
You're married?

444
00:19:10,778 --> 00:19:12,061
Oh, yeah, long time married.

445
00:19:12,063 --> 00:19:13,095
Uh, they just met.

446
00:19:13,097 --> 00:19:14,780
This is Penelope, my girlfriend.

447
00:19:14,782 --> 00:19:16,983
What? Shut up and walk.

448
00:19:19,536 --> 00:19:20,720
I'm-I'm glad you came.

449
00:19:20,722 --> 00:19:22,155
Come, sit-sit down.

450
00:19:22,157 --> 00:19:24,574
When I saw you with that girl,

451
00:19:24,576 --> 00:19:26,576
I thought that maybe she was with you.

452
00:19:27,778 --> 00:19:29,412
You're kidding, right?

453
00:19:29,414 --> 00:19:31,581
I mean, come on,
Alan's the ladies' man.

454
00:19:31,583 --> 00:19:32,798
He's a total pickup artist.

455
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:33,949
Come on!

456
00:19:33,951 --> 00:19:35,819
Charlie's dead, Walden's married,

457
00:19:35,821 --> 00:19:37,388
what's wrong with me?

458
00:19:39,690 --> 00:19:41,858
♪ Men. ♪

459
00:19:43,048 --> 00:19:44,299
♪ Men. ♪

460
00:19:44,589 --> 00:19:45,671
So, I was thinking

461
00:19:46,773 --> 00:19:48,406
we could go out to dinner sometime.

462
00:19:48,408 --> 00:19:49,910
Let me prove that I can change.

463
00:19:49,910 --> 00:19:51,476
I can be a grown-up.

464
00:19:51,495 --> 00:19:53,461
I guess I owe you that much.

465
00:19:53,463 --> 00:19:55,830
Sweet!

466
00:19:56,866 --> 00:19:58,933
Sorry to interrupt.

467
00:19:59,135 --> 00:20:01,719
I was just on a little jog
with my lady.

468
00:20:01,721 --> 00:20:03,238
Uh, I'll, uh,

469
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:04,572
get out of your way.

470
00:20:04,574 --> 00:20:06,207
Uh, hold on.

471
00:20:06,209 --> 00:20:09,210
I'm-I'm going to say
good-bye to my guest,

472
00:20:09,212 --> 00:20:11,997
because that's the grown-up
thing to do, right?

473
00:20:18,587 --> 00:20:20,055
Alan, thank you.

474
00:20:20,057 --> 00:20:21,706
You saved my butt back there.

475
00:20:21,708 --> 00:20:23,675
Oh, I'm glad things are working out.

476
00:20:23,677 --> 00:20:24,726
I owe you big-time.

477
00:20:24,728 --> 00:20:26,177
If there's anything that you need,

478
00:20:26,179 --> 00:20:28,947
any way I can help you,
you just let me know.

479
00:20:30,733 --> 00:20:35,437
Well, since you mention it,
you could do me a little favor.

480
00:20:35,439 --> 00:20:36,404
Name it.

481
00:20:36,406 --> 00:20:38,023
Well, really uncomfortable

482
00:20:38,025 --> 00:20:39,157
living at my mom's.

483
00:20:39,159 --> 00:20:41,609
Um, do you think I could
stay here for a few days

484
00:20:41,611 --> 00:20:42,894
till I find my own place?

485
00:20:42,896 --> 00:20:44,162
No problem.

486
00:20:44,164 --> 00:20:46,064
Few days, couple weeks.

487
00:20:46,066 --> 00:20:47,082
Yeah, done.

488
00:20:47,084 --> 00:20:49,400
Month, tops.

489
00:20:49,402 --> 00:20:50,869
Whatever.

490
00:20:50,871 --> 00:20:52,236
Great, great. Thanks.

491
00:20:52,238 --> 00:20:53,621
And, uh, and don't worry,

492
00:20:53,623 --> 00:20:55,340
I'm not one to overstay my welcome.

493
00:20:55,342 --> 00:20:56,541
Cool.

494
00:21:00,329 --> 00:21:01,663
I'm back.
