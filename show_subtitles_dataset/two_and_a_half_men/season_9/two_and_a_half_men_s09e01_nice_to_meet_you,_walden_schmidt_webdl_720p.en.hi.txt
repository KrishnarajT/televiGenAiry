I'm Charlie's brother Alan.

I want to thank you all

I know this is

00:00:14,054 --> 00:00:16,037
a very sad day
for all of us.

8

Speak for yourself.

9
00:00:19,058 --> 00:00:20,475
Okay.

10

Uh, I understand that some of
you have "mixed feelings."

11
00:00:26,016 --> 00:00:29,901
Um... but I think
we can all agree

12
00:00:29,903 --> 00:00:32,020
that Charlie lived life
to its fullest

13
00:00:32,022 --> 00:00:34,222
and-and gave it
everything he had.

14
00:00:34,224 --> 00:00:35,907
Gave me herpes.

15
00:00:37,559 --> 00:00:39,410
Chlamydia.

16
00:00:39,412 --> 00:00:41,246
Vaginal warts.

17
00:00:43,065 --> 00:00:46,201
Excuse me, this is my dead
son we're talking about.

18
00:00:46,203 --> 00:00:49,537
I loved him and I'm
devastated that he's gone,

19
00:00:49,539 --> 00:00:53,341
leaving me with nothing but
my memories and my regrets

20
00:00:53,343 --> 00:00:55,627
and the listing for his
beautiful beachfront

21
00:00:55,629 --> 00:00:57,578
Malibu getaway
with three bedrooms

22
00:00:57,580 --> 00:00:59,180

a half baths

Thank you, Mom.

26
00:01:08,975 --> 00:01:10,391
Um, anyway...

27
00:01:10,393 --> 00:01:13,261
Open house is Sunday,
1:00 to 5:00.

28
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:16,597
Okay.

29
00:01:16,599 --> 00:01:20,985
Um, I'd like to take a moment
to talk about my brother,

30
00:01:20,987 --> 00:01:23,621
um, and his incredible love
for life.

31
00:01:23,623 --> 00:01:26,157
He also loved being spanked.

32
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:28,442
While wearing
my panties.

33
00:01:29,578 --> 00:01:32,080
He used my panties to make tea.

34
00:01:36,785 --> 00:01:41,622
M-My point is, um, that Charlie
lived life on his own terms

35
00:01:41,624 --> 00:01:45,009
and-and never apologized
for who he was.

36
00:01:45,011 --> 00:01:46,311
Yeah, blah,
blah, blah.

37
00:01:46,313 --> 00:01:48,079
Why can't we
see the body?

38
00:01:49,631 --> 00:01:52,350
Yeah, I didn't come all this way
to spit on a closed coffin.

39
00:01:52,352 --> 00:01:54,302
Okay, I understand how you feel,

40
00:01:54,304 --> 00:01:57,572
but unfortunately due to the
circumstances of his passing,

41
00:01:57,574 --> 00:02:01,492
the remains aren't exactly...
spit-able.

42
00:02:01,494 --> 00:02:03,995
I have a question.

43
00:02:03,997 --> 00:02:05,530
O-Okay.

44
00:02:05,532 --> 00:02:08,249
Uh, I wasn't planning on
doing a Q and A,

45
00:02:08,251 --> 00:02:09,584
uh, but go ahead.

46
00:02:09,586 --> 00:02:11,085
Thank you.

47
00:02:11,087 --> 00:02:13,955
Charlie owes me $38,000
for some,

48
00:02:13,957 --> 00:02:15,673
let's say, pharmaceuticals.

49
00:02:17,092 --> 00:02:19,260
Who do I talk to about that?

50
00:02:19,262 --> 00:02:21,763
Uh, well, I think
that's something

51
00:02:21,765 --> 00:02:23,431
you'll have to discuss
with the lawyers.

52
00:02:23,433 --> 00:02:24,465
Yeah.

53
00:02:24,467 --> 00:02:27,018
I'd rather not involve the law.

54
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:31,222
And now, uh, I thought
we'd take this moment

55
00:02:31,224 --> 00:02:34,675
to hear from the person who was
with Charlie at the end.

56
00:02:44,787 --> 00:02:46,454
Thank you, Alan.

57
00:02:48,157 --> 00:02:50,959
Charlie Harper was
the love of my life

58
00:02:50,961 --> 00:02:53,161
and a wonderful, wonderful man.

59
00:02:53,163 --> 00:02:55,163
Selfish pig.

60
00:02:56,715 --> 00:03:00,301
Sure, our relationship had
its ups and downs

61
00:03:00,303 --> 00:03:02,420
and the occasional
restraining order.

62
00:03:02,422 --> 00:03:03,972
But at the end,

63
00:03:03,974 --> 00:03:09,077
we ran away together to Paris,
where he asked me to marry him.

64
00:03:09,079 --> 00:03:10,945
I said yes.

65
00:03:10,947 --> 00:03:14,816
And the next few days
were the happiest of my life.

66
00:03:14,818 --> 00:03:16,484
Nothing could spoil it.

67
00:03:16,486 --> 00:03:18,403
Not even when I came home
from shopping

68
00:03:18,405 --> 00:03:21,172
and found him taking a shower
with another woman.

69
00:03:22,225 --> 00:03:25,226
That's our Charlie.

70
00:03:26,895 --> 00:03:29,397
But I forgave him

71
00:03:29,399 --> 00:03:32,634
because I loved him
unconditionally.

72
00:03:32,636 --> 00:03:36,237
So you can imagine my horror
when, the very next day,

73
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:37,622
he slipped on the Metro platform

74
00:03:37,624 --> 00:03:39,841
and fell in front of
an oncoming train.

75
00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:44,128
Never cross a
crazy woman.

76
00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:48,433
I just want you all to know
that Charlie didn't suffer.

77
00:03:48,435 --> 00:03:52,787
His body just exploded
like a balloon full of meat.

78
00:03:53,922 --> 00:03:56,541
Thank you.

79
00:04:00,863 --> 00:04:02,063

I needed a day off,
"Sure, Berta, no problem."

88
00:04:23,225 --> 00:04:24,591

was clean sheets

00:04:31,384 --> 00:04:35,803
and hosing the vomit off the
occasional drug-addled hooker.

Well, there's virtually no money
in Charlie's estate,

97
00:04:49,618 --> 00:04:52,069
but I'll be happy to pay you
once the house sells.

98

Oh, please. Charlie had
three mortgages on this place.

00:08:44,953 --> 00:08:50,424
and I will always be grateful
for you taking Jake and me in,

181
00:08:50,426 --> 00:08:53,577
letting us live here
all these years.

182
00:08:55,430 --> 00:08:59,466
So, now the question is...

183
00:08:59,468 --> 00:09:01,985
what do we do with you?

184
00:09:01,987 --> 00:09:05,489
I know what you said
you wanted, but...

185
00:09:05,491 --> 00:09:07,608
I really don't think
Pamela Anderson will agree

186
00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:09,809
to swallow your ashes.

187
00:09:12,530 --> 00:09:15,782
Um, I-I could take you with me
to live at Mom's,

188
00:09:15,784 --> 00:09:18,552
but that's how
horror movies start.

189
00:09:22,123 --> 00:09:24,007
Hey.

190
00:09:24,009 --> 00:09:27,177
Maybe I could sprinkle you
on the beach.

191
00:09:27,179 --> 00:09:29,663
I mean, it's simple,
it's dignified,

192
00:09:29,665 --> 00:09:31,515
and pretty girls
covered with oil

193
00:09:31,517 --> 00:09:35,018
will be sitting on you all day.

194
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:37,187
Kind of like your life.

195
00:09:39,006 --> 00:09:41,191
Except for the dignified part.

196
00:09:43,861 --> 00:09:46,513
All right.

197
00:09:48,033 --> 00:09:50,200
Well...

198
00:09:53,188 --> 00:09:56,373
I guess now is
as good a time as any.

199
00:10:09,504 --> 00:10:11,088

Yeah, I'm fine.

207
00:10:25,886 --> 00:10:28,586
I was just trying
to drown myself.

208
00:10:28,588 --> 00:10:30,722
Wait, you-you tried
to commit suicide?

209
00:10:30,724 --> 00:10:34,592
Yeah. But I had no idea that
the water would be that cold.

210
00:10:36,011 --> 00:10:37,312
Suppose I could've
worn a wet suit,

211
00:10:37,314 --> 00:10:39,714
but who tries to commit suicide
in a wet suit, right?

212
00:10:40,966 --> 00:10:42,067
That phone right there?

213
00:10:42,069 --> 00:10:43,101
Oh, yeah, yeah.

214
00:10:43,103 --> 00:10:45,320
Thank you.

215
00:10:45,322 --> 00:10:47,072
Uh, you got a towel?

00:10:47,074 --> 00:10:48,473
Oh, sure.

217
00:10:48,475 --> 00:10:50,808
Thanks.

218
00:10:54,646 --> 00:10:56,831
Hi. It's me.

219
00:10:58,451 --> 00:11:01,169
I want you to know that I just
flung myself in the ocean

220
00:11:01,171 --> 00:11:03,371
'cause I can't live without you.

221
00:11:04,673 --> 00:11:07,876
No, I'm not calling you
from the ocean.

222
00:11:08,844 --> 00:11:10,995
Because it was cold.

223
00:11:10,997 --> 00:11:13,515
I don't...
I'm in some guy's house.

224
00:11:13,517 --> 00:11:14,832
Um, Alan Harper.

225
00:11:14,834 --> 00:11:17,185
I am in Alan
Harper's house.

226
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:20,472
How about it?
Will you take me back?

227
00:11:20,474 --> 00:11:23,274
Are you sure?

228
00:11:23,276 --> 00:11:26,444
You heard what I said
about the ocean, right?

229
00:11:28,564 --> 00:11:30,698
Okay, fine.
I'll stop bothering you.

230
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:34,152
But I want you to know that I
will love you forever and ever.

231
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:36,287
Really?

232
00:11:36,289 --> 00:11:37,772
That bothers you?

233
00:11:39,525 --> 00:11:42,744
Okay. Bye.

234
00:11:44,696 --> 00:11:46,297
You got a wet suit?

235
00:11:46,299 --> 00:11:48,917
Oh, come on.
It... it can't be that bad.

236
00:11:48,919 --> 00:11:50,935
It could be.
You don't know.

237
00:11:51,804 --> 00:11:53,704
No, no, I do.

238

241
00:11:59,896 --> 00:12:02,730
uh, rejected,
friendless, broke.

I'm not broke.

243
00:12:03,934 --> 00:12:05,716

Beg pardon?

245
00:12:08,605 --> 00:12:12,223
1.3 is what her lawyer says,
but I would give up every penny

246

if she would take me back.

247
00:12:15,027 --> 00:12:17,579
No, no, no.
You don't want to do that.

248
00:12:17,581 --> 00:12:21,749
Uh... I think you can find a lot
of girls for way less money.

249
00:12:21,751 --> 00:12:23,084
I don't want other girls.

250
00:12:23,086 --> 00:12:24,402
I want Bridget.

251
00:12:24,404 --> 00:12:26,070
Right. Right.

252
00:12:26,072 --> 00:12:27,839
Um, just to clarify, um,

253
00:12:27,841 --> 00:12:31,292
did you say "billion"
with a "buh?"

254
00:12:32,462 --> 00:12:33,962
Listen, trust me.

255
00:12:33,964 --> 00:12:35,964
Money does not
buy happiness.

256
00:12:35,966 --> 00:12:38,816
I wouldn't know.
I've never had either.

257
00:12:39,635 --> 00:12:41,553
Come on.
You're doing all right.

258
00:12:41,555 --> 00:12:43,555
You're living in
a beach house in Malibu.

259
00:12:43,557 --> 00:12:44,639
I have to sell it.

260
00:12:44,641 --> 00:12:46,341
And it's not even mine;
it's his.

261
00:12:48,577 --> 00:12:50,562

Yeah. I'm just going to go back
to my hotel room

272
00:13:08,882 --> 00:13:11,833
and update my Facebook status
to "not dead yet."

273
00:13:11,835 --> 00:13:14,002
Wait, wait, wait. I...
I just went to one funeral.

274
00:13:14,004 --> 00:13:15,970
I-I don't want to be involved
in another one.

275
00:13:15,972 --> 00:13:20,091
Why don't you and I go out
and have a drink and talk?

276
00:13:20,093 --> 00:13:22,126
About what?

277
00:13:22,128 --> 00:13:23,628

then they bundled it

00:16:44,997 --> 00:16:47,381
If anything,
she treated them

358
00:16:47,383 --> 00:16:50,000
with tenderness
and respect.

359
00:16:50,886 --> 00:16:53,003
Okay. Okay,
just for tonight,

360
00:16:53,005 --> 00:16:54,722
will you... will you
forget about Bridget

361
00:16:54,724 --> 00:16:56,507
and-and just try
to meet somebody new?

362
00:16:56,509 --> 00:16:58,142
Like who?

363
00:16:58,144 --> 00:16:59,944
I don't know.

364
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:03,781
How about...
how about her?

365
00:17:03,783 --> 00:17:05,233
Really?

366
00:17:05,235 --> 00:17:06,651
What would I say?

367
00:17:06,653 --> 00:17:11,322
Uh, well, I would not lead
with the testicle anecdote.

368
00:17:13,158 --> 00:17:15,209
Just... just say hi.

369
00:17:15,211 --> 00:17:17,161
Okay.

370
00:17:17,163 --> 00:17:18,880
Hi.

371
00:17:18,882 --> 00:17:20,331
Hi.

372
00:17:20,333 --> 00:17:23,384
- I'm Walden.
- Kelly.

373
00:17:30,175 --> 00:17:31,809
So, Kelly...

374
00:17:37,266 --> 00:17:42,887
My... wife dumped me,
and I want to die.

375
00:17:44,990 --> 00:17:47,008
Oh, you poor baby.

376
00:17:48,727 --> 00:17:52,997
I love her so much.

377
00:17:54,416 --> 00:17:55,833
I... I don't...

378
00:17:55,835 --> 00:17:58,119
Whew! I don't know...

379
00:17:58,121 --> 00:18:01,088
if I can ever
love anyone

380
00:18:01,090 --> 00:18:03,591
the way
that I love her.

381
00:18:06,912 --> 00:18:10,047
That's the most beautiful thing
that I've ever heard.

382
00:18:11,383 --> 00:18:14,919
Oh, it'll be okay.

383
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:28,366

Nice.

388
00:18:36,075 --> 00:18:38,893
Just me and my broken heart.

389
00:18:39,878 --> 00:18:43,047
Alan, I... I think
I should go back to my hotel.

390
00:18:43,049 --> 00:18:44,549
Are you nuts?

391
00:18:44,551 --> 00:18:46,050
We're doing great.

392
00:18:46,052 --> 00:18:48,920
This crap about loving
our exes is gold.

393
00:18:48,922 --> 00:18:50,721
My brother
would be so proud.

the DustBuster?

395
00:18:53,593 --> 00:18:55,309
Yeah.

396
00:18:55,311 --> 00:18:58,462
Ah. Uh, ladies, uh,
who's up for a libation?

397
00:18:58,464 --> 00:18:59,814
- A what?
- Huh?

398
00:18:59,816 --> 00:19:01,816
A... a drink... alcohol.

399
00:19:01,818 --> 00:19:03,434
- Sure.
- Great.

400
00:19:03,436 --> 00:19:05,987
Oh. Be right back.

401
00:19:12,310 --> 00:19:13,661
What's upstairs?

402
00:19:13,663 --> 00:19:16,146
I don't know.
Probably a bedroom.

403
00:19:16,148 --> 00:19:18,583
Why don't we
go find out?

404
00:19:18,585 --> 00:19:20,184
Uh... okay.

405
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:24,154
Hey, shouldn't we tell Alan
where we're going?

406
00:19:24,156 --> 00:19:26,007
No.
No.

407
00:19:28,010 --> 00:19:30,160
Who's ready for margaritas?

408
00:19:30,963 --> 00:19:32,329
Wow!

409
00:19:32,331 --> 00:19:35,850
One at a time, ladies!
One at a time.

410
00:19:37,837 --> 00:19:40,504
Well, this is depressingly
familiar.

Guess what.

I had sex with two girls
last night.

421
00:20:12,914 --> 00:20:17,350
Great. Um, I masturbated
and cried myself to sleep.

I dig your house,

Oh, okay.

He's going to
buy the house.
