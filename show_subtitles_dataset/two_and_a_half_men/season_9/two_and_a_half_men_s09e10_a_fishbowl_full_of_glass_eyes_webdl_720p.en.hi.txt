Yeah, "organic" is, uh, no
antibiotics or growth hormones,

46
00:01:46,401 --> 00:01:48,234
but it can still be
force-fed grain, which produces

47
00:01:48,236 --> 00:01:50,153

than cows that are allowed

00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:17,947
No!

178
00:07:22,703 --> 00:07:25,839
I'll give you $2.00
to clean it up.

179
00:07:26,674 --> 00:07:29,626
Where's your broom?

180

♪ Men. ♪

181
00:07:33,431 --> 00:07:34,931
Jake, I'm ready to go!

00:07:34,933 --> 00:07:37,601
JAKE:
Coming!

183
00:07:37,603 --> 00:07:39,469
Here you go, sir.
The car is charged, washed,

184
00:07:39,471 --> 00:07:41,321
and I put an air freshener
under your seat

185
00:07:41,323 --> 00:07:43,607
just in case you
let one slip out.

186

Good job.

187
00:07:45,744 --> 00:07:47,944
Hundred bucks! Thanks, boss.

188
00:07:51,332 --> 00:07:53,333
You gave him $100?

189
00:07:53,335 --> 00:07:55,702
Oh, hey, Alan.
Yeah, he washed my car.

190
00:07:55,704 --> 00:07:57,954
A hundred bucks
to wash a car?

191
00:07:57,956 --> 00:07:59,489
Not enough?

192
00:07:59,491 --> 00:08:02,626
For $100,
I'd lick your car clean.

193
00:08:02,628 --> 00:08:04,544
Maybe next time.

194
00:08:06,214 --> 00:08:07,848
Hey, I'm going on
a date with that girl

195
00:08:07,850 --> 00:08:09,633
I met in at supermarket.
Do I look okay?

196
00:08:09,635 --> 00:08:10,833
No, I look okay.

197
00:08:10,835 --> 00:08:12,719
You look like the guy
women fantasize about

198
00:08:12,721 --> 00:08:14,554
when I'm on top of them.

199
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:20,009
Listen, I-I know you're still
pretty new to the dating world,

200
00:08:20,011 --> 00:08:21,695
but can I give you
a little advice?

201
00:08:21,697 --> 00:08:22,845
Is this about condoms?

202
00:08:22,847 --> 00:08:24,564
'Cause Jake already
gave me his lucky one.

203
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,518
No. Uh...

204
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:31,020
If you hope to have any
kind of shot with this woman,

205
00:08:31,022 --> 00:08:32,989
you, uh, might want to
lose the wedding ring.

206
00:08:32,991 --> 00:08:34,741
Really?

207
00:08:34,743 --> 00:08:35,742
Oh yeah.

208
00:08:35,744 --> 00:08:37,544
When it comes to dating,

209
00:08:37,546 --> 00:08:39,529
wedding rings are
like kryptonite.

210
00:08:39,531 --> 00:08:44,167
If, you know,
Superman was a... vagina.

211
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:48,722
You know, I haven't
taken this off in years.

212
00:08:48,724 --> 00:08:52,342
When Bridget and I first got
together, we were pretty broke,

213
00:08:52,344 --> 00:08:54,877
so we just exchanged
these cheap bands,

214
00:08:54,879 --> 00:08:57,380
but then, after I made my first
million, I got matching ones

215
00:08:57,382 --> 00:09:00,049
made out of rhodium
and platinum.

216
00:09:00,051 --> 00:09:03,603
In retrospect, I should've had
them made out of poop and tears.

217
00:09:03,605 --> 00:09:06,573
Wait, uh... what's rhodium?

218
00:09:06,575 --> 00:09:08,325
It's the most expensive
metal in the world.

219
00:09:08,327 --> 00:09:10,277
To symbolize how precious
our love was.

220
00:09:10,279 --> 00:09:12,362
Well, that's... very romantic.

221
00:09:12,364 --> 00:09:15,198
But again, it's Lex Luthor
for lady parts.

222
00:09:16,033 --> 00:09:18,251
Boy...

223
00:09:18,253 --> 00:09:19,703
This is gonna be tough.

224
00:09:21,339 --> 00:09:23,757
Wearing it makes me feel...

225
00:09:23,759 --> 00:09:25,926
secure.

226
00:09:25,928 --> 00:09:29,412
Be that as it may,
you have a choice to make.

227
00:09:29,414 --> 00:09:32,248
Either the past,
or the future.

228
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:35,435
The memory of Bridget,
or the promise of...

229
00:09:35,437 --> 00:09:38,438
supermarket strange.

230
00:09:41,726 --> 00:09:44,110
- Here.
- Why are you giving it to me?

231
00:09:44,112 --> 00:09:45,145
Because you're right.

232
00:09:45,147 --> 00:09:46,929
I've got to
move on with my life.

233
00:09:46,931 --> 00:09:49,399
And this ring is just an anchor
chaining me to the past.

234
00:09:49,401 --> 00:09:50,483
Thanks, Al.

235
00:09:50,485 --> 00:09:53,153
Well, you are very welcome.
Enjoy your date!

236
00:09:53,155 --> 00:09:55,205
Will do. See you.

237
00:09:55,207 --> 00:09:57,106
(Alan chuckles)

238
00:09:57,108 --> 00:09:58,992
My precious!

♪ Men. ♪

240
00:10:07,214 --> 00:10:09,021
So the young man you were
with at the supermarket

241
00:10:09,022 --> 00:10:10,021
is no relation to you?

242
00:10:10,023 --> 00:10:11,907
Oh, no, Jake...
Mm.

243
00:10:11,909 --> 00:10:13,959
is Alan's son.

244
00:10:13,961 --> 00:10:16,295
And Alan is...?

245
00:10:16,297 --> 00:10:18,997
Uh, it's complicated.

246
00:10:19,832 --> 00:10:22,084
I'm fairly bright, try me.

247
00:10:22,086 --> 00:10:24,536
Okay.

248
00:10:24,538 --> 00:10:27,539
Um, when I tried to kill
myself in the ocean,

249
00:10:27,541 --> 00:10:30,175
Alan's house was
the closest one with a phone.

250
00:10:32,044 --> 00:10:33,312
I see.

251
00:10:33,314 --> 00:10:35,948
- You don't, do you?
- Not at all.

252
00:10:35,950 --> 00:10:38,767
- Okay, let me back up.
- Please do.

253
00:10:38,769 --> 00:10:42,104
Okay, when I was in high school,
I met this girl named Bridget.

254
00:10:42,106 --> 00:10:44,856
Is it really necessary to
back up quite that far?

255
00:10:44,858 --> 00:10:47,892
You're right, I'll skip ahead.

256
00:10:47,894 --> 00:10:50,912
Let's see... I got married
right after high school,

257
00:10:50,914 --> 00:10:52,230
happy, happy, happy.

258
00:10:52,232 --> 00:10:54,232
Made like a billion dollars,
rich, rich, rich.

259
00:10:54,234 --> 00:10:56,201
She decided she didn't
want to be married anymore,

260
00:10:56,203 --> 00:10:57,235
sad, sad, sad.

261
00:10:57,237 --> 00:10:58,670
In the ocean,
out of the ocean,

262
00:10:58,672 --> 00:11:02,007
bought Alan's house, got rid
of the furniture, kept Alan,

263
00:11:02,009 --> 00:11:05,627
got hungry, went to the
supermarket, met you. The end.

264
00:11:06,963 --> 00:11:08,714
Wow.

265
00:11:08,716 --> 00:11:10,299
Enough about me.
Let's talk about you.

266
00:11:10,301 --> 00:11:12,801
No, no, I have a few
follow-up questions.

267
00:11:12,803 --> 00:11:13,885
The furniture?

268
00:11:13,887 --> 00:11:15,354
The suicide.

269
00:11:15,356 --> 00:11:18,557
Oh, it was just a cry
for attention.

270
00:11:18,559 --> 00:11:20,392
I wanted Bridget
to feel sorry for me.

271
00:11:20,394 --> 00:11:22,811
Well, that's rather pathetic.

272
00:11:22,813 --> 00:11:25,030
In hindsight, yeah.

273
00:11:25,732 --> 00:11:27,265
And the billion dollars?

274
00:11:27,267 --> 00:11:29,985
I sold a couple companies
to Microsoft.

275
00:11:29,987 --> 00:11:31,153
Big mistake.

276
00:11:31,155 --> 00:11:32,571
Oh, you regret it?

277
00:11:32,573 --> 00:11:34,873
No, they do.

278
00:11:36,609 --> 00:11:38,460
How long's it been
since your wife left?

279
00:11:38,462 --> 00:11:42,581
Four months, three weeks,
four days, six hours and change.

280
00:11:43,633 --> 00:11:46,051
Let's just call it six hours.

281
00:11:46,053 --> 00:11:48,887
You're still in love
with her, aren't you?

282
00:11:51,541 --> 00:11:53,091
You really are bright.

283
00:11:54,143 --> 00:11:55,861
I thought it was
just your accent.

284
00:11:55,863 --> 00:11:57,312
It kind of raises
the question,

285
00:11:57,314 --> 00:11:59,398
"Why on Earth did
you ask me out"

286
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:00,732
Jake told me to.

287
00:12:00,734 --> 00:12:02,851
Alan's son.

288
00:12:02,853 --> 00:12:07,189
Yeah, and also wanted to because
I'm moving on with my life.

289
00:12:07,191 --> 00:12:08,490
See? Look, no wedding ring.

290
00:12:08,492 --> 00:12:10,659
Mmm, I noticed the
bright white tan line.

291
00:12:10,661 --> 00:12:13,078
Yeah, it's almost like
I still got it on.

292
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:14,763
It is.

293
00:12:14,765 --> 00:12:16,698
No worries. I gave it to Alan.

294
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:19,701
The man you kept
instead of furniture.

295
00:12:19,703 --> 00:12:22,120
Well, it wasn't an either/or.

296
00:12:23,706 --> 00:12:25,040
What about you?
What's your deal?

297
00:12:25,042 --> 00:12:27,426
My deal.

298
00:12:27,428 --> 00:12:29,010
All right, I'm a lawyer.

299
00:12:29,012 --> 00:12:30,712
Ugh! Ech!

300
00:12:32,832 --> 00:12:33,965
What else?

301
00:12:33,967 --> 00:12:36,635
Well, I'm divorced and I have

302
00:12:36,637 --> 00:12:38,687
a five-year-old daughter, Ava.

303
00:12:38,689 --> 00:12:40,138
I always wanted to have kids,

304
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:42,340
but Bridget insisted
that we already had one.

305
00:12:42,342 --> 00:12:43,725
I don't follow.

306
00:12:43,727 --> 00:12:44,893
Me.

307
00:12:44,895 --> 00:12:47,512
Oh, sure, I can see that.
(chuckles)

308
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:52,033
What do you think?

309
00:12:52,035 --> 00:12:54,369
Are we gonna fall in love
and stuff?

310
00:12:56,122 --> 00:12:57,372
What?

311
00:12:57,374 --> 00:13:00,292
'Cause that would really teach
Bridget a lesson.

312
00:13:04,013 --> 00:13:05,130
Hi, again.

313
00:13:05,132 --> 00:13:08,083
Oy gevalt.

314
00:13:08,085 --> 00:13:10,719
I, uh, brought something
else for you.

315
00:13:10,721 --> 00:13:14,389
My sphincter's tight
with anticipation.

316
00:13:14,391 --> 00:13:17,175

318
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:24,215
Oh...

319
00:13:24,217 --> 00:13:25,984
very valuable.

320
00:13:25,986 --> 00:13:27,602
Did you steal it?

321
00:13:27,604 --> 00:13:29,004
What?

322
00:13:29,006 --> 00:13:33,859
I'm only asking because it
affects my marketing strategy.

323
00:13:33,861 --> 00:13:35,660
No, it was a gift.

324
00:13:35,662 --> 00:13:36,828
A gift.

325
00:13:36,830 --> 00:13:37,612
Mmm-hmm.

326
00:13:37,614 --> 00:13:40,565
Heh. Good enough for me.

327
00:13:40,567 --> 00:13:43,084
What are you
looking to get for it?

328
00:13:43,086 --> 00:13:44,569

00:14:51,854 --> 00:14:54,439
I'm starting
to get a bad feeling.

356
00:14:54,441 --> 00:14:57,742
Oh, I'm sorry.

357
00:14:57,744 --> 00:14:59,644
You seem
like a really sweet guy,

358
00:14:59,646 --> 00:15:02,647
but I think you're still kind
of married to your Bridget.

359
00:15:02,649 --> 00:15:04,416
No, no, I'm not.

360
00:15:04,418 --> 00:15:06,501
I haven't been wearing
my ring for, like,

361
00:15:06,503 --> 00:15:08,253
like, almost three hours now.

362
00:15:08,255 --> 00:15:11,489
It may be off your finger,
but it's still in your head.

363
00:15:12,491 --> 00:15:16,494
Face it, you're not
ready to be dating yet.

364
00:15:16,496 --> 00:15:18,763
Thanks again for dinner.

365
00:15:22,184 --> 00:15:25,387
(quietly):
Still married.

366
00:15:25,389 --> 00:15:27,639
That is so untrue.

367
00:15:29,825 --> 00:15:33,028
Bridget, you're not gonna
believe what just happened.

368
00:15:33,729 --> 00:15:35,830
♪ Men. ♪

369
00:15:40,352 --> 00:15:41,703
Walden?

370
00:15:53,332 --> 00:15:54,198
Walden?

371
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:56,201
Down here!

372
00:16:03,659 --> 00:16:05,427
Hey.

373
00:16:05,429 --> 00:16:07,211
Hey.

374
00:16:07,213 --> 00:16:08,212
How's your date?

375
00:16:08,214 --> 00:16:09,898
Not so good.

376
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:13,268
Oh. So much for Jake's
lucky condom, huh?

377
00:16:13,270 --> 00:16:15,887
Yeah, we never got
to condoms.

378
00:16:17,356 --> 00:16:20,224
She thinks I'm still too
hung up on Bridget.

379
00:16:20,226 --> 00:16:21,860
No kidding.

380
00:16:21,862 --> 00:16:24,329
And the worst part is
Bridget agrees with her.

381
00:16:26,165 --> 00:16:30,368
Well, I might as well put
my ring back on.

382
00:16:33,039 --> 00:16:36,374
You, uh, you, uh, want-want
your ring back?

383
00:16:36,376 --> 00:16:37,742
Yeah.

384
00:16:40,429 --> 00:16:41,763
Here.

385
00:16:41,765 --> 00:16:44,082
Thanks.

386
00:16:45,384 --> 00:16:48,553
I had a feeling sooner
or later you'd want it.

387
00:16:50,806 --> 00:16:54,309
No. You know what?
I was right the first time.

388
00:16:54,311 --> 00:16:55,810
I don't need this anymore.

389
00:16:55,812 --> 00:16:57,862
Are you sure?

390
00:16:57,864 --> 00:16:58,980
I'm positive.

391
00:17:01,784 --> 00:17:04,703
(sighs)

392
00:17:04,705 --> 00:17:06,905
I feel better already.

393
00:17:06,907 --> 00:17:09,290
(weakly):
Oh, good.

394
00:17:10,793 --> 00:17:12,494
All right, I'm gonna
go inside.

395
00:17:12,496 --> 00:17:15,113
Okay, I'm just, I'm just
gonna hang here for a while.

396
00:17:15,115 --> 00:17:16,381
Okay. Good night.

397
00:17:16,383 --> 00:17:18,249
Yeah. Night.

398
00:17:21,470 --> 00:17:24,923
My precious! My precious!
My precious!

399
00:17:27,677 --> 00:17:30,461
My precious! My precious!

400
00:17:33,349 --> 00:17:34,799
My precious!

401
00:17:45,801 --> 00:17:47,163
You saw that?

402
00:17:47,164 --> 00:17:48,330
Yeah.

403
00:17:48,332 --> 00:17:51,766
Probably wondering what it was
all about.

404
00:17:51,768 --> 00:17:53,718
Kinda.

405
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:57,305
Well... I often enjoy

406
00:17:57,307 --> 00:17:59,941
a, uh, brisk moonlight swim.

407
00:17:59,943 --> 00:18:01,493
Fully clothed?

408
00:18:01,495 --> 00:18:04,312
You leave your clothes on
the beach,

409
00:18:04,314 --> 00:18:07,866
a drifter... steals 'em.

410
00:18:07,868 --> 00:18:09,284
Alan...

411
00:18:09,286 --> 00:18:12,320
I was trying to get
your ring back.

412
00:18:12,322 --> 00:18:13,788
But I don't want it back.

413
00:18:13,790 --> 00:18:15,623
No, not-not for you.

414
00:18:15,625 --> 00:18:16,858
Um, for me.

415
00:18:18,127 --> 00:18:20,328
I was gonna pawn it.

416
00:18:20,330 --> 00:18:21,296
Why?

417
00:18:21,298 --> 00:18:24,332
What do you mean, why?
I need money.

418
00:18:24,334 --> 00:18:26,334
I can't possibly produce enough
sperm and blood

419
00:18:26,336 --> 00:18:28,636
to get out of the hole I'm in.

420
00:18:30,372 --> 00:18:32,090
In fact, I went to the pawn shop

421
00:18:32,092 --> 00:18:33,341
while you were on your date.

422
00:18:33,343 --> 00:18:34,676
But you didn't pawn it.

423
00:18:34,678 --> 00:18:37,178
I couldn't.

424
00:18:38,764 --> 00:18:40,315
Wow, you must have been
freaking out

425
00:18:40,317 --> 00:18:41,983
when I threw it
in the ocean, huh?

426
00:18:41,985 --> 00:18:45,820
The truth of that stands
dripping before you.

427
00:18:45,822 --> 00:18:47,689
Listen, if you
needed money,

428
00:18:47,691 --> 00:18:49,024
why didn't you just ask?

429
00:18:49,026 --> 00:18:51,609
You'd lend me money
if I just asked?

430
00:18:51,611 --> 00:18:53,361
No. I don't believe in
lending money.

431
00:18:53,363 --> 00:18:54,579
I just give it away.

432
00:18:54,581 --> 00:18:57,198
(voice cracks):
Give it away?

433
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:59,617
Yeah, I think it's a bad idea
to lend people money.

434
00:18:59,619 --> 00:19:00,702
They never pay you back,

435
00:19:00,704 --> 00:19:02,454
and then you just end up
resenting them.

436
00:19:02,456 --> 00:19:03,621
So how much do you need?

437
00:19:03,623 --> 00:19:07,342
Uh...

438
00:19:07,344 --> 00:19:09,077
No, no, I can't, I can't
take your money.

439
00:19:09,079 --> 00:19:11,296
What, you're too proud?

440
00:19:11,298 --> 00:19:13,431
Oh, God, no, I-I-I
haven't had any pride

441
00:19:13,433 --> 00:19:16,718
since the gym showers
in seventh grade.

442
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:19,104
No, no, if I took your money,

443
00:19:19,106 --> 00:19:20,722
that would change
our relationship,

444
00:19:20,724 --> 00:19:22,090
and I don't want that.

445
00:19:22,092 --> 00:19:25,026
I want you to think of me as
a friend and not a freeloader.

446
00:19:25,028 --> 00:19:28,229
You don't think that ship's
already sailed?

447
00:19:29,565 --> 00:19:32,317
Allow me at least
the illusion of self-respect.

448
00:19:32,319 --> 00:19:35,403
Would it help your self-respect
if I started charging you rent?

449
00:19:35,405 --> 00:19:37,939
Actually, it would.

450
00:19:37,941 --> 00:19:39,607
Consider it done.

451
00:19:39,609 --> 00:19:41,943
Great.

452
00:19:41,945 --> 00:19:44,496
Oh, I'm gonna be late
this month.

453
00:19:44,498 --> 00:19:46,114
No problem.

454
00:19:46,116 --> 00:19:47,882
Probably next month, too.

455
00:19:47,884 --> 00:19:49,184
Thanks for the heads up.

456
00:19:49,186 --> 00:19:52,220
Okay. I guess I better
go dry off.

457
00:19:52,222 --> 00:19:55,223
Hey, Alan.
Yeah?

458
00:19:58,427 --> 00:19:59,477
You're a quality guy.

459
00:19:59,479 --> 00:20:01,229
Really?

460
00:20:01,231 --> 00:20:03,898
I have a lot of people that
say they're my friend,

461
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:05,683
but you really are one.

462
00:20:05,685 --> 00:20:07,936
Well, thanks.

463
00:20:09,939 --> 00:20:15,910
Just-just out of curiosity,
if I had asked for, say,

464
00:20:15,912 --> 00:20:18,079
a hundred thousand dollars,

465
00:20:18,081 --> 00:20:21,449
would you have given it to me?

466
00:20:21,451 --> 00:20:23,451
Absolutely.

467
00:20:26,839 --> 00:20:28,156
(chuckles)

468
00:20:30,426 --> 00:20:31,509
Where you going?

469
00:20:31,511 --> 00:20:33,661
Back in the ocean.

470
00:20:36,348 --> 00:20:38,332
(phone rings)

471
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:46,858
Hello?

472
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:49,110
Oh, hey, Jake.

473
00:20:49,112 --> 00:20:52,847
No, your dad's kind of busy
right now.

474
00:20:54,233 --> 00:20:55,483
What's up?

475
00:20:55,485 --> 00:20:58,203
Oh, you used the
frequent flier miles?

476
00:20:58,205 --> 00:21:00,121
That's great.
Where are you?

477
00:21:00,123 --> 00:21:02,157
I have no idea.
