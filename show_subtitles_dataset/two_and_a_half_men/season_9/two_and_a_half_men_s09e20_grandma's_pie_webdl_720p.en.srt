00:00:01,901 --> 00:00:02,768
Previously on:

2
00:00:03,894 --> 00:00:05,060
Billy called.

3
00:00:05,062 --> 00:00:06,694
Billy Stanhope?

4
00:00:06,696 --> 00:00:08,847
Yeah, he said he has
a business proposition for you.

5
00:00:08,849 --> 00:00:11,149
How 'bout that?

6
00:00:11,151 --> 00:00:13,918
Billy Stanhope...

7
00:00:22,444 --> 00:00:23,778
What went down between you two?

8
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:26,381
Well, we built Eddie's software
company in Bridget's garage

9
00:00:26,383 --> 00:00:28,416
and then sold it
for a couple billion dollars.

10
00:00:28,418 --> 00:00:30,135
That son of a bitch.

11
00:00:30,137 --> 00:00:31,469
He didn't want to sell.

12
00:00:31,471 --> 00:00:33,254
You really think we can finally
build the electric suitcase?

13
00:00:33,256 --> 00:00:34,789
Yes, we have the technology now.

14
00:00:34,791 --> 00:00:37,559
I-I just need you to help me
write the code.

15
00:00:37,561 --> 00:00:39,761
Hey, you know, while
we're on the subject...

16
00:00:39,763 --> 00:00:41,513
What? Peeing?
No, sex.

17
00:00:41,515 --> 00:00:43,264
There's something
you should know.

18
00:00:43,266 --> 00:00:44,682
It's about your ex-wife.

19
00:00:44,684 --> 00:00:45,900
What? Bridget?

20
00:00:45,902 --> 00:00:47,135
Yeah, I'm, uh...

21
00:00:47,137 --> 00:00:49,070
kind of sleeping with her.

22
00:00:49,072 --> 00:00:50,572
What?
W-Wait, hey...

23
00:00:50,574 --> 00:00:51,773
Mom, this is Alan.

24
00:00:51,775 --> 00:00:53,474
Alan, this is
my mom, Jean.

25
00:00:53,476 --> 00:00:54,692
Hi. Nice to meet you.

26
00:00:54,694 --> 00:00:56,077
You know what?
Tell you what.

27
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:57,979
I will call my mom
and try to set up a dinner.

28
00:00:57,981 --> 00:01:00,115
Evelyn says there's a place
right down the street

29
00:01:00,117 --> 00:01:01,833
where they have
music and dancing.

30
00:01:01,835 --> 00:01:03,484
Why don't you two
fuddy-duddies run along

31
00:01:03,486 --> 00:01:05,753
and let Jean and I
have some fun.

32
00:01:05,755 --> 00:01:08,656
You think we'll find some
cute fellas to dance with?

33
00:01:08,658 --> 00:01:10,592
Oh, Jean, Jean, Jean...

34
00:01:10,594 --> 00:01:12,677
we're not going to dance.

35
00:01:12,679 --> 00:01:14,379
I adore your mother.

36
00:01:14,381 --> 00:01:16,714
That's only because
you just met her.

37
00:01:16,716 --> 00:01:17,799
I don't know.

38
00:01:17,801 --> 00:01:20,101
I think I got
to know her pretty well.

39
00:01:20,103 --> 00:01:22,587
Good morning, darling.

40
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:25,840
Hi, Peaches.

41
00:01:31,730 --> 00:01:33,982
♪ Men... ♪

42
00:01:33,984 --> 00:01:36,568
Great. I'll pick you up
at the airport.

43
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:38,286
I can't wait.

44
00:01:38,288 --> 00:01:39,904
I love you, too.

45
00:01:39,906 --> 00:01:41,406
Tell Zoey I said "hi."

46
00:01:41,408 --> 00:01:43,458
Oh, Alan says "hi."

47
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:46,044
Yes, he's still here.

48
00:01:47,563 --> 00:01:50,215
Uh-huh. I know. You're right.

49
00:01:50,217 --> 00:01:52,383
She says "hi" back.

50
00:01:53,552 --> 00:01:54,886
Okay, I'll see
you tomorrow.

51
00:01:54,888 --> 00:01:56,721
Here you go.

52
00:01:56,723 --> 00:01:58,206
Oh, thank you.

53
00:01:58,208 --> 00:01:59,974
You got to be excited about
having your girlfriend back.

54
00:01:59,976 --> 00:02:02,010
What has it been, a month?
Three weeks.

55
00:02:02,012 --> 00:02:04,846
Still, that's like
a decade in penis years.

56
00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:08,983
Yeah.

57
00:02:08,985 --> 00:02:11,236
Tell you the truth, I'm actually
a little bit worried.

58
00:02:11,238 --> 00:02:12,320
About your relationship?

59
00:02:12,322 --> 00:02:14,322
Come on. Absence makes the heart
grow fonder.

60
00:02:14,324 --> 00:02:15,990
At least for guys like you.

61
00:02:15,992 --> 00:02:18,326
For guys like me,
absence is more often enforced

62
00:02:18,328 --> 00:02:20,245
by the state of California.

63
00:02:20,247 --> 00:02:23,397
Zoey doesn't know that I started
a new software company

64
00:02:23,399 --> 00:02:24,832
with my old partner.

65
00:02:24,834 --> 00:02:26,618
Yeah, with Billy, I know.
What's the big deal?

66
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:28,786
Well, there's
a third partner...

67
00:02:28,788 --> 00:02:31,072
that Zoey's
not gonna like.

68
00:02:31,074 --> 00:02:32,957
Walden...

69
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:34,709
you made me a partner?

70
00:02:35,678 --> 00:02:38,630
All I did was bring
you two guys together,

71
00:02:38,632 --> 00:02:40,315
The third partner is Bridget.

72
00:02:40,317 --> 00:02:41,549
Your ex-wife?

73
00:02:41,551 --> 00:02:43,768
Come on, I brought
you two guys together!

74
00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:45,637
But she helped me design
the original code

75
00:02:45,639 --> 00:02:47,722
for the software;
I had to bring her in.

76
00:02:47,724 --> 00:02:49,090
Oh, right, right.

77
00:02:49,092 --> 00:02:52,193
Well, I guess that would make
a very awkward conversation

78
00:02:52,195 --> 00:02:53,361
with Zoey.

79
00:02:53,363 --> 00:02:55,096
Yeah. I think I'm just gonna try

80
00:02:55,098 --> 00:02:56,864
to slip it in
without her noticing.

81
00:02:56,866 --> 00:02:59,234
Hmm. Story of my life.

82
00:03:04,874 --> 00:03:06,457
Well, listen, just remember,

83
00:03:06,459 --> 00:03:08,910
that love will get you
through times of no money

84
00:03:08,912 --> 00:03:11,679
better than money will get you
through times of no love.

85
00:03:13,165 --> 00:03:14,415
That's good advice.

86
00:03:14,417 --> 00:03:15,449
Thank you.

87
00:03:15,451 --> 00:03:17,118
And, uh, just to be clear...

88
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,336
uh, I have zero stake

89
00:03:18,338 --> 00:03:20,471
in this potential
billion-dollar business?

90
00:03:20,473 --> 00:03:22,307
Well, actually, I
was gonna give you

91
00:03:22,309 --> 00:03:24,225
a hundred shares
of founders' stock.

92
00:03:24,227 --> 00:03:25,410
Wow.

93
00:03:25,412 --> 00:03:27,095
If this thing works,
it could be worth millions.

94
00:03:27,097 --> 00:03:29,013
Thank you.

95
00:03:29,015 --> 00:03:30,598
My problem is I still
got to figure out

96
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:31,899
how to explain this to Zoey.

97
00:03:31,901 --> 00:03:34,802
Dump the bitch. Don't let her
screw this up for us.

98
00:03:37,406 --> 00:03:39,574
Once again, thank you
for the advice.

99
00:03:39,576 --> 00:03:41,492
Well, if it makes you
feel any better,

100
00:03:41,494 --> 00:03:44,329
I've got my own little
relationship problem brewing.

101
00:03:44,331 --> 00:03:47,282
Yeah, that doesn't
make me feel better.

102
00:03:47,284 --> 00:03:49,867
My girlfriend's mom and my mom

103
00:03:49,869 --> 00:03:53,071
have become lovers.

104
00:03:54,757 --> 00:03:57,041

make me feel better.

If we just had sex in England,

117
00:04:32,128 --> 00:04:33,461
would I be lying on

Billy Stanhope.

126
00:04:56,319 --> 00:04:57,401
Walden!

127
00:04:57,403 --> 00:04:58,769
Yeah.
That's terrific!

128
00:04:58,771 --> 00:04:59,870
It's amazing and, and

129
00:04:59,872 --> 00:05:01,322
we built this
amazing product.

130
00:05:01,324 --> 00:05:03,040
It's called
the electric suitcase.

131
00:05:03,042 --> 00:05:04,208
I-It's gonna completely
revolutionize

132
00:05:04,210 --> 00:05:06,077
the global energy market.

133
00:05:06,079 --> 00:05:07,328
Whoa. Sounds big.

134
00:05:07,330 --> 00:05:09,747
No, it's bigger than big.
I mean, the three of us

135
00:05:09,749 --> 00:05:11,716
could end up splitting
billions of dollars.

136
00:05:11,718 --> 00:05:13,000
The three of you?

137
00:05:13,002 --> 00:05:14,218
What?

138
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:15,886
You just said
the three of you.

139
00:05:15,888 --> 00:05:19,223
Y-Yes, there are
in fact three of us.

140
00:05:19,225 --> 00:05:20,608
Who's the third?

141
00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:21,759
Oh, not Alan.

142
00:05:21,761 --> 00:05:24,595
No, God, no.

143
00:05:28,617 --> 00:05:30,601
So, who is it?

144
00:05:33,071 --> 00:05:34,805
It's Bridget.

145
00:05:34,807 --> 00:05:36,073
Your ex-wife?

146
00:05:36,075 --> 00:05:37,441
There's nothing I could do.

147
00:05:37,443 --> 00:05:39,610
I mean, she helped write the
original code for the software

148
00:05:39,612 --> 00:05:41,311
so she still owns
a third of it.

149
00:05:41,313 --> 00:05:43,147
So you've gone into
business with a woman

150
00:05:43,149 --> 00:05:45,166
who drove her car
into your living room

151
00:05:45,168 --> 00:05:46,584
because you chose me
over her?

152
00:05:46,586 --> 00:05:48,485
Crazy world, huh?

153
00:05:49,588 --> 00:05:51,122
On the plus side...

154
00:05:51,124 --> 00:05:53,124
s-she's sleeping with
my ex-partner. So...

155
00:05:53,126 --> 00:05:54,458
Why is that a plus side?

156
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:56,677
B-Because she's with him,

157
00:05:56,679 --> 00:05:59,663
so you don't have to worry
about me and... her.

158
00:05:59,665 --> 00:06:01,228
I wasn't worried
about you and her.

159
00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:01,950
Good.

160
00:06:01,968 --> 00:06:03,717
Until just now.

161
00:06:04,770 --> 00:06:07,337
Why didn't you tell me
about this before we had sex?

162
00:06:07,339 --> 00:06:08,939
Do you want to have sex now?

163
00:06:08,941 --> 00:06:10,524
No!
That's why!

164
00:06:10,526 --> 00:06:11,942
I'm going home.

165
00:06:11,944 --> 00:06:13,010
Oh, come on, Zoey.

166
00:06:13,012 --> 00:06:14,812
Don't make a big deal
out of this.

167
00:06:14,814 --> 00:06:17,281
If I told you I was going into
business with my ex-husband

168
00:06:17,283 --> 00:06:19,016
would you consider it
a big deal?

169
00:06:19,018 --> 00:06:19,950
No, not at all.

170
00:06:19,952 --> 00:06:21,185
You're a liar.

171
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:27,491
Life would be so much easier
if I dated dumb chicks.

172
00:06:27,493 --> 00:06:28,826
I heard that.

173
00:06:28,828 --> 00:06:31,495
It was a compliment.

174
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,801
Here you go.

175
00:06:36,803 --> 00:06:38,118
Thank you. So..

176
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:40,337
have you given any thought
as to what we're gonna do

177
00:06:40,339 --> 00:06:42,640
about our little...
mother situation?

178
00:06:42,642 --> 00:06:44,374

179
00:06:44,376 --> 00:06:47,511
Hey... what can we do?
They're grown woman.

180
00:06:47,513 --> 00:06:49,597
They've made
a lifestyle choice.

181
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:51,548
I have no problem
with the lifestyle.

182
00:06:51,550 --> 00:06:53,184
I've tried the lifestyle.

183
00:06:53,186 --> 00:06:54,318
Really? When?

184
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:56,987
Who? College? Camp?

185
00:06:56,989 --> 00:06:59,190
Shut up, Alan.

186
00:06:59,192 --> 00:07:01,408
Sorry. Go ahead.

187
00:07:01,410 --> 00:07:03,577
How am I supposed to have
a relationship with you

188
00:07:03,579 --> 00:07:06,497
when your mother is clearly
taking sexual advantage of mine?

189
00:07:06,499 --> 00:07:07,781
H-Hang on a second.

190
00:07:07,783 --> 00:07:10,167
I don't think anyone is
taking advantage of anyone.

191
00:07:10,169 --> 00:07:11,502
You don't?

192
00:07:11,504 --> 00:07:13,754
A week ago my mother was living
in a retirement community

193
00:07:13,756 --> 00:07:14,955
playing golf
with her girlfriends

194
00:07:14,957 --> 00:07:16,573
and watching reruns
of Cagney & Lacey.

195
00:07:16,575 --> 00:07:17,591
Well, I don't know.

196
00:07:17,593 --> 00:07:18,876
Golf, Cagney & Lacey...

197
00:07:18,878 --> 00:07:21,512
Sounds like she was
already halfway there.

198
00:07:23,915 --> 00:07:25,816
Shut up, Alan.

199
00:07:27,803 --> 00:07:29,720
Oh, good, you're here.

200
00:07:29,722 --> 00:07:30,804
Mom!

201
00:07:30,806 --> 00:07:32,556
What have you done
to yourself?

202
00:07:32,558 --> 00:07:34,225
Evelyn took me shopping.

203
00:07:34,227 --> 00:07:35,526
Do you like my new look?

204
00:07:35,528 --> 00:07:36,727
Isn't she gorgeous?

205
00:07:36,729 --> 00:07:38,362
Yeah, I-I guess.

206
00:07:38,364 --> 00:07:41,181
We also got matching tattoos.

207
00:07:42,651 --> 00:07:43,817
Oh, Mom, no.

208
00:07:43,819 --> 00:07:45,870
See? It's
a little heart.

209
00:07:45,872 --> 00:07:48,489
Uh, with an
"E plus J" in it.

210
00:07:48,491 --> 00:07:50,607
I don't see one
on your ankle, Mom.

211
00:07:50,609 --> 00:07:53,277
It's not on my ankle.

212
00:07:54,612 --> 00:07:56,413
Oh, glory-oski.

213
00:07:58,283 --> 00:07:59,616
Mom, you've been gone all day.

214
00:07:59,618 --> 00:08:01,969
I thought you and I were gonna
spend some time together

215
00:08:01,971 --> 00:08:03,587
before you went back
to Sunset Village.

216
00:08:03,589 --> 00:08:05,506
I know.
I'm sorry, sweetheart.

217
00:08:05,508 --> 00:08:07,091
We've been so busy.

218
00:08:07,093 --> 00:08:08,292
But don't worry.

219
00:08:08,294 --> 00:08:10,227
You're gonna be seeing
a lot more of me

220
00:08:10,229 --> 00:08:12,529
after I move in with Evy.

221
00:08:15,633 --> 00:08:17,134
What?

222
00:08:17,136 --> 00:08:18,402
I've got this huge place.

223
00:08:18,404 --> 00:08:20,304
Why shouldn't she enjoy it?

224
00:08:20,306 --> 00:08:22,990
You're talking about
your huge house, right?

225
00:08:24,359 --> 00:08:26,443
We're just gonna pick up
some things here

226
00:08:26,445 --> 00:08:28,529
and then go close up
Jean's condo.

227
00:08:28,531 --> 00:08:30,497
And then we'll start
our new life,

228
00:08:30,499 --> 00:08:32,482
right, Peaches?
That's right, Pumpkin.

229

Come on.

230
00:08:37,105 --> 00:08:40,124
This sort of makes you
brother and sister, doesn't it?

231
00:08:45,263 --> 00:08:48,749
Is it just me or is...
that idea kind of a turn-on?

232
00:08:50,101 --> 00:08:52,069

Yeah, because we have
a child together.

236
00:09:02,231 --> 00:09:04,398
Okay, well, Bridget and I
have a business together.

237
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:05,866
It's basically the same thing.

238
00:09:05,868 --> 00:09:08,702
Have you been sniffing glue?

239
00:09:08,704 --> 00:09:11,521
No! They both require
nurturing and attention.

240
00:09:11,523 --> 00:09:13,991
The only difference is your
kid's gonna cost you a fortune

241
00:09:13,993 --> 00:09:15,626
and mine is gonna
make a fortune.

00:09:19,415 --> 00:09:21,298
do one thing for me.
What?

246
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:23,384
Let's the three of us
have dinner together.

You want me to have dinner
with you and your ex-wife?

Yes.

249
00:09:27,873 --> 00:09:30,607
That way you can see that
everything is cool between us.

250
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:34,995
Come on, Zoey.
This is really important to me.

251
00:09:36,899 --> 00:09:38,816
God, I'm gonna regret this.

252
00:09:38,818 --> 00:09:40,601
One dinner.

253
00:09:40,603 --> 00:09:41,986
Thank you.

254
00:09:41,988 --> 00:09:43,153
I will see you tomorrow.

255
00:09:43,155 --> 00:09:45,939
Good-bye.

256
00:09:45,941 --> 00:09:47,858
Well done, old boy.

257
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:50,828
You dodged the crazy
girlfriend bullet.

258
00:09:50,830 --> 00:09:54,198
Walden, I'm still
outside the door.

259
00:09:56,167 --> 00:09:57,734
You didn't let me finish.

260
00:09:57,736 --> 00:09:59,336
All right, finish.

261
00:09:59,338 --> 00:10:02,423

So did you tell Zoey
about working with Bridget?

266
00:10:15,721 --> 00:10:17,254
Uh, yeah.

267
00:10:17,256 --> 00:10:18,755
How'd it go?

268
00:10:18,757 --> 00:10:19,890
Not good.

269
00:10:19,892 --> 00:10:21,892
But she did agree
to have dinner with us.

270
00:10:21,894 --> 00:10:23,193
W-Wait, you're having dinner

00:10:26,182 --> 00:10:28,449
Well, not as bad as me trying
to turn my girlfriend on

274
00:10:28,451 --> 00:10:30,767
with a little incest fantasy,
but it's right up there.

275
00:10:34,039 --> 00:10:36,206
What else was I gonna do?
Well, I...

276
00:10:36,208 --> 00:10:39,443

Fine, fine. We'll just keep
our eyes on the prize here.

278
00:10:41,714 --> 00:10:44,048
What, your hundred shares
in the company?

279
00:10:44,050 --> 00:10:45,966
I was more thinking
about your happiness,

280
00:10:45,968 --> 00:10:47,668
but sure, there's that.

281
00:10:49,254 --> 00:10:51,171
Hey, uh, this might
make you feel better.

282
00:10:51,173 --> 00:10:53,123
Uh, I'm having my own
bad idea dinner.

283
00:10:53,125 --> 00:10:54,425
What's that?

284
00:10:54,427 --> 00:10:58,395
Lyndsey, her son, my son,
and the two gay grandmas.

285
00:10:58,397 --> 00:11:01,598
Once again,
that does make me feel better.

286
00:11:02,968 --> 00:11:04,234
Hey, how about this?

287
00:11:04,236 --> 00:11:05,652
Why don't we meet back here

288
00:11:05,654 --> 00:11:07,404
after our respective dinners
and compare notes?

289
00:11:07,406 --> 00:11:09,973
Sort of like a recap at the end
of a reality show.

290
00:11:09,975 --> 00:11:12,776
Yeah. Yeah, we could, uh,
you know, have a little contest.

291
00:11:12,778 --> 00:11:14,161
See whose dinner was worse.

your concerns, and

302
00:11:53,248 --> 00:11:55,916
Bridget was very eager
to assuage them.

crack at it.

00:12:20,007 --> 00:12:22,175
No, thank you, Berta.

310
00:12:23,778 --> 00:12:27,147
All right, obviously,
this is an awkward situation.

311
00:12:27,149 --> 00:12:28,348
Walden and I were

312
00:12:28,350 --> 00:12:29,616
together for many, many years,

313
00:12:29,618 --> 00:12:32,652
and you and he have been dating
for a few months now,

314
00:12:32,654 --> 00:12:35,572
so clearly, you're insecure
about us working together.

315
00:12:35,574 --> 00:12:36,523
I am not insecure.

316
00:12:36,525 --> 00:12:37,824
Right, and there's no reason

317
00:12:37,826 --> 00:12:39,576
you should be. Yes,

318
00:12:39,578 --> 00:12:41,495
I've known this guy
since high school,

319
00:12:41,497 --> 00:12:42,913
and yes, we fell in love,

320
00:12:42,915 --> 00:12:45,549
and yes, we spent
many happy years together,

321
00:12:45,551 --> 00:12:49,753
but the reality now is,
we're simply business partners.

322
00:12:49,755 --> 00:12:51,204
Right.

323
00:12:51,206 --> 00:12:53,540
And not all those years
were happy.

324
00:12:56,561 --> 00:12:58,762
Oh, sure, there were
some great times.

325
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:00,814
Also, I want to build...

326
00:13:00,816 --> 00:13:03,683
But there were also
some bad times.

327
00:13:03,685 --> 00:13:04,985
Also some bad times.

328
00:13:04,987 --> 00:13:07,103
I mean, the point is,

329
00:13:07,105 --> 00:13:10,407
is that our relationship now
is just strictly business.

330
00:13:10,409 --> 00:13:13,009
Oh, speaking of which, we need
to upgrade the ventilation

331
00:13:13,011 --> 00:13:14,194
for the server farm.

332
00:13:14,196 --> 00:13:15,529
Oh, that's a good idea.

333
00:13:15,531 --> 00:13:17,414
Oh, also, I want to build
triple redundancy.

334
00:13:17,416 --> 00:13:19,699
Of course, but we shouldn't be
talking shop

335
00:13:19,701 --> 00:13:22,369
and leaving poor Zoey
out of the conversation.

336
00:13:22,371 --> 00:13:24,871
No, that's all right. I love
to hear about Walden's work.

337
00:13:24,873 --> 00:13:27,040
Oh, that's so sweet.

338
00:13:27,042 --> 00:13:30,126
I'm so glad
he found someone like you.

339
00:13:30,128 --> 00:13:32,512
Oh. Thank you.

340
00:13:32,514 --> 00:13:35,182
After I threw him out,
I wondered how he'd survive.

341
00:13:35,184 --> 00:13:36,416
He's so needy.

342
00:13:36,418 --> 00:13:37,801
I'm not needy.

343
00:13:37,803 --> 00:13:40,220
- Yeah, you are.
- Yes, you are.

344
00:13:41,589 --> 00:13:42,722
So what's the deal?

345
00:13:42,724 --> 00:13:44,591
Are you guys in it
for the long haul,

346
00:13:44,593 --> 00:13:46,726
or are you just gonna date
and see what happens?

347
00:13:46,728 --> 00:13:49,779
Well, we're just finding
our way for the moment.

348
00:13:49,781 --> 00:13:51,281
Oh, good.

349
00:13:51,283 --> 00:13:52,949
Mm.
Good.

350
00:13:52,951 --> 00:13:54,434
Keep it casual.

351
00:13:54,436 --> 00:13:56,736

Excuse me?

353
00:14:00,608 --> 00:14:02,709
I'm not after his money.

354
00:14:02,711 --> 00:14:04,911
Oh, no, you misunderstand.

355
00:14:04,913 --> 00:14:07,581
I... I'm sure you're not,
but unfortunately,

356
00:14:07,583 --> 00:14:09,332
there's no way to prove it.
