00:07:12,221 --> 00:07:15,189
It's delicious.

181
00:07:19,444 --> 00:07:21,362
So what's your deal?

182
00:07:21,364 --> 00:07:23,781
Huh?

183
00:07:25,701 --> 00:07:29,102
I'm 17. I don't think
I have a deal yet.

184
00:07:29,104 --> 00:07:30,287
Ah, come on.

185
00:07:30,289 --> 00:07:31,572
Everybody's got a deal.

186
00:07:31,574 --> 00:07:33,657
Your deal is you got no deal.

187
00:07:33,659 --> 00:07:35,793
Cool.

188
00:07:35,795 --> 00:07:38,212
I'm a man without a deal.

189
00:07:38,214 --> 00:07:41,548
What are you, like, a high
school senior or something?

190
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:43,834
Well, I should be,
but they got this dumb rule

191
00:07:43,836 --> 00:07:46,003
that you have to pass
every single course.

192
00:07:47,389 --> 00:07:49,973
I think five out of seven
is plenty, don't you?

193
00:07:49,975 --> 00:07:51,425
Heck yeah.

194
00:07:51,427 --> 00:07:53,977
In eighth grade,
I flunked all my courses.

195
00:07:53,979 --> 00:07:54,895
Really?

196
00:07:54,897 --> 00:07:56,013
Yeah.

197
00:07:56,015 --> 00:07:57,398
My mom had me evaluated.

198
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:58,649
Turns out, I was just bored

199
00:07:58,651 --> 00:08:00,851
'cause I was too smart
for all the classes.

200
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:04,738
Huh. Maybe that's my problem.

201
00:08:07,308 --> 00:08:09,493
I'm too freakin' smart.

202
00:08:10,695 --> 00:08:11,662
Ow!

203
00:08:11,664 --> 00:08:12,913
I'm sorry.

204
00:08:12,915 --> 00:08:15,449
I just think we need
to establish some boundaries.

205
00:08:15,451 --> 00:08:18,752

your deal.

Hang on.

209
00:08:35,187 --> 00:08:38,055
Didn't you used to have
a bicycle pump?

210
00:08:38,057 --> 00:08:41,024
Yeah, and I also
used to have my own room.

211
00:08:41,793 --> 00:08:43,510
What do you
want, Jake?

212
00:08:43,512 --> 00:08:45,679
Okay, so you know how
you're worried that 'cause I get

213
00:08:45,681 --> 00:08:47,815
bad grades in high school
that I'm not gonna be able

214
00:08:47,817 --> 00:08:50,150
to get into college and then
find a job to support myself?

215
00:08:50,152 --> 00:08:53,487
That pretty much
sums it up, yeah.

216
00:08:53,489 --> 00:08:57,624
Well, it turns out, I get
bad grades 'cause I'm too smart.

217
00:09:02,514 --> 00:09:04,030
Too smart?

218
00:09:04,032 --> 00:09:05,198
Yeah.

219
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,366
So I'm gonna forget college,

220
00:09:06,368 --> 00:09:08,635
drop out of high school
and start my own business.

221
00:09:08,637 --> 00:09:11,755
Hold on, hold on.

222
00:09:11,757 --> 00:09:13,807
You're too smart?

223
00:09:13,809 --> 00:09:15,976
Yep. Walden and me
have that in common.

224
00:09:15,978 --> 00:09:19,480
Walden and I
have that in common.

225
00:09:19,482 --> 00:09:23,567
No offense, Dad, but I don't
think you're that smart.

226
00:09:25,353 --> 00:09:28,906
So, you're saying you want
to drop out of high school?

227
00:09:28,908 --> 00:09:29,940
Why not?

228
00:09:29,942 --> 00:09:31,358
Did you know that Walden made

229
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,893
his first million
before he was 19?

230
00:09:32,895 --> 00:09:35,412
How many zeros
in a million, Jake?

231
00:09:35,414 --> 00:09:38,282
M- I-L-L-I-O-N.

232
00:09:40,001 --> 00:09:41,502
One.

233
00:09:44,255 --> 00:09:47,240
Okay, okay, Jake,
listen carefully.

234
00:09:47,242 --> 00:09:49,376
You are not
dropping out of high school.

235
00:09:49,378 --> 00:09:50,093
But...

236
00:09:50,095 --> 00:09:51,295
No, you're not a genius,

237
00:09:51,297 --> 00:09:53,130
you're not a prodigy.

238
00:09:54,157 --> 00:09:54,844
Nice.

239
00:09:54,879 --> 00:09:57,017
My own father
doesn't think I'm special.

240
00:09:57,019 --> 00:09:58,352
Oh.

241
00:09:59,722 --> 00:10:00,771
On the contrary.

242
00:10:00,773 --> 00:10:04,608
Your father thinks
you're very special.

243

You say something to my son
about quitting high school

and starting a business?

255
00:10:43,029 --> 00:10:45,297
Oh, yeah, I told him
that's what I did.

256
00:10:45,299 --> 00:10:48,333
Hey, what do you think
about a hat?

257
00:10:48,335 --> 00:10:50,001
The only reason
to wear a hat on date

258
00:10:50,003 --> 00:10:51,202
is if you're hiding a bald spot.

259
00:10:51,204 --> 00:10:52,637
Oh.

00:10:54,423 --> 00:10:56,057
For your next date.

261
00:10:58,877 --> 00:11:00,729
Thank you.

262
00:11:00,731 --> 00:11:02,880
So you really quit high school?

263
00:11:02,882 --> 00:11:04,015
Mmm, no.

264
00:11:04,017 --> 00:11:05,567
I skipped high school.

265
00:11:05,569 --> 00:11:06,818
I quit MIT.

266
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:08,820
Oh, okay. See, there's
the misunderstanding.

267
00:11:08,822 --> 00:11:12,107
Jake has a hard time
spelling MIT.

268
00:11:12,109 --> 00:11:14,826
Oh. Well, then, he really
shouldn't quit school.

269
00:11:14,828 --> 00:11:17,078
Hey, check it out.

270
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:18,663
My socks match my sneakers.

271
00:11:18,665 --> 00:11:21,232
But your sneakers
don't match each other.

272
00:11:21,234 --> 00:11:24,252
Oh...

273
00:11:25,421 --> 00:11:27,455
Bridget used to pick out
all my outfits.

274
00:11:27,457 --> 00:11:29,040
I can see why you miss her.

275
00:11:29,042 --> 00:11:31,743
Well, uh, thank you for
clearing the Jake stuff up.

276
00:11:31,745 --> 00:11:32,794
Yeah, no problem.

277
00:11:32,796 --> 00:11:34,462
Uh, and, uh, going forward,

278
00:11:34,464 --> 00:11:36,914
keep in mind that kids like him
are looking for role models,

279
00:11:36,916 --> 00:11:38,583
so you have to be careful
around them.

280
00:11:38,585 --> 00:11:40,502
Yeah, sure.
Although, truth to tell,

281
00:11:40,504 --> 00:11:43,138
unless he sees you passed out
in a pool of vomit

282
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:45,357
with a tattooed prostitute,
you're going to be

283
00:11:45,359 --> 00:11:47,442
an improvement
in the role model department.

284
00:11:47,444 --> 00:11:50,312
Hey, Alan?
Yeah?

285
00:11:50,314 --> 00:11:52,930
You got a lot of experience
with women, right?

286
00:11:58,321 --> 00:12:00,938
A lot?
I don't know.

287
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:04,659
You know, I've, uh, been
around the block a few times.

288
00:12:04,661 --> 00:12:07,796
Did a little dance,
made a little love,

289
00:12:07,798 --> 00:12:10,465
got down tonight
on several occasions.

290
00:12:12,034 --> 00:12:13,385
Um, why do you ask?

291
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:17,672
What can I do to convince
Bridget to take me back?

292
00:12:18,507 --> 00:12:19,791
Oh.

293
00:12:21,511 --> 00:12:24,763
Walden, Walden,
Walden, Walden.

294
00:12:24,765 --> 00:12:26,297
Come sit.

295
00:12:26,299 --> 00:12:28,650
Really? I got to sit?

296
00:12:38,494 --> 00:12:42,497
A woman's heart is a deep
and mysterious place,

297
00:12:42,499 --> 00:12:44,649
almost impossible
to reach.

298
00:12:44,651 --> 00:12:46,701
Much like the G-spot.

299
00:12:48,087 --> 00:12:51,823
Although at least we know
the heart, in fact, exists.

300
00:12:51,825 --> 00:12:53,375
Okay, is that it?
Can I stand up now?

301
00:12:53,377 --> 00:12:54,759
Oh, no. H-hang on.
Hang on.

302
00:12:54,761 --> 00:12:57,662
When that heart closes
itself to a man...

303
00:12:57,664 --> 00:13:00,298
and in my experience,
it inevitably does...

304
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:04,436
the only way to reopen it
is to allow time to pass.

305
00:13:04,438 --> 00:13:06,838
That way, the
woman can reflect

306
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:09,024
on how much she
misses her man.

307
00:13:09,859 --> 00:13:11,059
And that's worked
for you?

308
00:13:11,061 --> 00:13:13,344
Oh, yeah.

309
00:13:13,346 --> 00:13:16,064
There are quite a
few ladies out there

310
00:13:16,066 --> 00:13:19,451
currently reflecting on how
much they miss Alan Harper.

311
00:13:19,453 --> 00:13:21,403
Good luck.

312
00:13:23,856 --> 00:13:26,875

00:13:37,921 --> 00:13:39,254

320
00:13:39,256 --> 00:13:41,923
He's some kid without a deal.

321

00:13:57,491 --> 00:13:59,991

You know, it's not too late.

330
00:14:10,904 --> 00:14:12,253
We could still have a kid.

331
00:14:12,255 --> 00:14:13,421
We already do.

332
00:14:13,423 --> 00:14:14,756
I'm looking at him.

333
00:14:14,758 --> 00:14:17,074

Thank you.
Look, Walden,

337
00:14:24,384 --> 00:14:25,767
I agreed to have dinner with you

338
00:14:25,769 --> 00:14:27,685
because I care about you,
but I just...

339
00:14:27,687 --> 00:14:29,437
Are we going to have sex later?

340
00:14:29,439 --> 00:14:30,855
Let me finish.

341
00:14:30,857 --> 00:14:32,190
But no.

342
00:14:32,192 --> 00:14:34,091
Aw.

343
00:14:34,093 --> 00:14:36,394
The thing is,
even though I care about you,

344
00:14:36,396 --> 00:14:38,229
this marriage is over.

345
00:14:38,231 --> 00:14:39,814
I don't want to get
a divorce.

346
00:14:39,816 --> 00:14:41,866
Why do we got to get a divorce?

347
00:14:41,868 --> 00:14:42,984
Because I have grown up

348
00:14:42,986 --> 00:14:45,286
and you are still the same guy
you were at 19.

349
00:14:45,288 --> 00:14:46,321
No, that is not true.

350
00:14:46,323 --> 00:14:47,455
I got a lot more money now.

351
00:14:47,457 --> 00:14:48,706
Money isn't the point.

352
00:14:48,708 --> 00:14:50,291
I got lawyers,
I got accountants,

353
00:14:50,293 --> 00:14:52,109
I got my own
charitable foundation.

354
00:14:52,111 --> 00:14:54,546
It's not about what you have;
it's about who you are.

355
00:14:54,548 --> 00:14:55,713
Oh.

356
00:14:55,715 --> 00:14:57,966
Well, I'm pretty much
the same guy.

357
00:14:57,968 --> 00:15:00,752
What I want, what I need,
is a partner in life.

358
00:15:00,754 --> 00:15:04,305
A grown-up, mature,
responsible adult.

359
00:15:04,307 --> 00:15:05,673
What, and you don't think
that's me?

360
00:15:05,675 --> 00:15:07,124
No, I don't.

361
00:15:09,645 --> 00:15:11,128
And you don't think
I can change?

362
00:15:11,130 --> 00:15:12,430
No, I don't.
But what if I can?

363
00:15:12,432 --> 00:15:13,481
But you can't.
Can, too.

364
00:15:13,483 --> 00:15:15,016
Just eat your dinner.

365
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:18,937
Ugh.

366
00:15:18,939 --> 00:15:20,155
This blows.

367
00:15:20,157 --> 00:15:21,739
I know, but it's something

368
00:15:21,741 --> 00:15:23,992
we're both just going
to have to accept.

369
00:15:25,578 --> 00:15:27,645
How's your beach house?

370
00:15:27,647 --> 00:15:29,831
It's okay.

371
00:15:30,866 --> 00:15:32,200
But I miss you.

372
00:15:32,202 --> 00:15:34,202
I miss you, too, sometimes.

373
00:15:34,204 --> 00:15:35,170
Really?

374
00:15:35,172 --> 00:15:37,255
Walden, we were together
for 15 years.

375
00:15:37,257 --> 00:15:39,507
Those feelings
don't just go away.

376
00:15:42,846 --> 00:15:46,014
Hey, be cool.

377
00:15:47,132 --> 00:15:50,334
So, uh, you really still have
feelings for me?

378
00:15:50,336 --> 00:15:52,720
Of course I do.
Oh.

379
00:15:54,007 --> 00:15:55,473
Hey.

380
00:15:55,475 --> 00:15:58,026
Big girls don't throw food.

381
00:15:59,612 --> 00:16:01,946
Trust me, I can change.

382
00:16:01,948 --> 00:16:03,514
I really can.

383
00:16:05,619 --> 00:16:06,701
All right, that's it.
Eat lettuce!

384
00:16:06,703 --> 00:16:09,404
Walden!
What? She started it.

385
00:16:09,406 --> 00:16:10,538
Whoa! No pasta.

386
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:11,990
I call no pasta.

387
00:16:14,611 --> 00:16:16,027
Oh, it is on!

388
00:16:16,879 --> 00:16:18,129
Oh, yeah.

389
00:16:18,131 --> 00:16:19,914
And she got some...
Here it comes.

390
00:16:19,916 --> 00:16:21,249
Here it comes.
Here it comes.

391
00:16:22,335 --> 00:16:24,302
♪ Men. ♪

392
00:16:26,006 --> 00:16:27,722
Berta, can you
get the door?

393
00:16:27,724 --> 00:16:30,174
I'm off the clock, Zippy.

394
00:16:30,176 --> 00:16:32,010
What clock?
You're a live-in.

395
00:16:32,012 --> 00:16:34,312
And I'm livin'.

396
00:16:39,652 --> 00:16:42,871
You know you took
the wrong brother, right?

397
00:16:44,556 --> 00:16:45,940
Judith, what are
you doing here?

398
00:16:45,942 --> 00:16:47,529
Why did you tell Jake
he could quit school?

399
00:16:47,577 --> 00:16:48,529
I didn't.

400
00:16:48,554 --> 00:16:49,825
Well, then, where
did he get the idea?

401
00:16:49,829 --> 00:16:51,779
Walden. He told him
about how when he quit

402
00:16:51,781 --> 00:16:53,230
he made hundreds of
millions of dollars,

403
00:16:53,232 --> 00:16:55,166
and now Jake thinks
he can do it, too.

404
00:16:55,168 --> 00:16:56,751
Terrific.
And I thought your brother

405
00:16:56,753 --> 00:16:58,253
was a horrible influence.

406
00:16:58,255 --> 00:16:59,954
Don't speak ill
of the dead.

407
00:16:59,956 --> 00:17:02,540
But you're right... he was
a terrible human being.

408
00:17:02,542 --> 00:17:05,293
Hey, who's at
the... Whoops!

409
00:17:05,295 --> 00:17:08,012
You come back
here, young man!

410
00:17:09,014 --> 00:17:10,598
He's not coming back, is he?

411
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:12,433
I wouldn't.

412
00:17:13,418 --> 00:17:14,852
Hey.

413
00:17:14,854 --> 00:17:17,138
Walden, I want a word with you.

414
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:19,107
Walden, you remember
Judith. Bye.

415
00:17:21,610 --> 00:17:22,944
You're Alan's ex, right?

416
00:17:22,946 --> 00:17:24,812
Yes, and Jake's mother.

417
00:17:24,814 --> 00:17:26,397
And you and I need
to discuss how...

418
00:17:26,399 --> 00:17:27,782
I just had dinner
with my ex.

419
00:17:27,784 --> 00:17:29,100
Well, that's very
nice. Anyway...

420
00:17:29,102 --> 00:17:30,702
She's not my ex yet,
but she's going to be.

421
00:17:30,704 --> 00:17:31,953
I'm sorry.

422
00:17:31,955 --> 00:17:34,789
She hates me,
but I'm still in love with her.

423
00:17:34,791 --> 00:17:37,659
Well, I'm sure you'll find
somebody else.

424
00:17:39,078 --> 00:17:42,613
Since we were teenagers,
she's been the only one.

425
00:17:42,615 --> 00:17:44,465
You were high school
sweethearts?

426
00:17:44,467 --> 00:17:46,668
Yeah.

427
00:17:49,505 --> 00:17:51,723
That is so romantic.

428
00:17:56,345 --> 00:17:59,480
And I blew it again tonight.

429
00:17:59,482 --> 00:18:00,965
Oh. Hey, come on now.

430
00:18:00,967 --> 00:18:02,433
It... it'll be okay.

431
00:18:02,435 --> 00:18:05,153
No, it'll never be okay.

432
00:18:06,488 --> 00:18:08,489
She's my soul mate.

433
00:18:08,491 --> 00:18:11,943
Oh, you poor,
sweet man.

434
00:18:13,278 --> 00:18:16,781
Who smells like ranch dressing
and fettuccine alfredo.

435
00:18:17,666 --> 00:18:19,701
Have you ever loved
anyone like that?

436
00:18:21,036 --> 00:18:22,837
No.

437
00:18:22,839 --> 00:18:25,373
Don't, 'cause it
hurts too much.

438
00:18:25,375 --> 00:18:27,675
Oh, I wish there was
something I could do.

439
00:18:27,677 --> 00:18:29,594
Like what?

440
00:18:41,907 --> 00:18:44,058
Oh, yeah,
I'm so quitting high school.

441
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:46,310
♪ Men. ♪

442
00:18:49,722 --> 00:18:50,788
♪ Men. ♪

443
00:18:50,790 --> 00:18:52,356
For the last time, Jake,

444
00:18:52,358 --> 00:18:54,308
you're not dropping out
of high school.

445
00:18:54,310 --> 00:18:56,744
What if I can convince Mom
to let me?

446
00:18:56,746 --> 00:18:58,279
Sure.

447
00:18:58,281 --> 00:19:01,749
If your mother says it's okay,
you can have my blessing.

448
00:19:02,584 --> 00:19:04,818
Cool.

449
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:07,788
And while I'm at it,
I'll buy you a car.

450
00:19:08,668 --> 00:19:11,053
Oh, no, no, a space ship.

451
00:19:11,594 --> 00:19:13,374
Car's fine.

452
00:19:13,375 --> 00:19:14,541
Good night, Jake.

453
00:19:14,543 --> 00:19:15,809
Good night, Dad.

454
00:19:18,847 --> 00:19:21,014
That...
that was the air mattress.

455
00:19:21,016 --> 00:19:22,749
Okay.

456
00:19:27,421 --> 00:19:29,322
That was me.

457
00:19:33,011 --> 00:19:35,011
Holy moly.

458
00:19:35,013 --> 00:19:37,147
What got into
you tonight?

459
00:19:37,149 --> 00:19:40,116
You know,
besides moi.

460
00:19:41,369 --> 00:19:42,819
Shh. Don't talk.

461
00:19:42,821 --> 00:19:44,454
Okay.

462
00:19:47,846 --> 00:19:49,846
How would you feel
about growing a beard?

463
00:19:51,292 --> 00:19:52,742
Wouldn't that
scratch your face?

464
00:19:54,563 --> 00:19:55,895
Yeah.
