1
00:00:04,421 --> 00:00:05,807
Oh, damn!

2
00:00:06,102 --> 00:00:07,872
What password
did I use for this?

3
00:00:07,873 --> 00:00:09,351
Um...

4
00:00:09,352 --> 00:00:11,068
Uh, Jake.

5
00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:14,388
Nope. Um...

6
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:16,240
Jake-1.

7
00:00:18,493 --> 00:00:20,310
Jake-2.

8
00:00:23,748 --> 00:00:24,999
Alan.

9
00:00:26,952 --> 00:00:28,585
Alan-1.

10
00:00:28,587 --> 00:00:29,837
Berta!

11
00:00:29,839 --> 00:00:31,872
Ooh, maybe that's it!

12
00:00:32,958 --> 00:00:34,742
Big Scary Lady.

13
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:37,428
Where is Berta?

14
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:39,346
She went home early.
Said she wasn't feeling well.

15
00:00:39,348 --> 00:00:40,631
Anything I can do for you?

16
00:00:40,633 --> 00:00:42,349
Out of dental floss.

17
00:00:42,351 --> 00:00:44,051
Ooh. Uh, waxed?

18
00:00:44,053 --> 00:00:46,169
Unwaxed? Cinnamon?

19
00:00:46,171 --> 00:00:48,839
You carry a selection
of dental floss?

20
00:00:48,841 --> 00:00:51,325
I am a soldier in the war
against gingivitis.

21
00:00:52,193 --> 00:00:54,228
Got the gums of a 20-year-old.

22
00:00:54,230 --> 00:00:55,479
I'll take the cinnamon.

23
00:00:55,481 --> 00:00:56,313
Ooh, good choice.

24
00:00:56,315 --> 00:00:57,681
Clean teeth and fresh breath.

25
00:00:57,683 --> 00:00:58,615
Mm-hmm.

26
00:00:58,617 --> 00:00:59,650
What are you doing?

27
00:00:59,652 --> 00:01:01,235
I was trying to do
some on-line banking,

28
00:01:01,237 --> 00:01:02,369
but I forgot my password.

29
00:01:02,371 --> 00:01:04,121
I can help you with that.
Move over.

30
00:01:04,123 --> 00:01:06,790
Oh, I forgot I had a computer
genius in the house.

31
00:01:06,792 --> 00:01:08,709
Mm-hmm.

32
00:01:08,711 --> 00:01:12,997
Okay, let's put in
your e-mail address.

33
00:01:12,999 --> 00:01:16,750
And click on
"forgot password."

34
00:01:19,037 --> 00:01:20,337
Hey, there's a password hint.

35
00:01:20,339 --> 00:01:22,506
"What is my favorite state?"

36
00:01:22,508 --> 00:01:25,759
Uh, California?

37
00:01:25,761 --> 00:01:28,178
You are a hacker's nightmare.

38
00:01:29,397 --> 00:01:31,181
Not California.

39
00:01:31,183 --> 00:01:32,066
Huh.

40
00:01:32,068 --> 00:01:34,551
Gosh, um, try Hawaii.

41
00:01:36,071 --> 00:01:37,237
Nope.

42
00:01:37,239 --> 00:01:40,223
The good news is we only
have 48 states to go.

43
00:01:40,225 --> 00:01:41,942
Favorite state,
favorite state.

44
00:01:41,944 --> 00:01:43,911
What's my favorite state?

45
00:01:45,364 --> 00:01:47,164
I'm getting
a Skype call.

46
00:01:47,166 --> 00:01:49,583
It's my ex-wife.

47
00:01:49,585 --> 00:01:50,901
Hi, Walden.

48
00:01:50,903 --> 00:01:52,286
Hi, Bridget.

49
00:01:52,288 --> 00:01:53,253
Engorged!

50
00:01:53,255 --> 00:01:55,222
My favorite state is
fully engorged!

51
00:01:57,625 --> 00:01:59,259
Hello, Alan.

52
00:01:59,261 --> 00:02:00,243
Hi, Bridget.

53
00:02:00,245 --> 00:02:02,713
Um, that was
just my-my password.

54
00:02:02,715 --> 00:02:05,516
You know what?
I'll just let you guys talk.

55
00:02:05,518 --> 00:02:07,768
How do you explain him
to people?

56
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:11,405
I usually tell people that my
wife drove me to homosexuality.

57
00:02:12,941 --> 00:02:13,941
What's up?

58
00:02:13,943 --> 00:02:15,342
Billy called.

59
00:02:15,344 --> 00:02:17,444
Billy Stanhope?

60
00:02:17,446 --> 00:02:19,613
Yeah, he said he's has a
business proposition for you.

61
00:02:19,615 --> 00:02:21,615
Really?

62
00:02:21,617 --> 00:02:23,901
Why on Earth would I do
business with him

63
00:02:23,903 --> 00:02:25,369
after what he did to me?

64
00:02:25,371 --> 00:02:28,038
Hey, don't get upset with me.
I'm just the messenger.

65
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:31,041
I'm not upset. I've moved on.

66
00:02:31,043 --> 00:02:32,459
It, uh, it's behind me.

67
00:02:32,461 --> 00:02:35,662
Yeah, I recognize your
"I'm not upset" eye twitch.

68
00:02:35,664 --> 00:02:37,831
My eye is not twitching.

69
00:02:37,833 --> 00:02:41,452
You know, tell him thank you,
but no, thank you.

70
00:02:41,454 --> 00:02:42,252
Got it.

71
00:02:42,254 --> 00:02:44,454
I wish him well, but I pass.

72
00:02:44,456 --> 00:02:45,339
Fine.

73
00:02:45,341 --> 00:02:47,591
I'm flattered, but no can do.

74
00:02:47,593 --> 00:02:48,592
Understood.

75
00:02:48,594 --> 00:02:50,260
And if my eye is twitching,

76
00:02:50,262 --> 00:02:52,012
it's only because I have
conjunctivitis.

77
00:02:52,014 --> 00:02:55,299
You don't have conjunctivitis,
Walden.

78
00:02:55,301 --> 00:02:56,400
We're not married anymore,
Bridget.

79
00:02:56,402 --> 00:02:58,819
You have no idea
what kind of diseases I have.

80
00:02:59,754 --> 00:03:02,139
Good-bye.

81
00:03:04,476 --> 00:03:07,444
How about that.

82
00:03:07,446 --> 00:03:08,445
Billy Stanhope.

83
00:03:16,639 --> 00:03:18,839
Whoa!

84
00:03:23,128 --> 00:03:24,461
Everything okay?

85
00:03:24,463 --> 00:03:26,713
Yeah. Why?

86
00:03:28,133 --> 00:03:31,518
Uh... the blood-curdling scream?

87
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:33,503
Oh, yeah. Sorry.

88
00:03:33,505 --> 00:03:37,558
No, no, I often react that way
after chatting with my ex-wife.

89
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:40,360
This isn't about my ex-wife.

90
00:03:40,362 --> 00:03:42,863
It's about my ex-friend
Billy Stanhope.

91
00:03:42,865 --> 00:03:45,182
Oh, I've never
heard you mention him before.

92
00:03:45,184 --> 00:03:47,534
Have you ever heard me mention
rectal cancer?

93
00:03:47,536 --> 00:03:49,019
No.

94
00:03:49,021 --> 00:03:51,121
Same principle.

95
00:03:51,123 --> 00:03:53,023
What went down between you two?

96
00:03:54,026 --> 00:03:55,192
Well, we built

97
00:03:55,194 --> 00:03:57,027
a software company in
Bridget's garage,

98
00:03:57,029 --> 00:03:58,996
and then sold it for
a couple billion dollars.

99
00:03:58,998 --> 00:04:01,415
That son of a bitch.

100
00:04:02,467 --> 00:04:04,084
No wonder you hate him.

101
00:04:04,086 --> 00:04:05,552
I don't think you understand.

102
00:04:05,554 --> 00:04:08,755
He didn't want to sell,
so when we did, he went crazy.

103
00:04:08,757 --> 00:04:09,756
Really?

104
00:04:09,758 --> 00:04:10,757
Yeah, oh, yeah.

105
00:04:10,759 --> 00:04:11,725
Here, look, he put it on YouTube

106
00:04:11,727 --> 00:04:12,926
for the whole world to see.

107
00:04:14,312 --> 00:04:16,013
Hello, world.

108
00:04:16,015 --> 00:04:17,231
It's me, Billy Stanhope,

109
00:04:17,233 --> 00:04:23,537
and I'm here to drop another
smart bomb of truth!

110
00:04:25,023 --> 00:04:27,491
This is my ex-partner
Walden Schmidt.

111
00:04:27,493 --> 00:04:29,359
Oh, isn't he pretty?

112
00:04:29,361 --> 00:04:34,281
Hey, Walden, tell everyone
how pretty you are.

113
00:04:34,283 --> 00:04:35,949
I'm pretty!

114
00:04:37,569 --> 00:04:41,004
Yes, you are.
You are pretty.

115
00:04:41,006 --> 00:04:42,339
But that's just on
the outside.

116
00:04:42,341 --> 00:04:46,293
On the inside,
you are a soul-sucking,

117
00:04:46,295 --> 00:04:48,845
money-grubbing sellout!

118
00:04:48,847 --> 00:04:51,181
Oh, don't forget giant douche.

119
00:04:51,183 --> 00:04:53,467
I'm also a giant douche!

120
00:04:54,102 --> 00:04:55,435
Thanks, buddy.

121
00:04:55,437 --> 00:04:58,188
I'm always forgetting about your
extreme doucheyness!

122
00:04:58,190 --> 00:05:00,307
You know what
I'm gonna do, Walden?

123
00:05:00,309 --> 00:05:03,810
I... I'm gonna eat you, yeah.

124
00:05:03,812 --> 00:05:06,429
I'm gonna eat you
and chew you up,

125
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:09,900
and digest you and then
go in the bathroom

126
00:05:09,902 --> 00:05:13,904
and take a big steaming Schmidt!

127
00:05:13,906 --> 00:05:15,489
Whoa.

128
00:05:15,491 --> 00:05:17,207
You think that's bad.

129
00:05:17,209 --> 00:05:18,659
Watch this one.

130
00:05:18,661 --> 00:05:23,080
Hey, folks!
Walden Schmidt here.

131
00:05:23,082 --> 00:05:27,751
I just wanted you to see me
as I really am.

132
00:05:27,753 --> 00:05:30,504
So he's actually talking out
of his ass?

133
00:05:30,506 --> 00:05:33,090
He calls it "buttriloquism"

134
00:05:33,975 --> 00:05:35,125
That's-That's very disturbing.

135
00:05:35,127 --> 00:05:36,126
Yeah.

136
00:05:36,128 --> 00:05:37,227
That's the least disturbing

137
00:05:37,229 --> 00:05:39,796
of the ass-talking videos.

138
00:05:39,798 --> 00:05:41,898
It-It's crazy.

139
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:44,151
I made this guy, like,
a billion dollars,

140
00:05:44,153 --> 00:05:45,402
and then he turns on me.

141
00:05:45,404 --> 00:05:48,471
And then he accuses me
of being a sellout.

142
00:05:48,473 --> 00:05:49,973
Talk about ingratitude.

143
00:05:49,975 --> 00:05:51,441
If you made me rich,

144
00:05:51,443 --> 00:05:53,643
the only thing
I'd accuse you of

145
00:05:53,645 --> 00:05:57,497
is being the best... guy ever.

146
00:05:57,499 --> 00:05:58,498
Thanks.

147
00:05:58,500 --> 00:05:59,750
Seriously.
If you don't believe it,

148
00:05:59,752 --> 00:06:02,319
throw me a couple of mil
and get ready for a tongue bath.

149
00:06:02,321 --> 00:06:03,687
I doubt that will be necessary.

150
00:06:03,689 --> 00:06:05,488
I am not talking just
metaphorically.

151
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:07,507
I will lick you
from head to toe.

Oh, yeah, yeah.
I recognize you from the video.

You look good.

168
00:07:06,444 --> 00:07:10,229
Well, you know, I cut out sugar
and took up yoga,

169
00:07:10,231 --> 00:07:12,598
stopped smoking crack.

170
00:07:13,784 --> 00:07:16,769
Well, whatever it is you're
doing, it's working.

171

00:07:18,723 --> 00:07:20,156
Oh, yeah, I'm Walden's friend...

173

confidante, mentor, gatekeeper.

174
00:07:23,578 --> 00:07:26,295
Oh, yeah, Bridget told
me about you.

175
00:07:26,297 --> 00:07:27,380
Yeah, the leech.

176
00:07:27,382 --> 00:07:30,282
Alan Harper.
Pleased to meet you.

177
00:07:30,284 --> 00:07:32,969
Hey. Listen, gatekeeper,
any way I could talk

178
00:07:32,971 --> 00:07:34,837
to Walden for just
five minutes?

179
00:07:34,839 --> 00:07:37,006
Oh, I don't think so.
He's pretty peeved.

180
00:07:37,008 --> 00:07:38,391
I got this billion-dollar idea

181
00:07:38,393 --> 00:07:40,009
that can't move forward
without him.

182
00:07:40,011 --> 00:07:42,645
But, look, if he won't see me,
he won't see me, so...

183
00:07:42,647 --> 00:07:44,263
Hold up, Billy.

184
00:07:45,015 --> 00:07:46,248
Come on in. Come on in.

185
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:47,266
Uh, talk to me.

186
00:07:47,268 --> 00:07:49,785
So, uh, a billion
dollars, you say?

187
00:07:49,787 --> 00:07:52,304
At least.
Wow.

188
00:07:52,306 --> 00:07:54,940
What could possibly be worth
a billion dollars?

189
00:07:54,942 --> 00:07:55,858
It's simple, really.

190
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:57,109
I mean, are you familiar with

191
00:07:57,111 --> 00:07:59,478
Web-based aggregate upstream
power grid manipulation?

192
00:08:02,082 --> 00:08:05,017
Uh... I-I have Netflix.

193
00:08:05,019 --> 00:08:06,202
Okay, look, it's not important.

194
00:08:06,204 --> 00:08:07,319
If you could just...

195
00:08:07,321 --> 00:08:09,538
I just need to talk
to him for five minutes.

196
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:10,840
I don't think
that's gonna happen.

197
00:08:10,842 --> 00:08:11,657
All right. Here's $50.00.

198
00:08:11,659 --> 00:08:12,808
Wait right here.
Okay.

199
00:08:18,298 --> 00:08:19,932
Yeah?

200
00:08:19,934 --> 00:08:21,050
Got a second?

201
00:08:21,052 --> 00:08:22,385
Yeah, come in.

202
00:08:23,303 --> 00:08:24,770
Whatcha doin'?

203
00:08:24,772 --> 00:08:25,888
Playing a racing game.

204
00:08:25,890 --> 00:08:27,807
Ah, that's fun.

205
00:08:27,809 --> 00:08:31,227
Uh, after my divorce, I played
"World of Warcraft" for a while,

206
00:08:31,229 --> 00:08:33,011
hoping to meet girls.

207
00:08:33,013 --> 00:08:35,013
Did you meet any?

208
00:08:35,015 --> 00:08:36,565
Well, let's just say, if you're

209
00:08:36,567 --> 00:08:39,902
lonely enough and drunk enough,
everybody's a girl.

210
00:08:41,154 --> 00:08:44,323
So, listen, um, I was having

211
00:08:44,325 --> 00:08:48,360
a very interesting conversation
with your former compadre.

212
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:52,498
You let that son of a bitch
in my house?

213
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:54,199
Uh, well, yeah,
I-I was just...

214
00:08:54,201 --> 00:08:56,535
You let him
in my house?

215
00:08:56,537 --> 00:08:57,470
Well, I didn't
see any harm.

216
00:08:57,472 --> 00:08:58,504
I kinda felt sorry
for the guy.

217
00:08:58,506 --> 00:09:00,089
I thought I could
trust you, Alan!

218
00:09:00,091 --> 00:09:02,091
You can! I just got
sucked in by the words

219
00:09:02,093 --> 00:09:03,659
"billion dollar idea."

220
00:09:09,683 --> 00:09:11,150
What idea?

221
00:09:11,152 --> 00:09:12,685
Uh, something about, uh,

222
00:09:12,687 --> 00:09:17,857
upstream grid perambulation?

223
00:09:17,859 --> 00:09:19,191
What?

224
00:09:19,193 --> 00:09:23,729
Uh, in-in-incubation...
ma... ma-masturbation...

225
00:09:23,731 --> 00:09:24,747
I don't know!

226
00:09:24,749 --> 00:09:26,982
Was it Web-based aggregated

227
00:09:26,984 --> 00:09:28,334
upstream power grid
manipulation?

228
00:09:28,336 --> 00:09:29,251
Yes, that's it.

229
00:09:29,253 --> 00:09:31,937
Oh, my God...

230
00:09:31,939 --> 00:09:33,889
He figured out
The Electric Suitcase.

231
00:09:33,891 --> 00:09:35,407
Is it really worth
a billion dollars?

232
00:09:35,409 --> 00:09:36,959
Oh, yeah.

233
00:09:38,762 --> 00:09:42,398
Probably should've
held out for more than 50.

234
00:09:43,266 --> 00:09:45,083
All right,
let's hear it.

235
00:09:45,085 --> 00:09:47,303
Oh, you look good
without the beard.

236
00:09:47,305 --> 00:09:48,921
And you look good
without the crack pipe.

237
00:09:48,923 --> 00:09:50,806
Okay, just...

238
00:09:52,175 --> 00:09:53,225
You really think

239
00:09:53,227 --> 00:09:54,477
we can finally build
The Electric Suitcase?

240
00:09:54,479 --> 00:09:56,312
Yes.
We have the technology now.

241
00:09:56,314 --> 00:09:58,814
I-I just need you
to help me write the code.

242
00:10:01,318 --> 00:10:03,235
Really?

243
00:10:03,237 --> 00:10:04,537
You need my help?

244
00:10:04,539 --> 00:10:06,271
'Cause I-I thought I was
just a pretty face,

245
00:10:06,273 --> 00:10:07,706
and you were the brains
behind the operation.

246
00:10:07,708 --> 00:10:10,209
Okay, we both know that
was Class-A narcotics

247
00:10:10,211 --> 00:10:14,279
and psychotic jealousy
joining forces to...

248
00:10:14,281 --> 00:10:16,615
to tell the truth.

249
00:10:16,617 --> 00:10:19,218
Okay.

250
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:21,821
Say you're sorry and...
we'll get to work.

251
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:22,955
I'm here, isn't that enough?

252
00:10:22,957 --> 00:10:24,340
Nope. Get out.
Okay.

253
00:10:24,342 --> 00:10:25,457
Wait, what-whatever.

254
00:10:25,459 --> 00:10:27,593
Fine.

255
00:10:28,228 --> 00:10:29,812
I'm...

256
00:10:29,814 --> 00:10:30,796
Oh, wait.

257
00:10:30,798 --> 00:10:32,631
Wald, come on, man.

258
00:10:32,633 --> 00:10:34,116
Okay. Go.

259
00:10:34,985 --> 00:10:36,652
I'm sorry.

260
00:10:36,654 --> 00:10:37,937
I'm sorry to who?

261
00:10:37,939 --> 00:10:41,357
I'm sorry
to Walden Schmidt.

262
00:10:41,359 --> 00:10:42,307
For?

263
00:10:43,277 --> 00:10:44,660
For calling him names.

264
00:10:44,662 --> 00:10:46,295
And?

265
00:10:47,781 --> 00:10:51,333
Frivolously suing him
for $100 million.

266
00:10:51,335 --> 00:10:53,285
Okay.

267
00:10:53,287 --> 00:10:54,587
Now cross your eyes,
stick out your tongue,

268
00:10:54,589 --> 00:10:55,588
and dance like a monkey.

269
00:10:57,542 --> 00:10:58,841
I will rip your throat out!

270
00:10:58,843 --> 00:11:00,075
Bring it on,
Poppin' Fresh!

271
00:11:00,077 --> 00:11:01,210
I will do it!
Fellas! Fellas!

272
00:11:01,212 --> 00:11:03,179
I will do it!

273
00:11:03,181 --> 00:11:04,213
Oh, wait!

274
00:11:04,215 --> 00:11:05,181
Hey, hey, hey!

275
00:11:09,353 --> 00:11:13,022
I'm getting too old
for this crap.

276
00:11:19,934 --> 00:11:21,467
♪ Men. ♪

277
00:11:21,469 --> 00:11:23,969
Now, come on, shake hands.

278
00:11:23,971 --> 00:11:26,956
I don't wanna.

279
00:11:26,958 --> 00:11:27,973
Okay.

280
00:11:27,975 --> 00:11:30,226
Walden, you want to be
the bigger man?

281
00:11:30,228 --> 00:11:31,593
I am the bigger man.

282
00:11:31,595 --> 00:11:33,646
Oh, that's... yeah,
with the short jokes, okay.

283
00:11:33,648 --> 00:11:35,447
No, you are a short joke.

284
00:11:35,449 --> 00:11:36,532
"You are a short joke."

285
00:11:36,534 --> 00:11:37,449
Walden, that's not helping.

286
00:11:37,451 --> 00:11:38,617
Now, come on, guys,
this is silly!

287
00:11:38,619 --> 00:11:39,985
Now, you've got
a billion-dollar idea

288
00:11:39,987 --> 00:11:41,570
waiting for us.

289
00:11:41,572 --> 00:11:43,656
Us?
Us?

290
00:11:43,658 --> 00:11:44,773
Okay, you.

291
00:11:44,775 --> 00:11:46,075
Bring it in.

292
00:11:50,914 --> 00:11:52,665
See, see?
Was that so hard?

293
00:11:52,667 --> 00:11:54,266
Guess not.

294
00:11:55,418 --> 00:11:57,136
Remember the fight we had

295
00:11:57,138 --> 00:12:00,055
over what to name
our first piece of software?

296
00:12:00,057 --> 00:12:01,290
Yeah.

297
00:12:01,292 --> 00:12:03,959
You wanted to call it
MusicAlgorithm.com.

298
00:12:03,961 --> 00:12:05,978
Yeah, because
that's what it was.

299
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:07,296
What it was was boring.

300
00:12:07,298 --> 00:12:09,515
Yeah, it was a lot better
than SongSnatch.

301
00:12:09,517 --> 00:12:10,516
Whoa, hey!

302
00:12:10,518 --> 00:12:12,484
SongSnatch is catchy.

303
00:12:12,486 --> 00:12:13,802
Oh, yeah, so is herpes!

304
00:12:13,804 --> 00:12:15,988
Why didn't we call it
Herpes.com?

305
00:12:15,990 --> 00:12:17,473
Because it was taken!

306
00:12:17,475 --> 00:12:19,608
Guys, guys,
let's-let's bring it back, okay?

307
00:12:19,610 --> 00:12:22,111
Easy does it, guys.

308
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,163
Right.

309
00:12:24,165 --> 00:12:25,114
Sorry.

310
00:12:25,116 --> 00:12:26,865
So what did you
end up calling it?

311
00:12:26,867 --> 00:12:28,701
Blungogo.

312
00:12:28,703 --> 00:12:29,918
How'd you come up with that?

313
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,203
It was the sound
that Billy was making

314
00:12:31,205 --> 00:12:32,705
when I was trying
to choke him to death.

315
00:12:32,707 --> 00:12:36,491
Blungogo!

316
00:12:36,493 --> 00:12:39,661
I heard that,
I knew that was the name.

317
00:12:39,663 --> 00:12:41,213
Yeah. Way to go, partner.

318
00:12:41,215 --> 00:12:42,998
Hey, if you hadn't been
trying to kill me,

319
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,800
it never would've
come out of my mouth.

320
00:12:46,303 --> 00:12:48,354
You really think
we can build this thing?

321
00:12:48,356 --> 00:12:50,673
If anybody can do it, it's us.

322
00:12:50,675 --> 00:12:52,474
All right, where would we start?

323
00:12:52,476 --> 00:12:53,976
Well, first thing, we'd go over

324
00:12:53,978 --> 00:12:55,677
the original design
for the code,

325
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:58,063
split it up into little chunks
that can be handled

326
00:12:58,065 --> 00:12:59,698
by multiple parallel processors.

327
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:00,783
Sounds good.

328
00:13:00,785 --> 00:13:02,067
Yeah, that's what
I would do, yeah.

329
00:13:02,069 --> 00:13:03,952
Mm-hmm.

330
00:13:03,954 --> 00:13:05,371
Then we can start
compiling the modules,

331
00:13:05,373 --> 00:13:07,773
testing them, see if we can
get them to talk to each other.

332
00:13:07,775 --> 00:13:08,741
Yeah, exactly.

333
00:13:08,743 --> 00:13:10,326
No brainer.

334
00:13:10,328 --> 00:13:13,078
Maybe the way to start is
I'll set up the testing sandbox,

335
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:14,630
and you set up the I/O module,

336
00:13:14,632 --> 00:13:16,198
and then we'll just
go from there.

337
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,166
Good.

338
00:13:17,168 --> 00:13:18,250
What do I do?

339
00:13:18,252 --> 00:13:19,585
What can you do?

340
00:13:19,587 --> 00:13:21,420
Uh...

341
00:13:21,422 --> 00:13:22,537
I-I can make cookies.

342
00:13:22,539 --> 00:13:23,889
You like cookies?

343
00:13:25,525 --> 00:13:28,010
Anyway, it's a multi-
billion-dollar idea

344
00:13:28,012 --> 00:13:29,395
that doesn't
have a prayer

345
00:13:29,397 --> 00:13:31,046
unless I get these
two guys together.

346
00:13:31,048 --> 00:13:32,398
And how do they thank me?

347
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:34,483
They eat my cookies
and send me to 7-Eleven

348
00:13:34,485 --> 00:13:35,768
for Red Bull and Hot Pockets.

349
00:13:35,770 --> 00:13:37,219
Aw.
I got to tell you,

350
00:13:37,221 --> 00:13:38,704
my feelings are
a little bit hurt.

351
00:13:39,773 --> 00:13:41,407
I mean, I thought Walden and I

352
00:13:41,409 --> 00:13:43,776
were, like, best friends,
but it turns out,

353
00:13:43,778 --> 00:13:46,061
this Billy guy
is really his best friend.

354
00:13:46,063 --> 00:13:48,247
Well, old friends
are hard to compete with.

355
00:13:48,249 --> 00:13:51,450
Yeah.

356
00:13:51,452 --> 00:13:54,870
The sad thing is I don't really
have any old friends.

357
00:13:54,872 --> 00:13:57,239
What about the people
you went to school with?

358
00:13:57,241 --> 00:14:00,409
My social life at school
was mostly running and hiding.

359
00:14:00,411 --> 00:14:02,077
Summer camp?

360
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:03,412
Oh, I still get Christmas cards

361
00:14:03,414 --> 00:14:04,913
from this one counselor
who's in prison.

362
00:14:04,915 --> 00:14:05,747

Oh, she's on vacation.

Oh, where'd she go?

368
00:14:13,023 --> 00:14:14,857
Wouldn't say.

369
00:14:14,859 --> 00:14:17,292
It's kind of a vacation from me.

Who's Shermie?

435
00:17:37,478 --> 00:17:39,478
Just a guy I owe some money to.

436
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:40,462
So this is the money.

437
00:17:40,464 --> 00:17:42,314

Although, when I was
smoking crack,

443
00:18:03,404 --> 00:18:06,622
a lot of times peeing and sex
were the same thing.

on the subject...

00:18:11,863 --> 00:18:13,212
No, sex.

450
00:18:16,885 --> 00:18:19,034

the python.

00:18:21,889 --> 00:18:23,873
What can I tell you,
it's factory equipment.

452
00:18:23,875 --> 00:18:25,341
Right, great, no.

00:18:25,343 --> 00:18:26,475

455
00:18:27,745 --> 00:18:30,930

kinda sleeping with her.

Well, you know I always had
a thing for her.

460
00:18:38,723 --> 00:18:41,524
And when you guys broke up,
I took her out, you know,

461
00:18:41,526 --> 00:18:43,058
gave her a shoulder to cry on,

462
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:45,912
and she just kind of
worked her way down.

463
00:18:45,914 --> 00:18:48,948

about you...?

464
00:18:48,950 --> 00:18:50,499
