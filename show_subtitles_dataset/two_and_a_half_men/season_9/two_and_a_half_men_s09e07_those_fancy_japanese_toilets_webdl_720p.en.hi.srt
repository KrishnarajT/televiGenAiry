00:00:04,271 --> 00:00:07,106
I can't believe you've managed
to stay in this house.

3
00:00:07,107 --> 00:00:10,276
You're like
a human barnacle.

4
00:00:10,277 --> 00:00:11,744
Thanks, Mom.

5
00:00:11,745 --> 00:00:13,713
Oh, I wasn't putting
you down, sweetheart.

6
00:00:13,714 --> 00:00:16,249
It's good that you have a skill.

7
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:18,217
Did you come over for a reason,
or just to insult me?

8
00:00:18,218 --> 00:00:21,087
The two aren't
mutually exclusive.

9
00:00:21,088 --> 00:00:22,221
Mom.

10
00:00:22,222 --> 00:00:24,223
Charlie's bank
contacted me.

11
00:00:24,224 --> 00:00:27,293
Seems he had a secret
safe deposit box.

12
00:00:27,294 --> 00:00:30,263
I knew it! I knew he had to
have something squirreled away.

13
00:00:30,386 --> 00:00:32,655
Naturally, I went right
down there to check it out.

14
00:00:32,657 --> 00:00:34,440
So what was in it? Cash?
Diamonds? Krugerrands?

15
00:00:34,442 --> 00:00:36,408
Want to wipe your mouth?
You're drooling a little.

16
00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:37,827
Sorry.

17
00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:40,362
Actually, I was quite surprised
about what was in there.

18
00:00:40,364 --> 00:00:42,832
- Oh, tell me, tell me!
- I'll do better than that.

19
00:00:42,834 --> 00:00:44,366
Here.

20
00:00:44,368 --> 00:00:46,752
I'm pretty sure he
wanted you to have this.

21
00:00:48,189 --> 00:00:49,421
Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy...

22
00:00:49,423 --> 00:00:51,323
I knew you'd look out
for me, big bro.

23
00:00:51,325 --> 00:00:52,892
What the hell is this?

24
00:00:54,177 --> 00:00:55,427
Charlie's journal.

25
00:00:55,429 --> 00:00:56,595
Charlie kept a journal?

26
00:00:56,597 --> 00:00:59,164
Your brother was
a very complex man.

27
00:00:59,166 --> 00:01:01,433
Perhaps he needed a safe place

28
00:01:01,435 --> 00:01:04,436
to express his deepest emotions
and innermost thoughts,

29
00:01:04,438 --> 00:01:05,855
or some such nonsense.

30
00:01:07,390 --> 00:01:10,809
No. No cash, dear.
Already checked.

31
00:01:11,778 --> 00:01:13,062
Of course not.

32
00:01:13,064 --> 00:01:15,030
Why leave cash to your
impoverished brother

33
00:01:15,032 --> 00:01:18,284
when you can leave your
alcohol-muddled thoughts?

34
00:01:18,286 --> 00:01:19,985
Yay.

35
00:01:19,987 --> 00:01:22,905
"To whom it may concern,

36
00:01:22,907 --> 00:01:25,774
"if you are reading this it
means either my heart or lungs

37
00:01:25,776 --> 00:01:27,276
"finally gave out.

38
00:01:27,278 --> 00:01:29,278
"Or I rejected my new liver.

39
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:33,448
"Or my brother wouldn't
give me a piece of his.

40
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:35,467
"Or I choked on my own vomit,

41
00:01:35,469 --> 00:01:37,419
"or somebody else's.

42
00:01:37,421 --> 00:01:39,805
Or some crazy chick
pushed me in front of a bus..."

43
00:01:39,807 --> 00:01:41,623
Ooh, so close.

44
00:01:43,643 --> 00:01:47,963
Well, I hope reading it brings
you some comfort and closure.

45
00:01:47,965 --> 00:01:50,734
Are you sure that's all that
was in the safe deposit box?

46
00:01:50,735 --> 00:01:51,535
Yes.

47
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:53,178
So my brother went
out to the bank

48
00:01:53,271 --> 00:01:55,654
and rented a safe deposit box
just for this journal?

49
00:01:55,656 --> 00:01:56,805
It would appear so.

50
00:01:56,807 --> 00:01:58,290
That makes no sense.

51
00:01:58,292 --> 00:01:59,942
He intimated on many occasions

52
00:01:59,944 --> 00:02:02,328
that he had some cash
stashed away for emergencies...

53
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:05,948
you know, like getting
a hooker after an earthquake.

54
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:09,752
Sweetheart, you have to
stop living in the past.

55
00:02:09,754 --> 00:02:11,587
What's done is done.

56
00:02:11,589 --> 00:02:13,472
Start looking forward.

57
00:02:13,474 --> 00:02:15,257
Yeah, I guess you're right.

58
00:02:15,259 --> 00:02:16,458
Is that a new watch?

59
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:18,344
No.

60
00:02:18,346 --> 00:02:21,063
You have your whole
life ahead of you,

61
00:02:21,065 --> 00:02:25,067
and the fact is, you and I are
all that's left of this family.

62
00:02:25,069 --> 00:02:26,986
Well...

63
00:02:26,988 --> 00:02:28,771
you, me and Jake.

64
00:02:28,773 --> 00:02:30,789
Hey, Grandma.

65
00:02:32,026 --> 00:02:35,244
Whoa. Thought that was
coming out the other end.

66
00:02:37,697 --> 00:02:40,816
You're right.
It's just you and me.

67
00:02:40,818 --> 00:02:42,317
That looks like a man's Cartier.

68
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:43,652
It's a knock-off.

69
00:02:44,788 --> 00:02:47,006
My point is,
with Charlie gone,

70
00:02:47,008 --> 00:02:49,792
you and I have to learn
how to help and support

71
00:02:49,794 --> 00:02:51,877
one another no matter what.

72
00:02:53,129 --> 00:02:55,848
Gee, that would be great.

73
00:02:55,850 --> 00:02:58,517
You were always
the good son.

74
00:02:59,636 --> 00:03:02,021
Now you're my only son.

75
00:03:03,223 --> 00:03:04,673
Oh, Mommy.

76
00:03:05,442 --> 00:03:07,643
Oh, Walden!
How nice to see you!

77
00:03:11,698 --> 00:03:14,066

== sync, corrected by elderman ==

88
00:03:46,224 --> 00:03:48,675
I must tell you, Walden,
it's so nice to finally

89
00:03:48,677 --> 00:03:49,860
see someone in this house

90
00:03:49,862 --> 00:03:52,813
who surfs for something
other than porn.

91
00:03:52,815 --> 00:03:55,282
Yeah, I love the ocean.

92
00:03:55,284 --> 00:03:57,601
Just you alone with
your thoughts.

93
00:03:57,603 --> 00:04:01,221
Time standing still, at peace
with the entire universe.

94
00:04:01,223 --> 00:04:04,057
Plus, you can pee in it
and nobody knows.

95
00:04:04,059 --> 00:04:05,725
Charming.

96
00:04:05,727 --> 00:04:07,861
Actually, I'm glad
you stopped by.

97
00:04:07,863 --> 00:04:10,730
Um... Do you know a good
interior designer?

98
00:04:10,732 --> 00:04:14,585
As a matter of fact,
I know a great one.

99
00:04:17,238 --> 00:04:19,906
Evelyn Harper Interior Design.

100
00:04:19,908 --> 00:04:21,592
I thought you were
a real estate agent.

101
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:24,044
I am. I'm also
a building inspector,

102
00:04:24,046 --> 00:04:27,181
mortgage broker, notary
public and a bail bondsman.

103
00:04:27,849 --> 00:04:29,216
A bail bondsman?

104
00:04:29,218 --> 00:04:32,519
Admittedly, that business has
slowed down since my son died.

105
00:04:32,521 --> 00:04:35,139
But getting back to your needs,

106
00:04:35,141 --> 00:04:38,108
what did you have in mind
in terms of redecorating?

107
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:39,593
I don't know.

108
00:04:39,595 --> 00:04:42,479
I just, I just want my home
to reflect who I am.

109
00:04:42,481 --> 00:04:44,931
And who are you?

110
00:04:44,933 --> 00:04:48,935
I've got a buttload of money,
but I'm a pretty simple guy.

111
00:04:48,937 --> 00:04:52,706
I... like people, but
I don't entertain a lot.

112
00:04:52,708 --> 00:04:56,326
Oh, I'm not a neat freak,
but I don't like clutter.

113
00:04:56,328 --> 00:04:58,778
Oh, you know, and the most
important thing is,

114
00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:00,947
I want the house to use
green renewable energy,

115
00:05:00,949 --> 00:05:02,716
you know, like solar
power and wind power...

116
00:05:02,718 --> 00:05:04,918
Unless Brookstone or
somebody comes out with

117
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:06,887
a home nuclear reactor,
because, I mean, come on,

118
00:05:06,889 --> 00:05:08,121
who wouldn't want one of those?

119
00:05:08,123 --> 00:05:11,925
"A buttload of money"

120
00:05:13,895 --> 00:05:15,312
You're in good hands.

121
00:05:19,434 --> 00:05:21,652
This journal is unbelievable.

122
00:05:21,654 --> 00:05:23,487
You aren't thinking of
publishing it, are you?

123
00:05:23,489 --> 00:05:25,739
What? Of course not, why?

124
00:05:25,741 --> 00:05:29,193
Well, I'm shoppin' around
my own Charlie memoir.

125
00:05:29,195 --> 00:05:32,479
It's called Man Whore.

126
00:05:32,481 --> 00:05:34,865
It's catchy.

127
00:05:34,867 --> 00:05:37,000
But there was more to
Charlie than we thought.

128
00:05:37,002 --> 00:05:38,168
I mean, listen to this.

129
00:05:38,170 --> 00:05:41,622
"I just sent a girl home
who told me she loved me

130
00:05:41,624 --> 00:05:43,540
"and I can't even
remember her name.

131
00:05:43,542 --> 00:05:45,459
"What is wrong with me
that I just have

132
00:05:45,461 --> 00:05:47,377
"anonymous drunken encounters
night after night?

133
00:05:47,379 --> 00:05:49,129
"Do I drink to fill
the loneliness,

134
00:05:49,131 --> 00:05:52,799
or to hide from the
horror I've become?"

135
00:05:52,801 --> 00:05:55,602
You know, I feel awful that
I lived with him for so long

136
00:05:55,604 --> 00:05:57,104
and I didn't recognize his pain.

137
00:05:58,606 --> 00:06:00,691
"I remember, her name is Rachel!

138
00:06:00,693 --> 00:06:02,893
"I feel better now.

139
00:06:05,163 --> 00:06:08,565
I'll reward myself with some
cocaine and an Asian hooker."

140
00:06:11,452 --> 00:06:14,204
So remember, the key to
balancing the equation

141
00:06:14,206 --> 00:06:16,240
is to place coefficients
in front of each reactant

142
00:06:16,242 --> 00:06:18,575
and product so that
all the atoms balance.

143
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:22,796
I bet you shower every day.

144
00:06:24,532 --> 00:06:26,032
Jake, we're supposed
to be studying

145
00:06:26,034 --> 00:06:27,134
for the chemistry mid-term.

146
00:06:27,136 --> 00:06:29,303
I'd rather study our chemistry.

147
00:06:29,305 --> 00:06:31,221
Lame.

148
00:06:31,223 --> 00:06:34,258
Really? I thought it
was a "double intendo."

149
00:06:35,677 --> 00:06:37,227
Hey, guys.

150
00:06:37,229 --> 00:06:39,012
Whatcha studying?

151
00:06:39,014 --> 00:06:40,597
Chemistry.

152
00:06:40,599 --> 00:06:42,382
Cool.

153
00:06:42,384 --> 00:06:45,018
Looks like you two
have a little chemistry.

154
00:06:46,238 --> 00:06:47,938
That's so clever.

155
00:06:50,742 --> 00:06:52,242
I'm Megan.

156
00:06:52,244 --> 00:06:54,611
Oh, hi, Megan. It's nice
to meet you. I'm Walden.

157
00:06:54,613 --> 00:06:56,913
Oh, are you the Walden
that bought the house?

158
00:06:56,915 --> 00:06:59,366
Yeah, how many Waldens
have you met lately?

159
00:06:59,368 --> 00:07:01,901
That's... that's so funny.

160
00:07:01,903 --> 00:07:04,588
And I'm lame.

161
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:06,906
Well, it was nice to meet you.

162
00:07:06,908 --> 00:07:10,076
I'll let you guys get
back to your "chemistry."

163
00:07:10,078 --> 00:07:12,629
Bye, Walden!
It was nice meeting you too.

164
00:07:14,248 --> 00:07:18,352
You know, if he hooks up
with you, he goes to jail.

165
00:07:19,387 --> 00:07:21,438
I'd wait for him.

166
00:07:26,811 --> 00:07:31,148
"Peed blood again this morning.

167
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:33,767
Should I be worried?"

168
00:07:34,268 --> 00:07:36,436
As it turns out, no.

169
00:07:42,493 --> 00:07:46,213
We have to get
rid of Walden.

170
00:07:46,215 --> 00:07:49,115
- We do?
- Oh yeah, he's gotta go.

171
00:07:49,117 --> 00:07:51,301
Does it occur to you
that this is his house

172
00:07:51,303 --> 00:07:53,704
and if anybody goes,
it's gonna be us?

173
00:07:53,706 --> 00:07:56,323
Actually, no.

174
00:07:56,325 --> 00:07:57,891
What's the problem?

175
00:07:57,893 --> 00:07:59,760
He's stealing my girlfriend.

176
00:07:59,762 --> 00:08:01,461
Wait, I thought
she was your tutor.

177
00:08:01,463 --> 00:08:03,764
Think about it, Dad.
Would I have asked for a tutor

178
00:08:03,766 --> 00:08:06,800
if I didn't have a... what do
you call it, interior motive?

179
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:14,991
Go on.

180
00:08:14,993 --> 00:08:17,694
She's only interested in
glomming onto Walden.

181
00:08:17,696 --> 00:08:19,312
Well, if it makes
you feel any better,

182
00:08:19,314 --> 00:08:21,832
I think my own mother likes
him more than she likes me.

183
00:08:21,834 --> 00:08:24,034
Why would that
make me feel better?

184
00:08:25,870 --> 00:08:28,405
I honestly don't know.

185
00:08:30,409 --> 00:08:32,693
Is this what I have to
look forward to in life?

186
00:08:32,695 --> 00:08:34,561
Always losing girls to
smarter, better-looking men?

187
00:08:34,563 --> 00:08:36,096
Well, think of it this way:

188
00:08:36,098 --> 00:08:38,281
you're carrying on a
proud family tradition.

189
00:08:42,603 --> 00:08:43,920
Hello, dear.

190
00:08:43,922 --> 00:08:45,272
What's all this?

191
00:08:45,274 --> 00:08:46,273
Oh, didn't you know?

192
00:08:46,275 --> 00:08:49,226
I'm helping young
Thor redecorate.

193
00:08:49,228 --> 00:08:51,561
I hope that's
all you're doing.

194
00:08:51,563 --> 00:08:53,230
Whatever do you mean?

195
00:08:53,232 --> 00:08:55,181
He's tall, he's handsome,
he's vulnerable,

196
00:08:55,183 --> 00:08:57,067
and you're old enough
to be his ancestor.

197
00:08:58,202 --> 00:09:00,186
Relax, Alan.
The only thing I want

198
00:09:00,188 --> 00:09:02,622
to pull out of that boy's
pants is his wallet.

199
00:09:02,624 --> 00:09:03,990
You sure?

200
00:09:03,992 --> 00:09:07,244
Believe me, I have
no ulterior motive.

201
00:09:07,246 --> 00:09:09,546
I believe that's
"interior," Grandma.

202
00:09:11,132 --> 00:09:15,719
You really should get that boy a
unicycle and some juggling pins.

203
00:09:15,721 --> 00:09:17,554
Evelyn, cool, you're here.
Uh, could you come on up?

204
00:09:17,556 --> 00:09:19,723
There's some things I want
you to do in my bedroom.

205
00:09:21,142 --> 00:09:24,060
Give the customer
what he wants.

206
00:09:27,248 --> 00:09:30,400
Okay, to start with,

207
00:09:30,402 --> 00:09:33,553
I want grey Carrara
marble counters,

208
00:09:33,555 --> 00:09:34,888
a steam shower...

209
00:09:34,890 --> 00:09:38,158
oh, and can we get one of
those fancy Japanese toilets

210
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,277
that sprays water and
cleans your tushie?

211
00:09:40,279 --> 00:09:41,528
With your money you could afford

212
00:09:41,530 --> 00:09:43,947
an actual Japanese
person to do it.

213
00:09:43,949 --> 00:09:46,700
See what you can find.

214
00:09:46,702 --> 00:09:49,870
Okay, in here, I would like
to replace the bed frame,

215
00:09:49,872 --> 00:09:51,838
the curtains, the dresser,

216
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,340
the end tables and the lamps.

217
00:09:53,342 --> 00:09:54,558
All right.

218
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,643
What would you like
to replace them with?

219
00:09:56,645 --> 00:09:58,395
Um...

220
00:09:58,397 --> 00:10:00,147
A cooler bed frame,

221
00:10:00,149 --> 00:10:02,182
cooler curtains, cooler dresser,

222
00:10:02,184 --> 00:10:04,935
cooler end tables
and cooler lamps.

223
00:10:04,937 --> 00:10:08,271
"Cooler." I'm on it.

224
00:10:08,273 --> 00:10:10,423
Uh, now, would you
like to repaint?

225
00:10:10,425 --> 00:10:12,192
Hey, can I have walls

226
00:10:12,194 --> 00:10:14,394
that change color
depending on my mood?

227
00:10:14,396 --> 00:10:16,429
No.

228
00:10:16,431 --> 00:10:17,764
But we could paint them white

229
00:10:17,766 --> 00:10:20,099
and get you an industrial
strength antidepressant.

230
00:10:20,101 --> 00:10:22,101
That will work too.

231
00:10:22,103 --> 00:10:23,820
Would you like to
keep the camera?

232
00:10:23,822 --> 00:10:25,755
What camera?

233
00:10:28,926 --> 00:10:30,494
Aw...

234
00:10:30,496 --> 00:10:32,111
Awesome!

235
00:10:32,113 --> 00:10:34,948
I'm on TV.

236
00:10:34,950 --> 00:10:36,216
Hello!

237
00:10:36,218 --> 00:10:39,118
I am so keeping that.

238
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,921
All right. Anything else?

239
00:10:40,923 --> 00:10:44,558
Can I have a Jacuzzi
on the balcony?

240
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,626
'Cause I'm single now,
so I'm going to be

241
00:10:46,628 --> 00:10:50,463
having sex with a lot of
women I haven't met yet.

242
00:10:50,465 --> 00:10:54,184
Oh... I just got an idea!

243
00:10:54,186 --> 00:10:59,022
Just out of curiosity, what kind
of woman are you attracted to?

244
00:10:59,024 --> 00:11:00,974
There's my wife.

245
00:11:00,976 --> 00:11:03,309
Oh, and there's women
who look like my wife.

246
00:11:03,311 --> 00:11:04,778
That's very romantic.

247
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:06,446
Oh, and Ellen DeGeneres.

248
00:11:06,448 --> 00:11:07,747
I don't know
what it is.

249
00:11:07,749 --> 00:11:09,332
Whether it's the slacks
or the way she dances...

250
00:11:09,334 --> 00:11:11,001
it's hot.

251
00:11:11,003 --> 00:11:13,253
♪ Men. ♪

252
00:11:17,401 --> 00:11:19,217
♪ Men. ♪

253
00:11:21,554 --> 00:11:22,988
You're up early.

254
00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:25,157
Charlie's journal... I
can't stop reading it.

255
00:11:25,159 --> 00:11:26,358
Listen to this.

256
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:28,360
"My brother's kid
showed up today.

257
00:11:28,362 --> 00:11:29,861
"He's kind of cute.

258
00:11:29,863 --> 00:11:31,980
"No way he's really Alan's kid.

259
00:11:33,683 --> 00:11:36,084
"And best of all,
he's smart as a whip.

260
00:11:36,086 --> 00:11:39,287
I think he's got
a very bright future."

261
00:11:39,289 --> 00:11:42,124
Oh, that just
breaks my heart.

262
00:11:42,126 --> 00:11:43,258
Yeah.

263
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:45,510
We were all so young
and naive then.

264
00:11:45,512 --> 00:11:46,678
Hey.

265
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:49,581
Hey.

266
00:11:56,105 --> 00:11:58,356
What? I took a huge dump.

267
00:12:01,761 --> 00:12:04,529
No way he's really my kid.

268
00:12:09,769 --> 00:12:11,369
You look very pretty today.

269
00:12:11,371 --> 00:12:13,638
Jake, I'm here
to study.

270
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:15,140
The test was yesterday.

271
00:12:15,142 --> 00:12:17,959
I already failed.

272
00:12:17,961 --> 00:12:19,060
Hey, guys.

273
00:12:19,062 --> 00:12:21,129
Hey, Walden.

274
00:12:21,131 --> 00:12:22,280
Here we go.

275
00:12:22,282 --> 00:12:26,384
Whoa, Megan,
you look very pretty today.

276
00:12:26,386 --> 00:12:27,619
Thanks.

277
00:12:27,621 --> 00:12:29,221
You look pretty, too.

278
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:32,290
Thank you.

279
00:12:32,292 --> 00:12:33,625
Where are you going?

280
00:12:33,627 --> 00:12:36,978
Oh, I am going furniture
shopping with Jake's grandma.

281
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:39,181
Oh, I love furniture.

282
00:12:40,316 --> 00:12:43,301
And grandmas.

283
00:12:43,303 --> 00:12:44,636
Cool.

284
00:12:46,022 --> 00:12:47,355
See ya.

285
00:12:47,357 --> 00:12:49,974
See ya.

286
00:12:49,976 --> 00:12:51,326
Okay, Megan,

287
00:12:51,328 --> 00:12:52,527
I know what's going on here

288
00:12:52,529 --> 00:12:54,613
and I really don't appreciate...

289
00:12:56,816 --> 00:12:57,916
What's that about?

290
00:12:57,918 --> 00:13:00,085
I don't know. I'm
just in the mood.

291
00:13:00,087 --> 00:13:01,286
Okay.

292
00:13:03,339 --> 00:13:04,823
Come on.

293
00:13:04,825 --> 00:13:06,341
Okay.

294
00:13:06,343 --> 00:13:07,375
Where are we going?

295
00:13:07,377 --> 00:13:08,677
To your room.

296
00:13:08,679 --> 00:13:10,879
Okay.

297
00:13:12,765 --> 00:13:16,167
Hello, gorgeous.

298
00:13:16,169 --> 00:13:18,186
Did you miss me?

299
00:13:18,188 --> 00:13:20,472
'Cause I sure missed you.

300
00:13:20,474 --> 00:13:23,725
Let me pull this thing
out of you.

301
00:13:34,972 --> 00:13:37,906
Are you gonna turn your car off?

302
00:13:40,244 --> 00:13:43,027
I did.

303
00:13:44,881 --> 00:13:46,965
Might need service.

304
00:13:46,967 --> 00:13:49,551
Sadly, that's where
I just came from.

305
00:13:53,707 --> 00:13:56,591
You know what's great
about my electric car?

306
00:13:56,593 --> 00:13:58,009
What?

307
00:13:58,979 --> 00:14:00,312
I just turned it on.

308
00:14:00,314 --> 00:14:02,080
Sweet.

309
00:14:02,082 --> 00:14:03,748
So where you headed?

310
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:05,433
Um, I'm going
to pick up your mom.

311
00:14:05,435 --> 00:14:06,768
We're going furniture shopping.

312
00:14:06,770 --> 00:14:08,720
Okay, well, just
a little heads up

313
00:14:08,722 --> 00:14:11,723
before you journey to
the caves of Mordor.

314
00:14:11,725 --> 00:14:13,491
My mother has what
you might call

315
00:14:13,493 --> 00:14:15,944
a, uh, proclivity
for younger men.

316
00:14:15,946 --> 00:14:17,228
You mean she's like a cougar?

317
00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:19,230
No, she's not
"like a cougar"

318
00:14:19,232 --> 00:14:20,615
she's the mother
of all cougars.

319
00:14:20,617 --> 00:14:23,568
So kind of an uber-cougar?

320
00:14:23,570 --> 00:14:25,787
A super duper
uber-cougar.

321
00:14:25,789 --> 00:14:27,422
You think a bit of better butter

322
00:14:27,424 --> 00:14:29,624
would make
her bitter batter better?

323
00:14:29,626 --> 00:14:31,660
What?

324
00:14:31,662 --> 00:14:33,879
I just like saying that.

325
00:14:33,881 --> 00:14:35,230
Walden, I'm
serious here.

326
00:14:35,232 --> 00:14:36,798
Don't worry.

327
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,433
I'm not going to hook up
with your mom.

328
00:14:38,435 --> 00:14:40,919
Yeah, if I had a dime for
every time I heard that,

329
00:14:40,921 --> 00:14:43,104
I'd have $3.60.

330
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:46,308
And I know that doesn't
sound like a lot,

331
00:14:46,310 --> 00:14:48,727
but it is 36 times.

332
00:14:48,729 --> 00:14:51,680
That's a very weird thing
to keep track of.

333
00:14:51,682 --> 00:14:53,615
I got a lot
of free time.

334
00:14:53,617 --> 00:14:57,068
Trust me,
nothing's going to happen.

335
00:14:57,070 --> 00:14:59,938
Okay. But try not to
hurt her feelings.

336
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:02,123
I mean, she may be a rapacious
sexual predator,

337
00:15:02,125 --> 00:15:04,492
but she breaks
just like a little girl.

338
00:15:04,494 --> 00:15:05,827
Understood.

339
00:15:05,829 --> 00:15:07,946
Oh, hey, check it out.

340
00:15:07,948 --> 00:15:10,048
I got voice control.

341
00:15:10,050 --> 00:15:11,633
Lights on.

342
00:15:13,619 --> 00:15:15,220
Radio on.

343
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:19,641
Back up.

344
00:15:22,144 --> 00:15:24,145
Bye!

345
00:15:31,103 --> 00:15:34,973
Well, you may not be
pretty or expensive,

346
00:15:34,975 --> 00:15:37,575
but you get me
where I want to go.

347
00:15:42,164 --> 00:15:44,032
Thank you for walking
me to my door.

348
00:15:44,034 --> 00:15:45,917
You don't meet many
gentlemen nowadays.

349
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:47,002
You're welcome.

350
00:15:47,004 --> 00:15:48,136
Is that a camera?

351
00:15:48,138 --> 00:15:50,088
Hello!

352
00:15:50,090 --> 00:15:53,124
Would you like to come in
for a drink before you go?

353
00:15:53,126 --> 00:15:55,877
I don't know,
I should probably get going.

354
00:15:55,879 --> 00:15:56,928
What's your hurry?

355
00:15:56,930 --> 00:15:58,546
I just think that

356
00:15:58,548 --> 00:16:00,548
we should keep
our relationship business

357
00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:03,718
and not "biznass."

358
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:07,171
Oh, my goodness,
do you think I'm hitting on you?

359
00:16:08,224 --> 00:16:11,977
W-Well, Alan did say
that you're an uber-cougar.

360
00:16:11,979 --> 00:16:14,195
An uber-cougar?

361
00:16:14,197 --> 00:16:16,698
A super duper uber-cougar.

362
00:16:19,236 --> 00:16:21,069
Oh, my Lord.

363
00:16:21,071 --> 00:16:23,288
Now, you listen to me,
young man.

364
00:16:23,290 --> 00:16:26,291
My son has some serious issues.

365
00:16:26,293 --> 00:16:28,410
And he tends to imagine things.

366
00:16:28,412 --> 00:16:33,248
Believe me, I have no carnal
designs on you whatsoever.

367
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:34,916
Really?

368
00:16:34,918 --> 00:16:38,887
For God's sake, Walden, I'm old
enough to be your mother.

369
00:16:38,889 --> 00:16:42,206
Assuming a teenage pregnancy
of course.

370
00:16:42,208 --> 00:16:44,509
Okay, sure.

371
00:16:44,511 --> 00:16:46,711
I'll have a drink.

372
00:16:59,392 --> 00:17:01,576
Are you going to tell Alan?

373
00:17:03,996 --> 00:17:07,732
I'm going to tell everyone.

374
00:17:07,734 --> 00:17:09,951
♪ Men. ♪

375
00:17:13,576 --> 00:17:15,576

376
00:17:15,602 --> 00:17:18,337
"Alan moved in with
his girlfriend yesterday.

377
00:17:18,339 --> 00:17:22,091
"How stupid is she?

378
00:17:22,093 --> 00:17:23,676
"Oh, well, doesn't matter.

379
00:17:23,678 --> 00:17:25,711
"Like a nonspecific
urinary infection,

"I'm sure he'll be back
before long.

I actually kind of miss

"the jug-eared freeloader.

383
00:17:33,971 --> 00:17:36,222
How stupid am I?"

384
00:17:38,108 --> 00:17:40,843
I don't believe it.

385
00:17:40,845 --> 00:17:43,479
He loved me.

386
00:17:43,481 --> 00:17:45,681
My brother loved me.

387
00:17:48,568 --> 00:17:49,852
"Speaking of stupid,

388
00:17:49,854 --> 00:17:52,204
"today I bought
a $100,000 Cartier watch.

389
00:17:52,206 --> 00:17:53,639
"But I'm afraid to wear it,

390
00:17:53,641 --> 00:17:55,991
so I'm gonna keep it
in my safe deposit box."

391
00:17:55,993 --> 00:17:58,661
Son of a bitch!

392
00:17:58,663 --> 00:18:01,163
That was, that was great.

393
00:18:03,533 --> 00:18:04,550
Just-Just great.

394
00:18:04,552 --> 00:18:06,802
Thank you so much.

395
00:18:11,725 --> 00:18:13,125
Hey.

396
00:18:13,127 --> 00:18:15,161
Hey. How'd it go
with my mom?

397
00:18:15,163 --> 00:18:17,713
Fine, fine.

398
00:18:17,715 --> 00:18:20,015
Just shopped for furniture.

399
00:18:21,101 --> 00:18:24,987
Rugs, chairs and tables.

400
00:18:24,989 --> 00:18:26,739
Nice.

401
00:18:26,741 --> 00:18:29,358
Armoires, ottomans,

402
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:31,327
curtains, recliners,

403
00:18:31,329 --> 00:18:33,763
love seats, throw pillows.

404
00:18:33,765 --> 00:18:35,948
Okay, good night.

405
00:18:37,784 --> 00:18:40,503
Oh, yeah, she did him.

406
00:18:40,505 --> 00:18:42,588
Bye. Thanks again!

407
00:18:42,590 --> 00:18:44,123
Hey, dude, how you doing?

408
00:18:44,125 --> 00:18:44,957
Fantastic.

409
00:18:44,959 --> 00:18:47,126
I love you, man.

410
00:18:49,846 --> 00:18:51,458
Thanks.

411
00:18:53,074 --> 00:18:54,810
What an affectionate family.
