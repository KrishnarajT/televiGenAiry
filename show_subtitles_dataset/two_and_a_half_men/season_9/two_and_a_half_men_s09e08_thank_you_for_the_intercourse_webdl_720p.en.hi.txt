No, I-I can't tell you
how many hours

67
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:46,627
I watched my brother
playing this piano

68
00:02:46,935 --> 00:02:49,269
or passed out under it.

69
00:02:50,301 --> 00:02:54,675
One time I walked in and he was
having sex on top of it.

70
00:02:54,676 --> 00:02:56,643
You can see
where the young lady's ass print

71
00:02:56,644 --> 00:02:59,507
didn't quite wax out.

00:02:59,627 --> 00:03:01,982

used a coaster.

73
00:03:06,459 --> 00:03:11,391
New business idea-
ass coasters.

74
00:03:13,028 --> 00:03:15,029
We're here to pick up a piano.

75
00:03:15,149 --> 00:03:18,933
Oh, right, I, I forgot.

76
00:03:18,934 --> 00:03:20,067
Uh...

77
00:03:21,603 --> 00:03:23,303
Hold on.

78
00:03:29,344 --> 00:03:33,380
So I imagine you're anxious

79
00:03:33,381 --> 00:03:34,982
to get rid of some of these

80
00:03:34,983 --> 00:03:36,016
painful memories.

81
00:03:36,017 --> 00:03:37,484
No, are you kidding me?

82
00:03:37,485 --> 00:03:39,120
I mean, this piano
is practically

83
00:03:39,121 --> 00:03:40,888
all I have left of my brother,

84
00:03:40,889 --> 00:03:43,323
except for, you
know, all the DNA

85
00:03:43,324 --> 00:03:45,860
he left on the couch and...

86
00:03:45,861 --> 00:03:49,196
on the floor and...

87
00:03:49,197 --> 00:03:51,632
on the walls and on the stairs,

88
00:03:51,633 --> 00:03:56,470
but I'm not going to clone him,
so the piano's pretty much it.

89
00:03:56,471 --> 00:04:00,374
Okay, we got a problem then.
How so?

90
00:04:00,375 --> 00:04:02,910
Well, you know
how I'm redecorating the house?

91
00:04:02,911 --> 00:04:06,580
I donated the piano to a music
school for underprivileged kids.

92
00:04:06,581 --> 00:04:07,581
What?

93
00:04:07,582 --> 00:04:09,650
How could you be so selfish?

94
00:04:09,651 --> 00:04:12,319
I'm sorry,
I'll just tell the kids

95
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:15,756
they have to keep practicing
on a painted slab of wood.

96
00:04:15,757 --> 00:04:17,591
No, no, you're right.

97
00:04:17,592 --> 00:04:19,026
This, this should go to someone

98
00:04:19,027 --> 00:04:20,828
who will benefit from it.

99
00:04:20,829 --> 00:04:22,096
You sure?

100
00:04:22,097 --> 00:04:25,499
Yeah, yeah, let me,
uh, let me just get

101
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:27,401
Charlie's personal stuff
out of here.

102
00:04:27,402 --> 00:04:31,738
Oh, oh, here's some of
his unfinished music.

103
00:04:31,739 --> 00:04:34,675
Uh, panties.

104
00:04:34,676 --> 00:04:39,013

105
00:04:39,014 --> 00:04:41,081

00:04:42,617 --> 00:04:43,851
Oh, vibrator.

107
00:04:43,852 --> 00:04:44,852
Oh.

108
00:04:46,454 --> 00:04:48,289
So we're talking songs,

109
00:04:48,290 --> 00:04:51,725
thongs, bongs, and schlongs.

110
00:04:51,726 --> 00:04:55,162
If he had an autobiography,
that would be the title.

111
00:04:56,865 --> 00:04:58,365
You know, there was a time

112
00:04:58,366 --> 00:05:00,334
when I would have found
these things disgusting.

113
00:05:00,335 --> 00:05:01,368
And now?

114
00:05:01,369 --> 00:05:03,204

115
00:05:03,205 --> 00:05:05,139
mixed in with my revulsion.

155
00:06:46,574 --> 00:06:48,409

Well, I know he loved you.

163
00:07:10,465 --> 00:07:12,466
Then how come
he didn't leave me anything?

164
00:07:12,467 --> 00:07:14,901
Well, you don't measure love
by things.

165
00:07:14,902 --> 00:07:16,403
I disagree.

166
00:07:17,872 --> 00:07:21,075
Nothing says "I love you"
like a Mercedes CL600.

167
00:07:21,076 --> 00:07:23,010
Hey, the Mercedes was leased.

168
00:07:23,011 --> 00:07:25,879
And is that all your uncle
meant to you- a nice car?

169
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:27,747
Of course not-
I learned a lot from him.

170
00:07:27,748 --> 00:07:29,083
Like what?

171
00:07:29,084 --> 00:07:30,417
Well, let's see.

172
00:07:30,418 --> 00:07:32,586
If it doesn't fit,
don't force it.

173
00:07:37,392 --> 00:07:39,693
It's always better
to say sorry afterwards

174
00:07:39,694 --> 00:07:41,761
than ask for permission before.

175
00:07:43,564 --> 00:07:45,332
And if it's burning,
bleeding, or oozing,

176
00:07:45,333 --> 00:07:47,401
go to see a doctor ASAP.

177
00:07:50,405 --> 00:07:52,973
Oh, God.

178
00:07:52,974 --> 00:07:54,708
But probably the most
important thing I learned

179
00:07:54,709 --> 00:07:56,377
is that by the time I'm his age,

180
