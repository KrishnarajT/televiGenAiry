21
00:00:41,577 --> 00:00:43,910

his own brother's head off.

It was kind of
hard not to.

184
00:06:48,810 --> 00:06:50,143
Well, you know how it is.

185
00:06:50,145 --> 00:06:53,447
Uh, you and I
are like the mailmen.

186
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:58,368
Rain or shine, we got to deliver
the old package.

187
00:06:58,370 --> 00:07:00,754

No, wait, let me think
of another one.

190

This side up.

191
00:07:12,251 --> 00:07:13,884
Oh.

192
00:07:13,886 --> 00:07:15,686
That's good, that's good.

193
00:07:21,526 --> 00:07:24,010
Oh, who am I kidding?

194
00:07:24,012 --> 00:07:25,779
Last night was a complete sham.

195
00:07:25,781 --> 00:07:26,980
What do you mean?

196
00:07:26,982 --> 00:07:28,815
Zoey was trying to prove

197
00:07:28,817 --> 00:07:30,450
some kind of point to Lyndsey.

198
00:07:30,452 --> 00:07:32,286
So, all that noise was, uh...?

199
00:07:32,288 --> 00:07:34,655
I had nothing to do with it.

200
00:07:34,657 --> 00:07:36,790
Sorry.

201
00:07:38,293 --> 00:07:43,463
Well, since we're being honest,
I should probably tell you...

202
00:07:43,465 --> 00:07:48,001
I... had what was probably the
best sex of my life last night.

203
00:07:53,341 --> 00:07:54,391
Good morning.

204
00:07:54,393 --> 00:07:55,375
Huh?

205
00:07:55,377 --> 00:07:57,060
Oh, morning.

206
00:07:57,062 --> 00:07:58,345
Sleep well?

207
00:07:58,347 --> 00:07:59,546
Terrific.

208
00:07:59,548 --> 00:08:02,065
Good. I was afraid
we might have kept you awake.

209
00:08:02,067 --> 00:08:03,350
Really?

210
00:08:03,352 --> 00:08:05,435
I was worried we might have
kept you awake.

211
00:08:05,437 --> 00:08:07,854
No, no, I slept like a baby.

212
00:08:07,856 --> 00:08:09,573

That's good, right?

215
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:19,182
Not that laugh.

216
00:08:19,184 --> 00:08:21,868
That's the bad laugh.

217
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:25,889
Shame it has to be raining
on Valentine's Day.

218
00:08:25,891 --> 00:08:30,076
Yeah, well, fortunately, the sun
is shining in Cabo San Lucas.

219
00:08:30,078 --> 00:08:31,545
Thanks for the weather report.

220
00:08:31,547 --> 00:08:33,630
Now here's Alan
with the sports.

221
00:08:35,433 --> 00:08:37,217
I just meant
that's where Walden and I

222
00:08:37,219 --> 00:08:38,352
are flying for dinner tonight.

223
00:08:38,354 --> 00:08:39,553

Good luck with LAX.

Place is gonna be a madhouse.

226
00:08:41,957 --> 00:08:43,256
That may well be.

227
00:08:43,258 --> 00:08:45,275
Luckily, Walden's got
his private jet, so...

228
00:08:45,277 --> 00:08:46,693
Of course he does.

229
00:08:46,695 --> 00:08:49,646
Or they could fly down
on her private broom.

230
00:08:51,416 --> 00:08:53,266
What are you and Alan
doing to celebrate?

231
00:08:53,268 --> 00:08:55,068
Oh, don't worry
about us.

232
00:08:55,070 --> 00:08:56,320
We have big plans.

233
00:08:56,322 --> 00:08:57,487
Ooh.

234
00:08:57,489 --> 00:08:59,122
Another festive foot rub?

235
00:09:03,612 --> 00:09:04,795
Bad laugh?

236
00:09:06,831 --> 00:09:08,715
As a matter of fact,
we're gonna spend the night

237
00:09:08,717 --> 00:09:09,833
at a little bed-and-breakfast

238
00:09:09,835 --> 00:09:11,802
outside Santa Barbara
where we're gonna

239
00:09:11,804 --> 00:09:13,553
drink wine, read poetry

240
00:09:13,555 --> 00:09:15,172
and have hot,
kinky sex.

241
00:09:15,174 --> 00:09:16,306
Right, Alan?

242
00:09:16,308 --> 00:09:18,175
Oh, yeah, sure.

243
00:09:18,177 --> 00:09:19,309
Uh, sure.

244
00:09:19,311 --> 00:09:21,511
The, uh, the holy trinity of
Valentine's Day:

245
00:09:21,513 --> 00:09:24,964
sips, sonnets and sodomy.

246
00:09:27,352 --> 00:09:28,485
That's interesting.

247
00:09:28,487 --> 00:09:30,821
I can see you
as a drunken sodomite,

248
00:09:30,823 --> 00:09:33,306
never imagined
you liking poetry.

249
00:09:33,308 --> 00:09:34,908
Oh, no, no, I really do.

250
00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:36,576
Here's a poem
you might appreciate.

251
00:09:36,578 --> 00:09:37,577
"Roses are red,

252
00:09:37,579 --> 00:09:38,862

253
00:09:38,864 --> 00:09:39,996

unrefined ass."

255
00:09:46,554 --> 00:09:48,988
A lady doesn't bite.

256
00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:49,956
Hmm.

257
00:09:49,958 --> 00:09:51,258
She will however be happy

258
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:53,993

as a bonnet.

372
00:15:01,125 --> 00:15:02,841

California wine.

a new place to live.

do you think might work?

is throw out my diaphragm.

actually good
