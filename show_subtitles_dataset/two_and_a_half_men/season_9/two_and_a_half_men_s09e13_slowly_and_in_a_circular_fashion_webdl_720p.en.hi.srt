00:00:03,977 --> 00:00:06,427
Hey, Alan,
meet my mother, Robin.

3
00:00:06,429 --> 00:00:08,646
- Nice to meet you, Alan.
- Likewise.

4
00:00:09,582 --> 00:00:12,283
I know what I want for
Christmas.

5
00:00:12,285 --> 00:00:14,685
- Bridget?
- I can't sign the divorce papers.

6
00:00:14,687 --> 00:00:18,022
I love you, and
I want you back.

7
00:00:18,957 --> 00:00:21,909
I want you so badly.

8
00:00:21,911 --> 00:00:24,412
I... want you, too.

9
00:00:24,414 --> 00:00:25,967
I don't think it's a good
idea to sleep with you,

10
00:00:25,968 --> 00:00:27,186
since I started seeing
someone new,

11
00:00:27,211 --> 00:00:28,778
and I think she might
be the real deal.

12
00:00:29,218 --> 00:00:31,419
Not that you weren't the
real deal; you're just

13
00:00:31,421 --> 00:00:35,556
the ex-real deal, and
she's the next real deal.

14
00:00:35,558 --> 00:00:37,708
I can't believe you waited till
I was half-naked in your bed

15
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:39,260
to tell me you were seeing
someone else.

16
00:00:39,262 --> 00:00:42,063
Kinda hard to bring up while
you're taking off my pants.

17
00:00:42,065 --> 00:00:44,214
Go to hell, you son of a bitch!

18
00:00:44,216 --> 00:00:46,067
That didn't go
as well as I'd hoped.

19
00:00:46,069 --> 00:00:46,895
I wouldn't worry about it.

About $80 million.

kind of money an "oops"?

31
00:01:22,605 --> 00:01:23,854
Yeah.

32
00:01:23,856 --> 00:01:25,923
No, no, no. "Oops" is when you
clip your toenails

33
00:01:25,925 --> 00:01:27,641
too close and they bleed.

34
00:01:28,477 --> 00:01:29,777
"Oops" is when you mistake

toothpaste for lubricant.

36
00:01:32,815 --> 00:01:35,099
"Oops" is when you thought a

was going to be silent.

38
00:01:37,269 --> 00:01:40,454
You've mistaken toothpaste for
lubricant?

39
00:01:40,456 --> 00:01:41,605
Just once.

40

Stung like hell, but my penis
was minty fresh.

41
00:01:45,877 --> 00:01:48,679

Ex-wife.

45
00:02:01,961 --> 00:02:04,845
Uh, see that's
the correct use of the "uh-oh."

47
00:02:09,519 --> 00:02:11,802

back is change the name.

118
00:05:06,006 --> 00:05:08,890
Yeah, well, be that as it may,
the fact remains that as long

119
00:05:08,892 --> 00:05:11,193
as it's just the three of you on
the board, they can outvote you.

120
00:05:11,195 --> 00:05:12,677
- Aw...
- But the good news is...

121
00:05:12,679 --> 00:05:13,979
- Yay.
- Let me finish.

122
00:05:13,981 --> 00:05:15,530
According to these bylaws,

123
00:05:15,532 --> 00:05:18,183
you as founder have
the unilateral right

124
00:05:18,185 --> 00:05:20,569
to name a fourth
person to the board.

125
00:05:20,571 --> 00:05:22,545
And in the case of a tie
vote, you also have the

126
00:05:22,570 --> 00:05:23,770
right to break that tie.

127
00:05:23,957 --> 00:05:26,216
So, if I put someone
on the board and the

128
00:05:26,241 --> 00:05:27,441
vote's two-two, I win.

129
00:05:27,745 --> 00:05:28,710
Right.

130
00:05:28,712 --> 00:05:30,796

00:07:28,248 --> 00:07:31,482
um, is there an honorarium
or a stipend

175
00:07:31,484 --> 00:07:33,168
for members of the board?

176
00:07:33,170 --> 00:07:34,836
Nothing to speak of.
Oh.

177
00:07:34,838 --> 00:07:36,004
$50,000 a year.

178
00:07:39,242 --> 00:07:40,475

I'm celebrating out of both ends
of my body.

180
00:07:43,513 --> 00:07:45,046
I shudder to think what would
have happened

181
00:07:45,048 --> 00:07:46,664
if I'd have said
a hundred thousand.

182
00:07:46,666 --> 00:07:49,551
We would've had
to drain the tub.

183

Well, anyway, it's great to know
you're on my team.

Oh, absolutely.
You can count on me.

You know we're just gonna

But before we get to voting,

I'd like to introduce you to

00:08:33,770 --> 00:08:35,553
Wanna tell 'em, Alan?

Mmm. Hold on.

199
00:08:37,574 --> 00:08:39,023
Lox.

200
00:08:40,609 --> 00:08:42,860
Walden put me on the board.

You can't do that!

Oh, but I can.

I told you I'm
gonna change the name.

00:08:57,627 --> 00:08:59,744

It states that Walden,
as founder,

00:09:03,249 --> 00:09:04,382
has the unrestricted right

211
00:09:04,384 --> 00:09:06,534

Really looking forward

213
00:09:08,371 --> 00:09:10,671
Aye.

00:09:10,673 --> 00:09:11,839
Alan, wait till there's a vote.

215
00:09:11,841 --> 00:09:13,858
Oh, okay.
Um, you know, there's no way

216
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:15,543
we're gonna finish
all this food.

217
00:09:15,545 --> 00:09:17,979

00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:27,238
Okay, I would like to move that
I be reinstated as president.

221
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:29,774
All in favor? Aye.

Walden, why are
you doing this?

225

Bridget and I are just
going to vote no and then

226
00:09:41,098 --> 00:09:42,298

I just wanna be clear

00:14:37,293 --> 00:14:38,910
Great.

353
00:14:45,585 --> 00:14:47,269
Certainly not some
expensive cognac

354
00:14:47,271 --> 00:14:49,805
and a happy ending in
the men's room.

355
00:14:50,423 --> 00:14:52,724
♪ Men. ♪

356
00:14:52,726 --> 00:14:55,593
So, Alan, are we all set
for tomorrow's board meeting?

357
00:14:55,595 --> 00:14:58,146
Boy, I want to say yes...

358
00:14:58,148 --> 00:14:59,564
What do you mean?

359
00:14:59,566 --> 00:15:00,949
I thought we had
an understanding.

360
00:15:00,951 --> 00:15:05,070
Gee, I wish I
could say we do...

361
00:15:05,072 --> 00:15:07,706
Alan, sweetie,
are you saying

362
00:15:07,708 --> 00:15:12,294
that we can't count on you?

363
00:15:12,296 --> 00:15:14,413
I knew it!
Walden got to him.

364
00:15:14,415 --> 00:15:16,715
Hang on, Bridget.
He's a reasonable man.

365
00:15:16,717 --> 00:15:18,450
Right, Alan?

366
00:15:18,452 --> 00:15:19,751
That's not gonna work.

367
00:15:19,753 --> 00:15:23,171
I masturbated three times
before got here.

368
00:15:24,557 --> 00:15:26,458
All right, let's cut
to the chase.

369
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:28,977
What would it take to make you
change your mind?

370
00:15:28,979 --> 00:15:31,146
Oh, really?
You want to play that game?

371
00:15:31,148 --> 00:15:32,297
Okay...

372
00:15:32,299 --> 00:15:35,133
How about
a brand-new red Porsche?

373
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:49,531
I just love being inside you.

374
00:15:50,666 --> 00:15:53,201
Hi.

375
00:15:53,203 --> 00:15:54,586
Hey, hi.

376
00:15:54,588 --> 00:15:56,037
That's a nice car.

377
00:15:56,039 --> 00:15:57,672
Oh, well, uh,

378
00:15:57,674 --> 00:16:01,993
that's what you get when
you save your nickels.

379
00:16:01,995 --> 00:16:04,679
That's three million
nickels, Alan.

380
00:16:04,681 --> 00:16:07,516
It's a lease?

381
00:16:07,518 --> 00:16:09,634
Is there something
you want to tell me

382
00:16:09,636 --> 00:16:10,936
about the board meeting
tomorrow?

383
00:16:12,889 --> 00:16:15,357
I'm weak.

384
00:16:16,392 --> 00:16:18,610
I'm so very weak.

385
00:16:20,346 --> 00:16:22,564
It's okay.

386
00:16:22,566 --> 00:16:25,116
That's why I chose you.

387
00:16:28,871 --> 00:16:30,739
All right, there's
a motion on the table.

388
00:16:30,741 --> 00:16:32,207
Shall Walden Schmidt
be restored to president

389
00:16:32,209 --> 00:16:34,576
of Walden Loves Bridget
Enterprises?

390
00:16:35,878 --> 00:16:37,913
Right after the meeting,
I'm changing the name.

391
00:16:37,915 --> 00:16:38,880
Thank you.

392
00:16:38,882 --> 00:16:40,031
I vote nay.

393
00:16:40,033 --> 00:16:41,032
Nay.

394
00:16:41,034 --> 00:16:42,417
Aye.

395
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:49,707
Aye.

396
00:16:49,709 --> 00:16:52,177
What?
Are you kidding me?

397
00:16:52,179 --> 00:16:54,980
Okay, okay, if it
makes you feel any better,

398
00:16:54,982 --> 00:16:57,148
you're not the first women
I've disappointed.

399
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:01,019
Here, you can have the car back.

400
00:17:01,021 --> 00:17:02,387
It's out of gas.

401
00:17:03,573 --> 00:17:05,574
And unfortunately, Robin,

402
00:17:05,576 --> 00:17:09,561
I can't return what you gave me,
but I really enjoyed it.

403
00:17:10,496 --> 00:17:13,281
I should have known
you had a hand in this.

404
00:17:16,919 --> 00:17:19,671
All right, I use my founder's
vote to break the tie,

405
00:17:19,673 --> 00:17:22,007
I am reinstated
as president,

406
00:17:22,009 --> 00:17:23,675
and as my first
official act,

407
00:17:23,677 --> 00:17:26,428
I would like to change
the name of the company

408
00:17:26,430 --> 00:17:29,747
to Walden Loves Alan
Enterprises.

409
00:17:29,749 --> 00:17:31,249
Oh!

410
00:17:32,935 --> 00:17:34,970
This meeting's adjourned.
Shall we?

411
00:17:34,972 --> 00:17:36,304
With pleasure.

412
00:17:37,139 --> 00:17:39,474
Oh, it was lovely
to see you again.

413
00:17:45,264 --> 00:17:46,931

415
00:17:57,952 --> 00:18:00,065
You know, as long
as we're in the business

416
00:18:00,066 --> 00:18:01,982
of investing in
high-tech ideas...

417
00:18:01,984 --> 00:18:06,019
a while back, I invented
a little chiropractic device

418
00:18:06,021 --> 00:18:08,355
that allows people
to adjust their own backs.

419
00:18:08,357 --> 00:18:09,406
No kidding?

420
00:18:09,408 --> 00:18:11,792
Yeah. I call it
"Accu-Crack."

421
00:18:11,794 --> 00:18:13,077
Catchy.

422
00:18:13,079 --> 00:18:13,863
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah.

423
00:18:13,888 --> 00:18:15,288
Only problem is there's
a caulking gun,

424
00:18:15,364 --> 00:18:18,332
a reggae band and a porn site
with the same name.

425
00:18:18,334 --> 00:18:20,050
Why don't you just change
the name?

426
00:18:20,052 --> 00:18:21,669
Mm... I would,

427
00:18:21,671 --> 00:18:24,338
but I already printed out
30,000 brochures.

428
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:26,390
Well, tell me about the product.

429
00:18:26,392 --> 00:18:27,424
How does it work?

430
00:18:27,426 --> 00:18:28,709
Oh, really, really simple.

431
00:18:28,711 --> 00:18:30,878
It's two hard rubber balls
attached to a stick

432
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:33,597
that you lay on and move
up and down your spine.

433
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:36,066
How is that high-tech?

434
00:18:36,068 --> 00:18:40,888
Uh... we'd sell it
over the Internet?

435
00:18:40,890 --> 00:18:43,440
Well, I'll certainly
consider it.

436
00:18:43,442 --> 00:18:44,358
Really?

437
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:45,609
Please don't push this, Alan.

438
00:18:45,611 --> 00:18:48,061
Oh, oh!

439
00:18:49,498 --> 00:18:50,581
As agreed upon.

440
00:18:50,583 --> 00:18:52,783
Oh, oh, is this what
I think it is?

441
00:18:52,785 --> 00:18:53,868
Yeah, a deal's a deal.

442
00:18:53,870 --> 00:18:55,870
I get your vote on the board
of my company,

443
00:18:55,872 --> 00:18:57,955
you get your name on the deed
to the house.

444
00:18:57,957 --> 00:18:59,540
Oh, my God.

445
00:18:59,542 --> 00:19:00,591
Congratulations.

446
00:19:00,593 --> 00:19:01,959
Does this mean
I can borrow against it?

447
00:19:01,961 --> 00:19:03,427
- No.
- Sell it?

448
00:19:03,429 --> 00:19:04,845
- No.
- Have the big bedroom upstairs?

449
00:19:04,847 --> 00:19:05,913
No.

450
00:19:05,915 --> 00:19:07,047
Can I tell women it's my house?

451
00:19:07,049 --> 00:19:09,633
