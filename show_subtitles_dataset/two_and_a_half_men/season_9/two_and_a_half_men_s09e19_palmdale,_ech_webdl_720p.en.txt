1
00:00:04,054 --> 00:00:05,765
I miss you, too,
but what are you doing up?

2
00:00:05,766 --> 00:00:08,817
Isn't it, like, 3:00
in the morning in London?

3
00:00:08,819 --> 00:00:11,286
Yeah, I've been having trouble
sleeping, too.

4
00:00:11,288 --> 00:00:16,107
Alan suggested warm milk
and masturbation,

5
00:00:16,109 --> 00:00:19,628
but that's his answer
for pretty much everything.

6
00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:21,163
No, don't worry.

7
00:00:21,165 --> 00:00:23,081
He's not gonna live here
forever.

8
00:00:23,083 --> 00:00:26,001
More importantly, uh,
when are you coming back?

9
00:00:26,003 --> 00:00:30,121
Ugh! Really, another week?

10
00:00:30,123 --> 00:00:31,723
All right, that settles it.

11
00:00:31,725 --> 00:00:34,092
I'm gonna heat up some milk.

12
00:00:34,094 --> 00:00:36,628
Okay, all right.

13
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:38,463
Try to get some sleep.

14
00:00:38,465 --> 00:00:40,065
I love you.

15
00:00:40,067 --> 00:00:43,635
No, I love you more.

16
00:00:43,637 --> 00:00:45,771
No, uh-uh, I love you more.

17
00:00:50,811 --> 00:00:52,661
You got a problem with love?

18
00:00:52,663 --> 00:00:54,813
Uh-uh.
No, no.

19
00:00:56,499 --> 00:00:58,116
Sorry.

20
00:00:58,118 --> 00:00:59,651
Oh, it's Jake and his friend.

21
00:00:59,653 --> 00:01:03,154
No, he's not gonna stay here
forever, either.

22
00:01:04,958 --> 00:01:06,925
All right, bye-bye.
Sweet dreams.

23
00:01:06,927 --> 00:01:10,179
Sorry, we'll get out
of your way.

24
00:01:10,181 --> 00:01:11,430
Nah, that's okay.

25

What are you guys doing?

26
00:01:13,184 --> 00:01:15,184
Well, we were gonna
play a video game

27
00:01:15,186 --> 00:01:17,352
on the big screen,
but if you're busy...

28
00:01:17,354 --> 00:01:18,303
No, no, come on.

29
00:01:18,305 --> 00:01:20,489
Nice.
Awesome.

30
00:01:20,491 --> 00:01:21,523
Where's your dad?

31
00:01:21,525 --> 00:01:23,308
Oh, he's out with
this guy's mom.

32
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:24,810
Yeah, they're picking
my grandma up

33
00:01:24,812 --> 00:01:26,778
at the International House
of Old People.

34
00:01:28,565 --> 00:01:31,182
I-Hoop.

35
00:01:31,184 --> 00:01:33,184
She's in a rest home?

36
00:01:33,186 --> 00:01:35,353
I guess
they're resting.

37
00:01:35,355 --> 00:01:37,706
They don't move
very much.

38
00:01:37,708 --> 00:01:39,124
Oh, except on pudding day.

39
00:01:39,126 --> 00:01:41,326
Uh, then you could
get trampled.

40
00:01:41,328 --> 00:01:44,546
Wow. Your dad's meeting
his girlfriend's mother.

41
00:01:44,548 --> 00:01:46,215
That's a big step.

42
00:01:46,217 --> 00:01:48,050
What's bigger than
boning each other?

43
00:01:48,052 --> 00:01:49,064
Shut up!

44
00:01:49,089 --> 00:01:50,834
Come on. We both
know they're doing it.

45
00:01:50,971 --> 00:01:52,838
- We've heard them.
- Dude!

46
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:55,641
Oh, Alan!
Oh, Lyndsey!

47
00:01:55,643 --> 00:01:57,976
Okay, quit it,
or I'm leaving.

48
00:01:57,978 --> 00:01:59,177
Okay, fine.

49
00:01:59,179 --> 00:02:00,345
And I'm taking my game.

50
00:02:00,347 --> 00:02:02,014
I apologize.
Accepted.

51
00:02:02,016 --> 00:02:05,017
It's nice you guys have a sense
of humor about that stuff.

52
00:02:05,019 --> 00:02:08,070
So many kids of divorce are,
like, so angry all the time.

53
00:02:08,072 --> 00:02:10,105
Yeah, well, it's kind of
hard to stay angry

54
00:02:10,107 --> 00:02:12,107
when you smoke
as much pot as we do.

55
00:02:12,109 --> 00:02:14,243
Truth.

56
00:02:14,245 --> 00:02:18,780
When my dad left, I was, like,
really angry.

57
00:02:18,782 --> 00:02:19,915
What did you do?

58
00:02:19,917 --> 00:02:21,166
Just channeled my energy

59
00:02:21,168 --> 00:02:22,701
into learning how
to program computers.

60

Looking forward to
seeing your mother?

73
00:02:51,893 --> 00:02:53,409
Not at all.

74
00:02:53,411 --> 00:02:55,411
I'm high as a kite.

75
00:02:56,213 --> 00:02:57,764
If I'm looking forward
to anything,

76

it's for that second
muscle relaxer to kick in.

77
00:03:00,919 --> 00:03:03,853
I hear you. Unfortunately,
I can't do that with my mom.

78
00:03:03,855 --> 00:03:05,355
I have to stay alert.

79
00:03:05,357 --> 00:03:08,858
Dinner with her is like being
trapped in a box with a snake.

80
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:11,027
My mom's more like a hamster.

81
00:03:11,029 --> 00:03:13,229
They seem cuddly,
but they eat their young.

82
00:03:13,231 --> 00:03:14,931
Can't wait to meet her.

83
00:03:14,933 --> 00:03:16,149
Oh, you'll love her.

84
00:03:16,151 --> 00:03:18,100
Everybody loves her.

85
00:03:18,102 --> 00:03:20,453
She's sweet, shy and charming.

86
00:03:20,455 --> 00:03:23,206
Unless you happened
to come out of her uterus,

87
00:03:23,208 --> 00:03:25,375
then you're part
of a balanced breakfast.

88
00:03:25,377 --> 00:03:26,626
That bad, huh?

89
00:03:26,628 --> 00:03:29,496
Yeah, and it's gotten worse
since my dad died.

90
00:03:29,498 --> 00:03:31,297
Oh, she must have loved him
very much.

91
00:03:31,299 --> 00:03:32,749
Nah, hated his guts.

92
00:03:32,751 --> 00:03:34,501
She tried to kill him once.

93
00:03:34,503 --> 00:03:35,585
You're kidding.

94
00:03:35,587 --> 00:03:36,786
Yeah, they were playing golf.

95
00:03:36,788 --> 00:03:37,921
He gave her a swing tip.

96
00:03:37,923 --> 00:03:39,889
She hit him on the head
with a pitching wedge.

97
00:03:39,891 --> 00:03:41,474
A-a pitching wedge?

98
00:03:41,476 --> 00:03:42,959
It was the right club.

99
00:03:42,961 --> 00:03:44,811
They were about 90 yards out.

100
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:48,231
Anyway, when he finally died
years later,

101
00:03:48,233 --> 00:03:50,483
she decided
he was the love of her life,

102
00:03:50,485 --> 00:03:51,734
moved into
a retirement community,

103
00:03:51,736 --> 00:03:54,070
and put a "gone fishing sign"
on her hoo-ha.

104
00:03:54,072 --> 00:03:58,608
Okay, guess I shouldn't
mention golf during dinner.

105
00:03:58,610 --> 00:04:00,243
Mm.

106
00:04:00,245 --> 00:04:01,778
Or fishing.

00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:04,831
Yeah. You might also want
to stay away from politics,

109
00:04:06,918 --> 00:04:07,917
The Price Is Right?

110
00:04:07,919 --> 00:04:08,918
She misses Bob Barker.

111
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:10,119
Hates Drew Carey.

112
00:04:10,121 --> 00:04:11,487
Oh, really?

113
00:04:11,489 --> 00:04:13,289

of fresh air.

Man, I used to be a lot better

123

I guess
I'm just out of practice.

124
00:04:34,946 --> 00:04:36,696
That's 'cause
you got a girlfriend now.

125
00:04:36,698 --> 00:04:38,681
Yeah. Your thumbs
have gotten weak.

126
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:42,035
That's why
I choose to be a bachelor.

127
00:04:42,037 --> 00:04:43,469
Yeah, that's why.

I mean, I love her and all,

Hell, yeah.
She's hot.

134
00:04:57,218 --> 00:04:58,801
It's not about how hot she is.

Oh, thank you, Jake.

136
00:05:00,889 --> 00:05:03,323
It's about whether
she stays hot.

137
00:05:07,261 --> 00:05:09,762
I mean, plus, there's some
serious stuff to consider.

138
00:05:09,764 --> 00:05:12,732
She has a daughter,
so I'd be a stepdad.

139
00:05:12,734 --> 00:05:14,817
My stepdad's a pretty cool guy.

140
00:05:14,819 --> 00:05:16,986
I mean, he's always
slipping me money.

141
00:05:16,988 --> 00:05:19,322
I think he feels bad
about replacing my dad.

142
00:05:19,324 --> 00:05:21,858
Or about banging
your mom.

143
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:23,076

00:06:34,232 --> 00:06:35,515
That's good,

180
00:06:35,517 --> 00:06:38,184
'cause even if Lyndsey
could bear another child,

181
00:06:38,186 --> 00:06:41,470
I'm not sure
that would be the smartest move.

182
00:06:41,472 --> 00:06:43,305
Mom!

183
00:06:43,307 --> 00:06:44,607
Tell the truth.

184
00:06:44,609 --> 00:06:46,492
Do you want another one
like Eldridge?

185
00:06:46,494 --> 00:06:48,945
Let's just change
the subject.

186
00:06:48,947 --> 00:06:51,914
Does anybody want
another Eldridge?

187
00:06:53,584 --> 00:06:55,585
How are things
at Sunset Village?

188
00:06:55,587 --> 00:06:57,787
Same old, same old.

189
00:06:57,789 --> 00:07:00,039
Well, actually, some
of the same old died,

190
00:07:00,041 --> 00:07:01,624
so we got some new old.

191
00:07:01,626 --> 00:07:03,626
Oh, th's awful.

192
00:07:03,628 --> 00:07:05,128
Not really.

193
00:07:05,130 --> 00:07:07,630
If you get to their condo
before the relatives,

194
00:07:07,632 --> 00:07:09,832
you can score
some great stuff.

195
00:07:09,834 --> 00:07:12,135
Oh, Mom,
you're not saying...

196
00:07:12,137 --> 00:07:14,520
How do you think
I got this lovely sweater?

197
00:07:14,522 --> 00:07:16,500
It certainly wasn't
a Mother's Day gift.

198
00:07:17,942 --> 00:07:19,559
Well, uh,

199
00:07:19,561 --> 00:07:22,812
if it comes up,
I'm a 40 regular.

200
00:07:26,450 --> 00:07:30,119
So, Mom, do you want to do
anything special this weekend?

201
00:07:30,121 --> 00:07:32,572
I'll be happy doing
whatever you want.

202
00:07:32,574 --> 00:07:35,024
Oh, well, I-I thought maybe
tomorrow we could have lunch

203
00:07:35,026 --> 00:07:38,294
at the Santa Monica Pier,
then go for a walk on the beach.

204
00:07:38,296 --> 00:07:40,496
Oh, okay.

205
00:07:41,331 --> 00:07:43,299
We don't have to.

206
00:07:43,301 --> 00:07:44,834
No, that's fine.

207
00:07:44,836 --> 00:07:47,470
I'm not afraid of
homeless people.

208
00:07:48,839 --> 00:07:51,390
You know, your
daughter's a good lady.

209
00:07:51,392 --> 00:07:53,593
You did a great
job with her, Jean.

210
00:07:53,595 --> 00:07:55,144
Thanks.

211
00:07:55,146 --> 00:07:57,313
But it was touch and go
for a while.

212
00:07:58,682 --> 00:08:01,317
She told you about her
show business career, right?

213
00:08:01,319 --> 00:08:03,236
Seriously, Mom? Really?

214
00:08:03,238 --> 00:08:05,688
What? It was a
very nice movie...

215
00:08:05,690 --> 00:08:07,907
if you like pornography.

216
00:08:07,909 --> 00:08:11,727
Okay, I-I saw it, and-and
it wasn't pornography.

217
00:08:11,729 --> 00:08:14,280
Well, it wasn't Mary Poppins.

218
00:08:18,418 --> 00:08:20,203
So,

219
00:08:20,205 --> 00:08:21,788
you guys graduate this year,
right?

220
00:08:21,790 --> 00:08:22,922
I do.

221
00:08:22,924 --> 00:08:24,040
I do, too.

222
00:08:24,042 --> 00:08:25,708
Well, that's what
you said last year.

223
00:08:25,710 --> 00:08:29,362
Yeah, but now, they're one
more year sicker of me.

224
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:32,715
So what are you gonna do now?

225
00:08:32,717 --> 00:08:35,768
Well, we were hoping
we could work for you.

226
00:08:38,772 --> 00:08:40,273
Doing what?

227
00:08:41,108 --> 00:08:44,393
We'd be, like, consultants.

228
00:08:44,395 --> 00:08:48,114
And what would you
be consulting about?

229
00:08:48,116 --> 00:08:50,283
Well, that would be
our first consultation.

230
00:08:53,704 --> 00:08:55,037
How about this?

231
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:57,406
We could tell you
what kids these days are into

232
00:08:57,408 --> 00:08:59,759
and then develop killer apps
to target that geographic.

233
00:09:01,545 --> 00:09:03,579
Demographic.

234
00:09:03,581 --> 00:09:04,997
No, Republican kids, too.

235
00:09:04,999 --> 00:09:06,966
Mm.

236
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:12,471
All right, Consultants,

237
00:09:12,473 --> 00:09:14,790
tell me some of your app ideas.

238
00:09:14,792 --> 00:09:16,926
Okay, well, you know, uh,

239
00:09:16,928 --> 00:09:20,646
when you take a picture of
your junk and send it to a girl?

240
00:09:22,316 --> 00:09:24,617
Um... no.

241
00:09:25,635 --> 00:09:27,236
But I understand the concept.

242
00:09:27,238 --> 00:09:31,490
Okay, okay, well, this app
makes your junk look bigger.

243
00:09:31,492 --> 00:09:34,260
And you can customize it.

244
00:09:35,696 --> 00:09:37,530
You can customize your junk?

245
00:09:37,532 --> 00:09:39,648
Yeah, you know,
like silly hats,

246
00:09:39,650 --> 00:09:41,650
glasses, little messages.

247
00:09:41,652 --> 00:09:44,637
"Wish you were here."

248
00:09:45,505 --> 00:09:47,590
Get it? Get it?

249
00:09:47,592 --> 00:09:49,342
Yeah, I get it.

250
00:09:49,344 --> 00:09:52,511
So, it's like Photoshop,
but for your junk.

251
00:09:52,513 --> 00:09:55,882
We call it Junkshop.

252
00:09:56,717 --> 00:09:58,134
It's a good name.

253
00:09:58,136 --> 00:10:00,770
What do you do
if you already got big junk?

254
00:10:00,772 --> 00:10:03,055
Oh, way ahead of you.
Tell him about Boobshop.

255
00:10:03,057 --> 00:10:05,858
All right, you know
how girls always complain

256
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:08,194
about one boob being bigger
than the other?

257
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:15,818
Oh, thank God,
she's asleep.

258
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:17,737
I don't think
I can last four days.

259
00:10:17,739 --> 00:10:19,855
Every word out of her mouth
pushes my buttons.

260
00:10:19,857 --> 00:10:21,874
Yeah, I saw.
She's like a ninja mom.

261
00:10:21,876 --> 00:10:23,793
She sneaks in,
destroys your will to live,

262
00:10:23,795 --> 00:10:25,527
and then,
disappears without a trace.

263
00:10:25,529 --> 00:10:26,695
So I'm not crazy?

264
00:10:26,697 --> 00:10:27,914
Oh, no, not at all.
Oh.

265
00:10:27,916 --> 00:10:30,082
In fact, it kind of makes me
grateful for my mom.

266
00:10:30,084 --> 00:10:30,883
What do you mean?

267
00:10:30,885 --> 00:10:32,201
Well, there's no sneaking

268
00:10:32,203 --> 00:10:33,386
and stabbing in the back.

269
00:10:33,388 --> 00:10:34,553
She just walks right up to you,

270
00:10:34,555 --> 00:10:36,088
and hits you in the face
with a lead pipe.

271
00:10:37,308 --> 00:10:38,540
I wonder what would happen

272
00:10:38,542 --> 00:10:40,709
if we put them
in the same room together.

273
00:10:40,711 --> 00:10:42,061
Uh. Momageddon.

274
00:10:43,547 --> 00:10:46,882
Although... it wouldn't be
the worst idea in the world.

275
00:10:46,884 --> 00:10:47,716
What?

276
00:10:47,718 --> 00:10:48,985
Well, think about it.

277
00:10:48,987 --> 00:10:50,820
They're around the same age,
they're single,

278
00:10:50,822 --> 00:10:53,606
they're both deeply disappointed
in their children

279
00:10:53,608 --> 00:10:56,525
and their children's children.

280
00:10:56,527 --> 00:10:57,860
They might hit it off.

281
00:10:57,862 --> 00:11:01,230
And if they did,
it might give us a break.

282
00:11:01,232 --> 00:11:02,415
You know what? Tell you what...

283
00:11:02,417 --> 00:11:04,867
I will call my mom
and try to set up a dinner.

284
00:11:04,869 --> 00:11:06,035
Oh, Alan,

285
00:11:06,037 --> 00:11:07,736
that would
be wonderful. Mm.

286
00:11:07,738 --> 00:11:09,338
I owe you one.

287
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:11,924
You still owe me one
from my birthday.

288
00:11:11,926 --> 00:11:14,043
Well...

289
00:11:14,045 --> 00:11:16,262
if she wasn't here,
I'd be steering this car

290
00:11:16,264 --> 00:11:18,580
with the back
of my head right now.

291
00:11:21,718 --> 00:11:23,719
Looks like she's
sleeping pretty good.

292
00:11:26,356 --> 00:11:28,357
Oh, what the hell?
Scoot your seat back.

293
00:11:29,192 --> 00:11:31,944
Yay!

294
00:11:39,743 --> 00:11:41,393
♪ Men.

295
00:11:42,228 --> 00:11:43,462
Hey, what you doing?

296
00:11:43,464 --> 00:11:44,730
Absolutely nothing.

297
00:11:44,732 --> 00:11:46,098
I'm bored out of my mind.

298
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:48,100
Oh, well, Lyndsey and I
are having dinner with our moms.

299
00:11:48,102 --> 00:11:49,151
You're welcome to join us.

300
00:11:49,153 --> 00:11:51,086
A two-mom dinner?

301
00:11:51,088 --> 00:11:52,071
You can say no.

302
00:11:52,073 --> 00:11:53,772
No. God, no.

303
00:11:53,774 --> 00:11:55,140
I get you.

304
00:11:55,142 --> 00:11:56,525
I don't want to go, either.

305
00:11:56,527 --> 00:11:57,993
Why are you
doing it?

306
00:11:58,828 --> 00:12:00,362
Are you thinking
about getting married?

307
00:12:00,364 --> 00:12:02,748
Um, to answer your questions
in reverse order:

308
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:04,700
not at the moment and oral sex.

309
00:12:04,702 --> 00:12:05,918
Night.

310
00:12:08,588 --> 00:12:11,957
Oral sex.

311
00:12:11,959 --> 00:12:14,159
Time to warm up the old milk.

312
00:12:15,345 --> 00:12:16,595
Oh, great, Amy.

313
00:12:16,597 --> 00:12:18,180
We'll be there.

314
00:12:18,182 --> 00:12:19,298
What's going on?

315
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:20,382
Just got invited

316
00:12:20,384 --> 00:12:22,301
to a slammin' party
in the Valley.

317
00:12:22,303 --> 00:12:23,335
Cool.

318
00:12:23,337 --> 00:12:25,337
Can we borrow your car?

319
00:12:27,974 --> 00:12:30,392
Uh, all right, let me think.

320
00:12:30,394 --> 00:12:34,446
Two potheads want to borrow
my $100,000 car

321
00:12:34,448 --> 00:12:37,182
to go to a slammin' party
in the Valley.

322
00:12:38,034 --> 00:12:39,284
Sounds like a no.

323
00:12:39,286 --> 00:12:40,486
Wait, wait, wait.

324
00:12:40,488 --> 00:12:41,820
Let's hear him out.

325
00:12:41,822 --> 00:12:43,989
It's a no!

326
00:12:45,325 --> 00:12:47,126
I'll give you guys a ride.

327
00:12:47,128 --> 00:12:48,744
- Oh, sweet.
- Thanks.

328
00:12:48,746 --> 00:12:50,295
What you got going on
with the water?

329
00:12:50,297 --> 00:12:52,665
Oh, we had another idea
for an app.

330
00:12:52,667 --> 00:12:55,300
Let me guess... Sinkshop.

331
00:12:55,302 --> 00:12:56,585
Oh, no, no.

332
00:12:56,587 --> 00:12:58,854
Okay, imagine the app
is on my phone.

333
00:12:58,856 --> 00:13:00,222
- All right.
- Go ahead.

334
00:13:01,308 --> 00:13:03,225
Now, all I do

335
00:13:03,227 --> 00:13:05,711
is press this button,
and our app will tell you

336
00:13:05,713 --> 00:13:08,998
exactly how long you can
hold your breath underwater.

337
00:13:14,354 --> 00:13:15,721
That's clever.

338
00:13:15,723 --> 00:13:16,905
Thanks.

339
00:13:16,907 --> 00:13:18,724
How is it different
than the stopwatch

340
00:13:18,726 --> 00:13:19,942
that's already
on your phone?

341
00:13:19,944 --> 00:13:21,393
The what?

342
00:13:21,395 --> 00:13:23,996
See this
little clock?

343
00:13:25,115 --> 00:13:26,915
Oh.

344
00:13:26,917 --> 00:13:29,401
Damn.

345
00:13:29,403 --> 00:13:31,687
How long?

346
00:13:35,508 --> 00:13:36,842
So this is nice, huh?

347
00:13:36,844 --> 00:13:37,926
Lovely.

348
00:13:37,928 --> 00:13:39,411
I can't remember
how long it's been

349
00:13:39,413 --> 00:13:41,413
since the last time
you called me to have dinner.

350
00:13:41,415 --> 00:13:43,048
Oh, come on. It hasn't
been that long.

351
00:13:43,050 --> 00:13:45,917
Oh, please.
Jake was still cute.

352
00:13:45,919 --> 00:13:48,253
Guess it has been awhile.

353
00:13:48,255 --> 00:13:49,605
So what's up with this dinner?

354
00:13:49,607 --> 00:13:52,024
Why are you finally allowing me
to meet your girlfriend?

355
00:13:52,026 --> 00:13:53,525
First of all, I wasn't
disallowing you

356
00:13:53,527 --> 00:13:55,093
from meeting her;
I was just, uh...

357
00:13:55,095 --> 00:13:57,396
avoiding it as long as possible.

358
00:13:58,765 --> 00:14:00,766
Uh, but things
are more serious between us now,

359
00:14:00,768 --> 00:14:02,151
and I thought it might be nice

360
00:14:02,153 --> 00:14:04,069
for you two
to get to know each other.

361
00:14:04,071 --> 00:14:06,605
- All right.
- And her mother might come along.

362
00:14:06,607 --> 00:14:07,656
Her mother?

363
00:14:07,658 --> 00:14:09,241
Yeah, she's, uh,
in town visiting.

364
00:14:09,243 --> 00:14:11,410
I thought you two
might hit it off.

365
00:14:11,412 --> 00:14:15,664
Alan, you know
I don't like old people.

366
00:14:16,833 --> 00:14:18,634
I do know, but you'll like her.

367
00:14:18,636 --> 00:14:20,285
She's young at heart,
like you.

368
00:14:20,287 --> 00:14:23,288
I'm young everywhere...
all the parts.

369
00:14:23,290 --> 00:14:24,456
Sure.

370
00:14:24,458 --> 00:14:25,557
What I haven't replaced,

371
00:14:25,559 --> 00:14:28,227
I've had tightened,
bleached or trimmed.

372
00:14:28,229 --> 00:14:30,145
Got it.

373
00:14:30,147 --> 00:14:31,963
So where's
the old biddy live?

374
00:14:31,965 --> 00:14:33,298
Palmdale.

375
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:36,318
Palmdale, ech.

376
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,636
Is she married?

377
00:14:37,638 --> 00:14:38,804
Uh, widow.

378
00:14:38,806 --> 00:14:39,822
How'd her husband die?

379
00:14:39,824 --> 00:14:40,989
Heart attack.

380
00:14:40,991 --> 00:14:42,241
Boring.

381
00:14:43,526 --> 00:14:45,994
She did actually try
to kill him once.

382
00:14:45,996 --> 00:14:47,112
Oh.

383
00:14:47,114 --> 00:14:48,897
Well, at least we have
something in common.

384
00:14:52,252 --> 00:14:54,253
Sure you gave me
the right address?

385
00:14:54,255 --> 00:14:55,587
Yeah.

386
00:14:55,589 --> 00:14:58,123
1478 Amy Lane.

387
00:14:58,125 --> 00:15:00,125
Wait a sec.

388
00:15:00,127 --> 00:15:03,762
Isn't Amy Lane the name
of the chick having the party?

389
00:15:06,132 --> 00:15:09,618
It may not be Amy Lane.

390
00:15:11,771 --> 00:15:15,724
But we're on
Amy Lane.

391
00:15:15,726 --> 00:15:18,477
An amazing coincidence, huh?

392
00:15:19,696 --> 00:15:21,814
Is there somebody
you guys can call?

393
00:15:21,816 --> 00:15:23,515
I mean,
I can call Amy Lane.

394
00:15:23,517 --> 00:15:26,819
If that is, in fact,
her real name.

395
00:15:31,825 --> 00:15:35,026
Evelyn, Alan tells me
you do a lot of traveling.

396
00:15:35,028 --> 00:15:36,662
Yes. I love it.

397
00:15:36,664 --> 00:15:39,464
The classical architecture,
the exotic cuisine,

398
00:15:39,466 --> 00:15:41,032
the uncircumcised men.

399
00:15:42,837 --> 00:15:44,753
Although one could make a case

400
00:15:44,755 --> 00:15:47,038
that falls under
"exotic cuisine."

401
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:51,226
Just like you and
Alan in the car.

402
00:15:56,266 --> 00:15:57,900
Do you guys travel much?

403
00:15:57,902 --> 00:15:59,384
Not anymore.

404
00:15:59,386 --> 00:16:02,521
But when my husband was alive,
we went everywhere.

405
00:16:02,523 --> 00:16:06,158
Six Flags, Epcot, Dollywood.

406
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:07,559
Charming.

407
00:16:07,561 --> 00:16:09,494
Real globe-trotter.

408
00:16:09,496 --> 00:16:12,564
Speaking of which, I once slept
with Meadowlark Lemon.

409
00:16:13,917 --> 00:16:15,617
Let me tell you,

410
00:16:15,619 --> 00:16:18,754
basketballs weren't
the only thing he could spin.

411
00:16:21,257 --> 00:16:23,408
I'm so sorry.

412
00:16:24,594 --> 00:16:25,878
I hope this is it.

413
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:27,629
They have a balloon
on the mailbox

414
00:16:27,631 --> 00:16:29,414
that says party.
Mm.

415
00:16:32,585 --> 00:16:34,836
Yeah?

416
00:16:35,605 --> 00:16:37,923
Uh, is this
where the party is?

417
00:16:37,925 --> 00:16:40,759
Oh, you saw the balloon, huh?

418
00:16:40,761 --> 00:16:42,394
Come on in.

419
00:16:42,396 --> 00:16:43,946
Okay.
Oh, hang on.

420
00:16:43,948 --> 00:16:45,647
Hang on. Excuse us.

421
00:16:45,649 --> 00:16:48,200
Don't you pay attention
in health class?

422
00:16:48,202 --> 00:16:49,568
What are you
talking about?

423
00:16:49,570 --> 00:16:51,386
Stranger danger.

424
00:16:53,823 --> 00:16:55,874
No, he seems okay.

425
00:16:55,876 --> 00:16:58,276
You guys like to wrestle?

426
00:16:58,278 --> 00:17:00,078
Let's book it, dude.

427
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:02,397
Yeah. Walden!
Don't go!

428
00:17:04,450 --> 00:17:06,785
Always a bridesmaid.

429
00:17:15,228 --> 00:17:16,762
Really, Alan?

430
00:17:19,399 --> 00:17:20,916
Why don't I get this?

431
00:17:22,352 --> 00:17:24,486
Well, you got to admit
my plan worked.

432
00:17:24,488 --> 00:17:26,939
They hit it off and left us
pretty much unscathed.

433
00:17:26,941 --> 00:17:29,474
Plus, thanks to your mom,
my mom can now go back

434
00:17:29,476 --> 00:17:31,660
to her retirement community
and show all her girlfriends

435
00:17:31,662 --> 00:17:33,996
what happens
when you Google "Santorum."

436
00:17:36,116 --> 00:17:39,167
Lyndsey, will you take me
to get a tramp stamp?

437
00:17:39,169 --> 00:17:40,585
What?

438
00:17:40,587 --> 00:17:43,205
It's a cute little tattoo
right here.

439
00:17:43,207 --> 00:17:44,489
Evelyn has one.

440
00:17:44,491 --> 00:17:45,707
You do?

441
00:17:45,709 --> 00:17:47,259
I got it in Singapore.

442
00:17:47,261 --> 00:17:50,429
The Chinese characters for:
"Thank you. Come again."

443
00:17:51,931 --> 00:17:54,466
All right, well,
we're done here.

444
00:17:54,468 --> 00:17:55,634
Why don't we head home?

445
00:17:55,636 --> 00:17:57,302
I don't want
to go home.

446
00:17:57,304 --> 00:17:59,337
Evelyn says there's a place
right down the street

447
00:17:59,339 --> 00:18:01,440
where they have music
and dancing.

448
00:18:01,442 --> 00:18:03,191
Oh, I don't think so.
It's getting kind of late.

449
00:18:03,193 --> 00:18:05,060
Yeah, we both have
to work in the morning.

450
00:18:05,062 --> 00:18:06,061
I don't.

451
00:18:06,063 --> 00:18:07,512
Neither do I.

452
00:18:07,514 --> 00:18:09,231
Why don't you two fuddy-duddies
run along

453
00:18:09,233 --> 00:18:11,516
and let Jean and I
have some fun?

454
00:18:11,518 --> 00:18:13,235
How will you get home?

455
00:18:13,237 --> 00:18:15,704
Alan, I made it from Brunei
to Morocco with nothing

456
00:18:15,706 --> 00:18:18,523
but the clothes on my back
and a tube of lubricant.

457
00:18:18,525 --> 00:18:22,044
I think I can get us
from Tarzana to Sherman Oaks.

458
00:18:22,046 --> 00:18:24,379
Isn't she a hoot?

459
00:18:24,381 --> 00:18:27,082
All right,
if you're sure.

460
00:18:27,084 --> 00:18:28,550
Let's go.

461
00:18:29,635 --> 00:18:32,054
You think we'll find
some cute fellas to dance with?

462
00:18:32,056 --> 00:18:34,006
Oh, Jean, Jean, Jean.

463
00:18:34,008 --> 00:18:36,258
We're not going
to dance.

464
00:18:39,178 --> 00:18:40,846
♪ Men.

465
00:18:40,848 --> 00:18:43,181
Should have written
the address down, dude.

466
00:18:43,183 --> 00:18:44,266
I did write it down.

467
00:18:44,268 --> 00:18:45,884
She must have told it
to me wrong.

468
00:18:45,886 --> 00:18:47,319
Or maybe you
heard it wrong.

469
00:18:47,321 --> 00:18:51,523
If only there was an app that
could capture the spoken word.

470
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:57,162
If only there was an app that
could capture the spoken word.

471
00:18:58,498 --> 00:19:00,082
Don't mock us, man.

472
00:19:00,951 --> 00:19:03,919
Don't mock us, man.

473
00:19:05,237 --> 00:19:07,422
Hi, Jake.

474
00:19:07,957 --> 00:19:08,874
Hi, Eldridge.

475
00:19:08,876 --> 00:19:10,509
- Hey.
- Hi.

476
00:19:11,410 --> 00:19:13,261
I bet they were
at the party.

477
00:19:13,263 --> 00:19:16,081
Yeah, maybe they can
tell us where it is.

478
00:19:16,083 --> 00:19:17,049
Oh, good thinking.

479
00:19:17,051 --> 00:19:18,467
I'll text 'em.

480
00:19:20,252 --> 00:19:22,253
Wait, I don't have
their numbers.

481
00:19:23,106 --> 00:19:26,725
Man, we're never going
to find this party.

482
00:19:27,527 --> 00:19:30,028
Okay.

483
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:33,532
Let me ask you a question.

484
00:19:33,534 --> 00:19:37,035
If you had made it to the party,
what would you have done there?

485
00:19:37,037 --> 00:19:39,604
Try to hook up
with some chicks.

486
00:19:48,197 --> 00:19:50,382
Why don't you hook up with them?

487
00:19:51,884 --> 00:19:55,053
Right there...
that's why you're rich.

488
00:19:56,806 --> 00:20:00,308
Would you mind very much if
we, you know, blew you off?

489
00:20:00,310 --> 00:20:02,427
I would worry about
you if you didn't.

490
00:20:02,429 --> 00:20:04,513
- Bye.
- Later.

491
00:20:05,348 --> 00:20:07,065
Hello, ladies.

492
00:20:07,067 --> 00:20:09,267
Mind if we
hook up with you?

493
00:20:14,739 --> 00:20:16,740
♪ Men.

494
00:20:16,742 --> 00:20:17,991
Morning.
Morning.

495
00:20:17,993 --> 00:20:19,075
Oh, morning.

496
00:20:19,077 --> 00:20:20,443
You and Evelyn have a
good time last night?

497
00:20:20,445 --> 00:20:22,228
Fantastic.
Mm.

498
00:20:22,230 --> 00:20:23,914
I adore your mother.

499
00:20:23,916 --> 00:20:26,249
That's only because
you just met her.

500
00:20:26,251 --> 00:20:29,586
I don't know, I think I got
to know her pretty well.

Good morning,
darling.
