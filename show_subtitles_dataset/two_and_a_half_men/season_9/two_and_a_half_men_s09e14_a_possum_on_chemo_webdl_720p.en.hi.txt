1
00:00:03,822 --> 00:00:05,206
Walden, are you almost ready?

2
00:00:05,208 --> 00:00:07,541
Almost.

3
00:00:08,844 --> 00:00:12,163
How is it possible that I am
always ready before you are?

4
00:00:12,165 --> 00:00:13,914
Hey, it takes a lot of work

5
00:00:13,916 --> 00:00:16,500
to make it look
like I don't care how I look.

6
00:00:16,502 --> 00:00:18,469
Please, let's go.
I'm starving.

7
00:00:18,471 --> 00:00:20,721
Just give me a minute.
I'm having a bad beard day.

8
00:00:20,723 --> 00:00:23,224
Is there such a thing
as a good beard day?

9
00:00:23,226 --> 00:00:25,009
Absolutely.

10
00:00:25,011 --> 00:00:27,094
Usually I wake up,
and it's all soft and fluffy,

11
00:00:27,096 --> 00:00:28,763
but I must have
slept on it wrong,

12
00:00:28,765 --> 00:00:31,148
'cause this side's, like,
flat and listless.

13
00:00:31,150 --> 00:00:33,150
Oh, if it's causing
you such problems,

14
00:00:33,152 --> 00:00:35,269
why don't you
just shave it off?

15
00:00:35,271 --> 00:00:36,904
I thought you loved my beard.

16
00:00:36,906 --> 00:00:38,906
No, I never
said that.

17
00:00:40,742 --> 00:00:43,310
Then why'd you go out
with me in the first place?

18
00:00:43,312 --> 00:00:46,113
I don't judge a person
by what's on the surface.

19
00:00:46,115 --> 00:00:49,366
Yeah, but yet you're asking me
to shave my surface.

20
00:00:49,368 --> 00:00:50,684
Yes, please.

21
00:00:50,686 --> 00:00:52,837
Wow.

22
00:00:52,839 --> 00:00:54,622
I mean, is there anything else

23
00:00:54,624 --> 00:00:56,424
about me that's not
working for you?

24
00:00:56,426 --> 00:00:58,626
As long as you ask,

25
00:00:58,628 --> 00:01:02,763
I'm not crazy about the
Jennifer Aniston hairdo.

26
00:01:08,537 --> 00:01:10,671
Okay. This is...

27
00:01:10,673 --> 00:01:12,723
I'm-I'm... I'm a little...
I'm a little confused here.

28
00:01:12,725 --> 00:01:14,675
I thought you liked
the way I looked.

29
00:01:14,677 --> 00:01:16,277
Oh, I do. I do.

30
00:01:16,279 --> 00:01:19,647
I just think I'd like it better
if the ratio of hair to face

31
00:01:19,649 --> 00:01:22,566
was more on the
face side of things.

32
00:01:22,568 --> 00:01:25,319
Well, I will definitely
give it some thought.

33
00:01:25,321 --> 00:01:28,622
Oh. I don't want you to do
anything you don't want to do.

34
00:01:28,624 --> 00:01:31,525
Although, to be fair, I did
remove some hair for you.

35
00:01:31,527 --> 00:01:34,345
After I almost
choked to death.

36
00:01:38,533 --> 00:01:41,635
Okay, just need to post
a profile picture,

37
00:01:41,637 --> 00:01:44,922
and let the dating begin.

38
00:01:52,764 --> 00:01:54,849
Whoa.

39
00:01:54,851 --> 00:01:57,384
To Catch a Predator.

40
00:02:06,928 --> 00:02:09,113
Hello, sailor!

41
00:02:17,873 --> 00:02:20,708
Wow. More chins
than a Chinese phone book.

42
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:24,745
Hey. We're heading out.

43
00:02:24,747 --> 00:02:26,130
Have a nice dinner.

44
00:02:26,132 --> 00:02:27,965
What are you going
to do tonight?

45
00:02:27,967 --> 00:02:29,633
Well, I don't want
to jinx myself,

46
00:02:29,635 --> 00:02:32,937
but I'm hoping to rub one out
and be asleep by 10:00.

47
00:02:34,439 --> 00:02:35,523
Rub one out?

48
00:02:35,525 --> 00:02:37,308
Oh, he's gonna wait
till we leave,

49
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:38,809
watch some porn
and masturbate.

50
00:02:38,811 --> 00:02:40,611
Ah.

51
00:02:40,613 --> 00:02:42,062
Oh. Ick.

52
00:02:42,064 --> 00:02:43,230
You know what?

53
00:02:43,232 --> 00:02:44,765
Don't just hang
out here alone.

54
00:02:44,767 --> 00:02:47,818
Why don't you just
join us for dinner?

55
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:49,904
Oh, no, no, no. I don't want
to be a third wheel.

56
00:02:49,906 --> 00:02:50,988
You two kids have a great time.

57
00:02:50,990 --> 00:02:53,123
Thank you.
No.

58
00:02:53,125 --> 00:02:54,575
We insist.

59
00:02:54,577 --> 00:02:56,944
Tell him, Zoey.

60
00:02:57,796 --> 00:03:00,014
Do join us, won't you?

61
00:03:00,016 --> 00:03:01,966
Great.

62
00:03:01,968 --> 00:03:03,884
Rain check.
Where we eating?

63
00:03:03,886 --> 00:03:07,421
I was thinking about trying out
that new Italian place on PCH.

64
00:03:07,423 --> 00:03:09,173
Ooh, really? Italian?
That's kind of heavy.

65
00:03:09,175 --> 00:03:10,925
What are you
in the mood for?

66
00:03:10,927 --> 00:03:12,760
Oh, no, no. It's your night.
I'm just tagging along.

67
00:03:12,762 --> 00:03:14,762
I was rather looking
forward to Italian, so...

68
00:03:14,764 --> 00:03:16,964
Well, you heard her.

That's another advantage

Charming.

why don't you grow a beard?

00:04:17,130 --> 00:04:18,880
Oh, I tried.
Grew in patchy.

92
00:04:18,882 --> 00:04:21,248

that men look
much more attractive

95
00:04:25,855 --> 00:04:27,088
when they're
properly groomed.

96
00:04:27,090 --> 00:04:28,272
Really?

97
00:04:28,274 --> 00:04:29,757
I've always been
properly groomed,

98
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:31,809
and all it's gotten me
is two divorces

99
00:04:31,811 --> 00:04:33,361
and carpal tunnel syndrome.

100
00:04:33,363 --> 00:04:36,147
Oh. Ick.

101
00:04:37,032 --> 00:04:39,484
Alan, check out the bar.

102
00:04:42,154 --> 00:04:44,238
Oh. Wow.

103
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,207
She looks fantastic.

104
00:04:46,209 --> 00:04:47,742
Who's that?

105
00:04:47,744 --> 00:04:48,876
It's Alan's old girlfriend.

106
00:04:48,878 --> 00:04:50,545
You're joking.

107
00:04:52,414 --> 00:04:54,298
What's that supposed to mean?

108
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:56,467
Nothing. Well done. Well done.

109
00:04:58,837 --> 00:05:00,755
Alan, go say hello to her.

110
00:05:00,757 --> 00:05:03,457
Oh, I don't know. I mean,
as much as I'd like to see her,

111
00:05:03,459 --> 00:05:05,510
I'm not sure
she still wants to see me.

112
00:05:05,512 --> 00:05:07,178
Uh, it didn't end well.

113
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:08,396
What happened?

114
00:05:08,398 --> 00:05:10,865
Did she catch you
rubbing one out?

115
00:05:11,984 --> 00:05:13,634
- Did I say that right?
- That was perfect.

116
00:05:13,636 --> 00:05:14,819
Yeah? Okay.

117
00:05:16,572 --> 00:05:17,855
Just go say hello to her.

118
00:05:19,642 --> 00:05:21,976
Well, guess
it couldn't hurt.

119
00:05:21,978 --> 00:05:24,112
I mean, she does look
a little pathetic

120
00:05:24,114 --> 00:05:25,947
just sitting there
all by herself

121
00:05:25,949 --> 00:05:28,482
waiting to get hit on
by some loser.

122
00:05:28,484 --> 00:05:30,985
By all means,
save her from that.

123
00:05:31,837 --> 00:05:34,488
All right, wish me luck.

124
00:05:34,490 --> 00:05:36,124
Good luck.

125
00:05:36,126 --> 00:05:38,009
Go get 'em.

126
00:05:38,011 --> 00:05:41,996
Seriously, what's
wrong with her?

127
00:05:41,998 --> 00:05:44,515
Hey, stranger.

128
00:05:44,517 --> 00:05:46,551
Alan!

129
00:05:46,553 --> 00:05:49,020
Hi! How have you been?

130
00:05:49,022 --> 00:05:50,304
Uh, good. Good. You?

131
00:05:50,306 --> 00:05:52,523
Real good.

132
00:05:52,525 --> 00:05:54,809
Well, you look beautiful.

133
00:05:54,811 --> 00:05:56,844
Thank you.

134
00:05:57,679 --> 00:05:59,731
Yeah, I've been
working out.

135
00:05:59,733 --> 00:06:01,232
Good.

136
00:06:01,234 --> 00:06:04,035
Good, good. So, uh, what are
you doing here all by yourself?

137
00:06:04,037 --> 00:06:05,536
- Oh, well...
- Sorry.

138
00:06:05,538 --> 00:06:08,906
I don't think that valet has
ever driven a Ferrari before.

139
00:06:08,908 --> 00:06:11,525
Alan, this is
my friend Dylan.

140
00:06:11,527 --> 00:06:12,710
Dylan, this is Alan.

141
00:06:12,712 --> 00:06:13,961
- Oh, hey.
- Hey, Alan.

142
00:06:13,963 --> 00:06:15,379
Uh, Dylan, huh?

143
00:06:15,381 --> 00:06:16,631
Uh, named after Bob?

144
00:06:16,633 --> 00:06:18,082
No, named after my dad.

145
00:06:18,084 --> 00:06:19,467
He was named after Bob.

146
00:06:19,469 --> 00:06:22,253
Okay. Okay.

147
00:06:22,255 --> 00:06:24,422
Uh, well, it was
nice to meet you.

148
00:06:24,424 --> 00:06:26,841
Uh, Lyndsey, it's always
great to see you.

149
00:06:26,843 --> 00:06:30,094
Um, I-I should get
back to my date.

150
00:06:30,096 --> 00:06:33,414
Yeah, Walden's trying to
set me up with his baby sister.

151
00:06:33,416 --> 00:06:34,432
She's very pretty.

152
00:06:34,434 --> 00:06:36,434
Oh, yeah, she's okay.

153
00:06:44,493 --> 00:06:46,727
Uh, it's a very
close family.

154
00:06:55,921 --> 00:06:58,623
Seems overly complicated.

155
00:06:58,625 --> 00:07:00,758
What?

156
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:03,911
Why don't they just make chips
with the dip already on 'em?

157
00:07:03,913 --> 00:07:06,180
Dude.

158
00:07:06,182 --> 00:07:08,683
Dude...

159
00:07:08,685 --> 00:07:11,252
that's a million-dollar idea.

160
00:07:11,254 --> 00:07:13,921
What is?

161
00:07:13,923 --> 00:07:16,023
Pre-dipped chips.

162
00:07:16,025 --> 00:07:19,927
See, that's
a million-dollar idea.

163
00:07:19,929 --> 00:07:23,097
What's a million-dollar idea?

164
00:07:23,099 --> 00:07:25,700
It's an idea
worth a million dollars.

165
00:07:25,702 --> 00:07:29,987
Boy, I wish I had one of those.

166
00:07:31,491 --> 00:07:33,991
I can't believe they brought
back Beavis and Butt-Head.

167
00:07:33,993 --> 00:07:37,328
Yeah. Those guys are,
like, too stupid to live.

168
00:07:41,885 --> 00:07:43,801
Uh-oh. That's my dad.

169
00:07:43,803 --> 00:07:46,087
Quick, give me
that air freshener.

170
00:07:51,126 --> 00:07:52,927
This is bug spray, dude.

171
00:07:54,796 --> 00:07:56,614
Says it's for roaches.

172
00:07:58,984 --> 00:08:01,152
Perfect.

173
00:08:02,821 --> 00:08:04,305
Just forget about her, Alan.

174
00:08:04,307 --> 00:08:06,691
I'm sure Zoey has some single
friends she can fix you up with.

175
00:08:06,693 --> 00:08:07,942
No, I don't. Sorry.

176
00:08:07,944 --> 00:08:10,945
I just can't get over
how young the guy is.

177
00:08:10,947 --> 00:08:14,131
Well, a clean-shaven face
will do that for a man.

178
00:08:16,201 --> 00:08:17,835
Well, thanks again for dinner.

179
00:08:17,837 --> 00:08:20,821

I was gonna eat both lobsters.

Hey.
Hey.

Is that bug spray?

186
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:36,387
Yeah, we were just
getting rid of some roaches.

187
00:08:37,773 --> 00:08:40,524

to call an exterminator.

188

I ran into your mom tonight.

Really? Was she with Dylan?

194
00:09:05,051 --> 00:09:06,550
Yeah, yeah.
Have you met him?

195
00:09:06,552 --> 00:09:08,719
What's he like?
Is it serious?

196
00:09:08,721 --> 00:09:11,072
I doubt it. He's gay.

about the guy with the Ferrari?

Yeah. Dylan.

202
00:09:22,602 --> 00:09:24,919
I once saw him wearing
my mom's underwear.

203
00:09:24,921 --> 00:09:28,072
Oh, well, that doesn't mean
he's gay. He...

pretty things.

Yeah.

207
00:09:40,036 --> 00:09:42,203
Yeah, all the time.

Not a word.

00:15:49,625 --> 00:15:51,208
What's wrong
with your ass?

357
00:15:51,210 --> 00:15:54,127
Oh, Alan.

358
00:15:54,129 --> 00:15:56,830
That's why
I've missed you so much.

359
00:15:56,832 --> 00:15:58,799
I-I don't get it.

360
00:15:58,801 --> 00:16:02,419
Your standards are
so much lower than Dylan's.

361
00:16:02,421 --> 00:16:04,504
I don't have to worry about
disappointing you.

362
00:16:04,506 --> 00:16:08,008
I do set a low bar.

363
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:10,977
Or worry about you leaving me
for a younger woman.

364
00:16:10,979 --> 00:16:12,696
- Why not?
- You can't get one.

365
00:16:14,565 --> 00:16:16,233
And you want to know
the best part?

366
00:16:16,235 --> 00:16:18,401
It gets better?

367
00:16:18,403 --> 00:16:21,688
I could sit here
and fart like a buffalo,

368
00:16:21,690 --> 00:16:23,790
and you'd still
want to be with me.

369
00:16:25,409 --> 00:16:27,410
Well, with age
comes wisdom.

370
00:16:29,031 --> 00:16:31,164
A fella learns to breathe
through his mouth.

371
00:16:32,417 --> 00:16:33,816
Come here, you.

372
00:16:41,325 --> 00:16:42,992
You're testing
me, aren't you?

373
00:16:42,994 --> 00:16:44,294
I am.

374
00:16:49,885 --> 00:16:51,551
Hang on.

375
00:16:53,437 --> 00:16:57,357
Whew! That's a dead buffalo.

376
00:17:00,010 --> 00:17:01,511
- Oh, hey, Zoey.
- Hi, Alan.

377
00:17:01,513 --> 00:17:02,529
Is Walden here?

378
00:17:02,531 --> 00:17:03,780
Uh, you know, I'm not sure.

379
00:17:03,782 --> 00:17:04,948
I haven't seen him all day.

380
00:17:04,950 --> 00:17:06,449
Uh, Walden,
you up there?

381
00:17:06,451 --> 00:17:07,551
Coming!

382
00:17:08,687 --> 00:17:09,903
Uh, oh, Lyndsey, Zoey.

383
00:17:09,905 --> 00:17:11,121
Zoey, Lyndsey.
Hi.

384
00:17:11,123 --> 00:17:12,205
Hi.

385
00:17:12,207 --> 00:17:13,623
We just got
back together.

386
00:17:13,625 --> 00:17:14,624
Really?

387
00:17:14,626 --> 00:17:16,426
Oh, did that lovely boy die?

388
00:17:17,628 --> 00:17:19,796
Zoey?

389
00:17:19,798 --> 00:17:20,797
Hmm?

390
00:17:33,378 --> 00:17:35,562
Oh, my God.

391
00:17:35,564 --> 00:17:36,846
Look at you.

392
00:17:36,848 --> 00:17:38,181
You like it?

393
00:17:38,183 --> 00:17:40,233
Like it?

394
00:17:40,235 --> 00:17:42,769
I'm tempted to rub one out.

395
00:17:45,723 --> 00:17:47,307
But why?

396
00:17:47,309 --> 00:17:49,826
Well, it turns out, when you
weren't nagging me to do it,

397
00:17:49,828 --> 00:17:50,994
I wanted to.

398
00:17:56,584 --> 00:17:59,486
What are you
doing here?

399
00:17:59,488 --> 00:18:01,621
I came to apologize for nagging.

400
00:18:01,623 --> 00:18:04,074
I had no right
to try and change you.

401
00:18:04,076 --> 00:18:06,493
Thank you.

402
00:18:06,495 --> 00:18:08,678
I also hoped you might elaborate

403
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:11,281
on that "falling in love"
comment.

404
00:18:11,283 --> 00:18:13,750
I don't know what
you're talking about.

405
00:18:15,103 --> 00:18:18,054
All right then, come with me.

406
00:18:18,056 --> 00:18:19,306
Where are we going?

407
00:18:19,308 --> 00:18:21,641
I want to test drive
this new face of yours.

408
00:18:21,643 --> 00:18:23,760
Oh.

409
00:18:23,762 --> 00:18:25,395
Hop on!

410
00:18:29,734 --> 00:18:32,235
That poor girl.

411
00:18:32,237 --> 00:18:35,488
Yeah, he looks younger
and prettier than before.

412
00:18:37,270 --> 00:18:39,626
She's gonna have to hold in her
farts till the Fourth of July.

413
00:18:39,627 --> 00:18:41,827
Mm-hmm.

414
00:18:44,278 --> 00:18:46,129
♪ Men.

415
00:18:46,131 --> 00:18:48,214
Here's your
cranberry juice.

416
00:18:48,216 --> 00:18:49,999
Thank you.

417
00:18:50,001 --> 00:18:52,302
So, uh, how will you know

418
00:18:52,304 --> 00:18:54,304
when your lady problems
have cleared up?

419
00:18:54,306 --> 00:18:57,123
I'll be able to pee
without screaming.

420
00:18:59,144 --> 00:19:02,812
Thanks so much
for letting me use your loo.

421
00:19:02,814 --> 00:19:04,514
Oh, any time.

422
00:19:04,516 --> 00:19:06,299
I know it's silly,
but I just don't want Walden

423
00:19:06,301 --> 00:19:08,134
to hear any of
my bathroom noises.

424
00:19:08,136 --> 00:19:09,769
I totally understand.

425
00:19:09,771 --> 00:19:11,438
Thank you. Night.

426
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:13,073
Good night.

427
00:19:14,776 --> 00:19:17,944
Dylan took me to Hawaii
for a week, I didn't crap once.

428
00:19:17,946 --> 00:19:20,997
Is that so?

429
00:19:20,999 --> 00:19:22,699
Thank God he fell asleep
on the flight back.

430
00:19:22,701 --> 00:19:23,917
Why's that?

431
00:19:23,919 --> 00:19:26,286
Gave me a chance to unload.

432
00:19:26,288 --> 00:19:29,456
I put the first-class lavatory
totally out of commission.

433
00:19:29,458 --> 00:19:30,957
Really?
Yeah.

434
00:19:30,959 --> 00:19:33,460
Stewardess thought
it was a terrorist attack.

435
00:19:35,296 --> 00:19:37,097
All right, good night.

436
00:19:38,832 --> 00:19:40,850
Yeah, o-okay.

437
00:19:40,852 --> 00:19:42,001
Good night.

438
00:19:49,727 --> 00:19:52,645
They don't have what we have.

439
00:19:58,018 --> 00:20:00,503
No, they don't.
