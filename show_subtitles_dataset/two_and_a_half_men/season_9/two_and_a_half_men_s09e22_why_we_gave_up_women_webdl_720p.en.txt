00:00:03,375 --> 00:00:06,084
It's spring break this week,
so Zoey and her daughter

3
00:00:06,109 --> 00:00:06,946
are going to stay here.

4
00:00:06,947 --> 00:00:08,975
I'm going to need you
to move out for the week.

5
00:00:09,667 --> 00:00:10,565
Where you staying?

6
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:11,601
I'm just going to have
to stay with Lindsey.

7
00:00:11,602 --> 00:00:14,070
There's someone
in the house. Go look.

8
00:00:16,623 --> 00:00:18,040
Ow!
What?

9
00:00:18,042 --> 00:00:19,709
Ball snag!
I'm sorry!

10
00:00:19,711 --> 00:00:22,244
No, no, don't touch it!

11
00:00:23,213 --> 00:00:24,613
I'm bored.

12
00:00:24,615 --> 00:00:27,116
♪ ♪

13
00:00:31,271 --> 00:00:34,206
I can't do this, Berta.
It's just too much.

14
00:00:34,208 --> 00:00:35,708
She just never stops.

15
00:00:35,710 --> 00:00:38,894
So, how are things going living
with Zoey and her daughter?

16
00:00:38,896 --> 00:00:40,096
It's good. It's good.

17
00:00:40,098 --> 00:00:41,313
Oh.

18
00:00:41,315 --> 00:00:43,048
How's living with Lyndsey?

19
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:45,651
Oh, it's terrific.
That's great.

20
00:00:45,653 --> 00:00:48,571
So, if I could get rid of them...
Yes, 100 times yes.

21
00:00:49,189 --> 00:00:53,576
Men...

22
00:00:53,578 --> 00:00:55,060
Okay.

23
00:00:56,229 --> 00:00:58,397
Zoey...

24
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:00,332
you know I love you, and...

25
00:01:00,334 --> 00:01:02,918
I want to live with you forever.

26
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:04,620
But we got to lose the kid.

27
00:01:07,591 --> 00:01:10,176
- Yeah, probably not.
- Okay.

28
00:01:10,178 --> 00:01:13,412
Hey, have you ever thought
of Swiss boarding schools?

29
00:01:14,931 --> 00:01:16,582
Hi!
Sh...

30
00:01:16,584 --> 00:01:18,134
She's out like a light.

31
00:01:18,136 --> 00:01:22,254
Really? How?
Did you drug her?

32
00:01:22,256 --> 00:01:25,357
I didn't think
we were allowed to drug her.

33
00:01:25,359 --> 00:01:27,777
She's worn out
from playing with you all day.

34
00:01:27,779 --> 00:01:29,695
She's not the only one.

35
00:01:29,697 --> 00:01:33,482
Listen...

36
00:01:33,484 --> 00:01:34,617
I've been thinking about this

37
00:01:34,619 --> 00:01:38,270
whole "moving in together"
thing.

38
00:01:38,272 --> 00:01:41,457
It's all right.
I admit, I had my doubts.

39
00:01:41,459 --> 00:01:44,326
But you have been
so wonderful with her.

40
00:01:44,328 --> 00:01:46,162
Thank you.

41
00:01:46,164 --> 00:01:48,748
This little girl
loves you so much.

42
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:50,132
Really...

43
00:01:50,134 --> 00:01:52,218
You're all she talks about.

44
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:54,670
The sun rises and sets with you.

45
00:01:54,672 --> 00:01:57,156
Huh...

46
00:01:58,809 --> 00:02:00,409
Look at what she made for you.

47
00:02:03,764 --> 00:02:06,799
Wow...

48
00:02:06,801 --> 00:02:09,435
So, you win.
We're all yours.

49
00:02:09,437 --> 00:02:10,486
I mean,

50
00:02:10,488 --> 00:02:12,071
there's a million details
to figure out

51
00:02:12,073 --> 00:02:13,622
before we can move in
permanently.

52
00:02:13,624 --> 00:02:15,708
First and foremost, where she's
going to go to school.

53
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:18,377
Have you ever considered
Switzerland?

54
00:02:18,379 --> 00:02:20,279
You're kidding, right?

55
00:02:20,281 --> 00:02:23,315
I'm ki.. of course!

56
00:02:23,317 --> 00:02:26,452
Why would I want her
so far away?

57
00:02:26,454 --> 00:02:29,588
Let me put her up to bed.
Then we can start making plans.

58
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:30,823
Great.

59
00:02:30,825 --> 00:02:32,258
Mommy?
Hmm?

60
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:33,342
Where's Walden?

61
00:02:33,344 --> 00:02:34,844
Oh, I'm right here.

62
00:02:34,846 --> 00:02:37,263
I love you, Walden.

63
00:02:38,215 --> 00:02:40,466
I love you...

64
00:02:46,439 --> 00:02:48,941
Just like I planned it.

65
00:02:53,947 --> 00:02:55,731
Hey, roomie!

66
00:02:55,733 --> 00:02:57,616
You got here quick.

67
00:02:57,618 --> 00:02:59,535
Yeah, Lyndsey asked me
to fix the garbage disposal

68
00:02:59,537 --> 00:03:02,354
and I didn't like the odds.

69
00:03:02,356 --> 00:03:04,189
So, uh, did you talk
to Zoey yet?

70
00:03:04,191 --> 00:03:05,457
Yes, I did.

71
00:03:05,459 --> 00:03:06,208
How'd she take it?

72
00:03:06,210 --> 00:03:07,993
Well, I... yeah, let's...

73
00:03:07,995 --> 00:03:09,862
Did she cry?

74
00:03:09,864 --> 00:03:11,530
No...
Yelling?

75
00:03:11,532 --> 00:03:13,249
No. There was no yelling.

76
00:03:13,251 --> 00:03:16,585
Yeah, I know that I said
that I wanted to get rid of her

77
00:03:16,587 --> 00:03:18,170
and have you come back...

78
00:03:18,172 --> 00:03:19,638
Oh, no!

79
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:21,640
You know, I, I love her.

80
00:03:21,642 --> 00:03:23,058
Oh, no!

81
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:24,844
And I, I love the kid.

82
00:03:24,846 --> 00:03:26,061
No!

83
00:03:26,063 --> 00:03:27,763
I'm just going
to have to make it work.

84
00:03:27,765 --> 00:03:29,565
No, no, no, no, no, no!

85
00:03:29,567 --> 00:03:32,050
Alan, I'm sorry.

86
00:03:33,570 --> 00:03:36,605
Okay, okay, I'll...
I'll figure something out.

87
00:03:36,607 --> 00:03:39,742
If nothing else,
I am a survivor.

88
00:03:47,285 --> 00:03:49,585
Okay, very funny.
Survivor, I get it.

89
00:03:51,622 --> 00:03:54,874
Oh, come on!
I feel bad enough already.

90
00:03:54,876 --> 00:03:56,508
Help me...

91
00:03:56,510 --> 00:03:57,710
911!

92
00:03:57,712 --> 00:03:59,211
Oh, okay. I'll play along.

You're not kidding?

96
00:04:05,586 --> 00:04:07,052
Not kidding...

97

Why We Gave Up Women

== Encoded, Synced & Corrected by

102
00:04:32,423 --> 00:04:34,692
I want him to have
the best possible care.

103
00:04:34,694 --> 00:04:37,027
So, whatever it takes,
I'll pay for it.

104
00:04:37,029 --> 00:04:38,595
You're going to have to.

105
00:04:38,597 --> 00:04:42,032
The man's got the worst
insurance policy I've ever seen.

106
00:04:42,034 --> 00:04:45,703
What do you mean?
He's got a $500,000 deductible.

107
00:04:45,705 --> 00:04:48,072
A $500,000 deductible?

108
00:04:48,074 --> 00:04:49,540
Even at our prices,
he ain't gonna

109
00:04:49,542 --> 00:04:51,208
hit that with
one heart attack.

110
00:04:51,210 --> 00:04:53,827
All right, well, I'll just...
I'll take care of it.

111
00:04:53,829 --> 00:04:56,447
Just check the box
"Domestic Partner."

112
00:04:56,449 --> 00:04:59,917
Oh, no, we're just buddies.

113
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:02,202
We got no buddy forms.

114
00:05:02,204 --> 00:05:05,305
Yeah, but...
Just check the damn box.

115
00:05:10,428 --> 00:05:14,515
Come out, come out,
wherever you are.

116
00:05:14,517 --> 00:05:17,901
I guess there's nothing
to do now but wait.

117
00:05:17,903 --> 00:05:20,137
Forgive me
for being callous,

118
00:05:20,139 --> 00:05:22,823
but don't you think this heart
attack is a bit convenient?

119
00:05:22,825 --> 00:05:24,858
What?
Come on.

120
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:27,027
He tries to weasel his way
back into the house.

121
00:05:27,029 --> 00:05:28,245
You tell him no

122
00:05:28,247 --> 00:05:30,497
and he falls to the ground,
clutching his chest.

123
00:05:30,499 --> 00:05:32,699
You think he faked
a heart attack?

124
00:05:32,701 --> 00:05:35,669
I think he'd fake
a shark attack.

125
00:05:35,671 --> 00:05:37,487
How do you fake
a shark attack?

126
00:05:37,489 --> 00:05:40,490
I don't know. Ask Alan.

127
00:05:40,492 --> 00:05:42,325
Harper?

128
00:05:42,327 --> 00:05:44,261
Yeah, right here.

129
00:05:44,263 --> 00:05:46,830
Okay, well, your boyfriend's
going to be fine.

130
00:05:46,832 --> 00:05:48,382
That's great.

131
00:05:48,384 --> 00:05:49,683
Uh, he's not my...

132
00:05:49,685 --> 00:05:51,185
It's great.

133
00:05:52,003 --> 00:05:53,637
It was the form.
It was just easier.

134
00:05:53,639 --> 00:05:57,391
Um, did he actually
have a heart attack?

135
00:05:57,393 --> 00:06:00,110
It was a mild one, but yes.
Told you.

136
00:06:01,095 --> 00:06:02,896
He should be fine.
He's just going to need rest

137
00:06:02,898 --> 00:06:04,148
and as little stress
as possible.

138
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:05,816
For how long?

139
00:06:05,818 --> 00:06:07,701
I don't know,
at least a month or two.

140
00:06:07,703 --> 00:06:09,703
Great...

141
00:06:09,705 --> 00:06:12,206
That's why we gave up women.
Am I right?

142
00:06:13,825 --> 00:06:15,225
It's a compelling argument.

143
00:06:22,650 --> 00:06:24,034
Hi.

144
00:06:24,036 --> 00:06:26,503
Hi, Walden.

145
00:06:26,505 --> 00:06:28,138
How ya feelin'?

146
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:30,574
Fan-tastic.

147
00:06:30,576 --> 00:06:33,093
I'm on a morphine drip.

148
00:06:35,046 --> 00:06:39,216
Everyone should have
a morphine drip.

149
00:06:39,218 --> 00:06:42,219
There would be no more war.

150
00:06:42,221 --> 00:06:44,738
Listen, the doctor said

151
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:48,025
that you... had
a little heart attack,

152
00:06:48,027 --> 00:06:49,493
but you're going to be fine.

153
00:06:49,495 --> 00:06:51,962
Oh, yeah.

154
00:06:51,964 --> 00:06:53,997
Yeah, I remember now.

155
00:06:53,999 --> 00:06:56,283
Zoey's moving in and...

156
00:06:56,285 --> 00:06:58,568
I'm... I'm moving out.

157
00:07:01,906 --> 00:07:03,740
No, you're not moving out.

158
00:07:03,742 --> 00:07:05,375
I'm-I'm not?

159
00:07:05,377 --> 00:07:08,745
No, you can stay as long as you
want. As long as you need.

160
00:07:08,747 --> 00:07:10,180
Oh.

161
00:07:13,302 --> 00:07:16,103
Oh, that's...
that's so good to hear.

162
00:07:16,105 --> 00:07:18,605
Thataboy.

163
00:07:18,607 --> 00:07:22,109
I just... I just want you
to not worry about anything.

164
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:23,110
I won't.

165
00:07:23,112 --> 00:07:24,761
Okay.

166
00:07:24,763 --> 00:07:26,763
You just relax
and feel better, okay?

167
00:07:26,765 --> 00:07:28,732
Okeydokey.

168
00:07:31,269 --> 00:07:33,270
Hey, Walden. Guess what?

169
00:07:33,272 --> 00:07:34,437
What?

170
00:07:34,439 --> 00:07:38,225
I'm peeing right now.

171
00:07:38,227 --> 00:07:39,860
No kidding.

172
00:07:39,862 --> 00:07:41,778
But it's okay.

173
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:46,333
There's a tube
attached to my wiener.

174
00:07:50,255 --> 00:07:52,439
I don't think there is.

175
00:07:55,727 --> 00:07:57,961
Oh...

176
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:00,480
Men...

177
00:08:00,482 --> 00:08:03,433
- My God. He's going to be okay?
- Yeah.

178
00:08:03,435 --> 00:08:05,018
He just needs
to take it easy.

179
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:06,937
I don't know
what I would do

180
00:08:06,939 --> 00:08:08,471
if anything
happened to him.

181
00:08:10,859 --> 00:08:13,026
I've already lost my good son!

182
00:08:16,114 --> 00:08:18,749
Do you happen to know
if they validate parking?

183
00:08:22,153 --> 00:08:24,087
So, are those tubes
putting stuff in

184
00:08:24,089 --> 00:08:25,339
or taking stuff out?

185
00:08:25,341 --> 00:08:27,324
I think
a little bit of both.

186
00:08:27,326 --> 00:08:28,759
Oh, I get it.

187
00:08:28,761 --> 00:08:31,762
It's like eating
on the toilet.

188
00:08:31,764 --> 00:08:33,480
So, what did the doctor say?

189
00:08:33,482 --> 00:08:35,766
Uh, he just said
he needs to take it easy.

190
00:08:35,768 --> 00:08:36,934
You know, no stress.

191
00:08:36,936 --> 00:08:38,535
Then I guess
we shouldn't tell him

192
00:08:38,537 --> 00:08:39,703
about what happened
at school.

193
00:08:39,705 --> 00:08:42,439
No, we definitely
should not.

194
00:08:42,441 --> 00:08:45,342
Honest to God, someone
put that pot in my locker.

195
00:08:47,078 --> 00:08:48,395
Why would they do that?

196
00:08:48,397 --> 00:08:52,082
That, my friend,
is the million-dollar question.

197
00:08:55,536 --> 00:08:56,653
Look, Lyndsey,

198
00:08:56,655 --> 00:08:57,955
I know you're his girlfriend,

199
00:08:57,957 --> 00:09:00,257
and I know you'd like
to take care of him, but...

200
00:09:00,259 --> 00:09:02,759
I kind of feel
responsible for this.

201
00:09:02,761 --> 00:09:05,579
And I'd like him to stay
with me until he recovers.

202
00:09:05,581 --> 00:09:07,714
Fine. Let's go
get some coffee.

203
00:09:12,337 --> 00:09:14,204
Men...

204
00:09:15,039 --> 00:09:16,390
Wake up, Alan.

205
00:09:19,044 --> 00:09:23,046
Is it spongebath time again?

206
00:09:23,048 --> 00:09:25,315
You wish.

207
00:09:31,105 --> 00:09:32,606
What's going on?

208
00:09:32,608 --> 00:09:33,723
Who are you?

209
00:09:33,725 --> 00:09:36,193
Ah, Alan, that hurts.

210
00:09:36,195 --> 00:09:38,578
Don't you recognize
your own brother?

211
00:09:46,859 --> 00:09:48,176
Men...

212
00:09:48,178 --> 00:09:49,961
What is this,
some kind of sick joke?

213
00:09:49,963 --> 00:09:51,713
Charlie's dead.

214
00:09:51,715 --> 00:09:55,067
You're dubious. Understandable.

215
00:09:55,069 --> 00:09:56,635
When you were 14 years old,

216
00:09:56,637 --> 00:09:58,503
you went to your first
boy/girl party,

217
00:09:58,505 --> 00:09:59,688
and you were really nervous

218
00:09:59,690 --> 00:10:01,139
because they were going to play
spin the bottle.

219
00:10:01,141 --> 00:10:01,973
Yeah?

220
00:10:01,975 --> 00:10:03,408
So, before you left the house,

221
00:10:03,410 --> 00:10:05,944
I convinced you that
the grownup way to French-kiss

222
00:10:05,946 --> 00:10:08,080
was to spit in the
other person's mouth.

223
00:10:09,866 --> 00:10:12,534
You hocked a big loogie
down Marcy Bilson's throat

224
00:10:12,536 --> 00:10:14,419
and she'd kicked you
in the nuts.

225
00:10:14,421 --> 00:10:17,656
Ah, come on, everybody in
high school knew that story.

226
00:10:17,658 --> 00:10:19,541
Answer me this:

227
00:10:19,543 --> 00:10:22,377
What are your five favorite
words to hear from a woman?

228
00:10:22,379 --> 00:10:25,814
"I can't spend the night."

229
00:10:26,516 --> 00:10:28,517
Charlie...

230
00:10:28,519 --> 00:10:30,835
At your service.

231
00:10:30,837 --> 00:10:33,005
I don't...
I don't understand.

232
00:10:33,007 --> 00:10:35,507
Are you reincarnated
or something?

233
00:10:35,509 --> 00:10:37,526
Nah, I'm in hell.

234
00:10:40,029 --> 00:10:42,481
Walking around
in this old broad's body

235
00:10:42,483 --> 00:10:45,684
is supposed to be some kind
of eternal damnation.

236
00:10:46,953 --> 00:10:47,869
You know what?

237
00:10:47,871 --> 00:10:49,621
The joke's on them.

238
00:10:49,623 --> 00:10:52,157
Boobs are still boobs.

239
00:10:54,661 --> 00:10:56,161
So, why are you here?

240
00:10:56,163 --> 00:10:57,746
I thought you could use
a little help.

241
00:10:57,748 --> 00:10:59,348
I have been through
a rough patch.

242
00:10:59,350 --> 00:11:01,850
You look like you've been
through a propeller.

243
00:11:03,119 --> 00:11:05,203
I came here to tell you
it's not too late

244
00:11:05,205 --> 00:11:06,221
to turn your life around.

245
00:11:06,223 --> 00:11:07,039
How?

246
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:08,724
Stop being a parasite.

247
00:11:08,726 --> 00:11:11,510
Step up. Be a man.
Grow a pair.

248
00:11:12,578 --> 00:11:15,714
Uh, parenthetically,
this body actually has a pair.

249
00:11:17,066 --> 00:11:19,484
They dangle
right under my hooha.

250
00:11:22,555 --> 00:11:25,190
Did not need to know that.

251
00:11:25,192 --> 00:11:28,026
Point being, you lived on me
for eight years

252
00:11:28,028 --> 00:11:29,778
and now you're
living off this new guy.

253
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:31,730
Now, now, hang on.
W-Walden's my friend.

254
00:11:31,732 --> 00:11:33,448
He invited me
to stay with him.

255
00:11:33,450 --> 00:11:36,401
Oh, kiss my
surprisingly tight ass.

256
00:11:36,403 --> 00:11:38,670
You're nobody's friend.

257
00:11:38,672 --> 00:11:41,623
You're a useless appendage,
like tonsils,

258
00:11:41,625 --> 00:11:45,010
or the nutsack
under my hooha.

259
00:11:45,012 --> 00:11:48,463
I see hell hasn't
mellowed you out any.

260
00:11:48,465 --> 00:11:50,182
Listen to me,
you got to get out

261
00:11:50,184 --> 00:11:52,601
of that guy's house
and make a life for yourself.

262
00:11:52,603 --> 00:11:54,436
I suppose I could go
live with Lyndsey.

263
00:11:54,438 --> 00:11:56,087
You're missing my point.

264
00:11:56,089 --> 00:11:58,106
I'm not suggesting
that the tapeworm

265
00:11:58,108 --> 00:12:00,559
find a new colon
to crawl into.

266
00:12:01,728 --> 00:12:03,295
Hold out your hand.

267
00:12:05,064 --> 00:12:06,948
Thank you.

268
00:12:08,618 --> 00:12:10,101
This is your last chance, Alan.

269
00:12:10,103 --> 00:12:12,070
Move out of that house.
Get your own place.

270
00:12:12,072 --> 00:12:13,789
Start pulling your own weight
in the world.

271
00:12:13,791 --> 00:12:15,457
Okay. I will.

272
00:12:15,459 --> 00:12:17,376
You'll see.
I can change.

273
00:12:17,378 --> 00:12:18,877
Good.

274
00:12:18,879 --> 00:12:20,445
Then my work here is done.

275
00:12:20,447 --> 00:12:22,280
Well, thanks, Charlie.

276
00:12:22,282 --> 00:12:23,799
You got it.

277
00:12:23,801 --> 00:12:27,285
Oh, uh,

278
00:12:27,287 --> 00:12:28,470
Before I go...

279
00:12:29,389 --> 00:12:30,955
you gotta check this out.

280
00:12:31,674 --> 00:12:32,557
Oh!

281
00:12:32,559 --> 00:12:34,125
Oh!

282
00:12:34,127 --> 00:12:35,794
Was I lying?

283
00:12:35,796 --> 00:12:38,163
Tell me that's not disturbing.

284
00:12:45,805 --> 00:12:47,806
Men...

285
00:12:47,808 --> 00:12:49,441
What do you want me
to do, Zoey?

286
00:12:49,443 --> 00:12:52,077
The last time I asked him
to leave, he almost died.

287
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:53,278
Well, what does that mean?

288
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:55,497
He lives with you
until he actually does die?

289
00:12:55,499 --> 00:12:58,116
No, just until he
gets back on his feet.

290
00:12:58,118 --> 00:13:00,168
The man has no feet.

291
00:13:00,170 --> 00:13:02,087
He is a footless man.

292
00:13:02,089 --> 00:13:03,755
Okay, come on.

293
00:13:03,757 --> 00:13:06,425
What about his mother?
Why doesn't he live with her?

294
00:13:06,427 --> 00:13:07,626
They don't really get along.

295
00:13:07,628 --> 00:13:09,211
What about his girlfriend?

296
00:13:09,213 --> 00:13:11,329
They don't really get along.

297
00:13:11,331 --> 00:13:12,798
Oh, God.

298
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,466
So we're stuck with him forever.

299
00:13:14,468 --> 00:13:18,637
The man is the herpes
of houseguests.

300
00:13:20,057 --> 00:13:21,623
Come on.
That is not fair.

301
00:13:21,625 --> 00:13:22,691
You're right.

302
00:13:22,693 --> 00:13:25,026
Herpes sometimes disappears
for a while.

303
00:13:26,562 --> 00:13:27,946
Surprise!

304
00:13:27,948 --> 00:13:28,980
Alan.

305
00:13:28,982 --> 00:13:30,982
Herpes.

306
00:13:30,984 --> 00:13:32,350
What? They let you out?

307
00:13:32,352 --> 00:13:34,185
Oh, no, no.
I checked myself out.

308
00:13:34,187 --> 00:13:35,971
I didn't want you to have
to pay one more penny for me.

309
00:13:35,973 --> 00:13:37,021
Oh, come on.

310
00:13:37,023 --> 00:13:38,189
The money is not important.

311
00:13:38,191 --> 00:13:39,541
What's important
is your health.

312
00:13:39,543 --> 00:13:41,576
No, what's important
is that I stop being a parasite

313
00:13:41,578 --> 00:13:42,744
and stand on my own two feet.

314
00:13:42,746 --> 00:13:44,546
You have no feet.

315
00:13:45,915 --> 00:13:47,332
What was that?

316
00:13:47,334 --> 00:13:48,416
It's Zoey.

317
00:13:48,418 --> 00:13:50,368
I'll be right there, honey.

318
00:13:50,370 --> 00:13:53,255
I'm just going to grab my stuff,
and I'll get out of your hair.

319
00:13:53,257 --> 00:13:54,489
Are you sure?

320
00:13:54,491 --> 00:13:56,925
I am positive, Walden.
I-I have had an epiphany.

321
00:13:56,927 --> 00:13:59,060
I need to make a big change
in my life.

322
00:13:59,062 --> 00:14:00,896
Wow.

323
00:14:00,898 --> 00:14:02,063
Where will you go?

324
00:14:02,065 --> 00:14:03,982
Oh, I found a cute little place
online.

325
00:14:03,984 --> 00:14:05,317
Uh, you know, it's not much,

326
00:14:05,319 --> 00:14:07,435
but, uh, at least
I'll have my pride.

327
00:14:07,437 --> 00:14:08,904
I don't know, Alan.

328
00:14:08,906 --> 00:14:12,390
Let the man have his pride!

329
00:14:12,392 --> 00:14:15,911
Uh, here's my address
for mailing stuff.

330
00:14:17,330 --> 00:14:18,864
If this is what you want...

331
00:14:18,866 --> 00:14:19,664
It's what I want.

332
00:14:19,666 --> 00:14:21,366
It's what everybody wants!

333
00:14:23,252 --> 00:14:24,569
Don't listen to her.

334
00:14:24,571 --> 00:14:26,838
Oh, no, no.
She's right.

335
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:29,958
She's an angry,
cold-hearted tea bag!

336
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:32,594
But she's right.

337
00:14:32,596 --> 00:14:34,963
What did he say?

338
00:14:34,965 --> 00:14:37,299
He said that you were right.

339
00:14:39,268 --> 00:14:41,052
Men...

340
00:14:43,021 --> 00:14:44,188
No, Jake.

341
00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:45,623
If I'm not living
at the beach house,

342
00:14:45,625 --> 00:14:47,325
you're not living
at the beach house.

343
00:14:47,327 --> 00:14:50,211
Yeah, well, sometimes
life just isn't fair.

344
00:14:50,213 --> 00:14:53,548
Well, sure you can visit me
where I'm living now.

345
00:14:53,550 --> 00:14:55,633
But, uh, you're not going
to have your own room

346
00:14:55,635 --> 00:14:57,701
or your own bed
or your own bathroom

347
00:14:57,703 --> 00:15:00,371
and... you might need
to have a tetanus shot.

348
00:15:02,841 --> 00:15:05,026
But I'd love to have you.

349
00:15:05,028 --> 00:15:07,228
Okay, you let me know.

350
00:15:07,230 --> 00:15:10,064
Okay, good night.

351
00:15:14,186 --> 00:15:15,886
All right.

352
00:15:15,888 --> 00:15:17,939
It's not much, but...

353
00:15:17,941 --> 00:15:19,157
it's mine.

354
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,578
I am self-sufficient.

355
00:15:26,031 --> 00:15:28,950
And beholden to no one.

356
00:15:36,509 --> 00:15:39,510
Oh, that's not a good sign.

357
00:15:42,348 --> 00:15:44,182
Men...

358
00:15:45,133 --> 00:15:46,634
It's odd...

359
00:15:46,636 --> 00:15:48,252
But now that
Alan's finally gone,

360
00:15:48,254 --> 00:15:49,971
I actually kind of miss him.

361
00:15:49,973 --> 00:15:51,305
Yeah, me too.

362
00:15:51,307 --> 00:15:52,773
Walden, I'm kidding.

363
00:15:54,426 --> 00:15:55,426
Oh, yeah, me too.

364
00:15:59,398 --> 00:16:00,815
So...

365
00:16:00,817 --> 00:16:02,950
Now that we have the house
to ourselves,

366
00:16:02,952 --> 00:16:04,151
what would you like to do?

367
00:16:04,153 --> 00:16:06,120
What I would like to do

368
00:16:06,122 --> 00:16:08,172
is you.

369
00:16:09,625 --> 00:16:11,292
And where I would like to do it,

370
00:16:11,294 --> 00:16:13,377
is on every flat surface

371
00:16:13,379 --> 00:16:15,613
in every room of this house.

372
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:17,548
Mm.
Mm.

373
00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:19,116
Woo. Hey.

374
00:16:19,118 --> 00:16:21,619
Oh. Jake.

375
00:16:21,621 --> 00:16:22,553
This is my friend, Gabby.

376
00:16:22,555 --> 00:16:25,456
Hi!

377
00:16:25,458 --> 00:16:27,425
We're going to go hang out
in my room.

378
00:16:27,427 --> 00:16:29,093
Uh, Jake, uh,

379
00:16:29,095 --> 00:16:30,595
hold on.

380
00:16:30,597 --> 00:16:32,963
Have you spoken
to your father lately?

381
00:16:32,965 --> 00:16:35,466
No, I don't believe I have.

382
00:16:38,186 --> 00:16:39,487
Look at the bright side.

383
00:16:39,489 --> 00:16:40,938
What bright side?

384
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:44,075
He might share some
of his pot with us.

385
00:16:45,410 --> 00:16:47,945
Men...

386
00:16:50,916 --> 00:16:53,851
Wake up, buttercup.

387
00:16:55,654 --> 00:16:58,372
Oh. Hey, Charlie.

388
00:16:59,758 --> 00:17:02,960
So, what do you think?

389
00:17:02,962 --> 00:17:04,929
I finally got my own place.

390
00:17:04,931 --> 00:17:06,847
Fantastic.

391
00:17:06,849 --> 00:17:09,317
You're not sponging off
that rat, are you?

392
00:17:10,969 --> 00:17:11,936
There's a rat?

393
00:17:11,938 --> 00:17:13,104
Nah, I'm just kiddin'.

394
00:17:13,106 --> 00:17:15,839
He's dead.

395
00:17:15,841 --> 00:17:19,343
But aren't you proud of me?
I mean, I did what you said.

396
00:17:19,345 --> 00:17:21,145
I'm standing
on my own two feet.

397
00:17:21,147 --> 00:17:24,031
Yeah.

398
00:17:24,033 --> 00:17:25,466
Sucker.

399
00:17:27,536 --> 00:17:28,786
What?

400
00:17:28,788 --> 00:17:30,871
I had to come back
from hell to do it,

401
00:17:30,873 --> 00:17:34,208
but I finally gotcha
out of my freakin' house!

402
00:17:35,577 --> 00:17:38,212
But I-I-I thought you wanted me
to be a better person.

403
00:17:38,214 --> 00:17:40,164
Nope.

404
00:17:40,166 --> 00:17:42,366
What? So you were just
screwing with me?

405
00:17:42,368 --> 00:17:44,034
Yep.

406
00:17:44,036 --> 00:17:45,869
Why?

407
00:17:45,871 --> 00:17:50,141
I'm in hell, Alan.
That's kind of what we do.

408
00:17:50,143 --> 00:17:51,892
Whoa!

409
00:17:51,894 --> 00:17:54,312
What a horrible dream.

410
00:17:54,314 --> 00:17:57,231
What's so horrible about it?

411
00:18:00,103 --> 00:18:02,886
Boo-boo-boo-boo-boo-boo.

412
00:18:02,888 --> 00:18:05,189
Still here.

413
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:10,194
I can do this aaalll night.

414
00:18:14,065 --> 00:18:16,367
Men...

415
00:18:18,870 --> 00:18:20,921
Okay.

416
00:18:22,073 --> 00:18:25,760
How do we sell this?
Uh...

417
00:18:29,765 --> 00:18:31,465
911...

418
00:18:31,467 --> 00:18:33,417
911!

419
00:18:33,419 --> 00:18:36,604
Come on. You can
do better than that. Uh...

420
00:18:36,606 --> 00:18:37,938
Ah...

421
00:18:42,194 --> 00:18:44,428
Help me.

422
00:18:44,430 --> 00:18:45,696
Call 911.

423
00:18:46,566 --> 00:18:49,400
Am I dying
or taking a dump?

424
00:18:52,371 --> 00:18:53,954
Ah.

425
00:18:55,707 --> 00:18:59,210
Call 911...
Call 911...

426
00:18:59,212 --> 00:19:00,878
Yeah, that's it. Okay.

427
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:04,114
Showtime.

428
00:19:07,469 --> 00:19:08,836
Alan...

429
00:19:08,838 --> 00:19:10,471
Don't, don't worry.
I'm not moving back in.

430
00:19:10,473 --> 00:19:12,089
I just forgot a few things.

431
00:19:12,091 --> 00:19:13,307
Yeah, like your son?

432
00:19:13,309 --> 00:19:15,493
Wait. Jake's here?

433
00:19:15,495 --> 00:19:16,894
Yeah, and his girlfriend.

434
00:19:16,896 --> 00:19:19,263
Ah, you know,
damn that kid.

435
00:19:19,265 --> 00:19:22,466
I told him I was moving out and
he was not to come back here.

436
00:19:22,468 --> 00:19:24,718
But does he listen to me? No.

437
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:27,822
You know, no one ever
listens to me and I...

438
00:19:31,026 --> 00:19:32,243
Call 911.

439
00:19:32,245 --> 00:19:33,944
Call 911.
Oh, no, not again.

440
00:19:33,946 --> 00:19:35,496
Hold on.
I'll get help.

441
00:19:37,499 --> 00:19:39,300
Son of a bitch.

442
00:19:40,869 --> 00:19:43,654
What's the matter?
Couldn't find a shark?

443
00:19:49,082 --> 00:19:50,516
Men...

444
00:19:50,518 --> 00:19:51,851
So, what do you think, Doc?

445
00:19:51,853 --> 00:19:53,919
We won't know until
we get all the tests back,

446
00:19:53,921 --> 00:19:56,005
but right now, his heart
appears to be perfectly fine.

447
00:19:56,007 --> 00:19:57,707
Thank God.

448
00:19:57,709 --> 00:19:59,226
So how long before
I can take him home?

449
00:19:59,251 --> 00:20:00,193
Walden?

450
00:20:00,194 --> 00:20:02,644
I am sorry, Zoey,
but I am not going to have

451
00:20:02,646 --> 00:20:04,914
this man's death
on my conscience.

452
00:20:10,454 --> 00:20:12,371
I'd like to thank the Academy.

453
00:20:15,709 --> 00:20:18,327
There are no small parts...

454
00:20:18,329 --> 00:20:20,262
only small apartments.

455
00:20:29,222 --> 00:20:31,273
I don't think you're allowed
to smoke in here.

456
00:20:31,275 --> 00:20:34,527
Does that include the joint
you just blew in the bathroom?

457
00:20:34,529 --> 00:20:36,612
How'd you know about that?

458
00:20:36,614 --> 00:20:38,948
Call it women's intuition,
taterhead.

459
00:20:38,950 --> 00:20:41,534
Whoa, the only person
that ever called me "taterhead"

460
00:20:41,536 --> 00:20:42,851
was my uncle Charlie.

461
00:20:42,853 --> 00:20:45,888
So, what does that
tell ya?

462
00:20:47,157 --> 00:20:48,857
I have no idea.

463
00:20:48,859 --> 00:20:52,361
Screw it.
I'm going back to hell.

464
00:20:55,298 --> 00:20:56,749
Ready, ladies?

465
00:20:56,751 --> 00:20:58,300
You bet.
We are.

466
00:20:58,302 --> 00:21:00,702
Then let's go.

467
00:21:00,704 --> 00:21:04,090
And me with with just a nutsack.
