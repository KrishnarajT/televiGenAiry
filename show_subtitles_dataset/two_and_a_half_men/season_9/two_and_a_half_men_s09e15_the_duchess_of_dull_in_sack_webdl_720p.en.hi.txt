Walden.

4
00:00:13,489 --> 00:00:15,098
Wake up.
You have to go.

5
00:00:15,098 --> 00:00:16,143
What?

6
00:00:16,143 --> 00:00:17,586
My daughter's going
to be up soon.

7
00:00:17,586 --> 00:00:20,272
I don't want her to
find you in here.

8
00:00:20,272 --> 00:00:21,947
Okay...

9
00:00:21,947 --> 00:00:23,358
I'm awake.

10
00:00:23,358 --> 00:00:25,348
Now get dressed.

00:00:25,348 --> 00:00:26,758
All right.

00:00:26,758 --> 00:00:28,897
Um... before I go,

13
00:00:28,897 --> 00:00:31,684
I do have that
morning phenomenon

14
00:00:31,684 --> 00:00:33,342
that sometimes
happens to fellas.

15
00:00:33,342 --> 00:00:35,167
You know,
in the morning.

16
00:00:35,167 --> 00:00:37,853
I don't care about
your erection, okay?

17
00:00:37,853 --> 00:00:39,860
Okay, fine, fine.

18
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:42,497
I just thought
that I would point it out

19
00:00:42,497 --> 00:00:44,156
since it is...

20
00:00:44,156 --> 00:00:46,478
you know, pointing out.

21
00:00:46,478 --> 00:00:48,302
Very impressive.

22
00:00:48,302 --> 00:00:51,620
Now, skedaddle before
Ava wakes up, okay?

23
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:53,958
You know, at some point,
I'm going to have to meet her.

24
00:00:53,958 --> 00:00:56,563
At some point, yes,
but not today.

25
00:00:56,563 --> 00:00:59,083
Yeah, well, I kind of feel
like I already know her.

26
00:00:59,083 --> 00:01:00,708
I mean, I'm certainly familiar

27
00:01:00,708 --> 00:01:03,661
with her port of entry
into this world.

28
00:01:05,055 --> 00:01:06,729
Yes. Ha ha.

29
00:01:06,729 --> 00:01:08,056
Now, get out.

30
00:01:08,056 --> 00:01:08,772
Mummy?

31
00:01:11,492 --> 00:01:12,866
Uh... closet!

32
00:01:12,866 --> 00:01:15,022
Really? The closet?
Isn't that kind of cliché?

33
00:01:15,022 --> 00:01:16,498
Oh, God. In!

34
00:01:18,373 --> 00:01:20,097
I want to snuggle.

35
00:01:20,097 --> 00:01:21,325
Good idea!

36
00:01:21,325 --> 00:01:23,348
Let's snuggle in your room.

37
00:01:23,348 --> 00:01:25,256
No, here.

38
00:01:26,119 --> 00:01:27,412
Here. Of course.

39
00:01:27,412 --> 00:01:29,600
Um, good.

40
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,143
Now, close your eyes,

41
00:01:31,143 --> 00:01:32,885
and Mummy will give you
a super-duper snuggle.

42
00:01:32,885 --> 00:01:33,880
Mwah!

43
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:35,505
Are your eyes closed?

44
00:01:35,505 --> 00:01:36,617
Uh-huh.

45
00:01:36,617 --> 00:01:38,856
Are Winston's eyes closed?

46
00:01:38,856 --> 00:01:40,879
He's not real, Mummy.

47
00:01:40,879 --> 00:01:43,201
All righty.

48
00:01:43,201 --> 00:01:45,522
Get out!

49
00:01:53,287 --> 00:01:54,313
All done.

00:01:54,313 --> 00:01:56,469
Now, what do you say

51
00:01:56,469 --> 00:01:58,426
we make some pancakes?

00:01:58,426 --> 00:01:59,786
Yay!

00:02:03,535 --> 00:02:04,978

00:02:04,978 --> 00:02:08,410
- Pancakes! Pancakes!
- Pancakes! Pancakes!

56
00:02:10,668 --> 00:02:13,470
I like pancakes.

57
00:02:14,317 --> 00:02:17,334
I left Winston
on your bed.

58
00:02:32,131 --> 00:02:35,578

63
00:03:00,892 --> 00:03:03,546
Does it involve money,
drugs or pregnancy?

No.

65
00:03:04,674 --> 00:03:07,411
How can I help you, my son?

66
00:03:07,411 --> 00:03:09,650
You and Eldridge's mom
are dating again, right?

67
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:12,336
Right.
You think you'll ever get married?

68
00:03:12,336 --> 00:03:14,012
Uh, well, actually,
we talked about that

69
00:03:14,012 --> 00:03:15,753
and decided the only
reason to do it

70
00:03:15,753 --> 00:03:17,743
would be if we wanted
to have more kids,

71
00:03:17,743 --> 00:03:19,568
and since we both...

72
00:03:25,623 --> 00:03:29,270
had so much success
the first time,

73
00:03:29,270 --> 00:03:31,260
there's really no point.

74
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:32,289
Oh.

75
00:03:32,289 --> 00:03:33,782
What brought that up?

76
00:03:33,782 --> 00:03:35,888
Oh. Me and Eldridge
were thinking

77
00:03:35,888 --> 00:03:37,729
it would be cool if
we were brothers,

78
00:03:37,729 --> 00:03:40,831
so that we could switch
places to fool people.

79
00:03:40,831 --> 00:03:42,871
That only works
if you're twins, Jake.

80
00:03:42,871 --> 00:03:45,276
How do you know
for sure I'm Jake?

81
00:03:48,544 --> 00:03:49,952
Morning.
Morning.

82
00:03:49,952 --> 00:03:51,197
What happened to you?

83
00:03:51,197 --> 00:03:55,393
I was perched on a dresser,
and I fell on my penis.

84
00:03:55,393 --> 00:03:58,129
Oh. I hate when
that happens.

85
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:02,060
Uh... uh, dare I ask?

86
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:04,432
Uh, yeah, I was hiding
from Zoey's daughter.

87
00:04:04,432 --> 00:04:06,066
Oh. Still doesn't want you
to meet her?

88
00:04:06,066 --> 00:04:07,284
No.

89
00:04:07,284 --> 00:04:08,993
Well, it's not unusual
for single moms

90
00:04:08,993 --> 00:04:10,270
to be protective of their kids.

91
00:04:10,270 --> 00:04:12,210
And then, when you are
introduced to them,

92
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:14,748
you're "Uncle Alan, who's on
his way back to Cleveland,

93
00:04:14,748 --> 00:04:16,540
"and you don't have
to remember his name

94
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:19,260
because you'll never,
ever see him again."

95
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:22,709
What do you do to women
to piss them off so much?

96
00:04:22,709 --> 00:04:25,810
If I knew,
don't you think I'd stop?

97
00:04:26,890 --> 00:04:28,149
Well, the daughter stuff

98
00:04:28,149 --> 00:04:30,140
isn't the only thing
bothering me about Zoey.

99
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:31,998
Oh, I thought you guys
were getting along great.

100
00:04:31,998 --> 00:04:33,540
Well, we are...
most of the time.

101
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:35,098
It's just...

102
00:04:36,029 --> 00:04:37,803
Have you ever been
in a relationship

103
00:04:37,803 --> 00:04:39,742
where you're really
into each other,

104
00:04:39,742 --> 00:04:41,700
but the sex
isn't everything it could be?

105
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:42,994
Oh, sure.

106
00:04:42,994 --> 00:04:46,377
Uh, except for the
"really into each other" part.

107
00:04:46,377 --> 00:04:48,168
It's not that the sex is bad,
Mm-hmm.

108
00:04:48,168 --> 00:04:49,528
it's just that...

109
00:04:49,528 --> 00:04:52,149
lately, it seems like she
could just take it or leave it.

110
00:04:52,149 --> 00:04:53,940
Oh... "Take it or leave it."

111
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:56,013
Boy, I know that song.

112
00:04:56,013 --> 00:04:57,539
But my philosophy is,

113
00:04:57,539 --> 00:05:00,359
as long as she's taking it,
I'm not leaving.

114
00:05:00,359 --> 00:05:03,012
You know what she said to me
last night, after we had sex?

115
00:05:03,012 --> 00:05:04,173
"That was nice.

116
00:05:04,173 --> 00:05:05,882
Now let's do something fun."

117
00:05:07,442 --> 00:05:09,199
Well, I suppose
that's better than,

118
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:13,080
"Put your pants on so we can get
back to the family reunion."

119
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:14,838
You're kidding, right?

120
00:05:14,838 --> 00:05:18,271
Oh, she was just
a cousin by marriage.

121
00:05:18,271 --> 00:05:21,340
So have you actually talked
to Zoey about your problem?

122
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:23,579
No. I was just hoping
it would just get better.

123
00:05:23,579 --> 00:05:25,486
Oh, no, no, no. Take it from me.

124
00:05:25,486 --> 00:05:27,277
There are two things
in long-term relationships

125
00:05:27,277 --> 00:05:28,853
that never get better
by themselves.

126
00:05:28,853 --> 00:05:30,180
One is sex.

127
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:31,955
What's the other one?

128
00:05:31,955 --> 00:05:33,132
Does it matter?

129
00:05:37,097 --> 00:05:38,722
It's all arranged.

130
00:05:38,722 --> 00:05:40,579
Ava's going to be
spending tonight with her dad.

131
00:05:40,579 --> 00:05:41,790
Great.

132
00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:43,266
So sleepover at my house?

133
00:05:43,266 --> 00:05:44,643
Sounds heavenly.

134
00:05:44,643 --> 00:05:47,014
Although I don't know
how much sleeping we'll do.

135
00:05:47,014 --> 00:05:48,905
Cheeky monkey.

136
00:05:48,905 --> 00:05:50,696
Shall I bring around
some Chinese?

137
00:05:50,696 --> 00:05:51,774
Hey, the more, the merrier.

138
00:05:51,774 --> 00:05:53,930
Ha, ha.

139
00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:57,297
You know, if there's
anything I can do

140
00:05:57,297 --> 00:06:00,697
to, you know,
make you happier...

141
00:06:00,697 --> 00:06:02,638
What on Earth
are you talking about?

142
00:06:02,638 --> 00:06:05,541
I just... I couldn't help
but notice...

143
00:06:06,786 --> 00:06:08,277
I can't even say it.

144
00:06:08,277 --> 00:06:09,621
Come on, Walden.

145
00:06:09,621 --> 00:06:11,063
You can tell me anything.

146
00:06:11,063 --> 00:06:13,087
All right.

147
00:06:14,382 --> 00:06:15,708
The sex.

148
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:17,781
You don't... you don't seem
to be enjoying the sex.

149
00:06:17,781 --> 00:06:19,024
Okay, I can't talk about that.

150
00:06:19,024 --> 00:06:21,379
Okay, y-you said we could talk
about anything.

151
00:06:21,379 --> 00:06:22,739
Yeah, but not about that.

152
00:06:22,739 --> 00:06:25,062
And certainly not on a computer.

153
00:06:25,062 --> 00:06:26,554
Why? Nobody's listening.

154
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:30,717
I'm sorry.

155
00:06:30,717 --> 00:06:33,686
I'm-I'm very uncomfortable
talking about...

156
00:06:33,686 --> 00:06:35,693
you know...

157
00:06:35,693 --> 00:06:37,003
No offense, but you don't seem

158
00:06:37,003 --> 00:06:38,662
that comfortable
doing it, either.

159
00:06:38,662 --> 00:06:40,586
You're still talking about it.

160
00:06:40,586 --> 00:06:42,029
I-I-I mean,
because if you're not,

161
00:06:42,029 --> 00:06:44,317
I mean, there are...
there are things that we can do.

162
00:06:44,317 --> 00:06:45,645
There are things we can try.

163
00:06:45,645 --> 00:06:47,386
Like?

164
00:06:47,386 --> 00:06:50,869
I don't know,
like role-playing.

165
00:06:50,869 --> 00:06:53,224
Role-playing?

166
00:06:53,224 --> 00:06:54,601
Yeah. You know...

167
00:06:54,601 --> 00:06:57,669
"Hey, lady,
I'm here to clean the pool."

168
00:06:58,533 --> 00:07:00,323
But I don't have a pool.

169
00:07:00,323 --> 00:07:01,981
No, it's an imaginary pool.

170
00:07:01,981 --> 00:07:05,083
How is you
cleaning an imaginary pool

171
00:07:05,083 --> 00:07:06,210
supposed to be erotic?

172
00:07:06,210 --> 00:07:08,151
Okay, okay,
just forget the pool.

173
00:07:08,151 --> 00:07:09,677
I... all I'm saying is-is that,

174
00:07:09,677 --> 00:07:13,342
if there's anything I can do,
just let me know.

175
00:07:13,342 --> 00:07:15,150
Thank you for your concern,

176
00:07:15,150 --> 00:07:17,804
but I'm perfectly
satisfied with our...

177
00:07:17,804 --> 00:07:20,557
carnal interludes.

178
00:07:21,421 --> 00:07:22,747
Really?

179
00:07:22,747 --> 00:07:24,123
Carnal interludes?

180
00:07:24,123 --> 00:07:25,865
Well, what do you
want me to call it?

181
00:07:25,865 --> 00:07:27,307
It doesn't matter.
I mean, the distance

182
00:07:27,307 --> 00:07:29,381
between "carnal interludes"
and what I would call it

183
00:07:29,381 --> 00:07:31,786
isn't really susceptible
to compromise.

184
00:07:31,786 --> 00:07:33,726
All right, listen,
I have to run and take Ava

185
00:07:33,726 --> 00:07:35,484
to her father's,
so I'll see you tonight, yes?

186
00:07:35,484 --> 00:07:36,811
Great.

187
00:07:36,811 --> 00:07:39,134
Walden, believe me,

188
00:07:39,134 --> 00:07:42,035
I am fine and dandy
with our...

189
00:07:43,446 --> 00:07:45,685
Carnal interludes.

190
00:07:45,685 --> 00:07:47,791
See you.

191
00:07:47,791 --> 00:07:49,582
Everything okay

192
00:07:49,582 --> 00:07:51,523
with you and
Mary Poppins?

193
00:07:51,523 --> 00:07:52,799
Were you eavesdropping?

194
00:07:52,799 --> 00:07:54,011
If I don't eavesdrop,

195
00:07:54,011 --> 00:07:55,885
I've got nothing
to tweet about.

196
00:07:56,947 --> 00:07:58,538
The problem is she's English.

197
00:07:58,538 --> 00:08:00,777
Stiff upper lips and all that.

198
00:08:01,756 --> 00:08:04,410
You should date
a nice Polish girl.

199
00:08:04,410 --> 00:08:05,902
You don't say.

200
00:08:05,902 --> 00:08:07,063
Oh, yeah.

201
00:08:07,063 --> 00:08:09,800
Those Commies,
they're all freaks.

202
00:08:11,394 --> 00:08:12,719
Sex is the only thing

203
00:08:12,719 --> 00:08:15,125
they didn't have to stand
in line and wait for.

204
00:08:17,812 --> 00:08:19,138
Good to know.

205
00:08:19,138 --> 00:08:20,349
I think I'll stick with Zoey.

206
00:08:20,349 --> 00:08:22,289
I just wish I could
get her to relax.

207
00:08:22,289 --> 00:08:23,284
You know, let go.

208
00:08:23,284 --> 00:08:25,523
Me, I'm just the opposite.

209
00:08:25,523 --> 00:08:27,928
I can get off
leaning against the dryer

210
00:08:27,928 --> 00:08:30,283
with a couple of sneakers in it.

211
00:08:31,081 --> 00:08:33,152
Is that why my Nikes
are so clean?

212
00:08:33,152 --> 00:08:35,358
Win-win.

213
00:08:35,358 --> 00:08:39,571
Listen, if you want to loosen up
the Duchess of Dull-In-Sack,

214
00:08:39,571 --> 00:08:43,220
you might try slipping her
one of my special brownies.

215
00:08:44,233 --> 00:08:46,587
I got a fresh batch
in the fridge.

216
00:08:46,587 --> 00:08:49,523
You know, for my glaucoma.

217
00:08:53,006 --> 00:08:54,515
Thank you, but I'm...

218
00:08:54,515 --> 00:08:57,450
I don't want to have to get Zoey
loaded to enjoy sex with me.

219
00:08:57,450 --> 00:08:59,805
Suit yourself.

220
00:08:59,805 --> 00:09:01,266
Doesn't want to get her loaded.

221
00:09:01,266 --> 00:09:03,637
What's the matter
with kids today?

222
00:09:04,633 --> 00:09:06,439
♪ Men.

223
00:09:09,776 --> 00:09:11,051
Aw.

224
00:09:11,051 --> 00:09:12,742
That was a lovely movie.

225
00:09:12,742 --> 00:09:15,198
Yeah, that Hugh Grant
is really something.

226
00:09:24,486 --> 00:09:26,110
Something wrong?

227
00:09:26,110 --> 00:09:27,984
No. Why?

228
00:09:27,984 --> 00:09:29,793
Usually, at this point
in the evening,

229
00:09:29,793 --> 00:09:31,501
you start
getting frisky.

230
00:09:32,331 --> 00:09:33,806
Frisky?

231
00:09:34,636 --> 00:09:35,979
Randy.

232
00:09:35,979 --> 00:09:37,455
Randy?

233
00:09:37,455 --> 00:09:38,965
All right. "Horny."

234
00:09:38,965 --> 00:09:41,220
Made you say it.

235
00:09:43,112 --> 00:09:45,931
Is that an invitation
to get frisky?

236
00:09:45,931 --> 00:09:47,572
If you want.

237
00:09:47,572 --> 00:09:48,916
If you want.

238
00:09:48,916 --> 00:09:51,237
Well, I want
if you want.

239
00:09:51,237 --> 00:09:52,681
No, no, I want
you to want

240
00:09:52,681 --> 00:09:54,223
because you want,
not because I want.

241
00:09:54,223 --> 00:09:55,699
Okay, I've lost
the thread.

242
00:09:55,699 --> 00:09:57,657
Now, are we gonna
do this or not?

243
00:09:57,657 --> 00:09:59,647
Only if you want.

244
00:09:59,647 --> 00:10:01,504
Oh, Walden, why are you
making this so difficult?

245
00:10:01,504 --> 00:10:04,655
Because I... it's not fun for
me unless you're having fun.

246
00:10:04,655 --> 00:10:05,833
All right.

247
00:10:05,833 --> 00:10:07,990
Let's have some fun.

248
00:10:09,101 --> 00:10:10,561
Oh, look.

249
00:10:10,561 --> 00:10:12,451
It's the pool cleaning man.

250
00:10:15,105 --> 00:10:17,941
Come to clean my pool,
have you?

251
00:10:18,804 --> 00:10:21,075
Okay, that's...
that's enough.

252
00:10:21,075 --> 00:10:24,907
My, what a big chlorine bottle
you've got.

253
00:10:24,907 --> 00:10:26,151
O-Okay, please stop.

254
00:10:26,151 --> 00:10:27,312
Let's just stop.

255
00:10:27,312 --> 00:10:28,672
You sure?

256
00:10:28,672 --> 00:10:29,866
Yes.

257
00:10:29,866 --> 00:10:31,358
Oh, okay.

258
00:10:31,358 --> 00:10:33,730
We'll go
to sleep, then.

259
00:10:40,432 --> 00:10:42,604
Do you like brownies?

260
00:10:42,604 --> 00:10:43,980
What?

261
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:45,639
Is this another game?

262
00:10:45,639 --> 00:10:47,446
The sexy pastry chef.

263
00:10:47,446 --> 00:10:49,039
No. No.

264
00:10:49,039 --> 00:10:51,195
Come to butter
my baking pan, have you?

265
00:10:51,195 --> 00:10:52,439
No. No.

266
00:10:52,439 --> 00:10:54,877
No. Uh... no.

267
00:10:54,877 --> 00:10:56,088
No.
Okay.

268
00:10:56,088 --> 00:10:57,398
It's just that...

269
00:10:57,398 --> 00:11:01,013
Berta made these...
pot brownies,

270
00:11:01,013 --> 00:11:04,165
and I just thought maybe,

271
00:11:04,165 --> 00:11:07,846
if we had one, that we
could relax a little bit.

272
00:11:07,846 --> 00:11:11,545
Oh... Tried that once
at university.

273
00:11:11,545 --> 00:11:13,453
Had a bit of a giggle.

274
00:11:13,453 --> 00:11:15,610
Is that a yes?

275
00:11:15,610 --> 00:11:17,915
I don't see any harm in it.

276
00:11:17,915 --> 00:11:20,551
What was that?

277
00:11:20,551 --> 00:11:22,376
Do you hear police sirens?

278
00:11:22,376 --> 00:11:24,234
I hear police sirens.

279
00:11:26,690 --> 00:11:28,596
Dear God, they're from France!

280
00:11:31,998 --> 00:11:32,833
Bummer.

281
00:11:38,299 --> 00:11:40,288
Oh, no, they're
getting closer!

282
00:11:43,690 --> 00:11:47,006
Looks like someone else
found the brownies.

283
00:11:47,006 --> 00:11:49,162
Oh, good, you saw her, too.

284
00:11:57,388 --> 00:11:58,631
Zoey!

285
00:11:59,727 --> 00:12:01,039
Zoey! Zoey!

286
00:12:05,912 --> 00:12:09,311
Okay, she's definitely
not on the beach.

287
00:12:09,311 --> 00:12:11,533
Don't worry, man,
I'm sure she's somewhere.

288
00:12:11,533 --> 00:12:13,309
That's true.

289
00:12:13,309 --> 00:12:15,946
Everybody's somewhere.

290
00:12:15,946 --> 00:12:19,627
Whoa, that is seriously deep.

291
00:12:19,627 --> 00:12:21,320
Slice?

292
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:23,526
Ah, thank you.

293
00:12:23,526 --> 00:12:24,768
Okay.

294
00:12:25,816 --> 00:12:28,633
We got to find Zoey before
something horrible happens.

295
00:12:28,633 --> 00:12:30,823
This is very good.

296
00:12:32,234 --> 00:12:34,721
Anyway, we should split up.

297
00:12:34,721 --> 00:12:37,076
A hundred bucks
to the man who finds her.

298
00:12:37,076 --> 00:12:38,568
Hundred bucks?

299
00:12:38,568 --> 00:12:40,111
We're in.

300
00:12:40,111 --> 00:12:41,354
Cool.

301
00:12:42,601 --> 00:12:45,667
Maybe she's on the beach.

302
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:50,859
Zoey! Zoey!

303
00:12:50,859 --> 00:12:51,837
Okay.

304
00:12:51,837 --> 00:12:54,375
We have to find Zoey
before he does.

305
00:12:54,375 --> 00:12:56,149
Zoey!

306
00:12:56,149 --> 00:12:59,649
Where would you go if you were
stoned and freaking out?

307
00:12:59,649 --> 00:13:00,842
Taco Bell.

308
00:13:03,018 --> 00:13:05,123
Excellent.

309
00:13:05,123 --> 00:13:07,593
Let's go.
Zoey!

310
00:13:07,593 --> 00:13:09,733
I'm right behind you.

311
00:13:13,001 --> 00:13:16,484
Zoey! Zoey!

312
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:19,750
♪ Men.

313
00:13:23,151 --> 00:13:24,178
Mmm...

314
00:13:24,178 --> 00:13:25,174
Hello.

315
00:13:25,174 --> 00:13:26,684
Mm, hello, Alan.

316
00:13:26,684 --> 00:13:28,126
What's going on?

317
00:13:28,126 --> 00:13:29,785
Just a little snack.

318
00:13:29,785 --> 00:13:30,501
I see.

319
00:13:31,993 --> 00:13:33,434
Uh, where's Walden?

320
00:13:33,434 --> 00:13:34,462
Beats me.

321
00:13:34,462 --> 00:13:37,548
Hey, you know what's very weird?

322
00:13:37,548 --> 00:13:42,058
You Americans call these chips,
we call them crisps.

323
00:13:42,058 --> 00:13:45,077
And what we call chips,
you call...

324
00:13:45,077 --> 00:13:46,088
French fries.

325
00:13:46,088 --> 00:13:49,240
Oh, don't get me
started on the French.

326
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:50,567
Yeah.

327
00:13:50,567 --> 00:13:53,337
Um, did you have
one of Berta's brownies?

328
00:13:53,337 --> 00:13:55,460
Indeed I did.

329
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:57,035
I did indeed.

330
00:13:57,035 --> 00:13:58,860
Indeed I did a doody-deedy.

331
00:13:59,723 --> 00:14:01,330
Hey,

332
00:14:01,330 --> 00:14:02,342
where's Walden?

333
00:14:02,342 --> 00:14:03,869
We're supposed to be
having good sex.

334
00:14:03,869 --> 00:14:05,145
Oh, is that so?

335
00:14:05,145 --> 00:14:05,891
Mm.

336
00:14:06,607 --> 00:14:09,723
He thinks I don't enjoy it,
but it's just hard for me

337
00:14:09,723 --> 00:14:12,775
to give myself to a man
unless I trust him completely.

338
00:14:12,775 --> 00:14:13,986
I certainly understand that.

339
00:14:13,986 --> 00:14:16,971
But once I do,
I have orgasm after orgasm,

340
00:14:16,971 --> 00:14:18,911
especially if you
spank my bottom

341
00:14:18,911 --> 00:14:21,084
while I ride you like a Vespa.

342
00:14:25,547 --> 00:14:28,631
Okay. I'll-I'll try
to pass that along.

343
00:14:28,631 --> 00:14:29,526
Um...

344
00:14:29,526 --> 00:14:31,832
Okay, I'm going
to bed now.

345
00:14:31,832 --> 00:14:33,838
Night.
Hmm. Mm.

346
00:14:33,838 --> 00:14:35,828
By the way,
I know I haven't always

347
00:14:35,828 --> 00:14:37,155
been very warm to you.

348
00:14:37,155 --> 00:14:38,151
Well, that's true.

349
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:41,932
It's only 'cause I don't
care for you very much.

350
00:14:41,932 --> 00:14:44,337
Understood.

351
00:14:44,337 --> 00:14:45,299
Nighty-night.

352
00:14:45,299 --> 00:14:47,157
Good night.

353
00:14:48,899 --> 00:14:51,519
Nice change of pace
hearing it with an accent.

354
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:53,907
"I just don't
care for you very much."

355
00:14:53,907 --> 00:14:56,909
It's classy.

356
00:14:56,909 --> 00:14:57,887
Oh, hey.

357
00:14:57,887 --> 00:14:59,065
Oh, hey,
there you are.

358
00:14:59,065 --> 00:15:00,559
Zoey's looking
for you.

359
00:15:00,559 --> 00:15:01,537
She's here?

360
00:15:01,537 --> 00:15:02,863
Yeah, she
went to bed.

361
00:15:02,863 --> 00:15:06,014
Oh. Thank God.

362
00:15:06,014 --> 00:15:07,723
I better go check on her.

363
00:15:10,561 --> 00:15:12,980
But first, ice cream.

364

368
00:15:33,648 --> 00:15:35,703
I'm so sorry
about last night.

Don't be silly.

370
00:15:37,047 --> 00:15:39,352
I'm just glad you didn't
end up in a French prison.

371

I hope you don't think
I'm a lost cause.

No, no.

Glad to hear.

Don't worry, I will not stop

Nigel, what are
you doing here?

381
00:16:06,072 --> 00:16:07,813
I had to bring Ava back early.

382
00:16:07,813 --> 00:16:09,537
Hello. Nigel Pierce.

383
00:16:09,537 --> 00:16:10,799
Walden Schmidt.

384
00:16:10,799 --> 00:16:12,125
Nigel is my ex-husband.

385
00:16:12,125 --> 00:16:14,314
A role I relish.

386
00:16:16,024 --> 00:16:17,433
I need to catch
a plane to London,

387
00:16:17,433 --> 00:16:19,091
so you'll have to have Ava
for the weekend.

388
00:16:19,091 --> 00:16:20,650
And what if I have plans?

389
00:16:20,650 --> 00:16:23,404
Yes, I can see your plans.

390
00:16:23,404 --> 00:16:27,467
Mummy, Daddy said he
can't take me to the zoo.

391
00:16:27,467 --> 00:16:30,452
Oh, wonderful,
just wonderful.

392
00:16:30,452 --> 00:16:32,559
Are you and Daddy
going to fight?

393
00:16:32,559 --> 00:16:35,793
No. Mummy will take you
to the zoo instead of Daddy.

394
00:16:35,793 --> 00:16:38,033
Brilliant, make me the bad guy.

395
00:16:38,033 --> 00:16:41,100
Oh, no one made you the bad guy,
you were born to it.

396
00:16:42,395 --> 00:16:43,837
Uh, you know what, Ava?

397
00:16:43,837 --> 00:16:45,247
I'm a little thirsty.

398
00:16:45,247 --> 00:16:47,851
Maybe you could show me where
I could get a glass of water.

399
00:16:47,851 --> 00:16:49,509
Is it all right, Mummy?

400
00:16:49,509 --> 00:16:51,167
Yeah. Good idea.

401
00:16:51,167 --> 00:16:53,009
Come on, then.

402
00:16:54,453 --> 00:16:57,735
They're gonna
fight now.

403
00:16:57,735 --> 00:16:59,311
Yeah, I know.

404
00:16:59,311 --> 00:17:02,380
So this is what you
prefer now, hmm?

405
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:04,038

He happens to be a billionaire.

407
00:17:06,527 --> 00:17:12,547
Yes, well, I happen to be
107th in line to the throne.

00:17:24,969 --> 00:17:28,303
This is the best water
I have ever had.

413
00:17:29,416 --> 00:17:30,741
Did you make this yourself?

414
00:17:30,741 --> 00:17:33,677
No, silly, it came
out of the fridge.

415
00:17:33,677 --> 00:17:34,422
Oh.

416
00:17:35,669 --> 00:17:37,491
Well, then cheers.

417
00:17:37,491 --> 00:17:38,485
Mmm.

418
00:17:42,916 --> 00:17:45,752
I'm a queen.

419
00:17:45,752 --> 00:17:46,780
You are?

420
00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:48,770
Queen Ava.

421
00:17:48,770 --> 00:17:50,678
Well, then what am I?

422
00:17:50,678 --> 00:17:53,381
I have no idea.

423
00:17:56,350 --> 00:17:58,688
Walden Schmidt, Your Majesty.

424
00:17:58,688 --> 00:18:01,375
Pleased to meet you.

425
00:18:01,375 --> 00:18:03,829
I shall call you Sir Schmidt.

426
00:18:03,829 --> 00:18:05,439
Oh! At your service.

427
00:18:05,439 --> 00:18:06,184
Oh!

428
00:18:08,012 --> 00:18:08,847
Oh! Oh!

429
00:18:10,913 --> 00:18:13,897
Well, you two seem
to be getting along.

430
00:18:13,897 --> 00:18:16,932
Can Sir Schmidt come
with us to the zoo?

431
00:18:16,932 --> 00:18:18,259
Sir Schmidt?

432
00:18:18,259 --> 00:18:19,901
Hmm. I don't know.

433
00:18:19,901 --> 00:18:21,245
Please?

434
00:18:21,245 --> 00:18:23,384
He's my loyal subject.

435
00:18:23,384 --> 00:18:26,005
Well, I suppose, if he wants.

436
00:18:26,005 --> 00:18:29,239
I live to do
the queen's bidding.

437
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:32,838
All right,
go and get your jacket.

438
00:18:32,838 --> 00:18:33,832
Yay!

439
00:18:35,377 --> 00:18:37,532
Sir Schmidt?

440
00:18:37,532 --> 00:18:40,649
My grandfather shortened it
from Schmidt-a-Lot.

441
00:18:45,444 --> 00:18:47,317
Oh, goodness.

442
00:18:47,317 --> 00:18:48,776
That was quite a day.

443
00:18:48,776 --> 00:18:50,684
Yeah. It was fun, wasn't it?

444
00:18:50,684 --> 00:18:52,094
It was.

445
00:18:52,094 --> 00:18:53,404
Is she still sleeping?

446
00:18:53,404 --> 00:18:55,162
She's comatose.

447
00:18:55,162 --> 00:18:56,821
Here, let me
take her.

448
00:18:56,821 --> 00:18:57,815
Shh.

449
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:01,083
Oh, dear, you have a bit
of drool on your shoulder.

450
00:19:01,083 --> 00:19:02,659
Oh, that's not a problem.

451
00:19:02,659 --> 00:19:05,843
My housekeeper has a lot of
experience with drool stains.

452
00:19:05,843 --> 00:19:07,800
Ah. I'm gonna go
and put her down.

453
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:08,978
Be right back.

454
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:20,290
Hey, Jake.

455
00:19:20,290 --> 00:19:22,445
Really? You found Zoey.

456
00:19:26,245 --> 00:19:28,616
That's great.

457
00:19:28,616 --> 00:19:30,822
Thank you.

458
00:19:32,547 --> 00:19:35,697
Little dude's got to lay off
the brownies.

459
00:19:35,697 --> 00:19:38,235
She's absolutely
knackered.

460
00:19:38,235 --> 00:19:39,844
It was a long day.

461
00:19:39,844 --> 00:19:41,834
You were just
wonderful with her.

462
00:19:41,834 --> 00:19:43,476
Thanks.

463
00:19:44,289 --> 00:19:46,777
Well, I guess
I better head home.

464
00:19:46,777 --> 00:19:49,149
I think not.

465
00:19:49,149 --> 00:19:50,559
What's happening?

466
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:51,669
It's very,
very simple.

467
00:19:51,669 --> 00:19:53,494
I'm going to take
you into my bedroom

468
00:19:53,494 --> 00:19:55,766
and bang you like
a snare drum.

469
00:19:57,591 --> 00:19:58,967
Yippee!

00:19:58,967 --> 00:20:00,791

Oh, hey.
Where you been?

474
00:20:10,552 --> 00:20:12,857
I went to the zoo with Zoey
and her little girl.

475
00:20:12,857 --> 00:20:14,698
Wow! So you finally
met the daughter.

476
00:20:14,698 --> 00:20:16,639
Yep.
Might make it tough

477
00:20:16,639 --> 00:20:17,932
if the relationship
doesn't work out.

478
00:20:17,932 --> 00:20:19,011
Why wouldn't it work out?

479
00:20:19,011 --> 00:20:20,586
Well, you know, the lack of

480
00:20:20,586 --> 00:20:22,079
sexual chemistry
you were talking about.

481
00:20:22,079 --> 00:20:24,434
Oh, no, we're way past that.

482
00:20:24,434 --> 00:20:27,171
Oh. So she opened up
about her trust issues?

483
00:20:27,171 --> 00:20:28,298
Trust issues?

484
00:20:28,298 --> 00:20:30,604
No, zoos make her horny.

485
00:20:32,429 --> 00:20:33,805
Really? You think that's it?

486
00:20:33,805 --> 00:20:35,264
Yep.

487
00:20:35,264 --> 00:20:38,167
Next weekend, we're going to
the San Diego Wild Animal Park.

488
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:43,541
Uh...

489
00:20:43,541 --> 00:20:44,868

00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:48,135
Yeah.

493
00:20:55,002 --> 00:20:55,748
Ah.

494
00:20:56,944 --> 00:20:59,148
It's nice
to meet you.

495
00:21:00,625 --> 00:21:02,133
Well?

496
00:21:02,133 --> 00:21:03,501
Keep looking.
