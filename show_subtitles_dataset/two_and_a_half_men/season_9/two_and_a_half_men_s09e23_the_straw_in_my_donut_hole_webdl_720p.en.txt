1
00:00:01,576 --> 00:00:02,910
Previously on:

2
00:00:03,555 --> 00:00:05,765
I know that I said that I wanted
to get rid of her

3
00:00:05,767 --> 00:00:07,853
and have you come back...
Oh, no!

4
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:09,554
I'm just going to have
to make it work.

5
00:00:09,579 --> 00:00:11,061
No, no, no, no, no!

6
00:00:11,062 --> 00:00:12,162
I'm sorry!

7
00:00:12,164 --> 00:00:14,781
Okay, I'll figure something out.

8
00:00:14,783 --> 00:00:17,250
If nothing else,
I am a survivor.

9
00:00:22,882 --> 00:00:25,362
Doctor said you had
a little heart attack.

10
00:00:25,387 --> 00:00:27,387
Yeah, I remember now.

11
00:00:28,213 --> 00:00:30,413
Zoey's moving in...

12
00:00:30,415 --> 00:00:34,017
and I'm moving out...

13
00:00:35,754 --> 00:00:37,354
No...

14
00:00:37,356 --> 00:00:38,874
No... you're not moving out.

15
00:00:38,875 --> 00:00:39,620
I'm not?

16
00:00:39,645 --> 00:00:41,945
No, you can stay
as long as you want,

17
00:00:41,977 --> 00:00:43,560
as long as you need.

18
00:00:43,562 --> 00:00:46,863
Oh, that's... that's so good to hear.

19
00:00:48,573 --> 00:00:50,491
Really, you don't have
to carry my bags.

20
00:00:50,493 --> 00:00:52,276
Alan, you had
a heart attack, okay?

21
00:00:52,278 --> 00:00:53,527
You need to take it easy.

22
00:00:53,529 --> 00:00:55,079
Well, I appreciate it,
but I'm fine.

23
00:00:55,081 --> 00:00:57,898
Whoa, do not say that.

24
00:00:57,900 --> 00:00:59,116
Why not?

25
00:00:59,118 --> 00:01:00,901
Let me tell you
about my Grandma Abigail.

26
00:01:00,903 --> 00:01:03,304
When I was a kid,
she came to move in with us.

27
00:01:03,306 --> 00:01:05,489
And one day I said,
"How ya doing, Grandma"

28
00:01:05,491 --> 00:01:09,710
And she said, "Fine."
And then she dropped dead.

29
00:01:09,712 --> 00:01:10,845
You're kidding.

30
00:01:10,847 --> 00:01:13,681
No, face down in my Legos.

31
00:01:13,683 --> 00:01:16,250
Well, that's terrible.

32
00:01:16,252 --> 00:01:18,970
But I'm fine.
Do not say that!

33
00:01:18,972 --> 00:01:20,771
My Uncle Hal?

34
00:01:20,773 --> 00:01:23,057
When I was a kid, he used
to spend Thanksgivings us,

35
00:01:23,059 --> 00:01:24,475
and one year,
we're at dinner and...

36
00:01:24,477 --> 00:01:26,477
you know, like football
and turkey and the whole bit,

37
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:28,362
and I said,
"How ya doing, Uncle Hal"

38
00:01:28,364 --> 00:01:29,513
And he said, "Fine"

39
00:01:29,515 --> 00:01:31,248
And then he went
to the bathroom,

40
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:34,068
and he crapped out
his small intestines.

41
00:01:35,537 --> 00:01:37,388
Oh, oh... okay,
t-that's horrible,

42
00:01:37,390 --> 00:01:39,991
but I promise you,
I am fine.

43
00:01:39,993 --> 00:01:41,742
Surprise!

44
00:01:44,612 --> 00:01:47,614
I told you not to say it!

Original Air Date on May 7, 2012

00:01:54,442 --> 00:01:57,442
== sync, corrected by elderman ==

49
00:01:57,708 --> 00:01:59,375
Oh, my God,
somebody call 911.

50
00:01:59,377 --> 00:02:00,877
Gotcha.

51
00:02:00,879 --> 00:02:02,912
Oh...

52
00:02:02,914 --> 00:02:07,050
Alan, don't you ever
do that to me again.

53
00:02:07,052 --> 00:02:08,768
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

54
00:02:08,770 --> 00:02:11,020
So all you guys came
just to welcome me back?

55
00:02:11,022 --> 00:02:13,339
Of course we did, darling.
We were worried about you.

56
00:02:13,341 --> 00:02:17,527
Yeah, I've been beside myself
with concern.

57
00:02:17,529 --> 00:02:19,979
I don't know what to say.
I'm really touched.

58
00:02:19,981 --> 00:02:21,564
Come here, Alan.

59
00:02:21,566 --> 00:02:23,483
Sit down.
I made you some tea.

60
00:02:23,485 --> 00:02:24,867
Wait, did you just
call me Alan?

61
00:02:24,869 --> 00:02:26,185
Well, that's your name,
isn't it?

62
00:02:26,187 --> 00:02:27,654
Yeah, but you always
call me Zippy.

63
00:02:27,656 --> 00:02:29,706
I know, but I've got
a little rule.

64
00:02:29,708 --> 00:02:32,875
I never make fun of someone who
could come back and haunt me.

65
00:02:34,695 --> 00:02:36,295
Sugar or honey?

66
00:02:36,297 --> 00:02:38,131
I thought we decided on Alan?

67
00:02:39,467 --> 00:02:40,199
Uh, honey, please.

68
00:02:40,201 --> 00:02:41,525
Hey, are you warm enough?

69
00:02:41,552 --> 00:02:42,498
Do you want me
to turn up the heat?

70
00:02:42,636 --> 00:02:44,087
I'm fine.
Don't say that...

71
00:02:44,089 --> 00:02:46,222
Okay, turn up the heat.

72
00:02:46,224 --> 00:02:48,841
Why don't you just lay down.

73
00:02:48,843 --> 00:02:49,592
Uh, no, really, I'm good.
I've been in bed for a week.

74
00:02:49,594 --> 00:02:51,144
Do it for me.

75
00:02:51,146 --> 00:02:52,812
Uh, okay, but let me
just point out

76
00:02:53,764 --> 00:02:54,897
that that never works
when I say that to you.

77
00:02:56,718 --> 00:02:58,518
Guess what. While you were
in the hospital,

78
00:02:58,539 --> 00:02:59,914
I aced all my final exams.

79
00:03:00,255 --> 00:03:01,405
Really?
I don't believe it!

80
00:03:01,406 --> 00:03:04,741
I told you
he wouldn't buy it.

81
00:03:04,743 --> 00:03:06,693
Wait, wait, wait.
You lied to me?

82
00:03:07,745 --> 00:03:10,146
Uh, I told him to. I thought
the truth might kill you.

83
00:03:11,231 --> 00:03:13,082
But there is some real good news.
What's that?

84
00:03:13,784 --> 00:03:14,901
I found out for sure
I'm not gay.

85
00:03:15,502 --> 00:03:17,103
But why's that good news?

86
00:03:17,105 --> 00:03:19,455
It's mostly good news
for gay people.

87
00:03:21,592 --> 00:03:24,293
A-A-All right, look,
I appreciate

88
00:03:24,295 --> 00:03:26,379
all the trouble you're taking
to welcome me home,

89
00:03:27,581 --> 00:03:29,198
but if you don't mind, I'd just
like to go back to my room.

90
00:03:29,683 --> 00:03:30,983
Oh, you heard him.

91
00:03:31,035 --> 00:03:31,968
He wants to go to his room.
Here, Zoey.

92
00:03:32,352 --> 00:03:33,803
Take the tea.

93
00:03:33,805 --> 00:03:35,555
Walden, I can walk on my own.

94
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,224
That's what my
blind Aunt Shirley said.

95
00:03:38,809 --> 00:03:39,725
And then we went to Miami

96
00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:40,943
on Christmas vacation,

97
00:03:40,945 --> 00:03:42,395
and then "blam"

98
00:03:42,396 --> 00:03:44,130
Greyhound came out of nowhere
and flattened her.

99
00:03:44,223 --> 00:03:45,023
She got hit by a bus?

100
00:03:45,774 --> 00:03:46,917
No, she wandered
onto the dog track

101
00:03:46,942 --> 00:03:48,165
in the middle
of the ninth race.

102
00:03:49,111 --> 00:03:50,945
Technically,
she came in third.

103
00:03:52,514 --> 00:03:55,250
Anyway, I got a little
♪ surprise for you. ♪

104
00:03:56,151 --> 00:03:57,569
Oh, Walden, you've already
done so much.

105
00:03:58,654 --> 00:04:00,071
I don't know what else
you could possibly...

106
00:04:02,124 --> 00:04:03,741
A real bed!
Yeah.

107
00:04:03,743 --> 00:04:06,160
It's not just a bed.
Get on it. Check it out.

108
00:04:06,862 --> 00:04:08,162
Oh, my golly.

109
00:04:08,164 --> 00:04:10,448
Ah...
Oo-ho-ho-ho!

110
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:13,084
The bed is becoming tumescent.

111
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:14,719
Yeah...!

112
00:04:14,721 --> 00:04:16,337
Pretty cool, uh?

113
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:18,172
See, so you don't have
to exert yourself

114
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:19,474
when you're getting
in and out.

115
00:04:19,475 --> 00:04:20,758
Ah! Oh,

116
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,427
and what pray tell is that?

117
00:04:23,479 --> 00:04:27,148
That is a 46" high-definition
plasma screen TV,

118
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:29,734
complete with a deluxe sports
satellite package

119
00:04:29,736 --> 00:04:32,153
Nice! No movies?

120
00:04:33,772 --> 00:04:35,823
No, we could switch it
to a movie package.

121
00:04:36,308 --> 00:04:37,942
Or you could add it.

122
00:04:38,744 --> 00:04:40,528
Oh, okay, we'll add it.

123
00:04:41,113 --> 00:04:41,996
And don't forget
the adult channels.

124
00:04:43,215 --> 00:04:44,449
No problem.

125
00:04:44,451 --> 00:04:45,867
You have to ask
for them specifically.

126
00:04:46,452 --> 00:04:47,201
Otherwise they block them.

127
00:04:47,203 --> 00:04:48,620
Right.

128
00:04:48,622 --> 00:04:51,322
Hey, why don't you take
a nap until dinner?

129
00:04:51,924 --> 00:04:52,790
I'm not tired.

130
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:54,375
That's what my
cousin Earl said

131
00:04:55,628 --> 00:04:56,544
right before he fell asleep
with a cigarette in his hand.

132
00:04:57,046 --> 00:04:57,829
Set his bed on fire?

133
00:04:58,364 --> 00:04:59,364
No, his fireworks stand.

134
00:05:00,532 --> 00:05:02,884
I was standing across the street
yelling at him to wake up

135
00:05:04,136 --> 00:05:06,837
when the first rocket went off,
followed by 800 Roman candles.

136
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:12,009
It was horrifying and really
cool at the same time.

137
00:05:12,011 --> 00:05:13,978
Okay, I'll take a nap.

138
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:15,179
Good, good, good,
you just...

139
00:05:15,898 --> 00:05:16,898
I don't want you
to do anything.

140
00:05:16,899 --> 00:05:17,958
Just relax
and get better.

141
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:19,483
That's a nice thought, Walden,

142
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:20,318
but I got a lot of work to do.

143
00:05:20,319 --> 00:05:21,322
I got bills to pay.

144
00:05:21,487 --> 00:05:22,537
No, don't worry about the bills.

145
00:05:22,538 --> 00:05:23,612
I'll take care of everything.

146
00:05:24,356 --> 00:05:25,842
Walden, I can't let you
just take care of everything.

147
00:05:26,058 --> 00:05:28,360
Listen, I made a promise to
myself when I was 11 years old

148
00:05:28,627 --> 00:05:30,845
and salmonella decimated
my father's entire side

149
00:05:30,996 --> 00:05:32,650
of the family
at the annual Easter egg hunt.

150
00:05:32,998 --> 00:05:34,382
Nobody else dies on my watch.

151
00:05:37,886 --> 00:05:41,172
Poor guy,
living with all that guilt.

152
00:05:42,808 --> 00:05:45,009
I can exploit that.

153
00:05:46,679 --> 00:05:48,179
How come you're not coming over?

154
00:05:48,681 --> 00:05:49,880
I can't. I have Ava.

155
00:05:50,349 --> 00:05:51,501
Why don't you come over here?

156
00:05:51,717 --> 00:05:52,767
I can't. I have Alan.

157
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:54,569
Oh, for God's sake.

158
00:05:54,571 --> 00:05:56,721
Well, he had
a heart attack, Zoey.

159
00:05:57,122 --> 00:05:57,789
Oh, bollocks.

160
00:05:57,791 --> 00:05:59,724
He's going to outlive us all.

161
00:06:00,909 --> 00:06:02,660
A week after nuclear Armageddon,
the world will be populated

162
00:06:03,562 --> 00:06:05,780
by nothing but cockroaches
and Alan Harper.

163
00:06:05,782 --> 00:06:09,617
Wow, that is a side of you
that is not attractive.

164
00:06:10,252 --> 00:06:11,359
It's the lawyer side of me.

165
00:06:11,403 --> 00:06:12,704
Yeah, yuck.

166
00:06:12,706 --> 00:06:15,906
Look, I see these kind
of scam artists all the time

167
00:06:16,875 --> 00:06:18,409
and I don't want
you being taken advantage of.

168
00:06:19,244 --> 00:06:20,545
I am just taking care
of my friend.

169
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:24,515
No, you are providing food,
shelter, and satellite TV

170
00:06:24,517 --> 00:06:26,267
to a cockroach.

171
00:06:26,269 --> 00:06:28,636
Hello, anybody?

172
00:06:28,638 --> 00:06:31,222
Getting kind of hungry
in here.

173
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:33,808
Uh, B-Berta, Alan's hungry.

174
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:35,259
Is his dinner ready yet?

175
00:06:35,761 --> 00:06:36,611
Coming up.

176
00:06:36,613 --> 00:06:38,396
Really?

177
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:39,864
He gets room service?

178
00:06:39,866 --> 00:06:41,899
Did I ever tell you
about my Aunt Phyllis?

179
00:06:43,269 --> 00:06:46,710
When I was a kid she took me
on a trip to New York,

180
00:06:46,955 --> 00:06:48,440
and we were staying
at the Waldorf-Astoria,

181
00:06:48,457 --> 00:06:50,078
and she didn't want
to wait for room service,

182
00:06:50,108 --> 00:06:51,575
so she headed down
to the restaurant

183
00:06:52,044 --> 00:06:55,379
and she fell 24 stories
down an empty elevator shaft.

184
00:06:56,582 --> 00:06:59,617
We never got to see Cats.

185
00:06:59,619 --> 00:07:03,004
So you're afraid Alan is going
to fall into an elevator shaft?

186
00:07:04,056 --> 00:07:06,224
Don't poke at it, Zoey.
The wound is still fresh.

187
00:07:12,348 --> 00:07:13,514
Come in.

188
00:07:15,434 --> 00:07:17,802
Did my little buddy save
room for dessert?

189
00:07:18,303 --> 00:07:19,437
I sure did, Skipper.

190
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:21,189
Good, 'cause I made
your favorite.

191
00:07:21,723 --> 00:07:22,473
Peach cobbler?
Yep.

192
00:07:22,475 --> 00:07:23,641
Warm with ice cream?

193
00:07:24,142 --> 00:07:25,743
I'll be right back.

194
00:07:25,745 --> 00:07:27,361
I'm not going anywhere.

195
00:07:28,648 --> 00:07:33,584
Okay, let's see
what's on those adult channels.

196
00:07:33,586 --> 00:07:35,036
Avatart.

197
00:07:35,038 --> 00:07:38,039
Oh, in 3D.

198
00:07:40,175 --> 00:07:40,958
Oh, to be continued.

199
00:07:41,544 --> 00:07:42,710
Come in.

200
00:07:44,162 --> 00:07:45,379
Hey, you.

201
00:07:45,381 --> 00:07:47,832
Judith, what a,
what a nice surprise.

202
00:07:48,333 --> 00:07:49,166
How are you feeling?

203
00:07:49,835 --> 00:07:51,352
Not bad, all things considered.

204
00:07:51,354 --> 00:07:52,804
Oh, you're so brave.

205
00:07:52,806 --> 00:07:55,523
Now, listen, there's something
we need to talk about.

206
00:07:56,508 --> 00:07:58,513
Look, I know the child support
checks are late,

207
00:07:58,610 --> 00:08:00,344
but, but please allow me
to get back to my job.

208
00:08:02,115 --> 00:08:04,699
Er?

209
00:08:04,701 --> 00:08:06,851
Forget the
child support.

210
00:08:06,853 --> 00:08:08,903
Er?

211
00:08:08,905 --> 00:08:10,121
You just get better.

212
00:08:10,989 --> 00:08:12,206
I can manage fine
without your money.

213
00:08:12,541 --> 00:08:13,491
All right.

214
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:15,827
I always suspected as much,
but thank you.

215
00:08:16,829 --> 00:08:18,544
And Herb and I have the
condo in Palm Springs,

216
00:08:18,581 --> 00:08:20,002
so you're certainly
welcome to use it

217
00:08:20,132 --> 00:08:20,998
while you're
recuperating.

218
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,867
How can you afford
a condo in Palm Springs?

219
00:08:23,221 --> 00:08:25,271
We made a judgment call
with Jake's college fund.

220
00:08:25,838 --> 00:08:28,372
Anyway, you're
welcome to use it.

221
00:08:28,374 --> 00:08:30,508
Wow, thank you,
th-that's very generous.

222
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:34,145
Well, look, I know we've
obviously had our differences.

223
00:08:34,147 --> 00:08:35,847
We have.

224
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:38,266
And I haven't always
been very nice to you.

225
00:08:39,017 --> 00:08:40,885
I just figured
you didn't like me.

226
00:08:40,887 --> 00:08:43,396
Alan, we were married
for 12 years.

227
00:08:43,555 --> 00:08:44,973
You're the father
of my son.

228
00:08:45,173 --> 00:08:46,293
Just because I couldn't
stay married to you

229
00:08:46,294 --> 00:08:47,828
doesn't mean I
stopped loving you.

230
00:08:48,059 --> 00:08:49,660
Gee, it sure felt
that way.

231
00:08:49,662 --> 00:08:51,529
Oh, I'm sorry
for that.

232
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:54,231
You just get
well, okay?

233
00:08:54,233 --> 00:08:56,000
Okay.

234
00:09:00,789 --> 00:09:03,791
A house in Malibu,
no child support,

235
00:09:03,793 --> 00:09:06,377
free condo in Palm Springs.

236
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:09,430
Why would anyone want
to eliminate heart disease?

237
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:15,686
Don't worry,
you lovely blue ladies,

238
00:09:16,438 --> 00:09:17,942
as soon
as my right hand is free,

239
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:20,358
I'll be giving you
my full attention.

240
00:09:21,644 --> 00:09:22,643
Rats.

241
00:09:22,645 --> 00:09:23,895
Uh...

242
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:26,931
Come in.

243
00:09:27,783 --> 00:09:29,784
How's my man?

244
00:09:29,786 --> 00:09:32,453
Oh, you know, okay

245
00:09:32,455 --> 00:09:35,940
for a guy who recently stared
into the jaws of death.

246
00:09:36,441 --> 00:09:37,556
That's why I'm here.

247
00:09:37,808 --> 00:09:39,026
I want to help
with your recovery.

248
00:09:39,351 --> 00:09:41,012
Really, what'd
you have in mind?

249
00:09:41,112 --> 00:09:41,946
I-I'm not supposed
to exert myself.

250
00:09:42,882 --> 00:09:45,583
Don't worry, you don't have
to do a thing.

251
00:09:46,468 --> 00:09:48,285
Just lie back
and I'll do all the work.

252
00:09:48,553 --> 00:09:48,970
Really?

253
00:09:48,972 --> 00:09:50,338
Hmm.
Okay.

254
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:51,923
Uh, let me put
my cobbler down.

255
00:09:52,457 --> 00:09:53,791
No, no, no,
keep it.

256
00:09:53,793 --> 00:09:54,725
You sure?

257
00:09:54,727 --> 00:09:56,794
Absolutely.

258
00:09:56,796 --> 00:09:59,230
It'd be rude for
me to eat alone.

259
00:10:02,484 --> 00:10:04,468
All righty then.

260
00:10:06,471 --> 00:10:08,940
You got any porn
on this thing?

261
00:10:09,524 --> 00:10:10,908
Uh, gee, I,
I don't know.

262
00:10:13,246 --> 00:10:14,745
Why don't you check?

263
00:10:14,747 --> 00:10:16,146
Shake things up a bit.

264
00:10:16,698 --> 00:10:18,282
Oh, gosh,
well, I, yeah,

265
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:20,618
I guess I, I guess I,
I-I could do that.

266
00:10:22,588 --> 00:10:26,257
Oh, look,
there's some now.

267
00:10:26,259 --> 00:10:28,175
How fortuitous.

268
00:10:28,177 --> 00:10:32,797
Now, just relax and
enjoy your cobbler.

269
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:34,932
Right back at you.

270
00:10:38,688 --> 00:10:42,357
This is the best day
of my entire life.

271
00:10:48,338 --> 00:10:49,972
♪ Men. ♪

272
00:10:52,009 --> 00:10:54,627
All right, Mr. Harper.

273
00:10:58,982 --> 00:11:00,682
Well, I've got
some good news.

274
00:11:01,067 --> 00:11:01,850
Let me have it.

275
00:11:02,485 --> 00:11:04,453
I'm banging my receptionist.

276
00:11:06,039 --> 00:11:07,189
I'm sorry.

277
00:11:07,191 --> 00:11:09,758
I... I never get tired
of that one.

278
00:11:09,806 --> 00:11:11,750
That-that's funny,
but, uh, what about me?

279
00:11:12,196 --> 00:11:13,712
No, you don't have
a chance with her.

280
00:11:14,965 --> 00:11:16,799
She likes rich guys.

281
00:11:18,552 --> 00:11:20,920
All right,
back to your, uh, heart.

282
00:11:21,371 --> 00:11:22,204
It's looking good.

283
00:11:22,206 --> 00:11:23,756
Uh, are you sure?

284
00:11:23,758 --> 00:11:25,808
Tests show you've had no damage.

285
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:27,509
Your cholesterol looks normal.

286
00:11:27,511 --> 00:11:29,562
It's like the heart attack
never even happened.

287
00:11:29,813 --> 00:11:30,980
Oh.

288
00:11:30,982 --> 00:11:34,266
And you're not happy about that?

289
00:11:34,268 --> 00:11:35,684
No, I-I am.

290
00:11:35,686 --> 00:11:38,654
Um, uh, is this confidential,
what we're saying?

291
00:11:38,656 --> 00:11:40,722
Think of me as a priest.

292
00:11:41,825 --> 00:11:43,892
Except, when I touch your nuts,
it's strictly business.

293
00:11:45,195 --> 00:11:47,997
Okay, uh... uh, uh, here it is.

294
00:11:47,999 --> 00:11:50,249
Um, ever since the heart attack,

295
00:11:50,251 --> 00:11:52,918
uh, my life
has actually gotten better.

296
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:54,510
Uh, my girlfriend,
my ex-wife,

297
00:11:54,511 --> 00:11:56,040
even my mother
have all been showering me

298
00:11:56,041 --> 00:11:57,100
with love and attention.

299
00:11:57,167 --> 00:11:59,085
Well, they were afraid
they were losing you.

300
00:11:59,278 --> 00:12:01,381
Have you ever had oral sex
and peach cobbler?

301
00:12:03,597 --> 00:12:05,414
At the same time?

302
00:12:07,434 --> 00:12:09,602
Can't say that I have.

303
00:12:09,604 --> 00:12:10,686
Well, I have.

304
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:12,484
And once my girlfriend
finds out that I'm healthy,

305
00:12:12,490 --> 00:12:14,652
I'm back to sucking Life Savers
and humping my pillow.

306
00:12:16,643 --> 00:12:20,062
Well, as your doctor,
all I can tell you

307
00:12:20,064 --> 00:12:21,447
is you're
perfectly healthy.

308
00:12:21,449 --> 00:12:22,898
Can I get a second opinion?

309
00:12:23,433 --> 00:12:24,533
Yes, you're ugly, too.

310
00:12:27,487 --> 00:12:28,737
I joke.

311
00:12:28,739 --> 00:12:31,440
Uh, again, as your doctor,

312
00:12:31,442 --> 00:12:34,326
I have to tell you
you're in great shape.

313
00:12:34,628 --> 00:12:36,211
But, uh...

314
00:12:36,213 --> 00:12:38,998
as a guy who's banging
his receptionist,

315
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,966
two pharmaceutical reps

316
00:12:40,968 --> 00:12:44,920
and, uh, on occasion,
his bloated, rich wife,

317
00:12:44,922 --> 00:12:46,972
let me add:

318
00:12:46,974 --> 00:12:48,657
Don't be a schmuck.

319
00:12:48,659 --> 00:12:50,959
Lie your ass off.

320
00:12:51,745 --> 00:12:53,562
Thanks, Doc.
That's good advice.

321
00:12:57,651 --> 00:12:59,485
Hmm.

322
00:13:02,405 --> 00:13:04,273
Jeanine, hi.

323
00:13:04,275 --> 00:13:06,859
Uh, listen, could you
run down to the deli

324
00:13:07,494 --> 00:13:09,028
and pick up a peach cobbler

325
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:11,747
and meet me in exam room 2.

326
00:13:18,421 --> 00:13:20,255
How'd it go?

327
00:13:20,257 --> 00:13:21,290
Good news?

328
00:13:21,292 --> 00:13:23,375
It's bad, Mom.

329
00:13:23,377 --> 00:13:25,127
It's real bad.
Oh.

330
00:13:25,129 --> 00:13:28,180
Darling, I am so sorry.

331
00:13:28,182 --> 00:13:30,849
Hey, I know what
would cheer you up.

332
00:13:31,167 --> 00:13:33,102
So do I.

333
00:13:33,104 --> 00:13:35,521
No, I was thinking
I could take you shopping.

334
00:13:35,889 --> 00:13:36,689
Come on, now.

335
00:13:36,691 --> 00:13:37,785
There must be something
I can get you

336
00:13:37,786 --> 00:13:39,525
that would turn
that frown upside down.

337
00:13:40,944 --> 00:13:42,528
Well, uh, remember
when I was a kid

338
00:13:42,546 --> 00:13:43,880
how I always wanted
to be a cowboy?

339
00:13:45,565 --> 00:13:47,682
I'm not going to buy you
a horse, Alan.

340
00:13:48,068 --> 00:13:49,068
Of course not.

341
00:13:49,070 --> 00:13:52,371
Guess I'll just have to be
a cowboy in Heaven.

342
00:13:56,242 --> 00:13:57,692
Are your eyes closed?

343
00:13:58,194 --> 00:13:59,795
Yep, they're closed.

344
00:14:07,253 --> 00:14:09,037
Open.

345
00:14:13,510 --> 00:14:15,978
You must be kidding me.

346
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:18,835
It's the safest way for Alan
to get up and down the stairs.

347
00:14:18,935 --> 00:14:21,257
Why does he have to get
up and down the stairs?

348
00:14:22,569 --> 00:14:24,236
So he can use my whirlpool tub.

349
00:14:24,238 --> 00:14:25,687
Oh, dear Lord.

350
00:14:25,689 --> 00:14:27,189
He needs it for his circulation.

351
00:14:27,254 --> 00:14:28,915
He said he's starting
to get bed sores.

352
00:14:29,008 --> 00:14:31,473
Then you tell him
to get out of bed.

353
00:14:31,642 --> 00:14:33,861
You don't build him
his own private escalator.

354
00:14:42,419 --> 00:14:44,554
Howdy, pardner.

355
00:14:46,823 --> 00:14:49,091
Ma'am.

356
00:14:49,093 --> 00:14:50,326
Wow.

357
00:14:50,328 --> 00:14:51,511
You look great.

358
00:14:51,513 --> 00:14:53,563
Just checking it
off my bucket list.

359
00:14:54,097 --> 00:14:55,214
What'd the doctor say?

360
00:14:55,216 --> 00:14:56,716
It's not good.

361
00:14:57,518 --> 00:14:59,886
I might have to have
a transplant.

362
00:15:01,438 --> 00:15:03,356
I'm sorry.

363
00:15:03,358 --> 00:15:05,274
Let's just hope that somewhere

364
00:15:05,276 --> 00:15:06,726
there's a baboon
with a healthy heart

365
00:15:06,777 --> 00:15:08,459
riding a motorcycle
without a helmet.

366
00:15:11,148 --> 00:15:12,848
For God's sake.

367
00:15:12,850 --> 00:15:14,817
Excuse me.
I'm going to take a whirlpool

368
00:15:15,452 --> 00:15:16,485
until my masseuse gets here.

369
00:15:17,004 --> 00:15:18,621
You got him a masseuse?

370
00:15:18,623 --> 00:15:21,073
It helps prevent blood clots.

371
00:15:21,075 --> 00:15:23,876
Yeah.

372
00:15:28,048 --> 00:15:30,333
My Uncle Fred
had a blood clot in his leg,

373
00:15:30,413 --> 00:15:31,343
and when I was little,
he took me

374
00:15:31,503 --> 00:15:33,951
to the Santa Monica Pier,
and we went on the Tilt-A-Whirl,

375
00:15:33,977 --> 00:15:37,026
and the centrifugal force
shot the clot into his brain.

376
00:15:38,675 --> 00:15:40,993
It was the worst birthday ever.

377
00:15:40,995 --> 00:15:44,096
He's seen a lot
of tragedy, Zoey.

378
00:15:44,098 --> 00:15:46,098
Be nice to him.

379
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:55,408
Mmm.

380
00:15:55,410 --> 00:15:57,360
Too hard?

381
00:15:57,362 --> 00:15:59,728
Nah, dig in.
I like it rough.

382
00:16:00,563 --> 00:16:02,281
Brought your
banana smoothie.

383
00:16:02,283 --> 00:16:03,699
Oh, thank you, Zoey.

384
00:16:03,701 --> 00:16:05,234
Um, would you mind

385
00:16:05,236 --> 00:16:07,736
sticking the straw
in my donut hole?

386
00:16:08,738 --> 00:16:10,840
Oh, I would love to.

387
00:16:10,842 --> 00:16:12,574
Mmm.

388
00:16:12,576 --> 00:16:15,127
Tasty.

389
00:16:18,432 --> 00:16:21,750
I want you to listen
to me very carefully.

390
00:16:21,752 --> 00:16:24,470
You may have everyone
else around here fooled,

391
00:16:25,255 --> 00:16:27,589
but I know you're
full of crap.

392
00:16:27,591 --> 00:16:28,975
Beg pardon?

393
00:16:28,977 --> 00:16:30,476
What you do with
your family

394
00:16:30,579 --> 00:16:31,812
and your girlfriend
is your business,

395
00:16:32,111 --> 00:16:35,057
but I want you to stop
taking advantage of Walden.

396
00:16:35,157 --> 00:16:36,605
I-I don't know
what you're talking about.

397
00:16:36,606 --> 00:16:38,654
You know exactly what
I'm talking about.

398
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:40,193
I-I'm sorry. I really
don't know what you're...

399
00:16:40,198 --> 00:16:41,949
You've been warned.

400
00:16:45,909 --> 00:16:47,994
Well, thanks for the...
the smoothie, Zoey.

401
00:16:51,082 --> 00:16:53,249
That bitch has got to go.

402
00:16:59,172 --> 00:17:00,589
How about that?

403
00:17:00,591 --> 00:17:03,125
Stars really are just like us.

404
00:17:04,344 --> 00:17:06,145
Alan.
Oh!

405
00:17:07,397 --> 00:17:08,564
Oh, my.

406
00:17:08,566 --> 00:17:09,765
Careful.

407
00:17:09,767 --> 00:17:12,151
You don't want
to give me a heart attack.

408
00:17:12,686 --> 00:17:13,586
We need to talk to you.

409
00:17:13,987 --> 00:17:15,404
Oh, yeah, sure.

410
00:17:17,908 --> 00:17:19,575
I'll be right back.

411
00:17:19,577 --> 00:17:22,495
Um, think I left
the tub running, so...

412
00:17:22,497 --> 00:17:24,146
Stop.

413
00:17:25,365 --> 00:17:28,650
Now, get out of that chair
and get down here.

414
00:17:29,486 --> 00:17:30,819
Okay.

415
00:17:30,821 --> 00:17:33,372
The queen has spoken.

416
00:17:38,245 --> 00:17:41,931
My legs are still
a little al dente.

417
00:17:43,684 --> 00:17:45,685
So...

418
00:17:45,687 --> 00:17:47,603
what up?

419
00:17:48,838 --> 00:17:51,357
I'll tell you "what up."

420
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:54,176
I asked one of the private
investigators for my law firm

421
00:17:54,811 --> 00:17:56,228
to follow you for a few days.

422
00:17:56,513 --> 00:17:57,897
Really?

423
00:17:57,899 --> 00:18:00,783
Uh, uh, wh-which days
in particular?

424
00:18:00,785 --> 00:18:01,801
Well,

425
00:18:01,803 --> 00:18:03,869
this is from last Monday,

426
00:18:03,871 --> 00:18:05,237
when you said you were going

427
00:18:06,073 --> 00:18:08,073
for a therapeutic walk
on the beach.

428
00:18:37,104 --> 00:18:39,054
Okay. Okay.

429
00:18:39,056 --> 00:18:40,389
Yeah, yeah, you know...

430
00:18:40,391 --> 00:18:42,691
I can see

431
00:18:42,693 --> 00:18:44,243
how this looks,

432
00:18:44,245 --> 00:18:45,778
um,

433
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:47,729
but, you know, actually,

434
00:18:47,731 --> 00:18:49,665
there is a-a-a very...

435
00:18:49,667 --> 00:18:52,901
a very simple, uh,
uh, explanation.

436
00:19:03,079 --> 00:19:04,913
Okay.

437
00:19:04,915 --> 00:19:06,682
Well...

438
00:19:06,684 --> 00:19:08,551
we got cobbler
in the kitchen.

439
00:19:18,261 --> 00:19:20,613

00:19:20,615 --> 00:19:22,031
