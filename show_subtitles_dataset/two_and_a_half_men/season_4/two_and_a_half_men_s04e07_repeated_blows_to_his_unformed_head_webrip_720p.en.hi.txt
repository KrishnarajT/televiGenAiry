00:00:04,390 --> 00:00:06,420
(telephone rings)

2
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:09,230
Hello?

3
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:10,300
Hold on.

4
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:11,630
Are you in for suzanne?

5
00:00:13,870 --> 00:00:16,440
I kinda have to be.

6
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:18,930
You didn't put your hand
over the phone.

7
00:00:19,010 --> 00:00:21,850
Oh, right.

8
00:00:21,910 --> 00:00:23,580
Sorry, he's not here.

9
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:26,910
Gimme, gimme.

10
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:29,380
Sorry about that.
My brother's kid.

11
00:00:29,450 --> 00:00:31,880
Yeah, dumb as a stump.

12
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:34,320
(doorbell rings)

13
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:38,530
Hi.

14
00:00:42,430 --> 00:00:45,560
I'm not sure i have
the right address.

15
00:00:45,630 --> 00:00:47,600
No, you got
the right address.

16
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:52,410
Charlie, it's for you!

17
00:00:53,510 --> 00:00:55,810
Who is it?

18
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:59,890
Karma.

19
00:00:59,950 --> 00:01:01,490
What?

20
00:01:01,550 --> 00:01:04,390
Your chickens have
come home to roost.

21
00:01:05,490 --> 00:01:06,990
Chickens? Karma?

22
00:01:07,050 --> 00:01:09,320
Alan, what the hell
are you talking...

23
00:01:10,390 --> 00:01:12,560
Ew...

00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:44,520
Hey...

33
00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:47,020
Great to see you...

34
00:01:47,090 --> 00:01:49,590
Again.

35
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:51,990
I don't think we've met.

36
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:52,910
Really?

37
00:01:52,970 --> 00:01:54,270
Really.

38
00:01:54,330 --> 00:01:55,660
Are you trying
to give me a stroke?

39
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:58,040
Is that what
you're trying to do?

40
00:01:58,110 --> 00:01:59,340
Well, it's about time.

41
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:00,550
Oh, hey, mom.

42
00:02:00,610 --> 00:02:02,620
I got the cleaning stuff
you wanted.

43
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:05,380
Well, don't just
stand there.

44
00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:06,820
Get in the kitchen
and start using it.

45
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,440
Fine.

46
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:10,360
Berta, aren't you
going to introduce us?

47
00:02:10,420 --> 00:02:11,420
Oh, i'm sorry.

48
00:02:11,490 --> 00:02:12,530
Where are my manners?

49
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:14,660
Charlie, alan,

50
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:17,450
I'd like you to meet
my youngest daughter naomi—

51
00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:19,630
The light of my life.

52
00:02:19,690 --> 00:02:21,720
A little angel
who swooped down from heaven

53
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:24,500
And landed on
a married man's penis.

54
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:26,900
Mom!

55
00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:29,370
And when she got knocked up
and lost her job,

56
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,040
She had to come live with me.

57
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:32,670
They fired you
for being pregnant?

58
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:33,870
Yep. Being pregnant

59
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:36,940
And stealing a few
office supplies.

60
00:02:37,010 --> 00:02:40,840
Eight computers
and a xerox machine.

61
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:42,810
Not all at once.

62
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,720
So which one of you guys

63
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:47,930
Is the rich one
who likes to party?

64
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:51,900
Get to work.

65
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,900
All right.

66
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,860
And when you're done
in the kitchen,

67
00:02:55,930 --> 00:02:57,700
You can scrub the toilets.

68
00:02:57,770 --> 00:03:01,970
All right!

69
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:04,040
She wouldn't be
in this situation.

70
00:03:04,970 --> 00:03:06,900
Not necessarily.

71
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:11,540
Should she really be scrubbing
toilets in her condition?

72
00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:13,080
Hey, when i was pregnant
with her

73
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:14,920
I worked right up
until my water broke.

74
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:16,980
And then i used the water
to mop the floor.

75
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:21,830
I exaggerate for effect.

76
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:25,750
Wow.

77
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:28,900
Yeah, and we think
our family's screwed-Up.

78
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:34,360
No, no, i meant,
"wow, naomi is hot."

79
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:36,630
What?

80
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:38,870
Come on.
She's ripe and luscious.

81
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:42,680
I just want to caress
that taut, voluptuous belly

82
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:44,740
And, you know...

83
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:49,380
Ungh...

84
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:52,650
Who are you?

85
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,980
Oh, come on, you can't tell me
you don't appreciate

86
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:56,930
The beauty of a woman
in that condition.

87
00:03:56,990 --> 00:04:00,460
Okay, look, freako.

88
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:03,170
I get the aesthetic appeal

89
00:04:03,230 --> 00:04:04,760
Of a woman with
the glow of motherhood,

90
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:08,100
A new life growing inside
of her, blah, blah, blah.

91
00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:09,540
But long story short—

92
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,970
Once there's a bun
in the oven,

93
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:13,650
I don't feel the need
to butter it.

94
00:04:13,710 --> 00:04:15,880
Well, then you
have missed out

95
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:18,570
On one of the great sexual
experiences a man can have.

96
00:04:18,650 --> 00:04:20,550
There had to be one.

97
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,620
When judith was pregnant
with jake,

98
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,410
I-I don't know
if it was hormones

99
00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:29,030
Or pheromones, but she just
could not get enough of me.

100
00:04:29,090 --> 00:04:31,100
And ever since then, every time
i see a pregnant woman,

101
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,600
I just...

102
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:34,990
(moans)

103
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:37,990
Okay, seriously,
you got to stop that.

104
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:39,810
I am telling you,
it was nine months

105
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:41,170
Of the hottest sex
we've ever had,

106
00:04:41,230 --> 00:04:43,070
Even with the morning sickness
and hemorrhoids.

107
00:04:44,670 --> 00:04:46,100
Maybe that explains
jake's grades.

108
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:49,210
Morning sickness
and hemorrhoids?

109
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:52,990
No, the repeated blows
to his unformed head.

110
00:04:56,550 --> 00:04:57,950
You are such an idiot.

111
00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:00,090
All the experts agree
that sex during pregnancy

112
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:01,450
Is not harmful
to the baby.

113
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:04,050
Experts, shmexperts.

114
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:05,690
Tonight when you're sleeping,
i'm gonna come in

115
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:07,970
And start poking you
in the ear with a hot dog.

116
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:12,090
See how you like it.

117
00:05:12,170 --> 00:05:14,940
Okay, okay, clearly,
we have different opinions.

118
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,030
All i know is,
i find pregnant women

119
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:20,170
Very erotic.

120
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,810
Oh, hey, buddy.

121
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,080
Hi.

122
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:25,770
How long have
you been standing there?

123
00:05:25,850 --> 00:05:29,150
Long enough
to be very confused.

124
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:33,150
But we have hot dogs, right?

125
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:39,120
♪ Men

126
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:45,130
(moans)

127
00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:47,700
Excuse me?

128
00:05:47,770 --> 00:05:50,710
Oh, it's just
a little indigestion.

129
00:05:50,770 --> 00:05:54,740
So, uh, she's got you doing
a little ironing, huh?

130
00:05:54,810 --> 00:05:57,020
Yeah. Boy, i can't wait
to get this day over with

131
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:59,050
And take a nice, hot bath.

132
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:00,780
(moans)

133
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:07,990
You know, uh,

134
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:10,260
We happen to have a jacuzzi tub.

135
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:11,750
It, uh, has those jets and...

136
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,660
I'm okay.

137
00:06:16,730 --> 00:06:17,760
I'm okay.

138
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:18,830
(laughing):
are you sure?

139
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:20,570
Yeah, yeah, fine.

140
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:22,060
You, uh, you want me
to run some water for you?

141
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:22,980
No, no, i couldn't.

142
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,680
I got to keep working

143
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:27,050
Or my mom'll be all
over me like hair on soap.

144
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:32,110
Mm, you, uh,
you do paint a picture.

145
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:35,250
But still, you, you shouldn't
be working in your condition.

146
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:37,320
Come on, just, uh,
just sit here.

147
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:39,150
I'll, uh,
i'll finish it for you.

148
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:40,160
Really?

149
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:41,220
Yes, really.

150
00:06:41,290 --> 00:06:42,760
Why, thank you.

151
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:43,750
(both laugh)

152
00:06:46,290 --> 00:06:48,890
You're not doing
a very good job anyway.

153
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,170
Ooh.

154
00:06:53,230 --> 00:06:54,100
Hot.

155
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,280
So, you know what the baby is?

156
00:06:58,340 --> 00:07:01,650
Well, i'm hoping
for human.

157
00:07:03,810 --> 00:07:05,210
Uh, no, no, i meant boy or girl?

158
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,220
Oh, it's a girl.

159
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:07,350
Oh, oh, that's nice.

160
00:07:07,410 --> 00:07:09,040
I always wanted a girl.

161
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,590
I mean, you know, i love my son,
but let's face it,

162
00:07:11,650 --> 00:07:14,180
Girls are so much smarter
and more spiritual than boys.

163
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:17,220
Plus, we got all the boobies.

164
00:07:18,330 --> 00:07:20,600
All the good ones anyway.

165
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:24,590
Course, right now, mine feel
like two big bags of wet sand.

166
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:27,170
Nice.

167
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:29,970
My back is killing me,
my feet are swollen,

168
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:32,750
And i'm passing gas
like a nascar pit crew.

169
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:38,140
Well, i-I think you look...
Beautiful.

170
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:40,750
Aren't you sweet?

171
00:07:42,050 --> 00:07:43,660
Ooh. God, it feels

172
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:45,190
Like she's playing
hacky sack in there.

173
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:47,180
Wanna feel?
Yes.

174
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:53,230
Come on.

175
00:07:57,230 --> 00:07:58,660
What's going on here?

176
00:07:58,730 --> 00:07:59,960
Oh, hi, berta.

177
00:08:00,030 --> 00:08:01,760
The baby was kicking
and naomi asked me

178
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:03,710
If i wanted to feel the baby
kicking and i said, "sure,"

179
00:08:03,770 --> 00:08:05,300
Which is when you walked in,
and that's pretty much it.

180
00:08:05,370 --> 00:08:06,870
Okay.
