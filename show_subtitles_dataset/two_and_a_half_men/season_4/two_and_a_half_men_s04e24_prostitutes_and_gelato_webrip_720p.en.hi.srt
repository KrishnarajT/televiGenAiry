You didn't tell me
you had any kids.

have this conversation
another time?

No, no, no, no.
We are having it right now.

What do you want me to say?

400
00:17:50,830 --> 00:17:53,430
Teddy's fine. I like Teddy,

401
00:17:53,470 --> 00:17:56,330
but he's ready to settle down
and I'm not.

402
00:17:56,370 --> 00:17:57,640
I want my freedom.

403
00:17:57,670 --> 00:17:59,670
Okay, I get freedom,
but come on.

404

Teddy's way better
than this guy.

405
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:06,790
As I said, Teddy's fine,
but there are some areas

406
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:11,590
in which he just doesn't
measure up to Hugo.

Oh, Mom!
Oh, Mom!

408
00:18:17,790 --> 00:18:20,830
It's the biggest I've ever seen.

411
