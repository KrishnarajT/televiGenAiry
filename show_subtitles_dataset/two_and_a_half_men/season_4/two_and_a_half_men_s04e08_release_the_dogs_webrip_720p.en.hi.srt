00:00:13,150 --> 00:00:15,080
Ah! Oh! Oh!

3
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:16,930
Oh! Oh!

4
00:00:16,990 --> 00:00:18,750
Oh, God!

5
00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:20,900
Oh! Oh, God.

6
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:24,590
Oh, God.

7
00:00:24,670 --> 00:00:28,070
(moaning)

8
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:31,440
Oh, God. Oh...

9
00:00:31,510 --> 00:00:34,150
Oh, God. Oh. God.

10
00:00:34,210 --> 00:00:36,150
Oh, God.

11
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:39,590
I was picturing something
entirely different.

12
00:00:39,650 --> 00:00:41,850
I couldn't sleep.

13
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:44,590
So you decided to make
your nipples hard?

14
00:00:45,850 --> 00:00:47,550
Oh, the peas. No.

15
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:49,790
I was heating up
some milk and...

16
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:51,530
You know, my
nipple is hard.

17
00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:55,190
If you can't sleep,
why don't you just take a pill?

18
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:56,860
I don't believe in pills.

19
00:00:56,930 --> 00:00:57,690
What about booze?

20
00:00:57,770 --> 00:00:59,200
You believe in booze?

21
00:00:59,270 --> 00:01:01,110
That's not sleeping—
that's passing out.

22
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:03,980
Pot-ay-to, pot-ah-to.

23
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:05,210
I just, I have
a lot on my mind.

24
00:01:05,270 --> 00:01:06,870
I don't need
to drug myself.

25
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:09,170
Okay, in that case
I doknow a great,

26
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:10,040
all-natural sleep aid.

27
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:11,210
What's that?

28
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,950
Sex. You should get
yourself some sex.

29
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:15,810
It'll put you right out.
Charlie.

30
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:18,680
Look at me. I can hardly
keep my eyes open.

31
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:21,020
Well, sex is not really
an option at the moment.

32
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:23,160
You're telling me you
can't make a fist?

33
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:24,720
Just leave me alone.

34
00:01:24,790 --> 00:01:27,220
How about exercise?

35
00:01:27,290 --> 00:01:29,890
It's kinda like sex,
but without the condom.

36
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:32,160
You know,
that's not a bad idea.

37
00:01:32,230 --> 00:01:35,230
Well, you shouldalways
wear a condom.

38
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:36,630
No, I-I mean the exercise.

39
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:38,230
I-I could go
for a run on the beach.

40
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:40,010
Sure, I've seen
people do that.

41
00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:43,240
Usually they have a dog,
but I think that's optional.

42
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:45,010
Actually, that's a great idea.

43
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:47,490
Oh, where you gonna get
a dog at this hour.

44
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:49,150
You really enjoy screwing
with me, don't you?

45
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:52,690
Well, you don't pay rent.

46
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:53,680
You know what?

47
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:55,020
I'm gonna do it.

48
00:01:55,090 --> 00:01:56,130
Pay rent?

49
00:01:56,190 --> 00:01:59,030
No...

50
00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:00,890
I'm gonna jog down
to the pier and back.

51
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:03,160
Maybe I can burn off
my excess energy.

52
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:06,960
Attaboy.

53
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:20,080
Nah, I prefer the tater-tots.

54
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:27,080
This will do it.

55
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:29,080
Burn off the energy.

56
00:02:36,230 --> 00:02:38,640
That's interesting.

58
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:06,160
Nice night for a run.

59
00:03:06,230 --> 00:03:07,570
How rude.

60
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:11,670
HELICOPTER PILOT:
This is the Los Angeles
Sheriff's Department.

61

Stop running and drop to the

62
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:15,960
Oh, no, no, no!

63
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:17,110
You've got the wrong guy!

64
00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:19,300
The guy you want ran that way!

65
00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:20,840
This is your last warning.

66
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:22,720
Drop to the ground
with your arms spread.

67
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:24,980
You don't understand!

68
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:27,190

Put your hands behind your head
and drop to your knees!

71
00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:40,620
No, no, you don't understand.

72
00:03:40,690 --> 00:03:42,620
I just couldn't sleep.

73
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:44,640
Release the dogs!

74
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:46,100
Dog-dogs?

75
00:03:46,170 --> 00:03:48,110
No, no, no...

76
00:03:48,170 --> 00:03:49,210
No dogs.

Hey, it is good.

83
00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:31,740
Charlie, tell them who I am.

84
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:34,080
I'm sorry, who are you?

85
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:36,020
Charlie, if you don't
tell them who I am,

86
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,250
they're gonna take me to jail.

87
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:39,860
Why do you keep
calling me Charlie?

88
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:42,720
Sir, is this man
living here or not?

89
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:44,750
Define "living."

90
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:46,770
Charlie, I swear
on my son's life...

91
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:48,300
Yeah, he lives here.

92
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,990
I told you.

93
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:51,930
I've got your badge
numbers. I am gonna write

letter to...
Shut up.

At least this clown
didn't ask if I was Jewish.

99
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:09,150
So.

Let me tell you something, Jake.

121
00:06:09,010 --> 00:06:10,880
Big pharmaceutical companies
want you to think

122
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:11,940
you can take a pill
for everything.

123
00:06:12,010 --> 00:06:13,310
Can't sleep? Take a pill.

124
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:14,440
Can't wake up? Take a pill.

125
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:16,140
Feeling sad? Take a pill.

126
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:18,060
Can't get it up? Take a pill.

127
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:20,530
Can't get what up?

128
00:06:23,890 --> 00:06:25,890

your father's

133
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,010
not good enough for you?

134
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:39,210
It's not all of a sudden.

135
00:06:40,910 --> 00:06:42,850
Come on, Alan,
the kid's growing up.

136
00:06:42,910 --> 00:06:43,870
He's got his own life now.

137
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:45,210

No kids in my house.

00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:51,490
I'm a kid.

142
00:06:51,550 --> 00:06:54,450
Well, I don't think of you
as a kid.

143
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:58,550
I think of you as more of a...
gassy dwarf.

00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:01,400
Charlie,

145
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:02,420
you said it yourself—

00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:04,170
he's growing up.

147
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:05,830

He'll be going off
to college soon.

149
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:09,910
I'll only see him on holidays...

150
00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:11,430
only hear from him
when he needs money.

151
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:13,300
Not that I'll have any.

152
00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:16,140
I'll still be paying alimony
to two ex-wives.

153
00:07:16,210 --> 00:07:17,580
And college tuition?

154
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:21,540
That just means selling an organ
or turning tricks.

155
00:07:21,610 --> 00:07:24,450
And for what?

156
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:26,560
So that he can get
a worthless piece of paper

157
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:28,430
that he can then
fold into a hat

158
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:29,960
to wear to the fast-food job

159
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:31,950
that he will probably
be fired from

160
00:07:32,030 --> 00:07:34,200

from the customers' bags.

161
00:07:39,330 --> 00:07:41,530

00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:36,360
Oh, would you
please just get

184
00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:37,990
your drunken ass
out of bed

185
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:41,130
and stop being a waste of
skin for once in your life?

186
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:46,560
Well, since you said "please."

187
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,570
Thank you.

188
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,010
I'm, I'm sorry I barked at you.

189
00:08:54,070 --> 00:08:55,340
You still can't sleep, huh?

190
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:56,610
No.

191
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:58,480
Well, don't worry,
I'm here for you.

192
00:08:58,550 --> 00:09:00,320
I'll keep an eye
on the kids.

193
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:01,310
I appreciate it.

194
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:02,310
No problem.

195
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:13,460
It's like he's never met me.

196
00:09:18,030 --> 00:09:19,590
Nothing seems to work.

197
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:21,970
I-I've tried
warm milk, exercise,

198
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:23,880
meditation, self-hypnosis.

199
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:27,150
Why don't you just take a pill?

200
00:09:27,210 --> 00:09:28,580
Because I don't need a pill.

201
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,810
The root of my insomnia
is psychological.

202
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:33,450
That is why I'm sitting here
with you, a psychologist.

203
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:36,310
I'm a psychiatrist,
a medical doctor,

204
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:38,810
which is why
I can prescribe pills.

205
00:09:38,890 --> 00:09:40,390
Is that some kind of shot at me

206
00:09:40,450 --> 00:09:41,420
because I'm just
a chiropractor?

207
00:09:41,490 --> 00:09:43,200
No, of course not,

208
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:45,330
but I am a real doctor.

209
00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:48,060
Look, can you help me or not?

210
00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:50,070
You know,
delve into my subconscious

211
00:09:50,130 --> 00:09:51,560
and unravel the source
of my problem?

212
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:54,330
Sure, I'll give it a shot.

213
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:56,460
So, when was the last time
you had sex?

214
00:09:56,540 --> 00:09:59,040
This has nothing to do with sex!

215
00:09:59,110 --> 00:10:02,080
This has to do with alimony
and ex-wives and child support

216
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:04,040
an-and writing checks
I can't cover

217
00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:06,110
and having to live on my
brother's freaking hide-a-bed.

218
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:08,150
Okay, why don't we start
with your brother?

219
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:09,420
What does my brother
have to do with this?

220
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:10,910
Who's the doctor here?

221
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:12,250
Okay, that was a shot.

222
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,330
You got me.

223
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,390
Now tell me about your brother.

224
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:20,330
What is there to say? Um...

225
00:10:20,390 --> 00:10:24,190
He's two years older than me,
but much more immature.

226
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:25,330
He's charming and easygoing.

227
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:27,210
Of course, why shouldn't he be?

228
00:10:27,270 --> 00:10:30,210
He's never had to work for
anything in his entire life.

229
00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:31,530
Money and women
just seem to fall

230
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:35,070
into his big, fat, lucky lap.

231
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:37,110
So you resent him.

232
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:38,580
Oh, no, I love him.
He took me in

233
00:10:38,650 --> 00:10:40,080
when I needed
a place to live.

234
00:10:40,150 --> 00:10:41,950
Okay. You say
you love your brother,

235
00:10:42,010 --> 00:10:43,580
you're grateful for his help,

236
00:10:43,650 --> 00:10:46,950
and yet it must be difficult
to watch him sail through life

237
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:51,060
while you remain a complete
and utter failure.

238
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:55,320
I didn't say I was
a complete failure.

239
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:56,330
Huh.

240
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:59,670
Why is it in my notes?

241
00:10:59,730 --> 00:11:02,000
Anyway, continue.

242
00:11:02,070 --> 00:11:04,040
Okay.

243
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:06,600
Well, the worst part is

244
00:11:06,670 --> 00:11:09,540
that as selfish and promiscuous
as Charlie is,

245
00:11:09,610 --> 00:11:12,180
he hasn't suffered
any consequences.

246
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:16,020
No palimony suits, no bullet
wounds from angry husbands.

247
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:20,350
Not so much as a lousy
urinary tract infection.

248
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:22,180
And yet you love him.

249
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:23,400
Well, he's family.

250
00:11:24,690 --> 00:11:28,360
Oh... Oh, I get it.

251
00:11:28,430 --> 00:11:30,970
You think it's this
internal contradiction

252
00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:32,390
that's the source
of my insomnia.

253
00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:33,670
What do you think?

254
00:11:33,730 --> 00:11:36,330
I think you may be right.

255
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:37,700
But how do I resolve it?

256
00:11:37,770 --> 00:11:39,370
Well, that's a good question.

257
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,180
Unfortunately,
we're out of time.

258
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:42,500
Already?

259
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:45,080
You dozed off for
40 minutes, Alan.

260
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:46,470
You going to charge me for that?

261
00:11:46,550 --> 00:11:48,650
I was awake.

262
00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:52,480
All right, fine.
Can I write you a check?

263
00:11:52,550 --> 00:11:54,380
Oh, boy.

264
00:11:54,450 --> 00:11:57,050
Alan, you know, when a patient
tells me they're writing checks

265
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:01,220
they can't cover, I kind of have
a little cash only policy.

266
00:12:01,290 --> 00:12:04,690
All right,
where's the closest ATM?

267
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:06,160
Downstairs in the lobby.

268
00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:07,300
I'll be right back.

269
00:12:07,370 --> 00:12:11,280
I'll walk with you.

270
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:13,080
♪ Men.

271
00:12:17,310 --> 00:12:18,510
(computer chimes)

272
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:21,790
(chuckles)

273
00:12:21,850 --> 00:12:23,420
(computer chimes)

274
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:25,350
(chuckles)

275
00:12:28,390 --> 00:12:29,530
(computer chimes)

276
00:12:29,590 --> 00:12:31,500
(chuckles)

277
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:33,400
Hey.

278
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:34,460
What you doing?

279
00:12:34,530 --> 00:12:36,070
Chatting.

280
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:37,030
With who?

281
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:38,100
Each other.

282
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,530
But you're in the same room.

283
00:12:41,530 --> 00:12:42,730
(computer chimes)
(laughing)

284
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:46,500
What are you typing?
Is that about me?

285
00:12:46,570 --> 00:12:48,370
No.

286
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:50,410
(computer chimes)

287
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,280
Down the hall on the right.

288
00:12:52,350 --> 00:12:53,590
BRB.

289
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:59,160
"BRB"?

290
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:00,390
"Be right back."

291
00:13:00,450 --> 00:13:02,120
Ah.

292
00:13:02,190 --> 00:13:05,330
Well... YAD.

293
00:13:05,390 --> 00:13:06,420
What's that?

294
00:13:06,490 --> 00:13:08,360
You're a dog.

295
00:13:10,530 --> 00:13:11,690
She's cute.

296
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,460
She's just a friend.

297
00:13:13,530 --> 00:13:17,370
R-R-R-uff.

298
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:18,480
What are you doing?

299
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:20,550
Oh, come on, it's me
you're talking to.

300
00:13:20,610 --> 00:13:21,580
The big dog.

301
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:25,370
(howling)

302
00:13:25,450 --> 00:13:27,390
You're starting
to freak me out.

303
00:13:27,450 --> 00:13:28,490
(doorbell rings)

304
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:30,460
GIRL:
That's my mom.

305
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:31,820
I'll get it.

306
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:33,720
Okay, okay, I lied—
I like her.

307
00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:35,130
Oh, really?

308
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:38,430
Yeah. Woof.

309
00:13:38,490 --> 00:13:39,790
There you go.

310
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:41,970
Wait, don't open the door.

311
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:43,670
Why not?
(doorbell ringing)

312
00:13:43,730 --> 00:13:44,890
Coming.

313
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:46,790
Go to your room.

314
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:47,870
What are you nuts?

315
00:13:47,930 --> 00:13:49,700
Please don't hit on her.

316
00:13:49,770 --> 00:13:50,640
Hit on who?

317
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:51,830
Taylor's mom.

318
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:53,700
Why would I hit
on Taylor's mom?

319
00:13:53,770 --> 00:13:55,070
Well, because
she's kind of pretty,

320
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:57,940
and you'll hit on
anything with a pulse.

321
00:13:58,010 --> 00:13:59,940
Where'd you get that?

322
00:14:00,010 --> 00:14:01,010
My mom.

323
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:02,110
Oh, well...

324
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:04,780
And my dad, Berta,
Rose, Grandma...

325
00:14:04,850 --> 00:14:05,950
Okay, okay.

326
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:07,690
The UPS man...

327
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:09,420
All right.

328
00:14:09,490 --> 00:14:10,630
And when you hit on
people I know,

329
00:14:10,690 --> 00:14:11,850
everything gets screwed up

330
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,690
where I have to find
a new guitar teacher,

331
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:15,190
a new karate class,
Cub Scout troop...

332
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:16,660
Okay, okay, I get it.

333
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:17,800
godmother.

334
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:20,060
You don't have
to worry.

335
00:14:20,130 --> 00:14:22,730
I'm not going to risk
our friendship over
"kind of pretty."

336
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:23,900
So you won't
hit on her?

337
00:14:23,970 --> 00:14:25,730
Absolutely not.

338
00:14:27,810 --> 00:14:30,620
Hi. I'm Taylor's mom.

339
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:33,080
Scratch that.

340
00:14:39,850 --> 00:14:41,580
Great. Bye.

341
00:14:48,530 --> 00:14:49,870
You promised.

342
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:52,900
No, no. No, no. The head
that made the promise

343
00:14:52,970 --> 00:14:54,870
is not the one that broke it.

344
00:14:57,570 --> 00:15:00,540
And besides, you said she
was just kind of pretty?

345
00:15:00,610 --> 00:15:01,710
Who do you
consider hot?

346
00:15:01,770 --> 00:15:03,270
Taylor.

347
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:04,810
Taylor's 12.

348
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,920
Hello?

349
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:09,250
Come on, what's the worst thing
that could happen

350
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:11,460
if I go out with your
little friend's mom?

351
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:13,320
Do I have to explain
it to you again?

352
00:15:13,390 --> 00:15:15,160
My guitar teacher,
my karate coach...

353
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:16,480
Okay, okay.

354
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:19,700
I can't show my face
at the comic book store.

355
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:22,770
All right, but the worst thing
doesn't have to happen.

356
00:15:22,830 --> 00:15:25,740
Would you please just
not go out with her?

357
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:29,210
Tell you what—
I'll make you a deal.

358
00:15:29,270 --> 00:15:30,710
I'll give up Taylor's mom
in exchange

359
00:15:30,770 --> 00:15:33,500
for you washing my car
once a week for the next month.

360
00:15:33,570 --> 00:15:34,840
Done.

361
00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:36,410
That includes Turtle Wax,
tire dressing

362
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,350
and vacuuming the carpets.
Oh, man.

363
00:15:38,410 --> 00:15:39,870
Hey, hey, hey, hey, the woman
is recently divorced.

364
00:15:39,950 --> 00:15:41,690
I didn't ask for her number,
she gave it to me.

365
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:43,660
Do you know what that means?
No.

366
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:46,790
That means one, maybe two
dinners, and...

367
00:15:48,350 --> 00:15:50,490
You're waxing my car.

368
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:53,300
All right.

369
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:56,730
You're lucky you're not
painting the house.

370
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:59,770
The sacrifices we make
for our kids.

371
00:15:59,830 --> 00:16:01,730
Hey.

372
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,870
Hey.

373
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:05,340
You look like crap.

374
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:07,700
Thank you.
You look terrific.

375
00:16:07,770 --> 00:16:09,500
I feel terrific.

376
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:10,920
The key is a good night's sleep.

377
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:12,750
Yeah, listen, uh,

378
00:16:12,810 --> 00:16:14,510
I have to talk to you.

379
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:16,740
This is a bad
time, Alan.
How come?

380
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:18,360
Because you want
to talk to me.

381
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:20,990
Okay, what?

382
00:16:21,050 --> 00:16:23,520
Uh, you know I love you, right?

383
00:16:23,590 --> 00:16:26,690
Alan, are you
breaking up with me?

384
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:29,530
Would you just shut up
and listen to me?

385
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,400
Pick one, Alan.

386
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:35,530
All right, all right,
I talked to a therapist.

387
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:39,770
And I think
I learned something.

388
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:42,410
Nah, too easy.
Go ahead.

389
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,650
The thing is...

390
00:16:44,710 --> 00:16:47,740
all these years of watching
your life go so smoothly,

391
00:16:47,810 --> 00:16:49,510
while I stumble back and forth

392
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:51,980
between humiliation
and abject failure,

393
00:16:52,050 --> 00:16:54,780
has resulted in me harboring
a lot of anger

394
00:16:54,850 --> 00:16:56,280
and jealousy towards you.

395
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:57,660
Yeah, I get that.

396
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:00,420
How could it not?

397
00:17:00,490 --> 00:17:04,790
Anyway, I think the tension
between my love for you

398
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:07,600
and my resentment of you
is what's causing my insomnia.

399
00:17:07,670 --> 00:17:09,540
And?

400
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:11,770
And I thought maybe if
I got it out in the open,

401
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:12,840
it might help me sleep.

402
00:17:12,910 --> 00:17:14,710
So how do you feel now?

403
00:17:14,770 --> 00:17:16,840
Better, actually.

404
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:18,920
Like... like a weight
has been lifted.

405
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:20,520
Well, good.

406
00:17:20,580 --> 00:17:21,780
Yeah, maybe that's it.

407
00:17:21,850 --> 00:17:23,620
Maybe all I needed to do
was unload.

408
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:27,750
Well, a good unloading
usually makes me drowsy.

409
00:17:27,820 --> 00:17:28,920
You're disgusting.

410
00:17:28,990 --> 00:17:30,330
True...

411
00:17:30,390 --> 00:17:33,300
but I sleep
like a baby.

412
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:34,970
And if I wake up fussy,

413
00:17:35,030 --> 00:17:37,800
there's always something
nearby to put in my mouth.

414
00:17:40,770 --> 00:17:43,810
♪ Men.

415
00:17:43,870 --> 00:17:45,800
(whistling tune)

416
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:04,730
I waxed your car.

417
00:18:04,790 --> 00:18:06,820
What? What are you doing up?

418
00:18:06,890 --> 00:18:09,460
You were out with Taylor's mom,
weren't you?

419
00:18:09,530 --> 00:18:10,570
No, I wasn't.

420
00:18:10,630 --> 00:18:11,830
Are you sure?

421
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:13,940
I think I know
who I was out with.

422
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,660
Okay, well, maybe you
can explain this picture

423
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:19,480
of your perfectly waxed
car in Taylor's driveway.

424
00:18:20,970 --> 00:18:22,640
Where the hell'd you get that?

425
00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:25,780
Taylor took it with her phone
and e-mailed it to me.

426
00:18:25,850 --> 00:18:27,820
Oh, okay.

427
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:30,280
Not my car.

428
00:18:30,350 --> 00:18:31,890
What about this one of you

429
00:18:31,950 --> 00:18:33,750
kissing Taylor's mom
in front of the car?

430
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:37,820
Um...

431
00:18:37,890 --> 00:18:38,790
Photoshop.

432
00:18:40,530 --> 00:18:41,570
How was your date?

433
00:18:41,630 --> 00:18:42,830
Very nice.

434
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:44,970
Bite me.

435
00:18:46,970 --> 00:18:48,670
Okay, well, good night.

436
00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:50,680
You said you wouldn't
go out with her and you did.

437
00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:52,840
I had to, Jake.

438
00:18:52,910 --> 00:18:53,980
She called me.

439
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:55,670
What difference does that make?

440
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:57,440
I have to explain it to you?

441
00:18:57,510 --> 00:18:59,850
I have to explain
everything to you.

442
00:18:59,910 --> 00:19:02,310
Okay, okay.

443
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:04,750
Let's say you're a hunter.

444
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:08,430
If a deer takes your gun,
shoots itself,

445
00:19:08,490 --> 00:19:11,700
then straps itself
to the roof of your car,

446
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:14,900
you have to take it home
and eat it.

447
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:17,660
What?

448
00:19:17,730 --> 00:19:19,030
I'm sorry.

449
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:21,710
I can't make it any clearer.

450
00:19:21,770 --> 00:19:24,710
If you keep seeing her, Uncle
Charlie, you're gonna be sorry.

451
00:19:24,770 --> 00:19:26,500
Whoa.

452
00:19:26,570 --> 00:19:27,530
Is that a threat?

453
00:19:27,610 --> 00:19:28,710
No, it's a promise.

454
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:30,610
What's the difference?

455
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:33,720
I don't know— one's a threat
and one's a promise.

456
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:35,780
(sighs)

457
00:19:35,850 --> 00:19:38,590
Oh, come on, buddy,
let's be reasonable here.

458
00:19:38,650 --> 00:19:40,720
Your relationship with
your little friend is what,

459
00:19:40,790 --> 00:19:43,530
instant messaging and holding
hands at the pep rally?

460
00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:44,960
What's a pep rally?

461
00:19:45,020 --> 00:19:46,820
Just listen to me.

462
00:19:46,890 --> 00:19:49,520
Before you know it, you'll have
forgotten all about Taylor.

463
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,370
And you'll have forgotten
all about her mother.

464
00:19:51,430 --> 00:19:53,460
No doubt.

465
00:19:53,530 --> 00:19:55,800
But I guarantee you
I'll be forgetting a lot more

466
00:19:55,870 --> 00:19:57,840
than holding her hand
at a pep rally.

467
00:19:57,900 --> 00:19:59,800
Last chance, Uncle Charlie.

468
00:20:00,910 --> 00:20:03,920
Ooh, I'm so scared.

469
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:07,790
(mocking):
Last chance, Uncle Charlie.

470
00:20:07,850 --> 00:20:09,850
(scoffs)
Please.

471
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:20,700
CHARLIE:
Jake...!

472
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:21,920
What's going on?

473
00:20:21,990 --> 00:20:23,160
Nothing.
Got to go.

474
00:20:23,230 --> 00:20:24,940
You're dead.

475
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,640
You are so dead!

476
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:28,760

477
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:29,970

478
00:20:31,770 --> 00:20:32,970
Damn it.

479
00:20:42,650 --> 00:20:44,590
He went that way.

480
00:20:47,850 --> 00:20:50,720
Great slime.

481
00:20:50,790 --> 00:20:51,750
Thanks.

482
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:55,060
It's an old family recipe.

483
00:20:55,130 --> 00:20:58,800
Where are you, you rat bastard?

484
00:20:58,870 --> 00:21:01,440
MAN (over speaker):
This is the Los Angeles
Sheriff's Department!

485
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:04,130
Get down on the sand
with your arms spread!

486
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:05,530
It's okay!

487
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:08,100
I'm just trying to kill a kid!

488
00:21:08,170 --> 00:21:11,670
Release the dogs!
