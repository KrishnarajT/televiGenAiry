1
00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:04,420
Yo, dude, what up?

2
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:07,130
Just follow my lead.

3
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:10,490
Oh, this is awesome.

4
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:13,130
Eh, it's just
a little surf shack

5
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:15,370
where I keep my board,
beer and brother.

6
00:00:16,870 --> 00:00:21,210
How they breakin' today,
Bro-heim?

7
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:24,700
How are what breaking?

8
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:27,020
He smokes way
too much weed.

9
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:30,050
The waves, Poindexter.

10
00:00:30,110 --> 00:00:32,080
Oh, oh, the waves...

11
00:00:32,150 --> 00:00:34,760
the waves are...

12
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:37,160
knarly?

13
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:39,180
Well, all right, let's hit it.

14
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:43,230
Oh, I intend to.

15
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:44,560
Why don't you head out.
I'll throw on my suit

16
00:00:44,630 --> 00:00:47,170
and meet you there.
Awesome.

17
00:00:50,530 --> 00:00:54,130
Mm, bodacious and tubular.

18
00:00:56,610 --> 00:00:58,450
Uh, excuse
me, Moon Doggie—

19
00:00:58,510 --> 00:01:00,150
quick question.

20
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:01,170
Yeah.

21
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:02,710
You don't surf, do you?

22
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:04,480
Not a bit.

23
00:01:04,550 --> 00:01:08,060
So how did Gidget get the idea
you were the Big Kahuna?

24
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:09,220
I hold her I hang ten,

25
00:01:09,290 --> 00:01:11,130
and I guess she
misunderstood.

26
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:14,100
You're going to Hell, you know.

27
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:15,530
I don't think so.

28
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:18,090
I believe in a loving God
who forgives little fibs

29
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:20,260
as long as they lead
to recreational sex.

30
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:23,060
You really want to drag
God into this?

31
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:26,560
Who gave me
the penis, Alan?

32
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,780
Since when do you
have a wet suit?

33
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:30,810
Since I moved
to the beach

34
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:33,110
and noticed it was full
of hot surfer chicks.

35
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:38,240
If I lived next
to Jellystone Park,

36
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:41,390
I'd have a bear suit
and a "pic-a-nic" basket.

37
00:01:43,390 --> 00:01:44,430
Would you get the door?

38
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:47,460
(glass breaking)

39
00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:50,730
Oopsie.

40
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:52,560
Smooth.

41
00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:54,400
So just out
of curiosity,

42
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:57,430
how exactly do you plan
to pull this off?

43
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:59,630
Simple—
paddle out,

44
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:02,200
yell "shark"
and paddle in.

45
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:03,570
So you've thought this through?

46
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:05,440
I'm not an idiot.

47
00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:08,220
(glass breaking)

48
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:10,220
Whoopsie.

49
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:14,460
Over here.

50
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:17,130
What happened?

51
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:18,660
I don't know.
(coughing)

52
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:19,650
This tiny wave
came at us,

53
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:21,190
I let it go.

54
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:22,800
He screamed like a girl
and fell off his board.

55
00:02:24,290 --> 00:02:25,890
I had to give him
mouth-to-mouth,

56
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:27,560
he swallowed
a lot of water.

57
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:29,360
He's going to be okay?

58
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:30,700
I think so.

59
00:02:30,770 --> 00:02:32,210
He tried slipping
me the tongue.

60
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:35,800
Charlie, can you hear me?
(coughing)

61
00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:39,610
Sha...

62
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:40,380
What?

63
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:42,340
Sha...

64
00:02:42,410 --> 00:02:44,240
I think he's trying
to say shark."

00:02:57,190 --> 00:02:59,020
Want something to drink?

69
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:00,940
Oh, yeah.

70
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:06,830
Ugh.

71
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:08,100
What is this?

72
00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:09,470
Water.

73
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:12,050
Are you crazy?
I almost drowned in that stuff.

74
00:03:16,850 --> 00:03:18,950
Where's my
little hard body?

75
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:21,390
He took off with that girl
you brought home.

76
00:03:24,490 --> 00:03:26,960
Other than that, your plan
worked like a charm.

77
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:29,420
Fine. Go ahead and mock me.

78
00:03:29,490 --> 00:03:31,420
But I could
have died out there.

79
00:03:31,490 --> 00:03:34,160
Well the sea is
a harsh mistress.

80
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:37,060
And... you're a moron.

81
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:41,370
What? You said to mock you.

82
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,510
It's no joke, Alan.

83
00:03:42,570 --> 00:03:44,300
Oh, come on.

84
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:46,100
You tried to scam your way
into a surf bunny's shorts

85
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:49,320
and ended up French kissing
a handsome young lifeguard.

86
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:51,420
How is that not a joke?

87
00:03:53,450 --> 00:03:55,410
It's not a joke, because...

88
00:03:57,420 --> 00:04:00,850
Something happened out there
while I was drowning.

89
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:03,420
What, did your entire sordid,
degenerate life

90
00:04:03,490 --> 00:04:05,190
flash before your eyes?

91
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:07,430
I wish.

92
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:09,970
No, no, no.

93
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:11,460
It was...

94
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:13,230
Oh, you're not
going to believe me.

95
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:14,830
Try me.

96
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:18,470
I saw Dad.

97
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:20,510
Oh, baloney.

98
00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:22,280
You know what?

99
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:23,520
Just forget it.

100
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:25,110
Oh, come on, it was
probably just

101
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:27,180
a hallucination
caused by, you know,

102
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:28,880
brain cells dying.

103
00:04:30,890 --> 00:04:32,830
No, I'm used to that.

104
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:37,520
This was no hallucination.

105
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:39,960
Dad was right there
in the water with me.

106
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:42,230
All right, all right,
for the sake of argument

107
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:43,940
let's assume that you saw

108
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,830
the spirit of
our dead father.

109
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:47,470
What did he do,
reach a hand out

110
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:49,380
to guide you to
the great beyond?

111
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,280
Don't be ridiculous.

112
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:53,870
He didn't have hands.

113
00:04:55,450 --> 00:04:59,550
It was just his head
kind of floating there

114
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:02,990
like the great, powerful Oz.

115
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:07,850
Or one of the Pep Boys.

116
00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:10,530
Wow.

117
00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:12,620
Manny, Moe or Jack?

118
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:14,170
Jack.

119
00:05:15,930 --> 00:05:19,130
And he spoke to me.

120
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:21,070
Oh, oh, you were
able to hear him

121
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:22,040
underwater?

122
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:23,380
How weird.

123
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,500
Oh, that's the part
that bumps you?

124
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:28,180
I'm just saying
that you were able to hear him

125
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:29,350
because you were
imagining it.

126
00:05:29,410 --> 00:05:30,480
It was in your head.

127
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:32,090
No. Oh, no.

128
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:33,460
In a million years my mind

129
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:36,020
could not have made up
what he said to me.

130
00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:37,290
What'd he say?

131
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:38,950
(sighs)

132
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:41,520
Something that made
my blood run cold.

133
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:43,020
What?

134
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:45,300
Never mind.

135
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,890
I probably heard him wrong.

136
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:49,560
Charlie...
Please don't
make me say it.

137
00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:51,530
Come on, Charlie,
I am your brother.

138
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,100
Whatever it was, we'll
deal with it together.

139
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:59,080
He said...

140
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:01,310
"Take care of your mother."

141
00:06:06,650 --> 00:06:08,520
Good luck with that.

142
00:06:10,650 --> 00:06:12,520
♪ Men. ♪

143
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:15,700
Hey.

144
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:17,530
Hey.

145
00:06:17,590 --> 00:06:19,920
Dad said
you almost drowned today.

146
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,640
Yep.

147
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:23,310
Are you okay now?

148
00:06:23,370 --> 00:06:25,210
I'm fine.

149
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:26,540
Can I ask you a question?

150
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,270
Sure.

151
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:30,380
It's about what happens
when you die.

152
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:31,700
Okay.

153
00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:34,040
Who gets your car?

154
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:38,550
Go away.

155
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:41,520
You're right.
Not a good
time to ask.

156
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:47,520
So, what you doing?

157
00:06:47,590 --> 00:06:49,720
Thinking
about Dad.

158
00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:52,560
Yeah, about that,

159
00:06:52,630 --> 00:06:55,540
I was wondering,
when you saw him,

160
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:57,640
assuming you saw him,

161
00:06:57,700 --> 00:07:00,630
did he... ask about me?

162
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:02,570
No.

163
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:05,250
He just said,
"Take are of your mother."

164
00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:06,710
Huh.

165
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:08,420
Didn't... didn't mention
me at all?

166
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:09,650
Nope.

167
00:07:09,710 --> 00:07:11,540
Typical.

168
00:07:11,610 --> 00:07:13,450
Oh, here we go.

169
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:14,990
I'm just saying,

170
00:07:15,050 --> 00:07:16,550
the guy doesn't get
in touch for 30 years—

171
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:19,260
it wouldn't kill him
to throw in a quick,
"Hello, Alan."

172
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:21,590
Dead or alive,
that's just rude.

173
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:22,730
Tell you what.

174
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:24,520
Why don't you go
fill up the tub,

175
00:07:24,590 --> 00:07:25,560
I'll hold your head
under the water

176
00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:27,240
till the bubbles stop,

177
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:29,340
and then you can tell him
how offended you are.

178
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:32,710
Oh, no. I have nothing
to say to him now.

179
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:39,050
How does he expect me
to take care of her?

180
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:40,550
I don't know.

181
00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:42,610
Why don't you try
treating her like
a human being?

182
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:46,550
Nah, that can't be it.

183
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:49,090
What if I put her in
an assisted-living facility?

184
00:07:49,150 --> 00:07:51,650
That's ridiculous.
She's a healthy woman.

185
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:54,150
I'm not saying she wouldn't
put up a fight.

186
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:56,590
But hey, crumble up
a few Xanax in her mimosa

187
00:07:56,660 --> 00:08:00,070
and we could probably coax her
into a cave full of bats.

188
00:08:00,130 --> 00:08:02,690
I don't think
that's what Dad meant.

189
00:08:02,770 --> 00:08:04,470
How do you know?

190
00:08:04,530 --> 00:08:05,560
Did he talk to you?

191
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:07,580
No, he talked to me.

192
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:10,250
Sure, rub my nose in it.

193
00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:11,710
How about this—

194
00:08:11,770 --> 00:08:13,570
when was the last time
you called her

195
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:15,070
just to see how she was doing?

196
00:08:15,150 --> 00:08:18,750
Uh... what's today, Sunday?

197
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:20,590
Then never.

198
00:08:20,650 --> 00:08:24,450
Why don't you
start with that?

199
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:27,250
Okay. Fine.

200
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:28,750
Remember her number?

201
00:08:28,830 --> 00:08:30,600
I've got it
on speed dial.

202
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:32,760
6-6-6.

203
00:08:32,830 --> 00:08:34,770
Cute, huh?

204
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,180
Hey, Mom, it's Charlie.

205
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,540
Nothing's the matter.

206
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,600
I just called to see
how you're doing.

207
00:08:43,670 --> 00:08:46,140
No, I'm not drunk.

208
00:08:46,210 --> 00:08:47,420
I was just thinking
about you,

209
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:49,120
and I thought I'd call.

210
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:51,590
I swear to God
I'm not drunk.

211
00:08:51,650 --> 00:08:54,220
Peter Piper picked a peck
of pickled peppers.

212
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:56,080
You happy?

213
00:08:56,150 --> 00:08:57,780
So what's going on?

214
00:08:57,850 --> 00:09:00,190
I haven't talked
to you in awhi...

215
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:03,730
Well, I'm talking
to you now.

216
00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:09,430
Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.

217
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:11,540
Excuse me?

218
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,800
Okay. Okay. Okay.

219
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:18,680
So... everything okay?

220
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:21,870
I'm taking her
to lunch tomorrow.

221
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:23,680
Voluntarily?

222
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:28,190
Wow, you must have really had a
spiritual experience out there.

223
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:29,610
Let's face it, Alan,

224
00:09:29,690 --> 00:09:32,590
when Dad was alive,
I was a rotten son.

225
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:33,730
Oh, you sure were.

226
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:35,220
You were horrible.

227
00:09:35,290 --> 00:09:36,290
Boy, I remember the time...

228
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:38,230
The point is...

229
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:41,300
maybe I've got a chance
to make up for it now.

230
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,300
He wants me to take care
of Mom,

231
00:09:43,370 --> 00:09:44,740
then that's what
we're going to do.

232
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,660
Well, that-that's gr...

233
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:48,610
Wait a minute,
did you say "we"?

234
00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:49,800
I'm not going.

235
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:51,470
Fine.

236
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:53,240
Next time I see our father's
floating head,

237
00:09:53,310 --> 00:09:55,240
I'm going to tell him
you refused to help.

238
00:09:55,310 --> 00:09:57,810
(mocking tone):
I'm going to tell him,
I'm going to tell him.

239
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:59,580
God, you're
such a child.

240
00:09:59,650 --> 00:10:01,620
So you're coming?
Yeah.

241
00:10:03,950 --> 00:10:06,420
I can't tell you
what a treat it is

242
00:10:06,490 --> 00:10:08,760
to have lunch with my
two favorite sons.

243
00:10:08,830 --> 00:10:10,570
You have others?

244
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:13,740
It's an expression, Charlie.

245
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,800
Although I do sponsor
a little boy in Africa.

246
00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:16,870
No kidding?

247
00:10:16,930 --> 00:10:19,230
Oh, yes. Little Mobutu.

248
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:21,700
He's in the middle
of a civil war,

249
00:10:21,770 --> 00:10:23,670
and I still hear from him
more than you.

250
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:28,220
Hey, Alan, tell Mom what that
little rascal Jake's been up to.

251
00:10:29,810 --> 00:10:31,840
He hasn't been up to anything.

252
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:37,420
Okay.

253
00:10:37,490 --> 00:10:38,530
So...

254
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:42,600
I think I'll go
to the bathroom.

255
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:43,870
Why?

256
00:10:43,930 --> 00:10:46,300
What do you mean why?
I have to go.

257
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:48,760
When was the last time you had
a prostate exam?

258
00:10:48,830 --> 00:10:50,560
Feels like I'm having one now.

259
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:52,660
I'm just expressing concern
for your health.

260
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:54,580
You don't have to get snippy.

261
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,240
I'm not being snippy.

262
00:10:56,310 --> 00:10:58,680
Is it just me,
or is he snippy?

263
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:01,320
Try living with him.

264
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:03,290
Excuse me.

265
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:04,750
All right,
what's going on?

266
00:11:04,810 --> 00:11:06,640
What makes you think
something's going on?

267
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:09,960
When one of my sons
calls me for no reason

268
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:11,560
and agrees to take
me to lunch,

269
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:13,550
something heinous
is going on.

270
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:15,390
Hey, I took you to lunch
two weeks ago

271
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:17,230
for no reason other
than I love you.

272
00:11:17,290 --> 00:11:20,630
Oh, yes, the tacky little chain
restaurant in the Valley.

273
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:23,510
That fish shot out of me
like there was a fire drill.

274
00:11:23,570 --> 00:11:27,510
The point is I love you.

275
00:11:27,570 --> 00:11:30,870
The point is I lost
four pounds in two days.

276
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:33,870
Well, you do look thinner.

277
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:35,910
It's too late for
flattery, darling.

278
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:38,350
Now what is going on
with your brother?

279
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:41,560
I don't think he'd be very happy
with me if I told you.

280
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:44,530
Sweetheart, you're not
his favorite person now.

281
00:11:44,590 --> 00:11:45,560
(sighs)

282
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:47,850
Okay, here's the thing.

283
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:51,420
Charlie almost drowned
yesterday.

284
00:11:51,490 --> 00:11:52,760
Oh, dear Lord,

285
00:11:52,830 --> 00:11:53,970
I've told him over
and over again

286
00:11:54,030 --> 00:11:56,590
two drinks max
in the hot tub.

287
00:11:56,670 --> 00:11:58,340
No, he was surfing.

288
00:11:58,400 --> 00:11:58,960
In the hot tub?

289
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,780
In the ocean.

290
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:02,440
Start again.

291
00:12:02,510 --> 00:12:04,750
He was trying to impress
some girl.

292
00:12:04,810 --> 00:12:05,880
Ah, oh, okay.

293
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:07,310
Like the time he
broke his nose

294
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:08,320
playing tetherball.

295
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:09,720
Exactly.

296
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:13,990
Anyway, he was convinced
he was near death

297
00:12:14,050 --> 00:12:16,450
and that he saw Dad.

298
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:18,790
He saw your father?

299
00:12:20,390 --> 00:12:21,290
Wow.

300
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:23,920
How'd he look?

301
00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:26,490
Uh, he was just kind of
a floating head.

302
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:28,790
Yeah, that's pretty
much how I remember him.

303
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:31,470
Fairly useless
from the neck down.

304
00:12:31,530 --> 00:12:35,830
Anyway, Dad told Charlie
to take care of you.

305
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:40,810
Really?

306
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,320
Anything else?

307
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:43,520
Nope, that's it.

308
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:45,010
Just for him
to take care of you.

309
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:47,480
It's like I might as well
not even exist.

310
00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:50,050
Oh, Alan, you can't
take that personally.

311
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:52,860
First of all, Charlie
was a planned baby.

312
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:54,820
What was I?

313
00:12:54,890 --> 00:12:56,890
Well, dear, you were
a pitcher of margaritas

314
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:59,400
and a gas station condom.

315
00:13:02,530 --> 00:13:05,430
I had a nice solid
stream of urine,

316
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:06,600
thank you very much.

317
00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:07,940
What?

318
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,930
My prostate is fine.

319
00:13:10,010 --> 00:13:11,580
What kind of table talk is that?

320
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:12,900
You're the one
that brought it up.

321
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:14,680
It doesn't matter
who brought it up.

322
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:16,740
I don't want to hear
about it when I'm eating.

323
00:13:16,810 --> 00:13:18,840
You know what?

324
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:20,660
This lunch was a bad idea.

325
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:21,890
No, don't say that, darling.

326
00:13:21,950 --> 00:13:23,750
It was a wonderful idea.

327
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:26,120
If I'm being ungracious,
I apologize.

328
00:13:26,190 --> 00:13:29,000
All right, let's call it
"ungracious,"

329
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:30,900
but we all know
what we're thinking.

330
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:36,390
I guess I'm just
a little edgy because, well...

331
00:13:38,130 --> 00:13:39,500
No, never mind.

332
00:13:39,570 --> 00:13:40,740
What?

333
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:43,840
Forget it. My problems
are my problems.

334
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:47,720
I don't expect you
to take care of me.

335
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:52,920
Mom, just for the
sake of argument,

336
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:56,650
let's say that I wanted
to take care of you.

337
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:57,120
What's going on?

338
00:13:57,190 --> 00:13:58,790
Nothing.

339
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:02,160
I'm just having a little minor
surgery tomorrow.

340
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:03,590
What kind of surgery?

341
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:04,920
It's a woman thing.

342
00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:06,020
Is there anything I can do?

343
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:08,970
Just keep me in your prayers.

344
00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:10,390
No, no, no.

345
00:14:10,470 --> 00:14:11,870
I will drive you there

346
00:14:11,930 --> 00:14:14,830
and then take you back to my
place so you can recuperate.

347
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:17,540
Oh, sweetheart,
that's very generous,

348
00:14:17,610 --> 00:14:18,980
but I don't want
to be a burden.

349
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:22,810
Mom, please,
that ship has sailed.

350
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:26,420
Well, then I accept.

351
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:27,750
Thank you.

352
00:14:32,150 --> 00:14:34,650
Who buys condoms
at a gas station?

353
00:14:36,930 --> 00:14:37,930
♪ Men. ♪

354
00:14:42,130 --> 00:14:43,190
Watch your step here.

355
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:55,570
Thank you, darling.

356
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:04,760
What happened to your mouth?

357
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:07,180
I just had a little procedure.

358
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:09,030
What kind of procedure?

359
00:15:09,090 --> 00:15:12,760
They sucked some fat out of her
ass and shot it into her lips.

360
00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:19,900
What did they do,
use the whole ass?

361
00:15:19,970 --> 00:15:21,840
They're just a little swollen.

362
