1
00:00:03,650 --> 00:00:05,820
you want to go out
and grab some dinner?

2
00:00:05,890 --> 00:00:07,900
I can't go out
to dinner, Charlie.

3
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:09,500
Why not?
You got a date?

4
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:10,860
He said, knowing
the answer,

5
00:00:10,930 --> 00:00:13,470
but asking anyway,
just to be polite.

6
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:15,930
No, I don't have a date, he
replied, all the while thinking,

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,570
"Bite me,
you booze-addled buffoon."

8
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:21,010
So why can't you go?

9
00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:22,670
Are you kidding?

10
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:24,740
I'm paying alimony
to two women.

11
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:26,980
I don't have money for luxuries
like eating out.

12
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:29,710
Or eating in, really.

13
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:32,110
I'm trying to learn
to chew my own cud.

14
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:34,010
It's all right, I'll treat.

15
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:35,950
No, no, no, you've done
too much for me already.

16
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:39,800
Yeah, but it's not like
I'm keeping a tab... $26,382.

17
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:43,590
To date.

18
00:00:43,660 --> 00:00:47,060
Exactly, so I need to start
carrying my own weight,

19
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:50,700
which is actually getting easier
now that I'm wasting away.

20
00:00:50,770 --> 00:00:52,910
Oh, stop feeling
sorry for yourself.

21
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:54,170
I'm not feeling
sorry for myself.

22
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:55,840
I'll find something
here to eat.

23
00:00:55,910 --> 00:00:59,720
Maybe some scrambled eggs
and a Popsicle.

24
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:01,220
Fine. See ya later.

25
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:04,910
(sighs)

26
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:12,090
All right, I'm only going
to ask you one more time.

27
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:14,230
Would you like
to have dinner with me?

28
00:01:14,290 --> 00:01:16,190
That depends.
Where are we going?

29
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:18,130
Oh, for God's sake!

30
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,840
What, what,
I don't even get a vote?

31
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:22,000
No, you don't get a vote.
You get a free meal.

32
00:01:22,070 --> 00:01:24,940
Well, if I was one of
your dates, you'd ask
where I wanted to go.

33
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:27,970
You're right.

34
00:01:31,070 --> 00:01:33,870
(sexy voice):
So where to do you
want to go, baby?

35
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:35,170
That's uh, that's very funny.

36
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:37,150
Oh, no, no, let's get
something hot in you

37
00:01:37,210 --> 00:01:39,610
and then get
something hot in you.

38
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,480
Knock it off.

39
00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:43,080
Gee, you smell good.

40
00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:44,950
You know what, you
know what? Okay, okay.

41
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:46,650
I'll just stay here
and have a Popsicle.

42
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,050
Oh, you'll be getting
a Popsicle.

43
00:01:48,130 --> 00:01:49,100
Fine, fine, okay.

44
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:50,630
You pick the restaurant.

45
00:01:50,690 --> 00:01:52,090
Thank you. How about sushi?

46
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:54,130
Ew, not a big fan.

47
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,940
(doorbell ringing)

48
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,140
Oh, that's Judith.

49
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,160
Keep thinking.

50
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:03,280
Jake, your mother's here.

51
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,970
Hey, that Popsicle almost...

52
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:19,960
Hello.

53
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:22,020
Hi. Yeah, he'll
be right out.

54
00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:24,160
Do me a favor
and take 'em both.

55
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:28,070
Hey, Mom.

56
00:02:28,130 --> 00:02:30,530
Hey, honey, would you wait
in the car, please?

57
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,230
Who's in trouble—
me or Dad?

58
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:33,300
No one's in trouble.

59
00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:34,800
It's you.

60
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:39,040
Judith, if you're going
to chew my ass off,

61
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:40,280
just know, I'm
planning on having it

62
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:42,140
for breakfast tomorrow.

63
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:45,240
No, you didn't
do anything, Alan.

64
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:46,920
I just, um...

65
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:49,080
I wanted to let you know
that, uh...

66
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:50,950
Boy, this is awkward.

67
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:53,220
You remember that I was dating
Jake's pediatrician?

68
00:02:53,290 --> 00:02:55,850
Yeah, yeah, Melnick.
What about him?

69
00:02:55,930 --> 00:02:57,870
Well, we started seeing
each other again,

70
00:02:57,930 --> 00:02:59,270
and it's gotten serious.

71
00:02:59,330 --> 00:03:01,240
Oh. How serious?

72
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:04,870
He asked me to marry him,
and I said yes.

73
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:08,980
Oh. Wow.

74
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:11,880
I... I don't know
what to say.

75
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:13,770
Um, I guess congratulations.

76
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,240
Thank you.

77
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:17,080
Just wanted to let you know
before we told Jake.

78
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:19,690
Sure, sure, I appreciate it.

79
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:21,080
It's kind of weird,
isn't it?

80
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:23,150
I mean, we spent
so many years together.

81
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:25,720
It's hard for me to think of
you married to somebody else.

82
00:03:25,790 --> 00:03:27,260
Yeah.

83
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:32,660
Still, I wish you
the best, though.

84
00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:34,030
Oh, I know you do.

85
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:35,200
Thank you.

86
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,030
Well, bye.

87
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:39,100
Bye.

88
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:50,720

97
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:30,820
You mean besides
eating it with you?

98
00:04:30,890 --> 00:04:33,830
It's all fleshy and flappy
and wet.

99
00:04:33,890 --> 00:04:36,320
Feels unnatural
against my tongue.

100
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:37,990
Al...
What?

101
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:40,190
I think I know why your
marriages didn't work out.

102
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,770
Oh, stop it.

103
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:46,030
Now, speaking
of marriages,

104
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:47,700
the next time we go
out to dinner,

105
00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:49,030
it'll be on me,

106
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:51,210
because with Judith
getting married again...

107
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:53,240
I'll have...

108
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:55,010
(monotone):
Five, six, seven, eight...

109
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:57,420
♪ No more alimony,
No more alimony ♪

110
00:04:57,480 --> 00:05:00,280
♪ No more alimo...

111
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:02,110
Hey, Dad.

112
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:03,430
What are you doing here?

113
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:04,830
And how'd you get in?

114
00:05:04,890 --> 00:05:06,260
Rose let me in.

115
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,790
Hey, guys.

116
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:09,970
How was dinner?

117
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:11,230
Forget dinner.

118
00:05:11,290 --> 00:05:12,120
What are you doing here?

119
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:14,000
Keeping Jake company.

120
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:17,760
But if you let him in, you had
to have been here before him.

121
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,470
Well, yeah.

122
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:21,280
But if Jake hadn't shown up,

123
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:24,780
I'd be gone by now,
and you'd never know I was here.

124
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:27,270
So what, you just waltz in
and make yourself at home

125
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:28,440
whenever I'm out?

126
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:30,280
That's not true.

127
00:05:30,350 --> 00:05:31,950
Sometimes you're
upstairs asleep.

128
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:33,420
Wait a minute.

129
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:35,010
Let's go back here.

130
00:05:35,090 --> 00:05:36,160
Jake, why aren't you
at your mother's?

131
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:37,330
I ran away.

132
00:05:37,390 --> 00:05:39,130
Sometimes you're
in the shower.

133
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:41,500
Rose, please.

134
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:43,030
Why did you run away?

135
00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:44,720
Because I hate it there.

136
00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:47,460
Is this about the
upcoming nuptials?

137
00:05:47,530 --> 00:05:50,000
It has nothing to do
with puberty, Dad.

138
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:53,300
It's about Mom getting married.

139
00:05:53,370 --> 00:05:56,430
I thought you
liked Dr. Melnick.

140
00:05:56,510 --> 00:05:58,150
That was when they
were just dating.

141
00:05:58,210 --> 00:05:59,880
Now he thinks he can
tell me what to do.

142
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:01,340
He's not my father.

143
00:06:01,410 --> 00:06:02,980
You don't do what
I tell you to do.

144
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:06,450
Yeah, but Mom doesn't care
about that.

145
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:08,890
Alan, Alan, can I just
interrupt for one sec?

146
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:10,080
How do you keep getting in?

147
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:11,520
I've changed the locks
three times.

148
00:06:11,590 --> 00:06:15,100
Yes, but you didn't
change the locksmith.

149
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:19,070
I could recommend somebody.

150
00:06:19,130 --> 00:06:21,240
Good night, Rose.

151
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:23,540
I replace everything
I eat.

152
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,930
Good night, Rose.

153
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,230
You know how
I do it?

154
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:28,830
I keep an exact duplicate
fridge at my house.

155
00:06:28,910 --> 00:06:30,410
Good night, Rose.

156
00:06:30,470 --> 00:06:33,370
By the way, we're
out of Popsicles.

157
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,540
All right, I'm going
to call your mother.

158
00:06:35,610 --> 00:06:37,280
She's probably
worried sick.

159
00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:40,420
She's probably in the hot tub
with Dr. Melnick.

160
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:43,020
How'd you get here?

161
00:06:43,090 --> 00:06:44,860
Did you steal a car
or something?

162
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:47,550
How can I steal a car?
I'm 12.

163
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:49,320
Oh, kids these days.

164
00:06:49,390 --> 00:06:51,490
No imagination.

165
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:53,090
I took the bus.

166
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:55,060
In L.A.? At night?

167
00:06:55,130 --> 00:06:57,930
You'd have been safer
stealing a car.

168
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,200
So what's your plan?
Where are you headed?

169
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:01,530
I'm going to stay here.

170
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:04,940
(chuckling):
Oh, you can't stay here.

171
00:07:05,010 --> 00:07:06,880
Why not?

172
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:08,840
Because you're running away.

173
00:07:08,910 --> 00:07:10,910
"Away," according
to the dictionary,

174
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:12,340
means "not here."

175
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:14,120
It's usually preceded

176
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:16,380
by the words, "far, far,"

177
00:07:16,450 --> 00:07:18,220
