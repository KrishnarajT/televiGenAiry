1
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:04,980
'cause I'm drunk,
aren't you?

2
00:00:05,050 --> 00:00:06,720
Yeah, I'm a bad girl.

3
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:09,390
Lucky for both of
us, I don't judge.

4
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:11,960
JAKE:
It's not my fault!

5
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:13,460
ALAN:
Then whose
fault is it?

6
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:15,220
JAKE:
I told you.
Uncle Charlie.

7
00:00:15,290 --> 00:00:16,730
I thought you lived alone.

8
00:00:16,790 --> 00:00:18,000
I do.

9
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:19,830
I leave the TV on
to deter criminals.

10
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:21,260
ALAN:
Charlie,

11
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:22,770
did you tell Jake
he could use your computer?

12
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:24,370
(scoffs)

13
00:00:24,430 --> 00:00:27,030
Just take what you want
and don't hurt us.

14
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:28,760
Go ahead and tell
him, Uncle Charlie.

15
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:30,110
No one's talking to you.

16
00:00:30,170 --> 00:00:32,800
Can you explain to me
why I caught him watching

17
00:00:32,870 --> 00:00:34,440
a Quicktime movie called
Vanessa Does Van Nuys?

18
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:37,710
Hey, meet Vanessa.

19
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:38,980
Why don't you hop upstairs?

20
00:00:39,050 --> 00:00:40,320
I'll be right there.

21
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:41,740
Okay.

22
00:00:41,810 --> 00:00:43,110
Hey, Dad, can we move
to Van Nuys?

23
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:44,350
No.

24
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:45,760
VANESSA:
Hey,

25
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:47,130
whose skateboard?
Mine.

26
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:48,330
Wow. It's really rad.

27
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:49,490
Thanks.

28
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:51,060
So's your movie.

29
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:52,120
Thanks.

30
00:00:52,190 --> 00:00:53,490
We're working on a sequel.

31
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:56,120
Yeah, I'm gonna do
Woodland Hills next.

32
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:59,170
Hop, hop,
hop, hop.

33
00:00:59,230 --> 00:01:01,430
Can we move to
Woodland Hills?

34
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:04,900
Forget Woodland Hills.

35
00:01:04,970 --> 00:01:06,100
Excuse me.
We were talking

36
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:07,440
about the dirty movie
on your computer.

37
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:09,510
I'm sorry. I forgot
it was on there.

38
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:10,980
You can't forget things
like that

39
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,510
when you have a child
in the house.

40
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:13,520
I'm not a child.

41
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:15,010
And I don't have him.

42
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:17,190
No one's talking to you,

43
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:18,250
and that's no excuse.

44
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:19,260
Look, it's not hardcore.

45
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:20,760
It's mostly her

46
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:23,020
and a couple of friends
having a pajama party.

47
00:01:23,090 --> 00:01:24,750
I didn't see pajamas.

48
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:26,150
Shut up. Go away.

49
00:01:28,830 --> 00:01:30,500
Again, I'm sorry.

50
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:32,360
Mea culpa.

51
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:36,530
Now, if you'll excuse me,
mea goin' upstairs.

52
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:38,530
For a culpa hours.

53
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:40,450
BERTA:
Hey, Charlie,

54
00:01:40,510 --> 00:01:42,010
who do I work
for— you

55
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:43,480
or this fastidious
parasite

56
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:45,010
you call a brother?

57
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:48,320
I get the feeling
you want me to say me.

58
00:01:49,450 --> 00:01:50,920
Me. Definitely me.

59
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:52,480
She works for me.

60
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:54,480
Well, then, tell her
when something

61
00:01:54,550 --> 00:01:56,950
is on the shopping
list, she should in
fact shop for it.

62
00:01:57,020 --> 00:01:59,050
I'm gonna slug him.
Can I slug him?

63
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:01,570
Why are you making such
a big deal out of this?
Because it is a big deal.

64
00:02:01,630 --> 00:02:03,200
No, it's not.
The hell it isn't.

65
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:04,190
Hey, what is going on here?

66
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:05,830
It's very simple.

67
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:07,540
I have decided to start drinking
acidophilus milk.

68
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:12,530
It promotes intestinal flora
which aids in healthy digestion.

69
00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:14,580
Anyway, for
three weeks,

70
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,900
I have been writing it
on the shopping list,

71
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:19,450
yet Berta insists
on bringing home two percent.

72
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:21,240
Slug him.

73
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:25,810
This is my life.

74
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:27,960
Milk and skateboards.

75
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:31,520
(thudding)

76
00:02:34,690 --> 00:02:38,360
It's a good thing I'm drunk.

77
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:42,930
♪ Men, men, men, men,
manly men, men, men ♪

78
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,870
♪ Men.

79
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:53,580
Extra large eggs.

80
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:54,920
Extra large eggs.

81
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:57,580
Acidophilus milk.

82
00:02:57,650 --> 00:02:59,750
Two percent milk,
you whiny pinhead.

83
00:03:01,790 --> 00:03:02,930
Morning.

84
00:03:02,990 --> 00:03:04,500
Hey, how you feeling?

85
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,600
Not too bad really.

86
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:07,930
That was some fall you took.

87
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:09,760
Yeah, if I hadn't
been plastered,

88
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:11,570
it might have killed me.

89
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:14,600
You'd think the liquor industry
would promote that.

90
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:16,240
It is a selling point.

91
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:19,200
Right up there with making
ugly people doable.

92
00:03:22,010 --> 00:03:24,820
Two percent—
the king of milk.

93
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:27,290
He's got to go, Charlie.

94
00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:29,420
What am I going to do, Berta,
he's my brother.

95
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:31,410
We could make it look
like an accident.

96
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:32,710
(doorbell ringing)

97
00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:35,830
No, no accidents.

98
00:03:35,890 --> 00:03:39,700
As long as my mother's alive
nothing happens to Fredo.

99
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:47,370
Hi.

100
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:53,250
I am sorry to bother you,
I'm just moving in next door.

101
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:54,380
Really?

102
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:56,710
You're my new neighbor?

103
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:00,350
Thank you, God.

104
00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:03,410
Anyway, I just wanted
to stop by and introduce myself.

105
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:04,480
Danielle Stewart.

106
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:06,210
Charlie Harper.

107
00:04:06,290 --> 00:04:07,430
Nice to meet you, Danielle.

108
00:04:07,490 --> 00:04:09,330
Come on in.
Oh, thank you.

109
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:11,700
We'll have a "welcome
to the neighborhood" drink.

110
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,470
It's 9:00 a.m.

111
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:16,930
You're right, who drinks
at 9:00 a.m.?

112
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,570
I wouldn't mind
a cup of coffee.

113
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:20,960
Great.

114
00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:23,770
Oh, Berta?
(angrily):
What?

115
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:27,780
My faithful housekeeper.

116
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,470
Would you be so kind

117
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:32,810
as to bring a cup of coffee
for our new neighbor?

118
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,720
Sure.

119
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:37,810
Luckiest S.O.B. on the planet.

120
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:40,620
Please.
Thank you.

121
00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:42,760
So, Danielle,
what brings you

122
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:44,220
to our little
stretch of paradise?

123
00:04:44,290 --> 00:04:48,160
Me? Well, I just got tired
of the cold winters in Chicago.

124
00:04:48,230 --> 00:04:49,630
Well, I don't want
to scare you away,

125
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:53,510
but winters here the mercury
can dip down to the mid-60s.

126
00:04:53,570 --> 00:04:55,870
Oh, how will I stay warm?

127
00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:57,940
I recommend the buddy system.

128
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,070
You're cute.

129
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:01,110
I know.

130
00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:03,980
So, what did you do in Chicago?

131
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:06,170
Well, for the last eight years

132
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:07,790
I've had a full-time career

133
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:08,990
trying to spend
my divorce settlement.

134
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:10,860
Oh, a working woman.

135
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:13,980
Well, buying a Malibu
beach house

136
00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:15,850
ought to take a big chunk
out of that settlement.

137
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:17,890
Yeah, you'd think.

138
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:20,900
Whoa.

139
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,820
Anyway, I've had my fun.

140
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:25,840
I want to settle down,
get serious with my life.

141
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:27,440
Oh, yeah, me, too.

142
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:29,930
No kidding.

143
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,700
So, are you married?

144
00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:34,970
Me? Uh... no.

145
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:37,840
Are you looking to get married?

146
00:05:37,910 --> 00:05:41,140
Uh... no.

147
00:05:41,210 --> 00:05:44,050
Do you like children?

148
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:47,160
Uh... no.

149
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:52,150
So how do you define getting
serious with your life?

150
00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:55,830
Well, I've stopped
drinking in the morning.

151
00:05:57,830 --> 00:05:59,830
Hey, Berta, where's that coffee?

152
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:01,510
You men are all alike.

153
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:03,880
Isn't there anyone left who just
wants to get married

154
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:05,210
and raise a family?

155
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:07,770
Yeah, but they're all gay.

156
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:10,850
Here we go.

157
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:12,910
Thank you.

158
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:16,250
Oh, you wouldn't happen to have
any acidophilus milk, would you?

159
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:24,650
Walk me through
this again.

160
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,890
She's beautiful,
rich, divorced

161
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:30,740
and you want to hand her off
to Zippy the Chimp?

162
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:34,040
Follow my reasoning here.

163
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:36,130
This is a woman looking
to settle down.

164
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:39,730
If I sleep with her,
I'm happy for one night.

165
00:06:39,810 --> 00:06:42,010
But if I teach my brother
to sleep with her,

166
00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:44,740
he falls in love,
asks her to marry him,

167
00:06:44,810 --> 00:06:47,740
moves out and I'm happy
for the rest of my life.

168
00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:49,610
It's a nice plan,
but it'll never happen.

169
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:50,950
Don't-don't-don't say that.

170
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:52,060
(spitting)

171
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:54,030
Unjinx, unjinx, unjinx.

172
00:06:54,090 --> 00:06:55,930
Charlie, she is way
out of his league.

173
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:59,060
I know that. Everybody
is out of his league.

174
00:06:59,130 --> 00:07:02,000
He doesn't even
have a league.

175
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:05,630
He's just a kid with
a bat and a ball and
a football helmet.

176
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:08,540
But luckily he has me.

177
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,060
Color me dubious.

178
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:11,780
ALAN:
I'm home.

179
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:14,210
Come on, I need you
to be with me on this one.

180
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:15,240
It'll never work.

181
00:07:17,810 --> 00:07:18,810
Voila.

182
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:19,980
This...

183
00:07:20,050 --> 00:07:22,120
is acidophilus milk.

184
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:24,650
It's on the shelf below
the two percent

185
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,990
right next to the low-fat
yogurt.

186
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:30,050
Boy, does your brother have
a girl for you.

187
00:07:32,290 --> 00:07:33,860
What?

188
00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:35,130
She just moved next door.

189
00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:37,660
She's gorgeous,
divorced and loaded.

190
00:07:37,730 --> 00:07:39,730
Mm-hmm. What's wrong with her?

191
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:42,040
Why does something have
to be wrong with her?

192
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:45,130
Because there's only two reasons
you ever set me up with a woman.

193
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:47,870
Either you need somebody to keep
the emotionally disturbed

194
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:50,100
or cross-eyed or hermaphroditic
best friend busy

195
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:51,820
while you do
the pretty girl,

196
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:53,920
or...

197
00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:55,610
okay, I guess there's
just one reason.

198
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:59,160
There is nothing wrong
with Danielle.

199
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:01,230
Berta, is she or is
she not gorgeous?

200
00:08:01,290 --> 00:08:02,890
Hey, I'd do her.

201
00:08:05,790 --> 00:08:08,060
If she's so great, why
are you giving her to me?

202
00:08:08,130 --> 00:08:09,370
You want the truth?

203
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:10,970
It'd be a nice
change of pace.

204
00:08:11,030 --> 00:08:14,960
All right, first of all,

205
00:08:15,030 --> 00:08:17,870
I am sorry about the
hermaphroditic incident.

206
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:22,050
"I'm sorry" doesn't make up
for leaving me in a hotel room

207
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:24,180
with a girl who had
a vestigial penis.

208
00:08:26,150 --> 00:08:27,620
I didn't know.

209
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,040
I was as surprised as you were.

210
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,990
Charlie, no one
was as surprised as I was.

211
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,990
But let's move on.

212
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:38,230
I'm not saying I didn't try
to hit on our new neighbor,

213
00:08:38,290 --> 00:08:39,190
because I did.

214
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:41,000
And?
I got nowhere.

215
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:45,290
She saw him for the mindless
meat-seeking missile that he is.

216
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:49,900
Anyway... I just thought
you two might hit it off.

217
00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:52,010
I'm even making
a little welcome basket

218
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:53,870
for you to give
to her, see?

219
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:56,270
So, she's beautiful,
rich and single?

220
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:57,710
Right.

221
00:08:57,780 --> 00:08:58,950
Why would she want me?

222
00:08:59,010 --> 00:09:01,040
What kind of thing
is that to say?

223
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:02,640
Why wouldn't she want you?

224
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:05,060
I'm broke, middle-aged,
twice divorced

225
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,760
sleeping on your
on your hide-a-bed

226
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:09,090
and sharing custody of a
flatulent, underachieving son.

227
00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:14,090
We're gonna need
a bigger basket.

228
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:17,930
You're gonna need
chloroform and a rope.

229
00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:22,800
♪ Men...

230
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:25,010
Just remember, the most
important thing

231
00:09:25,070 --> 00:09:26,730
is to project confidence.

232
00:09:26,810 --> 00:09:27,910
Got it.

233
00:09:27,970 --> 00:09:29,940
How do I look?

234
00:09:30,010 --> 00:09:32,820
Just project confidence.

235
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,280
Here, you give her
the welcome basket.

236
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:39,460
All right, what do I say?

237
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:40,860
"Welcome."

238
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:43,280
Good, that's good.

239
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,360
Oh, hi.

240
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:46,990
Welcome.

241
00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:51,040
Danielle, this is
my brother Alan.

242
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:52,440
Alan, Danielle.

243
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,870
Alan just wanted to welcome
you to the neighborhood.

244
00:09:54,930 --> 00:09:56,760
Welcome.

245
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:00,000
Thank you.

246
00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:01,800
You're welcome.

247
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:03,940
Would you like
to come in?

248
00:10:04,010 --> 00:10:06,140
I don't know, she seems
kind of busy.

249
00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:07,710
Maybe we should
come back...
Go, go, go.

250
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:10,280
I am sorry that the
place is such a mess.

251
00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:11,890
Don't be silly.

252
00:10:11,950 --> 00:10:14,350
Moving takes time,
right, Alan?

253
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:15,820
Oh, yes.

254
00:10:15,890 --> 00:10:17,260
I remember the last
time I moved,

255
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,920
it was very time-consuming.

256
00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:20,920
I had to collect boxes
and those packing peanuts,

257
00:10:20,990 --> 00:10:23,090
and boy, those things
get everywhere.

258
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:25,160
Hey, you know, that's summer
sausage, not salami.

259
00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:26,960
A lot of people
confuse the two.

260
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:28,860
Interesting.

261
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:30,980
So, why don't I

262
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,280
open up this wine

263
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:33,850
and we can toast
to my new home.

264
00:10:33,910 --> 00:10:35,150
Good idea.

265
00:10:35,210 --> 00:10:37,280
None for me. Red wine
makes me gassy.

266
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,380
I'm sorry, I don't have
anything else to offer.

267
00:10:42,450 --> 00:10:43,960
I haven't had time to go
grocery shopping.

268
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:46,320
Well, then you must
be starving.

269
00:10:46,390 --> 00:10:48,290
Alan, I think we should take
this young lady out to dinner.

270
00:10:48,350 --> 00:10:51,120
But I was planning on warming up
the pot roast from Sunday night.

271
00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:54,220
The pot roast will keep.

272
00:10:54,290 --> 00:10:56,790
I don't know,
it's right on the edge.

273
00:10:56,860 --> 00:10:59,430
Forget the pot roast.

274
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:01,410
So what do you say?
We could walk up the beach

275
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:02,870
to Georgio's and grab a bite.

276
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:04,180
You know, that
sounds wonderful.

277
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,080
Let me just throw on
some clean clothes.

278
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:07,440
Terrific.

279
00:11:07,510 --> 00:11:08,950
Great. I will be right back.

280
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:13,950
Huh? Huh?

281
00:11:14,010 --> 00:11:15,040
She's incredible.

282
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:16,210
Incredible my ass,

283
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:17,550
she's perfect.

284
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:20,890
Okay, a couple of pointers.

285
00:11:20,950 --> 00:11:22,120
First off,

286
00:11:22,190 --> 00:11:24,800
you never open with "gassy."

287
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:26,360
I know that.
It just came out.

288
00:11:26,430 --> 00:11:27,570
It's all right, it's all right.

289
00:11:27,630 --> 00:11:28,900
No, no permanent damage.

290
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,560
Now what's going
to happen here

291
00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:31,990
is I'm going
to bail on dinner

292
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:32,990
so you two
can be alone.

293
00:11:33,070 --> 00:11:34,340
Really?

294
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,900
'Cause Georgia's
is kind of pricey.

295
00:11:35,970 --> 00:11:38,580
Oh, geez.

296
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:42,010
Here, tip big.

297
00:11:42,070 --> 00:11:43,370
Don't agonize over the math.

298
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,910
I don't agonize.

299
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:46,420
I just take the sales
tax and double it

300
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,190
which is roughly 15%.

301
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:50,050
Unless, of course, the service
is less than impeccable

302
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:51,920
in which case I leave
a flat five dollars.

303
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:56,050
Alan, it's my money, go crazy.

304
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:59,050
Fine, 18% it is.

305
00:11:59,130 --> 00:12:02,970
Now, dinner conversation.

306
00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:05,040
Don't talk about your boring
job, your petty problems

307
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:06,200
or your stupid hobbies.

308
00:12:06,270 --> 00:12:07,970
What else is there?

309
00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:10,900
Her petty problems,
her stupid hobbies.

310
00:12:10,970 --> 00:12:13,000
No woman ever came home
from a date complaining

311
00:12:13,070 --> 00:12:14,500
that all she did
was talk about herself.

312
00:12:14,570 --> 00:12:16,240
Oh, that's good.

313
00:12:16,310 --> 00:12:19,020
And that way,
I remain an enigma.

314
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:22,490
Yeah, let's call you an enigma.

315
00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:26,120
All righty, do I look okay?

316
00:12:26,190 --> 00:12:28,860
You look beautiful,
fantastic.

317
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:30,480
Right, Alan?

318
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:31,960
Welcome.

319
00:12:34,530 --> 00:12:35,900
Okay, let's go.

320
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:44,410
Let me just lock up.

321
00:12:46,170 --> 00:12:47,270
Oh, no...

322
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:49,510
What do you mean
you have to go?

323
00:12:54,010 --> 00:12:56,880
I mean, uh, what's wrong?

324
00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:01,330
I just remembered I have
some work I need to do.

325
00:13:01,390 --> 00:13:03,530
Oh, no!

326
00:13:03,590 --> 00:13:05,060
Oh, what a shame.

327
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,590
Maybe we should
do this another time.

328
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:08,500
BOTH:
No, no.

329
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,320
You two go ahead,
enjoy yourselves.
Are you sure?

330
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:12,300
He's sure. Let's go.
Okay.

331
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:13,590
See you later,
Charlie.

332
00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:17,070
So, Danielle, you got any
hobbies or problems?

333
00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:24,210
Yes, I know she's hot.

334
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:31,160
But I'm thinking long-term,
so shut up!

335
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:32,920
♪ Men...

336
00:13:37,190 --> 00:13:39,500
♪ Men...

337
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:41,100
Hey.
Hey.

338
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:42,090
Where have you been?

339
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:43,560
Stuck in traffic.

340
00:13:43,630 --> 00:13:45,240
Danielle's coming over
in a few minutes.

341
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:46,440
Got to shower and change.

342
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:48,370
Wow, you two
are going out again?

343
00:13:48,430 --> 00:13:49,960
What can I say, Charlie?

344
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:51,040
The girl digs my mojo.

345
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:53,330
When did you get mojo?

346
00:13:53,410 --> 00:13:55,210
Scoff if you like,

347
00:13:55,270 --> 00:13:57,440
but that woman is entranced
by the enigma

348
00:13:57,510 --> 00:13:59,120
that is Alan Jerome Harper.

349
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:03,590
Unbelievable— your
plan is working.

350
00:14:03,650 --> 00:14:05,160
Told ya.

351
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:07,090
There must be something wrong
with that girl.

352
00:14:07,150 --> 00:14:09,650
There must be a lot wrong
with that girl.

353
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:11,720
Well, then it's a match
made in heaven.

354
00:14:11,790 --> 00:14:13,350
There's something wrong with her

355
00:14:13,430 --> 00:14:14,630
and we know there's something
wrong with him.

356
00:14:14,690 --> 00:14:16,260
(doorbell rings)

357
00:14:16,330 --> 00:14:18,140
Yeah, and before you know it,
he'll move out,

358
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:20,040
they'll get married

359
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:21,770
and we'll be wondering
what's wrong with their kids.

360
00:14:24,770 --> 00:14:26,000
Hey, Charlie.

361
00:14:26,070 --> 00:14:27,030
Hey, Danielle.
Come on in.

362
00:14:27,110 --> 00:14:28,580
Thank you.
Oh, man.

363
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:30,740
If the kid
wants to kill me

364
00:14:30,810 --> 00:14:33,040
why doesn't he just cut
my brake line?

365
00:14:34,810 --> 00:14:36,080
Alan's in the shower.

366
00:14:36,150 --> 00:14:37,690
Am I too early?

367
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:40,180
No, no. No, he's been living
here for three years.

368
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:41,650
You want a drink?

369
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:42,650
No, thank you.

370
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,190
I'm trying to cut down.

371
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:45,200
Really? Why?

372
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:47,360
Long story.

373
00:14:47,430 --> 00:14:50,030
Alan takes long showers.

374
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:52,100
Longer when
he's not dating.

375
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:54,060
Thank you, Berta.

376
00:14:57,870 --> 00:15:00,100
So, tell me your story.

377
00:15:00,170 --> 00:15:02,100
It's a little embarrassing.

378
00:15:02,170 --> 00:15:04,070
Hey, all the good drinking
stories are.

379
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:06,080
After a night of partying

380
00:15:06,150 --> 00:15:07,420
at the Pomona State Fair,

381
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:09,520
I once woke up on a tilt-a-whirl
wearing nothing

382
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:11,810
but a grass skirt
and a tiny sombrero.

383
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:15,250
No kidding?

384
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:18,150
I've still got the sombrero.

385
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:19,720
Okay, your turn.

386
00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:22,560
All right, um...

387
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:26,770
the reason my marriage
didn't work out...

388
00:15:26,830 --> 00:15:30,100
the reason none of my
relationships work out,

389
00:15:30,170 --> 00:15:33,440
is because I tend to drink
a little too much

390
00:15:33,510 --> 00:15:36,350
and then do things I regret.

391
00:15:36,410 --> 00:15:37,820
And by "things," you mean...?

392
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:40,180
Men.

393
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:42,120
Huh.

394
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:44,310
And the occasional woman.

395
00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:47,080
Huh.

396
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:52,750
Well, as stories go,
I'd say this is a good one.

397
00:15:52,830 --> 00:15:54,800
At least yours
doesn't end

398
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:58,490
with a toothless carnie
offering you a churro.

399
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:01,660
You know, I had a feeling
you'd understand.

400
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:05,170
Alan is very sweet,

401
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:09,580
but the guys I usually go for
are more like... well, you.

402
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:12,140
Huh.

403
00:16:12,210 --> 00:16:18,210
Anyway, I think I am ready
for a nice normal relationship.

404
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:20,810
No more getting blitzed
and falling into bed

405
00:16:20,890 --> 00:16:24,130
with the first guy who asks me.

406
00:16:24,190 --> 00:16:25,890
Or a girl.

407
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:28,570
Or a couple.

408
00:16:28,630 --> 00:16:31,340
Huh.

409
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:37,460
Huh-huh-huh-huh.

410
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:39,240
(clears throat)

411
00:16:39,310 --> 00:16:41,180
Excuse me.

412
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:47,310
Okay, new plan.

413
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:48,590
I'm going to boink Danielle

414
00:16:48,650 --> 00:16:51,320
and Alan's going
to live here forever.

415
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:53,510
Quelle surprise.

416
00:17:00,130 --> 00:17:01,170
Hello.

417
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:02,800
It's not your night, Alan.

418
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:04,330
What?

419
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,140
Danielle, she's not right
for you.

420
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:08,110
But you said
she was perfect for me.

421
00:17:08,170 --> 00:17:09,570
I was wrong.

422
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:10,770
She's sick and twisted.

423
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:12,240
That makes her perfect for me.

424
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:15,240
I'm sorry, I'm not following.

425
00:17:15,310 --> 00:17:17,650
I was talking
to her out there

426
00:17:17,710 --> 00:17:20,180
and it turns out she's a
boozehound and a sex freak.

427
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:21,490
What?

428
00:17:21,550 --> 00:17:23,320
I haven't seen that
in her at all.

429
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:25,810
I mean, I got a good-night kiss,
but she was perfectly sober

430
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:27,710
and her tongue
did nothing freaky.

431
00:17:27,790 --> 00:17:30,430
That's because she's trying
to hide who she really is.

432
00:17:30,490 --> 00:17:31,730
Who's that?
Me!

433
00:17:31,790 --> 00:17:33,790
She's me, Alan,
top to bottom,

434
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:36,730
except, you know,
from here to here.

435
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:39,340
So what is you want me to do,
step aside

436
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:41,840
so you can lead her back
to a life of sordid degradation?

437
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:44,270
If you wouldn't mind.

438
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:45,480
No! No! No!

439
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:46,580
You gave her to me.

440
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:47,380
There's no takebacks.

441
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,750
All right, fine.

442
00:17:48,810 --> 00:17:50,410
We'll just let her make
her own decision.

443
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:52,320
All right, all right,
may the better man win.

444
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,750
You would be rooting
for the shriveled man.

445
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:04,320
Oh, now, just a little.

446
00:18:04,390 --> 00:18:05,820
You got it.

447
00:18:05,890 --> 00:18:09,360
That is a
beautiful dress.

448
00:18:09,430 --> 00:18:10,500
Whoops.

449
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:12,490
Ooh.

450
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:13,760
Sorry.

451
00:18:13,830 --> 00:18:16,230
That's okay.

452
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:18,730
Mm...

453
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:20,130
buttery...

454
00:18:20,210 --> 00:18:22,710
with a slight citrus finish.

455
00:18:22,770 --> 00:18:24,670
Hmm.

456
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:31,690
Ah!

457
00:18:34,490 --> 00:18:35,660
You know wine.

458
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:39,590
Okay, Danielle,
we'd better get going

459
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:41,330
if we're gonna make
that reservation.

460
00:18:41,390 --> 00:18:43,220
You're right. Well, thanks
for the wine, Charlie.

461
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:44,770
Whoa, whoa, what's the hurry?

462
00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:45,890
I was going to make
a pitcher of margaritas.

463
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:47,730
Ooh, I love margaritas!

464
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:50,210
Be right back.

465
00:18:50,270 --> 00:18:52,340
Gee, Danielle, do you really
want to sit here

466
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:53,570
and drink with Charlie?

467
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:56,910
Oh, yeah, you're right, Alan.

468
00:18:56,980 --> 00:18:58,420
You're a nice guy.

469
00:18:58,480 --> 00:18:59,920
You're good for me.

470
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:01,690
Okay, Charlie, we're leaving!

471
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:03,220
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

472
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:04,710
If you don't have time
for margaritas,

473
00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:06,150
I could mix one up
in your mouth.

474
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:07,220
Cut it out, Charlie.

475
00:19:07,290 --> 00:19:08,860
I know what you're trying to do?

476
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:10,780
What are you talking about?
I'm being a good host.

477
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:12,300
(hushed):
You're taking advantage
of Danielle.

478
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:14,500
No, no, I respect
Danielle for who she is.

479
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:17,700
for who she's
pretending to be.

480
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,260
I don't get you—
why did you bother

481
00:19:19,330 --> 00:19:20,760
putting us together
in the first place?

482
00:19:20,830 --> 00:19:22,900
Because I thought
she was dull and
boring like you.

483
00:19:22,970 --> 00:19:25,210
and I had hoped the two
of you would go

484
00:19:25,270 --> 00:19:26,830
and be dull and boring
at her house!

485
00:19:26,910 --> 00:19:29,680
That was really your plan?
That's insane!

486
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:32,170
It would have worked if she
wasn't a drunken slut!

487
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:34,840
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

488
00:19:34,910 --> 00:19:38,810
There is no need
to fight over me.

489
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:42,680
Alan, you're a sweet gentle guy.

490
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:46,590
Charlie, you're a pig.

491
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:48,500
But I find you very attractive.

492
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:51,860
There's only one
reasonable solution.

493
00:19:51,930 --> 00:19:54,760
I have to do you both.

494
00:20:00,970 --> 00:20:02,700
No crossing swords.

495
00:20:03,810 --> 00:20:05,820
Are you out of your mind?

496
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:06,750
You're actually
considering this?

497
00:20:06,810 --> 00:20:08,340
Yeah, you're right.

498
00:20:08,410 --> 00:20:10,580
I don't even like eating
dinner next to you.

499
00:20:11,950 --> 00:20:13,310
Thank you

500
00:20:13,390 --> 00:20:15,430
for your generous offer,

501
00:20:15,490 --> 00:20:16,760
but I'm afraid
we must decline.

502
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:18,890
But mostly he's afraid.

503
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:21,530
I should have known.

504
00:20:21,590 --> 00:20:22,760
Not a pair between you.

505
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:28,400
Well, if either of you
change your mind,

506
00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:30,270
you know where to find me.

507
00:20:31,870 --> 00:20:33,400
(gasps)

508
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:37,770
Okay, you can have her.

509
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:39,370
♪ Men...

510
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:48,690
"One pound salted butter...

511
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:53,090
"one dozen extra-large eggs...

512
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:57,930
one acidophilus milk
for the whiny pinhead."

513
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,840
I thought I was
the only one who
drank this stuff.

514
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:02,930
What? Are you kidding me?

515
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,400
It's all I drink.

516
00:21:05,470 --> 00:21:08,740
You know,
for the intestinal... fauna.

517
00:21:08,810 --> 00:21:10,350
That's all you drink?

518
00:21:10,410 --> 00:21:11,250
Well, I've been known

519
00:21:11,310 --> 00:21:13,440
to add a few fingers of vodka.

520
00:21:13,510 --> 00:21:17,710
Kind of a acidopha-tini.

521
00:21:19,350 --> 00:21:20,750
You're cute.

522
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:22,030
So I've been told.

523
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:28,960
I can't. I promised Berta
I'd get the groceries.

524
00:21:29,030 --> 00:21:33,700
You're right. You're always
right.
