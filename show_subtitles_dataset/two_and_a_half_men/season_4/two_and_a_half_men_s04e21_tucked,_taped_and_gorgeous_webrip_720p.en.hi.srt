00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:03,890
(laughs loudly)

2
00:00:03,950 --> 00:00:05,150
Oh, oh, that
is so true.

3
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:06,630
I know exactly
what you mean.

4
00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:08,390
Hang on. I'll get
you an ashtray.

5
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:09,860
Oh, hey, charlie.

6
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:11,720
Hey. What's going on?

7
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:13,420
Oh, i just have
a friend over

8
00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:15,120
From my single parent
support group.

9
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:17,200
Oh, yeah. Unattached moms.

10
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:19,490
I got to check out that group.

11
00:00:19,570 --> 00:00:22,510
But you don't have a kid.

12
00:00:22,570 --> 00:00:24,640
Are they really strict
about that?

13
00:00:25,870 --> 00:00:27,040
'cause, at the dog park,

14
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:28,950
You just show up
with a leash and say,

15
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:30,020
"that's him by the tree."

16
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:32,080
It's a single parent group.

17
00:00:32,150 --> 00:00:34,290
You need to be a single parent.

18
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:36,590
Seems a little prejudiced,
if you ask me.

19
00:00:36,650 --> 00:00:39,480
Hey, alan,
can i use your bathroom

20
00:00:39,550 --> 00:00:41,620
Or should i just
pee off the deck?

21
00:00:41,690 --> 00:00:43,260
It's right
down the hall.

22
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:45,050
Oh, greg, this is
my brother charlie.

23
00:00:45,130 --> 00:00:46,130
Charlie, greg.

24
00:00:46,190 --> 00:00:48,120
Hey.
Hey. Nice place.

25
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:49,470
Thanks.

26
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:53,210
She's a little butch for you,
isn't she?

27
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:54,910
Greg's a divorced dad.

28
00:00:54,970 --> 00:00:57,110
He's got a daughter
around jake's age.

29
00:00:57,170 --> 00:00:59,300
Well, you can understand
my confusion.

30
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:01,800
You think i joined a support
group to pick up women?

31
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:03,720
No. I think you
joined a support group

32
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:05,220
Because you're
a whiny little wuss.

33
00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:09,760
But as long as you're there,
you might as well nail a few.

34
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:12,960
Sex is not what
the group's about.

35
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:14,350
Oh, grow up.

36
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:15,780
You put single men and women

37
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:17,560
In folding chairs
in a church basement,

38
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:19,720
They're going to start
mounting each other.

39
00:01:19,790 --> 00:01:24,830
The depths of your degeneracy
continue to astound me.

40
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:27,340
Really? Still?

41
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:29,130
So, charlie,
i am guessing,

42
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,070
By the stack of racing forms
next to the can,

43
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:32,680
You bet the ponies.

44
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:35,240
Hey, i'd bet on rabbits
if you could get 'em organized.

45
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:38,780
Is there a story
behind that riding crop

46
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:39,920
Hanging on the wall?

47
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:41,380
Oh, yeah— that's a souvenir

48
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:43,590
From a wonderful weekend
in louisville, kentucky.

49
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:44,780
Oh, you went to the derby?

50
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:46,950
Nah. It was a hilton
by the airport.

51
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:50,130
How about you?
Do you hit the track?

52
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:53,760
Yeah. It's actually my second
biggest expense after alimony.

53
00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:56,430
So all your money
goes to the nags, huh?

54
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:59,100
Hey, your brother's funny.

55
00:01:59,170 --> 00:02:00,440
At first.

56
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:04,430
I'll get us
some more beers.

57
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:05,930
Charlie, you smoke cigars?

58
00:02:06,010 --> 00:02:07,010
I'd smoke rabbits

59
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:08,640
If you could keep 'em lit.

60
00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:15,480

Nothing's confirmed.

Yeah. Yeah, terrific.

105
00:03:57,650 --> 00:03:59,250
How much do you know about him?

106
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:01,730
Well, i know he's
a successful architect,

107
00:04:01,790 --> 00:04:03,730
His daughter is
a soccer player,

108
00:04:03,790 --> 00:04:06,190

00:04:37,790 --> 00:04:39,820
For 16 years,
he didn't know he was gay.

122
00:04:41,290 --> 00:04:42,690
You don't believe
two men can be friends

of them is gay?

00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:47,630
It has nothing
to do with gay.

You put out
a special kind of vibe.

213
00:08:58,220 --> 00:09:01,190
You don't mean special.

Oh, right, right.

for when you lean out

have known that was a guy.

palm a medicine ball.

taped and gorgeous.

A dude who wanted
to be a woman,

243
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:24,270
Which means he was looking for
a straight man, which is me!

Rationalize it
any way you want,

245
00:10:26,670 --> 00:10:30,410
But he still sends you flowers
on valentine's day.

246

Mm-Hmm.

316
00:13:27,690 --> 00:13:29,360
And to think all this time
i've been blaming myself

00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:30,820
'cause the marriage
didn't work out.

318
00:13:30,890 --> 00:13:34,020
No, i'm pretty sure
you've been blaming me.

00:13:47,770 --> 00:13:49,240
Your mother told me
to tell you

329
00:13:49,310 --> 00:13:50,880
That she's behind you 100%.

330
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:53,010
When did you talk
to my mother?

331
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:55,950
Well, after jake told me,
i called her.

332
00:13:56,020 --> 00:13:57,120
Why?

333
00:13:57,180 --> 00:13:59,110
We have a little bet.
It's not important.

334
00:13:59,190 --> 00:14:00,160
Okay, bye-Bye!

335
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:07,500
I mean, okay, i do care
about my appearance.

336
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:08,960
Plus, i've got mother issues

337
00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:11,100
And a bit of a flair
for interior design.

338
00:14:12,330 --> 00:14:15,060
You know, sconces, throw
pillows, bric-A-Brac.

00:14:15,130 --> 00:14:16,860
Mm...

340
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:19,740
But when it comes to penises,
i am pretty clear

341
00:14:19,810 --> 00:14:23,010
That the only one i want
winking at me is my own.

342
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:27,740
Who are you trying to convince
here, charlie, me or you?

343
00:14:27,810 --> 00:14:30,610
You. And than i want you
to convince me.

344
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:33,210
Why do you need convincing?

345
00:14:33,290 --> 00:14:36,090
Wow, good question.

346
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:39,860
Thanks. Once in a while
i get a little wood on the ball.

347
00:14:39,930 --> 00:14:43,640
I mean, it has been suggested
to me that all of my womanizing

348
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:46,240
Is just my way
of overcompensating.

349
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:47,810
And who suggested that?

350
00:14:47,870 --> 00:14:52,680
Uh, mostly the women i was
overcompensating on top of.

351
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:57,110
Well, this is a very
interesting area,

352
00:14:57,180 --> 00:14:59,420
But i'm afraid
we're out of time.

353
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:02,590
What?
No, no, we can't stop here!

354
00:15:02,650 --> 00:15:04,160
I have a patient
