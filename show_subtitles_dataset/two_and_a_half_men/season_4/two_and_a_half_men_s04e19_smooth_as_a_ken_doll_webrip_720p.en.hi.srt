1
00:00:05,230 --> 00:00:07,540
(keys jingling, phone rings)

2
00:00:10,670 --> 00:00:12,170
Hello.

3
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:14,980
Oh, hey, julia;
i was just on my way over.

4
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:16,510
Anything i need to bring?

5
00:00:16,570 --> 00:00:21,540
Thai food, wine, batteries?

6
00:00:21,610 --> 00:00:24,110
What do you mean, "don't come"?

7
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:25,410
(sighs)

8
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:27,180
Gee, do you really think
your psychiatrist

9
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:29,380
Is the best judge
of who you should sleep with?

10
00:00:30,950 --> 00:00:32,990
Well, sure you could do better.

11
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:35,400
We could both do better.

12
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:38,330
But in the meantime,
i am on my way over.

13
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:40,370
Okay, okay, need
to stop you here.

14
00:00:40,430 --> 00:00:41,590
There is a big difference

15
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:45,560
Between "meaningless"
and "degrading."

16
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:47,540
You know what?

17
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:50,300
I think we just have
to agree to disagree.

18
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:53,210
Okay, then,
you have a nice life, too.

19
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:59,890
Why do these women
insist on getting well?

20
00:00:59,950 --> 00:01:02,320
Hey, alan...
Hang on, charlie.

21
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:04,260
This is an
important moment,

22
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:05,980
And i want
to savor it.

23
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:09,460
Alan...

24
00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:12,170
J.

25
00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:14,000
Harper.

26
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,210
What's the big deal?
It's just an alimony check.

27
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:20,180
Not an alimony check.

28
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:24,410
This is my final alimony check.

29
00:01:26,410 --> 00:01:28,050
Isn't it beautiful?

30
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:29,310
Oh, wait.

31
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:30,450
Judith is getting married
this weekend.

32
00:01:30,510 --> 00:01:31,440
Exactly.

33
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:33,580
And you know
what that means.

34
00:01:33,650 --> 00:01:35,950
You can finally kick in
a few bucks around here?

35
00:01:37,850 --> 00:01:40,090
Good one. No.

36
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:42,800
It means alan gets
new underwear.

37
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:47,830
Now, if you'll excuse me,
i'm going to go pick up my son

38
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:50,610
And deliver this last drop
of blood money

39
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:52,170
To the former mrs. Alan harper

40
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:54,240
And soon-To-Be
mrs. Herb melnick.

41
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:55,930
May god have
mercy on his soul.

42
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:01,120
Amen.

43
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,790
So, you want
some company?

44
00:02:04,850 --> 00:02:06,150
You want to come
with me?

45
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:08,120
Eh, why not?
I don't have
any plans.

46
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:10,730
You got stood up
again, didn't you?

47
00:02:10,790 --> 00:02:12,760
I'm starting to think
all these girls

48
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:14,890
Have the same
damn shrink.

49
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:17,170
All right, well, if you're
gonna come, grab your camera.

50
00:02:17,230 --> 00:02:19,130
You can take some snapshots
of pharaoh judith

51
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,840
Letting her alan go.

52
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:23,000
Got the camera right here.

53
00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:25,040
You carry it with you?

54
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:26,660
I thought i had a date.

55
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:30,040
Takes video, too.

63
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,800
Stopping at the copy place
was a great idea.

64
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:06,400
And the picture
will make a terrific
christmas card.

65
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:09,450
Judith:
want to get
the door, herb?

66
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:10,840
Herb:
stop yelling at me!

67
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:12,540
I'm not yelling!

68
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:15,390
(louder):
this is yelling!

69
00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:17,650
You know what?
This really isn't that funny.

70
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:20,460
Oh, hi, alan,
charlie.

71
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:21,490
Herb.
Hey.

72
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:22,700
This a bad time?

73
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:25,130
The spanish inquisition
was a bad time.

74
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,030
This is hell.

75
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:28,340
Come in.

76
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,670
So what's going on?

77
00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:31,530
A little pre-
Wedding jitters?

78
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,030
You could call it that,

79
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:35,030
But we'd just
be sugar-Coating hell.

80
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:36,670
Oh, don't worry.

81
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:38,550
As soon as judith puts
on that beautiful
white gown

82
00:03:38,610 --> 00:03:40,010
And starts marching
down that aisle...

83
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,350
She doesn't want
to wear white.

84
00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:43,040
Says it makes
her look fat.

85
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:44,610
Oh, well, that's nice.

86
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:46,080
She wants to look
trim and fit

87
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:47,320
For the honeymoon.

88
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:50,250
You're sugar-Coating
hell again, alan.

89
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:51,620
If you really want
to help the guy,

90
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:53,400
Stop talking and smother him
with a pillow.

91
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:55,700
Hey.

92
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:58,270
Hey, there's the blushing bride.

93
00:03:58,330 --> 00:03:59,530
She doesn't look fat
at all.

94
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:02,560
Go ahead.
Give her the check.

95
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:04,230
What check?

96
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:08,570
Oh, uh, well, i-I figured
as long as i was here,

97
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:14,050
That i would give you your last
and final alimony check.

98
00:04:16,710 --> 00:04:18,410
Got it.

99
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:20,110
What the hell are you doing?

100
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:21,380
Just a little
souvenir.

101
00:04:21,450 --> 00:04:22,780
I'll go find jake.

102
00:04:22,850 --> 00:04:24,680
See? She's being
a good sport.

103
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:26,320
Let's get one
with the big check.

104
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:28,500
Forget the big check.

105
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:32,400
So, um, you know, um,
i-I read an interesting
story the other day.

106
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:34,790
Uh, married men
live, on average,

107
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:36,790
Ten years longer
than single men.

108
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:38,710
What if they
don't want to?

109
00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:41,640
Come on, you and judith
were made for each other.

110
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:43,470
What could possibly
come between you?

111
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:44,340
My sister.

112
00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:45,780
You got a sister?

113
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,610
Down, charlie.

114
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:50,220
She came out a few days early
to help with the wedding,

115
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:51,280
But it's not really helping.

116
00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:52,650
What does she look like?
Charlie!

117
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,420
She doesn't have
a therapist, does she?

118
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:55,480
Charlie, i swear to god!

119
00:04:55,550 --> 00:04:57,550
So what do you think?

120
00:04:57,620 --> 00:05:00,490
Should i wear it or have a vet
check it for worms?

121
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:04,100
No, no, it looks fine.

122
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,220
Oh, myra, this is
judith's first husband, alan.

123
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:08,240
Hi.
So how does this work?

124
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:10,100
Do you get your
original testicles back

125
00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:11,870
Or does my brother
give you his?

126
00:05:13,670 --> 00:05:16,330
Myra, the castration jokes
are getting a little old.

127
00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:17,810
Not in my house.

128
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:21,320
Myra, this is alan's brother,
charlie.

129
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:23,180
Oh, yeah, the booze-
Riddled sleazebag.

130
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:25,840
She did not hear that from me.

131
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:28,490
It's not like it's a big secret.

132
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:29,650
Judith:
myra,

133
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:30,890
Where the hell is jake?

134
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:32,850
How should i know?

135
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,850
Because i asked you
to get him ready to go
to his father's.

136
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:39,120
You also asked me to try on
this satin stool sample.

137
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:41,440
Herb, tell your sister
it's a lovely dress.

138
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:43,370
Herb, tell your fiancée
the diet pills

139
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:45,830
Are affecting her judgment
but not her ass.

140
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:47,630
That's it,
she's got to go.

141
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:49,770
I can't throw
out family!

142
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:52,410
And that's the
bitch of it, herb.

143
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,870
Hey, um, charlie and i

144
00:05:56,950 --> 00:05:58,790
Were thinking of taking
jake out to a movie.

145
00:05:58,850 --> 00:06:00,520
We were?
We were.

146
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:02,310
Myra, would you like
to join us?

147
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:03,890
You didn't say anything
about a movie.

148
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:06,550
I wanted to
surprise you.

149
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:08,550
Hey, you know what?
That's a great idea.

150
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:10,400
Go to a movie
with alan and charlie.

151
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:12,790
Can i wear my pretty new dress?

152
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:15,390
Get her out, herb.

153
00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:18,810
Hey, look what i found
in the bushes.

154
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,470
♪ Men...

155
00:06:27,710 --> 00:06:29,440
(sighs)

156
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:32,780
God, i hate
family movies.

157
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:34,490
What, you don't buy
the central premise

158
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:36,410
That a dog
can play hockey?

159
00:06:38,590 --> 00:06:41,500
Well, not as a
power forward.

160
00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:47,690
Oh. We're flying the
friendly skies, are we?

161
00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:49,970
After you.

162
00:06:50,030 --> 00:06:51,830
(smacks lips)
why, thank you.

163
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:57,500
So, you're staying
at judith's.

164
00:06:57,570 --> 00:06:59,370
Yep.

165
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,310
What does she
say about me?

166
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:02,850
Well, if she's telling
the truth,

167
00:07:02,910 --> 00:07:05,880
We really shouldn't be drinking
out of the same cup.

168
00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:07,760
That might be
the nicest thing

169
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:10,590
She's ever
said about me.

170
00:07:10,650 --> 00:07:13,850
I just don't understand
what my brother sees in her.

171
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:18,960
You know, 15 years
ago i asked the exact
same question.

172
00:07:19,030 --> 00:07:20,500
A little tip?

173
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,590
Don't do it during
the wedding toast.

174
00:07:24,570 --> 00:07:26,910
Maybe you can clear
something up for me.

175
00:07:26,970 --> 00:07:29,740
Herb says you're
a successful jingle writer,

176
00:07:29,810 --> 00:07:31,780
But judith says you are

into a pit of money.

178
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:37,550
So what do you
need cleared up?

179
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:43,380
(clears throat)
boy, you got me
at a disadvantage.

180
00:07:43,450 --> 00:07:44,980
I don't know why
judith hates you.

181
00:07:45,050 --> 00:07:47,590
Hmm, it's hard to say.

182
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:49,400
Maybe it's 'cause
i'm smart.

183
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:51,670
Maybe it's because
i'm independent.

184
00:07:51,730 --> 00:07:54,040
Maybe it's because i offered my
brother a thousand dollars

185
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:55,770
To call off the wedding.

186
00:07:55,830 --> 00:07:58,730
I did the same thing
with my brother.

187
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:05,570
You did?

188
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:08,340
But the thought
was the same.

189
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:17,480
So, myra...
What do you do?

190
00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:19,920
I teach high school
economics.

191
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:21,600
Huh.

192
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:23,360
It may sound
like a boring life,

193
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:26,400
But at night, i dress up like
a giant spider and fight crime.

194
00:08:28,730 --> 00:08:31,360
Interesting. Now,
did you decide spider

195
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:32,830
And have the costume made

196
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:35,730
Or did you find the costume
and say, "okay, spider"?

197
00:08:37,470 --> 00:08:39,470
Are you mocking
the scarlet arachnid?

198
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:42,880
Sorry, sorry.

199
00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:45,490

that you're herb's sister.

201
00:08:47,550 --> 00:08:48,980
Hapless?

202
00:08:49,050 --> 00:08:53,820
I was going to say "tall,"
but hapless works.

203
00:08:53,890 --> 00:08:56,890
To hapless herb.

204
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,900
To the scarlet arachnid.

I was with this girl,
and i suddenly realized

353
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:21,910
That i'd rather be with
someone who i, you know,

354
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:23,950
Actually enjoy being with.

355
00:15:24,010 --> 00:15:26,510
Oh just forget it, alan;
you're useless.

356
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:28,780
(hangs up phone)
herb, do something!

357
00:15:28,850 --> 00:15:29,950
Hey.

358
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:33,420
I'm thinking about
going out for ice cream.

359
00:15:33,490 --> 00:15:35,160
Anyone want
to join me?

360
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:39,720
Charlie, when's the last time
you had a cone with sprinkles?

361
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:41,870
You know what, herb?
Judith can relax.

362
00:15:41,930 --> 00:15:43,690
I'm gonna check into a hotel.

363
00:15:43,770 --> 00:15:44,740
(sighs)
myra, no.

364
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,400
You don't have to do that.

365
00:15:46,470 --> 00:15:48,040
Yes, she does.

366
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:49,470
Hey, she's my sister!

367
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:50,980
She can stay as
long as she wants!

368
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:52,940
I really appreciate this.

369
00:15:53,010 --> 00:15:55,080
I'll go get my stuff.

370
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:56,440
Hey, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

371
00:15:56,510 --> 00:15:57,840
You don't have
to stay at a hotel.

372
00:15:57,910 --> 00:15:59,040
I got plenty of
room at my place.

373
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,620
Yeah, i'll bet you do.

374
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:02,050
N-N-No, no, no, no.

375
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:03,720
No strings attached.

376
00:16:03,790 --> 00:16:04,730
Really?

377
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:06,690
Really.

378
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:09,460
Still, i couldn't
impose like that.

379
00:16:09,530 --> 00:16:10,200
It's no imposition.

380
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:11,600
It's a big house.

381
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:12,790
There's plenty of room
for everybody.

382
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:13,930
You sure?

383
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,670
Absolutely.

384
00:16:15,730 --> 00:16:16,860
Okay, then.

385
00:16:16,930 --> 00:16:18,060
I'll be right back.

386
00:16:18,130 --> 00:16:19,600
Judith:
herb!

387
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:23,040
You want to come, too?

388
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:27,810
Are you nuts?

389
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:30,550
With myra out of the house,
i might get lucky tonight.

390
00:16:30,610 --> 00:16:32,040
Really?

391
00:16:32,110 --> 00:16:33,740
She seems pretty angry.

392
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:35,790
It's better when she's angry.

393
00:16:37,650 --> 00:16:39,750
Coming, pookie!

394
00:16:40,990 --> 00:16:42,890
♪ Men...

395
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:45,870
(toilet flushes)

396
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:49,590
This just sucks.

397
00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:52,670
It's just for a couple of
days till the wedding.

398
00:16:52,730 --> 00:16:54,800
Yeah, but why does she
have to stay in my room?

399
00:16:54,870 --> 00:16:56,770
Because... I don't know.

400
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:58,550
You're the kid.

401
00:16:58,610 --> 00:17:00,480
Yeah, well, it's not fair.

402
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:02,010
Yeah, well, get over it.

403
00:17:05,580 --> 00:17:07,780
Oh, my god!

404
00:17:07,850 --> 00:17:08,990
Jake, that's disgusting.

405
00:17:09,050 --> 00:17:10,880
Yeah, well, get over it.

406
00:17:13,790 --> 00:17:14,930
Go to sleep.

407
00:17:19,030 --> 00:17:20,800
Did you brush
your teeth?

408
00:17:20,860 --> 00:17:23,260
Dad, i'm asleep.

409
00:17:23,330 --> 00:17:25,160
Go brush your teeth.

410
00:17:25,230 --> 00:17:27,100
I can't; i don't have
my toothbrush.

411
00:17:27,170 --> 00:17:28,610
Well, go get it.

412
00:17:28,670 --> 00:17:29,900
Man!

413
00:17:29,970 --> 00:17:32,600
I have to do everything
around here.

414
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:43,710
Aunt myra?

415
00:17:43,790 --> 00:17:45,930
I have to get my toothbrush.

416
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:48,790
Aunt myra?

417
00:17:58,300 --> 00:18:00,060
Aunt myra?

418
00:18:04,310 --> 00:18:07,850
Huh.

419
00:18:07,910 --> 00:18:09,920
(humming)

420
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:11,890
Oh.

421
00:18:11,950 --> 00:18:13,890
Huh.

422
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,020
Hi.

423
00:18:16,090 --> 00:18:17,720
Hi.

424
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:20,550
Is everything okay?

425
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:21,720
Everything's fine.

426
00:18:21,790 --> 00:18:23,690
I just wanted to chat.

427
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:26,170
Oh. Okay.

428
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:28,570
I can go if you want.
No, no. No.

429
00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:29,860
No, this is fine.

430
00:18:29,930 --> 00:18:31,060
So...

431
00:18:31,130 --> 00:18:32,900
What's up?

432
00:18:32,970 --> 00:18:35,880
Well, we never really talked
about that kiss last night.

433
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:37,810
Right, right.

434
00:18:37,870 --> 00:18:39,900
That was a little
out of character for me.

435
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:42,950
Really? That's not
the word on the street.

436
00:18:44,810 --> 00:18:47,080
Okay, let me explain. Um...

437
00:18:47,150 --> 00:18:50,090
With me, kissing is usually
just a prelude to sex,

438
00:18:50,150 --> 00:18:53,080
But last night, sex was
the last thing on my mind.

439
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:56,100
Oh, gee, what girl doesn't
like to hear that?

440
00:18:56,160 --> 00:19:00,600
No, no. No, wait, let me finish.

441
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:03,060
I kissed you
because i really liked you,

442
00:19:03,130 --> 00:19:07,760
And i wanted to express
my... Liking of you.

443
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:09,680
Be still, my
beating heart.

444
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:11,610
Oh, come on, myra.

445
00:19:11,670 --> 00:19:13,740
I drove all the way
to judith's house to see you.

446
00:19:13,810 --> 00:19:15,320
And you know what's at judith's
house?

447
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:17,620
Judith!

448
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:19,350
That was very
brave of you.

449
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:21,090
Oh, no, it wasn't
brave, it was...

450
00:19:23,150 --> 00:19:25,620
To tell you the truth,
i don't know what it was,

451
00:19:25,690 --> 00:19:28,330
And i'm not really sure
what to do here.

452
00:19:28,390 --> 00:19:30,290
What do you
want to do here?

453
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:33,170
Let's forget about me
for a second.

454
00:19:33,230 --> 00:19:34,240
What about you?

455
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:35,240
What about me?

456
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:37,070
You kissed first.

457
00:19:37,130 --> 00:19:38,130
Why'd you do that?

458
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:40,830
Oh, i was plowed.

459
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:42,630
Really?

460
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:44,070
Oh, come on, you moron.

461
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:45,770
I'm sitting in the
middle of your bed

462
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:49,640
In my sexiest lingerie.

463
00:19:49,710 --> 00:19:51,140
All right.

464
00:19:51,210 --> 00:19:53,410
I'm pretty sure
i know what to do now.

465
00:19:56,890 --> 00:19:58,060
Charlie?

466
00:19:58,120 --> 00:19:59,780
Yeah?

467
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:02,800
I don't want to put any
pressure on you, but...

468
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:04,900
I'm a virgin.

469
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:09,770
You are?

470
00:20:09,830 --> 00:20:13,360
Man, you got to stop
sleeping with dumb girls.

471
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:15,410
It's rubbing off on you.

472
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:18,010
♪ Men...

473
00:20:22,810 --> 00:20:24,040
Aunt myra's not there.

474
00:20:24,110 --> 00:20:25,880
I'm sure she will be.

475
00:20:25,950 --> 00:20:28,220
She's probably just getting
something in the kitchen.

476
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:32,750
(bedsprings squeaking
rhythmically)

477
00:20:36,430 --> 00:20:38,060
That's not the kitchen.
