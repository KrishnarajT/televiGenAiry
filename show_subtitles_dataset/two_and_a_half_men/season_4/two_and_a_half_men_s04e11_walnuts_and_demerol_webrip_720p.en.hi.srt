Oh, right, the other part
of Christmas.

29
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:55,290
Go ahead, open it.

30
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:58,620
Hold on. Let me give you
your gift first.

31
00:01:58,690 --> 00:02:00,760
Don't want you think
I forgot you.

32
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:05,420
A hundred bucks? Wow!

33
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:08,420
Picked it out myself.

34
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:10,130
Now open yours.

35
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:12,470
Okay.

36
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:14,300
This is kind
of exciting.

37
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:21,110
"Fart in a Can"?

38
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:24,810
You don't have one, do you?

39
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:29,120
Well, I've got you.

40
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:31,080
But this is good for travel.

41
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:33,820
Jake, I just talked
to your mom.

42
00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:35,460
She's going to be
here any minute.

43
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,850
Don't look at
Uncle Charlie's gift.

44
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:38,120
You're getting the same thing.

45
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:40,860
Oh, boy, I'm excited.

46
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:42,600
Don't be.

47
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:44,530
Speaking of gifts...

48
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:47,510
Merry Christmas.

49
00:02:47,570 --> 00:02:49,510
I'll leave it up to you.

50
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:51,480
You can open it tomorrow
morning at your mom's, or...

51
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:57,140
you can rip it open with your
teeth like a rabid jackal.

52
00:02:57,210 --> 00:03:00,210
You got me the new Nintendo?

53
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:02,040
It's from Uncle Charlie, too.

54
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:04,510
You owe me $125.

55
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:06,510
But I just...

56
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:08,860
This is so cool!
Thanks, Dad!

57
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:10,080
Thanks, Uncle Charlie!

58
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:12,060
Yeah, yeah, merry Christmas.

59
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,790
I'm going to go hook it up.

60
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:15,590
No, no, no, you're leaving.

61
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:19,260
Your Uncle Charlie's
hooking up.

62
00:03:19,330 --> 00:03:20,860
You're leaving too, right?

63
00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:22,130
Yes, relax.

64
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,900
I plan on spending
Christmas Eve

65
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:25,230
at a movie theater
all by myself

66
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:26,940
just so you can have
sex tonight.

67
00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:29,080
You can have sex, too.

68
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:30,940
Just pick the right
movie theater.

69
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:32,540
(doorbell ringing)

70
00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:35,240
Jake, time to go.

71
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:38,190
Take some paper towels
and don't wear your suede shoes.

72
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:44,720
Ho, ho, ho.

73
00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:46,620
That's another option.

74
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,730
BOTH:
Merry Christmas.

75
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,200
Merry Christmas.
Come on in.

76
00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:53,770
Hey, merry Christmas,
Charlie.

77
00:03:53,830 --> 00:03:56,200
Yes, swell. I'll go get the kid.

78
00:03:56,270 --> 00:03:58,240
Ooh, eggnog.

79
00:03:58,310 --> 00:04:00,310
Honey, we've got
a long drive ahead of us.

80
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:02,170
We're spending the holidays
in San Diego with my parents.

81
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:04,270
That's why I need eggnog.

82
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:06,940
Hey, I spent Thanksgiving
with your parents.

83
00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:09,110
Oh, really? Your mom's
out of rehab?

84
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:11,980
Yes, my mom's out
of rehab.

85
00:04:12,050 --> 00:04:14,980
Actually, she kind
of jumped the fence.

86
00:04:15,050 --> 00:04:16,850
Well, the woman's going
to be your mother-in-law—

87
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,720
you might as well
get used to it.

88
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:21,620
Remember the time she rode out
of Betty Ford on a lawnmower?

89
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:26,690
On the plus side, she bakes
Toll House cookies

90
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:28,310
with walnuts and Demerol.

91
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:33,180
Stuff never goes back in
the box the way it came out.

92
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:35,580
It's a life lesson, Jake.

93
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:38,170
Come on, your mom's here.

94
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,210
Vamoose.

95
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,310
Okay, table's set
on the deck

96
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:45,680
and dinner's in
the oven.
Great.

97
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:47,850
You might want to keep the
candles away from the eggnog.

98
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,350
Got it.

99
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:52,020
All right then,
I'm leaving now.

100
00:04:52,090 --> 00:04:54,190
Good-bye and thanks.

101
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:56,020
Yeah, merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas.

102
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:59,300
All the best.
Same to you.

103
00:05:01,370 --> 00:05:03,680
Give me my bonus,
you blockhead.

104
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:08,050
Oh, right.

105
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:11,650
Thank you for all
your hard work.

106
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:19,820
Couldn't get along
without you.

107
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:25,350
You're one in a million.

108
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:30,970
Really?

109
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:33,030
What would Jesus do?

110
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:39,640
Herb?

111
00:05:39,710 --> 00:05:40,650
Oh, no thanks.
I'm driving.

112
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:41,880
I'll have some.

113
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:44,170
No, you won't.
It's for grownups.

114
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,340
I'll have another.

115
00:05:45,410 --> 00:05:47,210
Sweetie, my parents
are waiting.

116
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,090
I know, dear.

117
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:52,150
Apple doesn't fall far
from the tree, does it?

118
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:56,920
Okay, merry Christmas to all,

119
00:05:56,990 --> 00:06:00,100
and to all, a good-bye.

120
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,400
Hang on.

121
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:03,160
I've got a long bus ride,

122
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:05,270
and I don't want to sober up
halfway home.

123
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:06,330
KANDI:
Hello?

124
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,110
Kandi?

125
00:06:08,170 --> 00:06:09,670
What are you
doing here?

126
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:11,440
I didn't want to be alone
on Christmas Eve

127
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:13,330
and I didn't know
where else to go.

128
00:06:13,410 --> 00:06:15,050
Where's your new boyfriend?

129
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:17,280
He decided to spend Christmas
with his family.

130
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:19,010
Why didn't he
bring you along?

131
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:22,220
He thought it would make
his wife uncomfortable.

132
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:25,450
Oh. Sweetie,
come on in.

133
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:26,890
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

134
00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:28,080
I've got company coming,
remember?

135
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:29,320
I can't just throw
her out, Charlie.

136
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:31,260
How do you know
if you don't try?

137
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:33,760
Lighten up,
it's Christmas.

138
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:37,200
Okay, two minutes, and then I
bring out the Fart in a Can.

139
00:06:40,330 --> 00:06:44,300
ALAN:
You remember Judith.
Hi, Judith.

140
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:46,330
And this is her
fiancé, Herb.

141
00:06:46,410 --> 00:06:47,980
Hi, Herb.
Hi.

142
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,400
ALAN:
Here, let me
take your coat.

143
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:55,720
Oh, my golly.

144
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:59,080
Well, I guess we should
get going.

145
00:06:59,150 --> 00:07:01,280
What's the hurry?

146
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:02,980
Your parents are
waiting, remember?

147
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:06,730
What do you care?
They don't like you anyway.

148
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:07,890
Eggnog?

149
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:08,920
Thank you.

150
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,330
You're welcome.

151
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,100
I'm a doctor.

152
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,060
A real one or like Alan?

153
00:07:14,130 --> 00:07:17,200
I'm a pediatrician.

154
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:19,310
Wow, so you're into feet.

155
00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:21,470
No, children.

156
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:23,470
Isn't that illegal?

157
00:07:25,410 --> 00:07:27,910
Berta, don't you have
a bus to catch?

158
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:29,980
And miss this show?
Are you nuts?

159
00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:33,280
Feliz Navidad, everyone!

160
00:07:33,350 --> 00:07:37,620
Ooh, I didn't see
that one coming.

161
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:40,020
Mom, what are
you doing here?

162
00:07:40,090 --> 00:07:41,160
I was on my way to a party,

163
00:07:41,230 --> 00:07:42,770
thought I'd
drop off your gifts

164
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:44,370
so that I don't have to schlep
back here tomorrow

165
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:45,360
and mess up my day.

166
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:47,360
ROSE:
Charlie?

167
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:49,100
Rose?

168
00:07:49,170 --> 00:07:51,640
How could you have a Christmas
party and not invite me?

169
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:53,770
This isn't a Christmas party.

170
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:54,870
Well, what do you call it?

171
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:56,740
The beginning of a news story

172
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:58,420
that ends with the phrase,

173
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:00,920
"He then turned
the gun on himself.

174
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:03,440
All right, all right,
everybody listen up.

175
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:04,490
Listen to me.

176
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:07,010
There is no party.

177
00:08:07,090 --> 00:08:09,830
You all have to leave now
because a beautiful woman

178
00:08:09,890 --> 00:08:11,700
is coming over and I intend
to get her drunk

179
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:12,830
and have sex with her.

180
00:08:12,890 --> 00:08:14,920
WOMAN:
That's a good plan.

181
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:19,690
Except I'm already drunk.

182
00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:24,840
Boy, I can't wait
till the second act.

183
00:08:26,470 --> 00:08:28,270
♪ Men...

184
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:33,610
More fuel for the fire.

185
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:35,280
You said you were going home.

186
00:08:35,350 --> 00:08:37,790
Well, that was before I knew
you were having a party.

187
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:39,450
This isn't a party.

188
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:41,990
It's just a bunch of people
I don't like

189
00:08:42,050 --> 00:08:44,650
standing around drinking
my booze.

190
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,990
Oh, crap, it is a party.

191
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:48,330
Give me that.

192
00:08:52,430 --> 00:08:54,400
Love to know that those two
are talking about.

193
00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:55,340
I could tell you.

194
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:56,400
I read lips.

195
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:59,410
Really?
Yep.

196
00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:00,900
Right now your date

197
00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:02,400
is saying

198
00:09:02,470 --> 00:09:06,740
"The wily ostrich
sank my boat."

199
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:11,920
I have a little congestion
in my upper chest.

200
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:13,480
Can you take a look at it?

201
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:15,020
Oh, well, I could...

202
00:09:15,090 --> 00:09:17,930
Kandi, he's a pediatrician.
He only treats children.

203
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:19,320
Now hold on.

204
00:09:19,390 --> 00:09:21,790
There's no actual age limit.

205
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:25,390
I took an oath to ease
suffering wherever I find it.

206
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:27,970
Alan, a word.

207
00:09:28,030 --> 00:09:30,700
Oh, good... a word.

208
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:35,050
I don't have
my stethoscope,

209
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:37,680
so why don't you just
breathe in and out for me.

210
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:42,590
Make this stop.

211
00:09:42,650 --> 00:09:45,760
I'm sorry. I don't know
what you're talking about.

212
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:47,390
Don't screw with me.

213
00:09:47,450 --> 00:09:49,850
Tell your ex-wife to stop
flirting with my fiancé.

214
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,490
Gee, that's funny.

215
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:52,960
The way I see it,

216
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:55,770
your peanut butter is
all over my chocolate.

217
00:09:55,830 --> 00:09:58,440
Damn it, Alan, I can
make your life a living hell.

218
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:01,640
How would I know
the difference?

219
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:04,130
Cough again.

220
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:06,130
Once more.

221
00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:09,010
Let's have a little pow-wow.

222
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:12,080
She might have a touch
of the croup.

223
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:14,040
Listen, Herb...
So you were married
to her?

224
00:10:14,110 --> 00:10:15,810
Yes, we were married.

225
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:17,910
Judith is getting
really upset with you.

226
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:20,480
So you got to see
her naked?

227
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:22,050
Stay with me, Herb.

228
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:24,090
Your fiancée is
very angry.

229
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:26,100
Really? How come?

230
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,030
Oh, I don't know,
maybe it's because

231
00:10:28,090 --> 00:10:30,090
you were trying use
Kandi's nipple as a Q-tip.

232
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,060
It's okay, I'm a doctor.

233
00:10:32,130 --> 00:10:33,730
Just do yourself
a favor—

234
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:36,530
go pay attention
to Judith.

235
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,470
All right.

236
00:10:41,070 --> 00:10:42,970
Some party, huh?

237
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:45,910
Yeah, I'm glad I didn't waste
this buzz on the bus.

238
00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:48,690
Here comes your mom.

239
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:50,920
Act like you didn't
know what they were saying.

240
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:52,050
Charlie, I must
talk to you.

241
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:54,690
I know. Why is that?

242
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:57,690
How serious is your
relationship with Gloria?

243
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,160
Not that it's any
of your business,

244
00:10:59,230 --> 00:11:00,600
but this is our
second date.

245
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,170
What happened on the first date?

246
00:11:02,230 --> 00:11:04,100
They went out to dinner,
he took her home

247
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,090
and they made out
a little bit in the car.

248
00:11:06,170 --> 00:11:08,740
Oh, I'm sorry, did
you want to tell it?

249
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:11,100
So, you haven't slept together?

250
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:11,970
Not yet.

251
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:14,810
Oops. There I go again.

252
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:16,840
That's good. Uh, darling,

253
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:18,920
you need to end
this relationship now.

254
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:20,150
Why?

255
00:11:22,050 --> 00:11:22,990
Do you trust me?

256
00:11:23,050 --> 00:11:25,820
ALL:
No.

257
00:11:25,890 --> 00:11:27,520
Okay, but you know I have

258
00:11:27,590 --> 00:11:29,130
your best interests
at heart, don't you?

259
00:11:29,190 --> 00:11:31,000
ALL:
No.

260
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:34,000
All right, then,
let me put it this way.

261
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:37,060
I forbid you to see
this woman any more.

262
00:11:37,130 --> 00:11:38,500
You forbid?

263
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,130
What gives you
the right to forbid?

264
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,640
I'm 39 years old.

265
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:43,030
I'm your mother. You're 40.

266
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:46,000
And you must not see
this woman anymore!

267
00:11:46,070 --> 00:11:48,470
Mom, you know that just
makes me want her more.

268
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:49,970
Charlie, I mean it.

269
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:51,710
I'm getting hotter.

270
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:55,750
Look, I know certain things
about Gloria's past

271
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:58,190
which are, well, unsavory.

272
00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:00,180
Okay, I'm going supernova.

273
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:02,950
Would you listen to me?

274
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:05,920
If you continue
to see this woman,

275
00:12:05,990 --> 00:12:07,890
it will hurt me, deeply.

276
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:10,830
I may have to marry this girl.

277
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:11,970
Okay. Okay.

278
00:12:12,030 --> 00:12:14,100
You give me no choice.

279
00:12:14,170 --> 00:12:15,770
Who are you calling?

280
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:17,740
It's probably
about the ostrich in the boat.

281
00:12:19,310 --> 00:12:21,550
Charlie, I'm getting
pretty drunk,

282
00:12:21,610 --> 00:12:25,250
so if you like a girl who moves,
you better do me soon.

283
00:12:25,310 --> 00:12:26,940
Follow me.

284
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,750
Ah... isn't that sweet?

285
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:33,990
Every time a guy has sex,
an angel gets a stiffy.

286
00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:38,630
Would you look at them?

287
00:12:38,690 --> 00:12:41,120
Oh, I completely forgot
about the subplot.

288
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:44,300
What do you want me
to do, Judith?

289
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:46,190
He's your man. You want him?
Fight for him.

290
00:12:46,270 --> 00:12:47,870
How can I
compete with that?

291
00:12:47,930 --> 00:12:48,600
There's no competition.

292
00:12:48,670 --> 00:12:50,010
Herb loves you.

293
00:12:50,070 --> 00:12:52,040
You have a mature,
sophisticated relationship

294
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:53,730
based on mutual respect.

295
00:12:53,810 --> 00:12:55,180
All Kandi has is...

296
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:59,620
There'll be other men.

297
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:02,590
Just get here
as soon as you can.

298
00:13:02,650 --> 00:13:04,860
Where's Charlie?

299
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:07,690
Damn it!

300
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:09,120
Oh, I get it.

301
00:13:09,190 --> 00:13:11,000
It's like Tony and
Tina's Wedding.

302
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:12,560
You gotta follow
them around.

303
00:13:14,190 --> 00:13:15,990
Hey. Mommio. Daddio.

304
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:17,220
Hi, buddy.

305
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:19,200
Mommio. Daddio, Daddio.

306
00:13:19,270 --> 00:13:22,710
Mommio, Mommio. Daddio...

307
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,910
Stop!

308
00:13:26,970 --> 00:13:28,140
Mom!

309
00:13:28,210 --> 00:13:30,180
Get out of that bed
this instant!

310
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:33,170
I don't think
that's a good idea.

311
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:35,120
Charlie, I'm
warning you.

312
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:38,250
You can't tell him what
to do— he's 34 years old.

313
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,620
He's what?

314
00:13:39,690 --> 00:13:40,990
She's drunk.

315
00:13:42,690 --> 00:13:44,260
Mom, what are
you doing here?

316
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:47,050
I'm trying to keep you from
making a horrible mistake.

317
00:13:47,130 --> 00:13:48,600
What do you care?

318
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:50,020
I make this mistake
on a regular basis.

319
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:51,900
Some might call it
a lifestyle.

320
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:53,960
Charlie...
I don't want
to hear it.

321
00:13:54,030 --> 00:13:55,800
I came up here to do a job.

322
00:13:55,870 --> 00:13:57,170
Actually, two jobs
and a chore.

323
00:13:57,240 --> 00:14:00,610
Now, you can stay and watch,

324
00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:02,870
which I don't recommend,
or you can leave.

325
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:06,340
Either way, Gloria and I
are going to have sex.

326
00:14:09,150 --> 00:14:11,120
Go ahead.

327
00:14:13,050 --> 00:14:14,320
Okay, I'm bluffing.

328
00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:18,860
He sure is.

You told me to

Alan, would you please
close the door?

Sorry.

00:15:41,810 --> 00:15:43,010
At the time you were busy

358
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:44,420
learning to use
the big-boy potty.

359
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:46,350
Ah. Well.

360
00:15:46,410 --> 00:15:48,280
I did it.

361
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:52,360
Good job.

362
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:55,490
Uh, listen, Alan, I'm
looking for my daughter.

363
00:15:55,550 --> 00:15:57,350
Drunk blonde?

364
00:15:57,420 --> 00:16:00,720
Well, she isn't
always blonde.

365
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:03,820
Upstairs.

366
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:05,500
Thank you.

367
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:06,990
You know,

368
00:16:07,070 --> 00:16:10,010
you turned out to be
a very attractive man.

369
00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:11,080
Um, thank you.

370
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:13,010
Coulda gone either way.

371
00:16:13,070 --> 00:16:16,040
Lucky you grew
into those ears.

372
00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:20,120
(playing same tune)

373
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:22,890
♪ Frosty the Snowman

374
00:16:22,950 --> 00:16:26,160
♪ Was a very jolly soul

375
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:30,330
♪ With a corncob pipe

376
00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:33,860
♪ And two eyes
made out of coal... ♪

377
00:16:33,930 --> 00:16:35,200
Damn it, Charlie,
you don't know what

378
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:36,860
you're getting into here.

379
00:16:36,930 --> 00:16:39,270
Oh, I think I have
a pretty good idea.

380
00:16:39,330 --> 00:16:41,330
I mean, what could you possibly
tell me about Gloria

381
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:43,400
that would get me
to kick her out of bed?

382
00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:45,780
She's married? Clinically
insane? She's a man?

383
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:47,010
You're not a
man, are you?
Nope.

384
00:16:47,070 --> 00:16:48,840
Then we're good.

385
00:16:48,910 --> 00:16:50,380
Gloria, get out
of that bed.

386
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:51,370
Mom?

387
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,370
"Mom"?

388
00:16:53,450 --> 00:16:54,550
Well, did you tell them?

389
00:16:54,610 --> 00:16:56,440
I tried, but I couldn't.
Why not?

390
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:58,460
What do you mean, why
not? Why do you think?

391
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:00,790
Oh, so, as usual, I have
to do your dirty work.

392
00:17:00,850 --> 00:17:01,880
You can't sleep with him

393
00:17:01,950 --> 00:17:03,280
because he might
be your brother.

394
00:17:05,620 --> 00:17:07,490
There, was that so hard?

395
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:10,970
It's certainly not hard for
someone who has no shame.

396
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:13,400
Says the woman who
killed my husband.

397
00:17:13,470 --> 00:17:15,010
I did not kill Sherman.

398
00:17:15,070 --> 00:17:16,910
I made Sherman happy.

399
00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:19,010
Excuse me, excuse me.
Hold on. Hold on.

400
00:17:19,070 --> 00:17:22,270
Can we go back to the part
where I may be her brother?

401
00:17:22,340 --> 00:17:23,870
Oh, dear Lord,
has the blood

402
00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:25,540
not returned
to your brain yet?

403
00:17:25,610 --> 00:17:27,070
It was the '70s.

404
00:17:27,150 --> 00:17:28,890
We were young,
attractive couples

405
00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:30,350
and there was
a gas shortage

406
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:32,560
so we had to
"entertain" at home.

407
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:34,560
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

408
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:38,090
Are you saying you
and her husband...?

409
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:41,100
Yes, and she and
your father.

410
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,890
Blame OPEC.

411
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,530
It started with a
weekly fondue party,

412
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:49,440
but one night the dipping
didn't stop at cheese.

413
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:53,930
Unfortunately, some of
us couldn't handle it.

414
00:17:54,010 --> 00:17:56,180
You did unspeakable
things with Sherman

415
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,140
and then he wanted
to do them with me.

416
00:17:58,210 --> 00:18:00,010
Oh, nonsense.

417
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:01,850
I just raised
the bar a bit.

418
00:18:01,910 --> 00:18:03,210
Raised the bar?

419
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:05,150
Do you have any idea how
many third-world countries

420
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:06,590
that man visited trying
to find someone else

421
00:18:06,650 --> 00:18:08,050
who would do those things?

422
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:10,020
Oh, he didn't
have to go abroad.

423
00:18:10,090 --> 00:18:11,330
He was just looking
for a bargain.

424
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:13,020
If it weren't for you

425
00:18:13,090 --> 00:18:15,990
he would never have contracted
amoebic dysentery and died.

426
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:18,890
I hate to interrupt,
but I'm still trying

427
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:21,900
to process the
"I'm her brother" thing.

428
00:18:21,970 --> 00:18:23,140
Mmm.

429
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,600
Not the shiniest penny
in the roll, is he?

430
00:18:25,670 --> 00:18:27,070
All right.

431
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:28,980
I guess I better
spell it out for you.

432
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:31,000
Based on the amount
of time that elapsed

433
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:34,150
between the last fondue party
and Gloria's birth,

434
00:18:34,210 --> 00:18:36,010
and not to mention
the fact that Sherman

435
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:39,180
lost interest in
traditional sex with me...

436
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:40,610
Thank you very much.

437
00:18:40,690 --> 00:18:44,030
There is the very real
possibility

438
00:18:44,090 --> 00:18:46,200
that your father
may be her father.

439
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:48,030
Oh, my God.
Wow.

440
00:18:48,090 --> 00:18:50,220
So you can see why a
tryst of this nature

441
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:52,040
is completely
unacceptable.

442
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:55,210
It's not like we couldn't
have foreseen this,

443
00:18:55,270 --> 00:18:57,910
given that your son has spent
the bulk of his adult life

444
00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:00,480
humping his way through
the greater Los Angeles area.

445
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:05,510
Oh, and like this booze-addled
tart is an innocent victim.

446
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:08,220
Hey, I'm drunk, not deaf.

447
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:11,110
Just get out of bed
and get dressed.

448
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:14,650
Well, that
was humiliating.

449
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,520
Just be glad we didn't
have to tell them

450
00:19:16,590 --> 00:19:18,160
about our little experiment.

451
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:19,350
EVELYN:
Don't remind me.

452
00:19:19,430 --> 00:19:21,130
Oh, you loved it.

453
00:19:21,190 --> 00:19:23,420
Oh, a third-act twist.

454
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:27,030
Wow.

455
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:28,710
Yeah.

456
00:19:28,770 --> 00:19:32,040
I am so horny right now
I can't believe it.

457
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:33,630
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

458
00:19:33,710 --> 00:19:37,580
Did you miss what just
went down here... Sis?

459
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:40,670
Oh, come on. It's not like
we're gonna get married

460
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:43,020
and have a bunch
of web-footed kids..

461
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:47,410
You have absolutely no
boundaries, do you?

462
00:19:47,490 --> 00:19:51,230
Well... I don't
like fat guys.

463
00:19:51,290 --> 00:19:55,020
Interesting.

464
00:19:55,090 --> 00:19:58,360
Turns out...
I draw the line at incest.

465
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:01,570
So you'd do a fat guy?

466
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:06,110
Do you hear that?

467
00:20:06,170 --> 00:20:07,670
Charlie found
his boundary.

468
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:09,380
It's a miracle.

469
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:11,140
A Christmas miracle.

470
00:20:21,190 --> 00:20:24,660
Judith, can I just say that this
was the best Christmas ever.

471
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:27,350
Yeah, well,
don't get used to it.

472
00:20:27,430 --> 00:20:29,670
"'Twas the night
before Christmas

473
00:20:29,730 --> 00:20:31,270
"And all through the house

474
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:33,390
Not a creature was stirring..."

475
00:20:33,470 --> 00:20:35,410
(vomiting)

476
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:39,740
Okay, just so we're clear.

477
00:20:39,810 --> 00:20:42,310
We are only doing this
to piss off my mom?

478
00:20:42,370 --> 00:20:44,370
You have a problem with that?

479
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:49,180
No, that makes it better.
