I can stay.

Yeah, I wish you could...

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,300
but there's no way

6
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:20,070

Okay, well,

What do you think?

I think you'll call.

23
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:56,870
Well, there you go.

24
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:01,450
So when will you call?
Soon.

How soon?
We're back on

So where'd you find this one?

34
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:27,280
The animal shelter.

35
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:29,240
So, we getting a pet?

36
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:32,180
Are you crazy?
We've already got your kid.

37
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:35,220
Then what were you doing there?

38
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,150
Standing within earshot
of attractive women

39
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:41,990
and mumbling, "Gee, I wish
I could adopt them all."

40
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:46,020
It's foolproof.

41
00:01:46,090 --> 00:01:49,020
Listen, there's something
I need to talk to you about.

42
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:51,400
You know the difference
between you and me, Alan?

43
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:53,460
I don't scream
when I pee?

44
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:55,930
I took care of that.

00:01:57,370 --> 00:01:59,900
No, the difference
between you and me

46
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:02,900
is I have vision—
I see what others don't.

47
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:04,550
Terrific. Anyway, the thing
I wanted to tell you...

48
00:02:04,610 --> 00:02:06,470
You look at an animal
shelter and see

49
00:02:06,550 --> 00:02:08,890
homeless dogs and
kitties about to
be put to death.

50

00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:14,360

00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:58,260
I'll call you.

183
00:07:58,330 --> 00:08:01,200
Soon.

184
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:03,610
Very soon.

185
00:08:03,670 --> 00:08:04,630
See?

186
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:06,400
Was that so hard?

187
00:08:06,470 --> 00:08:08,370
Well, to be fair,
you had the advantage

188
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:10,540
of making it
a performance piece.

189
00:08:10,610 --> 00:08:12,640
Hey, dawgs.

190
00:08:12,710 --> 00:08:13,880
Hey.
Hey, Jake.

191
00:08:13,950 --> 00:08:15,820
Alan, here, I need you
to sign these papers

192
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:17,980
for Jake's summer school.

193
00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:19,680
Summer school, again?

194
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:21,850
Why not?
He's getting good at it.

195
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:22,880
Oh, my Lord.

196
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,930
Who is that?

197
00:08:24,990 --> 00:08:26,990
That's my handyman.

198
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:29,430
Really? I've been looking
for a good handyman.

199
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:31,240
Well, it's a little
soon to know how good he is...

200
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:32,440
I'll find out.

201
00:08:34,370 --> 00:08:36,670
I'm starting to see
a trend here.

202
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:42,410
♪ Besame, besame mucho ♪

203
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:45,720
♪ Como si fuera
esta noche... ♪

204
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:48,490
That boney bitch!

205
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:57,320
Yep, definitely a trend.

206
00:08:59,590 --> 00:09:01,790
♪ Men.

207
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:04,490
Summer school
three years in a row.

208
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:09,530
They might as well just
make you the janitor.

209
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,430
Yeah, well, school sucks.

210
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:13,330
That's because you go
year-round.

211
00:09:14,970 --> 00:09:17,270
Imagine if you had a couple
months off in the summer.

212
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:20,320
If I were you,
I'd start teaching him

213
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:21,590
how to throw sawdust on vomit.

214
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:24,760
I can do that.

215
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:27,460
Why don't you just go
start your homework?

216
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:28,780
What's the point?

217
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:29,490
I'm already going
to summer school.

218
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:30,830
Jake...

219
00:09:30,890 --> 00:09:32,690
And if I flunk there,
what can they do?

220
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:33,830
Send me to regular school?

221
00:09:33,890 --> 00:09:35,620
Go.

222
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:40,500
Actually, that sawdust job
may be a pipe dream.

223
00:09:42,670 --> 00:09:45,040
Is the big one gone?

224
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:49,440
Yeah, she went to get
something waxed.

225
00:09:50,710 --> 00:09:52,810
We were scared to ask what.

226
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,490
I just wanted to tell you

227
00:09:54,550 --> 00:09:56,420
I was able to save you
some money on the redwood.

228
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:57,780
Oh, that's terrific. How?

229
00:09:57,850 --> 00:10:01,680
My cousin— he works
at a lumberyard and...

230
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:03,990
that's all you need to know.

231
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:06,100
Well, thanks.

232
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:07,830
No problem.
I'll get back to work.

233
00:10:07,890 --> 00:10:09,920
I like this guy.

234
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,470
Of course you do.

235
00:10:11,530 --> 00:10:12,760
What's that supposed
to mean?

236
00:10:12,830 --> 00:10:14,830
Charlie, he's a younger version
of you.

237
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:18,500
Oh yeah, that must be it.

238
00:10:18,570 --> 00:10:20,100
(doorbell ringing)
JAKE:
I'll get it.

239
00:10:20,170 --> 00:10:23,070
There you go.
He could be a doorman.

240
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:25,510
Charlie, I really
don't appreciate...

241
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:26,750
I'm not saying right away.

242
00:10:26,810 --> 00:10:28,910
He could work his way up
from doorstop.

243
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:30,680
Uncle Charlie,
it's Chloe.

244
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:32,750
Aw, geez, did you let her in?

245
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:34,130
No, she's on the front porch.

246
00:10:34,190 --> 00:10:35,490
I told her I'd see
if you were home.

247
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:36,830
Attaboy.

248
00:10:36,890 --> 00:10:39,600
See? He'll make doorman
in no time.

249
00:10:40,690 --> 00:10:41,820
She brought soup.

250
00:10:41,890 --> 00:10:44,060
Why would she
bring soup?

251
00:10:44,130 --> 00:10:45,730
You told her
you had a bug.

252
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:47,470
So she assumed
it was bronchial.

253
00:10:47,530 --> 00:10:49,530
If you'd been more specific,
like I suggested,

254
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,600
you could have precluded this.

255
00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:55,700
Nobody just drops by when
they think you have diarrhea.

256
00:10:57,910 --> 00:11:01,080
And I bet they don't
bring soup either.

257
00:11:01,150 --> 00:11:05,390
All right, all right, I'm
gonna sneak out the back door.

258
00:11:05,450 --> 00:11:07,520
Just tell her I had a
doctor's appointment.

259
00:11:07,590 --> 00:11:08,790
GP or specialist?

260
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:12,860
Alan, I swear to God,
I will rip off your head

261
00:11:12,930 --> 00:11:15,170
and use your neck
as a bedpan.

262
00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:17,940
Charlie, you cannot keep lying
to this girl forever.

263
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Oh, I think I can.

264
00:11:20,070 --> 00:11:21,710
Just go out there and tell her

265
00:11:21,770 --> 00:11:23,040
you're not interested
in a relationship

266
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:24,030
and be done with it.

267
00:11:25,610 --> 00:11:27,480
Yeah... I guess
you're right.

268
00:11:28,910 --> 00:11:31,120
I say we eat the soup
before you tell her.

269
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:36,740
Smelled like minestrone.

270
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:39,120
Listen, Chloe,
we need to talk...

271
00:11:41,690 --> 00:11:42,660

272
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:43,950

273
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,840
Looks like your
problem's solved.

274
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:52,700
Are you crazy?

275
00:11:52,770 --> 00:11:54,770
That rat bastard
is stealing my girlfriend.

276
00:11:56,870 --> 00:11:59,610

Yeah, well,

that's what
friends are for.

281
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:16,530
So, um, Charlie, did you know
that Fernando volunteers

282
00:12:16,590 --> 00:12:18,900
to build homeless shelters
in his spare time?

283
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:20,670
No, I didn't.

284
00:12:20,730 --> 00:12:23,600
Did you know
his cousin steals wood?

285
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:25,630
Really?

286
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:27,810
That is fascinating.

00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:30,840
Why don't you come on
inside, so we can visit.

288
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:32,900
I'll see you later,
Fernando.

289
00:12:32,970 --> 00:12:35,140
Well, thank you for
your thoughtful soup.

290
00:12:35,210 --> 00:12:38,420
It nourishes my body as
your beauty nourishes my soul.

293
00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:48,620
So, Chloe, what's new?

294
00:12:48,690 --> 00:12:50,560
Huh? Oh, nothing.

295
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:53,760
What is he, like, Colombian?

296
00:12:53,830 --> 00:12:55,470
I don't know.

297
00:12:55,530 --> 00:12:57,940
But I gotta tell you, I do
feel much better seeing you.

298
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,140

00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:06,140
Yeah, kinda creepy.

301
00:13:06,210 --> 00:13:09,510
The way he speaks,
it's so romantic.

302
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:14,190
Hey, I almost forgot.

303
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:15,990
I wrote you a song.

304
00:13:16,050 --> 00:13:17,890

305
00:13:17,950 --> 00:13:19,580
Well, Chloe, you've been
on my mind a lot,

306
00:13:19,650 --> 00:13:21,680

Yeah.

337

That's what I'm feeling.

338
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:02,330
Oh! Hey, listen, Charlie,
I was thinking—

339
00:15:02,390 --> 00:15:03,830
after Fernando's done
with the deck,

340
00:15:03,890 --> 00:15:05,820
he could patch that hole
in the roof

341
00:15:05,890 --> 00:15:07,550
where the squirrels get in.

342
00:15:07,630 --> 00:15:08,570
I don't think so.

343
00:15:08,630 --> 00:15:09,670
Why not?

344
00:15:09,730 --> 00:15:11,140
I like squirrels.

345
00:15:13,030 --> 00:15:14,730
Hey, me too.

346
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:17,930
But they get into
the crawl space,

347
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,300
where they breed and die.

348
00:15:19,370 --> 00:15:21,640
That's what I like
about 'em, Alan.

349
00:15:23,210 --> 00:15:25,880
I like their little hands.

350
00:15:25,950 --> 00:15:28,190
Come on, Charlie,
all Fernando would have to do—

351
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:30,650
Forget Fernando.

352
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,660
I'm having second thoughts about
him even finishing the deck.

353
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,690
What, you want to fire him?

354
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:36,350
I don't want to...

355
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:38,720
I just don't think his
work is very professional.

356
00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:40,720
I mean,
he's wasting a lot of wood.

357
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:43,090
And you know, wood doesn't
just grow on tree...

358
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:44,890
He's gotta go.

359
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:46,660
Charlie, you're not
fooling anybody.

360
00:15:46,730 --> 00:15:47,660
You're jealous.

361
00:15:47,730 --> 00:15:49,000
Jealous?

362
00:15:49,070 --> 00:15:50,670
You know what's cooler
than squirrels?

363
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:53,680
Anteaters.
They're just crazy-lookin'.

364
00:15:55,670 --> 00:15:57,040
I'm not jealous.

365
00:15:57,110 --> 00:15:59,620
And their name tells you
what to feed 'em.

366
00:16:02,050 --> 00:16:03,750
Why would you say I'm jealous?

367
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:06,060
I'm an omnivore.
That means I eat anything.

368
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:07,790
Yeah, we've noticed.
Now shut up.

369
00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:10,350
I'm not jealous.

370
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:12,190
Charlie, you want
to fire this guy

371
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:13,870
just because he's younger
and better-looking than you.

372
00:16:13,930 --> 00:16:15,070
And he can sing.

373
00:16:15,130 --> 00:16:17,230
This has nothing to do
with that.

374
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:18,670
And I can sing too.

375
00:16:18,730 --> 00:16:20,660
Yeah, but you stink.

00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:22,730

377
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,000
Hey, I'm done for the day.

378
00:16:24,070 --> 00:16:25,270
I'll see you in the morning?

379
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:26,780
Hold on, Fernando.

380
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:28,780
I want to talk to you.

381
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:30,670
Yes?

382
00:16:32,710 --> 00:16:34,110
Never mind.
Good night.

383
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:35,780
Is there a problem?

384
00:16:35,850 --> 00:16:38,960
Because I want everything
to be perfect for you.

385
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:40,960
You're a good man
and I respect you.

386
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:42,950
You remind me
of my sainted father.

387
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:46,760
Thank you.

388
00:16:46,830 --> 00:16:50,730
He was wise and strong until
syphilis made him crazy.

389
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:55,000
Again, thanks.

390
00:16:55,070 --> 00:16:56,110
Good night.

Buenas noches.

392
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:03,300
I thought you were
gonna get rid of him.

393
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:06,820
Or did you go crazy there
for a second?

394
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:09,720
I don't know,
I just...

395
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:11,210
I just couldn't.
Yeah,

396
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,980
I think it's his eyes.

397
00:17:13,050 --> 00:17:14,820
It's like they're looking
right into my soul.

398
00:17:14,890 --> 00:17:16,290
That's what Mom said.

399
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:20,390
Women used to say that
about my eyes.

400
00:17:20,460 --> 00:17:22,700
Really?

401
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:25,090
'Cause now they're kind of milky
and bloodshot.

402
00:17:26,830 --> 00:17:28,200
Actually, the one on the right

403
00:17:28,270 --> 00:17:29,440
is starting to look
a little lazy.

404
00:17:30,970 --> 00:17:32,470
You know, you're right.

405
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:35,050
Okay, okay, that's enough.

406
00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:36,450

you can't expect

407
00:17:36,510 --> 00:17:38,120
to compete with a guy
half your age.

408
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:39,920
I am not competing.

409
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:42,250
Well, you shouldn't,
because it's perfectly natural.

When you're too old
to chase the buffalo,

414
00:17:52,290 --> 00:17:56,720
it's time to stay back with the
old women and make necklaces.

415

Necklaces?

416
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:01,770
Or weave blankets,
tend the fire,

417
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:04,430
teach the kids to whittle...

418
00:18:06,070 --> 00:18:07,770
Buffaloes are cool, too.

419
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:09,450

in the neighborhood,
