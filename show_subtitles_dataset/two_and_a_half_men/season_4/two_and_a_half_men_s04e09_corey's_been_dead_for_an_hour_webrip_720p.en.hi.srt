1
00:00:03,260 --> 00:00:07,030
Nachos, Red Hots, Milk Duds,
popcorn and a slushy.

2
00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:11,160
What are you doing,
building an ass bomb?

3
00:00:11,230 --> 00:00:12,430
Pick two.

4
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:14,430
Okay, popcorn and Milk Duds.

5
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:15,000
Fine.

6
00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:15,840
Large popcorn.

7
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:17,000
Okay.

8
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:18,600
But I'll still need a slushy

9
00:00:18,670 --> 00:00:20,700
so I don't choke to death
on a Milk Dud.

10
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:22,040
All right.

11
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:23,980
And ask then to put nacho cheese
on the popcorn.

12
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:27,190
Oh, that reminds me.
I've got a date tonight.

13
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:30,160
That reminds you?

14
00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:32,160
Yeah, and I'm gonna need
your help.

15
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:33,180
My help?

16
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:34,980
Next.
Hang on.

17
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:38,160
Uh, a large popcorn
with cheese,

18
00:00:38,230 --> 00:00:41,170
a large slushy and a jumbo box
of Milk Duds.

19
00:00:41,230 --> 00:00:42,130
You want anything?
My treat.

20
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:43,800
I'm okay.

21
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:45,860
I'll just eat whatever lands
on the kid's shirt.

22
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:47,230
You're gonna go hungry.

23
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:50,030
That's it.

24
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:51,570
So what about this date?

25
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:53,780
Well, she got a friend
visiting from out of town.

26
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:55,170
I said, "Fine," you know?

27
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:57,810
Two's company.
Three's a sandwich.

28
00:00:57,880 --> 00:00:59,120
But for some reason,

29
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:00,850
she insists on her friend
having her own date.

30
00:01:00,910 --> 00:01:01,980
So you're asking me?

31
00:01:02,050 --> 00:01:03,160
Yeah.

32
00:01:03,220 --> 00:01:05,490
The two of us out
making the scene

33
00:01:05,550 --> 00:01:06,220
with a couple hot chicks?

34
00:01:06,290 --> 00:01:08,260
Oh, Lord. Never mind.

35
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:09,850
Don't be silly.
It'll be fun.

36
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:10,890
We never double.

37
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:12,270
That's not an accident, Alan.

38
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:13,970
Come on.
Please, please, please?

39
00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:15,930
All right, all right.
Save your begging
for the date.

40
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,140
I never beg.

41
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,640
I grovel.

42
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:20,210
Oh!

43
00:01:20,270 --> 00:01:22,140
I guess I'll have to find
a baby-sitter for Jake.

44
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:24,570
I don't need a baby-sitter.
Nothing's going to happen to me.

45
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:27,250
Who's worried about you?
I'm worried about my house.

46
00:01:27,310 --> 00:01:28,750
It's $24.50.

47
00:01:28,810 --> 00:01:31,520
Whoa. Okay.

48
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:33,650
Oh, geez!

49
00:01:33,710 --> 00:01:35,040
What?

50
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:37,090
I walked out of the house
without my wallet.

51
00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:37,950
Can you believe it?

52
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:40,830
Strangely enough, I can.

53
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:42,800
$24.50, please.

54
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:44,900
Hang on.
I know what happened.

55
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:47,100
Because you drove,
it didn't occur to me
to pick up my wallet.

56
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:49,860
The only reason
I drove was because

57
00:01:49,930 --> 00:01:52,260
you said your car
was low on gas.

58
00:01:52,330 --> 00:01:54,600
$24.50, please.

59
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:55,740
Just a minute.

60
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,070
You said you'd pay
for parking,

61
00:01:57,140 --> 00:01:58,710
which now you won't
be able to do

62
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:00,000
because you forgot
your wallet.

63
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:01,170
Don't make
a big deal of it.

64
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:02,310
I'll pay for parking
next time.

65
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:03,820
That's what you said
last time.

66
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:05,820
Yes, but this time
I forgot my wallet.

67
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:08,220
CROWD:
$24.50, please.

68
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:13,320
Fine, I'll pay.

69
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:15,090
Ooh, you know what?

70
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:18,860
Why don't you throw in
a bagel dog make it an even $30?

78
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:50,700
Bye.

79
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:52,530
I'm trusting you to act
responsibly

80
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:53,890
and go to bed
at a reasonable hour.

81
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,990
Okay.

82
00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:59,560
You know, this is a real
turning point for you.

83
00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:01,960
You're taking care
of yourself.

84
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:03,680
You're becoming a man.

85
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:06,680
You, too.

86
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:09,610
Boy, it seems
like only yesterday

87
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,650
that I was bringing you home
from the hospital.

88
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:14,740
You were, you were like
a little wrinkly pig with colic.

89
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:17,790
Yeah. You going or not?

90
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:20,760
You ready?

91
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:21,820
Hang on.

92
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:25,790
Good-bye, my son.

93
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:29,470
Save it for the date, Dad.

94
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:35,430
Don't burn the place down,
and if you do,

95
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:37,470
don't be here
when I get back.

96
00:03:38,810 --> 00:03:42,350
He knows to drink
the cheap Scotch,

97
00:03:42,410 --> 00:03:43,510
not the single malt, right?

98
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:44,380
That's not funny.

99
00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:45,720
I'm not joking.

100
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:47,020
He's probably just
going to mix it

101
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:48,680
with Hawaiian Punch
anyway.

102
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:50,020

103
00:03:51,950 --> 00:03:54,450
Oh, God, I am so full.

104

I don't think I could put
another thing in my mouth.

105
00:03:56,960 --> 00:04:00,070
I'll bet just a
figure of speech.

106
00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:04,760
This is such a
beautiful restaurant.

107
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:06,930
They don't have anything
like this back home.

108
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,400
Really? They don't have
nice restaurants in Idaho?

109
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:10,770
Oh, well, yeah, I mean

110
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,850
we have a T.G.I. Fridays
and an Applebee's.

111
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:15,910
But you never see movie
stars like we did here.

112
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:18,780
Nina, they're just
regular people.

113
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:22,090
And technically, I wouldn't call
Geraldo Rivera a movie star.

114
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:25,560
Well, I thought
it was very exciting.

115
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:27,690
And since I'm only in town
for the weekend,

116
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:30,760
I think we should go
absolutely crazy tonight.

117
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:34,790
You two like to switch dates?

118
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:36,930
Ooh, I'm up for that.

119
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:37,970
No kidding?

120
00:04:38,030 --> 00:04:39,900
As long as we can
switch back.

121
00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:42,070
Alan, I believe it's time
we get the check.

122
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:43,740
Agreed.

123
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:44,930
Check, please.

124
00:04:45,010 --> 00:04:45,940
Be right back.

125
00:04:46,010 --> 00:04:47,180
Whoa, whoa, where are you going?

126
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:48,740
To the little boys' room.

127
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:51,850
He means the little cheap
bastards' room.

128
00:04:51,910 --> 00:04:53,040
What's that, Charlie?

129
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:53,980
Nothing.

130
00:04:54,050 --> 00:04:56,090
Excuse me.

131
00:04:56,150 --> 00:04:59,460
Back home we just call it
"the crapper."

132
00:05:22,210 --> 00:05:24,480
I thought you had
to pee.

133
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:26,490
I did. I do.

134
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:28,790
I am.

135
00:05:54,010 --> 00:05:55,780
Nice girls.

136
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:59,040
Yeah, they're terrific.
Mm.

137
00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:10,200
(sighing)

138
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:33,990
No matter how you shake
and dance,

139
00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:36,660
the last few drops
fall on your pants.

140
00:06:41,790 --> 00:06:44,830
Maybe you shouldn't
wear khakis.

141
00:07:03,810 --> 00:07:06,070
Uh-oh.

142
00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:11,020
What are you doing?

143
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:12,620
What do you think
I'm doing?

144
00:07:12,690 --> 00:07:16,730
Amazing.

145
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:19,090
This might take
a while, Charlie.

146
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:22,670
All right, let's play.

147
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:29,880
What, what
are you doing?

148
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:31,780
What do you think
I'm doing?

149
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,680
Okay.

150
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:35,570
Hey, Alan?

151
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:37,010
Yeah?

152
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:39,650
This might take a while.

153
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:44,910
MAN (on TV):
Where's Jennifer?

154
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:47,590
GIRL (on TV):
She went into the caretaker's
shack to look for Cory.

155
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:50,630
Okay, you stay here.
I'll go find her.

156
00:07:50,690 --> 00:07:52,450
No, I'm coming
with you.

157
00:07:52,530 --> 00:07:56,000
Will you people quit going
into the caretaker's shack?

158
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:00,810
Cory, are you
in here?

159
00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:03,740
No, you idiot,
Cory's been dead for an hour.

160
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:08,580

161
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:09,810
(cracking sound)

162
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:11,850
Man, should have went to bed.

163
00:08:26,230 --> 00:08:27,470
(screams)

164
00:08:27,530 --> 00:08:30,840
Are you crazy?

165
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:34,540
Well, there are several schools
of thought on that.

166
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:36,670
So, your dad let you stay
by yourself tonight, huh?

167
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:39,410
Why not? I'm old enough.
I don't need a baby-sitter.

168
00:08:39,470 --> 00:08:41,840
Okay. Well, then I'll leave you
to your movie.

169
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:45,520
Wait, wait.
You don't have to go.

170
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:47,650
Want a Pop Tart?

171
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:49,690
Sure, why not?

172
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:53,450
So, what do I need
to know?

173
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:55,950
Well, basically when
a guy has half a face,

174
00:08:56,020 --> 00:08:58,190
you leave him alone.

175
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:05,530
Charlie, you
still there?

176
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:09,040
I told you
it might take a while.

177
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:14,840
Well, I guess this train isn't
ready to leave the station.

178
00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:16,750
(toilets flush)

179
00:09:19,410 --> 00:09:22,540
You know what they say.

180
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:25,060
Better to be on the
toilet and not have to go

181
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:28,030
then to have to go and
not be on the toilet.

182
00:09:28,090 --> 00:09:29,690
Really? And
who says that?

183
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:34,270
I don't know.
It's folk wisdom.

184
00:09:57,450 --> 00:09:59,820
Uh, the liquid soap
is a nice idea

185
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:01,830
for the house,
don't you think?

186
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:04,130
I guess.

187
00:10:04,190 --> 00:10:05,690
I mean, it makes sense
when you think about it.

188
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,970
You know, you wash your hands
with a bar of soap,

189
00:10:08,030 --> 00:10:10,700
you're passing your germs
on to the next guy, but, uh...

190
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:14,900
with the liquid soap,
it's not an issue.

191
00:10:19,010 --> 00:10:22,050
Good idea.
Mmm.

192
00:10:22,110 --> 00:10:24,920
I'll tell Berta
to pick up some liquid soap.

193
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:28,190
Great, great.

194
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:37,860
How funny is Berta?

195
00:10:37,930 --> 00:10:39,360
She is a pistol.

196
00:11:09,890 --> 00:11:11,490
Don't want to get
athlete's hand.

197
00:11:38,090 --> 00:11:40,560
Another good idea
for the house!

198
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:46,160
Uh-oh.

199
00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:48,830
Don't even
think about it.

200
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:51,440
Where'd they go?

201
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:53,170
Your lady friends left
about 20 minutes ago.

202
00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:54,830
What? Why?

203
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:58,030
They said something about
life being too short.

204
00:11:58,110 --> 00:11:59,080
Are you happy?

205
00:12:00,510 --> 00:12:02,210
All right, just
give me the check.

206
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:03,750
Which you and I
will split.

207
00:12:03,810 --> 00:12:05,470
Not necessary.

208
00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:07,950
Mr. Rivera took care
of it before he left
with the ladies.

209
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:11,490
I guess they'll find out how
"at large" he really is.

210
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:14,230
Unbelievable.

211
00:12:14,290 --> 00:12:16,190
I know.

212
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:18,460
We got a free dinner.

213
00:12:18,530 --> 00:12:19,900
♪ Men.

214
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:28,460
(loud bumping on television)

215
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:31,640
(man screaming)

216
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:34,300
Boy, college students
are really stupid.

217
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:40,220
Yeah, if you shouldn't run
with scissors,

218
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:42,640
you definitely shouldn't run
with hedge clippers.

219
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:47,990
I can't believe I missed out
on a sure thing

220
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:49,260
'cause I was sittin' on the can

221
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:51,120
listening to you
not take a crap.

222
00:12:51,190 --> 00:12:52,320
You're actually blaming me

223
00:12:52,390 --> 00:12:53,790
because I had to go
to the bathroom?

224
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:55,160
You didn't have to go
to the bathroom.

225
00:12:55,230 --> 00:12:56,770
You were just trying
to stick me with the check.

226
00:12:56,830 --> 00:12:58,100
Oh, oh, I see,

227
00:12:58,170 --> 00:13:00,140
so you know my bowels
better than I do?

228
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:03,400
I will when I pull them out
through your nostrils.

229
00:13:05,710 --> 00:13:07,650
Well, I don't have
to listen to this.

230
00:13:07,710 --> 00:13:09,710
What's your hurry?
You see a check coming?

231
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:14,280
What do you think?

232
00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:15,750
Should we watch
the rest of the movie?

233
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:17,060
Might as well.

234
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:19,020
I'm not going to
sleep tonight anyway.

235
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:22,250
Leave me alone, Charlie.

236
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:25,150
No, no, no, no,
let's get this
out in the open.

237
00:13:25,230 --> 00:13:26,430
There's nothing
to get out in the open.

238
00:13:26,490 --> 00:13:28,190
I had to go to the bathroom,

239
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:29,720
and even though I don't have
as much money as you,

240
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:31,440
I was fully prepared
to split the check.

241
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:33,170
Not quite 50-50 'cause, you
know, you had the better wine

242
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:35,230
and your date had two
appetizers, but my fair share.

243
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:37,880
What are you doing?

244
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:39,240
What do you think?

245
00:13:39,310 --> 00:13:42,810
Alan, you can sit,
but you can't hide.

246
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:46,250
I am going to shower
and get ready for bed.

247
00:13:46,310 --> 00:13:47,840
(shuts door)
You're kidding.

248
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:49,340
You're just going
to walk away from me?

249
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:51,260
Well, Charlie,
when you're being irrational,

250
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:52,760
you leave me no choice.

251
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:55,090
I'm not being irrational.

252
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:56,160
(water running)

253
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:59,220
You want to see irrational?

254
00:13:59,290 --> 00:14:00,260
Here's irrational.

255
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:04,160
(screams)

256
00:14:12,370 --> 00:14:14,470
My lamp.

257
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:21,350
What the hell?

258
00:14:31,090 --> 00:14:33,220
I don't freakin' believe it.

259
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:52,320
(water continues running)

260
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:03,930
(doorbell rings)

261
00:15:03,990 --> 00:15:06,250
Charlie, the pizza's here!

262
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:13,270
So it is.

263
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:20,100
Hey, why don't I get this one?

264
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:22,770
Hey, why don't you?

265
00:15:25,450 --> 00:15:27,250
What?

266
00:15:27,310 --> 00:15:28,510
No wallet?

267
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:30,820
I'll be right back.

268
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,080
I'll wait.

269
00:15:42,230 --> 00:15:44,100
Here you go,
Mr. Harper. $22.75.

270
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:45,330
Thanks, Gordon.

271
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:47,340
Hang on.

272
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:58,350
Keep the change.

273
00:15:59,450 --> 00:16:01,320
Wow, thanks.

274
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:03,310
Oh, Gordon, wait, w-wait.

275
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:04,350
You got to hear something.

276
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:05,390
Hear what?

277
00:16:05,450 --> 00:16:06,480
Shh.

278
00:16:08,190 --> 00:16:11,360
Wait for it.

279
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:14,120
(Alan shrieking)

280
00:16:14,190 --> 00:16:15,820
Was that it?

281
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:18,140
Yep.

282
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:19,140
Thanks for waiting.

283
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:36,240
Looking for something?

284
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:38,960
Yeah, my... wallet.

285
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:43,850
Here it is.

286
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:47,230
Oh, oh, thanks.

287
00:16:47,290 --> 00:16:48,990
Wow.

288
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:52,290
The legendary lost wallet
of Alan Harper.

289
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:54,630
(chuckling):
Funny.

290
00:16:55,670 --> 00:16:58,440
(imitates creaking)

291
00:17:04,510 --> 00:17:06,140
Oh, my.

292
00:17:06,210 --> 00:17:07,180
There's no money in here.

293
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:08,590
No?

294
00:17:08,650 --> 00:17:10,320
No.

295
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:12,180
How were you going to pay
for the pizza, Alan?

296
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:15,450
Uh, I-I have, um... uh...

297
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:16,450
I have, um...

298
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:17,950
What is it, Alan?

299
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:19,890
What do you have?

300
00:17:20,990 --> 00:17:22,260
Nothing.

301
00:17:22,330 --> 00:17:24,000
You sure?

302
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:25,430
Oh, where did you
find that?

303
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:27,410
I mean, what is that?

304
00:17:27,470 --> 00:17:30,610
About $5,000
in small bills.

305
00:17:30,670 --> 00:17:33,200
W-Wow, wow, that much?

306
00:17:33,270 --> 00:17:36,200
A little less, since
I paid for the pizza.

307
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:38,080
And tipped
the guy a 50.

308
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:39,570
You gave him a $50 tip?

309
00:17:39,650 --> 00:17:41,290
Yep.

310
00:17:41,350 --> 00:17:44,560
Now I'm going to go light
my cigar with a hundred.

311
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:45,560
Wait, wait, wait.

312
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:46,560
Wait, wait, w-wait!

313
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:47,990
I just remembered.

314
00:17:48,050 --> 00:17:49,350
I lost a big roll
of bills

315
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:51,620
that looked a lot
like that one.

316
00:17:51,690 --> 00:17:53,560
Really?

317
00:17:53,630 --> 00:17:55,470
It's yours?
I had no idea.

318
00:17:55,530 --> 00:17:57,200
An honest mistake.
Gimme.

319
00:17:58,470 --> 00:18:00,170
You can understand
my confusion.

320
00:18:00,230 --> 00:18:02,430
I mean, a guy has got this
kind of cash laying around,

321
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:05,400
you'd think he'd be
able to pay for his
own freakin' bagel dog.

322
00:18:05,470 --> 00:18:07,130
(sighs)
You don't understand.

323
00:18:07,210 --> 00:18:09,010
The money isn't for me.

324
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:10,480
Really?

325
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:11,470
Who's it for?

326
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:14,320
Old Alan.

327
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:15,640
Old Alan?

328
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:18,520
Yeah, you know,
the Alan of the future.

329
00:18:18,590 --> 00:18:20,260
You're kidding.

330
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:22,450
They're still going
to have Alans in the future?

331
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:24,690
No, see,
the thing is...

332
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:26,330
(sighs)
I've been going through

333
00:18:26,390 --> 00:18:28,720
kind of a rough
financial time since...

334
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:32,270
well... high school.

335
00:18:32,330 --> 00:18:33,500
Anyway, it occurred to me

336
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:35,340
that I could wind up
an old man

337
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:36,960
with no one
to take care of me.

338
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:39,280
I mean, who will Old Alan
be able to count on?

339
00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:41,450
Certainly not Jake,
'cause let's face it,

340
00:18:41,510 --> 00:18:43,350
his best hope
of a steady income is

341
00:18:43,410 --> 00:18:46,340
if missing the toilet
becomes a professional sport.

342
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:50,190
So, I decided that

343
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:52,320
whenever somebody
in the office paid in cash,

344
00:18:52,390 --> 00:18:56,030
I'd put it away
for... Old Alan.

345
00:18:56,090 --> 00:18:57,730
What about the IRS?

346
00:18:57,790 --> 00:19:00,320
What about 'em? They don't
care about Old Alan.

347
00:19:01,290 --> 00:19:02,290
Okay.

348
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:04,460
Let me get
this straight.

349
00:19:04,530 --> 00:19:06,990
You're squirreling away
money for Old Alan

350
00:19:07,070 --> 00:19:09,640
while Young Alan sponges off
of Dumb Charlie.

351
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:11,570
I-I-I wouldn't call you dumb.

352
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:12,740
Sweet Charlie, Loving Charlie.

353
00:19:12,810 --> 00:19:14,250
Can I have my money now?

354
00:19:14,310 --> 00:19:16,210
You have a serious problem,
my friend.

355
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:17,450
Yes, I do, no question.

356
00:19:17,510 --> 00:19:18,470
Now give me my money.

357
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:20,790
You need help.

358
00:19:20,850 --> 00:19:22,720
I know, but who can afford it?

359
00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:26,390
All right.

360
00:19:26,450 --> 00:19:28,650
You know what I want you to do
with this money?

361
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:32,220
Oh, come on, man.
I'm already constipated.

362
00:19:32,290 --> 00:19:34,490
You're gonna spend it.

363
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:36,190
Every penny.

364
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:39,290
But, but what about Old Alan?

365
00:19:39,370 --> 00:19:41,370
What will he do?

366
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:43,130
Well, I'm guessing Old Alan
will be living

367
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:47,100
on Old Charlie's hide-a-bed
until they bag him and tag him.

368
00:19:49,210 --> 00:19:52,580
Really?
You mean, no matter what,

369
00:19:52,650 --> 00:19:54,650
I can always count on you?

370
00:19:56,750 --> 00:19:57,820
Keep the money.

371
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:10,360
There you go.

372
00:20:10,430 --> 00:20:12,360
Enjoy your movie.

373
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:16,300
Oh, hi, Charlie.

374
00:20:16,370 --> 00:20:18,940
Hey, bro.

375
00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:20,580
I'll take a big box
of Milk Duds.

376
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:21,640
Sure.

377
00:20:21,710 --> 00:20:25,180
That's $25.

378
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:26,710
Anything for
your lady friend?

379
00:20:26,780 --> 00:20:27,990
Nah, that's okay.

380
00:20:28,050 --> 00:20:30,350
She doesn't eat.

381
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:32,960
Food.

382
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:34,260
Keep the change.

383
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:36,220
Oh, thanks, Charlie.

384
00:20:36,290 --> 00:20:38,400
I can always count on you.

385
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:41,430
Come on, baby.

386
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:42,560
Can you believe
I'm older than him?

387
00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:47,570
Boy, that's some hot chick.

388
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:50,300
Yeah.

389
00:20:53,570 --> 00:20:56,100
Don't eat the popcorn, Jake.

390
00:20:56,180 --> 00:20:57,920
Sorry, Dad.

391
00:21:00,410 --> 00:21:02,810
(shrieks)
