1
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:05,850
So you understand
the situation?

2
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:07,310
I think so.

3
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:09,140
Now that we're not
married anymore,

4
00:00:09,220 --> 00:00:10,690
you want to sell
my condo.

5
00:00:10,750 --> 00:00:12,280
No, no, it's, it's our condo.

6
00:00:12,350 --> 00:00:13,820
I got it for us.

7
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:15,330
Not the smartest thing
I ever did,

8
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:19,300
but my real estate adviser
was my penis.

9
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:20,870
Is that what they mean

10
00:00:20,930 --> 00:00:23,340
when they say
the market's gone soft?

11
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:26,240
I don't think so.

12
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:27,770
Look, my point is

13
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:29,170
I can't afford
to carry the mortgage

14
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:30,780
on this place,
but if we sell it,

15
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:32,310
then we can split the profit.

16
00:00:32,370 --> 00:00:34,070
Or I could
buy you out.

17
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:35,470
Do you have money?

18
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:37,870
I will after we sell.

19
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:39,850
I am at the end of my rope.

20
00:00:39,910 --> 00:00:41,780
If can't get out
from under these bills,

21
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:44,160
I may well have
to declare bankruptcy.

22
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:45,960
Wow,

23
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:47,260
that sounds
really serious.

24
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:49,320
It is deadly serious.

25
00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:53,430
Well, in that case...

26
00:00:53,490 --> 00:00:55,790
Want to have sex?

27
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:56,930
What?

28
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,240
I'm horny, you're stressed,

29
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:00,940
seems like we both benefit.

30
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,200
Well, I am really stressed.

31
00:01:04,270 --> 00:01:05,430
No, that's not going
to solve anything!

32
00:01:05,510 --> 00:01:06,910
Okay.

33
00:01:06,970 --> 00:01:08,870
Well, I'm gonna go
take a shower.

34
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:10,310
Let me know
if you change your mind.

35
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:11,520
I changed my mind.

36
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:16,150
(snorts)

37
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:19,420
(groans)

38
00:01:19,490 --> 00:01:22,230
I either drank too much...

39
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:25,000
or got hit by a train.

40
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,400
Oh, God... train.

41
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:31,990
Charlie.

42
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:36,110
Oh, look,

43
00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:39,480
it's my sweet angel
come to take me to heaven.

44
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:42,250
Don't touch me.

45
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:44,380
I hope you're proud
of yourself.

46
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:47,810
Well, I didn't wake up
in my own vomit,

47
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:49,280
so, yeah, kinda.

48
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:53,280
You are such
a child.

49
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:54,450
Many people find that

50
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:56,520
to be an endearing
quality.

51
00:01:56,590 --> 00:01:58,860
I'm not one of them.

52
00:01:58,930 --> 00:02:02,570
It would appear not.

53
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:04,570
We had fun last night,
though, right?

54
00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:06,130
Oh, terrific.

55
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:08,540
What woman doesn't enjoy
pleasing a man

56
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:12,830
who falls asleep while he's
in the middle of reciprocating?

57
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:16,080
That explains why I dreamt
I was kissing Abe Lincoln.

58
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:35,320
Okay, some underwear,
no need to panic.

59
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:38,470
And a little bit of makeup,
no biggie.

60
00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:42,030
Running shoes, reading glasses,
flannel nightgown

61
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:45,100
and the latest issue
of Modern Bride magazine.

62
00:02:45,170 --> 00:02:46,900
Red alert.

63
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:50,220
Lydia?
What?

64
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:55,880
I couldn't help but notice
that you put some of your stuff

65
00:02:55,950 --> 00:02:57,260
in one of my drawers.

66
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:59,920
Yeah. Hey, you want
to come in here

67
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:01,160
and make up
for last night?

68
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:03,890
Well, yeah, but I think
we should talk

69
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:04,630
about this drawer thing.

70
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:06,320
Okay,

71
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:09,090

Nothing in particular.

Hard to believe
that takes practice.

92
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:24,700
Berta, I'd like
some scrambled egg whites,

93
00:04:24,770 --> 00:04:27,300
dry wheat toast
and Earl Grey tea.

94
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:29,300
Oh, yeah? well, I'd
like some new shoes

a jet pack
and a waistline.

You really thought
she was going

97
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:40,260
to make you breakfast?

98
00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:48,190
Yo, bro.

99
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:50,060
Hey.

100
00:04:50,130 --> 00:04:51,090
How'd it go with Kandi?

101
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:54,100
(chuckling):
Great, just great.

102
00:04:54,170 --> 00:04:57,080
Turns out we can be friends
with benefits.

103
00:04:57,140 --> 00:04:59,980
Ooh, nice. Did she agree
to sell the condo?

104
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,180
What?

105
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,700
Isn't that why

106
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:04,180
you went over there
in the first place?

107
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:07,340
Oh, yeah.

108
00:05:07,410 --> 00:05:10,950

109
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:12,290
Charlie,

110
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:14,120
you need to talk
to your maid.

111
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:15,930
Shh-shh-shh-shh!
Keep your voice down.

112
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:17,860
Yeah, we don't use
the "M" word around here.

113
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,120
Why not?

114
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:20,220
Because it's
disrespectful.

115
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:21,390
And demeaning.

116
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:22,960
And wildly inaccurate.

117
00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:29,900
The point is, Berta's the one
who keeps this house running,

118
00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:32,110
and more important,
she's kinda like family.

119
00:05:32,170 --> 00:05:34,840
She's rude, offensive
and vulgar.

120
00:05:34,910 --> 00:05:37,920
Okay, exactly like family.

121
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:39,420
Fine.

122
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:41,950
See if she'll do that thing
with the ice cubes

123
00:05:42,010 --> 00:05:44,350
and the silk handkerchief
you like so much.

124
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:46,260
Come on, sweetie,
don't be like that.

125
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,960
Ice cubes
and a silk handkerchief?

126
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:51,650
You can also use
a Popsicle and a necktie.

127
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,960
But I do owe you
a silk handkerchief.

128
00:05:57,130 --> 00:05:59,290
And your Water Pik's
kinda iffy.

129
00:06:01,770 --> 00:06:03,110
And whatever you do,

130
00:06:03,170 --> 00:06:05,070

but we never finished talking
about selling the condo.

134
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:18,990
But I don't want
to sell the condo.

135
00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:20,680
I can see boats from here.

136
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:24,850
I understand, but I can't
afford the payments.

137
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:28,320
I like boats.

00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,170
you won't cooperate,

140
00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:33,330
to call my lawyer.

Okay, well, as I said,

if you won't be reasonable,
I'll just have to...

to..

The skank's
right, Charlie.

361
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:07,750
It's her or me.

362
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:13,220
Great.

363
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:15,350
That's just great.

364
00:16:15,410 --> 00:16:19,410
Did somebody say there
was a big bowl of food?

365

♪ Men.

366
00:16:23,690 --> 00:16:26,530
You got an offer on the condo?

367
00:16:26,590 --> 00:16:29,390
Oh. Oh, Mom, you're a lifesaver.

368
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:31,860
I don't care. I fully expect
to take a loss.

369
00:16:31,930 --> 00:16:34,330
At least I don't have
to pay you a commission.

370
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:37,330
Oh, come on, you're my mother.

371
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:39,630
Wait, wait, hang on, Mom,
I've got another call coming in.

372
00:16:39,710 --> 00:16:41,350
Hello.

373
00:16:41,410 --> 00:16:42,680
Oh, oh, Kandi, Kandi, hello.

374
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:44,540
Yeah, listen. Um,
about the condo.

375
00:16:44,610 --> 00:16:48,410
My mom just got a very
reasonable offer and...

376
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:51,350
I give up. What are you wearing?

377
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:52,290
Hang on.

378
00:16:52,350 --> 00:16:53,350
Mom, I gotta go.

379

(whispers):
Hey.

381
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:00,530
Is Berta here?

382
00:17:00,590 --> 00:17:01,720
I haven't seen her.

383
00:17:01,790 --> 00:17:03,420
Great.

384
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:05,500
I have to admit, Charlie,
I never thought you'd have

385
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:06,360
the cojones to fire Berta.

386
00:17:06,430 --> 00:17:07,560
Are you kidding?

387
00:17:07,630 --> 00:17:10,200
I've got huge cojones.

388
00:17:10,270 --> 00:17:11,910
Why do you think I'm
wearing these baggy shorts?

389
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:16,670
Wait. Wait, wait, wait.

390
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:18,310
Wait, you fired Berta?

391
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:20,620
Yes, Alan.

392
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:23,220
She didn't know her place
and she had to go.

393
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:24,780
But we can't live
without Berta.

394
00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:28,290
I'll be right there, sweetie.

395
00:17:28,350 --> 00:17:29,250
Hurry.

396
00:17:30,790 --> 00:17:32,600
You know what?

397
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:34,400
We need to work on our
communication skills.

398
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:36,560
You know, I always thought
that, but I didn't think

399
00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:38,770
you'd be open to...
No, no, no, you jackass.

400
00:17:40,470 --> 00:17:43,710
God, you play along like
a monkey with a mandolin.

401
00:17:43,770 --> 00:17:46,310
You mean you didn't fire Berta?

402
00:17:46,370 --> 00:17:48,240
That's it. Give me the mandolin.

403
00:17:48,310 --> 00:17:50,410
But you promised Berta
you'd get rid of Lydia.

404
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:52,880
Alan, do you know
what this is?

405
00:17:52,950 --> 00:17:55,650
No.
Then shut your stupid mouth.

406
00:17:55,710 --> 00:17:58,780
And don't tell
Berta she was here.

407
00:17:58,850 --> 00:18:01,380
Fine. Just give me a heads up
when you're lying.

408
00:18:01,450 --> 00:18:04,420
I'm always lying.

409
00:18:04,490 --> 00:18:06,650
I'll give you
a heads up when I'm not.

410
00:18:06,730 --> 00:18:08,200
Yeah, you're the smart one.

411
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:09,520
Know how I know?

412
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:12,300
The washing machine
called and told me.

413
00:18:19,410 --> 00:18:21,380
Ooh! High heels and Cool Whip.

414
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:27,320
(toilet flushing)

415
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:34,450
Oh, Charlie, how could you?

416
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:37,890
Berta, this is not
what it looks like.

417
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:39,630
Charlie, you lied to me.

418
00:18:39,690 --> 00:18:42,660
Lydia, this is not
what it looks like.

419
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:44,970
That's it. I'm outta here.

420
00:18:45,030 --> 00:18:46,360
Me, too.

421
00:18:46,430 --> 00:18:48,530
Berta. Lydia.
Oh, come on, wait!

422
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:49,600
This is not what
it looks like!

423
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:50,810
(doors slam)

424
00:18:50,870 --> 00:18:53,710
Say it a few
more times, Charlie.

425
00:18:53,770 --> 00:18:55,340
Maybe somebody will believe you.

426
00:19:00,410 --> 00:19:01,980
Berta. Berta,
Berta, Berta.

427
00:19:02,050 --> 00:19:03,720
Wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.
You can't quit.

428
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:05,610
Why not?
Because we're family.

429
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:07,310
We love each other.

430
00:19:07,390 --> 00:19:08,960
We forgive each other
our shortcomings.

431
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:10,320
Oh, bite me.

432
00:19:10,390 --> 00:19:12,260
Don't go, don't go.

433
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:14,460
I promise I'll break
it off with her.

434
00:19:14,530 --> 00:19:16,370
No, you won't. And you
want to know why?

435
00:19:16,430 --> 00:19:18,040
'Cause you are
addicted to this broad.

436
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:19,470
Oh, that's ridiculous.

437
00:19:19,530 --> 00:19:21,330
I can stop anytime I want.

438
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,430
No, you can't.
You're a nookie junkie,

439
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:25,330
and I just can't
trust you anymore.

440
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:27,330
No, no, no,
no, no, wait.

441
00:19:27,410 --> 00:19:29,310
Wait! Wait, wait,
wait, wait.

442
00:19:31,410 --> 00:19:32,840
You're right.

443
00:19:32,910 --> 00:19:34,680
I am addicted.

444
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:37,690
I've got a vagina on my back,
but I know I can get it off.

445
00:19:40,050 --> 00:19:42,350
I mean... you've got to help me.

446
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:43,650
I can't help you, pal.

447
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:45,390
You've got to help yourself.

448
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:46,700
Good-bye, Charlie.

449
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:47,860

You know what?

I don't need either one of you.

Well, tough.

This is the only way
