1
00:00:01,070 --> 00:00:03,640
Previously, on...

2
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:05,530
I'm asking you
to marry me.

3
00:00:05,610 --> 00:00:07,450
We might as well
just go to Vegas and elope.

4
00:00:07,510 --> 00:00:08,950
If we're gonna have a family,

5
00:00:09,010 --> 00:00:11,250
we'll need to turn the
second bedroom into a nursery.

6
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:13,010
But that's where
Jake stays.

7
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:14,410
Yeah, but once Alan moves out,

8
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:16,310
then Jake won't be
staying there anymore, right?

9
00:00:16,380 --> 00:00:17,810
Alan's moving out?

10
00:00:17,890 --> 00:00:19,830
Of course he is.

11
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:20,890
Isn't he?

12
00:00:20,950 --> 00:00:22,690
I said the wedding's off.

13
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:25,200
Can I borrow your wedding ring?
What for?

14
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:27,830
Well, I thought,
as long as we're in Vegas,

15
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:28,770
I'd marry Kandi.

16
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:29,940
(laughing)

17
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,470
MAN:
I now pronounce
you man and wife.

18
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:32,660
You may kiss
the bride.

19
00:00:32,730 --> 00:00:34,960
I don't freakin' believe it.

20
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:36,580
Cheer up, Charlie.

21
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:38,580
You're finally getting
what you always wanted—

22
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,110
I'm moving out of your house!

23
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:42,310
I don't freakin' believe it!

24
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:48,150
Do we have time to play
roulette before we go?

25
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:49,490
Oh, honey,
that is a sucker's game.

26
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:51,280
The odds are totally
stacked against y...

27
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:53,580
Ooh, Super
Slots O'Fun Jackpot.

28
00:00:56,220 --> 00:00:59,390
Sure, make the smart bet.

29
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:00,320
Here, honey.

30
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:02,020
Kiss it before I put it in.

31
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:04,940
And the honeymoon begins.

32
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,770
Slots O'Fun— you get it?

33
00:01:06,830 --> 00:01:09,500
It's Slots O'Fun.

34
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:11,870
I'm ready for a refill.

Is that good?

00:01:19,010 --> 00:01:21,940
(bells ringing)

38
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:23,220
I won.

39
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:24,310
(laughing)

40
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:26,930
I won a half a
million dollars!

00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:34,160
Alan, you're rich!

45
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:35,670
We're rich!

46
00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:37,770
We're married now—
what's mine is yours.

47
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:40,300
Really?

48
00:01:40,370 --> 00:01:42,640
And the honeymoon ends.

Do you know
where Charlie is?

53
00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:13,330
Who's Charlie?

54
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,630
(knocking at door)

55
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:19,880
Charlie?

56
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:20,700
You in here?

57
00:02:20,770 --> 00:02:23,870
(laughing):
Hey, Alan.

58
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:25,410
Long time, no see.

59
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:26,920
Say hello to my brother Alan.

60
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:27,980
Hi, Alan.

61
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:29,250
Hi, Alan.

62
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:30,120
Hi, Alan.

63
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:32,850
Um...

64
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:33,850
I'm interrupting.

65
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:36,690
Gee, do you think?

66
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,470
Listen, I really
need to talk to you.

67
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:41,930
Can you come downstairs?

68
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,070
Sure.

69
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:44,060
Give me...

70
00:02:45,170 --> 00:02:46,870
an hour and a half.

71
00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:47,930
An hour and a half?

72
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,470
I know it's a little rushed,

73
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:51,180
but we're on
a tight schedule here.

74
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,240
Tina's got homework,

75
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:53,710
Cindy's got to meet her fiancé,

76
00:02:53,770 --> 00:02:56,540
and Marie—
well, Marie's on the clock.

77
00:02:56,610 --> 00:02:59,880
You already had two women in bed

78
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:02,350
Better safe than sorry.

79
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:03,690
I see.

80
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:05,210
Well, I guess I'll just
wait downstairs.

81
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:06,590
Good call.

82
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:09,820
'Cause, you know,
five's a crowd.

83
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:11,850
(door closes)

84
00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:14,870
Okay, does everybody
remember their assignment?

85
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:15,800
Uh-huh.
Yep.

86
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:17,360
Think so.

87
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:19,560
Then let's do this thing.

88
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:33,580
Hour and a half
on the dot.

89
00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:36,190
Can I plan or what?

90
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:38,610
Hey, come on.

91
00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:41,860
Show a little class.

92
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:46,630
So, how's the newlywed?

93
00:03:46,690 --> 00:03:48,220
Still living the dream?

94
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:49,800
Well...
I got to tell you, buddy,

95
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:52,500
things haven't been the same
around here since you left.

96
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:53,640
That's nice, but...

97
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:56,000
Yeah, they've been way better.

98
00:03:56,070 --> 00:03:57,480
I mean, look around.

99
00:03:57,540 --> 00:03:58,810
I don't even know
these people.

100
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:04,420
Yeah, and I can have sex
in every room in the house now.

101
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,220
I had forgotten
how much fun you can have

102
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,650
on top of a washing machine.

103
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:10,490
You know— hibbe-dah, hibbe-dah,
hibbe-dah, hibbe-dah.

104
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:12,050
That does sound like fun, but...

105
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:14,060
And the best part of all is,
without Jake here,

106
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,450
Mom has no reason to visit.

107
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:18,620
Heck, I may not have to see
her again till we meet in hell.

108
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:19,860
I'm happy for you...

109
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:21,800
Come to think of it,
without Jake here,

110
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:23,730
there's no reason
for you to visit, either.

111
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,040
I'm your brother.

112
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:26,300
Yeah, so?

113
00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:27,740
I'm your brother—
I don't visit you.

114
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,570
Charlie, listen to me.

115
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:31,110
My wife threw me out.

116
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:33,300
Aw, dude...

117
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:34,300
that's awful.

118
00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:36,070
Yeah.

119
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:39,590
Well, thanks
for stopping by.

120
00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:41,690
Aren't you listening to me?

121
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:43,120
Kandi doesn't love me anymore.

122
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:44,550
My marriage is over.

123
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:45,890
My life is in ruins.

124
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:48,080
Whoa.

125
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,130
What?

126
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:52,670
Déjà vu.

127
00:04:52,730 --> 00:04:54,870
It's as if I've lived
through this before

128
00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:56,400
and didn't really enjoy it.

129
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:57,660
Charlie, I...

130
00:04:57,730 --> 00:04:59,800
But wait, there's
a difference.

131
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:01,370
This time,
you can get your own place

132
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:02,670
instead of sponging off me,

133
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:04,140
'cause you have money now,
right?

134
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,970
Uh, well...

135
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:08,080
Oh, you suck!

136
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:09,300
It wasn't my fault.

137
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:11,650
There were taxes and the condo

138
00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:14,680
and Kandi's new car
and Kandi's new clothes

139
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:16,050
and the shoes.

140
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,760
Oh, God, so many shoes.

141
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:19,660
How much do you have left?

142
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:25,660
Eleven dollars.

143
00:05:25,730 --> 00:05:28,130
Okay, okay, let's start
from the beginning.

144
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:30,070
Well, things were fine
until about a month ago.

145
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:31,430
No, no, no, no, no.

146
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:33,810
I'll go back upstairs,
you come knock on my door again

147
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:35,640
and say you want
to talk to me.

148
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:37,130
Only this time, I'll kill you!

149
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,510
Oh, come on.

150
00:05:39,570 --> 00:05:41,440
You're all I have left
in this world.

151
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:42,820
I need you, Charlie!

152
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:49,710
Anybody here know a Charlie?

154
00:05:55,990 --> 00:05:58,260
Ah, geez.

155
00:05:58,330 --> 00:06:01,030
I'm working for Caligula.

156
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:07,440
Hi, Berta.

157
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:08,630
Hey, Zippy.

158
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:10,770
What are you doing here?

159
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:13,080
My marriage is over.

160
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:14,200
Kandi kicked me out.

161
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:16,400
Damn, that's horrible.

162
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:17,620
Yeah.

163
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:20,690
Damn, damn, damn!

164
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:21,750
Tell me about it.

165
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:24,190
I had October in the pool.

166
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:29,390
Pool? What-what-what pool?

167
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:31,400
Me, your brother, your mom,
a couple of neighbors,

168
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:34,230
had a pool on how long
before she dumped your ass.

169
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:36,970
I was so close!

170
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:39,290
You were betting that
my marriage was going to fail?

171
00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:40,510
No.

172
00:06:40,570 --> 00:06:42,440
We were betting on when.

173
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:45,630
So Charlie took
you back, huh?

174
00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:49,180
Well, not with open arms
or an open heart

175
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:50,540
or even an open door.

176
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:53,580
After he pushed me out, I had
to climb in through the window.

177
00:06:53,650 --> 00:06:56,690
But yeah, I'm back.

178
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:58,550
Well, I'm glad.

179
00:06:58,620 --> 00:06:59,990
You're kidding.

180
00:07:00,050 --> 00:07:00,780
No.

181
00:07:00,850 --> 00:07:02,520
With you and
the kid around,

182
00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:05,360
I won't have to hose down
the washing machine so often.

183
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:07,070
(doorbell rings)

184
00:07:07,130 --> 00:07:08,630
I'll get that.

185
00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:16,710
I guess there's no trusting
this butter now.

186
00:07:18,610 --> 00:07:21,950
Or the loose bananas.

187
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:26,520
Hello, Alan.

188
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:28,290
Judith.

189
00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:29,720
Hey, Dad.

190
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:31,310
Hey, buddy.

191
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:38,990
So is somebody going to explain
to me what the heck is going on?

192
00:07:40,690 --> 00:07:42,320
I thought he should
hear it from you.

193
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,840
(sighs):
Okay.

194
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:46,140
Jake, listen,

195
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:48,570
I know you liked Kandi
very much,

196
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:52,380
but she and I have decided that
we really can't stay married.

197
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:53,950
Ah, man!

198
00:07:54,010 --> 00:07:55,780
That doesn't mean that you
can't be friends with her.

199
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:58,840
No. I had December.

200
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:04,860
Alan, I just want to say
I'm very sorry

201
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,660
things didn't work out
for you and Kandi.

202
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:07,980
Thanks.

203
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:11,720
You won the pool,
didn't you?

204
00:08:11,790 --> 00:08:13,960
Yeah.

205
00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:15,830
And just FYI,
I spoke to my lawyer,

206
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:17,600
and he said that
even if Kandi takes you

207
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:20,260
for everything you've got, you
still have to pay me alimony.

208
00:08:20,330 --> 00:08:21,260
Here's his bill.

209
00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:25,800
(scoffs)

210
00:08:25,870 --> 00:08:27,600
Six hundred dollars?

211
00:08:27,670 --> 00:08:30,170
He explained it very slowly.

212
00:08:39,850 --> 00:08:40,520
You didn't call.

213
00:08:40,590 --> 00:08:41,860
What?

214
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:43,950
When Dad moved out,
you said you and me

215
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:45,620
could still get
together and do stuff.

216
00:08:45,690 --> 00:08:47,360
But you never called.

217
00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:50,140
Ah, geez, Jake, I'm sorry.

218
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,840
I waited.

219
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:53,740
I'll make it up to you.

220
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:54,700
When?

221
00:08:54,770 --> 00:08:55,870
Later.

222
00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:02,750
I'm still here.

223
00:09:02,810 --> 00:09:04,370
What do you
want me to do, Jake?

224
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:05,510
I don't know.

225
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:07,920
You really let me down,
and it hurt my feelings.

226
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:09,980
I know. I feel awful.

227
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:12,310
Fifty bucks and
it goes away.

228
00:09:12,390 --> 00:09:14,930
Ten.
Done.

229
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:17,730
Love you, Uncle Charlie.

230
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:19,590

I don't know, Jake.

234
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:31,110
He's pretty depressed.

Yeah, well,
that's the price you pay

with your penis.

237

No, your mother.

Uncle Charlie,

243
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:47,490
this is not my first divorce.

244
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:49,250
Got it.

245
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:51,390
Tell you one thing, though—
I am never getting married.

246
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:54,030
That's a sweet dream
to have, Jake.

247
00:09:54,090 --> 00:09:55,620
But sooner
or later,

248
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:58,100
you're going to meet a girl
who's smart, beautiful,

249
00:09:58,170 --> 00:10:00,140
and has a real grudge
against your parents.

250
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,900
What are you going
to do then?

251
00:10:01,970 --> 00:10:03,380
Don't worry.
I have a plan.

252
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,410
Really?

253
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:06,330
Yeah. If a girl falls
in love with me,

254
00:10:06,410 --> 00:10:09,310
I'll tell her I can't marry her
until I have enough money,

255
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:10,750
even though
I'll be secretly rich.

256
00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:13,510
How do you plan
to get secretly rich?

257
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:17,410
I'm going to marry a movie star.

258
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:19,010
You're going
to marry a movie star

259
00:10:19,090 --> 00:10:20,430
to avoid getting married?

260
00:10:20,490 --> 00:10:24,460
Guess I haven't worked out
all the bugs.

261
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:26,860
Well, keep me posted.

262
00:10:32,530 --> 00:10:33,600
Hey.

263
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:36,040
Hey.

264
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:39,070
Jake sure changed
in the last few months.

265
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:41,580
Starting to see a
real little man there.

266
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:42,740
Mm-hmm.

267
00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:45,550
Not a real bright little man.

268
00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:48,520
What you doing?

269
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:49,740
Making plans.

270
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:52,220
Do they involve
marrying a movie star?

271
00:10:52,290 --> 00:10:53,360
What?

272
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:55,250
Nothing, nothing.
What's your plan?

273
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:58,150
Well, I figured
I'd have a nice big lunch,

274
00:10:58,230 --> 00:11:01,200
get real drunk,
stroll down to the beach,

275
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:04,190
and try to swim to Japan.

276
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:05,560
Huh.

277
00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:06,790
Why the lunch?

278
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:08,470
I want to cramp up and drown

279
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:10,580
before the sharks rip me
to shreds.

280
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:13,650
Well, keep me posted.

281
00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:16,110
I'm a failure, Charlie.

282
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:19,520
Everything I've tried to do
in my life has ended

283
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:22,690
in complete abject failure.

284
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:25,620
Oh, buddy, you're looking
at this the wrong way.

285
00:11:25,690 --> 00:11:26,690
See?

286
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:28,980
I've failed again.

287
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:31,200
Will you shut up
and listen to me?

288
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:33,470
Failure is nothing
to be ashamed of.

289
00:11:33,530 --> 00:11:36,370
It's a part of life,
it's how we learn.

290
00:11:36,430 --> 00:11:37,340
Well, you know what?

291
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:40,210
I've failed
for almost 40 years.

292
00:11:40,270 --> 00:11:42,510
And what have I learned?

293
00:11:45,210 --> 00:11:48,450
Oh, that wasn't a
rhetorical question?

294
00:11:48,510 --> 00:11:49,580
Come on, Alan.

295
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:52,340
You got to have a sense
of humor about this.

A broke-ass,
middle-aged guy

297
00:11:54,350 --> 00:11:56,290
marries a 22-year-old
knucklehead

298
00:11:56,350 --> 00:11:59,360
just before he wins a
half a million dollars.

299
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:01,790
And then she takes him
for everything he's got.

300
00:12:01,850 --> 00:12:03,090

301
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:04,700

00:12:07,330 --> 00:12:09,400
Okay, maybe you're
too close to it now,

304
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:10,890
but trust me,
it's funny.

That's better.

367
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:03,430
You still depressed?

368
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:05,230
Oh, no, no, I'm fine.

369
00:15:05,310 --> 00:15:07,350
Just taking a little nap.

370
00:15:07,410 --> 00:15:09,810
You've been napping
for two days.

371
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:11,350
I'm getting old, Jake.

372
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:14,280
Old people nap a lot.

373
00:15:14,350 --> 00:15:17,590
It's kind of a dry run
for death.

374
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:18,850
Okay.

375
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:20,590
Well, see you.

376
00:15:20,650 --> 00:15:22,180
See you.

377
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:23,460
Hey, Dad?

378
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:24,490
Yeah?

379
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:26,230
Even though
Mom stopped loving you

380
00:15:26,290 --> 00:15:27,460
and Kandi stopped loving you,

381
00:15:27,530 --> 00:15:29,300
you don't have to worry
about me.

382
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:31,290
Thanks, pal.

383
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:33,660
You're my dad.
I pretty much got to love you.

384
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:38,900
So?

385
00:15:38,970 --> 00:15:42,770
Is he still curled up
like a cocktail shrimp?

386
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:44,370
Yep.

387
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:47,280
This is a real fun weekend.

388
00:15:47,350 --> 00:15:50,660
Wait in the car, Jake,
and I'll be right there.

389
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:53,460
Okay. I am running out
of patience with this guy.

390
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:55,320
I've had relationships end,

391
00:15:55,390 --> 00:15:57,630
and I don't go crawling
into bed over it.

392
00:15:57,690 --> 00:15:58,750
(clears throat)

393
00:15:58,830 --> 00:16:00,830
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
You know what I mean.

394
00:16:00,890 --> 00:16:02,820
It may not be just
the relationship.

395
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:04,370
What are you talking about?

396
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:06,290
Charlie, I've studied
psychology for eight years

397
00:16:06,370 --> 00:16:08,510
and been a
patient for 20.

398
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:12,200
Your brother is exhibiting
all the classic signs

399
00:16:12,270 --> 00:16:13,870
of clinical depression.

400
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:17,170
What are you saying? You think
he might try to hurt himself?

401
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:20,880
The important question is,
do we stop him?

402
00:16:20,950 --> 00:16:23,820
Oh, like I'm the only one
here thinking that.

403
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:29,230
All right, I didn't
want to have to do this,

404
00:16:29,290 --> 00:16:31,060
but desperate times call
for desperate measures.

405
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:34,120
What are you going to do?
Something I hoped
I'd never have to.

406
00:16:34,190 --> 00:16:35,120
You don't mean...?

407
00:16:35,190 --> 00:16:36,990
I'm afraid so.

408
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:38,730
Hello?

409
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:41,040
Mom?

410
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:43,830
(knock at door)

411
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:48,100
Oh, God, what plague
have you set upon me now?

412
00:16:48,170 --> 00:16:51,240
Alan, it's Mommy.

413
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:56,020
Good one.

414
00:16:56,080 --> 00:17:00,280
Oh, my poor
darling.

415
00:17:00,350 --> 00:17:02,950
How are you holding up?

416
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:04,820
How do you think?

417
00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:06,320
I blew another marriage.

418
00:17:06,390 --> 00:17:08,390
I wasted all my money.

419
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:10,630
I'm a complete
and utter failure.

420
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:12,300
Oh, sweetie,
you just can't see

421
00:17:12,370 --> 00:17:14,310
the big picture,
can you?

422
00:17:14,370 --> 00:17:15,570
What big picture?

423
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:17,440
Every foolish choice
you've made,

424
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:20,470
every wasted opportunity,

425
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:24,140
every hapless misstep in your
sad, misbegotten life...

426
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:25,670
I know, I know...

427
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:28,750
It's an opportunity
to learn and grow.

428
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:31,820
Well, perhaps,
but more importantly,

429
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:34,020
it's a reflection on me.

430
00:17:34,090 --> 00:17:36,890
Always good to see you, Mom.

431
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:40,430
I'm not finished.
Of course not.

432
00:17:40,490 --> 00:17:43,460
There is a silver lining
in this dark cloud.

433
00:17:43,530 --> 00:17:45,390
I can't wait to
hear about it.

434
00:17:45,470 --> 00:17:47,470
(clears throat)

435
00:17:47,530 --> 00:17:50,930
You're all alone,
you're penniless,

436
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,270
and you have no prospects.

437
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:56,470
Are we at the silver lining
part yet?

438
00:17:56,540 --> 00:18:00,410
Yes. Short of contracting
a flesh-eating disease,

439
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:03,680
things couldn't possibly
get any worse.

440
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:06,610
You've hit rock bottom.

441
00:18:06,690 --> 00:18:09,560
You have nowhere to go but up.

442
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:12,490
You know what?

443
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:14,100
You're right.

444
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:17,160
You're self-obsessed,
insensitive and soul-sucking,

445
00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:18,670
but you're right.

446
00:18:21,170 --> 00:18:23,310
I have stared into the abyss,

447
00:18:23,370 --> 00:18:25,530
and I'm still here.

448
00:18:25,610 --> 00:18:28,280
I-I've had my heart shattered,

449
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:30,440
and then...
and then shattered again,

450
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:32,340
and I'm still here.

451
00:18:32,410 --> 00:18:36,010
I've taken every piece of crap
that life could throw at me,

452
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:38,050
and I'm still here.

453
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:39,690
Well, we don't have to turn this

454
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:41,680
into an evening
with Liza Minnelli.

455
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:47,130
Now, get washed,
get dressed,

456
00:18:47,190 --> 00:18:48,690
get on with your life.

457
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:49,520
Okay.

458
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:52,440
And remember, no matter what,

459
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:54,570
I'll always love you.

460
00:18:54,630 --> 00:18:56,160
I know. Thanks.

461
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:58,080
Oh, don't thank me,
sweetheart.

462
00:18:58,140 --> 00:18:59,610
I'm your mother.

463
00:18:59,670 --> 00:19:02,700
I have to love you.

No problem.

Sorry I had to send Mom
in there.

470
00:19:19,930 --> 00:19:21,800
No, no, you, uh...
you did the right thing.

471
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:23,190
I needed a good slap
in the face.

472
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:24,660
Although, with Mom,

473
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:26,930
it's more like a nail
gun to the testicles.

00:19:30,070 --> 00:19:31,610
That was my thinking.

00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:34,470
Well, uh...
I'm really grateful.

476
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:37,000
Don't mention it.

00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:40,180
So, look at us, huh?

478
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:42,190

Yep.

481
00:19:46,290 --> 00:19:48,230
The Harper brothers,
together again.

482
00:19:48,290 --> 00:19:49,490

00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:51,330
Uh-huh.

will come and go,

Sure.

487
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:00,560
Forever.

488
00:20:02,030 --> 00:20:04,300
Well, you know, not...

489
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:05,670
not literally
till the end of time,

490
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:07,980
but, you know,
till one of us dies.

491
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:10,870
It'll probably be you,

492
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:13,880
'cause you don't take
very good care of yourself.

493
00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:16,090
Gotcha.

494
00:20:18,590 --> 00:20:21,090

Pow! Right on.

500
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:44,770
Tell you what.

501
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:47,210
I will grab us
a couple of brewskis

502
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:50,220
so that Team Harper
can kick back and chill.

503
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:51,080
Terrific.

Uh,

00:20:55,490 --> 00:20:56,990
but I'll get you a beer.
