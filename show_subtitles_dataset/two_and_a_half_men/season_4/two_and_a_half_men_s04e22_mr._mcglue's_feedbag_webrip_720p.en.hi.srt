1
00:00:01,430 --> 00:00:05,600
(car door closes, footsteps)

2
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:07,880
Charlie:
thank you for
transporting me home.

3
00:00:07,940 --> 00:00:09,880
You're a terrific cab driver

4
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:12,610
And i hope someday
to visit your country.

5
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:18,650
Damn, where
is that key?

6
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:21,690
Here, key-Key-Key-Key-
Key-Key-Key-Key.

7
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:23,420
Key-Key-Key-Key.

8
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:25,730
Aha!

9
00:00:25,790 --> 00:00:27,530
Hello, key.

10
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:33,460
(key rattling in lock)

11
00:00:33,530 --> 00:00:35,960
Oh, no...

12
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:37,530
Wrong house.

13
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:41,030
I'm lost!

14
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:44,410
Hello?

15
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:48,520
Hi, alan. Come on in.

16
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:51,450
Um, why don't you come in here?

17
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:53,920
I can't. I lost my key.

18
00:00:55,650 --> 00:00:57,450
Dah!

19
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:04,930
Had a few cocktails,
did we?

20
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,600
Me, too.

21
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:08,830
Listen, i need
to ask you a favor.

22
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:10,510
Your needs, your needs.

23
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:12,780
What about my needs?

24
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:15,510
Are you capable
of having a conversation?

25
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:17,540
Capable?

26
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:20,550
I just spent 20 minutes
discussing open-Toed shoes

27
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:22,680
With a fat man from rangoon.

28
00:01:24,110 --> 00:01:27,510
He's a rangooni.

29
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:29,390
We'll talk in the morning.

30
00:01:29,450 --> 00:01:31,380
I wouldn't
count on it.

31
00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:33,600
Go ahead.
You talk, i'll cook.

32
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:35,030
It's 11:30.
What are you cooking?

33
00:01:35,090 --> 00:01:36,590
Good question.

34
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:38,660
And i can give you
the answer in two words:

35
00:01:38,730 --> 00:01:41,770
My famous homemade chili.

36
00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:43,930
Since when do you make chili?

37
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,100
There's a lot you don't know
about me, alan.

38
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:51,640
I am man of many layers.

39
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:54,480
Strata, if you will.

40
00:01:54,550 --> 00:01:55,480
I see.

41
00:01:55,550 --> 00:01:57,550
A thin crust, magma

42
00:01:57,620 --> 00:01:59,960
And a chewy
nougat center.

43
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:03,490
Okay, uh, anyway, tomorrow
i have to go to the dmv

44
00:02:03,550 --> 00:02:04,720
To get my license renewed.

45
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:06,560
Ah, cars.

46
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:09,020
Where would we be
without cars?

47
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:10,560
And how do we get there?

48
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:15,760
Run, run, you're free!

49
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:19,460
Well, listen, the thing
is i can't take jake

50
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:21,040
Because he's got
a book report to do.

51
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:24,600
I love jake.

52
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:27,550
Well, that's good, but will you
help him with his report?

53
00:02:27,610 --> 00:02:29,610
I would like nothing better.

54
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:30,880
You want chili?

55
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:32,560
Uh, no, no, i'm good.

56
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:34,560
But just so we're clear,
you'll help jake?

57
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:36,860
I love jake.

58
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:39,590
Charlie, it's very
important that...

59
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:43,100
Relax, i'll take jake to
the dmv to get his license.

60
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,500
Book report.

61
00:02:48,070 --> 00:02:50,470
Beans.

62
00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:52,830
♪ Men, men, men, men,
manly men, men, men ♪

63
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:56,500

00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:05,040
Oh, no!

66
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,890
Charlie's blackout chili.

67
00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:11,650
It's delicious.

68
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:13,220
No argument there.

69
00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:14,890
Why is it called
"blackout chili"?

70
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,530
Well, sweetheart,

71
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:18,720
Sometimes when
people drink,

72
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,900
The do things they
wouldn't normally do.

73
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:24,160
Me, i like to walk into
a biker bar and take a swing

74
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:25,900
At the biggest chick there.

75
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:30,910
Your uncle charlie, on the
other hand, makes chili.

76
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:32,970
But what's the blackout part?

77
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,770
Ah, geez, jake,
how many times

78
00:03:35,850 --> 00:03:37,250
Have i told you not
to crap up my kitchen?

79
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:39,750
I'm not the one who...

80
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:42,690
Oh.

81
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:44,180
Still, it beats waking up

82
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:46,720
To find pool chalk
between your fanny cheeks.

83
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:51,100
Where's your father?

84
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:52,760
He went to the dmv.

85
00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:55,060
He said you promised to help me
with my book report.

86
00:03:55,130 --> 00:03:57,160
Really?
That doesn't sound like me.

87
00:03:57,230 --> 00:04:00,070
I didn't think so either,
but that's what he said.

88
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:02,080
When's it due?
Monday.

89
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:03,750
Okay. Today's saturday?

90
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:04,880
Yeah.

91
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:06,970
We got plenty of time.

92
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,610
Yeah, but my dad always says
if i do my work early,

93
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,640
Then i have the rest
of the weekend to have fun.

94
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:14,660
That makes no sense whatsoever.

95
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,520
That's what i said.

96
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:17,990
Let me ask you
something.

97
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:19,860
Do you want
to do it now?

98
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,990
No.
Then trust your instincts.

99
00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:24,720
Here's what you do.

100
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,570
You go out and have a good time,

101
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:28,960
Let the report percolate
in your subconscious.

102
00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:30,730
Then,

103
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:33,900
As the deadline approaches
and that flop-Sweat panic hits,

104
00:04:33,970 --> 00:04:35,800
Those pages will come
shooting out of you

105
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:38,570
Like a lunch from a supermodel.

106
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:41,140
Well, i do like to percolate.

107
00:04:41,210 --> 00:04:43,080
That a boy.

108
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:45,690
What are you
doing today?

109
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:47,560
Well, i've got to write
a new jingle

110
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:48,860
For a big credit card company

111
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:51,730
And they're expecting it
on monday, so...

112
00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:53,000
I'm going to the track.

113
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:54,900
♪ Men.

114
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:58,330
Woman (over p.A.):
now serving number 38
at window "d."

115
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:02,810
I got 42.

116
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:05,340
I made an appointment.

117
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:06,970
Good for you.

118
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:11,780
What's your number?

119
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:14,770
I'm 97.

120
00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:16,820
Ooh. Ouch.

121
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,580
You're gonna
be here forever.

122
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:21,350
Yeah.

123
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,950
Oh, hey,
you know what?

124
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:28,920
I'm probably not even going
to need this power bar.

125
00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:30,760
You want it?

126
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:31,800
Thanks.

127
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:33,330
You're very kind.

128
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:38,340
Next time,
plan ahead.

129
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,800
Will do.

130
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:41,770
Got to know how
to work the system.

131
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:42,780
Again...

132
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:44,340
Thanks.

133
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:48,010
Okay, i'm leaving.

134
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,350
Bye.

135
00:05:49,410 --> 00:05:50,310
If you need anything,
ask berta.

136
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:52,140
Okay.

137
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:54,620
She won't give it to you,
but she enjoys being asked.

138
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:04,260
Turn that off.

139
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:05,270
You're coming with me.

140
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:06,700
Really? To the track?

141
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:08,630
It's got to be better
for you than tv.

142
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:12,210
Are we gonna gamble?

143
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:14,140
No, suckers gamble.

144
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:16,000
We're gonna analyze
statistics

145
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:17,370
With proven
scientific principles

146
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:19,740
And make wagers based
on the result of data.

147
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:24,820
I think i'd rather watch tv.

148
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,910
Come on. Come on. Come on.

149
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:30,850
Woman (over p.A.):
now serving number 39
at window "a."

150
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:34,190
It appears my time on your
planet is almost over.

151
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:35,230
(laughs)

152
00:06:35,290 --> 00:06:37,120
(mocks laugh)

153
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:39,120
Excuse me. Are you
done with your paper?

154
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:41,070
Oh, sure. Here.

155
00:06:41,130 --> 00:06:43,030
Thank you.

156
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:46,060
I didn't even have
a chance to finish the jumble.

157
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:48,210
Well, i'll have time.
Ooh.

158
00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:50,870
Hey, 97, that ought
to lift your spirits.

159
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:52,700
I'm ebullient.

160
00:06:54,310 --> 00:06:56,010
I feel like such
an idiot.

161
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,950
I didn't even know you
could make an appointment.

162
00:06:58,020 --> 00:07:00,760
Well, most people don't.

163
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:02,160
Am i right?

164
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:05,790
Lena.

165
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:08,360
Oh, uh, i'm-I'm alan.

166
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:10,870
Ooh, you have a firm
handshake, alan.

167
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:12,800
I like that
in a man.

168
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:16,330
Well, i'm a, i'm a chiropractor
and my hands are my instruments.

169
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,870
And i also carry a little
squishy ball in my pocket

170
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:21,040
To head off carpal tunnel.

171
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:23,000
Ooh.

172
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:27,440
How much can i bet?

173
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:28,710
How much did you bring?

174
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:30,890
I have to use my own money?

175
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:33,890
Boy, you really are
your father's son, aren't you?

176
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:36,880
Okay.

177
00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:38,450
I have $14.

178
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:40,250
That's not gonna
get you very far.

179
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:44,890
Um, oh, and i have a $50 gift
certificate to pizza hut.

180
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,090
Want to buy it?

181
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:48,360
Sure. I'll give you 25 bucks.

182
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:49,900

To who?

184
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:52,040
To pizza hut.

185
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:54,100
Well, so let the good folks
at pizza hut

186
00:07:54,170 --> 00:07:55,370
Place a bet for you.

187
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,380
You're just trying
to rip me off.

188
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,970
Yeah. I've been
staying up nights

189
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:02,980
Trying to figure
out how

190
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:05,190
Now, listen and learn.

191
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:06,290
In any financial
transaction

192
00:08:06,350 --> 00:08:07,760
There is one question

193
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:09,090
Both parties have
to ask themselves.

194
00:08:09,150 --> 00:08:11,350
We're going to a party?

195
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:13,020
Will you shut up and listen?

196
00:08:13,090 --> 00:08:14,920
I thought we were going
to the track?

197
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:16,420
I swear to god,

198
00:08:16,490 --> 00:08:18,860
I'm going to throw
you out of this car.

199
00:08:18,930 --> 00:08:21,100
Now, as i was saying,

200
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:25,800
The question is what leverage
do i have in this transaction?

201
00:08:25,870 --> 00:08:27,010
The answer for you is "none."

202
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:30,210
What's leverage?

203
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:32,440
Oh, boy.

204
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:36,280
All right, a lever
is how you move things.

205
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:38,250
Leverage is how you move people.

206
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:40,120
Now, if we were going
to pizza hut

207
00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:42,920
And they didn't take real money
and i was starving to death,

208
00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:46,090
Your gift certificate
would give you leverage over me.

209
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:49,260
But alas, this
is not the case.

210
00:08:49,330 --> 00:08:52,570
Okay, i guess i'll take $40.

211

359
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:18,450
Huh.

360
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:23,520
It was like jury duty,

361
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:26,390
Without the fun of sending
someone to jail.

362
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:28,460
Sounds awful.

363
00:15:28,530 --> 00:15:29,700
Yeah, yeah.

364
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:32,570
So...

365
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:35,540
You guys ran errands today.

366
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:39,740
The little rat bastard
sold me out, didn't he?

367
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:43,300
Almost immediately.

368
00:15:43,370 --> 00:15:46,570
Why would you take
a 13-Year-Old boy
to the track?

369
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:48,410
Hey, i thought it
would be better

370
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,690
Than him hanging around
the house all day doing nothing.

371
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:52,450
He was supposed to be
doing his book report.

372
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:54,860
Oh, yeah.

373
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:56,620
And come to think of it,

374
00:15:56,690 --> 00:15:57,890
Weren't you supposed
to be working on

375
00:15:57,950 --> 00:15:59,520
Some big credit card jingle?

376
00:15:59,590 --> 00:16:01,460
I'm percolating.

377
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:03,920
Boy, you are
some role model.

378
00:16:03,990 --> 00:16:05,860
Well, one of us has to be.

379
00:16:05,930 --> 00:16:09,970
So, uh, exactly how much
did he win?

380
00:16:10,030 --> 00:16:11,530
$1,100.

381
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,670
Wow.

382
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:15,940
Forget it. He's not
going to loan you any.

383
00:16:16,010 --> 00:16:18,650
All right, all right,
we'll put it in the bank.

384
00:16:18,710 --> 00:16:20,620
It'll be a nice addition
to his college fund.

385
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:22,320
What college fund?

386
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:24,820
The one with $1,100 in it.

387
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:26,710
Come on, alan.

388
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:28,910
He won the money
fair and stupid.

389
00:16:28,990 --> 00:16:30,490
So you think i ought
to let him keep it?

390
00:16:30,550 --> 00:16:32,250
What's the worst
that could happen?

391
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,790
So he blows it.

392
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:36,860
It's a life lesson
and we get a donut machine.

393
00:16:36,930 --> 00:16:38,630
What?

394
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:40,940
It's just money, alan.

395
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,700
I don't want him
to think like that.

396
00:16:42,770 --> 00:16:45,040
Oh, much better he think
like you?

397
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:47,430
Squirreling away
every dime he makes

398
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:49,270
So he'll haven it handy
for alimony payments

399
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:50,610
And phone sex?

400
00:16:52,010 --> 00:16:54,550
For the last time,
i misdialed.

401
00:16:56,380 --> 00:17:00,320
Yeah, every wednesday night
for 20 minutes.

402
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:02,950
Okay, okay, we are not
talking about the phone bills.

403
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:05,630
We are talking about teaching
jake sound financial principles.

404
00:17:05,690 --> 00:17:07,600
And i am entitled
to a date night.

405
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:11,570
Fine. Take the money
away from him.

406
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:13,300
No, no, i'm not going
to be the bad guy.

407
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:14,530
I'm not going to be
the bad guy either.

408
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:15,840
Why not? It's your fault.

409
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:17,440
Hey, if you want to point
the finger,

410
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:18,930
Look for the horse trainer

411
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,500
Who put crystal meth
in mr. Mcglue's feed bag.

412
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:26,500
I'll bet that clydesdale
is still running.

413
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:28,320
Okay, okay, you think
you know best?

414
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:29,920
We'll let him keep the money.

415
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:32,620
But mark my words, no good can
come from a boy like jake

416
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:34,550
Having that kind of cash
to throw around.

417
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:37,020
Oh come on, the kid might
surprise you.

418
00:17:37,090 --> 00:17:40,330
Here's a hundred bucks.

419
00:17:40,390 --> 00:17:41,430
What's that for?

420
00:17:41,490 --> 00:17:42,820
I broke a lamp.

Oh, little lord fartleroy?

429
00:18:10,990 --> 00:18:13,390
Well, he wasn't pleased with
grilled cheese for lunch,

430
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:15,500

No.

You don't understand.

440
00:18:33,810 --> 00:18:36,840
Money gives him choices
and freedom.
Yeah, so?

441
00:18:36,910 --> 00:18:38,940
I don't have choices and
freedom, why should he?

442
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:40,090

443
00:18:40,150 --> 00:18:42,420
Come out and see
what i just bought.

444
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:46,880
Oh, i have another
bad feeling.

445
00:18:50,590 --> 00:18:53,760
Oh, jake, where
did you get that?

446
00:18:53,830 --> 00:18:56,630
A guy had it in the back of his
pickup truck at the gas station

447
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:57,940
And it had a "for sale" sign.

448
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,530
Oh, no.

449
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,400
I asked him how much it was
and he said,

450
00:19:01,470 --> 00:19:02,400
"how much you got?"

451
00:19:02,470 --> 00:19:03,870
And i told him $1,106,

452
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:05,640
And he said,
"it's your lucky day."

453
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:08,510
Can you
believe that?

454
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:10,650
That's two lucky days in a row.

455
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:16,590
Okay, i am sorry.

456
00:19:16,650 --> 00:19:18,450
You did not ride
that thing here?

457
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:19,680
Oh, no, i pushed it.

458
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:21,530
I figured i can
ride it on the beach.

459
00:19:21,590 --> 00:19:23,150
Well, you figured wrong—
it's too dangerous.

460
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:24,730
Don't worry, i got a helmet.

461
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:29,030
I traded him for a bag
of crab legs.

462
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:32,110
Can you help me take it
down to the beach now?

463
00:19:32,170 --> 00:19:33,780
No, you are not
riding that thing.

464
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,710
Yeah, well, i bought it
with my own money,

465
00:19:35,770 --> 00:19:37,570
So you can't tell me
what to do.

466
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:43,980
Really, i am as sorry
as i can possibly be.

467
00:19:44,050 --> 00:19:45,490
Let me just show you
how cool it is.

468
00:19:45,550 --> 00:19:46,990
Look, the guy told me
how to start it.

469
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:57,120
He said it might
need a tune-Up.

470
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:01,240
So where are
my crab legs?

471
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:04,040

472
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:08,740
Go ahead— say it.

473
00:20:08,810 --> 00:20:10,950
I'm stupid and i got
ripped off.

00:20:11,010 --> 00:20:12,650
No, nobody thinks that.

475
00:20:12,710 --> 00:20:14,920

481
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:27,630
I remember once when i
wasn't much older than you,

482
00:20:27,690 --> 00:20:29,720
I spend a hundred bucks
on a bag of oregano.

483
00:20:34,030 --> 00:20:35,530
Oregano?

484
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,100
Your uncle was making
spaghetti sauce.

485
00:20:37,170 --> 00:20:39,140
Yeah, in a parked car

486
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:42,530

pink floyd lasarium show.

487
00:20:42,610 --> 00:20:44,010
Thank you.

488
00:20:44,070 --> 00:20:45,900
The important think is
that you learned something

489
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:47,850
That will serve you
for the rest of your life.

490
00:20:47,910 --> 00:20:49,540
What's that?

491
00:20:49,610 --> 00:20:53,580
Always buy motorbikes and
oregano from authorized dealers.

492
00:20:53,650 --> 00:20:55,950
No, no, that
is not the lesson.

493
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:58,530
A fool and his money
are soon parted?
No.

494
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:00,130
Don't run with scissors?

495
00:21:00,190 --> 00:21:01,160
Do you mind?

496
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:02,220
Go ahead, i'm down to

497
00:21:02,290 --> 00:21:04,620
Don't eat the yellow snow.

498
00:21:04,690 --> 00:21:06,520
That's not it, is it?

499
00:21:08,030 --> 00:21:09,560
No, the lesson here

500
00:21:09,630 --> 00:21:11,700
Is that when a little extra
money comes our way,

501
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:14,140
We do the smart thing—
we put it in the bank

502
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:16,530
Where it makes reasonable
interest at minimal risk.

503
00:21:16,610 --> 00:21:18,580
And then we have it
for a rainy day.

504
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:19,640
Do you understand?

505
00:21:19,710 --> 00:21:20,580
Yeah.

506
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:21,840
Attaboy.

507
00:21:21,910 --> 00:21:23,710
Trust me, there is
no better feeling

508
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:25,540
Than knowing you have
a little nest egg

509
00:21:25,610 --> 00:21:28,310
To fall back on.

510
00:21:30,650 --> 00:21:33,550
There are at least
eight better feelings.

511
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:35,550
Charlie!
Coming.
