00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:03,570
"Help me out
here, Doc.

2
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:04,910
I need a time of death."

3
00:00:04,970 --> 00:00:06,670
"Sorry, Lieutenant,
but I can't give you

4
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:09,470
"an official T.O.D. until
I get her on the slab.

5
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:12,640
"But based on
hypostatic lividity

6
00:00:12,710 --> 00:00:16,550
"and degree of rigor,
I'd say our cheerleader

7
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:19,830
got her pom-poms pierced
right around halftime."

8
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:21,860
Real?
Real.

9
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:25,630
"Anything else?"

10
00:00:25,690 --> 00:00:28,490
"Left-handed assailant,
used a single-edged blade,

11
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:31,360
multiple entry wounds
and defensive trauma."

12
00:00:31,430 --> 00:00:33,430
"So how are we gonna
find this psychopath?"

13
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:35,100
"Well,
like our killer,

14
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:38,910
we'll just have to...
take a stab at it."

15
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:44,520
That's it.

16
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:48,480
(light applauding)

17
00:00:48,550 --> 00:00:50,890
So, you think I'll get the part?

18
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:55,120
Uh, well, I for one
totally buy you

19
00:00:55,190 --> 00:00:58,530
as a brilliant forensic
investigator.

20
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:02,390
Thanks, but I believe
it's pronounced "fornesic."

21
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:05,390
What do you think, Charlie?

22
00:01:05,470 --> 00:01:08,170
Unbelievable.

23
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:09,880
Aw...

24
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:13,110
I mean... beyond belief.

25
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:14,570
That's sweet.

26
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:17,510
I mean...
I just don't believe it.

27
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:18,820
You made your point, Charlie.

28
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:22,520
Do you like what I did
with the glasses?

29
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:24,480
On, smart...

30
00:01:24,550 --> 00:01:26,850
off, hot.

31
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:30,650
My mind is just
completely blown.

32
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:34,120
So when are you
gonna be on TV?

33
00:01:34,190 --> 00:01:36,090
I have to pass
the audition first.

34
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:39,030
Let's not put the cart
before the whores.

35
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:42,030
Horse.

36
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:43,770
(clears throat):
Maybe a little.

37
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:46,110
I've been rehearsing all day.

38
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:49,000
(makes exploding noise)

39
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:51,450
What's the name
of the show?

40
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:52,580
Stiffs.

41
00:01:52,650 --> 00:01:54,590
Stiffs?

42
00:01:54,650 --> 00:01:56,150
You know,
like dead bodies.

43
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:57,960
Oh, right. Sure.

44
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:00,130
I know what
you were thinking.

45
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:03,950
Well, I better go.

46
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:05,190
The audition's at 4:00

47
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:07,530
and I still have to get
my tan sprayed on.

48
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:08,730
Best of luck.

49
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,770
It has nothing to do
with luck, Alan.

50
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:12,190
You just have to stand still

51
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:14,240
and keep your eyes
and mouth closed.

52
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:16,230
No, I meant...

53
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:18,630
Never mind.

54
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:20,210
Knock 'em dead
at the audition.
Thanks.

55
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:22,170
And thanks for lending me
your chiropractor coat.

56
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:24,770
It makes me feel
like a real doctor.

57
00:02:24,850 --> 00:02:26,650
Now you know why Alan wears it.

58
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:30,480
Okay, well, uh,
tell me how it goes.

59
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:31,210
I will.

60
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,580
Oh, and by the way.

61
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:34,480
Did you get the divorce papers?

62
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:38,130
Not really, but my lawyer
explained them to me. Bye.

63
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:41,860
The-They need to be signed.

64
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:43,170
Kandi?

65
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:44,730
(engine starts)

66
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:48,640
(vehicle departs)

67
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:50,370
Hey, what's
your hurry?

68
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:53,050
If she becomes a big TV star
while you're still married,

69
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:54,780
she'll have to pay you alimony.

70
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:57,440
Yeah, and if pigs start
flying out of my rear end,

71
00:02:57,510 --> 00:03:00,540
we'll have free bacon
for the rest of our lives.

72
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:06,980
I don't know that
I'd eat that bacon.

Yeah?

86

(knocking)
What are you doing?

87
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:12,580
Hanging posters.

88
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,560
Did you consider
using scotch tape?

89
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:24,440
It doesn't hold as well.
Especially her.

90
00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:27,130
Who is that?

91
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,630
Raven.

92
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:31,470
She's the North American
ladies' wrestling champ.

93
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:33,550
Aha.

94
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:38,380
All oiled up and
ready to... wrestle.

95
00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:41,650
(knocking)

96
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:43,660
Damn it! This isn't funny!

97
00:04:46,690 --> 00:04:48,690
Quick little bastards.

98
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:52,570
What happened to your
Harry Potter posters?

99
00:04:52,630 --> 00:04:54,500
I'm not a kid
anymore, Dad.

100
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,590
You don't have to be a kid
to like Harry Potter.

101
00:04:56,660 --> 00:04:58,330
You want it, take it.

102
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:01,740
Aw, Harry.
You crumpled Harry.

103
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:04,430
You remember when we got this?
No.

104
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:06,430
Oh, come on, we stood on line

105
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:07,680
outside that bookstore
at midnight

106
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:09,710
to get one of
the first copies?

107
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:12,180
You were dressed as Harry and
I was dressed as Dumbledore.

108
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:13,590
I don't remember, Dad.

109
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:15,120
Sure you do.

110
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:17,380
You made fun of that
other kid 'cause he had

111
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:19,480
a flying mop instead
of a broom, and, uh,

112
00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:21,780
he started crying and his father
punched me in the chest?

113
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:25,250
No.

114
00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:28,200
Yeah, well, you weren't
the one with the cracked rib.

115
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:30,860
Anyway, what, uh, what
prompted you to...

116
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:32,530
redecorate like this?

117
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:35,230
I don't know, I like
cars and wrestling.

118
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:37,200
And wet T-shirts, apparently.

119
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:41,170
Oh, there is a wet T-shirt
on that— I hadn't noticed.

120
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:45,640
(knocking)

121
00:05:45,710 --> 00:05:47,280
Ha!

122
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:57,230
Jake's redecorating.

123
00:05:57,290 --> 00:05:59,890
Yeah, I can see that.

124
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:03,190
Oh, Raven.

125
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:05,590
Those are fake,
by the way.

Charlie!

127
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:08,460
What? He has
a right to know.

128
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:10,610
I'm just glad the little
guy's got me to...

129
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:11,800
Wait a minute.

130
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:13,670
Are those nails in my wall?

131
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:16,170
Are you out
of your freakin' mind?

132
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,770
No.

133
00:06:17,850 --> 00:06:20,450
No? That's your answer? No?

134
00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:22,540
Yeah.

135
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:24,460

Charlie, come on.

136
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:27,330
For God's sake!

137
00:06:27,390 --> 00:06:28,590
These are railroad spikes!

138
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:30,700
I'll putty over it.

139
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:32,430
That's not plaster
board, that's stucco.

140
00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:33,920
You can't
just putty stucco.

141
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:35,360
I know, I'll fix it.

142
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:36,570
Let's just give
him some privacy.

143
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:37,790
Wait, wait, wait.

144
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,940
At least I can take one
hammer out of his hand.

Look at Daddy.
Look at Daddy.

148
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:51,740
Ah, that's my boy.

149
00:06:51,810 --> 00:06:52,780
Where's Daddy?

150
00:06:52,850 --> 00:06:53,890
Daddy's over here.

151
00:06:53,950 --> 00:06:55,590
Wasn't he adorable?

152
00:06:55,650 --> 00:06:57,690
Yeah.

153
00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:00,680
Hey, could you rewind
to Judith breast-feeding him?

154
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:05,690
That was
really adorable.

155
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:09,670
Especially the part

156
00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:11,730
where she does
the old switcheroo.

157
00:07:14,770 --> 00:07:16,570
(baby Jake babbling)

158
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:21,250
I miss that little boy.

159
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:24,820
Seems like only yesterday
I could hold him in one arm.

160
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:28,420
He didn't weigh more
than eight or nine pounds.

161
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:31,210
He craps more than that now.

162
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:37,730
Where did the time go?

163
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:39,550
His childhood is almost over

164
00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:42,670
and there's still so much stuff
I want to do with him.

165
00:07:42,730 --> 00:07:43,860
Like what?

166
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:45,730
You know,
father-son stuff.

167
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:48,710
Pretty soon, there'll be
no more playing catch

168
00:07:48,770 --> 00:07:50,310
or riding bikes.

169
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:51,930
Do you realize
I've never even taken him

170
00:07:52,010 --> 00:07:54,850
fishing or camping
or hunting?

171
00:07:54,910 --> 00:07:58,320
Do you know how to fish
or camp or hunt?

172
00:07:58,380 --> 00:08:00,790
That's not the point.

173
00:08:00,850 --> 00:08:04,460
I-I-I thought
we would learn together.

174
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:05,590
Oh, that sounds good.

175
00:08:05,650 --> 00:08:06,980
You and knucklehead
out in the woods

176
00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:09,680
taking turns shooting
each other in the ass.

177
00:08:15,330 --> 00:08:17,770
Okay, it's not so much
about hunting, per se.

178
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:20,660
"Per se."
There's an outdoorsy phrase.

179
00:08:20,730 --> 00:08:22,400
It's about bonding.

180
00:08:22,470 --> 00:08:23,940
Before you know it,

181
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,600
he'll have no interest in
spending time with me at all.

182
00:08:26,670 --> 00:08:29,340
Not unless you grow boobs
and straddle a Harley.

183
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:32,570
All right, look.

184
00:08:32,650 --> 00:08:34,350
It doesn't help
to whine about it.

185
00:08:34,410 --> 00:08:36,380
If you want
to get lost in the woods

186
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:39,390
with Jerky Gherkinheimer,
go do it.

187
00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:42,620
My life is just
one big joke to you, isn't it?

188
00:08:42,690 --> 00:08:45,530
Actually,
it's more of a limerick.

189
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:50,430
There once was a moron named Al,

190
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:52,870
who wanted to camp
with his pal...

191
00:08:55,370 --> 00:08:57,940
Any chance you can go
camping in Nantucket?

192
00:09:05,450 --> 00:09:06,820
So, Charlie,

193
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,680
where's the wife and kid?

194
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:11,990
They went camping to do
some father-son bonding.

195
00:09:14,650 --> 00:09:17,320
(thunder booms)

196
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:21,690
(all laughing)

197
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:26,340
(wind whistling)

198
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:28,370
(thunder rumbling)

199
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:33,710
ALAN:
And when they looked at
the door handle of the car,

200
00:09:33,770 --> 00:09:36,810
there was nothing there...

201
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:39,420
but a hook.

202
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:40,890
A hook?

203
00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:43,120
That makes no sense.

204
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:44,710
Oh, I left out a part.

205
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:46,950
Um, uh, okay,
the guy who escaped

206
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:48,650
from the insane asylum
had lost his hand

207
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,650
in some kind of
an industrial accident.

208
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:53,720
Anyway, they replaced it
with a sharp metal hook.

209
00:09:55,630 --> 00:09:57,740
And it was said hook
that was stuck

210
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:01,010
on the aforementioned
door handle.

211
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:06,440
(creepy voice):
Ooh...

212
00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:08,510
Dad, over the past
three birthdays

213
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:11,850
I've gotten $175 in
bookstore gift cards.

214
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:14,810
They're yours
if we can just go home.

215
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,710
No, no, we're having fun.

216
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:19,010

Oh, come on, Alan.

242
00:11:47,470 --> 00:11:50,270
We both know
I can't do that.

243
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:51,910
What do you want
me to say,

244
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:53,220
that it was a bad idea?

245
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:55,040
Okay, it was a bad idea.

246
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:57,990
And the only thing we bonded
over was our mutual discomfort

247
00:11:58,050 --> 00:12:00,950
with pooping into a coffee can.

248
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:03,250
It wasn't Chock Full O' Nuts,
was it?

249
00:12:07,090 --> 00:12:08,990
Sorry, sorry. Where's Jake?

250
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:13,100
He went back to his friends
in Hooterville.

251
00:12:14,530 --> 00:12:17,030
Well, I can't blame him.

252
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:20,540
It never rains
in Hooterville.

253
00:12:20,610 --> 00:12:23,450
Look, Alan, seriously,

254
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:25,070
I'm, I'm sorry
it didn't work out.

255
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:26,280
I know your heart
was in the right place.

256
00:12:26,350 --> 00:12:27,990
Thank you.

257
00:12:28,050 --> 00:12:31,090
Now, I finished the limerick.
You want to hear it?

258
00:12:33,390 --> 00:12:34,860
Too soon?

259
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,550
You don't get it.

260
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:38,850
You don't understand
what it's like

261
00:12:38,930 --> 00:12:40,500
to be a little boy's
best friend,

262
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:43,990
to be someone he looks up to,
and then one day you turn around

263
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:46,890
and the only person he looks up
to is covered with baby oil

264
00:12:46,970 --> 00:12:48,170
and nailed to the ceiling.

265
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:50,110
Count your blessings.

266
00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:51,900
There's all kinds of pictures
that could have been up there.

267
00:12:51,970 --> 00:12:53,170
Yeah, I guess.

268
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:55,070
It could have been
the Moscow Ballet.

269
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:58,510
I got it. Still,

270
00:12:58,580 --> 00:13:00,920
I can't help but feel
a little empty inside,

271
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:04,010
like, like a chapter
of my life is over.

272
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:07,120
So? You've still got plenty
to look forward to.

273
00:13:07,190 --> 00:13:10,900
You mean, besides work,
loneliness and death?

274
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:12,330
Absolutely.

275
00:13:12,390 --> 00:13:18,030
There's memory loss...

276
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:22,540
impotence, adult diapers.

277
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:26,680
I'm all you've got, pal.

278
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:32,420
That's true.

279
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:35,950
My wives are gone,
my son is grown,

280
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:39,060
but I'll always have you...

281
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:42,090
my brother.

282
00:13:45,530 --> 00:13:47,100
Forever.

283
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:54,370
Okay, now, I was just having
fun, but that was mean.

284
00:13:54,430 --> 00:13:55,530
♪ Men.

285
00:13:57,370 --> 00:13:59,070
Well, when will he be back?

286
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:02,680
All right,
tell him I called again.

287
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:03,570
Boy, some agent.

288
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:04,540
He never calls,

289
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:06,040
he never returns my calls.

290
00:14:06,110 --> 00:14:09,310
I'm almost sorry
I let him feel me up.

291
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:13,150
I guess that's showbiz.

292
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:15,550
That's what he said.

293
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:17,490
Uh, listen, Kandi...

294
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:19,960
I really thought they liked me
at that audition.

295
00:14:20,030 --> 00:14:22,100
They had me read three times,
and then all the jumping jacks.

296
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:23,190
Jumping jacks?

297
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:24,960
It's an action series, Alan.

298
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:26,960
They need to know that I'm fit.

299
00:14:27,030 --> 00:14:31,300
Ah. Uh, listen, Kandi,
there's something I wanted

300
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:32,670
to talk to you about.

301
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:34,210
If it's about
the divorce papers

302
00:14:34,270 --> 00:14:35,440
I haven't signed
them yet.

303
00:14:35,510 --> 00:14:37,520
No, no, that's not
why I'm here.

304
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:40,320
Um, sweetie, do you remember
why we split up?

305
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:41,410
The big reason or all
the little reasons?

306
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:43,280
The big one.

307
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:44,750
'Cause there were
a lot of little
reasons, Alan.

308
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:46,320
I know.

309
00:14:46,390 --> 00:14:47,460
Like the way your toenails
grow all crazy.

310
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:48,750
Right.

311
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:50,520
And your ear hair
and your nose hair.

312
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:52,090
Got it.

313
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:55,570
And that one long hair
on your back, yuck!

314
00:14:55,630 --> 00:14:56,770
Wait, forget
the little reasons.

315
00:14:56,830 --> 00:14:58,570
Just, just the big one.

316
00:14:58,630 --> 00:15:01,100
Yeah, you didn't want
to have a baby, and I did.

317
00:15:01,170 --> 00:15:05,710
Right. Well, what would you say
if I were to tell you that

318
00:15:05,770 --> 00:15:09,040
I've changed my mind about that?

319
00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:11,680
Really?

320
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:15,710
Yeah, I've just been thinking
that Jake is almost grown

321
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:19,180
and there's still a lot of daddy
left in me.

322
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:22,550
So you want to have a baby?

323
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:24,220
Yes, I do.

324
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:27,190
A fresh start,
a-a-a new chapter.

325
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:29,560
Wow, that's a big step.

326
00:15:29,630 --> 00:15:31,540
Yeah, I know.
I know it is.

327
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,210
So if you want
to think about it...

328
00:15:33,270 --> 00:15:34,770
No, that's okay.
Let's make a baby.

329
00:15:34,830 --> 00:15:36,400
Just like that?

330
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:38,480
Don't you want to talk
about it some more?

331
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:40,510
Alan, it's practically
all we talked about

332
00:15:40,570 --> 00:15:42,100
our entire marriage.

333
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:44,780
Baby, baby, toenails,
baby, ear hair, baby,

334
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:48,180
how clocks work, baby.

335
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:50,220
(chuckles)

336
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:52,280
So... so you really
want to do this?

337
00:15:52,350 --> 00:15:54,480
Do what?

338
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:59,530
You see, if you use tape,

339
00:15:59,590 --> 00:16:01,460
it's much easier
to rotate in new posters

340
00:16:01,530 --> 00:16:03,770
when these ones
stop working for you.

341
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:06,760
I don't think
that's gonna happen.

342
00:16:06,830 --> 00:16:09,460
Trust me. After a while,
these beautiful eyes

343
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:12,380
are gonna be filled
with judgment and condemnation.

344
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:14,210
What are you talking about?

345
00:16:14,270 --> 00:16:18,570
Okay, maybe that was just me.

346
00:16:18,650 --> 00:16:21,250
Anyway, you're lucky

347
00:16:21,310 --> 00:16:22,780
your dad lets you hang
posters like this.

348
00:16:22,850 --> 00:16:24,290
I guess.

349
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:25,580
Does your mother let you?

350
00:16:25,650 --> 00:16:26,780
No way.

351
00:16:26,850 --> 00:16:28,280
So what do you got
at her house,

352
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:29,760
a secret stash
of magazines?

353
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:33,760
Just one. Playboy 1998,
the Christmas issue.

354
00:16:33,830 --> 00:16:35,800
God bless Hugh Hefner, huh?

355
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:38,790
God bless Kimberly Macadoo
from Portland, Oregon

356
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:40,870
born March 4, 1979.

357
00:16:40,930 --> 00:16:42,760
Turn-ons:

judgmental people and war.

Gotta love a chick
who doesn't like war.

360

Tape me.

361
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:54,440
Hey, Uncle Charlie,
could you do me a favor?

362
00:16:54,510 --> 00:16:57,580
If it's the favor I'm thinking
of, not until you're 18

363
00:16:57,650 --> 00:16:59,580
and not in my house.

364
00:16:59,650 --> 00:17:00,580
What?

365
00:17:00,650 --> 00:17:01,420
Nothing, nothing.

366
00:17:01,490 --> 00:17:02,890
What do you need?

367
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:05,800
Could you get my dad
to lay off the father-son stuff?

368
00:17:05,860 --> 00:17:07,200
It's kinda lame.

369
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:09,320
Lame? You think it's lame

370
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:10,870
your father cares
so much about you

371
00:17:10,930 --> 00:17:13,360
he wants nothing more
than to be part of your life?

372
00:17:13,430 --> 00:17:15,800
Yeah.

373
00:17:15,870 --> 00:17:18,440
Look, you gotta understand

374
00:17:18,510 --> 00:17:19,680
what your father's going
through.

375
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:20,880
What do you mean?

376
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:24,870
Okay, here's the deal.

377
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:28,910
Your father has reached
a very difficult age.

378
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:30,780
It's confusing
and a little bit
scary for him.

379
00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:32,350
Scary how?

380
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:34,690
Well, first of all,
his body's changing.

381
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:36,580
Really?

382
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:39,930
Oh, yeah. Hair is growing
where it's never grown before.

383
00:17:39,990 --> 00:17:42,820
That is scary.

384
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:45,240
And then there's
the hormones.
Hormones?

385
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:48,810
Yep, your father
is running out of them.

386
00:17:48,870 --> 00:17:50,910
Sounds bad.

387
00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:53,840
No, no, it's just a
perfectly natural part

388

389

Is it happening to you?

390
00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:58,340
No, no, no.

391
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:03,380
My point is that your father
is going through this phase

392
00:18:03,450 --> 00:18:05,680
and you have to be patient
and understanding.

393
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:08,220
So he's gonna want
to go camping again?

394
00:18:08,290 --> 00:18:12,300
Probably not in this lifetime.

395
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:15,930
But you might have to play
catch with him or something.

396
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,670
Guess I could do that.

397
00:18:17,730 --> 00:18:19,560

398
00:18:19,630 --> 00:18:22,630

we had this little talk.
