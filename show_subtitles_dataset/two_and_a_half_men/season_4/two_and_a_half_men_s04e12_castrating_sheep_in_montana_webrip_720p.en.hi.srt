1
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:05,590
I had a great dream
last night.

2
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:07,070
Really?
Yeah.

3
00:00:07,130 --> 00:00:09,530
I dreamed I got locked
in a house made of donuts

4
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:11,930
and I had to eat my way out.

5
00:00:12,010 --> 00:00:13,880
Interesting.

6
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:18,010
I had a similar dream,
only no house and no donuts.

7
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:19,990
Morning.

8
00:00:20,050 --> 00:00:21,750
Morning.
Morning.

9
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:22,860
So, uh...

10
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:24,660
how'd everybody sleep?

11
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:28,820
Uncle Charlie and I
both had dreams about eating.

12
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:30,900
Mine was with donuts.
His was something dirty.

13
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:33,970
He's just guessing.

14
00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:35,900
Good guess.

15
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:39,090
And yes, Alan, we
see your earring.

16
00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:41,810
It's pretty cool, right?

17
00:00:41,870 --> 00:00:45,780
Yeah, if you're going to a Wham!
concert with Molly Ringwald.

18
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:49,670
I think it's cool.
Thank you, Jake.

19
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:51,440
Can I get my ear pierced?
No.

20
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:52,840
Why not?

21
00:00:52,910 --> 00:00:55,380
You can't keep
the holes you have clean.

22
00:00:55,450 --> 00:00:57,690
And you're too young.

23
00:00:57,750 --> 00:00:59,080
Wait till you're old, desperate,

24
00:00:59,150 --> 00:01:00,780
and living
in your brother's house.

25
00:01:00,850 --> 00:01:02,650
You can mock me all you want,

26
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:05,120
but there's a certain lady
who thinks it's darn sexy.

27
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:07,760
First of all, I don't need
permission to mock you...

28
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:09,430
but more importantly,

29
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:12,510
you let some broad talk you
into piercing your ear?

30
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:15,940
Actually, my ear wasn't
her first choice to pierce.

31
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,070
What else can you pierce?

32
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:23,140
Nothing.
Nothing.

33
00:01:23,210 --> 00:01:24,470
Fine. Don't tell me.

34
00:01:24,550 --> 00:01:25,520
I'll Google it.

35
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:27,950
Don't worry.

36
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:30,820
He can't
spell "pierce."

37
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,650
He can't spell "Google."

38
00:01:33,790 --> 00:01:37,000
So, who's Princess Poke-a-Hole?

39
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:39,970
Just a nice young woman with
a sewing needle and a potato.

40
00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:41,830
A potato?

41
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:43,670
Yeah, she, uh, she put it
behind my lobe,

42
00:01:43,730 --> 00:01:44,890
sort of like a pincushion.

43
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:47,510
Oh. So you're a moron.

44
00:01:47,570 --> 00:01:48,910
It's perfectly safe.

45
00:01:48,970 --> 00:01:49,980
She sterilized the needle.

46
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:51,140
How?

47
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,040
With alcohol.

48
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:57,140
Okay, Kahlua.

49
00:01:57,210 --> 00:02:01,910
Well, I guess I owe morons
an apology.

50
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:03,810
You do know that's the gay ear.

51
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,530
What?

52
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:13,660
Left ear says "I'm a hipster
from the disco era."

53
00:02:13,730 --> 00:02:14,870
Right ear says...

54
00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:17,000
(flamboyantly):
"Let's disco!"

55
00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:22,610
No, no,
th-th-that can't be right.

56
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:24,030
Okay, don't believe me.

57
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:28,040
Hey, look who's finally
out of the closet.

58
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:33,040
♪ Men, men, men, men,
manly men, men, men ♪

59
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:35,810
♪ Ah.
♪ Men.
♪ Men.

61
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:52,800
Berta.

62
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:54,570
Yeah.
What are you doing?

63
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,110
Making your bed.

64
00:02:56,170 --> 00:02:58,610
Well, I'd like
to take a nap.

65
00:02:58,670 --> 00:03:01,800
Hop in. You can spoon me,
but it ends there.

66
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:04,510
Are you sick?

67
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:06,820
Yeah, I'm sick.

68
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:09,650
I'm sick of staying up all night
with a screaming baby

69
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:11,620
while my daughter's out trolling
the waterfront

70
00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:13,890
for the father of her next one.

71
00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:16,020
Whoa, that's rough.

72
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:18,960
Oh, don't feign interest
in my life, Charlie.

73
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:21,800
Sorry, I, I, I see
a woman in my bed,

74
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:24,260
I instinctively
start lying.

75
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:27,130
Close the door on your way out.

76
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,160
Okay.

77
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:35,850
No.

78
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:38,220
No, this is ridiculous.

79
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,280
Berta.
Get out.

80
00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:41,920
Sleep tight.

81
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:45,750
(phone ringing)

82
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:47,190
Hello? Ow!

83
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:50,560
Uh, hello?

84
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:52,190
Oh, oh, hi.

85
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:54,700
Uh, no, no, it's, uh,
it's just a little tender.

86
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:56,690
I'm glad you called.
I, I missed you, too.

87
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:58,590
Yeah, yeah, last
night was fun.

88
00:03:58,670 --> 00:04:00,270
(laughs)

89
00:04:00,330 --> 00:04:02,000
You won't believe
who's in my bed.

90
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:04,040
Hang on.

91
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:06,130
I never do...

92
00:04:06,210 --> 00:04:08,580
but I'm on the
phone right now.

93
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:09,570
Ow!

94
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:11,810
Ah... damn it.

95
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:13,590
Uh, listen, how
about tonight?

96
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:14,750
Oh, great, great.

97
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:16,120
The usual place?

98
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:17,150
All right, well,
see you then.

99
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:19,120
(chuckles)
Okay. B-Bye.

100
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:22,190
Berta's in my bed.

101
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:24,730
Really?

102
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:26,860
Couldn't you just pay her
in cash this week?

103
00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:28,300
(chuckling)

104
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:30,270
Ow!

105
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:34,060
There are some things
we don't joke about.

106
00:04:35,170 --> 00:04:37,010
Okay, so...

107
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:39,300
why is Berta
in your bed?

108
00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:41,600
Apparently, her daughter's been
out partying every night

109
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,220
and Berta's been stuck
with the baby.

110
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,750
Oh, that's got to be rough.

111
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:49,180
Don't feign interest
in her life, Alan.

112
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:50,760
Sorry.

113
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:52,960
Oh, hey, hey, listen,
can you watch Jake tonight?

114
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:55,350
Why? You want to see if your
new lady friend can infect

115
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:57,150
other parts of your body?

116
00:04:57,220 --> 00:04:58,750
It's not infected.

117
00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:00,770
A certain amount of swelling
is perfectly normal.

118
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:01,830
Where'd it say that, Alan?

119
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:03,340
On the potato?

120
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:09,900
Are you at least going to
tell me who this woman is?

121
00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:12,200
It's nobody you know.

122
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:14,340
Oh... so I know her.

123
00:05:14,410 --> 00:05:16,680
I didn't say that.

124
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:18,110
You didn't have to.

125
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:19,790
Now let's see.

126
00:05:19,850 --> 00:05:22,050
Who do I know that you'd
like to keep a secret?

127
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,290
You're wasting your time.

128
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:24,150
One of your ex-wives?

129
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:25,290
(scoffs)

130
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:27,320
Rose? Berta's
daughter?

131
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:32,000
(laughing):
Berta's daughter?

132
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:33,830
D-Don't be ridiculous.

133
00:05:33,890 --> 00:05:35,260
Ha... ha-ha.

134
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:41,140
That's rich.

135
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,700
Ha, ha, ha!

136
00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:47,110
♪ Men...

137
00:05:47,170 --> 00:05:49,100
I'm tired.
Shouldn't I be in bed?

138
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:50,880
Shut up and deal.

139
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:53,740
Look, I'll give you back
the money I won.

140
00:05:53,810 --> 00:05:55,340
You didn't win it
till we stop playing.

141
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:56,350
Now deal.

142
00:05:58,390 --> 00:06:00,190
What's he doing up?

143
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:02,120
Not now, Alan.

144
00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:03,960
I'm all in.

145
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:05,820
Jake, bed.

146
00:06:05,890 --> 00:06:07,420
Hold on, Dad. Call ya.

147
00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:08,660
Pocket aces.

148
00:06:08,730 --> 00:06:10,340
What do you got?

149
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,970
You heard your father.
Go to bed.

150
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,400
He's been betting
on garbage all night.

151
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:19,270
You let a 12-year-old
beat you at poker?

152
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:21,110
He's 12 and a half.

153
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:25,310
What's going on
with your ear, Dumbo?

154
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:27,250
It's just a little swelling.

155
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:28,240
It's normal.

156
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:30,320
Better pierce the other one.

157
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:32,180
You don't want to be
flying around in circles.

158
00:06:33,290 --> 00:06:34,990
It's fine.

159
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:37,060
Listen, th-there's something
I need to get off my chest.

160
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,290
If you don't see
a doctor soon,

161
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:40,830
it'll be your earlobe.

162
00:06:40,890 --> 00:06:42,360
Are you going
to listen or what?
Sorry.

163
00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:45,270
I'm all ears.
No, wait, that's you.

164
00:06:45,330 --> 00:06:47,060
You know what? Forget about it.

165
00:06:47,130 --> 00:06:49,200
No, no, no, no,
come on. Talk to me.
(sighs)

166
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:50,940
It's about the girl I'm dating.

167
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,330
Berta's daughter.

168
00:06:52,410 --> 00:06:53,950
How didyou know?

169
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:58,020
Your idiot son doesn't
have a single tell,

170
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,050
but you I can read
like a stop sign.

171
00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:01,840
Okay.

172
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:04,320
I was going to build up
to the big reveal, but I...

173
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:05,910
Just cut to the chase.

174
00:07:07,290 --> 00:07:09,430
You remember how I had
a little crush on Naomi

175
00:07:09,490 --> 00:07:10,230
when she was pregnant?

176
00:07:10,290 --> 00:07:11,850
A little crush?

177
00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:14,800
You were like a monkey
trying to hump a watermelon.

178
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:16,420
Are you going
to let me tell the story?

179
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:18,100
I'm just fact-checking.

180
00:07:18,170 --> 00:07:19,500
Go ahead.

181
00:07:19,570 --> 00:07:23,280
Anyway, after she had the baby,
we stayed in touch,

182
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:26,040
and I got to know her
and the baby and...

183
00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:27,480
I'm starting to care
about both of them.

184
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:30,770
Aw, buddy, you got a heart
as big as your ear.

185
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,280
But you're falling into
the same trap you always do.

186
00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:36,450
What's that?

187
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:38,790
You're a pathological
rescuer.

188
00:07:38,850 --> 00:07:40,150
Ever since you're
a little kid,

189
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:42,350
bringing home that
stray three-legged cat.

190
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:44,890
Oh, yeah, Tippy.

191
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,830
And finding the
sick baby bird...

192
00:07:46,890 --> 00:07:48,060
Mm.
feeding it with
an eyedropper,

193
00:07:48,130 --> 00:07:49,230
nursing it back to health.

194
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:51,540
Until Tippy ate it.

195
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:54,210
And it's the same
thing with women.

196
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:57,810
You constantly seek out
these damaged, needy broads.

197
00:07:57,870 --> 00:07:59,900
You know, you're right.

198
00:07:59,970 --> 00:08:01,340
Maybe subconsciously
I'm hoping

199
00:08:01,410 --> 00:08:03,220
that if I save them,
they'll love me.

200
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,850
Perhaps.

201
00:08:04,910 --> 00:08:07,040
Or subconsciously you realize
the only way

202
00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:08,540
an emotionally healthy,
self-supporting woman

203
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:10,420
would pick you up is
on a scavenger hunt.

204
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:15,090
But... we digress.

205
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:18,060
Please continue with
your star-crossed love story.

206
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:19,970
Well, Naomi and I
have been sneaking around

207
00:08:20,030 --> 00:08:21,300
behind Berta's back

208
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,790
and... I'm starting
to feel guilty about it.

209
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:25,290
You want my advice?

210
00:08:25,370 --> 00:08:26,970
Live with the guilt
and see a doctor

211
00:08:27,030 --> 00:08:29,160
before that thing
grows teeth.

212
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:31,180
But don't you think
the honorable thing

213
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:32,240
would be to tell Berta?

214
00:08:32,310 --> 00:08:34,580
Sure, honorable's one way to go.

215
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:37,240
But may I remind you that
this is a woman who's been known

216
00:08:37,310 --> 00:08:39,210
to lift the stove with one hand

217
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:42,250
in order to beat a mouse
to death with the other.

218
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:47,120
How much honor you think
that little fella had?

219
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:49,190
Oh... now you're
just being silly.

220
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:51,360
I mean, Berta's not going
to physically assault me.

221
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:53,390
I hope you're right.

222
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:57,260
I've grown to enjoy
these little talks.

223
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:02,500
♪ Men...

224
00:09:02,570 --> 00:09:05,180
Why don't you just pay me
what you owe me?

225
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:07,310
I don't owe you till we're done.

226
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:10,280
Now throw the dice.

227
00:09:13,310 --> 00:09:15,410
Oh, you just suck.

228
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:20,260
I wouldn't need a job
if I joined the Army.

229
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,280
You can't join
the Army.
Why not?

230
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:25,530
Because you already are
all that you can be.

231
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:27,860
You remember
my little burden Naomi.

232
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:31,270
Oh, sure, I remember her.
Hi.

233
00:09:31,330 --> 00:09:33,600
She's got job
interviews
this afternoon.

234
00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:35,370
I'm gonna watch the baby.

235
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,180
How are you going to work
and watch the baby?

236
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:39,080
Who said I was gonna work?

237
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:41,970
CHARLIE:
Hey, Alan.

238
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:43,470
Look who's here.

239
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:47,450
Oh. H-Hello.
Hi.

240
00:09:47,510 --> 00:09:49,410
Um... Nancy, right?

241
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:51,980
Uh, Naomi.
Naomi. Naomi, sure.

242
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:53,250
(chuckling):
Been a long time.

243
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:54,480
Sure has.

244
00:09:54,550 --> 00:09:56,220
And this must be
your baby.

245
00:09:56,290 --> 00:09:57,600
Oh, isn't she cute?

246
00:09:57,660 --> 00:09:59,000
Oh, thanks.

247
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:00,500
And there's
the proud grandma.

248
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:03,530
Look at her beaming.

249
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:07,010
Well, dip me in butter
and roll me in nuts.

250
00:10:08,370 --> 00:10:10,610
I, too, am shocked.

251
00:10:12,210 --> 00:10:13,410
So you're the
sleazeball

252
00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:15,200
she's been running
around with.

253
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:17,580
Oh, Alan, how could you?

254
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:19,310
I-It's my fault, Mom.

255
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:20,620
Alan wanted to tell you.

256
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:22,480
No, no, it's,
it's my responsibility.

257
00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:25,290
If you're gonna do anything,
do it to me.

258
00:10:31,490 --> 00:10:33,290
Welcome to the family.

259
00:10:45,710 --> 00:10:47,150
I made you breakfast.

260
00:10:47,210 --> 00:10:48,680
Really?

261
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:51,070
Need to have your morning
tinkle first?

262
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:54,350
No, I'm okay.

263
00:10:54,410 --> 00:10:55,510
Good.

264
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:57,080
I made all
your favorites:

265
00:10:57,150 --> 00:10:59,680
scrambled egg whites,
turkey bacon,

266
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:02,380
rye toast no butter,
decaf coffee.

267
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:04,100
Well, thank you.

268
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,430
You eat like a 90-year-old
man with stomach cancer,

269
00:11:06,490 --> 00:11:08,520
but I don't judge.

270
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,570
So...

271
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:13,230
what do you and my little girl
have planned for today?

272
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:15,560
Maybe a romantic
walk on the beach?

273
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:17,110
A cozy picnic?

274
00:11:17,170 --> 00:11:18,470
I could pack you a lunch.

275
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:20,080
Uh, gee, Berta, I don't...

276
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:21,040
Or how about this?

277
00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:22,680
I'll watch the baby

278
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:25,070
and you two can spend the
afternoon in bed gettin' sticky.

279
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:30,010
Ah, well, uh, as lovely
as that sounds,

280
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:33,010
I wasn't really planning
on seeing Naomi today.

281
00:11:33,090 --> 00:11:35,290
Why not? What's wrong?

282
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,260
Oh, please don't tell me
there's something wrong.

283
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:39,720
I mean, you ain't much, but
you're the best she ever had.

284
00:11:40,830 --> 00:11:43,270
No, no, nothing's wrong.

285
00:11:43,330 --> 00:11:45,390
I just... I have to go
to work today.

286
00:11:45,470 --> 00:11:47,270
Oh, right.

287
00:11:47,330 --> 00:11:48,660
Silly me.

288
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:51,240
Naomi never dated anybody
with a job before.

289
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:55,270
At least not one
that's indoors and legal.

290
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:57,470
I understand.

291
00:11:57,540 --> 00:11:59,610
Well, you let me know
if you need anything.

292
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:00,650
I will.

293
00:12:00,710 --> 00:12:02,240
Ironing, groceries?

294
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,160
I could lance that ear for you.

295
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:06,220
Uh, no, thanks.

296
00:12:06,290 --> 00:12:07,660
I know what I'm doin'.

297
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:10,590
I spent a summer castrating
sheep in Montana.

298
00:12:11,690 --> 00:12:13,620
I'll keep that in mind.

299
00:12:13,690 --> 00:12:15,420
Uh, but I think it's fine.

300
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:16,470
Okay.

301
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:21,100
You made an old lady
very happy, Alan.

302
00:12:21,170 --> 00:12:23,480
I'm...

303
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:25,310
glad.

304
00:12:27,210 --> 00:12:28,680
Bye-bye now.

305
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:31,070
Bye-bye.

306
00:12:34,710 --> 00:12:37,580
Oh, I am so screwed.

307
00:12:37,650 --> 00:12:39,380
Charlie?

308
00:12:39,450 --> 00:12:41,250
I'm in the bathroom,
Alan.

309
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:43,150
Um...

310
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:45,220
I've got kind
of a delicate problem.

311
00:12:45,290 --> 00:12:48,520
The antibiotics are
in my dresser drawer.

312
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,070
(toilet flushing)
No, no, it's, it's Berta.

313
00:12:50,130 --> 00:12:51,740
She's being ridiculously nice
to me

314
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:54,510
and I'm afraid what might happen
if I break up with her daughter.

315
00:12:54,570 --> 00:12:57,540
Oh, you can't break up
with her daughter.

316
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,170
Whaddya mean I can't break up
with her?

317
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:02,710
Well, I guess
you could, but...

318
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:07,120
So what am I
supposed to do,

319
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:09,140
marry Naomi just
to keep Berta happy?

320
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:10,690
You don't have
to marry her.

321
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:13,550
Just let the relationship
follow its natural course.

322
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:14,820
Natural course?

323
00:13:14,890 --> 00:13:16,560
Think about it, Alan.

324
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:20,290
Any woman, given enough time,
will grow to loathe you.

325
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:24,870
My God, you're right.

326
00:13:24,930 --> 00:13:27,230
So I just have to stick it out
with Naomi

327
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:28,600
until she hates my guts.

328
00:13:28,670 --> 00:13:29,610
How long could it take?

329
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,100
BERTA:
Damn it.

330
00:13:32,170 --> 00:13:34,700
Charlie, get your lazy ass out
of that bed.

331
00:13:34,770 --> 00:13:37,510
Hello, bright eyes.

332
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:39,280
Hi.

333
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:41,150
I bagged you a lunch
to take to work.

334
00:13:41,210 --> 00:13:42,110
No kidding.

335
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:43,350
Yeah.

336
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:45,590
I also tossed in a
packet of vitamin E.

337
00:13:45,650 --> 00:13:48,150
Help you chalk up the
old pool cue for Naomi.

338
00:13:49,790 --> 00:13:50,760
Thanks.

339
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:52,720
C'mere, gimme some sugar.

340
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:54,190
Mwah.

341
00:13:59,770 --> 00:14:03,210
Oh, you are so screwed.

342
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,570
Here you go.

343
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:09,250
One hot chocolate
for the lactating mommy.

344
00:14:09,310 --> 00:14:10,820
Thank you.

345
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:13,750
I see little Brittany Pam
is having the grande boobaccino.

346
00:14:13,810 --> 00:14:14,880
Yeah,

347
00:14:14,950 --> 00:14:16,850
and she's bitin' the straw.

348
00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:20,780
Listen, you got any plans
for Saturday night?

349
00:14:20,850 --> 00:14:22,580
I don't think so. Why?

350
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:25,730
Well, my mom wants to have a big
family dinner over at her place.

351
00:14:25,790 --> 00:14:26,890
Family?

352
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:28,530
Uh, whose family?

353
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:32,440
You know, me, you, Jake,
Charlie, my mom, your mom.

354
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:33,710
Oh, oh.

355
00:14:33,770 --> 00:14:35,240
Well, uh, that sounds like fun.

356
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:36,630
Doesn't it?
Yeah.

357
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:38,600
Yeah, unfortunately,
I'm busy this Saturday.

358
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:39,870
But you just said...

359
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:41,650
I misspoke.

360
00:14:41,710 --> 00:14:43,680
Oh, I get it.

361
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:45,570
I'm not good enough
to meet your mother.

362
00:14:45,650 --> 00:14:47,650
Oh, no, no, no,
I'm, I'm just, uh,

363
00:14:47,710 --> 00:14:48,840
I'm concerned about the baby.

364
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:50,720
Why?

365
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:54,620
Oh, boy, uh, I was hoping I
wouldn't have to tell you this,

366
00:14:54,690 --> 00:14:57,560
but my mother...

367
00:14:57,620 --> 00:15:01,660
feeds on the souls of the young.

368
00:15:01,730 --> 00:15:03,700
Okay, just forget it.

369
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:05,490
Oh, come on,
Naomi, I mean,

370
00:15:05,570 --> 00:15:06,840
don't you think a family
dinner's pushing things

371
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:08,270
a little too fast?

372
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:09,710
Too fast?
You weren't worried

373
00:15:09,770 --> 00:15:11,580
about things going too fast
on our first date

374
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:13,310
when you chewed
through my nursing bra.

375
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:16,670
In my defense, I didn't
know about the flaps.

376
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:19,310
Well, I thought that
you were different.

377
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:20,720
I am different.
Ask anybody.

378
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:22,310
They'll tell ya,
Alan's different.

379
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:24,650
No, no, no, you're not.

380
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,260
You're just like all the rest.

381
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:29,590
Flirtsy, squirtsy
and then arriva-dirtsy.

382
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:31,260
Naomi, I didn't mean...
Well, I'm not that

383
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:32,920
kind of girl anymore.

384
00:15:32,990 --> 00:15:35,960
I'm a mama now and I demand
to be treated with respect!

385
00:15:36,030 --> 00:15:37,470
Sweetie, sweetie,
calm down.

386
00:15:37,530 --> 00:15:38,960
I do respect you.

387
00:15:39,030 --> 00:15:40,960
I just thought the dinner
was a little premature.

388
00:15:41,030 --> 00:15:42,830
Premature?

389
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:45,430
You weren't worried about being
premature on our first date

390
00:15:45,510 --> 00:15:47,310
when you ruined
a perfectly good sweater!

391
00:15:47,370 --> 00:15:48,270
You know what? You know what?

392
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:49,540
Saturday's fine.

393
00:15:49,610 --> 00:15:50,780
Dinner sounds great.
We'll be there.

394
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:53,510
Yeah, damn right
you'll be there.

395
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:57,010
What you never seen a screamin'
woman with a bare boob?

396
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:04,490
This is just mortifying.

397
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,600
Mom.

398
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:08,730
It's one thing to diddle
the help, Alan.

399
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,770
It's another thing
to dine with them.

400
00:16:12,030 --> 00:16:14,000
Jake, are you listening
to your iPod?

401
00:16:14,070 --> 00:16:17,580
No.
Well, start.

402
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:19,910
Naomi is not the help.

403
00:16:19,970 --> 00:16:21,500
Oh, forgive me.

404
00:16:21,570 --> 00:16:24,740
She's the maid's
round-heeled daughter.

405
00:16:24,810 --> 00:16:27,680
I mean, I'd expect this
from Charlie.

406
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:29,720
He'd hump
a grilled cheese sandwich.

407
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:31,280
Thanks, Mom.

408
00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:32,580
You're welcome, darling.

409
00:16:32,650 --> 00:16:35,950
And what, pray, is going
on with your ear?

410
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:37,720
Uh, it's fine.

411
00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:39,520
It looks like
a cherry tomato.

412
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:42,890
His lady friend thinks
it's "darn sexy."

413
00:16:44,030 --> 00:16:45,630
Well, don't worry.

414
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:47,470
I'm guessing you won't
be the only one

415
00:16:47,530 --> 00:16:49,700
at the table tonight
with a raging infection.

416
00:16:49,770 --> 00:16:51,610
It's not infected.

417
00:16:51,670 --> 00:16:54,640
It's got a pulse, Alan.

418
00:16:54,710 --> 00:16:56,580
Look, Mom, there
is no reason

419
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:58,010
to look down your
nose at Naomi.

420
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:00,420
She and her mother are
decent, hard-working,

421
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:01,640
salt-of-the-Earth people.

422
00:17:01,710 --> 00:17:04,050
Well, pardon me.

423
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:07,660
You know, it's tacky
to arrive empty-handed.

424
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:08,980
Perhaps we should stop

425
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:12,900
and pickup a box of wine
or some aerosol cheese.

426
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:15,600
Oh, Mom, you're on fire tonight.

427
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:16,820
It's the new meds.

428
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:18,070
They mix well with liquor.

429
00:17:18,130 --> 00:17:21,800
Oh, this was a bad idea.

430
00:17:21,870 --> 00:17:25,740
Charlie, didn't you tell him
that's the gay ear?

431
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:39,010
This is some
nice flatware.

432
00:17:39,090 --> 00:17:42,130
I, I gave this same pattern
to Charlie for his birthday.

433
00:17:42,190 --> 00:17:44,130
Yeah, he gave it to me.

434
00:17:44,190 --> 00:17:46,550
Next year,
he wants a roasting pan.

435
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:50,830
You gave away
my flatware?

436
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:54,070
To be fair, Mom,
I gave it to you.

437
00:17:54,130 --> 00:17:57,900
So, Berta, nice house.

438
00:17:57,970 --> 00:17:59,130
When do we take the tour?

439
00:17:59,210 --> 00:18:00,880
Have you been to the can yet?

440
00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:01,700
Yeah.

441
00:18:01,770 --> 00:18:03,440
You took it.

442
00:18:03,510 --> 00:18:05,540
Oh, okay.

443
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:09,540
I wanna make a toast.

444
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:11,890
Oh, good, a reason to drink.

445
00:18:11,950 --> 00:18:13,650
To Naomi and Alan.

446
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:16,120
Thank God they found each other.

447
00:18:16,190 --> 00:18:18,600
'Cause, let's face it, they were
both running out of options.

448
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:20,730
Hear, hear.
Hang on, hang on.

449
00:18:20,790 --> 00:18:23,660
Uh, I'd like to propose
an addendum to the toast,

450
00:18:23,730 --> 00:18:26,390
uh, a subordinate clause
if you will.

451
00:18:26,470 --> 00:18:29,710
Uh, while Naomi and I are
enjoying each other's company,

452
00:18:29,770 --> 00:18:31,580
we, uh, we are proceeding

453
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:33,410
in a very slow
and cautious manner.

454
00:18:33,470 --> 00:18:35,400
Except when we're having sex.

455
00:18:36,510 --> 00:18:37,980
Time and place, Naomi.

456
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:40,040
Time and place.

457
00:18:40,110 --> 00:18:42,440
Yeah, well, I wish you'd spend
a little more time

458
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:43,690
and aim for the right place.

459
00:18:44,950 --> 00:18:47,620
Oh, God, just kill me now.

460
00:18:47,690 --> 00:18:49,030
Jake?

461
00:18:49,090 --> 00:18:50,960
Headphones?
Thataboy.

462
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:53,690
Excuse me, uh...

463
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:55,790
I'd like to say a few words

464
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:57,560
before we fold up
the dining room table

465
00:18:57,630 --> 00:18:59,160
and commence the square dancing.

466
00:18:59,230 --> 00:19:04,070
Alan, you're my son
and I love you.

467
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:07,480
But you and I are through.

468
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:09,750
What?

469
00:19:09,810 --> 00:19:11,480
I just can't bear it anymore.

470
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:12,770
I have to cut you loose.

471
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:15,020
Is that all it takes?

472
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:16,940
Hey, Berta, you got
any other daughters?

473
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:18,560
(knocking)

474
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:20,460
HECTOR:
Naomi? Are you in there?

475
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:21,660
Hector?

476
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:22,950
Go away! Nobody's home!

477
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:24,590
Mom!

478
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:27,460
If that loser steps one foot
inside this house,

479
00:19:27,530 --> 00:19:29,030
I'm gettin' out my nail gun.

480
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:32,740
Oh, wonderful, we're gonna be
on an episode of Cops.

481
00:19:34,830 --> 00:19:36,060
What are you doing here?

482
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:37,640
I've come to see my daughter.

483
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:39,470
Is that her?
What do you care?

484
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:41,080
You ran off.
No, I didn't
run off, mija.

485
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:43,500
I couldn't get back
across the border.

486
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:45,520
They're crackin' down
'cause of these damn Arabs.

487
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:47,550
Why didn't you call me?

488
00:19:47,610 --> 00:19:48,840
I did call.

489
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:51,760
Didn't your mother
give you my messages?

490
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:54,260
Whoops.

491
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:57,080
Oh, Hector,
I've missed you so much.

492
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:58,500
I missed you too.

493
00:19:59,730 --> 00:20:00,800
Alan.

494
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:02,620
Yeah?

495
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:05,800
Your relationship has run
its natural course.

496
00:20:05,870 --> 00:20:10,640
She doesn't hate me yet.
She, she's just like...

497
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:13,230
A toast to Hector and Naomi.

498
00:20:13,310 --> 00:20:15,510
May their love last forever.

499
00:20:15,570 --> 00:20:16,770
Salud.
Hear, hear.

500
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:18,740
What's with your ear?

501
00:20:18,810 --> 00:20:20,740
I'm gay.

502
00:20:40,070 --> 00:20:41,870
Berta?

503
00:20:41,930 --> 00:20:43,260
Don't bother me, Charlie.

504
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:45,640
I had a hard night.

505
00:20:45,710 --> 00:20:48,850
If you're so tired, why
don't you just stay home?

506
00:20:48,910 --> 00:20:50,480
Are you kidding?

507
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:53,540
Hector invited his entire
family over to see the baby.

508
00:20:53,610 --> 00:20:56,340
It's like the Alamo
over there.

509
00:20:57,620 --> 00:20:58,820
Well, for the record,

510
00:20:58,890 --> 00:21:00,460
I didn't get
any sleep either.

511
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:02,330
Halfway home
Alan's ear blew up

512
00:21:02,390 --> 00:21:04,530
and we had to take him
to the emergency room.

513
00:21:04,590 --> 00:21:06,490
Is he okay?

514
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:08,730
Yeah, they were able
to save the lobe,

515
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:10,600
but I don't think
anyone's gonna call it

516
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:12,690
the gay ear anymore.

517
00:21:12,770 --> 00:21:14,940
Huh.

518
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,800
Well, sweet dreams.

519
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:20,480
You too.
