1
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:15,250
"Mudslide Kills
600 Religious Pilgrims."

2
00:00:15,310 --> 00:00:18,540
And yet, both my ex-wives
live on.

3
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:25,620
Morning.

4
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:28,560
Morning.
Uh-oh.

5
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:32,230
Not again.
Please, not again.

6
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:34,660
Thank God.

7
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:39,610
Always in the last place
you look, huh?

8
00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:40,930
Uh-huh.

9
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:42,310
Have a nice day.

10
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:45,580
(weakly):
You, too.

11
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:50,440
Yeah, Phil, it's Charlie.

12
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:52,310
Put me down for a grand
on Detroit tonight.

13
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:54,010
What's the line now?

14
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:55,620
Well, excuse me.

15
00:00:55,690 --> 00:00:57,960
But don't you think
if the gambler is awake,

16
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:01,350
it behooves the bookie
to be up as well?

17
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:05,000
All right, well, call me
when you get off the can.

18
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:07,090
Are you aware that
your sleepover buddy

19
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:09,270
was packing heat?
Oh, yeah.

20
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:12,330
Any hotter and she'd have
burned my pubes clean off.

21
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,700
Charlie,
a gun in the house?

22
00:01:14,770 --> 00:01:16,540
Relax, she's a cop.

23
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:18,250
Or was a cop.

24
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:21,320
Or is wanted by the cops.

25
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:24,050
I know she
mentioned cops.

26
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:27,120
Unbelievable.
So this was another
one-night stand?

27
00:01:27,190 --> 00:01:30,260
Unless she comes back
for her handcuffs, yeah.

28
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:33,420
Boy, how much satisfaction
can you get from that?

29
00:01:33,490 --> 00:01:34,390
Handcuffs?

30
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:36,070
Not really my thing.

31
00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:38,070
But, hey, she probably
did some stuff last night

32
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:39,740
that might not have
been her first choice.

33
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:42,440
No, I mean,

34
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:44,200
how can you possibly
get any satisfaction

35
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:46,540
from an endless series of
alcohol-soaked one-night stands?

36
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:49,000
And even as the words
are coming out of my mouth

37
00:01:49,070 --> 00:01:52,040
I realize it's a stupid
question, so forget I said it.

38
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:54,510
She's married to a cop.

39
00:01:56,350 --> 00:01:58,390
You know, I hate to see you
wasting your life

40
00:01:58,450 --> 00:02:00,620
having drunken sex with women
you don't care about.

41
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:03,980
Well, who asked you
to move back in and watch?

42
00:02:04,050 --> 00:02:05,280
You know who was good for you?

43
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:06,630
Don't go there, Alan.

44
00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:07,690
Mia.

45
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,130
She was beautiful,
she was smart.

46
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:10,590
She got you to
clean up your act.

47
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:12,190
I'm telling you, Charlie,
letting her go

48
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:13,630
was the stupidest thing
you've ever done.

49
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:15,240
You're going there, Alan.

50
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:17,510
I'm just saying you had
this fantastic woman

51
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:20,140
who was willing to marry you
and you just threw it away.

52
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:21,170
And for what?

53
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:23,150
Okay, you're there.

54
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:26,240
You want to know
why I gave up Mia?

55
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:28,170
I'll tell you why
I gave up Mia.

56
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:30,020
I gave her up for you.

57
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:30,610
Oh, oh, for me?
Yeah.

58
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:32,350
Yeah, for you.

59
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:34,660
She wanted you to move out
so we'd have the house

60
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,230
to ourselves,
but I said no way.

61
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:38,490
I am not throwing my brother
out on the street.

62
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:43,060
Wow.

63
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:44,170
What a loving gesture.

64
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:46,170
Oh, bite me.

65
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:48,770
And you know what you did?

66
00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:50,400
You married Candy
and moved out anyway.

67
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:52,280
So if you want to know

68
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:54,480
why I let the best thing that
ever happened to me get away,

69
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:56,510
it's so the worst thing
that could ever happen to me

70
00:02:56,570 --> 00:02:58,500
would have a place to live.

71
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:02,210
Oh.

72
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:04,140
(mimics):
Oh.

73
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:06,090
Well, I...

74
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:08,480
I guess it all worked out
for the best, huh?

75
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:10,220
How do you figure?

76
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:11,630
Well, think about it.

77
00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:13,760
If Mia had been living here
when Candy kicked me out

78
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:15,190
and I came back...

79
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:18,300
would've been a very
awkward situation.

80
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:26,840
Oh!

81
00:03:32,210 --> 00:03:33,270
ALAN:
Charlie?

82
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:35,280
Huh?

83
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,240
Oh. Yeah.

84
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:39,460
Awkward.

85
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:43,780
♪ Men, men, men, men, manly men,
men, men ♪

86
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:46,790
*Ah.
♪ Men. ♪

87
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,640
not my psychiatrist.

88
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:55,870
If I want to bet every single
game in the country

89
00:03:55,930 --> 00:04:00,800
with money I don't have,
that's my business.

90
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:02,370
Thank you.

91
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:05,440
Now, let's talk boxing.

92
00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:07,180
Really?

93
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:09,720
There's no fights anywhere
tonight?

94
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:11,880
Okay, well, how are you
and your wife getting along?

95
00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:15,690
What? It'd be a fair fight.

96
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:17,850
She's got, like,
50 pounds on you.

97
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:22,570
Hello?

98
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:24,300
My luck.
I got to have a bookie

99
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:27,730
who's afraid to fight
out of his weight class.

100
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,810
Aren't you a little worried
that all this betting

101
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:30,910
might be turning into a problem?

102
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:33,210
Alan, if you don't bet big,

103
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:34,800
you can't cover your losses.

104
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:36,640
And if you can't cover
your losses,

105
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:38,550
a large man with a tire iron

106
00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:40,420
puts your address into MapQuest,
at which point,

107
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,180
you have to sneak across the
Mexican border

108
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:43,890
dressed in women's clothing.

109
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:48,490
Now that's when
you have a problem.

110
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:50,250
Well, you know best.

111
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,420
You hungry?

112
00:04:51,490 --> 00:04:52,930
I made your
favorite sandwich.

113
00:04:52,990 --> 00:04:55,590
Turkey, ham and pastrami.

114
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:58,630
Gobble.
(snorts) (moos)

115
00:04:59,730 --> 00:05:01,690
No, thanks.

116
00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:03,740
Okay. Uh, how about
something sweet?

117
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:04,800
Key lime pie.

118
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:06,210
Yummy, yummy.

119
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:09,500
Look, Alan, I appreciate
your sucking up,

120
00:05:09,570 --> 00:05:12,310
but you can't fill
the gaping wound in my heart

121
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:14,220
with deli meat.

122
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:16,810
And pie.

123
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:20,220
Yummy.

124
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:22,320
Can't we just leave it alone?

125
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:24,460
Can we not grind on and on

126
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:26,920
about the stupidest thing
I've ever done?

127
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:28,550
Okay, okay, I'm
sorry I said that.

128
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:29,930
Giving up Mia was not

129
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:31,360
the stupidest thing
you've ever done.

130
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,760
It certainly wasn't as stupid
as when you came back from Rio

131
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:36,500
with that gorgeous model—
you know, the one

132
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:38,270
with the Adam's apple and the
really big hands?

133
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:43,550
You know, I'm going
to give you some space.

134
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:46,580
I'll maybe go for a nice drive.

135
00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:50,950
(sighs)

136
00:05:51,010 --> 00:05:52,610
(door opens)

137
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:54,610
Forgot my keys.

138
00:05:54,690 --> 00:05:56,220
Aah! Oh!

139
00:05:56,290 --> 00:05:57,490
Uh, you know what?

140
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:58,960
They-They must have slipped out

141
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:00,920
of my pocket and into the couch.

142
00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:02,920
Um...

143
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:04,690
Excuse me. Sorry.

144
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:06,690
(grunting)

145
00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:10,230
Right. Sorry.

146
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:11,800
(grunting)

147
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:15,010
Oh.

148
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:16,300
Found some change.

149
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:19,470
Oh, uh, look.

150
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:22,840
Is that a quarter in your ear?

151
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:27,360
(groaning)

152
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:29,390
(grunting)

153
00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:33,030
Tada!

154
00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:37,530
Very impressive.

155
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,870
♪ Men.

156
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:44,600
MAN:

157
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:47,410

00:06:52,810 --> 00:06:54,270
What is that?

161
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:56,540
Steven Tyler rented the house
next door.

162
00:06:56,610 --> 00:06:58,480
(singing continues)

163
00:06:58,550 --> 00:07:00,590
The-The guy
from Aerosmith?

164
00:07:00,650 --> 00:07:02,310
I lost my
virginity to him.

165
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:05,480
You-You know, his music.

166
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:08,530
Thanks. I was confused.

167
00:07:08,590 --> 00:07:12,490
(loud, howling scat singing)

168
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:15,260
Apparently getting ready
for a tour.

169
00:07:15,330 --> 00:07:17,900
So what's...?

170
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:21,810
(loud scat singing continues)

171
00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:24,070
in the box?

172
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:26,510
Oh, I just went out and picked
you up a little something

173
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:28,020
I thought might put a smile
on your face.

174
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,890
Alan, the only thing in this box

175
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:34,860
that could possibly put a smile
on my face is your severed head.

176
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:37,990
(laughing)

177
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:39,260
Good one.

178
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:40,250
Zing!

179
00:07:42,330 --> 00:07:43,670
Come on, open it.

180
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:45,670
(scat singing continues)

181
00:07:47,930 --> 00:07:49,860
A hat?

182
00:07:49,930 --> 00:07:51,300
A very expensive hat.

183
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:53,580
Since when do I wear hats?

184
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:57,050
Well, you don't, but, uh,
I saw it, and it seemed so you.

185
00:07:57,110 --> 00:08:00,580
You know, cool, rakish,
yet, forgiving.

186
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:03,580
Okay, fine, I forgive you.

187
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:05,150
Oh, thanks.
Thanks.

188
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:07,790
Aren't you going to try it on?

189
00:08:07,850 --> 00:08:09,550
No.

190
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:13,550
If you really forgave me,
you'd try it on.

191
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:15,590
(sighs)
(scat singing continues
in distance)

192
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:17,600
Oh, yeah.

193
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:19,260
That is you.

194
00:08:19,330 --> 00:08:21,970
Let's, uh, let's
try tilting it a
little bit here.

195
00:08:22,030 --> 00:08:23,330
Oh, baby.

196
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:24,960
(laughing):
You got to
see this.

197
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:27,110
Yeah, come on inside,
we'll take a look.

198
00:08:27,170 --> 00:08:29,070
Charlie, you coming?

199
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:36,750
What's going on?

200
00:08:36,810 --> 00:08:39,110
You should leave, Alan.

201
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:40,050
Why?

202
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:42,160
Just trust me.

203
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:44,460

for the cause!

Ah, sorry, man.

208

Thank you and
good night!

211
00:09:19,290 --> 00:09:22,900
How cool is it that Steven Tyler
moved in next door?

212
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:27,100
I lost my virginity
to him.

213
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:28,260
You mean his music?

214
00:09:28,330 --> 00:09:30,130
No.

215
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:33,230
Nice hat.

216
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:34,800
Thanks.

217
00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:36,540
Boy, you look
like hell.

218
00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:40,520
Well, that's strange,
'cause I feel like crap.

219
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:43,190
How long do you think
you can keep it up?

220
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:47,060
What exactly are
we talking about?

221
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:50,730
The excessive drinking,
the obsessive partying,

222
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:52,160
the compulsive gambling.

223
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:54,220
Oh. Hard to say.

224
00:09:54,290 --> 00:09:56,860
I try and take it
one day at a time.

225
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:58,670
You do realize

226
00:09:58,730 --> 00:10:01,800
this is all just an attempt
to avoid feeling your feelings.

227
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:04,040
Let me tell you something
about feelings.

228
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:06,260
Feelings are like
your mother's breasts.

229
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:10,150
You know where they are,
but they're best left unfelt.

230
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:12,280
It's an interesting analogy,
but may I point out

231
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:13,840
that a mother's breasts
are a source

232
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:15,270
of nourishment and comfort?

233
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:17,990
Yeah, well, my mother's breasts
were a source

234
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:20,220
of silicone and Russian vodka.

235
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:22,210
Not good for child-rearing,

236
00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:25,060
but she was a big hit
at parties.

237
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:28,320
Charlie, I know how much
it hurt you to give up Mia,

238
00:10:28,390 --> 00:10:30,720
and I know you don't like
that feeling,

239
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:33,260
but the more you try
to get rid of it,

240
00:10:33,330 --> 00:10:36,260
the more it's going
to come back.

241
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:39,030
Oh, yeah.

242
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:40,900
Perfect fit.

243
00:10:40,970 --> 00:10:43,640
It's like somebody measured
your head while you were asleep

244
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:46,650
so when your brother called
she could tell him the size.

Yours.

254
00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:18,340
Really?
Yeah.

255
00:11:18,410 --> 00:11:20,180
It looks great with the 'stache.

You know, it just
occurred to me

257
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:24,780
that I have been
feeling guilty

258
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:26,660
because you called off
your wedding to Mia

259
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:27,960
so that I wouldn't have
to move out.

260
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:29,960
But then when I did move out,

261
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:30,920
you didn't call her.

262
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:32,290
Yeah, so?

263
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:34,060
So, you know why
I think you didn't call her?

264
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:35,820
You didn't call her
because the whole

265
00:11:35,890 --> 00:11:38,290
I don't want to throw my brother
out on the street business

266
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:39,660
was a very convenient
and noble excuse

267
00:11:39,730 --> 00:11:40,730
to get out of the marriage.

268
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,300
That's what you think, huh?

269
00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:44,910
Yes, that's what I think.
That's what you think?

270
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:46,780
You heard me.
That's what I think.

271
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:50,310
Yeah, well...
think again.

272
00:11:50,370 --> 00:11:52,100
Admit it, Charlie,
I've been beating myself up,

273
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:53,220
buying you pie and hats

274
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:54,950

There was. Berta ate it.

is he wearing your hat?

278
00:12:05,290 --> 00:12:06,260
I gave it to him.

279
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,890
I bought this hat
for you.

280
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:11,230
And I gave it to Jake.

281
00:12:11,290 --> 00:12:13,030
You can't commit
to anything, can you?

282
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:14,670
It's just a hat!

283
00:12:14,730 --> 00:12:16,430
It's not just a hat.
It's a symbol.

00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:19,140
Of...

286
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,930
Okay, it's just a hat, but

287
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,070
the point is,
you have nobody to blame

288
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:24,940
for your miserable, lonely
existence but yourself.

289
00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:26,880
And you can drink, gamble
and hump all you want,

290
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:29,070
but one day, you're going
to have to face that fact.

Drink, gamble and hump!

292
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:35,320
Yeah, well, I don't have
to face anything

I don't want to face,

00:16:11,530 --> 00:16:13,300
Then why are you
laughing so much?

363
00:16:13,370 --> 00:16:16,900
I don't know.

364
00:16:16,970 --> 00:16:20,440
Dad, something's wrong
with Uncle Charlie.

365
00:16:20,510 --> 00:16:21,940
What's going on?

366
00:16:22,010 --> 00:16:23,140
(laughing):
Hey, Jake,

367
00:16:23,210 --> 00:16:24,340
tell your dad

368
00:16:24,410 --> 00:16:26,580
how one-legged girls work
at Ihop.

369
00:16:30,050 --> 00:16:31,550
Oh, no.

370
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:33,220
I gave away the joke.

371
00:16:35,090 --> 00:16:38,420
I'm so sorry, Jake.

372
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:40,570
(voice breaking):
I've ruined everything.

373
00:16:42,230 --> 00:16:44,300
Is he okay?

374
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:47,280
He's fine. His feelings
are coming to the surface.

375
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:49,310
Oh, like when Mom gets PMS.

376
00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:52,350
Well, kind of.

377
00:16:52,410 --> 00:16:53,550
Hang on, Uncle Charlie.

378
00:16:53,610 --> 00:16:54,970
I'll get you some chocolate.

380
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,390

out there?

381
00:17:03,450 --> 00:17:04,980
A lanyard.

382
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:07,130
He's got a lot
of free time now,

383
00:17:07,190 --> 00:17:09,650
so I gave him one of
Jake's old hobby kits.

384
00:17:09,730 --> 00:17:12,100
You know, so he'd
have something to do.

385
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,090
I'm surprised
he's not making a vagina

386
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:17,360
out of macaroni
and bottle caps.

TYLER:
What?

395
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:47,660
Can you lay off
the harmonica-playing?

396
00:17:47,730 --> 00:17:51,030
Hey, a lot of
people pay to see
me play harmonica.

397
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:52,960
They pay to hear you sing.

398
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:55,410
They tolerate the harmonica!

399
00:17:55,470 --> 00:17:58,700
Sorry I don't
measure up to your
musical standards,

you lame ass
jingle-writer!

All right, let's see

402
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:03,950
how you play harmonica
out your other end.

403
00:18:04,010 --> 00:18:06,540
Now, now, now, now,
let's slow down
here. Come on.

Let's see what you've
got, jingle balls.

405
00:18:08,690 --> 00:18:09,990
Okay, I'm gonna rip off
your big, fat lips

406
00:18:10,050 --> 00:18:10,980
and use 'em
to kiss my ass!

407

Charlie,
please, please.

408
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:14,920
You know your emotions are a
little bit frayed right now.

Right, right. Okay, okay.

410
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:18,960

That's it!

413
00:18:22,770 --> 00:18:23,640
No, Charlie.
Charlie, wait!

414
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:25,160
Charlie, don't do this!

415

CHARLIE:
Come on, Tyler, you
want a piece of me?

416
00:18:30,070 --> 00:18:32,700
You know, the dude
may look like a lady,

417
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:35,080
but you fight like
a little girl.

418
00:18:37,150 --> 00:18:40,020
Did it ever occur
to you to help me out?

419
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:42,050
Well, yeah, but once
you were cowering

420
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:45,090
under his picnic
table, I figured
the worst was over.

421
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:48,660
Oh, quick thinking
squirting that bottle
of sunblock at him.

422
00:18:48,730 --> 00:18:51,870
I was hoping it would get
in his eyes and blind him.

423
00:18:51,930 --> 00:18:53,670
Yeah, well, all you did
was keep him

424
00:18:53,730 --> 00:18:55,930
from getting a nasty burn while
he beat the crap out of you.

425
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,040
Please, Alan, I'm begging you.

426
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:02,070
Okay. It's not
right to kick a
man when he's down.

427
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:03,780
Thanks.

428
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:08,140
Too bad Steven
Tyler didn't feel
that way, huh?

429
00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:14,190
You were right about Mia.

430
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:18,760

as an excuse

431
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:20,220
to call off the wedding.

This-This is
a real breakthrough.

434
00:19:28,570 --> 00:19:29,800
Doesn't it feel liberating

435
00:19:29,870 --> 00:19:31,940
to finally hear yourself
admit the truth?

436
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,100
Well, I feel something.

437
00:19:34,170 --> 00:19:37,000
But since I'm also hearing
a high-pitched whistle,

438
00:19:37,070 --> 00:19:39,070
it might just be a concussion.
