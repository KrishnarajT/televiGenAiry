1
00:00:11,495 --> 00:00:14,414
This is such a beautiful sunset.

2
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:16,375
Thanks.

3
00:00:17,709 --> 00:00:20,504
Thanks? You're taking credit
for the sunset?

4
00:00:21,046 --> 00:00:22,965
No, not— Not the sunset per se.

5
00:00:23,131 --> 00:00:24,925
But I did buy a house on the beach...

6
00:00:25,092 --> 00:00:27,469
so we can stand here
and watch the sunset...

7
00:00:27,636 --> 00:00:30,597
so thanks.

8
00:00:31,098 --> 00:00:33,433
Your house works with
a lot of women, doesn't it?

9
00:00:34,017 --> 00:00:38,522
Honestly, it's like a G-spot
with two mortgages.

10
00:00:39,523 --> 00:00:42,359
Just so you know, I'm not with you
for your house or your money.

11
00:00:42,901 --> 00:00:44,611
So it's the car.

12
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:46,363
Why would I care about your car?

13
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:48,657
It's an $80,000 Mercedes.

14
00:00:48,866 --> 00:00:51,201
Yeah, so? What does it do
that other cars don't do?

15
00:00:51,368 --> 00:00:52,953
It costs $80,000.

16
00:00:54,454 --> 00:00:57,541
Hey, I almost forgot.
I have something for you.

17
00:00:57,749 --> 00:01:00,377
Charlie, you don't have
to buy me expensive jewelry.

18
00:01:00,586 --> 00:01:03,839
Okay, nothing but cheap crap
from now on.

19
00:01:06,341 --> 00:01:07,676
It's beautiful.

20
00:01:07,843 --> 00:01:09,678
Read the inscription.

21
00:01:11,346 --> 00:01:14,391
"One month, two weeks, four days. "
What does it mean?

22
00:01:15,017 --> 00:01:20,606
Well, since we decided to go ahead and
consummate our relationship finally...

23
00:01:21,148 --> 00:01:24,318
I thought I should honor the time
we've already spent together.

24
00:01:24,484 --> 00:01:26,612
Exclusively.
In a committed relationship.

25
00:01:26,778 --> 00:01:31,700
Without any sex whatsoever.

26
00:01:32,784 --> 00:01:34,661
So unless we have sex
before midnight...

27
00:01:34,828 --> 00:01:37,497
you're gonna need to buy
a new bracelet?

28
00:01:37,914 --> 00:01:39,541
You're pretty sure of yourself.

29
00:01:42,085 --> 00:01:44,796
Well, since you went to all the trouble
to engrave it...

30
00:01:45,005 --> 00:01:47,758
Don't even ask what I used
as a chisel.

31
00:01:52,888 --> 00:01:54,556
- Kandi.
- Hello, Alan.

32
00:01:54,723 --> 00:01:57,809
Is Charlie available?
Because I wish to speak with him.

33
00:02:00,979 --> 00:02:02,939
Okay, why don't you just wait here...

34
00:02:03,106 --> 00:02:04,274
and I'll let him know.

35
00:02:04,441 --> 00:02:07,319
I would be immensely appreciative
if you would.

36
00:02:08,403 --> 00:02:09,863
Alrighty.

37
00:02:51,613 --> 00:02:53,782
What the hell does... this mean?

38
00:02:54,324 --> 00:02:56,034
- I was sending you a message.
- What?

39
00:02:56,201 --> 00:02:58,286
That you're a woman trapped
in a man's body?

40
00:02:59,079 --> 00:03:02,332
- Kandi's here.
- And you want me to call you Kandi?

41
00:03:02,874 --> 00:03:05,127
No, Kandi, the girl you were seeing
before Mia.

42
00:03:07,754 --> 00:03:09,381
She's been calling here for days.

43
00:03:09,548 --> 00:03:12,092
It's time you let her know
you're with another woman.

44
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:17,347
Yeah, Charlie, after all it's been
"one month, two weeks, four days. "

45
00:03:20,183 --> 00:03:23,270
Did you know that Alan's
a woman trapped in a man's body?

46
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:34,655
So you gonna go talk
to your ex-girlfriend?

47
00:03:34,822 --> 00:03:36,657
Okay, first of all, sweetheart...

48
00:03:36,824 --> 00:03:38,785
she's not really an ex-girlfriend.

49
00:03:38,951 --> 00:03:40,953
Her name's Kandi.

50
00:03:41,829 --> 00:03:43,164
Thanks, Alan.

51
00:03:44,123 --> 00:03:45,416
With a K.

52
00:03:46,042 --> 00:03:48,711
- Alan.
- And an l.

53
00:03:49,796 --> 00:03:53,716
So if Kandi with a K and an l
isn't your ex-girlfriend, then what is she?

54
00:03:54,342 --> 00:03:57,720
Well, l— l— I would say
she's more of a person...

55
00:03:57,887 --> 00:04:02,350
who would drop by
from time to time and—

56
00:04:02,517 --> 00:04:04,644
Yeah, that.

57
00:04:05,978 --> 00:04:09,023
Why haven't you told this person
that you're in a relationship?

58
00:04:09,232 --> 00:04:11,109
Her name's Kandi.

59
00:04:12,068 --> 00:04:13,486
Boy, you're on thin ice.

60
00:04:14,904 --> 00:04:17,240
I think we both know
why you didn't tell her.

61
00:04:17,406 --> 00:04:20,243
Well, if that's the case,
then this discussion is moot.

62
00:04:20,785 --> 00:04:22,995
We should go upstairs
while Alan goes back...

63
00:04:23,162 --> 00:04:24,956
and lies about my whereabouts.

64
00:04:25,164 --> 00:04:29,710
Well, I'm not half the liar you are,
but I'll give it a shot.

65
00:04:30,628 --> 00:04:33,256
Shall we go upstairs
and continue this conversation?

66
00:04:33,464 --> 00:04:35,299
Are you out of your freaking mind?

67
00:04:36,467 --> 00:04:39,220
Okay, you're mad, I get that.

68
00:04:39,762 --> 00:04:44,475
- So?
- Well, Kandi, it's like this.

69
00:04:46,394 --> 00:04:48,187
Charlie's with another woman.

70
00:04:49,021 --> 00:04:51,482
Don't lie to me, Alan.

71
00:04:52,817 --> 00:04:54,277
Okay.

72
00:04:54,443 --> 00:04:56,154
He's in Africa...

73
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:59,365
working as a scrub nurse
for Doctors Without Borders.

74
00:05:00,074 --> 00:05:02,952
Story of my life.

75
00:05:03,494 --> 00:05:05,079
That's the story of your life?

76
00:05:05,621 --> 00:05:07,248
It's not always a scrub nurse...

77
00:05:07,415 --> 00:05:09,750
but it's always Africa.

78
00:05:11,752 --> 00:05:13,921
Before you say anything,
I want you to know...

79
00:05:14,088 --> 00:05:18,259
I've anticipated problems like this.
Look on the other side of the bracelet.

80
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:21,804
"I'm very, very sorry. "

81
00:05:26,434 --> 00:05:30,479
Problem is, Charlie, that you don't
believe in this relationship.

82
00:05:31,022 --> 00:05:32,273
Not believe in it?

83
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:35,318
It's kept me from having sex
for over six weeks.

84
00:05:35,526 --> 00:05:38,487
It would be like not believing
in a serious groin pull.

85
00:05:38,696 --> 00:05:41,991
- You know what Kandi is?
- I try not to judge.

86
00:05:42,199 --> 00:05:45,912
She's a lifeboat. You're keeping
a lifeboat for when this ship sinks.

87
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:48,456
Hey, hey, hey, lifeboats
don't mean you expect...

88
00:05:48,623 --> 00:05:52,835
the ship to sink.
The relationship, if I may.

89
00:05:53,336 --> 00:05:56,130
What they mean is that you have
a healthy respect...

90
00:05:56,297 --> 00:05:59,258
for the power of the sea.

91
00:06:00,009 --> 00:06:01,719
Are you listening to yourself?

92
00:06:02,553 --> 00:06:06,223
Y eah, I just caught the last part.
Not well thought out. No.

93
00:06:06,724 --> 00:06:11,729
All my life guys have looked at me
like I'm just some kind of sex toy.

94
00:06:12,521 --> 00:06:14,357
Well, they're wrong.

95
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:17,109
Yeah, just because you're good
at something...

96
00:06:17,276 --> 00:06:19,820
doesn't mean you
should be pigeonholed.

97
00:06:27,703 --> 00:06:29,997
And the only reason
I'm so good at it...

98
00:06:30,164 --> 00:06:32,500
is because I practice.

99
00:06:35,795 --> 00:06:37,880
Of course,
all the practice in the world...

100
00:06:38,047 --> 00:06:41,258
isn't gonna help if you don't
love what you're doing.

101
00:06:45,513 --> 00:06:47,056
What do you want me to do, Mia?

102
00:06:47,223 --> 00:06:48,682
Call every woman I've known...

103
00:06:48,849 --> 00:06:50,851
to announce I'm now
in a relationship?

104
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:53,145
Hi, Shirley, this is Charlie Harper.

105
00:06:53,312 --> 00:06:56,816
We met at Disneyland
about 22 years ago.

106
00:06:57,233 --> 00:07:00,236
Yeah, Mr. Toad's Wild Ride.
That was me.

107
00:07:01,362 --> 00:07:04,240
Anyway, I thought you should know
I have a girlfriend now.

108
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:08,786
So I'd appreciate it if you
didn't call me. Okay, bye-bye.

109
00:07:09,662 --> 00:07:12,498
Well, that takes care of Shirley.
Now, what about Kandi?

110
00:07:12,706 --> 00:07:15,292
You want me to tell her?
Fine. I'll tell her.

111
00:07:15,751 --> 00:07:17,920
I'll go tell her right now.

112
00:07:19,713 --> 00:07:22,341
But before I cut
her loose completely...

113
00:07:22,508 --> 00:07:24,385
Iet me float a crazy idea by you.

114
00:07:26,929 --> 00:07:30,307
Sort of a win, win, win.

115
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:32,852
Are you out of your freaking mind?

116
00:07:33,811 --> 00:07:36,021
It was worth a shot.

117
00:07:38,649 --> 00:07:41,360
Kandi, before you say anything,
I want you to know...

118
00:07:41,527 --> 00:07:45,656
I'm in a committed relationship now
and I'm really in love with this woman.

119
00:07:45,823 --> 00:07:47,950
She's the best thing
that's happened to me...

120
00:07:48,159 --> 00:07:50,578
and I can't imagine
being with anyone else.

121
00:07:50,744 --> 00:07:53,330
Now, sweetheart.

122
00:07:54,248 --> 00:07:58,169
Don't cry.
I'm sure you'll find someone else.

123
00:08:01,005 --> 00:08:03,174
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

124
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:05,759
What?
I thought we were going upstairs.

125
00:08:05,968 --> 00:08:09,263
Okay, you're still mad. I get that.

126
00:08:14,894 --> 00:08:17,479
- I made your bed.
- Thank you.

127
00:08:17,688 --> 00:08:19,356
It's been real easy lately.

128
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:22,151
How nice for you.

129
00:08:22,359 --> 00:08:24,904
You haven't even been flying solo,
have you?

130
00:08:25,654 --> 00:08:26,989
That's a little personal.

131
00:08:27,198 --> 00:08:29,992
Hey, you want privacy,
wash your own sheets.

132
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:33,370
Once I get my mitts on them,
they're in the public domain.

133
00:08:33,537 --> 00:08:35,205
- Good morning.
- Morning.

134
00:08:35,372 --> 00:08:38,751
- How did it go with Mia last night?
- Based on his laundry, not well.

135
00:08:38,959 --> 00:08:42,880
- Why don't you tell the neighbors?
- Where do you think I'm going?

136
00:08:45,049 --> 00:08:47,468
By the way,
thanks for getting rid of Kandi for me.

137
00:08:47,635 --> 00:08:49,470
Hey, I'm your brother.
I got your back.

138
00:08:49,637 --> 00:08:51,096
Good to know.

139
00:08:51,263 --> 00:08:54,224
Hey, as long as we're on the subject,
I was wondering.

140
00:08:54,391 --> 00:08:57,895
Since you're swimming in
Lake Monogamy, as it were...

141
00:08:59,063 --> 00:09:02,232
would you mind if l, you know...

142
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:04,652
- ... asked Kandi out sometime?
- Go for it.

143
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:07,237
- Just wanted to make sure you're okay.
- I'm fine.

144
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:10,741
- Don't want you to feel weird.
- Thanks for your consideration.

145
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:13,827
Morning, Huggy Bear.

146
00:09:20,542 --> 00:09:22,169
So, Kandi, wanna go out sometime?

147
00:09:32,096 --> 00:09:34,390
Okay, I want you to know
I tracked down Kandi.

148
00:09:34,598 --> 00:09:36,308
I told her to move on and she has.

149
00:09:36,475 --> 00:09:39,228
So I got no lifeboats,
no life preservers, no water wings.

150
00:09:39,395 --> 00:09:41,855
If the ship goes down,
I'm going down with it.

151
00:09:42,064 --> 00:09:45,901
So there's no longer any reason to
put off you and me getting naked.

152
00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:48,779
Charlie, I'd like you
to meet my parents.

153
00:09:53,534 --> 00:09:54,576
Hello.

154
00:10:02,075 --> 00:10:04,077
What if Dad says I could stay up
to watch it?

155
00:10:04,244 --> 00:10:05,829
He won't.

156
00:10:06,038 --> 00:10:07,164
How do you know?

157
00:10:07,372 --> 00:10:10,667
Your father and I talk, so don't
try to play us against each other.

158
00:10:10,876 --> 00:10:13,462
I gotta try, it's what I do.

159
00:10:15,130 --> 00:10:16,757
Hi.

160
00:10:18,133 --> 00:10:20,594
Hello. Is Alan here?

161
00:10:21,136 --> 00:10:23,347
Father Huggy Bear.

162
00:10:24,222 --> 00:10:26,099
Yes, my child?

163
00:10:27,559 --> 00:10:30,103
- You've got company.
- Alan?

164
00:10:31,605 --> 00:10:34,775
- Stall them, stall them, stall them.
- Okay.

165
00:10:36,485 --> 00:10:37,694
You must be Jake.

166
00:10:38,737 --> 00:10:40,572
And you must be Jake's grandma.

167
00:10:46,662 --> 00:10:48,538
Judith, hi.

168
00:10:49,706 --> 00:10:50,957
Go watch some cartoons.

169
00:10:51,166 --> 00:10:53,377
- Okay.
- Cool.

170
00:10:57,506 --> 00:10:59,925
- Are you proud of yourself?
- What do you mean?

171
00:11:00,133 --> 00:11:02,010
Oh, please,
she has to be half your age.

172
00:11:02,177 --> 00:11:03,512
Oh, that.

173
00:11:03,678 --> 00:11:05,597
Yeah, I am pretty proud of that.

174
00:11:06,515 --> 00:11:08,350
What could you possibly
have in common?

175
00:11:08,517 --> 00:11:11,436
- What do you talk about?
- Talk?

176
00:11:12,062 --> 00:11:15,065
T o tell you the truth, we haven't
really done a lot of talking.

177
00:11:15,232 --> 00:11:18,276
I mean, I did hear her confession.

178
00:11:19,945 --> 00:11:22,614
She's been a very bad girl.

179
00:11:26,535 --> 00:11:28,078
I'm supposed to leave Jake here?

180
00:11:28,245 --> 00:11:30,288
What kind of message does
that send him?

181
00:11:30,455 --> 00:11:32,165
I don't know.
Dreams can come true.

182
00:11:32,332 --> 00:11:34,960
Life is beautiful. There is a God.

183
00:11:35,502 --> 00:11:38,213
Hey, Judith. Father.

184
00:11:39,047 --> 00:11:42,384
I suppose you're the one that
introduced Alan to that slutty little—

185
00:11:42,551 --> 00:11:45,470
Don't say it, Judith.
You'll just be demeaning all women.

186
00:11:45,637 --> 00:11:47,222
And yes.

187
00:11:47,806 --> 00:11:50,183
Figures. Well, I don't want
her around my son.

188
00:11:50,767 --> 00:11:53,854
Oh, really? So do I get to screen
the men that you're dating?

189
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:57,190
Let's not forget about the guy
who delivered the truckload of sod.

190
00:11:57,399 --> 00:11:59,860
- What about him?
- lt doesn't take two months...

191
00:12:00,026 --> 00:12:01,695
to put down a new lawn, Judith.

192
00:12:03,321 --> 00:12:06,241
Sounds like she got laid
before the sod did.

193
00:12:07,409 --> 00:12:09,619
I'm not gonna dignify that
with a response.

194
00:12:11,329 --> 00:12:13,957
Watch out for crab grass.

195
00:12:17,627 --> 00:12:20,297
So, what's Kandi, a nun?

196
00:12:20,505 --> 00:12:21,923
Catholic school girl.

197
00:12:22,090 --> 00:12:24,217
Oh, excellent choice.

198
00:12:25,093 --> 00:12:27,345
Oh, hey, how—?
How are things with Mia?

199
00:12:27,554 --> 00:12:30,473
Not bad. She forgives me.
Introduced me to her parents.

200
00:12:30,682 --> 00:12:32,601
Oh, yeah? How did that go?

201
00:12:33,310 --> 00:12:36,104
Well, you know,
those things are always awkward.

202
00:12:37,105 --> 00:12:40,066
The big news is I'm taking Mia
to the Bel Air Hotel tonight...

203
00:12:40,233 --> 00:12:43,445
where we will express our love
in the way that we were meant to.

204
00:12:43,612 --> 00:12:45,405
- Drunk and in a hurry?
- You got it.

205
00:12:50,243 --> 00:12:52,078
- How's the caviar?
- It's perfect.

206
00:12:52,287 --> 00:12:53,747
Everything's perfect.

207
00:12:54,456 --> 00:12:56,791
- Would you like a fire?
- Don't go to any trouble.

208
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,084
It's no trouble.

209
00:13:02,714 --> 00:13:05,425
Luckily I was a Boy Scout
in Beverly Hills.

210
00:13:05,634 --> 00:13:07,260
- Champagne?
- No, thanks.

211
00:13:07,469 --> 00:13:10,597
I wanna be completely present
for the first time we make love.

212
00:13:10,764 --> 00:13:12,432
Good for you.

213
00:13:13,558 --> 00:13:15,477
Don't you want to be present?

214
00:13:15,852 --> 00:13:17,729
Well, within reason.

215
00:13:18,688 --> 00:13:20,398
Come on.

216
00:13:21,316 --> 00:13:24,069
What do you say
we save the champagne?

217
00:13:24,235 --> 00:13:25,987
But I already opened it.

218
00:13:26,196 --> 00:13:28,031
Do you need alcohol
to make love to me?

219
00:13:28,239 --> 00:13:29,866
No, no.

220
00:13:30,033 --> 00:13:31,952
I don't need it.

221
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:34,037
Well, then.

222
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:40,877
Is something wrong?

223
00:13:41,044 --> 00:13:42,504
I don't know.

224
00:13:42,671 --> 00:13:45,590
I mean, we didn't hop into bed
on the first date.

225
00:13:45,799 --> 00:13:48,551
We've gotten to know each other.
We're not drinking.

226
00:13:48,718 --> 00:13:50,637
It's all so new to me.

227
00:13:51,262 --> 00:13:53,014
That's what makes it special.

228
00:13:53,223 --> 00:13:56,059
I just don't want either of us
to be disappointed...

229
00:13:56,226 --> 00:13:59,437
because one of us might not be...

230
00:13:59,604 --> 00:14:01,189
throwing their A-game tonight.

231
00:14:01,398 --> 00:14:04,234
- Are you nervous?
- No, no. Of course not.

232
00:14:04,401 --> 00:14:08,822
But, you know, of the two of us,
only one can fake an A-game.

233
00:14:09,406 --> 00:14:12,117
There's nothing that you could do
to disappoint me tonight.

234
00:14:12,283 --> 00:14:15,578
No, no, it's what I can't do
that might disappoint you.

235
00:14:15,787 --> 00:14:17,914
You just relax. I'll be right back.

236
00:14:19,207 --> 00:14:20,792
Okay.

237
00:15:18,016 --> 00:15:20,143
Why don't you put some music on?

238
00:15:23,938 --> 00:15:25,565
Okay.

239
00:15:25,773 --> 00:15:28,902
- Should I ask?
- I wish you wouldn't.

240
00:15:34,115 --> 00:15:37,368
I'm not supposed to play this
because my mom says it's too violent.

241
00:15:37,577 --> 00:15:38,995
It has to be violent.

242
00:15:39,162 --> 00:15:41,080
You can't negotiate with zombies.

243
00:15:42,415 --> 00:15:45,668
- Don't tell me, tell her.
- I don't think she likes me.

244
00:15:45,877 --> 00:15:47,545
She doesn't really like anybody.

245
00:15:47,712 --> 00:15:50,340
Except the guy who keeps
putting grass in our backyard.

246
00:15:52,717 --> 00:15:55,011
Okay, time for bed.

247
00:15:55,178 --> 00:15:57,263
- Just a little longer.
- I'm not sleepy.

248
00:15:59,224 --> 00:16:00,683
No, him.

249
00:16:01,559 --> 00:16:03,686
I get to stay up.

250
00:16:04,729 --> 00:16:06,648
- That's not fair.
- Jake.

251
00:16:06,814 --> 00:16:09,275
Just because she's a girl.

252
00:16:09,859 --> 00:16:11,986
- Wanna play?
- Oh, no, thanks.

253
00:16:12,153 --> 00:16:14,030
I— I thought maybe we could just talk.

254
00:16:14,572 --> 00:16:17,909
Hang on. Let me just saw off
this zombie's head.

255
00:16:19,369 --> 00:16:20,745
Good Lord.

256
00:16:20,912 --> 00:16:22,580
There we go.

257
00:16:22,789 --> 00:16:24,958
Now, let me save my work.

258
00:16:25,583 --> 00:16:26,751
Okay, all done.

259
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:28,962
Wanna have sex?

260
00:16:32,382 --> 00:16:34,842
Actually, I do.

261
00:16:35,009 --> 00:16:38,471
But maybe we could spend a little time
getting to know each other first.

262
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:40,807
All right.

263
00:16:40,974 --> 00:16:42,058
What do you wanna know?

264
00:16:43,893 --> 00:16:46,354
Well, do you have
any brothers or sisters?

265
00:16:46,938 --> 00:16:48,439
I do not. How about you?

266
00:16:53,528 --> 00:16:54,737
Well, Charlie.

267
00:16:55,488 --> 00:16:58,157
Oh, right, Charlie.

268
00:17:03,496 --> 00:17:05,790
- Do you like to read?
- Oh, yeah, I love reading.

269
00:17:05,957 --> 00:17:08,876
Oh, great, great, me too.
Read anything good lately?

270
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:11,337
You mean like books and magazines...

271
00:17:11,504 --> 00:17:14,340
not billboards
and text messages, right?

272
00:17:16,092 --> 00:17:18,636
- Yeah.
- Then, no.

273
00:17:22,557 --> 00:17:24,684
Do menus count?

274
00:17:29,230 --> 00:17:30,732
Are you ready for me?

275
00:17:31,816 --> 00:17:35,528
Mia, if I were any more ready,
I'd be done.

276
00:17:45,455 --> 00:17:46,914
Oh, jeez, I'm sorry. You okay?

277
00:17:47,081 --> 00:17:48,499
- I think so.
- Are you sure?

278
00:17:48,666 --> 00:17:50,460
Yeah, I'm fine.

279
00:17:55,006 --> 00:17:56,215
Are you okay?

280
00:18:10,605 --> 00:18:12,857
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

281
00:18:13,024 --> 00:18:15,067
But I think that's enough foreplay.

282
00:18:17,612 --> 00:18:20,948
You see, the thing for me was
that I never should have gotten married.

283
00:18:21,115 --> 00:18:22,909
I was young,
I didn't know who I was.

284
00:18:23,117 --> 00:18:26,871
And to be completely honest,
I was just afraid of being alone.

285
00:18:30,291 --> 00:18:32,335
Can I share something with you?

286
00:18:32,543 --> 00:18:35,379
Y es, please. This is communicating,
this is how we connect.

287
00:18:35,922 --> 00:18:40,092
You shouldn't tell people that stuff,
it makes you sound like a loser.

288
00:18:44,597 --> 00:18:47,099
No, it makes me sound like
a real human being.

289
00:18:47,266 --> 00:18:49,644
A person with feelings and flaws.

290
00:18:50,728 --> 00:18:53,731
Loser.

291
00:18:56,275 --> 00:19:00,112
- Why don't we just go have sex?
- Finally.

292
00:19:07,828 --> 00:19:09,914
Oh, cheer up.

293
00:19:10,414 --> 00:19:12,416
It wasn't that bad.

294
00:19:13,334 --> 00:19:16,254
There were parts of it that I liked.

295
00:19:17,213 --> 00:19:20,132
Can we please not go over
the game film now?

296
00:19:21,467 --> 00:19:24,220
- What's the big deal?
- What's the big deal?

297
00:19:24,428 --> 00:19:26,847
This is supposed to be the part
that I'm good at.

298
00:19:27,056 --> 00:19:28,224
You are.

299
00:19:28,391 --> 00:19:30,476
It was fine.

300
00:19:32,812 --> 00:19:34,188
I don't wanna hear fine.

301
00:19:34,355 --> 00:19:36,899
I wanna see the top of
your head blow off.

302
00:19:37,566 --> 00:19:39,110
It's not a carnival game.

303
00:19:39,276 --> 00:19:41,988
The object is not to swing
your mallet and ring my bell.

304
00:19:42,196 --> 00:19:44,240
Well, we disagree.

305
00:19:45,199 --> 00:19:46,993
That's just your ego talking.

306
00:19:47,159 --> 00:19:48,452
Charlie, listen to me.

307
00:19:48,619 --> 00:19:53,165
I love you, not your money or car
or your house or your skills in bed.

308
00:19:53,708 --> 00:19:55,501
What's left?

309
00:19:55,668 --> 00:19:57,628
- Charlie.
- Oh, come on. Come on.

310
00:19:57,795 --> 00:20:01,382
You're saying that if I was some
pencil-weenie guy living in a shack...

311
00:20:01,549 --> 00:20:05,177
and taking the bus to my job selling
oranges on the freeway off-ramp...

312
00:20:05,344 --> 00:20:08,472
- ... you'd still love me?
- Yes, I would still love you.

313
00:20:09,223 --> 00:20:12,018
- Okay, I understand now.
- Good.

314
00:20:12,184 --> 00:20:13,561
You're insane.

315
00:20:14,478 --> 00:20:16,147
Why? Because I love the real you?

316
00:20:16,355 --> 00:20:19,775
No, no, because you think
there is a real me.

317
00:20:20,901 --> 00:20:23,654
Would you believe I love you
if my eyes had rolled back...

318
00:20:23,821 --> 00:20:25,197
and my head had blown off?

319
00:20:25,865 --> 00:20:26,907
It would be a start.

320
00:20:28,242 --> 00:20:31,620
All right. I guess we're just
gonna have to try again.

321
00:20:34,999 --> 00:20:36,500
Hang on. Hang on.

322
00:20:36,709 --> 00:20:39,378
How am I gonna know
you're not faking it?

323
00:20:39,587 --> 00:20:43,299
If I was gonna fake it, don't you think
I would have done it the first time?

324
00:20:44,467 --> 00:20:46,218
Fair enough.

325
00:20:50,013 --> 00:20:52,807
- Hey, wanna hear something amusing?
- Always.

326
00:20:53,016 --> 00:20:54,642
According to my girlfriend...

327
00:20:54,809 --> 00:20:57,562
underneath all the superficial,
cool stuff in my life...

328
00:20:57,729 --> 00:20:59,189
there's actually a real me.

329
00:21:00,023 --> 00:21:03,109
- No kidding?
- Apparently, he's quite a guy.

330
00:21:03,902 --> 00:21:05,403
I'd like to meet him sometime.

331
00:21:05,612 --> 00:21:06,863
Don't hold your breath.

332
00:21:09,282 --> 00:21:12,577
My girlfriend, on the other hand,
has no idea who I really am...

333
00:21:12,785 --> 00:21:14,496
damn little desire to find out...

334
00:21:14,662 --> 00:21:17,332
and is only interested in
riding me like a mustang...

335
00:21:17,499 --> 00:21:20,001
and draining me of all bodily fluids.

336
00:21:21,669 --> 00:21:23,671
How do you feel about that?

337
00:21:24,214 --> 00:21:26,007
I think I love her.

338
00:21:27,133 --> 00:21:28,384
You know what...

339
00:21:28,551 --> 00:21:32,514
Iove isn't blind, it's retarded.
