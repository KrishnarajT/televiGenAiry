1
00:00:02,576 --> 00:00:04,328
Thank you.

2
00:00:05,538 --> 00:00:09,208
Oh, I knew it.
There's no extra foam in my latte.

3
00:00:09,375 --> 00:00:10,543
You ask for extra foam...

4
00:00:10,709 --> 00:00:14,046
you might as well be asking for
a piggyback ride, know what I mean?

5
00:00:14,505 --> 00:00:15,756
Charlie?

6
00:00:15,923 --> 00:00:17,466
Charlie?

7
00:00:17,633 --> 00:00:19,969
Oh, of course.

8
00:00:20,678 --> 00:00:22,888
Man's got a heat-seeking missile
in his pants.

9
00:00:24,348 --> 00:00:26,976
Is it too much to ask that
when we go out for coffee...

10
00:00:27,143 --> 00:00:31,355
you stay within earshot, so I'm not
talking to myself like a crazy person?

11
00:00:31,897 --> 00:00:34,984
And again, I'm talking to myself
like a crazy person.

12
00:00:35,317 --> 00:00:36,569
Look.

13
00:00:38,154 --> 00:00:40,281
Yes, I see.

14
00:00:40,448 --> 00:00:42,950
Girl pretty. Charlie like.

15
00:00:43,617 --> 00:00:45,661
No, girl magnificent.

16
00:00:46,328 --> 00:00:47,746
Charlie buy her Lexus.

17
00:00:49,915 --> 00:00:52,251
I thought we were gonna
hang out together...

18
00:00:52,418 --> 00:00:55,462
but obviously your neurotic need
for sex is more important...

19
00:00:55,629 --> 00:00:57,840
than spending time
with your only brother...

20
00:00:58,007 --> 00:01:01,343
who despite everything continues
to love you and is, by the way...

21
00:01:01,510 --> 00:01:03,888
your best hope for
a viable kidney transplant.

22
00:01:07,141 --> 00:01:09,226
You can get yourself home, right?

23
00:01:11,937 --> 00:01:14,231
What makes you think
that she's even available?

24
00:01:14,398 --> 00:01:17,693
Maybe she's married, maybe she's gay,
maybe she's a guy.

25
00:01:18,569 --> 00:01:22,364
Hey, I don't see a ring,
a girlfriend or a bulge.

26
00:01:22,531 --> 00:01:26,410
If you'll excuse me, it's time to do
that voodoo that I do do so well.

27
00:01:29,163 --> 00:01:30,664
Hi.

28
00:01:32,166 --> 00:01:35,127
- I'm Charlie.
- Don't care.

29
00:01:35,711 --> 00:01:38,547
- And you are?
- Not interested.

30
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:40,841
How do you know?

31
00:01:42,384 --> 00:01:43,886
I know.

32
00:01:46,096 --> 00:01:47,806
Okay then.

33
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:54,772
You think it's over?
Because it's not over.

34
00:01:55,272 --> 00:01:56,315
Oh, I'm sorry.

35
00:01:56,482 --> 00:02:00,235
I guess I was mislead by her complete
and utter indifference to you.

36
00:02:00,778 --> 00:02:02,738
Yeah, well, watch and learn.

37
00:02:04,114 --> 00:02:06,241
- So—
- Go away.

38
00:02:08,827 --> 00:02:10,955
How about now? Is it over now?

39
00:02:12,247 --> 00:02:14,041
It's not an exact science, Alan.

40
00:02:17,127 --> 00:02:20,589
Look, if you knew me at all and shut
me down, that would be one thing...

41
00:02:20,756 --> 00:02:25,636
but to be dismissed on a simple hello,
well, that's a tough pill to swallow.

42
00:02:26,053 --> 00:02:28,931
Would you rather I give it to you
in a suppository?

43
00:02:29,848 --> 00:02:33,060
- Well, to be perfectly honest—
- Goodbye.

44
00:02:35,729 --> 00:02:38,232
- Hey, hey, did you hear that?
- What?

45
00:02:38,399 --> 00:02:40,067
It's a— It's a fat lady...

46
00:02:40,234 --> 00:02:42,194
and she's singing.

47
00:02:43,362 --> 00:02:48,367
- You'd give up right now, wouldn't you?
- Charlie, Elvis has left the building.

48
00:02:48,534 --> 00:02:51,578
I think giving up is
a little moot at this point.

49
00:02:51,745 --> 00:02:53,914
Well, that attitude
is why you sleep alone...

50
00:02:54,081 --> 00:02:57,668
with a copy of Monster Boobs
magazine under your pillow.

51
00:02:59,503 --> 00:03:01,964
Stay out of my room.

52
00:03:29,808 --> 00:03:33,103
Waverly Dance Studio,
3737 Waverly Street.

53
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:34,312
Got it.

54
00:03:34,479 --> 00:03:38,441
Westwood Academy of Dance,
14001 Pico Boulevard.

55
00:03:39,234 --> 00:03:40,277
What's going on?

56
00:03:40,443 --> 00:03:42,320
I'm mapping out
all the dance studios...

57
00:03:42,487 --> 00:03:44,614
- ... within a five-mile radius.
- Why?

58
00:03:44,823 --> 00:03:48,118
I can't stop thinking about
that girl I met. I have to find her.

59
00:03:48,618 --> 00:03:51,705
Shame you can't let your penis
sniff a piece of her clothing.

60
00:03:51,872 --> 00:03:55,500
Look, I know her name, Mia.
It was written on her coffee cup.

61
00:03:55,667 --> 00:03:56,710
I know she's a dancer.

62
00:03:56,877 --> 00:04:00,005
She was wearing leg-warmer-thingies
and reading a dance magazine.

63
00:04:00,171 --> 00:04:02,799
Reading a dance magazine
doesn't make you a dancer.

64
00:04:02,966 --> 00:04:04,801
Why not? You're a monster boob.

65
00:04:07,637 --> 00:04:09,639
Will you both stay out of my room.

66
00:04:11,391 --> 00:04:14,144
Tell me, why do you want to
go to all this trouble...

67
00:04:14,311 --> 00:04:17,355
to track down a girl who showed
less than no interest in you?

68
00:04:17,856 --> 00:04:20,859
A girl who seemed actually repulsed
by your very being.

69
00:04:21,026 --> 00:04:24,946
A girl whose skin visibly crawled
at your mere proximity.

70
00:04:25,155 --> 00:04:27,240
Yeah, but did you see her butt?

71
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:30,994
It was like a ripe little peach.

72
00:04:31,953 --> 00:04:34,873
That's your answer?
Her ass reminded you of fruit?

73
00:04:35,665 --> 00:04:37,334
Berta, explain it to him.

74
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:40,587
A lot of the times a peach
will have a subtle cleft in it...

75
00:04:40,754 --> 00:04:43,381
- ... that is reminiscent of a woman's—
- No. Thanks.

76
00:04:43,548 --> 00:04:45,508
Thanks, I got the picture.

77
00:04:45,675 --> 00:04:49,346
Alan, do you know why Sir Edmund
Hillary wanted to scale Mount Everest?

78
00:04:50,347 --> 00:04:53,308
Because it reminded him
of a big pointy melon?

79
00:04:53,850 --> 00:04:56,936
That's part of the reason,
but the main reason was...

80
00:04:57,103 --> 00:05:00,231
he wanted to do it because
everyone thought it was impossible.

81
00:05:00,774 --> 00:05:02,400
I'm missing the connection here.

82
00:05:02,567 --> 00:05:04,569
If a girl like Mia were easy to climb...

83
00:05:04,778 --> 00:05:06,946
her head would be
covered with flags.

84
00:05:07,572 --> 00:05:09,699
- So you're looking for a challenge.
- Exactly.

85
00:05:09,866 --> 00:05:12,702
No one takes a picture of the fish
that jumps on your boat.

86
00:05:13,244 --> 00:05:16,081
I— I'm confused.
Is she a mountain or a fish?

87
00:05:16,247 --> 00:05:18,708
Doesn't matter,
either way I'm gonna scale her.

88
00:05:22,253 --> 00:05:24,297
And you,
why do you enable this behavior?

89
00:05:24,839 --> 00:05:27,550
Why? I'll tell you why.

90
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:31,429
Because your brother is the embodiment
of the roll-up-your-sleeves spirit...

91
00:05:31,596 --> 00:05:33,139
that made this country great.

92
00:05:33,306 --> 00:05:36,059
He never gets discouraged,
he goes after what he wants...

93
00:05:36,226 --> 00:05:38,228
and he doesn't know
the meaning of quit.

94
00:05:38,395 --> 00:05:41,648
If the day should come when any man,
no matter how humble...

95
00:05:41,815 --> 00:05:45,151
can't go out there and soil the loins
of some hot little dancer...

96
00:05:45,318 --> 00:05:48,321
well, I don't wanna live
in that America.

97
00:06:01,417 --> 00:06:03,962
Okay, very good. Now reverse.

98
00:06:08,842 --> 00:06:10,468
Oh, leave me alone.

99
00:06:10,677 --> 00:06:11,803
Keep going.

100
00:06:11,970 --> 00:06:13,346
Hey, you're a teacher.

101
00:06:13,555 --> 00:06:15,265
Hey, you're a stalker.

102
00:06:15,473 --> 00:06:18,560
No, no. I was passing by
and happened to look in the window.

103
00:06:18,726 --> 00:06:19,853
What's the map for?

104
00:06:20,395 --> 00:06:22,897
Oh, this? I had to go to
eight other dance studios...

105
00:06:23,064 --> 00:06:25,108
before I found the right window.

106
00:06:26,568 --> 00:06:29,070
I suppose that could be
interpreted as stalking...

107
00:06:29,237 --> 00:06:32,991
but it could be just as easily be seen
as sincerity, persistence—

108
00:06:33,158 --> 00:06:34,909
Mental illness?

109
00:06:35,451 --> 00:06:37,829
Come on, I'm clearly smitten.
Throw me a bone.

110
00:06:38,037 --> 00:06:40,331
- Charlie—
- You remembered my name.

111
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:43,710
I wrote it down
in case I needed to call the cops.

112
00:06:43,918 --> 00:06:47,922
I don't have time for dating right now.
I'm completely focused on my work.

113
00:06:48,089 --> 00:06:51,342
Well, let's talk about work.
I've always wanted to learn to dance...

114
00:06:51,509 --> 00:06:54,304
- ... can you teach me?
- I only teach children.

115
00:06:54,470 --> 00:06:57,849
You don't have a class full of
large, slow kids I could be part of?

116
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:03,396
All right, how about this.

117
00:07:03,563 --> 00:07:04,856
My nephew loves to dance.

118
00:07:05,023 --> 00:07:08,401
A gifted little boy.
Moves like a gazelle.

119
00:07:08,943 --> 00:07:11,613
- How old is he?
- I don't know, 1 1, 1 2.

120
00:07:11,779 --> 00:07:14,032
It's hard to say, he's got a big head.

121
00:07:14,741 --> 00:07:16,826
Frankly I'd love to have
a boy in the class.

122
00:07:16,993 --> 00:07:19,078
It's hard to get males
excited about ballet.

123
00:07:19,287 --> 00:07:23,666
Jake is just ballet this and ballet that.

124
00:07:24,709 --> 00:07:26,127
Yeah, I'm sure.

125
00:07:27,045 --> 00:07:28,796
Why don't you bring him
by tomorrow?

126
00:07:29,339 --> 00:07:32,592
- Great. Maybe afterwards you and l—
- Charlie, listen carefully.

127
00:07:32,759 --> 00:07:35,678
You and l, never gonna happen.

128
00:07:36,304 --> 00:07:38,264
Understood. See you tomorrow.

129
00:07:42,352 --> 00:07:45,271
Charlie to base camp,
I am beginning my ascent.

130
00:07:50,818 --> 00:07:54,405
How you liking the pizza your old
Uncle Charlie bought for his buddy?

131
00:07:54,572 --> 00:07:55,615
It's good.

132
00:07:55,823 --> 00:07:58,993
Save room, I've got a half-gallon of that
fudge brownie ice cream.

133
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:00,912
I don't know, I'm pretty stuffed.

134
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:04,624
- You sure?
- Maybe after I poop.

135
00:08:05,875 --> 00:08:06,918
What are you doing?

136
00:08:07,543 --> 00:08:10,129
- We're eating dinner.
- He had dinner an hour ago.

137
00:08:10,338 --> 00:08:13,633
- Well, then he won't need breakfast.
- Yes, I will.

138
00:08:15,009 --> 00:08:17,303
You've had enough to eat.

139
00:08:17,553 --> 00:08:20,390
Hey, Jake, you know what I like to do
after a nice big meal?

140
00:08:20,598 --> 00:08:22,392
- What?
- Learn to dance.

141
00:08:26,187 --> 00:08:27,230
- Charlie.
- Yeah?

142
00:08:27,397 --> 00:08:29,107
Private word.

143
00:08:29,482 --> 00:08:31,025
Sure.

144
00:08:34,487 --> 00:08:36,239
- What's up?
- Shame on you.

145
00:08:36,989 --> 00:08:38,074
Is that it?

146
00:08:38,616 --> 00:08:39,659
You found that girl...

147
00:08:39,826 --> 00:08:42,453
and now you have a plan
to use my son as bait.

148
00:08:42,662 --> 00:08:46,290
Yeah, so? It's not like he pays rent.
Why shouldn't he pitch in a little?

149
00:08:47,083 --> 00:08:48,126
I will not allow it.

150
00:08:48,626 --> 00:08:50,878
Come on, it's just a couple
of ballet lessons.

151
00:08:51,087 --> 00:08:53,005
Ballet? Him?

152
00:08:53,548 --> 00:08:56,259
I think he has a quiet grace about him.

153
00:08:58,177 --> 00:09:00,680
He doesn't have to be good,
he just has to show up.

154
00:09:00,847 --> 00:09:02,265
One lesson, I'm begging you.

155
00:09:02,432 --> 00:09:04,851
You know what,
it really doesn't matter what I say.

156
00:09:05,017 --> 00:09:07,103
You will never convince him
to take ballet.

157
00:09:07,311 --> 00:09:09,188
If I can, will you stay out of it?

158
00:09:09,397 --> 00:09:10,982
- I guess.
- Great.

159
00:09:11,149 --> 00:09:12,733
Hey, Jake.

160
00:09:13,943 --> 00:09:16,821
Okay, that might have been
bad parenting on my part.

161
00:09:17,405 --> 00:09:18,781
I've got a surprise for you.

162
00:09:19,615 --> 00:09:20,908
It's not more food, is it?

163
00:09:21,075 --> 00:09:23,578
Because I'm starting to feel
a little dizzy.

164
00:09:23,786 --> 00:09:27,331
You're gonna get to do something
that no other boy in your class has done.

165
00:09:27,498 --> 00:09:31,294
If it's sex, Mitchell Fineman
already saw his cousin naked.

166
00:09:31,502 --> 00:09:33,588
- No, this is better than sex.
- What?

167
00:09:34,172 --> 00:09:35,965
How would he know?

168
00:09:36,716 --> 00:09:40,178
- You're gonna learn to dance ballet.
- Wanna bet?

169
00:09:43,139 --> 00:09:45,141
Okay, let me put it this way.

170
00:09:45,683 --> 00:09:49,270
How much money would I have to give
you to take ballet lessons?

171
00:09:49,604 --> 00:09:52,565
- I want $10.
- Wait, hold on.

172
00:09:58,529 --> 00:10:00,239
I want $1000.

173
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:05,453
That's really unethical.

174
00:10:05,661 --> 00:10:08,497
Oh, yeah, I'm the one
on shaky moral ground.

175
00:10:10,207 --> 00:10:13,502
- Okay, I'll give you $500.
- Split the difference.

176
00:10:13,711 --> 00:10:15,421
- Two-fifty.
- Done.

177
00:10:26,474 --> 00:10:27,975
Come on, let's go.

178
00:10:28,142 --> 00:10:29,644
I changed my mind.

179
00:10:29,810 --> 00:10:31,938
You took my money.

180
00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:34,315
I'll give it back.

181
00:10:34,482 --> 00:10:36,776
Jake, we're here.
You may as well give it a try.

182
00:10:36,943 --> 00:10:40,613
Yeah, give it a try.
Who knows, you might like it.

183
00:10:47,912 --> 00:10:50,456
I will never forgive you for this.

184
00:10:59,256 --> 00:11:01,592
You didn't tell me
I'd be the only boy here.

185
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:04,094
So? The odds are on your side.

186
00:11:04,636 --> 00:11:07,306
The odds for what? I'm 11.

187
00:11:08,432 --> 00:11:10,893
- I wanna go home.
- I thought we had a deal.

188
00:11:11,101 --> 00:11:13,270
You can't make him stay
if he doesn't want to.

189
00:11:13,478 --> 00:11:15,647
I love you, Dad.

190
00:11:17,649 --> 00:11:19,026
All right, let's get started.

191
00:11:19,943 --> 00:11:22,237
- Who's that?
- Your teacher.

192
00:11:22,779 --> 00:11:24,531
- Come on, let's go.
- Hang on, Dad.

193
00:11:24,698 --> 00:11:26,658
Maybe we should give this a chance.

194
00:11:28,202 --> 00:11:29,328
Hi, I'm Jake.

195
00:11:29,870 --> 00:11:33,665
- Hi, Jake. It's nice to meet you.
- Yeah.

196
00:11:34,458 --> 00:11:38,337
- Your uncle tells me you like ballet.
- Yeah.

197
00:11:39,296 --> 00:11:41,423
Okay. How about you
line up with the girls...

198
00:11:41,590 --> 00:11:43,967
- ... and we'll get started.
- Yeah.

199
00:11:44,551 --> 00:11:46,011
How about that?

200
00:11:46,178 --> 00:11:48,138
He's got a crush.

201
00:11:48,305 --> 00:11:50,474
It's like watching a dog chase a car.

202
00:11:50,641 --> 00:11:54,478
He'll never catch it, and even if he did,
he couldn't drive it.

203
00:11:55,771 --> 00:11:58,357
He's still doing better than you.

204
00:11:59,983 --> 00:12:02,569
Everyone, I'd like you to meet
our new student Jake.

205
00:12:02,736 --> 00:12:06,281
- Hi, Jake.
- Yeah, hi.

206
00:12:07,532 --> 00:12:11,203
Okay, let's start in first position.
Jake, do you know first position?

207
00:12:11,745 --> 00:12:14,164
Is that like the missionary position?

208
00:12:18,752 --> 00:12:21,421
And one, and two...

209
00:12:21,588 --> 00:12:25,133
and three, and four.

210
00:12:28,762 --> 00:12:31,223
I will never forgive you for this.

211
00:12:31,390 --> 00:12:33,850
What? He's having a great time.

212
00:12:34,017 --> 00:12:36,353
The clueless knucklehead.

213
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:39,147
Okay, very nice, class.

214
00:12:39,356 --> 00:12:41,525
Yeah, good hustle, everybody.

215
00:12:42,317 --> 00:12:43,402
Much better, Jake.

216
00:12:43,944 --> 00:12:47,114
- That's because I have a good teacher.
- Thank you.

217
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:48,949
All right, that's it for this week.

218
00:12:49,116 --> 00:12:51,368
Remember, life is a dance,
live it gracefully.

219
00:12:51,576 --> 00:12:52,953
That's my motto.

220
00:12:58,625 --> 00:12:59,918
Well, that settles it.

221
00:13:00,085 --> 00:13:02,212
I wanna be a ballet dancer
when I grow up.

222
00:13:02,754 --> 00:13:05,424
Really? There's a load off my mind.

223
00:13:05,632 --> 00:13:08,135
It's not as easy as it looks.
It's pretty hard.

224
00:13:08,343 --> 00:13:10,470
Yeah. It's pretty hard to watch.

225
00:13:11,430 --> 00:13:13,056
Thanks.

226
00:13:13,849 --> 00:13:16,977
Did you see how far Mia
could put her leg over her head?

227
00:13:17,144 --> 00:13:19,521
I did notice that, yes.

228
00:13:20,230 --> 00:13:23,734
So, what do you think,
Fred Astaire or Fred Flintstone?

229
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:26,820
- He's got a lot of enthusiasm.
- He gets that from me.

230
00:13:27,028 --> 00:13:28,405
I thought you were his uncle.

231
00:13:28,572 --> 00:13:31,241
That's the whole
nature and nurture debate, isn't it?

232
00:13:31,408 --> 00:13:33,785
- So listen, Mia—
- I'm not going out with you.

233
00:13:34,327 --> 00:13:36,121
I know, you made it very clear.

234
00:13:36,288 --> 00:13:39,416
My question was is there anything more
we can do to help Jake?

235
00:13:39,583 --> 00:13:41,585
Extra classes? Private tutoring?

236
00:13:41,751 --> 00:13:44,212
The three of us in Cabo
for a long weekend?

237
00:13:45,505 --> 00:13:49,259
If he comes to class regularly,
I think you'll be amazed at his progress.

238
00:13:49,468 --> 00:13:51,845
Good, I'd hate to think he's peaked.

239
00:13:52,053 --> 00:13:53,805
We're having a recital next month...

240
00:13:53,972 --> 00:13:57,058
and with a lot of work and
a little luck, we can include him.

241
00:13:59,728 --> 00:14:01,271
Charlie to base camp...

242
00:14:01,438 --> 00:14:04,232
pretty cold up here, visibility zero.

243
00:16:06,521 --> 00:16:07,564
Call me.

244
00:16:09,399 --> 00:16:10,734
Okay.

245
00:16:21,995 --> 00:16:23,246
I hope you like this.

246
00:16:23,413 --> 00:16:26,541
It's an impertinent little cabernet
with oaky overtones...

247
00:16:26,708 --> 00:16:29,043
and just the hint of a floral finish.

248
00:16:29,586 --> 00:16:33,506
- Wow, you really know your wines.
- I just read it off the box.

249
00:16:34,799 --> 00:16:37,469
What's the plan? Get me drunk
and take advantage of me?

250
00:16:37,677 --> 00:16:39,637
Oh, good, you've done this before.

251
00:16:44,851 --> 00:16:46,519
I had a very nice time tonight.

252
00:16:47,103 --> 00:16:49,606
Was it worth all the trouble
I put you through?

253
00:16:50,273 --> 00:16:51,483
You tell me.

254
00:16:52,025 --> 00:16:53,818
Ask me again in the morning.

255
00:16:56,070 --> 00:16:57,238
Charlie to base camp.

256
00:16:57,405 --> 00:16:59,365
I can see the summit.

257
00:17:03,495 --> 00:17:06,372
- Hey.
- Hey, Jake.

258
00:17:06,623 --> 00:17:09,417
- What are you doing up?
- Why shouldn't I be up?

259
00:17:09,959 --> 00:17:11,503
Isn't it past your bedtime?

260
00:17:12,045 --> 00:17:13,922
I don't know
what you're talking about.

261
00:17:14,088 --> 00:17:17,634
- I don't have a bedtime.
- Okay.

262
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:19,511
- So, what's going on?
- Not too much.

263
00:17:20,303 --> 00:17:21,346
Where's your dad?

264
00:17:21,888 --> 00:17:24,641
I don't know,
why don't you go look for him?

265
00:17:26,518 --> 00:17:28,853
Look, Jake, Mia and l
are kind of busy right now.

266
00:17:29,521 --> 00:17:31,439
- Busy doing what?
- Talking.

267
00:17:31,981 --> 00:17:35,235
Okay. What are we talking about?

268
00:17:35,610 --> 00:17:38,363
We are not talking about anything.
You're going to bed.

269
00:17:38,530 --> 00:17:40,573
Why don't we let Mia decide?

270
00:17:41,282 --> 00:17:43,326
Jake, I think you should go to bed.

271
00:17:43,535 --> 00:17:46,496
Are you sure?
You don't have to decide right now.

272
00:17:47,288 --> 00:17:50,625
Your uncle and I would like to spend
some alone-time together.

273
00:17:53,086 --> 00:17:54,128
All right.

274
00:17:55,338 --> 00:17:56,965
You want me to tuck you in?

275
00:17:57,507 --> 00:18:01,302
I'm too old to get tucked in, you—
You ass-face.

276
00:18:02,887 --> 00:18:06,516
Okay, then, sleep tight, little camper.

277
00:18:09,894 --> 00:18:11,229
Kids, huh?

278
00:18:11,396 --> 00:18:13,523
Yeah, kids.

279
00:18:14,232 --> 00:18:17,110
He never called me
an ass-face before.

280
00:18:17,652 --> 00:18:20,989
- I think he's a little jealous.
- Yeah.

281
00:18:21,906 --> 00:18:23,408
I remember feeling like that...

282
00:18:23,574 --> 00:18:25,076
- ... when I was his age.
- Really?

283
00:18:26,452 --> 00:18:27,662
Cafeteria lady.

284
00:18:28,997 --> 00:18:30,873
Looked like Valerie Bertinelli...

285
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:35,378
but, you know, with a hairnet and
just the cutest whisper of a mustache.

286
00:18:36,963 --> 00:18:38,756
She didn't know I was alive.

287
00:18:38,923 --> 00:18:40,258
You poor thing.

288
00:18:42,010 --> 00:18:44,470
I'm sorry, Mia. I can't—
I can't do this to him.

289
00:18:45,013 --> 00:18:46,347
Do what to him?

290
00:18:46,889 --> 00:18:49,517
One afternoon I saw the cafeteria lady
holding hands...

291
00:18:49,684 --> 00:18:51,853
with the shop teacher
in the parking lot...

292
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:53,855
and it just killed me.

293
00:18:54,022 --> 00:18:57,233
Mr. Dinapoli. I'll never forget it.

294
00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:00,361
She was holding the hand
with the missing thumb.

295
00:19:03,364 --> 00:19:06,159
You know what,
I've gotta take you home.

296
00:19:06,325 --> 00:19:07,952
- I understand.
- You do?

297
00:19:08,161 --> 00:19:09,579
You love Jake.

298
00:19:09,746 --> 00:19:13,082
You'd rather give up spending the night
with me than risk hurting him.

299
00:19:13,291 --> 00:19:14,751
Right.

300
00:19:15,126 --> 00:19:18,671
Although when you spell it out like that,
it sounds incredibly stupid.

301
00:19:19,756 --> 00:19:21,299
You're a very sweet man.

302
00:19:21,507 --> 00:19:22,633
Thank you.

303
00:19:31,267 --> 00:19:32,894
I was kidding. Let's go upstairs.

304
00:19:33,603 --> 00:19:35,897
Charlie, take me home.

305
00:19:36,439 --> 00:19:39,317
Let's talk about this.
He's 11, he'll get over it.

306
00:19:39,484 --> 00:19:42,195
I got over one-thumb Dinapoli.

307
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:52,162
You asleep?

308
00:19:55,374 --> 00:19:58,961
- You can quit faking, I took her home.
- Really?

309
00:20:00,337 --> 00:20:02,131
- Yeah.
- How come?

310
00:20:02,673 --> 00:20:04,591
It's part of the guy code.

311
00:20:04,758 --> 00:20:08,429
When two friends like the same girl,
one of them has to step aside.

312
00:20:09,722 --> 00:20:13,434
Unless she's a good sport, then it's
like Saturday morning at the bakery.

313
00:20:14,768 --> 00:20:16,520
It's a complicated code.

314
00:20:17,771 --> 00:20:18,897
Don't worry about it.

315
00:20:19,064 --> 00:20:21,233
Bottom line is,
I'm out of the Mia business.

316
00:20:21,442 --> 00:20:22,526
Cool.

317
00:20:23,110 --> 00:20:24,945
Now, go to sleep.

318
00:20:26,572 --> 00:20:28,532
- Uncle Charlie?
- Yeah?

319
00:20:29,074 --> 00:20:31,577
I'm sorry I called you an ass-face.

320
00:20:33,370 --> 00:20:34,872
Oh, yeah.

321
00:20:35,456 --> 00:20:36,498
I forgot about that.

322
00:21:17,122 --> 00:21:18,791
No woman is worth this.

323
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:23,879
I am so proud.

324
00:21:24,046 --> 00:21:26,423
Our little boy is growing up.
