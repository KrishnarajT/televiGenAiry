1
00:00:03,467 --> 00:00:05,386
Hello?

2
00:00:09,015 --> 00:00:10,766
Anybody?

3
00:00:12,893 --> 00:00:14,895
Big news.

4
00:00:15,813 --> 00:00:17,898
I'm gonna marry Mia.

5
00:00:18,733 --> 00:00:19,942
Hey, Alan.

6
00:00:20,109 --> 00:00:21,944
I'm in the shower.

7
00:00:22,153 --> 00:00:23,738
Guess what I'm gonna do
with Mia.

8
00:00:24,697 --> 00:00:27,033
Guess what I'm already doing
with Kandi.

9
00:00:28,576 --> 00:00:29,827
That's not fair, Alan.

10
00:00:29,994 --> 00:00:31,537
You have to give him a hint.

11
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:33,539
He doesn't need a hint.

12
00:00:33,748 --> 00:00:35,958
Well, then how's he supposed
to guess?

13
00:00:38,794 --> 00:00:40,046
Oh, well.

14
00:00:41,964 --> 00:00:45,676
Look, a place to hang my washcloth.

15
00:00:53,267 --> 00:00:55,352
The rule of thumb
with an engagement ring...

16
00:00:55,519 --> 00:00:58,314
is that the price should equal
three months' salary.

17
00:00:59,982 --> 00:01:01,942
I wonder what broad
came up with that.

18
00:01:03,152 --> 00:01:07,156
It's a marketing scheme dreamed up
by the international diamond cartel.

19
00:01:07,323 --> 00:01:09,116
Probably a bunch of chicks.

20
00:01:11,327 --> 00:01:12,995
But at least diamonds are forever.

21
00:01:13,537 --> 00:01:16,415
Oh, yeah, forever.
My ex-wife still has hers.

22
00:01:16,624 --> 00:01:20,377
Meanwhile, I'm wearing mismatched
socks from the irregular bin.

23
00:01:20,878 --> 00:01:22,880
Well, Mia and I are gonna go
the distance.

24
00:01:23,047 --> 00:01:24,590
Fifteen, maybe 20 years.

25
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:26,550
That's not the distance.

26
00:01:26,717 --> 00:01:28,552
The distance is death.

27
00:01:29,512 --> 00:01:31,722
If I'm still married
after 20 years, kill me.

28
00:01:33,265 --> 00:01:36,102
- I can't believe you're doing this at all.
- Why not?

29
00:01:36,268 --> 00:01:39,396
Why shouldn't someone like me
settle down with a wife and kids?

30
00:01:39,563 --> 00:01:41,524
Boy, I don't know where to start.

31
00:01:41,982 --> 00:01:44,026
That's the old Charlie
you're thinking of.

32
00:01:44,193 --> 00:01:45,402
Oh, okay.

33
00:01:45,569 --> 00:01:48,531
And to whom am I speaking now?

34
00:01:48,739 --> 00:01:51,867
- May I help you gentlemen?
- We're looking for an engagement ring.

35
00:01:52,034 --> 00:01:53,410
How nice.

36
00:01:54,995 --> 00:01:56,413
Do you have anything in mind?

37
00:02:00,292 --> 00:02:01,669
Nothing ostentatious.

38
00:02:01,836 --> 00:02:05,339
Something in a brilliant cut,
perhaps with complementary baguettes.

39
00:02:05,506 --> 00:02:08,008
Size isn't as important
as color and clarity.

40
00:02:08,425 --> 00:02:10,427
Well, someone knows what he wants.

41
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:14,932
What can I say?

42
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:17,059
He's my life.

43
00:02:22,481 --> 00:02:25,734
So basically I asked her to marry me
and she said yes.

44
00:02:29,905 --> 00:02:32,324
- What do you think about that, Jake?
- Good.

45
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,410
That's it? Good?

46
00:02:34,994 --> 00:02:36,036
It's not good?

47
00:02:36,495 --> 00:02:37,538
No, it's good.

48
00:02:38,038 --> 00:02:39,498
That's what I said.

49
00:02:41,292 --> 00:02:42,334
All right, I'm full.

50
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:47,214
Wears his little heart on his sleeve,
doesn't he?

51
00:02:47,381 --> 00:02:48,757
It's my own fault.

52
00:02:48,924 --> 00:02:52,636
I should've known better
than to talk to him at feeding time.

53
00:02:54,305 --> 00:02:56,140
Charlie, I need to speak to you.

54
00:02:56,974 --> 00:02:58,726
I'll be right out, Rose.

55
00:03:01,061 --> 00:03:02,896
- Did you tell her?
- Of course not.

56
00:03:03,063 --> 00:03:04,315
- Would you?
- No.

57
00:03:04,481 --> 00:03:06,942
- I'll let you be my best man.
- You mean I'm not?

58
00:03:07,443 --> 00:03:10,112
Well, you're on the short list
but this could cinch it.

59
00:03:10,779 --> 00:03:13,490
Come on, that woman has been
obsessed with you for years.

60
00:03:13,657 --> 00:03:16,619
She's gonna find out sooner or later.
Let it come from you.

61
00:03:18,287 --> 00:03:19,455
Yeah, I guess.

62
00:03:19,622 --> 00:03:21,957
She has a boyfriend now.
She probably won't care.

63
00:03:22,124 --> 00:03:24,209
- Probably not.
- So why won't you tell her?

64
00:03:24,418 --> 00:03:27,671
Because if I want my eyebrows shaved,
I'll shave them myself.

65
00:03:31,467 --> 00:03:33,927
Hey, Rosey Rose.

66
00:03:34,303 --> 00:03:36,138
What's up, Rosey Rose?

67
00:03:36,347 --> 00:03:37,848
Gordon dumped me.

68
00:03:38,057 --> 00:03:40,184
Oh, damn it to hell.

69
00:03:41,185 --> 00:03:43,979
I know, it's awful.

70
00:03:44,396 --> 00:03:45,981
How could he do this?

71
00:03:46,148 --> 00:03:49,693
He couldn't be with me anymore
knowing that I'm still in love with you.

72
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:52,863
Oh, no, no, no.

73
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:54,239
Yes, yes, yes...

74
00:03:54,406 --> 00:03:56,325
yes, yes.

75
00:03:57,409 --> 00:03:59,203
Listen, Rose.

76
00:03:59,828 --> 00:04:02,498
- There's something I have to tell you.
- ls it good news?

77
00:04:02,664 --> 00:04:04,041
I could use some good news.

78
00:04:05,667 --> 00:04:07,503
Well...

79
00:04:08,712 --> 00:04:11,548
- ... you remember Mia?
- Yeah.

80
00:04:12,549 --> 00:04:14,426
Don't tell me you're dating her again.

81
00:04:14,593 --> 00:04:16,178
No, no. No, we are not dating.

82
00:04:16,345 --> 00:04:19,264
Good. Because I always thought
she was kind of a head case.

83
00:04:21,934 --> 00:04:23,644
Yeah.

84
00:04:23,811 --> 00:04:28,941
Look, the thing is, I'm gonna,
kind of, marry her.

85
00:04:33,695 --> 00:04:35,197
Rose?

86
00:04:36,365 --> 00:04:38,867
- Did you hear me?
- I heard you.

87
00:04:39,034 --> 00:04:40,327
You're gonna marry Mia.

88
00:04:42,538 --> 00:04:43,580
So are you okay?

89
00:04:43,914 --> 00:04:45,040
Sure.

90
00:04:45,207 --> 00:04:46,416
Why wouldn't I be okay?

91
00:04:47,209 --> 00:04:51,380
Well, I was afraid the news might come
as a bit of a shock to you.

92
00:04:51,588 --> 00:04:52,673
Afraid?

93
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:55,008
There's nothing to be afraid of, Charlie.

94
00:04:55,175 --> 00:04:57,219
You're my friend.

95
00:05:00,848 --> 00:05:02,599
Where are you going?

96
00:05:02,766 --> 00:05:03,892
I have things to do.

97
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:06,854
- What kind of things?
- Things.

98
00:05:08,647 --> 00:05:09,982
Goodbye, Charlie.

99
00:05:12,901 --> 00:05:14,152
Hello, Alan.

100
00:05:14,319 --> 00:05:16,029
Hello.

101
00:05:21,410 --> 00:05:23,871
Did she just use the front door?

102
00:05:26,039 --> 00:05:28,458
She's never used
the front door before.

103
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:32,588
What happened out there?

104
00:05:32,754 --> 00:05:34,965
Well, I told her
I was gonna marry Mia...

105
00:05:35,132 --> 00:05:39,303
and I think I could actually see
her medication stop working.

106
00:05:42,389 --> 00:05:47,227
- What do you think she's gonna do?
- The question isn't what, it's when.

107
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:53,233
And how I'm gonna enjoy my honeymoon
with my testicles glued to my ass-crack.

108
00:05:57,571 --> 00:06:00,032
- That's a pretty wedding gown.
- Oh, yeah.

109
00:06:00,198 --> 00:06:02,534
I could crawl under there
during the reception...

110
00:06:02,701 --> 00:06:04,911
and no one would have a clue.

111
00:06:05,704 --> 00:06:07,956
Well, you would.

112
00:06:08,332 --> 00:06:09,750
Stop.

113
00:06:09,958 --> 00:06:12,377
I don't think you'd say that.

114
00:06:12,794 --> 00:06:14,379
Isn't it beautiful?

115
00:06:14,546 --> 00:06:18,008
They say you're supposed to spend
three months' salary but I went four.

116
00:06:18,175 --> 00:06:21,345
- Because I'm worth it?
- No, actually I had a slow first quarter.

117
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:26,433
My dad called today. He wants to
take your family out for dinner.

118
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:30,354
Y eah, well, tell him he can have one
or the other but not both.

119
00:06:30,562 --> 00:06:33,231
Come on, they're gonna have to
meet sooner or later.

120
00:06:33,398 --> 00:06:36,485
Okay, but why don't we wait
for a real happy occasion?

121
00:06:36,652 --> 00:06:41,281
- What's happier than a wedding?
- My mother's funeral springs to mind.

122
00:06:41,782 --> 00:06:45,202
There'll be music, dancing,
my mom will be in a box.

123
00:06:46,244 --> 00:06:48,121
You're horrible.

124
00:06:48,288 --> 00:06:49,790
That's a gorgeous wedding cake.

125
00:06:49,956 --> 00:06:50,999
It's okay.

126
00:06:51,166 --> 00:06:53,919
I'm not big on having
the little action figures on top.

127
00:06:54,086 --> 00:06:56,421
- They kind of creep me out.
- They're traditional.

128
00:06:56,588 --> 00:06:59,424
Hey, this is our wedding,
we can do whatever we want.

129
00:06:59,591 --> 00:07:03,053
We don't even have to have cake,
we could have pie.

130
00:07:03,678 --> 00:07:05,764
A wedding pie?

131
00:07:06,348 --> 00:07:08,266
Well, we'd probably need
more than one.

132
00:07:08,433 --> 00:07:10,769
You know, so everybody gets
some crust.

133
00:07:12,145 --> 00:07:15,357
Alan, what do you think
about a wedding with no cake?

134
00:07:15,524 --> 00:07:18,276
No cake? Where would you put
the little bride and groom?

135
00:07:18,985 --> 00:07:21,029
I can think of one place.

136
00:07:22,906 --> 00:07:25,784
- lf you do a wedding, do it right.
- Thank you, Alan.

137
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:28,954
You're welcome. Which reminds me,
I found my wedding folder.

138
00:07:29,121 --> 00:07:32,707
- Guess what was in it?
- The claim check for your manhood?

139
00:07:34,418 --> 00:07:35,460
As I was saying...

140
00:07:35,627 --> 00:07:39,089
it's all here. Everything you could
possibly need for your big day.

141
00:07:39,256 --> 00:07:41,091
From paper samples
for your announcements...

142
00:07:41,258 --> 00:07:44,427
to selected verses of poetry
well-suited for wedding vows.

143
00:07:44,594 --> 00:07:47,806
And you wonder why people
think you're gay.

144
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:50,058
Oh, shush.

145
00:07:50,225 --> 00:07:53,353
Now, you're talking cake
but we are light years away from cake.

146
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:56,940
First we have to discuss the budget,
the venue, how many guests.

147
00:07:57,107 --> 00:07:59,276
Is it gonna be a sit-down dinner
or a buffet.

148
00:07:59,442 --> 00:08:03,155
Then you need to hire a photographer
and a videographer. Then a florist.

149
00:08:03,363 --> 00:08:04,865
Have you thought about flowers?

150
00:08:05,532 --> 00:08:06,992
Well, lilies are nice.

151
00:08:07,159 --> 00:08:10,370
Lilies are perfect if the bride and groom
are recently deceased.

152
00:08:14,583 --> 00:08:15,959
But I like lilies.

153
00:08:16,376 --> 00:08:19,421
Mia, we'll never get through this
if you don't focus.

154
00:08:19,713 --> 00:08:21,715
Now, wedding party.

155
00:08:21,882 --> 00:08:23,800
Bridesmaids. What are they wearing?

156
00:08:23,967 --> 00:08:26,595
I suggest an unflattering style
in a hideous color...

157
00:08:26,761 --> 00:08:29,764
because after all, this is your day.

158
00:08:29,931 --> 00:08:33,768
Oh, and before I forget, although
it's not politically correct to throw rice...

159
00:08:33,935 --> 00:08:37,731
if you throw birdseed, you run the risk
of ending like a Hitchcock movie.

160
00:08:41,192 --> 00:08:43,153
What kind of pie
did you have in mind?

161
00:08:43,528 --> 00:08:47,324
Well, look who's here.
The bride of Drunkenstein.

162
00:08:47,532 --> 00:08:48,575
Look.

163
00:08:49,117 --> 00:08:51,369
Wow, that's quite a rock.

164
00:08:52,621 --> 00:08:55,916
You know what we call babes
with rings like that in my neighborhood?

165
00:08:56,082 --> 00:08:58,001
Stumpy.

166
00:09:00,086 --> 00:09:03,423
What are you looking at me for?
Just stay out of her neighborhood.

167
00:09:07,677 --> 00:09:09,930
That was uncomfortable.

168
00:09:10,096 --> 00:09:13,600
No, sand in my urethra
is uncomfortable.

169
00:09:13,767 --> 00:09:16,728
That meal was a freaking disaster.

170
00:09:19,147 --> 00:09:21,983
I'm gonna stay with my family,
try and calm my mother down.

171
00:09:22,525 --> 00:09:24,653
The miserable bitch.

172
00:09:25,111 --> 00:09:28,490
- Your family hates me, don't they?
- Not just you.

173
00:09:29,324 --> 00:09:31,284
I'll call you later.

174
00:09:34,996 --> 00:09:37,290
Do you believe your
future mother-in-law?

175
00:09:37,457 --> 00:09:40,251
Shows up at a four-star restaurant
wearing a tracksuit...

176
00:09:40,418 --> 00:09:44,339
with the word "juicy" stretched across
her half-acre ass.

177
00:09:44,506 --> 00:09:46,716
I can read, Mom.

178
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:49,552
Can we go back?
I forgot my doggy bag.

179
00:09:49,719 --> 00:09:52,180
We can never go back, Jake.

180
00:09:52,806 --> 00:09:54,641
Come on, it's not the end
of the world.

181
00:09:54,808 --> 00:09:58,311
Easy for you to say. You're not marrying
into the Addams family.

182
00:09:59,729 --> 00:10:01,272
Oh, like you were a prize.

183
00:10:01,439 --> 00:10:04,859
Slipping a prenuptial agreement
into my fiancée's menu.

184
00:10:05,318 --> 00:10:07,404
I am just trying to protect you...

185
00:10:07,570 --> 00:10:09,948
from being wiped out
by a vindictive ex-wife...

186
00:10:10,115 --> 00:10:14,828
who will use your hard-earned money
to finance a frivolous life of partying...

187
00:10:14,994 --> 00:10:17,705
and shopping
and unnecessary plastic surgery.

188
00:10:18,832 --> 00:10:20,875
- Mom—
- Every one of my surgeries...

189
00:10:21,042 --> 00:10:23,044
was necessary.

190
00:10:23,211 --> 00:10:25,004
And if I had signed a pre-nup...

191
00:10:25,171 --> 00:10:27,382
you would never have gone
to music camp...

192
00:10:27,549 --> 00:10:31,261
and Alan would have an overbite
you could use to open a can of Pennzoil.

193
00:10:33,263 --> 00:10:36,224
I didn't know Mia's last name
was Addams.

194
00:10:36,724 --> 00:10:38,768
I didn't know her sister is a cop.

195
00:10:38,935 --> 00:10:40,311
Was a cop.

196
00:10:40,478 --> 00:10:44,149
Now she's a dry drunk
with a grudge and a.38.

197
00:10:45,733 --> 00:10:47,652
Well, I liked her.

198
00:10:47,819 --> 00:10:51,406
Well, that's because she had
the same haircut as you.

199
00:10:51,614 --> 00:10:54,826
I was a little shocked that her father
stuck you with the bill.

200
00:10:54,993 --> 00:10:56,453
You know why you noticed that?

201
00:10:56,619 --> 00:10:58,788
Because the two of you
trampled each other...

202
00:10:58,955 --> 00:11:02,375
trying to get to the men's room
when you saw the waiter bringing it.

203
00:11:03,168 --> 00:11:05,795
I drank a lot of iced tea.

204
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,840
Well, I had a very nice time.

205
00:11:09,048 --> 00:11:12,218
Sure, you got to inform my bride-to-be
and her entire family...

206
00:11:12,385 --> 00:11:15,305
that you had sex with me
before you had sex with him.

207
00:11:15,471 --> 00:11:18,975
I was just telling Mia
I know how lucky she is.

208
00:11:19,142 --> 00:11:21,769
Nevertheless, honey,
it was not an appropriate toast.

209
00:11:23,855 --> 00:11:27,150
Juicy-pants almost choked to death
on her lamb shank.

210
00:11:27,609 --> 00:11:32,238
Well, in all fairness, the woman was
stuffing her face like a musket.

211
00:11:32,572 --> 00:11:34,616
All I can say is,
after tonight's fiasco...

212
00:11:34,782 --> 00:11:37,994
I'm gonna have to rethink
the seating chart for the wedding.

213
00:11:38,161 --> 00:11:40,121
Yeah, well, it won't be
that complicated.

214
00:11:40,288 --> 00:11:43,583
- Why not?
- Because none of you are invited.

215
00:11:46,044 --> 00:11:49,714
Well, Mom, if you wear an animal print
tracksuit to a nice restaurant...

216
00:11:49,881 --> 00:11:52,008
people are gonna make comments.

217
00:11:52,425 --> 00:11:53,468
I agree.

218
00:11:53,635 --> 00:11:57,013
Calling you a cougar with arm fat
was over the line.

219
00:11:57,597 --> 00:11:59,265
Hang on.

220
00:12:04,145 --> 00:12:06,314
Hello, Mia.

221
00:12:07,357 --> 00:12:08,399
I'll call you back.

222
00:12:18,743 --> 00:12:21,496
You don't think Mia's gonna turn
into her mother, do you?

223
00:12:21,663 --> 00:12:23,498
I wouldn't worry about it.

224
00:12:23,665 --> 00:12:24,707
Yeah.

225
00:12:24,874 --> 00:12:28,503
What I would worry about
is you turning her into our mother.

226
00:12:29,629 --> 00:12:32,590
Thanks for ruining my wedding night,
Dr. Freud.

227
00:12:32,757 --> 00:12:35,343
Hey, don't set the bar too high
for the wedding night.

228
00:12:35,510 --> 00:12:38,179
- What are you talking about?
- It's a long, stressful day.

229
00:12:38,346 --> 00:12:42,517
You'll be exhausted, full of banquet food
and cheap champagne.

230
00:12:42,684 --> 00:12:43,768
Take my advice.

231
00:12:43,935 --> 00:12:46,270
Tell her you love her,
give her a big kiss...

232
00:12:46,437 --> 00:12:49,941
and try to fall asleep with your ass
pointed toward an open window.

233
00:12:55,571 --> 00:12:57,865
You, sir, have the heart of a poet.

234
00:13:01,244 --> 00:13:05,123
I am merely the voice
of smelly experience.

235
00:13:08,835 --> 00:13:10,712
Well then, let me ask you this.

236
00:13:10,878 --> 00:13:13,381
I know things didn't end well
with you and Judith...

237
00:13:13,548 --> 00:13:16,259
but overall,
did you like being married?

238
00:13:16,426 --> 00:13:17,760
Oh, I loved being married.

239
00:13:17,927 --> 00:13:19,971
Never missed having sex
with other women?

240
00:13:20,138 --> 00:13:22,974
Sure. But I missed that
before I got married too.

241
00:13:24,517 --> 00:13:28,521
What I loved was the idea of having
someone that I could always turn to.

242
00:13:28,688 --> 00:13:30,398
Someone who cared about me.

243
00:13:30,565 --> 00:13:33,734
Someone who'd always stand by me
through thick and thin.

244
00:13:33,901 --> 00:13:34,944
It does sound nice.

245
00:13:35,611 --> 00:13:38,948
Yeah, so does Disneyland.

246
00:13:39,574 --> 00:13:43,828
Yet every day people stagger off
those giant teacups covered in vomit.

247
00:13:47,081 --> 00:13:48,749
But you'd do it again?

248
00:13:48,958 --> 00:13:50,209
What can I say?

249
00:13:50,376 --> 00:13:51,919
Marriage is a great ride...

250
00:13:52,086 --> 00:13:53,129
until you puke.

251
00:13:56,757 --> 00:13:59,760
- Good night.
- Good night.

252
00:14:05,266 --> 00:14:06,934
Charlie.

253
00:14:07,101 --> 00:14:08,686
Mia?

254
00:14:11,731 --> 00:14:13,900
Your friend Rose
was just at my apartment.

255
00:14:17,653 --> 00:14:19,113
So how'd that go?

256
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:22,408
She was wearing a bridal gown.
Planning on wearing it to our wedding.

257
00:14:22,575 --> 00:14:24,911
She wanted me to know
so we wouldn't clash.

258
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:27,663
Well, that's kind of thoughtful, isn't it?

259
00:14:27,830 --> 00:14:30,833
I'm not finished.
She wanted to give me a shower.

260
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:32,585
An engagement shower?

261
00:14:32,752 --> 00:14:35,129
An actual soap and water shower.

262
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:38,925
I don't want her at my wedding.

263
00:14:39,091 --> 00:14:41,302
Hey, I don't want her in my zip code.

264
00:14:41,469 --> 00:14:43,137
But she's a close friend.

265
00:14:43,596 --> 00:14:47,058
- Charlie.
- All right, all right, I'll tell you what...

266
00:14:47,975 --> 00:14:49,936
I'll cross Rose off the guest list...

267
00:14:50,102 --> 00:14:53,773
if you dump that pistol-packing
hermaphrodite you call a sister.

268
00:14:54,482 --> 00:14:55,691
She's my maid of honor...

269
00:14:55,858 --> 00:14:59,153
the gun is registered,
and she's taking hormones.

270
00:15:00,196 --> 00:15:02,323
While we're pruning,
what about your mother?

271
00:15:02,490 --> 00:15:04,450
Done. She's out. Now your mother.

272
00:15:04,617 --> 00:15:07,328
You would've thrown your mother
overboard for free.

273
00:15:07,828 --> 00:15:09,163
I don't care. If she goes...

274
00:15:09,330 --> 00:15:12,208
somebody on your side's gotta go.
How about your father?

275
00:15:12,375 --> 00:15:16,671
He takes us all out to dinner and the only
plastic he's got on him is his shoes.

276
00:15:17,213 --> 00:15:19,465
Charlie, he has to give me away
at the wedding.

277
00:15:19,632 --> 00:15:21,801
Give you away? That cheapskate?

278
00:15:21,968 --> 00:15:25,429
I'll probably have to trade him a pony
and a couple of blankets for you.

279
00:15:26,138 --> 00:15:30,226
We're gonna have a wedding that none
of our family and friends can attend?

280
00:15:30,393 --> 00:15:33,104
Might as well go to Vegas and elope.

281
00:15:38,025 --> 00:15:40,361
Now, there's an interesting concept.

282
00:15:40,528 --> 00:15:43,155
In Vegas, not only
could we get married immediately...

283
00:15:43,322 --> 00:15:46,158
we can get drunk
and gamble away our nest egg.

284
00:15:46,575 --> 00:15:48,703
Don't forget the lap dances
and hookers.

285
00:15:49,203 --> 00:15:52,081
Oh, you're gonna make a great wife.

286
00:16:01,757 --> 00:16:04,927
All the wonderful plans
I had for a wedding.

287
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:07,638
Let it go, Alan.

288
00:16:08,222 --> 00:16:09,890
I don't understand the big rush.

289
00:16:10,057 --> 00:16:12,101
You wouldn't even stop
for boutonnieres.

290
00:16:13,602 --> 00:16:15,688
I just wanna get this over with.

291
00:16:15,855 --> 00:16:16,981
Get this over with?

292
00:16:17,148 --> 00:16:20,693
That's the attitude you take
to a proctologist, not a marriage.

293
00:16:21,068 --> 00:16:22,903
Well, maybe I'm a little nervous.

294
00:16:23,112 --> 00:16:25,072
- ls that all it is?
- What are you saying?

295
00:16:25,239 --> 00:16:29,160
I'm saying that if you're feeling uneasy,
maybe you're not ready for this.

296
00:16:29,326 --> 00:16:31,746
- Did you have doubts when you married?
- None.

297
00:16:31,912 --> 00:16:34,081
Judith assured me
I was doing the right thing.

298
00:16:46,677 --> 00:16:48,554
That's all I got.

299
00:16:51,932 --> 00:16:52,975
Hi.

300
00:16:55,394 --> 00:16:58,189
- You look beautiful.
- Thanks.

301
00:16:58,939 --> 00:17:00,816
I was afraid you were gonna
chicken out.

302
00:17:01,150 --> 00:17:04,236
That's funny, she said the same thing
about you.

303
00:17:05,362 --> 00:17:06,405
Thank you, Kandi.

304
00:17:08,032 --> 00:17:09,992
Are you sure this is
what you wanna do?

305
00:17:10,159 --> 00:17:12,119
I'm sure. Are you?

306
00:17:12,536 --> 00:17:14,455
Absolutely.

307
00:17:14,622 --> 00:17:18,083
Okay. Who's the lucky couple?

308
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:23,839
Well, we're the ones getting married,
so I guess it's them.

309
00:17:25,007 --> 00:17:27,510
- Charlie.
- A joke.

310
00:17:27,676 --> 00:17:30,179
Alrighty. Now, before we begin
the ceremony...

311
00:17:30,346 --> 00:17:33,307
I need both your signatures
there and there.

312
00:17:33,516 --> 00:17:35,184
Okay.

313
00:17:35,351 --> 00:17:39,605
So are you folks staying in Vegas or are
you honeymooning somewhere else?

314
00:17:39,772 --> 00:17:41,941
I don't know.
What do you think, sweetie?

315
00:17:42,107 --> 00:17:44,485
Oh, can I talk to you for a second?

316
00:17:45,736 --> 00:17:47,529
What'd I say?
Am I in trouble already?

317
00:17:49,531 --> 00:17:52,910
Baby, I swear to God,
I think we're the lucky couple.

318
00:17:53,410 --> 00:17:55,996
Relax, I just want to talk to you
about our honeymoon.

319
00:17:57,498 --> 00:17:59,291
I'll take you anywhere you wanna go.

320
00:17:59,458 --> 00:18:01,752
Frankly, I'd pick a place
with a nice ceiling...

321
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:04,421
because we're just gonna take turns
looking at it.

322
00:18:06,215 --> 00:18:08,842
Charlie, I would love to honeymoon
with you.

323
00:18:09,009 --> 00:18:10,761
But, well, I have to work...

324
00:18:10,928 --> 00:18:14,139
and I think it'd be smarter
to use the money to redo the house.

325
00:18:14,515 --> 00:18:17,309
Oh, I get it.
You gave up trying to change me...

326
00:18:17,476 --> 00:18:19,520
so now the house has to suffer?

327
00:18:19,853 --> 00:18:22,856
If we're gonna have a family,
we'll turn the second bedroom...

328
00:18:23,023 --> 00:18:26,151
- ... into a nursery.
- But that's where Jake stays.

329
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:27,611
But once Alan moves out...

330
00:18:27,778 --> 00:18:30,239
then Jake won't be staying there
anymore, right?

331
00:18:30,406 --> 00:18:33,492
- Alan's moving out?
- Of course he is.

332
00:18:34,159 --> 00:18:35,202
Isn't he?

333
00:18:36,787 --> 00:18:39,373
This is so romantic.

334
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:42,167
When I was a little girl,
I used to love playing bride.

335
00:18:42,334 --> 00:18:43,836
Me too.

336
00:18:44,712 --> 00:18:47,798
I mean, I was the groom.

337
00:18:48,090 --> 00:18:50,009
Most of the time.

338
00:18:50,592 --> 00:18:52,469
You think you'll ever
get married again?

339
00:18:52,636 --> 00:18:54,972
I don't know. I hope so.

340
00:18:55,431 --> 00:18:57,683
You should because you'd make
a good husband.

341
00:18:57,850 --> 00:19:03,272
You're kind, considerate, dependable and
you're cuter than a duck wearing a hat.

342
00:19:05,858 --> 00:19:08,736
Oh, come on, Charlie,
we need our privacy.

343
00:19:08,902 --> 00:19:11,280
But they're my family.
I can't just kick them out.

344
00:19:11,488 --> 00:19:13,407
You could've said something
before now.

345
00:19:13,574 --> 00:19:18,078
Who knew your idea of marriage
was you and me alone in a house?

346
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:22,791
As long as I've known you, you've been
complaining about Alan living with you.

347
00:19:22,958 --> 00:19:25,127
And you want to take that
away from me?

348
00:19:25,294 --> 00:19:28,589
I thought you were ready to grow up
but clearly I was wrong.

349
00:19:28,756 --> 00:19:32,259
What's more grown up than wanting
to take care of my family?

350
00:19:32,426 --> 00:19:34,970
Let's not forget, you're the one
who came back to me.

351
00:19:35,137 --> 00:19:37,306
I only came back
because I wanted your sperm.

352
00:19:37,473 --> 00:19:39,433
Yeah, well, it's a package deal.

353
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:43,103
My sperm and my brother
go hand in hand.

354
00:19:46,565 --> 00:19:49,026
Kandi, this is so sudden.

355
00:19:49,193 --> 00:19:51,945
I know. But lots of good things
are sudden.

356
00:19:52,112 --> 00:19:55,282
Like sun showers, orgasms.

357
00:19:55,866 --> 00:19:57,117
That's two things.

358
00:19:57,659 --> 00:19:59,244
Multiple orgasms.

359
00:20:00,996 --> 00:20:02,998
That's five.

360
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:07,211
All right, deal's off.
Let's get out of here.

361
00:20:07,377 --> 00:20:09,838
Hang on. Are you really serious
about this?

362
00:20:10,005 --> 00:20:12,925
You love me, I love you,
the sex is great.

363
00:20:13,091 --> 00:20:15,093
The sex is unbelievable.

364
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:17,221
Wait, what'd you say?

365
00:20:17,596 --> 00:20:19,681
I said the wedding's off.

366
00:20:19,848 --> 00:20:21,225
Oh, my God, what happened?

367
00:20:22,434 --> 00:20:23,477
It doesn't matter.

368
00:20:23,644 --> 00:20:26,396
What's important is I just avoided
making a huge mistake.

369
00:20:26,563 --> 00:20:27,856
Charlie, I am so sorry.

370
00:20:28,065 --> 00:20:29,149
Oh, thanks.

371
00:20:29,316 --> 00:20:32,945
Now let's head for a strip joint,
get drunk and let the healing begin.

372
00:20:33,111 --> 00:20:35,489
Yeah, but before we do that,
I was wondering...

373
00:20:35,656 --> 00:20:38,200
- ... could I ask you for a little favor.
- Yeah?

374
00:20:38,367 --> 00:20:40,744
- Can I borrow your wedding ring?
- What for?

375
00:20:41,453 --> 00:20:45,791
Well, I thought as long
as we're in Vegas, I'd marry Kandi.

376
00:20:49,002 --> 00:20:51,255
Are you insane?

377
00:20:51,421 --> 00:20:53,257
Oh, come on, you're not using it.

378
00:20:58,303 --> 00:21:01,348
By the powers vested in me
by the state of Nevada...

379
00:21:01,515 --> 00:21:04,685
I now pronounce you man and wife.
You may kiss the bride.

380
00:21:07,896 --> 00:21:10,732
I don't freaking believe it.

381
00:21:12,734 --> 00:21:15,862
Cheer up, Charlie. You're finally getting
what you always wanted.

382
00:21:16,029 --> 00:21:18,573
I'm moving out of your house.

383
00:21:20,659 --> 00:21:23,578
I don't freaking believe it.
