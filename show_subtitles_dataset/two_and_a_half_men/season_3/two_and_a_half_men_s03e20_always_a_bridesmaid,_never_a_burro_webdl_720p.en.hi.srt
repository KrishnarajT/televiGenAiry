1
00:00:06,127 --> 00:00:09,380
Hey, what are you doing home
in the middle of the afternoon?

2
00:00:09,547 --> 00:00:11,716
Look outside.

3
00:00:15,428 --> 00:00:17,805
I guess the day got away from me.

4
00:00:19,849 --> 00:00:23,102
- So you still depressed?
- What do you think?

5
00:00:23,269 --> 00:00:24,478
By the looks of things...

6
00:00:24,645 --> 00:00:29,025
I'd say you're one sad song away
from deep-throating a shotgun.

7
00:00:29,191 --> 00:00:32,069
Be a pal and put down a tarp first.

8
00:00:33,821 --> 00:00:35,906
How did my life get to this point,
Charlie?

9
00:00:36,073 --> 00:00:38,409
How does how does a man
sink this low?

10
00:00:38,576 --> 00:00:42,079
Well, in all fairness,
you had a running start.

11
00:00:44,373 --> 00:00:46,125
Sorry, sorry. Go on.

12
00:00:46,834 --> 00:00:48,544
Things were going so well.

13
00:00:48,711 --> 00:00:52,590
I had a young, hot girlfriend
who fulfilled all my sexual desires.

14
00:00:52,757 --> 00:00:57,178
- How many desires are we talking about?
- Just the one. You know...

15
00:00:58,804 --> 00:01:00,765
for sex.

16
00:01:01,474 --> 00:01:03,768
But now she's gone.

17
00:01:03,934 --> 00:01:07,313
Buddy, she's not really gone.

18
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:09,231
You know where she is.

19
00:01:09,398 --> 00:01:11,150
Yeah.

20
00:01:12,068 --> 00:01:13,402
And where is that, Alan?

21
00:01:14,904 --> 00:01:16,614
Why are you doing this?

22
00:01:17,323 --> 00:01:20,785
Say it, Alan. The healing begins
when you can say it out loud.

23
00:01:22,953 --> 00:01:26,999
My girlfriend is living with my ex-wife.

24
00:01:28,042 --> 00:01:29,960
You know, I was wrong.

25
00:01:30,377 --> 00:01:33,255
It's not the healing that begins
when you say it out loud...

26
00:01:33,422 --> 00:01:35,299
it's the laughter.

27
00:01:36,550 --> 00:01:38,135
Nice talking to you.

28
00:01:38,302 --> 00:01:39,762
Wait, wait, wait.

29
00:01:39,929 --> 00:01:43,140
Hold on. Don't you wanna hear
how I can help you with all this?

30
00:01:43,307 --> 00:01:46,477
I'm not going back to Tijuana
for another X-rated performance...

31
00:01:46,644 --> 00:01:48,896
of The Bride and the Burro.

32
00:01:53,526 --> 00:01:56,487
Okay. First of all,
that's not what I was gonna suggest.

33
00:01:56,987 --> 00:02:00,282
But if you recall, that trip
got you through a particularly dark...

34
00:02:00,449 --> 00:02:02,159
depressing part of your divorce.

35
00:02:02,326 --> 00:02:05,955
The first time you smiled in months
was when you caught the bouquet.

36
00:02:06,121 --> 00:02:07,998
All right,
against my better judgment...

37
00:02:08,165 --> 00:02:10,835
I'm gonna go and ask.
How do you propose to help me?

38
00:02:11,001 --> 00:02:14,755
Well, first let's make sure
that we agree on the problem.

39
00:02:15,005 --> 00:02:17,716
- Your ex-wife befriended your girlfriend.
- Yes.

40
00:02:18,342 --> 00:02:21,470
And your girlfriend has moved in
with your ex-wife.

41
00:02:21,637 --> 00:02:22,680
Yes.

42
00:02:22,847 --> 00:02:25,432
Your ex-wife is turning
your girlfriend against you.

43
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:27,101
Do we have to go through this?

44
00:02:27,268 --> 00:02:30,187
Just until it stops being funny.

45
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:36,485
Anyway, it would seem to me
the simple solution is to find someone...

46
00:02:36,652 --> 00:02:39,321
to speak to Kandi on your behalf.
Someone she trusts.

47
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:41,865
Yes, that would be great.
Now, what's your point?

48
00:02:42,032 --> 00:02:43,492
Charlie?

49
00:02:45,035 --> 00:02:46,370
If you're not coming back...

50
00:02:46,537 --> 00:02:49,832
at least tell me
where you keep the fresh batteries.

51
00:02:50,499 --> 00:02:52,459
I'll be right up.

52
00:02:52,835 --> 00:02:54,753
And it's rechargeable.

53
00:02:57,214 --> 00:03:00,968
My point is,
I'm banging Kandi's mom.

54
00:03:01,969 --> 00:03:03,095
What?

55
00:03:04,722 --> 00:03:06,807
You're welcome.

56
00:03:42,634 --> 00:03:44,303
Who is it?

57
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:46,263
You know damn well who it is.

58
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:48,849
I'm entertaining.

59
00:03:49,016 --> 00:03:52,394
Not as much as you seem to think.

60
00:03:52,853 --> 00:03:54,146
Hang on.

61
00:03:54,313 --> 00:03:57,107
No, not you. You let go.

62
00:03:57,983 --> 00:03:59,485
Come on in, Alan.

63
00:03:59,651 --> 00:04:03,238
- Are you decent?
- He's above average.

64
00:04:04,448 --> 00:04:06,575
Just come in.

65
00:04:10,621 --> 00:04:12,164
Come on.

66
00:04:12,331 --> 00:04:16,418
Oh, he's cute.
I can see why Kandi likes him.

67
00:04:16,585 --> 00:04:17,836
Used to like him.

68
00:04:18,003 --> 00:04:23,008
Oh yeah, I'm so sorry about that.
Come, sit. Let's talk about it.

69
00:04:23,634 --> 00:04:25,302
Are you sure I'm not interrupting?

70
00:04:25,469 --> 00:04:26,845
Don't worry about it.

71
00:04:27,012 --> 00:04:29,473
Kind of hit
the seventh-inning stretch anyway.

72
00:04:30,224 --> 00:04:31,850
You can go two more innings?

73
00:04:32,017 --> 00:04:35,187
Even if I have to start throwing
knuckle balls.

74
00:04:35,896 --> 00:04:36,939
Sit down.

75
00:04:37,606 --> 00:04:39,108
Okay.

76
00:04:40,734 --> 00:04:43,904
So you're Kandi's mom, huh?

77
00:04:44,363 --> 00:04:46,156
- Mandi.
- Alan.

78
00:04:46,323 --> 00:04:47,449
Some grip, huh?

79
00:04:51,161 --> 00:04:53,956
Well, Mandi, I can see where—

80
00:04:54,123 --> 00:04:56,458
Where your daughter
gets her good looks from.

81
00:04:56,625 --> 00:04:59,461
Thank you. You know,
a lot of people think we're sisters.

82
00:04:59,628 --> 00:05:03,132
Oh, there's a mental picture that'll get
me through the last two innings.

83
00:05:03,298 --> 00:05:05,884
- Don't be naughty.
- Why, are you gonna spank me?

84
00:05:06,051 --> 00:05:08,470
- I just might.
- I just might let you.

85
00:05:09,805 --> 00:05:11,431
I just might go hang myself.

86
00:05:12,599 --> 00:05:14,142
Oh, relax.

87
00:05:14,309 --> 00:05:16,186
Oh, Kandi said he was a little shy.

88
00:05:16,353 --> 00:05:19,022
First time they had sex,
he didn't take his shirt off.

89
00:05:19,189 --> 00:05:21,066
Excuse me, that wasn't shyness.

90
00:05:21,233 --> 00:05:24,653
The first time I had sex with your
daughter, I barely got my pants off.

91
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:29,783
Whoa, whoa, whoa, boundaries.
This is Kandi's mom.

92
00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:34,329
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't mean
to create an awkward moment.

93
00:05:36,331 --> 00:05:38,375
But enough about me.

94
00:05:39,668 --> 00:05:42,504
How is it that you two are...

95
00:05:43,171 --> 00:05:44,590
I mean, you know...

96
00:05:44,756 --> 00:05:47,134
how did you exactly—?

97
00:05:47,968 --> 00:05:49,928
What the hell is going on here?

98
00:05:50,429 --> 00:05:53,307
Good question, and a great story.

99
00:05:53,473 --> 00:05:56,059
Mandi showed up here
looking for Kandi.

100
00:05:57,728 --> 00:05:59,438
That's not a great story.

101
00:05:59,771 --> 00:06:04,026
Sure it is. It's already had like
half a dozen happy endings.

102
00:06:04,484 --> 00:06:06,987
You are definitely going over my knee.

103
00:06:07,154 --> 00:06:08,905
Alan, we gotta wrap it up here.

104
00:06:09,072 --> 00:06:11,158
But you said
you'd help me with Kandi.

105
00:06:11,325 --> 00:06:12,784
I didn't say now.

106
00:06:12,951 --> 00:06:15,954
- Do you want me to talk to her?
- I would really appreciate it.

107
00:06:16,121 --> 00:06:19,958
Excuse me, but the pitcher's all
warmed up and ready to take the mound.

108
00:06:20,917 --> 00:06:23,587
Of course,
I'm kind of busy at the moment.

109
00:06:23,754 --> 00:06:25,547
Got it.

110
00:06:30,594 --> 00:06:33,347
Oh, charge!

111
00:06:40,937 --> 00:06:43,482
- Hey, Dad. Mom, Dad's here.
- Hey.

112
00:06:43,649 --> 00:06:46,360
No, don't, don't bother your mom.
Is Kandi around?

113
00:06:46,526 --> 00:06:49,071
- Yeah, she lives here now.
- I know.

114
00:06:49,237 --> 00:06:51,782
Does this mean she and Mom are gay?

115
00:06:53,617 --> 00:06:56,203
- No, it does not.
- Too bad.

116
00:06:57,704 --> 00:07:01,208
- Why?
- Be a lot easier to explain.

117
00:07:02,417 --> 00:07:07,255
- Could you just tell Kandi I'm here?
- Okay. Kandi, my dad's here.

118
00:07:08,632 --> 00:07:11,093
- What do you want, Alan?
- I wanna talk to Kandi.

119
00:07:11,259 --> 00:07:13,303
- I don't think that's a good idea.
- Why?

120
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:16,765
She's a sweet, innocent girl.
I don't want you to ruin her life too.

121
00:07:16,932 --> 00:07:20,268
- Too? How did I ruin your life?
- You stole my youth.

122
00:07:20,435 --> 00:07:21,770
You took my house.

123
00:07:23,605 --> 00:07:26,108
That seems like a fair trade.

124
00:07:26,483 --> 00:07:29,528
Face it. This escapade with Kandi
is just a pathetic attempt...

125
00:07:29,694 --> 00:07:32,072
to find a younger version of me.

126
00:07:32,989 --> 00:07:35,784
Are you kidding?
Judith, I had a younger version of you...

127
00:07:35,951 --> 00:07:38,411
and let me tell you,
it was no great shakes.

128
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:42,124
It's okay, Judith. I'll talk to him.

129
00:07:42,290 --> 00:07:46,128
He doesn't want to talk to you. There's
only one thing a man is interested in.

130
00:07:46,503 --> 00:07:48,004
What?

131
00:07:48,964 --> 00:07:50,841
Forget it. I'm here if you need me.

132
00:07:53,718 --> 00:07:55,011
Hello, Alan.

133
00:07:56,012 --> 00:07:58,932
Listen, Kandi,
I'm really sorry about our fight.

134
00:07:59,099 --> 00:08:02,227
I know I can be a little bit
of a control freak and—

135
00:08:02,394 --> 00:08:05,355
But I honestly care for you...

136
00:08:05,522 --> 00:08:07,607
and I hope you'll give me
another chance.

137
00:08:07,774 --> 00:08:10,277
I see. Excuse me.

138
00:08:16,533 --> 00:08:18,827
I can't let you steal my youth.

139
00:08:20,954 --> 00:08:23,456
You're not fooling anybody, Judith.

140
00:08:23,623 --> 00:08:25,667
Come on, Kandi,
tell me what you think.

141
00:08:25,834 --> 00:08:30,463
Okay. I think we've reached
an implants in our relationship.

142
00:08:31,590 --> 00:08:32,674
Impasse.

143
00:08:33,884 --> 00:08:38,096
I think we've reached an impasse
in our relationship. Goodbye.

144
00:08:45,437 --> 00:08:47,397
Excuse me,
is this Judith Harper's house?

145
00:08:47,564 --> 00:08:49,816
Yeah. She traded it for her youth.

146
00:08:56,114 --> 00:08:58,575
- Hi, Daddy.
- Hi, sweetheart.

147
00:09:00,452 --> 00:09:02,579
Come on in.
Judith can't wait to meet you.

148
00:09:02,746 --> 00:09:04,039
I can't wait to meet her.

149
00:09:04,205 --> 00:09:07,667
I know you two
are gonna love each other.

150
00:09:09,294 --> 00:09:11,004
I watch one donkey sex show...

151
00:09:11,171 --> 00:09:14,174
and you make me pay for it
the rest of my life.

152
00:09:20,930 --> 00:09:22,557
Who is it?

153
00:09:23,350 --> 00:09:25,894
Don't screw with me, Charlie.
We need to talk.

154
00:09:26,061 --> 00:09:27,646
Give me a sec.

155
00:09:27,812 --> 00:09:30,523
Charlie, you're just making it tighter.

156
00:09:30,690 --> 00:09:33,818
Oh, the hell with it. Come on in, Alan.

157
00:09:37,864 --> 00:09:39,949
- Hey there.
- Hiya.

158
00:09:41,826 --> 00:09:45,955
- You know, I can come back.
- It's okay, Alan. Come, sit.

159
00:09:47,165 --> 00:09:48,833
All right.

160
00:09:51,503 --> 00:09:54,547
So how did it go with Kandi?

161
00:09:55,090 --> 00:09:56,132
If it had gone well...

162
00:09:56,299 --> 00:09:59,678
do you think I'd be sitting here
talking to two half-naked people?

163
00:09:59,844 --> 00:10:01,346
- Alan?
- What?

164
00:10:01,513 --> 00:10:03,348
I'm completely naked.

165
00:10:05,767 --> 00:10:06,893
What happened, Alan?

166
00:10:07,936 --> 00:10:11,606
Well, as I suspected, Judith has turned
your daughter against me.

167
00:10:11,773 --> 00:10:15,318
Well, I'm not surprised.
Kandi's always been very suggestible.

168
00:10:15,485 --> 00:10:19,114
You know, until she was 8
she thought this was her nose.

169
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:20,365
That's kind of cute.

170
00:10:20,532 --> 00:10:24,411
When Alan was 8, I convinced him
he only had two weeks to live.

171
00:10:24,577 --> 00:10:27,956
But I suppose that tells you more
about me than him.

172
00:10:28,456 --> 00:10:31,292
Yeah, good times.

173
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:35,839
But back to recent events—

174
00:10:36,339 --> 00:10:40,552
Remember when I told you the cat-litter
box was filled with Almond Roca?

175
00:10:40,718 --> 00:10:42,512
He ate four of them.

176
00:10:43,972 --> 00:10:47,475
Are we done visiting Charlie Harper's
Museum of Sibling Cruelty?

177
00:10:49,102 --> 00:10:50,728
I have something to talk about.

178
00:10:50,895 --> 00:10:54,774
Oh, I'm sorry.
I didn't realize I was interrupting you.

179
00:10:55,817 --> 00:10:56,943
Go ahead, Alan.

180
00:10:57,110 --> 00:10:58,153
Thank you.

181
00:10:58,319 --> 00:11:00,321
So as I was leaving
my ex-wife's house...

182
00:11:00,488 --> 00:11:02,282
I ran into your ex-husband.

183
00:11:02,448 --> 00:11:03,908
- Andy?
- I guess.

184
00:11:04,075 --> 00:11:07,787
Wait a second.
It's Mandi, Andy and Kandi?

185
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:10,248
What's your point?

186
00:11:10,999 --> 00:11:12,709
No point.

187
00:11:13,626 --> 00:11:15,712
Mandi, Andy, Kandi.

188
00:11:16,171 --> 00:11:17,338
Dandy.

189
00:11:19,424 --> 00:11:24,637
Anyway, it appears as if Kandi has set
my ex-wife up on a blind date with him.

190
00:11:25,138 --> 00:11:26,389
How nice.

191
00:11:26,556 --> 00:11:28,016
Nice? How is that nice?

192
00:11:28,183 --> 00:11:30,685
Well, he's been kind of depressed
since we broke up.

193
00:11:30,852 --> 00:11:33,146
It's good to see
he's getting back on the horse.

194
00:11:33,479 --> 00:11:36,191
But that horse is my ex-wife.

195
00:11:36,357 --> 00:11:39,861
Speaking of which, did you ever see
The Bride and the Burro in Tijuana?

196
00:11:40,278 --> 00:11:42,822
See it? I caught the bouquet.

197
00:11:43,656 --> 00:11:45,491
So did Alan.

198
00:11:47,744 --> 00:11:50,204
Always a bridesmaid, never a burro.

199
00:11:51,789 --> 00:11:54,584
Charlie,
l' m starting to lose feeling in my arm.

200
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:56,127
Oh, l' m sorry.

201
00:11:56,294 --> 00:11:59,422
Hey, you went pretty far in the scouts.
Can you undo this knot?

202
00:11:59,589 --> 00:12:02,008
Gee, actually,
I specialized in lndian lore.

203
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:05,345
Beaded belts, arrowheads.
But, good luck though.

204
00:12:06,262 --> 00:12:08,306
Maybe you should go get
a pair of scissors.

205
00:12:08,473 --> 00:12:11,517
Hang on, let me untie my feet.

206
00:12:14,437 --> 00:12:17,315
We really didn't think this through,
did we?

207
00:12:21,361 --> 00:12:25,198
So has your mom
been seeing a lot of Kandi's dad?

208
00:12:26,157 --> 00:12:30,787
That's right. If she married him,
Kandi would be your stepsister.

209
00:12:31,621 --> 00:12:35,333
Hey, hey, hey, do you happen to know
if they're going out tonight?

210
00:12:36,167 --> 00:12:39,295
Yep, if I married Kandi,
she would be your stepmother.

211
00:12:39,462 --> 00:12:40,880
But—

212
00:12:41,047 --> 00:12:44,258
But tonight—
Is your mom going out tonight?

213
00:12:45,259 --> 00:12:49,597
Yeah, yeah, I get it. If Kandi
took a poop, it would be your step-stool.

214
00:13:00,233 --> 00:13:02,318
All right, well...

215
00:13:02,610 --> 00:13:05,071
it's always good to talk to you.

216
00:13:05,947 --> 00:13:07,865
Love you, buddy.

217
00:13:09,075 --> 00:13:10,410
Did you get all that, Berta?

218
00:13:11,327 --> 00:13:14,122
I think so, but let's do a quick recap.

219
00:13:14,288 --> 00:13:16,416
Your girlfriend's
living with your ex-wife.

220
00:13:16,582 --> 00:13:19,168
Your ex-wife's
dating your girlfriend's father.

221
00:13:19,335 --> 00:13:22,130
To top it off,
you're trying to get useful intelligence...

222
00:13:22,296 --> 00:13:24,882
from a kid who's got
precious little to spare.

223
00:13:25,675 --> 00:13:27,093
Okay, just checking.

224
00:13:27,677 --> 00:13:28,720
Hey, Berta.

225
00:13:29,512 --> 00:13:31,931
- I want you to meet Mandi. Mandi, Berta.
- Hi.

226
00:13:34,517 --> 00:13:36,102
Listen...

227
00:13:36,269 --> 00:13:38,271
we got a pair of scissors handy?

228
00:13:38,438 --> 00:13:40,857
Oh, Charlie, that's a silk tie.

229
00:13:41,023 --> 00:13:43,443
Why didn't you use
one of the poly blends?

230
00:13:43,609 --> 00:13:47,196
Hey, hey, wait a minute, that's my tie.
You ruined my tie.

231
00:13:47,572 --> 00:13:48,990
Oh, yeah.

232
00:13:49,157 --> 00:13:52,827
You're not gonna be happy
about your electric toothbrush either.

233
00:13:55,079 --> 00:13:57,623
Kandi's told me
so many nice things about you.

234
00:13:57,790 --> 00:13:59,000
How do you know Kandi?

235
00:13:59,167 --> 00:14:01,377
- She's my daughter.
- Your daughter?

236
00:14:01,544 --> 00:14:03,087
Sweet whistling Geronimo.

237
00:14:03,254 --> 00:14:07,425
You people are like a box of hamsters,
just crawling all over each other.

238
00:14:09,010 --> 00:14:10,178
Yes, yes.

239
00:14:11,179 --> 00:14:14,223
- We all get how this looks, Berta.
- Hey, I'm not knocking it.

240
00:14:14,390 --> 00:14:18,060
I'm just wondering when some of that
gravy's gonna spill over on my taters.

241
00:14:27,987 --> 00:14:29,030
Hey, what's up?

242
00:14:30,907 --> 00:14:32,909
What's up? What are you doing here?

243
00:14:33,075 --> 00:14:35,661
Well, Mandi came over
to put in a good word for you...

244
00:14:35,828 --> 00:14:38,581
and I figured I'd tag along for grins.

245
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:41,626
Here comes one now.

246
00:14:44,003 --> 00:14:45,671
Come on in.

247
00:14:46,547 --> 00:14:49,884
I'm in a nightmare
and I can't wake up.

248
00:14:51,093 --> 00:14:53,012
Sit down. Make yourself at home.

249
00:14:56,807 --> 00:14:58,100
Thanks...

250
00:14:58,267 --> 00:14:59,477
I will.

251
00:14:59,810 --> 00:15:03,105
- Where's— Where's Jake?
- He's at a sleepover.

252
00:15:03,814 --> 00:15:05,524
Hi, Alan.

253
00:15:05,691 --> 00:15:06,943
How are you?

254
00:15:07,109 --> 00:15:09,946
About two heartbeats
from a brain aneurysm.

255
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:12,323
Where's Kandi?

256
00:15:12,490 --> 00:15:15,159
She's in her room.
But I thought we should talk first.

257
00:15:17,328 --> 00:15:20,081
We just have a few questions.

258
00:15:20,414 --> 00:15:21,457
About what?

259
00:15:22,333 --> 00:15:23,834
Charlie?

260
00:15:24,001 --> 00:15:28,214
Well, Kandi's mom and I are
a little concerned about your intentions.

261
00:15:32,009 --> 00:15:33,678
You should be...

262
00:15:33,844 --> 00:15:35,513
because I intend to kill you.

263
00:15:39,767 --> 00:15:41,227
That's the kind of attitude...

264
00:15:41,394 --> 00:15:44,814
that isn't gonna win you
a lot of friends around here, mister.

265
00:15:45,648 --> 00:15:47,733
Alan, you're a very sweet man.

266
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:49,235
But let's face facts.

267
00:15:49,402 --> 00:15:52,363
Kandi has her whole life ahead of her,
while you...

268
00:15:52,530 --> 00:15:54,573
not so much.

269
00:15:55,908 --> 00:15:58,411
- Kandi?
- Alan?

270
00:15:58,577 --> 00:16:01,080
- I am so sorry.
- No, I'm sorry.

271
00:16:02,999 --> 00:16:04,834
Oh, isn't that sweet?

272
00:16:06,168 --> 00:16:08,879
- I missed you so much.
- I missed you too, huggy bear.

273
00:16:09,255 --> 00:16:12,216
Mom, I'm gonna go have sex with Alan,
okay?

274
00:16:12,383 --> 00:16:14,343
You kids have fun.

275
00:16:16,345 --> 00:16:19,265
- Hold on there, young man.
- What?

276
00:16:19,432 --> 00:16:22,852
Don't be a selfish lover.
Consider her needs.

277
00:16:24,270 --> 00:16:26,188
This isn't over.

278
00:16:30,818 --> 00:16:34,613
You're right.
He is easy to screw with.

279
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:39,201
Hey, four pieces of Almond Roca.
Even the cat was laughing at him.

280
00:16:40,619 --> 00:16:42,705
So should we head back to my place?

281
00:16:43,664 --> 00:16:44,957
I suppose.

282
00:16:45,374 --> 00:16:46,542
What's wrong?

283
00:16:46,709 --> 00:16:48,711
Nothing. It's just...

284
00:16:48,878 --> 00:16:50,796
we've already had sex there.

285
00:16:50,963 --> 00:16:54,467
Oh, baby. I really, really like you.

286
00:16:55,342 --> 00:16:57,803
Well, thank you, Judith.
I had a wonderful evening.

287
00:16:57,970 --> 00:17:00,556
I hope we can do it again some—

288
00:17:06,937 --> 00:17:09,607
Maybe catch a movie.

289
00:17:10,608 --> 00:17:12,902
Or go for a hike.

290
00:17:15,237 --> 00:17:17,823
I'm guessing that's your ex-husband.

291
00:17:17,990 --> 00:17:20,326
- Good-looking man.
- Oh, he's gorgeous.

292
00:17:20,493 --> 00:17:21,744
Dumb as wood.

293
00:17:21,911 --> 00:17:23,204
Oh, my Lord.

294
00:17:23,621 --> 00:17:25,998
But it's good wood.

295
00:17:27,875 --> 00:17:32,338
- I better find Alan so we can get out.
- You wanna leave? This is so hot.

296
00:17:32,505 --> 00:17:36,425
Oh, Mandi, you just keep getting better
and better.

297
00:17:36,592 --> 00:17:41,222
- Hang on while I give Alan a heads up.
- Hurry back and give me one.

298
00:17:50,314 --> 00:17:52,066
Alan?

299
00:17:57,029 --> 00:17:58,614
Alan?

300
00:17:58,781 --> 00:18:01,659
You're the most beautiful man
I've ever seen.

301
00:18:01,825 --> 00:18:03,619
Not Alan.

302
00:18:05,663 --> 00:18:07,498
Couldn't find him.

303
00:18:08,958 --> 00:18:10,459
Mandi.

304
00:18:10,834 --> 00:18:12,211
Mandi.

305
00:18:12,378 --> 00:18:14,171
You know what else I like?
Swap meets.

306
00:18:14,338 --> 00:18:16,257
- Swell.
- Yeah.

307
00:18:16,423 --> 00:18:19,218
Your ex-husband
must be a real little guy, huh?

308
00:18:19,385 --> 00:18:22,513
Forget about him.
Let's get some wine in you.

309
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:30,562
Mandi.

310
00:18:30,938 --> 00:18:33,065
Glasses are in there.

311
00:18:35,401 --> 00:18:36,986
No, no, top shelf.

312
00:18:42,241 --> 00:18:44,702
That's what I'm talking about.

313
00:18:48,372 --> 00:18:52,668
Hey, you ever go rock climbing?
It's a great workout.

314
00:18:56,797 --> 00:18:58,674
Mandi?

315
00:19:03,345 --> 00:19:04,930
Mandi.

316
00:19:06,306 --> 00:19:07,975
Alan?

317
00:19:08,475 --> 00:19:10,436
- Anybody?
- Over here.

318
00:19:15,149 --> 00:19:16,608
Damn it.

319
00:19:20,112 --> 00:19:23,365
- What are you doing?
- I was thirsty.

320
00:19:23,907 --> 00:19:27,619
- Have you seen Alan?
- I've been in the closet.

321
00:19:28,078 --> 00:19:29,663
So where the hell is he?

322
00:19:29,830 --> 00:19:31,874
Oh, my, I'm sorry I'm so nervous.

323
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:34,376
I haven't been with another woman
in a long time.

324
00:19:34,543 --> 00:19:37,379
Yeah, yeah, take off your robe.

325
00:19:37,546 --> 00:19:39,006
Okay.

326
00:19:39,465 --> 00:19:41,884
Hot damn.

327
00:19:42,426 --> 00:19:45,637
Yeah, it is hot.

328
00:19:53,729 --> 00:19:56,356
- Hi, Daddy.
- Hey, Judith.

329
00:19:58,650 --> 00:20:00,986
Daddy,
I want you to meet my boyfriend, Alan.

330
00:20:01,570 --> 00:20:04,656
- Nice to see you again.
- Small world.

331
00:20:11,663 --> 00:20:15,209
- I said I was sorry.
- Just get out.

332
00:20:15,876 --> 00:20:19,171
I'll give you a call, Judith.
Maybe we'll hit some garage sales.

333
00:20:19,338 --> 00:20:21,173
Yeah, terrific.

334
00:20:26,011 --> 00:20:27,554
I like your daughter.

335
00:20:28,305 --> 00:20:30,349
I like your ex-wife.

336
00:20:31,767 --> 00:20:32,893
Wanna get a drink?

337
00:20:34,686 --> 00:20:36,188
I'm not doing anything.

338
00:20:38,315 --> 00:20:40,776
Do you like garage sales?

339
00:20:41,985 --> 00:20:44,112
Where am I supposed to go?

340
00:20:44,279 --> 00:20:46,740
I don't care. Just leave.

341
00:20:46,907 --> 00:20:48,784
But I thought we were friends.

342
00:20:48,951 --> 00:20:53,121
Friends don't have sex with their friends'
ex-husbands in the first friend's hot tub.

343
00:20:57,417 --> 00:21:00,504
Divorced three years
and he's still ruining my life.

344
00:21:00,671 --> 00:21:03,799
Should have drowned his stupid ass.

345
00:21:07,135 --> 00:21:09,596
- Did you hear something?
