1
00:00:03,162 --> 00:00:04,997
You know
what I've been thinking about?

2
00:00:05,164 --> 00:00:07,958
- What?
- The death penalty.

3
00:00:08,959 --> 00:00:12,087
Really? That's a—
That's a very complex issue.

4
00:00:12,254 --> 00:00:14,048
So— So, what are your thoughts?

5
00:00:14,214 --> 00:00:17,051
If you're going to the chair
they give you what you want...

6
00:00:17,217 --> 00:00:18,594
for your last meal.

7
00:00:18,761 --> 00:00:20,137
I guess.

8
00:00:20,304 --> 00:00:24,224
- I'm gonna order cereal.
- Why?

9
00:00:24,391 --> 00:00:28,395
Because if you keep adding milk
you can make it last forever.

10
00:00:29,063 --> 00:00:31,899
And they just gotta wait.

11
00:00:32,650 --> 00:00:34,568
Okay, let's go back a bit.

12
00:00:34,735 --> 00:00:37,738
Why would you be going to the chair
in the first place?

13
00:00:37,905 --> 00:00:41,492
I don't know.
My DNA shows up at a murder scene...

14
00:00:41,825 --> 00:00:45,913
because it's planted by a crooked cop
or maybe one of my teachers.

15
00:00:46,497 --> 00:00:50,250
- So you'd be wrongly accused?
- Story of my life, Dad.

16
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:54,088
Remember that water pistol incident
at school?

17
00:00:54,254 --> 00:00:56,006
But that was your water pistol.

18
00:00:56,173 --> 00:00:59,051
Yes, but it wasn't my pee.

19
00:01:01,303 --> 00:01:02,805
Morning.

20
00:01:02,971 --> 00:01:04,264
Oh, hey, how was your run?

21
00:01:04,431 --> 00:01:07,017
Great. We made it
all the way to the pier and back.

22
00:01:07,184 --> 00:01:09,061
Didn't we, honey?

23
00:01:10,604 --> 00:01:12,272
Yeah.

24
00:01:12,648 --> 00:01:14,900
Pier. Back.

25
00:01:16,068 --> 00:01:18,362
Hey, Jake,
you ever seen anybody cough up blood?

26
00:01:19,363 --> 00:01:21,365
- Nope.
- Then pay attention.

27
00:01:22,074 --> 00:01:25,452
- Ass.
- Ass?

28
00:01:25,661 --> 00:01:27,371
Kiss.

29
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,748
My.

30
00:01:30,541 --> 00:01:32,459
Sweaty.

31
00:01:34,795 --> 00:01:38,215
I think I'll jump in the shower.
Wanna join me?

32
00:01:38,382 --> 00:01:40,050
Can't.

33
00:01:40,592 --> 00:01:42,177
Later.

34
00:01:42,344 --> 00:01:44,096
Maybe.

35
00:01:44,763 --> 00:01:47,599
All right. Well,
you drink your health shake, all right?

36
00:01:47,766 --> 00:01:50,394
- You'll feel better.
- Doubt it.

37
00:01:54,815 --> 00:01:57,901
- What's in that?
- I don't know.

38
00:01:58,068 --> 00:02:00,404
Vitamins, minerals, protein.

39
00:02:00,571 --> 00:02:03,991
Whatever it is, it's flushing out stuff
I ate in high school.

40
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:10,581
Hey, do you think they let you
have a last poop after your last meal?

41
00:02:14,418 --> 00:02:15,502
What?

42
00:02:15,669 --> 00:02:17,963
Because as long as you're sitting on
the can...

43
00:02:18,130 --> 00:02:20,549
technically you're still pooping.

44
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:22,968
And they gotta wait.

45
00:02:24,094 --> 00:02:25,179
Go get dressed.

46
00:02:25,721 --> 00:02:29,057
If they made you hold one in,
that'd be cruel and unusual punishment.

47
00:02:33,854 --> 00:02:36,356
You know, I am impressed
with what you're doing here.

48
00:02:36,523 --> 00:02:40,193
Exercising, eating right,
laying off the cigars and the booze.

49
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,529
I mean,
Mia has really done wonders with you.

50
00:02:42,696 --> 00:02:44,698
- Y eah, she's an incredible woman.
- She is.

51
00:02:44,865 --> 00:02:46,533
- And I'm a lucky guy.
- You are.

52
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:48,785
Why is there
this little voice in my head...

53
00:02:48,952 --> 00:02:52,122
that keeps whispering,
"Kill yourself. Do it now. "

54
00:02:53,457 --> 00:02:55,208
Don't worry about that. It's common.

55
00:02:55,375 --> 00:02:56,418
- Really?
- Oh, yeah.

56
00:02:56,585 --> 00:03:00,297
Every man who gets into a long-term,
committed relationship hears that voice.

57
00:03:00,464 --> 00:03:02,925
Mine sounded a little like Alec Baldwin.

58
00:03:03,091 --> 00:03:04,176
I don't know why.

59
00:03:04,343 --> 00:03:06,887
Maybe because I enjoyed him
in that submarine movie.

60
00:03:07,387 --> 00:03:09,806
- What was that call—?
- Would you get to the point?

61
00:03:09,973 --> 00:03:12,726
You have to remember that over time
that voice will fade...

62
00:03:12,893 --> 00:03:14,853
when you realize
what you're giving up...

63
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:17,064
is nothing compared
to what you're gaining.

64
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:19,024
What exactly am I gaining?

65
00:03:19,191 --> 00:03:21,276
Are you kidding?
You're gaining a soul mate.

66
00:03:21,443 --> 00:03:23,654
Someone to walk down life's path
with you.

67
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:26,323
Someone who'll always be there,
sharing your hopes...

68
00:03:26,490 --> 00:03:28,617
your joys and your sorrows.

69
00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:30,327
You got nothing.

70
00:03:32,287 --> 00:03:34,873
That's what the minister said
at my wedding.

71
00:03:37,542 --> 00:03:39,670
Hunt for Red October.

72
00:03:48,178 --> 00:03:51,014
Be back in a while, honey.
I'm going for a power walk.

73
00:03:51,181 --> 00:03:54,768
- Pace yourself.
- Don't worry.

74
00:04:50,323 --> 00:04:53,243
This is a good pace.

75
00:04:55,829 --> 00:04:57,581
Hey.

76
00:05:00,208 --> 00:05:01,918
What you doing?

77
00:05:02,085 --> 00:05:03,837
Nothing. Close the damn door.

78
00:05:07,132 --> 00:05:09,718
You told Mia you weren't gonna smoke
or drink anymore.

79
00:05:10,302 --> 00:05:14,431
You told your father you weren't gonna
watch dirty movies on cable anymore.

80
00:05:15,098 --> 00:05:17,225
Don't change the subject.

81
00:05:19,644 --> 00:05:21,938
Mia's gonna be really pissed at you.

82
00:05:22,105 --> 00:05:25,150
Only if she finds out
and she doesn't have to find out.

83
00:05:25,317 --> 00:05:28,111
Well, I guess that depends.

84
00:05:30,572 --> 00:05:32,032
What, are you blackmailing me?

85
00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:34,868
No. I'm just saying
if you don't give me 20 bucks...

86
00:05:35,035 --> 00:05:36,870
I'm gonna tell on you.

87
00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:40,081
That's blackmail.

88
00:05:41,124 --> 00:05:42,626
Well, then, yeah.

89
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:52,177
- Oh, hi, Mom, how are you?
- Deeply hurt.

90
00:05:52,928 --> 00:05:54,304
Is this about me or Charlie?

91
00:05:54,471 --> 00:05:56,306
- Charlie.
- Great. Come on in.

92
00:05:59,976 --> 00:06:03,980
Can you explain to me how your brother
can be in a serious relationship...

93
00:06:04,147 --> 00:06:06,191
and not only
have I not met the woman...

94
00:06:06,358 --> 00:06:09,027
he hasn't even bothered
to tell me her name?

95
00:06:09,194 --> 00:06:11,237
Do you really need an explanation
for that?

96
00:06:11,404 --> 00:06:13,073
Do you want it to be about you?

97
00:06:13,615 --> 00:06:16,743
- Her name's Mia. She's in the kitchen.
- Thank you.

98
00:06:19,079 --> 00:06:21,081
Thank God I didn't know Anne Frank.

99
00:06:24,376 --> 00:06:25,585
Hello.

100
00:06:27,754 --> 00:06:29,339
Hello.

101
00:06:33,635 --> 00:06:37,514
- I'm Evelyn, Charlie's mother.
- I'm Mia, Charlie's girlfriend.

102
00:06:38,139 --> 00:06:41,142
- So we finally meet.
- So we do.

103
00:06:42,602 --> 00:06:43,728
One question.

104
00:06:44,521 --> 00:06:47,524
- I'm listening.
- Can you fix him?

105
00:06:48,274 --> 00:06:49,442
I'm trying.

106
00:06:51,194 --> 00:06:55,865
Fifteen, 1 6, 1 7, 1 8—

107
00:06:56,032 --> 00:06:57,659
Jake?

108
00:06:57,909 --> 00:06:59,786
How about a hug
for your grandmommy?

109
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,996
No, thank you.

110
00:07:03,164 --> 00:07:04,833
One, two—

111
00:07:13,758 --> 00:07:15,802
What the hell are you doing?

112
00:07:15,969 --> 00:07:18,221
Hey, hey, hey. Keep it down.
Keep it down.

113
00:07:18,388 --> 00:07:20,348
Mia thinks I'm taking a power walk.

114
00:07:22,183 --> 00:07:25,145
This is a sad, sad day.

115
00:07:26,938 --> 00:07:29,524
I always figured
you'd be the last guy in the world...

116
00:07:29,691 --> 00:07:31,860
to end up whipped.

117
00:07:32,277 --> 00:07:35,321
I am not whipped. I'm considerate.

118
00:07:36,156 --> 00:07:37,824
- Considerate?
- Yeah.

119
00:07:37,991 --> 00:07:39,951
See, I love Mia
and want her to be happy.

120
00:07:40,118 --> 00:07:42,787
I happen to know she's not happy
when I smoke cigars...

121
00:07:42,954 --> 00:07:45,498
and drink and gamble
and stay out all night...

122
00:07:45,665 --> 00:07:50,211
and eat meat and sugar and grease
and fat and nap and swear...

123
00:07:50,378 --> 00:07:52,464
and wear shorts
and bowling shirts...

124
00:07:52,630 --> 00:07:56,134
Charlie, you ain't just whipped,
you're roped, saddled and gelded.

125
00:07:56,301 --> 00:08:00,096
They could use you
to give rides at kid's birthday parties.

126
00:08:00,263 --> 00:08:03,183
- I am not whipped.
- Yeah.

127
00:08:03,808 --> 00:08:07,520
Here, might as well take one
of these sacks since yours is empty.

128
00:08:07,687 --> 00:08:10,231
Hang on a second.

129
00:08:10,398 --> 00:08:13,735
- That ain't gonna do it, Alice.
- What?

130
00:08:13,902 --> 00:08:17,197
You smell like a beer bottle
that just fell out of Joe Camel's ass.

131
00:08:18,364 --> 00:08:19,949
Well, what am I supposed to do?

132
00:08:20,116 --> 00:08:22,660
Oh, hang on,
let's see if I got anything in here...

133
00:08:22,827 --> 00:08:25,580
that might mask your stench.

134
00:08:25,747 --> 00:08:27,540
Oven cleaner. No.

135
00:08:28,208 --> 00:08:30,585
Ty-D-Bol. No.

136
00:08:30,752 --> 00:08:34,172
How do you feel about taking a whore's
bath with a hunk of blue cheese?

137
00:08:35,882 --> 00:08:39,010
I'm so proud of him. He hasn't had
a drop of alcohol in weeks.

138
00:08:39,177 --> 00:08:41,095
Well, that's one way to go.

139
00:08:41,262 --> 00:08:45,642
But I've found that men who drink
tend to talk less and sleep more.

140
00:08:46,392 --> 00:08:48,811
Which, frankly,
becomes increasingly desirable...

141
00:08:48,978 --> 00:08:50,772
as the years go by.

142
00:08:54,567 --> 00:08:56,694
Oh, this can't be good.

143
00:08:57,487 --> 00:08:59,906
Hello, darling. Wonderful to see you.

144
00:09:00,073 --> 00:09:01,616
Hi, Mom.

145
00:09:03,243 --> 00:09:04,494
Have you been dusting?

146
00:09:06,079 --> 00:09:09,457
- No, why?
- You reek of Lemon Pledge.

147
00:09:10,833 --> 00:09:11,918
You're welcome.

148
00:09:17,924 --> 00:09:19,926
I'll be downstairs.

149
00:09:20,093 --> 00:09:21,803
No snacking, Charlie.

150
00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:24,555
We're going to
the best vegetarian restaurant in town.

151
00:09:25,306 --> 00:09:27,266
Oh, boy.

152
00:09:39,487 --> 00:09:41,948
Oh, thank God. Meat.

153
00:09:42,115 --> 00:09:45,451
- I love you, Rose.
- I love you too, Charlie.

154
00:09:45,618 --> 00:09:48,871
And may I say, I would never
try to change you the way she has.

155
00:09:49,414 --> 00:09:51,874
- Her name's Mia.
- I know what her name is.

156
00:09:52,041 --> 00:09:54,627
I also know where she lives,
her employment history...

157
00:09:54,794 --> 00:09:58,339
and if you want I can get you
photographs of a wet T -shirt contest...

158
00:09:58,506 --> 00:10:04,262
she entered during spring break 1995
at a college bar called Señor Frogs.

159
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:06,264
I forgot who I'm dealing with.

160
00:10:06,431 --> 00:10:08,516
I know you have to hide
to smoke a cigar...

161
00:10:08,683 --> 00:10:10,393
and slam back a warm beer.

162
00:10:10,685 --> 00:10:12,145
What'd you do, bug my garage?

163
00:10:12,311 --> 00:10:13,521
Don't be paranoid.

164
00:10:13,688 --> 00:10:15,857
I have a long-standing arrangement
with Jake.

165
00:10:16,816 --> 00:10:19,193
Charlie, I'm ready.

166
00:10:22,822 --> 00:10:23,990
I'm out here.

167
00:10:24,157 --> 00:10:26,200
Go, go, go.

168
00:10:26,367 --> 00:10:29,203
Okay, I'll go,
but I want you to remember one thing.

169
00:10:29,370 --> 00:10:31,581
- What?
- I'm not gonna wait for you forever.

170
00:10:38,379 --> 00:10:40,173
How do I look?

171
00:10:52,268 --> 00:10:53,311
How's your couscous?

172
00:10:54,645 --> 00:10:56,189
Yum, yum.

173
00:10:57,064 --> 00:10:59,233
I had an interesting chat
with your mom today.

174
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:01,569
Yeah, I'm sorry about that.

175
00:11:01,736 --> 00:11:05,615
I know she comes on a little strong
but her heart's in the right place.

176
00:11:05,781 --> 00:11:10,161
If you mean in a cooler on its way to a
dying man in Tennessee, then we agree.

177
00:11:10,786 --> 00:11:14,165
- You can't possibly mean that.
- I suppose not.

178
00:11:14,332 --> 00:11:17,168
She's too selfish to donate an organ.

179
00:11:17,502 --> 00:11:18,836
Even one she doesn't use.

180
00:11:19,462 --> 00:11:21,839
That's so unfair, Charlie.
Your mother loves you.

181
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:25,635
Really? Did she or did she not say
I was a bitter disappointment?

182
00:11:26,385 --> 00:11:28,513
- Well, she did, but—
- And did she...

183
00:11:28,679 --> 00:11:32,225
or did she not say that
I'm a lazy-ass schlock jingle writer...

184
00:11:32,391 --> 00:11:35,436
who wasted 13 years of piano lessons
that she paid for...

185
00:11:35,603 --> 00:11:38,898
by marrying a series of men
with large wallets and small penises?

186
00:11:39,524 --> 00:11:41,359
Yes, that was mentioned.

187
00:11:42,777 --> 00:11:46,781
It's natural for someone who loves you
to want to see you live to your potential.

188
00:11:47,281 --> 00:11:51,077
Do you want to be known as the guy
who writes songs about adult diapers?

189
00:11:51,410 --> 00:11:54,330
Hey, it's better than being known
as the guy who wears them.

190
00:11:55,206 --> 00:11:58,751
Charlie, we both know
you can do so much more with your life.

191
00:12:00,419 --> 00:12:04,590
Maybe.
But you gotta admire my restraint.

192
00:12:05,258 --> 00:12:09,136
Oh, come on, look how much you've
accomplished since we've been together.

193
00:12:09,303 --> 00:12:12,390
You're exercising regularly,
you cut way down on the drinking...

194
00:12:12,556 --> 00:12:14,016
and you're eating right.

195
00:12:14,183 --> 00:12:17,228
Did you ever think you'd
change your life the way you have?

196
00:12:17,395 --> 00:12:18,980
Never.

197
00:12:20,356 --> 00:12:23,609
It just goes to show, you can do
anything you put your mind to.

198
00:12:28,114 --> 00:12:29,991
I smell meat.

199
00:12:30,908 --> 00:12:31,951
Excuse me?

200
00:12:32,451 --> 00:12:34,829
Your breath. It stinks of meat.

201
00:12:37,039 --> 00:12:40,501
Well, it could be my tongue.

202
00:12:40,710 --> 00:12:42,294
My tongue is meat.

203
00:12:42,461 --> 00:12:45,172
No, you've been eating meat.
I can smell it.

204
00:12:47,091 --> 00:12:50,553
Maybe it's this breast of Tofurky
you smell.

205
00:12:51,137 --> 00:12:54,682
- No, I smell beef.
- Where would I get beef?

206
00:12:54,849 --> 00:12:56,017
You tell me.

207
00:12:56,767 --> 00:12:59,895
Well, maybe it's secondhand beef.

208
00:13:00,312 --> 00:13:03,441
- What?
- You know, like secondhand smoke.

209
00:13:03,607 --> 00:13:04,859
Some thoughtless guy...

210
00:13:05,026 --> 00:13:08,029
who's sitting next to you
eating a steak can—

211
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:12,992
Oh, screw it.

212
00:13:14,035 --> 00:13:17,329
I paid a slightly disturbed woman
to toss a bag of cheeseburgers...

213
00:13:17,496 --> 00:13:19,790
onto the deck
while you were getting dressed.

214
00:13:20,416 --> 00:13:25,171
- Oh, Charlie.
- Don't "Oh, Charlie" me, I was starving.

215
00:13:25,337 --> 00:13:27,673
And I'll tell you another thing,
my power walk...

216
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:32,136
was two quick beers and half a Cuban
cigar while cowering in my own garage.

217
00:13:32,303 --> 00:13:34,180
That's why you smelt like
Lemon Pledge.

218
00:13:34,346 --> 00:13:37,933
Well, it certainly wasn't to bring out
the natural luster of my forehead.

219
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:39,435
So you've been lying to me?

220
00:13:39,935 --> 00:13:43,105
If you mean telling you
I wasn't going to do a bunch of things...

221
00:13:43,272 --> 00:13:47,443
then doing them anyway and lying
about it, then I've been lying to you.

222
00:13:48,736 --> 00:13:52,865
Well, I suppose I can forgive you.
If you promise it'll never happen again.

223
00:13:53,032 --> 00:13:55,159
Oh, it'll never happen again.
You know why?

224
00:13:55,326 --> 00:13:58,329
Because I am done
with this whole charade.

225
00:13:58,496 --> 00:14:01,624
I'm tired of you trying
to make me over into something I'm not.

226
00:14:01,791 --> 00:14:03,751
I'm a grown man,
not a work in progress.

227
00:14:03,918 --> 00:14:06,212
- Charlie, people are staring.
- Let them stare.

228
00:14:07,213 --> 00:14:08,672
You guys know what I mean.

229
00:14:08,839 --> 00:14:11,175
Why can't women
look at a guy for who he is...

230
00:14:11,342 --> 00:14:13,302
instead of
who they can turn him into?

231
00:14:13,469 --> 00:14:15,304
- Please, you're embarrassing me.
- Good.

232
00:14:15,471 --> 00:14:16,972
Maybe now you know how I feel.

233
00:14:17,139 --> 00:14:21,101
Sitting in a restaurant eating medallions
of bean curd with lawn mower sauce.

234
00:14:22,269 --> 00:14:23,312
Am I right?

235
00:14:23,812 --> 00:14:27,691
No man should have to eat anything
with the word "curd" in it.

236
00:14:28,025 --> 00:14:30,194
You know,
you're turning into a real ass here.

237
00:14:30,361 --> 00:14:33,322
Well,
then I'm finally living up to my potential.

238
00:14:33,906 --> 00:14:37,076
I'm a big old bourbon-soaked,
cigar-huffing ass...

239
00:14:37,243 --> 00:14:39,787
as God, in his infinite wisdom,
meant me to be.

240
00:14:39,954 --> 00:14:41,956
As he meant all men to be.

241
00:14:51,966 --> 00:14:55,094
You guys are disappointing God.

242
00:14:59,773 --> 00:15:03,193
Okay,
what if a cannibal was on death row?

243
00:15:03,610 --> 00:15:05,487
I guess for being a cannibal.

244
00:15:06,196 --> 00:15:10,533
And he orders Chinese for his last meal,
does he get to eat a Chinese guy?

245
00:15:12,952 --> 00:15:14,037
No.

246
00:15:14,913 --> 00:15:17,165
What if they
just electrocuted a Chinese guy...

247
00:15:17,332 --> 00:15:19,000
and the cannibal was next?

248
00:15:20,251 --> 00:15:21,669
No.

249
00:15:22,670 --> 00:15:25,006
- He'd already be cooked.
- Stop it.

250
00:15:27,675 --> 00:15:30,178
- Hey.
- Hey, where have you been?

251
00:15:30,345 --> 00:15:33,306
- I had a date with Mia.
- That was two nights ago.

252
00:15:33,473 --> 00:15:36,768
Yeah, well,
I stopped off in Vegas on the way home.

253
00:15:36,935 --> 00:15:38,603
Why?

254
00:15:38,770 --> 00:15:43,108
Because that's where you go
after you destroy a relationship.

255
00:15:43,817 --> 00:15:46,736
Oh, now I understand
why Mia's been calling.

256
00:15:46,903 --> 00:15:50,406
- She sounded pretty upset.
- I didn't tell her anything.

257
00:15:51,157 --> 00:15:52,909
But you'd tell Rose, wouldn't you?

258
00:15:53,284 --> 00:15:54,786
Hey, you just paid me once.

259
00:15:54,953 --> 00:15:57,789
Rose has me
on something called a "retainer. "

260
00:16:00,333 --> 00:16:02,919
- So, what happened with Mia?
- No big deal.

261
00:16:03,086 --> 00:16:05,672
I just got tired
of trying to be something I'm not.

262
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:08,633
- A decent, healthy human being?
- Pretty much.

263
00:16:11,678 --> 00:16:13,847
He's back.

264
00:16:14,013 --> 00:16:17,934
You're damn right I'm back.
Mia and I are through.

265
00:16:18,101 --> 00:16:21,396
You schmuck. She was the best thing
that ever happened to you.

266
00:16:21,563 --> 00:16:23,314
But you said I was whipped.

267
00:16:23,481 --> 00:16:26,401
I didn't mean dump her,
I meant grow a pair.

268
00:16:28,903 --> 00:16:30,530
What is "whipped"?

269
00:16:30,697 --> 00:16:33,908
When a man lets a woman take over
his life and tell him what to do.

270
00:16:34,075 --> 00:16:36,077
Oh, so like you and Mom.

271
00:16:39,747 --> 00:16:40,790
No.

272
00:16:45,628 --> 00:16:47,547
Oh, hi, Mother.

273
00:16:47,714 --> 00:16:50,425
No, no, Mia's not here.
He broke up with her.

274
00:16:51,217 --> 00:16:54,262
Yeah, schmuck seems to be
the general consensus.

275
00:16:54,971 --> 00:16:57,765
- What's a "schmuck"?
- Any guy who's not whipped.

276
00:16:57,932 --> 00:17:01,102
- She wants to talk to you.
- Well, I don't wanna talk to her.

277
00:17:01,686 --> 00:17:03,104
Nice catch, schmuck.

278
00:17:08,234 --> 00:17:09,485
Hi, Mom.

279
00:17:11,654 --> 00:17:14,282
Why am I the bad guy here?

280
00:17:14,449 --> 00:17:18,369
Well, did you ever stop to consider
that maybe this wasn't my fault?

281
00:17:18,536 --> 00:17:20,788
I gotta go, Mom,
my meat connection's here.

282
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:28,630
It's just weird. I just think that if the guy's
got a front door, we should use it.

283
00:17:28,796 --> 00:17:30,673
- This is fine.
- Okay.

284
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:33,718
- Hi, Charlie.
- Hello, Rose. What's going on?

285
00:17:34,385 --> 00:17:38,389
Well, I just wanted to introduce you
to Gordon, my new boyfriend.

286
00:17:38,848 --> 00:17:41,684
Oh, no kidding. Hi, Gordon.

287
00:17:41,851 --> 00:17:43,019
Hello.

288
00:17:43,186 --> 00:17:45,897
Gordon and l
are in a committed relationship.

289
00:17:46,064 --> 00:17:47,607
- Right, Gordon?
- Yeah, I guess.

290
00:17:47,774 --> 00:17:50,234
Look, see,
there's stairs right over there. Just—

291
00:17:50,401 --> 00:17:52,153
Anyway...

292
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:54,113
I was thinking that you and Mia...

293
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:57,617
would like to join us for dinner
one night. You know, double date.

294
00:17:58,409 --> 00:18:01,037
Oh, well, that's nice, Rose,
but I broke up with Mia.

295
00:18:01,996 --> 00:18:04,999
Oh, I see.

296
00:18:05,291 --> 00:18:07,001
Well, then goodbye, Gordon.

297
00:18:21,857 --> 00:18:24,443
I think I made a big mistake.

298
00:18:24,610 --> 00:18:26,362
I know the feeling.

299
00:18:26,529 --> 00:18:30,616
I once ate an egg salad sandwich
I left in my desk over the weekend.

300
00:18:32,159 --> 00:18:34,161
Huge mistake.

301
00:18:34,829 --> 00:18:36,288
My relationship with Mia...

302
00:18:36,455 --> 00:18:39,500
was the best thing that happened
to me and I threw it away.

303
00:18:39,875 --> 00:18:42,545
That's what I should have done
with the sandwich.

304
00:18:43,629 --> 00:18:45,923
I wonder if it's too late to fix things.

305
00:18:46,090 --> 00:18:47,883
Call her and find out.

306
00:18:48,050 --> 00:18:50,428
But if I do,
I'll be right back where I started...

307
00:18:50,594 --> 00:18:52,930
trying to be somebody I'm not.

308
00:18:53,097 --> 00:18:54,974
Okay, then find another girlfriend.

309
00:18:55,141 --> 00:18:58,352
I don't want another girlfriend.
I want Mia.

310
00:18:58,519 --> 00:19:00,479
Then call her.

311
00:19:00,813 --> 00:19:02,606
I can't.

312
00:19:02,773 --> 00:19:05,568
I can't live with her,
I can't live without her.

313
00:19:05,734 --> 00:19:10,406
If your plane crashed in the Andes
and she died, could you eat her?

314
00:19:23,210 --> 00:19:25,421
Mia, it's Charlie.

315
00:19:25,588 --> 00:19:29,967
Look, you win. I'll change.
No more meat, I promise.

316
00:19:32,469 --> 00:19:35,055
Come on, Mia.
Come out and smell me.

317
00:19:36,849 --> 00:19:40,227
Mia's not here.
Do I have to smell you?

318
00:19:40,811 --> 00:19:42,646
- Who are you?
- Ginger.

319
00:19:42,813 --> 00:19:44,190
So you're Charlie.

320
00:19:44,356 --> 00:19:48,152
- Yeah, where's Mia?
- Hang on a minute.

321
00:19:48,819 --> 00:19:51,864
She told me to give you this
if you stopped by.

322
00:19:54,783 --> 00:19:56,952
She took a job in New York?
Why'd she do that?

323
00:19:57,119 --> 00:19:58,495
Just read the note.

324
00:19:59,163 --> 00:20:02,458
"l love you too much to try to make you
into something you're not...

325
00:20:02,625 --> 00:20:06,295
and I love me too much
to settle for who you are. "

326
00:20:06,462 --> 00:20:08,964
That's the part
that always makes me cry.

327
00:20:10,883 --> 00:20:13,385
I can change her mind.
I'll fly to New York tonight.

328
00:20:13,552 --> 00:20:15,471
- Do you have her address?
- Come on in.

329
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:19,141
- Can I get you something to drink?
- No, thanks.

330
00:20:19,558 --> 00:20:21,644
Hi, American Airlines,
reservations please.

331
00:20:21,810 --> 00:20:24,146
You sure? I got all my boys here.

332
00:20:24,313 --> 00:20:26,190
Jack, Johnnie and Jose.

333
00:20:26,357 --> 00:20:29,818
Maybe a poquito Jose.

334
00:20:31,445 --> 00:20:32,988
Are these actual baby back ribs?

335
00:20:33,155 --> 00:20:35,824
- Yeah, help yourself.
- Thanks.

336
00:20:37,368 --> 00:20:40,579
I'd like to make a reservation
on the redeye to New Y ork tonight.

337
00:20:40,746 --> 00:20:44,208
Hey, do you mind if I turn on the TV?
I've got some money on the Lakers.

338
00:20:44,375 --> 00:20:46,543
- You bet sports?
- I'll bet anything.

339
00:20:46,710 --> 00:20:49,296
I had 200 bucks
on my sister's pregnancy test.

340
00:20:50,965 --> 00:20:52,466
How exactly do you know Mia?

341
00:20:52,633 --> 00:20:56,679
Oh, we used to do the ballet thing
together but I didn't have the discipline.

342
00:20:57,137 --> 00:21:01,016
- No kidding.
- I still dance, but just for tips.

343
00:21:03,102 --> 00:21:04,228
I'll call you back.

344
00:21:09,024 --> 00:21:11,568
You know, I'm thinking
she probably needs her space.

345
00:21:11,735 --> 00:21:12,945
Probably.

346
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:16,323
- Mind if I hang out and watch the game?
- Be my guest.

347
00:21:22,246 --> 00:21:25,541
If you got cash,
I could give you a lap dance at halftime.

348
00:21:28,752 --> 00:21:30,754
That'd be swell.
