1
00:00:02,852 --> 00:00:05,974
Alan, I forgot my toothbrush.
Can I use yours?

2
00:00:06,149 --> 00:00:08,143
Oh, dear Lord, no.

3
00:00:08,319 --> 00:00:10,397
Do you have any idea
how many bacteria...

4
00:00:10,573 --> 00:00:12,532
can be transferred
on a toothbrush?

5
00:00:12,702 --> 00:00:13,948
I don't know. How many?

6
00:00:14,121 --> 00:00:16,530
Okay, I don't know
the actual amount.

7
00:00:16,709 --> 00:00:18,916
Then why did you bring it up?

8
00:00:20,173 --> 00:00:21,751
Poor judgment.

9
00:00:21,926 --> 00:00:24,882
The point is, sharing these things
is a bad idea.

10
00:00:25,056 --> 00:00:28,225
Are you saying you don't want
your toothbrush in my mouth—?

11
00:00:28,395 --> 00:00:33,060
I know, I know.
I get the hypocrisy. Just humor me.

12
00:00:33,236 --> 00:00:37,451
Okay, I have hard,
medium or soft bristles.

13
00:00:37,619 --> 00:00:39,447
I have straight or curved handles.

14
00:00:39,622 --> 00:00:41,532
And for your flossing needs...

15
00:00:41,709 --> 00:00:45,045
I have waxed, mint-waxed,
un-waxed.

16
00:00:45,215 --> 00:00:49,001
If you're feeling especially adventurous,
may I suggest the cinnamon?

17
00:00:49,639 --> 00:00:51,597
Maybe I'll just wait till I get home.

18
00:00:51,767 --> 00:00:54,604
No, no. One day you skip brushing
and before you know it...

19
00:00:54,772 --> 00:00:58,226
your teeth rot away and you're
begging strangers to start your apple.

20
00:00:58,946 --> 00:01:01,236
Fine. I'll take the pink one.

21
00:01:02,786 --> 00:01:05,824
I always wondered, what's
the rubber thing at the end for?

22
00:01:05,999 --> 00:01:07,245
It's to massage your gums.

23
00:01:07,418 --> 00:01:11,039
Oh, I thought it might be an eraser.

24
00:01:11,217 --> 00:01:13,626
But who writes
when they're brushing their teeth?

25
00:01:15,432 --> 00:01:16,975
I don't know.

26
00:01:18,854 --> 00:01:19,886
What's the matter?

27
00:01:20,065 --> 00:01:22,854
Oh, nothing. Nothing.
Well, I kind of have to pee.

28
00:01:23,028 --> 00:01:25,865
- Go ahead.
- Oh, no, I'll wait till you're finished.

29
00:01:26,033 --> 00:01:28,952
Are you shy about peeing
in front of me? Because, Alan—

30
00:01:29,121 --> 00:01:31,281
Again, I get the hypocrisy.

31
00:01:32,001 --> 00:01:35,289
I think it's important to keep
a little mystery in a relationship.

32
00:01:35,465 --> 00:01:36,747
It's just peeing, Alan.

33
00:01:36,926 --> 00:01:38,469
Not necessarily.

34
00:01:38,637 --> 00:01:41,344
Sometimes when a man urinates...

35
00:01:41,517 --> 00:01:45,138
other muscles see that
as a green light to relax.

36
00:01:45,315 --> 00:01:47,190
So you've never peed
in front of a girl?

37
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:50,399
Well, my ex-wife, but after six,
seven years of marriage...

38
00:01:50,574 --> 00:01:52,069
who gives a damn anymore?

39
00:01:53,162 --> 00:01:55,619
- Okay, I'll brush out here.
- Thank you.

40
00:02:00,674 --> 00:02:03,677
- What?
- One of my teeth hurts when I brush it.

41
00:02:03,846 --> 00:02:05,924
When was the last time
you saw a dentist?

42
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:07,928
Alan, I see people all the time.

43
00:02:08,103 --> 00:02:10,857
They don't always tell you
what they do.

44
00:02:12,987 --> 00:02:16,939
Hey, are you done?
Because I gotta rinse.

45
00:02:17,119 --> 00:02:20,822
No, I can't go
when I know you're listening.

46
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,873
Would it help if I sang
the pee-pee song?

47
00:02:24,381 --> 00:02:27,052
- The what?
- My mom used to sing it to me.

48
00:02:27,219 --> 00:02:32,513
Tinkle, tinkle, little star
In the potty not the car

49
00:02:32,686 --> 00:02:37,482
Up above the bowl so high
Like the raindrops in the sky

50
00:02:37,653 --> 00:02:40,062
Hey, hey, it's working.

51
00:02:41,827 --> 00:02:43,370
Green light.

52
00:02:57,102 --> 00:02:59,642
Okay, okay. Stop, stop, stop.

53
00:02:59,815 --> 00:03:02,105
- Should I try it again?
- Not yet.

54
00:03:02,278 --> 00:03:04,070
Okay, now.

55
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:06,364
Okay, stop, stop, stop.

56
00:03:06,535 --> 00:03:07,734
Morning.

57
00:03:07,912 --> 00:03:10,155
- Morning.
- Morning, Charlie.

58
00:03:10,333 --> 00:03:11,365
Need any help?

59
00:03:12,378 --> 00:03:14,917
Do you know how to get
a 1981 Plymouth Duster moving?

60
00:03:15,091 --> 00:03:18,758
Y eah, yank out the eight track
and push it off a cliff.

61
00:03:20,683 --> 00:03:22,095
You're useless.

62
00:03:22,311 --> 00:03:23,972
Sorry.

63
00:03:24,147 --> 00:03:27,234
- You got a little grease on your face.
- Where?

64
00:03:27,403 --> 00:03:28,684
Cheek.

65
00:03:29,782 --> 00:03:30,814
Did I get it?

66
00:03:30,992 --> 00:03:32,072
No, other side.

67
00:03:33,663 --> 00:03:35,990
- Now?
- Little on your forehead.

68
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:39,330
- Yeah?
- Perfect.

69
00:03:39,507 --> 00:03:41,584
Now sing "Swanee River. "

70
00:03:42,637 --> 00:03:44,678
Alan, should I try it again?

71
00:03:44,849 --> 00:03:46,392
No. I'm gonna call AAA.

72
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:50,145
Good. No sense drinking over this.

73
00:03:58,288 --> 00:04:00,781
You must be so proud.

74
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:04,081
Hey, she may not be sophisticated,
but she's street-smart.

75
00:04:04,256 --> 00:04:06,666
Sesame Street-smart.

76
00:04:06,844 --> 00:04:07,876
Just leave it alone.

77
00:04:08,054 --> 00:04:11,141
Let me ask you something.
Have you stopped to consider...

78
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:14,396
the long-term cost of a relationship
with a girl that young?

79
00:04:14,565 --> 00:04:15,895
Charlie, it's a free tow.

80
00:04:16,068 --> 00:04:19,190
Oh, sure. That's how it always starts,
with a free tow.

81
00:04:19,365 --> 00:04:21,858
But who's gonna pay to fix the car
after it's towed?

82
00:04:23,622 --> 00:04:27,243
"Um" is right, my dim-witted friend.

83
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:28,999
And that's just the beginning.

84
00:04:29,173 --> 00:04:31,250
Girls like Kandi need
all kinds of stuff...

85
00:04:31,427 --> 00:04:35,379
the only way they can pay for it
is through horny morons like you.

86
00:04:35,559 --> 00:04:37,767
Her car breaks down
and I should just dump her?

87
00:04:37,938 --> 00:04:40,347
- This is a short-term relationship?
- I don't know.

88
00:04:40,525 --> 00:04:42,484
Trust me,
it's a short-term relationship.

89
00:04:42,654 --> 00:04:45,111
Kandi's not the brightest bulb
in the chandelier...

90
00:04:45,283 --> 00:04:46,944
but even she's gonna wake up...

91
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,076
wonder what she's doing
shacked up with a penniless putz...

92
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:51,365
who's twice her age.

93
00:04:51,544 --> 00:04:52,624
Kandi's not like that.

94
00:04:52,796 --> 00:04:53,995
Just wait.

95
00:04:54,173 --> 00:04:57,379
Your first minor stroke and she'll be
boinking the cardiologist...

96
00:04:57,554 --> 00:05:00,759
before you can scrawl
"What happened? " on your note pad.

97
00:05:05,025 --> 00:05:06,769
Okay, for the sake of argument...

98
00:05:06,945 --> 00:05:09,271
Iet's say you're right,
what's your point?

99
00:05:10,033 --> 00:05:13,369
My point is, you don't dry-clean
a rented tuxedo.

100
00:05:13,539 --> 00:05:15,284
You don't redecorate a hotel room.

101
00:05:15,459 --> 00:05:17,916
You don't order cable
for a port-a-potty...

102
00:05:18,088 --> 00:05:20,213
unless you're really, really drunk.

103
00:05:20,384 --> 00:05:22,544
And you don't take
on the bills of a girl...

104
00:05:22,721 --> 00:05:26,342
that's got the attention span of
a monkey chewing on a fly swatter.

105
00:05:27,062 --> 00:05:29,352
Okay, I appreciate your...

106
00:05:29,524 --> 00:05:33,227
how shall I describe it,
compassionate advice...

107
00:05:33,406 --> 00:05:37,026
but all I'm doing here
is arranging a free tow for a friend.

108
00:05:41,962 --> 00:05:45,713
Alan, I don't think
the engine's flooded anymore.

109
00:05:47,888 --> 00:05:50,297
- Fire extinguisher?
- Under the sink.

110
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:00,864
Hey, if you don't hurry up,
you'll be late.

111
00:06:01,035 --> 00:06:02,067
I don't mind.

112
00:06:02,246 --> 00:06:04,156
Okay, well, that takes
the pressure off.

113
00:06:04,332 --> 00:06:06,576
How come my dad's not bringing me?

114
00:06:06,753 --> 00:06:09,709
- He's helping Kandi get her car fixed.
- Oh, jeez.

115
00:06:09,883 --> 00:06:13,219
And him already broker
than a headless hooker.

116
00:06:13,389 --> 00:06:15,383
Hey, how come my mom hates Kandi?

117
00:06:16,812 --> 00:06:18,770
What gave you the idea
she hates her?

118
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:21,018
Because she says so.

119
00:06:21,486 --> 00:06:22,518
A lot.

120
00:06:23,531 --> 00:06:25,442
All right. Why do you think?

121
00:06:26,119 --> 00:06:28,029
I don't know.
She's pretty, she's fun...

122
00:06:28,206 --> 00:06:30,247
and Dad seems real happy with her.

123
00:06:30,418 --> 00:06:33,504
Well, little man, you just answered
your own question.

124
00:06:33,673 --> 00:06:35,252
I did? What'd I say?

125
00:06:37,054 --> 00:06:39,594
It's like this.
You ever see a kid at school...

126
00:06:39,767 --> 00:06:42,686
who doesn't like his lunch
but he won't let you have it?

127
00:06:42,855 --> 00:06:44,600
Oh, yeah, Russell Beasley.

128
00:06:44,775 --> 00:06:48,229
He'll spit on his apple cobbler
before he'll let anybody else eat it.

129
00:06:48,406 --> 00:06:51,908
This is pretty much the same deal,
except your mom is Russell Beasley...

130
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:55,035
and your dad
is the spit-covered cobbler.

131
00:06:55,961 --> 00:06:57,040
I don't understand.

132
00:06:57,588 --> 00:06:59,463
Though your mom
doesn't want your dad...

133
00:06:59,633 --> 00:07:02,043
she doesn't want Kandi
to eat him either.

134
00:07:05,017 --> 00:07:07,937
You know,
I like cobbler with ice cream.

135
00:07:08,690 --> 00:07:10,731
Way to follow a train of thought.

136
00:07:10,944 --> 00:07:12,737
Thanks.

137
00:07:13,782 --> 00:07:15,860
Well, I guess we should go
to school now.

138
00:07:16,036 --> 00:07:17,911
Couldn't hurt.

139
00:07:18,081 --> 00:07:20,870
I'll see if I can find my books.

140
00:07:22,129 --> 00:07:23,161
Sweet kid.

141
00:07:23,799 --> 00:07:25,211
Yeah.

142
00:07:25,385 --> 00:07:28,590
Shame he'll never be anything
more than a burden to society.

143
00:07:33,231 --> 00:07:34,976
Do you know a good lawyer, Alan?

144
00:07:35,151 --> 00:07:37,441
No, but my ex-wife does.

145
00:07:38,991 --> 00:07:40,866
- Why?
- Because I wanna sue the guy...

146
00:07:41,036 --> 00:07:42,448
who sold me that lemming.

147
00:07:44,041 --> 00:07:46,082
- You mean lemon.
- I do?

148
00:07:47,756 --> 00:07:49,334
Okay.

149
00:07:49,968 --> 00:07:53,588
Did you get any kind of a written
guarantee when you bought it?

150
00:07:53,766 --> 00:07:57,267
No, it was more of an oral agreement.

151
00:08:01,237 --> 00:08:04,074
All right, Mr. Harper,
I looked at your daughter's vehicle.

152
00:08:04,242 --> 00:08:06,034
She's not my daughter.

153
00:08:09,876 --> 00:08:10,908
Good for you.

154
00:08:12,881 --> 00:08:14,875
Anyway,
the prognosis looks rather bleak.

155
00:08:15,051 --> 00:08:17,758
- I understand.
- I mean, the vehicle was on fire.

156
00:08:17,973 --> 00:08:19,682
I know.

157
00:08:19,851 --> 00:08:21,014
What, is she like 21?

158
00:08:23,482 --> 00:08:25,690
- Twenty-two.
- And a half.

159
00:08:27,238 --> 00:08:28,782
Good for you.

160
00:08:29,617 --> 00:08:31,658
- Yeah, what about the car?
- Oh, the car?

161
00:08:31,829 --> 00:08:34,203
The cars gotta be 25, 26 years old.

162
00:08:35,043 --> 00:08:37,618
- I mean, can it be fixed?
- Anything can be fixed.

163
00:08:37,798 --> 00:08:40,635
Hell, they put a pig's heart
in my Uncle Vinnie.

164
00:08:41,554 --> 00:08:44,047
- How much?
- All of it.

165
00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:50,684
My Aunt Phyllis likes to call him
the other white meat now.

166
00:08:51,487 --> 00:08:53,814
No, I mean how much to fix the car?

167
00:08:54,409 --> 00:08:55,988
For you, three grand.

168
00:08:56,204 --> 00:08:57,533
What?

169
00:08:57,706 --> 00:09:00,793
Once again, the car was on fire.

170
00:09:01,003 --> 00:09:03,840
I had to wait an hour
before I could even touch it.

171
00:09:04,008 --> 00:09:05,919
But I only paid 800 for it.

172
00:09:06,095 --> 00:09:08,054
Eight hundred dollars?

173
00:09:08,224 --> 00:09:12,390
I hate to be the bearer of sad tidings,
but some business person...

174
00:09:12,564 --> 00:09:15,140
has taken advantage
of your good nature.

175
00:09:15,361 --> 00:09:17,688
Boy, that happens a lot.

176
00:09:18,783 --> 00:09:20,658
Well, 3000 is out of the question.

177
00:09:20,828 --> 00:09:23,118
It'd make more sense
just to get her a new car.

178
00:09:23,291 --> 00:09:24,750
Oh, Alan, thank you.

179
00:09:24,918 --> 00:09:28,420
That's the sweetest thing
anybody's ever done for me.

180
00:09:29,217 --> 00:09:31,010
Good for you.

181
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:37,636
- Hi.
- Hey.

182
00:09:38,107 --> 00:09:39,900
Why isn't your car in the garage?

183
00:09:40,069 --> 00:09:42,229
I loaned it to Kandi.

184
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:46,277
And how much are you paying
to fix hers?

185
00:09:46,496 --> 00:09:49,036
For your information, nothing.

186
00:09:49,209 --> 00:09:50,289
Nothing?

187
00:09:50,461 --> 00:09:51,577
Not a cent.

188
00:09:52,924 --> 00:09:55,416
I'm leasing her a Saturn.

189
00:09:57,014 --> 00:09:59,637
Tell me again about the free tow,
Alan.

190
00:09:59,810 --> 00:10:01,305
Come on, she needs a car...

191
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:04,317
and the lease terms
are surprisingly reasonable.

192
00:10:04,485 --> 00:10:06,609
They're practically giving them away.

193
00:10:07,406 --> 00:10:08,985
Excuse me.

194
00:10:09,493 --> 00:10:10,822
Where are you going?

195
00:10:10,996 --> 00:10:12,871
I'm gonna solve all your problems.

196
00:10:14,376 --> 00:10:16,951
Wanna see it coming
or should I surprise you?

197
00:10:19,259 --> 00:10:20,921
You're not funny.

198
00:10:25,937 --> 00:10:27,432
Hello?

199
00:10:27,899 --> 00:10:29,727
Hang on a second.

200
00:10:30,153 --> 00:10:33,987
It's your dentist, he wants to talk
to you about Kandi's teeth.

201
00:10:35,912 --> 00:10:37,076
Thank you.

202
00:10:40,587 --> 00:10:41,750
Hi, Dr. Weinberger.

203
00:10:41,922 --> 00:10:44,047
Thanks for seeing her
on such short notice.

204
00:10:46,639 --> 00:10:48,348
Can I have some privacy, please?

205
00:10:48,558 --> 00:10:51,312
Sure, get your own place.

206
00:10:56,655 --> 00:10:59,943
No, she's not covered
under my dental plan.

207
00:11:01,038 --> 00:11:03,162
Twenty-two and a half.

208
00:11:03,918 --> 00:11:05,911
Yeah, yeah, good for me.

209
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:08,457
Did you get a chance
to look at her tooth?

210
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:12,513
Oh, a root canal.

211
00:11:12,682 --> 00:11:14,475
Well, how much is that?

212
00:11:18,484 --> 00:11:20,976
What do you mean there's more?

213
00:11:21,530 --> 00:11:24,284
Who told you
to look at her wisdom teeth?

214
00:11:25,704 --> 00:11:28,411
That girl's got wisdom teeth?

215
00:11:28,584 --> 00:11:30,958
Okay, what's the worst thing
that could happen...

216
00:11:31,130 --> 00:11:32,791
if you don't take them out?

217
00:11:33,884 --> 00:11:35,962
How infected?

218
00:11:37,182 --> 00:11:41,396
All right, if it has to be done,
it has to be done.

219
00:11:41,856 --> 00:11:44,265
Yeah, send me the bill.

220
00:11:45,153 --> 00:11:47,028
Okay, bye-bye.

221
00:11:53,334 --> 00:11:54,533
Here.

222
00:11:54,836 --> 00:11:56,961
Aim for the cheap seats.

223
00:12:19,711 --> 00:12:21,752
Alan, what are you doing?

224
00:12:23,509 --> 00:12:26,429
You know,
a little bit of a cash-flow crunch...

225
00:12:26,598 --> 00:12:28,924
and I thought I'd use this
to pay some bills.

226
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:30,551
I see.

227
00:12:30,771 --> 00:12:32,397
Mind helping me out?

228
00:12:33,109 --> 00:12:34,224
Sure.

229
00:12:45,922 --> 00:12:48,628
Promise me you'll spend it on food,
not whiskey.

230
00:12:49,761 --> 00:12:51,755
My pain brings you
a lot of pleasure, huh?

231
00:12:51,932 --> 00:12:54,140
I'm a simple man.

232
00:13:00,696 --> 00:13:01,895
It's your ex-wife.

233
00:13:02,074 --> 00:13:04,649
Oh, perfect. Get the bat.

234
00:13:05,997 --> 00:13:07,196
This is the bat.

235
00:13:09,837 --> 00:13:11,665
Hello?

236
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:15,342
Oh, good. I was hoping it'd be you.

237
00:13:16,682 --> 00:13:19,720
Of course I remember the Alamo.

238
00:13:20,438 --> 00:13:23,560
Oh, you mean alimony.

239
00:13:24,945 --> 00:13:28,531
I was thinking Davy Crockett,
Jim Bowie.

240
00:13:29,286 --> 00:13:33,618
Oh, come on, Judith,
why can't we share a few chuckles?

241
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:35,915
Oh, no, no, I agree.

242
00:13:36,089 --> 00:13:38,463
There's nothing chuckle-worthy
about a subpoena.

243
00:13:39,219 --> 00:13:41,047
Well, you know, I will tell you what.

244
00:13:41,223 --> 00:13:43,846
I will bring you the check
when I pick up Jake.

245
00:13:45,021 --> 00:13:46,564
I promise.

246
00:13:46,732 --> 00:13:48,524
Okay. Okay. Bye-bye.

247
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:52,525
You gotta pick up Jake.

248
00:13:53,076 --> 00:13:54,986
- Why?
- Because I don't have her money.

249
00:13:55,163 --> 00:13:57,869
It's in Kandi's mouth and Kandi's car.

250
00:13:58,042 --> 00:14:00,714
What about The Treasure
of the Sierra Madre over there?

251
00:14:02,133 --> 00:14:03,711
This? This is nothing.

252
00:14:03,886 --> 00:14:06,259
One car payment
and maybe a bikini wax.

253
00:14:06,432 --> 00:14:08,639
- Bikini wax?
- A girl's gotta keep those up.

254
00:14:08,811 --> 00:14:10,686
It's a landscaping issue.

255
00:14:11,607 --> 00:14:13,684
You just gotta buy me some time
with Judith.

256
00:14:13,861 --> 00:14:15,938
What are you gonna do
with more time?

257
00:14:16,114 --> 00:14:19,486
You can't sell your blood,
your ex-wife already took that.

258
00:14:19,662 --> 00:14:23,283
And if you sell your sperm,
what's the point in dating Kandi?

259
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:26,629
Well, for your information,
I do have other options.

260
00:14:26,799 --> 00:14:29,802
- Like what?
- I've been looking at part-time work.

261
00:14:29,971 --> 00:14:32,464
And I have some very promising
auctions on eBay.

262
00:14:32,642 --> 00:14:35,182
Oh, really? What are you auctioning?

263
00:14:35,355 --> 00:14:38,976
Well, a few rare books,
a couple of lithos, a set of golf clubs.

264
00:14:39,153 --> 00:14:40,898
Since when do you play golf?

265
00:14:41,115 --> 00:14:43,488
Well, technically, they're your clubs.

266
00:14:46,791 --> 00:14:48,037
You're stealing from me?

267
00:14:48,210 --> 00:14:50,002
Oh, come on, you only bought them...

268
00:14:50,171 --> 00:14:53,127
so you could go to Palm Springs
and pick up lesbians.

269
00:14:56,348 --> 00:14:57,380
This is ridiculous.

270
00:14:57,559 --> 00:14:59,886
Why don't you just ask me
to lend you some money?

271
00:15:00,063 --> 00:15:02,223
- Would you lend me money?
- Absolutely.

272
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:04,940
If I hadn't taken a bath
on the Super Bowl.

273
00:15:05,697 --> 00:15:08,321
Well, I need to do this by myself
anyway.

274
00:15:08,494 --> 00:15:10,238
You know, I still have my pride.

275
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:13,996
Wow, you really think that, huh?

276
00:15:14,170 --> 00:15:18,336
Well, it doesn't matter
as long as I have Kandi.

277
00:15:18,886 --> 00:15:21,379
She looks up to me,
she thinks I'm special.

278
00:15:21,557 --> 00:15:22,589
She thinks I'm smart.

279
00:15:22,768 --> 00:15:27,100
She thinks gazpacho
is Pinocchio's father.

280
00:15:30,322 --> 00:15:33,444
What can I say, Charlie?
I'm crazy about her.

281
00:15:35,581 --> 00:15:38,917
All right, I certainly don't wanna
stand in the way of your happiness.

282
00:15:39,087 --> 00:15:41,045
Thank you.

283
00:15:41,215 --> 00:15:42,841
- One question though.
- Yeah?

284
00:15:43,052 --> 00:15:44,547
What are you gonna tell Jake...

285
00:15:44,721 --> 00:15:47,261
when he notices
his change jug is gone?

286
00:15:47,684 --> 00:15:51,554
Oh, it'll be okay.
I left him a post-dated check.

287
00:15:52,192 --> 00:15:54,981
It'll be good
by the time he goes to college.

288
00:15:56,282 --> 00:15:59,736
Yeah, like that kid's going to college.

289
00:16:08,052 --> 00:16:11,055
- Perfect, just perfect.
- Judith, I know what you're thinking—

290
00:16:11,224 --> 00:16:13,717
I'll tell you what,
your brother's a little coward...

291
00:16:13,895 --> 00:16:16,518
who don't have guts
to face his responsibilities—

292
00:16:16,691 --> 00:16:18,851
There's more to this
than meets the eye.

293
00:16:19,029 --> 00:16:20,939
I suppose you're gonna explain it
to me.

294
00:16:21,115 --> 00:16:24,321
I'm gonna try if you'll calm down
for a minute and listen.

295
00:16:24,496 --> 00:16:26,537
- All right, I'm listening.
- Are you calm?

296
00:16:26,708 --> 00:16:28,501
I'm listening.

297
00:16:29,546 --> 00:16:33,297
Okay. You know why Alan's not here?
Because he's ashamed.

298
00:16:33,469 --> 00:16:36,638
- Well, he should be.
- Judith, that's not listening.

299
00:16:37,685 --> 00:16:40,142
He's ashamed because
no matter how hard he works...

300
00:16:40,314 --> 00:16:42,889
he just can't seem to get ahead.

301
00:16:43,194 --> 00:16:45,105
You know,
his business is falling apart.

302
00:16:45,281 --> 00:16:46,824
Really? He hasn't said anything.

303
00:16:46,992 --> 00:16:48,368
Because he's too proud.

304
00:16:48,536 --> 00:16:50,696
Poor guy lost all his chiropractic
walk-ins...

305
00:16:50,874 --> 00:16:52,702
to an unlicensed massage parlor...

306
00:16:52,877 --> 00:16:55,631
that opened up right between him
and the Jamba Juice.

307
00:16:55,799 --> 00:16:57,543
- You're kidding.
- I'm deadly serious.

308
00:16:57,718 --> 00:16:59,926
Who's gonna pay
to have their spine adjusted...

309
00:17:00,097 --> 00:17:04,098
when for half the price
they can get their dingus dusted?

310
00:17:04,605 --> 00:17:06,231
Well, I wouldn't know about that.

311
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:09,568
As it turns out,
I'm a bit of an expert.

312
00:17:11,116 --> 00:17:13,193
And I'm telling you,
he's going under.

313
00:17:13,370 --> 00:17:14,651
Oh, my God.

314
00:17:14,830 --> 00:17:16,575
- You know he took a part-time job?
- No.

315
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:18,246
But you didn't hear it from me.

316
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:20,877
And please,
please don't say anything to Jake.

317
00:17:21,049 --> 00:17:22,378
The last thing Alan wants...

318
00:17:22,552 --> 00:17:26,884
is to look like a failure in the eyes
of that little boy in there.

319
00:17:27,101 --> 00:17:29,309
Of course not.

320
00:17:29,605 --> 00:17:32,228
- I won't say a word.
- Thank you.

321
00:17:32,443 --> 00:17:34,354
Hey, where's Dad?

322
00:17:35,365 --> 00:17:36,908
Just go with Uncle Charlie.

323
00:17:37,702 --> 00:17:39,078
Okay.

324
00:17:40,749 --> 00:17:42,244
Why is Mom crying?

325
00:17:43,712 --> 00:17:45,706
Because I'm good.

326
00:17:47,343 --> 00:17:50,050
I'm very, very good.

327
00:17:54,313 --> 00:17:56,521
I'm really getting tired of pizza.

328
00:17:56,734 --> 00:17:59,653
Well, I'm off to work.

329
00:18:03,787 --> 00:18:05,164
Get used to it.

330
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:10,544
Enjoy your pizza.

331
00:18:10,716 --> 00:18:13,089
Alan, Alan, what are you doing?

332
00:18:13,262 --> 00:18:16,134
I swear to God, I'll get your alimony
as soon as possible.

333
00:18:16,308 --> 00:18:19,477
- No, please, don't worry about it.
- Really?

334
00:18:19,647 --> 00:18:21,273
Charlie told me what's going on.

335
00:18:21,442 --> 00:18:24,860
- I don't need the money right now.
- Really?

336
00:18:25,031 --> 00:18:27,820
I haven't mentioned it.
When my grandmother passed away...

337
00:18:27,995 --> 00:18:30,784
she left me
a pretty substantial inheritance.

338
00:18:30,958 --> 00:18:32,537
Really?

339
00:18:32,711 --> 00:18:35,085
In fact, I want you to have this.

340
00:18:37,511 --> 00:18:39,884
- Really?
- Pay me when you can.

341
00:18:40,056 --> 00:18:42,466
The important thing is
you get back on your feet.

342
00:18:44,105 --> 00:18:46,859
I'm so happy.

343
00:18:47,026 --> 00:18:48,403
Hi, Huggy Bear.

344
00:18:48,612 --> 00:18:50,939
Boy, I love the new car you got me.

345
00:18:51,117 --> 00:18:55,034
Hi, Mrs. Harper,
doesn't he look cute in a mustache?

346
00:19:01,008 --> 00:19:03,299
I'm so sad.

347
00:19:23,588 --> 00:19:25,332
How's that pride doing?

348
00:19:28,721 --> 00:19:30,929
Nice, they let you take a few home.

349
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:34,269
It's in lieu of health insurance.

350
00:19:34,690 --> 00:19:37,099
Did you know they actually have
a little machine...

351
00:19:37,277 --> 00:19:39,271
that shoots the cheese
into the crust?

352
00:19:39,448 --> 00:19:40,859
- ls that so?
- Yep.

353
00:19:41,034 --> 00:19:43,526
It's a little high-pressure gun.

354
00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:46,370
You can't kill yourself with it,
though.

355
00:19:47,419 --> 00:19:49,212
I tried.

356
00:19:50,383 --> 00:19:54,513
I gotta tell you something, Alan,
this is from the bottom of my heart.

357
00:19:54,932 --> 00:19:58,553
I think that you are the stupidest man
on the face of the Earth...

358
00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:01,139
but I admire your perseverance.

359
00:20:02,528 --> 00:20:05,282
You're gonna have
to talk into the other ear.

360
00:20:05,450 --> 00:20:07,278
This one's full of cheese.

361
00:20:17,386 --> 00:20:19,261
Is that my Huggy Bear?

362
00:20:19,431 --> 00:20:21,639
Yeah, it's him.

363
00:20:22,353 --> 00:20:23,468
Hey, guess what.

364
00:20:23,647 --> 00:20:25,522
You know my roommates Ellie
and Emmett?

365
00:20:25,692 --> 00:20:27,187
Yeah.

366
00:20:27,361 --> 00:20:29,770
Turns out they're not really
brother and sister...

367
00:20:29,949 --> 00:20:31,990
so they started sleeping together.

368
00:20:32,954 --> 00:20:34,117
Oh, that's lovely.

369
00:20:34,289 --> 00:20:36,663
Anyway, now they're gonna get
their own place...

370
00:20:36,835 --> 00:20:40,373
and I don't know how
I'm gonna pay the rent by myself.

371
00:20:43,555 --> 00:20:46,511
Oh, God, Kandi, I can't. I can't.
I'm all tapped out.

372
00:20:46,685 --> 00:20:50,472
All I have left to put on eBay
is a kidney or a lung.

373
00:20:50,650 --> 00:20:53,903
If I were you, I'd sell the kidney
because lungs don't grow back.

374
00:20:56,243 --> 00:20:57,358
I'm sorry, honey...

375
00:20:57,537 --> 00:21:00,873
you're just gonna have to handle
your living situation on your own.

376
00:21:01,043 --> 00:21:03,915
Okay. Hey, guess what else.

377
00:21:04,089 --> 00:21:09,051
You've got a loved one who needs
either an operation or bail?

378
00:21:09,933 --> 00:21:13,803
No, silly. I'm finished with the dentist
and my mouth is all better.

379
00:21:13,981 --> 00:21:15,524
See?

380
00:21:16,569 --> 00:21:19,655
Hey, I've got an idea.
Why don't you move in with me?

381
00:21:19,866 --> 00:21:21,527
Okay.

382
00:21:23,956 --> 00:21:26,663
I'm so screwed.
