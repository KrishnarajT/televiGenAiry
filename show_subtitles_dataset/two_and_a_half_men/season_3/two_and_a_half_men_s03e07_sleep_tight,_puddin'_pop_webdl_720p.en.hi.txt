1
00:00:03,062 --> 00:00:05,022
Oh, this is gonna be so great.

2
00:00:05,189 --> 00:00:07,441
Are you guys as excited as I am?

3
00:00:09,694 --> 00:00:11,320
Probably not.

4
00:00:11,487 --> 00:00:12,947
Okay.

5
00:00:33,009 --> 00:00:36,220
Oh, you have got to be kidding me.

6
00:00:36,387 --> 00:00:38,514
You guys are the best.

7
00:00:38,681 --> 00:00:40,474
Is this a chocolate fudge cake?

8
00:00:40,641 --> 00:00:42,518
You tell us, you brought it.

9
00:00:43,019 --> 00:00:45,062
Make a wish
and blow out the candles.

10
00:00:45,229 --> 00:00:46,897
Oh, right, right.

11
00:00:47,064 --> 00:00:49,025
I wish this was chocolate fudge.

12
00:00:51,944 --> 00:00:54,405
Okay, now it's time for party games.

13
00:00:54,572 --> 00:00:56,741
I've got one.

14
00:00:58,617 --> 00:01:03,247
It's called Drink Until This Night
Makes Some Sort of Sense.

15
00:01:03,622 --> 00:01:05,041
I'll go first.

16
00:01:09,879 --> 00:01:11,047
Nope, not yet.

17
00:01:11,756 --> 00:01:13,883
Round two.

18
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:23,309
Uncle Charlie?

19
00:01:23,476 --> 00:01:24,643
Go away.

20
00:01:25,561 --> 00:01:27,229
Have you seen my iPod?

21
00:01:27,396 --> 00:01:28,439
No.

22
00:01:28,898 --> 00:01:30,274
What about you, Rose?

23
00:01:33,611 --> 00:01:35,237
No. Sorry, Jake.

24
00:01:35,404 --> 00:01:38,074
Oh, man.

25
00:01:45,915 --> 00:01:48,959
Good morning, sleepyhead.

26
00:01:49,418 --> 00:01:51,420
Morning.

27
00:01:51,587 --> 00:01:53,339
So.

28
00:01:53,506 --> 00:01:55,883
What's new?

29
00:02:20,866 --> 00:02:23,368
That's good coffee.

30
00:02:24,953 --> 00:02:27,748
- Good morning.
- It's getting there.

31
00:02:29,916 --> 00:02:32,252
- Whose birthday cake?
- Rose.

32
00:02:32,419 --> 00:02:33,670
Oh, surprise party?

33
00:02:33,837 --> 00:02:36,506
No, I think she saw it coming.

34
00:02:38,467 --> 00:02:39,509
- Morning.
- Morning.

35
00:02:39,676 --> 00:02:41,136
Hey. Coffee?

36
00:02:41,303 --> 00:02:42,846
Can you make it to go?

37
00:02:43,305 --> 00:02:44,347
T o go?

38
00:02:44,514 --> 00:02:47,642
Yeah, the thing is,
I made a little boo-boo.

39
00:02:47,809 --> 00:02:49,311
- A boo-boo?
- A boo-boo.

40
00:02:50,604 --> 00:02:53,065
Anyway, I may have to leave town
for a few days.

41
00:02:54,149 --> 00:02:55,233
Why? What did you do?

42
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,444
Rose.

43
00:02:58,570 --> 00:02:59,613
What?

44
00:03:01,490 --> 00:03:03,950
I did Rose.

45
00:03:04,618 --> 00:03:07,329
Wait. You had sex with Rose?
Are you insane?

46
00:03:07,496 --> 00:03:09,122
Moot point, Alan.

47
00:03:09,289 --> 00:03:12,292
What I have to do is find my passport
and head for the border.

48
00:03:12,459 --> 00:03:16,046
What you have to do is tell Rose
that I was drunk and l' m sorry...

49
00:03:16,213 --> 00:03:20,759
and that there's no reason to hunt me
down and glue my testicles to my thigh.

50
00:03:21,176 --> 00:03:22,511
Again.

51
00:03:22,677 --> 00:03:26,556
I'll tell you now, you're swabbing on
your own nail polish remover this time.

52
00:03:26,723 --> 00:03:29,184
That wasn't pleasant
for either of us, Berta.

53
00:03:29,351 --> 00:03:31,853
- What the hell were you thinking?
- Thinking?

54
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:33,313
There was no thinking.

55
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:36,358
We had tequila shots,
were talking, having a nice evening...

56
00:03:36,525 --> 00:03:38,485
and somebody suggested
a sponge bath.

57
00:03:38,652 --> 00:03:41,238
- Somebody?
- lt might have been me.

58
00:03:41,404 --> 00:03:44,616
The next thing I know, Jake
is waking us up looking for his iPod.

59
00:03:44,783 --> 00:03:46,743
Wait, Jake saw you in bed with Rose?

60
00:03:48,036 --> 00:03:49,079
No.

61
00:03:50,789 --> 00:03:52,332
Oh, great, great. That's great.

62
00:03:52,499 --> 00:03:54,751
- What am I gonna tell him?
- Who cares? He's 11.

63
00:03:54,918 --> 00:03:56,837
He'll get over it.

64
00:03:57,003 --> 00:03:59,756
I'm the one who still has a bald patch
on my scrotum.

65
00:04:01,758 --> 00:04:05,679
And let me tell you,
the comb-over isn't fooling anybody.

66
00:04:06,972 --> 00:04:10,267
- Morning.
- Oh, hey, look, it's Rose.

67
00:04:10,433 --> 00:04:13,019
- Morning, Rose.
- Hey, birthday girl.

68
00:04:13,186 --> 00:04:14,938
You get anything good last night?

69
00:04:16,856 --> 00:04:18,316
It was a wonderful party.

70
00:04:18,483 --> 00:04:20,277
Isn't that nice.

71
00:04:20,443 --> 00:04:21,653
Can I get you anything?

72
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:25,031
Coffee, orange juice,
industrial strength adhesive?

73
00:04:26,241 --> 00:04:29,202
No, I can't stay.
I'm having a birthday lunch with my dad.

74
00:04:29,369 --> 00:04:32,163
Well, that's great.
Not that I'm anxious for you to leave.

75
00:04:32,330 --> 00:04:34,541
It's great you're gonna
spend time with dad.

76
00:04:35,166 --> 00:04:38,044
Dads are great. I like the word "dad"
better than "father. "

77
00:04:38,211 --> 00:04:41,131
If Hitler had called Germany
dadland instead of fatherland...

78
00:04:41,298 --> 00:04:43,341
it would have been
a friendlier country.

79
00:04:44,259 --> 00:04:45,552
- Charlie.
- Y es?

80
00:04:45,719 --> 00:04:47,512
- You're acting crazy.
- Am l?

81
00:04:47,679 --> 00:04:50,307
Hey, if anybody knows.

82
00:04:51,391 --> 00:04:54,019
I understand last night
was just one of those things.

83
00:04:54,185 --> 00:04:55,979
I have no expectations.

84
00:04:56,563 --> 00:04:58,398
Okay. Good.

85
00:04:58,565 --> 00:05:00,483
- And?
- And nothing.

86
00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:01,985
I'll see you later.

87
00:05:02,152 --> 00:05:04,654
- Bye, guys.
- Bye.

88
00:05:04,821 --> 00:05:07,073
Oh, God, it's worse than I thought.

89
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:09,451
What are you talking about?
She sounded fine.

90
00:05:09,617 --> 00:05:11,036
Berta, tell him.

91
00:05:11,202 --> 00:05:12,787
She's nuts, he's screwed.

92
00:05:19,002 --> 00:05:20,754
- Uncle Charlie?
- Yeah, buddy?

93
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:23,965
You know what would be cool?
If you and Rose got married.

94
00:05:24,132 --> 00:05:25,842
Yeah, Charlie, that would be cool.

95
00:05:27,927 --> 00:05:29,262
I could be the best man.

96
00:05:29,429 --> 00:05:33,350
Carry the ring for you
and the medication for her.

97
00:05:33,516 --> 00:05:35,435
Do pharmacies have bridal registries?

98
00:05:36,311 --> 00:05:38,813
Hey, have you guys talked
about having kids?

99
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:42,525
Are we gonna hear the pitter-patter
of teeny-weeny, crazy-ass feet?

100
00:05:46,529 --> 00:05:48,406
No, he's not gonna marry Rose.

101
00:05:48,573 --> 00:05:50,700
Why not?
He's already getting sex from her.

102
00:05:53,078 --> 00:05:56,122
Jake. Jake,
the only reason Rose was in my bed...

103
00:05:56,289 --> 00:05:58,333
is because she was
too tired to go home.

104
00:05:58,917 --> 00:06:02,420
Uncle Charlie, I'm an underachiever,
not an idiot.

105
00:06:06,216 --> 00:06:08,593
Okay, fine. You want the truth?

106
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:11,721
- Charlie, be discreet.
- Because a man and woman have sex...

107
00:06:11,888 --> 00:06:14,557
doesn't mean they get married
or they see each other.

108
00:06:14,724 --> 00:06:17,852
It doesn't even mean
they have to give their actual names.

109
00:06:18,812 --> 00:06:20,563
Thank you for your discretion.

110
00:06:21,147 --> 00:06:24,109
No, no. It's time somebody
taught him the facts of life.

111
00:06:24,275 --> 00:06:27,779
What facts? That you did a stupid thing
because you're a stupid man?

112
00:06:27,946 --> 00:06:29,280
I was getting to that.

113
00:06:29,447 --> 00:06:30,532
Why was it stupid?

114
00:06:30,698 --> 00:06:33,076
Because he had sex with someone
he doesn't love.

115
00:06:33,243 --> 00:06:35,203
No, no. Because I had sex
with someone...

116
00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:37,789
who knows how to disable
the alarm system.

117
00:06:39,457 --> 00:06:43,503
And who has no compunction
about shaving my head while I sleep.

118
00:06:44,129 --> 00:06:46,965
- What's a compunction?
- Go get ready for bed.

119
00:06:47,131 --> 00:06:48,299
Sounds dirty.

120
00:06:48,466 --> 00:06:50,009
Just go.

121
00:06:50,176 --> 00:06:53,972
Hey, lady,
I can see your compunction.

122
00:06:54,138 --> 00:06:55,974
- Charlie, do me a favor?
- What?

123
00:06:56,140 --> 00:06:57,934
- Don't talk to my kid about sex.
- Why?

124
00:06:58,101 --> 00:06:59,644
Because you're a pig.

125
00:07:00,603 --> 00:07:02,647
Okay.

126
00:07:03,898 --> 00:07:06,359
- What was that?
- What was what?

127
00:07:06,526 --> 00:07:08,403
It was a thump.

128
00:07:08,570 --> 00:07:10,989
- What do you mean a thump?
- You know, a thump.

129
00:07:11,155 --> 00:07:13,741
Like a woman dressed as a ninja
jumping from a tree...

130
00:07:13,908 --> 00:07:16,661
and landing on the roof
with cat-like precision.

131
00:07:17,787 --> 00:07:20,582
- I didn't hear anything.
- Well, I did.

132
00:07:20,748 --> 00:07:24,419
I guess your hearing's more acute
when your nuts are on the line.

133
00:07:27,338 --> 00:07:30,133
Come on, you don't really
think Rose is gonna do anything?

134
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:33,136
Hey, I never told you
half the weird stuff she pulled here.

135
00:07:33,595 --> 00:07:35,555
- Why not?
- We needed a babysitter...

136
00:07:35,722 --> 00:07:37,640
and I didn't want you
to get spooked.

137
00:07:39,809 --> 00:07:41,978
Okay, I'm listening.

138
00:07:42,645 --> 00:07:46,649
One time she trained a seagull
to swoop downâ€”

139
00:07:46,816 --> 00:07:49,319
Oh, God, this is it.

140
00:07:50,612 --> 00:07:55,116
Come on. I can not believe a grown man
like you is afraid of a little girl.

141
00:07:55,283 --> 00:07:58,453
A little girl with a big seagull.

142
00:07:59,078 --> 00:08:01,956
Went right for my eyes.

143
00:08:02,999 --> 00:08:06,961
You ever seen one of them swoop down
on a picnic table to grab a french fry?

144
00:08:07,128 --> 00:08:08,713
- lt was just like that.
- Charlie.

145
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:10,256
That's how she trained it.

146
00:08:10,423 --> 00:08:13,301
Took a picture of me
and put french fries all over it.

147
00:08:14,218 --> 00:08:15,428
You're being ridiculous.

148
00:08:18,348 --> 00:08:19,390
Am l?

149
00:08:20,767 --> 00:08:22,727
We'll see.

150
00:08:36,032 --> 00:08:38,368
- Are you Charlie Harper?
- Yes, I am.

151
00:08:38,534 --> 00:08:40,286
I'm Rose's father.

152
00:08:42,914 --> 00:08:44,791
I don't see a way out of this, do you?

153
00:08:52,256 --> 00:08:54,300
So you're Rose's dad.

154
00:08:57,512 --> 00:09:00,139
I can see the resemblance.

155
00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:04,977
You and I need to talk.

156
00:09:05,770 --> 00:09:07,563
Okay, sure, if you want.

157
00:09:07,730 --> 00:09:10,733
I'm booked for the next few days,
but maybe we can next week.

158
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:12,944
- Now.
- Or now.

159
00:09:13,111 --> 00:09:15,196
There's a window in my schedule.
Come on in.

160
00:09:15,363 --> 00:09:16,948
Thank you.

161
00:09:17,115 --> 00:09:19,367
- Can I get you something to drink?
- I'm fine.

162
00:09:19,534 --> 00:09:22,286
You don't mind if I have
a conversation starter, do you?

163
00:09:22,453 --> 00:09:24,205
- Knock yourself out.
- I'm gonna try.

164
00:09:30,169 --> 00:09:33,631
- So I'm Charlie's brother, Alan.
- Nice to meet you.

165
00:09:33,798 --> 00:09:35,675
Same here.

166
00:09:36,717 --> 00:09:39,720
I never slept with your daughter.

167
00:09:48,688 --> 00:09:50,398
I'm not surprised.

168
00:09:55,987 --> 00:09:57,738
Okay. Rose's dad.

169
00:09:57,905 --> 00:10:00,449
- Call me Harvey.
- Okay, Harvey.

170
00:10:00,616 --> 00:10:03,661
Easy. Like the invisible rabbit
in that Jimmy Stewart movie.

171
00:10:03,828 --> 00:10:06,080
- What was that called?
- Harvey.

172
00:10:07,290 --> 00:10:08,332
Right.

173
00:10:09,917 --> 00:10:11,168
Loved that movie.

174
00:10:11,335 --> 00:10:15,506
People don't know it was originally a play.
Then they tried to make it a musical.

175
00:10:15,673 --> 00:10:16,716
- Charlie?
- Y es, sir?

176
00:10:16,883 --> 00:10:19,176
- Sit down.
- Y es, sir.

177
00:10:19,844 --> 00:10:21,762
Now...

178
00:10:21,929 --> 00:10:24,265
what are your intentions
towards my daughter?

179
00:10:24,432 --> 00:10:27,435
Oh, right to the chase.
Straight shooter.

180
00:10:27,602 --> 00:10:29,979
I like that.

181
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:37,403
Thirsty.

182
00:10:39,113 --> 00:10:40,907
So where were we?

183
00:10:41,657 --> 00:10:44,410
He wants to know
what your intentions are towards Rose.

184
00:10:45,703 --> 00:10:47,872
Thank you.

185
00:10:49,916 --> 00:10:52,627
Well, I would have to say
that my intentions are good.

186
00:10:52,793 --> 00:10:54,795
Anybody who knows me
would confirm...

187
00:10:54,962 --> 00:10:57,965
that "Charlie Harper
has good intentions. "

188
00:10:58,132 --> 00:11:02,762
His actions, on the other hand,
are usually selfish and asinine.

189
00:11:03,846 --> 00:11:05,765
Again, thank you.

190
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:09,602
Harvey, I'm glad we had this chance
to talkâ€”

191
00:11:09,769 --> 00:11:11,312
- Sit down.
- Sorry.

192
00:11:11,479 --> 00:11:14,148
- You gonna marry my daughter or not?
- Not.

193
00:11:14,315 --> 00:11:16,984
- Not?
- A very well-intended not.

194
00:11:17,485 --> 00:11:22,657
So after two years together, you just
plan to keep on stringing her along?

195
00:11:22,823 --> 00:11:26,327
No, I would neverâ€”
Wait a minute, did you say two years?

196
00:11:26,494 --> 00:11:29,038
Now look, Rose cares very much
about you...

197
00:11:29,205 --> 00:11:30,831
and she's not gonna leave you.

198
00:11:30,998 --> 00:11:33,918
So I think the honorable thing
for you to do is let her go.

199
00:11:34,752 --> 00:11:37,088
Believe me, Harvey, I've tried.

200
00:11:38,422 --> 00:11:39,965
God, how I've tried.

201
00:11:41,258 --> 00:11:44,804
So, what's the problem?
You love her too much?

202
00:11:46,055 --> 00:11:47,515
Not exactly.

203
00:11:47,682 --> 00:11:50,684
I mean, she's a wonderful gal
and I do care for her.

204
00:11:50,851 --> 00:11:53,437
But you seeâ€”

205
00:11:53,604 --> 00:11:56,565
What, the peanut gallery taking
a break?

206
00:11:57,400 --> 00:12:00,069
Harvey, the truth is,
Charlie has tried to end it.

207
00:12:00,236 --> 00:12:02,613
But your daughter
doesn't handle rejection well.

208
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:04,031
Or all that legally.

209
00:12:06,033 --> 00:12:09,120
In my defense, we're not talking
about a long-term relationship.

210
00:12:09,286 --> 00:12:14,542
We're talking about a couple of nights
of drunken, frenzied sex two years apart.

211
00:12:14,708 --> 00:12:18,129
- That's your defense?
- I didn't say it was a good defense.

212
00:12:18,295 --> 00:12:20,172
You'll have to forgive my brother.

213
00:12:20,339 --> 00:12:23,426
He thinks with his penis
and his penis isn't very bright.

214
00:12:25,386 --> 00:12:29,223
That's true. Anybody
who knows me will confirm that.

215
00:12:30,391 --> 00:12:32,601
I can confirm that.

216
00:12:33,727 --> 00:12:36,605
Oh, for God sake.

217
00:12:38,315 --> 00:12:41,819
Rose, did you tell your father
we've been going out for two years?

218
00:12:41,986 --> 00:12:45,489
Yeah. I thought it sounded better
than saying we had a one-night stand...

219
00:12:45,656 --> 00:12:47,741
and then I stalked you
for two years.

220
00:12:47,908 --> 00:12:49,577
She's not wrong.

221
00:12:50,911 --> 00:12:53,747
Daddy, try to understand.

222
00:12:53,914 --> 00:12:56,250
I didn't want you to feel sorry for me...

223
00:12:56,417 --> 00:12:59,336
or try to set me up with anybody.
Or have me committed.

224
00:12:59,503 --> 00:13:02,590
Oh, sweetheart,
I would never do that.

225
00:13:02,756 --> 00:13:05,342
We're a wealthy family.
We can afford home care.

226
00:13:06,719 --> 00:13:10,347
Okay, well, I'm glad
we had this chance to clear the air.

227
00:13:10,514 --> 00:13:15,603
I'm sure you two have a lot to talk about
so I'll let you get to it.

228
00:13:17,563 --> 00:13:20,649
- Mom?
- Hang on, dear.

229
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:26,280
- Hello?
- Alan. Oh, good, I'm glad you're home.

230
00:13:27,990 --> 00:13:31,160
Listen, I'm in the neighborhood
and I know how Charlie hates it...

231
00:13:31,327 --> 00:13:36,790
when I just drop in unannounced,
so I thought I'd call first.

232
00:13:42,212 --> 00:13:44,340
I'll let him know.

233
00:13:45,716 --> 00:13:47,760
Charlie, Mom's coming over.

234
00:13:48,928 --> 00:13:50,304
Tell her I'm not here.

235
00:13:53,474 --> 00:13:56,060
Hi, sweetie. Oh, hello, Rose.

236
00:13:56,226 --> 00:13:59,396
Hi, Evelyn.
Daddy, this is Charlie's mom, Evelyn.

237
00:13:59,563 --> 00:14:03,108
- Evelyn, this is my father, Harvey.
- Harvey, nice to meet you.

238
00:14:03,943 --> 00:14:06,070
Nice to meet you.

239
00:14:11,158 --> 00:14:13,202
So, what are we talking about?

240
00:14:13,869 --> 00:14:16,330
Well, Charlie and I got hammered
last night...

241
00:14:16,497 --> 00:14:19,458
and then somebody suggested
a sponge bath.

242
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:21,418
It might have been me.

243
00:14:23,087 --> 00:14:25,255
Then we ended up
spending the night together.

244
00:14:26,006 --> 00:14:28,258
I see.

245
00:14:28,842 --> 00:14:32,805
Are you as proud of yours
as I am of mine?

246
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:38,602
You do the best you can
to raise them...

247
00:14:38,769 --> 00:14:41,855
but in the end they drive down
life's highway on their own.

248
00:14:42,022 --> 00:14:43,065
Isn't that the truth?

249
00:14:43,232 --> 00:14:47,361
I think God gives us children so death
won't come as such a disappointment.

250
00:14:53,367 --> 00:14:55,285
So, Evelyn...

251
00:14:55,452 --> 00:14:56,662
are you married?

252
00:14:57,496 --> 00:14:58,664
Not at the moment.

253
00:15:00,457 --> 00:15:02,751
Why? What do you have in mind?

254
00:15:02,918 --> 00:15:06,338
Well, maybe we could start
with a little dinner.

255
00:15:07,297 --> 00:15:08,424
Sounds good.

256
00:15:10,217 --> 00:15:12,678
But how do you wanna finish?

257
00:15:13,762 --> 00:15:16,348
Simultaneously.

258
00:15:18,517 --> 00:15:20,352
Oh, he's good.

259
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:31,280
Hello. Oh, hi, Mom.

260
00:15:31,447 --> 00:15:33,157
- Hold on. Alan?
- Yeah?

261
00:15:33,323 --> 00:15:35,534
Get the door.

262
00:15:38,412 --> 00:15:41,498
Boys, we have a problem.
We need to talk.

263
00:15:42,749 --> 00:15:45,002
- What's going on?
- We haven't seen you in days.

264
00:15:45,169 --> 00:15:47,921
- Not that we're complaining.
- Merely an observation.

265
00:15:48,088 --> 00:15:50,716
Well, as you know,
I have been seeing Rose's father.

266
00:15:50,883 --> 00:15:54,219
- And how's that going?
- At first it was wonderful.

267
00:15:54,386 --> 00:15:58,932
He was handsome, charming,
and a raging bull in the sack.

268
00:15:59,099 --> 00:16:01,685
No mental pictures. Push them out.

269
00:16:01,852 --> 00:16:04,188
Well, don't give them to me.

270
00:16:04,354 --> 00:16:05,564
What I didn't realize...

271
00:16:05,731 --> 00:16:10,903
is the man has the emotional stability
of a bag of rats in a burning meth lab.

272
00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:13,530
- What did he do?
- It's what he didn't do.

273
00:16:13,697 --> 00:16:16,033
- Okay, what didn't he do?
- Leave.

274
00:16:17,826 --> 00:16:20,746
Now, a couple of days
of Viagra-enhanced boinking...

275
00:16:20,913 --> 00:16:23,582
and he suddenly thinks
he lives with me.

276
00:16:23,749 --> 00:16:27,211
He's moving my furniture around,
he's getting his mail forwarded...

277
00:16:27,377 --> 00:16:29,463
he had a satellite dish installed.

278
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:31,340
Did he get the NFL package?

279
00:16:31,506 --> 00:16:33,967
Charlie, please, this is not funny.

280
00:16:34,384 --> 00:16:37,846
This man is obsessed with me.
He will not let me out of his sight.

281
00:16:38,013 --> 00:16:39,723
Wherever I go, there he is...

282
00:16:39,890 --> 00:16:42,351
with this stupid love-smitten look
on his face.

283
00:16:42,517 --> 00:16:44,561
You just wanna hit him with a shovel.

284
00:16:45,729 --> 00:16:47,981
Well, what do you want us to do?

285
00:16:48,148 --> 00:16:50,776
Come over to my house
and hit him with a shovel.

286
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:54,154
Wouldn't it be easier to keep
feeding him Viagra until he strokes?

287
00:16:54,321 --> 00:16:57,658
Charlie, don't be ridiculous.
That could take months.

288
00:16:58,158 --> 00:16:59,493
Come on now, guys, think.

289
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:02,245
How can I get this loon out
of my house?

290
00:17:02,412 --> 00:17:04,790
- I say we bring in expert help.
- Way ahead of you.

291
00:17:04,957 --> 00:17:06,833
Rose.

292
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,835
- Yes, Charlie?
- Road trip.

293
00:17:09,753 --> 00:17:13,131
Oh, goody, I'll meet you in the garage.

294
00:17:26,436 --> 00:17:28,522
- Daddy?
- Oh, Rose, good.

295
00:17:28,689 --> 00:17:30,649
You got my change-of-address card.

296
00:17:32,651 --> 00:17:35,028
And there's my other favorite gal.

297
00:17:35,195 --> 00:17:37,447
- Hello, Harvey.
- Where were you, pudding pop?

298
00:17:37,614 --> 00:17:39,366
I was worried sick.

299
00:17:39,533 --> 00:17:42,911
- I just went out.
- I didn't see you leave.

300
00:17:43,078 --> 00:17:45,831
That's because I climbed out
the laundry room window.

301
00:17:47,124 --> 00:17:48,959
Aren't you a limber little minx.

302
00:17:53,130 --> 00:17:55,132
Daddy, we need to talk.

303
00:17:55,298 --> 00:17:56,425
Yes, right away, honey.

304
00:17:56,591 --> 00:17:59,594
Hey, fellas,
are you ready for some football?

305
00:18:00,303 --> 00:18:03,807
Evie, why don't you get our guests
some cold drinks?

306
00:18:03,974 --> 00:18:05,517
Yes, of course, dear.

307
00:18:05,684 --> 00:18:08,311
Garden shed. Shovel. Bag of lime.

308
00:18:11,773 --> 00:18:15,652
- Daddy, listen to me very closely.
- Okay.

309
00:18:16,361 --> 00:18:17,654
You don't live here.

310
00:18:18,196 --> 00:18:20,657
Yes, I do. Look at me.

311
00:18:21,491 --> 00:18:23,618
We've been through this before,
remember?

312
00:18:24,327 --> 00:18:27,164
The pretty receptionist
at your psychiatrist's office?

313
00:18:27,330 --> 00:18:30,459
Oh, yeah. Cheryl.

314
00:18:30,625 --> 00:18:33,670
She had a mean lawyer.

315
00:18:34,463 --> 00:18:35,714
But this is different.

316
00:18:35,881 --> 00:18:38,300
Evelyn and I are in love,
we're gonna get married.

317
00:18:38,467 --> 00:18:39,843
Isn't that right?

318
00:18:40,010 --> 00:18:43,930
Not if you were the last crazy man
on Earth.

319
00:18:44,556 --> 00:18:46,475
Guys, feel free to call me Dad.

320
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:50,395
- No, thank you.
- I couldn't.

321
00:18:51,646 --> 00:18:53,607
Daddy, pay attention.

322
00:18:53,773 --> 00:18:55,442
Okay.

323
00:18:55,609 --> 00:18:59,821
I know what it feels like to be so in love
with someone you wanna crawl inside...

324
00:18:59,988 --> 00:19:03,283
so that you're wearing their skin
like a leotard with nipples.

325
00:19:06,995 --> 00:19:10,999
What I've learned is that not everyone
is ready for that kind of intimacy.

326
00:19:11,875 --> 00:19:13,585
Take me and Charlie for example.

327
00:19:13,752 --> 00:19:15,420
We slept together two years ago...

328
00:19:15,587 --> 00:19:19,007
realized we were better as friends,
and haven't done it again since.

329
00:19:21,051 --> 00:19:23,553
- We haven't?
- You were too drunk.

330
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:25,972
I was gonna tell you eventually.

331
00:19:26,139 --> 00:19:28,975
Then why did you let me think
we did?

332
00:19:29,142 --> 00:19:31,311
Because it doesn't make
any difference.

333
00:19:31,478 --> 00:19:33,021
I'm in this for the long haul.

334
00:19:35,273 --> 00:19:39,277
Sweetheart, when Evie and I get married
Charlie will be your stepbrother.

335
00:19:40,028 --> 00:19:42,030
Oh, I didn't think of that.

336
00:19:42,197 --> 00:19:44,074
Oh, trÃ¨s kinky.

337
00:19:44,658 --> 00:19:46,576
Rose, stick with the plan.

338
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:49,287
Okay.

339
00:19:49,788 --> 00:19:51,665
Daddy,
I didn't wanna have to do this...

340
00:19:51,831 --> 00:19:54,251
but I brought someone else here
to talk to you.

341
00:19:54,417 --> 00:19:57,420
- Who?
- Come on in, Grandma.

342
00:19:59,673 --> 00:20:01,758
You brought Mother?

343
00:20:01,925 --> 00:20:04,886
Harvey, how many times
have I told you...

344
00:20:05,053 --> 00:20:07,555
not to leave the estate
without telling me?

345
00:20:07,722 --> 00:20:10,350
- Mom.
- Playtime's over.

346
00:20:10,517 --> 00:20:14,020
- Get in the car, we're going home.
- But, Mom, we're getting married.

347
00:20:14,187 --> 00:20:17,357
To this trash? I don't think so.

348
00:20:18,024 --> 00:20:19,359
Excuse me?

349
00:20:19,901 --> 00:20:21,653
Roll with it, Mom.

350
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:24,406
I'm counting to three, Harvey.

351
00:20:24,572 --> 00:20:26,408
One, twoâ€”

352
00:20:26,574 --> 00:20:29,077
I'm going, I'mâ€”

353
00:20:29,244 --> 00:20:33,498
- Keep the robe.
- Thanks. I'm not wearing pants.

354
00:20:33,665 --> 00:20:36,876
Harvey, do you want me
to put you over my knee?

355
00:20:37,043 --> 00:20:38,586
All right, I'm going.

356
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:44,551
He's really a good boy.

357
00:20:44,718 --> 00:20:48,013
But these things happen
when you marry a first cousin.

358
00:20:52,809 --> 00:20:56,479
I'd say they're lucky to have thumbs.

359
00:21:01,735 --> 00:21:03,403
I'm really sorry to impose on you.

360
00:21:03,570 --> 00:21:06,406
I just feel very uncomfortable
being home alone tonight.

361
00:21:06,573 --> 00:21:09,325
- No problem, you sleep in my room.
- Where will you sleep?

362
00:21:09,492 --> 00:21:11,453
I don't know, I'll find somebody.

363
00:21:14,205 --> 00:21:16,583
- I'm beat. I'm gonna go to bed.
- Good night.

364
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:19,753
- Good night, sweetheart.
- Good night, Mom.

365
00:21:28,428 --> 00:21:32,182
Sleep tight, pudding pop.
