1
00:00:11,807 --> 00:00:14,018
- Good morning.
- Morning.

2
00:00:14,184 --> 00:00:15,352
Charlie, right?

3
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:18,939
Well, I guess it's too late to deny it.

4
00:00:19,106 --> 00:00:20,899
Would you like some coffee?

5
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:23,736
Sure...

6
00:00:25,362 --> 00:00:26,488
I would.

7
00:00:28,616 --> 00:00:30,743
You have a beautiful house.

8
00:00:32,328 --> 00:00:34,580
Thank you...

9
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:39,335
so much.

10
00:00:40,419 --> 00:00:41,545
My name's Sandy.

11
00:00:42,421 --> 00:00:45,007
Yes, of course it is.

12
00:00:46,342 --> 00:00:52,264
How could I forget?
Sandy like the beach, or the Koufax.

13
00:00:53,474 --> 00:00:55,309
- Pardon me?
- You know, Sandy Koufax.

14
00:00:55,476 --> 00:00:58,020
Great Dodger pitcher,
hall-of-famer... Never mind.

15
00:00:59,229 --> 00:01:00,731
So, Sandy...

16
00:01:00,898 --> 00:01:03,233
how did you sleep?

17
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:05,736
Just fine. How about you?

18
00:01:05,903 --> 00:01:08,947
Great. Like a drunk baby.

19
00:01:09,114 --> 00:01:10,616
Are you hungry?

20
00:01:10,783 --> 00:01:13,118
Not yet. Maybe after I throw up.

21
00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:15,079
What did you do last night?

22
00:01:15,245 --> 00:01:17,206
I was hoping you could fill me in.

23
00:01:17,373 --> 00:01:20,959
There's my little Sandy beach.

24
00:01:21,126 --> 00:01:24,046
Good morning, Alley-Oop.

25
00:01:24,463 --> 00:01:28,217
Oh, thank God. I was afraid
I was gonna have to quit drinking.

26
00:01:37,726 --> 00:01:40,020
So, what do you think of Sandy?

27
00:01:40,187 --> 00:01:43,816
Arguably the greatest southpaw
in the history of baseball.

28
00:01:44,733 --> 00:01:45,776
My Sandy.

29
00:01:46,527 --> 00:01:48,695
I don't know,
I've never seen her pitch.

30
00:01:50,656 --> 00:01:54,409
- But she sure can cook.
- Well, guess how we met.

31
00:01:55,035 --> 00:01:57,538
I suppose we can rule out
Dodger Stadium.

32
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:00,791
In cooking class.

33
00:02:01,834 --> 00:02:03,210
You've been taking a class?

34
00:02:03,377 --> 00:02:07,631
- Where do you think I go every Tuesday?
- You're not here on Tuesday nights?

35
00:02:08,674 --> 00:02:12,469
No, I'm in cooking class.
And guess who's the teacher?

36
00:02:12,636 --> 00:02:15,055
- Who?
- Sandy.

37
00:02:17,182 --> 00:02:18,225
Who's Sandy?

38
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:21,436
That's Sandy.

39
00:02:23,689 --> 00:02:24,940
Great story.

40
00:02:26,024 --> 00:02:31,697
- Alan is my star pupil.
- And you are my star teacher.

41
00:02:33,407 --> 00:02:34,533
So cute.

42
00:02:35,117 --> 00:02:36,201
Yo.

43
00:02:38,161 --> 00:02:42,040
- Can I have some more bacon?
- Oh, in a jiff.

44
00:02:42,207 --> 00:02:47,212
My mother always said,
"A well-fed man is a happy man. "

45
00:02:47,379 --> 00:02:51,717
Our mother always said, "Here's
10 bucks for pizza, don't wait up. "

46
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:56,763
Oh, that reminds me, she called
and invited us for Christmas.

47
00:02:56,930 --> 00:02:58,891
- You told her yes, right?
- Absolutely.

48
00:02:59,057 --> 00:03:01,643
You and I were going
to spend Christmas together.

49
00:03:02,102 --> 00:03:03,478
We are.

50
00:03:03,645 --> 00:03:06,607
- But you're going to your mother's.
- What gave you that idea?

51
00:03:08,025 --> 00:03:10,319
You see, Sandy,
it's kind of a family tradition.

52
00:03:10,485 --> 00:03:13,655
Our mother invites us even though
she doesn't want us to come.

53
00:03:13,822 --> 00:03:16,408
We say yes
even though we don't wanna go.

54
00:03:16,575 --> 00:03:18,660
When we don't show,
though she's relieved...

55
00:03:18,827 --> 00:03:22,247
she gets to complain
about what horrible children she has.

56
00:03:22,789 --> 00:03:24,833
It's the perfect gift.

57
00:03:25,876 --> 00:03:29,296
Christmas is supposed to be about
spending time with your loved ones.

58
00:03:29,463 --> 00:03:31,923
Yeah, going to our mother's
would cut into that.

59
00:03:33,467 --> 00:03:37,471
Alan gets to spend it with his son and l
get to play Stuff the Stocking in Vegas...

60
00:03:37,638 --> 00:03:40,724
with a couple
of saline-enhanced elves.

61
00:03:41,308 --> 00:03:44,353
Does this mean
that I'm finally going to meet your son?

62
00:03:44,770 --> 00:03:46,605
I guess it does.

63
00:03:46,772 --> 00:03:49,316
Gosh, I so hope he likes me.

64
00:03:49,483 --> 00:03:51,109
The way you cook...

65
00:03:51,276 --> 00:03:54,780
the only problem is gonna be
keeping him from humping your leg.

66
00:03:55,989 --> 00:03:58,283
That's the sheets.

67
00:03:58,450 --> 00:04:02,120
If you fold them while they're warm,
they don't wrinkle.

68
00:04:05,957 --> 00:04:08,126
Beauty, sex, cooking, laundry.

69
00:04:08,293 --> 00:04:10,837
Marriage, boredom, alimony, death.

70
00:04:11,004 --> 00:04:12,673
You are such a cynic.

71
00:04:12,839 --> 00:04:15,842
- And you are such a sap.
- How am I a sap?

72
00:04:16,009 --> 00:04:19,012
- Are you blind? She's a nester.
- What's that supposed to mean?

73
00:04:19,179 --> 00:04:21,848
She throws you some tail,
a couple of pieces of bacon...

74
00:04:22,015 --> 00:04:24,142
and bibbidi-bobbidi-boo,
got a roommate.

75
00:04:25,769 --> 00:04:28,146
"Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo"?
Isn't that from Cinderella?

76
00:04:28,313 --> 00:04:30,440
You don't think
that bitch was a nester?

77
00:04:32,109 --> 00:04:36,238
Anyway, I find that a couple of drops
of lemon juice on the dryer sheet...

78
00:04:36,405 --> 00:04:38,448
really freshens up the whole load.

79
00:04:38,615 --> 00:04:41,660
Really? I find that just a couple valiums
in my coffee...

80
00:04:41,827 --> 00:04:44,037
keeps me from snapping necks.

81
00:04:49,126 --> 00:04:51,670
Well, hold this, please...

82
00:04:51,837 --> 00:04:56,675
I'm just going to pop these on the bed
while they're still warm and toasty.

83
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:03,056
So which one of you guys is slipping
the high hard one to Martha Stewart?

84
00:05:09,354 --> 00:05:12,107
Hey, Brandi. It's Charlie Harper.

85
00:05:12,274 --> 00:05:14,151
I'm coming to Vegas for Christmas...

86
00:05:14,317 --> 00:05:18,405
and was wondering if you and your
sister wanted to celebrate again.

87
00:05:18,572 --> 00:05:20,907
Harper.

88
00:05:22,701 --> 00:05:27,747
Oh, wait, it's possible that you
remember me as Dr. Philip Gonzalez.

89
00:05:28,707 --> 00:05:30,542
Right.

90
00:05:30,709 --> 00:05:33,712
Yeah, hola.

91
00:05:36,339 --> 00:05:39,426
Anyway, I'm sitting here making
vacation plans and I'm thinking:

92
00:05:39,593 --> 00:05:43,889
"Where better to commemorate the birth
of our lord than Caesar's Palace? "

93
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:47,601
Hey, Charlie. Hungry?

94
00:05:47,767 --> 00:05:48,935
Hold on, Brandi.

95
00:05:49,102 --> 00:05:51,104
- Not really, but listen—
- Last chance.

96
00:05:51,271 --> 00:05:54,232
I'm gonna start dinner
so the kitchen's gonna be off limits.

97
00:05:54,399 --> 00:05:57,027
- But it's my kitchen.
- So?

98
00:05:57,527 --> 00:06:00,196
I just thought it was important
to point out.

99
00:06:00,697 --> 00:06:02,490
You're so cute.

100
00:06:04,659 --> 00:06:08,663
Look, Brandi, talk to your sister, work up
an estimate and I'll call you back.

101
00:06:11,124 --> 00:06:15,795
Oh, hi, Berta.
Oh, I've got a surprise for you.

102
00:06:15,962 --> 00:06:18,882
- A mini-blind brush.
- A what?

103
00:06:19,424 --> 00:06:21,676
I don't think Alan's blinds
have been dusted.

104
00:06:21,843 --> 00:06:24,429
Probably because
you didn't have the proper tool.

105
00:06:24,596 --> 00:06:27,098
Gee, thanks.

106
00:06:31,269 --> 00:06:32,729
- We gotta talk.
- I'm on it.

107
00:06:32,896 --> 00:06:35,231
You better be,
or else she's gonna be on it.

108
00:06:35,398 --> 00:06:38,026
Because now I have the proper tool.

109
00:06:41,863 --> 00:06:44,032
- Hey, listen.
- You had your chance, Charlie.

110
00:06:44,199 --> 00:06:48,203
- lf you're hungry, take a pudding cup.
- I don't want a pudding cup.

111
00:06:48,370 --> 00:06:52,624
- We need to establish ground rules.
- Oh, okay, I'm listening.

112
00:06:52,791 --> 00:06:55,919
Okay, well, first of all,
Berta's been with me for a long time.

113
00:06:56,086 --> 00:06:58,797
And what she lacks
in housekeeping skills...

114
00:06:58,963 --> 00:07:02,509
she more than makes up for
in upper-body strength.

115
00:07:04,511 --> 00:07:05,553
What's that?

116
00:07:06,888 --> 00:07:09,057
- Rack of lamb.
- Really?

117
00:07:09,224 --> 00:07:11,142
- You're making that for us?
- Yep.

118
00:07:11,309 --> 00:07:14,646
With roasted baby potatoes
and caramelized carrots.

119
00:07:18,983 --> 00:07:21,486
Anyway, anyway.

120
00:07:21,653 --> 00:07:22,904
Ground rules.

121
00:07:23,071 --> 00:07:25,031
I wanna be supportive
of you and Alan—

122
00:07:25,198 --> 00:07:28,159
Sorry. One quick question.
Chocolate or raspberry soufflé?

123
00:07:28,326 --> 00:07:31,871
- lt doesn't matter, the point is—
- I'll just make raspberry.

124
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,917
Actually, I prefer chocolate.

125
00:07:36,084 --> 00:07:38,461
Chocolate it is.

126
00:07:38,628 --> 00:07:40,922
Now, why don't I mix you up
a little cocktail...

127
00:07:41,089 --> 00:07:45,051
- ... and you can take a nap before dinner?
- A nap would be nice.

128
00:07:47,303 --> 00:07:48,930
Can I still have the pudding cup?

129
00:07:50,765 --> 00:07:53,476
Okay, but just one.

130
00:07:53,643 --> 00:07:56,271
I don't want you spoiling your appetite
before dinner.

131
00:07:58,106 --> 00:07:59,607
Thank you.

132
00:08:00,984 --> 00:08:02,527
Go on.

133
00:08:03,903 --> 00:08:05,447
- Well?
- Good news.

134
00:08:05,613 --> 00:08:07,198
We're having rack of lamb.

135
00:08:19,377 --> 00:08:20,628
Oh, no.

136
00:08:26,426 --> 00:08:29,053
I'm hungry. Where's Sandy?

137
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:32,265
She went to get a honey-baked ham
for Christmas Eve dinner.

138
00:08:32,432 --> 00:08:34,893
Honey-baked ham.

139
00:08:35,602 --> 00:08:39,981
I find it a little ironic that despite your
warnings about her nesting instincts...

140
00:08:40,148 --> 00:08:42,483
you haven't missed a single one
of her meals.

141
00:08:42,650 --> 00:08:45,320
Yeah, I'm a master of irony.

142
00:08:45,486 --> 00:08:49,115
- I thought you were going to Vegas.
- Oh, you'd like that, wouldn't you?

143
00:08:49,657 --> 00:08:52,076
Then you'd have the whole ham
to yourself.

144
00:08:53,703 --> 00:08:55,663
You should talk, Porky.

145
00:08:55,830 --> 00:08:57,624
Who took the lasagna
under the deck...

146
00:08:57,790 --> 00:09:00,043
so we wouldn't see him eat it
all himself?

147
00:09:00,210 --> 00:09:03,213
Who made a meatloaf sandwich
by taking a slice of meatloaf...

148
00:09:03,379 --> 00:09:06,216
and putting it between
two other slices of meatloaf?

149
00:09:08,426 --> 00:09:11,471
I am cutting down on carbs.

150
00:09:12,055 --> 00:09:13,890
Yeah, it's working for you.

151
00:09:15,475 --> 00:09:19,687
When's the last time you looked down
in the shower and saw your testicles?

152
00:09:19,854 --> 00:09:23,733
I don't need to see them.
I know they're there.

153
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:27,111
And what about you?
What do you call this?

154
00:09:27,278 --> 00:09:28,863
Goodyear or Pirelli?

155
00:09:29,530 --> 00:09:32,367
This, my chunky friend,
is water weight.

156
00:09:32,533 --> 00:09:34,160
Water weight.

157
00:09:34,327 --> 00:09:36,079
It's genetic. I retain water.

158
00:09:36,746 --> 00:09:41,292
You also retain German chocolate cake,
lamb stew and Belgian waffles.

159
00:09:44,253 --> 00:09:49,676
Hey, people who live in fat asses
shouldn't throw waffles.

160
00:09:49,842 --> 00:09:51,719
Don't talk about my ass.

161
00:09:51,886 --> 00:09:54,013
I am very self-conscious about my ass.

162
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:55,932
I'm— I'm sorry.

163
00:09:56,099 --> 00:10:01,521
I'm just lashing out
because I haven't eaten in 75 minutes.

164
00:10:01,688 --> 00:10:03,439
Want some of Sandy's
homemade fudge?

165
00:10:04,774 --> 00:10:06,150
Don't play with me, Alan.

166
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:10,780
- You've got fudge up here?
- Close your eyes.

167
00:10:20,289 --> 00:10:21,332
Okay.

168
00:10:22,625 --> 00:10:23,876
Fudge.

169
00:10:26,587 --> 00:10:28,089
You know what would be great?

170
00:10:28,256 --> 00:10:30,842
Honey-baked fudge.

171
00:10:31,801 --> 00:10:33,469
Or...

172
00:10:33,636 --> 00:10:35,179
fudge-covered ham.

173
00:10:41,352 --> 00:10:44,147
Well, I'm really happy we get
to spend Christmas together.

174
00:10:44,313 --> 00:10:46,482
We don't have to go
to your mom's, do we?

175
00:10:46,649 --> 00:10:48,818
Don't be silly.

176
00:10:49,527 --> 00:10:51,237
Hey, you hungry?

177
00:10:51,404 --> 00:10:55,324
- I could eat.
- Well, you're gonna.

178
00:10:55,491 --> 00:10:57,660
Can we order Chinese
like we did last year?

179
00:10:57,827 --> 00:11:00,997
No, this year we're gonna
do something a little more traditional.

180
00:11:01,164 --> 00:11:03,249
Deli?

181
00:11:03,416 --> 00:11:07,170
No, we're gonna have a real,
home-cooked Christmas dinner.

182
00:11:07,336 --> 00:11:09,547
Whose home?

183
00:11:09,714 --> 00:11:12,842
- Our home.
- How?

184
00:11:13,426 --> 00:11:18,139
Well, I am dating a lady who's
gonna make us a wonderful dinner.

185
00:11:18,598 --> 00:11:19,807
Oh, okay.

186
00:11:21,017 --> 00:11:22,852
Are you at all curious?

187
00:11:23,019 --> 00:11:24,645
Yeah, a little.

188
00:11:24,812 --> 00:11:28,316
Okay, you can ask me any question
and I'll try and answer it for you.

189
00:11:28,983 --> 00:11:30,693
What are we having?

190
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:32,612
No, about the lady.

191
00:11:33,696 --> 00:11:35,364
No, not really.

192
00:11:35,531 --> 00:11:38,326
Well, I just want you to know
that I really like her...

193
00:11:38,493 --> 00:11:41,329
and you're probably gonna
be seeing her a lot.

194
00:11:41,496 --> 00:11:43,206
Do I have to like her?

195
00:11:43,372 --> 00:11:47,460
- Well, of course not.
- Then I probably won't.

196
00:11:48,044 --> 00:11:49,504
Why would you say that?

197
00:11:50,004 --> 00:11:53,007
We're very different people, Dad.

198
00:11:54,383 --> 00:11:56,177
So true.

199
00:11:56,344 --> 00:11:59,138
Is she gonna be staying over?

200
00:11:59,889 --> 00:12:02,808
- Yes.
- Where is she gonna sleep?

201
00:12:02,975 --> 00:12:04,143
In my room.

202
00:12:04,936 --> 00:12:06,479
Okay.

203
00:12:06,646 --> 00:12:10,441
Just remember, the walls are thin
and I'm impressionable.

204
00:12:19,575 --> 00:12:21,327
Hey, what are you doing out here?

205
00:12:22,161 --> 00:12:23,746
I thought I should prepare you.

206
00:12:24,205 --> 00:12:25,248
For what?

207
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:27,917
Alan.

208
00:12:29,168 --> 00:12:31,003
Remember what I told you
about nesters?

209
00:12:31,170 --> 00:12:32,463
Yeah.

210
00:12:32,630 --> 00:12:36,467
Well, some are hummingbirds,
some are robins.

211
00:12:36,634 --> 00:12:39,303
But you, my friend...

212
00:12:48,270 --> 00:12:52,274
you've got yourself a partridge
in a freaking pear tree.

213
00:12:56,946 --> 00:12:59,824
- Sandy did all this?
- Yep.

214
00:12:59,991 --> 00:13:02,785
I think it's cool.
It's like an amusement park.

215
00:13:02,952 --> 00:13:06,706
Yeah, Six Flags
Over Crazy-Ass-Chick Land.

216
00:13:07,498 --> 00:13:09,750
This cannot be Jake.

217
00:13:09,917 --> 00:13:11,627
You're too grown-up-looking.

218
00:13:11,794 --> 00:13:13,838
Yeah, thanks.
Are those for anybody?

219
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:15,423
Help yourselves.

220
00:13:20,094 --> 00:13:21,762
Gingerbread.

221
00:13:21,929 --> 00:13:24,015
Jake, you can help me
in the kitchen.

222
00:13:24,181 --> 00:13:27,309
I'm making chocolate éclairs
and I need an official taster.

223
00:13:27,476 --> 00:13:28,602
I like her.

224
00:13:33,190 --> 00:13:35,735
Will you look at that?
They're bonding already.

225
00:13:35,901 --> 00:13:39,613
Alan, your kid would join the T aliban
if they made their own s'mores.

226
00:13:41,741 --> 00:13:44,785
- So when did she do all this decorating?
- Hard to say.

227
00:13:44,952 --> 00:13:49,290
- Everything was normal until lunchtime.
- Oh, I missed lunch.

228
00:13:49,457 --> 00:13:50,499
What did you have?

229
00:13:51,751 --> 00:13:54,879
She made me a bacon, lettuce
and tomato sandwich...

230
00:13:55,045 --> 00:13:57,840
with garlic mayonnaise
on sourdough toast.

231
00:13:58,007 --> 00:14:01,010
Oh, damn.

232
00:14:01,510 --> 00:14:03,804
Anyway, after lunch I took
a little nap...

233
00:14:03,971 --> 00:14:08,184
and woke up
in Santa's Village of the Damned.

234
00:14:08,851 --> 00:14:10,478
Why do you have to be so cynical?

235
00:14:10,644 --> 00:14:16,233
There is nothing wrong with decorating
your home to show a little holiday spirit.

236
00:14:16,609 --> 00:14:18,235
But it's not her home, is it?

237
00:14:18,736 --> 00:14:19,862
Well, no.

238
00:14:20,029 --> 00:14:23,866
- Whose home is it, Alan?
- Okay, fine, I will have a talk with her.

239
00:14:24,033 --> 00:14:25,993
- Hold it.
- What?

240
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:28,287
After dinner, you nimrod.

241
00:14:35,669 --> 00:14:37,880
Anybody have room for another éclair?

242
00:14:38,047 --> 00:14:39,924
Not unless I unbutton my pants.

243
00:14:40,090 --> 00:14:42,343
Mine are already unbuttoned.

244
00:14:42,510 --> 00:14:46,514
I took mine off when she brought out
the marshmallow yams.

245
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:49,600
Okay, then. What do you say
we all go into the living room...

246
00:14:49,767 --> 00:14:51,519
and sing some Christmas carols?

247
00:14:52,311 --> 00:14:55,439
- You mean stand up?
- I don't think I can.

248
00:14:55,606 --> 00:14:58,025
I'm not wearing pants.

249
00:14:58,192 --> 00:15:01,070
Come on, you guys,
what's Christmas without caroling?

250
00:15:01,612 --> 00:15:03,656
Hanukkah?

251
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:20,965
Sandy? Something wrong?

252
00:15:21,131 --> 00:15:22,549
Who moved the reindeer?

253
00:15:23,467 --> 00:15:25,761
I don't know that one, but I'll wing it.

254
00:15:25,928 --> 00:15:30,140
Who moved the reindeer?
The savior's come

255
00:15:30,307 --> 00:15:33,352
He 's coming to check on the rein—

256
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:35,688
No, no, no.

257
00:15:36,855 --> 00:15:39,942
- These reindeer.
- What about them?

258
00:15:40,484 --> 00:15:42,528
Donner and Blitzen are out of order.

259
00:15:42,695 --> 00:15:44,947
- Somebody's been playing with them.
- So?

260
00:15:45,114 --> 00:15:46,907
So I wanna know who it was.

261
00:15:47,449 --> 00:15:50,077
- Jake?
- I didn't do it.

262
00:15:50,244 --> 00:15:51,287
Charlie?

263
00:15:52,913 --> 00:15:56,667
Oh, all right, I may have used one
of them as a swizzle stick.

264
00:15:58,460 --> 00:16:00,587
Well, no harm done.

265
00:16:00,754 --> 00:16:02,923
If you must play with them,
please remember...

266
00:16:03,090 --> 00:16:06,593
it's Dasher, Dancer, Prancer, Vixen,
Comet, Cupid, Donner, Blitzen.

267
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:07,970
Okay.

268
00:16:08,137 --> 00:16:10,556
Donner, Blitzen, Donner, Blitzen,
Donner, Blitzen.

269
00:16:12,016 --> 00:16:13,058
- Got it.
- Say it.

270
00:16:14,184 --> 00:16:15,811
Donner, Blitzen.

271
00:16:18,105 --> 00:16:19,773
Okay, then.

272
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:22,526
"The Little Drummer Boy. "

273
00:16:55,559 --> 00:16:58,270
Donner, Blitzen, Donner, Blitzen.

274
00:16:59,855 --> 00:17:02,399
Alan. Why aren't you asleep?

275
00:17:03,192 --> 00:17:04,485
I don't know.

276
00:17:04,651 --> 00:17:08,155
Just excited about Christmas, I guess.

277
00:17:08,572 --> 00:17:11,408
Well, Santa won't come
while you're awake.

278
00:17:11,575 --> 00:17:14,787
Yeah. Yeah, I've heard that.

279
00:17:15,287 --> 00:17:17,956
Now close your eyes
and let visions of sugarplums...

280
00:17:18,123 --> 00:17:20,918
dance through your wee little head.

281
00:17:21,084 --> 00:17:23,045
Okay.

282
00:17:26,423 --> 00:17:28,801
- Oh, no.
- What?

283
00:17:28,967 --> 00:17:32,846
I forgot to put out cookies
and milk for Santa.

284
00:17:33,639 --> 00:17:35,974
You're kidding, right?

285
00:17:36,141 --> 00:17:37,851
Do you want coal in your stocking?

286
00:17:38,519 --> 00:17:42,397
That's what you're gonna get if Santa
doesn't find a snack when he comes.

287
00:17:42,564 --> 00:17:44,608
I see.

288
00:17:44,775 --> 00:17:49,029
So you believe in the vengeful,
Old Testament Santa.

289
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:51,281
Are you mocking Christmas?

290
00:17:51,448 --> 00:17:53,325
No, no, no. You know what?

291
00:17:53,825 --> 00:17:57,746
I'll take care of the milk and cookies.
You just relax and go to sleep.

292
00:17:59,748 --> 00:18:03,043
He sees us when we're sleeping,
you know?

293
00:18:04,253 --> 00:18:05,295
Right.

294
00:18:06,338 --> 00:18:08,382
I don't make the rules.

295
00:18:09,550 --> 00:18:11,468
Okay.

296
00:18:15,722 --> 00:18:19,226
Oh, God, oh, God

297
00:18:19,393 --> 00:18:23,188
Oh, God, oh, God

298
00:18:24,064 --> 00:18:26,108
- Charlie?
- Hang on.

299
00:18:31,905 --> 00:18:34,908
Okay, I'm ready for more pie.

300
00:18:35,492 --> 00:18:37,369
We have a serious problem here.

301
00:18:37,536 --> 00:18:39,246
We're out of pie?

302
00:18:39,413 --> 00:18:41,957
Will you listen?
There's something wrong with Sandy.

303
00:18:42,124 --> 00:18:45,252
Well, didn't we know that
when she agreed to sleep with you?

304
00:18:45,419 --> 00:18:49,548
No, no, even wronger than that.
She actually believes in Santa Claus.

305
00:18:49,715 --> 00:18:51,216
- Really?
- Yeah.

306
00:18:52,759 --> 00:18:54,303
But we still have pie?

307
00:18:54,469 --> 00:18:58,807
- Yes, we still have pie.
- Then what are we doing up here?

308
00:19:00,225 --> 00:19:03,061
I guess I could have a little sliver.

309
00:19:19,453 --> 00:19:21,204
You know what?

310
00:19:21,371 --> 00:19:24,249
I think something's wrong with Sandy.

311
00:19:24,958 --> 00:19:28,545
I just said that.
Do you ever listen to me?

312
00:19:29,629 --> 00:19:32,174
Sandy, sweetheart?

313
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:35,927
- You okay?
- He's not coming.

314
00:19:36,094 --> 00:19:38,555
Who's not coming? Listen to this.

315
00:19:39,681 --> 00:19:40,724
Santa.

316
00:19:43,393 --> 00:19:46,354
Every year,
I try to make things perfect.

317
00:19:46,521 --> 00:19:50,150
And every year I fail.

318
00:19:50,317 --> 00:19:52,402
Mama was right.

319
00:19:52,569 --> 00:19:55,322
I am a naughty girl.

320
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:59,284
Come on, Alan.

321
00:19:59,451 --> 00:20:00,786
Where are we going?

322
00:20:02,454 --> 00:20:05,040
I want you to teach this naughty girl
a lesson.

323
00:20:05,207 --> 00:20:07,084
She needs to be punished.

324
00:20:10,212 --> 00:20:12,714
You lucky dog.

325
00:20:13,465 --> 00:20:15,926
What? I'm not going in there.
She's nuts.

326
00:20:16,093 --> 00:20:19,554
Yeah, so?
Sex with crazy chicks is great.

327
00:20:19,721 --> 00:20:23,183
Make sure you pick positions where
you can see what her hands are doing.

328
00:20:23,350 --> 00:20:25,393
No. No, that would be
taking advantage...

329
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:27,604
of a mentally unbalanced person.

330
00:20:27,771 --> 00:20:30,440
Oh, Alan, that boat has sailed.

331
00:20:30,607 --> 00:20:34,069
You might as well hop on board
for a farewell cruise.

332
00:20:34,236 --> 00:20:36,696
I don't think so.
It just wouldn't be right.

333
00:20:36,863 --> 00:20:40,617
Come on, Alan, I'm ready.

334
00:20:47,624 --> 00:20:49,876
Good night.

335
00:20:55,215 --> 00:20:59,427
Okay, pie for everybody.

336
00:21:04,057 --> 00:21:05,725
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

337
00:21:06,476 --> 00:21:08,103
Are you out of your mind?

338
00:21:08,270 --> 00:21:11,314
You've been nagging us for years
to spend Christmas with you.

339
00:21:11,481 --> 00:21:13,692
Only because I knew
you'd never show up.

340
00:21:14,234 --> 00:21:16,194
Well, we had to get out of the house.

341
00:21:16,361 --> 00:21:18,655
Y eah, the walls are thin
and I'm impressionable.

342
00:21:20,115 --> 00:21:25,078
Hold on. Stanley, put your pants on.
We'll exchange gifts later.

343
00:21:26,246 --> 00:21:27,289
Come on in.

344
00:21:29,874 --> 00:21:33,878
Dear God, look at the size of your ass.

345
