1
00:00:03,252 --> 00:00:04,920
Pretty fancy prices here.

2
00:00:05,296 --> 00:00:09,091
Yeah, well, just so we're clear,
I am picking up the tab tonight.

3
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:11,927
- Okay.
- This is my celebration. I invited you.

4
00:00:12,303 --> 00:00:13,554
Fine.

5
00:00:13,762 --> 00:00:16,932
- So don't go grabbing the check.
- I won't touch the check.

6
00:00:19,143 --> 00:00:21,395
If you wanna leave the tip,
that'd be okay.

7
00:00:21,937 --> 00:00:22,980
I could do that.

8
00:00:24,064 --> 00:00:25,774
I usually leave 15 percent...

9
00:00:25,983 --> 00:00:28,611
but if you wanna leave 20,
that's your call.

10
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:30,988
Thank you.

11
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:34,783
Unless you think it's easier
if we just split the check.

12
00:00:35,409 --> 00:00:36,452
Whatever.

13
00:00:36,911 --> 00:00:40,539
Of course, in many families if someone
is celebrating some good news...

14
00:00:40,748 --> 00:00:43,209
his brother would insist
on buying dinner.

15
00:00:44,627 --> 00:00:47,296
- Then why don't I do that.
- But I'll leave the tip.

16
00:00:47,505 --> 00:00:49,173
- One question.
- What?

17
00:00:49,381 --> 00:00:51,383
- Do you have any money?
- No.

18
00:00:54,261 --> 00:00:56,305
I left my wallet at home.

19
00:00:57,056 --> 00:00:59,016
You mean this wallet?

20
00:01:05,689 --> 00:01:07,358
Oh, good, you found it.

21
00:01:08,943 --> 00:01:11,153
I was looking all over.

22
00:01:12,488 --> 00:01:15,532
So where did we leave things?
You're paying, we're splitting?

23
00:01:15,741 --> 00:01:16,992
Oh, just shut up.

24
00:01:18,494 --> 00:01:20,663
What's this good news
you're celebrating?

25
00:01:20,871 --> 00:01:23,666
It's a surprise.
I wanna wait till Mom gets here.

26
00:01:23,874 --> 00:01:27,544
Yes, Jake, we see the spoon
on your nose, now stop it.

27
00:01:27,753 --> 00:01:28,796
Can you do it?

28
00:01:29,004 --> 00:01:32,341
I don't want to do it.
Now, behave yourself.

29
00:01:34,426 --> 00:01:35,469
Oh, work with me.

30
00:01:38,097 --> 00:01:39,181
Just wonderful.

31
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:41,684
You pick a restaurant
that has no valet.

32
00:01:41,892 --> 00:01:43,727
I had to park three blocks away...

33
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:46,730
and then schlep here in shoes
that are not for walking.

34
00:01:46,939 --> 00:01:49,316
I've got a blister the size
of a Communion wafer.

35
00:01:49,525 --> 00:01:52,277
And if Mommy doesn't get
something to drink immediately...

36
00:01:52,486 --> 00:01:54,905
things are going to get very ugly.

37
00:01:55,739 --> 00:01:57,491
Let the celebration begin.

38
00:01:58,867 --> 00:02:03,372
Maybe the lesson here, Mom, is to buy
shoes that are made for walking.

39
00:02:04,206 --> 00:02:05,874
Is it just me?

40
00:02:06,083 --> 00:02:07,960
In a perfect world, it would be.

41
00:02:09,628 --> 00:02:13,048
Well, anyway I'm here. So, what's
your big announcement, Alan?

42
00:02:13,257 --> 00:02:14,967
Jake, get that spoon off your nose.

43
00:02:15,175 --> 00:02:18,303
- You don't know where it's been.
- It's been on my nose.

44
00:02:20,014 --> 00:02:23,642
You really must start looking
at trade schools for the boy.

45
00:02:23,851 --> 00:02:27,563
Now that we are all here,
I have some good news to share.

46
00:02:28,605 --> 00:02:31,567
This is not gonna be on the
newsstands for a couple of days...

47
00:02:31,775 --> 00:02:34,403
but I have an advance copy.

48
00:02:38,323 --> 00:02:40,534
"Good doctor, good neighbor,
good guy. "

49
00:02:40,743 --> 00:02:42,077
Good God.

50
00:02:42,911 --> 00:02:45,456
- Hey, Dad, you're famous.
- Well, not really.

51
00:02:45,664 --> 00:02:49,042
Well, among the readers of the
Tarzana Pennysaver, maybe a little.

52
00:02:49,251 --> 00:02:52,588
Don't forget the homeless people
who make underpants out of it.

53
00:02:53,213 --> 00:02:55,215
Charlie, don't be disrespectful.

54
00:02:55,424 --> 00:02:56,884
Thank you, Mom.

55
00:02:57,092 --> 00:03:01,221
So how much advertising did you have
to buy in exchange for this puff piece?

56
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:03,724
Why do you assume
that I had to buy advertising?

57
00:03:03,932 --> 00:03:07,644
Is it that hard to believe that a local
newspaper might run a cover story...

58
00:03:07,853 --> 00:03:10,689
about a successful
local chiropractor?

59
00:03:10,898 --> 00:03:12,316
Well, frankly, yes.

60
00:03:13,734 --> 00:03:17,029
Unless the chiropractor shot four
people to death in a mini-mart...

61
00:03:17,237 --> 00:03:19,615
and then turned
the weapon on himself.

62
00:03:19,823 --> 00:03:23,368
You know, I get why Charlie has never
acknowledged my accomplishments.

63
00:03:23,577 --> 00:03:25,954
He's a hedonist
who can't get behind anyone...

64
00:03:26,163 --> 00:03:29,291
unless they're drunk
and bent over a pool table.

65
00:03:29,791 --> 00:03:31,084
That's fair.

66
00:03:31,293 --> 00:03:32,794
But my own mother—

67
00:03:33,003 --> 00:03:35,255
You're up.

68
00:03:36,173 --> 00:03:37,841
Refusing to even feign interest.

69
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:40,010
I did so feign interest.

70
00:03:40,219 --> 00:03:43,013
You assumed I had to buy advertising
to get the article.

71
00:03:43,222 --> 00:03:44,890
Well, did you?

72
00:03:45,098 --> 00:03:47,976
Neighborhood advertising
is a good investment.

73
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:51,939
- But that is not the point.
- All right, what is the point?

74
00:03:52,147 --> 00:03:55,484
The point is, I can't even get
a simple attaboy from own my mother.

75
00:03:56,151 --> 00:03:59,488
Oh, well, I'm sorry.

76
00:04:01,823 --> 00:04:03,450
Attaboy.

77
00:04:05,369 --> 00:04:06,662
Feel better?

78
00:04:07,246 --> 00:04:10,624
- No, I do not feel better.
- Did I not say it right?

79
00:04:10,832 --> 00:04:14,962
You know what? Forget it.
Let's just order, eat and get out of here.

80
00:04:15,754 --> 00:04:18,006
One more of these,
and please keep them coming.

81
00:04:18,215 --> 00:04:21,051
I'll buy the drinks.
Unless you wanna split it with me.

82
00:04:30,477 --> 00:04:34,022
And you know what else?
You know what else?

83
00:04:34,231 --> 00:04:35,983
No, Alan, what else?

84
00:04:36,191 --> 00:04:41,530
I cannot believe that our mother
made us carry her to her car...

85
00:04:41,738 --> 00:04:44,866
just because she had a teeny-weeny
little blister on her foot.

86
00:04:46,285 --> 00:04:51,290
Well, hopefully the next time we have
to carry her she'll be in a handy urn.

87
00:04:53,709 --> 00:04:56,003
I'll pay for the urn
if you get the cremation.

88
00:04:56,211 --> 00:04:57,754
Done.

89
00:04:59,506 --> 00:05:02,134
- Jake? Where's my son?
- Right here, Dad.

90
00:05:02,342 --> 00:05:04,636
Oh, oh, good, good.

91
00:05:04,845 --> 00:05:06,888
Now, listen, boy.

92
00:05:07,973 --> 00:05:11,601
Your old dad
is not going to be here for—

93
00:05:17,816 --> 00:05:20,068
Is not going to be here forever.

94
00:05:20,277 --> 00:05:22,487
And when I'm gone...

95
00:05:22,696 --> 00:05:25,824
I want there to be no doubt
in your mind...

96
00:05:26,033 --> 00:05:28,952
that I was as proud as punch...

97
00:05:30,037 --> 00:05:35,167
about all of your accomplishments,
no matter how miniscule.

98
00:05:35,667 --> 00:05:38,045
Boy, you're really plowed, aren't you?

99
00:05:39,254 --> 00:05:42,966
No. Your daddy doesn't get plowed.

100
00:05:43,467 --> 00:05:45,594
He just gets a little:

101
00:05:52,059 --> 00:05:56,563
Anyway, the important thing
for you to know...

102
00:05:56,772 --> 00:05:59,274
is how much I love you.

103
00:05:59,691 --> 00:06:02,235
You told the waiter you loved him too.

104
00:06:03,862 --> 00:06:05,530
He was a very good waiter.

105
00:06:07,532 --> 00:06:12,412
And it's also important for you to know
that you can be anything you want.

106
00:06:12,621 --> 00:06:14,080
Anything in the world.

107
00:06:14,289 --> 00:06:17,626
- No, I can't.
- You're right. That's a crock.

108
00:06:20,378 --> 00:06:23,423
But I love you...

109
00:06:23,757 --> 00:06:26,092
and you have cheeks like a beaver.

110
00:06:27,010 --> 00:06:28,637
Now go to bed.

111
00:06:28,845 --> 00:06:31,848
Dad, we've been learning
about alcohol abuse at school.

112
00:06:32,057 --> 00:06:35,310
And if you ever need a new liver
you can have half of mine.

113
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:37,437
Hey, hey, hey.
I thought we had a deal.

114
00:06:37,646 --> 00:06:39,606
Oh, yeah. Sorry, Dad.

115
00:06:42,567 --> 00:06:44,653
Best 5 bucks I ever spent.

116
00:06:46,363 --> 00:06:49,491
Now come on, let's tuck you into bed.

117
00:06:49,699 --> 00:06:55,497
Why can't my mother appreciate me?
All I wanted was one sincere attaboy.

118
00:06:55,705 --> 00:06:57,290
Was that too much to ask?

119
00:07:01,127 --> 00:07:03,088
Attaboy.

120
00:07:06,925 --> 00:07:10,345
Well, that looks like the last
of the scallops.

121
00:07:11,221 --> 00:07:13,807
Now all we gotta do
is wait for dessert.

122
00:07:15,016 --> 00:07:16,893
Rainbow sherbet.

123
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:19,396
Oh, that should be pretty.

124
00:07:20,438 --> 00:07:24,484
You know, I have spent
my entire life...

125
00:07:24,693 --> 00:07:27,946
trying to please Mom
to make her proud of me.

126
00:07:28,154 --> 00:07:29,531
But no more.

127
00:07:29,739 --> 00:07:31,408
I am done trying.

128
00:07:31,616 --> 00:07:32,784
Good for you.

129
00:07:33,285 --> 00:07:35,579
Oh, excuse me.

130
00:07:41,459 --> 00:07:42,961
Nope.

131
00:07:44,587 --> 00:07:48,717
You know, if you put the seat down,
it's easier to rest your arms.

132
00:07:50,802 --> 00:07:52,929
Oh, you're right.

133
00:07:54,055 --> 00:07:56,182
You're a wise man, Charlie Harper.

134
00:07:56,683 --> 00:08:00,103
Well, I do have a few pockets
of specialized knowledge.

135
00:08:00,312 --> 00:08:02,897
Some might call it wisdom.

136
00:08:05,066 --> 00:08:06,776
And it seems warmer too.

137
00:08:07,193 --> 00:08:10,405
It's further away from the cooling effect
of the water.

138
00:08:10,613 --> 00:08:15,410
Not to mention the residual body heat
accrued from thousands of ass hours.

139
00:08:19,831 --> 00:08:22,625
You've really given a lot of thought
to this.

140
00:08:23,376 --> 00:08:25,337
I'm thinking of writing a book.

141
00:08:25,712 --> 00:08:27,672
And I will read it.

142
00:08:28,089 --> 00:08:29,132
Thank you.

143
00:08:30,884 --> 00:08:32,427
You know what I am, Charlie?

144
00:08:32,886 --> 00:08:34,721
Yes.

145
00:08:34,929 --> 00:08:37,057
I am a pathological people pleaser.

146
00:08:37,849 --> 00:08:40,393
I had an entirely different answer.

147
00:08:40,935 --> 00:08:44,981
But more accurately,
I am a woman pleaser.

148
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:48,526
No, Alan, I am a woman pleaser.

149
00:08:48,735 --> 00:08:52,363
You're a lonely guy
speckled with vomit.

150
00:08:52,822 --> 00:08:58,912
No, I'm not speaking physically,
I'm speaking psychologically.

151
00:08:59,788 --> 00:09:01,414
With Mom.

152
00:09:01,623 --> 00:09:03,792
With Judith.

153
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,877
With every woman I've ever met.

154
00:09:06,086 --> 00:09:10,590
I have twisted myself into knots
just trying to get them to like me.

155
00:09:10,799 --> 00:09:12,759
My education...

156
00:09:12,967 --> 00:09:17,055
my job, my clothes, my car...

157
00:09:17,263 --> 00:09:19,224
my very behavior.

158
00:09:19,432 --> 00:09:24,354
All chosen simply to get women
to approve of me.

159
00:09:25,021 --> 00:09:27,398
And how's that worked out for you?

160
00:09:28,149 --> 00:09:29,943
They don't approve of me.

161
00:09:32,445 --> 00:09:34,781
But I am going to change, Charlie.

162
00:09:35,573 --> 00:09:39,327
I am no longer going to grovel
for Mom's approval...

163
00:09:39,536 --> 00:09:42,539
or for the approval of any woman.

164
00:09:42,997 --> 00:09:47,335
I am going to live the remainder
of my life...

165
00:09:47,544 --> 00:09:49,003
with pride...

166
00:09:49,212 --> 00:09:54,843
and a quiet, noble dignity.

167
00:09:59,013 --> 00:10:02,809
But first, I'll sleep with my head
in the crapper.

168
00:10:28,876 --> 00:10:30,837
Can I make you some oatmeal?

169
00:10:31,379 --> 00:10:32,589
I've got cereal.

170
00:10:32,797 --> 00:10:34,173
I know.

171
00:10:34,382 --> 00:10:37,427
I just thought you might enjoy
something hot...

172
00:10:37,635 --> 00:10:39,929
and quiet.

173
00:10:40,388 --> 00:10:41,514
Nope.

174
00:10:44,350 --> 00:10:45,810
Do you have a hangover?

175
00:10:46,269 --> 00:10:47,520
Yeah.

176
00:10:47,729 --> 00:10:50,523
Drinking that much
was a stupid thing to do.

177
00:10:50,898 --> 00:10:52,609
So then why'd you do it?

178
00:10:53,526 --> 00:10:54,611
I don't know, Jake.

179
00:10:54,819 --> 00:10:59,949
- Maybe I'm just stupid.
- Or maybe you just don't apply yourself.

180
00:11:03,286 --> 00:11:06,039
Can we stop talking for a while?

181
00:11:06,247 --> 00:11:07,999
Okay.

182
00:11:11,169 --> 00:11:14,589
Although I do like a little conversation
at breakfast.

183
00:11:16,090 --> 00:11:17,175
Morning, everybody.

184
00:11:17,592 --> 00:11:18,634
He's hung-over.

185
00:11:19,177 --> 00:11:20,511
Oh, yeah.

186
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:23,348
Well, isn't this an ironic turn
of events?

187
00:11:23,556 --> 00:11:25,683
Me, waking up feeling
all bright and chipper.

188
00:11:25,892 --> 00:11:27,894
And you looking like a stool sample.

189
00:11:30,772 --> 00:11:32,565
Not a big irony fan, huh?

190
00:11:33,024 --> 00:11:34,484
- Charlie?
- Yeah.

191
00:11:34,692 --> 00:11:38,905
Either stop talking or at least
have the decency to kill me.

192
00:11:39,947 --> 00:11:43,076
- Boy, I'm never gonna drink.
- Good job.

193
00:11:43,284 --> 00:11:44,660
You scarred the kid for life.

194
00:11:44,869 --> 00:11:47,580
Now he's gonna have to face
junior high sober.

195
00:11:48,498 --> 00:11:51,209
- Just tell me one thing.
- What's that?

196
00:11:51,417 --> 00:11:54,378
Did I really tell the waiter
I loved him last night?

197
00:11:55,421 --> 00:11:58,382
You had to say something
after a kiss like that.

198
00:11:58,883 --> 00:12:01,052
Oh, God.

199
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:03,429
- I took care of your bathroom.
- Thank you.

200
00:12:03,638 --> 00:12:06,974
I hope you like the smell
of pine-scented puke.

201
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:11,395
So did I do anything else
I'm gonna regret?

202
00:12:11,604 --> 00:12:14,732
- Well, you paid for dinner.
- Jeez.

203
00:12:17,401 --> 00:12:20,154
And after we got home there was some
drunken blubbering...

204
00:12:20,363 --> 00:12:22,907
about how you weren't
going to grovel for women.

205
00:12:23,116 --> 00:12:26,077
Oh, right. I almost forgot.

206
00:12:26,285 --> 00:12:29,247
I had a life-changing epiphany
last night.

207
00:12:29,455 --> 00:12:32,708
Before or after you yakked up
a hunk of your esophagus?

208
00:12:33,209 --> 00:12:34,877
No, no, it's no joke.

209
00:12:35,086 --> 00:12:37,171
I've reached a turning point.

210
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:40,341
From this day on, my actions
will no longer be predicated...

211
00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:43,553
on pleasing the castrating
mother figures in my life.

212
00:12:46,347 --> 00:12:49,141
- What's so funny?
- Nothing.

213
00:12:52,353 --> 00:12:54,146
I think she doubts your epiphany.

214
00:12:55,147 --> 00:12:56,399
She'll see.

215
00:12:56,607 --> 00:12:57,775
They'll all see.

216
00:12:57,984 --> 00:13:01,696
Starting now, I am a new Alan.

217
00:13:03,364 --> 00:13:06,033
Oh, damn, I think I wet myself.

218
00:13:06,367 --> 00:13:10,454
Starting now, I will fear
no woman's disapproval.

219
00:13:10,663 --> 00:13:14,709
Oh, God, that's Judith. I was supposed
to have Jake ready. She's gonna kill me.

220
00:13:16,419 --> 00:13:18,713
Okay, starting now.

221
00:13:19,255 --> 00:13:20,464
Good for you.

222
00:13:20,882 --> 00:13:22,967
- Oh, I better get that.
- Let her wait.

223
00:13:23,175 --> 00:13:27,763
What she thinks of you doesn't matter.
What counts is what you think of you.

224
00:13:27,972 --> 00:13:29,098
You're right.

225
00:13:29,307 --> 00:13:31,392
It's what I think of me.

226
00:13:34,854 --> 00:13:38,524
- Alan?
- I had so much potential.

227
00:13:38,733 --> 00:13:40,943
Okay, forget what you think of you.

228
00:13:41,152 --> 00:13:43,696
Yeah, I'm probably too close to me
to see me clearly.

229
00:13:43,904 --> 00:13:45,531
Yeah, that's it.

230
00:13:46,616 --> 00:13:47,950
Oh, do I smell like vomit?

231
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:51,245
Don't worry, I'll stand next to you.
She'll assume it's me.

232
00:13:51,454 --> 00:13:53,873
Good, good.

233
00:13:55,958 --> 00:13:57,293
Hi, Alan. Jake ready?

234
00:13:58,669 --> 00:14:01,339
- No, he is not.
- You said you'd have him ready.

235
00:14:04,467 --> 00:14:05,509
Well, I don't.

236
00:14:05,718 --> 00:14:11,849
And if that makes you unhappy with me,
well, I don't give a rat's furry ass.

237
00:14:12,808 --> 00:14:16,020
- What did you just say to me?
- Nothing, I'm sorry. Jake.

238
00:14:16,228 --> 00:14:18,689
- Starting now?
- Starting soon.

239
00:14:22,318 --> 00:14:24,153
You know what that smell is?

240
00:14:24,362 --> 00:14:27,406
Epiphany for men.

241
00:14:30,826 --> 00:14:32,995
So how long you been
in Los Angeles?

242
00:14:33,204 --> 00:14:35,998
About eight months.
Haven't got a single audition yet.

243
00:14:36,207 --> 00:14:39,460
Yeah, this can be a tough town
when you don't know anybody.

244
00:14:44,924 --> 00:14:47,343
So do you have
like a headshot or a résumé?

245
00:14:51,138 --> 00:14:52,890
- ls he okay?
- I don't know.

246
00:14:53,265 --> 00:14:55,351
Sir, are you okay?

247
00:14:56,227 --> 00:14:59,647
- I thought we came here to talk.
- Not to each other.

248
00:15:06,654 --> 00:15:09,323
- Let's talk. What's bothering you?
- I changed my mind...

249
00:15:09,532 --> 00:15:11,909
- ... I don't wanna talk about it.
- Talk or die.

250
00:15:13,661 --> 00:15:15,746
All right. I'm depressed.

251
00:15:15,955 --> 00:15:18,582
I wanna change but I can't.
Whenever I'm confronted...

252
00:15:18,791 --> 00:15:21,502
by a disapproving woman,
something inside me crumbles.

253
00:15:21,710 --> 00:15:23,921
Well, Alan,
maybe that's just who you are.

254
00:15:24,130 --> 00:15:28,425
You know, fish gotta swim,
birds gotta fly, you gotta crumble.

255
00:15:29,426 --> 00:15:32,596
What I don't understand
is I can intellectually see the problem...

256
00:15:32,805 --> 00:15:34,807
but I just can't do anything about it.

257
00:15:35,015 --> 00:15:37,726
Excuse me. Can I have more
of these little pretzels?

258
00:15:37,935 --> 00:15:40,896
- ln a minute.
- Okay, sorry. No hurry.

259
00:15:41,897 --> 00:15:43,691
Look, it's very simple.

260
00:15:43,899 --> 00:15:46,110
You were conditioned
to seek Mom's approval.

261
00:15:46,318 --> 00:15:48,154
You're still seeking Mom's approval...

262
00:15:48,362 --> 00:15:50,614
and you make every woman
a substitute mom.

263
00:15:50,823 --> 00:15:52,950
But what about you?
We had the same mother.

264
00:15:53,492 --> 00:15:55,786
I handle my conditioning
in a different way.

265
00:15:55,995 --> 00:15:59,039
I have casual and often degrading sex
with my substitute moms...

266
00:15:59,248 --> 00:16:02,877
but we're talking about you
and not me so forget I said that.

267
00:16:06,589 --> 00:16:09,008
Oh, how I'll try.

268
00:16:09,216 --> 00:16:12,177
But how do you deal with the fear
of disapproval?

269
00:16:12,386 --> 00:16:14,471
I mean, you must get
shot down occasionally.

270
00:16:14,930 --> 00:16:16,515
Occasionally? Constantly.

271
00:16:16,724 --> 00:16:18,392
Constantly?

272
00:16:18,601 --> 00:16:20,603
Occasionally.

273
00:16:21,437 --> 00:16:23,272
It's a numbers game, Alan.

274
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:26,066
We all want the shiny apple
on top of the tree.

275
00:16:26,275 --> 00:16:29,904
But sometimes you gotta settle
for one on a lower branch.

276
00:16:30,112 --> 00:16:33,449
Of course, there's times you pick up
whatever's lying on the ground...

277
00:16:33,657 --> 00:16:35,534
and put it in your mouth.

278
00:16:36,243 --> 00:16:39,955
But how do you manage to keep going
on in the face of constant rejection?

279
00:16:40,497 --> 00:16:41,957
Occasional rejection.

280
00:16:43,334 --> 00:16:45,794
Okay, lesson one:

281
00:16:46,003 --> 00:16:47,463
Look around.

282
00:16:47,671 --> 00:16:51,592
Out of all the women here, which one
do you find the most attractive?

283
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:53,385
Let's see.

284
00:17:10,819 --> 00:17:12,029
Her.

285
00:17:12,237 --> 00:17:13,322
The brunette? Why?

286
00:17:13,822 --> 00:17:16,033
I don't know,
there's just something about her.

287
00:17:16,742 --> 00:17:21,163
- Yeah, radiating waves of contempt.
- You asked me who I found attractive.

288
00:17:21,372 --> 00:17:22,414
That's true.

289
00:17:22,623 --> 00:17:26,126
She's your shiny apple. Now go
ask her if you can buy her a drink.

290
00:17:26,335 --> 00:17:28,420
What about the radiating waves
of contempt?

291
00:17:28,629 --> 00:17:31,799
That's just a defense mechanism
for a girl in a lot of pain.

292
00:17:32,007 --> 00:17:34,259
- Really?
- How the hell should I know?

293
00:17:35,427 --> 00:17:38,389
The point is, you can't let fear
stand in your way.

294
00:17:40,224 --> 00:17:43,477
- Well, I disagree.
- Are you questioning my methods?

295
00:17:43,686 --> 00:17:46,980
- Because we can stop right now.
- No, no, I'll do it. I'll do it.

296
00:17:50,484 --> 00:17:52,194
Would you like some more pretzels?

297
00:17:52,569 --> 00:17:56,323
Well, I am in the mood
for something salty and twisted.

298
00:17:56,532 --> 00:17:59,701
- You're terrible.
- You have no idea.

299
00:18:04,039 --> 00:18:07,543
- How'd it go?
- She's really got a mouth on her.

300
00:18:07,751 --> 00:18:09,044
So she rejected you?

301
00:18:09,253 --> 00:18:11,547
With anatomical specificity.

302
00:18:12,131 --> 00:18:14,591
- Good.
- Good? How is that good?

303
00:18:14,967 --> 00:18:17,594
- How do you feel now?
- What do you mean, how do I feel?

304
00:18:17,803 --> 00:18:19,471
- I feel humiliated.
- Where?

305
00:18:19,847 --> 00:18:21,515
- What?
- Where is the humiliation?

306
00:18:21,723 --> 00:18:24,935
- Where do you feel it?
- Oh, well, let's see.

307
00:18:25,144 --> 00:18:29,189
My stomach's all knotted, my heart is
pounding, I'm sweating like a pig.

308
00:18:29,398 --> 00:18:30,899
Okay, end of lesson one.

309
00:18:31,108 --> 00:18:34,236
That was lesson one?
Lesson one sucked.

310
00:18:34,778 --> 00:18:37,739
Lesson two: Have a drink.

311
00:18:38,323 --> 00:18:40,784
No, sweetheart, have a real drink.

312
00:18:43,162 --> 00:18:46,081
- I don't like Scotch.
- It's okay, it's bourbon.

313
00:18:46,290 --> 00:18:47,749
Oh, all right.

314
00:18:52,671 --> 00:18:54,298
More.

315
00:18:58,802 --> 00:18:59,928
How do you feel now?

316
00:19:01,096 --> 00:19:03,640
- I feel a little better.
- Finish the drink.

317
00:19:04,057 --> 00:19:06,143
Can I put some diet Sprite in it?

318
00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:08,562
Just finish it.

319
00:19:13,358 --> 00:19:16,111
There you go. Now how do you feel?

320
00:19:18,113 --> 00:19:19,364
I feel pretty good.

321
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:24,536
Like, to hell with her.
Who cares what she thinks?

322
00:19:24,745 --> 00:19:26,455
Perfect.

323
00:19:26,663 --> 00:19:29,958
Now go ask that chick over there
if you can buy her a drink.

324
00:19:30,334 --> 00:19:33,587
Wait a minute. Wait a minute,
that's your big secret? Alcohol?

325
00:19:34,963 --> 00:19:37,007
Don't tell anybody.

326
00:19:38,175 --> 00:19:42,679
- lsn't that just a temporary solution?
- It's only temporary if you stop drinking.

327
00:19:44,139 --> 00:19:45,557
I like it.

328
00:19:49,311 --> 00:19:51,688
Diet Sprite.

329
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:01,156
I gotta hand it to you, Alan.

330
00:20:01,365 --> 00:20:04,868
Most guys would be off scallops
for a long time.

331
00:20:05,953 --> 00:20:07,704
I like scallops.

332
00:20:07,913 --> 00:20:10,415
But clearly they don't like you.

333
00:20:10,624 --> 00:20:13,961
I guess you choose your seafood
like you choose your women.

334
00:20:14,169 --> 00:20:15,462
I beg to differ.

335
00:20:15,671 --> 00:20:19,633
When it comes to women,
I make them sick.

336
00:20:22,552 --> 00:20:24,179
Fair enough.

337
00:20:24,388 --> 00:20:26,682
So, what else did we learn tonight?

338
00:20:26,890 --> 00:20:29,017
Well, let's see.

339
00:20:29,226 --> 00:20:33,188
I learned that to overcome my fear
of rejection ingrained in me...

340
00:20:33,397 --> 00:20:35,774
by an emotionally distant mother...

341
00:20:35,982 --> 00:20:39,319
I need to completely disable
my central nervous system...

342
00:20:39,528 --> 00:20:42,864
with semi-lethal quantities
of alcohol.

343
00:20:43,532 --> 00:20:45,367
Bravo.

00:20:46,868 --> 00:20:48,954
Hey, Charlie, are you coming to bed
or what?

345
00:20:49,371 --> 00:20:50,831
I'll be there in a second.

346
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:54,459
- What're you looking at?
- Sorry. Very sorry.

347
00:20:55,877 --> 00:20:57,671
So how've you been?

348
00:21:01,299 --> 00:21:02,509
It worked.

349
00:21:02,718 --> 00:21:05,679
I am totally humiliated
and I don't care.

350
00:21:07,055 --> 00:21:09,433
You made real progress tonight.
I'm proud of you.

351
00:21:09,641 --> 00:21:13,812
Thanks, Charlie. You're a good teacher
and a good brother.

352
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:15,730
Thanks.

353
00:21:18,233 --> 00:21:22,612
Well, I guess it's time for me
to go work out my issues.

354
00:21:25,991 --> 00:21:27,492
Good night, pal.

355
00:21:27,701 --> 00:21:29,494
Nighty-night.
