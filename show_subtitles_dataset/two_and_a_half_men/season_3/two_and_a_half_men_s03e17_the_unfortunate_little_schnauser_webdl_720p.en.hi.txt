1
00:00:02,630 --> 00:00:05,466
So any thoughts on what
you'd like for dinner this weekend?

2
00:00:05,633 --> 00:00:08,802
You decide, honey.
I love everything you cook.

3
00:00:09,345 --> 00:00:10,846
All of a sudden I'm a woman...

4
00:00:11,013 --> 00:00:13,974
because I cook and try to make
a nice home for you?

5
00:00:14,725 --> 00:00:16,435
Okay, I heard it too. Shut up.

6
00:00:17,186 --> 00:00:19,938
Ramming speed!

7
00:00:20,981 --> 00:00:22,816
- Jake.
- Leave him alone.

8
00:00:22,983 --> 00:00:26,904
With his grades, he might as well get
used to pushing shopping carts around.

9
00:00:27,613 --> 00:00:29,907
My son is gonna
end up working in a supermarket?

10
00:00:30,074 --> 00:00:32,660
No, I'm saying he's probably
gonna end up homeless.

11
00:00:34,161 --> 00:00:37,456
Well, as I live and breathe,
Charlie Harper.

12
00:00:40,125 --> 00:00:42,044
Oh, great. Archie.

13
00:00:42,544 --> 00:00:45,339
So how's the best jingle writer
in the business?

14
00:00:45,506 --> 00:00:47,633
Looks like he's put on a few pounds.

15
00:00:48,509 --> 00:00:49,718
This is my brother Alan.

16
00:00:49,885 --> 00:00:52,388
Alan, Archie Baldwin,
the king of the jingle writers.

17
00:00:52,554 --> 00:00:54,014
Well, I don't know about that.

18
00:00:54,181 --> 00:00:57,226
More like the ayatollah
of the jingle writers.

19
00:00:57,559 --> 00:00:59,686
The grand Pooh-Bah, if you will.

20
00:01:00,521 --> 00:01:02,314
Really?
What's that make you, Charlie?

21
00:01:02,481 --> 00:01:04,983
T o be honest, a little nauseous.

22
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:07,945
We should get together sometime.
Maybe collaborate.

23
00:01:08,112 --> 00:01:11,198
- I'd like that.
- Well, sure, there's no downside for you.

24
00:01:13,659 --> 00:01:16,286
What the hell, remind me about it
at the awards dinner.

25
00:01:16,453 --> 00:01:18,122
Oh, I'm not going to that.

26
00:01:18,288 --> 00:01:19,665
Why not? You're nominated.

27
00:01:19,832 --> 00:01:21,458
Wait, what are you nominated for?

28
00:01:21,625 --> 00:01:24,711
It's a silly advertising award.
Doesn't mean anything.

29
00:01:24,878 --> 00:01:28,715
Yeah, he's right. It's not about
the trophies, it's about the work.

30
00:01:28,882 --> 00:01:31,718
PS, my work has won seven trophies.

31
00:01:33,345 --> 00:01:35,931
Hey, one more, I'll have a menorah.

32
00:01:37,015 --> 00:01:39,560
Well, good luck, Archie.
But I think I'll pass.

33
00:01:39,726 --> 00:01:42,062
Oh, well, good for you.
Stay home and sulk.

34
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:44,273
Nice meeting you.

35
00:01:44,439 --> 00:01:49,027
Okay, where do they keep
the extra-large condoms?

36
00:01:51,071 --> 00:01:52,948
Boy, he's a piece of work.

37
00:01:53,115 --> 00:01:55,284
He's a piece of something.

38
00:01:55,450 --> 00:01:57,953
How come you never
mentioned that whole award thing?

39
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,872
I've been nominated plenty of times.

40
00:02:00,038 --> 00:02:02,916
- How many times have you won?
- What difference does it make?

41
00:02:03,083 --> 00:02:04,418
So never.

42
00:02:05,085 --> 00:02:06,420
Yes, Alan, never.

43
00:02:06,587 --> 00:02:09,423
But that guy Archie
has won like seven times.

44
00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:11,216
Yes, he has.

45
00:02:12,342 --> 00:02:14,344
That's gotta sting.

46
00:02:15,179 --> 00:02:18,807
Hey, Alan, you ever been beaten
to death with a can of corn?

47
00:03:05,145 --> 00:03:07,272
Toe-Zene shouldn 't be used
by pregnant women...

48
00:03:07,439 --> 00:03:10,400
people with heart conditions
or taking SSI inhibitors.

49
00:03:15,196 --> 00:03:18,199
I don't know. This could be my year.

50
00:03:19,284 --> 00:03:22,704
- I really think it's your best work.
- Thanks.

51
00:03:22,871 --> 00:03:25,498
I know I said the same thing
about Mr. Herpes Lip Balm.

52
00:03:25,790 --> 00:03:26,833
Yeah.

53
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,460
Just Like a Woman Natural Douche.

54
00:03:29,627 --> 00:03:32,505
And that hemorrhoid cream.
What was it called?

55
00:03:33,798 --> 00:03:35,800
Fire in the Hole.

56
00:03:37,385 --> 00:03:39,220
Yeah, that was good.

57
00:03:39,387 --> 00:03:42,849
But Toe-Zene is the one
that's finally gonna bring home the gold.

58
00:03:43,016 --> 00:03:45,852
- Thanks for your support, Rose.
- You're welcome.

59
00:03:46,019 --> 00:03:48,271
Now, can you do something for me?

60
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:51,232
No.

61
00:03:52,609 --> 00:03:54,152
Oh, come on, Charlie.

62
00:03:54,777 --> 00:03:57,405
I want you to talk to my boyfriend.

63
00:03:57,572 --> 00:03:59,908
Why would I wanna talk
to your boyfriend?

64
00:04:00,074 --> 00:04:01,910
Because he's smothering me.

65
00:04:02,076 --> 00:04:05,663
And not in the good "can you move
your thigh off my face" kind of way.

66
00:04:08,333 --> 00:04:09,584
I need my space, Charlie.

67
00:04:09,751 --> 00:04:12,503
I wake up in the morning
and there he is staring at me.

68
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:15,757
I have a bowl of soup
and there he is blowing on it for me.

69
00:04:15,924 --> 00:04:17,091
Even when we have sex...

70
00:04:17,258 --> 00:04:20,553
I can feel his eyes
burning a hole in the back of my head.

71
00:04:22,138 --> 00:04:24,849
Oh, that's gonna keep me up at night.

72
00:04:25,683 --> 00:04:31,481
You need to explain to him that if you
love someone, you have to let them go.

73
00:04:31,648 --> 00:04:33,441
If they come back, they're yours.

74
00:04:33,608 --> 00:04:36,486
If they don't, then you stalk them.

75
00:04:36,945 --> 00:04:39,447
I really don't wanna get involved
in your love life.

76
00:04:39,614 --> 00:04:43,409
Well, if someone doesn't talk to him,
we're gonna have to break up.

77
00:04:44,077 --> 00:04:46,120
Do what you have to do.

78
00:04:46,287 --> 00:04:48,247
Oh, I get it.

79
00:04:48,414 --> 00:04:50,249
You want me to be single again.

80
00:04:53,252 --> 00:04:54,796
Get him over here.

81
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:57,215
Thank you.

82
00:04:57,382 --> 00:04:59,300
Was that so hard?

83
00:05:12,897 --> 00:05:15,566
I had no idea these awards
were so prestigious.

84
00:05:16,109 --> 00:05:18,611
They're meaningless crap.

85
00:05:18,945 --> 00:05:22,323
Come on. Look at this list
of past winners for best jingle.

86
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:25,118
Barry Manilow, Randy Newman,
Kenny Loggins...

87
00:05:25,284 --> 00:05:29,747
Archie Baldwin, Archie Baldwin
Archie Baldwin, Archieâ€”

88
00:05:29,914 --> 00:05:31,165
What's your point?

89
00:05:31,332 --> 00:05:33,793
My point is
it's an honor just to be nominated.

90
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:36,212
No, no, it's an honor to win.

91
00:05:36,379 --> 00:05:40,508
Being nominated
is just a soul-sucking waste of time.

92
00:05:40,883 --> 00:05:42,677
Why are you so sure
you're gonna lose?

93
00:05:42,844 --> 00:05:45,012
It doesn't matter
who wrote the best jingle...

94
00:05:45,179 --> 00:05:47,473
it's about
who has the sexiest product.

95
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:50,351
That's why the awards
always go to car and beer ads.

96
00:05:50,518 --> 00:05:53,146
Over-the-counter medications
just aren't hip enough.

97
00:05:54,897 --> 00:05:57,358
- That hardly seems fair.
- Tell me about it.

98
00:05:57,525 --> 00:06:01,404
Encourage people to get drunk
and drive fast, great, here's an award.

99
00:06:01,571 --> 00:06:04,907
Relieve the heartbreak
of vaginal itching?

100
00:06:06,617 --> 00:06:08,828
They don't even wanna
shake your hand.

101
00:06:10,329 --> 00:06:12,999
Well, win or lose,
you should still go to the ceremony.

102
00:06:13,166 --> 00:06:16,043
No, no, no. No. An awards
ceremony is like a Thai massage.

103
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:20,047
If you don't know that there's gonna be
a happy ending, no point in lying down.

104
00:06:20,214 --> 00:06:23,176
You have a family who's proud
of your accomplishments...

105
00:06:23,342 --> 00:06:25,386
and might like the chance
to share them.

106
00:06:25,553 --> 00:06:27,096
What family is that?

107
00:06:27,263 --> 00:06:29,682
Your family: Me, Jake, Mom.

108
00:06:29,849 --> 00:06:32,560
Whoa, do not tell Mom
about this nomination.

109
00:06:32,727 --> 00:06:34,562
- It's a good thing.
- lt doesn't matter.

110
00:06:34,729 --> 00:06:37,356
If it's a good thing
she'll find a way to make it bad.

111
00:06:37,523 --> 00:06:40,026
- Okay, now you're just being ridiculous.
- Oh, really?

112
00:06:40,193 --> 00:06:41,652
Let's try a little experiment.

113
00:06:41,819 --> 00:06:44,155
I'll pretend I'm Mom,
you tell me something good.

114
00:06:44,947 --> 00:06:46,365
All right.

115
00:06:46,532 --> 00:06:48,993
Hey, Mom,
I have discovered a cure for cancer.

116
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:50,995
Very nice.

117
00:06:51,162 --> 00:06:54,957
Shame you couldn't do it in time
to save Uncle Walter's left testicle.

118
00:06:57,043 --> 00:06:58,502
Come on, give me another one.

119
00:06:59,003 --> 00:07:01,589
- No, I get the idea.
- No, no. no. Hit me.

120
00:07:01,756 --> 00:07:03,633
Okay.

121
00:07:04,050 --> 00:07:06,928
Gee, Mom,
it really is a beautiful day, huh?

122
00:07:07,094 --> 00:07:10,556
Try telling that
to Uncle Walter's one good nut.

123
00:07:12,725 --> 00:07:14,310
Okay.

124
00:07:14,477 --> 00:07:15,853
I adore my son.

125
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:17,730
Somebody has to.

126
00:07:21,525 --> 00:07:23,778
- How about friendship?
- How about Judas?

127
00:07:23,945 --> 00:07:25,071
- Family.
- Manson.

128
00:07:25,238 --> 00:07:26,280
- Puppies.
- Rabies.

129
00:07:26,447 --> 00:07:27,823
- Love.
- Communicable disease.

130
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:30,034
- You win.
- Quitter.

131
00:07:30,201 --> 00:07:32,036
- Leave me alone.
- You're already alone.

132
00:07:32,203 --> 00:07:34,622
Your wife threw you out, remember?

133
00:07:38,292 --> 00:07:41,087
Damn it, Gordon, get up there
and talk to Charlie.

134
00:07:41,253 --> 00:07:43,297
But I don't wanna talk to Charlie.

135
00:07:43,464 --> 00:07:45,466
Do you like having sex with me,
Gordon?

136
00:07:46,050 --> 00:07:47,426
Hey, Charlie.

137
00:07:47,593 --> 00:07:49,220
Hey, Gordon.

138
00:07:49,387 --> 00:07:51,305
- What's going on?
- Oh, not much.

139
00:07:51,472 --> 00:07:55,977
I was just passing by,
thought I'd see how you were doing.

140
00:07:56,811 --> 00:07:58,145
I'm doing fine.

141
00:07:58,312 --> 00:07:59,855
Good.

142
00:08:00,398 --> 00:08:02,191
Good.

143
00:08:04,902 --> 00:08:05,945
Nice shirt.

144
00:08:06,946 --> 00:08:08,197
Right back at you.

145
00:08:10,992 --> 00:08:12,702
So...

146
00:08:12,868 --> 00:08:16,580
Rose says I have to talk to you
or I can't have sex with her anymore.

147
00:08:16,789 --> 00:08:19,542
I see. You sure you're making
the right choice?

148
00:08:20,042 --> 00:08:21,627
Call me crazy.

149
00:08:21,836 --> 00:08:25,131
Well, crazy's the price of admission
for that ride.

150
00:08:25,756 --> 00:08:27,675
Okay, come here, sit down.

151
00:08:28,592 --> 00:08:30,928
- You want a beer?
- Oh, no, thank you.

152
00:08:31,137 --> 00:08:33,013
I'm a really mean drunk.

153
00:08:34,056 --> 00:08:35,933
I sensed that.

154
00:08:36,809 --> 00:08:39,729
Anyway, the thing you need
to understand about Rose...

155
00:08:39,895 --> 00:08:43,232
about any woman really, is
that they want what they can't have.

156
00:08:43,399 --> 00:08:44,859
But Rose can have me.

157
00:08:45,025 --> 00:08:46,235
Trust me on this, Gordon.

158
00:08:46,402 --> 00:08:48,738
You play it cool, keep your distance,
be aloof...

159
00:08:48,904 --> 00:08:51,282
you'll have to call the cops
to get rid of her.

160
00:08:51,449 --> 00:08:53,784
- You really think so?
- No, I know so.

161
00:08:54,452 --> 00:08:56,996
But they won't come right away.

162
00:08:57,538 --> 00:09:01,083
She'll still have time to hot-glue
her high school graduation picture...

163
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:03,711
to your freshly shaved ass.

164
00:09:12,344 --> 00:09:14,847
Hey, Mom, here's some good news.

165
00:09:15,014 --> 00:09:16,849
It seems with medical breakthroughs...

166
00:09:17,016 --> 00:09:20,227
the average life span
will soon be 100 years.

167
00:09:20,394 --> 00:09:23,272
Wonderful. More time to be ignored
by your children.

168
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,985
Amazing.

169
00:09:29,278 --> 00:09:31,614
Morning, Mom.
You're looking very pretty today.

170
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:34,700
That's nice, because inside I'm dead.

171
00:09:38,412 --> 00:09:39,955
When you're right, you're right.

172
00:09:40,122 --> 00:09:41,790
Charlie, I need a favor.

173
00:09:41,957 --> 00:09:46,086
Yeah, well, I need a healthy liver,
and there's a long waiting list for both.

174
00:09:46,629 --> 00:09:48,964
I've got a client coming into town
next Saturday.

175
00:09:49,131 --> 00:09:52,927
- And he's bringing his lovely daughter.
- And by lovely she means dog-like.

176
00:09:54,303 --> 00:09:58,140
All right, she may not be a beauty queen,
but she does have a terrific figure.

177
00:09:58,307 --> 00:10:00,476
I'm guessing six nipples.

178
00:10:04,522 --> 00:10:07,816
Anyhow, I was hoping you could show
her a good time. No big deal.

179
00:10:07,983 --> 00:10:09,777
You don't have to take her to dinner.

180
00:10:09,944 --> 00:10:12,947
Go to the beach and throw a stick
till she gets tired.

181
00:10:14,448 --> 00:10:18,869
Gee, Mom, as much as I'd love to
service the unfortunate little schnauzer...

182
00:10:19,036 --> 00:10:21,330
- ... I'm busy next Saturday.
- What are you doing?

183
00:10:22,122 --> 00:10:24,917
Iâ€” I'veâ€” I've got aâ€” I've got a thing.

184
00:10:25,084 --> 00:10:28,087
Don't lie. You've got nothing,
you just don't want to help me.

185
00:10:28,254 --> 00:10:30,756
No, no, no. No, I swear, I have plans.

186
00:10:30,923 --> 00:10:34,760
I'm going to this awards ceremony.

187
00:10:34,927 --> 00:10:36,470
You never go to these things.

188
00:10:36,637 --> 00:10:38,389
Yeah, well, this year's different.

189
00:10:38,555 --> 00:10:42,309
Your client's daughter will just have
to hump somebody else's leg.

190
00:10:44,895 --> 00:10:47,356
I told you I could get him to go.

191
00:10:59,075 --> 00:11:00,619
This is really boring.

192
00:11:01,119 --> 00:11:03,038
Just keep it to yourself, Jake.

193
00:11:03,205 --> 00:11:05,373
I just don't understand
why I had to come.

194
00:11:05,999 --> 00:11:08,001
You're here to support
your Uncle Charlie.

195
00:11:08,168 --> 00:11:11,004
The same way he supported you
at your Christmas pageant.

196
00:11:11,171 --> 00:11:14,257
The one where you stood
in back picking lint off your antlers...

197
00:11:14,424 --> 00:11:17,594
while the rest of the class recited
"The Night Before Kwanzaa. "

198
00:11:18,637 --> 00:11:20,388
Oh, yeah.

199
00:11:20,972 --> 00:11:22,849
- Uncle Charlie?
- What?

200
00:11:23,016 --> 00:11:25,602
Now you have to come
to my Easter pageant.

201
00:11:27,646 --> 00:11:30,857
- This event isn't televised, is it?
- No.

202
00:11:31,358 --> 00:11:33,902
Well, I guess they only show
the important awards.

203
00:11:37,405 --> 00:11:41,159
Congratulations, you've just been elected
tonight's designated driver.

204
00:11:44,454 --> 00:11:45,956
Come on, just ignore her.

205
00:11:46,498 --> 00:11:50,919
Ignore her? It'd be easier to ignore
blood in my urine.

206
00:11:51,127 --> 00:11:54,965
Well, well, well,
look who decided to be a good sport.

207
00:11:55,131 --> 00:11:56,716
Speaking of blood in my urine.

208
00:11:56,883 --> 00:11:58,510
Hey, Archie.

209
00:11:58,677 --> 00:12:00,387
Hey, I wanna tell you people...

210
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:02,722
this man has been a real inspiration
to me.

211
00:12:02,889 --> 00:12:04,599
- Oh, come on.
- No, no, I mean it.

212
00:12:04,766 --> 00:12:08,478
When I'm struggling to write a jingle
and I feel like I'm not measuring up...

213
00:12:08,645 --> 00:12:12,148
I ask myself,
"How would Charlie Harper write this? "

214
00:12:12,315 --> 00:12:15,986
And the answer always makes me feel
better about my own work.

215
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:20,532
Charlie, aren't you going
to introduce me?

216
00:12:20,991 --> 00:12:22,993
Mom, Archie. Archie, Mom.

217
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:24,995
You're Charlie's mother?

218
00:12:25,161 --> 00:12:28,498
Oh, a teenage pregnancy, no doubt.

219
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:32,502
How brave of you to keep him.

220
00:12:34,337 --> 00:12:35,839
Well, aren't you adorable.

221
00:12:36,631 --> 00:12:39,843
Mom. Archie is nominated
in the same category as Charlie.

222
00:12:40,010 --> 00:12:43,680
Oh, well, I'll be rooting for you,
Archie.

223
00:12:45,682 --> 00:12:48,393
- Okay, then, thanks for stopping by.
- Good luck.

224
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,770
- You deserve it this year.
- Thanks.

225
00:12:50,937 --> 00:12:52,897
I mean, how many times
can they snub you?

226
00:12:53,481 --> 00:12:56,276
- I don't really keep track.
- Seven.

227
00:12:58,069 --> 00:13:00,947
Seven years in a row.

228
00:13:01,156 --> 00:13:02,198
If you say so.

229
00:13:02,907 --> 00:13:05,076
Hey, stick around after the ceremony.

230
00:13:05,243 --> 00:13:07,078
If I win, I'll let you hold my trophy.

231
00:13:09,706 --> 00:13:12,876
Not to mention the little statue
they give me.

232
00:13:17,756 --> 00:13:20,008
Isn't the little statue the trophy?

233
00:13:20,675 --> 00:13:22,594
Just eat your chicken.

234
00:13:23,762 --> 00:13:26,097
Before we present
the Jingle of the Y ear Award...

235
00:13:26,264 --> 00:13:28,099
we have a special treat.

236
00:13:28,266 --> 00:13:31,186
Please tell me
they're gonna pass out guns.

237
00:13:31,352 --> 00:13:34,314
Our very own seven-time
award winner...

238
00:13:34,481 --> 00:13:36,983
here to perform
his own nominated tune...

239
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:40,820
composed especially for the United
Nations Save-an-Orphan programâ€”

240
00:13:40,987 --> 00:13:43,865
Oh, God, not orphans.

241
00:13:44,032 --> 00:13:45,575
Archie Baldwin.

242
00:13:46,117 --> 00:13:48,328
Oh, goodie.

243
00:13:51,206 --> 00:13:54,125
This is for all the orphans out there.

244
00:13:58,797 --> 00:14:03,176
There's no tree at Christmastime

245
00:14:03,343 --> 00:14:06,971
No pumpkin Hallow 's Eve

246
00:14:07,597 --> 00:14:12,060
No candles on the birthday cake

247
00:14:12,227 --> 00:14:17,273
No reason to believe

248
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:22,821
He works all day in a cold, dark mine

249
00:14:22,987 --> 00:14:26,574
His little lungs filled with soot

250
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:31,329
Her mommy's Kim Jong 's concubine

251
00:14:31,496 --> 00:14:35,917
Her dad was killed
By the Tonton Macoutes

252
00:14:36,084 --> 00:14:38,545
Save the orphans

253
00:14:41,047 --> 00:14:44,217
Save the orphans

254
00:14:47,762 --> 00:14:49,597
Don 't do it for me

255
00:14:49,764 --> 00:14:51,808
Don 't do it for you

256
00:14:52,392 --> 00:14:55,103
Do it for little Kim Sung

257
00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:56,646
And Abu

258
00:14:57,313 --> 00:15:00,483
Yeah, save the orphans

259
00:15:01,025 --> 00:15:02,819
Come on, everybody.

260
00:15:02,986 --> 00:15:06,072
Save the orphans

261
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:08,241
They' re tax-deductible.

262
00:15:08,408 --> 00:15:10,827
Save the orphans

263
00:15:10,994 --> 00:15:13,121
Get them while they' re still cute.

264
00:15:13,288 --> 00:15:15,081
Save the orphans

265
00:15:15,248 --> 00:15:17,667
Get them young,
teach them your tongue.

266
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:19,919
Save the orphans

267
00:15:20,086 --> 00:15:22,463
Woody Allen can't marry them all.

268
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:24,674
Save the orphans

269
00:15:24,841 --> 00:15:27,176
Some of them
don't even have parents.

270
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:29,595
Save the orphans

271
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:32,473
Get two, get one free.

272
00:15:32,849 --> 00:15:35,310
Save the orphans

273
00:15:35,476 --> 00:15:37,478
Use them as bait for scholarships.

274
00:15:37,645 --> 00:15:39,772
Save the orphans

275
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:42,442
Save the orphans

276
00:15:44,819 --> 00:15:47,822
Save the orphans

277
00:15:47,989 --> 00:15:49,782
Enough.

278
00:15:50,658 --> 00:15:52,243
Come on. It's catchy.

279
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:54,787
So is diphtheria.

280
00:15:55,538 --> 00:15:57,874
How come you don't get
a runner-up trophy?

281
00:15:58,041 --> 00:15:59,208
Because I don't.

282
00:15:59,584 --> 00:16:02,295
At school everybody gets a trophy
just for participating.

283
00:16:03,087 --> 00:16:06,799
Well, Jake, that's the difference
between school and life.

284
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:12,055
In life all you get for participating is pain,
loneliness and death.

285
00:16:13,765 --> 00:16:16,100
Better luck next year, Charlie.

286
00:16:16,267 --> 00:16:18,644
Good night, boys.

287
00:16:24,358 --> 00:16:26,527
Oh, yeah, I forgot.

288
00:16:26,694 --> 00:16:29,906
There's also crushing humiliation.

289
00:16:31,908 --> 00:16:34,994
Well, in sixth grade, you get a trophy.

290
00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:44,879
Hey, can I get you anything?

291
00:16:46,172 --> 00:16:49,425
A length of rope and a rickety stool?

292
00:16:50,551 --> 00:16:54,472
Charlie, it's understandable that you
might be a little blue right now...

293
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:56,516
but that will pass.

294
00:16:57,308 --> 00:16:59,477
Get out of here, Alan.

295
00:16:59,644 --> 00:17:04,690
You know, I often find that
when things look darkest...

296
00:17:05,274 --> 00:17:07,026
it really helps to share yourâ€”

297
00:17:07,193 --> 00:17:10,071
I swear, I will drop-kick you
over that railing.

298
00:17:11,405 --> 00:17:12,865
Alrighty.

299
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:15,284
Pleasant dreams.

300
00:17:16,327 --> 00:17:19,247
You don't dream in a blackout,
you moron.

301
00:17:20,832 --> 00:17:24,043
- Hey, Charlie.
- Oh, God.

302
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:27,964
- How did it go tonight?
- Let me put it this way:

303
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:31,217
What the advertising community
did to me earlier this evening...

304
00:17:31,384 --> 00:17:33,928
Archie Baldwin is now doing
to my mother.

305
00:17:34,846 --> 00:17:37,348
He's not acknowledging
her wonderful talent?

306
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:41,143
- Just leave it alone, Rose.
- Sorry.

307
00:17:42,144 --> 00:17:43,771
Have you seen Gordon?

308
00:17:43,938 --> 00:17:45,731
Not since I talked to him.

309
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:48,025
And by the way,
thanks for that opportunity.

310
00:17:48,484 --> 00:17:52,280
I've always wanted to bond
with a pasty kid who dresses like me.

311
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:57,118
Well, I don't know what you said to him,
but he's been acting very strange lately.

312
00:17:57,910 --> 00:17:59,662
Lately?

313
00:17:59,829 --> 00:18:02,164
I keep calling,
but he doesn't pick up the phone.

314
00:18:02,331 --> 00:18:04,959
And when I leave a message,
he doesn't call back.

315
00:18:05,626 --> 00:18:07,962
I thought you wanted him to stop
being so clingy.

316
00:18:08,129 --> 00:18:09,922
I thought I did too.

317
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:12,383
Now I miss his cute little face
peeking at me...

318
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:16,554
while I'm washing my hair, shaving my
legs, soaping up my breasts...

319
00:18:16,721 --> 00:18:20,850
which you no doubt remember
are extremely firm and perky.

320
00:18:21,517 --> 00:18:23,978
So he spies on you in the shower?

321
00:18:24,645 --> 00:18:26,772
No, that would be weird.

322
00:18:29,692 --> 00:18:31,652
Why is love so complicated?

323
00:18:32,194 --> 00:18:33,779
I don't know, Rose.

324
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:35,740
Stuff happens.

325
00:18:36,282 --> 00:18:40,661
Oh, Charlie, you always know
the right thing to say.

326
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:44,790
This is a fine kettle of fish.

327
00:18:45,624 --> 00:18:48,878
Oh, why can't I just black out
in peace?

328
00:18:49,045 --> 00:18:51,630
"Be aloof," you said,
"play hard to get. "

329
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:54,800
You just wanted me out of your way
so you could make your move.

330
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:56,010
You caught me, Gordon.

331
00:18:56,177 --> 00:18:58,346
Now, do the right thing and kill me.

332
00:19:00,514 --> 00:19:02,850
Oh, Charlie, is this true?

333
00:19:03,017 --> 00:19:06,145
Is this part of some devious plan
to win me back?

334
00:19:06,771 --> 00:19:09,690
You heard her, Gordon. Kill me.

335
00:19:09,857 --> 00:19:13,486
Rose, you wanted him out of your hair.
I got him out of your hair.

336
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:17,865
- You wanted to get rid of me?
- No, I just need some space.

337
00:19:18,074 --> 00:19:20,576
You want space?
I'll give you all the space you want.

338
00:19:20,743 --> 00:19:22,870
- Fine.
- ln fact, I'll leave right now.

339
00:19:23,037 --> 00:19:25,664
Well, great.
I'll just stay here with Charlie.

340
00:19:26,832 --> 00:19:28,417
Nobody leaves.

341
00:19:28,584 --> 00:19:30,628
Nobody stays.

342
00:19:31,295 --> 00:19:33,714
Rose, get off me.

343
00:19:35,883 --> 00:19:38,469
Okay, now, everybody
listen carefully...

344
00:19:38,636 --> 00:19:42,473
because I'm pretty sure
I'm only gonna be able to say this once.

345
00:19:42,932 --> 00:19:44,517
Rose, think about it.

346
00:19:44,683 --> 00:19:47,686
Where are you gonna find a guy
who loves you as much as Gordon?

347
00:19:48,312 --> 00:19:53,317
And, Gordon, where are you gonna find
a girl, period.

348
00:19:54,944 --> 00:19:56,195
The man makes sense, Rose.

349
00:19:57,154 --> 00:19:58,823
You're damn right I make sense.

350
00:19:58,989 --> 00:20:02,284
If you kids don't patch things up,
you know what's gonna happen?

351
00:20:02,451 --> 00:20:05,788
You're gonna wind up old,
miserable and alone.

352
00:20:06,622 --> 00:20:07,998
He's right, Gordon.

353
00:20:08,165 --> 00:20:10,543
Look what happened to him.

354
00:20:11,335 --> 00:20:12,419
I love you, Rose.

355
00:20:13,087 --> 00:20:14,338
I love you too.

356
00:20:16,549 --> 00:20:18,926
Oh, good, a happy ending.

357
00:20:19,093 --> 00:20:20,594
Now, get the hell off my deck.

358
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,973
- Come on, Lambchop, let's go home.
- Hold on.

359
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:27,393
Climbing over the rail
is ridiculous and juvenile.

360
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:30,563
From now on, I wanna take the stairs.

361
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,315
Do you like having sex with me,
Gordon?

362
00:20:33,941 --> 00:20:35,776
Call me crazy.

363
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:44,201
And the real winner tonight...

364
00:20:44,368 --> 00:20:46,120
is Charlie Harper.

365
00:20:46,287 --> 00:20:47,746
A man with a heart so big...

366
00:20:47,913 --> 00:20:51,959
that he'd step outside of his own
misery to help two people in need.

367
00:20:52,126 --> 00:20:53,335
Alan, I'm warning you.

368
00:20:53,502 --> 00:20:55,880
I know you don't wanna hear this.
Let me tell you.

369
00:20:56,046 --> 00:20:59,633
The Archie Baldwins of this world
are soon forgotten.

370
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:03,012
It's people like you, people
who are selfless and generous...

371
00:21:03,178 --> 00:21:04,513
who will live on forever.

372
00:21:05,222 --> 00:21:06,849
Last chance.

373
00:21:07,683 --> 00:21:12,062
Oh, please, that grumpy-gus routine
does notâ€” Good night.
