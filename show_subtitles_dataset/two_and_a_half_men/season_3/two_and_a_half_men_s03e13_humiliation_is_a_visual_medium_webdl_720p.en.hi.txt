1
00:00:03,045 --> 00:00:05,756
I just wanna be clear
that I am here as a last resort.

2
00:00:05,923 --> 00:00:07,299
I understand.

3
00:00:07,466 --> 00:00:10,511
I don't have a lot of faith in psychiatry
as a science.

4
00:00:11,554 --> 00:00:14,598
I think some of the drugs you're pushing
are interesting.

5
00:00:15,975 --> 00:00:19,979
And I'm all for messing around
with brain chemistry.

6
00:00:20,438 --> 00:00:23,107
I mean, that's how
I got through high school.

7
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:28,571
But in my experience, popping pills
doesn't relieve social anxiety...

8
00:00:28,737 --> 00:00:32,658
quite as well as, say,
bourbon and Marvin Gaye.

9
00:00:33,325 --> 00:00:36,871
No, I get it. You're desperate,
and I'm full of hooey.

10
00:00:38,789 --> 00:00:43,169
So in the words of Marvin Gaye,
what's going on?

11
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:48,549
- Everything I say is confidential, right?
- Whatever you say stays in this room.

12
00:00:48,716 --> 00:00:50,009
Kind of like Vegas.

13
00:00:50,176 --> 00:00:52,553
Well, except there's no way
you're leaving here...

14
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:55,764
with more money
than when you came in.

15
00:00:56,557 --> 00:00:58,851
Yeah, like Vegas.

16
00:01:00,769 --> 00:01:04,857
Anyway, last night I'm out
with my stupid, lame-ass brother.

17
00:01:05,024 --> 00:01:08,319
Sounds like
you've got some anger towards him.

18
00:01:08,485 --> 00:01:10,779
Oh, you're good.

19
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:16,619
This is nice.
You and me, spending time together.

20
00:01:16,785 --> 00:01:19,580
- Why don't we do this more often?
- I don't have an answer.

21
00:01:19,747 --> 00:01:23,334
Well, me neither.
So how long till the movie starts?

22
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:24,919
About 20 minutes.

23
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:28,505
Y eah, sure, 20 minutes
not counting previews and ads...

24
00:01:28,672 --> 00:01:31,467
the popcorn and the giant pretzel
holding hands...

25
00:01:31,634 --> 00:01:35,471
the big soda drinking the little soda,
which, frankly, is cannibalism...

26
00:01:35,638 --> 00:01:38,557
and the reminder
to turn off your cell phones and shut up.

27
00:01:38,724 --> 00:01:42,061
But nobody does, because good manners
are just the latest casualty...

28
00:01:42,228 --> 00:01:44,939
in the ongoing collapse
of Western civilization.

29
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:47,566
I now have an answer.

30
00:01:50,152 --> 00:01:52,988
- I miss Jake.
- How can you miss him?

31
00:01:53,155 --> 00:01:55,574
We just dropped him off
at his friend's house.

32
00:01:55,741 --> 00:01:58,869
By the way, if you get tired
of those magazines under your bed...

33
00:01:59,036 --> 00:02:01,622
the kid's mom looked fairly doable.

34
00:02:01,789 --> 00:02:05,542
Forget the mom. Did you see how happy
Jake was spending the weekend away?

35
00:02:05,709 --> 00:02:06,919
Why would you think that?

36
00:02:07,086 --> 00:02:09,880
Just because he jumped out of the car
while it was moving?

37
00:02:10,047 --> 00:02:14,760
Alan, he was happy to see his friends.
Being away from you is just gravy.

38
00:02:14,927 --> 00:02:18,389
I know, I know. It's natural
for him to want to spend more time...

39
00:02:18,555 --> 00:02:20,474
with his peers than his parents.

40
00:02:20,641 --> 00:02:23,936
But all the same, it's sad.

41
00:02:24,103 --> 00:02:27,106
Yeah, sunrise, sunset.

42
00:02:28,732 --> 00:02:30,901
One day you're holding a baby
in your arms...

43
00:02:31,068 --> 00:02:34,238
and the next day he's off
hawking loogies and lighting farts...

44
00:02:34,405 --> 00:02:37,449
with a bunch of
Ritalin-addled sixth graders.

45
00:02:37,866 --> 00:02:40,035
Why do I bother
to share my feelings with you?

46
00:02:40,202 --> 00:02:42,621
I don't know.
It's not like I encourage it.

47
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:46,834
Oh, come on, so your kid
doesn't need you like he used to.

48
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,419
That's a good thing.

49
00:02:48,585 --> 00:02:51,422
You can spend your weekends
enjoying yourself.

50
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:55,718
That's true. I mean, there are things
I wanna do that I haven't had time for.

51
00:02:55,884 --> 00:02:57,803
Like that kid's mom.

52
00:02:57,970 --> 00:03:00,764
No, no, I mean like— Like reading.

53
00:03:00,931 --> 00:03:02,766
Finally cracking open the classics.

54
00:03:02,933 --> 00:03:06,478
Alan, if you wanna crack something
open, I recommend that kid's mom.

55
00:03:07,271 --> 00:03:08,522
No, no, I'm serious.

56
00:03:08,689 --> 00:03:11,567
You know, for years
I have been wishing that I had time...

57
00:03:11,734 --> 00:03:13,527
to read all the great books.

58
00:03:13,694 --> 00:03:18,699
You know, Dostoyevsky
and Hemingway...

59
00:03:18,866 --> 00:03:22,619
Faulkner and Dickens
and Shakespeare.

60
00:03:22,786 --> 00:03:23,871
And history, history.

61
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:28,250
U.S.-- U.S. history, world history,
the history of language.

62
00:03:28,417 --> 00:03:31,587
I mean, why doesn't anyone
speak Sumerian anymore?

63
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:35,841
I don't know,
because I haven't read the book.

64
00:03:36,925 --> 00:03:42,639
And, oh, poetry, poetry.
Byron and Keats and Shelley.

65
00:03:42,806 --> 00:03:44,433
And biographies.

66
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:48,312
Julius Caesar and Abraham Lincoln
and, oh, Groucho Marx.

67
00:03:48,479 --> 00:03:52,983
I mean— I mean, look at them all.
Look at them, they're mocking me.

68
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:54,651
I haven't read any of them.

69
00:03:54,818 --> 00:03:57,654
Okay, well, just pick one for now.

70
00:03:57,821 --> 00:03:59,740
Why bother? There's not enough time.

71
00:03:59,907 --> 00:04:02,534
There's too many books,
and there's not enough time.

72
00:04:02,701 --> 00:04:05,579
Maybe you just need a system.
Put a book next to the toilet.

73
00:04:05,746 --> 00:04:08,123
Every couple of days,
knock out a couple chapters.

74
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:10,626
No, no, it's too late for me.

75
00:04:10,792 --> 00:04:14,046
There's not enough
bowel movements left.

76
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:20,427
- Maybe you need to change your diet.
- No, it's hopeless.

77
00:04:20,594 --> 00:04:22,888
Jake will be grown up soon
and I'll be dead.

78
00:04:23,055 --> 00:04:24,932
And you know
what I'll have left behind?

79
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:28,810
A life of unfulfilled dreams,
a shelf of unread books...

80
00:04:28,977 --> 00:04:32,731
and three unopened seasons
of Six Feet Under on DVD.

81
00:04:35,734 --> 00:04:38,237
So, what are you doing tonight?

82
00:04:45,902 --> 00:04:46,945
All right.

83
00:04:47,111 --> 00:04:50,615
So your brother had a panic attack
in the middle of a bookstore.

84
00:04:51,115 --> 00:04:52,992
How'd that make you feel?

85
00:04:53,701 --> 00:04:56,871
What the hell do my feelings
have to do with anything?

86
00:04:57,038 --> 00:04:59,540
Why don't you just humor me?

87
00:05:00,375 --> 00:05:02,335
Well, I felt a little ashamed.

88
00:05:02,502 --> 00:05:05,129
Because you felt
that his behavior reflected on you?

89
00:05:05,296 --> 00:05:07,757
No, because I left him there.

90
00:05:08,841 --> 00:05:10,218
You left him?

91
00:05:11,219 --> 00:05:14,430
Not permanently.
I came back and got him...

92
00:05:14,597 --> 00:05:17,475
after he was all cried out
and it was time for the movie.

93
00:05:17,642 --> 00:05:19,227
So you still went to the movie?

94
00:05:19,394 --> 00:05:22,563
Yeah, I bought the tickets online.
They don't refund those.

95
00:05:29,779 --> 00:05:31,572
Red Vine?

96
00:05:32,532 --> 00:05:36,536
No, thank you. I am so sorry.
I don't know what came over me.

97
00:05:36,703 --> 00:05:40,123
Who among us hasn't collapsed,
weeping, in the middle of a bookstore...

98
00:05:40,289 --> 00:05:42,166
for no apparent reason?

99
00:05:42,667 --> 00:05:45,086
You know, I think
maybe I'd be better off at home.

100
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:47,588
So I'm supposed to miss the movie...

101
00:05:47,755 --> 00:05:50,299
just because
you had a nervous breakdown?

102
00:05:50,466 --> 00:05:52,093
Well, kind of.

103
00:05:52,552 --> 00:05:55,054
Don't you think
that's a little selfish, Alan?

104
00:05:56,139 --> 00:06:01,227
It's just, all of a sudden I felt crushed
by this unbelievable sense of grief...

105
00:06:01,394 --> 00:06:05,398
Iike my entire life has been an exercise
in pathetic futility.

106
00:06:05,565 --> 00:06:07,817
Well, I wouldn't rule it out.

107
00:06:09,193 --> 00:06:11,320
Come on, bunky, cheer up.
Have a Red Vine.

108
00:06:11,487 --> 00:06:13,114
I don't want a Red Vine.

109
00:06:13,281 --> 00:06:14,824
- Sno-Cap?
- No.

110
00:06:14,991 --> 00:06:16,534
- Raisinet?
- No.

111
00:06:16,701 --> 00:06:18,453
- Goobers?
- How much crap did you buy?

112
00:06:18,619 --> 00:06:20,204
They couldn't change a hundred.

113
00:06:23,791 --> 00:06:26,085
All right, I'll have a Junior Mint.

114
00:06:27,003 --> 00:06:28,504
I didn't get Junior Mints.

115
00:06:30,423 --> 00:06:33,342
Of course not. Story of my life.

116
00:06:33,509 --> 00:06:37,054
No Junior Mints for Alan.
Just Goobers.

117
00:06:37,221 --> 00:06:39,056
Goobers, Goobers, Goobers.

118
00:06:39,223 --> 00:06:42,268
- Dude, dude, you need to be quiet.
- Why? Why?

119
00:06:42,435 --> 00:06:45,730
The First Amendment gives me
the right to yell in a crowded theater.

120
00:06:45,897 --> 00:06:47,940
Goobers!

121
00:06:49,025 --> 00:06:50,526
Hey, look, movie quiz.

122
00:06:50,693 --> 00:06:53,696
- Let's play the movie quiz.
- I don't wanna play the movie quiz.

123
00:06:53,863 --> 00:06:56,449
- lt'll be fun. I'll bet you're good at it.
- All right.

124
00:06:56,616 --> 00:06:59,911
"Debra Winger and Richard Gere
starred in An Officer and a blank. "

125
00:07:00,077 --> 00:07:03,956
- Oh, please.
- You need a hint?

126
00:07:04,415 --> 00:07:07,335
- There's a hint in the corner.
- No, I don't need a hint.

127
00:07:07,501 --> 00:07:10,338
I know the answer.
Everybody here knows the answer.

128
00:07:10,504 --> 00:07:12,465
Everybody on the planet
knows the answer.

129
00:07:12,632 --> 00:07:15,301
- We're not stupid.
- Chill, chill.

130
00:07:15,468 --> 00:07:17,428
Oh, wait.
Oh, here's another brainteaser.

131
00:07:17,595 --> 00:07:20,056
"Steven Spielberg
directed this modern retelling...

132
00:07:20,223 --> 00:07:23,851
of the H.G. Wells classic
War of the blank. "

133
00:07:24,018 --> 00:07:27,188
- Couch. War of the Couch.
- Stop it.

134
00:07:27,355 --> 00:07:30,274
Oh, wait, no, no, I got it.
War of the Blow-It-Out- Your-Ass.

135
00:07:30,441 --> 00:07:33,236
You know what? Maybe you' re right.
Maybe we should go.

136
00:07:33,402 --> 00:07:34,862
Oh, wait, no, I know this one.

137
00:07:35,029 --> 00:07:37,949
"Johnny Depp cruised to success
in this comedy-action film...

138
00:07:38,115 --> 00:07:40,076
inspired by a Disneyland attraction. "

139
00:07:40,242 --> 00:07:42,703
Pirates of the Blow-It-Out- Your-Ass.

140
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:44,538
He's— He's behind on his reading.

141
00:07:44,705 --> 00:07:48,292
Oh, and let's not forget Judy Garland
in that immortal classic...

142
00:07:48,459 --> 00:07:52,171
The Wizard of Blow-It-Out- Your-Ass.

143
00:07:52,338 --> 00:07:56,300
That sounds like quite an episode.
Is your brother seeing a therapist?

144
00:07:56,467 --> 00:07:58,386
How would I know?

145
00:07:58,552 --> 00:08:01,389
He's your brother. He lives with you.

146
00:08:01,555 --> 00:08:03,224
So?

147
00:08:04,308 --> 00:08:06,602
All right, go ahead.

148
00:08:06,769 --> 00:08:09,814
Just because I took him in,
doesn't mean I listen to him.

149
00:08:09,981 --> 00:08:11,107
I understand.

150
00:08:11,273 --> 00:08:14,485
He just whines about the same crap
over and over.

151
00:08:14,652 --> 00:08:17,488
- Okay.
- It's not even interesting crap.

152
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:22,076
It's the crap
that bores the crap out of crap.

153
00:08:22,243 --> 00:08:24,745
I got it. It's crap. Go ahead.

154
00:08:24,912 --> 00:08:29,625
Thank you.
So we're driving home, and...

155
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:39,719
This seat is very comfortable.

156
00:08:39,885 --> 00:08:43,806
Genuine leather, nine-way adjustable,
lumbar support. It's...

157
00:08:43,973 --> 00:08:47,601
I wish I'd have spent a few extra bucks
and gotten the ejection package.

158
00:08:48,561 --> 00:08:52,523
- I said I was sorry.
- They don't refund those tickets, Alan.

159
00:08:55,151 --> 00:08:58,446
- I wanna go see Jake.
- Why? He's at a sleepover.

160
00:08:58,612 --> 00:09:01,532
I've just got this feeling
that he needs me.

161
00:09:01,699 --> 00:09:03,784
You mean
like some sort of telepathic thing?

162
00:09:03,951 --> 00:09:06,412
- Exactly.
- I see.

163
00:09:08,664 --> 00:09:10,791
- Did you know I was gonna do that?
- No.

164
00:09:10,958 --> 00:09:14,003
Then I wouldn't trust
your psychic powers.

165
00:09:14,628 --> 00:09:17,506
Oh, come on.
We can just stop by for a few minutes.

166
00:09:17,673 --> 00:09:20,801
We have time now,
since we decided to skip the movie.

167
00:09:20,968 --> 00:09:25,264
Oh, we decided that, did we? That's
the way it went down for you, huh?

168
00:09:25,431 --> 00:09:27,475
That's how
you interpret recent events?

169
00:09:28,309 --> 00:09:30,895
Settle down.
You're acting like a crazy person.

170
00:09:31,061 --> 00:09:35,774
Me? I'm acting like a crazy person?
Are you freaking kidding me?

171
00:09:35,941 --> 00:09:39,653
Listen to yourself.
You're getting a little scary right now.

172
00:09:41,989 --> 00:09:44,658
Okay, fine. You wanna see the kid,
we'll go see the kid.

173
00:09:44,825 --> 00:09:46,410
Thank you.

174
00:09:47,203 --> 00:09:48,746
Was that so hard?

175
00:09:55,044 --> 00:09:58,172
Charlie? The road.

176
00:10:02,468 --> 00:10:04,261
Please?

177
00:10:08,390 --> 00:10:09,892
You know, when you have kids...

178
00:10:10,059 --> 00:10:12,394
you find there's a deep,
spiritual connection.

179
00:10:12,561 --> 00:10:15,689
You feel an actual tug
when your child needs you.

180
00:10:15,856 --> 00:10:19,193
Interesting. What do you feel
when your brother hates you?

181
00:10:21,278 --> 00:10:23,155
Alan. Is everything okay?

182
00:10:23,322 --> 00:10:25,824
Oh, yeah, fine.
I just need to see Jake for a minute.

183
00:10:25,991 --> 00:10:28,285
- He's feeling a tug.
- A tug?

184
00:10:28,452 --> 00:10:31,413
Or it could be gas. We're not sure.

185
00:10:32,456 --> 00:10:33,958
Well, could you just call Jake?

186
00:10:34,124 --> 00:10:38,963
Jake, your father's here!
Put that down, Timmy!

187
00:10:39,129 --> 00:10:42,132
- What?
- I just wanted to see if you were okay.

188
00:10:43,676 --> 00:10:46,220
Oh, great, now I'm dead.
Thanks a lot.

189
00:10:47,012 --> 00:10:50,182
It doesn't count.
I was talking to my stupid dad.

190
00:10:51,892 --> 00:10:55,229
Well, it— It seems like
you've got everything under control here.

191
00:10:55,396 --> 00:10:57,147
Actually, I ran out of ice cream.

192
00:10:57,314 --> 00:11:00,442
Do you think you could keep an eye
on the kids for a few minutes?

193
00:11:00,609 --> 00:11:03,237
- Well—
- Thanks a million. I'll be right back.

194
00:11:14,331 --> 00:11:16,625
She ain't coming back.

195
00:11:17,042 --> 00:11:19,962
Three hours she was gone.

196
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:26,010
And when she finally came back,
she was reeking of Old Spice and pot.

197
00:11:26,176 --> 00:11:29,638
- I see.
- And she didn't even have any ice cream.

198
00:11:30,597 --> 00:11:33,017
All right, let's stop here for a minute...

199
00:11:33,183 --> 00:11:36,854
and talk in general
about your feelings towards women.

200
00:11:37,021 --> 00:11:39,106
No, thanks.

201
00:11:39,273 --> 00:11:41,275
- Rather discuss your childhood?
- Nope.

202
00:11:41,442 --> 00:11:44,403
- Father? Mother?
- Dead. Killed him.

203
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:47,906
- Would you like to discuss that?
- We just did.

204
00:11:48,615 --> 00:11:51,368
Charlie, I'm not sure
we're on the same page here.

205
00:11:51,535 --> 00:11:53,370
Have you ever been in therapy before?

206
00:11:53,954 --> 00:11:57,958
- Does massage therapy count?
- No.

207
00:11:58,125 --> 00:12:01,211
It's almost the same thing.
One-on-one with a strange woman...

208
00:12:01,378 --> 00:12:04,798
who charges you for the hour
and then only gives you 50 minutes?

209
00:12:06,508 --> 00:12:08,469
Why don't we just go back
to your story?

210
00:12:08,635 --> 00:12:11,096
Touch a nerve there, did l?

211
00:12:13,932 --> 00:12:15,184
Okay, okay.

212
00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:19,521
Well, Jake ignored his father
the entire time we were there, so...

213
00:12:19,938 --> 00:12:22,566
Alan was a little upset
when we got back in the car.

214
00:12:22,733 --> 00:12:26,028
He hates me. My only son hates me.

215
00:12:26,236 --> 00:12:29,823
He doesn't hate you. He just
didn't appreciate you telling his friends...

216
00:12:29,990 --> 00:12:33,118
that laser tag
can induce epileptic fits.

217
00:12:33,285 --> 00:12:35,370
- Well, it can.
- Be that as it may...

218
00:12:35,537 --> 00:12:39,041
you could've gotten your point across
without flopping on the floor...

219
00:12:39,208 --> 00:12:42,211
rolling your eyes up,
and pretending to swallow your tongue.

220
00:12:42,377 --> 00:12:46,256
Hey, hey.
A picture is worth a thous—

221
00:12:48,050 --> 00:12:49,134
Charlie, stop the car.

222
00:12:49,593 --> 00:12:50,761
- Why?
- I have to get out.

223
00:12:50,928 --> 00:12:53,555
- I'm feeling claustrophobic.
- There's no place to stop.

224
00:12:53,722 --> 00:12:56,683
- We have to stop!
- Where?

225
00:12:56,850 --> 00:12:59,353
I can't breathe. I can't breathe.
I have to get out.

226
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:03,232
- I have to get out now. Now, now, now.
- Okay, okay, hold on. Hold on.

227
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:07,819
The seat belt won't come off.

228
00:13:07,986 --> 00:13:09,947
- Just push the button.
- I can't, I can't.

229
00:13:10,113 --> 00:13:13,825
- lt won't come off. Help me.
- Okay, okay, move your hands.

230
00:13:17,663 --> 00:13:19,206
Okay.

231
00:13:19,748 --> 00:13:23,460
It's passing. It's— Yes. I'm okay.

232
00:13:23,627 --> 00:13:25,170
- No, you're not.
- What?

233
00:13:25,629 --> 00:13:26,755
- Get out.
- What?

234
00:13:26,922 --> 00:13:30,509
Get out now. Now, now, now.
Get out. Get out.

235
00:13:37,641 --> 00:13:39,768
That's better.

236
00:13:46,441 --> 00:13:49,695
So you just left your brother
on the side of the road?

237
00:13:50,487 --> 00:13:52,864
He couldn't believe it either.

238
00:13:53,991 --> 00:13:57,577
You should've seen his face
in the rear-view mirror.

239
00:13:57,744 --> 00:14:01,581
All right, Charlie, we've been talking
for quite a while, and I gotta tell you:

240
00:14:01,748 --> 00:14:04,459
I still don't understand
why you came to see me.

241
00:14:04,626 --> 00:14:05,836
You in a hurry?

242
00:14:07,337 --> 00:14:11,133
Doesn't that undermine your whole
pay-by-the-hour business model?

243
00:14:12,467 --> 00:14:15,304
- Go ahead.
- Thank you.

244
00:14:15,470 --> 00:14:19,349
So as I was driving away,
I decided I needed a little quiet time...

245
00:14:19,516 --> 00:14:22,185
for, you know,
reflection and meditation.

246
00:14:31,903 --> 00:14:35,198
- Hey.
- Hey. What took you so long?

247
00:14:36,033 --> 00:14:38,368
I was sure you'd come back.

248
00:14:39,745 --> 00:14:42,456
I guess that's case closed
on the telepathy stuff.

249
00:14:44,624 --> 00:14:48,837
- What are you drinking?
- I don't know, something soothing.

250
00:14:49,588 --> 00:14:52,090
- Kahlua and cream.
- He's kidding. Give him a beer.

251
00:14:52,257 --> 00:14:55,761
- Must you always embarrass me?
- Hey, I have had a traumatic night.

252
00:14:55,927 --> 00:14:58,513
I feel very exposed, vulnerable,
confused—

253
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:01,058
Y eah, yeah, yeah.
Okay, shut up, shut up, shut up.

254
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:04,436
- Hi.
- Hi.

255
00:15:04,603 --> 00:15:07,773
- Yeah, hi.
- Can we buy you ladies a drink?

256
00:15:07,939 --> 00:15:12,527
- No, thanks. We're already pretty blitzed.
- Boy, are we blitzed.

257
00:15:12,694 --> 00:15:13,820
Perfect.

258
00:15:15,322 --> 00:15:16,698
I'm Charlie. This is Alan.

259
00:15:16,865 --> 00:15:18,450
- Amy.
- Beth.

260
00:15:18,617 --> 00:15:21,036
Nice to meet you.
How's it going tonight?

261
00:15:21,203 --> 00:15:23,371
- Pretty good.
- We're blitzed.

262
00:15:24,873 --> 00:15:28,251
- How about you?
- Yeah, how you doing?

263
00:15:28,418 --> 00:15:31,880
- Oh, boy. Where to start?
- No one's talking to you.

264
00:15:32,047 --> 00:15:34,674
- What's the matter, Alan?
- Yeah, what's the matter?

265
00:15:34,841 --> 00:15:36,635
Well, you really wanna know?

266
00:15:36,802 --> 00:15:39,846
They don't. Trust me, you really don't.

267
00:15:40,013 --> 00:15:43,099
Well, maybe it's a late reaction
to the divorce.

268
00:15:43,266 --> 00:15:47,813
Maybe it's my son not needing me
so much now that he's growing up...

269
00:15:47,979 --> 00:15:50,190
but I think it's more than that.

270
00:15:50,357 --> 00:15:53,527
I think it's just life grinding me down,
and I just...

271
00:15:54,236 --> 00:15:56,154
I don't think I can take it anymore.

272
00:15:56,655 --> 00:15:59,950
- Oh, you poor baby.
- Poor, poor baby.

273
00:16:00,116 --> 00:16:02,577
- Tell us all about it.
- Yeah, tell us.

274
00:16:02,744 --> 00:16:05,622
Well, I was never a happy child.

275
00:16:05,789 --> 00:16:08,500
Oh, God, I was a miserable kid.

276
00:16:10,085 --> 00:16:13,046
And the only thing
that gave my life meaning was my son.

277
00:16:13,213 --> 00:16:15,131
At least you've got a son.

278
00:16:16,508 --> 00:16:19,386
I've got nothing, except...

279
00:16:19,553 --> 00:16:20,637
epilepsy.

280
00:16:22,138 --> 00:16:24,015
- Oh, no.
- Yeah, oh, no.

281
00:16:32,232 --> 00:16:35,694
So anyway,
there I was on my wedding day...

282
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:38,530
in front of the priest
and all our friends...

283
00:16:38,697 --> 00:16:41,491
flopping around on the altar
like an epileptic trout...

284
00:16:42,492 --> 00:16:44,327
when I heard her father say:

285
00:16:44,494 --> 00:16:48,248
"You can't marry this man.
He's damaged goods. "

286
00:16:48,415 --> 00:16:52,627
- Oh, gee.
- Yeah, oh, gee.

287
00:16:52,794 --> 00:16:55,463
That's when I realized
that all the money in the world—

288
00:16:55,630 --> 00:16:57,549
And I do have a lot.

289
00:16:58,133 --> 00:17:02,053
—can't replace that special tug
you feel...

290
00:17:03,847 --> 00:17:06,766
when someone loves you
unconditionally.

291
00:17:07,309 --> 00:17:09,936
- Look, Beth, the ocean.
- Oh, the ocean.

292
00:17:10,103 --> 00:17:11,604
- Let's go skinny-dipping.
- Yeah.

293
00:17:11,771 --> 00:17:14,399
- You wanna come?
- Yeah, come with us.

294
00:17:14,566 --> 00:17:18,653
I'd love to, but I'm too sad
and I might swallow my tongue.

295
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:24,826
You two go. Swim, splash, frolic.
Enjoy your healthy bodies.

296
00:17:24,993 --> 00:17:27,329
- Okay.
- Bye.

297
00:17:27,996 --> 00:17:29,414
Have you no shame?

298
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:32,709
Let me think. Nope, just a tug.

299
00:17:32,876 --> 00:17:35,128
And that's another thing.
My angst is real.

300
00:17:35,295 --> 00:17:38,298
I don't appreciate you taking my tug
to get in someone's pants.

301
00:17:38,465 --> 00:17:42,093
News flash, Alan.
They're already out of their pants.

302
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:45,764
And they're gonna come back cold, wet
and in desperate need of body heat.

303
00:17:45,930 --> 00:17:50,101
For those of us with normal skin
temperature, it'll be a seller's market.

304
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:52,729
- You're unbelievable.
- No, I just think ahead.

305
00:17:52,896 --> 00:17:55,899
They're gonna last two seconds
in that water. We have to hurry.

306
00:17:56,066 --> 00:17:58,068
I'll get the wine.
You light some candles.

307
00:17:58,234 --> 00:18:00,904
I'm sorry, I'm really not in the mood.

308
00:18:01,071 --> 00:18:05,325
Are you saying that I have to
get you liquored up so I can get laid?

309
00:18:06,076 --> 00:18:08,703
All right, I'll go along,
but only as a favor to you.

310
00:18:08,870 --> 00:18:10,538
Thank you.

311
00:18:11,372 --> 00:18:13,166
I'm gonna have to apply the condom...

312
00:18:13,333 --> 00:18:16,669
and get a rope and pulley
to lower one of those broads onto him.

313
00:18:19,130 --> 00:18:21,883
Since you're making me do this,
I get Amy.

314
00:18:22,050 --> 00:18:24,969
The hell you do. Which one's Amy?

315
00:18:25,887 --> 00:18:28,306
Amy's the one
who overcame the eating disorder.

316
00:18:28,473 --> 00:18:33,061
- Starving herself or throwing up?
- Does it make a difference?

317
00:18:33,603 --> 00:18:36,731
- Does if you're paying for dinner.
- Amy is the brunette.

318
00:18:36,898 --> 00:18:40,360
- Got it. So I have Jennifer.
- You mean Beth.

319
00:18:40,527 --> 00:18:44,656
- Oh, right, right, B for "blonde. "
- B can also be for "brunette. "

320
00:18:44,823 --> 00:18:48,660
But Amy's the brunette.
So you could do A for "anorexic. "

321
00:18:48,827 --> 00:18:51,329
Unless it's B for "bulimic. "

322
00:18:52,121 --> 00:18:54,958
Good point.
We're gonna need a new system.

323
00:18:55,583 --> 00:18:57,293
Do you smell something?

324
00:18:57,460 --> 00:19:00,338
Yeah, what is that?

325
00:19:06,261 --> 00:19:08,888
I think you do these things
just to piss me off.

326
00:19:11,975 --> 00:19:15,311
- Oh, my God, what happened?
- Well, while I was trying to put it out...

327
00:19:15,478 --> 00:19:18,106
my brother
stupidly called the fire department.

328
00:19:18,273 --> 00:19:19,357
Why was that stupid?

329
00:19:19,524 --> 00:19:22,694
Have you seen
a Malibu fireman recently?

330
00:19:23,236 --> 00:19:27,365
They're all young, buff surfer dudes
whipping their big hoses around.

331
00:19:29,450 --> 00:19:32,870
Amy and Beth jumped on their
hook and ladder like a couple Dalmatians.

332
00:19:33,037 --> 00:19:35,415
We never saw them again.

333
00:19:35,832 --> 00:19:37,542
Yes, the Malibu Fire Department.

334
00:19:37,709 --> 00:19:41,713
I have several patients who compulsively
masturbate to their calendar.

335
00:19:41,879 --> 00:19:44,507
- No kidding.
- Both sexes.

336
00:19:45,633 --> 00:19:47,302
So, Charlie, I'm still not clear...

337
00:19:47,468 --> 00:19:49,971
on what it is
you would like me to help you with.

338
00:19:50,138 --> 00:19:54,058
Your anger issues?
Your sexual issues? Drinking?

339
00:19:54,225 --> 00:19:56,644
No, no, no, that's all cool.

340
00:19:56,811 --> 00:20:00,481
Then tell me, why are you here?

341
00:20:00,648 --> 00:20:04,611
Okay, well, I'm here
to lay some groundwork for the future.

342
00:20:04,777 --> 00:20:06,237
Some groundwork?

343
00:20:06,404 --> 00:20:09,324
Yeah. I've come to realize
that there's a very good chance...

344
00:20:09,490 --> 00:20:12,410
that I might someday snap
and kill my brother.

345
00:20:14,746 --> 00:20:17,832
And I figure if I'm
already under a psychiatrist's care...

346
00:20:17,999 --> 00:20:20,793
then I can always
cop an insanity plea.

347
00:20:21,586 --> 00:20:24,589
You're thinking of killing your brother?

348
00:20:28,092 --> 00:20:31,387
Doctor-patient confidentiality.

349
00:20:38,686 --> 00:20:39,979
Where's the bottle opener?

350
00:20:40,145 --> 00:20:42,565
Check in the drawer
by the coffee machine.

351
00:20:42,731 --> 00:20:45,401
Hey, what do you think of this
for the new drapes?

352
00:20:46,694 --> 00:20:48,445
T oo small.

353
00:20:49,071 --> 00:20:53,576
You know, I think it's kind of cheerful.
I'll put it in the "maybe" pile.

354
00:20:54,368 --> 00:20:56,370
You do that.

355
00:20:57,162 --> 00:20:59,874
You know, we're also
gonna have to reupholster the couch.

356
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:02,209
- You think?
- There's a lot of water damage.

357
00:21:02,376 --> 00:21:06,547
Which, frankly, I think was the result
of the firemen showing off for the girls.

358
00:21:06,714 --> 00:21:08,591
You could be right.

359
00:21:10,342 --> 00:21:12,052
You know, I just wanna tell you...

360
00:21:12,219 --> 00:21:16,015
I really appreciate you sticking by me
in the past couple of days...

361
00:21:16,181 --> 00:21:18,058
you know,
pulling me out of my funk.

362
00:21:18,225 --> 00:21:20,644
You really are a great brother.

363
00:21:21,604 --> 00:21:25,691
- I don't know what I'd do without you.
- I don't know what I'd do without you.

364
00:21:28,777 --> 00:21:33,198
But golly, it's sure fun to think about.

365
00:21:57,848 --> 00:21:59,933
