1
00:00:02,555 --> 00:00:04,306
I'm sure she's a lovely girl, Mom...

2
00:00:04,473 --> 00:00:07,435
but I have a strict policy
against blind dates.

3
00:00:07,601 --> 00:00:12,398
Yes, I know I'm not God's gift
to women, but nevertheless.

4
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:16,360
Oh, come on, how do you know what
she can suck through a garden hose?

5
00:00:18,487 --> 00:00:20,531
It doesn't matter, the policy stands.

6
00:00:20,698 --> 00:00:22,533
Okay, bye.

7
00:00:23,117 --> 00:00:25,578
You know, while I applaud
your blind date policy...

8
00:00:25,744 --> 00:00:29,290
I would encourage you to consider
a garden hose exemption.

9
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:32,793
I'm sorry, but you remember
the last time I let Mom fix me up.

10
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:35,337
Oh, yeah, the enema freak.

11
00:00:35,963 --> 00:00:38,883
She was a colonic irrigation therapist.

12
00:00:39,049 --> 00:00:41,802
Tomato, tomahto.

13
00:00:42,344 --> 00:00:46,015
You still wound up with five gallons
of coffee up your keister.

14
00:00:46,724 --> 00:00:48,392
Not a pleasant memory.

15
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:51,103
Oh, I can't remember it
without chuckling.

16
00:00:52,188 --> 00:00:55,149
These days they'll open
a Starbucks anywhere.

17
00:00:55,649 --> 00:00:58,569
- Are you done?
- No, wait, one more.

18
00:00:59,069 --> 00:01:02,031
You had the Venti nonfat
crap-puccino...

19
00:01:04,241 --> 00:01:05,743
with extra foam.

20
00:01:08,204 --> 00:01:09,830
No, okay, I'm done.

21
00:01:09,997 --> 00:01:11,624
So, what's wrong with the TV?

22
00:01:11,749 --> 00:01:15,544
The storm last night messed up the
satellite dish. I'll call the guy on Monday.

23
00:01:16,045 --> 00:01:18,422
That's your answer for everything.
"Call the guy. "

24
00:01:18,631 --> 00:01:22,051
Not for everything.
Often, I'll call the girl.

25
00:01:22,927 --> 00:01:26,764
Of course there was the one time
that the girl turned out to be the guy.

26
00:01:27,181 --> 00:01:29,892
Needless to say,
I got a full cash refund.

27
00:01:30,559 --> 00:01:32,645
You don't have to call
the guy this time.

28
00:01:32,811 --> 00:01:35,064
You adjust the dish
till the signal clears up.

29
00:01:35,189 --> 00:01:37,399
Which is what the guy
will do on Monday.

30
00:01:37,566 --> 00:01:38,901
But Jake is coming tonight.

31
00:01:39,068 --> 00:01:42,196
Do you wanna listen to him complain
about the TV all weekend?

32
00:01:42,363 --> 00:01:45,824
I can deal with Jake. It's your whining
that makes me wanna hang myself.

33
00:01:46,241 --> 00:01:47,785
Come on, help me get the ladder.

34
00:01:47,952 --> 00:01:50,621
I'll go up on the roof
and we'll fix it in five minutes.

35
00:01:51,497 --> 00:01:52,957
I have a ladder?

36
00:01:55,542 --> 00:01:57,670
How did I get a ladder?

37
00:01:58,295 --> 00:02:01,423
For the life of me,
I can't remember buying a ladder.

38
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:03,634
Well, apparently you did.

39
00:02:03,801 --> 00:02:04,885
But why?

40
00:02:05,052 --> 00:02:07,763
- And how did I get it home?
- I really couldn't tell you.

41
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:09,598
Did I rent a truck?

42
00:02:10,557 --> 00:02:11,600
Who knows?

43
00:02:11,976 --> 00:02:14,770
I'm telling you,
we got a real mystery on our hands.

44
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:17,231
Yeah, it's a puzzler.

45
00:02:17,398 --> 00:02:19,566
Now, I'm gonna go up
and adjust the dish...

46
00:02:19,733 --> 00:02:23,112
and you go look at the TV
and tell me when the picture improves.

47
00:02:23,278 --> 00:02:24,488
All right.

48
00:02:24,655 --> 00:02:26,448
I still think we should call the guy.

49
00:02:26,615 --> 00:02:28,450
Will you forget the guy?

50
00:02:28,617 --> 00:02:29,910
I'm the guy.

51
00:02:35,624 --> 00:02:37,668
- Charlie.
- Yeah?

52
00:02:37,835 --> 00:02:39,670
There's a pair of panties up here.

53
00:02:41,672 --> 00:02:44,591
Of course, the ladder.

54
00:02:45,008 --> 00:02:48,470
- Alan, mystery solved.
- What?

55
00:02:48,929 --> 00:02:52,099
Never mind. Focus on the job at hand.

56
00:02:52,266 --> 00:02:54,435
- Are you watching the TV?
- Y es.

57
00:02:54,601 --> 00:02:55,644
How does it look now?

58
00:02:56,019 --> 00:02:57,354
It's a little better.

59
00:02:57,521 --> 00:02:58,605
How about now?

60
00:02:58,731 --> 00:03:00,190
No, no, no. That's worse.

61
00:03:00,315 --> 00:03:02,276
- Move it the other way.
- What?

62
00:03:02,443 --> 00:03:04,445
I said, move it the other way.

63
00:03:04,611 --> 00:03:07,322
- There, there, there. That's perfect.
- What?

64
00:03:07,489 --> 00:03:09,283
I said that's perfect.

65
00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:12,369
Great. Coming down.

66
00:03:16,373 --> 00:03:18,333
Did you say something?

67
00:03:43,216 --> 00:03:45,760
I told you.
We should have called the guy.

68
00:03:49,972 --> 00:03:54,060
Oh, you wanna flip me the bird,
but the poor little fellow can't fly.

69
00:03:55,895 --> 00:03:57,355
Just help me lie down.

70
00:03:57,814 --> 00:04:00,316
- There is a bright side here, you know.
- Oh, really?

71
00:04:00,441 --> 00:04:04,654
Really? And what might the
bright side be? Handicapped parking?

72
00:04:09,367 --> 00:04:11,411
Pity sex?

73
00:04:12,995 --> 00:04:16,165
You know, I can see there's gonna be
no talking to you about this.

74
00:04:16,332 --> 00:04:19,669
Oh, do me a favor and call Judith
and tell her not to bring Jake over.

75
00:04:19,794 --> 00:04:21,379
How come?

76
00:04:21,712 --> 00:04:22,839
Look at me, Charlie.

77
00:04:23,005 --> 00:04:26,300
I have abrasions, contusions,
a severely sprained neck...

78
00:04:26,425 --> 00:04:29,595
two fractured fingers,
and I'm hopped up on pain pills.

79
00:04:29,762 --> 00:04:32,098
Does that spell weekend dad to you?

80
00:04:32,265 --> 00:04:33,516
Actually, to me it spells:

81
00:04:33,683 --> 00:04:36,227
"Weekend in Bangkok
with two Olympic gymnasts. "

82
00:04:38,855 --> 00:04:41,107
But that's a whole other story.

83
00:04:42,024 --> 00:04:45,319
Look, I got no plans for the weekend.
I could take care of Jake.

84
00:04:45,486 --> 00:04:48,990
- Bangkok?
- lt was the '80s.

85
00:04:49,157 --> 00:04:50,449
A simpler time.

86
00:04:51,951 --> 00:04:53,077
The dollar was strong.

87
00:04:54,412 --> 00:04:57,206
I was looking forward to hanging out
with the knucklehead.

88
00:04:57,373 --> 00:04:58,875
Let him come over.

89
00:04:59,041 --> 00:05:01,502
I can't help you.
What will you do all weekend?

90
00:05:01,669 --> 00:05:03,713
I don't know.
Hey, maybe I'll get a chute.

91
00:05:04,839 --> 00:05:07,341
We could play Chutes and Ladders.

92
00:05:11,846 --> 00:05:15,641
You see. See, that's why I want Jake
here. He has a sense of humor.

93
00:05:16,851 --> 00:05:19,437
Oh, all right.
If you think you can handle it.

94
00:05:19,604 --> 00:05:21,397
Don't worry,
I got everything covered.

95
00:05:21,772 --> 00:05:23,190
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

96
00:05:23,357 --> 00:05:25,526
Is there anything I can do
for you now?

97
00:05:26,903 --> 00:05:28,070
Well, I gotta pee.

98
00:05:30,656 --> 00:05:32,158
Yeah, so?

99
00:05:32,325 --> 00:05:35,661
So I can't undo my pants...

100
00:05:36,078 --> 00:05:37,705
or anything.

101
00:05:38,497 --> 00:05:40,499
Where are we headed with this, Alan?

102
00:05:41,417 --> 00:05:42,543
You said you'd help me.

103
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:45,087
I was thinking like
I could make you a sandwich.

104
00:05:45,254 --> 00:05:47,757
- Charlie!
- Hey, I am not reaching into your pants.

105
00:05:47,882 --> 00:05:50,343
Well, what am I supposed to do?

106
00:05:51,636 --> 00:05:53,262
Go stand in the surf.

107
00:05:54,555 --> 00:05:57,433
Come on, grow up.

108
00:05:57,683 --> 00:05:59,560
- Where are you going?
- T o the bathroom.

109
00:05:59,727 --> 00:06:01,062
Now, come on and unzip me.

110
00:06:01,228 --> 00:06:04,607
Just like that? Right to it?
No dinner? No movie?

111
00:06:04,774 --> 00:06:06,442
Charlie!

112
00:06:07,193 --> 00:06:08,944
Hold on.

113
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:16,452
Coming.

114
00:06:32,176 --> 00:06:34,929
Holy God.

115
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:41,519
Charlie, can you get the door?

116
00:06:43,437 --> 00:06:44,605
Charlie?

117
00:06:46,649 --> 00:06:48,442
Hang on.

118
00:06:48,734 --> 00:06:50,778
Charlie!

119
00:06:53,823 --> 00:06:58,285
Oh, great,
I think I just punctured a lung.

120
00:07:02,623 --> 00:07:06,252
"Don't worry, Alan.
I've got everything covered. "

121
00:07:12,383 --> 00:07:13,592
I'm coming.

122
00:07:33,779 --> 00:07:36,073
You need to start your report
this weekend.

123
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,242
Why?
It's not due till next Wednesday.

124
00:07:38,450 --> 00:07:40,703
- I've plenty of time.
- You said that last time.

125
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:42,413
- No, I didn't.
- Yes, you did.

126
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:44,790
I think you're getting senile.

127
00:07:45,833 --> 00:07:47,293
Watch your mouth, young man.

128
00:07:47,459 --> 00:07:50,254
I can't watch it. It's under my nose.

129
00:07:53,007 --> 00:07:55,176
- Hello.
- What happened to you?

130
00:07:55,634 --> 00:08:00,014
Well, most recently,
I was hit in the head by a door.

131
00:08:00,514 --> 00:08:03,517
But before that, I was fixing
the satellite dish on the roof...

132
00:08:03,684 --> 00:08:05,436
and I kind of fell.

133
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:08,355
Why didn't you just call the guy?

134
00:08:11,567 --> 00:08:15,029
For God's sake, Alan, how do you intend
to look after him this weekend?

135
00:08:15,196 --> 00:08:19,867
I am in excruciating pain,
but I appreciate your concern.

136
00:08:20,409 --> 00:08:23,537
Oh, well, you could've picked up
a phone and given me a heads up.

137
00:08:23,704 --> 00:08:24,955
Pick up the phone?

138
00:08:25,122 --> 00:08:28,667
Judith, I needed barbecue tongs
to take a leak.

139
00:08:29,627 --> 00:08:31,337
Can you look after Jake or not?

140
00:08:31,503 --> 00:08:33,756
- Charlie said he'd look after him.
- Like hell.

141
00:08:33,881 --> 00:08:37,635
There's no way I'll let your degenerate
brother be responsible for my son.

142
00:08:37,801 --> 00:08:39,345
Sure, don't ask me what I want.

143
00:08:39,511 --> 00:08:43,390
Just boss me around
like you're my boss or something.

144
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:48,062
Charlie will be fine.
Have a good weekend.

145
00:08:49,939 --> 00:08:51,231
Thanks.

146
00:08:52,107 --> 00:08:53,859
You too.

147
00:08:55,611 --> 00:08:58,030
Hey, can we go out to dinner tonight?

148
00:08:58,197 --> 00:09:00,616
Do I look like I'm in any shape
to go to dinner?

149
00:09:00,783 --> 00:09:03,327
I don't know. I'm not a doctor.

150
00:09:03,744 --> 00:09:05,955
- The answer is no.
- Okay.

151
00:09:06,872 --> 00:09:10,084
Then can we go to the video store
and rent the new "Final Fantasy"?

152
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:12,962
Jake, I hurt myself.
I'm in a lot of pain.

153
00:09:13,128 --> 00:09:16,507
So? When I took a soccer ball
to the nads, I was in a lot of pain...

154
00:09:16,674 --> 00:09:19,468
and all my coach said was,
"Walk it off. "

155
00:09:20,594 --> 00:09:22,721
Well, you can't just walk this off.

156
00:09:22,888 --> 00:09:24,682
Not with that attitude.

157
00:09:26,934 --> 00:09:28,852
Hey, there he is.
How's it going, buddy?

158
00:09:29,311 --> 00:09:30,437
My life stinks.

159
00:09:30,604 --> 00:09:32,231
Cheer up, you're still a kid.

160
00:09:32,398 --> 00:09:34,733
It's gonna get much worse.

161
00:09:35,192 --> 00:09:37,111
- Where have you been?
- Taking a nap.

162
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:41,115
- Why?
- I find it refreshes me.

163
00:09:41,281 --> 00:09:43,575
You said you were gonna take care
of everything.

164
00:09:43,742 --> 00:09:44,993
Yeah, so?

165
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:47,913
So while you were sleeping,
I had to answer the door.

166
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,833
Do you realize how petty
you sound right now?

167
00:09:51,417 --> 00:09:54,503
- Relax, lie down, I got it covered.
- No, you don't.

168
00:09:54,670 --> 00:09:57,673
Nothing is covered. It's all coverless.

169
00:09:58,674 --> 00:10:01,552
Now, there is a life that stinks.

170
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,512
What's the agenda?
What do you want?

171
00:10:03,679 --> 00:10:07,307
- I wanna go out to dinner.
- Yeah, well, I want my own talk show.

172
00:10:07,474 --> 00:10:08,767
You'll eat what we've got.

173
00:10:08,934 --> 00:10:10,144
Why can't we go out?

174
00:10:11,103 --> 00:10:13,814
Alan, I can't deal with this.
Talk to your son.

175
00:10:13,981 --> 00:10:15,941
That's it? You're done covering?

176
00:10:16,108 --> 00:10:18,444
I didn't know
he was gonna be impossible.

177
00:10:18,610 --> 00:10:22,114
- Don't talk about me like I'm not here.
- Keep yapping and you won't be.

178
00:10:24,074 --> 00:10:26,410
- Charlie, just take him to dinner.
- Why should l?

179
00:10:26,618 --> 00:10:28,537
He's not gonna shut up till he gets it.

180
00:10:28,704 --> 00:10:30,622
That's true. I'll drive you crazy.

181
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:33,041
Yeah, well, do your worst.

182
00:10:34,251 --> 00:10:36,753
If we go out to dinner,
there's nothing to clean up.

183
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:38,046
We're not going out.

184
00:10:38,172 --> 00:10:40,841
- You usually wanna go out to dinner.
- Not tonight.

185
00:10:40,966 --> 00:10:44,595
You're not punishing me,
you're just punishing yourself.

186
00:10:44,928 --> 00:10:47,097
Back off, bobblehead.

187
00:10:49,349 --> 00:10:50,976
Oh, come on, it'll be fun.

188
00:10:51,143 --> 00:10:53,020
- We're not going.
- Why not?

189
00:10:53,187 --> 00:10:56,815
- This conversation's over.
- Not if I keep talking.

190
00:10:59,735 --> 00:11:01,361
So where do you wanna eat?

191
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:02,905
Clucky's.

192
00:11:03,655 --> 00:11:04,865
What's Clucky's?

193
00:11:05,032 --> 00:11:06,533
Zesty fire-roasted chicken...

194
00:11:06,658 --> 00:11:10,162
with Grandma Clucky's
secret herbs and spices.

195
00:11:10,579 --> 00:11:12,664
All right, where is it?

196
00:11:12,831 --> 00:11:15,209
There's several convenient locations.

197
00:11:15,375 --> 00:11:16,668
Like where?

198
00:11:16,877 --> 00:11:18,587
I don't know. I just sit in the car.

199
00:11:19,046 --> 00:11:20,714
I've never seen a Clucky's here.

200
00:11:20,881 --> 00:11:22,007
- How about a pizza?
- No.

201
00:11:22,174 --> 00:11:23,217
- Burgers?
- No.

202
00:11:23,383 --> 00:11:24,426
Sushi?

203
00:11:24,593 --> 00:11:26,178
- ltalian? Chinese?
- No.

204
00:11:26,345 --> 00:11:27,387
- Clucky's?
- No.

205
00:11:27,554 --> 00:11:28,805
You're not even listening.

206
00:11:28,972 --> 00:11:30,557
I mean yes.

207
00:11:30,724 --> 00:11:32,226
Clucky's.

208
00:11:32,392 --> 00:11:35,812
I'm not driving all over the city
hoping to stumble across a Clucky's.

209
00:11:37,189 --> 00:11:39,233
This isn't the Clucky's my mom
takes me to.

210
00:11:39,399 --> 00:11:40,817
No kidding.

211
00:11:40,984 --> 00:11:42,486
Where are we anyway?

212
00:11:42,861 --> 00:11:44,863
It's called Watts.

213
00:11:56,917 --> 00:11:59,461
Hurry up and finish your chicken.

214
00:11:59,628 --> 00:12:01,254
I like the Cajun Clucky's better.

215
00:12:01,421 --> 00:12:02,547
Good for you.

216
00:12:02,714 --> 00:12:05,926
- Can I go back and get Cajun Clucky's?
- No, eat what you got.

217
00:12:06,093 --> 00:12:09,680
- But I like the Cajun Clucky's.
- Why did you order the regular Clucky's?

218
00:12:09,846 --> 00:12:12,099
Because I forgot
I like the Cajun Clucky's.

219
00:12:12,599 --> 00:12:14,601
Oh, just eat the freaking chicken.

220
00:12:15,185 --> 00:12:16,728
Fine.

221
00:12:18,021 --> 00:12:20,232
Why do you say freaking?
I know what you mean.

222
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:22,693
- I'm not a little kid anymore.
- Eat.

223
00:12:22,859 --> 00:12:24,403
Don't talk. Eat!

224
00:12:36,206 --> 00:12:37,833
What's up?

225
00:12:48,426 --> 00:12:50,219
I gotta pee.

226
00:12:53,806 --> 00:12:57,226
Charlie, get the tongs.

227
00:12:58,519 --> 00:13:00,438
Charlie?

228
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:06,861
Gotta pee, gotta pee,
Gotta pee, pee, pee

229
00:13:07,027 --> 00:13:08,362
Gotta pee, pee, pee

230
00:13:08,529 --> 00:13:11,031
Gotta pee, gotta pee,
Gotta pee, pee, pee, gotta pee

231
00:13:11,282 --> 00:13:14,535
Alan, I've got somebody
who wants to meet you.

232
00:13:22,543 --> 00:13:24,503
Not a good time, Mom.

233
00:13:25,212 --> 00:13:27,173
Y es, I can see that.

234
00:13:27,339 --> 00:13:28,507
Are you all right?

235
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:31,719
No, not really.

236
00:13:32,553 --> 00:13:35,055
Oh, my poor baby.

237
00:13:37,308 --> 00:13:39,768
Well, anyway, Mona, Alan.

238
00:13:39,935 --> 00:13:41,061
Alan, Mona.

239
00:13:42,021 --> 00:13:43,606
Hi, Mona.

240
00:13:45,149 --> 00:13:47,735
Hello. What happened to you?

241
00:13:48,110 --> 00:13:51,322
I was fixing a satellite dish
and I fell off the roof.

242
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:54,033
Well, why didn't you just call the guy?

243
00:13:55,701 --> 00:13:57,912
You wanna know
why I didn't call the guy?

244
00:13:58,078 --> 00:14:00,206
I'll tell you why I didn't call the guy.

245
00:14:00,372 --> 00:14:02,291
Because you don't need
to call the guy.

246
00:14:02,458 --> 00:14:04,960
It's a simple adjustment
that any idiot can do.

247
00:14:05,127 --> 00:14:07,546
And, yes, I know,
this idiot fell off the roof...

248
00:14:07,713 --> 00:14:13,177
but it was after I fixed it
all by myself, no guy.

249
00:14:14,261 --> 00:14:17,640
Okay, the ice has been broken.
I'll just give you Mona's number...

250
00:14:17,806 --> 00:14:20,643
and you can call her some time
when it's more convenient.

251
00:14:20,809 --> 00:14:21,936
Come along, dear.

252
00:14:23,187 --> 00:14:25,272
Do you just stay awake nights...

253
00:14:25,397 --> 00:14:27,900
trying to think of new ways
to embarrass me?

254
00:14:31,654 --> 00:14:33,197
Still gotta pee.

255
00:14:33,364 --> 00:14:35,074
Oh, God.

256
00:14:37,534 --> 00:14:39,828
Oh, what the hell.

257
00:14:45,167 --> 00:14:48,879
Oh, yeah.
The Cajun Clucky's is way better.

258
00:14:50,214 --> 00:14:53,092
I'll notify Zagats.

259
00:14:53,842 --> 00:14:56,553
Before we stop at the video store,
can we get ice cream?

260
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:00,266
- Who said we're stopping?
- I wanna rent the new "Final Fantasy. "

261
00:15:00,432 --> 00:15:02,434
Y eah, well, I want my
$80,000 Mercedes...

262
00:15:02,559 --> 00:15:04,812
not to smell like chicken.

263
00:15:04,979 --> 00:15:07,147
But life is full
of little disappointments.

264
00:15:07,314 --> 00:15:10,484
Okay, forget the ice cream.
We'll just stop at the video store.

265
00:15:10,651 --> 00:15:13,112
Jake, I'm tired, I've got a headache.

266
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:17,199
I just paid $100 to get
my car back from the "chicken valet. "

267
00:15:18,367 --> 00:15:19,952
And I wanna go home.

268
00:15:20,703 --> 00:15:21,787
Please?

269
00:15:22,121 --> 00:15:24,665
I'm sorry. What part of no
did you not understand?

270
00:15:24,832 --> 00:15:26,667
The "nnn" or the "ooo"?

271
00:15:28,544 --> 00:15:30,838
How about if we stop
in front of the store...

272
00:15:31,005 --> 00:15:33,966
I'll run in, get the video game,
and you wait in the car?

273
00:15:34,133 --> 00:15:36,135
How about we stop
by the video store...

274
00:15:36,301 --> 00:15:38,595
and I just stuff you
through the return slot?

275
00:15:39,138 --> 00:15:40,305
I wouldn't fit.

276
00:15:40,472 --> 00:15:42,349
Try me.

277
00:15:42,516 --> 00:15:44,768
Oh, come on,
it will only take a minute.

278
00:15:44,935 --> 00:15:48,355
You might be able to bully your parents
into doing whatever you want...

279
00:15:48,522 --> 00:15:50,149
but when I say no, that's it.

280
00:15:50,315 --> 00:15:53,485
Okay. Then I guess I won't have
a video game to play this weekend.

281
00:15:53,610 --> 00:15:55,863
Exactly.
You'll find something else to do.

282
00:15:56,030 --> 00:15:58,157
Right. It will just be you and me.

283
00:16:03,579 --> 00:16:06,415
- They're all out of "Final Fantasy. "
- So get something else.

284
00:16:06,582 --> 00:16:08,542
But I want "Final Fantasy. "

285
00:16:08,709 --> 00:16:10,794
Are you telling me that out
of this store...

286
00:16:10,961 --> 00:16:15,007
thousands of movies and video games,
there's nothing here that interests you?

287
00:16:15,174 --> 00:16:17,134
You're not gonna like the answer.

288
00:16:18,886 --> 00:16:20,679
I'm having chest pains.

289
00:16:22,556 --> 00:16:25,017
You're giving me chest pains.

290
00:16:25,726 --> 00:16:28,312
I bet they have "Final Fantasy"
at another store.

291
00:16:28,687 --> 00:16:29,938
You want a final fantasy?

292
00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:33,901
Close your eyes and imagine yourself
flying across a freaking video store...

293
00:16:34,067 --> 00:16:36,111
because that's what's about
to happen.

294
00:16:36,278 --> 00:16:37,696
Again with the freaking.

295
00:16:39,656 --> 00:16:43,035
Excuse me, but did I hear you say
you were looking for "Final Fantasy"?

296
00:16:43,619 --> 00:16:45,662
I was about to return one,
you can have it.

297
00:16:45,829 --> 00:16:47,372
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

298
00:16:47,915 --> 00:16:52,085
- Oh, he's really something, isn't he?
- Oh, yeah, he's something.

299
00:16:52,294 --> 00:16:54,838
The question is, what?

300
00:16:55,631 --> 00:16:57,132
I have a boy his age.

301
00:16:57,299 --> 00:16:59,009
- Single mom.
- Single uncle.

302
00:16:59,927 --> 00:17:01,053
- Betsy.
- Charlie.

303
00:17:01,178 --> 00:17:03,347
- Jake.
- Nobody asked you.

304
00:17:04,348 --> 00:17:06,475
Betsy, maybe we can get
the boys together...

305
00:17:06,642 --> 00:17:08,352
for a little play date some time.

306
00:17:08,519 --> 00:17:10,938
I don't want a play date
with some stupid kid...

307
00:17:11,104 --> 00:17:12,940
just so you can have sex with her.

308
00:17:19,488 --> 00:17:20,781
Isn't he something?

309
00:17:21,365 --> 00:17:24,076
Yeah. Well, it was nice meeting you.

310
00:17:26,286 --> 00:17:27,788
Bye-bye.

311
00:17:30,874 --> 00:17:31,959
What?

312
00:17:32,125 --> 00:17:33,377
Are you happy?

313
00:17:36,755 --> 00:17:38,257
Pretty much. You?

314
00:18:06,368 --> 00:18:08,620
Hello.

315
00:18:14,543 --> 00:18:16,670
"Controlled substance.

316
00:18:16,837 --> 00:18:21,383
Do not exceed one pill
every six hours. "

317
00:18:21,550 --> 00:18:23,385
Yeah, right.

318
00:18:29,057 --> 00:18:32,894
What fresh childproof hell is this?

319
00:18:35,439 --> 00:18:37,858
Come on, you bastard.

320
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:44,906
Yes.

321
00:18:53,749 --> 00:18:57,252
- What are we doing?
- I'm taking you back to your mother.

322
00:18:58,336 --> 00:18:59,463
Why?

323
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:02,382
Why? I'll tell you why.

324
00:19:02,549 --> 00:19:05,093
Because you're no fun anymore.

325
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:07,721
Because the whole
"isn't he cute" thing is over.

326
00:19:07,929 --> 00:19:11,183
I tell you, if this is a prelude
to what you'll be as a teenager...

327
00:19:11,349 --> 00:19:13,310
then we've got a serious problem.

328
00:19:13,810 --> 00:19:15,020
Whatever.

329
00:19:15,645 --> 00:19:19,107
You see, right there,
that attitude does not fly with me.

330
00:19:19,274 --> 00:19:20,942
Whatever.

331
00:19:26,990 --> 00:19:28,992
God, I hope that's the chicken.

332
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:35,165
She's not home.

333
00:19:37,167 --> 00:19:38,835
Do not "ha-ha" me.

334
00:19:39,002 --> 00:19:40,712
Never "ha-ha" me.

335
00:19:41,588 --> 00:19:44,591
Judith, come get your kid.

336
00:19:46,092 --> 00:19:48,136
Don't hide behind the couch.

337
00:19:48,303 --> 00:19:50,722
I can see you, Judith.

338
00:20:08,365 --> 00:20:10,408
Hey, how about some ice cream?

339
00:20:12,202 --> 00:20:13,411
Sure.

340
00:20:14,329 --> 00:20:16,790
Listen, I'm sorry I lost my temper.

341
00:20:16,957 --> 00:20:20,001
Sorry you slipped in dog crap
chasing me.

342
00:20:21,503 --> 00:20:23,088
Thank you.

343
00:20:24,130 --> 00:20:25,966
Now, you know that I love you...

344
00:20:26,132 --> 00:20:29,386
but we gotta be clear
on a couple of things.

345
00:20:29,553 --> 00:20:32,055
I get that you're growing up,
your body's changing...

346
00:20:32,222 --> 00:20:33,598
your emotions are in flux.

347
00:20:33,723 --> 00:20:39,229
But the important thing you need to keep
in mind is that I don't care.

348
00:20:41,398 --> 00:20:43,858
When you're in my house,
when you're out with me...

349
00:20:44,025 --> 00:20:46,111
and especially
when we're around women...

350
00:20:46,278 --> 00:20:48,947
you will be adorable, got it?

351
00:20:49,823 --> 00:20:51,241
I'm trying to concentrate.

352
00:20:51,783 --> 00:20:54,619
Don't shush me. Never shush me.

353
00:20:55,036 --> 00:20:56,079
Whatever.

354
00:21:03,211 --> 00:21:04,254
Please be the chicken.

355
00:21:10,343 --> 00:21:12,804
Pour me one of those, will you?

356
00:21:14,597 --> 00:21:18,310
You know, mixing those pills
with alcohol is a really bad idea.

357
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:22,981
Not if you're trying to die.

358
00:21:29,321 --> 00:21:32,073
Hey, how many of those pills
you got left?

359
00:21:56,139 --> 00:21:58,224
