1
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:09,738
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven—

2
00:00:09,905 --> 00:00:13,033
- What are you doing?
- Masticating.

3
00:00:14,284 --> 00:00:15,953
- What?
- Don't worry.

4
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:19,248
- lt doesn't mean what you think.
- What do you think I think?

5
00:00:19,415 --> 00:00:21,375
You know.

6
00:00:22,167 --> 00:00:24,753
Okay, I know what I know.

7
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:26,255
What do you know?

8
00:00:26,422 --> 00:00:30,217
I know you're supposed to masticate
your food 20 times before you swallow.

9
00:00:30,384 --> 00:00:32,720
Yeah, but what about the other thing?

10
00:00:32,886 --> 00:00:35,013
What other thing?

11
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:37,516
The thing you thought I was thinking.

12
00:00:38,058 --> 00:00:40,144
I'm sorry, Dad. You lost me.

13
00:00:42,563 --> 00:00:45,441
- Morning.
- Oh, morning. Isn't this your day off?

14
00:00:45,607 --> 00:00:48,569
- lt is. But I need to talk to Charlie.
- Well, good luck.

15
00:00:48,736 --> 00:00:51,822
He got home, had a bowl of chili,
threw up and went to bed.

16
00:00:51,989 --> 00:00:55,242
He probably threw up
because he didn't masticate enough.

17
00:00:57,411 --> 00:01:00,164
Hey, potty-mouth,
there's a lady present.

18
00:01:00,330 --> 00:01:02,124
Why don't you tell me
what you need...

19
00:01:02,291 --> 00:01:06,628
then you can go enjoy your day off by
spreading sunshine and cheer to others.

20
00:01:06,795 --> 00:01:09,173
It's about the house.
I should wait for Charlie.

21
00:01:09,339 --> 00:01:11,592
I live here too. What's the problem?

22
00:01:12,718 --> 00:01:13,802
I'll wait.

23
00:01:13,969 --> 00:01:17,222
Oh, for God's sakes, pretend I'm Charlie.
Talk to me.

24
00:01:17,848 --> 00:01:19,600
Okay.

25
00:01:20,350 --> 00:01:21,810
Charlie, I thought it over.

26
00:01:21,977 --> 00:01:25,105
If you want me to kill your brother,
I'll need the cash up front.

27
00:01:28,775 --> 00:01:32,237
- Very amusing.
- Thanks, I've been taking an improv class.

28
00:01:32,404 --> 00:01:34,364
Okay, here's the deal.

29
00:01:34,531 --> 00:01:36,825
I got five brothers and sisters.

30
00:01:36,992 --> 00:01:41,288
I'm the middle child, which probably
explains why I'm such a people pleaser.

31
00:01:43,415 --> 00:01:46,084
Anyhow, my brother Philip,
he's the second oldest.

32
00:01:46,251 --> 00:01:50,797
He's in the roadside fireworks business,
which is, as you might expect, seasonal.

33
00:01:52,341 --> 00:01:56,511
This creates some economic uncertainty,
which has strained his marriage.

34
00:01:56,678 --> 00:02:00,515
Perhaps not as much as him boinking
his wife's half-sister.

35
00:02:00,682 --> 00:02:02,809
But it's a snowball effect.

36
00:02:02,976 --> 00:02:05,229
Anyway, to make a long story short.

37
00:02:05,395 --> 00:02:06,897
T oo late.

38
00:02:07,648 --> 00:02:11,151
Fair enough. Berta one, Zippy one.

39
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:16,657
Anyway, Philip can't live at his house
because technically it's a crime scene.

40
00:02:18,367 --> 00:02:22,329
- Which is why I wanted to ask Charlie—
- You want your brother to stay here?

41
00:02:22,496 --> 00:02:23,956
Oh, don't be stupid.

42
00:02:24,122 --> 00:02:25,457
He's staying at my place...

43
00:02:25,624 --> 00:02:29,002
trying to wean himself off the meth
and the codeine and whatnot.

44
00:02:29,169 --> 00:02:32,089
I wanna stay here for a couple of days.

45
00:02:34,466 --> 00:02:38,845
- That's okay. I'll ask Charlie.
- No, you don't have to ask Charlie.

46
00:02:39,012 --> 00:02:40,639
You can ask me.

47
00:02:40,806 --> 00:02:42,557
Fine.

48
00:02:44,351 --> 00:02:46,019
Oh, you'd like an answer now.

49
00:02:46,186 --> 00:02:48,105
That'd be swell.

50
00:02:48,271 --> 00:02:52,067
Well, I would have to say...

51
00:02:52,234 --> 00:02:54,569
after due consideration...

52
00:02:54,736 --> 00:03:00,242
and taking into account all the factors
that are involved...

53
00:03:00,409 --> 00:03:05,789
that it would be our pleasure
to have you.

54
00:03:05,956 --> 00:03:08,041
Super. Do you mind if I take your room?

55
00:03:08,834 --> 00:03:11,420
- My room? Gee, l—
- Trust me.

56
00:03:11,586 --> 00:03:14,548
You want me to have a room
with a private crapper.

57
00:03:18,051 --> 00:03:19,511
Okay. By all means.

58
00:03:20,012 --> 00:03:23,015
- Take my room. I'll bunk with Jake.
- Thanks.

59
00:03:23,181 --> 00:03:25,016
What do you mean
you'll bunk with Jake?

60
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:28,311
- ls that a problem?
- Yes, I need my privacy.

61
00:03:28,478 --> 00:03:31,440
- For what?
- You know.

62
00:03:53,902 --> 00:03:56,530
Never again.

63
00:03:58,031 --> 00:04:01,243
Never, ever, ever again.

64
00:04:01,743 --> 00:04:03,078
You gonna quit drinking?

65
00:04:03,245 --> 00:04:05,539
Don't be ridiculous.

66
00:04:06,373 --> 00:04:08,625
I'm gonna quit waking up.

67
00:04:10,502 --> 00:04:12,462
What are you doing?
Is this your day off?

68
00:04:12,629 --> 00:04:16,800
It is, but your brother invited me to be
your houseguest for a couple of days.

69
00:04:20,512 --> 00:04:21,555
Did he, now?

70
00:04:21,722 --> 00:04:25,058
I was gonna ask you, but Alan said
he could speak for both of you.

71
00:04:26,018 --> 00:04:27,686
Did he, now?

72
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:31,189
- You got a problem with that?
- Don't be silly. You're like family.

73
00:04:31,356 --> 00:04:34,443
Yeah, well,
I've seen how you treat family.

74
00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:38,113
Hey, you're always welcome here.
You don't even have to ask.

75
00:04:40,157 --> 00:04:43,285
- Morning, Alan.
- Hey, look, who finally—

76
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:47,748
Berta? Living here? Are you insane?

77
00:04:47,915 --> 00:04:50,584
She needed a place to stay.
What would you have said?

78
00:04:50,751 --> 00:04:54,129
I would have explained my sincere belief
that there are boundaries...

79
00:04:54,296 --> 00:04:56,340
between employer and employee...

80
00:04:56,506 --> 00:04:59,593
which exist specifically
to protect said employer...

81
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:01,803
from accidentally seeing
the employee...

82
00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:05,015
prancing around
in her big cotton granny-panties.

83
00:05:05,807 --> 00:05:07,726
All right. Go tell her that.

84
00:05:09,061 --> 00:05:10,187
Okay, I was bluffing.

85
00:05:11,772 --> 00:05:14,858
Look, look, it's just for a couple of days.
We can tough it out.

86
00:05:15,025 --> 00:05:16,401
But we wouldn't have to...

87
00:05:16,568 --> 00:05:20,197
if you hadn't presumed to invite
someone to stay without my permission.

88
00:05:20,364 --> 00:05:21,823
Hey, hey, I live here too.

89
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:23,492
So do termites.

90
00:05:24,868 --> 00:05:27,871
But they don't have
guest-inviting privileges either.

91
00:05:28,038 --> 00:05:31,958
- You're equating me with termites?
- Hell, no. You can get rid of termites.

92
00:05:34,419 --> 00:05:37,464
You know, if I thought you meant that,
I would be really hurt.

93
00:05:37,631 --> 00:05:40,967
Too subtle?
Okay, let me take another tack.

94
00:05:41,134 --> 00:05:44,221
Do you know why I've never
accepted money from you to stay here?

95
00:05:44,388 --> 00:05:46,973
I assumed you were being
compassionate and generous...

96
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:49,434
during a difficult period in my life.

97
00:05:52,229 --> 00:05:55,565
It's so you can be here and Jake
can be here, but it remains my house.

98
00:05:55,732 --> 00:05:57,609
- Not our house.
- What's the difference?

99
00:05:57,776 --> 00:06:03,240
In my house, what you think, what you
want, what you say, doesn't mean squat.

100
00:06:04,616 --> 00:06:07,577
It's just jibber-jabber.

101
00:06:07,744 --> 00:06:10,122
So you're saying I have no rights here?

102
00:06:10,288 --> 00:06:12,124
I thought that was understood.

103
00:06:13,166 --> 00:06:15,043
I can't believe we're talking about it.

104
00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:18,505
I've been living here two years.
You still consider me a houseguest.

105
00:06:18,672 --> 00:06:22,217
No, my houseguests bring a bottle
of wine and have sex with me.

106
00:06:24,344 --> 00:06:28,098
Oh, I'm sorry. I'll go get some
chardonnay and assume the position.

107
00:06:30,851 --> 00:06:35,021
Hey, don't be letting your mouth
write checks your ass can't cash.

108
00:06:40,277 --> 00:06:42,279
Pompous jerk.

109
00:06:42,446 --> 00:06:44,281
I don't know how you put up with that.

110
00:06:45,699 --> 00:06:48,243
You heard? We were whispering.

111
00:06:48,410 --> 00:06:51,496
Must be one of them
acoustical anomalies.

112
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,416
I just think it's criminal,
the way Charlie treats you.

113
00:06:54,583 --> 00:06:56,334
Like some kind of second-class citizen.

114
00:06:56,835 --> 00:06:58,336
Second class?

115
00:06:58,503 --> 00:07:00,338
I aspire to second class.

116
00:07:00,881 --> 00:07:02,883
You know the pecking order
in this house?

117
00:07:03,049 --> 00:07:05,802
Charlie. Women Charlie sleeps with.
Charlie's bookie.

118
00:07:05,969 --> 00:07:10,640
Women Charlie hopes to sleep with.
Termites. Me.

119
00:07:11,683 --> 00:07:13,185
Well, that's just not right.

120
00:07:13,351 --> 00:07:16,813
What am I supposed to do?
I can't really afford my own place.

121
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:19,691
I could, but it certainly
wouldn't be on the beach.

122
00:07:19,858 --> 00:07:22,861
Unless the beach was Guadalcanal.

123
00:07:23,028 --> 00:07:27,199
It's a shame. You paying all that money
for an ex-wife and an ex-wife's house...

124
00:07:27,365 --> 00:07:29,534
and you're not
allowed inside either one.

125
00:07:29,701 --> 00:07:31,703
Exactly.

126
00:07:35,832 --> 00:07:36,958
I'm a victim here.

127
00:07:37,125 --> 00:07:39,044
Yeah. You got victim
written all over you.

128
00:07:40,587 --> 00:07:42,088
Does my brother sympathize?

129
00:07:42,255 --> 00:07:44,382
Do Catholic priests
make good babysitters?

130
00:07:47,886 --> 00:07:51,514
Listen. You want rights and privileges,
you gotta demand them.

131
00:07:51,681 --> 00:07:53,558
Stand up to Charlie. Get in his face.

132
00:07:54,184 --> 00:07:55,936
You know what? You're right.

133
00:07:56,102 --> 00:07:59,397
- And starting now.
- Go get him, tiger.

134
00:08:00,649 --> 00:08:03,985
Come here, Charlie. I wanna—

135
00:08:13,027 --> 00:08:15,780
Oh, that is so wrong.

136
00:08:18,992 --> 00:08:20,743
- Hey.
- Hey.

137
00:08:20,910 --> 00:08:23,830
You know, Charlie,
you've really got a beautiful view here.

138
00:08:23,997 --> 00:08:25,456
You're just noticing that?

139
00:08:25,623 --> 00:08:28,251
Well, I spend most of my days
looking at dirty toilets...

140
00:08:28,418 --> 00:08:30,920
and those Rorschach tests
you call bed sheets.

141
00:08:32,463 --> 00:08:35,133
It's nice you get a chance
to stop and smell the roses.

142
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:38,136
Oh, don't get me started
on the smells around here.

143
00:08:38,303 --> 00:08:41,973
Hey, listen, Berta,
you know how I feel about you, right?

144
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:43,766
No, tell me.

145
00:08:44,684 --> 00:08:47,145
Oh, gee, I could never put it into words.

146
00:08:47,312 --> 00:08:48,938
Well...

147
00:08:49,105 --> 00:08:51,065
then show me.

148
00:08:53,401 --> 00:08:55,445
Relax, I'm just screwing with you.

149
00:08:57,614 --> 00:08:59,032
Good one.

150
00:09:00,199 --> 00:09:01,242
Anyway.

151
00:09:02,994 --> 00:09:07,373
I believe there are certain boundaries
between an employer and an employee.

152
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:10,251
I think it'd be best if you found—

153
00:09:10,418 --> 00:09:13,379
Oh, I agree with you
about the boundaries.

154
00:09:13,546 --> 00:09:17,675
I've been keeping quiet about the things
your brother says behind your back.

155
00:09:17,842 --> 00:09:20,428
- What does he say?
- I don't wanna cause problems.

156
00:09:20,595 --> 00:09:22,639
No, no, no, come on, tell me.

157
00:09:23,389 --> 00:09:27,101
Let's just say that he doesn't always
appreciate everything you do for him.

158
00:09:27,935 --> 00:09:29,520
You know what the problem is?

159
00:09:29,687 --> 00:09:31,981
- I'm a soft touch.
- You do have a big heart.

160
00:09:32,148 --> 00:09:36,235
And there are always people out there
who will take advantage of that.

161
00:09:36,653 --> 00:09:40,198
- You wouldn't think it'd be your brother.
- Yeah, that's the saddest part.

162
00:09:41,824 --> 00:09:43,534
But what can I do about it?

163
00:09:43,701 --> 00:09:46,412
Respect's not freely given in this life,
Charlie.

164
00:09:46,579 --> 00:09:48,081
You gotta demand it.

165
00:09:48,581 --> 00:09:52,001
- It's time for me to stand up for myself.
- Good for you.

166
00:09:53,795 --> 00:09:54,921
And while you're up...

167
00:09:55,713 --> 00:09:59,092
would you get me one of those
Japanese beers in the refrigerator?

168
00:09:59,258 --> 00:10:02,220
- Oh, sure. Be right back.
- Thanks.

169
00:10:03,846 --> 00:10:07,433
I'm a bad pussycat.

170
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,899
Did you know
your body doesn't digest corn?

171
00:10:15,066 --> 00:10:17,693
It goes out the same way it comes in.

172
00:10:19,237 --> 00:10:21,906
It's like a little bookmark in your poop.

173
00:10:24,575 --> 00:10:26,494
Did they teach you that at school?

174
00:10:26,661 --> 00:10:29,497
Nope. It's the powers of observation.

175
00:10:29,664 --> 00:10:31,749
Jake, that's not dinner conversation.

176
00:10:31,916 --> 00:10:34,043
You're right. It's dinner corn-versation.

177
00:10:34,794 --> 00:10:37,380
See what happens
when you don't hit your kids?

178
00:10:38,005 --> 00:10:40,883
- Hey, something smells good.
- Meatloaf.

179
00:10:41,050 --> 00:10:43,719
- Great, I love meatloaf.
- Well, you should make some.

180
00:10:43,886 --> 00:10:45,721
I'll give you the recipe.

181
00:10:46,347 --> 00:10:47,807
You didn't make enough for me?

182
00:10:50,768 --> 00:10:51,811
I'm not your chef.

183
00:10:55,940 --> 00:10:57,942
Is that so?

184
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:03,114
How did you cook the meatloaf?

185
00:11:03,281 --> 00:11:04,448
In the oven.

186
00:11:04,991 --> 00:11:06,117
My oven.

187
00:11:06,284 --> 00:11:08,161
- What's your point?
- My point?

188
00:11:11,789 --> 00:11:14,167
Oh, don't put me in the middle.
I love you both.

189
00:11:16,961 --> 00:11:19,589
My point is, I'm hungry
and I want meatloaf.

190
00:11:19,755 --> 00:11:22,049
Yeah, well,
I'm Alan and I want respect.

191
00:11:22,216 --> 00:11:24,635
I think I got a better chance
at getting meatloaf.

192
00:11:24,802 --> 00:11:28,556
I'm starting to feel like maybe Jake
and I have overstayed our welcome.

193
00:11:28,723 --> 00:11:31,934
Not at all. Jake's still welcome.
You're the one with the attitude.

194
00:11:32,101 --> 00:11:35,104
My attitude? I thought my attitude
didn't count for anything.

195
00:11:35,271 --> 00:11:37,398
That it was just jabberwocky.

196
00:11:37,565 --> 00:11:39,859
Jibber-jabber, you moron.

197
00:11:40,026 --> 00:11:42,695
Okay, okay, that settles it.
I think it's time we moved.

198
00:11:42,862 --> 00:11:44,697
- We?
- Yeah, we.

199
00:11:44,864 --> 00:11:46,824
But I'm still welcome.

200
00:11:47,408 --> 00:11:50,286
- You'll go where I go.
- Can we get a place on the beach?

201
00:11:50,453 --> 00:11:53,247
Sure, if you don't mind
living under a lifeguard stand.

202
00:11:53,414 --> 00:11:57,209
We managed to get by without your help
before we came here, we'll do it again.

203
00:11:57,376 --> 00:11:59,962
Why do you keep saying "we"?

204
00:12:01,923 --> 00:12:04,967
Your problem is you don't appreciate
the things I do for you.

205
00:12:05,134 --> 00:12:07,511
I'm tired of being treated
as a second-class citizen.

206
00:12:07,678 --> 00:12:09,221
Fine. You wanna leave, leave.

207
00:12:11,807 --> 00:12:13,726
Maybe I will.

208
00:12:14,810 --> 00:12:17,480
- Way to stand up for yourself.
- Thank you.

209
00:12:18,397 --> 00:12:22,526
So are we really out of meatloaf or were
you just saying that to piss him off?

210
00:12:25,196 --> 00:12:26,614
Oh, this looks interesting.

211
00:12:26,781 --> 00:12:29,575
"Two-bedroom, needs work,
up-and-coming neighborhood. "

212
00:12:29,742 --> 00:12:32,036
What does that mean,
up-and-coming neighborhood?

213
00:12:32,203 --> 00:12:36,540
The realtor didn't think he could move
the house saying drug-ravaged battlefield.

214
00:12:37,416 --> 00:12:40,002
- Okay, we'll keep looking.
- Alan, I don't mean to pry.

215
00:12:40,169 --> 00:12:41,796
But after alimony and child support...

216
00:12:41,963 --> 00:12:45,716
exactly how much
can you afford to spend?

217
00:12:56,936 --> 00:12:58,145
Really?

218
00:12:58,312 --> 00:13:00,981
- Y es, really.
- Sweetie, my shoes cost more than this.

219
00:13:01,148 --> 00:13:02,900
Well, Mom, you have a lot of shoes.

220
00:13:03,067 --> 00:13:05,403
The ones I'm wearing.

221
00:13:05,569 --> 00:13:07,905
Based on this amount,
you don't need a realtor.

222
00:13:08,072 --> 00:13:10,741
You need someone
who sells camping equipment.

223
00:13:10,908 --> 00:13:12,952
Yeah, well, that's what I'll do.

224
00:13:13,494 --> 00:13:17,206
All right. But may I propose
a simple alternative?

225
00:13:17,373 --> 00:13:19,458
I'm not living with you, Mom.

226
00:13:19,625 --> 00:13:21,293
Okay.

227
00:13:22,086 --> 00:13:24,880
- Then I have a final alternative.
- And what would that be?

228
00:13:25,047 --> 00:13:27,925
Run straight to your brother's ass
and kiss it repeatedly.

229
00:13:29,176 --> 00:13:32,221
Forget it. I can't stay here anymore.

230
00:13:32,805 --> 00:13:35,641
Hey, Red. You wanna top this off
for me?

231
00:13:35,933 --> 00:13:40,146
Certainly. May I get you a short stack
and some pork links while I'm at it?

232
00:13:40,563 --> 00:13:42,106
No, I'm full.

233
00:13:42,273 --> 00:13:46,193
But as long as we're discussing
dining choices, why don't you bite me?

234
00:13:48,362 --> 00:13:50,823
Oh, goodie. More loved ones.

235
00:13:51,824 --> 00:13:53,784
- Good morning, Charlie.
- Let me guess.

236
00:13:53,951 --> 00:13:55,453
Alan invited you to move in.

237
00:13:55,953 --> 00:13:57,621
No. She's helping me move out.

238
00:13:59,123 --> 00:14:00,374
This is a sad day.

239
00:14:00,541 --> 00:14:03,085
- We're gonna miss you around here, Alan.
- Thank you.

240
00:14:03,252 --> 00:14:05,546
Sad, sad, sad.

241
00:14:05,713 --> 00:14:08,632
Don't you have anything to say, Charlie?

242
00:14:09,467 --> 00:14:10,885
Yeah.

243
00:14:16,223 --> 00:14:19,643
Okay, well, enough of sentiment.

244
00:14:19,810 --> 00:14:21,145
We should really get going.

245
00:14:21,312 --> 00:14:24,190
Apartments in your price range
are a long drive from Malibu.

246
00:14:24,356 --> 00:14:27,026
- I know, Mom.
- A long, long drive.

247
00:14:27,193 --> 00:14:28,903
Got it.

248
00:14:29,236 --> 00:14:30,905
Maybe you should go pee-pee
before—

249
00:14:31,071 --> 00:14:32,823
Okay.

250
00:14:34,617 --> 00:14:36,118
You mind looking after Jake?

251
00:14:36,327 --> 00:14:39,163
If it'll help get you out of here,
I'll breast-feed him.

252
00:14:43,709 --> 00:14:45,836
You know, with Zippy out of here...

253
00:14:46,003 --> 00:14:49,298
you're gonna have that nice
guest room just go to waste.

254
00:14:49,465 --> 00:14:50,799
- Yeah.
- So I was thinking.

255
00:14:50,966 --> 00:14:52,593
How about if I become a live-in?

256
00:14:54,053 --> 00:14:55,846
A live-in what?

257
00:14:56,013 --> 00:15:00,517
Housekeeper. Easier for you,
easier for me. Everybody wins.

258
00:15:00,684 --> 00:15:02,019
Gee—

259
00:15:02,186 --> 00:15:05,147
Hold that thought.
My coffee just kicked in.

260
00:15:12,029 --> 00:15:14,531
You wanna go down to the arcade
and play air hockey?

261
00:15:14,698 --> 00:15:15,783
No.

262
00:15:15,950 --> 00:15:18,202
- Wanna go to a movie?
- No.

263
00:15:18,369 --> 00:15:21,872
Come on, I'll take you to something
R-rated. See some boobs.

264
00:15:22,706 --> 00:15:24,249
Just leave me alone.

265
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:27,878
- Are you mad at me?
- What was your first clue?

266
00:15:28,045 --> 00:15:31,256
Well, frankly, your dismissive attitude
toward boobs.

267
00:15:33,550 --> 00:15:35,302
Why are you making us move?

268
00:15:36,095 --> 00:15:37,888
You're not moving.

269
00:15:38,055 --> 00:15:41,058
Well, then why is Dad looking
for another place for us to live?

270
00:15:41,642 --> 00:15:43,894
Because he's trying
to teach me a lesson.

271
00:15:44,061 --> 00:15:46,105
Why don't you tell him to stop?

272
00:15:46,271 --> 00:15:48,357
Because I'm trying to
teach him a lesson.

273
00:15:48,983 --> 00:15:50,317
What's your lesson?

274
00:15:51,652 --> 00:15:53,696
That it's my house.

275
00:15:54,154 --> 00:15:55,364
What's his lesson?

276
00:15:56,490 --> 00:15:58,033
That he lives here too.

277
00:15:58,993 --> 00:16:02,871
Okay, I'm just a kid,
but that sounds stupid even to me.

278
00:16:05,082 --> 00:16:08,168
Well, be that as it may,
I give you my word...

279
00:16:08,335 --> 00:16:10,421
I'm not gonna let you go anywhere.

280
00:16:10,587 --> 00:16:12,756
- Promise?
- Promise.

281
00:16:17,428 --> 00:16:18,846
Is the boob offer still open?

282
00:16:19,972 --> 00:16:21,765
Come on.

283
00:16:26,628 --> 00:16:30,674
- How do you pronounce her last name?
- Hayek. Salma Hayek.

284
00:16:30,841 --> 00:16:33,593
Her name's as pretty as her boobs.

285
00:16:36,555 --> 00:16:39,516
- Hey.
- Hey.

286
00:16:40,350 --> 00:16:41,685
What's all this?

287
00:16:41,852 --> 00:16:44,813
Found a place.
Fully furnished, ready to move in.

288
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:48,900
Jake, I packed most of your stuff. You
may wanna check if I missed anything.

289
00:16:49,067 --> 00:16:51,945
- Uncle Charlie?
- Listen to your father.

290
00:16:52,112 --> 00:16:55,031
- But you said—
- I said, listen to your father.

291
00:16:57,075 --> 00:16:58,118
I'm just a pawn.

292
00:17:01,746 --> 00:17:03,623
- So where is this place?
- ln the Valley.

293
00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:09,170
A lovely Spanish-style complex
called Valley Hacienda.

294
00:17:09,337 --> 00:17:11,214
- Good for you.
- Two-bedroom.

295
00:17:11,381 --> 00:17:13,592
Pool, Jacuzzi, rec room.

296
00:17:13,758 --> 00:17:16,928
- Sounds great.
- lt is. And we're going.

297
00:17:18,263 --> 00:17:20,390
I can see that.

298
00:17:20,557 --> 00:17:24,019
Well, it's for the best. I'll finally
have a place that's really mine...

299
00:17:24,185 --> 00:17:26,813
and you can go back to living
the selfish, unexamined life...

300
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:29,149
you obviously cherish.

301
00:17:29,316 --> 00:17:31,109
Looking forward to it.

302
00:17:32,319 --> 00:17:33,820
Okay, I guess I'm ready to go.

303
00:17:37,616 --> 00:17:40,702
Well, then, I guess we should go.

304
00:17:42,913 --> 00:17:44,080
Need some help?

305
00:17:44,873 --> 00:17:45,916
No, we can handle it.

306
00:17:51,463 --> 00:17:53,923
All right. Valley Hacienda,
here we come.

307
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:57,886
Jake, say goodbye
to your Uncle Charlie.

308
00:17:58,637 --> 00:18:01,348
- Bye, Uncle Charlie.
- Bye, kid.

309
00:18:02,098 --> 00:18:04,184
Jake, go get in the car.

310
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:06,811
Listen to your father.

311
00:18:08,396 --> 00:18:11,816
I don't think anybody's
learning anything here.

312
00:18:12,609 --> 00:18:15,320
Well, thanks for your hospitality.

313
00:18:19,115 --> 00:18:21,576
I'm sorry we overstayed our welcome.

314
00:18:27,290 --> 00:18:28,833
- Alan.
- I don't wanna go.

315
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,543
Please don't make me go.

316
00:18:31,336 --> 00:18:34,547
I love it here. I love it so much.

317
00:18:35,048 --> 00:18:39,094
- I thought you found a nice place.
- I was bluffing. It sucked, they all sucked.

318
00:18:39,677 --> 00:18:43,348
Do you want me to kiss your ass?
Because I will. Come on, turn around.

319
00:18:43,515 --> 00:18:45,725
- Come on.
- Alan, cut it out.

320
00:18:45,892 --> 00:18:47,602
I mean it. You're the boss.

321
00:18:47,769 --> 00:18:50,271
I'd rather be a second-class
citizen here in paradise...

322
00:18:50,438 --> 00:18:53,650
than king of a urine-soaked firetrap
next to Burbank Airport.

323
00:18:54,734 --> 00:18:57,070
Alan, Alan, calm down. Calm down.

324
00:18:57,529 --> 00:18:59,489
If you wanna stay, you can stay.

325
00:18:59,656 --> 00:19:02,158
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

326
00:19:02,325 --> 00:19:04,285
Charlie, you have no idea
how bad it was.

327
00:19:04,452 --> 00:19:06,746
I couldn't bring a woman
to one of these places.

328
00:19:06,913 --> 00:19:10,291
The only way I'd ever have sex
was if I was molested by a rat.

329
00:19:11,126 --> 00:19:13,044
Pull yourself together.

330
00:19:13,211 --> 00:19:15,130
Now, go grab Jake
and we'll have dinner.

331
00:19:15,296 --> 00:19:16,714
Okay. Okay.

332
00:19:16,881 --> 00:19:19,592
- And thanks again.
- You're welcome.

333
00:19:28,476 --> 00:19:30,478
- Hey, hey, Charlie?
- What?

334
00:19:30,645 --> 00:19:33,690
Just before I went down on my knees...

335
00:19:34,691 --> 00:19:36,776
were you about to say something?

336
00:19:36,943 --> 00:19:38,027
I don't think so.

337
00:19:38,528 --> 00:19:41,406
Before I started weeping...

338
00:19:42,574 --> 00:19:44,242
you were gonna tell me to stay.

339
00:19:44,409 --> 00:19:45,827
No, I wasn't.

340
00:19:46,619 --> 00:19:49,998
Okay, you're not fooling anybody.

341
00:19:50,165 --> 00:19:51,708
You'd miss me if I was gone.

342
00:19:52,458 --> 00:19:55,712
Despite everything you've said,
we're brothers.

343
00:19:55,879 --> 00:19:59,549
And we have a bond that's deeper
and more meaningful than any—

344
00:20:06,222 --> 00:20:07,473
He folded, didn't he?

345
00:20:08,224 --> 00:20:11,019
My ass is covered with lip prints.

346
00:20:11,561 --> 00:20:12,604
Damn.

347
00:20:12,770 --> 00:20:14,439
Well, anyway.

348
00:20:14,606 --> 00:20:17,233
I guess you wanna head home
and see how Philip's doing.

349
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:18,943
Who?

350
00:20:20,236 --> 00:20:23,031
Philip. Your brother. Detoxing.

351
00:20:23,656 --> 00:20:25,325
Oh, yeah, sure.

352
00:20:25,491 --> 00:20:26,701
Philip.

353
00:20:26,868 --> 00:20:28,036
My brother.

354
00:20:36,377 --> 00:20:37,670
This isn't so bad.

355
00:20:45,344 --> 00:20:47,430
Seems reasonably safe.

356
00:20:47,596 --> 00:20:48,639
Oh, yeah.

357
00:20:48,806 --> 00:20:50,641
I'm sure the Valley Hacienda
crack dealers...

358
00:20:50,808 --> 00:20:53,436
have organized
some sort of neighborhood watch.

359
00:20:53,602 --> 00:20:57,606
We could make this work.
I think it's got a lot going for it.

360
00:21:07,783 --> 00:21:09,660
I'm not a big fan of the orange carpet.

361
00:21:10,786 --> 00:21:14,373
But part of the fun of a new place
is fixing it up, making it your own.

362
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:16,792
Slap on a coat of paint—

363
00:21:23,799 --> 00:21:27,553
—and of course, a little bleach
to take those blood stains in the tub.

364
00:21:28,179 --> 00:21:31,182
Or you could run home
and kiss your brother's ass repeatedly.

365
00:21:31,348 --> 00:21:33,434
Couldn't you just say, "l told you so"?
