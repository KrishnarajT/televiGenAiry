1
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:08,385
That's a cool snake tattoo
on your back.

2
00:00:08,552 --> 00:00:13,390
Thanks. That's Anacoth,
the demon who eats human souls.

3
00:00:13,557 --> 00:00:16,602
My friend Jeffrey has a dog
that eats its own poop.

4
00:00:16,769 --> 00:00:19,021
He tries to lick our face
but we don't let him.

5
00:00:20,272 --> 00:00:22,733
- Okay.
- Who's that one?

6
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:25,319
That's the Goddess of the Damned.

7
00:00:25,486 --> 00:00:27,571
She whose name cannot be spoken.

8
00:00:27,738 --> 00:00:30,741
- Why, is it hard to pronounce?
- What?

9
00:00:31,241 --> 00:00:35,788
We have a friend at school like that.
He's from lndia. We just call him Rusty.

10
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:37,623
No kidding.

11
00:00:37,790 --> 00:00:39,541
- Does it hurt to get tattoos?
- Yeah.

12
00:00:39,708 --> 00:00:42,294
- But it's worth it, you know?
- Sure.

13
00:00:42,461 --> 00:00:45,506
Once I bit my tongue really hard
eating a frozen Milky Way...

14
00:00:45,673 --> 00:00:48,217
but it was totally worth it.

15
00:00:51,053 --> 00:00:52,721
- Good morning.
- Hey, Dad.

16
00:00:53,305 --> 00:00:56,225
- Hey.
- Hi, I'm Alan, Jake's dad.

17
00:00:56,642 --> 00:00:59,103
- lsabella.
- She's a friend of Uncle Charlie's.

18
00:01:00,062 --> 00:01:02,189
I would hope so.

19
00:01:02,648 --> 00:01:04,650
Yeah,
and she was showing me her tattoos.

20
00:01:04,817 --> 00:01:05,859
Lucky you.

21
00:01:06,026 --> 00:01:09,822
There was a time you'd have to pay a
quarter and go into a tent to see that.

22
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:13,117
Now it's right at your breakfast table.

23
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:16,787
- Go get dressed.
- I wanna see the rest of her tattoos.

24
00:01:16,954 --> 00:01:18,414
- Go.
- I have a quarter.

25
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:19,915
Jake.

26
00:01:20,457 --> 00:01:22,418
All right.

27
00:01:24,086 --> 00:01:27,798
Isabella, I hate to be a fuddy-duddy
but we keep the house smoke free.

28
00:01:27,965 --> 00:01:29,842
I'm sorry.

29
00:01:32,594 --> 00:01:35,722
Charlie didn't say anything
when I was smoking in bed last night.

30
00:01:35,889 --> 00:01:40,144
Yeah, well, Charlie's lungs aren't always
on the same page as his penis.

31
00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:44,439
- Morning, baby.
- Hey.

32
00:01:53,198 --> 00:01:55,325
If you don't like it, don't watch.

33
00:01:58,954 --> 00:02:01,832
I'm gonna go upstairs
and take a shower. You wanna join me?

34
00:02:01,999 --> 00:02:05,836
Sure. Just let me get some fluids in me
so I got something to work with.

35
00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:09,214
Hurry. Anacoth is hungry.

36
00:02:12,301 --> 00:02:13,886
Anacoth is hungry?

37
00:02:14,219 --> 00:02:15,971
She's referring to her snake tattoo.

38
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:20,851
Her vagina is called Linda.

39
00:02:22,394 --> 00:02:23,896
Pretty name.

40
00:02:24,062 --> 00:02:26,064
Listen,
I don't wanna overstep my bounds.

41
00:02:26,231 --> 00:02:29,234
This is your house and you're free
to bring into it whoever...

42
00:02:29,401 --> 00:02:31,278
or whatever you choose.

43
00:02:31,445 --> 00:02:33,113
But I do think I have the right...

44
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:36,033
to protect Jake
from being exposed to certain people.

45
00:02:36,199 --> 00:02:38,076
Well, you'd better take him to a hotel.

46
00:02:38,243 --> 00:02:40,871
Because that girl ain't leaving
till one of us is dead.

47
00:02:41,038 --> 00:02:42,372
- Come on, Charlie.
- No. No.

48
00:02:42,539 --> 00:02:45,167
You come on.
You see a little body ink and cigarette...

49
00:02:45,334 --> 00:02:47,002
and you immediately condemn her.

50
00:02:47,169 --> 00:02:49,504
She's smart,
she's got a great sense of humor...

51
00:02:49,671 --> 00:02:53,800
and in bed she moves like one of those
paint shakers at Sherwin-Williams.

52
00:02:57,596 --> 00:03:01,850
Nevertheless, I would rather
she didn't hang around Jake.

53
00:03:02,225 --> 00:03:03,393
Fine. I'll talk to her.

54
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:05,437
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

55
00:03:05,604 --> 00:03:07,856
Now, unless you wanna lather up
my fanny...

56
00:03:08,023 --> 00:03:11,360
I'm gonna go hop in the shower
with Anacoth and Linda.

57
00:03:49,856 --> 00:03:52,859
Isabella. I— I didn't hear you come in.

58
00:03:53,026 --> 00:03:54,235
You weren't meant to.

59
00:03:55,278 --> 00:03:56,946
So...

60
00:03:58,364 --> 00:04:00,575
you think I'm a bad influence
on your kid?

61
00:04:01,743 --> 00:04:04,954
Well, gee, I wouldn't put it that way.

62
00:04:05,121 --> 00:04:07,123
But, you know,
kids are impressionable.

63
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:12,295
And the violent psychosexual imagery
of your body art...

64
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:14,214
not to mention the smoking...

65
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:18,092
aren't something a young boy
needs to— Why are you taking my hair?

66
00:04:18,885 --> 00:04:20,720
Just a little quirk of mine.

67
00:04:25,308 --> 00:04:27,936
I used to collect stamps.

68
00:04:28,353 --> 00:04:31,898
You know, people like you
have been persecuting people like me...

69
00:04:32,065 --> 00:04:34,233
for thousands of years.

70
00:04:36,361 --> 00:04:38,529
Well, that's a bit hard to believe.

71
00:04:38,696 --> 00:04:43,076
Seeing as people like me
have historically been victims and food.

72
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,913
But just for clarity...

73
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:49,582
who exactly are the people like you?

74
00:04:49,749 --> 00:04:53,836
Those whose eyes are open to a greater
reality than you could ever imagine.

75
00:04:54,379 --> 00:04:56,047
I see.

76
00:04:56,214 --> 00:04:59,342
And do they all collect hair?

77
00:05:00,593 --> 00:05:04,180
- Don't mock what you don't understand.
- I'm sorry.

78
00:05:04,347 --> 00:05:08,768
I tend to resort to mocking
when I'm totally creeped out.

79
00:05:09,602 --> 00:05:10,937
I don't like you.

80
00:05:12,313 --> 00:05:13,690
Yeah, well...

81
00:05:13,856 --> 00:05:16,859
I'm rubber, you're glue.

82
00:05:17,443 --> 00:05:20,238
Something, something, something, you.

83
00:05:22,824 --> 00:05:24,784
So be it.

84
00:05:28,955 --> 00:05:30,832
So be it.

85
00:05:34,502 --> 00:05:37,130
So be it.

86
00:05:44,137 --> 00:05:45,763
Damn it.

87
00:05:51,352 --> 00:05:53,396
What the hell?

88
00:05:59,777 --> 00:06:01,195
I don't think so, Mom.

89
00:06:01,696 --> 00:06:05,533
First of all, I'm just not a big fan
of costume parties.

90
00:06:08,077 --> 00:06:11,664
Yeah, Jake likes The Wizard of Oz.
I don't think he'd enjoy hanging out...

91
00:06:11,831 --> 00:06:15,835
with a bunch of drunken real-estate
agents dressed like Judy Garland.

92
00:06:17,128 --> 00:06:18,379
Okay, I'll get him.

93
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:21,591
Mom wants to ask you something.

94
00:06:22,341 --> 00:06:24,594
Hi, Mom. No.

95
00:06:28,264 --> 00:06:30,057
What happened to your face?

96
00:06:30,224 --> 00:06:34,437
Nothing, I just thought I'd put little
blood-soaked pieces of toilet paper on it.

97
00:06:35,062 --> 00:06:36,856
What do you think?

98
00:06:37,315 --> 00:06:39,025
It suits you.

99
00:06:39,984 --> 00:06:43,988
- What's the deal with your eye?
- I don't know. I think I'm getting a sty.

100
00:06:44,155 --> 00:06:47,074
Might be a bit much
with the toilet paper.

101
00:06:47,241 --> 00:06:48,951
I'd go with one or the other.

102
00:06:49,118 --> 00:06:52,163
- Thank you for your input.
- No problem.

103
00:06:52,413 --> 00:06:54,874
- Where you going?
- lsabella's taking me to a party.

104
00:06:55,041 --> 00:06:56,918
She said it's gonna be out of control.

105
00:06:57,084 --> 00:07:00,213
Can you imagine what this girl
considers to be out of control?

106
00:07:00,379 --> 00:07:03,883
Well, let's see.
Biting the head off a live chicken?

107
00:07:05,384 --> 00:07:06,844
Vivisecting homeless people...

108
00:07:07,011 --> 00:07:09,972
and playing Hacky Sack
with their still-beating hearts?

109
00:07:10,514 --> 00:07:11,891
What are you talking about?

110
00:07:12,058 --> 00:07:14,727
Do you have any idea
what lsabella is really into?

111
00:07:14,894 --> 00:07:16,479
So she's a little kinky.

112
00:07:16,646 --> 00:07:19,899
No, no, no.
Kinky is a feather duster up your butt.

113
00:07:20,691 --> 00:07:23,277
I think this woman
tried to put a curse on me.

114
00:07:23,444 --> 00:07:25,571
Oh, please.
Who of us hasn't done that?

115
00:07:26,864 --> 00:07:28,616
To know you is to curse you.

116
00:07:28,783 --> 00:07:30,076
She took my hair.

117
00:07:31,702 --> 00:07:33,079
- She took your hair?
- Y eah.

118
00:07:33,246 --> 00:07:35,998
Yeah. And then she laughed like:

119
00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:42,505
- Oh, well, that's different.
- So you see my concern?

120
00:07:42,672 --> 00:07:44,548
Yes, I do. Good night.

121
00:07:45,091 --> 00:07:46,634
Where you going?

122
00:07:46,801 --> 00:07:49,303
To pick up a bottle of wine
and a feather duster.

123
00:07:55,726 --> 00:07:58,104
You sure my Mercedes
is okay parked on the street?

124
00:07:58,270 --> 00:08:01,691
I mean, I gave that crack whore $10
to watch it but now I'm thinking...

125
00:08:01,857 --> 00:08:03,651
who's watching the crack whore?

126
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:06,404
Don't worry about your car.

127
00:08:09,532 --> 00:08:11,117
Okay.

128
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:18,290
So where are all the guys?

129
00:08:18,749 --> 00:08:21,669
How come I'm the only weenie
in this pot of beans?

130
00:08:21,836 --> 00:08:25,673
- Because this party is in your honor.
- Really? What did I do?

131
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:28,092
You're a vessel of the masculine
life force.

132
00:08:28,259 --> 00:08:29,885
You picked up on that?

133
00:08:30,052 --> 00:08:33,222
I tell people that all the time
and they just get snotty.

134
00:08:33,556 --> 00:08:37,977
These women are all my sisters.
They all want to please you.

135
00:08:41,564 --> 00:08:44,358
Well, gosh, that's swell.

136
00:08:45,526 --> 00:08:47,987
- Then you're okay with this?
- lt was my idea.

137
00:08:48,154 --> 00:08:52,366
Let me tell you something, lsabella,
you are just tops in my book.

138
00:08:53,951 --> 00:08:56,036
This is very tasty.
What'd you say this was?

139
00:08:56,203 --> 00:08:59,123
- A secret elixir.
- Secret elixir, huh?

140
00:08:59,290 --> 00:09:01,917
I'm more of a bourbon guy
but push comes to shove...

141
00:09:02,084 --> 00:09:04,336
I don't know
what the hell's in that either.

142
00:09:06,422 --> 00:09:10,009
Oh, boy.
Getting a little fuzzy around the edges.

143
00:09:11,802 --> 00:09:13,220
Got any crackers?

144
00:09:14,513 --> 00:09:18,350
- He's ready.
- You bet your gothic ass I am.

145
00:09:23,814 --> 00:09:26,192
- Where are we going?
- T o the altar room.

146
00:09:26,358 --> 00:09:29,153
Oh, boy. What's the altar room?

147
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,529
It's where we anoint you.

148
00:09:30,696 --> 00:09:33,866
Oh, boy. I'm getting anointed.

149
00:09:34,033 --> 00:09:35,868
Sounds nasty.

150
00:09:36,035 --> 00:09:38,370
- Anoint him.
- Anoint him.

151
00:09:38,537 --> 00:09:39,580
Anoint him.

152
00:09:39,747 --> 00:09:40,831
Anoint him.

153
00:09:40,998 --> 00:09:44,710
Anoint him. Anoint him. Anoint him.

154
00:09:44,877 --> 00:09:49,507
Anoint him. Anoint him. Anoint him.

155
00:09:49,673 --> 00:09:54,136
Anoint him. Anoint him. Anoint him.

156
00:09:54,303 --> 00:09:56,764
Anoint him. Anoint him.

157
00:10:04,939 --> 00:10:06,857
- Morning.
- Morning.

158
00:10:07,024 --> 00:10:09,401
Great googly-mooglies.

159
00:10:09,818 --> 00:10:13,113
- What the hell happened to you?
- l' m not sure.

160
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:16,700
Looks like you got bit in the face
by one of them Ebola monkeys.

161
00:10:17,076 --> 00:10:18,244
I don't think so, Berta.

162
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:21,080
I mean,
you weren't exactly eye-candy going in.

163
00:10:22,456 --> 00:10:24,083
But now:

164
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:26,919
You could scare the flies
off a manure truck.

165
00:10:27,628 --> 00:10:31,674
Thank you. Until you said that
I was feeling a little self-conscious.

166
00:10:32,091 --> 00:10:34,635
- You know I'm razzing you, don't you?
- Yeah.

167
00:10:34,802 --> 00:10:39,098
I mean, it's really not that— Oh,
sweet lord, I'm gonna lose my Eggos.

168
00:10:39,265 --> 00:10:44,103
Okay, if open-mike night
in the burn ward is over...

169
00:10:44,270 --> 00:10:48,440
I'm gonna make breakfast and get out
before Charlie's new girlfriend gets up.

170
00:10:48,607 --> 00:10:50,734
Why,
is she not as compassionate as me?

171
00:10:51,777 --> 00:10:53,404
She's just a very creepy woman.

172
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:56,991
Well, putting aside
the whole pot-kettle thing, creepy how?

173
00:10:57,866 --> 00:11:00,869
Well, she's got tattoos all over her.

174
00:11:01,036 --> 00:11:02,997
I've got tattoos.

175
00:11:04,498 --> 00:11:07,042
And she's got this very dark,
hostile attitude.

176
00:11:08,377 --> 00:11:10,462
Okay, you might actually like her...

177
00:11:10,963 --> 00:11:13,465
but I don't want to have anything
to do with her.

178
00:11:13,632 --> 00:11:15,217
Good morning.

179
00:11:16,635 --> 00:11:18,053
Isabella. Hello.

180
00:11:18,762 --> 00:11:21,056
That's a nasty looking eye
you've got there.

181
00:11:21,557 --> 00:11:23,392
It's just a sty.

182
00:11:25,728 --> 00:11:27,062
Right?

183
00:11:28,731 --> 00:11:30,190
What else would it be?

184
00:11:32,526 --> 00:11:34,778
Hey, Vampira...

185
00:11:35,988 --> 00:11:39,199
tell Count Humpula to get out of bed
so I can change his sheets.

186
00:11:41,827 --> 00:11:44,246
Charlie and I are spending the entire day
in bed.

187
00:11:44,413 --> 00:11:47,624
We do not want to be disturbed.
Do you understand?

188
00:11:49,918 --> 00:11:52,588
Is it getting cold in here?

189
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:55,841
Do you understand?

190
00:11:56,008 --> 00:11:57,259
Yep. You betcha.

191
00:11:58,552 --> 00:11:59,803
Thank you.

192
00:12:00,679 --> 00:12:03,307
Bye, Alan. Take care of that eye.

193
00:12:03,474 --> 00:12:07,644
I will. Thank you.
You see what I mean about—?

194
00:12:10,022 --> 00:12:11,440
- What are you doing?
- Leaving.

195
00:12:11,607 --> 00:12:15,110
- Why?
- Did you see that bitch?

196
00:12:17,196 --> 00:12:20,741
You gotta put a whole lot of gone
between you and a broad like that.

197
00:12:22,534 --> 00:12:24,912
- But wait a second—
- Goodbye and good luck.

198
00:12:48,602 --> 00:12:50,229
That is some sty.

199
00:12:50,395 --> 00:12:53,148
This is no sty. This is something else.
Something evil.

200
00:12:53,315 --> 00:12:55,150
Something ugly.

201
00:12:55,317 --> 00:12:58,237
You know what? I'm starting to think
your girlfriend did this.

202
00:12:58,403 --> 00:13:01,865
- Oh, come on.
- Charlie, this isn't just about me.

203
00:13:02,032 --> 00:13:04,743
Have you taken a look
at yourself recently?

204
00:13:04,993 --> 00:13:06,954
Oh, man.

205
00:13:08,330 --> 00:13:11,500
It's gonna take more than
a little spray-on tan to fix that.

206
00:13:11,667 --> 00:13:14,670
Do you realize how long
you've been upstairs with her?

207
00:13:14,836 --> 00:13:16,004
- That depends.
- On what?

208
00:13:16,171 --> 00:13:17,548
On what day it is.

209
00:13:17,965 --> 00:13:21,510
It's Sunday evening. I haven't seen you
since you went to that party.

210
00:13:21,677 --> 00:13:23,554
Oh, yeah, the party.

211
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:26,014
- That was some great party.
- What happened?

212
00:13:26,181 --> 00:13:28,016
I have no idea.

213
00:13:29,017 --> 00:13:30,686
Although, I did wake up with this.

214
00:13:33,146 --> 00:13:37,067
- Oh, my God.
- Am I Jewish now?

215
00:13:41,196 --> 00:13:43,991
Charlie, that's not the Star of David,
it's a pentagram.

216
00:13:44,157 --> 00:13:47,202
It's a satanic symbol
used to call forth demons from hell.

217
00:13:48,412 --> 00:13:50,372
Oh, that's not good.

218
00:13:51,581 --> 00:13:53,750
- You need to cut lsabella loose.
- I can't.

219
00:13:53,917 --> 00:13:55,043
Why not?

220
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:57,879
Because together we shall spawn
a child named Giglamesh.

221
00:13:58,046 --> 00:14:01,133
And he shall bring forth
a new age of darkness.

222
00:14:02,968 --> 00:14:06,305
You know, maybe it's time to slow
this relationship down a little bit.

223
00:14:06,471 --> 00:14:09,850
Slow it down? You need to drive a stake
through its heart.

224
00:14:10,017 --> 00:14:12,894
- ls she still here?
- Yeah.

225
00:14:13,061 --> 00:14:14,980
Okay, here's the plan.

226
00:14:15,147 --> 00:14:19,359
So we'll submit to her will and serve the
Lord Beelzebub with all our hearts.

227
00:14:20,652 --> 00:14:21,695
I'll grab Jake.

228
00:14:21,862 --> 00:14:25,323
You start the car. We'll drive somewhere
safe. I'm thinking the Vatican.

229
00:14:26,867 --> 00:14:29,202
- Don't be ridiculous.
- What are you gonna do?

230
00:14:29,369 --> 00:14:32,497
- You said it. We have to cut her loose.
- "We"? I didn't say "we. "

231
00:14:32,664 --> 00:14:34,249
I never said "we. "

232
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:38,754
Hear us, oh, Horned One.

233
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:42,507
Wrap your dark wings
around this young soul...

234
00:14:42,674 --> 00:14:46,595
and grant him
all the rewards he desires.

235
00:14:48,638 --> 00:14:52,517
Okay, hi, Mr. Horned One.

236
00:14:55,437 --> 00:14:58,774
Here's the deal,
I'll trade you my soul for—

237
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:01,109
What do I get, like, three wishes?

238
00:15:01,276 --> 00:15:04,237
He's the Lord of the Underworld,
not a genie.

239
00:15:04,404 --> 00:15:07,491
Oh, okay. Can I talk to a genie?

240
00:15:09,451 --> 00:15:10,869
Jake, get over here.

241
00:15:11,036 --> 00:15:13,997
Sorry, Dad,
but you're no longer my master.

242
00:15:14,164 --> 00:15:16,124
The hell I'm not. Go to your room.

243
00:15:16,291 --> 00:15:18,376
I'm old enough
to choose my own religion.

244
00:15:18,543 --> 00:15:20,003
Go.

245
00:15:23,465 --> 00:15:25,383
How dare you interfere?

246
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:26,968
Good question.

247
00:15:27,135 --> 00:15:30,472
Alan, tell her how we dare.

248
00:15:31,223 --> 00:15:33,809
Hey, you brought her here,
you get her out.

249
00:15:33,975 --> 00:15:35,852
Are you trying to get rid of me?

250
00:15:36,228 --> 00:15:39,231
Okay, well, no, not you personally.

251
00:15:39,397 --> 00:15:41,191
This is more of a legal issue.

252
00:15:41,358 --> 00:15:44,861
It turns out Malibu is not zoned
for satanic rituals.

253
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:49,491
Or any of the black arts, really.
Right, Alan?

254
00:15:49,658 --> 00:15:52,077
That's true. You're fine in Hollywood.

255
00:15:54,162 --> 00:15:57,874
Pretty much anywhere
east of the 405 freeway, actually.

256
00:15:58,041 --> 00:16:01,002
- Shut up, Alan.
- Just trying to help.

257
00:16:01,461 --> 00:16:03,672
Did you really think
that you can end this?

258
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:05,507
I was kind of hoping.

259
00:16:05,924 --> 00:16:08,843
Don't you realize that our souls
are now bound together...

260
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:12,514
destined to writhe ecstatically
in blessed hellfire for all eternity?

261
00:16:17,185 --> 00:16:19,479
Boy, I know how to pick them,
don't l?

262
00:16:20,272 --> 00:16:24,484
Charlie, do you remember
the vows you took last night?

263
00:16:25,443 --> 00:16:27,529
- Vows?
- You took vows? What kind of vows?

264
00:16:27,696 --> 00:16:29,864
If you'll shut up, maybe we'll find out.

265
00:16:31,157 --> 00:16:34,411
You vowed unending fealty
to the sisterhood of the coven.

266
00:16:34,953 --> 00:16:36,705
You did that? Why would you do that?

267
00:16:36,871 --> 00:16:38,206
Will you please shut up?

268
00:16:39,958 --> 00:16:42,460
I did that? Why would I do that?

269
00:16:42,627 --> 00:16:45,422
Did you think those beautiful women
were pleasuring you...

270
00:16:45,589 --> 00:16:47,591
because of your boyish charm?

271
00:16:47,757 --> 00:16:50,760
Well. No, not all of them.

272
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:56,182
I just figured after the first three or four,
word of mouth started to spread.

273
00:16:59,102 --> 00:17:02,105
Wait, wait, how many women
are we talking about here?

274
00:17:02,272 --> 00:17:03,565
I don't know. Nine, 10—

275
00:17:03,732 --> 00:17:07,402
Thirteen. The sacred number.

276
00:17:07,861 --> 00:17:10,488
And a personal best for me.

277
00:17:12,198 --> 00:17:14,576
How do you have sex
with 13 women at one time?

278
00:17:14,743 --> 00:17:17,746
Well, apparently,
you have to take some vows.

279
00:17:18,955 --> 00:17:21,374
Okay, okay, listen.

280
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:24,627
Thank the girls for me,
tell them I had a wonderful time...

281
00:17:24,794 --> 00:17:27,505
but tell them I have to pass
on the fealty stuff.

282
00:17:27,672 --> 00:17:31,051
I have a previous commitment to,
you know, God.

283
00:17:32,344 --> 00:17:34,095
It doesn't work that way, Charlie.

284
00:17:34,262 --> 00:17:35,472
If you break your vows...

285
00:17:35,638 --> 00:17:38,767
you bring down upon yourself
the ancient curse of betrayal.

286
00:17:38,933 --> 00:17:42,228
- Well, that's the chance I'll have to take.
- So be it.

287
00:17:42,395 --> 00:17:44,481
So be it.

288
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:50,820
Just kidding.

289
00:17:51,446 --> 00:17:55,241
Simply out of curiosity,
what exactly is this curse?

290
00:17:55,408 --> 00:17:57,452
What should I be on the lookout for?

291
00:17:57,619 --> 00:18:01,289
- Your crops will wither in the field.
- Yeah, okay.

292
00:18:03,041 --> 00:18:06,044
Your cattle will sicken and die.

293
00:18:08,838 --> 00:18:13,343
Your manhood will shrivel
and become a useless husk.

294
00:18:16,304 --> 00:18:17,806
I gotta fold here, Alan.

295
00:18:19,766 --> 00:18:21,351
Okay, you got me.

296
00:18:21,518 --> 00:18:25,188
What do you say we call the girls over
and start spawning baby Giglamesh?

297
00:18:25,355 --> 00:18:28,066
- Don't do this.
- Hey, when she's shriveling your husk...

298
00:18:28,233 --> 00:18:30,026
then you get a vote.

299
00:18:32,237 --> 00:18:34,614
Go ahead, call the coven.

300
00:18:37,617 --> 00:18:41,329
Wow, you gals could make a fortune
delivering pizzas.

301
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:47,252
Mom?

302
00:18:47,877 --> 00:18:49,712
Boo, everybody.

303
00:18:53,466 --> 00:18:55,426
Now, not a word, Charlie.

304
00:18:55,593 --> 00:18:58,054
You're all coming with me
to my costume party...

305
00:18:58,221 --> 00:19:00,390
and I'm not taking no for an answer.

306
00:19:00,557 --> 00:19:02,392
Evelyn?

307
00:19:03,726 --> 00:19:04,894
Isabella.

308
00:19:07,438 --> 00:19:09,732
You know each other?

309
00:19:09,899 --> 00:19:12,235
In a manner of speaking.

310
00:19:15,488 --> 00:19:18,533
- What are you doing here?
- Nothing.

311
00:19:19,117 --> 00:19:20,952
These are my sons.

312
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:28,001
It was an accident. I had no idea.

313
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:29,669
Please, believe me.

314
00:19:30,003 --> 00:19:31,337
Goodbye, lsabella.

315
00:19:31,754 --> 00:19:33,339
Yes, goodbye.

316
00:19:35,883 --> 00:19:39,554
- Bye, Charlie.
- Hold on, hold on.

317
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:42,890
What about the vows,
the curse and the shriveling?

318
00:19:44,017 --> 00:19:45,893
I have no idea what he's talking about.

319
00:19:53,067 --> 00:19:55,361
What? She's in my Pilates class.

320
00:19:58,573 --> 00:20:00,199
- I'll buy that.
- Okay.

321
00:20:00,366 --> 00:20:04,245
Now, are you coming to my party
or you gonna give me a hard time?

322
00:20:08,249 --> 00:20:10,209
- I'm coming to the party.
- Me too.

323
00:20:10,376 --> 00:20:12,253
Jake, come get your costume.

324
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:14,756
- What's Mom gonna wear?
- Shut up.

325
00:20:20,177 --> 00:20:24,514
Let's go. Grand-mommy doesn't want
to be late to her costume party.

326
00:20:57,047 --> 00:21:00,967
Oh, come on, boys. Sell it.

327
00:21:12,896 --> 00:21:15,190
Very nice.

328
00:21:15,357 --> 00:21:18,985
Now fly, my pets, fly.

329
00:21:21,738 --> 00:21:23,865
I call shotgun.
