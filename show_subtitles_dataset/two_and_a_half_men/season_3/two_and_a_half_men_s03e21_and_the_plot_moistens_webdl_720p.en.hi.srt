1
00:00:03,604 --> 00:00:07,191
Alan, do you ever fantasize
when we're making love?

2
00:00:07,358 --> 00:00:12,363
Well, occasionally I pretend
that I'm better looking.

3
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:15,282
What about you?

4
00:00:15,449 --> 00:00:20,079
Sometimes I imagine we're
in the middle of a big department store.

5
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:22,206
Having sex?

6
00:00:22,373 --> 00:00:25,000
No, shopping.

7
00:00:25,751 --> 00:00:29,213
Why would I fantasize about having sex
while I'm having sex?

8
00:00:29,838 --> 00:00:34,009
Do you think about ham and cheese
when you're eating a sandwich?

9
00:00:34,510 --> 00:00:36,887
Can't argue with that.

10
00:00:39,473 --> 00:00:42,268
What you thinking?

11
00:00:43,519 --> 00:00:48,566
Nothing really. I just—
I got a call from Jake's school today.

12
00:00:48,732 --> 00:00:51,443
You know who called me?
Jessica Murray.

13
00:00:51,610 --> 00:00:52,653
Oh, who's that?

14
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:55,114
A friend of mine.

15
00:00:57,032 --> 00:00:59,410
Yeah, well...

16
00:00:59,743 --> 00:01:03,831
Anyway, Jake's mom and I have to go to
a parent-teacher conference tomorrow...

17
00:01:03,998 --> 00:01:06,166
and I don't really know
what it's about.

18
00:01:08,294 --> 00:01:12,423
Hey, do you ever pretend
your toes are little people?

19
00:01:12,673 --> 00:01:14,341
What? No.

20
00:01:14,508 --> 00:01:19,555
Sometimes I make believe they're
different families playing Family Feud.

21
00:01:20,014 --> 00:01:21,974
All right, let's meet our champions.

22
00:01:22,141 --> 00:01:28,480
He goes to market, she stays home,
please welcome the Piggy family.

23
00:01:28,647 --> 00:01:30,024
Hi, everybody.

24
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:35,779
You' re going down Piggy family.
You're going down.

25
00:01:40,909 --> 00:01:43,829
- Hey.
- Hey.

26
00:01:45,039 --> 00:01:49,293
He's shooting 51 percent
from beyond the arc. That's pretty good.

27
00:01:57,259 --> 00:01:58,844
How's it going?

28
00:01:59,011 --> 00:02:00,471
Forget it, Alan.

29
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:05,642
I only do the après-sex chat
with people I've just had sex with.

30
00:02:05,809 --> 00:02:09,313
Come on. She's playing
Family Feud with her toes.

31
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:13,692
I don't care if she's playing banjo
with her nipples.

32
00:02:14,109 --> 00:02:17,529
I need to communicate
after lovemaking. I need to share.

33
00:02:17,696 --> 00:02:20,324
You should have thought of that
before boinking a girl...

34
00:02:20,491 --> 00:02:22,117
with the lQ of Tickle Me Elmo.

35
00:02:25,579 --> 00:02:27,623
Fine.

36
00:02:28,707 --> 00:02:30,084
Hey, Berta. How's it going?

37
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:31,376
Back off, zippy.

38
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:35,172
You want pillow talk,
you gotta spoon me first.

39
00:02:51,938 --> 00:02:55,025
I suppose I could talk about
his grades again...

40
00:02:55,191 --> 00:02:59,029
but I think we all agree
that ship has pretty much sailed.

41
00:03:00,613 --> 00:03:03,074
So why did you wanna see us?

42
00:03:03,241 --> 00:03:08,204
Well, I'm concerned
that even outside of the classroom...

43
00:03:08,371 --> 00:03:12,000
Jake has no interest in anything
that goes on around here.

44
00:03:12,167 --> 00:03:16,921
Now, hang on. He speaks very highly
of your hot lunch program.

45
00:03:17,756 --> 00:03:22,969
Well, I was talking more about hobbies
or extracurricular activities.

46
00:03:23,136 --> 00:03:25,096
Well, I don't know about his father...

47
00:03:25,263 --> 00:03:28,183
but I've tried to share
some of my interests with him.

48
00:03:28,349 --> 00:03:32,645
Unfortunately, he's a little young
to drink in the dark and bitch about men.

49
00:03:37,567 --> 00:03:39,778
You know...

50
00:03:39,944 --> 00:03:45,033
I was kind of lacking in focus
when I was his age too...

51
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,368
till I got bit by the old theater bug.

52
00:03:47,535 --> 00:03:50,205
Too bad you didn't get bit
by the old rabid squirrel.

53
00:03:52,957 --> 00:03:56,211
You know, I'm organizing
a drama club.

54
00:03:56,377 --> 00:03:59,214
Would that be something
Jake would have any interest in...

55
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:01,758
or do you think he gets
enough drama at home?

56
00:04:04,135 --> 00:04:05,970
All the world's a stage.

57
00:04:06,137 --> 00:04:07,597
And we are merely players.

58
00:04:12,143 --> 00:04:15,021
Bubble, bubble, toil and trouble.

59
00:04:18,691 --> 00:04:20,443
She say what I'm in trouble for?

60
00:04:20,610 --> 00:04:22,445
Nope.

61
00:04:22,612 --> 00:04:25,031
Boy, it's the not knowing
that drives you crazy.

62
00:04:25,198 --> 00:04:28,535
Yeah, like a pregnancy test.

63
00:04:28,701 --> 00:04:30,370
Yeah.

64
00:04:30,537 --> 00:04:32,705
I don't get it.

65
00:04:36,292 --> 00:04:39,420
Yes. In your face, Opie.

66
00:04:39,838 --> 00:04:41,256
This game stinks.

67
00:04:41,422 --> 00:04:43,091
No, you stink at it.

68
00:04:43,675 --> 00:04:45,051
That was my lunch money.

69
00:04:45,218 --> 00:04:48,012
Oh, your lunch money,
why didn't you tell me?

70
00:04:48,179 --> 00:04:51,558
Boo-freaking-hoo. Pack a sandwich.

71
00:04:52,767 --> 00:04:55,728
Okay, Jake, well, we talked
to Miss Sheffield.

72
00:04:55,895 --> 00:04:57,355
I'm sorry.

73
00:04:57,522 --> 00:05:01,234
- What are you sorry about?
- I'm...

74
00:05:01,734 --> 00:05:04,362
I'm sorry I interrupted you. Go ahead.

75
00:05:04,988 --> 00:05:09,158
It would be a good idea if you got
involved in extracurricular activities.

76
00:05:09,325 --> 00:05:10,702
Oh, okay.

77
00:05:10,868 --> 00:05:13,580
Great, great.
We'll talk about it at home.

78
00:05:17,041 --> 00:05:19,419
Do you know
what an "extracurricular activity" is?

79
00:05:19,586 --> 00:05:22,547
Who cares? I'm off the hook.

80
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:42,734
- What do you think?
- What was this all about?

81
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:45,653
- It's choreography.
- It's gay.

82
00:05:46,279 --> 00:05:47,822
Okay.
Forget about the movements.

83
00:05:47,989 --> 00:05:49,490
- Just try singing the song.
- No.

84
00:05:49,657 --> 00:05:52,535
- Why not?
- Because it's gay.

85
00:05:54,162 --> 00:05:55,204
Don't encourage him.

86
00:05:55,371 --> 00:05:57,790
Don't make him sing
Gilbert and Sullivan.

87
00:05:58,333 --> 00:06:02,086
He needs something to audition for the
school musical. You teach him a song.

88
00:06:02,253 --> 00:06:04,005
- Why don't you let him choose?
- Jake.

89
00:06:04,172 --> 00:06:08,718
- Tell you uncle what you wanted to sing.
- It's called "Whup That Stanky Ho. "

90
00:06:13,973 --> 00:06:16,809
All right. There's gotta be
some middle ground here.

91
00:06:17,769 --> 00:06:19,771
- You like classic rock, right?
- Yeah.

92
00:06:19,937 --> 00:06:21,439
Okay, well, pick a band.

93
00:06:22,273 --> 00:06:23,608
How about Queen?

94
00:06:23,775 --> 00:06:26,694
Oh, good. I was afraid
he was gonna pick something gay.

95
00:06:55,473 --> 00:06:57,391
Doesn't sound right.

96
00:06:57,558 --> 00:07:00,103
You heard it too, huh?

97
00:07:00,728 --> 00:07:03,815
- You sure you played all the right notes?
- Y es, I'm sure.

98
00:07:03,981 --> 00:07:06,442
It doesn't sound anything like
Queen's version.

99
00:07:06,943 --> 00:07:09,112
No, it doesn't.

100
00:07:09,278 --> 00:07:12,657
Why don't you work on it.
We'll try again tomorrow.

101
00:07:13,449 --> 00:07:16,452
Yeah, why don't I do that.

102
00:07:17,662 --> 00:07:19,330
The kid's a double threat:

103
00:07:19,497 --> 00:07:21,833
tone-deaf and arrogant.

104
00:07:23,584 --> 00:07:25,128
- Hey.
- Where have you been?

105
00:07:25,294 --> 00:07:26,587
Kandi called for you.

106
00:07:26,754 --> 00:07:28,464
Oh, I had to work late.

107
00:07:29,549 --> 00:07:32,385
Yeah, one of my regular patients
had a crisis.

108
00:07:32,552 --> 00:07:36,430
His name is Roger, he had
a couple of vertebrae pinching a nerve.

109
00:07:36,597 --> 00:07:38,599
- T oo bad.
- Nice guy, you'd like him.

110
00:07:39,642 --> 00:07:43,020
He restores old cars. Well, it's
actually more a hobby than a job.

111
00:07:43,187 --> 00:07:45,815
He works at Staples.
His name is Roger.

112
00:07:46,315 --> 00:07:47,817
- Alan.
- Yeah?

113
00:07:47,984 --> 00:07:49,735
Why are you lying to me?

114
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:52,363
I don't know. I really suck at it.

115
00:07:52,905 --> 00:07:54,073
You do indeed.

116
00:07:55,783 --> 00:07:57,326
Don't you care where I was?

117
00:07:58,035 --> 00:08:00,037
Why would I start now?

118
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:03,666
Oh, come on, I really need to get this
off my chest.

119
00:08:03,833 --> 00:08:05,501
All right, go ahead.

120
00:08:07,211 --> 00:08:11,173
- I was with another woman.
- Okay, okay, see, that's a good lie.

121
00:08:12,008 --> 00:08:14,927
No, no. I really was
with another woman.

122
00:08:15,636 --> 00:08:17,889
Seriously?

123
00:08:18,055 --> 00:08:21,517
You're already doing a hot 22-year-old
and you're cheating on her?

124
00:08:23,269 --> 00:08:24,312
Yes.

125
00:08:25,688 --> 00:08:27,940
I am so proud of you.

126
00:08:29,650 --> 00:08:33,613
- What?
- Who's the dog? My brother's the dog.

127
00:08:36,907 --> 00:08:40,036
Come on, dog. Come on, dog.
Howl with me.

128
00:08:48,210 --> 00:08:50,588
No, stop howling and let me explain.

129
00:08:50,755 --> 00:08:52,506
There's nothing to explain.

130
00:08:52,673 --> 00:08:56,302
You're sleeping with two women
at the same time. You're a big old dog.

131
00:08:56,469 --> 00:08:58,929
No, I haven't been sleeping
with the other woman.

132
00:09:01,932 --> 00:09:03,476
I've been seeing Jake's teacher.

133
00:09:07,021 --> 00:09:08,105
All we do is talk.

134
00:09:12,109 --> 00:09:14,945
I don't know how to explain it.
We have so much in common.

135
00:09:15,112 --> 00:09:17,698
I mean, she's divorced.
She has a kid Jake's age.

136
00:09:17,865 --> 00:09:19,492
She reads. She likes the theater.

137
00:09:19,658 --> 00:09:21,869
Yeah, yeah. But you're not
sleeping with her?

138
00:09:22,036 --> 00:09:26,165
- Why would I when I've got Kandi?
- I don't know. Because you can?

139
00:09:27,124 --> 00:09:29,835
It's not that kind of a relationship.
It's intellectual.

140
00:09:30,252 --> 00:09:34,423
So take her to a museum, enjoy
the exhibits and do her in the restroom.

141
00:09:35,174 --> 00:09:37,885
- You're missing the point.
- No, you're missing the point.

142
00:09:38,052 --> 00:09:39,887
Not getting laid, it's not cheating.

143
00:09:40,054 --> 00:09:44,058
- Then why do I feel so guilty?
- That's easy. Because you're an idiot.

144
00:09:44,517 --> 00:09:48,646
I guess I always thought that one woman
was supposed to fulfill all my needs.

145
00:09:48,813 --> 00:09:50,648
Oh, that's an old wives' tale.

146
00:09:50,815 --> 00:09:55,027
Started to protect the interests of,
you guessed it, old wives.

147
00:09:55,486 --> 00:09:58,322
So you're saying the whole concept
of monogamy is a fraud.

148
00:09:58,489 --> 00:10:01,534
- The institution of marriage is a sham?
- No, no, no.

149
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:05,079
I'm just saying, bang the teacher.

150
00:10:07,123 --> 00:10:10,501
Why does he make everything
so complicated?

151
00:10:16,923 --> 00:10:19,509
Here we go.

152
00:10:19,676 --> 00:10:22,387
"Blunderbuss. "

153
00:10:22,554 --> 00:10:24,973
Very elegant use of my "under. "

154
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:26,266
Thank you.

155
00:10:27,768 --> 00:10:31,021
Boy. I have more vowels
than a Honolulu phone book.

156
00:10:32,022 --> 00:10:33,690
You're so clever, Alan.

157
00:10:33,857 --> 00:10:37,235
Thank you. You am smart too.

158
00:10:37,402 --> 00:10:42,449
- Hey, Alan, can I talk to you for a sec?
- Sure. Excuse me.

159
00:10:42,616 --> 00:10:44,242
Hurry back.

160
00:10:46,578 --> 00:10:47,788
What's up?

161
00:10:47,954 --> 00:10:51,500
- You tell me.
- Nothing, we're just playing Scrabble.

162
00:10:51,667 --> 00:10:52,834
And you're right.

163
00:10:53,001 --> 00:10:56,797
- There's nothing to feel guilty about.
- Good to know. Because Kandi's here.

164
00:10:59,758 --> 00:11:01,760
Oh, okay.

165
00:11:02,928 --> 00:11:05,430
It's not a problem.
Here's what we do.

166
00:11:05,597 --> 00:11:08,475
- We?
- Come on, work with me.

167
00:11:09,601 --> 00:11:13,313
You go cover for me with Kandi
and I'll get Francine the hell out of here.

168
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:15,565
But there was nothing
to feel guilty about.

169
00:11:15,732 --> 00:11:18,610
You know that and I know that,
now go lie to Kandi about it.

170
00:11:19,694 --> 00:11:22,948
Fine, I'll tell her you went to Staples
to see Roger.

171
00:11:23,115 --> 00:11:24,991
Who?

172
00:11:27,369 --> 00:11:31,498
- Hey, why don't we walk on the beach.
- What about the game?

173
00:11:31,665 --> 00:11:34,042
Screw the game, I concede.
You win, well-played.

174
00:11:35,001 --> 00:11:37,129
All right.

175
00:11:37,295 --> 00:11:38,880
It is a beautiful night.

176
00:11:39,047 --> 00:11:41,925
Yeah, yeah. Let's go enjoy it
on the beach. Chop-chop.

177
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:50,642
- Kandi?
- What?

178
00:11:50,809 --> 00:11:52,519
Alan must have slipped out.

179
00:11:52,686 --> 00:11:55,522
- You're lying to me, Charlie.
- No, I'm not.

180
00:11:55,689 --> 00:11:57,315
Oh, okay.

181
00:11:57,482 --> 00:11:59,693
Wait, wait. Don't you wanna know
where he is?

182
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:02,821
- Where who is?
- Alan.

183
00:12:02,988 --> 00:12:05,532
Sure, why not.

184
00:12:06,241 --> 00:12:09,411
All right. The truth is...

185
00:12:09,578 --> 00:12:12,205
Alan is out trying to find
the perfect gift for you.

186
00:12:12,372 --> 00:12:13,874
- Really?
- Yes.

187
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:18,503
He wants to surprise you
with something extremely expensive.

188
00:12:20,338 --> 00:12:21,590
Can you give me a hint?

189
00:12:21,756 --> 00:12:23,341
Well, let's see.

190
00:12:23,508 --> 00:12:25,677
It's something
that's a girl's best friend...

191
00:12:25,844 --> 00:12:28,680
and looks good
wrapped around their neck.

192
00:12:29,222 --> 00:12:32,392
I'm getting a monkey?

193
00:12:33,977 --> 00:12:38,148
No, no. Sweet Lord.

194
00:12:38,315 --> 00:12:39,983
A diamond necklace.

195
00:12:41,484 --> 00:12:42,652
That's nice too.

196
00:12:43,236 --> 00:12:45,572
Just remember,
you didn't hear it from me.

197
00:12:45,739 --> 00:12:47,657
Then who did I hear it from?

198
00:12:50,285 --> 00:12:52,662
Nobody.

199
00:12:52,829 --> 00:12:55,040
When he gives it to you,
act surprised.

200
00:12:55,206 --> 00:12:57,542
Don't worry, I'll be really surprised.

201
00:12:57,709 --> 00:13:00,170
Good. Good. Good.

202
00:13:00,337 --> 00:13:03,006
So will he.

203
00:13:36,414 --> 00:13:39,626
That's— That's— That's terrific.

204
00:13:39,793 --> 00:13:42,295
- Do you wanna hear it again?
- No.

205
00:13:42,462 --> 00:13:44,506
We don't want you
to strain your voice.

206
00:13:44,673 --> 00:13:46,925
Do you think I'm gonna do okay
at the audition?

207
00:13:47,092 --> 00:13:49,844
- You never know how these things go.
- Yeah.

208
00:13:50,345 --> 00:13:53,139
Just hope I have
a decent piano player.

209
00:13:57,143 --> 00:13:59,813
I thought you were working with him.
What's the problem?

210
00:13:59,979 --> 00:14:02,399
Okay, there's a technical term
we musicians use.

211
00:14:04,025 --> 00:14:06,861
Jake stinks.

212
00:14:07,362 --> 00:14:09,030
Well, is there anything we can do?

213
00:14:09,197 --> 00:14:12,283
We can hope "stinks"
suddenly becomes popular.

214
00:14:12,450 --> 00:14:14,619
But I wouldn't count on it.

215
00:14:14,786 --> 00:14:18,415
Oh, by the way, you need
to buy Kandi a diamond necklace.

216
00:14:18,581 --> 00:14:20,125
What?

217
00:14:20,291 --> 00:14:23,336
You told me to cover.
I said you were out buying her jewelry.

218
00:14:23,503 --> 00:14:25,130
That's all you could think of?

219
00:14:25,797 --> 00:14:30,009
Well, I could think of a lot of things
but only one made me laugh.

220
00:14:30,844 --> 00:14:33,847
I can't afford to buy her jewelry.

221
00:14:34,389 --> 00:14:36,307
I know.

222
00:14:36,683 --> 00:14:39,811
That's what makes it funny.

223
00:14:44,607 --> 00:14:47,152
Must have been so expensive.

224
00:14:47,318 --> 00:14:49,654
Yeah.

225
00:14:49,821 --> 00:14:54,159
You do realize this entitles you
to extra-special bonus sex.

226
00:14:54,868 --> 00:14:57,245
What is extra-special bonus sex?

227
00:14:57,787 --> 00:15:00,457
It's whatever you want it to be.

228
00:15:01,624 --> 00:15:03,918
That sounds like fun.

229
00:15:05,753 --> 00:15:07,255
Go away.

230
00:15:07,964 --> 00:15:11,759
Okay, I'll just play Scrabble
till you're ready.

231
00:15:13,386 --> 00:15:15,013
Give me a sec.

232
00:15:19,934 --> 00:15:21,853
Please don't tell me Francine is here.

233
00:15:22,729 --> 00:15:24,147
Okay.

234
00:15:24,314 --> 00:15:26,065
Wait, wait, wait.

235
00:15:26,232 --> 00:15:27,275
Francine is here?

236
00:15:27,442 --> 00:15:29,611
- Yeah, you want me to cover for you?
- Yes.

237
00:15:29,777 --> 00:15:31,070
I'm on it.

238
00:15:31,237 --> 00:15:34,240
Wait. Charlie, I'm begging you.

239
00:15:34,407 --> 00:15:35,700
No more jewelry.

240
00:15:35,867 --> 00:15:38,870
Don't worry. It's not funny twice.

241
00:15:44,292 --> 00:15:45,919
Sorry, he must have gone out.

242
00:15:46,419 --> 00:15:49,380
Oh, okay. Tell him I stopped by.

243
00:15:51,674 --> 00:15:54,010
Francine, wait.

244
00:15:54,177 --> 00:15:55,261
I can't do this.

245
00:15:55,929 --> 00:15:56,971
Do what?

246
00:15:57,555 --> 00:15:59,390
I'm not a good liar.

247
00:16:00,975 --> 00:16:03,561
I know where he is,
I'm just not supposed to tell you.

248
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:07,857
The thing is, Alan does
a lot of charity work.

249
00:16:08,650 --> 00:16:10,276
- Really?
- Oh, yeah.

250
00:16:12,070 --> 00:16:14,072
Right now he's down
at the nursing home...

251
00:16:14,238 --> 00:16:16,449
giving sponge baths to old people.

252
00:16:18,242 --> 00:16:21,871
They don't go out a lot
so they tend to get dusty.

253
00:16:22,538 --> 00:16:23,581
I had no idea.

254
00:16:24,415 --> 00:16:27,543
In fact, just the other night
he was down on skid row...

255
00:16:27,710 --> 00:16:30,922
teaching salsa dancing
to crack addicts.

256
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:33,216
Oh, my goodness.

257
00:16:33,383 --> 00:16:36,260
They have the energy,
they just lack the focus.

258
00:16:38,262 --> 00:16:41,891
But I think— I think what he's
proudest of is his work with the kids.

259
00:16:43,184 --> 00:16:45,812
He takes runaways forced to live
on the streets...

260
00:16:45,979 --> 00:16:48,272
and teaches them how to live
in the woods.

261
00:16:50,149 --> 00:16:55,655
I don't really see the point but those
little urchins seem to thrive in the wild.

262
00:16:55,822 --> 00:16:57,990
It's like he's a saint.

263
00:16:58,157 --> 00:17:01,119
You must be so proud to have him
as your brother.

264
00:17:01,661 --> 00:17:04,622
Well, truth be told,
he does bring me a lot of joy.

265
00:17:06,582 --> 00:17:08,584
Thank you for telling me this, Charlie.

266
00:17:08,751 --> 00:17:10,920
You're welcome.

267
00:17:11,087 --> 00:17:13,589
Just promise you won't
embarrass him bringing it up.

268
00:17:13,756 --> 00:17:18,052
Not a word.
I just hope I can be worthy of him.

269
00:17:20,471 --> 00:17:23,766
And the plot moistens.

270
00:17:27,437 --> 00:17:31,858
Oh, that's terrific, buddy.
I am so proud of you.

271
00:17:32,024 --> 00:17:34,110
Yeah, sure, I'll tell him.

272
00:17:34,277 --> 00:17:37,363
Oh, all right. Love you. Bye-bye.

273
00:17:37,530 --> 00:17:38,698
Guess what.

274
00:17:38,865 --> 00:17:41,909
Jake just got the lead
in the school musical.

275
00:17:42,076 --> 00:17:43,661
The lead?

276
00:17:43,828 --> 00:17:46,914
What happened, did every other kid
in school get mono?

277
00:17:47,582 --> 00:17:49,333
No, I think it was Francine.

278
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:52,378
I think she cast Jake
because of our relationship.

279
00:17:52,545 --> 00:17:56,716
You mean it's gotten physical?
You're sleeping his way to the top?

280
00:17:57,216 --> 00:18:00,386
No, no.
Nothing happened between us.

281
00:18:00,553 --> 00:18:03,931
- But I think she's fallen for me.
- Really?

282
00:18:04,098 --> 00:18:05,600
What makes you think that?

283
00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:09,770
Well, I had lunch with her today
and she was looking at me with...

284
00:18:09,937 --> 00:18:11,647
I don't know...

285
00:18:11,814 --> 00:18:14,233
worship in her eyes.

286
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,152
Like I was some kind of—

287
00:18:16,611 --> 00:18:18,571
- Saint?
- Yes, yes.

288
00:18:19,572 --> 00:18:20,615
How did you know?

289
00:18:21,574 --> 00:18:23,451
That's how I think of you.

290
00:18:23,618 --> 00:18:26,370
Very funny. I've been
doing my best not to lead her on...

291
00:18:26,537 --> 00:18:31,000
but I guess I just underestimated
my allure.

292
00:18:32,001 --> 00:18:33,044
Say that again.

293
00:18:33,961 --> 00:18:35,838
- What?
- That last part.

294
00:18:36,005 --> 00:18:38,174
You mean,
I underestimated my allure?

295
00:18:40,968 --> 00:18:42,970
Yeah, that's it.

296
00:18:43,971 --> 00:18:45,890
I'm sorry, am I missing something?

297
00:18:46,641 --> 00:18:48,309
No, not a thing.

298
00:18:49,268 --> 00:18:51,729
Well, good.

299
00:18:51,896 --> 00:18:54,398
You see, Alan. That's how you lie.

300
00:19:04,450 --> 00:19:06,702
Pretty exciting, huh? Opening night.

301
00:19:07,161 --> 00:19:10,790
Well, having seen the previews,
I'm betting closing night too.

302
00:19:11,415 --> 00:19:13,417
Boy, this brings back memories.

303
00:19:13,584 --> 00:19:16,963
Sixth grade was the happiest
two years of my life.

304
00:19:22,802 --> 00:19:24,262
It's the finger.

305
00:19:24,887 --> 00:19:27,014
Excuse me.

306
00:19:29,517 --> 00:19:31,811
So, Kandi, what's your
favorite musical?

307
00:19:31,978 --> 00:19:33,771
The trombone.

308
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:39,402
I can't believe you brought her here.

309
00:19:39,568 --> 00:19:41,362
I had to, Jake invited her.

310
00:19:42,530 --> 00:19:45,783
Is that a diamond necklace?
You never gave me a diamond necklace.

311
00:19:45,950 --> 00:19:49,745
Y eah, well, you never gave me
extra-special bonus sex.

312
00:19:49,912 --> 00:19:51,288
- Hi, Charlie.
- Hi.

313
00:19:51,455 --> 00:19:53,666
- Who's this?
- This? Oh, this is Kandi.

314
00:19:53,833 --> 00:19:55,334
Hi, I'm with Alan.

315
00:19:57,044 --> 00:19:59,922
Are you one of those young people
he takes care of?

316
00:20:00,089 --> 00:20:04,301
Yep, yep, yep. Good old Saint Alan.
Just can't do enough for the kids.

317
00:20:04,468 --> 00:20:06,679
Look at this diamond necklace
he gave me.

318
00:20:07,596 --> 00:20:09,598
He gave you a diamond necklace?

319
00:20:09,765 --> 00:20:13,978
Don't get the wrong idea,
it wasn't to get me to have sex.

320
00:20:14,437 --> 00:20:17,523
I was already doing
everything he wanted.

321
00:20:19,859 --> 00:20:22,653
I am as shocked as you are.

322
00:21:04,111 --> 00:21:05,613
What was that about?

323
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:08,824
Funny story. I'll tell you later.
