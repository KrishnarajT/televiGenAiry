1
00:00:04,150 --> 00:00:05,192
You're up early.

2
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:07,987
Well, it's a beautiful day,
shame to waste it sleeping.

3
00:00:08,154 --> 00:00:10,781
- Must've got to bed early then.
- I guess.

4
00:00:10,948 --> 00:00:13,117
Well, you know what they say.

5
00:00:13,284 --> 00:00:18,164
Early to bed, early to rise, makes a man
healthy, wealthy and can't get laid, huh?

6
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:20,666
Maybe I'm not trying.

7
00:00:20,833 --> 00:00:24,003
Y eah. And look for me next month
on the cover of Maxim.

8
00:00:25,463 --> 00:00:28,090
I'll have nothing on but the vacuum.

9
00:00:29,842 --> 00:00:33,345
- Hey, you're up early.
- Y es, Alan, I'm up early.

10
00:00:33,512 --> 00:00:37,183
I went to bed early and I slept alone.
Anything else you wanna know?

11
00:00:37,558 --> 00:00:39,602
Was I this cranky
when I wasn't having sex?

12
00:00:40,144 --> 00:00:42,521
No,
you were more of a sullen whiner.

13
00:00:43,689 --> 00:00:47,318
- Okay, Huggy Bear, I gotta go.
- Oh, all right, Kandi, have a good day.

14
00:00:47,485 --> 00:00:49,862
Yo, Daisy Mae.

15
00:00:50,446 --> 00:00:54,033
Just out of curiosity, when you
leave here, where is it you go?

16
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:58,537
T o the gym. I have to take care
of my body because it's my instrument.

17
00:00:59,371 --> 00:01:01,415
Mine too.

18
00:01:01,582 --> 00:01:05,419
Three beers and a bratwurst
and my ass turns into a French horn.

19
00:01:07,504 --> 00:01:11,175
Really? Whenever I have beer
and bratwurst I just fart a lot.

20
00:01:12,718 --> 00:01:15,471
Okay. Okay, Kandi, well,
I'll see you tonight.

21
00:01:15,638 --> 00:01:17,139
Bye, everybody.

22
00:01:17,306 --> 00:01:18,349
Congratulations, Alan.

23
00:01:18,515 --> 00:01:21,602
It looks like you've officially
boinked her brains out.

24
00:01:23,145 --> 00:01:25,522
Okay, so she's not
overly sophisticated.

25
00:01:25,689 --> 00:01:29,401
Sophisticated? She's two marbles
rolling around in a tin can.

26
00:01:29,568 --> 00:01:33,489
Hey, hey, she's got a great heart,
she's warm and loving.

27
00:01:33,656 --> 00:01:37,326
- And she genuinely cares for me.
- I stand corrected.

28
00:01:37,493 --> 00:01:39,328
One marble.

29
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:44,208
Look, buddy, I'm happy
you finally found an instrument to play...

30
00:01:44,375 --> 00:01:46,919
that isn't in your own pants.

31
00:01:47,628 --> 00:01:49,672
But she's been spending
a lot of time here.

32
00:01:49,838 --> 00:01:52,299
If you're not careful,
she's gonna wanna move in.

33
00:01:53,133 --> 00:01:54,426
Would that be so bad?

34
00:01:55,302 --> 00:01:57,638
Hey, I don't have a lot of rules
around here...

35
00:01:57,805 --> 00:02:00,766
but nine of the top ten
are just different ways of saying:

36
00:02:00,933 --> 00:02:03,268
"Women are not allowed
to live here. "

37
00:02:03,435 --> 00:02:05,187
They come and they go.

38
00:02:05,354 --> 00:02:09,483
Often they do one of those multiple
times, but in the end they always go.

39
00:02:09,692 --> 00:02:11,902
But why is that so important?

40
00:02:12,069 --> 00:02:16,323
Alan, there's a natural balance
in this house, which must not be upset.

41
00:02:16,490 --> 00:02:18,200
It's like the Amazon rain forest.

42
00:02:18,367 --> 00:02:20,411
You bring in one too many
spider monkeys...

43
00:02:20,577 --> 00:02:22,705
you're up to your ass in tree frogs.

44
00:02:22,913 --> 00:02:25,624
Oh tree frogs.
That clears up everything.

45
00:02:25,791 --> 00:02:28,669
Don't patronize me,
you hump-happy simpleton.

46
00:02:28,836 --> 00:02:31,213
- You know what I'm saying.
- I do.

47
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:34,842
If Kandi were to move in here,
it would be an environmental disaster...

48
00:02:35,008 --> 00:02:36,844
- ... of epic proportions.
- Exactly.

49
00:02:37,010 --> 00:02:40,389
She's been living here
the past three weeks.

50
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:44,393
- What?
- Who's the simpleton now?

51
00:02:45,144 --> 00:02:48,772
Kandi got evicted from her apartment
three weeks ago and she moved in here.

52
00:02:48,939 --> 00:02:52,609
Oh, please, if a woman was living
in my own house for that long...

53
00:02:52,776 --> 00:02:54,278
I think I'd notice.

54
00:02:54,445 --> 00:02:58,699
Oh, really? Really?
Well, let's try a little experiment.

55
00:02:58,866 --> 00:03:01,243
What color is the couch
in the living room?

56
00:03:02,953 --> 00:03:06,707
- The couch?
- No peeking. What color is it?

57
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:11,044
Well, it's kind of a—

58
00:03:11,211 --> 00:03:14,298
Beige-ish—

59
00:03:18,552 --> 00:03:20,053
Tan.

60
00:03:20,596 --> 00:03:22,598
- You sure?
- Yeah, I'm sure.

61
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:26,560
- Go look.
- Fine.

62
00:03:32,441 --> 00:03:34,693
What the hell is that?

63
00:03:35,027 --> 00:03:36,069
Your couch.

64
00:03:36,236 --> 00:03:38,405
Jake spilled grape juice on it
last summer.

65
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:39,907
I had it reupholstered.

66
00:03:40,073 --> 00:03:42,784
- Last summer?
- Yeah, it was gone almost a month.

67
00:03:42,951 --> 00:03:45,704
Berta and I bet
on how long it would take you to notice.

68
00:03:45,871 --> 00:03:48,582
I had 50 bucks on never.

69
00:03:48,749 --> 00:03:51,460
All right, all right this is unacceptable.

70
00:03:51,627 --> 00:03:55,172
This is my house and if furniture's
gonna get reupholstered or moved...

71
00:03:55,339 --> 00:03:58,675
or changed in any way whatsoever,
I demand to be consulted.

72
00:03:58,842 --> 00:04:01,678
- Okay, from now on. I promise.
- Thank you.

73
00:04:04,264 --> 00:04:06,683
I bought the damn thing.

74
00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:10,896
Think I'd have a vote,
maybe show me a swatch.

75
00:04:13,982 --> 00:04:17,986
Hey, wait a minute,
did somebody say Kandi's living here?

76
00:04:46,223 --> 00:04:47,724
Boy, am I thirsty.

77
00:04:47,891 --> 00:04:50,519
That's because you sweat so much
during sex.

78
00:04:51,311 --> 00:04:53,480
I may not have the biggest boat
in the marina.

79
00:04:53,647 --> 00:04:56,024
But nobody rows harder than me.

80
00:04:57,567 --> 00:04:58,777
You have a boat?

81
00:04:59,987 --> 00:05:02,281
- No, sweetie, what I meant was—
- Hey, hey, hey.

82
00:05:02,447 --> 00:05:05,701
Some of us don't wanna hear
about your little dinghy.

83
00:05:06,785 --> 00:05:09,663
- Oh, hi, Charlie.
- What're you doing here?

84
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:11,623
I was asking myself the same thing...

85
00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:15,460
so I did a little research
and it turns out it's my house.

86
00:05:16,753 --> 00:05:18,630
Yeah, but I thought
you were going out.

87
00:05:18,797 --> 00:05:22,134
- I did go out. And then I came back.
- Alone?

88
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:25,053
No, Alan, I brought home
an invisible cocktail waitress.

89
00:05:26,513 --> 00:05:28,348
She's doing me even as we speak.

90
00:05:29,891 --> 00:05:32,728
You're right. There's no way
you could've been that cranky.

91
00:05:34,312 --> 00:05:35,814
You want some company, Charlie?

92
00:05:35,981 --> 00:05:38,358
Alan can't have sex again
for at least 30 minutes.

93
00:05:41,778 --> 00:05:44,281
That's a rough estimate.

94
00:05:44,448 --> 00:05:46,783
Thanks, but I'd really rather be alone.

95
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:50,746
Okey-doke. Come on,
I think he wants to masturbate.

96
00:05:56,334 --> 00:05:58,920
Not for at least 30 minutes.

97
00:06:06,762 --> 00:06:10,265
Okay, I haven't sampled anything
from the other side of the buffet...

98
00:06:10,432 --> 00:06:12,976
since I traveled
with the Grateful Dead.

99
00:06:13,143 --> 00:06:15,771
But golly Moses, she's a muffin.

100
00:06:18,273 --> 00:06:19,983
Interesting turn of events, huh?

101
00:06:20,776 --> 00:06:23,028
Your brother hitting
one of your hand-me-downs.

102
00:06:23,195 --> 00:06:26,990
And you couldn't get laid if you
painted your penis to look like money.

103
00:06:28,033 --> 00:06:29,951
Don't think I haven't tried.

104
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:33,789
I'm reminded of the tale
of the tortoise and the hare.

105
00:06:33,955 --> 00:06:36,041
Isn't there something
you could be doing?

106
00:06:36,583 --> 00:06:40,420
Well, I could go rub some oil on her,
but I don't trust myself.

107
00:06:42,255 --> 00:06:44,424
Berta, please don't take this
the wrong way...

108
00:06:44,591 --> 00:06:48,803
but it's been a long time for me
and you're starting to turn me on.

109
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:51,723
I'm out of here.

110
00:06:54,267 --> 00:06:57,020
- Hi, Berta.
- Hey, baby.

111
00:06:57,604 --> 00:07:00,148
- Hi, Charlie.
- Hi.

112
00:07:00,524 --> 00:07:04,611
- Boy, this is weird, huh?
- ln so many ways.

113
00:07:04,819 --> 00:07:06,655
But which one caught your attention?

114
00:07:07,197 --> 00:07:09,533
Well, I've never slept
with brothers before.

115
00:07:09,699 --> 00:07:11,576
I mean at different times.

116
00:07:11,743 --> 00:07:14,996
And one can't help
but make comparisons.

117
00:07:15,622 --> 00:07:17,249
No kidding.

118
00:07:17,415 --> 00:07:21,002
So how big a difference
are we talking about?

119
00:07:21,169 --> 00:07:23,630
It's huge.

120
00:07:24,256 --> 00:07:26,466
- Really?
- Oh, yeah.

121
00:07:26,633 --> 00:07:29,219
With you, sex is kind of
like going on Space Mountain.

122
00:07:29,386 --> 00:07:32,764
It's a good ride,
but there's never any real danger.

123
00:07:33,390 --> 00:07:36,059
With Alan, it's like being
in the back seat of a car...

124
00:07:36,226 --> 00:07:39,479
driven by a really smart kangaroo.

125
00:07:41,731 --> 00:07:46,027
He may go up on the curb
a couple times, but he'll get you there.

126
00:07:47,779 --> 00:07:49,447
Okay.

127
00:07:49,614 --> 00:07:51,783
Thanks for clearing that up.

128
00:07:53,159 --> 00:07:54,911
I'll get it.

129
00:07:56,871 --> 00:08:00,292
There's a two hour wait
for Space Mountain.

130
00:08:02,752 --> 00:08:05,588
- Hi, Mrs. Harper.
- Oh, dear lord.

131
00:08:05,755 --> 00:08:07,590
Hey, Kandi,
I got Evil Dead 3 for Xbox.

132
00:08:07,757 --> 00:08:09,217
Sweet.

133
00:08:09,384 --> 00:08:12,429
Kandi, maybe you'd like to go
put some clothes on.

134
00:08:12,595 --> 00:08:16,099
- Why?
- Yeah, she ain't hurting anybody.

135
00:08:18,476 --> 00:08:21,646
I just don't think that outfit
is appropriate for Jake.

136
00:08:21,813 --> 00:08:26,192
Oh, I agree.
He would look ridiculous in this.

137
00:08:27,193 --> 00:08:28,486
Can you get Alan for me?

138
00:08:28,653 --> 00:08:30,864
- He's not back from work yet.
- He's not?

139
00:08:31,031 --> 00:08:34,909
- Then what are you doing here?
- I live here now. Didn't Alan tell you?

140
00:08:35,076 --> 00:08:37,120
No, he did not.

141
00:08:37,287 --> 00:08:40,373
- Charlie, I wanna talk to you.
- Good to know.

142
00:08:40,540 --> 00:08:42,083
Charlie, get over here.

143
00:08:45,045 --> 00:08:47,297
It was nice seeing you, Mrs. Harper.

144
00:08:50,258 --> 00:08:52,093
What in God's name
does she see in him?

145
00:08:52,594 --> 00:08:56,389
Well, I don't have all the details,
Mrs. Harper.

146
00:08:56,556 --> 00:08:58,892
But apparently
when he's not being emasculated...

147
00:08:59,059 --> 00:09:01,978
and demoralized on a daily basis,
he's quite the lover.

148
00:09:02,145 --> 00:09:04,856
- What's that supposed to mean?
- You know what they say.

149
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:07,025
Your average man's
like a good field mule.

150
00:09:07,192 --> 00:09:09,903
If you don't beat him,
he'll keep plowing all day long.

151
00:09:10,111 --> 00:09:13,990
- Nobody says that.
- You're hard to fool.

152
00:09:15,658 --> 00:09:18,703
Look, I don't mean to be rude,
but I'm tired of talking to you.

153
00:09:27,754 --> 00:09:30,006
Had an interesting chat
with your ex-wife.

154
00:09:30,173 --> 00:09:32,592
Oh, can't we just have a nice dinner?

155
00:09:32,801 --> 00:09:36,262
- I like her.
- Why?

156
00:09:37,347 --> 00:09:38,932
Why?

157
00:09:40,308 --> 00:09:42,352
Well, unlike most ex-wives
I've known...

158
00:09:42,519 --> 00:09:45,563
she's never tried to run me over
with her car.

159
00:09:47,357 --> 00:09:49,984
Okay, new dinner conversation.

160
00:09:50,151 --> 00:09:51,486
Jake, how was school?

161
00:09:51,653 --> 00:09:54,948
I don't think this conversation'll
make you any happier, Dad.

162
00:09:56,491 --> 00:09:59,327
- What now?
- We had a surprise test today.

163
00:09:59,828 --> 00:10:03,206
- And?
- I was really surprised.

164
00:10:03,414 --> 00:10:05,375
So, in other words,
you weren't prepared.

165
00:10:05,542 --> 00:10:08,086
You can't prepare for a surprise, Dad.

166
00:10:09,254 --> 00:10:11,047
New conversation?

167
00:10:11,381 --> 00:10:14,717
Jake, what are we gonna do?
You've really fallen behind this year.

168
00:10:14,884 --> 00:10:18,304
I know. I think it's a delayed reaction
to your divorce.

169
00:10:19,889 --> 00:10:21,224
- Oh?
- Yeah.

170
00:10:21,391 --> 00:10:25,395
It took a while, but my teachers have
finally stopped feeling sorry for me.

171
00:10:25,812 --> 00:10:28,314
You know, I'm a child of divorce too,
Jake.

172
00:10:28,481 --> 00:10:31,150
Really? How old were you
when your parents split up?

173
00:10:31,317 --> 00:10:33,903
- Twenty-two.
- But you're 22 now.

174
00:10:34,070 --> 00:10:35,947
Twenty-two and a half.

175
00:10:36,114 --> 00:10:38,783
Boy, what I'd give to be 22 again.

176
00:10:41,953 --> 00:10:42,996
New subject?

177
00:10:43,162 --> 00:10:47,417
No, no, no more conversation. Jake,
if you're finished, go do your homework.

178
00:10:47,584 --> 00:10:48,751
I'm gonna need help.

179
00:10:48,918 --> 00:10:51,754
- You don't need help, you need to focus.
- I'll help you.

180
00:10:51,921 --> 00:10:53,673
Do you know anything
about geometry?

181
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:58,094
Well, I know it's what you say
when you turn into a tree.

182
00:10:58,261 --> 00:11:01,180
Get it? Gee, I'm a tree.

183
00:11:02,557 --> 00:11:03,683
Good one.

184
00:11:04,267 --> 00:11:05,810
Thanks.

185
00:11:06,311 --> 00:11:10,898
Boy, I hope when they get to Oz
the wizard has two brains to give out.

186
00:11:11,441 --> 00:11:13,693
And speaking of out,
when's Kandi leaving?

187
00:11:14,152 --> 00:11:16,321
- You don't have to worry.
- Because?

188
00:11:16,487 --> 00:11:18,072
I have a plan.

189
00:11:18,614 --> 00:11:20,658
Alan, if history has taught
us anything...

190
00:11:20,825 --> 00:11:23,703
it's that both those statements
cannot be true.

191
00:11:24,579 --> 00:11:27,415
It's very simple.
You give a man a fish, he eats for a day.

192
00:11:27,582 --> 00:11:29,667
You teach him to fish,
he eats forever.

193
00:11:29,834 --> 00:11:33,629
Okay, okay, in that example
is Kandi the man or the fish?

194
00:11:34,547 --> 00:11:35,715
I found her a job.

195
00:11:35,882 --> 00:11:39,719
She'll be able to afford her own place
and she won't depend on me anymore.

196
00:11:39,886 --> 00:11:41,137
Where is she working?

197
00:11:41,763 --> 00:11:45,141
- She's gonna be my receptionist.
- That's your plan?

198
00:11:45,308 --> 00:11:49,520
Why it's brilliant.

199
00:11:50,271 --> 00:11:52,523
What, what?
She's attractive, she's friendly...

200
00:11:52,690 --> 00:11:55,318
and she's more than capable
of answering the phones.

201
00:11:55,485 --> 00:11:58,029
You hear the expression
"don't crap where you eat"?

202
00:11:58,196 --> 00:12:02,158
Well, you, my friend, are dropping
plunkies all over the dessert cart.

203
00:12:03,993 --> 00:12:06,245
- Okay, you have a better solution?
- No, no, no.

204
00:12:06,412 --> 00:12:08,748
No, it's your girlfriend,
your office, your life.

205
00:12:08,915 --> 00:12:11,000
Screw it up however you think best.

206
00:12:12,627 --> 00:12:15,755
I'll get it. I'm expecting a call.

207
00:12:16,964 --> 00:12:18,508
Hello?

208
00:12:22,386 --> 00:12:24,806
Kandi, that's the TV remote.

209
00:12:29,352 --> 00:12:31,270
Hello?

210
00:12:32,730 --> 00:12:34,273
Hello?

211
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:37,235
Have you thought of teaching
a fish to answer your phones?

212
00:12:40,279 --> 00:12:41,739
Hello?

213
00:12:46,952 --> 00:12:48,620
- Staying in tonight?
- Y ep.

214
00:12:48,787 --> 00:12:50,456
- Giving up on the ladies, huh?
- Y ep.

215
00:12:50,622 --> 00:12:53,000
- Not even gonna try?
- Nope.

216
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:55,502
You know, I got a niece in the joint.

217
00:12:55,669 --> 00:12:59,089
She doesn't look like much,
but she does get conjugal visits.

218
00:13:00,257 --> 00:13:01,300
I don't think so.

219
00:13:01,467 --> 00:13:05,054
Hold on, I might have a copy
of her mug shot. Here.

220
00:13:05,429 --> 00:13:06,930
She looks a little wall-eyed...

221
00:13:07,097 --> 00:13:10,851
but that's because they had to
use a Taser to get her out of the shed.

222
00:13:11,685 --> 00:13:14,688
- The shed?
- She was running a meth lab.

223
00:13:14,855 --> 00:13:17,399
But you gotta admit,
she is nice and slender.

224
00:13:19,610 --> 00:13:22,613
- Thanks, but pass.
- Think about it.

225
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:24,823
Visiting days
are Wednesdays and Fridays.

226
00:13:24,990 --> 00:13:27,618
But if you decide to go,
be a sport, take her a pie.

227
00:13:29,203 --> 00:13:31,372
- Right.
- Make it something chewy.

228
00:13:31,538 --> 00:13:35,417
The prison dentist set her up
with some real nice teeth.

229
00:13:52,893 --> 00:13:54,269
Okay.

230
00:13:54,436 --> 00:13:56,730
Now this isn't my lamp.

231
00:13:59,274 --> 00:14:01,193
What happened to my lamp?

232
00:14:03,070 --> 00:14:05,364
Unless this is my lamp.

233
00:14:06,448 --> 00:14:08,117
Yeah, this is my lamp.

234
00:14:08,283 --> 00:14:11,245
I bought this lamp to go
with my couch.

235
00:14:12,371 --> 00:14:15,249
My tan couch.

236
00:14:16,125 --> 00:14:17,417
Worst day of my life.

237
00:14:17,584 --> 00:14:19,711
Yeah, well, it was no picnic
for me either.

238
00:14:19,878 --> 00:14:22,756
- I don't know who you are anymore.
- You wanna know who I am?

239
00:14:22,923 --> 00:14:26,677
I'm the idiot paying you $10 an hour to
miss phone calls. Nap in the bathroom.

240
00:14:26,844 --> 00:14:28,720
Use my x-ray machine
on Mexican food.

241
00:14:28,887 --> 00:14:31,849
Well, I wanted to know
what's inside a chimichanga.

242
00:14:32,015 --> 00:14:34,434
If you didn't know,
why'd you order it?

243
00:14:34,601 --> 00:14:36,436
Because it's fun to say chimichanga.

244
00:14:38,105 --> 00:14:41,567
Chimichanga. See?

245
00:14:41,733 --> 00:14:44,987
So, how was work?

246
00:14:45,153 --> 00:14:47,364
Horrible.
All he did was boss me around:

247
00:14:47,531 --> 00:14:50,492
"Do this, do that, wake up. "

248
00:14:51,535 --> 00:14:53,912
Maybe that's because I'm your boss.

249
00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:56,373
A stupid, stinky boss.

250
00:14:57,791 --> 00:15:00,085
Anybody wanna know
about my problems?

251
00:15:01,587 --> 00:15:03,672
It was supposed
to be Sloppy Joes for lunch.

252
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:06,258
But instead they had fish sticks.

253
00:15:08,218 --> 00:15:09,761
Well, it ruined my day.

254
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:15,309
No, no, no, I'll get it.
That's what I do.

255
00:15:15,475 --> 00:15:17,936
That's all I'm good for.

256
00:15:18,103 --> 00:15:21,106
Hello? Oh, fudge.

257
00:15:21,273 --> 00:15:24,901
Picture an entire day of this.

258
00:15:25,193 --> 00:15:28,322
With six lines.

259
00:15:29,448 --> 00:15:30,616
Hello?

260
00:15:30,782 --> 00:15:32,868
Oh, hi, Mrs. Harper.

261
00:15:33,035 --> 00:15:35,662
Oh, great. Kandi, Kandi,
give me the phone, give me—

262
00:15:35,829 --> 00:15:37,331
Back off buck-o.

263
00:15:38,165 --> 00:15:41,877
Was your ex-husband
always such a control freak?

264
00:15:42,044 --> 00:15:44,212
She says you were.

265
00:15:44,630 --> 00:15:45,964
You know what he did today?

266
00:15:46,131 --> 00:15:48,467
Kandi, you don't have
to get into that with her.

267
00:15:48,634 --> 00:15:51,303
She says she wants to know.

268
00:15:53,430 --> 00:15:57,351
Well, first of all at the office he tried
to make me call him Dr. Harper all day.

269
00:15:57,517 --> 00:16:00,479
And when I forgot he yelled at me.

270
00:16:00,687 --> 00:16:01,980
What?

271
00:16:02,147 --> 00:16:04,232
Chiropractors aren't really doctors.

272
00:16:07,152 --> 00:16:09,279
You liar.

273
00:16:11,490 --> 00:16:13,617
I so get why you dumped him.

274
00:16:14,493 --> 00:16:16,244
- Hey, Alan?
- What?

275
00:16:16,411 --> 00:16:18,789
Is this a new lamp?

276
00:16:18,997 --> 00:16:22,417
I would like that so much,
Mrs. Harper.

277
00:16:22,584 --> 00:16:26,171
Okay, I will call you Judith.
Great, I'll see you there.

278
00:16:27,589 --> 00:16:28,882
See her where?

279
00:16:29,049 --> 00:16:31,510
We're going out for a drink
and a little girl talk.

280
00:16:31,676 --> 00:16:33,345
Girl talk with my ex-wife?

281
00:16:33,512 --> 00:16:37,307
Her name is Judith,
Mr. "I'm not a doctor" Harper.

282
00:16:39,184 --> 00:16:40,769
Don't wait up.

283
00:16:42,938 --> 00:16:45,941
You just crapped
where you used to eat.

284
00:16:55,742 --> 00:16:57,452
- Hey.
- Hey.

285
00:16:57,619 --> 00:16:59,955
- What are you doing up so late?
- What time is it?

286
00:17:00,622 --> 00:17:01,748
It's 3 a.m.

287
00:17:02,249 --> 00:17:05,168
Oh, well then, I got my eight hours.

288
00:17:07,087 --> 00:17:09,381
What are you doing,
waiting up for Kandi?

289
00:17:09,548 --> 00:17:11,258
Oh, no, no, no. I couldn't sleep.

290
00:17:11,424 --> 00:17:13,760
So I thought I'd read a little.

291
00:17:14,970 --> 00:17:16,346
A furniture catalog?

292
00:17:18,682 --> 00:17:20,016
I like furniture.

293
00:17:21,476 --> 00:17:24,813
- Just looking at the pictures, huh?
- What are you getting at, Charlie?

294
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:26,356
I think you buy things.

295
00:17:28,441 --> 00:17:32,070
I think you bought this lamp.

296
00:17:32,237 --> 00:17:35,365
- That lamp was here when I moved in.
- Oh, really?

297
00:17:35,532 --> 00:17:39,494
Charlie, I'm afraid that this dry streak
is starting to affect your mind.

298
00:17:43,248 --> 00:17:45,292
Maybe you're right.

299
00:17:45,458 --> 00:17:48,253
Sure, this is my lamp.
I've had it for years.

300
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:51,715
- The table it's on is new.
- I knew it.

301
00:17:54,634 --> 00:17:56,678
We don't wanna wake up
Mr. Alan Hitler.

302
00:17:56,845 --> 00:17:59,097
No, no, Osama bin Alan.

303
00:18:03,226 --> 00:18:06,396
- Busted.
- What the hell is going on here?

304
00:18:06,605 --> 00:18:08,315
The hell what is going on here...

305
00:18:08,481 --> 00:18:11,443
is that I need an advance
on my "amilony. "

306
00:18:12,611 --> 00:18:16,156
- Why?
- T o pay Estefan, our limo driver.

307
00:18:16,323 --> 00:18:17,824
You took a limo?

308
00:18:17,991 --> 00:18:19,326
We couldn't find our cars...

309
00:18:19,492 --> 00:18:23,622
and we spent all our money
on JELL-O shots, and chimichangas.

310
00:18:25,916 --> 00:18:27,292
All right, all right.

311
00:18:27,459 --> 00:18:30,462
Kandi, you need to go to bed.
We have to get up early for work.

312
00:18:30,629 --> 00:18:32,881
No, we don't. Because I quit.

313
00:18:33,089 --> 00:18:35,258
Why don't we talk
about this in the morning?

314
00:18:36,343 --> 00:18:38,970
All right, Judith,
here is you're "amilony. "

315
00:18:39,721 --> 00:18:41,681
- Thank you.
- Go home.

316
00:18:41,848 --> 00:18:43,099
And Kandi, go to bed.

317
00:18:44,017 --> 00:18:46,311
I do not wish to live with you
any furthermore.

318
00:18:46,770 --> 00:18:48,229
- What?
- I have been invited...

319
00:18:48,396 --> 00:18:51,441
to stay with my good friend Judith.

320
00:18:51,650 --> 00:18:53,777
Come on, I'll help you
pack your things.

321
00:18:53,943 --> 00:18:56,655
Did you ever notice how much
he sweats during sex?

322
00:19:01,368 --> 00:19:03,036
Well, good for you.

323
00:19:03,203 --> 00:19:05,205
Good for me?
How is this good for me?

324
00:19:05,372 --> 00:19:08,291
- You got Kandi out of the house.
- I didn't want Kandi out.

325
00:19:08,458 --> 00:19:10,794
And I didn't want her
moving in with my ex-wife.

326
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:13,380
Oh, right.

327
00:19:14,089 --> 00:19:17,842
Okay then, good for me.

328
00:19:32,190 --> 00:19:34,526
- Harper?
- Here.

329
00:19:36,611 --> 00:19:38,238
I'm gonna have to check your pie.

330
00:19:38,822 --> 00:19:39,989
Rhubarb.

331
00:19:40,156 --> 00:19:42,742
Oh, my girls like rhubarb.

332
00:19:46,538 --> 00:19:51,126
Okay, inmate 37059.
Down the hall, third door on the left.

333
00:19:51,292 --> 00:19:54,629
There's a button by the bed.
Push it if she gets violent.

334
00:19:55,463 --> 00:19:57,090
Thank you.

335
00:20:01,219 --> 00:20:04,222
- lt won't open.
- Try it again.

336
00:20:07,684 --> 00:20:11,521
Boy, you really are
having a dry streak, aren't you?

337
00:20:13,731 --> 00:20:15,608
Oh, God.

338
00:20:16,776 --> 00:20:19,195
I can't even get laid
in a women's prison.

339
00:20:27,829 --> 00:20:31,332
- Hi, are you Alan?
- No, I'm his brother, Charlie.

340
00:20:31,499 --> 00:20:33,585
Oh, well, I'm looking for Kandi.

341
00:20:33,918 --> 00:20:35,420
She told me she was living here.

342
00:20:35,587 --> 00:20:39,632
Actually, she moved.
It's a very funny story.

343
00:20:39,799 --> 00:20:42,177
- Are you a friend?
- I'm her mother.

344
00:20:44,429 --> 00:20:47,599
Come on in and I'll see if I can find
a forwarding address.

345
00:20:48,725 --> 00:20:49,976
Thank you.

346
00:20:50,727 --> 00:20:53,188
Chimichanga.

347
00:20:54,063 --> 00:20:57,025
- Beautiful place.
- Thank you.

348
00:20:58,318 --> 00:21:00,361
I see where Kandi
gets her good looks.

349
00:21:00,528 --> 00:21:04,616
Thanks, unfortunately she gets
her brains from her moron father.

350
00:21:04,824 --> 00:21:08,912
Oh, right, you're recently divorced.
Would you like a drink?

351
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:11,831
I would love one.

352
00:21:13,374 --> 00:21:19,047
Great. Why don't you step out
on to the deck, and I'll be right there.

353
00:21:21,674 --> 00:21:24,135
Good news,
it's raining out on my deck.

354
00:21:24,302 --> 00:21:25,970
Say what?

355
00:21:26,137 --> 00:21:28,139
The dry streak is over.

356
00:21:28,723 --> 00:21:31,643
So, what am I supposed to do
with this pie?

357
