1
00:00:03,719 --> 00:00:05,930
- Hey.
- Hey.

2
00:00:07,014 --> 00:00:09,684
So, what's going on in school?

3
00:00:09,850 --> 00:00:11,477
Nothing.

4
00:00:13,437 --> 00:00:16,691
Nothing? You just sit there all day
and stare at the wall?

5
00:00:16,857 --> 00:00:19,235
That's where the clock is.

6
00:00:23,572 --> 00:00:25,449
I got it.

7
00:00:26,409 --> 00:00:30,454
Well, I find it hard to believe
that you just watch the clock all day.

8
00:00:30,621 --> 00:00:33,249
Have you seen my report card?

9
00:00:36,377 --> 00:00:37,545
Jake, it's for you.

10
00:00:37,712 --> 00:00:39,422
- I'm busy.
- It's a girl.

11
00:00:39,588 --> 00:00:41,340
I don't care.

12
00:00:41,549 --> 00:00:42,967
Her name is Wendy Cho.

13
00:00:43,134 --> 00:00:46,053
Hold on, I'm coming.
Don't hang up.

14
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:49,390
Hey. How's it going?

15
00:00:49,598 --> 00:00:52,184
Okay, that's something
we haven't seen before.

16
00:00:52,351 --> 00:00:56,147
Yeah, he only moves that fast
when he's got the squirts.

17
00:00:58,482 --> 00:01:01,569
Wendy Cho is the smartest girl.
I wonder why she's calling Jake.

18
00:01:01,736 --> 00:01:03,779
Maybe she lost a bet.

19
00:01:04,447 --> 00:01:06,073
Charlie, that's not nice.

20
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,993
Well, kids are cruel.

21
00:01:09,744 --> 00:01:10,911
Jake is smitten with her.

22
00:01:11,078 --> 00:01:13,873
I hope he's not setting himself up
for disappointment.

23
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:15,374
Hey, you know what they say.

24
00:01:15,541 --> 00:01:19,545
A man's reach must exceed his grasp,
or what's a penis for?

25
00:01:21,297 --> 00:01:22,423
Who says that?

26
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:24,300
Okay, I might be paraphrasing.

27
00:01:33,309 --> 00:01:34,852
Okay, call you back. Bye.

28
00:01:41,150 --> 00:01:42,985
- Hey, Dad?
- Yeah, Jake?

29
00:01:43,194 --> 00:01:45,738
Wendy Cho is having
a party tomorrow night, can I go?

30
00:01:45,905 --> 00:01:48,324
T omorrow?
A little last minute, isn't it?

31
00:01:48,491 --> 00:01:50,326
Well, she wasn't gonna invite me.

32
00:01:50,493 --> 00:01:52,870
Danny Palmer told Amy Sherlack
I didn't like her.

33
00:01:53,037 --> 00:01:56,499
But I told Peter Calahan
to tell Ellen Meisner that I kind of did.

34
00:01:58,584 --> 00:02:00,461
I see.

35
00:02:01,212 --> 00:02:03,047
You do?

36
00:02:05,049 --> 00:02:07,968
He lost me at Amy Sherlack.

37
00:02:08,636 --> 00:02:11,263
- Are her parents gonna be there?
- I guess.

38
00:02:11,472 --> 00:02:15,476
Let the fathers
who have girls worry about that.

39
00:02:16,936 --> 00:02:18,562
Shut up.

40
00:02:18,813 --> 00:02:20,898
All right, I'm gonna wanna meet
her parents.

41
00:02:21,065 --> 00:02:23,067
I don't see any reason
why you can't go.

42
00:02:23,234 --> 00:02:26,904
Cool. Oh, yeah, I'm gonna need
a new shirt, new pants and new shoes.

43
00:02:27,071 --> 00:02:28,989
What's wrong with the clothes
you've got?

44
00:02:29,156 --> 00:02:32,034
Are you kidding?
Everybody's already seen them.

45
00:02:32,201 --> 00:02:35,788
Y eah, but not
with all the latest food stains.

46
00:02:36,121 --> 00:02:38,040
I hear gravy's the new black.

47
00:02:40,376 --> 00:02:42,002
Fine, we'll go shopping tomorrow.

48
00:02:42,545 --> 00:02:43,712
How about a new haircut?

49
00:02:43,879 --> 00:02:45,214
What's wrong with my hair?

50
00:02:45,422 --> 00:02:48,801
Let's just say
everybody's already seen it.

51
00:02:49,009 --> 00:02:50,553
Okay, a new haircut.

52
00:02:52,555 --> 00:02:55,140
So this is your first party
with girls, huh?

53
00:02:55,891 --> 00:02:57,268
Maybe.

54
00:02:57,434 --> 00:02:59,478
Maybe? You're not sure?

55
00:02:59,645 --> 00:03:02,648
You got some cross-dressers
in sixth grade?

56
00:03:04,733 --> 00:03:07,861
Playing a little pin the tail
on the tranny?

57
00:03:09,196 --> 00:03:10,864
Shut up.

58
00:03:12,074 --> 00:03:14,326
Why does everyone
keep telling me to shut up?

59
00:03:14,493 --> 00:03:16,787
Because you' re an insensitive dolt.

60
00:03:16,954 --> 00:03:18,831
That's no reason.

61
00:03:19,039 --> 00:03:21,292
This is a very delicate time
in a boy's life.

62
00:03:21,458 --> 00:03:24,295
I remember how nervous I was
about my first boy-girl party.

63
00:03:24,461 --> 00:03:27,256
Oh, right.
That was in college, wasn't it?

64
00:03:28,465 --> 00:03:30,301
Shut up.

65
00:03:31,093 --> 00:03:33,262
What's important now
is that we support Jake.

66
00:03:33,429 --> 00:03:34,805
Agreed.

67
00:03:34,972 --> 00:03:37,016
I'll kick in the wine coolers
and condoms.

68
00:03:37,182 --> 00:03:38,976
What are you gonna do?

69
00:03:40,269 --> 00:03:41,437
You're joking, right?

70
00:03:44,148 --> 00:03:45,774
Okay, let's say I'm joking.

71
00:03:47,484 --> 00:03:50,571
I appreciate your interest,
but this is a father-son moment.

72
00:03:50,738 --> 00:03:52,406
I've been looking forward to it...

73
00:03:52,573 --> 00:03:56,160
since I saw the shadow of his little
dingus in the first sonogram.

74
00:03:57,661 --> 00:03:59,663
That's very touching.

75
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:01,874
And more than a bit creepy.

76
00:04:02,041 --> 00:04:05,252
But still, I can't risk letting
you scar the kid forever.

77
00:04:05,794 --> 00:04:07,921
- What do you mean by that?
- Face it, Alan.

78
00:04:08,088 --> 00:04:09,757
What can you bring to the table...

79
00:04:09,923 --> 00:04:12,468
other than a lifetime
of abject failure with women?

80
00:04:13,385 --> 00:04:15,721
It's not a lifetime yet.

81
00:04:15,929 --> 00:04:19,141
I, on the other hand,
have a wealth of experience to offer.

82
00:04:19,349 --> 00:04:23,187
He's 12. He doesn't need to know
how to choreograph a three-way.

83
00:04:23,353 --> 00:04:25,564
I'm not talking about that.

84
00:04:25,731 --> 00:04:27,441
I'm saving that for prom night.

85
00:04:29,026 --> 00:04:30,569
Oh, good.

86
00:04:30,736 --> 00:04:32,154
Let me give you an example.

87
00:04:32,321 --> 00:04:34,907
Jake's at the party.
All the boys are on one side...

88
00:04:35,074 --> 00:04:37,618
all the girls are on the other.
What's he do?

89
00:04:38,410 --> 00:04:39,912
You see? You see? Right there.

90
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:44,208
That "um" is the battle cry
of the chronic masturbator.

91
00:04:50,506 --> 00:04:52,466
Define chronic.

92
00:04:53,509 --> 00:04:57,262
The solution to the problem,
my hairy-palmed friend...

93
00:04:58,555 --> 00:05:01,642
is to walk up to the prettiest girl
and ask her to dance.

94
00:05:01,809 --> 00:05:02,851
Why the prettiest?

95
00:05:03,018 --> 00:05:05,312
She's the one
all the other guys are afraid of.

96
00:05:05,479 --> 00:05:07,147
She'll be dying for some attention.

97
00:05:07,356 --> 00:05:09,650
What if Wendy Cho
isn't the prettiest girl?

98
00:05:09,817 --> 00:05:10,859
It doesn't matter.

99
00:05:11,026 --> 00:05:14,988
When she sees our boy dancing with
a hot chick, she'll be all over him.

100
00:05:17,741 --> 00:05:20,410
Of course, it's so obvious.

101
00:05:20,619 --> 00:05:24,289
Bet you're wishing you could
do over sixth grade now, huh?

102
00:05:25,457 --> 00:05:28,293
- I could've danced with Heidi Winkler.
- Yeah, you could've.

103
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:30,671
- Or Pam Talega.
- Yep.

104
00:05:30,838 --> 00:05:32,047
Or Mary Beth Hicks.

105
00:05:32,214 --> 00:05:34,383
Shoshana Wasserstein.

106
00:05:35,259 --> 00:05:37,052
I don't think so.

107
00:05:40,889 --> 00:05:42,850
Hey, can I get leather pants?

108
00:05:43,016 --> 00:05:44,601
- No.
- No.

109
00:05:44,768 --> 00:05:45,936
Why not?

110
00:05:46,103 --> 00:05:48,730
Because you need something
that lets the farts out.

111
00:05:53,986 --> 00:05:55,571
So...

112
00:05:55,737 --> 00:05:57,447
Wendy Cho, huh?

113
00:05:57,614 --> 00:05:59,449
Real subtle, Alan.

114
00:05:59,658 --> 00:06:01,910
Charlie, it's a father-son thing.

115
00:06:02,077 --> 00:06:04,621
Yeah, so was pre-war lraq.

116
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:08,750
You wanna tell me about her?

117
00:06:08,917 --> 00:06:10,335
Not really.

118
00:06:10,502 --> 00:06:11,962
Is she in your class?

119
00:06:12,170 --> 00:06:15,716
Where else would I meet her?
At a bar?

120
00:06:16,925 --> 00:06:18,635
- My turn?
- No.

121
00:06:18,802 --> 00:06:21,888
I'm just curious
about what kind of person she is.

122
00:06:22,055 --> 00:06:26,643
What it is about her that you find,
I don't know, alluring.

123
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:28,353
What?

124
00:06:29,187 --> 00:06:31,398
Your dad wants to know
if you think she's hot.

125
00:06:33,066 --> 00:06:34,651
It's personal.

126
00:06:34,818 --> 00:06:36,862
She's hot.

127
00:06:37,487 --> 00:06:39,114
Are you nervous about this party?

128
00:06:39,948 --> 00:06:42,075
I don't know. Maybe a little.

129
00:06:42,242 --> 00:06:44,202
- Okay, here's what you do.
- Charlie.

130
00:06:44,369 --> 00:06:47,456
Hey, hey, you had your shot.
"Alluring. "

131
00:06:49,833 --> 00:06:51,918
- ls there gonna be dancing?
- I think so.

132
00:06:52,085 --> 00:06:53,879
Terrific. Do you know how to dance?

133
00:06:54,046 --> 00:06:55,505
Not exactly.

134
00:06:55,672 --> 00:06:57,174
Don't worry, it's easy to fake.

135
00:06:57,341 --> 00:06:58,508
The thing to remember is...

136
00:06:58,675 --> 00:07:01,219
the more you move your arms,
the stupider you look.

137
00:07:01,595 --> 00:07:03,680
Oh, that is so not true.

138
00:07:03,847 --> 00:07:06,475
- Just keep it simple and you'll be fine.
- Okay.

139
00:07:06,641 --> 00:07:09,353
Besides, the critical time
is between dances.

140
00:07:09,519 --> 00:07:10,604
What do you mean?

141
00:07:10,771 --> 00:07:13,815
That's when you talk.
More precisely, you get her to talk.

142
00:07:13,982 --> 00:07:15,650
- About what?
- Doesn't matter.

143
00:07:15,817 --> 00:07:18,570
- You won't be listening anyway.
- Oh, Charlie.

144
00:07:18,737 --> 00:07:20,197
Just drive the car.

145
00:07:20,364 --> 00:07:22,657
Yeah, Dad, this is important.

146
00:07:22,824 --> 00:07:24,868
Keep in mind,
you're not looking to score.

147
00:07:25,035 --> 00:07:28,830
- You're getting into the batter's box.
- Wendy doesn't like sports.

148
00:07:30,207 --> 00:07:31,583
You're missing the point.

149
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:32,959
She plays violin.

150
00:07:35,379 --> 00:07:36,838
Listen to me.

151
00:07:37,005 --> 00:07:38,757
Your goal for the party tonight...

152
00:07:38,924 --> 00:07:41,843
is to convince Wendy
you're a mature, sophisticated guy...

153
00:07:42,010 --> 00:07:44,930
who sees her not just as a woman
but as a complete human.

154
00:07:45,097 --> 00:07:46,139
Got it?

155
00:07:46,306 --> 00:07:47,641
- I think so.
- Good.

156
00:07:48,433 --> 00:07:50,227
I'm not going.

157
00:07:51,853 --> 00:07:53,730
Hey, hey, not only are you
gonna go...

158
00:07:53,897 --> 00:07:56,858
it'll be a night you'll remember
for the rest of your life.

159
00:07:57,025 --> 00:07:58,944
That's what I'm afraid of.

160
00:08:04,825 --> 00:08:07,327
Oh, oh, this is nice.

161
00:08:07,494 --> 00:08:10,956
Yeah, sure, if he's doing
the other kids' taxes.

162
00:08:11,623 --> 00:08:13,166
It's a timeless style.

163
00:08:13,333 --> 00:08:16,461
No, it just seems timeless
when you're not getting laid.

164
00:08:17,671 --> 00:08:19,005
Put it back.

165
00:08:19,172 --> 00:08:20,674
This is cool.

166
00:08:20,841 --> 00:08:22,175
Yeah. Just one question.

167
00:08:22,342 --> 00:08:24,886
Is your Wendy Cho
a voodoo priestess?

168
00:08:26,179 --> 00:08:28,723
No, I think she's Chinese.

169
00:08:28,932 --> 00:08:30,934
Put it back.

170
00:08:31,309 --> 00:08:34,563
There's something to be said for
letting him make his own choices.

171
00:08:34,729 --> 00:08:36,731
Oh, that's a bunch of crap.
He's an idiot.

172
00:08:38,692 --> 00:08:42,153
If we let him, he'd go to that party
in a Viking helmet and a cape.

173
00:08:45,198 --> 00:08:46,575
Here we go.

174
00:08:49,578 --> 00:08:51,413
Don't even think about it.

175
00:08:51,621 --> 00:08:55,458
What? It says, "I've got a little money,
but I'm not a corporate drone. "

176
00:08:55,625 --> 00:08:58,920
No, it says, "I'm pushing 40
and I can't deal with it. "

177
00:09:01,923 --> 00:09:04,426
All right, maybe the kid needs
his own look.

178
00:09:04,634 --> 00:09:05,927
Jake, come here.

179
00:09:06,136 --> 00:09:08,096
- What?
- Just stand there.

180
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:11,516
Let's try and visualize
what your personal style might be.

181
00:09:11,725 --> 00:09:13,768
Okay.

182
00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:23,069
Maybe we should start
with the haircut.

183
00:09:26,281 --> 00:09:29,951
Oh, my, has Mommy been trimming
your hair with her teeth?

184
00:09:30,118 --> 00:09:34,331
Not to worry, Ricky loves a challenge.

185
00:09:34,497 --> 00:09:39,127
I'm guessing Ricky also
loves pretending he's a taffy apple.

186
00:09:39,628 --> 00:09:42,005
Wanna take him to your guy
with the shaky hands...

187
00:09:42,172 --> 00:09:43,965
and a signed picture
of Desi Arnaz?

188
00:09:44,132 --> 00:09:46,134
Desi Arnaz had beautiful hair.

189
00:09:46,301 --> 00:09:49,721
So, Charles, do we have a game plan
or shall I just follow my muse?

190
00:09:49,888 --> 00:09:52,849
- Can I get a Mohawk?
- No.

191
00:09:53,016 --> 00:09:55,101
We should go
for something young and hip.

192
00:09:55,268 --> 00:09:57,354
- Like your hairstyle?
- Sure, why not?

193
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:59,481
You'd have to kill me.

194
00:10:00,273 --> 00:10:02,442
Just tighten it up a little.
Nothing extreme.

195
00:10:02,609 --> 00:10:05,111
- Can you make it purple?
- No.

196
00:10:05,278 --> 00:10:06,321
Oh, man.

197
00:10:06,488 --> 00:10:09,949
Relax. Ricky knows what he's doing.
He's been cutting my hair for years.

198
00:10:10,116 --> 00:10:11,868
What if I don't wanna look like you?

199
00:10:12,577 --> 00:10:14,829
- What's wrong with the way I look?
- Nothing.

200
00:10:14,996 --> 00:10:17,499
If you're a statue in front
of a Big Boy restaurant.

201
00:10:18,875 --> 00:10:21,169
- Are you freaking kidding me?
- Charlie.

202
00:10:21,878 --> 00:10:25,131
- The kid should be so lucky.
- We'll wait over here.

203
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:29,219
I'm buying the little wise-ass a $75
haircut and he's taking shots at me?

204
00:10:29,386 --> 00:10:31,554
You said it,
he has to find his own look.

205
00:10:31,721 --> 00:10:34,391
Yeah, let him find it
on somebody else's MasterCard.

206
00:10:34,557 --> 00:10:37,060
- Look at his point of view.
- What's his point of view?

207
00:10:37,227 --> 00:10:40,980
Well, put overalls on you and you do
kind of look like the Big Boy.

208
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:43,983
Stand like this for me.

209
00:10:46,069 --> 00:10:47,612
Shut up.

210
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:52,700
By the way,
did you have the talk with him?

211
00:10:52,867 --> 00:10:55,745
Oh, sure.
I mean, well, we've had a talk.

212
00:10:55,912 --> 00:10:58,873
Covered the basics.
He knows where babies come from.

213
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:01,126
- How they got there.
- That's all?

214
00:11:01,292 --> 00:11:03,002
He's going to this party clueless...

215
00:11:03,169 --> 00:11:05,505
about how much fun he can have
between "Hi"...

216
00:11:05,672 --> 00:11:08,049
and "What do you mean,
you missed your period? "

217
00:11:08,216 --> 00:11:10,969
It's a kids' party.
Pizza, soft drinks, a little dancing.

218
00:11:11,136 --> 00:11:13,555
Oh, really? You know
what I was doing at his age?

219
00:11:13,721 --> 00:11:15,598
- I don't wanna hear it.
- You sure?

220
00:11:15,765 --> 00:11:17,767
It involves Shoshana Wasserstein.

221
00:11:19,018 --> 00:11:20,937
You danced
with Shoshana Wasserstein?

222
00:11:21,104 --> 00:11:23,231
Actually, that's one thing
we didn't do.

223
00:11:25,191 --> 00:11:27,527
Nevertheless, I'm Jake's father.

224
00:11:27,694 --> 00:11:30,405
I believe childhood
should be a time of innocence.

225
00:11:30,572 --> 00:11:33,116
I agree. Childhood should be
a time of innocence.

226
00:11:33,283 --> 00:11:35,118
And Bambi's mother shouldn't die.

227
00:11:35,285 --> 00:11:38,788
Lap dances should be complimentary
after the fifth cocktail.

228
00:11:39,622 --> 00:11:42,125
But that's not the world we live in.

229
00:11:42,292 --> 00:11:44,544
This party tonight
is the initial round...

230
00:11:44,711 --> 00:11:47,297
in a lifelong process
of sexual elimination.

231
00:11:47,463 --> 00:11:50,383
- Oh, really?
- Think of it as musical chairs.

232
00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:53,219
But when the music stops,
the guys who have a clue...

233
00:11:53,386 --> 00:11:56,389
are sitting on a woman
instead of a chair.

234
00:11:57,223 --> 00:12:01,144
The guys who have no clue,
they'll spend their teenage years—

235
00:12:01,311 --> 00:12:05,106
Well, I certainly don't need
to tell Dungeon Master Alan.

236
00:12:10,361 --> 00:12:12,864
Come on, Jake,
we're gonna be late for the party.

237
00:12:14,365 --> 00:12:16,034
I'm ready.

238
00:12:18,119 --> 00:12:20,371
- It's very nice.
- Yeah, I think we're good.

239
00:12:20,538 --> 00:12:22,206
Turn around.

240
00:12:24,876 --> 00:12:27,337
You're supposed to take
the price tag off.

241
00:12:27,503 --> 00:12:31,090
But you said it was good
to be seen in expensive clothes.

242
00:12:31,299 --> 00:12:34,260
You still want him
to learn from his mistakes?

243
00:12:34,427 --> 00:12:35,553
Fine. Can we go now?

244
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:36,763
Hang on.

245
00:12:36,930 --> 00:12:38,598
Let's see the dance moves.

246
00:12:44,395 --> 00:12:47,523
Don't stare at your shoes,
eyes on the girl at all times.

247
00:12:47,690 --> 00:12:50,109
Pretend you care.

248
00:12:51,986 --> 00:12:53,321
Good. Good. Good. Now...

249
00:12:53,488 --> 00:12:56,616
how do you stand when you know
Wendy's looking at you?

250
00:12:58,785 --> 00:13:02,038
That's it. A little head bob.

251
00:13:03,414 --> 00:13:05,124
Show me the sleepy eyes.

252
00:13:08,211 --> 00:13:10,088
I said sleepy, not brain-dead.

253
00:13:13,174 --> 00:13:14,217
All right.

254
00:13:14,926 --> 00:13:17,720
- Who's the man? Who's the man?
- I'm the man. I'm the man.

255
00:13:17,887 --> 00:13:19,347
Okay, let's go get them.

256
00:13:29,732 --> 00:13:32,235
- Alan.
- I'm coming.

257
00:13:33,403 --> 00:13:35,822
2138...

258
00:13:35,988 --> 00:13:37,907
2136...

259
00:13:38,074 --> 00:13:40,910
Try the house with the balloons
tied to the mailbox.

260
00:13:41,119 --> 00:13:43,454
Oh, right.

261
00:13:45,206 --> 00:13:48,042
Okay, let's go.

262
00:13:48,251 --> 00:13:50,753
Where are you going?

263
00:13:51,629 --> 00:13:54,841
I wanna meet her parents, say hello,
find out when to pick you up.

264
00:13:55,007 --> 00:13:56,968
Alan, you take one step out this car...

265
00:13:57,135 --> 00:13:59,846
I will beat your brains out
with a tire iron.

266
00:14:00,555 --> 00:14:02,432
Thank you, Uncle Charlie.

267
00:14:03,975 --> 00:14:05,143
Have fun.

268
00:14:05,309 --> 00:14:07,520
Call my cell when you want me
to pick you—

269
00:14:07,687 --> 00:14:09,397
Up.

270
00:14:11,732 --> 00:14:13,443
There he goes.

271
00:14:13,609 --> 00:14:17,655
My son is attending
his first boy-girl party.

272
00:14:23,578 --> 00:14:25,079
Who's that opening the door?

273
00:14:25,246 --> 00:14:27,456
Oh, oh, that's Wendy Cho.

274
00:14:27,623 --> 00:14:30,042
Oh, good, she's cute.
The kid's got taste.

275
00:14:30,209 --> 00:14:32,086
But she's like a foot taller than him.

276
00:14:32,253 --> 00:14:33,296
That's all right.

277
00:14:33,462 --> 00:14:36,299
When they slow dance,
his head will be perfectly positioned.

278
00:14:36,465 --> 00:14:38,384
Oh, get your mind out of the gutter.

279
00:14:38,593 --> 00:14:41,721
Right, like you never copped
a feel with your ear?

280
00:14:41,888 --> 00:14:43,723
No.

281
00:14:44,891 --> 00:14:47,268
Okay, once with Aunt Sophie.

282
00:14:48,019 --> 00:14:49,729
But that was an accident.

283
00:14:49,937 --> 00:14:51,439
You know what I'm talking about.

284
00:14:51,606 --> 00:14:53,566
Oh, yeah.

285
00:14:56,527 --> 00:14:57,987
Here you go.

286
00:14:58,154 --> 00:14:59,864
Thank you.

287
00:15:00,489 --> 00:15:02,533
Oh, looks good.

288
00:15:03,826 --> 00:15:05,828
She's pretty, huh?

289
00:15:07,371 --> 00:15:08,623
Yeah, I guess.

290
00:15:09,332 --> 00:15:10,958
What's the matter with you?

291
00:15:11,125 --> 00:15:13,711
What if I sent him out there
too soon?

292
00:15:13,878 --> 00:15:15,129
What if he's not ready?

293
00:15:15,296 --> 00:15:17,673
Don't beat yourself,
you did everything you could.

294
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:21,302
There just wasn't enough time,
damn it.

295
00:15:21,469 --> 00:15:24,055
It's out of our hands.
We let nature take its course.

296
00:15:24,221 --> 00:15:29,101
Sounds good, unfortunately nature
keeps telling him to scratch his ass.

297
00:15:31,395 --> 00:15:33,856
- It's Jake.
- God, I knew it. Give me that.

298
00:15:34,023 --> 00:15:35,816
No, no, no, I got it.

299
00:15:35,983 --> 00:15:37,276
Hey, what's up, buddy?

300
00:15:38,027 --> 00:15:39,236
He wants to come home.

301
00:15:39,403 --> 00:15:40,738
Why? He just got there.

302
00:15:40,905 --> 00:15:42,949
Why? You just got there.

303
00:15:43,908 --> 00:15:45,534
He says it's personal.

304
00:15:46,077 --> 00:15:47,620
Give me that.

305
00:15:47,787 --> 00:15:51,666
Jake, Jake, I'm gonna
talk you through this.

306
00:15:51,874 --> 00:15:54,669
Just pipe down and listen.

307
00:15:54,835 --> 00:15:57,380
Finish your cookie later.

308
00:15:59,173 --> 00:16:02,134
Where's Wendy Cho right now?

309
00:16:02,426 --> 00:16:04,387
How many girls is she talking to?

310
00:16:04,553 --> 00:16:07,473
Okay, okay,
you gotta split her from the herd.

311
00:16:09,266 --> 00:16:11,686
Walk over and say
you have something to ask her.

312
00:16:11,852 --> 00:16:15,481
Then take her hand
and lead her away from her friends.

313
00:16:16,148 --> 00:16:18,317
Okay, then put the cookie down first.

314
00:16:20,695 --> 00:16:24,532
Now, when you have some privacy,
I want you to look her in the eye...

315
00:16:24,699 --> 00:16:28,619
and say you were lying.
You just wanted to be alone with her.

316
00:16:29,078 --> 00:16:31,455
It will too work.

317
00:16:31,622 --> 00:16:33,874
All right, call me back.

318
00:16:35,042 --> 00:16:37,169
God, I just wish I could be there
with him.

319
00:16:37,336 --> 00:16:39,505
- Me too.
- Thanks.

320
00:16:41,924 --> 00:16:43,676
Ready for a refill?

321
00:16:43,843 --> 00:16:45,553
Sure.

322
00:16:46,178 --> 00:16:47,847
Are you okay?

323
00:16:48,013 --> 00:16:50,933
Yeah, I'm fine.
I'm just worried about my nephew.

324
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:52,935
He's at his first boy-girl party.

325
00:16:53,102 --> 00:16:55,354
Oh, that's adorable.

326
00:16:55,521 --> 00:16:56,981
He's my son.

327
00:17:01,026 --> 00:17:03,404
- How old is he?
- Twelve.

328
00:17:03,571 --> 00:17:05,322
Kid's the apple of my eye.

329
00:17:06,490 --> 00:17:07,741
You're so sweet.

330
00:17:07,908 --> 00:17:11,745
Excuse me, officially,
it's my apple and my eye.

331
00:17:13,205 --> 00:17:14,665
Okay.

332
00:17:16,584 --> 00:17:17,668
Connie.

333
00:17:17,835 --> 00:17:20,796
- Charlie.
- Would you like some pie, Charlie?

334
00:17:20,963 --> 00:17:22,298
It's on the house.

335
00:17:22,465 --> 00:17:24,508
Your house or mine?

336
00:17:24,675 --> 00:17:27,386
You're awful. Mine.

337
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:30,431
Un-freaking-believable.

338
00:17:32,683 --> 00:17:35,811
Look, Connie, I'm kind of tied up
tonight with my nephew.

339
00:17:35,978 --> 00:17:37,897
Why not write your number
on the bill?

340
00:17:38,522 --> 00:17:40,357
Already did.

341
00:17:44,528 --> 00:17:45,905
What?

342
00:17:46,447 --> 00:17:49,366
- He's my son.
- But I know how to use him.

343
00:17:53,537 --> 00:17:54,705
Oh, it's Jake.

344
00:18:01,253 --> 00:18:02,838
Talk to me.

345
00:18:03,005 --> 00:18:04,673
No, you're the man.

346
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:06,091
You're the man.

347
00:18:06,717 --> 00:18:08,219
Great. Keep me posted.

348
00:18:08,427 --> 00:18:09,637
Who's the man?

349
00:18:09,803 --> 00:18:11,263
Right.

350
00:18:15,142 --> 00:18:16,602
What? What?

351
00:18:17,937 --> 00:18:19,939
It's going well.

352
00:18:24,485 --> 00:18:28,155
He's gonna be one of the last
to leave. That's a good sign.

353
00:18:28,614 --> 00:18:29,782
Yeah.

354
00:18:29,949 --> 00:18:33,619
You tend to lose track of time
when you're in a closet with a girl.

355
00:18:35,204 --> 00:18:37,539
I just wish I could've
covered kissing with him.

356
00:18:37,706 --> 00:18:40,834
Please, God, don't let him pucker.

357
00:18:42,962 --> 00:18:45,214
- What's wrong?
- Oh, it's nothing.

358
00:18:45,381 --> 00:18:47,633
Don't worry, Wendy will know
what to do.

359
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:50,344
She's probably been practicing
with her girlfriends.

360
00:18:50,511 --> 00:18:53,263
Man, chicks are so lucky.

361
00:18:53,472 --> 00:18:57,601
It's not the kissing.
It's this whole thing.

362
00:18:57,768 --> 00:19:00,521
I'm sorry if I interfered
with the father-son deal, but—

363
00:19:00,688 --> 00:19:03,107
No, no, no,
you've done a great job.

364
00:19:03,273 --> 00:19:05,109
Jake's really lucky to have you.

365
00:19:05,317 --> 00:19:06,443
So, what's the problem?

366
00:19:08,988 --> 00:19:10,656
I guess I'm a little jealous.

367
00:19:10,864 --> 00:19:12,866
- Of what?
- Charlie...

368
00:19:13,033 --> 00:19:15,452
do you have any idea
what it would've meant...

369
00:19:15,619 --> 00:19:18,831
to have you take me under your wing
the way you have with Jake?

370
00:19:18,998 --> 00:19:21,000
Oh, here we go.

371
00:19:21,166 --> 00:19:23,168
Dad was gone, there was no one
to teach me.

372
00:19:23,335 --> 00:19:25,629
You know how I found out
about French kissing?

373
00:19:25,796 --> 00:19:28,632
Mom sliced a plum in half
and stuck her tongue in it.

374
00:19:29,508 --> 00:19:32,636
You could have taken
that secret to the grave.

375
00:19:32,803 --> 00:19:34,471
And that's not all she showed me.

376
00:19:34,638 --> 00:19:38,267
T o this day, I can't eat plums,
dried apricots or bananas.

377
00:19:39,518 --> 00:19:42,020
All right, all right, I'm sorry.

378
00:19:43,439 --> 00:19:48,736
Look, I was young, I was selfish,
I should have been there for you.

379
00:19:50,154 --> 00:19:52,990
You know, it's not too late.

380
00:19:54,158 --> 00:19:56,577
That's a real nice idea, buddy.

381
00:19:56,744 --> 00:19:58,579
But I'm afraid it is.

382
00:20:00,581 --> 00:20:02,833
- Hey.
- Hey.

383
00:20:04,710 --> 00:20:06,420
Well, how'd it go?

384
00:20:06,587 --> 00:20:07,671
Okay.

385
00:20:07,838 --> 00:20:11,133
- Just okay?
- Alan, leave it alone.

386
00:20:11,341 --> 00:20:13,218
All right.

387
00:20:14,136 --> 00:20:17,181
- So, Jake, congratulations.
- For what?

388
00:20:17,347 --> 00:20:19,433
You got lipstick all over your mouth.

389
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:20,642
Oh, man.

390
00:20:20,809 --> 00:20:23,228
Relax, I was bluffing.

391
00:20:25,063 --> 00:20:27,816
But congratulations.

392
00:20:27,983 --> 00:20:29,902
Thanks.

393
00:20:35,925 --> 00:20:38,302
Well, it was touch-and-go there
for a while.

394
00:20:38,469 --> 00:20:41,097
But I think Jake's off
to a good start with the ladies.

395
00:20:41,263 --> 00:20:42,890
Yeah, listen, Charlie.

396
00:20:43,057 --> 00:20:45,559
Don't take this the wrong way...

397
00:20:45,726 --> 00:20:50,231
but I really don't want Jake
to grow up like you.

398
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:54,276
Alan, how could I possibly
take that the wrong way?

399
00:20:54,485 --> 00:20:57,404
No, I mean,
I don't want him to be a player.

400
00:20:57,571 --> 00:21:01,200
I want him to value women and
cherish his relationships with them.

401
00:21:01,367 --> 00:21:05,913
Hey, I value women,
I cherish my relationships with them.

402
00:21:06,330 --> 00:21:08,582
But I take your point.

403
00:21:11,335 --> 00:21:13,796
Hey, Dad, how old
do you have to be to get married?

404
00:21:13,963 --> 00:21:16,215
I guess 18. Why?

405
00:21:16,382 --> 00:21:18,968
Just wondering how long
Wendy and I have to wait.

406
00:21:20,594 --> 00:21:22,638
One kiss
and he's ready to marry the girl.

407
00:21:23,889 --> 00:21:25,057
So?

408
00:21:25,224 --> 00:21:28,102
So you don't have to worry.
He's definitely your son.
