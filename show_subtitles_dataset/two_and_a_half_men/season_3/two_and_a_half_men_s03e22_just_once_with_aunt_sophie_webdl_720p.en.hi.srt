1
00:00:02,470 --> 00:00:03,888
- Morning.
- Morning.

2
00:00:04,388 --> 00:00:06,140
Yeah, what's up?

3
00:00:09,768 --> 00:00:11,395
Oh, stop it.

4
00:00:11,812 --> 00:00:14,815
- Hey. Give me back my skully.
- This is not a skully.

5
00:00:14,982 --> 00:00:17,610
It's a ski cap your grandmother
gave you for Christmas.

6
00:00:17,818 --> 00:00:21,030
- Charlie, he's just trying to find his look.
- Word.

7
00:00:21,655 --> 00:00:23,365
Word?

8
00:00:23,574 --> 00:00:26,827
There's a reindeer on it.

9
00:00:27,578 --> 00:00:30,498
Don't listen to him, Jake.
I think it looks very dope on you.

10
00:00:31,707 --> 00:00:33,209
Oh, man.

11
00:00:35,252 --> 00:00:38,964
Oh, hey, did you see that your former
girlfriend's dance troupe is in town?

12
00:00:39,131 --> 00:00:42,718
Mia's here? Let me see that.
Come on, come on, come on.

13
00:00:42,927 --> 00:00:44,887
Whoa, is somebody
still carrying a torch?

14
00:00:45,054 --> 00:00:46,889
T orch? Don't be ridiculous.

15
00:00:47,056 --> 00:00:50,726
I mean, I'm glad to see she's following
her dream but I've moved on.

16
00:00:51,393 --> 00:00:53,854
- I think she called the other day.
- What? When?

17
00:00:55,105 --> 00:00:57,066
What did she want?
What did she say?

18
00:00:57,274 --> 00:00:59,318
Come on, kid, spill it.

19
00:00:59,526 --> 00:01:01,946
Nope, no unresolved feelings there.

20
00:01:02,404 --> 00:01:04,657
She wanted to talk to you
but you weren't home.

21
00:01:04,823 --> 00:01:09,036
I know that, you chowderhead.
What else did she say?

22
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:12,122
She said, "What's new? "
I said, "Nothing much. "

23
00:01:12,289 --> 00:01:14,833
And then she said, "How's school? "
I said, "lt sucks. "

24
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,420
Then she said, "That's too bad. "
I said, "Yeah. "

25
00:01:19,129 --> 00:01:22,675
I'm gonna kill him, Alan.
I swear to God I'm gonna kill him.

26
00:01:23,050 --> 00:01:26,262
Oh, yeah, she wants us
to come see her dance next weekend.

27
00:01:26,553 --> 00:01:28,639
It says she's performing this weekend.

28
00:01:28,806 --> 00:01:31,392
Oh, I guess she called last weekend.

29
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,936
- You're telling me this now?
- Charlie. Calm down.

30
00:01:34,103 --> 00:01:36,230
How many things
does the kid have to handle?

31
00:01:36,397 --> 00:01:38,357
Eat, poop, tell me who called.

32
00:01:39,942 --> 00:01:42,903
She said some guy named Will
has tickets.

33
00:01:45,531 --> 00:01:48,784
- Who's Will?
- I don't know. She said he'd call.

34
00:01:49,576 --> 00:01:51,120
Will's gonna call?

35
00:01:51,286 --> 00:01:55,165
- You mean the tickets are at will call?
- I don't know. Maybe.

36
00:01:55,374 --> 00:01:58,627
Dear God, he's a doorstop that eats.

37
00:02:00,212 --> 00:02:03,882
Do me a favor. From now on,
when somebody calls, write it down.

38
00:02:04,049 --> 00:02:05,676
- I did.
- Where?

39
00:02:05,843 --> 00:02:08,345
- On my homework.
- Okay, where's your homework?

40
00:02:09,555 --> 00:02:12,975
Oh yeah, my teacher called.
She wants to meet with you.

41
00:02:13,267 --> 00:02:14,810
When?

42
00:02:14,977 --> 00:02:16,895
Oh, I guess it was last week.

43
00:02:19,398 --> 00:02:21,442
Peace out.

44
00:02:30,826 --> 00:02:32,494
Great. Great. Thank you.

45
00:02:32,661 --> 00:02:36,457
Mia left us four seats for Friday night.
House seats, center orchestra.

46
00:02:37,958 --> 00:02:41,670
What do you think? You, me, Jake, Kandi,
go out to dinner, make an evening of it?

47
00:02:41,837 --> 00:02:42,963
Sounds like fun.

48
00:02:43,172 --> 00:02:47,509
Maybe afterwards you could tie me to an
anthill, and smear honey on my genitals.

49
00:02:48,218 --> 00:02:49,303
So you don't wanna go?

50
00:02:49,803 --> 00:02:52,931
Jeez, now I see where
the kid gets his brains.

51
00:02:53,474 --> 00:02:56,059
No, I don't wanna go.
Why would I wanna go?

52
00:02:56,226 --> 00:02:58,103
Because you were in love
with the woman...

53
00:02:58,270 --> 00:03:00,856
and still have feelings for her
and wanna see her.

54
00:03:01,023 --> 00:03:03,692
Oh, that's crazy.
God, you are so naive.

55
00:03:03,859 --> 00:03:07,154
- How am I naive?
- Oh, oh, I know this one.

56
00:03:10,491 --> 00:03:14,244
Alan, when an ex-girlfriend calls,
no good can come from it.

57
00:03:14,411 --> 00:03:16,955
Unless, you know,
it's 2 a.m., she's blind drunk...

58
00:03:17,122 --> 00:03:20,417
and wants to get even
with her new cheating boyfriend.

59
00:03:20,626 --> 00:03:23,003
She just wanted to invite us
to the ballet.

60
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:26,048
Yeah, right.
And girls are completely unaware...

61
00:03:26,215 --> 00:03:28,842
that you can see their nipples
through their shirts.

62
00:03:29,551 --> 00:03:32,513
What does that have to—?
Really, they know?

63
00:03:36,016 --> 00:03:38,018
There's only a few reasons
why an ex calls.

64
00:03:38,185 --> 00:03:40,562
One, they're great,
and wanna rub your nose in it.

65
00:03:40,729 --> 00:03:43,232
Or two, they're doing lousy
and need to borrow money.

66
00:03:43,398 --> 00:03:46,109
Three, they got money
from knocking over a Laundromat...

67
00:03:46,276 --> 00:03:49,446
and wanna hide it under your trailer
until the heat's off.

68
00:03:51,823 --> 00:03:53,575
It happens.

69
00:03:55,619 --> 00:03:59,748
Okay, okay, how about four?
She misses you, and wants to try again?

70
00:03:59,915 --> 00:04:01,959
What is it she's gonna try?

71
00:04:02,125 --> 00:04:04,336
T o change me into something I'm not?

72
00:04:04,503 --> 00:04:07,673
T o get me to stop drinking,
smoking, gambling?

73
00:04:07,839 --> 00:04:13,136
To rescue me from the barren,
loveless abyss my life has become?

74
00:04:16,723 --> 00:04:18,141
What?

75
00:04:20,477 --> 00:04:21,520
You know what I think?

76
00:04:21,687 --> 00:04:24,106
You were never happier
than when you were with Mia.

77
00:04:24,273 --> 00:04:27,109
You still have feelings for her.
You're afraid to admit it.

78
00:04:27,276 --> 00:04:31,363
You are so wrong.
You couldn't be more wrong.

79
00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:33,991
- You believe that guy?
- You want the truth?

80
00:04:35,117 --> 00:04:38,370
- No, probably not.
- Good call.

81
00:04:38,537 --> 00:04:42,457
Oh, by the way,
here's the 20 bucks I owe you.

82
00:04:51,675 --> 00:04:55,637
I am telling you, it is not appropriate
to wear to the ballet.

83
00:04:58,098 --> 00:05:00,309
Why you tripping on me?

84
00:05:00,517 --> 00:05:04,021
Hey, Alan. Matey.

85
00:05:04,229 --> 00:05:07,566
- I'm not a pirate.
- You're not a gangsta either.

86
00:05:07,733 --> 00:05:11,903
You're a dorky, white kid
with a Cub Scout bandana on his head.

87
00:05:12,654 --> 00:05:15,073
Yo, hate the game,
don't hate the player.

88
00:05:17,492 --> 00:05:21,788
You know kids better than me.
How long does this pimp stage last?

89
00:05:22,164 --> 00:05:23,206
Just ignore him.

90
00:05:23,373 --> 00:05:26,376
- You sure you won't come with us?
- Positive.

91
00:05:26,543 --> 00:05:29,463
- Should I at least say hi to Mia for you?
- Say what you want.

92
00:05:29,671 --> 00:05:31,965
- I'm meeting somebody at Pavlov's.
- Who?

93
00:05:32,174 --> 00:05:34,051
How would I know?
I haven't met her yet.

94
00:05:38,972 --> 00:05:40,932
Hi. Do I look okay?

95
00:05:43,477 --> 00:05:46,897
- Perfect.
- Hey, no fair.

96
00:05:49,941 --> 00:05:54,112
You grow a rack like that, you can
wear anything you want on your head.

97
00:05:56,656 --> 00:05:58,784
You have a house on the beach?

98
00:05:59,534 --> 00:06:01,369
I'd love to see it.

99
00:06:01,536 --> 00:06:04,331
- I could take you there.
- Great.

100
00:06:05,248 --> 00:06:07,709
Then I could bring you out
on my deck.

101
00:06:07,876 --> 00:06:10,212
We could watch the surf
in the moonlight.

102
00:06:10,378 --> 00:06:13,673
Then I could take you in my arms,
kiss you. Not a big kiss.

103
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:16,968
Just a little something that gives you
a taste of what's to come.

104
00:06:17,135 --> 00:06:19,262
Well, let's go.

105
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:22,599
I'd take your hand
and lead you up to my bedroom...

106
00:06:22,766 --> 00:06:24,518
where I'd slowly undress you.

107
00:06:24,684 --> 00:06:26,895
Then lay you down on the crisp,
cool sheets...

108
00:06:27,062 --> 00:06:30,524
and make wild, passionate love
to you until we're both totally spent.

109
00:06:30,899 --> 00:06:32,943
Okay.

110
00:06:34,778 --> 00:06:39,241
Then in the morning, I'll bring you
a cup of coffee and your car keys.

111
00:06:40,450 --> 00:06:42,953
Wait, my car keys?

112
00:06:43,328 --> 00:06:46,164
I'll promise to call you
but I never will.

113
00:06:46,331 --> 00:06:49,668
And when you call me, you'll find
that the phone number I gave you...

114
00:06:49,834 --> 00:06:53,380
belongs to a dry cleaner
in Koreatown.

115
00:06:54,381 --> 00:06:56,174
What?

116
00:06:57,092 --> 00:06:59,803
When all is said and done,
you know what we'll both have?

117
00:06:59,970 --> 00:07:01,096
Nothing.

118
00:07:01,263 --> 00:07:03,682
Not even a good memory.

119
00:07:04,391 --> 00:07:08,520
What do you say we do us both a favor
and not go through with this charade?

120
00:07:09,771 --> 00:07:11,898
Okay.

121
00:07:13,316 --> 00:07:16,278
Jeez, I was just trying to get laid.

122
00:07:23,285 --> 00:07:26,913
See, Jake, the swan is dying.

123
00:07:29,624 --> 00:07:31,751
Can you believe—?

124
00:07:33,628 --> 00:07:39,175
Excuse me. Pardon me.
Pardon me. Excuse me. Hey.

125
00:07:39,342 --> 00:07:41,928
- What did I miss?
- I thought you weren't coming.

126
00:07:42,679 --> 00:07:45,307
I'm not here for Mia.
I'm here to support the arts.

127
00:07:48,226 --> 00:07:51,229
Yikes, look at the package
on that pretty dude.

128
00:07:58,778 --> 00:08:00,322
Hey, good job.

129
00:08:00,488 --> 00:08:01,781
Eat something.

130
00:08:04,743 --> 00:08:08,413
- Charlie.
- Hey. You were terrific.

131
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:10,498
Thank you.

132
00:08:10,665 --> 00:08:12,667
- I'm so glad you came.
- Are you kidding me?

133
00:08:12,834 --> 00:08:15,086
I've been looking forward to this
all week.

134
00:08:15,253 --> 00:08:19,632
- Dressed like that?
- Well, how else would you recognize me?

135
00:08:21,009 --> 00:08:25,180
- These are for you.
- Thank you. They're beautiful.

136
00:08:25,347 --> 00:08:27,766
No big deal, they had them
at the liquor store.

137
00:08:27,932 --> 00:08:30,977
It was either this
or a stack of lotto scratchers.

138
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:36,191
- I think you made the wise choice.
- We'll never know, will we?

139
00:08:36,357 --> 00:08:38,943
Alan would've come,
but he had to take the kids home.

140
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:42,155
- Kids?
- He's kind of adopted a young girl.

141
00:08:42,322 --> 00:08:45,784
- Really?
- Well, not so much adopted as banging.

142
00:08:46,576 --> 00:08:47,702
So you're looking good.

143
00:08:48,119 --> 00:08:53,083
- You too. How have you been?
- Great. Just great. Really great.

144
00:08:53,249 --> 00:08:56,294
- Good.
- No, no. No, great.

145
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:59,672
- And you, how have you been?
- Wonderful.

146
00:09:00,715 --> 00:09:03,426
All right then, I'm great
and you're wonderful.

147
00:09:03,593 --> 00:09:06,221
So what the hell are we doing here?

148
00:09:06,387 --> 00:09:08,932
There was something
I wanted to talk to you about.

149
00:09:09,099 --> 00:09:13,895
- Hey, Mia. Who's your cute friend?
- This is Charlie. Charlie, Theresa.

150
00:09:14,062 --> 00:09:15,522
Hey.

151
00:09:15,688 --> 00:09:17,690
So, what did you want
to talk to me about?

152
00:09:18,358 --> 00:09:20,527
This really isn't the right place.

153
00:09:20,693 --> 00:09:22,987
Why don't I get changed
and stop by your house?

154
00:09:23,154 --> 00:09:24,489
Sure. I'll be up.

155
00:09:24,656 --> 00:09:27,200
- Because, you know, I'm a night person.
- I remember.

156
00:09:27,408 --> 00:09:29,577
Of course, if you come too late,
I could be drunk.

157
00:09:29,744 --> 00:09:32,080
- I remember.
- There could be other women there.

158
00:09:32,247 --> 00:09:33,957
I remember.

159
00:09:34,123 --> 00:09:37,043
- See you later.
- Whatever.

160
00:09:39,587 --> 00:09:42,423
Hey, can you unhook me?

161
00:10:02,527 --> 00:10:04,445
What's going on?

162
00:10:04,946 --> 00:10:06,072
Nothing.

163
00:10:06,239 --> 00:10:08,449
Mia's coming over, so I thought l'd—

164
00:10:08,616 --> 00:10:10,243
Nothing.

165
00:10:10,618 --> 00:10:12,287
- I see.
- What do you mean you see?

166
00:10:14,038 --> 00:10:16,624
You're right. It's too much.

167
00:10:24,215 --> 00:10:26,301
- How's that?
- Well, l—

168
00:10:26,467 --> 00:10:31,014
Right. She'll smell there were candles
burning, so I have to light at least one.

169
00:10:32,307 --> 00:10:34,100
- What about the music?
- What about it?

170
00:10:34,267 --> 00:10:37,020
You're right.
Sounds like I'm trying too hard.

171
00:10:44,485 --> 00:10:45,945
- Better?
- Well, l—

172
00:10:46,112 --> 00:10:47,739
You're right.

173
00:10:48,281 --> 00:10:49,616
No music.

174
00:10:50,074 --> 00:10:51,618
- Charlie?
- Yeah?

175
00:10:51,826 --> 00:10:53,369
I'm just glad you're over her.

176
00:10:56,414 --> 00:10:58,499
Get the door. Get the door.
Get the door.

177
00:11:04,839 --> 00:11:07,383
- Hi, Alan.
- Hey, Mia, you were great tonight.

178
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:11,054
- Thanks. Did Jake like it?
- He was absolutely knocked out.

179
00:11:13,014 --> 00:11:15,475
Charlie, Mia's here.

180
00:11:15,641 --> 00:11:17,769
Oh, really?

181
00:11:17,935 --> 00:11:21,397
- Well, ask her in.
- All right.

182
00:11:22,106 --> 00:11:24,609
- Won't you come in?
- Okay.

183
00:11:25,109 --> 00:11:27,653
Hi, Mia, I almost forgot
you were coming.

184
00:11:28,279 --> 00:11:29,947
Get out.

185
00:11:30,948 --> 00:11:33,117
- Nice to see you again.
- Nice to see you too.

186
00:11:33,284 --> 00:11:35,995
Sit down, make yourself at home.

187
00:11:37,121 --> 00:11:38,414
Place looks the same.

188
00:11:38,581 --> 00:11:41,501
Well, you know me,
if it ain't broke, don't fix it.

189
00:11:41,667 --> 00:11:44,128
If it is broke, who gives a rat's ass?

190
00:11:45,588 --> 00:11:47,882
- Can I get you a drink?
- No, I'm good.

191
00:11:48,049 --> 00:11:52,220
- So am l. In fact, I'm great.
- Yeah, you mentioned that.

192
00:11:52,386 --> 00:11:53,471
Repeatedly.

193
00:11:55,389 --> 00:11:59,727
So, what did you wanna talk about?

194
00:11:59,936 --> 00:12:01,854
Oh, boy.

195
00:12:02,188 --> 00:12:03,648
This is a hard thing to ask.

196
00:12:05,108 --> 00:12:06,317
You need some money.

197
00:12:08,694 --> 00:12:10,279
What? No.

198
00:12:11,114 --> 00:12:13,324
So, what? You wanna get back
together again?

199
00:12:13,491 --> 00:12:15,952
Oh, God no.

200
00:12:23,918 --> 00:12:28,214
All right, then, how about
a quickie for old times' sake?

201
00:12:28,381 --> 00:12:30,341
Please.

202
00:12:30,675 --> 00:12:32,218
Charlie...

203
00:12:32,385 --> 00:12:34,512
I think you're a terrific guy.

204
00:12:34,679 --> 00:12:37,598
You're smart, you're handsome,
you're talented.

205
00:12:37,765 --> 00:12:40,059
All good arguments for the quickie.

206
00:12:40,935 --> 00:12:44,355
- Will you let me finish?
- Didn't I always?

207
00:12:46,190 --> 00:12:48,067
Sorry. Sorry, go on.

208
00:12:48,276 --> 00:12:52,154
I've been thinking a lot lately
about what I want out of life.

209
00:12:53,114 --> 00:12:57,618
I love dancing, but let's face it,
I'm not getting any younger.

210
00:12:57,785 --> 00:13:00,788
So the time has come
for me to make some tough choices.

211
00:13:00,955 --> 00:13:02,665
- I understand completely.
- You do?

212
00:13:02,832 --> 00:13:04,917
No, I'm just trying to be supportive.

213
00:13:06,127 --> 00:13:09,255
Charlie, I came here because—

214
00:13:11,299 --> 00:13:12,633
Well—

215
00:13:15,261 --> 00:13:16,721
I want your sperm.

216
00:13:25,146 --> 00:13:27,398
All right, where do you want it?

217
00:13:34,822 --> 00:13:38,409
- Alan, Alan, wake up. Wake up.
- What?

218
00:13:38,576 --> 00:13:40,703
Mia wants sperm.

219
00:13:41,579 --> 00:13:43,748
Well, don't look at me.

220
00:13:44,165 --> 00:13:46,542
No, no, she wants my sperm.

221
00:13:46,709 --> 00:13:49,629
She wants me to make a deposit
so she can have a baby.

222
00:13:49,795 --> 00:13:53,841
- You're kidding.
- Apparently, that's another of its uses.

223
00:13:56,719 --> 00:13:58,179
What the hell is that?

224
00:13:58,346 --> 00:14:01,766
I'm not sure. Near as I can tell,
she's chasing a rabbit.

225
00:14:03,434 --> 00:14:05,227
So why did Mia come to you?

226
00:14:05,394 --> 00:14:08,689
Well, it turns out
her biological clock is ticking.

227
00:14:08,856 --> 00:14:13,277
Most of the guys she meets are
ballet dancers, so, slim pickings there.

228
00:14:13,944 --> 00:14:16,405
She doesn't wanna wait
for Mr. Right to come along.

229
00:14:16,572 --> 00:14:19,784
- Which pretty much leaves you.
- Yep.

230
00:14:20,451 --> 00:14:23,537
I'm good genetic material,
you know, easy on the eyes.

231
00:14:23,704 --> 00:14:27,750
And she wants to raise the kid alone
which fits nicely into my lifestyle.

232
00:14:28,417 --> 00:14:31,670
Charlie, drinking, gambling
and casual sex is not a lifestyle.

233
00:14:31,837 --> 00:14:34,840
Okay, okay, I didn't come in here
to argue with you.

234
00:14:35,049 --> 00:14:37,385
Look in the hedges,
look in the hedges.

235
00:14:38,302 --> 00:14:39,804
What?

236
00:14:40,262 --> 00:14:41,305
I don't know.

237
00:14:43,307 --> 00:14:46,143
So, what are you gonna do?
You gonna go to a sperm bank?

238
00:14:46,310 --> 00:14:49,605
Well, I tried to talk her into
a direct deposit.

239
00:14:50,272 --> 00:14:51,941
You know, straight from the tap.

240
00:14:53,567 --> 00:14:57,530
But she really dug in her heels.
And not in the good way.

241
00:14:57,738 --> 00:15:00,324
- And you're okay with it?
- Well, why not?

242
00:15:00,491 --> 00:15:02,493
I've sent billions of soldiers out there.

243
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:05,538
It's time for one of them
to finally take the hill.

244
00:15:08,582 --> 00:15:12,128
- Now what?
- I think she caught the rabbit.

245
00:15:13,921 --> 00:15:16,924
Anyway, I'm thinking
this could be my one chance...

246
00:15:17,091 --> 00:15:19,635
to guarantee
that the Charlie gene lives on.

247
00:15:19,802 --> 00:15:22,638
You know, make sure
the double helix that is uniquely me...

248
00:15:22,805 --> 00:15:24,974
keeps on trucking into the future.

249
00:15:25,182 --> 00:15:27,434
Okay, let's assume
that's a good thing.

250
00:15:29,061 --> 00:15:30,980
- One more question.
- Yeah?

251
00:15:31,147 --> 00:15:34,108
If you have no doubts,
why'd you wake me up to tell me?

252
00:15:34,275 --> 00:15:36,360
Well, you're my brother...

253
00:15:36,527 --> 00:15:39,321
and I thought you should know
you're gonna be an uncle.

254
00:15:39,488 --> 00:15:42,283
You mean, I'm gonna be an uncle
to a child I'll never see.

255
00:15:42,908 --> 00:15:46,328
Tell you what, when he turns 12,
I'll track him down...

256
00:15:46,495 --> 00:15:50,541
bring him to live with you and we'll
see if you get your phone messages.

257
00:15:57,173 --> 00:16:00,843
- What do you think?
- Looks like pretty standard boilerplate.

258
00:16:01,010 --> 00:16:05,639
It says that once your swim team's
off the bus, you're no longer the coach.

259
00:16:06,765 --> 00:16:10,019
All right. Let's see, where do I sign?

260
00:16:10,185 --> 00:16:13,355
The old John Hancock, if you will.

261
00:16:14,064 --> 00:16:15,774
You sure you want to?

262
00:16:15,941 --> 00:16:18,444
You're giving up the rights
not only to your sperm...

263
00:16:18,611 --> 00:16:22,531
but to any children
that might result from them. It.

264
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:24,366
- I understand.
- Do you?

265
00:16:24,533 --> 00:16:28,704
Once you sign, Mia can do whatever
she wants with it. Them.

266
00:16:29,038 --> 00:16:34,084
She can use it, resell it, freeze it,
put it on eBay.

267
00:16:34,251 --> 00:16:37,713
Hey, I don't care if she uses it
to caulk her bathtub.

268
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:41,759
Once the boys reach escape velocity,
they're on their own.

269
00:16:42,176 --> 00:16:46,513
- I see.
- It's out of my hands, so to speak.

270
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:48,307
I got it.

271
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:52,144
Okay. I'll be back in two shakes.

272
00:16:53,896 --> 00:16:56,440
Three, if it's cold in there.

273
00:17:50,869 --> 00:17:52,204
Charlie? You okay?

274
00:18:02,464 --> 00:18:05,092
- Charlie?
- What?

275
00:18:05,259 --> 00:18:07,928
You've been in there a long time.
How's it going?

276
00:18:08,095 --> 00:18:09,721
How do you think it's going?

277
00:18:11,098 --> 00:18:15,060
Well, I don't know if this'll help,
but sometimes when I was married...

278
00:18:15,227 --> 00:18:19,022
I used to pretend I was having sex
with a completely different woman.

279
00:18:19,189 --> 00:18:22,901
Oh, thanks. The image of you
bumping uglies with your ex-wife...

280
00:18:23,068 --> 00:18:25,112
should really move things along.

281
00:18:25,487 --> 00:18:27,448
Excuse me, I was just trying to help.

282
00:18:27,614 --> 00:18:30,784
Yeah, well, I was just trying
to have sex with a cup.

283
00:18:30,951 --> 00:18:36,123
Don't think of it as a cup.
Think of it as a polyurethane lapdancer.

284
00:18:36,331 --> 00:18:39,084
- Get out.
- I'm going.

285
00:18:44,756 --> 00:18:47,843
- Hello?
- Charlie, I was just getting packed.

286
00:18:48,010 --> 00:18:50,429
Oh, right, you're heading
to San Francisco.

287
00:18:51,054 --> 00:18:53,307
That's gotta be a big ballet town.

288
00:18:54,266 --> 00:18:55,893
Yeah.

289
00:18:56,476 --> 00:18:58,020
So did you go to the sperm bank?

290
00:18:59,104 --> 00:19:00,689
And?

291
00:19:00,856 --> 00:19:02,900
Not a lot of laughs in that place.

292
00:19:03,066 --> 00:19:05,777
I asked the receptionist
if she takes work home with her.

293
00:19:05,944 --> 00:19:07,988
Nothing. Not even a smile.

294
00:19:08,447 --> 00:19:11,366
Thanks for doing this.
You have no idea what it means to me.

295
00:19:12,701 --> 00:19:16,121
Yeah, well, funny thing, turns out
it means something to me too.

296
00:19:16,330 --> 00:19:20,042
- What are you talking about?
- I tried, Mia, I really did.

297
00:19:20,209 --> 00:19:21,877
I tried the magazines, the movies.

298
00:19:22,044 --> 00:19:24,338
You can't imagine
how bad porn acting is...

299
00:19:24,504 --> 00:19:27,758
until you actually watch more
than three, four minutes at a time.

300
00:19:28,216 --> 00:19:31,011
So you're saying you couldn't? You?

301
00:19:32,387 --> 00:19:34,473
Yeah, I know. What are the odds?

302
00:19:34,932 --> 00:19:39,019
Well, I guess these things happen.
You'll try again. I'm sure you'll do fine.

303
00:19:39,937 --> 00:19:42,105
I don't think so.

304
00:19:42,272 --> 00:19:43,357
Why not?

305
00:19:43,941 --> 00:19:45,651
I have thoughts about the reason...

306
00:19:45,817 --> 00:19:49,613
things didn't go down
as planned, or actually, up.

307
00:19:50,155 --> 00:19:52,115
Okay, I'm listening.

308
00:19:53,367 --> 00:19:55,744
As I was sitting
in that little sperm cubicle...

309
00:19:55,911 --> 00:20:00,999
watching Assmasters 7:
The Final Chapter...

310
00:20:01,667 --> 00:20:05,170
all I could think about was some kid
of mine growing up somewhere...

311
00:20:05,337 --> 00:20:10,092
and me not having a chance to,
you know, be a part of his life.

312
00:20:10,634 --> 00:20:13,387
- I thought you were okay with that.
- I thought I was too.

313
00:20:13,553 --> 00:20:16,014
But as it turns out, I'm not.

314
00:20:16,181 --> 00:20:18,517
So if this is something
you really wanna do...

315
00:20:18,684 --> 00:20:21,395
then you're gonna have
to find someone else.

316
00:20:23,105 --> 00:20:24,731
I see.

317
00:20:24,898 --> 00:20:29,236
And by the way, Assmasters 7
is not the final chapter.

318
00:20:31,154 --> 00:20:33,782
They left a lot of loose ends.

319
00:20:34,908 --> 00:20:38,495
All right, well, I gotta go.

320
00:20:38,662 --> 00:20:41,331
- I appreciate the effort.
- Oh, thanks.

321
00:20:41,498 --> 00:20:44,251
I think I have a rotator cuff injury.

322
00:20:45,127 --> 00:20:47,045
Good seeing you again, Charlie.

323
00:20:49,339 --> 00:20:50,841
Good seeing you too.

324
00:20:56,263 --> 00:20:59,182
- Hey, let me float another idea by you.
- What?

325
00:20:59,349 --> 00:21:01,643
It's a little crazy, a little unorthodox.

326
00:21:01,810 --> 00:21:04,354
If you really want a kid,
this could be the solution.

327
00:21:04,521 --> 00:21:09,025
- Charlie, I am not having sex with you.
- Who said anything about having sex?

328
00:21:09,401 --> 00:21:11,111
I'm asking you to marry me.

329
00:21:21,364 --> 00:21:22,782
There's no Charlie here.

330
00:21:22,948 --> 00:21:25,576
Why you stupid girls keep calling?

331
00:21:25,743 --> 00:21:30,039
No, listen, I don't take message.
I do dry cleaning.

332
00:21:30,456 --> 00:21:34,543
One more time,
