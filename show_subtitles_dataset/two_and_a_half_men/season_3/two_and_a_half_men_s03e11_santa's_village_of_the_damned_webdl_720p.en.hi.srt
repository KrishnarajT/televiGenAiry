1
00:00:06,804 --> 00:00:09,181
- Charlie?
- Yeah?

2
00:00:09,348 --> 00:00:11,475
We said
we were gonna take things slow.

3
00:00:11,642 --> 00:00:14,979
We did say that.
I guess we can't be trusted.

4
00:00:16,522 --> 00:00:19,316
- Charlie, talk to me.
- All right.

5
00:00:19,483 --> 00:00:22,611
You know what I'm gonna do to you,
you dirty, filthy girl?

6
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:27,825
- No, not like that.
- Wrong way? Am I a dirty, filthy boy?

7
00:00:28,325 --> 00:00:30,578
No, I wanna talk about us.

8
00:00:30,744 --> 00:00:33,205
We're a dirty, filthy couple.

9
00:00:34,248 --> 00:00:36,667
No,
I wanna talk about our relationship.

10
00:00:37,751 --> 00:00:40,546
Well, that redirects the old blood flow.

11
00:00:42,798 --> 00:00:46,176
Okay, so what about it?

12
00:00:46,343 --> 00:00:50,598
- You know that I really care about you.
- And I care about you too.

13
00:00:50,764 --> 00:00:52,016
All right, good talk.

14
00:00:52,182 --> 00:00:54,476
I just wanna make sure
that if we do this...

15
00:00:54,643 --> 00:00:56,687
we're doing it for the right reasons.

16
00:00:56,854 --> 00:01:00,983
Well, not to be contrary, but the wrong
reasons kick everything up a notch.

17
00:01:01,734 --> 00:01:03,068
I just wanna make sure...

18
00:01:03,235 --> 00:01:05,404
we give our relationship
a chance to grow.

19
00:01:05,571 --> 00:01:08,866
- So you want to stop?
- No, I really want you.

20
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:15,998
Mia, all this starting and stopping
is really not good for my transmission.

21
00:01:17,207 --> 00:01:20,085
I'm sorry. I'm just so confused. I—

22
00:01:20,252 --> 00:01:23,422
That's why you're gonna have to
make this decision for both of us.

23
00:01:23,589 --> 00:01:26,258
Me? I have to make this decision?

24
00:01:26,425 --> 00:01:29,553
That's like asking the fat kid
to guard the pie.

25
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:31,513
I trust you, Charlie.

26
00:01:32,181 --> 00:01:33,932
Well, that is really low.

27
00:01:35,267 --> 00:01:38,854
- Okay, we'll wait.
- Thank you.

28
00:01:39,021 --> 00:01:42,149
- So, what do we do now?
- We could take a walk on the beach.

29
00:01:42,316 --> 00:01:43,650
No, seriously.

30
00:01:46,195 --> 00:01:49,573
Oh, yeah. Walk on the beach. Great.

31
00:01:50,199 --> 00:01:52,576
I've always been meaning to do that.

32
00:02:00,834 --> 00:02:02,085
Good morning, everyone.

33
00:02:02,252 --> 00:02:04,796
- Good morning.
- Looks to be a beautiful day.

34
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:08,091
Overcast, but that should burn off
in a few hours...

35
00:02:08,258 --> 00:02:11,052
Ieaving us
with a sun-dappled afternoon in paradise.

36
00:02:11,219 --> 00:02:15,015
You still drunk from last night
or did you get a fresh buzz this morning?

37
00:02:15,724 --> 00:02:17,976
No, ma'am,
I am quite simply high on life.

38
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:21,813
Blotto.

39
00:02:22,355 --> 00:02:25,859
I am not drunk.
Alan, guess what I did last night.

40
00:02:26,359 --> 00:02:28,486
- Jake.
- I'm leaving.

41
00:02:28,653 --> 00:02:30,322
No, Jake can hear this.

42
00:02:30,488 --> 00:02:32,574
- Last night—
- Wait, wait. Hang on, Charlie.

43
00:02:32,741 --> 00:02:35,869
You're about to tell us something
that made you happy?

44
00:02:36,036 --> 00:02:37,162
- Yes.
- Jake.

45
00:02:37,329 --> 00:02:38,371
I'm leaving.

46
00:02:38,538 --> 00:02:41,833
Jake, stay. I want to share this
with my entire family.

47
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,126
Okay, I'm leaving.

48
00:02:43,293 --> 00:02:45,462
Berta,
I consider you part of my family.

49
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:48,965
- Am I in your will?
- No, but neither are the rest of them.

50
00:02:51,468 --> 00:02:52,844
Now listen.

51
00:02:53,011 --> 00:02:56,681
Last night, l, Charlie Harper,
delayed gratification.

52
00:02:57,307 --> 00:03:00,268
What did you do,
wait till she fell asleep?

53
00:03:03,188 --> 00:03:05,231
- Wait for what?
- Jake.

54
00:03:05,398 --> 00:03:07,108
- I'm leaving.
- Sit down.

55
00:03:08,109 --> 00:03:12,197
What happened last night is I may
have started a meaningful relationship.

56
00:03:12,364 --> 00:03:16,701
Charlie, seriously, go sleep it off.
You're embarrassing yourself.

57
00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:19,996
Come on, listen to me.

58
00:03:20,163 --> 00:03:23,083
- I think I might be in love with Mia.
- Big deal.

59
00:03:23,249 --> 00:03:25,585
You've always been in love
with you-a.

60
00:03:26,961 --> 00:03:29,339
- Very funny.
- I thought so. Did you think so?

61
00:03:29,506 --> 00:03:31,216
- That was pretty good.
- Yeah.

62
00:03:31,382 --> 00:03:34,636
He's 11. He still thinks
"Milk Milk Lemonade" is funny.

63
00:03:34,803 --> 00:03:36,638
Oh, yeah.

64
00:03:37,347 --> 00:03:39,557
Hello? Grandmommy's here.

65
00:03:39,724 --> 00:03:42,102
Oh, great.
Tell Mom what you told us, Charlie.

66
00:03:42,268 --> 00:03:43,311
No.

67
00:03:43,478 --> 00:03:45,396
- Tell me what?
- Nothing.

68
00:03:45,563 --> 00:03:47,440
- Do you need a good lawyer?
- No.

69
00:03:47,607 --> 00:03:49,150
- Discreet doctor?
- No.

70
00:03:49,317 --> 00:03:51,319
- Knock-off Gucci handbag?
- What?

71
00:03:51,486 --> 00:03:53,905
There's only so many ways
I can help you, dear.

72
00:03:56,324 --> 00:04:00,411
It's no big deal. I've just been seeing
this ballet dancer. She might be the one.

73
00:04:01,621 --> 00:04:03,123
Drunk?

74
00:04:04,332 --> 00:04:05,375
He says, "No. "

75
00:04:05,542 --> 00:04:07,961
I think it might be
one of those designer drugs.

76
00:04:08,128 --> 00:04:11,756
Charlie, what did you take?

77
00:04:13,466 --> 00:04:16,427
I'm serious. We've been
seeing each other for over a month.

78
00:04:16,594 --> 00:04:20,348
We're waiting to sleep together until
our relationship has a solid foundation.

79
00:04:20,515 --> 00:04:24,394
Well, we can rule out ecstasy.
I mean, that's a powerful aphrodisiac.

80
00:04:26,312 --> 00:04:27,564
I've heard.

81
00:04:29,023 --> 00:04:33,027
Nowadays you're supposed to say
"African American-disiac. "

82
00:04:35,321 --> 00:04:36,865
- Jake.
- You sure this time?

83
00:04:37,031 --> 00:04:39,701
- Yeah.
- I'm leaving.

84
00:04:39,868 --> 00:04:42,787
Has it occurred to you
that maybe I've finally matured?

85
00:04:42,954 --> 00:04:45,373
Maybe I'm ready to build something
with a woman...

86
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:47,375
that isn't solely based on sex?

87
00:04:47,542 --> 00:04:49,043
- Has that occurred to you?
- No.

88
00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:50,628
Berta?

89
00:04:50,795 --> 00:04:52,130
So it's not just me.

90
00:04:52,297 --> 00:04:54,757
You know,
I can understand your skepticism.

91
00:04:54,924 --> 00:04:58,094
I've earned it.
But this girl is different.

92
00:04:58,261 --> 00:05:00,471
And I'm gonna make it work.

93
00:05:01,723 --> 00:05:05,310
I give him another week before he's out
on the beach, humping wet sand.

94
00:06:01,657 --> 00:06:03,242
- Hey.
- Hey.

95
00:06:03,409 --> 00:06:04,869
How was your date?

96
00:06:10,625 --> 00:06:12,085
Fun.

97
00:06:13,086 --> 00:06:14,921
We went bowling.

98
00:06:15,671 --> 00:06:17,048
Still playing it slow?

99
00:06:19,717 --> 00:06:21,386
Ketchup slow.

100
00:06:22,970 --> 00:06:25,223
Glacier slow.

101
00:06:26,641 --> 00:06:29,560
Continental drift slow.

102
00:06:30,978 --> 00:06:33,189
- So slow?
- I'm saying.

103
00:06:33,773 --> 00:06:34,899
Hey, listen.

104
00:06:35,066 --> 00:06:39,570
About this living without sex thing. I was
hoping you can give me a little advice.

105
00:06:39,737 --> 00:06:43,074
Me?
What would make you think of me?

106
00:06:43,908 --> 00:06:47,745
Well, I figure you get laid less often
than a boil-covered dwarf, am I right?

107
00:06:48,913 --> 00:06:52,083
I don't have the actual statistics,
but go on.

108
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:55,044
Well, you must get really frustrated.

109
00:06:55,586 --> 00:06:57,964
I mean, how do you stop yourself from,
you know...

110
00:06:58,131 --> 00:07:01,509
running a red light and then
taunting the cop till he shoots you?

111
00:07:01,676 --> 00:07:03,010
Good question.

112
00:07:03,177 --> 00:07:06,597
I've found that the best thing to do
is to focus on your career...

113
00:07:06,973 --> 00:07:10,268
get a hobby, become involved
in community activities...

114
00:07:10,434 --> 00:07:13,312
and at the end of the day,
if you have any energy left...

115
00:07:13,479 --> 00:07:14,647
find a quiet space...

116
00:07:14,814 --> 00:07:17,233
and yank it like a monkey
in a mango tree.

117
00:07:19,735 --> 00:07:21,571
Interesting.

118
00:07:21,737 --> 00:07:23,739
What kind of hobbies
are we talking about?

119
00:07:24,490 --> 00:07:28,286
Well, I tried collecting stamps,
building model trains...

120
00:07:28,452 --> 00:07:32,123
but in the end,
all roads led back up the mango tree.

121
00:07:34,375 --> 00:07:36,794
That's what I was afraid of.

122
00:07:39,046 --> 00:07:40,298
Hey, where are you going?

123
00:07:41,007 --> 00:07:43,509
I'm gonna go get in my car...

124
00:07:43,801 --> 00:07:47,221
run a red light
and hope for a clean headshot.

125
00:07:52,894 --> 00:07:56,230
The great thing about this piece
is that it fuses a classical score...

126
00:07:56,397 --> 00:07:58,816
with jazz choreography.

127
00:08:02,695 --> 00:08:06,032
On a counter programming note,
the Lakers are playing Miami tonight.

128
00:08:06,198 --> 00:08:09,827
- Would you rather watch that?
- No, no, this is fine.

129
00:08:09,994 --> 00:08:13,080
Of course, I don't have a $500 bet
down on the ballet.

130
00:08:15,416 --> 00:08:19,795
- What channel?
- No, seriously, this is— Channel 2.

131
00:08:21,964 --> 00:08:26,552
Charlie, you don't have to give up
things that you like just because of me.

132
00:08:33,643 --> 00:08:36,812
Oh, okay, great. Good to know.

133
00:08:37,313 --> 00:08:40,941
Hey,
as long as we're on that subject...

134
00:08:45,696 --> 00:08:47,698
there's something
I wanna run past you.

135
00:08:47,865 --> 00:08:50,284
- Go ahead.
- Let me just preface it by saying...

136
00:08:50,451 --> 00:08:52,244
that I am for holding off
on sex...

137
00:08:52,411 --> 00:08:56,666
so our relationship can develop more,
you know, deepness.

138
00:08:56,832 --> 00:08:58,542
I'm glad. I think it's working too.

139
00:08:58,709 --> 00:09:02,338
We were getting closer than we would,
had we just jumped into bed together.

140
00:09:02,505 --> 00:09:05,174
Good.
Sounds like we're on the same page.

141
00:09:05,633 --> 00:09:07,927
And just to make sure
we don't jump the gun...

142
00:09:08,094 --> 00:09:10,054
I was thinking it'd be a good idea...

143
00:09:10,221 --> 00:09:15,017
if I had an outlet that,
you know, took the pressure off.

144
00:09:15,518 --> 00:09:17,937
- An outlet?
- Yeah, an outlet.

145
00:09:18,104 --> 00:09:20,272
Something casual, meaningless.

146
00:09:20,439 --> 00:09:23,359
If I work it right,
it could even be anonymous.

147
00:09:26,529 --> 00:09:29,990
- You mean another woman?
- Well, that would be my first choice.

148
00:09:32,451 --> 00:09:36,163
But for the purposes of this discussion,
let's stay with the term, "Outlet. "

149
00:09:36,330 --> 00:09:37,790
I don't care what you call it.

150
00:09:37,957 --> 00:09:40,918
You're asking for permission
to have sex with another woman.

151
00:09:41,085 --> 00:09:45,381
Only because I care about you too much
to whore around without permission.

152
00:09:45,548 --> 00:09:47,591
Are you crazy?

153
00:09:47,758 --> 00:09:50,261
I can't go back to the mango tree,
Mia.

154
00:09:51,095 --> 00:09:52,138
What?

155
00:09:52,304 --> 00:09:56,892
Look, I think this is a mature,
thoughtful suggestion.

156
00:09:57,059 --> 00:10:01,230
In fact, there are many cultures
that embrace the whole outlet concept...

157
00:10:01,397 --> 00:10:03,691
as a way of strengthening
and nurturing...

158
00:10:03,858 --> 00:10:06,068
the primary love relationship.

159
00:10:08,904 --> 00:10:12,950
- You can't dismiss entire cultures with:
- I'm going home.

160
00:10:13,409 --> 00:10:16,078
Oh, come on, we're just talking here.

161
00:10:16,245 --> 00:10:21,000
I propose an idea, then we compromise.
That's the cornerstone of a relationship.

162
00:10:21,167 --> 00:10:22,543
How are we gonna compromise?

163
00:10:22,710 --> 00:10:25,004
Are you gonna have sex
with half a woman?

164
00:10:25,171 --> 00:10:27,089
Is that an option?

165
00:10:32,052 --> 00:10:33,888
What's going on?

166
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:36,557
- We had our first fight.
- Oh, what about?

167
00:10:36,724 --> 00:10:39,310
I suggested
that as long as we weren't having sex...

168
00:10:39,476 --> 00:10:43,230
it'd be good for our relationship
if I had sex with somebody else.

169
00:10:44,773 --> 00:10:46,984
And she didn't buy that?

170
00:10:47,151 --> 00:10:49,069
Wouldn't even discuss it.

171
00:10:50,487 --> 00:10:52,072
Women, huh?

172
00:10:53,574 --> 00:10:57,119
They say they wanna talk,
but they don't wanna talk.

173
00:11:02,207 --> 00:11:04,167
What's the matter with Uncle Charlie?

174
00:11:04,334 --> 00:11:06,962
He's down because he had a fight
with his girlfriend.

175
00:11:07,546 --> 00:11:10,048
- That's too bad.
- Hey, why don't you go talk to him.

176
00:11:10,215 --> 00:11:12,050
- Maybe you can cheer him up.
- How?

177
00:11:12,217 --> 00:11:13,969
I don't know. Tell him a joke.

178
00:11:14,386 --> 00:11:15,929
Okay.

179
00:11:18,181 --> 00:11:20,892
Might as well just give him
a bowl of Milky Ways.

180
00:11:21,059 --> 00:11:24,438
Hey, Uncle Charlie,
what's green, has four legs...

181
00:11:24,604 --> 00:11:28,316
and would kill you
if it fell out of a tree and landed on you?

182
00:11:28,984 --> 00:11:31,027
- What?
- A pool table.

183
00:11:32,612 --> 00:11:36,116
It's funny because
you wouldn't expect it to be in a tree.

184
00:11:40,537 --> 00:11:42,122
Nothing.

185
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:45,834
Okay, I'll talk to him.

186
00:11:46,001 --> 00:11:49,212
Hey, if you can work up a fart,
ask him to pull your finger.

187
00:11:53,925 --> 00:11:56,344
- Hey.
- Hey.

188
00:11:58,221 --> 00:12:02,809
- Still haven't heard from Mia?
- She won't return my calls.

189
00:12:04,853 --> 00:12:07,856
You do realize that suggesting
to have sex with other women...

190
00:12:08,023 --> 00:12:10,567
was a monumentally stupid thing
to do.

191
00:12:12,027 --> 00:12:14,070
Yes, Alan, I realize it.

192
00:12:17,407 --> 00:12:20,452
The question now,
is how do I apologize?

193
00:12:20,619 --> 00:12:22,704
You mean grovel.

194
00:12:22,954 --> 00:12:27,542
No, I mean apologize
with my dignity and pride intact.

195
00:12:28,335 --> 00:12:32,505
Oh, you sad, naive fool.

196
00:12:34,007 --> 00:12:35,675
If marriage taught me anything...

197
00:12:35,842 --> 00:12:38,762
it's that there is no apologizing
without groveling.

198
00:12:39,429 --> 00:12:42,682
- Mia and I aren't married.
- Are you having sex?

199
00:12:43,642 --> 00:12:45,226
Continue.

200
00:12:45,393 --> 00:12:47,145
First of all, the phone's no good.

201
00:12:47,312 --> 00:12:51,149
You must grovel in person.
Humiliation is a visual medium.

202
00:12:51,316 --> 00:12:53,526
- Okay.
- Next, don't go empty-handed.

203
00:12:53,693 --> 00:12:57,864
But keep in mind that any gifts you offer
may end up being thrown at your head.

204
00:12:58,031 --> 00:13:01,493
Flowers, lingerie, jewelry, all good.

205
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:05,538
Picture frames, waffle irons,
steak knives, not so much.

206
00:13:06,373 --> 00:13:08,458
You actually bought your wife
a waffle iron?

207
00:13:08,625 --> 00:13:10,043
I was young.

208
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:12,337
She liked waffles.

209
00:13:13,546 --> 00:13:17,008
Anyway,
the most important thing is sincerity.

210
00:13:17,175 --> 00:13:18,677
- Sincerity?
- Y es.

211
00:13:18,843 --> 00:13:21,805
You absolutely must be able
to fake sincerity.

212
00:13:21,972 --> 00:13:23,890
You know what?
I've underestimated you.

213
00:13:24,057 --> 00:13:27,227
You are far more deceitful
than I've given you credit for.

214
00:13:27,394 --> 00:13:30,772
- Thank you.
- No, I was faking sincerity.

215
00:13:30,939 --> 00:13:33,108
Oh, it's very good.

216
00:13:33,525 --> 00:13:36,027
But all kidding aside,
I really appreciate your help.

217
00:13:36,194 --> 00:13:38,988
- Well, you're welcome.
- Got you again.

218
00:13:39,155 --> 00:13:40,782
That's— That was good.

219
00:13:40,949 --> 00:13:43,451
- Oh, hey, can you do me a favor?
- What's that?

220
00:13:43,618 --> 00:13:45,370
Pull my finger.

221
00:13:45,537 --> 00:13:47,747
- You're bluffing.
- Try me?

222
00:13:51,501 --> 00:13:53,795
Wait, give me another chance.

223
00:13:53,962 --> 00:13:55,547
I though I had one.

224
00:14:07,392 --> 00:14:09,769
- Hi.
- Hi.

225
00:14:10,019 --> 00:14:12,814
- These are for you.
- You didn't have to do that.

226
00:14:12,981 --> 00:14:15,483
Really? My brother said I did.

227
00:14:16,818 --> 00:14:18,194
Well, thank him for me.

228
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:20,363
Come on in.

229
00:14:20,530 --> 00:14:22,741
I just want you to know
how sorry I am.

230
00:14:22,907 --> 00:14:25,410
Actually, I think I owe you an apology.

231
00:14:25,577 --> 00:14:28,455
- You do?
- Yeah, these are for you.

232
00:14:28,621 --> 00:14:31,040
You didn't have to do that.

233
00:14:31,916 --> 00:14:33,918
I shouldn't have gotten so angry
with you.

234
00:14:34,085 --> 00:14:38,006
Not to say that your "outlet" idea wasn't
incredibly juvenile, selfish, moronic—

235
00:14:38,631 --> 00:14:40,175
I accept your apology.

236
00:14:41,926 --> 00:14:44,637
The point is,
is that I really don't have any right...

237
00:14:44,804 --> 00:14:46,973
to object to you
sleeping with other women.

238
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:49,767
We don't have a commitment.
You're free to do whatever.

239
00:14:50,226 --> 00:14:53,813
Thanks. That's great. Very mature.

240
00:14:54,063 --> 00:14:56,191
- So everything's okay now?
- No, you ass.

241
00:14:58,943 --> 00:15:01,529
If we keep seeing each other,
I want a commitment.

242
00:15:01,696 --> 00:15:03,490
- Commitment?
- Yes, a commitment.

243
00:15:03,656 --> 00:15:05,158
Does that mean we can have sex?

244
00:15:05,325 --> 00:15:08,328
Is that the only reason
you'd be willing to make a commitment?

245
00:15:08,578 --> 00:15:10,705
It's in the top two.

246
00:15:11,664 --> 00:15:15,043
Well, I think sex should wait
until we get our relationship on track.

247
00:15:16,002 --> 00:15:18,713
Okay, okay.
Let me make sure I understand this.

248
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:22,383
You want me to make a commitment
that I will not have sex with anyone...

249
00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:24,886
at the same time
I'm not having sex with you?

250
00:15:25,053 --> 00:15:26,554
Yes.

251
00:15:28,056 --> 00:15:30,600
All right,
let's come at this from another angle.

252
00:15:33,561 --> 00:15:37,065
We're gonna be sexually exclusive,
but without the sex?

253
00:15:37,232 --> 00:15:39,609
Well,
I suppose you could look at it that way.

254
00:15:46,574 --> 00:15:48,701
So bottom line...

255
00:15:51,162 --> 00:15:53,957
no sex for Charlie...

256
00:15:55,708 --> 00:15:58,294
with you or anyone else
for the foreseeable future.

257
00:15:58,461 --> 00:16:00,296
Correct.

258
00:16:02,423 --> 00:16:04,217
Are you insane?

259
00:16:04,592 --> 00:16:07,762
If you care about us, it should be
something that you wanna do.

260
00:16:07,929 --> 00:16:09,681
What are you giving up?

261
00:16:09,847 --> 00:16:12,225
- The same thing.
- You wanna sleep with other guys?

262
00:16:12,392 --> 00:16:14,936
- Of course not.
- Then you're giving up nothing.

263
00:16:17,230 --> 00:16:21,234
Tell you what, I'll give up sex.
You give up, I don't know, a kidney.

264
00:16:22,151 --> 00:16:23,945
Come on, don't be stupid.

265
00:16:24,112 --> 00:16:27,657
- Okay, okay, dancing.
- Dancing's my life, Charlie.

266
00:16:28,241 --> 00:16:30,284
Now we have a level playing field.

267
00:16:31,285 --> 00:16:33,329
You know what,
maybe you should just go.

268
00:16:33,496 --> 00:16:36,916
Right, why stay here when I can
just as easily not have sex with you...

269
00:16:37,083 --> 00:16:38,584
in the comfort of my home?

270
00:16:38,751 --> 00:16:40,003
Oh, go to hell.

271
00:16:43,923 --> 00:16:47,301
See?
That's why you didn't get a waffle iron.

272
00:16:54,976 --> 00:16:56,477
Hey, how did it go with Mia?

273
00:16:56,644 --> 00:16:59,397
- Great. We broke up.
- How is that great?

274
00:16:59,564 --> 00:17:01,607
Now I can go back
to being who I really am.

275
00:17:02,191 --> 00:17:03,317
And who's that?

276
00:17:03,484 --> 00:17:05,987
Somebody who doesn't care
who he really is.

277
00:17:06,529 --> 00:17:07,780
Someone who just has fun.

278
00:17:08,239 --> 00:17:10,867
I see. Someone who spends his life
in a drunken haze...

279
00:17:11,033 --> 00:17:13,244
having meaningless sex
with strangers.

280
00:17:13,411 --> 00:17:15,830
If you knew who I am,
why'd you ask?

281
00:17:17,165 --> 00:17:20,710
Hurry, Charlie.
I'm starting to sober up.

282
00:17:21,544 --> 00:17:23,379
Well, we can't have that.

283
00:17:24,255 --> 00:17:28,050
No. You might find out who she is.

284
00:17:31,304 --> 00:17:33,473
- Here you go.
- Good.

285
00:17:33,639 --> 00:17:38,728
Boy, I haven't been this drunk
since I took my SATs.

286
00:17:39,437 --> 00:17:41,105
Doesn't seem to have held you back.

287
00:17:41,272 --> 00:17:45,067
No, just one year. Sixth grade.

288
00:17:48,321 --> 00:17:52,074
Charlie? You okay?

289
00:17:52,241 --> 00:17:54,994
Yeah, I just got a lot on my mind.

290
00:17:55,870 --> 00:17:58,289
Do you wanna look at my boobs?

291
00:18:00,458 --> 00:18:02,752
- No, thanks.
- Are you sure?

292
00:18:02,919 --> 00:18:05,338
It always cheers me up.

293
00:18:10,259 --> 00:18:12,386
Oh, Mia. Hi.

294
00:18:12,553 --> 00:18:14,388
Is Charlie here?

295
00:18:14,555 --> 00:18:17,517
- Tickle, tickle.
- Cut it out.

296
00:18:23,731 --> 00:18:26,859
That was great, do it again.

297
00:18:29,654 --> 00:18:31,322
Alan,
don't you think it's time...

298
00:18:31,489 --> 00:18:33,407
you kept your girlfriend company?

299
00:18:33,574 --> 00:18:36,577
- My what?
- Thanks for playing along.

300
00:18:36,744 --> 00:18:42,667
Oh, yes, my— My girlfriend.
Yes, excuse me. Coming, pookie.

301
00:18:46,045 --> 00:18:50,049
- Well, this is an awkward moment.
- You are such a schmuck.

302
00:18:50,883 --> 00:18:53,010
Okay, the ice is broken.

303
00:18:53,177 --> 00:18:54,679
- Goodbye, Charlie.
- Oh, come on.

304
00:18:54,845 --> 00:18:57,765
We don't have a commitment.
We don't have a relationship.

305
00:18:57,932 --> 00:19:00,101
You know, you're right.
Go back to your bimbo.

306
00:19:00,268 --> 00:19:02,395
Hey, hey, hey. She's not a bimbo.

307
00:19:07,942 --> 00:19:10,444
I'm not saying she's a brain surgeon.

308
00:19:10,611 --> 00:19:13,281
No, wait, Mia.
At least tell me why you came.

309
00:19:14,073 --> 00:19:16,909
You wanna know why?
I came because after I cooled down...

310
00:19:17,076 --> 00:19:19,704
I started to miss you
and I wanted to make love.

311
00:19:20,204 --> 00:19:22,999
- That's great. It's wonderful.
- And it's not gonna happen.

312
00:19:23,541 --> 00:19:25,209
Why? Because of that bimbo?

313
00:19:26,127 --> 00:19:28,087
Let me tell you something.

314
00:19:28,587 --> 00:19:32,591
The entire time I was fooling around
with her, I was thinking of you.

315
00:19:32,758 --> 00:19:34,760
Oh, swell.

316
00:19:34,927 --> 00:19:36,345
You know what I mean.

317
00:19:36,512 --> 00:19:39,348
I would trade a hundred of her
for one of you.

318
00:19:39,932 --> 00:19:41,642
You're ready to make a commitment?

319
00:19:41,809 --> 00:19:43,352
Yes.

320
00:19:43,686 --> 00:19:46,022
Maybe you want some time
to think about it?

321
00:19:46,188 --> 00:19:48,274
How could that help?

322
00:19:48,441 --> 00:19:51,152
Look, I don't wanna be
with anybody but you...

323
00:19:51,318 --> 00:19:53,404
so I might as well be committed.

324
00:19:54,321 --> 00:19:55,781
Yes, you should.

325
00:19:59,869 --> 00:20:03,456
- You wanna go upstairs?
- Not right now.

326
00:20:03,622 --> 00:20:06,667
Oh, please don't tell me
you've got somebody in your room.

327
00:20:06,834 --> 00:20:09,545
No, no, no.

328
00:20:09,712 --> 00:20:11,255
No.

329
00:20:12,214 --> 00:20:14,258
If we're gonna
do this commitment thing...

330
00:20:14,425 --> 00:20:17,511
the first time
should be really special.

331
00:20:17,845 --> 00:20:19,096
What have you got in mind?

332
00:20:19,263 --> 00:20:21,307
Well, you know. Candles, music...

333
00:20:21,474 --> 00:20:24,560
and maybe not having the girl
I was trying to rebound with...

334
00:20:24,727 --> 00:20:27,521
dancing half naked on the deck
with my idiot brother.

335
00:20:28,022 --> 00:20:30,691
- Are you sure?
- Oh, yeah. He's an idiot.

336
00:20:32,193 --> 00:20:34,236
Call me later.

337
00:20:39,950 --> 00:20:43,496
Well, back to the mango tree.

338
00:20:54,465 --> 00:20:55,716

A healthy cereal
that won't rot your teeth.

340
00:20:58,302 --> 00:21:00,679
You got that right,
because I'm not eating it.

341
00:21:01,514 --> 00:21:02,848
That's all you're getting.

342
00:21:03,932 --> 00:21:05,225

Uncle Charlie,
I got another joke for you.

346
00:21:16,695 --> 00:21:18,321
- Okay.
- There's two muffins...

347
00:21:18,488 --> 00:21:21,116
sitting side by side
in a muffin tin in the oven.

348
00:21:21,283 --> 00:21:23,702
One muffin says,
"Boy, it's hot in here. "

349
00:21:23,869 --> 00:21:27,289
And the other one says,
"Holy crap, a talking muffin. "

350
00:21:30,876 --> 00:21:34,504
I just don't think
he knows what's funny.
