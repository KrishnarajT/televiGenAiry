1
00:00:03,130 --> 00:00:06,133
Doc, how many more adjustments
do you think I'm gonna need?

2
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:08,594
Well, Mr. Malinkovich, let's see.

3
00:00:08,761 --> 00:00:12,640
My son won't graduate college
till 2015...

4
00:00:12,806 --> 00:00:15,559
so a lot.

5
00:00:17,227 --> 00:00:18,979
See you next time.

6
00:00:21,357 --> 00:00:22,858
Okay, Mr. Dunlop.

7
00:00:23,025 --> 00:00:26,487
It's good to see you again, sir.
And how are we doing today?

8
00:00:27,446 --> 00:00:30,699
Not good. I was making love
to my wife last night—

9
00:00:30,866 --> 00:00:33,118
Oh, my God, is she okay?

10
00:00:33,285 --> 00:00:35,746
She's fine. She was on top.

11
00:00:35,913 --> 00:00:37,498
But my back went out, doc.

12
00:00:37,665 --> 00:00:40,626
Okay, well, let's get you on the table
and get to work.

13
00:00:42,544 --> 00:00:44,755
Whoa, steady there big fella.

14
00:00:45,589 --> 00:00:48,676
I took some pain pills my wife
had left over from her C-section.

15
00:00:48,842 --> 00:00:52,388
- I guess my legs are a little rubbery.
- Well, how many pills did you take?

16
00:00:52,554 --> 00:00:53,639
Well, let's see.

17
00:00:53,806 --> 00:00:58,769
One when I went to bed,
one when I got up. Seven.

18
00:00:59,561 --> 00:01:01,897
Really? You know it's not usually
a good idea...

19
00:01:02,064 --> 00:01:04,108
to pop class A narcotics
like Skittles.

20
00:01:05,651 --> 00:01:08,445
- I gotta lie down.
- Okay, okay, but not here, not now.

21
00:01:08,612 --> 00:01:13,742
No, no, no. Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

22
00:01:14,618 --> 00:01:16,370
Mr. Dunlop?

23
00:01:16,537 --> 00:01:18,789
Mr. Dunlop, you need to get up.

24
00:01:19,915 --> 00:01:22,209
Help.

25
00:01:23,252 --> 00:01:25,212
Fire.

26
00:01:26,547 --> 00:01:29,591
Big giant guy.

27
00:01:33,637 --> 00:01:36,140
Oh, perfect.

28
00:01:44,690 --> 00:01:46,817
Dr. Harper speaking.

29
00:01:49,945 --> 00:01:52,573
Judith, this is not a good time.

30
00:01:53,073 --> 00:01:55,159
I'm with a patient.

31
00:01:55,909 --> 00:01:58,078
Well, what about Jake?

32
00:01:58,245 --> 00:02:02,749
Well, no, I can't pick him up
at school now. Why can't you do it?

33
00:02:03,041 --> 00:02:06,920
You're not the only one
under pressure, Judith.

34
00:02:07,296 --> 00:02:10,424
All right, all right. I'll call Charlie
and have him pick him up.

35
00:02:16,263 --> 00:02:19,016
Hey, hey, stop that.

36
00:02:19,975 --> 00:02:22,477
Hey, stop that.

37
00:02:25,355 --> 00:02:26,899
Do you need to get it?

38
00:02:27,065 --> 00:02:28,775
No, the machine will pick up.

39
00:02:28,942 --> 00:02:32,654
Hey, it's Charlie.
Do your thing when you hear the beep.

40
00:02:33,197 --> 00:02:36,241
Charlie, I need your help.

41
00:02:36,408 --> 00:02:38,619
Oh, pick up, pick up, pick up.

42
00:02:38,785 --> 00:02:40,787
Oh, for God's sake.

43
00:02:42,331 --> 00:02:43,874
See?

44
00:02:54,185 --> 00:02:55,478
Hey, look who's here.

45
00:02:55,645 --> 00:02:57,313
- Hi.
- How come you' re not in school?

46
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:59,649
He got sent home for misbehaving.

47
00:02:59,815 --> 00:03:01,025
Well, it's about time.

48
00:03:03,069 --> 00:03:05,780
When I was your age,
I had already been arrested twice.

49
00:03:06,364 --> 00:03:07,657
Charlie, don't.

50
00:03:07,823 --> 00:03:09,825
No convictions.

51
00:03:09,992 --> 00:03:12,578
I had a bad day.
I had to cancel all my patients...

52
00:03:12,745 --> 00:03:15,873
- ... and close my office to pick him up.
- Wow, what a drag.

53
00:03:17,166 --> 00:03:18,960
I got new video games.
You wanna play?

54
00:03:19,126 --> 00:03:21,212
- Sure.
- Did you forget you're punished?

55
00:03:21,379 --> 00:03:24,090
No, why does Uncle Charlie
have to suffer?

56
00:03:24,924 --> 00:03:25,967
Go to your room.

57
00:03:26,133 --> 00:03:28,719
In some countries you're innocent
until proven guilty.

58
00:03:28,886 --> 00:03:30,096
You confessed.

59
00:03:30,638 --> 00:03:32,390
Oh, yeah.

60
00:03:33,474 --> 00:03:36,936
And that country you're thinking of
is this one, genius.

61
00:03:39,063 --> 00:03:41,065
- What did he do?
- Something awful.

62
00:03:41,232 --> 00:03:44,652
How awful?
These are all multi-player games.

63
00:03:45,444 --> 00:03:49,031
Apparently, there is a little girl in
Jake's class named Barbara Schmidt...

64
00:03:49,198 --> 00:03:53,160
who is a little more physically
developed than the other girls.

65
00:03:53,327 --> 00:03:57,873
And Jake decided to make a picture
of her and pass it around.

66
00:04:06,173 --> 00:04:08,300
I only passed it to one person.

67
00:04:08,467 --> 00:04:12,346
What happened after that
was not my responsibility.

68
00:04:12,888 --> 00:04:16,183
Dude, why did you sign it?

69
00:04:17,017 --> 00:04:19,729
Okay, that part I regret.

70
00:04:19,937 --> 00:04:22,732
Go back to your room.

71
00:04:23,232 --> 00:04:25,568
"Boobra Schmidt. "

72
00:04:25,735 --> 00:04:28,112
I'm putting this one
on the refrigerator.

73
00:04:29,155 --> 00:04:32,533
- Charlie, this is serious.
- lt really speaks to me.

74
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:35,494
The girl went home in tears.
Her mother is on the warpath.

75
00:04:35,661 --> 00:04:37,913
- Jake could get expelled.
- For a silly drawing?

76
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:41,709
It's considered sexual harassment.
The school has a zero tolerance policy.

77
00:04:41,876 --> 00:04:44,044
For the good old days
when you could wander...

78
00:04:44,211 --> 00:04:46,922
into the girls' locker room
pretending you were blind.

79
00:04:48,382 --> 00:04:50,259
You actually did that?
That's horrible.

80
00:04:50,885 --> 00:04:54,263
No, the horrible part was
stealing the dog from the blind kid.

81
00:04:56,223 --> 00:04:58,225
Well, unfortunately,
times have changed...

82
00:04:58,392 --> 00:05:01,061
and we no longer live
in a Porky's movie.

83
00:05:01,228 --> 00:05:03,898
What's a Porky's movie?

84
00:05:04,064 --> 00:05:07,610
Close the door.
I'll be in to talk with you in a minute.

85
00:05:08,319 --> 00:05:11,071
Go easy on him. He doesn't
understand what he did wrong.

86
00:05:11,238 --> 00:05:14,033
He's right. I don't have a clue.

87
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:16,243
I thought I told you to close the door.

88
00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:18,913
It is closed.

89
00:05:19,455 --> 00:05:23,250
- Go in your room.
- Fine.

90
00:05:23,542 --> 00:05:25,628
You know what,
maybe I should talk to him.

91
00:05:25,794 --> 00:05:27,379
Oh, now you wanna help?

92
00:05:28,547 --> 00:05:29,965
What's that supposed to mean?

93
00:05:30,132 --> 00:05:32,218
It means why didn't you
pick up the phone...

94
00:05:32,384 --> 00:05:34,386
when I needed you
this afternoon?

95
00:05:34,803 --> 00:05:36,722
I didn't want to.

96
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:39,725
See, see? I can't depend on you.

97
00:05:39,892 --> 00:05:42,603
I never have been able
to depend on you. I never will be.

98
00:05:42,770 --> 00:05:45,564
- You know why?
- Because I'm undependable?

99
00:05:45,773 --> 00:05:48,651
Yes, yes. Undependable and selfish.

100
00:05:48,817 --> 00:05:50,444
And frankly, I'm the idiot.

101
00:05:50,611 --> 00:05:52,404
I've deluded myself into believing...

102
00:05:52,571 --> 00:05:55,783
that when I desperately needed
my brother to pick up my kid...

103
00:05:55,950 --> 00:05:58,786
he might actually bother to pick up
the freaking phone.

104
00:05:58,994 --> 00:06:04,124
Okay, okay, in my defense,
I really didn't want to.

105
00:06:06,001 --> 00:06:09,463
Okay, you're right. I'm sorry,
I should have picked up the phone.

106
00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:12,466
Forget it. What's done is done.
No sense grinding on it.

107
00:06:12,675 --> 00:06:14,134
Thank you.

108
00:06:14,343 --> 00:06:17,638
I just have to accept the fact
that I can't count on anyone.

109
00:06:17,805 --> 00:06:20,182
Least of all an emotionally immature
narcissist...

110
00:06:20,349 --> 00:06:23,644
who thinks the sun rises out
of his navel, sets in his scrotum...

111
00:06:23,811 --> 00:06:26,939
and only cares
about what lies between the two.

112
00:06:27,147 --> 00:06:30,442
Okay, I'm no expert,
but that sounds a lot like grinding.

113
00:06:31,652 --> 00:06:33,153
I am done talking to you.

114
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:36,407
Oh, come on, Alan, I said I was sorry.
Give me another chance.

115
00:06:36,573 --> 00:06:37,992
For what? To let me down?

116
00:06:38,158 --> 00:06:41,078
Tell me what I can do.
Name something. Anything.

117
00:06:42,329 --> 00:06:46,542
Okay, I have to go to Jake's school
if I can keep him from being expelled.

118
00:06:46,709 --> 00:06:48,961
You want me to go?
I am there. Count on me.

119
00:06:49,128 --> 00:06:51,463
No, my receptionist is out sick
all week.

120
00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:54,633
And I need somebody to handle
the phones while I'm gone.

121
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,677
- ln your office?
- Yes.

122
00:06:56,885 --> 00:06:58,345
Way out in the valley?

123
00:06:58,929 --> 00:07:00,514
Yes.

124
00:07:00,681 --> 00:07:02,182
All day?

125
00:07:02,349 --> 00:07:03,600
Yes.

126
00:07:03,767 --> 00:07:05,978
Gee, tomorrow is not really good
for me.

127
00:07:09,565 --> 00:07:11,108
All right. All right, what time?

128
00:07:11,775 --> 00:07:14,486
- The office opens at 8.
- O'clock?

129
00:07:16,155 --> 00:07:18,323
No, degrees.

130
00:07:18,532 --> 00:07:20,868
No reason to be snide,
I don't wanna be late.

131
00:07:21,035 --> 00:07:23,537
Fine. We leave at 7.

132
00:07:25,456 --> 00:07:27,291
O'clock?

133
00:07:30,461 --> 00:07:33,714
Okay, Charlie, time to get up
and go to work.

134
00:07:33,881 --> 00:07:35,424
Charlie?

135
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,635
Of course.

136
00:07:38,802 --> 00:07:41,930
Never even came home.

137
00:07:45,142 --> 00:07:46,518
Why help your only brother...

138
00:07:46,685 --> 00:07:49,605
when you can be out
boffing total strangers?

139
00:07:51,398 --> 00:07:54,443
"I'll be there for you.
You can count on me. "

140
00:07:56,653 --> 00:07:59,782
My own fault.
I'm just stupid and gullible—

141
00:07:59,948 --> 00:08:02,242
And annoying. Don't forget annoying.

142
00:08:03,202 --> 00:08:05,370
- You're here?
- You said 7:00, right?

143
00:08:05,537 --> 00:08:07,331
- You got yourself up?
- Didn't have to.

144
00:08:07,498 --> 00:08:09,583
- Why not.
- Didn't sleep.

145
00:08:10,834 --> 00:08:13,462
- You haven't been to bed?
- Not my bed.

146
00:08:14,671 --> 00:08:17,257
You want coffee? I made
some coffee. It's good coffee.

147
00:08:17,424 --> 00:08:19,218
No more coffee.

148
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:22,513
Why don't you make some more
coffee while I go take a squirt?

149
00:08:22,763 --> 00:08:26,099
- Morning.
- Berta. Berta, Berta, Bert, Bert, Bert.

150
00:08:27,017 --> 00:08:29,311
- He just getting home?
- Yeah.

151
00:08:29,478 --> 00:08:33,440
You gotta wonder how long he'd
keep burning that penis at both ends.

152
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:37,319
I try not to think about it.

153
00:08:37,486 --> 00:08:40,322
Listen, Charlie's coming with me
to work today.

154
00:08:40,489 --> 00:08:42,824
- Why?
- He's gonna help me at the office.

155
00:08:42,991 --> 00:08:44,660
You wanna bet?

156
00:08:44,868 --> 00:08:47,287
- What's up with Uncle Charlie?
- What do you mean?

157
00:08:47,454 --> 00:08:48,956
He's peeing off the deck.

158
00:08:50,499 --> 00:08:52,000
I thought we weren't allowed
to.

159
00:08:52,167 --> 00:08:54,795
- We're not.
- We're not?

160
00:08:56,338 --> 00:08:57,714
No, we're not.

161
00:08:57,923 --> 00:09:01,510
Okay. What's the Oompa Loompa
doing here on a weekday?

162
00:09:02,302 --> 00:09:05,639
- He got suspended from school.
- Why isn't he with his mother?

163
00:09:06,723 --> 00:09:10,102
Judith had a little liposuction
yesterday...

164
00:09:10,269 --> 00:09:11,979
and she needs to stay in bed...

165
00:09:12,145 --> 00:09:15,774
until she stops leaking fat.

166
00:09:15,983 --> 00:09:19,236
Yeah, I hate it when that happens.

167
00:09:21,238 --> 00:09:23,448
So, what did the melon-head do?

168
00:09:23,615 --> 00:09:26,118
Oh, it's a long story.

169
00:09:27,452 --> 00:09:29,830
Worth a thousand words.

170
00:09:29,997 --> 00:09:32,874
Come on, Charlie, let's go.

171
00:09:33,041 --> 00:09:35,002
Hang on. I'm not done yet.

172
00:09:35,168 --> 00:09:38,588
Oh, will you leave the sea gulls alone
for crying out loud?

173
00:09:40,841 --> 00:09:42,467
So...

174
00:09:43,677 --> 00:09:46,763
you like making fun of girls
with big boobs?

175
00:09:52,644 --> 00:09:54,730
Not anymore.

176
00:10:20,672 --> 00:10:21,715
Gridlock.

177
00:10:26,803 --> 00:10:28,555
Stop.

178
00:10:30,265 --> 00:10:33,268
People do this every day?
Drive to work at eight miles an hour?

179
00:10:33,435 --> 00:10:34,728
Pretty much.

180
00:10:34,936 --> 00:10:37,481
I'd have to kill myself.

181
00:10:37,939 --> 00:10:39,858
- Oh, click.
- What?

182
00:10:40,025 --> 00:10:41,777
I just had a phenomenal
business idea.

183
00:10:41,943 --> 00:10:44,571
They haven't perfected
personal jetpacks yet.

184
00:10:46,364 --> 00:10:48,075
Okay, I have another one.

185
00:10:48,283 --> 00:10:51,453
We buy a doughnut machine
and put it in your trunk.

186
00:10:52,537 --> 00:10:54,039
Let's go back to the jetpacks.

187
00:10:54,706 --> 00:10:57,334
Hear me out. Next time you're stuck
in a traffic jam...

188
00:10:57,501 --> 00:11:01,213
just pop your trunk and sell
doughnuts to all the other drivers.

189
00:11:01,379 --> 00:11:03,215
We'll call them...

190
00:11:03,381 --> 00:11:05,217
Gridnuts.

191
00:11:05,634 --> 00:11:07,803
Trunk Crullers.

192
00:11:09,387 --> 00:11:12,307
Stop 'n' Go-Nuts.

193
00:11:12,474 --> 00:11:13,683
- Charlie?
- Yeah?

194
00:11:13,850 --> 00:11:15,685
- Please stop talking.
- Okay.

195
00:11:18,021 --> 00:11:21,608
I got it. Trunkin' Donuts.

196
00:11:31,409 --> 00:11:36,665
Here it is. The chiropractic offices
of Dr. Alan Harper.

197
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:40,126
This is where you come every day?

198
00:11:40,293 --> 00:11:42,254
Yep. For 11 years.
What do you think?

199
00:11:44,714 --> 00:11:47,843
I would have killed myself
10 and a half years ago.

200
00:11:49,302 --> 00:11:52,556
Okay. Now, all you have to do
is sit here.

201
00:11:52,722 --> 00:11:57,227
And when the phone rings, pick it up
and say, "Dr. Harper's office. "

202
00:11:57,394 --> 00:11:58,770
So right off the bat, I lie?

203
00:12:01,648 --> 00:12:02,983
I am a doctor, Charlie.

204
00:12:03,149 --> 00:12:05,402
Yeah, and I'm king
of the traffic doughnuts.

205
00:12:09,823 --> 00:12:13,535
Moving on. I've canceled
all the morning appointments...

206
00:12:13,702 --> 00:12:16,204
the only thing you're gonna
deal with is walk-ins.

207
00:12:16,371 --> 00:12:18,665
Have them make an appointment
for another time.

208
00:12:18,832 --> 00:12:21,209
So I don't get to crack
anybody's back?

209
00:12:21,376 --> 00:12:25,630
Charlie, listen to me very carefully.

210
00:12:25,797 --> 00:12:29,134
You must not touch the patients.

211
00:12:31,261 --> 00:12:34,639
This is not me talking.
This is the State of California.

212
00:12:36,641 --> 00:12:39,269
- Okay.
- Let me be absolutely clear.

213
00:12:40,854 --> 00:12:42,897
No touching the patients.

214
00:12:43,106 --> 00:12:44,733
Got it.

215
00:12:44,941 --> 00:12:47,527
What did I just say to you?
Repeat it back to me.

216
00:12:47,694 --> 00:12:50,488
Boy, you're really not
a morning person, are you?

217
00:12:50,697 --> 00:12:52,866
All right, I gotta go
get to Jake's school.

218
00:12:53,033 --> 00:12:55,535
Say a prayer that I can keep him
from being expelled.

219
00:12:55,702 --> 00:12:59,122
Don't worry about a thing. It's
under control. You can count on me.

220
00:12:59,289 --> 00:13:02,292
Oh, if I could believe
even one of those things.

221
00:13:37,952 --> 00:13:40,955
Okay. Where can I hang myself?

222
00:13:47,003 --> 00:13:48,546
Hello.

223
00:13:49,089 --> 00:13:50,882
Oh, hey, Alan.

224
00:13:51,424 --> 00:13:54,010
I said, "Dr. Harper's office. "

225
00:13:54,177 --> 00:13:55,762
I did.

226
00:13:55,929 --> 00:13:58,765
You know what, call back
and give me another chance.

227
00:14:03,978 --> 00:14:06,481
Hello. Damn, try it again.

228
00:14:13,113 --> 00:14:15,990
- Are you waiting to see the principal?
- Yeah.

229
00:14:16,157 --> 00:14:18,910
- Oh, have a seat.
- Oh, thank you.

230
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:27,126
- Alan.
- Mindy.

231
00:14:27,293 --> 00:14:29,712
- Nice to meet you.
- You too.

232
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:45,937
You must be Boobra's mom.

233
00:14:53,194 --> 00:14:55,196
Barbara's mams.

234
00:14:59,534 --> 00:15:01,119
Hi.

235
00:15:05,707 --> 00:15:08,793
Don't worry, Alan.
I'm not touching the patients.

236
00:15:11,379 --> 00:15:14,424
There are human lives
at stake here, man.

237
00:15:14,591 --> 00:15:17,677
I need those spines delivered
immediately.

238
00:15:19,554 --> 00:15:22,557
Hello. Can I give you
a complimentary adjustment?

239
00:15:23,224 --> 00:15:25,059
I'm here for the masseuse position.

240
00:15:25,268 --> 00:15:29,105
I see. Well, I'm really not authorized
to do any hiring...

241
00:15:29,272 --> 00:15:32,317
but you're obviously qualified.

242
00:15:34,986 --> 00:15:37,614
So the hell with protocol,
welcome aboard.

243
00:15:39,741 --> 00:15:42,910
Let me tell you, puberty is
hard enough for a young girl...

244
00:15:43,077 --> 00:15:47,123
without having to be leered at and
made fun of by obnoxious little boys.

245
00:15:47,290 --> 00:15:49,542
I couldn't agree with you more.
I assure you...

246
00:15:49,709 --> 00:15:53,379
I've had a talk with Jake about how
wrong it is to objectify women's—

247
00:15:53,546 --> 00:15:56,424
Up here. I'm up here.

248
00:15:57,175 --> 00:16:01,346
I know. I know. I see you.
And let me tell you something.

249
00:16:01,512 --> 00:16:03,639
There is no one more sympathetic
than l...

250
00:16:03,806 --> 00:16:06,100
to the plight
of the large-breasted woman.

251
00:16:07,977 --> 00:16:10,063
Plight? It's not an affliction.

252
00:16:10,229 --> 00:16:13,858
Well, no, not the breasts themselves
but the attendant back problems...

253
00:16:14,025 --> 00:16:17,236
associated with carrying
the enormous load.

254
00:16:18,529 --> 00:16:21,115
So now my breasts are a load?

255
00:16:21,324 --> 00:16:24,202
From a strictly engineering standpoint,
yes.

256
00:16:25,078 --> 00:16:26,662
See, see, I am a chiropractor.

257
00:16:26,829 --> 00:16:29,457
And I deal with the heartache
of MMS all the time.

258
00:16:29,624 --> 00:16:32,210
- MMS?
- Massive Mammary Syndrome.

259
00:16:33,753 --> 00:16:35,838
A term I coined in an article
I submitted...

260
00:16:36,005 --> 00:16:38,925
to the Journal of the American
Chiropractic Association.

261
00:16:39,092 --> 00:16:40,885
It hasn't really caught on.

262
00:16:41,052 --> 00:16:44,138
Anyway, MMS is particularly acute
among strippers...

263
00:16:44,305 --> 00:16:48,184
but they bring it on themselves
with those humongous implants.

264
00:16:48,351 --> 00:16:50,645
Yours, on the other hand,
appear quite natural.

265
00:16:50,812 --> 00:16:52,897
God given, am I right?

266
00:16:55,483 --> 00:16:57,235
What the hell is wrong with you?

267
00:16:59,570 --> 00:17:00,947
I don't know.

268
00:17:02,490 --> 00:17:04,826
I was a bottle baby.

269
00:17:14,418 --> 00:17:16,712
I'm sorry, Dr. Harper's
not in this morning.

270
00:17:16,879 --> 00:17:19,841
If your back's bothering you,
we do have a masseuse on duty.

271
00:17:20,007 --> 00:17:21,467
Fine. Anything.

272
00:17:21,634 --> 00:17:24,846
Let's see, she just went in with
a patient about five minutes ago.

273
00:17:25,012 --> 00:17:28,808
- So if you don't mind waiting—
- Thank you, that was great.

274
00:17:29,559 --> 00:17:31,144
Good. Come back soon.

275
00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:33,938
Soon? I'll be back after lunch.

276
00:17:37,191 --> 00:17:38,276
- You next?
- Oh, please.

277
00:17:38,442 --> 00:17:39,902
Let's go.

278
00:17:42,238 --> 00:17:44,157
- What's this?
- Your cut.

279
00:17:47,159 --> 00:17:49,036
Click!

280
00:17:51,372 --> 00:17:54,000
- I am really sorry.
- Just drop it.

281
00:17:56,085 --> 00:18:00,423
You know, in my defense—
Well, well, in the defense of all men...

282
00:18:00,590 --> 00:18:02,967
we do live in a mammo-centric
society.

283
00:18:03,175 --> 00:18:04,635
Mammo-centric?

284
00:18:05,887 --> 00:18:07,471
Another coinage of mine.

285
00:18:07,638 --> 00:18:11,601
Hasn't really permeated
the cultural Zeitgeist.

286
00:18:11,767 --> 00:18:14,145
Hey, bottle baby, I'm up here.

287
00:18:14,854 --> 00:18:17,899
That perfectly illustrates my points.
Point.

288
00:18:20,484 --> 00:18:24,447
From the moment we are born, we are
basically bombarded by breasts.

289
00:18:25,531 --> 00:18:28,367
Breasts in advertising,
breasts in television, in movies.

290
00:18:28,534 --> 00:18:31,871
Here a breast, there a breast,
everywhere a breast-breast.

291
00:18:32,455 --> 00:18:34,665
Heck, you can understand
the fixation.

292
00:18:35,499 --> 00:18:37,668
You're a horrible little man.

293
00:18:38,544 --> 00:18:42,340
Okay, I had hoped that we could have
a spirited exchange of ideas here.

294
00:18:42,506 --> 00:18:45,343
But if we are gonna just degenerate
into name-calling...

295
00:18:45,509 --> 00:18:49,221
we should wait for the principal to
decide what a reasonable punishment...

296
00:18:49,388 --> 00:18:52,391
- ... for my son would be.
- Fine. We'll let the principal decide.

297
00:18:52,558 --> 00:18:53,976
Okay.

298
00:18:57,063 --> 00:18:59,190
I'm Principal Gallagher.

299
00:18:59,732 --> 00:19:02,735
Oh, God,
my boy's gonna get the chair.

300
00:19:08,157 --> 00:19:09,992
Time.

301
00:19:13,913 --> 00:19:16,082
Man, is this day ever gonna end?

302
00:19:21,629 --> 00:19:22,880
Hey, Alan.

303
00:19:26,759 --> 00:19:27,968
What's going on here?

304
00:19:28,135 --> 00:19:29,970
I had another business idea.

305
00:19:30,179 --> 00:19:32,264
- You what?
- Hear me out.

306
00:19:32,431 --> 00:19:35,017
What do men like better
than doughnuts?

307
00:19:38,437 --> 00:19:40,231
Hang on.

308
00:19:41,690 --> 00:19:43,526
Time.

309
00:19:50,658 --> 00:19:55,287
Four thousand two hundred,
4300, 301, 302—

310
00:19:55,454 --> 00:19:58,124
I hate singles.
Don't you hate singles?

311
00:19:58,290 --> 00:20:02,044
You turned my business
into a brothel.

312
00:20:02,211 --> 00:20:05,339
I thought you'd be proud of me.
I didn't touch a single patient.

313
00:20:05,548 --> 00:20:08,259
I left you alone
for a couple of hours...

314
00:20:08,426 --> 00:20:11,137
and you turned my business
into a brothel.

315
00:20:11,971 --> 00:20:14,473
You know what you need?
A nice, relaxing massage.

316
00:20:14,682 --> 00:20:17,226
Oh, shut up.

317
00:20:17,393 --> 00:20:18,853
There is a happy ending here.

318
00:20:19,019 --> 00:20:21,355
From what I saw,
there was like 40 of them.

319
00:20:22,731 --> 00:20:25,025
And that's just what's on the books.

320
00:20:25,192 --> 00:20:28,988
I don't want to know about it.
I never wanna know about it.

321
00:20:29,155 --> 00:20:31,490
- Okay, we'll change the subject.
- Thank you.

322
00:20:31,657 --> 00:20:34,743
- How did it go at Jake's school?
- I don't want to talk about it.

323
00:20:34,910 --> 00:20:36,704
I never wanna talk about it.

324
00:20:36,871 --> 00:20:40,499
- You screwed up, huh?
- ln ways you can't imagine.

325
00:20:40,708 --> 00:20:42,084
So he's expelled?

326
00:20:42,293 --> 00:20:44,753
No, he's just suspended
for the week.

327
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:47,715
That's not so bad.
It's already Wednesday.

328
00:20:47,882 --> 00:20:49,800
I have been asked never to set foot...

329
00:20:49,967 --> 00:20:52,761
on the grounds of Woodward
Avenue Elementary School.

330
00:20:52,928 --> 00:20:54,680
- No kidding.
- And it was suggested...

331
00:20:54,847 --> 00:20:56,807
that I resign from the PT A.

332
00:20:56,974 --> 00:20:59,059
And there's talk of a civil suit.

333
00:20:59,226 --> 00:21:01,145
Principal Gallagher's lesbian lover...

334
00:21:01,312 --> 00:21:03,898
might just drop by tonight
to kick my ass.

335
00:21:04,064 --> 00:21:05,774
Remind me to charge the camcorder.

336
00:21:06,901 --> 00:21:09,028
Oh, click, another great business idea.

337
00:21:09,194 --> 00:21:10,988
- I don't wanna hear it.
- Just listen.

338
00:21:11,155 --> 00:21:13,449
We put a massage table
in the trunk of your car.

339
00:21:13,616 --> 00:21:15,826
- Forget it, Charlie.
- We'd probably need a van.

340
00:21:15,993 --> 00:21:17,661
- I'm not listening.
