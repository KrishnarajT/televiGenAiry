1
00:00:05,228 --> 00:00:08,732
Well, that was just lovely.

2
00:00:09,483 --> 00:00:11,026
I do aim to please.

3
00:00:11,193 --> 00:00:14,946
And after last time,
I appreciate the aiming.

4
00:00:15,822 --> 00:00:19,659
Hey, we made good time.
I can let the babysitter go early.

5
00:00:19,826 --> 00:00:21,536
The key is efficient foreplay.

6
00:00:21,703 --> 00:00:26,708
Minimal attention to each breast
before I meander to your dander.

7
00:00:28,335 --> 00:00:30,420
- Spoon?
- Sure.

8
00:00:38,011 --> 00:00:40,097
And switch.

9
00:00:47,062 --> 00:00:49,356
- That was fun.
- It always is.

10
00:00:49,523 --> 00:00:51,441
Okay, well, drive safe.

11
00:00:51,608 --> 00:00:53,860
- I always do.
- I know, I'm just a worrier.

12
00:00:54,027 --> 00:00:55,695
I know you are.

13
00:00:56,071 --> 00:00:58,031
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

14
00:01:01,952 --> 00:01:04,371
I get more tongue from my butcher.

15
00:01:09,292 --> 00:01:12,045
I'm sorry, did you consider
making your presence known?

16
00:01:12,212 --> 00:01:14,089
Clear your throat, maybe a little cough?

17
00:01:14,256 --> 00:01:17,926
I wanted to vomit, but I was
afraid it might break the mood.

18
00:01:18,093 --> 00:01:21,221
Hey, hey. Postcoital kissing
is always more platonic.

19
00:01:21,388 --> 00:01:23,723
- Is it?
- Yes, because, well...

20
00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:26,059
we both know
where our mouths have been.

21
00:01:26,309 --> 00:01:27,352
I see.

22
00:01:27,519 --> 00:01:30,188
But in the bedroom,
there was a lot of saliva...

23
00:01:30,355 --> 00:01:32,899
and heat, and friction,
believe you me.

24
00:01:33,233 --> 00:01:36,278
- Really?
- Yes, really.

25
00:01:39,239 --> 00:01:41,324
It may not have been
crazy, hot, monkey sex...

26
00:01:41,491 --> 00:01:43,243
like when we first started dating.

27
00:01:43,410 --> 00:01:48,039
But it was very much in the
general category of jungle humping.

28
00:01:48,832 --> 00:01:50,959
- Jungle humping?
- Yes.

29
00:01:51,126 --> 00:01:52,627
Maybe not tree swinging...

30
00:01:52,794 --> 00:01:56,256
but certainly canoodling
on some low-hanging branches.

31
00:01:56,423 --> 00:01:58,550
You poor bastard.

32
00:01:58,717 --> 00:02:00,802
Don't you dare feel sorry for me.

33
00:02:00,969 --> 00:02:03,638
This is what an adult relationship
looks like, Charlie.

34
00:02:03,805 --> 00:02:06,600
People get comfortable with each other
and develop a routine.

35
00:02:06,766 --> 00:02:09,060
And if it's not always fireworks
and explosions...

36
00:02:09,227 --> 00:02:13,189
well, that's a reasonable trade
for a warm, collegial partnership.

37
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:18,194
You poor, poor bastard.

38
00:02:18,486 --> 00:02:20,572
This conversation is over.

39
00:02:20,739 --> 00:02:21,948
If only.

40
00:02:24,618 --> 00:02:26,536
Okay, it's boring. It's suffocating.

41
00:02:26,703 --> 00:02:29,247
It's a deathwatch,
but what choice do I have, Charlie?

42
00:02:29,414 --> 00:02:30,749
Pretend I'm you? I'm not you.

43
00:02:30,916 --> 00:02:33,835
I'm monogamous, settle-down guy
who hangs onto a relationship...

44
00:02:34,002 --> 00:02:37,464
until I'm looking at divorce papers
or the pointy end of a steak knife.

45
00:02:37,631 --> 00:02:39,174
Oh, that's a load of crap.

46
00:02:39,341 --> 00:02:43,470
You're afraid if you let go of these
broads you're never gonna get laid again.

47
00:02:43,637 --> 00:02:46,014
Didn't I just say that?

48
00:02:56,942 --> 00:02:59,278
Boxing sucks.

49
00:02:59,695 --> 00:03:02,448
As always,
you're entitled to your stupid opinion.

50
00:03:05,117 --> 00:03:07,870
Why are you making it personal?
I didn't make it personal.

51
00:03:09,705 --> 00:03:11,540
In Ultimate Fighting, they kick, elbow.

52
00:03:11,707 --> 00:03:14,126
They get a guy down
and smash his head in the floor.

53
00:03:14,293 --> 00:03:17,129
These guys just dance around
and barely hit each other.

54
00:03:17,296 --> 00:03:19,048
Okay, okay, listen to me.

55
00:03:19,215 --> 00:03:21,133
Boxing is a science.

56
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:23,177
Boxers don't just
whale on each other...

57
00:03:23,344 --> 00:03:26,472
they strategize, feel each other out,
wait for an opening.

58
00:03:29,141 --> 00:03:30,684
Gay.

59
00:03:33,145 --> 00:03:35,439
And what's with the little pillows
on their hands?

60
00:03:35,606 --> 00:03:38,150
Even if they hit each other,
it wouldn't hurt.

61
00:03:42,738 --> 00:03:43,781
Oh, does that hurt?

62
00:03:43,948 --> 00:03:46,075
- Yeah.
- Good.

63
00:03:47,326 --> 00:03:49,662
- Hey, what are you doing?
- Uncle Charlie hit me.

64
00:03:49,829 --> 00:03:51,247
Good.

65
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:54,667
- Where have you been?
- I'll tell you later.

66
00:03:54,834 --> 00:03:57,920
Tell him now, I got better things to do.

67
00:03:59,797 --> 00:04:01,966
You promised he'd grow on me.

68
00:04:02,508 --> 00:04:04,176
I lied.

69
00:04:05,344 --> 00:04:08,431
- So where were you?
- Well, I thought about what you said...

70
00:04:08,597 --> 00:04:12,017
and I went over to Donna's house
to break up with her.

71
00:04:12,434 --> 00:04:14,770
- I'm proud of you.
- Thanks.

72
00:04:15,813 --> 00:04:18,357
I'm gonna meet her parents
next weekend.

73
00:04:19,441 --> 00:04:21,777
- But you just said...
- I know, but I couldn't do it.

74
00:04:21,944 --> 00:04:24,989
I'm not capable
of rejecting another human being.

75
00:04:25,281 --> 00:04:29,034
Wow, I'd think after all these years,
you'd wanna get even.

76
00:04:30,911 --> 00:04:32,329
I am in trouble here, Charlie.

77
00:04:32,496 --> 00:04:35,124
How do I get out of a stagnant,
joyless relationship?

78
00:04:35,541 --> 00:04:38,669
If I knew how to do that,
you wouldn't still be living here.

79
00:04:43,048 --> 00:04:45,467
Okay, first...

80
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:49,805
you gotta get your mind right.
- How do I do that?

81
00:04:49,972 --> 00:04:53,184
Close your eyes
and imagine a parallel world...

82
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:56,812
where there's an Alan Harper
exactly like you.

83
00:04:56,979 --> 00:05:00,399
Except he's got a set of balls.

84
00:05:04,528 --> 00:05:07,907
- You wanna help me here or not?
- Hey, it's gotta be fun for me too.

85
00:05:10,618 --> 00:05:13,078
Fine. We'll just assume
that your mind is right.

86
00:05:14,705 --> 00:05:18,667
Now, before you do the actual dumping,
there's a few things you gotta consider.

87
00:05:18,834 --> 00:05:20,419
Like what?

88
00:05:20,586 --> 00:05:24,089
Does she have embarrassing photographs
that could wind up on the Internet...

89
00:05:24,256 --> 00:05:25,424
if she takes it badly?

90
00:05:25,591 --> 00:05:27,343
I'm not sure.

91
00:05:27,676 --> 00:05:28,928
What do you mean?

92
00:05:29,094 --> 00:05:32,222
Well, there's one of me naked,
but I'm wearing a mask and a cape.

93
00:05:32,389 --> 00:05:36,268
- I thought the sex was mundane.
- Sadly, it still was.

94
00:05:37,645 --> 00:05:39,355
Whatever, she can't use the picture.

95
00:05:39,521 --> 00:05:41,607
Does she have your
credit card information?

96
00:05:41,774 --> 00:05:44,068
- No.
- Don't answer so quickly.

97
00:05:44,693 --> 00:05:48,656
I once handed a date my Visa
so she could pump gas for me...

98
00:05:49,031 --> 00:05:51,408
and on my next statement
there were charges...

99
00:05:51,575 --> 00:05:53,494
for a boob job and a PlayStation 3.

100
00:05:54,495 --> 00:05:57,122
And I never got to play
with either one of them.

101
00:05:58,957 --> 00:06:00,876
You made your date pump gas?

102
00:06:01,293 --> 00:06:03,754
I liked the song that was on the radio.

103
00:06:04,588 --> 00:06:08,050
But back to the topic at hand.
Does she own any chick weapons?

104
00:06:08,217 --> 00:06:09,468
Chick weapons?

105
00:06:09,635 --> 00:06:13,222
You know, little guns, Tasers,
pepper spray.

106
00:06:13,389 --> 00:06:15,641
Well, there's a baseball bat
by her front door...

107
00:06:15,808 --> 00:06:17,893
but I think that's for intruders.

108
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:20,979
Yeah, I've made that mistake too.

109
00:06:23,482 --> 00:06:27,611
Okay. Let's talk about
the where, when and how.

110
00:06:28,362 --> 00:06:32,074
Where: Always break up in public place.
That way you avoid having a scene.

111
00:06:32,241 --> 00:06:33,534
- That makes sense.
- When:

112
00:06:33,701 --> 00:06:36,912
Before the desert menu comes out.
Otherwise, you can find yourself...

113
00:06:37,079 --> 00:06:40,374
with a lap full of hot coffee,
which is not as fun as it sounds.

114
00:06:40,541 --> 00:06:41,667
That doesn't sound fun.

115
00:06:41,834 --> 00:06:44,420
It sounds fun if you're
wearing a couple of doughnuts.

116
00:06:49,591 --> 00:06:51,176
Moving on to how.

117
00:06:53,178 --> 00:06:54,680
What you wanna convey...

118
00:06:54,847 --> 00:06:58,517
is your undying affection and
gratitude for your time spent together...

119
00:06:58,684 --> 00:07:02,104
coupled with your need for space
to find out who you really are.

120
00:07:02,271 --> 00:07:04,022
- But that's crap.
- It's all crap.

121
00:07:04,189 --> 00:07:06,275
You know it, she knows it,
everybody knows it.

122
00:07:06,692 --> 00:07:07,943
All we're trying to do...

123
00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:10,863
is keep her from taking batting
practice on your kidneys.

124
00:07:11,029 --> 00:07:12,489
Why would she go for my kidneys?

125
00:07:12,656 --> 00:07:15,200
Because you'll be running away
covering your head.

126
00:07:15,367 --> 00:07:19,872
Okay, okay. So I take her to dinner,
and then before the coffee comes...

127
00:07:20,038 --> 00:07:22,708
I tell her that
while I have strong feelings for her...

128
00:07:22,875 --> 00:07:24,877
I need time to find out
who I really am.

129
00:07:25,294 --> 00:07:26,378
Excellent.

130
00:07:26,545 --> 00:07:30,132
Maybe I could throw in some stuff about
how I'm still reeling from my divorce.

131
00:07:30,299 --> 00:07:32,843
Don't improvise.
You don't have the chops for it.

132
00:07:33,886 --> 00:07:35,679
- Sorry.
- No problem.

133
00:07:35,846 --> 00:07:39,474
- I do appreciate the advice.
- You're very welcome.

134
00:07:47,649 --> 00:07:50,152
A mask and a cape,
and the sex was boring?

135
00:07:50,569 --> 00:07:53,989
What can I say?
She still knew it was me.

136
00:08:00,913 --> 00:08:02,331
How do I look?

137
00:08:03,248 --> 00:08:05,500
What difference does it make?
You're breaking up.

138
00:08:05,667 --> 00:08:08,837
I don't want my clothes to say
"come hither."

139
00:08:09,004 --> 00:08:13,008
Don't worry. As always, they say
"your regular teacher is sick."

140
00:08:15,761 --> 00:08:17,846
- Are we clear on everything I told you?
- Yes.

141
00:08:18,013 --> 00:08:21,308
I'm gonna go to her house, pick her up,
take her to the restaurant...

142
00:08:22,226 --> 00:08:25,062
Pick her up?
You're supposed to meet her there.

143
00:08:25,229 --> 00:08:27,606
- Why?
- What do you mean, why?

144
00:08:27,773 --> 00:08:30,484
You're gonna break up with her
and then drive her home?

145
00:08:31,443 --> 00:08:34,029
You'll need the Jaws of Life
to get her out of your car.

146
00:08:34,196 --> 00:08:37,741
- You didn't say anything about that.
- It's common sense.

147
00:08:37,908 --> 00:08:42,162
Do you know why Custer and Sitting Bull
didn't share a pony to Little Bighorn?

148
00:08:42,454 --> 00:08:44,539
They knew
there were gonna be hurt feelings...

149
00:08:44,706 --> 00:08:47,042
and the ride home
would be awkward.

150
00:08:47,793 --> 00:08:51,129
- I'm just gonna call her and reschedule.
- No, no, no, you're not.

151
00:08:51,296 --> 00:08:52,422
Here's what you do.

152
00:08:52,589 --> 00:08:54,800
You're gonna pick her up,
have a nice dinner...

153
00:08:54,967 --> 00:08:57,135
drive her home
and walk her to her door.

154
00:08:57,302 --> 00:08:59,972
- What if she asks me in?
- No, never go inside.

155
00:09:01,556 --> 00:09:04,142
Everything in her house
is a potential weapon.

156
00:09:04,851 --> 00:09:05,978
Everything?

157
00:09:06,144 --> 00:09:08,772
I was once blinded for two days
by potpourri.

158
00:09:11,608 --> 00:09:16,196
So you just walk her to her door...

159
00:09:16,363 --> 00:09:18,073
take her by the hand...

160
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,492
and tell her
that you've had wonderful times...

161
00:09:20,659 --> 00:09:22,828
and those are the memories
you will cherish.

162
00:09:22,994 --> 00:09:25,706
You know, we did have
wonderful times.

163
00:09:25,872 --> 00:09:30,168
Hiking in Catalina,
go-carting in Oxnard...

164
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:32,504
Oktoberfest in Rosemead.

165
00:09:34,005 --> 00:09:37,092
What a day that was.
Sharing bratwurst and sauerkraut...

166
00:09:37,259 --> 00:09:40,303
while listening
to the battle of the oompah bands.

167
00:09:41,012 --> 00:09:43,014
Oh, God.
Do you think I'm making a mistake?

168
00:09:43,181 --> 00:09:47,853
No, no, no. The mind plays tricks on us.
It only remembers the good times.

169
00:09:48,019 --> 00:09:51,022
Or in your case,
the creepy, pathetic times.

170
00:09:51,732 --> 00:09:54,317
- But I still...
- Don't worry, Alan.

171
00:09:54,484 --> 00:09:57,028
There'll be other broads
to share your bratwurst with.

172
00:09:58,613 --> 00:10:00,323
You're right, I have to do this.

173
00:10:02,868 --> 00:10:06,037
But wait, what...?
What if she starts crying?

174
00:10:06,204 --> 00:10:10,208
You hold her in your arms, whisper
that this is best for both of you...

175
00:10:10,375 --> 00:10:12,711
then turn around
and walk away like a man.

176
00:10:13,879 --> 00:10:18,049
Unless you hear a distinct
metallic click, then zigzag and roll.

177
00:10:30,645 --> 00:10:32,314
Hi. Come on in.

178
00:10:34,024 --> 00:10:36,401
That's okay, I'm kind of hungry.
Let's just go.

179
00:10:36,568 --> 00:10:39,196
Well, actually,
I thought we could stay in tonight.

180
00:10:39,738 --> 00:10:41,781
- Really?
- I'm making fondue.

181
00:10:41,948 --> 00:10:44,910
- Come on.
- Oh, goody.

182
00:10:45,076 --> 00:10:47,370
Hot cheese and long, sharp forks.

183
00:11:08,293 --> 00:11:11,088
This movie is stupid.

184
00:11:12,422 --> 00:11:14,299
This movie is a classic.

185
00:11:14,466 --> 00:11:18,137
It's been 40 minutes and we
haven't even seen the shark yet.

186
00:11:18,303 --> 00:11:22,224
That's because they're building suspense,
letting you use your imagination.

187
00:11:22,391 --> 00:11:26,019
You know what I'm imagining?
A better movie.

188
00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:29,940
- It's a classic, Jake.
- I'll tell you what's a classic.

189
00:11:30,107 --> 00:11:31,441
Snakes on a Plane.

190
00:11:32,025 --> 00:11:35,028
First, you're in an airplane,
which is scary to begin with...

191
00:11:35,195 --> 00:11:37,072
and then it's all filled with snakes.

192
00:11:37,239 --> 00:11:38,740
And they're everywhere.

193
00:11:38,907 --> 00:11:42,494
They're in the overhead compartments,
in the bathrooms, in the vomit bags.

194
00:11:44,204 --> 00:11:46,874
You need to throw up,
open the bag, snake.

195
00:11:47,332 --> 00:11:49,293
Sounds gripping.

196
00:11:49,459 --> 00:11:51,253
Snake.

197
00:11:58,135 --> 00:11:59,678
Snake.

198
00:12:01,555 --> 00:12:04,600
- That's it. We're out of here.
- Where are we going?

199
00:12:04,766 --> 00:12:08,103
Someplace public, where killing you
would get me in trouble.

200
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:09,771
Fine.

201
00:12:09,938 --> 00:12:11,565
Snake.

202
00:12:13,191 --> 00:12:15,068
- Great fondue, Donna.
- Glad you liked it.

203
00:12:15,235 --> 00:12:17,988
Oh, don't forget
to put away the little forks.

204
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:21,325
Thanks. Be right back.

205
00:12:28,123 --> 00:12:30,083
Oh, good Lord.

206
00:12:33,837 --> 00:12:35,797
We've had wonderful times together,
Donna.

207
00:12:35,964 --> 00:12:38,592
And those are memories
I will always cherish.

208
00:12:38,759 --> 00:12:40,802
- What?
- Nothing.

209
00:12:44,681 --> 00:12:46,558
The potpourri.

210
00:12:59,529 --> 00:13:00,822
I made coffee.

211
00:13:01,198 --> 00:13:03,575
- Hot coffee?
- Well, yeah.

212
00:13:04,076 --> 00:13:05,702
Of course it's hot.

213
00:13:07,704 --> 00:13:11,249
Oh, my. That is potentially scalding.

214
00:13:11,416 --> 00:13:14,753
- Blow on it, silly.
- Yes, blowing.

215
00:13:16,004 --> 00:13:17,422
You blow too.

216
00:13:19,549 --> 00:13:23,553
So listen, Donna, there's something
we really need to talk about.

217
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:27,391
- What's that?
- Well, I was wondering.

218
00:13:27,974 --> 00:13:31,603
Are you completely happy
in this relationship?

219
00:13:31,770 --> 00:13:34,981
- Oh, good, then it's not just me.
- What do you mean?

220
00:13:35,148 --> 00:13:37,567
Well, I enjoy spending time with you...

221
00:13:37,734 --> 00:13:41,113
but, honey, I kind of feel
like we're getting a little stale.

222
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:43,532
Really? I thought it was going great.

223
00:13:43,698 --> 00:13:48,578
Come on, Alan. Our sex life is pathetic.
We're just going through the motions.

224
00:13:48,745 --> 00:13:51,998
Well, now, hold on.
Those motions are tried and true.

225
00:13:52,165 --> 00:13:55,127
Call it whatever you want.
Tried and true, dull and listless.

226
00:13:55,293 --> 00:13:57,462
I wanna call it tried and true.

227
00:13:57,629 --> 00:14:01,216
All I know is every time we get in bed,
it's the same old thing.

228
00:14:01,383 --> 00:14:04,010
The same old thing?
What about the mask and cape?

229
00:14:04,428 --> 00:14:07,806
It was the same old thing
in a mask and cape.

230
00:14:07,973 --> 00:14:09,516
Please don't take it personally.

231
00:14:09,683 --> 00:14:11,935
Oh, no. How can I possibly
take it personally?

232
00:14:12,102 --> 00:14:15,147
- You're just telling me I'm a lousy lay.
- No, I didn't mean lousy.

233
00:14:15,313 --> 00:14:19,234
I meant uninspired, lackluster,
predictable.

234
00:14:19,401 --> 00:14:23,029
- Okay.
- Tedious, mind-numbing, boring...

235
00:14:23,196 --> 00:14:25,407
All right, that's it.
Come upstairs with me.

236
00:14:25,574 --> 00:14:28,535
I will show you tedious,
mind-numbing and boring.

237
00:14:29,035 --> 00:14:30,328
Oh, God. I'm sorry.

238
00:14:30,495 --> 00:14:32,581
- Hot, hot, hot.
- What can I do?

239
00:14:32,747 --> 00:14:35,125
I don't know, just do something.

240
00:14:45,594 --> 00:14:48,096
How can you say this is boring?

241
00:14:49,723 --> 00:14:52,184
Wait till you try this.
It's the best pizza in town.

242
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:54,895
- Says who?
- They put a flyer on Mom's windshield.

243
00:14:55,061 --> 00:14:56,605
It said "best pizza in town."

244
00:14:57,147 --> 00:14:59,649
Jake, let me give you
a little culinary advice.

245
00:14:59,816 --> 00:15:02,027
Any restaurant
that advertises on windshields...

246
00:15:02,194 --> 00:15:06,364
and has a guy dressed as a hoagie
is probably not the best in town.

247
00:15:06,531 --> 00:15:09,576
He wasn't a hoagie, he was a calzone.

248
00:15:16,374 --> 00:15:18,126
- Amazing.
- What?

249
00:15:18,293 --> 00:15:20,962
How can a kid with such
lousy taste in pizza and movies...

250
00:15:21,129 --> 00:15:23,131
have such good taste in girls?

251
00:15:24,674 --> 00:15:27,093
- She is kind of cute.
- Why don't you go talk to her?

252
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:28,553
I don't know what to say.

253
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:31,556
That's never stopped you
from running your mouth before.

254
00:15:33,475 --> 00:15:36,353
- What about her mom?
- Just stick with the daughter for now.

255
00:15:36,519 --> 00:15:38,813
- No, I mean...
- I know what you mean.

256
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:41,858
Tell you what. I'll be your wingman.

257
00:15:42,025 --> 00:15:44,402
I'll go over
and engage the mom in conversation.

258
00:15:44,569 --> 00:15:47,113
Then after I grease the wheels,
I'll give you a signal.

259
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:49,157
You saunter over and work your magic.

260
00:15:49,324 --> 00:15:51,660
- Saunter?
- Walk.

261
00:15:51,826 --> 00:15:54,621
Well, then just say walk.
You don't have to make up words.

262
00:15:57,374 --> 00:15:59,250
Wait, what's the signal?

263
00:15:59,751 --> 00:16:03,254
- I don't know, I'll give you a thumbs up.
- That's not much of a signal.

264
00:16:03,421 --> 00:16:06,508
All right, how about I just wave my arms
and say, "Yo, dumb-ass."

265
00:16:07,092 --> 00:16:09,094
Let's go with the thumb.

266
00:16:14,099 --> 00:16:16,434
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

267
00:16:16,601 --> 00:16:20,271
I'm sorry to interrupt your dinner, but
I'm sitting over there with my nephew...

268
00:16:20,438 --> 00:16:22,732
- Now?
- No, not now.

269
00:16:23,525 --> 00:16:25,360
- Dumb-ass.
- Now?

270
00:16:26,861 --> 00:16:28,655
No.

271
00:16:28,822 --> 00:16:31,533
Anyway, he's taken a bit of a shine
to your daughter...

272
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:35,203
and it would mean the world to him
if he could come over and meet her.

273
00:16:35,704 --> 00:16:38,623
That's very sweet,
and I don't wanna seem impolite...

274
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:41,209
but this is our one-on-one time.

275
00:16:41,376 --> 00:16:44,838
I understand. You should have that.
We're only talking a couple of minutes.

276
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:47,924
- Enough time to put a smile on a boy's...
- Now?

277
00:16:48,675 --> 00:16:50,427
No.

278
00:16:51,970 --> 00:16:56,182
Look, I appreciate you coming over,
but I think we'll pass.

279
00:16:56,349 --> 00:16:59,269
Fine. Sorry to bother you.

280
00:16:59,853 --> 00:17:01,688
Real smooth.

281
00:17:04,858 --> 00:17:06,818
Okay, you really gotta
help me out here.

282
00:17:06,985 --> 00:17:10,447
- Sir, I'm having dinner with my daughter.
- And I am here with my nephew.

283
00:17:10,613 --> 00:17:12,532
They'd rather be sitting and talking...

284
00:17:12,699 --> 00:17:15,243
than hanging out
with a couple of old farts like us.

285
00:17:15,785 --> 00:17:19,372
- What did you call me?
- No, no, no. Not you, us.

286
00:17:19,539 --> 00:17:20,832
I was being funny.

287
00:17:22,083 --> 00:17:24,669
I don't think you're funny at all.

288
00:17:24,836 --> 00:17:28,882
Well, clearly you don't know me.
I'm Charlie.

289
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:32,802
Yes, well, Charlie,
I've asked you to leave us alone.

290
00:17:32,969 --> 00:17:35,972
- I understand, and I will, but...
- Honey, get me a refill.

291
00:17:36,598 --> 00:17:38,141
Yo, dumb-ass. Go get a refill.

292
00:17:38,308 --> 00:17:39,767
- Now?
- Yes, now.

293
00:17:41,978 --> 00:17:43,897
My brother's kid's not real...

294
00:17:48,818 --> 00:17:52,822
- I warned you.
- God, it's worse than the potpourri.

295
00:17:56,326 --> 00:17:57,785
I see you like the diet cola.

296
00:17:57,952 --> 00:18:00,830
If I may say so,
you don't need to watch your weight.

297
00:18:05,501 --> 00:18:08,963
- Here you go. Clean and dry.
- Thank you, thank you.

298
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:12,383
- Are you all right?
- Oh, yeah. Little Alan's fine.

299
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:14,886
The twins got the worst of it.

300
00:18:15,303 --> 00:18:16,679
Good, good.

301
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:20,808
Listen, Donna. You were right.

302
00:18:20,975 --> 00:18:23,686
- This relationship is over.
- Over?

303
00:18:23,853 --> 00:18:26,564
Well, what else is there to do
besides call it quits?

304
00:18:26,731 --> 00:18:29,734
Oh, I thought maybe
we could take it to the next level.

305
00:18:30,526 --> 00:18:31,569
Next level?

306
00:18:31,736 --> 00:18:33,988
What's beyond mind-numbing,
tedious and boring?

307
00:18:35,198 --> 00:18:37,784
I'll tell you what's beyond it. Death.

308
00:18:38,076 --> 00:18:39,786
No, thank you. Already been married.

309
00:18:39,953 --> 00:18:41,788
- But, Alan...
- I'm sorry, but it's just...

310
00:18:41,955 --> 00:18:43,873
It's time we faced the truth. L...

311
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:46,125
I have no romantic feelings
for you anymore.

312
00:18:46,709 --> 00:18:49,295
- None?
- None at all.

313
00:18:52,215 --> 00:18:53,383
Come on, Donna.

314
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:55,635
Crying doesn't solve anything.
Believe me.

315
00:18:55,802 --> 00:18:58,721
It's better to end this now
while we're still friends.

316
00:19:04,852 --> 00:19:07,939
- Goodbye, my friend.
- Oh, just get out.

317
00:19:24,914 --> 00:19:28,209
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

318
00:19:29,752 --> 00:19:32,964
- Oh, hi. You must be Alan.
- Yes.

319
00:19:33,715 --> 00:19:36,759
Forget it, Georgia.
It's not gonna happen.

320
00:19:43,266 --> 00:19:44,934
What's not gonna happen?

321
00:19:45,101 --> 00:19:49,731
I thought I could spice up our
relationship with a three-way.

322
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:54,485
A three-way?

323
00:19:54,652 --> 00:19:58,781
But I didn't realize you had
no romantic feelings for me at all.

324
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:01,409
Now, hang on.

325
00:20:03,077 --> 00:20:05,371
I think you may have misinterpreted
my remarks.

326
00:20:05,538 --> 00:20:08,082
Oh, honey. I'm here for you.

327
00:20:08,249 --> 00:20:11,294
Now, see, you really need to be
more clear about what you meant...

328
00:20:11,461 --> 00:20:13,129
by taking it to the next level.

329
00:20:13,296 --> 00:20:15,673
See, I'm fine with this.

330
00:20:16,090 --> 00:20:20,052
- This could help.
- Oh, go to hell.

331
00:20:44,595 --> 00:20:46,221
Was the friend good-Iooking?

332
00:20:46,805 --> 00:20:49,266
Spectacular.

333
00:20:50,767 --> 00:20:54,104
Sounds like you blew what could have
been the best night of your life.

334
00:20:54,271 --> 00:20:57,941
The best night? No, no.
That was the night Jake was born.

335
00:20:58,317 --> 00:21:01,153
You have a three-way
the night Jake was born?

336
00:21:01,695 --> 00:21:04,489
Okay, I blew the best night of my life.

337
00:21:04,906 --> 00:21:07,826
Well, don't worry. You'll have
another opportunity someday.

338
00:21:07,993 --> 00:21:10,954
- How do you figure?
- You may have to wait a few decades.

339
00:21:11,121 --> 00:21:16,585
But I hear the ratio of gals to geezers
in senior-living facilities is two-to-one.

340
00:21:17,627 --> 00:21:21,298
Imagine the progress they'll have made
in boner pills by that time.

341
00:21:23,633 --> 00:21:25,677
Are you staring at me?

342
00:21:26,887 --> 00:21:30,098
Because it feels like
you're staring at me.
