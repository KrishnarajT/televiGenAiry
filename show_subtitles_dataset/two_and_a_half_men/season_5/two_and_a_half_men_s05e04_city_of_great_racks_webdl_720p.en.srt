1
00:00:01,478 --> 00:00:04,523
- Thank you for a lovely dinner.
- You're welcome.

2
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:11,738
- Good night.
- Wait, wait, wait.

3
00:00:11,905 --> 00:00:14,324
Are you sure
you don't want me to tuck you in?

4
00:00:14,491 --> 00:00:16,702
I don't need to be tucked, Charlie.

5
00:00:16,868 --> 00:00:20,539
Oh, come on, everybody needs
a good tucking once in a while.

6
00:00:20,706 --> 00:00:23,750
Well, then, go tuck yourself.

7
00:00:23,917 --> 00:00:25,877
I guess I'll have to.

8
00:00:29,131 --> 00:00:32,301
I'm not saying no.
I'm just saying not now.

9
00:00:32,801 --> 00:00:33,885
I understand.

10
00:00:34,303 --> 00:00:36,638
- Good night.
- Good night.

11
00:00:40,058 --> 00:00:41,393
How about now?

12
00:00:42,311 --> 00:00:43,895
Funny.

13
00:00:46,565 --> 00:00:48,859
I wasn't going for a laugh.

14
00:00:52,863 --> 00:00:53,905
Come on, Luther.

15
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:58,744
Rose?

16
00:00:59,619 --> 00:01:02,080
No, it couldn't be.

17
00:01:02,998 --> 00:01:06,543
I'm so backed up I'm literally cockeyed.

18
00:01:15,453 --> 00:01:17,705
Hot girl at 12 o'clock.

19
00:01:21,042 --> 00:01:24,128
- Where?
- Over there.

20
00:01:27,131 --> 00:01:29,467
That would be 9 o'clock.

21
00:01:29,634 --> 00:01:32,971
No, it's 12. Actually, 12:05.

22
00:01:33,137 --> 00:01:34,472
Twelve-ish.

23
00:01:36,057 --> 00:01:39,018
- Wanna straighten him out or should I?
- Go ahead, take a swing.

24
00:01:39,185 --> 00:01:43,523
Okay. The reason guys say
hot girl at like 12 o'clock or 3 o'clock...

25
00:01:43,690 --> 00:01:47,402
is to specify a location
using the clock face as kind of a map.

26
00:01:47,568 --> 00:01:49,320
What if you have a digital watch?

27
00:01:50,738 --> 00:01:54,158
First of all, you're not gonna meet
any women if you wear a digital watch.

28
00:01:54,325 --> 00:01:57,245
Second of all, it doesn't matter.
The clock face is imaginary.

29
00:01:57,412 --> 00:01:59,497
How do you know
what time you saw the girl?

30
00:02:00,665 --> 00:02:02,208
Oh, my God.

31
00:02:02,375 --> 00:02:06,671
You know what? I'm wrong.
There's a hot girl and it's 12:06.

32
00:02:07,171 --> 00:02:08,506
Check.

33
00:02:10,007 --> 00:02:14,178
Hey, he likes girls and he can tell time.
I'm a happy dad.

34
00:02:19,392 --> 00:02:21,602
- Hello, Your Honor, what's up?
- Your Honor?

35
00:02:21,769 --> 00:02:24,522
Oh, your uncle's dating a judge.

36
00:02:24,689 --> 00:02:27,024
This weekend? Sure, that sounds great.

37
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:30,695
- You mean like an American Idol judge?
- No, a real judge.

38
00:02:30,862 --> 00:02:33,364
American Idol judges are real, Dad.

39
00:02:35,116 --> 00:02:37,410
So, what,
we'd be staying in adjoining rooms?

40
00:02:37,577 --> 00:02:40,288
- No, no, no, one room is fine.
- Why is he dating a judge?

41
00:02:40,455 --> 00:02:42,540
- Is he trying to get out of something?
- No.

42
00:02:42,707 --> 00:02:44,876
More like he's trying
to get into something.

43
00:02:45,042 --> 00:02:46,544
Good one.

44
00:02:46,711 --> 00:02:48,629
- You understood that?
- Not really.

45
00:02:48,796 --> 00:02:50,298
That's how I knew it was good.

46
00:02:50,465 --> 00:02:54,427
Oh, yeah, that's a very romantic hotel.
I've stayed there...

47
00:02:54,594 --> 00:02:58,598
Never in my life.
Right. Okay, talk to you later.

48
00:03:00,224 --> 00:03:03,394
Santa Barbara, this weekend, one room.

49
00:03:03,561 --> 00:03:05,605
Oh, now I get it.

50
00:03:06,147 --> 00:03:08,566
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

51
00:03:11,444 --> 00:03:13,446
- Son of a gun, Alan, look.
- What?

52
00:03:13,613 --> 00:03:14,906
- The blond.
- Where?

53
00:03:15,072 --> 00:03:16,949
Twelve-oh-eight.

54
00:03:18,117 --> 00:03:19,243
She looks like Rose.

55
00:03:19,410 --> 00:03:21,579
It couldn't be.
She's still in England, right?

56
00:03:22,246 --> 00:03:25,416
- Last I heard.
- I got a postcard from her the other day.

57
00:03:25,917 --> 00:03:28,211
- Really? What did it say?
- Well, let's see.

58
00:03:28,377 --> 00:03:33,424
"Dear Jake, how are you? I am fine.
Hope you're doing well in school."

59
00:03:33,591 --> 00:03:36,677
I think that's a joke because she knows
I struggle with my grades.

60
00:03:36,844 --> 00:03:40,848
Let's see, what else? Oh, yeah.
"Say hello from England to everybody."

61
00:03:41,474 --> 00:03:42,934
Hello from England.

62
00:03:44,268 --> 00:03:46,312
Well, there you go. She's in England.

63
00:03:46,812 --> 00:03:49,941
I guess.
So why do I keep thinking I see her?

64
00:03:50,107 --> 00:03:53,027
- Maybe you miss her.
- I don't think so.

65
00:03:53,194 --> 00:03:55,988
I was a little down when she left,
which is to be expected...

66
00:03:56,155 --> 00:03:58,282
but I've got Linda now
and I've moved on...

67
00:03:58,449 --> 00:04:00,493
and why am I talking to you
about my life?

68
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:01,953
Because I'm a good listener?

69
00:04:04,413 --> 00:04:06,791
Because you have no other friends?

70
00:04:10,461 --> 00:04:12,797
- We're dropping him off at his mother's?
- Yep.

71
00:04:38,489 --> 00:04:42,535
Dear Charlie,
greetings from faggy old London.

72
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:49,500
Greetings from foggy old London.

73
00:04:50,251 --> 00:04:53,838
Hope you are doing well
and not working too hard.

74
00:04:54,005 --> 00:04:55,506
Things are going great for me.

75
00:04:55,673 --> 00:04:58,759
I love my job and my flat
and my new friends.

76
00:04:58,926 --> 00:05:01,887
Sometimes, my life in Malibu
feels like a crazy dream.

77
00:05:02,346 --> 00:05:04,932
I hope you can forgive me
for all my bizarre behavior...

78
00:05:05,099 --> 00:05:07,560
and know that I will always
remember you fondly.

79
00:05:07,727 --> 00:05:09,812
Your friend, Rose.

80
00:05:09,979 --> 00:05:11,939
P.S., Give my best to Alan.

81
00:05:12,106 --> 00:05:15,276
I'm sure by now
he's found a place of his own.

82
00:05:17,194 --> 00:05:20,448
- What you got there?
- It's a letter from Rose.

83
00:05:20,614 --> 00:05:22,533
Really? That come today?

84
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:25,911
No, a few months ago.
I just never got around to reading it.

85
00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:28,914
I noticed you didn't toss it out.

86
00:05:29,832 --> 00:05:31,792
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Charlie.

87
00:05:31,959 --> 00:05:33,627
Of all the broads who've staggered...

88
00:05:33,794 --> 00:05:35,921
bare-assed
through these hallowed halls...

89
00:05:36,088 --> 00:05:38,048
she's the one who really got to you.

90
00:05:38,591 --> 00:05:40,468
Yeah, she got to me.

91
00:05:40,634 --> 00:05:44,764
She put a sleeping pill in my Scotch
and superglued my testicles to my leg.

92
00:05:45,181 --> 00:05:47,099
You just can't get past that, can you?

93
00:05:48,142 --> 00:05:49,393
Well, it doesn't matter.

94
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:52,271
I'm in a real relationship now
with an incredible woman.

95
00:05:52,438 --> 00:05:54,523
A judge, a constitutional scholar.

96
00:05:54,690 --> 00:05:56,650
A woman who may one day
be a state senator.

97
00:05:57,067 --> 00:05:59,236
But does she care enough
to line her mittens...

98
00:05:59,403 --> 00:06:01,906
with hair she collects
from your shower drain?

99
00:06:02,406 --> 00:06:04,283
I don't know yet. We're going slow.

100
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:06,494
- Really?
- Yes.

101
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:09,580
Getting to know each other as people
before we jump into bed...

102
00:06:09,747 --> 00:06:12,833
and get to know each other
as, you know, animals.

103
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,669
Just do me a favor
and make the first time at her place...

104
00:06:15,836 --> 00:06:19,048
because you're gonna spring forth
like a Water Wiggle.

105
00:07:39,503 --> 00:07:40,713
Charlie?

106
00:07:40,879 --> 00:07:42,506
- Charlie?
- What?

107
00:07:46,510 --> 00:07:48,012
I need your help.

108
00:07:48,554 --> 00:07:52,599
If you're doing laundry,
all I can say is you're doing it wrong.

109
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:57,021
No, no, the lady I've been seeing,
you know, Linda's friend Donna?

110
00:07:57,187 --> 00:08:00,232
She wants to... How shall we say?

111
00:08:00,399 --> 00:08:02,026
Take it up a notch.

112
00:08:02,484 --> 00:08:05,612
- Yeah, so?
- I'm out of notches.

113
00:08:06,447 --> 00:08:09,950
- What do you need?
- A younger man's penis.

114
00:08:11,410 --> 00:08:14,621
My night stand, top drawer,
next to the Ping-Pong paddle.

115
00:08:14,788 --> 00:08:17,041
Take one with water
and stall for 20 minutes.

116
00:08:17,207 --> 00:08:18,250
Thanks.

117
00:08:18,417 --> 00:08:20,377
- Alan?
- Yeah?

118
00:08:20,544 --> 00:08:22,880
- Don't those hurt?
- Hell, yeah.

119
00:08:23,047 --> 00:08:26,216
- Why don't you take them off?
- There's a penalty involved.

120
00:08:27,926 --> 00:08:29,720
Long story.

121
00:08:31,722 --> 00:08:34,433
I can tell you how it ends.

122
00:08:41,607 --> 00:08:45,986
- Lovely dinner.
- Yeah. Food was great.

123
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:51,241
- It's a beautiful room.
- Yeah. Room's great.

124
00:08:52,493 --> 00:08:54,203
Nice view.

125
00:08:55,078 --> 00:08:57,289
Yep, view's great.

126
00:09:07,758 --> 00:09:09,802
Oh, for God's sake.

127
00:09:09,968 --> 00:09:12,346
- Who is it?
- Room service, señor.

128
00:09:13,096 --> 00:09:14,598
We didn't order anything.

129
00:09:14,765 --> 00:09:18,060
It's champagne.
Compliments of the hotel.

130
00:09:18,602 --> 00:09:21,647
- Can you slip it under the door?
- Charlie.

131
00:09:23,273 --> 00:09:25,943
Don't move. Don't change your mind.

132
00:09:35,285 --> 00:09:37,538
- Do you want I open?
- No, thank you.

133
00:09:37,955 --> 00:09:39,957
Okay, good night.

134
00:09:53,512 --> 00:09:54,555
Charlie.

135
00:09:55,472 --> 00:09:58,600
- Yeah?
- I'm waiting.

136
00:09:58,976 --> 00:10:00,477
For what?

137
00:10:01,478 --> 00:10:03,230
Oh, right.

138
00:10:04,898 --> 00:10:06,525
Hang on.

139
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:13,240
What are you doing to the rose?

140
00:10:13,532 --> 00:10:16,368
I just don't want it looking at me.

141
00:10:28,239 --> 00:10:31,284
- Anything interesting going on in school?
- I started algebra.

142
00:10:31,451 --> 00:10:32,619
Oh, how's that going?

143
00:10:32,785 --> 00:10:35,955
I don't get it at all,
but the teacher's really hot.

144
00:10:37,248 --> 00:10:41,419
- Well, that's nice.
- Yeah, she's got some really great racks.

145
00:10:43,087 --> 00:10:44,714
I think you mean rack.

146
00:10:44,881 --> 00:10:47,467
No, she's got two,
and they're ginormous.

147
00:10:49,802 --> 00:10:52,805
It's kind of cool
that she's teaching algebra.

148
00:10:55,475 --> 00:10:57,143
Nothing?

149
00:10:57,644 --> 00:10:59,729
Boy, that killed in detention.

150
00:11:00,146 --> 00:11:04,484
- Oh, hey, how was Santa Barbara?
- Santa Bar-bra?

151
00:11:05,985 --> 00:11:09,364
It's Spanish for "City of Great Racks."

152
00:11:09,906 --> 00:11:12,325
Alan,
I got no patience for your kid today.

153
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:13,868
Go do your homework.

154
00:11:14,035 --> 00:11:16,746
Oh, right. I have
a big reading ass-ignment.

155
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:21,834
You're not my audience.

156
00:11:26,839 --> 00:11:30,301
- Remember when he was cute?
- The memory is fading.

157
00:11:30,468 --> 00:11:33,054
So how was your big night with Linda?

158
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:36,349
- Fine.
- Just fine?

159
00:11:36,516 --> 00:11:39,769
Yes. Just fine.

160
00:11:39,936 --> 00:11:43,314
Oh, I see.

161
00:11:44,107 --> 00:11:47,193
No, you don't.

162
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:49,362
All right.

163
00:11:50,154 --> 00:11:54,534
- Wanna talk about it?
- Oh, golly, Alan, more than anything.

164
00:11:55,159 --> 00:11:57,704
Okay, never mind. Stew in it.

165
00:11:57,870 --> 00:11:59,497
Thank you.

166
00:12:06,379 --> 00:12:10,633
I finally got to step up to the plate
and I was swinging a garden hose.

167
00:12:15,555 --> 00:12:17,390
You happy?

168
00:12:17,557 --> 00:12:19,559
Well, I'm not sad.

169
00:12:21,728 --> 00:12:23,730
What do you think the problem was?

170
00:12:26,649 --> 00:12:28,067
I saw her again.

171
00:12:28,234 --> 00:12:29,944
- Saw who?
- Rose.

172
00:12:30,111 --> 00:12:31,988
She brought champagne
to our hotel room...

173
00:12:32,155 --> 00:12:34,115
except this time, she was Hispanic.

174
00:12:36,993 --> 00:12:38,411
What was she last time?

175
00:12:38,578 --> 00:12:40,329
Last time, she was a blond with coffee...

176
00:12:40,496 --> 00:12:42,582
and before that,
she was a redhead with a dog.

177
00:12:42,748 --> 00:12:45,251
- What kind of dog?
- What difference does it make?

178
00:12:46,544 --> 00:12:48,087
I like dogs.

179
00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:50,673
Go on.

180
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:53,759
If I didn't know any better,
I'd say she was stalking me again.

181
00:12:53,926 --> 00:12:56,762
- From England?
- We don't know she's in England.

182
00:12:56,929 --> 00:12:59,724
She sends letters and postcards.
Jake gets them all the time.

183
00:12:59,891 --> 00:13:03,769
Like she couldn't leave a stack of them
with some friend to mail every few days.

184
00:13:04,270 --> 00:13:07,940
Oh, wow, are you listening to yourself?
Even Rose isn't that crazy.

185
00:13:08,107 --> 00:13:10,776
Oh, and she's gonna fly back and forth
with a dog?

186
00:13:10,943 --> 00:13:13,779
She could hire a local dog.

187
00:13:15,615 --> 00:13:18,034
Charlie, Rose is in England.
She's not stalking you.

188
00:13:18,201 --> 00:13:21,245
And whatever you think you're seeing
is in your head.

189
00:13:23,164 --> 00:13:24,790
Yeah, you're probably right.

190
00:13:26,375 --> 00:13:30,338
Regardless,
last night was less than a triumph.

191
00:13:31,005 --> 00:13:33,716
Why didn't you just take
one of your pills?

192
00:13:33,883 --> 00:13:37,970
Because somebody else
took my last three.

193
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:40,973
Oh, yeah.

194
00:13:41,474 --> 00:13:43,059
Thank you.

195
00:13:44,727 --> 00:13:46,938
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

196
00:13:47,897 --> 00:13:48,981
That's four.

197
00:13:49,899 --> 00:13:51,651
The first one was a twofer.

198
00:13:55,154 --> 00:13:57,657
- What kind of dog?
- I don't know, it was a dog.

199
00:13:59,033 --> 00:14:02,703
Four legs and a tail.
Can we please get back to my problem?

200
00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:05,289
Not a dog person.

201
00:14:06,249 --> 00:14:09,001
So you believe
you're seeing people who aren't there?

202
00:14:09,168 --> 00:14:10,294
No, no, no.

203
00:14:10,461 --> 00:14:12,755
They're there,
but they're not who they are.

204
00:14:12,922 --> 00:14:14,340
Well, then, who are they?

205
00:14:14,507 --> 00:14:18,010
I don't know who they are,
but they all look like Rose.

206
00:14:18,177 --> 00:14:22,014
- Your stalker.
- Well, that's kind of harsh.

207
00:14:22,181 --> 00:14:24,016
You told me she broke into your home...

208
00:14:24,183 --> 00:14:27,436
disrobed and handcuffed herself
to your refrigerator.

209
00:14:28,104 --> 00:14:30,022
Just the one time.

210
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:34,777
So why do I keep seeing her
everywhere I go?

211
00:14:34,944 --> 00:14:38,864
Well, Charlie, if I tell you that now,
what'll we do for the rest of the hour?

212
00:14:40,074 --> 00:14:41,367
I'm joshing.

213
00:14:44,286 --> 00:14:46,539
Why don't we talk
about your current relationship?

214
00:14:46,706 --> 00:14:50,042
Linda? Well, let's see.
She's a municipal-court judge.

215
00:14:50,209 --> 00:14:52,378
- Very impressive.
- Thank you.

216
00:14:52,545 --> 00:14:53,879
I meant for her, Charlie.

217
00:14:55,297 --> 00:14:57,258
It's hardly your accomplishment now,
is it?

218
00:14:57,717 --> 00:15:00,928
Well, yeah, in a way.
I've never done a judge before.

219
00:15:01,095 --> 00:15:04,306
Well, from what you told me,
you still haven't.

220
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:07,393
Touché.

221
00:15:07,893 --> 00:15:10,062
Pays to listen.

222
00:15:10,229 --> 00:15:13,065
- So how old is Linda?
- She's about my age.

223
00:15:13,232 --> 00:15:15,568
First time you've been
with a woman that old?

224
00:15:15,735 --> 00:15:17,278
Oh, no, not at all.

225
00:15:17,445 --> 00:15:20,072
So you've had age-appropriate
relationships before?

226
00:15:20,239 --> 00:15:23,075
Relationships? No, no, are you crazy?

227
00:15:23,242 --> 00:15:26,162
Am I crazy? Pot, kettle, Charlie.

228
00:15:26,871 --> 00:15:30,332
Okay, look, I didn't come to therapy
to talk this to death.

229
00:15:31,834 --> 00:15:36,046
I've seen Rose three times
and it's ruining my sex life with Linda.

230
00:15:36,213 --> 00:15:39,967
Can you help me or do I have to learn
to shoot pool with a rope?

231
00:15:40,551 --> 00:15:42,511
Well, thank you
for that disturbing image.

232
00:15:44,930 --> 00:15:47,266
Best I can tell,
for the first time in your life...

233
00:15:47,433 --> 00:15:49,769
you are involved
in an adult relationship.

234
00:15:49,935 --> 00:15:52,938
It's challenging,
maybe even a little intimidating.

235
00:15:53,105 --> 00:15:56,150
And the fact that you're fantasizing
about a woman in England...

236
00:15:56,317 --> 00:15:59,278
who idolized you
beyond all rational measure...

237
00:15:59,445 --> 00:16:02,156
well, that tells me
that you're afraid to grow up.

238
00:16:02,323 --> 00:16:04,450
And we call that
the Peter Pan syndrome.

239
00:16:06,368 --> 00:16:08,287
That's pretty good.

240
00:16:08,746 --> 00:16:12,708
So, what can we do,
you know, Peter-wise?

241
00:16:12,875 --> 00:16:16,212
If you're committed to personal growth,
you'll walk through your fear...

242
00:16:16,378 --> 00:16:19,965
and embrace the challenges
of a really meaningful relationship...

243
00:16:20,132 --> 00:16:21,467
with an adult woman.

244
00:16:22,009 --> 00:16:25,221
And your only other choice
is to live the emotionally stunted life...

245
00:16:25,387 --> 00:16:27,973
you've been living over and over.

246
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:30,893
Never growing, never changing.

247
00:16:33,896 --> 00:16:37,525
Good afternoon, and welcome aboard
British Airways Flight 471...

248
00:16:37,691 --> 00:16:40,402
nonstop
to London 's Heathrow Airport.

249
00:17:00,839 --> 00:17:02,591
Charlie.

250
00:17:02,758 --> 00:17:04,176
Surprise.

251
00:17:05,803 --> 00:17:07,513
What are you doing here?

252
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:10,015
I'm not sure. I just needed to see you.

253
00:17:10,182 --> 00:17:13,185
I need to talk to you. I can
come back if now is not a good time.

254
00:17:13,352 --> 00:17:15,104
No, no, it's okay.

255
00:17:15,729 --> 00:17:18,941
I know you've probably moved on.
I thought I had too...

256
00:17:19,108 --> 00:17:23,028
but everywhere I look,
I keep seeing your face...

257
00:17:23,195 --> 00:17:26,740
so I started thinking, maybe...

258
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:30,244
I don't know what I'm thinking.
Are you busy?

259
00:17:30,411 --> 00:17:32,955
Can I take you out
for a cold beer or something?

260
00:17:33,122 --> 00:17:37,042
Actually, on this side of the pond,
we drink our beer warm.

261
00:17:37,918 --> 00:17:39,545
You can still catch a buzz, right?

262
00:17:40,337 --> 00:17:42,923
- Oh, yeah.
- Then warm's fine.

263
00:17:43,090 --> 00:17:44,133
Okay.

264
00:17:44,299 --> 00:17:47,469
- Well, I'll just get my purse.
- Great.

265
00:17:58,522 --> 00:18:00,399
So I'm not screwing up
any plans of yours?

266
00:18:00,566 --> 00:18:04,319
Oh, no. This fits perfectly into my plans.

267
00:18:09,275 --> 00:18:11,277
- Oh, Linda, hi.
- Hi, Alan.

268
00:18:11,444 --> 00:18:15,114
I'm sorry to show up unannounced, but
Charlie hasn't been answering his phone.

269
00:18:15,281 --> 00:18:17,033
And I wanted to make sure he's okay.

270
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:20,286
Oh, Charlie's fine.
We have a pharmacy that delivers.

271
00:18:20,787 --> 00:18:22,372
What?

272
00:18:22,956 --> 00:18:25,959
- Nothing, nothing. Come on in.
- Thanks.

273
00:18:26,125 --> 00:18:28,920
He should be getting up
sometime soon, anyway.

274
00:18:29,087 --> 00:18:31,089
So how are things with you and Donna?

275
00:18:31,256 --> 00:18:33,132
Good, good.

276
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:35,134
I'll go get Charlie.

277
00:18:35,301 --> 00:18:37,887
Hey, Dad, girls' volleyball.
Lot of bouncing boobs.

278
00:18:38,054 --> 00:18:40,098
- Not now, Jake.
- You told me to tell you.

279
00:18:40,264 --> 00:18:41,391
- I didn't.
- Yes, you did.

280
00:18:41,557 --> 00:18:43,059
Shut up.

281
00:18:44,644 --> 00:18:45,895
Oh, hey.

282
00:18:46,062 --> 00:18:48,731
- Hello. You must be Jake.
- Yeah, who are you?

283
00:18:48,898 --> 00:18:50,984
Linda.
I'm a friend of your Uncle Charlie's.

284
00:18:51,150 --> 00:18:52,568
Are you the judge?

285
00:18:52,735 --> 00:18:55,571
- Do you play volleyball?
- No. Do you?

286
00:18:55,738 --> 00:18:57,865
No, I just like to watch them
jump up and down.

287
00:18:58,032 --> 00:19:01,452
Okay. Heigh-ho, go away.

288
00:19:01,828 --> 00:19:05,248
I thought Charlie was asleep,
but he's not in his room.

289
00:19:05,415 --> 00:19:06,749
Berta, have you seen Charlie?

290
00:19:06,916 --> 00:19:08,251
- He's not in his bed?
- No.

291
00:19:08,418 --> 00:19:10,253
- Passed out on the bathroom floor?
- No.

292
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:12,922
- Rubbing oil on the volleyball girls?
- No.

293
00:19:16,759 --> 00:19:19,762
Well, that just leaves the bars,
hospitals and jails.

294
00:19:20,972 --> 00:19:22,306
I'll go get the yellow pages.

295
00:19:24,225 --> 00:19:26,436
Well, he couldn't have gone very far.

296
00:19:26,602 --> 00:19:28,938
Hey, Dad. Hot girl in a thong.

297
00:19:29,105 --> 00:19:30,606
What time is it?

298
00:19:39,574 --> 00:19:40,950
Tepid.

299
00:19:42,368 --> 00:19:45,037
So London certainly agrees
with you, Rose.

300
00:19:45,204 --> 00:19:48,499
- You look beautiful.
- Thank you, Charlie.

301
00:19:48,666 --> 00:19:50,668
I just can't believe you're here.

302
00:19:50,835 --> 00:19:55,047
Yeah, well, I wanted you to know I've
been thinking a lot about you lately...

303
00:19:55,214 --> 00:19:57,550
and I miss you.

304
00:19:57,925 --> 00:20:00,511
Oh, Charlie, I miss you too.

305
00:20:00,970 --> 00:20:02,555
Are you seeing anybody?

306
00:20:03,014 --> 00:20:08,644
Actually, I am seeing someone, but
I'm not really sure where it's going yet.

307
00:20:09,353 --> 00:20:11,439
- You?
- To be honest...

308
00:20:11,606 --> 00:20:13,774
there is one lady I've been dating.

309
00:20:13,941 --> 00:20:15,568
She's actually my own age.

310
00:20:16,027 --> 00:20:18,571
- No.
- Yeah.

311
00:20:18,738 --> 00:20:21,949
But my therapist says
she's not good for me.

312
00:20:23,284 --> 00:20:25,411
And you think I am?

313
00:20:25,578 --> 00:20:30,041
Well, you've always loved me for
who I am instead of who I could be...

314
00:20:30,208 --> 00:20:32,877
which is really wonderful,
because, let's face it...

315
00:20:33,044 --> 00:20:35,129
we both love who I am.

316
00:20:37,965 --> 00:20:39,675
I do love you, Charlie.

317
00:20:40,176 --> 00:20:41,344
Great.

318
00:20:43,346 --> 00:20:44,430
So?

319
00:20:45,306 --> 00:20:47,183
So what?

320
00:20:47,558 --> 00:20:49,519
So, what's next?

321
00:20:50,478 --> 00:20:52,021
What do you mean?

322
00:20:52,939 --> 00:20:56,442
Well, you can't expect me to go back
to what we had without a commitment.

323
00:20:58,819 --> 00:21:00,863
- A commitment?
- Yes.

324
00:21:01,030 --> 00:21:02,615
I think we should get married.

325
00:21:05,076 --> 00:21:06,452
Married?

326
00:21:07,286 --> 00:21:08,704
Sell the house in Malibu...

327
00:21:08,871 --> 00:21:11,874
and move to a kid-friendly
neighborhood here in London.

328
00:21:13,251 --> 00:21:14,961
Kid?

329
00:21:15,461 --> 00:21:17,171
Kids.

330
00:21:17,338 --> 00:21:19,799
We're gonna have kids, aren't we?

331
00:21:24,553 --> 00:21:28,015
Good afternoon and welcome aboard
British Airways Flight 472...

332
00:21:28,182 --> 00:21:31,978
nonstop
to Los Angeles International Airport.
