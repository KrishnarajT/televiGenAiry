1
00:00:03,186 --> 00:00:05,146
Okay, okay, okay.
It's your birthday.

2
00:00:05,313 --> 00:00:07,691
We're going to a ball game,
only got three tickets.

3
00:00:07,857 --> 00:00:09,442
- Cool.
- It's not his birthday.

4
00:00:09,609 --> 00:00:11,611
- What else you get me?
- Not your birthday.

5
00:00:11,778 --> 00:00:14,489
- Charlie, what's going on?
- I've got a delicate situation.

6
00:00:14,656 --> 00:00:18,034
- I need to appear as if I have plans.
- Does your situation have a name?

7
00:00:18,201 --> 00:00:20,870
I'm sure she does.
Just follow my lead.

8
00:00:21,037 --> 00:00:22,914
- Dodgers or Angels?
- Let's say Dodgers.

9
00:00:23,081 --> 00:00:25,250
See, the kid knows how to do this.

10
00:00:25,917 --> 00:00:28,753
I'll get my mitt. Oh, boy, a ball game.

11
00:00:29,713 --> 00:00:32,090
- Now, that's commitment.
- That's not commitment.

12
00:00:32,257 --> 00:00:33,883
That's lead paint in the nursery.

13
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:36,886
Hey, Steve, you down there?

14
00:00:37,053 --> 00:00:39,222
Oh, yeah, and my name's Steve.

15
00:00:40,098 --> 00:00:41,141
Coming.

16
00:00:41,308 --> 00:00:44,561
Charlie, I'm not gonna lie to some
poor woman so you can dump her.

17
00:00:44,728 --> 00:00:46,646
I am not dumping her.

18
00:00:46,813 --> 00:00:48,607
We've just grown apart.

19
00:00:48,773 --> 00:00:51,276
Since you picked her up
at a bar last night?

20
00:00:51,818 --> 00:00:53,069
People change.

21
00:00:54,779 --> 00:00:55,822
Hello?

22
00:00:55,989 --> 00:00:57,824
Oh, God.

23
00:00:59,075 --> 00:01:00,118
In here, Mom.

24
00:01:00,285 --> 00:01:02,829
So, what are my boys up to today?

25
00:01:05,916 --> 00:01:09,085
We're going to a Dodger game,
and we've only got three tickets.

26
00:01:17,202 --> 00:01:20,456
So you're on your way to a ball game.

27
00:01:20,622 --> 00:01:22,916
Yep. It's a little treat
for Jake's birthday.

28
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:24,627
That was months ago.

29
00:01:26,295 --> 00:01:29,006
We were waiting for bobblehead day.

30
00:01:31,133 --> 00:01:34,637
It's good for Jake
to see other bobbleheads.

31
00:01:36,013 --> 00:01:37,473
Hey, Dad, I just checked online.

32
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:40,351
The Dodgers are in San Francisco today.

33
00:01:42,019 --> 00:01:45,147
Yes, well, we'd better get going then.

34
00:01:47,983 --> 00:01:49,818
It's quite a drive.

35
00:01:49,985 --> 00:01:53,197
Must you continue
with this pathetic, little charade?

36
00:01:53,656 --> 00:01:56,116
At this point, we're kind of committed.

37
00:01:56,825 --> 00:01:58,827
All right, we're not going to a ball game.

38
00:01:58,994 --> 00:02:01,955
We're not?
Man, this is the worst birthday ever.

39
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:04,875
Why do you have to lie to me?

40
00:02:05,042 --> 00:02:07,002
We don't have to.
It's a choice we make.

41
00:02:07,836 --> 00:02:10,756
Well, you both might find this
all amusing.

42
00:02:10,923 --> 00:02:13,550
But I do have feelings, and I can be hurt.

43
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:16,053
Sorry, Mom.

44
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:19,515
It's just crushing to know
that my own sons think so little of me.

45
00:02:19,682 --> 00:02:22,142
Really? After all this time?

46
00:02:23,018 --> 00:02:24,269
Charlie.

47
00:02:24,436 --> 00:02:26,730
We're both sorry.
Is there anything we can do?

48
00:02:26,897 --> 00:02:28,649
Well, as a matter of fact there is.

49
00:02:28,816 --> 00:02:30,693
Oh, you just walked right into that.

50
00:02:31,819 --> 00:02:33,862
Teddy is out of town,
and I need an escort...

51
00:02:34,029 --> 00:02:36,365
for the Civic Light Opera benefit
this evening.

52
00:02:36,532 --> 00:02:38,659
Why don't you try
one of those escort services?

53
00:02:38,826 --> 00:02:41,370
Charlie, if I were gonna pay
$200 per hour for a man...

54
00:02:41,537 --> 00:02:44,039
I would not be taking him
to the opera.

55
00:02:44,206 --> 00:02:45,249
That's fair.

56
00:02:45,416 --> 00:02:48,419
Well, I'd love to help you out, Mom,
but I have a date tonight.

57
00:02:49,253 --> 00:02:54,008
Oh, so now it's inflatable-sex-doll night
at Dodger Stadium.

58
00:02:55,009 --> 00:02:56,302
No.

59
00:02:56,468 --> 00:02:58,220
No, I really have a date.

60
00:02:58,387 --> 00:03:00,764
And the doll was a gag gift
from one of my patients.

61
00:03:01,557 --> 00:03:02,725
Charlie, what about you?

62
00:03:03,267 --> 00:03:05,853
I tried it once, but I prefer
a real woman.

63
00:03:06,478 --> 00:03:09,231
Do you have plans this evening?

64
00:03:09,398 --> 00:03:10,566
Oh, l... Well...

65
00:03:10,733 --> 00:03:12,484
Hey, Steve.

66
00:03:12,651 --> 00:03:14,570
In here.

67
00:03:14,737 --> 00:03:16,447
As a matter of fact, I do have plans.

68
00:03:16,613 --> 00:03:19,575
I have a very special lady friend
over for the weekend.

69
00:03:19,742 --> 00:03:21,660
And here she is now. Hey, baby.

70
00:03:21,827 --> 00:03:23,245
Hi.

71
00:03:24,538 --> 00:03:25,873
Excuse me.

72
00:03:31,086 --> 00:03:32,212
Isn't she something?

73
00:03:36,508 --> 00:03:39,094
Okay, but get a town car,
because I ain't going sober.

74
00:03:47,061 --> 00:03:48,103
Your town car's here.

75
00:03:48,687 --> 00:03:50,064
Terrific.

76
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:51,273
Come on.

77
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:55,069
I have been to these things with Mom,
and I know you think it's gonna be bad.

78
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:59,281
But believe me, it's gonna be worse
than you can even imagine.

79
00:03:59,448 --> 00:04:01,617
You're really enjoying this, aren't you?

80
00:04:01,784 --> 00:04:03,911
You just love seeing me unhappy.

81
00:04:04,078 --> 00:04:06,955
Well, yeah.

82
00:04:07,539 --> 00:04:10,626
Did you feel sorry for me
when I had to wear that cowboy outfit...

83
00:04:10,793 --> 00:04:12,294
to her celebrity AIDS hoedown?

84
00:04:13,045 --> 00:04:14,505
- That was different.
- How?

85
00:04:14,672 --> 00:04:15,923
It was you.

86
00:04:16,674 --> 00:04:19,134
Yeah, well, now it's you.

87
00:04:19,301 --> 00:04:21,804
Yippee kay yay, mother accompanier.

88
00:04:27,601 --> 00:04:29,353
Want a few tips?

89
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:30,562
Like what?

90
00:04:30,729 --> 00:04:31,939
Well, let's see.

91
00:04:32,106 --> 00:04:34,775
Mom likes to starve herself
for a few days before these...

92
00:04:34,942 --> 00:04:36,402
so she can fit into her gown.

93
00:04:36,568 --> 00:04:40,114
That means she'll be knocking back
vodka gimlets on an empty stomach.

94
00:04:40,698 --> 00:04:45,285
- Oh, jeez, she can be a cranky drunk.
- Cranky?

95
00:04:45,786 --> 00:04:49,164
I got bitch-slapped
with my own 10-gallon hat.

96
00:04:49,832 --> 00:04:52,960
So, what's the tip?
Don't wear a 10-gallon hat?

97
00:04:53,127 --> 00:04:56,171
All you have to do is bring along
a little baggie of crackers...

98
00:04:56,338 --> 00:04:57,840
you know, saltines, Goldfish.

99
00:04:58,007 --> 00:05:00,884
Anything you can stuff down her throat
to soak up the booze.

100
00:05:01,677 --> 00:05:03,512
How about a throw pillow?

101
00:05:05,055 --> 00:05:07,975
Oh, oh, and whatever you do,
don't let her take off her shoes.

102
00:05:08,142 --> 00:05:09,560
- Why not?
- Well, A,

103
00:05:09,727 --> 00:05:11,812
you'll be carrying them all night,
and B...

104
00:05:11,979 --> 00:05:13,522
you'll wind up giving her
a foot massage.

105
00:05:13,689 --> 00:05:15,733
That's not something
anybody wants to see.

106
00:05:16,358 --> 00:05:17,526
Oh, God.

107
00:05:17,693 --> 00:05:20,821
Not to mention the fact
that it puts you on bunion patrol.

108
00:05:23,365 --> 00:05:25,075
Anyway, have fun.

109
00:05:25,868 --> 00:05:30,164
I'm off to pick up a beautiful, smart,
funny, sexually-available woman...

110
00:05:30,331 --> 00:05:33,250
who, best of all, is not my mother.

111
00:05:33,876 --> 00:05:36,211
Give it time. You'll get her there.

112
00:05:38,088 --> 00:05:41,008
In consideration of the evening
you have ahead of you...

113
00:05:41,175 --> 00:05:42,926
I'm gonna let you have that one.

114
00:05:48,766 --> 00:05:51,393
Yeah, these are the good times.

115
00:05:56,398 --> 00:05:57,566
Another gimlet, please.

116
00:05:57,733 --> 00:06:00,235
You sure you don't want a Wheat Thin?

117
00:06:02,112 --> 00:06:03,822
Wheaty.

118
00:06:03,989 --> 00:06:05,991
No, I need the liquor to dull the pain.

119
00:06:06,158 --> 00:06:07,785
My shoes are killing me.

120
00:06:07,951 --> 00:06:11,622
Yeah, but they look wonderful on your
feet, right where they are now.

121
00:06:11,914 --> 00:06:14,750
- Oh, look who's over there.
- Who?

122
00:06:14,917 --> 00:06:17,753
One of the most powerful
union leaders in Hollywood.

123
00:06:18,253 --> 00:06:19,755
What about him?

124
00:06:22,383 --> 00:06:25,094
- Really? The mob?
- Yeah.

125
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:28,430
They say he killed a writer once
just to make a point.

126
00:06:29,098 --> 00:06:30,849
What was the point?

127
00:06:31,266 --> 00:06:32,601
"I can kill a writer."

128
00:06:34,853 --> 00:06:37,272
- And the silver-haired man he's talking to.
- Yeah?

129
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:41,110
That is the king
of vaginal-rejuvenation surgery.

130
00:06:41,276 --> 00:06:44,446
But, interestingly,
he's never used one himself...

131
00:06:44,613 --> 00:06:46,490
rejuvenated or otherwise.

132
00:06:48,158 --> 00:06:50,828
Wouldn't that make him
the queen of vaginal surgery?

133
00:06:51,787 --> 00:06:53,372
Good for you, Charlie.

134
00:06:53,539 --> 00:06:54,790
I wish I'd thought of that.

135
00:06:54,957 --> 00:06:56,417
And from now on, I did.

136
00:06:57,376 --> 00:06:58,419
It's yours.

137
00:06:58,585 --> 00:07:00,629
So, what other dirt you got?

138
00:07:00,796 --> 00:07:04,633
Oh, darling, you know,
I don't like to speak ill of anyone.

139
00:07:07,386 --> 00:07:08,429
All right.

140
00:07:08,595 --> 00:07:13,434
Bankrupt, embezzler, tushie tuck,
bigamist, pill freak.

141
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,977
And that one over there?

142
00:07:15,144 --> 00:07:18,605
Underwent surgery to have a cell phone
removed from his lower intestine.

143
00:07:20,357 --> 00:07:22,985
- How in the world did it get there?
- One can speculate.

144
00:07:23,152 --> 00:07:25,863
But I have it on good authority
that it was set to vibrate.

145
00:07:28,324 --> 00:07:30,034
How do you know all these things?

146
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:33,912
Oh, Charlie,
it's my business to know these things.

147
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:40,085
High-end real estate is all about gathering
information and forging relationships.

148
00:07:40,252 --> 00:07:41,420
Hello, Beatrice, darling.

149
00:07:41,587 --> 00:07:45,716
Lovely to see you,
you two-dollar whore.

150
00:07:46,425 --> 00:07:49,219
You know, Mom, it's great
to watch you doing autopsies...

151
00:07:49,386 --> 00:07:50,721
when I'm not the cadaver.

152
00:07:50,888 --> 00:07:53,265
Half the fun is sharing
with someone you love.

153
00:07:53,432 --> 00:07:55,309
You see that statuesque woman
over there?

154
00:07:55,476 --> 00:07:57,478
The one with the knock-off
Prada handbag?

155
00:07:57,645 --> 00:07:59,271
Don't tell me. She's not a woman.

156
00:07:59,438 --> 00:08:00,731
Oh, she's a woman.

157
00:08:00,898 --> 00:08:03,108
She's an amazing woman.

158
00:08:03,275 --> 00:08:06,320
She built a children's hospital
in Guatemala.

159
00:08:06,487 --> 00:08:07,738
Yeah, and...?

160
00:08:07,905 --> 00:08:11,825
Once they're healthy enough to walk,
she flies them to Los Angeles...

161
00:08:11,992 --> 00:08:14,703
and leases them out to celebrities
as household slaves.

162
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:15,996
Hello, dear.

163
00:08:18,415 --> 00:08:20,668
I'm trying to sell her home.

164
00:08:20,834 --> 00:08:23,921
Kind of hard to put a good spin
on media-room-slash-dungeon.

165
00:08:30,970 --> 00:08:33,013
I'm sorry, Alan. I can't do this.

166
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:34,974
Sure you can. I mean, you are.

167
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:38,852
And if you'll allow me to say so,
you're pretty good at it.

168
00:08:39,019 --> 00:08:40,604
It's not you, it's me.

169
00:08:41,438 --> 00:08:43,524
- Yeah, right.
- What is that supposed to mean?

170
00:08:43,691 --> 00:08:50,072
Sharon, I have been rejected
by 32 different women in my life.

171
00:08:50,239 --> 00:08:52,866
And you know what?
It's never been me.

172
00:08:53,617 --> 00:08:55,536
Okay, it's you. Feel better?

173
00:08:56,245 --> 00:08:58,122
Actually, no.

174
00:08:58,288 --> 00:08:59,415
You're a very nice guy.

175
00:08:59,581 --> 00:09:02,251
That's even worse. You know
what they say about nice guys.

176
00:09:02,418 --> 00:09:03,585
Yes, they finish last.

177
00:09:03,752 --> 00:09:06,046
No, they finish in the shower.

178
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:09,800
What do you want? I can't help
if I'm not sexually attracted to you.

179
00:09:09,967 --> 00:09:12,094
Yes, you can.
You just have to make an effort.

180
00:09:13,637 --> 00:09:15,931
You know those jokes
you don't get right away?

181
00:09:16,098 --> 00:09:20,185
And then in a day or two,
you find yourself laughing and laughing?

182
00:09:20,352 --> 00:09:22,062
That's me.

183
00:09:22,938 --> 00:09:24,732
I'm one of those jokes.

184
00:09:25,441 --> 00:09:29,486
You'll sleep with me now,
and you'll be attracted to me later.

185
00:09:30,988 --> 00:09:33,157
Please, Sharon, just give me a chance.

186
00:09:34,783 --> 00:09:35,993
Oh, what the hell.

187
00:09:39,121 --> 00:09:40,622
Good to see you, dear.

188
00:09:40,789 --> 00:09:44,627
You look marvelous. For a heroin addict.

189
00:09:45,753 --> 00:09:46,962
Let me ask you something.

190
00:09:47,129 --> 00:09:49,673
If you don't like any of these people,
why do you come?

191
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,634
Charlie, do you read the paper?

192
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:55,179
Do you have any idea what the Los
Angeles real-estate market is like now?

193
00:09:55,346 --> 00:09:57,306
Can't say I do.
How are those feet feeling?

194
00:09:57,473 --> 00:10:01,644
- You wanna put your shoes back on?
- No one is selling unless they have to.

195
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:04,813
Which means, I have to be out
working these rooms every night...

196
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:08,025
to learn who's getting divorced,
who's dying, can't make bail...

197
00:10:08,192 --> 00:10:10,319
whose crappy sitcom got canceled.

198
00:10:10,486 --> 00:10:13,489
I mean, let's face it.
I'm not a young woman anymore.

199
00:10:13,656 --> 00:10:16,784
In the old days, I could find out
all that stuff at home on my back.

200
00:10:18,577 --> 00:10:19,912
Evelyn.

201
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:21,664
Margaret, good to see you.

202
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:25,167
- How's married life?
- Oh, just one long honeymoon.

203
00:10:25,334 --> 00:10:27,836
That's because she bangs
a different groom every night.

204
00:10:30,005 --> 00:10:32,508
Hi. Charlie Harper.

205
00:10:33,008 --> 00:10:35,427
Oh, my God.

206
00:10:36,345 --> 00:10:38,138
That was amazing.

207
00:10:38,931 --> 00:10:40,099
Wasn't that amazing?

208
00:10:40,265 --> 00:10:42,184
I hate myself.

209
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:46,355
What? No, no, no, you were great.

210
00:10:46,522 --> 00:10:48,482
You did a crackerjack job.

211
00:10:48,649 --> 00:10:53,696
Why do I always do this? Why do I have
this constant need to degrade myself?

212
00:10:57,074 --> 00:10:59,201
Would it help to cuddle?

213
00:10:59,368 --> 00:11:01,912
Don't touch me.

214
00:11:02,538 --> 00:11:04,832
Okay. No touching.

215
00:11:05,666 --> 00:11:12,047
The image of you lying on top of me
will haunt me forever.

216
00:11:15,801 --> 00:11:17,219
Did you wanna be on top?

217
00:11:18,929 --> 00:11:22,766
Because if you give me a half an hour
and a glass of juice, we can try that.

218
00:11:25,978 --> 00:11:29,106
Hi, hi, Dr. Phillips. It's me, Sharon.

219
00:11:29,273 --> 00:11:31,233
I did it again.

220
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:33,610
I don't know why.

221
00:11:33,777 --> 00:11:34,945
I felt sorry for him.

222
00:11:36,905 --> 00:11:40,367
Hey, hey, why don't I whip us up
some French toast?

223
00:11:41,702 --> 00:11:43,912
Shut up.

224
00:11:44,913 --> 00:11:49,710
Okay, I'm just gonna get a nice glass
of cran-apple just in case.

225
00:11:49,877 --> 00:11:51,420
How bad was it?

226
00:11:51,587 --> 00:11:53,922
How bad was it? I'm in a fold-out bed.

227
00:12:00,372 --> 00:12:01,540
Morning.

228
00:12:01,707 --> 00:12:03,292
Morning.

229
00:12:04,168 --> 00:12:06,170
Hey, Berta, you're a woman...

230
00:12:06,336 --> 00:12:08,630
Where are we going with this, zippy?

231
00:12:09,173 --> 00:12:10,215
I was just wondering.

232
00:12:10,382 --> 00:12:13,469
What does it mean when someone
starts crying uncontrollably...

233
00:12:13,635 --> 00:12:14,678
after sex?

234
00:12:14,845 --> 00:12:18,557
Well, in my experience,
it usually means the conjugal visit's over.

235
00:12:22,853 --> 00:12:24,146
Right. Thanks.

236
00:12:24,646 --> 00:12:26,648
What happened?
You get yourself a weeper?

237
00:12:26,815 --> 00:12:28,150
Yeah. Yeah, last night.

238
00:12:28,317 --> 00:12:30,319
I've never seen anything like it before.

239
00:12:30,486 --> 00:12:31,737
That's hard to believe.

240
00:12:33,238 --> 00:12:35,199
I got it.

241
00:12:36,075 --> 00:12:37,659
Hello?

242
00:12:37,826 --> 00:12:39,078
Oh, hey, Mom. How are you?

243
00:12:39,995 --> 00:12:41,622
Yeah, that was fun last night.

244
00:12:42,956 --> 00:12:45,084
No, I'm not doing anything. Why?

245
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:47,544
Sure. I'd love to go shopping with you.

246
00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:51,882
Great. I'll see you then.

247
00:12:58,430 --> 00:12:59,848
What?

248
00:13:00,641 --> 00:13:02,226
- Nothing.
- Nothing.

249
00:13:02,851 --> 00:13:04,937
Hey, hey, Mom's not that bad.

250
00:13:05,104 --> 00:13:08,565
In fact,
she's kind of fun to hang out with.

251
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:12,861
That has to be the creepiest thing
I've ever heard.

252
00:13:13,028 --> 00:13:17,908
You know, I said the same thing
to myself just a couple minutes ago.

253
00:13:23,539 --> 00:13:26,542
- You sure you can't stay for dinner?
- Oh, I'd love to, sweetie.

254
00:13:26,709 --> 00:13:30,254
But Teddy's back in town,
and Mommy plans to get laid tonight.

255
00:13:30,421 --> 00:13:33,173
Well, good for you.
Please, give him my best.

256
00:13:33,799 --> 00:13:35,759
Only after I give him my best.

257
00:13:37,428 --> 00:13:39,763
- Hello.
- Oh, hi, Alan.

258
00:13:39,930 --> 00:13:41,473
Don't forget your little gifty.

259
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:43,100
You bought him a gifty?

260
00:13:43,267 --> 00:13:45,602
My way of saying,
"Thank you for lunch."

261
00:13:45,769 --> 00:13:46,979
You took her to lunch?

262
00:13:47,146 --> 00:13:49,440
I must have gained 5 pounds.

263
00:13:49,606 --> 00:13:51,650
Oh, stop. You have a terrific figure.

264
00:13:51,817 --> 00:13:53,235
Thank you.

265
00:13:54,111 --> 00:13:55,946
Are you high?

266
00:13:56,655 --> 00:13:59,450
It never hurts to pay a compliment
to someone you care about.

267
00:13:59,616 --> 00:14:01,410
Yeah, you should try it
once in a while.

268
00:14:01,577 --> 00:14:03,495
Might cut down
on that postcoital weeping.

269
00:14:05,456 --> 00:14:07,166
How did you know about that?

270
00:14:07,332 --> 00:14:09,293
Berta told me, I told Mom.

271
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:11,336
Your brother and I
don't have any secrets.

272
00:14:14,173 --> 00:14:16,341
Maybe I'm high.

273
00:14:17,134 --> 00:14:19,219
Okay, well, I must be off.

274
00:14:19,386 --> 00:14:23,015
Places to go, houses to sell,
new widows to cold call.

275
00:14:23,182 --> 00:14:24,725
Oh, oh, that reminds me.

276
00:14:24,892 --> 00:14:27,561
Charlie, some woman named Margaret
called looking for you.

277
00:14:27,728 --> 00:14:28,812
Margaret?

278
00:14:28,979 --> 00:14:31,315
Oh, yeah, Honeymoon Margaret
from last night.

279
00:14:31,482 --> 00:14:32,983
Charlie.

280
00:14:33,150 --> 00:14:35,486
The woman's husband
is one of my biggest clients.

281
00:14:35,652 --> 00:14:39,114
- Oh, Mom.
- Please, I'm not asking as your mother.

282
00:14:39,281 --> 00:14:41,158
I'm asking as your friend.

283
00:14:42,951 --> 00:14:45,454
All right, as a friend, hands off.

284
00:14:45,621 --> 00:14:47,706
Thank you, darling.

285
00:14:48,207 --> 00:14:49,249
I love you.

286
00:14:49,416 --> 00:14:50,918
See you, Alan.

287
00:14:51,668 --> 00:14:53,962
I guess I'll just throw this away.

288
00:14:55,172 --> 00:14:57,049
What?
You're not gonna call her, are you?

289
00:14:57,216 --> 00:15:00,052
Well, it's a bit of a dilemma.

290
00:15:00,219 --> 00:15:02,846
On the one hand,
there's this beautiful, available woman.

291
00:15:03,013 --> 00:15:04,765
- She's married.
- According to Mom...

292
00:15:04,932 --> 00:15:06,141
not a fanatic about it.

293
00:15:07,559 --> 00:15:11,814
So am I the kind of guy who would go
back on his word to his own mother...

294
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:14,108
just for a really hot one-night stand?

295
00:15:16,443 --> 00:15:18,028
Is that a rhetorical question?

296
00:15:19,029 --> 00:15:20,531
Tell you what.

297
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:22,449
We'll leave it to chance.

298
00:15:23,701 --> 00:15:26,036
If I miss, I'll take the high road.

299
00:15:26,203 --> 00:15:28,080
If it goes in, I'll call Margaret.

300
00:15:40,384 --> 00:15:41,552
I guess it's fate.

301
00:16:02,197 --> 00:16:03,449
Are you ready for me?

302
00:16:04,033 --> 00:16:06,785
Oh, bravo.

303
00:16:14,543 --> 00:16:18,380
Just to be clear,
this is a tit for tat kind of deal, right?

304
00:16:18,547 --> 00:16:20,758
Your husband cheated on you,
the rotten bastard.

305
00:16:20,924 --> 00:16:24,136
- And now you're cheating on him?
- No, he never cheated on me.

306
00:16:24,762 --> 00:16:27,431
Oh, so what?
He's mean to you, he's abusive?

307
00:16:28,098 --> 00:16:29,892
No. He's a doll.

308
00:16:31,810 --> 00:16:33,437
Is he gay?

309
00:16:33,604 --> 00:16:35,606
Not at all.

310
00:16:36,774 --> 00:16:39,234
Was he in some sort
of bizarre hunting accident?

311
00:16:39,985 --> 00:16:41,028
What?

312
00:16:41,195 --> 00:16:44,156
You know, fell crotch-first
into an open bear trap?

313
00:16:44,323 --> 00:16:46,909
No. He's all man.

314
00:16:47,534 --> 00:16:49,661
So then why are you doing this?

315
00:16:50,245 --> 00:16:51,789
Well, it's very simple.

316
00:16:51,955 --> 00:16:54,750
I like having sex with strangers.

317
00:16:56,168 --> 00:16:57,461
Well, good for you.

318
00:17:00,964 --> 00:17:03,300
Is your husband hiding somewhere
watching us?

319
00:17:03,467 --> 00:17:04,968
No. He's in Dallas on business.

320
00:17:05,135 --> 00:17:07,805
Charlie, are we gonna do this or what?

321
00:17:08,222 --> 00:17:12,017
- Actually, I don't think I can.
- Why not?

322
00:17:12,184 --> 00:17:16,188
Well, I kind of promised my mother
I wouldn't.

323
00:17:16,355 --> 00:17:19,483
- Your mother?
- She's also my friend.

324
00:17:19,775 --> 00:17:21,652
So, what do you wanna do?

325
00:17:23,404 --> 00:17:24,738
Tell you what.

326
00:17:24,905 --> 00:17:26,990
We'll leave it to chance.

327
00:17:28,826 --> 00:17:33,038
If I nail this, then, you know, ditto.

328
00:17:34,873 --> 00:17:35,958
Margaret.

329
00:17:36,125 --> 00:17:38,085
- Oh, God.
- Who's that?

330
00:17:38,252 --> 00:17:40,838
- Who do you think?
- Another stranger?

331
00:17:41,004 --> 00:17:42,089
My husband. Get out.

332
00:17:42,256 --> 00:17:44,007
Right.

333
00:17:45,134 --> 00:17:47,386
- Where the hell should I go?
- Out the window.

334
00:17:47,553 --> 00:17:49,221
I'm not going out the window.

335
00:17:49,388 --> 00:17:51,598
- He's an ex-Marine.
- I'm going out the window.

336
00:17:57,688 --> 00:17:59,857
Oh, damn.

337
00:18:05,404 --> 00:18:08,323
- Hi.
- Sharon?

338
00:18:08,490 --> 00:18:10,909
- What's up?
- I was hoping we could talk.

339
00:18:11,493 --> 00:18:13,203
Oh, sure.

340
00:18:13,370 --> 00:18:14,997
May I come in?

341
00:18:15,706 --> 00:18:17,166
- Okay.
- Thanks.

342
00:18:17,332 --> 00:18:19,501
I'm kind of surprised to see you.

343
00:18:19,668 --> 00:18:22,463
I know.
I behaved really badly the other night.

344
00:18:23,088 --> 00:18:24,798
You were a little emotional.

345
00:18:24,965 --> 00:18:28,010
I wasn't a little emotional.
I was borderline psychotic.

346
00:18:28,677 --> 00:18:31,722
Well, since you brought it up,
I'd say you crossed that border...

347
00:18:31,889 --> 00:18:34,475
with 10 more crazy people
in your trunk.

348
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:36,769
I know. I'm so sorry.

349
00:18:36,935 --> 00:18:38,187
I get like that sometimes.

350
00:18:38,354 --> 00:18:42,399
It's a combination of low self-esteem,
low blood sugar...

351
00:18:42,566 --> 00:18:45,444
and mixing red wine
with my dog's painkillers.

352
00:18:50,824 --> 00:18:54,286
I once took my cold medication
with a mimosa.

353
00:18:54,453 --> 00:18:56,538
Spaced me out the whole day.

354
00:18:56,997 --> 00:18:58,832
- So you forgive me?
- Oh, absolutely.

355
00:18:58,999 --> 00:19:00,709
Oh, thank you, Alan.

356
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:03,587
Don't mention it.

357
00:19:09,551 --> 00:19:10,969
What are we doing?

358
00:19:11,136 --> 00:19:13,138
I'd like to make it up to you.

359
00:19:14,390 --> 00:19:18,394
Do you really think that's a good idea?
Last time it didn't work out so well.

360
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:20,813
Please, Alan,
just give me another chance?

361
00:19:27,444 --> 00:19:29,238
Oh, what the hell.

362
00:19:31,031 --> 00:19:32,991
- I thought you were in Dallas.
- I was.

363
00:19:33,158 --> 00:19:35,536
I got a phone call telling me
to check on my wife.

364
00:19:35,703 --> 00:19:37,079
A phone call? From who?

365
00:19:37,246 --> 00:19:38,539
That's not important.

366
00:19:38,706 --> 00:19:39,790
This marriage is over.

367
00:19:39,957 --> 00:19:41,375
I want you out of my house.

368
00:19:41,542 --> 00:19:42,626
Well, I'm not leaving.

369
00:19:42,793 --> 00:19:44,878
You're gonna have to,
because I'm selling it.

370
00:19:45,045 --> 00:19:46,463
In this market? Are you crazy?

371
00:19:46,630 --> 00:19:47,798
I've got a great realtor.

372
00:19:47,965 --> 00:19:49,883
And she assures me
she can get top dollar.

373
00:19:50,050 --> 00:19:51,802
You've already talked to a realtor?

374
00:19:51,969 --> 00:19:53,679
Who do you think called me in Dallas?

375
00:19:53,846 --> 00:19:55,347
And she's not just my realtor.

376
00:19:55,514 --> 00:19:57,307
She's my friend.

377
00:19:57,474 --> 00:19:59,518
Oh, Mom.

378
00:20:05,357 --> 00:20:06,483
I hate you.

379
00:20:06,650 --> 00:20:09,528
You're a pig, and you used me.

380
00:20:14,783 --> 00:20:16,160
Hey, she's cute.

381
00:20:16,952 --> 00:20:18,495
Yes, she is.

382
00:20:20,414 --> 00:20:24,334
- So how's it going?
- Well, we're trying to make it work.

383
00:20:26,128 --> 00:20:27,171
Good for you.

384
00:20:27,337 --> 00:20:28,589
So how was your night?

385
00:20:28,756 --> 00:20:30,299
You'd be proud of me.

386
00:20:30,466 --> 00:20:32,342
- I took the high road.
- Congratulations.

387
00:20:33,052 --> 00:20:34,094
Didn't matter.

388
00:20:34,261 --> 00:20:36,138
It rarely does.

389
00:20:40,986 --> 00:20:42,612
Wait a minute. You're telling me...

390
00:20:42,779 --> 00:20:45,240
Mom knew you were gonna sleep
with that woman...

391
00:20:45,407 --> 00:20:47,659
and called the husband
so that he'd catch her?

392
00:20:47,826 --> 00:20:48,869
Yep.

393
00:20:49,035 --> 00:20:52,706
The marriage ends and Mom gets
a big commission for selling their house.

394
00:20:53,957 --> 00:20:56,793
She's an evil genius, Alan.

395
00:20:57,836 --> 00:21:01,548
If she lived in Gotham City,
Batman would be toast.

396
00:21:02,716 --> 00:21:05,635
Hey, isn't that your new girlfriend?

397
00:21:05,802 --> 00:21:07,179
Where?

398
00:21:07,345 --> 00:21:09,014
Over there.

399
00:21:09,181 --> 00:21:12,350
Walking into the ocean
with all her clothes on.

400
00:21:13,435 --> 00:21:15,353
Oh, yeah.

401
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:17,856
She gets a little suicidal
after we have sex.

402
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:20,358
Yeah, yeah...

403
00:21:22,027 --> 00:21:25,071
Well, I'd better go pull her in.

404
00:21:29,534 --> 00:21:31,870
Ask if she's got a friend.
