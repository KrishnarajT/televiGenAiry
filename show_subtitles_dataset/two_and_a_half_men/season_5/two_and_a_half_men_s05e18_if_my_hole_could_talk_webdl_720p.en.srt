1
00:00:03,638 --> 00:00:04,890
Got your homework done?

2
00:00:05,891 --> 00:00:07,684
- All of it?
- Yep.

3
00:00:08,768 --> 00:00:10,979
Attaboy.
You just get to kick back this weekend.

4
00:00:11,146 --> 00:00:13,023
That's my plan.

5
00:00:13,190 --> 00:00:14,357
Except...?

6
00:00:14,816 --> 00:00:16,067
Except nothing.

7
00:00:16,902 --> 00:00:17,903
Well, excuse me.

8
00:00:21,448 --> 00:00:23,158
- Oh, yeah.
- There it is.

9
00:00:25,285 --> 00:00:27,412
I might have to write
a book report for Monday.

10
00:00:27,746 --> 00:00:29,539
What do you mean you might have to?

11
00:00:29,706 --> 00:00:31,750
If there's no earthquake
by Monday morning...

12
00:00:31,917 --> 00:00:33,418
I have to write a book report.

13
00:00:33,585 --> 00:00:35,921
Oh, God. So, what's the book?

14
00:00:36,087 --> 00:00:38,507
William Shakespeare's
The Taming Of The Shrew.

15
00:00:38,673 --> 00:00:40,759
By William Shakespeare.

16
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:46,097
That'll come in handy when he's mopping
out the toilets at the House of Pancakes.

17
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:49,434
You know,
I could go for some pancakes.

18
00:00:49,601 --> 00:00:51,561
Jake, please tell me you read the book.

19
00:00:52,270 --> 00:00:53,605
I really wish I could, Dad.

20
00:00:55,982 --> 00:00:57,901
I was gonna read it, but I can't find it.

21
00:00:58,068 --> 00:00:59,319
You lost the book?

22
00:00:59,486 --> 00:01:01,404
What do you intend to do
about the report?

23
00:01:01,571 --> 00:01:03,531
You mean aside from the earthquake?

24
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:06,117
Yeah.

25
00:01:06,284 --> 00:01:09,537
Well, I kind of put all my eggs
in the earthquake basket.

26
00:01:09,955 --> 00:01:11,706
Get dressed. We're going to the store.

27
00:01:11,873 --> 00:01:13,625
- Well, can we stop for pancakes?
- Go.

28
00:01:16,044 --> 00:01:20,048
I bet you're sorry you took
all that LSD before you had him.

29
00:01:22,092 --> 00:01:23,551
I never took any LSD.

30
00:01:24,177 --> 00:01:26,554
You might wanna start
telling people you did.

31
00:01:35,273 --> 00:01:37,984
Unbelievable. You had four weeks
to write this book report.

32
00:01:38,150 --> 00:01:40,278
Get over it, Dad.

33
00:01:41,362 --> 00:01:42,405
Yeah, Alan. Relax.

34
00:01:42,571 --> 00:01:45,157
He'll have eight weeks
of summer school to do it.

35
00:01:45,658 --> 00:01:47,284
Unless there's an earthquake.

36
00:01:49,203 --> 00:01:52,498
Excuse me, could you tell me
where the classic literature section is?

37
00:01:52,665 --> 00:01:55,001
- Third floor near the restroom.
- Thank you.

38
00:01:55,167 --> 00:01:56,961
Go ahead. I'm gonna look at magazines.

39
00:01:57,128 --> 00:02:00,423
They don't sell those kinds of magazines
here. I checked.

40
00:02:01,841 --> 00:02:03,843
Come on, you little perv.
Meet me back here.

41
00:02:04,885 --> 00:02:07,888
Wait, was that an earthquake?

42
00:02:10,725 --> 00:02:12,518
Can I help you find anything?

43
00:02:12,685 --> 00:02:14,645
Yeah, I'm looking for a book.

44
00:02:17,857 --> 00:02:19,650
You probably need more than that.

45
00:02:19,817 --> 00:02:22,653
I want a book about,
you know, relationship stuff.

46
00:02:23,654 --> 00:02:25,531
Relationship stuff.

47
00:02:25,698 --> 00:02:29,994
No, not "relationship stuff,"
just relationship stuff.

48
00:02:30,369 --> 00:02:31,829
In the self-help section.

49
00:02:32,705 --> 00:02:35,499
- Thanks.
- Best of luck.

50
00:02:38,836 --> 00:02:41,172
This is worse than buying condoms.

51
00:02:42,882 --> 00:02:44,550
Okay, let's see.

52
00:02:44,717 --> 00:02:46,677
"Why Relationships Fail."

53
00:02:47,636 --> 00:02:49,722
"Smart Women, Foolish Choices."

54
00:02:50,431 --> 00:02:52,558
Thank God for those gals.

55
00:02:53,058 --> 00:02:54,727
- Excuse me.
- Sorry.

56
00:02:54,894 --> 00:02:56,520
Oh, "Embracing Your Soul Mate."

57
00:02:57,396 --> 00:03:00,900
Oh, "soul mate."
I thought it was "cellmate."

58
00:03:02,401 --> 00:03:04,111
You know, a prison love story?

59
00:03:04,528 --> 00:03:05,571
I see.

60
00:03:05,905 --> 00:03:08,115
Not that I'm into prison love stories.

61
00:03:08,282 --> 00:03:09,867
I like the girls-in-prison stuff.

62
00:03:11,911 --> 00:03:14,079
Oh, who am I kidding?

63
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:16,207
I'm looking for some help, okay?

64
00:03:16,916 --> 00:03:20,085
You're not alone. There are
millions of people looking for help.

65
00:03:20,252 --> 00:03:22,755
Gee, thanks for making me feel special.

66
00:03:24,173 --> 00:03:25,674
Let me ask you something.

67
00:03:25,841 --> 00:03:28,719
What would you change about yourself
if you could?

68
00:03:28,886 --> 00:03:31,305
- I don't know, little things, I guess.
- Like what?

69
00:03:32,014 --> 00:03:34,099
Well,
I guess I'd like to be a little happier.

70
00:03:34,266 --> 00:03:37,353
Maybe find a way to sustain
a healthy relationship with a woman...

71
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:40,439
so I don't,
you know, grow old and die alone...

72
00:03:40,606 --> 00:03:42,983
incontinent and unloved.

73
00:03:44,109 --> 00:03:46,779
Yes, the little things.

74
00:03:46,946 --> 00:03:48,405
Can I recommend a book for you?

75
00:03:49,031 --> 00:03:50,241
Well, as long as I'm here.

76
00:03:56,539 --> 00:04:00,626
"Breaking Barriers:
Finding The Intimacy You Deserve."

77
00:04:00,793 --> 00:04:03,837
I don't know.
I was hoping to do better than I deserve.

78
00:04:04,004 --> 00:04:06,465
Give it a chance.
I hear it's helped a lot of people.

79
00:04:06,882 --> 00:04:09,009
For 25 bucks, it better wash my car.

80
00:04:12,638 --> 00:04:14,473
Wait a minute, is this you?

81
00:04:15,015 --> 00:04:16,767
Armor All's extra.

82
00:04:16,934 --> 00:04:20,604
- Cool. Will you sign it for me?
- Oh, I'd be happy to. What's your name?

83
00:04:20,771 --> 00:04:23,732
- Charlie.
- Okay.

84
00:04:24,066 --> 00:04:25,109
Great.

85
00:04:25,276 --> 00:04:28,654
Now, that it's autographed,
I'm not a loser, I'm a collector.

86
00:04:29,989 --> 00:04:31,615
Here you go.

87
00:04:33,033 --> 00:04:37,830
"To Charlie, reading a self-help book
doesn't make you less of a man."

88
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:40,624
Okay, back to loser.

89
00:04:41,458 --> 00:04:42,501
You're not a loser.

90
00:04:42,668 --> 00:04:45,004
Like most men,
you're just afraid to be vulnerable.

91
00:04:45,170 --> 00:04:48,340
Excuse me, but what sane person
wants to be vulnerable?

92
00:04:49,008 --> 00:04:51,302
If you're not vulnerable,
you can't feel anything.

93
00:04:51,468 --> 00:04:53,137
Yeah, and?

94
00:04:54,013 --> 00:04:55,055
Read the book.

95
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:58,309
Wait.

96
00:04:58,726 --> 00:05:00,227
Can I buy you a cup of coffee?

97
00:05:00,602 --> 00:05:02,980
- Why?
- I'd like to talk to you some more.

98
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:05,441
Are you still gonna buy the book?

99
00:05:05,607 --> 00:05:08,068
I have to. You wrote all over it.

100
00:05:09,069 --> 00:05:10,904
- Then sure, why not?
- Great.

101
00:05:11,530 --> 00:05:13,574
If I give you the money,
will you pay for it?

102
00:05:13,741 --> 00:05:16,577
I don't need any more sympathy
from the help.

103
00:05:17,536 --> 00:05:18,871
What's a shrew anyway?

104
00:05:19,038 --> 00:05:20,664
Oh, it's a small rodent.

105
00:05:20,831 --> 00:05:22,708
Oh, so this is like Stuart Little?

106
00:05:23,208 --> 00:05:27,337
No, no, it's about a man
trying to control a willful, angry woman.

107
00:05:27,504 --> 00:05:29,882
Is he trying to control her with rodents?

108
00:05:31,592 --> 00:05:33,218
I don't wanna spoil it for you.

109
00:05:33,802 --> 00:05:36,805
Let's just find your Uncle Charlie
and get out of here.

110
00:05:36,972 --> 00:05:41,518
Excuse me, have you seen a guy,
dark hair, bowling shirt, shorts?

111
00:05:41,685 --> 00:05:43,520
Oh, yeah, the self-help guy.

112
00:05:43,687 --> 00:05:45,272
No, that doesn't sound like him.

113
00:05:45,439 --> 00:05:47,900
A guy like that just left
with a pretty blond woman.

114
00:05:48,067 --> 00:05:50,110
That sounds like him.

115
00:05:50,736 --> 00:05:52,112
Dad, this is the wrong book.

116
00:05:52,696 --> 00:05:55,866
- What are you talking about?
- It's in some sort of foreign language.

117
00:05:56,033 --> 00:05:57,785
It's Elizabethan.

118
00:05:57,951 --> 00:05:59,787
Well, can we get one in English?

119
00:06:00,913 --> 00:06:02,664
Walk.

120
00:06:07,044 --> 00:06:09,463
How could you
have already lost the book?

121
00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:12,299
I didn't do it on purpose.
What are you yelling at me for?

122
00:06:12,466 --> 00:06:15,761
Because it's one of the few pleasures
of being your father.

123
00:06:17,429 --> 00:06:21,225
- Oh, look who's here. Thanks a lot.
- What did I do?

124
00:06:21,391 --> 00:06:23,769
You stranded us at the mall.
We had to take the bus.

125
00:06:23,936 --> 00:06:28,440
The bus, I left the book on the bus.
There, mystery solved.

126
00:06:29,441 --> 00:06:30,442
Go get in the car.

127
00:06:30,818 --> 00:06:33,612
- Where are we going?
- Where do you think we're going?

128
00:06:34,112 --> 00:06:36,782
Well, we never did get those pancakes.

129
00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:40,202
We're going to the bookstore
to buy another book.

130
00:06:40,369 --> 00:06:43,080
- This one's coming out of your allowance.
- What allowance?

131
00:06:45,791 --> 00:06:49,461
- I'm supposed to be getting an allowance?
- Go get your shoes.

132
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:56,969
- Did you guys feel that?
- Move it.

133
00:07:01,515 --> 00:07:02,683
So guess what.

134
00:07:02,849 --> 00:07:06,311
I'm gonna transform my life
and get the intimacy I deserve.

135
00:07:06,853 --> 00:07:07,896
Fantastic.

136
00:07:08,063 --> 00:07:10,941
You work on that while
I go back to the mall with taterhead.

137
00:07:12,401 --> 00:07:15,445
Not only that,
I met the author and she's amazing.

138
00:07:15,612 --> 00:07:18,323
- The woman you dumped us for?
- Yeah, know what she told me?

139
00:07:18,490 --> 00:07:19,700
No idea.

140
00:07:19,866 --> 00:07:23,745
She told me that my fear of being hurt
keeps me from feeling anything at all.

141
00:07:23,912 --> 00:07:26,957
It's like I'm living in an emotional prison
that I built myself.

142
00:07:27,124 --> 00:07:29,668
How about that? You abandoned us.

143
00:07:30,294 --> 00:07:31,670
I know, but get this.

144
00:07:31,837 --> 00:07:34,381
I'm not just a prisoner, I'm the warden.

145
00:07:36,758 --> 00:07:40,095
We had to take two buses and walk a mile
on the Pacific Coast Highway...

146
00:07:40,262 --> 00:07:41,471
during rush hour.

147
00:07:42,014 --> 00:07:44,099
I get it. I understand.

148
00:07:44,266 --> 00:07:48,020
But the good news is
I hold the keys to my own freedom.

149
00:07:48,895 --> 00:07:52,190
There's no sidewalk
on the Pacific Coast highway.

150
00:07:53,442 --> 00:07:55,485
Okay, okay, I hear you.

151
00:07:55,652 --> 00:07:57,195
You're angry and resentful.

152
00:07:57,362 --> 00:07:59,031
But what you need to understand...

153
00:07:59,197 --> 00:08:03,035
is that resentment is the mortar that
holds the bricks of Ioneliness together...

154
00:08:03,201 --> 00:08:05,203
in a wall of alienation and despair.

155
00:08:07,247 --> 00:08:10,334
Chapter 3, "Knocking Down the Wall."

156
00:08:11,376 --> 00:08:13,003
Bite me.

157
00:08:14,671 --> 00:08:18,383
That's Chapter 1 in my forthcoming book
entitled Bite Me.

158
00:08:20,218 --> 00:08:23,013
Chapter 2 is called,
"Kiss My Pale White Ass."

159
00:08:24,890 --> 00:08:27,267
- We can't go back to the mall.
- Why not?

160
00:08:27,434 --> 00:08:28,894
My shoes are missing.

161
00:08:32,898 --> 00:08:34,399
Another mystery solved.

162
00:08:37,069 --> 00:08:38,111
Wrong foot, buddy.

163
00:08:40,322 --> 00:08:41,364
Oh, yeah, thanks.

164
00:08:42,866 --> 00:08:44,951
Guess I should be reading
Taming of the Shoe.

165
00:08:47,454 --> 00:08:48,914
Get it?

166
00:08:51,166 --> 00:08:54,211
You might wanna start thinking
about having him neutered.

167
00:09:00,217 --> 00:09:01,760
This is delicious.

168
00:09:01,927 --> 00:09:03,762
I've never had Ethiopian food before.

169
00:09:04,763 --> 00:09:06,890
I've loved it
ever since I lived in Ethiopia.

170
00:09:08,141 --> 00:09:09,768
When did you live there?

171
00:09:10,268 --> 00:09:11,645
Let's see.

172
00:09:11,812 --> 00:09:13,605
It would have to be 1972.

173
00:09:14,606 --> 00:09:17,400
1972? Were you born there?

174
00:09:18,652 --> 00:09:22,405
Don't be silly. This was right after college.
I was in the Peace Corps.

175
00:09:24,449 --> 00:09:27,577
College, 1972.

176
00:09:28,119 --> 00:09:29,162
Need a pencil?

177
00:09:30,872 --> 00:09:32,624
No, no, no.

178
00:09:32,791 --> 00:09:36,294
I was just thinking
what I was doing in 1972.

179
00:09:36,461 --> 00:09:37,754
Oh, tell me.

180
00:09:38,922 --> 00:09:40,590
I don't have a vivid memory of it...

181
00:09:40,757 --> 00:09:44,010
but I'm sure that's the year
I graduated to the big-boy potty.

182
00:09:46,221 --> 00:09:47,848
It was quite a year for both of us.

183
00:09:50,517 --> 00:09:53,019
So are you still using
that college degree?

184
00:09:53,186 --> 00:09:55,814
Because I'm still using
the big-boy potty.

185
00:09:57,357 --> 00:10:00,277
You're used to going out
with younger women, aren't you?

186
00:10:00,735 --> 00:10:04,990
Well, I don't really think about age
as much as I think about personality...

187
00:10:05,156 --> 00:10:10,620
and, you know,
chemistry and education, family values.

188
00:10:12,872 --> 00:10:15,333
All right, young and dumb,
you got me.

189
00:10:17,335 --> 00:10:20,839
I'm not judging you, Charlie. You're a man
and you know what you want.

190
00:10:21,006 --> 00:10:22,924
What's wrong with that?

191
00:10:23,758 --> 00:10:25,135
Nothing?

192
00:10:25,510 --> 00:10:26,803
Nothing.

193
00:10:26,970 --> 00:10:29,306
You are fine just the way you are.

194
00:10:30,307 --> 00:10:33,143
- I am?
- Of course, you are.

195
00:10:35,228 --> 00:10:38,023
If I called my mother now,
would you tell her that?

196
00:10:39,149 --> 00:10:40,692
You don't think she knows?

197
00:10:40,859 --> 00:10:42,193
As far as she's concerned...

198
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:45,530
the last thing I did right
was evacuate her uterus.

199
00:10:45,697 --> 00:10:48,658
Oh, you poor thing. That's awful.

200
00:10:48,825 --> 00:10:50,160
It is, isn't it?

201
00:10:50,535 --> 00:10:53,413
Every little boy
needs to feel loved and nurtured.

202
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:57,917
Otherwise, he grows up with a hole
inside him that he can never fill.

203
00:10:58,084 --> 00:11:01,379
Oh, I have got such a big hole.

204
00:11:01,546 --> 00:11:03,798
If my hole could talk.

205
00:11:05,592 --> 00:11:07,510
You've got a little something
right here.

206
00:11:10,513 --> 00:11:12,223
I'll get it.

207
00:11:15,602 --> 00:11:17,520
- There we go.
- Thanks.

208
00:11:18,355 --> 00:11:19,689
You know what?

209
00:11:20,565 --> 00:11:21,691
I like you.

210
00:11:22,484 --> 00:11:25,070
Well, I like you too, Charlie.

211
00:11:28,073 --> 00:11:29,574
Try the Yemiser Kik Wat.

212
00:11:31,493 --> 00:11:32,744
Looks kind of yucky.

213
00:11:33,244 --> 00:11:35,372
Well, don't look at it. Just taste it.

214
00:11:36,748 --> 00:11:39,250
Oh, come on, just one bite. For me?

215
00:11:43,713 --> 00:11:45,298
Okay.

216
00:11:51,096 --> 00:11:52,597
Hey, it's good.

217
00:11:52,764 --> 00:11:54,224
I told you.

218
00:11:54,390 --> 00:11:57,393
Oh, excuse me.
Could I get another napkin?

219
00:12:02,107 --> 00:12:04,192
So, what do they have for dessert?

220
00:12:07,779 --> 00:12:10,865
Well, Charlie,
thank you for a lovely evening.

221
00:12:11,032 --> 00:12:12,867
You're welcome.

222
00:12:15,787 --> 00:12:18,456
Can I kiss you good night?

223
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:21,626
Do you usually ask permission?

224
00:12:22,168 --> 00:12:23,628
Well, no.

225
00:12:24,295 --> 00:12:26,256
Then why are you asking now?

226
00:12:26,881 --> 00:12:29,968
I don't know.
I don't wanna get in trouble.

227
00:12:38,393 --> 00:12:39,602
Okay, I'm in trouble.

228
00:12:43,982 --> 00:12:45,984
Oh, I'm sorry.
I thought I heard something.

229
00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:47,777
It's okay. Jeremy, this is Charlie.

230
00:12:47,944 --> 00:12:50,280
- Charlie, this is my son, Jeremy.
- Hey, man.

231
00:12:50,446 --> 00:12:51,948
- How are you?
- How's it going?

232
00:12:52,115 --> 00:12:55,034
I didn't mean to interrupt.
I dropped in to fix your computer.

233
00:12:55,201 --> 00:12:57,620
I'll leave you two alone.
Charlie, good meeting you.

234
00:12:57,787 --> 00:12:59,247
Same here.

235
00:13:01,332 --> 00:13:03,001
So that's your son?

236
00:13:04,419 --> 00:13:06,170
- How old is he?
- Thirty-two.

237
00:13:08,256 --> 00:13:09,632
They're cute at that age.

238
00:13:29,228 --> 00:13:31,313
- Hey.
- What?

239
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:33,774
You're supposed
to be finishing your report.

240
00:13:33,941 --> 00:13:36,235
I know, but I can't find the book.

241
00:13:39,196 --> 00:13:41,490
You're kidding. We just bought it.

242
00:13:41,657 --> 00:13:42,825
What can I say, Dad?

243
00:13:42,991 --> 00:13:45,244
It's a big house and a little book.

244
00:13:46,453 --> 00:13:48,997
Find the book.

245
00:13:49,581 --> 00:13:53,085
- I'm really tired.
- Find the book.

246
00:13:54,670 --> 00:13:56,755
Just saying it won't make it happen.

247
00:13:58,924 --> 00:14:02,511
Find the book!

248
00:14:04,847 --> 00:14:06,098
Heads up. He's losing it.

249
00:14:07,307 --> 00:14:09,309
I should have put frosting
on the damn book.

250
00:14:09,476 --> 00:14:11,937
He's never lost anything
with frosting on it.

251
00:14:12,604 --> 00:14:15,607
I don't know why you continue
to bang your head against the wall.

252
00:14:15,774 --> 00:14:19,611
The kid's obviously destined to sell
tube socks out of the trunk of his car.

253
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:23,740
A business of his own.

254
00:14:23,907 --> 00:14:26,118
Gee, that'd be swell.

255
00:14:28,036 --> 00:14:31,999
- So how was your date?
- Terrific.

256
00:14:32,165 --> 00:14:36,128
- Then why are you home so early?
- Well, turns out she has a kid.

257
00:14:36,295 --> 00:14:37,462
Single mom, huh?

258
00:14:38,422 --> 00:14:39,965
Yeah.

259
00:14:40,966 --> 00:14:43,302
That's what she is, single mom.

260
00:14:43,468 --> 00:14:45,304
- How old?
- Thirty-two.

261
00:14:45,470 --> 00:14:47,806
- I meant the kid.
- So did I.

262
00:14:48,307 --> 00:14:49,308
You're kidding.

263
00:14:49,474 --> 00:14:51,977
If she's got a 32-year-old kid
that would make her...

264
00:14:52,144 --> 00:14:53,937
Don't do the math, please.

265
00:14:54,104 --> 00:14:56,023
It all goes south
when you do the math.

266
00:14:56,815 --> 00:14:59,735
Come on, so you're dating
an older woman. It's no big deal.

267
00:14:59,901 --> 00:15:02,195
That's it?
You're not gonna give me a hard time?

268
00:15:02,362 --> 00:15:04,489
Don't be silly.
I'm more evolved than that.

269
00:15:05,157 --> 00:15:06,658
Well, good.

270
00:15:07,743 --> 00:15:11,163
Just a gigolo
Everywhere I go

271
00:15:11,330 --> 00:15:15,042
People know the part
I'm playing

272
00:15:15,667 --> 00:15:17,419
I guess I'm not.

273
00:15:18,503 --> 00:15:20,339
Look, this is a spectacular woman...

274
00:15:20,505 --> 00:15:23,008
and it doesn't matter in the least
how old she is.

275
00:15:23,175 --> 00:15:26,011
Please. You can't even tolerate age spots
on a banana.

276
00:15:27,429 --> 00:15:33,685
Okay, okay, first of all, on a banana,
spots are an indication of mushiness.

277
00:15:33,852 --> 00:15:38,190
And second,
I haven't peeled this woman yet.

278
00:15:45,697 --> 00:15:47,199
In the freezer?

279
00:15:48,241 --> 00:15:51,495
- Jake.
- I found it, I'm reading.

280
00:15:51,661 --> 00:15:53,705
It's really cool.

281
00:16:06,968 --> 00:16:10,055
- For God's sake.
- Hey, I was reading that.

282
00:16:10,222 --> 00:16:12,641
You're writing a report
on The Taming of The Shrew...

283
00:16:12,808 --> 00:16:14,559
not the voyages of Cap'n Crunch.

284
00:16:14,893 --> 00:16:17,562
Too bad.
I could write the crap out of that.

285
00:16:20,565 --> 00:16:25,028
Okay, I'm not fooling around here.

286
00:16:25,195 --> 00:16:29,032
You're gonna finish this damn book
and write the damn report...

287
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:31,535
you're gonna hand it in Monday,
spell-checked...

288
00:16:31,701 --> 00:16:34,412
formatted and on freaking time.

289
00:16:35,288 --> 00:16:37,582
I have my doubts, Dad.

290
00:16:39,543 --> 00:16:42,254
- Read.
- Fine.

291
00:16:45,590 --> 00:16:46,633
Listen to this.

292
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,635
"A sleeve? 'Tis like a demi-cannon:

293
00:16:48,802 --> 00:16:51,930
What! Up and down,
carv'd like an apple-tart?"

294
00:16:52,097 --> 00:16:54,766
All I get from this is
"blah, blah, blah, apple tart."

295
00:16:56,685 --> 00:16:58,603
Have we got any apple tarts?

296
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:04,317
- Hi.
- Hi.

297
00:17:07,821 --> 00:17:08,864
Good.

298
00:17:09,030 --> 00:17:11,783
I was afraid that first kiss
might have been a fluke.

299
00:17:11,950 --> 00:17:14,828
Well, I don't know about you,
but that was not my first kiss.

300
00:17:15,245 --> 00:17:16,830
Come on in.

301
00:17:17,414 --> 00:17:19,457
Wow, what a beautiful home.

302
00:17:20,375 --> 00:17:22,002
Thank you.

303
00:17:24,129 --> 00:17:25,881
How much of it do you wanna see?

304
00:17:29,175 --> 00:17:31,219
This'll be enough for today.

305
00:17:31,887 --> 00:17:33,638
Understood. Let's hit the road.

306
00:17:33,805 --> 00:17:35,515
Aren't you gonna take a jacket?

307
00:17:35,682 --> 00:17:36,850
I'm okay, don't need one.

308
00:17:37,017 --> 00:17:40,312
- It gets cool in Santa Barbara, Charlie.
- I'll be fine.

309
00:17:40,478 --> 00:17:43,773
Please. If you don't need it,
you can leave it in the car.

310
00:17:44,691 --> 00:17:46,234
All right.

311
00:17:47,569 --> 00:17:50,447
- Take a look around.
- Thanks, I will.

312
00:17:51,531 --> 00:17:54,492
Oh, hi, you must be Angie.

313
00:17:54,659 --> 00:17:56,328
I'm Alan, Charlie's brother.

314
00:17:56,494 --> 00:17:58,663
Oh, of course, hi.
Oh, what a firm handshake.

315
00:17:58,830 --> 00:18:01,875
Oh, well, no one trusts
a chiropractor with limp hands.

316
00:18:02,042 --> 00:18:03,335
Oh, you're a chiropractor?

317
00:18:04,002 --> 00:18:06,338
Hang on.
I could have gotten into medical school.

318
00:18:06,504 --> 00:18:08,882
I didn't wanna spend
four years in South America.

319
00:18:09,049 --> 00:18:12,552
- No, no, I'm a big fan of chiropractics.
- You're kidding.

320
00:18:12,719 --> 00:18:15,013
No, I think you people
are miracle workers.

321
00:18:15,722 --> 00:18:17,349
Okay, I'm ready to go.

322
00:18:18,058 --> 00:18:20,185
Did you put on sun block?

323
00:18:20,518 --> 00:18:21,603
I don't need sun block.

324
00:18:21,770 --> 00:18:23,605
Oh, honey, I think you do.

325
00:18:23,772 --> 00:18:26,691
You have beautiful skin.
I don't wanna see it get burned.

326
00:18:26,858 --> 00:18:28,860
You're right, thanks.

327
00:18:29,444 --> 00:18:34,866
So anyway, you were saying something
about me being a miracle worker?

328
00:18:35,033 --> 00:18:37,494
Oh, God, yes.
I threw my back out last year skiing.

329
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:41,539
- My chiropractor just about saved my life.
- That's what we do, you know.

330
00:18:41,706 --> 00:18:45,043
We're not flashy, we don't get,
you know, special license plates...

331
00:18:45,210 --> 00:18:47,420
so we can park
wherever the hell we want.

332
00:18:47,587 --> 00:18:49,798
You know,
nobody makes TV shows about us.

333
00:18:49,964 --> 00:18:54,761
Or calls us McDreamy
or McSteamy or McMuffin.

334
00:18:56,554 --> 00:18:58,890
We just quietly go about
the business of healing.

335
00:18:59,057 --> 00:19:00,809
- I know, I know.
- Thank you, thank you.

336
00:19:00,975 --> 00:19:02,977
I only wish more people appreciated us.

337
00:19:03,395 --> 00:19:05,271
You can't worry about
what people think.

338
00:19:05,438 --> 00:19:08,733
I know, but the lack of respect
really hurts, you know.

339
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:13,238
Back-cracker, spine-cruncher,
quack, charlatan, witch doctor...

340
00:19:13,405 --> 00:19:15,865
- Alan.
voodoo priest, fraud, failure.

341
00:19:16,032 --> 00:19:17,742
Hey, hey.

342
00:19:18,451 --> 00:19:20,578
Know what we call people
who say those things?

343
00:19:20,745 --> 00:19:21,913
My family?

344
00:19:22,747 --> 00:19:23,998
We call them damaged.

345
00:19:24,165 --> 00:19:26,835
They need to hurt others
to feel better about themselves.

346
00:19:27,001 --> 00:19:29,546
Exactly, the reason
I don't feel better about myself...

347
00:19:29,712 --> 00:19:32,090
is I'm not good enough
at hurting them back.

348
00:19:32,549 --> 00:19:34,300
Oh, no, you don't wanna do that.

349
00:19:34,676 --> 00:19:36,594
Yeah, I kind of do.

350
00:19:36,970 --> 00:19:41,599
Alan, you need to ignore the negativity
and open yourself up...

351
00:19:41,766 --> 00:19:44,144
to the nurturing love
that's all around you.

352
00:19:44,644 --> 00:19:47,105
- Love is all around me?
- Yes.

353
00:19:47,272 --> 00:19:50,275
Is it hiding
behind the loathing and rejection?

354
00:19:50,942 --> 00:19:54,112
Honey, I am loving you right now.

355
00:19:54,821 --> 00:19:57,365
- Really?
- Yes, really.

356
00:19:59,117 --> 00:20:00,493
Thank you.

357
00:20:04,581 --> 00:20:07,375
You are a wonderful,
valuable human being.

358
00:20:07,959 --> 00:20:09,669
I am?

359
00:20:10,211 --> 00:20:11,796
Yes, you are.

360
00:20:19,137 --> 00:20:21,556
I see you're getting to know
my brother.

361
00:20:27,914 --> 00:20:29,457
Isn't this beautiful country?

362
00:20:30,124 --> 00:20:32,502
Yeah, it's swell.

363
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:36,797
Angie, if you like antiquing,
I know some great little shops.

364
00:20:36,964 --> 00:20:39,425
- I'm not going antiquing.
- Oh, that's okay.

365
00:20:39,592 --> 00:20:42,803
Angie and I will peel off
and you can sit in the park and drink.

366
00:20:43,971 --> 00:20:46,015
Are there any game arcades
in Santa Barbara?

367
00:20:46,182 --> 00:20:48,309
You won't have time.
You have a book to read.

368
00:20:48,476 --> 00:20:50,269
Oh, yeah.

369
00:20:50,686 --> 00:20:52,647
I forgot it.

370
00:20:53,397 --> 00:20:55,274
That's okay.
We can stop at a bookstore.

371
00:20:55,441 --> 00:20:57,693
Oh, gee,
we don't want to ruin your afternoon.

372
00:20:57,860 --> 00:21:00,112
Hey, we invited you.
We want you with us.

373
00:21:00,279 --> 00:21:02,323
- Right, Charlie?
- No.

374
00:21:02,490 --> 00:21:04,700
Oh, don't be that way.

375
00:21:05,159 --> 00:21:08,496
I tell you what, after we get Jake's book,
we'll stop and get ice cream.

376
00:21:08,663 --> 00:21:10,206
Yes.
