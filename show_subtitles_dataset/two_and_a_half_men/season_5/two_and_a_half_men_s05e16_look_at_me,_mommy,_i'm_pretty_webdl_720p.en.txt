1
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:06,204
So I'm thinking we serve the good wine
before the ceremony...

2
00:00:06,371 --> 00:00:09,374
and then at the reception,
after everybody's got a buzz on...

3
00:00:09,541 --> 00:00:11,626
we uncork the crap.

4
00:00:12,502 --> 00:00:17,257
Alan, I do not want to cheap out on
what is very possibly my last wedding.

5
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:20,218
He's always been stingy.

6
00:00:20,385 --> 00:00:23,972
I remember once when he was a little
boy, he accidentally swallowed a quarter.

7
00:00:24,139 --> 00:00:26,558
Refused to poop for a week.

8
00:00:27,559 --> 00:00:30,395
Mom, for God's sakes,
this is my future stepsister.

9
00:00:30,562 --> 00:00:32,898
Oh, relax, Alan. I think it's cute.

10
00:00:33,064 --> 00:00:37,235
Cute? He's so tight, I wouldn't have been
surprised if only two dimes came out.

11
00:00:39,529 --> 00:00:41,573
Mom, I'm begging you.

12
00:00:42,365 --> 00:00:45,494
Would you feel better if I told you
something embarrassing about me?

13
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:47,412
- Yes.
- Promise not to laugh?

14
00:00:48,038 --> 00:00:50,332
- I promise.
- All right.

15
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:54,461
I have never in my life refused to poop.

16
00:01:00,175 --> 00:01:03,428
You are so mean. I love you.

17
00:01:04,304 --> 00:01:06,890
I think I liked it better
when you two didn't get along.

18
00:01:07,057 --> 00:01:08,433
Well, those days are over.

19
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:12,270
Once I saw how happy Evy makes
my father, I could've married her myself.

20
00:01:12,437 --> 00:01:16,107
Oh, thank you, sweetheart.
And you're like the daughter I never had.

21
00:01:16,274 --> 00:01:17,525
Not that he didn't try.

22
00:01:21,279 --> 00:01:24,908
You should have seen him parading
around in my earrings and my high heels.

23
00:01:25,075 --> 00:01:27,118
"Look at me, Mommy, I'm pretty."

24
00:01:29,788 --> 00:01:30,956
He wasn't, of course.

25
00:01:33,959 --> 00:01:36,753
Oh, darling, I'm just teasing you.

26
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:38,129
You're all man.

27
00:01:39,464 --> 00:01:40,924
Thanks.

28
00:01:41,091 --> 00:01:42,550
Okay, let's talk appetizers.

29
00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:47,764
Hey, Alan, how long do I have
before Bridezilla gets here?

30
00:01:48,181 --> 00:01:51,810
Gee, Charlie,
I don't know what you're talking about.

31
00:01:51,977 --> 00:01:54,020
She's already here, isn't she?

32
00:01:54,187 --> 00:01:56,022
Yes, dear. Come on down.

33
00:01:57,023 --> 00:01:58,316
It's a little game we play.

34
00:01:58,483 --> 00:02:01,695
I show him unconditional love,
and he's an ungrateful little pissant.

35
00:02:04,864 --> 00:02:06,491
- Hey, Mom.
- Hello, dear.

36
00:02:06,658 --> 00:02:08,660
You remember Teddy's daughter,
Courtney?

37
00:02:08,827 --> 00:02:10,495
How could I forget?

38
00:02:10,662 --> 00:02:13,164
- Nice to see you again.
- Nice to see you too.

39
00:02:14,249 --> 00:02:17,502
Courtney and your brother are helping
me with the wedding arrangements.

40
00:02:17,669 --> 00:02:21,881
It's your fifth wedding, Mom.
What do you need help with?

41
00:02:22,507 --> 00:02:24,843
Besides remembering the groom's name?

42
00:02:25,927 --> 00:02:30,181
I'd cut him out of the will if I thought
there was a chance he'd outlive me.

43
00:02:32,392 --> 00:02:35,186
Hello? Oh, Teddy, darling.

44
00:02:35,353 --> 00:02:37,021
What's up?

45
00:02:37,731 --> 00:02:39,023
Excuse me.

46
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:42,277
That's wonderful.
Can you keep it up till I get there?

47
00:02:44,487 --> 00:02:47,365
All right, I want to make sure
we're all on the same page here.

48
00:02:47,532 --> 00:02:49,701
This wedding will be ruined
if Mom finds out...

49
00:02:49,868 --> 00:02:53,204
her son and future stepdaughter
have been carrying on behind her back.

50
00:02:53,371 --> 00:02:54,622
- Don't worry.
- She won't.

51
00:02:54,789 --> 00:02:58,084
No, I do worry.
There can be no flirting, no innuendo.

52
00:02:59,461 --> 00:03:03,006
Don't worry about "innuendo,"
worry about "in-her-end-o."

53
00:03:05,467 --> 00:03:08,219
Everybody keeps their troublemakers
in their pants.

54
00:03:08,386 --> 00:03:11,222
Hey, I'll cooperate,
but I can't speak for my troublemaker.

55
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:16,102
Alan, Teddy wants to talk to you
about the boutonnieres.

56
00:03:16,269 --> 00:03:18,146
Coming.

57
00:03:18,313 --> 00:03:20,440
I knew he'd fight me on this.

58
00:03:23,067 --> 00:03:25,737
So when can we get together?

59
00:03:25,904 --> 00:03:28,448
We can't. You and I are done.

60
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:32,619
Why? Just because of what Alan said?
Nobody listens to Alan.

61
00:03:32,785 --> 00:03:35,705
Hell, half the time,
Alan doesn't listen to Alan.

62
00:03:35,872 --> 00:03:39,250
I finally have a good relationship
with your mother. I'd like to keep it.

63
00:03:39,417 --> 00:03:42,754
Hey, a good relationship with my mother
is highly overrated.

64
00:03:42,921 --> 00:03:45,757
Look at me,
I've gone my whole life without one.

65
00:03:45,924 --> 00:03:50,261
Charlie, get it through your head.
You and I, no more.

66
00:03:53,348 --> 00:03:57,769
If it were that simple,
they wouldn't call it "troublemaker."

67
00:04:06,962 --> 00:04:10,423
I'd like to make a little toast.
To our families coming together.

68
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:11,800
Hear, hear.

69
00:04:11,967 --> 00:04:14,427
- To coming together.
- No.

70
00:04:15,762 --> 00:04:19,140
Evelyn is gaining a daughter
and I'm gaining two sons.

71
00:04:19,307 --> 00:04:21,977
- And a grandson.
- Don't interrupt.

72
00:04:22,394 --> 00:04:26,356
I'd like to say something else. I want
this to be an old-fashioned marriage.

73
00:04:26,523 --> 00:04:29,734
Darling, what's mine is yours.

74
00:04:29,901 --> 00:04:31,319
We do not need a prenup.

75
00:04:32,654 --> 00:04:34,906
Teddy, we've talked about this.

76
00:04:35,073 --> 00:04:37,993
You have a lot of money.
You should be protected.

77
00:04:38,159 --> 00:04:40,203
I don't need to be protected
from you, baby.

78
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:42,789
- Daddy, wait a minute.
- This is none of your business.

79
00:04:42,956 --> 00:04:45,333
- But, Dad.
- But nothing.

80
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:47,085
I love this woman.

81
00:04:47,252 --> 00:04:49,254
And I'm not gonna bet
against our marriage...

82
00:04:49,421 --> 00:04:51,298
by bringing a bunch of lawyers
into it.

83
00:04:55,051 --> 00:04:57,220
- He must really love her.
- Yeah.

84
00:04:57,387 --> 00:04:58,847
The schmuck.

85
00:05:01,016 --> 00:05:02,767
Excuse me.

86
00:05:09,941 --> 00:05:12,611
I had a thought about the ice sculpture.

87
00:05:14,821 --> 00:05:16,364
A lot of people go with Cupid...

88
00:05:16,531 --> 00:05:19,242
but you gotta remember,
the bow and arrow melts first...

89
00:05:19,409 --> 00:05:22,370
and what you're left with
is a fat kid dancing in shrimp.

90
00:05:24,372 --> 00:05:25,665
There's gonna be shrimp?

91
00:05:26,374 --> 00:05:27,792
For the guests.

92
00:05:27,959 --> 00:05:31,504
- So what am I?
- Don't feed me straight lines, dear.

93
00:05:31,921 --> 00:05:33,548
Excuse me.

94
00:05:35,467 --> 00:05:38,595
Why would I feed her straight lines
if there's shrimp?

95
00:05:52,108 --> 00:05:56,279
- I'll be out in a minute.
- I can't wait. You'd better let me in now.

96
00:05:56,446 --> 00:05:58,281
Charlie, get out of here.

97
00:05:58,448 --> 00:06:01,242
Oh, come on.
You can't just cut me off like this.

98
00:06:01,409 --> 00:06:05,580
Hey, I can cut off whoever
or whatever I want.

99
00:06:06,081 --> 00:06:08,875
Are you playing hard-to-get
because you know it turns me on?

100
00:06:10,085 --> 00:06:11,836
I'm not playing, Charlie.

101
00:06:12,003 --> 00:06:15,382
Okay, I just have to say,
not playing turns me on more.

102
00:06:18,093 --> 00:06:20,303
Charlie, are you in there
with Courtney?

103
00:06:20,470 --> 00:06:22,097
No.

104
00:06:23,098 --> 00:06:25,058
- Hi, Courtney.
- Hey, Alan.

105
00:06:25,475 --> 00:06:27,227
- I thought we had an agreement.
- Yeah.

106
00:06:27,394 --> 00:06:30,230
The agreement was
Mom doesn't find out.

107
00:06:31,272 --> 00:06:34,109
Courtney? Are you okay, dear?

108
00:06:34,275 --> 00:06:36,444
Oh, I'm fine, Evelyn.

109
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:40,281
I thought you might be upset
about that prenup nonsense.

110
00:06:40,448 --> 00:06:43,660
And I just want you to know,
I'm not after your father's money.

111
00:06:43,827 --> 00:06:45,829
I'm sure you're not.

112
00:06:48,623 --> 00:06:50,750
Believe me,
I've got plenty of my own money.

113
00:06:50,917 --> 00:06:54,838
Of course, don't tell Alan and Charlie,
they're annoying enough as it is.

114
00:06:55,797 --> 00:06:57,423
I won't.

115
00:06:58,883 --> 00:07:00,510
So exactly how rich are you?

116
00:07:02,053 --> 00:07:03,138
I do all right.

117
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:08,309
When you marry my grandma,
what does that make you to me?

118
00:07:09,144 --> 00:07:10,812
Nothing.

119
00:07:13,022 --> 00:07:14,149
Sorry, dear.

120
00:07:14,315 --> 00:07:16,776
Oh, that's all right.
I was talking to the kid.

121
00:07:17,318 --> 00:07:20,363
- Isn't that nice?
- You know, even if we're not related...

122
00:07:20,530 --> 00:07:23,616
you could still buy me
birthday and Christmas presents.

123
00:07:23,992 --> 00:07:25,994
Thanks for the tip.

124
00:07:27,162 --> 00:07:28,621
I don't believe it.

125
00:07:28,788 --> 00:07:32,625
If Mom's got so much money, how come
we still get books for Christmas?

126
00:07:34,002 --> 00:07:35,253
Let it go, Alan.

127
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:39,215
Whatever money she has most likely
has got an ancient curse attached to it.

128
00:07:43,177 --> 00:07:45,805
- What are you doing?
- I'm here, I figured what the hell?

129
00:07:47,849 --> 00:07:50,727
- Remember to put the seat back down.
- It's a ladies' room.

130
00:07:50,894 --> 00:07:52,645
Why do they even go up?

131
00:07:52,812 --> 00:07:57,150
I don't know. It's a bigger target for
broads who want to puke their dinner.

132
00:07:58,067 --> 00:07:59,527
Makes sense.

133
00:07:59,694 --> 00:08:03,364
All right, let's talk about Courtney.

134
00:08:04,991 --> 00:08:08,453
- What do you want me to tell you?
- Why you're so obsessed with her.

135
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:11,706
Isn't it obvious?
She drinks, she smokes, she gambles.

136
00:08:11,873 --> 00:08:13,541
She's me with indoor plumbing.

137
00:08:18,755 --> 00:08:20,590
What are you doing in the ladies' room?

138
00:08:21,966 --> 00:08:23,343
The men's room was occupied.

139
00:08:23,927 --> 00:08:25,511
Do you have to pee sitting down?

140
00:08:25,929 --> 00:08:28,890
- No, the seats go up.
- Cool.

141
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:33,561
Hey, it smells nice in here.

142
00:08:40,943 --> 00:08:43,946
Hey, Courtney.
It's Charlie, your brother.

143
00:08:45,281 --> 00:08:49,452
Anyway, I just wanted to apologize for
making a scene there in the restaurant.

144
00:08:49,619 --> 00:08:51,913
I'd still love to get together,
so give me a call.

145
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:55,583
I'm just sitting at home,
reading a book.

146
00:08:57,627 --> 00:09:00,254
And watching TV.

147
00:09:02,590 --> 00:09:06,177
Disney Channel, 101 Dalmatians.

148
00:09:06,344 --> 00:09:08,471
What a great film, huh?

149
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:12,850
Sat on the remote.

150
00:09:13,017 --> 00:09:15,144
Hey, Apocalypse Now.

151
00:09:15,770 --> 00:09:17,814
Another great movie, huh?

152
00:09:18,398 --> 00:09:21,025
Anyway, call me.

153
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:30,618
- Hi, Charlie.
- Rose?

154
00:09:30,785 --> 00:09:33,246
What the hell are you doing here?

155
00:09:33,413 --> 00:09:35,123
I could ask you that question.

156
00:09:35,873 --> 00:09:38,835
And the answer would be the same:
Stalking.

157
00:09:40,711 --> 00:09:43,756
- No. No, I'm not...
- Good at it?

158
00:09:46,426 --> 00:09:49,345
- What do you want?
- Right now or long-term?

159
00:09:49,512 --> 00:09:50,638
Rose.

160
00:09:50,805 --> 00:09:56,060
I've just been watching you for an hour
and 38 minutes, and I felt bad for you.

161
00:09:56,227 --> 00:09:58,312
I thought maybe
you could use some help.

162
00:09:58,479 --> 00:09:59,605
Thanks, but I'm fine.

163
00:09:59,772 --> 00:10:02,191
Really? Did you bring water?

164
00:10:02,358 --> 00:10:03,901
No.

165
00:10:05,653 --> 00:10:07,321
Trail mix?

166
00:10:07,488 --> 00:10:08,948
No.

167
00:10:11,450 --> 00:10:13,244
Pee jar?

168
00:10:13,536 --> 00:10:17,206
- That would have been a great idea.
- Here you go.

169
00:10:18,666 --> 00:10:23,004
- Thank you.
- Let's see. What else?

170
00:10:23,171 --> 00:10:24,839
Night-vision goggles?

171
00:10:26,007 --> 00:10:28,009
- I don't think so.
- You say that now...

172
00:10:28,176 --> 00:10:31,470
but if you hide in her trunk
and wanna do a little light reading...

173
00:10:31,637 --> 00:10:32,805
you're gonna be sorry.

174
00:10:32,972 --> 00:10:35,683
- I'm fine.
- Okay.

175
00:10:35,850 --> 00:10:38,477
I'll just keep you company.
Give me one of these...

176
00:10:38,644 --> 00:10:40,396
if you need to use the pee jar.

177
00:10:41,689 --> 00:10:43,566
Charlie, what the hell are you doing?

178
00:10:44,775 --> 00:10:48,029
Hey. Teddy. How are you?

179
00:10:48,196 --> 00:10:49,989
Since when do you drive a Volvo?

180
00:10:50,531 --> 00:10:51,699
It's my brother's car.

181
00:10:51,866 --> 00:10:54,327
Very smart.
She would have spotted your car.

182
00:10:54,493 --> 00:10:56,162
I didn't give you points for that.

183
00:10:56,871 --> 00:10:58,831
I thought you and I
had an understanding...

184
00:10:58,998 --> 00:11:01,834
you and my daughter weren't
gonna see each other anymore.

185
00:11:02,001 --> 00:11:05,379
In my defense, we're not really
seeing each other. This is more of a...

186
00:11:05,546 --> 00:11:07,673
Reconnaissance mission.

187
00:11:08,090 --> 00:11:09,842
Who is this?

188
00:11:11,344 --> 00:11:13,220
This is Rose, she's kind of my...

189
00:11:13,387 --> 00:11:15,264
Sidekick.

190
00:11:16,515 --> 00:11:19,477
I don't wanna beat this to death,
but if your mother finds out...

191
00:11:19,644 --> 00:11:22,647
you and Courtney are seeing
each other, and I kept it from her...

192
00:11:22,813 --> 00:11:25,566
I don't know what she'd do.
Probably call off the wedding.

193
00:11:25,733 --> 00:11:27,985
I'm sorry, Teddy.
I don't want to screw things up.

194
00:11:28,152 --> 00:11:30,529
- Well, then, go home.
- Right.

195
00:11:31,072 --> 00:11:32,698
Nice to meet you, Rose.

196
00:11:38,579 --> 00:11:41,374
Boy, if he was 30 years younger,
I'd be following him.

197
00:11:43,751 --> 00:11:45,670
Oh, what the hell.

198
00:11:56,556 --> 00:11:59,226
You were with her, weren't you?

199
00:11:59,810 --> 00:12:01,812
What are you, my wife?

200
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:06,400
No, I'm the wedding planner.

201
00:12:08,652 --> 00:12:12,406
I'm the one who's dealing with caterers
and florists and musicians...

202
00:12:12,572 --> 00:12:15,659
and parking valets
and a thousand frozen butterflies.

203
00:12:16,326 --> 00:12:18,495
- Frozen butterflies?
- Mom wanted butterflies.

204
00:12:18,662 --> 00:12:20,080
What'll she do, eat them?

205
00:12:20,247 --> 00:12:22,249
No, you thaw them out
during the ceremony...

206
00:12:22,416 --> 00:12:24,835
and when the bride and groom kiss,
they fly away.

207
00:12:25,001 --> 00:12:27,879
- Is there still gonna be shrimp?
- Yes, there's gonna be shrimp.

208
00:12:28,046 --> 00:12:29,756
Good. I like shrimp.

209
00:12:32,342 --> 00:12:34,469
Charlie, I will not have you
ruin this wedding.

210
00:12:34,636 --> 00:12:37,973
Well, you can relax.
I wasn't with Courtney.

211
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:40,434
Thank God for that.
So where were you?

212
00:12:41,852 --> 00:12:44,312
Parked outside her apartment.

213
00:12:45,897 --> 00:12:47,190
You were stalking her?

214
00:12:48,024 --> 00:12:51,903
Oh, man,
why does everybody use that word?

215
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:56,450
- It has such a bad connotation.
- Charlie, what is wrong with you?

216
00:12:56,616 --> 00:13:00,620
- I've never seen you like this before.
- I know, I know.

217
00:13:01,204 --> 00:13:03,206
I can't get her out of my mind.

218
00:13:03,373 --> 00:13:06,251
I go to sleep thinking about her,
I wake up thinking about her.

219
00:13:06,418 --> 00:13:08,545
The other day,
I stumbled into a three-way...

220
00:13:12,924 --> 00:13:17,387
- How do you stumble into a three-way?
- It's usually a roommate thing.

221
00:13:18,221 --> 00:13:21,725
You read about sisters,
but that almost never happens.

222
00:13:22,267 --> 00:13:24,019
Anyway, in order to get through it...

223
00:13:24,186 --> 00:13:27,355
I had to fantasize
that both of them were Courtney.

224
00:13:27,522 --> 00:13:30,525
- How sad is that?
- I'm brokenhearted for you.

225
00:13:33,111 --> 00:13:34,279
You know what I think?

226
00:13:34,446 --> 00:13:38,325
I think the only reason you're obsessed
with Courtney is you can't have her.

227
00:13:38,491 --> 00:13:40,410
Well, duh.

228
00:13:40,911 --> 00:13:45,540
- Oh, please tell me you're not calling her.
- Of course not.

229
00:13:48,501 --> 00:13:51,546
Hey, Rose, it's Charlie.
Listen, after you're done with Teddy...

230
00:13:51,713 --> 00:13:54,633
can you swing by Courtney's
and let me know what she's doing?

231
00:14:01,765 --> 00:14:05,477
Okay, the vows. Now, I understand
you've written your own?

232
00:14:05,644 --> 00:14:06,978
First I'm hearing about it.

233
00:14:07,145 --> 00:14:11,608
Oh, forgive me, darling.
I took the liberty of writing both of ours.

234
00:14:13,777 --> 00:14:16,613
I come across kind of fruity, don't I?

235
00:14:17,239 --> 00:14:21,660
Well, you're in love with me.
Love makes everyone a little gay.

236
00:14:22,744 --> 00:14:23,995
Terrific.

237
00:14:25,038 --> 00:14:28,500
Please let that be my butterflies.
Please, please, please.

238
00:14:29,542 --> 00:14:32,295
That kid doesn't need butterflies.

239
00:14:34,130 --> 00:14:35,298
Hi, Courtney. Come on in.

240
00:14:35,465 --> 00:14:38,218
No, that's okay.
I just need to talk to my father.

241
00:14:38,385 --> 00:14:41,763
- What's up, baby?
- Is Courtney here?

242
00:14:44,307 --> 00:14:45,684
Hi, Courtney.

243
00:14:46,267 --> 00:14:49,688
Hi, Charlie. Dad, it's kind of private.
Can I talk to you outside, please?

244
00:14:49,854 --> 00:14:51,314
Sure. Excuse me.

245
00:14:52,065 --> 00:14:55,276
Did you happen to see
a frozen-butterfly truck go by?

246
00:14:56,820 --> 00:14:59,656
- Everything okay?
- No, no, everything is not okay.

247
00:14:59,823 --> 00:15:01,199
Always good to see you.

248
00:15:02,534 --> 00:15:06,079
- I don't understand why you won't help.
- Damn it, we've been through this.

249
00:15:06,246 --> 00:15:08,498
- I'm not gonna keep bailing you out.
- But, Daddy...

250
00:15:08,665 --> 00:15:09,958
Don't "But, Daddy" me.

251
00:15:10,125 --> 00:15:14,337
Sure makes you feel grateful
that the three of us get along so well.

252
00:15:14,838 --> 00:15:17,966
- Am I supposed to live on the street?
- Live within your means.

253
00:15:18,133 --> 00:15:20,510
You're just gonna turn your back?
Your own daughter?

254
00:15:20,677 --> 00:15:23,555
- Oh, don't be such a drama queen.
- Forget it, I'm out of here.

255
00:15:23,722 --> 00:15:25,682
Courtney, don't be like that.

256
00:15:30,478 --> 00:15:31,604
Okay, the butterflies.

257
00:15:32,689 --> 00:15:35,859
Now, Mom, when you kiss Teddy,
they're gonna be released on the deck.

258
00:15:36,025 --> 00:15:40,196
But there's a fifty-fifty chance that gulls
will swoop down and rip them to shreds.

259
00:15:45,702 --> 00:15:47,245
I'm sorry you heard that.

260
00:15:47,412 --> 00:15:50,999
- Do you want me to talk to her?
- No, no, leave it alone.

261
00:15:51,708 --> 00:15:53,501
I'll go talk to her.

262
00:15:57,046 --> 00:16:01,092
Would either of you care to explain
why he's going to talk to her?

263
00:16:02,093 --> 00:16:04,053
- No.
- No.

264
00:16:08,725 --> 00:16:11,060
- Hi.
- What are you doing here?

265
00:16:11,728 --> 00:16:15,231
I was concerned about you.
I thought maybe I could help.

266
00:16:15,690 --> 00:16:17,567
You can't help me.

267
00:16:18,443 --> 00:16:20,153
Try me.

268
00:16:22,822 --> 00:16:24,407
I was looking at the wrong window.

269
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:30,830
- What?
- Nice place.

270
00:16:33,875 --> 00:16:36,461
So, what's going on?

271
00:16:37,212 --> 00:16:39,255
What do you want me to tell you,
Charlie?

272
00:16:39,422 --> 00:16:42,217
I lost my job,
I'm about to lose my condo...

273
00:16:42,383 --> 00:16:45,428
and my father won't lift a finger
to help me.

274
00:16:47,514 --> 00:16:49,265
How much do you need?

275
00:16:49,432 --> 00:16:51,351
Forget it, I can't take your money.

276
00:16:52,852 --> 00:16:54,938
Well, I hadn't actually offered yet.

277
00:16:56,940 --> 00:17:01,444
But we are gonna be family,
and family looks after each other.

278
00:17:01,611 --> 00:17:03,154
I need $50,000.

279
00:17:07,825 --> 00:17:09,619
How about if I talk to your dad?

280
00:17:11,037 --> 00:17:12,705
It's no use.

281
00:17:12,872 --> 00:17:15,250
He's trying to teach me a lesson.

282
00:17:17,168 --> 00:17:20,046
You know, I just
love this place so much.

283
00:17:21,673 --> 00:17:23,633
I put every dime I had into it.

284
00:17:26,886 --> 00:17:28,638
Charlie, what am I gonna do?

285
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:33,268
You're gonna take
the money from me.

286
00:17:34,143 --> 00:17:35,561
No.

287
00:17:35,728 --> 00:17:37,355
No, it wouldn't be right.

288
00:17:37,522 --> 00:17:39,565
I insist.

289
00:17:42,485 --> 00:17:44,487
Really?

290
00:17:46,155 --> 00:17:47,490
I promise I'll pay you back.

291
00:17:48,157 --> 00:17:49,575
I know you will.

292
00:17:50,326 --> 00:17:52,120
Thank you.

293
00:17:52,286 --> 00:17:54,080
So much.

294
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:05,550
No, no, no, that's not why
I'm doing this.

295
00:18:05,717 --> 00:18:08,011
I know, I know, but I want you.

296
00:18:11,389 --> 00:18:12,557
I want you too...

297
00:18:12,724 --> 00:18:16,853
but I don't wanna feel like we're
doing this because I lent you money.

298
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:20,940
Okay, okay. But soon?

299
00:18:21,899 --> 00:18:23,359
Definitely soon.

300
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:34,370
- Good night.
- Night.

301
00:18:38,541 --> 00:18:41,836
Oh, hell, if you're okay with it,
I'm okay with it.

302
00:18:51,650 --> 00:18:54,737
"And I promise to honor
and cherish you...

303
00:18:54,904 --> 00:18:58,074
to always be there for you
as a trusted friend...

304
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:01,869
devoted husband and selfish lover."

305
00:19:02,787 --> 00:19:03,996
"Selfless."

306
00:19:04,705 --> 00:19:06,332
Oh, right, selfless.

307
00:19:08,667 --> 00:19:11,545
"And even though
I'm significantly older than you...

308
00:19:13,756 --> 00:19:16,258
I feel renewed and replenished...

309
00:19:16,425 --> 00:19:20,221
every time I drink
the sweet nectar of your youth."

310
00:19:20,971 --> 00:19:24,308
Pick it up, Teddy.
No one can see butterflies in the dark.

311
00:19:26,394 --> 00:19:29,230
"I remember the first time
I laid eyes on you...

312
00:19:29,730 --> 00:19:35,569
at one of the many charity events to
which you so tirelessly devote yourself.

313
00:19:36,112 --> 00:19:40,574
You were a vision in Dolce & Gabbana
and compassion.

314
00:19:41,617 --> 00:19:46,455
And that first moment we spoke,
the simple melody of your voice...

315
00:19:46,622 --> 00:19:50,209
was testimony
to how much the world lost...

316
00:19:50,376 --> 00:19:54,463
when you gave up
a very promising singing career...

317
00:19:55,297 --> 00:19:57,591
in order to raise your two little boys.

318
00:19:58,134 --> 00:20:00,970
Not that they ever appreciated it.

319
00:20:03,139 --> 00:20:05,307
And the lovemaking...

320
00:20:05,474 --> 00:20:08,269
what can I say
about the lovemaking?"

321
00:20:09,728 --> 00:20:13,566
- I can't say this.
- Lf you don't, I will.

322
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:23,826
"As I explored every inch of your firm,
non-surgically-enhanced body...

323
00:20:25,327 --> 00:20:29,790
I finally learned the meaning
of the words 'heaven on earth'...

324
00:20:31,166 --> 00:20:32,918
and 'natural redhead.'

325
00:20:39,508 --> 00:20:41,135
In the words of the Bard:

326
00:20:41,552 --> 00:20:45,347
Shall I compare thee
to the summer's day?

327
00:20:45,514 --> 00:20:48,434
Thou art more lovely
and more temperate.

328
00:20:48,601 --> 00:20:53,022
Rough winds do shake
The darling buds of May

329
00:20:53,188 --> 00:20:54,648
Will you marry me?

330
00:20:54,815 --> 00:20:57,151
And summer's lease
hath all to short a date.

331
00:20:57,318 --> 00:20:58,360
- Really?
- Yes.

332
00:20:58,527 --> 00:21:00,696
- So long as men can breathe
- Yes.

333
00:21:00,863 --> 00:21:02,698
- Our eyes can see
- Really?

334
00:21:02,865 --> 00:21:07,703
So long lives this,
and gives life to thee. "

335
00:21:08,537 --> 00:21:11,040
You may now kiss the bride.

336
00:21:23,469 --> 00:21:27,139
Do you want me to sweep them up
