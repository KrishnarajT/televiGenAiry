1
00:00:52,655 --> 00:00:55,866
It's hard to believe after all these years,
we've got a new stepdad.

2
00:00:56,826 --> 00:00:58,828
I give it six months.

3
00:00:58,995 --> 00:01:00,162
Come on, we like Teddy.

4
00:01:00,329 --> 00:01:03,332
That's why I'm only giving it six months.
I'm rooting for him.

5
00:01:04,375 --> 00:01:06,836
Still, you have to admit,
it was a beautiful ceremony.

6
00:01:07,003 --> 00:01:09,046
The bride and groom, the sun setting.

7
00:01:09,213 --> 00:01:10,506
The dead butterflies.

8
00:01:14,969 --> 00:01:17,847
Remind me to call the butterfly people
first thing Monday.

9
00:01:21,559 --> 00:01:23,352
What are you doing?

10
00:01:30,276 --> 00:01:31,360
Nothing.

11
00:01:31,777 --> 00:01:34,864
We don't eat from the cake
until we cut the cake.

12
00:01:35,031 --> 00:01:36,282
But I'm still hungry.

13
00:01:36,449 --> 00:01:37,700
Have some cheese.

14
00:01:37,867 --> 00:01:39,285
Have we cut the cheese?

15
00:01:41,037 --> 00:01:42,580
Get it?

16
00:01:43,748 --> 00:01:44,874
Hey, stepbrother.

17
00:01:45,041 --> 00:01:47,043
Change your mind
about wanting to marry me?

18
00:01:47,209 --> 00:01:48,377
Not at all.

19
00:01:48,544 --> 00:01:51,714
Wanna go upstairs and get a head start
on our honeymoon?

20
00:01:51,881 --> 00:01:53,424
You keep rubbing against me...

21
00:01:53,591 --> 00:01:56,635
I'll be able to catch my
mom's garter without my hands.

22
00:02:00,181 --> 00:02:02,224
- Charlie.
- What?

23
00:02:02,391 --> 00:02:03,601
At your mother's wedding?

24
00:02:04,352 --> 00:02:05,811
Yeah.

25
00:02:07,063 --> 00:02:09,231
I ain't cleaning it up.

26
00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:13,778
Boy, this is pretty kinky.

27
00:02:13,944 --> 00:02:15,071
Kinky good or kinky bad?

28
00:02:15,237 --> 00:02:17,323
There's a kinky bad?

29
00:02:18,199 --> 00:02:19,742
Watch your elbow.

30
00:02:19,909 --> 00:02:22,203
That's not my elbow.

31
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:23,579
Charlie.

32
00:02:24,246 --> 00:02:26,415
It's not that either.

33
00:02:29,126 --> 00:02:30,586
Daddy?

34
00:02:30,753 --> 00:02:31,921
This is awkward.

35
00:02:32,338 --> 00:02:34,423
Daddy, are you okay?

36
00:02:34,924 --> 00:02:37,927
- What's wrong with him?
- I don't know.

37
00:02:40,638 --> 00:02:42,098
Well?

38
00:02:42,264 --> 00:02:43,682
This might be a mood breaker.

39
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:03,078
So are you a friend of the bride
or the groom?

40
00:03:03,662 --> 00:03:05,872
Well, the bride is my mother, so...

41
00:03:06,039 --> 00:03:07,582
The groom.

42
00:03:07,999 --> 00:03:09,417
Hey, how do you like my house?

43
00:03:09,835 --> 00:03:11,336
Oh, it's beautiful.

44
00:03:12,712 --> 00:03:15,799
- Alan, I have to talk to you.
- Go away. I've got a shot here.

45
00:03:16,925 --> 00:03:18,260
No, you don't.

46
00:03:18,426 --> 00:03:20,095
- Come upstairs with me.
- Why?

47
00:03:20,262 --> 00:03:21,429
Just come on.

48
00:03:21,596 --> 00:03:23,431
Be right back.

49
00:03:23,765 --> 00:03:25,684
Friend of the bride
or friend of the groom?

50
00:03:26,017 --> 00:03:27,769
Friend of mine.

51
00:03:34,401 --> 00:03:37,112
Oh, my God.

52
00:03:37,279 --> 00:03:38,446
Is he...?

53
00:03:38,613 --> 00:03:40,699
As a doorknob.

54
00:03:41,658 --> 00:03:43,660
- Doorbell?
- Doornail.

55
00:03:44,786 --> 00:03:45,829
He's dead.

56
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:48,373
I can't believe he's gone.

57
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:50,208
Courtney, I'm so sorry.

58
00:03:51,835 --> 00:03:54,462
So he was just lying there
with his pants down?

59
00:03:55,505 --> 00:03:59,050
Apparently somebody was giving him
a very special wedding present.

60
00:03:59,926 --> 00:04:01,928
- Mom?
- I don't think so.

61
00:04:02,095 --> 00:04:04,347
She's downstairs
acting as if nothing happened.

62
00:04:04,514 --> 00:04:06,391
And more importantly,
she married the guy.

63
00:04:06,558 --> 00:04:08,101
Why would she bother?

64
00:04:09,978 --> 00:04:12,147
Your mother's looking for you guys.

65
00:04:15,191 --> 00:04:16,359
What's going on?

66
00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:18,903
Teddy's dead.

67
00:04:21,865 --> 00:04:24,075
Yeah, that's a stiffy.

68
00:04:25,493 --> 00:04:27,662
We have got a real problem here.

69
00:04:27,829 --> 00:04:29,372
What do you mean "we"?

70
00:05:00,904 --> 00:05:03,448
Oh, this is just gonna suck.

71
00:05:11,581 --> 00:05:15,335
Thank you, thank you. Now, this
next song you may remember...

72
00:05:15,502 --> 00:05:18,046
from the hit movie Ghost.

73
00:05:24,803 --> 00:05:26,012
Mom?

74
00:05:27,889 --> 00:05:29,140
Mom, we gotta talk to you.

75
00:05:30,266 --> 00:05:31,351
What?

76
00:05:33,978 --> 00:05:35,105
It's about Teddy.

77
00:05:35,563 --> 00:05:38,233
Where is he?
This is supposed to be a duet.

78
00:05:43,154 --> 00:05:47,492
Yeah, well, from now on, I'm afraid
you're gonna be working alone.

79
00:05:47,659 --> 00:05:51,329
You son of a bitch.

80
00:05:52,122 --> 00:05:54,916
So you weren't the one who was...?

81
00:05:55,083 --> 00:05:58,753
Of course not.
I already married the man.

82
00:06:02,257 --> 00:06:06,761
I just can't believe he'd cheat on me
on our wedding day.

83
00:06:06,928 --> 00:06:10,181
Excuse me,
my father is lying here dead.

84
00:06:10,348 --> 00:06:13,852
With his pants around his ankles
and lipstick on his hoo-hoo.

85
00:06:15,186 --> 00:06:18,356
Oh, my, what happened in here?

86
00:06:19,941 --> 00:06:22,944
Berta, my husband is dead.

87
00:06:23,570 --> 00:06:25,822
As a doornail.

88
00:06:28,283 --> 00:06:29,993
Has anybody called the cops?

89
00:06:31,327 --> 00:06:32,704
You might wanna consider it...

90
00:06:32,871 --> 00:06:36,666
because you only got a limited window
before he starts stinking up the joint.

91
00:06:37,709 --> 00:06:38,877
I'll make the calls.

92
00:06:39,043 --> 00:06:41,212
- No, Mom, you don't have to.
- Yes, I do.

93
00:06:41,379 --> 00:06:43,381
I'm his wife.

94
00:06:43,715 --> 00:06:47,802
Now, please, would you all just
give me a moment alone with him?

95
00:06:47,969 --> 00:06:49,888
- Of course.
- Sure, Mom.

96
00:06:50,305 --> 00:06:53,933
So who do you suppose
was smoking Teddy's sausage?

97
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:56,561
Berta, that is my father in there.

98
00:06:56,728 --> 00:06:57,812
Okay.

99
00:06:57,979 --> 00:07:01,149
So who do you suppose
was smoking your father's sausage?

100
00:07:02,275 --> 00:07:03,860
Oh, Teddy.

101
00:07:04,277 --> 00:07:07,405
My dear, dear Teddy.

102
00:07:14,412 --> 00:07:16,080
Hello.

103
00:07:16,414 --> 00:07:19,250
This is Evelyn Harper Leopold.

104
00:07:20,251 --> 00:07:23,046
I booked my honeymoon with you.

105
00:07:23,713 --> 00:07:25,298
Yes.

106
00:07:25,465 --> 00:07:28,468
Two business-class tickets to Paris.

107
00:07:30,178 --> 00:07:34,766
I need to exchange them
for one first-class ticket to Fiji.

108
00:07:36,476 --> 00:07:38,436
Sure, I'll hold.

109
00:07:39,771 --> 00:07:42,982
This is a crime scene,
so you're just gonna have to be patient.

110
00:07:43,149 --> 00:07:46,444
We'll need statements from
each of you before you can leave.

111
00:07:48,112 --> 00:07:52,033
Anyway, I guess what I'm saying is that
there's a lesson to be learned here.

112
00:07:52,492 --> 00:07:55,536
Life is precious and no one really knows
how long we've got.

113
00:07:57,038 --> 00:07:59,916
So it's important to be grateful
for each day.

114
00:08:01,501 --> 00:08:04,379
So if they're not gonna cut the cake,
can I have some now?

115
00:08:04,545 --> 00:08:06,297
Aren't you full?

116
00:08:14,514 --> 00:08:15,973
No.

117
00:08:17,684 --> 00:08:18,935
Take a look at his pants.

118
00:08:22,563 --> 00:08:24,816
The belt is buckled on an unworn hole.

119
00:08:24,982 --> 00:08:26,275
Someone re-dressed him.

120
00:08:27,151 --> 00:08:28,444
Any of you touch the body?

121
00:08:31,322 --> 00:08:33,074
Interesting.

122
00:08:33,449 --> 00:08:37,120
We've got some peri-mortem
ecchymosis on the posterior occiput.

123
00:08:38,287 --> 00:08:41,374
That means a bruise
on the back of the head.

124
00:08:41,541 --> 00:08:44,627
And yet you still couldn't get
into medical school.

125
00:08:46,129 --> 00:08:47,839
So much for time of death.

126
00:08:48,005 --> 00:08:51,259
Looks like our boy here had some
sexual activity before he bought it.

127
00:08:51,801 --> 00:08:54,595
Hit the light.
I'm gonna check for semen.

128
00:09:01,602 --> 00:09:03,855
My God.

129
00:09:04,021 --> 00:09:06,774
It's like a Jackson Pollock painting.

130
00:09:10,236 --> 00:09:13,906
The ceiling fan's actually a cute story.

131
00:09:16,612 --> 00:09:18,864
- Coffee?
- Thanks.

132
00:09:19,031 --> 00:09:21,700
- So Mr. Harper...
- Call me Charlie.

133
00:09:22,326 --> 00:09:25,079
- And you are?
- Interested in how you found the body.

134
00:09:25,245 --> 00:09:28,165
Oh, right to it, huh?

135
00:09:28,707 --> 00:09:33,087
Okay, well, what have you heard?

136
00:09:34,713 --> 00:09:36,298
That's not how we do this.

137
00:09:36,465 --> 00:09:38,717
You tell me what happened.

138
00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:40,886
All right.

139
00:09:41,053 --> 00:09:44,390
I went upstairs to use the bathroom
and there he was.

140
00:09:49,770 --> 00:09:52,064
Oh, no.

141
00:09:52,689 --> 00:09:54,525
Teddy.

142
00:09:56,276 --> 00:09:58,612
So you're saying you were alone
when you found him?

143
00:09:58,779 --> 00:10:01,573
Well, technically aren't we all alone?

144
00:10:04,034 --> 00:10:06,787
You know, I'm finding that tank top
awfully distracting.

145
00:10:14,211 --> 00:10:15,754
Is that police issue?

146
00:10:21,718 --> 00:10:23,011
Mr. Harper, are you aware...

147
00:10:23,178 --> 00:10:26,807
that making a false statement
to the police is a crime?

148
00:10:27,766 --> 00:10:28,976
Slap-on-the-wrist crime...

149
00:10:29,143 --> 00:10:32,146
or pack-my-bags-and-tape-my-butt-shut
crime?

150
00:10:35,107 --> 00:10:38,652
Hey, I like it when it's gift-wrapped.

151
00:10:42,072 --> 00:10:45,367
Okay, okay, I wasn't alone.
I was with Courtney.

152
00:10:45,784 --> 00:10:47,119
- Why'd you lie?
- Oh, come on.

153
00:10:47,286 --> 00:10:50,539
I was trying to nail my stepsister
at my mother's wedding.

154
00:10:51,248 --> 00:10:54,001
Lying seemed the classy way to go.

155
00:10:55,586 --> 00:10:56,712
Did you touch the body?

156
00:10:56,879 --> 00:10:58,964
I was all over her body.

157
00:11:01,758 --> 00:11:03,343
Oh, you mean Teddy?

158
00:11:03,510 --> 00:11:06,013
No, no, no.
Not after I knew he was there.

159
00:11:06,179 --> 00:11:08,307
Who do you suppose
pulled up his pants?

160
00:11:09,808 --> 00:11:12,895
Are you thinking whoever pulled
them up is the one who killed him?

161
00:11:13,061 --> 00:11:14,354
It's crossed our minds.

162
00:11:14,521 --> 00:11:17,649
Oh, gee,
I don't wanna implicate anybody.

163
00:11:17,816 --> 00:11:19,818
Right now,
the only one implicated is you.

164
00:11:19,985 --> 00:11:21,987
Talk to my mother.

165
00:11:23,655 --> 00:11:25,157
What is that? Nondairy creamer?

166
00:11:25,324 --> 00:11:28,493
Just take me to the green mile
and be done with it.

167
00:11:29,745 --> 00:11:30,829
That's all we've got.

168
00:11:30,996 --> 00:11:35,042
Please, this place is crawling with cops.
One of them can't make a Starbucks run?

169
00:11:36,835 --> 00:11:39,671
- Mrs. Harper...
- Mrs. Leopold.

170
00:11:39,838 --> 00:11:41,465
Mrs. Leopold.

171
00:11:41,632 --> 00:11:45,260
Did you touch your husband's body
before the police arrived?

172
00:11:45,427 --> 00:11:47,262
All right, yes, I pulled up his pants.

173
00:11:47,429 --> 00:11:50,223
- Why?
- Because it was embarrassing.

174
00:11:50,390 --> 00:11:53,393
There was lipstick on his hoo-hoo.

175
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:55,020
- Your lipstick?
- Oh, God, no.

176
00:11:55,187 --> 00:11:57,356
I'd rather drink your coffee.

177
00:11:59,858 --> 00:12:01,234
So he was with another woman?

178
00:12:01,693 --> 00:12:03,278
Not necessarily.

179
00:12:03,445 --> 00:12:06,865
Do you have another theory
for where the lipstick came from?

180
00:12:07,407 --> 00:12:09,409
Have you ruled out clowns?

181
00:12:15,624 --> 00:12:18,794
You should check
for really big footprints.

182
00:12:22,381 --> 00:12:24,758
Okay, he was with another woman.

183
00:12:25,467 --> 00:12:29,221
- I imagine that made you pretty angry.
- I don't get angry. I get even.

184
00:12:32,599 --> 00:12:34,393
I mean, what are you insinuating?

185
00:12:34,559 --> 00:12:37,562
I'm insinuating that maybe
you caught him in the act.

186
00:12:43,318 --> 00:12:46,822
- Evie.
- You cheating bastard.

187
00:12:46,988 --> 00:12:48,657
Evie, I can explain.

188
00:12:50,951 --> 00:12:53,036
Evie, I can explain.

189
00:12:53,203 --> 00:12:54,913
I can explain.

190
00:13:04,381 --> 00:13:07,259
And Paris for two becomes Fiji for one.

191
00:13:08,343 --> 00:13:09,928
We checked your phone records.

192
00:13:10,595 --> 00:13:12,431
Listen, let me tell you something.

193
00:13:12,597 --> 00:13:14,266
I loved that man and he loved me.

194
00:13:14,433 --> 00:13:17,310
In fact, he loved me so much,
he didn't even ask for a prenup.

195
00:13:17,477 --> 00:13:20,147
And believe me, he's got money.
Big money.

196
00:13:21,773 --> 00:13:25,819
Well, we don't have to look very hard
to find a motive for you, do we?

197
00:13:32,492 --> 00:13:35,954
I'm warning you,
coffee tends to shoot through me.

198
00:13:36,288 --> 00:13:40,208
So if you've got a cavity search
planned, you better do it pretty quick.

199
00:13:42,711 --> 00:13:44,629
We don't need to do a cavity search.

200
00:13:44,796 --> 00:13:46,882
Can I request one?

201
00:13:49,968 --> 00:13:51,803
What do you know
about Teddy Leopold?

202
00:13:52,304 --> 00:13:54,639
I know he was hot for me.

203
00:13:54,973 --> 00:13:56,600
He was always flirting.

204
00:13:56,766 --> 00:13:59,811
Berta, this is mom's boyfriend, Teddy.
Teddy, my housekeeper Berta.

205
00:14:00,312 --> 00:14:03,815
- A pleasure.
- It could be if you play your cards right.

206
00:14:11,364 --> 00:14:12,782
You can't blame him.

207
00:14:12,949 --> 00:14:16,828
You gotta figure that boinking Evelyn
is like riding a bicycle over train tracks.

208
00:14:18,538 --> 00:14:22,751
You'll get where you're going,
but you're gonna feel every bump.

209
00:14:26,671 --> 00:14:29,507
- How's the hot chocolate?
- Good. I like the powdered stuff...

210
00:14:29,674 --> 00:14:33,345
because there's always something
to chew on when you get to the bottom.

211
00:14:39,768 --> 00:14:41,186
- You got any donuts?
- Nope.

212
00:14:41,353 --> 00:14:42,437
- Danish?
- Nope.

213
00:14:42,604 --> 00:14:43,730
Pie?

214
00:14:44,731 --> 00:14:46,942
Look, Jake, what I wanna know is...

215
00:14:47,108 --> 00:14:49,444
were you in your uncle's room
at any time today?

216
00:14:49,611 --> 00:14:51,863
- No, I never go in my uncle's room.
- Why not?

217
00:14:52,364 --> 00:14:55,033
Because all the skin mags
are in my dad's room.

218
00:14:57,535 --> 00:15:01,289
Okay, let me just start out by saying
I know about the illegal left-turn ticket.

219
00:15:01,456 --> 00:15:03,625
And I've been meaning
to take care of it...

220
00:15:03,792 --> 00:15:07,087
but, you know, business has been
slow, and bills just keep coming.

221
00:15:07,253 --> 00:15:09,255
Of course I don't have to tell you that.

222
00:15:09,422 --> 00:15:11,424
Our law enforcement personnel
are underpaid.

223
00:15:11,591 --> 00:15:13,510
Thank you for the coffee, by the way.

224
00:15:14,803 --> 00:15:18,390
Cops and truck drivers, you know
your coffee. Am I going to jail?

225
00:15:21,267 --> 00:15:23,228
Tell me about you
and Teddy Leopold.

226
00:15:23,395 --> 00:15:25,563
Oh, I loved Teddy.
He was like a father to me.

227
00:15:25,730 --> 00:15:27,107
- Is that so?
- Yeah, yeah.

228
00:15:27,273 --> 00:15:30,235
He took me to Vegas,
brought me a hooker.

229
00:15:31,069 --> 00:15:33,071
Would any of you gentlemen
like a date?

230
00:15:33,238 --> 00:15:34,739
Sorry, doll, I'm taken.

231
00:15:34,906 --> 00:15:37,909
But I wouldn't mind
footing the bill for my two boys here.

232
00:15:38,326 --> 00:15:39,828
Hi, I'm Amber.

233
00:15:39,994 --> 00:15:41,079
I'm Tiffany.

234
00:15:44,082 --> 00:15:45,959
- Thanks, Daddy.
- Thanks, Daddy.

235
00:15:47,585 --> 00:15:48,628
A hooker?

236
00:15:49,421 --> 00:15:50,588
And gelato.

237
00:15:51,047 --> 00:15:54,134
- You got my blessing, Teddy.
- Shut up and eat your gelato.

238
00:15:54,968 --> 00:15:57,053
So you were happy
he married your mother?

239
00:15:57,262 --> 00:15:58,721
Are you kidding? I was thrilled.

240
00:15:58,888 --> 00:16:01,516
I planned the wedding.
And it went great.

241
00:16:01,683 --> 00:16:04,060
The reception not so much.

242
00:16:04,477 --> 00:16:06,438
Why, what happened?

243
00:16:07,147 --> 00:16:08,940
The groom died.

244
00:16:10,942 --> 00:16:12,652
Remember?

245
00:16:16,114 --> 00:16:18,199
Do you need to write that down?

246
00:16:19,742 --> 00:16:21,619
Any idea
who might have wanted him dead?

247
00:16:21,786 --> 00:16:23,872
No, no, everybody loved Teddy.

248
00:16:24,038 --> 00:16:25,540
And he was so good to my mom.

249
00:16:25,707 --> 00:16:27,792
It's a shame
she has to bury another husband.

250
00:16:28,376 --> 00:16:29,461
Another husband?

251
00:16:30,503 --> 00:16:33,465
Yeah, well, she's, you know,
had a bit of bad luck...

252
00:16:33,631 --> 00:16:35,633
in the dead spouse department.

253
00:16:37,594 --> 00:16:40,597
Not that you can have good luck
in the dead spouse department.

254
00:16:40,763 --> 00:16:42,724
Can I have some more coffee?

255
00:16:43,725 --> 00:16:45,310
Who ratted me out? Was it Alan?

256
00:16:45,477 --> 00:16:46,519
Oh, it doesn't matter.

257
00:16:46,686 --> 00:16:50,315
Either one of them would throw me
under a bus for an Eskimo Pie.

258
00:16:51,274 --> 00:16:53,651
We'd just like to know
about your late husbands.

259
00:16:54,444 --> 00:16:57,155
All right. There's not much to tell.

260
00:16:57,322 --> 00:16:59,824
Charlie and Alan's father
died of food poisoning.

261
00:16:59,991 --> 00:17:01,242
Where'd he get the food?

262
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,746
I was a young bride.
I was just learning to cook.

263
00:17:04,913 --> 00:17:08,541
And nobody told me
you don't keep fish in a drawer.

264
00:17:09,792 --> 00:17:11,836
All right, what about the others?

265
00:17:12,253 --> 00:17:14,464
Oh, the usual.

266
00:17:14,631 --> 00:17:18,176
Couple of heart attacks,
a bathtub electrocution.

267
00:17:20,261 --> 00:17:21,763
Why are you grilling me?

268
00:17:21,930 --> 00:17:24,849
I'm not the one who was
fighting with him over money.

269
00:17:25,016 --> 00:17:26,351
Who was?

270
00:17:26,517 --> 00:17:28,269
I don't understand
why you won't help.

271
00:17:28,436 --> 00:17:31,356
We've been through this.
I'm not gonna keep bailing you out.

272
00:17:31,522 --> 00:17:33,608
- But, Daddy, l...
- Don't "But Daddy" me.

273
00:17:33,775 --> 00:17:35,401
What am I to do?
Live on the street?

274
00:17:35,568 --> 00:17:37,528
You're supposed to live
within your means.

275
00:17:38,446 --> 00:17:40,365
I want a lawyer.

276
00:17:44,369 --> 00:17:46,245
Tall soy latte, no foam.

277
00:17:46,412 --> 00:17:48,873
Grandmommy
can't drink this cop swill anymore.

278
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:52,418
- Mom, they told us to wait here.
- Well, that's why I'm sending Jake.

279
00:17:52,585 --> 00:17:54,712
Think of it as job training, dear.

280
00:17:55,463 --> 00:17:57,131
Hi, Charlie.

281
00:17:57,298 --> 00:17:58,549
Hey, Charlie.

282
00:17:58,716 --> 00:18:00,551
Hi, Charlie.

283
00:18:00,718 --> 00:18:02,679
Hi, Alan.

284
00:18:05,556 --> 00:18:07,308
I'm not the one
who's got a husband...

285
00:18:07,475 --> 00:18:10,395
with someone else's lipstick
on his dipstick.

286
00:18:11,396 --> 00:18:12,605
Has anybody seen Courtney?

287
00:18:12,772 --> 00:18:14,399
She's talking to her attorney.

288
00:18:14,565 --> 00:18:15,942
Why does she need an attorney?

289
00:18:16,109 --> 00:18:19,946
GC mass spec analysis revealed
that the lipstick pigment on the body...

290
00:18:20,113 --> 00:18:22,532
matches lipstick she was wearing.
- Wait.

291
00:18:22,699 --> 00:18:25,451
- Courtney with her own father?
- Not according to their DNA.

292
00:18:25,618 --> 00:18:27,453
- They're not even related.
- What?

293
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:29,872
- You're kidding.
- They're con artists, grifters.

294
00:18:30,039 --> 00:18:31,624
Wanted in half a dozen states.

295
00:18:31,791 --> 00:18:35,920
His real name is Nathan Krunk
and she is Sylvia Fishman.

296
00:18:37,088 --> 00:18:38,715
That can't be right.

297
00:18:38,881 --> 00:18:40,258
I was gonna marry her.

298
00:18:40,425 --> 00:18:42,093
- What?
- What?

299
00:18:43,678 --> 00:18:46,931
We were gonna surprise you,
but I guess that ship has sailed.

300
00:18:48,015 --> 00:18:49,767
They've got a record of marital fraud.

301
00:18:49,934 --> 00:18:52,228
They pick out marks
with more money than brains...

302
00:18:52,395 --> 00:18:54,814
and then take them down the aisle.

303
00:18:54,981 --> 00:18:57,108
You're just gonna
turn your back on me?

304
00:18:57,275 --> 00:18:59,819
- Don't be such a drama queen.
- You know what, forget it.

305
00:18:59,986 --> 00:19:02,196
- I'm out of here.
- Courtney, don't be like that.

306
00:19:02,947 --> 00:19:05,199
But I don't understand.

307
00:19:05,366 --> 00:19:08,327
Teddy didn't need money.
He was a very wealthy man.

308
00:19:08,494 --> 00:19:12,331
And I practically had to force Courtney
to take my $50,000.

309
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:22,258
But what about his lifestyle?

310
00:19:22,425 --> 00:19:24,510
The private jet, the trips to Vegas?

311
00:19:24,677 --> 00:19:26,345
Bad checks, stolen credit cards.

312
00:19:26,512 --> 00:19:29,515
The reason he didn't want a prenup
is so he could get your money.

313
00:19:29,724 --> 00:19:32,810
But then why would Courtney
kill her own partner?

314
00:19:32,977 --> 00:19:34,353
She didn't.

315
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:38,941
They were going at it hot and heavy
and his heart gave out.

316
00:19:42,987 --> 00:19:45,406
Yeah, I can see that happening.

317
00:19:46,824 --> 00:19:49,952
What threw us off at first was
the bruising on the back of his head.

318
00:19:50,119 --> 00:19:52,830
Then autopsy revealed
that had happened roughly 48 hours...

319
00:19:52,997 --> 00:19:54,457
before time of death.

320
00:19:54,624 --> 00:19:56,834
Still up to get together,
so give me a call.

321
00:19:57,001 --> 00:19:59,962
I'm just sitting at home,
reading a book.

322
00:20:00,796 --> 00:20:02,048
That hurts.

323
00:20:02,215 --> 00:20:03,257
Wanna switch?

324
00:20:03,424 --> 00:20:06,385
Yeah, let's try banging
your head for a while.

325
00:20:08,179 --> 00:20:09,430
I don't believe it.

326
00:20:09,597 --> 00:20:13,059
She used me, she scammed me,
she took my money.

327
00:20:15,269 --> 00:20:17,355
- Courtney.
- What?

328
00:20:18,022 --> 00:20:19,523
I'll wait for you.

329
00:20:27,550 --> 00:20:30,470
Got a postcard from the black widow.

330
00:20:31,471 --> 00:20:32,805
No kidding.

331
00:20:32,972 --> 00:20:35,475
- How's her honeymoon going?
- Pretty good apparently.

332
00:20:35,641 --> 00:20:38,394
She's already met
a wealthy real-estate investor.

333
00:20:38,561 --> 00:20:41,272
I gotta admit, the woman's got spirit.

334
00:20:41,439 --> 00:20:45,568
No matter what life throws at her,
she always lands on her back.

335
00:20:49,906 --> 00:20:51,491
What's the matter?

336
00:21:01,501 --> 00:21:04,253
- Oh, Jake.
- Oh, God.

337
00:21:05,588 --> 00:21:08,007
That was a good one, wasn't it?
