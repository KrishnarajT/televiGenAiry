1
00:00:06,713 --> 00:00:09,967
- Wake up, wake up, wake up.
- I'm sorry, Mom. I love you.

2
00:00:11,009 --> 00:00:12,636
- What?
- What?

3
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:15,180
There's something you gotta see.

4
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:19,268
It has to be better than my dream.

5
00:00:21,103 --> 00:00:24,231
- Wake up, wake up, wake up.
- It's Dad's magazine.

6
00:00:25,023 --> 00:00:26,525
- What?
- What?

7
00:00:27,025 --> 00:00:29,027
There's something you gotta see.

8
00:00:29,861 --> 00:00:32,990
I was already seeing everything
I needed to see.

9
00:00:34,825 --> 00:00:35,867
What's going on?

10
00:00:36,034 --> 00:00:38,495
Remember how I recorded
those kids' songs months ago?

11
00:00:38,662 --> 00:00:40,205
Yeah, they sucked.

12
00:00:40,914 --> 00:00:43,333
Of course they sucked,
they're kids' songs.

13
00:00:44,167 --> 00:00:46,962
The CD's coming out,
and the first commercial's about to air.

14
00:00:47,129 --> 00:00:48,213
At 5 in the morning?

15
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:50,299
That's when moms
with little kids are up.

16
00:00:50,465 --> 00:00:52,634
Oh, Becker's over. I'm up next.

17
00:00:53,051 --> 00:00:54,261
Who loves kids?

18
00:00:54,428 --> 00:00:56,847
Charlie Waffles.

19
00:00:58,181 --> 00:00:59,558
Who cut the cheese?

20
00:00:59,933 --> 00:01:01,393
Who cut the cheese?

21
00:01:01,727 --> 00:01:04,896
I ask you please
Did you cut the cheese?

22
00:01:05,355 --> 00:01:07,733
That's right. Charlie Waffles.

23
00:01:07,899 --> 00:01:11,028
And now,
you can get his greatest hits on one CD.

24
00:01:11,653 --> 00:01:13,739
- Charlie Waffles?
- My idea.

25
00:01:14,156 --> 00:01:17,200
- Kids love waffles.
- That's true.

26
00:01:17,617 --> 00:01:20,579
Yes, you'll get all the melodies
that made Charlie Waffles...

27
00:01:20,746 --> 00:01:22,205
the king of kids ' songs.

28
00:01:22,372 --> 00:01:27,753
"Kiss My Owie,"Rush to Flush,"
and of course, "Don 't Shake the Baby."

29
00:01:27,919 --> 00:01:30,756
He's a little boy
He is not a toy

30
00:01:30,922 --> 00:01:34,426
Don 't shake, shake, shake the baby

31
00:01:34,885 --> 00:01:38,013
She's our little pearl
Our darling girl

32
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:41,767
Don 't shake, shake, shake the baby

33
00:01:43,268 --> 00:01:45,353
When did you become
the king of kids' songs?

34
00:01:45,771 --> 00:01:48,106
When did you become
the Federal Trade Commission?

35
00:01:48,899 --> 00:01:52,402
Grandma may smell funny
But hug her anyway

36
00:01:52,569 --> 00:01:56,031
Accept her stinky kisses
And then go out and play

37
00:01:56,531 --> 00:02:00,118
But she's got all the money
So you might just want to stay

38
00:02:00,285 --> 00:02:02,287
Oh, Grandma may smell funny...

39
00:02:02,454 --> 00:02:03,955
But wait, there's more.

40
00:02:04,122 --> 00:02:05,707
With this special TV offer...

41
00:02:05,874 --> 00:02:09,878
you'll also receive
this never-before-released bonus track.

42
00:02:10,045 --> 00:02:13,548
I drink from a sippy cup
Sippy cup, sippy cup

43
00:02:13,715 --> 00:02:17,260
I drink from a sippy cup
'Cause I'm a big kid now

44
00:02:17,761 --> 00:02:19,429
Bye-bye, boobies

45
00:02:19,596 --> 00:02:20,889
Bye-bye, boobies

46
00:02:21,306 --> 00:02:24,643
Bye-bye, boobies
'Cause I'm a big kid now

47
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:29,940
Call now and you'll also receive a bonus
Charlie Waffles scratch-and-sniff poster.

48
00:02:30,106 --> 00:02:32,651
It smells just like maple syrup.

49
00:02:32,817 --> 00:02:35,153
What, they couldn't make it
smell like bourbon?

50
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:39,449
Operators are standing by.
Give your child the gift of music.

51
00:02:39,616 --> 00:02:42,577
- Who loves kids?
- Charlie Waffles.

52
00:02:42,744 --> 00:02:44,412
Right.

53
00:02:46,248 --> 00:02:48,083
That's it. What do you think?

54
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:52,712
I'm going back to bed.

55
00:02:53,672 --> 00:02:57,467
- What about you?
- You couldn't have TiVo'd this?

56
00:02:57,926 --> 00:03:02,222
Hey, Charlie Waffles may love kids,
but he's getting pretty sick of you.

57
00:03:04,182 --> 00:03:06,434
Oh, boy, Dharma and Greg.

58
00:03:37,683 --> 00:03:40,686
I still don't understand why
you wanted to come shopping with me.

59
00:03:40,853 --> 00:03:44,523
- I told you. I gotta pick up something.
- You could have just put it on the list.

60
00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:47,526
Hey, maybe I just wanna
hang out with my brother.

61
00:03:47,693 --> 00:03:51,572
- Really? Oh, well, that's a very nice...
- Get away, get away, get away.

62
00:03:54,033 --> 00:03:55,909
Of course.

63
00:04:04,752 --> 00:04:05,836
Excuse me.

64
00:04:06,003 --> 00:04:08,088
Do you know
where the chewable vitamins are?

65
00:04:08,672 --> 00:04:10,883
Oh, I think they're...

66
00:04:11,675 --> 00:04:13,260
Oh, my God, you're him.

67
00:04:13,761 --> 00:04:15,929
- I'm sorry?
- You're Charlie Waffles, right?

68
00:04:17,014 --> 00:04:19,892
- You caught me.
- My daughter just loves your songs.

69
00:04:20,059 --> 00:04:23,896
Oh, gee, you don't know
how that fills my heart.

70
00:04:24,313 --> 00:04:27,191
There's about to be
a vomit spill on Aisle 3.

71
00:04:27,733 --> 00:04:29,693
- How old is your little girl?
- Five.

72
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:32,821
No way. What, did you have her
when you were 12?

73
00:04:32,988 --> 00:04:34,823
- Oh, you're sweet.
- I know.

74
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:38,118
Hey, she's not gonna believe I met you.
Can I take a picture of you?

75
00:04:38,285 --> 00:04:40,746
- Better still, let's take one together.
- Oh, okay.

76
00:04:40,913 --> 00:04:42,915
Excuse me, sir.
Would you take our picture?

77
00:04:45,959 --> 00:04:47,252
Sir?

78
00:04:48,045 --> 00:04:50,172
Oh, yeah, yeah. Sure.

79
00:04:52,883 --> 00:04:54,426
Say "waffles."

80
00:04:54,593 --> 00:04:56,095
- Waffles.
- Waffles.

81
00:04:58,055 --> 00:05:00,140
- Thanks, pal.
- Thank you.

82
00:05:00,307 --> 00:05:01,767
Don't let your husband see that.

83
00:05:01,934 --> 00:05:04,269
He might get the wrong idea
about Charlie Waffles.

84
00:05:04,436 --> 00:05:07,272
- Oh, there is no husband.
- No kidding?

85
00:05:07,439 --> 00:05:09,983
Oh, my God.

86
00:05:10,943 --> 00:05:14,071
Jodie is gonna love this.
I'm gonna save it for her birthday.

87
00:05:14,238 --> 00:05:15,447
Her birthday's coming up?

88
00:05:15,614 --> 00:05:18,784
- This weekend, she'll be 6.
- Oh, what a magical age.

89
00:05:19,368 --> 00:05:24,206
Tell you what. How would Jodie like
a free Charlie Waffles birthday concert?

90
00:05:24,915 --> 00:05:25,958
You would do that?

91
00:05:26,708 --> 00:05:27,793
Who loves kids?

92
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:29,962
Charlie Waffles.

93
00:05:30,838 --> 00:05:33,674
Right. Call me.

94
00:05:35,968 --> 00:05:39,263
Look, it's got a little waffle on it.
How adorable.

95
00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:44,143
I told you I had to pick something up.

96
00:05:46,854 --> 00:05:50,232
Grandma may smell funny
But hug her anyway

97
00:05:50,607 --> 00:05:54,194
Accept her stinky kisses
And then go out and play

98
00:05:54,486 --> 00:05:58,031
But she's got all the money
So you might just want to stay

99
00:05:58,198 --> 00:06:02,202
Oh, Grandma may smell funny
But hug her anyway

100
00:06:02,578 --> 00:06:05,789
Hug her anyway
So hug her anyway

101
00:06:05,956 --> 00:06:08,041
Sing
Hug her anyway

102
00:06:09,251 --> 00:06:10,335
Pretty catchy, huh?

103
00:06:10,961 --> 00:06:13,046
So is gonorrhea.

104
00:06:13,964 --> 00:06:16,049
Drinking from the well of bitterness,
are we?

105
00:06:16,508 --> 00:06:19,052
I just don't understand
what kind of spiteful god...

106
00:06:19,219 --> 00:06:21,680
could allow my drunken
whoremonger of a brother...

107
00:06:21,847 --> 00:06:23,724
to become a children's singing star...

108
00:06:23,891 --> 00:06:26,685
while I toil away
in poverty-stricken anonymity.

109
00:06:27,102 --> 00:06:30,689
You wanna talk to me about toiling away
in poverty-stricken anonymity?

110
00:06:31,648 --> 00:06:35,527
No. Sorry.
I'm sure you've got it worse than I do.

111
00:06:35,694 --> 00:06:38,530
Whoa, whoa, I wouldn't go that far.

112
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,533
What I'm trying to say is...

113
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:44,202
there's another way to look at this.
- What's that?

114
00:06:44,369 --> 00:06:46,079
We're all in this together.

115
00:06:46,246 --> 00:06:49,791
Your brother's success is our success.
His home is our home.

116
00:06:49,958 --> 00:06:53,211
And most importantly, when
he's got a load on, his car is my car.

117
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:58,884
Hey, Berta, guess what.

118
00:06:59,384 --> 00:07:03,055
- I got another big royalty check.
- Oh, hey, good for you.

119
00:07:03,472 --> 00:07:07,142
- Why don't you celebrate with a drink?
- Well, I think I will.

120
00:07:08,894 --> 00:07:11,313
- Hey, Alan, guess what.
- Yeah, I heard.

121
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:12,939
Another big check.

122
00:07:16,026 --> 00:07:18,445
You know what's a great place
to pick up single moms?

123
00:07:18,612 --> 00:07:21,740
- The parking lot of Chuck E. Cheese.
- You didn't.

124
00:07:21,907 --> 00:07:24,743
And not just moms. Nannies, aunts...

125
00:07:24,910 --> 00:07:27,621
and a couple of very doable grandmas.

126
00:07:29,790 --> 00:07:30,999
Do you have any shame?

127
00:07:31,917 --> 00:07:33,752
No, why?

128
00:07:37,756 --> 00:07:39,257
Hello?

129
00:07:40,092 --> 00:07:41,176
Hang on.

130
00:07:43,178 --> 00:07:44,930
Who loves kids?

131
00:07:45,097 --> 00:07:47,349
Oh, hey, Artie.
Just got the check. Thanks.

132
00:07:47,516 --> 00:07:49,059
What's up?

133
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:52,771
Sure, I'll sign some CDs. Where?

134
00:07:53,105 --> 00:07:55,941
They got bookstores just for kids?
Who knew?

135
00:07:56,358 --> 00:07:58,527
Everyone but you.

136
00:07:58,693 --> 00:08:01,446
Okay, I'll be there. Thanks a lot.

137
00:08:01,613 --> 00:08:03,657
- Hey, Alan, guess what.
- There is no God?

138
00:08:03,824 --> 00:08:08,703
Oh, on the contrary,
there is a God, and he love me long time.

139
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:17,003
Who barfed in the fishbowl?
Who could it be?

140
00:08:17,462 --> 00:08:21,133
Who barfed in the fishbowl?
Oh, wait, it's me

141
00:08:21,299 --> 00:08:24,970
Fish food, fish food
I made some fish food

142
00:08:25,137 --> 00:08:29,141
Fish food, fish food
Mommy, come and see

143
00:08:35,313 --> 00:08:38,400
Love, Charlie Waffles.

144
00:08:38,567 --> 00:08:39,651
There you go, Dakota.

145
00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:43,321
- What do we say to Mr. Waffles?
- Thank you, Mr. Waffles.

146
00:08:43,488 --> 00:08:46,324
No, thank you, sweetheart.
And thank you, Mommy.

147
00:08:46,491 --> 00:08:49,578
So tell me, is there a Mrs. Waffles?

148
00:08:49,995 --> 00:08:53,582
- Sadly, no.
- Well, maybe this will cheer you up.

149
00:08:55,208 --> 00:08:56,751
Come on, honey.

150
00:08:57,252 --> 00:08:59,462
Oh, it do indeed.

151
00:09:00,005 --> 00:09:01,173
This guy's a phenomenon.

152
00:09:01,339 --> 00:09:04,509
The label's moved 100,000 units
in less than two weeks.

153
00:09:04,676 --> 00:09:08,096
The Wiggles can kiss my pasty,
white tushy.

154
00:09:09,055 --> 00:09:10,182
I'm sorry, who are you?

155
00:09:10,849 --> 00:09:14,436
Oh, I'm Artie Pliskin. President
and CEO of Fluffy Bunny Records.

156
00:09:14,603 --> 00:09:17,022
- And you are?
- Alan, Charlie's brother.

157
00:09:17,188 --> 00:09:19,024
Oh, you're the sponge. It's a pleasure.

158
00:09:21,985 --> 00:09:23,194
Same here.

159
00:09:25,196 --> 00:09:28,116
- Do you believe in God, Artie?
- I'll tell you what I believe in.

160
00:09:28,283 --> 00:09:32,370
Regular prostate exams, full-release
massage and Charlie freaking Waffles.

161
00:09:37,167 --> 00:09:40,420
Okay, kids, Charlie Waffles
needs to take a little potty break...

162
00:09:40,587 --> 00:09:42,464
but he'll be right back.

163
00:09:42,631 --> 00:09:45,467
In the meantime,
why don't you all sing along?

164
00:09:46,801 --> 00:09:48,595
It's potty time
Can 't hold it

165
00:09:49,054 --> 00:09:51,056
Can 't hold it
Can 't hold it

166
00:09:51,890 --> 00:09:54,059
Here, put this
in the "Mommy and Me" pile.

167
00:09:55,185 --> 00:09:56,394
I'll be right back.

168
00:09:56,561 --> 00:09:59,731
This is nothing compared to the concert
he's gonna give next weekend.

169
00:09:59,898 --> 00:10:01,566
- Concert?
- Concert?

170
00:10:01,733 --> 00:10:03,568
Twelve-hundred
screaming kids and moms...

171
00:10:03,735 --> 00:10:06,154
all dying to hear
Charlie Waffles sing in person.

172
00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:08,073
Twelve-hundred?

173
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:10,241
At 50 bucks a pop.

174
00:10:10,408 --> 00:10:15,246
Wait, wait a minute. He's gonna
make $60,000 off one concert?

175
00:10:15,413 --> 00:10:18,416
Yeah. Good time to be a sponge, huh?

176
00:10:21,169 --> 00:10:22,420
I'm not doing any concerts.

177
00:10:23,046 --> 00:10:26,424
- Why not?
- Because I'm not. Case closed.

178
00:10:26,966 --> 00:10:28,385
What's up with him?

179
00:10:28,551 --> 00:10:32,722
It would appear he's displeased with the
latest gold nugget to fall out of his ass.

180
00:10:32,889 --> 00:10:33,932
Yeah, well, trust me.

181
00:10:34,391 --> 00:10:38,853
The gold's gonna keep coming,
even if I have to get it myself.

182
00:10:40,939 --> 00:10:42,565
Potty
Potty

183
00:10:47,738 --> 00:10:49,281
So?

184
00:10:50,074 --> 00:10:52,201
Waffle for your thoughts?

185
00:10:52,493 --> 00:10:54,453
- Leave me alone.
- I don't understand.

186
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:58,124
I would think a sold-out concert
would be good news for Charlie Waffles.

187
00:10:58,290 --> 00:11:02,253
- Yeah, well, it's not.
- Because?

188
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:05,548
You ever wonder
why I never played in a band?

189
00:11:05,714 --> 00:11:07,842
I just figured you were
getting laid so much...

190
00:11:08,008 --> 00:11:10,553
being in a rock band
would seem redundant.

191
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:12,680
That's not the reason.

192
00:11:12,847 --> 00:11:15,057
Although I did do better
than most bass players.

193
00:11:15,224 --> 00:11:17,059
Okay, then what is the reason?

194
00:11:18,602 --> 00:11:21,605
- I have stage fright.
- You have stage fright?

195
00:11:21,772 --> 00:11:25,609
Severe, debilitating,
wet-your-pants stage fright.

196
00:11:31,073 --> 00:11:32,408
I don't understand.

197
00:11:34,201 --> 00:11:35,494
I've seen you perform.

198
00:11:35,995 --> 00:11:38,581
Well, sure, in the living room
for a couple of people.

199
00:11:38,747 --> 00:11:43,002
But on a stage with lights,
in front of a crowd paying to see me...

200
00:11:44,336 --> 00:11:46,505
Do you literally pee your pants?

201
00:11:47,548 --> 00:11:48,883
What difference does it make?

202
00:11:49,049 --> 00:11:51,677
I'm just saying your audience
is composed of bed wetters.

203
00:11:51,844 --> 00:11:55,097
They might get a kick out of
seeing you soil yourself.

204
00:11:55,639 --> 00:11:57,850
- And you think that'd be funny?
- No, I wouldn't.

205
00:11:58,017 --> 00:12:00,144
But I'm not your audience.

206
00:12:06,483 --> 00:12:08,027
Hello?

207
00:12:08,944 --> 00:12:11,322
I don't know what to tell you, Artie.
I can't do it.

208
00:12:11,864 --> 00:12:14,950
- I don't need a reason why.
- Just tell him the truth.

209
00:12:15,951 --> 00:12:19,288
It's show business, Alan,
you don't tell people the truth.

210
00:12:20,414 --> 00:12:23,125
Look, I'll make the CDs,
I'll shoot the commercials...

211
00:12:23,292 --> 00:12:26,170
I'll even do the bookstores.
Just no concerts.

212
00:12:27,671 --> 00:12:30,841
Hey, I don't have to do anything.

213
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:33,135
Oh, yeah?
What are you gonna do, sue me?

214
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,222
Really?

215
00:12:38,933 --> 00:12:41,310
- Can he sue me?
- Did you sign a contract?

216
00:12:41,810 --> 00:12:43,395
What time is the concert?

217
00:12:45,314 --> 00:12:47,316
Okay, see you Saturday night.

218
00:12:47,483 --> 00:12:50,361
Wait, wait, wait. Eleven a. M?

219
00:12:50,527 --> 00:12:53,572
Who goes to concerts at 11 a. M?

220
00:12:54,239 --> 00:12:56,116
Oh, yeah.

221
00:12:57,326 --> 00:12:59,620
Stupid kids.

222
00:13:03,082 --> 00:13:04,583
It's quarter to 1

223
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:07,044
You want to have a little fun

224
00:13:07,211 --> 00:13:08,379
You brush your teeth

225
00:13:09,213 --> 00:13:10,923
What are you watching?

226
00:13:11,674 --> 00:13:13,092
The master at work.

227
00:13:13,258 --> 00:13:15,761
You wake up in the morning
And it's quarter to 2

228
00:13:15,928 --> 00:13:19,682
You want to find something to do
You brush your teeth

229
00:13:22,059 --> 00:13:24,812
Oh, Raffi,
you magnificent son of a bitch.

230
00:13:27,272 --> 00:13:30,025
How do you do it?
How does he do it, Alan?

231
00:13:30,192 --> 00:13:31,568
What's he got that I don't?

232
00:13:32,194 --> 00:13:33,862
Well, based on first impressions...

233
00:13:34,029 --> 00:13:37,616
I'd say, a genuine love of children,
and bladder control.

234
00:13:38,992 --> 00:13:42,287
- Well, that was just a cheap shot.
- I take them when I get them.

235
00:13:43,872 --> 00:13:47,334
Look at him. All relaxed and smiling.

236
00:13:47,793 --> 00:13:50,212
Last time I was
in front of an audience like that...

237
00:13:50,379 --> 00:13:51,880
seventh-grade talent show...

238
00:13:52,047 --> 00:13:55,050
I started shaking, sweating,
felt like I wanted to throw up.

239
00:13:55,217 --> 00:13:57,219
Don't forget peeing in your pants.

240
00:13:59,888 --> 00:14:01,724
You keep pitching me fat ones.

241
00:14:03,851 --> 00:14:05,936
- I'm not talking to you anymore.
- Oh, come on.

242
00:14:06,103 --> 00:14:09,189
Look, if you knew in the seventh grade
that you couldn't perform...

243
00:14:09,356 --> 00:14:11,108
why'd you become a musician?

244
00:14:11,275 --> 00:14:14,445
Because there's one thing
I am more afraid of than an audience.

245
00:14:14,611 --> 00:14:16,238
What's that? An honest day's work?

246
00:14:17,948 --> 00:14:21,076
If you knew the answer,
why'd you ask the question?

247
00:14:25,914 --> 00:14:27,583
Charlie Waffles. Charlie Waffles.

248
00:14:27,749 --> 00:14:29,126
Where the hell is he, Alan?

249
00:14:29,293 --> 00:14:32,421
I don't know. He said he wanted to
take a walk to calm himself down.

250
00:14:32,588 --> 00:14:34,882
I promise you,
I will crucify that son of a bitch.

251
00:14:35,048 --> 00:14:37,509
The two of you will be
in a box over a heating vent...

252
00:14:37,676 --> 00:14:39,344
when I get through suing him.

253
00:14:39,928 --> 00:14:42,764
Could it be a box with a guest room?

254
00:14:43,474 --> 00:14:44,516
Hey, Alan.

255
00:14:45,142 --> 00:14:47,269
I figured out what went wrong
in seventh grade.

256
00:14:47,436 --> 00:14:48,520
What?

257
00:14:49,104 --> 00:14:51,607
I hadn't started drinking yet.

258
00:14:53,442 --> 00:14:57,112
- Charlie, you have to get out there.
- Right.

259
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:59,114
The little bastards await.

260
00:15:02,659 --> 00:15:05,496
You can't sue him
if he just stinks, right?

261
00:15:12,711 --> 00:15:14,296
Who loves kids?

262
00:15:14,463 --> 00:15:17,090
Charlie Waffles.

263
00:15:17,257 --> 00:15:19,092
You're damn right.

264
00:15:46,745 --> 00:15:48,872
That one's not on the CD.

265
00:15:50,832 --> 00:15:52,417
Let's try this again.

266
00:15:56,296 --> 00:15:59,967
I drink from a sippy cup
Sippy cup, sippy cup

267
00:16:00,133 --> 00:16:02,928
I drink from a sippy cup
'Cause I'm a big kid now

268
00:16:03,095 --> 00:16:04,137
Come on

269
00:16:04,304 --> 00:16:07,975
I drink from a sippy cup
Sippy cup, sippy cup

270
00:16:08,141 --> 00:16:11,645
I drink from a sippy cup
'Cause I'm a big kid now

271
00:16:11,812 --> 00:16:13,772
Bye-bye, boobies

272
00:16:13,939 --> 00:16:15,691
They love him.

273
00:16:15,857 --> 00:16:17,776
How can they love him?

274
00:16:17,943 --> 00:16:20,988
Who cares? We're gonna make a fortune.

275
00:16:21,154 --> 00:16:24,658
- Doesn't it bother you that he's loaded?
- He's a musician.

276
00:16:24,825 --> 00:16:26,159
It'd bother me if he wasn't.

277
00:16:26,326 --> 00:16:29,997
Bye-bye, boobies

278
00:16:30,163 --> 00:16:33,583
Bye-bye, boobies

279
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:39,923
Bye-bye, boobies
'Cause I'm a big kid now

280
00:16:45,178 --> 00:16:46,346
Who loves boobies?

281
00:16:46,513 --> 00:16:50,017
Charlie Waffles.

282
00:16:52,352 --> 00:16:54,354
Right.

283
00:16:59,109 --> 00:17:02,404
I love boobies
I love boobies

284
00:17:02,571 --> 00:17:04,865
I love boobies
'Cause I'm a big kid now

285
00:17:05,031 --> 00:17:06,074
Come on

286
00:17:06,241 --> 00:17:09,411
I love boobies
I love boobies

287
00:17:09,578 --> 00:17:12,873
I love boobies
'Cause I'm a big kid now

288
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:19,773
- Hi.
- Hey.

289
00:17:20,732 --> 00:17:23,735
- What are you doing up so late?
- I couldn't sleep.

290
00:17:25,737 --> 00:17:27,947
- Something bothering you?
- It's nothing.

291
00:17:28,406 --> 00:17:31,951
Oh, come on, I'm your brother.
You can tell me anything.

292
00:17:32,744 --> 00:17:37,665
Well, the truth is,
your life has been going so great lately.

293
00:17:37,832 --> 00:17:40,377
It's been bringing up
a lot of old resentment in me...

294
00:17:40,543 --> 00:17:41,878
Who loves kids?

295
00:17:42,045 --> 00:17:43,421
Charlie Waffles.

296
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:50,095
For the first time anywhere,
if your kids love Charlie Waffles...

297
00:17:50,261 --> 00:17:53,389
they'll love him even more, live.

298
00:17:53,556 --> 00:17:57,143
When Mom 's a big meanie
And serves you zucchini

299
00:17:57,602 --> 00:17:59,229
What do you do?

300
00:17:59,395 --> 00:18:00,772
What do you do?

301
00:18:00,939 --> 00:18:02,565
Feed it to the dog

302
00:18:04,526 --> 00:18:06,069
Feed it to the dog

303
00:18:07,195 --> 00:18:08,238
That's right.

304
00:18:08,404 --> 00:18:14,494
Charlie's first sold-out concert
can be yours on D VD for only 29.99.

305
00:18:14,661 --> 00:18:18,498
Who barfed in the fishbowl?
Who could it be?

306
00:18:18,665 --> 00:18:21,918
Who barfed in the fishbowl?
Oh, wait, it's me

307
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:26,005
Fish food, fish food
I made some fish food

308
00:18:26,172 --> 00:18:29,926
Fish food, fish food
Mommy, come and see

309
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:31,845
Plus, if you order now...

310
00:18:32,303 --> 00:18:33,596
You know what's funny, Alan?

311
00:18:34,013 --> 00:18:36,766
I was so hammered,
I have no memory of that concert.

312
00:18:37,475 --> 00:18:40,353
Gee, that is funny.

313
00:18:40,770 --> 00:18:43,898
- Oh, Charlie Waffles.
- Yeah, baby?

314
00:18:44,065 --> 00:18:46,025
Who loves boobies?

315
00:18:46,484 --> 00:18:48,069
Coming.

316
00:18:48,778 --> 00:18:52,699
Excuse me.
Time to butter up the old waffle.

317
00:18:53,491 --> 00:18:56,244
Yeah, well, thanks for the talk.

318
00:18:56,703 --> 00:18:57,745
What talk?

319
00:18:57,912 --> 00:19:00,206
Go, butter.

320
00:19:06,796 --> 00:19:08,548
It's potty time
Can 't hold it

321
00:19:08,715 --> 00:19:10,884
Can 't hold it
Can 't hold it

322
00:19:11,718 --> 00:19:14,637
Potty, potty, potty

323
00:19:14,804 --> 00:19:15,847
Potty

324
00:19:16,014 --> 00:19:19,434
- Potty, potty, potty
- Potty

325
00:19:19,601 --> 00:19:21,853
I'm not wearing a diaper
And I'm not in the pool

326
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:24,606
Get out of the bathroom
Gotta go, fool

327
00:19:24,772 --> 00:19:28,651
- Potty, potty, potty
- Potty

328
00:19:28,818 --> 00:19:30,737
Might be number one
It might be number two

329
00:19:30,903 --> 00:19:32,905
I don 't know yet
And neither do you

330
00:19:33,573 --> 00:19:36,409
Potty, potty, potty

331
00:19:36,576 --> 00:19:37,827
Potty

332
00:19:38,745 --> 00:19:40,246
Potty
