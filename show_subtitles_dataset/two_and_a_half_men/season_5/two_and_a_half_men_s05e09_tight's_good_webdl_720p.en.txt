1
00:00:06,061 --> 00:00:09,981
I'd like to propose a toast
to my beautiful bride-to-be.

2
00:00:10,524 --> 00:00:13,068
Darling,
I never thought I'd find love again.

3
00:00:13,235 --> 00:00:17,531
I not only found it,
but I found the love of my life.

4
00:00:17,697 --> 00:00:18,824
To Evelyn.

5
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:20,659
- Hear, hear.
- Hear, hear.

6
00:00:21,076 --> 00:00:23,745
That poor, clueless bastard.

7
00:00:24,287 --> 00:00:28,166
It's like watching a dog
stick his face in a fan.

8
00:00:28,333 --> 00:00:30,502
You don't do that more than once.

9
00:00:33,255 --> 00:00:36,299
I am the lucky one in this relationship.

10
00:00:36,466 --> 00:00:38,009
And I promise you, darling...

11
00:00:38,176 --> 00:00:43,223
I am going to be the best wife
I possibly can.

12
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:44,433
To Teddy.

13
00:00:44,599 --> 00:00:46,017
- Teddy.
- To Teddy.

14
00:00:46,184 --> 00:00:48,812
That poor, clueless bastard.

15
00:00:49,688 --> 00:00:52,357
- So can we go now?
- No, we can't. It would be rude.

16
00:00:52,524 --> 00:00:53,608
I don't mind being rude.

17
00:00:54,109 --> 00:00:55,944
You just talking or you got a plan?

18
00:00:56,403 --> 00:00:59,072
Well, if I eat enough shrimp,
I can make myself puke.

19
00:00:59,239 --> 00:01:00,282
Then start eating.

20
00:01:00,448 --> 00:01:02,868
Okay, stop it, both of you.
There will be no puking.

21
00:01:03,034 --> 00:01:05,287
We're gonna stay,
congratulate the happy couple...

22
00:01:05,453 --> 00:01:08,165
mingle a bit,
and then I'm gonna fake a migraine.

23
00:01:08,748 --> 00:01:10,208
- You can do that?
- Hell, yeah.

24
00:01:10,375 --> 00:01:14,045
I spent 12 years watching my wife
fake migraines and orgasms.

25
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16,298
I'd go with the migraine.

26
00:01:18,466 --> 00:01:20,552
Thanks for coming, fellas.
Means a lot to me.

27
00:01:21,344 --> 00:01:22,387
Wouldn't miss it.

28
00:01:22,554 --> 00:01:25,849
We wish you a lifetime
of love and happiness. Right, Charlie?

29
00:01:26,016 --> 00:01:29,644
Well, yeah, but he seems
hell-bent on marrying Mom.

30
00:01:30,103 --> 00:01:32,647
Hey, Daddy. Sorry I'm late.

31
00:01:32,814 --> 00:01:34,065
That's okay, doodlebug.

32
00:01:34,482 --> 00:01:36,735
Just glad you could make it.

33
00:01:37,819 --> 00:01:41,323
Charlie, Alan, Jake,
this is my daughter, Courtney.

34
00:01:41,489 --> 00:01:43,825
Honey,
these are Evelyn's sons and grandson.

35
00:01:44,242 --> 00:01:45,327
I'm the grandson.

36
00:01:45,744 --> 00:01:49,831
- Oh, well, it's nice to finally meet you all.
- Nice to meet you too.

37
00:01:49,998 --> 00:01:51,458
So, Teddy, what's the deal?

38
00:01:51,625 --> 00:01:54,669
All this time, you've been hiding
this beautiful woman from us?

39
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:57,505
Just from you, Charlie.

40
00:01:58,173 --> 00:02:00,759
- Fair enough.
- Dad's a little overprotective.

41
00:02:01,176 --> 00:02:02,427
I can see why.

42
00:02:02,844 --> 00:02:05,680
Charlie, why don't you and I
get Courtney a drink?

43
00:02:05,847 --> 00:02:08,350
I'd like to get Courtney a house.

44
00:02:08,934 --> 00:02:10,977
Walk with me.

45
00:02:11,895 --> 00:02:14,356
- How's your headache, Dad?
- Not yet. So...

46
00:02:16,107 --> 00:02:19,945
Courtney, you have amazing posture.
Do you see a chiropractor?

47
00:02:20,487 --> 00:02:23,073
- No.
- Would you like to?

48
00:02:23,782 --> 00:02:27,535
- Charlie, I need you to do me a favor.
- Anything for you, Teddy. Name it.

49
00:02:27,702 --> 00:02:30,956
- Stay away from Courtney.
- Name something else.

50
00:02:31,373 --> 00:02:33,291
- Charlie, this is important.
- Don't worry.

51
00:02:33,458 --> 00:02:35,960
I think too much of you
to wanna, you know...

52
00:02:36,127 --> 00:02:38,380
do what I wanna do
with your daughter.

53
00:02:39,214 --> 00:02:41,549
- I appreciate that.
- Consider it a wedding present.

54
00:02:41,966 --> 00:02:44,552
- Thanks.
- No, seriously, that's all you get.

55
00:02:46,763 --> 00:02:48,973
Courtney, dear,
what a surprise to see you.

56
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:53,436
- Well, I told you I was coming.
- Yes, but the party started an hour ago.

57
00:02:53,603 --> 00:02:57,107
So I naturally assumed that something
had come up that was more important...

58
00:02:57,273 --> 00:02:58,733
than your father's happiness.

59
00:03:00,235 --> 00:03:03,113
Well, Evelyn, you know
what they say about assuming.

60
00:03:03,279 --> 00:03:06,783
When you assume, you're just a bitch.

61
00:03:07,575 --> 00:03:12,247
- Courtney, there are children present.
- She means me, but I'm fine with it.

62
00:03:13,206 --> 00:03:14,249
Thank you, dear.

63
00:03:14,416 --> 00:03:16,793
You should hear
what they call her at home.

64
00:03:17,544 --> 00:03:19,963
- Have some shrimp.
- Oh, boy.

65
00:03:20,422 --> 00:03:24,259
- Well, great party, but we gotta go.
- Oh, already?

66
00:03:24,426 --> 00:03:27,137
Yeah. We'd love to stay,
but Alan's got a headache.

67
00:03:27,303 --> 00:03:28,930
Not yet.

68
00:03:29,848 --> 00:03:33,101
Not yet debilitating,
but I do need to lay down.

69
00:03:33,268 --> 00:03:37,856
Hey, before you go, my dad
had mentioned that you like nice cars.

70
00:03:38,273 --> 00:03:39,524
- Yeah.
- I do too.

71
00:03:41,067 --> 00:03:42,402
Swell.

72
00:03:42,569 --> 00:03:45,196
Here's my card.
Maybe I can help you out someday.

73
00:03:45,363 --> 00:03:47,615
Whoa, Ferraris, Lamborghinis.

74
00:03:47,782 --> 00:03:51,744
They say driving one is the most fun
you can have with your pants on.

75
00:03:53,288 --> 00:03:57,459
Well, that's how I like to drive.
With my pants on.

76
00:03:57,625 --> 00:04:00,462
Otherwise,
the leather kind of sticks to my thighs.

77
00:04:00,628 --> 00:04:03,548
Well, you should come down sometime.
I'll give you a test drive.

78
00:04:03,965 --> 00:04:08,303
- Actually, I'm really not a Ferrari guy.
- I'm not either.

79
00:04:10,305 --> 00:04:11,681
- Bye.
- Bye-bye.

80
00:04:11,848 --> 00:04:15,310
We really gotta get our signals straight.
I mean, you made me look stupid.

81
00:04:15,602 --> 00:04:17,979
Don't blame your father for that.

82
00:04:19,147 --> 00:04:22,817
I'm telling you right now,
I'm not having any more children.

83
00:04:24,068 --> 00:04:25,862
Terrific.

84
00:04:58,337 --> 00:04:59,713
Hello?

85
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:01,673
No, it's Alan.

86
00:05:02,257 --> 00:05:04,092
Oh, hi, Courtney.

87
00:05:04,384 --> 00:05:07,554
Well, it was very nice
meeting you last night too.

88
00:05:08,513 --> 00:05:09,556
Oh, I'm sorry...

89
00:05:09,723 --> 00:05:14,144
I had no idea that you were planning
on using a fake migraine to get out early.

90
00:05:15,479 --> 00:05:17,898
So, what did you do?

91
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:20,567
Menstrual cramps.

92
00:05:21,234 --> 00:05:23,487
Yeah, I can't get away with that.

93
00:05:24,029 --> 00:05:26,823
Although sometimes
I'll use irritable bowel syndrome.

94
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:28,367
And...

95
00:05:29,242 --> 00:05:31,119
Okay, I'll get Charlie.

96
00:05:33,246 --> 00:05:35,582
It's Teddy's daughter.
She wants to talk to you.

97
00:05:35,749 --> 00:05:38,043
- Really?
- You promised Teddy you'd stay away.

98
00:05:38,210 --> 00:05:40,045
Hey, I didn't tell her to call me.

99
00:05:40,212 --> 00:05:42,798
What kind of man
would hit on his future stepsister?

100
00:05:44,299 --> 00:05:46,927
You're just making it hotter for him.

101
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,847
Give me the phone, give me the phone.

102
00:05:52,224 --> 00:05:53,725
Hi, Courtney, what's up?

103
00:05:55,143 --> 00:05:58,438
That's nice, but I told you,
I'm really not into Ferraris.

104
00:05:59,523 --> 00:06:03,693
A Bentley?
Oh, it's a little more my style.

105
00:06:03,902 --> 00:06:06,571
Okay, I guess I could come by
and take a peek at it.

106
00:06:06,738 --> 00:06:08,573
First a peek, then a poke.

107
00:06:15,789 --> 00:06:17,624
Uncalled for.

108
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:22,921
Two o'clock? Great. I'll see you then.

109
00:06:27,801 --> 00:06:29,928
I swear this is just business.

110
00:06:30,762 --> 00:06:33,348
I'm going to look at a Bentley
she got in on trade.

111
00:06:33,515 --> 00:06:35,433
I can get it for dealer cost.

112
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:38,854
- Since when do you need a Bentley?
- Nobody needs a Bentley, Alan.

113
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:41,898
Just like nobody needs
to date a woman half their age.

114
00:06:42,065 --> 00:06:44,609
But if you want one,
it doesn't hurt to have the other.

115
00:06:48,572 --> 00:06:51,032
Did Teddy tell you
to stay away from his daughter too?

116
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:54,286
- No.
- Yeah, why would he?

117
00:07:05,505 --> 00:07:07,549
Pretty hot, isn't it?

118
00:07:08,091 --> 00:07:11,136
Oh, yeah. But it's not really my thing.

119
00:07:11,303 --> 00:07:14,097
Gee, I think a guy like you
would look great in one of these.

120
00:07:14,264 --> 00:07:15,682
- You think?
- Absolutely.

121
00:07:16,182 --> 00:07:20,186
Here. Slide on into it. See how it feels.

122
00:07:22,564 --> 00:07:23,732
What about the Bentley?

123
00:07:23,899 --> 00:07:27,777
I got the guys in the back washing it up
for you. We have a few minutes.

124
00:07:27,944 --> 00:07:29,029
Sure, why not.

125
00:07:29,738 --> 00:07:31,698
That's always been my motto.

126
00:07:35,493 --> 00:07:37,329
Oh, pretty snug.

127
00:07:38,371 --> 00:07:40,040
Tight's good, don't you think?

128
00:07:43,835 --> 00:07:46,129
Sure, tight's good.

129
00:07:49,674 --> 00:07:51,092
Oh, hi.

130
00:07:51,801 --> 00:07:53,303
Hi.

131
00:07:53,845 --> 00:07:56,056
So where do they put the engine
in these things?

132
00:07:56,222 --> 00:07:59,559
They put it where it belongs. In the rear.

133
00:08:09,819 --> 00:08:12,405
- So no stick?
- No, you shift from the wheel.

134
00:08:12,572 --> 00:08:13,907
Let me show you.

135
00:08:14,074 --> 00:08:16,910
Left side down, right side up.

136
00:08:17,619 --> 00:08:19,663
You don't need a stick.

137
00:08:19,829 --> 00:08:21,998
And yet I've got one anyway.

138
00:08:28,588 --> 00:08:30,965
- Is that your cell phone?
- Boy, I hope so.

139
00:08:32,884 --> 00:08:34,719
Excuse me.

140
00:08:35,053 --> 00:08:36,096
Hello?

141
00:08:36,262 --> 00:08:40,767
Oh, hey, hey, hey. Teddy, how are you?

142
00:08:42,185 --> 00:08:44,979
Good. Me? I'm fine.

143
00:08:45,605 --> 00:08:48,608
Just running some errands.

144
00:08:48,817 --> 00:08:52,237
Yeah, I'll be around tomorrow.
Drop by anytime.

145
00:08:52,404 --> 00:08:53,905
Great. I'll see you then.

146
00:08:55,782 --> 00:08:57,742
That was your dad.

147
00:08:59,411 --> 00:09:01,663
He wants to talk to me and Alan
about something.

148
00:09:01,830 --> 00:09:03,164
I heard.

149
00:09:03,331 --> 00:09:07,836
- Has he ever said anything about me?
- You? Let me think.

150
00:09:08,002 --> 00:09:10,296
He told you to stay away from me,
didn't he?

151
00:09:10,755 --> 00:09:11,923
Oh, yeah, there was that.

152
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:16,719
I can't believe
he's still trying to control my life.

153
00:09:16,886 --> 00:09:18,763
Hey, your dad loves you.

154
00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:22,767
He's just trying to protect you from,
well, in this case, me.

155
00:09:24,686 --> 00:09:27,856
I'm a big girl, Charlie,
I can take care of myself.

156
00:09:28,314 --> 00:09:29,524
I'm sure you can.

157
00:09:30,859 --> 00:09:34,946
I can also take care of
whoever I choose to be with.

158
00:09:35,113 --> 00:09:37,157
I'm sure you can.

159
00:09:43,830 --> 00:09:48,835
Listen, I appreciate the offer,
but I think I'm gonna pass.

160
00:09:49,002 --> 00:09:50,461
On the Bentley.

161
00:09:52,297 --> 00:09:54,340
But you haven't even seen it yet.

162
00:09:54,507 --> 00:09:59,470
And right now, it's all wet and soapy,
just waiting for you.

163
00:10:07,353 --> 00:10:09,856
Are we still talking about a car?

164
00:10:12,025 --> 00:10:13,359
What do you think?

165
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:17,989
I think I should probably get out
before I set off the air bag.

166
00:10:22,619 --> 00:10:27,790
And then she leaned over real close
to play with the... paddles.

167
00:10:28,583 --> 00:10:29,959
The what?

168
00:10:30,126 --> 00:10:32,045
The paddle shifters
on the steering wheel.

169
00:10:34,422 --> 00:10:36,883
I had another picture entirely.

170
00:10:39,719 --> 00:10:41,220
But I restrained myself.

171
00:10:41,387 --> 00:10:44,390
I walked away,
and now I can still look Teddy in the eye.

172
00:10:44,849 --> 00:10:45,934
That's great.

173
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:48,728
But how come you have no problem
looking me in the eye...

174
00:10:48,895 --> 00:10:52,857
after sleeping with my wife's sister,
my son's teacher, my divorce lawyer...

175
00:10:53,024 --> 00:10:54,525
and my old receptionist?

176
00:10:55,610 --> 00:10:57,028
I like Teddy.

177
00:11:00,448 --> 00:11:03,201
- And the receptionist was your fault.
- How?

178
00:11:04,202 --> 00:11:07,246
If you'd paid her a decent salary,
she wouldn't have had to hook.

179
00:11:12,877 --> 00:11:14,545
I brought the Bentley.

180
00:11:14,962 --> 00:11:17,298
Come on, Courtney. I told you I can't.

181
00:11:17,799 --> 00:11:21,803
Just one little test drive.
What do you have to lose?

182
00:11:22,345 --> 00:11:26,265
Well, there's my integrity, my self
respect, my relationship with your father...

183
00:11:26,432 --> 00:11:28,434
Give me the damn keys.

184
00:11:33,523 --> 00:11:35,650
Is your brother still in bed
with his sister?

185
00:11:42,365 --> 00:11:44,200
Stepsister.

186
00:11:45,243 --> 00:11:46,744
To-be.

187
00:11:47,578 --> 00:11:49,288
And yes.

188
00:11:49,747 --> 00:11:51,207
Wow, how long has it been?

189
00:11:53,042 --> 00:11:54,544
About 18 hours.

190
00:11:55,253 --> 00:11:57,130
Good thing he's got supplies up there.

191
00:11:58,172 --> 00:12:00,174
- He does?
- Sure.

192
00:12:00,341 --> 00:12:04,178
Water, power bars, fresh batteries, rope.

193
00:12:05,430 --> 00:12:06,806
Oh, like an earthquake kit.

194
00:12:09,642 --> 00:12:12,603
I guess you could use that stuff
for earthquakes.

195
00:12:21,446 --> 00:12:23,114
Oh, crap.

196
00:12:26,409 --> 00:12:29,078
Misdirected anger. You'll get used to it.

197
00:12:29,537 --> 00:12:32,957
- What are you guys doing here?
- We came to talk with you and Charlie.

198
00:12:33,124 --> 00:12:34,250
Didn't he tell you?

199
00:12:34,417 --> 00:12:38,629
He never tells me anything. I don't know
half of what he does nor do I want to.

200
00:12:38,796 --> 00:12:42,300
It's his life and he alone should suffer
the consequences. Come on in.

201
00:12:44,844 --> 00:12:47,722
- Is he even home?
- I'll check.

202
00:12:47,889 --> 00:12:51,058
Why don't you make yourselves
comfortable...

203
00:12:51,434 --> 00:12:52,643
and I'll check.

204
00:12:54,812 --> 00:12:56,564
Because I have no idea.

205
00:12:57,940 --> 00:13:00,735
So I'll need to check.

206
00:13:07,241 --> 00:13:08,409
Is he on something?

207
00:13:09,035 --> 00:13:10,995
If only.

208
00:13:14,207 --> 00:13:15,750
What?

209
00:13:17,001 --> 00:13:18,669
Teddy and Mom are downstairs.

210
00:13:18,836 --> 00:13:22,006
- What the hell are they doing here?
- Apparently, you invited them.

211
00:13:22,173 --> 00:13:23,716
- I did not.
- Yes, you did.

212
00:13:23,883 --> 00:13:25,551
On the phone, remember? Hey, Alan.

213
00:13:25,718 --> 00:13:28,387
Hi, Courtney, how are you doing?
Charlie, they're waiting.

214
00:13:28,930 --> 00:13:30,556
Yeah, we got a problem here.

215
00:13:30,723 --> 00:13:34,060
No, sir, you've got a problem.
I made no promise, I broke no promise.

216
00:13:34,226 --> 00:13:35,853
- You actually made a promise?
- Yeah.

217
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:38,522
- And I really tried to keep it.
- He did.

218
00:13:38,689 --> 00:13:42,777
I could sense his inner conflict as we
did it in the back seat of the Bentley.

219
00:13:45,696 --> 00:13:48,115
Look, just stall them. I'll be right down.

220
00:13:48,282 --> 00:13:51,118
Fine. But know this,
I am not taking the fall for you.

221
00:13:51,285 --> 00:13:53,621
- How could you take the fall for me?
- I don't know.

222
00:13:53,788 --> 00:13:57,041
But it always seems to work out
that when you get laid, I get screwed.

223
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:00,044
Just go.

224
00:14:01,629 --> 00:14:05,007
- Great. Just great.
- Hey, have you seen my dress?

225
00:14:05,675 --> 00:14:08,219
- Why?
- I ain't going down like this.

226
00:14:09,387 --> 00:14:11,222
You're not going down at all.

227
00:14:12,348 --> 00:14:15,184
Why not?
I have nothing to be ashamed of.

228
00:14:15,977 --> 00:14:18,562
Here, hit rewind.
I'm sure you'll find something.

229
00:14:24,568 --> 00:14:26,404
I just can't believe he's still in bed.

230
00:14:26,570 --> 00:14:28,406
He's a drunk, Mom.
That's what they do.

231
00:14:28,864 --> 00:14:30,741
Oh, come on, Evelyn,
give the kid a break.

232
00:14:30,908 --> 00:14:33,494
He was probably out late last night
sowing wild oats.

233
00:14:33,911 --> 00:14:36,997
He's 40 years old,
he has no more wild oats.

234
00:14:37,164 --> 00:14:39,834
Just warmed-over cream of wheat.

235
00:14:40,251 --> 00:14:43,087
Hey, hey, look who's here.

236
00:14:43,254 --> 00:14:45,923
Well, thanks for interrupting
your stupor and joining us.

237
00:14:46,090 --> 00:14:49,510
I can get back to my stupor anytime.
So, what's going on?

238
00:14:50,052 --> 00:14:52,388
Your mother and I wanted to
talk about the wedding.

239
00:14:52,555 --> 00:14:54,765
You've got my blessing. What else?

240
00:14:54,932 --> 00:14:57,768
Well, we wondered if you would mind
having the ceremony here.

241
00:14:57,935 --> 00:14:58,978
Sure. Terrific.

242
00:14:59,145 --> 00:15:02,148
On the deck, in here, on the beach,
wherever you want. What else?

243
00:15:02,481 --> 00:15:03,941
Don't you wanna think about it?

244
00:15:04,108 --> 00:15:07,361
What's to think about? It's perfect.
Have the ceremony, the reception.

245
00:15:07,528 --> 00:15:11,824
Alan and I'll clear out. You can use this
place for your honeymoon. It's broken in.

246
00:15:11,991 --> 00:15:13,117
The house, not Mom.

247
00:15:20,124 --> 00:15:23,169
Do you have one of your
little pop tarts up there?

248
00:15:23,586 --> 00:15:26,881
No, no, just my alarm.
If I'm not up by 4 in the afternoon...

249
00:15:27,047 --> 00:15:30,468
I feel like I've wasted the whole day.
Be right back.

250
00:15:36,348 --> 00:15:38,350
- What do you think you're doing?
- I'm bored.

251
00:15:38,934 --> 00:15:41,604
- You're bored?
- Yeah. I wanna go downstairs.

252
00:15:41,770 --> 00:15:44,815
No, no, no, you can't go downstairs.
Find something else to do.

253
00:15:44,982 --> 00:15:47,651
Well, I'd love to sell you a car.

254
00:15:49,904 --> 00:15:51,197
Yeah, very funny.

255
00:15:52,448 --> 00:15:53,866
No, I'm serious.

256
00:15:55,534 --> 00:15:57,119
You wanna sell me a car now?

257
00:15:57,661 --> 00:16:00,748
Or I could go downstairs.

258
00:16:00,915 --> 00:16:02,833
You wouldn't.

259
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,668
I would.

260
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:07,796
Wait a minute.

261
00:16:07,963 --> 00:16:11,050
You planned this.
You knew they were coming over today.

262
00:16:11,217 --> 00:16:13,844
Well, a good salesman pays attention.

263
00:16:14,011 --> 00:16:17,139
- Now, if you'll excuse me.
- Okay, okay, okay, you win.

264
00:16:17,556 --> 00:16:20,684
- Give me a price on the Bentley.
- The Bentley's no longer available.

265
00:16:20,851 --> 00:16:22,686
I'm thinking the Ferrari.

266
00:16:23,687 --> 00:16:26,732
- I don't want a Ferrari.
- And I don't want to stay up here.

267
00:16:26,899 --> 00:16:30,402
- Charlie, we're waiting.
- Coming.

268
00:16:30,569 --> 00:16:31,946
Okay, fine.

269
00:16:32,988 --> 00:16:37,034
But let me just say,
this is no way to treat family.

270
00:16:38,202 --> 00:16:40,704
Here we go, blue eyes.

271
00:16:40,871 --> 00:16:43,207
- I made it myself.
- Oh, thank you.

272
00:16:43,374 --> 00:16:46,919
- Nothing for me, thanks.
- I don't recall offering.

273
00:16:49,046 --> 00:16:51,048
Sorry, sorry.

274
00:16:51,215 --> 00:16:54,551
So, wedding on the beach. Great.
I'll take care of everything.

275
00:16:54,718 --> 00:16:57,972
- Thanks for stopping by.
- Well, there is one more thing.

276
00:16:58,430 --> 00:16:59,723
- Name it.
- Well...

277
00:16:59,890 --> 00:17:03,727
Excuse me.
Berta, this is a family matter.

278
00:17:06,897 --> 00:17:08,524
If you only knew.

279
00:17:10,776 --> 00:17:12,444
Here's the deal.

280
00:17:12,611 --> 00:17:15,572
I never had any sons of my own,
just the one daughter.

281
00:17:15,739 --> 00:17:18,742
- And she's great. Isn't she great, Alan?
- Well, I hardly met her.

282
00:17:18,909 --> 00:17:22,204
- Me neither. I'm sure she's great.
- She's terrific.

283
00:17:22,371 --> 00:17:24,707
But I've grown very fond
of the two of you.

284
00:17:24,873 --> 00:17:28,961
And I'd like to ask you to stand up
with me when I marry your mother.

285
00:17:31,005 --> 00:17:35,718
- Teddy, that's quite an honor.
- Yeah. I'm really touched.

286
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:42,349
Snooze button.
I must have hit the snooze button.

287
00:17:42,516 --> 00:17:44,101
Excuse me.

288
00:17:46,854 --> 00:17:50,149
I don't use the snooze button.
When I'm up, I'm up.

289
00:17:52,317 --> 00:17:53,610
Of course, I'm not a drunk.

290
00:17:59,283 --> 00:18:00,492
Are you out of your mind?

291
00:18:01,326 --> 00:18:05,497
I prefer to think of myself as a go-getter.
All right, now you're gonna wanna...

292
00:18:05,664 --> 00:18:08,959
sign here, here, here,
and initial where the little flags are.

293
00:18:10,294 --> 00:18:12,963
This is twice as much as the Bentley.
I can't afford this.

294
00:18:13,630 --> 00:18:15,758
Well, if you need help
with the down payment...

295
00:18:15,924 --> 00:18:20,095
I'm sure I could ask my dad
to help you out. He really loves you.

296
00:18:25,267 --> 00:18:26,477
Fine.

297
00:18:27,311 --> 00:18:30,230
Here. And here. And here.

298
00:18:30,397 --> 00:18:32,232
And here. And here.

299
00:18:32,691 --> 00:18:34,902
- What's this?
- Oh, that's the extended warranty.

300
00:18:35,068 --> 00:18:37,446
Just a little extra protection.

301
00:18:37,613 --> 00:18:39,907
I think it's a bit late for that.

302
00:18:40,574 --> 00:18:43,202
Congratulations. You now own a Ferrari.

303
00:18:43,994 --> 00:18:45,370
Yippee.

304
00:18:46,830 --> 00:18:48,499
Charlie.

305
00:18:49,124 --> 00:18:50,167
What now?

306
00:18:51,418 --> 00:18:52,920
I'm gonna need a check.

307
00:18:59,676 --> 00:19:02,971
You know, this is the most
I have ever spent for sex.

308
00:19:05,766 --> 00:19:07,351
But not by much.

309
00:19:13,357 --> 00:19:15,692
Okay, Mom,
I guess I'll see you at the wedding.

310
00:19:15,859 --> 00:19:17,861
Charlie, the wedding
isn't for six months.

311
00:19:18,028 --> 00:19:20,948
Yeah, but it's bad luck
to see the bride beforehand.

312
00:19:21,114 --> 00:19:24,701
Thanks again, fellas. You being a part
of this shindig means a lot to me.

313
00:19:24,868 --> 00:19:26,536
Our pleasure, Teddy. Bye-bye.

314
00:19:29,206 --> 00:19:31,875
Congratulations.
Once again, you get off scot-free.

315
00:19:32,042 --> 00:19:34,378
Free? You think that was free?

316
00:19:35,504 --> 00:19:37,130
- Charlie.
- Yeah, hey, hi.

317
00:19:37,297 --> 00:19:39,549
I wanted you to know
I'm not gonna say anything...

318
00:19:39,716 --> 00:19:41,802
about you and Courtney.
They don't get along.

319
00:19:41,969 --> 00:19:44,554
Okay, great. Wait, wait, wait.

320
00:19:44,721 --> 00:19:45,973
You knew? How did you know?

321
00:19:46,473 --> 00:19:49,309
I just noticed the car outside
with her dealer plates on it.

322
00:19:49,768 --> 00:19:52,479
You couldn't have noticed that
on the way in?

323
00:19:53,647 --> 00:19:56,483
- How much did she take you for?
- Don't ask.

324
00:19:56,650 --> 00:20:00,487
- Well, you can't say I didn't warn you.
- Wait, wait, wait.

325
00:20:00,654 --> 00:20:03,156
So you were trying to protect me?

326
00:20:03,573 --> 00:20:05,701
Hey, you're a good kid.

327
00:20:05,867 --> 00:20:10,998
And Courtney, well, I love her,
but she is kind of a sociopath.

328
00:20:11,623 --> 00:20:12,666
Bye now.

329
00:20:17,170 --> 00:20:19,423
- You know what this means, don't you?
- What?

330
00:20:19,589 --> 00:20:22,300
I'm gonna need an eight-car garage.
