1
00:00:13,210 --> 00:00:16,671
Oh, yeah. I am a finely tuned machine.

2
00:00:22,093 --> 00:00:24,471
- Hello.
- Are you a friend of Charlie's?

3
00:00:24,638 --> 00:00:26,014
I'm his brother.

4
00:00:26,181 --> 00:00:27,724
So, no.

5
00:00:28,808 --> 00:00:31,436
- I'm Gabrielle.
- Nice to meet you.

6
00:00:31,811 --> 00:00:33,104
I'm Alan.

7
00:00:33,271 --> 00:00:36,942
Or, as you would say, "Alan."

8
00:00:37,108 --> 00:00:38,985
Why would I say that?

9
00:00:39,402 --> 00:00:41,696
No reason. I'm a little dehydrated.

10
00:00:42,906 --> 00:00:45,951
- So you are a cyclist.
- A what?

11
00:00:46,701 --> 00:00:49,621
A cyclist? You know, with your bicycle.

12
00:00:50,997 --> 00:00:54,000
Yes, yes. I'm very passionate about...

13
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,461
"bicycling."

14
00:00:57,796 --> 00:01:01,633
I even have a stationary "cycle."

15
00:01:04,135 --> 00:01:06,680
I also jog and ab-crunch...

16
00:01:06,846 --> 00:01:11,726
and, of course, les buns of steel.

17
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:25,824
- Nice, huh?
- Nice? She's magnificent.

18
00:01:25,991 --> 00:01:29,411
- You should see her naked.
- Can I?

19
00:01:30,578 --> 00:01:32,414
Well, I could show you some pictures...

20
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:34,708
but you may not wanna see
that much of me.

21
00:01:36,376 --> 00:01:39,921
Just out of curiosity,
where do you find women like that?

22
00:01:40,088 --> 00:01:43,675
And, more importantly, how do you
get them to go to bed with you?

23
00:01:44,009 --> 00:01:47,470
- You really wanna know?
- Yeah. What's your secret?

24
00:01:47,637 --> 00:01:52,142
Well, you see, Alan, it's like this:

25
00:01:54,978 --> 00:01:56,855
I got a knack.

26
00:01:59,065 --> 00:02:02,861
- That's not a secret.
- Well, I didn't think so, but you asked.

27
00:02:03,319 --> 00:02:07,365
- So that's it? You've got a knack?
- Hey, everybody's good at something.

28
00:02:07,532 --> 00:02:09,075
You, for instance...

29
00:02:13,288 --> 00:02:14,414
have no shame.

30
00:02:15,915 --> 00:02:18,877
Excuse me, this is what they wear
in the Tour de France.

31
00:02:19,669 --> 00:02:22,714
Alan, I just took a Tour de France.

32
00:02:25,717 --> 00:02:28,386
And the only thing I was wearing
was a smile and a condom.

33
00:02:41,309 --> 00:02:43,978
- Hi, Judith. Hey, buddy.
- Hey.

34
00:02:44,479 --> 00:02:46,063
What's the matter with him?

35
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:48,774
- His little girlfriend broke up with him.
- Oh, no.

36
00:02:48,941 --> 00:02:52,069
Yeah. I was hoping you could
talk to him, because, let's face it...

37
00:02:52,236 --> 00:02:54,155
who knows more
about getting dumped?

38
00:02:57,325 --> 00:02:59,869
- Don't flatter me, Judith. I'll talk to him.
- I'm sorry.

39
00:03:00,036 --> 00:03:03,331
- That didn't come out the way I meant it.
- Really? How did you mean it?

40
00:03:03,498 --> 00:03:06,083
Couldn't you just take the "I'm sorry"?

41
00:03:06,876 --> 00:03:10,671
Couldn't you have just loved me?

42
00:03:13,424 --> 00:03:15,885
- Did I hear Numbnuts come in?
- Numbnuts?

43
00:03:16,052 --> 00:03:17,887
Sorry. Numbnuts Jr.

44
00:03:19,096 --> 00:03:22,558
- Lf you mean my son, yes, he's here.
- Crap.

45
00:03:25,937 --> 00:03:28,481
- What are you doing?
- Hiding my cookies.

46
00:03:29,315 --> 00:03:31,275
- Why?
- Because I just bought a new bag...

47
00:03:31,442 --> 00:03:34,195
and I don't want that knucklehead
to eat them all.

48
00:03:34,487 --> 00:03:37,698
Oh, Charlie. You hide your cookies
from a little boy who loves you?

49
00:03:37,865 --> 00:03:40,660
"Little boy," my ass.
He's a bottomless pit.

50
00:03:40,826 --> 00:03:45,206
And I'm tired of going for a snack and
having to lick cookie dust out of the bag.

51
00:03:45,539 --> 00:03:47,208
You might wanna take it easy on him.

52
00:03:47,375 --> 00:03:49,168
- He's going through a breakup.
- Really?

53
00:03:49,335 --> 00:03:50,419
Yeah.

54
00:04:03,557 --> 00:04:05,559
Nope. My cookies.

55
00:04:11,732 --> 00:04:16,195
- So how was school this week?
- Okay.

56
00:04:16,612 --> 00:04:19,699
- Anything noteworthy happen?
- No.

57
00:04:20,908 --> 00:04:22,368
Thought you said he got dumped.

58
00:04:30,751 --> 00:04:34,797
- I was easing into it.
- Oh, good idea. Go ahead.

59
00:04:36,132 --> 00:04:38,551
Jake, sooner or later,
every guy gets dumped.

60
00:04:39,218 --> 00:04:42,179
Some guys get dumped sooner and later,
right, Alan?

61
00:04:44,223 --> 00:04:46,475
Sorry. I should've eased into that.

62
00:04:47,935 --> 00:04:50,479
My point is, you've got nothing
to be embarrassed about.

63
00:04:50,646 --> 00:04:53,441
I'm not embarrassed. I'm angry.
She didn't even tell me why.

64
00:04:53,607 --> 00:04:57,028
She just sent me an e-mail saying she
doesn't wanna go out with me anymore.

65
00:04:57,194 --> 00:04:58,654
Maybe she found somebody better.

66
00:04:58,821 --> 00:05:01,824
What do you mean, better?
Who's better than Jake?

67
00:05:04,285 --> 00:05:06,078
Why, no one, Alan.

68
00:05:07,663 --> 00:05:10,416
He's the pinnacle of male evolution.

69
00:05:11,417 --> 00:05:12,460
Thank you.

70
00:05:14,795 --> 00:05:16,672
Look, buddy,
I know exactly how you feel.

71
00:05:16,839 --> 00:05:19,175
When I was your age,
I was dating a beautiful girl:

72
00:05:19,341 --> 00:05:22,803
Charity Kirschenbaum.
I was crazy about her.

73
00:05:22,970 --> 00:05:26,223
Then, the night before junior prom,
she called and dumped me.

74
00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:28,684
Wouldn't even give me a reason.
I was devastated.

75
00:05:28,851 --> 00:05:31,479
- So, what'd you do?
- What could I do?

76
00:05:31,645 --> 00:05:33,272
How can you mend a broken heart?

77
00:05:33,439 --> 00:05:36,984
How can you stop the rain
From falling down?

78
00:05:41,155 --> 00:05:44,700
- You done?
- Unless you wanna hear "Jive Talkin'."

79
00:05:48,829 --> 00:05:50,122
The thing is, Jake...

80
00:05:50,289 --> 00:05:53,584
that no matter how bad you feel now,
eventually, it'll pass.

81
00:05:53,751 --> 00:05:56,212
You just have to be willing
to live with the pain.

82
00:05:56,378 --> 00:05:58,422
- No, he doesn't.
- Yes, he does.

83
00:05:58,589 --> 00:06:01,008
Hang on, Dad.
What do you mean, no, I don't?

84
00:06:01,175 --> 00:06:04,178
When you get dumped, don't
sit around feeling sorry for yourself.

85
00:06:04,345 --> 00:06:07,056
You go out and find another girl,
a better girl.

86
00:06:07,556 --> 00:06:09,517
Okay, but how am I
gonna get another girl?

87
00:06:09,683 --> 00:06:11,852
I don't know how I got this one.

88
00:06:12,019 --> 00:06:13,854
You don't know
how you got a girlfriend?

89
00:06:14,021 --> 00:06:15,564
No, it just kind of happened.

90
00:06:15,731 --> 00:06:17,066
Yeah, I know how that goes.

91
00:06:18,776 --> 00:06:22,571
Wake up in the morning, and there
she is. Shut up. I know that was wrong.

92
00:06:23,822 --> 00:06:27,076
Look, Jake,
who is the cutest girl in your class?

93
00:06:27,243 --> 00:06:29,620
- Nicole O'Malley.
- Okay, call Nicole O'Malley...

94
00:06:29,787 --> 00:06:32,289
and ask her out.
- You drunk?

95
00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:34,416
A little.

96
00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:41,632
But this is a secret that will
serve you for the rest of your life:

97
00:06:41,799 --> 00:06:43,926
The hotter the girl, the Ionelier she is...

98
00:06:44,093 --> 00:06:46,428
because most guys
are too scared to talk to her.

99
00:06:46,595 --> 00:06:48,097
- Really?
- Really?

100
00:06:48,681 --> 00:06:50,599
Trust me.

101
00:06:53,394 --> 00:06:55,729
Why couldn't you have said this
20 years ago?

102
00:06:55,896 --> 00:06:58,732
Come on, Dad.
I wasn't even born 20 years ago.

103
00:06:59,233 --> 00:07:03,112
I really shouldn't be giving him advice
that could help him reproduce, should I?

104
00:07:18,419 --> 00:07:20,963
Oh, it's just you.

105
00:07:21,130 --> 00:07:22,840
Hey.

106
00:07:24,925 --> 00:07:26,260
What are you doing?

107
00:07:26,427 --> 00:07:32,558
I am drinking some of your finest Scotch
and looking at my high-school yearbook.

108
00:07:33,225 --> 00:07:35,269
Charity Kirschenbaum.

109
00:07:35,436 --> 00:07:38,981
I can't help wondering
how my life would've turned out...

110
00:07:39,148 --> 00:07:41,108
if she hadn't dumped me.

111
00:07:41,275 --> 00:07:43,068
Come on, your life turned out great.

112
00:07:45,946 --> 00:07:48,407
Well, it wouldn't have turned out
any better.

113
00:07:48,782 --> 00:07:50,200
You know what?

114
00:07:50,367 --> 00:07:54,663
I'm gonna call her
and find out why she broke my heart.

115
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:55,956
Good thinking.

116
00:07:56,123 --> 00:07:58,959
Call your high-school girlfriend drunk
at 2 in the morning.

117
00:07:59,126 --> 00:08:03,297
While you're at it, why don't you expose
yourself to an undercover policewoman?

118
00:08:03,714 --> 00:08:05,716
Some people do that.

119
00:08:06,091 --> 00:08:10,179
I need closure. I need to understand
why she dumped me.

120
00:08:12,014 --> 00:08:13,223
What's to understand?

121
00:08:15,976 --> 00:08:17,770
This is her.

122
00:08:19,354 --> 00:08:20,689
This is you.

123
00:08:22,608 --> 00:08:25,069
Peaches-and-cream complexion.

124
00:08:25,694 --> 00:08:27,112
You.

125
00:08:28,572 --> 00:08:30,407
Cheerleader.

126
00:08:30,657 --> 00:08:31,700
You.

127
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:35,454
Stop me any time.

128
00:08:35,621 --> 00:08:38,957
I don't care. I got her number
off the Internet, and I'm calling her.

129
00:08:39,124 --> 00:08:40,751
Oh, man.

130
00:08:40,918 --> 00:08:43,879
When are they gonna invent a phone
with a Breathalyzer lock?

131
00:08:44,505 --> 00:08:46,173
It's ringing.

132
00:08:47,049 --> 00:08:48,383
Hello?

133
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:50,469
Hello? Is this Charity?

134
00:08:52,012 --> 00:08:54,640
Hi, Charity. This is Alan Harper.

135
00:08:55,432 --> 00:08:58,018
Yeah, yeah, from high school.

136
00:08:58,185 --> 00:08:59,978
Anyway...

137
00:09:00,938 --> 00:09:03,065
Yeah, I know it's late.

138
00:09:03,357 --> 00:09:05,484
Yeah, I know I'm drunk.

139
00:09:05,651 --> 00:09:08,904
Listen, I just need to ask you
one question.

140
00:09:09,363 --> 00:09:12,074
Why did you dump me
on the night before junior prom?

141
00:09:16,954 --> 00:09:19,122
Okay. Okay.

142
00:09:19,289 --> 00:09:22,209
Okay, thanks. Go back to sleep.

143
00:09:23,794 --> 00:09:28,173
She said, to ask my brother, Cha...

144
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:33,053
- rlie.

145
00:09:43,814 --> 00:09:45,691
Oh, that's why.

146
00:09:54,676 --> 00:09:55,886
Morning.

147
00:09:56,052 --> 00:09:57,596
Morning.

148
00:10:01,558 --> 00:10:03,059
You found the stash, huh?

149
00:10:03,393 --> 00:10:04,853
Wasn't well-hidden.

150
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:07,272
Okay, just for the record,
that stuff's medicinal.

151
00:10:07,439 --> 00:10:09,190
I've got glaucoma.

152
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:13,028
- What are you talking about?
- Nothing.

153
00:10:17,449 --> 00:10:19,451
- Morning.
- Morning.

154
00:10:19,868 --> 00:10:22,454
- So where'd you disappear to last night?
- Me?

155
00:10:22,621 --> 00:10:24,247
I decided to take a little drive...

156
00:10:24,414 --> 00:10:27,709
give you a chance to calm down
about Charity Kirschenbaum.

157
00:10:28,293 --> 00:10:30,086
- I'm perfectly calm.
- Good.

158
00:10:30,253 --> 00:10:32,505
Who's Charity Kirschenbaum?

159
00:10:32,672 --> 00:10:36,259
It's just a little thing that's
not worth getting upset about, and...

160
00:10:36,426 --> 00:10:38,887
Hey, what the hell are you doing
with my cookies?

161
00:10:39,429 --> 00:10:41,723
- They're yours?
- You know they're mine.

162
00:10:41,890 --> 00:10:47,604
Oh, so you're saying I took something
that belonged to you, and you're upset?

163
00:10:52,275 --> 00:10:53,735
Oh, come on, Alan.

164
00:10:54,319 --> 00:10:57,781
I loved Charity Kirschenbaum, and
you stole her right out from under me.

165
00:10:57,989 --> 00:11:00,533
He's speaking metaphorically, right?

166
00:11:01,451 --> 00:11:03,453
Yeah. He was never on top of that.

167
00:11:05,121 --> 00:11:10,460
- I would've been, if it weren't for you.
- Okay, fine. I took your girl 20 years ago.

168
00:11:10,627 --> 00:11:14,798
That calls for maybe five, six cookies,
tops, not the whole damn bag.

169
00:11:14,964 --> 00:11:17,300
I had to go to junior prom
with cousin Phoebe.

170
00:11:18,009 --> 00:11:21,179
- She was cute.
- She was 12 and in a body cast.

171
00:11:21,346 --> 00:11:23,264
Well, so what? She was your cousin.

172
00:11:23,431 --> 00:11:25,684
She could've been 18
and in a cellophane bikini...

173
00:11:25,850 --> 00:11:27,936
and you weren't gonna get any.

174
00:11:28,770 --> 00:11:32,148
You are a horrible human being,
and I hope you burn in hell.

175
00:11:33,858 --> 00:11:38,154
- So we're good?
- No! We're not good!

176
00:11:38,321 --> 00:11:40,657
We suck!

177
00:11:42,409 --> 00:11:44,786
- Freshen that up for you?
- Thanks.

178
00:11:44,953 --> 00:11:48,665
You betrayed me!

179
00:11:48,998 --> 00:11:52,544
I hate you!

180
00:11:52,836 --> 00:11:55,964
I hate you! I hate you!

181
00:11:56,131 --> 00:12:00,135
I hate you!

182
00:12:01,344 --> 00:12:03,930
Sounds like he's going for a bike ride.

183
00:12:07,225 --> 00:12:09,394
Hello? Nicole O'Malley?

184
00:12:09,561 --> 00:12:11,146
Jake Harper here.

185
00:12:11,312 --> 00:12:15,108
Harper. I sit next to you
in geometry class.

186
00:12:15,275 --> 00:12:16,860
No, the other side.

187
00:12:17,026 --> 00:12:18,653
Yeah, with the big head.

188
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:23,950
I was wondering if you would go
to the winter dance with me.

189
00:12:24,576 --> 00:12:27,745
Really? Are you sure?

190
00:12:27,912 --> 00:12:32,083
Well, great.
I guess I'll see you at school. Bye.

191
00:12:33,001 --> 00:12:36,171
- Uncle Charlie's a genius.
- In a sense.

192
00:12:37,046 --> 00:12:40,175
But there's book smart and "look smart."

193
00:12:43,344 --> 00:12:45,722
- Would you get that, Berta?
- What?

194
00:12:45,889 --> 00:12:49,142
- The door.
- I can't hear you.

195
00:12:49,309 --> 00:12:52,854
- I said, would you get the door?
- I can't. I'm upstairs.

196
00:12:58,985 --> 00:13:00,862
Hi, Judith. Jake, your mom's here.

197
00:13:01,404 --> 00:13:03,531
- Did you talk to him?
- I did.

198
00:13:03,698 --> 00:13:05,617
- Hey, Mom.
- Hey, honey. How's it going?

199
00:13:05,783 --> 00:13:09,787
- Great. Uncle Charlie's a genius.
- Good, good.

200
00:13:10,163 --> 00:13:12,207
- You said you talked to him.
- I did.

201
00:13:12,373 --> 00:13:16,044
- Then why is Uncle Charlie a genius?
- Because he never got married.

202
00:13:19,339 --> 00:13:22,759
Oh, that's gonna come back
to bite me in the ass.

203
00:13:25,094 --> 00:13:28,598
And here it comes, jaws a-snapping.

204
00:13:29,682 --> 00:13:32,226
All right, I'm sorry.

205
00:13:33,645 --> 00:13:35,063
Why are you sorry?

206
00:13:36,272 --> 00:13:38,566
I just find it's easier that way.

207
00:13:39,442 --> 00:13:41,653
Okay. Is Charlie at home?

208
00:13:41,819 --> 00:13:44,322
Oh, no.
He went out a couple of hours ago.

209
00:13:45,114 --> 00:13:48,076
I've been trying to call him on his cell,
but he doesn't answer.

210
00:13:48,242 --> 00:13:50,954
- Well, please tell him I stopped by.
- Sure thing.

211
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:54,290
Gabrielle?

212
00:13:56,250 --> 00:13:57,752
Forgive me if I'm out of line...

213
00:13:57,919 --> 00:14:03,299
but I sense a Ioneliness inside you.

214
00:14:05,426 --> 00:14:08,805
- Is it so obvious?
- I'm right?

215
00:14:08,972 --> 00:14:11,849
Oh, yes. But how could you know?

216
00:14:12,892 --> 00:14:14,394
We're two of a kind.

217
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:20,525
I myself have tasted
the saltiness of Ionely tears.

218
00:14:22,568 --> 00:14:25,613
- We have much to share.
- We do indeed. Come on in.

219
00:14:27,532 --> 00:14:30,785
First his cookies, now his croissant.

220
00:14:33,830 --> 00:14:38,876
Well, in my experience, I've found that
the more beautiful the woman is...

221
00:14:39,043 --> 00:14:40,294
the Ionelier she is.

222
00:14:40,461 --> 00:14:43,965
That's very true. How do you
know so much about women?

223
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:46,843
What can I say? I have a knack.

224
00:14:49,679 --> 00:14:52,682
- Hey.
- Oh, hello, Charlie.

225
00:14:52,849 --> 00:14:54,642
Gee, how embarrassing.

226
00:14:55,518 --> 00:14:58,896
- What are you talking about?
- Oh, dear. This is so difficult.

227
00:14:59,063 --> 00:15:01,357
No, it's not. Go ahead, tell him. Tell him.

228
00:15:01,941 --> 00:15:08,197
Charlie, you're a wonderful man, but
your brother, he really understands me.

229
00:15:08,865 --> 00:15:10,408
So, what are you saying?

230
00:15:11,826 --> 00:15:13,494
It's just...

231
00:15:13,870 --> 00:15:15,538
l...

232
00:15:16,289 --> 00:15:19,375
- I can't.
- I can. She's dumping you for me.

233
00:15:20,168 --> 00:15:22,879
This is so awkward. I must go.

234
00:15:23,045 --> 00:15:25,715
Please forgive me?

235
00:15:31,929 --> 00:15:33,097
How does it feel?

236
00:15:33,931 --> 00:15:36,058
- I'm stunned.
- Good, good. What else?

237
00:15:36,559 --> 00:15:38,519
- You snaked my girlfriend?
- Yes, I did.

238
00:15:38,686 --> 00:15:41,105
I snaked her. Like a cobra.

239
00:15:43,024 --> 00:15:46,903
- And you did it just to hurt me?
- Well, not just to hurt you.

240
00:15:47,069 --> 00:15:48,946
Well, yeah, just to hurt you.

241
00:15:50,239 --> 00:15:52,283
I don't know what to say.

242
00:15:52,575 --> 00:15:56,537
- I'm crushed.
- That's good. Say that. "I'm crushed."

243
00:15:57,580 --> 00:16:00,875
My own brother
purposefully set out to hurt me.

244
00:16:02,376 --> 00:16:04,962
Oh, no. Oh, no.
You're not taking this away from me.

245
00:16:05,129 --> 00:16:07,506
What about you
and Charity Kirschenbaum?

246
00:16:07,673 --> 00:16:12,386
I was 17, Alan. I was a horny idiot.
But you, you're an adult.

247
00:16:12,553 --> 00:16:15,556
Okay. I see where you're going,
and it's not gonna work.

248
00:16:15,723 --> 00:16:17,934
You're not taking this away from me.

249
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:21,938
I really thought our relationship
had grown beyond this petty crap.

250
00:16:22,104 --> 00:16:24,232
I thought I could count on you.

251
00:16:24,398 --> 00:16:25,942
I thought you were my friend.

252
00:16:30,863 --> 00:16:33,407
Son of a bitch. He took it away from me.

253
00:16:45,628 --> 00:16:47,421
Oh, hey. You're here.

254
00:16:48,047 --> 00:16:49,590
Where am I gonna go, Alan?

255
00:16:51,801 --> 00:16:55,012
- You took my girl.
- And I feel awful about that.

256
00:16:56,722 --> 00:17:00,267
- It doesn't matter.
- It does matter. I made a terrible mistake.

257
00:17:00,434 --> 00:17:03,145
I did the worst thing I could possibly do.

258
00:17:03,813 --> 00:17:05,815
I lowered myself to your level.

259
00:17:07,775 --> 00:17:10,152
You know what I mean.
I love you. You're my brother.

260
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:13,656
- I wouldn't hurt you for the world.
- Actions speak louder than words.

261
00:17:13,823 --> 00:17:16,701
You're right. Okay. Here's an action.

262
00:17:21,122 --> 00:17:23,332
You bought me a bag of cookies.

263
00:17:23,499 --> 00:17:25,793
Sure, that should make up
for stealing Gabrielle.

264
00:17:28,254 --> 00:17:30,715
How about three bags?

265
00:17:32,008 --> 00:17:34,719
And I'm breaking it off with her.
You can have her back.

266
00:17:34,885 --> 00:17:36,512
Have her back?

267
00:17:36,679 --> 00:17:39,473
What is wrong with you?
She's not a lawn mower you borrowed.

268
00:17:41,058 --> 00:17:44,520
You can't just hose off the blades
and give her back.

269
00:17:45,604 --> 00:17:48,357
- But... But...
- "But" nothing.

270
00:17:48,524 --> 00:17:52,111
She dumped me because she likes you.
So, what are you gonna say to her, Alan?

271
00:17:52,278 --> 00:17:56,198
"I was just using you to punish Charlie
for something that happened"?

272
00:17:56,365 --> 00:17:59,326
I probably wouldn't use those words.

273
00:17:59,493 --> 00:18:03,539
You can't ease your conscience
about hurting me by hurting her.

274
00:18:03,706 --> 00:18:06,542
So you're saying
you want me to keep seeing her?

275
00:18:06,709 --> 00:18:09,545
I'm saying
I want you to do the right thing.

276
00:18:09,712 --> 00:18:13,048
- And then you'll forgive me?
- Yes, then I'll forgive you.

277
00:18:15,134 --> 00:18:18,095
Well, okay.

278
00:18:18,554 --> 00:18:23,267
For you,
I'll keep seeing the gorgeous woman.

279
00:18:24,518 --> 00:18:25,561
Thank you.

280
00:18:26,687 --> 00:18:28,355
You're welcome.

281
00:18:33,277 --> 00:18:36,989
- Okay, so, what's the catch?
- Catch?

282
00:18:37,323 --> 00:18:39,867
I don't know what you're talking about.

283
00:18:42,661 --> 00:18:45,623
So are you sure
everything's okay with Charlie?

284
00:18:45,789 --> 00:18:49,502
Everything's great with Charlie.
Charlie's fine. Forget Charlie.

285
00:18:52,922 --> 00:18:55,090
Well, you know, like the song:

286
00:19:07,978 --> 00:19:09,855
Okay.

287
00:19:10,606 --> 00:19:11,649
I'm ready.

288
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:16,612
- Excuse me?
- Go ahead.

289
00:19:16,779 --> 00:19:18,822
Get it over with.

290
00:19:19,532 --> 00:19:22,785
- I'm not sure I follow.
- Do what you have to do.

291
00:19:22,952 --> 00:19:25,412
Just hurry.

292
00:19:26,247 --> 00:19:28,958
But don't you wanna start
with some kissing...

293
00:19:29,124 --> 00:19:31,460
and, you know, foreplay?

294
00:19:32,002 --> 00:19:33,963
No, thank you.

295
00:19:35,172 --> 00:19:37,299
How about a smile?

296
00:19:41,971 --> 00:19:43,889
Better?

297
00:19:44,056 --> 00:19:46,183
Actually, worse.

298
00:19:46,809 --> 00:19:49,436
Could you close your eyes again?

299
00:20:02,116 --> 00:20:04,702
- Where are you going?
- I have to brush my teeth.

300
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:06,453
The bathroom's that way.

301
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:09,290
Yeah, but my toothbrush is at home.
Bye-bye.

302
00:20:18,833 --> 00:20:21,211
- Hey.
- Hey.

303
00:20:21,753 --> 00:20:23,922
How'd it go with Gabrielle?

304
00:20:24,255 --> 00:20:27,467
- I think you know how it went.
- Yeah, I do.

305
00:20:29,344 --> 00:20:31,554
It's kind of like necrophilia, isn't it?

306
00:20:31,721 --> 00:20:34,599
- I didn't go through with it.
- Really?

307
00:20:34,766 --> 00:20:37,101
I guess we're different that way.

308
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:43,399
So I didn't really
steal her from you, did I?

309
00:20:44,025 --> 00:20:47,320
- Nope.
- You were trying to get rid of her.

310
00:20:47,487 --> 00:20:52,492
Yep. But I didn't wanna hurt her feelings.
Thanks for helping me out with that.

311
00:20:53,618 --> 00:20:56,829
Well, at least now we're even, right?

312
00:20:58,248 --> 00:20:59,874
- Not quite.
- What do you mean?

313
00:21:00,041 --> 00:21:03,419
Charlie. Coming back to bed?

314
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:08,675
- Charity? Charity Kirschenbaum?
- Oh, hi, Alan. Long time no see.

315
00:21:08,841 --> 00:21:11,344
Yeah, 20 years.

316
00:21:11,511 --> 00:21:13,888
She looks great, doesn't she?

317
00:21:14,055 --> 00:21:15,807
- Come on, baby.
- But...

318
00:21:15,974 --> 00:21:18,601
Now we're even.

319
00:21:24,941 --> 00:21:31,698
I hate you!
