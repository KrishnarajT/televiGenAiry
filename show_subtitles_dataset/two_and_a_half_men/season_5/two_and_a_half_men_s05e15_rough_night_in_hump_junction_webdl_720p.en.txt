1
00:00:01,465 --> 00:00:04,384
- Alan, I need to talk to you.
- Okay.

2
00:00:04,551 --> 00:00:07,471
- Alone.
- Gotta be about sex.

3
00:00:08,513 --> 00:00:09,556
Take a hike.

4
00:00:09,723 --> 00:00:11,975
I'm 14.
You're not protecting me anymore.

5
00:00:12,142 --> 00:00:14,561
- Jake.
- This is just a pathetic sham.

6
00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:20,609
- So, what's up?
- Okay, long story short.

7
00:00:20,776 --> 00:00:25,072
- I've got a young woman upstairs.
- Wow, I didn't see this one coming.

8
00:00:25,906 --> 00:00:28,033
See her?
I'm surprised you couldn't hear her.

9
00:00:29,242 --> 00:00:31,370
She was like a cat in a fan belt.

10
00:00:33,747 --> 00:00:38,001
Anyway, I need you to entertain her
in my absence.

11
00:00:38,168 --> 00:00:40,045
Entertain her?
What did you have in mind?

12
00:00:40,212 --> 00:00:42,339
A musical number
from Sweeney Todd?

13
00:00:43,173 --> 00:00:45,717
How young is she?
Maybe a little peekaboo.

14
00:00:47,427 --> 00:00:50,222
Right there.
That's why no one likes you.

15
00:00:51,848 --> 00:00:53,683
Just keep her occupied till I get back.

16
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:56,478
- Where are you going?
- I have a date.

17
00:00:56,895 --> 00:00:59,564
A date? It's 8:30 in the morning.

18
00:00:59,731 --> 00:01:02,859
I know what time it is. I have
a limited window of opportunity here.

19
00:01:03,026 --> 00:01:05,278
Her husband's playing nine holes,
so I thought...

20
00:01:05,445 --> 00:01:08,115
I'd try and play a couple myself.

21
00:01:08,865 --> 00:01:11,118
Then why don't you
just send the other girl home?

22
00:01:11,868 --> 00:01:15,205
I'll be back by noon. What am I
supposed to do the rest of the day?

23
00:01:16,414 --> 00:01:18,083
Okay, okay.

24
00:01:18,875 --> 00:01:22,212
I'm gonna say something now, because,
well, I think it needs to be said.

25
00:01:22,379 --> 00:01:25,423
- What?
- You're a severely damaged human being.

26
00:01:26,758 --> 00:01:28,885
Hey, I'd love to stay
and chitchat with you...

27
00:01:29,052 --> 00:01:31,471
but I've got a golf widow
marinating in Brentwood.

28
00:01:31,638 --> 00:01:34,266
Wait, wait. What am I
supposed to tell the girl upstairs?

29
00:01:34,432 --> 00:01:36,935
I don't know.
Tell her I went out to give blood.

30
00:01:37,102 --> 00:01:40,147
That way, if I come back a little weak,
I've got a good excuse.

31
00:01:42,232 --> 00:01:43,817
So you want me to just lie to her?

32
00:01:43,984 --> 00:01:46,152
It's up to you.
You could tell her the truth.

33
00:01:46,319 --> 00:01:50,073
But then you'd have to pack up all your
crap and move into the lifeguard station.

34
00:01:51,408 --> 00:01:52,576
Why do you gotta do that?

35
00:01:52,742 --> 00:01:54,619
Why is it always
"my way or the highway"?

36
00:01:54,786 --> 00:01:56,788
"Obey my commands or you're out."

37
00:01:56,955 --> 00:01:59,666
Then again, if the system works,
why mess with it?

38
00:02:27,402 --> 00:02:32,282
Boy, they left the faucet on a long time
when they poured those legs.

39
00:02:33,325 --> 00:02:36,328
I don't believe it. Another one.

40
00:02:38,997 --> 00:02:40,165
Oh, hey, Alan.

41
00:02:40,332 --> 00:02:42,417
- Who's the blond?
- Don't know.

42
00:02:42,584 --> 00:02:43,918
Found her on the beach.

43
00:02:44,753 --> 00:02:46,004
Like homeless?

44
00:02:46,713 --> 00:02:48,673
Not tonight.

45
00:02:48,923 --> 00:02:50,759
You realize that's three in one day.

46
00:02:51,301 --> 00:02:55,096
Depends how you count.
I make it out to be seven.

47
00:02:56,514 --> 00:02:57,974
Or eight.

48
00:02:58,141 --> 00:02:59,934
I should carry a clicker.

49
00:03:02,103 --> 00:03:04,898
Oh, Charlie, even for you,
this is ridiculous.

50
00:03:05,065 --> 00:03:09,402
Hey, one man's ridiculous
is another man's "yabba dabba doo."

51
00:03:11,946 --> 00:03:13,990
"I should carry a clicker."

52
00:03:16,785 --> 00:03:18,828
By the way, I'm Charlie.

53
00:03:19,162 --> 00:03:21,956
- I'm Gretchen.
- I like that. Gretchen.

54
00:03:22,123 --> 00:03:23,416
It's got a built-in:

55
00:03:27,253 --> 00:03:28,963
Upstairs on the right.

56
00:03:29,130 --> 00:03:31,299
- Make yourself comfortable.
- Okay.

57
00:03:39,474 --> 00:03:41,226
- Charlie Harper?
- Yeah?

58
00:03:43,269 --> 00:03:45,772
Keep your hands off my wife.

59
00:03:46,064 --> 00:03:47,816
Yes, sir. No problem.

60
00:03:48,483 --> 00:03:50,777
God, Charlie, are you okay?

61
00:03:51,486 --> 00:03:55,740
No, I'm not okay.
I just got punched in the face.

62
00:03:56,991 --> 00:03:58,827
Help me up.

63
00:03:59,452 --> 00:04:01,579
That was an angry husband, wasn't it?

64
00:04:01,746 --> 00:04:03,456
Well, you can't really blame him.

65
00:04:03,623 --> 00:04:06,793
From now on, he's gonna have to
take his wife golfing with him.

66
00:04:09,921 --> 00:04:12,632
Wait a second.
You're still going upstairs?

67
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:15,635
Why not? It wasn't her husband.

68
00:04:17,595 --> 00:04:19,264
But you're bleeding.

69
00:04:20,306 --> 00:04:22,225
Did you see that girl?

70
00:04:22,392 --> 00:04:25,311
I'd be climbing these stairs
if I was just a head and a spine.

71
00:04:30,358 --> 00:04:33,319
Berta, have you noticed anything
different about Charlie lately?

72
00:04:33,486 --> 00:04:36,239
- What did you mean?
- Well, he's always been promiscuous...

73
00:04:36,406 --> 00:04:39,284
but I'm starting to think
I should hide my bowling ball.

74
00:04:40,451 --> 00:04:41,828
I know what you're saying.

75
00:04:41,995 --> 00:04:43,913
I'm having to change
his sheets so often...

76
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:46,249
I'm thinking about
putting them on a roller.

77
00:04:49,544 --> 00:04:51,337
Have you seen him
act this way before?

78
00:04:51,504 --> 00:04:55,800
Well, when Viagra first came out,
I thought he was gonna die.

79
00:04:58,011 --> 00:05:01,139
Know how they say if your erection
lasts for more than four hours...

80
00:05:01,306 --> 00:05:02,765
you should call your doctor?

81
00:05:02,932 --> 00:05:04,309
He'd just call another girl.

82
00:05:06,477 --> 00:05:10,148
For a while there, he had to
stand on his head to take a leak.

83
00:05:18,781 --> 00:05:20,742
- Morning.
- Morning.

84
00:05:24,704 --> 00:05:27,081
Rough night in Hump Junction?

85
00:05:28,374 --> 00:05:30,251
No, it was good.

86
00:05:31,044 --> 00:05:32,378
I just had a little accident.

87
00:05:34,339 --> 00:05:37,759
I tried to pick my lady friend up
and put her on the bureau...

88
00:05:37,926 --> 00:05:42,347
and now
I can't find one of my testicles.

89
00:05:43,514 --> 00:05:44,766
Oh, Charlie.

90
00:05:46,017 --> 00:05:48,269
I don't think I really lost it.

91
00:05:48,895 --> 00:05:50,521
It's kind of like your keys.

92
00:05:50,688 --> 00:05:52,690
Even if you can't
put your hands on them...

93
00:05:52,857 --> 00:05:54,776
you know they gotta
be somewhere.

94
00:05:59,572 --> 00:06:03,117
That is something you do not
wanna find in the vacuum bag.

95
00:06:06,954 --> 00:06:09,248
You know,
I'm really starting to worry about him.

96
00:06:09,415 --> 00:06:11,334
I feel like I should do something.

97
00:06:11,501 --> 00:06:13,461
The way he's been acting,
if I were you...

98
00:06:13,628 --> 00:06:16,964
I'd start sleeping on my back
wearing a catcher's mask.

99
00:06:19,217 --> 00:06:21,928
Good news. I found it.

100
00:06:24,555 --> 00:06:26,557
It's always the last place you look.

101
00:06:32,605 --> 00:06:35,316
- You sure you're up for this?
- I'm fine.

102
00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:45,243
Just a little tender in the giblets.

103
00:06:52,875 --> 00:06:54,752
Yeah, you're fine.

104
00:06:56,295 --> 00:06:58,047
Two beers, please.

105
00:07:00,007 --> 00:07:02,135
Oh, yeah, much better.

106
00:07:09,183 --> 00:07:11,477
- What are you doing?
- What do you think I'm doing?

107
00:07:11,644 --> 00:07:13,020
Scouting the talent.

108
00:07:13,855 --> 00:07:15,982
Are you out of your mind?

109
00:07:16,149 --> 00:07:17,316
What's your pickup line?

110
00:07:17,483 --> 00:07:20,862
"Wanna come back to my place
and help me look for my balls?"

111
00:07:21,028 --> 00:07:23,531
It was one ball, and I found it.

112
00:07:24,866 --> 00:07:27,994
Charlie, don't you think
you need to slow down a bit?

113
00:07:28,161 --> 00:07:29,370
Why would I wanna do that?

114
00:07:29,537 --> 00:07:30,663
Oh, come on.

115
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:33,708
Is this lifestyle
actually making you happy?

116
00:07:34,667 --> 00:07:36,919
Let me answer that question
with another question.

117
00:07:37,086 --> 00:07:39,463
Who would you rather be? You or me?

118
00:07:40,131 --> 00:07:41,632
You're kidding, right?

119
00:07:41,799 --> 00:07:45,052
You have two black eyes
and you're perched on a scrotum cozy.

120
00:07:47,597 --> 00:07:49,223
You.

121
00:07:54,103 --> 00:07:55,563
- Hi.
- Hey there.

122
00:07:55,730 --> 00:07:57,815
Oh, sweet Lord.

123
00:07:57,982 --> 00:07:59,692
Can I buy you a drink?

124
00:08:00,276 --> 00:08:01,861
If you want to.

125
00:08:02,028 --> 00:08:05,823
Well, I'd like to buy you an airplane,
but let's start with the drink.

126
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:07,825
- I'm Charlie.
- Pepper.

127
00:08:07,992 --> 00:08:09,493
Oh, my favorite condiment.

128
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:12,330
- It's a spice.
- Shut up.

129
00:08:13,331 --> 00:08:15,708
So, Charlie...

130
00:08:20,713 --> 00:08:22,340
No kidding.

131
00:08:22,506 --> 00:08:24,133
Well, then...

132
00:08:28,596 --> 00:08:30,806
All right,
you're under arrest for solicitation.

133
00:08:30,973 --> 00:08:34,435
Stand up, put your hands behind
your back and spread your legs.

134
00:08:35,603 --> 00:08:38,439
I'm afraid
you're gonna have to choose one.

135
00:08:42,443 --> 00:08:44,236
Now will you admit
you've got a problem?

136
00:08:44,403 --> 00:08:46,948
Hey, that was entrapment.

137
00:08:47,198 --> 00:08:48,741
I'm the victim here.

138
00:08:48,908 --> 00:08:52,286
If she wasn't a cop, what did you think
you were gonna do with her?

139
00:08:53,913 --> 00:08:55,289
I really don't know.

140
00:08:55,456 --> 00:08:57,708
Charlie, don't you see
what's happening to you?

141
00:08:57,875 --> 00:09:02,797
Nothing's happening, except I offered
to buy a policewoman a $500 martini.

142
00:09:03,464 --> 00:09:06,092
Well, then there's no point
in my talking to you anymore.

143
00:09:06,258 --> 00:09:09,220
All right.
Then something good came of this.

144
00:09:25,319 --> 00:09:28,030
You stay away from my girlfriend.

145
00:09:28,197 --> 00:09:30,658
You're gonna have to be
more specific.

146
00:09:32,702 --> 00:09:35,162
Son of a bitch.

147
00:09:38,491 --> 00:09:41,286
So, Charlie, what's been going on?

148
00:09:45,832 --> 00:09:47,292
Well...

149
00:09:48,627 --> 00:09:50,211
I've got a new career.

150
00:09:50,837 --> 00:09:53,173
As a crash-test dummy?

151
00:09:55,508 --> 00:09:57,260
Writing songs for little kids.

152
00:09:57,427 --> 00:09:58,845
- Really?
- Yeah.

153
00:09:59,012 --> 00:10:02,223
Turns out immature minds
respond to me.

154
00:10:02,807 --> 00:10:04,726
Sounds about right.

155
00:10:06,686 --> 00:10:08,521
Let's see. What else?

156
00:10:08,688 --> 00:10:10,523
My mom's getting married. Nice guy.

157
00:10:10,690 --> 00:10:12,025
- Good for her.
- Yeah, yeah.

158
00:10:12,192 --> 00:10:14,235
- My brother still lives with me.
- Sure.

159
00:10:14,402 --> 00:10:16,488
We knew he wasn't
going anywhere.

160
00:10:19,032 --> 00:10:20,575
Let's see.

161
00:10:20,742 --> 00:10:22,702
My nephew's growing like a weed.

162
00:10:22,869 --> 00:10:26,164
My ex-fiancée's getting married.
I've been dating. Nothing serious.

163
00:10:26,331 --> 00:10:30,669
And as you can see,
I've had a couple of mishaps.

164
00:10:31,294 --> 00:10:34,506
Well, except for the facial lacerations
and the rectal doughnut...

165
00:10:34,673 --> 00:10:36,341
hardly noticeable.

166
00:10:37,050 --> 00:10:39,719
It's actually a testicular doughnut.

167
00:10:40,553 --> 00:10:43,348
- What's the difference?
- About that much.

168
00:10:46,101 --> 00:10:48,269
Well, that's disturbing.

169
00:10:50,438 --> 00:10:52,524
Let's circle back to the ex-fiancée.

170
00:10:52,691 --> 00:10:54,025
- What was her name?
- Mia.

171
00:10:54,401 --> 00:10:58,405
Mia. How do you feel about Mia getting
married and moving on with her life?

172
00:10:59,531 --> 00:11:01,491
I feel fine about it. I'm happy for her.

173
00:11:01,658 --> 00:11:04,077
No remorse, no regrets?

174
00:11:04,828 --> 00:11:06,913
Not really. It's been a long time.

175
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,331
Okay.

176
00:11:08,498 --> 00:11:11,126
So when did you learn
about her upcoming nuptials?

177
00:11:12,585 --> 00:11:16,089
I don't know. A couple of weeks ago.

178
00:11:17,757 --> 00:11:19,134
Yep, two weeks.

179
00:11:20,135 --> 00:11:22,720
You carry the announcement
around with you?

180
00:11:22,887 --> 00:11:25,265
- Yeah. Why?
- No reason.

181
00:11:26,808 --> 00:11:28,560
And you say you've been dating a lot.

182
00:11:29,018 --> 00:11:32,689
- A little more than usual.
- When did that new pattern start?

183
00:11:33,606 --> 00:11:36,443
Gee, I don't know.
It's gotta be a couple of weeks now.

184
00:11:40,363 --> 00:11:41,656
- What?
- Oh, come on, Charlie.

185
00:11:41,823 --> 00:11:45,285
Just because I get paid by the hour
doesn't mean this should take forever.

186
00:11:47,704 --> 00:11:50,790
It's pretty clear that the news
about this woman getting married...

187
00:11:50,957 --> 00:11:53,293
has hurt you, and you're acting out.

188
00:11:54,627 --> 00:11:58,339
Man, you shrinks wanna bring
everything back to feelings, don't you?

189
00:11:58,798 --> 00:12:01,634
Think it has anything to do
with your toilet training?

190
00:12:01,801 --> 00:12:04,554
- No.
- Then I guess we're stuck with feelings.

191
00:12:05,972 --> 00:12:09,142
Now, when you read that
announcement, how did you feel?

192
00:12:10,143 --> 00:12:13,813
I don't know. How you feel when the
woman you were once in love with...

193
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:17,400
is getting married to another guy.
- Describe it.

194
00:12:17,817 --> 00:12:20,069
- Describe it?
- Just for fun.

195
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:26,159
It's hard to say exactly.

196
00:12:26,993 --> 00:12:29,120
I guess it's kind of like...

197
00:12:29,287 --> 00:12:33,708
a trapdoor opens up
under your feet and you're falling.

198
00:12:33,875 --> 00:12:37,253
And at the same time, there's this
enormous pressure on your chest...

199
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:41,382
like a big animal,
maybe a possum or a raccoon...

200
00:12:41,549 --> 00:12:43,343
is sitting on it.

201
00:12:45,011 --> 00:12:46,721
And you can't catch your breath.

202
00:12:47,263 --> 00:12:49,933
Possum or a raccoon.

203
00:12:50,808 --> 00:12:53,853
- Lf you're writing it down, say raccoon.
- Will do.

204
00:12:54,854 --> 00:12:56,981
I don't know why I said possum.

205
00:12:58,066 --> 00:12:59,692
It's okay.

206
00:12:59,859 --> 00:13:03,363
Do you think it's possible
that this feeling of falling...

207
00:13:03,529 --> 00:13:07,241
and the raccoon on your chest
is a physical manifestation...

208
00:13:07,408 --> 00:13:09,035
of unexpressed grief?

209
00:13:09,535 --> 00:13:11,454
- Grief?
- You know, sadness.

210
00:13:11,621 --> 00:13:13,539
How do you read sadness into that?

211
00:13:14,165 --> 00:13:16,209
Look, Charlie, you're a smart guy.

212
00:13:16,376 --> 00:13:17,627
Emotionally:

213
00:13:19,671 --> 00:13:21,506
But you gotta see
what's going on here.

214
00:13:21,673 --> 00:13:25,635
You're using this series
of meaningless sexual liaisons...

215
00:13:25,802 --> 00:13:28,596
to run away from your feelings
about losing this woman.

216
00:13:30,139 --> 00:13:32,767
No, no, I'm sorry. I don't see it.

217
00:13:32,934 --> 00:13:34,143
Let's keep looking.

218
00:13:34,310 --> 00:13:37,313
What about my mom getting married?
That can upset a fella, right?

219
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:40,441
Make him go all ancient Greek
and poke his eyes out?

220
00:13:41,901 --> 00:13:43,986
Oh, come on, Charlie,
you loved this woman.

221
00:13:44,153 --> 00:13:45,863
And I'd say you still love her.

222
00:13:46,030 --> 00:13:49,492
And deep down, maybe you were hoping
someday you'd get back together.

223
00:13:49,659 --> 00:13:52,870
And the only reason you're not
sitting here weeping...

224
00:13:53,037 --> 00:13:55,373
is because it's too painful
for you.

225
00:13:58,626 --> 00:14:01,421
I'm sorry. I just can't see it.

226
00:14:01,587 --> 00:14:05,466
You can't see it
because your penis is in the way.

227
00:14:08,469 --> 00:14:09,887
Thank you.

228
00:14:11,681 --> 00:14:13,391
Not a compliment, Charlie.

229
00:14:14,225 --> 00:14:15,810
Says you.

230
00:14:18,521 --> 00:14:21,399
Look, you have
a very simple choice here.

231
00:14:21,566 --> 00:14:23,860
You can honestly
confront these emotions...

232
00:14:24,026 --> 00:14:26,112
and learn the lessons they bring...

233
00:14:26,279 --> 00:14:30,366
or you can drive yourself into
an early grave with indiscriminate sex.

234
00:14:34,287 --> 00:14:35,705
Define "early."

235
00:14:56,601 --> 00:14:57,727
What are you doing?

236
00:14:58,603 --> 00:15:00,938
I'm trying to feel my feelings.

237
00:15:03,566 --> 00:15:04,692
Really?

238
00:15:05,526 --> 00:15:08,112
- How's it going?
- Not well.

239
00:15:15,244 --> 00:15:17,205
See? Nothing, no grief.

240
00:15:17,371 --> 00:15:19,916
What exactly
are you trying to grieve over?

241
00:15:20,082 --> 00:15:22,126
Well, Mia's getting married...

242
00:15:22,293 --> 00:15:23,377
Wait, wait, wait. Mia?

243
00:15:23,544 --> 00:15:25,588
- The one you were gonna marry?
- Yeah.

244
00:15:25,755 --> 00:15:28,883
And my shrink thinks
I'm pretty upset about it.

245
00:15:29,550 --> 00:15:31,886
Do you think you're upset about it?

246
00:15:32,345 --> 00:15:33,554
I don't know.

247
00:15:33,930 --> 00:15:36,182
- I really did love her.
- I know you did.

248
00:15:36,349 --> 00:15:37,934
Yeah.

249
00:15:38,935 --> 00:15:40,436
I remember this one time...

250
00:15:40,603 --> 00:15:43,689
we were driving to
Santa Barbara for the weekend...

251
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:46,442
and she just smiled at me.

252
00:15:46,609 --> 00:15:47,735
And I thought:

253
00:15:47,902 --> 00:15:53,074
"Man, I could spend the rest of my life
with this woman, no problem."

254
00:15:54,325 --> 00:15:55,952
And then...

255
00:15:56,577 --> 00:15:59,497
Then I lost her.

256
00:15:59,664 --> 00:16:03,000
And I don't think
I'm gonna find anybody like her again.

257
00:16:03,167 --> 00:16:04,669
What the hell is going on, Alan?

258
00:16:05,711 --> 00:16:08,965
This is good. This is good.
You're finally starting to feel your grief.

259
00:16:09,131 --> 00:16:11,217
And once you really feel it
and accept it...

260
00:16:11,384 --> 00:16:13,594
you can get on with your life
without Mia.

261
00:16:13,761 --> 00:16:16,764
- Really?
- Yeah, yeah, go ahead. Let it out.

262
00:16:20,643 --> 00:16:22,436
No, this is crap.

263
00:16:25,898 --> 00:16:27,608
Where are you going?

264
00:16:27,817 --> 00:16:28,901
I just realized...

265
00:16:29,068 --> 00:16:32,905
I won't have to feel my feelings and
live without Mia if I just go get her back.

266
00:16:33,572 --> 00:16:36,409
- That's your solution?
- Yeah... right?

267
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:41,372
Indeed.

268
00:16:45,543 --> 00:16:47,670
Forgot my doughnut.

269
00:16:50,006 --> 00:16:51,757
You laugh, but it really does help.

270
00:16:56,721 --> 00:16:59,348
Bride? Seen the bride?

271
00:17:00,015 --> 00:17:02,935
- I got a delivery for the bride.
- I think she's in there.

272
00:17:03,102 --> 00:17:05,896
Thanks. Here you go.

273
00:17:11,110 --> 00:17:13,571
You look so beautiful.

274
00:17:14,196 --> 00:17:15,906
You are so lucky.

275
00:17:17,324 --> 00:17:19,452
- Hey.
- Charlie.

276
00:17:19,618 --> 00:17:20,786
What are you doing here?

277
00:17:21,203 --> 00:17:24,331
- I came to get you back.
- Are you out of your mind?

278
00:17:25,291 --> 00:17:27,251
No, no. I got the idea from my shrink.

279
00:17:29,462 --> 00:17:31,130
Could you ladies give us a minute?

280
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:35,968
- Okay. One minute.
- Thanks.

281
00:17:37,636 --> 00:17:39,930
How are you? Looking good.

282
00:17:40,097 --> 00:17:42,475
Don't worry, your big day will come.

283
00:17:45,269 --> 00:17:47,146
Charlie, I'm getting married in an hour.

284
00:17:47,688 --> 00:17:50,274
- So I'm not too late.
- Oh, you are so too late.

285
00:17:50,441 --> 00:17:51,817
Just hear me out.

286
00:17:51,984 --> 00:17:53,694
Oh, my God, what happened to you?

287
00:17:54,153 --> 00:17:55,196
No big deal.

288
00:17:55,362 --> 00:17:58,240
I just yanked a kid
out of the way of a speeding bus.

289
00:17:58,407 --> 00:18:00,201
Got clipped by the side mirror.

290
00:18:01,494 --> 00:18:03,537
Okay, that's a bunch of crap.

291
00:18:03,996 --> 00:18:05,706
But this is the truth.

292
00:18:05,873 --> 00:18:10,836
Mia, I have never felt about any woman
like I feel about you.

293
00:18:11,003 --> 00:18:13,339
And the thought of you
marrying some other guy is...

294
00:18:13,506 --> 00:18:15,341
It's breaking my heart.

295
00:18:15,508 --> 00:18:18,177
So I'm just going for broke here.

296
00:18:22,681 --> 00:18:24,600
Mia, I love you.

297
00:18:24,767 --> 00:18:27,186
I will always love you,
and I want you to marry me.

298
00:18:28,437 --> 00:18:31,774
Honey, the photographer wants to...

299
00:18:32,233 --> 00:18:35,277
- What's going on?
- Daddy, I told you about Charlie Harper.

300
00:18:35,444 --> 00:18:38,697
- Remember?
- Oh, good. I'm glad you're here, sir.

301
00:18:39,114 --> 00:18:41,158
I'd like to ask you for your...

302
00:18:47,623 --> 00:18:49,291
How much did you tell him?

303
00:18:59,986 --> 00:19:01,279
Thanks.

304
00:19:01,988 --> 00:19:05,283
- You need some more ice for your jaw?
- No.

305
00:19:05,449 --> 00:19:06,868
- Your nose?
- No.

306
00:19:07,034 --> 00:19:08,870
How about the chestnuts?

307
00:19:09,745 --> 00:19:13,666
- Resting comfortably. Thanks.
- Okay. Well, try to get some sleep.

308
00:19:16,377 --> 00:19:18,129
- Alan?
- Yeah?

309
00:19:18,629 --> 00:19:20,423
I learned something about myself.

310
00:19:20,590 --> 00:19:22,383
That you're a bleeder?

311
00:19:23,467 --> 00:19:25,595
I learned why I screw around so much.

312
00:19:26,679 --> 00:19:28,639
- Really?
- Yep.

313
00:19:29,515 --> 00:19:31,183
I think I've spent my whole life...

314
00:19:31,350 --> 00:19:35,855
trying to fill the empty space
in myself by, you know...

315
00:19:36,355 --> 00:19:38,691
Filling the empty space in others.

316
00:19:39,191 --> 00:19:40,484
Exactly.

317
00:19:40,651 --> 00:19:42,570
That's quite an insight.

318
00:19:42,737 --> 00:19:45,072
Well, I'm deep in therapy now.

319
00:19:45,531 --> 00:19:47,074
You went for one hour, Charlie.

320
00:19:47,658 --> 00:19:50,953
Fifty minutes. It's kind of a racket.

321
00:19:51,704 --> 00:19:55,541
But the point is, I've hit bottom.

322
00:19:55,708 --> 00:19:57,877
I can't keep going like this.

323
00:19:58,044 --> 00:20:00,504
- It's time for me to grow up.
- I agree.

324
00:20:00,671 --> 00:20:03,090
So, what are you gonna do?

325
00:20:04,091 --> 00:20:07,470
Well, I thought I'd find some chick
with a big heart and a tiny ass...

326
00:20:07,637 --> 00:20:09,096
and marry her.

327
00:20:11,057 --> 00:20:14,143
Maybe that girl from the beach.
She seemed nice.

328
00:20:14,977 --> 00:20:16,896
- You're going to get married?
- Yep.

329
00:20:17,063 --> 00:20:21,317
Settle down, have a couple of kids
and ship the penis up to Cooperstown.

330
00:20:22,526 --> 00:20:23,611
Cooperstown?

331
00:20:24,236 --> 00:20:25,946
It is my bat.

332
00:20:27,073 --> 00:20:29,784
Well, sounds like you've got
everything figured out.

333
00:20:30,409 --> 00:20:33,329
You don't ever
figure this stuff out, Alan.

334
00:20:33,496 --> 00:20:37,875
You just take little baby steps on a
lifelong path to becoming a better man.

335
00:20:40,586 --> 00:20:42,254
How many pain pills have you taken?

336
00:20:42,922 --> 00:20:44,215
Nine.

337
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:47,259
Good night.

338
00:20:49,428 --> 00:20:51,972
Might not be a bad idea
to check on me in an hour or so.

339
00:20:52,139 --> 00:20:55,601
- Make sure I'm still breathing.
- I always do.

340
00:21:09,365 --> 00:21:10,950
Mia.

341
00:21:16,622 --> 00:21:18,415
My balls.
