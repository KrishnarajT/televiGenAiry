1
00:00:01,015 --> 00:00:03,935
Hey, Berta, how have you been
washing my underwear?

2
00:00:04,102 --> 00:00:06,020
Like I do everything else around here:

3
00:00:06,187 --> 00:00:09,023
With a song on my lips
and love in my heart.

4
00:00:10,733 --> 00:00:12,068
I'm serious.

5
00:00:12,235 --> 00:00:14,779
I got a rash in my, you know,
private area.

6
00:00:15,947 --> 00:00:19,534
Private? You get more traffic
you're gonna have to open a Starbucks.

7
00:00:22,370 --> 00:00:24,455
I thought maybe
you'd changed laundry soap...

8
00:00:24,622 --> 00:00:27,083
because it's all red and itchy,
especially around...

9
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:28,543
Excuse me.

10
00:00:30,044 --> 00:00:33,214
I'm sitting here
eating a breakfast sausage.

11
00:00:34,924 --> 00:00:37,510
It's not a sausage problem.

12
00:00:37,677 --> 00:00:39,554
It's more in the meatball area.

13
00:00:43,141 --> 00:00:46,310
Kind of meatball adjacent.

14
00:00:47,145 --> 00:00:48,438
I bet it's swamp ass.

15
00:00:50,273 --> 00:00:51,399
What's swamp ass?

16
00:00:51,566 --> 00:00:54,318
Don't worry,
you'd know if you had swamp ass.

17
00:00:54,485 --> 00:00:56,863
Man, I hate swamp ass.

18
00:00:57,405 --> 00:01:00,199
- You sure it's just a rash?
- What else could it be?

19
00:01:00,366 --> 00:01:02,118
Since we're talking about your area...

20
00:01:02,285 --> 00:01:05,413
it could be anything
from Ebola to mad cow disease.

21
00:01:05,997 --> 00:01:07,582
You get Ebola from monkeys, right?

22
00:01:07,748 --> 00:01:08,833
Right.

23
00:01:09,709 --> 00:01:11,043
It's just a rash.

24
00:01:12,670 --> 00:01:16,340
A kid at school got swamp ass.
Cats followed him around for a year.

25
00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:21,679
- You know what? Let's forget about it.
- Oh, if only we could.

26
00:01:21,846 --> 00:01:24,265
Speaking of school,
we've got a big day ahead of us.

27
00:01:24,432 --> 00:01:26,267
Gotta go shopping for supplies, clothes.

28
00:01:26,893 --> 00:01:28,519
Nice segue, Dad.

29
00:01:28,686 --> 00:01:31,856
Well, the subject was crying out
for change.

30
00:01:32,023 --> 00:01:34,734
You're starting a new school.
You're gonna need new stuff.

31
00:01:34,901 --> 00:01:38,362
Wait a sec.
Melon Head made it into junior high?

32
00:01:38,529 --> 00:01:41,782
- Yes.
- So you passed summer school?

33
00:01:41,949 --> 00:01:44,452
- Sort of.
- What do you mean "sort of"?

34
00:01:44,619 --> 00:01:47,622
They said it was in everyone's
best interest if I moved on.

35
00:01:49,582 --> 00:01:50,625
What's that mean?

36
00:01:50,791 --> 00:01:52,668
Promoted him.
He's starting junior high.

37
00:01:52,835 --> 00:01:56,255
And there's absolutely nothing
to be gained in asking how or why.

38
00:01:57,465 --> 00:01:59,717
Okay, well, whatever.
I'm proud of you, man.

39
00:02:00,217 --> 00:02:01,761
- For what?
- I don't know...

40
00:02:01,928 --> 00:02:04,221
hanging in there
till they were sick of you.

41
00:02:04,388 --> 00:02:05,973
Thanks.

42
00:02:07,391 --> 00:02:09,644
So junior high, huh?

43
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:12,063
Boy, that brings back some memories,
doesn't it?

44
00:02:13,064 --> 00:02:14,815
Can we please not go down that road?

45
00:02:14,982 --> 00:02:16,067
What happened?

46
00:02:16,233 --> 00:02:20,112
Nothing. It's just that kids
in junior high can be a little judgmental.

47
00:02:20,655 --> 00:02:22,490
Especially if you're knocked up.

48
00:02:26,911 --> 00:02:28,579
Thank you, Berta.

49
00:02:28,746 --> 00:02:30,706
Of course, on the upside...

50
00:02:30,873 --> 00:02:33,834
the pregnant chicks
didn't have to go to gym.

51
00:02:34,001 --> 00:02:38,839
Did the guys who got them pregnant get
considerations? No, not even a hall pass.

52
00:02:40,091 --> 00:02:41,509
Are we quite done?

53
00:02:43,177 --> 00:02:44,512
Things will go great for you.

54
00:02:44,679 --> 00:02:47,181
- You just have to remember a few things.
- Like what?

55
00:02:47,348 --> 00:02:49,767
Well, always keep
your lunch money in your shoe...

56
00:02:49,934 --> 00:02:52,019
but have some spare change
in your pocket.

57
00:02:52,186 --> 00:02:53,437
- How come?
- Decoy money.

58
00:02:53,604 --> 00:02:56,023
They won't stop hitting you
till they get something.

59
00:02:57,316 --> 00:02:58,359
Who are "they"?

60
00:02:58,526 --> 00:03:01,612
The kids holding your ankles,
plunging your head in the toilet.

61
00:03:03,197 --> 00:03:04,699
Plunging my head in the toilet?

62
00:03:04,865 --> 00:03:08,119
Don't freak the kid out, Alan.

63
00:03:08,285 --> 00:03:10,955
It's not so much plunging as dipping.

64
00:03:12,206 --> 00:03:13,541
Here's what you do:

65
00:03:13,708 --> 00:03:16,836
Make friends with the janitor.
They usually have their own bathroom.

66
00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:21,006
- Okay.
- Just never drink out of his Thermos.

67
00:03:22,299 --> 00:03:23,342
All right.

68
00:03:23,509 --> 00:03:25,344
And don't believe he loves you.

69
00:03:28,973 --> 00:03:31,642
Damn it,
I miss that one-eyed son of a bitch.

70
00:03:35,855 --> 00:03:37,898
And if you have to shower
after gym class...

71
00:03:38,065 --> 00:03:40,693
there is no shame
in keeping your jockey shorts on.

72
00:03:41,777 --> 00:03:43,571
- Really?
- Okay, there's a little shame.

73
00:03:45,406 --> 00:03:48,659
The important thing is the fellas
won't be calling you Shrinky Dink.

74
00:03:50,744 --> 00:03:53,998
- Shrinky Dink?
- I'm a grower, not a shower.

75
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:58,502
Oh, I almost forgot.

76
00:03:59,253 --> 00:04:01,797
I got you a little present.

77
00:04:01,964 --> 00:04:05,009
- Your very own cell phone.
- Oh, cool.

78
00:04:05,176 --> 00:04:07,595
The important thing
to remember is this is not a toy.

79
00:04:07,761 --> 00:04:11,515
- It's to use in emergencies only.
- Emergencies? What emergencies?

80
00:04:11,682 --> 00:04:13,184
"Dad, come get me.

81
00:04:13,767 --> 00:04:17,271
I'm stuffed in my locker
and my underwear is wet."

82
00:04:25,946 --> 00:04:27,781
That only happened once.

83
00:04:28,866 --> 00:04:31,952
If that dog hadn't found you,
you'd have missed Thanksgiving.

84
00:04:33,579 --> 00:04:36,749
- Drug-sniffing dog?
- There were no drugs.

85
00:04:37,291 --> 00:04:40,544
That's true. Turns out those dogs
are also sensitive to urine.

86
00:04:42,504 --> 00:04:44,632
I was in there for five hours.

87
00:04:45,299 --> 00:04:46,800
Five hours?

88
00:04:47,301 --> 00:04:50,930
But you don't have to worry about that.
You have a cell phone.

89
00:04:52,056 --> 00:04:55,476
Which you should hide where
prisoners of war hid their watches.

90
00:04:56,685 --> 00:04:59,313
- Where was that?
- Moving on.

91
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,814
I've preprogrammed the phone:

92
00:05:00,981 --> 00:05:03,525
Speed dial one is me,
two is the nurse's office...

93
00:05:03,692 --> 00:05:05,277
and three is the police.

94
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,571
The police? What for?

95
00:05:07,738 --> 00:05:09,740
You'll know it when it happens.

96
00:05:09,907 --> 00:05:11,283
Now, about race riots...

97
00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:14,495
- Try not to take sides.
- Anybody asks, you're mulatto.

98
00:05:45,902 --> 00:05:48,571
- How do they feel?
- Okay, but they're ugly.

99
00:05:48,738 --> 00:05:50,490
They look like old-people shoes.

100
00:05:50,657 --> 00:05:53,076
They're not old-people shoes.
They're walking shoes.

101
00:05:53,243 --> 00:05:57,163
Right, for people
who've been walking for 85 years.

102
00:05:57,330 --> 00:05:59,582
I'd rather get these. These are cool.

103
00:05:59,749 --> 00:06:02,293
Listen, junior high
is not about being cool.

104
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:05,004
It's about
not getting mugged for sneakers.

105
00:06:05,171 --> 00:06:07,424
I can get mugged for my sneakers?

106
00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:09,759
Not those sneakers.

107
00:06:10,969 --> 00:06:13,430
Not unless you go by
an assisted-living facility...

108
00:06:13,596 --> 00:06:15,014
in a rough neighborhood.

109
00:06:16,766 --> 00:06:17,809
What are you doing?

110
00:06:22,647 --> 00:06:25,567
I'm sorry. This rash is driving me crazy.

111
00:06:25,734 --> 00:06:27,485
I feel stupid in these.

112
00:06:27,652 --> 00:06:30,155
Better to feel stupid
than to be tied to a flagpole...

113
00:06:30,321 --> 00:06:32,782
while upperclassmen
use you as a spittoon.

114
00:06:32,949 --> 00:06:34,993
I don't wanna be tied to a flagpole.

115
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:38,371
You won't be. Wear the ugly shoes
and don't sit at the wrong table.

116
00:06:38,538 --> 00:06:41,624
Wrong table?
How will I know if it's the wrong table?

117
00:06:41,791 --> 00:06:44,836
You'll be tied to a flagpole, right, Alan?

118
00:06:45,628 --> 00:06:48,673
That also only happened once.

119
00:06:49,674 --> 00:06:51,926
Let's just check the fit.

120
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:54,387
Good.

121
00:06:54,554 --> 00:06:56,139
Plenty of room for lunch money.

122
00:07:03,188 --> 00:07:05,064
How come all my clothes
have to be beige?

123
00:07:05,231 --> 00:07:08,610
Because beige is not the color
of any known gang.

124
00:07:08,776 --> 00:07:11,404
Right, instead of being mistaken
for a Crip or a Blood...

125
00:07:11,571 --> 00:07:13,448
you'll be mistaken for a Band-Aid.

126
00:07:13,948 --> 00:07:16,451
Hey, Band-Aids are ouchless.

127
00:07:20,121 --> 00:07:21,915
Excuse me? Excuse me, there's a line.

128
00:07:22,457 --> 00:07:25,043
- Yeah, I just got a couple of things.
- I can see that...

129
00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:27,212
but it's not based
on quantity of items.

130
00:07:27,378 --> 00:07:30,340
It's more of a
"we were here before you" kind of deal.

131
00:07:32,592 --> 00:07:34,510
You gonna make a thing out of this?

132
00:07:36,012 --> 00:07:39,182
There's no thing.
Just playing by the rules.

133
00:07:39,349 --> 00:07:42,227
And wouldn't it be nice
if everybody did the same?

134
00:07:42,852 --> 00:07:43,937
Hang on to this, slick.

135
00:07:45,688 --> 00:07:48,566
Now, you wanna explain
those rules again, jughead?

136
00:07:50,693 --> 00:07:53,529
You know what? If you're in a hurry,
why don't you go ahead?

137
00:07:54,155 --> 00:07:55,198
Thank you.

138
00:07:57,575 --> 00:07:59,327
What the hell are you doing?

139
00:08:01,621 --> 00:08:02,956
Nothing. Here.

140
00:08:08,378 --> 00:08:10,630
No, no, not chicken.
Just good common sense.

141
00:08:10,797 --> 00:08:15,134
- Fighting accomplishes nothing.
- Oh, I didn't know you were so French.

142
00:08:16,219 --> 00:08:17,971
- Hey.
- Oh, hey, Julie.

143
00:08:19,722 --> 00:08:21,849
How do you know my wife?

144
00:08:22,308 --> 00:08:25,186
What? Oh, no, no, no, I don't know her.

145
00:08:25,645 --> 00:08:27,188
You said, "Hey, Julie."

146
00:08:27,689 --> 00:08:30,984
No, no, I sneezed.

147
00:08:35,154 --> 00:08:37,407
- Gesundheit.
- Thank you.

148
00:08:38,032 --> 00:08:41,577
Oh, look, another cashier opened up.
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

149
00:08:47,417 --> 00:08:49,669
But Mom said I could wait
for the bus by myself.

150
00:08:49,836 --> 00:08:51,254
I know.

151
00:08:51,421 --> 00:08:53,715
I would really rather wait
for the bus by myself.

152
00:08:53,881 --> 00:08:56,009
I just wanna make sure
you get off okay.

153
00:08:56,175 --> 00:08:59,053
Yeah, but being walked to the bus stop
by my dad and my uncle?

154
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:00,930
I'm gonna look so lame.

155
00:09:01,097 --> 00:09:04,308
Jake, buddy, that ship has sailed.

156
00:09:10,732 --> 00:09:12,775
Please don't leave me.

157
00:09:13,609 --> 00:09:16,779
You're okay.
Just don't make eye contact.

158
00:09:18,281 --> 00:09:21,617
Okay, when the bus comes,
don't take a window seat.

159
00:09:21,784 --> 00:09:24,370
You don't wanna be trapped
and get pummeled.

160
00:09:24,537 --> 00:09:26,414
- Pummeled?
- And be polite to the driver.

161
00:09:26,581 --> 00:09:29,125
They tend to be damaged people
with short fuses.

162
00:09:29,292 --> 00:09:31,419
- Fuses?
- Don't distract him.

163
00:09:32,003 --> 00:09:33,296
There's no seat belts.

164
00:09:33,463 --> 00:09:36,299
One sharp turn, and you kids
will be flying like lotto balls.

165
00:09:36,466 --> 00:09:38,468
Balls?

166
00:09:42,138 --> 00:09:44,140
Wait, wait, wait.

167
00:09:46,142 --> 00:09:48,352
- Smile.
- About what?

168
00:09:48,519 --> 00:09:50,855
I need a current picture
in case you go missing.

169
00:09:51,022 --> 00:09:54,317
Alan, you're being ridiculous.
They never find those kids.

170
00:09:54,484 --> 00:09:56,402
Give me a profile.

171
00:09:57,820 --> 00:10:01,032
Okay, now go make it a great day.

172
00:10:02,116 --> 00:10:03,201
Have fun.

173
00:10:20,510 --> 00:10:22,678
I just hope everything turns out all right.

174
00:10:22,845 --> 00:10:27,350
Well, we've done all we could.
Now it's up to him.

175
00:10:38,495 --> 00:10:39,663
Okay. Okay.

176
00:10:39,830 --> 00:10:41,874
Tell the doctor that if I was a tree...

177
00:10:42,041 --> 00:10:46,045
the rash is predominantly
around the mossy trunk area.

178
00:10:52,009 --> 00:10:56,055
But I'm starting to see some redness
on the adjacent boulders.

179
00:10:57,681 --> 00:10:58,724
Oh, come on.

180
00:10:58,891 --> 00:11:01,643
Tree, two boulders,
what part don't you understand?

181
00:11:03,062 --> 00:11:04,271
- Hey.
- Hey.

182
00:11:04,438 --> 00:11:06,774
Okay, just have him call me.

183
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:08,484
- Heard from Jake?
- Nope.

184
00:11:08,650 --> 00:11:11,236
I'll call him at his mom's,
see how school went.

185
00:11:11,403 --> 00:11:14,823
- Alan, does this look infected to you?
- What?

186
00:11:15,407 --> 00:11:16,825
Get that away from me.

187
00:11:16,992 --> 00:11:19,411
I'm not asking you to tickle it.
Just take a look.

188
00:11:19,578 --> 00:11:20,913
No, thank you.

189
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,414
But you're a doctor.

190
00:11:22,581 --> 00:11:26,210
I'm a chiropractor.
I work with vertebrae.

191
00:11:26,376 --> 00:11:30,422
And contrary to popular belief,
there is not a single bone in the penis.

192
00:11:31,548 --> 00:11:33,342
Oh, hi, Judith.

193
00:11:34,426 --> 00:11:36,428
Nothing. I was just talking to Charlie.

194
00:11:36,595 --> 00:11:39,139
Hey, hey, is Jake home
from school yet?

195
00:11:39,306 --> 00:11:40,641
No?

196
00:11:40,808 --> 00:11:43,102
Okay, I was just
wondering how his first day went.

197
00:11:43,268 --> 00:11:46,939
Have him call me, okay?
Thanks, bye-bye.

198
00:11:48,524 --> 00:11:50,859
Hope he didn't wander
under bleachers during lunch.

199
00:11:51,026 --> 00:11:54,112
- He's smarter than that.
- Smart?

200
00:11:54,279 --> 00:11:57,574
He only got out of sixth grade
because he couldn't fit in the desks.

201
00:11:58,826 --> 00:12:01,245
If you're that concerned,
just call him on his cell.

202
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:03,288
Good idea.

203
00:12:18,929 --> 00:12:22,140
Jake? Jake, where are you?

204
00:12:24,142 --> 00:12:26,728
You're still on the bus.

205
00:12:29,982 --> 00:12:32,317
Funny, I don't hear the other kids.

206
00:12:32,484 --> 00:12:35,153
Oh, yeah, it was a tough day.
Everybody's tired.

207
00:12:37,239 --> 00:12:38,282
No kidding.

208
00:12:40,158 --> 00:12:42,744
Dad, this phone
is for emergencies only.

209
00:12:45,289 --> 00:12:46,832
Why aren't you at your mother's?

210
00:12:46,999 --> 00:12:50,002
I got off the bus at school,
got on another bus and came here.

211
00:12:50,168 --> 00:12:53,547
- So you've never been to school today?
- Of course not.

212
00:12:53,714 --> 00:12:57,926
I don't wanna be stuffed in a locker,
tied to a flagpole or dunked in a toilet.

213
00:12:58,927 --> 00:13:01,013
Not dunked. Dipped.

214
00:13:01,847 --> 00:13:05,934
- And where are your new sneakers?
- Oh, I sold them to the bus driver.

215
00:13:13,358 --> 00:13:15,110
Charlie, can I talk to you a minute?

216
00:13:16,570 --> 00:13:19,323
- Are those my comics?
- Charlie.

217
00:13:20,449 --> 00:13:23,452
They're near mint
and he wipes his boogers all over them.

218
00:13:24,202 --> 00:13:26,079
He was here all day
and you didn't know?

219
00:13:26,246 --> 00:13:28,832
Hey, I've got a rash.

220
00:13:30,792 --> 00:13:33,545
I can't believe he cut school
on his first day.

221
00:13:33,712 --> 00:13:35,714
When you think about it,
it's pretty smart.

222
00:13:35,881 --> 00:13:38,800
As far as the school is concerned,
he might just be a typo.

223
00:13:39,968 --> 00:13:42,220
Charlie, the question
is why did he cut school?

224
00:13:42,387 --> 00:13:43,597
Oh, that's easy.

225
00:13:43,764 --> 00:13:46,975
You scared the crap out of him
and dressed him like an ace bandage.

226
00:13:47,142 --> 00:13:49,227
Hey, hey,
I was just trying to prepare him.

227
00:13:49,394 --> 00:13:51,730
For what? A life of running and hiding?

228
00:13:51,897 --> 00:13:53,357
No, no, a life of blending in.

229
00:13:53,523 --> 00:13:55,400
Only if they see you,
running and hiding.

230
00:13:56,902 --> 00:13:59,738
Face it, Alan. When the lord
was handing out courage...

231
00:13:59,905 --> 00:14:02,532
you were crouched in a locker,
peeing on your socks.

232
00:14:04,076 --> 00:14:09,539
Okay, first of all,
I had had three Mr. Pibb's at lunch.

233
00:14:09,706 --> 00:14:11,583
And secondly, I am not a coward.

234
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:14,586
Come on. I've seen steelier nerves
from a cat on the freeway.

235
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:16,922
That's ridiculous.

236
00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:20,008
Dingo.

237
00:14:20,842 --> 00:14:24,554
Okay, I was not ready and that was
not fair. And what about you?

238
00:14:25,347 --> 00:14:27,432
- What about me?
- You're afraid of everything.

239
00:14:27,599 --> 00:14:30,185
- Like what?
- Well, let's see.

240
00:14:30,352 --> 00:14:32,437
Germs, change,
opening your eyes underwater...

241
00:14:32,604 --> 00:14:36,066
angry husbands, angry ex-girlfriends,
large birds, spiders and Mom.

242
00:14:37,150 --> 00:14:38,401
Hold on.

243
00:14:38,568 --> 00:14:40,403
Hold on a sec.

244
00:14:40,570 --> 00:14:44,074
I am not afraid to open my eyes
underwater, I'm just sensitive to chlorine.

245
00:14:44,658 --> 00:14:46,368
- Right.
- And for the record...

246
00:14:46,535 --> 00:14:48,203
it's just when birds get indoors.

247
00:14:48,370 --> 00:14:50,288
In the sky, I got no problem.

248
00:14:50,997 --> 00:14:52,958
Fine, fine. Live in denial.

249
00:14:53,125 --> 00:14:54,876
I'm gonna straighten my kid out.

250
00:14:55,919 --> 00:14:59,840
And what sane person
is not afraid of spiders?

251
00:15:02,801 --> 00:15:05,720
What I'm trying to say
is that it was wrong to fill your head...

252
00:15:05,887 --> 00:15:08,431
with a lot of horrible things
to avoid at school.

253
00:15:08,598 --> 00:15:10,851
Because the truth is
you can't avoid any of them.

254
00:15:11,017 --> 00:15:12,060
Charlie.

255
00:15:12,227 --> 00:15:13,979
You don't want him living in fear.

256
00:15:14,145 --> 00:15:16,898
- Well, yeah, but I was...
- Well, scary things happen in life.

257
00:15:17,065 --> 00:15:18,900
- He can hide like you...
- Like us.

258
00:15:19,067 --> 00:15:21,319
Don't nitpick.

259
00:15:21,486 --> 00:15:23,864
Or you can stand up to them.

260
00:15:24,030 --> 00:15:26,199
I mean, look,
getting hit in the face hurts.

261
00:15:26,366 --> 00:15:29,286
- But you know what hurts more?
- A kick in the crotch?

262
00:15:32,414 --> 00:15:34,082
Well, yeah, sure.

263
00:15:34,249 --> 00:15:37,919
I took a soccer ball to the nads once,
thought my eyes were gonna pop out.

264
00:15:44,134 --> 00:15:47,262
Yeah, but that pain passes.

265
00:15:47,429 --> 00:15:49,681
What hurts more
and lasts longer than anything...

266
00:15:49,848 --> 00:15:51,766
is the humiliation of running away.

267
00:15:51,933 --> 00:15:54,019
I couldn't ride my bike for a week.

268
00:15:55,270 --> 00:15:57,480
Jake, I think you're missing the point.

269
00:15:57,647 --> 00:16:01,067
Makes you wonder what they're doing
hanging down there in the first place.

270
00:16:02,319 --> 00:16:04,946
No, what I think Uncle Charlie
is trying to say...

271
00:16:05,113 --> 00:16:08,658
is that, yeah, you might get hit,
you might get stuffed in a locker...

272
00:16:08,825 --> 00:16:11,536
but you know what? You'll survive.

273
00:16:11,703 --> 00:16:14,873
You may get bruised, you may bleed,
you may lose a few teeth...

274
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:18,084
but you'll have your self-respect.

275
00:16:18,251 --> 00:16:21,296
- Exactly.
- How do you stop being afraid?

276
00:16:24,382 --> 00:16:25,467
Well, I drink.

277
00:16:34,517 --> 00:16:37,187
But I didn't start till ninth grade.

278
00:16:43,151 --> 00:16:46,780
Yeah, Judith.
He was at Charlie's the whole time.

279
00:16:46,946 --> 00:16:50,909
Well, he said
he was too scared to go to school.

280
00:16:53,244 --> 00:16:56,164
How should I know why he's so scared?

281
00:16:56,331 --> 00:16:59,125
Maybe you're overprotective.

282
00:16:59,292 --> 00:17:00,377
Good one.

283
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:04,672
I know you mean well.

284
00:17:04,839 --> 00:17:06,966
Oh, all right.
We'll be there in a few minutes.

285
00:17:07,133 --> 00:17:09,427
Okay. Bye-bye.

286
00:17:09,594 --> 00:17:11,596
- Did you hear that?
- Yeah, it's Mom's fault.

287
00:17:11,763 --> 00:17:13,473
Attaboy.

288
00:17:16,976 --> 00:17:20,063
Come on, it's green. Let's go.

289
00:17:23,691 --> 00:17:26,277
What's the matter with this guy?

290
00:17:29,864 --> 00:17:32,075
Looks like he's coming to tell you.

291
00:17:33,910 --> 00:17:36,162
Lock your doors. Lock your doors.

292
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:41,126
Wait, no, no, wait.
I am tired of running and hiding.

293
00:17:41,292 --> 00:17:43,628
- Are you tired of running and hiding?
- Yes, I am.

294
00:17:44,129 --> 00:17:47,173
Remember, Jake,
courage is not the absence of fear...

295
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:49,551
it's taking action despite fear.

296
00:17:49,717 --> 00:17:51,886
That's very true.

297
00:17:55,682 --> 00:17:58,143
- Let's do this.
- Right behind you.

298
00:18:05,567 --> 00:18:07,735
Two against one wouldn't be fair.

299
00:18:11,156 --> 00:18:15,910
Now, that's courage.
Aren't you proud of him?

300
00:18:16,077 --> 00:18:17,620
You got your cell phone?

301
00:18:17,787 --> 00:18:19,581
It's only for emergencies.

302
00:18:21,875 --> 00:18:23,960
Help me.

303
00:18:25,170 --> 00:18:27,589
I think this qualifies.

304
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:31,759
Charlie, Charlie, Charlie.

305
00:18:36,723 --> 00:18:39,559
- Hello?
- Hi.

306
00:18:41,227 --> 00:18:43,855
Charlie. Charlie.

307
00:18:53,016 --> 00:18:55,852
You are a bad brother.

308
00:18:56,019 --> 00:18:57,562
I really thought you had him.

309
00:18:59,022 --> 00:19:02,233
Mr. Harper, try not to sneeze.
You'll blow those stitches right out.

310
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,027
Thank you, doctor.

311
00:19:04,193 --> 00:19:07,739
Hey, doc, while I got you here,
let me show you something.

312
00:19:09,741 --> 00:19:12,660
Oh, my goodness.
Your little jimmy's all crimson.

313
00:19:12,827 --> 00:19:13,995
Yeah.

314
00:19:14,162 --> 00:19:15,204
So, what do you think?

315
00:19:15,747 --> 00:19:18,499
Well, it looks like an allergic reaction.

316
00:19:18,666 --> 00:19:20,918
You been applying anything
to your genital region?

317
00:19:21,544 --> 00:19:23,296
The usual, waitresses and actresses.

318
00:19:24,130 --> 00:19:26,549
Oh, wait, wait.
Does Grecian Formula count?

319
00:19:26,716 --> 00:19:28,092
Grecian Formula?

320
00:19:28,259 --> 00:19:30,344
You tried to get gray
out of your pubic hair?

321
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:33,264
I wanted to leave silver
around the sides.

322
00:19:33,431 --> 00:19:35,683
You know, look distinguished.

323
00:19:35,850 --> 00:19:38,686
Distinguished? That's interesting.

324
00:19:38,853 --> 00:19:41,064
We have a saying in my country:

325
00:19:41,230 --> 00:19:46,402
"You can put a tuxedo on a goat,
but it's still a goat."

326
00:19:46,569 --> 00:19:49,155
Yeah, well,
we have a saying in my country too:

327
00:19:49,322 --> 00:19:51,741
"Help me, my balls are on fire."

328
00:19:52,575 --> 00:19:55,328
Fair enough. I'll get you some salve.

329
00:19:58,081 --> 00:20:01,459
How about that? Allergic reaction.
Nothing to be scared of.

330
00:20:03,544 --> 00:20:06,089
All's well that ends well, right?

331
00:20:07,590 --> 00:20:09,425
What did they give you for the pain?

332
00:20:10,259 --> 00:20:12,762
You lucky bastard.

333
00:20:12,929 --> 00:20:15,473
I wish my balls hurt more.
