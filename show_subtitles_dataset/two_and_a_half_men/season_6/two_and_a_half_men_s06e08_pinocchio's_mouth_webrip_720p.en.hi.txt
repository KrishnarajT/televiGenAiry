Too late. I woke
up started.

7

a job for you.

maybe tonight

14
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:42,420
we could stay at my place.

I'm sorry,
did you say something?

18
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:52,040
I said maybe tonight
we could stay at my place.

19
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:55,060
You want to play on my face?

00:00:56,740 --> 00:00:59,480
Stay at my place.

21
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:01,000
Oh.

00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:02,550
What about it?

23
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:04,840
I've been coming here
for the past three weeks,

24
00:01:04,910 --> 00:01:07,580
and it's like an hour drive
for me to get to work.

25
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:10,460
Well, I'd be happy
to spring for a cab.

26
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:12,160
It's not the drive, you idiot.

27
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:13,620
You just said it was the drive.

28
00:01:13,690 --> 00:01:15,960
What I mean is if we're gonna
see each other

29
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:19,320
on a regular basis, there should
be some give and take.

30
00:01:19,390 --> 00:01:22,090
Based on last night,
we're pretty even Steven

31
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:23,760

Hey, of the two of us,
I'm the one with tennis elbow.

00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:40,020
I'd love to, but it might be
a little tricky.

Why?

37
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,790
(softly):
Oh, I knew she'd ask me that.

38
00:01:43,850 --> 00:01:45,550
I'm starting
to get the feeling

39
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:48,060
that you only want to see
at your place

40
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:49,990
and at your convenience.

41
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:53,430
No, of course not.

42
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:56,530
Well, then fine, you'll stay
at my place tonight.

43
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:57,970
Sounds great.

What did you do?

49
00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:22,960
I didn't do anything.

50
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:24,290
Why would you even ask me that?

51
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:27,330
I'm guessing he either robbed
a liquor store

52
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,700
or killed a drifter.

53
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,440
Do I need to call your mother
and ask her?

54
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:35,130
If you want to, but you know
how she pushes your buttons.

55
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,270
I'll take that chance.

56
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:39,280
Fine, I don't care.

57
00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:43,640
All right, all right!
I got thrown off the school bus.

58
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:45,870

of a gummy bear.

Well, actually,
it's a funny story.

61
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:54,450
Amuse me.

62
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:56,920
Have you ever heard of this
thing called mooning?

63
00:02:58,130 --> 00:03:00,230
Yeah. Yeah, it rings a bell.

64
00:03:00,290 --> 00:03:02,020
The bus was going past the
girls' track team

65
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:04,600
and a bunch of us thought
it'd be funny to moon them.

remembering my prom.

70
00:03:13,070 --> 00:03:14,770
(sighs)
So what happened?

71
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:17,340
Well, I was working near the
high school that night,

72
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:19,610
and I thought it would be fun
to drive the backhoe...

73
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:22,010

What happened?

77
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:31,230
Well, it sounds like
Berta had quite a prom.

78
00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:33,990
You're skating
on thin ice, Jake.

79
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:36,760

for two weeks.

tell me about this?

00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:44,300
I promised I'd tell you.

A little father-son bonding.

Is this Culver City place
popular?

104
00:04:33,090 --> 00:04:36,830

other people with cars

answer.

00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:52,570

spend the night together?

Aw, you poor guy.

113
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:58,350

She said there's
only street parking.

121

Which means trees.

122
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:23,000
And trees have that, you know,
toxic syrup

123
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:25,700

to the woman's house so that
you could make a quick getaway.

162
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:14,940
No, no, I'd much rather cuddle.

163

At my house,
we could do both.

164
00:07:18,490 --> 00:07:22,260

What now?

169
00:07:47,650 --> 00:07:49,490
Nothing. I'm just
used to sleeping

170
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:51,410
on the other side of the bed.

171
00:07:51,490 --> 00:07:53,360
Yeah, so?

172
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:55,220
So I usually sleep
on my left side,

173
00:07:55,290 --> 00:07:58,860
which faces me towards
the edge of the mattress.

174
00:07:58,930 --> 00:08:02,670
But here, I'm facing the back
of your head—which is fine;

175
00:08:02,730 --> 00:08:05,590
there are certainly times
when I enjoy seeing it

176
00:08:05,670 --> 00:08:07,670
from that angle—

177
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:10,440
but, you know,
when I'm trying to sleep,

178
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:12,840
it's a little disconcerting.

179
00:08:12,910 --> 00:08:16,480
Well, I'm sorry,
but this is my side.

180
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:19,470
But you sleep on the other side
at my house.

181
00:08:19,550 --> 00:08:22,150
Because it's your house;
this is my house.

182
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:23,490
But I'm a guest.

183
00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:24,510
And I'm the guest
at your house.

184
00:08:24,590 --> 00:08:26,590
That's different.
How?

185
00:08:26,650 --> 00:08:28,220
Give me a minute.

186
00:08:28,290 --> 00:08:30,500
Good night, Charlie.

187
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:35,370
Boy, you're being
pretty inflexible.

188
00:08:35,430 --> 00:08:37,700
Oh, you think
I'm inflexible.

189
00:08:37,770 --> 00:08:39,940
Well, not physically,

190
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,670
but you got to admit
in this regard,

191
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:44,210
you're a little stubborn.

192
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:49,140
Good night, Charlie.

193
00:08:52,210 --> 00:08:55,580
Okay. Good night.

194
00:08:58,220 --> 00:09:00,660
How about this?

195
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:03,590
If we switch sides
and an armed intruder came in,

196
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:04,930
I could leap up
and protect you.

197
00:09:04,990 --> 00:09:07,360
But this way,
you're pretty much guaranteed

198
00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:09,600
to catch the first bullet.

199
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:11,990
What if he comes
through the window?

200
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:16,930
Oh, great.

201
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,130

gonna get to sleep.

204
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:41,170

be watching TV.

and I stepped on a cat.

221

222

If you want to leave, leave.

223
00:11:26,570 --> 00:11:30,040

on the wrong side of the bed.

to revisit that topic.

Gee, you sound kind of angry.

227
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:41,580
Why would I
be angry?

228
00:11:41,650 --> 00:11:42,890
Just because I drive

229
00:11:42,950 --> 00:11:44,850
to Malibu every night
for a month,

230
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:46,590

couches, floors, witness boxes,
police cars, jail cells.

What the hell?

360

Can I have some privacy, please?

361
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:48,010
Get out of the tub.
Out of the tub.

362
00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:49,870
Fine.

363
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:52,470
You're unbelievable.
Is TV that important to you?

364
00:18:52,550 --> 00:18:54,620
Do you really
have to ask?

365
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:56,380
Go to your room.

366
00:18:56,450 --> 00:18:58,860
Fine, but check out Uncle
Charlie's toilet seat.

367
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:00,460
It heats up.

368
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:02,280
Just go!

369
00:19:04,390 --> 00:19:05,690
Can I have this
raspberry jam?

370
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:08,300
Don't touch the jam!

371
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:21,470
Oh...

372
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:24,640
Toasty.

373
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:29,450
If only I could poop at night.

374
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:33,160
Maybe I'll just pee
girly style.

What?

379
00:19:53,310 --> 00:19:54,680
This isn't working for me.

380
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:56,940
My feet too minty?

381
00:19:57,010 --> 00:19:58,580
It's not your feet.

382
00:19:58,650 --> 00:20:01,650
Well, it is your feet,
but it's also the sheets,

383
00:20:01,710 --> 00:20:04,510
the pillows, the towels, the TV,
the electric toothbrush.

384
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:06,350
It's not a toothbrush.

385
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:08,460
It's an ultrasonic dental
appliance.

386
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:09,980
It's probably got more
vibrations per minute

387
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:12,760
than that plastic egg
you keep in your nightstand.

388
00:20:14,730 --> 00:20:15,800
That's right.

389
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:17,760
I do have one of those.

390
00:20:17,830 --> 00:20:19,130
Go home.

391
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,410
But I want to spend
the night here.

392
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:22,770
No, no, I made a mistake.

393
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:25,010
From now on,
we'll stay at your place.

394
00:20:25,070 --> 00:20:26,870
Oh, okay.

395
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:27,880
Your call.

396
00:20:29,010 --> 00:20:31,750
I'm nothing if not flexible.
