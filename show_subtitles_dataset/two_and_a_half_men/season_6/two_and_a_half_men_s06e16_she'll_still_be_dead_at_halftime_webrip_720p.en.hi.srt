00:00:05,710 --> 00:00:07,750
(crowd cheering,
whistle blowing over TV)

3
00:00:07,810 --> 00:00:09,520
It seems to me
that it would be more fair

4
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:11,150
if everybody on both
basketball teams

5
00:00:11,210 --> 00:00:14,240
was the same height.

6
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:15,840
That's how it
seems to you, huh?

7
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:18,210
Yeah, like in boxing.

8
00:00:18,290 --> 00:00:19,560
Heavyweights
fight heavyweights.

9
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:22,020
Lightweights
fight lightweights.

10
00:00:22,090 --> 00:00:25,630
So, in your world,
everybody on a basketball team

11
00:00:25,690 --> 00:00:26,890
would be, say, 6'5",

12
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:28,520
and they'd only
play other teams

13
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:29,370
that were 6'5".

14
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:30,700
Exactly.

15
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:32,760
That way, no one would have
an unfair advantage.

16
00:00:32,830 --> 00:00:34,000
Huh.

17
00:00:34,070 --> 00:00:35,110
That's very interesting.

18
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:36,740
You really think so?

19
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:39,100
No, but it's less likely
to start a fight

20
00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:40,400
than "That's the dumbest thing

21
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:41,640
I've ever heard."

22
00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:44,050
And yet,
you said it anyway.

23
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:47,050
Listen, I've got to talk
to you about something.

24
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:49,340
Okay, "dumb" was a
poor choice of words.

25
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:51,190
It's not about that.

26
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:52,350
Can it wait till halftime?

27
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:54,230
No.

28
00:00:54,290 --> 00:00:55,590
(mutes TV)

29
00:00:55,660 --> 00:00:57,430
I've got to go
to a funeral this weekend.

30
00:00:57,490 --> 00:00:58,420
Oh, man, I'm sorry.

31
00:00:58,490 --> 00:00:59,450
Who died?

32
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:01,000
My ex-mother-in-law.

33
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:03,990
That couldn't wait
till halftime?
Charlie.

34
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:07,130
I'm just saying she'll
still be dead at halftime.

35
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,330
I was very close to her

36
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,130
and I want to pay my respects,

37
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:14,080
so I'm going to Santa Barbara,

38
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:16,810
and I'll be spending the weekend
with my ex-husband.

39
00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:19,710
Oh, okay.

40
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:21,840
(TV audio resumes)

41
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,460
ANNOUNCER:
They certainly are very...

42
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:26,020
Define "with."

43
00:01:26,090 --> 00:01:28,930
Well, everyone's staying
at his parents' house.

44
00:01:28,990 --> 00:01:31,200
All right... well, do you
want me to come with you?

45
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:33,200
No.
Great.

46
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,940
ANNOUNCER:
But, once again, Barry,
most of...

47
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,140
Why not?

48
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,310
Do you want to come?

49
00:01:40,370 --> 00:01:41,410
Hell, no.

50
00:01:41,470 --> 00:01:43,080
That's what I figured.

51
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:46,900
Look, I just want
to be up-front with you.

52
00:01:46,970 --> 00:01:48,570
I was married to Alex
for eight years,

53
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,840
and I just don't want you
to get the wrong idea.

54
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:52,640
I wouldn't have had any idea

55
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:54,640
if you hadn't felt
the need to tell me.

56
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:57,020
Yeah, well,
I don't want us

57
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:58,810
to have any secrets
from each other.

58
00:01:58,890 --> 00:01:59,990
Oh, I agree.

59
00:02:00,050 --> 00:02:02,350
We definitely should
not have secrets.
Right.

60
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:05,290
You know, from this
point forward.

61
00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:12,200
ANNOUNCER:
had control of the ball
and lost the...

62
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:14,040
What kind of guy is this Alex?

63
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:14,930
He's a good guy.

64
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,360
We just got married
too young

65
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:17,910
and wanted
different things.

66
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:20,770
He wanted something
different than your things?

67
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:23,340
'Cause your things
are terrific.

68
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:25,010
Thank you.

69
00:02:26,450 --> 00:02:29,890
ANNOUNCER:
Some golden opportunities
to score.

70
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:31,310
He didn't go gay
on you, did he?

71
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:32,980
No.

72
00:02:33,050 --> 00:02:34,620
Rats.

73
00:02:34,690 --> 00:02:36,430
Are you jealous?

74
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:37,730
No, no.

75
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:38,990
Of course not.

76
00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:41,360
I mean, maybe a little.

77
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:44,040
You know, in the sense
that his mother's dead.

How was the funeral?

87
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:25,980
Yeah, I guess
they're all pretty sad.

88
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:28,610
Probably why they don't
call them fun-erals.

89
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:30,350
(chuckling)

90
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:32,810
Yeah, that was lame.

91
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:35,710
So, where are you now,
at the house?

92
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:37,650
And where is your ex-husband?

93
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:42,350
And where is his room
in relationship to yours?

94
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:45,150
Hey, hey, it's got nothing
to do with jealousy.

95
00:03:45,230 --> 00:03:47,600
I just know, based on a lifetime
of experience,

96
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:51,730
that penises do not observe
a traditional mourning period.

97
00:03:52,730 --> 00:03:54,460
Forget it, you are not
driving my car

98
00:03:54,530 --> 00:03:55,800
until you get
a learner's permit.

99
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:57,080
Not even in the driveway?

100
00:03:57,140 --> 00:03:58,110
Not anywhere.

101
00:03:58,170 --> 00:03:59,500
What if you have
a heart attack?

102
00:03:59,570 --> 00:04:00,770
Can I drive you
to the hospital?

103
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,340
No, call an ambulance.

104
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:03,850
Fine.

105
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:05,510
If they don't get
here in time,

106
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:06,820
can I have your car?

107
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:10,560
Hey.

108
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:11,860
There's my posse.

109
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,430
What are we doing
tonight, boys?

110
00:04:13,490 --> 00:04:14,960
Think big. It's my treat.

111
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:17,030
Drunk?

112
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:18,450
Probably.

113
00:04:18,530 --> 00:04:19,970
Where is Chelsea?

114
00:04:20,030 --> 00:04:21,730
She had to go out of town.

115
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:24,570
Oh, so your girlfriend's
gone for a couple of days.

116
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:26,700
Now, suddenly, you
have time for us?

117
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:27,910
Yeah.

118
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:31,880
You ever think that maybe Jake
and I already have plans?

119
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:34,550
That our lives go on
even when you're not around?

120
00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:35,950
That we don't just pop
into existence

121
00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:37,350
the moment you need us?

122
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:38,770
I'm free.

123
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:41,410
Me, too.
I'm just making a point.

124
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:44,560
So, what's it going to be?

125
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:45,690
A movie, bowling?

126
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:47,520
Putt-putt, Nevada cathouse?

127
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:49,730
I vote for cathouse.

128
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:51,390
Do you even know
what a cathouse is?

129
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:52,530
Not firsthand.

130
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:55,760
That's why I voted for it.

131
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,010
A movie would be fine.

132
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:03,240
All right, a movie it is.

133
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:04,330
What's out that's good?

134
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,600
There's a new pirate movie.

135
00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:07,800
It's rated "Arr!"

136
00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:13,610
You guys have no sense of humor.

137
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,810
♪ Men.

138
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:17,380
Can we go to
that new theater

139
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:20,750
with the reserved seats
and the jumbo kosher hot dogs?

140
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:22,180
You just finished
dinner.

141
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:24,930
That doesn't mean
I finished eating.

142
00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:27,900
Hey, Charlie.

143
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:30,060
Wanda...
what are you doing here?

144
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:33,500
I was in the neighborhood,
and I'm drunk and horny.

145
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:36,230
New plan.

146
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:41,180
♪ Men.

147
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:48,090
Have I met
this one before?

148
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:49,690
I doubt it.

149
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:51,120
She looks familiar.

150
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:53,650
Blond, busty, and bombed?

151
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,220
Around here, that's familiar.

152
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:58,730
I thought Uncle Charlie
liked Chelsea.

153
00:05:58,790 --> 00:06:01,760
He does.
Well, then, what's he doing
with Wanda?

154
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:03,800
Well, buddy, it's like this.

155
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:06,330
Uh, despite his many
admirable qualities,

156
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:10,110
your Uncle Charlie is,
at heart, a sleazeball.

157
00:06:10,170 --> 00:06:11,700
That's what I figured.

158
00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:13,740
I just wanted a second opinion.

159
00:06:13,810 --> 00:06:16,010
Hang on.
I'll grab another bottle.

160
00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:20,280
Broad is part camel.

161
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:25,290
Except the humps
aren't on her back.

162
00:06:27,650 --> 00:06:28,780
Oh, come on.

163
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:31,030
That was funnier
than "Rated arr!"

164
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:33,020
(sighs)

165
00:06:33,090 --> 00:06:35,490
Look, I know you're upset,
but I'll take you

166
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:36,860
to the movies
some other time.

167
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:38,530
This has nothing to do
with the movie.

168
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,840
Then what's the problem?

169
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:42,160
The problem
is you're a sleazeball.

170
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:44,330
Really? How so?

171
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,830
Oh, please.

172
00:06:45,910 --> 00:06:46,910
You're in a committed
relationship

173
00:06:46,970 --> 00:06:48,140
with a wonderful woman,

174
00:06:48,210 --> 00:06:49,380
and the minute
her back is turned,

175
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,210
you're out gallivanting.

176
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:52,120
Gallivanting?
Screwing around.

177
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:54,590
Then, why don't you just say,
"Screwing around"?

178
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:59,720
Hey, as we speak, Chelsea is
doing the same thing I'm doing.

179
00:06:59,790 --> 00:07:00,930
Oh, really?

180
00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:02,090
She's pouring liquor
down the throat

181
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,630
of an inebriated party girl?

182
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:05,020
Inebriated?
Drunk.

183
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:07,220
Geez, who are you
showing off for?

184
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,200
At this moment,

185
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:13,630
Chelsea is in the same house
as her ex-husband.

186
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:15,500
Why?
His mother died.

187
00:07:15,570 --> 00:07:16,980
Oh, my apologies.

188
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:19,510
Clearly, anything you do
at this point is justified.

189
00:07:19,570 --> 00:07:21,840
No, it's not.
I was being disingenuous.

190
00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:23,650
What?
Sarcastic.

191
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:27,280
You know, this is why Mom
gets pissed off at you so much.

192
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:29,820
Look.

193
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:31,310
Charlie, do what you want.

194
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:33,280
If you can live with yourself,
more power to you.

195
00:07:33,350 --> 00:07:34,950
If I could live with myself,

196
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:36,950
we'd be having this conversation
by telephone.

197
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:40,570
See, him I understand.

198
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:43,970
Charlie, bed, now, come.

199
00:07:45,570 --> 00:07:47,070
Succinct, ain't she?

200
00:07:48,970 --> 00:07:52,040
Does "succinct" mean
what I think it means?

201
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:55,370
I highly doubt it.

202
00:08:00,850 --> 00:08:02,520
Hello?

203
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:06,180
Right here, baby.

204
00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:08,080
(loud thudding)

205
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,860
Are you okay?

206
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:12,050
Yeah, why?

207
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:15,160
Never mind. (clears throat)

208
00:08:15,230 --> 00:08:15,930
Come on.

209
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,140
Come on.

210
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,600
Let's get you
into bed.

211
00:08:18,670 --> 00:08:20,010
(sighs)
Thank you.

212
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:22,010
Hey, you remember
when we were in Vegas

213
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:24,640
and I talked that cute waitress
into joining us?

214
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:25,970
Yeah, I do.

215
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:28,350
I saw her last week
at the Hard Rock.

216
00:08:28,410 --> 00:08:29,150
No kidding.

217
00:08:29,210 --> 00:08:31,450
She gained a lot of weight.

218
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:32,470
Is that so?

219
00:08:32,550 --> 00:08:33,690
Yeah, we were lucky.

220
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:37,490
We nailed her right before
she quit smoking.

221
00:08:38,590 --> 00:08:39,790
Listen, Wanda, uh...

222
00:08:39,850 --> 00:08:41,980
She does smell better, though.

223
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:43,530
I'm sure, but listen...

224
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:44,590
Like Fritos.

225
00:08:47,090 --> 00:08:48,360
You know what?

226
00:08:48,430 --> 00:08:51,270
I got to...
check on something.

227
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:54,130
Well, is it okay
if I start without you?

228
00:08:55,570 --> 00:08:57,480
Top drawer, nightstand—
take your pick.

229
00:08:58,740 --> 00:08:59,610
Ooh.

230
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:00,770
Careful.

231
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,640
The big one's
a flashlight.

232
00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:07,590
That was fast.

233
00:09:08,950 --> 00:09:11,060
I'm guessing.

234
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:15,220
You're right.

235
00:09:15,290 --> 00:09:17,400
I'm a sleazeball.

236
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:20,370
Don't tell me you actually
had a moral epiphany.

237
00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:23,070
Uh, "epiphany"
means...
Don't bother.

238
00:09:26,130 --> 00:09:27,600
I don't know what
you call it,

239
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:31,110
but I've got a gorgeous,
willing girl in my bed,

240
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:32,800
and I'm just
not interested.

241
00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:35,170
Maybe you're a gay sleazeball.

242
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,250
I'll tell you
what's going on.

243
00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:40,040
You care about Chelsea
too much

244
00:09:40,110 --> 00:09:41,180
to cheapen
your relationship

245
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:42,750
with a meaningless
one-night stand.

246
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:46,150
You're right.

247
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:47,230
I do care about Chelsea.

248
00:09:47,290 --> 00:09:49,460
I'm crazy about her.

249
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:51,150
Boy, that sucks.

250
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:53,360
(phone ringing)

251
00:09:54,490 --> 00:09:56,160
Hello.

252
00:09:56,230 --> 00:09:57,440
Oh, hey, Chelsea,
we were just...

253
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:58,940
Give me that.

254
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,340
Hey, baby,
what's going on?

255
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,900
He did?

256
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:05,080
At his own mother's funeral?

257
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:07,910
Her ex-husband put
the moves on her.

258
00:10:07,970 --> 00:10:09,400
What a sleazeball.

259
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:13,640
No, no, no,
don't blame yourself.

260
00:10:13,710 --> 00:10:16,780
You were right
to go to the funeral.

261
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:19,290
Tonight?

262
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:22,120
(stammering):
I'd love to see you tonight,

263
00:10:22,190 --> 00:10:24,200
but... isn't it a little late

264
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:27,270
to drive all the way
from Santa Barbara?

265
00:10:27,330 --> 00:10:29,670
Oh, you're already on the road.

266
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:32,140
Oh, that close?

267
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:34,970
Wonderful.

268
00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:36,160
Drive safe.

269
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,080
Crap, crap, crap, crap, crap,

270
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:39,280
crap, crap, crap,
crap, crap, crap.

271
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:40,450
Crap, crap, crap,
crap, crap,

272
00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:42,080
crap, crap, crap,
crap, crap, crap...

273
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:44,610
Remember when I was little and
every time someone said "crap",

274
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:46,880
they had to put a dollar
in the swear jar?

275
00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:48,190
I do.

276
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:50,260
Whatever happened
to all that money?

277
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:54,080
Wanda, I don't want you
to take this the wrong way,

278
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:56,620
but you got to get the hell
out of here.

279
00:10:56,690 --> 00:10:58,560
Come on. Chop-chop.

280
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:01,930
Wanda?

281
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:06,630
(smacks lips)

282
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:08,640
Wanda...!

283
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:11,070
(snores)

284
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:20,680
Oh, darn.

285
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:23,090
*Men. ♪

286
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:27,020
♪ Men.

287
00:11:27,090 --> 00:11:29,790
So the car's
a time machine?

288
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:31,200
Yeah, it's called
a DeLorean.

289
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:32,260
They don't make 'em
anymore.

290
00:11:32,330 --> 00:11:33,930
CHARLIE:
Crap, crap, crap, crap,

291
00:11:33,990 --> 00:11:36,160
crap, crap, crap, crap, crap,
crap, crap, crap, crap, crap.

292
00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:37,670
Help. I need help.

293
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:39,360
Oh, my God, w-what happened?
What's wrong?

294
00:11:39,430 --> 00:11:41,530
Wanda passed out
and Chelsea's on her way over.

295
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,130
Interesting story
about the DeLorean.

296
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:46,870
It was built by a man named
John DeLorean.

297
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:47,980
Are you not listening to me?

298
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,470
I've got an emergency here.

299
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:51,470
A dead girl in your bed
is an emergency.

300
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:53,680
A passed-out girl
is a dinner date.

301
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:58,290
I still don't understand why
it's called Back to the Future.

302
00:11:58,350 --> 00:11:59,810
Because they're stuck
in the past,

303
00:11:59,890 --> 00:12:01,490
and they have to get back...

304
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:03,420
Home.

305
00:12:05,090 --> 00:12:06,420
Oh, for God's sake, come on!

306
00:12:06,490 --> 00:12:07,790
My girlfriend's on her way over,

307
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:09,860
and I've got a half-naked broad
upstairs!

308
00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:12,240
Half-naked. I'm your man.

309
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,560
Sit down.

310
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:18,280
Have you tried
waking her up?

311
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:20,380
Well, of course
I've tried waking her up.

312
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:22,070
This is not my first
drunk bimbo!

313
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:23,770
So, what do you expect us to do?

314
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:26,210
I expect you to help me get her
dressed and drive her home.

315
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:28,690
Enough talk.
Let's get to it.

316
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:32,060
I said, sit down.

317
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:32,990
Where does she live?

318
00:12:33,050 --> 00:12:34,380
I have no idea.

319
00:12:34,450 --> 00:12:35,480
So, how am I supposed
to drive her home?

320
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:37,500
Oh, come on. Do I have to think

321
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:38,830
of everything? Just help me!

322
00:12:38,890 --> 00:12:40,320
(sighs)
All right.

323
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:51,610
Wow.

324
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:54,600
Oh, and I'm a sleazeball?

325
00:12:54,670 --> 00:12:56,570
You're-You're misreading
my-my "wow."

326
00:12:56,640 --> 00:13:00,070
I meant "Wow, what
a predicament."

327
00:13:00,150 --> 00:13:01,890
Yeah, right.

328
00:13:01,950 --> 00:13:03,860
You hold her up.

329
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:05,020
I'll put her dress on.

330
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:06,250
Okay.

331
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,460
She's very fit.

332
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:10,220
(grunts)
Hold her arms up.

333
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:11,690
Really soft skin.

334
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:12,930
Uh-huh.

335
00:13:12,990 --> 00:13:14,690
Hmm. Smells nice, too.

336
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:17,660
Okay, why don't you just put
a chloroform-soaked handkerchief

337
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:20,860
over her face and throw her
in the back of your panel van?

338
00:13:20,930 --> 00:13:24,970
Sounds like a waste
of chloroform, doesn't it?

339
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:30,310
Okay, you get her head;
I'll get her feet.

340
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:31,420
Why do you get her feet?

341
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:32,980
What difference does it make?

342
00:13:33,050 --> 00:13:35,120
I like feet.

343
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:36,110
Just get her head.

344
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:39,710
Okay, on three.

345
00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:42,190
One, two, three.

346
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:43,830
Three. Oh! Oh! Oh!

347
00:13:43,890 --> 00:13:45,690
Goodness. Aah.

348
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:46,330
(panting)

349
00:13:46,390 --> 00:13:47,790
Slowly, slowly.

350
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:49,760
Slowly, my ass. Come on.
Let's get her out of here.

351
00:13:49,830 --> 00:13:51,800
Charlie. Charlie...!

352
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:53,560
Oh!
(thudding)

353
00:13:53,630 --> 00:13:56,930
Goodness gracious,
these are real.

354
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,870
♪ Men.

355
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:05,920
Slowly. Slowly.

356
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:07,690
(doorbell rings)

357
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:10,890
Quickly. Quickly.

358
00:14:12,950 --> 00:14:14,320
Hi, baby.

359
00:14:14,390 --> 00:14:15,490
Come on in.

360
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:20,760
Oh, Charlie, you were
so right about Alex.

361
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:23,690
Alex?

362
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:25,930
Oh, yeah. Alex.

363
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,200
What a sleazeball.

364
00:14:27,270 --> 00:14:28,940
Can I get you something
to drink?

365
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,300
No. I just want to get
in bed and hold you.

366
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:32,600
Oh, boy, does that sound good.

367
00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:34,240
Let me just say
good night to Jake.

368
00:14:34,310 --> 00:14:35,110
Okay. I'll meet you upstairs.

369
00:14:35,170 --> 00:14:36,800
You know what?

370
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:39,880
Why don't you come
say good night, too?

371
00:14:39,950 --> 00:14:41,590
Why?

372
00:14:41,650 --> 00:14:44,090
Well, you're my girlfriend,
and he's my nephew,

373
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:46,280
and... isn't that enough?

374
00:14:47,890 --> 00:14:48,760
Hey, Jake...

375
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:50,490
Might want to
hang back a sec.

376
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:53,000
I just ripped off
an air biscuit.

377
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:53,830
What?

378
00:14:53,890 --> 00:14:55,020
I farted.

379
00:14:55,090 --> 00:14:57,460
Sorry. I get the fancy words
from my dad.

380
00:14:58,870 --> 00:15:01,340
Anyway, Chelsea and I just
wanted to say good night.

381
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,200
Okay.

382
00:15:03,270 --> 00:15:05,340
He keeps his feelings
bottled up.

383
00:15:05,410 --> 00:15:07,240
Everything else he shoots
into the atmosphere.

384
00:15:07,310 --> 00:15:08,380
Hi, Chelsea.

385
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:09,700
Hi, Alan.

386
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:11,520
Uh, sorry to hear
about your ex-mother-in-law.

387
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:12,850
Oh, thank you.
Oh, hey, Jake.

388
00:15:12,910 --> 00:15:15,040
I could really use
your help.
With what?

389
00:15:15,110 --> 00:15:16,980
I'm taking out the... Whew!

390
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:21,060
I'm taking out the trash.

391
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,750
What are you talking about?

392
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:24,750
The trash.

393
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:25,990
I'm taking it out,

394
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:28,670
and I could use your help
carrying it.

395
00:15:28,730 --> 00:15:31,270
Oh. So now you want my help?

396
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:32,860
Yes, now I want your help.

397
00:15:32,930 --> 00:15:35,400
What about the 20 bucks
you owe me?

398
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:38,510
Charlie?

399
00:15:40,970 --> 00:15:42,670
Here.

400
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:45,710
Is the trash still out
where you can see it?

401
00:15:47,150 --> 00:15:48,420
Never mind.

402
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,380
Just go help your father.

403
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:51,550
Fine.

404
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:52,790
Nice seeing you, Chelsea.

405
00:15:52,850 --> 00:15:53,880
Good night.

406
00:15:53,950 --> 00:15:56,920
I could have said 50,
couldn't I?

407
00:15:56,990 --> 00:15:59,700
Could have said a hundred.

408
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:01,470
Can we please go
to bed now?

409
00:16:01,530 --> 00:16:03,100
Beds are for amateurs.

410
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:05,230
Oh, Charlie.

411
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:07,100
(sniffing)

412
00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:13,310
What if Jake comes back?

413
00:16:13,370 --> 00:16:16,140
We'll breathe
through our mouths.

414
00:16:21,610 --> 00:16:24,110
She really does
look familiar.

415
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:26,010
Terrific. Just don't drop her.

416
00:16:26,090 --> 00:16:28,190
I can't wait to tell my friends
about this.

417
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:29,980
You're not telling anybody
about this.

418
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:32,530
What's the point of doing it
if I can't tell anybody?

419
00:16:32,590 --> 00:16:35,860
You've got 20 bucks
and a memory. Now shut up.

420
00:16:35,930 --> 00:16:38,900
Okay, we've got
to get her in the car.

421
00:16:38,970 --> 00:16:41,370
You want me to pull it around?
No, I don't want you
to pull it around!

422
00:16:41,430 --> 00:16:45,270
Okay, well, then, you pull it
around, I'll stay here with her.

423
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:47,010
But be very careful.

424
00:16:47,070 --> 00:16:50,300
CHELSEA:
Come on, let's
finish this upstairs.

425
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:52,480
Move, move, move!

426
00:16:55,110 --> 00:16:56,480
Chelsea, wait.
What?

427
00:16:56,550 --> 00:16:58,590
I'm so happy you're back.

428
00:17:01,190 --> 00:17:03,130
Hey.

429
00:17:03,190 --> 00:17:04,930
Oh, hey, Alan.

430
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:06,290
Is the trash out?

431
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:07,800
Uh, almost.

432
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:10,090
Almost ain't
gonna cut it.

433
00:17:11,730 --> 00:17:14,900
Did you at least
clean out my room?

434
00:17:14,970 --> 00:17:16,510
Yes, I did.

435
00:17:16,570 --> 00:17:17,680
Good. Good.

436
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:19,640
Okay, well, good night.

437
00:17:19,710 --> 00:17:21,950
Uh, Charlie, can I talk
to you for a sec?

438
00:17:22,010 --> 00:17:23,180
About what?

439
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:24,940
Um... uh, recycling.

440
00:17:25,010 --> 00:17:28,010
I'm not quite sure
what to do with the...

441
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:30,080
big jugs.

442
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:34,350
Oh. Honey, why don't you go up
and get comfortable,

443
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:36,250
and I'll be right there?
Hurry.

444
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:37,820
I will.

445
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:40,620
Okay, first you need to separate
the plastic from the glass.

446
00:17:40,690 --> 00:17:41,720
Then when you get
to the newspaper...

447
00:17:41,790 --> 00:17:42,760
What the hell is your problem?

448
00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:44,170
She's in Jake's room.

449
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:46,090
What am I supposed to do?

450
00:17:46,170 --> 00:17:48,010
I don't know.

451
00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:49,010
Here's my credit card.

452
00:17:49,070 --> 00:17:50,980
Take her to a hotel
or something.

453
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:53,310
Okay. Chain motel
or someplace nicer?

454
00:17:53,370 --> 00:17:54,670
What?

455
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:56,170
You know, uh, room
service, ocean view.

456
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,170
That way when she
regains consciousness,

457
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:59,310
she won't feel so cheap.

458
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:01,150
Plus, in the
nicer places,

459
00:18:01,210 --> 00:18:02,980
you have a free
continental breakfast.

460
00:18:03,050 --> 00:18:06,090
Assorted pastries, coffee,
freshly squeezed orange juice...

461
00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:08,350
I know what
a continental breakfast is!

462
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:09,980
Just get her the hell
out of here!

463
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:11,200
Okay, fine.

464
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:13,800
Oh, Charlie?

465
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:15,190
What?

466
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:16,260
I'm a little low on gas.

467
00:18:16,330 --> 00:18:17,370
Use the card!

468
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:18,840
Right, right, right.

469
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:20,340
Charlie?

470
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,140
What?

471
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:24,370
I'm really happy you're trying
to make it work with Chelsea.

472
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:25,740
Go!

473
00:18:34,410 --> 00:18:35,640
What the hell are you doing?

474
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:37,520
You said I could have a memory.

475
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:39,310
This is it.

476
00:18:39,390 --> 00:18:40,420
Give me the phone.

477
00:18:40,490 --> 00:18:41,730
Oh, good idea.

478
00:18:41,790 --> 00:18:42,990
I can't get us both
in the frame.

479
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:47,450
Can you make it look like
we're talking to each other?

480
00:18:47,530 --> 00:18:48,600
Forget the picture.

481
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:49,990
We have to bring the car around.

482
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:51,860
Shouldn't someone
stay here with Wanda?

483
00:18:51,930 --> 00:18:53,600
Yeah, but it shouldn't be you.

484
00:18:57,740 --> 00:18:59,010
Give me the keys.

485
00:18:59,070 --> 00:19:00,740
You said I could
pull it around.

486
00:19:00,810 --> 00:19:01,950
I changed my mind.

487
00:19:02,010 --> 00:19:04,680
Okay. I'll tell Mom about Wanda.

488
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:11,580
One ding, one scratch,
and you're dead.

489
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:12,980
Dude, mellow out.

490
00:19:13,050 --> 00:19:15,080
You'll give yourself
a heart attack.

491
00:19:22,190 --> 00:19:24,530
(sighs)

492
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:25,900
Hey, look!

493
00:19:25,970 --> 00:19:27,670
It's me!

494
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:32,070
I'm glad you came back.

495
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:34,110
I don't like it
when you're gone.

496
00:19:34,170 --> 00:19:36,840
I don't like it
when I'm gone, either.

497
00:19:36,910 --> 00:19:40,280
Oh. Here they are.

498
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:48,330
Funny story.

499
00:19:48,390 --> 00:19:51,030
♪ Men.

500
00:19:57,430 --> 00:19:58,840
Why do you get
to take her feet?

501
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:00,670
Because I'm in charge
of this operation,

502
00:20:00,730 --> 00:20:02,000
and I like feet.

503
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:05,010
Hey.

504
00:20:08,570 --> 00:20:11,170
I guess we don't have
to take her to a hotel, huh?

505
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:12,870
No, we don't.

506
00:20:12,950 --> 00:20:13,750
Quick, get in the car.

507
00:20:13,810 --> 00:20:15,410
Where are we going?

508
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:22,850
Anywhere we want. We've got
Uncle Charlie's credit card.
