and not be freaked out.

188
00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:24,110
Alan was just showing
me his butt exercises.

189
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:26,580
Have him show you the one where
he sticks his head up there.

190

Exactly.

I wasn't gonna,

200
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:05,180
but your lovely fiancée
and her new gal pal insisted.

201
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:09,450
Yeah, I've got to put
a stop to that.

I was being punished.

359
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:04,950
You and me both.

360
00:16:05,010 --> 00:16:08,380
But come to find out,
it was a blessing.

361
00:16:08,450 --> 00:16:10,220
With him in my life,
I think

362
00:16:10,290 --> 00:16:12,530
I can actually make my
relationship with Chelsea work.

363
00:16:12,590 --> 00:16:15,460
So you're really gonna go
through with this marriage?

364
00:16:15,530 --> 00:16:18,570
Absolutely. I'm ready
for the whole shebang.

365
00:16:18,630 --> 00:16:20,000
Kids, too?

366
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:22,630
Well, it's certainly
in the cards.

367
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:24,740
Of course, I'd have
to talk it over

368
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,760
with Chelsea
and Alan first.

369
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:30,410
Wow, marriage and kids.

370
00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:32,000
I can't believe
what I'm hearing.

371
00:16:32,070 --> 00:16:33,840
What can I say, Berta?

372
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:36,740
He completes me.

we'll talk tomorrow.

What now?

387
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:11,810
Hang on.

388
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:15,950

chew up the rug."

Nothing.

391
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:23,590
Why would I
chew up a rug?

392
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:26,920
Not a rug, my...
never mind.

393
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:31,910
Okay, where were we?

394
00:17:31,970 --> 00:17:34,310
We were just about...

I'm sorry. Let me just
make sure he's okay.

401
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:56,850
Is he okay?

402
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:00,600
Yeah.

403
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:02,260

Hey, I'm thirsty.
Are you thirsty?

now quit it.

witty and urbane.

418
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,770
Keep it up and she's going
to find you bloody and homeless.

419

You don't scare me, Charlie.

420
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,670
You need me to keep
Chelsea off your back.

421
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:44,980
That may be true,
but I don't need

422

Don't you dare hurt him!

427
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:56,880
Well, now,
that's entirely up to you.

428
00:18:56,950 --> 00:19:00,520

is in your hands.
