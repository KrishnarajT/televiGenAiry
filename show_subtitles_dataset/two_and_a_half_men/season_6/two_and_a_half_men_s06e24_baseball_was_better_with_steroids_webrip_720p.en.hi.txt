A dark, desolate prairie.

00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:11,270
A lone cowboy sits
on a sturdy horse,

gazing up at the moon.

00:00:12,970 --> 00:00:16,180
Suddenly, a flash of light

8
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:19,350

All right.

19
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:52,700
Now we're cooking.

20
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:54,640
Alan?

00:00:54,710 --> 00:00:55,780
Mia?

22
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:57,670
I thought that was you.

23
00:00:57,750 --> 00:00:59,490
What a nice surprise.

24
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:01,860
Uh, didn't you move back
to New York with your husband?

25
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:04,290
We did, but then we split
up, and I came back here.

26
00:01:04,350 --> 00:01:05,550
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

27
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:07,180
I mean, not that you moved
back here,

28
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:08,230
but that it didn't work out.

29
00:01:08,290 --> 00:01:10,250
So, how's Charlie doing?

30
00:01:10,330 --> 00:01:11,570
Oh, he's fine.
Uh, actually,

31
00:01:11,630 --> 00:01:13,200
he's engaged,
if you can believe that.

32
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:14,390
You're kidding.

33
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:16,190
No, no, she moved in
and everything.

34
00:01:16,270 --> 00:01:17,670
Good for him.
Hmm!

35
00:01:17,730 --> 00:01:19,030
So, where are
you living now?

36
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:19,930
What do you mean?

37
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,570
You know,

38
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:24,140
since Charlie's fiancée
moved in, I assumed...

39
00:01:25,010 --> 00:01:26,910
You look great, Alan.

40
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:28,580
Thank you— you, too.

41
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:31,070

up for me, Dad.

No.

72
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:09,250
Lauren Conrad?
No.

73
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:10,810
Sean "P. Diddy"
Combs?

74
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:12,450
What is wrong with you?

75
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,980
No, I ran into Mia
at the coffee shop.

76
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:17,610
You're kidding.

77
00:03:17,690 --> 00:03:20,230
No, uh, apparently,
she's single again

78
00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:21,900
and, uh, living in L.A.

79
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:23,960
What's wrong
with you?

80
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:27,930
So...

81
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,070
Mia.

82
00:03:29,130 --> 00:03:30,160
How did she look?

83
00:03:30,230 --> 00:03:31,560
Oh, better than ever.

84
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:34,760
Damn.

85
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:35,840
What did she say?

86
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:38,940
Uh, she said to
give you her best.

87
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:40,180
That's it?

88
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,470
Pretty much.

89
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:43,710
How did she say it?
What do you mean?

90
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:47,990
I mean, was it perfunctory
or was there subtext?

91
00:03:48,050 --> 00:03:49,960
"Perfunctory."

92
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:54,030
That could be my rap name.

93
00:03:54,090 --> 00:03:56,430
MC Perfunctory.

94
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,690
I don't know.

95
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,220
Um...

96
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:03,040
but I-I mentioned
that you were engaged,

97
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:04,540
and, uh, she seemed happy
for you.

98
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:06,310
You told her I was engaged?

99
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:08,240
Why the hell would you do that?

100
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:10,630
Because you are,
in fact, engaged.

101
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:12,080
And she seemed happy
about that?

102
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:13,400
Yeah, she said,
"Good for him."

103
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:15,180
How did she say it?

104
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:17,040
Was it perfunctory?

105
00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:21,390
Or were there subtitles?

106
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:24,350
I'm leaving.

107
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:28,290
And yet the memory of him
lingers on.

108
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:30,130
Hey, Uncle Charlie.
Yeah?

109
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:31,520
Love you. (smacks lips)

110
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,700
To think I fought
for shared custody.

111
00:04:36,770 --> 00:04:38,970
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
so... so back to Mia.

112
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:40,260
Oh, don't tell me

113
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:41,580
you're still carrying
a torch for her.

114
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:44,580
No, I'm not carrying
a torch for her.

115
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:46,650
Why, do you think
she's carrying a torch for me?

116
00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:49,450
Charlie, you are engaged
to a wonderful woman.

117
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:51,010
Just forget about Mia.

118
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:53,120
I had forgotten about her.

119
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:55,410
I had forgotten
about her face...

120
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:56,850
her eyes...

121
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:58,390
her lips, her legs.

122
00:04:58,450 --> 00:05:01,220
Oh, God, those legs.

123
00:05:01,290 --> 00:05:03,230
You're the one
who brought her up.

124
00:05:03,290 --> 00:05:04,950
Sorry.

125
00:05:05,030 --> 00:05:06,600
Look, I'm the last one
to tell you

126
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:08,190
you can't have feelings
for an old girlfriend.

127
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:11,360
I mean, I myself still have very
strong feelings for Melissa.

128
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:13,000
Who's Melissa?

129
00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:14,370
My receptionist.

130
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:16,110
Oh, right.

131
00:05:16,170 --> 00:05:19,140
The one that caught you
in bed with her mom.

132
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:20,910
Uh, you're
leaving out a lot

133
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:23,450
of extenuating
circumstances, but...

134
00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:25,340
yes, she caught me
rubbing against her mother.

135
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:28,520
And you want to compare
that freak show

136
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:30,480
to what Mia and I had?

137
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:32,020
I almost married her.

138
00:05:32,090 --> 00:05:33,260
All I'm saying is,

139
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:35,520
you can acknowledge
your feelings for Mia

140
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:37,890
while still moving forward
with Chelsea.

141
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:39,600
That's exactly what
I intend to do.

142
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:41,120
Good.
It is good.

143
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:50,870
You're thinking about sex
with Mia, aren't you?

144
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:53,550
You're thinking about sex
with Melissa, aren't you?

145
00:05:53,610 --> 00:05:57,020

this report's due tomorrow.

All right.

165
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:51,900
I guess our relationship
is getting to that mature,

166
00:06:51,970 --> 00:06:54,010
evolved stage they talk about.

167
00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:55,070
Guess so.

00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:02,140

174
00:07:04,910 --> 00:07:06,280
Remember when you used
to close the door

175
00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:07,450
and tried to hit the porcelain

176
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,160
so I didn't have
to hear you pee?

177
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:13,290

to have sex after Sportscenter.

Uh, hang on.

00:07:25,170 --> 00:07:27,710

named Mia on the phone.

00:07:32,610 --> 00:07:34,250
Should I take a message?

186
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:35,620
No, no, no.

187
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:38,550
(toilet flushing)

188
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:43,510
Hello.

189
00:07:43,590 --> 00:07:45,320
Oh, hey, Mia.

190
00:07:45,390 --> 00:07:46,790
What a surprise.

191
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:49,560
Yeah, Alan mentioned
he ran into you.

192
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:52,900
Old friend.

193
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:55,260
Yes, yes, you heard correctly.

194
00:07:55,330 --> 00:07:57,570
I am engaged.

195
00:07:57,630 --> 00:07:59,460
Thank you.

196
00:07:59,530 --> 00:08:02,500
Yes, that was her.

197
00:08:02,570 --> 00:08:04,830
Oh, she's terrific.

198
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:08,950
And how are you?

199
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:12,510
Oh, I'm sorry
to hear that.

200
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:15,550
Well, there's plenty
more fish in the sea.

201
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:17,290
And I'm sure you'll
get out there

202
00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:20,150
in that old dating pond
and catch something.

203
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:25,690
You know, a-a-a fish,
not a disease.

204
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:29,490
Anyway, thanks for
the good wishes.

205
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:31,560
Bye-bye.

206
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:38,880
Okay, well, good night.

207
00:08:41,010 --> 00:08:42,350
Old friend, huh?

208
00:08:42,410 --> 00:08:43,610
Yeah.

209
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:45,320
She heard I was engaged

210
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:47,150
and wanted to
congratulate me.

211
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:48,720
Sweet kid.

212
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:51,410
Is this the woman
you almost married in Vegas

213
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:53,260
a few years ago?

214
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:56,490
Charlie?

215
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:59,030
I'm thinking.

216
00:08:59,090 --> 00:09:00,720
Charlie.

217
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:03,740
Who told you
about that?
Your brother.

218
00:09:04,630 --> 00:09:05,860
Oh, really?

219
00:09:05,930 --> 00:09:08,430
Did he tell you his
last girlfriend

220
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:09,970
caught him in bed
with her mother?

221
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:11,610
Yes, he did.

222
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:13,950
What a dirtbag, huh?

223
00:09:16,810 --> 00:09:19,540
So, were you ever going
to tell me about Mia?

224
00:09:19,610 --> 00:09:21,850
What's the point?

225
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:25,360
Have you told me about every guy
you've ever been with?

226
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:26,690
Actually, I have.

227
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:28,060
My boyfriend
in high school,

228
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:30,220
two guys in college
and the man I married.

229
00:09:30,290 --> 00:09:31,820
That's it— four?

230
00:09:31,890 --> 00:09:34,890
Back in your day, that
was a slow weekend, right?

231
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:40,060
It's not a competition, Chels.

232
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:43,830
So, why do you
think this Mia

233
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:45,850
is calling you
in the middle of the night?

234
00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:48,850
Honey, it was
perfectly innocent.

235
00:09:48,910 --> 00:09:50,310
She just called

236
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:52,990
to congratulate me
on our engagement.

237
00:09:57,820 --> 00:09:59,030
No, she didn't.

238
00:09:59,090 --> 00:10:00,860
She called to see
if you're happy.

239
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:02,850
She wants to know
if you're still available.

240
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:05,190
Really, you think so?

241
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:10,130
I mean...

242
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,200
Really, you think so?

243
00:10:11,270 --> 00:10:12,940
Yes, I think so.

244
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,330
The question is:
are you happy?

245
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:16,430
Are you available?

246
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:17,570
Oh, come on, Chels.

247
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:19,150
What kind of
question is that?

248
00:10:19,210 --> 00:10:23,220
No, I'm not available, and
I'm certainly not happy.

249
00:10:25,610 --> 00:10:27,080
You know what I mean.

250
00:10:27,150 --> 00:10:28,590
I hope so.

251
00:10:28,650 --> 00:10:30,090
Yep.

252
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:33,650
I'm a happy
and lucky man.

253
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:35,820
Happy, happy, happy.

254
00:10:35,890 --> 00:10:38,920
Lucky, lucky, lucky.

255
00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:42,140
And wet.

256
00:10:44,770 --> 00:10:46,670
I'm kind of wet.

258
00:10:52,010 --> 00:10:53,510
What you writing?

259
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:54,640
A screenplay.

260
00:10:54,710 --> 00:10:56,250
Cool.

261
00:10:56,310 --> 00:10:58,840
Hey, I got a great idea for
a movie if you want it.

262
00:10:58,910 --> 00:11:00,940
Thanks— I'm okay.

263
00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:05,460
What is it?

264
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:08,530
Okay. So there's this
guy who's in an accident

265
00:11:08,590 --> 00:11:11,100
on the highway, where he hits
like a moose or something.

266
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:12,400
And he loses
control of his car

267
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:14,790
and crashes into a truck
full of toxic waste.

268
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:16,590
And when he wakes
up in the hospital,

269
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:18,730
he's part car
and part animal.

270
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:23,070
Car-nimal.

271
00:11:24,370 --> 00:11:26,740
Um... thanks, but I think
I'll stick with my idea.

272
00:11:26,810 --> 00:11:28,650
Fine— what's your idea?

273
00:11:28,710 --> 00:11:29,280
You really interested?

274
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:30,540
Sure.

275
00:11:30,610 --> 00:11:32,880
Well, it's, uh...
it's about a man,

276
00:11:32,950 --> 00:11:35,490
uh, who's at a crossroads
in his life,

277
00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:37,520
uh, coming to terms
with, uh, loss

278
00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:38,590
and... and mortality.

279
00:11:38,650 --> 00:11:40,180
Huh.

280
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:42,290
You know what you
could call it?
What?

281
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:44,160
Boring.

282
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:47,370
Thank you.

283
00:11:47,430 --> 00:11:50,840

00:11:57,670 --> 00:11:58,700
Hey, Charlie.
Hey, Herb.

286
00:11:58,770 --> 00:12:00,270
I'm here to pick up Jake.

287
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:01,810
Oh, come on in.

288
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:04,880
Jake, time to get the
hell out of my house!

289
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:08,640
So, how's it going?

290
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:09,720
Oh, pretty good.

291
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:11,110
Baby's coming any day now.

292
00:12:11,190 --> 00:12:12,730
Judith's got that
glow of motherhood.

293
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:15,390
Gangway, I gotta
freakin' pee again.

294
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:24,200
Yeah, she's radiant.

295
00:12:24,970 --> 00:12:26,040
Hey, Herb.

296
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:27,460
Jake's just finishing breakfast.

297
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:29,910
Or he could be starting lunch.

298
00:12:29,970 --> 00:12:31,100
It's a fine line.

299
00:12:31,170 --> 00:12:32,770
Well, he is a growing boy.

300
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:35,570
He's a growing
pain in my ass.

301
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:37,970
He says that with love.

302
00:12:38,050 --> 00:12:41,960
No, I say it with a dull,
throbbing pain in my ass.

303
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:44,090
JUDITH:
Uh-oh.

304
00:12:44,150 --> 00:12:46,550
What's the matter?
My water just broke.

305
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:48,420
Are you sure?

306
00:12:48,490 --> 00:12:51,100
(yelling)

307
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:56,290
Yes, I'm sure.

308
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:01,100
I ain't cleaning that up.

Shut up.

Slipping in Judith's
amniotic fluid.

00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:16,810
Guess this'll be
pretty funny someday.

315
00:13:16,890 --> 00:13:19,290
It's pretty funny
right now, Herb.

00:13:19,350 --> 00:13:21,990
Hello?
A little help here!

you doing here?

321
00:13:29,030 --> 00:13:30,360
I work here.

322
00:13:30,430 --> 00:13:35,430
I had to find another job
after... You know.

323
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:39,800
For the last time, I did not
have sex with your mother!

324
00:13:39,870 --> 00:13:42,170
Excuse me, I'm having
a baby here!

325
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:43,540
Yeah, and I think
I broke my ankle.

326
00:13:43,610 --> 00:13:44,840
Quit whining, Herb!

327
00:13:44,910 --> 00:13:46,310
Her doctor's
on his way.

328
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:47,880
The contractions are
about eight minutes apart.

329
00:13:47,950 --> 00:13:49,620
Oh, well, let's
get you to prenatal.

330
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:51,950
I'll sign you in and have
an orderly take you upstairs.

331
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:53,150
No. No, No, no.

332
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:55,320
I'm the father.
I'll do it.

333
00:13:55,390 --> 00:13:56,500
Bad idea, Herb.

334
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:58,460
I'm here, Judith.
Everything's okay.

335
00:13:58,530 --> 00:13:59,330
Oh.

00:13:59,390 --> 00:14:01,760

Oh!
Whoa!

337
00:14:01,830 --> 00:14:03,900
God.

00:14:05,830 --> 00:14:07,960
I'm coming, Judith!

340
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:11,500
Stay down, champ.

341
00:14:11,570 --> 00:14:13,970
It's not your night.

342
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:16,610
Oh, my freaking God!

343
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:17,750
Now, you're not
breathing.

344
00:14:17,810 --> 00:14:18,770
You got to
remember to breathe.

345
00:14:18,850 --> 00:14:20,850
Good, good, good.

346
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:22,860
Okay. Now, you're only
two minutes apart.

347
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:24,290
So we're in the
homestretch here.

00:14:24,350 --> 00:14:25,280
Great.

00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:26,820
Boy...

350
00:14:26,890 --> 00:14:29,360
It seems like just yesterday
we were at this same hospital

351
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:30,690
waiting for little Jake
to arrive.

352
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:32,970
Uh-huh.

353
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:35,030
I guess after pushing out
his enormous head,

354
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:37,870
this one will feel like spitting
a watermelon seed.

355
00:14:37,930 --> 00:14:39,930
(moaning)

356
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,170
So anyway, I really
love my fiancée,

357
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:49,080
but I can't get this
other girl out of my mind.

358
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:52,680
I mean, she told my brother
to give me her best.

359
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:54,450
And let me tell ya,
her best

360
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:58,320
could curl your hair
and make your ass whistle.

361
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,050
Is that what
you're here for?

362
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:04,390
A whistling ass?

363
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:06,100
No-no, no.

364
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,990
There's a baby
and some broken bones.

365
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:09,990
Not important.

366
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:12,100
The thing is,

367
00:15:12,170 --> 00:15:14,370
I know you can't expect
to keep the passion

368
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:16,640
of a new relationship
going forever,

369
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:18,300
but I kind of miss it.

370
00:15:18,370 --> 00:15:20,370
Maybe it's just
that the grass

371
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:22,010
always looks greener,
you know?

372
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:24,280
You see this cooler?

373
00:15:24,350 --> 00:15:25,720
Yeah.

374
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:27,190
It's carrying two light beers,

375
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:29,720
a half a ham sandwich
and my thumb.

376
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:36,220
So you'll excuse
me if I lack

377
00:15:36,290 --> 00:15:39,420
a certain degree of interest
in your romantic dilemma.

378
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:44,570
You got beer?

379
00:15:46,130 --> 00:15:47,700
Oh, God! Oh, God!
Now, focus on me.

380
00:15:47,770 --> 00:15:49,380
Remember your breathing.

381
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,280
One, two, one,

382
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:53,610
two, one...
Dr. Harper?

383
00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:56,670
Melissa.

384
00:15:56,740 --> 00:15:58,210
I miss you.

385
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:00,550
Oh, I miss you, too.

386
00:16:00,610 --> 00:16:02,280
Can we talk?

387
00:16:02,350 --> 00:16:04,710
Of course.

388
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:05,560
Alan!

389
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:09,600
You're fine.
Just keep breathing.

390
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:12,600
Hey, Charlie!

391
00:16:13,530 --> 00:16:15,930
Look at me.

392
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,340
I'm half man,
half machine.

393
00:16:19,830 --> 00:16:22,030
Kind of like
Jake's movie idea.

394
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:24,630
Car-nimal!

395
00:16:25,770 --> 00:16:27,000
It's okay, dude.

396
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:29,080
I'm going to hang here
for a while.

397
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:33,110
I love that guy!

398
00:16:34,450 --> 00:16:36,060
What the hell
did they give you?

399
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:38,320
Oh, the good stuff.

400
00:16:38,390 --> 00:16:40,190
You could pull out
every one of my teeth,

401
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:42,750
I wouldn't even notice.

402
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:45,190
They didn't, did they?

403
00:16:48,030 --> 00:16:49,970
You're fine.

404
00:16:50,030 --> 00:16:51,360
Okay, then.

405
00:16:51,430 --> 00:16:52,800
Guess we should get going.

406
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:54,870
You drive, okay?
I'm pretty buzzed.

407
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:56,780
What about Judith?

408
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:57,840
No, let's not bring her.

409
00:16:57,910 --> 00:16:59,750
She's a downer.

410
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,870
No argument,
but there is the baby.

411
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:06,580
Oh, my God... the baby!

412
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:09,020
Judith needs me.

413
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:10,310
I must go to her.

414
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:13,520
I'm coming, Judith!

415
00:17:13,590 --> 00:17:15,530
I'm coming!

416
00:17:18,730 --> 00:17:21,670
Hey, Charlie,
how'd you get here so quick?

417
00:17:26,770 --> 00:17:28,070
Oh, I tried to forget you.

418
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:29,810
To hate you.

419
00:17:29,870 --> 00:17:32,000
But I couldn't.

420
00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:33,400
Really?

421
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:34,840
Most people don't have
that problem.

422
00:17:38,710 --> 00:17:40,080
Beer and chips.

423
00:17:40,150 --> 00:17:42,220
This is turning out okay.

424
00:17:44,650 --> 00:17:46,420
Did you see where
my friend went?

425
00:17:46,490 --> 00:17:50,100
He went hobbling down the hall,
mumbling about some Judith.

426
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:53,170
I better go warn
the villagers.

427
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:56,590
Good luck to you.

428
00:17:57,630 --> 00:18:00,230
Thanks.
Oh, and hey.

429
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:09,710
Good luck to you, too.

430
00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:14,620
(moaning, screaming)

431
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:16,180
Oh... God!

432
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:18,310
Oh... oh...

433
00:18:18,390 --> 00:18:20,130
Oh...

434
00:18:20,190 --> 00:18:22,300
Oh, there you are.

435
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:24,800
You seen Herb?

436
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:27,000
No, I haven't seen Herb!

437
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:28,460
Huh.

438
00:18:28,530 --> 00:18:29,440
Chips?

439
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:32,570
No, I don't want any chips!

440
00:18:32,630 --> 00:18:34,300
Okay.

441
00:18:34,370 --> 00:18:36,610
I don't think
you're supposed to have beer.

442
00:18:36,670 --> 00:18:37,930
Get out of here!

443
00:18:38,010 --> 00:18:40,010
No problem.

444
00:18:40,070 --> 00:18:42,310
Wait! Don't leave me!

445
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:46,490
I need someone to coach me
through my contractions.

446
00:18:46,550 --> 00:18:48,220
All right.

447
00:18:51,590 --> 00:18:54,990
(screaming)

448
00:18:55,060 --> 00:18:57,460
Uh...

449
00:18:58,290 --> 00:19:00,560
Way to go.

450
00:19:02,430 --> 00:19:04,030
HERB:
Judith!

451
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:05,470
I'm coming!

452
00:19:06,870 --> 00:19:09,780
See, I love Chelsea,

453
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:12,450
but you know, there
was a time I loved Mia.

454
00:19:12,510 --> 00:19:16,680
(screaming
and panting)

455
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:18,670
Breathe.

456
00:19:19,910 --> 00:19:22,780
All right, you're fully dilated.

457
00:19:22,850 --> 00:19:24,950
I think it's time
to have this baby.

458
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:28,760
Okay, well...
good luck.

459
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:30,690
Don't you dare leave me!

460
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:32,430

461
00:19:32,490 --> 00:19:34,760
Judith, I'm here! Oh!

462
00:19:36,730 --> 00:19:38,790
Whoopsie.

463
00:19:38,870 --> 00:19:40,770
Think I broke my nose.

464
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:44,540
Three cheers for Demerol.

465

An unconventionally handsome
man looks down upon the baby

471

that might be his,

So you're not against maybe
having one of your own someday?

484

I don't see why not.

485
00:20:42,630 --> 00:20:44,090
Turns out, I like babies.
