Keep it up, funny man.

You're going to be homeless,
wearing a tube top

00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:17,420
I've fallen in love
with Chelsea.

Oh. Well, why are you so upset?

And we're back

00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:31,190
Last night, in bed,

50
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:32,240
I told her I loved her.

51
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:33,800
And you know what she said?

52
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:37,310
Uh... "I'm still not going
to let you do that"?

53
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:46,080
She said, "Thank you."

54
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:49,560
Ooh, that's an ice cube
to the man sack.

55
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:53,860
I don't get it.

56
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:57,290
I've gone the whole nine yards
for this relationship.

57
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,770
I gave her her own drawer
in my bedroom.

58
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:01,970
I stopped smoking cigars
after sex.

59
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:04,000
I even started seeing a shrink
so I can be more sensitive,

60
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:06,230
and I still can't get a freaking
"I love you."

61
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:09,370
But you've obviously
become more sensitive.

62
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:11,770
For what I've spent on therapy,

63
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,680
I could get a couple
of very expensive hookers

64
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:16,200
who will say anything I want.

65
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:19,420
There's that sensitivity again.

66
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:20,940
Look at the bright side.

67
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:22,450
What's the bright side?

68
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:24,460
Well, when women do tell you
they love you,

69
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:26,430
it usually ends with them
tossing a lit road flare

70
00:03:26,490 --> 00:03:27,960
through your bedroom window.

71
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:31,930
That happened one time.

72
00:03:31,990 --> 00:03:33,690
Why can't you just be grateful
for what you've got?

73
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:34,920
What do I got?

74
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,370
Oh, a woman who may not proclaim
her love for you,

75
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:39,060
but who doesn't try
to set you on fire

76
00:03:39,130 --> 00:03:40,160
while you're sleeping.

77
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:42,570
One time.

78
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,010
Okay.

79
00:03:44,070 --> 00:03:46,300
A woman who may not
proclaim her love for you,

80
00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:47,570
but who doesn't steal
your Mercedes

81

in the backseat

82
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:51,350

into the Pacific Ocean.

83
00:03:51,410 --> 00:03:54,540

I'm sorry, Alan.

86
00:03:59,490 --> 00:04:02,460
But not being drowned or burned
by the woman I love

87
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,820
is not enough for me.

88
00:04:03,890 --> 00:04:06,520

Hey,

109

last night I dreamt
I was a giant hot dog

110
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:04,550
jumping through a doughnut
that looked like my mother.

111

All right, Charlie,
you've made your point.

00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:10,520
Now, tell me what happened.

114
00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:12,490
We can go back to the doughnut
dream later.

115
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,690
It wasn't a real dream.

116
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:14,960
I was being sarcastic.

117
00:05:15,030 --> 00:05:16,570
Oh, I know, but the fact
that you chose

118
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:18,860
that particular imagery
is a little troubling.

119
00:05:19,970 --> 00:05:21,640
Now, what happened
with Chelsea?

120
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:24,700
I told her I loved her,
and you know what she said?

121
00:05:24,770 --> 00:05:27,900
This process isn't really about
me guessing, Charlie.

122
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:31,810
She said, "Thank you."

123
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:33,450
Interesting.

124
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:34,740
How did that make you feel?

125
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:37,220
No, no, no, no, no!
No more feelings.

126
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,680
We tried it your way.

127
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:40,250
Now, just take out
your little prescription pad

128
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,620
and start scribbling.

130
00:05:43,790 --> 00:05:45,750
You're actually making
tremendous progress.

131
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:47,670
Are you not listening
to a thing I say?

132
00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:50,070
I drift in and out.

133
00:05:51,730 --> 00:05:53,600
Look, the fact that
you're upset about this

134
00:05:53,670 --> 00:05:55,470
tells me you've come
a long way from the guy

135
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:56,810
who first walked
into this office.

136
00:05:56,870 --> 00:05:59,700
The guy who first walked
into this office

137
00:05:59,770 --> 00:06:02,170
was a happy-go-lucky,
fully-functioning man whore

138
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,810
and I want him back.

139
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:06,120
I'm guessing
you don't mean that.

140
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:07,720
Oh, now you're guessing?

141
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:10,350
A minute ago it was, "That's not
how the process works."

142
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:11,860
A minute ago, it didn't.

143
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:16,750
So are you still seeing Chelsea?

144
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:19,790
Well, of course
I'm still seeing her,

145
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:22,960
but now the relationship's
totally screwed.

146
00:06:23,030 --> 00:06:23,790
Why is that?

147
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:25,460
She knows I love her.

148
00:06:25,530 --> 00:06:28,730
The whole balance of power
is completely out of whack.

149
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,230
Huh.

150
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:34,140
Okay, I really don't like it
when you give me the "huh."

151
00:06:34,210 --> 00:06:36,010
Huh.

152
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,020
Now, you're just
screwing with me, right?

153
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:40,590
There's no sliding
anything past you.

154
00:06:42,450 --> 00:06:45,990
So let's talk about
this whole balance of power

155
00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:47,850
issue of yours.
What about it?

156
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:50,790
Why do you look at relationships
as a power struggle?

157
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:52,900
'Cause that's what they are.

158
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,720
Is that how you saw
your parents' relationship,

159
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:55,800
as a power struggle?

160
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:57,360
Oh, there was no struggle.

161
00:06:57,430 --> 00:06:58,960
My father sat very quietly

162
00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:01,100
while my mother
sucked the life out of him.

163
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:04,940
I see, and you're terrified
of that happening to you.

164
00:07:05,010 --> 00:07:07,580
No, I'm looking forward to it.

165
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:09,880
In fact,
I'm thinking about having

166
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:11,110
a nozzle attached to my heart

167
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:13,590
to make the sucking
more convenient.

168
00:07:13,650 --> 00:07:15,790
Let me ask you something.

169
00:07:15,850 --> 00:07:17,160
What would it take for you feel

170
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:19,660
that things were back in balance
with Chelsea?

171
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:22,250
Simple. She has to tell me
she loves me.

172
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:23,590
Even if she doesn't feel it?

173
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:26,300
It's even better if she
doesn't feel it.

174
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,270
'Cause that means
she's only saying it

175
00:07:29,330 --> 00:07:32,270
'cause she's afraid to lose me.

176
00:07:32,330 --> 00:07:33,960
Wow.

177
00:07:34,030 --> 00:07:35,330
"Wow"?

178
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:36,830
What's "wow"?

179
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:40,100
Kind of like "huh,"
but with a "wuh" and an "ow."

180
00:07:42,810 --> 00:07:45,010
Charlie, I would suggest
that you forget about

181
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:47,090
getting the "I love you" back
and focus more

182
00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:49,150
on what it feels like
to give love,

183
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:51,660
maybe for the first time
in your life.

184
00:07:53,690 --> 00:07:56,660
You know, I can get the drugs
without you.

185
00:07:58,190 --> 00:08:00,260
I've got a nephew
in junior high.

186
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:04,630
Do what you got to do.

187
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:08,170

mom-shaped doughnut of yours.

189
00:08:13,210 --> 00:08:15,450

you loved her?

190
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:17,250
Yeah.

191
00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:18,710
Were you loaded?

192
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:21,080
No.

193
00:08:21,150 --> 00:08:23,220
Were you trying to get her to do
something kinky?

194
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:25,720
No.

195
00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:27,430

something kinky

197
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:31,720
No.

00:08:31,790 --> 00:08:33,420

00:08:33,490 --> 00:08:34,820
No.

200
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:36,470
Then I don't get it.

201
00:08:36,530 --> 00:08:37,470
What was your angle?

202
00:08:37,530 --> 00:08:40,260
My angle was I love her.

203
00:08:40,330 --> 00:08:42,300
Huh.

204
00:08:42,370 --> 00:08:43,580
Why does everybody go "huh"?

205
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:45,280
What's with the "huh"?

206
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:47,350
We always knew
this day would come.

207
00:08:47,410 --> 00:08:48,810
What day?

208
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:51,950
The day you stopped manipulating
and conning women.

209
00:08:52,010 --> 00:08:53,680
The day you dropped your guard

210
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:55,790
and let an honest emotion
into your heart.

211
00:08:55,850 --> 00:08:57,490
Well, that's a good day, right?

212
00:08:57,550 --> 00:09:00,750
If you don't mind being
some broad's prison bitch.

213
00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:08,770
What are you going to do now?

214
00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:11,300
I don't know.

215
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,960
I can't keep seeing her,
'cause the relationship's

216
00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:14,530
completely out of balance,

217
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:17,030
and I can't stop seeing her
because I love her.

218
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:19,030
I feel for you.

219
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:21,450
I once loved a guy,
didn't love me back.

220

What did you do?
90 days in County.

221
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:28,120
Plus anger management classes,

222
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:31,850
which by the way, are a total
freaking waste of time.

223
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:36,280

00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:42,390

What part of "ocupado"
don't you understand?

00:10:10,290 --> 00:10:13,320
The "ocu" or the "pado"?

00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:16,390

Well, I'm not!

239
00:10:17,970 --> 00:10:19,810

Are you serious?

00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:24,690
and I need you
to do something for me.

00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:26,360
Not a problem.

285
00:12:26,430 --> 00:12:28,630
I'll have the valet bring
your car around to the alley.

286
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:31,570
I'll open the men's restroom
window so you can shimmy out.

287
00:12:31,630 --> 00:12:33,960
And I'll have a cab standing by
to take the lady home

chocolate soufflé to go.

pour a glass for her
and a glass for me,

297
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:58,190
then distract her so I can slip
the ring into her glass.

00:12:58,260 --> 00:13:00,570
Oh, how charmingly original.

299
00:13:00,630 --> 00:13:02,600

Yes, you did.

309
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,420
You said, "Thank you."

310
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:25,610
You were very courteous.

311
00:13:25,690 --> 00:13:27,360
It's not that I don't have

312
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:29,350

it's just that

313
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:31,690
taking that extra step
is really hard for me.

00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:33,570
Well, don't worry about it.

did I just swallow?

00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:26,680
A one-bedroom condo.
What?

333
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:30,360
I put a diamond ring
in your champagne glass.

334
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:31,660
Why?

335
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:33,330
What do you mean "why?"

336
00:14:33,390 --> 00:14:35,660
I was going to propose
and I had no idea you'd chug it

337
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:37,150
like a Jell-O shot.

338
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:38,990

I just swallowed?

340
00:14:41,190 --> 00:14:42,560
I was thirsty.

Stop yelling at me!

342
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:46,790
How in God's name could you
swallow it so easily?

343
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:49,470
Hey, that's one of the things
you love about me!

344
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:52,180

345
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,810
No problem. Go away.

The emergency room.
Why?

350
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:03,150
Because I have a ring
in my stomach!

351
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:06,020
Oh, don't worry about that.
You'll be fine.

a handful of nickels.

Absolutely.

357
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:15,270
He still shoots one out
every now and then.

358
00:15:15,330 --> 00:15:17,040
Bets me heads or tails.

359
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,800
Just between you and me,

360
00:15:19,870 --> 00:15:22,070
I'm not even sure
they're the same nickels.

361
00:15:23,070 --> 00:15:24,700
Trust me.

362
00:15:25,970 --> 00:15:27,500
A couple cups of coffee
in the morning,

363
00:15:27,570 --> 00:15:28,740
problem solved.

364
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:31,510
I suppose you're right.

365
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:34,920
So, what do you say?

366
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:36,640
What do I say about what?

367
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:37,890
I asked you to marry me.

368
00:15:37,950 --> 00:15:39,380
No, you didn't.

369
00:15:39,450 --> 00:15:41,980
Well, I was about to
until you ruined the moment.

370
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:43,700
I ruined the moment?

371
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:46,430
Okay. Okay, there's no sense
in assigning blame.

372
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:50,340
The point is, I'm proposing.

373
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:53,810
You want to marry me.

374
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:55,610
Yes. I love you.

375
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:58,540
Oh... I don't know what to say.

376
00:15:58,610 --> 00:16:00,950
Say you love me
and you'll marry me.

377
00:16:01,010 --> 00:16:04,720
Gee, Charlie, you're kind
of putting me on the spot here.

378
00:16:04,780 --> 00:16:07,690
Yeah, well, that's kind of built
into the whole proposal concept.

379
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:10,980
Oh, come on, just say it
so we can be even.

380
00:16:11,050 --> 00:16:12,980
"Even"?

381
00:16:13,050 --> 00:16:14,320
Is that what this is about?

382
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:15,230
Some kind of power thing?

383
00:16:15,290 --> 00:16:16,790
N-no, no, no.

384
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:20,470
I meant so that
we could be even... closer.

385
00:16:20,530 --> 00:16:22,030
Right.

386
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:24,440
Okay, that was lame.

387
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:26,070
But don't blame me,
blame my shrink.

388
00:16:26,130 --> 00:16:28,360
What?
If I was properly medicated,

389
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:30,310
we wouldn't be having
this conversation.

390
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:34,100
Boy, this keeps getting
more and more romantic.

391
00:16:34,170 --> 00:16:36,900
Look, do you love me or not?

392
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:38,750
I guess so.

393
00:16:38,810 --> 00:16:40,040
No guessing.

394
00:16:40,110 --> 00:16:41,610
That's not how
the process works.

395
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:44,380
All right, I love you.

396
00:16:44,450 --> 00:16:46,750
Oh, great! Great, good.

397
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:47,930
That's all I wanted.

398
00:16:47,990 --> 00:16:49,360
But I won't marry you.

399
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:51,650
What? Oh, yeah, right.

400
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:53,560
That's okay, no biggie.

401
00:16:56,430 --> 00:16:58,340
I just got out of a marriage.

402
00:16:58,400 --> 00:16:59,600
I'm not ready to do it again.

403
00:16:59,670 --> 00:17:01,170
That's fine.
I understand.

404
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:02,730
I'm not saying "no,"

405
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,200
I'm just saying "not now."

406
00:17:04,270 --> 00:17:06,830
Hey, "not now" is
my favorite time for a wedding.

407
00:17:08,410 --> 00:17:11,380
The important thing
is that we love each other.

408
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:13,210
Right.
Equally.

409
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,210
Yes.
Fifty-fifty.

410
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:17,280
If it means that much to you.

411
00:17:17,350 --> 00:17:19,980
Come on, say it again.

412
00:17:20,050 --> 00:17:22,480
"I love you."

413
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:24,000
No.

414
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:25,100
Why not?

415
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:27,800
I want to see the ring first.

417
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:35,660
Hey, Berta?

00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:38,410
Where do we keep
the spaghetti strainer thingie?

419
00:17:39,870 --> 00:17:41,270
It's called a "colander."

420
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:42,640
What do you need it for?

421
00:17:42,710 --> 00:17:44,850
It's not for me.
It's for Chelsea.

422
00:17:46,610 --> 00:17:49,780
Okay, what kind
of Martha Stewart freak show

423
00:17:49,850 --> 00:17:51,390
you got going up there?

424
00:17:51,450 --> 00:17:53,550
Trust me, you don't need
the details.

425
00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:56,580
I don't want the details.

426
00:17:56,660 --> 00:17:58,560
I just need to know
whether to wash it

427
00:17:58,630 --> 00:18:00,630
or throw it away
when you're done.

428
00:18:00,690 --> 00:18:04,190
Oh, I think you'll want
to throw it away.

429
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:07,170
Morning.
Hey, Alan.

430
00:18:07,230 --> 00:18:08,430
Congratulate me.

431
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:09,800
I'm kind of engaged.

432
00:18:09,870 --> 00:18:11,710
So she said "yes"?

433
00:18:11,770 --> 00:18:13,240
Not exactly.

434
00:18:13,310 --> 00:18:14,450
You gave her the ring, right?

435
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:16,050
Yep.
Well, what did she say?

436
00:18:16,110 --> 00:18:18,620
(gagging)

437
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:21,820
You had to be there.

438
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:23,480
Okay.

439
00:18:23,550 --> 00:18:24,880
So, have you set a date?

440
00:18:24,950 --> 00:18:26,180
For what?

441
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:27,150
The wedding.

442
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:28,720
What wedding?

443
00:18:28,790 --> 00:18:30,660
Nobody's getting married.
I'm just engaged.

444
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:33,870
When do we get to see
this rock?

445
00:18:33,930 --> 00:18:37,400
Well, Chelsea just finished
her second cup of coffee,

446
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:40,230
so I'd guess...
15, 20 minutes.

447
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:45,210
Anybody understand
what that was all about?

448
00:18:45,270 --> 00:18:48,270
I think Chelsea
swallowed some nickels.

You've been in
there for awhile.

00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:06,390
I brought Alan's
little poop stool.

460
00:19:13,530 --> 00:19:15,830
when you hear
a metallic clink, stop.

461
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:18,030
I think I can
handle it.

462
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:20,340
I'm just saying, it's not
on my homeowner's policy yet,

463
00:19:20,410 --> 00:19:23,150
so if you flush it
by mistake, I'm screwed.

465
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:26,350
if you don't walk away
from that door,

466
00:19:26,410 --> 00:19:27,640
I will eat
a block of cheese

467
00:19:27,710 --> 00:19:29,640
and you will never
see that ring again!

468
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:33,620
Okay, I'm walking.
Good.

469
00:19:33,690 --> 00:19:35,030
