1
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:11,710
Thanks, Mom. This is
a perfect first job.

2
00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:13,220
First job?

3
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:15,780
I think you're looking
at a birth of a career.

4
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:21,310
I was going to have him
put up fliers,

5
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:23,520
but I didn't trust him
with a staple gun.

6
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:24,860
How much are you paying him?

7
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:27,720
Obviously, too much.
Look at him.

8
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:34,640
For the record, I promised him
$20 and a Playboy magazine.

9
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:36,670
Playboy?

10
00:00:36,730 --> 00:00:41,170
Don't worry. I'll Magic-Marker
over the ta-tas and hoo-hoos.

11
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:44,580
Oh, that's disturbing
on so many levels.

12
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,740
(ice cream truck playing music)

13
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:55,410
I should've hired a monkey.

14
00:00:55,490 --> 00:00:59,730
You mean a
different monkey.

15
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:12,030
Well, it's not really
a paycheck,

16
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:13,870
and he's not really earning it

17
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:16,010
and we don't call him...

18
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:17,900
I guess I got to
give you Jughead.

19
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:19,650
I remember my first job.

20
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:21,350
Slaughterhouse.

21
00:01:21,410 --> 00:01:24,080
Strippin' out sheep intestines
for the condom companies.

22
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:31,050
Not as sexy as it sounds.

23
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:33,120
I was a fluffer in a pet salon.

24
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:36,960
You know, with a blow dryer.

25
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:39,270
Huh. I was going a completely
different way.

26
00:01:42,830 --> 00:01:43,730
What are you doing?

27
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:45,100
Thanks to Grandma,

28
00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:47,940
I'm reading an interview
with Jimmy Kimmel.

29
00:01:48,010 --> 00:01:50,580
Hey, Alan, you got any cash?

30
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:51,740
Yeah. Why?

31
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:53,250
I need to borrow some.

32
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:53,940
What for?

33
00:01:54,010 --> 00:01:55,470
What are you, my mother?

34
00:01:55,550 --> 00:01:58,620
Just give me a few bucks,
save me a trip to the ATM.

35
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,310
When will I get it back?

36
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:02,050
I don't know. Tomorrow.

37
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:04,290
Okay, how much
do you need?

38
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:05,380
Just a couple hundred.

39
00:02:06,890 --> 00:02:08,120
A couple hundred?

40
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:09,960
Who carries around
that kind of money?

41
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:11,470
Well, let's see...

42
00:02:11,530 --> 00:02:13,100
Strippers, bookies,
prostitutes,

43
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:16,360
and not entirely
coincidentally— me.

44
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:21,200
Well, I've only got...
35, 36... $38.

45
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:22,370
That's it?

46
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:25,100
That's your walking around
money?

47
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:27,780
It's the perfect amount
in case I get mugged.

48
00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:29,150
See, not so little
that my attacker

49
00:02:29,210 --> 00:02:30,610
will get angry and try
and pistol-whip me,

50
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:33,080
yet not so much that I would
feel obliged to fight for it

51
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:35,280
and possibly be shot
while wrestling for the gun.

52
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:40,690
So you got $38.

53
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:42,060
Yep.

54
00:02:42,130 --> 00:02:44,270
Just out of curiosity,
how much money would it take

55
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:46,300
for you to wrestle
a gun from a mugger?

56
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:49,590
Assuming a small- to medium-
sized mugger, at least $40.

57
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:52,670
Fine, so, give me the $38.

58
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:54,010
All of it?

59
00:02:54,070 --> 00:02:55,530
Why not?
Then I've got nothing.

60
00:02:55,610 --> 00:02:58,480
And you think $38 changes that?

61
00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:01,410
What if I decide to go out
and have some fun?

62
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:04,120
$38 worth of fun?

63
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:07,550
I wouldn't spend
all of it.

64
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:09,930
Okay, okay, look, you're
not going out to have fun.

65
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:12,430
You never go out to have fun,
because you know why?

66
00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:13,560
You're not a fun guy.

67
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:16,350
Oh, I am very much a fun guy.

68
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:18,430
We just have different
definitions of fun,

69
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:20,570
and mine doesn't include
urinary tract infections

70
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:22,230
and dry heaving.

71
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:26,260
Just give me the money,
ya big fruit.

72
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:28,940
$38...

73
00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:32,610
If it had been $40,
we'd be wrestling, my friend!

74
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,850
ALAN:
Hey, Charlie?

75
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,620
You got my money?

76
00:03:53,330 --> 00:03:54,030
Charlie!

77
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:55,540
I'm trying to sleep, Alan.

78
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,810
Yeah, well, I've got
to go to work and you said

79
00:03:57,870 --> 00:04:00,480
you'd have my money.
Oh, for God's sake.

80
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:02,540
You don't even have to get up.
Just tell me where it is.

81
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:06,250
Well, the last I saw any of it,
it was sandwiched between

82
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:08,250
two of the loveliest
man-made breasts

83
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:11,510
that ever smacked me in the eye.

84
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:14,250
Oh, Charlie, you say
the sweetest things.

85
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:16,620
Oh, Ginger, this is
my brother Alan.

86
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:17,730
Alan, Ginger.

87
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:19,390
Hi.

88
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:20,460
Hi.

89
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:22,220
So bottom line,
you don't have my money?

90
00:04:22,290 --> 00:04:23,360
No.

91
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:25,400
The money you promised
to pay back today?

92
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:26,930
The day hasn't
even started yet.

93
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
It started for me.

94
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:29,300
That's only because

95
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:31,240
you're on Douchebag
Savings Time.

96
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,100
Can we please talk about this

97
00:04:34,170 --> 00:04:36,170
when one of us doesn't
have a warm, firm buttock

98
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,280
nestled against his groin?

99
00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:39,950
Oh, dear Lord.

100
00:04:40,010 --> 00:04:41,510
So you'll get it by tonight?

101
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:44,290
I'm hopin' to get it
as soon as you close the door.

102
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:49,860
Are you really out of cash?

103
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:52,660
Don't worry. I've
got hooker money.

104
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:04,130
(plays piano):
♪ When you're hungry at school

105
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,960
♪ You need to know

106
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:09,240
♪ Paste yes, boogers no.

107
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:15,070
Hey.

108
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:17,220
How was your day, darling?

109
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,240
Fine, except I had
to pay for lunch

110
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:21,490
with my lucky Sacagawea dollar.

111
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:24,220
What kind of lunch
can you get for a dollar?

112
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:26,390
Two gas station hot dogs
that were a year old

113
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:28,860
if they were a day,
thank you very much.

114
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:31,330
Is Sacagawea
the same Indian chick

115
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:32,790
that's on the
Land O'Lakes butter?

116
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:35,730
I don't know.

117
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,070
I hope so.

118
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:40,410
I'd like to believe it is.

119
00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:44,710
Okay, Charlie, I'm leaving.

120
00:05:44,770 --> 00:05:46,500
Hang on. Let me pay you.

121
00:05:50,010 --> 00:05:51,380
Here you go.

122
00:05:51,450 --> 00:05:54,160
Did you forget I paid for
that pizza the other night?

123
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:56,490
Oh, right. How much was that?

124
00:05:56,550 --> 00:06:01,720
Well, you got the garlic balls
too, so, say... 75 bucks.

125
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:04,560
You got change for a hundred?

126
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:05,400
Nope.

127
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:07,360
Okay, you'll pay me back.

128
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:09,030
Count on it.

129
00:06:12,570 --> 00:06:14,740
Wait, wait, wait,
as long as you're doling it out,

130
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,030
you got my 40 bucks?

131
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:18,080
Oh, sure. You got change
for a hundred?

132
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:20,000
Nope.
Okay, I'll catch you later.

133
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,720
Wait...

134
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:24,690
How come Berta can pay you back
and I can't?

135
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:26,050
Oh, grow up.

136
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,690
She's not gonna
pay me back.

137
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:29,550
Okay, then, what about me?

138
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:30,560
What about you?

139
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:31,980
I want my $40.

140
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:34,300
I only borrowed $38.

141
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:37,130
Yeah, well, I find round numbers
easier to remember.

142
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:38,760
Oh, you like round numbers,
do you?

143
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:40,600
Yes, I like round numbers.

144
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:42,690
Okay, here's a round number
for you.

145
00:06:42,770 --> 00:06:43,770
Zero.

146
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:47,540
Nice, tight circular shape.

147
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,930
Nothing gets in,
nothing gets out.

148
00:06:49,010 --> 00:06:50,110
Sound familiar, Alan?

149
00:06:50,170 --> 00:06:53,000
Are you calling me anal?

150
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:56,250
That's right.
A-L-A-N, anal.

151
00:06:56,310 --> 00:06:57,940
Okay, okay, okay.

152
00:06:58,010 --> 00:07:00,250
So, so bottom line,

153
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:02,860
you're not gonna pay me back.
Is that correct?

154
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,490
Well, truth be told,

155
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:07,820
I was gonna pay you back,
but your attitude irks me.

156
00:07:07,890 --> 00:07:09,120
I irk you?

157
00:07:09,190 --> 00:07:11,660
That's right.
I find you irksome.

158
00:07:13,030 --> 00:07:16,070
You're a big, fat irk.

159
00:07:16,130 --> 00:07:19,860
Hey, hey, you borrow $38,
you owe me $38.

160
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:21,540
Yeah, well, you've been living

161
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,700
in my Malibu beach house
for six years.

162
00:07:23,770 --> 00:07:25,870
You owe me $1 million.

163
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:27,640
A million dollars?

164
00:07:27,710 --> 00:07:31,680
That's a one followed
by six tight little sphincters.

165
00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:41,630
(panting)

166
00:07:44,290 --> 00:07:46,460
Wow. You look tired.

167
00:07:46,530 --> 00:07:49,200
Yesterday, I had
a quarter tank of gas.

168
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:51,970
Today, I drive a mile
into Topanga Canyon

169
00:07:52,030 --> 00:07:52,730
and bang, empty.

170
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:53,970
Huh.

171
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,540
There's no cell coverage
up there,

172
00:07:55,610 --> 00:07:58,080
so I had to hump all the way
back down to the beach

173
00:07:58,140 --> 00:07:59,100
to call Triple-A.

174
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:00,250
Oh, that's a shame.

175
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:01,610
Shame, my ass. How the hell

176
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,750
did a quarter tank of gas
disappear overnight?

177
00:08:03,810 --> 00:08:05,840
It's a mystery.

178
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:08,560
(sniffs)

179
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:10,890
Wait a minute...

180
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:13,820
I smell gasoline.

181
00:08:13,890 --> 00:08:14,720
Really?

182
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:15,850
(sniffs)

183
00:08:15,930 --> 00:08:17,030
I... I don't smell anything.

184
00:08:17,090 --> 00:08:19,420
(sniffs)

185
00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:30,810
You have gas on your breath.

186
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:31,940
You siphoned my tank.

187
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:33,750
Oh, please.

188
00:08:33,810 --> 00:08:37,010
You think I stuck a rubber hose
down your gas tank,

189
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:40,190
sucked on it until the gas ran
out of your tank and into mine

190
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:42,580
thereby compensating me
for the $38 you owe me?

191
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:47,060
That's preposterous.

192
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,820
Yeah...

193
00:08:48,890 --> 00:08:50,360
Yeah, you're right.

194
00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:52,900
What was I thinking?

195
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:02,770
What are you doing?

196
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:05,580
Do me a favor. Say...

197
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:08,640
"preposterous" again.

198
00:09:08,710 --> 00:09:11,340
You're crazy!

199
00:09:11,410 --> 00:09:13,880
Get that away from me!

200
00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:15,110
Oh, come on.

201
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:16,810
Come on.

202
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:20,400
Just for grins say,
"Help me. My head's on fire."

203
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:21,560
All right, all right, all right,

204
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:23,050
I sucked the gas
out of your car!

205
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:24,300
Now turn it off!

206
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,940
Okay, fine. Well played.

207
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,140
You got your money back.

208
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,830
Um... actually...

209
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:36,730
at 473.9 cents a gallon,

210
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:41,280
you had only $13.22
worth in your tank,

211
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:43,480
so you still owe me $24.78.

212
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,290
Get out.

213
00:09:51,350 --> 00:09:52,450
What?

214
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:54,250
Get out of my house.

215
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,320
You know what? I just might.

216
00:09:56,390 --> 00:09:58,860
No, no, no, "might" implies
you have a choice.

217
00:09:58,930 --> 00:10:02,170
Oh, so you're going
to throw me out over $24.78?

218
00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:03,760
No, I'm throwing you out

219
00:10:03,830 --> 00:10:05,960
because you're a cheap,
gas-sucking, flammable irk!

220
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:08,810
I am not cheap.

221
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:11,550
Leaving.

222
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:19,320
Ow, ow, ow!

223
00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:25,020
These things just happen.

224
00:10:25,090 --> 00:10:27,030
I don't know. They seem
to happen to you a lot.

225
00:10:27,090 --> 00:10:28,460
(knocking)

226
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:30,260
Oh, hey, guys.

227
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:31,530
What are you doing here?

228
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:33,690
Dad pissed off
Uncle Charlie again.

229
00:10:35,530 --> 00:10:38,200
Sorry to show up unannounced
like this.

230
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:39,470
No problem.

231
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:40,840
It's always good to see you.

232
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:42,470
JUDITH:
He got kicked
out again?

233
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:45,140
Damn it, Alan.
What'd you do now?

234
00:10:45,210 --> 00:10:46,850
I didn't do anything.

235
00:10:46,910 --> 00:10:49,620
But I'm not going to be staying
at Charlie's anymore,

236
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,620
so I thought I should bring
Jake's stuff back here

237
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,450
until I find a place of my own.

238
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:54,590
Fine. Good luck.

239
00:10:54,650 --> 00:10:56,380
But it's nobody's fault.

240
00:10:56,450 --> 00:10:58,950
I just think it's time
for me to move on.

241
00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:00,590
Okay. Good night.

242
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,760
But FYI: Charlie's
a thief, a liar

243
00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:04,600
and I suspect something
of a firebug.

244
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:07,790
Really? Hmm, he struck me
as a straight shooter.

245
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:09,760
Little loosey-goosey
with the liquor and the ladies,

246
00:11:09,830 --> 00:11:12,760
but all in all,
a good fella.

247
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:16,540
In what universe
is Charlie Harper a good fella?

248
00:11:16,610 --> 00:11:20,010
Well, I certainly don't know him
as well as you do,

249
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:23,420
so I'll just shut my piehole.

250
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:26,680
Uh, anyway, here's
the rest of Jake's stuff.

251
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:29,260
I'll get you my new address

252
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:30,320
as soon as I have one.

253
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:31,630
You do that.

254
00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:33,700
So, where are you gonna stay
till then?

255
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,200
Piehole, Herb.

256
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:36,460
Oh, I don't know.

257
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:38,600
Things are a little tight
right now,

258
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:40,590
so a hotel isn't
really an option.

259
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:43,930
Maybe the Y
for a couple of days, you know,

260
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,130
but we'll see.

261
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:50,270
I could sleep in my office
or... in the car.

262
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:52,080
Oh, well,
you can't do that.

263
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:53,410
Piehole, piehole, piehole!

264
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:54,520
Come on, Judith,
you can't expect

265
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:56,150
a man to sleep
in his car.

266
00:11:56,210 --> 00:11:59,480
You're good people.
Just let me just get
a few things.

267
00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:01,060
I'm sure it'll be fine.

268
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,560
He's not the kind of guy
who'll overstay his welcome.

269
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:06,580
He's been at his brother's
for six years.

270
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:07,830
Uh, Herb,
would you mind

271
00:12:07,890 --> 00:12:10,960
giving me a hand
with the NordicTrack?

272
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:11,970
Oh, sure.

273
00:12:14,430 --> 00:12:16,790
Love you.

274
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:21,830
(doorbell rings)

275
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:23,370
Hey, Charlie.

276
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,670
Oh, hey, Herb, what's up?

277
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:26,370
I came to pick up some stuff
for Alan.

278
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:27,740
For Alan?

279
00:12:27,810 --> 00:12:29,340
Yeah, he's staying
with Judith and I

280
00:12:29,410 --> 00:12:30,680
till he gets back on his feet.

281
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:33,320
Gee, Herb, I hate to be
the bearer of bad news,

282
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:36,280
but I've been waiting six years
for that khaki-wearing weasel

283
00:12:36,350 --> 00:12:37,680
to get on his feet.

284
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:39,220
Judith mentioned that...

285
00:12:39,290 --> 00:12:41,000
using a lot of the same words,
interestingly enough.

286
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:43,600
Anyway, he wanted to avoid
having a scene with you,

287
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:46,020
so he asked if I'd pick up
some of his stuff.

288
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:47,000
And you agreed?

289
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:49,590
I had to get out of there,
Charlie.

290
00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:51,170
Okay, okay, fine.

291
00:12:51,230 --> 00:12:52,200
What do you need?

292
00:12:52,270 --> 00:12:53,270
Quite a few things,
actually.

293
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:54,880
He gave me a list.

294
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:57,040
Well, let him stay
in there long enough,

295
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:59,080
he'll give you
a bleeding ulcer.

296
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:00,770
Yeah, Judith said that, too.

297
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:05,580
Anyway, uh, melatonin,
a mouth guard.

298
00:13:05,650 --> 00:13:06,990
I guess he grinds
his teeth at night.

299
00:13:07,050 --> 00:13:09,590
I myself have
restless legs syndrome.

300
00:13:09,650 --> 00:13:10,780
But just the left leg.

301
00:13:10,850 --> 00:13:12,420
Right leg sleeps
like a baby.

302
00:13:12,490 --> 00:13:13,900
What else, Herb?

303
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:16,830
Well, I also got apnea
and I tend to drool a lot.

304
00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:20,370
The list, Herb.

305
00:13:20,430 --> 00:13:21,970
Oh, yeah, yeah.

306
00:13:22,030 --> 00:13:24,730
Let's see, shower cap,
loofa mitt

307
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,400
and some kind of little stool

308
00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:28,980
that elevates his feet while
he's sitting on the toilet.

309
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:29,680
What?

310
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:31,050
Yeah, apparently when

311
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:32,710
the morning coffee
doesn't do the job,

312
00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:34,780
having his feet up
gives him that extra leverage

313
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:36,610
for a successful bowel movement.

314
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:38,850
You're kidding?

315
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:40,290
No. Look.

316
00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:42,690
"For a successful BM."

317
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:44,680
That would mean
"bowel movement."

318
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:48,890
Okay, fine.
Guest bedroom's
right down there.

319
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:49,930
Oh.

320
00:13:49,990 --> 00:13:50,960
Hey, I just made

321
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:52,700
a pitcher of margaritas.
You want one?

322
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:54,590
Oh, gee, I'll have to pass.

323
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:56,290
Judith's waiting for me
to get back,

324
00:13:56,370 --> 00:13:57,610
and she gets really steamed...

325
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:58,740
Salt or no salt?

326
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:01,330
Salt. Okay.
You got it.

327
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:04,040
(TV show playing)

328
00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:10,240
This is so weird.

329
00:14:10,310 --> 00:14:11,880
It's just
for a couple days, Jake.

330
00:14:11,950 --> 00:14:13,450
Don't make
a federal case.

331
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:16,660
You know this is probably
gonna affect my schoolwork.

332
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:19,760
How? It's not like your grades
could get any lower.

333
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:22,050
That's good, Alan.
Undermine his self-esteem.

334
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:24,720
You see what I have to live with
on weekends?

335
00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:28,090
Nobody's talking
to you.

336
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:31,230
Where's he gonna sleep?

337
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:33,130
I'm not a "he."
I'm your father.

338
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:37,070
How'd you get to be my father
if you're not a "he"?

339
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:39,740
Go make up
the couch.

340
00:14:39,810 --> 00:14:42,020
What about
the guest room?

341
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:43,520
That's not a guest room
anymore.

342
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:44,540
It's Herb's train room.

343
00:14:44,610 --> 00:14:45,810
His what?

344
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:48,150
He's a model train
aficionado.

345
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:50,830
Aficionado?

346
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:52,860
He works hard.
He deserves a hobby.

347
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:56,250
Sometimes he lets me
wear the hat.

348
00:14:56,330 --> 00:14:57,900
I begged you for years

349
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:59,920
to let me turn that
into a game room.

350
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,500
Bumper pool, ping-pong,
something.

351
00:15:02,570 --> 00:15:03,810
Oh, this is different.
How?

352
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:05,970
Herb can play
with his trains alone.

353
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:09,910
I'm sure he does plenty of stuff
in there alone.

354
00:15:09,970 --> 00:15:11,540
Excuse me?

355
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:13,410
Nothing.

356
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:15,150
(quietly):
I got it.

357
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:25,290
This is so beautiful.

358
00:15:25,350 --> 00:15:26,620
Yep.

359
00:15:26,690 --> 00:15:29,060
Can I confess
something, Charlie?

360
00:15:29,130 --> 00:15:30,360
What's that?

361
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:33,800
I sometimes wonder
about the road not taken.

362
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:35,290
Which road is that?

363
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:37,460
Your road, Charlie.

364
00:15:37,530 --> 00:15:41,070
Oh. It's a good road, Herb.

365
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:44,110
So it's not a matter of the
grass always seems greener?

366
00:15:44,170 --> 00:15:47,940
No, no. No, the grass is pretty
frickin' green over here.

367
00:15:49,050 --> 00:15:51,250
Damn!

368
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:54,610
(ringtones playing)

369
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:56,080
Oops. It's me.

370
00:15:56,150 --> 00:15:58,150
I hope so.

371
00:15:58,220 --> 00:16:01,320
It's the road taken.

372
00:16:01,390 --> 00:16:02,690
You're not gonna answer it?

373
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:05,770
Nah. Judith will just harsh
my mellow.

374
00:16:05,830 --> 00:16:08,300
Yeah, she's a mellow-harsher.

375
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:09,530
But I love her.

376
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,070
That's nice.

377
00:16:11,130 --> 00:16:15,530
You know, in the boudoir,
we're very simpatico.

378
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,400
Glad to hear it.

379
00:16:17,470 --> 00:16:18,900
On top of everything else,

380
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:23,120
she actually let me put
my train set in her back room.

381
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:27,780
Whoo-whoo.

382
00:16:38,490 --> 00:16:40,160
(moans)

383
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:48,730
Damn cran-apple juice.

384
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:54,170
I should start wearing a diaper.

385
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:08,750
(urinating)

386
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:14,160
(breaks wind)

387
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:18,910
(urinating continues)

388
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:26,650
(intermittent urinating)

389
00:17:26,710 --> 00:17:28,150
(toilet flushes)

390
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:47,200
It's about time
you got home.

391
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:49,790
Mm...

392
00:17:49,870 --> 00:17:53,370
Is that an apology
I'm feeling?

393
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,370
Mm...

394
00:18:04,610 --> 00:18:05,780
Oopsy.

395
00:18:05,850 --> 00:18:08,220
(pounding)

396
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:10,930
Where's my husband?

397
00:18:10,990 --> 00:18:12,360
Sleeping on the deck.

398
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:14,120
What? Why?

399
00:18:14,190 --> 00:18:15,050
He's drunk.

400
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,920
Herb's not a drinker.

401
00:18:16,990 --> 00:18:19,020
No argument there.

402
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:20,870
All right, here's how
it's gonna go:

403
00:18:20,930 --> 00:18:22,230
I am taking him home with me

404
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:24,370
and you're taking back
your brother.

405
00:18:24,430 --> 00:18:27,160
How 'bout this?

406
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:31,980
You and Alan patch things up
and I keep Stretch out there.

407
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:33,970
I'm kinda fond of the big lug.

408
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:36,440
Charlie, I'm in no mood.

409
00:18:36,510 --> 00:18:38,110
Not what I heard.

410
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:38,640
What?

411
00:18:38,710 --> 00:18:41,280
Whoo-whoo!

412
00:18:41,350 --> 00:18:44,350
I don't have time for this.
Alan, get in here!

413
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:45,150
No!

414
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:47,320
Do not make me
come get you!

415
00:18:50,290 --> 00:18:51,160
Now...

416
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:53,470
apologize
to your brother.

417
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:56,960
Do it!

418
00:18:59,770 --> 00:19:02,610
I'm sorry I made such
a big deal out of everything.

419
00:19:02,670 --> 00:19:03,800
And?

420
00:19:03,870 --> 00:19:08,570
(sighs)
And you can keep the $24.78.

421
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:10,210
This was all about $24?

422
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:12,390
Plus he tried
to set me on fire!

423
00:19:12,450 --> 00:19:14,820
After you sucked my gas!

424
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:18,380
Hey, baby, when did you
arrive on the scene?

425
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:20,220
Just get in the car.

426
00:19:20,290 --> 00:19:22,460
(whispering):
Look, poop stool.

427
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:25,560
Um... I'm gonna need that.

428
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,600
You can pop a blood vessel
if you push too hard.

429
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:33,340
Words to live by.

430
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:35,130
Herb, car!

431
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,600
Bye, Charlie.
Bye, Herb.

432
00:19:36,670 --> 00:19:38,070
Bye, all.
Bye, Herb.

433
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:40,170
This was fun.
Let's do it again.

434
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:42,170
Now!

435
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:48,110
Kinda like old times, huh?

436
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:51,420
Judith kicking me out
and you taking me in.

437
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:56,750
You are taking me in,
aren't you?

438
00:19:56,830 --> 00:19:58,770
Give me one good reason
why I should.

439
00:19:58,830 --> 00:20:02,070
Uh, well...

440
00:20:02,130 --> 00:20:03,530
we're... we're family...

441
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,370
um... brothers.

442
00:20:05,430 --> 00:20:09,200
We share blood
and, and, and history.

443
00:20:09,270 --> 00:20:12,540
We have a bond
that unites us forever.

444
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:15,570
Nah. What else you got?

445
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:17,990
Okay. Uh...

446
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:19,550
what about my French toast?

447
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:20,490
You like that.

448
00:20:20,550 --> 00:20:21,790
You know,

449
00:20:21,850 --> 00:20:26,850
thick and fluffy with cinnamon
and powdered sugar.

450
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:28,650
Mm...!

451
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:31,260
All right, you can stay.

452
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:32,230
Really?

453
00:20:32,290 --> 00:20:33,320
No.

454
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:38,210
(flustered chuckle):
Ha-ha!

455
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:40,140
Very funny.

456
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,480
Charlie?

457
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:43,950
(keys jingle)

458
00:20:44,010 --> 00:20:48,050
(thudding at door)

459
00:20:48,110 --> 00:20:51,010
You changed the locks?

460
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:53,780
I was only gone for six hours!

461
00:20:53,850 --> 00:20:55,990
Charlie?

462
00:20:56,050 --> 00:20:58,550
(thunder rumbles)

463
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:03,650
Oh, crap.

464
00:21:08,970 --> 00:21:11,510
Here you go.
Black, two sugars.

465
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:12,740
Double glazed.

466
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:14,430
Thank you.

467
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:16,730
No, thank you.

468
00:21:16,810 --> 00:21:18,750
I can't believe
Grandma fired me.

469
00:21:18,810 --> 00:21:21,980
Well, the labor market's
very competitive these days.

470
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:23,310
There's always somebody
brighter and better

471
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:33,380
and willing to work for less.
