1
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:07,560
I really appreciate you
getting up so early

2
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:08,720
and driving me to work.

3
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:14,230
I owe you one.

4
00:00:14,290 --> 00:00:15,620
You owed me one

5
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:18,660
when I didn't smother
you in your crib.

6
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,940
Well, then,
I owe you two.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,640
My car will be out of the shop
in a couple of days.

8
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:27,570
There was a terrible knock
in the engine.

9
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:28,680
Like a... like a...

10
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:29,780
(imitating knocking)

11
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:32,580
I kept saying, "Come in,"
but nobody did.

12
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:34,210
(chuckling)

13
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:35,720
Ooh, carpool lane—
that's us.

14
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:36,780
We could...
Shut up.

15
00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:38,220
Right.

16
00:00:39,950 --> 00:00:41,290
It's 7:00.

17
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:43,580
Where are all these
damn people going?

18
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:44,920
I know, right?

19
00:00:44,990 --> 00:00:46,790
I deal with that every day.

20
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:48,300
Very frustrating.

21
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:50,330
Sometimes I dream about buying
a cabin in the woods

22
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:51,420
and just getting away...

23
00:00:51,490 --> 00:00:53,790
I said shut up.
Yes, you did.

24
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:58,340
The people going that way
should just switch jobs

25
00:00:58,400 --> 00:00:59,960
with the people
going this way,

26
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:01,910
and everybody can leave their
freaking cars in the garage.

27
00:01:01,970 --> 00:01:03,540
(chuckles)

28
00:01:03,610 --> 00:01:06,080
You know, that's a...
that's a hell of an idea.

29
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:07,310
Right on.

30
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:08,850
Don't patronize me.

31
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:10,140
Sorry.

32
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:14,610
Wait a minute.

33
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:17,280
How are you getting back
to Malibu?

34
00:01:18,190 --> 00:01:19,260
Uh, I...
I was, uh...

35
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:20,220
I was hoping...
No.

36
00:01:20,290 --> 00:01:21,450
Charlie.
Take the bus.

37
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:23,520
There's no bus
from Tarzana to Malibu.

38
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:25,520
Then, take a series
of buses.

39
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:28,640
And don't get stuck on having
to end up in Malibu.

40
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:30,870
Charlie, come on. It...

41
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:31,860
it's just for
a couple of days.

42
00:01:31,930 --> 00:01:33,270
That's what Mom said

43
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:35,610
when she brought you home
from the hospital.

44
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:36,670
(chuckling)

45
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:38,480
Good one.

46
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:40,910
(imitating Stan Laurel):
You're a very funny man, Ollie.

47
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:43,190
You certainly are.

48
00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:47,690
It's Laurel and Hardy.

49
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:48,680
Boy, they used to...

50
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:50,980
they used to get
in some wacky jams, huh?

51
00:01:51,050 --> 00:01:52,220
(laughing)

52
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:54,730
What about, uh...
uh, Abbott and Costello?

53
00:01:54,790 --> 00:01:58,020
(imitating Costello):
"Hey, Abbott!"

54
00:01:58,090 --> 00:02:00,390
Or, uh... or, uh,
Martin and Lewis?

55
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:05,200
(imitating Jerry Lewis):
"Hey, lady, with the flavin'
and the mavin' and the wow."

56
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:09,610
Three Stooges?

57
00:02:09,670 --> 00:02:11,070
(imitating Curly)
"Nyuck, nyuck, nyuck, nyuck."

58
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:14,440
(laughing)

59
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:16,070
ALAN:
Whoa, what...
why are we stopping?

60
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:17,390
(punches landing)
Ow! Ow! Ow!

61
00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:19,650
"Oh, a wise guy"... ow!

62
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:23,650
Okay, I don't mind

63
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:25,620
the good-natured
brotherly punching,

64
00:02:25,690 --> 00:02:28,560
but you did not have
to twist my nipples.

65
00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:30,130
You're lucky I
didn't rip them off

66
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:31,060
and feed them to you.

67
00:02:31,130 --> 00:02:32,670
Um, you know, if you...

68
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:34,800
if you really have to go
to the bathroom, there's, uh...

69
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:36,360
there's one right
down the hallway.

70
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:37,860
What's wrong with the one
in your office?

71
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:39,160
Uh, it's not really for guests.

72
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,740
Neither is my house.

73
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,870
Um, you know, I think
we're out of paper towels.

74
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:45,400
I'll wipe my hands on you.

75
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:47,320
Get out of the way.

76
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:51,310
Morning, Dr. Harper.

77
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:53,280
Morning, Melissa.

78
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:56,380
Hello, Melissa.

79
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:00,860

84
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:32,150
Good to know.

85
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:34,920
Hi, I'm Charlie,
Alan's brother.

86
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:35,950
Nice to meet you.

87
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:37,060
Nice to meet you, too.

88
00:03:37,130 --> 00:03:39,570
Thought you had to tinkle.
Go away.

89
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:43,840
So, how long you been working
for my baby brother?

90
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:45,930
About six months.

91
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,700
Wow, he's been
keeping you a secret

92
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:49,430
for six months?

93
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:52,900
Charlie, can I talk to you
for a minute?

94
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:54,550
There's no reason
to thank me

95
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:56,210
for the ride again, Alan.

96
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:58,920
Mi Mercedes, su Mercedes.

97
00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:01,950
It's what brothers do

98
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:05,290
when one is vastly more
fortunate than the other.

99
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:08,660
Seriously, we need to talk.

100
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:11,760
Excuse us.

101
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:16,900
Charlie, she is the best
receptionist I have ever had.

102
00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:18,970
I'm hoping to say the same.

103
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:21,540
Come on, Charlie, please
do not crap where I work.

104
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,400
Hey, you crap where I live.

105
00:04:24,470 --> 00:04:26,000
So tell me about her.

106
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,350
There's nothing to tell.

107
00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:28,710
She's a...
she's a terrific employee.

108
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:30,150
She does my scheduling,
my books.

109
00:04:30,210 --> 00:04:31,580
My patients love her.

110
00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:33,560
She keeps the whole operation
running like clockwork,

111
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:37,330
and she does it all
for crappy pay and no benefits.

112
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:40,350
So you're not hitting that?

113
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:41,950
No, I'm not hitting that.

114
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:43,590
And even if I
were hitting that,

115
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:45,390
I wouldn't use the phrase,
"hitting that."

116
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:47,760
It's a violent image
for a beautiful act.

117
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:49,630
Yeah, yeah...
so the coast is clear?

118
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:51,070
No, the coast is not clear.

119
00:04:51,130 --> 00:04:52,300
The coast is foggy

120
00:04:52,370 --> 00:04:54,740
and strewn with
dangerously pointy rocks.

121
00:04:55,810 --> 00:04:57,850
Can I get either of you
a cup of coffee?

122
00:04:57,910 --> 00:04:59,080
Sure.
No.

123
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:01,750
No for both of us.

124
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:02,940
Please leave.

125
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:04,180
All right.

126
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:05,390
Bye, Melissa.

127
00:05:05,450 --> 00:05:06,450
Bye, Charlie.

128
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:07,590
Hope I see you again.

129
00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:08,810
Oh, you'll see me tonight

130
00:05:08,890 --> 00:05:10,830
when I come back
to pick up your boss.

131
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:13,320
Oh, oh, no, Charlie, Charlie,

132
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:15,020
you don't have to make
that long drive.

133
00:05:15,090 --> 00:05:16,050
I'll take the bus.

134
00:05:16,130 --> 00:05:17,260
I thought there were no buses.

135
00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:19,870
If I have to, I'll charter one.

136
00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:22,640
Why don't I just give you
a ride home?

137
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:25,760
Oh, that
is so sweet of you.

138
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:28,680
You got a real gem here, Alan.

139
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:30,780
Tell you what,
when you get him home,

140
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:34,640
there will be a cold margarita
waiting for you out on my deck.

141
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:37,350
Which overlooks the ocean.

142
00:05:37,410 --> 00:05:38,940
On the beach.

143
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:41,520
In Malibu.

144
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:43,210
That sounds wonderful.

145
00:05:43,290 --> 00:05:44,690
It's really not:
it's chilly, damp,

146
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:46,620
and covered with pelican poop.

147
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:51,000
That's why he'll never win
the Malibu slogan contest.

148
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:52,660
(laughing)

149
00:05:52,730 --> 00:05:54,470
See you tonight, Melissa.

150
00:05:54,530 --> 00:05:55,490
Bye, Charlie.

151
00:05:55,570 --> 00:05:56,640
Have a great day, bro.

152
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:58,870
I hate you.
I hate you, too.

153
00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:03,100
Gee, your brother
is really cute.

154
00:06:03,170 --> 00:06:04,700
As a bug.

155
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:07,380
Bathroom?

156
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,910
Oh, let me give you the key.

157
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:14,610
Thank you.

158
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:17,850
You're very welcome.

159
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:20,520
You are a doll.

160
00:06:20,590 --> 00:06:22,890
You are cute.

161
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:30,530
She's actually a doll.

162
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:35,940
I wonder if she's
anatomically correct.

163
00:06:38,210 --> 00:06:40,050
♪ Men.

164
00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:42,920
(Melissa giggling loudly)

165
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:44,050
Yeah.

166
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,860
Who's the Smurf?

167
00:06:51,850 --> 00:06:54,220
The Smurf is my receptionist.

168
00:06:54,290 --> 00:06:57,420
You're letting Charlie hit that?

169
00:06:57,490 --> 00:07:00,020
Okay, look, first of all,
that is a very ugly phrase.

170
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:01,870
And second of all,
I'm not letting him.

171
00:07:01,930 --> 00:07:03,830
I mean, short of drugging him

172
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:06,130
and dumping him in the woods,
what can I do?
Yeah.

173
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:10,030
He is like an Alabama bloodhound
once he gets a whiff.

174
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:12,250
(Melissa giggling)

175
00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:13,820
Now it's just a matter

176
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:15,880
of waiting until it blows up
in my face.

177
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:17,750
And after it blows up
in my face,

178
00:07:17,810 --> 00:07:21,050
it will then circle around
and bite me in the ass.

179
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,460
That's me.

180
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:25,090
No face, no ass.

181
00:07:25,150 --> 00:07:26,350
Well, that's what you get

182
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:27,820
when you mix work
and personal.

183
00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:29,750
Which is why me and Charlie

184
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:32,130
have always kept everything
strictly professional.

185
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:37,570
Yeah, yeah, I've often wondered
about that.

186
00:07:37,630 --> 00:07:39,130
When I first started
to work here,

187
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:42,200
I laid down the law:
looky, no touchy.

188
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:50,810
Yipes.

189
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:52,640
All right, I'll
make you another,

190
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:55,020
but you got to promise
not to chug this one.

191
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:56,710
Promise!

192
00:07:58,450 --> 00:08:00,550
What a fun gal.

193
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:02,820
Charlie, do you know
how hard it is

194
00:08:02,890 --> 00:08:04,160
to find a decent
receptionist?

195
00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:06,700
Well, kudos, bro,
you did a great job.

196
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:10,360
Thank you, and I-I really
don't want to lose her.

197
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:11,830
Why would you lose her?

198
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:12,830
Oh, gee, I don't know.

199
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:14,230
Maybe because my brother intends

200
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:17,030
to defile and discard her
like a warm melon.

201
00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:19,180
A warm melon?

202
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:21,980
Nothing.

203
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:23,270
Anyway, my point is

204
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:25,620
that you're gonna leave her
with bad memories

205
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,240
that can only be erased
by removing herself

206
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:30,290
from anything that reminds her
of you— like me.

207
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:33,150
Is that what you're
worried about, Bunky?

208
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:34,720
Yes, that's
what I'm worried about.

209
00:08:34,790 --> 00:08:36,150
What did you think
I was worried about?

210
00:08:36,230 --> 00:08:37,970
What else
would I be worried about?

211
00:08:38,030 --> 00:08:39,100
Well, let's see.

212
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:41,590

your semi-literate son,

213

214
00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:45,810
But that's just off
the top of my head.

215
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:48,510
Charlie, please,
I am begging you.

216
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:49,830
Look, I understand
your concerns,

217
00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:50,880
but it's not like that.

218
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:52,140

219
00:08:52,210 --> 00:08:54,180

they're terrific.

220
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,170
They're terrific before.

to some happiness?

of happiness.

Wow, I'm impressed.
