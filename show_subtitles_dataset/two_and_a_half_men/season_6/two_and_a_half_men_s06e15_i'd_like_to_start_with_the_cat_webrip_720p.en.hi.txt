00:00:05,230 --> 00:00:06,600
Oh, man.

3
00:00:07,370 --> 00:00:08,940
That was intense.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,800
I need some fluids.

5
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:21,280
I must have been down a quart.

6
00:00:21,350 --> 00:00:24,150
Guess that makes you
up a quart, huh?

7
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:25,910
Hey.

8
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:28,180
You know what would be good
right now?

9
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:29,950
A pudding cup.

10
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:31,420
I got some in the fridge.

11
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:32,430
You want one?

12
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:34,590

13
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:36,370
Um...

14
00:00:36,430 --> 00:00:38,670
You have a bad experience
with pudding?

15
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:41,300
What are we doing, charlie?

16
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:44,270
Well, you're crying,
and my best guess

17
00:00:44,330 --> 00:00:46,530
Is i'm about to apologize
for something.

18
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:49,330
Every time i come over,
it's the same routine.

19
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:52,520
We have chinese takeout.
Then we have sex.

20
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:55,450
Then we roll over
and go to sleep.

21
00:00:55,510 --> 00:00:59,110
Which is why
i suggested the pudding.

22
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:02,450
You know, mix it up
a little.

23
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:05,980
Besides, what about all
the wonderful talking

24
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:08,800
And joking and, you know,
sharing we do?

25
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:10,500
Sharing?

26
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,630
What do we share, charlie?

27
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:16,410
Well, uh, we share
chinese takeout.

28
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:18,870
And, uh... Hey,
the other night,

29
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:20,680
We watched the laker game
together.

30
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:24,280
You watched it over my shoulder
while we were having sex.

31
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:27,670
Oh, come on. It was overtime.

32
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:30,720
What kind of relationship
is this?

33
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:33,450
We don't go anywhere.
We don't do anything.

34

35

What do you want to do?

36
00:01:36,290 --> 00:01:37,530
I can get laker tickets.

37
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:40,430
I don't want to go
to a basketball game!

38
00:01:40,490 --> 00:01:43,420
I want to know who you are.

39
00:01:43,490 --> 00:01:45,220
I want you to know who i am.

40
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:47,370

that you don't know.

She told me.

94
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:40,020
Why did she tell you?
I asked her.

95
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,950
Why did you ask?
How else do you get
to know a person?

96

on me after sex,

Would you go away?

99
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:51,560
That's beside
the point.

100
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:53,590
So, what happened?

101
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:55,600
I don't know.

102
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:56,830

No, she was crying.

108
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:10,950
She wants more
out of our relationship.

109
00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:13,680
More what?
I'm not sure.

110
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:15,970
I know it's not pudding.

111
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,980
Well, what did she say?

112
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:21,890
She said i don't know
her well enough.

113
00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:23,550
You tell me:
what's more important to know?

114
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:25,650
Her cat's name
or which of her body parts

115
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:27,050
You can't sneak up on?

116
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,720
Well, i'm not sure

117
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:30,790
One necessarily precludes
the other.

118
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:33,390
Yeah, well,
i've never been mule-Kicked

119
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:36,260

00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:19,420
Decided to dump me.

187
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:20,440
Huh.

188
00:07:21,530 --> 00:07:22,900
"huh," what?

189
00:07:22,970 --> 00:07:24,540
Oh, nothing, it's just...

190
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:27,530
Sometimes i feel
like i'm stealing your money.

191
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:30,400
So, tell me about this woman.

192
00:07:30,470 --> 00:07:31,740
Chelsea?

193
00:07:31,810 --> 00:07:33,350
Not much to tell.

194
00:07:33,410 --> 00:07:37,280
She's beautiful,
sexy, smart, independent.

195
00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:39,650
Sometimes when she laughs,

196
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,320
She makes a little
snorting noise.

197
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:42,820
It's really cute.

198
00:07:42,890 --> 00:07:43,960
Kind of like...

199
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:45,920
(giggling, snorting)

200
00:07:48,490 --> 00:07:50,620
Not as cute when i do it.

201
00:07:50,690 --> 00:07:52,360
Sounds like quite a catch.

202
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:53,640
She's okay.

203
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:54,970
Why did she dump you?

204
00:07:55,030 --> 00:07:57,530
Who can understand
a woman's mind?

205
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:01,830
Yeah, we're pretty
little puzzles, ain't we?

206
00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:04,050
So, it's not just me.

207
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:08,350
Anyway, for some reason,

208
00:08:08,410 --> 00:08:11,510
She suddenly became dissatisfied
with our relationship.

209
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:13,310
Well, describe the relationship.

210
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:14,410
It was great.

211
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:16,480
She'd come over
a couple times a week.

212
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:19,380
Either she'd bring food
or i'd have something delivered.

213
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:21,260
We'd have sex, then eat.

214
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:24,220
Then, maybe have sex again,
depending on what was on tv.

215
00:08:24,290 --> 00:08:27,760
And she became dissatisfied
with that?

216
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:29,960
I know, right?

217
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:33,380
Ooh.

218
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,480
Butterscotch.

219
00:08:34,540 --> 00:08:37,850
So, how did you feel
about losing her?

220
00:08:37,910 --> 00:08:39,780
What do you mean?
What do i mean?

221
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:41,270
Come on, charlie.

222
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:43,940
Dr. Seuss could diagnose this.

223
00:08:44,010 --> 00:08:46,080
You're stuffing yourself
with crap

224
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:48,190
To suppress
your negative feelings.

225
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:51,080
No, i'm pretty sure
that's why i drink.

226
00:08:51,150 --> 00:08:53,220
You have a choice here.

227
00:08:53,290 --> 00:08:55,850
You can dig down
and confront your feelings

228
00:08:55,930 --> 00:08:58,100
So they won't be controlling
your behavior,

229
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00,490
Or you can keep eating pudding
and cookies

230
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:03,560
Until you have more chins
than a chinese phone book.

231
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:06,010
Hmm.

232
00:09:06,070 --> 00:09:07,580
No, what else you got?

233
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:09,940
Do you have a better idea?

234
00:09:10,010 --> 00:09:12,080
What if i could
get chelsea back?

235
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:14,740
That would only be
a temporary solution.

236
00:09:14,810 --> 00:09:16,110
So?

237
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:17,520
That's what people said
about bourbon,

238
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:19,040
And we've been together
for almost 30 years.

239
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,690
Okay, you're right.

240
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:24,750
Go get chelsea back, and all
your problems will be solved.

241
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:26,750
I'm sensing sarcasm.

242
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:29,920
Oh, good, we're finally
making progress.

and sprinkles.

00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:51,820
No, thanks, i had a hot fudge
sundae for breakfast.

What do you want?

257
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,640
I just wanted to see you.

00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:10,670
I'm fine.

268

Nothing, nothing.

269
00:10:29,690 --> 00:10:30,890
I miss you.

270
00:10:30,950 --> 00:10:33,920
I miss you, too,
but it doesn't matter.

271
00:10:33,990 --> 00:10:35,920
Our relationship
wasn't going anywhere,

272
00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:37,790
And you are incapable
of change.

273
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:39,220
It's not that i'm incapable.

274
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:41,200
I've just been unwilling.

275
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:43,260
Thanks for clearing that up.

276
00:10:43,330 --> 00:10:45,100
No, no, no,

I've been seeing a shrink.

Really?

279
00:10:48,010 --> 00:10:49,940
Yeah, and i'm making
a lot of progress

280

call them?-- Personal issues.

come.

283
00:10:56,780 --> 00:10:58,090
Sit.

284
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:03,780
And check this out:
the shrink's a woman.

285
00:11:03,850 --> 00:11:04,880
A real ballbuster.

286
00:11:04,950 --> 00:11:06,420
I can't get away
with anything.

287
00:11:06,490 --> 00:11:07,800
Ballbuster?

288
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:09,400
In a good way.

289
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:12,530
You know, a buster
of emotional balls.

290
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:16,390
You should meet her.

291
00:11:16,470 --> 00:11:19,540
Are you suggesting we go
to couples counseling?

292
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:23,010
Um...

293
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:27,720
Sure.

294
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:30,650
I mean, i want to work
on our relationship,

295
00:11:30,710 --> 00:11:33,810
And what better way
than couples counseling?

296
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:35,410
You're serious.

297
00:11:35,490 --> 00:11:37,290
Well, of course
i'm serious.

00:11:37,350 --> 00:11:39,150
What, you think i'd blurt
out something like that

299
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:41,220
In the spur of the moment
in a desperate attempt

300
00:11:41,290 --> 00:11:42,790
To keep you from leaving?

301
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:44,630
It occurred to me.

302
00:11:44,690 --> 00:11:47,530
Well, clearly, you don't know
me as well as you should.

303
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:48,900
All right.

Absolutely.

Once a week, you sit on a couch

While she snips off
your testicles,

341
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:21,860
Reaches up
inside your chest cavity

342
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:24,860

00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:30,310

But it's worth it

347
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:36,970

a stranger to watch

348

down the toilet.

349
00:13:40,910 --> 00:13:44,480

00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:53,110
Hi, sweetie.

369
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:54,380
You're late.

370
00:14:54,450 --> 00:14:56,010
I know. I know.

371
00:14:56,090 --> 00:14:57,230
I'm sorry.

372
00:14:57,290 --> 00:14:58,860
But... (clears throat)

373
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:01,490
I have a good excuse.

374
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:04,100
Happy first day
of counseling.

375
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:06,190
You brought a present?

376
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:07,160
Yeah.

377
00:15:07,230 --> 00:15:08,490
Isn't that the protocol?

378
00:15:08,570 --> 00:15:09,440
No.

379
00:15:10,570 --> 00:15:11,940
So...

380
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,500
You don't want
this bottle of champagne?

381
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:18,550
Bastard got me again.

382
00:15:18,610 --> 00:15:20,720
Well, why don't we get started.

383
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:22,250
Hold on. Hold on.

384
00:15:22,310 --> 00:15:26,010
Does the name "mandu"
ring any kind of a bell?

385
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:27,380
What?

386
00:15:27,450 --> 00:15:30,380
I'm gonna kill him.

387
00:15:30,450 --> 00:15:33,520
Well, why don't we start out
with why we're here

388
00:15:33,590 --> 00:15:35,350
And what our goals are.

389
00:15:35,430 --> 00:15:37,670
Chelsea, would you like
to go first?

390
00:15:37,730 --> 00:15:39,200
Sure.

391
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:41,430
I want to know
if my relationship

392
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:43,640
With charlie
can be more than...

393
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:46,130
Sex, tv, and chinese food.

394
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:47,270
It can.

395
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:48,780
Right, doc?

396
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:49,910
Of course it can.

397
00:15:49,970 --> 00:15:51,170
Thank you.

398
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:52,770
Well, this is good.

399
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:54,070
This is progress.

400
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:57,210
I have to say this has
been a very good session.

401
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:58,740
Where do you think you're going?

402
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:00,660
Nowhere.

403
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:03,530
Just...

404
00:16:03,590 --> 00:16:05,530
Stretching my legs.

405
00:16:07,190 --> 00:16:10,260
Charlie, before you got here,
chelsea mentioned

406
00:16:10,330 --> 00:16:12,830
That she feels you've fallen
into a rut.

407
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:13,570
A rut?

408
00:16:13,630 --> 00:16:15,160
We're not in a rut.

409
00:16:15,230 --> 00:16:17,130
When's the last time
we did something new?

410
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,310
(sighs)

411
00:16:18,370 --> 00:16:20,580
Hello?

412
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:25,570
Great... And what else?

413
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:27,810
Uh...

414
00:16:29,110 --> 00:16:30,340
He's got nothing.

415
00:16:30,410 --> 00:16:32,680
Excuse me, but if
this is gonna work,

416
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:34,920
You can't jump all over me
while i'm thinking.

417
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:36,810
I'm sorry. Go ahead.

418
00:16:36,890 --> 00:16:38,390
Thank you.

419
00:16:41,290 --> 00:16:43,050
I got nothing.

420
00:16:44,590 --> 00:16:46,820
Okay, might i make a suggestion?

421
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:49,740
Would you be willing
to commit to chelsea

422
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:52,970
That maybe once a week,
twice a month,

423
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:54,480
You do something together

424
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:56,810
Completely outside
your comfort zone?

425
00:16:56,870 --> 00:16:58,470
Done. No problem.

426
00:16:58,540 --> 00:17:01,040
So, we could go
to the ballet,

427
00:17:01,110 --> 00:17:03,070
The opera,
visit my parents,

428
00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:04,050
Hang out
with my brother,

429
00:17:04,110 --> 00:17:05,610
Go hiking
with my friends?

430
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:07,110
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

431
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:09,210
I was thinking more like
renting a chick flick

432
00:17:09,290 --> 00:17:11,490
And ordering italian.

433
00:17:11,550 --> 00:17:12,820
This is hopeless.

434
00:17:12,890 --> 00:17:14,500
No, no, no, no,
there's hope.

435
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:15,860
There's always hope.

436
00:17:15,930 --> 00:17:16,960
Keep hope alive.

437
00:17:18,330 --> 00:17:20,030
I can do those things.

438
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:22,770
Come.

439
00:17:22,830 --> 00:17:24,030
Sit.

440
00:17:31,910 --> 00:17:34,420
Charlie, has it ever
occurred to you

441
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,380
That you might enjoy
doing new things

442
00:17:36,450 --> 00:17:37,750
And meeting new people?

443
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:43,920
I know i'm supposed
to say yes, but...

444
00:17:43,990 --> 00:17:48,660
Every fiber of my body
is screaming, "no!"

445
00:17:50,630 --> 00:17:52,900
All right, then i have to ask.

446
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:56,490
Given that you and chelsea
are such different people,

447
00:17:56,570 --> 00:17:59,470
Why do you want to be
in this relationship?

448
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:01,680
Well...

449
00:18:02,710 --> 00:18:04,480
'cause i'm crazy about her.

450
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:05,570
'cause, when i'm
with somebody else,

451
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:07,040
I'm thinking of her.

452
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:09,350
Not that i've been
with anybody else.

453
00:18:09,410 --> 00:18:10,370
Tell her, doc.

454
00:18:10,450 --> 00:18:11,950
He passed up strange.

455
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:14,920
See, that's got
to mean something,

456
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:17,780
Considering how i used to,
you know, live for strange.

457
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:20,050
First time
in the sack,

458
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:21,590
She was the strange.

459
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:24,570
Charlie, can i give you
my opinion as your therapist?

460
00:18:24,630 --> 00:18:26,900
Sure.
Shut up.

461
00:18:27,630 --> 00:18:30,900
Oh, god, i wish i could.

462
00:18:30,970 --> 00:18:32,740
Chelsea, look.

463
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:35,530
I know i'm not perfect.
(chuckles)

464
00:18:35,610 --> 00:18:37,040
Hey, hey, hey.

465
00:18:37,110 --> 00:18:38,310
I'm sorry.

466
00:18:38,370 --> 00:18:40,610
That was probably
unprofessional.

467
00:18:41,510 --> 00:18:42,570
Anyway,

468
00:18:42,650 --> 00:18:44,620
You need to know

469
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:46,710
That you mean
everything to me,

470
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:49,450
And i'll do whatever it
takes to make this work.

471
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:50,860
You really mean that?

472
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:51,950
I do.

473
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:53,950
Thank you, charlie.

474
00:18:55,790 --> 00:18:59,520
Well, this has been
very helpful.

475
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,540
Sit down, charlie.
Sit down, charlie.

476
00:19:02,430 --> 00:19:03,560
We're not done?

477
00:19:03,630 --> 00:19:05,830
Not even close.

478
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:07,600
Oh, boy.

479
00:19:07,670 --> 00:19:10,100
What else could we possibly
have to talk about?

480
00:19:10,170 --> 00:19:11,500
Well, there's always your mother

481
00:19:11,570 --> 00:19:13,070
And the fact
that your relationship issues

482
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:14,710
Are linked to your anger
towards her,

483
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:17,750
As well as fear
of your latent homosexuality.

484
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:22,460
It was kind of
a rhetorical question.

counseling?

Why would you do that?

497
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:06,670
You know, i've been asking
myself the same thing,

498
00:20:06,730 --> 00:20:08,870
And the only thing
i can come up with is:

Those were among the worst

503
00:20:17,270 --> 00:20:19,500
50 minutes of my entire life.

504
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:20,550
I told you.

505
00:20:20,610 --> 00:20:21,810
Didn't i tell you?

506
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:22,350
Yep.

507
00:20:22,410 --> 00:20:23,740
You told me.

00:20:23,810 --> 00:20:27,140
I bet you left with your gonads
in a guppy bag.

509
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:28,660
I didn't get a bag.

510
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,190
Going back next week?

511
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:31,420
Uh-Huh.

512
00:20:31,490 --> 00:20:32,690

Hey, just because counseling
didn't help your relationships

518
00:20:42,970 --> 00:20:44,410
Doesn't mean it won't help mine.

519
00:20:44,470 --> 00:20:46,410

00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:48,740

00:20:48,810 --> 00:20:50,810
Looking for something?

522
00:20:55,410 --> 00:20:58,010
Don't screw with me, kid.

523
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:01,450
Now, hand over the pudding
or you'll be sorry.
