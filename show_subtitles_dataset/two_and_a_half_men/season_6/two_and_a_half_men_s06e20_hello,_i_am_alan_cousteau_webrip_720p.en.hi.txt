1
00:00:03,770 --> 00:00:06,370
Aren't you going to wash
your hands before you eat?

2
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:07,710
No. I wrap the toilet paper

3
00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:09,480
around my fingers
like an oven mitt.

4
00:00:10,750 --> 00:00:12,690
You could catch
a puck with it.

5
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:15,860
So, Mom, what brings you
to our neck of the woods?

6
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:17,590
I'm showing a house
down at the beach.

7
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:19,230
Thought I'd swing by
and see my grandson.

8
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:20,560
Tada!

9
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:26,470
Nice house?

10
00:00:26,530 --> 00:00:27,560
Oh, magnificent.

11
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:29,260
And priced to move.

12
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:32,130
The owner lost everything in the
stock market, killed himself.

13
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:35,230
Oh, that's terrible.
Oh, no. He didn't do it
in the house. Thank God.

14
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:36,550
Even with an ocean view,

15
00:00:36,610 --> 00:00:40,850
suicide homes are
a bitch to unload.

16
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:43,120
Keep that in mind

17
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:44,710
in case you ever want to teach
your brother a lesson.

18
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:47,650
Thanks for the tip.

19
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:49,690
Good morning, Alan.

20
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:51,050
Morning, Jake.

21
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:52,890
Satan.

22
00:00:56,630 --> 00:00:57,930
Good morning, darling.

23
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,470
Two coffee cups?

24
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:01,140
Did you have a friend
spend the night?

25
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:02,710
Yes, I did.

26
00:01:02,770 --> 00:01:05,710
Couldn't get her to stand
on the trapdoor, huh?

27
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:09,170
Charlie, I don't have time
for coffee, so...

28
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:11,470
Oh, hello.

29
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:13,240
Hello.

30
00:01:13,310 --> 00:01:14,670
Uh, Chelsea,
this is my mother.

31
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:16,180
Mom, this is Chelsea.

32
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:17,420
Nice to meet you.

33
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:19,110
Nice to meet you, too.

34
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:20,750
Welcome back to the States.

35
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:24,550
Thank you.

36
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:26,080
Where have I been?

37
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:28,560
Charlie says you have
a place in Italy and...

38
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:30,530
You know, Chelsea,
sometimes when I'm drunk,

39
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:32,490
I make up stories, so...

40
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:35,330
You know, grain of salt.

41
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:38,670
That is quite
an engagement ring.

42
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:40,010
Thank you.

43
00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:42,500
Does your fiancé know
about this one?

44
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:44,870
My fiancé is this one.

45
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:52,750
You want me to put this
in a travel mug?

46
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:55,920
You didn't tell your mother
we're engaged?

47
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:57,630
If she hadn't sold me the house,

48
00:01:57,690 --> 00:01:59,700
she wouldn't even know
where I live.

49
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:07,990
When were you going
to tell her about me?

50
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:09,470
At the wedding?

51
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:13,470
Well, technically, I think we
have up to a year after that.

52
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:15,740
Shame on you.
I am so sorry.

53
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:18,480
It's all right, dear.
I'm used to it.

54
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:21,010
Although a phone call
would have been nice.

55
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:25,320
It's good to meet you.
Excuse me.

56
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:30,730
(door slamming)

57
00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:35,250
So, yea or nay
on the travel mug?

58
00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:37,770
Charlie, you just broke
your mother's heart.

59
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:42,340
(laughing)

60
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:50,150
How is that funny?

61
00:02:50,210 --> 00:02:52,080
It's not.
Guys, a little respect.

62
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:55,510
What is wrong with you?

63
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:58,920
Same stuff as always,
nothing new.

64
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:00,710
Does this smell
like butt to you?

65
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:06,260
♪ Men, men, men, men,
manly men, men, men ♪
♪ Ooh

66
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:07,920
♪ Men.

67
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:11,160
♪ Men.

68
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:13,340
I'm glad you came over.

69
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:15,240
That was the plan, wasn't it?

70
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:19,370
Yeah, but I thought you might
still be angry with me.

71
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,510
I'm not angry, Charlie.

72
00:03:20,570 --> 00:03:22,030
I'm just disappointed.

73
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:25,910
Gee, I'd kind of prefer it
if you were angry.

74
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:27,280
Why?

75
00:03:28,450 --> 00:03:30,820
Because angry sex is hot.

76
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:32,080
Disappointed sex is...

77
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:34,020
well, we might
as well be married.

78
00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:36,590
Just brush your teeth.

79
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:38,650
Brushing.

80
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,120
Look, I understand

81
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:42,520
you have a difficult
relationship with your mom.

82
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:44,020
Uh-huh.

83
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:45,890
But it makes things
kind of tough on me.

84
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:48,160
Hey, I don't expect you
to dislike her right away.

85
00:03:48,230 --> 00:03:52,600
Give it time.
Let it happen naturally.

86
00:03:52,670 --> 00:03:54,840
That's not funny.

87
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:57,050
If I'm going to marry
into your family,

88
00:03:57,110 --> 00:03:59,880
I want us to act like a family,
care for each other.

89
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:03,280
With my family,
it's kind of either/or.

90
00:04:03,350 --> 00:04:04,920
Let me put it this way.

91
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:07,550
I'm taking your mother
to lunch on Thursday.

92
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:11,290
(choking and coughing)

93
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:13,420
You're doing what?

94
00:04:13,490 --> 00:04:15,090
I'm not going to participate

95
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:17,000
in this childish
little feud of yours.

96
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:19,560
It's not a childish feud.

97
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:22,000
Boy.

98
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:24,040
Come on, Charlie.
What's wrong with me

99
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:26,400
having a warm and healthy
relationship with your mother?

100
00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:29,810
Well, for starters,
you'll be the only one.

101
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:32,970
Ever.

102
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,250
Oh, don't be so dramatic.

103
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:36,470
No, no, no, no.

104
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:37,920
I'm not being dramatic enough.

105
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:40,250
I should be wearing tights
and holding a skull.

106
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:43,730
Preferably hers.

107
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:45,060
It's just lunch.

108
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:48,050
That's what Hitler said
to Czechoslovakia.

109
00:04:48,130 --> 00:04:51,030
Hitler said, "It's just lunch"?

110
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:53,830
Well, he said it in German.

111
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:55,270
Watch the History Channel.

112
00:04:56,370 --> 00:04:59,640
Charlie, I'm not
doing this to hurt you.

113
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:02,230
Did you ever think that by my
spending time with your mother,

114
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:04,280
I can get a better
understanding of you?

115
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:06,170
Chelsea, trust me.

116
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:09,040
Any insight you gain
into me via my mother

117
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:10,480
will end our relationship

118
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:13,460
faster than catching me
in bed with a farm animal.

119
00:05:14,990 --> 00:05:17,290
Just relax.
It'll be fine.

120
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:20,490
That's what Hitler said
to Poland.

121
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:24,170
And for the record,

122
00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:27,040
as long as we've been going out,
I've never met your mother.

123
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:28,470
My mother's in Illinois.

124
00:05:28,530 --> 00:05:31,900
Oh, yeah, and my mother's
in "Italy."

125
00:05:31,970 --> 00:05:35,040
My mother really
lives in Illinois.

126
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:38,310
And besides, when you meet her,
you will count your blessings

127
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:40,050
you have someone
as wonderful as your mom.

128
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:42,840
Tell you what,
I'll trade you.

129
00:05:42,910 --> 00:05:45,010
Sight unseen,
my mom for yours.
Charlie.

130
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:48,250
I'll even throw in Alan and
a couple of Omaha steaks.

131
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,360
Come here.

132
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:52,620
No, I don't want to.

133
00:05:52,690 --> 00:05:55,700
I'm too upset.

134
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:58,370
Okay. Good night.

135
00:06:00,130 --> 00:06:04,300
I'm sorry. I can't separate
my emotions from my body.

136
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:05,210
I understand.

137
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:06,810
I don't want to punish you.

138
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:08,300
I'm just saying,
if my heart's not in it,

139
00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:11,040
then it's just my penis
going through the motions.

140
00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:13,520
Well, we certainly
wouldn't want that.

141
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:16,250
Good night.

142
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:18,240
Good night.

143
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:28,120
♪ Men.

144
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:34,730
Chelsea?

145
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,940
I'm not upset anymore.

146
00:06:39,570 --> 00:06:41,710
Charlie, I'm sleeping.

147
00:06:41,770 --> 00:06:43,500
I know.

148
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:46,400
Can you just wake up enough
so it's not weird?

149
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:52,440
Never mind.
Sweet dreams.

150
00:06:54,990 --> 00:06:56,790
♪ Men.

151
00:06:56,850 --> 00:07:02,290
Okay, let me remind you, this is
Malibu beachfront property.

152
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:05,400
The previous owner
had a spectacular view

153
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:09,390
as he filled his pockets with
rocks and jumped into the pool.

154
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,860
Mom?

155
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:13,210
Hang on.

156
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:17,000
No, it's not a suicide home.

157
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:19,470
At most it's...

158
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:21,210
suicide adjacent.

159
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:24,220
All right, get back to me.

160
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:26,960
What are you doing here?

161
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:30,160
What, I can't come visit
my mother at work?

162
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:32,280
Well, I suppose you could,

163
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:35,130
but I've been here for 22 years
and you never have.

164
00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:38,020
Well, maybe
if you validated parking.

165
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:42,030
Or any part of my life.

166
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:43,410
What do you want, Charlie?

167
00:07:43,470 --> 00:07:47,180
Okay, first of all,
I want to apologize

168
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:49,610
for not telling you about
Chelsea and the engagement.

169
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:52,040
I know that was wrong
and selfish of me.

170
00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:54,280
Thank you.

171
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:56,570
Good, I'm glad
we got that out of the way.

172
00:07:56,650 --> 00:08:00,260
So, I understand you guys
are having lunch tomorrow.

173
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:02,160
Yes, we are.
Is that a problem?

174
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:03,890
No, no, no, it's great.

175
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:05,980
I came all the way down here
and paid for my own parking

176
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:07,700
to tell you it's great.

177
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:09,800
Uh-huh.

178
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:14,200
All right, let's put our cards
on the table.

179
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:15,530
What's your angle?

180

181
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:18,860
I have no angle.

182
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:20,980
Yeah, and I have no hangover.

183
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:24,750
Look, Charlie, if you're really
going to marry this woman,

184
00:08:24,810 --> 00:08:27,420
I want to get started
on the right foot with her.

185
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:29,180
I don't want to make
the same mistake I made

186
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:30,650
with Alan's wife June.

187
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:31,840

188

Oh, whatever.

189
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:36,480
Heinous woman.

190
00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:39,220
The fact remains,
had I overlooked that

191
00:08:39,290 --> 00:08:41,530
and welcomed her
into the family,

192
00:08:41,590 --> 00:08:43,260
she wouldn't have kept me
at arm's length

193
00:08:43,330 --> 00:08:44,830
all during
Jake's formative years

194
00:08:44,890 --> 00:08:47,130
and I'd have a better
relationship with him today.

195
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,100
Do you want a better
relationship with him?

196
00:08:49,170 --> 00:08:52,340
Not the way he is now.

197
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:55,170
But if I'd gotten
to him earlier,

198
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:57,680
he wouldn't have the manners
of an outhouse rat.

199
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:03,480
So, bottom line: you want
a good relationship with Chelsea

200
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:05,690
so you can get your hooks
into the next generation?

201
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:09,720
Can't I just want to be
a loving mother and grandmother?

00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:52,850
Um, uh, actually...

359
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:55,460
Chels, we have plans
on Saturday, remember?

360
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:56,690
What plans?

361
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:58,280
Oh, for God's sake,

362
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:00,150
can't you just play along?

363
00:17:01,290 --> 00:17:03,020
We'll be there.

364
00:17:03,090 --> 00:17:04,620
Wonderful. Ta-ta.

365
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:08,430
Are you proud of yourself?

366
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:11,140
Not really.
I lost that one.

367
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:20,780
♪ "R" is for the rifle
in my mouth ♪

368
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:26,840
♪ Put them all together,
they spell "mother" ♪

369
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:32,990
♪ A word that's only half
of how I feel. ♪

370
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:36,750
♪ Men.

371
00:17:42,930 --> 00:17:47,530
(bad French accent):
Hello, I am Alan Cousteau.

372
00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:52,900
I left the Calypso at...

373
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:55,880
0500 hours,

374
00:17:55,950 --> 00:18:00,760
and have descended
to a depth of 60 fathoms.

375
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:07,800
And yet my Rolex
is keeping perfect time.

376
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:11,100
Oh, look,
there goes a giant squid.

377
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:12,320
Alan?

378
00:18:18,070 --> 00:18:19,670
Yes?

379
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:21,440
What are you doing?

380
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:25,400
Um...

381
00:18:25,470 --> 00:18:27,340
I got no good answer.

382
00:18:29,710 --> 00:18:32,410
It's Saturday night,
and I'm all alone.

383
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:34,250
Do you know
where Charlie is?

384
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:37,060
We're supposed to be
at your mother's at 7:00.

385
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:40,190
(French accent):
Oh, you are cutting it close.

386
00:18:41,690 --> 00:18:43,120
Have you seen him?

387
00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:45,890
Uh, not for a couple of hours.
Have you tried his cell?

388
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:49,030
I did. There's no answer.
I'm getting worried.

389
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:50,040
(door opens)

390
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:51,170
Chelsea, I'm home.

391
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:52,160
Thank goodness.

392
00:18:53,870 --> 00:18:56,070
(French accent):
I return to the deep.

393
00:18:57,740 --> 00:18:59,540
Where have you been?

394
00:18:59,610 --> 00:19:01,380
Picking up a little surprise
for you.

395
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,010
Come on in.

396
00:19:05,150 --> 00:19:06,090
Mom?

397
00:19:06,150 --> 00:19:08,920
Hello, sweetie. Oh!

398
00:19:08,990 --> 00:19:12,690
Ooh, feels like you gave up
on the Jenny Craig, huh?

399
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:15,900
What are you doing here?

400
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:17,360
I flew her in
from Illinois.

401
00:19:17,430 --> 00:19:20,740
First class.
Very swanky.

402
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:22,570
Of course, I had
some rich Jew lawyer

403
00:19:22,630 --> 00:19:24,200
chewing my ear off
the whole way.

404
00:19:24,270 --> 00:19:26,840
Tell her about the food.

405
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:29,130
Oh, the food was terrific,

406
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:32,350
but the flight attendant
was a colored homo.

407
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:37,920
I'm glad they make 'em pick up
the dinner rolls with tongs

408
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:40,010
'cause I can't risk the AIDS.

409
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:43,730
I hope you didn't fill up.

410
00:19:43,790 --> 00:19:45,230
We're going
to my mom's for dinner.

411
00:19:45,290 --> 00:19:47,860
Oh, how nice.

412
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,650
Now be honest with me, Charlie.

413
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:50,970
You're so dark and handsome,

414
00:19:51,030 --> 00:19:54,370
you gotta have some dago
in ya, right?

415
00:19:57,300 --> 00:20:00,410
God, I love your mom.

416
00:20:00,470 --> 00:20:02,340
♪ Men.

417
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:09,320
That was the worst dinner
of my life.

418
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:10,620
Really?

419
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:12,690
I thought the two moms
hit it off.

420
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:15,720
Kinda country mouse, city mouse.

421
00:20:15,790 --> 00:20:17,120
I especially liked
the part

422
00:20:17,190 --> 00:20:20,290
when country mouse
kicked off her shoes,

423
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:24,370
put her big yellow bunions
on city mouse's
mahogany coffee table

424
00:20:24,430 --> 00:20:29,400
and asked her how she liked
having a commie A-rab
for a president.

425
00:20:29,470 --> 00:20:32,540
You've made your point, Charlie.

426
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:35,530
Point?
Whatever do you mean?

427
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:38,640
You leave my mother alone,
and I'll leave yours alone.

428
00:20:38,710 --> 00:20:40,210
Well, gosh, I don't know.

429
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:42,420
I've really taken
a shine to your mom.

430
00:20:43,350 --> 00:20:44,390
She promised to teach me

431
00:20:44,450 --> 00:20:46,790
how to chew tobacco
and burn a cross.

432
00:20:46,850 --> 00:20:49,160
Do we have a deal or not?

433
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:50,930
Deal. Come here.

434
00:20:50,990 --> 00:20:52,960
I'm not in the mood.

435
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:55,650
All right, but don't be
rubbing up against me

436
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:57,650
in the middle
of the night.

437
00:20:57,730 --> 00:20:59,400
Don't worry. I won't.

438
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:01,290
Good night.

439
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:02,760
Good night.

440
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:13,940
All right, I was bluffing.

441
00:21:14,010 --> 00:21:16,310
Feel free to rub.

442
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:19,090
Rub yourself.

443
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:22,720
Chels?

444
00:21:22,790 --> 00:21:24,260
What?

445
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:34,320
Can you watch me
so it's not weird?
