Yeah?

You okay?

7
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:23,790
I think I'm coming down
with a cold.

That doesn't sound
like a cold,

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,640
it sounds like quitting
time in Bedrock.

11
00:00:32,710 --> 00:00:34,380
Do I feel hot to you?

12
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:35,840
Let me see.

13
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:36,850
Stop it.

14
00:00:36,910 --> 00:00:39,240
You're supposed
to feel my head.

15
00:00:39,310 --> 00:00:42,110

00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:46,050
Maybe I should go home.

Well, if you think that's
the right thing to do.

19
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:50,430
Charlie, it's the middle
of the night and I'm sick.

20
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:51,850
I'm not going home.

21
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:54,070
Then why'd you
say you were?

22
00:00:54,130 --> 00:00:55,430
I was testing you.

23
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:57,600
Yeah, well, I knew that

24
00:00:57,670 --> 00:00:59,640
and I was testing you.

25
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:02,630
I think we both
did very well.

26
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:05,470
(coughing)

27
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:06,810
Tell you what,

28
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:08,640
you get a good
night's sleep.

29
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:10,320
I'm sure you'll feel better
in the morning.

30
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:11,750
Where are you going?

31
00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:13,510
I'm gonna go crash on the couch,

32
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:14,940
let you have the whole bed
to yourself.

33
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:17,220
Really? You're gonna
leave me here alone?

34
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:20,480
No, no, I just thought you might
want your own space.

35
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:23,520
You know, when dogs are sick,

36
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:25,190
they hide till
they feel better.

37
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:30,330
Probably why they're
man's best friend.

38
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,740
Could you please stay?

39
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:36,480
Pretty please?

40
00:01:37,370 --> 00:01:39,570
How can I say no?

41
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:43,950

Seriously, how?

42
00:01:44,010 --> 00:01:45,940
Spoon?

43
00:01:49,050 --> 00:01:52,020

all over the place.

Oh, no.
Yeah.

71
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,550
I had to wait till she
finally fell asleep

72
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:40,300
so I could get the
hell outta there

73
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,620
without pissin'
her off.

(movie plays indistinctly)

78
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:52,480
This isn't a Clint Eastwood
movie.

79
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:53,850
Yes, it is.

80
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:55,680

doesn't think

this is a Clint Eastwood movie.

what I signed on for.

88
00:04:13,890 --> 00:04:15,690
You're kidding, right?

89
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:19,160

what you signed on for.

00:04:21,530 --> 00:04:22,930
you gave her an engagement ring.

no matter what.

95

better or worse,

00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:29,740
in sickness and in health.

97

better and health.

99

Well, regardless, this could
be a real opportunity for you.

100
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:42,120
Opportunity for what,
a massive infection?

101
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:45,000
An opportunity to show her
that she can depend on you.

102
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:47,230
That you're not just there
for the good times.

Well, is she cute?

149
00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:09,340
I guess.

150
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:11,530
You, uh, you don't seem
very happy about it.

151
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,670
I'm not.

152
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:14,550
Why? What's the problem?

153
00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:16,350
She's nine.

154
00:07:18,610 --> 00:07:20,340
Nine?

155
00:07:20,410 --> 00:07:22,110
Where would you meet a
nine-year-old girl?

156
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:25,050
We're in the same math class.

157

Is, uh, is she one of those
advanced students?

158

Sadly, no.

159

Hey, Berta, Chelsea's
not feeling well.

161
00:07:39,470 --> 00:07:42,040
Could you make her some tea
and an English muffin?

162
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:43,800
Sure, I could.

163
00:07:46,770 --> 00:07:48,740
But you won't.

164
00:07:48,810 --> 00:07:51,450
Is that what you're saying?

165
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:54,420
Where are the
muffins?

166
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,580
In the fridge.

167
00:07:55,650 --> 00:07:56,990
As always.

168
00:07:57,050 --> 00:07:59,080
Don't condescend to me.

169
00:07:59,150 --> 00:08:00,850
He does it to me all the time.

170
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:02,420
It's very irritating.

171
00:08:02,490 --> 00:08:04,260
No one's talking to you.

172
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:05,220
See? Like that.

173
00:08:05,290 --> 00:08:07,060
That wasn't condescending.

174
00:08:07,130 --> 00:08:08,700
But that was, right?

175
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:11,660
Right...

176
00:08:11,730 --> 00:08:14,930
Boy, as soon as I get my
license, I am so outta here.

177
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,270
Sure. You can drive your
girlfriend to Gymboree.

178
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:20,980
At least I have a girlfriend.

179
00:08:24,110 --> 00:08:26,240
(mocking):
At least I have a girlfriend.

180
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:29,540
So what's the deal?

181
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:30,820
Does, uh, Chelsea have a cold?

182
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:31,980
I'm not sure.

183
00:08:32,050 --> 00:08:34,520
Cold, flu, something disgusting.

184
00:08:34,590 --> 00:08:37,430
Maybe she has an STD.

185
00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:39,120

366
00:15:59,470 --> 00:16:01,770
No, they're
delightful.

367
00:16:02,970 --> 00:16:04,710
I'm thinking that
sooner or later,

368
00:16:04,770 --> 00:16:06,800
Chelsea's gonna want
to move in with me.

369
00:16:06,870 --> 00:16:09,470
Yeah, if you marry her,
that's a chance you take.

370
00:16:10,910 --> 00:16:14,580
And she's probably gonna
want to bring Sir Craps-a-lot.

371
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:17,620
You never know.

372
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:20,350
He might want
to get his own place.

373
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:23,690
I'm guessing he will
before you will.

374
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:25,530
Oh, Lord.

375
00:16:25,590 --> 00:16:27,920
This cat's been eating more
than kibble.

376
00:16:27,990 --> 00:16:29,990
This turd's got feathers.

377
00:16:33,130 --> 00:16:35,830
You know, there's a real chance
that someday,

378
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:37,970
without any kind
of warning whatsoever,

379
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:40,550
Chelsea will up and decide
to get sick again.

380
00:16:40,610 --> 00:16:42,810
And we're on the air
with codeine and bourbon.

381
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:44,980
Go ahead, caller.

382
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:47,880
I'm just saying, I don't think
I can go through it again.

383
00:16:47,950 --> 00:16:49,690
I'm not cut out
to be a caregiver.

384
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:51,760
Well, you might not think so,
but you're doing it.

385
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:54,160
I mean, you, Charlie Harper,
are unselfishly taking care

386
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:55,450
of the woman you love.

387
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:57,750
Maybe so, but...

388
00:16:57,820 --> 00:17:00,120
it's getting harder and harder
to love her.

389
00:17:00,190 --> 00:17:01,490
You don't mean that.

390
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:03,460
Oh, Alan,

391
00:17:03,530 --> 00:17:05,790
if you'd seen and heard
the things I have

392
00:17:05,870 --> 00:17:10,110
in the last 24 hours, it'd turn
you gayer than a French horn.

393
00:17:10,170 --> 00:17:13,410
Excuse me,
but I have witnessed childbirth.

394
00:17:13,470 --> 00:17:15,540
I saw my son's enormous head
poke out

395
00:17:15,610 --> 00:17:18,420
of what used to be one
of my very favorite places.

396
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:21,190
Thanks for the image.

397
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:24,760
I'll never be able to watch
the kid pull on a sweater again.

398
00:17:25,990 --> 00:17:28,090
Trust me. If you hang in there
and show Chelsea

399
00:17:28,150 --> 00:17:30,850
that you'll stick by her
even when she's not at her best,

400
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:32,620
she will love you more deeply
and intensely

401
00:17:32,690 --> 00:17:34,120
than you ever
could have imagined.

403
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:37,700

Oh.

00:17:41,130 --> 00:17:43,130
This is not a kitty cat.

go near sick women.

Just remember,
when it comes to nurturing,

427
00:18:36,790 --> 00:18:39,000
Charlie's like a dog
playing the piano.

You can't fault him

whiz all over the keys.

this ain't no hotel.
