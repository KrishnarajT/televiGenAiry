1
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:10,420
It's Mom.

2
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:12,520
Say hi for me.

3
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:13,520
Hi, Mom.

4
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:15,980
Alan wants to talk to you.

5
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:20,450
Hi, Mom.

6
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:22,250
How was Dubai?

7
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:25,020
Oh, good,
I-I'm glad you met somebody.

8
00:00:25,090 --> 00:00:30,190
Yes, yes,
they are a hairy people.

9
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:33,760
Uh, yeah, I-I don't need
to know any more details,

10
00:00:33,830 --> 00:00:36,230
as long as he makes you happy.

11
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:39,570
That's a detail, Mom.

12
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:41,380
Oh, no, d-don't worry
about your house.

13
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:44,270
I, uh, I check on it every day
on my way home from work.

14
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:46,740
Yeah, now,
that's why I'm the good son.

15
00:00:46,810 --> 00:00:47,810
(chuckles)

16
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:50,810
Well, uh...
have fun with Hamid.

17
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:54,250
That's another detail, Mom.

18
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,420
Yeah, I'll, uh,
I'll see you tomorrow.

19
00:00:56,490 --> 00:00:58,260
Okay, bye-bye.

20
00:00:58,330 --> 00:01:00,730
You haven't been
to her house once, have you?

21
00:01:00,790 --> 00:01:02,190
I checked on it
with Google Earth.

22
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:03,630
It's still there.

23
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:05,770
At least the
roof is anyway.

24
00:01:05,830 --> 00:01:07,230
I'll just run over today

25
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:09,860
and pick up the newspapers
and the mail, and, uh,

26
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:11,410
replace the
dead plants.

27
00:01:11,470 --> 00:01:13,340
You don't think
she'll notice new plants?

28
00:01:13,410 --> 00:01:16,610
Nah, she doesn't pay that much
attention to living things.

29
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:17,850
Remember when she had
the cockatoo?

30
00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:19,870
Oh, yeah.

31
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:22,990
Polly really wanted a cracker.

32
00:01:23,050 --> 00:01:25,650
Hey, listen, as long as you're
going to be in Beverly Hills,

33
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:27,590
you can drop my Mercedes off
at the dealership for service.

34
00:01:27,650 --> 00:01:29,780
Happy to do it.
Hey, I don't want to hear it.

35
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:31,130
You and your kid
live here rent-free.

36
00:01:31,190 --> 00:01:32,190
I don't ask for
much in return,

37
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:33,430
so the least you
could do for me,

38
00:01:33,490 --> 00:01:34,690
Alan...
Charlie, Charlie.

39
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:36,120
I said I'm happy to do it.

40
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:39,090
Oh.

41
00:01:39,170 --> 00:01:41,940
Damn, I was all set
to bust your balls.

42
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,630
Sorry to disappoint you.

43
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:48,170
And just so we're clear,
my car is cherry,

44
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,270
so if you bang it,
ding it, dent it,

45
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:51,710
or even change the
ass-print in the seat,

46
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:53,450
just keep driving
till you get to Mexico,

47
00:01:53,510 --> 00:01:55,180
then bury yourself
in the desert.

48
00:01:57,080 --> 00:02:00,010
I understand your concern,
and trust me,

49
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:01,790
I will be very careful.

50
00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:06,250
You know, you're taking
all the fun out of this.

51
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:11,940
Okay, "get car serviced."

52
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,640
Check.

53
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:17,530
What's next?

54
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:18,930
Oh, nap time.

00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:30,490

You okay?

69
00:03:13,130 --> 00:03:16,030
No, I landed
on my ass bone.

70
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:17,670
Sack up. You'll be fine.

71
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:21,360
Would you grab my sunglasses
while you're down there?

72
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:25,710
"Recover sunglasses."

73
00:03:25,770 --> 00:03:27,100
Check.

74
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:31,020
Thanks.

75
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,980
What's so interesting
over there?

76
00:03:33,050 --> 00:03:34,650
Nothing.

77
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:38,010
Hey, you know the rule:
if there's topless sunbathers,

78
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,220
you don't hang out
and stare at them.

79
00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:41,960
You come get your
Uncle Charlie.

80
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:44,650
Nobody's topless.

81
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:45,890
Oh.

82
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:49,600
Then what are
you looking at?

83
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:52,860
Son of a bitch.

84
00:03:52,930 --> 00:03:54,960
Uncheck.

85
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:57,330
Just some new neighbors.

86
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,270
New neighbors, huh?

87
00:03:58,340 --> 00:03:59,540
What's the deal?

88
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:01,180
They making s'mores
on the barbecue?

89
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:03,170
No.
Chicken?

90
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:05,210
It has nothing
to do with food.

91
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,850
Oh... a girl.

92
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:09,990
Is she cute?

93
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:11,160
No, I'm hanging
off the balcony

94
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:14,060
to look at a mutant.

95
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,420
Don't get snippy.

96
00:04:15,490 --> 00:04:17,630
I was just showing
an interest.

97
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:19,490
Why don't you go over there
and introduce yourself?

98
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,170
I can't do that.
It'd look desperate.

99
00:04:21,230 --> 00:04:23,200
You are desperate.

100
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:25,160
Come on. We'll both go.

101
00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:25,960
Really?

102
00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:27,330
Yeah, why not?

103
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,530
I got a little window
before my next nap.

104
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,270
Thanks.

105
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:31,340
No problem.

106
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:34,170
What am I
going to say?

107
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,270
I don't know.

108
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:37,140
Try saying hello.

109
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:39,640
Hello? That's
all you got?

110
00:04:39,710 --> 00:04:43,910
That's all I got
that you can use.

111
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:46,510
♪ Men. ♪

112
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:50,030
I should have peed
before we left.

113
00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:51,200
You've just got
a nervous bladder.

114
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:52,900
Wait till you turn 40.

115
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,430
You'll feel like you have to pee
while you're still peeing.

116
00:04:57,460 --> 00:04:59,890
You ready to do this?
No.

117
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:01,940
Oh, come on, what's the worst
thing that could happen?

118
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,230
She laughs at me?

119
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:05,930
Oh, that is so sweet.

120
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:08,700
No, the worst thing
that could happen

121
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:10,820
is she falls in love
with you, you get married.

122
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,880
Ten, 12 years later she comes
to her senses, leaves you,

123
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:15,650
takes all your stuff, and you
have to go live in your car.

124
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:16,950
Whoa.

125
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:19,120
Yeah.

126
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:20,790
(doorbell rings)

127
00:05:20,850 --> 00:05:23,350
What kind of car
do you think I'll have?

128
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:27,730
Hello.

129
00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:28,920
Hi.

130
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,770
I'm Charlie Harper,
and this is Jake.

131
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:31,760
We live next door.

132
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:32,730
Right, Jake?

133
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:33,740
I'm Jake.

134
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,730
Hi, I'm Celeste.

135
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,430
I'm Jake.

136
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:39,130
Honey, is that
the cable guy?

137
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:41,110
No, Dad, it's
our neighbors.

138
00:05:41,170 --> 00:05:43,370
Jerome Burnett.

139
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,040
Hi.

140
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:47,010
Charlie Harper.

141
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:48,520
This is my nephew Jake.

142
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:50,210
We just came by to welcome you
to the neighborhood.

143
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:51,380
Well, that was
very nice of you.

144
00:05:51,450 --> 00:05:52,950
Yeah, welcome
to the neighborhood.

145
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:54,030
Bye.

146
00:05:54,090 --> 00:05:55,960
Hang on. Hang on.

147
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:57,290
Do you know who this man is?

148
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:01,000
Yeah, her dad. Bye.

149
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:02,590
This is Jerome Burnett,

150
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:05,260
one of the great NFL players
of all time.

151
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:06,860
You're very kind.
Thank you.

152
00:06:06,930 --> 00:06:09,260
You know
what his nickname was, Jake?

153
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:10,270
No.

154
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:11,480
Tell him.

155
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:19,350
Mad Dog.

156
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:22,490
That's great.

157
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:23,620
Can I use your bathroom?

158
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,780
Honey, show him
where it is.

159
00:06:25,850 --> 00:06:26,950
Come on, Jake.

160
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:30,400
Lady in the house, Jake.
Put the seat back down.

161
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:33,290
So what have you been
up to lately?

162
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,620
Oh, still working
for the Chargers.

163
00:06:34,690 --> 00:06:35,860
You know, mostly
front office stuff.

164
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:37,000
Really?

165
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:39,330
So you probably have access
to tickets and such.

166
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:41,210
I do. Do you want me
to hook you up?

167
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:43,270
Oh, gee,
I don't want to impose.

168
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:44,940
I just came by to say hello.

169
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,500
Can you get me a sky box?

170
00:06:48,410 --> 00:06:50,450
I'll see what I can do.

171
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:52,010
That'd be great.

172
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,890
And I'm guessing if a,
if a player got injured,

173
00:06:53,950 --> 00:06:56,250
you'd probably be one
of the first to know about it.

174
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:58,160
You know,
even before the, uh,

175
00:06:58,220 --> 00:07:00,390
what do you call 'em—
bookies?

176
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:03,750
Don't push it, Charlie.

177
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:04,990
Hey, Dad, would
it be all right

178
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:07,230
if Jake and I take
a walk on the beach?

179
00:07:07,290 --> 00:07:08,560
Yeah, sure, why not?

180
00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:11,640

182
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:20,900
That boy touches
my daughter,

183
00:07:20,970 --> 00:07:23,470
I'm going to be
touching you.

184
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:26,270
Understood.

191
00:07:41,890 --> 00:07:44,760
I wonder what they're serving
at the domestic dealerships.

192
00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:46,590
They do take good care
of you here.

193
00:07:46,670 --> 00:07:47,770
Of course, they ought to,

194
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:49,760

for our cars.

195
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:50,580
Oh, yeah.

196
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:51,580
They are expensive.

How do you like it?

200
00:08:00,450 --> 00:08:02,450
What's not to like?

201
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:03,420
It does everything
but trim your toenails.

00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:08,030
Or maybe it does and I just
haven't found the button yet.

204
00:08:09,090 --> 00:08:11,900
Not that I need
to trim my toenails.

205
00:08:13,090 --> 00:08:15,020

So you live around here, Alan?

212
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:28,800
Uh, no,
I live down by the beach.

213
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:31,280

we just call it "the Boo."

You know, like, "Hey,
how are things down at the Boo?"

220
00:08:47,590 --> 00:08:50,160
Mr. Harper,
your car is ready.

221
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:52,370
Oh, uh, thank you.
I'll, uh, I'll be right there.

00:08:52,430 --> 00:08:54,900
Well, uh, looks
like I'm all done here.

223
00:08:54,970 --> 00:08:57,480
Guess I'll, uh,
head back to the Boo.

224
00:08:57,540 --> 00:08:58,680
Don't rub it in.

225
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:00,480
They told me
I'd be here all day.

226
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:02,000
Oh, that's terrible.

227
00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:03,240
And I'm starving.

228
00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:05,450
Oh, well, they have
the little croissants

229
00:09:05,510 --> 00:09:07,540
and the, uh, and the
chocolate chip cookies.

230
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:14,160
Or, uh, maybe I could take you
out for a nice lunch.

231
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,280
That would be lovely, Alan.

232
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:16,420

00:14:15,150 --> 00:14:16,980

331
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:20,690
Make it quick.

332
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:22,700
Okay, here's the deal.

333
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:24,860
Jake is harmless.

334
00:14:24,930 --> 00:14:26,860
You don't have
a thing to worry about,

335
00:14:26,930 --> 00:14:29,260
unless your daughter's
made out of doughnuts.

336
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:33,840
Which I'm assuming she's not.

337
00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:36,740
Look, Celeste is all I've got.

338
00:14:36,810 --> 00:14:39,020
You don't know what it's like
being a single father.

339
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:41,450
You're right. I don't.

340
00:14:41,510 --> 00:14:42,880
But I do know what it's like

341
00:14:42,950 --> 00:14:45,190
to exploit women
with daddy issues.

342
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:47,920
What the hell are you
talking about?

343
00:14:47,990 --> 00:14:50,390
Believe me, if you don't
trust your daughter

344
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:52,530
to make her own decisions,
if you try to control her life,

345
00:14:52,590 --> 00:14:54,060
she's just going
to grow up to resent you.

346
00:14:54,130 --> 00:14:55,800
And the next
thing you know,

347
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:57,760
she'll be trying
to punish you by going out

348
00:14:57,830 --> 00:15:01,260
with some weaselly little
con artist like, well, me.

349
00:15:03,970 --> 00:15:05,870
And you can't kill us all.

350
00:15:07,510 --> 00:15:10,110
I can try.

351
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:13,610
Let me start again.

352
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:17,550

Uh, uh, uh, are you sure
this is what you want?

353
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:19,890
Oh, yeah, baby.

354
00:15:19,950 --> 00:15:23,480
It's always been
one of my fantasies.

355
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:24,600
Oh, okay.

356
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:26,060
