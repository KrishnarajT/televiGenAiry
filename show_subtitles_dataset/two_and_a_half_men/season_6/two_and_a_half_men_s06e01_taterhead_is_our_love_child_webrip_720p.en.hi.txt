1
00:00:06,190 --> 00:00:07,390
Look at him.

2
00:00:07,460 --> 00:00:08,960
He can type 80 words a minute
with his thumb,

3
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:11,020
but he can't pee without
hitting the shower curtain.

4
00:00:11,090 --> 00:00:16,460
Fortunately, typing is
a job skill and peeing is not.

5
00:00:16,530 --> 00:00:20,630
Oh, dude, WTH?

6
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:24,640
Oh, geez.

7
00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:25,780
What?

8
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:27,980
That woman over there.
We used to go out.

9
00:00:29,410 --> 00:00:33,040
Did it not end well?

10
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:35,080
It went fine for me.

11
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:37,720
Although, in retrospect,

12
00:00:37,790 --> 00:00:39,590
I guess I could
have handled our parting

13
00:00:39,650 --> 00:00:41,980
with a little more tact
and sensitivity

14
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:44,660
and a little less, you
know, banging her best friend.

15
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:46,160
Oh, God!

16
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:48,770
Hey, hey, her friend was
a double-jointed sex freak

17
00:00:48,830 --> 00:00:51,040
with daddy issues—
what was I supposed to do?

18
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:53,810
You're right.
Your hands were tied.

19
00:00:53,870 --> 00:00:55,710
That, too.

20
00:00:55,770 --> 00:00:57,640
So, how long ago was this?

21
00:00:57,710 --> 00:01:00,910
Her or the friend? 'Cause
there was a brief overlap.

22
00:01:00,970 --> 00:01:02,470
Let's go with her.

23
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:04,510
I don't know.
Eight, nine years.

24
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:06,650
So maybe she's over it.

25
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:17,100

00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:52,900
Hi.

37
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:56,790
Okay, but if she reaches
into her purse,

38
00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:58,590
I'm using numbnuts

39
00:01:58,670 --> 00:02:02,310
Hey, Chrissy.
Long time.

40
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:03,780
I know.

41
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,080
Yep, long,

42
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:08,310
long time.
Yeah.

43
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:10,050
Time is a great healer,
isn't it?

44
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:11,540
Of some things.

45
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:14,310
Hey, congratulations
on your new career.

46
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:15,580
Thank you.

Charlie Harper

48
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:19,560
is a children's
singing star.

49
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:22,020
Well, you know
how much I love kid...

50
00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:24,600
Yep, a long, long time.

51
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:29,100
Looks like your
little guy enjoys music.

52
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:30,660
Oh, yeah, he loves it.

53
00:02:30,730 --> 00:02:32,500
He's actually quite
the piano player, too.

54
00:02:32,570 --> 00:02:34,710
Piano? You hear that, Charlie?

55
00:02:34,770 --> 00:02:37,580
The young man plays
piano just like you.

56
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:39,750
Lots of kids play piano.

57
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:41,510
So, you still
living in Westwood?

58
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:42,980
Yeah. Still there.

59
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,570
We just drove down
to spend the day at the beach.

60
00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:46,220
Oh, sure. The beach.

61
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,450
Nice place to visit,

62
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:48,950
but you wouldn't want
to live there.

63
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:50,820
Actually, I do live there;
it's not that bad.

64
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:53,320
Right. Well,
we should get going.

65
00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:54,590
It was nice seeing you.

66
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:56,730
Nice to see you, too.
Come on, Chuck.

67
00:03:02,130 --> 00:03:04,070
"Chuck."

68
00:03:04,130 --> 00:03:05,630
I heard it.

69
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:07,410
Lots of kids
named Chuck.

70
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:10,640
It's a nickname
for Charles, isn't it?

71
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:12,640
So are Chaz, Chad, Chick
and Charlie. What's your point?

72
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:15,110
No point. It's just that
you haven't seen that woman

73
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:18,480
in nine years,
and little Chuck is, uh...

74
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:20,820
Well, how old do you suppose
little Chuck is?

75
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:22,580
What difference does it make?

76
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:26,480
Well, I'd say
little Chuck is, uh...

77
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:29,350
seven or eight years old,

78
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:31,490
give or take nine months.

79
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,630
What are you implying?
'Cause I don't know

80
00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:35,720
what you're talking about.
You don't?

81
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,170
Okay, I choose not to.

00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:38,390

Dad, quick,
we gotta go home!

84
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:41,630
Why, what's wrong?
My battery died.

85
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,530
Oh, no, wait.

86
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:46,500
I just turned it off
by accident.

87
00:03:46,570 --> 00:03:48,770
This wouldn't happen
if I had a smartphone.

88
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:52,040
Do I even need to say it?

89
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:55,980
So is it just me

90
00:03:56,050 --> 00:03:57,960

00:04:58,410 --> 00:05:00,510

to be covered is covered

116
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:03,510
when, you know,
covering is appropriate.

117
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:04,810

confused about the galoshes.

119
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:08,660
You know, Charlie,

120
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:11,090
even condoms
are only 98% effective.

121
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,230

122
00:05:12,290 --> 00:05:13,190

00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:18,770
It's not like a cereal box.

126
00:05:20,030 --> 00:05:21,630
You don't read it while
you're eating.

127
00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:25,430

128
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:26,750

132
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,780
You showed up at my door
with a ten-year-old

133
00:05:31,850 --> 00:05:33,290
and I hadn't seen you
in 11 years.

I've got a question
about these condoms.

146
00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:07,640
I told you, Charlie,

147
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:10,720
I'm giving you the
best bulk rate I can.

148
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:12,550
I know, but that's not
what I was...

149
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:15,160
There's just no way I
can compete with the
big chain stores.

150
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:16,520
I understand.

151
00:06:16,590 --> 00:06:17,930
So I make it up
in personal service.

152
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:19,820
I'm sure you do.
I mean, I'm not going

to unroll the damn things
and put 'em on for you,

154
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:24,530
but short of that,
I've got your back.

156
00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:28,640

157
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:30,300

158
00:06:30,370 --> 00:06:32,230

neighborhood
pharmacist anymore.

160
00:06:33,770 --> 00:06:35,470
They go on the Internet.

161
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:36,370

166
00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:48,480
No, I'm just a little
concerned about you.

167
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:51,230
Well, if you're so concerned,
help me out a little bit.

168
00:06:51,290 --> 00:06:53,660

Yeah, well,
speaking of condoms,

174
00:07:05,910 --> 00:07:08,650
I just want to know if
somebody could get pregnant

175
00:07:08,710 --> 00:07:10,250
even if you were
wearing a condom.

176
00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:12,440
Have you been talking
to the Wetzel's Pretzels lady?

177
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:16,080
Because I just gave
her a ride home, that's it.

178
00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:18,190
No, no, no,
no, I mean in general.

179
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:19,880
What are the odds
that a condom wouldn't work?

180
00:07:19,950 --> 00:07:23,250
Well, there are a number
of things to factor in.

181
00:07:26,590 --> 00:07:28,220
Oh, cough syrup?

182
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:29,730
I don't have a cough.

183
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,340
Neither do I.

184
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,060
Anyway, condoms.

185
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:38,480
Whenever you're dealing
with a manufactured product,

186
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:40,580
there's always going
to be flaws in the process.

187
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:43,240
Yeah, but aren't they supposed
to be tested before they go out?

188
00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:44,510
Or in?

189
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:47,690
Well, sure,
but they don't test every one.

190
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:48,720
They don't?

191
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:49,880
Masturbating's looking

192
00:07:49,950 --> 00:07:52,050
better and better, huh?

193
00:07:55,590 --> 00:07:57,700
Okay, okay, so bottom line,
what you're saying is

194
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:59,130
even if I'm wearing a condom,

195
00:07:59,190 --> 00:08:01,060
there's a chance I could get
someone pregnant?

196
00:08:04,330 --> 00:08:06,800
Did you miss eighth grade
health class, Charlie?

197
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:08,640
Oh, come on,
who went to health class?

198
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:09,900
Well, amongst others,

199
00:08:09,970 --> 00:08:12,000
a certain self-medicating
pharmacist

200
00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:14,070
who pays alimony
to three different women,

201
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:17,470
but not one penny
in child support.

202
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:21,180
All right, all right,
for future reference,

203
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:23,220
what about lambskin?
Are they more effective?

204
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:26,580
Well, um, less so than
your latex product.

205
00:08:26,650 --> 00:08:29,680
Now I had to stop wearing
them myself because something

206
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:32,730
about the smell
made my cat go berserk.

207
00:08:32,790 --> 00:08:34,690
It kind of a cute story.

simple principles.

224
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:21,580
One: if at all possible,
ladies first.

225
00:09:23,610 --> 00:09:27,340
Two: it's easier to be forgiven
than ask permission.

226

And third,
and most important:

227
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:34,030
the ten seconds it takes
to put on a condom

228
00:09:34,090 --> 00:09:35,760
beats the hell out
of the ten years

229

00:15:21,030 --> 00:15:23,270
science, history, phys ed.

356
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:25,140
I understand, dear.

357
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:27,540
I can't even find my locker.

358
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:30,040
All right,
I talked to her.

359
00:15:30,110 --> 00:15:31,720
You owe me five bucks.

360
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:39,280
He's a good wiper,
and I love him.

361
00:15:39,350 --> 00:15:41,080
Hey, Alan,

362
00:15:41,150 --> 00:15:43,320
I just spoke...
aw, geez.

363
00:15:43,390 --> 00:15:46,220
Good to see you, too, dear.

364
00:15:46,290 --> 00:15:47,760
What's going on, Mom?

365
00:15:47,830 --> 00:15:49,500
Nothing.

366
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:51,490
I merely stop in
to see my two sons

367
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:53,630
and my one and only grandchild.

368
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:54,960
Well, it's...

369
00:15:55,030 --> 00:15:56,460
(groans)

370
00:15:57,500 --> 00:16:00,170
So, Mom,
you're looking good.

371
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:04,120
Did you have something snipped
or tucked or sucked?

372
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:05,950
Just eyes and tush.

373
00:16:06,010 --> 00:16:07,780
But nice of you to notice.

374
00:16:07,850 --> 00:16:10,990
Hey, Charlie, did you ever find
out if that kid is yours?

375
00:16:15,190 --> 00:16:16,960
Thanks a lot, Berta.

376
00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:19,350
Oh, dear,
have I spoken out of turn?

377
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:25,190
Kid?

378
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:27,860
Yeah, well, it-it-it turns out

379
00:16:27,930 --> 00:16:31,270
that there are flaws
in every manufacturing process

380
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:34,010
and that includes your everyday
latex products.

381
00:16:34,070 --> 00:16:35,270
I see.

382
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:37,200
And how far along
is the young lady?

383
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:39,450
Oh, about eight years.

384
00:16:39,510 --> 00:16:43,380
Eight years
and she's just suing you now?

385
00:16:43,450 --> 00:16:46,050
She's not suing me.

386
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:48,130
She doesn't want to have
anything to do with me.

387
00:16:48,190 --> 00:16:49,560
Lucky you.

388
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:51,450
If I were her, I'd have owned
half this house

389
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:53,560

390
00:16:53,630 --> 00:16:55,670
Yeah, real lucky.

391
00:16:55,730 --> 00:16:57,130
I got an eight-year-old son

392
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:58,900
and I'll never get
to spend any time with him.

393
00:16:58,970 --> 00:17:02,010
Oh, sweetheart, look,
take it from me.

394
00:17:02,070 --> 00:17:06,380
Spending time with one's
children is greatly overrated.

395
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:09,970
Oh, come on, face facts.

396
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:12,770
Some people are meant to be
parents and some people aren't.

397
00:17:12,850 --> 00:17:14,150
And you have a perfect
example of that

398
00:17:14,210 --> 00:17:15,280
sitting right in front of you.

399
00:17:15,350 --> 00:17:17,920
You certainly do.

400
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:21,930
Yeah, well,
I think I'd be a great dad.

401
00:17:21,990 --> 00:17:25,900
Well, easy for you to say now
that you've dodged the bullet.

402
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:28,330
You're right,

403
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:31,400

about putting this house
in my name

00:17:36,270 --> 00:17:38,940
so it can never fall into
the hands of some money-hungry,

407
00:17:39,010 --> 00:17:40,080
manipulative bitch.

408
00:17:41,210 --> 00:17:43,420

Look, I can see

412
00:17:57,620 --> 00:17:59,720
why you might not think of
me as father material.

you'd let me,

00:18:05,430 --> 00:18:07,460
to help out a little bit.

417
00:18:08,370 --> 00:18:10,580
Oh.

This is more
than a little bit.

Hey, eight years
is a long time.

420
00:18:14,810 --> 00:18:16,910
What do you want
out of this?

421
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:19,180
I just want to know that
he's taken care of.

422
00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:21,850
And I plan on sending you
a check every month.

423
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:24,160
I-I don't know what to say.

You don't have to worry
about me interfering.

425
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:29,060
Although, there's a couple
of things you should know

426
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:30,180
for when he gets older.

427
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:32,000
Like what?

428
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:35,870
Well, you're gonna want to
lock the liquor cabinet...

429
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:38,930
But don't forget
that mouthwash

430
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,810
can also pack a
pretty good buzz.

431
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:45,680
So be on guard for
suspiciously minty breath.

432
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:49,050
Oh, and if his school nurse
is at all attractive,

433
00:18:49,110 --> 00:18:52,420
you can expect the
occasional hernia.

434
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:54,920
