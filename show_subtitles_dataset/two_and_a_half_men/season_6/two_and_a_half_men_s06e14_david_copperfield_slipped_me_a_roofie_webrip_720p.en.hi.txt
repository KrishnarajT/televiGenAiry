1
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:06,370
Would you like
the last sausage?

2
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:08,080
Oh, how about
we split it?

3
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:09,440
Okay.

4
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:10,810
Meet you in the middle.

5
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:13,110
Oh.

6
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:14,280
Okay.

7
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:15,340
Sexy.

8
00:00:21,790 --> 00:00:22,990
CHARLIE:
Aw.

9
00:00:23,050 --> 00:00:25,980
Nothing says love like
a little morning pork.

10
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:30,200
Oh, hey.

11
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:31,460
You're home early.

12
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:32,500
How was Vegas?

13
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:33,560
(sighs)

14
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:34,730
Never again.

15
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:35,600
Oh, you lost?

16
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:37,310
No, Alan.

17
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:40,340
I won so much freaking money
that I'm embarrassed to go back.

18
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:43,850
All right... well, uh,

19
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:45,880
you remember Melissa?

20
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:47,640
Of course he
remembers me, Alan.

21
00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:50,310
He deflowered me,
then dumped me.

22
00:00:51,410 --> 00:00:53,510
No offense, sweetheart,
but your flower

23
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:57,320
had been plucked and potted
long before I met you.

24
00:00:57,390 --> 00:00:58,530
Okay, okay, look.

25
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:00,230
Look, we're all adults here.

26
00:01:00,290 --> 00:01:03,260
This doesn't have
to be awkward, you know.

27
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:05,800
I mean, sure... Melissa
is my receptionist,

28
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:07,760
and sure, she was with you,

29
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:10,500
and sure, that ended badly,
but, uh ...

30
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:15,370
Okay, I guess this does have
to be awkward.

31
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:18,600
Honey, shouldn't we
be getting ready for work?

32
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:19,980
Yes, yes, let's do that.

33
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:21,810
You want to shower together?
Oh, great, great.

34
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:23,520
Uh, let me just, uh,
start without you.

35
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:26,310
There's a couple of things
I'd like to prewash.

36
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:30,630
There's a mental image
I didn't need.

37
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:32,860
Charlie, I need to talk to you.

38
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:35,100
I'm sorry I was a jerk.

39
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:36,460
I'm happy for you and Alan,

40
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:39,000
and I will kick myself
for the rest of my life

41
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:40,830
for losing someone
as special as you.

42
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:43,240
No, silly, it's about
something else.

43
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:46,230
Oh, good, 'cause evenl
didn't believe that.

44
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:50,380
Alan's birthday
is next Saturday.

45
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:51,640
Really?

46
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:52,880
I don't think so.

47
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:54,910
Yeppers. He's gonna be 40.

48
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:57,320
Wow, that is so weird.

49
00:01:57,380 --> 00:01:59,440
My baby brother's gonna be 40.

50
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:00,690
How old are you?

51
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:02,310
39.

52
00:02:03,850 --> 00:02:06,220
That's what makes it so weird.

53
00:02:06,290 --> 00:02:10,530
Anyway, I think
we should have a party for him.

54
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:11,890
Why?

55
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:14,660
Because it's an
important birthday,

56
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:16,290
and he deserves a big party

57
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:18,410
with all his friends
and loved ones.

58
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:20,380
All right... all right,
let's break this down.

59
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:22,010
You want him
to get what he deserves.

60
00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:24,270
You want it to be
with his friends and loved ones,

61
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:25,700
and you want it to be big.

62
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:28,380
Uh-huh.
Pick one.

63
00:02:28,450 --> 00:02:30,490
Come on, Charlie.
Don't be such a pooper.

64
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:33,520
If it's gonna be a fun party,
I need your help.

65
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:34,650
You want it to be fun?

66
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:35,790
Don't invite Alan.

67
00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:37,380
Charlie...
Okay.

68
00:02:37,450 --> 00:02:40,150
Okay, you know who would love
to help you out with this?

69
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:40,950
Our mom.

70
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:42,550
Really?
Oh, yeah.

71
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:43,900
Nothing she likes better

72
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,890
than extending herself
for other people.

73
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,690
Good idea.

74
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:48,760
I'll give her a call.

75
00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:50,330
You do that.

76
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:54,300
Wait till she hears Alan's 40.

She's bluffing.

Okay, don't panic.

You've experienced
oxygen deprivation before.

94
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:53,660
I can't breathe, Mom.

95
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:56,230
Oh, good, you're awake.

96
00:03:57,870 --> 00:03:59,510
What can I do for you?

97
00:03:59,570 --> 00:04:03,550
I received a very unsettling
message on my answering machine,

98
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:05,780
and I would like you
to explain it to me.

99
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,540
Okay, look.

100
00:04:07,610 --> 00:04:11,210
Sometimes the liquor
makes me say hateful things.

101
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:15,010
No, this message was from
some woman named Melissa.

102
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:16,860
Alan's receptionist.

103
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,560
Really?

104
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:21,050
From the sound of her voice,
I'd guess she earns her living

105
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,220
baking cookies in a hollow tree.

106
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:27,470
Anyway, she's somehow gotten it
into her head

107
00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:30,060
that Alan is turning 40
on Saturday.

108
00:04:30,130 --> 00:04:31,400
Yeah, so?

109
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:32,710
Is she insane?

110
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:35,780
Running around telling people
my son is 40?

111
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:36,910
I know.

112
00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:38,740
She's a bad person.

113
00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:41,840
That's not all.

114
00:04:41,910 --> 00:04:44,180
She wants me to help
with a party.

115
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:46,390
Where in God's name

116
00:04:46,450 --> 00:04:50,130
could she have gotten
such an idea?

117
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:52,360
Beats me.

118
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:54,820
Maybe the fact
that you're his mother

119
00:04:54,890 --> 00:04:57,620
confused the poor girl.

120
00:04:57,690 --> 00:04:59,060

00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:05,640
Oh, you're up.

You've been cleaning
in there this whole time?

123
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:11,580
Sure, let's say I was cleaning.

124
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:13,070
Hey, Uncle Charlie,
if you're going out today,

125
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:14,770
can I pull your car out
of the garage?

126
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:17,680
No, I don't want you pulling
my car out of the garage.

127
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:18,850
Okay, I won't.

128
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:21,190
From now on.

129
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:24,490

00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:25,950

00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:19,030
(chuckling)

183
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:21,230
We got a private room.

184
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:23,130
Go back to your dinner.

185
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:24,950
Ooh, gazpacho.

186
00:07:27,210 --> 00:07:28,910
This is so nice.

187
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:31,920
(loudly):
A private, intimate dinner
for just the two of us.

188
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:35,410
Oh, my God, you guys!

189
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:41,750
There's nobody here.

190
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:42,690
I don't understand it.

191
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:44,770
I told them
to be here an hour ago.

192
00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:46,570
Yeah, well, what
are you gonna do?

193
00:07:46,630 --> 00:07:48,900
My family are a bunch
of thoughtless,

194
00:07:48,970 --> 00:07:50,940
selfish butt-wipes.

195
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,570
Surprise.

196
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,340
♪ Men.

197
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:02,440
MELISSA:
Evelyn, smile.

198
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:05,820
That's a keeper.

199
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:08,680
Listen, darling, are you going
to be cutting the cake soon?

200
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:10,920
Because, actually,
I have a real party to go to.

201
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:12,260
You can't go.

202
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:14,250
We haven't even done
the speeches yet.

203
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:16,250
Oh, of course.

204
00:08:17,290 --> 00:08:19,220
Were we supposed
to write speeches?

205
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:20,270
For what?

206
00:08:20,330 --> 00:08:21,460
For Alan.

207
00:08:21,530 --> 00:08:24,000
Let him write
his own speech.

208
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:25,240
(glass clinking)

209
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:27,730
Uh, can I have
your attention, please?

210
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,470
I want to thank you
all for coming

211
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:31,480
to celebrate this
wonderful occasion.

212
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:33,470
I thought
it was Alan's birthday.

213
00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:38,140
And now it's time
to say a few words

214
00:08:38,210 --> 00:08:39,980
about the guest of honor.

215
00:08:40,050 --> 00:08:41,820
I can think of a few words.

216
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:43,150
(chuckling)

217
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:45,790
Not only is he
a terrific doctor

218
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:47,460
and fantastic boss,

219
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:50,560
he is also good
and kind and smart

220
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:53,840
and funny... and...

221
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:55,870
a really swell kisser.

222
00:08:55,930 --> 00:08:57,560
I can still hear you.

223
00:08:57,630 --> 00:08:58,530
WOMAN:
Sorry I'm late.

224
00:08:58,600 --> 00:08:59,860
I was burning a fatty

225
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:02,740
with one of the busboys
in the parking lot.

226
00:09:02,810 --> 00:09:04,850
How are you?

227
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:07,680
Everyone, this is
my mother, Shelly.

228
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:09,870
Mom, this is Alan's
mother, Evelyn, and...

229
00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:12,320
Sweetie, save your breath,
because I'm way too toasted

230
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:14,380
to remember a lot of names.

231
00:09:14,450 --> 00:09:15,880
(giggling)

232
00:09:15,950 --> 00:09:17,650
Ooh, bread.

233
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:25,500
All right, well, uh,
now that we're all here,

234
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:27,530
why don't we take turns
saying something

235
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,740
about Alan and how much
he means to us.

236
00:09:32,570 --> 00:09:33,780
Okay, Jake, you
want to start?

237
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,910
No, I got to go make room
for cake.

238
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:41,110
Uh, Berta, why don't you
get the ball rolling?

239
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:42,880
Sure.

240
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:44,320
What the hell?

241
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:48,090
Zippy, I got to tell you,

242
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:51,280
when you first moved in,
I didn't really care for you.

243
00:09:51,350 --> 00:09:52,420
(chuckling)

244
00:09:52,490 --> 00:09:53,630
You were a persnickety,

245
00:09:53,690 --> 00:09:56,450
self-righteous,
smug son of a bitch.

246
00:09:57,190 --> 00:09:58,190
And now

247
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:00,090
here we are, six years later.

248
00:10:01,230 --> 00:10:02,930
Thank you.

249
00:10:06,070 --> 00:10:07,910
Hear, hear.

250
00:10:09,010 --> 00:10:10,080
Oh, okay.

251
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:11,810
Anyone else?
SHELLY:
Okay.

252
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:13,510
I'll go.

253
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:18,250
I have pictures of myself

254
00:10:18,310 --> 00:10:20,650
dressed in a forest ranger
uniform,

255
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,790
and I have absolutely no memory

256
00:10:22,850 --> 00:10:26,020
of ever working
as a forest ranger.

257
00:10:26,090 --> 00:10:27,900
Thank you.

258
00:10:31,290 --> 00:10:34,060
All righty.

259
00:10:34,130 --> 00:10:36,230
Uh, who's next?

260
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:37,200
Evelyn?

261
00:10:37,270 --> 00:10:38,470
Me?

262
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:39,740
Isn't it enough
I carried him

263
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:41,230
for seven and
a half months?

264
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:42,430
You'd be surprised
how many women

265
00:10:42,510 --> 00:10:44,410
opt for the full nine.

266
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:47,040
Come on, Evelyn, you
have to say something.

267
00:10:47,110 --> 00:10:49,450
Oh, fine.

268
00:10:49,510 --> 00:10:50,840
Alan, darling.

269
00:10:52,050 --> 00:10:53,890
You were always
the good son.

270
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:59,120
Of course, your brother
didn't set the bar very high.

271
00:10:59,190 --> 00:11:01,530
Hear, hear.
Wait a minute.

272
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:04,530
Charlie, do you want
to say anything?

273
00:11:04,590 --> 00:11:07,360
Uh, all right.

274
00:11:07,430 --> 00:11:09,790
(clears throat)

275
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:12,470
Alan, you're my little brother.

276
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:14,380
And I know
over the years

277
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:15,810
I've tormented you.

278
00:11:15,870 --> 00:11:17,470
I've embarrassed you in public.

279
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:20,540
I've tied you
to streetlights, car bumpers,

280
00:11:20,610 --> 00:11:22,910
the occasional angry animal...

281
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:26,990
Oh, remember that Fourth of July
when I used your ass

282
00:11:27,050 --> 00:11:28,560
as a launch pad
for my bottle rockets?

283
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:30,120
(chuckles)

284
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:33,660
Anyway, I guess
what I'm trying to say is...

285
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:35,590
thanks for the memories.

286
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:41,330
That's it?

287
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:42,900
That's all you
have to say?

288
00:11:42,970 --> 00:11:46,640
I suppose I could talk
about his bed-wetting.

289
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:50,180
You people are horrible.

290
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:51,380
No. Honey, it's okay.

291
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:53,400
No-no-no-no,
it's not okay.

292
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:55,350
You should be ashamed
of yourselves.

293
00:11:55,410 --> 00:11:57,610
This is a warm
and wonderful human being

294
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:00,180
and he deserves more,
especially from his family.

295
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:02,520
I don't even know why you
guys showed up tonight.

296
00:12:02,590 --> 00:12:04,430
Well, I can't speak
for anybody else,

297
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:05,890
but I'm getting overtime.

298
00:12:07,690 --> 00:12:09,390
Come on, Alan.
We're leaving.

299
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:11,030
Really? Before the cake?

300
00:12:11,090 --> 00:12:13,160
You don't need people
who don't appreciate you.

301
00:12:13,230 --> 00:12:16,300
Uh, well, no, but I do
kind of need Charlie's house.

302
00:12:16,370 --> 00:12:17,710
No, you don't.

303
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:20,070
You'll come live with me
and Mom. Right, Mom?

304
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:23,780
You know, I did spend a summer
in Yosemite doing shrooms,

305
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:27,000
so maybe I wasn't
an official forest ranger.

306
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:29,370
Let's go.

307
00:12:29,450 --> 00:12:30,790
Mom, we're leaving.

308
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:32,190
Okay.

309
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:35,060
I'm sorry. This is
the best bread I ever had.

310
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:43,500
Who likes magic?

311
00:12:45,090 --> 00:12:47,530
I shaved for this?

312
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:52,740
♪ Men. ♪

313
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:12,380
Berta?

314
00:13:12,450 --> 00:13:14,950
Who's asking?

315
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:16,420
What's wrong?

316
00:13:16,490 --> 00:13:18,260
Too much celebrating last night.

317
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:21,440
I didn't notice you
drinking at Alan's party.

318
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:23,540
No, afterward.

319
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,530
With the magician at his place.

320
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:29,600
You went back to his place?

321
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:31,900
Well, technically, his van.

322
00:13:33,510 --> 00:13:35,380
Well, why didn't you
just stay home?

323
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,840
If I stay home,
you don't pay me.

324
00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:42,120
So you just came in
to lie on my couch?

325
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:44,250
Tough times, Charlie.

326
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:47,250
Some people are living
in their vans.

327
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:49,250
(phone ringing)

328
00:13:49,330 --> 00:13:51,070
Oh, make it stop!

329
00:13:56,230 --> 00:13:57,430
Hello?

330
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:59,740
Hi, Mom.

331
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:01,930
Alan? Nah, he didn't come home.

332
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:04,150
You're right.

333
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:05,210
We were funny.

334
00:14:05,270 --> 00:14:07,100
He just overreacted.

335
00:14:08,510 --> 00:14:10,680
I'm sure
he'll come back eventually.

336
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:12,050
He always does.

337
00:14:12,110 --> 00:14:14,680
You should've named him
"Herpes."

338
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:23,630
Yeah, I wish I'd thought
of it last night, too.

339
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:28,090
Talk to you later.

340
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:30,130
So what are we going
to do today?

341
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:32,770
Aren't you going
to ask about your dad?

342
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:34,340
What about him?

343
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:37,800
Were we not at the same party
last night?

344
00:14:37,870 --> 00:14:39,270
Did you not notice

345
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:40,570
when you finally came out
of the toilet

346
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:42,240
that your father was gone?

347
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:46,020
You know,
now that you mention it...

348
00:14:48,650 --> 00:14:51,180
Herpes, Jr.

349
00:14:56,590 --> 00:14:58,620
Oh.

350
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:00,100
Look who's back.

351
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:00,990
I'm not back.

352
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:02,330
I just came to get my stuff.

353
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:04,570
You're really going
to milk this thing, huh?

354
00:15:04,630 --> 00:15:05,400
I'm not milking anything,
Charlie.

355
00:15:05,470 --> 00:15:06,810
There is no milk.

356
00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:08,610
I'm moving in with Melissa
and her mother.

357
00:15:08,670 --> 00:15:10,270
Sounds like milk to me.

358
00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:14,050
I need to be someplace
where I'm appreciated,

359
00:15:14,110 --> 00:15:17,270
someplace where
I'm nurtured and loved.

360
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:19,250
(mooing)

361
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:25,460
You're not taking me
