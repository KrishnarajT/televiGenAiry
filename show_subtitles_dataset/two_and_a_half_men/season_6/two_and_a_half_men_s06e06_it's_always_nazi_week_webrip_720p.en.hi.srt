1
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:04,900
(doorbell chiming)

2
00:00:07,460 --> 00:00:08,720
Oh, hey, alan.

3
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:10,900
Jake, your dad's here.

4
00:00:11,830 --> 00:00:13,630
So, how's it going?

5
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:14,960
All good.

6
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:16,370
Good.

7
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:17,740
You?
Good.

8
00:00:17,810 --> 00:00:19,440
Well, good.

9
00:00:20,170 --> 00:00:22,770
Yeah, good.

10
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:27,890
Gooood.

11
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:33,650
Well, i, uh, i see you
put in a new mailbox.

12
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:35,720
Oh, yeah, the old one
was pretty shoddy.

13
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:38,360
Whoever put it in didn't
anchor the pole correctly.

14
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:40,470
That would be me.

15
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:41,970
Oh, sorry.

16
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:44,100
The mailman was complaining
about the wiggle.

17
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:46,030
Herb, the mailman's a pothead.

18
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:48,840
Yeah, i know. I caught him
eating my tomato plants.

19
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:51,330
Anyway, i just decided
to replace the whole thing.

20
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:54,140
Yeah, i see it, uh,
it now says "the melnicks."

21
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:56,410
Well, i paid for the mailbox.

22
00:00:57,740 --> 00:00:59,540
I get my mail there.

23
00:00:59,610 --> 00:01:00,480
My name's melnick...

24
00:01:00,550 --> 00:01:03,790
Yeah, i... I get it.

25
00:01:03,850 --> 00:01:05,980
Charlie harper.

26
00:01:06,050 --> 00:01:07,980
Oh.

27
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:10,230
Jake!

28
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:12,920
No need to yell.
He's in the bathroom.

29
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:14,460
Big surprise, eh?

30
00:01:14,530 --> 00:01:17,100
He's either shoveling it in
or shooting it out.

31
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:21,330
Yeah, he's a regular play-Doh
fun factory.

32
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:23,700
Just go make sure he hasn't
fallen asleep in there again.

33
00:01:23,770 --> 00:01:24,900
Yes, dear.

34
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:28,610
So, how's everything?

35
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:30,280
Fine.

36
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:33,010
Listen, alan, i've been thinking
now that jake's a teenager,

37
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:35,580
He'd benefit from spending
some more time with his dad.

38
00:01:35,650 --> 00:01:37,160
Oh, oh, that would be great.

39
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:38,460
Nothing would make me happier

40
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:40,430
Than to spending more time
with my son.

41
00:01:40,490 --> 00:01:42,090
Good.

42
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:42,760
Hey, dad.

43
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:43,820
Oh, hey, buddy.

44
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:44,720
All finished
in the bathroom?

45
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:45,990
For now.

46
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:47,670
You should've
seen the last one.

47
00:01:47,730 --> 00:01:49,270
It looked like
a question mark.

48
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:52,690
Terrific.

49
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:54,440
And it came out of my colon.

50
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:55,530
Get it?

51
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:56,800
Hilarious.

52
00:01:56,870 --> 00:01:57,670
Commas are easy.

53
00:01:57,740 --> 00:01:59,310
Go.

54
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:04,520
Um, so, uh, what are we
talking about here?

55
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:06,220
You know, an extra day or two
every other week?

56
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:08,690
Actually, i was thinking more
like a solid three months.

57
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:09,750
In a row?

58
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:11,490
Alan, how many sons do you have?

59
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:12,610
As many as you do.

60
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:14,260
Look, do you want
your kid or not?

61
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:17,920
Of course, but... Well, i'll
have to clear it with charlie,

62
00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:20,420
And... And there is
the financial issue.

63
00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:21,860
What financial issue?

64
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:23,240
Well, if he's going
to be living with me,

65
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:24,140
I'm thinking i should
get a sizeable break

66
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,540
On the child support.

67
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:27,840
Well, you're certainly entitled
to your opinion.

68
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:29,000
Well, thank you.

69
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:39,550
Wait a minute.

70
00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:42,710
Three months in a row?

71
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:45,480
Come on.
It'll be fun.
For who?

72
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:48,280
All he does is eat, sleep
and clog up the toilets.

73
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,160
Shh!

74
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:50,520
Let's talk
about this later.

75
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:52,720
Oh, please, chowderhead
can't hear us.

76
00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:53,920
Right, chowderhead?

77
00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:55,170
See?

78
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:59,490
Oh, just admit it:
you love having him around.

79
00:02:59,570 --> 00:03:03,240
I love having him around because
i always know he's leaving.

80
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:06,570
Don't take the leaving part
away from me, alan.

81
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:07,580
Let's just give it a chance.

82
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:09,040
See how it works.

83
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:11,350
That's what poland said
about the germans.

84
00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:14,040
Been watching
the history channel again?

85
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:16,010
It's nazi week.

86
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,050
It's always nazi week.

87
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,590
Look, tell you what,

88
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:21,680
Why don't i take you and jake
out to dinner tonight?

89
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:23,690

The three harper boys
sitting around the campfire,

Putting on the feedbag.

100
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,100
Yeah, bite me.

101

So, numbnuts...

102
00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:15,810
Any thoughts as to why your mom
dumped you off on us?

103
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:16,910
Charlie.

104
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:18,620
Oh, like you're not curious.

105
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:20,420
No! No, i'm not curious.

106
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:22,080
She just thought
it would be a good idea

107
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:23,560
For him to spend more time
with his father.

108
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:25,060
Yeah, and i'm trying
to save girls

109
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,730
A long ride home on the freeway.

110
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:31,430
So what's your theory, alfalfa?

111
00:04:31,490 --> 00:04:33,260
I think you're just pretending
to be considerate

112
00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:34,770
So you can have sex with them.

113
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:42,340
No, no, i mean
about your mother and herb.

114
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:43,130
Oh.

115
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,670
They are fighting a lot.

116
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:45,580
They're fighting?

117
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:46,580
Yep.

118
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:48,180
31.

119
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,320
31?

120
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:54,050
It's what you get when you add
24 and seven.

121
00:04:56,050 --> 00:04:58,790
You know, they're fighting
all the time.

122
00:04:58,850 --> 00:04:59,950
24/7.

123
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:01,630
31.

124
00:05:01,690 --> 00:05:04,230
I'm not gonna make it
three months, alan.

125
00:05:04,290 --> 00:05:05,390
You're gonna be fine.

126
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:07,100
They're fighting
in front of you?

127
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,760
They don't think
they're fighting in front of me

128
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:10,600
'cause sometimes when
i wear the headphones,

129
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:11,590
I turn the music off.

130
00:05:12,670 --> 00:05:14,610
And you figured that out
all by yourself?

131
00:05:14,670 --> 00:05:17,810
Hey, you may think i'm dumb,
but you overestimate me.

132
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:22,250
My mistake.

133
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:23,920
So what are they arguing about?

134
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:25,720
Well, she doesn't
like his parents,

135
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:27,920
He doesn't like her spending,
and something about sex.

136
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:29,340
What about sex?

137
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,560
That's when i turn the music
back on, you sick freak.

138
00:05:37,890 --> 00:05:38,950
Sorry.

139
00:05:39,030 --> 00:05:40,900
I mean, that's my mother.

140
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,720
I said i'm sorry.

141
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,440
Man, i'm not gonna make it
three months.

142
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:50,510
Oh, great, now he's got
the moral high ground.

143
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:53,210
Forget about that.

144
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:54,700
The important thing is,

145
00:05:54,770 --> 00:05:58,810
Judith and herb are having
marital problems.

146
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,850
Why does that make you happy?

147
00:06:00,910 --> 00:06:02,680
Well, it's not happiness
exactly.

148
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:03,920
It's just that, you know,

149
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:05,350
All these years
she's been blaming me

150
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:09,030
For the failure of our marriage,
and now...

151
00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:13,000
Yeah, i guess happiness
pretty much sums it up.

♪ Men.

153
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:18,270

Oh, it's just for a few weeks.

I'm sure
if we all pull together,

157
00:06:25,810 --> 00:06:27,250
You'll hardly even notice
he's here.

158
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:29,410
Yeah, pull this.

159
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:32,250

160
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:35,110
You and me gotta
have a conversation.

Hey, alan.
Oh, hey, herb.

164
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:46,790
Judith asked me to drop
this stuff off for jake.

165
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:48,000
Oh, let me help you.

166
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:49,660
Thanks.

167
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:54,760
So, what have you two lovebirds
got planned

168
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:55,900
For the next few months?

169
00:06:55,970 --> 00:06:57,310
Second honeymoon?

170
00:06:57,370 --> 00:06:58,970
No, not exactly.

171
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:03,180
Hard to believe you're coming up
on your second anniversary.

172
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,210
Yep. Hard to believe.

173
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:06,480
Two years.

174
00:07:07,710 --> 00:07:10,080
Time flies
when you're having fun, eh?

175
00:07:10,150 --> 00:07:12,260
I wouldn't know.

176
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:14,280
Hey, herb.

177
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:15,850
Hey, charlie.

178
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:19,190
You ask him about his marriage
going down the crapper?

179
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:24,600
I was easing into it.

180
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:26,490

Is it in the bedroom?

183
00:07:29,370 --> 00:07:30,910

Is it sex?

No.
