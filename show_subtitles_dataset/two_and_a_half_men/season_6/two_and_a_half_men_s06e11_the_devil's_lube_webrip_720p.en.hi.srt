1
00:00:02,380 --> 00:00:03,050
Check it out.

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:05,090
They got cars that run
on vegetable oil now.

3
00:00:05,150 --> 00:00:05,880
How about that.

4
00:00:05,950 --> 00:00:07,280
You know what would be cool?

5
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:09,920
A Hummer that runs
on French fry grease.

6
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:10,820
Uh-huh.

7
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:12,420
We could be energy independent

8
00:00:12,490 --> 00:00:13,720
and still smash through crap.

9
00:00:13,790 --> 00:00:15,560
Sounds great.

10
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:18,700
Plus, the new car smell
is French fries.

11
00:00:18,770 --> 00:00:21,170
Okay, I'm only gonna
say this one more time.

12
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:23,070
You don't get your license
for two more years

13
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:24,610
and you're not
getting a Hummer.

14
00:00:24,670 --> 00:00:26,400
You know, you say you
want me to open up to you,

15
00:00:26,470 --> 00:00:27,940
but what's the point?

16
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:33,880
(chuckling)

17
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:36,490
Yeah, I always loved
Paris in the springtime.

18
00:00:36,550 --> 00:00:37,860
Oh, you're lucky.

19
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,790
I only got to do her
once, on Halloween.

20
00:00:41,690 --> 00:00:43,300
Hi.

21
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:44,800
Oh, hey, Alan.

22
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:45,960
Andy, this is
my brother Alan.

23
00:00:46,030 --> 00:00:47,500
Alan, Andy.
Hello.

24
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:48,560
Hey, Andy.

25
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:49,840
Pull up a chair.

26
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:51,070
We're just telling
war stories.

27
00:00:51,130 --> 00:00:52,060
Oh, great.

28
00:00:52,130 --> 00:00:53,130
The sponge?

29
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:54,900
Yeah.

30
00:00:54,970 --> 00:00:58,080
So, uh, how do you
guys know each other?

31
00:00:58,970 --> 00:01:00,600
Well, Andy and I—

32
00:01:00,670 --> 00:01:01,940
Can I have a cigar?

33
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:05,350
Sure, help yourself.

34
00:01:05,410 --> 00:01:07,940
Thank you.

35
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:09,860
Anyway, Andy and I
have known each other—

36
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:13,090
Maybe I'll take one for
now and one for later.

37
00:01:16,990 --> 00:01:20,090
Anyway, before
he moved to New York,

38
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:21,990
Andy and I were
partners in crime.

39
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:23,930
There weren't
that many actual crimes.

40
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,170
Unless you count
the ones against nature.

41
00:01:28,370 --> 00:01:29,840
Alan, this is a great man.

42
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:30,900
ANDY:
No, no,

43
00:01:30,970 --> 00:01:33,040
Albert Einstein
was a great man.

44
00:01:33,110 --> 00:01:34,850
I just drink, gamble and hump.

45
00:01:34,910 --> 00:01:36,210
But I'm great at it.

46
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:39,210
Andy once managed to hitchhike

47
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,390
from Vegas to L.A.,
wearing no pants.

48
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:45,290
Hey, anybody can
use their thumb.

49
00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:47,920
This right here,

50
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:50,000
this is the brother
I never had.

51
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:53,070
Oh, well,
how nice for you.

52
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:55,600
I don't mean it that way.

53
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:57,130
You're my brother.

54
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:57,940
Well, thank you.

55
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,570
I just like him better.

56
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:01,960
Got it.

57
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:04,040
*Andy is the one guy
in the world

58
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:06,330
that can match me drink for
drink and broad for broad.

59
00:02:06,410 --> 00:02:09,080
In fact, the one time I thought
I drank him under the table,

60
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:11,040
it turned out he had
a broad under there.

61
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:13,110
Right, Andy?

62
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:17,190
CHARLIE:
Andy?

63
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:20,350
Don't screw
with me, dude.

64
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:28,170

00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,040
in the chair, huh?

70
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:45,970
Yep.
(clicks tongue)

71
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:48,190
Remind me
to flip that cushion.

72
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:51,120
You should've seen it, Berta.

73
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:53,120
The paramedics zipped him up
in a big plastic bag.

74
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:54,190
Is that so?

75
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:55,720
It looked like
one of those things

76
00:02:55,790 --> 00:02:57,400
the delivery guys
use to keep pizza hot.

77
00:02:58,730 --> 00:03:00,600
I wonder if they
got him to the morgue

78
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:02,360
in 30 minutes or less.

79
00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:05,860
Not funny, Jake.

80
00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:08,700
Maybe it is funny and
you just didn't get it.

81
00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:10,440
Eat.

82
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:13,410
So, uh, did you know him?

83
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:15,470
Andy? Sure.

84
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:16,770
Before he moved to New York,

85
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,040
he and Charlie
were just like brothers.

86
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:20,510
Yeah, I heard that part.

87
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:21,540
How's Charlie taking it?

88
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:22,880
He's pretty shook up.

89
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:25,680
Well, you can understand why.

90
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:27,680
Somebody your age,
living the same

91
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:29,550
dumbass lifestyle you live

92
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:32,390
keels over and dies.

93
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:33,570
It's gotta give you pause.

94
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:35,900
You're right about that.

95
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:36,990
Actually, I'm surprised

96
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:38,730
that Charlie didn't go first.

97
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,010
Excuse me.

98
00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:43,040
I'm standing right here.

99
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:45,900
But for how long?

100
00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:49,380
Did you get that one?

101
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:53,040
I'll see you later.
Where you going?

102
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:54,840
Where do you think?
My best friend just died.

103
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:56,920
I got a lot of things
to take care of.

104
00:03:56,980 --> 00:03:58,580
You're handling
the funeral?

105
00:03:58,650 --> 00:03:59,680
I'm sure Andy
would like that.

106
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:00,680
The hell with Andy.

107
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:02,220
I'm going to the hospital

108
00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:04,200
to get every damn
medical test known to man.

109
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:06,130
Good one.

about your mortality,

you realize how much you care
about the people around you.

127
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:58,780
Yeah, and I need to
start showing it.

128

Well, little gifts are always

a nice way to express
your feelings.

131
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:09,020
Could be as simple
as a cashmere robe

as a new car.

have to be new!

00:07:15,450 --> 00:07:18,090
Anyway, you're
probably wondering

185
00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:19,380
why I bought it for you.

186
00:07:19,450 --> 00:07:22,050
Well, I just
assumed you love me

187
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:24,590
and did it out of the
goodness of your heart.

188
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:28,200
I'm kidding.
Why, dear?

189
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:30,990
Okay, I deserve that.

190
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:33,030
But the truth is
I do love you

191
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:34,760
and despite our
many differences,

192
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:36,060
I'm glad you're my mother.

193
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:39,480
You didn't drive over
here drunk, did you?

194
00:07:41,610 --> 00:07:43,450
I'm not drunk.

195
00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:44,840
I just...

196
00:07:44,910 --> 00:07:48,580
I've been thinking a lot
about how fleeting life is,

197
00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:51,520
and that none of us really knows
how long we're gonna be here.

198
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:55,480
Did you find another
lump on your pee-pee?

199
00:07:57,390 --> 00:07:59,450
No, Mom, my pee-pee's fine.

200
00:07:59,530 --> 00:08:02,700
I don't know how "worn down
to a nub" can be fine,

201
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:04,360
but all right.

202
00:08:05,470 --> 00:08:07,710
My point is,

203
00:08:07,770 --> 00:08:09,610
I don't want to be
angry with you anymore.

204
00:08:09,670 --> 00:08:11,080
I want us to be friends.

205
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:14,710
I was always
your friend, Charlie.

206
00:08:14,770 --> 00:08:17,670
You were just too
self-involved to see it.

207
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:23,080
Okay, I got to go.

208
00:08:23,150 --> 00:08:24,650
Where you off to?

209
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:28,190
I have to pick out
a casket for a friend of mine.

210
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:30,060
Oh, I'm... I'm so sorry.

211
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:32,250
Yeah, well, what
are you gonna do.

212
00:08:32,330 --> 00:08:34,200
Don't cheap out.

213
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:36,320
It's one thing to
do it with a watch,

214
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:38,340
but a casket is forever.

Yeah...

219
00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:52,110
Who'd have thought smoking,
drinking and whoring

220
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:53,950
could kill you?

221
00:08:54,010 --> 00:08:57,950
You realize that could just
as easily be me in there.

222
00:08:58,020 --> 00:09:00,260
Yeah.

223
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:03,420
Don't even
think that.

224
00:09:03,490 --> 00:09:05,550
It is a nice
casket, though.

225
00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:07,170
Should be.

226
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:08,900
It cost me ten grand.

227
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,630
Ten grand? Wow.

228
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:13,440
What can I say?
I take care of
the people I love.

229
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:16,660
Could've taken care of me
with a freakin' robe.

230
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:21,310
Kind of a light turnout.

231
00:09:21,370 --> 00:09:23,810
You'd probably get more
people with an open bar.

232
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:26,020
Hey, make sure there's
an open bar at mine.

233
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,190
Oh, now I'm your
funeral planner?

234
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:28,750
Don't you want a friend

235
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:31,220
or someone you really
care about in charge of that?

00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,560
No, you do it.

00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:37,400
MINISTER:
Good afternoon and welcome.

238
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:39,660
(somberly):
We are here

239
00:09:39,730 --> 00:09:41,730
to celebrate the life

240
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:43,830
and mourn the passing

241
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:46,640
of Andrew Donald Patterson.

242
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:50,140
How do we measure
a man's life?

243
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:52,470
Geez, this guy's a load.

244
00:09:55,210 --> 00:09:58,020
Don't get a guy
like this for me.

245
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:01,250
I want someone with
a little bit ofgravitas.

246
00:10:01,310 --> 00:10:03,950
I'll see if James Earl
Jones is available.

247
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:06,260
That would be nice.

248
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,990
"... a time to die,

249
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:11,160
"a time to reap,

250
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:12,790

And so we say goodbye
to Charles Francis Harper.

255

Devoted son,

256
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:27,350
loving brother,
caring uncle.

257
00:10:27,410 --> 00:10:30,150
Bon vivant and world-class

258
00:10:30,210 --> 00:10:32,550

259
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:36,510
Nice turnout.

260
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:39,380
Yeah, man.
Standing room only.

261
00:10:39,450 --> 00:10:42,550
Goes to show you, give
the people what they want.

262
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:45,090
You mean the
open bar, right?

263
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:47,530
Sure.

264
00:10:49,430 --> 00:10:51,600
Thanks for coming,
by the way.

265
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:53,160
Well, you came to mine.

266
00:10:53,230 --> 00:10:55,130
Yeah, but you're dead.

267
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,700
Charlie, take a
look in the box.

268
00:10:57,770 --> 00:10:59,930
That's not
a tanning booth.

269
00:11:00,010 --> 00:11:02,110
Oh, yeah.

270
00:11:02,170 --> 00:11:06,340
So, listen, as long as you're
here— what's Heaven like?

271
00:11:06,410 --> 00:11:07,710
It's unbelievable.

272
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:09,110
It's paradise.

273
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:10,450
Like your house.

274
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:11,860
Before your brother
moved in.

275
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,430
Oh, that was good.

276
00:11:13,490 --> 00:11:15,830
You can drink all you want
and there's no hangover.

277
00:11:15,890 --> 00:11:17,360

00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:18,920
each one more beautiful

279
00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:20,290
and, Charlie, get this:

280
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:22,320
they believe everything
you tell 'em.

281
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:24,140

00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:30,160
Well, save me a good seat.

285
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:33,710
I wish I could, but that's
not where they sent me.

286
00:11:33,770 --> 00:11:34,800
Oh...

287
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:38,410
Then how do you know
what Heaven's like?

288
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:41,090
They make us look at
a video every day,

289
00:11:41,150 --> 00:11:43,820
while they're putting
lube on the pitchfork.

290
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:48,430
Well, at least
you get lube.

291
00:11:48,490 --> 00:11:50,760
Only on the little prong.

292
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:54,200
JAMES EARL JONES:
To be completely honest,

293
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:56,520
I didn't know Charlie Harper,

294
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:59,800
but any man who,
with his dying breath,

295
00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:04,410
would set aside $25,000
and a first-class air ticket,

296
00:12:04,470 --> 00:12:06,430
so I could deliver
his eulogy...

297
00:12:06,510 --> 00:12:09,310
is aces in my book!

298
00:12:10,110 --> 00:12:11,580
That being said, uh...

299
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:13,940
there are many people here today
who did know Charlie,

300
00:12:14,010 --> 00:12:16,210
and perhaps some of them
would like to stand up

301
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:17,510
and say a few words.

302
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:19,650
Ooh! Ooh!
I want to say something.

303
00:12:20,590 --> 00:12:22,960
Uh... Hello, everybody.

304
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:25,850
Hello, James Earl Jones.

305
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:30,760
Um... hey, bro.
Don't get up.

306
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:34,740
What can I say
about Charlie?

307
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:37,570
Uh, so many words
come to mind—

308
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:39,680
so few that you can say
in church.

309
00:12:40,710 --> 00:12:42,880
But we'll give it a shot.

310
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:46,910
Um... Charlie was
a man of love.

311
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:50,560
Um, he loved his friends;
he loved his family;

312
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:53,730
but, most of all,
he loved his penis...

313
00:12:55,050 --> 00:12:58,790
the only part of him that
ever had an actual job.

314
00:13:01,130 --> 00:13:02,600
Well, anyway...

315
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:05,790
this was a man so full of love

316
00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:07,970
that it practically
oozed out of him,

317
00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:10,530
at which point, of course,
he would see a doctor.

318
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:18,780
But I kid the deceased
whoremonger.

319
00:13:18,850 --> 00:13:20,350
(chuckling)

320
00:13:20,410 --> 00:13:21,480
Anyway...

321
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:23,560
since he never
made out a will,

322
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:25,960
I hope you will all join me

323
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:30,500
for a wake-slash-luau
at my Malibu beach house!

324
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:33,060
(applause)

325
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:36,620
He got my house?

326
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:38,000
He got everything
you had.

327
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:38,930
Everything?

328
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,170
Well, not the
diseased liver

329
00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:42,860
and the swollen prostate.

330
00:13:44,370 --> 00:13:46,600
Oh, look, your
old girlfriends

331
00:13:46,670 --> 00:13:48,170
are saying their
final goodbye.

332
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:50,000

334
00:13:54,810 --> 00:13:56,740
That's not very
respectful.

335
00:13:56,820 --> 00:14:01,660
Just FYI— spit is
the Devil's lube.

336
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:07,420
Listen, would you mind
recording my answering
machine message for me?

337
00:14:07,490 --> 00:14:09,620
That'll be an extra $500.

338
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:11,700
That's okay.
I'm rich now.

339
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:14,200
Well, what do you want:
"This is CNN"

340
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:16,110
or "Luke, I am
your father"?

341
00:14:16,170 --> 00:14:19,340
So, Charlie, it's been
great catching up
but I gotta go.

342
00:14:19,410 --> 00:14:22,310
Already?
Can't you stay awhile?

343
00:14:22,370 --> 00:14:24,810
No. It's pitchfork time.

344
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:27,020
If you're late,
you don't get the spit.

345
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:31,580
And, believe me, Charlie,
you want the spit.

346
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:34,060

you took my blood

00:15:17,130 --> 00:15:18,640
Sure.

362
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:21,970
(monotone):
I don't want to go on
living without you.

363
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:24,770
What's the point
of it all?

364
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:29,310
Yeah, I'm rich, charming,
classically handsome.

365
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:31,780
I've laid more pipe than a guy

366
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:34,110
who has sex with pipes.

367
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:38,550
But what have I done
with my life?

368
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:41,760
A few stupid jingles;
some kids' songs—

369
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:43,550
nothing that really matters.

370
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:47,720
(monotone):
Now, now, you're being
too hard on yourself.

371
00:15:47,790 --> 00:15:50,930
I've got no wife,
I've got no children...

372
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,270
I'm going leave this world
the way I came in...

373
00:15:53,330 --> 00:15:56,160
By Cesarean section?

374
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:57,910
Alone.

375
00:15:57,970 --> 00:15:59,930
Oh, for God sakes,
Charlie,

376
00:16:00,010 --> 00:16:02,880
I am tired of
listening to this.

377
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:05,310
There has always been
one person in your life

378
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:08,220
who's been there for you and
loved you unconditionally.

379
00:16:11,050 --> 00:16:11,980
You mean...?

380
00:16:15,050 --> 00:16:17,450
You're right.

381
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:19,020
How could I
have missed it?

382
00:16:19,090 --> 00:16:21,560
It's been in front
of me the whole time!

383
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:22,670
Well, you know,
sometimes you can't see

384
00:16:22,730 --> 00:16:24,000
the forest for the trees,

385
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:26,260
even when the forest
is in your own backyard.

386
00:16:26,330 --> 00:16:28,160
Or guest room.

387
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,730
Rose?

388
00:16:33,270 --> 00:16:35,540
Yep, the one and only.

389
00:16:35,610 --> 00:16:37,920
I know, I know.
It's been awhile.

390
00:16:39,050 --> 00:16:41,050
I was thinking,
if you're not too busy,

391
00:16:41,110 --> 00:16:43,880
maybe we can get together,
have a drink or something?

392
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:46,010
Well, great!

393
00:16:46,090 --> 00:16:49,060
So, do you want to meet,
or should I pick you up?

394
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:50,920
(horn beeping)

395
00:16:54,190 --> 00:16:55,960
(mouthing)

396
00:16:56,030 --> 00:16:59,140
Okay, I'll meet you
back at my place.

397
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:04,730
Huh. Small world.

398
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:07,970
Yeah. Teeny-tiny.

401
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:16,240
Thank you, Charlie.

402
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:17,250
You comfy?

403
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:18,460
Oh, very.

404
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:19,790
Good.

405
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:23,350
(sighs)

406
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:25,320
So, Rose...

407
00:17:25,390 --> 00:17:27,520
Charlie...

408
00:17:27,590 --> 00:17:29,290
Haven't seen you
in awhile.

409
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:32,130
Can't say the same.

410
00:17:34,130 --> 00:17:35,830
Right, uh, sure.

411
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:37,300
Sorry about your friend.

412
00:17:37,370 --> 00:17:41,450
Yeah, yeah, it was a
real wake-up call for me.

413
00:17:41,510 --> 00:17:43,150
Mm. I can imagine.

414
00:17:43,210 --> 00:17:47,950
Makes you stop and wonder
what's important in your life.

415
00:17:48,010 --> 00:17:50,210
Who's important
in your life.

416
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:53,210
I've always known
who's important in my life.

417
00:17:53,290 --> 00:17:54,930
You have, haven't you.

418
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:59,720
You know how I feel
about you, right?

419
00:18:00,630 --> 00:18:02,030
Tell me anyway.

420
00:18:03,330 --> 00:18:05,770
Oh, okay.

421
00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:09,060
Well, as you know, we've
had our ups and downs.

422
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:12,080
I told you that was
my medication.

423
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:15,210
I was talking about
our relationship.

424
00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:17,040
Oh. Yes.

425
00:18:17,110 --> 00:18:18,350
That's had
ups and downs, too.

426
00:18:18,410 --> 00:18:20,070
Continue.

427
00:18:20,150 --> 00:18:24,090
Well, uh, I'm thinking,
we're not getting any younger.

428
00:18:24,150 --> 00:18:25,810
You know, there was a time

429
00:18:25,890 --> 00:18:27,320
when I did think
I was getting younger

430
00:18:27,390 --> 00:18:30,230
but it turns out that
that was my medication.

431
00:18:30,290 --> 00:18:31,430
Sure.

432
00:18:31,490 --> 00:18:34,690
I also thought
that I was getting smaller.

433
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:38,830
(clears throat)

434
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:43,370
Anyway, uh, it struck me
that life is... short,

435
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:46,480
and maybe the time has come
for you and I to start

436
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:47,850
thinking about
our future.

437
00:18:47,910 --> 00:18:49,950
What about it?

438
00:18:50,010 --> 00:18:53,020
(sighs heavily)
Well...

439
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:56,850
I know this is kind
of sudden, but...

440
00:19:03,690 --> 00:19:05,530
Rose...

441
00:19:05,590 --> 00:19:07,090
Yes, Charlie?

442
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:11,370
(phone rings)
Would you do me
the honor of...

443
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:14,670
I'm sorry.

444
00:19:14,730 --> 00:19:16,430
Let me just
get rid of this.

445
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:18,830
Oh, it's my doctor.

446
00:19:21,310 --> 00:19:22,280
Hey, Doc.

447
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:23,340
What's the word?

448
00:19:24,710 --> 00:19:26,110
No liver damage
whatsoever?

449
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:31,020
What about my heart?

450
00:19:32,550 --> 00:19:34,620
Well, that's terrific!

451
00:19:34,690 --> 00:19:37,330
Lungs are good, too?

452
00:19:37,390 --> 00:19:40,300
So I don't have to
give up cigars?

453
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:42,500
No, no, no,
I won't overdo it.

454
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:43,960
Just when I drink.

455
00:19:45,230 --> 00:19:49,230
Speaking of which—
how's the plumbing?

456
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:51,330
Does that include
the prostate?

457
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:53,470
(quietly):
Yes.

458
00:19:55,410 --> 00:19:56,850
All right, well, uh,

459
00:19:56,910 --> 00:19:58,450
thanks for getting
back to me so soon.

460
00:19:58,510 --> 00:20:01,880
And, again, I'm sorry
for all the name calling

461
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:04,460
when you slipped
your finger up there.

462
00:20:14,530 --> 00:20:16,370

Nah, it's just gonna

469
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:41,430
I have Mexican food
and a couple of beers

470
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:43,430
and I'm farting blood.

471
00:20:44,990 --> 00:20:47,490
Yeah, boo-hoo.

If it were,
you'd be cleaning my toilets

475
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:58,130
and I'd have
my own talk show.
