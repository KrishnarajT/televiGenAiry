1
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:04,970
all this time
without a jockstrap.

2
00:00:05,010 --> 00:00:05,910
I don't like it.

3
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:08,270
It feels like I'm flossing
my butt crack.

4
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:09,750
Based on what I'm paying
your dentist,

5
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:12,390
you know nothing about flossing.

6
00:00:12,410 --> 00:00:15,110
Think of it as
a bra for your balls.

7
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:18,790
Oh, now I want one.

8
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:20,050
What size are you?

9
00:00:20,090 --> 00:00:21,830
How should I know?

10
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:23,430
I think they have one
of those measuring things.

11
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:26,200
You know, like at
the shoe store.

12
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:27,130
Length, width.

13
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:28,890
He's kidding, right?

14
00:00:28,930 --> 00:00:30,460
Yes, he's joking,

15
00:00:31,570 --> 00:00:34,270
Don't do that.

16
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:36,130
Here, "teen."

17
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:38,430
Think you can fit
your junk into that?

18
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:40,370
I'll make it fit.
Let's just go.

19
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:42,880
No, no, put it on
over your pants.
We'll take a look.

20
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:44,540
The heck you will.

21
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:46,190
Charlie, you're
embarrassing him.

22
00:00:46,210 --> 00:00:47,340
Of course I am.

23
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:48,480
That's why I came.

24
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:50,360
Oh, sorry, sorry.
Excuse me.

25
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:51,820
Charlie Harper?

26
00:00:51,850 --> 00:00:54,920
Where? He owes
me money.

27
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:55,860
Miss Pasternak?

28
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:59,320
Jake! Wow, look at you.

29
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:00,460
Look how much you've grown.

30
00:01:00,490 --> 00:01:01,930
I reached puberty.

31
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:04,930
Oh, right, Miss Pasternak,
fifth grade,

32
00:01:04,970 --> 00:01:07,010
Woodward Avenue
Elementary School.

33
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,840
Oh, yeah,
Miss Pasternak!

34
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:11,880
Oh, yeah,
Miss Pasternak.

35
00:01:13,310 --> 00:01:14,410
So, are you still
teaching?

36
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:15,440
No. No, I'm not.

37
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:17,020
How are you, Charlie?

38
00:01:17,050 --> 00:01:18,520
Good, good. Nice to
see you. Long time.

39
00:01:18,550 --> 00:01:20,120
You look terrific.
Guess who's wearing a jock.

40
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:22,090
Oh, how nice.

41
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:23,560
Well, it's great to see you all.

42
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:25,280
Good-bye.

43
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:26,430
Bye, Miss Pasternak.

44
00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:28,920
Dodged a bullet there.

45
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:30,460
I'll say.

46
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:32,960
She was kind of shook up
after I broke it off with her.

47
00:01:32,990 --> 00:01:34,160
Kind of shook up?

48
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:36,140
She went bananas
and bit the gym teacher.

49
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:37,390
Where?

50
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:39,460
In the gym.

51
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:41,870
You miserable
son of a bitch!

52
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:43,930
I gave you my heart,
I gave you my soul,

53
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:46,370
I gave you my body and
you just threw me aside

54
00:01:46,410 --> 00:01:48,250
like I was some
piece of garbage!

55
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:50,480
Yeah, my bad.

56
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:52,320
So, what's new?

57
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:53,420
Oh, you want to catch up?

58
00:01:53,450 --> 00:01:55,050
Yeah, sure, let's catch up.

59
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:57,480
Let's see, um, well, okay,
after you dumped me,

60
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:59,260
I had a nervous breakdown.

61
00:01:59,290 --> 00:02:02,360
Well, it sure looks
like you bounced back.

62
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:04,550
And then after my breakdown,

63
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:07,060
I got fired and blackballed
from teaching.

64
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:09,300
Oh... bummer.

65
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:10,960
So, what are you up to now?

66
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,870
I'll tell you what
I'm up to now.

67
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:15,030
I lost my house, I'm
living in a cheap motel,

68
00:02:15,070 --> 00:02:17,580
and my new career is giving
lap dances to strangers

69
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:20,980
while I'm swinging by my crotch
on a pole eight times a night.

70
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:24,450
Have you considered
an athletic supporter?

71
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:28,610
Okay, well,
thanks for the update.

72
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:29,890
Nice seeing you.

73
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,090
(hushed):
Move, move, move.

74
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,130
You ruined my life,
Charlie Harper!

75
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:34,080
Righto. Bye.

76
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,650
We didn't pay for
the jockstrap.
Just keep walking.

77
00:02:35,690 --> 00:02:39,300
How can you live with yourself,
you horrible evil man?

78
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:40,900
He drinks.

85
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:13,200
We're making an apple
and sugar mixture...

86
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:14,430
What are you watching?

87
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:15,320
The Food Network.

88
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,530
I'm learning how

89
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,160
to prepare a
cinnamon-apple cobbler.

90
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:22,210
Tired of being at the mercy
of the dealers, huh?

91
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,680
What?

92
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:25,230
Nothing, nothing.

93
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:28,070
Listen, I think
I owe you an apology.

94
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:29,320
For what?

95
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:31,440
You know, this morning
in the drugstore?

96
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:33,290
Oh, yeah, the jockstrap jokes.

97
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:35,040
You shou be sorry.

98
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:37,150
No, not the jockstrap jokes.

99
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:40,260
Those were funny.
I stand by those.

100
00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:43,200
I meant the run-in
with your old teacher.

101
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:45,490
You probably shouldn't
have seen that.

102
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:47,000
I've seen worse.

103
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:48,400
Remember the Pilates
instructor who threw

104
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:51,170
the lit road flare
through your bedroom window?

105
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,710
Yeah.
That was awesome.

106
00:03:53,730 --> 00:03:56,030
That's one word
for it.

107
00:03:56,070 --> 00:03:58,000
Oh, and remember
the dental hygienist

108
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:00,110
who shot your ass up
full of Novocain?

109
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:01,240
I do.

110
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,450
That was so funny.

111
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:05,420
You kept falling off the toilet.

112
00:04:05,450 --> 00:04:09,020
Yeah, good times.

113
00:04:09,050 --> 00:04:12,250
What do you do
that gets these women
so pissed off at you?

114
00:04:12,290 --> 00:04:14,530
It's hard to say exactly.

115
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,760
I guess when a guy
has an intimate relationship...

116
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:18,420
Oh, remember the girl
from the tanning salon

117
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:20,770
who tried to shoot you
with a bow and arrow?

118
00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:23,230
Yeah, Jake.

119
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:27,560
My point is, I was wrong in
the way I treated those women,

120
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,570
and you should learn a lesson
from my mistakes.

121
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,370
You mean like keep
a fire extinguisher by your bed?

122
00:04:32,410 --> 00:04:35,010
Sure, that's one lesson.

123
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,570
And whenever a dental hygienist
drops a quarter,

124
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:38,540
never bend over to pick it up?

125
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:40,550
Yeah, that, too.

126
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:42,210
And never go
to a Halloween party

127
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:43,610
with a girl dressed
as Robin Hood?

128
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:45,750
The thing is, Jake,

129
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:47,790
you wouldn't have to learn
any of these lessons

130
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:50,520
if you always treated women
better in the first place.

131
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,770
I'm confused.
If I don't have to learn them,

132
00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:54,990
why are you bothering me
with them?

133
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:01,510
I don't know.

134
00:05:05,570 --> 00:05:09,710
I'm sorry to take up
your valuable time.

135
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:13,010
What the heck
was that all about?

136
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:18,060
♪ Men. ♪

137
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:22,690
Hey. Guess what?

138
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:27,490
Turns out my kid's
jockstrap is too small.

139
00:05:27,530 --> 00:05:30,070
Good news, eh?

140
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:32,370
Yeah, terrific.

141
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,800
Alan, let me
ask you something.

142
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:36,500
Do you think I'm a horrible,
evil person?

143
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:38,280
Yes.

144
00:05:39,710 --> 00:05:40,510
What? You are.

145
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:42,140
Thanks a lot.

146
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:44,580
Well, you know, not
intentionally evil.

147
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:46,110
I mean, you know,

148
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:49,090
is a tornado evil
when it picks up a mobile home

149
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,660
and flings it
into an orphanage?

150
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:52,620
Is a shark evil

151
00:05:52,650 --> 00:05:55,620
when it eats some poor
schmuck on a boogie board?

152
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:58,860
Is a flesh-eating virus evil
when it attacks...?

153
00:05:58,890 --> 00:06:00,420
I get it, I get it, I get it.

154
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:02,160
I'm a malevolent force
of nature.

155
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,600
Pretty much.

156
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:07,860
Is this about what happened
with Jake's old teacher today?

157
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:11,100
She said that I ruined her life.

158
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:13,750
Well, she did choose
to sleep with you.

159
00:06:13,770 --> 00:06:16,770
How much of a life
could she have had
in the first place?

160
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:19,180
Don't try
to make me feel better.

161
00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:23,320
Because of me, the woman
lost her teaching career,

162
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:26,350
and now she's dancing
in this skeevy club in Van Nuys

163
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:28,130
and living
in some fleabag motel.

164
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,460
How do you know
what club she works at?

165
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:33,490
The clubs have Web sites,
the Web sites have pictures.

166
00:06:33,530 --> 00:06:36,240
It's not rocket science.

167
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:39,730
Her dancing name
is Desiree Bush.

168
00:06:39,770 --> 00:06:43,910
Certainly more colorful
than Delores Pasternak.

169
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:46,280
And presidential to boot.

170
00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:49,620
I gotta tell you,
I'm feeling a little guilty.

171
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:51,410
Does that surprise you?

172
00:06:51,450 --> 00:06:54,790
No, what surprises me
is the liquor isn't helping.

173
00:06:54,820 --> 00:07:00,290
It just beads up on the guilt
and rolls right off it.

174
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:03,220
Oh, come on,
this can't be the first woman

175
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:04,530
who had a nervous breakdown,

176
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:07,200
lost her job and wound up
taking her clothes off

177
00:07:07,230 --> 00:07:09,240
for horny strangers

Well, maybe
you're finally

181
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:21,940

your actions have consequences

X being the number of dances
you can do in an hour.

00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:45,090
There'll be plenty of
time to pee in Heaven.

356
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,160
There's peeing in Heaven?

357
00:14:47,190 --> 00:14:48,730
Shh!

358
00:14:52,130 --> 00:14:55,900
Weird, us both being on our
knees at the same time, huh?

359
00:14:55,930 --> 00:14:57,840
Shh!

360
00:14:57,870 --> 00:14:59,840
I'm just saying.

00:15:06,970 --> 00:15:08,670
Morning.
How'd everybody sleep?

365
00:15:08,710 --> 00:15:09,750
Fine.
Fine.

366
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:11,880
Lousy.

367
00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:13,910
So, listen...

368
00:15:13,950 --> 00:15:16,760
we might have a little
problem with Miss Pasternak.

369
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:18,310
Oh, Charlie, you didn't.

370
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:21,250
No, I didn't. Why do you
always believe the worst of me?

371
00:15:21,290 --> 00:15:23,300
Because you're a horrible,
evil person.

372
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:25,920
I thought we established that.

373
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:27,970
I'll tell you
what happened.

374
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,070
Last night, I was upstairs,
sleeping alone,

375
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:31,270
minding my own business...

376
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:33,770
Good morning, sinners.

377
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:37,710
Oh, what a glorious day

378
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:39,980
to bask in the forgiveness
of our Lord.

379
00:15:41,070 --> 00:15:43,910
Uh-oh.

380
00:15:45,010 --> 00:15:48,780
Jake, I have wonderful news.

381
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:50,460
From now on,
as part of each lesson,

382
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,780
we're gonna spend time
casting demons out of you.

383
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:54,850
It's the Devil
that's making him stupid.

384
00:15:57,490 --> 00:16:00,160
I told you it
wasn't my fault.

385
00:16:00,190 --> 00:16:02,990
Uh, uh, Miss Pasternak,
while I'm thrilled

386
00:16:03,030 --> 00:16:04,990
that you're helping Jake
with his schoolwork,

387
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:07,360
I'm not sure an exorcism
is really called for.

388
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:10,130
Do you want your son
to go to hell, Alan?

389
00:16:10,170 --> 00:16:12,030
Depends.

390
00:16:12,070 --> 00:16:15,070
Do they have
a college prep program?

391
00:16:15,110 --> 00:16:18,120
Eternal damnation is
no laughing matter.

392
00:16:18,150 --> 00:16:20,290
I know—
I've been married twice.

393
00:16:20,310 --> 00:16:22,240
(laughs)

394
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:27,280
You think you have to wear
a jockstrap in hell?

395
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:29,750
Yes, but not your own.

396
00:16:29,790 --> 00:16:31,490
Anyway,

397
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:33,260
I just came down to tell you all

398
00:16:33,290 --> 00:16:34,790
it's time to get dressed
for church.

399
00:16:34,830 --> 00:16:36,840
Uh, uh, gee,

400
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:38,330
uh, thanks for the invite,

401
00:16:38,370 --> 00:16:40,810
but, uh, Sunday is
kind of our "me" day.

402
00:16:40,830 --> 00:16:44,170
Sunday's not a "me" day,
it's a "he" day.

403
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:47,770
And he will strike down the
blasphemers and the disbelievers

404
00:16:47,810 --> 00:16:50,380
with fury
and blood-soaked vengeance!

405
00:16:52,410 --> 00:16:56,110
So, chop-chop, washy-washy.

406
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:02,130
I've said it before,
and I'll say it again:

407
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,400

Oh, yeah, it's great.

after the service,

430
00:17:59,850 --> 00:18:00,920
you and I could
drive around

431
00:18:00,950 --> 00:18:03,560
and look for
a nice apartment for you.

He speaks through me.

437
00:18:19,070 --> 00:18:20,910

00:18:20,930 --> 00:18:24,530

It's time for the
special blessing.

442
00:18:30,010 --> 00:18:31,140
Come on, everyone,
let's go.

443
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:32,480
Right behind you.

444
00:18:32,510 --> 00:18:33,510
(organ playing)

445
00:18:33,550 --> 00:18:34,920

Blessing time,

447
00:18:36,150 --> 00:18:37,120
Come on.

448
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:40,230
Is this the kind of church

449
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:41,480
where they hand out
those little crackers?

450
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:42,450
Shh!
I'm hungry.

451
00:19:00,470 --> 00:19:01,900
Relax.

452
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:03,170
It's just us.

453
00:19:03,210 --> 00:19:05,440
Oh.

454
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:07,150
Why is your hair all wet?

455
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:08,980
They tried to drown me.

456
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:11,290
No, they didn't.

457
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:13,130
He managed
to get himself baptized.

458
00:19:13,150 --> 00:19:14,320
How'd that happen?

459
00:19:14,350 --> 00:19:15,350
People were lining up.

460
00:19:15,390 --> 00:19:17,330
I thought there was food.

461
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:18,900
Even after
they took your clothes

462
00:19:18,930 --> 00:19:20,400
and gave you
a white robe?

463
00:19:20,430 --> 00:19:23,000
I figured maybe
we were getting ribs.

464
00:19:25,070 --> 00:19:26,500
So where's Berta?

465
00:19:26,530 --> 00:19:28,530
She took a shine
to the organ player

466
00:19:28,570 --> 00:19:30,540
and stayed for
the senior potluck brunch.

467
00:19:30,570 --> 00:19:33,570
So there was food.

468
00:19:33,610 --> 00:19:35,450
I knew I wasn't crazy.

469
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:38,540
Aren't you at all
concerned about

470
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:39,520
what happened to Miss Pasternak?

471
00:19:39,550 --> 00:19:41,450
Of course I'm concerned.

472
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:43,450
I tried to hide, didn't I?

473
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:46,650
After she realized

474
00:19:46,690 --> 00:19:48,230
that you had dumped
her yet again,

475
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:49,590
she had a little
bit of a meltdown.

476
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:52,290
There was more to melt?

477
00:19:52,330 --> 00:19:55,470
She was dripping through the
cone when she left the house.

478
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:58,700
She grabbed all the bills
out of the collection plate

479
00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:00,560
and started grinding
on the minister.

480
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,630
Okay. No harm, no foul.

481
00:20:02,670 --> 00:20:04,510
How do you figure?

482
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:06,510
That's how
we found her, right?

483
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:08,650
Dry-humping
for dollars.

484
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:12,950
What happened to all your guilt
about ruining her life?

485
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:15,210
Oh, I still got it.

486
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:17,220
I'm just learning
to live with it.

487
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:19,250
You're unbelievable.

488
00:20:19,290 --> 00:20:20,690
Oh, come on.

489
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,350
I tried to do
the right thing.

490
00:20:22,390 --> 00:20:23,660
My intentions
were good.

491
00:20:23,690 --> 00:20:26,050
That's the funny thing
about you.

492
00:20:26,090 --> 00:20:28,960
Doesn't seem to matter
what your intentions are.

493
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,600
Good, bad or indifferent,

494
00:20:30,630 --> 00:20:33,500
everyone around you
ends up suffering.

495
00:20:33,530 --> 00:20:37,130
So it's not my
fault, right?

496
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:40,650
Right.

497
00:20:40,670 --> 00:20:42,170
Come on, I'll
buy you a drink.

498
00:20:42,210 --> 00:20:43,480
I'm really not in the mood.

499
00:20:43,510 --> 00:20:45,470
Oh, relax.

500
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:47,140
It's all over.

501
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:57,180
Nothing to
worry about.
