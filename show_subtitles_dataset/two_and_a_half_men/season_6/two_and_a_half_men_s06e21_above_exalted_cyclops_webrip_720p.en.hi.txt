00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,540
The minute I saw her, I
practically peed my pants.

185
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:19,500
Well then, I did follow
your lead.

186
00:07:19,570 --> 00:07:21,610
So-So what are we going
to do now?

187
00:07:21,670 --> 00:07:22,730
I don't know.

188
00:07:22,810 --> 00:07:23,910
I guess we play along.

189
00:07:23,970 --> 00:07:24,940
Play along?

190
00:07:25,010 --> 00:07:26,110
Are you serious?

191
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:27,150
What am I supposed
to do, Alan?

192
00:07:27,210 --> 00:07:28,370
Tell the truth?

193
00:07:28,450 --> 00:07:30,420
"Oh Chelsea, I
almost forgot,

194
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:32,380
"your new BFF and I had
a one-night stand

195
00:07:32,450 --> 00:07:34,560
"and when I dumped her,
she superglued my nutsack

196
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:36,720
"to my thigh and
started stalking me.

197
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:37,790
"Oh, and then

198
00:07:37,850 --> 00:07:39,420
"I thought maybe I was
in love with her

199
00:07:39,490 --> 00:07:40,800
"and followed her
to England.

200
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:42,560
"And then when she came
back from England,

201
00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:44,770
I thought I was dying and almost
asked her to marry me."

202
00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:47,400
Yeah, when you put it
in story form,

203
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:48,730
it really does sound bad.

204
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,240
So, we play along

205
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:53,270
until I can find out
what Rose's angle is.

206
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:55,310
So, what, I'm supposed
to date her?

207
00:07:55,370 --> 00:07:56,300
Stop flattering yourself.

208
00:07:56,370 --> 00:07:57,340
This isn't about you.

209
00:07:57,410 --> 00:07:58,810
It's me she's interested in.

210
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:00,520
What are you saying,
I'm not good enough for her?

211
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:02,280
What are you saying,

212
00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:03,790
you want that looney tune
as a girlfriend?

213
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:04,620
No!

214
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:06,810
But I am currently
unattached.

215
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:11,330
Now, you listen to me,

216
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:13,700
this is a blind date
that goes no further.

217
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:14,760
You understand?

218
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:16,220
I got it.

219
00:08:20,530 --> 00:08:22,660
(whispers):
She really likes him.

220
00:08:22,730 --> 00:08:23,860
Swell.

I'm sure they have some
meds in common.

224
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:50,120

your hopes up.

Why not?

226
00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:53,340
She's not his type.

What do you mean?

228
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:57,440
She's pretty,
smart, rich...

229
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:59,730
Okay, then, he's
not her type.

in the crib

for a poker tournament

around here.

00:09:59,530 --> 00:10:02,470
You want to catch me up?

248
00:10:02,530 --> 00:10:04,600
Chelsea set Alan up
on a blind date

249
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:06,640
with a girl she met
at yoga class.

250
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:08,430

She's the girl.

252
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:12,350
Oh.

253
00:10:12,410 --> 00:10:14,550
Diabolical.

254
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:17,750
So Chelsea doesn't know...

255
00:10:17,810 --> 00:10:20,650
Chelsea knows nothing and I want
to keep it that way.

256
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:21,960
Okay.

257
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:23,660
Why is Alan playing along?

258
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:25,780
Because Alan is a horny idiot.

259
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:29,100
And horny idiots are
perfectly willing

260
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:31,000
to have sex with crazy girls.

261
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:33,940
Yeah, I know. But I've grown.

262
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:37,870
Charlie, did you see?

263
00:10:37,930 --> 00:10:40,030
Yeah, I saw.

264
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:41,600
Told you they'd hit it off.

265
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:42,500
Didn't I tell you?

266
00:10:42,570 --> 00:10:44,000
You told me.

267
00:10:44,070 --> 00:10:47,340
I'm a little worried
they're moving so fast.

268
00:10:47,410 --> 00:10:50,310
Yeah, that's the worrisome part.

269
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:52,620
Berta, have you met Rose yet?

270
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,090

00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:11,570

00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:14,100
Changed?

290
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,530
She was stalking my fiancée.

291
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,640
Ah, ah, well, actually,
she explained all that.

292
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:19,030
Really?
Mm-hmm.

Uh, well, um...

295
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:23,580
Okay, I don't remember
all the details

296
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:25,470
'cause she was tweaking
my nipples at the time.

297
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:30,280
Oh... hi, Charlie.

298
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:34,020
All right, Rose,
what are you up to?

299
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:35,180
What do you mean?

300
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:37,350
I'm telling you right now,

301
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:40,160
I love Chelsea and if you
mess things up with us,

302
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:41,720
I will never forgive you.

303
00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:43,350
Wow.

304
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:45,770
What did I ever
do to deserve that?

305
00:12:47,730 --> 00:12:49,190
You're kidding, right?

306
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:50,570
Yeah.

307
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:56,370
So, once again,

308
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:58,410
what are you up to?

309
00:12:58,470 --> 00:13:01,240
Okay, at first,
I was just doing

310
00:13:01,310 --> 00:13:03,010
a little light
recon on Chelsea

311
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:05,350
to make sure you weren't
dating a whack job.

312
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:09,180
You thought
Chelsea might be...

313
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:10,920
Go on.

314
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:13,160
Well, good news,
she's not.

315
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:15,290
She's got a cousin who's
a truck stop hooker

316
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,930
and her mom's an honorary
Kleagle in the Ku Klux Klan,

317
00:13:17,990 --> 00:13:20,460
but Chelsea is clean
as a whistle.

318
00:13:20,530 --> 00:13:22,070
Kleagle?

319
00:13:22,130 --> 00:13:25,200
According to Wikipedia
it's below Grand Dragon

320
00:13:25,270 --> 00:13:28,280
and above Exalted Cyclops.

321
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:30,040
Sure, whatever.

322
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:33,250
What's the deal with
the lunch lady here?

323
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:39,410
Alan?

324
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:42,110
Well, that was Chelsea's
idea, not mine.

325
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:44,280
I tried to get
out of it.
Really?

326
00:13:44,350 --> 00:13:45,920
I'm sorry, sweetie,

327
00:13:45,990 --> 00:13:48,360
but I thought a double date
with Charlie and his fiancée

328
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:50,420
might be a little awkward.

329
00:13:50,490 --> 00:13:52,920
A little awkward?

330
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,570
When I saw you sitting there,

331
00:13:54,630 --> 00:13:55,990
my sphincter slammed
shut so quickly,

332
00:13:56,070 --> 00:13:58,340
you could've used it
as a cigar cutter!

333
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:03,640
Yeah, you should've
seen your face.

334
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:08,540
Anyway, it all worked
out for the best.

335
00:14:08,610 --> 00:14:10,410
Last night, I saw a
side of your brother

336
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,350
that I've never seen before.

337
00:14:12,410 --> 00:14:13,610
What side?

338
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,210
He's only got the two.

339
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:17,680
"Oh, no, here he comes"
and "Oh good, he's leaving."

340
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:21,150
Look, Charlie, this
has nothing to do

341
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:22,320
with you and Chelsea.

342
00:14:22,390 --> 00:14:24,020
This has nothing to
do with you and Rose.

343
00:14:24,090 --> 00:14:26,860
The fact is,
we really like each other

344
00:14:26,930 --> 00:14:29,740
and we want to keep
seeing each other.

345
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:32,910
And we'd really like
your blessing.

346
00:14:32,970 --> 00:14:35,510
So, you actually
want to be with him?

347
00:14:35,570 --> 00:14:37,030
I do.

348
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:40,450
And you believe she's got no
ulterior motive whatsoever?

349
00:14:40,510 --> 00:14:43,580
I do.

350
00:14:43,650 --> 00:14:45,620
Fine.

351
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:47,950
I now pronounce you
fruit basket and nutcase.

352
00:14:50,850 --> 00:14:53,550
May God have mercy
on your souls.

353
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:55,190
Yay!

354
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:58,400
Uh, I don't think that was
really a blessing, Rose.

355
00:14:58,460 --> 00:14:59,760
It doesn't matter.

356
00:14:59,830 --> 00:15:01,470
So what are we doing
this afternoon?

357
00:15:01,530 --> 00:15:03,230
Oh, uh, gee, I
gotta pick up Jake.

358
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:05,240
Um, I promised him
I'd take him to the movies.

359
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:06,530
You know, a little
father-son time.

360
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08,100
Oh, that's sweet.

361
00:15:08,170 --> 00:15:11,400
Well, just call me when you
want to get together again.

362
00:15:11,470 --> 00:15:13,100
Sure, or you can call me.

363
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:14,420
Okay.

364
