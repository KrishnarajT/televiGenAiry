Good morning.

3
00:00:07,295 --> 00:00:09,563
Top of the morning to you, sir.

4
00:00:09,565 --> 00:00:11,596
Oh, God.
Did you have a stroke?

5
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:14,045
Oh, no, no stroke.

6
00:00:14,047 --> 00:00:15,479
I'm bleaching my teeth.

7
00:00:15,481 --> 00:00:16,845
What?

8
00:00:17,878 --> 00:00:19,308
Sorry. I'm bleaching my teeth.

9
00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:21,402
Oh.

10
00:00:23,096 --> 00:00:24,360
And what are you up to?

11
00:00:24,362 --> 00:00:26,190
Nothing.
Just reading the news.

12
00:00:26,192 --> 00:00:29,019
Mmm. Me, too, old-school.

13
00:00:30,655 --> 00:00:32,790
Anything interesting
over there?

14
00:00:32,792 --> 00:00:34,760
Just reading an article
about how

15
00:00:34,762 --> 00:00:37,395
home teeth-whitening systems
might cause mouth cancer.

16
00:00:40,628 --> 00:00:43,496
Really?
No, of course not.

17
00:00:45,765 --> 00:00:47,531
Why are you even
bothering with that thing?

18
00:00:47,533 --> 00:00:51,125
Walden, I get rejected by women
for 100 different reasons.

19
00:00:51,127 --> 00:00:53,728
Whiter teeth would make it 99.

20
00:00:56,232 --> 00:00:57,731
Zoey?

21
00:00:57,733 --> 00:01:00,067
Oh. Hi, Ava.

22
00:01:00,069 --> 00:01:01,901
Good morning, Walden.

23
00:01:01,903 --> 00:01:04,970
What a great surprise.
What are you doing?

24
00:01:04,972 --> 00:01:07,706
I wanted to invite you
to my birthday party.

25
00:01:07,708 --> 00:01:10,509
That is so sweet.

26
00:01:11,512 --> 00:01:14,413
Uh, but I don't know if I can.

27
00:01:14,415 --> 00:01:15,782
Why not?

28
00:01:15,784 --> 00:01:17,184
Well...

29
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:19,354
Oh, boy.

30
00:01:19,356 --> 00:01:20,655
Uh, is your mom there?

31
00:01:20,657 --> 00:01:22,223
She's taking a shower.

32
00:01:22,225 --> 00:01:23,358
Maybe, when she gets out,

33
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,060
you could ask her
if I can come.

34
00:01:25,062 --> 00:01:27,763
Why? It's not her birthday.

35
00:01:27,765 --> 00:01:31,200
Oh, this is breaking my heart.

36
00:01:32,036 --> 00:01:33,570
Here's the thing, Ava.

37
00:01:33,572 --> 00:01:36,373
I'm not your mom's
boyfriend anymore.

38
00:01:36,375 --> 00:01:37,674
I know that.

39
00:01:37,676 --> 00:01:39,876
She's in the shower
with Peter.

40
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:47,015
Kids say the darnedest things.

41
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:52,588
Okay, I'll tell you what, Ava.

42
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:55,391
Uh, why don't you let me
talk to your mom

43
00:01:55,393 --> 00:01:57,460
and we'll figure
something out.

44
00:01:57,462 --> 00:01:59,428
Okay. I love you, Walden.

45
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:00,796
I love you, too.

46
00:02:00,798 --> 00:02:02,832
Good-bye.
Bye.

47
00:02:07,337 --> 00:02:09,338
Damn it.

48
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:12,875
I can't believe she's sleeping
with this guy already.

49
00:02:12,877 --> 00:02:14,577
Well, we don't know that.

50
00:02:14,579 --> 00:02:17,814
All we know is they're in
the shower together.

51
00:02:18,649 --> 00:02:20,316
You're not helping.

52
00:02:20,318 --> 00:02:21,851
Sorry.

53
00:02:21,853 --> 00:02:24,620
Hey, I know what
will cheer you up.

54
00:02:24,622 --> 00:02:26,622
A whiter smile.

55
00:02:27,591 --> 00:02:28,658
I've got another bleaching tray.

56
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:29,658
How about it?

57
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:30,726
No.

58
00:02:30,728 --> 00:02:31,827
You sure?

59
00:02:31,829 --> 00:02:33,061
You know what they say.

60
00:02:33,063 --> 00:02:37,098
A million-dollar smile
gathers a lot of interest.

61
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:39,334
Who says that?

62
00:02:39,336 --> 00:02:42,703
It's the slogan on the box.

63
00:02:42,705 --> 00:02:44,605
At least I think it is.

64
00:02:44,607 --> 00:02:46,774
My Spanish is a little shaky.

65
00:02:46,776 --> 00:02:48,676
I'll pass.

66
00:02:48,678 --> 00:02:50,010
You sure?

67
00:02:50,012 --> 00:02:51,612
Might get your mind off of Zoey.

68
00:02:51,614 --> 00:02:53,248
My mind is not on Zoey.

69
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:54,949
Okay, fine.

70
00:03:00,522 --> 00:03:02,623
You need to stop parking
your car in the garage.

71
00:03:02,625 --> 00:03:04,425
Really? How come?

72
00:03:04,427 --> 00:03:05,759
It's leaking oil.

73
00:03:05,761 --> 00:03:06,994
Oh, I don't think so.

74
00:03:06,996 --> 00:03:09,764
I haven't put oil in it
in two years.

75
00:03:09,766 --> 00:03:11,166
Well, it's leaking something.

76
00:03:11,168 --> 00:03:13,201
Well, why don't I just
put down some cardboard?

77
00:03:13,203 --> 00:03:14,536
Why don't you just
put it on the street?

78
00:03:14,538 --> 00:03:17,138
Oh, no, the salty sea air
is very corrosive.

79
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:18,974
It'll hurt the blue book value.

80
00:03:18,976 --> 00:03:22,144
Alan, you drive a 13-year-old
Volvo station wagon

81
00:03:22,146 --> 00:03:24,646
with a quarter of a million
miles on it.

82
00:03:24,648 --> 00:03:27,149
The blue book
has more value than your car.

83
00:03:28,018 --> 00:03:29,852
Well, okay, but I-I...

84
00:03:29,854 --> 00:03:31,653
No buts.

85
00:03:31,655 --> 00:03:32,855
You put your car on the street

86
00:03:32,857 --> 00:03:34,623
or I'll put your ass
on the street.

87
00:03:39,729 --> 00:03:41,396
What a colossal douche.

88
00:03:41,398 --> 00:03:42,664

for going off on you

pigeons nest under there.

I'll get it washed for you.

112
00:04:45,481 --> 00:04:47,281
It'll need detailing.

113
00:04:47,283 --> 00:04:48,883

Yeah, they look

Oh, thank you. Thank you.

Hey, I'm really sorry
about the whole car thing.

127

This breakup's got me

Oh, I understand.

129
00:05:28,693 --> 00:05:31,026
When my wife left me,
I had a lot of anger.

130
00:05:31,028 --> 00:05:32,328
Of course, I internalized it,

131
00:05:32,330 --> 00:05:34,630
which led to a lot
of hair in the sink

132
00:05:34,632 --> 00:05:36,466
and blood in the toilet.

133
00:05:36,468 --> 00:05:39,669
So you know what it's like
to love someone so much

134
00:05:39,671 --> 00:05:41,837
that your heart feels
like it's going to explode

135
00:05:41,839 --> 00:05:43,906
from your chest
with pure happiness.

136
00:05:43,908 --> 00:05:46,342
Oh, God, no. I was just pissed
off about losing the house.

137
00:05:47,311 --> 00:05:48,878
My point is that...

138
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,279
that everybody has problems,

139
00:05:50,281 --> 00:05:52,915
but what's important
is how you deal with them.

140
00:05:52,917 --> 00:05:54,850
Here, let me
get that for you.

141
00:05:54,852 --> 00:05:56,585
See, the key is,

142
00:05:56,587 --> 00:05:58,754
you got to tap it
in the right spot.

143
00:06:00,056 --> 00:06:02,224
It's not...
Oh.

144
00:06:02,226 --> 00:06:03,860
It's okay. I-I got it.
No, no.

145
00:06:03,862 --> 00:06:05,929
I can get it.

146
00:06:05,931 --> 00:06:07,930
What the hell?

147
00:06:09,333 --> 00:06:10,900
Son of a bitch!

148
00:06:10,902 --> 00:06:12,334
It's fine.
Don't worry about it.

149
00:06:12,336 --> 00:06:13,502
No, it's not.

150
00:06:13,504 --> 00:06:15,270
I want ketchup,
and I can't have it.

151
00:06:15,272 --> 00:06:16,772
Calm down.
It's just a condiment.

152
00:06:16,774 --> 00:06:18,207
Choose me, damn it!

153
00:06:18,209 --> 00:06:19,808
Choose me!

154
00:06:19,810 --> 00:06:22,010
Okay, we're-we're not talking
about ketchup anymore, are we?

155
00:06:22,012 --> 00:06:23,245
What else would we...

156
00:06:23,247 --> 00:06:25,848
be talking about?

157
00:06:27,083 --> 00:06:28,951
Okay.

158
00:06:28,953 --> 00:06:31,453
Uh, here, let me
help you clean that up.

159
00:06:31,455 --> 00:06:33,188
Oh, no, no,
don't worry about it.

160
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:34,123
You know what? Here.

161
00:06:34,125 --> 00:06:35,357
Give me your...
your shirt and pants,

162
00:06:35,359 --> 00:06:36,525
and I'll throw them
in the washer.

163
00:06:36,527 --> 00:06:37,693
Oh, that's not necessary,
actually.

164
00:06:37,695 --> 00:06:39,796
Give me your shirt and pants!

165
00:06:39,798 --> 00:06:41,297
Okay. Okay.

166
00:06:41,299 --> 00:06:44,367
Oh, uh, don't wash the
shirt with the pants,

167
00:06:44,369 --> 00:06:47,070
'cause it's off brand
and the colors tend to run.

168
00:06:47,072 --> 00:06:49,272
Oh, and, uh... and wash
the pants in cold water.

169
00:06:49,274 --> 00:06:51,508
Okay.
They shrink in warm water.

170
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:53,543
Of course, that's funny
because, uh,

171
00:06:53,545 --> 00:06:54,811
I shrink in cold water.

172
00:06:54,813 --> 00:06:56,446
Just give me
your stupid clothes!

173
00:06:56,448 --> 00:06:57,881
Hey, here, here.

174
00:06:57,883 --> 00:07:00,016
Thank you.

175
00:07:02,786 --> 00:07:05,855
I am so back in the garage.

176
00:07:09,094 --> 00:07:11,094

180
00:07:18,736 --> 00:07:22,705

a door-to-door ketchup salesman.

Oh, Robin.

182
00:07:30,647 --> 00:07:32,313
Hello, Alan.

183
00:07:32,315 --> 00:07:34,516
Sorry. Uh, come on in.

184
00:07:36,519 --> 00:07:37,953
Walden, your mom's here!

185
00:07:37,955 --> 00:07:40,489
Be right there!

186
00:07:40,491 --> 00:07:41,924
So, nice to see you.

187
00:07:41,926 --> 00:07:45,295
Well, it's nice to see...
so much of you.

188
00:07:45,297 --> 00:07:48,063
Your son insisted
I take off my clothes

189
00:07:48,065 --> 00:07:50,032
after he soiled them.

190
00:07:51,434 --> 00:07:53,335
That sounded weird, didn't it?

191
00:07:54,170 --> 00:07:55,671
So, uh...
so, what brings you by?

192
00:07:55,673 --> 00:07:57,306
Walden's taking me to lunch.

193
00:07:57,308 --> 00:07:58,374
Oh, lovely.

194
00:07:58,376 --> 00:08:00,509
I enjoy the occasional lunch
with my mom.

195
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:03,479
Really?
As one enjoys the occasional colonoscopy.

196
00:08:05,483 --> 00:08:07,483
Walden!

197
00:08:07,485 --> 00:08:09,185
Sorry.

198
00:08:09,187 --> 00:08:10,453
Let's go.

199
00:08:10,455 --> 00:08:11,787
I'll drive.
Okay.

200
00:08:11,789 --> 00:08:13,322
Oh, bon appétit.

201
00:08:13,324 --> 00:08:15,891
Bye.
Bye.

202
00:08:16,792 --> 00:08:19,294
Everything about that man
is disturbing.

203
00:08:21,464 --> 00:08:22,965
Nice to see you again.

204
00:08:22,967 --> 00:08:24,300
Oh, look.

205
00:08:24,302 --> 00:08:26,669
New yellow pages.

206
00:08:27,571 --> 00:08:29,905
Oh, man.

207
00:08:31,008 --> 00:08:32,842
Oh, boy.

208
00:08:32,844 --> 00:08:34,610
Uh, Berta!
Yeah?

209
00:08:34,612 --> 00:08:36,445
I'm locked out.

210
00:08:36,447 --> 00:08:38,080
Hang on.

211
00:08:38,082 --> 00:08:40,883
Hurry up! I don't have
any clothes on!

212
00:08:46,724 --> 00:08:48,691
Hello?

213
00:08:48,693 --> 00:08:50,159
Berta?

214
00:08:50,161 --> 00:08:52,895
Oh, come on!

215
00:08:54,765 --> 00:08:55,965
This is nice.

216
00:08:55,967 --> 00:08:57,199
You and I
haven't gone out

217
00:08:57,201 --> 00:08:59,068
for a bite to eat
in a long time.

218
00:08:59,070 --> 00:09:00,202
Yeah.

219
00:09:00,204 --> 00:09:02,204
It's a shame Zoey
couldn't join us.

220
00:09:02,206 --> 00:09:03,639
Mm-hmm.

221
00:09:03,641 --> 00:09:05,507
How's she doing?

222
00:09:06,342 --> 00:09:07,642
Fine.

223
00:09:07,644 --> 00:09:08,843
Good. I'm glad.

224
00:09:08,845 --> 00:09:10,044
She's a great gal.

225
00:09:10,046 --> 00:09:12,180
You don't want to let
that one get away.

226
00:09:13,315 --> 00:09:15,516
Right.

227
00:09:15,518 --> 00:09:17,752
How old is her daughter?
Eight?

228
00:09:17,754 --> 00:09:19,120
She's almost nine.

229
00:09:19,122 --> 00:09:20,588
When's her birthday?

230
00:09:20,590 --> 00:09:21,923
Few days.

231
00:09:21,925 --> 00:09:23,759
Oh, fun.
Is there going to be a party?

232
00:09:23,761 --> 00:09:25,727
Yeah.

233
00:09:25,729 --> 00:09:27,763
You know, for one
of your birthdays,

234
00:09:27,765 --> 00:09:29,431
I got you a bouncy castle.

235
00:09:29,433 --> 00:09:30,565
Do you remember?

236
00:09:30,567 --> 00:09:31,800
I do.

237
00:09:31,802 --> 00:09:34,235
You should get one of those
for Zoey's daughter.

238
00:09:34,237 --> 00:09:35,970
That's a good idea.

239
00:09:35,972 --> 00:09:38,039
Oh, and take
lots of pictures.

240
00:09:38,041 --> 00:09:41,476
Those are the moments
you remember forever.

241
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:45,247
What... what's happening?

242
00:09:45,249 --> 00:09:46,648
We're out of gas.

243
00:09:46,650 --> 00:09:48,950
We just passed a station.
I'll be right back.

244
00:09:51,755 --> 00:09:54,490
This is an electric car.

245
00:09:57,728 --> 00:09:59,762
Hey.

246
00:09:59,764 --> 00:10:00,897
Hey.

247
00:10:00,899 --> 00:10:01,931
Hey, wait...

248
00:10:01,933 --> 00:10:03,600
Aren't you having
lunch with your mom?

249
00:10:03,602 --> 00:10:05,935
I was, but then she insisted

250
00:10:05,937 --> 00:10:08,137
on taking an interest
in my life.

251
00:10:08,139 --> 00:10:10,106
That bitch.

252
00:10:10,108 --> 00:10:12,208
What are you working on?

253
00:10:12,210 --> 00:10:14,544
Oh, the, uh...
the NASDAQ presentation.

254
00:10:14,546 --> 00:10:15,945
I could use a hand.

255
00:10:15,947 --> 00:10:17,046
Sure. Send it over.

256
00:10:17,048 --> 00:10:18,848
Okay, here.
Here it comes.

257
00:10:20,618 --> 00:10:22,252
Oh, how'd
the marriage proposal go?

258
00:10:22,254 --> 00:10:23,720
Went fine.

259
00:10:23,722 --> 00:10:25,122
How big of a rock
did you give her?

260
00:10:25,124 --> 00:10:26,924
Pretty big.

261
00:10:26,926 --> 00:10:29,994
She go under the table
to thank you?

262
00:10:29,996 --> 00:10:32,295
No, but you can.

263
00:10:35,032 --> 00:10:36,800
Wow, Walden!

264
00:10:36,802 --> 00:10:38,968
Dude.

265
00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:40,336
When's the big day?

266
00:10:40,338 --> 00:10:41,437
Don't know.

267
00:10:41,439 --> 00:10:42,472
What do you mean,
you don't know?

268
00:10:42,474 --> 00:10:44,040
I mean we haven't
set a date yet!

269
00:10:44,042 --> 00:10:46,042
Whoa. Don't bite my head off,
man, okay?

270
00:10:46,044 --> 00:10:48,144
Just... wow.

271
00:10:51,715 --> 00:10:53,683
Oh, my God.
What?

272
00:10:53,685 --> 00:10:55,919
She shot you down, didn't she?

273
00:10:55,921 --> 00:10:58,221
Can we just focus
on the presentation?

274
00:10:58,223 --> 00:11:00,490
No, we can't! Listen, look,

275
00:11:00,492 --> 00:11:02,226
did she give you a reason?

276
00:11:02,228 --> 00:11:04,428
Billy, seriously, let it go.

277
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:06,397
Was it, was it, was it
that you were,

278
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:07,965
you were too pretty or too rich?

279
00:11:07,967 --> 00:11:11,302
Walden, Walden, this proves
that God exists,

280
00:11:11,304 --> 00:11:12,670
and he's a short fat guy

281
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:15,506
that didn't get laid
in high school.

282
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:17,909
Stop, please.

283
00:11:17,911 --> 00:11:19,644
Listen, listen, listen, okay,

284
00:11:19,646 --> 00:11:22,747
first Bridget divorces you,
and starts dating me.

285
00:11:22,749 --> 00:11:25,015
And I mean, like, right?

286
00:11:25,017 --> 00:11:28,018
Then, then you get dumped
by Mary Poppins.

287
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:30,387
I mean, Walden,
you've gotta wonder,

288
00:11:30,389 --> 00:11:33,423
what is it about you
that drives women away?

289
00:11:35,226 --> 00:11:37,293
Billy, this is your last chance,
dude.

290
00:11:37,295 --> 00:11:39,362
Okay, I'm changing the subject.

291
00:11:39,364 --> 00:11:41,664
Changing the
subject, okay?

292
00:11:41,666 --> 00:11:44,234

in the shower this morning.

Oh, I'm just checking in.

298
00:12:08,419 --> 00:12:10,451
You know, you've been hiding out
up here

299
00:12:10,453 --> 00:12:11,986
for quite a few days now.

300
00:12:11,988 --> 00:12:14,222
Yeah, I'm busy.

301
00:12:14,224 --> 00:12:17,325
I can, I can
see that.

302
00:12:17,327 --> 00:12:18,627
So, what do you
got here?

303
00:12:18,629 --> 00:12:22,397
Is this Versailles or
an Indian casino?

304
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:27,557
No, it's a dream house.

305
00:12:27,559 --> 00:12:29,158
if we would have gotten married.

306
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:31,661
Sure, that's not weird.

307
00:12:31,663 --> 00:12:35,364
Um... Oh, oh, uh, you
been smoking some pot?

308
00:12:35,366 --> 00:12:36,698
No.

309
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:39,166
What a shame.
Would've explained a lot.

310
00:12:39,168 --> 00:12:40,601
Um...

311
00:12:40,603 --> 00:12:43,304
listen, buddy, maybe it's
time to take a break.

312
00:12:43,306 --> 00:12:46,474
No, I gotta finish the roof
before the rainy season.

313
00:12:46,476 --> 00:12:52,113
Oh, there's weather
in Legoland? Um...

314
00:12:52,115 --> 00:12:54,915
Oh, by the way, I brought you
your own tooth-whitening kit.

You know, in case you ever feel
like smiling again.

316
00:12:58,087 --> 00:13:00,854
"As seen on Telemundo."

317
00:13:00,856 --> 00:13:02,889
Put it in the Zoey room.

318
00:13:02,891 --> 00:13:03,957
What?

319
00:13:03,959 --> 00:13:05,458
The Zoey room.

Oh, boy.

322
00:13:16,538 --> 00:13:20,207

the yellow police tape.

I know you're
all as concerned

327
00:13:33,757 --> 00:13:35,457
about Walden as I am.

328
00:13:35,459 --> 00:13:36,958
You know what I'm concerned
about?

329
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:40,462
I'm concerned with the tooth
he knocked out of my head,

I'd just like to point out,

336
00:13:55,446 --> 00:13:58,681
that Walden is not the first
rich and handsome guy

337
00:13:58,683 --> 00:14:01,451

maybe the house is haunted.

340
00:14:10,027 --> 00:14:12,828
Maybe it's plagued
by a negative entity

341
00:14:12,830 --> 00:14:14,430
who just won't leave.

342
00:14:14,432 --> 00:14:17,734
Hey, you're not gonna hang this
on me.

343
00:14:19,603 --> 00:14:22,405
It's my hope that if we
share our concerns with Walden

344
00:14:22,407 --> 00:14:23,606
with a unified voice,

345
00:14:23,608 --> 00:14:25,741
we might be able
to get through to him.

346
00:14:25,743 --> 00:14:27,376
Like an intervention?

347
00:14:27,378 --> 00:14:28,844
Oh, those suck.

348
00:14:28,846 --> 00:14:32,248

judgmental surprise parties.

349
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:35,718
They're, like, "Surprise,
you're a loser."

350
00:14:37,987 --> 00:14:39,788
I don't need an intervention.

351

This breakup hit me a lot harder
than I thought.

358
00:15:03,114 --> 00:15:05,715
Well, anyway,
I-I want to apologize

359
00:15:05,717 --> 00:15:08,819
for the way
that I've been acting.

360
00:15:08,821 --> 00:15:11,522

I had perfect teeth.

I... Yes, I was saying that
lately I've been really sad,

370
00:15:47,092 --> 00:15:50,360
and I didn't know how to deal
with it, so I got angry.

But I think now I know how to
process those feelings, so I...
