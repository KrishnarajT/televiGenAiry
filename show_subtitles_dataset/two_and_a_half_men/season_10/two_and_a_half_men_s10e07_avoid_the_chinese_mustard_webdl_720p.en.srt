1
00:00:02,863 --> 00:00:03,974
What are you
doing here?

2
00:00:03,975 --> 00:00:05,022
I got a weekend pass,

3
00:00:05,033 --> 00:00:07,069
so I took a train in
to surprise you guys.

4
00:00:07,103 --> 00:00:08,676
Hi, soldier.
Hello.

5
00:00:08,690 --> 00:00:09,979
You must be Jake.

6
00:00:10,003 --> 00:00:11,302
I'm sleeping in your room.

7
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:13,290
Well, God bless America.

8
00:00:13,308 --> 00:00:14,507
You are just so sweet.

9
00:00:14,528 --> 00:00:16,028
I swear, I could just
eat you up,

10
00:00:16,043 --> 00:00:18,527
but you know, then
I'd probably get a sugar rush.

11
00:00:18,956 --> 00:00:20,339
Missi still sleeping?

12
00:00:20,349 --> 00:00:22,672
Nah, she's in the shower.

13
00:00:25,302 --> 00:00:26,794
Oops.

14
00:00:27,106 --> 00:00:28,792
I get another pass
in, like, a month,

15
00:00:28,803 --> 00:00:30,375
so maybe we can
see each other then.

16
00:00:30,387 --> 00:00:32,142
I sort of have a boyfriend.

17
00:00:32,161 --> 00:00:33,106
A boyfriend?

18
00:00:33,122 --> 00:00:35,192
But I thought you...

19
00:00:36,275 --> 00:00:38,298
Good-bye, Jake.

20
00:00:38,584 --> 00:00:40,566
Don't be a hero.

21
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:45,623
What the hell just happened?

22
00:00:48,673 --> 00:00:49,604
Hey.

23
00:00:49,881 --> 00:00:51,038
Hey.

24
00:00:52,078 --> 00:00:54,346
Wait. I thought you had a date
with Lyndsey tonight.

25
00:00:54,355 --> 00:00:55,729
Oh, yeah, I was
supposed to,

26
00:00:55,742 --> 00:00:58,171
but, uh, we decided to
take a little break.

27
00:00:58,191 --> 00:00:59,417
How come?

28
00:00:59,431 --> 00:01:01,598
Oh, I'm not privy
to that information.

29
00:01:02,527 --> 00:01:05,378
Uh, all I was told is,
we need to take a break.

30
00:01:06,028 --> 00:01:08,261
So, what, you're supposed
to just wait around

31
00:01:08,271 --> 00:01:10,892
until she decides that you're worthy
of being in her presence again?

32
00:01:10,905 --> 00:01:13,572
Or until she needs her
rain gutters cleaned out.

33
00:01:13,821 --> 00:01:16,233
And-and that's
not a euphemism.

34
00:01:17,396 --> 00:01:19,034
See, this is the kind of crap

35
00:01:19,046 --> 00:01:21,347
you got to put up with
when you're in a relationship.

36
00:01:21,364 --> 00:01:24,365
Oh, but-but it's a small
price to pay for love,

37
00:01:24,388 --> 00:01:26,838
companionship and
a parking spot

38
00:01:26,854 --> 00:01:29,483
for the pink Prius.

39
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:33,929
It's hard to believe that
Lyndsey needed a break from you.

40
00:01:39,302 --> 00:01:41,343
Oh. Well, if you will excuse me,

41
00:01:41,359 --> 00:01:44,571
I have a date
with an extra large meat lover.

42
00:01:45,108 --> 00:01:47,183
That did not sound right.

43
00:01:48,133 --> 00:01:49,919
I ordered a pizza.

44
00:01:52,924 --> 00:01:54,202
Walden!

45
00:01:54,222 --> 00:01:55,855
Missi.

46
00:01:57,041 --> 00:01:58,797
I am so sorry

47
00:01:58,809 --> 00:02:00,346
to show up
unannounced, but

48
00:02:00,358 --> 00:02:02,157
me and my mom got
in this huge fight over

49
00:02:02,182 --> 00:02:03,850
whether or not I should pay rent
to stay at her house.

50
00:02:03,862 --> 00:02:05,478
And I said,
"Fine, but if I pay rent,

51
00:02:05,491 --> 00:02:06,798
then your stupid boyfriend
should, too."

52
00:02:06,807 --> 00:02:07,868
He said,
"Don't sass your mother."

53
00:02:07,877 --> 00:02:09,177
I said,
"Do not tell me what to do.

54
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:11,181
I am six months older than you"

55
00:02:11,371 --> 00:02:12,304
Anyway,

56
00:02:12,318 --> 00:02:14,692
you said I was welcome here
any time I want, so, ding-dong,

57
00:02:14,704 --> 00:02:16,154
here I am.
Uh...

58
00:02:16,367 --> 00:02:17,942
Alan, how are you?

59
00:02:17,965 --> 00:02:19,813
I'm good.
What brings you here?

60
00:02:19,824 --> 00:02:21,831
- Me and my...
- No! No!

61
00:02:23,414 --> 00:02:25,114
Hey.

62
00:02:25,267 --> 00:02:26,785
Jake, what
are you doing here?

63
00:02:26,803 --> 00:02:29,453
I got a weekend pass. Missi?

64
00:02:29,612 --> 00:02:31,495
What are you doing here?

65
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:35,165
Jake? What a surprise!

66
00:02:39,445 --> 00:02:41,750
- I'm suspicious.
- You think?

67
00:02:50,088 --> 00:02:53,370
== sync, corrected by elderman ==
Sync for WEB-DL by ryangiggsth

68
00:02:53,619 --> 00:02:55,750
I still can't get over
this coincidence.

69
00:02:55,774 --> 00:02:57,387
I mean, what are the odds?

70
00:02:57,406 --> 00:03:00,030
The same weekend I come home,
Missi just happens...

71
00:03:00,052 --> 00:03:01,698
Jake, let it go.

72
00:03:02,385 --> 00:03:03,293
Missi,

73
00:03:03,312 --> 00:03:05,595
help me out here.
I thought you guys broke up.

74
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:09,188
We did, but then Jake sent me
this giant cookie he baked

75
00:03:09,219 --> 00:03:11,663
that was shaped like a heart,
and it said, "I Missi you"

76
00:03:11,686 --> 00:03:13,618
and I just melted.

77
00:03:13,743 --> 00:03:15,985
Well, you know,
I can't take all the credit.

78
00:03:16,025 --> 00:03:18,026
The cookie was
loaded with pot.

79
00:03:18,467 --> 00:03:19,706
So, uh,

80
00:03:19,733 --> 00:03:22,665
Jake, you want to go to
your bedroom and unpack?

81
00:03:22,698 --> 00:03:25,081
Uh, that's okay.
I don't really have much.

82
00:03:25,643 --> 00:03:30,557
Well, then maybe you
can help me... unpack.

83
00:03:31,586 --> 00:03:32,852
Why?

84
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:34,042
Dude,

85
00:03:34,053 --> 00:03:37,074
she's not really talking
about unpacking.

86
00:03:37,803 --> 00:03:40,321
Oh. Oh, okay, yeah,

87
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:42,253
I could definitely go
for a good unpacking.

88
00:03:42,275 --> 00:03:43,840
Well, then, come on.

89
00:03:43,868 --> 00:03:46,868
Hey, um, maybe later we could go
for a walk on the beach.

90
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:48,753
Oh, yeah!

91
00:03:49,696 --> 00:03:53,032
She means an actual walk
on the beach!

92
00:03:54,803 --> 00:03:56,624
That's it.
I'm out of here.

93
00:03:56,635 --> 00:03:58,478
- Where you going?
- Someplace quiet.

94
00:03:58,503 --> 00:03:59,938
What are you talking about?
It's quiet here.

95
00:03:59,954 --> 00:04:01,562
Wait for it.

96
00:04:01,577 --> 00:04:02,767
Jake, slow down.

97
00:04:02,773 --> 00:04:05,190
There's a zipper
on this thing.

98
00:04:05,893 --> 00:04:08,976
Oh, God, I can't hear my son
having sex.

99
00:04:29,111 --> 00:04:30,313
Wow.

100
00:04:34,792 --> 00:04:35,960
Excuse me?

101
00:04:35,979 --> 00:04:39,137
I'm sorry.
That-that was involuntary.

102
00:04:40,518 --> 00:04:42,650
I just think
you're very beautiful.

103
00:04:43,182 --> 00:04:44,978
Thank you.

104
00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:48,017
If we weren't in a library,
I would have applauded.

105
00:04:48,624 --> 00:04:50,033
Got it.

106
00:04:50,076 --> 00:04:51,826
Thanks.

107
00:04:54,986 --> 00:04:56,415
I'm sorry.

108
00:04:56,439 --> 00:04:58,589
What are you doing here?

109
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:01,286
Nobody goes
to the library anymore.

110
00:05:01,403 --> 00:05:04,127
Oh, it's one of the few places
that I can go to

111
00:05:04,149 --> 00:05:06,426
where strange men
don't hit on me.

112
00:05:07,643 --> 00:05:09,092
Oh.

113
00:05:10,426 --> 00:05:12,494
Sorry. I just...
I'll leave you alone.

114
00:05:15,603 --> 00:05:17,623
I come here 'cause
they have a great collection

115
00:05:17,646 --> 00:05:19,813
of Thomas Edison diaries.

116
00:05:20,010 --> 00:05:21,902
They're very illuminating.

117
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:26,351
Get it?
Thomas Edison's...

118
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:28,323
The lightbulb?

119
00:05:30,091 --> 00:05:31,391
Never mind.

120
00:05:34,417 --> 00:05:37,632
Just for the record,
I wasn't hitting on you.

121
00:05:37,962 --> 00:05:40,305
I was just making small talk.

122
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:42,493
Duly noted.

123
00:05:42,556 --> 00:05:44,805
The last thing I would want
to do is hit on anyone.

124
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:47,377
I'm-I'm kind of taking
a timeout from the whole

125
00:05:47,401 --> 00:05:49,647
boy-meets-girl,
girl-dumps-boy,

126
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:52,597
boy-doubts-his-worth
as-a-human-being thing.

127
00:05:53,285 --> 00:05:54,497
Okay.

128
00:05:54,532 --> 00:05:55,814
Okay.

129
00:06:16,987 --> 00:06:19,572
Oh, for God's sake.
Would you like to join me?

130
00:06:19,574 --> 00:06:21,208
Oh, no, no, no.
I don't want to impose.

131
00:06:21,226 --> 00:06:23,043
Just get over here.

132
00:06:26,953 --> 00:06:28,433
I'm Walden.

133
00:06:28,458 --> 00:06:30,158
- Whitney.
- Hi.

134
00:06:30,169 --> 00:06:32,213
So, Whitney,
tell me about yourself.

135
00:06:32,234 --> 00:06:33,567
What do you do?

136
00:06:33,574 --> 00:06:35,449
Um, I'm an actress.

137
00:06:35,466 --> 00:06:36,846
How's that going?

138
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:38,164
Not so good.

139
00:06:38,178 --> 00:06:40,264
I haven't worked
in almost two years.

140
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:44,171
Ooh. Tough business,
or are you just not talented?

141
00:06:48,537 --> 00:06:51,605
What do you mean,
am I just not talented?

142
00:06:51,876 --> 00:06:54,551
You don't know me,
you don't know what I can do.

143
00:06:54,570 --> 00:06:56,829
You're lucky that I don't reach
under this table right now,

144
00:06:56,858 --> 00:06:59,605
rip off your balls
and feed them to you for dinner.

145
00:07:01,198 --> 00:07:03,461
I'm sorry. Sorry. My bad.

146
00:07:04,105 --> 00:07:06,244
And scene.

147
00:07:13,828 --> 00:07:15,712
- Hey.
- Hey.

148
00:07:15,714 --> 00:07:16,980
Where's Missi?

149
00:07:16,982 --> 00:07:18,631
She's unpacking.

150
00:07:18,633 --> 00:07:20,350
You know, for real.

151
00:07:20,352 --> 00:07:22,640
Right. I'm-I'm glad
you're having fun.

152
00:07:22,658 --> 00:07:25,593
Oh, I am. I can't imagine
ever being with anyone else.

153
00:07:25,619 --> 00:07:28,036
Yeah, yeah, I
remember that feeling.

154
00:07:28,064 --> 00:07:31,025
You, uh, kiss a girl,
see fireworks,

155
00:07:31,041 --> 00:07:33,052
and fall head-over-heels
in love,

156
00:07:33,067 --> 00:07:36,222
and then, one day you wake up
in a cold, loveless marriage

157
00:07:36,238 --> 00:07:37,870
with a soul-sucking shrew

158
00:07:37,891 --> 00:07:40,184
who makes you wish
for an early death.

159
00:07:40,513 --> 00:07:43,780
Oh, you realize
you're talking about my mother.

160
00:07:44,050 --> 00:07:46,349
Yeah. So you get it.

161
00:07:49,527 --> 00:07:52,145
So, anyway, after I
moved out to Los Angeles,

162
00:07:52,182 --> 00:07:54,229
I promised myself
I'd give it two years,

163
00:07:54,251 --> 00:07:56,147
and if I wasn't a star by then,

164
00:07:56,162 --> 00:07:58,350
I'd move home
and get a real job.

165
00:07:58,373 --> 00:08:00,129
So, how much time
do you have left?

166
00:08:00,147 --> 00:08:02,037
11 days.

167
00:08:02,264 --> 00:08:04,999
Well, that's four more
than God took.

168
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:08,366
God didn't have my agent.

169
00:08:08,427 --> 00:08:11,762
Listen, if I could hire you
to act, I would.

170
00:08:11,814 --> 00:08:14,264
Thank you.
I appreciate that.

171
00:08:16,273 --> 00:08:19,028
You know,
what if I could hire you?

172
00:08:19,061 --> 00:08:21,346
- For what?
- Well, stick with me

173
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:23,703
'cause I'm just thinking
out loud here.

174
00:08:23,911 --> 00:08:26,144
You see, here's the thing.

175
00:08:26,331 --> 00:08:28,369
I'm a serial monogamist,

176
00:08:28,410 --> 00:08:30,612
but I'm not very good
at relationships,

177
00:08:30,653 --> 00:08:32,911
'cause they're emotional
and they get messy,

178
00:08:32,923 --> 00:08:34,418
people fall in and out of love,

179
00:08:34,446 --> 00:08:36,062
and somebody always
ends up crying.

180
00:08:36,086 --> 00:08:37,894
That's usually me.

181
00:08:38,041 --> 00:08:40,681
Walden, I'm not going
to date you.

182
00:08:40,732 --> 00:08:43,546
Oh, no, I-I don't want you
to date me.

183
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:46,654
What if I hired you

184
00:08:46,691 --> 00:08:49,222
to play the role
of my girlfriend?

185
00:08:49,224 --> 00:08:51,036
You think I'm a hooker?

186
00:08:51,046 --> 00:08:53,230
No. No. No sex.

187
00:08:53,254 --> 00:08:55,417
Uh, you know,
take sex off the table.

188
00:08:55,447 --> 00:08:57,180
In fact, take it off the table,

189
00:08:57,211 --> 00:08:59,008
the car, the floor, the bed,

190
00:08:59,026 --> 00:09:01,343
the windmill
at the putt-putt golf course.

191
00:09:01,356 --> 00:09:03,426
Okay, so,

192
00:09:03,544 --> 00:09:06,020
I'm supposed to just believe
that some random guy

193
00:09:06,041 --> 00:09:08,818
that I meet in the public
library is going to pay me

194
00:09:08,839 --> 00:09:11,351
to be his sex-free companion?

195
00:09:12,305 --> 00:09:14,838
How does this not end
with my head in a freezer?

196
00:09:17,148 --> 00:09:19,149
- Google me.
- What?

197
00:09:19,187 --> 00:09:21,773
Walden Schmidt.
Google me.

198
00:09:25,113 --> 00:09:27,648
Wow, that's a lot of zeros.

199
00:09:29,075 --> 00:09:33,817
Are you really a-a genius,
entrepreneur, philanthropist?

200
00:09:33,837 --> 00:09:36,271
I also fight crime.

201
00:09:37,696 --> 00:09:39,058
What do you say?

202
00:09:39,075 --> 00:09:41,174
You know
how weird this is, right?

203
00:09:41,197 --> 00:09:42,460
What is weird about wanting

204
00:09:42,474 --> 00:09:44,325
to control every aspect
of a relationship

205
00:09:44,353 --> 00:09:46,245
by using money as a weapon?

206
00:09:47,348 --> 00:09:49,082
Okay, let me rephrase that.

207
00:09:49,116 --> 00:09:51,032
How does five grand
a week sound?

208
00:09:51,047 --> 00:09:53,138
Sounds like
you've got a girlfriend.

209
00:09:57,018 --> 00:09:58,251
Morning.

210
00:09:58,292 --> 00:10:00,643
Morning. Where's Jake?

211
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:02,279
Oh, he's still sleeping,
'cause in the army,

212
00:10:02,287 --> 00:10:03,876
he has to get up at
4:00 in the morning.

213
00:10:03,884 --> 00:10:05,712
In the military,
that's 0400.

214
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:08,110
I don't understand why they need
the "oh" or the "hundred."

215
00:10:08,142 --> 00:10:10,550
What time is it? 4:00.
Boom! Done! Next!

216
00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:13,769
And I really
don't understand

217
00:10:13,790 --> 00:10:15,103
them watches without
the numbers on it.

218
00:10:15,123 --> 00:10:16,995
- I mean, I never know what time it...
- Missi?

219
00:10:17,007 --> 00:10:19,989
I love you dearly,
but you got to shut up.

220
00:10:20,377 --> 00:10:23,075
Well, all I heard was,
you love me dearly.

221
00:10:25,594 --> 00:10:27,656
Oh, you're here.

222
00:10:27,777 --> 00:10:29,821
And... action!

223
00:10:31,233 --> 00:10:32,966
You're adorable.

224
00:10:32,993 --> 00:10:35,977
I brought you an iced coffee,
no sugar, soy milk.

225
00:10:36,081 --> 00:10:38,264
That's exactly the way
that I like it.

226
00:10:38,457 --> 00:10:39,904
How did you know?

227
00:10:39,929 --> 00:10:42,399
You're my boyfriend.
It's my business to know.

228
00:10:42,706 --> 00:10:44,306
Okay, so, here's
what I'm thinking.

229
00:10:44,333 --> 00:10:47,806
Three words—
beer, wings, football.

230
00:10:47,829 --> 00:10:49,614
Okay, three more words—

231
00:10:49,644 --> 00:10:51,761
best... girlfriend... ever.

232
00:10:51,817 --> 00:10:53,850
- I'll just go get changed.
- Why?

233
00:10:53,877 --> 00:10:56,206
Oh, this is a smelly old shirt,
and I haven't showered.

234
00:10:56,229 --> 00:10:58,562
Stinky— just the way I like it.

235
00:10:59,179 --> 00:11:01,072
Oh, this is good.

236
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:04,711
Can I fart in the car?

237
00:11:10,232 --> 00:11:11,043
Hello?

238
00:11:11,057 --> 00:11:12,166
Sorry to disturb you, sir.

239
00:11:12,179 --> 00:11:14,535
Is this the residence
of Private Jake Harper?

240
00:11:14,571 --> 00:11:16,453
Yes, it is.
Is everything okay?

241
00:11:16,471 --> 00:11:18,771
No, sir.
He's absent without leave.

242
00:11:18,773 --> 00:11:20,507
H-He's AWOL?

243
00:11:20,509 --> 00:11:22,475
Now we both said it.

244
00:11:23,292 --> 00:11:25,436
If he doesn't return
to the base within 24 hours,

245
00:11:25,455 --> 00:11:27,443
he will be brought up
on charges.

246
00:11:27,456 --> 00:11:29,129
Oh. That's not good.

247
00:11:29,143 --> 00:11:31,389
No, sir. It's bad.

248
00:11:32,383 --> 00:11:35,285
Uh, well, I-I...
I haven't seen him.

249
00:11:35,310 --> 00:11:37,616
Uh, but, you know, if I...
if I do, I will, uh,

250
00:11:37,626 --> 00:11:40,068
I will get in touch right away.
Uh, immediately.

251
00:11:40,090 --> 00:11:41,070
Thank you, sir.
Okay.

252
00:11:41,086 --> 00:11:42,660
Here's our contact
information.

253
00:11:42,664 --> 00:11:44,247
Good day, sir.

254
00:11:48,214 --> 00:11:51,233
Jake!

255
00:11:51,758 --> 00:11:53,441
Jake?

256
00:11:53,470 --> 00:11:55,790
Not now, Dad.

257
00:11:55,844 --> 00:11:58,118
The military police
were at the door

258
00:11:58,141 --> 00:11:59,761
looking for you.

259
00:12:00,282 --> 00:12:02,991
- What did you tell them?
- I told them you weren't here.

260
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:05,204
Oh. Thanks.
See you at dinner.

261
00:12:13,376 --> 00:12:16,244
Are you kidding
me, Jake? AWOL?

262
00:12:16,282 --> 00:12:18,183
Come on, it's not
that big a deal.

263
00:12:18,206 --> 00:12:20,655
You could go to jail!

264
00:12:20,667 --> 00:12:23,982
Really?
That seems a little extreme.

265
00:12:24,448 --> 00:12:26,753
All right, all right, enough.
Just go get your things,

266
00:12:26,776 --> 00:12:28,142
and I'll drive you back
to the base.

267
00:12:28,153 --> 00:12:29,686
No. I'm staying
here with Missi.

268
00:12:29,693 --> 00:12:31,586
This is not a discussion.
Let's go!

269
00:12:31,592 --> 00:12:33,514
Dad, I'm not a kid anymore.

270
00:12:33,531 --> 00:12:35,943
I'm 18, and I'm in the army.

271
00:12:36,330 --> 00:12:39,291
You're using the excuse
that you're in the army

272
00:12:39,319 --> 00:12:41,472
to not go back to the army?

273
00:12:41,668 --> 00:12:44,112
Hey, why don't you let me
go try to talk to him?

274
00:12:44,144 --> 00:12:45,644
You think you can bring him
back to his senses?

275
00:12:45,646 --> 00:12:47,829
Oh, yeah, I'm real good at getting
people to do what I want 'em to do—

276
00:12:47,852 --> 00:12:49,682
back home they call me
the "People Whisperer"

277
00:12:49,691 --> 00:12:50,970
It's kind of like
the Horse Whisperer,

278
00:12:50,984 --> 00:12:52,975
except I do it with people
and I don't really whisper.

279
00:12:52,989 --> 00:12:54,390
Ooh, I tried it with
a horse one time.

280
00:12:54,404 --> 00:12:56,054
He was just looking
at me like I was crazy.

281
00:12:56,076 --> 00:12:57,442
Kind of like you're
doing right now.

282
00:12:57,468 --> 00:12:59,380
I'll go talk to Jake.

283
00:13:00,608 --> 00:13:03,053
She cannot become
my daughter-in-law.

284
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,967
Oh, good, you're
going back.

285
00:13:09,001 --> 00:13:11,369
Nope. You and me
are getting out of here.

286
00:13:11,398 --> 00:13:12,700
Where are we going?

287
00:13:12,718 --> 00:13:14,554
Doesn't matter.
I just want to be with you.

288
00:13:14,574 --> 00:13:17,259
Jake, I got to go back home;
I have a job.

289
00:13:17,261 --> 00:13:20,011
Hey, if I can leave the army,
you can leave your job.

290
00:13:20,013 --> 00:13:21,523
Whoa, slow down.

291
00:13:21,537 --> 00:13:24,872
Why? I love you
and you love me, right?

292
00:13:26,219 --> 00:13:27,730
Right?

293
00:13:28,884 --> 00:13:30,013
Jake...

294
00:13:30,033 --> 00:13:33,093
you have to know
how much I really like you.

295
00:13:33,225 --> 00:13:35,436
Oh, man.

296
00:13:35,527 --> 00:13:36,743
But...

297
00:13:36,762 --> 00:13:38,273
you're in good company,

298
00:13:38,294 --> 00:13:40,680
'cause I only really like
great things.

299
00:13:40,703 --> 00:13:43,099
You know, like
ice cream sundaes

300
00:13:43,123 --> 00:13:44,749
and jumping up and
down on bubble wrap

301
00:13:44,764 --> 00:13:46,527
and that cute little bear
in the toilet paper commercial

302
00:13:46,544 --> 00:13:48,544
that wipes his butt
on the trees.

303
00:13:48,784 --> 00:13:51,916
Okay, I heard it that time.
I do got to shut up.

304
00:13:55,986 --> 00:13:58,347
I brought you another beer.

305
00:13:58,366 --> 00:13:59,899
I don't know if I should.

306
00:13:59,926 --> 00:14:02,040
Oh, come on, drunk guys are hot.

307
00:14:02,098 --> 00:14:04,018
You know,
I got to tell you, Whitney,

308
00:14:04,037 --> 00:14:06,638
I am having
the best time with you.

309
00:14:06,665 --> 00:14:09,918
Good. 'Cause...
I think you're wonderful.

310
00:14:10,756 --> 00:14:12,557
Thanks.

311
00:14:14,183 --> 00:14:16,268
Do you really mean that?

312
00:14:16,270 --> 00:14:17,485
Of course I do.

313
00:14:17,509 --> 00:14:19,498
You're smart,
you're funny,

314
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:21,969
not to mention very handsome.

315
00:14:22,007 --> 00:14:23,807
Ah. Too late,
you mentioned it.

316
00:14:25,375 --> 00:14:27,168
You know, but seriously...

317
00:14:27,196 --> 00:14:29,362
I am so glad I met you.

318
00:14:29,941 --> 00:14:31,127
Thanks.

319
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:32,973
Me, too.

320
00:14:35,835 --> 00:14:37,888
See, here's the thing.

321
00:14:39,212 --> 00:14:40,742
I really mean it.

322
00:14:40,761 --> 00:14:42,177
So do I.

323
00:14:42,179 --> 00:14:44,248
Okay, see, I don't know
if you're just saying that

324
00:14:44,270 --> 00:14:45,665
because I'm paying you,

325
00:14:45,685 --> 00:14:47,969
or if you really believe it.

326
00:14:47,991 --> 00:14:50,408
How does it feel to you?

327
00:14:51,249 --> 00:14:53,304
It feels like you mean it.

328
00:14:53,493 --> 00:14:55,505
Then that's all that matters.

329
00:14:55,578 --> 00:14:57,239
Wh... No, it's not.

330
00:14:57,259 --> 00:14:59,843
See... I want to know

331
00:14:59,855 --> 00:15:01,900
if it's for real real

332
00:15:01,921 --> 00:15:04,588
or if it's "Best Performance
by a Girlfriend

333
00:15:04,607 --> 00:15:06,941
Hired in a Library" real.

334
00:15:06,989 --> 00:15:09,400
Because on my end, it is real.

335
00:15:09,815 --> 00:15:11,698
Me, too.

336
00:15:12,001 --> 00:15:14,348
Okay, if I wasn't paying you,

337
00:15:14,458 --> 00:15:16,360
would you still feel that?

338
00:15:16,396 --> 00:15:19,275
It wouldn't matter
if you were paying me or not.

339
00:15:19,416 --> 00:15:20,884
But I am paying you.

340
00:15:20,904 --> 00:15:23,512
Which doesn't change
the way I feel.

341
00:15:25,055 --> 00:15:27,178
Okay, let's try this
another way.

342
00:15:28,424 --> 00:15:31,643
I want you to feel

343
00:15:31,645 --> 00:15:33,845
that it's really real...

344
00:15:33,847 --> 00:15:36,264
for real real.

345
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:37,820
And that...

346
00:15:37,846 --> 00:15:40,263
is exactly how I feel.

347
00:15:40,672 --> 00:15:42,549
Son of a bitch!

348
00:15:48,873 --> 00:15:50,157
Hey.

349
00:15:50,343 --> 00:15:51,658
Hey.

350
00:15:51,694 --> 00:15:52,869
You okay?

351
00:15:52,893 --> 00:15:54,150
What do you care?

352
00:15:54,164 --> 00:15:56,231
Come on, Jake, you know I care.

353
00:15:57,092 --> 00:15:58,957
I feel so stupid.

354
00:15:58,977 --> 00:16:00,326
No.

355
00:16:01,059 --> 00:16:03,325
You're not stupid.

356
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:06,511
You want to hear stupid?

357
00:16:06,536 --> 00:16:09,068
One time I drank an entire
blueberry Slurpee in one slurp,

358
00:16:09,082 --> 00:16:12,217
had a three-hour brain freeze
and my pee looked like Windex.

359
00:16:12,402 --> 00:16:14,285
What the hell
are you talking about?

360
00:16:14,315 --> 00:16:17,149
I don't know,
I'm not real good with silence.

361
00:16:17,319 --> 00:16:20,693
Just... promise me
you'll go back to the army.

362
00:16:21,306 --> 00:16:23,644
Yeah, I'm going back.

363
00:16:23,707 --> 00:16:25,323
Good.

364
00:16:26,265 --> 00:16:29,267
Hey... we did have
some fun, though, right?

365
00:16:29,617 --> 00:16:31,751
Yeah, we did.

366
00:16:32,004 --> 00:16:34,548
Well, just remember that part.

367
00:16:38,994 --> 00:16:40,962
Good-bye, Jake.

368
00:16:52,953 --> 00:16:56,039
Where am I gonna find
another girl named Missi?

369
00:17:00,095 --> 00:17:01,612
Hey.

370
00:17:01,898 --> 00:17:03,448
Hey.

371
00:17:04,117 --> 00:17:05,410
Where's your new girlfriend?

372
00:17:05,435 --> 00:17:07,580
Ah, she's off
for the day.

373
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:10,498
Where's your boyfriend?

374
00:17:10,531 --> 00:17:13,282
We... kind of broke up.

375
00:17:13,305 --> 00:17:14,854
How come?

376
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:17,782
You know, I just thought I was
coming here for a fun weekend,

377
00:17:17,814 --> 00:17:19,719
no strings attached, but...

378
00:17:19,749 --> 00:17:21,584
then Jake told me
that he loved me

379
00:17:21,606 --> 00:17:23,339
and I just couldn't say it back.

380
00:17:23,363 --> 00:17:24,331
Ouch.

381
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:26,705
I wasn't trying to hurt him.
It's just...

382
00:17:27,844 --> 00:17:30,028
he's not my soul mate.

383
00:17:30,030 --> 00:17:32,663
Well, I hate to break it to you,

384
00:17:32,665 --> 00:17:35,467
but... there is no such thing.

385
00:17:35,469 --> 00:17:36,905
That's not true.

386
00:17:36,914 --> 00:17:38,742
Everybody has a soul mate.

387
00:17:38,772 --> 00:17:40,104
And when
you find yours,

388
00:17:40,106 --> 00:17:41,396
it's like that feeling you get

389
00:17:41,411 --> 00:17:43,157
after the first big
snowfall of the year.

390
00:17:43,172 --> 00:17:44,843
You race outside
to go sledding

391
00:17:44,861 --> 00:17:47,533
and you go to the top of
the steepest hill you can find,

392
00:17:47,567 --> 00:17:49,544
and, you know, your heart starts
racing and you get all sweaty,

393
00:17:49,566 --> 00:17:51,873
even though all your boogers
are frozen over,

394
00:17:51,903 --> 00:17:53,069
and... the next
thing you know,

395
00:17:53,086 --> 00:17:54,569
you are zipping down
Montague Street,

396
00:17:54,571 --> 00:17:57,287
laughing and crying
all at the same time,

397
00:17:57,310 --> 00:17:59,176
and you never want it to end.

398
00:17:59,201 --> 00:18:01,635
And that's what real love
should feel like.

399
00:18:02,561 --> 00:18:05,396
Nobody should settle
for anything less.

400
00:18:06,198 --> 00:18:08,310
Remember when I told you
to shut up earlier?

401
00:18:08,334 --> 00:18:09,626
I'm sorry. I know.

402
00:18:09,641 --> 00:18:11,117
No.

403
00:18:11,204 --> 00:18:13,972
Don't ever listen to me again.

404
00:18:14,890 --> 00:18:17,025
'Cause that was awesome.

405
00:18:20,350 --> 00:18:21,684
Where you going?

406
00:18:21,701 --> 00:18:23,429
I'm gonna go see
if my girlfriend

407
00:18:23,442 --> 00:18:26,036
wants to really
be my girlfriend.

408
00:18:27,823 --> 00:18:30,825
And the People Whisperer
strikes again.

409
00:18:33,914 --> 00:18:35,856
And we're flying
down the hill

410
00:18:35,871 --> 00:18:37,171
and you're all sweaty

411
00:18:37,197 --> 00:18:39,694
and there are, like,
boogers frozen everywhere,

412
00:18:39,749 --> 00:18:41,646
and... the point is,

413
00:18:41,673 --> 00:18:44,507
I want to share
that feeling with you.

414
00:18:45,579 --> 00:18:47,480
For real.

415
00:18:47,873 --> 00:18:49,819
I'm gay.

416
00:18:52,575 --> 00:18:53,854
What?

417
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:55,953
I like women.

418
00:18:56,491 --> 00:18:58,441
For real?

419
00:18:58,663 --> 00:19:00,533
For real.

420
00:19:00,585 --> 00:19:02,237
Wow.

421
00:19:02,283 --> 00:19:04,766
You're a really good actor.

422
00:19:05,641 --> 00:19:06,941
Thank you.

423
00:19:07,134 --> 00:19:09,051
Do you want to go
to a movie tomorrow?

424
00:19:09,069 --> 00:19:11,175
Sure, yeah.
That sounds great.

425
00:19:12,132 --> 00:19:13,223
I love you.

426
00:19:13,234 --> 00:19:14,464
Love you, too, honey!

427
00:19:20,909 --> 00:19:22,444
You all right, buddy?

428
00:19:22,445 --> 00:19:24,476
I'm fine.

429
00:19:25,255 --> 00:19:27,222
It's okay to be upset.

430
00:19:27,259 --> 00:19:29,445
I'm not upset.

431
00:19:30,845 --> 00:19:33,644
if you were, I-I
would understand.

432
00:19:33,836 --> 00:19:36,436
I mean, you give
yourself to somebody,

433
00:19:36,463 --> 00:19:39,548
you finally let down
all your walls, and...

434
00:19:39,802 --> 00:19:42,052
then they break
your heart.

435
00:19:42,253 --> 00:19:43,921
Yeah.

436
00:19:44,577 --> 00:19:47,272
I'm really sorry
you have to go through this.

437
00:19:47,302 --> 00:19:48,646
I mean...

438
00:19:48,688 --> 00:19:51,803
it just... it kills me
to see you in pain.

439
00:19:51,986 --> 00:19:55,024
I mean, I-I know
you're a soldier now,

440
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:58,575
but... you're still
my little baby boy.

441
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:01,253
You know, I-I remember bringing
you home from the hospital,

442
00:20:01,270 --> 00:20:04,188
wrapped in your...
fuzzy blue blanket.

443
00:20:05,692 --> 00:20:08,400
I love you so much.

444
00:20:08,974 --> 00:20:10,767
I just...
I-I just wish

445
00:20:10,778 --> 00:20:13,009
I hurt instead
of you.

446
00:20:13,237 --> 00:20:15,130
Dad... it's okay.

447
00:20:15,149 --> 00:20:17,314
No, no, it's not okay!

448
00:20:17,841 --> 00:20:19,347
Maybe I should drive.

449
00:20:19,358 --> 00:20:21,660
Yeah, yeah, that's
a good idea.

450
00:20:21,871 --> 00:20:23,522
Thank you.

451
00:20:24,279 --> 00:20:26,363
All I'm saying is,
you can't give up.

452
00:20:26,389 --> 00:20:28,034
Your soul mate's
out there.

453
00:20:28,058 --> 00:20:29,290
Yeah, I don't know, Missi.

454
00:20:29,299 --> 00:20:31,604
You just got to keep
your eyes and your heart open.

455
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:33,128
You know, you never know
where you're gonna find her.

456
00:20:33,142 --> 00:20:34,532
She could be anywhere
right now. Hey,

457
00:20:34,567 --> 00:20:36,350
she might even be
at a Costco, wearing a apron,

458
00:20:36,352 --> 00:20:38,352
passing out egg rolls, so you
can sample the dipping sauce.

459
00:20:38,354 --> 00:20:40,820
Little tip:
avoid the Chinese mustard.

460
00:20:40,854 --> 00:20:43,782
Feels good going in,
not so good coming out.

461
00:20:44,438 --> 00:20:46,719
Let's just hope I find
her before I get old.

462
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:49,147
Ooh, then you
better hurry up, Grandpa.

463
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:52,178
Hey, let's make a deal.

464
00:20:52,204 --> 00:20:53,658
Next time you're in town,

465
00:20:53,671 --> 00:20:55,632
assuming you haven't
found anyone

466
00:20:55,648 --> 00:20:57,026
and I haven't found anyone,

467
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:58,820
what do you say
that you and I...

468
00:20:58,836 --> 00:21:00,168
Ew.

469
00:21:01,783 --> 00:21:04,568
I was gonna say
help each other find someone!

470
