1
00:00:05,614 --> 00:00:07,581
Oh. Hey.
Hey.

2
00:00:07,583 --> 00:00:09,250
I thought you and Alan
were going out to dinner.

3
00:00:09,252 --> 00:00:11,051
We were supposed to,
but then he discovered

4
00:00:11,053 --> 00:00:13,120
his coupon was only good
for to-go orders.

5
00:00:13,122 --> 00:00:15,489
That guy's a piece of work.

6
00:00:15,491 --> 00:00:16,457
He is.

7
00:00:16,459 --> 00:00:17,658
Which is ironic,

8
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:20,044
'cause he never seems
to go to work.

9
00:00:20,046 --> 00:00:22,263
That's true.

10
00:00:22,265 --> 00:00:23,130
That being said,

11
00:00:23,132 --> 00:00:24,665
I do envy what
you guys have.

12
00:00:24,667 --> 00:00:26,967
You guys are like termites.

13
00:00:26,969 --> 00:00:29,103
Termites?

14
00:00:29,105 --> 00:00:31,004
Yeah, they mate for life,
and once they live

15
00:00:31,006 --> 00:00:32,606
in your house,
you can never get rid of 'em.

16
00:00:33,809 --> 00:00:36,727
Just like Alan.

17
00:00:36,729 --> 00:00:38,062
You all right?

18
00:00:38,064 --> 00:00:40,364
Yeah, I...

19
00:00:40,366 --> 00:00:42,032
I have to do something
with him tonight

20
00:00:42,034 --> 00:00:43,484
that's going to be
really painful.

21
00:00:43,486 --> 00:00:46,120
Okay, that's between
two consenting adults.

22
00:00:46,122 --> 00:00:48,155
No...

23
00:00:49,692 --> 00:00:51,242
I'm breaking up
with him.

24
00:00:51,244 --> 00:00:53,026
What?

25
00:00:54,129 --> 00:00:56,580
No, but you guys are great
together.

26
00:00:56,582 --> 00:00:59,333
You're so beautiful

27
00:00:59,335 --> 00:01:01,635
and smart and fun and...

28
00:01:01,637 --> 00:01:03,921
Alan's so...

29
00:01:03,923 --> 00:01:05,205
lucky.

30
00:01:06,391 --> 00:01:08,509
I don't want
to hurt him.

31
00:01:08,511 --> 00:01:10,728
Then do something else.

32
00:01:10,730 --> 00:01:12,879
Disneyland, dancing, bowling,

33
00:01:12,881 --> 00:01:14,765
pretty much anything
but break up with him.

34
00:01:14,767 --> 00:01:16,183
I have to.

35
00:01:16,185 --> 00:01:18,102
But you and I are his world.

36
00:01:18,104 --> 00:01:20,070
And if you leave,
I'll be his world.

37
00:01:20,072 --> 00:01:21,405
I'm sorry.

38
00:01:21,407 --> 00:01:22,906
No, I don't think
you heard me.

39
00:01:22,908 --> 00:01:25,075
I'll. Be. His. World.

40
00:01:25,077 --> 00:01:27,945
I feel so bad.

41
00:01:28,998 --> 00:01:30,731
All right.

42
00:01:30,733 --> 00:01:31,899
Come here.

43
00:01:33,868 --> 00:01:37,004
This is the hardest thing
I've ever had to do.

44
00:01:37,006 --> 00:01:39,673
And I pushed a baby
out of my vagina.

45
00:01:40,843 --> 00:01:42,710
I'm back!

46
00:01:43,763 --> 00:01:45,746
Don't say anything.

47
00:01:45,748 --> 00:01:48,132
Oh. Hey, Walden.
Want to join us?

48
00:01:48,134 --> 00:01:51,051
Uh... no, thanks.

49
00:01:51,053 --> 00:01:53,721
Hey, what do you say
we all go bowling?

50
00:01:53,723 --> 00:01:55,422
Huh?

51
00:01:55,424 --> 00:01:56,857
Doesn't that sound fun?

52
00:01:56,859 --> 00:01:58,392
Just bowling?

53
00:01:58,394 --> 00:02:01,261
No, I... I think we're
just gonna stay in tonight.

54
00:02:01,263 --> 00:02:03,263
Uh... oh, but I have
a confession to make.

55
00:02:03,265 --> 00:02:05,766
I, uh, opened my fortune
cookie in the car...

56
00:02:05,768 --> 00:02:07,117
and listen to this:

57
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:10,237
uh... "your life is about to
take a turn for the better."

58
00:02:14,576 --> 00:02:18,045
I think you may have gotten
Lyndsey's cookie.

Another Night With Neil Diamond

Resync for WEBDL by lost0ne

67
00:02:47,417 --> 00:02:48,850
Would you like another
glass of wi...?

68
00:02:48,852 --> 00:02:50,018
Yes.

69
00:02:57,894 --> 00:02:59,394
Oh, you know,
I was thinking, uh...

70
00:02:59,396 --> 00:03:01,797
after dinner we could
light a fire.

71
00:03:01,799 --> 00:03:03,899
Don't worry, I've got all
the wood we'll need.

72
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:13,408
Cute.

73
00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:16,144
Just, uh... you seem
awfully quiet tonight.

74
00:03:16,146 --> 00:03:17,179
Is everything okay?

75
00:03:17,181 --> 00:03:19,548
I-I've just got
a lot on my mind.

76
00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:21,550
Hmm, what is it,
sweetie?

77
00:03:21,552 --> 00:03:23,552
Oh, boy.

78
00:03:23,554 --> 00:03:24,786
I don't know
how to say this.

79
00:03:24,788 --> 00:03:27,622
Well, a problem shared is
a problem halved.

80
00:03:27,624 --> 00:03:29,758
It's kind of like
that fried rice,

81
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,460
although I noticed
you didn't touch your half,

82
00:03:31,462 --> 00:03:33,528
despite the fact
that you had to order it,

83
00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:34,997
even though
the white rice is free

84
00:03:34,999 --> 00:03:38,100
and the coupon specifically
said "no substitutions."

85
00:03:38,102 --> 00:03:40,402
I think we should break up.

86
00:03:42,005 --> 00:03:43,138
Excuse me.

87
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:49,378
Are you okay?

88
00:04:06,696 --> 00:04:08,897
You owe me $22.50 for dinner.

89
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:12,684
Hey, Berta.

90
00:04:12,686 --> 00:04:14,903
Just finishing up.
Then I'll get out of your way.

91
00:04:14,905 --> 00:04:16,621
No, I think
you should stay here.

92
00:04:16,623 --> 00:04:18,073
All right.

93
00:04:18,075 --> 00:04:20,208
Let me take
a quick shower first.

94
00:04:20,210 --> 00:04:22,077
No.

95
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:24,379
Lyndsey's downstairs
breaking up with Alan.

96
00:04:24,381 --> 00:04:25,497
Really?

97
00:04:25,499 --> 00:04:26,548
Yeah.

98
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:29,835
Well... we knew this was coming.

99
00:04:29,837 --> 00:04:31,586
First time I saw them together,

100
00:04:31,588 --> 00:04:32,921
I asked her to blink twice

101
00:04:32,923 --> 00:04:34,873
if she was being held hostage.

102
00:04:34,875 --> 00:04:37,309
He's gonna be devastated.

103
00:04:38,561 --> 00:04:39,895
I mean, he's madly
in love with her,

104
00:04:39,897 --> 00:04:40,896
they've been dating for years,

105
00:04:40,898 --> 00:04:42,264
they were planning
on getting married.

106
00:04:42,266 --> 00:04:45,016
Oh, my God,
he's never gonna leave my house.

107
00:04:45,018 --> 00:04:48,904
It's sweet that you actually
thought he was going to.

108
00:04:48,906 --> 00:04:50,756
Why do people have to break up?

109
00:04:50,758 --> 00:04:52,491
Well, in my experience,

110
00:04:52,493 --> 00:04:54,192
either the magic wears off,

111
00:04:54,194 --> 00:04:55,694
or the mushrooms.

112
00:04:58,164 --> 00:04:59,664
I feel really bad for him.

113
00:04:59,666 --> 00:05:01,283
I mean,
I always feel bad for him.

114
00:05:01,285 --> 00:05:03,452
But I feel really bad for him.

115
00:05:03,454 --> 00:05:04,870
Yeah, yeah. It's tough.

116
00:05:04,872 --> 00:05:07,572
We gonna do this thing
or what?

117
00:05:12,128 --> 00:05:14,129
I don't understand.
Where is this coming from?

118
00:05:14,131 --> 00:05:16,014
There's no spark anymore.

119
00:05:16,016 --> 00:05:17,849
All we do is sit around,
watch TV and eat takeout

120
00:05:17,851 --> 00:05:19,801
from whatever restaurant
you have a coupon for.

121
00:05:19,803 --> 00:05:21,269
Did you want to go
to the food court?

122
00:05:21,271 --> 00:05:22,304
'Cause we can do that.

123
00:05:22,306 --> 00:05:24,723
Alan, it's not that.

124
00:05:24,725 --> 00:05:25,941
Then, what is it?

125
00:05:25,943 --> 00:05:27,476
I mean, I-I...
I thought you were happy.

126
00:05:27,478 --> 00:05:28,693
I-I thought
everything was great.

127
00:05:28,695 --> 00:05:31,262
It was, but, but things
change, people change.

128
00:05:31,264 --> 00:05:33,115
That's not true.
I don't change. I never change.

129
00:05:33,117 --> 00:05:35,700
Maybe that's part
of the problem.

130
00:05:35,702 --> 00:05:37,268
I can change.

131
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:38,904
I-I know this is upsetting,

132
00:05:38,906 --> 00:05:41,606
but, but better to do this
now before it gets worse.

133
00:05:41,608 --> 00:05:42,958
How can it be worse?

134
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,459
You gonna tell me you've been
faking it all these years?

135
00:05:44,461 --> 00:05:45,577
Don't answer that.

136
00:05:47,330 --> 00:05:48,380
Alan, I have to go.

137
00:05:48,382 --> 00:05:49,331
Fine, go.

138
00:05:49,333 --> 00:05:51,633
Don't go.

139
00:05:51,635 --> 00:05:53,752
I-I'm really sorry.

140
00:05:53,754 --> 00:05:56,505
The thing is, I-I
still love you, Alan.

141
00:05:57,924 --> 00:06:00,291
I'm just not in love
with you anymore.

142
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:06,765
It's not a deal-breaker.

143
00:06:09,986 --> 00:06:11,803
You okay?

144
00:06:11,805 --> 00:06:13,805
I guess.

145
00:06:13,807 --> 00:06:16,074
I suppose it's better that
she broke up with me now

146
00:06:16,076 --> 00:06:18,109
than after we got married.

147
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:21,363
Then she would've gotten
half of all my stuff.

148
00:06:26,602 --> 00:06:28,703
Sure.

149
00:06:30,706 --> 00:06:33,324
You know I'm
here for you.

150
00:06:33,326 --> 00:06:36,294
I know that and,
and I appreciate it.

151
00:06:36,296 --> 00:06:38,430
But... I'm good.

152
00:06:38,432 --> 00:06:39,631
Good.

153
00:06:41,584 --> 00:06:43,235
Walden?

154
00:06:43,237 --> 00:06:44,436
Yeah?

155
00:06:45,221 --> 00:06:47,171
I'm not good.

156
00:06:47,173 --> 00:06:49,474
I love her.

157
00:06:50,844 --> 00:06:51,977
I know you do.

158
00:06:51,979 --> 00:06:54,312
I'll never find another one
like her.

159
00:06:54,314 --> 00:06:56,448
I know you won't.

160
00:06:58,985 --> 00:07:01,736
I-I'm just saying, I-I
know how great she is.

161
00:07:01,738 --> 00:07:03,121
You're gonna be fine.

162
00:07:03,123 --> 00:07:05,690
Just... you have to focus on
the good things in your life.

163
00:07:05,692 --> 00:07:08,960
Lyndsey was the only
good thing in my life.

164
00:07:08,962 --> 00:07:11,046
Oh, God...
It's okay.

165
00:07:11,048 --> 00:07:13,031
Let it all out.

166
00:07:19,038 --> 00:07:22,140
That's a lot out.
Let's-let's put some back in.

167
00:07:25,846 --> 00:07:28,880
Now you're all I have!

168
00:07:41,777 --> 00:07:44,029
I know.

169
00:07:48,251 --> 00:07:49,501
Good morning.

170
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:51,369
Beautiful day.

171
00:07:51,371 --> 00:07:53,421
To... stick your head
in an oven?

172
00:07:55,091 --> 00:07:57,509
Okay, I realize I was a
little upset last night.

173
00:07:57,511 --> 00:07:58,843
A little?

174
00:07:58,845 --> 00:08:01,245
You Googled "how to kill
yourself without it hurting."

175
00:08:01,247 --> 00:08:03,114
Drama queen.

176
00:08:03,116 --> 00:08:05,150
But I woke up
this morning

177
00:08:05,152 --> 00:08:07,218
and I realized, "What
am I so upset about?"

178
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:09,087
Lyndsey and I are
not breaking up.

179
00:08:10,773 --> 00:08:12,324
Okay.

180
00:08:12,326 --> 00:08:16,027
So, when she said that she
didn't want to see you anymore

181
00:08:16,029 --> 00:08:18,380
and she didn't think you made
a good couple

182
00:08:18,382 --> 00:08:19,914
and she wasn't in love with you,
that...

183
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:21,066
What do you call that?

184
00:08:21,068 --> 00:08:23,768
Foreplay.

185
00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:26,437
Okay. Looks like someone's
starting the day

186
00:08:26,439 --> 00:08:28,790
with a hot, steaming cup
of denial.

187
00:08:28,792 --> 00:08:31,376
No, no, no. This is a little
dance we do all the time.

188
00:08:31,378 --> 00:08:33,211
She decides that
I did something wrong

189
00:08:33,213 --> 00:08:34,479
and gives me the business,

190
00:08:34,481 --> 00:08:35,647
and then I apologize,

191
00:08:35,649 --> 00:08:37,349
and I give her the business.

192
00:08:40,219 --> 00:08:41,803
Okay, see, that right there?

193
00:08:41,805 --> 00:08:43,755
That's why she broke up
with you.

194
00:08:43,757 --> 00:08:45,890
I'm telling you,
we are not broken up.

195
00:08:45,892 --> 00:08:48,259
Okay, I see what
you're doing here,

196
00:08:48,261 --> 00:08:50,862
but pretending like what
happened didn't happen

197
00:08:50,864 --> 00:08:52,097
won't make it not happen,

198
00:08:52,099 --> 00:08:55,433
no matter what you would like
to have had happened.

199
00:08:55,435 --> 00:08:57,268
Yeah, that's right.

200
00:08:57,270 --> 00:09:00,021
Well, thank you,
I appreciate it.

201
00:09:00,023 --> 00:09:02,490
But if you'll excuse me,
I'm gonna go get my girl back.

202
00:09:02,492 --> 00:09:04,009
Okay.

203
00:09:04,011 --> 00:09:06,244
Just in case,
I'll preheat the oven.

204
00:09:13,819 --> 00:09:15,887
Alan?

205
00:09:15,889 --> 00:09:17,288
What are you doing here?

206
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:19,374
What am I doing here?

207
00:09:19,376 --> 00:09:20,792
That's what I love about you.

208
00:09:20,794 --> 00:09:22,127
Okay, let's do this.

209
00:09:22,129 --> 00:09:24,546
I'm sorry.

210
00:09:26,465 --> 00:09:28,666
There's nothing
to be sorry about.

211
00:09:28,668 --> 00:09:30,435
Our relationship just
isn't going anywhere.

212
00:09:30,437 --> 00:09:33,271
All right, all right. Message
received, loud and clear.

213
00:09:33,273 --> 00:09:34,723
Now let's get down to bidness.

214
00:09:36,425 --> 00:09:38,777
Alan, it's over.

215
00:09:38,779 --> 00:09:40,178
But... but why?

216
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:42,364
I-It just is.

217
00:09:42,366 --> 00:09:44,282
Is it because we don't
like the same things?

218
00:09:44,284 --> 00:09:46,484
'Cause I can learn
to love sports.

219
00:09:46,486 --> 00:09:48,019
It has nothing
to do with that...

220
00:09:48,021 --> 00:09:49,320
Is it, is it
because I'm-I'm frugal?

221
00:09:49,322 --> 00:09:50,572
'Cause okay, watch this.

222
00:09:50,574 --> 00:09:54,209
I am going to rip a twent—
a five-dollar bill in half.

223
00:09:54,211 --> 00:09:55,410
Okay?

224
00:09:56,662 --> 00:09:59,164
Tell me that's not sexy.

225
00:09:59,166 --> 00:10:01,699
Okay, look...

226
00:10:01,701 --> 00:10:03,385
I didn't want
to have to say this,

227
00:10:03,387 --> 00:10:07,005
but the fact of the matter is...

228
00:10:07,007 --> 00:10:08,006
I've met someone else.

229
00:10:08,008 --> 00:10:09,758
Oh. Wow.

230
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:11,042
Wow. Uh...

231
00:10:11,044 --> 00:10:13,228
World spinning,
uh, gut tightening,

232
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:15,063
vomit rising... um...

233
00:10:15,065 --> 00:10:16,781
I'm really sorry.

234
00:10:16,783 --> 00:10:18,400
Well, well, who is he?
What's the difference?

235
00:10:18,402 --> 00:10:20,902
Well, I-I need to know
who my competition is.

236
00:10:20,904 --> 00:10:22,404
I-I need to know how I can win.

237
00:10:22,406 --> 00:10:24,739
You can't win.

238
00:10:24,741 --> 00:10:25,824
Good-bye, Alan.

239
00:10:27,928 --> 00:10:29,994
Well, I have got
news for you.

240
00:10:29,996 --> 00:10:33,081
The word "win" is not
in my vocabular...

241
00:10:33,083 --> 00:10:34,165
"Can't."

242
00:10:34,167 --> 00:10:37,001
The word "can't" is not
in my vocabulary.

243
00:10:37,003 --> 00:10:38,703
Damn it.

244
00:10:39,773 --> 00:10:41,906
Son of a bitch!

245
00:10:48,714 --> 00:10:50,748
Of course.

246
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:52,951
Dog crap.

247
00:11:01,630 --> 00:11:04,797
Hey, there's soup on the stove
if you want some.

248
00:11:04,799 --> 00:11:07,901
I wonder if Lyndsey's
new boyfriend likes soup.

249
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:10,320
He probably loves soup.

250
00:11:10,322 --> 00:11:12,672
And wears cable knit sweaters.

251
00:11:12,674 --> 00:11:14,691
"Look at me,
I'm eating soup

252
00:11:14,693 --> 00:11:17,277
"and wearing a sweater
while I bang the memory

253
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:19,162
of Alan Harper
out of this woman's mind."

254
00:11:25,419 --> 00:11:27,086
Alan, let it go.

255
00:11:27,088 --> 00:11:28,121
You brought it up.

256
00:11:28,123 --> 00:11:29,873
I brought up soup.

257
00:11:30,791 --> 00:11:33,009
I can't stop thinking about him.

258
00:11:33,011 --> 00:11:35,895
And her...
and what they're doing.

259
00:11:35,897 --> 00:11:38,515
And what position
they're doing it in.

260
00:11:38,517 --> 00:11:40,166
And where they're doing it.

261
00:11:40,168 --> 00:11:42,886
In the bed, in the shower,
at the Costco

262
00:11:42,888 --> 00:11:46,005
between the meat and the tires.
That was our place!

263
00:11:46,007 --> 00:11:48,958
That shouldn't be
anyone's place.

264
00:11:50,361 --> 00:11:52,228
And you're obsessing.
No, I'm not.

265
00:11:52,230 --> 00:11:54,347
Right, we all picture
our exes screwing

266
00:11:54,349 --> 00:11:56,399
between a rump roast
and a snow tire.

267
00:11:56,401 --> 00:11:58,902
You know what,
I-I'm gonna go for a drive.

268
00:11:58,904 --> 00:12:00,019
Where?

269
00:12:00,021 --> 00:12:01,821
Just out, you know, joyride.

270
00:12:01,823 --> 00:12:04,791
I've seen your car,
there's no joy in that ride.

271
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:08,244
Now where are you going?
I'm just gonna drive

272
00:12:08,246 --> 00:12:10,497
up the coast a little bit.
Take in the sea air.

273
00:12:10,499 --> 00:12:12,715
How? Your windows
don't roll down.

274
00:12:12,717 --> 00:12:15,084
Just the ones in the front. The
ones in the back don't roll up.

275
00:12:15,086 --> 00:12:16,803
Good-bye.

276
00:12:17,638 --> 00:12:19,923
I should buy him a new car.

277
00:12:19,925 --> 00:12:22,308
So he can live in it.

278
00:12:24,061 --> 00:12:25,762
♪ Men

279
00:12:25,764 --> 00:12:27,263
All right.

280
00:12:27,265 --> 00:12:29,098
Where are they?

281
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:33,403
They're probably
watching sports right now.

282
00:12:33,405 --> 00:12:36,222
"Hello, Lyndsey,
you don't mind if I watch

283
00:12:36,224 --> 00:12:39,725
"this baseball game
in the nude, do you?

284
00:12:39,727 --> 00:12:42,779
"Sure, you can kiss me
between the strikes

285
00:12:42,781 --> 00:12:45,615
and I'll kiss you
between the balls."

286
00:12:48,702 --> 00:12:51,371
Oh.

287
00:12:51,373 --> 00:12:53,006
Hey, Walden.

288
00:12:53,008 --> 00:12:54,924
Yeah, I'm just, uh,
you know, taking a drive

289
00:12:54,926 --> 00:12:57,794
down the Malibu coast,
trying to clear my head.

290
00:12:57,796 --> 00:13:00,096
Yeah, now I'm, uh,
I'm walking on the beach.

291
00:13:00,098 --> 00:13:02,048
Sand feels nice on my toesies.

292
00:13:07,304 --> 00:13:08,588
Walking on the beach, huh?

293
00:13:08,590 --> 00:13:09,772
Are you stalking me?

294
00:13:09,774 --> 00:13:11,024
Are you stalking Lyndsey?

295
00:13:11,026 --> 00:13:12,909
I asked you first.

296
00:13:12,911 --> 00:13:13,993
Look, this
is pathetic.

297
00:13:13,995 --> 00:13:15,111
Sitting outside
a woman's house,

298
00:13:15,113 --> 00:13:17,196
trying to catch of glimpse
of her through the window.

299
00:13:17,198 --> 00:13:18,698
What kind
of person does that?

300
00:13:21,952 --> 00:13:24,287
Hey, guys, what are we doing?

301
00:13:24,289 --> 00:13:26,573
Playing a little peek-a-boo
with Lyndsey?

302
00:13:26,575 --> 00:13:27,790
No.

303
00:13:27,792 --> 00:13:29,742
Yes.

304
00:13:29,744 --> 00:13:31,044
Lyndsey broke
up with Alan

305
00:13:31,046 --> 00:13:32,545
and he's having a hard
time understanding.

306
00:13:32,547 --> 00:13:34,247
Oh, well, one look
at the new guy

307
00:13:34,249 --> 00:13:35,248
and you'd understand it.

308
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:37,667
What, you've seen him?
Oh, yeah.

309
00:13:37,669 --> 00:13:38,585
Nick's gorgeous.

310
00:13:38,587 --> 00:13:39,719
Kind of looks like Walden.

311
00:13:39,721 --> 00:13:41,170
Aw, thank you.

312
00:13:41,172 --> 00:13:43,923
Y-You know his name,
so you-you've met him?

313
00:13:43,925 --> 00:13:45,725
Well, no,
but I've heard her yell it.

314
00:13:45,727 --> 00:13:48,394
It's either Nick
or Oh, God, Right There.

315
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:51,297
Oh, that's it.

316
00:13:51,299 --> 00:13:53,466
I got to see this Nick guy
for myself.

317
00:13:54,518 --> 00:13:56,802
No, Alan, don't.

318
00:13:56,804 --> 00:13:58,521
You're better than this.

319
00:13:58,523 --> 00:14:00,657
We both know
that's not true!

320
00:14:01,642 --> 00:14:04,694
Yeah, I feel for him.
It's got to be tough.

321
00:14:04,696 --> 00:14:06,812
Yeah, no doubt.

322
00:14:06,814 --> 00:14:09,282
You really are
a very handsome man.

323
00:14:09,284 --> 00:14:11,817
Again... thank you.

324
00:14:11,819 --> 00:14:15,838
It's not hard to imagine you
naked and cast in marble.

325
00:14:17,775 --> 00:14:20,159
Getting weird, Herb.

326
00:14:20,161 --> 00:14:22,128
Right.

327
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,018
All right.

328
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:30,353
Where are you, you homewrecker?

329
00:14:30,355 --> 00:14:32,639
Oh...

330
00:14:42,616 --> 00:14:44,567
That's better.

331
00:14:48,156 --> 00:14:50,373
Ugh.

332
00:14:51,875 --> 00:14:54,410
Can this get any worse?

333
00:14:54,412 --> 00:14:58,364
Oh, God, Nick, right there!

334
00:14:58,366 --> 00:15:01,033
Aw.

335
00:15:06,341 --> 00:15:07,390
Lyndsey,

336
00:15:07,392 --> 00:15:08,641
hey.

337
00:15:08,643 --> 00:15:09,692
Hey,

338
00:15:09,694 --> 00:15:10,927
I need your help.

339
00:15:10,929 --> 00:15:13,680
You need my help getting
back together with Alan?

340
00:15:13,682 --> 00:15:16,849
No. I need you to tell him
to stop calling, e-mailing,

341
00:15:16,851 --> 00:15:17,850
and texting me.

342
00:15:17,852 --> 00:15:19,218
Words and pictures.

343
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:20,853
Especially the pictures.

344
00:15:21,722 --> 00:15:24,157
He's just upset.
He means well.

345
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:25,858
Really?
Does this picture look

346
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:27,060
like he means well?

347
00:15:27,062 --> 00:15:29,662
Oh, dear God.

348
00:15:29,664 --> 00:15:33,266
Is he lying on my kitchen table?

349
00:15:33,268 --> 00:15:35,234
So, will you talk to him?

350
00:15:35,236 --> 00:15:39,255
Sure, right after I burn
my kitchen table.

351
00:15:39,257 --> 00:15:43,909
Thank you. By the way, you might
want to burn your bathtub, too.

352
00:15:44,929 --> 00:15:46,929
Oh, he's coming now.
Got to go.

353
00:15:50,217 --> 00:15:53,553
Hey. There he is.

354
00:15:53,555 --> 00:15:56,222
Looking good.

355
00:15:56,224 --> 00:15:58,274
Ha-ha.

356
00:16:00,361 --> 00:16:01,978
Where you going?

357
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:04,263
Lyndsey un-friended me
on Facebook.

358
00:16:04,265 --> 00:16:07,567
So I'm going to go
re-friend her with my face.

359
00:16:07,569 --> 00:16:09,168
No, you're not.

360
00:16:09,170 --> 00:16:10,770
You can't stop me.

361
00:16:20,113 --> 00:16:22,815
Damn you.

362
00:16:29,624 --> 00:16:31,307
Hey, Zip.

363
00:16:31,309 --> 00:16:33,092
Oh, what do you want?

364
00:16:33,094 --> 00:16:37,096
A motorcycle and another night
with Neil Diamond.

365
00:16:37,098 --> 00:16:39,565
But for now we need to talk.

366
00:16:39,567 --> 00:16:41,517
I just want to be left alone.

367
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:44,320
Like I'm gonna be
for the rest of my life.

368
00:16:44,322 --> 00:16:46,639
Look, Lyndsey's crazy
for breaking up with you.

369
00:16:46,641 --> 00:16:48,191
You are a great guy.

370
00:16:48,193 --> 00:16:49,408
You're just saying that.

371
00:16:49,410 --> 00:16:50,860
I know I'm rough on you,

372
00:16:50,862 --> 00:16:52,028
but that's just for fun.

373
00:16:52,030 --> 00:16:54,330
I really mean this.

374
00:16:54,332 --> 00:16:56,532
Oh, thank you.

375
00:16:56,534 --> 00:16:58,918
All right,
good talk.

376
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:00,319
How?

377
00:17:00,321 --> 00:17:01,838
What?

378
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:04,156
How am I a great guy?

379
00:17:07,428 --> 00:17:10,496
Well, you're
punctual.

380
00:17:10,498 --> 00:17:12,998
I-I do make it
a priority to be on time.

381
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,517
Yep.

382
00:17:14,519 --> 00:17:16,302
What else?

383
00:17:19,274 --> 00:17:20,690
Okay.

384
00:17:20,692 --> 00:17:24,060
You have pretty good toilet aim.

385
00:17:24,062 --> 00:17:26,979
And that's important
to a housekeeper.

386
00:17:26,981 --> 00:17:29,782
My secret is, I sit down.

387
00:17:30,634 --> 00:17:32,618
And that should've
stayed a secret.

388
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:34,036
Take care.

389
00:17:34,038 --> 00:17:35,454
Berta?

390
00:17:35,456 --> 00:17:38,574
What?

391
00:17:38,576 --> 00:17:40,977
I-I-If I'm such
a great guy,

392
00:17:40,979 --> 00:17:43,496
then why did
Lyndsey leave me?

393
00:17:43,498 --> 00:17:45,698
Oh, there's no telling
with chicks.

394
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:49,168
But don't worry...
you'll find somebody else.

395
00:17:49,170 --> 00:17:50,503
As good as Lyndsey?

396
00:17:51,673 --> 00:17:55,842
Look at you,
already making jokes.

397
00:17:59,263 --> 00:18:00,713
How'd it go?

398
00:18:00,715 --> 00:18:02,715
He's gonna die alone.

399
00:18:02,717 --> 00:18:04,717
And he pees sitting down.

400
00:18:09,189 --> 00:18:12,224
I really don't want
to be here, Walden.

401
00:18:12,226 --> 00:18:13,442
What are you
talking about?

402
00:18:13,444 --> 00:18:14,610
You're doing great.

403
00:18:14,612 --> 00:18:16,996
You shaved,
you showered.

404
00:18:16,998 --> 00:18:18,865
You realized wearing
Lyndsey's underwear

405
00:18:18,867 --> 00:18:21,701
wasn't a
long-term solution.

406
00:18:21,703 --> 00:18:23,569
I may have it together
on the outside,

407
00:18:23,571 --> 00:18:25,237
but on the inside
I'm still a wreck.

408
00:18:25,239 --> 00:18:27,957
I just want to go home and
eat ice cream on the toilet

409
00:18:27,959 --> 00:18:29,074
until I fall asleep.

410
00:18:29,076 --> 00:18:31,577
Would you listen
to yourself?

411
00:18:31,579 --> 00:18:33,846
Trust me, tonight
is going to be fun.

412
00:18:33,848 --> 00:18:36,415
Okay. But if it's not,
you're gonna have to watch

413
00:18:36,417 --> 00:18:37,750
The Notebook with me.

414
00:18:37,752 --> 00:18:40,085
Really? Again?

415
00:18:40,938 --> 00:18:42,638
Walden.

416
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:45,024
Oh, hey, Allie, hi.

417
00:18:45,026 --> 00:18:47,526
This is, uh, my friend Alan
I was telling you about.

418
00:18:47,528 --> 00:18:48,527
Hi, Alan.

419
00:18:48,529 --> 00:18:49,528
Hello.

420
00:18:49,530 --> 00:18:51,230
You two have
a lot in common.

421
00:18:51,232 --> 00:18:52,648
Really?

422
00:18:52,650 --> 00:18:54,734
You know your girlfriend's
new boyfriend, Nick?

423
00:18:54,736 --> 00:18:55,768
Yeah.

424
00:18:55,770 --> 00:18:57,904
I'm his
soon-to-be ex-wife.

425
00:18:58,639 --> 00:19:01,123
I'll just
let you two talk.

426
00:19:01,125 --> 00:19:03,337
Oh, oh... you know, I-I

427
00:19:03,362 --> 00:19:05,713
can see what Walden's
trying to do here,

428
00:19:05,714 --> 00:19:08,714
and he means well,
but, um, I-I don't know

429
00:19:08,716 --> 00:19:10,115
that I'm emotionally
ready to jump

430
00:19:10,117 --> 00:19:11,951
back into the relation...
How do you feel about revenge sex?

431
00:19:11,953 --> 00:19:13,252
Big fan. I'll
get the check.

432
00:19:21,678 --> 00:19:23,813
Well, well, well.

433
00:19:23,815 --> 00:19:26,365
Look who's doing
the walk of shame.

434
00:19:26,367 --> 00:19:28,784
More like the stride of pride.

435
00:19:29,853 --> 00:19:32,071
Guess who heard
"Oh, God, right there"

436
00:19:32,073 --> 00:19:34,457
multiple times last night?

437
00:19:34,459 --> 00:19:35,524
Not Nick.

438
00:19:35,526 --> 00:19:37,042
Well,
congratulations.

439
00:19:37,044 --> 00:19:38,644
I'm very happy
for you.

440
00:19:38,646 --> 00:19:40,880
I have you to thank you it.
Ah, I didn't do anything.

441
00:19:40,882 --> 00:19:43,249
Well, tracking Allie down
couldn't have been easy.

442
00:19:43,251 --> 00:19:44,366
It wasn't that hard.

443
00:19:44,368 --> 00:19:45,718
When we were
outside Lyndsey's house,

444
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:47,670
she was parked right behind us.

445
00:19:48,672 --> 00:19:51,140
Which is ironic,
because last night I was parked

446
00:19:51,142 --> 00:19:54,310
behind her...
I got it, I got it.

447
00:19:54,312 --> 00:19:56,428
I'm happy you're
feeling better.

448
00:19:56,430 --> 00:19:57,613
Oh, yeah.

449
00:19:57,615 --> 00:20:00,449
And let me tell you,
revenge sex is way better

450
00:20:00,451 --> 00:20:02,768
than revenge masturbation.

451
00:20:05,455 --> 00:20:09,191
Course, there's no reason
you can't do both.

452
00:20:13,664 --> 00:20:15,599
Oh, God, why am I eating
on this table?

453
