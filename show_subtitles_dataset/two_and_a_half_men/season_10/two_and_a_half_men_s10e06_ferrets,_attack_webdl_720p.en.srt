00:00:01,566 --> 00:00:03,380
Previously on:

2
00:00:03,433 --> 00:00:09,042
Zoey, will you do me the honor
of becoming Zoey Hyde...

3
00:00:09,763 --> 00:00:12,438
Tottingham-Pierce-Schmidt?

4
00:00:12,764 --> 00:00:15,315
No, I'm sorry!
I can't do it!

5
00:00:18,486 --> 00:00:20,550
I need an answer.

6
00:00:20,577 --> 00:00:22,377
There's someone else.

7
00:00:23,056 --> 00:00:25,291
Look, I'm just gonna be
alone for a while.

8
00:00:25,293 --> 00:00:27,894
And if the real thing
comes along, I'll know it.

9
00:00:28,243 --> 00:00:30,293
Excuse me.

10
00:00:30,633 --> 00:00:32,732
Can I have your nuts?

11
00:00:32,751 --> 00:00:34,321
This girl's really interesting.

12
00:00:34,339 --> 00:00:36,983
Actually, I think you know her.
Her name's Rose.

13
00:00:37,014 --> 00:00:38,663
See ya!

14
00:00:39,457 --> 00:00:40,907
She's devious and deceptive!

15
00:00:40,909 --> 00:00:43,259
She's probably listening to us
right now!

16
00:00:43,261 --> 00:00:45,762
Hey, Rose,
how ya doing?

17
00:00:46,154 --> 00:00:48,598
I told Alan that we met.
Boy, did you call that one.

18
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:50,633
Let me guess.
At some point did he say,

19
00:00:50,635 --> 00:00:52,865
"She's probably listening to us
right now"?

20
00:00:52,901 --> 00:00:55,588
"Hey, Rose, how ya doing?"

21
00:00:55,738 --> 00:00:57,824
He is very suspicious of you.

22
00:00:57,826 --> 00:00:59,175
Are you suspicious of me?

23
00:00:59,177 --> 00:01:01,060
More curious than suspicious.

24
00:01:01,062 --> 00:01:01,845
Good.

25
00:01:01,847 --> 00:01:03,992
So, what do you say?
Dinner?

26
00:01:04,005 --> 00:01:05,348
To dinner.

27
00:01:05,350 --> 00:01:08,465
It'll be nice to go out with
someone normal for a change.

28
00:01:17,996 --> 00:01:19,696
Yay!

29
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:22,749
Yay, indeed.

30
00:01:23,514 --> 00:01:26,669
Ooh, we went a mile
and a half.

31
00:01:26,671 --> 00:01:28,653
What is that,
a pedometer?

32
00:01:28,661 --> 00:01:30,924
Yes, I'm measuring
our sex life,

33
00:01:30,926 --> 00:01:34,162
and as of today, we are
in Laughlin, Nevada.

34
00:01:34,396 --> 00:01:36,629
Well, I believe I did most
of the driving.

35
00:01:36,631 --> 00:01:38,823
Yes. But when you got
a flat,

36
00:01:38,854 --> 00:01:40,944
I stopped and
pumped it up.

37
00:01:45,059 --> 00:01:48,885
Call me crazy— and the State of
California did for a while—

38
00:01:49,787 --> 00:01:52,946
but these last couple of weeks
have been the best of my life.

39
00:01:52,981 --> 00:01:55,220
They have been great.

40
00:01:55,352 --> 00:01:58,267
With the last mile and a half
being a particular high point.

41
00:01:58,419 --> 00:02:00,653
That's because
you finally stopped

42
00:02:00,666 --> 00:02:02,416
and asked for directions.

43
00:02:05,809 --> 00:02:07,710
Okay, I better get going.

44
00:02:07,712 --> 00:02:10,448
No, no.
Stay the night.

45
00:02:10,469 --> 00:02:12,584
All my stuff is
at my house, silly.

46
00:02:12,595 --> 00:02:13,728
What stuff?

47
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:15,544
I don't know.
My toothbrush.

48
00:02:15,564 --> 00:02:16,813
You can use mine.

49
00:02:16,833 --> 00:02:18,272
Ugh!

50
00:02:18,593 --> 00:02:20,758
After what we just did,
you're really concerned

51
00:02:20,779 --> 00:02:23,065
with having my toothbrush
in your mouth?

52
00:02:24,943 --> 00:02:28,379
I'm just saying, at some point
I have to go home.

53
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:33,742
What if you never
had to go home?

54
00:02:33,925 --> 00:02:36,516
Do you mean like you're
gonna tie me up

55
00:02:36,524 --> 00:02:39,142
and keep me bound
and gagged in the closet?

56
00:02:39,443 --> 00:02:44,931
Uh, no. I was thinking more
like you move in with me.

57
00:02:45,388 --> 00:02:47,792
Hmm, that's a little odd.

58
00:02:48,544 --> 00:02:50,660
I mean, come on.
You said so yourself,

59
00:02:50,676 --> 00:02:52,554
the last few weeks
have been fantastic.

60
00:02:52,573 --> 00:02:54,384
We get along great.
Why not?

61
00:02:54,417 --> 00:02:56,270
Why not?

62
00:02:56,355 --> 00:02:59,313
Because I don't want to be
a flavorless cracker.

63
00:02:59,704 --> 00:03:01,314
Sure.

64
00:03:01,872 --> 00:03:03,238
What?

65
00:03:04,685 --> 00:03:07,687
Well, you know when you order
a cheese plate

66
00:03:07,689 --> 00:03:10,347
and you get two different
kinds of stinky cheese

67
00:03:10,376 --> 00:03:14,193
and then you eat that little,
bland, unsalted cracker

68
00:03:14,195 --> 00:03:16,481
in between to cleanse
your palate?

69
00:03:17,054 --> 00:03:20,874
Not really, but you
explained it pretty well.

70
00:03:21,096 --> 00:03:24,087
Well, I don't want to be
the bland cracker.

71
00:03:24,103 --> 00:03:26,470
I want to be
the stinky cheese.

72
00:03:27,404 --> 00:03:29,421
Okay, I think I understand.

73
00:03:29,455 --> 00:03:31,421
You're concerned 'cause
I just got out

74
00:03:31,435 --> 00:03:32,915
of a serious relationship,

75
00:03:32,927 --> 00:03:34,892
and you don't want
to be the girl

76
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:36,212
that gets me to the next one.

77
00:03:36,221 --> 00:03:37,604
Exactly.

78
00:03:37,628 --> 00:03:39,861
Well, trust me.

79
00:03:40,188 --> 00:03:44,208
You are the stinkiest cheese
I have ever met.

80
00:03:45,592 --> 00:03:47,512
So sweet.

81
00:03:47,556 --> 00:03:50,228
I don't know,
it's moving so quickly.

82
00:03:50,259 --> 00:03:53,247
I mean, who could've seen
this coming?

83
00:03:54,798 --> 00:03:58,166
Now, I know it's moving quick,
but I'm the kind of person

84
00:03:58,192 --> 00:04:01,788
when I see something I want,
I stop at nothing to get it.

85
00:04:02,003 --> 00:04:05,275
Wow, I guess opposites
really do attract.

86
00:04:08,782 --> 00:04:13,553
Just promise me that
you'll think about it.

87
00:04:13,555 --> 00:04:17,111
And you'll think about
tying me up in your closet?

88
00:04:17,913 --> 00:04:19,229
I will.

89
00:04:19,607 --> 00:04:21,633
That seems fair.

90
00:04:24,098 --> 00:04:26,411
You know, if we get
started now, we can make it

91
00:04:26,438 --> 00:04:28,387
to Salt Lake City by daybreak.

92
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:33,016
Okay, but this time I'm driving.

93
00:04:59,526 --> 00:05:02,705
== sync, corrected by elderman ==
Resync for WEB-DL by ryangiggsth

94
00:05:05,029 --> 00:05:06,393
I can't believe this.

95
00:05:06,395 --> 00:05:08,328
- After everything she's done.
- I know.

96
00:05:08,330 --> 00:05:11,465
How did someone like that
worm their way back in here?

97
00:05:11,592 --> 00:05:14,526
Maybe she learned
from the master.

98
00:05:15,169 --> 00:05:17,633
I'm just worried she's gonna
take advantage of Walden.

99
00:05:17,669 --> 00:05:20,125
You do hear yourself
when you talk, right?

100
00:05:20,172 --> 00:05:23,180
Yes, yes, I'm a mooch,
but I'm not dangerous.

101
00:05:26,228 --> 00:05:29,644
Some night I'm gonna
get drunk and try that.

102
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:31,600
Here he comes.
Here he comes.

103
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:34,509
Morning.

104
00:05:34,523 --> 00:05:35,565
Morning.

105
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:38,586
So, uh, how's everything going
with my, my favorite couple?

106
00:05:38,615 --> 00:05:40,816
Walden and Rose.

107
00:05:40,990 --> 00:05:42,823
Wose.

108
00:05:44,008 --> 00:05:46,110
Ralden.

109
00:05:46,217 --> 00:05:48,801
Look, Alan, I know you're
suspicious of her,

110
00:05:48,821 --> 00:05:50,436
but she really makes me happy.

111
00:05:50,444 --> 00:05:52,172
No, I-I totally get that,
and, you know,

112
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:53,962
I don't want
to sound judgmental,

113
00:05:53,981 --> 00:05:56,482
but she scares
the living crap out of me.

114
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:58,211
Well, you're gonna have
to make peace with her

115
00:05:58,230 --> 00:06:00,347
'cause not only do I like Rose,

116
00:06:00,388 --> 00:06:02,182
I asked her to move in with me.

117
00:06:05,297 --> 00:06:06,692
What's so funny?

118
00:06:06,716 --> 00:06:08,899
If you don't know,
it's too late.

119
00:06:15,112 --> 00:06:16,712
Oh, that's my cell.

120
00:06:16,736 --> 00:06:18,636
Could you grab it for me?

121
00:06:19,633 --> 00:06:21,892
It says "Do not answer."

122
00:06:21,931 --> 00:06:23,964
That's Zoey.

123
00:06:24,916 --> 00:06:27,730
It reminds me to stay strong
and not take her calls.

124
00:06:27,763 --> 00:06:29,132
Hello.

125
00:06:29,717 --> 00:06:30,973
Hey, Zoey.

126
00:06:30,991 --> 00:06:32,798
What's going on?

127
00:06:34,119 --> 00:06:36,505
Uh, yeah,
I could do that.

128
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,185
She wants to go for coffee.

129
00:06:38,213 --> 00:06:39,546
Why?
I don't know.

130
00:06:39,566 --> 00:06:41,176
Ask her.

131
00:06:41,974 --> 00:06:46,233
Hey, uh, just so I have
a heads up, is this a...

132
00:06:46,482 --> 00:06:49,205
sad coffee or a happy coffee?

133
00:06:50,289 --> 00:06:51,910
It's a happy coffee.

134
00:06:51,918 --> 00:06:54,649
Great. Can you bring
me back a scone?

135
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,285
Shut up.

136
00:06:57,314 --> 00:07:00,235
Uh, yeah, great,
I'll be there in 20.

137
00:07:00,648 --> 00:07:01,896
Okay.

138
00:07:02,366 --> 00:07:03,816
So what do you think's going on?

139
00:07:03,837 --> 00:07:05,069
I don't know. Uh,

140
00:07:05,097 --> 00:07:07,551
she, she said she wants
to talk in person.

141
00:07:07,571 --> 00:07:10,109
Ooh, be careful— in my
experience, when an ex wants

142
00:07:10,142 --> 00:07:12,052
to talk in person,
it's either to borrow money

143
00:07:12,075 --> 00:07:14,358
or tell you she gave you crabs.

144
00:07:15,784 --> 00:07:18,235
And no one's ever
asked me for money.

145
00:07:19,301 --> 00:07:21,416
You share too much.

146
00:07:21,913 --> 00:07:24,630
Besides, she said
it was a happy coffee.

147
00:07:24,659 --> 00:07:26,831
Ooh, ooh! Maybe she wants
to have sex with the ex.

148
00:07:26,848 --> 00:07:28,170
That's happened to me.

149
00:07:28,199 --> 00:07:30,483
Be careful, that's how
I got the crabs.

150
00:07:31,608 --> 00:07:33,606
Well, I'm not going
to sleep with her.

151
00:07:33,623 --> 00:07:35,056
I'm with Rose now.
Right.

152
00:07:35,068 --> 00:07:37,535
Oh, are you gonna tell Rose that
you're meeting Zoey for coffee?

153
00:07:37,554 --> 00:07:39,653
Yes, I am not.

154
00:07:40,788 --> 00:07:41,772
Good call.

155
00:07:41,782 --> 00:07:43,126
Hey, how do I look?

156
00:07:43,154 --> 00:07:45,388
Like every screen saver
in San Francisco.

157
00:07:45,678 --> 00:07:47,950
Perfect. Okay.

158
00:07:47,986 --> 00:07:50,253
Hey, what does it say on
your phone when I call?

159
00:07:50,286 --> 00:07:53,297
Uh, it says, "The old guy
who lives downstairs."

160
00:07:57,183 --> 00:07:58,982
Perfect.

161
00:08:02,404 --> 00:08:03,897
Here we go.

162
00:08:03,941 --> 00:08:05,874
Happy coffee.

163
00:08:06,104 --> 00:08:07,477
Thank you.

164
00:08:07,807 --> 00:08:09,331
So, how have you been?

165
00:08:09,351 --> 00:08:11,088
Mmm, good. You?

166
00:08:11,105 --> 00:08:13,295
Good.
Good.

167
00:08:13,912 --> 00:08:16,369
- Are we done lying?
- Mm-hmm.

168
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:18,660
Okay, so here it is.

169
00:08:18,949 --> 00:08:21,206
Oh, God, this is
very embarrassing.

170
00:08:21,236 --> 00:08:23,086
Crabs?

171
00:08:27,929 --> 00:08:28,784
What?

172
00:08:28,794 --> 00:08:30,855
Nothing. Go on.

173
00:08:31,486 --> 00:08:34,865
So, when you asked me
to marry you...

174
00:08:35,744 --> 00:08:37,634
it scared me.

175
00:08:37,711 --> 00:08:38,601
Why?

176
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:40,803
I went down that
road before, Walden.

177
00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:42,657
I got lost.

178
00:08:43,451 --> 00:08:46,403
Just wasn't ready to make
that kind of commitment again.

179
00:08:47,355 --> 00:08:48,779
Wait a second.

180
00:08:48,807 --> 00:08:50,461
What about the other guy?

181
00:08:50,483 --> 00:08:51,565
Pe-ter.

182
00:08:53,454 --> 00:08:55,537
I broke up with him.

183
00:08:55,557 --> 00:08:57,287
So sorry.

184
00:08:57,329 --> 00:08:59,779
Oops, apparently
I'm not done lying.

185
00:09:01,385 --> 00:09:03,782
You care to know why
I broke up with Peter?

186
00:09:03,793 --> 00:09:06,514
Because he wasn't
a very good pumpkin eater?

187
00:09:10,461 --> 00:09:13,695
No, I broke up with him
because when I was with him,

188
00:09:13,714 --> 00:09:16,077
all I could think
about was you.

189
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:19,746
Oh, this is a very happy coffee.

190
00:09:21,687 --> 00:09:24,109
I'd like another chance, Walden.

191
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:26,781
My coffee is dancing.

192
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:30,844
So, do you want to try
and make this work?

193
00:09:30,881 --> 00:09:32,685
I do.

194
00:09:32,704 --> 00:09:34,433
But it's a little complicated.

195
00:09:34,463 --> 00:09:36,573
Oh, God, you're seeing
someone, aren't you?

196
00:09:36,588 --> 00:09:37,300
Well...

197
00:09:37,317 --> 00:09:39,367
Is it serious?

198
00:09:40,813 --> 00:09:43,214
Nobody's brought
their toothbrush over.

199
00:09:43,928 --> 00:09:46,507
I'm sorry, I've put you
in a very awkward position.

200
00:09:46,526 --> 00:09:49,045
No, no, it's okay.
I just...

201
00:09:49,325 --> 00:09:51,604
I need a little time
to figure it out.

202
00:09:51,635 --> 00:09:53,574
Of course you do.
I completely understand.

203
00:09:53,589 --> 00:09:55,236
Take all the time you need.

204
00:09:55,719 --> 00:09:57,770
You decided yet?

205
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,993
I'm kidding.

206
00:10:01,015 --> 00:10:02,632
Look, do what you need to do

207
00:10:02,661 --> 00:10:04,777
and let me know
what happens, okay?

208
00:10:06,934 --> 00:10:08,850
- Um...
- Thanks for meeting me.

209
00:10:08,861 --> 00:10:11,195
Yeah, I'm glad you called.

210
00:10:17,078 --> 00:10:18,995
Oh, boy.

211
00:10:19,205 --> 00:10:21,456
Crabs would've been simpler.

212
00:10:25,654 --> 00:10:27,354
You're not gonna believe this.

213
00:10:27,356 --> 00:10:30,085
Zoey realized she made
a huge mistake,

214
00:10:30,103 --> 00:10:31,385
and she wants me back.

215
00:10:31,393 --> 00:10:33,093
Is that crazy or what?

216
00:10:33,245 --> 00:10:34,667
No.

217
00:10:34,691 --> 00:10:35,958
No?

218
00:10:36,192 --> 00:10:38,423
Follow me.
I want to show you something.

219
00:10:46,017 --> 00:10:47,301
Rose?

220
00:10:47,334 --> 00:10:49,063
Oh, hi, sweetie.

221
00:10:49,096 --> 00:10:51,432
I brought my toothbrush.

222
00:10:52,472 --> 00:10:54,512
That's crazy.

223
00:11:01,602 --> 00:11:03,852
So,

224
00:11:03,899 --> 00:11:06,233
you decided to move in.

225
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:07,518
Yep.

226
00:11:07,568 --> 00:11:09,601
You make me so happy.

227
00:11:09,647 --> 00:11:12,244
Now we never have
to be apart.

228
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:13,413
Never?

229
00:11:14,167 --> 00:11:16,184
Never, ever.

230
00:11:17,373 --> 00:11:19,582
Now, if you'll excuse me,

231
00:11:19,626 --> 00:11:23,030
I'm going to go upstairs and
make sure the birds are settled.

232
00:11:25,108 --> 00:11:26,222
Great.

233
00:11:26,266 --> 00:11:28,257
Never, ever, ever.

234
00:11:30,827 --> 00:11:32,531
Did she say birds?

235
00:11:32,553 --> 00:11:34,154
Well, I counted four,

236
00:11:34,190 --> 00:11:37,343
but one of them might be dinner
for the ferrets.

237
00:11:38,658 --> 00:11:39,903
Ferrets?

238
00:11:39,931 --> 00:11:42,756
I think they were ferrets.
Might've been weasels.

239
00:11:42,786 --> 00:11:43,702
Either way,

240
00:11:43,723 --> 00:11:46,171
she recommended
we all get rabies shots.

241
00:11:46,791 --> 00:11:49,537
Oh, God,
what have I done?

242
00:11:49,579 --> 00:11:51,496
You asked her to move in.

243
00:11:51,545 --> 00:11:53,928
You invited the vampire
into the house.

244
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:57,690
In my defense, the vampire
was naked at the time.

245
00:11:57,725 --> 00:12:00,125
- So what are you going to do now?
- I don't know.

246
00:12:00,158 --> 00:12:02,033
I guess I'll just...

247
00:12:02,084 --> 00:12:04,518
man up and tell Rose
I made a mistake.

248
00:12:04,573 --> 00:12:06,428
Ooh, that's a bad idea.

249
00:12:07,217 --> 00:12:09,562
Especially before you
get the rabies shot.

250
00:12:09,597 --> 00:12:11,081
You got a better one?

251
00:12:11,109 --> 00:12:13,062
Well, let's see, um,
you could always tell her

252
00:12:13,079 --> 00:12:15,079
that your, your work
is taking you to Europe,

253
00:12:15,093 --> 00:12:16,773
or that you're dying

254
00:12:16,793 --> 00:12:18,625
or that you finally realized
you're gay

255
00:12:18,636 --> 00:12:21,138
and you're sick of fighting
the feelings you have for me.

256
00:12:25,849 --> 00:12:27,883
I'm not gonna lie to her.

257
00:12:27,953 --> 00:12:29,947
Would it be a lie?

258
00:12:36,171 --> 00:12:37,363
Look at us.

259
00:12:37,383 --> 00:12:38,634
We're like Siamese twins

260
00:12:38,659 --> 00:12:41,110
except we don't have
to share any organs,

261
00:12:41,356 --> 00:12:43,426
unless we want to.

262
00:12:45,912 --> 00:12:47,542
Listen,

263
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:51,027
I need to talk to
you about something.

264
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:52,641
Sure.

265
00:12:54,589 --> 00:12:56,579
Geez, this is tough.

266
00:12:56,588 --> 00:12:57,644
Just say it.

267
00:12:57,660 --> 00:13:00,244
I want us to be able
to talk about anything.

268
00:13:01,824 --> 00:13:04,092
Okay, here goes.

269
00:13:04,129 --> 00:13:05,753
Um...

270
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:10,585
I'm in love with Alan.

271
00:13:10,605 --> 00:13:12,540
- What?
- I'm dying.

272
00:13:12,558 --> 00:13:13,847
You're dying?

273
00:13:13,862 --> 00:13:15,762
For work. In Europe.

274
00:13:16,552 --> 00:13:17,987
Walden,

275
00:13:18,630 --> 00:13:20,797
what is going on?

276
00:13:22,993 --> 00:13:24,983
Okay, um...

277
00:13:29,113 --> 00:13:31,545
My old girlfriend called,

278
00:13:31,575 --> 00:13:34,029
and she wants to try again.

279
00:13:43,321 --> 00:13:45,787
How do you feel about that?

280
00:13:46,725 --> 00:13:50,021
I'd be lying if I said
I wasn't thinking about it.

281
00:13:50,068 --> 00:13:52,463
Are you still in love
with her?

282
00:13:55,157 --> 00:13:56,960
Yes, I am.

283
00:13:59,814 --> 00:14:01,782
I'm sorry, Rose.

284
00:14:05,408 --> 00:14:07,026
No.

285
00:14:09,294 --> 00:14:11,826
No, don't be sorry.

286
00:14:11,919 --> 00:14:14,234
Walden, we've only known
each other

287
00:14:14,236 --> 00:14:16,274
for a couple of weeks.

288
00:14:16,351 --> 00:14:18,998
And as wonderful
as it's been,

289
00:14:19,129 --> 00:14:22,057
if you feel that you'd be
happier with Zoey,

290
00:14:22,311 --> 00:14:25,039
I'm not gonna stand
in your way.

291
00:14:27,195 --> 00:14:28,812
Thank you.

292
00:14:31,603 --> 00:14:34,555
How did you know
her name is Zoey?

293
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:38,475
Zoey's a very popular name
in England.

294
00:14:39,207 --> 00:14:41,422
Wait, how did you
know she's English?

295
00:14:41,464 --> 00:14:44,114
Because her name's
Zoey, silly.

296
00:14:46,595 --> 00:14:48,379
Good-bye, Walden.

297
00:14:50,238 --> 00:14:52,305
Good-bye, Rose.

298
00:14:54,614 --> 00:14:57,360
You know I want you
to be happy, don't you?

299
00:14:57,572 --> 00:14:58,799
I do,

300
00:14:58,818 --> 00:15:01,254
and I want you to be happy, too.

301
00:15:01,468 --> 00:15:02,931
Thank you.

302
00:15:07,984 --> 00:15:09,978
Ferrets, attack!

303
00:15:19,065 --> 00:15:20,892
Hey, buddy, how're you doing?

304
00:15:20,916 --> 00:15:23,047
Great.
I got a promotion.

305
00:15:23,093 --> 00:15:24,462
No kidding.

306
00:15:24,481 --> 00:15:26,639
Yep. I'm the dessert chef
in the officer's mess.

307
00:15:26,654 --> 00:15:27,816
Wow.

308
00:15:27,849 --> 00:15:29,632
Yeah, I made
this killer crème brûlée

309
00:15:29,652 --> 00:15:31,569
for the enlisted guys
and word got out.

310
00:15:31,591 --> 00:15:33,891
Jake, I am so proud of you.

311
00:15:33,908 --> 00:15:35,528
Yeah, they gave me
my own blow torch.

312
00:15:35,541 --> 00:15:36,940
You know,
to caramelize the sugar.

313
00:15:36,952 --> 00:15:38,267
Check it out.

314
00:15:40,406 --> 00:15:41,488
Uh-oh.

315
00:15:41,490 --> 00:15:43,209
Not again.

316
00:15:44,496 --> 00:15:46,264
Got to go, Dad.

317
00:15:49,972 --> 00:15:52,974
Well,
he's America's problem now.

318
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:00,986
Hi.

319
00:16:02,249 --> 00:16:03,542
Hello?

320
00:16:03,559 --> 00:16:04,843
Sorry to bother you.

321
00:16:04,859 --> 00:16:06,533
I'm a friend of Walden's.

322
00:16:06,568 --> 00:16:08,061
Oh, really?

323
00:16:08,083 --> 00:16:11,171
Yes, and we need to talk.

324
00:16:11,748 --> 00:16:13,548
About what?

325
00:16:13,891 --> 00:16:15,994
It's complicated.

326
00:16:22,626 --> 00:16:24,186
I'll get it.

327
00:16:30,674 --> 00:16:32,558
- Zoey?
- Who the hell is...

328
00:16:32,575 --> 00:16:34,195
What has happened
to your face?

329
00:16:34,215 --> 00:16:36,065
I was attacked by ferrets.

330
00:16:36,875 --> 00:16:38,915
Fine, don't tell me.

331
00:16:39,053 --> 00:16:40,979
Who the hell
is that crazy woman

332
00:16:41,008 --> 00:16:44,125
who just showed up at my house
saying she's carrying your baby?

333
00:16:44,419 --> 00:16:45,067
Uh...

334
00:16:45,087 --> 00:16:46,915
I have a guess.

335
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,236
Alan, please.

336
00:16:49,412 --> 00:16:51,049
Do you know anything
about this?

337
00:16:51,087 --> 00:16:53,221
All right, I'm just
gonna level with you.

338
00:16:53,258 --> 00:16:56,411
You moved on, so I was trying
to do the same thing,

339
00:16:56,448 --> 00:16:57,748
but she's not pregnant.

340
00:16:57,750 --> 00:16:59,516
Then, why in the world
would she show up

341
00:16:59,518 --> 00:17:01,135
at my apartment
claiming to be?

342
00:17:01,153 --> 00:17:02,511
Apparently she is crazy.

343
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:04,809
- Told you.
- Alan!

344
00:17:05,022 --> 00:17:06,289
Shut up!

345
00:17:09,487 --> 00:17:11,054
All right, look,

346
00:17:11,396 --> 00:17:14,721
as soon as you told me that
you wanted to get back together,

347
00:17:14,744 --> 00:17:17,581
I told her she had to move out
because I was in love with you.

348
00:17:17,591 --> 00:17:18,928
And that's the truth.

349
00:17:18,954 --> 00:17:20,470
I love you, Zoey.

350
00:17:20,472 --> 00:17:22,405
Wait, she was living here?

351
00:17:22,413 --> 00:17:24,988
Did you hear the part
where I said I love you?

352
00:17:25,578 --> 00:17:28,211
What happened to "no one's
brought their toothbrush"?

353
00:17:28,477 --> 00:17:29,693
That...

354
00:17:29,803 --> 00:17:30,552
Alan?

355
00:17:30,567 --> 00:17:31,966
You told me to shut up.

356
00:17:31,995 --> 00:17:33,526
God.

357
00:17:33,552 --> 00:17:35,185
Good-bye, Walden.

358
00:17:35,187 --> 00:17:37,911
Zoey, wait, you're
my stinky cheese!

359
00:17:41,925 --> 00:17:43,295
Great.

360
00:17:43,328 --> 00:17:46,229
Aw, I'm sorry, buddy.

361
00:17:47,263 --> 00:17:49,395
But look at the bright side...

362
00:17:49,428 --> 00:17:51,844
I know, I still have you.

363
00:17:52,625 --> 00:17:54,971
For ever and ever and ever.

364
00:17:56,991 --> 00:17:59,217
Hey, why don't we go out?

365
00:17:59,254 --> 00:18:00,837
You know,
maybe-maybe grab a bite?

366
00:18:00,855 --> 00:18:02,154
That might cheer you up.

367
00:18:02,166 --> 00:18:04,102
- I don't want to go out.
- Come on, you have to eat.

368
00:18:04,117 --> 00:18:05,866
You want me to pick something up
for you?

369
00:18:06,238 --> 00:18:06,967
Fine.

370
00:18:06,969 --> 00:18:08,435
Great, great, uh,
oh, so listen, uh...

371
00:18:08,437 --> 00:18:10,308
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

372
00:18:10,330 --> 00:18:11,972
Oh, uh, would you mind
if I take your car?

373
00:18:11,974 --> 00:18:13,056
- Mine's...
- Out of gas.

374
00:18:13,058 --> 00:18:14,591
Sure.

375
00:18:16,845 --> 00:18:18,094
Berta's right.

376
00:18:18,096 --> 00:18:19,929
I am the master.

377
00:18:25,089 --> 00:18:26,589
Oh, boy,

378
00:18:26,615 --> 00:18:28,815
a radio and brakes.

379
00:18:34,185 --> 00:18:35,876
Oh, yeah.

380
00:18:35,896 --> 00:18:38,704
I could get used to this.

381
00:18:41,903 --> 00:18:44,977
Not the face!
Not the face!

382
00:18:53,062 --> 00:18:54,813
I've made a decision.

383
00:18:54,861 --> 00:18:56,544
What's that?

384
00:18:56,564 --> 00:18:59,612
I'm never going to care
about another human being.

385
00:18:59,653 --> 00:19:01,453
Ouch.

386
00:19:01,808 --> 00:19:04,284
- Except you.
- That's better.

387
00:19:04,428 --> 00:19:07,262
I can't believe
I lost Zoey again.

388
00:19:07,332 --> 00:19:10,366
I can't believe I lost
the tip of my pinky to a ferret.

389
00:19:11,061 --> 00:19:13,866
Boo-hoo. I have half a nipple.

390
00:19:14,832 --> 00:19:16,924
All right.

391
00:19:17,061 --> 00:19:19,113
Good night, Alan.

392
00:19:19,157 --> 00:19:21,357
Good night, Walden.

393
00:19:27,645 --> 00:19:29,413
Good night, Rose.

394
00:19:29,444 --> 00:19:31,443
Good night, Alan.
