what you used to wipe.

Well, did you knock on the door

7
00:00:14,031 --> 00:00:15,530
to see if Walden and Berta
were home?

8
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:18,087

She's eating a bagel.

00:02:25,977 --> 00:02:26,980
Where-where's Lyndsey?

59
00:02:26,996 --> 00:02:28,358

the night.

63
00:02:32,501 --> 00:02:35,469

to figure that out?

I don't know what happened.

65
00:02:37,915 --> 00:02:39,397

66
00:02:39,412 --> 00:02:40,940

lasted an hour at a time.

69
00:02:46,947 --> 00:02:49,410
An hour and a half
if he was drunk.

70
00:02:49,878 --> 00:02:50,927
Exactly.

71
00:02:50,973 --> 00:02:53,285
He treated women
like rental cars.

72
00:02:53,339 --> 00:02:55,005

when you need them,

73
00:02:55,007 --> 00:02:56,415

74
00:02:56,449 --> 00:02:59,617
to empty out the trunk
and hose them down.

75
00:03:00,747 --> 00:03:02,965
Well, I'm not paying for sex.

76
00:03:03,399 --> 00:03:05,116
And he can't afford to.

to have your heart broken
by someone you love

113
00:04:20,593 --> 00:04:24,059

151
00:05:53,068 --> 00:05:54,855
a bit of a rough patch
ourselves.

152
00:05:54,879 --> 00:05:57,739
So, she sewed you up in your
sheets while you were sleeping

153
00:05:57,763 --> 00:05:59,687
and started beating you
with a broom?

154
00:05:59,734 --> 00:06:01,175
Uh, no.

155
00:06:01,226 --> 00:06:03,059
Then it's not a rough patch.

156
00:06:04,617 --> 00:06:07,781

relationships so difficult?

157
00:06:07,833 --> 00:06:08,916

Women.

158
00:06:09,292 --> 00:06:10,524
Exactly.

159
00:06:10,561 --> 00:06:12,661
I mean, when was the last time
you were dating someone

160
00:06:12,701 --> 00:06:16,463
and you decided to ask
"Where is this relationship going?"

161
00:06:16,502 --> 00:06:18,669
Or "Are you mad at me?"

162
00:06:18,696 --> 00:06:21,613
Yeah, or "What's all this
glittery, sparkly stuff

163
00:06:21,648 --> 00:06:23,431
on your pants?"

164
00:06:25,234 --> 00:06:27,464
Guys ask questions
that you can answer.

165
00:06:27,482 --> 00:06:29,553

the other night?

Are you mad at me?

214
00:08:21,822 --> 00:08:24,172
No, we just have different ideas

215
00:08:24,189 --> 00:08:25,668
of what a relationship
should be.

00:08:25,677 --> 00:08:27,810

Mm-hmm.

355
00:13:27,858 --> 00:13:29,100
I'll see what I can do.

356
00:13:29,141 --> 00:13:31,329
Oh, not you.
Pretty boy here.

357
00:13:31,375 --> 00:13:33,926
Well, I am more
than just a pretty face.

358
00:13:33,966 --> 00:13:37,322
Come on, man. You can be
like the-the great white shark,

359
00:13:37,363 --> 00:13:39,280
and we'll be
the plucky little pilot fish

360
00:13:39,316 --> 00:13:41,433
who swim alongside you
and feed off your scraps.

361
00:13:42,414 --> 00:13:44,655
Why do I have to be cursed
with all of this?

362
00:13:44,679 --> 00:13:46,450
Back off.

363
00:13:46,542 --> 00:13:48,660
I will seal the deal.

364
00:13:50,361 --> 00:13:52,089
I've seen this movie before.

365
00:13:52,301 --> 00:13:53,615
You're going to enjoy it.

366
00:13:53,893 --> 00:13:55,109
(clearing throat)

367
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:57,045
Hi. I hate to interrupt,

368
00:13:57,075 --> 00:13:59,068
so I'm just gonna cut
right to the chase.

369
00:13:59,101 --> 00:14:02,557
I'm neither tall, nor handsome,
but I'm incredibly rich.

370
00:14:02,679 --> 00:14:06,097
So which of you
would like the honor

371
00:14:06,125 --> 00:14:10,711
of sleeping with me
for... $5,000?

372
00:14:14,558 --> 00:14:15,903
I apologize.

373
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:18,511
Ten thousand.

374
00:14:18,527 --> 00:14:20,043
(scoffs)

375
00:14:25,733 --> 00:14:26,661
(clears throat)

376
00:14:30,167 --> 00:14:31,557
Gentlemen,

377
00:14:31,589 --> 00:14:33,948
the bar has been lowered.

378
00:14:38,318 --> 00:14:40,017
This is a great idea, Herb.

379
00:14:40,041 --> 00:14:42,027
Yeah, but we shouldn't
call him Herb.

380
00:14:42,058 --> 00:14:43,624
We should call him Erb.

381
00:14:44,034 --> 00:14:45,867
(laughing)

382
00:14:45,895 --> 00:14:47,198
Well, as a doctor,

383
00:14:47,218 --> 00:14:49,885
I have access to some
pretty righteous chronic.

384
00:14:50,024 --> 00:14:51,587
You're a pediatrician.

385
00:14:51,608 --> 00:14:53,157
I prescribe it to the parents.

386
00:14:53,233 --> 00:14:54,434
BILLY:
Hmm.

387
00:14:54,621 --> 00:14:55,770
This would be way better

388
00:14:55,792 --> 00:14:57,475
if there were four
hot women in here.

389
00:14:57,496 --> 00:14:59,479
Yeah, and none of you.

390
00:14:59,812 --> 00:15:02,206
Please, the only way
you could satisfy four women

391
00:15:02,241 --> 00:15:04,196
is if they were cannibals.

392
00:15:04,373 --> 00:15:06,206
(laughing)
Okay.

393
00:15:06,230 --> 00:15:07,744
Yeah. Look,
I will have you know,

394
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:10,022
I have no trouble satisfying
multiple women.

395
00:15:10,053 --> 00:15:11,777
In fact,
that's kind of the reason

396
00:15:11,814 --> 00:15:14,364
I ended in this big bowl
of sausage soup.

397
00:15:14,877 --> 00:15:16,172
What do you mean?

398
00:15:16,249 --> 00:15:20,251
Bridget and I would enjoy
the occasional threesome.

399
00:15:20,315 --> 00:15:23,355
And by "occasional,"
I mean every Friday, Saturday,

400
00:15:23,377 --> 00:15:24,774
and Sunday night.

401
00:15:24,821 --> 00:15:27,120
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Bridget, like, my Bridget?

402
00:15:27,146 --> 00:15:29,379
Yup. She was a weekend warrior.

403
00:15:29,625 --> 00:15:32,824
Wow. The closest we ever
came to a threesome

404
00:15:32,856 --> 00:15:36,391
was one time we dog-sat, and I
left the bedroom door open.

405
00:15:36,437 --> 00:15:38,187
Me and that beagle
made eye contact

406
00:15:38,225 --> 00:15:40,358
at the most inopportune moment.

407
00:15:40,827 --> 00:15:42,743
(laughing):
Oh, my God.

408
00:15:42,787 --> 00:15:45,054
Well, hey, hey, hey—
one word of advice.

409
00:15:45,086 --> 00:15:47,880
Do not look up
from the lap of a girl

410
00:15:47,906 --> 00:15:50,642
you just picked up at Safeway
and say to your girlfriend,

411
00:15:50,673 --> 00:15:53,758
"My God, I never
want this to end!"

412
00:15:54,343 --> 00:15:56,360
Aah, threesomes never work out.

413
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:58,066
Somebody always feels left out.

414
00:15:58,092 --> 00:16:01,059
That's why my receptionist and I
got another couple and swing.

415
00:16:01,121 --> 00:16:04,299
(laughing): Ooh! Stringbean's a freak.
I like it.

416
00:16:04,336 --> 00:16:06,278
Yeah, if you and, uh,
Bridget ever get back together,

417
00:16:06,311 --> 00:16:08,480
maybe she'd like
to become a Herbivore.

418
00:16:10,635 --> 00:16:12,636
I will keep that in mind.

419
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:15,494
Okay, so I lied

420
00:16:15,529 --> 00:16:17,359
to the woman I love
about who I am.

421
00:16:17,387 --> 00:16:18,669
Herb cheated on his wife.

422
00:16:18,697 --> 00:16:19,963
And Billy spent
too much time

423
00:16:19,990 --> 00:16:21,767
yodeling in
the wrong canyon.

424
00:16:24,264 --> 00:16:26,040
Why did you and Lyndsey
break up?

425
00:16:26,085 --> 00:16:28,236
She wanted a key to the house.

426
00:16:31,981 --> 00:16:32,981
And?

427
00:16:33,212 --> 00:16:35,160
And I said no.

428
00:16:35,614 --> 00:16:36,864
Why?

429
00:16:37,477 --> 00:16:39,010
Well, it's-it's not mine
to give.

430
00:16:39,028 --> 00:16:40,403
It's your house.

431
00:16:40,441 --> 00:16:42,350
Since when does that
matter to you?

432
00:16:42,833 --> 00:16:44,596
Since I don't want my girlfriend

433
00:16:44,629 --> 00:16:46,683
to have unrestricted access
to my house.

434
00:16:46,705 --> 00:16:48,717
And we're back to your house.

435
00:16:49,630 --> 00:16:51,129
I like my space!

436
00:16:51,149 --> 00:16:52,698
I-I want to keep
my options open.

437
00:16:52,735 --> 00:16:55,809
Options? You have op-shun.

438
00:16:56,594 --> 00:17:00,812
Shun. As in,
all other girls shun you.

439
00:17:01,204 --> 00:17:02,310
BILLY:
Look, Alan,

440
00:17:02,332 --> 00:17:03,294
don't be a schmuck.

441
00:17:03,313 --> 00:17:05,096
If you're gonna throw away
your relationship,

442
00:17:05,118 --> 00:17:06,313
do it for a good reason.

443
00:17:06,354 --> 00:17:09,989
Like spending too much time
face down in the checkout girl.

444
00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:12,286
Yeah, or, uh, fooling around

445
00:17:12,310 --> 00:17:13,785
with your hot,
young receptionist

446
00:17:13,813 --> 00:17:16,915
who lets you wear a diaper while
riding her around the office.

447
00:17:19,571 --> 00:17:21,413
Is one example.

448
00:17:21,916 --> 00:17:24,750
Nobody's gonna think about that
next time we see you.

449
00:17:25,458 --> 00:17:27,971
My point is,
you're the only one of us

450
00:17:28,001 --> 00:17:29,715
who has a chance
to get his girl back.

451
00:17:29,731 --> 00:17:31,812
What about all that stuff
about not needing women?

452
00:17:31,834 --> 00:17:34,418
We only said that
because we don't have women.

453
00:17:34,441 --> 00:17:36,873
Really?
Of course. Lyndsey is awesome.

454
00:17:36,909 --> 00:17:39,363
She really is.
She's got the face of an angel,

455
00:17:39,399 --> 00:17:41,649
buttocks you can bounce
a quarter off,

456
00:17:41,671 --> 00:17:44,286
and a bosom that just makes you
wish she was your mother.

457
00:17:46,679 --> 00:17:48,296
But I'm saying she's awesome.

458
00:17:48,772 --> 00:17:51,809
Just give her the key, Alan.
Give her anything she wants.

459
00:17:51,838 --> 00:17:53,755
Well, it's a little late.
She's out with another guy.

460
00:17:53,774 --> 00:17:55,130
Well, no, it's not too late.

461
00:17:55,143 --> 00:17:57,861
Go get her.
Go do it for yourself.

462
00:17:57,897 --> 00:17:59,915
Do it for all of us
who can't get our girl back.

463
00:17:59,937 --> 00:18:01,153
Yeah!
Come on, go get her.

464
00:18:01,167 --> 00:18:02,784
Okay, okay, you're right.
Yeah.

465
00:18:02,808 --> 00:18:03,966
You're right.
I'm gonna do it!

466
00:18:03,991 --> 00:18:06,218
I'm gonna do it for all of us!
There you go.

467
00:18:06,309 --> 00:18:07,442
Oh.

468
00:18:07,669 --> 00:18:09,420

469
00:18:14,230 --> 00:18:16,981

he is our only hope.

00:18:33,604 --> 00:18:34,886
I-I just need two minutes.

00:18:34,901 --> 00:18:36,368

Alan, this is not a good time.

483
00:18:43,201 --> 00:18:44,367
Okay, just-just hear me out,
okay?

484
00:18:44,388 --> 00:18:45,849
Look, she said this
wasn't a good time.

00:18:46,886 --> 00:18:49,169
Whoa, whoa.
Walden, what are you doing?

487
00:18:49,199 --> 00:18:51,237
You'll thank us later.
What are you doing? Put me down.

488
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:53,213
Who are you?
HERB: You look lovely, Lyndsey.

489
00:18:53,243 --> 00:18:54,366
What the hell is going on?

490
00:18:54,384 --> 00:18:56,033
I swear I had nothing
to do with this.

491
00:18:56,068 --> 00:18:57,785
Why did they just take
my date away?

492
00:18:57,804 --> 00:18:59,761
Don't worry. I think
they're just trying to help.

493
00:18:59,801 --> 00:19:01,134
Help with what?

494
00:19:01,175 --> 00:19:03,278
Okay, I-I know this seems crazy,

495
00:19:03,327 --> 00:19:06,908
but I've been doing
a lot of thinking and... here.

496
00:19:07,375 --> 00:19:08,849
What's this?

497
00:19:08,879 --> 00:19:10,262
A key to the house.

498
00:19:10,290 --> 00:19:11,806
I want you to have it.

499
00:19:12,188 --> 00:19:12,752
Really?

500
00:19:12,764 --> 00:19:14,314
Yes, yes,
you're my girlfriend.

501
00:19:14,342 --> 00:19:16,865
Mi casa es su casa.

502
00:19:16,902 --> 00:19:17,580
Actually,

503
00:19:17,596 --> 00:19:19,563
mi casa es Walden's casa

504
00:19:19,581 --> 00:19:20,980
es su casa.

505
00:19:21,491 --> 00:19:24,073
I think I went to high school
with a Sue Casa.

506
00:19:24,210 --> 00:19:26,610
Which is ironic,
because she ended up homeless.

507
00:19:26,662 --> 00:19:27,353
Sorry.

508
00:19:27,379 --> 00:19:28,595
Anyway, the point is,

509
00:19:28,630 --> 00:19:30,663
the key is yours.

510
00:19:31,163 --> 00:19:32,386
What made you change your mind?

511
00:19:32,404 --> 00:19:34,270
I love you, Lyndsey.

512
00:19:34,459 --> 00:19:36,927
What really made you
change your mind?

513
00:19:36,946 --> 00:19:38,946
All right, here we go.

514
00:19:39,145 --> 00:19:42,946
The fact that while you could
certainly do better,

515
00:19:42,983 --> 00:19:45,115
there's no way I ever could.

516
00:19:45,214 --> 00:19:47,714

517
00:19:47,847 --> 00:19:49,594
And so true.

518
00:19:50,877 --> 00:19:53,161
So I know Herb and Walden,

519
00:19:53,215 --> 00:19:55,677

in the bathrobe?

00:20:15,552 --> 00:20:17,574
Oh, please, call me Steven.

531
00:20:17,602 --> 00:20:19,385
Well, Steven Staven?

532
00:20:20,093 --> 00:20:22,000
It's made me
a stronger person.

533
00:20:22,263 --> 00:20:24,801
You know, you wear that robe
better than Judith ever did.

534
00:20:24,837 --> 00:20:26,835
Really? I feel boxy.

535
00:20:26,886 --> 00:20:28,785
No, no.
(dog barks)

536
00:20:29,021 --> 00:20:30,287
What was that?

537
00:20:30,355 --> 00:20:31,077
(growling)

538
00:20:31,262 --> 00:20:32,375
WALDEN:
Uh-oh.

539
00:20:33,855 --> 00:20:34,855
Oh, crap.

540
00:20:34,899 --> 00:20:36,262
Run, Steven Staven!

541
00:20:36,325 --> 00:20:37,304
Run!

542
00:20:37,318 --> 00:20:38,901
Oh, wait!

543
00:20:38,953 --> 00:20:40,035
Herb's down!

544
00:20:40,059 --> 00:20:41,259
Leave him!

545
00:20:41,565 --> 00:20:43,016
Oh, dear God,
help me!

546
00:20:44,087 --> 00:20:45,706
Tell Lyndsey
I love her!
