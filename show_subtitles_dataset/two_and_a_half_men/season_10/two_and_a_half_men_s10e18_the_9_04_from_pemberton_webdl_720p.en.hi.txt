1
00:00:04,516 --> 00:00:08,920
Hey lyndsey,
just calling to say good night.

2
00:00:08,922 --> 00:00:11,256
Oh, oh,
you're in bed already?

3
00:00:11,258 --> 00:00:15,627
So, uh,
what are you wearing?

4
00:00:15,629 --> 00:00:16,828
Really?

5
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:18,229
What kind of sweat pants?

6
00:00:19,598 --> 00:00:23,501
Ooh,
big, old gray ones.

7
00:00:23,503 --> 00:00:27,138
Is it just me or are you
getting turned on, too?

8
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:30,208
It's... J-j-just me?

9
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:31,142
Well, that's fine.

10
00:00:31,144 --> 00:00:33,845
I do some of my best work alone.

11
00:00:33,847 --> 00:00:36,080
All right, all right,
go to sleep.

12
00:00:36,082 --> 00:00:37,115
I love you.

13
00:00:37,117 --> 00:00:38,249
Do you love...?

14
00:00:39,952 --> 00:00:41,519
I know she does.

15
00:00:45,491 --> 00:00:46,791
Oh, great.

16
00:00:46,793 --> 00:00:47,692
(sighs)

17
00:00:50,496 --> 00:00:52,230
(screams)

18
00:00:54,867 --> 00:00:56,301
Uh-oh, uh...

19
00:00:56,303 --> 00:00:58,403
(sighs)

20
00:01:00,673 --> 00:01:01,673
Oh!

21
00:01:01,675 --> 00:01:03,975
Oh, no, no, no.

22
00:01:03,977 --> 00:01:06,010
No, I can't burn down
another house.

23
00:01:10,282 --> 00:01:13,751

24
00:01:45,986 --> 00:01:49,354

00:02:14,747 --> 00:02:15,813
Morning.

30
00:02:15,815 --> 00:02:17,048
Hey.

31
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:19,150
Sorry again about last night.
(awkward laugh)

32
00:02:19,152 --> 00:02:20,451
Sorry about what?

33
00:02:20,453 --> 00:02:22,553
The fact that
my date and I came home

34
00:02:22,555 --> 00:02:24,389
Last night to find
a middle-aged man

35
00:02:24,391 --> 00:02:26,791
Spraying water
all over my kitchen

36
00:02:26,793 --> 00:02:29,660
In his tighty
not-so-whities?

37
00:02:29,662 --> 00:02:32,397
I was putting out a fire.

38
00:02:32,399 --> 00:02:34,465
I'm a hero.

39
00:02:34,467 --> 00:02:35,767
Really?

40
00:02:35,769 --> 00:02:37,468
'cause it looked like you were
posing for

41
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:39,437
The world's most disturbing
firemen calendar.

42
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:42,540
Okay, okay, I get it.

43
00:02:42,542 --> 00:02:44,075
You're a little upset.

44
00:02:44,077 --> 00:02:47,178
But I have something that will
make you feel better.

45
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:48,913
♪ ta-da.

46
00:02:48,915 --> 00:02:50,915
I went out to the drugstore

47
00:02:50,917 --> 00:02:53,151
And bought you a new toaster
to replace the old one.

48
00:02:55,954 --> 00:02:57,789
The other one was better.

49
00:02:58,357 --> 00:03:00,091
Better?

50
00:03:00,093 --> 00:03:02,326
This is the toastblaster deluxe.

51
00:03:02,328 --> 00:03:05,363
This is the best thing to happen
to sliced bread since...

52
00:03:05,365 --> 00:03:07,065
Sliced bread.

53
00:03:07,067 --> 00:03:09,567
But mine had glass walls,

54
00:03:09,569 --> 00:03:11,803
So you could watch the
toast turn tropical brown.

55
00:03:11,805 --> 00:03:14,272
It was like a... Little...

56
00:03:14,274 --> 00:03:16,741
Bread tanning booth.

57
00:03:18,877 --> 00:03:20,178
Well, check this out, you know.

58
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:21,913
Light, dark.

59
00:03:21,915 --> 00:03:23,548
Dark...

60
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:25,783
Light.

61
00:03:25,785 --> 00:03:29,187
Okay, that's, uh...

62
00:03:29,189 --> 00:03:30,555
That-that's supposed to happen.

63
00:03:30,557 --> 00:03:32,356
That's ac— that's actually
a safety feature.

64
00:03:32,358 --> 00:03:34,258
You know,
common courtesy dictates

65
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:36,260
That if you're
gonna use my stuff

66
00:03:36,262 --> 00:03:37,595
And break my stuff,

67
00:03:37,597 --> 00:03:38,796
That you replace my stuff

68
00:03:38,798 --> 00:03:41,065
With equally awesome stuff.

69
00:03:41,067 --> 00:03:43,568
This-this-this
is what would happen

70
00:03:43,570 --> 00:03:46,104
If my toaster took a crap.

71
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:49,407
What are you talking about?

72
00:03:49,409 --> 00:03:51,142
This is a
perfectly good toaster.

73
00:03:51,144 --> 00:03:53,478
Look, okay, you know what?
I'll prove it to you.

74
00:03:57,149 --> 00:03:58,850
Hope you're hungry.

75
00:03:58,852 --> 00:04:01,786
(loud buzzing)

76
00:04:03,021 --> 00:04:07,325
(loudly):
Listen to that baby purr!

77
00:04:07,327 --> 00:04:10,261
(loudly):
I hate you.

78
00:04:15,033 --> 00:04:17,034
Berta:
By the way,

79
00:04:17,036 --> 00:04:18,035
In case I forget.

80
00:04:18,037 --> 00:04:19,971
I might be a little
late on Monday.

81
00:04:19,973 --> 00:04:20,972
Oh, no problem.

82
00:04:20,974 --> 00:04:22,273
When should
I expect you?

83
00:04:22,275 --> 00:04:25,176
Wednesday.

84
00:04:25,178 --> 00:04:27,745
Should I dock you
for the time you miss?

85
00:04:27,747 --> 00:04:29,580
I wouldn't.

86
00:04:31,884 --> 00:04:33,851
(sighs)

87
00:04:41,093 --> 00:04:42,093
Here you go.

88
00:04:42,095 --> 00:04:43,694
What's this?

89
00:04:43,696 --> 00:04:45,663
I went to the store
and I asked them,

90
00:04:45,665 --> 00:04:47,398
"what is the
stupidest thing I can buy?"

91
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:48,666
And they
gave me this toaster.

92
00:04:48,668 --> 00:04:49,834
Enjoy.

93
00:04:49,836 --> 00:04:51,936
You know,
you didn't have to do that.

94
00:04:51,938 --> 00:04:53,838
Ah, you made it pretty clear
that I did.

95
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:57,175
In fact, I forwent replacing
my cell phone to buy this.

96
00:04:57,177 --> 00:04:59,277
"forwent"?

97
00:04:59,279 --> 00:05:01,913
It's a word.

98
00:05:01,915 --> 00:05:03,047
Well, I appreciate it.

99
00:05:03,049 --> 00:05:04,482
Thank you.

100
00:05:04,484 --> 00:05:07,051
Uh, and you don't have to worry
about me ruining that one,

101
00:05:07,053 --> 00:05:08,452
Because
I will never use it.

102
00:05:08,454 --> 00:05:10,021
Okay, stop being ridiculous.

103
00:05:10,023 --> 00:05:11,088
(scoffing)

104
00:05:11,090 --> 00:05:12,557
You want to know what's
ridiculous?

105
00:05:12,559 --> 00:05:14,058
A glass toaster.

106
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:14,859
What's next?

107
00:05:14,861 --> 00:05:15,927
A glass toilet,

108
00:05:15,929 --> 00:05:18,362
So you can wave good-bye
to the toast?

109
00:05:22,367 --> 00:05:24,569
How about a glass front door

110
00:05:24,571 --> 00:05:26,370
So I can wave good-bye to you?

111
00:05:26,372 --> 00:05:29,373
Oh, please!
You would be lost without me.

112
00:05:29,375 --> 00:05:32,643
I would be
lost without you?
Yeah.

113
00:05:32,645 --> 00:05:36,847
Okay, the only thing that you've
brought into my life

114
00:05:36,849 --> 00:05:38,983
Is an oil-leaking volvo,

115
00:05:38,985 --> 00:05:41,519
A musty smell in
my guest room

116
00:05:41,521 --> 00:05:43,454
And the word "forwent."

117
00:05:43,456 --> 00:05:45,623
It is the past tense
of "forgo."

118
00:05:45,625 --> 00:05:46,991
Edify yourself, sir.

119
00:05:48,227 --> 00:05:50,294
And have you noticed

120
00:05:50,296 --> 00:05:52,430
That all the people in your life
come and go,

121
00:05:52,432 --> 00:05:53,764
But I am the one constant?

122
00:05:53,766 --> 00:05:54,799
I am always here.

123
00:05:54,801 --> 00:05:56,434
Maybe the reason
they come and go

124
00:05:56,436 --> 00:05:58,970
Is because you are always here.

125
00:05:58,972 --> 00:06:00,871
When a woman dumps you,
who picks up the pieces?

126
00:06:00,873 --> 00:06:01,872
Alan harper.

127
00:06:01,874 --> 00:06:03,441
And who picks up the check?

128
00:06:03,443 --> 00:06:04,542
Walden schmidt.

129
00:06:04,544 --> 00:06:05,943
(scoffs)
of course, of course.

130
00:06:05,945 --> 00:06:07,144
Pull out the money card.

131
00:06:07,146 --> 00:06:08,746
They're called credit cards.

132
00:06:08,748 --> 00:06:10,581
Edify yourself, sir.

133
00:06:10,583 --> 00:06:12,049
Okay, if-if-if
this is how you think,

134
00:06:12,051 --> 00:06:13,884
Then I don't even know why
I'm living here.

135
00:06:13,886 --> 00:06:16,420
Oh, I do: Because it's free!

136
00:06:16,422 --> 00:06:17,888
Okay, okay, maybe I should go.

137
00:06:17,890 --> 00:06:18,889
Maybe you should.

138
00:06:18,891 --> 00:06:19,724
Fine.
Fine.

139
00:06:19,726 --> 00:06:21,826
Okay.
Okay.

140
00:06:21,828 --> 00:06:22,927
I am not bluffing.

141
00:06:22,929 --> 00:06:24,061
Me neither.

142
00:06:24,063 --> 00:06:26,264
This is me
opening the door.

143
00:06:26,266 --> 00:06:28,132
This is me watching.

144
00:06:28,134 --> 00:06:29,433
This is me leaving forever.

145
00:06:29,435 --> 00:06:32,169
This is me waving good-bye.

146
00:06:35,207 --> 00:06:38,009
And this is me homeless.

147
00:06:38,011 --> 00:06:39,910
♪ men... ♪

148
00:06:39,912 --> 00:06:41,345
You know what the problem is?

149
00:06:41,347 --> 00:06:43,447
Walden doesn't appreciate what
I bring to the party.

150
00:06:43,449 --> 00:06:46,083
I've never seen you bring
anything to a party.

151
00:06:46,085 --> 00:06:48,753
Except a ziplock bag
to steal the shrimp.

152
00:06:48,755 --> 00:06:50,087
Whose side are you on?

153
00:06:50,089 --> 00:06:51,622
Yours, of course.

154
00:06:51,624 --> 00:06:53,391
Listen, I know you're upset,

155
00:06:53,393 --> 00:06:55,660
But I'm sure you two
lovebirds will kiss and make up.

156
00:06:55,662 --> 00:06:56,961
No, not happening.

157
00:06:56,963 --> 00:06:59,030
He does not want me back,
and I'm not going back.

158
00:06:59,032 --> 00:06:59,830
You're not?
No.

159
00:06:59,832 --> 00:07:01,565
I have my self-respect.

160
00:07:02,534 --> 00:07:04,168
I do.

161
00:07:04,170 --> 00:07:06,003
So where are you gonna live?

162
00:07:06,005 --> 00:07:08,005
(chuckling): Where am I
going to live? You're cute.

163
00:07:08,007 --> 00:07:09,407
(chuckling):
Thanks.

164
00:07:09,409 --> 00:07:10,508
So where are
you gonna live?

165
00:07:10,510 --> 00:07:12,009
Seriously?

166
00:07:12,011 --> 00:07:14,078
Alan, I want
to live with you.

167
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,246
But when you move in,

168
00:07:15,248 --> 00:07:16,647
I want it to be
because I'm your first choice,

169
00:07:16,649 --> 00:07:18,049
Not your last resort.

170
00:07:18,051 --> 00:07:20,451
You are my
first choice.
I'm your only choice.

171
00:07:20,453 --> 00:07:23,087
My one and only choice.

172
00:07:23,089 --> 00:07:25,056
Until walden asks
you to move back.

173
00:07:25,058 --> 00:07:26,457
Oh, please!

174
00:07:26,459 --> 00:07:28,726
I-I am offended that you could
even suggest such a thing.

175
00:07:28,728 --> 00:07:30,061
You are the woman I love;

176
00:07:30,063 --> 00:07:32,530
The woman I want to spend
the rest of my life with.

177
00:07:32,532 --> 00:07:34,832
Aw... You're right, sweetie.

178
00:07:34,834 --> 00:07:37,902
I'm sorry. You can move in.
Oh, thank you.

179
00:07:37,904 --> 00:07:40,338
It'll be nice to
share the place with you.
Yeah, it's gonna be great.

180
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:42,239
And we can split all the bills
right down the middle.

181
00:07:42,241 --> 00:07:43,341
Ah...

182
00:07:44,476 --> 00:07:47,645
Oh, come on,
you don't want my money.

183
00:07:47,647 --> 00:07:49,447
You're an
independent woman.

184
00:07:49,449 --> 00:07:51,148
Walk proud.

185
00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:55,353
Walk over
to this door and let me back in.

186
00:07:55,355 --> 00:07:56,887
Herb:
Hey, alan.

187
00:07:56,889 --> 00:08:00,825
Oh, god! Herb!

188
00:08:00,827 --> 00:08:01,859
What-what are you doing?

189
00:08:01,861 --> 00:08:02,993
Neighborhood watch.

190
00:08:02,995 --> 00:08:04,128
Oh, that's nice.

191
00:08:04,130 --> 00:08:05,196
I-I didn't even know
there was one.

192
00:08:05,198 --> 00:08:06,564
There isn't.

193
00:08:06,566 --> 00:08:08,699
So, uh, you and
lyndsey have a little tiff?

194
00:08:08,701 --> 00:08:13,037
Oh, uh, not really a tiff,
as much as, uh...

195
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:14,972
Hey, are you
still rattling around

196
00:08:14,974 --> 00:08:16,674
In that big old
house all by yourself?

197
00:08:16,676 --> 00:08:18,909
Yeah, I don't think judith's
ever coming back.

198
00:08:18,911 --> 00:08:20,711
That's terrific...

199
00:08:20,713 --> 00:08:23,114
Ly sad.

200
00:08:23,116 --> 00:08:24,515
You know what?

201
00:08:24,517 --> 00:08:26,717
At a time like this, you-you
should not be alone.

202
00:08:26,719 --> 00:08:28,986
Let's go over to your place
and have a few beers.

203
00:08:28,988 --> 00:08:30,755
You're a good friend, alan.

204
00:08:30,757 --> 00:08:32,423
What can I say?
I'm a giver.

205
00:08:32,425 --> 00:08:35,659
Say, do you still have
the hide-a-bed in the den?

206
00:08:35,661 --> 00:08:37,661
♪ men... ♪

207
00:08:37,663 --> 00:08:42,366
All right, I packed up
all zippy's stuff.

208
00:08:42,368 --> 00:08:44,201
It's sad.

209
00:08:44,203 --> 00:08:48,506
His entire life
fits into one duffel bag.

210
00:08:48,508 --> 00:08:51,876
What's even sadder
is it's my duffel bag.

211
00:08:51,878 --> 00:08:54,278
He's coming back;
you know that, right?

212
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:55,446
No, he's not.

213
00:08:55,448 --> 00:08:57,481
He is a human boomerang.

214
00:08:57,483 --> 00:09:00,351
He's going to circle around,
break a window,

215
00:09:00,353 --> 00:09:02,987
And land right on your couch.

216
00:09:02,989 --> 00:09:05,523
(doorbell rings)

217
00:09:12,464 --> 00:09:13,831
Open a window
in the kitchen,

218
00:09:13,833 --> 00:09:15,533
Maybe he'll just
go straight through.

219
00:09:19,271 --> 00:09:20,271
Alan.

220
00:09:20,273 --> 00:09:21,705
Walden.

221
00:09:21,707 --> 00:09:24,074
Don't worry, I'm just here
to pick up my things

222
00:09:24,076 --> 00:09:25,276
And then I'll be on my way.

223
00:09:25,278 --> 00:09:27,211
Where you heading,
zippy, back to mommy's?

224
00:09:27,213 --> 00:09:28,979
Living with my mother—

225
00:09:28,981 --> 00:09:30,748
That's pretty pathetic,
isn't it?

226
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:32,583
No, for your information,

227
00:09:32,585 --> 00:09:34,151
I am living
with my ex-wife's ex-husband

228
00:09:34,153 --> 00:09:37,822
At my ex-house.

229
00:09:37,824 --> 00:09:39,957
Yeah, that's not pathetic.

230
00:09:39,959 --> 00:09:42,393
I packed your things for you.
(clears throat)

231
00:09:42,395 --> 00:09:43,828
Oh.

232
00:09:43,830 --> 00:09:45,796
I presume this is everything?

233
00:09:45,798 --> 00:09:47,398
You presume correct.
Hmm.

234
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:49,033
Your clothes,
your toaster

235
00:09:49,035 --> 00:09:51,368
And your expired
mexican boner pills.

236
00:09:56,541 --> 00:09:58,943
Is it lonely up there, walden?

237
00:10:00,345 --> 00:10:04,181
Is it lonely
on your cloud of judgment?

238
00:10:04,183 --> 00:10:07,051
I don't know, maybe you could
leave, so I could find out.

239
00:10:07,053 --> 00:10:09,587
All right,
then, good-bye.

240
00:10:11,356 --> 00:10:13,324
Berta, are you crying?

241
00:10:13,326 --> 00:10:15,626
(crying):
I can't help it.

242
00:10:15,628 --> 00:10:17,795
I'm just so damn happy.

243
00:10:18,763 --> 00:10:21,232
♪ men... ♪

244
00:10:23,034 --> 00:10:24,435
♪ men... ♪

245
00:10:24,437 --> 00:10:26,470
Here you go.

246
00:10:26,472 --> 00:10:29,607
Two eggs over easy,
silver dollar pancakes,

247
00:10:29,609 --> 00:10:33,811
Apple wood smoked bacon
and whole grain toast.

248
00:10:33,813 --> 00:10:36,247
(chuckling):
This is delightful, alan.

249
00:10:36,249 --> 00:10:38,415
You really know
how to spoil your man.

250
00:10:37,687 --> 00:10:39,154
Andy! Right here, I'm open!

251
00:10:39,188 --> 00:10:42,123
- Whoo!
- Dad, go long!

252
00:10:39,851 --> 00:10:41,485
And you know
how to flatter yours.

253
00:10:42,621 --> 00:10:44,622
Wow, it seems
like just yesterday

254
00:10:44,624 --> 00:10:46,257
I was living
here with judith.

255
00:10:45,027 --> 00:10:47,120
- Yeah.
- Again!

256
00:10:46,259 --> 00:10:47,424
Only difference now is,

257
00:10:47,163 --> 00:10:49,791
- Well done, son!
- Way to go, S.H.

258
00:10:47,426 --> 00:10:49,593
I actually have a
chance at getting laid.

259
00:10:49,595 --> 00:10:52,296
Well, if dinner's
as good as breakfast,

260
00:10:49,832 --> 00:10:50,924
Thanks, Kev.

261
00:10:52,298 --> 00:10:53,697
You've got
more than a chance.

262
00:10:53,699 --> 00:10:55,399
(laughing)

263
00:10:55,401 --> 00:10:56,400
Seriously,
I-I really appreciate

264
00:10:55,538 --> 00:10:58,905
- I'm sick of neighborhood watch.
- I'm bored.

265
00:10:56,402 --> 00:10:57,668
You letting
me stay here.

266
00:10:57,670 --> 00:10:59,537
Ah, well, it's nice to
have someone around again.

267
00:10:58,941 --> 00:11:01,341
- Yeah, I'm bored, too. Let's go home.
- Yeah.

268
00:10:59,539 --> 00:11:01,672
It's been a little
lonely since judith left.

269
00:11:01,377 --> 00:11:04,346
Hey, I wanna cut off some of my hair and
see what you'd look like with a goatee.

270
00:11:01,674 --> 00:11:03,674
I found it lonely
even when judith was here.

271
00:11:03,676 --> 00:11:06,277
Mm... Yeah, I've
been watching tv alone

272
00:11:05,181 --> 00:11:07,081
- Yeah.
- No, no. No goatee.

273
00:11:06,279 --> 00:11:08,279
And drinking alone.

274
00:11:07,116 --> 00:11:10,517
Neighborhood watch. I know
what will make this more fun.

275
00:11:08,281 --> 00:11:10,080
I even painted a
moustache on the bathroom mirror

276
00:11:10,082 --> 00:11:11,382
So I'd have
someone to talk to.

277
00:11:11,384 --> 00:11:14,285
R... Really?

278
00:11:12,021 --> 00:11:14,956
- This does make it more fun.
- Yeah.

279
00:11:14,287 --> 00:11:16,887
Yeah. I call him javier.

280
00:11:14,991 --> 00:11:18,722
God, I like Tom wine. You know,
I think his family has a vineyard.

281
00:11:16,889 --> 00:11:19,356
(latin accent):
Don't worry, herb,
you're better off.

282
00:11:18,761 --> 00:11:22,697
Hey, you guys. Tom's family
doesn't have the vineyard.

283
00:11:19,358 --> 00:11:22,560
"yudith," she's a "beetch."

284
00:11:22,562 --> 00:11:25,029
Can't argue with javier.

285
00:11:22,732 --> 00:11:24,666
He is the vineyard.

286
00:11:25,031 --> 00:11:28,098
No, no, I wouldn't—
he's got a fiery latin temper.

287
00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:29,563
We're drinking his feet!

288
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:30,367
And a machete.

289
00:11:30,306 --> 00:11:32,672
Let's pour it out.

290
00:11:34,043 --> 00:11:36,307
- It is pretty good, though.
- Alcohol is sterile.

291
00:11:34,806 --> 00:11:37,074
Um, l-let me ask you something.

292
00:11:36,946 --> 00:11:38,914
- To sweaty foot wine!
- Chin-chin.

293
00:11:38,009 --> 00:11:39,710
Does herb have a machete?

294
00:11:38,948 --> 00:11:40,142
I'm with you.

295
00:11:40,183 --> 00:11:43,118
- Hmm...
- I wonder what else is going on.

296
00:11:43,386 --> 00:11:47,447
Check this out.
I thought Rick and Steve were brothers.

297
00:11:44,883 --> 00:11:46,917
(footsteps approaching)

298
00:11:46,919 --> 00:11:48,118
Morning.

299
00:11:47,490 --> 00:11:52,018
Chad Shultz just opened a beer
during his intervention!

300
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:49,620
Morning.

301
00:11:49,622 --> 00:11:52,289
Hey, berta, knock, knock.

302
00:11:52,061 --> 00:11:54,655
Wow, the Goldsteins' fight
got sexual in a hurry.

303
00:11:52,291 --> 00:11:53,357
Who's there?

304
00:11:53,359 --> 00:11:54,391
Not alan.

305
00:11:54,393 --> 00:11:56,060
(laughing)

306
00:11:54,697 --> 00:11:58,394
I know, it's like, "You're worthless,
I hate you, put a baby inside of me!"

307
00:11:56,062 --> 00:11:58,062
Free at last, walden.

308
00:11:58,064 --> 00:12:00,331
Thank god almighty,
we're free at last.

309
00:11:58,434 --> 00:12:02,734
Neighborhood watch sucked,
but Wine and Spy rocks.

310
00:12:00,333 --> 00:12:03,701
Yeah. Although it is
a little quieter around here.

311
00:12:03,703 --> 00:12:05,669
Get a dog— then it
won't seem so weird

312
00:12:05,671 --> 00:12:07,504
When you catch him
trying to lick himself.

313
00:12:08,707 --> 00:12:10,207
Hey, berta?
Yeah?

314
00:12:10,209 --> 00:12:12,276
What do you think about
turning alan's room

315
00:12:12,278 --> 00:12:13,677
Into a home gym?

316
00:12:13,679 --> 00:12:16,146
Well, I was thinking about
trying to grow pot in there,

317
00:12:16,148 --> 00:12:17,514
But okay.

318
00:12:17,516 --> 00:12:19,183
Hey, berta?

319
00:12:19,185 --> 00:12:20,084
Yeah?

320
00:12:20,086 --> 00:12:22,052
What's going on with you?

321
00:12:22,054 --> 00:12:23,454
What do you mean?

322
00:12:23,456 --> 00:12:25,255
I don't know. Like...

323
00:12:25,257 --> 00:12:27,024
How's your family?

324
00:12:27,026 --> 00:12:29,026
Incarcerated.
(laughs)

325
00:12:29,028 --> 00:12:31,228
That's funny.

326
00:12:31,230 --> 00:12:32,930
Okay. Good talk.

327
00:12:32,932 --> 00:12:34,932
Hey... Berta?

328
00:12:34,934 --> 00:12:36,200
Yeah?

329
00:12:36,202 --> 00:12:37,201
Knock, knock.

330
00:12:37,203 --> 00:12:38,636
Who's there?

331
00:12:38,638 --> 00:12:40,270
It's walden. Let me in.

332
00:12:43,108 --> 00:12:45,309
What are your hopes?
What are your dreams?

333
00:12:45,311 --> 00:12:47,745
I'm just hoping to get
out of this conversation.

334
00:12:47,747 --> 00:12:49,079
(chuckles)

335
00:12:49,081 --> 00:12:50,748
You're... You're
on fire today.

336
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:52,049
Yeah.

337
00:12:52,051 --> 00:12:53,384
Hey, berta?

338
00:12:53,386 --> 00:12:56,620
Oh, for the love of god, what?

339
00:12:56,622 --> 00:12:57,721
I like your vest.

340
00:12:59,190 --> 00:13:00,824
Thanks.

341
00:13:00,826 --> 00:13:03,527
Where'd you get it, like,
the vest store or something?

342
00:13:04,963 --> 00:13:07,598
Thank god I'm high.

343
00:13:16,541 --> 00:13:18,042
Easy, easy.

344
00:13:18,044 --> 00:13:20,878
Sound the horn, let
the townfolk know you're coming.

345
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:23,047
(train whistle blows)

346
00:13:23,049 --> 00:13:26,984
The 9:04 from pemberton,
now arriving on track one.

347
00:13:26,986 --> 00:13:28,719
Right on time.

348
00:13:28,721 --> 00:13:31,088
I-I had no idea
this was so much fun.

349
00:13:31,090 --> 00:13:32,089
I know.

350
00:13:32,091 --> 00:13:33,824
(gasps)
look, alan...

351
00:13:33,826 --> 00:13:36,326
The mcdougal boy's
coming home from college.

352
00:13:37,562 --> 00:13:39,563
What a reunion this will be.

353
00:13:39,565 --> 00:13:41,598
Welcome home, jimmy!

354
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:44,334
Wow, you've, uh, created
your own little world here.

355
00:13:44,336 --> 00:13:46,203
Oh, yeah,
and this world's perfect.

356
00:13:46,205 --> 00:13:48,272
Well... Almost perfect.

357
00:13:49,174 --> 00:13:50,407
Jimmy's brother bobby

358
00:13:50,409 --> 00:13:52,876
Got a little too close
to the tracks one night.

359
00:13:52,878 --> 00:13:55,713
Him and his friends were playing
chicken with a freight train.

360
00:13:57,315 --> 00:14:00,617
They found his letterman jacket
three towns away.

361
00:14:00,619 --> 00:14:02,453
Oh, no.
Yeah.

362
00:14:02,455 --> 00:14:04,288
Engineer stan never got over it.

363
00:14:04,290 --> 00:14:06,123
He stopped talking to helen.

364
00:14:06,125 --> 00:14:08,492
He just sits in his room
and paints.

365
00:14:11,463 --> 00:14:14,331
Huh. That's, uh...
That's disturbing.

366
00:14:14,333 --> 00:14:17,034
On a couple of levels.

367
00:14:17,036 --> 00:14:18,936
You know it's
so nice having you.

368
00:14:18,938 --> 00:14:22,339
I don't know why, but train
enthusiasts tend to be loners.

369
00:14:22,341 --> 00:14:24,942
Yeah. It's a mystery.

370
00:14:24,944 --> 00:14:26,810
(phone rings)

371
00:14:26,812 --> 00:14:28,112
Hello?

372
00:14:28,114 --> 00:14:30,647
Hey, herb. It's walden.

373
00:14:30,649 --> 00:14:32,316
Oh. Hey, hold on a sec.

374
00:14:32,318 --> 00:14:34,118
Uh, I got to take this;
it's the office.

375
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:36,153
No problem. I was thinking
of heading over to the bar car

376
00:14:36,155 --> 00:14:38,222
To pick us up a couple
of frosty brews. You want one?

377
00:14:38,224 --> 00:14:39,723
Oh, make mine a root beer.

378
00:14:39,725 --> 00:14:41,358
This town's seen enough tragedy.

379
00:14:44,829 --> 00:14:45,829
(door closes)

380
00:14:45,831 --> 00:14:46,897
Hey, what's up?

381
00:14:46,899 --> 00:14:48,198
Is alan there?

382
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:50,467
Uh, actually, no,
I haven't seen him all day.

383
00:14:50,469 --> 00:14:52,035
I was really hoping
to talk to him.

384
00:14:52,037 --> 00:14:54,738
You can't talk
to a person that's not here.

385
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:57,107
Unless you draw a mustache
on the mirror.

386
00:14:57,109 --> 00:14:58,642
What?

387
00:14:58,644 --> 00:15:00,144
Is there a message
I can give him?

388
00:15:00,146 --> 00:15:02,045
Yeah, just tell him
I think I overreacted,

389
00:15:02,047 --> 00:15:03,714
And have him give me a call.

390
00:15:04,315 --> 00:15:06,083
Done and done. Bye-bye.

391
00:15:06,085 --> 00:15:08,118
Everything okay at the office?

392
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:10,420
Uh, actually, it,
uh, it wasn't work.

393
00:15:10,422 --> 00:15:11,388
No?

394
00:15:11,390 --> 00:15:12,489
It was the, uh,

395
00:15:12,491 --> 00:15:13,690
President of the railroad.

396
00:15:13,692 --> 00:15:15,526
He asked me to give you this.

397
00:15:17,128 --> 00:15:18,762
Congratulations, conductor alan!

398
00:15:18,764 --> 00:15:20,164
Oh, my god! Thank you!

399
00:15:20,166 --> 00:15:21,431
Now, let's get
that coal car unloaded

400
00:15:21,433 --> 00:15:23,400
And head over to the diner.

401
00:15:23,402 --> 00:15:25,435
Take a look at the new waitress.
Ooh!

402
00:15:25,437 --> 00:15:26,470
Word around town is,

403
00:15:26,472 --> 00:15:28,272
(whispers):
She goes all the way.

404
00:15:36,614 --> 00:15:38,582
(computer beeping)

405
00:15:38,584 --> 00:15:39,950
Hey, jake!

406
00:15:39,952 --> 00:15:41,018
Walden.

407
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:43,520
How are you?
What's going on, buddy?

408
00:15:43,522 --> 00:15:46,290
Not much.
Is my dad there?

409
00:15:46,292 --> 00:15:48,992
No. He actually moved out.

410
00:15:48,994 --> 00:15:51,628
(laughing):
Good one!

411
00:15:51,630 --> 00:15:52,796
No, I'm-I'm serious.

412
00:15:52,798 --> 00:15:55,165
We got in a fight,
and he left.

413
00:15:55,167 --> 00:15:58,101
My dad left that house?

414
00:15:58,103 --> 00:16:01,438
Yeah. We got in a fight, 'cause
he bought a cheap toaster.

415
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:02,840
W-wait, wait.

416
00:16:02,842 --> 00:16:06,176
And he bought something?

417
00:16:06,178 --> 00:16:09,947
Yeah. And I didn't show
any appreciation for it.

418
00:16:09,949 --> 00:16:12,783
He bought something
with his own money?

419
00:16:12,785 --> 00:16:15,419
I know. I shouldn't
have screamed at him.

420
00:16:15,421 --> 00:16:18,455
I-I should have
thrown him a parade.

421
00:16:18,457 --> 00:16:21,925
Wait a second,
am I being punk'd?

422
00:16:23,194 --> 00:16:25,195
Hey, you know, I got an idea.

423
00:16:25,197 --> 00:16:27,764
Um, you know, just 'cause your
dad doesn't live here anymore

424
00:16:27,766 --> 00:16:30,601
Doesn't mean that you couldn't
come stay for a couple of days.

425
00:16:30,603 --> 00:16:31,969
And do what?

426
00:16:31,971 --> 00:16:34,638
I don't know,
like hang out, do guy stuff.

427
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:37,207
We could go to a bar
and get drunk.

428
00:16:37,209 --> 00:16:39,710
Mm, I'm only 19; I can't drink.

429
00:16:39,712 --> 00:16:42,045
Well, fine,
we could just get high.

430
00:16:42,047 --> 00:16:45,782
Dude, just call my dad and tell
him you want him to come back.

431
00:16:45,784 --> 00:16:47,784
What if he says no?

432
00:16:47,786 --> 00:16:49,586
(snickers, laughs)

433
00:16:50,722 --> 00:16:52,789
Oh, you're serious.

434
00:16:52,791 --> 00:16:54,858
He's not gonna say no.

435
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:56,960
Where has he even been living?

436
00:16:56,962 --> 00:16:59,463
He moved into you guys's
old house with herb.

437
00:16:59,465 --> 00:17:01,798
Wow. If there was
a freeloaders hall of fame,

438
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:03,800
My dad would be living in it.

439
00:17:05,169 --> 00:17:07,704
For free.

440
00:17:09,507 --> 00:17:11,575
(doorbell rings)

441
00:17:17,482 --> 00:17:19,483
Hi, herb.

442
00:17:19,485 --> 00:17:21,852
Walden. What are
you doing here?

443
00:17:21,854 --> 00:17:23,086
I came to talk to alan.

444
00:17:23,088 --> 00:17:24,554
Oh.
Sorry, he's not home.

445
00:17:24,556 --> 00:17:26,256
I'll tell him
you stopped by.
Alan: Who's at the door?

446
00:17:26,258 --> 00:17:27,925
Nobody! Go back
in the train room!

447
00:17:29,193 --> 00:17:30,093
Alan?

448
00:17:30,095 --> 00:17:31,862
Walden?

449
00:17:31,864 --> 00:17:33,864
What's, uh,
what's going on?

450
00:17:33,866 --> 00:17:35,499
I wanted to say that I'm sorry.

451
00:17:35,501 --> 00:17:37,100
Really?
Yes.

452
00:17:37,102 --> 00:17:38,302
Super. Hatchet buried.

453
00:17:38,304 --> 00:17:39,403
We'll have you over
for thanksgiving.

454
00:17:39,405 --> 00:17:41,338
Hold on.

455
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:45,375
I never meant to make you
feel unwelcome in my home.

456
00:17:45,377 --> 00:17:48,211
Well, alan has
a new place now.

457
00:17:48,213 --> 00:17:50,280
A place where
he's appreciated.

458
00:17:50,282 --> 00:17:52,215
A place where
he feels safe.

459
00:17:53,518 --> 00:17:55,986
A place where he can cry
himself to sleep at night

460
00:17:55,988 --> 00:17:58,822
Without the fear
of being mocked.

461
00:17:58,824 --> 00:18:00,657
Y-you heard that?

462
00:18:00,659 --> 00:18:02,492
There's still
a baby monitor in there.

463
00:18:02,494 --> 00:18:05,462
So you also heard...

464
00:18:05,464 --> 00:18:07,764
Let it go, alan.

465
00:18:09,767 --> 00:18:11,301
I appreciate you, too.

466
00:18:11,303 --> 00:18:13,804
Th-that's why I've been leaving
messages with herb for days.

467
00:18:13,806 --> 00:18:15,038
What?

468
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:16,273
You haven't gotten them?

469
00:18:19,143 --> 00:18:21,144
Herb...
I'm sorry.

470
00:18:21,146 --> 00:18:22,846
I just wanted a friend.

471
00:18:22,848 --> 00:18:25,716
You know, one who
wasn't trapped in a mirror.

472
00:18:27,352 --> 00:18:29,186
Oh, herb.

473
00:18:29,188 --> 00:18:30,520
I brought you something.

474
00:18:30,522 --> 00:18:32,155
You did?

475
00:18:32,157 --> 00:18:35,158
You don't happen to
have a toaster, do you?

476
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:36,727
I have a toaster.

477
00:18:36,729 --> 00:18:39,930
I also have a...
A guest room with
a king-size bed

478
00:18:39,932 --> 00:18:42,265
And a new 42-inch
flat-screen tv.

479
00:18:42,267 --> 00:18:43,333
There's no tv in there.

480
00:18:43,335 --> 00:18:44,935
There could be.

481
00:18:44,937 --> 00:18:47,604
Really?

482
00:18:47,606 --> 00:18:49,539
Your turn.

483
00:18:49,541 --> 00:18:51,842
I'm not gonna
try to buy you.

484
00:18:51,844 --> 00:18:54,111
I mean, you're either
my friend or you're not.

485
00:18:54,113 --> 00:18:56,847
I have no such qualms—
I'll throw in a blu-ray player.

486
00:18:56,849 --> 00:18:59,349
Wow.
Okay, all right,
I'm out of here.

487
00:18:59,351 --> 00:19:00,984
No, no, wait, wait, wait.

488
00:19:00,986 --> 00:19:03,720
(sighs)
herb...

489
00:19:03,722 --> 00:19:07,124
I-I can't thank you enough
for taking me in,

490
00:19:07,126 --> 00:19:08,725
But...

491
00:19:08,727 --> 00:19:10,360
As you can see...

492
00:19:10,362 --> 00:19:12,195
Walden needs me.

493
00:19:12,197 --> 00:19:14,498
I wouldn't
go that far.
Shh...

494
00:19:15,833 --> 00:19:18,468
Let me, uh,
let me get my things.

495
00:19:21,005 --> 00:19:22,639
(sighs)

496
00:19:22,641 --> 00:19:25,375
What is it
about that little guy?

497
00:19:25,377 --> 00:19:28,278
What is it about us
that we're fighting over him?

498
00:19:35,119 --> 00:19:37,187
(funky, sultry music
playing on tv)

499
00:19:39,157 --> 00:19:40,390
Ooh.

500
00:19:40,392 --> 00:19:42,125
What do we have here?

501
00:19:42,127 --> 00:19:46,263
Uh-oh, she's being called
into the boss's office.

502
00:19:46,265 --> 00:19:49,733
Looks like somebody blew
the johnson account.

503
00:20:04,382 --> 00:20:06,249
Walden:
Really, alan?

504
00:20:07,685 --> 00:20:10,754
Oh, hey, hey! I, uh, I thought
you were still sleeping.

505
00:20:10,756 --> 00:20:14,458
It's 8:00 in the morning!

506
00:20:15,426 --> 00:20:17,094
So?

507
00:20:27,505 --> 00:20:29,339
Hey, herb. It's walden.

508
00:20:29,341 --> 00:20:32,542
How would you feel
about shared custody?
