1
00:00:20,826 --> 00:00:22,126
Are you happy?

2
00:00:22,128 --> 00:00:24,929
I was before you ate
that last garlic knot.

3
00:00:24,931 --> 00:00:27,065
Oh, I'm serious.
I mean, don't you think

4
00:00:27,067 --> 00:00:28,833
our relationship has become
a little bit predictable?

5
00:00:28,835 --> 00:00:31,135
Predictable? Yes.

6
00:00:31,137 --> 00:00:33,771
Why do you ask?
Well, I was thinking

7
00:00:33,773 --> 00:00:36,007
that maybe we could
spice things up a little.

8
00:00:36,009 --> 00:00:38,443
What'd you have in mind?

9
00:00:38,445 --> 00:00:40,445
Well, um...

10
00:00:40,447 --> 00:00:43,516
I have been reading
Fifty Shades of Grey.

11
00:00:43,518 --> 00:00:44,984
Oh.

12
00:00:44,986 --> 00:00:49,755
And I have some silk scarves
and, uh, some duct tape.

13
00:00:49,757 --> 00:00:51,757
Do you see this
taking place in a bedroom

14
00:00:51,759 --> 00:00:54,193
or the back
of a panel van?

15
00:00:54,195 --> 00:00:56,028
I don't know. I'm only
halfway through the book.

16
00:00:56,030 --> 00:00:57,964
Forget the book.

17
00:00:57,966 --> 00:01:00,700
What about you?
Do you have any fantasies?

18
00:01:00,702 --> 00:01:02,034
Ugh, of course I do.

19
00:01:02,036 --> 00:01:04,737
If lived only my regular
life, I'd eat a rifle.

20
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:06,505
Tell me one.

21
00:01:06,507 --> 00:01:09,075
Well, I...

22
00:01:09,077 --> 00:01:11,311
guess I always
wanted to...

23
00:01:11,313 --> 00:01:14,147
take some naughty
pictures of you.

24
00:01:14,149 --> 00:01:16,149
We could do that.
Really?

25
00:01:16,151 --> 00:01:19,152
Yeah, why not? There's already
a lot available online.

26
00:01:22,023 --> 00:01:23,323
What else?

27
00:01:23,325 --> 00:01:25,125
Oh, well, I-I-I guess

28
00:01:25,127 --> 00:01:28,394
it's a-a cliché
for a guy, but, um...

29
00:01:28,396 --> 00:01:31,665
I've always wanted
to have a-a threesome.

30
00:01:31,667 --> 00:01:33,333
Okay.

31
00:01:33,335 --> 00:01:34,934
Now, I know
it's silly. I know.

32
00:01:34,936 --> 00:01:37,036
No, I mean, okay,
we can do it.

33
00:01:38,339 --> 00:01:40,006
If you are messing
with me,

34
00:01:40,008 --> 00:01:42,909
there is no way
I will ever forgive you!

35
00:01:42,911 --> 00:01:45,412
I'm not messing with you.

36
00:01:45,414 --> 00:01:47,114
Seriously, we can
have a threesome?

37
00:01:47,116 --> 00:01:49,950
- Come on, you'd do the same for me.
- Of course I would.

38
00:01:49,952 --> 00:01:52,219
Good, 'cause I have
a fantasy of my own.

39
00:01:52,221 --> 00:01:54,321
Oh, hmm, lay it
on me, baby.

40
00:01:54,323 --> 00:01:56,724
I want to have
a threesome also.

41
00:01:56,726 --> 00:01:58,626
See? See?

42
00:01:58,628 --> 00:02:01,729
This is why communication is
so important in a relationship.

43

I mean, two minutes ago

44
00:02:03,133 --> 00:02:04,999
I didn't care if
you lived or died.

45
00:02:05,001 --> 00:02:10,304
Now I love you more than
any man has ever loved a woman.

46
00:02:10,306 --> 00:02:11,605
You complete me,

47
00:02:11,607 --> 00:02:14,107
but add another chick
and I'll complete myself.

48
00:02:14,109 --> 00:02:15,876
Great!

49
00:02:15,878 --> 00:02:17,278
So what's your
pleasure, treasure?

50
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,312
Blonde? Brunette?

51
00:02:18,314 --> 00:02:20,281
Someone with a little
junk in the trunk?

52
00:02:20,283 --> 00:02:21,448
No, no.

53
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:23,684
In my threesome, there's you, me,
Mm-hmm?

and another guy.

You have your fantasy;

and he's feeling very
vulnerable right now.

85
00:03:58,297 --> 00:03:59,630
I think this would help.

86
00:03:59,632 --> 00:04:01,498

get out of my comfort zone,

Sure, like what?

176
00:08:07,183 --> 00:08:10,251
Uh, well, uh, for instance, uh,
there are a few things

177
00:08:10,253 --> 00:08:13,755
that I happen to know Lyndsey
is not exactly fond of doing.

178
00:08:13,757 --> 00:08:15,991
No, I'm good.

179
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:18,927
R-Really? You're good?

180
00:08:19,629 --> 00:08:21,363
With everything?

181
00:08:21,365 --> 00:08:23,999
Even the Philadelphia
Dump Truck?

182
00:08:24,001 --> 00:08:26,168
Back it up.

183
00:08:26,170 --> 00:08:28,337
Beep, beep, beep, beep.

184
00:08:30,907 --> 00:08:32,375
Anything else?

185
00:08:32,377 --> 00:08:34,743
Uh, well, I guess this goes
without saying,

186
00:08:34,745 --> 00:08:37,379
but, uh, you know, we're
not making Band-Aids here,

187
00:08:37,381 --> 00:08:39,881
so Johnson should never
meet Johnson, so...

188
00:08:39,883 --> 00:08:42,283
True.

189
00:08:42,285 --> 00:08:44,852
Two dongs don't make a right.

190
00:08:50,793 --> 00:08:52,561
Oh, oh, and speaking of, um,

191
00:08:52,563 --> 00:08:56,398
if you have any desire to stick
your tongue in my mouth,

192
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:57,633
just stick
your tongue

193
00:08:57,635 --> 00:08:58,668
in her mouth,

194
00:08:58,670 --> 00:08:59,936
and then she'll
stick her tongue

195
00:08:59,938 --> 00:09:02,405
in my mouth, and we'll consider
the circle complete.

196
00:09:04,775 --> 00:09:06,109
Fine.

197
00:09:06,111 --> 00:09:07,610
It's your loss.

198
00:09:09,513 --> 00:09:12,882
I would like to propose a toast.

199
00:09:12,884 --> 00:09:15,284

226
00:10:54,688 --> 00:10:56,822
Yeah, I mean,
what I'm saying is

227
00:10:56,824 --> 00:10:58,223
you're younger than I am;

228
00:10:58,225 --> 00:11:01,026
you're prettier than I am;
there's more...

231
00:11:06,967 --> 00:11:08,033
Well,
I'm just saying,

232
00:11:08,035 --> 00:11:09,267
we're playing on
a public course here.

233
00:11:09,269 --> 00:11:10,768

235

with the ribbons.

236
00:11:18,711 --> 00:11:21,879
No, no, that is not my style.

237
00:11:21,881 --> 00:11:23,347
I'm very aggressive.

238
00:11:24,216 --> 00:11:25,549
I'm in it to win it.

239
00:11:27,086 --> 00:11:30,387

240
00:11:30,389 --> 00:11:33,391
I am definitely gonna win it.

Yeah, thanks.

00:11:39,266 --> 00:11:41,733
Ooh.

245
00:11:46,405 --> 00:11:48,940
This is probably bad to say,

246
00:11:48,942 --> 00:11:51,576
but Zoey had an outfit
like that

247
00:11:51,578 --> 00:11:52,644
she used to wear
all the time.

248
00:11:52,646 --> 00:11:54,746
Well, not all the time.

249
00:11:54,748 --> 00:11:57,215
Just when we
were having sex.

250
00:11:57,217 --> 00:11:59,250
Which was pretty much
all the time.

251
00:11:59,252 --> 00:12:02,720
I'm sorry, sweetie.

252
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:05,991

okay, uh, um...

253
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:18,837
You know, I-I, um,
I not only loved Zoey.

254
00:12:18,839 --> 00:12:20,572
I also loved
her daughter.

255
00:12:20,574 --> 00:12:24,743
That is beautiful.

256
00:12:34,688 --> 00:12:36,689
I kinda thought we
were gonna be family.

257
00:12:36,691 --> 00:12:39,358
We're your family now.

258
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:42,328
I'm starting to feel a little
like a very distant cousin.

259
00:12:47,001 --> 00:12:50,303
I miss her so much.

260
00:12:52,473 --> 00:12:55,575

In fact,

271

if it would help, you can close

00:13:53,294 --> 00:13:55,927
I can't.

284
00:13:56,964 --> 00:13:58,430
I can't do this!

it still counts as dessert.

What did she want?

327
00:15:40,103 --> 00:15:42,970
Well, she wanted to tell me,
in no particular order,

328
00:15:42,972 --> 00:15:45,172
that you're a great guy,

329
00:15:45,174 --> 00:15:47,374
that you're still very much
in love with me

330
00:15:47,376 --> 00:15:50,877
and that I'm a complete idiot
for breaking up with you.

331
00:15:50,879 --> 00:15:54,580
I am. I am. You are.

332
00:15:54,582 --> 00:15:56,815

to that call, did you?

333
00:15:56,817 --> 00:15:58,684
No, not at all.

It's been very hard for me too.

336
00:16:02,157 --> 00:16:06,092

that you'd say that.

337
00:16:06,094 --> 00:16:08,227
So, do you think that...

338
00:16:08,229 --> 00:16:10,563

00:17:04,587 --> 00:17:06,287
Eh, I guess.

354
00:17:06,289 --> 00:17:07,889
What's wrong with her?

355
00:17:07,891 --> 00:17:10,758
Well, her outfit's a little
matchy-matchy, isn't it?

356
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:13,527
The outfit's going to be
on the floor of the bedroom.

357
00:17:13,529 --> 00:17:16,264
Well, still, it says something
about her lack of imagination.

358
00:17:16,266 --> 00:17:18,500
Fine.

359
00:17:18,502 --> 00:17:20,035
Hey, how 'bout the redhead?

360
00:17:20,037 --> 00:17:21,303
Ooh, redheads.

361
00:17:21,305 --> 00:17:22,438
They do dirty things.

362
00:17:23,507 --> 00:17:25,708
So, should we approach her?

363
00:17:25,710 --> 00:17:26,742
No, no, hang on.
Hang on.

364
00:17:26,744 --> 00:17:27,843
She's got a tramp stamp.

365
00:17:27,845 --> 00:17:29,445
So?

366
00:17:29,447 --> 00:17:30,780
It's a little skanky,
isn't it?

367
00:17:30,782 --> 00:17:33,549
We're trying to invite her
to a threesome.

368
00:17:33,551 --> 00:17:34,617
Skanky is good.

369
00:17:34,619 --> 00:17:37,086
You're right.
You're right.

370
00:17:37,088 --> 00:17:39,956
Oh, although,
she does have cankles.

371
00:17:39,958 --> 00:17:42,359
Skanky cankles.

372
00:17:42,361 --> 00:17:44,695
Isn't that what they call
Santa Claus in Norway?

373
00:17:44,697 --> 00:17:46,297
Are you done?

374
00:17:46,299 --> 00:17:49,667
Sorry, just a little case
of the pre-ménage jitters.

375
00:17:52,037 --> 00:17:53,571
You do realize
if I wasn't here,

376
00:17:53,573 --> 00:17:54,973
you couldn't get
any of these women?

377
00:17:54,975 --> 00:17:56,508
I'm not
so sure about that.

378
00:17:56,510 --> 00:17:57,943
I still have a few moves
up my sleeve.

379
00:17:57,945 --> 00:17:59,311
Really?
Mm-hmm.

380
00:17:59,313 --> 00:18:00,345
Be my guest.

381
00:18:00,347 --> 00:18:04,449
Fine. Okay, watch this.

382
00:18:04,451 --> 00:18:06,552
Hello.

383
00:18:06,554 --> 00:18:08,654
No.

384
00:18:15,430 --> 00:18:17,697
I'm good with whoever you pick.

385
00:18:17,699 --> 00:18:20,067
♪ Men. ♪

386
00:18:20,069 --> 00:18:21,068
I'm confused.

387
00:18:21,070 --> 00:18:22,703
The only reason
you're doing this

388
00:18:22,705 --> 00:18:24,371
is because
it's your husband's fantasy?

389
00:18:24,373 --> 00:18:25,706
Ex-husband.

390
00:18:25,708 --> 00:18:27,975
Ah.
Ah.

391
00:18:29,844 --> 00:18:30,911
Wow.

392
00:18:30,913 --> 00:18:32,913
What a view.

393
00:18:32,915 --> 00:18:35,616
The view from here
is pretty good, too.

394
00:18:35,618 --> 00:18:36,917
Certainly is.

395
00:18:38,186 --> 00:18:41,188
I'm gonna end up watching from
the sidelines again, aren't I?

396
00:18:41,190 --> 00:18:43,991
You're lucky you
can get to watch.

397
00:18:50,031 --> 00:18:51,065
Wow.

398
00:18:51,067 --> 00:18:53,601
You two look really lovely.

399
00:18:53,603 --> 00:18:54,869
Y-You could
actually be sisters.

400
00:18:54,871 --> 00:18:57,071
That is exactly wrong.

401
00:18:57,073 --> 00:19:01,109
Oh, no, I meant, uh,
I meant, uh, sistahs.

402
00:19:01,111 --> 00:19:05,046
like, uh, "Sistahs doing it
for themselves."

403
00:19:05,048 --> 00:19:06,514
What's the deal?

404
00:19:06,516 --> 00:19:08,716
Is he dying and this
is on his bucket list?

405
00:19:08,718 --> 00:19:10,618
It's complicated.

406
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:11,819
Just stay focused on me.

407
00:19:11,821 --> 00:19:13,755
Okay.

408
00:19:13,757 --> 00:19:16,791
So, uh, shall we get
this party started?

409
00:19:16,793 --> 00:19:20,963
Great. Is there somewhere
where I can just freshen up?

410
00:19:20,965 --> 00:19:22,664
Sure, the bathroom's
down the hall.

411
00:19:22,666 --> 00:19:24,232
Okay, be right back.

412
00:19:27,238 --> 00:19:29,638
Um, so, how are we
slicing up this pie?

413
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:30,639
What?

414
00:19:30,641 --> 00:19:32,475
You know, who gets what when?

415
00:19:32,477 --> 00:19:33,609
Or we just gonna take shifts

416
00:19:33,611 --> 00:19:35,812
and tap each other out
like wrestlers?

417
00:19:38,249 --> 00:19:40,250
Nice to meet you, too.
Yeah.

418
00:19:40,252 --> 00:19:44,788
So, uh, how do you know Lyndsey
and, uh, the old guy?

419
00:19:44,790 --> 00:19:46,290
Oh, Alan.

420
00:19:46,292 --> 00:19:48,926
He lives here.
This is my house.

421
00:19:48,928 --> 00:19:50,561
No kidding.

422
00:19:51,396 --> 00:19:52,830
Oh, oh, and one more thing:

423
00:19:52,832 --> 00:19:54,799
um, if I yell "cheeseburger,"
it means I'm getting close,

424
00:19:54,801 --> 00:19:56,967
and you need to whack me
on the back of the head

425
00:19:56,969 --> 00:19:58,102
'cause I want this to last.

426
00:19:58,104 --> 00:20:00,504
You're so cute.

427
00:20:00,506 --> 00:20:01,939
I love you.

428
00:20:01,941 --> 00:20:03,607
I love you, too.

429
00:20:05,543 --> 00:20:06,510
Oh, no.

430
00:20:06,512 --> 00:20:08,112
No!

431
00:20:08,114 --> 00:20:09,280
Oh, man!

432
00:20:09,282 --> 00:20:11,482
I just cannot catch a break.

433
00:20:27,127 --> 00:20:29,661
She sounds fun.

434
00:20:32,199 --> 00:20:33,898
So does he.

435
00:20:35,835 --> 00:20:40,205
You know, if we close our eyes
and don't say anything...

436
00:20:40,207 --> 00:20:42,006
Way ahead of you, Walden.

437
00:20:42,875 --> 00:20:44,542
Cheeseburger!

438
00:20:44,544 --> 00:20:48,544
