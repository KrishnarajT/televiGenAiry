1
00:00:01,923 --> 00:00:03,429
Previously
on Two and a Half Men...

2
00:00:03,529 --> 00:00:05,162
You seem awfully quiet tonight.
Is everything okay?

3
00:00:05,164 --> 00:00:07,464
I-I've just got
a lot on my mind.

4
00:00:07,466 --> 00:00:10,251
Well, a problem shared
is a problem halved.

5
00:00:10,253 --> 00:00:11,802
I think we should break up.

6
00:00:11,804 --> 00:00:14,171
Lyndsey's downstairs
breaking up with Alan.

7
00:00:14,173 --> 00:00:15,306
Really?

8
00:00:15,308 --> 00:00:17,040
He's gonna be
devastated.

9
00:00:17,042 --> 00:00:19,343
He was madly in love with her.
They've been dating for years.

10
00:00:19,345 --> 00:00:20,611
They were planning
on getting married.

11
00:00:20,613 --> 00:00:22,263
I-I still love you, Alan.

12
00:00:23,315 --> 00:00:25,933
I'm just not in love
with you anymore.

13
00:00:26,718 --> 00:00:27,551
Hey, Zip.

14
00:00:27,553 --> 00:00:29,103
Just want to be left alone.

15
00:00:29,105 --> 00:00:31,155
Lyndsey's crazy
for breaking up with you.

16
00:00:31,157 --> 00:00:32,656
You are a great guy.

17
00:00:32,658 --> 00:00:33,574
Thank you.

18
00:00:33,576 --> 00:00:35,242
You'll find somebody else.

19
00:00:35,244 --> 00:00:36,577
As good as Lyndsey?

20
00:00:36,579 --> 00:00:37,861
Look at you.

21
00:00:37,863 --> 00:00:40,063
Already making jokes.

22
00:00:46,705 --> 00:00:49,089
Hey. What you doing?

23
00:00:49,091 --> 00:00:51,642
Oh, just taking a stroll
down memory lane.

24
00:00:51,644 --> 00:00:54,278
It's a photo book
that Lyndsey gave me.

25
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:58,115
Oh. Here we are
at the Santa Monica Pier.

26
00:00:58,117 --> 00:01:00,250
"Oh, Alan,
I'm having such a great time.

27
00:01:00,252 --> 00:01:02,603
"I know it looks like
I'm eating cotton candy,

28
00:01:02,605 --> 00:01:05,472
"but really I'm just waiting
for someone better to come along

29
00:01:05,474 --> 00:01:07,441
so I can dump your sorry ass."

30
00:01:07,443 --> 00:01:10,261
That dude in the Speedo
totally photo-bombed you.

31
00:01:10,263 --> 00:01:12,947
Bet she was sleeping
with him, too.

32
00:01:12,949 --> 00:01:15,366
And look at the guy
with the churros.

33
00:01:15,368 --> 00:01:17,434
What's he smiling about?

34
00:01:17,436 --> 00:01:20,271
Okay, you know what? You
can't live in the past.

35
00:01:20,273 --> 00:01:22,172
You also can't
live in this robe.

36
00:01:22,174 --> 00:01:25,276
It's like the sacred
shroud of urine.

37
00:01:25,278 --> 00:01:27,161
What happened?
Lyndsey and I were supposed

38
00:01:27,163 --> 00:01:30,247
to take care of each other
for the rest of our lives.

39
00:01:30,249 --> 00:01:31,799
She'd

40
00:01:31,801 --> 00:01:34,802
blend my steak
so I didn't have to gum it.

41
00:01:34,804 --> 00:01:38,555
I'd change the tennis balls
on the bottom of her walker.

42
00:01:39,691 --> 00:01:42,393
We'd keep track
of each other's moles.

43
00:01:42,395 --> 00:01:44,795
It's a romantic picture.

44
00:01:44,797 --> 00:01:46,313
Glad you think so.

45
00:01:46,315 --> 00:01:48,632
'Cause now
that's just gonna be you and me.

46
00:01:48,634 --> 00:01:51,018
It's not gonna be you and me

47
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:55,239
because A)... no.

48
00:01:55,241 --> 00:01:58,492
And B) you're gonna find
somebody new.

49
00:01:58,494 --> 00:02:00,244
You just have to have
a positive attitude.

50
00:02:00,246 --> 00:02:01,712
If you say you
can't, you're right.

51
00:02:01,714 --> 00:02:03,330
If you say you
can, you might.

52
00:02:03,332 --> 00:02:05,749
(blows raspberry)

53
00:02:05,751 --> 00:02:07,117
Do that again.

54
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:09,253
(blows raspberry)
Ow!

55
00:02:09,255 --> 00:02:10,504
Ow!
Now, suck it up!

56
00:02:10,506 --> 00:02:12,756
Ow!
You're gonna find somebody new!

57
00:02:12,758 --> 00:02:14,041
I can't.

58
00:02:14,043 --> 00:02:15,376
Why not?
Look at me!

59
00:02:15,378 --> 00:02:16,510
(mumbles gibberish mockingly)

60
00:02:16,512 --> 00:02:18,545
(mumbles)
What?

61
00:02:18,547 --> 00:02:21,432
Look at me. When I met Lyndsey,
I was a solid six.

62
00:02:21,434 --> 00:02:23,717
Now I'm a soft four at best.

63
00:02:23,719 --> 00:02:26,353
Really? You thought
you were a six?

64
00:02:26,355 --> 00:02:32,059
Well, maybe not a Malibu six,
but a Wal-Mart six.

65
00:02:33,611 --> 00:02:35,145
And it didn't matter.
I was in love.

66
00:02:35,147 --> 00:02:37,013
No one takes care of themselves
when they're in love.

67
00:02:37,015 --> 00:02:38,899
When you know you can have sex
in a sweatshirt,

68
00:02:38,901 --> 00:02:39,983
you stop doing sit-ups.

69
00:02:39,985 --> 00:02:41,535
Well, then,
do something about it.

70
00:02:41,537 --> 00:02:44,104
Get yourself back in shape,
get some new clothes,

71
00:02:44,106 --> 00:02:46,206
get a haircut,
get your own place.

72
00:02:46,208 --> 00:02:49,192
Anything to get
your confidence back.

73
00:02:49,194 --> 00:02:51,862
Look, I appreciate the pep talk,
but I've lost all hope.

74
00:02:51,864 --> 00:02:53,464
Well, I can't give you hope,

75
00:02:53,466 --> 00:02:56,667
but I-I can give you
my American Express Black Card.

76
00:02:56,669 --> 00:02:59,303
Hope's for losers.

Original Air Date on May 2, 2013

85
00:03:30,193 --> 00:03:32,027
(Skype ringtone plays)

86
00:03:32,029 --> 00:03:33,364
Oh, hey, Walden.

87
00:03:33,365 --> 00:03:35,748
Hey, Jake, what's going on?

88
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:37,483
I was just calling my dad back.

89
00:03:37,485 --> 00:03:38,751
He left me a voice mail.

90
00:03:38,753 --> 00:03:40,386
At least, I think it was him.

91
00:03:40,388 --> 00:03:42,655
It was just, like, two minutes
of someone sobbing

92
00:03:42,657 --> 00:03:44,557
and then throwing up.

93
00:03:44,559 --> 00:03:47,143
Yeah, that was him.

94
00:03:47,145 --> 00:03:49,245
How often does he cry?

95
00:03:49,247 --> 00:03:52,298
It'd be quicker to tell you
how often he doesn't.

96
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:53,749
He's gonna be okay, right?

97
00:03:53,751 --> 00:03:57,303
Yeah, he actually got dressed
today and left the house.

98
00:03:57,305 --> 00:03:59,389
And-and-and he even
put on deodorant.

99
00:03:59,391 --> 00:04:02,358
Well, I-I actually
put it on him, but he let me,

100
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:04,610
so... that's progress.

101
00:04:04,612 --> 00:04:07,213
I'm so glad
that you're there for my dad.

102
00:04:07,215 --> 00:04:10,650
You're like the son
he never had.

103
00:04:11,485 --> 00:04:13,769
Right.

104
00:04:14,955 --> 00:04:17,156
Okay, so I'm gonna get going.

105
00:04:17,158 --> 00:04:20,159
Yeah, yeah, me, too.
I got to go run some black ops

106
00:04:20,161 --> 00:04:21,444
and test some ballistic weapons.

107
00:04:21,446 --> 00:04:23,629
Really? That...
that sounds awesome.

108
00:04:23,631 --> 00:04:25,298
No, I'm just messing with you.

109
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:28,751
I'm gonna go get high and make,
like, 800 cupcakes.

110
00:04:29,837 --> 00:04:33,089
Sleep well, America.

111
00:04:33,091 --> 00:04:35,992
Ta-da!

112
00:04:35,994 --> 00:04:38,294
Wow!

113
00:04:42,666 --> 00:04:45,184
Wow!

114
00:04:45,186 --> 00:04:46,686
You look...

115
00:04:47,821 --> 00:04:49,522
Look at you.

116
00:04:49,524 --> 00:04:51,324
This is your vision, my friend.

117
00:04:51,326 --> 00:04:55,661
Oh, no, I could not
envision this.

118
00:04:55,663 --> 00:04:59,282
You were right. It's time for me
to get back to living life.

119
00:04:59,284 --> 00:05:01,284
Uh, check out my sweet onion.

120
00:05:01,286 --> 00:05:03,453
My bodacious Vidalia.

121
00:05:04,371 --> 00:05:08,157
Wow. How did you pack
all of you in there?

122
00:05:08,159 --> 00:05:11,594
Ah, well, uh, I guess
I would have to say, it's...

123
00:05:11,596 --> 00:05:15,298
Spanx to these.

124
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:16,999
Is that a girdle?

125
00:05:17,001 --> 00:05:19,519
Oh, no. Uh, it's a-a male sport
control top.

126
00:05:19,521 --> 00:05:20,803
It's for athletes.

127
00:05:20,805 --> 00:05:23,339
Athletes with man boobs.

128
00:05:23,341 --> 00:05:24,774
Not anymore.

129
00:05:24,776 --> 00:05:26,059
(laughs)

130
00:05:26,061 --> 00:05:29,112
Uh, Heather, the salesgirl,
said I look like a "DILD."

131
00:05:29,114 --> 00:05:30,780
Oh?

132
00:05:30,782 --> 00:05:35,118
It stands for,
"dad I'd like to do."

133
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,820
Okay. Uh, let's-let's talk
about that hair.

134
00:05:37,822 --> 00:05:39,238
Walk me through that.

135
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:42,241
Oh, uh, a-a young man named Juan
did this to me.

136
00:05:42,243 --> 00:05:45,294
Um, uh,
he does Justin Bieber's hair.

137
00:05:45,296 --> 00:05:46,712
Oh, wow, that's lucky.

138
00:05:46,714 --> 00:05:49,799
I-I know. Can't believe
Justin Bieber goes to Supercuts.

139
00:05:49,801 --> 00:05:52,135
Um...

140
00:05:52,137 --> 00:05:53,369
Driving home, you can't imagine

141
00:05:53,371 --> 00:05:55,037
how many people
were checking me out.

142
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:57,423
Oh, I can imagine.

143
00:05:57,425 --> 00:06:00,226
What do you say we go someplace
and try out my new look?

144
00:06:00,228 --> 00:06:02,878
I want to get my groove on
with the hip, funky people.

145
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:06,149
Okay, yeah, I'll see if I can
fire up the time machine,

146
00:06:06,151 --> 00:06:07,984
and we'll head back to 1974.

147
00:06:07,986 --> 00:06:10,887
I'll, uh...
I'll put my stuff away.

148
00:06:10,889 --> 00:06:12,105
Uh, Alan?

149
00:06:12,107 --> 00:06:13,272
Yeah?

150
00:06:13,274 --> 00:06:14,574
My credit card?

151
00:06:14,576 --> 00:06:16,109
Oh, uh, right.

152
00:06:16,111 --> 00:06:18,277
(laughs)

153
00:06:22,583 --> 00:06:23,699
Release.

154
00:06:23,701 --> 00:06:25,868
I'm trying.

155
00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:36,012
(indistinct chatter)

156
00:06:36,014 --> 00:06:37,296
Wow.

157
00:06:37,298 --> 00:06:40,933
I'm seeing your hairdo
everywhere I look.

158
00:06:40,935 --> 00:06:44,470
Best ten bucks I ever spent.

159
00:06:45,272 --> 00:06:48,474
I wish I had my deck of cards.

160
00:06:48,476 --> 00:06:49,942
Your deck of cards?

161
00:06:49,944 --> 00:06:52,094
Oh, yeah. Close-up magic
is a great icebreaker

162
00:06:52,096 --> 00:06:54,113
with the ladies.

163
00:06:54,115 --> 00:06:57,283
What is wrong with you?

164
00:06:57,285 --> 00:06:59,485
What is wrong with you

165
00:06:59,487 --> 00:07:01,904
that you have a
quarter in your ear?

166
00:07:01,906 --> 00:07:03,372
Give me that.

167
00:07:03,374 --> 00:07:04,874
Come on.
You're a charming guy.

168
00:07:04,876 --> 00:07:07,577
Just be yourself,
stick to your strengths.

169
00:07:07,579 --> 00:07:08,878
I-I'm sorry. I-I can't hear you.

170
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,496
I have a quarter in my ear.

171
00:07:10,498 --> 00:07:12,465
Will you stop that?

172
00:07:12,467 --> 00:07:15,251
What about her?
Go buy her a drink.

173
00:07:15,253 --> 00:07:18,304
She's a little out of
my league, isn't she?

174
00:07:18,306 --> 00:07:21,290
You're not even playing
in the same sport.

175
00:07:22,259 --> 00:07:24,477
Just go say hi.

176

Okay, here goes.

177

Uh, hi. Can I buy you a drink?

178
00:07:30,801 --> 00:07:34,320
Uh, no, thanks.
I already have one.

179
00:07:34,322 --> 00:07:38,908
Uh, can I reimburse you
for that one?

180
00:07:38,910 --> 00:07:40,326
Excuse me?

181
00:07:40,328 --> 00:07:42,745
Well, I would have happily
bought you a drink

182
00:07:42,747 --> 00:07:44,997
if I had arrived
a few moments earlier.

183
00:07:44,999 --> 00:07:47,450

Well, hello.

195
00:08:16,698 --> 00:08:19,448
Yeah, before we go any
further, I should warn you

196
00:08:19,450 --> 00:08:22,952

horrific industrial accident

197
00:08:22,954 --> 00:08:24,787
down there.

I'm a back doctor,

205

I can't check out your front.

00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:23,646
Are you... Look at him.
He is a cake.

357
00:16:23,648 --> 00:16:26,266
Right, right. Pl-Plus,
we don't want to get him

358
00:16:26,268 --> 00:16:28,434
all hopped up
on sugar.

359
00:16:28,436 --> 00:16:29,902
(quietly):
Come here.

360
00:16:29,904 --> 00:16:34,107
There are a billion women
in this world. Why this one?

361
00:16:34,109 --> 00:16:36,909
(quietly): I don't know. She's like
a-a powerful sex magnet,

362
00:16:36,911 --> 00:16:40,697
and I'm like a...
sex refrigerator.

363
00:16:40,699 --> 00:16:42,498
What does that even mean?
(sighs)

364
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:44,200
I have no idea
what it means. I just...

365
00:16:44,202 --> 00:16:46,202
I-I need you to babysit
her decomposing husband

366
00:16:46,204 --> 00:16:47,704
while I plow his wife.

367
00:16:49,957 --> 00:16:52,125
It's their anniversary.

368
00:17:00,951 --> 00:17:03,136
Oh, come on.

369
00:17:09,393 --> 00:17:11,527
G...

370
00:17:11,529 --> 00:17:15,398
Looks like you...
found a new friend, Vic.

371
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:17,784
Can I call you Vic?

372
00:17:17,786 --> 00:17:19,786
I'm gonna call you Vic.

373
00:17:21,188 --> 00:17:23,356
(sighs)

374
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:29,662
Is this what I have
to look forward to, Vic?

375
00:17:29,664 --> 00:17:32,699
You live your life,
you try to be a good person,

376
00:17:32,701 --> 00:17:35,168
you work hard
to achieve your goals,

377
00:17:35,170 --> 00:17:36,919
only to end up a prisoner
to your own body

378
00:17:36,921 --> 00:17:38,871
while the love of your life
is in the next room

379
00:17:38,873 --> 00:17:42,058
doing the splits for some idiot
she met in a bar.

380
00:17:42,910 --> 00:17:45,395
I mean, if this is it,
just kill me now.

381
00:17:45,397 --> 00:17:47,447
(flatline tone)

382
00:17:50,234 --> 00:17:51,851
Vic?

383
00:17:51,853 --> 00:17:53,269
Vic?

384
00:17:53,271 --> 00:17:54,987
Aw, come on!

385
00:17:58,325 --> 00:18:00,777
Alan!

386
00:18:00,779 --> 00:18:02,779
ALAN:
Bad time, Walden!

387
00:18:02,781 --> 00:18:06,565
It's even worse out
here! Open the door!

388
00:18:06,567 --> 00:18:08,584
(quietly):
What could be so important?

389
00:18:08,586 --> 00:18:11,904
I'm pretty sure that your
girlfriend's husband is dead.

390
00:18:11,906 --> 00:18:13,572
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Slow down.

391
00:18:13,574 --> 00:18:15,908
She's not my girlfriend.

392
00:18:17,878 --> 00:18:20,596
MEGHAN:
No, no, no. He can't die here.

393
00:18:20,598 --> 00:18:22,515
I think he already did.

394
00:18:22,517 --> 00:18:25,518
No, you don't understand.
He can't die here.

395
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:28,020
I have an infidelity clause
in my prenup.

396
00:18:28,022 --> 00:18:30,690
If his greedy 70-year-old kids
find out that I was here,

397
00:18:30,692 --> 00:18:33,142
they'll take all my money.

398
00:18:33,144 --> 00:18:35,278
Are you kidding?
Your money?

399
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,980
Well, in all fairness, she did
earn it the old-fashioned way.

400
00:18:38,932 --> 00:18:40,400
Well, thank you, Alan.

401
00:18:40,402 --> 00:18:41,784
Show a little respect.

402
00:18:41,786 --> 00:18:44,620
Now stuff him in the car
while I go find my panties.

403
00:18:45,973 --> 00:18:47,106
(quietly):
Look at what you did.

404
00:18:47,108 --> 00:18:48,658
You got my girlfriend upset.

405
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:50,793
I thought she wasn't
your girlfriend.

406
00:18:50,795 --> 00:18:52,462
She's gonna inherit
millions of dollars.

407
00:18:52,464 --> 00:18:53,796
She's my girlfriend.

408
00:18:57,918 --> 00:18:59,469
MEGHAN:
Okay,

409
00:18:59,471 --> 00:19:00,803
when we get there,
we'll put him in his bed,

410
00:19:00,805 --> 00:19:02,955
you guys leave
and I'll call 911.

411
00:19:02,957 --> 00:19:04,623
Don't worry, sweetheart,
after the funeral

412
00:19:04,625 --> 00:19:07,143
we'll go someplace warm and
beautiful where we can heal.

413
00:19:07,145 --> 00:19:08,594
And tan.

414
00:19:08,596 --> 00:19:12,014
And swim with the dolphins.
Ee-ee, ee-ee!

415
00:19:12,016 --> 00:19:14,517
You two dreamers
do realize

416
00:19:14,519 --> 00:19:16,769
that what we're doing
right now is a felony.

417
00:19:16,771 --> 00:19:18,237
I-I realize
and I owe you one.

418
00:19:18,239 --> 00:19:20,973
One? Seriously? One?

419
00:19:22,526 --> 00:19:24,026
I want ice cream!

420
00:19:24,028 --> 00:19:25,661

Oh, yes.
