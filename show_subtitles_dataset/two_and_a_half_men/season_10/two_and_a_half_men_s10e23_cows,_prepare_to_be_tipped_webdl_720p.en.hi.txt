1
00:00:08,124 --> 00:00:11,910
You are so pretty.
Thank you.

2
00:00:11,912 --> 00:00:14,379
Pretty, pretty, pretty,
pretty, pretty...

3
00:00:14,381 --> 00:00:17,299
Okay, okay, okay, pretty man
trying to drive a car here.

4
00:00:17,301 --> 00:00:20,102
(giggling)

5
00:00:20,104 --> 00:00:23,639
How did you get more drunk
since we left the party?

6
00:00:23,641 --> 00:00:28,310
Well... I brought a roadie.

7
00:00:28,312 --> 00:00:29,812
Where did you get that?

8
00:00:29,814 --> 00:00:32,314
My purse.

9
00:00:32,316 --> 00:00:33,899
Hmm. Your purse.

10
00:00:33,901 --> 00:00:35,484
(gasps)

11
00:00:35,486 --> 00:00:37,452
Oh, no, it spilled!

12
00:00:37,454 --> 00:00:39,321
(sighs)
Oh!

13
00:00:39,323 --> 00:00:40,706
(slurps)

14
00:00:40,708 --> 00:00:42,407
Do you want some?

15
00:00:42,409 --> 00:00:45,160
No. You-you need
to get rid of that drink.

16
00:00:45,162 --> 00:00:48,330
Fine... Mr. Man.

17
00:00:48,332 --> 00:00:49,548
(rattling)

18
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:50,999
(laughs)

19
00:00:51,001 --> 00:00:52,450
Oops!

20
00:00:52,452 --> 00:00:54,219
Okay.

21
00:00:54,221 --> 00:00:57,422
I think it's time to get Stacey
home and under the covers.

22
00:00:57,424 --> 00:01:01,727
I think it's time to get
Walden home and under Stacey.

23
00:01:02,645 --> 00:01:04,563
That's not going to happen.

24
00:01:04,565 --> 00:01:06,181
Boo!

25
00:01:06,183 --> 00:01:07,850
Maybe another time.

26
00:01:07,852 --> 00:01:09,568
Yay!

27
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:11,303
(sighs)

28
00:01:11,305 --> 00:01:14,489
I think I'm gonna take a little
nap before we get there.

29
00:01:14,491 --> 00:01:16,658
Okay.

30
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:18,861
I'm so hungry.

31
00:01:18,863 --> 00:01:20,612
You'll be home soon, and then...

32
00:01:20,614 --> 00:01:23,115
Whoa, that-that
is not food.

33
00:01:24,951 --> 00:01:27,485
Are you sure
you don't want to stay, 'cause

34
00:01:27,487 --> 00:01:29,371
we could have sex?

35
00:01:29,373 --> 00:01:30,789
You've made that
abundantly clear.

36
00:01:30,791 --> 00:01:31,990
Uh, but no, thank you.

37
00:01:31,992 --> 00:01:34,593
And to have sex with me,
you need to be able

38
00:01:34,595 --> 00:01:37,012
to stand on one leg
and touch your nose.

39
00:01:38,882 --> 00:01:40,498
Ooh.

40
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:42,517
Nope.

41
00:01:44,137 --> 00:01:45,304
Okay, let's...

42
00:01:45,306 --> 00:01:47,672
Ooh! Mojito.

43
00:01:47,674 --> 00:01:50,642
Okay, let's-let's
get you inside safe and sound.

44
00:01:50,644 --> 00:01:52,361
Yum.
Mm?

45
00:01:52,363 --> 00:01:53,645
(gasps)

46
00:01:53,647 --> 00:01:55,063
Hello.

47
00:01:55,065 --> 00:01:56,365
Hi, Nana.

48
00:01:56,367 --> 00:01:58,901
Look, this is
my new friend Wal...

49
00:01:58,903 --> 00:02:02,371
(retching)

50
00:02:02,373 --> 00:02:04,856
It's actually pronounced
"Walden."

51
00:02:04,858 --> 00:02:07,525
♪ Men, men, men, men, manly men,
men, men ♪

52
00:02:07,527 --> 00:02:09,779
♪ Ah.
♪ Men.

53
00:02:13,496 --> 00:02:14,879
She's asleep.

54
00:02:15,005 --> 00:02:16,638
Her head's in the toilet,
but she's asleep.

55
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,206
(sighs)

56
00:02:18,208 --> 00:02:20,124
I just... I just wanted
to say I'm sorry.

57
00:02:20,126 --> 00:02:22,543
I'm not the kind of guy
who brings home a drunk girl.

58
00:02:22,545 --> 00:02:25,046
I mean, I did bring her home,
but not to, you know,

59
00:02:25,048 --> 00:02:27,899
bring her home. I...

60
00:02:27,901 --> 00:02:29,584
We met at this video game
release party,

61
00:02:29,586 --> 00:02:30,885
and we started drinking
and talking.

62
00:02:30,887 --> 00:02:32,837
As it turns out, she was doing
more of the drinking,

63
00:02:32,839 --> 00:02:34,305
and I was doing
more of the talking.

64
00:02:34,307 --> 00:02:35,623
And here I am, still talking.

65
00:02:35,625 --> 00:02:37,558
Hi. I'm Walden Schmidt.

66
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:38,793
Nice to meet
you, Walden.

67
00:02:38,795 --> 00:02:40,011
Linda Pearson.

68
00:02:40,013 --> 00:02:41,962
Thank you for helping
my granddaughter.

69
00:02:41,964 --> 00:02:44,298
Your... You do not look
like you're old enough

70
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:45,433
to have a granddaughter.

71
00:02:45,435 --> 00:02:49,570
The unexpected benefit
of being a slut at 18.

72
00:02:50,656 --> 00:02:52,473
And having a daughter
who followed suit.

73
00:02:52,475 --> 00:02:54,359
And, you know, from
the looks of it,

74
00:02:54,361 --> 00:02:58,413
Stacey is, uh, going to carry
on the proud family tradition.

75
00:02:58,415 --> 00:03:01,833
Some families hand down recipes.

76
00:03:01,835 --> 00:03:03,584
I appreciate you
being a gentleman.

77
00:03:03,586 --> 00:03:05,386
Sure. You know,

78
00:03:05,388 --> 00:03:07,372
I was... I was looking
at these photos.

79
00:03:07,374 --> 00:03:09,323
They're amazing. Who took these?

80
00:03:09,325 --> 00:03:10,174
Oh, I did.

81
00:03:10,176 --> 00:03:11,676
You took all of these?

82
00:03:11,678 --> 00:03:13,795
Yeah, I'm a
photographer. In fact,

83
00:03:13,797 --> 00:03:16,330
this is pretty much a record of
the last 40 years of my life.

84
00:03:16,332 --> 00:03:18,533
Well, hold on.
In this one,

85
00:03:18,535 --> 00:03:22,303
these guys are aiming their
machine guns at the camera,

86
00:03:22,305 --> 00:03:24,672
which means they're aiming
their machine guns at you.

87
00:03:24,674 --> 00:03:27,225
Yeah, I was on
assignment, and, uh,

88
00:03:27,227 --> 00:03:29,343
I needed a photo of
Nicaraguan Contras,

89
00:03:29,345 --> 00:03:31,846
and I guess nobody told
their elite death squad

90
00:03:31,848 --> 00:03:33,731
it was picture day.

91
00:03:33,733 --> 00:03:35,400
Wow.

92
00:03:35,402 --> 00:03:38,403
That's what I said when
they came over the hill.

93
00:03:38,405 --> 00:03:40,405
But it had a lot
more Fs in it.

94
00:03:41,874 --> 00:03:45,126
Thi-This is a picture
of Warren Beatty

95
00:03:45,128 --> 00:03:46,160
and Jack Nicholson.

96
00:03:46,162 --> 00:03:47,862
Yeah, I-I took some more photos

97
00:03:47,864 --> 00:03:51,132
in the Jacuzzi later,
but, uh, I can't display those.

98
00:03:52,668 --> 00:03:55,386
Yeah, and that's, um, the
Berlin Wall coming down,

99
00:03:55,388 --> 00:03:57,872
and-and that's
Tiananmen Square,

100
00:03:57,874 --> 00:03:59,841
and this is a dachshund

101
00:03:59,843 --> 00:04:02,477
in a hot dog bun.

102
00:04:02,479 --> 00:04:03,928
You're really talented.

103
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:05,680
(laughing):
You're really sweet.

104
00:04:05,682 --> 00:04:07,548
Okay, yeah, I've taken up
enough of your time.

105
00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:09,183
I'm gonna get out
of your way now.

106
00:04:09,185 --> 00:04:10,551
Oh, you're not in my way.

107
00:04:10,553 --> 00:04:13,938
I was just going to make a cup
of tea and smoke a joint.

108
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:15,990
Really?

109
00:04:15,992 --> 00:04:18,159
Yeah. Uh, you want to join me?

110
00:04:18,161 --> 00:04:20,411
That's my idea
of baking with Grandma.

111
00:04:20,413 --> 00:04:22,597
(laughs)

112
00:04:24,583 --> 00:04:26,567
(door closes)
JAKE: Dad? Walden?

113
00:04:26,569 --> 00:04:29,787
Jake?

114
00:04:30,839 --> 00:04:32,090
This is a surprise.

115
00:04:32,092 --> 00:04:34,041
So is this.

116
00:04:34,043 --> 00:04:36,744
What's on your face?

117
00:04:36,746 --> 00:04:38,245
Oh, uh, now that I'm back
in the dating pool,

118
00:04:38,247 --> 00:04:39,380
I want to look my best.

119
00:04:39,382 --> 00:04:41,883
Oh. It's not working.

120
00:04:41,885 --> 00:04:43,584
So, what-what are
you doing home?

121
00:04:43,586 --> 00:04:45,870
Oh, I got a few days pass,
you know, thought

122
00:04:45,872 --> 00:04:47,638
I'd come surprise you,
spend some time together.

123
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:49,056
That's great.
Wait a second.

124
00:04:49,058 --> 00:04:51,692
Are you in trouble? Is somebody
pregnant? Do you need money?

125
00:04:51,694 --> 00:04:53,728
No, no, and always.

126
00:04:53,730 --> 00:04:56,781
Thing is, I'm gonna be
going away for a while.

127
00:04:56,783 --> 00:04:59,517
Damn it, I forgot jail.

128
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:01,452
Not jail. Japan.

129
00:05:01,454 --> 00:05:02,487
Japan?

130
00:05:02,489 --> 00:05:03,821
Yeah. They needed an extra cook

131
00:05:03,823 --> 00:05:05,790
at the base over there,
so I volunteered.

132
00:05:05,792 --> 00:05:06,991
Really? Why?

133
00:05:06,993 --> 00:05:09,627
Why not?
I love Benihana.

134
00:05:09,629 --> 00:05:11,662
Oh-oh, my God.
W-When do you leave?

135
00:05:11,664 --> 00:05:12,663
Two weeks.

136
00:05:12,665 --> 00:05:13,781
Wait. Two weeks?

137
00:05:13,783 --> 00:05:15,282
So-so this is probably
the last time

138
00:05:15,284 --> 00:05:16,951
I'm going to see you
for a while.

139
00:05:16,953 --> 00:05:19,114
Yeah, I guess, unless you're
willing to make the drive.

140
00:05:22,975 --> 00:05:25,125
So Nixon stands on the
helicopter steps, right,

141
00:05:25,127 --> 00:05:28,513
and he does this,
and I take the picture

142
00:05:28,515 --> 00:05:30,848
and I am so excited
that I don't even notice

143
00:05:30,850 --> 00:05:34,152
Strom Thurmond's hand
is on my ass.

144
00:05:34,154 --> 00:05:35,736
So, what did you do?

145
00:05:35,738 --> 00:05:37,772
I became a lifelong Democrat.

146
00:05:37,774 --> 00:05:39,106
(laughs)

147
00:05:39,108 --> 00:05:41,676
Wow. You've seen
some incredible things.

148
00:05:41,678 --> 00:05:44,679
Oh, well, you can get into
some pretty amazing places

149
00:05:44,681 --> 00:05:47,665
with a camera, a press
pass, and no bra.

150
00:05:47,667 --> 00:05:50,168
Okay, I'm gonna stop
wearing a bra.

151
00:05:50,170 --> 00:05:52,670
You know, it's-it's nice
to have someone to talk to.

152
00:05:52,672 --> 00:05:55,790
Stacey thinks Nicaragua is a
gum you chew to stop smoking.

153
00:05:55,792 --> 00:05:57,041
(laughs)

154
00:05:57,043 --> 00:06:01,746
She also thinks Mount Rushmore
is a natural phenomenon.

155
00:06:01,748 --> 00:06:03,381
It's not?

156
00:06:03,383 --> 00:06:04,348
(laughs)

157
00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:06,834
(laughs)
Oh, man.

158
00:06:06,836 --> 00:06:08,168
I should really get going.

159
00:06:08,170 --> 00:06:10,938
Oh, but before you go,
you have to do something for me.

160
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:12,607
Every person I meet

161
00:06:12,609 --> 00:06:14,442
poses for the same picture.

162
00:06:14,444 --> 00:06:16,060
Oh, I would be honored.

163
00:06:16,062 --> 00:06:18,029
Great. Okay, now,
stand by that wall.

164
00:06:18,031 --> 00:06:19,513
Okay.

165
00:06:19,515 --> 00:06:21,199
Yeah, and, uh,

166
00:06:21,201 --> 00:06:23,017
give me a great big smile.

167
00:06:23,819 --> 00:06:25,653
Now drop your
pants and moon me.

168
00:06:25,655 --> 00:06:28,239
What?
(camera shutter clicks)

169
00:06:28,241 --> 00:06:31,626
That's the picture
I take of everyone.

170
00:06:31,628 --> 00:06:33,377
Okay, I'm still gonna moon you.

171
00:06:37,032 --> 00:06:39,000
So how long is
your tour of duty?

172
00:06:39,002 --> 00:06:41,719
And, yes, I know
I said "duty."

173
00:06:41,721 --> 00:06:45,089
Uh, a year, but if I do
really well, it could be longer.

174
00:06:45,091 --> 00:06:46,540
Okay, so a year.

175
00:06:47,392 --> 00:06:49,110
Hey.

176
00:06:49,112 --> 00:06:50,811
Hey, Walden.

177
00:06:50,813 --> 00:06:52,213
What are you
doing home?

178
00:06:52,215 --> 00:06:53,481
Oh, just visiting.

179
00:06:53,483 --> 00:06:55,349
He's being
transferred to Japan.

180
00:06:55,351 --> 00:06:57,401
Oh, what? That's amazing!

181
00:06:57,403 --> 00:07:00,154
I mean, I'll miss you,
but what a great opportunity.

182
00:07:00,156 --> 00:07:02,023
It's a beautiful country,
gorgeous women,

183
00:07:02,025 --> 00:07:04,742
one step closer
to having this house to myself.

184
00:07:04,744 --> 00:07:06,727
Yeah, the only thing
I'm worried about is,

185
00:07:06,729 --> 00:07:08,996
they still haven't found
Godzilla.

186
00:07:13,735 --> 00:07:16,170
How-how was the party?

187
00:07:16,172 --> 00:07:17,371
Oh, it was great.

188
00:07:17,373 --> 00:07:18,923
I-I met this really hot
22-year-old girl

189
00:07:18,925 --> 00:07:20,925
and spent the whole night
talking to her grandma.

190
00:07:20,927 --> 00:07:23,928
Oh, yeah, "talking
to her grandma."

191
00:07:24,713 --> 00:07:26,597
I know what that means.

192
00:07:32,471 --> 00:07:33,754
Do you?

193
00:07:33,756 --> 00:07:34,939
(scoffs)
Are you kidding?

194
00:07:34,941 --> 00:07:36,440
Whenever I wear my uniform out,

195
00:07:36,442 --> 00:07:39,426
all the ladies let me talk
to their grandma.

196
00:07:45,867 --> 00:07:47,267
I'm just gonna talk to you.

197
00:07:47,269 --> 00:07:49,320
Wait, wait.

198
00:07:49,322 --> 00:07:51,155
So, uh, you met
this hot 22-year-old,

199
00:07:51,157 --> 00:07:53,624
but you spent the night talking
to her grandmother?

200
00:07:53,626 --> 00:07:55,743
That's like going to the
International House of Pancakes

201
00:07:55,745 --> 00:07:57,444
and ordering a bowl of dust.

202
00:07:57,446 --> 00:07:59,714
Okay, clearly, I can't talk
to either of you.

203
00:07:59,716 --> 00:08:01,666
No. No, seriously. Why?

204
00:08:01,668 --> 00:08:05,753
Well, I'm sick of dating
these goofy, shallow girls

205
00:08:05,755 --> 00:08:08,639
that all have a tiny dog
in their purse.

206
00:08:08,641 --> 00:08:12,510
All right,
"tiny dog in their purse."

207
00:08:12,512 --> 00:08:15,730
I'm missing you less and less.

208
00:08:17,766 --> 00:08:19,684
She's really interesting.

209
00:08:19,686 --> 00:08:22,687
Is she like a rapping granny
or something?

210
00:08:22,689 --> 00:08:24,572
Stop talking!

211
00:08:26,274 --> 00:08:27,975
Well, she's smart and funny,

212
00:08:27,977 --> 00:08:29,944
and she's had all
these incredible experiences.

213
00:08:29,946 --> 00:08:31,779
There's just one problem.

214
00:08:31,781 --> 00:08:33,831
What? She can't drive at night?

215
00:08:36,335 --> 00:08:38,769
No. If I want
to see Linda again,

216
00:08:38,771 --> 00:08:41,989
I got to see Stacey again,
and if, if I see her,

217
00:08:41,991 --> 00:08:44,324
she's gonna want
to have sex with me.

218
00:08:50,465 --> 00:08:52,717
Could you ask Walden
why that's a problem?

219
00:08:57,806 --> 00:09:00,141
This is nice, huh?

220
00:09:00,143 --> 00:09:01,525
Yes, it is.

221
00:09:02,778 --> 00:09:04,945
In a truly weird way.

222
00:09:04,947 --> 00:09:06,180
There's nothing weird

223
00:09:06,182 --> 00:09:07,782
about three people
having dinner together.

224
00:09:07,784 --> 00:09:10,568
It is when two of them
are on a date.

225
00:09:10,570 --> 00:09:12,236
Oh, come on. We
want you here.

226
00:09:12,238 --> 00:09:14,238
Isn't that right, Stacey?
Huh?

227
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,874
Yeah. Totes.

228
00:09:16,876 --> 00:09:19,493
Well, in that case,
I'm totes glad to be here.

229
00:09:19,495 --> 00:09:23,197
So, are-are you into
photography, too?

230
00:09:23,199 --> 00:09:26,751
Oh, yeah,
I take tons of selfies!

231
00:09:28,587 --> 00:09:31,138
♪ Instagram!

232
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:32,440
(Stacey chuckles)

233
00:09:32,442 --> 00:09:35,593
So, how did you two wind up
living together?

234
00:09:35,595 --> 00:09:39,430
Ugh. She's my grandma. Duh.

235
00:09:40,766 --> 00:09:42,382
Stacey's looking
for a job out here.

236
00:09:42,384 --> 00:09:44,769
She just graduated
from Arizona State.

237
00:09:44,771 --> 00:09:46,887
Oh, wow. What
was your major?

238
00:09:46,889 --> 00:09:48,272
Communications.

239
00:09:48,274 --> 00:09:51,575
You know, I've always wondered,
what is that exactly?

240
00:09:51,577 --> 00:09:56,247
Well... it's kind of hard
to put into words.

241
00:09:56,249 --> 00:09:58,999
I mean, you know,
it's, like, talking and stuff.

242
00:09:59,001 --> 00:10:01,068
Uh-huh.

243
00:10:01,070 --> 00:10:03,087
120 grand.

244
00:10:03,972 --> 00:10:05,739
Ooh.

245
00:10:05,741 --> 00:10:08,125
Hey, are we gonna
have sex tonight?

246
00:10:08,127 --> 00:10:10,594
There's that
communications degree at work.

247
00:10:10,596 --> 00:10:12,847
(laughs) I hadn't really thought
about it.

248
00:10:12,849 --> 00:10:16,583
'Cause, if not, I just got
invited to a killer party.

249
00:10:17,636 --> 00:10:19,470
Well, I-I wouldn't want
to keep you if...

250
00:10:19,472 --> 00:10:22,273
Great. My friends are gonna
swing by and pick me up.

251
00:10:22,275 --> 00:10:24,642
Okay. Do-do you want
to eat something first?

252
00:10:24,644 --> 00:10:25,976
Oh, God, no.

253
00:10:25,978 --> 00:10:28,145
I hate drinking
on a full stomach.

254
00:10:28,147 --> 00:10:30,981
In fact, I'm gonna go throw up
and make a little room.

255
00:10:33,034 --> 00:10:34,985
Pretty sure she's going
to live with me forever.

256
00:10:34,987 --> 00:10:37,404
I got one of those.

257
00:10:40,742 --> 00:10:43,277
I think pizza's the thing
I'm gonna miss the most

258
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:45,162
when I go to Japan.

259
00:10:45,164 --> 00:10:48,282
Really? Pizza?

260
00:10:48,284 --> 00:10:52,136
Yeah. Well, that and sushi.

261
00:10:53,755 --> 00:10:56,390
Okay. You know what?
This is ridiculous.

262
00:10:56,392 --> 00:10:58,843
I mean, you're-you're
gonna be gone for a year,

263
00:10:58,845 --> 00:11:00,127
and we're sitting
here watching

264
00:11:00,129 --> 00:11:01,729
Dancing with the
Freakin' Stars.

265
00:11:01,731 --> 00:11:04,565
Well, do you want to watch
Hillbilly Gynecologist?

266
00:11:04,567 --> 00:11:06,817
No. No, I don't want
to watch anything.

267
00:11:06,819 --> 00:11:09,820
I want to do something.
Hey, hey, what do you say

268
00:11:09,822 --> 00:11:12,072
we go on a father-son
road trip?

269
00:11:12,074 --> 00:11:14,408
Okay. Can we go to Vegas?

270
00:11:14,410 --> 00:11:16,360
Uh, well, that would be great
except you're not old enough

271
00:11:16,362 --> 00:11:17,411
to drink or gamble.

272
00:11:17,413 --> 00:11:21,332
Right. I don't drink.

273
00:11:21,334 --> 00:11:23,000
Oh, uh, you know
what we could do?

274
00:11:23,002 --> 00:11:26,537
We could see beloved Canadian
songbird Celine Dion.

275
00:11:26,539 --> 00:11:28,873
She is to die for.

276
00:11:29,624 --> 00:11:32,459
Dad?
Mm-hmm.

277
00:11:32,461 --> 00:11:34,762
I'm gonna be going away
for a while.

278
00:11:34,764 --> 00:11:37,882
If there's anything you need
to tell me, now's the time.

279
00:11:40,018 --> 00:11:42,336
Well, thank you
very much for dinner.

280
00:11:42,338 --> 00:11:45,539
You know, I was really impressed
that you ordered in Italian.

281
00:11:45,541 --> 00:11:48,058
Grazie, signora. Molto bene.

282
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:49,310
It would've been more impressive

283
00:11:49,312 --> 00:11:51,478
if we'd been
in an Italian restaurant, but...

284
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:52,780
(both laugh)

285
00:11:52,782 --> 00:11:54,681
I had a great time tonight.

286
00:11:54,683 --> 00:11:56,951
Oh, I did, too. Yeah.

287
00:11:58,103 --> 00:11:59,703
Whoa.

288
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:01,906
Look.

289
00:12:01,908 --> 00:12:04,241
You are a wonderful
young man, but...

290
00:12:04,243 --> 00:12:06,243
I have a rule.

291
00:12:06,245 --> 00:12:08,379
I never kiss anyone
who started the night

292
00:12:08,381 --> 00:12:10,581
on a date with my granddaughter.

293
00:12:13,168 --> 00:12:15,169
A rule?

294
00:12:15,171 --> 00:12:18,372
So this has happened before?

295
00:12:22,922 --> 00:12:25,240
So, what do you think?
If we take this route,

296
00:12:25,242 --> 00:12:28,060
we can be at the Grand Canyon
by sunrise tomorrow.

297
00:12:28,062 --> 00:12:29,094
Pretty awesome, huh?

298
00:12:29,096 --> 00:12:31,430
Yeah. You know what
else is awesome?

299
00:12:31,432 --> 00:12:32,497
The Bunny Ranch.

300
00:12:32,499 --> 00:12:35,050
(sighs) We are not going
to a whorehouse,

301
00:12:35,052 --> 00:12:36,719
we're going
to the Grand Canyon.

302
00:12:36,721 --> 00:12:38,387
There's a girl
at the Bunny Ranch

303
00:12:38,389 --> 00:12:39,805
they call the Grand Canyon.

304
00:12:42,392 --> 00:12:44,342
Morning.

305
00:12:44,344 --> 00:12:45,894
Hey, Walden, we're going
on a father-son trip.

306
00:12:45,896 --> 00:12:46,862
Do you want to come?

307
00:12:46,864 --> 00:12:47,730
Jake!

308
00:12:47,732 --> 00:12:49,932
What? I want it to be fun.

309
00:12:51,334 --> 00:12:53,285
I can't. I'm still
sorting things out

310
00:12:53,287 --> 00:12:54,737
with Linda and Stacey.

311
00:12:54,739 --> 00:12:56,755
Oh, right. The grandma-
granddaughter thing.

312
00:12:56,757 --> 00:12:58,707
You know, if you get
the mom in there,

313
00:12:58,709 --> 00:13:01,727
they'll bronze
your johnson.

314
00:13:01,729 --> 00:13:05,130
I am so glad you're a cook,
not a sniper.

315
00:13:05,999 --> 00:13:08,834
So, Japan, huh?

316
00:13:08,836 --> 00:13:11,653
Yeah, the Big Apple.

317
00:13:11,655 --> 00:13:14,640
(sighs)
Have a fun road trip.

318
00:13:14,642 --> 00:13:17,676
I'm gonna miss this.
Give me a hug.

319
00:13:17,678 --> 00:13:19,478
Thanks for everything, Berta.

320
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:22,181
You take care of
yourself, Taterhead.

321
00:13:22,183 --> 00:13:23,482
Are you crying?

322
00:13:23,484 --> 00:13:24,933
Nah.

323
00:13:24,935 --> 00:13:26,885
Don't worry,
you'll still have my dad.

324
00:13:26,887 --> 00:13:29,154
Now I'm crying.

325
00:13:31,408 --> 00:13:33,575
(doorbell rings)

326
00:13:34,411 --> 00:13:36,078
Hi.

327
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:38,163
Hi. Um, hmm...

328
00:13:38,165 --> 00:13:39,898
Well, this is a little awkward.

329
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:43,202
Um, Stacey's actually
out on a date.

330
00:13:43,204 --> 00:13:45,020
Oh, no. I'm devastated.

331
00:13:45,022 --> 00:13:47,405
I don't think I should be alone.

332
00:13:47,407 --> 00:13:48,791
Look, I'm very flattered,

333
00:13:48,793 --> 00:13:51,126
but I think
we covered this last night.

334
00:13:51,128 --> 00:13:52,344
I brought weed.

335
00:13:53,213 --> 00:13:54,463
(sniffs)

336
00:13:54,465 --> 00:13:56,598
Oh, honey, that's not weed.

337
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:58,267
Come on in.

338
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:02,471
And stop looking at my ass.

339
00:14:03,356 --> 00:14:05,274
Got it.

340
00:14:05,276 --> 00:14:07,893
Isn't this great?
(chuckles)

341
00:14:07,895 --> 00:14:10,362
The Harper boys,
on the road.

342
00:14:10,364 --> 00:14:12,648
Mothers, lock up
your daughters.

343
00:14:12,650 --> 00:14:15,984
Cows, prepare
to be tipped.

344
00:14:15,986 --> 00:14:17,820
Since when do you tip?

345
00:14:17,822 --> 00:14:19,604
(both laugh)

346
00:14:19,606 --> 00:14:20,873
That's witty banter.

347
00:14:20,875 --> 00:14:22,941
Best thing about a road trip.
Yeah, yeah.

348
00:14:22,943 --> 00:14:25,244
That and joking around.

349
00:14:29,382 --> 00:14:31,750
Can I tell you
something?

350
00:14:31,752 --> 00:14:33,085
Of course.

351
00:14:33,970 --> 00:14:35,954
Back when you and Mom broke up,

352
00:14:35,956 --> 00:14:37,473
I thought it was your fault,

353
00:14:37,475 --> 00:14:40,008
and I was kind of mad at you
for a long time.

354
00:14:40,010 --> 00:14:42,294
Oh, Jake, well, it was...

355
00:14:42,296 --> 00:14:45,180
very complicated. You know,
a lot of things got said...

356
00:14:45,182 --> 00:14:47,182
Yeah, well, let me finish.

357
00:14:47,184 --> 00:14:49,401
Then Mom married Herb

358
00:14:49,403 --> 00:14:51,436
and then broke up with him,

359
00:14:51,438 --> 00:14:55,741
so now I'm thinking
maybe it wasn't all you.

360
00:14:55,743 --> 00:14:58,277
Well, I appreciate that.

361
00:14:58,279 --> 00:15:01,997
But I'm not gonna say anything
bad about your mother.

362
00:15:02,866 --> 00:15:04,416
But you're hoping
I will, right?

363
00:15:04,418 --> 00:15:06,618
Oh, absolutely.

364
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:09,788
So, after I dropped out
of college,

365
00:15:09,790 --> 00:15:12,291
me and my buddy developed
this software, and we sold it

366
00:15:12,293 --> 00:15:13,709
for, like, a stupid amount
of money.

367
00:15:13,711 --> 00:15:15,177
And then I lost half of it
in my divorce,

368
00:15:15,179 --> 00:15:17,212
so then I developed some more
software and made it all back,

369
00:15:17,214 --> 00:15:19,431
and I am really freaking high.

370
00:15:20,717 --> 00:15:23,969
I feel like I've been talking
for over a year.

371
00:15:23,971 --> 00:15:26,021
You kind of have.

372
00:15:26,023 --> 00:15:27,556
(chuckles)

373
00:15:27,558 --> 00:15:30,025
So, what do you do now?

374
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:33,195
A lot of this.

375
00:15:33,197 --> 00:15:34,713
Oh, Walden.

376
00:15:34,715 --> 00:15:36,899
You did yo life backwards.

377
00:15:36,901 --> 00:15:38,467
Yeah. You're
supposed to spend

378
00:15:38,469 --> 00:15:41,870
your youth ad-adventurizing.

379
00:15:41,872 --> 00:15:44,189
A-And then you go into business.

380
00:15:44,191 --> 00:15:47,910
Wait. You said "adventurizing."
(laughs)

381
00:15:47,912 --> 00:15:50,245
That's not even a word.

382
00:15:50,247 --> 00:15:52,497
It is now. I just...

383
00:15:52,499 --> 00:15:54,082
inventorized it.

384
00:15:54,084 --> 00:15:55,801
(both laugh)

385
00:15:55,803 --> 00:15:58,470
No, I mean it.
I mean it. You...

386
00:15:58,472 --> 00:16:02,975
you need to find something...
exciting in your life.

387
00:16:02,977 --> 00:16:04,343
Like what?

388
00:16:04,345 --> 00:16:07,712
Have you ever been chased
by a lion in the Serengeti?

389
00:16:07,714 --> 00:16:10,649
No. But one time
I got in a slap fight

390
00:16:10,651 --> 00:16:12,401
with the guy who plays Simba
at Disneyland.

391
00:16:12,403 --> 00:16:13,602
(chuckles)

392
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:15,938
That counts.

393
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:17,155
(laughs)

394
00:16:17,157 --> 00:16:20,692
H-Have you ever been
at a voodoo ritual in Haiti?

395
00:16:20,694 --> 00:16:23,662
Or-or-or panned for gold
in the Yukon?

396
00:16:23,664 --> 00:16:26,448
Or... (gasps)
made out with Buzz Aldrin?

397
00:16:26,450 --> 00:16:29,117
Ooh, do I want to make out
with Buzz Aldrin?

398
00:16:29,119 --> 00:16:30,369
Oh, yeah.

402
00:16:35,125 --> 00:16:38,126
and then you
just... do it.

403
00:16:39,012 --> 00:16:40,596
Yeah, maybe you're right.

404
00:16:40,598 --> 00:16:41,797

I'm sorry.

408
00:16:48,822 --> 00:16:52,941
No, no, no, no. This is...
This one's on me. Um...

409
00:16:52,943 --> 00:16:55,593
No, I haven't been with anybody
since my divorce,

410
00:16:55,595 --> 00:16:57,312
and that was three years ago.

411
00:16:57,314 --> 00:16:59,197

You're a beautiful woman.

00:17:00,868 --> 00:17:02,818
No, I was a mess. I...

414
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:06,822
I was faithful to one man
for over 30 years, and...

415
00:17:06,824 --> 00:17:10,275
unfortunately he was only
faithful for six months and...

416
00:17:10,277 --> 00:17:14,162
(sighs)
not in a row.

417
00:17:15,665 --> 00:17:21,503

for philanderizing.

We lived at a beach house
my whole life, rent-free.

And then, even
after Uncle Charlie died,

463
00:19:23,177 --> 00:19:24,409
we managed to stay there.

I mean, who else
could have done that?

465
00:19:26,430 --> 00:19:29,181
I did always make sure you
had a roof over your head.

Even if it was
someone else's.

467

Yeah, you did.

468
00:19:32,886 --> 00:19:35,053
And there were a lot
of hot chicks under that roof.
