1
00:00:01,343 --> 00:00:03,653
Previously, on...

2
00:00:03,753 --> 00:00:04,488
H-Hello?

3
00:00:04,489 --> 00:00:06,756
Hey, Dad. Uh, this is
my girlfriend, Tammy.

4
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:08,873
Uh, Tammy,
this is my dad Alan.

5
00:00:08,874 --> 00:00:10,175
It's a pleasure
to meet you.

6
00:00:10,177 --> 00:00:11,259
How'd you two meet?

7
00:00:11,261 --> 00:00:12,644
A couple of us guys
from the base

8
00:00:12,646 --> 00:00:14,429
went out drinking, and they
bet me a hundred bucks

9
00:00:14,431 --> 00:00:15,963
that I wouldn't get
this tattoo of two arms

10
00:00:15,965 --> 00:00:17,148
coming out of
my butt crack.

11
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:18,433
Oh, Jake, you didn't.

12
00:00:18,435 --> 00:00:21,102
No, Tammy wouldn't let me.
Thank you for that.

13
00:00:21,104 --> 00:00:23,104
I took one look
at his ass and I thought,

14
00:00:23,106 --> 00:00:25,857
I don't want to tattoo that,
I want to bite that.

15
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:27,776
She's old enough
to have you as her kid.

16
00:00:27,778 --> 00:00:29,160
So what? You are, too.

17
00:00:29,162 --> 00:00:31,196
I-I don't understand
why you're with Jake.

18
00:00:31,198 --> 00:00:33,648
The bottom line is,
I think your son is terrific.

19
00:00:33,650 --> 00:00:35,834
And I know what we have
isn't gonna last forever,

20
00:00:35,836 --> 00:00:37,952
but it's what I want
in my life right now.

21
00:00:37,954 --> 00:00:40,121
And I don't know when
the last time you had sex

22
00:00:40,123 --> 00:00:44,175
with a 19-year-old boy was,
but it is a lot of fun.

23
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:48,713
What a nice surprise

24
00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:50,515
to have you home
for the weekend.

25
00:00:50,517 --> 00:00:52,050
Well, it's good
to be home.

26
00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:56,471
Okay. I hate to be the one
to break up this happy reunion,

27
00:00:56,473 --> 00:01:00,341
but you both do realize
this is not your home.

28
00:01:00,343 --> 00:01:02,527
(chuckles)
He's cute.

29
00:01:02,529 --> 00:01:05,179
He really is, though.

30
00:01:05,181 --> 00:01:06,748
ALAN: So, uh,
so what's going on?

31
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:08,015
Anything new in the Army?

32
00:01:08,017 --> 00:01:09,401
Oh, did I tell you
I got promoted?

33
00:01:09,403 --> 00:01:11,202
I'm in charge of three
other guys in the kitchen now.

34
00:01:11,204 --> 00:01:13,154
Wow! My son the leader.

35
00:01:13,156 --> 00:01:15,523
Yeah, it's awesome.
They have to do whatever I say.

36
00:01:15,525 --> 00:01:18,710
I made this one guy
chug a tray of hot dog water.

37
00:01:20,196 --> 00:01:21,296
Uh, why would you do that?

38
00:01:21,298 --> 00:01:23,364
It's called
earning respect, Dad.

39
00:01:23,366 --> 00:01:24,749
I-I don't understand.

40
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:26,885
Which part?
Earning or respect?

41
00:01:26,887 --> 00:01:29,254
Bazinga.

42
00:01:33,159 --> 00:01:35,310
Uh, it's from a TV show.

43
00:01:35,312 --> 00:01:37,812
So, uh, how are things
with you and Tammy?

44
00:01:37,814 --> 00:01:39,681
Actually, we broke up.

45
00:01:40,716 --> 00:01:42,233
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.
What happened?

46
00:01:42,235 --> 00:01:43,818
We just decided
it wasn't gonna work out.

47
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:45,720
We had
unrecognizable differences.

48
00:01:45,722 --> 00:01:49,390
Uh, u-unrecognizable
differences?

49
00:01:49,392 --> 00:01:51,025
Yeah, you know,
when you can't see

50
00:01:51,027 --> 00:01:53,912
what the problem is, but you
just have to break up anyway.

51
00:01:53,914 --> 00:01:55,613
(doorbell rings)

52
00:01:55,615 --> 00:01:58,950
Somehow that actually
makes sense.

53
00:01:58,952 --> 00:02:00,418
So, are you doing okay?

54
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:02,337
I know breakups can be hard.

55
00:02:02,339 --> 00:02:04,956
Yeah, it actually helps
to focus on my career.

56
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:07,241
Get this— one time
I made the guys

57
00:02:07,243 --> 00:02:09,878
stick their things in pudding.

58
00:02:13,098 --> 00:02:17,068
They must respect you so much.

59
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,354
Tammy.

60
00:02:19,356 --> 00:02:20,855
Where the hell is he?

61
00:02:20,857 --> 00:02:22,340
I assume that you're talking...

62
00:02:22,342 --> 00:02:24,609
Jake!

63
00:02:24,611 --> 00:02:25,860
Uh-oh, uh-oh.
Get back here,

64
00:02:25,862 --> 00:02:26,978
you son of a bitch!

65
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:29,197
I am gonna kill you!

66
00:02:35,454 --> 00:02:39,240
I sense that he didn't
tell us everything.

JAKE: Let...
let go of me!

75
00:03:09,453 --> 00:03:10,903
Am I hurting you?
No.

76
00:03:10,905 --> 00:03:12,972
How about now?
Ow, ow, ow.

77
00:03:12,974 --> 00:03:14,590
Wait, what-what
the hell is going on?

78
00:03:14,592 --> 00:03:15,708
Tell them.

79
00:03:15,710 --> 00:03:19,111
Um, I broke up with Tammy
to see another girl.

80
00:03:19,113 --> 00:03:20,379
Oh, well, you know,

81
00:03:20,381 --> 00:03:21,797
sometimes relationships
run their course...

82
00:03:21,799 --> 00:03:23,082
Tell them who it was.

83
00:03:23,084 --> 00:03:24,216
I don't think
they really...

84
00:03:24,218 --> 00:03:26,285
Tell them!
Ow!

85
00:03:26,287 --> 00:03:28,454
It was her daughter.

86
00:03:30,173 --> 00:03:34,143
Wait, wait, y-you slept
with your girlfriend's daughter?

87
00:03:34,978 --> 00:03:36,145
Jerry Springer is taped

88
00:03:36,147 --> 00:03:38,481
before a live
studio audience.

89
00:03:38,483 --> 00:03:41,867
I trusted you to be a
good influence on Ashley.

90
00:03:41,869 --> 00:03:45,504
You know, it was your idea
for us to spend time together.

91
00:03:45,506 --> 00:03:48,240
You were supposed to be
tutoring her in math!

92
00:03:48,242 --> 00:03:49,675
What were you thinking?

93
00:03:51,661 --> 00:03:52,811
Jake tutoring math?

94
00:03:52,813 --> 00:03:55,114
What were you thinking?

95
00:03:55,116 --> 00:03:57,032
I figured you were gonna
find another girl someday.

96
00:03:57,034 --> 00:03:58,584
I just didn't
think it would be

97
00:03:58,586 --> 00:04:00,252
the one that came
from my uterus.

98
00:04:00,254 --> 00:04:02,838
I'm sorry,
it just sort of happened.

99
00:04:03,423 --> 00:04:04,590
Ow!

100
00:04:04,592 --> 00:04:07,543
Sorry, it just
sort of happened.

101
00:04:07,545 --> 00:04:09,094
Jake, did you even once consider

102
00:04:09,096 --> 00:04:10,662
that there were
other people involved?

103
00:04:10,664 --> 00:04:12,882
Yeah, of course. I mean,
that's what made it so hot.

104
00:04:12,884 --> 00:04:14,350
Her mom was in the other room.

105
00:04:14,352 --> 00:04:15,868
That's it,
I'm killing him!

106
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:16,869
Dad! Dad!

107
00:04:16,871 --> 00:04:19,054
(chanting):
Jerry! Jerry! Jerry!

108
00:04:21,308 --> 00:04:23,976
Okay, walk me through this.

109
00:04:23,978 --> 00:04:25,444
Start from the beginning.

110
00:04:25,446 --> 00:04:28,514
Well, by all accounts,
I was a happy baby.

111
00:04:28,516 --> 00:04:30,733
Fast-forward.

112
00:04:30,735 --> 00:04:32,985
You and Tammy's daughter.

113
00:04:32,987 --> 00:04:34,203
How?

114
00:04:34,205 --> 00:04:35,538
All right.

115
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:38,741
Imagine Tammy at 18,
in a string bikini,

116
00:04:38,743 --> 00:04:40,459
crying on your shoulder,
saying,

117
00:04:40,461 --> 00:04:42,962
"Why can't all guys
be like you?"

118
00:04:50,287 --> 00:04:51,887
Walden?

119
00:04:52,656 --> 00:04:55,641
Oh, sorry,
I was still imagining.

120
00:04:55,643 --> 00:04:58,093
It was the perfect storm.

121
00:04:58,095 --> 00:05:00,513
Ashley, had just broken up
with her boyfriend

122
00:05:00,515 --> 00:05:01,880
and Tammy was asleep.

123
00:05:01,882 --> 00:05:03,715
I'm the victim here.

124
00:05:09,823 --> 00:05:11,440
Okay, I...

125
00:05:11,442 --> 00:05:15,060
On one hand,
your behavior is despicable.

126
00:05:15,062 --> 00:05:16,395
On the other,

127
00:05:16,397 --> 00:05:19,081
the elusive mother-daughter
combo. Up top.

128
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:22,785
But... (sighs)

129
00:05:22,787 --> 00:05:24,420
last time you were
here, you were saying

130
00:05:24,422 --> 00:05:26,071
that Tammy was the
love of your life

131
00:05:26,073 --> 00:05:27,406
and you wanted
to marry her.

132
00:05:27,408 --> 00:05:30,909
What can I say?
I was young and naive back then.

133
00:05:30,911 --> 00:05:33,846
That was six
weeks ago.

134
00:05:33,848 --> 00:05:35,681
I never meant to hurt Tammy.

135
00:05:35,683 --> 00:05:37,182
I care about them both.

136
00:05:38,885 --> 00:05:41,136
Hey, do you think
there would ever be a chance

137
00:05:41,138 --> 00:05:42,688
I could
get them both together...

138
00:05:48,278 --> 00:05:50,095
You're adorable.

139
00:05:53,984 --> 00:05:56,402
What the hell
is wrong with your son?

140
00:05:56,404 --> 00:05:59,455
That is a question for the ages.

141
00:05:59,457 --> 00:06:01,790
Kind of like,
"If there really is a God,

142
00:06:01,792 --> 00:06:04,159
why is there so much sorrow
in the world?"

143
00:06:04,161 --> 00:06:05,794
or, "How have I managed

144
00:06:05,796 --> 00:06:08,380
to keep living in this house
all these years?"

145
00:06:08,382 --> 00:06:10,833
You know, I'm tempted to sleep
with you just to get back

146
00:06:10,835 --> 00:06:11,800
at him.

147
00:06:11,802 --> 00:06:13,168
(gasping)

148
00:06:13,170 --> 00:06:16,088
Oh, well, I'm, uh,
I'm, uh, I'm flattered,

149
00:06:16,090 --> 00:06:17,306
but I actually...

150
00:06:17,308 --> 00:06:18,924
I was just kidding.

151
00:06:19,959 --> 00:06:22,628
(sighs) How could
he do this to me?

152
00:06:22,630 --> 00:06:24,096
Well, you said yourself,

153
00:06:24,098 --> 00:06:26,649
you knew this thing with
Jake wasn't gonna last.

154
00:06:26,651 --> 00:06:27,633
Yeah, but there are plenty

155
00:06:27,635 --> 00:06:29,068
of other little skanks
in our town.

156
00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:30,819
Why did he have
to pick my little skank?

157
00:06:30,821 --> 00:06:34,857
I wish there was something that
would make you feel better.

158
00:06:34,859 --> 00:06:36,992
Uh, what if
Jake apologized?

159
00:06:36,994 --> 00:06:38,994
What if I cut his balls off?

160
00:06:38,996 --> 00:06:41,647
So, we've got options.

161
00:06:46,086 --> 00:06:47,486
All right, you two,

162
00:06:47,488 --> 00:06:49,355
now-now, let's, uh,
let's think of the couch

163
00:06:49,357 --> 00:06:52,224
as a safe place
for communication.

164
00:06:52,226 --> 00:06:56,095
Uh, uh, neutral corner,
neutral corner.

165
00:06:56,097 --> 00:06:58,681
Now, and-and this,
uh, this pillow

166
00:06:58,683 --> 00:07:01,600
represents the wall of respect.

167
00:07:03,853 --> 00:07:06,555
Okay, I'm gonna, I'm gonna
place it between the two of you.

168
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,441
Okay?

169
00:07:09,443 --> 00:07:11,143
Now, uh, Tammy, would you like

170
00:07:11,145 --> 00:07:13,028
to start?

171
00:07:13,030 --> 00:07:14,697
Hey! Hey!

172
00:07:14,699 --> 00:07:17,149
She hit me
with the wall of respect.

173
00:07:17,151 --> 00:07:19,234
And you slept with my daughter.

174
00:07:19,236 --> 00:07:20,969
So we'll call it even?

175
00:07:21,588 --> 00:07:22,705
Hey!

176
00:07:22,707 --> 00:07:24,490
What's going on?

177
00:07:24,492 --> 00:07:26,659
Oh, well,
it's complicated.

178
00:07:26,661 --> 00:07:28,293
Uh, remember
Jake's girlfriend Tammy?

179
00:07:28,295 --> 00:07:29,294
Yeah.

180
00:07:29,296 --> 00:07:31,497
She has
an 18-year-old daughter...

181
00:07:31,499 --> 00:07:33,632
And Jake nailed her.

182
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:39,388
Okay, not
that complicated.

183
00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:41,890
Uh, Jake,
do you want to say something?

184
00:07:41,892 --> 00:07:43,275
All right.

185
00:07:43,277 --> 00:07:46,395
Uh, I'm sorry for cheating
on you with your daughter.

186
00:07:46,397 --> 00:07:48,180
But, I mean,

187
00:07:48,182 --> 00:07:50,549
when you think about it,
it's really a compliment.

188
00:07:50,551 --> 00:07:53,068
'Cause she's just
a much younger version of you.

189
00:07:55,722 --> 00:07:56,739
(doorbell rings)

190
00:07:56,741 --> 00:07:58,774
I'll get that.
I'll get that.

191
00:07:58,776 --> 00:08:00,776
I didn't know
Jake had it in him.

192
00:08:00,778 --> 00:08:03,829
Apparently, he's had
it in everybody.

193
00:08:05,031 --> 00:08:05,864
Ashley?

194
00:08:05,866 --> 00:08:08,233
Baby!

195
00:08:08,235 --> 00:08:09,868
Get your mouth off my daughter

196
00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:11,537
you cheating
son of a bitch!

197
00:08:11,539 --> 00:08:14,673
Oh, that would make
a great country song.

198
00:08:16,092 --> 00:08:17,593
Ashley, what are you doing here?

199
00:08:17,595 --> 00:08:20,629
Mom, I know you're upset
and that's why I came, but...

200
00:08:20,631 --> 00:08:22,181
Hey, is that my shirt?

201
00:08:22,183 --> 00:08:24,049
Hey, is that my boyfriend?

202
00:08:24,051 --> 00:08:25,417
Oh, please!

203
00:08:25,419 --> 00:08:27,603
Like you haven't stolen
boyfriends from me before.

204
00:08:27,605 --> 00:08:29,521
He was your teacher!

205
00:08:29,523 --> 00:08:31,774
Yeah, and thanks to you,
I failed biology.

206
00:08:31,776 --> 00:08:33,308
No, biology failed me!

207
00:08:33,310 --> 00:08:34,860
(gasps)

208
00:08:34,862 --> 00:08:39,064
This makes me
so homesick.

209
00:08:39,066 --> 00:08:40,199
Come on, Mom.

210
00:08:40,201 --> 00:08:42,317
No, Ashley, I am
not gonna let you

211
00:08:42,319 --> 00:08:43,986
throw your life away
for this loser.

212
00:08:43,988 --> 00:08:46,155
Hey, hey, that
loser is my son.

213
00:08:46,157 --> 00:08:47,439
And your ex-boyfriend.

214
00:08:47,441 --> 00:08:49,041
Yeah, I was
just having fun.

215
00:08:49,043 --> 00:08:50,743
Ashley needs to think
about her future.

216
00:08:50,745 --> 00:08:52,611
Hey... he has
a very bright...

217
00:08:53,646 --> 00:08:57,166
You know what, this
is family business.

218
00:08:57,168 --> 00:08:58,667
You are not
the boss of me.

219
00:08:58,669 --> 00:09:01,220
If I want to date a
loser, then I will.

220
00:09:01,222 --> 00:09:03,255
Thank you.

221

Yeah.

Why did you hit me?

229

Because I can't hit a kid.

What are you

00:09:58,957 --> 00:10:00,123
That's right, son.

243
00:10:00,125 --> 00:10:01,758
No credit, no problem.

244
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:02,843

"Want a Caddy, I'm your Daddy."

246
00:10:05,130 --> 00:10:06,930

Too little, too late, Jer-Bear.

249
00:10:15,107 --> 00:10:16,606
Yeah, Jer-Bear.

250
00:10:17,859 --> 00:10:19,776
You know, it's like that
old song: "If you liked it,

251
00:10:19,778 --> 00:10:21,328
then you should've put
a ring on it."

252
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:23,380
Well, I bought you a belly ring.

253
00:10:23,382 --> 00:10:24,981
Oh, that was you?

254
00:10:24,983 --> 00:10:28,118
I chipped my tooth
on that thing.

255
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:29,936
Uh, just out of curiosity,

256
00:10:29,938 --> 00:10:33,206
how did you meet
Hannah Montana here?

257
00:10:34,292 --> 00:10:35,825
It's actually a cute story.

258
00:10:35,827 --> 00:10:37,377
We were shooting a commercial

259
00:10:37,379 --> 00:10:39,746
for our Fourth of July
Savings Spectacular.

260
00:10:39,748 --> 00:10:41,248
I was dressed as Uncle Sam,

261
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:43,383
with a row of pretty girls
behind me

262
00:10:43,385 --> 00:10:45,418
wearing bikinis
and waving sparklers.

263
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:47,053
I took one look at Ashley,

264
00:10:47,055 --> 00:10:51,007
pointed at her and said,
"Uncle Sam wants you."

265
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:55,011
That is a cute story.

266
00:10:55,013 --> 00:10:58,231
Fireworks went off in
my pants that night.

267
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:02,352
Okay, not so
cute anymore.

268
00:11:02,354 --> 00:11:05,188
I mean, how can you not love
a girl like this?

269
00:11:05,190 --> 00:11:07,574
She's smart, she's funny,
and she's got a better body

270
00:11:07,576 --> 00:11:10,643
than the new SRX Crossover.
Don't you, darling?

271
00:11:10,645 --> 00:11:12,963
Don't "darling" me. You had
your chance and you blew it.

272
00:11:12,965 --> 00:11:15,615
Oh, come on, Ashley.
I've been married four times.

273
00:11:15,617 --> 00:11:17,701
And you know
why they didn't work.

274
00:11:17,703 --> 00:11:19,119
I got a mistress,

275
00:11:19,121 --> 00:11:23,373
and her name
is Customer Satisfaction.

276
00:11:23,375 --> 00:11:24,874
All right.

277
00:11:24,876 --> 00:11:27,460
Look, Jerry, if my little girl
doesn't want to see you,

278
00:11:27,462 --> 00:11:28,661
then you got to go.

279
00:11:28,663 --> 00:11:31,264
Thanks, Mom.
Shut up.

280
00:11:32,133 --> 00:11:34,167
Okay.

281
00:11:34,169 --> 00:11:36,469
It takes two
to make a deal.

282
00:11:36,471 --> 00:11:39,139
But know this, Ashley:

283
00:11:39,141 --> 00:11:42,892
I guarantee
I will always love you.

284
00:11:42,894 --> 00:11:47,447

no one can beat my prices.

Maybe.

292
00:12:20,732 --> 00:12:23,733
My beautiful young daughter
has narrowed her choices down

293
00:12:23,735 --> 00:12:28,355
to a 19-year-old who needs
to ask the Wizard for a brain

294
00:12:28,357 --> 00:12:29,939
and a sleazy car salesman

295
00:12:29,941 --> 00:12:34,077
who barely escaped
a Dateline special.

296
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:36,613
O-Okay, so it's not
an ideal situation,

297
00:12:36,615 --> 00:12:38,581
but... what is?

298
00:12:38,583 --> 00:12:40,283
Sometimes kids
make mistakes.

299
00:12:40,285 --> 00:12:42,836
Yeah, sometimes kids
are mistakes.

300
00:12:44,505 --> 00:12:46,089
Well, look,
when I was a kid,

301
00:12:46,091 --> 00:12:48,408
I made a lot of choices
my parents didn't agree with.

302
00:12:48,410 --> 00:12:51,511
Like dropping out of M.I.T.,
and that turned out great.

303
00:12:51,513 --> 00:12:52,545
(chuckles)

304
00:12:52,547 --> 00:12:53,763
Somehow I don't think

305
00:12:53,765 --> 00:12:56,416
Ashley's on the road
to incredible wealth.

306
00:12:56,418 --> 00:12:58,601
She's more on the road

307
00:12:58,603 --> 00:13:01,938
to antibiotic-resistant
gonorrhea.

308
00:13:03,941 --> 00:13:06,026
Wow.

309
00:13:06,028 --> 00:13:08,478
That's... just...

310
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:11,197
Wow.

311
00:13:12,033 --> 00:13:14,100
When is it gonna stop?

312
00:13:14,102 --> 00:13:15,819
When's what gonna stop?

313
00:13:15,821 --> 00:13:17,037
The taking.

314
00:13:17,039 --> 00:13:19,456
I mean, that's all
kids ever do.

315
00:13:19,458 --> 00:13:21,958
I mean, first they
take over your body

316
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:24,294
like a little parasite.

317
00:13:24,296 --> 00:13:27,613
And then they trash your
fun zone on the way out.

318
00:13:30,584 --> 00:13:32,502
Then they suck your boobs
until your nipples

319
00:13:32,504 --> 00:13:35,621
look like the worn-out thumb
on a work glove.

320
00:13:37,508 --> 00:13:40,393
You do paint a picture
with your words.

321
00:13:41,412 --> 00:13:43,796
And then it
gets really bad.

322
00:13:43,798 --> 00:13:47,067
They take your
sleep, your time,

323
00:13:47,069 --> 00:13:50,520
your favorite dress,
keys to your car,

324
00:13:50,522 --> 00:13:52,772
the weed you had hidden
in a cowboy boot

325
00:13:52,774 --> 00:13:55,191
in the back of
your closet.

326
00:13:55,193 --> 00:13:57,410
Leave it up to my daughter
to go the extra mile

327
00:13:57,412 --> 00:13:58,644
and take my boyfriend.

328
00:13:58,646 --> 00:14:01,030
And you know
why you keep giving?

329
00:14:01,032 --> 00:14:03,700
Because I'm a glutton
for punishment?

330
00:14:03,702 --> 00:14:06,252
Because you love her, and
you want what's best for her.

331
00:14:06,254 --> 00:14:08,321
I suppose.

332
00:14:08,323 --> 00:14:11,040
Okay, let me ask you this:
were you happy with Jake?

333
00:14:11,042 --> 00:14:12,492
I mean, you know,

334
00:14:12,494 --> 00:14:15,295
before he started
climbing the family tree.

335
00:14:17,164 --> 00:14:19,799
Honestly, Jake's
a great guy.

336
00:14:19,801 --> 00:14:22,685
So isn't it possible

337
00:14:22,687 --> 00:14:25,805
that he may also be a great guy
for your daughter?

338
00:14:25,807 --> 00:14:26,973
No.

339
00:14:26,975 --> 00:14:28,475
Yes.

340
00:14:28,477 --> 00:14:29,642
Maybe.

341
00:14:32,379 --> 00:14:35,698
Really? The thumb
on a work glove?

342
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:37,700
Oh, honey, that was
two boob jobs ago.

343
00:14:37,702 --> 00:14:40,987
These puppies can
cut glass now.

344
00:14:51,365 --> 00:14:52,866
Sorry Jerry
hit you, Dad.

345
00:14:52,868 --> 00:14:55,001
So am I.

346
00:14:55,003 --> 00:14:57,170
Yeah, what was that about?
I mean, he won't hit a kid,

347
00:14:57,172 --> 00:14:59,872
but he'll hit somebody
way older than him?

348
00:15:00,707 --> 00:15:02,041
What?

349
00:15:02,043 --> 00:15:04,711
(loudly):
I said, "He won't hit a kid,

350
00:15:04,713 --> 00:15:08,264
but he'll hit someone
way older than him!"

351
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:11,184
Hey.

352
00:15:11,186 --> 00:15:13,570
(clears throat)

353
00:15:13,572 --> 00:15:15,522
(sighs)

354
00:15:15,524 --> 00:15:17,890
I have something
I want to say to you two.

355
00:15:17,892 --> 00:15:19,242
Don't care.

356
00:15:19,244 --> 00:15:22,362
I swear to God, Ashley, I paid
to get those teeth straight,

357
00:15:22,364 --> 00:15:23,696
I will crooked 'em up again!

358
00:15:23,698 --> 00:15:25,482
WALDEN:
Up-bup-bup-bup.

359
00:15:25,484 --> 00:15:28,067
Eye on the ball, Tammy.
Eye on the ball.

360
00:15:30,421 --> 00:15:33,089
If you two want
to be with each other,

361
00:15:33,091 --> 00:15:35,175
I am not gonna stand
in your way.

362
00:15:35,177 --> 00:15:36,192
Really?

363
00:15:36,194 --> 00:15:37,927
If you think you can
be happy together,

364
00:15:37,929 --> 00:15:39,078
then be happy together.

365
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:41,164
Wow. Thank you, Tammy.

366
00:15:41,166 --> 00:15:44,017
I... guess I just
hope Ashley and I

367
00:15:44,019 --> 00:15:47,020
can be as happy as
you and I were.

368
00:15:50,191 --> 00:15:51,891
Stop talking.

369
00:15:53,761 --> 00:15:56,112
But I already am happy,
Jake-Bear.

370
00:15:56,114 --> 00:15:58,431
Give me some sugar.

371
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:03,102
This is the oddest family moment
I have ever witnessed.

372
00:16:03,104 --> 00:16:04,737
(doorbell rings)

373
00:16:06,657 --> 00:16:08,741
Maybe I should
grease up a pig

374
00:16:08,743 --> 00:16:11,127
in case they want
to wrestle later.

375
00:16:14,465 --> 00:16:15,415
Jerry.

376
00:16:15,417 --> 00:16:17,550
(sighs)
I feel bad about before,

377
00:16:17,552 --> 00:16:21,387
so I brought you an official
Jerry's Cadillac beer koozie.

378
00:16:23,307 --> 00:16:24,924
I told you, it's over.

379
00:16:24,926 --> 00:16:26,976
You did.

380
00:16:26,978 --> 00:16:28,961
But I'm driving home

381
00:16:28,963 --> 00:16:31,964
in my limited edition
Escalade...

382
00:16:35,569 --> 00:16:37,520
when it hits me.

383
00:16:37,522 --> 00:16:40,773
If I've learned one thing
in my 25 years

384
00:16:40,775 --> 00:16:43,159
as Orange County's
number one dealer

385
00:16:43,161 --> 00:16:45,111
of premium
luxury vehicles,

386
00:16:45,113 --> 00:16:47,914
it's that you don't take no
for an answer.

387
00:16:47,916 --> 00:16:50,583
God, this guy's good.

388
00:16:50,585 --> 00:16:53,169
So I came back here
to ask you just

389
00:16:53,171 --> 00:16:54,387
one question.

390
00:16:54,389 --> 00:16:56,773
(gasps)

391
00:16:56,775 --> 00:17:00,326
What's it gonna take to get you
into my life today?

392
00:17:01,378 --> 00:17:03,346
Oh, my God,
look at the size of that rock.

393
00:17:03,348 --> 00:17:06,599
Dude, you can't buy her love
with a diamond ring.

394
00:17:06,601 --> 00:17:08,351
But wait, there's more.

395
00:17:10,521 --> 00:17:14,674
My manager's gonna kill me,
but if you say yes right now...

396
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:20,196
I will throw in a 2012
powder blue Mercedes SL

397
00:17:20,198 --> 00:17:22,782
I just bought
at a police auction.

398
00:17:24,451 --> 00:17:26,352
I don't know what to do.

399
00:17:26,354 --> 00:17:29,689
ALAN and TAMMY:
Take the car!

400
00:17:29,691 --> 00:17:30,790
Dad!

401
00:17:30,792 --> 00:17:32,692
It's a Mercedes.

402
00:17:33,827 --> 00:17:35,295
We got a deal, Ashley?

403
00:17:35,297 --> 00:17:37,463
Sold!

404
00:17:37,465 --> 00:17:40,166
OTHERS:
Aw...

405
00:17:40,168 --> 00:17:42,418
Ew!

406
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:45,037
I love these people.

407
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:47,340
♪ Men. ♪

408
00:17:51,505 --> 00:17:53,306
(knocking, door opens)

409
00:17:53,308 --> 00:17:54,958
Jake?

410
00:17:57,428 --> 00:17:59,128
Doing okay?

411
00:17:59,130 --> 00:18:00,730
I guess.

412
00:18:00,732 --> 00:18:03,449
I really screwed things up
this time, didn't I?

413
00:18:03,451 --> 00:18:05,134
Well...

414
00:18:05,136 --> 00:18:08,137
you certainly screwed
everything you could.

415
00:18:08,139 --> 00:18:10,173
I mean, I had
such a good thing going—

416
00:18:10,175 --> 00:18:12,342
first with Tammy
and then Ashley—

417
00:18:12,344 --> 00:18:14,711
and now I'm all alone.

418
00:18:14,713 --> 00:18:16,646
That's because you're a Harper.

419
00:18:16,648 --> 00:18:18,064
It's what we do.

420
00:18:18,066 --> 00:18:21,317
We take something good
and turn it into nothing.

421
00:18:22,186 --> 00:18:24,053
I don't like being a Harper.

422
00:18:24,055 --> 00:18:25,972
Nobody does, son.

423
00:18:25,974 --> 00:18:28,140
Nobody does.

424
00:18:34,114 --> 00:18:35,748
What a day, huh?

425
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:37,283
Yeah.

426
00:18:37,285 --> 00:18:38,868
Sorry about all the trouble.

427
00:18:38,870 --> 00:18:40,520
Oh. You kidding me?

428
00:18:40,522 --> 00:18:42,872
Jerry sold me an Escalade
at dealer cost.

429
00:18:42,874 --> 00:18:45,792
Oh, honey, you didn't
fall for that, did you?

430
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:49,595
He really is the king,
isn't he?

431
00:18:50,431 --> 00:18:52,849
And my daughter gets
to be the queen.

432
00:18:52,851 --> 00:18:55,718
It's a white trash fairy tale.

433
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:57,687
Hey. Let's talk
about something happier.

434
00:18:57,689 --> 00:18:59,772
Remember when Alan
got punched in the face?

435
00:18:59,774 --> 00:19:03,009
(laughing):
Yeah. That was awesome.

436
00:19:04,194 --> 00:19:06,529
Mmm. (chuckles)
(sighs)

437
00:19:06,531 --> 00:19:08,948
You know, the older I get,

438
00:19:08,950 --> 00:19:11,701
the less I understand
about relationships.

439
00:19:11,703 --> 00:19:13,987
Me, too. I'm like a blind man

440
00:19:13,989 --> 00:19:16,472
trying to get out
of a doorknob factory.

441
00:19:16,474 --> 00:19:19,208
I mean, how is
that possible?

442
00:19:19,210 --> 00:19:22,078
I mean, you're handsome
and smart and charming...

443
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:24,030
You're embarrassing me.

444
00:19:24,032 --> 00:19:26,082
Go on.

445
00:19:26,084 --> 00:19:28,051
I mean, you got
the whole package.

446
00:19:28,053 --> 00:19:29,752
Well, you do, too.

447
00:19:29,754 --> 00:19:32,021
I mean, you're beautiful,
you're independent,

448
00:19:32,023 --> 00:19:33,506
you're intelligent...

449
00:19:33,508 --> 00:19:34,807
Oh, stop.

450
00:19:36,677 --> 00:19:39,312
Well, don't
actually stop.

451
00:19:39,314 --> 00:19:41,347
You're funny.

452
00:19:42,916 --> 00:19:43,916
You're...

453
00:19:45,185 --> 00:19:48,888
really, really
beautiful.

454
00:19:58,565 --> 00:20:00,533
Okay, that probably
wasn't a good idea.

455
00:20:00,535 --> 00:20:02,735
Definitely not.

456
00:20:06,268 --> 00:20:08,102
Berta's gonna love this.

457
