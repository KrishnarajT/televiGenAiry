1
00:00:01,174 --> 00:00:02,823
Previously on,

2
00:00:03,039 --> 00:00:05,778
I am determined to find someone
who wants to be with me

3
00:00:05,796 --> 00:00:08,004
for who I am,
not what I have.

4
00:00:08,025 --> 00:00:09,675
I need to buy
a little bit of everything.

5
00:00:09,692 --> 00:00:11,056
I can help you out with that.

6
00:00:11,073 --> 00:00:13,236
I appreciate it... Kate.

7
00:00:13,296 --> 00:00:15,113
Not a problem...

8
00:00:15,663 --> 00:00:16,805
Sam Wilson.

9
00:00:16,826 --> 00:00:18,567
It's refreshing,

10
00:00:18,595 --> 00:00:20,574
talking to someone like you
for a change.

11
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:21,796
Someone like me?

12
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:23,996
Yeah, someone who's not
constantly trying

13
00:00:24,010 --> 00:00:25,707
to impress me
with how much stuff he's got.

14
00:00:25,714 --> 00:00:27,876
Kate, this is
my friend Alan.

15
00:00:27,886 --> 00:00:29,762
Thanks so much
for picking us up.

16
00:00:29,775 --> 00:00:31,325
Yeah, this clown
rents a room from me,

17
00:00:31,337 --> 00:00:32,875
suddenly I'm running
a taxi service.

18
00:00:32,887 --> 00:00:34,193
You should move out.

19
00:00:34,202 --> 00:00:35,349
Can't afford to.

20
00:00:35,353 --> 00:00:37,021
Maybe you could crash here.

21
00:00:37,041 --> 00:00:38,136
Have you really
thought this through?

22
00:00:38,143 --> 00:00:39,977
I've got to see where
this goes with Kate.

23
00:00:39,992 --> 00:00:41,968
- Promise me one thing.
- What's that?

24
00:00:41,987 --> 00:00:44,313
That we're always honest
with each other.

25
00:00:44,346 --> 00:00:46,146
You got it.

26
00:00:47,982 --> 00:00:49,620
Anyways, I hope that it's okay

27
00:00:49,629 --> 00:00:50,973
that I have people over
on Christmas.

28
00:00:50,985 --> 00:00:52,997
It's just Jake
and Lyndsey and my mom.

29
00:00:53,009 --> 00:00:54,258
Of course.
It's the holidays.

30
00:00:54,267 --> 00:00:55,740
It's the time to be
with the ones you love.

31
00:00:55,751 --> 00:00:57,955
Right. Uh, and my mom.

32
00:00:58,675 --> 00:01:02,235
So, uh, so listen, Sam Wilson,
how are things in Poorville?

33
00:01:02,252 --> 00:01:04,019
Are you Les Misérables?

34
00:01:04,034 --> 00:01:05,938
Actually, it's a hoot.

35
00:01:07,742 --> 00:01:09,283
You know,
last night

36
00:01:09,299 --> 00:01:11,822
Kate and I went shopping
at the 99 Cent Store.

37
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:13,507
That place is amazing.

38
00:01:13,527 --> 00:01:16,130
Did you know that everything
there is 99 cents?

39
00:01:16,154 --> 00:01:19,316
Know it? I registered there
for my wedding.

40
00:01:19,347 --> 00:01:21,701
Two cans of peaches, 99 cents.

41
00:01:21,712 --> 00:01:24,147
Four-pack of yogurt, 99 cents.

42
00:01:24,324 --> 00:01:26,094
This owl-shaped mug?

43
00:01:26,113 --> 00:01:27,889
99 cents.

44
00:01:27,978 --> 00:01:29,688
Guess how much
the wine inside was?

45
00:01:29,702 --> 00:01:32,483
Uh, I'm going to go out
on a limb and say 99 cents?

46
00:01:32,507 --> 00:01:34,507
79 cents.

47
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:36,938
Dented box.

48
00:01:36,976 --> 00:01:39,243
From now on, I'm buying
everything from that place.

49
00:01:39,254 --> 00:01:40,263
Uh, not condoms.

50
00:01:40,270 --> 00:01:42,666
I think that's how
I ended up with Jake.

51
00:01:43,373 --> 00:01:44,102
Hey.

52
00:01:44,127 --> 00:01:45,324
Hey, baby.

53
00:01:45,344 --> 00:01:46,510
Uh, I gotta go.

54
00:01:46,515 --> 00:01:47,848
Oh, hey, Katie.

55
00:01:47,871 --> 00:01:49,153
Alan.

56
00:01:49,188 --> 00:01:50,168
How are you?

57
00:01:50,183 --> 00:01:51,541
I'm fine— just, uh...

58
00:01:51,554 --> 00:01:54,689
sipping some wine I got
at the 999 Dollar Store.

59
00:01:55,871 --> 00:01:57,717
Bye, Alan.

60
00:01:57,812 --> 00:01:59,217
Douche.

61
00:01:59,438 --> 00:02:00,994
Don't worry about him.

62
00:02:01,127 --> 00:02:02,583
How was your day?

63
00:02:02,596 --> 00:02:04,343
It's Christmas, Sam.

64
00:02:04,375 --> 00:02:06,940
Happy people wishing you
"Peace on Earth."

65
00:02:06,962 --> 00:02:08,769
It was horrible.

66
00:02:08,796 --> 00:02:10,742
Okay, somebody's got
a case of the Grinches.

67
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:13,224
No, it's a case
of nine-hour shifts

68
00:02:13,245 --> 00:02:16,865
listening to Celine Dion
murder "O Holy Night."

69
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:18,467
If I ever meet
that skinny bitch,

70
00:02:18,481 --> 00:02:21,783
I'm going to beat
the "O Holy" crap out of her.

71
00:02:21,799 --> 00:02:23,825
And that's what Christmas
is all about.

72
00:02:25,184 --> 00:02:26,590
I'm sorry.

73
00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:28,040
Tell me about your day.

74
00:02:28,061 --> 00:02:30,728
After you left,
I made some breakfast...

75
00:02:30,752 --> 00:02:32,667
Oh, I got the mail.

76
00:02:32,695 --> 00:02:35,412
And then I did some work on
that app I've been developing,

77
00:02:35,443 --> 00:02:38,895
and then I did some serious
research on World War II.

78
00:02:38,912 --> 00:02:39,905
Really?

79
00:02:39,925 --> 00:02:42,247
Well, I fell asleep
watching the History Channel.

80
00:02:42,306 --> 00:02:44,131
Sweetie, can I be honest
with you?

81
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:45,423
Yeah. What's up?

82
00:02:45,433 --> 00:02:48,217
I am working my ass off.

83
00:02:48,411 --> 00:02:51,292
It would be really,
really nice if you could,

84
00:02:51,626 --> 00:02:54,210
I don't know,
pitch in a little.

85
00:02:55,068 --> 00:02:57,823
You heard the part about me
getting the mail, right?

86
00:02:58,922 --> 00:03:01,624
You do understand that what came
in the mail is a pile of bills?

87
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:02,182
Okay...

88
00:03:02,189 --> 00:03:03,757
I mean, I think
it is great

89
00:03:03,764 --> 00:03:05,857
that you're working on
your computer stuff,

90
00:03:05,886 --> 00:03:07,552
but we need help now.

91
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:09,583
I get it.
Say no more.

92
00:03:09,845 --> 00:03:12,371
I'll start looking
for a job.

93
00:03:12,379 --> 00:03:13,494
Thank you.

94
00:03:13,656 --> 00:03:14,904
And don't worry,
it's not like

95
00:03:14,916 --> 00:03:16,211
I expect you to make
a million dollars or anything.

96
00:03:16,222 --> 00:03:17,975
Oh, thank God!

97
00:03:20,947 --> 00:03:23,278
Go ahead. I'm going
to go run a bath.

98
00:03:23,295 --> 00:03:25,727
I reek of comfort and joy.

99
00:03:27,984 --> 00:03:29,520
Hey, Billy. What's up?

100
00:03:29,541 --> 00:03:31,648
Nothing much—
just running our company

101
00:03:31,664 --> 00:03:33,869
while you take
some personal time.

102
00:03:33,884 --> 00:03:36,118
Why don't you just man up
and admit you're in rehab?

103
00:03:36,135 --> 00:03:37,590
I am not in rehab.

104
00:03:37,596 --> 00:03:40,147
I told you.
I'm on a spiritual journey.

105
00:03:40,165 --> 00:03:41,815
Spiritual journey.
Yeah, you know what?

106
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:45,314
I've been on four of those.
I still wake up craving meth.

107
00:03:45,716 --> 00:03:48,042
I call it "Eat, Pray, Love,

108
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:50,987
Have Angry Sex
with an Asian Hooker."

109
00:03:51,015 --> 00:03:52,192
What do you want, Billy?

110
00:03:52,207 --> 00:03:53,436
Well, I'm just keeping
you in the loop

111
00:03:53,454 --> 00:03:54,753
about what's
going on around here.

112
00:03:54,771 --> 00:03:56,499
We got new computers
in the bullpen.

113
00:03:56,518 --> 00:03:58,169
We got a staple-less stapler.

114
00:03:58,182 --> 00:03:59,610
Mark Zuckerberg offered to buy

115
00:03:59,619 --> 00:04:01,536
a controlling interest
in the company for 800 million,

116
00:04:01,555 --> 00:04:04,925
and the redhead in marketing
is not wearing bras.

117
00:04:05,856 --> 00:04:07,421
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

118
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:10,434
There's a staple-less stapler?

119
00:04:10,456 --> 00:04:12,510
I think we should
take his offer.

120
00:04:12,521 --> 00:04:15,269
Billy, we built the Electric
Suitcase from the ground up.

121
00:04:15,285 --> 00:04:17,359
I mean, besides,
we've been here before.

122
00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:19,306
You hated the fact
that I sold our last company

123
00:04:19,325 --> 00:04:21,076
and I've come to realize
that you were right.

124
00:04:21,092 --> 00:04:23,711
I hated Tarnell, the gangsta
who sold me crack,

125
00:04:23,748 --> 00:04:25,998
but I was still happy
to work with him.

126
00:04:26,066 --> 00:04:27,841
I mean, look,
this is a good offer.

127
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:29,382
We should take it.

128
00:04:29,401 --> 00:04:30,294
Okay.

129
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:33,494
Tell him 1.2 billion,
but we keep control.

130
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:35,801
Where do you think we're
going to get a better offer?

131
00:04:35,823 --> 00:04:37,892
Bath's ready.
Want to join me?

132
00:04:37,906 --> 00:04:40,470
I just got a better offer.
Good-bye.

I nearly dropped the champagne.

143
00:05:15,158 --> 00:05:17,325
Where did you get money
to buy champagne?

144
00:05:17,357 --> 00:05:19,020
You left some for me.

145
00:05:19,028 --> 00:05:20,808
For emergencies.

146
00:05:20,821 --> 00:05:23,375
Yeah.
We were out of champagne.

147
00:05:24,406 --> 00:05:26,073
So, what are you doing here?

148
00:05:26,103 --> 00:05:28,200
What am I doing here
in my house?

149
00:05:28,209 --> 00:05:29,776
Uh, uh, I'm sorry.
Let me rephrase that.

150
00:05:29,787 --> 00:05:32,173
Uh, uh, great to see you.
What brings you by?

151
00:05:32,194 --> 00:05:33,961
I'm doing laundry
for Kate and me.

152
00:05:33,968 --> 00:05:35,317
Really?
You did laundry.

153
00:05:35,329 --> 00:05:37,464
No, I did laundry.

154
00:05:38,103 --> 00:05:39,233
Thank you.

155
00:05:39,235 --> 00:05:41,351
So, you're, like,
some sort of kept man, huh?

156
00:05:41,368 --> 00:05:43,258
Well, I'm supposed
to be out job hunting,

157
00:05:43,273 --> 00:05:44,152
but it's kind of hard

158
00:05:44,163 --> 00:05:46,230
since Sam Wilson
doesn't actually exist.

159
00:05:46,256 --> 00:05:47,967
I can help you there.

160
00:05:47,988 --> 00:05:50,754
Five grand will get you
a clean Social Security card

161
00:05:50,777 --> 00:05:53,155
and a new set
of fingerprints.

162
00:05:53,582 --> 00:05:55,479
Six will get you
the fingers.

163
00:05:55,492 --> 00:05:56,807
The fingers?

164
00:05:56,829 --> 00:05:58,616
Better to have and not need

165
00:05:58,630 --> 00:06:00,805
than to need and not have.

166
00:06:03,679 --> 00:06:06,510
Hey, uh, why don't you
just go to an ATM,

167
00:06:06,535 --> 00:06:09,452
pull out a few thousand dollars
and tell her you got a job?

168
00:06:09,474 --> 00:06:10,952
But that would be lying.

169
00:06:11,099 --> 00:06:14,822
Oh, no, you wouldn't want
to lie to her, Sam Wilson.

170
00:06:14,852 --> 00:06:16,832
Let me explain something
to you, Alan.

171
00:06:16,843 --> 00:06:18,906
Walden Schmidt lies.

172
00:06:18,919 --> 00:06:21,203
Sam Wilson tells the truth.

173
00:06:21,228 --> 00:06:23,822
Besides, I like
Sam Wilson's life.

174
00:06:23,848 --> 00:06:27,094
It feels more like...
I don't know, real life.

175
00:06:27,116 --> 00:06:28,605
Yeah, I get that.

176
00:06:28,615 --> 00:06:30,458
I mean, that's why I like
to sleep in your bed.

177
00:06:30,464 --> 00:06:32,719
Feels more like a real bed.

178
00:06:33,185 --> 00:06:34,530
Oh, and get this.

179
00:06:34,537 --> 00:06:36,049
I got a call from Billy today.

180
00:06:36,089 --> 00:06:40,141
We got an offer to buy
our company for $800 million.

181
00:06:43,295 --> 00:06:44,829
Excuse me a sec.

182
00:06:58,546 --> 00:07:00,731
$800 million?

183
00:07:02,303 --> 00:07:03,854
Yeah, We turned it down.

184
00:07:03,868 --> 00:07:05,596
You turned it down.

185
00:07:18,454 --> 00:07:19,935
Check it out.

186
00:07:20,650 --> 00:07:22,360
Oh, Sam!

187
00:07:22,371 --> 00:07:24,357
I hope you stole that.

188
00:07:24,552 --> 00:07:26,375
Ah, it wasn't that expensive.

189
00:07:26,383 --> 00:07:28,520
We barely made rent this month.

190
00:07:28,547 --> 00:07:30,699
I know,
but it's Christmas.

191
00:07:30,717 --> 00:07:32,661
You don't have to tell me.

192
00:07:32,677 --> 00:07:33,827
I'm earning extra money

193
00:07:33,839 --> 00:07:37,007
by making a Santa outfit
for my boss' Labradoodle.

194
00:07:37,019 --> 00:07:38,225
Aw, that's cute.

195
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,565
Yeah, then I'm going to make

196
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:42,081
three wise men costumes
for her cats.

197
00:07:42,299 --> 00:07:45,266
And just like that,
cute becomes creepy.

198
00:07:45,816 --> 00:07:47,452
Okay, I'm going
to go change.

199
00:07:47,463 --> 00:07:48,791
I've got a lead
on a job.

200
00:07:48,798 --> 00:07:49,780
- Really?
- Yeah.

201
00:07:49,790 --> 00:07:52,052
If that doesn't work,
I'm going to rob a bank.

202
00:07:52,083 --> 00:07:55,206
I hope the 99 Cent Store
sells ski masks.

203
00:07:57,176 --> 00:07:59,978
- Oh, man.
- What?

204
00:08:00,015 --> 00:08:02,594
I forgot to give Santa
a tail-hole.

205
00:08:02,876 --> 00:08:05,507
Worst Christmas carol ever.

206
00:08:12,125 --> 00:08:14,092
- Hey, Dad.
- Hey, buddy.

207
00:08:14,108 --> 00:08:15,391
You excited about Christmas?

208
00:08:15,407 --> 00:08:17,644
Yeah, that's actually
why I was calling.

209
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:19,648
I'm not going to be able
to make it home this year.

210
00:08:19,670 --> 00:08:21,180
What? Why?

211
00:08:21,190 --> 00:08:22,432
My girlfriend Tammy Sue

212
00:08:22,446 --> 00:08:24,780
asked me to spend Christmas
with her and her three kids.

213
00:08:24,795 --> 00:08:26,067
I'm pretending to be Santa

214
00:08:26,074 --> 00:08:28,175
and also their various fathers.

215
00:08:28,563 --> 00:08:30,262
Oh, kill me.

216
00:08:30,461 --> 00:08:32,217
H-H-How did you meet this woman?

217
00:08:32,231 --> 00:08:34,876
I play softball
with her parole officer.

218
00:08:35,016 --> 00:08:37,787
Oh, dig me up and kill me again.

219
00:08:38,996 --> 00:08:41,739
All right, well,
I hope I see you soon.

220
00:08:41,755 --> 00:08:43,246
Don't worry—
we'll all come visit

221
00:08:43,261 --> 00:08:45,678
as soon as Tammy Sue
gets her ankle bracelet off.

222
00:08:46,024 --> 00:08:48,416
That will be a magical day.

223
00:08:48,738 --> 00:08:49,596
Yeah.

224
00:08:49,611 --> 00:08:51,841
Well, all right—
Merry Christmas, Dad. Bye.

225
00:08:51,851 --> 00:08:53,888
Merry Christmas, Jake.

226
00:08:56,519 --> 00:08:59,628
Time now
for the magic of bourbon.

227
00:09:01,636 --> 00:09:02,669
Hi.

228
00:09:02,996 --> 00:09:05,300
I was here earlier.
I bought a tree.

229
00:09:05,307 --> 00:09:08,224
Uh, I was hoping I could talk
to you about something else.

230
00:09:08,241 --> 00:09:10,229
If somebody told you
I'm selling pot here,

231
00:09:10,248 --> 00:09:12,540
that is just crazy talk.

232
00:09:12,738 --> 00:09:14,104
Uh, no.

233
00:09:14,131 --> 00:09:16,598
I saw the "help wanted" sign.
I was hoping to get a job.

234
00:09:16,619 --> 00:09:18,823
Oh. Have a seat.

235
00:09:19,704 --> 00:09:22,229
You got any, uh,
Christmas tree experience?

236
00:09:23,416 --> 00:09:25,793
I-I've decorated a bunch.

237
00:09:27,176 --> 00:09:28,926
Experience, none.

238
00:09:29,451 --> 00:09:31,567
It's... Wait, it's selling
Christmas trees.

239
00:09:31,588 --> 00:09:33,117
Pop quiz, hot shot.

240
00:09:33,132 --> 00:09:34,964
A mom walks in;
she's driving a Lexus.

241
00:09:34,987 --> 00:09:36,725
She's got a big living room,
cathedral ceiling.

242
00:09:36,730 --> 00:09:37,659
What are you pushing?

243
00:09:37,672 --> 00:09:39,681
Balsam? Noble?
Doug fir?

244
00:09:39,697 --> 00:09:40,787
Uh...

245
00:09:40,799 --> 00:09:43,203
You're out of time.
She's across the street

246
00:09:43,215 --> 00:09:44,639
buying a 20-footer...

247
00:09:44,657 --> 00:09:46,369
from the Armenian.

248
00:09:48,552 --> 00:09:50,655
Are you comfortable
with celebrities?

249
00:09:50,845 --> 00:09:51,955
What do you mean?

250
00:09:51,961 --> 00:09:53,282
We get a lot of big names.

251
00:09:53,294 --> 00:09:55,517
Mario Lopez buys
his tree here every year.

252
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:57,927
I don't want you getting
all jelly-legged.

253
00:09:58,170 --> 00:09:59,117
All right, look.

254
00:09:59,135 --> 00:10:01,607
I'm young, I'm strong,
and I need the money.

255
00:10:01,630 --> 00:10:03,944
I'll work really hard
and I won't let you down.

256
00:10:03,985 --> 00:10:06,374
I'll give you seven bucks
an hour, plus tips.

257
00:10:06,396 --> 00:10:08,198
Minimum wage is eight.

258
00:10:08,211 --> 00:10:10,104
Look at my shoes.

259
00:10:11,132 --> 00:10:12,450
What about them?

260
00:10:12,465 --> 00:10:13,791
Where are they?

261
00:10:13,803 --> 00:10:16,904
Under the table...
Oh!

262
00:10:18,358 --> 00:10:19,574
I'm in.

263
00:10:19,591 --> 00:10:21,123
When can you start?

264
00:10:21,225 --> 00:10:22,186
Right now.

265
00:10:22,198 --> 00:10:24,471
A man with no life.
I like it.

266
00:10:24,603 --> 00:10:26,604
I'll go get you
some gloves.

267
00:10:28,525 --> 00:10:31,319
By the way, your cell phone's
like your penis.

268
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:34,133
When you're at work,
you keep it in your pants.

269
00:10:37,571 --> 00:10:40,190
Hey, Billy, I'm kind of busy.

270
00:10:40,369 --> 00:10:42,797
I'm not in rehab.

271
00:10:43,505 --> 00:10:46,211
Relax, Zuckerberg
is not going to walk.

272
00:10:46,227 --> 00:10:49,081
Just sit tight and we'll
get the number we want.

273
00:10:49,233 --> 00:10:51,518
I got to go.
Bye.

274
00:10:51,631 --> 00:10:53,214
All right, here you go.

275
00:10:53,225 --> 00:10:54,949
Oh, and, uh, by the way.

276
00:10:54,971 --> 00:10:57,549
If somebody comes looking
for a Jamaican Christmas tree,

277
00:10:57,568 --> 00:10:59,578
you send them to me.

278
00:11:00,398 --> 00:11:02,214
Yah, mon.

279
00:11:13,331 --> 00:11:14,898
I got a job.

280
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:16,134
As what?

281
00:11:16,152 --> 00:11:18,719
Prancer, the reindeer stripper?

282
00:11:19,224 --> 00:11:21,372
Nope. Selling Christmas trees.

283
00:11:21,381 --> 00:11:23,565
- You're kidding.
- Yeah.

284
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:25,953
Already sold nine trees.

285
00:11:25,979 --> 00:11:27,464
- Nice.
- Yeah, it's the first night,

286
00:11:27,479 --> 00:11:28,454
and I'm getting the stinkeye

287
00:11:28,469 --> 00:11:29,572
from the other salesman, Jose.

288
00:11:29,588 --> 00:11:32,468
He only sold six, but the guy
crushes it with wreathes.

289
00:11:32,592 --> 00:11:33,597
Check it out.

290
00:11:33,616 --> 00:11:35,902
Made enough on tips
to get us Chinese food.

291
00:11:35,921 --> 00:11:37,364
Aw, you really know how

292
00:11:37,375 --> 00:11:39,058
to take care of your lady,
Rudolph.

293
00:11:39,065 --> 00:11:42,160
Oh, no, no, no, I don't get
the nose until I sell 50 trees.

294
00:11:42,211 --> 00:11:45,428
Shall we open a
fresh box of wine?

295
00:11:45,450 --> 00:11:46,155
No.

296
00:11:46,164 --> 00:11:47,079
No, no, no, no!

297
00:11:47,085 --> 00:11:48,917
Oh, switching to soda.

298
00:11:49,211 --> 00:11:52,095
My sewing machine—
it just died on me.

299
00:11:52,121 --> 00:11:53,315
Okay, no problem.

300
00:11:53,334 --> 00:11:54,790
Sewing machines
can be fixed.

301
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,324
No, it's gonna cost more
to fix it

302
00:11:56,331 --> 00:11:57,818
than I'll make on this job.

303
00:11:57,830 --> 00:11:59,496
Okay, it's not a problem.

304
00:11:59,513 --> 00:12:00,893
Look at the bright side,

305
00:12:00,915 --> 00:12:03,720
somewhere in the world, there's
a Labradoodle and three cats

306
00:12:03,751 --> 00:12:05,855
that get to keep
their dignity.

307
00:12:06,829 --> 00:12:08,931
I wish that made me feel better.

308
00:12:08,950 --> 00:12:11,352
I got something that will
make you feel better.

309
00:12:11,393 --> 00:12:13,167
Let's dance.
What?

310
00:12:13,203 --> 00:12:14,549
There's no music.

311
00:12:14,578 --> 00:12:16,062
I'll sing.

312
00:12:16,096 --> 00:12:19,347
♪ Oh, holy night

313
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:24,501
♪ The stars were
brightly shining... ♪

314
00:12:26,101 --> 00:12:27,768
I love you, Sam.

315
00:12:27,786 --> 00:12:29,553
I hate that song,

316
00:12:29,570 --> 00:12:31,184
but I love you.

317
00:12:31,375 --> 00:12:32,970
I love you.

318
00:12:34,972 --> 00:12:36,360
Did we just...

319
00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:38,408
Yep, I think we did.

320
00:12:42,078 --> 00:12:45,376
I got something else that
will make you feel better.

321
00:12:45,665 --> 00:12:47,852
Let's get naked...

322
00:12:48,872 --> 00:12:51,090
and play some reindeer games.

323
00:12:51,544 --> 00:12:54,246
Are you gonna leave
those antlers on?

324
00:12:54,272 --> 00:12:55,677
Oh, yeah.

325
00:12:58,394 --> 00:12:59,447
Okay, drive slow.

326
00:12:59,457 --> 00:13:01,574
Stick to the side streets.

327
00:13:06,233 --> 00:13:08,399
Well, you are a natural, kid.

328
00:13:08,412 --> 00:13:10,463
You remind me of a young me.

329
00:13:10,572 --> 00:13:12,854
Except you're a little taller
and better-looking.

330
00:13:12,876 --> 00:13:14,874
Probably straight.

331
00:13:16,488 --> 00:13:18,534
Where-where we
going with this?

332
00:13:18,563 --> 00:13:20,180
Apparently nowhere.

333
00:13:20,198 --> 00:13:20,736
All right.

334
00:13:20,747 --> 00:13:21,819
Christmas on three.

335
00:13:21,831 --> 00:13:24,357
- One, two, three, Christmas.
- Christmas.

336
00:13:27,211 --> 00:13:29,048
I did not see that coming.

337
00:13:29,101 --> 00:13:30,384
Walden.

338
00:13:30,465 --> 00:13:31,657
Oh, hey.

339
00:13:31,672 --> 00:13:33,439
Or should I say "Sam"?

340
00:13:33,456 --> 00:13:35,479
Billy, how'd you find me?

341
00:13:35,496 --> 00:13:36,381
Oh, it's easy.

342
00:13:36,391 --> 00:13:37,841
You told Alan
you were working here.

343
00:13:37,843 --> 00:13:39,325
You swore him to secrecy.

344
00:13:39,330 --> 00:13:41,610
I gave him 100 bucks.
Bam, here I am.

345
00:13:41,631 --> 00:13:42,646
You want to buy a tree?

346
00:13:42,661 --> 00:13:43,392
No, no.

347
00:13:43,404 --> 00:13:45,051
I want to sell our company

348
00:13:45,065 --> 00:13:46,066
to Mark Zuckerberg.

349
00:13:46,068 --> 00:13:50,187
He has upped his offer
to $950 million.

350
00:13:50,218 --> 00:13:52,589
Wow, that's a lot of money.

351
00:13:52,628 --> 00:13:53,696
You know...

352
00:13:53,711 --> 00:13:56,295
I could probably get you
into this eight-foot cypress

353
00:13:56,311 --> 00:13:59,000
from Oregon for 50 bucks
off the sticker price.

354
00:13:59,030 --> 00:14:01,281
$950 million.

355
00:14:01,295 --> 00:14:02,995
We can buy Oregon.

356
00:14:03,010 --> 00:14:04,792
Look at how uptight you are.

357
00:14:04,805 --> 00:14:07,184
I mean, you should get a job
here with me selling trees.

358
00:14:07,202 --> 00:14:08,505
It's stress-free.

359
00:14:08,517 --> 00:14:09,760
Everybody leaves here happy—

360
00:14:09,771 --> 00:14:12,607
some people really happy
with a case of the munchies.

361
00:14:12,912 --> 00:14:15,479
Walden, let me just
call Zuckerberg

362
00:14:15,485 --> 00:14:16,834
and close the deal.

363
00:14:16,849 --> 00:14:19,112
You can close the deal at 1.2

364
00:14:19,130 --> 00:14:20,431
for 49% of the company.

365
00:14:20,443 --> 00:14:21,743
I'm not giving up control.

366
00:14:21,753 --> 00:14:22,802
You're crazy, all right?

367
00:14:22,816 --> 00:14:24,757
You are bat-crap freaking crazy.

368
00:14:24,773 --> 00:14:28,191
I've never been so sane
in my entire life.

369
00:14:28,928 --> 00:14:29,737
Now,

370
00:14:29,746 --> 00:14:31,243
if you'll excuse me,

371
00:14:31,251 --> 00:14:34,450
I've got a red, blinking nose
to live up to.

372
00:14:41,923 --> 00:14:44,040
Well, there's my Mrs. Claus.

373
00:14:44,059 --> 00:14:45,034
Hey, Alan.

374
00:14:45,044 --> 00:14:46,326
Good news: my mother bailed.

375
00:14:46,341 --> 00:14:48,268
She's having something
rejuvenated. Don't ask what.

376
00:14:48,292 --> 00:14:51,033
I did and haven't been able
to eat or sleep since.

377
00:14:51,847 --> 00:14:54,766
Jake is with his girlfriend
and her 17 kids,

378
00:14:54,786 --> 00:14:58,371
so it's just you and me, kiddo.

379
00:14:58,539 --> 00:15:00,002
I have some bad news.

380
00:15:00,007 --> 00:15:01,563
I'm not gonna be here
for Christmas.

381
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:02,321
What?

382
00:15:02,345 --> 00:15:03,518
I have to go to Cleveland.

383
00:15:03,532 --> 00:15:05,482
My grandma fell down
and broke her hip.

384
00:15:05,494 --> 00:15:08,032
Big deal. Old people do that
all the time.

385
00:15:08,641 --> 00:15:10,267
It's like a cold with them.

386
00:15:10,269 --> 00:15:12,583
Can't your grandfather
take care of her?

387
00:15:12,602 --> 00:15:15,619
He's dead.
Man, I can't catch a break.

388
00:15:16,158 --> 00:15:17,898
We can celebrate
when I get back.

389
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:20,935
Sure, nothing says Christmas
like January 3rd.

390
00:15:21,148 --> 00:15:22,364
I'm sorry, Alan.

391
00:15:22,377 --> 00:15:23,893
I don't have a choice.

392
00:15:23,912 --> 00:15:25,061
I know.

393
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:26,506
It's okay.

394
00:15:26,637 --> 00:15:28,156
Well, I love you.

395
00:15:28,172 --> 00:15:29,337
I love you, too.

396
00:15:29,354 --> 00:15:30,520
Merry Christmas.

397
00:15:30,546 --> 00:15:32,030
Merry Christmas.

398
00:15:33,263 --> 00:15:35,378
Sometimes she can be so selfish.

399
00:15:36,330 --> 00:15:37,200
All right.

400
00:15:37,212 --> 00:15:38,796
I'm out of here.

401
00:15:46,503 --> 00:15:48,758
I'm gonna hate myself
for asking.

402
00:15:48,821 --> 00:15:50,021
What's wrong?

403
00:15:50,033 --> 00:15:51,816
Well, all my Christmas plans
have fallen apart.

404
00:15:51,828 --> 00:15:53,577
I-I'm gonna be all alone.

405
00:15:53,602 --> 00:15:55,331
Yeah, that's rough.

406
00:15:55,466 --> 00:15:57,688
Happy holidays, Zip.

407
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:17,037
Hello, thank you for calling
the suicide hotline.

408
00:16:18,511 --> 00:16:20,549
All our counselors are busy,

409
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:22,906
but your call
is very important to us.

410
00:16:22,984 --> 00:16:24,506
Please hold.

411
00:16:36,759 --> 00:16:37,810
Sam?

412
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:40,017
Sorry, babe.

413
00:16:40,030 --> 00:16:41,619
I didn't mean to wake you up.

414
00:16:41,626 --> 00:16:42,721
How was work?

415
00:16:42,729 --> 00:16:44,512
My body aches.

416
00:16:44,635 --> 00:16:46,493
My hands are blistered.

417
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:48,449
I can hardly feel my feet.

418
00:16:48,470 --> 00:16:50,157
It was awesome.

419
00:16:52,267 --> 00:16:54,936
I wish I felt that way
about my job.

420
00:16:55,207 --> 00:16:58,337
Yeah, but your job's
just a way to get by

421
00:16:58,367 --> 00:17:00,662
until you get your big break
as a designer.

422
00:17:00,681 --> 00:17:03,669
I've been getting by
for three years now.

423
00:17:04,584 --> 00:17:06,748
What if it never happens?

424
00:17:06,773 --> 00:17:08,310
I mean, for God's sakes,

425
00:17:08,321 --> 00:17:11,227
I don't even have
a sewing machine that works.

426
00:17:11,251 --> 00:17:13,084
You got a boyfriend that does.

427
00:17:14,288 --> 00:17:16,023
Did you sell more wreaths
than Jose?

428
00:17:16,038 --> 00:17:17,806
No.

429
00:17:18,059 --> 00:17:20,961
That guy is
a wreath-selling machine.

430
00:17:21,533 --> 00:17:24,180
He sold one to a guy
without a door.

431
00:17:26,333 --> 00:17:28,000
Aw.

432
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:30,119
Is that mistletoe?

433
00:17:30,142 --> 00:17:31,907
It's supposed to be.

434
00:17:32,011 --> 00:17:34,072
It's actually broccoli.

435
00:17:35,205 --> 00:17:37,534
I thought it would
be romantic.

436
00:17:37,976 --> 00:17:39,376
It is.

437
00:17:40,808 --> 00:17:41,704
You want to...

438
00:17:41,713 --> 00:17:42,729
Oh, no, hell, no.

439
00:17:42,746 --> 00:17:44,576
Thank God.

440
00:17:46,695 --> 00:17:50,147
(slurring):
♪ I have no gift to bring

441
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:53,040
♪ Pah-rum-pum-pum-pum.

442
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:03,684
♪ I have no friends or life

443
00:18:03,733 --> 00:18:05,516
♪ Pah-rum-pum-pum

444
00:18:05,557 --> 00:18:06,920
♪ Rum-pum-pum-pum.

445
00:18:06,935 --> 00:18:08,012
Look at you.

446
00:18:08,034 --> 00:18:10,868
Drunk as your brother
and none of the charm.

447
00:18:11,466 --> 00:18:12,358
Berta?

448
00:18:12,377 --> 00:18:14,746
I got chicken and beer.

449
00:18:16,824 --> 00:18:18,255
You came back for me.

450
00:18:18,270 --> 00:18:19,910
Oh, all right, calm down.

451
00:18:19,929 --> 00:18:21,423
You love me, don't you?

452
00:18:21,437 --> 00:18:22,603
I pity you.

453
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:24,317
Close enough.

454
00:18:28,288 --> 00:18:29,955
You got good taste.

455
00:18:29,985 --> 00:18:32,069
I took home a tree
just like this last week.

456
00:18:32,092 --> 00:18:34,026
I don't know, 90 bucks
is a little bit more

457
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:35,147
than I want to spend.

458
00:18:35,159 --> 00:18:36,388
What do you think, sweetheart?

459
00:18:36,414 --> 00:18:37,422
You like Doug?

460
00:18:37,432 --> 00:18:39,065
His name is Doug?

461
00:18:39,083 --> 00:18:42,286
His name is Douglas,
but his friends call him Doug.

462
00:18:42,398 --> 00:18:44,015
You know what I
like about him?

463
00:18:44,019 --> 00:18:45,885
He's tree-mendous.

464
00:18:47,077 --> 00:18:49,224
Daddy, I want Doug.

465
00:18:49,251 --> 00:18:50,683
Oh, you don't want to disappoint

466
00:18:50,719 --> 00:18:52,773
your daughter here
on Christmas Eve.

467
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:54,758
Excuse me,

468
00:18:54,777 --> 00:18:56,558
Mr. Tree Salesman.

469
00:18:56,581 --> 00:18:57,452
What do you want?

470
00:18:57,455 --> 00:18:58,504
I'm trying to close
a deal here.

471
00:18:58,521 --> 00:18:59,306
So am I.

472
00:18:59,316 --> 00:19:02,016
I have Mark freaking Zuckerberg
on the phone.

473
00:19:02,038 --> 00:19:04,270
- Is he at 1.2?
- He's at a billion.

474
00:19:04,289 --> 00:19:06,501
All right now, Walden,
think about that number.

475
00:19:06,521 --> 00:19:08,363
You know how when you say
someone's one in a million?

476
00:19:08,390 --> 00:19:10,057
You could have a
thousand of them,

477
00:19:10,076 --> 00:19:12,097
but we have to give
him an answer.

478
00:19:12,211 --> 00:19:15,697
Okay, you tell him 1.2
for 49% of the company,

479
00:19:15,727 --> 00:19:17,110
and I'll throw in a wreath.

480
00:19:17,126 --> 00:19:18,879
Suck it, Jose.

481
00:19:19,743 --> 00:19:20,880
What do you think?

482
00:19:20,893 --> 00:19:22,321
I'll give you 30 bucks.

483
00:19:22,339 --> 00:19:23,934
- 70.
- 40.

484
00:19:23,978 --> 00:19:27,414
1.1. Don't make me bitch-slap
you in front of this child.

485
00:19:27,873 --> 00:19:29,325
1.2.

486
00:19:29,368 --> 00:19:31,785
65, and I'll flock it
for you myself.

487
00:19:31,886 --> 00:19:34,420
- 50.
- 60, and I'll throw in a stand.

488
00:19:34,453 --> 00:19:36,212
It's Christmas Eve.
You're not gonna move this tree.

489
00:19:36,229 --> 00:19:37,769
1.15. You say yes

490
00:19:37,790 --> 00:19:39,906
or I will shove that nose
up your Blitzen.

491
00:19:39,942 --> 00:19:41,942
1.2.

492
00:19:41,967 --> 00:19:43,403
It's Christmas Eve,

493
00:19:43,433 --> 00:19:45,799
and Santa needs a tree
to put the presents under.

494
00:19:45,830 --> 00:19:48,331
- 55, final offer.
- 1.2!

495
00:19:48,354 --> 00:19:49,687
Sold, sold.

496
00:19:49,705 --> 00:19:51,288
Yay!

497
00:19:52,362 --> 00:19:55,843
Oh, you did it,
you magnificent bastard.

498
00:19:57,563 --> 00:19:59,965
Really? Him, not me?

499
00:20:05,496 --> 00:20:07,301
Who is this for?

500
00:20:07,676 --> 00:20:10,381
"To Kate, from Santa."

501
00:20:10,419 --> 00:20:14,271
I have a horrible feeling
this breaks our $20 rule.

502
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:16,209
Open it.

503
00:20:16,276 --> 00:20:18,018
Okay.

504
00:20:21,448 --> 00:20:24,300
Oh, my God, Sam.

505
00:20:24,346 --> 00:20:26,620
A sewing machine?

506
00:20:26,655 --> 00:20:28,505
How can you afford this?

507
00:20:28,547 --> 00:20:30,597
Let's just say
I had a very good day

508
00:20:30,630 --> 00:20:32,413
at the Christmas tree lot.

509
00:20:33,856 --> 00:20:35,305
You like it?

510
00:20:35,388 --> 00:20:36,787
I love it.

511
00:20:39,732 --> 00:20:42,250
I feel kind of stupid
about the scarf now.

512
00:20:42,266 --> 00:20:43,548
Are you kidding me?

513
00:20:43,573 --> 00:20:45,258
This... You made this yourself.

514
00:20:45,331 --> 00:20:47,581
This is the best gift
I've ever gotten.

515
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:48,995
Maybe later

516
00:20:49,012 --> 00:20:51,263
you can sew me
a little tail-hole.

517
00:20:53,489 --> 00:20:54,754
Merry Christmas, Sam.

518
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:56,469
Oh, wait.

519
00:20:56,667 --> 00:20:59,243
Look what else Santa brought.

520
00:20:59,408 --> 00:21:01,143
Broccletoe.
