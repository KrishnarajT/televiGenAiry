00:00:01,656 --> 00:00:03,702
Previously
on Two and a Half Men...

2
00:00:03,927 --> 00:00:07,262
Zoey, will you do me
the honor of becoming

3
00:00:08,119 --> 00:00:12,288
Zoey Hyde
Tottingham-Pierce-Schmidt?

4
00:00:13,365 --> 00:00:15,985
No. I'm sorry.
I can't do it.

5
00:00:18,937 --> 00:00:20,841
I need an answer.

6
00:00:20,924 --> 00:00:22,925
There's someone else.

7
00:00:28,391 --> 00:00:30,220
I like that red dress
on you.

8
00:00:30,248 --> 00:00:31,892
I feel like a bull.

9
00:00:31,925 --> 00:00:34,325
I want to charge.

10
00:00:34,616 --> 00:00:37,849
Speaking of charging, did you
bring your wallet this time?

11
00:00:38,127 --> 00:00:40,748
The last two times
were honest mistakes.

12
00:00:41,667 --> 00:00:44,137
And I fully intend
to pay you back.

13
00:00:46,466 --> 00:00:49,522
Oh, that's just great, Justin.

14
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:51,484
If your mom says it's bath time,

15
00:00:51,496 --> 00:00:53,797
by all means take a bath.

16
00:00:53,984 --> 00:00:55,750
Meanwhile the free world

17
00:00:55,764 --> 00:00:58,847
is falling into the hands
of cyber-terrorists.

18
00:01:00,168 --> 00:01:01,392
You okay?

19
00:01:01,404 --> 00:01:02,733
Yeah.

20
00:01:02,756 --> 00:01:04,331
My sniper's got to get ready

21
00:01:04,366 --> 00:01:07,040
for Sixth Grade
Picture Day tomorrow.

22
00:01:08,966 --> 00:01:10,416
Oh, you guys look nice.

23
00:01:10,426 --> 00:01:12,068
Oh, thanks.
We're going out to dinner.

24
00:01:12,094 --> 00:01:13,093
Want to join us?

25
00:01:13,095 --> 00:01:15,508
No, I got a burrito
in the microwave.

26
00:01:15,526 --> 00:01:17,107
Okay, enjoy.

27
00:01:17,142 --> 00:01:19,041
Oh, you did take
the foil off of the, uh...

28
00:01:22,792 --> 00:01:25,053
I'll get my coat.

29
00:01:28,409 --> 00:01:30,749
Isn't that your wallet?

30
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,491
Oh, uh,

31
00:01:32,524 --> 00:01:33,656
yes, that's, uh, uh,

32
00:01:33,676 --> 00:01:36,116
I-I-I-I put it there
so I wouldn't forget it.

Sync for WEB-DL by ryangiggsth

34
00:02:08,286 --> 00:02:10,095
I'm really glad
we did this.

35
00:02:10,121 --> 00:02:11,521
I've been playing
with kids I met

36
00:02:11,541 --> 00:02:13,241
on the Internet
for too long.

37
00:02:14,634 --> 00:02:18,371
Now that I say that out loud,
I'm really glad we did this.

38
00:02:18,967 --> 00:02:19,906
Mm!

39
00:02:19,923 --> 00:02:21,721
I'll get this.

40
00:02:25,009 --> 00:02:26,844
I'll get it.

41
00:02:28,665 --> 00:02:31,627
Oh, okay, I guess
I'm really gonna get this.

42
00:02:32,221 --> 00:02:33,353
Thanks, Al.

43
00:02:33,355 --> 00:02:35,509
Oh, it's my pleasure.

44
00:02:35,543 --> 00:02:36,838
Are you crying?

45
00:02:36,859 --> 00:02:37,958
What? No, no.

46
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,921
I have, uh, I have allergies.

47
00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:42,884
It's probably the dust
from opening his wallet.

48
00:02:46,028 --> 00:02:47,218
Damn it.

49
00:02:47,252 --> 00:02:48,155
What?

50
00:02:48,178 --> 00:02:49,759
It's Zoey

51
00:02:49,775 --> 00:02:51,699
and her new boyfriend.

52
00:02:51,738 --> 00:02:53,289
I am so sorry.

53
00:02:53,309 --> 00:02:56,172
This is tough
after what she did to you.

54
00:02:57,510 --> 00:02:59,680
Come on,
let's just get this over with.

55
00:03:00,788 --> 00:03:02,322
He didn't deserve it.

56
00:03:02,335 --> 00:03:03,602
He gave her everything.

57
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:05,870
He actually
has things to give.

58
00:03:07,103 --> 00:03:08,986
Hi, Zoey.

59
00:03:10,670 --> 00:03:12,857
Walden, Hi.

60
00:03:13,213 --> 00:03:14,869
- Lyndsey.
- Hi.

61
00:03:14,899 --> 00:03:16,255
- Alan.
- Pfft!

62
00:03:18,676 --> 00:03:21,723
Um, this is my friend, Peter.

63
00:03:21,933 --> 00:03:23,466
Peter.

64
00:03:23,623 --> 00:03:24,937
Hi. Nice to meet you.

65
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:25,947
Cheers, mate.

66
00:03:25,964 --> 00:03:28,440
"Cheers, mate.
We hosted the Olympics."

67
00:03:30,112 --> 00:03:31,913
This is a bit awkward.

68
00:03:31,915 --> 00:03:33,181
Why is this awkward?

69
00:03:33,183 --> 00:03:35,216
Oh, yes, that's right,
I remember.

70
00:03:35,218 --> 00:03:37,085
Because you ruined
my best friend's life.

71
00:03:37,087 --> 00:03:38,661
I'm-I'm sorry.
Nice to meet you.

72
00:03:38,678 --> 00:03:40,745
What you did to him was
wanton and reprehensible.

73
00:03:40,775 --> 00:03:43,277
- All right, keep moving.
- Jezebel!

74
00:03:44,270 --> 00:03:45,971
If it makes you feel any better,

75
00:03:45,991 --> 00:03:48,083
he didn't like you before.

76
00:03:52,252 --> 00:03:53,952
How you doing?
You okay?

77
00:03:53,974 --> 00:03:56,141
Oh, yeah, I'm fine. I mean,
my heart's racing but, you know...

78
00:03:56,153 --> 00:03:58,284
I was talking to Walden.

79
00:03:59,982 --> 00:04:01,364
Yeah, I guess.

80
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:03,447
I mean, I thought seeing her
with somebody else

81
00:04:03,481 --> 00:04:05,915
would be the end of the world, but

82
00:04:05,930 --> 00:04:08,259
I'm really okay with it.

83
00:04:08,286 --> 00:04:09,953
You're a better man than I am.

84
00:04:09,955 --> 00:04:11,980
We all know that, Alan.

85
00:04:13,009 --> 00:04:14,546
Yeah, I guess what I'm saying is

86
00:04:14,559 --> 00:04:16,283
it wasn't as bad
as I thought it would be.

87
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:18,780
I mean, clearly Alan has
some unresolved issues,

88
00:04:19,263 --> 00:04:21,499
but I think I'm ready
to move on.

89
00:04:21,526 --> 00:04:23,159
I can definitely help you there.

90
00:04:23,189 --> 00:04:25,245
Uh, where you going
with this, sweetie?

91
00:04:25,271 --> 00:04:27,905
I have a ton of friends who
would die to go out with you.

92
00:04:27,907 --> 00:04:29,140
Really?
Oh, yeah.

93
00:04:29,142 --> 00:04:30,408
That's true.

94
00:04:30,410 --> 00:04:33,615
She has some of the hottest
friends you can imagine.

95
00:04:34,715 --> 00:04:36,747
Uh, that you can imagine,

96
00:04:36,749 --> 00:04:38,209
not that I would.

97
00:04:38,233 --> 00:04:39,726
I mean, why would I?

98
00:04:39,758 --> 00:04:41,858
You're the hottest of
them all, you know?

99
00:04:46,693 --> 00:04:48,320
So what's your type?

100
00:04:48,348 --> 00:04:50,693
I don't know if I have a type.
I mean, I like brunettes,

101
00:04:50,721 --> 00:04:52,408
but well, I married a redhead

102
00:04:52,433 --> 00:04:53,529
and I've dated some blondes.

103
00:04:53,551 --> 00:04:56,729
So I guess what I'm saying is
I'm pro-hair.

104
00:04:57,438 --> 00:05:00,168
Well, in the upper deck not
necessarily around the dugout.

105
00:05:00,348 --> 00:05:01,580
Ah, interesting.

106
00:05:01,591 --> 00:05:03,676
If you're gonna go with
a baseball reference,

107
00:05:03,703 --> 00:05:06,518
I would've gone
with "on the mound." Um...

108
00:05:07,189 --> 00:05:10,092
They all have hair
in the appropriate places.

109
00:05:10,218 --> 00:05:11,694
What else?

110
00:05:11,724 --> 00:05:14,866
I don't know.
I like a girl who's smart,

111
00:05:14,912 --> 00:05:16,640
I like a girl who's funny,

112
00:05:16,659 --> 00:05:20,194
I like a girl who's not gonna
leave me for another guy.

113
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,586
Oh, oh, and no one who wears

114
00:05:22,606 --> 00:05:24,872
those big furry boots
with shorts or mini-skirts.

115
00:05:24,895 --> 00:05:27,551
You're either hot or you're cold.
Take a stand, ladies.

116
00:05:28,221 --> 00:05:29,913
I'll take care of it.

117
00:05:29,952 --> 00:05:31,550
So, Walden,
as I told you,

118
00:05:31,571 --> 00:05:33,515
Jennifer is
my Pilates instructor.

119
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:35,375
Yeah, Pilates.

120
00:05:37,783 --> 00:05:40,763
Well, you're certainly whipping
Lyndsey into shape.

121
00:05:41,154 --> 00:05:43,157
Not that you need it.

122
00:05:43,688 --> 00:05:45,887
Not that I was looking.

123
00:05:46,981 --> 00:05:48,952
Not that you're listening.

124
00:05:50,289 --> 00:05:52,464
Oh, can I take a picture of you?

125
00:05:52,582 --> 00:05:53,904
Okay.

126
00:05:53,961 --> 00:05:55,850
Uploading photo to wall.

127
00:05:55,874 --> 00:05:57,774
"Check out my hot date."

128
00:05:57,798 --> 00:05:59,331
Smiley face.

129
00:05:59,350 --> 00:06:01,299
LOL, right?

130
00:06:06,306 --> 00:06:08,274
So, Pilates,

131
00:06:08,316 --> 00:06:11,316
that's all about strengthening
the core, right?

132
00:06:12,686 --> 00:06:14,047
Hm?

133
00:06:15,322 --> 00:06:19,252
OMG. Cat in a bow tie riding
a skateboard.

134
00:06:19,586 --> 00:06:21,647
Retweeting.

135
00:06:22,195 --> 00:06:24,708
Guy in a bow tie right here.

136
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:27,720
Oh, good news, one person
already likes our date.

137
00:06:28,185 --> 00:06:30,098
Unfriend.

138
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:33,753
So what looks good to you?

139
00:06:33,790 --> 00:06:36,070
Actually, I'm
not going to eat.

140
00:06:37,445 --> 00:06:38,512
Nothing?

141
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:40,414
No, I'm doing a
master cleanse.

142
00:06:40,453 --> 00:06:43,467
So I haven't eaten
solid food in two weeks.

143
00:06:43,841 --> 00:06:45,881
Dawn, you might have
mentioned that

144
00:06:45,898 --> 00:06:47,700
when I told you
we were all going out to dinner.

145
00:06:47,724 --> 00:06:49,790
No, it's no problem;
you guys eat.

146
00:06:49,819 --> 00:06:52,186
This stuff just
flushes you right out.

147
00:06:54,027 --> 00:06:55,561
Well, I guess it's worth it

148
00:06:55,587 --> 00:06:58,137
if it rids the body of all
those toxins and impurities.

149
00:06:58,158 --> 00:07:01,159
Right, and the stuff
that comes out of you.

150
00:07:01,295 --> 00:07:03,362
I swear I found a Barbie head

151
00:07:03,364 --> 00:07:05,964
that I swallowed
in the fifth grade.

152
00:07:05,966 --> 00:07:08,268
Good thing you didn't swallow
her Malibu beach house.

153
00:07:08,284 --> 00:07:10,235
Ouch.

154
00:07:11,333 --> 00:07:13,078
Well, whatever you're doing,
it's working.

155
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:15,504
- You look great.
- Thank you.

156
00:07:15,509 --> 00:07:16,869
I also inject myself

157
00:07:16,878 --> 00:07:18,944
with the urine
of pregnant women.

158
00:07:20,658 --> 00:07:23,627
Yeah, I don't think
I'm gonna eat either.

159
00:07:23,818 --> 00:07:26,653
It's got a hormone in it
that helps you lose weight.

160
00:07:26,705 --> 00:07:30,407
Which is ironic because pregnant
women pack on the pounds.

161
00:07:30,642 --> 00:07:32,909
I will never be fat.

162
00:07:35,293 --> 00:07:37,264
Or married.

163
00:07:38,843 --> 00:07:42,383
I can't believe you created
and sold your own company.

164
00:07:42,438 --> 00:07:45,126
You must be incredibly smart.

165
00:07:45,418 --> 00:07:48,042
I don't know, I think it's
more luck and timing.

166
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:50,700
I think it takes a little bit
more than luck and timing

167
00:07:50,713 --> 00:07:52,994
to make $1.4 billion.

168
00:07:53,749 --> 00:07:55,898
Somebody did their research.

169
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:58,289
I'll bet women
are after you all the time.

170
00:07:58,321 --> 00:08:01,055
I mean, you could look like him
and they'd still be after you.

171
00:08:04,944 --> 00:08:06,806
You know what these women
are thinking, don't you?

172
00:08:06,823 --> 00:08:09,166
"I mean, is this guy gonna ask
for a pre-nup?"

173
00:08:09,281 --> 00:08:11,705
'Cause theoretically,
your alimony payments would run 75,

174
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:13,569
$100,000 a month at least.

175
00:08:13,584 --> 00:08:15,584
And that's
without child support.

176
00:08:15,672 --> 00:08:17,204
You're good at math.

177
00:08:17,206 --> 00:08:19,040
You know, I never thought
I wanted kids,

178
00:08:19,091 --> 00:08:21,467
but with the right person,

179
00:08:21,488 --> 00:08:24,280
I could see myself having
an entire litter.

180
00:08:26,198 --> 00:08:28,807
And I could see myself
having a vasectomy.

181
00:08:38,697 --> 00:08:41,733
When she's on her meds,
she's actually lots of fun.

182
00:08:42,255 --> 00:08:44,131
I am.

183
00:08:49,768 --> 00:08:50,506
Hey.

184
00:08:50,528 --> 00:08:51,276
Hey.

185
00:08:51,307 --> 00:08:52,780
Just got off the phone
with Lyndsey.

186
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,986
She's got another friend.
She says this one's perfect.

187
00:08:55,018 --> 00:08:57,351
No, no more women, Alan.

188
00:08:57,412 --> 00:09:00,080
Wait, they were all women,
right?

189
00:09:01,265 --> 00:09:03,705
In the eyes of the law, yes.

190
00:09:04,631 --> 00:09:06,708
The Olympics, eh.

191
00:09:06,988 --> 00:09:09,437
Look, I know some
of the dates didn't work out.

192
00:09:09,475 --> 00:09:10,810
Didn't work out?

193
00:09:10,838 --> 00:09:13,292
One of them
used her roast chicken

194
00:09:13,294 --> 00:09:16,028
to show me where
she was probed by aliens.

195
00:09:16,607 --> 00:09:18,234
Uh, but you have to admit

196
00:09:18,246 --> 00:09:20,446
the chicken
was out of this world.

197
00:09:25,187 --> 00:09:27,221
You do know Lyndsey and I
are just trying to help.

198
00:09:27,241 --> 00:09:30,035
Yeah, I do, and I appreciate it.
But I think I was wrong.

199
00:09:30,062 --> 00:09:32,099
I just don't think I'm ready
to date right now.

200
00:09:32,116 --> 00:09:33,492
So you're giving up?

201
00:09:33,512 --> 00:09:35,758
No, I'm not giving up.
I just..

202
00:09:35,789 --> 00:09:37,633
I want to change
my pattern, you know?

203
00:09:37,654 --> 00:09:40,452
My whole life I've jumped
from one woman to the next.

204
00:09:40,479 --> 00:09:42,308
I thought that was just
because every time you jumped,

205
00:09:42,323 --> 00:09:44,520
another woman slid in under you.

206
00:09:44,586 --> 00:09:46,152
Well, there's that.

207
00:09:46,174 --> 00:09:47,739
But let's face it, Alan,

208
00:09:47,761 --> 00:09:49,449
I went straight
from my mother's house

209
00:09:49,457 --> 00:09:50,588
to being married to Bridget;

210
00:09:50,606 --> 00:09:52,439
from Bridget to dating Zoey,

211
00:09:52,463 --> 00:09:53,863
and now I'm trying
to go from Zoey

212
00:09:53,907 --> 00:09:58,061
to a bunch of starving, crying,
gold-digging, crazy-ass bitches.

213
00:10:01,138 --> 00:10:02,793
Hey, if it weren't
for those women,

214
00:10:02,808 --> 00:10:04,407
I'd still be a virgin.

215
00:10:04,788 --> 00:10:06,810
And there'd be
no reality TV stars.

216
00:10:12,510 --> 00:10:14,645
Look, I'm just gonna
be alone for a while.

217
00:10:14,682 --> 00:10:17,300
And if the real thing
comes along, I'll know it.

218
00:10:17,304 --> 00:10:18,365
Hm, that's true.

219
00:10:18,378 --> 00:10:20,294
You know, I can still remember
the exact instant

220
00:10:20,315 --> 00:10:22,377
that I knew Lyndsey
was the one.

221
00:10:23,053 --> 00:10:24,016
How'd you know?

222
00:10:24,029 --> 00:10:25,449
Uh, she said, "I give up.

223
00:10:25,464 --> 00:10:27,003
You're the one."

224
00:10:30,243 --> 00:10:31,893
Hey, Walden.

225
00:10:31,908 --> 00:10:32,378
Hey.

226
00:10:32,388 --> 00:10:33,893
You here by yourself?

227
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:35,595
Yes, I'm alone.

228
00:10:35,623 --> 00:10:37,372
and I plan to stay that way.

229
00:10:37,403 --> 00:10:39,677
Oh, well,
if you change your mind,

230
00:10:39,679 --> 00:10:42,694
there's a bachelorette party
in the corner with a couple of

231
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:45,187
drunk and bitter
bridesmaids.

232
00:10:45,781 --> 00:10:47,696
Fish in a barrel.

233
00:10:48,158 --> 00:10:50,152
That's good to know,
but not tonight.

234
00:10:50,178 --> 00:10:52,288
All right.
What can I get you?

235
00:10:52,312 --> 00:10:53,408
I'll have a beer.

236
00:10:53,425 --> 00:10:54,659
Coming up.

237
00:10:55,170 --> 00:10:57,112
Excuse me.

238
00:10:58,081 --> 00:11:00,206
Can I have your nuts?

239
00:11:01,779 --> 00:11:02,912
What?

240
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:04,877
Your nuts.

241
00:11:11,054 --> 00:11:12,555
Thank you.

242
00:11:12,951 --> 00:11:15,844
- I'm Rose.
- Hi, Rose. I'm...

243
00:11:15,871 --> 00:11:17,604
Walden, I know.

244
00:11:17,630 --> 00:11:19,713
I heard the bartender
say "Hey, Walden."

245
00:11:19,731 --> 00:11:22,498
I mean, how else would
I know your name?

246
00:11:24,708 --> 00:11:26,320
It's nice to meet you, Rose.

247
00:11:26,338 --> 00:11:28,157
You too, Walden.

248
00:11:30,394 --> 00:11:32,517
I prefer real books.

249
00:11:33,743 --> 00:11:36,541
- Some people do.
- You know why I do?

250
00:11:36,576 --> 00:11:39,280
Because if you use this
to fix a wobbly table

251
00:11:39,306 --> 00:11:41,174
it costs you $800?

252
00:11:41,258 --> 00:11:43,908
No, you can't hide
a gun in an iPad.

253
00:11:45,979 --> 00:11:48,612
No, I guess you can't.

254
00:11:48,728 --> 00:11:50,755
Sorry.
I'll leave you alone.

255
00:11:50,832 --> 00:11:52,289
Thanks.

256
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:00,470
Oh, my God, are you okay?

257
00:12:00,496 --> 00:12:02,017
Nut. I can't breathe.

258
00:12:02,039 --> 00:12:03,734
Okay, don't panic.

259
00:12:07,015 --> 00:12:08,549
Oh.

260
00:12:08,669 --> 00:12:10,835
Thank you.
You saved my life.

261
00:12:10,989 --> 00:12:13,025
Can we get a glass of water
over here?

262
00:12:13,046 --> 00:12:15,234
And I'll have a martini.

263
00:12:18,282 --> 00:12:20,287
All right, I'm getting
ready to leave.

264
00:12:20,324 --> 00:12:22,008
Do you need anything
before I go?

265
00:12:22,024 --> 00:12:23,644
Mm, actually,
if you don't mind...

266
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:26,257
Just making small talk, Zippy.

267
00:12:27,666 --> 00:12:28,516
Hey.

268
00:12:28,565 --> 00:12:29,932
Hey, how was your night?

269
00:12:29,968 --> 00:12:30,919
Great.

270
00:12:30,944 --> 00:12:33,436
In fact, I met a girl.

271
00:12:33,438 --> 00:12:34,691
Of course you did.

272
00:12:34,707 --> 00:12:37,041
I hate you, but I hate me more.

273
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,507
This girl's
really interesting.

274
00:12:39,522 --> 00:12:42,234
Actually, I think you know her.
Her name is Rose.

275
00:12:42,271 --> 00:12:44,190
See ya.

276
00:12:46,004 --> 00:12:47,350
Wa— Rose?

277
00:12:47,352 --> 00:12:48,584
Crazy Rose?

278
00:12:48,586 --> 00:12:49,752
She's not crazy.

279
00:12:49,754 --> 00:12:51,387
And you know what?
Name-calling is cruel.

280
00:12:51,389 --> 00:12:53,756
How would you like it if
somebody called you Old Alan,

281
00:12:53,758 --> 00:12:55,687
or Cheap Alan, or Loser Alan?

282
00:12:55,702 --> 00:12:57,722
Somebody does!

283
00:12:59,286 --> 00:13:01,415
Did Rose tell you
she was stalking my brother?

284
00:13:01,427 --> 00:13:03,063
Actually,
she told me everything.

285
00:13:03,084 --> 00:13:05,476
You know, she was in love
with him, and I get it,

286
00:13:05,494 --> 00:13:08,307
When you're in love with someone,
love makes you do crazy things.

287
00:13:08,339 --> 00:13:11,139
No, crazy makes you
do crazy things.

288
00:13:11,177 --> 00:13:12,944
We all have skeletons
in our closets.

289
00:13:12,966 --> 00:13:15,751
Uh, yes, but in her case,
they may be actual skeletons.

290
00:13:16,659 --> 00:13:18,926
You know what? She told me
you were gonna do this.

291
00:13:18,948 --> 00:13:20,293
Of course she did.

292
00:13:20,310 --> 00:13:21,859
She's devious and deceptive.

293
00:13:21,881 --> 00:13:23,957
She's probably listening
to us right now.

294
00:13:23,974 --> 00:13:26,426
Hey, Rose!
How you doing?

295
00:13:27,688 --> 00:13:29,566
Alan, calm down.

296
00:13:29,577 --> 00:13:31,612
I had a conversation
with the woman.

297
00:13:31,629 --> 00:13:32,747
I'm not marrying her.

298
00:13:32,763 --> 00:13:34,566
I don't even know
if I'll ever see her again.

299
00:13:34,584 --> 00:13:36,923
Oh, you will, trust me.

300
00:13:37,289 --> 00:13:39,260
Her face will be
the last thing you see

301
00:13:39,275 --> 00:13:41,877
before you black out
from the chloroform.

302
00:13:48,606 --> 00:13:49,981
Rose?

303
00:13:50,002 --> 00:13:52,309
Oh, Walden, Hi.

304
00:13:52,436 --> 00:13:53,541
Hi.

305
00:13:53,736 --> 00:13:56,438
Wait a minute.
You're not stalking me, are you?

306
00:13:56,453 --> 00:13:59,192
Good one. No, I stop here every day
on my way to work.

307
00:13:59,221 --> 00:14:00,553
It's kind of a ritual.

308
00:14:00,570 --> 00:14:01,689
Really?

309
00:14:01,711 --> 00:14:04,339
There is no way
I would ever have known that.

310
00:14:05,205 --> 00:14:06,420
Do you mind if I join you?

311
00:14:06,431 --> 00:14:08,465
Please.
How can I say no to the man

312
00:14:08,467 --> 00:14:10,899
who saved me
from choking on his nuts?

313
00:14:17,258 --> 00:14:19,836
I told Alan that we met.
Boy, did you call that one.

314
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:21,341
Oh, let me guess.

315
00:14:21,356 --> 00:14:22,556
At some point did he say,

316
00:14:22,563 --> 00:14:24,594
"She's probably listening
to us right now.

317
00:14:24,611 --> 00:14:26,932
"Hey, Rose!
How you doing?"

318
00:14:28,457 --> 00:14:30,126
It's like you were there.

319
00:14:30,154 --> 00:14:32,090
But I wasn't.

320
00:14:32,455 --> 00:14:34,855
Well, he is very
suspicious of you.

321
00:14:34,885 --> 00:14:37,164
He thinks you have
some kind of plan.

322
00:14:37,195 --> 00:14:39,184
Are you suspicious of me?

323
00:14:39,207 --> 00:14:41,474
I'm more curious
than suspicious.

324
00:14:41,533 --> 00:14:44,561
Good, because that's my plan.

325
00:14:45,036 --> 00:14:48,270
Does your plan include
having dinner with me?

326
00:14:49,549 --> 00:14:51,508
Oh, gee,

327
00:14:51,573 --> 00:14:54,102
I don't know about that.
Why not?

328
00:14:54,134 --> 00:14:56,013
You live in Charlie's old house,

329
00:14:56,015 --> 00:14:58,504
there's Alan...
lots of baggage.

330
00:14:58,543 --> 00:15:01,112
None of that stuff
has anything to do with us.

331
00:15:01,348 --> 00:15:02,802
That's true.

332
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:05,054
So, what do you say? Dinner?

333
00:15:06,326 --> 00:15:07,939
Okay.

334
00:15:07,965 --> 00:15:09,661
To dinner.

335
00:15:09,681 --> 00:15:10,746
It'll be nice to go out

336
00:15:10,770 --> 00:15:13,082
with someone normal
for a change.

337
00:15:20,879 --> 00:15:22,479
Hello, Alan.

338
00:15:23,946 --> 00:15:25,058
Rose.

339
00:15:25,114 --> 00:15:27,290
You've got a lot of nerve
coming to this house.

340
00:15:27,327 --> 00:15:29,847
As much nerve as you have
still living in it?

341
00:15:30,690 --> 00:15:32,458
Touché.

342
00:15:32,612 --> 00:15:35,287
Wow, This place looks fantastic.

343
00:15:35,771 --> 00:15:38,538
Don't act like
you haven't seen it before.

344
00:15:38,569 --> 00:15:39,936
I know what you're up to.

345
00:15:39,950 --> 00:15:41,983
Oh, really? What am I up to?

346
00:15:42,196 --> 00:15:44,698
All right, I don't know
specifically what you're up to.

347
00:15:44,802 --> 00:15:47,340
But Walden is my best friend,
and I will not let you hurt him.

348
00:15:47,375 --> 00:15:49,361
And he's very lucky
to have a friend like you,

349
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:50,814
given what he's been through.

350
00:15:50,829 --> 00:15:53,101
Which you know because
you've been spying on us.

351
00:15:53,127 --> 00:15:54,960
J'accuse!

352
00:15:56,638 --> 00:15:57,667
No.

353
00:15:57,684 --> 00:15:59,784
I know because he told me.

354
00:15:59,807 --> 00:16:01,473
He's very fond of you, Alan.

355
00:16:01,498 --> 00:16:04,299
You finally made a friend;
don't screw it up.

356
00:16:04,819 --> 00:16:06,659
Oh, you're good.

357
00:16:07,748 --> 00:16:10,450
I'm totally confused right now.

358
00:16:10,704 --> 00:16:12,558
Ah, there she is.

359
00:16:12,591 --> 00:16:13,924
Hi, Walden.

360
00:16:13,952 --> 00:16:15,508
Are you two playing nice?

361
00:16:15,537 --> 00:16:17,170
Well, I am.
I don't know what she's up to,

362
00:16:17,194 --> 00:16:18,612
but I know it ends with
the audience yelling,

363
00:16:18,631 --> 00:16:20,497
"Don't go in the cellar!"

364
00:16:20,948 --> 00:16:22,063
You're funny.

365
00:16:22,085 --> 00:16:24,205
He thinks I've hatched
some nefarious plot.

366
00:16:24,221 --> 00:16:25,542
Are you after my money?

367
00:16:25,556 --> 00:16:27,718
No, you're
thinking of Alan.

368
00:16:30,668 --> 00:16:33,127
Are you planning on cloning me

369
00:16:33,148 --> 00:16:34,928
and running my
doppelganger for president,

370
00:16:34,955 --> 00:16:37,144
so you can be the puppet
master of the nation?

371
00:16:37,185 --> 00:16:38,513
Guilty.

372
00:16:38,533 --> 00:16:40,571
Better get a sample
right now.

373
00:16:41,633 --> 00:16:44,101
I get it— hair, DNA,
the whole...

374
00:16:45,568 --> 00:16:47,466
Just stop worrying.

375
00:16:47,498 --> 00:16:49,302
Don't you have somewhere
you need to be?

376
00:16:49,318 --> 00:16:51,621
Well, as a matter of fact,
Lyndsey and I are going to the movies.

377
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:54,283
- Have a good time.
- Oh, you'd like that, wouldn't you?

378
00:16:56,081 --> 00:16:58,166
Watch yourself, buddy.

379
00:16:59,926 --> 00:17:01,762
- He means well.
- I know.

380
00:17:01,802 --> 00:17:03,371
Can I pour you a
glass of wine?

381
00:17:03,391 --> 00:17:05,533
- Yeah, that'd be great.
- All right.

382
00:17:05,699 --> 00:17:07,443
Aha!

383
00:17:09,630 --> 00:17:12,100
Actually, I just forgot my keys.

384
00:17:12,748 --> 00:17:14,684
And your wallet.

385
00:17:22,422 --> 00:17:25,858
I shouldn't have eaten
that whole tub of popcorn.

386
00:17:25,906 --> 00:17:28,034
I'm gonna be
gassy all night.

387
00:17:28,616 --> 00:17:31,313
You know it's gonna take more
than a bloated belly

388
00:17:31,342 --> 00:17:34,144
to put a muzzle on Mr. Pokey.

389
00:17:34,184 --> 00:17:36,583
What was that?

390
00:17:36,601 --> 00:17:39,607
I don't know, but I've got
a bad feeling about this.

391
00:17:41,359 --> 00:17:43,646
I've got a bad feeling
about this.

392
00:17:48,206 --> 00:17:49,291
Walden?

393
00:17:50,675 --> 00:17:51,707
What?

394
00:17:53,062 --> 00:17:55,014
I'm coming in.

395
00:17:59,814 --> 00:18:01,237
Don't worry, buddy.

396
00:18:01,239 --> 00:18:03,205
I told you she was nuts.

397
00:18:03,207 --> 00:18:04,734
Get out of here!

398
00:18:04,758 --> 00:18:06,099
- What?
- Get out of here.

399
00:18:06,112 --> 00:18:08,312
I'm having the best sex
of my life.

400
00:18:10,063 --> 00:18:12,046
Oh, hi, Alan.

401
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:14,036
How was the movie?

402
00:18:14,061 --> 00:18:16,780
It was... Wait, is
that a leaf blower?

403
00:18:16,972 --> 00:18:19,811
That's not what they call it
in Amsterdam.

404
00:18:40,432 --> 00:18:42,272
Oh.

405
00:18:44,268 --> 00:18:46,070
Hi, Jake.

406
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:48,227
Rose?
What are you doing there?

407
00:18:48,276 --> 00:18:50,495
I'm dating Walden.

408
00:18:51,246 --> 00:18:53,490
I should've seen that coming.

409
00:18:53,523 --> 00:18:55,128
How's the army treating you?

410
00:18:55,139 --> 00:18:56,715
How'd you know I was
in the army?

411
00:18:56,736 --> 00:18:58,501
'Cause I've been spying
on you guys.

412
00:18:58,509 --> 00:18:59,512
What?

413
00:18:59,535 --> 00:19:02,540
I'm just kidding.
You're wearing a uniform, silly.

414
00:19:02,665 --> 00:19:04,858
Oh, yeah, right.

415
00:19:05,027 --> 00:19:06,919
And don't worry
about the obstacle course.

416
00:19:06,929 --> 00:19:08,028
You'll get it.

417
00:19:08,039 --> 00:19:11,207
Yeah, the rope climb is...
Hey, wait a second, how did you...?

418
00:19:11,238 --> 00:19:13,674
Got to go, Jake.
I'll tell your dad you called.

419
00:19:16,431 --> 00:19:19,651
How did I know
he was in the army? So cute.

420
00:19:22,432 --> 00:19:26,432
