00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:08,902
Hey, buddy.

2
00:00:08,927 --> 00:00:09,820
Hey, Dad.

3
00:00:09,831 --> 00:00:10,963
Long time no talk.

4
00:00:10,974 --> 00:00:12,273
I was starting to think
maybe you weren't

5
00:00:12,283 --> 00:00:13,564
a part of this family anymore.

6
00:00:13,603 --> 00:00:16,387
What? I'm not that easy
to get rid of.

7
00:00:16,438 --> 00:00:18,287
Just been really busy lately,
you know,

8
00:00:18,315 --> 00:00:20,199
spending a lot of time
with my girlfriend.

9
00:00:20,214 --> 00:00:23,059
Oh, please, tell me it's not
the 35-year-old single mother

10
00:00:23,079 --> 00:00:24,119
with the two kids.

11
00:00:24,147 --> 00:00:27,395
No, Tammy's 36,
and she has three kids.

12
00:00:28,184 --> 00:00:30,685
Jake, she's almost
twice your age.

13
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:32,949
No, she's not; I'm 19.

14
00:00:32,967 --> 00:00:34,305
Geez, do the math.

15
00:00:34,378 --> 00:00:36,810
How well do you even know
this woman?

16
00:00:36,843 --> 00:00:38,626
Enough to know that I love her.

17
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,006
Jake, slow down.
I'm just not sure

18
00:00:40,023 --> 00:00:41,924
that you know
what you're getting into.

19
00:00:41,938 --> 00:00:43,080
You always do this.

20
00:00:43,097 --> 00:00:45,047
You think every decision I make
is wrong.

21
00:00:45,067 --> 00:00:47,050
You're wrong about that.

22
00:00:47,064 --> 00:00:48,836
You've already made up your mind
about Tammy,

23
00:00:48,838 --> 00:00:50,037
and you don't even know her.

24
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:51,422
Let me ask you this question.

25
00:00:51,424 --> 00:00:54,309
If you've never tasted
a strawberry ice cream cone

26
00:00:54,311 --> 00:00:56,912
in your life, how do you know
what it tastes like?

27
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:58,159
What?

28
00:00:58,481 --> 00:01:01,733
My point is,
you've never licked Tammy.

29
00:01:06,302 --> 00:01:08,616
I don't know
how to respond to that.

30
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:09,613
Yeah, you don't.

31
00:01:09,622 --> 00:01:11,143
She's delicious.

32
00:01:11,183 --> 00:01:13,633
Fine, why don't you bring her
up here so I can meet her.

33
00:01:13,654 --> 00:01:15,337
Okay, I will.
Good.

34
00:01:15,361 --> 00:01:16,560
I've got leave next weekend.

35
00:01:16,578 --> 00:01:17,661
You know where I live.

36
00:01:17,684 --> 00:01:19,934
Yeah, someone else's house.

37
00:01:22,599 --> 00:01:25,437

but he cuts deep.

00:01:54,028 --> 00:01:57,136
Well, I've got Jake's room
all ready for this weekend.

41
00:01:57,170 --> 00:01:58,814
You know, just
out of curiosity,

42
00:01:58,822 --> 00:02:01,212
when are we going to stop
calling it "Jake's room"?

43
00:02:01,232 --> 00:02:03,199
'Cause I'd really like it to be
referred to as

44
00:02:03,206 --> 00:02:07,377
"Walden's gym"
or "Walden's home theater,"

45
00:02:07,409 --> 00:02:11,411
or "Walden's room to do whatever
the hell he wants with it."

46
00:02:11,566 --> 00:02:13,483
Look, I don't mean
to split hairs,

47
00:02:13,513 --> 00:02:16,430
but a room can't really be both
a gym and a home theater.

48
00:02:16,448 --> 00:02:19,208
That's why
I also need "Alan's room."

49
00:02:20,398 --> 00:02:21,315
Touché.

50
00:02:21,425 --> 00:02:22,670
Truthé.

51
00:02:23,501 --> 00:02:25,597
Will you stop
futzing with my desk?

52
00:02:25,613 --> 00:02:27,030
I'm sorry, I'm
sorry, I'm just...

53
00:02:27,045 --> 00:02:28,959
I'm nervous about meeting
Jake's girlfriend.

54
00:02:28,978 --> 00:02:30,544
I mean,
he's obsessed with this woman.

55
00:02:30,562 --> 00:02:32,562
It's like he's been brainwashed
by some cult.

56
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:34,614
What guy hasn't?

57
00:02:37,347 --> 00:02:39,597
I'm sorry, you said "cult."

58
00:02:42,677 --> 00:02:44,411
You're enjoying this,
aren't you?

59
00:02:44,413 --> 00:02:46,581
Yep, I got to get something
out of you living here.

60
00:02:46,597 --> 00:02:48,342
You don't pay rent.

61
00:02:49,759 --> 00:02:52,410
Listen, I think you're getting
all worked up over nothing.

62
00:02:52,437 --> 00:02:54,577
Nothing? She's 36 years old.

63
00:02:54,602 --> 00:02:55,735
So? I'm 34.

64
00:02:55,752 --> 00:02:58,846
Yeah, and I don't want you
dating my son, either.

65
00:02:59,731 --> 00:03:00,542
Ouch.

66
00:03:02,086 --> 00:03:03,406
That's probably them.

67
00:03:03,419 --> 00:03:04,356
It can't be.

68
00:03:04,368 --> 00:03:05,953
Jake wouldn't ring the bell.

69
00:03:14,742 --> 00:03:16,854
Um, h-hello?

70
00:03:17,224 --> 00:03:18,527
Hey, Dad.

71
00:03:18,539 --> 00:03:20,556
Uh, this is my girlfriend,
Tammy.

72
00:03:20,577 --> 00:03:22,197
Uh, Tammy, this is my dad, Alan.

73
00:03:22,212 --> 00:03:23,345
It's a pleasure
to meet you.

74
00:03:23,355 --> 00:03:24,467
Likewise.
Come in.

75
00:03:24,474 --> 00:03:26,146
Wow!

76
00:03:26,169 --> 00:03:28,119
Yeah, it would take
the jaws of life

77
00:03:28,135 --> 00:03:29,685
to get me out of this house.

78
00:03:30,206 --> 00:03:32,856
Look, you already have
something in common.

79
00:03:33,394 --> 00:03:34,937
I'm, uh, Walden Schmidt.

80
00:03:34,956 --> 00:03:37,445
Good God,
you're prettier than I am.

81
00:03:38,225 --> 00:03:39,831
That's quite the grip.

82
00:03:39,856 --> 00:03:42,771
Yeah. I milked cows
when I was a kid.

83
00:03:43,031 --> 00:03:45,038
Then I discovered boys.

84
00:03:46,109 --> 00:03:47,973
I'm just kidding.

85
00:03:48,053 --> 00:03:49,843
Not really.

86
00:03:50,411 --> 00:03:52,939
This really is an
amazing house though.

87
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:54,017
Thank you.

88
00:03:54,046 --> 00:03:56,747
Be much nicer with
a home theater.

89
00:03:56,785 --> 00:03:59,140
But, uh, I've been
very fortunate.

90
00:03:59,149 --> 00:04:00,495
Yeah, so I've heard.

91
00:04:00,527 --> 00:04:03,149
Jake tells me
you're stupid rich.

92
00:04:03,867 --> 00:04:07,299
He tells me
you're very resourceful.

93
00:04:08,588 --> 00:04:10,535
I'll take that as a compliment.

94
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,576
Please, make yourselves
at home. Have a seat.

95
00:04:12,587 --> 00:04:14,559
Is there anything I can
get you to eat or drink?

96
00:04:14,572 --> 00:04:16,265
Oh, I'd love a drink,

97
00:04:16,289 --> 00:04:18,782
but it would set off
my ankle bracelet.

98
00:04:19,688 --> 00:04:21,086
Not really.

99
00:04:21,178 --> 00:04:23,917
I got that sucker
off a week ago.

100
00:04:24,401 --> 00:04:25,734
You hear that, Walden?

101
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:27,298
She just got
her ankle bracelet off.

102
00:04:27,313 --> 00:04:30,111
I don't see how this
could get any better.

103
00:04:30,626 --> 00:04:32,254
Oh, oh, oh!

104
00:04:33,144 --> 00:04:35,374
It just got better!

105
00:04:36,761 --> 00:04:39,188
Well... look at you.

106
00:04:39,231 --> 00:04:41,583
Uh, now,
where would a skull be going

107
00:04:41,615 --> 00:04:43,917
that he would
even need a top hat?

108
00:04:44,031 --> 00:04:46,320
Oh, he might be going
to visit Yosemite Sam.

109
00:04:46,347 --> 00:04:47,218
Mm.

110
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:49,565
Yeah, they're kind
of my business cards.

111
00:04:49,581 --> 00:04:51,363
I own a tattoo parlor.

112
00:04:51,376 --> 00:04:53,350
Oh, did you hear that, Walden?

113
00:04:53,369 --> 00:04:55,528
She owns a tattoo parlor.

114
00:04:55,631 --> 00:04:57,281
That sounds fun.

115
00:04:57,358 --> 00:05:00,039
Yeah, it's called
Tammy's Tatties.

116
00:05:01,279 --> 00:05:03,887
It makes guys
think of boobs.

117
00:05:04,735 --> 00:05:05,985
Thank you.

118
00:05:06,438 --> 00:05:09,064
Speaking of which,
in case you forget,

119
00:05:09,081 --> 00:05:10,914
my name's
written right here.

120
00:05:10,934 --> 00:05:12,484
Nice.

121
00:05:12,524 --> 00:05:14,140
What's the other
one called?

122
00:05:15,964 --> 00:05:17,284
I like you.

123
00:05:17,311 --> 00:05:19,437
I like you, too.

124
00:05:20,697 --> 00:05:23,149
Everybody likes everybody.

125
00:05:24,672 --> 00:05:27,242
So, so, so, how'd
you two meet?

126
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:28,872
Oh, Jake came
into my shop.

127
00:05:28,894 --> 00:05:29,926
Tammy's Tatties.

128
00:05:29,928 --> 00:05:31,563
Exactly. See, once
you get it in your head,

129
00:05:31,583 --> 00:05:32,716
you can't get it out.

130
00:05:32,742 --> 00:05:34,882
No, you cannot.

131
00:05:35,183 --> 00:05:37,100
Yeah, a couple of us
guys from the base

132
00:05:37,102 --> 00:05:38,885
went out drinking, and
they bet me 100 bucks

133
00:05:38,887 --> 00:05:40,607
that I wouldn't get
this tattoo of two arms

134
00:05:40,631 --> 00:05:42,975
coming out of my butt crack.
Like, you know,

135
00:05:42,998 --> 00:05:45,067
Someone was trying to escape.

136
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:46,464
Oh, Jake, you didn't.

137
00:05:46,489 --> 00:05:48,342
No, Tammy
wouldn't let me.

138
00:05:48,363 --> 00:05:50,320
Damn right.
Thank you for that.

139
00:05:50,344 --> 00:05:52,262
I took one look at his ass
and I thought,

140
00:05:52,285 --> 00:05:54,964
I don't want to tattoo that,
I want to bite that.

141
00:06:00,932 --> 00:06:02,074
Chomp.

142
00:06:06,999 --> 00:06:08,582
Hey, what's going on?

143
00:06:08,603 --> 00:06:10,623
Jake made pizza bagels.

144
00:06:10,643 --> 00:06:13,482
I make them for Tammy's kids
all the time.

145
00:06:13,516 --> 00:06:16,130
Is it breakfast? Is it lunch?

146
00:06:16,176 --> 00:06:18,058
Is it pizza? Is it a bagel?

147
00:06:18,093 --> 00:06:20,907
I'll tell you what it is,
it's delightful.

148
00:06:21,364 --> 00:06:23,802
So, uh, how does
that work exactly?

149
00:06:23,813 --> 00:06:25,464
Is, uh, Tammy's ex
in the picture?

150
00:06:25,489 --> 00:06:26,589
He's in some.

151
00:06:26,612 --> 00:06:28,779
And in some,
his head's been torn off.

152
00:06:29,426 --> 00:06:31,913
But was I right or what?
Isn't Tammy awesome?

153
00:06:31,949 --> 00:06:35,116
She seems great, but still,
you have to acknowledge

154
00:06:35,143 --> 00:06:37,023
that this is
an unusual relationship.

155
00:06:37,038 --> 00:06:39,583
I mean, she's old enough
to have you as her kid.

156
00:06:39,598 --> 00:06:41,465
So what?
You are, too.

157
00:06:41,477 --> 00:06:43,467
He's got a point.

158
00:06:43,502 --> 00:06:46,336
Doesn't make any sense,
but it's a point.

159
00:06:46,416 --> 00:06:48,749
I just want to be sure
you know what you're doing.

160
00:06:48,768 --> 00:06:49,907
That's the beauty of it.

161
00:06:49,916 --> 00:06:52,676
When I don't know
what I'm doing, she shows me.

162
00:06:54,345 --> 00:06:56,621
Two-zero, Jake.

163
00:06:57,753 --> 00:07:00,257
Face it, Dad,
I'm not a kid anymore.

164
00:07:00,281 --> 00:07:02,790
Oh, baby,
you got a milk moustache.

165
00:07:02,834 --> 00:07:04,485
You ready to go?

166
00:07:04,510 --> 00:07:05,100
Yep.

167
00:07:05,117 --> 00:07:06,283
Where you
guys heading?

168
00:07:06,298 --> 00:07:07,692
Oh, we're gonna do
a little shopping,

169
00:07:07,699 --> 00:07:09,453
pick up some souvenirs
for my kids

170
00:07:09,467 --> 00:07:11,286
and pick up a new nipple gun.

171
00:07:12,087 --> 00:07:13,855
N-Nipple gun?

172
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:15,468
Yeah, for piercing.

173
00:07:15,490 --> 00:07:18,837
You give me a body part,
I can paint it, pierce it or plug it.

174
00:07:19,987 --> 00:07:21,988
I really like her.

175
00:07:22,331 --> 00:07:25,271
Good, 'cause I want to pick
your brain, Mr. Moneybags.

176
00:07:25,299 --> 00:07:26,373
Go ahead.

177
00:07:26,389 --> 00:07:28,150
Well, I'm looking for
a stable investment

178
00:07:28,167 --> 00:07:29,191
for my pension plan.

179
00:07:29,204 --> 00:07:31,400
Do you think Google's
business model is sustainable

180
00:07:31,419 --> 00:07:33,431
over a 20-year period?

181
00:07:35,298 --> 00:07:38,504
Tell you what, while you're out,
I'll Google it.

182
00:07:38,604 --> 00:07:40,705
You're funny.

183
00:07:40,726 --> 00:07:41,789
Come on, babe.
All right.

184
00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:43,059
See you, guys.

185
00:07:43,276 --> 00:07:45,226
This makes no sense.

186
00:07:45,242 --> 00:07:46,322
What are you
talking about?

187
00:07:46,335 --> 00:07:48,198
She's beautiful,
she's cool, she's smart.

188
00:07:48,214 --> 00:07:50,697
Exactly. What the hell's
she doing with Jake?

189
00:07:50,964 --> 00:07:52,764
Besides doing him?

190
00:07:52,944 --> 00:07:54,166
You're not helping.

191
00:07:54,178 --> 00:07:55,989
I'm not trying to.

192
00:08:04,495 --> 00:08:05,560
Wow.

193
00:08:07,601 --> 00:08:09,752
You ever get tired of this view?

194
00:08:09,885 --> 00:08:11,445
I do not.

195
00:08:11,468 --> 00:08:13,635
I've worked hard for it.

196
00:08:14,849 --> 00:08:16,477
Good one.

197
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,862
Can I ask you a question?

198
00:08:18,896 --> 00:08:19,775
Sure.

199
00:08:19,798 --> 00:08:22,182
What do you
hate about me the most?

200
00:08:22,214 --> 00:08:24,748
No, I don't, I don't hate
anything about you.

201
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:26,576
Oh, please.

202
00:08:26,794 --> 00:08:28,716
I've been in your shoes.

203
00:08:28,737 --> 00:08:31,763
My 17-year-old daughter
brought home a 32-year-old guy,

204
00:08:31,782 --> 00:08:33,024
and I chased that son of a bitch

205
00:08:33,037 --> 00:08:35,156
right out of the house
with a gun.

206
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:36,461
Oh, my God.

207
00:08:36,482 --> 00:08:38,482
Well, it was a nipple gun.

208
00:08:39,129 --> 00:08:40,995
Which explains
why I needed a new one,

209
00:08:41,011 --> 00:08:43,576
and also why I was wearing
an ankle bracelet.

210
00:08:44,904 --> 00:08:48,295
The point is, I get
what people think about me.

211
00:08:48,884 --> 00:08:51,207
And they're only looking
at the surface.

212
00:08:51,245 --> 00:08:53,867
Well, there's a
lot to look at.

213
00:08:54,648 --> 00:08:57,329
Look, here's all you need
to know about me.

214
00:08:57,682 --> 00:08:59,698
I'm raising three kids
by myself,

215
00:08:59,735 --> 00:09:02,292
I run a successful business,
and I own a three-bedroom house

216
00:09:02,315 --> 00:09:03,695
that's not on wheels.

217
00:09:03,724 --> 00:09:05,523
So, anybody who judges me
can kiss my ass

218
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:08,034
right on my tattoo
of Brad Paisley.

219
00:09:08,643 --> 00:09:10,762
I-I'm not judging you.
I just,

220
00:09:10,786 --> 00:09:13,708
I-I don't understand
why you're with Jake.

221
00:09:13,863 --> 00:09:16,675
I'm with him
because I care about him.

222
00:09:17,634 --> 00:09:20,582
I mean,
he's sweet and kind and funny.

223
00:09:21,643 --> 00:09:23,691
And I don't when
the last time you had sex

224
00:09:23,709 --> 00:09:26,994
with a 19-year-old boy was,
but it is a lot of fun.

225
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:32,138
Then eight minutes later,
it's a lot of fun again.

226
00:09:32,553 --> 00:09:35,609
Um, I'll-I'll take
your word for it.

227
00:09:36,224 --> 00:09:38,257
Alan, has anybody ever
looked at you

228
00:09:38,259 --> 00:09:40,676
like you were the greatest thing
on the planet?

229
00:09:40,738 --> 00:09:42,584
Do strippers count?

230
00:09:42,608 --> 00:09:44,913
No.
Then no.

231
00:09:45,299 --> 00:09:48,009
Well, that's the way
Jake looks at me.

232
00:09:49,312 --> 00:09:51,267
He thinks I can do no wrong,

233
00:09:51,289 --> 00:09:53,538
and he worships the ground
I walk on.

234
00:09:53,574 --> 00:09:56,700
Uh, to be fair, for a while,
he worshipped Twinkies.

235
00:09:56,735 --> 00:09:59,670
Yeah, yeah, he still does.

236
00:09:59,716 --> 00:10:02,079
But don't worry, I don't let him
have sugar past 9:00.

237
00:10:02,116 --> 00:10:03,269
Mm.

238
00:10:03,461 --> 00:10:06,345
The bottom line is,
I think your son is terrific.

239
00:10:07,285 --> 00:10:09,788
And I know what we have
isn't gonna last forever,

240
00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:12,294
but it's what I want in my life
right now.

241
00:10:12,639 --> 00:10:15,167
I'm really sorry
if you don't approve.

242
00:10:15,517 --> 00:10:17,503
Well, you have
to understand,

243
00:10:17,548 --> 00:10:19,268
Jake is still my...

244
00:10:20,384 --> 00:10:21,701
baby.

245
00:10:21,805 --> 00:10:23,283
I hear you.

246
00:10:23,549 --> 00:10:25,459
It's exactly what I told
the judge

247
00:10:25,490 --> 00:10:28,357
when he wanted to try
my oldest son as an adult.

248
00:10:29,529 --> 00:10:32,126
They're always your babies.

249
00:10:36,803 --> 00:10:37,636
Hey.

250
00:10:37,694 --> 00:10:38,329
Hey.

251
00:10:38,411 --> 00:10:39,594
You busy?

252
00:10:39,636 --> 00:10:42,133
I'm thinking about
getting a tattoo.

253
00:10:42,916 --> 00:10:44,366
How about this?

254
00:10:44,873 --> 00:10:47,623
It's just a bunch
of ones and zeroes.

255
00:10:47,905 --> 00:10:51,652
Yeah, it's my favorite
Gandhi quote in binary code.

256
00:10:52,673 --> 00:10:55,340
"You can never
imprison my mind"

257
00:10:55,372 --> 00:10:57,091
Why don't you just
get one that says,

258
00:10:57,112 --> 00:10:59,605
"I'm a nerd,
don't sleep with me"?

259
00:11:00,508 --> 00:11:02,748
Did you want
something?

260
00:11:02,975 --> 00:11:04,808
Yeah, I was wondering
if you know

261
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:06,496
why my dad's being
such a jerk.

262
00:11:06,505 --> 00:11:07,694
Oh, dads worry.

263
00:11:07,721 --> 00:11:09,092
That's their job.

264
00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:10,304
I'm practically a dad,

265
00:11:10,331 --> 00:11:13,199
and I don't act like that
toward my children.

266
00:11:13,546 --> 00:11:16,423
That's because you
respect your elders.

267
00:11:18,224 --> 00:11:21,245
Look, your dad just doesn't
want to see you get hurt.

268
00:11:21,395 --> 00:11:23,445
How am I gonna get hurt?

269
00:11:23,447 --> 00:11:24,709
Are you kidding me?

270
00:11:24,753 --> 00:11:28,805
Have you never seen a movie or
heard a song or read a poem?

271
00:11:29,003 --> 00:11:31,389
Uh, yes, yes and no.

272
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:34,840
Okay, listen, I think your
dad just needs a little time

273
00:11:34,868 --> 00:11:37,211
to get used to the idea of
you and Tammy being together.

274
00:11:37,244 --> 00:11:38,660
Yeah, well,
he'd better hurry,

275
00:11:38,677 --> 00:11:41,584
'cause tomorrow we're gonna
go to Vegas and get married.

276
00:11:42,508 --> 00:11:45,032
That should be
plenty of time.

277
00:11:50,274 --> 00:11:52,293
Oh, you can't
be serious.

278
00:11:52,334 --> 00:11:54,000
Are-are you really
getting married?

279
00:11:54,057 --> 00:11:56,637
Yeah, I mean,
assuming Tammy says yes.

280
00:11:56,667 --> 00:11:59,438
Oh, okay, you haven't
thought this through at all.

281
00:11:59,466 --> 00:12:01,012
No, I totally have.

282
00:12:01,034 --> 00:12:03,373
I've even started
on our vows, here.

283
00:12:03,903 --> 00:12:06,601
"I can't wait to start
our life together,

284
00:12:06,603 --> 00:12:08,853
"I like it when you dress
in leather.

285
00:12:10,227 --> 00:12:12,228
"I'll love you
forever and a day,

286
00:12:12,257 --> 00:12:14,984
You make me glad
I'm not gay."

287
00:12:15,982 --> 00:12:18,836
And you said
you've never read poetry.

288
00:12:18,865 --> 00:12:20,434
All right,
here, listen.

289
00:12:20,449 --> 00:12:22,064
You're too young to get married.

290
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:23,328
You got married at my age.

291
00:12:23,342 --> 00:12:24,275
Yeah, and look what happened.

292
00:12:24,287 --> 00:12:26,297
I lost my wife
and half my money,

293
00:12:26,329 --> 00:12:28,943
and the only thing I gained
was your father.

294
00:12:28,965 --> 00:12:30,719
I'm not going to argue
about this with you.

295
00:12:30,738 --> 00:12:32,280
Just don't say anything
to my dad, all right?

296
00:12:32,299 --> 00:12:34,044
You can't do this to me.

297
00:12:34,069 --> 00:12:35,611
I hate keeping secrets.

298
00:12:35,632 --> 00:12:37,730
Don't worry, I'll tell him
when the time is right.

299
00:12:37,753 --> 00:12:39,324
When, after you
get married?

300
00:12:39,352 --> 00:12:41,252
That's a good idea.
No.

301
00:12:41,285 --> 00:12:43,566
No, you-you need
to tell him before.

302
00:12:43,601 --> 00:12:44,750
That's not going
to happen,

303
00:12:44,757 --> 00:12:46,190
and you're not going
to tell him either.

304
00:12:46,192 --> 00:12:48,361
Okay, look, your dad
is my best friend,

305
00:12:48,394 --> 00:12:50,561
and you're putting me in
a very difficult position.

306
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:52,186
Hey, Tammy put me
in a difficult position

307
00:12:52,198 --> 00:12:54,502
the other night, too,
and it worked out great.

308
00:12:55,554 --> 00:12:56,168
Hey,

309
00:12:56,184 --> 00:12:58,017
why don't you just
tell your father?

310
00:12:58,037 --> 00:12:59,412
'Cause he'll just say it's a bad idea.

311
00:12:59,426 --> 00:13:02,424
You know why?
'Cause it's a bad idea!

312
00:13:02,459 --> 00:13:04,109
Jake, get back here!

313
00:13:04,138 --> 00:13:06,238
Do not do this to me!

314
00:13:06,277 --> 00:13:08,778
I just want a home theater.

315
00:13:12,031 --> 00:13:14,096
Hey, dinner's
almost ready.

316
00:13:14,521 --> 00:13:16,457
I'm gonna pass.

317
00:13:16,554 --> 00:13:18,453
What? You can't.

318
00:13:18,478 --> 00:13:19,745
Jake's making gnocchi.

319
00:13:19,762 --> 00:13:22,179
He's into cooking things
he can't spell.

320
00:13:22,252 --> 00:13:23,675
What's for dessert— cake?

321
00:13:24,514 --> 00:13:25,780
Pie.

322
00:13:27,214 --> 00:13:28,465
Come on, join us.

323
00:13:28,477 --> 00:13:31,028
No, no,
it's-it's a family thing.

324
00:13:31,050 --> 00:13:33,388
I don't want to...
get in the middle of it.

325
00:13:33,806 --> 00:13:36,136
Oh, oh, there's nothing
to get in the middle of.

326
00:13:36,159 --> 00:13:38,236
I, uh, I had a nice
conversation with Tammy,

327
00:13:38,267 --> 00:13:40,595
and she knows this thing
with Jake isn't serious.

328
00:13:40,617 --> 00:13:41,633
Does Jake know that?

329
00:13:41,647 --> 00:13:43,480
Well, I assume he does.

330
00:13:43,518 --> 00:13:45,701
Why, did he say
something to you?

331
00:13:46,419 --> 00:13:48,305
Did... he say something?

332
00:13:48,346 --> 00:13:50,096
Why would he say
something to me? I...

333
00:13:50,123 --> 00:13:51,321
Let's go eat.

334
00:13:51,343 --> 00:13:53,257
I-I thought
you didn't want to eat.

335
00:13:53,275 --> 00:13:55,026
I changed my mind,
just like you did.

336
00:13:55,034 --> 00:13:56,328
You didn't like Tammy,
now you do.

337
00:13:56,346 --> 00:13:58,709
Who knows what's going
to happen next? Not me.

338
00:14:01,517 --> 00:14:02,775
Oh.

339
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,633
Quarters.

340
00:14:06,782 --> 00:14:09,447
He's a billionaire,
he's not going to miss it.

341
00:14:13,573 --> 00:14:16,043
Jake, this gnocchi
is amazing.

342
00:14:16,077 --> 00:14:18,855
Yeah, I like to make it
'cause it sounds like "nookie."

343
00:14:20,903 --> 00:14:21,903
Get it?

344
00:14:22,295 --> 00:14:23,515
I do.

345
00:14:23,819 --> 00:14:25,520
Not as much as I do.

346
00:14:30,084 --> 00:14:33,553
So, uh, Tammy, where did you
learn the art of tattooing?

347
00:14:33,624 --> 00:14:34,790
Prison.

348
00:14:36,135 --> 00:14:37,173
I'm kidding.

349
00:14:37,195 --> 00:14:38,445
Juvie.

350
00:14:38,913 --> 00:14:40,130
Kidding?

351
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:41,232
Nope.

352
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:44,727
Jakey, you haven't even touched
your asparagus.

353
00:14:44,747 --> 00:14:46,071
I don't like
asparagus.

354
00:14:46,107 --> 00:14:48,217
Then, why'd you make it?
'Cause you like it.

355
00:14:48,236 --> 00:14:49,760
Don't try to butter
me up, young man.

356
00:14:49,774 --> 00:14:51,486
Eat your vegetables.
I don't wanna.

357
00:14:51,501 --> 00:14:52,904
Jake, listen to your mo...

358
00:14:53,785 --> 00:14:55,552
arvelous girlfriend.

359
00:14:56,123 --> 00:14:58,508
Look, just take
a few tiny bites.

360
00:14:58,537 --> 00:14:59,650
Do I have to?

361
00:14:59,665 --> 00:15:00,664
It's delicious.

362
00:15:00,682 --> 00:15:01,635
Yeah, it really is.

363
00:15:01,649 --> 00:15:03,783
Did you know
that the asparagus plant,

364
00:15:03,803 --> 00:15:05,186
uh, dates back
to ancient...

365
00:15:05,207 --> 00:15:07,857
Jake's taking Tammy to Vegas
to get married!

366
00:15:10,061 --> 00:15:11,145
Rome.

367
00:15:12,163 --> 00:15:13,946
What the hell, dude?

368
00:15:13,979 --> 00:15:16,435
I told you,
I'm not good with secrets.

369
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:17,664
Baby, you want
to get married?

370
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:18,893
Uh, no, no, no,
he doesn't.

371
00:15:18,905 --> 00:15:20,704
Yes, he does.

372
00:15:21,343 --> 00:15:23,784
I can't wait
for our life together,

373
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:25,333
I like it
when you dress in le...

374
00:15:25,351 --> 00:15:26,544
No-Nobody's getting married.

375
00:15:26,562 --> 00:15:28,745
We are, 'cause we love
each other, right?

376
00:15:28,765 --> 00:15:29,855
Damn right we do.

377
00:15:29,871 --> 00:15:32,267
I thought you were just
using him for his body!

378
00:15:32,299 --> 00:15:33,465
You said that?

379
00:15:33,481 --> 00:15:34,918
You're so sweet.

380
00:15:34,945 --> 00:15:36,278
N-N-N-No!

381
00:15:36,309 --> 00:15:38,980
I am not going to let you throw
your life away like this!

382
00:15:39,027 --> 00:15:40,926
Wait, which one of us
are you talking to?

383
00:15:40,950 --> 00:15:42,533
My son, the idiot.

384
00:15:42,553 --> 00:15:45,361
Oh, so, because he wants
to marry me, he's an idiot?

385
00:15:45,383 --> 00:15:46,748
Uh, to be fair,

386
00:15:46,774 --> 00:15:49,610
he was an idiot
long before he met you.

387
00:15:49,662 --> 00:15:51,429
I don't need you
to defend me.

388
00:15:51,458 --> 00:15:53,607
Come on, Tammy,
let's get out of here.

389
00:15:53,624 --> 00:15:55,982
Oh, Jake, you can't
possibly be this stupid.

390
00:15:56,001 --> 00:15:57,712
You know, it doesn't matter
what you think of me.

391
00:15:57,729 --> 00:15:58,779
But why the hell
do you have

392
00:15:58,789 --> 00:16:01,122
such a low opinion
of your son?

393
00:16:02,076 --> 00:16:04,366
Because I know him!

394
00:16:06,057 --> 00:16:07,854
Could be worse.

395
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:09,658
He could be one
of those showbiz kids

396
00:16:09,676 --> 00:16:11,626
who goes off the rails.

397
00:16:16,507 --> 00:16:19,298
All right, there's
a 24-hour chapel in Vegas.

398
00:16:19,322 --> 00:16:22,023
If we hurry, we can get there
before it closes.

399
00:16:22,153 --> 00:16:24,195
Yeah, I don't think
we should go to Vegas.

400
00:16:24,224 --> 00:16:25,491
Why not?

401
00:16:26,141 --> 00:16:27,499
A wedding's supposed to be about

402
00:16:27,527 --> 00:16:30,044
bringing a family together,
not breaking it apart.

403
00:16:30,066 --> 00:16:31,149
Hang on a sec.

404
00:16:31,165 --> 00:16:33,443
You were just as mad
at my dad as I was,

405
00:16:33,467 --> 00:16:34,814
and now you're on his side?

406
00:16:34,829 --> 00:16:35,912
I'm not choosing sides.

407
00:16:35,933 --> 00:16:38,595
Your dad's a tool
with a bad haircut.

408
00:16:38,646 --> 00:16:40,979
But I'm just saying, if
we were to get married,

409
00:16:41,001 --> 00:16:42,877
I would want the
whole family there—

410
00:16:42,896 --> 00:16:46,624
my kids, your dad, the guy
your dad sponges off of.

411
00:16:46,966 --> 00:16:49,262
Yeah, well,
I don't want him there.

412
00:16:49,281 --> 00:16:51,627
You know, Jake, you're
lucky you have a dad.

413
00:16:51,656 --> 00:16:53,600
When I was five, mine
went out for a sandwich

414
00:16:53,611 --> 00:16:55,359
and never came back.

415
00:16:55,379 --> 00:16:57,093
What kind of sandwich?

416
00:16:57,860 --> 00:16:58,988
What?

417
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:01,277
Sorry, we left
in the middle of dinner.

418
00:17:01,290 --> 00:17:03,207
I'm still kind of hungry.

419
00:17:03,241 --> 00:17:05,631
Look, the point is, I
don't want to be the cause

420
00:17:05,651 --> 00:17:07,818
of an estrangement between
you and your father.

421
00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:11,205
Don't worry, my dad was pretty
estrange before he met you.

422
00:17:12,158 --> 00:17:15,144
Okay, look, let's approach
this from a different angle.

423
00:17:15,284 --> 00:17:16,423
Sit.

424
00:17:19,322 --> 00:17:21,957
I think, before we do
anything else,

425
00:17:21,999 --> 00:17:24,166
you need to make things right
with your dad.

426
00:17:24,181 --> 00:17:25,912
I think he needs to make
things right with me.

427
00:17:25,935 --> 00:17:28,269
It doesn't matter
who takes the first step.

428
00:17:28,501 --> 00:17:30,375
Jake, he loves you,

429
00:17:30,555 --> 00:17:33,055
and that's not something
you can just throw away.

430
00:17:33,736 --> 00:17:36,327
But you're more important
to me than he is.

431
00:17:37,274 --> 00:17:38,686
Thank you.

432
00:17:39,476 --> 00:17:42,478
But family is the most
important thing in the world.

433
00:17:42,525 --> 00:17:45,526
That's why I make sure
my kids get to see their dad,

434
00:17:45,546 --> 00:17:47,232
even if he is
behind Plexiglas,

435
00:17:47,252 --> 00:17:49,603
wearing an orange jumpsuit.

436
00:17:51,162 --> 00:17:52,933
I can't believe
I'm not going to be there

437
00:17:52,949 --> 00:17:54,881
to see my only son get married.

438
00:17:55,034 --> 00:17:56,794
Well, if it makes
you feel any better,

439
00:17:56,817 --> 00:17:59,318
I'm pretty sure you'll have
many more opportunities.

440
00:18:00,497 --> 00:18:02,498
I got married in Vegas,

441
00:18:02,518 --> 00:18:04,701
and divorced in Reno.

442
00:18:05,123 --> 00:18:07,304
Hell of a weekend.

443
00:18:08,930 --> 00:18:10,881
Dad, I got to talk to you.

444
00:18:10,883 --> 00:18:12,867
Yeah, yeah, I-I need
to talk to you, too.

445
00:18:12,869 --> 00:18:16,971
Um, I want to tell you
both that I'm sorry,

446
00:18:17,033 --> 00:18:18,746
um, that...

447
00:18:19,138 --> 00:18:22,803
if marrying Tammy is the
right thing for you...

448
00:18:23,261 --> 00:18:25,278
you have my love
and support.

449
00:18:25,557 --> 00:18:26,673
We're not getting married.

450
00:18:26,691 --> 00:18:28,335
Oh, thank God!

451
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:31,166
Jake...

452
00:18:31,206 --> 00:18:32,519
I'm also sorry.

453
00:18:32,535 --> 00:18:33,959
You're dead to me.

454
00:18:34,205 --> 00:18:36,797
And your room's a home theater.

455
00:18:37,398 --> 00:18:39,357
W-What made you
change your mind?

456
00:18:39,383 --> 00:18:41,600
I just decided that I don't want
to get married

457
00:18:41,633 --> 00:18:44,801
unless you're going to be the
one to walk me down the aisle.

458
00:18:45,767 --> 00:18:47,802
A-Actually the dad
walks the, uh...

459
00:18:47,804 --> 00:18:49,929
Let it go.
Right.

460
00:18:50,236 --> 00:18:52,339
I just— I want
you to be happy.

461
00:18:52,365 --> 00:18:55,164
Thanks, and, you know, someday
we are going to get married,

462
00:18:55,213 --> 00:18:57,500
maybe get a dog or a leopard,

463
00:18:57,534 --> 00:18:59,697
have a couple kids of our own—

464
00:18:59,732 --> 00:19:03,033
maybe more than a couple,
maybe, like, two or three.

465
00:19:12,010 --> 00:19:14,595
You're going to need
a bigger house.

466
00:19:20,971 --> 00:19:24,089
You know, this place
could really use a home gym.

467
00:19:24,856 --> 00:19:27,371
That's a good idea.

468
00:19:27,417 --> 00:19:29,984
Where could we put it?

469
00:19:31,363 --> 00:19:32,962
I've been, uh,
thinking about names

470
00:19:33,016 --> 00:19:35,016
for when Tammy and I have
our first kid.

471
00:19:36,185 --> 00:19:38,134
You're enjoying
this, aren't you?

472
00:19:38,182 --> 00:19:39,432
Yep.

473
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:41,457
Although I-I am a little worried

474
00:19:41,482 --> 00:19:44,354
about a third generation
of freeloaders living here.

475
00:19:45,735 --> 00:19:48,171
If it's a boy, what do you think
about Walden Harper?

476
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:50,181
I like it.
No.

477
00:19:50,208 --> 00:19:51,966
All right, then, I guess
it's down to either

478
00:19:52,046 --> 00:19:54,446
Alan or Xiang Xao.

479
00:19:55,448 --> 00:19:57,229
Xiang Xao?

480
00:19:57,271 --> 00:19:59,087
Yeah, I got to be ready, Dad.

481
00:19:59,130 --> 00:20:02,701
They say one out of every three
babies born is Chinese.

482
00:20:06,194 --> 00:20:07,782
I love it.
