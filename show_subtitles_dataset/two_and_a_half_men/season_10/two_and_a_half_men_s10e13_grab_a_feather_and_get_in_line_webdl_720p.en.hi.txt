Previously on
Two and a Half Men...

2
00:00:02,954 --> 00:00:04,545
I am determined
to find someone

3
00:00:04,550 --> 00:00:05,600
who wants
to be with me

4
00:00:05,627 --> 00:00:07,806
for who I am,
not what I have.

5
00:00:07,832 --> 00:00:09,606
You can be whoever you want to be.
Hmm.

6
00:00:09,707 --> 00:00:11,136
I can help you out with that.

7
00:00:11,166 --> 00:00:12,165
Sam Wilson.

8
00:00:12,176 --> 00:00:13,898
Maybe you could crash here.

9
00:00:13,915 --> 00:00:16,923
I think it is great that you're
working on your computer stuff,

10
00:00:16,962 --> 00:00:19,146
but we need help now.

11
00:00:19,187 --> 00:00:21,265
I get it.
Say no more.

12
00:00:21,541 --> 00:00:23,457
I'll start looking
for a job.

13
00:00:23,493 --> 00:00:25,238
Your job's just a way to get by

14
00:00:25,274 --> 00:00:27,346
till you get your big break
as a designer.

15
00:00:27,371 --> 00:00:28,664
What if it
never happens?

16
00:00:28,693 --> 00:00:30,932
I want to invest in
your line of clothing.

17
00:00:30,948 --> 00:00:31,814
Really?

18
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:33,520
Pack your bags
for New York,

19
00:00:33,549 --> 00:00:35,459
because I am gonna
write you a check

20
00:00:35,495 --> 00:00:37,244
for $50,000.

21
00:00:38,037 --> 00:00:39,491
The stress
of living a lie

22
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:41,465
is causing you
to just fall apart.

23
00:00:41,483 --> 00:00:42,731
You're binge-eating.

24
00:00:42,754 --> 00:00:43,659
I'll miss you.

25
00:00:43,675 --> 00:00:44,624
I love you, Sam.

26
00:00:44,647 --> 00:00:46,614
Hello? Walden?

27
00:00:46,633 --> 00:00:47,799
Why is it so dark in here?

28
00:00:47,837 --> 00:00:49,370
Alan, no!

29
00:00:53,748 --> 00:00:54,800
Walden.

30
00:00:54,842 --> 00:00:56,300
What's happened
to you?

31
00:00:56,317 --> 00:00:57,928
What do you mean?

32
00:00:57,953 --> 00:00:59,055
Uh... okay.

33
00:00:59,074 --> 00:01:01,425
I-I don't know how
to say this, um...

34
00:01:01,441 --> 00:01:03,999
but you're either
wearing a child's shirt

35
00:01:04,034 --> 00:01:06,091
or carrying a child.

36
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:09,473
Both options raise concerns.

37
00:01:10,731 --> 00:01:12,835
Hey, I will not apologize

38
00:01:12,854 --> 00:01:15,398
for enjoying the art
of fine cuisine.

39
00:01:15,612 --> 00:01:19,280
Says the guy who has barbecue
sauce all over his back.

40
00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:23,620
Oh, like I'm the first guy
to fall asleep on a McRib.

41
00:01:24,492 --> 00:01:26,092
What are you doing here, Alan?

42
00:01:26,113 --> 00:01:27,315
I'm worried
about you.

43
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:28,771
I haven't seen you
in three weeks.

44
00:01:28,793 --> 00:01:29,842
Kate's still
in New York.

45
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:31,772
Why are you still
in her apartment?

46
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:33,437
I like it here.

47
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:34,529
It's comfortable.

48
00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:36,115
Besides, the beach house
smells like you.

49
00:01:36,132 --> 00:01:37,632
This place smells like Kate.

50
00:01:37,652 --> 00:01:41,254
I'll take "things a serial
killer would say" for $200.

51
00:01:41,302 --> 00:01:43,456
You want to be my next victim?

52
00:01:43,645 --> 00:01:45,981
Come on, Walden, look at you.

53
00:01:46,002 --> 00:01:48,058
You're-you're
a disgusting blob.

54
00:01:48,093 --> 00:01:50,557
I mean, can you even see
your penis past that gut?

55
00:01:50,587 --> 00:01:52,718
My penis is like Santa Claus.

56
00:01:52,755 --> 00:01:55,098
I don't need to see it;
I just need to believe in it.

57
00:01:55,316 --> 00:01:56,827
Well, you know what I believe?

58
00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:58,280
Living a double life
is killing you.

59
00:01:58,306 --> 00:01:59,862
Well, you don't know
what you're talking about.

60
00:01:59,891 --> 00:02:01,938
So why don't you just go away?

61
00:02:02,346 --> 00:02:04,013
So, you don't think
you need any help?

62
00:02:04,032 --> 00:02:05,557
I know I don't need any help.

63
00:02:05,579 --> 00:02:07,057
Fine, then I'll leave.

64
00:02:10,378 --> 00:02:11,460
Alan?

65
00:02:13,857 --> 00:02:14,774
Yeah?

66
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:16,652
I need help.

67
00:02:17,803 --> 00:02:19,853
Oh, buddy, it's-it's
gonna be okay.

68
00:02:19,874 --> 00:02:21,991
No, it's not gonna be okay!

69
00:02:22,025 --> 00:02:23,563
I'm out of control!

70
00:02:23,585 --> 00:02:25,919
I'm lying to the woman I love!

71
00:02:25,953 --> 00:02:27,520
And the only thing
I do more than lie

72
00:02:27,553 --> 00:02:29,561
is eat raw cookie dough.

73
00:02:29,786 --> 00:02:32,520
And I think I have salmonella.

74
00:02:33,468 --> 00:02:34,764
Don't worry.

75
00:02:34,991 --> 00:02:36,792
Alan's here now.

76
00:02:36,808 --> 00:02:38,411
We're gonna get you...

77
00:02:38,431 --> 00:02:40,341
hosed down and...

78
00:02:41,039 --> 00:02:42,044
back in shape

79
00:02:42,055 --> 00:02:44,194
and-and feeling like
your old self again.

80
00:02:44,244 --> 00:02:45,216
You think so?

81
00:02:45,236 --> 00:02:46,360
Oh, absolutely.

82
00:02:46,385 --> 00:02:47,701
And after we do,

83
00:02:47,723 --> 00:02:49,656
you're gonna call up Kate
and tell her the truth.

84
00:02:49,675 --> 00:02:51,116
What? No, I can't.

85
00:02:51,131 --> 00:02:52,714
You have to.
Why?

86
00:02:52,744 --> 00:02:55,326
Because the truth will
set you free, and you know it.

87
00:02:55,373 --> 00:02:56,790
Okay.

88
00:02:56,844 --> 00:02:58,097
Maybe you're right.

89
00:02:58,118 --> 00:02:59,734
There you go.

90
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:03,802
Plus, it'd be nice to lose
the gut and see my penis again.

91
00:03:04,031 --> 00:03:06,528
And I'm sure he'd like
to see you, too.

Are you sure you're not
Skyping from heaven?

surrounded by half-naked angels.

Oh, yeah,
that's Britté and Inga.

I'll be there
tomorrow.

114
00:04:18,605 --> 00:04:20,566
You do realize they'll be
dressed by then.

115
00:04:21,206 --> 00:04:23,754
No, I'm coming to see you.

116
00:04:23,802 --> 00:04:25,668
But if the models
are still there

117
00:04:25,685 --> 00:04:27,178
and we wind up getting
in a pillow fight

then so be it.

Yay.

127
00:04:45,957 --> 00:04:47,540
Don't worry about him.

128
00:04:47,709 --> 00:04:48,995
I'll see you tomorrow, okay?

129
00:04:49,009 --> 00:04:50,303
Oh, and do me a favor.

130
00:04:50,328 --> 00:04:52,613
Before I get there, make sure
those models have clothes on.

131
00:04:53,352 --> 00:04:56,502
How do you feel about
naughty school girl outfits?

132
00:04:56,801 --> 00:04:59,302
I find them degrading.

133
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:00,804

I love you.

00:05:06,886 --> 00:05:08,637
So did you tell her?

00:05:08,838 --> 00:05:09,707
No.

137
00:05:09,838 --> 00:05:11,738
I want to tell her in person.

138
00:05:12,009 --> 00:05:13,592
So pack
your bags.

00:05:20,504 --> 00:05:21,661
Well, you got it.

144
00:05:21,687 --> 00:05:23,354
Thank you.
Uh, uh, Walden?

145
00:05:23,393 --> 00:05:24,892
Yes, I'll cover your expenses.

00:05:24,934 --> 00:05:26,656
Great. Um, and...

147
00:05:26,698 --> 00:05:28,948
Yes, I'll give you
per diem.

148
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:32,784

I'm screwed.

Ooh, you know what we
should do in New York?

151
00:05:40,378 --> 00:05:42,069

of this trip

166

is to tell the woman I love

167

One, Sam's better in bed.
What?

178
00:06:47,725 --> 00:06:49,200
He tries harder.

179
00:06:49,217 --> 00:06:50,968
He has to compensate

180
00:06:50,984 --> 00:06:52,403
for all the other things
he doesn't have.

181
00:06:52,421 --> 00:06:53,832
He's banging scared.

182
00:06:55,092 --> 00:06:57,734
If that's true, I'd be
the best lay on the planet.

183
00:06:59,217 --> 00:07:00,653
I just don't want to lose her.

184
00:07:00,709 --> 00:07:02,031
Oh, you won't.

185
00:07:04,219 --> 00:07:08,433
But it's fun to lose yourself
in the magic of Broadway.

186
00:07:09,396 --> 00:07:10,399
Alan.

187
00:07:10,442 --> 00:07:11,808
Fine.

188
00:07:12,706 --> 00:07:14,883
Well, it's too bad
you're in a relationship.

189
00:07:15,127 --> 00:07:18,768
Kate's show will be packed
with half-naked supermodels.

190
00:07:18,943 --> 00:07:20,451
S-Supermodels?

191
00:07:20,609 --> 00:07:21,273
Yeah.

192
00:07:21,290 --> 00:07:22,225
Wow.

193
00:07:23,158 --> 00:07:24,507
Excuse me
a second.

194
00:07:24,542 --> 00:07:26,492
I'm gonna
make a call.

195
00:07:26,828 --> 00:07:28,379
My girl.

196
00:07:30,470 --> 00:07:31,520
Hey, Lyndsey.

197
00:07:31,532 --> 00:07:32,911
Hey, what's up?

198
00:07:32,938 --> 00:07:35,077
I'm on Walden's Jet.

199
00:07:35,106 --> 00:07:37,679
- I'm flying to New York City.
- For what?

200
00:07:37,719 --> 00:07:39,969
A fashion show,
maybe take in a musical.

201
00:07:40,016 --> 00:07:42,038
Ah. Guys' weekend.

202
00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:44,247
Yes, exactly.

203
00:07:44,449 --> 00:07:46,434
Um, so anyhow,
I just wanted to...

204
00:07:46,465 --> 00:07:48,516
make sure you still love me.

205
00:07:48,546 --> 00:07:50,963
Of course I do.
Why would you even ask?

206
00:07:51,023 --> 00:07:52,518
Well, you know, I'm on a plane.

207
00:07:52,537 --> 00:07:54,973
You know, anything can happen
at any time.

208
00:07:55,148 --> 00:07:56,214
Don't worry, Alan.

209
00:07:56,244 --> 00:07:57,219
I love you.

210
00:07:57,250 --> 00:07:58,966
And we're gonna be
together forever.

211
00:07:59,191 --> 00:08:00,608
O-Okay, sweetie.

212
00:08:00,642 --> 00:08:02,615
I-I love you, too. Bye-bye.

213
00:08:04,151 --> 00:08:06,102
Son of a bitch.

214
00:08:10,121 --> 00:08:11,872
Oh, my. Oh, my.

215
00:08:12,221 --> 00:08:13,476
Oh... oh, gee.

216
00:08:13,514 --> 00:08:15,615
So... so tall. So...

217
00:08:15,661 --> 00:08:17,249
So very tall.

218
00:08:17,294 --> 00:08:19,667
Oh. Oh, that-that...
that's an 11.

219
00:08:20,195 --> 00:08:22,278
And... and now
we've got a... a 12.

220
00:08:22,517 --> 00:08:24,416
Oh, God, can you
believe this?

221
00:08:24,464 --> 00:08:26,869
All these beautiful women,
and I'm off the market.

222
00:08:26,914 --> 00:08:29,831
Yeah, 'cause that's what
models are looking for:

223
00:08:29,871 --> 00:08:32,215
a middle-aged, twice
divorced, broke-ass guy

224
00:08:32,252 --> 00:08:34,115
who lives in a guest room
with a dehumidifier

225
00:08:34,154 --> 00:08:35,737
and my old tax returns.

226
00:08:36,049 --> 00:08:38,747
Ooh, "I make enough money
to pay taxes."

227
00:08:38,796 --> 00:08:40,847
Rub my nose in it.

228
00:08:40,891 --> 00:08:42,023
I'm sorry.

229
00:08:42,055 --> 00:08:43,554
I'm just nervous.

230
00:08:43,569 --> 00:08:45,236
I don't know if
I can do this.

231
00:08:45,254 --> 00:08:46,487
I feel like
I'm gonna puke.

232
00:08:46,498 --> 00:08:47,851
Well, this is
the place for it.

233
00:08:47,869 --> 00:08:49,823
Grab a feather
and get in line.

234
00:08:49,868 --> 00:08:50,900
Sam!

235
00:08:51,092 --> 00:08:53,019
Hi, Kate.

236
00:08:53,053 --> 00:08:54,636
Hi.

237
00:08:55,501 --> 00:08:58,218
Alan, it's so good to...

238
00:08:58,786 --> 00:09:00,453
Alan!

239
00:09:00,485 --> 00:09:02,394
I'm very, very
happy for you.

240
00:09:02,413 --> 00:09:03,838
I hope this fashion show
brings you

241
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:05,610
all the success in the world.
Thank you.

242
00:09:05,641 --> 00:09:07,592
Why don't I leave
the two of you alone

243
00:09:07,611 --> 00:09:10,055
while I fill my head
with images to think of

244
00:09:10,089 --> 00:09:12,047
when I'm having sex
with the woman I love.

245
00:09:14,692 --> 00:09:16,526
I am so happy
you're here.

246
00:09:16,573 --> 00:09:18,438
Are you kidding? I wouldn't
miss it for the world.

247
00:09:18,462 --> 00:09:19,849
So, what's this big surprise

248
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:22,278
you had to fly all the way
to New York to talk to me about?

249
00:09:22,532 --> 00:09:24,420
Yeah... the surprise.

250
00:09:24,438 --> 00:09:26,054
That's...

251
00:09:26,087 --> 00:09:27,945
Okay, uh...

252
00:09:28,410 --> 00:09:29,607
close your eyes.

253
00:09:29,633 --> 00:09:31,006
All right.

254
00:09:31,732 --> 00:09:35,060
Kate, I'd like you to
meet Walden Schmidt.

255
00:09:39,167 --> 00:09:40,401
I don't understand.

256
00:09:40,442 --> 00:09:42,370
My name's not
Sam Wilson.

257
00:09:42,411 --> 00:09:44,211
It's Walden Schmidt.

258
00:09:45,070 --> 00:09:46,269
What?

259
00:09:46,418 --> 00:09:48,370
♪ Walk like a man

260
00:09:48,401 --> 00:09:50,298
♪ Talk like a man

261
00:09:50,344 --> 00:09:54,016
♪ Walk like a man, my son

262
00:09:54,265 --> 00:09:56,298
♪ No woman's worth ♪

263
00:10:00,782 --> 00:10:02,182
Wait a sec.

264
00:10:02,216 --> 00:10:04,587
Your name's not Sam Wilson?

265
00:10:04,763 --> 00:10:05,813
No.

266
00:10:06,339 --> 00:10:08,786
And I'm not broke, either.

267
00:10:09,494 --> 00:10:11,061
I have a lot of money.

268
00:10:11,157 --> 00:10:14,292
In fact, I have
more than a lot.

269
00:10:14,357 --> 00:10:16,471
Like, think about
a lot of money,

270
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:18,857
and then multiply
it by ten...

271
00:10:19,701 --> 00:10:21,229
thousand.

272
00:10:21,942 --> 00:10:23,709
But how is this possible?

273
00:10:23,772 --> 00:10:25,522
You worked at
a Christmas tree lot.

274
00:10:25,581 --> 00:10:27,097
You didn't chip in on the rent.

275
00:10:27,118 --> 00:10:30,069
I saw you use toilet paper
as a coffee filter.

276
00:10:30,118 --> 00:10:32,118
That's only because
the day before

277
00:10:32,148 --> 00:10:34,315
I used the last coffee
filter as toilet paper.

278
00:10:34,374 --> 00:10:35,539
Okay.

279
00:10:35,577 --> 00:10:38,144
Why are you
doing this, Sam?

280
00:10:38,192 --> 00:10:40,479
It's not Sam.
It's Walden.

281
00:10:40,569 --> 00:10:42,196
Okay, whatever your name is,

282
00:10:42,271 --> 00:10:45,012
why would you lie
about who you are?

283
00:10:45,082 --> 00:10:47,866
Because I wanted to meet
someone like you.

284
00:10:47,908 --> 00:10:49,251
Someone who's kind

285
00:10:49,268 --> 00:10:51,099
and genuine and sweet

286
00:10:51,147 --> 00:10:53,035
and not after my money.

287
00:10:53,085 --> 00:10:55,897
Someone that I felt like I had
a real connection with.

288
00:10:55,954 --> 00:10:58,788
So, to make sure
you could trust me,

289
00:10:58,835 --> 00:11:00,118
you lied to me?

290
00:11:00,154 --> 00:11:01,456
I'm really sorry.

291
00:11:01,507 --> 00:11:02,886
I-I got caught up in it,

292
00:11:02,964 --> 00:11:05,310
and then I-I couldn't figure out
how to get out, and it...

293
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:09,499
Trust me, you are the most
amazing person I've ever met.

294
00:11:09,690 --> 00:11:13,859
I love you whether I'm
Sam Wilson or Walden Schmidt.

295
00:11:13,938 --> 00:11:15,605
Well, good for you.

296
00:11:15,645 --> 00:11:19,481
Unfortunately, I have no idea
who Walden Schmidt is.

297
00:11:19,865 --> 00:11:21,761
Kate, wait.

298
00:11:21,801 --> 00:11:23,451
You know what?

299
00:11:23,515 --> 00:11:27,051
This whole time, I thought
he was the douche.

300
00:11:27,132 --> 00:11:30,217
Turns out you're
the douche.

301
00:11:34,190 --> 00:11:36,408
Unbelievable.

302
00:11:36,983 --> 00:11:39,099
She likes me.

303
00:11:44,812 --> 00:11:46,470
How you doing?

304
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:50,083
I've been better.

305
00:11:50,123 --> 00:11:52,256
Aw, I'm sorry, buddy.

306
00:11:52,335 --> 00:11:54,891
You know what might
cheer you up?

307
00:11:55,141 --> 00:11:56,391
There are still tickets

308
00:11:56,488 --> 00:11:59,055
for tonight's performance
of Jersey Boys.

309
00:11:59,094 --> 00:12:01,280
We're not going to Jersey Boys.

310
00:12:01,343 --> 00:12:03,026
Oh, I totally get it.

311
00:12:03,104 --> 00:12:04,637
Lion King it is.

312
00:12:04,715 --> 00:12:07,299
We're not going
to any musical at all.

313
00:12:07,359 --> 00:12:08,775
Fine.

314
00:12:09,564 --> 00:12:12,923
I just don't understand why
we both have to be depressed.

315
00:12:13,284 --> 00:12:16,252
I don't think she's
ever going to forgive me.

316
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:17,684
Why would she?

317
00:12:17,743 --> 00:12:20,827
I mean, I lied to her
about everything.

318
00:12:20,857 --> 00:12:23,391
I don't want to give
anything away

319
00:12:23,444 --> 00:12:26,851
in case you change
your mind and we do go, but...

320
00:12:26,947 --> 00:12:29,531
when Simba lies to his friends

321
00:12:30,253 --> 00:12:33,106
by not telling them
that he's the Lion King,

322
00:12:33,294 --> 00:12:34,627
they forgive him

323
00:12:34,708 --> 00:12:37,842
after a few short but snappy
dance numbers.

324
00:12:37,874 --> 00:12:41,242
Life is not a musical, Alan.

325
00:12:41,974 --> 00:12:43,573
So knock it off.

326
00:12:43,656 --> 00:12:45,484
See, that wouldn't
have hurt so much

327
00:12:45,526 --> 00:12:47,192
if you'd sung it.

328
00:12:47,991 --> 00:12:50,794
I'm sorry, I'm-I'm just upset.

329
00:12:51,505 --> 00:12:54,430
I mean, I did
what I did for love.

330
00:12:56,179 --> 00:12:58,095

Walden?

Uh, your phone's ringing.

414
00:16:17,031 --> 00:16:18,308
What...?

415
00:16:18,767 --> 00:16:20,010
Oh.

416
00:16:21,987 --> 00:16:23,460
It's Kate.

417
00:16:24,842 --> 00:16:26,355
Hey, Kate.

418
00:16:27,138 --> 00:16:28,889
Yeah, I can meet.

419
00:16:29,095 --> 00:16:30,995
Yeah, I'll be right there.

420
00:16:31,092 --> 00:16:32,347
Okay.

421
00:16:33,223 --> 00:16:34,840
She wants to see me.

422
00:16:34,868 --> 00:16:36,439
Here, take care
of the check for me.

423
00:16:36,453 --> 00:16:37,915
Will do.

424
00:16:52,269 --> 00:16:53,660
Douche.

425
00:16:58,831 --> 00:16:59,874
Hey.

426
00:17:00,997 --> 00:17:02,193
Hey.

427
00:17:02,307 --> 00:17:03,988
How'd the show go?

428
00:17:04,025 --> 00:17:05,858
It was pretty amazing, actually.

429
00:17:05,887 --> 00:17:09,555
The buyer from Neiman Marcus
is interested in my stuff.

430
00:17:09,943 --> 00:17:11,388
That's great.

431
00:17:11,422 --> 00:17:12,854
About halfway through the show,

432
00:17:12,867 --> 00:17:14,552
I realized that...

433
00:17:14,613 --> 00:17:17,981
Alan probably didn't pay
for this, did he?

434
00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:19,329
No.

435
00:17:20,262 --> 00:17:22,446
But if the models ask,
throw him a bone.

436
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:25,408
Thank you.

437
00:17:25,801 --> 00:17:27,883
I'm really sorry.

438
00:17:29,071 --> 00:17:31,389
Do you think that there's
a way that we can...

439
00:17:31,444 --> 00:17:32,723
make this work?

440
00:17:32,754 --> 00:17:34,439
I don't know.

441
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:36,810
I mean, I trusted you, and...

442
00:17:36,841 --> 00:17:38,682
you didn't trust me.

443
00:17:39,876 --> 00:17:42,378
Now I don't even
know who you are.

444
00:17:42,418 --> 00:17:45,383
Well, if you think about it,
I'm really the same guy.

445
00:17:45,407 --> 00:17:47,424
I just have a better watch.

446
00:17:47,532 --> 00:17:49,373
And a better car.

447
00:17:49,464 --> 00:17:50,700
A better house.

448
00:17:50,775 --> 00:17:51,938
A better...

449
00:17:52,725 --> 00:17:53,811
jet.

450
00:17:56,138 --> 00:17:58,168
So nothing about you is real.

451
00:17:58,247 --> 00:18:00,724
What's real is that I love you.

452
00:18:01,676 --> 00:18:04,183
Okay, well...

453
00:18:04,823 --> 00:18:08,252
I'm gonna need some time
to process all of this.

454
00:18:14,883 --> 00:18:17,769
So, you think...

455
00:18:17,799 --> 00:18:19,498
maybe when we
get back to L.A...

456
00:18:19,516 --> 00:18:20,830
I'm not going back to L.A.

457
00:18:20,849 --> 00:18:21,849
What?

458
00:18:21,869 --> 00:18:23,883
Yeah, thanks to you, I...

459
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:25,735
might have a life here now.

460
00:18:26,172 --> 00:18:27,358
Wow.

461
00:18:27,776 --> 00:18:30,444
I didn't think any
of this through, did I?

462
00:18:31,430 --> 00:18:33,646
Apparently not, Walden Smith.

463
00:18:33,769 --> 00:18:36,082
It's actually Schmidt.

464
00:18:36,408 --> 00:18:38,647
You know, it's not important.

465
00:18:39,483 --> 00:18:42,685
So I guess I'll just wait
to hear from you.

466
00:18:42,848 --> 00:18:44,448
I guess so.

467
00:18:46,210 --> 00:18:47,984
Good-bye, Sam.

468
00:18:53,232 --> 00:18:54,683
It's Walden.

469
00:18:55,150 --> 00:18:55,785
Hey.

470
00:18:55,824 --> 00:18:57,851
Look who needs
a ride back to L.A.

471
00:18:57,892 --> 00:19:00,877
Ja, Alan the billionaire's
got a big jet.

472
00:19:02,649 --> 00:19:05,018
It slipped out while they
were running away from me.

473
00:19:11,061 --> 00:19:13,064
Ooh, too much champagne!

474
00:19:15,184 --> 00:19:17,785
They are... awfully pretty.

475
00:19:18,121 --> 00:19:19,446
Yeah.

476
00:19:19,884 --> 00:19:21,900
You, uh... you gonna?

477
00:19:24,369 --> 00:19:26,367
Nah, I'm not interested.

478
00:19:26,390 --> 00:19:27,590
Oh, me, neither.

479
00:19:27,609 --> 00:19:29,521
You know, I have a girlfriend.

480
00:19:30,184 --> 00:19:31,918
But, you know,
if we could, uh,

481
00:19:31,936 --> 00:19:34,187
which, uh... which one
would you choose?

482
00:19:37,882 --> 00:19:39,049
Probably the brunette.

483
00:19:39,078 --> 00:19:41,091
Really? The brunette?

484
00:19:42,194 --> 00:19:43,660
Oh, you want the brunette?

485
00:19:43,682 --> 00:19:45,156
Oh, me? No, I...

486
00:19:45,181 --> 00:19:47,848
I said, you know...
the aforementioned girlfriend.

487
00:19:50,092 --> 00:19:52,393
Although Lyndsey is a blonde,

488
00:19:52,447 --> 00:19:55,931
and the brunette would make
a very nice palate cleanser.

489
00:19:57,134 --> 00:19:59,368
You know, uh, uh...
hypothetically.

490
00:20:00,029 --> 00:20:00,753
Fine.

491
00:20:00,775 --> 00:20:02,157
You can have the brunette.

492
00:20:02,178 --> 00:20:03,244
Hypothetically.

493
00:20:03,259 --> 00:20:04,809
If we're talking hypothetically,

494
00:20:04,824 --> 00:20:07,505
it's my plane, you're not here,
and I'm taking them both.

495
00:20:09,103 --> 00:20:10,748
Right. Are we
done with this?

496
00:20:10,773 --> 00:20:12,378
Hypothetically.

497
00:20:13,896 --> 00:20:15,530
So, uh, I assume you're

498
00:20:15,556 --> 00:20:17,073
moving back into
the beach house.

499
00:20:17,096 --> 00:20:18,546
- Yeah.
- Good. Good.

500
00:20:18,567 --> 00:20:19,905
The place felt
empty without you.

501
00:20:19,923 --> 00:20:21,147
Oh, please.

502
00:20:21,154 --> 00:20:22,391
You loved every minute of it.

503
00:20:22,406 --> 00:20:24,206
I did. I really did.

504
00:20:24,332 --> 00:20:27,359
I got to tell you,
your bed ruined me.

505
00:20:27,395 --> 00:20:29,779
And I ruined it.

506
00:20:30,052 --> 00:20:31,325
Ugh.

507
00:20:31,367 --> 00:20:34,001
I'm sorry, buddy.
You were gone a long time.

508
00:20:35,459 --> 00:20:36,656
I'm just gonna miss

509
00:20:36,678 --> 00:20:39,378
waking up next to Kate
every morning. Mmm...

510
00:20:39,417 --> 00:20:42,954
I'm gonna miss driving
your fancy sports car.

511
00:20:42,991 --> 00:20:45,325
I'm gonna miss
the way she held my hand

512
00:20:45,354 --> 00:20:47,020
when we watched a movie.

513
00:20:47,204 --> 00:20:48,501
I'm gonna miss the way

514
00:20:48,523 --> 00:20:50,939
your underwear felt
fresh from the dryer.

515
00:20:53,509 --> 00:20:54,948
I'm taking the brunette.
