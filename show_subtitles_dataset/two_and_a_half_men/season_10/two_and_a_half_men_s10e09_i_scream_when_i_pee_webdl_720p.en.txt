1
00:00:01,272 --> 00:00:02,972
Previously on
Two and a Half Men...

2
00:00:02,983 --> 00:00:04,481
I'm talking about making

3
00:00:04,491 --> 00:00:06,123
a long-term commitment
to each other.

4
00:00:06,142 --> 00:00:07,308
You mean like marriage?

5
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:08,771
I just don't understand
why we can't

6
00:00:08,776 --> 00:00:09,939
keep things the way they are.

7
00:00:09,955 --> 00:00:11,445
You mean living day-to-day,

8
00:00:11,458 --> 00:00:13,485
never knowing what kind of future
you have with the person

9
00:00:13,511 --> 00:00:15,834
you've been in a relationship with
the past three years?

10
00:00:15,863 --> 00:00:18,999
Okay, I-I prefer to think of it
as cherishing each day—

11
00:00:19,033 --> 00:00:21,966
nay, each moment—
with the woman I love

12
00:00:21,995 --> 00:00:24,327
because it-it could
all disappear

13
00:00:24,345 --> 00:00:25,821
in-in the blink of an eye.

14
00:00:25,843 --> 00:00:27,901
You mean like this?

15
00:00:27,924 --> 00:00:29,121
How was your day?

16
00:00:29,149 --> 00:00:30,838
I'm pretty sure
Lyndsey and I broke up.

17
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:32,704
I really like Lyndsey.
I thought she was great.

18
00:00:32,716 --> 00:00:33,636
She is great.

19
00:00:33,648 --> 00:00:35,250
But I'm not gonna be bullied
into spending the rest

20
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:37,137
of my life with somebody
just 'cause they're great.

21
00:00:38,497 --> 00:00:40,440
- Alan.
- We need to talk.

22
00:00:40,453 --> 00:00:41,285
Go ahead.

23
00:00:41,297 --> 00:00:43,376
I-I want to be with you forever.

24
00:00:43,773 --> 00:00:46,004
That's all I ever
wanted to hear.

25
00:00:46,022 --> 00:00:47,289
I love you, Lyndsey,

26
00:00:47,308 --> 00:00:50,192
and as soon as I can
save enough money,

27
00:00:50,215 --> 00:00:51,669
I'm gonna...

28
00:00:51,693 --> 00:00:54,441
put a deposit down
on an engagement ring.

29
00:00:54,473 --> 00:00:56,899
You don't have to
buy me some dumb ring.

30
00:00:56,932 --> 00:00:59,443
That's all I ever
wanted to hear.

31
00:01:04,052 --> 00:01:05,635
Oh! Oh, hey, Jake.

32
00:01:05,651 --> 00:01:07,711
- Hey, Dad.
- What's going on?

33
00:01:07,734 --> 00:01:09,663
Oh, I've got good news.
I've got a girlfriend.

34
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,240
Oh, oh, that's great.

35
00:01:11,258 --> 00:01:12,374
And it gets better.

36
00:01:12,388 --> 00:01:14,333
She gave me the clap.

37
00:01:15,341 --> 00:01:17,253
Wait, wait, how's that better?

38
00:01:17,277 --> 00:01:20,346
It's a sexually transmitted
disease, Dad.

39
00:01:22,194 --> 00:01:24,934
Sexually transmitted.

40
00:01:25,137 --> 00:01:27,199
Disease.

41
00:01:27,786 --> 00:01:29,717
Yeah. So you get it.

42
00:01:29,761 --> 00:01:32,467
And now everybody knows
that I'm getting it.

43
00:01:32,493 --> 00:01:35,191
Wait.
Wait, y-you're telling people?

44
00:01:35,226 --> 00:01:38,542
No, I don't have to,
'cause I scream when I pee.

45
00:01:39,690 --> 00:01:42,224
I'm literally speechless, Jake.

46
00:01:42,995 --> 00:01:44,442
Hey, Walden!

47
00:01:44,458 --> 00:01:45,947
Oh, hey, Jake.

48
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:47,839
I got the clap!

49
00:01:50,249 --> 00:01:53,756
Uh... congratulations.

50
00:01:54,089 --> 00:01:55,821
Thanks, man.

51
00:01:55,823 --> 00:01:57,642
All right, gotta run, Dad.
I'll talk to you later.

52
00:01:57,664 --> 00:02:00,850
I'm going to SeaWorld with my
girlfriend and her three kids.

53
00:02:02,028 --> 00:02:05,160
It's too bad antibiotics
can't cure stupidity.

54
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:07,302
Hey, that's my son you're...

55
00:02:07,343 --> 00:02:09,413
eh, you're right.

56
00:02:11,738 --> 00:02:12,837
Huh.

57
00:02:12,843 --> 00:02:13,809
What?

58
00:02:13,821 --> 00:02:16,472
I just got an e-mail
from my ex-wife.

59
00:02:16,504 --> 00:02:18,397
She wants to meet me for coffee.

60
00:02:18,417 --> 00:02:19,383
Judith?

61
00:02:19,393 --> 00:02:21,225
Oh, no, no, m-my second wife.

62
00:02:21,231 --> 00:02:23,765
You got two women to marry you?

63
00:02:24,191 --> 00:02:24,878
Yeah.

64
00:02:24,902 --> 00:02:27,787
I had to get the taste
of Judith out of my mouth.

65
00:02:28,733 --> 00:02:30,865
How come you never told me
about the second one?

66
00:02:30,885 --> 00:02:32,209
Ah, there wasn't much to tell.

67
00:02:32,222 --> 00:02:33,672
I mean, we got married in Vegas,

68
00:02:33,693 --> 00:02:35,628
won a half a million
dollar jackpot,

69
00:02:35,642 --> 00:02:37,051
she dumped me, took the money,

70
00:02:37,074 --> 00:02:39,213
and moved to New York
and became a TV star.

71
00:02:39,232 --> 00:02:41,456
This might be the first
interesting story

72
00:02:41,488 --> 00:02:43,552
you've ever told.

73
00:02:43,836 --> 00:02:45,327
Was she really a TV star?

74
00:02:45,347 --> 00:02:48,011
Yeah, she's on that
cop show Stiffs.

75
00:02:48,242 --> 00:02:50,261
"If you're not
one of the suspects,

76
00:02:50,287 --> 00:02:52,231
you're one of the Stiffs."

77
00:02:52,497 --> 00:02:54,467
I love that show.

78
00:02:54,496 --> 00:02:56,029
Who does she play?

79
00:02:56,041 --> 00:02:58,022
Detective Jane Risotto.

80
00:02:58,842 --> 00:03:00,699
Wait a minute!

81
00:03:00,935 --> 00:03:03,396
You were married to
tough-talkin', smooth-walkin',

82
00:03:03,428 --> 00:03:05,576
pistol-packin' Jane Risotto?

83
00:03:05,744 --> 00:03:06,934
Guilty.

84
00:03:06,947 --> 00:03:09,399
Guilty of being with
the hottest woman on Earth.

85
00:03:09,423 --> 00:03:10,188
I-I know.

86
00:03:10,199 --> 00:03:11,425
Hold on...

87
00:03:11,436 --> 00:03:12,377
Wait, her?

88
00:03:12,393 --> 00:03:13,526
Yes.

89
00:03:14,604 --> 00:03:15,713
You?

90
00:03:16,576 --> 00:03:17,861
Yes.

91
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:19,525
No...

92
00:03:19,906 --> 00:03:21,660
- Yes.
- No!

93
00:03:21,828 --> 00:03:24,666
And you wonder why I didn't
tell you about this.

94
00:03:26,184 --> 00:03:27,485
No!

95
00:03:27,665 --> 00:03:28,964
Yes!

96
00:03:30,722 --> 00:03:33,291
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

97
00:04:05,353 --> 00:04:06,987
Kandi, over here.

98
00:04:07,014 --> 00:04:08,770
Alan.

99
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:11,231
Look at you.
You look terrific.

100
00:04:11,262 --> 00:04:12,262
Oh, thank you.

101
00:04:12,272 --> 00:04:13,753
And you look...
Wow.

102
00:04:15,131 --> 00:04:17,130
That-that dress fits you
like a...

103
00:04:17,158 --> 00:04:19,150
spray-on tan.

104
00:04:20,053 --> 00:04:21,988
It's so good to see you.

105
00:04:22,008 --> 00:04:24,442
Well, you, too. So, uh,
what are you doing here?

106
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:27,247
Meeting you for coffee. Duh.

107
00:04:27,616 --> 00:04:30,547
Uh, n-no, I meant what are
you doing here in L.A.?

108
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:33,246
Oh. I'm in the new
James Cameron movie.

109
00:04:33,275 --> 00:04:35,037
- Oh!
- I'm gonna be in 3-D.

110
00:04:35,061 --> 00:04:37,671
You'll certainly pop
right off the screen.

111
00:04:38,162 --> 00:04:40,097
Pop, pop.

112
00:04:40,436 --> 00:04:41,602
Thanks.

113
00:04:41,621 --> 00:04:43,527
So, what's up with you?
How's Jake?

114
00:04:43,541 --> 00:04:45,829
Oh, good. Uh, he's in the army.

115
00:04:45,963 --> 00:04:48,297
Wow!
Yeah.

116
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:50,030
Which one?

117
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:52,912
Um... ours.

118
00:04:52,951 --> 00:04:55,081
Oh, phew.

119
00:04:55,277 --> 00:04:57,481
So, look at you,
Little Miss Hollywood.

120
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:00,301
Oh, please,
I haven't changed at all.

121
00:05:00,315 --> 00:05:03,964
I'd like a nonfat, decaf latte
with just a whisper of foam.

122
00:05:04,026 --> 00:05:06,984
Um, Kandi, he doesn't work here.

123
00:05:08,044 --> 00:05:09,581
Is that a problem?

124
00:05:09,594 --> 00:05:10,659
Nope.

125
00:05:13,584 --> 00:05:16,519
So, did you ever get remarried?

126
00:05:16,547 --> 00:05:19,906
Oh, oh, no, but, uh... but I do
have a lovely girlfriend.

127
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:22,570
Oh... good for you.

128
00:05:22,615 --> 00:05:25,582
Thanks. So, how about you?
You seeing anyone?

129
00:05:25,612 --> 00:05:29,922
No. Most guys just want a
piece of Detective Jane Risotto.

130
00:05:31,285 --> 00:05:34,193
Well, as pieces go,
that's a good one.

131
00:05:34,238 --> 00:05:35,404
Thanks.

132
00:05:35,437 --> 00:05:37,390
I never told you this,

133
00:05:37,425 --> 00:05:39,792
but you're the best lover
I ever had.

134
00:05:39,952 --> 00:05:42,995
Oh, oh, geez, uh...
I don't know what to say.

135
00:05:43,031 --> 00:05:46,128
Uh, but, you know, I certainly
gave it 110% every time.

136
00:05:46,168 --> 00:05:47,300
Mmm.

137
00:05:47,302 --> 00:05:48,734
Wow.

138
00:05:48,768 --> 00:05:51,836
Imagine if you had given it
your all.

139
00:05:54,328 --> 00:05:56,873
I'm sorry,
you're in a relationship.

140
00:05:56,889 --> 00:05:58,672
We shouldn't even be talking
about this stuff.

141
00:05:58,693 --> 00:06:00,378
That's right.
It's just not appropriate.

142
00:06:00,416 --> 00:06:03,942
So, um... so, didn't you date
Derek Jeter for a while?

143
00:06:04,077 --> 00:06:05,495
I did.

144
00:06:05,715 --> 00:06:07,129
Huh.

145
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:15,967
Hi.

146
00:06:15,998 --> 00:06:17,948
Hi! What are you doing here?

147
00:06:17,972 --> 00:06:19,238
Well, something weird
just happened,

148
00:06:19,251 --> 00:06:21,151
and I wanted to talk
to you about it.

149
00:06:21,165 --> 00:06:22,016
You okay?

150
00:06:22,029 --> 00:06:23,395
Oh, oh, yeah, everything's fine.

151
00:06:23,416 --> 00:06:24,515
It's just, uh...

152
00:06:24,523 --> 00:06:27,191
Uh, well, come here,
sit down.

153
00:06:27,231 --> 00:06:28,646
What's going on?

154
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:30,885
Uh, well, okay,
here's the deal. I...

155
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:34,580
I just... met my ex-wife
for coffee and she...

156
00:06:34,642 --> 00:06:36,550
got a little flirtatious
with me,

157
00:06:36,574 --> 00:06:38,274
and it kind of freaked me out.

158
00:06:38,299 --> 00:06:40,558
Wait, Judith got
flirtatious with you?

159
00:06:40,584 --> 00:06:42,334
Oh, oh, no, it wasn't Judith.

160
00:06:42,359 --> 00:06:43,826
It was the hot one?

161
00:06:43,850 --> 00:06:47,514
Okay, I don't think Judith would
appreciate that, but, uh...

162
00:06:47,653 --> 00:06:50,166
but, yes, I-it was
the-the hot one.

163
00:06:50,189 --> 00:06:52,470
What do you mean
she was flirtatious?

164
00:06:52,492 --> 00:06:54,548
Oh, oh, the details
are unimportant.

165
00:06:54,561 --> 00:06:56,653
I mean, she said I was
better in bed than Derek Jeter,

166
00:06:56,663 --> 00:06:58,342
but whatever, um...

167
00:06:58,376 --> 00:07:00,242
Wait a second, you want me
to believe

168
00:07:00,262 --> 00:07:02,600
that one of the sexiest women
in the world hit on you

169
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:03,869
and you turned her down?

170
00:07:03,893 --> 00:07:05,108
Well, yes, yes, I-I did.

171
00:07:05,126 --> 00:07:07,794
I-I told Kandi that I am
in a committed relationship

172
00:07:07,814 --> 00:07:10,172
with a woman
that I-I truly love,

173
00:07:10,188 --> 00:07:11,921
and-and I just wanted
to tell you

174
00:07:11,937 --> 00:07:14,366
because I don't want us
to have any secrets.

175
00:07:14,607 --> 00:07:15,504
Really?

176
00:07:15,526 --> 00:07:19,081
Yeah. I don't need a young,
rich, gorgeous movie star

177
00:07:19,109 --> 00:07:20,863
with flawless skin
and a great body.

178
00:07:20,889 --> 00:07:22,487
I have you.

179
00:07:25,866 --> 00:07:28,431
Okay, l-let me try that again.

180
00:07:28,471 --> 00:07:30,098
Um...

181
00:07:34,657 --> 00:07:37,025
Oh, hey, you should take
tomorrow off.

182
00:07:37,098 --> 00:07:38,165
Why?

183
00:07:38,202 --> 00:07:39,229
It's your birthday.

184
00:07:39,236 --> 00:07:40,669
Nobody should have to work
on their birthday.

185
00:07:40,686 --> 00:07:42,753
Who the hell told you
it was my birthday?

186
00:07:42,777 --> 00:07:45,131
You did, when we put you
on my company health plan.

187
00:07:45,146 --> 00:07:48,313
Damn it, I should've just lived
with that hernia.

188
00:07:48,594 --> 00:07:51,165
Come on, birthdays are terrific.

189
00:07:51,205 --> 00:07:54,706
It's all your loved ones
celebrating how great you are.

190
00:07:54,738 --> 00:07:57,873
It's like Christmas, except
you're the savior of the world.

191
00:07:57,915 --> 00:07:59,581
Sounds good,

192
00:07:59,589 --> 00:08:02,924
but all my loved ones are
in jail, rehab, or dead.

193
00:08:02,948 --> 00:08:05,683
I can't think of anything
I'm less interested in

194
00:08:05,706 --> 00:08:07,172
than my birthday.

195
00:08:07,368 --> 00:08:09,134
Boy, do I have
a story for you.

196
00:08:09,153 --> 00:08:11,123
I stand corrected.

197
00:08:12,537 --> 00:08:13,504
What's going on?

198
00:08:13,522 --> 00:08:15,310
So, I go meet Kandi for coffee.

199
00:08:15,357 --> 00:08:18,092
Yeah.
It turns out she wants me.

200
00:08:18,128 --> 00:08:19,327
- No.
- Yeah.

201
00:08:19,349 --> 00:08:20,550
- No!
- Oh, yeah.

202
00:08:20,562 --> 00:08:21,361
So did you?

203
00:08:21,374 --> 00:08:22,299
- No.
- No?

204
00:08:22,312 --> 00:08:23,536
Yes!

205
00:08:23,696 --> 00:08:25,316
Uh, hold on, I'm lost.

206
00:08:25,385 --> 00:08:26,984
So, when I tell Lyndsey

207
00:08:27,017 --> 00:08:29,485
that I turned down
Kandi because of her,

208
00:08:29,521 --> 00:08:31,588
Lyndsey bangs my brains out.

209
00:08:31,618 --> 00:08:33,251
In the middle
of the day.

210
00:08:33,271 --> 00:08:35,585
She could see everything
and she kept going.

211
00:08:36,122 --> 00:08:36,978
No!

212
00:08:36,979 --> 00:08:39,213
Yes! But let's not get caught
in this loop again.

213
00:08:39,215 --> 00:08:40,414
I-I mean, all my life,

214
00:08:40,416 --> 00:08:42,441
I've had to lie to women
to have fantastic sex.

215
00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:44,765
Turns out, all I had
to do was be honest.

216
00:08:44,787 --> 00:08:46,888
It's almost ridiculous
in its simplicity.

217
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:49,862
From now on, I'm just gonna
be totally honest with women.

218
00:08:49,892 --> 00:08:51,781
Well, until they catch on
to that scam.

219
00:08:51,805 --> 00:08:55,039
Exactly. Then it's back
to Alan Harper, astronaut.

220
00:09:08,201 --> 00:09:09,867
Hello?

221
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,489
Kandi?

222
00:09:11,687 --> 00:09:14,053
Wait, wh-why are you crying?

223
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:16,380
Whoa, whoa, whoa, slow down.

224
00:09:18,034 --> 00:09:20,089
Okay, not that slow.

225
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:21,824
Wh...

226
00:09:21,945 --> 00:09:24,146
How many drinks have you had?

227
00:09:25,523 --> 00:09:28,462
All right, "schlebbin" is not
a real number,

228
00:09:29,095 --> 00:09:31,572
but it sounds like it was a lot.

229
00:09:32,074 --> 00:09:35,318
Oh, n-no, no,
d-don't talk like that.

230
00:09:35,726 --> 00:09:37,788
You've got plenty to live for.

231
00:09:38,076 --> 00:09:40,155
All right, all right,
d-don't do anything stupid.

232
00:09:40,179 --> 00:09:41,789
I-I'll be right over.

233
00:09:42,650 --> 00:09:45,218
This is the price I pay
for being the best lover ever.

234
00:09:52,064 --> 00:09:53,556
Where you going?

235
00:09:53,587 --> 00:09:57,209
Oh, I, uh, got to take care
of my drunk, hysterical ex-wife.

236
00:09:57,244 --> 00:09:59,063
What are you doing up?

237
00:09:59,105 --> 00:10:01,949
Checking the stock market
in London.

238
00:10:03,191 --> 00:10:05,571
You're watching porn,
aren't you?

239
00:10:06,131 --> 00:10:09,701
I have more than
one window open, yes.

240
00:10:10,297 --> 00:10:12,170
Okay, I'll see you.

241
00:10:12,204 --> 00:10:14,768
Wait, hey, you-you want
me to come with you?

242
00:10:14,813 --> 00:10:16,512
Oh, no, no, I think
I can handle it.

243
00:10:16,535 --> 00:10:18,579
You think you might get laid.

244
00:10:19,579 --> 00:10:22,179
I have more
than one window open, yes.

245
00:10:24,689 --> 00:10:29,593
== sync, corrected by elderman ==
Resync for WEB-DL by ryangiggsth

246
00:10:30,445 --> 00:10:32,520
It's open.

247
00:10:34,903 --> 00:10:36,237
Kandi?

248
00:10:36,328 --> 00:10:37,882
Hi.

249
00:10:38,714 --> 00:10:40,497
Are-are you okay?

250
00:10:40,529 --> 00:10:42,543
I am now that you're here.

251
00:10:42,577 --> 00:10:44,879
Wait a minute,
wh-what's going on?

252
00:10:44,906 --> 00:10:47,661
On the phone, you were drunk
and practically suicidal.

253
00:10:47,707 --> 00:10:49,689
I was acting.

254
00:10:51,418 --> 00:10:52,584
A-Acting?

255
00:10:52,602 --> 00:10:55,809
Alan, you don't get a People's
Choice Award for nothing.

256
00:10:56,657 --> 00:10:59,639
So this whole thing was a setup
just to get me over here?

257
00:10:59,670 --> 00:11:01,904
I'm used to getting what I want.

258
00:11:02,263 --> 00:11:04,416
Well, uh, yeah,
yeah, Kandi,

259
00:11:04,436 --> 00:11:06,336
but I told you before,
I-I have a girlfriend.

260
00:11:06,352 --> 00:11:08,963
And-and-and, oh, God,
you smell good.

261
00:11:08,995 --> 00:11:10,135
Kind of, kind of like

262
00:11:10,149 --> 00:11:12,695
a combination of
pineapple and...

263
00:11:12,901 --> 00:11:14,868
hope.

264
00:11:15,403 --> 00:11:17,512
I have a couple
of old friends here

265
00:11:17,548 --> 00:11:19,682
who want to say hello!

266
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:21,732
Hello.

267
00:11:22,007 --> 00:11:23,391
Hello.

268
00:11:24,608 --> 00:11:27,656
Why don't we continue this
conversation in the bedroom?

269
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:30,415
Oh. Oh, Kandi,
I... I-I can't.

270
00:11:30,451 --> 00:11:32,251
Um, I, I mean,
I mean, I can.

271
00:11:32,278 --> 00:11:36,592
Parts of me already did,
but, uh, I-I have to leave.

272
00:11:36,855 --> 00:11:38,789
All right, fine.

273
00:11:39,882 --> 00:11:42,034
You must really love her.

274
00:11:42,052 --> 00:11:44,920
That's the only explanation
I can come up with.

275
00:11:46,619 --> 00:11:49,922
Geez, the fact that you don't
want to sleep with me

276
00:11:49,956 --> 00:11:52,018
makes me want you even more.

277
00:11:52,052 --> 00:11:55,474
But if you did sleep with me,
you'd be like all the others,

278
00:11:55,494 --> 00:11:57,716
and then I wouldn't want
to sleep with you.

279
00:11:57,738 --> 00:12:00,404
So if you really don't want
to sleep with me,

280
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:02,928
you should sleep with me.

281
00:12:02,993 --> 00:12:06,433
The scary part is
that makes perfect sense.

282
00:12:06,852 --> 00:12:09,318
Um, good-bye, Kandi.

283
00:12:09,363 --> 00:12:12,074
Don't forget me, Alan.

284
00:12:12,926 --> 00:12:16,028
As long as there's a slow,
soapy shower in the world,

285
00:12:16,049 --> 00:12:18,315
you will never be forgotten.

286
00:12:24,076 --> 00:12:25,442
Good morning.

287
00:12:25,455 --> 00:12:27,714
Oh, hey, how'd it go
with Kandi last night?

288
00:12:27,735 --> 00:12:30,720
Horrible—
she wanted to have sex with me.

289
00:12:31,022 --> 00:12:34,753
Why do bad things happen
to good people?

290
00:12:34,864 --> 00:12:37,302
Bottom line is, I took
the high road, and it sucks.

291
00:12:37,339 --> 00:12:40,082
That's why it's
the road less traveled.

292
00:12:40,124 --> 00:12:41,723
Hey, let me ask you a question.

293
00:12:41,725 --> 00:12:43,889
Yes, they're spectacular.

294
00:12:44,206 --> 00:12:46,189
I knew it.

295
00:12:46,247 --> 00:12:49,720
what do you
usually do for Berta's birthday?

296
00:12:49,755 --> 00:12:52,280
Oh, uh, well, my brother
would stuff a card full of cash

297
00:12:52,309 --> 00:12:53,492
and then, after he passed out,

298
00:12:53,508 --> 00:12:56,534
I'd steam it open,
take a few 20s, and sign it.

299
00:12:58,771 --> 00:13:00,605
Yeah, I kind of get a feeling that

300
00:13:00,617 --> 00:13:02,949
She doesn't have anybody
doing anything special for her.

301
00:13:02,971 --> 00:13:05,638
Yeah, I don't think
she does.

302
00:13:05,654 --> 00:13:08,643
Let me know if you want to give
her cash; I'll buy the card.

303
00:13:11,821 --> 00:13:12,770
Oh.

304
00:13:12,804 --> 00:13:14,367
Hey, Lyndsey.

305
00:13:15,192 --> 00:13:17,392
Whoa, whoa, c-c-calm down.

306
00:13:18,531 --> 00:13:20,432
Kandi's hotel room?

307
00:13:20,465 --> 00:13:22,865
What, what makes you think
I was there?

308
00:13:24,171 --> 00:13:26,493
Paparazzi photos
on the Internet?

309
00:13:26,529 --> 00:13:30,060
Uh, wow, that, that is just,
that is crazy, Lyndsey.

310
00:13:30,077 --> 00:13:32,811
I, I, I don't know
what you're talking about.

311
00:13:32,872 --> 00:13:35,015
Hmm, maybe it's this.

312
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:36,676
Oh, crap.

313
00:13:36,709 --> 00:13:38,997
Um, uh, well, all right,
all right, all right,

314
00:13:39,010 --> 00:13:40,310
I-I-I can explain that.

315
00:13:40,322 --> 00:13:42,506
Uh, uh, she, she called me
at 2:00 in the morning,

316
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:44,186
and I-I thought
she was drunk and suicidal,

317
00:13:44,207 --> 00:13:45,914
but it turns out
she was just acting.

318
00:13:45,941 --> 00:13:48,484
Did you know she won
a People's Choice?

319
00:13:48,515 --> 00:13:50,482
B-B-But I swear
nothing happened.

320
00:13:50,492 --> 00:13:53,560
This doesn't look like nothing.

321
00:13:55,487 --> 00:13:58,723
Uh, okay, okay, but, but,
but what you can't see

322
00:13:58,767 --> 00:14:01,034
in that picture is,
is what I was thinking,

323
00:14:01,069 --> 00:14:04,290
and what I was thinking about
was you, the woman I lo...

324
00:14:04,334 --> 00:14:05,367
Hello?

325
00:14:06,455 --> 00:14:09,656
- Oh, man.
- Mm-mm, I'm sorry, buddy.

326
00:14:09,690 --> 00:14:11,452
Oh, look, you've
been identified

327
00:14:11,488 --> 00:14:14,235
as "Matthew
Broderick's father"

328
00:14:21,108 --> 00:14:24,124
There's the birthday girl.

329
00:14:25,601 --> 00:14:27,453
I'm not in the mood, Walden.

330
00:14:27,474 --> 00:14:30,108
There is a ton of weed in this.

331
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:32,562
Happy birthday to me.

332
00:14:36,857 --> 00:14:39,642
These photos are all
over the Internet.

333
00:14:39,672 --> 00:14:41,092
Oh, my God.

334
00:14:41,133 --> 00:14:43,429
Oh, my boobs look good
in this one.

335
00:14:43,448 --> 00:14:45,477
Yeah, your boobs look good,
your life is perfect,

336
00:14:45,492 --> 00:14:47,434
and I'm going
to die alone.

337
00:14:47,442 --> 00:14:48,653
Oh, Alan, I'm so sorry.

338
00:14:48,675 --> 00:14:50,075
What can I do to help?

339
00:14:50,098 --> 00:14:52,422
Talk to Lyndsey,
tell her nothing happened.

340
00:14:52,444 --> 00:14:54,231
She won't listen to me.

341
00:14:54,259 --> 00:14:56,360
- Of course.
- Thank you.

342
00:14:58,492 --> 00:15:00,568
It's her voice mail.

343
00:15:00,618 --> 00:15:02,248
She sounds very pretty.

344
00:15:02,276 --> 00:15:04,284
Just leave a message.

345
00:15:04,637 --> 00:15:06,486
Oh, hi, Lyndsey.

346
00:15:06,521 --> 00:15:10,122
It's Kandi, Alan's ex-wife
and TV's Jane Risotto.

347
00:15:10,166 --> 00:15:12,203
I'm here with Alan
in my hotel room and...

348
00:15:12,228 --> 00:15:14,086
- No.
- What?

349
00:15:15,264 --> 00:15:16,394
Got it.

350
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:18,153
Sorry, wrong number.

351
00:15:24,587 --> 00:15:27,822
So, basically,
the search results

352
00:15:27,846 --> 00:15:30,780
are processed through
the neural back end,

353
00:15:30,944 --> 00:15:33,185
which allows us
to serve ads

354
00:15:33,216 --> 00:15:37,487
that are based on trends that
are personalized for the user.

355
00:15:38,303 --> 00:15:41,807
Halfway through that,
your head turned into a taco.

356
00:15:48,621 --> 00:15:51,828
How cool is that?
A talking taco.

357
00:15:53,191 --> 00:15:55,731
Talking taco, talking taco,

358
00:15:55,751 --> 00:15:57,751
talking taco.

359
00:15:57,941 --> 00:16:00,341
Oh, geez, I am really high.

360
00:16:02,256 --> 00:16:05,458
There must have been a cat
tranquilizer in that cupcake.

361
00:16:05,921 --> 00:16:07,554
Woof.

362
00:16:17,644 --> 00:16:20,908
I got to tell you, Walden,
I never thought

363
00:16:20,954 --> 00:16:23,692
that I could work
for anybody but Charlie,

364
00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:25,022
but

365
00:16:25,099 --> 00:16:27,866
you're a good guy.

366
00:16:27,988 --> 00:16:29,822
That means a lot.

367
00:16:29,852 --> 00:16:31,583
And if truth be told,

368
00:16:31,594 --> 00:16:34,695
I don't even mind seeing Zippy
every day.

369
00:16:35,012 --> 00:16:37,259
Whoa!

370
00:16:37,383 --> 00:16:39,711
I must be higher
than I thought.

371
00:16:46,225 --> 00:16:48,014
You know...

372
00:16:48,538 --> 00:16:51,874
when I met you,
I was at a real low point,

373
00:16:52,287 --> 00:16:54,241
but you and Alan

374
00:16:54,272 --> 00:16:56,329
took care of me.

375
00:16:56,349 --> 00:16:59,595
I got to say,
other than my mother,

376
00:16:59,745 --> 00:17:02,934
you're the closest thing
I have to a family.

377
00:17:05,526 --> 00:17:07,828
I love you, Berta.

378
00:17:08,264 --> 00:17:11,116
You're a sentimental
little taco, aren't you?

379
00:17:19,362 --> 00:17:21,530
Hi, we need to talk.

380
00:17:22,053 --> 00:17:23,073
Go ahead.

381
00:17:23,108 --> 00:17:25,341
I know you're really upset,
but I promise,

382
00:17:25,358 --> 00:17:27,255
nothing happened
between me and Alan.

383
00:17:27,273 --> 00:17:28,457
I saw the pictures.

384
00:17:28,490 --> 00:17:29,489
Pictures lie.

385
00:17:29,507 --> 00:17:30,640
So do boyfriends.

386
00:17:30,649 --> 00:17:32,467
But not Alan.

387
00:17:32,508 --> 00:17:34,508
Did you really try
to seduce him?

388
00:17:34,536 --> 00:17:37,003
I did, but he turned me down.

389
00:17:37,026 --> 00:17:37,972
Wow.

390
00:17:37,992 --> 00:17:40,512
I was as surprised as you are.

391
00:17:40,906 --> 00:17:44,009
What about all that stuff
about you enjoying sex

392
00:17:44,041 --> 00:17:46,214
with Alan more than
with Derek Jeter?

393
00:17:46,237 --> 00:17:49,205
Oh, honey, you know
better than that.

394
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:54,774
Hola, Berta.

395
00:17:54,825 --> 00:17:57,729
Feliz birthday-o.

396
00:17:58,028 --> 00:17:59,994
Stop, you're
freaking me out.

397
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:05,595
Okay, all right,
I'm gonna call a cab.

398
00:18:05,621 --> 00:18:07,733
I'm too stoned
to drive.

399
00:18:11,168 --> 00:18:14,770
I may be too stoned
to call a cab.

400
00:18:15,705 --> 00:18:17,306
What about your car?

401
00:18:17,342 --> 00:18:20,018
Oh, you know, just drive it
to my house tomorrow.

402
00:18:20,044 --> 00:18:22,496
I don't know how to
drive that thing.

403
00:18:22,542 --> 00:18:25,305
Oh, come on, it's easy,
I'll show you.

404
00:18:25,328 --> 00:18:26,528
Here.

405
00:18:27,584 --> 00:18:29,585
Help me out here.

406
00:18:29,617 --> 00:18:31,376
Where is your door?

407
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:38,344
Happy birthday.

408
00:18:38,584 --> 00:18:40,883
Sweet Georgia Brown,

409
00:18:40,913 --> 00:18:43,146
you'd better not be
screwing with me.

410
00:18:43,179 --> 00:18:45,422
Nope, you always said
it was your dream car.

411
00:18:45,444 --> 00:18:46,699
Well, today
your dreams come true.

412
00:18:46,709 --> 00:18:47,775
Oh!

413
00:18:47,809 --> 00:18:50,808
Come here, you big
old talking taco.

414
00:18:51,104 --> 00:18:52,145
Oh.

415
00:18:53,296 --> 00:18:55,331
Oh, oh, there's
one condition.

416
00:18:55,356 --> 00:18:57,028
Okay, you want
to do it in the house

417
00:18:57,045 --> 00:18:59,570
or on the hood of the car?

418
00:18:59,870 --> 00:19:00,903
No.

419
00:19:01,012 --> 00:19:04,259
Hey, Alan can never
find out about this.

420
00:19:04,604 --> 00:19:07,260
Alan can never find
out about this.

421
00:19:07,319 --> 00:19:08,848
Mm-hmm.

422
00:19:14,410 --> 00:19:16,548
Oh, that is great, honey.

423
00:19:16,592 --> 00:19:18,787
Well, I-I will
talk to you later.

424
00:19:18,815 --> 00:19:20,979
Okay, okay,
bye-bye.

425
00:19:21,007 --> 00:19:23,078
Wow, Lyndsey's
in a better mood.

426
00:19:25,606 --> 00:19:28,732
It's like her head is in
a whole different place.

427
00:19:30,566 --> 00:19:32,568
Uh, uh, it's on.

428
00:19:32,602 --> 00:19:34,884
If you're not one
of the suspects...

429
00:19:34,931 --> 00:19:37,436
You're one of the Stiffs.

430
00:19:41,181 --> 00:19:43,534
God, she's hot.

431
00:19:43,594 --> 00:19:44,846
Yeah.

432
00:19:44,863 --> 00:19:46,470
Yeah.

433
00:19:48,197 --> 00:19:51,397
Excuse me, I'm gonna go
check the stock market.

434
00:19:54,743 --> 00:19:57,354
Guess what Walden bought me
for my birthday.

435
