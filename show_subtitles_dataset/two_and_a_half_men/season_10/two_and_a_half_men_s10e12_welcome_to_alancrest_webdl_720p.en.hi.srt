00:00:02,545 --> 00:00:04,077
Previously on
Two and a Half Men...

2
00:00:04,102 --> 00:00:05,588
I am determined to find

3
00:00:05,614 --> 00:00:06,891
someone who wants
to be with me

4
00:00:06,906 --> 00:00:09,149
for who I am, not what I have.

5
00:00:09,305 --> 00:00:11,280
My point is you can be whoever
you want to be.

6
00:00:11,298 --> 00:00:12,561
I can help you out with that.

7
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:14,642
I appreciate it... Kate.

8
00:00:14,828 --> 00:00:16,024
Sam Wilson.

9
00:00:16,046 --> 00:00:17,800
Maybe you could crash here.

10
00:00:17,824 --> 00:00:18,873
Have you really
thought this through?

11
00:00:18,904 --> 00:00:21,066
I got to see
where this goes with Kate.

12
00:00:21,125 --> 00:00:22,458
I think it is great

13
00:00:22,483 --> 00:00:24,662
that you're working on
your computer stuff,

14
00:00:24,688 --> 00:00:26,216
but we need help now.

15
00:00:26,237 --> 00:00:27,498
Say no more.

16
00:00:27,574 --> 00:00:29,912
I'll start looking
for a job.

17
00:00:34,171 --> 00:00:35,273
Hey.

18
00:00:35,372 --> 00:00:38,380
Oh, look who finally
decided to show up.

19
00:00:38,776 --> 00:00:40,667
Uh, yeah, I got
stuck in traffic.

20
00:00:40,687 --> 00:00:41,928
Traffic, pfft.

21
00:00:41,942 --> 00:00:44,151
You were with her,
weren't you?

22
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:46,206
Really, Alan?

23
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:47,933
Well, I don't mean to sound
like a broken record,

24
00:00:47,975 --> 00:00:49,566
but you're never
home anymore.

25
00:00:49,589 --> 00:00:51,309
I was just there
the other night.

26
00:00:51,345 --> 00:00:52,644
And all you did
was watch the game

27
00:00:52,655 --> 00:00:54,121
and fall asleep.
Remember how we used

28
00:00:54,128 --> 00:00:56,412
to stay up all night
and just talk?

29
00:00:57,603 --> 00:00:59,726
Okay, you know, fine,
we can talk now.

30
00:00:59,739 --> 00:01:02,023
- What's on your mind?
- Nothing. I'm fine.

31
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:04,563
I'm not
a mind reader, Alan.

32
00:01:05,712 --> 00:01:08,523
Well, not that
you care, but...

33
00:01:08,556 --> 00:01:10,339
I'm rattling around
in that big house

34
00:01:10,369 --> 00:01:11,797
all by myself.

35
00:01:11,864 --> 00:01:14,431
I miss you.
There, I said it.

36
00:01:14,771 --> 00:01:16,021
I miss you, too.

37
00:01:16,081 --> 00:01:18,082
Well, you got a funny
way of showing it.

38
00:01:18,122 --> 00:01:20,557
You do understand I have
a girlfriend, right?

39
00:01:20,586 --> 00:01:21,484
So do I.

40
00:01:21,509 --> 00:01:23,812
A-Another peach
mojito, please.

41
00:01:23,879 --> 00:01:25,550
What are you drinking?
It's on me.

42
00:01:25,572 --> 00:01:27,166
And by "on me,"
I mean the money

43
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,923
you left me to
pay the bills,

44
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:30,439
which, incidentally,
I used for other stuff,

45
00:01:30,454 --> 00:01:32,463
so I'll need money
to pay the bills.

46
00:01:33,984 --> 00:01:35,880
I'll have
a ginger ale, please.

47
00:01:35,907 --> 00:01:37,190
Ginger ale?

48
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:39,230
Yeah, my stomach's
been bothering me.

49
00:01:39,249 --> 00:01:41,032
I haven't really been
feeling myself lately.

50
00:01:41,056 --> 00:01:42,221
Which self would
that be?

51
00:01:42,233 --> 00:01:43,779
Walden Schmidt
or Sam Wilson?

52
00:01:43,812 --> 00:01:46,465
Sam Wilson has
a lot of stress.

53
00:01:46,964 --> 00:01:48,102
Thank you.

54
00:01:48,188 --> 00:01:49,510
Money's tight.

55
00:01:49,523 --> 00:01:51,210
You'd be surprised
what that does to a guy.

56
00:01:51,239 --> 00:01:52,950
Please, I've been so
desperate for money,

57
00:01:52,976 --> 00:01:54,642
I've climbed into
fountains at night

58
00:01:54,644 --> 00:01:57,278
and stolen the
wishes of children.

59
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:58,746
So you get it.

60
00:01:58,767 --> 00:01:59,878
What I don't get
is why you don't

61
00:01:59,887 --> 00:02:01,771
resolve the stress and just
tell Kate the truth.

62
00:02:01,796 --> 00:02:02,918
That's not gonna happen.

63
00:02:02,943 --> 00:02:04,167
Why not?
I don't know,

64
00:02:04,188 --> 00:02:05,838
everything's
going so great,

65
00:02:05,863 --> 00:02:07,246
I don't want
to screw it up.

66
00:02:07,294 --> 00:02:09,492
Oh, that's not good.

I don't know whether this is
beef or chicken,

70
00:02:24,862 --> 00:02:27,369
but it's definitely
worth 79 cents.

71
00:02:30,301 --> 00:02:31,824
What's the matter?

72
00:02:31,885 --> 00:02:35,102
My life has been
a complete waste of time.

73
00:02:35,119 --> 00:02:37,836
Otherwise, I'm terrific.

74
00:02:38,376 --> 00:02:39,742
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

75
00:02:39,778 --> 00:02:41,725
Wait, is this...
is this one of

76
00:02:41,744 --> 00:02:43,094
the dresses you made?
Mm-hmm.

77
00:02:43,103 --> 00:02:44,492
Why are you throwing it away?

78
00:02:44,528 --> 00:02:47,446
Because, apparently...
my stuff's not good enough

79
00:02:47,498 --> 00:02:50,583
to get a job
that pays nothing.

80
00:02:50,625 --> 00:02:52,214
You didn't get the internship?

81
00:02:52,256 --> 00:02:55,707
Nope. Rejected by the guy
who assists the guy

82
00:02:55,749 --> 00:02:59,115
who assists the guy
who designs Snooki's

83
00:02:59,147 --> 00:03:02,565
signature line
of baby thongs.

84
00:03:02,607 --> 00:03:04,629
Okay, don't worry,
you're gonna get next one.

85
00:03:04,661 --> 00:03:07,092
There is no next one.

86
00:03:07,144 --> 00:03:09,011
I mean, obviously

87
00:03:09,063 --> 00:03:11,454
I don't have what it takes
to be a fashion designer.

88
00:03:11,495 --> 00:03:13,638
And at a certain point,
I just have to bite the bullet

89
00:03:13,681 --> 00:03:15,430
and admit it is not happening.

90
00:03:15,442 --> 00:03:17,142
But you're not at that point.

91
00:03:17,174 --> 00:03:18,640
Three words:

92
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:20,143
Snooki's...

93
00:03:20,254 --> 00:03:21,586
baby...

94
00:03:21,631 --> 00:03:23,109
thongs!

95
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:25,437
I think your designs are great.

96
00:03:25,466 --> 00:03:28,103
You have to say that;
I have sex with you.

97
00:03:29,424 --> 00:03:30,445
True.

98
00:03:30,476 --> 00:03:35,024
But if I was a woman,
I would totally wear this dress.

99
00:03:35,344 --> 00:03:36,944
Hell, three shots of tequila

100
00:03:36,976 --> 00:03:38,856
and I would wear this dress.

101
00:03:39,161 --> 00:03:41,263
And I would work it!

102
00:03:41,412 --> 00:03:44,334
Okay, don't make me laugh
when I'm trying to cry.

103
00:03:44,361 --> 00:03:46,460
Too late, because
I am fierce.

104
00:03:51,234 --> 00:03:52,634
I love you, Sam.

105
00:03:52,662 --> 00:03:55,497
Uh, you have to say that;
I have sex with you.

106
00:03:55,657 --> 00:03:58,007
Okay, the real test is,

107
00:03:58,041 --> 00:04:00,889
will you have sex with me
wearing that dress?

108
00:04:01,168 --> 00:04:03,912
You get the tequila,
I'll go put on some heels.

109
00:04:07,742 --> 00:04:09,876
Lightly salted,
just the way you like.

110
00:04:09,878 --> 00:04:11,661
Mm, thanks.

111
00:04:11,663 --> 00:04:13,580
Who could've seen
this coming?

112
00:04:13,582 --> 00:04:14,547
Right.

113
00:04:14,712 --> 00:04:16,810
We end up with the house.

114
00:04:17,103 --> 00:04:18,802
Unbelievable.

115
00:04:18,854 --> 00:04:20,470
You know how
I used to say

116
00:04:20,479 --> 00:04:22,287
you'd have to pay me
to hang out with you?

117
00:04:22,307 --> 00:04:23,133
Yeah.

118
00:04:23,155 --> 00:04:25,028
Here we are!

119
00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:27,856
Hey, guys.

120
00:04:27,875 --> 00:04:28,806
Mm.
Mm!

121
00:04:28,821 --> 00:04:31,051
Oh, Look who it is.
Sam Wilson.

122
00:04:31,082 --> 00:04:31,964
Hey, Alan,

123
00:04:31,978 --> 00:04:33,315
can I, can I talk to you
for a second?

124
00:04:33,324 --> 00:04:34,437
Oh, sure.

125
00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:36,770
The principal wants to see me.
Mm.

126
00:04:37,822 --> 00:04:40,727
Oh, uh, Berta,
I brought some laundry by.

127
00:04:40,747 --> 00:04:42,011
Uh, do you mind?

128
00:04:42,033 --> 00:04:44,734
It's your machine.
Knock yourself out.

129
00:04:48,294 --> 00:04:49,536
So, what's up?

130
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:52,427
I'm transferring $100,000
into your bank account.

131
00:04:52,675 --> 00:04:54,726
A hundred... thousand...

132
00:04:55,945 --> 00:04:57,227
Catch me, Lord.

133
00:04:58,348 --> 00:04:59,076
Uh-oh, uh-oh.

134
00:04:59,094 --> 00:05:00,510
I-I think I need
to sit down.

135
00:05:00,529 --> 00:05:01,853
Yeah, yeah.
I...

136
00:05:01,873 --> 00:05:03,913
I-I could swear
that I heard you say

137
00:05:03,915 --> 00:05:05,932
you were gonna put
$100,000 into my account.

138
00:05:05,934 --> 00:05:06,966
I am.

139
00:05:06,968 --> 00:05:09,135
There it goes again.

140
00:05:09,289 --> 00:05:11,704
It's-it's like the teacups
at Disneyland.

141
00:05:11,926 --> 00:05:13,832
How can I ever thank you?

142
00:05:13,859 --> 00:05:15,703
The money's not for you,
it's for Kate.

143
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:17,590
Next time, lead with that.

144
00:05:17,612 --> 00:05:19,869
I want you to invest
in her fashion designs.

145
00:05:19,969 --> 00:05:21,655
What?
She's really talented,

146
00:05:21,668 --> 00:05:23,318
but nobody will
give her a shot.

147
00:05:23,344 --> 00:05:24,908
Are you sure she's talented?

148
00:05:24,936 --> 00:05:26,602
It isn't just
boom-shaka-laka-laka,

149
00:05:26,643 --> 00:05:28,360
boom-shaka-laka-laka?

150
00:05:29,306 --> 00:05:31,883
I'm about to give you
a boom-shaka-laka.

151
00:05:32,827 --> 00:05:35,899
No, $100,000 will help
her start her company.

152
00:05:35,935 --> 00:05:37,365
So give it to her.
I can't.

153
00:05:37,378 --> 00:05:39,124
I'm Sam Wilson.
I'm broke.

154
00:05:39,149 --> 00:05:41,299
But you can,
because you're

155
00:05:41,317 --> 00:05:43,335
Alan Harper,
billionaire.

156
00:05:43,361 --> 00:05:45,561
Oh...

157
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:49,809
Fashion's kind of risky.

158
00:05:51,422 --> 00:05:53,573
And Alan Harper did not
become a billionaire

159
00:05:53,598 --> 00:05:55,884
by taking unnecessary risks.

160
00:05:56,017 --> 00:05:58,775
You are taking an
unnecessary risk right now.

161
00:05:58,796 --> 00:06:01,834
No, I-I'm just saying that I'd
rather put my money into gold,

162
00:06:01,866 --> 00:06:03,315
or maybe start a vineyard.

163
00:06:03,338 --> 00:06:04,787
Alancrest.

164
00:06:05,791 --> 00:06:08,331
You know, fine, when
you make $100,000—

165
00:06:08,352 --> 00:06:10,364
I don't even have
to finish that.

166
00:06:10,813 --> 00:06:13,669
I-I want my money
invested in Kate.

167
00:06:13,693 --> 00:06:15,586
Okay, no problem.

168
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:18,588
But I'll have to see
some of her sketches first.

169
00:06:18,702 --> 00:06:19,398
Alan.

170
00:06:19,416 --> 00:06:22,114
What? You want this to be
believable, don't you?

171
00:06:22,237 --> 00:06:23,059
Okay, fine.

172
00:06:23,074 --> 00:06:24,171
Have us over
tomorrow night.

173
00:06:24,185 --> 00:06:25,745
Ooh, kind of short notice.

174
00:06:25,764 --> 00:06:26,918
Alan!

175
00:06:27,004 --> 00:06:28,880
Can't we do this at your house?

176
00:06:29,049 --> 00:06:30,823
This is my house!

177
00:06:34,641 --> 00:06:37,428
Awfully rude for a guy
who wants my money.

178
00:06:49,531 --> 00:06:52,611
It's like you've never
washed a dish in your life.

179
00:06:53,528 --> 00:06:55,214
What are you
talking about?

180
00:06:55,229 --> 00:06:58,190
There's still SpaghettiOs
on this plate.

181
00:07:00,406 --> 00:07:02,342
Well, you're the one
that wanted to be all fancy

182
00:07:02,371 --> 00:07:05,256
and said we couldn't eat them
straight out of the can.

183
00:07:05,642 --> 00:07:06,586
Ugh.

184
00:07:06,618 --> 00:07:09,605
Oh, speaking of fancy,
I saw Alan today.

185
00:07:09,641 --> 00:07:10,993
Ew.

186
00:07:11,276 --> 00:07:14,160
It was actually a really
interesting conversation.

187
00:07:14,229 --> 00:07:16,646
He's looking for some
new investments.

188
00:07:16,686 --> 00:07:19,471
He should go and buy himself
a better personality.

189
00:07:19,707 --> 00:07:21,729
Nobody's that rich.

190
00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:25,265
Uh, but I did tell him
that you're trying to start

191
00:07:25,289 --> 00:07:26,680
your own fashion company.

192
00:07:26,701 --> 00:07:28,367
Oh, Sam, you didn't.

193
00:07:28,394 --> 00:07:30,027
Oh, but I did.

194
00:07:30,728 --> 00:07:32,412
Well, he's in a position
to help you.

195
00:07:32,428 --> 00:07:34,172
I don't want his help.

196
00:07:34,191 --> 00:07:35,576
Unless I'm gonna start
a line called

197
00:07:35,591 --> 00:07:37,175
House of Douche.

198
00:07:38,074 --> 00:07:39,373
Don't be ridiculous.

199
00:07:39,401 --> 00:07:41,718
I'm sure that name's
already taken.

200
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:44,503
Hey, he could be the answer
to all your problems.

201
00:07:44,523 --> 00:07:46,006
Oh, I don't know.

202
00:07:46,046 --> 00:07:47,409
Before you say no,

203
00:07:47,490 --> 00:07:49,406
he invited us over
tomorrow night

204
00:07:49,428 --> 00:07:51,428
so you can show him
your designs.

205
00:07:52,517 --> 00:07:54,255
Really think he'd invest in me?

206
00:07:54,302 --> 00:07:55,969
He'd have to be an idiot not to.

207
00:07:55,986 --> 00:07:57,816
But he is an idiot.

208
00:07:59,107 --> 00:08:00,310
True.

209
00:08:01,547 --> 00:08:02,964
Give it a chance?

210
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:04,416
All right.

211
00:08:04,453 --> 00:08:05,417
I'll do it.

212
00:08:05,442 --> 00:08:08,396
Great. Oh, did I mention
that if you take his money,

213
00:08:08,415 --> 00:08:09,511
you have to
sleep with him?

214
00:08:11,369 --> 00:08:13,537
I'm kidding;
I'll totally do him.

215
00:08:24,114 --> 00:08:25,934
Ah! Sam, Kate.

216
00:08:25,959 --> 00:08:27,796
Welcome to Alancrest.

217
00:08:27,965 --> 00:08:29,907
W-Why are you
wearing pajamas?

218
00:08:29,925 --> 00:08:31,749
I'm rich. I can.

219
00:08:31,984 --> 00:08:33,877
Mm. You have
a beautiful home.

220
00:08:33,890 --> 00:08:36,049
It'll work
until my castle's finished.

221
00:08:36,362 --> 00:08:38,119
Entrez-vous.

222
00:08:38,146 --> 00:08:40,866
Uh, that's French for
"enter, you."

223
00:08:41,336 --> 00:08:42,095
Oh, look,

224
00:08:42,117 --> 00:08:44,282
my panoramic ocean view.

225
00:08:44,317 --> 00:08:46,650
You can follow my
seagulls on Twitter.

226
00:08:47,074 --> 00:08:49,371
Hashtag, "Gulls gone wild."

227
00:08:50,608 --> 00:08:52,261
Oh, ah, delightful!

228
00:08:52,283 --> 00:08:54,193
Thank you, Berta.
That will be all.

229
00:08:54,232 --> 00:08:56,366
Damn right it will!

230
00:08:56,799 --> 00:08:59,449
She's been
with the family for years.

231
00:08:59,461 --> 00:09:00,843
They say you're not really rich

232
00:09:00,869 --> 00:09:03,241
until you have servants
who hate you.

233
00:09:03,501 --> 00:09:05,890
Uh, Alan, Kate brought
her portfolio to show you.

234
00:09:05,924 --> 00:09:06,933
Oh, yes!

235
00:09:06,956 --> 00:09:08,506
Kate, please
take a seat.

236
00:09:08,524 --> 00:09:10,120
Take my breath away!

237
00:09:10,147 --> 00:09:11,878
Oh, I'd love to.

238
00:09:12,737 --> 00:09:15,381
I made some new sketches
just for you.

239
00:09:15,415 --> 00:09:17,456
Uh, yeah, she's been
working really hard on them.

240
00:09:17,472 --> 00:09:19,283
I-I think you're really
gonna like what you see.

241
00:09:19,303 --> 00:09:20,781
No offense, Sam,

242
00:09:20,798 --> 00:09:22,998
but look at the
way you dress.

243
00:09:23,989 --> 00:09:24,979
Mm.

244
00:09:25,004 --> 00:09:26,303
All right.

245
00:09:26,739 --> 00:09:28,538
Oh, it's-it's nice.

246
00:09:28,563 --> 00:09:30,280
No, I-I like
what you did here.

247
00:09:30,304 --> 00:09:31,369
Thank you.

248
00:09:32,169 --> 00:09:34,232
Uh, cap sleeves are
last season, but,

249
00:09:34,246 --> 00:09:36,479
you know, okay.

250
00:09:36,849 --> 00:09:38,283
Oh, you know,
I'm kind of done

251
00:09:38,304 --> 00:09:40,754
with rompers, but I understand
what you're going for.

252
00:09:41,924 --> 00:09:43,191
Oh, oh.

253
00:09:43,210 --> 00:09:44,543
Velvet.

254
00:09:44,564 --> 00:09:46,210
Kind of whorish.

255
00:09:46,619 --> 00:09:48,150
- Excuse me?
- Okay.

256
00:09:48,173 --> 00:09:51,123
You know what, uh, Kate,
why don't you run out to the car

257
00:09:51,150 --> 00:09:52,435
and grab some of your samples.

258
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:54,348
I think Alan would
love to see them.

259
00:09:54,370 --> 00:09:55,919
Yeah, sure.

260
00:09:55,935 --> 00:09:58,553
Just hope
they're not too whorish.

261
00:09:58,987 --> 00:09:59,709
Yeah.

262
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:02,112
Let's leave that
to Lady Gaga.

263
00:10:04,542 --> 00:10:05,767
Ow!

264
00:10:06,386 --> 00:10:08,568
What the hell
is the matter with you?

265
00:10:08,611 --> 00:10:11,028
Me? She's the one
who paired an empire waist

266
00:10:11,052 --> 00:10:12,927
with a Peter Pan collar!

267
00:10:12,952 --> 00:10:17,994
You're supposed to be a simple
rich guy, not a gay Bruce Wayne.

268
00:10:18,761 --> 00:10:21,063
Hey, hey, you have
your character, I have mine.

269
00:10:21,090 --> 00:10:23,724
Well, your character is a
festering heap of human waste!

270
00:10:23,752 --> 00:10:26,372
I think we both know, if I had
money, I'd be the biggest

271
00:10:26,411 --> 00:10:29,341
festering heap of human waste
that ever lived!

272
00:10:30,041 --> 00:10:32,925
All you have to do is tell her
that you want to invest

273
00:10:32,952 --> 00:10:34,921
and give her my $100,000.

274
00:10:34,954 --> 00:10:37,479
Well, fine,
but velvet is whorish.

275
00:10:38,139 --> 00:10:39,602
Okay, here we are.

276
00:10:39,634 --> 00:10:41,905
Uh, let's see.

277
00:10:42,396 --> 00:10:45,147
This is a cute, little shift

278
00:10:45,169 --> 00:10:46,367
that goes from
day to night.

279
00:10:46,391 --> 00:10:48,570
I love them all!
What?

280
00:10:48,601 --> 00:10:49,754
You-you haven't even seen them.

281
00:10:49,778 --> 00:10:52,111
I've seen
all I need to see, Kate.

282
00:10:52,135 --> 00:10:54,469
I want to invest in
your line of clothing.

283
00:10:54,488 --> 00:10:55,216
Really?

284
00:10:55,233 --> 00:10:56,232
Yes! Now tell me,

285
00:10:56,244 --> 00:10:57,283
what's our
business plan?

286
00:10:57,285 --> 00:10:58,957
Well, it depends.
If I had enough money,

287
00:10:58,984 --> 00:11:01,185
I'd put a show together for
Fashion Week in New York.

288
00:11:01,203 --> 00:11:01,827
That way, I'd be able to...

289
00:11:01,843 --> 00:11:04,336
Sounds great. Pack
your bags for New York,

290
00:11:04,367 --> 00:11:09,036
because I'm gonna write
you a check for $50,000.

291
00:11:09,442 --> 00:11:11,106
What?

292
00:11:11,132 --> 00:11:12,498
Sam, did you hear that?

293
00:11:12,517 --> 00:11:13,933
Uh, yeah, I did.

294
00:11:13,952 --> 00:11:15,260
What's the— $50,000?

295
00:11:15,274 --> 00:11:16,909
I-I know it's a lot.

296
00:11:16,930 --> 00:11:19,580
But I believe in her, and
I want to take a chance.

297
00:11:19,817 --> 00:11:20,712
Uh, well,

298
00:11:20,725 --> 00:11:22,693
if you really believe
in her, maybe you'd...

299
00:11:22,721 --> 00:11:24,506
maybe you'd like to invest
a little bit more.

300
00:11:24,541 --> 00:11:25,156
Sam.

301
00:11:25,172 --> 00:11:27,380
No, no, no.
He's right.

302
00:11:28,004 --> 00:11:30,454
I'm gonna hate
myself for this.

303
00:11:31,329 --> 00:11:33,283
But what the heck.

304
00:11:33,335 --> 00:11:35,626
$60,000.

305
00:11:43,509 --> 00:11:47,083
I can't believe Alan
gave me $100,000.

306
00:11:47,143 --> 00:11:50,224
I can't believe
it took him two hours to do it.

307
00:11:51,332 --> 00:11:52,803
Thank you.

308
00:11:52,841 --> 00:11:55,132
What are you thanking me for?

309
00:11:55,176 --> 00:11:58,227
Because I know none of this
would've happened without you.

310
00:11:58,273 --> 00:12:00,514
I just introduced you.

311
00:12:00,548 --> 00:12:02,932
Your whorish velvet
did the rest.

312
00:12:05,854 --> 00:12:07,854
You are the sweetest...

313
00:12:09,043 --> 00:12:10,540
most generous...

314
00:12:10,815 --> 00:12:12,650
open, giving...

315
00:12:12,894 --> 00:12:15,515
caring, genuine person
I've ever met, Sam Wilson.

316
00:12:15,565 --> 00:12:18,016
That's me.

317
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:20,540
Good old Sam Wilson.

318
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:24,699
This whole thing...
is incredible.

319
00:12:24,739 --> 00:12:26,541
I am so excited.

320
00:12:26,597 --> 00:12:27,987
Me, too.

321
00:12:29,711 --> 00:12:31,309
Are you sure?

322
00:12:31,343 --> 00:12:32,431
What do you mean?

323
00:12:32,452 --> 00:12:34,676
Well, it just
seems like, um,

324
00:12:34,767 --> 00:12:37,735
Little Sam doesn't have
his head in the game.

325
00:12:37,786 --> 00:12:39,068
Um...

326
00:12:40,053 --> 00:12:41,427
Yeah.

327
00:12:42,266 --> 00:12:43,498
I...

328
00:12:43,569 --> 00:12:45,446
Maybe I just need a minute.

329
00:12:45,754 --> 00:12:47,349
Okay.

330
00:12:51,582 --> 00:12:53,750
Do you think I'm fat?

331
00:13:09,150 --> 00:13:10,182
Alan.

332
00:13:10,213 --> 00:13:11,897
Wake up.

333
00:13:11,899 --> 00:13:14,433
Mm... what, what?

334
00:13:15,001 --> 00:13:16,151
Walden.

335
00:13:16,179 --> 00:13:18,707
What-what am I doing
in your bed?

336
00:13:19,352 --> 00:13:22,204
I... I-I must have
been sleepwalking, I...

337
00:13:22,242 --> 00:13:24,628
Relax, Alan,
I just want to talk.

338
00:13:24,659 --> 00:13:25,970
What's going on?

339
00:13:25,996 --> 00:13:27,305
It's 3:00 in the morning.

340
00:13:27,318 --> 00:13:29,151
I... I haven't been able
to sleep lately.

341
00:13:29,192 --> 00:13:30,826
In fact, my
whole life

342
00:13:30,856 --> 00:13:32,241
is falling apart.

343
00:13:32,271 --> 00:13:35,491
I'm, like, I'm losing my hair,
I'm gaining weight,

344
00:13:35,515 --> 00:13:38,103
I'm all itchy
and twitchy, I...

345
00:13:38,134 --> 00:13:40,523
I haven't had
a solid stool in a week.

346
00:13:40,805 --> 00:13:43,838
So far, you're describing
my typical Tuesday.

347
00:13:44,358 --> 00:13:46,377
The worst part is...

348
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:48,654
I can't get an erection.

349
00:13:49,893 --> 00:13:51,994
All right, just let me
brush my teeth.

350
00:13:53,758 --> 00:13:55,926
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, uh...

351
00:14:00,633 --> 00:14:01,917
What?

352
00:14:02,427 --> 00:14:03,627
What?

353
00:14:04,719 --> 00:14:06,386
Oh, uh, yeah, you know,

354
00:14:06,422 --> 00:14:07,872
I'm kind of,
I'm kind of half-asleep.

355
00:14:07,890 --> 00:14:09,676
Yeah, wow.

356
00:14:09,715 --> 00:14:11,165
Wow, that's a...
that is a problem.

357
00:14:11,182 --> 00:14:12,654
Yeah, yeah.

358
00:14:18,389 --> 00:14:20,202
Has this ever happened
to you before?

359
00:14:20,226 --> 00:14:21,357
Oh, me? No, no.

360
00:14:21,377 --> 00:14:23,627
I, uh, I have
amazing control.

361
00:14:23,663 --> 00:14:25,563
Wait, watch this.

362
00:14:28,194 --> 00:14:29,869
Got an erection.

363
00:14:33,032 --> 00:14:34,791
Now it's gone.

364
00:14:37,184 --> 00:14:38,518
Back.

365
00:14:38,802 --> 00:14:39,963
Gone.

366
00:14:40,102 --> 00:14:41,134
Are you done?

367
00:14:41,152 --> 00:14:42,394
Back.

368
00:14:44,896 --> 00:14:46,137
Gone.

369
00:14:47,057 --> 00:14:50,238
Look, every guy has
this happen at some point.

370
00:14:50,304 --> 00:14:53,177
It's never happened to me before
and it's driving me crazy.

371
00:14:53,217 --> 00:14:55,553
You know, it's possible that the
problem is not in your pants.

372
00:14:55,579 --> 00:14:57,213
Oh, no, no, no, no.

373
00:14:57,258 --> 00:14:59,959
The problem is
definitely in my pants.

374
00:14:59,967 --> 00:15:01,083
No, look at you.

375
00:15:01,101 --> 00:15:02,782
I mean, the stress
of living a lie

376
00:15:02,807 --> 00:15:04,807
is causing you
to just fall apart.

377
00:15:04,839 --> 00:15:06,038
You're binge eating.

378
00:15:06,057 --> 00:15:07,890
No, I am not
binge eating.

379
00:15:07,932 --> 00:15:10,983
You get a free candy bar
when you buy four corn dogs.

380
00:15:12,168 --> 00:15:14,398
That's just
smart shopping.

381
00:15:14,436 --> 00:15:16,689
This all started
when you became Sam Wilson,

382
00:15:16,708 --> 00:15:18,693
and I submit to you
that he's the one

383
00:15:18,714 --> 00:15:21,280
who can't pop his weasel,
not Walden Schmidt.

384
00:15:21,321 --> 00:15:23,333
Why don't you just
tell Kate the truth?

385
00:15:23,366 --> 00:15:26,168
I'm afraid if I'm honest
with her now,

386
00:15:26,181 --> 00:15:28,085
she'll just leave me.

387
00:15:28,115 --> 00:15:30,457
Okay, well, if you want
your boner back,

388
00:15:30,472 --> 00:15:32,215
you're gonna have to, you know,
tell her the truth

389
00:15:32,229 --> 00:15:33,496
and trust that the strength

390
00:15:33,511 --> 00:15:35,211
of your love will carry
you through...

391
00:15:35,231 --> 00:15:36,171
Or?

392
00:15:36,256 --> 00:15:38,950
Or you're gonna need
a little help.

393
00:15:39,289 --> 00:15:41,272
All right,
go brush your teeth.

394
00:15:45,512 --> 00:15:47,072
I'm kidding!

395
00:15:47,790 --> 00:15:49,461
Yeah, yeah.

396
00:15:49,479 --> 00:15:50,817
'Cause-'cause that'd be weird.

397
00:15:52,522 --> 00:15:54,579
Look, what I meant was
that I happen

398
00:15:54,599 --> 00:15:56,407
to know a 65-year-old man

399
00:15:56,435 --> 00:15:58,644
who'll give you
a stiffy in no time.

400
00:16:00,503 --> 00:16:02,729
Okay, that also sounded weird.

401
00:16:04,404 --> 00:16:06,007
And it's back.

402
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:11,548
All right, Walden,
how hard do you want it?

403
00:16:11,579 --> 00:16:14,804
Redwood tree, tungsten steel
or Chinese algebra?

404
00:16:14,981 --> 00:16:17,431
I'm not looking
to frighten anybody.

405
00:16:17,463 --> 00:16:18,712
Really?

406
00:16:18,737 --> 00:16:22,228
I like eyes to widen
when I unsheathe the sword.

407
00:16:23,142 --> 00:16:24,876
Well, tell you what.

408
00:16:24,898 --> 00:16:27,184
Why don't I just put together
a little grab bag for you.

409
00:16:27,216 --> 00:16:28,403
I got one of those.

410
00:16:28,417 --> 00:16:30,238
I call it
"boner roulette."

411
00:16:30,264 --> 00:16:31,685
You never know what
you're gonna get,

412
00:16:31,715 --> 00:16:33,715
but you're a
wiener every time.

413
00:16:34,832 --> 00:16:35,947
I'm gonna
start you off

414
00:16:35,959 --> 00:16:37,342
with a couple of pink ones here.

415
00:16:37,346 --> 00:16:39,580
These are good
for a mid-week quickie.

416
00:16:39,773 --> 00:16:41,389
And these green ones

417
00:16:41,415 --> 00:16:43,649
I recommend for solo work.

418
00:16:44,411 --> 00:16:45,080
Oh!

419
00:16:45,096 --> 00:16:46,853
This one I call "Ouch."

420
00:16:48,038 --> 00:16:49,654
That's her, not you.

421
00:16:49,663 --> 00:16:51,013
Oh, oh, the
purple ones.

422
00:16:51,027 --> 00:16:53,260
I couldn't remember where
I lived for a week.

423
00:16:53,289 --> 00:16:54,957
Knocked on every door
in the neighborhood,

424
00:16:54,971 --> 00:16:56,504
and not with my hand.

425
00:16:57,503 --> 00:16:58,641
And, Walden,

426
00:16:58,653 --> 00:17:00,515
this last one
I'm throwing in here, um,

427
00:17:00,554 --> 00:17:03,119
just take half of it,
because, technically,

428
00:17:03,158 --> 00:17:05,609
it's "only for horses."

429
00:17:06,682 --> 00:17:09,337
Don't... don't I need
a prescription for these?

430
00:17:09,997 --> 00:17:12,047
What are you, a cop?

431
00:17:12,135 --> 00:17:13,887
Don't worry,
Russell, he's cool.

432
00:17:13,914 --> 00:17:15,418
Okay, well,

433
00:17:15,452 --> 00:17:16,789
there you go.

434
00:17:16,808 --> 00:17:18,558
And since you're a friend
of a friend,

435
00:17:18,601 --> 00:17:21,769
I should read you
the possible side effects.

436
00:17:22,165 --> 00:17:24,712
"Headaches, dry mouth,
blurred vision, facial flushing,

437
00:17:24,735 --> 00:17:26,742
"inflamed bursa sac,
vertigo, fits of rage,

438
00:17:26,771 --> 00:17:28,457
"homicidal, patricidal,
matricidal

439
00:17:28,488 --> 00:17:30,538
"and suicidal thoughts,
stroke, anal leakage,

440
00:17:30,574 --> 00:17:32,977
"explosive diarrhea,
nipple discoloration, death,

441
00:17:33,002 --> 00:17:35,531
and difficulty
achieving an erection."

442
00:17:36,748 --> 00:17:37,717
Huh.

443
00:17:37,753 --> 00:17:40,087
That explains my
yellow nipples.

444
00:17:41,590 --> 00:17:42,766
You know what?

445
00:17:42,786 --> 00:17:46,204
Maybe I'll just go with
the basic little blue pill.

446
00:17:46,376 --> 00:17:48,960
Well, suit yourself, Sally.

447
00:17:49,595 --> 00:17:50,861
Here you go.

448
00:17:50,887 --> 00:17:52,270
Don't want these to go to waste.

449
00:17:52,301 --> 00:17:54,334
That little waitress
down at Ruby Tuesday's

450
00:17:54,366 --> 00:17:56,523
is never gonna know
what hit her.

451
00:18:06,122 --> 00:18:07,394
Sam?

452
00:18:08,947 --> 00:18:10,531
What's going on?

453
00:18:10,564 --> 00:18:12,569
Guess who's back.

454
00:18:13,018 --> 00:18:14,507
Well, hello!

455
00:18:14,534 --> 00:18:16,452
I haven't seen you in a while.

456
00:18:16,496 --> 00:18:19,897
Hey, Kate, I've missed you.

457
00:18:21,542 --> 00:18:22,916
Okay, that's creepy.

458
00:18:22,946 --> 00:18:24,279
I'm gonna stop doing that.

459
00:18:24,305 --> 00:18:26,793
Good, because I can't stay

460
00:18:26,812 --> 00:18:29,149
and I wouldn't want you to think
it's because I wasn't enchanted

461
00:18:29,174 --> 00:18:30,919
by your talking penis.

462
00:18:30,987 --> 00:18:32,263
Where you going?

463
00:18:32,281 --> 00:18:34,474
I actually just came back
to grab some designs.

464
00:18:34,490 --> 00:18:36,477
Plus, I've got a million things
to do before I leave

465
00:18:36,498 --> 00:18:39,295
for New York tomorrow, but I
promise when I get back tonight,

466
00:18:39,343 --> 00:18:40,842
I will make it up to you.

467
00:18:40,876 --> 00:18:42,403
And you.

468
00:18:42,776 --> 00:18:43,762
Bye.

469
00:18:43,793 --> 00:18:45,167
We'll be here.

470
00:18:48,484 --> 00:18:50,218
Hold me.

471
00:18:52,549 --> 00:18:54,116
Shut up.

472
00:18:54,189 --> 00:18:57,240
Come on,
we both know how this ends.

473
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,843
Are you sure
you don't want me

474
00:19:03,868 --> 00:19:05,277
to give you a ride
to the airport?

475
00:19:05,297 --> 00:19:07,312
No, Alan's
sending a limo.

476
00:19:07,337 --> 00:19:09,265
He's a class act.

477
00:19:09,756 --> 00:19:13,005
Yeah, I just... I just feel
like I should come with you.

478
00:19:13,038 --> 00:19:14,955
Sam, I would love
for you to come,

479
00:19:14,989 --> 00:19:17,539
but I just wouldn't feel right
spending Alan's money

480
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:19,498
to fly my boyfriend
across the country.

481
00:19:19,518 --> 00:19:22,319
And it's not like
you or I have the money.

482
00:19:22,379 --> 00:19:24,550
What if I told you
I had plenty of money?

483
00:19:24,598 --> 00:19:28,183
I would ask you why you didn't
help me instead of Alan.

484
00:19:28,475 --> 00:19:30,956
That would be a fair question.

485
00:19:31,261 --> 00:19:33,683
Honey, you are so sweet.

486
00:19:33,739 --> 00:19:37,132
And hopefully one day,
money won't be an issue for us.

487
00:19:37,872 --> 00:19:39,466
Hope you're right.

488
00:19:41,701 --> 00:19:43,801
That's the car.
I got to go.

489
00:19:49,091 --> 00:19:50,679
Um, good luck.

490
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:53,075
I'll miss you.

491
00:19:53,162 --> 00:19:54,869
I love you, Sam.

492
00:20:01,724 --> 00:20:03,940
My name is Walden Schmidt.

493
00:20:04,978 --> 00:20:06,914
I'm a billionaire.

494
00:20:08,131 --> 00:20:10,184
I love you, too.

495
00:20:10,705 --> 00:20:13,072
I don't care what your name is.

496
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,556
Hello?

497
00:20:33,787 --> 00:20:34,954
Walden?

498
00:20:34,987 --> 00:20:35,819
Alan?

499
00:20:35,853 --> 00:20:36,935
What do you want?

500
00:20:36,984 --> 00:20:39,601
I'm just checking up
on you, buddy.

501
00:20:39,634 --> 00:20:41,584
I'm fine! Go away!

502
00:20:41,602 --> 00:20:43,030
Uh, are you sure?

503
00:20:43,078 --> 00:20:44,818
I haven't seen you in a while.

504
00:20:44,868 --> 00:20:47,018
I tell you, I'm fine!

505
00:20:51,135 --> 00:20:52,702
Why is it so dark in here?

506
00:20:52,736 --> 00:20:54,402
Alan, no!

507
00:20:57,969 --> 00:21:01,073
Holy... fat.

508
00:21:02,777 --> 00:21:04,889
Don't judge me.

509
00:21:06,128 --> 00:21:09,040
You didn't, by chance,
bring any nacho cheese, did you?

510
