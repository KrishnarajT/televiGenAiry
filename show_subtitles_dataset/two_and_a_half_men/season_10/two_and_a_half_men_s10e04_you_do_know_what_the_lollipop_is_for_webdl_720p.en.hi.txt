1
00:00:06,951 --> 00:00:08,069
Hey.

2
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:10,270
Hey.

3
00:00:14,558 --> 00:00:15,326
Everything okay?

4
00:00:15,327 --> 00:00:17,261
Yeah.

5
00:00:17,263 --> 00:00:20,414
I just can't remember
what I came down here for.

6
00:00:20,416 --> 00:00:23,784
Oh. That happens
to me all the time.

7
00:00:23,786 --> 00:00:27,988
I-I can't remember
a specific example, but yeah.

8
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:29,673
Yeah, that's annoying.

9
00:00:29,675 --> 00:00:30,874
Uh, maybe you were hungry.

10
00:00:30,876 --> 00:00:32,709
Did you come down
to get something to eat?

11
00:00:32,711 --> 00:00:34,544
No, I just ate.

12
00:00:34,546 --> 00:00:35,862
Were you going to watch TV?

13
00:00:35,864 --> 00:00:38,599
No. I have a TV
in my room.

14
00:00:38,601 --> 00:00:40,584
This is very disconcerting.

15
00:00:40,586 --> 00:00:43,670
Don't panic. I mean,
we'll figure this out.

16
00:00:43,672 --> 00:00:45,355
Did you come down
to give me the money you owe me?

17
00:00:45,357 --> 00:00:47,057
Ah.

18
00:00:47,059 --> 00:00:48,942
It's worth a shot.

19
00:00:48,944 --> 00:00:51,645
No. I was upstairs,
and I thought to myself,

20
00:00:51,647 --> 00:00:54,364
"I need
to come downstairs and..."

21
00:00:58,037 --> 00:01:00,020
You know what might help?

22
00:01:00,022 --> 00:01:01,204
A little less...

23
00:01:01,206 --> 00:01:03,123
"Whoa, dude, where's my car?"

24
00:01:03,125 --> 00:01:04,858
No, it's not the pot.

25
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:07,294
I've been smoking pot since...

26
00:01:07,296 --> 00:01:09,963
It's... it's not the pot.

27
00:01:09,965 --> 00:01:12,466
I... What did I come
down here for?

28
00:01:17,839 --> 00:01:19,790
Walden!

29
00:01:19,792 --> 00:01:22,259
Hey!

30
00:01:23,011 --> 00:01:24,011
I remember now.

31
00:01:24,013 --> 00:01:25,345

Original Air Date on October 18, 2012

40
00:01:52,204 --> 00:01:56,204
== sync, corrected by elderman ==

41
00:01:57,223 --> 00:01:59,474
Thank you so much
for sending that car for me.

42
00:01:59,476 --> 00:02:02,027
I mean, I felt like a big
ol' movie star at the airport.

43
00:02:02,029 --> 00:02:04,279
The driver held up a sign
with my name on it,

44
00:02:04,281 --> 00:02:07,399
carried my bags, and even gave
me a bottle of what from Fiji.

45
00:02:07,401 --> 00:02:10,068
It probably
wasn't from Fiji...

46
00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:11,570
Would you look at this house?

47
00:02:11,572 --> 00:02:13,522
I mean, right here
on the ocean.

48
00:02:13,524 --> 00:02:15,123
This is like something
you would see in a magazine,

49
00:02:15,125 --> 00:02:16,358
except there would be
famous people

50
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,759
standing here instead of us.

51
00:02:18,494 --> 00:02:20,379
It is so nice to see you.

52
00:02:20,381 --> 00:02:22,147
Well, it is nice
to see you, too. Let me...

53
00:02:22,149 --> 00:02:23,749
Uh, Missi, let me
introduce you to my friend...

54
00:02:23,751 --> 00:02:25,083
Hi, I'm Missi.

55
00:02:25,085 --> 00:02:26,969
Everyone thinks
it's short for Melissa,

56
00:02:26,971 --> 00:02:28,003
but it's actually short
for Mississippi—

57
00:02:28,005 --> 00:02:29,137
the river not the state—

58
00:02:29,139 --> 00:02:30,422
'cause according to my parents,

59
00:02:30,424 --> 00:02:32,057
I was conceived on the deck
of a gambling boat

60
00:02:32,059 --> 00:02:34,760
when my daddy won a $5,000
jackpot on the Caribbean poker.

61
00:02:34,762 --> 00:02:36,845
Wow, that's a...
Have you ever been to the Caribbean?

62
00:02:36,847 --> 00:02:39,047
I went there three years ago
for spring break,

63
00:02:39,049 --> 00:02:41,049
and got stung by a jellyfish.

64
00:02:41,051 --> 00:02:42,684
My friend had to pee on my leg.

65
00:02:43,886 --> 00:02:46,721
Alan.

66
00:02:46,723 --> 00:02:49,608
Uh, it's nice to meet you.
It's nice to meet you, too.

67
00:02:49,610 --> 00:02:51,693
Um, could you direct me
to the little girl's room?

68
00:02:51,695 --> 00:02:53,078
I mean, unless one of y'all

69
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:55,230
have recently been
stung by a jellyfish.

70
00:02:55,232 --> 00:02:56,365
Oh, it's right here.

71
00:02:56,367 --> 00:02:57,749
Thank you.

72
00:02:57,751 --> 00:02:59,734
Wow.

73
00:02:59,736 --> 00:03:01,286
She's a pistol.

74
00:03:01,288 --> 00:03:04,873
More like an AK-47.

75
00:03:04,875 --> 00:03:07,376
So, uh, what's, uh...
what's the story here?

76
00:03:07,378 --> 00:03:08,760
Uh, you and her...?

77
00:03:08,762 --> 00:03:10,712
No. She's my old friend
Jerry's daughter... - Oh.

78
00:03:10,714 --> 00:03:13,081
and she's thinking
about moving here, so I told him

79
00:03:13,083 --> 00:03:16,134
she could stay here for a couple
days, and I'd show her around.

80
00:03:16,136 --> 00:03:18,637
Mm. She's very pretty.

81
00:03:22,058 --> 00:03:23,442
Yeah?

82
00:03:23,444 --> 00:03:25,644
How old do you think she is?

83
00:03:27,064 --> 00:03:29,865
Like, 18 or 19.

84
00:03:29,867 --> 00:03:31,283
Oh, perfect.
You might lose a friend,

85
00:03:31,285 --> 00:03:32,567
but you won't go to jail.

86
00:03:36,105 --> 00:03:39,908
Ow! Hey! Hey, hey, don't hit
me 'cause you can't hit that.

87
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:42,411
Ow!

88
00:03:44,547 --> 00:03:45,914
♪ Men. ♪

89
00:03:45,916 --> 00:03:48,667
Oh, my,

90
00:03:48,669 --> 00:03:50,452
God, the weather
here is amazing.

91
00:03:50,454 --> 00:03:52,838
You know, I could just
lay out in the sun

92
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,756
all day just like
a big ol' lizard.

93
00:03:54,758 --> 00:03:56,842
Back home,
I have to get a spray tan, and

94
00:03:56,844 --> 00:03:58,143
sometimes it comes
out a little orange,

95
00:03:58,145 --> 00:03:59,561
which is totally fine
during Halloween

96
00:03:59,563 --> 00:04:01,129
'cause I can always say
that I'm going as a pumpkin.

97
00:04:01,131 --> 00:04:02,731
Oh, that's interesting.
I love

98
00:04:02,733 --> 00:04:05,150
Halloween. Last year, I went
to this party as a slutty nurse,

99
00:04:05,152 --> 00:04:07,402
and then, the year before that,
I was a slutty cat,

100
00:04:07,404 --> 00:04:09,271
and the year before that,
I was a ladybug.

101
00:04:09,273 --> 00:04:10,472
A slutty ladybug?

102
00:04:10,474 --> 00:04:13,575
What? No!
Why would I be a slutty ladybug?

103
00:04:13,577 --> 00:04:15,610
Oh, I just...

104
00:04:15,612 --> 00:04:17,412
So...
thought since you were...

105
00:04:17,414 --> 00:04:19,147
what's the deal
with this Alan guy anyways?

106
00:04:19,149 --> 00:04:21,783
Oh, we...
Y'all, like, gay for each other or something?

107
00:04:21,785 --> 00:04:23,201
I mean, it's totally fine
if you are.

108
00:04:23,203 --> 00:04:24,786
I have a gay friend.
His name is Russell.

109
00:04:24,788 --> 00:04:27,339
I got him to make out with me
one time, but it didn't take.

110
00:04:27,341 --> 00:04:29,875
No. We... we
are not gay.

111
00:04:29,877 --> 00:04:32,594
We are definitely not gay.

112
00:04:32,596 --> 00:04:34,546
Uh...

113
00:04:34,548 --> 00:04:36,882
So, your dad tells me
that you're, um...

114
00:04:36,884 --> 00:04:38,266
you're thinking
about relocating.

115
00:04:38,268 --> 00:04:39,384
Well, to be honest with you,

116
00:04:39,386 --> 00:04:40,969
I'm not really sure
what I want to do.

117
00:04:40,971 --> 00:04:42,938
You know, I can always keep
working as a dental assistant.

118
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:44,890
You know, that person that sucks
the spit out of your mouth

119
00:04:44,892 --> 00:04:46,224
with that little wetvac
Yes.

120
00:04:46,226 --> 00:04:48,360
and then gives you the free
toothbrush and the lollipop.

121
00:04:48,362 --> 00:04:50,045
You do know
what the lollipop's for, right?

122
00:04:50,047 --> 00:04:52,614
Well, I'm assuming...
Repeat business.

123
00:04:52,616 --> 00:04:54,116
You know,

124
00:04:54,118 --> 00:04:56,318
if it were up to me, I'd just
give them caramel apple

125
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,486
or a little taffy or something.

126
00:04:57,488 --> 00:04:59,070
Pull their teeth right out
of their little heads.

127
00:04:59,072 --> 00:05:01,356
Now, that's how
you make money off children.

128
00:05:01,358 --> 00:05:04,543
Well, that
and baby beauty pageants.

129
00:05:04,545 --> 00:05:06,862
Right.

130
00:05:06,864 --> 00:05:09,231
So, uh...
Do you have a girlfriend?

131
00:05:09,233 --> 00:05:11,216
Uh... no, I do not.

132
00:05:11,218 --> 00:05:13,418
I just went through a breakup.

133
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:15,003
Oh, you poor baby.

134
00:05:15,005 --> 00:05:16,538
I am so sorry.

135
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:18,423
Could you put some
suntan lotion on my back?

136
00:05:18,425 --> 00:05:19,758
Uh, sure.

137
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:22,043
Thanks.

138
00:05:25,515 --> 00:05:27,149
Okay.

139
00:05:27,151 --> 00:05:29,684
Well, don't forget
to rubba-dub-dub.

140
00:05:29,686 --> 00:05:31,019
Rubba-dub-dub?

141
00:05:31,021 --> 00:05:32,554
Yeah, you got to rub it in.

142
00:05:32,556 --> 00:05:33,772
Oh.

143
00:05:33,774 --> 00:05:36,057
Okay.

144
00:05:37,226 --> 00:05:39,427
Would you be offended
if I popped the girls out?

145
00:05:39,429 --> 00:05:40,412
What?

146
00:05:40,414 --> 00:05:41,896
You know, get a little color

147
00:05:41,898 --> 00:05:43,732
on Kim and Khloe.

148
00:05:43,734 --> 00:05:46,384

149
00:05:46,386 --> 00:05:48,587
Oh, yeah, go ahead.

00:05:50,674 --> 00:05:51,739
where you going?

152
00:05:51,741 --> 00:05:53,575
Uh, I just need to do this thing

153
00:05:53,577 --> 00:05:55,093
that I need to do.

154
00:05:57,763 --> 00:06:01,716
Okay. I'll be right here.
Take care.

♪ Men. ♪

156
00:06:03,253 --> 00:06:06,137
You know, I had an electric car,
too, when I was little.

157
00:06:06,139 --> 00:06:07,325
You know, like one of those
little Barbie Jeeps.

158
00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:08,007
Uh-huh.

159
00:06:08,008 --> 00:06:10,709
But this one time, I
left it out in the rain,

160
00:06:10,711 --> 00:06:12,060
so the battery died.
Uh-huh.

161
00:06:12,062 --> 00:06:14,179
So my dad had to drill two
little holes in the floorboard

162
00:06:14,181 --> 00:06:15,263
so I could stick my feet through

163
00:06:15,265 --> 00:06:16,598
and pedal it
just like Fred Flintstone.

164
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,266

you guys been?

Uh, we went...
Walden took me to the Santa Monica Pier.

168
00:06:23,490 --> 00:06:25,106
I actually got one
of those churros.

I used to clean rooms
at the Howard Johnson Hotel.

177
00:06:40,841 --> 00:06:42,123
People are disgusting.

178
00:06:42,125 --> 00:06:43,475
I walked into a bathroom
one time,

179
00:06:43,477 --> 00:06:45,310
and it looked
like a cow had exploded.

180
00:06:46,145 --> 00:06:47,345
Excuse me.

181
00:06:47,347 --> 00:06:49,731
That churro's heading
back to the border.

182
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,601
That, my friends,
is what you get

183
00:06:52,603 --> 00:06:54,469
when hillbillies
have unprotected sex

184
00:06:54,471 --> 00:06:56,638
with hummingbirds.

185
00:07:00,076 --> 00:07:02,077
No. No trouble at all, Jerry.

186
00:07:02,079 --> 00:07:03,328
She's a great kid.

187
00:07:03,330 --> 00:07:05,497
Takes after her old man.

188
00:07:06,699 --> 00:07:08,867
Uh-huh.

189
00:07:09,702 --> 00:07:11,870
Uh-huh.

190
00:07:13,639 --> 00:07:15,823
Uh-huh.

191
00:07:16,926 --> 00:07:19,794
Uh, hey, Jerry, I'm getting
another call. I got...

192
00:07:19,796 --> 00:07:22,063
Uh-huh.

193
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:25,500
Uh-huh.

194
00:07:25,502 --> 00:07:28,853
You know, I love you dearly,
Jerry, but you got to shut up.

195
00:07:31,674 --> 00:07:33,858
Okay, I'll talk to you, buddy.

196
00:07:34,894 --> 00:07:36,728
Yeah?

197
00:07:36,730 --> 00:07:39,180
Hi.

198
00:07:39,182 --> 00:07:41,149
Hey, I just got off the phone
with your dad.

199
00:07:41,151 --> 00:07:43,118
He was just calling to see how...
Oh, Lord,

200
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,369
that man can talk.

201
00:07:44,371 --> 00:07:45,870
I swear, he doesn't even pause
to take a breath.

202
00:07:45,872 --> 00:07:47,038
Do you have a sec?

203
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,540
Uh, sure.

204
00:07:51,378 --> 00:07:53,027
Okay, yeah,
have-have a seat.

205
00:07:53,029 --> 00:07:54,462
Uh...
Wow.

206
00:07:54,464 --> 00:07:56,715
This is a nice bed.

207
00:07:56,717 --> 00:07:58,583
I bet you could do
some serious drilling

208
00:07:58,585 --> 00:08:01,720
on a workbench
like this, huh?

209
00:08:01,722 --> 00:08:05,256
Yeah. So you wanted to
talk to me about something?

210
00:08:05,258 --> 00:08:07,676
Do you remember the last time
that we saw each other?

211
00:08:07,678 --> 00:08:09,227
At dinner?

212
00:08:09,229 --> 00:08:10,345
No, silly. I'm talking about

213
00:08:10,347 --> 00:08:11,879
when I was, like,
eight years old,

214
00:08:11,881 --> 00:08:15,016
and you came to visit us, and
we all went to the state fair.

215
00:08:15,018 --> 00:08:16,718
Okay, I remember that.

216
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,687
Remember you had
to take me and my mom

217
00:08:18,689 --> 00:08:20,021
'cause my dad was working late?

218
00:08:20,023 --> 00:08:22,657
And we ate cotton candy
for dinner, and then you won me

219
00:08:22,659 --> 00:08:24,559
that little stuffed pig
in the squirt-gun horse race?

220
00:08:24,561 --> 00:08:26,494
I used to practice
my kissing on him.

221
00:08:26,496 --> 00:08:29,531
That's a lucky pig.

222
00:08:29,533 --> 00:08:31,950
Eventually, I wore out all
the terry cloth on his snout,

223
00:08:31,952 --> 00:08:34,669
but it was actually okay, 'cause
by that time, I changed over

224
00:08:34,671 --> 00:08:37,622
to real boys, which, turns out
a couple of them were pigs, too.

225
00:08:37,624 --> 00:08:39,124
Yeah, pigs.

226
00:08:39,126 --> 00:08:42,961
Do you want a robe or a blanket
or a suit of armor?

227
00:08:42,963 --> 00:08:44,346
Oh, no, no, no, no.

228
00:08:44,348 --> 00:08:47,015
I'm fine. And remember, I wanted
to go on the tilt-a-whirl,

229
00:08:47,017 --> 00:08:48,433
but my mom was too scared,

230
00:08:48,435 --> 00:08:49,968
so you said you'd sit next
to her, but I wanted you

231
00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:51,436
to sit next to me,
so you sat in between us,

232
00:08:51,438 --> 00:08:52,604
and you held both of our hands?

233
00:08:52,606 --> 00:08:54,305
But actually, you were
the one that got scared

234
00:08:54,307 --> 00:08:55,523
and started praying real loud.

235
00:08:55,525 --> 00:08:57,609
"Oh, Lord,
please get me off this ride!"

236
00:08:57,611 --> 00:09:00,061
I think you even tinkled
a little bit.

237
00:09:00,063 --> 00:09:02,864
Oh, it's a good memory.

238
00:09:02,866 --> 00:09:06,401
I remember 'cause it was one
of the best days ever.

239
00:09:06,403 --> 00:09:08,486
Aw.

240
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:11,740
Are you lonely?

241
00:09:11,742 --> 00:09:16,127
Uh, you know, I-I got Alan.

242
00:09:17,830 --> 00:09:20,582
Yeah, but Alan doesn't
keep you warm at night.

243
00:09:20,584 --> 00:09:22,050
You'd be surprised.

244
00:09:22,052 --> 00:09:24,118
'Cause he, uh...

245
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:26,971
Listen, um, I have this idea.

246
00:09:26,973 --> 00:09:30,508
You know, you might think
that it's kind of crazy.

247
00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:31,976
Okay.

248
00:09:31,978 --> 00:09:35,313
I was just thinking,
you know, since you're single,

249
00:09:35,315 --> 00:09:38,466
and-and you're super hot
and a really nice guy...

250
00:09:38,468 --> 00:09:40,134
Yeah.

251
00:09:40,136 --> 00:09:42,270
That, you know, maybe

252
00:09:42,272 --> 00:09:44,856
you'd like to hook up
with my mom.

253
00:09:51,997 --> 00:09:54,249
What?

254
00:09:54,251 --> 00:09:56,284
She's been all alone
ever since my daddy ran off

255
00:09:56,286 --> 00:09:57,669
with that lady
from the dry cleaners—

256
00:09:57,671 --> 00:09:59,287
you know, the one
with that weird eye

257
00:09:59,289 --> 00:10:00,672
that won't quite open
all the way.

258
00:10:00,674 --> 00:10:02,624
Probably from all
them dry cleaning fumes.

259
00:10:02,626 --> 00:10:03,925
You know, we should have
seen it coming.

260
00:10:03,927 --> 00:10:05,460
She gave him all the clothes
that nobody claimed.

261
00:10:05,462 --> 00:10:06,795
He had, like, four tuxedos.

262
00:10:06,797 --> 00:10:08,546
Wait. Wait.

263
00:10:08,548 --> 00:10:11,015
You want to set me
up with your mom?

264
00:10:11,017 --> 00:10:12,667
She kind of always
had a thing for you,

265
00:10:12,669 --> 00:10:14,269
but she would kill me
if I told you.

266
00:10:14,271 --> 00:10:17,338
Okay, Missi, I don't
think that's a good idea...

267
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:19,474
Just think about it, okay?

268
00:10:19,476 --> 00:10:20,942
Okay.

269
00:10:20,944 --> 00:10:23,177
Great.

270
00:10:23,179 --> 00:10:24,946
Oh, and if it helps at all,

271
00:10:24,948 --> 00:10:26,481
she actually just got
her boobs done.

272
00:10:26,483 --> 00:10:27,949
They actually used mine
as a model.

273
00:10:27,951 --> 00:10:30,151
The doctor even put 'em
in his catalogue— number 244.

274
00:10:30,153 --> 00:10:31,553
Anyone can't get 'em,

275
00:10:31,555 --> 00:10:33,354
but it's kind of weird now
when I walk around town

276
00:10:33,356 --> 00:10:35,657
I just keep thinking
I see my boobs everywhere.

277
00:10:35,659 --> 00:10:37,826
Good night.

278
00:10:41,698 --> 00:10:44,666
Her mom?

279
00:10:46,719 --> 00:10:48,353
When did I
become the guy

280
00:10:48,355 --> 00:10:50,588
that the hot 19-year-old
looks at and goes,

281
00:10:50,590 --> 00:10:53,825
"Hey, you'd be great
for my mom"?

282
00:10:53,827 --> 00:10:55,093
Count your blessings.

283
00:10:55,095 --> 00:10:56,678
One of my patients
tried to set me up

284
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:58,396
with her 70-year-old
grandmother.

285
00:10:58,398 --> 00:10:59,447
No...

286
00:10:59,449 --> 00:11:01,382
Yeah, yeah,
we dated for three months,

287
00:11:01,384 --> 00:11:02,734
and then, um...

288
00:11:02,736 --> 00:11:03,818
one day I showed up

289
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:05,887
and she couldn't remember
who I was.

290
00:11:05,889 --> 00:11:07,489
So we dated another two months.

291
00:11:07,491 --> 00:11:09,223
And, um...

292
00:11:09,225 --> 00:11:10,775
every day was new again

293
00:11:10,777 --> 00:11:13,278
until finally I got tired
of introducing myself.

294
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:14,996
Oh!

295
00:11:14,998 --> 00:11:16,247
But then six months later,

296
00:11:16,249 --> 00:11:18,433
she sent me a ten-dollar check
on my birthday.

297
00:11:19,753 --> 00:11:21,503
Hello?

298
00:11:23,289 --> 00:11:26,073
Jake?

299
00:11:26,075 --> 00:11:28,176
Hey!

300
00:11:28,178 --> 00:11:29,410
What are you
doing here?

301
00:11:29,412 --> 00:11:31,296
I got a weekend pass,
so I took a train in

302
00:11:31,298 --> 00:11:32,413
to surprise you guys.

303
00:11:32,415 --> 00:11:33,715
Hi, soldier!

304
00:11:33,717 --> 00:11:34,849
Hello.

305
00:11:34,851 --> 00:11:36,017
You must be Jake.

306
00:11:36,019 --> 00:11:37,385
I'm sleeping in your room.

307
00:11:37,387 --> 00:11:40,555
Well, God bless America.

308
00:11:41,757 --> 00:11:44,058
♪ Men. ♪

309
00:11:48,323 --> 00:11:50,875
It is so nice to meet you.
I'm Missi.

310
00:11:50,877 --> 00:11:52,393
Short for Mississippi,
not Melissa.

311
00:11:52,395 --> 00:11:54,762
She got stung by
a jellyfish and peed-on.

312
00:11:54,764 --> 00:11:56,263
Thank you.

313
00:11:56,265 --> 00:11:58,933
Are you, like, one of those
Navy SEAL guys?

314
00:11:58,935 --> 00:12:00,267
They are so awesome.

315
00:12:00,269 --> 00:12:01,619
No, I'm just a cook.

316
00:12:01,621 --> 00:12:03,187
Well, that's cool, too.

317
00:12:03,189 --> 00:12:04,838
Without food, everybody dies.

318
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:06,023
That's so...
This one time, I found this

319
00:12:06,025 --> 00:12:07,625
little baby bird
that fell out of a tree

320
00:12:07,627 --> 00:12:09,860
and landed in my backyard
and he was almost dead.

321
00:12:09,862 --> 00:12:11,612
So I started feeding him
with this little eyedropper

322
00:12:11,614 --> 00:12:14,482
full of warm milk. "Eat
little bird, eat little bird."

323
00:12:14,484 --> 00:12:16,033
And eat he did.
Within a week,

324
00:12:16,035 --> 00:12:18,736
I was chewing up crackers and
spitting 'em right in his mouth.

325
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:20,871
And when he finally had enough
strength to fly on his own,

326
00:12:20,873 --> 00:12:22,656
I opened up that box
and set him free.

327
00:12:22,658 --> 00:12:23,958
No kidding.
It was one

328
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:26,076
of the most beautiful things
I had ever seen.

329
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:28,379
But he got about ten feet up
in the air

330
00:12:28,381 --> 00:12:30,364
before my cat launched himself
off that picnic table

331
00:12:30,366 --> 00:12:31,382
and caught him right in midair.

332
00:12:31,384 --> 00:12:32,833
I mean, he didn't even
have to chew—

333
00:12:32,835 --> 00:12:34,535
just one gulp
and that bird was gone.

334
00:12:34,537 --> 00:12:37,371
But... I didn't have to
feed Mr. Mittens that day.

335
00:12:37,373 --> 00:12:39,723
So I know how important food is.

336
00:12:40,592 --> 00:12:42,376
Thanks. Uh, if you're hungry,

337
00:12:42,378 --> 00:12:43,761
I could...
I would love something to eat!

338
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:45,729
Oh. Okay.

339
00:12:47,382 --> 00:12:48,766
All right,
well, uh...

340
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:50,234
welcome back!

341
00:12:51,069 --> 00:12:53,053
Good catching up.

342
00:12:53,055 --> 00:12:54,355
That was like

343
00:12:54,357 --> 00:12:57,441
being there the first time
Beavis met Butthead.

344
00:12:57,443 --> 00:13:00,444
Wait till Beavis sees Butthead
in a bikini.

345
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:04,365
God. You remember falling
that hard and fast for a girl?

346
00:13:04,367 --> 00:13:06,000
I remember the fast part.

347
00:13:06,002 --> 00:13:08,669
Kind of a relief those
days are behind us, huh?

348
00:13:08,671 --> 00:13:10,704
Behind you.

349
00:13:10,706 --> 00:13:12,456
These are my days.

350
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:15,292
Oh, no, I wasn't saying...
No, I am young, Alan.

351
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:16,760
I am young!

352
00:13:16,762 --> 00:13:18,412
Fine, fine, you're young.

353
00:13:18,414 --> 00:13:19,880
Where you going?

354
00:13:20,882 --> 00:13:24,084
I don't remember.

355
00:13:27,339 --> 00:13:29,890
Mmm. Kid makes
good chili.

356
00:13:29,892 --> 00:13:31,525
Glad you like it.

357
00:13:31,527 --> 00:13:33,260
We have enough...

358
00:13:33,262 --> 00:13:35,429
for a month.

359
00:13:36,448 --> 00:13:37,982
Why?

360
00:13:37,984 --> 00:13:39,533
The recipe was
for a platoon,

361
00:13:39,535 --> 00:13:42,653
and math is not his strong suit.

362
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:44,788
Where'd he take "Oh, my God,
this place is beautiful.

363
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:47,241
"Does that ocean go all the way
to Hawaii? I love Hawaii.

364
00:13:47,243 --> 00:13:50,160
You know 'aloha' means
'hello' and 'good-bye'"?

365
00:13:50,962 --> 00:13:52,630
They went for a walk
on the beach,

366
00:13:52,632 --> 00:13:54,215
which, you know,
has more grains of sand

367
00:13:54,217 --> 00:13:55,782
than there are stars
in the entire Milky Way.

368
00:13:55,784 --> 00:13:57,618
Speaking of which, do you like
Snickers or Milky Way?

369
00:13:57,620 --> 00:13:59,053
I like Three Musketeers.

370
00:14:00,255 --> 00:14:02,256
Even though I don't know
what nougat is.

371
00:14:06,394 --> 00:14:07,333
Hey, what you doing?

372
00:14:07,358 --> 00:14:08,939
Missi and I are hanging out
on the beach.

373
00:14:09,298 --> 00:14:11,015
Am I gonna see you at all
while you're home?

374
00:14:11,017 --> 00:14:13,267
Oh, uh-huh, yeah, sure.

375
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:15,185
You're never gonna see him.

376
00:14:15,187 --> 00:14:16,320
Hey, Missi told me

377
00:14:16,322 --> 00:14:17,988
she's trying to set you up
with her mom.

378
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:19,139
How cool would that be?

379
00:14:19,141 --> 00:14:21,158
If you married her mom
and I married Missi,

380
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:22,676
you'd be my stepdad.

381
00:14:22,678 --> 00:14:24,528
Yeah, really cool.

382
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:26,747
All right. See you later, Dad.

383
00:14:26,749 --> 00:14:28,916
And Dad.

384
00:14:30,818 --> 00:14:33,287
You know, if they have kids,
we'd be their grandpappies.

385
00:14:33,289 --> 00:14:35,489
Ow!

386
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:39,660
Well, to make
a long story short,

387
00:14:39,662 --> 00:14:41,378
I ate all the wafers,
which is why

388
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:43,664
you should never smoke pot
before you go to church.

389
00:14:43,666 --> 00:14:46,133
That's funny. This one
time, me and my friend...

390
00:14:46,135 --> 00:14:47,968
Do you want
to hear a joke?

391
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:48,936
Sure.

392
00:14:48,938 --> 00:14:51,138
What do gay horse eat?
What?

393
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:52,940
Haaaaay!

394
00:14:52,942 --> 00:14:55,059
Can I ask you something?

395
00:14:55,061 --> 00:14:56,894
Any...
Do you think I talk too much?

396
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:58,896
No, I love listening
to you talk.

397
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:00,781
I mean, it's funny. Normally...
You are just

398
00:15:00,783 --> 00:15:01,782
so sweet.

399
00:15:01,784 --> 00:15:03,200
I swear I could
just eat you up,

400
00:15:03,202 --> 00:15:04,785
but, you know, then I'd
probably get a sugar rush,

401
00:15:04,787 --> 00:15:06,153
'cause you are just so sweet,
and if you think

402
00:15:06,155 --> 00:15:08,572
I talk a lot now, you should
really hear me after I...

403
00:15:10,292 --> 00:15:11,792
Well, I am definitely
gonna shut up now,

404
00:15:11,794 --> 00:15:12,910
'cause you're
a really good kisser,

405
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:14,328
and the last thing
I want to do is...

406
00:15:20,503 --> 00:15:22,636
Look at you
making breakfast.

407
00:15:22,638 --> 00:15:23,921
It's what the army
trains you to do

408
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:26,307
when you keep
dropping a loaded gun.

409
00:15:26,309 --> 00:15:27,925
Here, have a cup of coffee.

410
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:28,809
Oh, thank you.

411
00:15:28,811 --> 00:15:30,594
You want to hear a joke?
Sure.

412
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:31,929
What do gay horses eat?

413
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:32,563
Mm...

414
00:15:32,565 --> 00:15:34,098
Hay.

415
00:15:45,527 --> 00:15:48,195
So, uh, when do you leave
for the base?

416
00:15:48,197 --> 00:15:49,947
Oh, my train leaves at 4:00.

417
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:52,065
Mm. I'll give you a ride
to the station.

418
00:15:52,067 --> 00:15:53,200
Thanks.

419
00:15:53,202 --> 00:15:54,668
Are you kidding?
It's the only time

420
00:15:54,670 --> 00:15:56,170
I'm gonna get
to spend with you.

421
00:15:56,172 --> 00:15:58,372
So, uh, how was sleeping
on that couch last night?

422
00:15:59,407 --> 00:16:02,376
Oh, you know, it was
a little lumpy, but...

423
00:16:02,378 --> 00:16:04,294
better than sleeping
with 60 guys

424
00:16:04,296 --> 00:16:08,298
coughing, farting, and getting
all romantic with themselves.

425
00:16:09,134 --> 00:16:11,084
Missi still sleeping?

426
00:16:11,086 --> 00:16:13,187
No, she's in the shower.

427
00:16:16,441 --> 00:16:18,392
Oops.

428
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:20,394
No, it's fine.

429
00:16:20,396 --> 00:16:22,279
Sh-She seems
like a nice girl.

430
00:16:22,281 --> 00:16:23,897
You have no idea.

431
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:27,534
Well, if you'll
excuse me,

432
00:16:27,536 --> 00:16:29,553
I'm gonna take her some breakfast.
Mm.

433
00:16:29,555 --> 00:16:32,656
As you can imagine,
we worked up quite the appetite.

434
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:33,957
Right.

435
00:16:36,628 --> 00:16:39,079
And... when I say
"worked up an appetite,"

436
00:16:39,081 --> 00:16:42,299
you understand...
I got it, I got it.

437
00:16:44,335 --> 00:16:47,805
I really loved hanging out
with you this weekend.

438
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:50,808
Cool.

439
00:16:50,810 --> 00:16:52,393
Uh... yeah.

440
00:16:52,395 --> 00:16:54,762
So, listen, I get another pass
in, like, a month,

441
00:16:54,764 --> 00:16:56,597
so maybe we can see
each other then.

442
00:16:56,599 --> 00:16:58,432
Maybe.

443
00:16:58,434 --> 00:17:00,467
Are... you feeling all right?

444
00:17:00,469 --> 00:17:01,802
You're awful quiet.

445
00:17:01,804 --> 00:17:04,605
Well, here's the thing, Jake.

446
00:17:04,607 --> 00:17:07,691
Hang on, Dad!
There's a thing!

447
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:09,076
What's the thing?

448
00:17:09,911 --> 00:17:11,862
I sort of have a boyfriend.

449
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:13,330
A boyfriend?

450
00:17:13,332 --> 00:17:15,249
Well, technically we broke up

451
00:17:15,251 --> 00:17:16,417
because I was tired of him

452
00:17:16,419 --> 00:17:17,701
always putting his career
ahead of me.

453
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:18,869
He's a doctor.

454
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:21,004
Well, not a real doctor,
a glass doctor.

455
00:17:21,006 --> 00:17:22,823
You know, like if you get
a crack in your windshield,

456
00:17:22,825 --> 00:17:24,425
he will come right
to your driveway and fix it

457
00:17:24,427 --> 00:17:25,926
in less than half an hour,
guaranteed.

458
00:17:25,928 --> 00:17:27,177
So...

459
00:17:27,179 --> 00:17:28,995
Anyway, he sent me
this e-mail this morning

460
00:17:28,997 --> 00:17:31,348
saying that he wants
to try things again, but...

461
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:33,934
now I really like you.
It's just that...

462
00:17:33,936 --> 00:17:36,553
Zach and I have been together
for, like, six months,

463
00:17:36,555 --> 00:17:38,605
and we even went
to a wedding together.

464
00:17:38,607 --> 00:17:40,691
I can't just throw that away.

465
00:17:41,526 --> 00:17:43,644
But, I thought you...

466
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:46,480
Good-bye, Jake.

467
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:50,984
Don't be a hero.

468
00:17:56,324 --> 00:17:58,859
What the hell just happened?

469
00:17:58,861 --> 00:18:00,794
♪ Men. ♪

470
00:18:05,733 --> 00:18:08,285
You and Missi make plans
to see each other again?

471
00:18:08,287 --> 00:18:10,020
No.

472
00:18:10,022 --> 00:18:11,755
Why? I-I thought
you two were, uh...

473
00:18:11,757 --> 00:18:14,190
I thought so, too.

474
00:18:14,192 --> 00:18:16,376
Oh.

475
00:18:18,329 --> 00:18:19,696
If it helps...

476
00:18:19,698 --> 00:18:21,865
It doesn't.

477
00:18:22,717 --> 00:18:24,918
Okay. Okay.

478
00:18:27,255 --> 00:18:28,805
I remember
my first...

479
00:18:28,807 --> 00:18:30,474
Dad.

480
00:18:30,476 --> 00:18:32,676
Gotcha.

481
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:38,065
Does it get any easier?

482
00:18:38,067 --> 00:18:39,650
Oh, God, no.

483
00:18:39,652 --> 00:18:42,819
But... the human mind
is a wonderful thing.

484
00:18:42,821 --> 00:18:44,988
It forgets pain, so you can...

485
00:18:44,990 --> 00:18:47,858
go out and get some more.

486
00:18:48,693 --> 00:18:50,560
She has a boyfriend
back home.

487
00:18:50,562 --> 00:18:53,229
A doctor.

488
00:18:53,231 --> 00:18:56,033
How am I supposed
to compete with that?

489
00:18:56,035 --> 00:18:58,168
Let me ask you something, Jake.

490
00:18:58,170 --> 00:19:00,003
Knowing what you know now,

491
00:19:00,005 --> 00:19:01,922
and feeling how you feel now,

492
00:19:01,924 --> 00:19:04,174
would you have done anything
differently?

493
00:19:05,009 --> 00:19:06,293
No.

494
00:19:06,295 --> 00:19:09,129
I just would've done it
a few more times.

495
00:19:09,964 --> 00:19:12,215
There you go.

496
00:19:12,217 --> 00:19:14,468
That's what
love's all about.

497
00:19:18,089 --> 00:19:19,272
Hey.

498
00:19:19,274 --> 00:19:20,943
So, I just got off
the phone with my mom.

499
00:19:20,968 --> 00:19:22,110
Oh, yeah?

500
00:19:22,111 --> 00:19:24,695
She's really looking forward
to hearing from you.

501
00:19:26,148 --> 00:19:28,231
Gee, I-I don't know, Missi.

502
00:19:28,233 --> 00:19:30,233
I'm... I'm not sure
it's a good idea.

503
00:19:30,235 --> 00:19:32,903
I mean, I know your mom and dad
aren't together anymore,

504
00:19:32,905 --> 00:19:34,771
but your dad's an
old friend and...

505
00:19:34,773 --> 00:19:36,456
Here's a recent
picture of her.

506
00:19:41,329 --> 00:19:44,247
Then again, I haven't
seen him in years. I...

507
00:19:44,249 --> 00:19:46,466
Great. I'll go tell her
that you're gonna call.

508
00:19:46,468 --> 00:19:48,617
Hey, wait. Wait
a second. I...

509
00:19:48,619 --> 00:19:50,136
Yeah?

510
00:19:50,138 --> 00:19:53,840
I'm flattered that you think
I'd be good for your mom,

511
00:19:53,842 --> 00:19:55,624
but I was just curious

512
00:19:55,626 --> 00:19:59,896
at any point in time,
did you think that...

513
00:19:59,898 --> 00:20:02,231
maybe you and me...?

514
00:20:02,233 --> 00:20:03,649
Ew.

515
00:20:08,305 --> 00:20:09,822
A simple "no" would suffice.

516
