1
00:00:05,405 --> 00:00:06,284
I feel like I spent

2
00:00:06,302 --> 00:00:09,261
the last half hour
yodeling in a cave.

3
00:00:10,481 --> 00:00:12,847
I'm sorry.
It wasn't you.

4
00:00:12,878 --> 00:00:14,939
No, it was, it was
like licking a lollipop

5
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:16,592
that never gets
any smaller.

6
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:18,257
I mean, you enjoy it,

7
00:00:18,278 --> 00:00:20,861
but after a while you
start to crave the stick.

8
00:00:20,901 --> 00:00:23,051
Did I at least make
you crave the stick?

9
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:26,409
You did great.
I'm just...

10
00:00:26,436 --> 00:00:28,129
a little distracted.

11
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:29,850
Is everything okay?

12
00:00:29,877 --> 00:00:32,474
Not really.
We need to talk.

13
00:00:32,502 --> 00:00:35,044
Come on. I got lockjaw
and you want to talk?

14
00:00:35,063 --> 00:00:37,498
I want to know where we're
going with this relationship.

15
00:00:37,518 --> 00:00:38,831
Do we have
any kind of future?

16
00:00:38,852 --> 00:00:41,260
Of course we do.
Things are good.

17
00:00:41,325 --> 00:00:43,727
Things are great.
Why rock the boat?

18
00:00:43,754 --> 00:00:45,920
I mean, I know the little
man inside your boat

19
00:00:45,952 --> 00:00:47,837
could use some rocking.

20
00:00:47,864 --> 00:00:49,511
I'm talking about making

21
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:51,412
a long-term commitment
to each other.

22
00:00:51,432 --> 00:00:52,793
You mean like marriage?

23
00:00:52,812 --> 00:00:54,109
Would that be so awful?

24
00:00:54,133 --> 00:00:55,444
Ask my ex-wife.

25
00:00:55,461 --> 00:00:57,914
Her statement in court read
like a Stephen King novel.

26
00:00:57,937 --> 00:01:00,095
Where is this coming
from all of a sudden?

27
00:01:00,131 --> 00:01:02,081
It was something
my gynecologist said.

28
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:03,979
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.

29
00:01:03,999 --> 00:01:06,322
He said, "Everything looks
great down here.

30
00:01:06,353 --> 00:01:08,624
Would you like to
have dinner sometime?"

31
00:01:08,866 --> 00:01:12,868
Wow. Wow. That is
wildly inappropriate.

32
00:01:12,887 --> 00:01:15,254
- I mean, as a doctor myself...
- You're a chiropractor.

33
00:01:15,271 --> 00:01:17,057
Nonetheless,
I am a healer.

34
00:01:17,135 --> 00:01:18,620
There's a code!

35
00:01:18,645 --> 00:01:20,056
I mean, you don't
ask someone out

36
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:22,193
when they're buck naked with
their feet in the stirrups.

37
00:01:22,207 --> 00:01:24,103
Unless you're drunk
at a rodeo.

38
00:01:24,736 --> 00:01:26,102
Well, he did.

39
00:01:26,115 --> 00:01:28,117
Do you want to go
out with him?

40
00:01:28,133 --> 00:01:30,166
It's not about
going out with him.

41
00:01:30,184 --> 00:01:32,087
But if you and I
don't have a future,

42
00:01:32,106 --> 00:01:33,912
I need to examine
my options.

43
00:01:33,925 --> 00:01:36,896
The way you got examined
by Dr. Busyfingers?

44
00:01:37,895 --> 00:01:41,277
Look, I don't want
to grow old alone.

45
00:01:41,314 --> 00:01:44,360
So, if you're not ready to make
this kind of commitment,

46
00:01:44,416 --> 00:01:45,927
better to know now.

47
00:01:45,953 --> 00:01:48,754
Geez, Lyndsey, you
kinda sprung this on me.

48
00:01:48,791 --> 00:01:51,718
I mean, I don't have to give you
an answer just this second, do I?

49
00:01:51,741 --> 00:01:54,226
No, no, of course not.
Just think about it.

50
00:01:54,258 --> 00:01:55,257
Okay.

51
00:01:55,319 --> 00:01:56,401
Good night.

52
00:01:56,417 --> 00:01:57,719
Good night.

53
00:02:03,289 --> 00:02:04,395
And just for the record,

54
00:02:04,413 --> 00:02:05,735
he gets paid to
go down there.

55
00:02:05,747 --> 00:02:07,463
I do it for the
love of the game.

Oh, hey, can I borrow your car?

60
00:02:22,741 --> 00:02:25,180
I need to take my bike into the

Sure. No problem.

62
00:02:26,564 --> 00:02:27,448
Thanks.

63
00:02:27,469 --> 00:02:29,185
I assume it needs gas?

So, uh, what are
you reading?

68
00:02:38,248 --> 00:02:39,707

73
00:02:47,428 --> 00:02:48,532
Impressive.

74
00:02:48,542 --> 00:02:51,170
I'm still on the first
Tuesday with Morrie.

75
00:02:51,277 --> 00:02:53,345
He dies in the end.

76
00:02:53,507 --> 00:02:55,129
Thank you.

77
00:02:55,165 --> 00:02:57,864
So, listen, I want to ask your
opinion about something.

78
00:02:57,902 --> 00:02:59,878
Lyndsey has been pushing me
to make a commitment

79
00:02:59,903 --> 00:03:01,870
'cause some other guy
asked her out.

80
00:03:01,893 --> 00:03:04,744
- Who asked her out?
- Her gynecologist.

81
00:03:04,782 --> 00:03:07,766
Well, at least he knows
what he's getting into.

82
00:03:11,416 --> 00:03:14,768
Cute. I mean,
don't want to lose Lyndsey,

83
00:03:14,813 --> 00:03:16,957
but I'm just not ready
to make a commitment.

84
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:19,430
Well, my advice is you better do
something soon,

85
00:03:19,453 --> 00:03:21,399
or you're out
and the doctor's in.

86
00:03:21,424 --> 00:03:23,704
And when I say,
"The doctor's in," I mean...

87
00:03:23,734 --> 00:03:25,858
No, I got it, I got it.

88
00:03:25,898 --> 00:03:27,387
All right, I got
to get out of here.

89
00:03:27,421 --> 00:03:28,920
Oh, here you go.

90
00:03:28,944 --> 00:03:31,492
Oh, uh, the driver's side door
doesn't work anymore,

91
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:33,005
so either get in
the passenger side

92
00:03:33,045 --> 00:03:35,120
or climb in through the window.

93
00:03:35,483 --> 00:03:36,540
Got it.

94
00:03:36,570 --> 00:03:38,585
Oh, and whatever you do, when
you put the key in the ignition,

95
00:03:38,613 --> 00:03:41,026
make sure you're
holding something rubber.

96
00:03:41,225 --> 00:03:44,063

so you're grounded.

Can I give you a ride

Yeah, it's actually,
it's not mine.

115
00:05:04,814 --> 00:05:07,377
I borrowed it from a friend
to get my bike fixed.

116
00:05:07,410 --> 00:05:09,043
You ride a bike around town.

00:05:09,072 --> 00:05:11,572
You must have
amazing stamina.

118
00:05:12,728 --> 00:05:14,996
Well, it's not the only way
that I get around.

to be ashamed about.

being what it is,

121
00:05:18,808 --> 00:05:21,108

I'm-I'm not ashamed.

123
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:26,102
Trust me, there will come a day
when you won't have

124
00:05:26,117 --> 00:05:28,494
to worry about having enough
money for gas.

125
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,680
Okay.

126
00:05:31,624 --> 00:05:33,875
I look forward to that day.

127
00:05:35,097 --> 00:05:37,055

Los Angeles, Walden?

131

You trying to be an actor

132
00:05:48,566 --> 00:05:52,760

134
00:05:55,173 --> 00:05:57,040

135
00:05:57,263 --> 00:05:59,409

Yes. Yes, I am.

137
00:06:03,695 --> 00:06:07,177

You are a writer.

Listen, what do you say we
go grab a bite to eat,

142
00:06:16,412 --> 00:06:18,391
get the car fixed later?

143
00:06:18,632 --> 00:06:21,783

great deli right up here.

145
00:06:24,533 --> 00:06:26,517
- Where's that?
- My house.

00:06:26,567 --> 00:06:29,754
Oh. What's on the menu there?

147
00:06:31,863 --> 00:06:33,640
Oh.

148
00:06:34,781 --> 00:06:36,602

151
00:06:43,085 --> 00:06:44,904

Nothing much.

153
00:06:46,292 --> 00:06:48,196
How about we go out to a movie?

154
00:06:48,217 --> 00:06:49,523
Sure, we could do that.

155
00:06:49,543 --> 00:06:52,306

Yeah?

157
00:06:54,324 --> 00:06:56,692
Did you think about what we
discussed last night?

158
00:06:56,730 --> 00:06:57,989
Oh, yes, oh, yes.

159
00:06:58,003 --> 00:07:00,036
Thinking about it constantly.

160
00:07:00,058 --> 00:07:02,025
Anything you want to talk about?

161
00:07:02,047 --> 00:07:03,691
Not yet.

162
00:07:03,847 --> 00:07:05,941
Still thinking.
You know...

163
00:07:05,961 --> 00:07:08,220
percolating,
uh, mulling.

164
00:07:08,241 --> 00:07:10,572
All the pertinent "ings."

165
00:07:11,496 --> 00:07:12,584
Ooh!

166
00:07:12,614 --> 00:07:14,681
Cogitating!

167
00:07:14,814 --> 00:07:17,143
Stalling, avoiding, ducking.

168
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:19,016
Ooh! Procrastinating.

169
00:07:19,049 --> 00:07:21,688

That's-that's crazy.

170
00:07:21,709 --> 00:07:23,575
I'm not doing any
of those things.

171
00:07:23,595 --> 00:07:25,343
I mean, why would I do
those things?

172
00:07:25,362 --> 00:07:27,365
So what movie would you
like to see?

173
00:07:27,564 --> 00:07:29,060

175

I just don't understand

176
00:07:31,722 --> 00:07:33,552
why we can't keep things
the way they are.

177
00:07:33,566 --> 00:07:35,130
You mean, living day-to-day,

178
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:37,252
never knowing what kind of
future you have with the person

179
00:07:37,275 --> 00:07:39,609
you've been in a relationship
with the past three years?

180
00:07:39,634 --> 00:07:42,823
I prefer to think of it
as cherishing each day,

181
00:07:42,849 --> 00:07:45,907
nay each moment,
with the woman I love

182
00:07:45,947 --> 00:07:48,565
because none of us knows
how much time we have left.

183
00:07:48,586 --> 00:07:52,188
I mean, it could all disappear
in the blink of an eye.

184
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:54,319
You mean like this?

185
00:07:56,525 --> 00:07:58,080
Exactly.

186
00:08:00,627 --> 00:08:02,611
Well, it would appear
that a bicycle's

187
00:08:02,630 --> 00:08:05,006
not the only thing
you can ride.

188
00:08:05,424 --> 00:08:08,761
I'm also good with bulls
and merry-go-rounds.

189
00:08:09,212 --> 00:08:11,640
So, did you enjoy
your lunch?

190
00:08:11,752 --> 00:08:13,325
Oh, yeah.

191
00:08:13,349 --> 00:08:15,649
I would definitely
eat here again.

192
00:08:17,947 --> 00:08:19,580
Mm, mm.

193
00:08:21,709 --> 00:08:24,027
Do you mind
taking a taxi home?

194
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:27,763
Uh, sure, no problem.

195
00:08:27,793 --> 00:08:30,657
I'd drive you, I just
have some things to do.

196
00:08:31,764 --> 00:08:32,976
Okay.

197
00:08:33,028 --> 00:08:35,862
So... then we're done here?

198
00:08:36,494 --> 00:08:38,427
I am.

199
00:08:39,685 --> 00:08:41,433
Okay.

200
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:47,064
You know, uh,
we should do this again.

201
00:08:47,083 --> 00:08:49,305
Oh, we will.
I'll let you know when.

202
00:08:50,748 --> 00:08:51,999
All righty.

203
00:08:52,026 --> 00:08:53,956
Oh, here.

204
00:08:56,186 --> 00:08:57,587
What's this?

205
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:59,119
It's money for a taxi.

206
00:08:59,135 --> 00:09:00,173
I don't need that.

207
00:09:00,198 --> 00:09:03,065
Sweetie, don't be proud.
Take the money.

208
00:09:05,972 --> 00:09:08,106
Okay, great.

209
00:09:09,389 --> 00:09:10,589
Thank you.

210
00:09:18,009 --> 00:09:19,013
Hey, hey!

211
00:09:19,059 --> 00:09:21,475
Hey. Where've you been?

212
00:09:22,318 --> 00:09:25,401
I got some good news
and I got some bad news for ya.

213
00:09:25,444 --> 00:09:26,789
What's the bad news?

214
00:09:26,834 --> 00:09:28,845
Your car overheated
and broke down.

215
00:09:28,896 --> 00:09:31,946
Ah, I should have told you
not to turn on the radio.

216
00:09:33,688 --> 00:09:35,622
So, uh, what's the good news?

217
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:37,551
This beautiful woman pulls up

218
00:09:37,565 --> 00:09:39,932
in a Bentley and offers me help,

219
00:09:39,946 --> 00:09:41,645
and then she takes me back
to her house

220
00:09:41,671 --> 00:09:44,002
and bangs my brains out.

221
00:09:44,138 --> 00:09:46,015
How is that good news for me?

222
00:09:46,045 --> 00:09:47,310
Oh, sorry, I misspoke.

223
00:09:47,349 --> 00:09:50,329
The bad news was for you,
the good news was for me.

224
00:09:50,355 --> 00:09:51,650
Do you have any idea
how many times

225
00:09:51,679 --> 00:09:54,066
I've been stranded by the side
of the road 'cause of that car?

226
00:09:54,097 --> 00:09:55,730
The only person who's ever
stopped was a truck driver

227
00:09:55,757 --> 00:09:58,124
with no pants
and drawn-on eyebrows.

228
00:09:58,223 --> 00:10:00,028
She also gave me money
for a taxi.

229
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:02,799
- I hate you!
- I know, right?

230
00:10:02,925 --> 00:10:04,224
How was your day?

231
00:10:04,238 --> 00:10:06,590
I'm pretty sure
Lyndsey and I broke up.

232
00:10:06,857 --> 00:10:09,821
Oh, man, I'm sorry.

233
00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:12,175
I really liked Lyndsey.
I thought she was great.

234
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:14,691
Yeah, well, she is great,
but I'm not gonna be bullied

235
00:10:14,728 --> 00:10:17,496
into spending the rest of my life
with somebody just 'cause they're great.

236
00:10:17,544 --> 00:10:20,805
Who would? It's like being
forced to win the lotto.

237
00:10:22,046 --> 00:10:23,991
Wait a minute.
If you took a cab home,

238
00:10:24,030 --> 00:10:25,981
where's my car?

239
00:10:27,088 --> 00:10:28,722
Huh.

240
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:32,565
Here's a hundred bucks.
Buy a better car.

241
00:10:38,017 --> 00:10:39,885
So, you ready
for round two?

242
00:10:39,950 --> 00:10:42,261
Oh, right now?

243
00:10:42,543 --> 00:10:46,617
Could we just talk a little while

244
00:10:46,696 --> 00:10:50,194
the boys, you know,
restock the shelves?

245
00:10:50,742 --> 00:10:53,306
Yeah, sure, let's talk.

246
00:10:53,395 --> 00:10:57,746
Um, how are things
going with your book?

247
00:10:57,893 --> 00:11:00,250
How's... with the what?

248
00:11:00,437 --> 00:11:01,609
Your book.

249
00:11:01,642 --> 00:11:03,337
The one you're
trying to finish?

250
00:11:03,373 --> 00:11:05,407
Oh, my... the book.

251
00:11:06,189 --> 00:11:07,908
Good.

252
00:11:08,165 --> 00:11:09,631
It's good.

253
00:11:09,656 --> 00:11:11,915
It's going good.

254
00:11:12,464 --> 00:11:14,971
Writing words.

255
00:11:15,733 --> 00:11:17,900
Making sentences.

256
00:11:18,551 --> 00:11:20,029
What's it about?

257
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:22,906
Okay, um... yeah.
It's about this, uh...

258
00:11:22,965 --> 00:11:26,801
guy named Alan.

259
00:11:27,067 --> 00:11:29,167
Mm-hmm.

260
00:11:29,226 --> 00:11:31,527
He... and he lives
with his brother

261
00:11:31,592 --> 00:11:36,194
in this, uh, fabulous
Malibu beach house.

262
00:11:36,951 --> 00:11:38,946
And?

263
00:11:39,869 --> 00:11:43,640
And... the brother dies.

264
00:11:43,799 --> 00:11:47,461
He falls in front
of a train in Paris.

265
00:11:47,868 --> 00:11:49,968
Wow.
Didn't see that coming.

266
00:11:51,729 --> 00:11:53,897
Neither did he.

267
00:11:57,332 --> 00:12:01,934
Anyway, this, uh, this
billionaire named Wal... ter...

268
00:12:02,945 --> 00:12:06,579
comes along and
he buys the house,

269
00:12:06,643 --> 00:12:10,246
and then, and Alan
continues to live there.

270
00:12:10,296 --> 00:12:12,503
Wait. With a
complete stranger?

271
00:12:12,551 --> 00:12:14,047
Yeah.

272
00:12:14,635 --> 00:12:16,301
Are they gay?

273
00:12:16,352 --> 00:12:18,552
No. No, no.

274
00:12:18,809 --> 00:12:21,358
No, they're just...
they're just friends.

275
00:12:21,396 --> 00:12:23,741
That's a bit far-fetched,
isn't it?

276
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:25,825
What? No.

277
00:12:25,863 --> 00:12:28,137
That's totally plausible.

278
00:12:29,382 --> 00:12:32,491
They have these...
adventures together.

279
00:12:34,255 --> 00:12:36,289
It's funny.

280
00:12:38,405 --> 00:12:40,941
It's a good thing
you're pretty.

281
00:12:48,391 --> 00:12:49,591
Hey.

282
00:12:50,419 --> 00:12:52,195
Whoa.

283
00:12:53,996 --> 00:12:56,449
Look at you.
Bought some new clothes, huh?

284
00:12:56,510 --> 00:12:57,978
Nope.

285
00:12:58,053 --> 00:13:00,383
Somebody bought new clothes
for me.

286
00:13:01,221 --> 00:13:04,703
Shari took her boy toy
shopping in Beverly Hills.

287
00:13:04,742 --> 00:13:08,009
I felt like Julia Roberts
in Pretty Woman.

288
00:13:10,539 --> 00:13:12,674
The only thing I got
from the truck driver

289
00:13:12,701 --> 00:13:15,391
was a pack of cigarettes
and an eyebrow pencil.

290
00:13:15,746 --> 00:13:17,312
Yeah, I gotta tell you,

291
00:13:17,339 --> 00:13:20,041
it is nice to be taken
care of for a change. Well...

292
00:13:20,091 --> 00:13:22,560
Look who I'm talkin' to.

293
00:13:22,699 --> 00:13:25,811
All right, I'm gonna go
do some manscaping.

294
00:13:25,869 --> 00:13:28,556
Mama like me smooth.

295
00:13:30,608 --> 00:13:32,032
Oh, hey, buddy.

296
00:13:32,083 --> 00:13:34,503
Hey, Dad.
Well, this is a nice surprise.

297
00:13:34,528 --> 00:13:35,827
What's going on?

298
00:13:35,841 --> 00:13:37,909
Well, I heard from Eldridge
that you and his mom broke up,

299
00:13:37,925 --> 00:13:39,673
so I'm just checking in
to see how you're doing.

300
00:13:39,709 --> 00:13:41,606
That is really sweet
of you, Jake,

301
00:13:41,635 --> 00:13:43,201
to be concerned
about your old man.

302
00:13:43,215 --> 00:13:45,887
Well, I love you, Dad.
I want you to be happy.

303
00:13:45,911 --> 00:13:47,314
Thank you.

304
00:13:47,351 --> 00:13:48,751
And, you know, you've always
been there for me.

305
00:13:48,777 --> 00:13:50,510
Now I get to be here for you.

306
00:13:50,536 --> 00:13:52,382
That's true.

307
00:13:52,403 --> 00:13:55,173
- Speaking of which...
- How much?

308
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:57,370
A couple hundred bucks would
make it a Merry Christmas

309
00:13:57,398 --> 00:13:58,929
for all the people I love.

310
00:13:58,976 --> 00:14:00,678
All right, Jake,
I'll take care of it.

311
00:14:00,692 --> 00:14:02,801
Oh, thank you, Dad.
Love you, bye.

312
00:14:02,844 --> 00:14:03,994
Bye.

313
00:14:04,026 --> 00:14:07,530
Totally worked!
We're going to Tijuana!

314
00:14:11,718 --> 00:14:14,914
Totally worked.
He thinks I'm sending him money.

315
00:14:18,270 --> 00:14:20,824
Um. Excuse me.
Is this seat taken?

316
00:14:20,851 --> 00:14:22,250
Sit.

317
00:14:22,277 --> 00:14:23,676
But if a lady comes along,

318
00:14:23,739 --> 00:14:27,090
I'm gonna have
to ask you to vacate.

319
00:14:27,159 --> 00:14:29,125
Right back atcha.

320
00:14:29,306 --> 00:14:31,506
I'm not worried.

321
00:14:34,555 --> 00:14:35,755
Sid Olsen.

322
00:14:35,779 --> 00:14:37,660
Oh. Nice to meet you.

323
00:14:37,690 --> 00:14:39,189
Uh, Alan Harper.

324
00:14:39,231 --> 00:14:41,993
So, Alvin,
you play the ponies?

325
00:14:42,035 --> 00:14:44,425
Uh, I'm not much
of a gambler.

326
00:14:44,657 --> 00:14:47,592
I don't know, that shirt's
kind of a gamble.

327
00:14:49,605 --> 00:14:50,539
So, uh...

328
00:14:50,561 --> 00:14:52,748
what brings you
in here, Sid?

329
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:55,780
Besides dispensing
fashion advice?

330
00:14:55,952 --> 00:14:57,745
I like to get out,
make the rounds,

331
00:14:57,768 --> 00:15:00,344
you know, talk to
the young people.

332
00:15:00,441 --> 00:15:03,436
But I'll talk to you
until one comes along.

333
00:15:04,158 --> 00:15:06,699
Whether I like it or not.

334
00:15:06,734 --> 00:15:09,234
Oh, I got some more
advice for you, Albert.

335
00:15:09,276 --> 00:15:10,909
When you get to be my age,

336
00:15:10,951 --> 00:15:13,953
always bring a big
plastic cup into the john.

337
00:15:14,085 --> 00:15:14,921
Why?

338
00:15:14,953 --> 00:15:16,496
You gotta lower the water level

339
00:15:16,538 --> 00:15:18,541
or your nuts get wet.

340
00:15:18,966 --> 00:15:20,732
Oh, excuse me,
darlin', darlin'.

341
00:15:20,751 --> 00:15:22,588
Could we have some
more wings, please?

342
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:24,066
I'll have a
beer, please.

343
00:15:24,102 --> 00:15:26,169
You know, it's
all-you-can-eat for $6.99.

344
00:15:26,191 --> 00:15:27,644
It's also dollar beers.

345
00:15:27,675 --> 00:15:28,922
Yeah, I don't drink beer.

346
00:15:28,964 --> 00:15:31,202
It gives me the wind.

347
00:15:32,526 --> 00:15:34,564
What's your problem,
Alfred?

348
00:15:34,586 --> 00:15:36,026
I don't have a problem.

349
00:15:36,057 --> 00:15:37,126
Oh, come on.

350
00:15:37,155 --> 00:15:39,047
You're in a bar at
4:00 in the afternoon

351
00:15:39,090 --> 00:15:41,924
talking to an 80-year-old man
about his balls.

352
00:15:43,233 --> 00:15:45,000
You got a problem.

353
00:15:46,623 --> 00:15:47,642
Fine.

354
00:15:47,668 --> 00:15:50,438
I-I guess, uh, I've been
having relationship issues.

355
00:15:50,471 --> 00:15:51,549
Ah, I get it.

356
00:15:51,582 --> 00:15:53,417
I'm having trouble
with my wife.

357
00:15:53,454 --> 00:15:54,653
What's the matter?

358
00:15:54,682 --> 00:15:56,415
She's dead.

359
00:15:56,478 --> 00:15:58,329
Oh. Oh, I'm-I'm sorry.

360
00:15:58,367 --> 00:15:59,920
Ah, so am I.

361
00:15:59,949 --> 00:16:01,415
If she were still alive,

362
00:16:01,443 --> 00:16:03,277
I wouldn't have to be
talking to you.

363
00:16:03,314 --> 00:16:06,215
Now we both wish she was alive.

364
00:16:07,147 --> 00:16:08,874
Zing.

365
00:16:11,334 --> 00:16:14,308
Our marriage was the best
30 years of my life.

366
00:16:14,381 --> 00:16:17,278
My only complaint was
that she couldn't cook.

367
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:19,487
The woman could
screw up iced tea.

368
00:16:19,517 --> 00:16:21,784
I mean, you know the recipe
for iced tea?

369
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:23,667
It's ice. Tea.

370
00:16:23,697 --> 00:16:25,530
Done.

371
00:16:27,185 --> 00:16:30,221
Well, I guess you have to take
the good with the bad.

372
00:16:30,251 --> 00:16:32,753
You're smarter
than you look.

373
00:16:33,681 --> 00:16:36,500
You got a good one,
you gotta hang onto her.

374
00:16:36,530 --> 00:16:39,020
Yeah, but how do you know
you've got a good one?

375
00:16:39,066 --> 00:16:40,708
Well, you don't always know.

376
00:16:40,756 --> 00:16:43,291
Sometimes you just gotta
take the leap.

377
00:16:45,175 --> 00:16:47,376
Ah, here we go.
Thank you.

378
00:16:47,406 --> 00:16:49,573
Thank you very much.

379
00:16:51,945 --> 00:16:54,447
These are for my cat.

380
00:16:57,669 --> 00:17:00,112
I don't have a cat.

381
00:17:02,759 --> 00:17:07,191
Well, it was great
talking to you, Archie.

382
00:17:07,381 --> 00:17:08,893
Alan.

383
00:17:08,939 --> 00:17:10,605
Sid.

384
00:17:13,258 --> 00:17:15,180
Here's my card.

385
00:17:15,255 --> 00:17:16,955
Oh. Thanks.

386
00:17:17,016 --> 00:17:19,683
I'll call you if
I need a wingman.

387
00:17:20,972 --> 00:17:22,139
Get it?

388
00:17:22,186 --> 00:17:23,785
"Wingman."

389
00:17:23,830 --> 00:17:25,530
The-the chicken?

390
00:17:25,635 --> 00:17:28,277
Leave the jokes to me, Chuckles.

391
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:32,423
Aw, geez. I forgot my wallet.

392
00:17:32,469 --> 00:17:34,667
Don't worry.
I've got it.

393
00:17:34,779 --> 00:17:37,039
Thank you.
Much appreciated.

394
00:17:39,688 --> 00:17:41,856
Works every time.

395
00:17:50,146 --> 00:17:52,170
- Alan?
- We need to talk.

396
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:54,328
Oh, really?
Now you want to talk.

397
00:17:54,388 --> 00:17:56,692
I don't know, you just
kind of sprung this on me.

398
00:17:56,728 --> 00:17:58,343
Okay, I deserved that.

399
00:17:58,374 --> 00:18:00,341
But just listen, please.

400
00:18:00,377 --> 00:18:01,758
Go ahead.

401
00:18:01,786 --> 00:18:05,254
I've just come to
the realization that...

402
00:18:05,389 --> 00:18:08,679
I don't want to end up alone
with my nuts in the toilet.

403
00:18:08,709 --> 00:18:09,825
What?

404
00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:12,151
All I know is this.

405
00:18:12,198 --> 00:18:14,042
I was scared because

406
00:18:14,074 --> 00:18:16,675
every time I've made
a commitment to a woman,

407
00:18:16,692 --> 00:18:18,907
it's blown up in my face.

408
00:18:19,095 --> 00:18:22,018
But I'd rather be scared

409
00:18:22,058 --> 00:18:25,009
than risk losing you.

410
00:18:25,323 --> 00:18:27,845
I-I want to be with you forever.

411
00:18:28,886 --> 00:18:31,488
That's all I ever
wanted to hear.

412
00:18:31,534 --> 00:18:33,170
I-I love you, Lyndsey.

413
00:18:33,212 --> 00:18:36,113
And as soon as I can
save enough money,

414
00:18:36,146 --> 00:18:39,848
I'm gonna put a deposit down
on an engagement ring.

415
00:18:40,642 --> 00:18:43,293
You don't have to buy me
some dumb ring.

416
00:18:43,622 --> 00:18:46,456
That's all I ever
wanted to hear.

417
00:18:56,311 --> 00:18:57,511
Yeah?

418
00:18:57,565 --> 00:18:59,999
Is your mom here?

419
00:19:00,154 --> 00:19:01,887
My mom?

420
00:19:03,495 --> 00:19:05,920
Walden, what are you doing here?

421
00:19:05,952 --> 00:19:07,733
Well, I just wanted
to surprise you.

422
00:19:07,749 --> 00:19:10,216
Oh, that's very sweet.

423
00:19:10,259 --> 00:19:12,460
Baby, go put these in water.

424
00:19:12,810 --> 00:19:14,210
Yeah.

425
00:19:15,592 --> 00:19:18,528
Honey, you really have to
call before you come over.

426
00:19:18,779 --> 00:19:21,327
What's up with the kid
from Twilight?

427
00:19:21,713 --> 00:19:25,082
Oh, uh, he works
at Foot Locker.

428
00:19:25,381 --> 00:19:26,713
You know, he's like you,

429
00:19:26,727 --> 00:19:28,610
he just has a little
more ambition.

430
00:19:28,635 --> 00:19:30,735
Ambition?

431
00:19:30,762 --> 00:19:31,919
You're kidding me.

432
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:33,726
Oh, no, don't take
that the wrong way.

433
00:19:33,776 --> 00:19:36,530
I mean, you are very good
at what you can do.

434
00:19:36,779 --> 00:19:38,246
Okay.

435
00:19:38,588 --> 00:19:40,399
I'm a billionaire.

436
00:19:40,437 --> 00:19:42,003
I own my own company.

437
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:44,002
Oh. There's that imagination.

438
00:19:44,041 --> 00:19:46,744
Hey, that's what you
should be writing about.

439
00:19:46,768 --> 00:19:48,516
I'll call you, okay?

440
00:19:48,596 --> 00:19:51,891
I own my own freakin' jet!

441
00:19:55,199 --> 00:19:58,000
That's it.
I'm going to buy Foot Locker.

442
00:20:11,888 --> 00:20:14,490
Thank you for inviting me over,
Alfonso.

443
00:20:15,168 --> 00:20:17,168
No problem.

444
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:19,133
You, too, Winston.

445
00:20:19,183 --> 00:20:21,278
Any time, Sid.

446
00:20:21,342 --> 00:20:24,139
Look, I don't want to tar
anybody else's roof,

447
00:20:24,192 --> 00:20:27,376
but either one of you
tappin' the hot redhead?

448
00:20:27,732 --> 00:20:29,399
No.
No.

449
00:20:30,015 --> 00:20:32,292
Mind if I take
a swing at her?

450
00:20:32,344 --> 00:20:33,844
Go right ahead.

451
00:20:33,862 --> 00:20:35,795
Yeah, she might
swing back.

452
00:20:35,813 --> 00:20:37,859
Good.
I like 'em feisty.

453
00:20:44,698 --> 00:20:47,152
This may take a minute.

454
00:20:48,715 --> 00:20:51,248
Is your friend pool
that shallow?

455
00:20:54,592 --> 00:20:57,663
Hey, Red.
You like chicken wings?

456
