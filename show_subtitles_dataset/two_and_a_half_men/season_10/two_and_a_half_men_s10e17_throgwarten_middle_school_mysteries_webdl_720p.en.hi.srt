1
00:00:06,385 --> 00:00:08,318
Hi, future me.

2
00:00:09,537 --> 00:00:12,807
This is 17-year-old you
in your dorm room at M.I.T.

3
00:00:14,957 --> 00:00:16,579
Yeah, that's right.

4
00:00:16,591 --> 00:00:18,665
I did my own Pop Up Video.

5
00:00:18,695 --> 00:00:20,319
How cool is that?

6
00:00:22,671 --> 00:00:24,455
Still is.

7
00:00:24,481 --> 00:00:27,542
Hopefully you're watching this
from your implanted brain chip,

8
00:00:27,567 --> 00:00:30,417
aka the "Tran-Schmidter,"

9
00:00:30,848 --> 00:00:33,078
running proprietary software

10
00:00:33,117 --> 00:00:35,397
developed by
Walden Schmidt Enterprises.

11
00:00:35,416 --> 00:00:36,538
Failing that,

12
00:00:36,547 --> 00:00:38,848
hopefully you've at least
seen a girl naked.

13
00:00:39,455 --> 00:00:41,332
Hey, what you watching?

14
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:42,297
Check this out.

15
00:00:42,307 --> 00:00:45,232
I had all my old videotapes
digitized, and I found this.

16
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:47,794
Oh, my God,
is that you?

17
00:00:48,454 --> 00:00:50,906
You were nothing more
than an awkward,

18
00:00:50,923 --> 00:00:53,625
pimply-faced,
goofy-looking teenager.

19
00:00:56,330 --> 00:00:58,881
We would've been best friends.

20
00:01:00,192 --> 00:01:02,266
Yeah, I made it
when I was at M.I.T.

21
00:01:02,296 --> 00:01:04,197
It outlines everything
I wanted to accomplish

22
00:01:04,217 --> 00:01:05,742
by the time I turned 35.

23
00:01:05,764 --> 00:01:07,177
Oh, I did
a similar thing.

24
00:01:07,193 --> 00:01:08,747
Well, it wasn't
so much a video as, uh,

25
00:01:08,758 --> 00:01:10,646
something I wrote
on a cocktail napkin.

26
00:01:10,667 --> 00:01:12,860
"Don't kill yourself.
It'll get better."

27
00:01:13,942 --> 00:01:16,115
I was so naive.

28
00:01:17,086 --> 00:01:19,644
I hope you've accomplished
your first goal,

29
00:01:19,657 --> 00:01:22,490
as previously stated,
of seeing a girl naked.

30
00:01:22,515 --> 00:01:24,950
And I'm talking in person.

31
00:01:25,036 --> 00:01:28,188
Which I did a short
18 months later.

32
00:01:28,205 --> 00:01:29,435
Goal number two:

33
00:01:29,448 --> 00:01:31,081
Create your
own software company

34
00:01:31,099 --> 00:01:33,306
that revolutionizes
the industry standard

35
00:01:33,318 --> 00:01:36,559
for information transferral
at blinding speeds.

36
00:01:41,033 --> 00:01:43,957
Hear that?
56k dial-up.

37
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:45,279
In four hours,

38
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:48,703
I will have downloaded
the entire Spice Girls album.

39
00:01:57,189 --> 00:01:59,924
After building your company
from the ground up,

40
00:01:59,926 --> 00:02:01,871
you will sell it for...

41
00:02:02,054 --> 00:02:04,167
one million dollars.

42
00:02:07,291 --> 00:02:09,158
Well, that
didn't happen.

43
00:02:09,183 --> 00:02:12,695
I sold it
for one billion dollars.

44
00:02:14,877 --> 00:02:17,004
Yeah, baby!

45
00:02:18,551 --> 00:02:19,518
Don't.

46
00:02:19,557 --> 00:02:21,690
Just...
just don't.

47
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:24,483
Number three:

48
00:02:24,485 --> 00:02:27,126
live in a beautiful beach house.

49
00:02:27,159 --> 00:02:28,659
Nailed it.

50
00:02:28,688 --> 00:02:31,009
With the love of your life.

51
00:02:31,044 --> 00:02:32,861
Nailed it.

52
00:02:34,082 --> 00:02:36,918
Although it is kind of hard
to meet someone

53
00:02:36,947 --> 00:02:40,970
when you spend 20 hours a day
in the computer lab.

54
00:02:47,475 --> 00:02:49,543
Phyllis is now Phil.

55
00:02:49,545 --> 00:02:52,479
He's a commercial
fisherman in Baton Rouge.

56
00:02:52,481 --> 00:02:55,382
But I'm sure all this hard work
will be worth it someday

57
00:02:55,384 --> 00:02:57,684
when you're watching this video
with your beautiful wife,

58
00:02:57,686 --> 00:03:01,888
four kids, two dogs
and robot butler

59

00:03:04,826 --> 00:03:06,159
Hello, Walden.

61
00:03:06,161 --> 00:03:09,296
Would you like a root beer?

62
00:03:09,298 --> 00:03:11,031
Heck, yeah.

63
00:03:13,634 --> 00:03:16,036
Where did my life
take such a wrong turn?

64
00:03:16,038 --> 00:03:18,004
What are you talking about?

65
00:03:18,042 --> 00:03:20,608
I don't have any of those things
that matter.

66
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:22,844
No wife, no kids.

67
00:03:22,846 --> 00:03:25,206
All I have is you.

68
00:03:27,144 --> 00:03:28,900
Well...

69
00:03:29,786 --> 00:03:32,063
we could adopt.

Oh, hey.

74
00:03:52,758 --> 00:03:54,341
What are you doing up?

75
00:03:54,368 --> 00:03:56,468
Alan is sleep-sobbing again.

76
00:03:58,312 --> 00:04:00,413
You still
watching this thing?

77
00:04:00,447 --> 00:04:02,198
I'm a failure, Lyndsey.

78
00:04:02,236 --> 00:04:04,450
No, you're not, Walden.

79
00:04:04,474 --> 00:04:07,173
Although you looked
like one in college.

80
00:04:08,058 --> 00:04:09,559
Yeah, I kind of did.

81
00:04:09,581 --> 00:04:13,762
I mean, I wouldn't have slept with you,
and I slept with everybody.

82
00:04:13,796 --> 00:04:14,972
Got it.

83
00:04:15,003 --> 00:04:17,637
I even slept with
the janitor in my dorm.

84
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:19,869
Is this supposed
to cheer me up?

85
00:04:19,883 --> 00:04:21,701
Oh, I'm sorry.

86
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:22,826
I'm sorry.

87
00:04:22,854 --> 00:04:24,743
Look, when I was 18,

88
00:04:24,769 --> 00:04:26,957
I was convinced
I was gonna marry Axl Rose

89
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:28,588
and have my own TV show.

90
00:04:28,597 --> 00:04:30,330
Well, they don't give
TV shows to people

91
00:04:30,339 --> 00:04:32,143
just 'cause they're
good-looking.

92
00:04:36,501 --> 00:04:39,170
You know, Walden,
just 'cause your life

93
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:40,665
didn't turn out
the way you thought,

94
00:04:40,674 --> 00:04:42,140
doesn't mean
it's not a success.

95
00:04:42,163 --> 00:04:45,140
I mean, how many people
can say they're a billionaire?

96
00:04:45,175 --> 00:04:47,776
1,226.

97
00:04:48,588 --> 00:04:50,249
Seriously?

98
00:04:50,423 --> 00:04:52,657
That's a lot more
than I thought.

99
00:04:52,682 --> 00:04:54,264
Do you know them all?

100
00:04:54,274 --> 00:04:56,286
Well, there's not
a club or anything.

101
00:04:57,035 --> 00:05:00,237
But Buffett does host a
poker game once a month.

102
00:05:00,275 --> 00:05:02,235
Last time, I won Guatemala.

103
00:05:02,255 --> 00:05:03,093
Wow.

104
00:05:03,116 --> 00:05:06,413
And then I lost at the end
to the woman who invented Spanx.

105
00:05:06,533 --> 00:05:08,268
Mmm.

106
00:05:08,387 --> 00:05:09,887
Money doesn't mean anything

107
00:05:09,906 --> 00:05:11,676
if I don't have anyone
to share it with.

108
00:05:11,696 --> 00:05:12,848
Oh, I get that.

109
00:05:12,874 --> 00:05:15,107
But you're not going
to meet anybody

110
00:05:15,138 --> 00:05:18,073
sitting on your couch
feeling sorry for yourself.

111
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:19,943
Are you?

112
00:05:21,378 --> 00:05:22,964
I guess not.

113
00:05:22,982 --> 00:05:24,569
Damn.

114
00:05:24,587 --> 00:05:27,202
I just don't get
relationships.

115
00:05:27,226 --> 00:05:28,755
Nobody does.

116
00:05:28,771 --> 00:05:31,303
They're scary and messy.

117
00:05:31,554 --> 00:05:33,622
And sometimes
you get involved

118
00:05:33,638 --> 00:05:35,721
with somebody
you don't really like.

119
00:05:35,862 --> 00:05:38,825
And... one day, you find
yourself peeing on a stick,

120
00:05:39,147 --> 00:05:41,095
and the plus sign shows up

121
00:05:41,124 --> 00:05:42,767
and you have to give up
your dreams of being an actress

122
00:05:42,791 --> 00:05:44,516
so you can raise a kid
who can only do math

123
00:05:44,545 --> 00:05:47,012
when he's figuring out
the cost of weed.

124
00:05:48,105 --> 00:05:50,914
Pep talks really aren't
your strong suit, are they?

125
00:05:51,576 --> 00:05:53,549
I'm just saying,

126
00:05:53,575 --> 00:05:56,076
things happen,
but you can't give up.

127
00:05:56,087 --> 00:05:58,044
I mean, if I
had stopped looking,

128
00:05:58,070 --> 00:06:01,237
I never would've found my
amazing, wonderful boyfriend.

129
00:06:01,891 --> 00:06:04,195
Oh, you're
cheating on Alan?

130
00:06:08,838 --> 00:06:09,674
Hey.

131
00:06:09,694 --> 00:06:12,305
Uh, would you eat
expired pudding?

132
00:06:21,071 --> 00:06:22,123
No.

133
00:06:22,142 --> 00:06:24,155
Oh, good.
Then I can have it.

134
00:06:24,193 --> 00:06:26,198
Knock yourself out.

135
00:06:26,216 --> 00:06:27,481
What you doing?

136
00:06:27,507 --> 00:06:30,085
I'm looking for
this card, and I can't...

137
00:06:30,099 --> 00:06:31,909
Ah, there it is.

138
00:06:31,944 --> 00:06:35,245
"Emily's Elite
and Discreet Introductions."

139
00:06:35,276 --> 00:06:37,321
Oh, fancy call girls.

140
00:06:37,375 --> 00:06:38,825
I like it.

141
00:06:38,850 --> 00:06:40,711
No, it's a dating service.

142
00:06:40,737 --> 00:06:43,591
Oh, right.
"Dating service." Wink-wink.

143
00:06:43,814 --> 00:06:45,804
You know,
I want to like you,

144
00:06:45,819 --> 00:06:48,418
but sometimes
you make it so hard.

145
00:06:49,170 --> 00:06:52,673
"Substantial relationships
for substantial people."

146
00:06:52,701 --> 00:06:54,894
Ah, big girls.

147
00:06:56,185 --> 00:06:58,374
Get your smoosh on.

148
00:06:58,711 --> 00:07:01,308
They throw mixers
for single rich people.

149
00:07:01,328 --> 00:07:03,502
I wouldn't think you'd be
into that kind of thing.

150
00:07:03,528 --> 00:07:05,261
You've always been a...
a "fate" kind of guy.

151
00:07:05,275 --> 00:07:06,874
Yeah, well,
I'm gonna create my own fate.

152
00:07:06,882 --> 00:07:07,915
Lyndsey's right.

153
00:07:07,941 --> 00:07:10,864
I'm not gonna find anyone sitting around here
feeling sorry for myself.

154
00:07:10,897 --> 00:07:12,969
No, you're not.

155
00:07:12,992 --> 00:07:14,845
Are you?

156
00:07:16,205 --> 00:07:18,107
- What?
- Nothing.

157
00:07:18,124 --> 00:07:19,965
Hey, uh, can I go along?

158
00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:22,476
- No, you have Lyndsey.
- I'd be doing it for her.

159
00:07:22,496 --> 00:07:26,166
Look, I'll find a rich,
90-year-old woman with a bad ticker,

160
00:07:26,188 --> 00:07:27,998
give her the best three minutes
of her life,

161
00:07:28,031 --> 00:07:30,216
and then, you know,
send her out with a bang...

162
00:07:30,679 --> 00:07:33,638
then spend
my inheritance on Lyndsey.

163
00:07:33,702 --> 00:07:36,736
Or whatever's left
after my grief cruise.

164
00:07:37,403 --> 00:07:40,605
Again, you make it really hard
to like you.

165
00:07:41,816 --> 00:07:43,583
I just want
a sugar mama.

166
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:44,883
Yeah, you have one.

167
00:07:44,907 --> 00:07:47,107
Her name is Walden.

168
00:07:53,596 --> 00:07:55,781
Walden, we have a
great mixer tonight.

169
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:58,547
I hope you're ready to meet
some substantial women.

170
00:07:58,584 --> 00:08:01,436
Yep, I'm ready
to get my smoosh on.

171
00:08:03,202 --> 00:08:05,400
I'm sorry.
I'm just really nervous.

172
00:08:05,414 --> 00:08:06,607
Don't be.

173
00:08:06,629 --> 00:08:08,901
Everyone here is rich
and looking for love.

174
00:08:08,919 --> 00:08:12,250
The only woman in this room
who wants you for your money is me.

175
00:08:12,285 --> 00:08:14,418
Happy mingling.

176
00:08:14,589 --> 00:08:16,522
Okay.

177
00:08:23,808 --> 00:08:25,579
Hello.

178
00:08:25,614 --> 00:08:27,086
Hello.

179
00:08:27,106 --> 00:08:29,205
Trust fund or tech?

180
00:08:29,226 --> 00:08:30,219
Excuse me?

181
00:08:30,241 --> 00:08:32,753
The way you're dressed means
you're either the beneficiary of a trust fund

182
00:08:32,777 --> 00:08:34,061
or in the tech business.

183
00:08:34,079 --> 00:08:36,992
Unless you're working here,
in which case I need another drink.

184
00:08:37,015 --> 00:08:40,063
Ac-Actually, I'm in tech.
I started my own company when I was...

185
00:08:40,092 --> 00:08:42,159
What do your
Fridays look like?

186
00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:46,006
Uh, a lot like my Thursdays,
just one day later.

187
00:08:47,016 --> 00:08:48,316
A sense of humor.

188
00:08:48,330 --> 00:08:50,641
Some people find
that attractive.

189
00:08:52,245 --> 00:08:54,328
Are you one of them?

190
00:08:54,625 --> 00:08:55,825
I love to laugh.

191
00:08:55,850 --> 00:08:57,950
Now, I've got
Friday evenings,

192
00:08:57,975 --> 00:09:00,199
Sunday afternoons
and ski season.

193
00:09:00,219 --> 00:09:01,957
How does that
work for you?

194
00:09:01,976 --> 00:09:04,788
What...? So... Don't you want
to at least know my name?

195
00:09:04,802 --> 00:09:06,736
Really?

196
00:09:06,775 --> 00:09:08,949
We have to do all this?

197
00:09:08,984 --> 00:09:10,607
All right,
I'm Sylvia Miller,

198
00:09:10,625 --> 00:09:13,092
and I'm the CEO of a major
pharmaceutical company.

199
00:09:13,125 --> 00:09:15,038
- Wow, very impressive.
- Yes.

200
00:09:15,070 --> 00:09:18,134
Every time you get an erection,
you owe me ten dollars.

201
00:09:18,759 --> 00:09:20,360
See? Sense of humor.

202
00:09:20,381 --> 00:09:22,546
Now, Fridays and Sundays.

203
00:09:22,586 --> 00:09:25,478
I just thought maybe we could
spend some time

204
00:09:25,508 --> 00:09:28,012
- getting to know each...
- Nice talking to you.

205
00:09:28,966 --> 00:09:31,835
Okay, I'll put her
on the "maybe" pile.

206
00:09:31,865 --> 00:09:33,458
Hi, How you doing?

207
00:09:33,469 --> 00:09:35,492
Oh, hi. I'm Walden Schmidt.

208
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:37,932
Nice to meet you.
TC Randall.

209
00:09:39,151 --> 00:09:41,360
You're the TC Randall?

210
00:09:41,402 --> 00:09:44,616
Author of Throgwarten
Middle School Mysteries?

211
00:09:44,647 --> 00:09:46,753
I-I've read all your books.

212
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:47,946
Really?

213
00:09:47,966 --> 00:09:49,837
Yeah, I... Who hasn't?

214
00:09:49,871 --> 00:09:51,755
Grown men.

215
00:09:52,324 --> 00:09:55,321
Their loss. I mean, you're-you're
an amazing author.

216
00:09:55,343 --> 00:09:56,527
Thank you.

217
00:09:56,542 --> 00:09:59,043
Oh, you know, I do have
one question, though.

218
00:09:59,058 --> 00:10:02,344
In-in book three,
the dragons inexplicably

219
00:10:02,372 --> 00:10:03,780
lose their ability to breathe fire

220
00:10:03,801 --> 00:10:06,951
when clearly, in book two,
the wizards gave them that ability.

221
00:10:06,973 --> 00:10:10,666
Was that a setup for
book four or an oversight?

222
00:10:11,167 --> 00:10:13,266
They're children's books.

223
00:10:13,513 --> 00:10:15,746
Well, it says on the cover

224
00:10:15,766 --> 00:10:19,334
they're for wizards, dragon
trainers and kids of all ages.

225
00:10:19,406 --> 00:10:21,476
Okay, you're right.
I'm sorry.

226
00:10:21,497 --> 00:10:25,633
Um, the dragons lost
their ability to breathe fire

227
00:10:25,672 --> 00:10:27,753
in the Caverns of Chaos.

228
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:30,399
Ah, come on, They didn't even go
to the Caverns of Chaos

229
00:10:30,418 --> 00:10:33,019
until they solved the
mystery of the missing map.

230
00:10:33,036 --> 00:10:34,602
All right, you know what?

231
00:10:34,643 --> 00:10:38,015
When I wrote those books,
I was addicted to painkillers.

232
00:10:38,076 --> 00:10:41,211
They make no sense, but they
make me a ton of money,

233
00:10:41,239 --> 00:10:43,825
so cut me some slack.

234
00:10:44,905 --> 00:10:48,183
Probably got the painkillers
from the pharmaceutical chick.

235
00:10:50,336 --> 00:10:52,388
So, any luck so far?

236
00:10:52,415 --> 00:10:53,413
No, not yet.

237
00:10:53,421 --> 00:10:55,917
Oh, well, don't worry.
There are plenty of women here.

238
00:10:55,940 --> 00:10:57,173
Well, how about them?

239
00:10:57,197 --> 00:10:58,997
Um, Sarah's oil money.

240
00:10:59,030 --> 00:11:01,230
Stephanie is a tobacco heiress,

241
00:11:01,256 --> 00:11:04,944
and Amy had sex with a senator
and owns the video.

242
00:11:05,919 --> 00:11:07,486
Oh, my God.

243
00:11:07,513 --> 00:11:09,947
I don't care how,
I care how much.

244
00:11:10,535 --> 00:11:13,708
Uh, no. The... woman
in the green dress.

245
00:11:13,743 --> 00:11:16,605
I used to be
married to her.

246
00:11:16,643 --> 00:11:18,013
Oh, oh, I'm sorry.

247
00:11:18,025 --> 00:11:20,574
I-I try to avoid
situations like this.

248
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:22,638
No. You know what?
It's fine. I'll...

249
00:11:22,667 --> 00:11:24,194
I'll just go say hello.

250
00:11:24,214 --> 00:11:26,220
Sure. What's the worst
that can happen?

251
00:11:26,241 --> 00:11:28,274
She's already got
half your money.

252
00:11:38,542 --> 00:11:39,901
Bridget?

253
00:11:40,078 --> 00:11:41,588
Walden?

254
00:11:41,917 --> 00:11:44,045
What are you doing here?

255
00:11:44,305 --> 00:11:46,399
Just... drinking a beer,

256
00:11:46,428 --> 00:11:48,492
losing faith in humanity,

257
00:11:48,521 --> 00:11:50,221
planning to die alone.

258
00:11:50,257 --> 00:11:53,072
I get it.
These people are awful.

259
00:11:53,105 --> 00:11:56,173
The last guy I talked to
offered to give me a boob job.

260
00:11:56,205 --> 00:11:57,606
A plastic surgeon?

261
00:11:57,620 --> 00:11:59,775
Unfortunately, no.

262
00:11:59,806 --> 00:12:01,886
So, you haven't met
anyone, either?

263
00:12:01,951 --> 00:12:04,686
No. I'm actually thinking
about going next door.

264
00:12:04,712 --> 00:12:07,813
The Goldberg Bar Mitzvah
seems like it's going off.

265
00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:09,383
Mmm. Well, good luck to you.

266
00:12:09,408 --> 00:12:11,814
I hope you find
what you're looking for.

267
00:12:12,831 --> 00:12:16,333
So, did I find what
I was looking for?

268
00:12:16,350 --> 00:12:17,937
Oh, yeah.

269
00:12:21,718 --> 00:12:24,553
- So...
- Yeah.

270
00:12:25,930 --> 00:12:27,847
That happened.

271
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,028
Twice.

272
00:12:30,061 --> 00:12:32,010
Three for me.

273
00:12:32,050 --> 00:12:33,716
- Oh, that's great.
- Yeah.

274
00:12:33,735 --> 00:12:37,107
The third time, I thought you were screaming
just 'cause I was on your hair.

275
00:12:38,722 --> 00:12:41,490
- Can I ask you a question?
- Sure.

276
00:12:41,507 --> 00:12:43,274
What does this mean?

277
00:12:43,292 --> 00:12:45,559
It means
we both paid $1,000

278
00:12:45,569 --> 00:12:47,803
to meet someone
we already slept with.

279
00:12:49,701 --> 00:12:51,907
Wait, you paid $1,000?

280
00:12:51,932 --> 00:12:53,464
I paid $2,000.

281
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:56,702
Looks like you got screwed
a lot tonight.

282
00:12:58,211 --> 00:13:00,178
The answer is...

283
00:13:00,192 --> 00:13:02,407
I don't know
what it means.

284
00:13:02,432 --> 00:13:05,202
- I just know it feels right.
- It does.

285
00:13:05,244 --> 00:13:07,424
Which is odd
because we just did

286
00:13:07,463 --> 00:13:10,164
a couple things that
were very, very wrong.

287
00:13:11,046 --> 00:13:14,754
So, how do we make sure we don't end up
where we were before?

288
00:13:14,788 --> 00:13:16,254
Well, that's...

289
00:13:16,298 --> 00:13:18,442
Everything that happened
before was your fault,

290
00:13:18,475 --> 00:13:20,745
so it's kind of up to you.

291
00:13:21,763 --> 00:13:24,487
I'm a different person than
I was when we split up.

292
00:13:24,506 --> 00:13:25,979
That's good.

293
00:13:25,991 --> 00:13:29,047
'Cause towards the end, I felt more
like your mother than your wife.

294
00:13:29,069 --> 00:13:32,075
Oh, you're a much better
kisser than my mom.

295
00:13:32,103 --> 00:13:34,204
So are you.

296
00:13:34,751 --> 00:13:36,684
Uh, the truth is...

297
00:13:36,712 --> 00:13:39,060
I've grown up a lot since then.

298
00:13:39,087 --> 00:13:41,279
I don't need anyone
to take care of me now.

299
00:13:41,307 --> 00:13:43,902
So I don't have to check under
the bed for monsters anymore?

300
00:13:43,925 --> 00:13:46,358
No, of course not.
Alan does that.

301
00:13:46,381 --> 00:13:48,596
Does Alan do this?

302
00:13:48,642 --> 00:13:50,373
Yes.

303
00:13:51,813 --> 00:13:53,631
Well...

304
00:13:53,975 --> 00:13:56,577
Uh, he does not do that.

305
00:13:59,619 --> 00:14:02,588
Can't believe you guys
are back together.

306
00:14:02,616 --> 00:14:04,950
Walden and Bridget.
Bridget and Walden.

307
00:14:04,972 --> 00:14:06,360
And Alan.

308
00:14:06,381 --> 00:14:08,123
The... three musketeers.

309
00:14:08,142 --> 00:14:09,186
Or three's a crowd.

310
00:14:09,195 --> 00:14:10,227
Or three's company.

311
00:14:10,244 --> 00:14:12,054
Or three strikes
and you're out.

312
00:14:12,076 --> 00:14:14,577
Okay, okay. Just play nice.

313
00:14:15,969 --> 00:14:17,658
Sorry.

314
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:19,761
So, uh, Bridget, uh...

315
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:21,894
after you and Walden broke up,

316
00:14:21,909 --> 00:14:24,410
didn't you immediately
start dating his best friend

317
00:14:24,429 --> 00:14:26,052
and business partner, Billy?

318
00:14:26,071 --> 00:14:27,942
I did, but in
hindsight, I realize

319
00:14:27,962 --> 00:14:30,646
it was just a pathetic
attempt to stay close to Walden.

320
00:14:30,664 --> 00:14:32,597
You know what that's like,
don't you, Alan?

321
00:14:34,947 --> 00:14:37,178
All right, that was a good one.

322
00:14:39,066 --> 00:14:40,833
What are you eating?

323
00:14:40,854 --> 00:14:43,722
Oh. It's a bacon,
egg and cheese sandwich

324
00:14:43,754 --> 00:14:45,348
with pancakes as the bread.

325
00:14:45,373 --> 00:14:47,407
I call it a McWalden.

326
00:14:47,569 --> 00:14:49,646
I call it a McBypass.

327
00:14:49,969 --> 00:14:52,303
It has all
the basic food groups:

328
00:14:52,336 --> 00:14:54,498
protein, dairy...

329
00:14:54,536 --> 00:14:56,136
syrup.

330
00:14:56,166 --> 00:14:58,190
If you don't eat properly,

331
00:14:58,205 --> 00:15:00,739
your immune system
can't do its job.

332
00:15:00,812 --> 00:15:02,512
I have had more colds this year.

333
00:15:02,538 --> 00:15:05,002
See? I'm gonna pour you a glass

334
00:15:05,029 --> 00:15:07,699
of fresh orange juice
to wash that down.

335
00:15:07,730 --> 00:15:09,596
She's doing it again.

336
00:15:09,622 --> 00:15:10,769
What?

337
00:15:10,804 --> 00:15:12,103
Telling you what to do.

338
00:15:12,132 --> 00:15:14,288
She just cares about me.

339
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,320
Shut up.

340
00:15:16,917 --> 00:15:18,630
Here you go.

341
00:15:18,655 --> 00:15:20,655
Okay, I think
you're all done with that.

342
00:15:20,677 --> 00:15:21,526
Oh, um, actually,
I was not...

343
00:15:21,541 --> 00:15:22,740
- Drink your juice.
- Okay.

344
00:15:22,753 --> 00:15:25,084
And when you're done, I want you
to go upstairs and make your bed.

345
00:15:25,088 --> 00:15:25,703
Mmm.

346
00:15:25,802 --> 00:15:28,184
- But Berta does it.
- No buts.

347
00:15:28,545 --> 00:15:30,072
Okay.

348
00:15:31,649 --> 00:15:33,501
Run...

349
00:15:39,081 --> 00:15:43,617
I'm so... glad that we
found each other again.

350
00:15:43,619 --> 00:15:45,786
Me, too.

351
00:15:46,981 --> 00:15:49,315
I want to try something.

352
00:15:49,354 --> 00:15:52,056
Whatever it is, I am in.

353
00:15:52,089 --> 00:15:53,965
It's pretty extreme.

354
00:15:53,989 --> 00:15:55,673
Oh, yay!

355
00:15:57,285 --> 00:15:59,437
Are you ready
to have your mind blown?

356
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:01,738
Among other things.

357
00:16:05,632 --> 00:16:09,935
Let's... wait.

358
00:16:12,196 --> 00:16:14,401
For what?

359
00:16:14,693 --> 00:16:17,577
Let's not have sex tonight.

360
00:16:18,188 --> 00:16:20,554
Let's wait.

361
00:16:21,356 --> 00:16:24,234
I'm not sure
that I follow.

362
00:16:24,470 --> 00:16:26,704
Imagine how much deeper

363
00:16:26,735 --> 00:16:29,369
we could connect
on an emotional level

364
00:16:29,393 --> 00:16:32,097
if we weren't prisoners
of our pelvis.

365
00:16:32,214 --> 00:16:34,447
But I like that prison.

366
00:16:34,474 --> 00:16:37,625
I just... I just don't
want to be in solitary.

367
00:16:37,876 --> 00:16:39,458
I'm serious, Walden.

368
00:16:39,488 --> 00:16:42,140
I want sex to be more
than just a physical release.

369
00:16:42,170 --> 00:16:44,404
I want it
to be a special event.

370
00:16:44,481 --> 00:16:47,649
Okay, are we talking
special event like...

371
00:16:47,686 --> 00:16:49,685
Monday Night Football?

372
00:16:49,716 --> 00:16:52,400
Or special event
like Halley's Comet?

373
00:16:52,856 --> 00:16:54,823
I'll let you know.

374
00:16:55,086 --> 00:16:57,775
But in the meantime,
there's other stuff we could do.

375
00:16:57,822 --> 00:17:00,256
Oh, I like other stuff.

376
00:17:00,431 --> 00:17:02,131
What do you have in mind?

377
00:17:02,149 --> 00:17:04,113
We can cuddle.

378
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:06,553
Cuddle?

379
00:17:06,575 --> 00:17:08,545
I think it would really
help us connect.

380
00:17:08,572 --> 00:17:10,565
Let's try it.

381
00:17:11,837 --> 00:17:13,942
Mmm.

382
00:17:13,993 --> 00:17:16,313
See? Isn't this nice?

383
00:17:16,335 --> 00:17:18,235
Mmm, mmm.

384
00:17:18,515 --> 00:17:22,216
This is... so much better
than having nasty old sex.

385
00:17:22,218 --> 00:17:23,751
Mm-hmm.

386
00:17:23,753 --> 00:17:25,987
This is...

387
00:17:25,989 --> 00:17:28,456
Mmm.

388
00:17:32,194 --> 00:17:35,564
So, how do we know
when we're done?

389
00:17:38,933 --> 00:17:41,069
There you are, Alan.

390
00:17:41,071 --> 00:17:43,872
Come. Join us, please.

391
00:17:48,144 --> 00:17:50,311
Oh, this can't be good.

392
00:17:53,482 --> 00:17:55,506
So, uh...

393
00:17:55,876 --> 00:17:57,409
what's going on?

394
00:17:57,429 --> 00:17:59,228
Walden.

395
00:18:04,247 --> 00:18:06,129
Um...

396
00:18:06,168 --> 00:18:08,697
first, I would like to say

397
00:18:08,724 --> 00:18:10,948
that I appreciate

398
00:18:11,168 --> 00:18:13,566
what a great friend you are.

399
00:18:14,337 --> 00:18:16,206
Thank you?

400
00:18:17,803 --> 00:18:20,300
Uh, which
makes it hard for me...

401
00:18:20,345 --> 00:18:22,794
Oh, no.
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

402
00:18:24,104 --> 00:18:26,029
Bridget feels that...

403
00:18:26,038 --> 00:18:28,223
We feel...

404
00:18:28,259 --> 00:18:31,427
that you living here
is no longer,

405
00:18:31,495 --> 00:18:35,296
beneficial to the goals
of this household.

406
00:18:36,458 --> 00:18:37,958
Buh-bye.

407
00:18:39,855 --> 00:18:41,136
Fine, fine.

408
00:18:41,177 --> 00:18:43,598
Let me just say one thing.

409
00:18:43,616 --> 00:18:45,549
Okay, when you guys broke up
the first time,

410
00:18:45,578 --> 00:18:47,622
it's because Bridget
thought you were a child.

411
00:18:47,637 --> 00:18:49,859
Turns out she's the one
who keeps you a child

412
00:18:49,874 --> 00:18:51,706
by controlling
everything you do.

413
00:18:51,718 --> 00:18:53,584
Nuh-uh.

414
00:18:53,599 --> 00:18:54,694
Mark my words.

415
00:18:54,711 --> 00:18:56,964
Next, she'll start with holding sex.

416
00:18:58,746 --> 00:19:01,148
You'll be like a dog
begging for a bone.

417
00:19:01,150 --> 00:19:02,750
Or a dog with a bone.

418
00:19:02,752 --> 00:19:05,653
Either way,
a bone will be involved.

419
00:19:07,092 --> 00:19:09,357
Why is Zippy so upset?

420
00:19:09,359 --> 00:19:11,159
Walden asked him
to move out.

421
00:19:11,161 --> 00:19:13,629
It's about time.

422
00:19:13,631 --> 00:19:14,777
Hey, Berta?

423
00:19:14,804 --> 00:19:15,724
Yeah?

424
00:19:15,744 --> 00:19:17,862
Um, why don't
you have a seat?

425
00:19:17,907 --> 00:19:20,107
Ah, crap.

426
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:32,180
Hi, sleepyhead.

427
00:19:32,306 --> 00:19:33,399
Hi.

428
00:19:33,423 --> 00:19:36,652
Isn't this nice?
Just the two of us?

429
00:19:36,887 --> 00:19:39,055
I'm a little groggy.

430
00:19:39,141 --> 00:19:40,622
What happened?

431
00:19:40,624 --> 00:19:43,550
I have a little
surprise for you.

432
00:19:43,597 --> 00:19:45,431
Oh.

433
00:19:45,476 --> 00:19:47,343
What is it?

434
00:19:50,335 --> 00:19:52,336
My balls?

435
00:19:52,639 --> 00:19:54,343
No, sweetie.

436
00:19:54,367 --> 00:19:56,254
My balls.

437
00:20:08,005 --> 00:20:09,652
How'd it go with
your ex-wife?

438
00:20:09,654 --> 00:20:10,953
It was a nightmare.

439
00:20:15,258 --> 00:20:17,927
Uh, hello, future Alan Harper.

440
00:20:17,971 --> 00:20:20,472
Uh, it's you from the past,

441
00:20:20,577 --> 00:20:23,648
uh, outlining my goals
for the next 50 years.

442
00:20:23,714 --> 00:20:27,011
Uh, I hope this finds you still

443
00:20:27,072 --> 00:20:29,239
on this comfortable couch,

444
00:20:29,286 --> 00:20:31,258
in this lovely beach house,

445
00:20:31,302 --> 00:20:33,735
um, hopefully, uh, with Walden

446
00:20:33,802 --> 00:20:36,637
or whoever moves in after him.

447
00:20:38,157 --> 00:20:40,325
Nailed it.

448
00:20:42,067 --> 00:20:43,667
What?

449
00:20:44,213 --> 00:20:46,147
I-I said,

450
00:20:46,227 --> 00:20:48,222
"Nailed it."

451
00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:54,841
If you want coffee,
go make coffee!

452
00:20:57,853 --> 00:20:59,751
Buffalo!
