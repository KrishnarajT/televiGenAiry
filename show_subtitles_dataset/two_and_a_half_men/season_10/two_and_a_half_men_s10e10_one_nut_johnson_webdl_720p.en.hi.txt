1
00:00:05,025 --> 00:00:07,726
Oh, incoming,
three o'clock.

2
00:00:08,862 --> 00:00:10,696
Wow.

3
00:00:10,698 --> 00:00:12,948
If I were available,
I'd be all over that.

4
00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:14,283
So being unavailable

5
00:00:14,285 --> 00:00:15,668
is the only thing
that's stopping you?

6
00:00:15,670 --> 00:00:20,339
Well, that and her obvious,
but unvoiced contempt for me.

7
00:00:21,458 --> 00:00:23,208
Why don't you
make a move?

8
00:00:23,210 --> 00:00:24,426
Aw, what's the point?

9
00:00:24,428 --> 00:00:26,262
Let's say I start talking
to her, and we hit it off.

10
00:00:26,264 --> 00:00:28,213
And by "hit it
off," you mean

11
00:00:28,215 --> 00:00:29,632
hit it off.

12
00:00:30,917 --> 00:00:33,719
Hmm, more unvoiced
contempt. Hmm.

13
00:00:33,721 --> 00:00:35,521
I can voice it if you'd like.

14
00:00:35,523 --> 00:00:37,473
No thanks.

15
00:00:37,475 --> 00:00:39,725
What do you think is gonna
happen as soon as she finds out

16
00:00:39,727 --> 00:00:41,110
how much money I have
in the bank?

17
00:00:41,112 --> 00:00:44,113
She's gonna want you
to make a deposit.

18
00:00:44,115 --> 00:00:47,149
And there's the problem.

19
00:00:47,151 --> 00:00:48,901
I-I see no problem.

20
00:00:48,903 --> 00:00:51,737
'Kay. It's not me
that she'd be interested in.

21
00:00:51,739 --> 00:00:54,406
It's what I can do for her.
It's the lifestyle.

22
00:00:54,408 --> 00:00:56,041
So what? You
still got laid.

23
00:00:56,043 --> 00:00:57,493
Trust me, it gets old.

24
00:00:57,495 --> 00:00:59,411
It's like having
a magic golf club:

25
00:00:59,413 --> 00:01:02,247
every time you take a shot,
the ball just goes in the hole.

26
00:01:02,249 --> 00:01:04,616
Oh, yeah!
Ker-plunk!

27
00:01:04,618 --> 00:01:08,220
Okay, apparently, you
need a demonstration.

28
00:01:08,222 --> 00:01:09,838
And no more alcohol.

29
00:01:11,141 --> 00:01:12,675
Hi.

30
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:15,144
I'm Walden Schmidt.

31
00:01:15,146 --> 00:01:16,595
Hello.

32
00:01:16,597 --> 00:01:19,631
That's "Schmidt,"
S-C-H-M-I-D-T.

33
00:01:19,633 --> 00:01:22,318
Uh, okay. It's nice
to meet you, Walden.

34
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:26,188
I'm Susan. S-U-S-A-N.

35
00:01:26,190 --> 00:01:28,473
Can I buy you
a drink, Susan?

36
00:01:28,475 --> 00:01:31,694
No, thanks. I'm waiting
for some friends.

37
00:01:31,696 --> 00:01:32,978
No problem.
Excuse me.

38
00:01:32,980 --> 00:01:34,697
Hmm. There goes
your theory.

39
00:01:34,699 --> 00:01:35,614
You struck out!

40
00:01:35,616 --> 00:01:37,082
Au contraire,
mon frère.

41
00:01:37,084 --> 00:01:39,335
Right now, she's heading
into the bathroom.

42
00:01:39,337 --> 00:01:41,787
What do you think
she's doing in there?

43
00:01:41,789 --> 00:01:43,005
Uh, I'm guessing tinkle.

44
00:01:43,007 --> 00:01:45,657
Girls poop at home.

45
00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:47,426
No. She's wondering,

46
00:01:47,428 --> 00:01:49,628
"Why did he spell his last name?

47
00:01:49,630 --> 00:01:51,180
Maybe I should know who he is."

48
00:01:51,182 --> 00:01:53,999
So, now, she's taking out
her phone and Googling me.

49
00:01:54,001 --> 00:01:55,167
Oh, I tried that once,

50
00:01:55,169 --> 00:01:57,353
and I dropped my phone
in the toilet.

51
00:01:57,355 --> 00:02:00,005
Fortunately, it was right
after a courtesy flush.

52
00:02:00,007 --> 00:02:03,225
The first hit on my name
is the Forbes 500 Web site,

53
00:02:03,227 --> 00:02:05,611
at which point in time
she finds out

54
00:02:05,613 --> 00:02:07,345
exactly how much money I make,

55
00:02:07,347 --> 00:02:09,231
she forgets to go
to the bathroom,

56
00:02:09,233 --> 00:02:12,067
along with everything
she learned in Sunday school,

57
00:02:12,069 --> 00:02:15,821
slaps on some lipstick
and comes back into the bar.

58
00:02:15,823 --> 00:02:17,489
Wow.

59
00:02:17,491 --> 00:02:20,492
She probably unbuttons
one button on her blouse...

60
00:02:20,494 --> 00:02:21,877
and...

61
00:02:21,879 --> 00:02:22,878
You know what?

62
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:26,215
I changed my mind
about that drink.

63
00:02:26,217 --> 00:02:28,751
I still don't
see the problem.

67
00:02:37,418 --> 00:02:40,418
== sync, corrected by elderman ==

68
00:02:40,419 --> 00:02:41,684
Can't believe
you're coming home with me

69
00:02:41,685 --> 00:02:42,884
instead of that girl.

70
00:02:42,886 --> 00:02:44,186
Not that I'm
not flattered.

71
00:02:44,188 --> 00:02:46,688
And not that I'm not willing
to do things.

72
00:02:46,690 --> 00:02:49,007
Just because a woman
wants to have sex with me,

73
00:02:49,009 --> 00:02:51,346
doesn't mean I want
to have sex with her.

74
00:02:51,348 --> 00:02:53,215
Okay, I hear the words coming
out of your mouth,

75
00:02:53,268 --> 00:02:54,768
I just don't
understand them.

76
00:02:55,189 --> 00:02:56,855
It's like watching
HBO in Spanish.

77
00:02:56,857 --> 00:03:00,192
Well, look, call me crazy,
but I am determined to find

78
00:03:00,194 --> 00:03:04,446
someone who wants to be with me
for who I am, not what I have.

79
00:03:04,448 --> 00:03:07,499
Hola, bienvenidos
a HBO en español.

80
00:03:08,568 --> 00:03:09,718
Come on.

81
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:11,620
I bet you have no doubt

82
00:03:11,622 --> 00:03:13,505
as to whether or not
Lyndsey loves you.

83
00:03:13,507 --> 00:03:14,739
I would guess that's true.

84
00:03:14,741 --> 00:03:16,091
You don't have to guess.

85
00:03:16,093 --> 00:03:18,260
You have no money,
no house, no future, no...

86
00:03:18,262 --> 00:03:20,912
Okay, okay!
Talking past the sale.

87
00:03:20,914 --> 00:03:23,748
But if you think my life
is so great, be my guest.

88
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:25,083
Take it.
What?

89
00:03:25,085 --> 00:03:27,135
Pretend to be me. I can't
tell you how many times

90
00:03:27,137 --> 00:03:28,103
I've pretended to be you.

91
00:03:28,105 --> 00:03:29,388
And-And not
just you.

92
00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:32,257
Uh, I've also pretended
to be a thoracic surgeon

93
00:03:32,259 --> 00:03:35,277
uh... a movie producer,
a stockbroker,

94
00:03:35,279 --> 00:03:37,813
and on one occasion,
a hand model.

95
00:03:37,815 --> 00:03:39,064
A hand model?

96
00:03:39,066 --> 00:03:40,866
Blind girl. Long story,
didn't end well.

97
00:03:42,535 --> 00:03:44,795
My point is, you can be
whoever you want to be.

98
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:45,622
Hmm.

99
00:03:45,623 --> 00:03:47,072
Never thought about it
like that.

100
00:03:47,074 --> 00:03:50,208
Course not. Why would Superman
want to be Clark Kent?

101
00:03:51,027 --> 00:03:53,778
Okay. Know what?
I'm gonna do this.

102
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:56,415
First thing I need
to do is create

103
00:03:56,417 --> 00:03:58,884
an online presence
for my fictional self.

104
00:03:58,886 --> 00:04:00,619
Mm. That's good.
I usually just throw ketchup

105
00:04:00,621 --> 00:04:03,338
on some scrubs
and say I came from surgery.

106
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:06,842
Okay. Let's start by creating
a Facebook page.

107
00:04:06,844 --> 00:04:10,596
Uh, all right, if I was
a struggling, broke-ass guy,

108
00:04:10,598 --> 00:04:11,930
what would my name be?

109
00:04:11,932 --> 00:04:14,566
Oh, and keep in mind,
Alan Harper's already taken.

110
00:04:15,401 --> 00:04:18,103
Ooh! H-How about
Derek Slade?

111
00:04:18,105 --> 00:04:20,022
Uh, that's a
little gay.

112
00:04:20,024 --> 00:04:22,791
Um... Preston Burbank?

113
00:04:22,793 --> 00:04:25,644
That's just gay from
a different decade.

114
00:04:25,646 --> 00:04:27,613
Um... Joey Proccosini.

115
00:04:27,615 --> 00:04:29,615
Sounds like the
guy that made

116
00:04:29,617 --> 00:04:32,351
Preston Burbank
his prison bitch.

117
00:04:32,353 --> 00:04:33,552
Oh, uh-uh,

118
00:04:33,554 --> 00:04:35,087
how about your porn name?

119
00:04:35,089 --> 00:04:36,537
My porn name?

120
00:04:36,562 --> 00:04:37,290
You know, when you
want to know

121
00:04:37,291 --> 00:04:39,174
what your name would be
as a porn star,

122
00:04:39,176 --> 00:04:41,043
you use the name
of your first pet,

123
00:04:41,045 --> 00:04:42,544
and the street you grew up on.

124
00:04:42,546 --> 00:04:46,431
Unfortunately, I would be
Rusty Knob.

125
00:04:46,433 --> 00:04:49,368
Mine would be
Snowball Honeysuckle.

126
00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:50,669
That would be a great porn name

127
00:04:50,671 --> 00:04:53,639
if Disney Channel started
making adult movies.

128
00:04:53,641 --> 00:04:56,191
No. It needs
to be simple,

129
00:04:56,193 --> 00:04:57,893
like something
easy to believe.

130
00:04:57,895 --> 00:04:59,361
John Doe.

131
00:04:59,363 --> 00:05:00,612
No, it's too simple.

132
00:05:00,614 --> 00:05:01,680
Bob Doe.

133
00:05:01,682 --> 00:05:03,115
No.

134
00:05:03,117 --> 00:05:06,118
It's got to be, like,
right down the middle.

135
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:08,403
You know,
like... Sam.

136
00:05:08,405 --> 00:05:11,173
Doe.

137
00:05:11,175 --> 00:05:14,126
Wilson.
Sam Wilson.

138
00:05:14,128 --> 00:05:16,878
Really? There's got to be, like,
a million Sam Wilsons.

139
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:19,364
No, exactly. I-I can
get lost in a crowd.

140
00:05:19,366 --> 00:05:21,700
Somebody Googles me, they'll
get a butt-load of responses.

141
00:05:21,702 --> 00:05:25,887
Same thing happens
if you Google "Rusty Knob."

142
00:05:25,889 --> 00:05:27,889
Just FYI: do not
hit "Images."

143
00:05:27,891 --> 00:05:30,926
You won't sleep
for a week.

144
00:05:30,928 --> 00:05:34,212
Okay, Sam Wilson,
let's create your life.

145
00:05:34,214 --> 00:05:35,263
Male.

146
00:05:35,265 --> 00:05:37,399
Straight.

147
00:05:37,401 --> 00:05:39,751
Single.

148
00:05:39,753 --> 00:05:41,937
1/8 Apache Indian.

149
00:05:43,055 --> 00:05:45,890
Mix it up a little.

150
00:05:49,345 --> 00:05:51,480
How have I never
heard of this place?

151
00:05:51,482 --> 00:05:54,216
I mean, where else can you buy
pants, shoes, lettuce,

152
00:05:54,218 --> 00:05:56,017
and a garden weasel
under one roof?

153
00:05:56,019 --> 00:05:57,285
It gets better.

154
00:05:57,287 --> 00:05:59,788
On your way out,
you can get a flu shot

155
00:05:59,790 --> 00:06:02,073
and a set of tires
at the same price.

156
00:06:02,075 --> 00:06:03,408
This is...
all right,

157
00:06:03,410 --> 00:06:06,428
what would a down-on-his-luck
Sam Wilson wear?

158
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:09,715
Oh! Maybe something fringed
to reflect his Indian heritage.

159
00:06:11,217 --> 00:06:13,585
He's not joining
the Village People.

160
00:06:13,587 --> 00:06:15,971
Wait, check this out!

161
00:06:15,973 --> 00:06:18,089
A dozen socks for $2.49.

162
00:06:18,091 --> 00:06:21,443
That's 20 cents a pair.
That's ten cents a sock!

163
00:06:21,445 --> 00:06:23,195
I'm so getting these.

164
00:06:23,197 --> 00:06:25,096
But you don't wear socks.

165
00:06:25,098 --> 00:06:27,599
Well, at these prices
I can't afford not to.

166
00:06:27,601 --> 00:06:29,201
All right, looks like
you're getting

167
00:06:29,203 --> 00:06:31,737
the hang of this place.
So, if you'll excuse me,

168
00:06:31,739 --> 00:06:34,222
I have a dentist appointment
on aisle 3.

169
00:06:34,224 --> 00:06:37,459
Don't forget to floss
on aisle 2.

170
00:06:38,594 --> 00:06:42,230
A leather jacket for $49.99?

171
00:06:42,232 --> 00:06:43,949
Come to Papa.

172
00:06:47,119 --> 00:06:48,470
Whoa!

173
00:06:48,472 --> 00:06:49,788
Sorry.

174
00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:51,389
Yeah, hang on.
Let me just...

175
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:53,708
The jacket's on a leash.

176
00:06:53,710 --> 00:06:55,460
I'll just unlock
the security cable here.

177
00:06:55,462 --> 00:06:57,179
Okay, that's better.

178
00:06:57,181 --> 00:07:00,065
That looks really
good on you.

179
00:07:00,067 --> 00:07:02,150
I bet you've said that before.

180
00:07:02,152 --> 00:07:03,685
About 80 times a day, but...

181
00:07:03,687 --> 00:07:05,570
this is the first time
I've meant it.

182
00:07:05,572 --> 00:07:07,022
Yeah, it's nice, but I...

183
00:07:07,024 --> 00:07:09,991
I probably shouldn't. I mean,
for the price of this jacket,

184
00:07:09,993 --> 00:07:11,910
I can buy 240 pairs of socks.

185
00:07:11,912 --> 00:07:14,663
And your Christmas shopping is done.

186
00:07:14,665 --> 00:07:17,449
Act surprised when you open them.

187
00:07:17,451 --> 00:07:19,818
Yeah, actually, I need to buy
a little bit of everything.

188
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:21,620
Okay, I can help you out
with that.

189
00:07:21,622 --> 00:07:24,206
I appreciate it... Kate.

190
00:07:24,208 --> 00:07:26,658
Not a problem.

191
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:29,427
Sam... Sam Wilson.

192
00:07:29,429 --> 00:07:30,712
All right, Sam Wilson.

193
00:07:30,714 --> 00:07:33,348
Um, how about we
start with some...

194
00:07:33,350 --> 00:07:34,883
corduroy pants?

195
00:07:34,885 --> 00:07:37,669
Eh, I'm not a big fan
of corduroy.

196
00:07:37,671 --> 00:07:39,521
They're on sale,
two for $19.99.

197
00:07:39,523 --> 00:07:41,056
People change.

198
00:07:44,944 --> 00:07:47,646
Anyway, after it got
ripped off on the barbed wire,

199
00:07:47,648 --> 00:07:50,515
we started calling him
"One Nut Johnson."

200
00:07:50,517 --> 00:07:53,034
Uh... that's terrible.

201
00:07:53,036 --> 00:07:54,619
Well, it could have been worse.

202
00:07:54,621 --> 00:07:56,121
An inch to the right,

203
00:07:56,123 --> 00:07:59,024
and he would have been
"No Johnson Johnson."

204
00:07:59,026 --> 00:08:01,993
Um, uh, you know what?
Why don't we change the subject?

205
00:08:01,995 --> 00:08:04,462
So, um, how are things
with your girlfriend?

206
00:08:04,464 --> 00:08:05,764
Pretty good.

207
00:08:05,766 --> 00:08:07,165
We're finally gonna get
some time alone this weekend.

208
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:09,501
Her kids are gonna stay
with their dads.

209
00:08:09,503 --> 00:08:12,053
"Dads"? Plural?

210
00:08:12,055 --> 00:08:15,891
Yeah, well, before me,
she picked some real losers.

211
00:08:15,893 --> 00:08:18,009
Sure, sure. Um, so...

212
00:08:18,011 --> 00:08:21,396
so what's it like,
dating someone with kids?

213
00:08:21,398 --> 00:08:22,848
It's tough.
They're pretty protective.

214
00:08:22,850 --> 00:08:25,750
I mean, I'm the guy
dating their mom.

215
00:08:25,752 --> 00:08:27,051
Makes sense.

216
00:08:27,053 --> 00:08:28,920
But her oldest son's
pretty cool.

217
00:08:28,922 --> 00:08:30,555
He buys me beer.

218
00:08:31,390 --> 00:08:33,692
How old is this woman?

219
00:08:33,694 --> 00:08:36,027
Back off, Dad. She's taken.

220
00:08:36,029 --> 00:08:38,580
No, no, I wasn't... I'm...

221
00:08:38,582 --> 00:08:41,082
You know what?
I'll talk to you later.

222
00:08:41,084 --> 00:08:43,802
Okay. Bye, Dad.
Bye.

223
00:08:43,804 --> 00:08:47,706
Yeah... she picked
a real winner this time.

224
00:08:48,507 --> 00:08:50,508
Check it out.

225
00:08:57,016 --> 00:08:58,350
Whoa!

226
00:08:58,352 --> 00:09:00,685
You look like me
when I Photoshop my head

227
00:09:00,687 --> 00:09:02,721
on your body—
I've never done that.

228
00:09:02,723 --> 00:09:06,090
Head to toe, including
undergarments: $32.

229
00:09:06,894 --> 00:09:09,594
Plus the haircut: $232.

230
00:09:09,596 --> 00:09:11,696
Nice.
Oh!

231
00:09:11,698 --> 00:09:13,365
Check this out.

232
00:09:15,101 --> 00:09:17,035
Velcro. Very classy.

233
00:09:17,037 --> 00:09:18,203
It's got a change pouch.

234
00:09:18,205 --> 00:09:20,405
Ooh, you got the deluxe model.

235
00:09:20,407 --> 00:09:21,957
I still can't believe we both
went to the superstore,

236
00:09:21,959 --> 00:09:23,158
you got a hot date

237
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:24,659
and I got a root canal
on the wrong tooth.

238
00:09:24,661 --> 00:09:29,080
I didn't get a date.
Sam Wilson got a date.

239
00:09:29,082 --> 00:09:32,049
You know what?
Switch watches with me.

240
00:09:32,074 --> 00:09:32,668
Why?

241
00:09:32,669 --> 00:09:34,953
'Cause Sam Wilson doesn't
have a $50,000 watch.

242
00:09:34,955 --> 00:09:37,138
Ah, course.
Here you go.

243
00:09:37,974 --> 00:09:39,140
Casio?

244
00:09:39,142 --> 00:09:41,509
I had this watch
in seventh grade!

245
00:09:41,511 --> 00:09:43,678
So did I.

246
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:44,846
Okay...

247
00:09:44,848 --> 00:09:47,349
Oh, you know what?
We should also switch cars.

248
00:09:47,351 --> 00:09:50,735
Yes! Yes. Oh, and you know
what else we should do?

249
00:09:50,737 --> 00:09:53,154
Uh, you should deposit all
your money in my bank account.

250
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:57,075
Just trying to help
you out, buddy.

251
00:09:57,077 --> 00:09:58,360
Thank you.

252
00:09:58,362 --> 00:09:59,744
Oh, where you taking her?

253
00:09:59,746 --> 00:10:02,697
This, uh, Italian place
in Santa Monica. DiFilipo's.

254
00:10:02,699 --> 00:10:05,083
Oh, you are in luck.
I have a coupon.

255
00:10:06,253 --> 00:10:08,753
Buy one entree,
get one free.

256
00:10:08,755 --> 00:10:12,374
Sweet. Thanks.

257
00:10:12,376 --> 00:10:14,158
And remember, uh, poor guys
don't valet park

258
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,510
unless they're wearing
a red vest.

259
00:10:15,512 --> 00:10:16,544
Got it.

260
00:10:19,382 --> 00:10:20,598
Wow.

261
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:22,717
$50,000.

262
00:10:22,719 --> 00:10:24,836
What is wrong with me

263
00:10:24,838 --> 00:10:27,973
that I want to masturbate
with this on?

264
00:10:34,397 --> 00:10:36,231
Nothing.

265
00:10:41,437 --> 00:10:45,040
For a man on a budget,
this is a little pricey.

266
00:10:45,042 --> 00:10:48,159
Oh, don't worry.
I have a coupon.

267
00:10:48,161 --> 00:10:50,795
Sexy.

268
00:10:52,415 --> 00:10:56,301
So, Sam, tell me about yourself.

269
00:10:57,971 --> 00:10:59,704
There's not much to tell.

270
00:10:59,706 --> 00:11:02,340
Uh, I was born in Iowa.

271
00:11:02,342 --> 00:11:05,176
At age seven, I was taken
away from my parents

272
00:11:05,178 --> 00:11:07,412
and trained to be a
government assassin.

273
00:11:07,414 --> 00:11:09,431
Intriguing.

274
00:11:09,433 --> 00:11:10,715
Oh, it gets better.

275
00:11:10,717 --> 00:11:12,317
It wasn't our government.

276
00:11:13,486 --> 00:11:16,137
And I only found out later,
they weren't my parents.

277
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:19,074
Which made killing them
that much easier.

278
00:11:20,059 --> 00:11:21,092
Tell me about you.

279
00:11:21,094 --> 00:11:23,995
Well, I had
a fairly typical childhood

280
00:11:23,997 --> 00:11:26,448
in Riverside, California

281
00:11:26,450 --> 00:11:29,951
until my parents were killed
by an assassin.

282
00:11:31,253 --> 00:11:33,505
I've spent the rest of my life
tracking him down,

283
00:11:33,507 --> 00:11:36,591
and here we are.

284
00:11:36,593 --> 00:11:37,926
Gulp.
Bang.

285
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:42,080
Well, the Riverside part's true,

286
00:11:42,082 --> 00:11:45,100
and then I spent two years
in New York studying fashion.

287
00:11:45,102 --> 00:11:46,468
Ah.
Then I came out here

288
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:48,019
to design clothes
for the movies.

289
00:11:48,021 --> 00:11:48,853
And how did that go?

290
00:11:48,855 --> 00:11:49,854
I designed this dress

291
00:11:49,856 --> 00:11:51,639
and wore it to the movies.

292
00:11:51,641 --> 00:11:54,526
So the dream is still alive.

293
00:11:54,528 --> 00:11:56,361
Indeed it is.

294
00:11:57,613 --> 00:12:00,264
I got to tell you,
it's refreshing,

295
00:12:00,266 --> 00:12:02,534
talking to someone like you
for a change.

296
00:12:02,536 --> 00:12:04,069
Someone like me?

297
00:12:04,071 --> 00:12:06,988
Yeah, someone who doesn't
take himself too seriously

298
00:12:06,990 --> 00:12:08,990
and who's not constantly
trying to impress me

299
00:12:08,992 --> 00:12:10,575
with how much stuff he's got.

300
00:12:10,577 --> 00:12:12,877
What, so, wait, my coupon
didn't impress you?

301
00:12:14,631 --> 00:12:17,415
Well, I don't
have much stuff.

302
00:12:17,417 --> 00:12:19,050
What you see is
what you get.

303
00:12:19,052 --> 00:12:21,285
And so far
I like what I see.

304
00:12:21,287 --> 00:12:22,654
I like what I see.

305
00:12:27,393 --> 00:12:29,928
Such a shame I'm gonna
have to kill you.

306
00:12:29,930 --> 00:12:32,847
Too late. I already
poisoned your wine.

307
00:12:38,526 --> 00:12:39,659
♪ Men. ♪

308
00:12:39,661 --> 00:12:41,645
Okay, you see the Big Dipper?
Yeah.

309
00:12:41,647 --> 00:12:44,481
All right, you see the
last star on the handle?

310
00:12:44,483 --> 00:12:46,383
Follow that five stars
to the right.

311
00:12:46,385 --> 00:12:48,852
Okay.
Up three.

312
00:12:48,854 --> 00:12:51,755
Got it.
Two to the left and down one.

313
00:12:51,757 --> 00:12:54,791
Uh-huh.
That's my star.

314
00:12:54,793 --> 00:12:57,294
I got it for Christmas
when I was 12 years old.

315
00:12:57,296 --> 00:12:58,378
That's sweet.

316
00:12:58,380 --> 00:12:59,496
Yeah, sure, now.

317
00:12:59,498 --> 00:13:01,531
When I was 12
I wanted a dirt bike.

318
00:13:02,751 --> 00:13:04,367
Can't pop a wheelie
on a star.

319
00:13:09,557 --> 00:13:11,725
I'm kind of glad
your car broke down.

320
00:13:14,045 --> 00:13:16,046
Me, too.

321
00:13:16,048 --> 00:13:18,849
You want to make
a wish on my star?

322
00:13:18,851 --> 00:13:20,433
I already did.

323
00:13:26,407 --> 00:13:28,909
For crying
out loud, Sam,

324
00:13:28,911 --> 00:13:31,394
when you going to buy
a decent car?

325
00:13:35,199 --> 00:13:37,233
Kate, this is
my friend Alan.

326
00:13:37,235 --> 00:13:39,035
Thanks so much
for picking us up.

327
00:13:39,037 --> 00:13:40,737
Yeah, this clown rents
a room from me,

328
00:13:40,739 --> 00:13:42,405
suddenly I'm running
a taxi service.

329
00:13:43,541 --> 00:13:46,543
Yeah, I'm sorry.
My car is a piece of crap.

330
00:13:46,545 --> 00:13:48,712
Of course, I don't do
myself any favors

331
00:13:48,714 --> 00:13:51,915
by never changing
the oil— ever.

332
00:13:53,351 --> 00:13:54,801
Well, I like your car.

333
00:13:54,803 --> 00:13:57,053
Thank you.
Thank you.

334
00:13:58,088 --> 00:14:01,090
Uh, so Sam tells me
you have a beach house.

335
00:14:01,092 --> 00:14:02,976
I do. I do.
It's gorgeous.

336
00:14:02,978 --> 00:14:04,394
Uh,
it very expensive,

337
00:14:04,396 --> 00:14:06,446
but I bought it at the
bottom of the market

338
00:14:06,448 --> 00:14:09,482
and then I sold it and bought it
again at the top of the market

339
00:14:09,484 --> 00:14:11,902
simply because I can.

340
00:14:13,037 --> 00:14:15,538
Well, I'm sure at some point
you'll sell it again

341
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:16,907
and we'll go
our separate ways.

342
00:14:16,909 --> 00:14:19,042
Oh, no, no, no,
I'm gonna die in that house.

343
00:14:19,044 --> 00:14:23,463
Oh, and, uh, that reminds me,
uh, your rent is late again.

344
00:14:23,465 --> 00:14:26,082
Right, I'll have it
for you tomorrow.

345
00:14:26,084 --> 00:14:27,450
Today would be better.

346
00:14:27,452 --> 00:14:29,636
Fine, today.

347
00:14:29,638 --> 00:14:31,004
He's a good kid.

348
00:14:31,006 --> 00:14:33,390
Give you the shirt
off his back.

349
00:14:33,392 --> 00:14:35,675
It's a crappy shirt,
but he'll give it to you.

350
00:14:35,677 --> 00:14:37,560
Oh, oh,

351
00:14:37,562 --> 00:14:38,511
would you look at the time?

352
00:14:38,513 --> 00:14:40,430
It is almost 10:00.

353
00:14:40,432 --> 00:14:41,481
I-I can tell
'cause the, uh,

354
00:14:41,483 --> 00:14:43,066
the big hand is near
the big diamond.

355
00:14:43,068 --> 00:14:44,150
Check it out.

356
00:14:44,152 --> 00:14:45,468
Yeah, it's nice.

357
00:14:45,470 --> 00:14:47,270
Damn right.

358
00:14:49,657 --> 00:14:53,777
So, Kate, Sam tells me
you're poor like him.

359
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,581
I had a really
nice time tonight.

360
00:14:58,583 --> 00:15:00,116
Me, too,

361
00:15:00,118 --> 00:15:02,151
but what's
with this guy Alan?

362
00:15:02,153 --> 00:15:03,954
Oh, I'm sorry.

363
00:15:03,956 --> 00:15:05,655
He recently came
into a lot of money

364
00:15:05,657 --> 00:15:07,991
and he's not really
handling it well.

365
00:15:07,993 --> 00:15:09,592
Not handling it well?

366
00:15:09,594 --> 00:15:11,761
He's a big, fizzy douche.

367
00:15:12,847 --> 00:15:15,015
I mean, the way
he was showing off his car.

368
00:15:15,017 --> 00:15:17,767
Geez, how small is his penis?

369
00:15:18,769 --> 00:15:21,838
Those two things
aren't always related.

370
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:24,024
Okay, I-I don't know, that watch

371
00:15:24,026 --> 00:15:26,843
is definitely overcompensating
for something.

372
00:15:26,845 --> 00:15:28,945
Some people just like
nice stuff,

373
00:15:28,947 --> 00:15:32,115
even people
with really big penises.

374
00:15:32,117 --> 00:15:34,534
Well, everyone likes nice stuff,

375
00:15:34,536 --> 00:15:36,786
but he didn't have to be
such a jackass about it.

376
00:15:36,788 --> 00:15:39,656
I know, but, I mean,
he's helping me out,

377
00:15:39,658 --> 00:15:40,857
letting me live with him.

378
00:15:40,859 --> 00:15:41,958
I get it.

379
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,192
It still doesn't give him
the right

380
00:15:43,194 --> 00:15:44,911
to treat you the way he does.

381
00:15:44,913 --> 00:15:46,296
You should say something.

382
00:15:46,298 --> 00:15:48,298
Oh, I intend to.

383
00:15:49,834 --> 00:15:52,719
You know, before he arrived,

384
00:15:52,721 --> 00:15:54,337
I was about to do something.

385
00:15:54,339 --> 00:15:55,839
So was I.

386
00:15:57,142 --> 00:15:59,009
Come on, Sam!

387
00:15:59,011 --> 00:16:02,562
Time is money, and
you're out of both.

388
00:16:02,564 --> 00:16:05,715
You're right. He's
a big, fizzy douche.

389
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:11,821
Hey, looking good.

390
00:16:13,107 --> 00:16:15,108
Where you going?

391
00:16:15,110 --> 00:16:17,110
Oh, I'm packing a picnic
for me and Kate.

392
00:16:17,112 --> 00:16:19,395
We're going to a free concert
in the park.

393
00:16:19,397 --> 00:16:21,197
It's a Van Halen tribute band.

394
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:22,749
Well, actually,
it's not a band.

395
00:16:22,751 --> 00:16:24,868
It's just a guy named Dan Halen.

396
00:16:24,870 --> 00:16:27,420
Unbelievable. You're having fun
living my life.

397
00:16:27,422 --> 00:16:29,005
I've never had that experience.

398
00:16:29,007 --> 00:16:30,540
Well, it's all
because of Kate.

399
00:16:30,542 --> 00:16:31,875
And the best part is,

400
00:16:31,877 --> 00:16:33,009
she likes me for me.

401
00:16:33,011 --> 00:16:35,678
Uh, technically,
she likes you for me.

402
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:38,932
Which is ironic 'cause
she doesn't like you at all.

403
00:16:38,934 --> 00:16:41,017
So, uh, what's the plan here?

404
00:16:41,019 --> 00:16:42,251
What do you mean?

405
00:16:42,253 --> 00:16:43,636
Well, I mean, this girl's been
dating Sam Wilson

406
00:16:43,638 --> 00:16:44,921
for a couple of weeks.

407
00:16:44,923 --> 00:16:46,923
When are you going to
introduce her to Walden Schmidt?

408
00:16:46,925 --> 00:16:48,391
I don't know.

409
00:16:48,393 --> 00:16:49,692
Haven't really thought
that far ahead.

410
00:16:49,694 --> 00:16:51,978
Actually, I'm kind of afraid
to think that far ahead.

411
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:53,229
How long do you think

412
00:16:53,231 --> 00:16:54,597
you can keep up this Prince
and the Pauper charade?

413
00:16:54,599 --> 00:16:56,699
How long do you think you can
keep living here for free?

414
00:16:56,701 --> 00:16:58,568
Godspeed, Sam Wilson.

415
00:17:00,437 --> 00:17:01,771
♪ Men.

416
00:17:04,242 --> 00:17:05,875
Well, that was fun on a budget.

417
00:17:05,877 --> 00:17:07,327
Mm.

418
00:17:07,329 --> 00:17:10,880
Yeah, we certainly got more
bang for our buck, didn't we?

419
00:17:13,585 --> 00:17:15,835
Oh. I'm sorry. I just...

420
00:17:15,837 --> 00:17:17,053
Oh.

421
00:17:18,890 --> 00:17:20,807
Ah, great.

422
00:17:20,809 --> 00:17:21,925
Everything okay?

423
00:17:21,927 --> 00:17:23,309
Yeah. Alan wants me

424
00:17:23,311 --> 00:17:25,728
to pick up some hemorrhoid cream
on the way home.

425
00:17:25,730 --> 00:17:27,814
Well, he is a
pain in the ass.

426
00:17:30,352 --> 00:17:32,468
He's not that bad.

427
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:34,804
Oh, yeah? Then why don't
we ever spend the night

428
00:17:34,806 --> 00:17:36,189
at his Malibu
beach house?

429
00:17:36,191 --> 00:17:38,658
He doesn't like it
when I have guests.

430
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:40,577
Douche.

431
00:17:42,813 --> 00:17:43,863
You should move out.

432
00:17:43,865 --> 00:17:45,481
Can't afford to.

433
00:17:45,483 --> 00:17:48,785
Well, um,

434
00:17:48,787 --> 00:17:50,987
maybe you could crash here.

435
00:17:52,656 --> 00:17:54,657
What... what are you saying,

436
00:17:54,659 --> 00:17:57,177
like... move in?

437
00:17:57,179 --> 00:18:00,597
Yeah, just until you have enough
money to afford your own place.

438
00:18:00,599 --> 00:18:02,715
That might be a while.

439
00:18:02,717 --> 00:18:05,334
I knew I shouldn't have bought
that Dan Halen T-shirt.

440
00:18:07,672 --> 00:18:09,889
So, what, we'd be,
like, roommates?

441
00:18:09,891 --> 00:18:11,141
With benefits.

442
00:18:11,143 --> 00:18:13,059
Oh. I like the sound
of benefits.

443
00:18:13,061 --> 00:18:15,395
Good, 'cause they include
washing the dishes

444
00:18:15,397 --> 00:18:17,013
and taking out the trash.

445
00:18:17,015 --> 00:18:21,017
Okay, clearly we differ
in our definition of "benefits."

446
00:18:23,121 --> 00:18:25,155
Can I think about it?

447
00:18:25,157 --> 00:18:26,823
By all means.

448
00:18:31,912 --> 00:18:34,047
Mmm.

449
00:18:34,049 --> 00:18:36,032
Okay, I got to tell you,

450
00:18:36,034 --> 00:18:38,084
you are much better kisser
than Alan.

451
00:18:43,307 --> 00:18:45,792
Are you sure about this?
Mm.

452
00:18:45,794 --> 00:18:48,895
It's like Dan Halen says,
"Might as well jump."

453
00:18:48,897 --> 00:18:51,431
Well, when are
you coming back?

454
00:18:51,433 --> 00:18:53,008
I don't know.

455
00:18:53,033 --> 00:18:54,518
Walden, have you really
thought this through?

456
00:18:54,519 --> 00:18:57,737
I know it's crazy, but I got to
see where this goes with Kate.

457
00:18:57,739 --> 00:19:00,773
All right, I'm just concerned
about my friend.

458
00:19:00,775 --> 00:19:02,942
I appreciate that.

459
00:19:02,944 --> 00:19:03,993
I'm gonna be fine.

460
00:19:03,995 --> 00:19:05,528
Mm. Good luck.

461
00:19:05,530 --> 00:19:07,146
And, uh, don't worry
about anything here.

462
00:19:07,148 --> 00:19:08,481
Yeah. Thanks, buddy.

463
00:19:08,483 --> 00:19:10,617
Well, bye.
Bye.

464
00:19:11,952 --> 00:19:14,587
Finally, you're mine!
You're all mine!

465
00:19:14,589 --> 00:19:17,373
♪ Men.

466
00:19:18,709 --> 00:19:19,859
♪ Men.

467
00:19:19,861 --> 00:19:22,646
So my porn name would be
Snowball Honeysuckle.

468
00:19:24,165 --> 00:19:25,665
Oh, that is so cute.

469
00:19:25,667 --> 00:19:27,934
I would download every
one of your films.

470
00:19:27,936 --> 00:19:29,602
What would yours be?

471
00:19:29,604 --> 00:19:32,906
Beebo Eighty-ninth Street.

472
00:19:32,908 --> 00:19:35,141
Guess it's not a foolproof system.
Mm.

473
00:19:36,310 --> 00:19:37,610
Hey, I have
to ask you a question.

474
00:19:37,612 --> 00:19:39,479
He was a fish.

475
00:19:39,481 --> 00:19:41,681
Thanks, but no.

476
00:19:41,683 --> 00:19:45,652
Um... why are you with me?

477
00:19:45,654 --> 00:19:47,654
What kind of a
question is that?

478
00:19:47,656 --> 00:19:51,541
I don't know. Just,
I don't have much to offer,

479
00:19:51,543 --> 00:19:55,512
and a beautiful,
smart girl like you

480
00:19:55,514 --> 00:19:57,330
could probably get
any guy she wants.

481
00:19:57,332 --> 00:19:59,415
But I did get
the guy I want.

482
00:19:59,417 --> 00:20:00,817
Good answer.

483
00:20:02,254 --> 00:20:04,754
Just promise
me one thing.

484
00:20:04,756 --> 00:20:06,641
What's that?

485
00:20:06,666 --> 00:20:08,666
That we're always
honest with each other.

486
00:20:10,544 --> 00:20:13,496
No secrets, no lies.

487
00:20:16,834 --> 00:20:19,002

00:20:21,188 --> 00:20:23,222
Good night, Kate.

489
00:20:23,224 --> 00:20:25,391
Good night, Sam.

490
00:20:33,968 --> 00:20:35,919

491
00:20:35,921 --> 00:20:37,704
