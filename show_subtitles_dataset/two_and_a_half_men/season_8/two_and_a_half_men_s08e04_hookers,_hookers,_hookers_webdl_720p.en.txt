00:00:01,313 --> 00:00:03,907
Previously on
two and a half men:
Alan?

2
00:00:03,917 --> 00:00:07,393
Lindsey and I have decided to
live together.

3
00:00:08,125 --> 00:00:09,764
End of an era,
huh, Charlie?

4
00:00:09,946 --> 00:00:12,606
From now on,
no brother, no nephew.

5
00:00:13,131 --> 00:00:14,657
Just the sounds of the ocean

6
00:00:15,009 --> 00:00:16,632
punctuated by the soft voices

7
00:00:16,827 --> 00:00:20,030
of prostitutes lying about
the enormity of my sexual organ.

8
00:00:20,124 --> 00:00:21,874
Alan, dinner's
on the table!

9
00:00:21,875 --> 00:00:24,693
Hey, I noticed this
old pipe on the mantel.

10
00:00:24,762 --> 00:00:25,762
It's a beauty.

11
00:00:25,763 --> 00:00:27,046
Oh, it was my grandfather's.

12
00:00:27,047 --> 00:00:29,065
Oh, wow, they don't make 'em
like this anymore.

13
00:00:29,066 --> 00:00:30,233
So now that he's gone,

14
00:00:30,234 --> 00:00:32,218
what are you gonna do
with that empty room?

15
00:00:32,219 --> 00:00:34,321
Uh... why do you ask?

16
00:00:34,322 --> 00:00:36,556
I was just thinking,
it might be nice

17
00:00:36,557 --> 00:00:40,560
to spend the occasional
weekend here on the beach.

18
00:00:40,561 --> 00:00:42,662
Well, from now on,
this house is your home.

19
00:00:45,212 --> 00:00:48,712
— Sync, corrected by elderman —

20
00:00:51,839 --> 00:00:54,174
Do you smell something burning?

21
00:01:00,898 --> 00:01:03,100
? Men. ?

22
00:01:03,101 --> 00:01:07,104
Whoo, what a day.

23
00:01:07,105 --> 00:01:08,105
Mmm-hmm.

24
00:01:08,106 --> 00:01:11,241
Who could've seen
this one coming?

25
00:01:15,947 --> 00:01:18,582
Oh, please— after
seven years, you know,

26
00:01:18,583 --> 00:01:20,117
I finally move out
of your house,

27
00:01:20,118 --> 00:01:23,236
and within two days,
I burn my new home down.

28
00:01:23,237 --> 00:01:26,590
You can't write
this stuff.

29
00:01:26,591 --> 00:01:32,179
I could if I used your skin for
paper and your blood for ink.

30
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:34,714
I just want you to know that as
soon as we get

31
00:01:34,715 --> 00:01:36,349
the insurance money and repair
the fire damage,

32
00:01:36,350 --> 00:01:38,969
Lyndsey and the boys and I will
be out of your hair for good.

33
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:41,254
Unless, of course, you burn her
house down again.

34
00:01:41,255 --> 00:01:43,390
Funny.

35
00:01:43,391 --> 00:01:47,227
See? That's what we need at
times like this— laughter.

36
00:01:50,698 --> 00:01:53,900
I'm gonna take that as laughter!

37
00:01:53,901 --> 00:01:56,769
Trust me, Eldridge is
a great kid,

38
00:01:56,770 --> 00:01:58,538
and you're
gonna love Lyndsey.

39
00:01:58,539 --> 00:02:01,074
If you can open up
your mind just a little,

40
00:02:01,075 --> 00:02:03,260
you will really enjoy
having them here.

41
00:02:03,261 --> 00:02:05,645
Damn it, Eldridge!
Why the hell did you try

42
00:02:05,646 --> 00:02:07,480
to flush a washcloth down
the toilet?

43
00:02:07,481 --> 00:02:09,949
I'm not enjoying it yet, Alan.

44
00:02:09,950 --> 00:02:11,968
Charlie, you got a mop?

45
00:02:11,969 --> 00:02:13,553
Laundry room.
Thank you.

46
00:02:13,554 --> 00:02:14,638
Need any help, sweetie?

47
00:02:14,639 --> 00:02:16,789
No, but if I need my house
burned down again,

48
00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:18,124
I'll let you know.

49
00:02:18,125 --> 00:02:19,509
See? She is keeping

50
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:22,629
a sense of humor about it.

51
00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:25,065
You've ruined my entire life,
you know that?

52
00:02:25,066 --> 00:02:27,484
You're right, I like her.

53
00:02:27,485 --> 00:02:29,252
We've got a lot in common.

54
00:02:41,192 --> 00:02:43,193
What do you want me
to tell you, Chris?

55
00:02:43,194 --> 00:02:44,561
If you want to see your son,

56
00:02:44,562 --> 00:02:46,063
you're gonna have
to come to Malibu.

57
00:02:46,064 --> 00:02:47,197
Oh, grow up!

58
00:02:47,198 --> 00:02:49,399
You think I planned
to have the house burn down?

59
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,400
It was an accident!

60
00:02:50,401 --> 00:02:53,570
It was, you know.

61
00:02:53,571 --> 00:02:54,788
Drop dead!

62
00:02:56,273 --> 00:02:59,793
Whoo, I'd say she's
a little miffed with your dad.

63
00:02:59,794 --> 00:03:01,662
I'd say she wants to
tear him a new one.

64
00:03:01,663 --> 00:03:03,497
Hey! watch your language.

65
00:03:03,498 --> 00:03:04,948
What'd I say?

66
00:03:04,949 --> 00:03:06,783
New one.

67
00:03:06,784 --> 00:03:08,952
Mmm, honey, honey,

68
00:03:08,953 --> 00:03:10,971
uh, just a little heads up,

69
00:03:10,972 --> 00:03:12,806
um, the boys could
hear you out there.

70
00:03:12,807 --> 00:03:15,125
I don't give a rat's ass
what they can hear!

71
00:03:15,126 --> 00:03:19,513
His father's a jerk and you
burned down my freakin' house!

72
00:03:19,514 --> 00:03:21,431
Our house.

73
00:03:21,432 --> 00:03:23,967
Dear God, stop talking.

74
00:03:29,407 --> 00:03:30,741
Aw, damn!

75
00:03:31,642 --> 00:03:32,693
Hey, Berta.

76
00:03:32,694 --> 00:03:34,144
Bet you're surprised
to see me back.

77
00:03:34,145 --> 00:03:37,447
It's my own fault.
I let myself believe.

78
00:03:37,448 --> 00:03:39,950
Well, I want you to meet
my girlfriend Lyndsey.

79
00:03:39,951 --> 00:03:41,368
And this is her son Eldridge.

80
00:03:41,369 --> 00:03:43,754
And they're gonna be staying
with us for a little while.

81
00:03:43,755 --> 00:03:46,590
What'd he do, burn down
your house?

82
00:03:48,659 --> 00:03:50,794
It was an accident!

83
00:03:54,966 --> 00:03:56,099
Hello, everyone.

84
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:58,769
I hope you all slept well.

85
00:03:58,770 --> 00:04:00,003
If there's anything I can do

86
00:04:00,004 --> 00:04:01,388
to make your stay here
more comfortable,

87
00:04:01,389 --> 00:04:02,606
please be sure to tell me.

88
00:04:02,607 --> 00:04:04,558
Thank you, Charlie.
That is so...

89
00:04:04,559 --> 00:04:06,393
Uh! He doesn't mean it.

90
00:04:08,096 --> 00:04:08,979
Hey, Uncle Charlie?

91
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:09,846
Yeah?

92
00:04:09,847 --> 00:04:11,148
You miss me?

93
00:04:15,486 --> 00:04:17,954
He missed me.

94
00:04:19,957 --> 00:04:22,192
? Men. ?

95
00:04:23,244 --> 00:04:26,496
Honestly, I don't see why
you can't live here.

96
00:04:27,749 --> 00:04:29,365
You're kidding, right?

97
00:04:29,366 --> 00:04:30,434
There's no roof.

98
00:04:30,435 --> 00:04:32,252
So wear a hat.

99
00:04:33,137 --> 00:04:36,539
My great grandmother's
candlesticks.

100
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:38,475
Oh, Lyndsey, I'm sorry.

101
00:04:38,476 --> 00:04:40,343
She smuggled these
out of Denmark

102
00:04:40,344 --> 00:04:41,428
when the Nazis invaded.

103
00:04:41,429 --> 00:04:43,213
Really? Where'd she hide 'em?

104
00:04:43,214 --> 00:04:44,815
Charlie,
don't go there.

105
00:04:44,816 --> 00:04:46,382
Oh, like I'm the only one?

106
00:04:46,383 --> 00:04:48,769
Look at the bright side.

107
00:04:48,770 --> 00:04:50,520
Even though we've lost
some material items,

108
00:04:50,521 --> 00:04:52,739
the important thing is
we're all safe

109
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:54,241
and we've still got
each other, right.

110
00:04:54,242 --> 00:04:57,227
You're making
my skin crawl.

111
00:04:57,228 --> 00:04:59,946
Hey, guys... smile.

112
00:05:00,665 --> 00:05:02,499
It's for your Christmas card.

113
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:05,368
All my stuff is wrecked.

114
00:05:05,369 --> 00:05:06,203
Oh, I'm sorry, buddy.

115
00:05:06,204 --> 00:05:07,621
Sorry isn't gonna bring back

116
00:05:07,622 --> 00:05:08,872
my guitar or my X-Box

117
00:05:08,873 --> 00:05:11,024
or the history paper
that's due tomorrow

118
00:05:11,025 --> 00:05:12,959
that I totally had finished.

119
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,127
Where's Eldridge?

120
00:05:14,128 --> 00:05:16,229
He's drying out his weed
in the backyard.

121
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:17,547
Weed?

122
00:05:17,548 --> 00:05:19,516
Wii.

123
00:05:19,517 --> 00:05:20,583
Nintendo Wii.

124
00:05:20,584 --> 00:05:22,018
I better go help him.

125
00:05:23,104 --> 00:05:26,189
I could use a little
Wii right now.

126
00:05:28,309 --> 00:05:30,760
Is this my Armani jacket?

127
00:05:30,761 --> 00:05:32,395
Oh! Oh, yeah. You know,

128
00:05:32,396 --> 00:05:34,481
I don't know how that got in
with my things.

129
00:05:34,482 --> 00:05:35,732
I was gonna bring it back.

130
00:05:35,733 --> 00:05:36,783
But now that you're here,

131
00:05:36,784 --> 00:05:38,485
why don't you just take it
with you?

132
00:05:38,486 --> 00:05:39,569
Saves me the trip.

133
00:05:39,570 --> 00:05:42,072
You know what? Happy birthday.

134
00:05:44,075 --> 00:05:45,325
Not much of a birthday present.

135
00:05:45,326 --> 00:05:47,443
Ding-dong.

136
00:05:47,444 --> 00:05:49,162
Hi, neighbor.

137
00:05:49,163 --> 00:05:50,580
We saw your cars
out front.

138
00:05:50,581 --> 00:05:51,748
Hey, Judith.

139
00:05:51,749 --> 00:05:53,116
Incredible, huh?

140
00:05:53,117 --> 00:05:56,286
Wow, this place is a wreck.

141
00:05:56,287 --> 00:05:58,889
But still livable.

142
00:06:01,425 --> 00:06:02,893
What are you gonna do?

143
00:06:02,894 --> 00:06:04,644
Well, till the place gets
fixed up,

144
00:06:04,645 --> 00:06:06,429
we're all staying in Malibu
with Charlie.

145
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:08,014
Really?

146
00:06:08,015 --> 00:06:09,182
All of you...

147
00:06:09,183 --> 00:06:11,735
at Charlie's?
What are you
smiling about?

148
00:06:11,736 --> 00:06:14,604
You know what
I'm smiling about.

149
00:06:14,605 --> 00:06:16,690
Well, I hope
the repairs go quickly

150
00:06:16,691 --> 00:06:18,692
so we get you back here
real soon.

151
00:06:18,693 --> 00:06:19,976
Thanks. I'm gonna miss

152
00:06:19,977 --> 00:06:21,745
your friendly face
every morning

153
00:06:21,746 --> 00:06:22,979
when I'm getting the paper.

154
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:24,147
Every morning?

155
00:06:24,148 --> 00:06:25,448
Our schedules synch up

156
00:06:25,449 --> 00:06:27,317
when I'm doing my power walk.

157
00:06:30,821 --> 00:06:32,255
Power walk?

158
00:06:32,256 --> 00:06:33,673
What are you
smiling about?

159
00:06:33,674 --> 00:06:35,208
You know what I'm smiling about.

160
00:06:36,761 --> 00:06:39,662
Hey! My pipe survived!

161
00:06:39,663 --> 00:06:41,331
It's like a miracle.

162
00:06:43,667 --> 00:06:46,303
Filthy habit.

163
00:06:48,055 --> 00:06:51,041
? Men. ?

164
00:06:51,042 --> 00:06:55,378
Oh, look, look, look—
The Towering Inferno is on.

165
00:07:00,017 --> 00:07:02,319
No?

166
00:07:04,205 --> 00:07:08,291
Oh! Stephen King's Firestarter.

167
00:07:09,794 --> 00:07:11,411
No?

168
00:07:11,412 --> 00:07:13,930
All right.

169
00:07:16,133 --> 00:07:20,003
How about Blazing Saddles?

170
00:07:23,925 --> 00:07:25,425
Too soon?

171
00:07:25,426 --> 00:07:27,894
You guys are no fun.

172
00:07:27,895 --> 00:07:29,930
I'm gonna call a hooker.

173
00:07:29,931 --> 00:07:33,066
Charlie, there's two
young boys in the house.

174
00:07:33,067 --> 00:07:34,684
Let 'em get their own hookers.

175
00:07:34,685 --> 00:07:36,486
Charlie, for God's sake.

176
00:07:36,487 --> 00:07:38,305
Don't worry.
I'm a responsible uncle.

177
00:07:38,306 --> 00:07:39,606
That's nice to know.

178
00:07:39,607 --> 00:07:42,058
I promise I'll get
a quiet prostitute.

179
00:07:42,059 --> 00:07:43,243
Believe it or not,

180
00:07:43,244 --> 00:07:44,945
that's a real concession
on his part.

181
00:07:44,946 --> 00:07:48,415
Now where is my phone?

182
00:07:48,416 --> 00:07:50,250
Oh, right, I must've left it in

183
00:07:50,251 --> 00:07:56,172
the charred-but-still-very-
livable remains of your house,

184
00:07:56,173 --> 00:07:57,824
which he burned down.

185
00:07:59,043 --> 00:08:00,910
You're gonna go
over there now?

186
00:08:00,911 --> 00:08:02,929
All my hooker numbers
are in that phone.

187
00:08:02,930 --> 00:08:04,597
So unless
you wanna have sex with me

188
00:08:04,598 --> 00:08:06,850
for $1,000 an hour,
I need the phone.

189
00:08:13,090 --> 00:08:15,925
You don't really think he'd
give me $1,000 an hour?

190
00:08:15,926 --> 00:08:18,712
If I were you, I'd get
the money up front.

191
00:08:21,832 --> 00:08:24,067
? Men. ?

192
00:08:31,909 --> 00:08:35,945
Ah... there we are.

193
00:08:38,115 --> 00:08:41,084
? A-B-C-D-E-F-G-... ?

194
00:08:41,085 --> 00:08:42,385
? H... ?

195
00:08:42,386 --> 00:08:44,787
Hookers.

196
00:08:44,788 --> 00:08:49,092
Hookers, hookers, hookers...

197
00:08:50,177 --> 00:08:53,313
Lookin' for a quiet hooker.

198
00:08:53,314 --> 00:08:56,599
Ah, there we go: "Silent Betty"

199
00:08:58,219 --> 00:09:00,603
Not a lot
of coverage in here.

200
00:09:01,739 --> 00:09:02,906
Who the hell are you?

201
00:09:02,907 --> 00:09:04,274
Who the hell are you?

202
00:09:04,275 --> 00:09:07,527
You're right, let's just stay
mysterious strangers.

203
00:09:07,528 --> 00:09:09,612
This used to be my house,
you know.

204
00:09:11,565 --> 00:09:13,333
You the ex-husband?

205
00:09:13,334 --> 00:09:14,734
Chris MacElroy.

206
00:09:14,735 --> 00:09:15,752
Charlie Harper.

207
00:09:15,753 --> 00:09:18,171
Alan's brother.

208
00:09:18,172 --> 00:09:20,874
I don't usually
admit it, but yeah.

209
00:09:20,875 --> 00:09:23,209
What are you doing here, Chris?

210
00:09:23,210 --> 00:09:26,312
I wanted to see
what the damage was

211
00:09:26,313 --> 00:09:27,514
and just, you know, sit here.

212
00:09:27,515 --> 00:09:31,000
Try and figure out where
it all went wrong.

213
00:09:31,001 --> 00:09:32,719
What'd you come up with?

214
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:36,639
I probably shouldn't have banged
the babysitter.

215
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:39,175
Yeah, that can do it.

216
00:09:40,528 --> 00:09:42,312
I did a babysitter once.

217
00:09:42,313 --> 00:09:44,847
My mom was furious.

218
00:09:46,367 --> 00:09:49,018
Wouldn't drive her home and
absolutely refused to pay her.

219
00:09:49,019 --> 00:09:51,237
Want a drink?

220
00:09:51,238 --> 00:09:53,573
Sure, why not?

221
00:09:55,359 --> 00:09:56,659
To babysitters.

222
00:10:00,531 --> 00:10:02,698
Is this a private party
or can anyone join?

223
00:10:02,699 --> 00:10:05,135
Hey, Herb!
Come on in.

224
00:10:05,136 --> 00:10:07,703
Hey, Chris,
long time no see.

225
00:10:07,704 --> 00:10:10,006
Likewise.
Grab a seat, have a drink.

226
00:10:10,007 --> 00:10:11,758
Oh, gee, I don't know.

227
00:10:11,759 --> 00:10:14,210
I told Judith I was
taking out the garbage.

228
00:10:15,396 --> 00:10:18,314
What the heck. I didn't say
where I was taking it.

229
00:10:22,069 --> 00:10:23,686
So you two guys
know each other?

230
00:10:23,687 --> 00:10:24,771
Oh, you kidding?

231
00:10:24,772 --> 00:10:26,739
Chris is a legend in
this neighborhood.

232
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:28,792
What was she, like, 19?

233
00:10:28,793 --> 00:10:29,826
Twenty-two.

234
00:10:29,827 --> 00:10:31,995
Nevertheless, quite
an accomplishment.

235
00:10:34,398 --> 00:10:36,249
Hey, is she still
babysitting?

236
00:10:37,118 --> 00:10:38,535
'Cause we're looking
for somebody,

237
00:10:38,536 --> 00:10:40,703
and everybody Judith
interviews is fat and ugly.

238
00:10:40,704 --> 00:10:43,940
Take it from me, Herb, you're
better off with fat and ugly.

239
00:10:43,941 --> 00:10:46,793
Oh, I hardly think so.

240
00:10:46,794 --> 00:10:49,045
You'd really be willing

241
00:10:49,046 --> 00:10:51,147
to risk your marriage over
a cute young babysitter?

242
00:10:51,148 --> 00:10:54,801
I certainly wouldn't risk it
over a fat ugly one.

243
00:10:54,802 --> 00:10:57,753
Can't argue with that.

244
00:10:57,754 --> 00:10:59,522
? Men. ?

245
00:11:02,512 --> 00:11:04,313
? Men. ?

246
00:11:04,314 --> 00:11:05,798
I made us a snacky snack.

247
00:11:05,799 --> 00:11:07,316
Swell.

248
00:11:07,317 --> 00:11:10,186
We have onion dip
and cool ranch.

249
00:11:10,187 --> 00:11:11,971
Always good to have
a choice of dips.

250
00:11:11,972 --> 00:11:13,990
And I chose you.

251
00:11:16,026 --> 00:11:18,244
Zing!

252
00:11:20,831 --> 00:11:22,081
What are you doing?

253
00:11:22,082 --> 00:11:24,283
Just gettin' comfy.

254
00:11:24,284 --> 00:11:26,786
Snugglin' up on
the world's best pillow.

255
00:11:26,787 --> 00:11:29,956
Mmm!

256
00:11:37,130 --> 00:11:39,098
Whoa.
That was an accident, right?

257
00:11:39,099 --> 00:11:42,702
Sure...

258
00:11:42,703 --> 00:11:44,854
let's call it an accident.

259
00:11:45,856 --> 00:11:47,940
Hey, can you take me back
to Mom's?
Why?

260
00:11:47,941 --> 00:11:49,308
Eldridge is being a tool.

261
00:11:49,309 --> 00:11:51,944
Whoa!

262
00:11:51,945 --> 00:11:52,979
Dad!

263
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:54,563
It wasn't me, it was...

264
00:11:55,615 --> 00:11:58,183
Yeah, I'll take you
back to your mom's.

265
00:11:58,184 --> 00:11:59,201
Hey, Alan?

266
00:11:59,202 --> 00:12:00,202
What?

267
00:12:00,203 --> 00:12:02,521
Try not to burn down her house.

268
00:12:02,522 --> 00:12:03,823
Yeah, ha-ha.

269
00:12:03,824 --> 00:12:07,126
You might want to light some
matches while I'm gone.

270
00:12:09,846 --> 00:12:11,914
? Men. ?

271
00:12:11,915 --> 00:12:13,716
So, Chris, what're you
up to these days?

272
00:12:13,717 --> 00:12:15,968
Not a lot.
After Lyndsey threw me out,

273
00:12:15,969 --> 00:12:17,920
I lost my job,
started drinking heavily

274
00:12:17,921 --> 00:12:20,423
and I just found out
I have a lump on my groin.

275
00:12:20,424 --> 00:12:23,392
Bad place
for a lump.

276
00:12:23,393 --> 00:12:24,677
Tell me a good place.

277
00:12:24,678 --> 00:12:27,313
Somebody else's groin.

278
00:12:31,018 --> 00:12:32,768
Touché.

279
00:12:34,521 --> 00:12:35,638
Boy, you make one mistake

280
00:12:35,639 --> 00:12:37,723
and you pay for it for the rest
of your life.

281
00:12:37,724 --> 00:12:39,492
You only did
the babysitter once?

282
00:12:39,493 --> 00:12:42,495
Oh, no, that was two years,
morning, noon and night,

283
00:12:42,496 --> 00:12:44,830
but I count it as one mistake.

284
00:12:45,699 --> 00:12:49,401
Maybe that's where
he got the lump.

285
00:12:50,637 --> 00:12:52,571
Did somebody order a pizza?

286
00:12:52,572 --> 00:12:55,875
Hey, it's my favorite pizza boy!

287
00:12:55,876 --> 00:12:57,626
I'm 38 years old, Mr. Harper.

288
00:12:57,627 --> 00:12:59,495
I have high blood pressure
and alimony payments.

289
00:12:59,496 --> 00:13:01,097
You got a lump on your groin?
No.

290
00:13:01,098 --> 00:13:02,581
Then don't complain.

291
00:13:04,101 --> 00:13:05,851
So what are
you people doing here?

292
00:13:05,852 --> 00:13:08,721
Having a lonely drink in memory
of our hopes and dreams

293
00:13:08,722 --> 00:13:10,306
that are now dead and buried.

294
00:13:10,307 --> 00:13:13,092
Oh.

295
00:13:13,093 --> 00:13:14,393
I'm in.

296
00:13:15,946 --> 00:13:18,230
? Men. ?

297
00:13:18,231 --> 00:13:20,199
If it's all the
same to you,

298
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:22,401
I'm gonna stay with
Mom for a little while.

299
00:13:22,402 --> 00:13:23,602
Come on, Jake,

300
00:13:23,603 --> 00:13:25,321
I know it's been
a little rocky lately,

301
00:13:25,322 --> 00:13:26,288
but things'll work out.

302
00:13:26,289 --> 00:13:29,458
Yeah, well, when
they do, call me.

303
00:13:29,459 --> 00:13:31,877
Hey, Mom.
What are you doing here?

304
00:13:31,878 --> 00:13:33,245
What is he he doing here?

305
00:13:33,246 --> 00:13:35,281
He wasn't getting along
with Lyndsey's son.

306
00:13:35,282 --> 00:13:36,348
Maybe that's because

307
00:13:36,349 --> 00:13:38,467
Lyndsey's son is
a degenerate pothead.

308
00:13:38,468 --> 00:13:39,835
He's not so bad.

309
00:13:39,836 --> 00:13:41,203
He just made some
bad choices.

310
00:13:41,204 --> 00:13:43,556
So did his mom.

311
00:13:45,392 --> 00:13:48,844
Yeah, well, you made
the same bad choice she did!

312
00:13:48,845 --> 00:13:51,046
Ha-ha!

313
00:13:57,470 --> 00:13:59,772
So Alan's, like, I don't know,
five, six years old,

314
00:13:59,773 --> 00:14:03,242
and I walk in his bedroom
and he's in there with the dog,

315
00:14:03,243 --> 00:14:05,528
and I start yelling,
"Whoa, whoa, whoa! No, no!

316
00:14:05,529 --> 00:14:06,579
Are you crazy?
Stop that!"

317
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:08,147
Looks up at me
and says "What?"

318
00:14:08,148 --> 00:14:10,249
I say, "Alan,
the dog is supposed

319
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:11,984
to lick the peanut butter
off you."

320
00:14:15,922 --> 00:14:19,258
To this day,
I can't eat peanut butter.

321
00:14:19,259 --> 00:14:20,676
Hello?

322
00:14:20,677 --> 00:14:23,596
Hey, we were
just talking about you.

323
00:14:23,597 --> 00:14:25,548
All good, I hope.

324
00:14:25,549 --> 00:14:27,099
Oh, yeah, it was good.

325
00:14:28,885 --> 00:14:29,802
So, what's going on?

326
00:14:29,803 --> 00:14:30,936
Just having a drink

327
00:14:30,937 --> 00:14:32,388
with a few friends.

328
00:14:32,389 --> 00:14:34,140
Chris, I believe you know
my brother.

329
00:14:34,141 --> 00:14:36,842
The man who's banging your wife
and burned down your house.

330
00:14:37,477 --> 00:14:38,661
Hi.

331
00:14:40,147 --> 00:14:42,448
Pull up a chair.
Have a drink

332
00:14:42,449 --> 00:14:45,067
with your girlfriend's ex
and your wife's new husband.

333
00:14:46,519 --> 00:14:48,120
I just brought the pizza.

334
00:14:48,121 --> 00:14:50,489
I don't think I've slept
with anyone you know.

335
00:14:52,125 --> 00:14:53,742
Okay.

336
00:14:55,078 --> 00:14:57,029
Hey, you know
what I just realized?

337
00:14:57,030 --> 00:15:00,199
You three guys have
all slept with each other.

338
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:02,384
What?
What?
With all due respect, Charlie,

339
00:15:02,385 --> 00:15:03,886
I think I'd remember that.

340
00:15:03,887 --> 00:15:06,555
No, no, think about it.

341
00:15:06,556 --> 00:15:09,208
They say that when you have sex
with someone,

342
00:15:09,209 --> 00:15:10,776
you're basically having sex
with everyone

343
00:15:10,777 --> 00:15:12,194
they've ever had sex with.

344
00:15:12,195 --> 00:15:16,048
Oh. I guess you and I have done
the dirty deed.

345
00:15:17,417 --> 00:15:20,436
Because of Judith,
not the peanut butter dog.

346
00:15:24,291 --> 00:15:25,824
You told them?

347
00:15:25,825 --> 00:15:27,459
I tell everybody.

348
00:15:29,529 --> 00:15:30,529
Wait.

349
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:33,065
So Herb has slept with Alan,

350
00:15:33,066 --> 00:15:35,568
and Alan has slept with Chris,
which means that...

351
00:15:35,569 --> 00:15:37,336
I've slept with Lyndsey!

352
00:15:37,337 --> 00:15:39,989
Yes!

353
00:15:41,458 --> 00:15:44,009
? Men. ?

354
00:15:52,385 --> 00:15:54,186
Hello?

355
00:15:54,187 --> 00:15:57,006
How could you sleep with Herb?

356
00:15:57,007 --> 00:15:58,607
Alan, is that you?

357
00:15:58,608 --> 00:16:00,142
Who's Herb? Where are you?

358
00:16:00,143 --> 00:16:01,927
I'm in our house.

359
00:16:01,928 --> 00:16:03,312
What are you doing there?

360
00:16:03,313 --> 00:16:04,730
Because there's nowhere else

361
00:16:04,731 --> 00:16:07,016
for me to go
'cause you won't forgive me.

362
00:16:07,017 --> 00:16:08,984
Why won't you forgive me?

363
00:16:08,985 --> 00:16:10,536
You're drunk.

364
00:16:10,537 --> 00:16:13,539
Yeah, well, you farted at me.

365
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:15,241
Good-bye, Alan.

366
00:16:16,376 --> 00:16:17,626
Where's Jake?

367
00:16:17,627 --> 00:16:20,946
He left hours ago,
to get away from you.

368
00:16:20,947 --> 00:16:21,880
Where's Alan?

369
00:16:21,881 --> 00:16:24,049
He left to get away
from me.

370
00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:26,919
Where's what's-his-name?

371
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:28,504
The guy who owns
the house?

372
00:16:28,505 --> 00:16:32,341
He left to get away
from all of us.

373
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:37,846
Hey, this is working out
pretty good, huh?

374
00:16:37,847 --> 00:16:41,767
You know,
I envy you guys.

375
00:16:41,768 --> 00:16:44,403
You've all been married,
have kids.

376
00:16:44,404 --> 00:16:46,522
Yeah, it didn't
end well,

377
00:16:46,523 --> 00:16:50,042
but for a moment in time, each
and every one of you experienced

378
00:16:50,043 --> 00:16:52,161
what it is to have a family,

379
00:16:52,162 --> 00:16:55,898
to give and receive
unconditional love.

380
00:16:55,899 --> 00:16:57,566
My marriage isn't over.

381
00:16:57,567 --> 00:17:00,302
Dude, you've been taking out
the garbage

382
00:17:00,303 --> 00:17:02,605
for two-and-a-half hours.

383
00:17:04,474 --> 00:17:08,093
I said it wasn't over,
I didn't say it was good.

384
00:17:09,546 --> 00:17:11,914
Really, Charlie,
you envy us?

385
00:17:11,915 --> 00:17:13,682
Oh, come on, look at me.

386
00:17:13,683 --> 00:17:14,933
What do I have?

387
00:17:14,934 --> 00:17:16,885
A big house on the beach,

388
00:17:16,886 --> 00:17:20,189
more money than I know
what to do with...

389
00:17:20,190 --> 00:17:24,476
and a cell phone full
of candid video of me

390
00:17:24,477 --> 00:17:26,662
having uninhibited sex with
beautiful women

391
00:17:26,663 --> 00:17:29,348
whose names I don't remember.

392
00:17:33,103 --> 00:17:36,789
I don't think
he envies us at all.

393
00:17:36,790 --> 00:17:39,992
Good catch, Herb.

394
00:17:39,993 --> 00:17:41,526
I gotta go pee.

395
00:17:41,527 --> 00:17:43,746
Oh, uh, bathroom's
right back there.

396
00:17:43,747 --> 00:17:46,365
I know where it is!
I used to live here.

397
00:17:46,366 --> 00:17:48,300
Right, right.

398
00:17:48,301 --> 00:17:50,169
That's a classy guy.

399
00:17:50,170 --> 00:17:53,705
Using the toilet in a house
with no plumbing.

400
00:17:53,706 --> 00:17:55,491
Where have you been going?

401
00:17:55,492 --> 00:17:57,142
Refrigerator.

402
00:17:58,578 --> 00:18:00,479
I filled the vegetable crisper.

403
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:03,982
See? That's what I love
about you, Charlie.

404
00:18:03,983 --> 00:18:05,417
You're a maverick.

405
00:18:05,418 --> 00:18:09,221
I gotta start being
more mavericky-ky.

406
00:18:09,222 --> 00:18:12,157
Herb, where the
hell are you?

407
00:18:12,158 --> 00:18:13,992
Maybe tomorrow.

408
00:18:15,662 --> 00:18:18,730
Hey, Lyndsey,
you'll never guess

409
00:18:18,731 --> 00:18:21,533
what we figured out
about you and me.

410
00:18:21,534 --> 00:18:23,735
Herb!
See ya soon.

411
00:18:24,954 --> 00:18:27,072
Alan, let's go home.

412
00:18:27,073 --> 00:18:29,408
You came to get me?

413
00:18:29,409 --> 00:18:30,426
Yeah.

414
00:18:30,427 --> 00:18:31,410
You forgive me?

415
00:18:31,411 --> 00:18:34,346
Well, I thought
about it and...

416
00:18:34,347 --> 00:18:35,414
Hey, Lyndsey.

417
00:18:35,415 --> 00:18:36,515
Chris.

418
00:18:36,516 --> 00:18:37,800
What are you doing here?

419
00:18:37,801 --> 00:18:40,636
Well, I came
to see the damage

420
00:18:40,637 --> 00:18:43,021
and I just started
thinking about us;

421
00:18:43,022 --> 00:18:44,723
what an idiot I was.

422
00:18:44,724 --> 00:18:46,725
You were, you know?

423
00:18:46,726 --> 00:18:49,061
I'd give anything to start over.

424
00:18:49,062 --> 00:18:50,612
Really?

425
00:18:50,613 --> 00:18:54,616
Uh, excuse me, but weren't you
about to forgive me?

426
00:18:54,617 --> 00:18:55,984
Can we go out someplace

427
00:18:55,985 --> 00:18:58,120
and have a cup of coffee
and maybe,

428
00:18:58,121 --> 00:18:59,621
I don't know, just talk?

429
00:18:59,622 --> 00:19:02,791
Babysitter.

430
00:19:04,411 --> 00:19:06,745
Well, I guess

431
00:19:06,746 --> 00:19:08,213
there's nothing
wrong with talking.

432
00:19:08,214 --> 00:19:09,581
That's great.

433
00:19:09,582 --> 00:19:12,134
I can't tell you how much
I've missed you and Eldridge.

434
00:19:12,135 --> 00:19:14,420
He really needs
a father, Chris.

435
00:19:14,421 --> 00:19:17,256
Uh, so I'll see you back
at the house, right?

436
00:19:19,676 --> 00:19:22,995
She left her kid there;
she's gotta come back.

437
00:19:22,996 --> 00:19:25,297
Would you come back
for that kid?

438
00:19:26,933 --> 00:19:29,568
She's never coming back.

439
00:19:32,322 --> 00:19:34,639
? Men. ?

440
00:19:36,827 --> 00:19:38,160
? Men. ?

441
00:19:39,513 --> 00:19:41,798
You know who you
remind me of, Alan?

442
00:19:41,799 --> 00:19:43,383
Job.

443
00:19:43,384 --> 00:19:44,684
Job from the Bible?

444
00:19:44,685 --> 00:19:47,103
How many Jobs you know?

445
00:19:47,104 --> 00:19:50,190
Job— the guy God punishes
just for laughs.

446
00:19:50,191 --> 00:19:52,892
Mm! God punishes Job
to test his faith.

447
00:19:52,893 --> 00:19:54,727
Still funny.

448
00:19:56,597 --> 00:19:57,947
What time is it?

449
00:19:57,948 --> 00:19:59,449
A little after midnight.

450
00:20:01,268 --> 00:20:03,269
So much for that
30-minute guarantee.

451
00:20:03,270 --> 00:20:05,438
Good night, fellas.

452
00:20:05,439 --> 00:20:06,606
Good night, Gordon.

453
00:20:06,607 --> 00:20:07,874
Night, Gordon.

454
00:20:09,610 --> 00:20:12,996
So...

455
00:20:12,997 --> 00:20:15,148
Guess it's just
you and me, huh?

456
00:20:15,149 --> 00:20:18,118
Two guys sitting alone
in a burned-out house.

457
00:20:20,921 --> 00:20:23,423
Hey!

458
00:20:23,424 --> 00:20:25,124
Silent Betty! You made it!

459
00:20:25,125 --> 00:20:27,760
See ya, Alan.

460
00:20:30,631 --> 00:20:34,800
Well, sure,
half and half sounds good.

461
00:20:41,208 --> 00:20:43,143
Huh.

462
00:20:43,144 --> 00:20:44,928
Maybe I am like Job.

463
00:20:48,249 --> 00:20:51,584
But I am not
gonna lose my faith!

464
00:21:01,011 --> 00:21:02,428
Aw, crap.

465
