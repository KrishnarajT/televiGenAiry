I don't know. Probably
just catch up on my reading,

20
00:00:43,299 --> 00:00:44,466
take a walk on the beach,

Except instead of
reading and walking,

25
00:00:49,939 --> 00:00:52,507
I'm going on a date
and hoping to get laid.

26
00:00:52,508 --> 00:00:55,944

I wouldn't just be
hoping to get laid.
Hmm!

31
00:01:04,621 --> 00:01:08,357
So. You're back

00:01:08,358 --> 00:01:09,625
How'd you hook up?

33
00:01:09,626 --> 00:01:10,792
Was it a "meet cute"?

34

Meet... cute?

35
00:01:12,996 --> 00:01:14,630
You know, like, uh,
like in the movies.

36
00:01:14,631 --> 00:01:16,331
She's carrying groceries,
and you bump into her

37
00:01:16,332 --> 00:01:18,400
and she spills them
and you try to help her

38
00:01:18,401 --> 00:01:21,086
pick 'em back up, and you bonk
heads, and she's concerned

39
00:01:21,087 --> 00:01:24,205
she might have a concussion,
so you tell her you're a doctor,

40
00:01:24,206 --> 00:01:26,575
and you keep up the ruse until
after she's fallen in love

41
00:01:26,576 --> 00:01:28,243
with you, at which
point you confess

42
00:01:28,244 --> 00:01:30,112
that you're not the man
she thought you were,

43
00:01:30,113 --> 00:01:32,213
and she's furious and
never wants to talk to you,

44
00:01:32,214 --> 00:01:33,732
but you go to her place of work,

45
00:01:33,733 --> 00:01:35,400
and you make a
complete fool of yourself

46
00:01:35,401 --> 00:01:36,952
by declaring your
undying love for her

47
00:01:36,953 --> 00:01:38,437
during an important
business meeting.

48
00:01:38,438 --> 00:01:41,690
Thankfully, the meeting
is with Japanese bankers

49
00:01:41,691 --> 00:01:43,575
who find you charming.

50
00:01:43,576 --> 00:01:45,160
And they give her
the big account,

51
00:01:45,161 --> 00:01:46,862
after which you scoop
her into your arms

52
00:01:46,863 --> 00:01:49,598
and ask her to marry you, and
you live happily ever after.

53
00:01:52,368 --> 00:01:55,637
In Portland.

54
00:01:56,973 --> 00:01:59,174
Um... no.

55
00:02:00,376 --> 00:02:01,543
She's a dermatologist

56
00:02:01,544 --> 00:02:03,679

59

Uh, her name's Michelle,
and I'm guessing mid-'30s.

00:02:18,294 --> 00:02:21,229
would you show it to her

Sure, I'll pull
it out over dinner.

00:07:11,410 --> 00:07:13,045
I-It's not what it looks like.

180
00:07:13,046 --> 00:07:14,680
Hey, I get it.

181
00:07:14,681 --> 00:07:17,082
You're bored. You're lonely.
You can't afford a hooker.

182
00:07:17,083 --> 00:07:18,984
But come on, keep
it in your room!

183
00:07:18,985 --> 00:07:22,354
Okay, i-in my defense, I wasn't
expecting you home till later.

184
00:07:22,355 --> 00:07:24,890
Plus, it felt a little
naughtier out here.

185
00:07:24,891 --> 00:07:26,558
You know, in public.

186
00:07:26,559 --> 00:07:27,859
You want naughty?

187
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:30,428
Go yank it on the pitcher's
mound at Dodger Stadium.

188
00:07:30,429 --> 00:07:31,763
Ooh, clever.

189
00:07:31,764 --> 00:07:35,651
Seventh-inning stretch.

190
00:07:35,652 --> 00:07:38,654
You realize I now
have to burn the couch.

191
00:07:38,655 --> 00:07:40,105
Well, if you're
going to do that,

192
00:07:40,106 --> 00:07:42,441
you might want to burn
the deck chair, too.

193
00:07:42,442 --> 00:07:44,710
Oh, God, Alan.

194
00:07:44,711 --> 00:07:45,827
So how was
your evening?

195
00:07:45,828 --> 00:07:47,145
Fine.

196
00:07:47,146 --> 00:07:49,214
I thought you were planning
on bringing her back here.

197
00:07:49,215 --> 00:07:52,050
And yet you were twanging
your magic clanger

198
00:07:52,051 --> 00:07:54,285
right in the middle
of the living room.

199
00:07:54,286 --> 00:07:57,255
I lost track of time. Sue me.

200
00:07:57,256 --> 00:07:59,157
So, uh, what went
wrong with your date?

201
00:07:59,158 --> 00:08:00,592
Nothing went wrong.

202
00:08:00,593 --> 00:08:04,096
She's terrific. She's
beautiful. She's smart.

203
00:08:04,097 --> 00:08:05,130
But...?

204
00:08:05,131 --> 00:08:07,065
She's 47.

205
00:08:07,066 --> 00:08:10,068
You said she was
in her mid-'30s.

206
00:08:10,069 --> 00:08:11,470
That's what I thought.

207
00:08:11,471 --> 00:08:12,821
Apparently,
dermatologists

208
00:08:12,822 --> 00:08:17,542
know how to take really
good care of their skin.

209
00:08:17,543 --> 00:08:19,077
Or she's a witch.

210
00:08:19,078 --> 00:08:21,947
I don't understand. You liked
her when you thought she was 35.

211
00:08:21,948 --> 00:08:23,248
What changed?

212
00:08:23,249 --> 00:08:25,984
I found out she's 47.

213
00:08:25,985 --> 00:08:28,420
Oh, come on.
47's just a number.

214
00:08:28,421 --> 00:08:29,621
A big number.

215
00:08:29,622 --> 00:08:31,590
A scary number.

216
00:08:31,591 --> 00:08:34,626
Are you really that
superficial, vain, and shallow?

217
00:08:34,627 --> 00:08:37,379
Yes, yes, and yes.

218
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:40,098
Probably the deepest thing about
me is a little pit on my ass

219
00:08:40,099 --> 00:08:41,767
where a mole used to be.

220
00:08:41,768 --> 00:08:44,169
But fish can swim
in shallow water.

221
00:08:44,170 --> 00:08:46,271
What the hell's that
supposed to mean?

222
00:08:46,272 --> 00:08:50,058
I don't know, I'm a
little dehydrated.

223
00:08:50,059 --> 00:08:51,410
What I'm trying to say

224
00:08:51,411 --> 00:08:54,312
is that it's silly to throw away
a promising relationship

225
00:08:54,313 --> 00:08:55,947
based on an arbitrary number.

226
00:08:55,948 --> 00:09:00,051
It's not arbitrary.
She's really 47.

227
00:09:00,052 --> 00:09:03,789
47! That's like ten
years older than me.

228
00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:06,591
Why do you do that?

229
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,361
I'm your brother.

230
00:09:09,362 --> 00:09:11,763
I know exactly how old you are.

231
00:09:11,764 --> 00:09:14,866
The point is, the minute I
found out she was older than me,

232
00:09:14,867 --> 00:09:16,968
I started looking at her
in a whole different way.

233
00:09:16,969 --> 00:09:18,170
And what way is that?

234
00:09:18,171 --> 00:09:19,838
Like, she's a woman who,

235
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:22,607
when I'm 52, she'll be 60.

236
00:09:22,608 --> 00:09:25,510
You'll be 56.

237
00:09:25,511 --> 00:09:28,580
What are you, the math police?

238
00:09:28,581 --> 00:09:30,315
You know what this is
really about, don't you?

239
00:09:30,316 --> 00:09:34,119
Yeah. When I'm 58,
she'll be 70!

240
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:35,654
You're really going
to keep doing this?

241
00:09:35,655 --> 00:09:37,622
I can't help myself.

242
00:09:37,623 --> 00:09:39,157
Look at it this way:

243
00:09:39,158 --> 00:09:42,894
When she's 70, you're likely
to have been dead for ten years.

244
00:09:42,895 --> 00:09:47,232
Actually, that does make
me feel a little better.

245
00:09:47,233 --> 00:09:48,900
I'll tell you one
thing, Charlie.

246
00:09:48,901 --> 00:09:52,237
I would give anything to find
someone I enjoy being with,

247
00:09:52,238 --> 00:09:53,738
who's close to my own age,

248
00:09:53,739 --> 00:09:55,757
and who I can
really connect with.

249
00:09:55,758 --> 00:09:58,143
Look no further, Alan.

250
00:09:58,144 --> 00:09:59,377
You've found her.

00:10:07,787 --> 00:10:10,489

I didn't think I was ever
going to hear from you again.

255
00:10:16,479 --> 00:10:17,729
Why would you think that?

256
00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:19,831
I don't know— the age thing.

257
00:10:19,832 --> 00:10:22,567
Oh, come on.
It's just a number.

258
00:10:22,568 --> 00:10:23,568
I like you.

259
00:10:23,569 --> 00:10:25,070
I'm attracted to you.

260
00:10:25,071 --> 00:10:26,988
Plus, there's no way anybody
looks at you and thinks,

261
00:10:26,989 --> 00:10:28,907
"This is a
47-year-old woman"

262
00:10:28,908 --> 00:10:30,308

264

That's my daughter.

288
00:11:18,818 --> 00:11:20,318
Sarah and I broke up.

289
00:11:22,121 --> 00:11:24,088
When were you
gonna tell me this?

290
00:11:24,089 --> 00:11:25,423
Mom, I'm 20 years old;

291
00:11:25,424 --> 00:11:27,358
my personal life
is none of your business.

292
00:11:29,962 --> 00:11:32,197
As long as you're my daughter,
it's my business.

293
00:11:32,198 --> 00:11:33,298
Tell me about Jeremy.

294
00:11:33,299 --> 00:11:34,299
What's to tell?

295
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:35,533
He's a nice guy.

296
00:11:35,534 --> 00:11:36,701
He's Sarah's roommate.

297
00:11:36,702 --> 00:11:37,635
Wait a minute.

298
00:11:37,636 --> 00:11:38,720
You broke up
with Sarah

299
00:11:38,721 --> 00:11:40,538
so you could hook up
with her roommate?

300
00:11:40,539 --> 00:11:41,873
No, no.

301
00:11:41,874 --> 00:11:44,576
We were all hooking up together,
but then Sarah got all weird

302
00:11:44,577 --> 00:11:46,110
even though it was her idea.

303
00:11:46,111 --> 00:11:48,513
Don't you just
hate that?

304
00:11:53,085 --> 00:11:55,887
Are you telling me that the
three of you had sex together?

305
00:11:55,888 --> 00:11:57,054
Hey, you're the one who said

306
00:11:57,055 --> 00:11:58,623
I should explore
all my options in life.

307
00:11:58,624 --> 00:12:01,626
I was talking about grad
school, not threesomes!

308
00:12:01,627 --> 00:12:04,128
I'm so sorry you
have to hear this.

309
00:12:04,129 --> 00:12:05,129
No, no, no, it's fine.

310
00:12:05,130 --> 00:12:07,365
Pretend I'm not here.

311
00:12:08,968 --> 00:12:10,468
I also need
to borrow some money.

312
00:12:10,469 --> 00:12:12,003
Shauna, how do you
expect to pay me back?

313
00:12:12,004 --> 00:12:13,104
I still have a job.

314
00:12:13,105 --> 00:12:14,622
A webcam in
your bathroom

315
00:12:14,623 --> 00:12:16,674
and a PayPal account
is not a job!

316
00:12:19,078 --> 00:12:21,246
I admit, it's not
making much money.

317
00:12:21,247 --> 00:12:23,548
But that's because there's
so much free porn out there!

318
00:12:23,549 --> 00:12:24,749
She's got a point.

319
00:12:25,684 --> 00:12:28,353

industry is dying.

00:12:28,354 --> 00:12:30,321
Thank you.
You're welcome.

321
00:12:30,322 --> 00:12:32,957
And if I could
just throw in my two cents here.

322
00:12:32,958 --> 00:12:34,559
Michelle, your
daughter's at that time

323
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,995
in her life where she's got
to make her own choices,

324
00:12:36,996 --> 00:12:38,997
and it doesn't matter if
they're right or wrong.

325
00:12:38,998 --> 00:12:40,298
Either way,
she learns.

326
00:12:40,299 --> 00:12:42,300
But I'm just trying
to protect her.

327
00:12:42,301 --> 00:12:43,668
You can't protect her.

328
00:12:43,669 --> 00:12:46,738
All you can do is love her and
be there for her no matter what.

329
00:12:46,739 --> 00:12:48,940
I am there for her.

330
00:12:48,941 --> 00:12:50,275

331
00:12:50,276 --> 00:12:52,043

334
00:13:01,253 --> 00:13:02,170
I should go.

00:13:02,171 --> 00:13:03,254

I had to.
The pills were about to expire.

Good for you.
Very mature.

401
00:16:15,747 --> 00:16:17,982

406
00:16:25,290 --> 00:16:26,824

Summing up:

408
00:16:28,994 --> 00:16:31,095
a 20-year-old, gorgeous,
bisexual daughter.

409
00:16:31,096 --> 00:16:32,380

If I continue a relationship

course, the fact that

the motivation for the decision
is sordid and despicable.
