1
00:00:03,671 --> 00:00:06,583
All right,
I have turned "it" into "ziti",

2
00:00:07,227 --> 00:00:10,691
with a triple letter on Z
and a double word on the I.

3
00:00:10,816 --> 00:00:13,071
Plus, going down, I've created "za".

4
00:00:15,602 --> 00:00:16,326
Za?

5
00:00:16,687 --> 00:00:18,487
A colloquialism for pizza.

6
00:00:19,537 --> 00:00:23,082
One of five two-letter words accepted
by the National Scrabble Association.

7
00:00:24,899 --> 00:00:25,836
Unbelievable.

8
00:00:26,045 --> 00:00:27,795
You can call them if you want.

9
00:00:29,945 --> 00:00:33,005
That's what we in Scrabble circles
call a two tile takedown.

10
00:00:36,169 --> 00:00:37,682
Alan, is our limo here yet?

11
00:00:37,807 --> 00:00:39,333
Sorry, I haven't seen a limo.

12
00:00:39,458 --> 00:00:40,708
Oh, 100 points!

13
00:00:43,826 --> 00:00:45,438
That's a gorgeous dress, Courtney.

14
00:00:45,607 --> 00:00:48,504
Thanks. Charlie insisted
on buying it for me to wear tonight.

15
00:00:48,629 --> 00:00:51,497
- What's the charity again?
- I don't know. Landmines, orphans.

16
00:00:51,622 --> 00:00:53,222
Landmines for orphans.

17
00:00:53,531 --> 00:00:55,431
I just want to show you off.

18
00:00:56,128 --> 00:00:58,201
- Well, you look great.
- Thank you.

19
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:00,370
No, there's...

20
00:01:01,239 --> 00:01:02,539
Something wrong.

21
00:01:03,082 --> 00:01:03,832
What?

22
00:01:04,288 --> 00:01:06,188
I don't know. Something's...

23
00:01:06,313 --> 00:01:07,627
Something's missing.

24
00:01:07,914 --> 00:01:08,864
I got it.

25
00:01:14,185 --> 00:01:15,635
You shouldn't have.

26
00:01:16,721 --> 00:01:19,500
Well, you've done a lot of things for me
you shouldn't have.

27
00:01:22,333 --> 00:01:23,560
Now you look great.

28
00:01:23,728 --> 00:01:25,278
God, it is beautiful.

29
00:01:26,079 --> 00:01:27,079
Thank you.

30
00:01:40,165 --> 00:01:41,998
What are you up to tonight?

31
00:01:42,123 --> 00:01:44,824
Not much.
Just a quiet, romantic evening at home.

32
00:01:44,949 --> 00:01:45,748
Loser.

33
00:01:48,273 --> 00:01:49,502
Come on, that's not fair.

34
00:01:50,313 --> 00:01:52,255
No, it's my word! Loser.

35
00:01:54,256 --> 00:01:55,466
I should point out

36
00:01:55,682 --> 00:01:58,595
you could have used the C at the top
of the board and made "closer".

37
00:02:00,712 --> 00:02:02,390
I'll stick with loser.

38
00:02:06,411 --> 00:02:08,211
Great. We'll be right out.

39
00:02:08,579 --> 00:02:10,398
- Our chariot awaits.
- Have fun.

40
00:02:10,567 --> 00:02:11,917
Thanks. You, too.

41
00:02:12,258 --> 00:02:13,315
Do me a favor.

42
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:16,299
When we get in the limo,
ask the driver to put up the partition.

43
00:02:16,424 --> 00:02:17,499
You bet.

44
00:02:17,933 --> 00:02:19,130
Isn't that sweet?

45
00:02:19,255 --> 00:02:21,382
She's gonna do more things
she shouldn't.

46
00:02:28,454 --> 00:02:29,954
Gluten-free pretzel?

47
00:02:30,821 --> 00:02:31,961
No, thanks.

48
00:02:32,811 --> 00:02:35,132
I guess this isn't much
of a Saturday night date.

49
00:02:35,795 --> 00:02:38,269
Alan, it's fine.
I like staying in with you.

50
00:02:38,715 --> 00:02:41,265
I could probably do
without the Bom-bom!

51
00:02:43,743 --> 00:02:46,893
I wish I could take you out
and get you things like Charlie does.

52
00:02:47,327 --> 00:02:48,812
I don't need those things.

53
00:02:49,857 --> 00:02:51,407
I mean, they're nice.

54
00:02:52,254 --> 00:02:55,193
They're more than nice.
They're what every girl dreams of.

55
00:02:55,318 --> 00:02:56,558
But let's face it.

56
00:02:56,683 --> 00:02:58,571
Some dreams just have to die.

57
00:03:00,944 --> 00:03:02,909
Well, I'm sorry you had to settle.

58
00:03:04,168 --> 00:03:05,371
I'm not settling.

59
00:03:06,247 --> 00:03:07,204
I'm accepting.

60
00:03:07,329 --> 00:03:10,018
So you're not rich
and successful like Charlie.

61
00:03:10,143 --> 00:03:12,779
So you can't take me out in limos
and shower me in diamonds.

62
00:03:12,904 --> 00:03:15,505
So there's no expensive restaurants
or beautiful dresses.

63
00:03:21,804 --> 00:03:22,513
But?

64
00:03:23,538 --> 00:03:24,288
What?

65
00:03:25,207 --> 00:03:27,065
Well, you know,
I can't take you out,

66
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:30,167
and I can't give you stuff, but...

67
00:03:31,047 --> 00:03:33,398
But... I love you?

68
00:03:35,217 --> 00:03:35,926
Why?

69
00:03:38,727 --> 00:03:41,276
Boy, you're just gonna keep
pushing this, aren't you?

70
00:03:41,401 --> 00:03:42,961
You love me. I'm good.

71
00:03:43,086 --> 00:03:44,586
Let's play Scrabble.

72
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:46,481
Axolotl!

73
00:03:53,253 --> 00:03:56,168
Season 8 Episode 11
"Dead From the Waist Down"

74
00:03:56,293 --> 00:03:59,210
Subtitles: Mr. Bo Jingles Team

75
00:04:05,121 --> 00:04:06,021
Morning.

76
00:04:06,146 --> 00:04:07,046
Morning.

77
00:04:09,598 --> 00:04:10,748
Pottery Barn?

78
00:04:11,825 --> 00:04:14,564
I'm looking for ideas
for a birthday present for Lyndsey.

79
00:04:15,070 --> 00:04:16,570
At the Pottery Barn?

80
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:19,310
Well, I don't have your money.

81
00:04:19,435 --> 00:04:22,905
And you can communicate your feelings
for a woman without diamonds.

82
00:04:23,074 --> 00:04:25,366
True,
but diamonds get you limo skull.

83
00:04:27,737 --> 00:04:30,413
Pottery Barn won't get you dry humped
in the back of a city bus.

84
00:04:31,702 --> 00:04:32,652
Charming.

85
00:04:33,125 --> 00:04:35,460
So, how was the charity soirée
last night?

86
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:38,058
I don't know.
We never made it out of the limo.

87
00:04:39,071 --> 00:04:41,436
Do you have any idea
how bad you're making me look?

88
00:04:41,561 --> 00:04:42,634
That's not me.

89
00:04:42,802 --> 00:04:44,844
That's genetics
and barber school haircuts.

90
00:04:45,393 --> 00:04:48,177
I'm serious. How do you think I feel
when I'm with Lyndsey,

91
00:04:48,302 --> 00:04:50,641
and I see you shower Courtney
with limos and diamonds?

92
00:04:51,578 --> 00:04:53,836
I never thought about that.
I have a solution, though.

93
00:04:53,961 --> 00:04:55,501
- What's that?
- Move out.

94
00:04:56,628 --> 00:05:00,401
I'm just saying, I'd appreciate it
if you didn't do that in front of us.

95
00:05:00,704 --> 00:05:02,028
Again, I have a solution.

96
00:05:02,241 --> 00:05:05,990
Let's stipulate you want me
to move out and I'm not going anywhere.

97
00:05:06,301 --> 00:05:07,782
What is it you'd have me do?

98
00:05:07,907 --> 00:05:11,219
Not enjoy the money that I earn?
Not lavish it on the people I love?

99
00:05:11,344 --> 00:05:13,547
Sneak around in the night
giving gifts to my girlfriend,

100
00:05:13,672 --> 00:05:17,126
- so you don't get your feelings hurt?
- Is that something you'd consider?

101
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:20,588
- No, but I'll tell you what I will do.
- What's that?

102
00:05:20,907 --> 00:05:22,446
If I should come home some night

103
00:05:22,571 --> 00:05:24,835
to find you on a chair
with a rope around your neck

104
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:28,080
because you can't bear another moment
of your pathetic life,

105
00:05:28,205 --> 00:05:30,515
I give you my word,
I will kick the chair.

106
00:05:35,403 --> 00:05:36,968
Santa Claus bottle stopper.

107
00:05:37,093 --> 00:05:38,393
Only 12 dollars.

108
00:05:39,351 --> 00:05:40,751
I can get her two.

109
00:05:44,431 --> 00:05:45,140
Dad?

110
00:05:49,646 --> 00:05:51,796
- I need money.
- Join the club.

111
00:05:52,973 --> 00:05:54,997
Seriously.
My clothes are getting too small.

112
00:05:55,961 --> 00:05:59,965
I give your mother money every month
for the purpose of buying what you need.

113
00:06:00,448 --> 00:06:02,130
That's not how she sees it.

114
00:06:03,593 --> 00:06:06,050
I don't know what to tell you.
Things are tight right now.

115
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:07,560
So are my shoes.

116
00:06:08,116 --> 00:06:10,964
What do you want me to do,
tap into your college fund?

117
00:06:11,089 --> 00:06:12,189
I guess not.

118
00:06:13,392 --> 00:06:14,742
Hang on a second.

119
00:06:16,883 --> 00:06:18,965
Let's not throw that idea out
so quickly.

120
00:06:19,354 --> 00:06:22,110
- What do you mean?
- Well, realistically,

121
00:06:22,235 --> 00:06:25,640
do you actually
see yourself going to college?

122
00:06:25,765 --> 00:06:28,565
Because if you don't,
we could use that money

123
00:06:28,702 --> 00:06:31,659
to buy you some new clothes,
plus maybe some other things.

124
00:06:32,033 --> 00:06:33,616
It's funny that you ask that.

125
00:06:33,788 --> 00:06:36,057
I had no interest in college
until a few days ago.

126
00:06:36,182 --> 00:06:37,165
What changed?

127
00:06:37,333 --> 00:06:40,363
I saw this video called
Topless Coeds of the Big Ten,

128
00:06:40,488 --> 00:06:42,545
and I decided
I need to go to college.

129
00:06:43,594 --> 00:06:46,400
You expect me to pay
30, 40,000 dollars a year

130
00:06:46,525 --> 00:06:48,759
so you can meet drunk girls
who lift their shirts?

131
00:06:49,697 --> 00:06:50,797
Yes, please.

132
00:06:53,516 --> 00:06:55,168
Is that a no on the clothes money?

133
00:06:55,779 --> 00:06:57,310
I'll talk to your mother about it.

134
00:06:57,601 --> 00:06:59,351
Now I'm filled with hope.

135
00:07:01,029 --> 00:07:02,329
Alan, come here.

136
00:07:04,713 --> 00:07:06,340
Are you gonna make me feel worse?

137
00:07:06,465 --> 00:07:07,737
Is that even possible?

138
00:07:07,905 --> 00:07:09,262
I wouldn't think so,

139
00:07:09,387 --> 00:07:11,237
but you usually find a way.

140
00:07:12,811 --> 00:07:13,886
What do you want?

141
00:07:14,011 --> 00:07:17,413
I overheard you trying
to talk Huckleberry out of education.

142
00:07:18,209 --> 00:07:19,859
Not my proudest moment.

143
00:07:19,984 --> 00:07:22,710
But I'm desperate to find a way
to buy Lyndsey a birthday present.

144
00:07:23,311 --> 00:07:24,994
All right, here's what I'm gonna do.

145
00:07:25,119 --> 00:07:27,590
I'm gonna lend you enough
so you can buy her something nice.

146
00:07:28,110 --> 00:07:30,240
- How much?
- Are you kidding?

147
00:07:30,365 --> 00:07:33,067
- You're negotiating with me?
- Forget it.

148
00:07:33,192 --> 00:07:36,015
I appreciate the offer,
but I'm not gonna take your money.

149
00:07:36,321 --> 00:07:39,654
I'm sorry. I think
I might have just had a small stroke.

150
00:07:39,779 --> 00:07:41,604
You're not gonna take my money?

151
00:07:42,032 --> 00:07:43,450
You heard me right.

152
00:07:43,575 --> 00:07:46,258
I have to find a way
to buy Lyndsey a nice present on my own.

153
00:07:46,383 --> 00:07:49,403
- It's a matter of self-respect.
- Little late for that, isn't it?

154
00:07:49,572 --> 00:07:51,359
If it was for me,
I'd take your money.

155
00:07:51,484 --> 00:07:53,324
If it was for you,
I wouldn't offer it.

156
00:07:53,534 --> 00:07:55,104
But this is my girlfriend.

157
00:07:55,395 --> 00:07:57,745
If I can't do this one thing
for her,

158
00:07:57,870 --> 00:07:59,330
then maybe I don't deserve her.

159
00:08:00,096 --> 00:08:01,166
What's your plan?

160
00:08:01,436 --> 00:08:02,586
I'm not sure,

161
00:08:02,918 --> 00:08:05,118
but when Alan Harper sets his mind

162
00:08:05,629 --> 00:08:07,927
just stand back and watch it happen.

163
00:08:10,159 --> 00:08:11,909
Cue the theme from Rocky.

164
00:10:27,118 --> 00:10:28,188
Need some help?

165
00:10:29,911 --> 00:10:32,275
- A little late to ask, don't you think?
- Nope.

166
00:10:34,676 --> 00:10:36,326
Well, the good news is,

167
00:10:36,746 --> 00:10:37,746
I am done.

168
00:10:38,441 --> 00:10:40,020
I have accomplished my mission.

169
00:10:40,145 --> 00:10:43,318
After three weeks of 16-hour days
at the office and the mall,

170
00:10:43,443 --> 00:10:46,271
I have managed to earn enough money
to buy Lyndsey a beautiful

171
00:10:46,396 --> 00:10:47,646
birthday present.

172
00:10:47,771 --> 00:10:48,571
Voilà!

173
00:10:49,264 --> 00:10:51,014
A matching set of natural

174
00:10:51,504 --> 00:10:53,744
South Sea Island pearls.

175
00:10:55,288 --> 00:10:56,338
No kidding?

176
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:58,551
And you got these at the mall?

177
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,960
Well, in the mall parking lot.

178
00:11:01,398 --> 00:11:03,389
You bought pearls from a guy
in a parking lot?

179
00:11:03,599 --> 00:11:04,599
Not a guy.

180
00:11:05,024 --> 00:11:06,624
A Tahitian wholesaler.

181
00:11:07,269 --> 00:11:09,562
You have any idea what the mark-up
is on these things?

182
00:11:09,730 --> 00:11:11,814
By eliminating the middleman,
I saved a fortune.

183
00:11:12,362 --> 00:11:15,024
- You sure about that?
- Don't worry, they're real.

184
00:11:15,149 --> 00:11:17,487
I have a certificate
of authenticity.

185
00:11:20,626 --> 00:11:22,533
The word authentic
doesn't have a K in it.

186
00:11:23,778 --> 00:11:25,870
It's the man's second language,
Charlie.

187
00:11:28,374 --> 00:11:29,897
For future reference,

188
00:11:30,022 --> 00:11:33,448
the way you can tell if pearls are real
is you rub them on your teeth.

189
00:11:33,573 --> 00:11:36,158
If they're rough, they're real,
if they're smooth, they're fake.

190
00:11:36,283 --> 00:11:37,984
Fine, I will prove it to you.

191
00:11:38,279 --> 00:11:39,133
See?

192
00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:42,230
Rough.

193
00:11:43,708 --> 00:11:45,535
And oddly minty.

194
00:12:03,284 --> 00:12:04,169
Oh, darn.

195
00:12:11,583 --> 00:12:13,751
- Morning.
- Morning. Hey, nice pearls.

196
00:12:14,701 --> 00:12:15,879
Found in the garbage.

197
00:12:16,694 --> 00:12:18,756
Strange some of the things people
throw away.

198
00:12:18,982 --> 00:12:20,457
I also found what looked like

199
00:12:20,582 --> 00:12:23,344
a half-written suicide note
in your brother's handwriting.

200
00:12:23,677 --> 00:12:25,638
- No kidding?
- Should I be worried?

201
00:12:25,806 --> 00:12:27,992
You mean
that he won't go through with it?

202
00:12:29,304 --> 00:12:31,478
He'll be fine.
He's just having money problems.

203
00:12:31,688 --> 00:12:33,347
Okay. But fair warning...

204
00:12:33,472 --> 00:12:35,607
he offs himself,
I ain't cleaning it up.

205
00:12:37,109 --> 00:12:38,985
- Who's offing themselves?
- Nobody.

206
00:12:39,153 --> 00:12:40,386
Nobody important.

207
00:12:42,387 --> 00:12:44,491
I was wondering,
are you going anywhere today?

208
00:12:44,721 --> 00:12:47,160
Don't try to play me,
knucklehead, just ask.

209
00:12:47,375 --> 00:12:48,620
Can I borrow your car?

210
00:12:48,829 --> 00:12:50,965
- Come on.
- That's a very expensive car.

211
00:12:51,090 --> 00:12:53,213
There's no way I'm putting you
behind that wheel.

212
00:12:53,338 --> 00:12:54,834
See you later.
I go to shop.

213
00:12:55,106 --> 00:12:57,754
- Have fun.
- Are you taking Uncle Charlie's car?

214
00:12:58,039 --> 00:13:00,171
- Yeah. Why?
- Maybe I could drive you.

215
00:13:00,296 --> 00:13:02,425
Save you the hassle of parking
and everything.

216
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:05,075
Aren't you the sweetest thing.
Thanks.

217
00:13:05,290 --> 00:13:06,679
See you, handsome!

218
00:13:07,850 --> 00:13:09,350
Yeah, see you, handsome.

219
00:13:11,830 --> 00:13:12,830
Wonderful.

220
00:13:13,862 --> 00:13:16,204
I just got outsmarted
by Mr. Potato Head.

221
00:13:33,854 --> 00:13:35,166
I did a bad thing.

222
00:13:40,316 --> 00:13:42,882
- A very bad thing.
- Sorry to hear it.

223
00:13:44,679 --> 00:13:46,958
- I don't want to tell you about it.
- Good.

224
00:13:47,221 --> 00:13:48,137
I am ashamed.

225
00:13:48,305 --> 00:13:50,996
Okay, we both know
you're gonna tell me, so just tell me.

226
00:13:51,203 --> 00:13:53,540
In order to explain it,
I have to go back a few years.

227
00:13:53,665 --> 00:13:55,165
Please, God help me.

228
00:13:55,929 --> 00:13:58,731
Back when Judith and I were
still married but having problems,

229
00:13:58,941 --> 00:14:01,151
I decided to try to make her happy
by buying her

230
00:14:01,319 --> 00:14:03,528
a really nice
pair or diamond earrings.

231
00:14:03,921 --> 00:14:06,865
- You could afford diamond earrings?
- No alimony, no child support.

232
00:14:07,146 --> 00:14:08,649
It was a bountiful time.

233
00:14:10,578 --> 00:14:13,582
Anyway, I spent a fortune on them
and I wrapped them up really nice

234
00:14:13,707 --> 00:14:17,041
and took her to an expensive restaurant
and gave them to her over cocktails.

235
00:14:17,973 --> 00:14:19,923
- And?
- She said, "Thanks,"

236
00:14:20,081 --> 00:14:22,578
ordered the lobster,
then filed for divorce.

237
00:14:23,349 --> 00:14:25,351
At which point, I moved in with you.

238
00:14:26,205 --> 00:14:28,887
You're right, Alan,
that was a very bad thing.

239
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:32,360
- No, that was just the prologue.
- Please, God, help me.

240
00:14:32,987 --> 00:14:35,491
So, this afternoon,
I was over at Judith's to talk to her

241
00:14:35,616 --> 00:14:38,527
about using my child support payments
to buy Jake new clothes.

242
00:14:38,652 --> 00:14:40,273
- Yeah?
- She's against it.

243
00:14:41,734 --> 00:14:44,110
We argued,
she stormed out of the room

244
00:14:44,397 --> 00:14:46,791
and left me standing there by myself

245
00:14:47,154 --> 00:14:48,711
in the house I used to own.

246
00:14:49,437 --> 00:14:51,689
Anyway, before I left,
I figured I'd pee.

247
00:14:51,922 --> 00:14:54,705
I didn't really need to, but, you got
to figure with the traffic,

248
00:14:54,830 --> 00:14:57,040
- it's a good defensiv...
- Would you please get to it!

249
00:14:57,562 --> 00:14:59,382
Almost there, almost there. So,

250
00:14:59,794 --> 00:15:01,646
as I was walking down the hallway,

251
00:15:01,771 --> 00:15:04,621
I noticed that Judith's bedroom door
was open,

252
00:15:05,562 --> 00:15:09,177
and... I thought
about those beautiful diamond earrings

253
00:15:09,626 --> 00:15:12,043
just sitting there
in her jewelry box and...

254
00:15:12,264 --> 00:15:15,141
how I can't even afford to buy
my girlfriend a birthday present.

255
00:15:15,866 --> 00:15:18,645
Let me guess.
You peed in her jewelry box.

256
00:15:22,535 --> 00:15:24,609
Judith never even wore them,
Charlie.

257
00:15:25,426 --> 00:15:27,654
You stole diamonds
from your ex-wife?

258
00:15:28,875 --> 00:15:29,656
Yeah.

259
00:15:30,986 --> 00:15:31,885
Kudos!

260
00:15:36,701 --> 00:15:38,769
I don't even know how it happened.

261
00:15:38,894 --> 00:15:41,843
It was like I was in a dream,
and my hands belonged to someone else.

262
00:15:41,968 --> 00:15:43,824
I have that same dream all the time.

263
00:15:45,281 --> 00:15:47,761
Except in mine,
the hands do belong to someone else.

264
00:15:48,586 --> 00:15:51,511
I'm a good man, Charlie;
I play by the rules. This isn't me.

265
00:15:51,783 --> 00:15:52,877
Sure it is.

266
00:15:53,002 --> 00:15:56,024
You made up your mind that you get
Lyndsey a nice birthday present.

267
00:15:56,149 --> 00:15:58,960
The only part that isn't you
is that you succeeded.

268
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:02,105
I can't give these to Lyndsey...
they're tainted.

269
00:16:02,528 --> 00:16:04,816
I have to sneak them back
into Judith's jewelry box.

270
00:16:05,307 --> 00:16:07,068
- You can't do that.
- Why not?

271
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:08,580
Don't you watch TV?

272
00:16:08,811 --> 00:16:11,638
Every time the crooks try to put
the stolen loot back, it always goes

273
00:16:11,763 --> 00:16:13,366
horribly, and hilariously, wrong.

274
00:16:13,732 --> 00:16:15,758
I will just have
to take that chance.

275
00:16:15,883 --> 00:16:18,621
Tomorrow I am going back to Judith's.
I'm gonna make this right.

276
00:16:19,336 --> 00:16:20,536
Suit yourself.

277
00:16:23,277 --> 00:16:25,515
I don't suppose you want
to come with me?

278
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:28,172
Maybe distract her
while I put the earrings back?

279
00:16:28,568 --> 00:16:31,404
Yeah, that sounds like a great plan.
What could go wrong?

280
00:16:33,742 --> 00:16:36,472
- Okay, I'll do it myself.
- Don't call me for bail money.

281
00:16:36,731 --> 00:16:39,098
Why not? You were gonna give me
money to buy a present.

282
00:16:39,223 --> 00:16:41,436
You're not even planning
to get away with it?

283
00:16:41,561 --> 00:16:42,811
Of course I am.

284
00:16:43,486 --> 00:16:46,357
I was always planning
to become an astronaut and a cowboy.

285
00:16:54,264 --> 00:16:55,264
Hey, baby.

286
00:16:55,836 --> 00:16:57,994
- How was shopping?
- We had a great time.

287
00:16:58,162 --> 00:16:59,712
Yeah, it was a blast.

288
00:17:02,527 --> 00:17:04,908
Look... I got the same watch
Johnny Depp has.

289
00:17:05,999 --> 00:17:09,070
Wait, wait, wait, hold on.
You bought him all this?

290
00:17:09,195 --> 00:17:11,834
- He was so helpful.
- Here you go, handsome.

291
00:17:13,891 --> 00:17:15,902
By they way,
you got a parking ticket.

292
00:17:20,393 --> 00:17:23,519
Damn it, I don't want you buying stuff
for that clown on my credit card.

293
00:17:23,889 --> 00:17:25,438
Why not? You buy me stuff.

294
00:17:25,825 --> 00:17:27,599
- There's a difference.
- What's that?

295
00:17:27,941 --> 00:17:31,778
Well, you're having sex with me,
and he's... he's just screwing me.

296
00:17:41,044 --> 00:17:42,330
You okay, honey?

297
00:17:43,043 --> 00:17:44,707
Yeah. I'm just a little tired.

298
00:17:45,172 --> 00:17:47,694
Of course you are.
You've been working so hard.

299
00:17:48,911 --> 00:17:51,688
- I got a little something for you.
- Lyndsey, not tonight...

300
00:17:51,813 --> 00:17:53,716
I'm dead from the waist down.

301
00:17:53,855 --> 00:17:55,389
Silly! Not that.

302
00:17:56,212 --> 00:17:57,042
This.

303
00:17:57,635 --> 00:17:59,380
- What is it?
- Open it and see.

304
00:18:02,761 --> 00:18:05,228
"A day of pampering
at the Beverly Glen Spa"?

305
00:18:05,662 --> 00:18:08,940
You can get a massage, scalp treatment,
facial, mani-pedi, anything you want.

306
00:18:09,301 --> 00:18:12,110
- What's the occasion?
- You're my man... you deserve it.

307
00:18:16,991 --> 00:18:17,891
Oh, boy.

308
00:18:18,448 --> 00:18:19,826
What's the matter?

309
00:18:20,844 --> 00:18:22,245
Your birthday's on Saturday.

310
00:18:22,675 --> 00:18:26,582
Alan... I told you, I don't expect
anything fancy or expensive.

311
00:18:27,183 --> 00:18:28,450
I know you don't.

312
00:18:32,958 --> 00:18:34,632
Which is why I got you these!

313
00:18:38,571 --> 00:18:41,024
- You shouldn't have!
- Tell me about it.

314
00:18:41,734 --> 00:18:43,349
They must have cost a fortune!

315
00:18:44,076 --> 00:18:45,718
Not really. I stole 'em.

316
00:18:53,194 --> 00:18:54,444
To my birthday girl.

317
00:18:54,737 --> 00:18:56,863
Thank you, sweetie.
How do they look?

318
00:18:57,274 --> 00:18:59,866
Almost as beautiful
as the woman who's wearing them.

319
00:19:06,541 --> 00:19:08,875
What a surprise.
What brings you here?

320
00:19:09,231 --> 00:19:11,575
It's our...
weekly in-lieu-of-sex dinner.

321
00:19:16,078 --> 00:19:18,802
- Hi, Lyndsey. How have you been?
- Good, thanks.

322
00:19:18,927 --> 00:19:20,023
How about you?

323
00:19:21,096 --> 00:19:21,971
Fine.

324
00:19:23,533 --> 00:19:25,892
- Alan, what is wrong with you?
- Nothing. I'm just...

325
00:19:26,184 --> 00:19:29,578
here with my girlfriend having...
a little birthday celebration.

326
00:19:30,184 --> 00:19:32,116
- What are you doing?
- I'm sorry,

327
00:19:32,241 --> 00:19:34,692
I love it when your hair
is down... it's so sexy.

328
00:19:36,387 --> 00:19:37,787
He's right, it is.

329
00:19:39,181 --> 00:19:41,733
- Would you like to join us for a drink?
- Great idea!

330
00:19:43,644 --> 00:19:45,494
So, Lyndsey, happy birthday.

331
00:19:45,757 --> 00:19:48,110
- Thank you.
- Did you get anything special?

332
00:19:48,235 --> 00:19:49,707
Well, as a matter of fact...

333
00:19:49,875 --> 00:19:52,145
All right, I just have
to say something here!

334
00:19:52,878 --> 00:19:56,529
You whine and moan
about not having enough money to buy

335
00:19:56,783 --> 00:19:58,959
decent clothes for our son,
and yet...

336
00:19:59,084 --> 00:20:01,416
somehow there's enough for you
go out and have a...

337
00:20:01,541 --> 00:20:02,991
a big fancy dinner!

338
00:20:03,829 --> 00:20:04,655
What?

339
00:20:05,215 --> 00:20:06,933
Are you suddenly hard of hearing?

340
00:20:07,124 --> 00:20:09,727
Or are you just...
allergic to the truth?

341
00:20:10,358 --> 00:20:12,033
- Hey, hold on...
- No, no!

342
00:20:12,158 --> 00:20:15,066
This needs to be said!
You should be ashamed of yourself!

343
00:20:16,019 --> 00:20:17,962
Shame! Shame, shame...

344
00:20:21,046 --> 00:20:21,946
Shame.

345
00:20:23,839 --> 00:20:25,359
Come on, Herb.
He's crazy.

346
00:20:27,295 --> 00:20:29,580
Happy birthday, Lyndsey.
I love the earrings.

347
00:20:29,842 --> 00:20:30,804
Coming.

348
00:20:36,213 --> 00:20:38,256
Can you believe I was married
to that bitch?

349
00:20:48,819 --> 00:20:50,738
- Where have you been?
- I was...

350
00:20:50,890 --> 00:20:52,645
dropping Jake off at his mother's.

351
00:20:52,987 --> 00:20:55,565
- How are you handling your guilt?
- You mean about the earrings?

352
00:20:57,079 --> 00:20:58,779
Well, interesting thing.

353
00:20:59,798 --> 00:21:01,701
It's much easier the second time.

354
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:09,160
