1
00:00:01,635 --> 00:00:03,035
? Men. ?

2
00:00:03,821 --> 00:00:04,847
All righty.

3
00:00:05,047 --> 00:00:05,655
Here we go.

4
00:00:05,656 --> 00:00:08,324
$ 38.41 for school pictures.

5
00:00:08,325 --> 00:00:09,542
Thanks.

6
00:00:10,077 --> 00:00:11,544
You forgot to sign it.

7
00:00:11,545 --> 00:00:12,945
No. Did I?

8
00:00:12,946 --> 00:00:15,298
Oh! Silly me.

9
00:00:15,299 --> 00:00:19,269
Um. Alan... Jerome... Harper...

10
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:20,837
D.C.

11
00:00:20,838 --> 00:00:23,122
District of Columbia?

12
00:00:24,925 --> 00:00:27,477
Doctor of Chiropractic.

13
00:00:27,478 --> 00:00:30,063
You know, not everyone can use
those letters after his name.

14
00:00:30,064 --> 00:00:32,298
Congratulations.
Give me the check.

15
00:00:32,498 --> 00:00:34,898
— Sync, corrected by elderman —
— for www.addic7ed.com —

16
00:00:34,968 --> 00:00:36,402
You put the wrong date.

17
00:00:36,403 --> 00:00:38,137
Oh. Did I?

18
00:00:38,138 --> 00:00:39,606
Yeah, see? It's
for next month?

19
00:00:39,607 --> 00:00:41,140
Oh! Uh, don't worry about that,

20
00:00:41,141 --> 00:00:42,975
that's just for
bookkeeping purposes.

21
00:00:42,976 --> 00:00:45,245
This isn't going to be
like the check you gave me

22
00:00:45,246 --> 00:00:46,863
for the field trip
to Catalina, is it?

23
00:00:46,864 --> 00:00:49,032
Hey, hey, that was
the bank's mistake.

24
00:00:49,033 --> 00:00:51,150
Yeah? Well, the teacher
made me stay on the boat

25
00:00:51,151 --> 00:00:53,453
while everyone else went
swimming with dolphins.

26
00:00:53,454 --> 00:00:55,371
Dolphins carry disease, Jake.

27
00:00:56,257 --> 00:00:59,325
Alan Harper, D.I.C.

28
00:00:59,326 --> 00:01:00,993
You're welcome!

29
00:01:00,994 --> 00:01:02,128
You're cheap.

30
00:01:02,129 --> 00:01:03,663
I'm not cheap,
I'm broke!

31
00:01:03,664 --> 00:01:05,265
There's a difference.

32
00:01:05,266 --> 00:01:07,467
He was cheap long
before he was broke.

33
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:11,888
If you knew what I'd done
on that table recently,

34
00:01:11,889 --> 00:01:14,741
you wouldn't put
your face on it.

35
00:01:17,294 --> 00:01:18,528
I don't get it, Charlie.

36
00:01:18,529 --> 00:01:20,830
I'm a good guy, I try
to do the right thing,

37
00:01:20,831 --> 00:01:22,482
and I have nothing
to show for it.

38
00:01:22,483 --> 00:01:24,684
Are you still grinding
on the fact that you

39
00:01:24,685 --> 00:01:25,952
finally met a great gal,

40
00:01:25,953 --> 00:01:26,953
moved in with her,

41
00:01:26,954 --> 00:01:28,621
had a house you
could call your own,

42
00:01:28,622 --> 00:01:30,557
then burned it down along
with all your possessions

43
00:01:30,558 --> 00:01:33,510
and watched her run off
with her ex-husband?

44
00:01:33,511 --> 00:01:36,713
Was it really necessary
to list the entire fiasco?

45
00:01:36,714 --> 00:01:40,433
I enjoy the
occasional recap.

46
00:01:40,434 --> 00:01:41,668
But look at the bright side.

47
00:01:41,669 --> 00:01:42,702
What bright side?

48
00:01:42,703 --> 00:01:44,470
I just got a big residual check,

49
00:01:44,471 --> 00:01:45,555
and I'm heading to Vegas!

50
00:01:45,556 --> 00:01:46,723
Oh, my God!

51
00:01:46,724 --> 00:01:49,058
Do you have any idea
how long it would take me

52
00:01:49,059 --> 00:01:50,310
to earn that kind of money?

53
00:01:50,311 --> 00:01:51,728
Oh, don't think like that.

54
00:01:51,729 --> 00:01:53,879
You're never going
to earn that kind of money.

55
00:01:56,383 --> 00:01:57,317
Seriously— table.

56
00:01:57,318 --> 00:01:59,102
Oh...!

57
00:01:59,103 --> 00:02:02,222
Okay, I know I give
you a hard time,

58
00:02:02,223 --> 00:02:06,025
but it makes me feel horrible
watching you go through this.

59
00:02:06,026 --> 00:02:07,193
You know what
I'm going to do?

60
00:02:07,194 --> 00:02:08,444
What?

61
00:02:08,445 --> 00:02:10,163
Stop watching you.

62
00:02:11,865 --> 00:02:14,200
I'm starting to
feel better already.

63
00:02:16,253 --> 00:02:18,204
Table!

64
00:02:18,205 --> 00:02:20,640
? Men, men, men, men, manly men,
men, men?

65
00:02:20,641 --> 00:02:22,551
? Ah. ?
? Men. ?
? Men. ?

66
00:02:22,751 --> 00:02:26,051
? Two and a Half Men 8x05?
The Immortal Mr. Billy Joel
Original Air Date on October 18, 2010

67
00:02:26,125 --> 00:02:27,876
? Men. ?

68
00:02:28,481 --> 00:02:30,099
Okay, I'm out of here.

69
00:02:30,164 --> 00:02:32,582
Bye.

70
00:02:32,583 --> 00:02:34,350
Oh, Zippy.

71
00:02:34,351 --> 00:02:36,669
I can't stand seeing
you like this.

72
00:02:36,670 --> 00:02:39,255
You going to
Vegas, too?

73
00:02:39,256 --> 00:02:40,957
I wish.

74
00:02:42,877 --> 00:02:46,346
You know, I've been
where you are.

75
00:02:46,347 --> 00:02:48,515
What'd you do on the table?

76
00:02:53,754 --> 00:02:56,890
No... I've been
down and out.

77
00:02:56,891 --> 00:02:58,141
I've lost everything,

78
00:02:58,142 --> 00:03:00,126
didn't know where my next
meal was coming from.

79
00:03:00,127 --> 00:03:01,277
Really?

80
00:03:01,278 --> 00:03:03,363
Felt like I was all
alone in the world.

81
00:03:03,364 --> 00:03:04,531
No friends.

82
00:03:04,532 --> 00:03:07,217
Nobody who gave a damn
whether I lived or died.

83
00:03:07,218 --> 00:03:08,651
What'd you do?

84
00:03:08,652 --> 00:03:12,021
Well, first thing I did
was pick myself up,

85
00:03:12,022 --> 00:03:15,692
dust myself off, and rat out
my ex-boyfriend to the Feds.

86
00:03:15,693 --> 00:03:17,694
You're kidding.

87
00:03:17,695 --> 00:03:19,963
Got a $2,500 reward from

88
00:03:19,964 --> 00:03:22,248
the Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco, and Firearms.

89
00:03:23,801 --> 00:03:26,369
Took that, and invested
it in a pallet of

90
00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:27,887
counterfeit
Jordache jeans,

91
00:03:27,888 --> 00:03:30,640
set up a booth at the
Rose Bowl swap meet.

92
00:03:30,641 --> 00:03:31,925
Made a killing.

93
00:03:31,926 --> 00:03:32,959
Really?

94
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,644
Took those profits
and opened up

95
00:03:34,645 --> 00:03:36,863
a little donut shop,
across the street

96
00:03:36,864 --> 00:03:39,365
from a police station...

97
00:03:39,366 --> 00:03:40,934
Can't miss, right?

98
00:03:41,969 --> 00:03:45,137
Turns out, cops don't
like paying for donuts.

99
00:03:46,941 --> 00:03:50,527
Lost my ass.

100
00:03:50,528 --> 00:03:53,730
Had to go to work cleaning
toilets for strangers.

101
00:03:53,731 --> 00:03:56,132
What's the point
of this story?

102
00:03:56,133 --> 00:04:00,036
I just wanted you to know
I've had a colorful past.

103
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:05,008
Good night.

104
00:04:06,877 --> 00:04:08,828
It was a hell of a story.

105
00:04:08,829 --> 00:04:11,764
? Men. ?

106
00:04:11,765 --> 00:04:14,434
Jake, I'm going to take a nap.

107
00:05:16,564 --> 00:05:17,764
Ow.

108
00:05:31,178 --> 00:05:32,595
Oh...

109
00:05:32,596 --> 00:05:35,632
Egyptian cotton.

110
00:05:44,224 --> 00:05:47,110
Might as well take a nap
in style for a change.

111
00:05:55,936 --> 00:05:58,121
Oh, yeah.

112
00:06:01,325 --> 00:06:03,126
No wonder he can
have so much sex.

113
00:06:03,127 --> 00:06:06,212
The mattress does half the work.

114
00:06:06,213 --> 00:06:09,448
Oh, hello.

115
00:06:09,449 --> 00:06:12,218
New TV.

116
00:06:12,219 --> 00:06:13,836
Hmm, remote.

117
00:06:13,837 --> 00:06:17,073
Remote, where is
the remote?

118
00:06:21,895 --> 00:06:23,012
Poor Charlie.

119
00:06:23,013 --> 00:06:26,099
Went to Vegas
and forgot his hooker money.

120
00:06:29,853 --> 00:06:31,020
Oh, here we go.

121
00:06:43,901 --> 00:06:45,251
What the hell?

122
00:06:45,252 --> 00:06:48,604
You sick bastard.

123
00:06:48,605 --> 00:06:50,690
Oh...

124
00:06:50,691 --> 00:06:53,793
This would be terrific
with a woman.

125
00:07:05,856 --> 00:07:06,939
Ugh.

126
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:10,643
My ass cannot be that big.

127
00:07:10,644 --> 00:07:12,845
Ugh...

128
00:07:17,534 --> 00:07:19,318
Who's your daddy?

129
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:21,320
Who's your daddy?

130
00:07:21,321 --> 00:07:23,656
Unfortunately,
you are.

131
00:07:25,125 --> 00:07:26,192
Hey, buddy.

132
00:07:26,193 --> 00:07:27,643
Uh, what
are you doing up here?

133
00:07:27,644 --> 00:07:29,962
You're on the TV downstairs.

134
00:07:31,765 --> 00:07:34,751
Yes, well, there's a very
good explanation for that.

135
00:07:34,752 --> 00:07:35,802
I'm listening.

136
00:07:35,803 --> 00:07:37,036
It never happened.

137
00:07:37,971 --> 00:07:40,790
Understood. Daddy.

138
00:07:42,593 --> 00:07:44,594
? Men. ?

139
00:07:44,595 --> 00:07:47,096
Yeah, hi, this is Charlie Harper
in the garden suite.

140
00:07:47,097 --> 00:07:49,565
I'm going to need a couple
more pillows and some ice.

141
00:07:49,566 --> 00:07:50,767
Thank you.

142
00:07:54,238 --> 00:07:56,739
Okay, this is nice...

143
00:07:56,740 --> 00:07:58,941
quiet... private...

144
00:08:00,611 --> 00:08:01,994
Come on in.

145
00:08:03,781 --> 00:08:06,332
Mr. Harper?

146
00:08:06,333 --> 00:08:08,067
Call me Charlie.

147
00:08:08,068 --> 00:08:10,753
All right, Charlie.

148
00:08:10,754 --> 00:08:11,721
Call me Kendra.

149
00:08:11,722 --> 00:08:14,824
Can I call you Nurse Kendra?

150
00:08:14,825 --> 00:08:16,876
If you like.

151
00:08:16,877 --> 00:08:18,244
Ooh, I like.

152
00:08:19,930 --> 00:08:22,581
I gotta tell you, Nurse Kendra,
I'm a little nervous.

153
00:08:22,582 --> 00:08:24,100
I've never done anything
like this before.

154
00:08:24,101 --> 00:08:27,236
Oh! A newbie.
Well, don't worry.

155
00:08:27,237 --> 00:08:29,222
You're in good hands.

156
00:08:29,223 --> 00:08:30,473
Is it going to hurt?

157
00:08:30,474 --> 00:08:34,777
Maybe a little soreness
afterwards... some bruising...

158
00:08:34,778 --> 00:08:38,097
Well, I guess that's
what I'm paying for, right?

159
00:08:39,233 --> 00:08:40,817
Hello, Mr. Harper!

160
00:08:40,818 --> 00:08:42,318
Welcome to the
Schenkman Clinic.

161
00:08:42,319 --> 00:08:46,122
We have you down for an eye lift
and a neck tuck in the morning.

162
00:08:46,123 --> 00:08:47,206
That's correct.

163
00:08:47,207 --> 00:08:49,108
Is there anything else
you'd like done

164
00:08:49,109 --> 00:08:50,159
while you're out?

165
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,577
Little lipo? Nose job?

166
00:08:51,578 --> 00:08:52,611
Penis enlargement?

167
00:08:52,612 --> 00:08:54,080
No, no. No, thanks.

168
00:08:54,081 --> 00:08:55,498
And for the record,

169
00:08:55,499 --> 00:08:57,583
I got a penis enlargement
when you walked in the room.

170
00:08:57,584 --> 00:08:59,952
Thank you.

171
00:09:01,221 --> 00:09:03,589
You have any questions?
Concerns?

172
00:09:03,590 --> 00:09:06,242
I don't think so, I just want
to make sure I look natural,

173
00:09:06,243 --> 00:09:07,593
like I haven't
had any work done.

174
00:09:07,594 --> 00:09:08,761
No. Don't you worry.

175
00:09:08,762 --> 00:09:10,462
My work is undetectable.

176
00:09:10,463 --> 00:09:12,798
In fact, you might be surprised
to learn that Kendra here

177
00:09:12,799 --> 00:09:15,234
is a 62-year-old black man.

178
00:09:17,988 --> 00:09:19,155
I'm kidding.

179
00:09:19,156 --> 00:09:22,641
But those boobs?
Those are Schenkman's.

180
00:09:22,642 --> 00:09:25,311
I'm not sure I want my eyes
to pop out like that.

181
00:09:25,312 --> 00:09:27,646
You're going to look great.
See you in the morning.

182
00:09:27,647 --> 00:09:29,982
Thank you, Doc.

183
00:09:29,983 --> 00:09:31,450
Anything else you need?

184
00:09:31,451 --> 00:09:33,119
I think I'm okay.

185
00:09:33,987 --> 00:09:34,987
Wait, wait, wait.

186
00:09:34,988 --> 00:09:36,289
There is one thing.

187
00:09:36,290 --> 00:09:39,292
No, you can't see them.

188
00:09:39,293 --> 00:09:40,659
Then I'm good.

189
00:09:43,197 --> 00:09:44,981
? Men. ?

190
00:09:46,099 --> 00:09:49,001
Jake! Your mom's here!

191
00:09:54,892 --> 00:09:56,275
Hey.

192
00:09:56,276 --> 00:09:59,478
Well, I guess it
was probably inevitable.

193
00:09:59,479 --> 00:10:00,780
What? Oh!

194
00:10:00,781 --> 00:10:02,031
Oh, the clothes.

195
00:10:02,032 --> 00:10:04,850
Well, as you know, most
of mine burned up in the fire,

196
00:10:04,851 --> 00:10:07,486
and Charlie's in Vegas,
so I figured, why not?

197
00:10:07,487 --> 00:10:09,488
Because you look like an idiot.

198
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,207
Hey, Mom.

199
00:10:11,208 --> 00:10:12,241
Hi.
Bye, buddy.

200
00:10:12,242 --> 00:10:15,077
Get help.

201
00:10:17,414 --> 00:10:19,081
Wish I could afford it!

202
00:10:22,102 --> 00:10:23,252
Oh, man.

203
00:10:23,253 --> 00:10:27,590
My life is pathetic.

204
00:10:27,591 --> 00:10:29,809
On the other hand...

205
00:10:31,311 --> 00:10:33,479
Charlie's life is great.

206
00:10:34,982 --> 00:10:36,098
Bartender!

207
00:10:36,099 --> 00:10:37,817
Drinks for everybody!

208
00:10:39,686 --> 00:10:42,188
Just house brands.

209
00:10:42,189 --> 00:10:44,223
Hi. Charlie Harper.

210
00:10:44,224 --> 00:10:46,709
? Men. ?

211
00:10:48,151 --> 00:10:49,868
? Men. ?

212
00:10:49,869 --> 00:10:52,220
Wow! A house
on the beach.

213
00:10:52,221 --> 00:10:53,521
That's awesome,
Charlie.

214
00:10:53,522 --> 00:10:55,991
Well, I suppose it
must seem that way.

215
00:10:55,992 --> 00:10:57,959
I mean, you'd think
driving around town

216
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,127
in a big,
brand-new Mercedes

217
00:10:59,128 --> 00:11:01,163
would also be pretty awesome.

218
00:11:01,164 --> 00:11:02,130
And— and it is.

219
00:11:02,131 --> 00:11:04,666
Um, but, at the end
of the day,

220
00:11:04,667 --> 00:11:07,002
doesn't matter
how much stuff you have.

221
00:11:07,003 --> 00:11:09,171
What matters is
what's in here.

222
00:11:09,172 --> 00:11:11,890
Oh, what is in here?

223
00:11:11,891 --> 00:11:13,975
Oh! Pfft! More cash.

224
00:11:15,044 --> 00:11:16,645
How about that?

225
00:11:16,646 --> 00:11:19,681
And you got all that
just by writing jingles?

226
00:11:19,682 --> 00:11:21,883
I know! Not even a real job.

227
00:11:21,884 --> 00:11:24,686
What can I say? You know,
some of us are very lucky.

228
00:11:24,687 --> 00:11:29,257
Very, very...
very lucky.

229
00:11:29,258 --> 00:11:31,259
Charlie?

230
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:34,196
Yeah.
Charlie.

231
00:11:34,197 --> 00:11:37,616
I mean, yeah!
Charlie!

232
00:11:37,617 --> 00:11:39,400
You want to get
out of here?

233
00:11:39,401 --> 00:11:41,069
Wow! Where'd
that come from?

234
00:11:41,070 --> 00:11:42,287
I thought we
were getting along.

235
00:11:42,288 --> 00:11:44,256
N-No!

236
00:11:44,257 --> 00:11:45,590
I mean together.

237
00:11:45,591 --> 00:11:47,042
Someplace quiet?

238
00:11:47,743 --> 00:11:49,594
Oh, yes, uh, yes,
by all means!

239
00:11:49,595 --> 00:11:50,846
Let's go somewhere quiet.

240
00:11:50,847 --> 00:11:53,765
Uh, bartender, thank you for
taking such good care of us.

241
00:11:53,766 --> 00:11:54,800
Here you go.

242
00:11:54,801 --> 00:11:57,385
One, two, three dollars.

243
00:11:57,386 --> 00:11:58,920
Give one of those
to the waitress.

244
00:11:58,921 --> 00:12:00,722
So, where would
you like to go?

245
00:12:00,723 --> 00:12:03,024
How about your beach house?

246
00:12:04,227 --> 00:12:05,861
Great idea!

247
00:12:05,862 --> 00:12:07,279
Yeah, why go to
Denny's or Appleby's

248
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:08,763
when you have
your own beach house?

249
00:12:08,764 --> 00:12:12,484
Come, let us Mercedes
to the beach.

250
00:12:12,485 --> 00:12:14,986
This is so easy.

251
00:12:16,155 --> 00:12:17,772
? Men. ?

252
00:12:17,773 --> 00:12:19,958
Charlie...

253
00:12:20,776 --> 00:12:23,328
Mom?

254
00:12:25,381 --> 00:12:27,265
Sweet Jesus!

255
00:12:27,266 --> 00:12:28,550
Surprise!

256
00:12:28,551 --> 00:12:30,252
What happened to you?

257
00:12:30,253 --> 00:12:31,670
What are you doing here?

258
00:12:31,671 --> 00:12:34,956
Since I referred you to Dr.
Schenkman, he was kind enough

259
00:12:34,957 --> 00:12:36,591
to offer me a
free chemical peel.

260
00:12:36,592 --> 00:12:39,961
When this heals, I will have
the face of a 12-year-old girl.

261
00:12:39,962 --> 00:12:41,963
Yeah, but from
the neck down,

262
00:12:41,964 --> 00:12:43,965
you'll still be
an Egyptian mummy.

263
00:12:43,966 --> 00:12:45,817
Oh, hush.

264
00:12:45,818 --> 00:12:48,019
I just stopped by
to wish you luck tomorrow.

265
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:49,020
Well, thanks.

266
00:12:49,021 --> 00:12:51,189
No, wait— why would
I need luck?

267
00:12:51,190 --> 00:12:53,325
Oh, no reason.

268
00:12:54,193 --> 00:12:56,611
That 60 Minutes report
on Dr. Schenkman

269
00:12:56,612 --> 00:12:58,813
was entirely one-sided.

270
00:13:00,199 --> 00:13:03,418
Much like that
poor woman's vagina.

271
00:13:06,172 --> 00:13:07,372
Sleep well.

272
00:13:26,125 --> 00:13:30,228
Yeah, like I'm going
to sleep at all after that.

273
00:13:30,229 --> 00:13:32,113
? Men. ?

274
00:13:32,114 --> 00:13:35,567
Welcome to the Casa del Charlie.

275
00:13:35,568 --> 00:13:37,285
Wow.

276
00:13:37,286 --> 00:13:38,820
What a beautiful beach house.

277
00:13:38,821 --> 00:13:39,905
Yes, yes, it is.

278
00:13:39,906 --> 00:13:41,022
Beach is out there.

279
00:13:41,023 --> 00:13:43,491
And just past it,
the ocean.

280
00:13:43,492 --> 00:13:45,026
Oh.

281
00:13:45,027 --> 00:13:46,628
Keep going
and you hit Hawaii.

282
00:13:46,629 --> 00:13:47,695
Oh.

283
00:13:47,696 --> 00:13:49,364
Then Japan.

284
00:13:49,365 --> 00:13:53,084
And I guess this is where
you write all your jingles.

285
00:13:53,085 --> 00:13:55,303
Yup. This is
where the magic happens.

286
00:13:56,606 --> 00:13:58,139
Play me something.

287
00:13:59,559 --> 00:14:00,926
Oh, gosh.

288
00:14:02,228 --> 00:14:04,012
I'd rather not.

289
00:14:04,013 --> 00:14:06,381
Oh, please? For me.

290
00:14:07,183 --> 00:14:08,183
Well, if you insist.

291
00:14:22,014 --> 00:14:23,698
Ah...

292
00:14:23,699 --> 00:14:31,506
Here is a little song
you might remember by...

293
00:14:34,243 --> 00:14:36,428
the immortal...

294
00:14:39,298 --> 00:14:41,132
Mr. Billy Joel.

295
00:14:46,188 --> 00:14:48,256
? Harry Truman, Doris Day?

296
00:14:48,257 --> 00:14:50,392
? Red China, Johnnie Ray?

297
00:14:50,393 --> 00:14:54,262
? South Pacific,
Walter Winchell, Joe DiMaggio?

298
00:14:54,263 --> 00:14:55,447
? Ho!

299
00:14:55,448 --> 00:14:57,198
? Joe McCarthy, Richard Nixon?

300
00:14:57,199 --> 00:14:59,434
? Studebaker, television?

301
00:15:01,871 --> 00:15:04,039
? Marilyn Monroe?

302
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:07,042
? We didn't start the fire?

303
00:15:07,043 --> 00:15:11,212
? It was always burning since
the world's been turning?

304
00:15:11,213 --> 00:15:13,614
? We didn't start the fire?

305
00:15:13,615 --> 00:15:17,802
? No, we didn't light it,
but we tried to fight it?

306
00:15:17,803 --> 00:15:20,055
? We didn't start the fire!

307
00:15:28,547 --> 00:15:30,098
You're very talented.

308
00:15:30,099 --> 00:15:31,132
Oh, no, no, no.

309
00:15:31,133 --> 00:15:33,018
Billy Joel is very talented.

310
00:15:33,019 --> 00:15:34,986
I'm just a piano man.

311
00:15:34,987 --> 00:15:37,605
I only have one question.
What's that?

312
00:15:37,606 --> 00:15:40,575
How long are you going
to pretend to be Charlie Harper?

313
00:15:43,663 --> 00:15:45,530
? Sing us a song?

314
00:15:45,531 --> 00:15:47,532
? You're the piano man... ?

315
00:15:47,533 --> 00:15:49,734
Oh, please... yeah,
give it a rest.

316
00:15:51,003 --> 00:15:52,487
How'd you know?

317
00:15:52,488 --> 00:15:54,255
I've been with Charlie.

318
00:15:54,256 --> 00:15:56,791
I-I've been in
this house.

319
00:15:56,792 --> 00:15:58,209
Well...

320
00:15:58,210 --> 00:16:00,378
Color me embarrassed.

321
00:16:01,547 --> 00:16:03,831
So...

322
00:16:03,832 --> 00:16:05,500
Who are you?

323
00:16:06,719 --> 00:16:08,269
All right. All right.

324
00:16:08,270 --> 00:16:10,605
Here's the truth.

325
00:16:10,606 --> 00:16:13,441
My real name is Derek.

326
00:16:15,444 --> 00:16:17,846
Brick.

327
00:16:18,981 --> 00:16:21,182
House.

328
00:16:22,485 --> 00:16:25,019
Derek Brickhouse.

329
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:26,454
Yeah, try again.

330
00:16:26,455 --> 00:16:28,540
All right.

331
00:16:28,541 --> 00:16:30,909
My name is Alan.
I'm-I'm Charlie's brother.

332
00:16:30,910 --> 00:16:32,494
I-I live on his
fold-out couch.

333
00:16:32,495 --> 00:16:33,962
I'm-I'm sorry.
I'll drive you back.

334
00:16:33,963 --> 00:16:35,163
Hang on.

335
00:16:35,164 --> 00:16:36,798
I didn't say I
wanted to go.

336
00:16:36,799 --> 00:16:39,700
Oh, no, but I thought
it was kind of implied.

337
00:16:39,701 --> 00:16:42,637
I'm having a good
time, aren't you?

338
00:16:42,638 --> 00:16:45,757
Well, not now.

339
00:16:45,758 --> 00:16:48,009
I was.

340
00:16:48,010 --> 00:16:50,211
When I was Charlie.

341
00:16:50,212 --> 00:16:52,731
And Billy Joel.

342
00:16:52,732 --> 00:16:54,983
Who else do
you like to be?

343
00:16:54,984 --> 00:16:56,017
What do you mean?

344
00:16:56,018 --> 00:17:01,039
I think role-playing
is kind of a turn-on.

345
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,490
No kidding.

346
00:17:02,491 --> 00:17:03,608
Yeah.

347
00:17:03,609 --> 00:17:05,360
That's why I came
back here with you.

348
00:17:05,361 --> 00:17:07,412
Makes some guys nervous.

349
00:17:07,413 --> 00:17:08,496
Your brother hated it.

350
00:17:08,497 --> 00:17:09,730
Well, I am not my brother.

351
00:17:11,083 --> 00:17:13,668
As you so adroitly
pointed out.

352
00:17:13,669 --> 00:17:15,703
Come on.

353
00:17:15,704 --> 00:17:17,122
Oh, boy.

354
00:17:17,123 --> 00:17:19,007
Role playing.

355
00:17:19,008 --> 00:17:20,925
Can I be the man?

356
00:17:20,926 --> 00:17:22,577
Are you serious?

357
00:17:22,578 --> 00:17:26,765
Well, I've had
a bad run lately.

358
00:17:26,766 --> 00:17:28,333
? Men. ?

359
00:17:28,334 --> 00:17:30,552
Mr. Harper.

360
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:33,754
Mr. Harper.

361
00:17:33,755 --> 00:17:35,190
How are you feeling?

362
00:17:35,191 --> 00:17:37,225
Okay.

363
00:17:37,226 --> 00:17:38,409
How'd it go?

364
00:17:38,410 --> 00:17:40,361
It went great.

365
00:17:40,362 --> 00:17:43,031
And the doctor decided
to give you a bonus.

366
00:17:43,032 --> 00:17:45,266
Check 'em out.

367
00:17:49,405 --> 00:17:51,122
Oh, no, no.

368
00:17:51,123 --> 00:17:52,323
I didn't ask for these.

369
00:17:52,324 --> 00:17:53,608
But you haven't
even seen them yet.

370
00:17:53,609 --> 00:17:57,378
I don't want to see them.

371
00:17:57,379 --> 00:17:59,531
Hang on.

372
00:18:03,952 --> 00:18:08,256
You know, this could work.

373
00:18:15,815 --> 00:18:17,632
? Men. ?

374
00:18:17,633 --> 00:18:20,735
So, Gretchen, what exactly
was the role playing

375
00:18:20,736 --> 00:18:22,337
that freaked Charlie out
so much?

376
00:18:22,338 --> 00:18:24,072
Hang on. You'll see.

377
00:18:24,073 --> 00:18:26,107
I'm just glad you're not
as uptight as he is.

378
00:18:26,108 --> 00:18:29,110
Well, as you know, I'm
capable of bending the rules

379
00:18:29,111 --> 00:18:31,279
and going with the flow.

380
00:18:45,327 --> 00:18:48,062
What do you think,

381
00:18:48,063 --> 00:18:50,298
Schweinhund?

382
00:18:55,054 --> 00:18:58,506
Not a deal-breaker.

383
00:18:58,507 --> 00:19:00,942
? Men. ?

384
00:19:03,804 --> 00:19:05,387
? Men. ?

385
00:19:05,388 --> 00:19:07,089
Honey, I'm home.

386
00:19:07,090 --> 00:19:10,392
In the kitchen.

387
00:19:10,393 --> 00:19:12,595
Kids okay?

388
00:19:14,681 --> 00:19:16,649
How's the Beaver?

389
00:19:16,650 --> 00:19:18,984
Everybody's fine.
How's Vegas?

390
00:19:18,985 --> 00:19:21,070
You know, the usual.

391
00:19:21,071 --> 00:19:22,071
How was your weekend?

392
00:19:22,072 --> 00:19:23,322
Pretty good.

393
00:19:23,323 --> 00:19:25,524
I met a girl.

394
00:19:31,615 --> 00:19:33,916
Did her name happen
to be Gretchen?

395
00:19:33,917 --> 00:19:35,785
Jawohl.

396
00:19:39,089 --> 00:19:40,756
That's indelible marker,
you know.
I know.

397
00:19:40,757 --> 00:19:42,908
Don't worry, it'll
come off in a few weeks.

398
00:19:42,909 --> 00:19:44,076
That's what I figured.

399
00:19:44,077 --> 00:19:46,045
Does she still have
her little mustache?

400
00:19:46,046 --> 00:19:48,247
You know, down
at the Russian front?

401
00:19:48,248 --> 00:19:51,350
I wouldn't know
what she's got.

402
00:19:51,351 --> 00:19:53,552
I was blindfolded
and hog-tied.

403
00:19:53,553 --> 00:19:55,805
Right, right, right.

404
00:19:55,806 --> 00:19:57,422
Why are you wearing
sunglasses?

405
00:19:57,423 --> 00:19:58,524
No reason.

406
00:19:58,525 --> 00:19:59,558
Why don't you take them off?

407
00:19:59,559 --> 00:20:01,777
Okay, fine.

408
00:20:01,778 --> 00:20:03,946
You might as well know.

409
00:20:06,266 --> 00:20:08,234
Bar fight.

410
00:20:08,235 --> 00:20:10,569
Oh, no. What happened?

411
00:20:10,570 --> 00:20:13,072
Eh, some bikers were giving
a stripper a hard time,

412
00:20:13,073 --> 00:20:14,456
so I jumped in.

413
00:20:14,457 --> 00:20:15,440
You're kidding.

414
00:20:15,441 --> 00:20:16,826
You know me.

415
00:20:16,827 --> 00:20:19,245
I can't stand to see
a naked, high-heeled,

416
00:20:19,246 --> 00:20:21,213
glitter-covered,
ping-pong-ball-shooting

417
00:20:21,214 --> 00:20:23,749
woman in distress.

418
00:20:25,218 --> 00:20:28,804
Wow.
That-That sounds very brave.

419
00:20:28,805 --> 00:20:30,172
Good for you.

420
00:20:30,173 --> 00:20:31,724
Thank you.

421
00:20:31,725 --> 00:20:33,292
Uh, Charlie?

422
00:20:33,293 --> 00:20:34,459
Yeah?

423
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:36,061
Uh, if you're going
to go with that story,

424
00:20:36,062 --> 00:20:37,229
you might want to ask mom

425
00:20:37,230 --> 00:20:38,764
to stop telling people
you had your eyes done.

426
00:20:38,765 --> 00:20:41,217
Damn.

427
00:20:42,352 --> 00:20:44,803
The mummy strikes again.

428
00:20:47,274 --> 00:20:51,143
You know, it's actually
not a bad look.

429
00:20:51,144 --> 00:20:53,329
Shame one guy had
to ruin it for everybody.

430
00:20:53,330 --> 00:20:54,797
? Men. ?

431
00:20:54,798 --> 00:20:58,683
