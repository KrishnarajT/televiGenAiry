1
00:00:08,943 --> 00:00:10,927
Sorry.

2
00:00:13,231 --> 00:00:15,248
It's okay, alan.

3
00:00:15,249 --> 00:00:18,051
I don't have to have an orgasm
every time we make love.

4
00:00:18,052 --> 00:00:19,686
I did my best.

5
00:00:19,687 --> 00:00:21,521
It's just that my sinuses
are a little blocked

6
00:00:21,522 --> 00:00:23,106
And I needed my mouth
for breathing.

7
00:00:23,107 --> 00:00:25,525
Don't worry about it.
You were great.

8
00:00:25,526 --> 00:00:26,710
"a" for effort.

9
00:00:26,711 --> 00:00:28,328
Yeah, but on my report card

10
00:00:28,329 --> 00:00:30,614
It's still going to
say "incomplete."

11
00:00:30,615 --> 00:00:31,731
Don't dwell on that.

12
00:00:31,732 --> 00:00:34,084
Let's just enjoy
being together.

13
00:00:34,085 --> 00:00:35,285
I am enjoying it.

14
00:00:35,295 --> 00:00:36,673
Whoa. Thirsty.

15
00:00:37,102 --> 00:00:39,136
I need to tell you something.

16
00:00:39,137 --> 00:00:40,438
Uh-huh.

17
00:00:40,439 --> 00:00:42,940
I think I love you,
Alan Harper.

18
00:00:45,694 --> 00:00:47,895
Did it go down
the wrong way?

19
00:00:47,896 --> 00:00:51,015
Yeah, that seems to be
the theme of the evening.

20
00:00:54,536 --> 00:00:56,570
Are you going
to leave me hanging?

21
00:00:56,571 --> 00:01:00,241
You said it was okay.
You told me to stop.

22
00:01:00,242 --> 00:01:01,709
You know what I mean.

23
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:03,577
I just told you
I love you.

24
00:01:03,578 --> 00:01:05,046
Oh, oh, that.

25
00:01:05,047 --> 00:01:07,581
Oh, well, you know,
it goes without saying

26
00:01:07,582 --> 00:01:09,800
that I feel the same way.

27
00:01:09,801 --> 00:01:11,368
Then say it.

28
00:01:11,369 --> 00:01:13,220
Okay.

29
00:01:13,221 --> 00:01:15,139
I love you, Lyndsey.

30
00:01:16,008 --> 00:01:18,059
Why?

31
00:01:20,228 --> 00:01:21,395
Why?

32
00:01:21,396 --> 00:01:23,197
What do you love about me?

33
00:01:23,198 --> 00:01:25,716
Oh, well, what's
not to love?

34
00:01:25,717 --> 00:01:30,104
You know, you're-you're
beautiful and-and-and

35
00:01:30,105 --> 00:01:33,791
strong and smart and sexy.

36
00:01:33,792 --> 00:01:35,993
Uh-huh.

37
00:01:37,062 --> 00:01:38,946
Uh, confident,

38
00:01:38,947 --> 00:01:42,733
um, loyal, thrifty.

39
00:01:44,169 --> 00:01:46,170
Clean.

40
00:01:46,171 --> 00:01:47,905
Yeah?

41
00:01:47,906 --> 00:01:50,240
Persistent.

42
00:01:50,241 --> 00:01:52,626
Well, why do you love me?

43
00:01:52,627 --> 00:01:55,179
I don't know, I just do.

44
00:01:56,048 --> 00:01:57,431
That's not fair.

45
00:01:57,432 --> 00:01:59,016
Why did I get the
essay question?

46
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:02,920
I think you should move in.

47
00:02:06,692 --> 00:02:08,392
You want me to move in here?

48
00:02:08,393 --> 00:02:09,477
Why not?

49
00:02:09,478 --> 00:02:10,644
We love each other.

50
00:02:10,645 --> 00:02:12,930
Plus, our sons get along.

51
00:02:12,931 --> 00:02:14,648
They can walk
to school from here,

52
00:02:14,649 --> 00:02:16,300
Jake's mom lives
just down the street,

53
00:02:16,301 --> 00:02:18,369
and there's plenty of room
for him on weekends.

54
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:20,955
Sounds like you've been
giving this a lot of thought.

55
00:02:20,956 --> 00:02:22,106
I have.

56
00:02:22,107 --> 00:02:24,108
Is that why I got
an incomplete,

57
00:02:24,109 --> 00:02:25,376
'cause you were distracted?

58
00:02:25,377 --> 00:02:26,877
No.

59
00:02:27,713 --> 00:02:29,163
Oh.

60
00:02:29,164 --> 00:02:31,665
Can you think of any reasons
why we shouldn't live together?

61
00:02:31,666 --> 00:02:34,752
Uh, no,
not off the top of my head.

62
00:02:34,753 --> 00:02:37,171
Which you were staring at
for quite a while.

63
00:02:42,344 --> 00:02:44,512
Look, I don't want
to back you into a corner.

64
00:02:44,513 --> 00:02:45,896
Why don't you
think about it.

65
00:02:45,897 --> 00:02:48,632
Yeah, yeah, why don't I sit
with it for a day or two.

66
00:02:48,633 --> 00:02:50,651
And you can think about
why you love me.

67
00:02:50,652 --> 00:02:52,903
Okay.

68
00:02:53,772 --> 00:02:54,822
Mm.

69
00:02:54,823 --> 00:02:58,409
Oh, I guess I should
be getting home soon.

70
00:02:58,410 --> 00:03:00,811
If you lived here,
you'd be home already.

71
00:03:00,812 --> 00:03:02,246
That's true.

72
00:03:02,247 --> 00:03:04,815
That's funny— I always see
those signs on the freeway,

73
00:03:04,816 --> 00:03:06,817
"If you lived here,
you'd be home already"

74
00:03:06,818 --> 00:03:08,836
And, you know, I
can't help but think,

75
00:03:08,837 --> 00:03:11,338
if I lived there, I'd have
a big sign outside my window

76
00:03:11,339 --> 00:03:14,324
ruining my perfectly
good view of the freeway.

77
00:03:14,325 --> 00:03:16,377
And if you lived
next to the freeway,

78
00:03:16,378 --> 00:03:18,763
you wouldn't be
getting this.

79
00:03:19,598 --> 00:03:21,599
Mmm, mmm, hang on.

80
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,467
Let's just wet
the ol' whistle.

81
00:03:23,468 --> 00:03:26,771
My mouth.
I'm talking about mouth.

82
00:03:26,772 --> 00:03:29,723
? Men, men, men, men, manly men,
men, men?

83
00:03:29,724 --> 00:03:32,726
? Ah. ?
? Men. ?
? Men. ?

84
00:03:33,264 --> 00:03:36,365
? Two and a Half Men 8x02?
A Bottle of Wine and a Jackhammer
Original Air Date on September 27, 2010

85
00:03:36,915 --> 00:03:38,132
Yeah, hi.

86
00:03:38,178 --> 00:03:41,313
I'm watching your commercial,
Cash for Gold,

87
00:03:41,314 --> 00:03:43,048
and you just showed a woman

88
00:03:43,049 --> 00:03:45,835
selling her wedding ring
for $500.

89
00:03:45,836 --> 00:03:47,686
No, I don't want to sell gold.

90
00:03:47,687 --> 00:03:49,454
I want to meet that woman.

91
00:03:49,455 --> 00:03:50,973
She's hot

92
00:03:50,974 --> 00:03:53,392
and we know her marriage
isn't working out.

93
00:03:53,393 --> 00:03:54,626
Hey.

94
00:03:54,627 --> 00:03:56,345
Call you back.

95
00:03:59,316 --> 00:04:01,233
You got any gold in your teeth?

96
00:04:01,234 --> 00:04:03,569
A little. Why?

97
00:04:03,570 --> 00:04:05,654
Just thinking.

98
00:04:08,041 --> 00:04:09,959
Lyndsey told me
she loves me tonight.

99
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:11,026
Really? What'd you say?

100
00:04:11,027 --> 00:04:15,197
What could I say?
"I love you, too."

101
00:04:15,198 --> 00:04:16,615
Do you love her?

102
00:04:16,616 --> 00:04:17,883
Yeah, sure.

103
00:04:17,884 --> 00:04:19,651
What's not to love?

104
00:04:19,652 --> 00:04:20,836
Oh, I don't know.

105
00:04:20,837 --> 00:04:25,257
Her mood swings,
her idiot teenage son

106
00:04:25,258 --> 00:04:26,792
and the fact that you need
a muscle relaxer,

107
00:04:26,793 --> 00:04:29,662
a bottle of wine and
a jackhammer to get her off.

108
00:04:31,831 --> 00:04:35,500
Hey, I told you about that
in confidence.

109
00:04:36,336 --> 00:04:38,354
Who else is here?

110
00:04:39,672 --> 00:04:42,391
The same two people know.

111
00:04:42,392 --> 00:04:45,945
All right, well,
let's keep it that way.

112
00:04:45,946 --> 00:04:49,148
She also said she wants me
to move in with her.

113
00:04:49,149 --> 00:04:52,735
Is that forever
or just till you get her off?

114
00:04:52,736 --> 00:04:55,154
Charlie...

115
00:04:55,155 --> 00:04:56,521
You're right, you're right,
you're right,

116
00:04:56,522 --> 00:04:58,240
that's a distinction
without a difference.

117
00:04:58,241 --> 00:04:59,992
Are you listening to me?

118
00:04:59,993 --> 00:05:01,877
Lyndsey said she wants me
to move out of here

119
00:05:01,878 --> 00:05:03,362
and in with her.

120
00:05:03,363 --> 00:05:05,965
Oh, you were serious.

121
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:08,634
Well, that's great.
Congratulations.

122
00:05:08,635 --> 00:05:10,169
When are you leaving?

123
00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:12,271
I don't know.

124
00:05:12,272 --> 00:05:14,089
I told her I'd think about it.

125
00:05:14,090 --> 00:05:15,424
What's to think about?

126
00:05:15,425 --> 00:05:17,343
She's a terrific gal and
she can make you happy.

127
00:05:17,344 --> 00:05:18,894
But you just said...

128
00:05:18,895 --> 00:05:21,230
Oh, please, that was
just me crackin' wise.

129
00:05:22,715 --> 00:05:25,217
Everybody's got
a little baggage.

130
00:05:25,218 --> 00:05:28,571
I drink and try to
mouth kiss hookers.

131
00:05:30,056 --> 00:05:33,525
You, you're cheap, annoying
and no one likes you.

132
00:05:33,526 --> 00:05:35,227
Lyndsey likes me.

133
00:05:35,228 --> 00:05:37,613
Which is why you should
move in with her.

134
00:05:37,614 --> 00:05:40,165
But this is my home,
I'm comfortable here.

135
00:05:40,166 --> 00:05:42,567
No, no, no, no,
this is my home...

136
00:05:43,903 --> 00:05:47,289
and before you moved into
it, I was comfortable here.

137
00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:50,742
Now, now, you always say that,
but you don't mean it.

138
00:05:50,743 --> 00:05:52,411
Yes, I do.

139
00:05:52,412 --> 00:05:54,630
Why won't you ever believe me?

140
00:05:54,631 --> 00:05:56,682
Come on,
after all these years,

141
00:05:56,683 --> 00:05:58,601
you're saying you wouldn't
miss me if I was gone?

142
00:05:58,602 --> 00:06:02,271
I'm saying I'd very much
like the chance to find out.

143
00:06:02,272 --> 00:06:05,224
Please, Alan,
give me that chance.

144
00:06:05,225 --> 00:06:06,942
No, I don't think so.

145
00:06:06,943 --> 00:06:08,861
My relationship with Lyndsey
is fine the way it is.

146
00:06:08,862 --> 00:06:11,397
I can come and go as I please,
I have my own space...

147
00:06:11,398 --> 00:06:13,932
No, no, no, no, no,
you have my space.

148
00:06:13,933 --> 00:06:17,403
Also a distinction
without a difference.

149
00:06:17,404 --> 00:06:19,771
So that's it?
You're not leaving?

150
00:06:19,772 --> 00:06:22,107
Like I said,
I'm comfortable here.

151
00:06:22,108 --> 00:06:24,543
Comfortable, huh?

152
00:06:24,544 --> 00:06:27,830
Okay, my path is clear.

153
00:06:30,634 --> 00:06:32,084
Oh.

154
00:06:32,085 --> 00:06:35,287
I can grow tomatoes
upside down.

155
00:06:37,057 --> 00:06:38,841
? Men. ?

156
00:06:45,398 --> 00:06:47,966
Hey, you awake?

157
00:06:47,967 --> 00:06:50,986
No, I can keep going.

158
00:06:50,987 --> 00:06:52,354
Alan. Alan.

159
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:54,690
Oh, hi.

160
00:06:54,691 --> 00:06:56,141
What's up?

161
00:06:56,142 --> 00:06:57,109
I need a favor.

162
00:06:57,110 --> 00:06:58,911
Okay, sure. What is it?

163
00:06:58,912 --> 00:06:59,978
I got this girl upstairs

164
00:06:59,979 --> 00:07:02,131
and I need you
to take care of her bird.

165
00:07:02,132 --> 00:07:04,917
Okay, when you say "bird,"

166
00:07:04,918 --> 00:07:07,002
what exactly is it
you're referring to?

167
00:07:07,003 --> 00:07:09,455
Get your mind
out of the gutter.

168
00:07:10,757 --> 00:07:12,324
Her bird.

169
00:07:13,493 --> 00:07:14,710
Here.

170
00:07:14,711 --> 00:07:16,595
Guess what his name is.

171
00:07:16,596 --> 00:07:18,997
Mothra?

172
00:07:18,998 --> 00:07:20,349
Larry.

173
00:07:20,350 --> 00:07:21,884
Larry Bird?

174
00:07:23,603 --> 00:07:24,687
Get it?

175
00:07:24,688 --> 00:07:26,171
Chick's from Boston.

176
00:07:26,172 --> 00:07:27,672
Anyway, I'd put him
in the living room,

177
00:07:27,673 --> 00:07:29,274
but Larry didn't like
to be alone.

178
00:07:29,275 --> 00:07:32,394
Oh. Okay, I guess.

179
00:07:32,395 --> 00:07:33,612
Thanks.

180
00:07:33,613 --> 00:07:35,981
Oh, yeah, don't put your hands
near his face.

181
00:07:35,982 --> 00:07:37,282
And if you get up to pee,

182
00:07:37,283 --> 00:07:38,901
make sure you close
the bathroom door.

183
00:07:38,902 --> 00:07:40,285
Why?

184
00:07:40,286 --> 00:07:42,237
I don't know, he's got
this thing about penises.

185
00:07:42,238 --> 00:07:43,789
He thinks they're big worms.

186
00:07:45,325 --> 00:07:47,693
Or L.A. Lakers.
Good night.

187
00:07:50,296 --> 00:07:52,965
Good night.

188
00:08:03,226 --> 00:08:05,377
Spank me!

189
00:08:06,212 --> 00:08:08,130
What?

190
00:08:08,131 --> 00:08:11,316
I'm a bad girl, spank me!

191
00:08:11,317 --> 00:08:14,403
Oh, for God's sake.

192
00:08:14,404 --> 00:08:16,572
Too big, too big.

193
00:08:16,573 --> 00:08:19,408
All right, all right, Larry,
go to sleep.

194
00:08:19,409 --> 00:08:21,527
That's it, baby. Oh, yeah.

195
00:08:21,528 --> 00:08:23,412
You're the best.

196
00:08:39,446 --> 00:08:41,764
Not a worm! Not a worm!

197
00:08:41,765 --> 00:08:44,550
? Men. ?

198
00:08:45,751 --> 00:08:47,186
And let me tell ya,

199
00:08:47,187 --> 00:08:49,438
it wasn't easy finding
a hooker with a big bird.

200
00:08:50,390 --> 00:08:52,558
Snakes, no problem.
They all got snakes.

201
00:08:52,559 --> 00:08:54,977
Shh, shh, shh,
here he comes.

202
00:09:01,868 --> 00:09:04,036
Thanks again
for watching Larry.

203
00:09:05,955 --> 00:09:09,491
I'd say bite me,
but that's been taken care of.

204
00:09:12,128 --> 00:09:14,779
Hey, I'm sorry if that
made you uncomfortable,

205
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:17,883
but from time to time, I do
entertain women in this house.

206
00:09:17,884 --> 00:09:21,804
That thing tried to
re-circumcise me.

207
00:09:21,805 --> 00:09:25,457
Maybe that's why
they call it a cockatoo.

208
00:09:27,927 --> 00:09:30,062
I know what you're doing,
and it's not gonna work.

209
00:09:30,063 --> 00:09:33,131
What ever are you talking about?

210
00:09:33,132 --> 00:09:34,817
I tell you I'm not moving in
with Lyndsey

211
00:09:34,818 --> 00:09:37,486
'cause I'm comfortable here,
and three hours later

212
00:09:37,487 --> 00:09:40,739
you put a giant penis-eating
parrot in my room.

213
00:09:41,658 --> 00:09:44,142
And you think
there's a connection?

214
00:09:44,143 --> 00:09:47,079
Yes, I think
there's a connection.

215
00:09:50,867 --> 00:09:52,501
Damn it.

216
00:09:52,502 --> 00:09:54,336
How do you get a guy
to leave your house

217
00:09:54,337 --> 00:09:55,671
who doesn't want to go?

218
00:09:55,672 --> 00:09:58,540
Tell him you missed your period
and you're out of pot.

219
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:02,827
Always worked for me.

220
00:10:03,763 --> 00:10:06,331
? Men. ?

221
00:10:08,434 --> 00:10:12,354
Hey, Alan, how are you
with the jumble?

222
00:10:12,355 --> 00:10:14,389
Charlie?

223
00:10:14,390 --> 00:10:15,724
What are you doing in here?

224
00:10:15,725 --> 00:10:19,478
Right now, the jumble.

225
00:10:19,479 --> 00:10:21,763
O-L-C-U-D?

226
00:10:21,764 --> 00:10:23,899
Cloud!

227
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:26,034
Cloud. Thank you.

228
00:10:26,035 --> 00:10:28,203
What are you doing
in my bathroom?

229
00:10:28,204 --> 00:10:31,189
Not much yet,
but I have high hopes.

230
00:10:32,041 --> 00:10:34,710
Come on, Charlie,
this is ridiculous.

231
00:10:34,711 --> 00:10:36,194
Oh, I'm sorry.

232
00:10:36,195 --> 00:10:38,413
Am I making you
uncomfortable?

233
00:10:38,414 --> 00:10:40,549
Not enough to make me move in
with Lyndsey.

234
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:42,167
Okay.

235
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:53,095
How about now?

236
00:10:55,214 --> 00:10:57,266
? Men. ?

237
00:10:57,267 --> 00:10:58,767
All right, bottom line,
what would it take

238
00:10:58,768 --> 00:11:00,552
to make you want to
move in with Lyndsey?

239
00:11:00,553 --> 00:11:03,272
For the last time, there is
no conceivable circumstance

240
00:11:03,273 --> 00:11:04,856
where I would entertain
leaving Malibu

241
00:11:04,857 --> 00:11:06,191
and moving in with Lyndsey.

242
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:09,161
Next time you drop the
soap in the shower,

243
00:11:09,162 --> 00:11:11,997
I'm gonna forget
you're my brother.

244
00:11:11,998 --> 00:11:14,750
Jake, your father's here!

245
00:11:14,751 --> 00:11:16,034
Hello, Alan.

246
00:11:16,035 --> 00:11:17,586
Charlie. How's it going?

247
00:11:17,587 --> 00:11:18,587
Great.

248
00:11:18,588 --> 00:11:20,122
Did you hear
Lyndsey MacElroy

249
00:11:20,123 --> 00:11:21,623
invited Alan to
move in with her?

250
00:11:21,624 --> 00:11:22,674
What?

251
00:11:22,675 --> 00:11:23,742
She lives right down the street.

252
00:11:23,743 --> 00:11:25,377
I know. You and Alan
would be neighbors.

253
00:11:25,378 --> 00:11:26,478
Cool, huh?
Now, hang on.

254
00:11:26,479 --> 00:11:28,130
I didn't say I was gonna do it.

255
00:11:28,131 --> 00:11:29,781
You bet your ass
you're not gonna do it.

256
00:11:29,782 --> 00:11:32,267
I will not have my ex-husband
living down the street from me.

257
00:11:32,268 --> 00:11:34,853
So you're saying it would
make you uncomfortable?

258
00:11:34,854 --> 00:11:35,887
Uncomfortable?

259
00:11:35,888 --> 00:11:37,289
It would drive me crazy.

260
00:11:37,290 --> 00:11:40,692
Jake, damn it,
get a move on!

261
00:11:40,693 --> 00:11:42,394
I'm moving in with Lyndsey.

262
00:11:50,008 --> 00:11:51,158
How's the pizza?

263
00:11:51,159 --> 00:11:52,259
Awesome.
Great.

264
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:54,094
It's a new takeout place.

265
00:11:54,095 --> 00:11:55,429
A little more expensive,

266
00:11:55,430 --> 00:11:56,930
but it's worth it.

267
00:11:56,931 --> 00:11:59,433
And for dessert, we have
red velvet cupcakes.

268
00:11:59,434 --> 00:12:00,834
Oh, man, those are my favorite.

269
00:12:00,835 --> 00:12:02,886
Hang on, Eldridge.

270
00:12:03,855 --> 00:12:06,557
Something's wrong here.

271
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:10,728
Are you sending us
to military school?

272
00:12:10,729 --> 00:12:12,396
No.

273
00:12:12,397 --> 00:12:13,997
Of course not.
Why would you think that?

274
00:12:13,998 --> 00:12:15,115
I don't know.

275
00:12:15,116 --> 00:12:16,900
16 years of bargain
pizza with fake cheese

276
00:12:16,901 --> 00:12:19,286
and Sam's Club vanilla
wafers for dessert?

277
00:12:21,355 --> 00:12:23,290
I don't want to go
to military school.

278
00:12:23,291 --> 00:12:25,292
No one's going
to military school.

279
00:12:25,293 --> 00:12:28,579
But there is, uh, something
we wanted to talk to you about.

280
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:30,748
Here it comes.

281
00:12:30,749 --> 00:12:32,249
Relax, it's good news.

282
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:33,467
Alan.

283
00:12:33,468 --> 00:12:35,769
All right, uh, as you both know,

284
00:12:35,770 --> 00:12:38,538
uh, Lyndsey and I have been
dating now for six months.

285
00:12:38,539 --> 00:12:41,091
Oh, man, did he
knock you up?

286
00:12:41,092 --> 00:12:42,643
No.

287
00:12:42,644 --> 00:12:44,377
Just be quiet and listen.

288
00:12:44,378 --> 00:12:46,546
Anyway, uh, we've both grown

289
00:12:46,547 --> 00:12:48,549
very fond of each other
during that time.

290
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:50,651
You are using
protection, right?

291
00:12:50,652 --> 00:12:52,770
That's none of your business,

292
00:12:52,771 --> 00:12:54,988
but I'm glad you're paying
attention in health class.

293
00:12:54,989 --> 00:12:57,224
Uh, but what
I'm trying to say

294
00:12:57,225 --> 00:12:59,493
is that Lyndsey and I

295
00:12:59,494 --> 00:13:00,644
have decided

296
00:13:00,645 --> 00:13:01,862
to live together.

297
00:13:03,748 --> 00:13:05,482
I don't think Uncle Charlie's
gonna like that.

298
00:13:05,483 --> 00:13:08,168
He's never been real pleased
that you and I moved in.

299
00:13:09,037 --> 00:13:10,637
Uh, no, no, no.

300
00:13:10,638 --> 00:13:12,940
We're going to live at
Lyndsey's and Eldridge's house.

301
00:13:12,941 --> 00:13:14,241
But I stay here, right?

302
00:13:14,242 --> 00:13:15,959
No. When you're not
at your mom's,

303
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:17,094
you'll be with us.

304
00:13:17,095 --> 00:13:19,596
So, I'm losing
my weekend beach house?

305
00:13:19,597 --> 00:13:22,633
Yeah, but you're gaining
a whole family.

306
00:13:22,634 --> 00:13:24,751
I'd rather have
a weekend beach house.

307
00:13:24,752 --> 00:13:27,387
Do I have to share
my bathroom with him?

308
00:13:27,388 --> 00:13:28,555
Eldridge.

309
00:13:28,556 --> 00:13:29,807
What's wrong with sharing
a bathroom with me?

310
00:13:29,808 --> 00:13:30,974
I like my privacy.

311
00:13:30,975 --> 00:13:32,392
Yeah, we all know
what that's about.

312
00:13:32,393 --> 00:13:33,177
Jake!

313
00:13:33,178 --> 00:13:34,978
You're Mr. Whack-a-Mole, not me.

314
00:13:34,979 --> 00:13:36,864
Yeah, well, at least
I don't watch gay porn.

315
00:13:36,865 --> 00:13:39,233
That was a total accident!

316
00:13:39,234 --> 00:13:41,034
I don't want to
live with him.

317
00:13:41,035 --> 00:13:42,469
Well, you don't have to worry
about it, 'cause I'm not going.

318
00:13:42,470 --> 00:13:44,188
Guys, guys, come on.
No!

319
00:13:44,189 --> 00:13:45,539
Forget it. I mean,
it's bad enough

320
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:46,840
you're sleeping
with this loser.

321
00:13:46,841 --> 00:13:47,724
Eldridge!

322
00:13:47,725 --> 00:13:48,926
Are you calling my dad a loser?

323
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:50,711
You call him a loser
all the time.

324
00:13:50,712 --> 00:13:52,212
He's my dad, I'm allowed.

325
00:13:52,213 --> 00:13:54,698
Uh, well, Jake, technically
you're not allowed.

326
00:13:54,699 --> 00:13:56,783
Is it okay for me to call
your mom what you call her?

327
00:13:56,784 --> 00:13:57,918
What do you call me?
Okay,

328
00:13:57,919 --> 00:13:59,169
we've gotten
off track here.

329
00:14:00,171 --> 00:14:01,722
Uh, who's ready for cupcakes?

330
00:14:01,723 --> 00:14:03,507
Screw you and your cupcakes.

331
00:14:03,508 --> 00:14:04,725
Yeah.

332
00:14:09,463 --> 00:14:11,698
I'll just, uh,
take one for later.

333
00:14:13,801 --> 00:14:16,520
? Happy days are here again?

334
00:14:16,521 --> 00:14:19,573
? The skies above
are clear again?

335
00:14:19,574 --> 00:14:22,860
? I'm getting rid
of the queer again?

336
00:14:22,861 --> 00:14:25,412
? Happy days are here again?

337
00:14:25,413 --> 00:14:26,196
Hey.

338
00:14:26,197 --> 00:14:27,998
Hey there. Ho there.

339
00:14:27,999 --> 00:14:29,082
What are you doing?

340
00:14:29,083 --> 00:14:30,000
Just thought I'd help you

341
00:14:30,001 --> 00:14:31,251
get a jump on
the packing.

342
00:14:31,252 --> 00:14:32,419
Oh, oh.

343
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:34,538
Well, you can unpack,
'cause I'm not leaving.

344
00:14:34,539 --> 00:14:35,706
What?

345
00:14:35,707 --> 00:14:37,007
No.

346
00:14:37,008 --> 00:14:39,009
The boys just won't
go along with it.

347
00:14:39,010 --> 00:14:40,928
You're giving those two morons
a vote?

348
00:14:40,929 --> 00:14:42,512
It's too traumatic.

349
00:14:42,513 --> 00:14:44,181
You know, turning their lives
upside down.

350
00:14:44,182 --> 00:14:46,266
So? Let them be traumatized.

351
00:14:46,267 --> 00:14:49,219
That's the trouble with kids
these days, not enough trauma.

352
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:50,604
Charlie, I'm sorry.

353
00:14:50,605 --> 00:14:52,773
I know you were looking forward
to having the house

354
00:14:52,774 --> 00:14:54,725
back to yourself,
but it's just not gonna happen.

355
00:14:54,726 --> 00:14:56,843
Oh, it's gonna happen.

356
00:14:56,844 --> 00:15:00,280
As God is my witness, and by all
that's holy, it's gonna happen.

357
00:15:00,281 --> 00:15:02,182
Amen.

358
00:15:02,183 --> 00:15:04,184
Keep packing.

359
00:15:12,527 --> 00:15:15,045
He couldn't spell
"miscellaneous"?

360
00:15:15,046 --> 00:15:16,380
It's my life and my house.

361
00:15:16,381 --> 00:15:17,464
I don't need your permission.

362
00:15:17,465 --> 00:15:18,582
I don't care!

363
00:15:18,583 --> 00:15:20,050
I'll just go live
with Dad and Stephanie!

364
00:15:20,051 --> 00:15:21,218
Oh, won't that be nice.

365
00:15:21,219 --> 00:15:23,337
You'll be reunited
with your old babysitter.

366
00:15:23,338 --> 00:15:25,038
Excuse us. Walk.

367
00:15:25,039 --> 00:15:26,706
Dude.
Don't "dude" me.

368
00:15:26,707 --> 00:15:28,926
I'm in no mood
for "dude."
Ow, ow, ow, ow.

369
00:15:28,927 --> 00:15:31,878
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.

370
00:15:34,732 --> 00:15:36,433
Dude.

371
00:15:36,434 --> 00:15:38,385
Don't "dude" him, dude.

372
00:15:39,270 --> 00:15:40,404
All right, what's this I hear

373
00:15:40,405 --> 00:15:41,888
about you guys not wanting
to live together?

374
00:15:41,889 --> 00:15:44,241
I want my privacy and...
I like it here.
I mean, come on...

375
00:15:44,242 --> 00:15:45,242
It was a rhetorical question!

376
00:15:45,243 --> 00:15:46,910
I don't give a rat's ass!

377
00:15:48,029 --> 00:15:51,999
Now, the happiness of
your parents is at stake here.

378
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,418
So we're gonna reason
this out like adults,

379
00:15:54,419 --> 00:15:56,086
in the interest of all involved.

380
00:15:57,622 --> 00:16:00,590
Here's $500.

381
00:16:00,591 --> 00:16:02,459
Split it up any way you want.

382
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:03,710
Nice.
Whoa.

383
00:16:03,711 --> 00:16:04,845
And that's just a down payment.

384
00:16:04,846 --> 00:16:06,213
There's extra hundred in it
for every month

385
00:16:06,214 --> 00:16:07,648
you keep my brother
out of my house.

386
00:16:07,649 --> 00:16:09,433
$100 a month?

387
00:16:09,434 --> 00:16:12,602
That's, like, $1,000 a year.

388
00:16:12,603 --> 00:16:14,354
Almost.

389
00:16:16,190 --> 00:16:17,607
Do we have a deal?

390
00:16:17,608 --> 00:16:18,942
Deal.
Deal.

391
00:16:18,943 --> 00:16:20,227
Great.

392
00:16:20,228 --> 00:16:24,114
I should write a book
on parenting.

393
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:27,784
How are we supposed
to split this?

394
00:16:27,785 --> 00:16:29,336
I don't know, dude.

395
00:16:29,337 --> 00:16:32,956
No matter how I figure it,
there's gonna be one left over.

396
00:16:32,957 --> 00:16:35,075
? Men. ?

397
00:16:38,179 --> 00:16:41,298
? Hit the road, Jack,
and don't you come back?

398
00:16:41,299 --> 00:16:44,668
? No more, no more,
no more, no more?

399
00:16:44,669 --> 00:16:48,338
? Hit the road, Jack, and don't
you come back no more. ?

400
00:16:48,339 --> 00:16:49,890
Okay, we're leaving.

401
00:16:49,891 --> 00:16:51,641
What you say?

402
00:16:51,642 --> 00:16:54,478
I said we're all packed
and we're leaving.

403
00:16:54,479 --> 00:16:56,146
I know, I know.
I heard you.

404
00:16:56,147 --> 00:16:58,348
I just never get
tired of hearing it.

405
00:16:59,183 --> 00:17:01,768
Jake, say good-bye
to your uncle.

406
00:17:01,769 --> 00:17:02,769
Bye.

407
00:17:02,770 --> 00:17:05,138
Bye.

408
00:17:05,139 --> 00:17:07,074
That's it?
After all these years?

409
00:17:07,075 --> 00:17:09,576
Um, I had a good time here.

410
00:17:09,577 --> 00:17:10,577
Who wouldn't?

411
00:17:10,578 --> 00:17:11,995
It's a beach house in Malibu.

412
00:17:11,996 --> 00:17:13,980
That's what I told him.

413
00:17:15,116 --> 00:17:18,001
So I guess I'll see you
at your high school graduation.

414
00:17:18,002 --> 00:17:20,454
Good one.

415
00:17:20,455 --> 00:17:21,955
I'll meet you
at Lyndsey's.

416
00:17:21,956 --> 00:17:23,206
Drive safe.

417
00:17:25,176 --> 00:17:26,543
Well, here we are.

418
00:17:27,762 --> 00:17:29,379
Final good-bye.

419
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:32,382
One can only hope.

420
00:17:32,383 --> 00:17:34,551
Come here.

421
00:17:39,974 --> 00:17:41,007
You've been a good brother.

422
00:17:41,008 --> 00:17:42,509
You were here
when I needed you,

423
00:17:42,510 --> 00:17:44,111
and I will be forever
in your debt.

424
00:17:44,112 --> 00:17:47,447
So, it's official,
you're never paying me back.

425
00:17:49,450 --> 00:17:52,285
Boy, we had some great times

426
00:17:52,286 --> 00:17:53,820
in this old place.

427
00:17:53,821 --> 00:17:56,356
You're walking
the wrong way, Alan.

428
00:17:57,858 --> 00:17:59,876
Remember when you set us up
with those two

429
00:17:59,877 --> 00:18:02,746
hot soap opera actresses,
and then we both got the flu?

430
00:18:03,748 --> 00:18:05,082
Soap opera actresses...

431
00:18:07,001 --> 00:18:08,635
Nope. Doesn't ring a bell.

432
00:18:08,636 --> 00:18:09,869
Drive carefully.

433
00:18:09,870 --> 00:18:11,054
Oh, come on.

434
00:18:11,055 --> 00:18:13,306
Um, how about when you found me
handcuffed to my bed

435
00:18:13,307 --> 00:18:15,875
wearing a bustier
and fishnet stockings?

436
00:18:18,679 --> 00:18:20,680
Sorry. Blanking on that, too.

437
00:18:20,681 --> 00:18:22,566
Well, yeah, but-but you got
to remember when we did the...

438
00:18:22,567 --> 00:18:24,184
Alan, Alan, Alan,
let me save you some trouble.

439
00:18:24,185 --> 00:18:26,386
My past is divided between
things I can't remember

440
00:18:26,387 --> 00:18:28,071
and things I don't want
to remember.

441
00:18:28,072 --> 00:18:29,889
And you're both.

442
00:18:31,725 --> 00:18:32,742
Right.

443
00:18:32,743 --> 00:18:34,911
Then, uh, wish me luck.

444
00:18:34,912 --> 00:18:37,280
You don't need luck.

445
00:18:37,281 --> 00:18:39,082
You guys were meant
for each other.

446
00:18:39,083 --> 00:18:42,252
In fact, let me start you off
on the right foot.

447
00:18:42,253 --> 00:18:43,286
Here's a
hundred bucks.

448
00:18:43,287 --> 00:18:44,588
Stop by the liquor
store on the way

449
00:18:44,589 --> 00:18:45,755
to your new home,
pick up a bottle

450
00:18:45,756 --> 00:18:46,840
of champagne to celebrate
with Lyndsey.

451
00:18:46,841 --> 00:18:48,792
A hundred bucks?

452
00:18:48,793 --> 00:18:51,578
For that kind of cash,
I could get a very decent bottle

453
00:18:51,579 --> 00:18:53,797
of Chardonnay and still have
some walking around money.

454
00:18:53,798 --> 00:18:55,582
Get the champagne, Alan.

455
00:18:55,583 --> 00:18:57,884
Right. It's your money.

456
00:18:57,885 --> 00:18:58,852
Exactly.

457
00:18:58,853 --> 00:19:00,753
We end as we began.

458
00:19:00,754 --> 00:19:04,474
All right, so, uh,
I guess I'll call you.

459
00:19:04,475 --> 00:19:05,475
Yeah.

460
00:19:05,476 --> 00:19:06,776
Make sure you leave a message.

461
00:19:07,895 --> 00:19:09,362
See, that's what
I'm gonna miss.

462
00:19:09,363 --> 00:19:12,199
Th-the banter,
the good-natured ribbing, the...

463
00:19:19,624 --> 00:19:22,826
I admit I had my doubts, Lord.

464
00:19:22,827 --> 00:19:26,779
But you have delivered me
unto the promised land.

465
00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:29,616
You're right,
I should change the locks.

466
00:19:31,452 --> 00:19:33,637
That's why you're the Lord.

467
00:19:35,473 --> 00:19:37,974
? Men. ?

468
00:19:37,975 --> 00:19:41,595
Boy, I didn't even realize
they made wine in Oklahoma.

469
00:19:41,596 --> 00:19:43,313
That'll be $8.49.

470
00:19:43,314 --> 00:19:44,648
Mm. Here you are.

471
00:19:44,649 --> 00:19:46,533
That's a hundred-dollar bill.

472
00:19:46,534 --> 00:19:49,486
You owe me $91.51.

473
00:19:52,573 --> 00:19:53,607
Alan?

474
00:19:53,608 --> 00:19:55,375
Melissa?

475
00:19:55,376 --> 00:19:56,910
What a coincidence.

476
00:19:56,911 --> 00:19:58,361
Yeah! How have you been?

477
00:19:58,362 --> 00:19:59,479
Okay. You?

478
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:00,914
Fine.

479
00:20:00,915 --> 00:20:01,698
How's Jake?

480
00:20:01,699 --> 00:20:03,366
Oh, uh, he's good.

481
00:20:03,367 --> 00:20:04,084
Charlie?

482
00:20:04,085 --> 00:20:05,702
Ah, same old.

483
00:20:05,703 --> 00:20:07,537
You look great.

484
00:20:07,538 --> 00:20:08,822
You, too. Gorgeous.

485
00:20:08,823 --> 00:20:09,822
Aw, thanks.

486
00:20:11,125 --> 00:20:12,259
I've missed you.

487
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:13,927
I've missed you, too.

488
00:20:13,928 --> 00:20:15,345
So, seeing anybody?

489
00:20:15,346 --> 00:20:17,180
Nope. You?

490
00:20:18,015 --> 00:20:19,933
No.

491
00:20:26,307 --> 00:20:28,258
? Men. ?

492
00:20:29,248 --> 00:20:30,668
? Men. ?

493
00:20:31,235 --> 00:20:32,768
Must be real important

494
00:20:32,769 --> 00:20:35,855
for you to call me out in the
middle of the night like this.

495
00:20:35,856 --> 00:20:37,740
You're doing God's work.

496
00:20:39,309 --> 00:20:40,809
Excuse me, pardon me.

497
00:20:40,810 --> 00:20:42,144
Alan?
I'll explain later.

498
00:20:42,145 --> 00:20:43,145
Hey, Charlie.

499
00:20:43,146 --> 00:20:44,664
Hey.

500
00:20:44,665 --> 00:20:47,667
Don't worry, I'm still
moving in with Lyndsey.

501
00:20:47,668 --> 00:20:49,702
This will just be
my pied-à-terre.

502
00:20:51,872 --> 00:20:55,208
Uh, that's French
for "love shack."

503
00:20:59,179 --> 00:21:03,182
Okay, that's it.
Let me speak to your supervisor.

504
