1
00:00:03,429 --> 00:00:05,577
I hope you don't mind,
I used your toothbrush.

2
00:00:05,702 --> 00:00:07,265
No problem.
Where'd you use it?

3
00:00:08,718 --> 00:00:10,226
Nowhere your mouth hasn't been.

4
00:00:14,441 --> 00:00:15,857
You are so beautiful.

5
00:00:16,437 --> 00:00:17,437
Thank you.

6
00:00:17,699 --> 00:00:18,834
Your hair.

7
00:00:18,959 --> 00:00:20,945
Your eyes.
They're just amazing.

8
00:00:22,198 --> 00:00:24,305
And this body, it's just perfect.

9
00:00:24,926 --> 00:00:25,926
Thank you.

10
00:00:26,786 --> 00:00:27,536
So...

11
00:00:28,161 --> 00:00:30,622
Why don't I want to have sex
with you anymore?

12
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:32,665
You don't?

13
00:00:32,844 --> 00:00:33,792
I'm sorry.

14
00:00:34,417 --> 00:00:36,586
It's okay. I don't want to, either.

15
00:00:37,587 --> 00:00:39,589
Thank God. I was feeling so guilty.

16
00:00:39,757 --> 00:00:40,657
Me, too!

17
00:00:41,008 --> 00:00:42,091
When did you know?

18
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:44,099
About two weeks ago.

19
00:00:44,224 --> 00:00:46,479
Alan took Jake to the movies,
we did it on the deck.

20
00:00:47,418 --> 00:00:49,553
All I thought about was picking up
the champagne bottle

21
00:00:49,678 --> 00:00:51,100
and caving in your skull.

22
00:00:51,945 --> 00:00:53,144
Were you angry with me?

23
00:00:54,127 --> 00:00:56,105
It was more just a way to kill time.

24
00:00:56,669 --> 00:00:59,533
You know,
fantasizing if I could get away with it.

25
00:00:59,658 --> 00:01:00,574
Interesting.

26
00:01:00,699 --> 00:01:03,471
I fantasized about you having
a heart attack or getting hit by a bus.

27
00:01:04,083 --> 00:01:06,491
I wouldn't be a suspect,
and people would feel sorry for me.

28
00:01:07,349 --> 00:01:08,149
Smart.

29
00:01:09,065 --> 00:01:10,245
So, when did you know?

30
00:01:10,656 --> 00:01:12,323
It was in the limo, wasn't it?

31
00:01:13,875 --> 00:01:15,594
Your attention was wandering.

32
00:01:15,719 --> 00:01:18,253
Every time I looked up,
you were somewhere else.

33
00:01:19,173 --> 00:01:21,779
I hate to say it, but I was making
believe you were another woman.

34
00:01:21,904 --> 00:01:23,424
That doesn't mean it's over.

35
00:01:23,828 --> 00:01:26,427
I pretended you were the big
blue chick from Avatar.

36
00:01:29,718 --> 00:01:30,682
It's over.

37
00:01:32,293 --> 00:01:34,310
So, what do we do now?

38
00:01:35,185 --> 00:01:36,437
Part friends, I guess.

39
00:01:36,763 --> 00:01:37,814
I'd like that.

40
00:01:38,521 --> 00:01:40,024
You're welcome to spend the night.

41
00:01:40,653 --> 00:01:44,053
That's very sweet, but I want to get
as far away from you as I can.

42
00:01:44,178 --> 00:01:46,531
That's okay.
I just got Avatar on DVD.

43
00:01:50,056 --> 00:01:51,506
So, we're all good?

44
00:01:51,986 --> 00:01:52,871
Absolutely.

45
00:01:53,039 --> 00:01:54,760
All right. I'll go get dressed.

46
00:02:01,669 --> 00:02:03,769
You couldn't wait till I'm gone?

47
00:02:04,195 --> 00:02:06,095
Didn't seem to be any point.

48
00:02:25,969 --> 00:02:29,955
Season 8 Episode 12
"Chocolate Diddlers or My Puppy's Dead"

49
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:33,170
Subtitle: Mr. Bo Jingles Team

50
00:02:42,246 --> 00:02:43,396
Online poker?

51
00:02:43,759 --> 00:02:45,541
Live girl-on-girl porn.

52
00:02:47,496 --> 00:02:48,838
Really? At 7:00 AM?

53
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:51,470
It's not 7:00 AM in Copenhagen.

54
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:56,226
How can you tell?
There's no windows.

55
00:03:00,659 --> 00:03:02,817
Me, I like to start my day
with a cup of coffee.

56
00:03:02,942 --> 00:03:05,026
Instant energy,
and it helps me poop.

57
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:14,445
Somebody's having
the breakfast of champions.

58
00:03:15,636 --> 00:03:17,872
They say it's the most important meal
of the day.

59
00:03:19,174 --> 00:03:22,043
Tell me Courtney isn't in your bedroom
while you're looking at this.

60
00:03:22,597 --> 00:03:24,504
Courtney went home. We broke up.

61
00:03:25,772 --> 00:03:29,203
And you're trying to fill the void
and mend your broken heart at

62
00:03:29,328 --> 00:03:30,945
DanishMunchers.com.

63
00:03:34,676 --> 00:03:37,151
- Something like that.
- So, what happened?

64
00:03:37,276 --> 00:03:39,227
Nothing happened.
It just ran its course.

65
00:03:40,107 --> 00:03:41,896
That's hard to imagine.
She's so hot.

66
00:03:42,611 --> 00:03:43,954
Let me tell you something.

67
00:03:44,631 --> 00:03:46,054
For every gorgeous woman,

68
00:03:46,179 --> 00:03:48,070
there's a guy
who's tired of banging her.

69
00:03:49,938 --> 00:03:51,638
But that guy's never me.

70
00:03:53,890 --> 00:03:55,244
I gotta get out of the house.

71
00:03:55,630 --> 00:03:57,386
Maybe go to the movies.
Is Jake here?

72
00:03:57,511 --> 00:03:59,790
He's having a party over
at his mom's house tonight.

73
00:04:00,612 --> 00:04:01,958
Did I forget his birthday?

74
00:04:02,374 --> 00:04:04,482
It's just one
of those teenage parties.

75
00:04:04,687 --> 00:04:07,672
But for the record, his birthday was
six months ago, and you forgot.

76
00:04:09,616 --> 00:04:11,176
- How old was he?
- Sixteen.

77
00:04:12,482 --> 00:04:14,471
No wonder he keeps asking
to borrow my car.

78
00:04:14,857 --> 00:04:16,666
I'll just go to the movies
by myself.

79
00:04:16,791 --> 00:04:17,905
You want company?

80
00:04:18,030 --> 00:04:20,680
Hello? That's why
I was asking about Jake.

81
00:04:31,292 --> 00:04:32,544
Good morning, ladies.

82
00:04:33,979 --> 00:04:35,752
No masturbating in the kitchen!

83
00:04:37,822 --> 00:04:40,048
What do you say we go someplace
a little quieter?

84
00:04:48,674 --> 00:04:49,896
What ya working on?

85
00:04:50,021 --> 00:04:52,425
It's a jingle
for a new kids' breakfast cereal.

86
00:04:52,636 --> 00:04:54,046
Cool. Can I hear it?

87
00:04:54,171 --> 00:04:55,071
I guess.

88
00:04:55,807 --> 00:04:59,057
Picture this over animated
dancing monkeys and zebras.

89
00:05:00,675 --> 00:05:01,525
Got it.

90
00:05:04,911 --> 00:05:08,817
Start your day with a big hooray

91
00:05:09,639 --> 00:05:12,207
Chocolate Diddlers

92
00:05:14,588 --> 00:05:18,553
Bowl of fun for everyone

93
00:05:19,502 --> 00:05:21,794
Chocolate Diddlers

94
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:25,654
Chocolate Diddlers, Yum.

95
00:05:31,585 --> 00:05:32,882
Well, I like the lyric.

96
00:05:34,623 --> 00:05:37,011
You know, it's kind of...
It's upbeat, celebratory.

97
00:05:37,179 --> 00:05:39,102
You know, "hooray, fun, yum".

98
00:05:40,643 --> 00:05:41,829
If I had a note...

99
00:05:41,954 --> 00:05:43,434
It would be the music.

100
00:05:44,143 --> 00:05:44,936
What?

101
00:05:46,017 --> 00:05:48,314
Well, it doesn't say,
"Yummy breakfast treat"

102
00:05:48,482 --> 00:05:50,993
so much as it says,
"My puppy's dead".

103
00:05:54,121 --> 00:05:57,323
- I've been a little down lately.
- I know. But keep workin' on it.

104
00:05:58,528 --> 00:06:00,827
- Well, I'm off.
- Where you going?

105
00:06:01,017 --> 00:06:03,347
To have drinks with Lyndsey
and a few of her friends.

106
00:06:03,472 --> 00:06:04,822
Have a good time.

107
00:06:05,472 --> 00:06:07,250
You know,
you're welcome to tag along.

108
00:06:07,707 --> 00:06:09,600
A couple of these women
are divorced,

109
00:06:09,725 --> 00:06:11,724
and got a few miles,
but they've been liposucked

110
00:06:11,849 --> 00:06:14,294
to within an inch of their lives,
so they present well.

111
00:06:14,917 --> 00:06:17,016
- That's okay, I got to work.
- You sure?

112
00:06:17,141 --> 00:06:19,798
For somebody like you,
it'd be shooting fish in a barrel.

113
00:06:19,923 --> 00:06:22,897
Although in this case, the fish would be
40-year-old, neurotic soccer moms,

114
00:06:23,022 --> 00:06:25,477
and the barrel would be a Bennigan's
in Encino.

115
00:06:26,142 --> 00:06:27,687
Sounds tempting, but I'll pass.

116
00:06:28,227 --> 00:06:29,189
Good night.

117
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:33,776
Honestly, think more bouncy.

118
00:06:33,945 --> 00:06:36,495
Happy.
"I love Chocolate Diddlers, yay!"

119
00:06:38,667 --> 00:06:39,449
Got it.

120
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:46,350
Bouncy, happy.

121
00:06:51,505 --> 00:06:53,328
C is for chocolate.

122
00:06:53,453 --> 00:06:54,974
D is diabetes.

123
00:06:55,099 --> 00:06:56,678
Do your kids a favor

124
00:06:56,803 --> 00:06:58,652
Buy a box of Wheaties

125
00:06:58,777 --> 00:07:01,307
Chocolate Diddlers, yay!

126
00:07:05,707 --> 00:07:07,319
That's a good day's work.

127
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,430
Veronica.

128
00:07:23,970 --> 00:07:25,680
How's life treating you, Veronica?

129
00:07:26,274 --> 00:07:27,914
Not too bad. How about you?

130
00:07:28,612 --> 00:07:30,500
That depends on which answer
you want.

131
00:07:30,827 --> 00:07:32,427
There's more than one?

132
00:07:32,833 --> 00:07:35,059
I could give you
the "Everything's hunky-dory.

133
00:07:35,184 --> 00:07:37,959
"I live at the beach, drive a nice car,
and have a python in my pants" answer.

134
00:07:38,084 --> 00:07:41,594
- Or I could tell you the truth.
- You have an inchworm in your pants?

135
00:07:42,649 --> 00:07:44,472
No, the python part's true.

136
00:07:45,475 --> 00:07:47,475
So what is wrong with Charlie?

137
00:07:48,704 --> 00:07:50,374
All right, fine. I'll tell you.

138
00:07:50,499 --> 00:07:52,791
Two bourbons, straight up.
You want anything?

139
00:07:52,916 --> 00:07:53,866
I'm good.

140
00:07:55,072 --> 00:07:58,972
I'll spare you the details
of my narcissistic, soul-sucking mother,

141
00:07:59,539 --> 00:08:01,573
my deadbeat,
oddly effeminate brother,

142
00:08:01,741 --> 00:08:04,087
and the future organ donor
we call my nephew.

143
00:08:05,163 --> 00:08:07,763
And to bring you up to speed
on my recent romantic adventures,

144
00:08:08,103 --> 00:08:09,733
about this time last year,

145
00:08:09,858 --> 00:08:12,326
I was engaged to the greatest gal
I'd ever met.

146
00:08:13,378 --> 00:08:14,878
So, what went wrong?

147
00:08:15,286 --> 00:08:16,394
Hard to pinpoint.

148
00:08:16,519 --> 00:08:19,591
It could've been my drinking,
my compulsive gambling...

149
00:08:19,872 --> 00:08:22,135
Or it could've been me
sleeping with her best friend.

150
00:08:23,045 --> 00:08:25,263
I can see
why it'd be hard to pinpoint.

151
00:08:25,724 --> 00:08:26,924
I know, right?

152
00:08:27,810 --> 00:08:28,723
So, anyway,

153
00:08:28,848 --> 00:08:31,283
she dumped me for a nice guy,
but I got right back on the horse

154
00:08:31,408 --> 00:08:33,354
and married a drug-addled stripper.

155
00:08:33,522 --> 00:08:34,939
And that didn't work out?

156
00:08:35,690 --> 00:08:37,502
Not for the reasons you'd think.

157
00:08:37,627 --> 00:08:39,327
She was already married.

158
00:08:40,984 --> 00:08:43,885
So I figured maybe I'd take a break
for a while from the dating

159
00:08:44,010 --> 00:08:45,458
and just see hookers.

160
00:08:45,583 --> 00:08:46,333
Sure.

161
00:08:48,703 --> 00:08:50,250
I'm aware of the social stigma,

162
00:08:50,375 --> 00:08:53,508
but I like to think of prostitution
as trickle-down economics.

163
00:08:53,633 --> 00:08:55,462
Actually,
it's all kind of trickle-down.

164
00:08:55,587 --> 00:08:58,048
It's very Republican,
when you think about it.

165
00:08:59,347 --> 00:09:01,429
You know what?
I will have another drink.

166
00:09:03,021 --> 00:09:04,021
So anyway,

167
00:09:04,146 --> 00:09:06,938
I take the moral high ground and try
to break up with the 47-year-old,

168
00:09:07,063 --> 00:09:09,475
so I won't be tempted to hit
on her hot, 20-year-old daughter.

169
00:09:09,643 --> 00:09:10,593
Laudable.

170
00:09:11,033 --> 00:09:13,708
But surprise, surprise,
mom breaks up with me first

171
00:09:13,833 --> 00:09:17,046
cause she finds out I still have
feelings for this broad that stalks me.

172
00:09:17,171 --> 00:09:20,721
- Next, my ex gets out of prison...
- Can I stop you a sec?

173
00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:21,900
Sure.

174
00:09:22,775 --> 00:09:23,775
Thank you.

175
00:09:24,074 --> 00:09:24,989
For what?

176
00:09:25,486 --> 00:09:29,028
I came in here tonight because
I was angry at my pig of a boyfriend.

177
00:09:29,153 --> 00:09:32,304
But after listening to you,
I realize I was unfair to him.

178
00:09:32,429 --> 00:09:34,082
There's something below "pig".

179
00:09:36,398 --> 00:09:38,298
Well, I'm glad I could help.

180
00:09:41,446 --> 00:09:42,865
How's life treating you?

181
00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:46,390
In what universe did I not hear
everything you just said?

182
00:09:47,372 --> 00:09:49,222
Nobody likes an eavesdropper.

183
00:09:59,525 --> 00:10:02,652
Dude, your party
is a total sausage fest.

184
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:05,721
You said,
"Let's not invite the girls we know.

185
00:10:05,846 --> 00:10:07,242
"Let's meet new girls".

186
00:10:07,367 --> 00:10:09,033
Exactly. So did you invite them?

187
00:10:09,202 --> 00:10:11,327
- Who?
- The girls we don't know.

188
00:10:11,496 --> 00:10:14,122
Dude, how can I invite them
if I don't know them?

189
00:10:15,817 --> 00:10:17,167
Good point, dude.

190
00:10:18,649 --> 00:10:20,299
Guess who brought beer!

191
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:27,210
This is a total sausage fest.

192
00:10:28,401 --> 00:10:29,651
Told you, dude.

193
00:10:29,776 --> 00:10:32,826
Hey, gang,
there's hot quesadillas in the kitchen.

194
00:10:33,226 --> 00:10:35,226
Charlie?
What the hell are you doing here?

195
00:10:35,395 --> 00:10:38,396
Well, I heard Jake was having a party.
I thought I'd stop by.

196
00:10:38,606 --> 00:10:40,398
To hang out
with a bunch of teenagers?

197
00:10:41,027 --> 00:10:42,527
That occurred to me.

198
00:10:43,194 --> 00:10:45,653
The cabdriver
thought it was a good idea.

199
00:10:45,821 --> 00:10:47,669
And it's a really long drive.

200
00:10:49,117 --> 00:10:51,701
There's something wrong with you.
Get help.

201
00:10:51,942 --> 00:10:53,992
First I got to get another cab.

202
00:10:54,665 --> 00:10:55,415
Taxi!

203
00:10:58,456 --> 00:11:00,460
It was nice of him to bring beer.

204
00:11:00,731 --> 00:11:03,630
He's a crazy bastard,
but he's got good manners.

205
00:11:03,806 --> 00:11:04,556
Taxi!

206
00:11:12,146 --> 00:11:13,139
Knock, knock!

207
00:11:15,202 --> 00:11:16,309
Not a good time!

208
00:11:16,963 --> 00:11:19,521
Alan, you're supposed to say,
"Who's there".

209
00:11:20,491 --> 00:11:22,690
That's okay, I'll say it.
Who's there?

210
00:11:24,650 --> 00:11:25,904
Go away, Charlie.

211
00:11:27,946 --> 00:11:29,446
Go away Charlie who?

212
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:32,784
I am very sorry. What do you want?

213
00:11:32,994 --> 00:11:34,516
I wanted to give you a heads-up

214
00:11:34,641 --> 00:11:37,294
that your ex-wife's
gonna be calling you in the morning,

215
00:11:37,559 --> 00:11:39,859
and it's not gonna be a pretty call.

216
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:46,923
You're a saint for having sex
with my brother.

217
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:51,460
- Good night.
- No, really...

218
00:11:51,721 --> 00:11:54,722
It's like taking a bird
with a busted wing

219
00:11:55,315 --> 00:11:59,065
and putting him in a shoebox
and feeding him with an eyedropper.

220
00:11:59,709 --> 00:12:01,666
You know he's never gonna fly,

221
00:12:01,791 --> 00:12:03,841
but you give it your best shot.

222
00:12:05,548 --> 00:12:06,848
Alan's the bird.

223
00:12:09,455 --> 00:12:10,572
What are you doing?

224
00:12:11,037 --> 00:12:12,187
Just resting.

225
00:12:14,405 --> 00:12:16,105
Your brother needs help.

226
00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:17,061
I know.

227
00:12:17,186 --> 00:12:19,497
And for the record,
I believe I will fly again.

228
00:12:28,690 --> 00:12:31,228
What do you want me to do, Judith?
He's a drunk with a lot of money...

229
00:12:31,353 --> 00:12:33,478
you can't control people like that.

230
00:12:34,351 --> 00:12:36,479
The best you can do
is stay on their good side

231
00:12:36,604 --> 00:12:39,427
so you can inherit their house
after they crap out their liver.

232
00:12:42,392 --> 00:12:44,968
As a matter of fact,
I have given it a lot of thought.

233
00:12:46,203 --> 00:12:49,303
Fine, I will talk to him about it.
Okay, okay, bye.

234
00:12:50,468 --> 00:12:52,113
Still think
you're getting the house?

235
00:12:52,302 --> 00:12:54,052
- What?
- Not important.

236
00:12:55,302 --> 00:12:56,743
- Alan?
- Yeah?

237
00:12:57,524 --> 00:13:00,330
- Why did I wake up in your bed?
- You passed out there.

238
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:03,583
Did we break any biblical laws?

239
00:13:07,178 --> 00:13:09,506
No. Lyndsey and I went up
to your room.

240
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:10,929
Ew, gross.

241
00:13:11,985 --> 00:13:13,343
You have sex in my bed?

242
00:13:13,554 --> 00:13:16,572
No. Actually, the romance
of the evening pretty much evaporated

243
00:13:16,697 --> 00:13:19,527
after you curled up at our feet like
a drunken Labrador.

244
00:13:21,462 --> 00:13:22,562
That's good.

245
00:13:23,125 --> 00:13:25,855
Let's play it safe
and take those sheets out of rotation.

246
00:13:27,948 --> 00:13:30,212
To put it on the record,
I'm officially telling you,

247
00:13:30,337 --> 00:13:32,654
on behalf of my ex-wife,
don't ever do that again.

248
00:13:33,022 --> 00:13:35,059
- Don't ever do what again?
- Doesn't matter.

249
00:13:35,184 --> 00:13:36,843
I've fulfilled my obligation.

250
00:13:38,987 --> 00:13:39,869
You know,

251
00:13:40,496 --> 00:13:43,164
I'm starting to think I'm not living up
to my full potential.

252
00:13:43,751 --> 00:13:44,712
Really?

253
00:13:45,158 --> 00:13:47,585
You think you can hump
and drink even more?

254
00:13:48,302 --> 00:13:49,946
No. Well, maybe.

255
00:13:51,713 --> 00:13:53,863
I woke up this morning
and there were...

256
00:13:54,051 --> 00:13:56,766
these little voices in my head
telling me to get help.

257
00:13:57,888 --> 00:13:58,687
Get help.

258
00:14:00,067 --> 00:14:02,813
- Your brother needs help.
- I will fly again.

259
00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:06,921
Better I realize it before
somebody has to point it out?

260
00:14:07,485 --> 00:14:10,650
No doubt. So, what are you gonna do
with this newfound insight?

261
00:14:10,917 --> 00:14:13,194
I think it might be time
to go back to my shrink.

262
00:14:14,610 --> 00:14:17,150
- Talk about your issues.
- Renew my prescriptions.

263
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:20,093
Much more in character.

264
00:14:26,827 --> 00:14:28,835
- Come on in, Charlie.
- Thanks.

265
00:14:31,817 --> 00:14:33,673
It's been a while.
How you doing?

266
00:14:34,341 --> 00:14:35,383
Good. Good.

267
00:14:35,551 --> 00:14:37,538
Really?
You usually only come to see me

268
00:14:37,663 --> 00:14:41,055
when your hair's on fire
and someone's chasing you with gasoline.

269
00:14:42,279 --> 00:14:43,808
That almost happened to me once.

270
00:14:43,976 --> 00:14:46,019
Thank God I was able to pee
on the matches.

271
00:14:47,001 --> 00:14:48,104
What's going on?

272
00:14:48,624 --> 00:14:51,393
Well, I just recently broke up
with this terrific gal,

273
00:14:51,518 --> 00:14:54,110
and I guess I've been
in kind of an emotional tailspin.

274
00:14:54,898 --> 00:14:56,779
Been drinking heavier than usual?

275
00:14:57,056 --> 00:14:58,907
Just glass of wine with dinner.

276
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:02,229
And how many dinners
have you had today?

277
00:15:04,066 --> 00:15:04,964
Three.

278
00:15:05,773 --> 00:15:06,539
So far.

279
00:15:06,957 --> 00:15:08,057
Okay. Go on.

280
00:15:08,642 --> 00:15:10,290
It's not just this breakup.

281
00:15:10,415 --> 00:15:13,191
For the last couple of years,
I've been trying really hard to have

282
00:15:13,316 --> 00:15:14,855
a meaningful relationship.

283
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:17,720
As opposed to picking up some
pretty little thing for a quick bag,

284
00:15:17,845 --> 00:15:19,052
shag and skedaddle.

285
00:15:20,359 --> 00:15:23,018
"Bag, shag and skedaddle."

286
00:15:23,487 --> 00:15:24,787
That's charming.

287
00:15:25,491 --> 00:15:29,005
Anyway, no matter how hard I try
to have something more lasting,

288
00:15:29,130 --> 00:15:32,230
more meaningful,
the end result is always the same.

289
00:15:32,502 --> 00:15:36,110
I got to consider the possibility
that the problem might be me.

290
00:15:36,484 --> 00:15:38,284
That's not a bad instinct.

291
00:15:39,244 --> 00:15:41,270
If I'm doing something wrong
with these women,

292
00:15:41,395 --> 00:15:43,409
it'd be helpful
if I had a clue what it was.

293
00:15:43,738 --> 00:15:46,663
If you had to guess,
what would you say you're doing wrong?

294
00:15:47,842 --> 00:15:49,783
I don't know.
I love too much?

295
00:15:51,928 --> 00:15:53,028
Guess again.

296
00:15:54,419 --> 00:15:57,507
- I'm afraid of intimacy?
- Do you believe that to be true?

297
00:15:57,836 --> 00:15:59,749
Not really.
I just hear it all the time.

298
00:15:59,874 --> 00:16:02,428
Dr. Phil, movies,
TV shows, ex-girlfriends.

299
00:16:03,102 --> 00:16:04,354
Let me ask you something.

300
00:16:04,479 --> 00:16:07,225
What do you think being
truly intimate with a woman is?

301
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:11,931
Not using a condom?

302
00:16:16,902 --> 00:16:17,652
What?

303
00:16:18,181 --> 00:16:20,307
I'm sorry.
I-I didn't expect that.

304
00:16:21,993 --> 00:16:24,813
But what I'm trying to point you
to is the kind of intimacy

305
00:16:24,938 --> 00:16:26,357
where you feel safe enough

306
00:16:26,482 --> 00:16:29,163
to be honest with a woman,
to tell her how you really feel.

307
00:16:29,698 --> 00:16:32,080
Come on!
Nobody cares how you really feel.

308
00:16:32,443 --> 00:16:34,021
What's a guy like me feel anyway?

309
00:16:34,146 --> 00:16:36,065
I'll tell you...
tired, hungry, horny,

310
00:16:36,190 --> 00:16:38,047
hungover, happy, sad and pissed off.

311
00:16:40,131 --> 00:16:42,917
And sad and pissed off only come
into play because I'm horny, hungry,

312
00:16:43,042 --> 00:16:44,470
hungover and tired.

313
00:16:45,601 --> 00:16:48,318
You know what? Let's table
the intimacy discussion for the moment

314
00:16:48,443 --> 00:16:50,525
and talk about
your other relationships.

315
00:16:50,650 --> 00:16:51,728
What other?

316
00:16:51,937 --> 00:16:54,592
If I recall, we've spoken
at great length about your feelings

317
00:16:54,717 --> 00:16:56,900
towards your mother,
your brother and your nephew.

318
00:16:57,286 --> 00:16:59,058
Pissed off, pissed off, sad.

319
00:17:00,621 --> 00:17:03,573
Sure. How about
non-familial relationships?

320
00:17:04,244 --> 00:17:06,242
Like friends?
Why don't you just say friends?

321
00:17:06,452 --> 00:17:08,898
I've got the diplomas, Charlie.
I like to use them.

322
00:17:10,703 --> 00:17:13,062
Okay, the answer
to your question is...

323
00:17:14,522 --> 00:17:16,085
I don't have many friends.

324
00:17:16,391 --> 00:17:18,087
How many friends would you say?

325
00:17:19,669 --> 00:17:21,841
I'm starting to feel
pissed off right now.

326
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:23,718
Do you have any friends?

327
00:17:24,125 --> 00:17:26,179
I'm a grown man.
I have acquaintances.

328
00:17:26,347 --> 00:17:28,181
You spend time
with these acquaintances?

329
00:17:28,349 --> 00:17:30,266
For what?
To talk about my feelings?

330
00:17:32,431 --> 00:17:36,105
I'm not one to indulge in chitchat
unless I feel it's gonna get me laid.

331
00:17:36,435 --> 00:17:39,150
I'm just saying it might be nice
to have some relationships

332
00:17:39,326 --> 00:17:42,111
that aren't based solely on you trying
to get someone into bed.

333
00:17:44,249 --> 00:17:46,366
You have no idea
what I'm talking about?

334
00:17:46,678 --> 00:17:47,728
Not a clue.

335
00:17:48,089 --> 00:17:49,869
Okay, now I'm pissed off and sad.

336
00:17:50,957 --> 00:17:53,093
Maybe you didn't have enough dinner.

337
00:17:59,024 --> 00:18:00,030
Thank you.

338
00:18:00,259 --> 00:18:02,799
You sure you should be drinking
if you're on medication?

339
00:18:03,068 --> 00:18:05,502
She wouldn't give me anything.
Said I'd abuse it.

340
00:18:05,627 --> 00:18:06,988
Where does that come from?

341
00:18:09,799 --> 00:18:10,803
One more.

342
00:18:12,285 --> 00:18:14,704
So... did you get anything
out of the session?

343
00:18:14,990 --> 00:18:16,708
Not really.
She kept saying I need

344
00:18:16,833 --> 00:18:18,948
to develop relationships
that aren't about sex.

345
00:18:19,073 --> 00:18:21,321
- I can see the wisdom in that.
- Sure you can.

346
00:18:21,446 --> 00:18:24,312
You didn't get laid the last nine years
of a 12-year marriage.

347
00:18:24,437 --> 00:18:26,499
Not true.
There were birthdays.

348
00:18:27,543 --> 00:18:29,436
Let's pretend the shrink is right.

349
00:18:29,561 --> 00:18:32,324
What am I supposed to do?
Go out and make new guy friends?

350
00:18:32,449 --> 00:18:33,532
Who does that?

351
00:18:34,703 --> 00:18:35,986
Couldn't hurt to try.

352
00:18:38,190 --> 00:18:40,628
- Hey, there. How are you?
- Good. You?

353
00:18:41,964 --> 00:18:43,483
I've already lost interest.

354
00:18:46,410 --> 00:18:48,336
Well, I can't fault you for trying.

355
00:18:48,652 --> 00:18:50,837
I'm not against having
a friend in theory,

356
00:18:50,962 --> 00:18:54,308
but I'm a 43-year-old man
who's kind of set in his ways.

357
00:18:54,571 --> 00:18:56,634
Where am I supposed to go
meet this new buddy?

358
00:18:56,759 --> 00:18:58,937
Did you consider you could have
a woman as a friend?

359
00:18:59,062 --> 00:19:01,751
Alan, have you not been listening?
She said no sex.

360
00:19:02,768 --> 00:19:05,820
Well, if it makes you feel any better,
I don't have many friends, either.

361
00:19:06,477 --> 00:19:09,157
- You don't have any friends.
- Yeah, neither do you.

362
00:19:09,446 --> 00:19:11,951
But that's my choice.
You're just a social pariah.

363
00:19:12,346 --> 00:19:14,871
And you're a malignancy
on the ass of mankind.

364
00:19:19,509 --> 00:19:21,518
You want to pick up a pizza
on the way home?

365
00:19:21,643 --> 00:19:23,796
- Pizza, really?
- Fine, what do you want?

366
00:19:25,178 --> 00:19:27,800
- I was thinking Chinese.
- We just had Chinese. How about ribs?

367
00:19:28,122 --> 00:19:31,054
- Great, but I'm low on cash.
- What's "low" mean?

368
00:19:31,409 --> 00:19:32,309
Nothing.

369
00:19:35,631 --> 00:19:37,810
Fine, I'll buy,
but I get to pick the movie.

370
00:19:38,292 --> 00:19:40,466
We don't have to watch a movie.
I TiVo'd Glee.

371
00:19:40,591 --> 00:19:43,051
Terrific. I'm alone and miserable,
and you want torture me

372
00:19:43,176 --> 00:19:44,859
with hot chicks
in cheerleading outfits.

373
00:19:45,051 --> 00:19:47,460
Singing hot chicks.
It's Wang Chung week.

374
00:19:49,398 --> 00:19:50,480
For God's sake.

375
00:19:50,605 --> 00:19:53,159
Why don't you put on a ass-less chaps
and get it over with?

376
00:19:53,609 --> 00:19:55,559
I'm not gay, I'm metrosexual.

377
00:19:55,778 --> 00:19:57,994
That's just a gay man
who can't get laid.

378
00:20:04,577 --> 00:20:07,142
Everybody have fun tonight

379
00:20:07,892 --> 00:20:10,820
Everybody Wang Chung tonight.

380
00:20:10,945 --> 00:20:14,402
The blonde chick in the red tracksuit
is really starting to freak me out.

381
00:20:15,818 --> 00:20:18,537
Everybody Wang Chung tonight

382
00:20:19,576 --> 00:20:21,451
Everybody have fun

383
00:20:22,812 --> 00:20:25,812
- Deep in the world tonight...
- I love Mercedes.

384
00:20:26,203 --> 00:20:27,353
You go, girl!

385
00:20:31,281 --> 00:20:34,281
