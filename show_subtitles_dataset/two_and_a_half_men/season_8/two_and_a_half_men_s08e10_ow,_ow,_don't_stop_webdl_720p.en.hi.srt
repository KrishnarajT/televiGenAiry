a bad time, darling.

179
00:08:36,523 --> 00:08:37,857
I was just going out.

180
00:08:37,858 --> 00:08:39,508
Well, I'm sorry,
but I have a problem.

00:08:39,509 --> 00:08:41,360
Just the one?

182
00:08:41,361 --> 00:08:43,078
It's about Charlie.

183
00:08:43,079 --> 00:08:44,313
Well, sweetheart,

184
00:08:44,314 --> 00:08:46,182
you have been sponging
off him for eight years.

185
00:08:46,183 --> 00:08:48,317
You've got to expect
a little abuse.

186

Oh, no, no, no, it's not that.

187
00:08:50,653 --> 00:08:52,788
I'm worried about
Charlie and Courtney.

188
00:08:52,789 --> 00:08:54,490
I-I-I really think she's
taking advantage of him.

189
00:08:54,491 --> 00:08:56,592
Uh-huh. And what are
you worried about?

190
00:08:56,593 --> 00:08:59,361
Well... I just said.
Charlie could lose everything.

191
00:08:59,362 --> 00:09:02,181
Oh, I see. Well, I
understand your concern.

192
00:09:02,182 --> 00:09:04,533
Thank you. It's not like
you could move in here.

193
00:09:06,069 --> 00:09:08,337
Oh, no, no, I'm not
just worried about me.

194
00:09:08,338 --> 00:09:11,106
Wait a second. You used to
beg me to move in with Jake.

195
00:09:11,107 --> 00:09:12,308
That's when Jake was cute,

196
00:09:12,309 --> 00:09:14,844
and I still had a little
bit of hope left for you.

197
00:09:15,678 --> 00:09:17,213
Okay, well, anyway—

198
00:09:17,214 --> 00:09:18,948
Alan. Your brother
is a grown man.

199
00:09:18,949 --> 00:09:20,816
I'm sure he can
take care of himself.

200
00:09:20,817 --> 00:09:22,017
I'm not sure he can.

201
00:09:22,018 --> 00:09:23,986
You should see the way
she's sucking him dry.

202
00:09:23,987 --> 00:09:25,855
I should hope so.

203
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:29,241

204
00:09:29,242 --> 00:09:32,061
Alan. There's not
much you can do

205
00:09:32,062 --> 00:09:33,462
when a graspy, greedy woman

206
00:09:33,463 --> 00:09:36,165
sinks her claws
into a vulnerable man.

207
00:09:36,166 --> 00:09:40,369

Come kiss me goodbye!

208

00:09:49,112 --> 00:09:52,047

No tongue for you.

212
00:09:53,483 --> 00:09:55,451

your credit card.

Nice to see you, Mr. Pepper.

223
00:10:24,915 --> 00:10:26,282

Just call me "the guy
banging your mother."

Well, I just want to make sure

What about him?

263
00:12:07,850 --> 00:12:09,718
Well, I don't know if
you're aware of this,

264
00:12:09,719 --> 00:12:11,520
but he went through
a bad breakup recently,

265
00:12:11,521 --> 00:12:12,905
and he may not look like it,

266
00:12:12,906 --> 00:12:15,057
but he's actually in a pretty
vulnerable place right now.

267
00:12:15,058 --> 00:12:16,892
And you think
I'm taking advantage of him?

00:12:16,893 --> 00:12:19,378
Well... aren't you?

00:12:19,379 --> 00:12:21,413
Look, I know what
you must think of me.

270
00:12:21,414 --> 00:12:23,248
Based on some of the
stupid things I've done,

271
00:12:23,249 --> 00:12:25,834
I don't blame you.
But Alan—

272
00:12:25,835 --> 00:12:29,138

00:12:30,874 --> 00:12:33,308
Well, he likes buying me
things. Makes him happy.

275
00:12:33,309 --> 00:12:37,546
Believe me, the money is fun,
but it's Charlie I care about.

276
00:12:37,547 --> 00:12:39,014
Really?

277
00:12:39,015 --> 00:12:40,816

305
00:13:57,593 --> 00:14:00,328
All right, I'm just
going to say this:

306
00:14:00,329 --> 00:14:02,663
I don't think you should trust
Courtney. I think she's trouble.

307
00:14:02,664 --> 00:14:05,366
Well, hell yeah, she's trouble.

Everything in my life
up till now, all the women,

312
00:14:13,542 --> 00:14:15,409

leading me right to her.

313
00:14:15,410 --> 00:14:17,111
I would've guessed they
were leading you more

314
00:14:17,112 --> 00:14:19,680
to a clinic of some sort,
but go ahead.

315
00:14:19,681 --> 00:14:22,216
You remember how down I was
when Chelsea dumped me?

316
00:14:22,217 --> 00:14:24,051
And when Rose got married?

317
00:14:24,052 --> 00:14:25,253
All of that was necessary

318
00:14:25,254 --> 00:14:27,121
in order for me to
get back to Courtney.

319
00:14:27,122 --> 00:14:30,825
It was also necessary for
Courtney to make early parole.

320
00:14:30,826 --> 00:14:33,027
Exactly. This was
meant to happen!

321
00:14:33,028 --> 00:14:34,495
Don't you see it, Alan?

322
00:14:34,496 --> 00:14:36,330
Courtney is just
the kind of woman I need.

323
00:14:36,331 --> 00:14:39,333

free-spirited, open-minded...

325
00:14:41,270 --> 00:14:43,971
And she can pick up a dime
with her butt cheeks.

326
00:14:45,941 --> 00:14:49,043
Just do me a favor,
and-and take it slow?

327
00:14:49,044 --> 00:14:50,344

328
00:14:50,345 --> 00:14:53,047

stupid that you can't undo.

00:15:52,307 --> 00:15:57,078
I'd meet you there, but
they don't take credit cards.

355
00:15:58,981 --> 00:16:01,015
Problem?

356
00:16:01,016 --> 00:16:02,850
She was just trying
to use me, Alan.

357
00:16:02,851 --> 00:16:05,152
Really? I'm stunned.

358
00:16:06,455 --> 00:16:08,623
I still like her.

359
00:16:12,494 --> 00:16:14,795
You know what she
wanted me to do?

360
00:16:14,796 --> 00:16:17,365
She actually found something
you didn't want to do?

361
00:16:17,366 --> 00:16:20,034
She wanted me to give her money
to pay her brother's rent.

362
00:16:20,035 --> 00:16:23,037
I said, "Hey, I've already got
one brother leeching off me."

363
00:16:23,038 --> 00:16:24,071
Right?

364
00:16:24,072 --> 00:16:26,574
Right.

365
00:16:26,575 --> 00:16:28,042
This one doesn't
even have a job.

366
00:16:28,043 --> 00:16:30,077
At least you pretend
to be a chiropractor.

367
00:16:30,078 --> 00:16:32,680
Well, I have my pride.

368
00:16:32,681 --> 00:16:35,850
That's it for me. No more
meaningful relationships.

369
00:16:35,851 --> 00:16:37,918
I'm going to stick with
the honesty and integrity

370
00:16:37,919 --> 00:16:40,988
of the traditional
hooker-john arrangement.

371
00:16:40,989 --> 00:16:43,624
Sometimes the old ways are best.

372
00:16:43,625 --> 00:16:46,661
Well, I'm glad you came to
your senses about Courtney,

373
00:16:46,662 --> 00:16:47,962
and I just want to say—

374
00:16:47,963 --> 00:16:49,530
I'm always here for you.

375
00:16:49,531 --> 00:16:50,598
I've never doubted that.

376
00:16:50,599 --> 00:16:52,633
Well, thank you.
It wasn't a compliment.

377
00:16:55,537 --> 00:16:58,873
My point was, I think you've
made the right decision.

378
00:16:58,874 --> 00:17:00,241
I have, haven't I?

379
00:17:00,242 --> 00:17:02,410
Well, of course you have.
I mean, for God's sake,

380
00:17:02,411 --> 00:17:03,994
look what she did to you.

381
00:17:03,995 --> 00:17:06,180
Yeah.

382
00:17:08,684 --> 00:17:10,668
Oh, my God.

383
00:17:10,669 --> 00:17:12,653
I got to get her back!

384
00:17:12,654 --> 00:17:14,138
Charlie?
No, Courtney—

385
00:17:16,491 --> 00:17:17,992
Oh, my God!

386
00:17:20,846 --> 00:17:22,296
Are you okay?

387
00:17:22,297 --> 00:17:25,349
Oh. I'm not sure.

388
00:17:26,501 --> 00:17:29,070
How bad is it?

389
00:17:31,306 --> 00:17:32,673
It's fine.

390
00:17:35,477 --> 00:17:38,679
I ain't cleaning that up.

You're a very
lucky guy, Charlie.

394
00:17:48,236 --> 00:17:50,270
I ran through
a plate glass window,

395
00:17:50,271 --> 00:17:51,805
and you puked in my piano.

396
00:17:51,806 --> 00:17:53,573
How is that lucky?

397
00:17:53,574 --> 00:17:55,008
You could have bled to death.

398
00:17:55,009 --> 00:17:57,277
And I could have vomited
on my suede shoes.

399
00:17:57,278 --> 00:18:00,413
Those are my shoes.

400
00:18:00,414 --> 00:18:03,250
Which is why you're lucky.

401
00:18:03,251 --> 00:18:05,685
Hey, Alan.

402
00:18:05,686 --> 00:18:09,990
At the moment,
I'm not in your house.

403
00:18:09,991 --> 00:18:12,659
All right, well. I'm going to
look at this as a wake-up call.

404
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:13,960
Good. Good.

405
00:18:13,961 --> 00:18:15,996
Courtney is bad news.
I've been telling you.

406
00:18:15,997 --> 00:18:18,131
You were right.
I was blind.

407
00:18:18,132 --> 00:18:19,533
Guess it's hard to see the truth

408
00:18:19,534 --> 00:18:21,701
when you're wearing
Japanese Rain Goggles.

409
00:18:22,670 --> 00:18:25,372
I Googled the goggles.

410
00:18:25,373 --> 00:18:26,807
Charlie?

411
00:18:28,609 --> 00:18:31,578
Courtney.
What are you doing here?

412
00:18:31,579 --> 00:18:34,314
Well, I went back to apologize
and there was blood everywhere.

413
00:18:34,315 --> 00:18:36,449
I tried every hospital
in town trying to find you.

414
00:18:36,450 --> 00:18:37,784
Are you all right?

415
00:18:37,785 --> 00:18:39,186
Not really.

416
00:18:39,187 --> 00:18:40,971
Um, Courtney?

417
00:18:40,972 --> 00:18:42,889
I think Charlie has
something to tell you.

418
00:18:42,890 --> 00:18:44,825
What?

419
00:18:44,826 --> 00:18:47,394
Go ahead, Charlie.

420
00:18:51,566 --> 00:18:54,067
I love you, Courtney.

421
00:18:54,068 --> 00:18:55,635
I love you, too!

422
00:18:55,636 --> 00:18:57,304
