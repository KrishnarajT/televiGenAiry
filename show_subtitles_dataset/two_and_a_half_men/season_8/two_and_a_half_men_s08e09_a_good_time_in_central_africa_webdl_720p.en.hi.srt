1
00:00:04,946 --> 00:00:08,146
Yeah, Hi - I'm watching your commercial for the Shakeway

2
00:00:09,215 --> 00:00:10,782
Yeah, I gotta tell ya,

3
00:00:10,783 --> 00:00:12,884
my brother does basically
the same thing

4
00:00:12,885 --> 00:00:14,886
in the shower every day

5
00:00:14,887 --> 00:00:20,625
and he has absolutely
no muscle tone in his arms.

6
00:00:20,626 --> 00:00:22,727
All right, I'm out of here.
Hold on a sec.

7
00:00:22,728 --> 00:00:24,913
What does this look
like to you, Berta?

8
00:00:24,914 --> 00:00:26,932
Your brother in the shower?

9
00:00:28,584 --> 00:00:31,002
You hear that?
It's not just me.

10
00:00:32,971 --> 00:00:36,040
Thanks, Berta.
I'll see you tomorrow.

11
00:00:36,041 --> 00:00:37,875
No, you won't.

12
00:00:37,876 --> 00:00:41,779
I told you, I'm going to a
family reunion for a few days.

13
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:44,682
But what about me?

14
00:00:44,683 --> 00:00:47,117
All right,

15
00:00:47,118 --> 00:00:49,620
let's go through this
one more time.

16
00:00:53,458 --> 00:00:57,662
I arranged to have a friend
fill in for me.

17
00:00:57,663 --> 00:00:59,830
Her name is Esmerelda.

18
00:00:59,831 --> 00:01:01,148
I have given her

19
00:01:01,149 --> 00:01:02,867
detailed instructions

20
00:01:02,868 --> 00:01:04,802
about how you like things done
around here.

21
00:01:04,803 --> 00:01:07,355
Did you tell her to roll me over
on my stomach

22
00:01:07,356 --> 00:01:10,908
so I don't choke
on my own vomit?

23
00:01:10,909 --> 00:01:13,344
That's number one on the list.

24
00:01:13,345 --> 00:01:15,513
Is she hot?

25
00:01:15,514 --> 00:01:17,148
She was in the '70s.

26
00:01:17,149 --> 00:01:19,283
I guess it's better that way.

27
00:01:19,284 --> 00:01:22,286
Yeah, it's tough enough that
you and I have sexual tension.

28
00:01:24,222 --> 00:01:28,059
Oh, by the way, you
promised me vacation pay.

29
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:30,628
Okay.

30
00:01:30,629 --> 00:01:33,381
How much did
we agree on?

31
00:01:33,382 --> 00:01:35,466
That looks about right.

32
00:01:35,467 --> 00:01:37,935
Bye.

33
00:01:37,936 --> 00:01:40,104
See you tomorrow.

34
00:01:44,242 --> 00:01:46,677
Uncle Charlie in there?

35
00:01:46,678 --> 00:01:47,745
Yep.

36
00:01:47,746 --> 00:01:49,013
Drunk?

37
00:01:49,014 --> 00:01:50,281
Hammered.

38
00:01:50,282 --> 00:01:51,582
You clean him out?

39
00:01:51,583 --> 00:01:54,535
Would I do that
to my little buddy?

40
00:01:54,536 --> 00:01:56,153
Thank you, Berta.

41
00:01:57,089 --> 00:01:59,523
All right, have a good
weekend, Uncle Charlie.

42
00:01:59,524 --> 00:02:02,426
Enjoy your family reunion.

43
00:02:02,427 --> 00:02:03,394
What?

44
00:02:03,395 --> 00:02:05,129
What?

45
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:06,163
You know, you still owe me

46
00:02:06,164 --> 00:02:07,498
for that pizza
from the other night.

47
00:02:07,499 --> 00:02:11,335
Oh, yeah, sorry.

48
00:02:11,336 --> 00:02:12,670
How much was it?

49
00:02:12,671 --> 00:02:13,904
That'll do it.

50
00:02:13,905 --> 00:02:16,540
Jake, let's go.
Your mom's outside.

51
00:02:16,541 --> 00:02:18,208
See ya,
Uncle Charlie.

52
00:02:18,209 --> 00:02:20,011
See ya, buddy.

53
00:02:20,012 --> 00:02:22,546
Thanks for the pizza.

54
00:02:22,547 --> 00:02:24,015
When did you guys have pizza?

55
00:02:24,016 --> 00:02:26,050
I have no idea.

56
00:02:28,754 --> 00:02:32,323
Hey, Charlie,
you remember Lyndsey?

57
00:02:32,324 --> 00:02:34,125
Nope.

58
00:02:37,029 --> 00:02:39,230
Hey, look.

59
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:47,455
I'm exercising.

60
00:02:48,673 --> 00:02:51,675
Oh, maybe you ought
to sit down for a minute.

61
00:02:51,676 --> 00:02:53,611
Good idea.

62
00:02:53,612 --> 00:02:56,013
I'm getting
a little dizzy.

63
00:02:56,014 --> 00:02:58,215
I hope I don't have
a heart problem.

64
00:02:58,216 --> 00:03:01,218
No, you have
a drinking problem.

65
00:03:01,219 --> 00:03:02,920
That's a relief.

66
00:03:02,921 --> 00:03:05,122
So who's this Lyndsey?

67
00:03:05,123 --> 00:03:09,827
You remember— Lyndsey,
early 40s, blonde, pretty.

68
00:03:09,828 --> 00:03:11,929
No recollection.

69
00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:13,564
I burned her house down.

70
00:03:13,565 --> 00:03:15,833
She left me, went back
to her ex-husband?

71
00:03:15,834 --> 00:03:18,102
Keep going.

72
00:03:18,103 --> 00:03:21,572
Nice, full, very natural
looking C-cup?

73
00:03:21,573 --> 00:03:23,824
Oh, right, Lyndsey.

74
00:03:23,825 --> 00:03:25,776
Here we go.

75
00:03:34,719 --> 00:03:36,187
What are you doing?

76
00:03:36,188 --> 00:03:37,488
Child-proofing you.

77
00:03:37,489 --> 00:03:39,056
Thank you.

78
00:03:39,057 --> 00:03:41,459
So you're-you're dating

79
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:43,327
Lindsay Lohan?

80
00:03:43,328 --> 00:03:46,230
No, no, Lyndsey MacElroy.

81
00:03:46,231 --> 00:03:47,648
Anyway, she called
and apparently

82
00:03:47,649 --> 00:03:49,517
things aren't working out
with the ex-husband,

83
00:03:49,518 --> 00:03:51,185
and even though she
didn't exactly say she

84
00:03:51,186 --> 00:03:53,938
wanted to get back together, I
am going to meet her for dinner.

85
00:03:53,939 --> 00:03:55,206
Well, that's great.
Mm-hmm.

86
00:03:55,207 --> 00:03:56,440
Good for you.

87
00:03:57,075 --> 00:03:59,143
How do I look?

88
00:03:59,144 --> 00:04:03,114
Like Lance Armstrong
after a three-day drunk.

89
00:04:03,115 --> 00:04:04,949
Nice.

90
00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:06,250
Mm-hmm.

91
00:04:06,918 --> 00:04:10,454
You are a good brother, Alan.

92
00:04:10,455 --> 00:04:12,523
Have some money.

93
00:04:12,524 --> 00:04:14,592
Thanks.

94
00:04:14,593 --> 00:04:16,677
If I were really
a good brother,

95
00:04:16,678 --> 00:04:18,529
I would stage
an intervention.

96
00:04:18,530 --> 00:04:20,881
Thanks for the pizza.

97
00:04:34,246 --> 00:04:37,014
Eureka.

98
00:04:37,015 --> 00:04:39,617

Me... you...

105
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:28,768
Not married, are we?

I guess if the answer was yes,

107
00:05:35,376 --> 00:05:37,777
she wouldn't be polishing
the piano.

That's Esmerelda.

112
00:05:49,623 --> 00:05:51,658
Gonna need more.

113
00:05:51,659 --> 00:05:53,259
Berta's friend?

114
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:54,260
Keep going.

115
00:05:54,261 --> 00:05:56,128
Berta went
to her family reunion.

116
00:05:56,129 --> 00:05:57,630
Esmerelda's filling in for her.

117
00:05:57,631 --> 00:06:02,301
Oh. It would have been nice
if she'd given me a heads-up.

118
00:06:02,302 --> 00:06:05,805
Aren't you going to ask me
about last night?

119
00:06:05,806 --> 00:06:07,523
Oh, yeah.

120
00:06:07,524 --> 00:06:11,027
What did I do last night?

121
00:06:11,028 --> 00:06:14,948
Somehow I spent
almost all my money.

122
00:06:14,949 --> 00:06:17,383
No, I meant
what I did last night.

123
00:06:17,384 --> 00:06:19,852
Oh. No.

124
00:06:19,853 --> 00:06:22,505
Lyndsey wants
to get back together.

125
00:06:23,457 --> 00:06:24,490
C-cups.

126
00:06:24,491 --> 00:06:26,726
Right. Lyndsey.

127
00:06:26,727 --> 00:06:28,995
She did split up
with her ex-husband Chris.

128
00:06:28,996 --> 00:06:31,347
Said she realized
she didn't want to go backwards.

129
00:06:31,348 --> 00:06:35,335
In what universe is dating you
not going backwards?

130
00:06:35,336 --> 00:06:38,671
I know. This guy must be
some kind of mess.

131
00:06:40,407 --> 00:06:42,775
Breakfast, Señor Harper?

132
00:06:42,776 --> 00:06:44,227
Why is she saying breakfast?

133
00:06:44,228 --> 00:06:46,012
Am I supposed to make her
breakfast?

134
00:06:46,013 --> 00:06:48,364
She'll make it for you.

135
00:06:48,365 --> 00:06:51,534
Try the huevos rancheros—
they're amazing.

136
00:06:58,325 --> 00:06:59,792
Muy bien.
Gracias.

137
00:06:59,793 --> 00:07:02,962
Where did you learn
to speak Spanish?

138
00:07:02,963 --> 00:07:05,415

college,

139
00:07:05,416 --> 00:07:08,668
two years of chiropractic school

The fresh cut flowers,

158

the carafe of lemon water.

159
00:08:21,709 --> 00:08:23,459
She even laid out
my robe and slippers.

160
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:24,711
Since when
do you have slippers?

161
00:08:24,712 --> 00:08:27,046
I don't know. Is it
possible she made them?

162
00:08:29,116 --> 00:08:31,484
She put a chocolate on your pillow?
Yup.

163
00:08:31,485 --> 00:08:33,386
See what it says?

164
00:08:33,387 --> 00:08:34,787
"Felicidad."

165
00:08:34,788 --> 00:08:36,222
That means
"Merry Christmas," right?

166
00:08:36,223 --> 00:08:38,157
It means "happiness."

167
00:08:38,158 --> 00:08:41,260
You sure? What about that song,
uh, "Felicidad Navidas"?

168
00:08:41,261 --> 00:08:43,362
"Feliz Navidad"?

169
00:08:43,363 --> 00:08:45,297
Tomato, tamale.

170
00:08:45,298 --> 00:08:46,599
The point is,

171
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,901
Esmerelda is
a terrific housekeeper.

172
00:08:48,902 --> 00:08:50,670
I didn't get
a chocolate.

173
00:08:50,671 --> 00:08:52,105
You're not Señor Harper.

174
00:08:52,106 --> 00:08:53,573
I'm a Señor Harper.

175
00:08:53,574 --> 00:08:56,109
Yes, but not the Señor Harper
that pays her.

176
00:08:57,327 --> 00:08:59,445
Come on, you got
to see this.

177
00:08:59,446 --> 00:09:01,581
She still could have
given me a chocolate.

178
00:09:01,582 --> 00:09:03,683
How much could it cost?

179
00:09:03,684 --> 00:09:05,418
Look!

180
00:09:05,419 --> 00:09:06,619
That's not a swan.

181
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:08,688
That's my towel.

182
00:09:08,689 --> 00:09:09,922
Nice touch.

183
00:09:09,923 --> 00:09:11,257
Had me fooled
at first.

184
00:09:11,258 --> 00:09:13,426
I tried to kill it.

00:09:14,461 --> 00:09:15,928
And look.

186
00:09:15,929 --> 00:09:18,431
She folded my toilet paper
into a little point.

187
00:09:18,432 --> 00:09:20,500
After breakfast,
I used some, stood up, shaved,

188
00:09:20,501 --> 00:09:23,336
and when I looked back,
I swear it was pointed again.

189
00:09:23,337 --> 00:09:25,171
Is that a votive candle?

190
00:09:25,172 --> 00:09:26,439
Yup.

191
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:28,541
She's praying that I have
pleasant bowel movements.

192
00:09:28,542 --> 00:09:29,942
Oh, please.

193
00:09:29,943 --> 00:09:31,110
No, no, no, it's working.

194
00:09:31,111 --> 00:09:34,413
This morning, soft, firm,
easy peasy.

195
00:09:34,414 --> 00:09:36,182
But wait, there's more.

196
00:09:36,183 --> 00:09:37,817
Come on.

197
00:09:39,703 --> 00:09:42,205
Tada!

198
00:09:42,206 --> 00:09:44,123
She bought you a new grill?

199
00:09:44,124 --> 00:09:45,725
No, no, no, this
is the old grill.

200
00:09:45,726 --> 00:09:46,859
You know what she did?

201
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:49,028
What?
She cleaned it.

202
00:09:49,029 --> 00:09:50,897
She cleaned the grill?

203
00:09:50,898 --> 00:09:52,431
Berta never cleans the grill.

204
00:09:52,432 --> 00:09:53,633
Tell me about it.

205
00:09:53,634 --> 00:09:55,902
She only comes out on the deck
to smoke pot.

206
00:09:55,903 --> 00:09:56,769
Señor Harper?

207
00:09:56,770 --> 00:09:57,937
Yes?

208
00:09:57,938 --> 00:10:00,506
She's talking to me,
Baba Looey. Yes?

209
00:10:01,575 --> 00:10:03,342
Hell, yeah, botanas.

210
00:10:09,383 --> 00:10:11,250
What's that mean,
"screw you"?

211
00:10:11,251 --> 00:10:12,718
Basically.

212
00:10:12,719 --> 00:10:14,720
I love this woman.

213
00:10:14,721 --> 00:10:16,105
Esmerelda, te amo.

214
00:10:16,106 --> 00:10:17,824
Ay, Señor.

215
00:10:17,825 --> 00:10:19,225
I thought you didn't
speak Spanish.

216
00:10:19,226 --> 00:10:21,727
I don't, but I do know
how to say "I love you"

217
00:10:21,728 --> 00:10:23,262
and "How much for
a happy ending?"

218
00:10:23,263 --> 00:10:24,497
in, like, 17
different languages.

219
00:10:24,498 --> 00:10:25,948
You're kidding.

220
00:10:29,136 --> 00:10:33,339

a good time in Central Africa.

Uh, what brings you by?

228
00:10:53,393 --> 00:10:55,294
Well, Lyndsey mentioned
that you two are dating again,

229
00:10:55,295 --> 00:10:56,729
and I wanted to let you know

230
00:10:56,730 --> 00:10:59,432
that if I had to lose her,
I'm glad it was to you.

231

Thank you.

00:11:01,318 --> 00:11:03,436
How did you get my address?

233
00:11:03,437 --> 00:11:05,004
Not important.

234
00:11:05,005 --> 00:11:06,939

Open it.

238
00:11:16,817 --> 00:11:17,884
Oh.

239
00:11:17,885 --> 00:11:19,118
Look at that.

240
00:11:19,119 --> 00:11:20,853
It's a picture of
Lyndsey and you.

241
00:11:20,854 --> 00:11:23,656
Yeah. Look how happy we were.

242
00:11:23,657 --> 00:11:25,391
We just found out
she was pregnant.

243
00:11:25,392 --> 00:11:27,810
It kind of looks like she's
glowing, but it's really just

244
00:11:27,811 --> 00:11:30,696
the lights from the Ferris wheel
on the Santa Monica Pier.

245
00:11:30,697 --> 00:11:32,999
I-I can't accept this.

246
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,834
Oh, I want you to have it.

247
00:11:34,835 --> 00:11:36,969
You need to see
how happy Lyndsey made me,

248
00:11:36,970 --> 00:11:38,771
so you can be that happy.

249
00:11:38,772 --> 00:11:41,274
Okay, I'm not quite sure
I follow the logic,

00:11:41,275 --> 00:11:43,025

00:11:47,748 --> 00:11:49,815
You're already dead.

to talk about it
on the phone?

266

Oh, it's not that
it's important,

267
00:12:28,163 --> 00:12:29,363
uh, it's just
that it's...

268
00:12:29,364 --> 00:12:30,765
Alan, if you
dragged me down here

269

to break up with me,
I will murder you.

270
00:12:32,601 --> 00:12:34,952
Oh, no, nobody's
breaking up.

271
00:12:34,953 --> 00:12:37,071
But, uh, speaking
of murder,

272
00:12:37,072 --> 00:12:39,140
I saw your
ex-husband yesterday.

273
00:12:39,141 --> 00:12:41,375
I'm sorry, "speaking of murder"?

274
00:12:41,376 --> 00:12:43,244
Oh, oh, maybe I should
back up a little.

275
00:12:43,245 --> 00:12:46,881
Um, Chris showed up at
my house and handed me

276
00:12:46,882 --> 00:12:50,484
what I consider to be a very
inappropriate photo of you two.

277
00:12:50,485 --> 00:12:52,119
That bastard!

278
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:54,355
He told me he threw
those pictures away.

279
00:12:54,356 --> 00:12:57,624
Okay, I-I don't think we're
talking about the same pictures.

280
00:12:57,625 --> 00:13:01,262
Uh, but the point is, before
he left, he shot at me.

281
00:13:01,263 --> 00:13:03,064
He shot at you?

282
00:13:03,065 --> 00:13:04,732
Oh, not with a gun,
with his finger.

283
00:13:04,733 --> 00:13:06,767
But the implication
was pretty darn clear.

284
00:13:06,768 --> 00:13:09,003
Okay, let me
get this straight.

285
00:13:09,004 --> 00:13:10,905
I wasn't naked
in the picture?

286
00:13:10,906 --> 00:13:13,207
No, you were at the
Santa Monica Pier.

287
00:13:13,208 --> 00:13:16,143
But not naked, right?

288
00:13:16,144 --> 00:13:17,745
Right.

289
00:13:17,746 --> 00:13:19,363
Uh, but again,
my concern here

290
00:13:19,364 --> 00:13:22,016
is that your ex-husband
seems to be threatening me.

291
00:13:22,017 --> 00:13:23,718
Oh, Chris is harmless.

292
00:13:23,719 --> 00:13:25,886
His bark is way worse
than his bite.

293
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:27,655
So you're saying
he does bite?

294
00:13:27,656 --> 00:13:29,156
Alan, you have nothing
to worry about.

295
00:13:29,157 --> 00:13:30,658
And if it'll make you
feel better,

296
00:13:30,659 --> 00:13:32,626
I'll talk to Chris
next time I see him.

297
00:13:32,627 --> 00:13:34,678
Talk to me about what?
What the hell?

298
00:13:37,332 --> 00:13:39,366
How long have you
been sitting there?

299
00:13:39,367 --> 00:13:40,367
I just got here.

300
00:13:40,368 --> 00:13:41,535
I was gonna come say hi,

301
00:13:41,536 --> 00:13:42,970
but I thought
it was a little creepy—

302
00:13:42,971 --> 00:13:45,039
ex-husband, new boyfriend.

303
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,240
Are you following us?

304
00:13:46,241 --> 00:13:48,709
No. I just stopped in
to have a cup of coffee.

305
00:13:48,710 --> 00:13:50,444
You live on
the other side of town.

306
00:13:50,445 --> 00:13:52,079
But I like the coffee here.

307
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:55,649
Okay, I don't know what
you're trying to accomplish,

308
00:13:55,650 --> 00:13:57,118
but it needs to stop right now.

309
00:13:57,119 --> 00:13:59,853

this, Lyndsey.

310
00:13:59,854 --> 00:14:04,241
Now... listen up, pal.

311
00:14:04,242 --> 00:14:06,360
I'm dating your ex-wife,

312
00:14:06,361 --> 00:14:09,080
and there's nothing
you can do about it.

00:14:25,397 --> 00:14:26,847
Calm down?
This guy is crazy.

326
00:14:26,848 --> 00:14:28,549
We need get a restraining order
or something.

327
00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:30,217
I don't think
that's necessary.

328
00:14:30,218 --> 00:14:31,902
Of course it's necessary.

329
00:14:31,903 --> 00:14:34,555
This is unacceptable behavior,
and I am not putting up with it.

330
00:14:34,556 --> 00:14:35,990
In fact,
forget the restraining order.

331
00:14:35,991 --> 00:14:38,109
I'm gonna pay him a visit
and make it crystal clear

332

364
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:39,970
Berta's back.

365
00:15:39,971 --> 00:15:41,755
Yay.

366
00:15:41,756 --> 00:15:44,558
I'm going somewhere
I can eat in peace.

367
00:15:44,559 --> 00:15:46,727
I thought my family
was annoying.

368
00:15:46,728 --> 00:15:48,896
Can you believe it?

369
00:15:48,897 --> 00:15:49,980
Esmerelda's gone.

370
00:15:49,981 --> 00:15:51,165
Yeah, boo-hoo.

371
00:15:51,166 --> 00:15:52,816
Lyndsey's ex-husband
threatened to kill me.

372
00:15:52,817 --> 00:15:53,934
How is that a bigger problem

373
00:15:53,935 --> 00:15:55,636
than me having to make
my own breakfast?

374
00:15:55,637 --> 00:15:56,987
I'm serious, Charlie.

375
00:15:56,988 --> 00:15:57,938
He's crazy.

376
00:15:57,939 --> 00:15:59,206
Well, of course
he's crazy.

377
00:15:59,207 --> 00:16:00,140
He's an ex-husband.

378
00:16:00,141 --> 00:16:01,175
The two words
go together.

379
00:16:01,176 --> 00:16:02,243
"Crazy ex-husband."

380
00:16:02,244 --> 00:16:03,177
I'm an ex-husband.

381
00:16:03,178 --> 00:16:04,445
There you go.

382
00:16:04,446 --> 00:16:06,113
Now, what are we gonna
do about Esmerelda?

383
00:16:06,114 --> 00:16:07,981
I mean, it's not like
I can fire Berta.

384
00:16:07,982 --> 00:16:10,651
Sure you can. Frankly,
I never cared for the woman.

385
00:16:10,652 --> 00:16:12,036
What am I gonna do
about Chris?

386
00:16:12,037 --> 00:16:13,787
I don't want to lose Lyndsey;
I love her.

387
00:16:13,788 --> 00:16:15,322
And I love
huevos rancheros

388
00:16:15,323 --> 00:16:18,008
and chocolate "felicidadas"
on my pillow.

389
00:16:18,009 --> 00:16:20,844
Okay, we seem to be talking
at cross purposes here.

390
00:16:20,845 --> 00:16:23,330
'Cause you're not focusing
on the real issue.

391
00:16:23,331 --> 00:16:25,666
I've just lost the best
housekeeper since...

392
00:16:25,667 --> 00:16:27,468
Wilma Flintstone.

393
00:16:29,521 --> 00:16:30,854
What the hell?

394
00:16:30,855 --> 00:16:32,339
What was that?

395
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:34,174
A rock.

396
00:16:34,175 --> 00:16:35,859
It's got to be Chris.

397
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:36,894
How can you be sure?

398
00:16:36,895 --> 00:16:38,612
Who else would
throw a rock at me?

399
00:16:38,613 --> 00:16:41,315
Good point. I'm here
and Mom's out of town.

400
00:16:41,316 --> 00:16:43,484
I ain't cleaning that up.

that you're not scaring me.

00:17:23,558 --> 00:17:25,276
Buenas noches, Señor Harper.

00:17:30,498 --> 00:17:32,366
Yeah, yeah, me, too.

412
00:17:33,601 --> 00:17:34,585
Esmerelda?

413
00:17:34,586 --> 00:17:37,404
Oh, como esta, Señor Alan?

414
00:17:37,405 --> 00:17:38,756
Muy bien.

415
00:17:38,757 --> 00:17:39,873
Charlie, what's going on?

416
00:17:39,874 --> 00:17:41,074
Excusez-moi.

417
00:17:43,111 --> 00:17:46,413
From now on, Berta will be
our day housekeeper

418
00:17:46,414 --> 00:17:48,716
and Esmerelda will be
our night housekeeper.

419
00:17:48,717 --> 00:17:49,984
Capiche?

420
00:17:49,985 --> 00:17:51,352
Does Berta know?

421
00:17:51,353 --> 00:17:52,786
Berta doesn't need to know.

422
00:17:52,787 --> 00:17:54,955
Uh-huh. So what's she gonna
think when she comes back

423
00:17:54,956 --> 00:17:57,441
and she sees the pointed toilet
paper and the swan towels?

424
00:17:57,442 --> 00:17:58,559
Way ahead of you.

425
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:00,561
I'll just un-swan
and un-point everything

426
00:18:00,562 --> 00:18:01,662
before she gets here.

427
00:18:01,663 --> 00:18:03,280
Then why do it?

428
00:18:03,281 --> 00:18:04,898
I mean, is it
worth the trouble

429
00:18:04,899 --> 00:18:06,400
to sneak around
behind Berta's back?

430
00:18:06,401 --> 00:18:08,769
I know it's crazy, but...

431
00:18:10,605 --> 00:18:12,439
the woman makes me happy.

432
00:18:13,608 --> 00:18:15,326
Botanas, Señor Harper?

433
00:18:15,327 --> 00:18:17,961
Oh, si... vous plaît.

434
00:18:20,715 --> 00:18:22,333
How about that?

435
00:18:22,334 --> 00:18:24,151
I'm even starting
to pick up the language.

436
00:18:24,152 --> 00:18:25,986
It's a shame the
language is French.

Alan, relax.
If Chris wanted to kill you,

440
00:18:42,377 --> 00:18:44,244
he'd just climb through your
window while you're sleeping

441
00:18:44,245 --> 00:18:46,947
and smother you
with a pillow.

442
00:18:46,948 --> 00:18:48,649
Thank you,
that's very helpful.

443
00:18:48,650 --> 00:18:51,335
At least, that's how
I always imagined doing it.

444
00:18:51,336 --> 00:18:53,020
You rat bastard.

445
00:18:54,122 --> 00:18:56,556
Berta!

446
00:18:56,557 --> 00:18:57,991
It's not what it looks like.

447
00:18:57,992 --> 00:18:59,059
Is that so?

448
00:18:59,060 --> 00:19:00,727
Then what is it?

449
00:19:00,728 --> 00:19:04,815
Uh... it's purely sexual.

450
00:19:06,401 --> 00:19:08,001
I'm not stupid, Charlie.

451
00:19:08,002 --> 00:19:09,686
I know when I'm being two-timed.

452
00:19:09,687 --> 00:19:10,921
Charlie, I'm shocked.

453
00:19:10,922 --> 00:19:11,955
Shocked!

454
00:19:11,956 --> 00:19:14,441
Berta, I-I had no idea
this was going...

455
00:19:14,442 --> 00:19:15,409
Stay out of it, Zippy!

456
00:19:15,410 --> 00:19:17,944
I'm out.

457
00:19:17,945 --> 00:19:19,680
So what do you have to say
for yourself?

458
00:19:19,681 --> 00:19:21,081
Berta, I am... I am so sorry.

459
00:19:21,082 --> 00:19:23,517
I got carried away, but I think
if we all sit down like adults

460
00:19:23,518 --> 00:19:25,185
and talk this through,
we can make it work.

461
00:19:25,186 --> 00:19:26,286
Uh-uh.

462
00:19:26,287 --> 00:19:27,654
It's either me or her.

463
00:19:27,655 --> 00:19:29,222
Oh, please don't make me choose.

464
00:19:29,223 --> 00:19:30,791
Berta, I love you both.

465
00:19:30,792 --> 00:19:31,925
Good-bye, Charlie.

466
00:19:31,926 --> 00:19:32,993
No, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait.

467
00:19:39,967 --> 00:19:41,902
It's you, Berta.

468
00:19:41,903 --> 00:19:43,437
It's always been you.

469
00:19:43,438 --> 00:19:45,605
I'm sorry.

470
00:19:45,606 --> 00:19:47,557
It's just not our time.

471
00:19:49,177 --> 00:19:51,478
Please tell her how sorry I am.

472
00:20:07,695 --> 00:20:10,464
Adios, Señor Harper.

473
00:20:10,465 --> 00:20:13,366
Arrivederci, Esmerelda.

474
00:20:14,836 --> 00:20:16,103
Okay, then.

475
00:20:16,104 --> 00:20:17,337
I'll see you tomorrow.

476
00:20:17,338 --> 00:20:18,805
Good, good.

477
00:20:18,806 --> 00:20:19,806
I'll be late.

478
00:20:19,807 --> 00:20:21,074
It's okay.

479
00:20:21,075 --> 00:20:23,110
You might want to clean
that hair up off the floor

480
00:20:23,111 --> 00:20:24,277
before I get in.

481
00:20:24,278 --> 00:20:26,730
Sure, I'm on it.
Okay.

482
00:20:34,122 --> 00:20:36,323
Oh, Esmerelda.

483
00:20:38,693 --> 00:20:40,794
No.

484
00:20:40,795 --> 00:20:42,729
No, I can't let her go.

485
00:20:46,701 --> 00:20:48,101
Oh, hey, Chris.

486
00:20:48,102 --> 00:20:50,787
Pillows on the couch, Alan's
in his room. Esmerelda!
