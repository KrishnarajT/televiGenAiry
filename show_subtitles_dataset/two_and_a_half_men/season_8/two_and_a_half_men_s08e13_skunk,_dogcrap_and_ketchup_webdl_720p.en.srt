1
00:00:10,002 --> 00:00:11,130
It's mine.

2
00:00:11,657 --> 00:00:12,407
What?

3
00:00:12,801 --> 00:00:13,951
Give it back.

4
00:00:15,195 --> 00:00:17,767
Mom, Charlie hit me!

5
00:00:21,306 --> 00:00:23,563
Consuela, Charlie hit me.

6
00:00:25,912 --> 00:00:28,192
Mom, Consuela hit me.

7
00:00:29,565 --> 00:00:30,915
Here we go again.

8
00:00:31,499 --> 00:00:33,799
I'll run away, then you'll be sorry.

9
00:00:34,417 --> 00:00:37,744
Mom, Charlie's making me hit myself.

10
00:00:41,887 --> 00:00:43,166
What are you doing up?

11
00:00:43,334 --> 00:00:45,130
Your brother's talking
in his sleep again.

12
00:00:45,255 --> 00:00:46,586
No kidding. What about?

13
00:00:46,902 --> 00:00:49,255
Some childhood dream
about you making him hit himself.

14
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:52,008
What childhood? That was last week.

15
00:00:53,526 --> 00:00:54,726
Sports Center?

16
00:00:55,406 --> 00:00:58,006
I'm making my picks
for tomorrow's games.

17
00:00:58,131 --> 00:00:59,348
Really, Charlie?

18
00:00:59,517 --> 00:01:01,630
Taking the points
against Georgetown?

19
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:06,189
You want to throw your money away,
get married without a prenup.

20
00:01:08,606 --> 00:01:10,033
You know something I don't?

21
00:01:10,158 --> 00:01:13,321
So far this year, Georgetown's covered
the spread eight times out of ten.

22
00:01:14,645 --> 00:01:15,990
You bet college basketball?

23
00:01:16,286 --> 00:01:17,784
Only idiots do.

24
00:01:19,495 --> 00:01:20,623
No offense.

25
00:01:21,243 --> 00:01:24,283
- Then how do you know all this stuff?
- I worked for a sports book in Vegas.

26
00:01:24,408 --> 00:01:27,376
Then I opened my business in the back
of a candle shop in Sherman Oaks.

27
00:01:28,996 --> 00:01:31,380
I always wondered how those places
stayed in business.

28
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:33,549
So did the IRS.

29
00:01:34,489 --> 00:01:36,010
They nailed you for running a book?

30
00:01:37,047 --> 00:01:38,584
For running a candle store

31
00:01:38,709 --> 00:01:41,891
that made a quarter of a million a year
without selling one freakin' candle.

32
00:01:44,112 --> 00:01:45,912
Okay, so no on Georgetown.

33
00:01:47,774 --> 00:01:50,115
- Alan know about this?
- He knows about the candle store.

34
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,975
Let's keep the other part
between us.

35
00:01:52,552 --> 00:01:55,822
He's kind of prissy about moral stuff
like gambling.

36
00:01:56,032 --> 00:01:57,740
- He is.
- And drinking.

37
00:01:58,566 --> 00:02:01,953
That's only because when he drinks,
he gets all weepy and then he pukes.

38
00:02:02,121 --> 00:02:03,120
And whoring.

39
00:02:03,715 --> 00:02:05,338
He doesn't have a problem with that.

40
00:02:05,463 --> 00:02:07,792
He's just cheap
and he likes to cuddle.

41
00:02:08,898 --> 00:02:11,754
Well, don't worry your sordid
gambling past will be our secret.

42
00:02:12,198 --> 00:02:14,575
- I'm glad to know I can trust you.
- Of course you can.

43
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:16,968
I never told him
about your soft-core film career.

44
00:02:19,629 --> 00:02:21,222
You saw Cinnamon's Buns?

45
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,517
Not all the way through.

46
00:02:27,698 --> 00:02:30,982
Although I am very familiar with
the bakery shop scene in the middle.

47
00:02:32,938 --> 00:02:34,193
With the frosting gun?

48
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:38,948
I was 19, I needed the money.
They promised me it would be tasteful.

49
00:02:39,116 --> 00:02:40,816
It looked very tasteful.

50
00:02:42,219 --> 00:02:43,419
And delicious.

51
00:02:46,503 --> 00:02:47,832
Glad to hear you enjoyed it.

52
00:02:48,526 --> 00:02:50,835
I don't think you were well-served
by the screenplay.

53
00:02:51,003 --> 00:02:52,127
What screenplay?

54
00:02:52,252 --> 00:02:55,388
There was just a greasy guy behind
the camera saying, "Do this, do that.

55
00:02:55,513 --> 00:02:56,813
"More frosting."

56
00:02:59,744 --> 00:03:00,756
It's weird.

57
00:03:00,881 --> 00:03:03,389
You and I have more in common
than you and my brother.

58
00:03:04,627 --> 00:03:07,059
All right, let's take something
off the table right away.

59
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:08,853
- What's that?
- My ass.

60
00:03:10,035 --> 00:03:12,027
- That's not what I was getting at...
- Seriously.

61
00:03:12,152 --> 00:03:15,526
In spite of my past, I'm just a nice
little Valley soccer mom now.

62
00:03:16,877 --> 00:03:17,927
Soccer mom?

63
00:03:18,187 --> 00:03:20,072
Your kid's a babbling pothead.

64
00:03:20,283 --> 00:03:22,867
He played soccer when he was ten.
He scored two goals.

65
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:24,911
- In one game?
- In one season. Shut up.

66
00:03:26,678 --> 00:03:28,706
The point is,
I am way past guys like you.

67
00:03:29,617 --> 00:03:31,451
What do you mean guys like me?

68
00:03:31,576 --> 00:03:34,587
Guys that I have to dip in ammonia
before I'd let them anywhere near me.

69
00:03:36,038 --> 00:03:37,217
Those guys.

70
00:03:38,901 --> 00:03:40,334
As long as we're being honest,

71
00:03:40,459 --> 00:03:42,595
I'm happy
with the way things are between us.

72
00:03:43,004 --> 00:03:45,404
Besides,
you're really good for Alan.

73
00:03:47,193 --> 00:03:50,024
You're smart, you're strong,
you're self-sufficient,

74
00:03:50,149 --> 00:03:52,337
and he's, well... not.

75
00:03:53,305 --> 00:03:54,774
You underestimate your brother.

76
00:03:54,984 --> 00:03:57,360
It's not an estimate.
I already got the bill.

77
00:03:57,759 --> 00:04:00,732
You'll see, one of these days
he's gonna surprise you.

78
00:04:00,857 --> 00:04:02,907
And one of these days
I'm gonna die of liver failure.

79
00:04:03,075 --> 00:04:04,909
Want to lay odds
which happens first?

80
00:04:06,493 --> 00:04:08,843
- Good night, Charlie.
- Good night.

81
00:04:11,048 --> 00:04:11,948
Ammonia?

82
00:04:12,937 --> 00:04:14,287
Am I that skeevy?

83
00:04:34,908 --> 00:04:38,960
Season 8 Episode 13
"Skunk, Dog Crap and Ketchup"

84
00:04:39,085 --> 00:04:42,116
Subtitle: Mr. Bo Jingles Team

85
00:04:49,343 --> 00:04:51,643
- Did Lyndsey leave yet?
- No. Why?

86
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:54,959
No reason. Just trying to keep track
of who's in my house.

87
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:57,212
Don't worry,
she's leaving very soon.

88
00:04:57,543 --> 00:05:00,266
I'm not worried.
Actually, I like having her around.

89
00:05:00,669 --> 00:05:01,716
You not so much.

90
00:05:03,131 --> 00:05:04,969
Thank you.
That never ceases to be funny.

91
00:05:06,495 --> 00:05:07,847
Cinnamon buns!

92
00:05:14,491 --> 00:05:16,648
- How did you know?
- I bought them.

93
00:05:17,587 --> 00:05:20,360
Right, cinnamon buns.
Who doesn't love cinnamon buns?

94
00:05:22,961 --> 00:05:25,323
- Alan bought cinnamon buns.
- With frosting.

95
00:05:35,226 --> 00:05:37,196
All right, honey.
I'll see you later.

96
00:05:37,321 --> 00:05:39,535
- I'll call you after work.
- See ya, Charlie.

97
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:43,007
- Has your son picked a college yet?
- No. Why?

98
00:05:44,363 --> 00:05:47,929
Well, I was just wondering
if he were to choose between say...

99
00:05:50,218 --> 00:05:51,683
North Carolina and Kentucky...

100
00:05:53,561 --> 00:05:55,205
Which one would you have him pick?

101
00:05:55,330 --> 00:05:57,214
Keeping in mind
that as a non-resident,

102
00:05:57,339 --> 00:05:59,149
Kentucky is more expensive.

103
00:06:01,651 --> 00:06:04,362
I'd still go with Kentucky.
It's a better school.

104
00:06:04,894 --> 00:06:05,864
Interesting.

105
00:06:06,249 --> 00:06:07,949
Well, I hope he gets in.

106
00:06:12,467 --> 00:06:14,167
What was that all about?

107
00:06:14,861 --> 00:06:16,875
Since when do you care
about her kid's education?

108
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:19,460
Young people are our future.
I care about them all.

109
00:06:20,777 --> 00:06:22,878
Please!
The only young people you care about

110
00:06:23,003 --> 00:06:25,592
are sliding down a pole
to grab dollar bills out of your mouth.

111
00:06:27,262 --> 00:06:29,304
Those aren't dollar bills,
those are 20s!

112
00:06:30,932 --> 00:06:32,633
And when did you become
such a cynic?

113
00:06:32,758 --> 00:06:35,948
And when did you become so interested in
the comings and goings of my girlfriend?

114
00:06:36,073 --> 00:06:37,773
Or what her kid's up to?

115
00:06:37,910 --> 00:06:39,707
- Chill.
- No, I will not chill.

116
00:06:39,832 --> 00:06:41,733
And what about
liking having her around?

117
00:06:42,104 --> 00:06:45,404
- Nothing. I like having her around.
- But around what?

118
00:06:45,989 --> 00:06:46,779
Excuse me?

119
00:06:46,948 --> 00:06:48,554
I think when you say around,

120
00:06:48,679 --> 00:06:49,929
you mean under.

121
00:06:51,431 --> 00:06:54,162
- Don't go down that road.
- Why shouldn't I go down that road?

122
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:56,030
Is it slippery when wet?

123
00:06:57,210 --> 00:06:59,167
Are you out of your mind?
What's gotten into you?

124
00:06:59,335 --> 00:07:02,572
I think a better question would be
what's gotten into you?

125
00:07:02,697 --> 00:07:04,672
I mean, who have you gotten into?

126
00:07:05,966 --> 00:07:07,634
Listen to me very carefully.

127
00:07:07,795 --> 00:07:11,304
- I've not had sex with your girlfriend.
- So it's still in the planning stages.

128
00:07:11,472 --> 00:07:12,764
But you do want her?

129
00:07:13,224 --> 00:07:14,789
Why not? What's wrong with her?

130
00:07:15,576 --> 00:07:18,186
- Nothing. She's terrific.
- So you do want her!

131
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:20,583
Believe me,
when it comes to Lyndsey,

132
00:07:20,708 --> 00:07:23,229
you have absolutely
nothing to worry about.

133
00:07:23,354 --> 00:07:25,127
That's what you said
about Wendy Freidman

134
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:27,111
and Kathy Bell and Amy Driskell.

135
00:07:27,738 --> 00:07:30,323
- Who?
- They're girls that you stole from me.

136
00:07:30,533 --> 00:07:32,450
What?
I never stole anybody from you.

137
00:07:33,386 --> 00:07:36,852
Wendy. Sixth grade, Halloween party.
I went to get her punch.

138
00:07:36,977 --> 00:07:39,499
When I came back,
you were bobbing for her apples.

139
00:07:40,144 --> 00:07:41,167
Innocent fun.

140
00:07:41,895 --> 00:07:43,356
Kathy Bell, ninth grade.

141
00:07:43,481 --> 00:07:46,115
Brought her home to work on our science
project, went to the bathroom.

142
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,567
When I came back,
you were teaching her French.

143
00:07:48,969 --> 00:07:50,218
Harmless horseplay.

144
00:07:50,719 --> 00:07:52,513
Amy Driskell, sophomore year.

145
00:07:52,638 --> 00:07:54,757
First girl who let me
get to second base.

146
00:07:54,882 --> 00:07:56,600
All right, her I nailed.

147
00:07:58,020 --> 00:07:59,270
You nailed her?

148
00:07:59,395 --> 00:08:01,312
Everybody nailed her.
That was her thing.

149
00:08:02,266 --> 00:08:04,691
It took me six months
just to touch her right boob!

150
00:08:05,299 --> 00:08:07,568
You really missed the signals,
didn't you?

151
00:08:08,004 --> 00:08:09,085
What signals?

152
00:08:09,210 --> 00:08:11,683
In my case, it was her taking off
her sweater and saying,

153
00:08:11,808 --> 00:08:14,362
"Quick, do me before Alan gets back
from his trumpet lesson."

154
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:21,040
Clarinet.
I didn't have the lip for trumpet.

155
00:08:21,209 --> 00:08:23,867
Apparently, you didn't have the lip
for Amy Driskell, either.

156
00:08:26,012 --> 00:08:27,899
But all that was a long time ago.

157
00:08:28,024 --> 00:08:29,438
You're with Lyndsey now,

158
00:08:29,563 --> 00:08:32,343
and what's important is that I wish
you both a long and happy life together.

159
00:08:32,553 --> 00:08:34,470
- Really?
- From the bottom of my heart.

160
00:08:43,231 --> 00:08:44,995
Though
I'd still like you to move out.

161
00:08:46,325 --> 00:08:47,317
Got it.

162
00:08:50,052 --> 00:08:51,402
- Soon.
- Right.

163
00:08:55,811 --> 00:08:57,118
No, I guess that's about it.

164
00:08:59,746 --> 00:09:00,872
Amy Driskell.

165
00:09:01,527 --> 00:09:04,077
"No, Alan,
I'm saving myself for Jesus."

166
00:09:08,436 --> 00:09:09,486
Come on in.

167
00:09:13,516 --> 00:09:15,762
- The place looks great.
- Doesn't it?

168
00:09:16,933 --> 00:09:20,683
Even better than before I accidentally
almost burned it to the ground.

169
00:09:23,665 --> 00:09:24,915
You're welcome.

170
00:09:25,578 --> 00:09:27,753
Come here.
I want to give you something.

171
00:09:28,512 --> 00:09:30,651
Fooling around?
On the new couch?

172
00:09:31,224 --> 00:09:33,973
Get your mind out of the gutter.
I haven't Scotchgarded yet.

173
00:09:37,261 --> 00:09:38,368
A house key?

174
00:09:39,203 --> 00:09:40,579
For this house?

175
00:09:41,063 --> 00:09:42,975
Maybe we're not ready
to move in together,

176
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:45,708
but I want you to come and go
without checking in with me.

177
00:09:48,599 --> 00:09:49,949
In a lot of ways,

178
00:09:50,074 --> 00:09:53,633
this isn't just the key to your house,
it's the key to your heart.

179
00:09:55,165 --> 00:09:56,219
Don't gay it up.

180
00:09:58,763 --> 00:10:01,724
Now listen, I'm thinking of having
a housewarming party next Saturday.

181
00:10:02,155 --> 00:10:05,353
- Great. What can I do?
- You can help me with the guest list.

182
00:10:05,521 --> 00:10:07,980
What would you say
about inviting Judith and Herb?

183
00:10:08,148 --> 00:10:09,198
My ex-wife?

184
00:10:09,323 --> 00:10:12,231
They live right across the street,
and Herb is always so sweet to me.

185
00:10:12,356 --> 00:10:15,613
Because every time Herb looks at you,
he's pretending you're wet and naked.

186
00:10:16,355 --> 00:10:18,074
All right. Fine. I won't invite him.

187
00:10:18,199 --> 00:10:21,124
- It would probably just upset Judith.
- You're right.

188
00:10:21,736 --> 00:10:23,663
You know what? Let's invite them.

189
00:10:24,093 --> 00:10:25,164
Take the high road.

190
00:10:26,516 --> 00:10:28,835
- What about Berta?
- No. I don't think so.

191
00:10:29,123 --> 00:10:31,207
- Why not?
- She's kind of mean to me.

192
00:10:31,332 --> 00:10:33,881
Honey.
That's just cause she doesn't like you.

193
00:10:35,514 --> 00:10:36,801
Fine. Berta.

194
00:10:36,977 --> 00:10:38,964
- And Jake.
- Of course. Great.

195
00:10:39,089 --> 00:10:41,089
- And Charlie.
- There it is.

196
00:10:41,933 --> 00:10:43,132
There what is?

197
00:10:43,257 --> 00:10:45,560
Why do you want Charlie
to come to your party?

198
00:10:45,728 --> 00:10:47,937
Why not? When this place
burned down, he took us in.

199
00:10:48,247 --> 00:10:51,441
He took me in seven years ago,
and I don't feel a need to invite him.

200
00:10:52,422 --> 00:10:53,422
Come on.

201
00:10:53,547 --> 00:10:56,171
- He's a great guy. I really like him.
- Of course you do.

202
00:10:56,296 --> 00:10:57,989
- All the women do.
- All the women?

203
00:10:58,199 --> 00:11:00,757
Wendy Freidman,
Kathy Bell, Amy Driskell.

204
00:11:01,727 --> 00:11:03,977
- Who?
- And now Lyndsey MacElroy.

205
00:11:05,121 --> 00:11:06,789
Charlie and I are just friends.

206
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:10,001
My brother does not befriend women,
he befouls them.

207
00:11:11,726 --> 00:11:13,296
Are you saying you don't trust me?

208
00:11:13,650 --> 00:11:15,227
I don't trust Charlie.

209
00:11:15,352 --> 00:11:17,167
For him,
you're unexplored territory.

210
00:11:17,297 --> 00:11:20,374
At some point, he's gonna try
and plant his flag in you.

211
00:11:21,083 --> 00:11:23,283
And when I say flag, I mean his...

212
00:11:25,108 --> 00:11:25,858
Flag.

213
00:11:27,962 --> 00:11:29,629
Okay, you're out of your mind.

214
00:11:29,814 --> 00:11:32,481
Be that as it may, I do not want you
hanging out with my brother.

215
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:34,650
You can be courteous to him.

216
00:11:34,819 --> 00:11:37,729
You know, like, "Hey, Charlie,
you got some vomit on your shoe,"

217
00:11:37,854 --> 00:11:40,176
or, "Hey, Charlie,
do you need me to move my car

218
00:11:40,301 --> 00:11:42,074
so your hooker
can park her pink Camaro?"

219
00:11:43,087 --> 00:11:45,124
Do you realize how insulting
this is?

220
00:11:45,249 --> 00:11:47,580
You don't get to tell me who I can
and can't be friends with.

221
00:11:47,748 --> 00:11:50,007
It's just Charlie.
I gave you Herb and Berta.

222
00:11:50,298 --> 00:11:52,335
You know what, I made a mistake.

223
00:11:52,507 --> 00:11:54,007
Well, I forgive you.

224
00:11:55,434 --> 00:11:56,631
Give me my key back.

225
00:11:57,801 --> 00:11:59,675
- Give it to me.
- How can I come and go?

226
00:11:59,844 --> 00:12:01,969
You can forget coming,
you're just gonna be going.

227
00:12:02,405 --> 00:12:04,430
But I don't understand.
We were doing so good.

228
00:12:04,599 --> 00:12:07,183
We were,
then you started talking and spoiled it.

229
00:12:08,613 --> 00:12:09,644
Just to clarify,

230
00:12:09,812 --> 00:12:12,744
you're not as angry with me now as you
were when I burned down your house?

231
00:12:15,578 --> 00:12:18,361
We'll talk after you've gained
some perspective.

232
00:12:28,566 --> 00:12:31,040
Jake, Berta, let's go!
Party train's leaving.

233
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:34,755
That what you're wearing
to Lyndsey's housewarming?

234
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,462
- I'm not going.
- Why not?

235
00:12:36,631 --> 00:12:37,964
She and I had an argument.

236
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:40,413
That's too bad.
Jake, Berta, let's go!

237
00:12:44,479 --> 00:12:48,307
If you do what I think, I swear
to God I will never speak to you again.

238
00:12:48,779 --> 00:12:49,629
Really?

239
00:12:50,123 --> 00:12:52,817
Then tell me exactly
what you think I'm gonna do.

240
00:12:53,768 --> 00:12:55,384
You know what I'm talking about.

241
00:12:56,213 --> 00:12:59,026
All right, I'm gonna run
this down for you one last time.

242
00:12:59,195 --> 00:13:01,278
I've no interest in Lyndsey
other than as a friend,

243
00:13:01,403 --> 00:13:04,031
- she has even less interest in me.
- I don't believe you.

244
00:13:04,258 --> 00:13:06,926
Okay, you're right.
I'm going over to girlfriend's house,

245
00:13:07,051 --> 00:13:09,422
- and I gonna do her right on the couch!
- No, you won't.

246
00:13:09,598 --> 00:13:11,701
- Why not?
- Couch isn't Scotchgarded yet.

247
00:13:13,837 --> 00:13:16,419
Charlie, did you remember
to get the housewarming gift?

248
00:13:16,845 --> 00:13:17,920
Jake's got it.

249
00:13:24,105 --> 00:13:26,078
- Very funny.
- We thought so.

250
00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:30,324
- How come you aren't dressed?
- He and Lyndsey had a fight.

251
00:13:30,748 --> 00:13:32,435
That sucks. See ya.

252
00:13:34,302 --> 00:13:35,980
So you're gonna sit here all night?

253
00:13:36,246 --> 00:13:37,231
I'll be fine.

254
00:13:37,718 --> 00:13:39,082
I'm sure you will, but

255
00:13:39,314 --> 00:13:41,931
if you get bored,
there's a load of laundry in the dryer

256
00:13:42,056 --> 00:13:43,363
you could fluff and fold.

257
00:13:44,154 --> 00:13:45,573
You want me to do your job?

258
00:13:45,804 --> 00:13:46,956
Somebody has to.

259
00:13:50,449 --> 00:13:54,041
Well, I guess there's nothing
left to say except you're an idiot.

260
00:13:57,112 --> 00:13:58,368
I may be an idiot,

261
00:13:58,672 --> 00:14:00,929
but at least I'm home by myself
reading Moby Dick.

262
00:14:03,695 --> 00:14:04,795
Upside down.

263
00:14:11,347 --> 00:14:12,559
Might as well.

264
00:14:15,634 --> 00:14:17,178
Maybe she'll like me better.

265
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:23,360
Where's your friend Eldridge?
He lives here, right?

266
00:14:23,485 --> 00:14:25,655
- Yeah, he's hiding in his room.
- How come?

267
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:27,634
He gets paranoid when he's high...

268
00:14:27,883 --> 00:14:29,360
ding in his room.

269
00:14:29,962 --> 00:14:31,827
I came to get him these snacks. Bye.

270
00:14:32,979 --> 00:14:33,983
Amateurs.

271
00:14:36,931 --> 00:14:38,334
- Nice party.
- Thanks.

272
00:14:38,899 --> 00:14:40,294
So give me the lay of the land.

273
00:14:40,658 --> 00:14:42,421
You mean
who in this land can you lay?

274
00:14:43,833 --> 00:14:47,551
- If you will.
- All right. Hot redhead by the bar...

275
00:14:47,819 --> 00:14:50,137
that's Wanda. Recently came out
of a terrible marriage.

276
00:14:50,358 --> 00:14:52,821
Nice, nice. What else you got?

277
00:14:53,587 --> 00:14:55,648
Pretty blonde on the couch...
that's Terry.

278
00:14:55,773 --> 00:14:57,773
She divorced her husband
to be a lesbian.

279
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:01,690
- How's that working out for Terry?
- See the dirty look she's giving Wanda?

280
00:15:04,695 --> 00:15:06,138
I think I see an opening.

281
00:15:06,721 --> 00:15:08,072
And by that you mean...?

282
00:15:08,354 --> 00:15:10,419
I wasn't being subtile,
I see an opening.

283
00:15:14,886 --> 00:15:16,081
I knew it.

284
00:15:17,290 --> 00:15:19,514
Anything good in my life,
you have to take it away.

285
00:15:20,967 --> 00:15:23,129
"Charlie, you're so funny
and so clever.

286
00:15:23,999 --> 00:15:26,882
"Why don't I lean forward so you can
look down my dress and see my boobies?"

287
00:15:27,753 --> 00:15:29,761
"Why, thank you, I believe I will."

288
00:15:30,779 --> 00:15:33,694
"So do you want to have sex now
or after the party"

289
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:38,561
"You don't mind that I'm carrying most,
if not all communicable diseases known?"

290
00:15:39,905 --> 00:15:41,939
"No, Charlie,
that's part of your charm.

291
00:15:42,342 --> 00:15:43,939
Come, take me on the couch."

292
00:15:44,531 --> 00:15:46,487
"Are you sure?
It's not Scotchgarded."

293
00:15:47,050 --> 00:15:49,400
"No matter.
We'll Scotchgard it with our love."

294
00:15:57,998 --> 00:15:59,248
Hello, Mr. Skunk.

295
00:16:01,549 --> 00:16:04,128
Don't be alarmed.
I was just leaving.

296
00:16:05,244 --> 00:16:08,132
There's, there's certainly
no reason to feel threatened.

297
00:16:09,385 --> 00:16:10,388
Good skunk.

298
00:16:11,124 --> 00:16:12,130
Nice skunk.

299
00:16:17,617 --> 00:16:18,729
Bad skunk!

300
00:16:23,357 --> 00:16:24,524
God, God.

301
00:16:35,848 --> 00:16:36,982
Who's out there?

302
00:16:38,572 --> 00:16:40,289
- Alan?
- Hey, Herb.

303
00:16:43,774 --> 00:16:45,837
Hope you don't mind.
I got skunked.

304
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:47,965
- You sure did.
- Yeah.

305
00:16:48,898 --> 00:16:50,549
How come you're not
at Lyndsey's party?

306
00:16:50,931 --> 00:16:53,625
I wanted to, but Judith came down
with a sudden migraine.

307
00:16:53,995 --> 00:16:55,762
By "migraine," I mean "bitch fit."

308
00:16:57,277 --> 00:16:58,974
- Got it.
- How about you?

309
00:16:59,650 --> 00:17:01,936
Lyndsey and I had
kind of a falling-out.

310
00:17:02,472 --> 00:17:04,490
'Cause you showed up
smelling like a skunk?

311
00:17:05,078 --> 00:17:06,800
No, no. Long story.

312
00:17:07,419 --> 00:17:08,424
I got time.

313
00:17:09,733 --> 00:17:12,507
I think she's fooling around
with Charlie behind my back.

314
00:17:13,005 --> 00:17:15,439
Charlie? That lucky duck.

315
00:17:16,303 --> 00:17:18,993
- What?
- I said, that son of a bitch.

316
00:17:20,428 --> 00:17:21,563
Story of my life.

317
00:17:21,819 --> 00:17:24,042
Wendy Freidman, Kathy Bell,
Amy Driskell.

318
00:17:24,782 --> 00:17:25,813
Amy Driskell?

319
00:17:26,127 --> 00:17:27,795
I lost my virginity to Amy Driskell.

320
00:17:30,279 --> 00:17:32,572
- You're kidding.
- Never even had to ask.

321
00:17:34,303 --> 00:17:37,763
It was our first date.
Never got out of the driveway.

322
00:17:39,392 --> 00:17:41,142
We weren't even in a car.

323
00:17:42,329 --> 00:17:44,866
Hey, you know what's good
for getting rid of skunk smell?

324
00:17:44,991 --> 00:17:46,689
- Tomato juice.
- You got any?

325
00:17:49,235 --> 00:17:51,361
- We might have some V-8.
- Think that'll work?

326
00:17:51,688 --> 00:17:53,577
It sure doesn't taste
like tomato juice,

327
00:17:54,471 --> 00:17:57,089
but you couldn't possibly smell
any worse. Hang on.

328
00:17:58,865 --> 00:18:00,372
What else could go wrong?

329
00:18:01,735 --> 00:18:02,741
Of course.

330
00:18:03,977 --> 00:18:05,512
I'm standing in dog crap.

331
00:18:08,587 --> 00:18:11,902
I can't tell you how happy it makes me
to bring two friends back together.

332
00:18:17,482 --> 00:18:18,596
Any better?

333
00:18:19,845 --> 00:18:20,895
Not really.

334
00:18:21,598 --> 00:18:23,100
Well, that's all the V-8.

335
00:18:24,071 --> 00:18:26,566
- Want to try some ketchup?
- Why not?

336
00:18:30,703 --> 00:18:32,735
I found this
in one of my son's shoes.

337
00:18:35,292 --> 00:18:37,560
Yeah,
I can get you better than this.

338
00:18:38,975 --> 00:18:40,618
That's what I was hoping.

339
00:18:41,012 --> 00:18:42,017
Lyndsey?

340
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:47,041
Alan? What the hell are you...?

341
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:49,835
Where is he?

342
00:18:50,245 --> 00:18:52,588
Where is who?
What is that smell?

343
00:18:52,817 --> 00:18:54,589
Skunk, dog crap and ketchup.

344
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:58,923
And don't try to change the subject.
Where is my brother?

345
00:19:00,157 --> 00:19:02,514
He left about 20 minutes ago
with two women.

346
00:19:03,938 --> 00:19:05,642
- Really?
- Really.

347
00:19:07,212 --> 00:19:08,771
So you and he aren't...?

348
00:19:09,002 --> 00:19:11,388
That's what I've been telling you,
smelly fool!

349
00:19:15,298 --> 00:19:16,987
Guess we had nothing to fight about.

350
00:19:19,097 --> 00:19:19,815
Hug?

351
00:19:25,308 --> 00:19:26,545
I'll call you.

352
00:19:35,223 --> 00:19:37,967
You don't scare me.
You already shot your load.

353
00:19:42,955 --> 00:19:46,112
Although I suppose
you could be a different skunk.

354
00:19:56,538 --> 00:19:58,295
All I'm saying is, given my history,

355
00:19:58,420 --> 00:20:00,634
Alan's paranoia is not completely
uncalled for.

356
00:20:00,759 --> 00:20:02,992
This wasn't paranoia.
This was insanity.

357
00:20:03,189 --> 00:20:05,615
- I know, but...
- The man was covered in ketchup.

358
00:20:07,067 --> 00:20:10,396
To be fair, there was time in your life
when you were covered in frosting.

359
00:20:11,826 --> 00:20:14,391
It's not the same thing. I was
putting myself through college.

360
00:20:15,790 --> 00:20:19,216
Look, all I know is
that Alan really loves you.

361
00:20:19,712 --> 00:20:22,053
If you ever repeat this
I will deny it, but my brother

362
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:25,752
is the most decent human being I know.
Can't you give him one more chance?

363
00:20:27,771 --> 00:20:30,274
- Well, I suppose.
- I knew it!

364
00:20:33,596 --> 00:20:35,258
You bastard!

365
00:20:35,883 --> 00:20:37,132
You slut!

366
00:20:43,013 --> 00:20:44,222
So what do you say?

367
00:20:47,330 --> 00:20:50,206
