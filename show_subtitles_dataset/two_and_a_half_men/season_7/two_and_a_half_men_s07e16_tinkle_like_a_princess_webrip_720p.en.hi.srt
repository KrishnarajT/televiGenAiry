00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:55,075
but, well, let's face it,

183
00:07:55,142 --> 00:07:57,545
that's how you made me.

184
00:07:57,611 --> 00:08:02,115
Anyway, I'm just hurting
real bad since Chelsea left,

185
00:08:02,182 --> 00:08:04,585
and I was kind of hoping
that maybe you could

186
00:08:04,652 --> 00:08:06,486
take away some of that pain.

187
00:08:06,554 --> 00:08:08,689
Even with the help
of your blessed wine,

188
00:08:08,756 --> 00:08:10,457
I can't get through the day.

189
00:08:10,524 --> 00:08:14,528
Even your blessed vodka's
stopped working.

190
00:08:14,595 --> 00:08:19,533
So, anything you can do
would be much appreciated.

191
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,801
WOMAN:
Hey.

192
00:08:20,868 --> 00:08:23,036
You got a light?

193
00:08:23,103 --> 00:08:24,905
I like a little
buzz before I pray.

194
00:08:24,972 --> 00:08:26,607
Gets me closer to God.

195
00:08:27,908 --> 00:08:29,109

It has been three days.

Please call
and let us know you're okay.

204
00:08:46,393 --> 00:08:47,828
I think we should
call the police.

205
00:08:47,895 --> 00:08:48,829
Nah, he'll turn up.

206
00:08:48,896 --> 00:08:50,998
May be broke
and riddled with gonorrhea,

207
00:08:51,064 --> 00:08:52,499
but he'll find
his way home.

208
00:08:52,566 --> 00:08:56,103
No, I-I don't think
this is a typical bender.

209
00:08:56,169 --> 00:08:57,537
He really cared for Chelsea.

210
00:08:57,605 --> 00:08:59,673
You know, he put
her in his will.

211
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:02,009
Anything happens to him,
she gets everything.

212
00:09:02,075 --> 00:09:03,644
Really?

213
00:09:03,711 --> 00:09:06,980
So, like if he swam out in the
ocean and drowned, for instance,

214
00:09:07,047 --> 00:09:08,081
she gets the house?

215
00:09:08,148 --> 00:09:09,850
The house, the Mercedes,

216
00:09:09,917 --> 00:09:11,719
the bank accounts,
music royalties.

Hey, look what
someone threw away.

219
00:09:19,092 --> 00:09:21,228
Uh, put that back outside.

220
00:09:21,294 --> 00:09:22,696
And wash your hands.

221
00:09:24,497 --> 00:09:26,967
Welcome to your
new home, baby.

222
00:09:29,336 --> 00:09:30,771
Hey, everybody.

223
00:09:30,838 --> 00:09:32,906
I want you to meet
the love of my life,

224
00:09:32,973 --> 00:09:34,441
Mrs. Charlie Harper.

225
00:09:36,509 --> 00:09:37,577
Better put me down.

226
00:09:37,645 --> 00:09:39,747
I'm not wearing panties.

227
00:09:39,813 --> 00:09:43,416
I told you he'd come home
with gonorrhea.

228
00:09:43,483 --> 00:09:46,286
All right, who's who?

229
00:09:46,353 --> 00:09:47,988
Well, this is my brother Alan.

230
00:09:48,055 --> 00:09:48,989
Alan, Betsy.

231
00:09:49,056 --> 00:09:50,958
Hello, brother.

232
00:09:51,024 --> 00:09:52,760
C-Call me Alan.

233
00:09:52,826 --> 00:09:53,894
Okay.

234
00:09:53,961 --> 00:09:57,164
He doesn't look like
such a mooch.

235
00:09:57,230 --> 00:09:58,899
Okay, well,
this is my mom Evelyn,

236
00:09:58,966 --> 00:10:00,868
and she doesn't
look like such an Antichrist.

237
00:10:02,235 --> 00:10:03,503
Hi, Mom.

238
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:04,504
(both chuckle)

239
00:10:04,571 --> 00:10:06,907
Call me Mrs. Harper.

240
00:10:07,808 --> 00:10:09,509
This is my housekeeper Berta.

241
00:10:09,576 --> 00:10:10,944
Don't call me at all.

242
00:10:11,011 --> 00:10:14,181
And lastly, this is Jake.

243
00:10:14,247 --> 00:10:14,982

244
00:10:15,048 --> 00:10:17,217
Oh, are you my son?

245
00:10:17,284 --> 00:10:21,021
I'll be whatever
you want me to be.

246
00:10:21,955 --> 00:10:24,124
Um, actually,
he's my son.

247
00:10:24,191 --> 00:10:26,193
Butt out, Dad.

248
00:10:26,259 --> 00:10:29,362
Well, you've met
everybody.

249
00:10:29,429 --> 00:10:31,298
Why don't we go upstairs
and continue the honeymoon.

250
00:10:31,364 --> 00:10:33,701

We have an upstairs?

CHARLIE:
Yep.

252
00:10:34,902 --> 00:10:37,037
Are there people
up here, too?

253
00:10:41,775 --> 00:10:43,510

Mm-hmm?

Do I call Uncle Charlie's
new wife Betsy or Aunt Betsy?

257
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:54,788
I guess either one's okay.

258
00:10:54,855 --> 00:10:56,523
I'm gonna go

259
00:10:56,589 --> 00:10:58,158
Fine.

260
00:10:58,225 --> 00:11:01,394
Aunt Betsy made a lot of noise
last night.

261
00:11:01,461 --> 00:11:03,496
Uh, yeah, yeah, she did.

262
00:11:03,563 --> 00:11:05,632

00:11:10,203 --> 00:11:11,304
How we doing today?

266
00:11:11,371 --> 00:11:12,873
Good.
Good.

267
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:14,141
Will Aunt Betsy be joining us

268
00:11:14,207 --> 00:11:16,844
or is she taking
a hot, soapy shower?

269
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:19,179
She'll be right down.

270
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:23,283
So, based on this
latest turn of events,

271
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:26,386
would it be fair to say
you're over Chelsea?

272
00:11:26,453 --> 00:11:28,956
Oh, absolutely.

273
00:11:29,022 --> 00:11:31,258
Betsy and I are soul mates.

274
00:11:31,324 --> 00:11:33,026
Soul mates. Uh-huh.

275
00:11:33,093 --> 00:11:35,095
So, where'd you meet
your soul mate?

276
00:11:35,162 --> 00:11:36,263
Guess.

277
00:11:36,329 --> 00:11:37,530
Strip club?

278
00:11:37,597 --> 00:11:39,466
Wrong.

279
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:41,368
Massage parlor?

280
00:11:41,434 --> 00:11:43,303
Wrong.

281
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:46,006
Okay, I give up.

282
00:11:46,073 --> 00:11:48,708
Betsy and I met in church.

283
00:11:48,776 --> 00:11:50,143
So what, she's a nun?

284
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:53,413
No, she's a stripper
and part-time masseuse.

285
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:57,250
See, I drove to the strip club,
but the parking lot was full

286
00:11:57,317 --> 00:11:59,386
so I circled the block
looking for a spot

287
00:11:59,452 --> 00:12:02,890
and found one right in front
of this little church.

288
00:12:02,956 --> 00:12:04,691
And for some reason—
I don't know why—

289
00:12:04,758 --> 00:12:06,059
I got out of my car,

290
00:12:06,126 --> 00:12:07,895
walked into the church
and started praying.

291
00:12:07,961 --> 00:12:09,930
Are you saying
God sent you Betsy?

292
00:12:09,997 --> 00:12:11,899
I think he did.
Oh, Dad,

293
00:12:11,965 --> 00:12:13,600
we gotta get our asses
to church.

294
00:12:15,068 --> 00:12:17,570
Then when I'm done,
I get up to leave

295
00:12:17,637 --> 00:12:19,172
and she appears in front of me

296
00:12:19,239 --> 00:12:22,075
like some kind of
vanilla-scented angel.

297
00:12:22,142 --> 00:12:23,977
Mmm, vanilla.

298
00:12:24,044 --> 00:12:25,678
So, we got to talking.

299
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:27,948
Turns out she's going through
a difficult time as well.

300
00:12:28,015 --> 00:12:29,549
Next thing I know,

301
00:12:29,616 --> 00:12:31,184
we're cleaning out
her locker at the strip club

302
00:12:31,251 --> 00:12:32,519
and driving to Vegas.

303
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:34,287
Where you got married.

304
00:12:34,354 --> 00:12:36,389
I understand your skepticism,

305
00:12:36,456 --> 00:12:38,859
but I'm telling you
this girl is special.

306
00:12:38,926 --> 00:12:41,461
She's really sweet
and spiritual.

307
00:12:41,528 --> 00:12:42,429

308
00:12:42,495 --> 00:12:44,231
In here, baby.

309
00:12:44,297 --> 00:12:45,999
Good news, bad news.

310
00:12:46,066 --> 00:12:47,968
I got my period.

311
00:12:48,035 --> 00:12:49,069
Oh, that's okay.

312
00:12:49,136 --> 00:12:49,903
We can take a break.

313
00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:51,304
We don't have to.

314
00:12:51,371 --> 00:12:53,974
There's more than one way
to skin a cat.

315
00:12:54,041 --> 00:12:57,644
Oh, you are so wonderful.

316
00:12:57,710 --> 00:12:58,846
What are the other ways?

317
00:12:58,912 --> 00:13:00,713
Shh! Uh...

318
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:02,515
Charlie, uh, can I talk to
you in private for a minute?

319
00:13:02,582 --> 00:13:03,483
Sure.

320
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:05,518

321
00:13:05,585 --> 00:13:07,420

322
00:13:07,487 --> 00:13:08,588
Okay.

323
00:13:08,655 --> 00:13:09,522
Morning, son.

324
00:13:09,589 --> 00:13:11,424
Morning, Mom.

325
00:13:11,491 --> 00:13:14,127
So, I was gonna do a little
topless sunbathing later.

326
00:13:14,194 --> 00:13:17,197
You're welcome to join me.

327
00:13:17,264 --> 00:13:20,367
Okay, not to put too
fine a point on it,

328
00:13:20,433 --> 00:13:21,902
but you're out of your mind.

329
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:24,271
You need to call a lawyer

330
00:13:24,337 --> 00:13:26,039
and get this marriage annulled
immediately.

331
00:13:26,106 --> 00:13:27,975
I knew you wouldn't understand.

332
00:13:28,041 --> 00:13:29,943
Oh, I understand, I understand.

333
00:13:30,010 --> 00:13:31,578
You're still reeling
from losing Chelsea

334
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:32,846
and you're trying
to fill the void

335
00:13:32,913 --> 00:13:34,547
with a menstruating pole dancer.

336
00:13:34,614 --> 00:13:37,450
Hey, hey, hey, that's
my wife you're talking about.

Oh, damn it, Charlie, you
don't know anything about her.

338
00:13:39,319 --> 00:13:42,990
I know I love her and she
loves me for exactly who I am.

339
00:13:43,056 --> 00:13:44,324
She doesn't want to change me.

340
00:13:44,391 --> 00:13:46,793
Oh, stop it.

341
00:13:48,395 --> 00:13:50,830
Okay, you get one of those.

342
00:13:50,898 --> 00:13:53,766
Next time, that hand
comes back a bloody stump.

343
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:56,103

I'm begging you.

No, I'm doing the right thing.

You're lucky
you're not a girl.

346
00:14:02,042 --> 00:14:05,212
Having a hoochie
is like owning a vintage car.

347
00:14:05,278 --> 00:14:07,014
A lot of maintenance
and once a month

348
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:09,649
you gotta put down
an oil pan.

349
00:14:12,619 --> 00:14:14,854

made a mistake.

00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:42,015
Thank you.

362
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:45,318
What are you doing?

363
00:14:45,385 --> 00:14:47,220
I'm just trying to be polite.

364
00:14:47,287 --> 00:14:50,290
Did you ever consider that maybe
she doesn't want to see him?

365
00:14:50,357 --> 00:14:52,892
Watch your tone, mister.

366
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:55,295
Sit, please.

367
00:14:56,930 --> 00:14:59,832
Sorry the place is a mess,
we're still decorating.

368
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:02,469
I'm decorating, he's critiquing.

369
00:15:02,535 --> 00:15:05,238
What, I can have opinions.

370
00:15:05,305 --> 00:15:09,242
He wants me to just shut up
and be pretty.

371
00:15:09,309 --> 00:15:11,478
So, listen,

372
00:15:11,544 --> 00:15:14,247
I'm sorry things didn't
pan out with you and Chels.

373
00:15:14,314 --> 00:15:15,748
Me, too.

374
00:15:15,815 --> 00:15:17,985
Relationships can be
a lot of work.

375
00:15:18,051 --> 00:15:20,720
Even if you've known
someone for 40 years.

376
00:15:20,787 --> 00:15:21,955
That's right.

377
00:15:22,022 --> 00:15:24,857
People get set
in their pigheaded ways.

378
00:15:26,159 --> 00:15:27,961
You want to get something
off your chest, hmm,

379
00:15:28,028 --> 00:15:29,562
I'm right here.

380
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:32,899
You really want to open
this kettle of fish now?

381
00:15:32,966 --> 00:15:35,135
Oh, yeah, let's open it up,
open it up.

382
00:15:35,202 --> 00:15:36,970
Okay.

383
00:15:37,037 --> 00:15:40,107
I'm just saying that two grown
men should be able to pick out

384
00:15:40,173 --> 00:15:43,643
a club chair without it
turning into Iwo freakin' Jima!

385
00:15:43,710 --> 00:15:46,246
Well, I'm not the one
that thinks that everything

386
00:15:46,313 --> 00:15:49,749
he sits his ass on
has to be made out of leather.

387
00:15:50,717 --> 00:15:52,052
Lucky for you!

388
00:15:53,253 --> 00:15:55,255
CHELSEA:
Come on, Skipper.

389
00:15:56,656 --> 00:15:59,559
Charlie?
I'm sorry to drop in like this.

390
00:15:59,626 --> 00:16:01,228
I just really needed to see you.

391
00:16:01,294 --> 00:16:03,363
Okay, what's going on?

392
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:04,931
Uh, well...

393
00:16:04,998 --> 00:16:06,333
Uh, why don't we go
in the other room

394
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:08,768
and leave these
two alone?
Fine, fine.

395
00:16:08,835 --> 00:16:11,704
There's no law that says we
can't order the area rug later

396
00:16:11,771 --> 00:16:13,540
and get two club chairs.

397
00:16:13,606 --> 00:16:14,707
You see, right there.

398
00:16:14,774 --> 00:16:16,843
That's why I love you.

399
00:16:18,878 --> 00:16:20,447
What are you doing here?

400
00:16:20,513 --> 00:16:23,016
Okay, well,

401
00:16:23,083 --> 00:16:25,518
I don't know
how to say this

402
00:16:25,585 --> 00:16:27,987
except just to say it.

403
00:16:28,055 --> 00:16:31,058
I still love you very much,
and I miss you like crazy.

404
00:16:31,124 --> 00:16:32,425
I miss you too, Charlie.

405
00:16:32,492 --> 00:16:33,760
Then what are we doing?

406
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:35,228
Taking some time to figure out

407
00:16:35,295 --> 00:16:36,629
if we're meant to be together.

408
00:16:36,696 --> 00:16:38,731
And how the hell
are we supposed to do that?

409
00:16:38,798 --> 00:16:40,067
I don't know.

410
00:16:40,133 --> 00:16:42,001
I guess we should start
dating other people.

411
00:16:42,069 --> 00:16:44,304
What?

412
00:16:45,338 --> 00:16:49,909
I'm not ready
to see other people.

413
00:16:49,976 --> 00:16:52,812
I don't know that I am either,
but I think we have to try.

414
00:16:52,879 --> 00:16:56,783
Chelsea, I can't even
think about dating right now.

415
00:16:56,849 --> 00:16:58,418
Can I tell you something

416
00:16:58,485 --> 00:17:00,120
I've learned about myself
since we split up?

417
00:17:00,187 --> 00:17:02,955
Sure, but first, marry me.
No.

418
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:04,324
Okay, just checking.

419
00:17:04,391 --> 00:17:06,893
Probably some legal
complications, anyway.

420
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:08,528
What?
Nothing, nothing.

421
00:17:08,595 --> 00:17:09,662
Go ahead.

422
00:17:09,729 --> 00:17:10,863
I've learned that

423
00:17:10,930 --> 00:17:12,332
I shouldn't have
tried to change you.

424
00:17:12,399 --> 00:17:14,301
What you need is someone
who loves you for you.

425
00:17:14,367 --> 00:17:17,470
No, no, no, no, no, no.
I need to be changed.

426
00:17:17,537 --> 00:17:20,407
There's something
seriously wrong with me.

427
00:17:20,473 --> 00:17:23,343
Please, Chelsea, take me back
and turn me into someone else.

428
00:17:24,844 --> 00:17:26,979
That wasn't a very good
argument, was it?

429
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:28,014
Nope.

430
00:17:28,081 --> 00:17:32,452
Well, that's the best I got.

431
00:17:33,553 --> 00:17:38,225
Okay, I guess
I should get going.

432
00:17:38,291 --> 00:17:40,760
I'm really sorry.

433
00:17:40,827 --> 00:17:42,195
That's all right.

434
00:17:42,262 --> 00:17:44,797
Say good-bye to your dad
and Ed for me.

435
00:17:44,864 --> 00:17:46,566
I will.

436
00:17:46,633 --> 00:17:48,568
They're a really cute couple.

437
00:17:48,635 --> 00:17:50,237
I guess.

438
00:17:50,303 --> 00:17:51,704
It's a little weird for me.

439
00:17:51,771 --> 00:17:54,707
Well sure, you're probably
used to seeing your dad

440
00:17:54,774 --> 00:17:58,145
with your mom and not
a big, handsome black guy.

441
00:17:58,211 --> 00:18:00,547
He is handsome.

442
00:18:06,553 --> 00:18:08,020
Hey, Chels...

443
00:18:09,656 --> 00:18:13,393
I just want you to know
that if by chance you should

444
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:15,428
do something crazy and stupid

445
00:18:15,495 --> 00:18:19,166
like running off
and marrying some stranger,

446
00:18:19,232 --> 00:18:23,035
I would forgive you and
take you back with open arms.

447
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:24,604
Good to know.

448
00:18:24,671 --> 00:18:27,874
Seriously, I wouldn't
hold it against you at all.

449
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:29,876
Thank you.

450
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:34,314
All right then.

451
00:18:34,381 --> 00:18:35,682
Good-bye.

452
00:18:35,748 --> 00:18:37,184
Bye.

453
00:18:42,855 --> 00:18:45,458
TOM (giggling):
Stop it, Ed!

454
00:18:45,525 --> 00:18:48,228
Your beard tickles!

455
00:18:48,295 --> 00:18:52,098
Come on, Skipper,

What's up?

460
00:19:05,278 --> 00:19:07,314
This is Betsy's husband.

461
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:08,715
Hello.

462
00:19:08,781 --> 00:19:10,550
Want to catch me up?

463
00:19:10,617 --> 00:19:12,051
Really?

464
00:19:12,118 --> 00:19:14,687
Calling him Betsy's husband
didn't do the trick?

465
00:19:14,754 --> 00:19:16,122
I don't understand.

466
00:19:16,189 --> 00:19:18,124
She never said anything
about being married.

467
00:19:18,191 --> 00:19:19,792
She never does.

468
00:19:19,859 --> 00:19:21,027
This has happened before?

469
00:19:21,093 --> 00:19:22,829
Oh, yes.
Any time I find her wedding ring

470
00:19:22,895 --> 00:19:24,297
inside her empty diaphragm case,

471
00:19:24,364 --> 00:19:27,367
I know she's off
on one of her little adventures.

472
00:19:27,434 --> 00:19:29,569
I don't believe this.

473
00:19:29,636 --> 00:19:30,770
Why do you put up with it?

474
00:19:30,837 --> 00:19:32,138
Hey, look at me.

475
00:19:32,205 --> 00:19:33,773
I'd rather share
a girl like Betsy

476
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,007
than have an
exclusive relationship

477
00:19:35,074 --> 00:19:37,310
with a box of old
porn magazines.

478
00:19:37,377 --> 00:19:38,811
I hear you.

479
00:19:38,878 --> 00:19:40,547
That would be sad.

480
00:19:40,613 --> 00:19:42,282
BETSY:
Hey, baby.

481
00:19:42,349 --> 00:19:44,050
Hey.
Hey.

482
00:19:44,116 --> 00:19:47,153
Charlie,
I'm really sorry.

483
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:49,822
I was less than honest with you.

484
00:19:49,889 --> 00:19:54,394
Sure, let's call it
less than honest.

485
00:19:54,461 --> 00:19:57,464
I did enjoy our honeymoon.

486
00:19:57,530 --> 00:19:58,998
Me, too.

487
00:19:59,065 --> 00:20:01,334
We stayed at Bellagio.

488
00:20:01,401 --> 00:20:02,869
Nice!

489
00:20:04,871 --> 00:20:06,439
We should go.

490
00:20:09,542 --> 00:20:11,378
Bye.
Bye.

491
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:16,783
I'll make it up to you
in the car.

492
00:20:16,849 --> 00:20:21,954
Oh, Betsy, I'm the luckiest guy
in the world.

493
00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:25,958
How about that.

494
00:20:26,025 --> 00:20:29,962
I guess I'm not married.

495
00:20:30,029 --> 00:20:32,031
I guess not.

496
00:20:32,098 --> 00:20:33,533
You know what that means.

497
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:36,403
Going back to church?

498
00:20:39,939 --> 00:20:42,909
That means I just got
three days of unbelievable sex

499
00:20:42,975 --> 00:20:45,612
with no obligations
and no commitment.

500
00:20:45,678 --> 00:20:49,015
Please don't make me
slap you again.

501
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:51,718
Nah, go ahead.

502
00:20:51,784 --> 00:20:53,286
I think I got one more coming.

503
00:20:53,353 --> 00:20:54,754
That's all right.

504
00:20:54,821 --> 00:20:57,089
I'm happy that things
worked out for you.
