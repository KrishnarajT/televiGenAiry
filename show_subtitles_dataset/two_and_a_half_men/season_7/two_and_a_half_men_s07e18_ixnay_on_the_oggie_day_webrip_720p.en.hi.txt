00:00:01,415 --> 00:00:03,083
♪ Men.

2
00:00:03,151 --> 00:00:04,952
Yes, Judith, I did deduct $30

3
00:00:05,018 --> 00:00:07,588
from your child support
check this month.

4
00:00:07,655 --> 00:00:11,592
Because I paid
for Jake's haircut.

5
00:00:11,659 --> 00:00:13,093
Yes, it is usually nine dollars,

6
00:00:13,161 --> 00:00:15,429
but he wanted to go someplace
without hobbyhorses.

7
00:00:17,498 --> 00:00:20,100
I know he's never gonna win
any beauty contests,

8
00:00:20,168 --> 00:00:22,470
but he is our son.

9
00:00:22,536 --> 00:00:25,105
Look, I've got a patient.
I got to go.

10
00:00:25,173 --> 00:00:27,908
Sorry you had to hear that.

11
00:00:29,510 --> 00:00:30,911
That's, uh, that's my ex-wife.

12
00:00:32,946 --> 00:00:34,348
Bee-yatch.

13
00:00:39,187 --> 00:00:40,388
Hello, Mrs. Honeycutt.
I'm Dr. Harper.

14
00:00:40,454 --> 00:00:41,789
Doctor.

15
00:00:41,855 --> 00:00:44,992
Okay, so you are having
spasms in your lower back?

16
00:00:45,058 --> 00:00:46,494
Yeah, it's awful.

17
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:48,496
Some days I can't
even get out of bed.

18
00:00:48,562 --> 00:00:49,730
Oh, I know how that is.

19
00:00:49,797 --> 00:00:51,599
You have back problems, too?

20
00:00:51,665 --> 00:00:54,101
No.

21
00:00:54,168 --> 00:00:55,803
Anyway, why don't
you lie face down,

22
00:00:55,869 --> 00:00:57,905
and we'll see if we
can locate the problem.

23
00:00:57,971 --> 00:00:59,072
I've tried everything.

24
00:00:59,139 --> 00:01:00,974
Acupuncture,

25
00:01:01,041 --> 00:01:02,810
yoga, shiatsu.

26
00:01:02,876 --> 00:01:04,345
Nothing seems to work.

27
00:01:04,412 --> 00:01:05,713
Not surprised.

28
00:01:05,779 --> 00:01:08,582
Those Eastern practices
are mostly hooey.

29
00:01:08,649 --> 00:01:10,117
Modern chiropractic,
on the other hand,

30
00:01:10,184 --> 00:01:12,920
is built on over 50 years
of solid science.

31
00:01:12,986 --> 00:01:17,891
Okay, let's take a look
at what we've got here.

32
00:01:17,958 --> 00:01:19,960
Okay, now is this
too much pressure?

33
00:01:20,027 --> 00:01:21,962
No.

34
00:01:22,029 --> 00:01:23,030
Okay, how about this?

35
00:01:23,096 --> 00:01:24,498
No.

36
00:01:24,565 --> 00:01:26,900
Okay, now is this
where the spasms occur?

37
00:01:26,967 --> 00:01:28,068
A little lower.

38
00:01:28,135 --> 00:01:29,136
Okay.

39
00:01:29,203 --> 00:01:30,170
Here?

40
00:01:30,238 --> 00:01:31,339
(moans) Lower.

41
00:01:31,405 --> 00:01:32,440
Here?

42
00:01:32,506 --> 00:01:33,541
(loud moan)

43
00:01:33,607 --> 00:01:34,875
Am I hurting you?

44
00:01:34,942 --> 00:01:37,177
No! God, no!

45
00:01:37,245 --> 00:01:38,779
(erotic moaning)

46
00:01:38,846 --> 00:01:42,149
Nobody's touched me like this
since my husband died.

47
00:01:42,216 --> 00:01:44,752
Oh, um, I'm so sorry.

48
00:01:44,818 --> 00:01:46,454
Um, how long has
it been since...?

49
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:48,522
(loud moan)
That long, huh?

50
00:01:48,589 --> 00:01:50,924
(loud moaning)

51
00:01:50,991 --> 00:01:54,328
Oh, my, it's, uh, pretty...
pretty sensitive here.

52
00:01:54,395 --> 00:01:55,429
Harder!

53
00:01:55,496 --> 00:01:58,599
Oh, okay, no problem. Um...

54
00:01:58,666 --> 00:02:01,569
So, just out of curiosity,
how did you find me?

55
00:02:01,635 --> 00:02:03,737
Uh, referral?
Uh, my Web site?

56
00:02:03,804 --> 00:02:05,639
Or the fliers
on the counter

57
00:02:05,706 --> 00:02:07,541
of the Mongolian barbecue
across the street?

58
00:02:07,608 --> 00:02:09,076
Shut up and rub!

59
00:02:09,142 --> 00:02:11,912
Uh, I'm not technically rubbing.

60
00:02:11,979 --> 00:02:13,814
(loud moaning)
ALAN: Whoa!
Whoa, Nellie. Whoa!

61
00:02:13,881 --> 00:02:16,216
MRS. HONEYCUTT:
Don't stop!
I'm not stopping.

62
00:02:16,284 --> 00:02:17,351
Oh, spank me!

63
00:02:17,418 --> 00:02:19,387
ALAN:
I'm-I'm sorry?

64
00:02:19,453 --> 00:02:21,755
MRS. HONEYCUTT:
Spank my lonely ass!

65
00:02:21,822 --> 00:02:24,191
ALAN:
What?
Do it, bitch!

66
00:02:24,258 --> 00:02:26,994
(slap)
Yes, Doctor, harder!

67
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:27,961
(loud slap)
Yes!

68
00:02:28,028 --> 00:02:33,166
(slapping continues)
Oh, God, yes!

69
00:02:33,233 --> 00:02:34,968
(slapping stops)

70
00:02:48,982 --> 00:02:51,752
Okay, let's take a look
at the schedule.

71
00:02:51,819 --> 00:02:55,255
See what the, uh, rest of
the afternoon looks like.

72
00:02:55,323 --> 00:02:57,124
Oh, that's not too bad.

73
00:02:58,692 --> 00:03:01,161
So, how are you liking
your first day at work here?

74
00:03:01,228 --> 00:03:02,996
(door opening)

75
00:03:04,264 --> 00:03:05,833
Thank you, Dr. Harper.

76
00:03:05,899 --> 00:03:07,868
Uh, you are most welcome.

77
00:03:07,935 --> 00:03:11,705
A-And remember, alternating
an ice pack with a heating pad

78
00:03:11,772 --> 00:03:13,574
is, uh, very helpful
for spasming.

79
00:03:13,641 --> 00:03:15,476
I'd like to make
another appointment.

80
00:03:15,543 --> 00:03:16,810
Oh, sure, sure. Uh...

81
00:03:16,877 --> 00:03:19,146
What were you thinking?
Maybe next week, or...?

82
00:03:19,212 --> 00:03:20,381
Tonight.

83
00:03:20,448 --> 00:03:21,482
Uh, tonight?

84
00:03:21,549 --> 00:03:23,817
Oh, oh, gloriosky.

85
00:03:23,884 --> 00:03:27,521
Uh, uh... well, we, uh...
we close up at 5:00, so...

86
00:03:27,588 --> 00:03:29,690
So I can expect you
at my place at 9:00.

87
00:03:29,757 --> 00:03:33,160
Oh, gee. Uh, I-I don't
do house calls.

88
00:03:34,161 --> 00:03:36,364
Per se.

89
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:37,965
See you at 9:00.

90
00:03:40,501 --> 00:03:43,103
(door opens and closes)

91
00:03:45,305 --> 00:03:48,609
Uh, some patients pay in cash.

92
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:53,246
Uh, uh, their insurance, uh,
won't cover chiropractic.

93
00:03:53,313 --> 00:03:57,418
Uh, part of our ongoing
health care crisis.

94
00:03:57,485 --> 00:03:59,052
Tragic, really.

95
00:04:01,288 --> 00:04:04,992
Uh, by the way, you are doing
one heck of a job.

96
00:04:06,527 --> 00:04:08,596
In fact, here's a little
something for you.

97
00:04:09,963 --> 00:04:12,099
Just 'cause your smile
lights up the place.

98
00:04:13,501 --> 00:04:15,803
You know what?
Let's sweeten the pot.

99
00:04:16,704 --> 00:04:18,906
Um, can you give me ten back?

100
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,742
Not a problem.

101
00:04:21,809 --> 00:04:23,977
Can't put a price on a smile.

Thanks.

111
00:04:58,011 --> 00:04:59,747
It's fashion forward.

112
00:04:59,813 --> 00:05:00,814
What does that mean?

113
00:05:00,881 --> 00:05:02,215
I don't know.

114
00:05:02,282 --> 00:05:04,084
It's what the guy
who cut my hair said.

115
00:05:04,151 --> 00:05:06,587
He also said
it was "fun and fabulous."

116
00:05:06,654 --> 00:05:07,788
Really?

117
00:05:07,855 --> 00:05:09,923
Yeah, and he invited Dad
to a party.

118
00:05:12,793 --> 00:05:14,562
I didn't go.

119
00:05:14,628 --> 00:05:16,263
It's just nice to be asked.

120
00:05:16,329 --> 00:05:20,868
So, why'd you decide to abandon
your classic cereal bowl coif?

121
00:05:20,934 --> 00:05:22,803
What's a "coif"?

122
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:24,605
You can't glean it
from the context?

123
00:05:24,672 --> 00:05:26,239
What's "glean"?

124
00:05:26,306 --> 00:05:28,676
Why'd you change
your freakin' hair?

125
00:05:28,742 --> 00:05:30,343
My new girlfriend
wanted me to.

126
00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:31,879
If your new girlfriend
wanted you

127
00:05:31,945 --> 00:05:33,581
to jump off a bridge,
would you do that?

128
00:05:33,647 --> 00:05:37,084
If she put her tongue in my
mouth when she asked me, yeah.

129
00:05:37,985 --> 00:05:39,386
Well, I can't blame you.

130
00:05:39,453 --> 00:05:41,589
I once bought a woman a car
for the same reason.

131
00:05:41,655 --> 00:05:43,223
She put her tongue
in your mouth?

132
00:05:44,592 --> 00:05:47,528
Sure, let's say mouth.

133
00:05:47,595 --> 00:05:50,097
Can we get
the check, please?

134
00:05:50,163 --> 00:05:52,533
Hey, why don't you let
me get this one?

135
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,902
Really? You're not going
to go for the world record?

136
00:05:54,968 --> 00:05:55,903
What are you talking about?

137
00:05:55,969 --> 00:05:58,906
1,647 meals in a row

138
00:05:58,972 --> 00:06:01,341
where you haven't taken out
your stupid Velcro wallet.

139
00:06:01,408 --> 00:06:02,710
You were counting?

140
00:06:02,776 --> 00:06:03,744
Am I close?

141
00:06:03,811 --> 00:06:07,715
Nevertheless, I'm paying.

142
00:06:07,781 --> 00:06:08,616
(sniffs)

143
00:06:08,682 --> 00:06:09,983
You smell that, Jake?

144
00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:11,919
The air coming out
of your father's wallet

145
00:06:11,985 --> 00:06:14,354
has been in there since
before you were born.

146
00:06:14,421 --> 00:06:15,723
Very funny.

147
00:06:15,789 --> 00:06:17,390
Thank you.

148
00:06:17,457 --> 00:06:18,692
Wait, wait, wait.

149
00:06:18,759 --> 00:06:20,661
Nobody is going to believe this.

150
00:06:20,728 --> 00:06:22,530
For God's sake.

151
00:06:29,102 --> 00:06:31,505
Hey, isn't that
Chelsea's friend, Gail?

152
00:06:32,606 --> 00:06:34,007
CHARLIE:
Oh, yeah.

153
00:06:34,074 --> 00:06:35,909
I wonder if I should
say hello.

154
00:06:35,976 --> 00:06:37,077
I wouldn't mind
saying hello.

155
00:06:37,144 --> 00:06:40,848
Finish paying the
check, you weasel.

156
00:06:40,914 --> 00:06:42,850
Hey, Dad, as long as you
got your wallet out,

157
00:06:42,916 --> 00:06:44,518
I could use
some new sneaks.

158
00:06:44,585 --> 00:06:45,786
Hmm. Oh...

159
00:06:45,853 --> 00:06:47,287
Sure.

160
00:06:48,388 --> 00:06:49,990
Are you dying?

161
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:53,827
Charlie.

162
00:06:53,894 --> 00:06:55,529
Oh, hi, Gail.

163
00:06:55,596 --> 00:06:57,865
Great to see you.

164
00:06:57,931 --> 00:06:59,032
How've you been?

165
00:06:59,099 --> 00:07:00,734
Pretty good. You?

166
00:07:00,801 --> 00:07:02,803
Well, you know...

167
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:05,438
Yeah, I'm sorry to hear
about you and Chelsea.

168
00:07:05,505 --> 00:07:06,540
The way it goes.

169
00:07:06,607 --> 00:07:08,041
Win some, lose some.

170
00:07:08,108 --> 00:07:10,110
Start having liquor delivered
straight to your house—

171
00:07:10,177 --> 00:07:11,845
you don't have
to put on pants.

172
00:07:11,912 --> 00:07:14,514
Well, if it's any consolation,
I know how you feel.

173
00:07:14,582 --> 00:07:16,884
I'm still not over
my breakup.

174
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:19,319
But I'm not much
of a drinker, so...

175
00:07:19,386 --> 00:07:20,921
Cheers.

176
00:07:20,988 --> 00:07:24,758
Have you, uh...
have you seen Chelsea?

177
00:07:24,825 --> 00:07:26,293
Yeah, actually I had
dinner with her, and...

178
00:07:27,327 --> 00:07:28,962
We had dinner

with his mother trying

358
00:15:29,076 --> 00:15:30,977
to help her download music
to her iPod.

359
00:15:31,044 --> 00:15:32,011
You're kidding!

360
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:33,813
And I just sat there thinking,

361
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:34,981
"Charlie would never do this.

362
00:15:35,048 --> 00:15:37,117
Charlie hates his mother
with a blind passion!"

363
00:15:37,184 --> 00:15:40,620
Remember when you used to think
that was a bad thing?

364
00:15:40,687 --> 00:15:43,123
And when Brad's not on the phone
with his mother,

365
00:15:43,190 --> 00:15:45,992
he's telling me how much
I remind him of his mother.

366
00:15:46,059 --> 00:15:47,960
I hope not while
you were in bed,

367
00:15:48,027 --> 00:15:50,663
'cause that would reflect badly
on everybody.

368
00:15:50,730 --> 00:15:52,199
You don't wanna know.

369
00:15:52,265 --> 00:15:53,766
There's nothing to know.

370
00:15:53,833 --> 00:15:55,402
You went to Mexico
with another man,

371
00:15:55,468 --> 00:15:56,869
he talked about his mother
in bed,

372
00:15:56,936 --> 00:15:58,438
and you didn't have sex
with him.

373
00:15:58,505 --> 00:15:59,906
Charlie...

374
00:15:59,972 --> 00:16:02,109
Nope! That's what happened.
End of story.

375
00:16:02,175 --> 00:16:03,410
(laughs)

376
00:16:03,476 --> 00:16:06,513
I should never have let you go.

377
00:16:06,579 --> 00:16:09,949
Well, sometimes you can't
appreciate what you've got

378
00:16:10,016 --> 00:16:13,786
until you go to Mexico and don't
have sex with a mama's boy.

379
00:16:13,853 --> 00:16:16,356
I'm sorry about Brad.

380
00:16:16,423 --> 00:16:18,024
I know that hurt you.

381
00:16:18,091 --> 00:16:20,026
Ah, it's water under the bridge.

382
00:16:20,093 --> 00:16:22,129
What you did, what I did,
doesn't matter.

383
00:16:22,195 --> 00:16:23,130
What did you do?

384
00:16:23,196 --> 00:16:24,931
Doesn't matter.

385
00:16:24,997 --> 00:16:27,100
Charlie, no secrets.

386
00:16:27,167 --> 00:16:28,935
Please, can't I just have one?

387
00:16:29,001 --> 00:16:30,770
Whatever it is,
it doesn't matter.

388
00:16:30,837 --> 00:16:32,172
We were separated.

389
00:16:34,307 --> 00:16:36,176
All right, here goes.

390
00:16:36,243 --> 00:16:39,045
I was having pizza with Alan
and Jake the other day.

391
00:16:39,112 --> 00:16:40,613
By the way,
Jake got a new haircut.

392
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:41,681
It's just fabulous.

393
00:16:43,283 --> 00:16:47,387
Okay, well, you'll never guess
who was there getting takeout.

394
00:16:48,688 --> 00:16:50,357
Your old buddy Gail.

395
00:16:50,423 --> 00:16:52,725
Oh, my God, you didn't.

396
00:16:52,792 --> 00:16:55,595
I didn't say I did,
but good guess.

397
00:16:55,662 --> 00:16:58,965
I don't believe you!

398
00:16:59,031 --> 00:17:00,700
What? We were separated.

399
00:17:00,767 --> 00:17:01,768
You were in Mexico
with another man.

400
00:17:01,834 --> 00:17:03,536
But she's my best friend!

401
00:17:03,603 --> 00:17:06,639
Yeah, well, I'd have to say
the jury's still out on that.

402

Go to hell!

405
00:17:12,845 --> 00:17:15,248
Oh, come on!

406
00:17:15,315 --> 00:17:16,816

I am a professional.

416
00:17:36,736 --> 00:17:38,305
I studied chiropractic

417
00:17:38,371 --> 00:17:40,039
for three years
in Guadalajara.

418
00:17:40,106 --> 00:17:42,842
And that was with almost no
Spanish language skills

419
00:17:42,909 --> 00:17:45,878
and a family of parasites
living in my colon.

420
00:17:45,945 --> 00:17:47,747
And I did not go through
all of that

421
00:17:47,814 --> 00:17:51,050
to become some sort
of G-spot Johnny.

422

Is that what you think you are?

423
00:17:53,186 --> 00:17:56,022
Well, you're giving me money,

Well, how about
we forget the money,

429
00:18:04,564 --> 00:18:07,400

I learned in Guadalajara?

430

Yeah, you kinda did.

You're both single,
you're both adults,

Plus you were honest with me, so
I'm willing to put it behind us.
