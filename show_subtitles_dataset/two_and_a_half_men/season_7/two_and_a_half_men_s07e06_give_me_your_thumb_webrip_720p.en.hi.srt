Yeah, just a little back pain.

00:00:38,061 --> 00:00:40,330
Oh, no. Uh, would you like me
to take a look?

This is what I do.

18
00:00:43,967 --> 00:00:45,302
Besides, you're like
family now,

19
00:00:45,368 --> 00:00:47,838
which entitles you to my family
and friends discount.

20
00:00:47,905 --> 00:00:49,106
All right.

21
00:00:49,172 --> 00:00:52,476
You'll actually be
the first one to use it.

22

Now, I trust your
insurance is up-to-date.

00:00:54,878 --> 00:00:57,214
Yeah, but I don't think
it covers chiropractic.

Oh, of course not.

25
00:00:58,415 --> 00:00:59,617
Big insurance will pay

26
00:00:59,683 --> 00:01:01,552
for an 80-year-old
man to get a boner,

27
00:01:01,619 --> 00:01:03,754
but God forbid his
spine is erect.

28
00:01:06,023 --> 00:01:07,858
Now, how long have you been
dealing with this pain?

29
00:01:07,925 --> 00:01:09,627
On and off since
I'm a teenager.

30
00:01:09,693 --> 00:01:12,896
Aha, so, would this be around
the time you started to develop?

31
00:01:12,963 --> 00:01:14,031
What do you mean?

32
00:01:14,097 --> 00:01:17,735
Well, you know,
as a woman.

00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:20,871
Oh, uh, yeah.

35
00:01:20,938 --> 00:01:23,106
Ah.

36
00:01:23,173 --> 00:01:24,675
I've always known
that's a factor,

37
00:01:24,742 --> 00:01:26,143
but what are you gonna do?

38
00:01:26,209 --> 00:01:29,012
Well, I would recommend that
you get two adjustments a week

39
00:01:29,079 --> 00:01:31,081
and ultrasound
massage therapy.

40
00:01:31,148 --> 00:01:33,250
Plus, we'll work on
strengthening your upper traps

41
00:01:33,316 --> 00:01:36,319
and rhomboids so they can
support the load on your pecs.

42
00:01:36,386 --> 00:01:38,689
Or, in layman's terms,

43
00:01:38,756 --> 00:01:41,158
reinforce the door
that holds up the knockers.

00:01:43,326 --> 00:01:44,762

It didn't help.

48
00:01:51,669 --> 00:01:55,138
Well, there is one other option,
but it's kind of a last resort.

It's a Web site about
breast reduction surgery.

69
00:02:55,365 --> 00:02:57,701
Oh, Alan,
you don't need surgery.

it could help.

I'll tell you what helps pain.

00:03:14,484 --> 00:03:15,653
Pain pills.

78
00:03:16,687 --> 00:03:17,688

79
00:03:17,755 --> 00:03:18,789
with a nail in his head,

80
00:03:18,856 --> 00:03:20,658
and thanks to pain pills,
he was laughing.

81
00:03:22,893 --> 00:03:24,461
What about addiction?

82
00:03:24,527 --> 00:03:26,563
That's the least
of his problems.

83
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:28,131

00:03:28,198 --> 00:03:30,668

00:03:30,734 --> 00:03:33,671

my unconditional support

87
00:03:35,839 --> 00:03:38,141
to do whatever you have to do
to feel better.

88
00:03:38,208 --> 00:03:40,310
Really?

89
00:03:40,377 --> 00:03:42,079
So you'd be okay with this?

90
00:03:42,145 --> 00:03:43,914
Sweetie, come on.

91
00:03:43,981 --> 00:03:45,482
I'm sure if you knew

92
00:03:45,548 --> 00:03:48,318
that the weight of my penis
was causing me back problems,

93
00:03:48,385 --> 00:03:52,055
you'd be okay with me
shaving off a few inches, right?

94
00:03:52,122 --> 00:03:54,291
I suppose.

95
00:03:54,357 --> 00:03:55,926

to deal with that pain,

106
00:04:24,554 --> 00:04:26,089
What are you doing
sticking your nose

107
00:04:26,156 --> 00:04:27,490
in my fiancée's breasts?

108
00:04:27,557 --> 00:04:28,992
I was just trying to help.

109
00:04:29,059 --> 00:04:31,194
Let's make one thing clear:
the only acceptable

110
00:04:31,261 --> 00:04:33,764
boob reduction in this house
is you moving out.

111
00:04:35,165 --> 00:04:37,567
Funny.
Please, Charlie...

112
00:04:37,634 --> 00:04:39,236
I make my living
with my hands.

113
00:04:39,302 --> 00:04:41,671

to masturbate?

124
00:05:05,228 --> 00:05:06,363
You've been very bad

125
00:05:06,429 --> 00:05:09,166
and you need to think
about what you've done.

126
00:05:09,232 --> 00:05:10,768
Okay, fine.
You want me to go to my room?

127
00:05:10,834 --> 00:05:12,102
Not far enough.
Movies?

128
00:05:12,169 --> 00:05:13,170
Not long enough.

129
00:05:13,236 --> 00:05:14,304
What do you want me to do?

130
00:05:14,371 --> 00:05:15,839

anything wrong.

358
00:15:40,363 --> 00:15:41,964
Oh, cool.

359
00:15:42,031 --> 00:15:43,600
So what's up?

360
00:15:43,666 --> 00:15:45,067
You want a quickie?

361
00:15:45,134 --> 00:15:46,836
No.

362
00:15:46,903 --> 00:15:49,138
I just got a call
from the plastic surgeon

363
00:15:49,205 --> 00:15:50,473
and they had a cancellation,

364
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:52,775
so they can squeeze me
in tomorrow morning.

365
00:15:52,842 --> 00:15:54,444
Tomorrow?

366
00:15:54,511 --> 00:15:56,679
But... that's so soon.

367
00:15:56,746 --> 00:15:58,114
Why put it off?

368
00:15:58,180 --> 00:16:00,383
Well, I was hoping
we'd have time

369
00:16:00,450 --> 00:16:02,419
to go away for a few days.

370
00:16:02,485 --> 00:16:04,987
You know, one last fling,

371
00:16:05,054 --> 00:16:07,289
just the four of us.

372
00:16:08,558 --> 00:16:09,892
You've flung them plenty,
Charlie.

373
00:16:09,959 --> 00:16:12,662
Oh, come on, just
give me some more time.

374
00:16:12,729 --> 00:16:15,097
Time for what?
Time to talk
you out of this.

375
00:16:15,164 --> 00:16:16,666
You said you were
going to support me.

376
00:16:16,733 --> 00:16:18,501
Yeah, but when do I get
my support?

377
00:16:18,568 --> 00:16:19,702
What are you talking about?

378
00:16:19,769 --> 00:16:21,504
This decision
affects both of us.

379
00:16:21,571 --> 00:16:22,905
I should get a vote.

380
00:16:22,972 --> 00:16:24,841
You're not the one in pain.

381
00:16:24,907 --> 00:16:27,910
(cries):
Then why does it hurt so much?

382
00:16:31,748 --> 00:16:33,883

Oh, and I thought,
tomorrow,

00:16:51,468 --> 00:16:53,636
I could take you
to my hair stylist.

389
00:16:53,703 --> 00:16:56,172
Get you one of those hip,
new spiky looks.

390
00:16:56,238 --> 00:16:57,907
Oh, that sounds like fun.

two haircuts away

Oh, nonsense.

394
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:05,548
You deserve to be
pampered a little bit.

395
00:17:05,615 --> 00:17:06,816
I kind of do, don't I?

396
00:17:06,883 --> 00:17:09,085
Yes, you do.

397
00:17:09,151 --> 00:17:12,455
I just have to be careful
not to make you too attractive.

398
00:17:12,522 --> 00:17:16,358

I don't want to lose
my fella to another gal.

00:17:18,194 --> 00:17:20,396
Your fella. Funny.

401
00:17:20,463 --> 00:17:22,131
Well, I'm serious.

402
00:17:22,198 --> 00:17:25,101
You'll always be my fella.

403
00:17:25,167 --> 00:17:29,138
And I'll always be
your best gal, right?

404
00:17:33,075 --> 00:17:34,376
Okay.

405
00:17:35,745 --> 00:17:39,582
And I've been thinking,
this is a big house.

406
00:17:39,649 --> 00:17:43,653
And you and I are clearly
not the marrying kind,

407
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:47,957
so... why don't you
just move in?

408
00:17:48,991 --> 00:17:50,259
Here?

409
00:17:50,326 --> 00:17:52,995
Sure. Why not?

410
00:17:53,062 --> 00:17:55,765
Can't you see how you and me

411
00:17:55,832 --> 00:17:57,466
are meant to be?

412
00:17:59,235 --> 00:18:02,739
Well, we're meant to be
mother and son.

413
00:18:02,805 --> 00:18:05,141
That's a given.

414
00:18:05,207 --> 00:18:07,243
It's how we're livin'.

415
00:18:08,310 --> 00:18:11,247
Very clever.

416
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:17,453
Of course,
there is a certain

417
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:19,689
financial imbalance.

418
00:18:19,756 --> 00:18:21,758
But I'm sure that we can

419
00:18:21,824 --> 00:18:23,893
come up with a plan that
meets both of our needs.

420
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:25,194
Plan? There's a,
there's a plan?

421
00:18:25,261 --> 00:18:28,297
Of course there's a plan.

422
00:18:29,866 --> 00:18:33,435
I mean, I'm a vibrant
woman now, Alan,

423
00:18:33,502 --> 00:18:35,938
but there will come
a time when I won't be able

424
00:18:36,005 --> 00:18:39,976
to fend for myself and I don't
want to pay some stranger

425
00:18:40,042 --> 00:18:43,746
to dress me and feed me
and carry me to the bath,

426
00:18:43,813 --> 00:18:45,782
soap up a wash cloth

427
00:18:45,848 --> 00:18:49,451
and give me a good,
thorough cleaning.

428
00:18:49,518 --> 00:18:51,954
Thanks, Mom! I'll call you.

429
00:18:54,090 --> 00:18:56,559
