If you buy a big bag
of irregular socks,

4

Charlie?

180
00:07:14,445 --> 00:07:16,314
What? Some kid out
of law school

181
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:18,382
hungry to make his bones.
What's wrong with that?

182
00:07:18,449 --> 00:07:21,585
He gets his hair cut by trainees
at the barber college.

183
00:07:22,986 --> 00:07:25,389
Alan, I'd be happy
to help you hire a lawyer.

184
00:07:25,456 --> 00:07:27,358
Oh, no, Chelsea,
I couldn't take money from you.

185
00:07:27,425 --> 00:07:29,192
That's an honor
he reserves for family.

186
00:07:30,494 --> 00:07:32,195
So, what, you guys really aren't
gonna help him?

187
00:07:32,262 --> 00:07:33,664
Well, of course we are.

188
00:07:33,731 --> 00:07:35,599
But if we didn't torture him
a little bit,

189
00:07:35,666 --> 00:07:37,635
he wouldn't feel comfortable
accepting our help.

190
00:07:37,701 --> 00:07:39,069
You don't know that. Try me!

191
00:07:40,438 --> 00:07:41,772
I'll tell you what.
I'll find the lawyer,

192
00:07:41,839 --> 00:07:43,341
and we'll split the fee.

193
00:07:43,407 --> 00:07:46,777
Not fifty-fifty, 'cause I'm out
six years of room,

194
00:07:46,844 --> 00:07:48,346
board and incidentals.

195
00:07:48,412 --> 00:07:52,282
And by incidentals, I mean
mostly Kleenex and hand lotion.

196
00:07:53,617 --> 00:07:54,718
Oh, please, I paid

197
00:07:54,785 --> 00:07:57,588
for four years of college
and chiropractor school,

198
00:07:57,655 --> 00:08:01,091
and he still gives me handmade
tchotchkes for Christmas.

199
00:08:01,158 --> 00:08:03,561
You said you loved
the pot holders I made you.

200
00:08:03,627 --> 00:08:05,596
I said they made me cry.

201
00:08:06,864 --> 00:08:09,132
Okay, okay, okay, fifty-fifty.

202
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:12,269
But we'll put it on my card
so I get the miles.

203
00:08:12,336 --> 00:08:14,372
I can't believe you two.

204
00:08:14,438 --> 00:08:17,675
That's okay, Chelsea, I'm used
to being treated this way.

205
00:08:17,741 --> 00:08:21,211
The mocking, the insults,
the humiliation.

206
00:08:21,278 --> 00:08:25,749
It's all part of the festering
ugliness of this family.

207
00:08:30,187 --> 00:08:32,523

Okay, bye-bye.

220
00:08:55,613 --> 00:08:57,581
Sorry. I just bought my mom
a new computer,

221
00:08:57,648 --> 00:08:59,483
and it's opened up
quite a can of worms.

222
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:02,953

No, no, no,
I'm his brother Charlie.

This is my fiancée Chelsea.

And this pasty-faced jughead
is the family Rottweiler.

00:09:18,235 --> 00:09:19,269
My fuse is long,

231
00:09:19,336 --> 00:09:22,940
but it is attached
to dynamite.

232
00:09:23,006 --> 00:09:24,708
Shut up.

233
00:09:24,775 --> 00:09:26,376
I'm payin' by the hour.

234
00:09:26,444 --> 00:09:27,845

just stop it.

235
00:09:27,911 --> 00:09:29,246
I'm sorry.

236
00:09:29,312 --> 00:09:31,048
That's all right.
I have siblings, too.

237
00:09:31,114 --> 00:09:33,551
We tease each other constantly.
You know, sometimes I think

it's just easier

Okay, well, I got some good news

240

Hey, when's the last time
you heard that?

241
00:09:45,028 --> 00:09:46,497
I made some calls,

242
00:09:46,564 --> 00:09:48,331
and the fella you punched has

243
00:09:48,398 --> 00:09:49,800
quite a few
alcohol-related priors,

244
00:09:49,867 --> 00:09:51,702
and is definitely not looking
to press charges.

245
00:09:51,769 --> 00:09:53,403
So I don't have
to go back to jail?

246
00:09:53,471 --> 00:09:54,938
You won't even see the inside
of a courtroom.

247
00:09:55,005 --> 00:09:56,173
Oh, thank God!

248
00:09:56,239 --> 00:09:59,543
I can't go back to
the joint again.

249
00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:02,045
All right, great,
we're off the clock.

251
00:10:03,514 --> 00:10:05,483
Eh, relax,
you don't owe me anything.

00:10:05,549 --> 00:10:07,551

00:10:13,156 --> 00:10:14,925
Well, uh,

00:10:14,992 --> 00:10:17,360
well, you can always make

Oh, that's wonderful.

264
00:10:30,641 --> 00:10:31,374
I love horses.

265
00:10:31,441 --> 00:10:32,375
I used to ride
all the time.

266
00:10:32,442 --> 00:10:34,077

267
00:10:34,144 --> 00:10:35,879
No, no, no, no, I got it.

You're very welcome.

281
00:11:04,441 --> 00:11:07,044

a nature ride and barbecue

282
00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:08,679
for the kids this Saturday.

283
00:11:08,746 --> 00:11:09,547

Doesn't it, Charlie?

286
00:11:12,983 --> 00:11:15,586
Do the kids race
the horses?

287
00:11:15,653 --> 00:11:16,754
What?

288
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:17,788
No.

289
00:11:17,855 --> 00:11:18,889
There's no action?

290
00:11:18,956 --> 00:11:20,490
No action.

291
00:11:20,558 --> 00:11:22,325

see the point.

They obviously mean
