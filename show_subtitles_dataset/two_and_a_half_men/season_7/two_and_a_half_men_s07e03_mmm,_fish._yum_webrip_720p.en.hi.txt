Just because they give
15-year-olds learner's permits,

7
00:00:14,565 --> 00:00:16,133
doesn't mean
they're ready to drive.

Just go to your room.

00:00:36,687 --> 00:00:39,156
Man, if I knew how to hot-wire
a real car,

20
00:00:39,223 --> 00:00:41,158

Beach for a weekend getaway.

Oh, how nice.
Taking the baby?

25
00:00:49,567 --> 00:00:51,402
Are you insane?
I said "getaway."

26
00:00:51,469 --> 00:00:52,736
Herb's lucky I'm taking him.

27
00:00:52,803 --> 00:00:54,238

little Millie?

29

My mother.

30
00:00:57,375 --> 00:00:59,343
Ooh. Are we sure
that's a good idea?

31
00:00:59,410 --> 00:01:01,679
Okay, first of all,
there is no "we" here.

32
00:01:01,745 --> 00:01:03,447
And what are you implying?

33
00:01:03,514 --> 00:01:06,149
I'm implying that there might be
better choices for a babysitter

34
00:01:06,216 --> 00:01:08,619
than a woman who has a sandwich
named after her

35
00:01:08,686 --> 00:01:10,421
at the Betty Ford Clinic.

36
00:01:11,555 --> 00:01:13,791
She's three years clean
and sober,

37
00:01:13,857 --> 00:01:16,560
all the charges were dropped
and she's great with Millie.

38
00:01:16,627 --> 00:01:17,828
All right. All right.

39
00:01:17,895 --> 00:01:18,896
I hope you don't mind,
but I gave her your number

in case there's an emergency.

41
00:01:20,030 --> 00:01:20,998
I don't mind.

42
00:01:21,064 --> 00:01:22,866
So, uh, how is the baby, anyway?

43
00:01:22,933 --> 00:01:24,535
Fine.

44
00:01:24,602 --> 00:01:25,936
Good, good.

45
00:01:26,003 --> 00:01:27,971
Jake showed me some pictures.

46
00:01:28,038 --> 00:01:29,973
I gotta say, she doesn't look
much like you,

47
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:32,209
and she certainly doesn't look
like Herb.

48
00:01:32,276 --> 00:01:34,211
Don't go there, Alan.

49
00:01:34,278 --> 00:01:35,846
Go where? I'm not implying

50
00:01:35,913 --> 00:01:38,081
that someone other than Herb
could be the father.

51
00:01:38,148 --> 00:01:41,118
Even though that someone did
have unprotected sex with you

52
00:01:41,184 --> 00:01:43,253
approximately nine months
before the birth of a child

53
00:01:43,321 --> 00:01:45,923
that looks suspiciously
like that someone.

54
00:01:47,090 --> 00:01:49,460
You get that I'm talking
about me, right?

55
00:01:49,527 --> 00:01:51,094
Honey, if we want
to beat the traffic,

56
00:01:51,161 --> 00:01:52,530
we really should get going.
Oh, hey, Alan.

57
00:01:52,596 --> 00:01:54,097
Hey, Herb.
Did you hear?

58
00:01:54,164 --> 00:01:56,967
Judith and I are spending a
romantic weekend in Laguna.

59
00:01:57,034 --> 00:01:58,969
I said "weekend," Herb.
That's all.

60
00:01:59,036 --> 00:02:01,171
Okay, fine,
no romance.

61
00:02:02,172 --> 00:02:04,408
But sex is still
on the table, right?

62
00:02:04,475 --> 00:02:05,809
Just get in the car.

00:02:05,876 --> 00:02:07,277

He knows you resent him
living here.

Yeah, away from you.

118

It's good that he's polite.

122
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:35,726
It's a necessary quality
in a doorman.

123
00:04:36,627 --> 00:04:38,729
Was that a "yes"
or a "no"?

124
00:04:38,796 --> 00:04:39,697
That was a "no."

125
00:04:39,763 --> 00:04:41,799
So the doorman thing
was an insult?

126
00:04:41,865 --> 00:04:43,066

All right, open the little panel

and enter pound,
star and the code.

143

the pain pills?

No.

00:05:34,117 --> 00:05:36,720
Good. See if she's
got any leftovers.

Okay, okay, okay,
