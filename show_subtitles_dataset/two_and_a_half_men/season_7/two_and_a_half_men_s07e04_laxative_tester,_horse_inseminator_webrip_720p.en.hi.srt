00:00:02,132 --> 00:00:04,502
ANNOUNCER:
Call now. Operators
are standing by.

2
00:00:04,535 --> 00:00:05,636
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.

3
00:00:05,669 --> 00:00:06,604
What are you doing?

4
00:00:06,637 --> 00:00:08,071
I'm calling them.

5
00:00:08,105 --> 00:00:10,474
Don't you want to be able
to scramble an egg

6
00:00:10,508 --> 00:00:12,209
while it's still
in the shell?

7
00:00:14,812 --> 00:00:16,580
Okay...

8
00:00:16,614 --> 00:00:19,683
new rule— you can't drink
while we watch cable television.

9
00:00:19,717 --> 00:00:21,719
You won't say that when you get

10
00:00:21,752 --> 00:00:24,488
a blanket with sleeves
for Christmas.

11
00:00:28,892 --> 00:00:30,694
Hi, Jake.

12
00:00:30,728 --> 00:00:32,563
Hmm.

13
00:00:32,596 --> 00:00:34,932
Can I offer you

14
00:00:34,965 --> 00:00:36,500
some fruit and cheese?

15
00:00:36,534 --> 00:00:38,035
You can, but I won't eat it.

16
00:00:38,068 --> 00:00:40,604
Okay.

17
00:00:40,638 --> 00:00:41,772
So what's new?

18
00:00:41,805 --> 00:00:43,206
How's your girlfriend?

19
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:45,543
That's kind of personal,
isn't it?

20
00:00:45,576 --> 00:00:48,078
Sorry. I'm just curious.

21
00:00:48,111 --> 00:00:50,147
Why, you writing a book?

22
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:55,853
Yeah, it's called The Day
Jake's Uncle Kicked His Ass.

23
00:00:55,886 --> 00:00:57,588
Whatever.

24
00:00:57,621 --> 00:00:59,189
Oh, no, don't go.

25
00:00:59,222 --> 00:01:00,891
We so enjoy your company.

26
00:01:02,893 --> 00:01:05,195
Did I do something wrong?

27
00:01:05,228 --> 00:01:07,865
Yeah, you
anthropomorphized him.

28
00:01:07,898 --> 00:01:09,667
What?

29
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:10,834
It means
treating something

30
00:01:10,868 --> 00:01:12,970
that's not human
as if it is.

31
00:01:13,003 --> 00:01:16,106
You know, like you
do with your cat.

32
00:01:16,139 --> 00:01:18,642
Which frankly,
makes more sense.

33
00:01:18,676 --> 00:01:20,611
I'm starting to think
Jake resents me.

34
00:01:20,644 --> 00:01:22,680
See? You're still doing it.

35
00:01:22,713 --> 00:01:24,815
Look, you can't
take it personal.

36
00:01:24,848 --> 00:01:26,249
He's a teenager.

37
00:01:26,283 --> 00:01:28,552
You know, that awkward stage
between junior high

38
00:01:28,586 --> 00:01:30,220
and methadone clinic.

39
00:01:30,253 --> 00:01:32,756
I just want to get
to know him better.

40
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:34,124
I already know him.

41
00:01:34,157 --> 00:01:35,559
Trust me, you're
not missing anything.

42
00:01:35,593 --> 00:01:37,928
Come on, there's got
to be something

43
00:01:37,961 --> 00:01:39,563
underneath that
sullen exterior.

44
00:01:39,597 --> 00:01:42,900
Yeah, a "D" student
with a perpetual boner.

45
00:01:45,268 --> 00:01:47,104
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.

46
00:01:47,137 --> 00:01:49,607

47
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:51,274
♪ Men.

48
00:01:53,677 --> 00:01:55,045
Kind of like
high school, huh?

49
00:01:55,078 --> 00:01:57,314
I never did this in high school.

50
00:01:57,347 --> 00:01:59,149
Really? Sex in a car?

51
00:01:59,182 --> 00:02:00,550
You're kind of
built for it.

52
00:02:03,386 --> 00:02:05,989
Oh, what the
heck is this?

53
00:02:06,023 --> 00:02:08,125
Oh, Jake's retainer.

54
00:02:08,158 --> 00:02:09,893
He lost this years ago.

55
00:02:09,927 --> 00:02:12,195
This cost me like, $500.

56
00:02:12,229 --> 00:02:14,364
Anyway...

57
00:02:14,397 --> 00:02:16,934
No, this is not
working for me.

58
00:02:16,967 --> 00:02:18,035
Want another
wine cooler?

59
00:02:18,068 --> 00:02:19,937
No, I want to be
in a real bed.

60
00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:21,204
Well, what do you
want me to do?

61
00:02:21,238 --> 00:02:22,205
You won't stay
at Charlie's.

62
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:24,107
How can I go back there

63
00:02:24,141 --> 00:02:25,609
after his fiancee
called me a tramp?

64
00:02:25,643 --> 00:02:26,810
Oh, come on, she
didn't mean it.

65
00:02:26,844 --> 00:02:28,311
That was just
heat of the moment

66
00:02:28,345 --> 00:02:29,847
when she found out
you'd slept with Charlie.

67
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:31,682
It doesn't bother you,
does it?

68
00:02:31,715 --> 00:02:33,617
Well, yeah, yeah,
a bit, you know,

69
00:02:33,651 --> 00:02:34,918
but beggars can't be choosers.

70
00:02:36,754 --> 00:02:38,656
And I love you.

71
00:02:40,658 --> 00:02:42,726
No, not here.

72
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:44,327
Well, then where?

73
00:02:44,361 --> 00:02:46,363
I'd be more than happy
to go back to your place

74
00:02:46,396 --> 00:02:48,632
if you could just get past
that little incident
with your mother.

75
00:02:48,666 --> 00:02:49,767
Little incident?

76
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,835
I caught you
in bed with her!

77
00:02:51,869 --> 00:02:55,038
Boy, you are just going
to keep harping on
that, aren't you?

78
00:02:55,072 --> 00:02:57,140
Why don't we just
got to a hotel?

79
00:02:57,174 --> 00:03:00,177
Uh, well, we could, but wouldn't
that feel kind of cheap?

80
00:03:00,210 --> 00:03:02,212
I'll tell you what
feels kind of cheap— you.

81
00:03:02,245 --> 00:03:03,280
What are you doing?

82
00:03:03,313 --> 00:03:04,915
I'm getting out of here.

83
00:03:04,948 --> 00:03:06,216
What-what, you're
gonna walk home?

84
00:03:06,249 --> 00:03:07,751
Well, it's not
far, Alan.

85
00:03:07,785 --> 00:03:09,653
You didn't want to waste
the gas, remember?

86
00:03:09,687 --> 00:03:12,222
Pardon me for being green.

87
00:03:12,255 --> 00:03:13,356
Good-bye.

88
00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:14,792
Oh, come on, Melissa!

89
00:03:14,825 --> 00:03:16,059
Let's not ruin
a beautiful evening!

90
00:03:16,093 --> 00:03:19,229
I already broke the seal
on the condom!

91
00:03:19,262 --> 00:03:21,732
All right, all right.

92
00:03:21,765 --> 00:03:23,433
All right, you win,
you win.

93
00:03:23,466 --> 00:03:25,068
I'll take you to a cheap motel.

This is not what it looks like.

What?

No.

120
00:04:47,117 --> 00:04:48,351
So what's with the attitude?

121
00:04:48,385 --> 00:04:50,253
What attitude?

122
00:04:50,287 --> 00:04:52,956
I just don't consider fruit and
cheese an acceptable snack.

That's not the point.

126
00:04:58,195 --> 00:05:01,031
Nachos— that's a proper
use of cheese.

127
00:05:01,064 --> 00:05:02,265
All right, all right,
listen to me.

128
00:05:02,299 --> 00:05:03,934
You're hurting Chelsea's
feelings

129
00:05:03,967 --> 00:05:06,436
and I need you to make an effort
to be nicer to her.

130
00:05:06,469 --> 00:05:08,071
Hey, it's not my problem

131
00:05:08,105 --> 00:05:09,372
if your girlfriend's
oversensitive.

132
00:05:09,406 --> 00:05:11,942
Yeah, it kind of is.

that's going to be?

Why? Just 'cause
you sleep with her?

Good for you. Why do people
think you're stupid?

'Cause of my grades.

00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,455
Actually, I'm an underachiever.

139
00:05:29,559 --> 00:05:31,194

00:05:31,228 --> 00:05:32,295

149
00:05:59,222 --> 00:06:00,490
She broke up with me

150
00:06:00,523 --> 00:06:03,426

as a sex offender.

00:06:06,964 --> 00:06:08,331
how difficult it is
to maintain a relationship

154

when you don't have
a place of your own?

Alan, if I didn't have
a place of my own,

156
00:06:13,436 --> 00:06:16,039
I'd be worried about more
important things than
a relationship.

157
00:06:16,073 --> 00:06:17,440
Like, you know,
getting a place of my own.

158
00:06:19,276 --> 00:06:21,845
So, you're saying I'm not
entitled to a relationship?

No, I'm saying if you
can't afford dog food

you don't get a dog.

supposed to be

alone for the rest of my life?

00:06:31,922 --> 00:06:34,925
No, you're supposed to get
your own freakin' place!

164
00:06:36,994 --> 00:06:40,898

doesn't mean it's gonna happen.
