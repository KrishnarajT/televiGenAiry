1
00:00:04,828 --> 00:00:08,632
So, do either of you guys
urinate with abnormal frequency?

2
00:00:10,801 --> 00:00:12,570
No.

3
00:00:14,772 --> 00:00:17,908
I mean,
you gotta define abnormal.

4
00:00:17,975 --> 00:00:19,042
And keep in
mind the body

5
00:00:19,109 --> 00:00:22,346
doesn't process
alcohol efficiently.

6
00:00:22,413 --> 00:00:24,147
Which is why your
Uncle Charlie

7
00:00:24,214 --> 00:00:26,149
is a perpetual
urine machine.

8
00:00:26,216 --> 00:00:28,185
Also keep in mind
that your father

9
00:00:28,252 --> 00:00:29,253
has the bladder control

10
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:31,922
of a frightened
nine-year-old girl.

11
00:00:33,156 --> 00:00:34,392
Which is why he needs to wear

12
00:00:34,458 --> 00:00:37,295
two pairs of undies
and a panty liner.

13
00:00:37,361 --> 00:00:39,497
Only on long drives.

14
00:00:39,563 --> 00:00:40,764
Oh, really?

15
00:00:40,831 --> 00:00:43,100
How many times a night
do you get up to pee?

16
00:00:43,166 --> 00:00:44,034
Just once.

17
00:00:44,101 --> 00:00:45,469
I can hear
your toilet flush, Alan.

18
00:00:45,536 --> 00:00:47,037
Okay, four times.

19
00:00:47,104 --> 00:00:49,540
But at least
I get out of bed to pee.

20
00:00:49,607 --> 00:00:50,574
Hey, hey.

21
00:00:50,641 --> 00:00:52,276
That was an isolated incident.

22
00:00:52,343 --> 00:00:55,145
I was dreaming my shoes
were on fire.

23
00:00:55,212 --> 00:00:57,080
Does that answer your
question, buddy?

24
00:00:57,147 --> 00:00:58,081
Yeah.

25
00:00:58,148 --> 00:01:01,084
And remind me
to never ask another one.

26
00:01:02,252 --> 00:01:04,355
Charlie?
Yeah?

27
00:01:04,422 --> 00:01:06,189
Why aren't you ready?

28
00:01:06,256 --> 00:01:07,391
Ready for...?

29
00:01:07,458 --> 00:01:08,959
You've got to be kidding me.

30
00:01:09,026 --> 00:01:10,928
I've told you
at least three times

31
00:01:10,994 --> 00:01:13,263
we're having dinner with
my girlfriend Gail tonight.

32
00:01:13,331 --> 00:01:14,765
Excuse me, gotta pee.

33
00:01:15,933 --> 00:01:17,301
I swear to God,
you never listen

34
00:01:17,368 --> 00:01:18,369
when I'm talking
to you.

35
00:01:18,436 --> 00:01:20,137
It's like you just tune me out.

36
00:01:20,203 --> 00:01:21,472
You look like
you're paying attention,

37
00:01:21,539 --> 00:01:23,273
but your mind
is a million miles away.

38
00:01:23,341 --> 00:01:24,842
CHARLIE:
Do I need to pee?

39
00:01:27,110 --> 00:01:28,211
Nah.

40
00:01:28,278 --> 00:01:29,246
I mean, I could.

41
00:01:29,313 --> 00:01:30,414
Might be traffic.

42
00:01:30,481 --> 00:01:31,315
Probably should pee.

43
00:01:31,382 --> 00:01:32,816
Yeah, better pee.

44
00:01:32,883 --> 00:01:34,618
Now we're going to be late,
and I'm going

45
00:01:34,685 --> 00:01:36,253
to be embarrassed
all because you don't listen.

46
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:39,089

so many nice things about you.

55
00:02:14,625 --> 00:02:16,627
Really? From who?

56
00:02:17,728 --> 00:02:18,896
Hello.

57
00:02:20,631 --> 00:02:21,899
Oh, right.

58
00:02:21,965 --> 00:02:23,233
Thanks.

59
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:26,003
I guess I only hear
the complaints.

60
00:02:26,069 --> 00:02:27,571
You don't hear anything.

61
00:02:27,638 --> 00:02:28,772
That's not true.

62
00:02:28,839 --> 00:02:30,508
You're right. It's not.

63
00:02:30,574 --> 00:02:32,009
He hears what
he wants to hear.

64
00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:35,012
So I'm right.

65
00:02:36,313 --> 00:02:39,149
Well, you still make
a great couple.
Thank you.

66
00:02:39,216 --> 00:02:42,119
And I'm really looking forward
to your wedding.

67
00:02:42,185 --> 00:02:44,888
(choking up): I'm sure it's
going to be beautiful.

68
00:02:46,123 --> 00:02:48,058
(whispering):
What'd I do?

69
00:02:48,125 --> 00:02:50,728
Nothing. I told you she's going
through a bad breakup.

70
00:02:50,794 --> 00:02:52,129
When did you tell me that?

71
00:02:52,195 --> 00:02:54,364
In the car,
on the way here.

72
00:02:54,432 --> 00:02:55,466
God.

73
00:02:57,435 --> 00:02:59,336
It's going to be okay.

74
00:02:59,403 --> 00:03:00,738
I know. It's just hard.

75
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:02,940
I thought I knew him.

76
00:03:03,006 --> 00:03:04,575
I thought we were going
to be together forever,

77
00:03:04,642 --> 00:03:06,510
like you and Charlie.
(sobs)

78
00:03:06,577 --> 00:03:10,347
CHARLIE:
Hard to believe somebody
got tired of doing her.

79
00:03:12,215 --> 00:03:15,318
Ooh, French fries look good.

80
00:03:15,385 --> 00:03:17,187
Why did I order
the baked potato?

81
00:03:18,422 --> 00:03:22,192
Isn't that right,
Charlie?
Absolutely.

82
00:03:22,259 --> 00:03:24,962
Now, is this the one
who's the old college roommate?

83
00:03:25,028 --> 00:03:27,164
I should really listen more.

84
00:03:27,230 --> 00:03:29,433
I mean, I knew he
was insensitive...

85
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:31,268
Boy, I bet,
if they were roommates,

86
00:03:31,334 --> 00:03:34,304
they did some experimenting.

87
00:03:34,371 --> 00:03:36,640
Why is it that girls
can experiment with other girls

88
00:03:36,707 --> 00:03:38,576
and not be gay, but if a guy

89
00:03:38,642 --> 00:03:41,178
so as much kisses another guy—
woop, bad memory.

90
00:03:41,244 --> 00:03:43,313
Drink... drink, drink, drink.

91
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:46,450
So you're just all alone
in that big apartment?

92
00:03:46,517 --> 00:03:48,519
He even took the dog.

93
00:03:48,586 --> 00:03:49,820
Bastard.

94
00:03:49,887 --> 00:03:51,955
What? It's my first drink.

95
00:03:52,022 --> 00:03:53,256
Not you.

96
00:03:53,323 --> 00:03:54,357
Brian took Rufus.

97
00:03:54,424 --> 00:03:55,593
Oh.

98
00:03:55,659 --> 00:03:57,327
Who's Rufus?

99
00:03:57,394 --> 00:03:59,997
For that matter, who's Brian?

100
00:04:00,063 --> 00:04:02,733
Life of Brian—
that was pretty funny.

101
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:05,168
Brian's Song, not so much.

102
00:04:05,235 --> 00:04:07,971
James Caan
was great in it, though.

103
00:04:08,038 --> 00:04:10,007
That's 'cause he's
a great actor.

104
00:04:10,073 --> 00:04:12,142
The Godfather, Rollerball...

105
00:04:12,209 --> 00:04:17,180
Yeah, I can so see these two
kissing in a dorm room.

106
00:04:17,247 --> 00:04:19,316
That's really sweet,
but I couldn't impose.

107
00:04:19,382 --> 00:04:20,250
We insist.

108
00:04:20,317 --> 00:04:21,619
Right, Charlie?
Absolutely.

109
00:04:21,685 --> 00:04:23,787
CHELSEA:
There.

110
00:04:23,854 --> 00:04:26,323
You'll come stay with us
for a few days and heal.

111
00:04:26,389 --> 00:04:27,891
I don't know what to say.

112
00:04:27,958 --> 00:04:28,892
Say yes.

113
00:04:28,959 --> 00:04:30,961
Um... yes.

114
00:04:31,028 --> 00:04:32,496
Good.

115
00:04:32,563 --> 00:04:33,797
After dinner, we can
go back to her apartment

116
00:04:33,864 --> 00:04:35,733
so she can pack a bag.
Absolutely.

117
00:04:35,799 --> 00:04:38,035
You'll love
Charlie's place.

118
00:04:38,101 --> 00:04:39,036
It's right on the sand.

119
00:04:39,102 --> 00:04:41,038

came to stay with us
for a few days.

124

and have Jake sleep

162
00:06:20,570 --> 00:06:21,905
Fair question.
Why don't you trim

00:07:15,659 --> 00:07:18,428
Okay, I put fresh sheets
on the bed.

182
00:07:18,495 --> 00:07:19,396
Alan, this is my
friend Gail.

183
00:07:19,462 --> 00:07:20,664
Gail, this is Alan.

184
00:07:20,731 --> 00:07:23,266
I'm so sorry
to put you out like this,

185
00:07:23,333 --> 00:07:24,334
(fading out):
but your brother said...

186
00:07:24,401 --> 00:07:27,337
ALAN:
Gorp. Fnark. Schmegle.

187
00:07:28,872 --> 00:07:31,909
Oh, God, I've been waiting
for you all my life.

188
00:07:31,975 --> 00:07:33,410
(no audio)

189
00:07:33,476 --> 00:07:35,078
Marry me. Have my children.

190
00:07:35,145 --> 00:07:36,579
(no audio)

191
00:07:36,646 --> 00:07:39,082
It's really very generous
of you.

192
00:07:39,149 --> 00:07:40,517
Gorp.

193
00:07:40,583 --> 00:07:41,785
Fnark.

194
00:07:41,852 --> 00:07:44,354
Schmegle.

195
00:07:44,421 --> 00:07:46,757
Come on,
I'll show you the room.

196
00:07:52,462 --> 00:07:55,598
(humming "Here Comes the Bride"
in head)

197
00:07:58,435 --> 00:08:01,171
(humming funky guitar line
in head)

198
00:08:15,285 --> 00:08:17,520
Chelsea?

199
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:31,634
Chelsea?

200
00:08:33,236 --> 00:08:35,638
(woman crying)

201
00:08:40,744 --> 00:08:42,645
(crying continues)

202
00:08:46,917 --> 00:08:48,919
Chels, you in there?

203
00:08:48,986 --> 00:08:50,153
CHELSEA:
It's okay, Charlie.

204
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:51,621
Come on in.

205
00:08:52,722 --> 00:08:54,657
(crying)

206
00:08:59,096 --> 00:09:00,597
Everything all right?

207
00:09:00,663 --> 00:09:01,965
She's pretty upset.

208
00:09:02,032 --> 00:09:05,068
I'm sorry I'm such
a basket case.

209
00:09:05,135 --> 00:09:06,103
Oh, please.

210
00:09:06,169 --> 00:09:08,738
We're here for you, baby.

211
00:09:08,806 --> 00:09:10,207
Right, Charlie?

212
00:09:10,273 --> 00:09:12,342
Absolutely.

213
00:09:14,845 --> 00:09:17,781
I guess I'll... leave
you two alone.

214
00:09:17,848 --> 00:09:19,983
You don't have to go.

215
00:09:23,921 --> 00:09:24,955
I don't?

216
00:09:25,755 --> 00:09:28,125
Not unless you want to.

217
00:09:29,226 --> 00:09:30,427
CHARLIE:
Gorp.

218
00:09:30,493 --> 00:09:32,162
Fnark. Schmegle.

219
00:09:33,263 --> 00:09:34,431
Come on, Charlie.

220
00:09:34,497 --> 00:09:36,599
We all know what
you really want to do.

221
00:09:36,666 --> 00:09:38,802
We do?

222
00:09:38,869 --> 00:09:40,838
We do.

223
00:09:42,139 --> 00:09:43,807
Come here. Join us.

224
00:09:47,978 --> 00:09:50,647
Uh, okay.

225
00:09:58,355 --> 00:10:01,724
So... what now?

226
00:10:02,625 --> 00:10:04,127
Do I really need
to tell you?

227
00:10:04,194 --> 00:10:07,865
We'd probably be better off
if you did.

228
00:10:08,765 --> 00:10:10,767
Okay.

229
00:10:10,834 --> 00:10:13,871
I want you
to make Gail happy.

230
00:10:18,008 --> 00:10:19,509
And you're on board?

231
00:10:19,576 --> 00:10:21,544
It was my idea.

232
00:10:21,611 --> 00:10:24,747
Don't worry— she and I
have done this before.

233
00:10:24,814 --> 00:10:26,116
In college.

234
00:10:26,183 --> 00:10:28,318
I knew it.

235
00:10:32,489 --> 00:10:36,659
Okay, let's turn that frown
upside down.

236
00:10:38,528 --> 00:10:41,164
That's a good boy.

237
00:10:41,231 --> 00:10:43,300
Hey, Chels?
Yeah, babe?

238
00:10:43,366 --> 00:10:45,302
This is a dream, right?

239
00:10:45,368 --> 00:10:47,070
Of course it's a dream.

240
00:10:47,137 --> 00:10:49,672
You think I'm really gonna let
you sleep with my best friend?

241
00:10:50,573 --> 00:10:53,476
Well, in that case, hang on.

242
00:10:53,543 --> 00:10:57,347
'Cause I'm gonna do some
real freaky stuff here.

243
00:11:04,754 --> 00:11:05,688
♪ Men. ♪

244
00:11:14,497 --> 00:11:16,599
Yowza.

245
00:11:16,666 --> 00:11:18,902
Excuse me.

246
00:11:18,969 --> 00:11:20,938
I brought you some
fresh towels, Gail.

247
00:11:21,004 --> 00:11:23,273
Oh, aren't you sweet.

248
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:25,075
Sure, sweet.

249
00:11:25,142 --> 00:11:27,377
Go smell his room.

250
00:11:29,446 --> 00:11:30,447
Morning.

251
00:11:30,513 --> 00:11:32,115
Good, you're up.

252
00:11:32,182 --> 00:11:33,583
I made you some toast.

253
00:11:33,650 --> 00:11:34,784
Here's your orange
juice.

254
00:11:34,851 --> 00:11:35,752
Oh, thank you, honey.

255
00:11:35,818 --> 00:11:37,187
I'll see you later.

256
00:11:37,254 --> 00:11:39,822
Wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, you're leaving?

257
00:11:39,889 --> 00:11:41,524
I told you I have to go
in to work today.

258
00:11:41,591 --> 00:11:43,560
But what about Gail?

259
00:11:43,626 --> 00:11:44,995
She can take care of herself.

260
00:11:45,062 --> 00:11:47,197
I think she's already
made a new friend.

261
00:11:47,264 --> 00:11:48,798
Yeah, I saw.

262
00:11:48,865 --> 00:11:51,001
You don't think he's got a shot,
do you?

263
00:11:51,068 --> 00:11:52,602
Charlie, you're horrible.

264
00:11:52,669 --> 00:11:53,903
I was joking.

265
00:11:53,971 --> 00:11:55,272
So how long are you
going to be gone?

266
00:11:55,338 --> 00:11:56,739
I'll be home for dinner—
I thought maybe

267
00:11:56,806 --> 00:11:58,175
I'd pick up
some Chinese food,

268
00:11:58,241 --> 00:12:00,177
and we could stay in
and...
Is she nuts?

269
00:12:00,243 --> 00:12:02,779
I can't be trusted alone
with that chick.

270
00:12:02,845 --> 00:12:05,983
Wait, maybe this is a test.

271
00:12:06,049 --> 00:12:06,950
A trap.

272
00:12:07,017 --> 00:12:08,151
The two of them are in cahoots

273
00:12:08,218 --> 00:12:10,553
to find out
if I'll make a move.

274
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:13,590
Cahoots, that's a funny word.

275
00:12:13,656 --> 00:12:16,393
Sounds like an owl sneezing.

276
00:12:16,459 --> 00:12:19,229
Ca-ca-ca-cahoots!

277
00:12:19,296 --> 00:12:20,863
So, I'll call you later.

278
00:12:20,930 --> 00:12:22,432
Absolutely.

279
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:25,402
Morning, Alan.

280
00:12:25,468 --> 00:12:27,337
Oh, uh, morning.

281
00:12:27,404 --> 00:12:29,172
Thank you again for letting
Gail have your room.

282
00:12:29,239 --> 00:12:30,640
Oh, don't be silly.
Happy to do it.

283
00:12:30,707 --> 00:12:32,142
Uh, mi casa, her casa.

284
00:12:32,209 --> 00:12:33,776
It's actually his casa,

285
00:12:33,843 --> 00:12:37,014
but the dehumidifier and
the night-light belong to me.

286
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,315
Still very nice of you.

287
00:12:38,381 --> 00:12:39,316
See ya later.

288
00:12:41,651 --> 00:12:43,220
What you got going on today?

289
00:12:43,286 --> 00:12:45,922
Going to play a little tennis
in 1958?

290
00:12:45,989 --> 00:12:47,924
This old thing?

291
00:12:47,991 --> 00:12:50,127
This is just my
knock-around clothes.

292
00:12:50,193 --> 00:12:52,295
So, what's the story on Gail?

293
00:12:52,362 --> 00:12:53,363
Bad breakup?

294
00:12:53,430 --> 00:12:54,364
Something like that.

295
00:12:54,431 --> 00:12:55,498
So, she's on the rebound.

296
00:12:55,565 --> 00:12:56,966
Where you going with this, Alan?

297
00:12:57,034 --> 00:12:58,935
Oh, nowhere,
I'm just curious about her.

298
00:12:59,002 --> 00:13:00,803
And, you know,
when we met last night,

299
00:13:00,870 --> 00:13:02,372
I-I sensed a little spark
between us.

300
00:13:02,439 --> 00:13:03,906
If there was a spark,

301
00:13:03,973 --> 00:13:06,909
it's only 'cause she was
warming up her Taser.

302
00:13:06,976 --> 00:13:09,179
Ha-ha, very funny.

303
00:13:09,246 --> 00:13:11,181
Alan, trust me, the only way
you're gonna

304
00:13:11,248 --> 00:13:13,550
hook up with someone like Gail
is in your dreams.

305
00:13:13,616 --> 00:13:14,817
Already did.

306
00:13:15,785 --> 00:13:17,054
Really? Was Chelsea there?

307
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:19,622
No! Good Lord!
How creepy would that be?

308
00:13:22,859 --> 00:13:24,594
Well, regardless,
forget about Gail.

309
00:13:24,661 --> 00:13:28,265
Potato head out there has
a better shot than you do.

310
00:13:28,331 --> 00:13:30,100
You know, I've got a nephew
about your age.

311
00:13:30,167 --> 00:13:31,834
You should meet him.
He plays guitar, too.

312
00:13:31,901 --> 00:13:33,002
Maybe you guys
could jam sometime.

313
00:13:33,070 --> 00:13:35,938
Oh... boobies.

314
00:13:36,005 --> 00:13:38,175
(no audio)

315
00:13:39,809 --> 00:13:41,811
Hey, for your information,

316
00:13:41,878 --> 00:13:44,081
there is a very good chance
that a woman like that

317
00:13:44,147 --> 00:13:45,682
is tired of rich, handsome,
successful guys

318
00:13:45,748 --> 00:13:47,717
who have their own homes
and recently built cars.

319
00:13:47,784 --> 00:13:49,152
You really believe that?

320
00:13:49,219 --> 00:13:51,854
I have to.

321
00:13:51,921 --> 00:13:52,955
Woof!

322
00:13:53,022 --> 00:13:54,391
Who's that?

323
00:13:54,457 --> 00:13:55,758
Chelsea's friend.

324
00:13:55,825 --> 00:13:57,260
She's going through
a bad breakup

325
00:13:57,327 --> 00:13:58,895
so she's going to stay here
for a few days...

326
00:13:58,961 --> 00:14:01,864
Hmph! Too bad
I prefer the fellas.

327
00:14:03,933 --> 00:14:06,869
Then again, I can always
draw a moustache on her.

328
00:14:09,472 --> 00:14:11,908
♪ Men. ♪

329
00:14:14,511 --> 00:14:16,646

is another dream.

337
00:14:44,407 --> 00:14:46,376

Good. Good.

340
00:14:49,512 --> 00:14:50,513
I'm going to run some errands.

341
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:52,349
Can I get you anything
while I'm out?

342
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:54,584
A reason to live.

343
00:14:57,187 --> 00:14:59,122
All righty.

345
00:15:05,162 --> 00:15:07,130

347
00:15:09,632 --> 00:15:11,368
Sorry.

348
00:15:11,434 --> 00:15:13,370
I just got some bad news.

349
00:15:13,436 --> 00:15:15,037
What happened?

350
00:15:15,104 --> 00:15:16,606
My boyfriend...

351
00:15:16,673 --> 00:15:17,940
Rufus?

352
00:15:18,007 --> 00:15:20,109
That's my dog.

353
00:15:20,177 --> 00:15:21,678
Oh, yeah.

354
00:15:21,744 --> 00:15:22,712
He's okay, right?

355
00:15:22,779 --> 00:15:24,547
He's fine.

356
00:15:24,614 --> 00:15:27,750
I just found out Brian is
already seeing someone else.

357
00:15:27,817 --> 00:15:29,486
No.

358
00:15:29,552 --> 00:15:31,053
I mean, we just broke up

359
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:33,523
and he's already sleeping
with another woman?

360
00:15:33,590 --> 00:15:35,558
The pig!

361
00:15:35,625 --> 00:15:38,361
I thought we had something.

362
00:15:38,428 --> 00:15:39,429

363
00:15:39,496 --> 00:15:41,298
He always said
I was his soul mate

364
00:15:41,364 --> 00:15:42,999
and that he wanted
to spend the rest

365
00:15:43,065 --> 00:15:43,833
of his life
with me...

366
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:45,635
This can't be a dream.

367
00:15:45,702 --> 00:15:48,438
She's still got her clothes on.

368
00:15:48,505 --> 00:15:51,574
And she's talking.

369
00:15:51,641 --> 00:15:54,277
Why can't I find a
nice guy like you?

370
00:15:54,344 --> 00:15:57,214
Absolutely.

371
00:15:57,280 --> 00:16:00,617
Maybe Chelsea would
let me borrow you.

372
00:16:00,683 --> 00:16:03,286
(wry chuckle)

373
00:16:06,022 --> 00:16:08,124
Excuse me, gotta pee.

374
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:13,129
Oh, crap, crap, crap, crap,
crap, crap, crap, crap.

375
00:16:13,196 --> 00:16:14,864
Here you go.
Thanks.

376
00:16:14,931 --> 00:16:17,066
I don't know how much longer
I can hold out.

377
00:16:17,133 --> 00:16:20,203
I hear you.

378
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:21,971
What?

379
00:16:22,038 --> 00:16:23,673
Nothing.

380
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:25,041
I gotta get Gail out of here

381
00:16:25,107 --> 00:16:27,544
before I do something
I'm going to regret.

382
00:16:27,610 --> 00:16:29,746
You know, after
I thoroughly enjoy it.

383
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:33,182
Just tell her to leave.

384
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:34,317
I can't do that.

385
00:16:34,384 --> 00:16:36,118
She's Chelsea's best friend.

386
00:16:36,185 --> 00:16:37,620
They were college roommates.

387
00:16:37,687 --> 00:16:38,655
Really?

388
00:16:40,223 --> 00:16:41,924
You think they experimented?

389
00:16:41,991 --> 00:16:43,460
Oh, yeah.

390
00:16:44,527 --> 00:16:46,463
(both chuckle)

391
00:16:49,866 --> 00:16:53,270
I gotta figure out a way to get
Gail to leave on her own.

392
00:16:53,336 --> 00:16:55,338
You got the perfect tool
for the job.

393
00:16:55,405 --> 00:16:57,073
What are you talking about?

394
00:16:57,139 --> 00:16:59,075
The one tool that's guaranteed

395
00:16:59,141 --> 00:17:00,810
to drive any woman
out of your house.

396
00:17:00,877 --> 00:17:03,012
Hello.

397
00:17:04,281 --> 00:17:07,284
Oh, look,
it's an Allen wrench.

398
00:17:10,887 --> 00:17:12,522
What was that about?

399
00:17:12,589 --> 00:17:13,923
Nothing. Nothing.

400
00:17:13,990 --> 00:17:16,092
I was just telling Berta
that maybe I was wrong

401
00:17:16,158 --> 00:17:17,960
about you not having
a shot with Gail.

402
00:17:18,027 --> 00:17:18,995
Why?
Did she say something?

403
00:17:19,061 --> 00:17:20,397
Did she ask about me?

404
00:17:20,463 --> 00:17:22,031
How would you feel
about a double wedding?

405
00:17:22,098 --> 00:17:23,900
I mean, as long
as you're paying for one.

406
00:17:23,966 --> 00:17:25,902
Slow down, slow down.

407
00:17:25,968 --> 00:17:27,904
Nobody said anything.

408
00:17:27,970 --> 00:17:30,373
I just realized
I might've been jealous

409
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:32,809
'cause she's so beautiful
and if I can't have her,

410
00:17:32,875 --> 00:17:34,444
I didn't want you
to have her either.

411
00:17:34,511 --> 00:17:37,314
Yeah, I was thinking
it might be that.

412
00:17:38,281 --> 00:17:40,216
Anyway, it's not fair for me

413
00:17:40,283 --> 00:17:41,751
to stand in the way
of your happiness.

414
00:17:41,818 --> 00:17:43,252
Really?

415
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:44,787
I always thought that was one
of your favorite things.

416
00:17:44,854 --> 00:17:46,188
Do you want to pick nits

417
00:17:46,255 --> 00:17:47,357
or do you want to go talk
to a beautiful woman

418
00:17:47,424 --> 00:17:48,725
who's extremely vulnerable

419
00:17:48,791 --> 00:17:50,427
and may very well be looking
for revenge sex?

420
00:17:50,493 --> 00:17:52,028
I don't want revenge sex,

421
00:17:52,094 --> 00:17:54,797
I want a loving relationship
that has depth and meaning

422
00:17:54,864 --> 00:17:57,099
and that will withstand
the test of time.

423
00:17:57,166 --> 00:17:58,134
Oh, that's good.

424
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:59,469
I'd lead with that.

425
00:17:59,536 --> 00:18:00,537
You think?

426
00:18:00,603 --> 00:18:02,472
Oh, yeah, go get her.

427
00:18:02,539 --> 00:18:03,740
All right.

428
00:18:03,806 --> 00:18:04,707
All right. Wish me luck.

429
00:18:04,774 --> 00:18:06,443
You don't need luck.

430
00:18:06,509 --> 00:18:08,678
You've got the exact skills
needed to get this job done.

431
00:18:08,745 --> 00:18:09,679
Thanks, Charlie.

432
00:18:09,746 --> 00:18:13,249
You're a good brother.

433
00:18:13,316 --> 00:18:17,286
If he actually gets laid,
I'm going to hang myself.

434
00:18:19,288 --> 00:18:21,724
(knocking on door)
Come in.

435
00:18:21,791 --> 00:18:22,559
Hey, there.

436
00:18:22,625 --> 00:18:23,793
Hi, Alan.

437
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:26,262
You, uh, up
for a little company?

438
00:18:26,329 --> 00:18:28,064
I guess.

439
00:18:29,966 --> 00:18:32,769
You know, it does
get easier.

440
00:18:32,835 --> 00:18:34,804
The wound does heal.

441
00:18:34,871 --> 00:18:36,773
I know. Thank you.

442
00:18:36,839 --> 00:18:38,508
I mean, it may not
feel like it now,

443
00:18:38,575 --> 00:18:41,578
but before too long, you'll
forget all about that fella

444
00:18:41,644 --> 00:18:44,814
who hurt you, because another
fella will be in your heart.

445
00:18:44,881 --> 00:18:48,084
A fella who'll
never hurt you.

446
00:18:49,619 --> 00:18:52,188
Who'll never leave
your side.

447
00:18:52,254 --> 00:18:54,991
A fella who wants
nothing more

448
00:18:55,057 --> 00:18:57,059
than to love you...

449
00:18:57,126 --> 00:19:00,229
GAIL:
Oh, dear God, no.

450
00:19:02,098 --> 00:19:03,833
Thanks for
your hospitality, Charlie,

451
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:05,167
but I should get back home.

452
00:19:05,234 --> 00:19:07,036
Anytime.
So where'd we leave it?

453
00:19:07,103 --> 00:19:08,438
Uh, I'll call you,
you'll call me?

454
00:19:08,505 --> 00:19:10,106
I'll call you.

455
00:19:12,409 --> 00:19:14,377
So...

456
00:19:14,444 --> 00:19:17,547
how'd it go?

457
00:19:17,614 --> 00:19:19,348
You heard her.

458
00:19:19,416 --> 00:19:21,217
She's gonna call me.

459
00:19:25,121 --> 00:19:27,824
♪ Men. ♪

460
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:32,595
You knew very well that
Gail was going through
a difficult time.

461
00:19:32,662 --> 00:19:33,496
So what do you do?

462
00:19:33,563 --> 00:19:34,664
You try to take
advantage,

463
00:19:34,731 --> 00:19:36,466
to-to exploit her
vulnerability...

464
00:19:36,533 --> 00:19:40,069
What is it about an angry woman
that I find so hot?

465
00:19:40,136 --> 00:19:41,604
(no audio)

466
00:19:41,671 --> 00:19:43,406
Even when that fat cashier
at the supermarket

467
00:19:43,473 --> 00:19:46,008
was yelling at me,
I got a little engorged.

468
00:19:46,075 --> 00:19:47,577
(no audio)

469
00:19:47,644 --> 00:19:50,813
Boy, if I could just find
somebody like Chelsea.

470
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:53,850
I mean, look at her go.

471
00:19:53,916 --> 00:19:56,986
She's a real fireball.

472
00:19:57,053 --> 00:19:58,755
Speaking of fireballs,

473
00:19:58,821 --> 00:20:01,491
next time I manscape I should
probably skip the aftershave.
