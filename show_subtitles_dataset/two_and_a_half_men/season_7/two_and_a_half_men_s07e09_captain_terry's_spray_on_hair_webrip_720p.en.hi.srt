00:00:11,405 --> 00:00:15,443
Wow. That was great.

5
00:00:15,509 --> 00:00:17,010
Good, I'm glad.

6
00:00:18,045 --> 00:00:21,382
Wait, wait, wait.
You're glad?

7
00:00:21,449 --> 00:00:23,484
Yeah.

8
00:00:23,551 --> 00:00:25,786
I knew it.

9
00:00:25,853 --> 00:00:27,588
There was no "gaa."

10
00:00:27,655 --> 00:00:28,689
"Gaa"?

11
00:00:28,756 --> 00:00:30,891
When the sex is
working for you,

12
00:00:30,958 --> 00:00:34,628
you try to say "God,"
but it comes out "gaa."

13
00:00:34,695 --> 00:00:37,298
And this time,
there was no "gaa."

14
00:00:37,365 --> 00:00:38,466

15
00:00:38,532 --> 00:00:42,470
No "gaa," no good.

And I'll tell you
another thing.

17
00:00:44,037 --> 00:00:45,673
You usually grab my ass
like you're holding

18
00:00:45,739 --> 00:00:48,576
a tree trunk in
a hurricane.

19
00:00:48,642 --> 00:00:50,178
Just now, it was more
like you were palming

20
00:00:50,244 --> 00:00:52,880
a couple of cantaloupes
at the supermarket.

21
00:00:52,946 --> 00:00:55,115
Fireworks don't have
to go off every time

22
00:00:55,183 --> 00:00:56,784
for me to enjoy it.

23
00:00:56,850 --> 00:01:00,988
Oh, please, fireworks is the
whole point of the exercise.

24
00:01:01,054 --> 00:01:02,523
Otherwise, all you've got is

25
00:01:02,590 --> 00:01:05,359
two naked people humping
on a StairMaster.

26
00:01:05,426 --> 00:01:08,429
Sometimes it's nice
just being close.

27
00:01:08,496 --> 00:01:10,398
Nice being close.

28
00:01:10,464 --> 00:01:11,599
Great.

29
00:01:11,665 --> 00:01:15,203

like to be my brother.

30
00:01:15,269 --> 00:01:16,470
Would you stop it?

31
00:01:16,537 --> 00:01:18,872
No, this is the
beginning of the end.

32
00:01:18,939 --> 00:01:20,874
First our sex life
goes to hell,

33
00:01:20,941 --> 00:01:23,177
then we start eating
dinner at 4:30,

34
00:01:23,244 --> 00:01:26,914
watching reruns of
Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman,

35
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:30,284
and at 9:00 we shake hands,
pee and go to sleep.

36
00:01:30,351 --> 00:01:33,721
Then around midnight
I get up to pee again.

37
00:01:33,787 --> 00:01:35,889
Quit making such
a big deal out of it.

38
00:01:35,956 --> 00:01:36,724
Just because every once
in a while

39
00:01:36,790 --> 00:01:38,025
I don't have an orgasm...

40
00:01:38,091 --> 00:01:40,294
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

41
00:01:40,361 --> 00:01:41,929
This has happened before?

42
00:01:41,995 --> 00:01:43,130
Just a few times.

43
00:01:43,197 --> 00:01:45,333
Why didn't I know?
Were you faking it?

44
00:01:45,399 --> 00:01:46,434
Does it matter?

45
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:47,901
You're damn right, it matters.

46
00:01:47,968 --> 00:01:50,070
Why'd you stop?
Don't you love me anymore?

47
00:01:50,137 --> 00:01:52,340
Of course I love you.

48
00:01:52,406 --> 00:01:54,575
If you really loved me,
you'd keep faking it.

49
00:01:54,642 --> 00:01:56,944
Fine, from now on
I'll fake it.

50
00:01:57,010 --> 00:02:00,281
Too late.
Now I'm on to you.

51
00:02:01,982 --> 00:02:04,084
Honey, there's nothing
to get so upset about.

52
00:02:04,151 --> 00:02:07,521
I've just been working really
hard, under a lot of stress.

53
00:02:07,588 --> 00:02:10,157
Then on top of that,
I'm trying to plan our wedding

54
00:02:10,224 --> 00:02:12,993
and dealing with my parents,
your mother.

55
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:15,763
But trust me,
as far as I'm concerned,

There are two things you never
want to buy on the cheap:

to condoms?

It's time to break

00:15:13,006 --> 00:15:15,442
Okay, okay, first of all,
I'm pretty sure

352
00:15:15,508 --> 00:15:17,477
that our people
are Scotch-Irish.

353
00:15:17,544 --> 00:15:20,380
Perhaps. But the
Talmud teaches us

00:15:20,447 --> 00:15:23,216

00:15:27,387 --> 00:15:29,656
Figured I might need a
little Jewish dinner chat.

358
00:15:29,722 --> 00:15:31,024
Lucky I did some research—

359
00:15:31,091 --> 00:15:34,161
I was planning on taking
this girl to Red Lobster.

361
00:15:37,164 --> 00:15:38,998
Oh! Uh, I got to go.

Oh, uh, listen, Jake's
grounded for coming

on the little pisher, would you?

Okay.

Let's go again.

373
00:16:11,764 --> 00:16:13,800
You do realize that
at a certain point

374
00:16:13,866 --> 00:16:15,568
we're going to have
to go to bed.

375
00:16:15,635 --> 00:16:16,503
I know. I know.
It's not like

376
00:16:16,569 --> 00:16:19,139
I'm avoiding it
or anything.

377
00:16:19,206 --> 00:16:21,241
Really? Because this
is the first time

378
00:16:21,308 --> 00:16:23,210
since I've known you you've
suggested we play a game

379
00:16:23,276 --> 00:16:24,977
that doesn't involve
money or nudity.

380
00:16:25,044 --> 00:16:28,315
We could play for
money if you want.

What do you say,
penny a point?

382
00:16:30,217 --> 00:16:33,153
We'll go to bed
when someone's up
a hundred bucks.

383
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:34,687
Come on,
are we gonna talk

384
00:16:34,754 --> 00:16:37,190
about the elephant
in the room or not?

385
00:16:37,257 --> 00:16:38,525
What's there
to talk about?

386
00:16:38,591 --> 00:16:40,193
I can't ring your
bell anymore,

387

old, I'll die,

388
00:16:41,628 --> 00:16:44,864
and you'll find happiness
with a vibrating egg.

389
00:16:44,931 --> 00:16:49,269
Did you ever stop
to consider that maybe
this isn't about you?

390
00:16:49,336 --> 00:16:50,870
No, not really.

391
00:16:50,937 --> 00:16:52,505
Well, it isn't.

392
00:16:52,572 --> 00:16:54,441
Then what's it about?

393
00:16:54,507 --> 00:16:56,309
It's personal.

394
00:16:56,376 --> 00:16:59,946
What's more personal
than bumping pee-pees?

395
00:17:03,116 --> 00:17:04,651
All right, fine.

396
00:17:09,222 --> 00:17:11,391
My ex-husband's
getting remarried.

397
00:17:12,859 --> 00:17:16,229
I'm sorry, are we still
having the same conversation?

398
00:17:17,630 --> 00:17:20,900
I know it sounds stupid,
but ever since I found out,

399
00:17:20,967 --> 00:17:23,270
I somehow felt shut down.

400
00:17:23,336 --> 00:17:24,404
Why?

401
00:17:24,471 --> 00:17:25,672
I don't know,
I guess because

402
00:17:25,738 --> 00:17:27,006
he's moving on
with his life.

403
00:17:27,073 --> 00:17:28,775
Yeah, but you're
getting married, too.

404
00:17:28,841 --> 00:17:31,244
Yeah, but I'm getting married
because I'm over him.

405
00:17:31,311 --> 00:17:33,480
He's getting married
because he's over me.

406
00:17:33,546 --> 00:17:34,647
Wait a minute,
wait a minute.

407
00:17:34,714 --> 00:17:36,015
Are you still
in love with him?

408
00:17:36,082 --> 00:17:38,151
Of course not, you idiot—
I'm in love with you.

409
00:17:38,218 --> 00:17:42,255
Well, good, good, because
I'm sure feeling loved.

I'm sorry.

411
00:17:44,357 --> 00:17:47,126
Okay, let me just make
sure I'm following this.

412
00:17:47,194 --> 00:17:48,728
Knowing that this guy
is getting married

413
00:17:48,795 --> 00:17:51,464
has somehow gotten in the
way of you having an orgasm.

414
00:17:51,531 --> 00:17:53,300
Maybe.

415
00:17:53,366 --> 00:17:54,701
I think so.

416
00:17:54,767 --> 00:17:56,836
Boy, women.

417
00:17:56,903 --> 00:17:58,471
What's that supposed to mean?

418
00:17:58,538 --> 00:18:00,106
Well, nothing, nothing.

419
00:18:00,173 --> 00:18:04,377
It's just I once had an orgasm
with a lawn dart in my foot.

420
00:18:07,614 --> 00:18:09,516
Do you think I'm crazy?

421
00:18:09,582 --> 00:18:10,650
No, no. No.

422
00:18:10,717 --> 00:18:12,185
Having sex right
over the hedge

423
00:18:12,252 --> 00:18:14,521
from where the kids were
throwing the lawn darts—

424
00:18:14,587 --> 00:18:16,656
that was crazy.

425
00:18:16,723 --> 00:18:19,226
And believe it or
not, I do understand.

426
00:18:19,292 --> 00:18:20,660
You do?
Well, sure.

427
00:18:20,727 --> 00:18:23,330
No one wants their former
lovers to be happy.

428
00:18:23,396 --> 00:18:25,164
They don't?
Well, hell, no.

429
00:18:25,232 --> 00:18:28,100
Most of my former
lovers want me dead.

430
00:18:29,436 --> 00:18:32,339
A couple have tried.

431
00:18:32,405 --> 00:18:36,409
In fact, now that I know you
have a vengeful, petty side,

432
00:18:36,476 --> 00:18:38,345
I love you even more.

433
00:18:38,411 --> 00:18:40,913
Thanks... I guess.

434
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:43,816
Don't worry about the sex.

435
00:18:43,883 --> 00:18:45,752
It'll work itself out,

436
00:18:45,818 --> 00:18:47,754
just like the lawn dart.

437
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:49,656
I love you, Charlie.
Well, you should.

438
00:18:49,722 --> 00:18:54,594
I'm being really sensitive and
understanding and all that crap.

439
00:18:54,661 --> 00:18:56,363
Now, how about
another game?

440
00:18:56,429 --> 00:18:59,499
All right.

00:19:02,068 --> 00:19:05,204
I'm kind of relieved to find
out I'm not the problem.

444
00:19:05,272 --> 00:19:06,573
Neither of us
is the problem.

445
00:19:06,639 --> 00:19:08,241
It's just that
I have feelings.

446
00:19:08,308 --> 00:19:10,810
Okay, for me, that
would be a problem.

You do realize that Jake
just snuck out of the house.

00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:14,914
Well, he's grounded.

449
00:19:14,981 --> 00:19:16,549

of the next hand gets

any guilt or reciprocity?
