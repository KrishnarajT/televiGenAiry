♪ Men.

2
00:00:03,827 --> 00:00:05,195
So what time
is your flight?

3
00:00:05,262 --> 00:00:06,129
8:00 a.m.

4
00:00:06,196 --> 00:00:07,765
8:00 a.m.?

5
00:00:07,831 --> 00:00:08,832
Wow.

6
00:00:08,899 --> 00:00:10,000
Yep.

7
00:00:10,067 --> 00:00:13,671
You want me to drive you?
That'd be nice.

8
00:00:13,737 --> 00:00:16,640
So what time you think
we should leave, around 6:00?

9
00:00:16,707 --> 00:00:18,375
To be on the safe side.

10
00:00:18,442 --> 00:00:20,010
Sure, sure.

11
00:00:20,077 --> 00:00:22,580
You never know with traffic
and airport security and all.

12
00:00:22,646 --> 00:00:24,715
Would you rather
I call a cab?

13
00:00:24,782 --> 00:00:27,150
No, no. No, I won't hear of it.

14
00:00:27,217 --> 00:00:29,086
I'll call one for you.

15
00:00:30,654 --> 00:00:31,922
Golly, I'm gonna miss you.

16
00:00:31,989 --> 00:00:35,058
A couple days without
sex won't kill you.

17
00:00:35,125 --> 00:00:36,627
It's not just sex.

18
00:00:36,694 --> 00:00:38,662
You're my friend,
my companion.

19
00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:42,866
And what makes you think
I'm not going to have sex?

20
00:00:42,933 --> 00:00:44,535
Excuse me?

21
00:00:44,602 --> 00:00:47,404
Hey, when the cat's away,
the mice masturbate.

22
00:00:49,239 --> 00:00:51,208
Tell you what,

23
00:00:51,274 --> 00:00:52,943
why don't you open
a bottle of wine,

24
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:56,313
come upstairs and I'll
give the mice something
to remember me by.

25
00:00:56,379 --> 00:00:58,415
Oh, yay, fresh memories.

26
00:00:59,717 --> 00:01:02,419
Much better than the video
of you on my iPhone.

27
00:01:03,754 --> 00:01:06,056
You took video of me
on your iPhone?

28
00:01:06,123 --> 00:01:07,558
Well, I...

29
00:01:07,625 --> 00:01:09,192
Just a little.

30
00:01:09,259 --> 00:01:13,931
I'd have asked permission,
but you were kind of busy.

31
00:01:13,997 --> 00:01:15,666
Give me the phone.

32
00:01:15,733 --> 00:01:17,067
Aw...

33
00:01:17,134 --> 00:01:19,036
Give it.

34
00:01:19,102 --> 00:01:22,039
Thank you.

35
00:01:22,105 --> 00:01:25,008
Oh, Charlie!

36
00:01:25,075 --> 00:01:27,545
What? You can't even tell
it's you.

37
00:01:27,611 --> 00:01:30,113
I can't turn my back
on you, can I?

38
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:33,250
Actually, I have photographic
evidence that you can.

39
00:01:33,316 --> 00:01:35,218
Not anymore.

40
00:01:35,285 --> 00:01:37,320
Aw...

41
00:01:37,387 --> 00:01:38,622
Don't pout.

42
00:01:38,689 --> 00:01:41,058
Just get the wine
and come upstairs.

43
00:01:41,124 --> 00:01:42,092
Okay.

44
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:43,426
And leave
the phone down here.

45
00:01:43,493 --> 00:01:45,395
Aw...

46
00:01:48,031 --> 00:01:52,703
Let's see, what's the proper
wine for the occasion?

47
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:55,706
Ah, who cares? Everything goes
with ass biting.

48
00:01:57,374 --> 00:01:58,809
Hey.

49
00:01:58,876 --> 00:02:00,310
Thought you were on a date.

50
00:02:00,377 --> 00:02:01,879
I was.

51
00:02:01,945 --> 00:02:03,346
It didn't go well.

52
00:02:03,413 --> 00:02:07,017
Really? You're usually
such a hit with the ladies.

53
00:02:07,084 --> 00:02:10,120
This might have been
the worst date of my life.

54
00:02:10,187 --> 00:02:11,722
Did she dress you in
a leather bustier

55
00:02:11,789 --> 00:02:13,223
and tie you to a bed?

56
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:14,424
No.

57
00:02:14,491 --> 00:02:17,561
Did she Super Glue a model car
to your balls?

58
00:02:17,628 --> 00:02:19,462
No.

59
00:02:19,529 --> 00:02:21,732
Did she talk you into putting on
one of Mom's dresses

60
00:02:21,799 --> 00:02:22,566
while she stole your wallet?

61
00:02:22,633 --> 00:02:24,301
No.

62
00:02:24,367 --> 00:02:27,370
Well, then this wasn't even
your worst date this month.

63
00:02:27,437 --> 00:02:29,172
I suppose.

64
00:02:29,239 --> 00:02:31,408
And thanks for the
highlight reel, by the way.

65
00:02:31,474 --> 00:02:32,475
Happy to help.

66
00:02:32,542 --> 00:02:35,078
I feel like going down
to the beach

67
00:02:35,145 --> 00:02:38,315
and diving into the ocean
and swimming out

68
00:02:38,381 --> 00:02:41,785
until my arms are so tired that
I sink below the waves

69
00:02:41,852 --> 00:02:43,120
into blessed oblivion.

70
00:02:43,186 --> 00:02:44,688
Hold on. Before you
do anything crazy,

71
00:02:44,755 --> 00:02:46,657
can you help me get
this bottle open?

72
00:02:46,724 --> 00:02:49,059
Sure. I mean...

73
00:02:49,126 --> 00:02:50,360
these women you meet online—

74
00:02:50,427 --> 00:02:52,596
you think you have
some kind of a connection,

75
00:02:52,663 --> 00:02:53,897
you know, a bond,

76
00:02:53,964 --> 00:02:55,032
and then you meet them
face-to-face

77
00:02:55,098 --> 00:02:56,499
and there's nothing.

78
00:02:56,566 --> 00:02:59,069
Just two lonely strangers
staring at each other

79
00:02:59,136 --> 00:03:01,271
across buffalo wings
and soft-serve ice cream.

80
00:03:01,338 --> 00:03:05,676
Well, maybe your problem
is taking them to a mall
food court on a first date.

81
00:03:05,743 --> 00:03:08,578
Well, excuse me, but I don't
want to make a big investment

82
00:03:08,646 --> 00:03:11,214
until I have a sense
of where things are going.

83
00:03:11,281 --> 00:03:13,651
Plus, the parking
is free.

84
00:03:13,717 --> 00:03:14,584
Here you go.

85
00:03:14,652 --> 00:03:16,754
Thank you.

86
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:18,355
Okay, well, good catching up.

87
00:03:18,421 --> 00:03:19,757
If you're going for that swim,

88
00:03:19,823 --> 00:03:21,424
make sure you tuck
your driver's license

89
00:03:21,491 --> 00:03:23,727
in your crack so I can
identify your body.

90
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:30,600
I mean, is it so much to ask
to make a connection with
another human being?

91
00:03:30,668 --> 00:03:32,469
No, it's not.

92
00:03:32,535 --> 00:03:34,805
I'm not even looking
for sex. I just want a
little companionship.

93
00:03:34,872 --> 00:03:36,239
That's rough. Buy a dog.

94
00:03:36,306 --> 00:03:38,208
You said I couldn't have
a dog in the house.

95
00:03:38,275 --> 00:03:41,712
Fine. Buy a dog and move.

96
00:03:41,779 --> 00:03:43,146
You know what would be great?

97
00:03:43,213 --> 00:03:45,983
If you could find a dog
with its own house.

98
00:03:46,049 --> 00:03:48,819
What's taking
you so long?

99
00:03:48,886 --> 00:03:50,020
Oh, hi, Alan.

100
00:03:50,087 --> 00:03:52,022
How was your date?
Awful.

101
00:03:52,089 --> 00:03:54,091
Oh, I'm sorry.
You want to talk about it?

102
00:03:54,157 --> 00:03:55,959
No. He's going
for a swim.

103
00:03:56,026 --> 00:03:58,862
Well, I-I could use
a friendly ear.

104
00:03:58,929 --> 00:04:02,399
Of course. Now tell me, this
is the girl you met online?

105
00:04:02,465 --> 00:04:05,135
Uh-huh. "Perky Dodger
fan in Tarzana."

106
00:04:05,202 --> 00:04:08,471
So what happened?
First of all, she wasn't
so much perky as porky.

107
00:04:09,539 --> 00:04:11,574
More like a Dodger Dog fan.

108
00:04:11,641 --> 00:04:14,011
Don't you hate it when people
misrepresent themselves?

109
00:04:14,077 --> 00:04:15,679
I do. When someone
makes a date with

110
00:04:15,746 --> 00:04:17,647
"Buff Malibu doctor,"
that's just what they get.

111
00:04:17,715 --> 00:04:19,449
(indistinct conversation)

112
00:04:19,516 --> 00:04:21,451
Apparently,
even when the cat's here,

113
00:04:21,518 --> 00:04:23,420
the mice have to masturbate.

118
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:35,365
Hey.

119
00:04:35,432 --> 00:04:36,967
Hey.

120
00:04:37,034 --> 00:04:38,601
(whistle blowing)

121
00:04:38,668 --> 00:04:40,137
Watching some football?

122
00:04:40,203 --> 00:04:41,772
No fooling you.

123
00:04:45,976 --> 00:04:47,677
Who are we rooting for?

124
00:04:47,745 --> 00:04:49,246
The spread.

125
00:04:51,314 --> 00:04:55,953
Ah, so we're making
an illegal wager.

126
00:04:56,019 --> 00:04:57,587
Technically.

127
00:04:57,654 --> 00:05:00,423
Don't get me wrong,
I'm not judging.

128
00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:03,360
It's really a victimless
crime, don't you think?

129
00:05:07,264 --> 00:05:08,565
So far.

130
00:05:11,568 --> 00:05:13,103
Sorry.

131
00:05:18,208 --> 00:05:20,744
Heard any good
jokes lately?

132
00:05:20,811 --> 00:05:24,214
Yeah.

133
00:05:24,281 --> 00:05:27,017
Two brothers are
sitting on a couch.

134
00:05:27,084 --> 00:05:30,754
One of them says,
"Heard any good jokes lately?"

135
00:05:30,821 --> 00:05:32,255
And then the other one—

136
00:05:32,322 --> 00:05:36,493
get this— the other
one lights him on fire.

137
00:05:45,235 --> 00:05:47,237
Okay, we'll just
watch the game.

138
00:05:47,304 --> 00:05:49,472
Thank you.

139
00:05:50,774 --> 00:05:52,442
All right, it's
a commercial.

140
00:05:52,509 --> 00:05:53,977
Now you can talk.

141
00:05:54,044 --> 00:05:56,679
Well, I was thinking,
with Chelsea out of town...

142
00:05:56,746 --> 00:06:00,217
Hold on, hold on, it's that
baby that trades stocks.

143
00:06:00,283 --> 00:06:03,220
I love this kid.

144
00:06:03,286 --> 00:06:04,221
(chuckles)

145
00:06:04,287 --> 00:06:05,823
Look at this...

146
00:06:10,828 --> 00:06:12,295
Okay, go ahead.

147
00:06:12,362 --> 00:06:16,233
I was thinking, with Chelsea
out of town,

148
00:06:16,299 --> 00:06:19,302
that maybe, you know,
after the game...

149
00:06:19,369 --> 00:06:22,705
you and I could go out
and grab a bite to eat.

150
00:06:22,772 --> 00:06:24,107
No, thanks.

151
00:06:24,174 --> 00:06:25,342
Not hungry?

152
00:06:25,408 --> 00:06:27,677
Don't like you.

153
00:06:27,744 --> 00:06:31,048
Oh, come on,
I need some human contact.

154
00:06:31,114 --> 00:06:32,315
(doorbell ringing)

155
00:06:32,382 --> 00:06:33,783
That's probably a human.

156
00:06:33,851 --> 00:06:35,452
Go contact them.

157
00:06:38,521 --> 00:06:40,390
That was clever.

158
00:06:40,457 --> 00:06:42,392
I'm a clever guy.

159
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:45,028
Well, hey, buddy.
You're here early.

160
00:06:45,095 --> 00:06:47,030
Oh, I was thinking,
that if you're hungry,

161
00:06:47,097 --> 00:06:49,166
you and I could grab
a bite to eat and...
(door closing)

162
00:06:49,232 --> 00:06:50,800
Maybe later.

163
00:06:50,868 --> 00:06:54,237
He's been a little crabby
since his girlfriend dumped him.

164
00:06:54,304 --> 00:06:56,739
The kid's a stone-cold
bummer, Alan.

165
00:06:56,806 --> 00:06:59,742
Okay, well, thanks
for dropping him off.

166
00:06:59,809 --> 00:07:01,979
You're welcome.
Oh, hey, Herb,

167
00:07:02,045 --> 00:07:05,782
by any chance, do you want to
go out and maybe grab a bite?

168
00:07:05,849 --> 00:07:07,384
Really? You and me?

169
00:07:07,450 --> 00:07:08,585
Sure. Why not?

170
00:07:08,651 --> 00:07:10,320
That's kind of weird, isn't it?

171
00:07:10,387 --> 00:07:12,522
I mean, you're the ex-husband,
I'm the current.

172
00:07:12,589 --> 00:07:14,324
So we've got
something in common.

173
00:07:14,391 --> 00:07:15,625
We do, don't we?

174
00:07:15,692 --> 00:07:16,759
Right.

175
00:07:16,826 --> 00:07:19,062
Neither one of us is
having sex with Judith.

176
00:07:19,129 --> 00:07:20,463
(laughing)

177
00:07:23,733 --> 00:07:26,236
That's actually a little
too close to home.

178
00:07:26,303 --> 00:07:27,337
Sorry.

179
00:07:27,404 --> 00:07:28,906

180
00:07:28,972 --> 00:07:30,107

00:07:31,441 --> 00:07:32,876
Uh, you ever been
to Kabob Kingdom?

183

Sure.

out of the fridge

191

Stop it. You love fart jokes
and pie.

hanging out

202
00:08:14,117 --> 00:08:16,219

I'd still have all three.

203
00:08:16,286 --> 00:08:17,887
Oh, come on, pal.

204
00:08:17,955 --> 00:08:19,856

aren't serious.

205

No, no, this wasn't puppy love.

207
00:08:24,061 --> 00:08:26,063
This was... dog love.

208
00:08:26,129 --> 00:08:29,899
Trust me, you have not had
dog love yet.

209
00:08:29,967 --> 00:08:32,569

had dog love yet.

she won't love you.

215
00:08:44,314 --> 00:08:46,416
