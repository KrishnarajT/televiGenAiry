I'm gonna hate this movie.

00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:07,375
How can you be so sure?

4
00:00:07,441 --> 00:00:10,043
It's got subtitles.

5
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:12,146
The only good subtitles
are for Nazis,

Oh, and Kung Fu.

00:00:17,251 --> 00:00:20,120
Excuse me, but NPR called
Hiroshima la Poubelle

9
00:00:20,188 --> 00:00:22,223
an "enchanting journey
of self-discovery."

10
00:00:22,290 --> 00:00:23,891
Well, they're not
gonna call it

11
00:00:23,957 --> 00:00:28,196
a "two-hour French snooze-fest
for pompous douche-buckets."

12
00:00:28,262 --> 00:00:29,897
Hey, you agreed that
if I paid for the tickets,

13
00:00:29,963 --> 00:00:31,299
we could see what
I want to see.

14
00:00:31,365 --> 00:00:33,201
That's because I
didn't actually think

15
00:00:33,267 --> 00:00:34,602
you could scrape
together 18 bucks

16
00:00:34,668 --> 00:00:36,204
without stopping
at a blood bank.

17
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:37,971
Well, it is
a small price to pay

18
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:39,473
to finally get you
out of the house.

19
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:41,074
It's been three weeks since
you and Chelsea broke up,

20
00:00:41,141 --> 00:00:42,376
and you need to move on.

00:00:42,443 --> 00:00:43,977

Hey, I bought those boobs.

24
00:00:46,714 --> 00:00:49,116
I have a right to look
at them once in a while.

25
00:00:53,086 --> 00:00:55,022
Damn. I don't
believe it.

26

No! It's Chelsea.

00:01:00,861 --> 00:01:02,296
She's with that Brad guy.

00:01:02,363 --> 00:01:03,797
So wh-what do we do?

32
00:01:03,864 --> 00:01:04,965
Do we say hello?

33
00:01:05,032 --> 00:01:06,867
No. We get the hell
out of here.

00:01:06,934 --> 00:01:08,469
CHELSEA:

Hey.

36
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:10,871
Look who's here.

37
00:01:10,938 --> 00:01:12,072
Alan, Chelsea's here.

38
00:01:12,139 --> 00:01:13,841
Oh, hey, Chelsea.

39
00:01:13,907 --> 00:01:14,808
Hi, Alan.

Good. Great.

43

Looking forward
to the movie.

00:01:20,281 --> 00:01:21,682
I'm surprised
to see you here.

00:01:21,749 --> 00:01:23,951
This doesn't strike me
as your cup of tea.

46

00:01:37,365 --> 00:01:39,032
Wow.

53
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:41,435
That was awkward.

54
00:01:41,502 --> 00:01:43,304
Tell me about it.

55
00:01:43,371 --> 00:01:44,938
Had to be tough for you.

56
00:01:45,005 --> 00:01:47,007
Your ex-fianceé
out with another guy?

00:01:47,074 --> 00:01:48,041
Uh-huh.

58
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:49,710
Good-looking guy.

59
00:01:49,777 --> 00:01:50,678
Yeah.

60
00:01:50,744 --> 00:01:53,013
You're here
with your brother.

61
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:54,181
I know.

62
00:01:54,248 --> 00:01:56,750
That'll tighten
the old sphincter.

Oh, God.

00:02:00,254 --> 00:02:01,722
You still want to go?

65

No. No, I'm not gonna give
her the satisfaction.

All right, but I think

72
00:02:22,476 --> 00:02:25,078
you should pay me back
for the tickets.

flick unless he figures

They're talking
about the movie.

103

He'll make up some crap
about how it made him cry.

Then he'll ask her in
for a cup of coffee,

00:03:58,539 --> 00:04:00,474
which he'll turn
into a glass of wine.

106

One thing leads to another,
and before you know it,

107
00:04:03,411 --> 00:04:06,480
he's got her in the bathtub
running like a jet ski.

At least that's
how I'd play it.

Mustache.

Don't worry. It's fake.

Put it on!

There is a whole side to you

142
00:05:21,455 --> 00:05:23,457
I don't want to know
anything about.

Hey, that's a good
look for you.

144
00:05:26,527 --> 00:05:28,395

I'm guessing.

00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:34,301
Look at that thing
he's driving.

147
00:05:34,367 --> 00:05:36,637
What? It's a Prius.
Of course
it's a Prius.

Hey, do not put down
the green lifestyle.

151
00:05:42,042 --> 00:05:43,276

very hard

00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:45,345
to reduce the size of
my carbon footprint.

153

Don't try to make it sound hip.

00:05:49,483 --> 00:05:52,419
All right, they're
getting out of the car.

156
00:05:52,486 --> 00:05:54,755
Oh, don't you just
love how he dresses?

157
00:05:54,822 --> 00:05:57,424
I mean, youthful, but
not trying too hard.

158
00:05:57,491 --> 00:05:59,593
Unlike some people.

159
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:03,096
Oh, great.
They're kissing.

160
00:06:03,163 --> 00:06:05,499
Good thing he doesn't know
where her mouth has been.

162
00:06:11,104 --> 00:06:13,173
He's getting
back in his car.

163
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,708
And there he goes.

164
00:06:14,775 --> 00:06:19,312
Well, denied,
Mr. Greenpeace Sissy Pants!

165
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:20,548
There. You feel better?

166
00:06:20,614 --> 00:06:22,082
Can we please
go home now?

167
00:06:22,149 --> 00:06:23,316
Wait, just a minute.

168
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:25,052
I want to make sure
she gets inside okay.

169
00:06:25,118 --> 00:06:28,121
You know, there's a soft side
to you that I just applaud.

170
00:06:28,188 --> 00:06:29,590
You don't let it
out very often,

171
00:06:29,657 --> 00:06:32,325
but when you do, it just
lights up the world.

172
00:06:34,427 --> 00:06:35,596
Wait a minute.

173
00:06:35,663 --> 00:06:37,364
Why is she getting in her car?

174
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:39,066
Where is she going
at this hour?

175
00:06:39,132 --> 00:06:41,835
Maybe there's a third guy,
and she's cheating on Brad.

176
00:06:41,902 --> 00:06:43,103
What?

177
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:45,939
Isn't that how

00:14:32,039 --> 00:14:34,307
You just cannot predict it.

359
00:14:34,374 --> 00:14:36,709
It's kind of an
emotional crapshoot.

360
00:14:36,776 --> 00:14:38,878
(snickers)

361
00:14:43,216 --> 00:14:46,219
Crapshoot.

362
00:14:46,286 --> 00:14:48,955
That just came to me,
right off the top of my head.

363
00:14:49,022 --> 00:14:50,790
(snorting laugh)

364
00:14:50,857 --> 00:14:52,359
Got it.

365
00:14:56,596 --> 00:14:58,298
But you are lucky.

366
00:14:58,365 --> 00:15:01,601
You've got your music
to express your feelings.

367
00:15:01,668 --> 00:15:05,072
I mean, you could play
the blues, for instance.

368
00:15:06,039 --> 00:15:09,476

I'm just saying it
seems like every time

00:15:44,111 --> 00:15:47,046
it's my turn to pick up
the crap, he's got the runs.

00:15:47,114 --> 00:15:49,482
Well, stop feeding
him chili.

381
00:15:49,549 --> 00:15:52,652
Oh, hey, Charlie.
Hey, Charlie.

382
00:15:52,719 --> 00:15:53,986
Hey, Tom, Ed.

383
00:15:54,053 --> 00:15:55,188
Are you looking
for Chelsea?

384
00:15:55,255 --> 00:15:57,524
No, he came to see
two old queens

385
00:15:57,590 --> 00:15:58,558
walking a dog.

386
00:15:58,625 --> 00:16:01,961
Who are you calling
a queen, Elizabeth?

387
00:16:02,028 --> 00:16:03,330
TOM:
She's not here, Charlie.

388
00:16:03,396 --> 00:16:05,432
She went to dinner
with that Brad guy.

389
00:16:05,498 --> 00:16:06,666
Oh.

390
00:16:06,733 --> 00:16:08,301
You want to come in,
have a beer?

391
00:16:08,368 --> 00:16:10,103
Nah, I don't want
to bother you guys.

392
00:16:10,170 --> 00:16:11,438
Don't be silly.
Come on.

393
00:16:11,504 --> 00:16:12,939
Okay, thanks.

394
00:16:14,006 --> 00:16:16,776
You had to tell him
she's with Brad?

395
00:16:16,843 --> 00:16:18,911
What, I'm
supposed to lie?

396
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:20,747
No, but you can dummy up.

397
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:22,582
I mean, look at
the poor bastard.

398
00:16:25,218 --> 00:16:27,987
I'm sorry.
I wasn't thinking.

399
00:16:28,054 --> 00:16:29,088
"I wasn't thinking."

400
00:16:29,156 --> 00:16:30,890
That should be
your middle name.

401
00:16:30,957 --> 00:16:34,661
Don't be getting in my face
when I'm holding a bag of poop.

402
00:16:38,165 --> 00:16:39,332
I'll grab some brews.

403
00:16:39,399 --> 00:16:42,169
Chelsea told me
about last night.

404
00:16:42,235 --> 00:16:43,170
I don't understand it, Tom.

405
00:16:43,236 --> 00:16:44,804
I thought we were
back together.

406
00:16:44,871 --> 00:16:47,207
Yeah, well, you can't
make sense out of a woman.

407
00:16:47,274 --> 00:16:49,876
They're like beautiful puzzles
with missing pieces,

408
00:16:49,942 --> 00:16:51,911
or a great book
with no ending,

409
00:16:51,978 --> 00:16:53,880
or like my old man
used to say,

410
00:16:53,946 --> 00:16:56,015
"They're all friggin' nuts."

411
00:16:57,517 --> 00:16:59,051
I don't know what to do.

412
00:16:59,118 --> 00:17:01,521
Should I leave her alone?
Should I pursue her?

413
00:17:01,588 --> 00:17:04,257
If I might chime in.

414
00:17:04,324 --> 00:17:07,594
I would say that
stopping by unannounced,

415
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:09,296
with some liquor store flowers,

416
00:17:09,362 --> 00:17:11,964
sends up a rather
desperate flare.

417
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:13,800
I know, I know.

418
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:16,169
I just couldn't sit home
and do nothing.

419
00:17:16,236 --> 00:17:17,637
I keep turning it over
in my mind.

420
00:17:17,704 --> 00:17:18,905
What did I do wrong?

421
00:17:18,971 --> 00:17:20,407
What could I have
done differently?

422
00:17:20,473 --> 00:17:23,142
Man, how many times
did I ask myself that question

423
00:17:23,210 --> 00:17:24,544
when I was married?

424
00:17:24,611 --> 00:17:25,645
Me, too.

425
00:17:25,712 --> 00:17:27,547
What have we got
between the two of us—

426
00:17:27,614 --> 00:17:29,015
something like 80
years of marriage?

427
00:17:29,081 --> 00:17:32,385
Let's see—
I was with Beth for 38,

428
00:17:32,452 --> 00:17:35,555
and you were with Martha
for 40, 41...

429
00:17:35,622 --> 00:17:37,824
I didn't need you to
actually do the math.

430
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:38,925
Don't bark at me.

431
00:17:38,991 --> 00:17:40,527
I'll beat the snot out of you.

432
00:17:40,593 --> 00:17:43,162
Bring it on, mister.

433
00:17:44,564 --> 00:17:45,665
Maybe I should go.

434
00:17:45,732 --> 00:17:46,899
No, no, no,
sit down.

435
00:17:46,966 --> 00:17:47,967
Finish your beer.

436
00:17:48,034 --> 00:17:49,336
We're just sparring.

437
00:17:49,402 --> 00:17:51,338
I love this broken-down
son of a bitch.

438
00:17:51,404 --> 00:17:53,506
Oh, for God's sake,
don't gay it up

439
00:17:53,573 --> 00:17:55,007
in front of company.

440
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:56,876
Now you listen
to me, young man,

441
00:17:56,943 --> 00:17:58,445
in the final analysis,

442
00:17:58,511 --> 00:18:01,013
it doesn't matter what
you did or didn't do.

443
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,649
You want Chelsea back?

444
00:18:02,715 --> 00:18:05,418
You've got to make her miss you
like you did last night.

445
00:18:05,485 --> 00:18:06,919
And she's not going
to miss you

446
00:18:06,986 --> 00:18:08,655
if you're squatting
in her living room

447
00:18:08,721 --> 00:18:11,624
with those sad-ass petunias.

448
00:18:11,691 --> 00:18:14,694
So, what, I'm supposed to just
go about my business

449
00:18:14,761 --> 00:18:16,429
hoping that one day
she shows up

450
00:18:16,496 --> 00:18:17,697
and says, "I'm back"?

451
00:18:17,764 --> 00:18:19,999
Or you can do
like me and Ed did.

452
00:18:20,066 --> 00:18:22,535
Change teams.

453
00:18:22,602 --> 00:18:26,105
A lot easier living
with a man than a woman.

454
00:18:26,172 --> 00:18:28,207
Tom and I watch
the same TV shows.

455
00:18:28,275 --> 00:18:29,709
We like the same food.

456
00:18:29,776 --> 00:18:31,878
You don't have to leave
the room to fart.

457
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:35,915
You don't have to, but it sure
would be a nice idea.

458
00:18:37,717 --> 00:18:40,520
Okay, well, thanks, fellas.

459
00:18:40,587 --> 00:18:42,955
This was real helpful.

460
00:18:43,022 --> 00:18:44,023
We're always here
for you, Charlie.

461
00:18:44,090 --> 00:18:45,525
Thank you.

462
00:18:45,592 --> 00:18:47,126
And don't tell Chelsea
I stopped by.

463
00:18:47,193 --> 00:18:48,261
I wouldn't dream of it.

464
00:18:48,328 --> 00:18:49,962
And remember
what we told you:

465
00:18:50,029 --> 00:18:50,997
lay low for a while.

466
00:18:51,063 --> 00:18:52,265
Run silent, run deep.

467
00:18:52,332 --> 00:18:54,000
There you go.

468
00:18:58,338 --> 00:18:59,772
Well, what do you think?

469
00:18:59,839 --> 00:19:03,810
Watch Sports Center
and then fool around a little?

470
00:19:03,876 --> 00:19:08,014
You, uh, you need
to take a Viagra?

471
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,116
You're my Viagra, baby.

472
00:19:10,182 --> 00:19:12,919
Ah, that's so sweet.

473
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:14,854
Just for that, you
can hold the remote.

474
00:19:17,357 --> 00:19:20,092
♪ Men.

475
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:24,797

476
00:19:24,864 --> 00:19:25,832
Hey.

477
00:19:25,898 --> 00:19:28,034
Sorry. Didn't mean
to disturb you.

478
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:29,268
Just grabbing a water.

479
00:19:29,336 --> 00:19:30,670
No, no, no, it's fine.

480
00:19:30,737 --> 00:19:32,405
Come on. Join me.

481
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:38,545
Really?

482
00:19:38,611 --> 00:19:40,913
Yeah, sit down.

483
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:43,416
Okay.

484
00:19:45,918 --> 00:19:47,387
(sighs)

485
00:19:47,454 --> 00:19:50,022
Listen, uh,

486
00:19:50,089 --> 00:19:53,726
I want to apologize
for... you know...

487
00:19:53,793 --> 00:19:56,429
Trying to kill me
with a pillow?

488
00:19:56,496 --> 00:19:58,365
It was horseplay.

489
00:19:58,431 --> 00:20:00,367
Don't make a big
thing about it.

490
00:20:00,433 --> 00:20:03,470
What I'm saying is that I know
you were trying to cheer me up,

491
00:20:03,536 --> 00:20:05,805
and I appreciate it.

492
00:20:05,872 --> 00:20:09,642
Thank you.

493
00:20:09,709 --> 00:20:13,880
I realize that I give you
a hard time about living here,

494
00:20:13,946 --> 00:20:15,314
but frankly,

495
00:20:15,382 --> 00:20:19,686
it's probably a
good thing to...

496
00:20:19,752 --> 00:20:21,488
have you around.

497
00:20:23,356 --> 00:20:25,492
Wow, Charlie.

498
00:20:25,558 --> 00:20:28,761
That means so much
to hear you say that.

499
00:20:28,828 --> 00:20:31,063
Well...

500
00:20:32,899 --> 00:20:36,268
I do... I do love you, buddy.

501
00:20:38,605 --> 00:20:41,641
(voice breaking):
And I love you, too.

502
00:20:41,708 --> 00:20:44,377
I know, I know.

503
00:20:44,444 --> 00:20:47,680
I don't want this moment
to ever end.

504
00:20:49,716 --> 00:20:51,250
Okay.

505
00:20:51,317 --> 00:20:53,953
I mean it.
I am not letting go.

506
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:56,155
Well, you're gonna have to,

507
00:20:56,222 --> 00:20:57,990
'cause it's starting
to get a little weird.

508
00:20:58,057 --> 00:20:59,626
We don't need women.

509
00:20:59,692 --> 00:21:01,260
We've got each other.

510
00:21:01,327 --> 00:21:05,698
All right, you brought
this on yourself.

511
00:21:05,765 --> 00:21:08,835
Don't worry.
I'll wait for you
on the other side.
