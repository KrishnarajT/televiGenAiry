Hey, Danny.

00:00:06,029 --> 00:00:07,998
Good morning, Melissa.

4
00:00:08,065 --> 00:00:12,035
You look lovely today.

5
00:00:12,102 --> 00:00:13,737
Thank you, Danny.

6
00:00:13,804 --> 00:00:15,473
I think he's got
a little thing for you.

7
00:00:15,539 --> 00:00:19,243
No, you've got
a little thing for her.

8
00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:22,045
I've got a croquet mallet
in my pants.

9

Danny, behave yourself.

10
00:00:24,982 --> 00:00:28,219
Alan, I thought I told you
to keep that doll in your room.

11
00:00:28,286 --> 00:00:29,520
Come on.

12
00:00:29,587 --> 00:00:31,655
He's got to feed
the broad sometime.

13
00:00:33,224 --> 00:00:34,158
See what I did there?

14
00:00:34,225 --> 00:00:35,993
You're so clever.

15
00:00:36,059 --> 00:00:38,529
How about spaghetti with pesto
for dinner tonight?

Oh, boy, with the pine nuts?
You got it.

17
00:00:41,899 --> 00:00:45,303
I've got your pine nuts
right here.

18
00:00:45,369 --> 00:00:46,470
Danny.

19
00:00:46,537 --> 00:00:48,939
Buy one, get one free.

20
00:00:49,006 --> 00:00:52,910
Okay, Alan, I'm only going
to ask you this once.

21
00:00:52,976 --> 00:00:55,513
Has little Miss Muppet
moved into my house?

22
00:00:55,579 --> 00:00:57,147
What? No. Huh-uh.

23
00:00:57,215 --> 00:00:59,783
Really?

24
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:01,084
and still here
when I get up.

25
00:01:01,151 --> 00:01:02,720
Well, to be fair, Charlie,

26
00:01:02,786 --> 00:01:06,390
you do have an erratic
sleep schedule.

27
00:01:06,457 --> 00:01:09,693
So you're saying I continually
miss it when she goes home?

28
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:12,029
Charlie, you missed Easter
last year.

29
00:01:12,095 --> 00:01:13,797
Was that the time I woke up

30
00:01:13,864 --> 00:01:17,100
with a Cadbury egg
melted in my shorts?

31
00:01:19,002 --> 00:01:21,305
Sadly enough, no.

32
00:01:23,006 --> 00:01:24,775
Okay, okay,
just so you understand

33
00:01:24,842 --> 00:01:27,878
this is my house and you don't
get to invite people to move in.

34
00:01:27,945 --> 00:01:29,179
Why do you keep harping on that?

35
00:01:29,247 --> 00:01:30,514
She is not living here.

36
00:01:30,581 --> 00:01:32,550
I'm just going to throw
in a load of laundry

37
00:01:32,616 --> 00:01:33,651
before I go to work.

38
00:01:35,619 --> 00:01:38,289

Hey, listen,
I was thinking.

We've already got a bed.

48
00:02:22,633 --> 00:02:24,435
And you're the one who's always
complaining about it.

49
00:02:24,502 --> 00:02:26,970
Oh, I complain
about a lot of things.

50
00:02:27,037 --> 00:02:28,706
Like, uh, like automatic
flush toilets.

51
00:02:28,772 --> 00:02:30,608
I mean, everything's gone
before you get a chance

52
00:02:30,674 --> 00:02:33,511
to turn around
and check out how you did.

53
00:02:33,577 --> 00:02:35,379
What the dickens
are you talking about?

54
00:02:35,446 --> 00:02:37,281
Let's just leave the furniture
the way it is.

55
00:02:37,348 --> 00:02:38,382
I don't want to rock the boat.

56
00:02:38,449 --> 00:02:39,883
How is getting
a decent bed

57
00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:43,887
rocking the boat?

58
00:02:43,954 --> 00:02:45,789
And-and no. I mean...

59
00:02:45,856 --> 00:02:47,057
It's still Charlie's house.

60
00:02:47,124 --> 00:02:49,226
But you pay rent?
Of course.

61
00:02:49,293 --> 00:02:51,228
I mean, you know,
the actual number fluctuates

62
00:02:51,295 --> 00:02:53,697
depending on the economy
and whether Charlie's conscious

63
00:02:53,764 --> 00:02:55,599
on the first of the month.
But yeah, I pay.

64
00:02:55,666 --> 00:02:58,536
Okay, then you need to start
standing up to him.

65
00:02:58,602 --> 00:02:59,803
Oh, please.

66
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:02,306
I stand up to him plenty.
Is that so?

67
00:03:06,276 --> 00:03:08,211
You think he likes
unsalted butter?

68
00:03:08,278 --> 00:03:09,480
He does not.

69
00:03:10,848 --> 00:03:12,816
Now you listen
to me, Alan Harper.

70
00:03:12,883 --> 00:03:15,553
You are a strong,
assertive man.

71
00:03:15,619 --> 00:03:18,055
I know that because I
couldn't be with you

72
00:03:18,121 --> 00:03:19,557
if you were anything less.

73
00:03:19,623 --> 00:03:21,625
Oh, well, yeah, I am.

74
00:03:21,692 --> 00:03:23,761
You know, I...
I don't want to flaunt

75
00:03:23,827 --> 00:03:29,600
my strong assertiveness by,
you know, asking for stuff.

76
00:03:29,667 --> 00:03:33,103
Alan, you need
to tell your brother

77
00:03:33,170 --> 00:03:35,539
well, then that is just
his tough noogies.

78
00:03:35,606 --> 00:03:38,409
Okay, I will tell him.

79
00:03:38,476 --> 00:03:40,511
Good.
But slowly.

80
00:03:40,578 --> 00:03:42,380
In increments.

81
00:03:42,446 --> 00:03:44,247
As I did with the butter.

82
00:03:44,314 --> 00:03:47,117
And how long did that take?

83
00:03:48,486 --> 00:03:49,687
That is not important.

84
00:03:49,753 --> 00:03:51,722
What's important is this is now

85
00:03:51,789 --> 00:03:53,757
a low sodium,
heart smart household.

86
00:03:57,428 --> 00:03:59,029
She's living here.

87
00:03:59,096 --> 00:04:01,865
He moved her in
right under my nose.

88
00:04:01,932 --> 00:04:03,133
So?

89
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:06,770
So this is
the unsalted butter again,

90
00:04:06,837 --> 00:04:09,940
but, you know, writ large.

91
00:04:13,511 --> 00:04:14,044
"What difference?"

92
00:04:14,111 --> 00:04:15,145
Are you kidding?

93
00:04:15,212 --> 00:04:16,880
First it's him
and his stinky kid

94
00:04:16,947 --> 00:04:20,117
and now he's shacking up
with Strawberry Shortcake!

95
00:04:20,183 --> 00:04:22,185
He pays rent,
doesn't he?

96
00:04:22,252 --> 00:04:23,654
I don't know.

97
00:04:23,721 --> 00:04:25,022
Once, maybe.

98
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:27,825
He says he did.

99
00:04:27,891 --> 00:04:31,228
So why do you care
who he has in his room?

100
00:04:31,294 --> 00:04:33,564
I care because...

101
00:04:33,631 --> 00:04:34,932
There's a principle involved.

102
00:04:34,998 --> 00:04:35,933
"A principle"?

103
00:04:35,999 --> 00:04:38,436
Yes! I made a rule.

104
00:04:38,502 --> 00:04:42,072
Ooh, you made a rule.

105
00:04:42,139 --> 00:04:43,707
Yes, I made a rule.

106
00:04:43,774 --> 00:04:44,808
And I'm making another one.

107
00:04:44,875 --> 00:04:47,177
You do not get
to mock my rules.

108
00:04:47,244 --> 00:04:49,179
You're being silly, Charlie.

109
00:04:49,246 --> 00:04:50,581
Melissa is
a wonderful girl.

110
00:04:50,648 --> 00:04:53,083
They love each other
and she makes him happy.

111
00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:56,219
And I care about
that because...?

112
00:04:56,286 --> 00:04:59,056
Because the Charlie Harper
that I fell in love with

113
00:04:59,122 --> 00:05:01,425
cares about other
people's happiness.

114
00:05:01,492 --> 00:05:04,227
That's the Charlie Harper
you fell in love with, huh?
Yes.

115
00:05:04,294 --> 00:05:07,064
Well, joke's on you.

116
00:05:07,130 --> 00:05:08,966
That whole nice guy
thing was a big act

117
00:05:09,032 --> 00:05:11,034
to get you to have sex with me.

118
00:05:11,101 --> 00:05:12,570
Ha-ha.

119
00:05:12,636 --> 00:05:15,372

right thing, Charlie.

120
00:05:16,607 --> 00:05:18,141

as you know, I pay my fair share
of rent around here.

133
00:05:55,713 --> 00:05:59,216
We probably have different
definitions of "fair."

134
00:05:59,282 --> 00:06:01,519
And "share."

135
00:06:01,585 --> 00:06:03,654

138
00:06:08,191 --> 00:06:10,894
Well, you're wrong.
Nice talking to you.

142
00:06:17,067 --> 00:06:18,936
And the fact is,
if Melissa moves in,

143
00:06:19,002 --> 00:06:21,505
that means you've got more
people living here than I do.

144
00:06:21,572 --> 00:06:22,973
So?

145
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:25,743
So there's a principle
involved...

146
00:06:29,913 --> 00:06:32,249
that we must discuss.

147
00:06:32,315 --> 00:06:35,085
Okay, so what's
the principle?

148
00:06:40,624 --> 00:06:43,527
The principle is that...

149
00:06:43,594 --> 00:06:47,030
you're my brother
and I want you to be happy.

150
00:06:48,966 --> 00:06:51,368
So Melissa can stay?

151
00:06:51,434 --> 00:06:52,536

152
00:06:56,306 --> 00:06:58,141

Hello, Charlie?

It's your mother.

182
00:08:17,721 --> 00:08:20,457
Remember me?

183
00:08:20,523 --> 00:08:23,226
for roughly
seven and a half months.

184
00:08:23,293 --> 00:08:25,729
Anyway, I'd say call me,
but what's the point?

185
00:08:25,796 --> 00:08:27,064
I've long since
given up expecting

186
00:08:27,130 --> 00:08:30,167

Hi.

193
00:08:47,751 --> 00:08:51,488
Oh, uh, just so you know,

194
00:08:51,554 --> 00:08:54,157
and you guys can
take the top and we'll
split the door, okay?

not just half.

liked that show.

I don't really
buy the premise.

00:16:48,365 --> 00:16:50,633

So they both just
up and left, huh?

365
00:17:01,578 --> 00:17:02,379
Yeah.
Uh-huh.

366
00:17:02,445 --> 00:17:05,114
Those boneless chickens.

367
00:17:05,182 --> 00:17:09,118
They'll be back.

368
00:17:09,186 --> 00:17:10,019
Damn right.

369
00:17:10,086 --> 00:17:11,754
Girl power, my bitches.

370
00:17:13,190 --> 00:17:15,425
Hey, Berta, why don't
you whip us up

371
00:17:15,492 --> 00:17:17,026
some French toast
to celebrate?

372
00:17:22,232 --> 00:17:24,667
Or, uh, we could do it.

373
00:17:24,734 --> 00:17:27,069
Good plan...

374
00:17:27,136 --> 00:17:28,638

EVELYN:
Hello, anybody home?

376
00:17:32,709 --> 00:17:34,511
In here.

377
00:17:34,577 --> 00:17:36,379
Oh, what a nice surprise.

378
00:17:36,446 --> 00:17:38,248
Good morning, ladies.

379
00:17:38,315 --> 00:17:40,250
Berta.

00:17:40,317 --> 00:17:42,285

381
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:45,455
So where are the
boys this morning?

382
00:17:45,522 --> 00:17:49,326
Oh, well, Charlie's
off sulking in a hotel.

383
00:17:49,392 --> 00:17:50,627
Oh, really?

384
00:17:50,693 --> 00:17:52,061
Well, what about Alan?

385
00:17:52,128 --> 00:17:54,864
Oh, Alan's too
cheap for a hotel.

386
00:17:54,931 --> 00:17:57,400
I see.
And what brought this on?

387
00:17:57,467 --> 00:17:59,035
A lot of macho nonsense.

388
00:17:59,101 --> 00:18:01,738
Mm, and Alan?

389
00:18:01,804 --> 00:18:04,073
Just nonsense.

390
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:08,177
No kidding.

391
00:18:08,245 --> 00:18:11,848
Thank you.
Thank you.

392
00:18:11,914 --> 00:18:15,117
have managed to put aside your
somewhat distasteful history

393
00:18:15,184 --> 00:18:17,220
and bond the way
you obviously have.

394
00:18:17,287 --> 00:18:18,621
What distasteful history?

395
00:18:18,688 --> 00:18:21,891
Oh, come on,
let them make my
breakfast first.

396
00:18:21,958 --> 00:18:23,893
What are you
talking about, Evelyn?

397
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:27,497
A lot of women might resent
the former lover of their fiancé

398
00:18:27,564 --> 00:18:29,766
living in the same
house as them.

399
00:18:30,767 --> 00:18:33,670
It ain't me, start cooking.

400
00:18:34,737 --> 00:18:35,872
You and Charlie?

401
00:18:35,938 --> 00:18:37,340
Just one little weekend.

402
00:18:37,407 --> 00:18:39,676
But believe me, if I knew
what kind of man he was,

403
00:18:39,742 --> 00:18:41,010
I never would have
let him touch me.

404
00:18:41,077 --> 00:18:42,379
What's that
supposed to mean?

405
00:18:42,445 --> 00:18:43,513
Oh, he's fine for you.

406
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:44,847
Fine for me?

407
00:18:44,914 --> 00:18:46,683
Well, I've got an early meeting.

408
00:18:46,749 --> 00:18:49,752
Nice to see you girls.

409
00:18:49,819 --> 00:18:50,920
Why didn't you
tell me?

410
00:18:50,987 --> 00:18:52,088
I thought you
were my friend!

411
00:18:52,154 --> 00:18:53,623
MELISSA:
I'm your friend?

412
00:18:53,690 --> 00:18:55,258
(arguing continues)

413
00:18:55,325 --> 00:18:58,495
CHELSEA:
Hey, if it weren't for me,

414
00:18:58,561 --> 00:19:01,831
I believe the balance of power
is restored.

415
00:19:01,898 --> 00:19:03,600
Thanks, Mom.

416
00:19:03,666 --> 00:19:04,934
Thank you.

417
00:19:07,136 --> 00:19:09,539
You owe me large.

that's fine.

Kidding. Love you.

Damn.

424
00:19:32,462 --> 00:19:34,431
Hey, at least Chelsea's
coming back.

425
00:19:34,497 --> 00:19:36,999
Melissa said she'll never
set foot in this house again.

426
00:19:37,066 --> 00:19:39,769
All's well that ends well, huh?

427
00:19:41,003 --> 00:19:43,139
Bite me.

428
00:19:47,577 --> 00:19:50,913
Oh, come on, the important thing
is, we got the house back.

429
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:53,215
And we're once again
kings of the castle.

430
00:19:53,282 --> 00:19:54,451
That's true.

431
00:19:54,517 --> 00:19:56,185
Hey, Celeste and
I are going to be

432
00:19:56,252 --> 00:19:57,854
studying in my room.
Okay.

433
00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:00,189
Oh, right.

434
00:20:00,256 --> 00:20:01,424
Set another place for dinner.

435
00:20:01,491 --> 00:20:02,692
She's going to be
joining us.

436
00:20:02,759 --> 00:20:05,495
Fine.

437
00:20:05,562 --> 00:20:09,366
Also, she's a vegetarian,
so no meat.

438
00:20:09,432 --> 00:20:10,867
Got it.

439
00:20:10,933 --> 00:20:12,101
Come on, Jake.

440
00:20:12,168 --> 00:20:14,303
Coming.

441
00:20:15,638 --> 00:20:18,074
Kings of the castle, my ass.

442
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:20,309
We're whipped
unto the third generation.
