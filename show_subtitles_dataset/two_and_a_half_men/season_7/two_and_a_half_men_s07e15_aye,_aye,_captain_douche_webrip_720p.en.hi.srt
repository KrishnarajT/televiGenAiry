1
00:00:05,128 --> 00:00:07,430
I was forced to use my hands
to defend a lady's honor.

2
00:00:07,497 --> 00:00:08,932
So I don't have
to go back to jail?

3
00:00:08,999 --> 00:00:10,668
You won't even see
the inside of a courtroom.

4
00:00:10,734 --> 00:00:12,469
You know, we're having
a nature ride

5
00:00:12,536 --> 00:00:13,604
and barbecue
for the kids

6
00:00:13,671 --> 00:00:14,905
this Saturday.
You should come.

7
00:00:14,972 --> 00:00:16,707
That sounds wonderful,
doesn't it, Charlie?

8
00:00:16,774 --> 00:00:17,908
You let her go
without you?

9
00:00:17,975 --> 00:00:20,210
Why the hell
would I want to go?

10
00:00:20,277 --> 00:00:21,478
Maybe you didn't notice the way

11
00:00:21,545 --> 00:00:23,213
my lawyer was looking
at your fiancée.

12
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:24,948
What are you talking about?

13
00:00:25,015 --> 00:00:27,417
Or the way she was
looking back at him.

14
00:00:27,484 --> 00:00:30,420
Charlie, that guy is
everything you're not.

15
00:00:32,355 --> 00:00:34,925
♪ Men. ♪

16
00:00:37,527 --> 00:00:38,962
Where the hell is she, Alan?

17
00:00:39,029 --> 00:00:40,798
Calm down; don't work
yourself into a tizzy.

18
00:00:40,864 --> 00:00:42,399
A tizzy?

19
00:00:42,465 --> 00:00:43,967
I don't have tizzies.

20
00:00:44,034 --> 00:00:45,869
Women have tizzies.
You have tizzies.

21
00:00:47,170 --> 00:00:51,775
Me, I am outraged,
I am furious, I am, I am...

22
00:00:51,842 --> 00:00:52,743
Miffed?

23
00:00:52,810 --> 00:00:54,612
Do not complete my sentences

24
00:00:54,678 --> 00:00:56,113
if you don't grasp the concept.

25
00:00:56,179 --> 00:00:57,881
Sorry.

26
00:00:57,948 --> 00:00:59,683
She should've been home
hours ago.

27
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:01,351
I'm sure there's a perfectly
good explanation.

28
00:01:01,418 --> 00:01:02,953
Oh, really?
And what would that be?

29
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:05,455
Okay, well, after
the barbecue ended,

30
00:01:05,522 --> 00:01:06,957
Chelsea stayed behind
to help clean up.

31
00:01:07,024 --> 00:01:09,359
And then she and Brad
got to talking

32
00:01:09,426 --> 00:01:10,894
about all the things
they have in common.

33
00:01:10,961 --> 00:01:13,897
You know, their love
of horses, children...

34
00:01:13,964 --> 00:01:15,933
Probably just
lost track of time.

35
00:01:15,999 --> 00:01:17,668
Because, you know,
he's so easy to talk to.

36
00:01:17,735 --> 00:01:19,202
Not to mention how...

37
00:01:19,269 --> 00:01:20,838
good-looking he is.

38
00:01:22,239 --> 00:01:24,441
Or she got diarrhea.

39
00:01:24,507 --> 00:01:26,644
Oh, maybe she called.

40
00:01:26,710 --> 00:01:29,079
Oh, look, there's
two messages.

41
00:01:29,146 --> 00:01:31,581
WOMAN: Hi. I'm calling
for Alan Harper.

42
00:01:31,649 --> 00:01:33,016
This is Jenny from
Malibu Day Spa.

43
00:01:33,083 --> 00:01:34,952
I just wanted to confirm
your Saturday appointment

44
00:01:35,018 --> 00:01:36,019
for a bikini wax.

45
00:01:38,255 --> 00:01:39,923
Bikini wax?

46
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:41,892
Uh, I wear a European-cut
bathing suit.

47
00:01:41,959 --> 00:01:44,027
I like to keep it
tidy down there.

48
00:01:44,094 --> 00:01:46,964
Anyway, I'm sure the
next one is Chelsea.

49
00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:48,832
Hi, Mr. Harper.
This is Jenny again.

50
00:01:48,899 --> 00:01:50,567
Just a reminder—
we can no longer accept

51
00:01:50,634 --> 00:01:52,335
a personal check from you...

52
00:01:52,402 --> 00:01:55,939
I should've just gone with her
to that stupid charity thing.

53
00:01:56,006 --> 00:01:57,407
True. If you'd made
a little effort,

54
00:01:57,474 --> 00:01:58,541
you wouldn't be in
this situation.

55
00:01:58,608 --> 00:01:59,977
But I bet she knew
I wouldn't go

56
00:02:00,043 --> 00:02:01,111
when she asked me.

57
00:02:01,178 --> 00:02:03,546
In fact, I bet she was
counting on me not going,

58
00:02:03,613 --> 00:02:05,215
so she could be alone
with this Brad guy.

59
00:02:05,282 --> 00:02:07,150
Do you really think Chelsea
would do something like that?

60
00:02:07,217 --> 00:02:08,585
Why not? That's what I'd do.

61
00:02:09,687 --> 00:02:11,955
I mean, hypothetically.

62
00:02:12,022 --> 00:02:14,024
If I were ever
in that situation.

63
00:02:14,091 --> 00:02:15,125
Again.

64
00:02:15,192 --> 00:02:17,027
Right.

65
00:02:17,094 --> 00:02:19,997
The point is, I've been honest
through this whole thing.

66
00:02:20,063 --> 00:02:21,932
She's the one who's
been deceitful.

67
00:02:21,999 --> 00:02:23,466
She's nothing but
a manipulative,

68
00:02:23,533 --> 00:02:24,935
calculating,
two-faced...

69
00:02:25,002 --> 00:02:25,803
Hey, honey.

70
00:02:25,869 --> 00:02:28,238
(sweetly):
Oh, hi, baby.

71
00:02:28,305 --> 00:02:29,239
How was the party?

72
00:02:29,306 --> 00:02:30,741
It was great.

73
00:02:30,808 --> 00:02:33,043
There was, like, 80 kids
taking turns riding a horse

74
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:35,045
for the first time
in their lives.

75
00:02:35,112 --> 00:02:37,314
So, what, there was
just one horse?

76
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:38,515
No.

77
00:02:38,581 --> 00:02:39,416
Good, 'cause that
would've been

78
00:02:39,482 --> 00:02:41,051
a tough day for the horse.

79
00:02:41,118 --> 00:02:43,987
Sorry I'm late, but after we
got the kids back on the busses,

80
00:02:44,054 --> 00:02:46,690
a bunch of us hung out
to chat and help clean up.

81
00:02:46,757 --> 00:02:48,491
Yeah, yeah, that's
what I figured.

82
00:02:48,558 --> 00:02:49,960
Anyway, I'm beat.

83
00:02:50,027 --> 00:02:52,195
I just want to jump in
the shower and go to bed.

84
00:02:52,262 --> 00:02:53,630
Okay, I'll be right up.

85
00:02:53,697 --> 00:02:56,133
Night, Alan.
Night.

86
00:02:56,199 --> 00:02:57,634
Glad you had a good time.

87
00:02:57,701 --> 00:02:59,236
Well done.

88
00:02:59,302 --> 00:03:02,205
You sublimated your anger and
came from a place of love.

89
00:03:02,272 --> 00:03:03,506
You took the high road.

90
00:03:03,573 --> 00:03:04,574
Really?

91
00:03:04,641 --> 00:03:05,976
Is that what you call it?

92
00:03:06,043 --> 00:03:08,311
'Cause I call it a
complete and total betrayal

93
00:03:08,378 --> 00:03:09,913
of my testicles.

94
00:03:11,048 --> 00:03:12,850
If you'd done it
as much as I had,

95
00:03:12,916 --> 00:03:14,952
you'd call it the high road.

Hey, Chels?

100
00:03:26,263 --> 00:03:29,967
So, when you say a bunch
of you stayed to clean up,

101
00:03:30,033 --> 00:03:31,501
how many are you
talking about?

102
00:03:31,568 --> 00:03:32,970
I don't know;
a couple.

103
00:03:33,036 --> 00:03:35,205
Uh-huh.

104
00:03:35,272 --> 00:03:37,574
You know, technically,
a couple is two.

105
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:39,376
So are you saying
there were two people

106
00:03:39,442 --> 00:03:42,679
in addition to you and Brad
or just you and Brad?

107
00:03:42,746 --> 00:03:44,247
What are you getting at?

108
00:03:44,314 --> 00:03:47,050
Nothing. Just trying to get
an accurate head count.

109
00:03:47,117 --> 00:03:48,852
You could've come with me,
you know.

110
00:03:48,919 --> 00:03:49,887
I know.

111
00:03:49,953 --> 00:03:51,221
It'd be nice for us

112
00:03:51,288 --> 00:03:53,423
to do some things together
once in a while.

113
00:03:53,490 --> 00:03:55,525
We do plenty of
things together.

114
00:03:55,592 --> 00:03:56,626
Besides sex.

115
00:03:56,693 --> 00:04:00,130
Oh...

116
00:04:00,197 --> 00:04:03,000
When Brad's wife was alive,
they played tennis every day.

117
00:04:03,066 --> 00:04:05,102
Probably what killed her.

118
00:04:05,168 --> 00:04:08,405
She was hit by a car.

119
00:04:08,471 --> 00:04:11,108
Maybe she was chasing
a tennis ball.

120
00:04:12,609 --> 00:04:14,912
You know, like a dog.

121
00:04:16,013 --> 00:04:18,281
You throw it,
they run after it,

122
00:04:18,348 --> 00:04:19,716

00:04:21,151 --> 00:04:23,153

try to sneak in at 2:00 a.m.

For your information, Chelsea's

172
00:06:20,904 --> 00:06:22,839
And she was smelling of horse.

173
00:06:22,906 --> 00:06:25,542

you can't compete with a horse.

I don't know, maybe the nine or
ten times I found you passed out

180
00:06:40,991 --> 00:06:43,994
in your bathtub, holding onto it
like it was a flotation device.

181
00:06:44,061 --> 00:06:46,563
Sorry about that.

182
00:06:46,629 --> 00:06:48,298
Don't be.

183
00:06:55,438 --> 00:06:56,706
Mmm, boy!

184
00:06:58,308 --> 00:06:59,676
Breakfast,

185
00:06:59,742 --> 00:07:02,912
the most important meal
of the day.

186
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:04,881
Three scrambled egg whites,

187
00:07:04,948 --> 00:07:08,585
two slices of "I can't believe
it's not buttered" rye toast

188
00:07:08,651 --> 00:07:10,220
and to flush it through me,

189
00:07:10,287 --> 00:07:14,491
a piping hot cup
of freshly ground coffee.

190
00:07:14,557 --> 00:07:15,692
(coffee grinder whirring)

191
00:07:15,758 --> 00:07:18,061
Shut that thing off!

192
00:07:25,468 --> 00:07:27,770
(whirring resumes)

193
00:07:41,351 --> 00:07:43,053
(crashing)

194
00:07:46,056 --> 00:07:48,758
So... decaf?

195
00:07:51,428 --> 00:07:52,662
Don't push me.

196
00:07:52,729 --> 00:07:54,564
I'm not in the mood.

197
00:07:54,631 --> 00:07:56,266
Did you sleep
on the couch last night?

198
00:07:56,333 --> 00:07:57,534
What's it to ya?

199
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,136
Oh, Charlie, what'd you do?

200
00:07:59,202 --> 00:08:01,171
Nothing.
Nothing?

201
00:08:01,238 --> 00:08:05,542
I may have compared Brad's
recently deceased wife

202
00:08:05,608 --> 00:08:07,510
to a ball-chasing dog.

203
00:08:07,577 --> 00:08:09,579
Whose balls?

204
00:08:09,646 --> 00:08:12,049
Tennis balls.

205
00:08:12,115 --> 00:08:14,251
Get your mind out of the gutter.

206
00:08:14,317 --> 00:08:17,720
All right, look— while this is
admittedly a bump in the road,

207
00:08:17,787 --> 00:08:19,356
you do have an opportunity here

208
00:08:19,422 --> 00:08:21,524
to really improve your
relationship with Chelsea.

209
00:08:21,591 --> 00:08:22,525
How do you figure?

210
00:08:22,592 --> 00:08:23,993
Well, think about it—

211
00:08:24,061 --> 00:08:25,662
the reason you're
threatened by Brad

212
00:08:25,728 --> 00:08:28,131
is because he's a much
better man than you.

213
00:08:29,666 --> 00:08:31,000
No, he's not.

214
00:08:31,068 --> 00:08:33,770
I would never come on
to another guy's fiancée.

215
00:08:33,836 --> 00:08:35,105
Okay, first of all,
we don't know

216
00:08:35,172 --> 00:08:36,439
that he's come on to Chelsea.

217
00:08:36,506 --> 00:08:38,241
And secondly, I've seen you
hit on a bride

218
00:08:38,308 --> 00:08:40,043
while she was walking down
the aisle.

219
00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:41,411
That was a joke.

220
00:08:41,478 --> 00:08:44,013
I asked her what
she was doing later.
Everybody laughed.

221
00:08:44,081 --> 00:08:47,717
My point is, if Chelsea is
looking around for a better guy,

222
00:08:47,784 --> 00:08:49,486
why not make that guy you?

223
00:08:49,552 --> 00:08:53,190
Because I'm not
a better guy than me.

224
00:08:53,256 --> 00:08:54,657
Not yet.

225
00:08:54,724 --> 00:08:57,327
But you do have something
going for you that Brad doesn't.

226
00:08:57,394 --> 00:08:58,395
What's that?

227
00:08:58,461 --> 00:09:00,697
Room to improve.

228
00:09:02,099 --> 00:09:05,735
Lots and lots of
room to improve.

229
00:09:05,802 --> 00:09:08,405
Thanks. You've filled
me with optimism.

230
00:09:08,471 --> 00:09:10,607
And keep in mind, you're
the underdog here,

231
00:09:10,673 --> 00:09:11,708
and everybody loves an underdog.

232
00:09:11,774 --> 00:09:15,245
Then how come
nobody loves you?

233
00:09:16,646 --> 00:09:18,081
The principle is still sound.

234
00:09:18,148 --> 00:09:20,217
Just go up there and
tell Chelsea you know

235
00:09:20,283 --> 00:09:22,018
that you're a
flawed human being,

236
00:09:22,085 --> 00:09:25,988
but that you will spend the rest
of your life trying to be better

237
00:09:26,055 --> 00:09:27,690
because she deserves the best.

238
00:09:27,757 --> 00:09:30,593
So, lie.

239
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:32,061
You don't have to lie.

240
00:09:32,129 --> 00:09:33,630
Don't you think
you're a flawed human being?

241
00:09:33,696 --> 00:09:35,898
Of course I do.
But I know me.

242
00:09:35,965 --> 00:09:38,301
I'm not gonna spend the rest
of my life doing anything,

243
00:09:38,368 --> 00:09:40,603
let alone try to be
a better human being.

244
00:09:40,670 --> 00:09:42,172
Oh, come on, Charlie.

245
00:09:42,239 --> 00:09:45,108
Look at every New Year's
resolution I've ever made.

246
00:09:45,175 --> 00:09:48,278
I've got the best of intentions,
but by January third or fourth,

247
00:09:48,345 --> 00:09:52,215
there I am broke, hung over, and
coughing up stripper glitter.

248
00:09:52,282 --> 00:09:54,217
Okay, lie.

249

♪ Men. ♪

250
00:09:58,221 --> 00:10:02,159
Hey Chels... I brought
you some orange juice.

251
00:10:02,225 --> 00:10:02,959
Thank you.

252
00:10:03,025 --> 00:10:04,394
Is there any coffee?

253
00:10:04,461 --> 00:10:08,731
No, no, my stupid brother
broke the grinder.

254
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:13,603
There's vodka
in this orange juice.

255
00:10:13,670 --> 00:10:16,539
Whoopsie, that's mine.

256
00:10:16,606 --> 00:10:18,675
It's 8:00 in the morning.

257
00:10:18,741 --> 00:10:21,043
Hence the orange juice.

258
00:10:22,879 --> 00:10:26,983
So, listen, I wanted
to apologize again

259
00:10:27,049 --> 00:10:29,486
about my unfortunate
remarks last night.

260
00:10:29,552 --> 00:10:32,589
And tell you I love you and
I'll spend the rest of my life

261
00:10:32,655 --> 00:10:35,592
trying to be a better man
because you deserve the best.

262
00:10:35,658 --> 00:10:37,627
Well, I appreciate
you saying that.

263
00:10:37,694 --> 00:10:41,464
So... we're good?

264
00:10:41,531 --> 00:10:43,733
Yeah.

265
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,067
Great.

266
00:10:45,134 --> 00:10:46,936
So what do you want
to do today?

267
00:10:47,003 --> 00:10:49,272
Your choice— whatever
makes you happy.
Really?

268
00:10:49,339 --> 00:10:51,674
I'll go anywhere,
I'll do anything.

269
00:10:51,741 --> 00:10:53,142
Of course, you'll
have to drive.

270
00:10:53,210 --> 00:10:55,678
Well, I was thinking
of going to Beverly Hills

271
00:10:55,745 --> 00:10:57,314
for this charity blood drive.

272
00:10:57,380 --> 00:10:58,181
Great.

273
00:10:58,248 --> 00:11:01,218
We'll give blood together.

274
00:11:01,284 --> 00:11:02,985
than tapping a vein
for a good cause.

275
00:11:03,052 --> 00:11:05,522
Terrific.
Brad will be happy to see us.

276
00:11:05,588 --> 00:11:07,557
Brad?

277
00:11:07,624 --> 00:11:08,991
It's his charity.

278
00:11:09,058 --> 00:11:11,127
He's got another charity?

279
00:11:11,194 --> 00:11:13,062
What the hell's
this guy's problem?

280
00:11:13,129 --> 00:11:15,332
It's not a problem, Charlie.

281
00:11:15,398 --> 00:11:17,434
He's a very caring
and compassionate man.

282
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:19,469
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
he's a freakin' saint.

283
00:11:19,536 --> 00:11:23,105
And you were already
planning on seeing him again.

284
00:11:23,172 --> 00:11:24,341
Well, yeah. He told me

285
00:11:24,407 --> 00:11:26,075
about the blood drive
last night.

286
00:11:26,142 --> 00:11:29,279
Right, right, while you were
"cleaning up."

287
00:11:29,346 --> 00:11:30,680
What's "this"?

288
00:11:30,747 --> 00:11:33,516
Oh, I think you know
what "this" is.

289
00:11:34,717 --> 00:11:35,752

00:11:40,823 --> 00:11:42,091
I am not sneaking around!

294
00:11:42,158 --> 00:11:43,693
I asked you
to go with me!

295
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,262
Figuring that I wouldn't.

296
00:11:45,328 --> 00:11:46,263

Okay, first of all, I have
nothing to be sorry about.

And second, I am not gonna
discuss my personal life

She's not here.

318
00:12:41,183 --> 00:12:42,719
She told him to go to hell.

319
00:12:42,785 --> 00:12:44,521
Will you please shut up?

320
00:12:44,587 --> 00:12:47,123

321
00:12:47,189 --> 00:12:48,491
