so her dad's out
of the hospital?

49
00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:35,559
Yep. They gave him his new hip
and sent him home.

50
00:01:35,626 --> 00:01:36,694
Huh.

51
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:38,228
So, he had a bad hip?

52
00:01:38,296 --> 00:01:39,497
No, Alan, he has
a bad tooth,

53
00:01:39,563 --> 00:01:41,632

the wrong doctor.

54
00:01:41,699 --> 00:01:42,866
You don't have
to be snide.

55
00:01:42,933 --> 00:01:44,835
You don't have to ask
dumb-ass questions.

00:06:18,441 --> 00:06:22,479
and slide it
into the spot.

179
00:06:22,546 --> 00:06:23,847
Parallel parking.

180
00:06:23,914 --> 00:06:25,583
Easy peasy.

181
00:06:25,649 --> 00:06:26,884
Are we home?

182
00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:28,451
We're dropping off Jake.

183
00:06:28,518 --> 00:06:29,720
Oh.

184
00:06:29,787 --> 00:06:31,955
I kind of got a sugar crash
off that ice cream.

185
00:06:32,022 --> 00:06:33,456
Oh, yeah, it had
nothing to do

186
00:06:33,523 --> 00:06:36,059
with the four ounces of liqueur
you poured over it.

187
00:06:36,126 --> 00:06:38,796
Better liqueur
than Halloween leftovers.

188
00:06:38,862 --> 00:06:41,098
They charge 50 cents
for each topping,

189
00:06:41,164 --> 00:06:43,100
and I had perfectly good
candy corn.

190
00:06:44,001 --> 00:06:45,068
Okay, bye.

191
00:06:45,135 --> 00:06:46,269
See you next weekend.

192
00:06:46,336 --> 00:06:48,238
Yeah, maybe.
What's that mean?

193
00:06:48,305 --> 00:06:50,373
I'll call you.

194
00:06:52,142 --> 00:06:53,944
Okeydoke.

195
00:06:54,912 --> 00:06:56,714
Boy, you really
pissed him off.

196
00:06:56,780 --> 00:06:59,216
I pissed him off?
What about you?

197
00:06:59,282 --> 00:07:00,317
Hey, he likes me.

198
00:07:00,383 --> 00:07:02,152
Oh, please.
Nobody likes you.

199
00:07:02,219 --> 00:07:05,589
We only tolerate you because
you have a lot of money.

200
00:07:05,656 --> 00:07:06,990
All right, get out.

201
00:07:07,057 --> 00:07:08,125
What are you
talking about?

202
00:07:08,191 --> 00:07:09,827
This is my car.
Fine.

203
00:07:09,893 --> 00:07:11,128
How much
do you want for it?

204
00:07:11,194 --> 00:07:14,564
(scoffs)
Don't be ridiculous.

205
00:07:14,632 --> 00:07:19,336
We talking blue book?
'Cause I just put
a new tire on it.

Thank you.

00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:45,128
I challenge.

219
00:07:49,432 --> 00:07:52,002
Okay, fine.
You're a narcissist.

220
00:07:52,069 --> 00:07:53,704
Better.

221
00:07:53,771 --> 00:07:56,907

You are odd...

224
00:08:06,316 --> 00:08:08,318
ly shaped.

225
00:08:08,385 --> 00:08:09,887
(phone ringing)
Hang on.

226
00:08:10,821 --> 00:08:12,690
You are a parasite.

227
00:08:12,756 --> 00:08:13,757
Not your turn.

228
00:08:13,824 --> 00:08:15,525
Hello.

229
00:08:15,592 --> 00:08:18,095
Oh, hey, Judith.
What's up?

230
00:08:18,161 --> 00:08:20,097
What do you mean, what
happened with Jake?

231
00:08:20,163 --> 00:08:21,631
We had a nice weekend.

232
00:08:21,699 --> 00:08:24,968
Well, we went driving, to
the movies, um, ice cream.

233
00:08:25,035 --> 00:08:26,303
Quack, rectal, suck-wad!

234
00:08:28,105 --> 00:08:29,639
I never got my "P."

235
00:08:29,707 --> 00:08:32,209
All you do is pee.

236
00:08:32,275 --> 00:08:33,677
What? What?
Uh, n-nothing.

237
00:08:33,744 --> 00:08:35,112
Little... little word game.
You know,

238
00:08:35,178 --> 00:08:36,246
exercise the brain.
Twit!

239
00:08:36,313 --> 00:08:37,681
Turd burglar!

240
00:08:39,516 --> 00:08:42,119
Judith, I-I-I don't know
what Jake's problem is.

241
00:08:42,185 --> 00:08:44,254
We had a terrific weekend.

242
00:08:44,321 --> 00:08:45,789
Huh.

243
00:08:45,856 --> 00:08:48,358
Jake says he doesn't want
to come here anymore.

244
00:08:48,425 --> 00:08:50,193
Really? Why?

245
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:52,029
I don't know.

246
00:08:52,095 --> 00:08:53,731
Did he say why?

247
00:08:53,797 --> 00:08:55,833
Charlie and I don't bicker.

248
00:08:57,167 --> 00:09:00,103
I mean, no more
than any other couple.

249
00:09:02,439 --> 00:09:04,207
Of guys.

250
00:09:04,274 --> 00:09:06,043
Right?

251
00:09:06,109 --> 00:09:07,010
Right.

252
00:09:07,077 --> 00:09:07,644
Oh, oh, oh!

253
00:09:07,711 --> 00:09:08,712
You are a eunuch.

254
00:09:08,779 --> 00:09:09,780
(sighs)

255
00:09:09,847 --> 00:09:11,982
That's "E," not "U."

256
00:09:12,049 --> 00:09:13,616
Learn to spell. Useless!

257
00:09:15,252 --> 00:09:17,554
Look, I don't know
what to tell you.

258
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:19,389
He's a teenager—
he'll get over it.

259
00:09:19,456 --> 00:09:21,291
Okay. Okay.

260
00:09:21,358 --> 00:09:22,659
Bye-bye.

261
00:09:22,726 --> 00:09:23,994
Well, I hope you're happy.

262
00:09:24,061 --> 00:09:26,496
I haven't been happy
in seven years.

263
00:09:26,563 --> 00:09:28,198
For your information,
I will not

264
00:09:28,265 --> 00:09:29,967
have been here seven years
until next fall.

265
00:09:30,033 --> 00:09:32,102
Oh, good to know.

266
00:09:32,169 --> 00:09:33,737
Circle the date
on the calendar

267
00:09:33,804 --> 00:09:35,505
so I'll know when
to hang myself.

268
00:09:35,572 --> 00:09:36,874
Ha, ha. Funny.

269
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:38,208
It-it's because of you
Jake doesn't want

270
00:09:38,275 --> 00:09:40,177
to come here anymore.
Great.

271
00:09:40,243 --> 00:09:42,813
Tell me what I did
so I can do it to you.

272
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,081
(sighs)

273
00:09:44,147 --> 00:09:46,116
God, you are such a...

274
00:09:46,183 --> 00:09:47,350
What are we up to?
"V."

275
00:09:47,417 --> 00:09:48,986
Varmint!

276
00:09:49,052 --> 00:09:50,587
You are a varmint.

277
00:09:50,653 --> 00:09:52,555
Yeah, well...

278
00:09:52,622 --> 00:09:54,524
you are a vagina.

279
00:09:58,561 --> 00:10:00,063
You're calling me a vagina?

280
00:10:00,130 --> 00:10:01,231
No, no, no, no, no.

281
00:10:01,298 --> 00:10:02,599
No, that's too good for you.

282
00:10:03,867 --> 00:10:06,669
What you are is...

283
00:10:06,736 --> 00:10:08,772
vagina adjacent.

284
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,641
You know,
for some women,

285
00:10:11,708 --> 00:10:14,845
this could be considered
a hostile work environment.

286
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:19,883
♪ Men. ♪

287
00:10:21,618 --> 00:10:23,320
Hey.

288
00:10:23,386 --> 00:10:25,856
Isn't it past
your bedtime?

289
00:10:27,157 --> 00:10:30,160
I don't like to go
to sleep angry.

290
00:10:30,227 --> 00:10:31,962
Try drinking more.

291
00:10:33,296 --> 00:10:34,898
What will that solve?

292
00:10:34,965 --> 00:10:36,766
Sobriety.

293
00:10:38,401 --> 00:10:40,170
We need to talk.

294
00:10:40,237 --> 00:10:41,338
Oh, good.

295
00:10:41,404 --> 00:10:44,307
I was so worried
we weren't going to talk.

296
00:10:45,508 --> 00:10:46,844
I've been thinking.

297
00:10:46,910 --> 00:10:48,378
Maybe Jake not wanting
to hang out here

298
00:10:48,445 --> 00:10:49,746
does have something
to do with us.

299
00:10:49,813 --> 00:10:51,314
I mean, we have been
fighting a lot lately.

300
00:10:51,381 --> 00:10:52,883
So?

301
00:10:52,950 --> 00:10:54,751
So, don't you want him
to feel comfortable here?

302
00:10:54,818 --> 00:10:55,986
He farts at the dinner table.

303
00:10:56,053 --> 00:10:58,388
How much more comfortable
do we want him?

304
00:10:58,455 --> 00:11:01,258
Charlie, if you and I don't
figure out a way to get along,

305
00:11:01,324 --> 00:11:03,193
there's a chance
we might not see him anymore.

306
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:06,196
And the downside is...?

307
00:11:06,263 --> 00:11:08,565
Come on, tough guy,
you know you love him.

308
00:11:08,631 --> 00:11:10,100
Why don't you just admit it?

309
00:11:10,167 --> 00:11:11,168
Okay, I love him.

310
00:11:11,234 --> 00:11:13,636
Now go to your room
and masturbate.

311
00:11:17,507 --> 00:11:19,776
Already did,
still can't sleep.

312
00:11:25,348 --> 00:11:28,785
My point is, we have
to work out our differences

313
00:11:28,852 --> 00:11:31,021
for the sake of the child.

314
00:11:32,489 --> 00:11:34,424
Are you out of your mind?

315
00:11:34,491 --> 00:11:35,792
I mean,
if it weren't for Jake,

316
00:11:35,859 --> 00:11:37,327
we could just shake hands
and walk away.

317
00:11:37,394 --> 00:11:40,430
After what you've been doing,
there'll be no shaking of hands.

318
00:11:43,133 --> 00:11:44,001
I keep Purell
in my nightstand.

319
00:11:44,067 --> 00:11:46,803
I'm not an animal.

320
00:11:48,171 --> 00:11:50,440
Where is this going, Alan?

321
00:11:50,507 --> 00:11:53,010
Well, I am glad you asked.

322
00:11:54,111 --> 00:11:56,113
A Blueprint for Love?

323
00:11:56,179 --> 00:11:58,781
It's a workbook Judith
and I got in couples counseling.

324
00:11:58,848 --> 00:12:00,017
But the principles
can be applied

325
00:12:00,083 --> 00:12:01,784
to any two human beings
in a relationship.

326
00:12:01,851 --> 00:12:03,453
I see.

327
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:06,589
So you did this right
before she kicked your ass out

328
00:12:06,656 --> 00:12:08,025
and took everything you own?

329
00:12:08,091 --> 00:12:10,193
The principles are sound.

330
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:12,529
Judith is
an unreasonable bitch.

331
00:12:13,897 --> 00:12:18,001
Now, okay, uh, the, um,
the first exercise—

332
00:12:18,068 --> 00:12:20,037
"Building a Foundation
of Trust."

333
00:12:20,103 --> 00:12:22,906
So, we each say three things
we admire about the other.

334
00:12:22,973 --> 00:12:24,274
Uh, I will go first.
Um...

335
00:12:24,341 --> 00:12:27,110
I admire your sense of humor,

336
00:12:27,177 --> 00:12:29,279
uh, your generosity

337
00:12:29,346 --> 00:12:31,481
and your devil-may-care
attitude.

338
00:12:31,548 --> 00:12:33,483
Thank you.

339
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:36,419
Now, your turn— three things
you admire about me.

340
00:12:40,690 --> 00:12:42,625
Three? Really?

341
00:12:44,995 --> 00:12:46,930
All right, uh...

342
00:12:46,997 --> 00:12:49,499
I like that you think I'm funny.

343
00:12:49,566 --> 00:12:50,300
(laughs)

344
00:12:50,367 --> 00:12:51,868
Good one.

345
00:12:51,935 --> 00:12:53,336
Still counts, right?

346
00:12:54,437 --> 00:12:56,473
Sure.

347
00:12:56,539 --> 00:12:57,740
Two to go.

348
00:12:57,807 --> 00:12:59,276
What did Judith put?

349
00:12:59,342 --> 00:13:02,245
No cheating.

350
00:13:02,312 --> 00:13:02,980
Okay.

351
00:13:03,046 --> 00:13:04,581
Uh...

352
00:13:04,647 --> 00:13:06,916
you love your kid,
which can't be easy.

353
00:13:10,287 --> 00:13:12,855
And...

354
00:13:12,922 --> 00:13:16,193
you disinfect your hands
after you masturbate.

355
00:13:19,963 --> 00:13:22,232
Thank you.

356
00:13:22,299 --> 00:13:23,967
Now, that wasn't
so difficult, was it?

357
00:13:24,034 --> 00:13:25,835
Okay, next.

358
00:13:25,902 --> 00:13:27,637
There's more?

359
00:13:27,704 --> 00:13:29,039
Have we healed our relationship,
Charlie?

360
00:13:29,106 --> 00:13:32,142
I'm good.

361
00:13:32,209 --> 00:13:34,877
Okay: "Three things you would
change about your partner,

362
00:13:34,944 --> 00:13:37,114
and three things you would
change about yourself."

363
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:38,315
This time you start.

364
00:13:38,381 --> 00:13:42,352
Why would I want
to change anything about myself?

365
00:13:42,419 --> 00:13:43,486
You're kidding, right?

366
00:13:43,553 --> 00:13:44,988
You think you're perfect?

367
00:13:45,055 --> 00:13:47,124
In my way.

368
00:13:47,190 --> 00:13:48,625
Oh, so you have no flaws?

369
00:13:48,691 --> 00:13:51,995
Let us consider
the hummingbird, Alan.

370
00:13:53,496 --> 00:13:55,132
Or the butterfly.

371
00:13:55,198 --> 00:13:56,399
All of God's
creatures are perfect

372
00:13:56,466 --> 00:13:59,236
just the way
he made them.

373
00:13:59,302 --> 00:14:03,173
Except you.
You suck.

374
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:04,974
Okay. Okay, fine.

375
00:14:05,042 --> 00:14:07,377
Name three things
you would change about me.

376
00:14:07,444 --> 00:14:09,612
Your personality,

377
00:14:09,679 --> 00:14:12,049
your wardrobe and your address.

378
00:14:17,954 --> 00:14:20,957
Thank you.

379
00:14:21,024 --> 00:14:22,625

380
00:14:22,692 --> 00:14:24,961

and again, your address.

381
00:14:26,496 --> 00:14:27,564
All right... (anxious laugh)
All right.

382
00:14:27,630 --> 00:14:29,699
Your haircut, your
fruity little workbook

383
00:14:29,766 --> 00:14:31,101
and your address.

384
00:14:31,168 --> 00:14:34,837
Just... Just needed three.

385
00:14:34,904 --> 00:14:37,274
Oh, come on,
we're healing.

386
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:39,109
Your cheapness,

387
00:14:39,176 --> 00:14:41,744
your smug arrogance
and your address.

388
00:14:41,811 --> 00:14:44,081
I'm leaving.

389
00:14:44,981 --> 00:14:48,851

That stopped being funny
a week ago.

Judges?

395
00:15:06,169 --> 00:15:07,737
Still funny.

396
00:15:09,506 --> 00:15:11,374
So where's the kid
this weekend?

397
00:15:11,441 --> 00:15:13,243
He's not coming,
thanks to my brother.

398
00:15:13,310 --> 00:15:15,578
Thank you, Charlie.

399
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:19,482
Sure, lay it
all on me.

400
00:15:19,549 --> 00:15:20,983
Nothing's ever
your fault.

401
00:15:21,050 --> 00:15:23,653
Hey, at least I was willing
to work on our problems.

402
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:25,722
What, that stupid
Blueprint for Love?

403
00:15:25,788 --> 00:15:27,390
That was just an excuse
to try to change me.

404
00:15:27,457 --> 00:15:29,426
You knew who I was
when you moved in here.

405
00:15:29,492 --> 00:15:31,027
That doesn't mean
you can't grow.

406
00:15:31,094 --> 00:15:32,061
Why can't you grow?

407
00:15:32,129 --> 00:15:33,263
Because you hold me back!

408
00:15:33,330 --> 00:15:34,931
Stop it!

409
00:15:34,997 --> 00:15:38,268
Can't you see you're tearing
this family apart?

410
00:15:43,005 --> 00:15:45,342
Hah! What a couple
of 'mos.

411
00:15:46,643 --> 00:15:49,479
Look, can we at least establish
some ground rules

412
00:15:49,546 --> 00:15:51,714
about how we treat each other
in front of Jake?

413
00:15:51,781 --> 00:15:53,516
Like what?

414
00:15:53,583 --> 00:15:55,785
Like we agree that if there's
something's bothering us,

415
00:15:55,852 --> 00:15:57,554
we wait and discuss it
privately.
Fine.

416
00:15:57,620 --> 00:15:59,189
And no name-calling.
Done.

417
00:15:59,256 --> 00:16:00,157
And the sarcasm.

418
00:16:00,223 --> 00:16:01,358
While you and I know

419
00:16:01,424 --> 00:16:03,092
that our good-natured ribbing
is all in fun,

420
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:04,961
Jake might perceive it
as hostile.

421
00:16:05,027 --> 00:16:05,528
I hate you.

422
00:16:05,595 --> 00:16:07,364
Exactly.

423
00:16:07,430 --> 00:16:09,932
If Jake heard you say that,
he'd think you really meant it.

424
00:16:09,999 --> 00:16:11,934
I do mean it. I hate you.

425
00:16:12,001 --> 00:16:12,769
Funny.
One of those things

426
00:16:12,835 --> 00:16:14,137
I admire about you.

427
00:16:14,204 --> 00:16:15,905
Now, come on, we'll get
dressed and go talk to Jake.

428
00:16:15,972 --> 00:16:17,207
You know, I just thought

429
00:16:17,274 --> 00:16:18,675
of another thing
I'd change about you.

430
00:16:18,741 --> 00:16:20,076
Oh, yeah? What's that?

431
00:16:20,143 --> 00:16:22,279
Your inability
to accept my hatred.

432
00:16:23,246 --> 00:16:25,415

He still says he doesn't
want to spend the weekend
with you two.

436
00:16:33,990 --> 00:16:35,124
You heard her, Al.
Let's go.

437
00:16:35,192 --> 00:16:36,393
Oh, stop it.

438
00:16:36,459 --> 00:16:37,860
I'm serious.
We don't need him.

439
00:16:37,927 --> 00:16:40,697
I can pick my nose and
wipe it on your car seat.

440
00:16:40,763 --> 00:16:41,498
We'll talk to him.

441
00:16:41,564 --> 00:16:42,799
Where is he?
In his room.

442
00:16:44,634 --> 00:16:45,768
Let me ask you something.

443
00:16:45,835 --> 00:16:48,371
How did you convince Alan
you hated him?

444
00:16:48,438 --> 00:16:50,207
What?
He won't believe me.

445
00:16:50,273 --> 00:16:51,674
ALAN:
Charlie!

446
00:16:51,741 --> 00:16:54,311
It's not like I can
withhold sex, like you did.

450
00:17:02,885 --> 00:17:03,720
Wow.

451
00:17:03,786 --> 00:17:05,888
You are getting pretty good.

452
00:17:05,955 --> 00:17:08,758
I'm just tuning it.

453
00:17:08,825 --> 00:17:13,630
Well, tune on, broheim.

455
00:17:15,198 --> 00:17:16,566
Okay, first of all,

456
00:17:16,633 --> 00:17:19,436
your uncle and I
would like to apologize

457
00:17:19,502 --> 00:17:20,570
for our behavior last week.

458
00:17:20,637 --> 00:17:21,938
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

459
00:17:22,004 --> 00:17:24,641
I've got nothing
to apologize for.

460
00:17:24,707 --> 00:17:25,575
Oh, really? So you've
been just perfect

461
00:17:25,642 --> 00:17:26,776
through this whole thing?

462
00:17:26,843 --> 00:17:29,679
What can I tell you?
I'm a hummingbird.

463
00:17:29,746 --> 00:17:30,847
Shut up, Charlie.

464
00:17:30,913 --> 00:17:33,049
I hate you,
and you were adopted.

465
00:17:37,153 --> 00:17:38,855
Your uncle and
I understand

466
00:17:38,921 --> 00:17:40,790
that we might have
made you uncomfortable,

467
00:17:40,857 --> 00:17:43,293
and we want you to know

468
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:45,928
that we're going to make
a real effort to change.

469
00:17:45,995 --> 00:17:47,797
When are you planning to start?

470
00:17:47,864 --> 00:17:48,798
Right now.

471
00:17:48,865 --> 00:17:50,733
Right, Charlie?
Yeah, sure.

472
00:17:52,802 --> 00:17:54,737
Uh-huh.
And you won't embarrass
me in public anymore?

473
00:17:54,804 --> 00:17:56,573
When did we embarrass
you in public?

474
00:17:56,639 --> 00:17:58,608
Oh, come on,
you embarrass
him constantly.

475
00:17:58,675 --> 00:18:01,644
Uh, you don't?
Hey, I'm the
colorful uncle.

476
00:18:01,711 --> 00:18:03,346
One day, he'll be telling
his kids all kinds

477
00:18:03,413 --> 00:18:04,681
of funny stories about me.

478
00:18:04,747 --> 00:18:06,082
He'll be telling
stories about me, too.

479
00:18:06,148 --> 00:18:08,117
Yeah, to his court-appointed
psychiatrist.

480
00:18:09,852 --> 00:18:11,988
You know, you have got a cruel
streak that is just ugly.

481
00:18:12,054 --> 00:18:13,456
You want to know
what's just ugly?

482
00:18:13,523 --> 00:18:14,924
The schmuck who lives
in my guest room.

483
00:18:14,991 --> 00:18:17,560
At least I am not
an aging pretty boy

484
00:18:17,627 --> 00:18:20,196
desperately clinging on to
the last dregs of his youth.

485
00:18:20,263 --> 00:18:22,365
What are you saying,
I'm losing my looks?

486
00:18:23,766 --> 00:18:24,934
Oh, now you're worried.

487
00:18:25,001 --> 00:18:26,703
Let me tell you
something, pal.

488
00:18:26,769 --> 00:18:28,170
Looks is all
you've ever had.

489
00:18:28,237 --> 00:18:31,240
No heart, no soul, no depth
of character whatsoever.

490
00:18:31,308 --> 00:18:32,609
Come on, be honest.

491
00:18:32,675 --> 00:18:33,943
Which would you rather have?

492
00:18:34,010 --> 00:18:36,479
My looks or those
other three things?

493
00:18:36,546 --> 00:18:39,148
You know what?
Bite me!

494
00:18:39,215 --> 00:18:41,618
I can't believe
you actually bit me.

495
00:18:41,684 --> 00:18:43,553
Wait, wait!

496
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:44,987
I thought you were going
to talk to him.

497
00:18:45,054 --> 00:18:47,189
We did. He's still
kind of upset with us.

498
00:18:47,256 --> 00:18:48,190
You know teenagers.

499
00:18:48,257 --> 00:18:49,759
You just can't
reason with them.

500
00:18:49,826 --> 00:18:52,729
Oh, really?
Wait right here.

509
00:19:11,648 --> 00:19:13,383

give us the finger?

00:20:25,287 --> 00:20:26,322
Uh... Mom!

538
00:20:26,389 --> 00:20:27,123
We both have the same mother.

539
00:20:27,189 --> 00:20:28,425
No, no, no, no, no, no.

540
00:20:28,491 --> 00:20:29,659
You're adopted.

541
00:20:29,726 --> 00:20:33,596
Oh, right, right, right.

542
00:20:33,663 --> 00:20:35,031
Okay, let's see, let's see.

543
00:20:35,097 --> 00:20:36,733
Uh, what do we
have in common?

544
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:39,268
Uh... Oh, oh, oh!
Uh, here's one.

545
00:20:39,335 --> 00:20:41,771
Um, we both feel
unworthy of love

546
00:20:41,838 --> 00:20:44,574
and battle
homosexual panic.

547
00:20:51,714 --> 00:20:54,316
Maybe that's just me.

548
00:20:54,383 --> 00:20:56,318
Maybe.

549
00:20:56,385 --> 00:20:57,353
Mmm.

550
00:20:57,420 --> 00:20:59,656
Okay, okay,
here's one, here's one.

551
00:20:59,722 --> 00:21:01,691
Uh, we both love Jake.

552
00:21:01,758 --> 00:21:02,959
Oh, Jake.

553
00:21:03,025 --> 00:21:04,226
Mmm.

554
00:21:04,293 --> 00:21:05,995
Yeah, I love him.

555
00:21:06,062 --> 00:21:08,931
Where is the
little fartmeister?

556
00:21:08,998 --> 00:21:10,667
I think he's sleeping.

557
00:21:10,733 --> 00:21:13,503
Oh, he needs to
know we love him.

558
00:21:13,570 --> 00:21:15,438
You're right.
You're right.

559
00:21:15,505 --> 00:21:17,106
We don't tell him enough.

560
00:21:17,173 --> 00:21:20,643
Come on, let's go wake him
up and tell him we love him.

561
00:21:20,710 --> 00:21:25,014
Mmm, good idea, good idea.

562
00:21:25,081 --> 00:21:29,986
Jake!
Guess who loves you!
