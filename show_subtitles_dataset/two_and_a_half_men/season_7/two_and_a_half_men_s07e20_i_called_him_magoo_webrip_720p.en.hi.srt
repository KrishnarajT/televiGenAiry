you don't want

51

to spend some time
with your son?

52
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:54,061
I just did.

53
00:01:54,127 --> 00:01:55,863
Fair enough.

I got my boobs done?

through with them,

Yeah.

Yeah, well, I don't
want to hear you have sex!

71
00:02:40,507 --> 00:02:42,275

your headphones!

them for you!

358
00:16:32,438 --> 00:16:35,407
Whoa, that's going
to attract seagulls.

359
00:16:39,211 --> 00:16:42,281
Okay, let's get this over with.

360
00:16:42,348 --> 00:16:45,351
Don't you want to have some room
service champagne and oysters?

361
00:16:45,417 --> 00:16:47,353
No. I do this better
on an empty stomach.

362
00:16:47,419 --> 00:16:48,921
(TV turns off)

363
00:16:48,988 --> 00:16:51,858
By the way, um,
I'm a little foggy
from the Vicodin,

364
00:16:51,924 --> 00:16:53,993
so if I fall asleep
in the middle,

365
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:56,696
just give me a little
tap on the shoulder.

366
00:16:56,763 --> 00:16:58,230
Okay.

367
00:16:58,297 --> 00:16:59,932
Come here.

368
00:17:02,569 --> 00:17:04,403
You're a good
kisser, Alan.

369
00:17:04,470 --> 00:17:05,672
Thank you.

370
00:17:05,738 --> 00:17:07,640
Better than my ex-husband.

371
00:17:07,707 --> 00:17:11,578
Oh. Well, good for me.

372
00:17:11,644 --> 00:17:13,580
He made up for it

373
00:17:13,646 --> 00:17:15,782
below the waist,
if you know what I mean.

374
00:17:17,283 --> 00:17:19,418
He had big feet?

375
00:17:19,485 --> 00:17:20,620
Three of them.

376
00:17:20,687 --> 00:17:23,455
But only two wore shoes.

377
00:17:24,591 --> 00:17:26,525
Lucky you.

378
00:17:26,593 --> 00:17:28,194
Ah, don't worry.

379
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:30,229
Size doesn't matter to me.

380
00:17:30,296 --> 00:17:31,631
Good to know.

381
00:17:31,698 --> 00:17:34,333
In fact,
in this situation,

382
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,603
the smaller the better.

383
00:17:41,641 --> 00:17:44,744

384

386
00:17:54,086 --> 00:18:01,828
Um, I don't know.

Uh-oh.

What?

389
00:18:05,765 --> 00:18:07,533
I think the oysters
are making a break for it.

390
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,736
Excuse me.

391
00:18:10,703 --> 00:18:11,871
Are you going to throw up?

392
00:18:11,938 --> 00:18:13,039

Jake, get in here!

We have a kid?

416
00:19:07,994 --> 00:19:09,628
You didn't say anything
about having a kid.

He's not ours.
He's my brother's.

00:19:11,998 --> 00:19:15,067
So what's my part
in this scenario?

419
00:19:15,134 --> 00:19:18,537
You don't think I'm a good role
model, and yet, paradoxically,

you still want
to have children with me.

What?

422
00:19:23,109 --> 00:19:25,712
Did you go out even
though you were grounded?

423
00:19:25,778 --> 00:19:27,579
You told me to.

424
00:19:27,646 --> 00:19:31,083
Don't look at me
like that. He's lying.

All right, all right, enough.

You, young man,

429
00:19:37,857 --> 00:19:39,591
go to your room and think
about what you've done.

430
00:19:39,658 --> 00:19:41,761
Whatever.

431
00:19:42,962 --> 00:19:45,164
I think we handled
that really well.

How about you drag me
to some boring museum

439
00:20:00,346 --> 00:20:01,748

It's your money.

take a shower?

Well, sure.
Okay.
