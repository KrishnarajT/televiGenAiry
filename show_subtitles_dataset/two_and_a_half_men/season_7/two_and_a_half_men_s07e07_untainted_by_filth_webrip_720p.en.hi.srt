Hit me.

Uh, Chelsea, the way
it's supposed to work here

5
00:00:09,427 --> 00:00:11,362
is that Berta serves us dinner.

6
00:00:11,429 --> 00:00:12,463
I don't mind.

7
00:00:12,530 --> 00:00:14,165
Hear that? She doesn't mind.

8
00:00:14,232 --> 00:00:15,399
Shut up.

EVELYN:
We're back!

00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,169
Hey, how'd it go?

11
00:00:18,236 --> 00:00:19,837
I don't know
what you were worried about.

12
00:00:19,903 --> 00:00:21,472
Your son is a wonderful driver.

13
00:00:21,539 --> 00:00:22,840
Oh, well, thanks
for taking him, Mom.

14
00:00:22,906 --> 00:00:24,074
He needs the practice.

15
00:00:24,142 --> 00:00:26,977
Mmm, pork chops.

16
00:00:28,446 --> 00:00:30,381
What are you wearing?

17
00:00:30,448 --> 00:00:31,382
Grandma bought it for me.

18
00:00:31,449 --> 00:00:32,783
Pretty cool, huh?

19
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:35,119
You made him dress up
as a chauffeur?

20
00:00:35,186 --> 00:00:36,287
He loves it.

21
00:00:36,354 --> 00:00:38,622
Don't get grease on
that jacket, dear.

22
00:00:38,689 --> 00:00:40,191
Yes, Miss Evelyn.

23
00:00:41,325 --> 00:00:42,926
Would you like to join
us for dinner?

24
00:00:42,993 --> 00:00:44,928
Oh, no, thanks, I
had a late lunch.

25
00:00:44,995 --> 00:00:46,397
And she sent a piece of pie
out to the car,

26
00:00:46,464 --> 00:00:49,099
so I could eat, too.

27
00:00:49,167 --> 00:00:50,634
Anyway, I better
get going.

28
00:00:50,701 --> 00:00:51,669
Well, thanks again, Mom.

29
00:00:51,735 --> 00:00:52,703
Say thanks to Grandma.

30
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:54,305
Thank you, Miss Evelyn.

31
00:00:55,439 --> 00:00:57,341
Good to see you.
You, too.

32
00:00:57,408 --> 00:00:59,143
Oh, I almost forgot.

33
00:00:59,210 --> 00:01:01,312
Have you two set a
wedding date yet?

34
00:01:01,379 --> 00:01:03,614
No.

35
00:01:04,548 --> 00:01:06,517
We haven't.

36
00:01:06,584 --> 00:01:08,719
But we're gonna.

37
00:01:10,188 --> 00:01:13,123
Well, it just so happens
that a client of mine

38
00:01:13,191 --> 00:01:15,826
schedules the weddings
for the Bel Air Hotel,

39
00:01:15,893 --> 00:01:17,828
and she told me that
there was a cancellation

40
00:01:17,895 --> 00:01:19,663
for the weekend
of June 26.

41
00:01:19,730 --> 00:01:21,499
The Bel Air Hotel?
In June.

42
00:01:21,565 --> 00:01:23,501
Charlie, the Bel Air Hotel.

43
00:01:23,567 --> 00:01:25,135
In June.

44
00:01:25,203 --> 00:01:26,270
Yeah, I heard.

45
00:01:26,337 --> 00:01:27,505
Wow.

46
00:01:27,571 --> 00:01:28,672
What do ya think?

47
00:01:28,739 --> 00:01:30,374
Gee, I don't know.

48
00:01:30,441 --> 00:01:31,842
We hadn't talked about a date.

49
00:01:31,909 --> 00:01:33,177
Boy, it's almost impossible

50
00:01:33,244 --> 00:01:35,413
to get a June date
at the Bel Air Hotel.

51
00:01:35,479 --> 00:01:37,581
Thank you, Alan.

52
00:01:37,648 --> 00:01:39,417
Judith and I had to get married
at the Sportsmen's Lodge

53
00:01:39,483 --> 00:01:42,186
in November on the Wednesday
before Thanksgiving.

54
00:01:42,253 --> 00:01:45,956
Yes, I remember the Indian
corn centerpieces.

55
00:01:46,023 --> 00:01:48,959
Oh, Charlie, I've always
dreamed of getting married

56
00:01:49,026 --> 00:01:51,762
at the Bel Air in the garden
with the swans.

57
00:01:51,829 --> 00:01:55,599
Yeah, but keep in mind
those birds are vicious.

58
00:01:55,666 --> 00:01:58,602
They look pretty, but they'll
peck your eye right out.

59
00:01:58,669 --> 00:02:00,504
Besides, I thought if we
had the wedding here,

60
00:02:00,571 --> 00:02:04,107
the money we save could pay
for a nice long honeymoon.

61
00:02:04,174 --> 00:02:07,177
Yeah, I guess that's
probably smarter.

62
00:02:07,245 --> 00:02:08,379
Shame on you, Charles.

63
00:02:08,446 --> 00:02:11,148
Depriving your fiancée
of her dream wedding.

64
00:02:11,215 --> 00:02:13,217
Especially considering
all the money you blew

65
00:02:13,284 --> 00:02:16,019
on hooch and whores
over the years.

66
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,523
Thank you, Berta.

67
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:21,792
Tell you what—

68
00:02:21,859 --> 00:02:25,229
the wedding at the Bel Air
will be my gift to you.

69
00:02:25,296 --> 00:02:26,797
Are you serious?

70
00:02:26,864 --> 00:02:30,167
Gee, Mom, thanks, but that's
a little too generous.

71
00:02:30,234 --> 00:02:31,435
A little?
All she gave Judith and me

72
00:02:31,502 --> 00:02:32,803
was a dinette set.

73
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:35,072
Yes, and who's eating
on that dinette set now?

74
00:02:35,138 --> 00:02:36,474
That's not the point.

75
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:39,310
Charlie's marriage is just
as likely to fail as mine was.

76
00:02:39,377 --> 00:02:40,878
Thanks again, bro.

77
00:02:40,944 --> 00:02:42,079
Anyway,

78
00:02:42,145 --> 00:02:44,014
I asked them to hold the date
for 24 hours.

79
00:02:44,081 --> 00:02:46,049
So you can talk it over
and decide.

80
00:02:46,116 --> 00:02:48,118
Thank you, Evelyn.
That is so sweet.

81
00:02:48,185 --> 00:02:50,288
Well, I do have
an ulterior motive.

82
00:02:50,354 --> 00:02:51,955
The sooner you two get married,

83
00:02:52,022 --> 00:02:53,223
the sooner I'll have
more grandchildren.

84
00:02:53,291 --> 00:02:55,225
Why? Does Miss Evelyn
need a cook

85
00:02:55,293 --> 00:02:56,794
and a butler, too?

86
00:02:59,229 --> 00:03:00,398
Let me know, dear.

87
00:03:00,464 --> 00:03:02,400
I will.

88
00:03:02,466 --> 00:03:04,435
The Bel Air Hotel.

89
00:03:04,502 --> 00:03:05,903
In June.

90
00:03:07,305 --> 00:03:09,807
Let's see ya get out
of this one, Houdini.

your mother's offer?

95
00:03:23,587 --> 00:03:25,723
Yeah, I have.

96
00:03:25,789 --> 00:03:28,592
I've got one question.

97
00:03:28,659 --> 00:03:30,227
Why June?

98
00:03:30,294 --> 00:03:32,229
What's wrong with getting
married in July?

99
00:03:32,296 --> 00:03:33,964
Or the following October?

100
00:03:35,333 --> 00:03:37,835
October is a perfectly
good month.

101
00:03:37,901 --> 00:03:39,303
Birds all fly south,

102
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:42,940
so you don't have to worry
about swan attacks.

103
00:03:43,006 --> 00:03:45,242
Charlie, if you don't want
to get married in June,

104
00:03:45,309 --> 00:03:46,444
we don't have to.

105
00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:47,545
What? No, no.

106
00:03:47,611 --> 00:03:49,747
No, that's not what
I'm saying at all.

107
00:03:49,813 --> 00:03:52,282
Where do you get
this stuff?

108
00:03:53,384 --> 00:03:54,885
So?

109
00:03:54,952 --> 00:03:56,053
So, what?

110
00:03:56,119 --> 00:03:59,323
Do you want to get
married in June?

111
00:03:59,390 --> 00:04:02,292
Oh, we're back on that.

112
00:04:03,761 --> 00:04:07,898
Well, I can't think of
any good reason why not.

113
00:04:07,965 --> 00:04:10,901
And believe me,
I'm trying.

114
00:04:10,968 --> 00:04:12,536
So that's it?

115
00:04:12,603 --> 00:04:15,706
We're getting married June 26
at the Bel Air Hotel?

116
00:04:15,773 --> 00:04:17,941
I guess so.

117
00:04:18,008 --> 00:04:20,544
Oh, Charlie, I'm so happy.

118
00:04:20,611 --> 00:04:22,746
That's only because
you don't have a swan beak

119
00:04:22,813 --> 00:04:25,215
in your eye socket yet.

120
00:04:25,282 --> 00:04:26,850
I'm going to go
call your mom,

121
00:04:26,917 --> 00:04:28,952
and then my mom and
then all my friends.

122
00:04:29,019 --> 00:04:30,354
Good, good.

123
00:04:30,421 --> 00:04:31,522
Alan, we're going to do it.

124
00:04:31,589 --> 00:04:33,323
June 26 at the
Bel Air Hotel.

125
00:04:33,391 --> 00:04:35,292
(squealing): Oh, my God!
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

126
00:04:35,359 --> 00:04:37,528
That's so wonderful!

127
00:04:37,595 --> 00:04:39,296
I know! I gotta go
call everybody.

128
00:04:41,198 --> 00:04:44,134
Congratulations.

129
00:04:44,201 --> 00:04:45,803
Thanks.

130
00:04:45,869 --> 00:04:48,171
Wow, the end of an era.

131
00:04:48,238 --> 00:04:50,207
Guess so.

132
00:04:50,273 --> 00:04:52,410
Well, you had a good run.

133
00:04:53,511 --> 00:04:54,912
Yep.

134
00:04:54,978 --> 00:04:57,347
But now it's over.

135
00:04:57,415 --> 00:05:00,283
(whispering):
Forever.

136
00:05:01,218 --> 00:05:03,587
Nothing's going to change, Alan.

137
00:05:03,654 --> 00:05:05,155
Sure, I'm going to be married,

138
00:05:05,222 --> 00:05:06,824
but I'm still going
to be the same guy

139
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:08,559
living in the same house
with the same woman.

140
00:05:08,626 --> 00:05:10,561
Yes, yes, the same woman.

141
00:05:10,628 --> 00:05:12,763
(whispering):
Forever.

142
00:05:13,764 --> 00:05:16,400
Hey, can I be
the best man?

143
00:05:16,467 --> 00:05:18,602
You'll need a sex change.

144
00:05:20,771 --> 00:05:21,772
Where you going?

145
00:05:21,839 --> 00:05:22,906
Out for a drink.

146
00:05:22,973 --> 00:05:24,341
You can drink here.

147
00:05:24,408 --> 00:05:26,477
I could, but I don't
want to vomit here.

148
00:05:26,544 --> 00:05:29,379
Wait, wait, wait,
I'll go with you.

149
00:05:29,447 --> 00:05:31,615
Why?
I'm not done poking at you.

150
00:05:31,682 --> 00:05:35,185
Hey, shouldn't you ask the
ol' ball and chain first?

151
00:05:35,252 --> 00:05:36,787
I don't need her permission.

152
00:05:36,854 --> 00:05:39,289
Really?
Yes, really.

153
00:05:41,925 --> 00:05:44,528
Although, it is considerate

154
00:05:44,595 --> 00:05:47,030
to let your partner
know your plans,

155
00:05:47,097 --> 00:05:48,832
so she won't worry.

156
00:05:48,899 --> 00:05:51,201
Sweetie, I'm going out
for a drink with Alan, okay?

157
00:05:51,268 --> 00:05:52,803
CHELSEA:
Sure! Have fun!

158
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:55,639
Thanks! Love you!

159
00:05:57,708 --> 00:05:59,743
Shut up.

160
00:06:01,845 --> 00:06:02,813
You're driving.

161
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:05,382
Wow.

162
00:06:05,449 --> 00:06:08,586
Jake has one big-ass head.

163
00:06:08,652 --> 00:06:10,387
♪ Men. ♪

164
00:06:10,454 --> 00:06:12,556
All kidding aside,
she's a great girl

165

and I'm sure you're going
to be very happy.

166
00:06:14,725 --> 00:06:15,493
Thanks.

167
00:06:15,559 --> 00:06:18,696

168
00:06:18,762 --> 00:06:20,764
Are you done poking?

169
00:06:20,831 --> 00:06:22,566
For the moment.

170
00:06:22,633 --> 00:06:24,802
Boy, who would've figured
that of the two of us

171
00:06:24,868 --> 00:06:26,837
I'd end up being the
carefree bachelor?

172
00:06:26,904 --> 00:06:30,307
If by carefree,
you mean broke and lonely,

173
00:06:30,373 --> 00:06:32,510
everybody would've figured.

174
00:06:34,612 --> 00:06:35,546
Hi.

175
00:06:35,613 --> 00:06:36,880
Hi.

176

Charlie.
Betsy.

177
00:06:39,182 --> 00:06:41,652
I'm getting married
on June 26.

178
00:06:41,719 --> 00:06:43,153
Good for you.

179
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:44,788
At the Bel Air Hotel.

180
00:06:44,855 --> 00:06:47,491
Nice!

181
00:06:47,558 --> 00:06:49,960
That means no matter

Let me tell you a story.

463
00:18:54,884 --> 00:18:58,588
Many years ago,

464
00:18:58,655 --> 00:18:59,889
The carpet king?

465
00:18:59,956 --> 00:19:01,891
Well, I called him that.

466
00:19:01,958 --> 00:19:05,595
Wasn't his occupation.

467
00:19:05,662 --> 00:19:07,730
Anyway,
he was away on business,

468
00:19:07,797 --> 00:19:11,734
and you and your brother were
in summer camp or somewhere,

469
00:19:11,801 --> 00:19:13,936
and I...

470
00:19:14,003 --> 00:19:17,340
Well, I was lonely, bored

471
00:19:17,407 --> 00:19:19,542
and the circus was in town.

472
00:19:21,711 --> 00:19:24,447
And when I woke up
in that Motel 6,

473
00:19:24,514 --> 00:19:27,950
clown makeup smeared
all over my bosom,

474
00:19:28,017 --> 00:19:29,218

476
00:19:30,887 --> 00:19:33,923

had moved on to the next town.

477
00:19:33,990 --> 00:19:36,293
Oh, my God!

478
00:19:37,294 --> 00:19:38,428

from my hoo-hoo...
