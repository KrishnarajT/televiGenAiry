182
00:07:19,232 --> 00:07:21,401
Good.

183
00:07:24,037 --> 00:07:25,973
Or bad.

184
00:07:28,275 --> 00:07:31,579
Probably bad.

185
00:07:31,645 --> 00:07:34,181
I'm gonna go with bad.

186
00:07:34,247 --> 00:07:36,149
♪ Men.

187
00:07:38,518 --> 00:07:39,953
Hi, Charlie!

188
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:41,288
We were just having a little

189
00:07:41,354 --> 00:07:43,123
moonlight skinny dip
in the ocean.

190
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:44,424
Good thinking.

191
00:07:44,491 --> 00:07:46,193
Nothing more romantic
than seaweed

192
00:07:46,259 --> 00:07:48,195
hanging from a cold,
shriveled penis.

193
00:07:48,261 --> 00:07:50,598
There's no seaweed—

194
00:07:50,664 --> 00:07:52,600
Oh, my...

195
00:07:55,302 --> 00:07:56,937
Don't put it on the table!

196
00:07:57,004 --> 00:07:59,072
Sorry.

197
00:07:59,139 --> 00:08:01,809
Alan, what do you say
we take a hot shower

198
00:08:01,875 --> 00:08:04,745
and un-shrink the
Snuffleupagus?
(chuckles)

199
00:08:04,812 --> 00:08:06,213
He'll be fine.

200
00:08:06,279 --> 00:08:08,315
It's Bert and Ernie
I'm worried about.

201
00:08:08,381 --> 00:08:10,417
I think Bert has ascended
to my rib cage.

202
00:08:10,483 --> 00:08:12,152
You go ahead.
I'll be right there.

203
00:08:12,219 --> 00:08:13,486
Okey-doke.
Okay.

204
00:08:16,323 --> 00:08:18,491
Hey, uh, can I
ask you something?

205
00:08:18,558 --> 00:08:21,261
I am not gonna help you
find your missing testicle.

206
00:08:21,328 --> 00:08:23,163
No, no, it's about Melissa.

207
00:08:23,230 --> 00:08:24,564
What about her?

208
00:08:24,632 --> 00:08:26,767
Well, now that we're
seeing each other again,

209
00:08:26,834 --> 00:08:27,968
the fact that she still
lives with her mom

210
00:08:28,035 --> 00:08:29,002
presents kind of a problem.

211
00:08:29,069 --> 00:08:30,070
Why?

212
00:08:30,137 --> 00:08:33,040
'Cause you tickled mom's Elmo?

213
00:08:33,106 --> 00:08:35,208
It was just light necking.

214
00:08:35,275 --> 00:08:37,077
I never touched her Elmo.

215
00:08:37,144 --> 00:08:38,445
Anyway,

216
00:08:38,511 --> 00:08:39,780
since you set the precedent

217
00:08:39,847 --> 00:08:41,314
of having girlfriends
move in here,

218
00:08:41,381 --> 00:08:41,715
uh, I was wondering
if maybe...

219
00:08:41,782 --> 00:08:42,816
No.

220
00:08:42,883 --> 00:08:45,118
Why not?

221
00:08:45,185 --> 00:08:46,386
You let Chelsea move in.

222
00:08:46,453 --> 00:08:48,055
It's my house.

223
00:08:48,121 --> 00:08:49,723
You are a guest.

224
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:53,026
And by "guest," I mean leech I
tolerate until our mother dies

225
00:08:53,093 --> 00:08:55,028
and she can't lay
a guilt trip on me

226
00:08:55,095 --> 00:08:56,730
for kicking your
ass to the curb.

227
00:08:56,797 --> 00:08:58,331
You're gonna kick me out
when Mom dies?

228
00:08:58,398 --> 00:09:00,834
You're planning on being
here until Mom dies?

229
00:09:00,901 --> 00:09:03,003
Okay, okay,
we're getting off subject.

230
00:09:03,070 --> 00:09:04,972
What about Jake?
You let Jake move in.

231
00:09:05,038 --> 00:09:06,239
You're not helping
your case here, Alan.

232
00:09:06,306 --> 00:09:06,940

00:09:07,007 --> 00:09:08,141

was a practical joke.

00:13:38,145 --> 00:13:40,447
Well, it's been pretty slow,

331
00:13:40,513 --> 00:13:42,049
but thankfully,
the house is paid off,

332
00:13:42,115 --> 00:13:45,318
my pension is funded,
and I've given up prostitutes.

333

a couple grand a month?

335
00:13:49,322 --> 00:13:51,258

336
00:13:51,324 --> 00:13:53,826

337
00:13:53,893 --> 00:13:55,162

338
00:13:55,228 --> 00:13:56,663
Wow, you remember.

339
00:13:56,729 --> 00:14:00,200
I'm not sitting here
sketching ponies, Charlie.

340
00:14:01,935 --> 00:14:03,870
Anyway, I ran into her.

341
00:14:03,937 --> 00:14:05,472
Really? And how'd that go?

342
00:14:05,538 --> 00:14:07,607
Fine, fine. She looks great,

343
00:14:07,674 --> 00:14:09,876
she's single again,
told me she missed me.

344
00:14:09,943 --> 00:14:10,510
Uh-huh.

345
00:14:10,577 --> 00:14:12,012
I always dig that.

346
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:15,415
Then she asked me
if I could help her out

347
00:14:15,482 --> 00:14:17,584
with this music project,
and I said no.

348
00:14:17,650 --> 00:14:19,252
But then Chelsea said

349
00:14:19,319 --> 00:14:22,022
if I didn't still have feelings
for her, why not do it?

350
00:14:22,089 --> 00:14:23,090
So I did it.

351
00:14:23,156 --> 00:14:23,991
Interesting.

352
00:14:24,057 --> 00:14:25,492
When did all this happen?

353
00:14:25,558 --> 00:14:26,826
Three of four days ago.

354
00:14:26,893 --> 00:14:30,263
And how long have you
been constipated?

355
00:14:30,330 --> 00:14:32,599
I don't know.
Three, four days.

356
00:14:34,034 --> 00:14:37,104
Hey, you think
there's a connection?

357
00:14:37,170 --> 00:14:38,605
I'm leaning that way.

358
00:14:38,671 --> 00:14:39,939
Look, Charlie,

359

and yet you're committed
to Chelsea.

361
00:14:43,810 --> 00:14:45,112
It's an emotional conflict,

362
00:14:45,178 --> 00:14:46,779

that conflict,

363

to resolve the conflict

370

because my emotions
are strongly connected

371
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:11,704

372
00:15:11,771 --> 00:15:13,740

388
00:15:51,211 --> 00:15:53,480

your conflict?

389
00:15:53,546 --> 00:15:54,981
I'm not sure.

390
00:15:55,048 --> 00:15:56,716
I may have to sleep with Mia.

00:15:56,783 --> 00:15:58,351
