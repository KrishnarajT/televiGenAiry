1
00:00:01,358 --> 00:00:02,928
This is where I sit.

2
00:00:02,929 --> 00:00:05,330
Right on. Good location.

3
00:00:06,133 --> 00:00:07,287
What else?

4
00:00:07,288 --> 00:00:09,690
That's the sink.

5
00:00:09,723 --> 00:00:12,255
If you put your thumb over the hole,
you can squirt water

6
00:00:12,256 --> 00:00:15,460
all the way over to the other side
of the room.

7
00:00:15,461 --> 00:00:16,743
Cool.

8
00:00:16,744 --> 00:00:20,172
I'm not allowed to use the sink anymore.

9
00:00:20,173 --> 00:00:22,319
Got it.

10
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:28,602
- So, what's the deal with your teacher?
- Miss Tuttle? She's very strict.

11
00:00:28,603 --> 00:00:31,004
That could work.

12
00:00:31,552 --> 00:00:33,410
Did you see this drawing our son made?

13
00:00:33,411 --> 00:00:36,135
It's a cry for his parents
to get back together.

14
00:00:36,136 --> 00:00:39,116
Alan, it's Davy Crockett at the Alamo.

15
00:00:39,117 --> 00:00:42,470
I know. Breaks your heart, doesn't it?

16
00:00:42,931 --> 00:00:44,629
I can see you got your brother here.

17
00:00:44,630 --> 00:00:48,090
Yeah, he wasn't thrilled about it,
but he can't say no to Jake.

18
00:00:48,091 --> 00:00:51,521
And I kind of implied that Miss Tuttle
was a bit of a freak.

19
00:00:51,522 --> 00:00:52,738
Excuse me?

20
00:00:52,739 --> 00:00:56,937
You wanted me to get him here.
He's here. The rest is up to you.

21
00:00:56,938 --> 00:00:59,053
So, come on. You gonna introduce me?

22
00:00:59,054 --> 00:01:01,457
- What for?
- She's your teacher.

23
00:01:01,458 --> 00:01:05,560
You're my nephew. I feel like...
Come on, just do it.

24
00:01:05,561 --> 00:01:08,188
Don't you want to see my model
of a California mission?

25
00:01:08,189 --> 00:01:10,432
- It's made of sugar cubes.
- Okay.

26
00:01:10,433 --> 00:01:13,027
First your mission, then mine.

27
00:01:13,606 --> 00:01:16,458
May I have everyone's attention? Hello.

28
00:01:16,459 --> 00:01:19,380
I'm Judith Harper, the class mom.

29
00:01:23,286 --> 00:01:26,779
I just want to thank you all for coming.
This is a great turnout.

30
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:29,182
Give yourselves a hand.

31
00:01:33,223 --> 00:01:35,947
I understand you teachers
are sadly underpaid.

32
00:01:35,948 --> 00:01:37,933
That's very true.

33
00:01:37,934 --> 00:01:42,094
I'd like to do my part.
Can I buy you dinner?

34
00:01:42,487 --> 00:01:44,954
So please feel free to put your name
on the sign-up sheets

35
00:01:44,955 --> 00:01:48,062
if you're available
for carpools, coaching, fieldtrips.

36
00:01:48,063 --> 00:01:49,505
Charlie Harper.

37
00:01:49,506 --> 00:01:53,157
Jake's uncle, mentor, pal.

38
00:01:59,442 --> 00:02:02,038
And finally, and this is a biggie, folks.

39
00:02:02,039 --> 00:02:04,153
It looks as if we're gonna have to cancel

40
00:02:04,154 --> 00:02:07,840
our annual music show
for our fourth graders.

41
00:02:07,841 --> 00:02:12,135
Unless someone with music experience
volunteers to help us out.

42
00:02:12,136 --> 00:02:14,693
Anyone? Anyone at all?

43
00:02:15,822 --> 00:02:17,776
- Charlie?
- Yeah.

44
00:02:17,777 --> 00:02:20,832
Thank you. Charlie Harper, everyone.

45
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:30,212
What?

46
00:02:42,359 --> 00:02:44,339
Go ahead, say it.

47
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:47,085
You traitorous, rat bastard.

48
00:02:47,182 --> 00:02:50,210
Good. You feel better?

49
00:02:51,016 --> 00:02:54,018
You set me up. You lured me
into that classroom

50
00:02:54,019 --> 00:02:56,509
with promises of donuts
and loose women.

51
00:02:56,510 --> 00:03:00,789
I'm sorry. I honestly thought
there'd be donuts.

52
00:03:01,078 --> 00:03:03,824
What about Miss Tuttle? The freak?

53
00:03:03,825 --> 00:03:06,994
She's a married Christian missionary!

54
00:03:07,467 --> 00:03:10,810
Okay, that I just lied about.

55
00:03:11,364 --> 00:03:13,983
But it was for a good cause.
The kids really need you.

56
00:03:13,984 --> 00:03:17,082
Yeah, but see, here's the problem.
I don't like kids.

57
00:03:17,083 --> 00:03:20,755
- You like Jake.
- Jake's different. He's cool. He's our kid.

58
00:03:20,756 --> 00:03:23,150
The rest of them.

59
00:03:24,301 --> 00:03:28,073
- What other kids do you know?
- I see them.

60
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:30,561
Having tantrums in supermarkets,

61
00:03:30,562 --> 00:03:35,158
screaming in movie theaters,
making everything sticky.

62
00:03:36,759 --> 00:03:40,752
And the whole world gives them
a free ride just because they're cute.

63
00:03:40,753 --> 00:03:43,627
Okay. Forget about the kids.
Do this for me and Judith.

64
00:03:43,628 --> 00:03:45,959
Not really a big Judith fan, either.

65
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,940
Come on. You'll write the music and lyrics.

66
00:03:47,941 --> 00:03:51,964
Judith and l
will produce and direct. Together.

67
00:03:51,965 --> 00:03:54,137
Hold on.

68
00:03:54,138 --> 00:03:56,660
So you roped me into this
because you think

69
00:03:56,661 --> 00:03:59,631
that the three of us collaborating
on a fourth-grade tribute

70
00:03:59,632 --> 00:04:03,368
to the lndustrial Revolution will somehow
lead to you getting back together

71
00:04:03,369 --> 00:04:06,155
with your allegedly gay ex-wife?

72
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:10,939
It's easy to make anything
sound stupid, Charlie.

73
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:14,581
Look, we're still legally married.
Frankly, I don't buy the whole gay thing.

74
00:04:14,582 --> 00:04:21,245
A gay woman would not fake orgasms
for 12 years just to protect my feelings.

75
00:04:21,737 --> 00:04:24,370
Okay. Take off your seat belt.

76
00:04:24,453 --> 00:04:26,432
- Why?
- Because when I slam on the brakes,

77
00:04:26,433 --> 00:04:30,042
I want to watch you
go through the windshield.

78
00:04:30,043 --> 00:04:33,236
Don't be silly. Do you know how fast
you'd have to be going to...

79
00:04:33,237 --> 00:04:35,631
Hey, slow down.

80
00:04:37,901 --> 00:04:40,945
Manpower, horsepower, coal and steam

81
00:04:41,095 --> 00:04:43,910
Moving forward the American dream

82
00:04:44,193 --> 00:04:47,058
Electric, atomic, solar, too

83
00:04:47,165 --> 00:04:50,323
All this energy for me and you

84
00:04:53,521 --> 00:04:57,418
- I want to like it.
- Yeah, want to like it.

85
00:04:59,175 --> 00:05:01,922
- But?
- But I just don't think it's your best work.

86
00:05:01,923 --> 00:05:04,316
It's not. Fire me, please.

87
00:05:04,638 --> 00:05:07,672
Do you remember that show
that you and I did in college?

88
00:05:07,673 --> 00:05:09,524
Stormy Weather? Sure.

89
00:05:09,525 --> 00:05:11,665
- Now, those songs had a point of view.
- Yeah.

90
00:05:11,666 --> 00:05:13,869
And you couldn't get them
out of your head.

91
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:17,028
Co-ed bathrooms, co-ed bathrooms

92
00:05:17,096 --> 00:05:20,609
Wear your flip-flops
in the co-ed bathrooms

93
00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:23,604
Stuff grows on the floor there

94
00:05:23,709 --> 00:05:27,002
And whoops! There's another pubic hair

95
00:05:30,097 --> 00:05:33,611
See? Maybe the easiest way to do this
is for us to write the actual song.

96
00:05:33,612 --> 00:05:36,805
Yeah. Then Charlie could just toss in
the specific notes and stuff.

97
00:05:36,806 --> 00:05:39,668
Yeah, Charlie, what do you think?

98
00:05:40,416 --> 00:05:43,833
Okay, then I guess it's just the two of us.

99
00:05:43,834 --> 00:05:49,252
- Like the old days.
- Yeah. Except this time I'm not a virgin.

100
00:05:51,085 --> 00:05:54,278
How come you're not
helping Mom and Dad with the show?

101
00:05:54,279 --> 00:05:55,971
How can I put this?

102
00:05:55,972 --> 00:06:00,124
Your uncle Charlie is a professional
musician, and your mom and dad...

103
00:06:00,125 --> 00:06:02,518
Suck?

104
00:06:05,395 --> 00:06:07,789
Good a word as any.

105
00:06:09,613 --> 00:06:11,848
I think they're gonna get back together.

106
00:06:11,849 --> 00:06:13,061
- You do?
- Yep.

107
00:06:13,062 --> 00:06:15,521
Except if my Dad moves back
to Mom's house,

108
00:06:15,522 --> 00:06:17,310
I probably wouldn't see you anymore.

109
00:06:17,311 --> 00:06:21,080
Of course you'd see me. You'd still have
your room here, and I'd come visit.

110
00:06:21,081 --> 00:06:24,658
- You never visited before.
- That's 'cause I didn't know you before.

111
00:06:24,659 --> 00:06:27,444
That's 'cause you never visited.

112
00:06:27,852 --> 00:06:30,246
Gin.

113
00:06:30,983 --> 00:06:34,400
To tell you the truth, Jake,
I don't think this is gonna be an issue.

114
00:06:34,401 --> 00:06:36,605
You don't think they're gonna
get back together?

115
00:06:36,606 --> 00:06:39,210
- I didn't say that.
- Do you?

116
00:06:39,289 --> 00:06:41,268
- Hey, what do I know?
- I think they are.

117
00:06:41,269 --> 00:06:43,882
Robert Fulton, Eli Whitney

118
00:06:43,952 --> 00:06:46,370
Robert Fulton, Eli Whitney

119
00:06:46,476 --> 00:06:50,015
All aboard for Henry Ford

120
00:06:54,174 --> 00:06:55,291
Henry Ford

121
00:06:55,292 --> 00:06:56,378
And then...

122
00:06:56,379 --> 00:06:59,088
Careful what you wish for, pal.

123
00:07:01,936 --> 00:07:05,661
Charlie, we're gonna be late for rehearsal.

124
00:07:08,230 --> 00:07:11,327
- What are you doing?
- Making margaritas.

125
00:07:11,328 --> 00:07:13,659
But we've got a rehearsal at Jake's school.

126
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:16,111
Don't worry, I have a plan.

127
00:07:18,101 --> 00:07:20,655
Charlie, you're taking liquor
to Jake's school?

128
00:07:20,656 --> 00:07:22,796
You betcha.

129
00:07:22,797 --> 00:07:27,683
I'm not gonna face all those pre-pubers
without a snootful.

130
00:07:27,684 --> 00:07:30,814
They'll have limes
in the teacher's lounge, right?

131
00:07:30,814 --> 00:07:34,551
No. There's no limes,
there's no swizzle sticks, there's...

132
00:07:34,552 --> 00:07:36,945
- Oh, God.
- What?

133
00:07:37,363 --> 00:07:39,279
It's from Judith's lawyers.

134
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:41,673
Really? Good news?

135
00:07:42,921 --> 00:07:47,232
No, it's not good news.
Judith filed for divorce.

136
00:07:47,233 --> 00:07:49,651
Man. I'm sorry.

137
00:07:50,556 --> 00:07:52,919
What am I gonna do?

138
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:55,634
There's a lot of ways to respond
to something like this.

139
00:07:55,635 --> 00:07:58,029
Anger, grief, denial.

140
00:07:58,510 --> 00:08:00,298
What would you do?

141
00:08:00,299 --> 00:08:06,205
I'd probably blow off rehearsal
and start chugging from the blender.

142
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:10,721
But I wouldn't recommend that
for an amateur.

143
00:08:13,076 --> 00:08:15,535
I can't believe she blind-sided me like this.

144
00:08:15,536 --> 00:08:18,474
Being so nice and friendly to my face.

145
00:08:18,475 --> 00:08:21,349
Meanwhile her lawyers were working
behind my face.

146
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:22,946
Let me tell you something, Charlie.

147
00:08:22,947 --> 00:08:25,758
A woman who would do such a thing
cannot be trusted.

148
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:28,888
Yeah, well, maybe you can use
this divorce as a chance to

149
00:08:28,889 --> 00:08:31,635
take a little break from each other.

150
00:08:31,636 --> 00:08:35,085
No, that would be playing
right into her hands.

151
00:08:35,086 --> 00:08:39,014
Alan, your kid's confused enough about
you and his mother. Don't make it worse.

152
00:08:39,015 --> 00:08:42,433
How could I possibly make it any worse?

153
00:08:43,136 --> 00:08:45,052
Let's find out.

154
00:08:45,053 --> 00:08:48,374
Okay, everybody, what we're gonna do
is put the girls on one side

155
00:08:48,375 --> 00:08:49,971
- and the boys on the other.
- Sure.

156
00:08:49,972 --> 00:08:53,964
Start splitting them up early.
That's your answer for everything, isn't it?

157
00:08:53,965 --> 00:08:55,210
Excuse me?

158
00:08:55,211 --> 00:09:00,563
Would Mrs. Plaintiff please see
Mr. Respondent in the hallway?

159
00:09:01,919 --> 00:09:05,107
Watch the kids, we'll be right back.

160
00:09:05,433 --> 00:09:07,826
Wait!

161
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:14,023
Jake? Where's Jake?

162
00:09:26,292 --> 00:09:28,743
Okay. Everybody take five.

163
00:09:30,573 --> 00:09:32,967
That means sit down.

164
00:09:35,428 --> 00:09:37,822
Stand up.

165
00:09:38,974 --> 00:09:41,368
Hop up and down.

166
00:09:42,839 --> 00:09:45,233
Right on.

167
00:09:45,747 --> 00:09:48,716
But why file for divorce?
We were getting along so well.

168
00:09:48,717 --> 00:09:51,336
We've been getting along
because I don't feel trapped,

169
00:09:51,337 --> 00:09:53,412
suffocated and depressed anymore.

170
00:09:53,413 --> 00:09:57,875
Sure, kick me out,
then work on improving yourself.

171
00:09:59,419 --> 00:10:03,449
Okay. Everybody flap your arms
like a chicken.

172
00:10:07,724 --> 00:10:11,726
Alan, check it out.
I got this amazing power.

173
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:14,973
Stop.

174
00:10:16,829 --> 00:10:19,940
It's like having my own robot army.

175
00:10:23,984 --> 00:10:26,617
No, wait, where are you going?

176
00:10:29,127 --> 00:10:32,192
- Are we gonna do our songs?
- Hey, I'm just the piano player.

177
00:10:32,193 --> 00:10:34,939
Lerner and Lowe are out in the hallway
working things out.

178
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:37,271
- Who?
- Lerner and Lowe?

179
00:10:37,272 --> 00:10:39,666
My Fair Lady? Camelot?

180
00:10:40,211 --> 00:10:42,968
Aren't there any gay kids here?

181
00:10:46,057 --> 00:10:49,251
- They're fighting again, aren't they?
- Yeah, what can I tell you.

182
00:10:49,252 --> 00:10:51,997
Your Mom lawyered up
and your Dad is freaking out.

183
00:10:51,998 --> 00:10:54,489
Stay cool, I'll try to get them back in here.

184
00:10:54,490 --> 00:10:59,306
Hey, everybody, Jake's in charge.
So, whatever he says.

185
00:11:02,029 --> 00:11:04,610
Okay, it's been fun.

186
00:11:04,712 --> 00:11:07,682
But I'm officially resigning
as the Mayor of Booger Town.

187
00:11:07,683 --> 00:11:09,376
Not now, Charlie.

188
00:11:09,376 --> 00:11:12,633
You know, I have tried everything I can
to make you happy.

189
00:11:12,634 --> 00:11:16,467
I don't want to rush you or anything,
but have you ever read Lord of the Flies?

190
00:11:16,468 --> 00:11:18,703
But you know what? You know what?
I'm through.

191
00:11:18,704 --> 00:11:21,035
Maybe your lawyers can make you happy.

192
00:11:21,036 --> 00:11:23,640
Your brother's a horse's ass.

193
00:11:23,974 --> 00:11:28,414
Hey, let's not lose sight of who
the real victim of this divorce is.

194
00:11:28,415 --> 00:11:30,808
Me!

195
00:11:40,043 --> 00:11:44,131
Okay, I think we should all calm down
just a little.

196
00:11:44,132 --> 00:11:48,027
You're not our teacher.
Why should we listen to you?

197
00:11:48,028 --> 00:11:50,200
Okay, let me put it another way.

198
00:11:50,201 --> 00:11:52,594
Shut up and sit down!

199
00:11:56,973 --> 00:11:58,857
Thanks.

200
00:11:58,858 --> 00:12:01,859
Now, listen, rehearsal's over.
You can all go home.

201
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:03,808
What about our play?

202
00:12:03,809 --> 00:12:06,395
You know how they say,
"The show must go on"?

203
00:12:06,396 --> 00:12:09,613
They weren't talking about this show.

204
00:12:10,102 --> 00:12:13,295
- Your uncle's so lame.
- ls not. He's cool.

205
00:12:13,296 --> 00:12:15,020
- Yeah, right.
- He is.

206
00:12:15,021 --> 00:12:17,417
He's almost famous.
He wrote the Maple Loops song.

207
00:12:17,417 --> 00:12:19,811
- Did not.
- Did, too!

208
00:12:20,963 --> 00:12:24,955
- Prove it.
- You see that Jaguar in the parking lot?

209
00:12:24,956 --> 00:12:27,287
Maple Loops.

210
00:12:27,288 --> 00:12:29,720
That doesn't prove anything.

211
00:12:30,994 --> 00:12:33,387
Fine.

212
00:12:36,264 --> 00:12:39,771
It's got oats and corns and wheat

213
00:12:39,873 --> 00:12:44,459
It's the sweetest breakfast treat
It's maple-licious

214
00:12:47,061 --> 00:12:50,765
- Everybody knows that?
- Of course. It's the Maple Loops song.

215
00:12:50,766 --> 00:12:55,486
- Uncle Charlie, do Fudge Nuggets.
- Yeah! Fudge Nuggets!

216
00:12:56,038 --> 00:12:58,902
From the magic chocolate mountain

217
00:12:58,977 --> 00:13:01,211
In a secret chocolate mine

218
00:13:01,212 --> 00:13:03,384
Come granny's big fudge nuggets

219
00:13:03,384 --> 00:13:07,534
With a taste that's oh so fine

220
00:13:11,339 --> 00:13:15,159
What do you know.
Maybe I don't hate kids.

221
00:13:24,596 --> 00:13:25,872
Hi.

222
00:13:25,873 --> 00:13:28,780
I'm sorry I didn't give you
a heads up about the divorce papers.

223
00:13:28,781 --> 00:13:30,376
I'm sorry if I overreacted.

224
00:13:30,377 --> 00:13:32,771
Just the girls.

225
00:13:34,658 --> 00:13:38,401
- What's going on in there?
- I don't know.

226
00:13:38,491 --> 00:13:40,727
Smell like a man

227
00:13:40,728 --> 00:13:42,867
Stick, pump or can

228
00:13:42,868 --> 00:13:45,733
With Dry Guy Deodorant

229
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:48,232
Only the girls get sweaty

230
00:13:51,685 --> 00:13:53,568
We're getting there.

231
00:13:53,569 --> 00:13:55,133
Okay, thank you, Charlie.

232
00:13:55,134 --> 00:13:57,050
Yeah, we'll take it from here, okay?

233
00:13:57,051 --> 00:13:59,444
Too late. You're out.

234
00:13:59,511 --> 00:14:01,203
What about the songs we wrote?

235
00:14:01,204 --> 00:14:03,822
Hey, kids, what do you think about
the songs they wrote?

236
00:14:03,823 --> 00:14:06,216
They're bad.

237
00:14:10,307 --> 00:14:12,701
These are my people.

238
00:14:13,055 --> 00:14:18,037
What do your jingles have to do
with the lndustrial Revolution?

239
00:14:18,038 --> 00:14:20,433
Look, you wanted a show,
I'm giving you a show.

240
00:14:20,434 --> 00:14:23,115
Now step back and let us work.

241
00:14:23,309 --> 00:14:27,713
Plumber in a Jar.
Let's really sell it this time.

242
00:14:27,845 --> 00:14:31,895
When your sink backs up
there's just one star

243
00:14:31,934 --> 00:14:34,488
It's the one you trust
It's Plumber in a Jar

244
00:14:34,489 --> 00:14:36,883
Plumber in a Jar

245
00:14:46,469 --> 00:14:48,862
Hey, what you doing?

246
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:53,655
I'm trying to find some plausible
connection between my jingles

247
00:14:53,656 --> 00:14:56,193
and the lndustrial Revolution.

248
00:14:57,329 --> 00:14:59,820
- What's up?
- I just talked to my dad.

249
00:14:59,821 --> 00:15:03,685
He said that he and Mom
aren't getting back together again.

250
00:15:03,686 --> 00:15:05,922
Yeah.

251
00:15:05,923 --> 00:15:09,052
- How you doing with that?
- I'm not sure.

252
00:15:09,053 --> 00:15:11,320
I like that I get to stay here on weekends.

253
00:15:11,321 --> 00:15:13,204
That's cool. I like that, too.

254
00:15:13,205 --> 00:15:15,761
But you gotta be sad about your folks,
though, right?

255
00:15:15,761 --> 00:15:18,155
No, I'm okay.

256
00:15:18,892 --> 00:15:22,836
Jake, it's okay to feel sad, I've been told.

257
00:15:24,067 --> 00:15:27,260
- And this is a sad thing.
- My dad's not sad.

258
00:15:27,261 --> 00:15:29,656
Of course he is.
He's just trying to protect you.

259
00:15:29,657 --> 00:15:32,165
- From what?
- From being sad.

260
00:15:33,746 --> 00:15:38,632
Yeah, I know it's a vicious circle.
But the liquor industry is built on it.

261
00:15:38,633 --> 00:15:41,378
- What?
- It's not important.

262
00:15:41,508 --> 00:15:45,980
All you need to know is that
we all feel sad sometimes and it's okay.

263
00:15:45,981 --> 00:15:48,374
- Understand?
- Yeah.

264
00:15:55,468 --> 00:15:57,862
Hey, buddy.

265
00:15:58,471 --> 00:16:00,864
It's okay, Dad.

266
00:16:09,332 --> 00:16:13,196
Before the lndustrial Revolution,
we lived in an agrarian society.

267
00:16:13,197 --> 00:16:16,709
Most people grew their own food and
ate what they grew. Breakfast involved...

268
00:16:16,710 --> 00:16:18,403
slaughtering animals...

269
00:16:18,404 --> 00:16:20,320
and milking cows.

270
00:16:20,321 --> 00:16:23,162
It would be hundreds of years
before people could enjoy

271
00:16:23,163 --> 00:16:27,858
a pre-packaged and nutritious breakfast.
And what's in that breakfast?

272
00:16:27,859 --> 00:16:31,333
It's got oats and corns and wheat

273
00:16:31,405 --> 00:16:34,087
It's the sweetest breakfast treat

274
00:16:34,088 --> 00:16:36,482
It's maple-licious

275
00:16:36,835 --> 00:16:40,763
As urbanization led to stress and
loneliness, industrial society looked

276
00:16:40,764 --> 00:16:45,939
to an ancient agrarian product for
a delicious and refreshing solution.

277
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:48,622
The girls look prettier
with Hammerstein beer

278
00:16:48,623 --> 00:16:51,337
You like what you see
and you like what you hear

279
00:16:51,338 --> 00:16:53,925
Have a cold frosty mug and pull her near

280
00:16:53,926 --> 00:16:56,572
The girls look prettier

281
00:16:56,641 --> 00:17:00,547
The girls look prettier
with Hammerstein beer

282
00:17:00,953 --> 00:17:03,763
We're not letting him
anywhere near the Christmas pageant.

283
00:17:03,764 --> 00:17:06,157
Agreed.

284
00:17:10,121 --> 00:17:12,229
Even with the advent of indoor plumbing,

285
00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:15,583
the lndustrial Revolution
still had some bugs in the system.

286
00:17:15,584 --> 00:17:17,915
What was man to do?

287
00:17:17,916 --> 00:17:19,416
Three, four...

288
00:17:19,417 --> 00:17:21,810
Ifyour home is bug infested

289
00:17:21,876 --> 00:17:24,687
Filled with spiders, flies, and gnats

290
00:17:24,688 --> 00:17:27,115
All our sprays are safety tested

291
00:17:27,116 --> 00:17:30,884
We kill vermin, not your cats
