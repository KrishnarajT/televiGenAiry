1
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:08,463
Okay, after I get the tickets,
you line up for the popcorn,

2
00:00:08,464 --> 00:00:10,289
while I go nail down some good seats.

3
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:14,807
I want butter in the middle.
Don't just let them squirt it on the top.

4
00:00:14,808 --> 00:00:16,282
And a large cherry slurpy.

5
00:00:16,282 --> 00:00:18,845
Then you hold the seats
while I go to the men's room,

6
00:00:18,845 --> 00:00:20,447
and then I'll do the same for you.

7
00:00:20,448 --> 00:00:23,490
That way we can enjoy our drinks
during the movie without fear.

8
00:00:23,491 --> 00:00:25,892
Got you.

9
00:00:27,017 --> 00:00:29,835
- You're not gonna do any of that, are you?
- Nope.

10
00:00:29,836 --> 00:00:32,110
So you want to go in there
with no coordination,

11
00:00:32,111 --> 00:00:37,143
- no strategy, just winging it?
- That's what I'm thinking.

12
00:00:39,288 --> 00:00:42,102
I have no faith in this at all.

13
00:00:47,203 --> 00:00:51,688
Now for her,
I'd stand in line for a butter squirt.

14
00:00:51,688 --> 00:00:54,089
Yeah, she is a hottie.

15
00:00:56,111 --> 00:00:59,942
Hey, that's no hottie. That's your ex-wife.

16
00:01:02,423 --> 00:01:04,665
- Judith?
- Alan.

17
00:01:04,666 --> 00:01:07,182
Sorry about the squirt thing.

18
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:11,040
Wow, look at you. New hair, clothes.

19
00:01:11,041 --> 00:01:13,442
You look... Wow.

20
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:16,109
- Thank you.
- No, thank you.

21
00:01:17,642 --> 00:01:19,180
It's a public service

22
00:01:19,181 --> 00:01:23,730
when a gay chick goes lipstick
instead of lumberjack.

23
00:01:23,731 --> 00:01:26,928
So, how was the movie? Where's Jake?

24
00:01:26,934 --> 00:01:31,612
Home with the babysitter.
Alan, I'm kind of on a date.

25
00:01:31,613 --> 00:01:34,013
Okay, is that her?

26
00:01:34,272 --> 00:01:37,625
Hi, nice to meet you. I'm the ex.

27
00:01:39,207 --> 00:01:41,607
Alan, that's not my date.

28
00:01:42,314 --> 00:01:45,832
- Hey, Alan.
- Phil? What a coincidence.

29
00:01:45,935 --> 00:01:49,235
Phil is Jake's soccer coach.
Phil, you remember Judith.

30
00:01:49,236 --> 00:01:51,125
Well, yeah...

31
00:01:51,126 --> 00:01:53,496
One-Mississippi...

32
00:01:53,497 --> 00:01:55,258
- Alan?
- What?

33
00:01:55,259 --> 00:01:57,660
two-Mississippi.

34
00:01:58,784 --> 00:02:01,185
Oh, God.

35
00:02:01,668 --> 00:02:03,942
Okay, we're all caught up.

36
00:02:03,943 --> 00:02:07,338
Wait, you're dating Phil?
How can you be dating Phil?

37
00:02:07,339 --> 00:02:09,005
Alan, he asked me out.

38
00:02:09,006 --> 00:02:12,401
What about the whole gay thing?
Did you even give that a chance?

39
00:02:12,402 --> 00:02:13,650
Phil, we'd better go.

40
00:02:13,651 --> 00:02:16,438
Hey, look, Alan,
I hope this doesn't affect our friendship.

41
00:02:16,439 --> 00:02:20,283
- No. Call me, we'll hang out.
- Great. Hey, how's Tuesday?

42
00:02:20,284 --> 00:02:22,942
Tuesday's good.
Judith, how's Tuesday for you?

43
00:02:22,943 --> 00:02:25,025
Just walk away.

44
00:02:25,026 --> 00:02:29,127
I know you built your sundeck
without a permit and I am calling it in.

45
00:02:29,127 --> 00:02:30,344
Alan, chill.

46
00:02:30,345 --> 00:02:35,150
That two-faced, wife-poaching,
soccer-coaching, rat-bastard!

47
00:02:35,151 --> 00:02:36,721
Come on, let it go.

48
00:02:36,721 --> 00:02:39,861
- I'll treat you to a cherry slurpy.
- I don't want a cherry slurpy.

49
00:02:39,862 --> 00:02:44,356
Are you sure?
'Cause I think Phil's gonna get one.

50
00:02:52,775 --> 00:02:54,215
What does she think she's doing?

51
00:02:54,216 --> 00:02:56,523
She's straight, she's gay,
she's straight again.

52
00:02:56,524 --> 00:02:59,342
Place your bets.
Where she lands, nobody knows.

53
00:02:59,343 --> 00:03:01,008
Alan, it's no big deal.

54
00:03:01,009 --> 00:03:03,732
Women get to experiment
with their sexuality.

55
00:03:03,733 --> 00:03:07,256
It's only guys who have to make a choice
and stick to it.

56
00:03:07,257 --> 00:03:11,242
- Where do you get this stuff?
- I make it up.

57
00:03:11,551 --> 00:03:13,761
Anyway, it doesn't matter what Judith is.

58
00:03:13,762 --> 00:03:16,357
- lt only matters what she's not.
- And what is she not?

59
00:03:16,358 --> 00:03:19,479
She is not coming back to you, pal.

60
00:03:19,721 --> 00:03:21,195
Thank you for your sensitivity.

61
00:03:21,196 --> 00:03:24,239
All I'm saying is,
is that Judith has moved on with her life,

62
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:26,161
and maybe it's time for you
to do the same.

63
00:03:26,162 --> 00:03:28,084
I know. It's just... I can't.

64
00:03:28,085 --> 00:03:30,294
- Sure you can. I'll help you.
- How?

65
00:03:30,295 --> 00:03:34,012
I don't know, by saying things like,
"Sure you can. I'll help you."

66
00:03:34,013 --> 00:03:35,421
Great, thanks.

67
00:03:35,422 --> 00:03:37,376
Look, this isn't just about you, you know?

68
00:03:37,376 --> 00:03:40,740
All this wallowing in the past
is causing other people to suffer.

69
00:03:40,741 --> 00:03:43,229
- You mean Jake.
- I mean me.

70
00:03:43,881 --> 00:03:46,475
You are really starting to piss me off.

71
00:03:46,476 --> 00:03:49,039
Okay, that's enough help for now.

72
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:52,019
I'm saying maybe it's time
to stop feeling sorry for yourself.

73
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:55,223
- You're right, I know you're right.
- Forget Judith.

74
00:03:55,224 --> 00:03:59,484
There's a whole world out there
that you haven't pissed off yet.

75
00:03:59,485 --> 00:04:01,888
There is no reason I couldn't
find happiness with someone else.

76
00:04:01,889 --> 00:04:03,009
There you go.

77
00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:05,348
This could be the beginning
of the rest of my life.

78
00:04:05,349 --> 00:04:07,462
A bit of a bumper sticker,
but sure, why not?

79
00:04:07,463 --> 00:04:11,597
In fact, for the first time since college,
I can go after any woman I want.

80
00:04:11,597 --> 00:04:13,871
Heck, I could take a page from your book

81
00:04:13,872 --> 00:04:19,927
- and date them two, three at a time.
- Yeah, right. I mean, yeah, right.

82
00:04:19,928 --> 00:04:23,635
You know what?
I'm gonna start right now.

83
00:04:38,993 --> 00:04:41,393
I am gonna die alone.

84
00:04:41,876 --> 00:04:43,606
No.

85
00:04:43,607 --> 00:04:48,889
You just don't know how to sell yourself.
Give me a minute.

86
00:04:57,961 --> 00:05:01,995
- So?
- lf it was up to them, you'd die alone.

87
00:05:02,511 --> 00:05:05,298
- Great.
- Okay, here's the thing.

88
00:05:05,299 --> 00:05:08,534
If you want to play in this league,
you have to make a few changes.

89
00:05:08,535 --> 00:05:10,936
- Like what?
- Hang on.

90
00:05:22,730 --> 00:05:25,165
- Pretty much everything.
- Everything?

91
00:05:25,166 --> 00:05:28,881
Yep. The hair, the clothes,
the fuddy-duddy personality.

92
00:05:28,882 --> 00:05:30,739
What do they know about my personality?

93
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:33,141
Okay, that part's mine.

94
00:05:33,304 --> 00:05:36,187
Face it, Alan,
you've been an old fart since you were 14.

95
00:05:36,188 --> 00:05:37,436
What is that supposed to mean?

96
00:05:37,437 --> 00:05:41,281
It means, how many eighth-graders
carry a briefcase and a pocket watch?

97
00:05:41,282 --> 00:05:44,153
That was the Esperanto Club look.

98
00:05:44,166 --> 00:05:47,113
Unless you know where
all the hot Esperanto chicks hang out,

99
00:05:47,114 --> 00:05:49,196
you're gonna need
to shake things up a little.

100
00:05:49,197 --> 00:05:52,399
Really? And how to do I go about
"shaking things up"?

101
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,801
Hang on.

102
00:06:02,654 --> 00:06:05,977
This may take a while. Don't wait up.

103
00:06:08,677 --> 00:06:09,798
Hey, guess what?

104
00:06:09,799 --> 00:06:14,322
Coach Phil made me first-string
on the soccer team.

105
00:06:15,118 --> 00:06:19,257
- ls that so?
- Yeah, it's weird, 'cause I suck.

106
00:06:19,476 --> 00:06:22,654
Maybe Coach Phil sees some potential.

107
00:06:26,236 --> 00:06:29,600
- So, what else is new?
- Mom's got new clothes and new hair.

108
00:06:29,601 --> 00:06:31,811
It's like she's a different person
or something.

109
00:06:31,812 --> 00:06:34,695
- But she's still the same person, Jake.
- No, not really.

110
00:06:34,696 --> 00:06:38,316
She walks around the house
singing all the time.

111
00:06:38,317 --> 00:06:41,263
- She just sings for no reason?
- I guess.

112
00:06:41,264 --> 00:06:46,161
I wonder if it's the same reason
I sing for no reason.

113
00:06:46,359 --> 00:06:48,953
Does Coach Phil sing for no reason?

114
00:06:48,954 --> 00:06:51,355
For God's sake, Charlie!

115
00:06:51,966 --> 00:06:54,112
How come
you haven't changed anything yet, Dad?

116
00:06:54,113 --> 00:06:58,053
- Why should I change?
- So you'd look cool like Mom.

117
00:06:58,054 --> 00:07:01,418
- You don't think I look cool now?
- No.

118
00:07:01,419 --> 00:07:03,340
You know what,
it doesn't matter if I look cool,

119
00:07:03,341 --> 00:07:06,064
we judge a person by what's inside them,
not by what they wear.

120
00:07:06,065 --> 00:07:08,465
Lucky for you.

121
00:07:10,679 --> 00:07:11,991
Yeah, lucky.

122
00:07:11,992 --> 00:07:15,315
- I'm done. Can I go watch TV?
- Sure.

123
00:07:17,504 --> 00:07:21,719
Help me, Charlie.
I want to sing for no reason.

124
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:25,353
Get your jacket. It's time to go.

125
00:07:25,354 --> 00:07:27,403
I don't want to go. I hate clothes shopping.

126
00:07:27,404 --> 00:07:29,294
- You can't stay here alone.
- Why not?

127
00:07:29,295 --> 00:07:30,447
You know why not.

128
00:07:30,448 --> 00:07:34,965
But you don't have a turtle
to put in the microwave anymore.

129
00:07:34,966 --> 00:07:36,824
- Get your jacket.
- Fine.

130
00:07:36,825 --> 00:07:39,676
I'll put on my stupid jacket,
we'll get in the stupid car,

131
00:07:39,677 --> 00:07:41,342
and we'll go stupid clothes shopping.

132
00:07:41,343 --> 00:07:45,635
Hey, don't talk
to your stupid father like that.

133
00:07:45,957 --> 00:07:50,954
- So, you ready for your big makeover?
- You know what? Actually, I am.

134
00:07:50,955 --> 00:07:55,401
- I was up all night thinking about it.
- All night?

135
00:07:55,409 --> 00:07:58,004
Maybe your money's better spent
on a hooker.

136
00:07:58,005 --> 00:07:59,157
No, listen,

137
00:07:59,158 --> 00:08:01,849
I was in the bathroom,
looking at myself in the mirror,

138
00:08:01,850 --> 00:08:05,213
when I noticed, and I think I can be
completely objective about this,

139
00:08:05,214 --> 00:08:09,218
that I have a very nice ass
for a guy my age.

140
00:08:09,219 --> 00:08:14,953
And I think I should start dressing
in such a way as to play that card.

141
00:08:14,954 --> 00:08:17,355
You know, for the ladies.

142
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:22,161
Go ahead, check it out.

143
00:08:22,869 --> 00:08:25,269
Am I lying?

144
00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:29,918
- Hi, Mom.
- Good, you remember me.

145
00:08:30,142 --> 00:08:33,119
- Hello, Charlie.
- Hey, Mom, right?

146
00:08:34,243 --> 00:08:37,222
Very cute. I was in the neighborhood,
I thought I'd stop by.

147
00:08:37,223 --> 00:08:40,498
I'm sorry, Mom. We were just leaving.

148
00:08:40,652 --> 00:08:42,253
It never fails, does it?

149
00:08:42,254 --> 00:08:45,585
Whenever I would like to spend
some quality time with my grandson

150
00:08:45,586 --> 00:08:47,860
there's always something
more important going on.

151
00:08:47,861 --> 00:08:49,046
It's not fair, you know.

152
00:08:49,047 --> 00:08:51,866
I'm not getting clothes,
so why do I have to go and be bored?

153
00:08:51,867 --> 00:08:53,724
You don't,
you can stay here with Grandma.

154
00:08:53,725 --> 00:08:55,454
- What?
- What?

155
00:08:55,455 --> 00:08:57,921
- Have fun.
- Wait, no, I'll be good, I swear.

156
00:08:57,922 --> 00:09:00,323
Payback's a bitch, buddy.

157
00:09:10,835 --> 00:09:14,039
- This department looks nice.
- You're sure?

158
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:18,620
Because this is the top floor.
There's no more clothes above this floor.

159
00:09:18,621 --> 00:09:23,221
- No, I have a good feeling about this floor.
- Great.

160
00:09:23,267 --> 00:09:27,329
- How about this shirt?
- No, I don't think so.

161
00:09:29,452 --> 00:09:31,341
Okay.

162
00:09:31,342 --> 00:09:33,743
- How about this?
- No.

163
00:09:34,002 --> 00:09:36,307
Good.

164
00:09:36,308 --> 00:09:38,930
- This one?
- No.

165
00:09:40,634 --> 00:09:43,035
- This?
- No.

166
00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:45,952
Tell you what,
why don't you pick something?

167
00:09:45,953 --> 00:09:49,829
- I thought you were gonna help me?
- Pick something.

168
00:09:49,830 --> 00:09:52,867
Okay, flying solo.

169
00:10:21,167 --> 00:10:24,370
This is something
I could see myself wearing.

170
00:10:24,371 --> 00:10:26,229
- You like this?
- Yeah.

171
00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:28,631
Let me see that.

172
00:10:37,573 --> 00:10:43,467
Please, if she has one more facelift,
she'll be wearing her ass as a hat.

173
00:10:43,468 --> 00:10:45,869
Jake, honey,

174
00:10:45,935 --> 00:10:50,180
turn the TV down,
Grandmommy's on the telephone.

175
00:10:50,837 --> 00:10:52,823
I'm sorry, what?

176
00:10:52,824 --> 00:10:58,078
No, I'm just spending
a little quality time with my grandson.

177
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:03,255
He's an amazing boy.
We're very close, two peas in a pod.

178
00:11:03,879 --> 00:11:06,917
What? Hold on.

179
00:11:09,101 --> 00:11:11,592
Jake, how old are you?

180
00:11:12,626 --> 00:11:15,027
- Ten.
- Seven.

181
00:11:15,606 --> 00:11:17,848
I said, "Ten."

182
00:11:17,849 --> 00:11:20,249
If I'm 55, you're seven.

183
00:11:21,694 --> 00:11:24,833
He's an adorable boy,
and he just loves me so much.

184
00:11:24,834 --> 00:11:29,832
Jake, tell my friend, Cheryl,
how much you love Grandmommy.

185
00:11:29,833 --> 00:11:31,562
Go on, darling.

186
00:11:31,563 --> 00:11:33,963
I'm 10.

187
00:11:36,562 --> 00:11:38,194
How's it going in there?

188
00:11:38,195 --> 00:11:42,292
Whatever happened to zippers?
I miss zippers.

189
00:11:43,130 --> 00:11:47,743
I don't know, Alan.
Maybe there were too many injuries.

190
00:11:47,744 --> 00:11:52,289
Nobody ever got their balls
caught in a buttonhole.

191
00:11:52,614 --> 00:11:55,497
- Come on out, let's see.
- I'm just not sure about this.

192
00:11:55,498 --> 00:11:58,701
We're never gonna find the right
look for you unless we experiment.

193
00:11:58,702 --> 00:12:01,103
Now, let's see.

194
00:12:08,443 --> 00:12:11,516
I'm not happy with visible nipples.

195
00:12:11,679 --> 00:12:14,800
Yeah, that's what is wrong with it.

196
00:13:07,913 --> 00:13:10,573
That's it. We need a gay guy.

197
00:13:14,321 --> 00:13:17,684
His name is Sponge Bob Square Pants,
and his friend's name is Patrick.

198
00:13:17,685 --> 00:13:20,408
He's a starfish, and he lives
on the same street Sponge Bob,

199
00:13:20,409 --> 00:13:23,227
and he's unbelievably dumb.
Squidward lives there, too.

200
00:13:23,228 --> 00:13:25,502
Of course, he's a squid
and he hates Sponge Bob,

201
00:13:25,503 --> 00:13:26,784
and he plays the clarinet.

202
00:13:26,785 --> 00:13:30,437
Both Squidward and Sponge Bob
work at the Crusty Krab for Mr. Krab,

203
00:13:30,438 --> 00:13:32,712
who's really cheap,
but Sponge Bob doesn't care

204
00:13:32,713 --> 00:13:35,500
because he just likes being
a fry cook and making Krabby...

205
00:13:35,501 --> 00:13:37,902
So, bottom line,

206
00:13:38,481 --> 00:13:40,881
he's a sponge?

207
00:13:42,293 --> 00:13:43,414
Yeah.

208
00:13:43,415 --> 00:13:47,547
His pants are square 'cause he's square
and so is his underwear.

209
00:13:47,548 --> 00:13:50,816
They're tighty-whities, but they're square.

210
00:13:50,817 --> 00:13:54,565
- Oh, dear God.
- He has a pet snail named Gary, that...

211
00:13:54,566 --> 00:13:59,194
Okay, relax the shoulders, good.
The style suits you,

212
00:13:59,243 --> 00:14:02,422
the pants hang beautifully. Oh, dear.

213
00:14:02,512 --> 00:14:03,664
What?

214
00:14:03,665 --> 00:14:06,131
You're not gonna
be wearing those shoes, are you?

215
00:14:06,132 --> 00:14:08,118
- Say no.
- No.

216
00:14:08,119 --> 00:14:10,585
Could you show us some shoes
that will go with this?

217
00:14:10,586 --> 00:14:16,041
I'm sorry, I don't actually work here.
I came in for a belt.

218
00:14:16,354 --> 00:14:19,557
Okay, we got an outfit.
Let's go find some shoes.

219
00:14:19,558 --> 00:14:21,960
No, Charlie,
I'm done. I can't do this anymore.

220
00:14:21,961 --> 00:14:25,196
Don't worry. I'm sure there'll
be a gay guy in the shoe department.

221
00:14:25,197 --> 00:14:27,696
No, I've changed my mind.
I don't want new clothes.

222
00:14:27,697 --> 00:14:30,579
What? You look great.
That guy said you looked stunning.

223
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:33,207
He said "fabulous,"
but that's not the point.

224
00:14:33,208 --> 00:14:35,706
- This is not who I am.
- Yeah.

225
00:14:35,707 --> 00:14:40,352
But who you are couldn't get laid
underwater with a tank full of oxygen.

226
00:14:40,353 --> 00:14:42,723
- Forget it, let's just go home.
- Wait a second.

227
00:14:42,724 --> 00:14:45,639
I spend all day schlepping
from store to store with you,

228
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:48,234
Iistening to you whine,
and now that we finally found

229
00:14:48,235 --> 00:14:52,079
- something that works, you want to bail?
- I don't feel comfortable in this stuff.

230
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:55,091
- I knew it. I knew you'd chicken out.
- Chicken out?

231
00:14:55,092 --> 00:14:58,135
I'm not even gonna dignify that
with a response.

232
00:14:58,136 --> 00:15:01,019
At least your wife
had the guts to try something new.

233
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:02,332
Don't go there, Charlie.

234
00:15:02,333 --> 00:15:04,896
I mean, the soccer coach
was kind of a sideways move,

235
00:15:04,897 --> 00:15:06,978
- but you gotta admire the effort.
- Fine.

236
00:15:06,979 --> 00:15:09,414
I will buy the stupid clothes,
but I'm never ever

237
00:15:09,415 --> 00:15:12,971
- going to do this with you again.
- Promise?

238
00:15:12,972 --> 00:15:16,294
I just hope he's worth all the drama.

239
00:15:20,309 --> 00:15:24,024
Hello. Mom, Jake?

240
00:15:24,891 --> 00:15:27,291
In here.

241
00:15:30,178 --> 00:15:31,362
Hello.

242
00:15:31,363 --> 00:15:33,478
- Hey, Dad.
- Hi, Alan.

243
00:15:33,479 --> 00:15:37,002
- Rose, what are you doing here?
- Babysitting.

244
00:15:37,003 --> 00:15:39,406
- Where's my mother?
- She left.

245
00:15:39,406 --> 00:15:41,328
- Why?
- I don't know.

246
00:15:41,329 --> 00:15:43,251
We were watching
Sponge Bob Square Pants,

247
00:15:43,251 --> 00:15:47,544
and she stood up and said,
"Life was too short."

248
00:15:48,154 --> 00:15:51,517
Luckily, I happened to be out on the deck,

249
00:15:51,518 --> 00:15:54,619
not doing anything, just passing by,

250
00:15:55,010 --> 00:15:57,622
and she asked me to baby-sit.

251
00:15:58,471 --> 00:16:02,088
- Dad, you look cool.
- Really? You think?

252
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:04,941
Yeah, very sexy.

253
00:16:06,322 --> 00:16:08,467
So where is Charlie?

254
00:16:08,468 --> 00:16:11,255
He dropped me off.
We had a little disagreement.

255
00:16:11,256 --> 00:16:13,973
Was it about those dorky shoes?

256
00:16:30,608 --> 00:16:33,009
- Hi.
- Hi.

257
00:16:33,525 --> 00:16:36,799
- Mind if I join you?
- Might as well.

258
00:16:37,049 --> 00:16:40,170
You're gonna have to drive me home.

259
00:16:40,894 --> 00:16:44,065
I just wanted to say that
I know you were just trying to help,

260
00:16:44,066 --> 00:16:45,924
and I appreciate it.

261
00:16:45,925 --> 00:16:47,046
Thanks.

262
00:16:47,047 --> 00:16:51,146
I just got a little panicky.
Change is not easy for me, Charlie.

263
00:16:51,147 --> 00:16:53,548
Really? I hadn't noticed.

264
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:55,760
And I'm not just talking about the clothes.

265
00:16:55,761 --> 00:16:57,875
The clothes are only the tip of the iceberg.

266
00:16:57,876 --> 00:16:59,701
Only the tip of the iceberg.

267
00:16:59,702 --> 00:17:02,852
Leanne, I'm gonna need another shot.

268
00:17:03,036 --> 00:17:05,245
- Continue.
- Yeah, it's like,

269
00:17:05,246 --> 00:17:07,873
I was married a long time, Charlie.

270
00:17:07,873 --> 00:17:10,340
It's who I was, it was my identity,

271
00:17:10,340 --> 00:17:14,377
"Married Guy,"Husband Man,"
"Captain Dependable,"

272
00:17:14,378 --> 00:17:16,332
and I had a uniform.

273
00:17:16,333 --> 00:17:20,304
And, I don't know,
I guess, I just didn't want to take it off.

274
00:17:20,305 --> 00:17:24,425
'Cause you'd lose your powers
of dependability?

275
00:17:25,272 --> 00:17:29,817
- So, Charlie, who's your friend?
- My brother, Alan.

276
00:17:30,303 --> 00:17:33,153
Hi, Alan. I'm Leanne. It's nice to meet you.

277
00:17:33,154 --> 00:17:36,630
I've actually met you a bunch of times.

278
00:17:37,128 --> 00:17:39,113
No, I'd remember you.

279
00:17:39,114 --> 00:17:45,553
I come in here with Charlie all the time,
I always order a rum and Diet Coke?

280
00:17:45,554 --> 00:17:47,284
Right.

281
00:17:47,285 --> 00:17:49,776
So, Alan, the usual?

282
00:17:50,361 --> 00:17:53,404
No, today let's try something different.

283
00:17:53,405 --> 00:17:56,608
- Charlie, what are you having?
- Tequila shooters with a beer back.

284
00:17:56,609 --> 00:18:00,086
Great. I will have a rum and Diet Coke.

285
00:18:00,999 --> 00:18:03,400
You've got it, hon.

286
00:18:04,139 --> 00:18:06,926
Was she flirting with me?
I think she was flirting with me.

287
00:18:06,927 --> 00:18:09,361
I think there was definitely a connection.

288
00:18:09,362 --> 00:18:12,373
Alan, you do understand
she works for tips?

289
00:18:12,373 --> 00:18:15,398
- Rum and Diet Coke, please?
- Here.

290
00:18:16,923 --> 00:18:18,813
- Did you see that?
- What do you expect?

291
00:18:18,814 --> 00:18:22,751
You bought a sport jacket,
not a magic lamp.

292
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:47,361
Hello.

293
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:50,635
I didn't see you back there.

294
00:18:58,130 --> 00:19:00,530
Oh, yeah.

295
00:19:04,890 --> 00:19:08,366
I'm ready for my close-up, Mr. DeMille.
