1
00:00:01,550 --> 00:00:03,450
Let's see, what else?

2
00:00:03,450 --> 00:00:07,370
Okay. Here's one of the first things
your uncle Charlie wrote.

3
00:00:07,370 --> 00:00:10,990
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles

4
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:17,650
What do you think?

5
00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:20,290
Must have been before my time.

6
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:25,130
Okay, we're done here.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,950
Don't put your juice box on the piano,
it leaves a ring.

8
00:00:29,950 --> 00:00:32,570
How could a box leave a ring?

9
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:34,830
Got to run to the grocery store.

10
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:36,990
I'm gonna need somebody
to fold these clothes.

11
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:38,530
I don't know if the grocery store

12
00:00:38,530 --> 00:00:41,350
is the first place I'd go for that,
but good luck.

13
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:45,050
Remember, you're being punished.
So, no TV, no computer, no GameBoy.

14
00:00:45,050 --> 00:00:46,720
I need you to be my eyes and ears.

15
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:50,950
Okay, but you have to be
my liver and prostate.

16
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,010
Whoa, whose is this?

17
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:57,420
Charlie, you want to field that one?

18
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:01,300
No problem. Jake, sometimes when you
have a casual sexual relationship...

19
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:03,710
All right!

20
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:09,520
Jake, we take in strangers' laundry
because we're poor.

21
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:13,790
I'll be back in an hour.
Start folding. No TV.

22
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:17,980
What'd you get busted for?

23
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:19,610
I painted my room at Mom's house.

24
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:23,530
- What's wrong with that?
- I'm 10 years old.

25
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:29,060
- How about a little sock golf?
- What's that?

26
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:30,960
Okay, here's how it works.

27
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:34,240
The living room is a dogleg par four.

28
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:37,770
That means you have to get your sock
into the kitchen sink

29
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:40,110
- in four strokes or less.
- Okay.

30
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:43,010
We'll play for a quarter a hole.

31
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:44,540
Your handicap's obvious.

32
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:47,630
You're short, and you've never
heard of the Ninja Turtles.

33
00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:50,000
All right, keep your knees bent.

34
00:01:50,010 --> 00:01:52,880
Your arm straight and swing easy.

35
00:01:56,940 --> 00:01:59,130
Oh, man, I'm being hustled.

36
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:03,180
- We can play for less if you want.
- Don't get cocky.

37
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:05,580
There's 17 more holes.

38
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:16,280
The 18th hole, all square.

39
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:20,490
The defending champion looks
to have an easy tap-in for a birdie

40
00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:24,380
as the gallery waits breathlessly
for the rookie to respond.

41
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:26,980
Would you please stop talking?

42
00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:31,450
Tempers flare as the pressure mounts.

43
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:38,220
- Yeah.
- It's unbelievable.

44
00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:39,770
An eagle on the 18th.

45
00:02:39,770 --> 00:02:42,660
This has never happened before
in the history of sock golf!

46
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:44,010
A little help here?

47
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:46,960
Fans are coming out of the gallery
with sacks of groceries

48
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:49,370
- for the young phenom.
- What's going on?

49
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:51,170
I won. I beat Uncle Charlie.

50
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:53,740
Excuse me, didn't I ask you
to fold the laundry?

51
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:56,210
Laundry? Are you barking mad?

52
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:59,650
The child just won the coveted
Palmolive Cup.

53
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:02,890
I won. You lose.

54
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:06,040
When I ask Jake to do something,

55
00:03:06,050 --> 00:03:07,940
I need you to help me
make sure he does it.

56
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:10,410
I'm trying to teach him responsibility.

57
00:03:10,410 --> 00:03:12,340
This sock is soaking wet.

58
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:16,840
Yeah, I chipped into the water hazard
on the ninth and the lid was open.

59
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:20,150
- So, this is toilet water?
- At least.

60
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:30,040
All right.
I put Jake to bed, I folded the laundry,

61
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:31,520
I put the groceries away...

62
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:33,900
The guilt thing doesn't work on me, Alan.

63
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:37,270
Yeah, well, it's all I got.
I'll be back in a little while.

64
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:40,480
- Where you going?
- I have to bring the garbage cans back in.

65
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:42,120
Today wasn't garbage day.

66
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:45,840
- No, not here. At Judith's.
- At Judith's?

67
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:48,670
Alan, your wife threw you out.

68
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:50,990
Yeah, that doesn't mean
she doesn't need me.

69
00:03:50,990 --> 00:03:53,390
Yeah, it kind of does.

70
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:57,990
Look, we're still married,
it's still my house,

71
00:03:57,990 --> 00:04:00,240
and she still counts on me
to do a few chores.

72
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:04,190
It's good. It leaves the door open for,
you know, reconciliation.

73
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:05,700
I see.

74
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:10,590
So, how do you lift those garbage cans
without a spine?

75
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:16,780
They're on wheels.

76
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:27,160
What are you watching?

77
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:29,020
I'm watching a movie,

78
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:31,430
and you're not supposed
to be watching anything.

79
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:33,070
Oh, yeah.

80
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:36,960
- ls that guy a good guy or a bad guy?
- Good guy.

81
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:39,300
And you're not supposed
to be watching TV.

82
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:41,710
I know.

83
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:47,400
- ls that his girlfriend?
- Ex-girlfriend.

84
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:49,130
But he still loves her, right?

85
00:04:49,130 --> 00:04:52,860
I'm not going to walk you
through the whole movie.

86
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:55,270
I think so.

87
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:57,770
- Go to bed, Jake.
- Okay.

88
00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:02,690
Who's that guy?

89
00:05:02,690 --> 00:05:04,420
That's the guy he was in jail with

90
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:06,290
and told him
where the money was hidden.

91
00:05:06,290 --> 00:05:08,440
Right.

92
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:11,950
- You're being punished. No TV.
- I know.

93
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:22,860
What the hell is going on?

94
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:26,360
- Jake?
- Goodnight.

95
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,410
Hey, I'm watching that.

96
00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:33,630
What part of "no TV"
didn't you understand?

97
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:35,680
I'm allowed to watch TV.

98
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:36,970
I mean Jake.

99
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:40,370
I said, "No TV." He said, "Okay."
I said, "Go to bed." He said, "Okay."

100
00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:43,100
- What'd you want from me?
- He's taking advantage of you

101
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:44,770
because he knows
you won't follow through.

102
00:05:44,770 --> 00:05:47,760
He obviously knows me
better than you do.

103
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:50,650
If this is gonna work out
with Jake living here part-time,

104
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:53,290
you have to be an adult.
You have to impose discipline.

105
00:05:53,290 --> 00:05:55,470
Yeah, fine, whatever.
Give me back the remote.

106
00:05:55,470 --> 00:05:57,980
No. You're not listening to me.
You need to be firm.

107
00:05:57,980 --> 00:06:00,290
Okay.

108
00:06:00,290 --> 00:06:03,280
- Go to your room.
- Yes, like that.

109
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:06,260
I mean it. Give me the remote
and go to your room.

110
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:08,220
That's very funny.

111
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:13,130
I'm serious. Get out of here,
or I will kick your ass.

112
00:06:19,730 --> 00:06:22,130
Oh, man.

113
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:37,580
Shoo.

114
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:49,920
Jake.

115
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:53,010
It was on when I came in.

116
00:06:55,390 --> 00:06:56,960
Yeah, right.

117
00:06:56,970 --> 00:06:59,960
What did I tell you about leaving
juice boxes on my piano?

118
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:02,370
How do you know it's mine?

119
00:07:03,330 --> 00:07:08,880
Come on, who else around here drinks
"Transylvania Goofy Juice"?

120
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:11,310
Good point.

121
00:07:11,670 --> 00:07:14,910
And another thing. Were you on the deck
feeding the seagulls again?

122
00:07:14,910 --> 00:07:17,320
Sorry, I forgot.

123
00:07:17,810 --> 00:07:20,470
Okay. We need to talk.

124
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:24,400
Love you, Uncle Charlie.

125
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:27,870
Look, we don't feed the seagulls
because you can't get rid of them.

126
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:29,740
We don't leave
the doors and windows open,

127
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:32,570
because we get all kinds of bugs
and crap flying in the house.

128
00:07:32,570 --> 00:07:34,950
- Okay.
- No. Don't just say "okay."

129
00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:37,430
This is not the grownup
telling the kid what to do.

130
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:39,970
This is just two guys agreeing
how to live together.

131
00:07:39,970 --> 00:07:42,380
- Are we cool?
- Yeah. Cool.

132
00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:46,240
- What's going on?
- Nothing.

133
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,650
- Was he watching TV?
- No.

134
00:07:50,710 --> 00:07:53,190
Jake, I have to run a quick errand.

135
00:07:53,190 --> 00:07:56,560
Why don't you wash and dress?
When I get back, we'll do something fun.

136
00:07:56,570 --> 00:07:58,980
- Can we watch TV?
- Go.

137
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,670
Where are you off to?

138
00:08:03,670 --> 00:08:06,080
The grocery store.

139
00:08:10,850 --> 00:08:14,770
- You're going to Judith's, aren't you?
- No.

140
00:08:16,150 --> 00:08:18,560
Then where are you going?

141
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:21,110
Judith's.

142
00:08:21,330 --> 00:08:22,970
- Alan.
- I have to.

143
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:26,290
The timer on the sprinkler system
is broken,

144
00:08:26,290 --> 00:08:30,850
and the flower beds are getting flooded,
and I love her and I want her back.

145
00:08:30,850 --> 00:08:33,170
Buddy, I feel for you.

146
00:08:33,170 --> 00:08:37,490
- Thank you.
- Unfortunately, the feeling is nausea.

147
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:40,400
Great. I'll see you later.

148
00:08:40,410 --> 00:08:43,240
Alan, you've been making
the same mistake your whole life.

149
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:46,710
Being the good boy, fixing everything
so everybody would love you.

150
00:08:46,710 --> 00:08:48,060
It didn't work with Mom.

151
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:51,530
It didn't work with either of the women
you went out with.

152
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:53,370
And it's not gonna work with your wife.

153
00:08:53,370 --> 00:08:58,670
You know nothing about commitment
and responsibility to a relationship.

154
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:01,440
Granted. But I do know
when a woman's using me.

155
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:04,180
And by that I mean not in a fun way.

156
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:08,840
Well, you can rest easy,
because no one is using me.

157
00:09:09,970 --> 00:09:14,150
And did you mean that I only dated
two women including Judith?

158
00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:18,220
Because if you did,
I have two words for you.

159
00:09:18,590 --> 00:09:21,000
Maxine Chernakoff.

160
00:09:32,290 --> 00:09:35,470
- Did you fix it?
- Not quite.

161
00:09:35,530 --> 00:09:37,560
It doesn't seem like
you're changing anything.

162
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:43,220
No? Well, sometimes change happens,
Judith, and you can't see it.

163
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:45,310
Okay. Fine. When you're done fixing this,

164
00:09:45,310 --> 00:09:47,820
would you come and take a look
at the garbage disposal?

165
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:50,230
- Sure.
- Thank you.

166
00:09:50,710 --> 00:09:53,120
Wait, no.

167
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,700
What?

168
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:59,110
No, I won't come inside
and look at the garbage disposal.

169
00:09:59,110 --> 00:10:01,520
Why not?

170
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:06,800
I know when I'm being used, Judith,
and not in a fun way.

171
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,280
What are you talking about?

172
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:10,910
Who are we kidding? The marriage is over.

173
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:14,260
You're just afraid to move on,
so, you keep dragging me over here,

174
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:18,310
and I'm afraid to move on,
so I keep coming.

175
00:10:19,630 --> 00:10:22,200
Goodbye, Judith. You're free.

176
00:10:23,010 --> 00:10:27,520
I hope you find
whatever it is you're looking for.

177
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:43,430
- What you got there?
- Just a little bread.

178
00:10:43,430 --> 00:10:48,130
Please tell me you're not feeding
the seagulls again.

179
00:10:48,510 --> 00:10:50,920
Okay.

180
00:10:51,410 --> 00:10:55,270
Man, did you let another one of those
big flappy bastards in the house?

181
00:10:55,270 --> 00:10:58,360
You have to put $1 in the swear jar,
you said "bastards."

182
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:00,770
Smart, poke the bear.

183
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:04,970
I'm telling you, Jake, this is the last...

184
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:09,970
Yikes!

185
00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:15,400
I'm really sorry, Uncle Charlie.

186
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:17,400
I don't want to talk to you right now.

187
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:23,350
Hello, do you have a department
of animal control or bird abatement?

188
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:25,760
I have a seagull problem.

189
00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:28,400
Seagull.

190
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:30,330
Thank you, I'll hold.

191
00:11:30,330 --> 00:11:32,420
I didn't know there'd be so many.

192
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:36,280
I told you, don't feed the damn things.
I told you, don't leave the windows open.

193
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:38,690
Yeah, hi, who's this?

194
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:41,330
Phyllis Siegal.

195
00:11:48,410 --> 00:11:53,200
No, Phyllis, I wanted to talk to somebody
about seagulls.

196
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:56,480
I got a flock of seagulls in my house.

197
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:59,530
No, I don't know
whatever happened to them.

198
00:11:59,530 --> 00:12:01,300
I'm really sorry.

199
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:03,810
We had an agreement, Jake,
and you broke it.

200
00:12:03,810 --> 00:12:08,860
Look, I need somebody who can come over
with a net or something.

201
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:10,760
Sure, I'll hold.

202
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:13,170
Hello? Who's this?

203
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,810
Annette.

204
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:21,820
Look, I got a room
filled with seagulls and... No.

205
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:25,590
Hi, Phyllis.

206
00:12:25,590 --> 00:12:27,130
Goodbye, Phyllis.

207
00:12:27,130 --> 00:12:28,840
Good news.

208
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:31,340
Really? Come tell me in Jake's room.

209
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:34,240
What did he do?
He didn't paint anything, did he?

210
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,660
I want you to be surprised.

211
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:41,670
You will never guess what happened
while I was at Judith's.

212
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:44,080
Neither will you.

213
00:12:45,010 --> 00:12:46,980
Oh, my God!

214
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:49,390
So, what's your good news?

215
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:51,290
Open the door!

216
00:12:51,290 --> 00:12:54,340
Your kid got them in there,
you get them out.

217
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:57,010
Open the door!

218
00:13:02,710 --> 00:13:05,150
That was not funny, Charlie.

219
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:09,200
Depends on what side of the door
you were on.

220
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,550
Look, I'm really sorry about the birds,

221
00:13:11,550 --> 00:13:13,800
but I'm sure they'll leave
as soon as they get hungry.

222
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:15,730
That's what I thought about you.

223
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:18,980
You know what? Jake and I may be
out of here sooner than you think.

224
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:22,320
- What do you mean?
- At Judith's, there was kissing.

225
00:13:22,330 --> 00:13:26,540
Mutual kissing. Unprompted,
but reciprocated by yours truly.

226
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:27,820
Wow.

227
00:13:27,830 --> 00:13:30,590
And was it as boring as it sounds?

228
00:13:30,590 --> 00:13:32,130
Charlie, she kissed me.

229
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:37,250
This wasn't the kiss of a woman who just
wanted her garbage disposal unclogged.

230
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:40,050
Well, you know her plumbing
better than I do.

231
00:13:40,050 --> 00:13:43,590
You know what I'm gonna do?
I'm gonna let her come to me.

232
00:13:43,590 --> 00:13:46,090
You know, be detached,
play it cool. You know?

233
00:13:46,090 --> 00:13:49,030
Yeah. That's your home-run swing.

234
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:52,980
Hey, Uncle Charlie,
you want to play some sock golf?

235
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:55,260
- No, thanks.
- Where are you going?

236
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:56,550
I'm going for a drive.

237
00:13:56,550 --> 00:13:58,960
- Can I come?
- Nope.

238
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:05,680
I don't think
Uncle Charlie likes me anymore.

239
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:08,670
Don't be silly.
He's just a little upset about the 30, 40

240
00:14:08,670 --> 00:14:10,960
screaming, crapping birds in his house.

241
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:14,140
Why don't you write him a note
and tell him how sorry you are?

242
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:16,330
Okay.

243
00:14:16,330 --> 00:14:19,030
Don't worry, he'll come around.

244
00:14:19,030 --> 00:14:22,450
Sooner or later, everybody comes around.

245
00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:28,170
You just have to give them a little time
and a little space.

246
00:14:29,030 --> 00:14:31,440
Hello, Judith?

247
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:36,850
- What's in the bucket?
- Chum.

248
00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:41,440
- What?
- Bait.

249
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:45,040
I went down to the bait shop
and asked them what seagulls like to eat.

250
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:46,910
We're keeping them?

251
00:14:46,910 --> 00:14:49,420
No. We're gonna throw the bait
out the window

252
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:51,310
to lure the birds out of the house.

253
00:14:51,310 --> 00:14:53,530
That's pretty clever.

254
00:14:53,530 --> 00:14:59,350
Yeah, it's a variation on something I do
with women and tennis bracelets.

255
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:02,870
Hey, Uncle Charlie, I made this for you.

256
00:15:07,270 --> 00:15:09,130
Thanks.

257
00:15:09,130 --> 00:15:11,320
I made it myself.

258
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:13,730
I see that.

259
00:15:14,310 --> 00:15:16,880
- What are you doing?
- I'm getting rid of the birds.

260
00:15:16,890 --> 00:15:19,300
- Can I help?
- Nope.

261
00:15:19,590 --> 00:15:22,670
Jake, why don't you go out
and play on the deck, okay?

262
00:15:22,670 --> 00:15:25,080
Okay.

263
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:29,240
What is wrong with you?

264
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:31,900
He worked really hard on that card.
You barely looked at it.

265
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:34,960
- What do you want from me?
- He's dying for you to forgive him.

266
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:37,370
Fine. I forgive him.

267
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:42,460
Now, are you gonna help me or not?
I got a serious problem here.

268
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:46,470
Really? Because you look like
you have it all together.

269
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:48,890
Okay, here's the deal.

270
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:52,970
We go in there and start throwing
this stuff out the windows.

271
00:15:52,970 --> 00:15:54,390
When the last bird's out,

272
00:15:54,390 --> 00:15:57,410
we close the window
and get on with our lives.

273
00:15:57,410 --> 00:15:59,820
You're ready?

274
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:01,980
Sure.

275
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:08,460
You know, if they love this bait so much,
why would they even wait for...

276
00:16:18,710 --> 00:16:21,600
It's almost like somebody tipped them off.

277
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:24,330
- You got any other bright ideas?
- Yeah.

278
00:16:24,330 --> 00:16:28,350
I'm gonna get a drywall guy in there
and seal off that room.

279
00:16:28,350 --> 00:16:31,090
- Very funny.
- I'm not kidding.

280
00:16:31,730 --> 00:16:34,140
That room is dead to me.

281
00:16:35,210 --> 00:16:37,490
Either that or sell the house.

282
00:16:37,490 --> 00:16:41,380
I'll put it on the market
as a two bedroom plus aviary.

283
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:43,790
Everybody loves an aviary.

284
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:45,720
What about Jake?

285
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:48,520
Are you gonna put him on the market
or just wall him off?

286
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:50,100
I tried with that kid, Alan.

287
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:52,700
He says one thing,
and then he goes and does another.

288
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:56,300
He's 10. He's got the attention span
of a hummingbird.

289
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:58,460
What am I supposed to do
when he ignores me?

290
00:16:58,460 --> 00:17:01,640
You punish him. You take away
his computer, his TV, his toys.

291
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:03,380
You already took away all the good stuff.

292
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:06,210
What am I supposed to take away?
His bronchial inhaler?

293
00:17:06,210 --> 00:17:12,020
You know what I'm saying, Charlie.
You don't take away your love.

294
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:58,140
Hi. I tried calling
but I kept getting your machine,

295
00:17:58,140 --> 00:18:00,810
- so I thought I'd bring this over.
- What is it?

296
00:18:00,810 --> 00:18:05,120
It's my master file of handymen, plumbers,
electricians, maintenance schedules,

297
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:08,200
warranties, authorized repair centers,

298
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:10,260
et cetera.

299
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:13,540
Okay, well, you're on your own.
Got to run.

300
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:15,950
Alan, wait.

301
00:18:18,470 --> 00:18:21,160
- Yes?
- About that kiss?

302
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:28,440
When you said we should move on,
I got scared, and...

303
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:31,040
Alan, I kissed you out of fear.

304
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:33,450
Hey, it still counts.

305
00:18:33,650 --> 00:18:37,150
Alan, you were right. We have to move on.

306
00:18:37,150 --> 00:18:39,560
Okay.

307
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:42,330
Alan, wait.

308
00:18:45,930 --> 00:18:47,090
Yes?

309
00:18:47,090 --> 00:18:49,700
The garbage disposal's still making
that horrible noise.

310
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:52,200
I keep telling you not to put bones in it.

311
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:56,440
- I didn't.
- The sink trap does not lie, Judith.

312
00:18:57,260 --> 00:18:59,800
This is so cool, Uncle Charlie.

313
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:03,980
Yeah, I was kind of hard on you,
and I wanted to make it up.

314
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:06,070
So, you're not still mad
about the seagulls?

315
00:19:06,070 --> 00:19:09,380
I'm still mad. I just figured out
a better way to deal with it.

316
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:12,790
Well, I think this is a very good way.

317
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:15,490
Me, too.

318
00:19:15,490 --> 00:19:16,880
I'm buying you all this stuff,

319
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:20,160
but as punishment for letting seagulls
in my house,

320
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,050
you can't play with it for a month.

321
00:19:22,050 --> 00:19:23,630
A month?

322
00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:26,040
Pretty smart, huh?

323
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:28,450
It's not fair.

324
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:30,610
You know what this is?

325
00:19:30,610 --> 00:19:33,060
The world's smallest violin.

326
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:38,170
What are you talking about?

327
00:19:46,690 --> 00:19:49,100
They're gone, Charlie.

328
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:52,880
Are you sure? Check under the bed.

329
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:57,720
All clear.

330
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:59,850
Okay.

331
00:19:59,850 --> 00:20:01,260
I wonder why they left.

332
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:04,530
Maybe because we stopped feeding them.

333
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:07,150
Whoa, check it out.

334
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:11,590
Wow.

335
00:20:11,590 --> 00:20:14,510
- You know what this means, don't you?
- Yeah.

336
00:20:14,510 --> 00:20:16,920
Breakfast.
