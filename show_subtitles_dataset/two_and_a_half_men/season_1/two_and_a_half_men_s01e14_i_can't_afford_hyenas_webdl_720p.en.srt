1
00:00:01,766 --> 00:00:04,701
Dad, without action, there's no juice.

2
00:00:05,603 --> 00:00:07,798
All of a sudden he's Frank Sinatra.

3
00:00:08,406 --> 00:00:10,465
- I bet that's the pizza.
- What's the spread?

4
00:00:10,575 --> 00:00:11,974
Pepperoni.

5
00:00:14,312 --> 00:00:17,145
What's next, Charlie?
You gonna teach him how to shoot craps?

6
00:00:17,248 --> 00:00:18,806
He already knows how to shoot craps.

7
00:00:18,916 --> 00:00:22,113
I just wish I could teach him
not to bet the hard eight.

8
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:27,113
Mr. Harper, here you go, nice and hot.
I threw in some extra garlic puffs as well.

9
00:00:27,225 --> 00:00:28,658
Thanks, pal.

10
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:30,420
Thank you, Mr. Harper.

11
00:00:30,494 --> 00:00:32,962
If there's anything at all you ever need,
please call.

12
00:00:33,064 --> 00:00:35,965
You know, pizza, dry-cleaning,
pot, women.

13
00:00:37,902 --> 00:00:41,167
- How much did you tip him?
- I don't know, I gave him $50.

14
00:00:41,272 --> 00:00:43,433
That's like a 300ºº tip.

15
00:00:43,507 --> 00:00:45,737
If you say so. I was never good at math.

16
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:48,802
Yeah, but you can figure out
the point spread, the over-under

17
00:00:48,913 --> 00:00:51,473
and the vigorish
on every football game in the country.

18
00:00:51,582 --> 00:00:54,312
What can I tell you?
I've got a beautiful mind.

19
00:01:04,562 --> 00:01:07,224
Morning, Berta. Need some help?

20
00:01:07,298 --> 00:01:09,858
Yeah. Come to my house
and explain to my daughter

21
00:01:09,934 --> 00:01:13,927
that we don't put up bail for cute guys
with Costa Rican passports.

22
00:01:14,706 --> 00:01:16,901
- Morning.
- I got your groceries, Charlie.

23
00:01:16,975 --> 00:01:18,465
You owe me $74.

24
00:01:18,576 --> 00:01:21,636
- Why didn't you just use my credit card?
- I tried.

25
00:01:21,746 --> 00:01:23,213
Funny story.

26
00:01:27,318 --> 00:01:29,218
My platinum card.

27
00:01:30,088 --> 00:01:32,488
Look what they did to my platinum card.

28
00:01:32,924 --> 00:01:35,654
They decapitated my holographic eagle.

29
00:01:36,494 --> 00:01:39,327
Yeah, that's sad. You owe me $74.

30
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:41,421
Relax, I'll write you a check.

31
00:01:43,935 --> 00:01:45,596
Berta, I'm good for $74.

32
00:01:45,703 --> 00:01:49,264
There's an assistant store manager
with bad skin and a pair of scissors

33
00:01:49,374 --> 00:01:50,739
who begs to differ.

34
00:01:50,909 --> 00:01:55,073
He obviously made a mistake.
Leave it to me, I'll straighten it out.

35
00:01:57,215 --> 00:01:58,876
Alan, what do I do?

36
00:01:59,217 --> 00:02:02,380
Call the bank that issued the card
and figure out what's going on.

37
00:02:02,453 --> 00:02:03,613
Good idea.

38
00:02:05,823 --> 00:02:07,723
How do I get the number?

39
00:02:07,825 --> 00:02:10,157
It's usually on the back of the card.

40
00:02:14,599 --> 00:02:16,897
Okay, this may take a while.

41
00:02:19,938 --> 00:02:21,428
Are you sure?

42
00:02:21,773 --> 00:02:23,263
Okay, thanks.

43
00:02:24,075 --> 00:02:25,633
I don't believe it.

44
00:02:26,177 --> 00:02:28,407
None of my bills have been paid
in four months.

45
00:02:28,479 --> 00:02:31,107
My credit is shot. All my cards are dead.

46
00:02:31,182 --> 00:02:33,582
You don't have to worry
about paying me this week.

47
00:02:33,685 --> 00:02:34,811
Thank you, Berta.

48
00:02:34,919 --> 00:02:38,116
I'll just take this espresso maker
and be on my way.

49
00:02:39,324 --> 00:02:41,519
Call me when things pick up.

50
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:45,090
Charlie, why haven't you been
paying your bills?

51
00:02:45,163 --> 00:02:48,326
Alan, I don't pay my own bills.
I've got a guy.

52
00:02:48,433 --> 00:02:50,526
Do you think you might want
to call your guy?

53
00:02:50,635 --> 00:02:52,967
Don't talk down to me, Alan.
I'm not stupid.

54
00:02:53,037 --> 00:02:54,504
That's the first call I made.

55
00:02:54,606 --> 00:02:56,665
- And?
- And

56
00:02:57,508 --> 00:03:00,375
his number is not in service at this time.

57
00:03:05,883 --> 00:03:07,714
Wonderful building.

58
00:03:08,286 --> 00:03:09,514
What's wrong with it?

59
00:03:09,621 --> 00:03:12,681
The phrase "reeks of urine"
comes to mind.

60
00:03:19,063 --> 00:03:20,394
Here we are.

61
00:03:21,899 --> 00:03:23,696
That's seldom a good sign.

62
00:03:26,971 --> 00:03:29,667
- Hello, Stan?
- Who wants to know?

63
00:03:30,508 --> 00:03:32,169
It's Charlie Harper.

64
00:03:33,678 --> 00:03:36,738
Charlie! Good to see you. Come on in.

65
00:03:36,848 --> 00:03:39,248
Just don't rip the tape, they check.

66
00:03:40,351 --> 00:03:42,649
So what's going on?
What can I do you for?

67
00:03:42,754 --> 00:03:44,551
Stan, I've got a problem.

68
00:03:45,056 --> 00:03:47,047
Yeah, I know the feeling.

69
00:03:47,492 --> 00:03:50,052
Sit down, talk to me. Come on.

70
00:03:51,329 --> 00:03:54,059
All of my credit cards are dead.

71
00:03:54,165 --> 00:03:57,601
And they tell me the bills
haven't been paid in four months.

72
00:03:58,202 --> 00:04:00,397
Yeah, that sounds about right.

73
00:04:03,074 --> 00:04:05,508
Excuse me,
maybe this is none of my business,

74
00:04:05,576 --> 00:04:07,567
but how does something like that happen?

75
00:04:07,679 --> 00:04:10,409
In layman's terms,
your brother ran out of money.

76
00:04:10,515 --> 00:04:13,006
What? How did I run out of money?

77
00:04:13,084 --> 00:04:15,177
I knew you'd ask that.

78
00:04:17,088 --> 00:04:18,851
Let me demonstrate.

79
00:04:19,757 --> 00:04:21,554
Think of this water as cash flow,

80
00:04:21,626 --> 00:04:24,686
which, for you, would be
royalties from your jingles, right?

81
00:04:24,762 --> 00:04:28,630
And this cup, your financial well-being.

82
00:04:30,134 --> 00:04:31,692
This little hole

83
00:04:33,705 --> 00:04:36,970
would be your expenses. You dig?

84
00:04:37,608 --> 00:04:40,736
Now, Charlie, with most people,

85
00:04:41,813 --> 00:04:43,542
when money comes in,

86
00:04:44,816 --> 00:04:47,614
it drips out and pays their bills

87
00:04:47,719 --> 00:04:51,280
with a healthy reserve for emergencies.

88
00:04:54,325 --> 00:04:58,591
But with you, however...
This is what I love about you, Charlie.

89
00:05:05,403 --> 00:05:08,895
You spend it as quick as you get it.

90
00:05:09,307 --> 00:05:11,502
You see, you don't drip,

91
00:05:13,411 --> 00:05:14,844
you hemorrhage.

92
00:05:19,083 --> 00:05:20,448
Look at that.

93
00:05:20,518 --> 00:05:24,181
But when the cash flow
starts to slow down,

94
00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:27,822
there's no reserve.

95
00:05:28,659 --> 00:05:29,819
Okay.

96
00:05:30,928 --> 00:05:32,862
But what happened to my money?

97
00:05:34,031 --> 00:05:37,489
Artists. Where would we be
without them?

98
00:05:39,203 --> 00:05:42,661
What I don't understand is why
you didn't warn him this was happening.

99
00:05:42,774 --> 00:05:44,469
Okay, mea culpa.

100
00:05:45,209 --> 00:05:49,805
Look, I've been a little distracted lately.
Slight problem with the feds.

101
00:05:50,348 --> 00:05:52,179
Are you embezzling from my brother?

102
00:05:52,283 --> 00:05:55,218
Embezzle what? Hello!

103
00:05:56,487 --> 00:05:58,114
I thought you were the smart one.

104
00:05:58,189 --> 00:06:01,215
No, this is a totally unrelated,

105
00:06:01,325 --> 00:06:03,987
import-export problem, all right?

106
00:06:04,695 --> 00:06:09,359
I just cannot believe that one of
the piñatas showed up at a kids' party.

107
00:06:12,203 --> 00:06:13,670
Oh, boy.

108
00:06:13,971 --> 00:06:16,201
This has been a blast.
Don't get me wrong,

109
00:06:16,307 --> 00:06:19,799
but I have a plane to catch right now.

110
00:06:20,178 --> 00:06:24,842
I'll tell you what, just feel free
and browse through all your files.

111
00:06:25,349 --> 00:06:29,479
Listen, Charlie, I'm running a little short
on cash, so maybe you...

112
00:06:29,554 --> 00:06:32,887
Look who I'm asking!

113
00:06:33,090 --> 00:06:35,820
It was great meeting you, sport. Ciao.

114
00:06:44,569 --> 00:06:46,264
And you were worried.

115
00:06:54,846 --> 00:06:57,872
The good news is
that a substantial amount of royalties

116
00:06:57,949 --> 00:07:00,076
is gonna come in
in the next couple of months.

117
00:07:00,184 --> 00:07:02,709
Great. Problem solved.
Let's go out to dinner.

118
00:07:02,787 --> 00:07:05,620
- No, problem not solved.
- But I'm hungry.

119
00:07:06,224 --> 00:07:07,714
Get used to it.

120
00:07:08,759 --> 00:07:12,718
It's going to take a while to pay off
all the bills your accountant ignored,

121
00:07:12,797 --> 00:07:14,856
so until then,
you're gonna have to cut back.

122
00:07:14,932 --> 00:07:18,561
- But you said I got money coming.
- Shall I go get the paper cup?

123
00:07:20,304 --> 00:07:22,238
Okay. What do we cut?

124
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:24,540
Let's look at your expenses.

125
00:07:24,609 --> 00:07:27,373
First thing is,
we stop paying your accountant.

126
00:07:27,445 --> 00:07:29,936
That's a little cold, isn't it?

127
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:33,539
He's great, I've known him for years.
He's going through a rough patch.

128
00:07:33,618 --> 00:07:36,485
- Charlie, you're broke.
- You're right, screw him.

129
00:07:36,587 --> 00:07:37,713
What's next?

130
00:07:37,788 --> 00:07:40,154
You have a gardener.
Why do you have a gardener?

131
00:07:40,258 --> 00:07:41,953
To tend my garden.

132
00:07:42,727 --> 00:07:46,094
Garden? You mean the two potted palms
on the deck?

133
00:07:47,231 --> 00:07:48,425
Water them yourself.

134
00:07:48,499 --> 00:07:52,458
Okay, but I'm gonna have to buy a hose
and one of those watering things,

135
00:07:52,570 --> 00:07:55,061
so isn't that kind of a push?

136
00:07:55,606 --> 00:07:58,666
Gone. Now,
"Ultimate Premiere Satellite package"?

137
00:07:58,809 --> 00:08:02,301
That's really cool.
I get every sporting event in the world.

138
00:08:02,413 --> 00:08:06,941
If a kid in Madagascar throws a rock
at a tree, I can see it and bet on it.

139
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:09,284
It's gone.

140
00:08:09,353 --> 00:08:12,186
Oh, man.
We can keep the cable, though, right?

141
00:08:12,290 --> 00:08:14,019
You have satellite and cable?

142
00:08:14,125 --> 00:08:16,457
Sometimes there's solar flares.

143
00:08:16,594 --> 00:08:18,619
Okay, we can cut back to basic cable.

144
00:08:18,696 --> 00:08:22,029
Basic cable?
That's what they get in prison.

145
00:08:25,436 --> 00:08:28,098
- Hey, what you doing?
- Bad time, Rose.

146
00:08:28,172 --> 00:08:30,003
Money problems?

147
00:08:30,775 --> 00:08:34,040
- How did you know?
- I bought your espresso maker from Berta.

148
00:08:34,145 --> 00:08:37,808
I got a great deal 'cause she didn't want
to carry it on the bus.

149
00:08:37,882 --> 00:08:39,042
Wonderful.

150
00:08:39,183 --> 00:08:43,483
Charlie, "miscellaneous cash expenses"?
What exactly is that?

151
00:08:44,288 --> 00:08:47,951
I don't know. Go see a movie,
buy a hot dog, stuff like that.

152
00:08:48,025 --> 00:08:50,016
It was $80,000 last year.

153
00:08:51,696 --> 00:08:54,790
That. That's women and gambling.

154
00:08:56,167 --> 00:08:58,101
Gone and gone.

155
00:08:58,769 --> 00:09:01,499
Great. Why don't I just shoot myself?

156
00:09:01,605 --> 00:09:03,596
You can't afford a gun.

157
00:09:04,942 --> 00:09:07,103
You know,
I could lend you some money, Charlie.

158
00:09:07,178 --> 00:09:10,875
That's very sweet, Rose,
but I don't really want to shoot myself.

159
00:09:10,982 --> 00:09:13,974
The way I see it, you're either gonna
have to slash expenses,

160
00:09:14,051 --> 00:09:16,383
or find the money to pay your bills
someplace else.

161
00:09:16,487 --> 00:09:17,852
Okay.

162
00:09:18,389 --> 00:09:21,381
- I'll borrow on the house.
- You've already got three mortgages.

163
00:09:21,492 --> 00:09:24,188
- Is that a lot?
- Not if you have three houses.

164
00:09:24,962 --> 00:09:26,827
Let me ask you a tough question.

165
00:09:26,897 --> 00:09:30,890
What would you think about going
to Mom for a short-term loan?

166
00:09:32,169 --> 00:09:33,898
Interesting idea.

167
00:09:34,538 --> 00:09:38,736
I think I'd rather have a pack of hyenas
tear out and devour my intestines.

168
00:09:40,011 --> 00:09:42,809
Yeah, I know. I can't afford hyenas.

169
00:09:43,914 --> 00:09:46,041
Look, you know I'd help you if I could,

170
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:49,051
but all my money's going
to my former wife, my former house,

171
00:09:49,153 --> 00:09:52,316
my former wife's current lawyers
and all their descendants.

172
00:09:52,390 --> 00:09:54,051
So if you don't want to go to Mom,

173
00:09:54,158 --> 00:09:57,025
you're gonna have to change your lifestyle
for a few months.

174
00:09:57,094 --> 00:09:58,618
Fine. You win.

175
00:09:58,896 --> 00:10:02,229
I win? What do I win?
How is this a win for me?

176
00:10:02,333 --> 00:10:04,494
Whatever. I'll cut back, like you said.

177
00:10:04,568 --> 00:10:07,662
Now come on, let's all go out
for a nice dinner. I'm buying.

178
00:10:07,738 --> 00:10:11,196
Great. Then after we can stop by my place
for espresso.

179
00:10:11,675 --> 00:10:14,735
Good idea. That's a money saver.

180
00:10:20,912 --> 00:10:24,279
"Save 50 cents on one regular-sized
Hamburger Helper

181
00:10:24,382 --> 00:10:27,545
"when you buy two of the following
10.5 ounce... "

182
00:10:27,619 --> 00:10:28,950
Screw it.

183
00:10:36,361 --> 00:10:38,261
- Hi.
- Hi.

184
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:41,021
How do you like that cabernet?

185
00:10:41,766 --> 00:10:44,929
- It's very good.
- I'll have to try it sometime.

186
00:10:45,036 --> 00:10:48,870
And excuse me for saying so, but you
really don't need the Lean Cuisine.

187
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:50,407
Thank you.

188
00:10:51,042 --> 00:10:53,533
So, how do you like this

189
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:56,774
cheese?

190
00:10:57,148 --> 00:10:58,240
That.

191
00:10:58,316 --> 00:11:02,412
I do a little volunteer work making
sandwiches for a homeless shelter.

192
00:11:05,457 --> 00:11:08,893
I don't know if you know this,
but a lot of those homeless fellas

193
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:11,224
like a little snort once in awhile.

194
00:11:12,664 --> 00:11:14,996
Okay. Seek and ye shall find.

195
00:11:15,099 --> 00:11:17,761
Twenty-four rolls of toilet paper for $3.99.

196
00:11:17,836 --> 00:11:19,701
I know what you're thinking,
it's single-ply,

197
00:11:19,771 --> 00:11:23,036
but at this price, you can double up,
triple up, go wild!

198
00:11:24,108 --> 00:11:26,099
Okay, have a nice day.

199
00:11:27,178 --> 00:11:29,612
I can't do this anymore, Alan. I quit.

200
00:11:29,681 --> 00:11:31,842
You can't quit poverty, Charlie.

201
00:11:33,685 --> 00:11:35,243
I want the good stuff.

202
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:39,381
I want cheese that isn't air-dropped
into third-world countries.

203
00:11:39,457 --> 00:11:41,755
I want ouchless toilet paper.

204
00:11:43,094 --> 00:11:47,394
I want vodka that doesn't look like
Fred Flintstone would drink it.

205
00:11:48,566 --> 00:11:50,466
I want my life back.

206
00:11:50,568 --> 00:11:55,005
Fine, then swallow your pride, call Mom,
and ask her to lend you some money.

207
00:12:00,311 --> 00:12:01,938
Yabba-dabba-doo.

208
00:12:05,416 --> 00:12:07,111
Who's the favorite?

209
00:12:07,318 --> 00:12:09,582
- Green Bay.
- Did you bet them?

210
00:12:09,654 --> 00:12:10,746
No.

211
00:12:11,856 --> 00:12:13,517
You took the Redskins?

212
00:12:14,425 --> 00:12:16,359
- No action?
- None.

213
00:12:18,263 --> 00:12:21,494
- Then why are we watching?
- Beats the hell out of me.

214
00:12:23,201 --> 00:12:24,862
Anybody want a snack?

215
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:27,360
Pizza's here.

216
00:12:27,605 --> 00:12:29,436
You ordered a pizza?

217
00:12:30,341 --> 00:12:32,969
Charlie, you're supposed to be
cutting back on expenses.

218
00:12:33,044 --> 00:12:35,535
Alan, it's a pizza, not a hooker.

219
00:12:38,883 --> 00:12:40,646
Hey, Mr. Harper. Good to see you.

220
00:12:40,718 --> 00:12:43,016
I threw in
some of those garlic puffs you like.

221
00:12:43,121 --> 00:12:46,318
Grabbed a bottle of house red.
I don't think they'll miss it.

222
00:12:46,391 --> 00:12:49,360
Thanks, buddy. Here's for the pizza and...

223
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:50,688
Charlie.

224
00:12:50,795 --> 00:12:52,956
Can I speak with you for a minute?

225
00:12:55,133 --> 00:12:56,657
Hang on a sec.

226
00:12:58,036 --> 00:13:00,527
- What are you planning on tipping him?
- I don't know.

227
00:13:00,638 --> 00:13:02,663
Give him $2. That's 15ºº.

228
00:13:02,774 --> 00:13:04,799
- I can't do that.
- You have to.

229
00:13:18,823 --> 00:13:21,053
I can't. Did you see his face?

230
00:13:21,626 --> 00:13:22,820
Go.

231
00:13:26,564 --> 00:13:29,124
- There you go.
- Thank you, Mr. Harper.

232
00:13:30,501 --> 00:13:32,128
These are ones.

233
00:13:32,470 --> 00:13:33,630
Yeah.

234
00:13:34,238 --> 00:13:36,206
I can break $100.

235
00:13:36,307 --> 00:13:40,300
Yeah, I'm having
kind of a cash flow problem.

236
00:13:40,878 --> 00:13:43,506
Yeah. Well, we had a good run.

237
00:13:46,417 --> 00:13:47,714
Wait.

238
00:13:49,554 --> 00:13:51,647
- Here.
- No, keep it.

239
00:13:51,756 --> 00:13:53,587
You need it more than I do.

240
00:13:57,662 --> 00:14:01,325
So, Deborah said that Julie had
an addiction to cosmetic procedures.

241
00:14:01,399 --> 00:14:05,028
And I said, "Well, then she needs to go
to BOTOX detox. "

242
00:14:06,337 --> 00:14:07,827
Everyone laughed and laughed,

243
00:14:07,905 --> 00:14:11,898
but, of course, you couldn't tell
'cause none of their faces were moving.

244
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:14,175
That's pretty funny, Mom.

245
00:14:14,879 --> 00:14:16,039
Listen...

246
00:14:16,314 --> 00:14:18,407
Right. You wanted to tell me something.

247
00:14:18,516 --> 00:14:21,212
Yeah. Maybe you should sit down.

248
00:14:22,253 --> 00:14:25,347
What now? You got some girl pregnant?

249
00:14:26,090 --> 00:14:28,149
You're gay? You're on drugs?

250
00:14:28,226 --> 00:14:29,989
$10 says pregnant.

251
00:14:30,762 --> 00:14:32,730
- Jake, go to your room.
- I'm giving odds.

252
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:33,990
Go.

253
00:14:35,733 --> 00:14:38,065
Okay. Here's the thing.

254
00:14:41,873 --> 00:14:43,204
Would you like a drink?

255
00:14:43,274 --> 00:14:45,902
I suppose. A screwdriver might be nice.

256
00:14:50,114 --> 00:14:51,775
I can't go through with this, Alan.

257
00:14:51,883 --> 00:14:54,408
Sure you can. She'll make
a couple of snide comments

258
00:14:54,519 --> 00:14:58,216
about your frivolous lifestyle, which
luckily, she doesn't know the half of.

259
00:14:58,289 --> 00:15:02,191
You'll just suck it up, pay her back
in a couple of months and that'll be that.

260
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:06,128
With Mom, "that" is never "that. "
The guilt is always there.

261
00:15:06,364 --> 00:15:09,561
To this day, she still reminds me
how much she had to sacrifice

262
00:15:09,634 --> 00:15:11,397
just so I could get braces.

263
00:15:11,469 --> 00:15:15,769
Like I deliberately had crooked teeth
so she'd be forced to drive a domestic car.

264
00:15:16,007 --> 00:15:18,532
- All right, then just drop it.
- It's dropped.

265
00:15:18,609 --> 00:15:19,701
- Don't ask her.
- I won't.

266
00:15:19,777 --> 00:15:20,869
- Let it go.
- It's gone.

267
00:15:20,945 --> 00:15:23,277
By the way,
they're about to repossess your Jaguar.

268
00:15:23,381 --> 00:15:24,712
Mommy?

269
00:15:28,352 --> 00:15:29,683
Very nice.

270
00:15:31,355 --> 00:15:32,754
So, how much do you need?

271
00:15:32,857 --> 00:15:35,758
I admit that my lifestyle
has been a little frivolous

272
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:39,261
and I probably should have been
paying closer attention to my expenses.

273
00:15:39,363 --> 00:15:41,126
All right. How much do you need?

274
00:15:41,232 --> 00:15:44,099
This is just a temporary thing,
couple of months.

275
00:15:44,202 --> 00:15:46,102
- How much?
- You'll get it back.

276
00:15:46,204 --> 00:15:49,401
This isn't like the braces
and the Mercury Capri.

277
00:15:49,707 --> 00:15:52,039
Charlie, give me a number.

278
00:16:10,061 --> 00:16:11,551
I really appreciate this, Mom.

279
00:16:11,629 --> 00:16:13,995
No more need be said.

280
00:16:15,133 --> 00:16:17,124
You'll pay it back when you can.

281
00:16:17,235 --> 00:16:18,395
Thanks.

282
00:16:18,669 --> 00:16:23,003
All right. Now that that's taken care of,
why don't I take my boys out to dinner?

283
00:16:23,107 --> 00:16:24,472
There it is!

284
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:27,305
Everything's got a price.

285
00:16:28,379 --> 00:16:29,869
- Charlie, what are you...
- No.

286
00:16:29,947 --> 00:16:33,075
She can't just do something nice,
there's gotta be strings attached.

287
00:16:33,151 --> 00:16:36,245
Nothing's given out of love.
Everything's got a hook in it!

288
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:39,619
You can keep your money, lady,
because I'm a free man,

289
00:16:39,724 --> 00:16:41,658
and I can't be bought.

290
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:46,257
Now if you'll excuse me,
I have to go hide my car.

291
00:17:01,746 --> 00:17:04,510
They're gonna take my Jag away

292
00:17:08,419 --> 00:17:11,149
Charlie, can I talk to you for a minute?

293
00:17:11,923 --> 00:17:13,220
I guess.

294
00:17:18,262 --> 00:17:19,991
How come it's so dark in here?

295
00:17:20,097 --> 00:17:22,588
Do you have any idea how much
electricity costs?

296
00:17:22,667 --> 00:17:23,793
No.

297
00:17:23,901 --> 00:17:27,234
I didn't, either,
but it turns out it's quite a racket.

298
00:17:27,805 --> 00:17:28,897
Listen.

299
00:17:28,973 --> 00:17:32,568
I know you're going through a tough time
and I really wanna help you out.

300
00:17:32,643 --> 00:17:35,009
So, please take this.

301
00:17:38,249 --> 00:17:42,276
This is a cashier's check.
Where did you get a cashier's check?

302
00:17:42,353 --> 00:17:44,480
From my dad's bank, silly.

303
00:17:45,456 --> 00:17:47,287
Your dad owns a bank?

304
00:17:47,959 --> 00:17:52,589
Not all by himself.
Me and my brother and sister own 49ºº.

305
00:17:53,331 --> 00:17:54,628
Really?

306
00:17:56,534 --> 00:17:57,796
What about your mom?

307
00:17:58,002 --> 00:17:59,594
She doesn't have a bank.

308
00:17:59,670 --> 00:18:01,638
- I see.
- She's in oil.

309
00:18:06,510 --> 00:18:09,707
- So you really have...
- Yep, more than God.

310
00:18:11,682 --> 00:18:14,446
Didn't figure that when you dumped me,
did you?

311
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:17,845
Rose, it wouldn't have mattered.

312
00:18:17,955 --> 00:18:21,789
I know.
That's one of the things I love about you.

313
00:18:21,859 --> 00:18:25,124
You discard women
regardless of their financial status.

314
00:18:27,932 --> 00:18:30,799
Thanks. But I can't take this.

315
00:18:30,868 --> 00:18:33,268
You think I'm crazy, don't you?

316
00:18:35,339 --> 00:18:37,330
My dad and brother said I was crazy,

317
00:18:37,441 --> 00:18:42,344
but I think that was to form a power block
to squeeze me off the Board of Directors.

318
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:44,304
Shame on them.

319
00:18:46,784 --> 00:18:49,685
I told them that you'd help me
if I needed it.

320
00:18:49,787 --> 00:18:53,621
I mean, you're the first guy I've ever met
who hasn't cared about my money.

321
00:18:53,691 --> 00:18:57,627
Who slept with me because he was drunk,
not because I was rich.

322
00:19:01,699 --> 00:19:05,863
I only wanted to help you
because I thought that we were friends.

323
00:19:06,370 --> 00:19:09,066
Maybe I was wrong. Maybe I am crazy.

324
00:19:09,173 --> 00:19:13,303
No, Rose, it's fine. I am your friend.

325
00:19:13,377 --> 00:19:16,505
And if it means that much to you,
I'll take the money.

326
00:19:18,482 --> 00:19:21,576
Thank you, Charlie.
How can I ever repay you?

327
00:19:23,521 --> 00:19:26,513
Don't worry about it.
And I will pay you back.

328
00:19:26,590 --> 00:19:27,818
I know that.

329
00:19:27,892 --> 00:19:31,885
Better I should owe you
than my manipulating, scheming mother.

330
00:19:32,763 --> 00:19:35,960
That's the nicest thing
you've ever said to me.

331
00:19:36,467 --> 00:19:38,833
Hang on, I'll grab you a tissue.

332
00:19:38,903 --> 00:19:40,302
Thank you.

333
00:20:16,107 --> 00:20:17,301
English
