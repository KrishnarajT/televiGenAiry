1
00:00:01,435 --> 00:00:04,461
Hey, Judith. There's the rock star.
Ready for a fun weekend?

2
00:00:04,538 --> 00:00:06,130
Leave me alone.

3
00:00:07,841 --> 00:00:09,206
Musicians.

4
00:00:09,643 --> 00:00:12,635
Alan, that child is driving me insane.

5
00:00:12,713 --> 00:00:14,647
Like father like son, huh?

6
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:17,540
Really, that bad?

7
00:00:18,152 --> 00:00:22,213
He's been sullen and uncooperative for
days. I think he needs to see someone.

8
00:00:22,322 --> 00:00:23,983
What, you mean like a shrink?

9
00:00:24,058 --> 00:00:26,253
No, Alan, I mean like a blacksmith.

10
00:00:27,728 --> 00:00:29,923
This is clearly a reaction to our divorce.

11
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:33,193
He's not processing his emotions
in a healthy way,

12
00:00:33,267 --> 00:00:35,531
and I think therapy
could help unblock him.

13
00:00:35,602 --> 00:00:38,196
- Where did you get that?
- From my therapist.

14
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:42,035
Who's working wonders with you.

15
00:00:42,109 --> 00:00:43,508
Excuse me?

16
00:00:43,777 --> 00:00:46,075
Who's working wonders with you.

17
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:53,886
All he does is sit in his room and play
that damn thing. He's isolating, Alan.

18
00:00:53,954 --> 00:00:55,888
That doesn't mean
he needs to see a therapist.

19
00:00:55,956 --> 00:00:59,016
He's a normal 11-year-old kid
who happens to be a little grumpy.

20
00:00:59,093 --> 00:01:02,358
And I'm a normal 35-year-old mother
who is running out of patience.

21
00:01:02,429 --> 00:01:04,420
And by patience I mean Prozac.

22
00:01:05,899 --> 00:01:09,096
Wait a minute.
You can't still be 35, because...

23
00:01:11,738 --> 00:01:14,104
He's getting pretty good at that.

24
00:01:14,708 --> 00:01:17,074
Yeah, well get used to it.

25
00:01:39,733 --> 00:01:42,497
Charlie, what are you doing?

26
00:01:44,605 --> 00:01:46,163
Smoke on the Water.

27
00:02:22,689 --> 00:02:23,951
Okay.

28
00:02:25,191 --> 00:02:27,125
It's not cute anymore.

29
00:02:29,295 --> 00:02:30,956
Make him stop.

30
00:02:31,031 --> 00:02:33,966
You're the one who bought him
the guitar, Charlie.

31
00:02:34,367 --> 00:02:38,360
The bed is vibrating so much up there
I'm no longer necessary.

32
00:02:39,406 --> 00:02:43,342
Well, I'm sorry my son's interrupted
your afternoon debauchery,

33
00:02:43,743 --> 00:02:45,836
but I think he's upset about something.

34
00:02:45,912 --> 00:02:47,504
- What's he upset about?
- I don't know.

35
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:50,413
I was just giving him a little space
before I talked to him.

36
00:02:50,517 --> 00:02:52,348
You want me to talk to him?

37
00:02:53,553 --> 00:02:56,147
Sure, and I'll finish for you upstairs.

38
00:02:57,891 --> 00:02:59,586
This is a father's job.

39
00:03:02,062 --> 00:03:05,225
Tell him I just need, like, 20 minutes.

40
00:03:22,348 --> 00:03:23,940
Can I come in?

41
00:03:29,255 --> 00:03:32,349
It really sounds like
you've got your mojo working.

42
00:03:35,361 --> 00:03:39,798
But let's try to turn it down now, okay?

43
00:03:41,067 --> 00:03:42,694
What'd you do that for?

44
00:03:42,769 --> 00:03:46,068
Because I love you,
and I don't want that to change.

45
00:03:50,443 --> 00:03:53,105
So how was your week?

46
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:55,413
Okay.

47
00:03:55,482 --> 00:03:57,473
Anything I need to know?

48
00:03:57,584 --> 00:03:59,882
- Anything bothering you?
- No.

49
00:03:59,953 --> 00:04:02,751
You sure? 'Cause it seems like
something's bothering you.

50
00:04:02,822 --> 00:04:04,722
Okay, you wanna know
what's bothering me?

51
00:04:04,791 --> 00:04:06,122
Yeah.

52
00:04:06,226 --> 00:04:08,888
People keep on asking me
what's bothering me.

53
00:04:11,097 --> 00:04:13,725
- Okay. I won't ask.
- Good.

54
00:04:16,269 --> 00:04:18,794
- You know, when I was your age...
- Oh, man!

55
00:04:20,406 --> 00:04:22,431
Okay, forget that.

56
00:04:22,509 --> 00:04:24,477
- Problems at school?
- No.

57
00:04:24,577 --> 00:04:26,306
- Problems with Mom?
- No.

58
00:04:26,412 --> 00:04:29,347
Because I understand there's some
things a guy doesn't want to

59
00:04:29,449 --> 00:04:31,974
- talk with his mom about.
- Like what?

60
00:04:32,085 --> 00:04:36,454
Well, you know, girl problems,
or somebody's picking on you.

61
00:04:36,523 --> 00:04:40,653
Or you're the only guy in gym class
without hair on his testicles.

62
00:04:51,871 --> 00:04:53,930
She sobered up on you, huh?

63
00:04:58,778 --> 00:05:01,941
No, I'm just being a good host.
And, yeah, a little bit.

64
00:05:03,983 --> 00:05:06,713
- Man.
- Did you figure out what his problem is?

65
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:09,687
No, but we determined mine
was late-onset puberty.

66
00:05:11,324 --> 00:05:14,020
You were a Mexican hairless, weren't you?

67
00:05:17,497 --> 00:05:19,727
Did you check to see if he's constipated?

68
00:05:19,833 --> 00:05:22,131
His mother and I
are going through a divorce,

69
00:05:22,202 --> 00:05:24,500
and there's a lot of emotions
he hasn't processed.

70
00:05:24,571 --> 00:05:28,530
Maybe so, but there's also a lot of
string cheese he hasn't processed.

71
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:34,337
You know, Judith thinks
he needs to see a therapist.

72
00:05:34,414 --> 00:05:36,905
Why, 'cause it's working so good for her?

73
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:39,409
Charlie, that's uncalled for.

74
00:05:39,853 --> 00:05:42,845
Come on. The kid's problem is he's 11.

75
00:05:43,189 --> 00:05:47,250
He can't drive, he can't drink,
and his mother picks out all his clothes.

76
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:51,321
Be thankful he's not in the garage
biting the heads off of chickens.

77
00:05:51,397 --> 00:05:53,160
But this isn't like him.

78
00:05:53,233 --> 00:05:55,167
Trust your first instinct.

79
00:05:55,735 --> 00:05:59,501
Just give him a little space,
and probably by this time tomorrow...

80
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:05,610
I will have killed him.

81
00:06:23,863 --> 00:06:28,027
Not bad. But why don't you try fretting
the "E" and the "A" string together?

82
00:06:28,201 --> 00:06:29,691
I like my way.

83
00:06:30,637 --> 00:06:32,036
Cool.

84
00:06:36,309 --> 00:06:38,300
What did you do that for?

85
00:06:38,411 --> 00:06:41,209
Look, I'm really happy you've taken up
an instrument,

86
00:06:41,281 --> 00:06:44,444
and I'll be even happier
when you learn an actual song.

87
00:06:45,084 --> 00:06:48,520
But right now, let's just take a little pause
for the cause.

88
00:06:49,756 --> 00:06:51,246
What do you want?

89
00:06:51,324 --> 00:06:53,849
Nothing. I just thought we could hang out.

90
00:06:57,630 --> 00:07:00,098
A couple of musicians taking five.

91
00:07:03,536 --> 00:07:04,867
Just chilling.

92
00:07:06,139 --> 00:07:08,164
Nothing's bothering me.

93
00:07:08,274 --> 00:07:11,539
That's cool. I'm not trying to harsh
your mellow.

94
00:07:14,113 --> 00:07:18,140
I know there are certain things a guy
doesn't want to talk to his parents about.

95
00:07:18,217 --> 00:07:20,378
- Like what?
- I don't know.

96
00:07:20,653 --> 00:07:22,644
Peer pressure. Bullies.

97
00:07:23,323 --> 00:07:26,884
Skipping class to drive to Tijuana
with the school nurse.

98
00:07:32,565 --> 00:07:37,468
I'm telling you, my youngest once ate
a whole can of Play-Doh.

99
00:07:38,538 --> 00:07:40,631
Stopped her up for two weeks.

100
00:07:40,707 --> 00:07:41,867
Berta, please.

101
00:07:41,975 --> 00:07:44,409
Finally, pooped out an ashtray.

102
00:07:45,912 --> 00:07:48,005
That's the day I quit smoking.

103
00:07:53,886 --> 00:07:55,217
Any luck?

104
00:07:56,155 --> 00:07:58,851
The little snothead kicked me
out of his room.

105
00:07:59,058 --> 00:08:00,355
Welcome to the club.

106
00:08:00,426 --> 00:08:02,223
Yeah, but I'm the cool uncle.

107
00:08:02,328 --> 00:08:04,523
And I'm the uncool dad?

108
00:08:04,597 --> 00:08:07,430
Don't get defensive.
You did the best you could.

109
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:10,391
That kid has nothing to complain about.

110
00:08:10,503 --> 00:08:13,233
He's never been spanked,
he's never even been yelled at.

111
00:08:13,339 --> 00:08:16,900
And even while my marriage was
collapsing, he always came first.

112
00:08:17,010 --> 00:08:19,171
Well, I'm glad you're not defensive.

113
00:08:19,245 --> 00:08:21,873
He has a great life.
He gets everything he wants,

114
00:08:21,948 --> 00:08:25,714
I deny him nothing. Oh, my God,
what have I done to my son?

115
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:29,386
Alan, I was kidding. You're a terrific father.

116
00:08:29,455 --> 00:08:31,184
- You think so?
- Yes, I do.

117
00:08:31,257 --> 00:08:33,623
You're right. I'm always too quick
to blame myself.

118
00:08:33,726 --> 00:08:35,421
- Yes, you are.
- It's his mother's fault.

119
00:08:35,528 --> 00:08:36,790
Attaboy!

120
00:08:41,467 --> 00:08:43,560
Would you like me
to make you a snack, Jake?

121
00:08:43,636 --> 00:08:45,263
I'm not hungry.

122
00:08:45,371 --> 00:08:47,566
You sure?
We've got some pizza left from dinner.

123
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:49,972
Alan, ease up. He said he's not hungry.

124
00:08:50,076 --> 00:08:51,634
You'll eat when you want to, right?

125
00:08:51,744 --> 00:08:54,474
Would you please not talk?
I'm trying to watch.

126
00:08:59,752 --> 00:09:01,379
This show is stupid.

127
00:09:02,288 --> 00:09:05,280
You're right. Here. You pick something.

128
00:09:05,625 --> 00:09:06,887
Thanks.

129
00:09:09,095 --> 00:09:10,494
Cool uncle.

130
00:09:12,665 --> 00:09:13,825
Stupid.

131
00:09:14,834 --> 00:09:15,892
Stupid.

132
00:09:16,769 --> 00:09:17,793
Boring.

133
00:09:18,404 --> 00:09:19,666
Stupid.

134
00:09:21,307 --> 00:09:22,331
Seen it.

135
00:09:23,509 --> 00:09:24,567
Stupid.

136
00:09:25,344 --> 00:09:26,402
Stupid.

137
00:09:27,647 --> 00:09:28,909
Stupid.

138
00:09:30,016 --> 00:09:31,278
Really stupid.

139
00:09:32,452 --> 00:09:33,646
Stupid.

140
00:09:33,753 --> 00:09:34,845
Dumb.

141
00:09:34,954 --> 00:09:36,080
Stupid.

142
00:09:36,923 --> 00:09:38,117
All right!

143
00:09:41,661 --> 00:09:44,095
Pick a stupid show and live with it.

144
00:09:44,664 --> 00:09:48,031
- Forget it, I'll just go to my room.
- Jake, wait.

145
00:09:48,134 --> 00:09:50,102
Nice going, cool uncle.

146
00:09:50,169 --> 00:09:51,864
Now it's my fault?

147
00:09:51,971 --> 00:09:54,997
Let me tell you something,
between you and your whacko wife,

148
00:09:55,108 --> 00:09:57,474
I'm an oasis of normality around here.

149
00:10:02,115 --> 00:10:04,481
Are you ever gonna come back upstairs?

150
00:10:08,688 --> 00:10:10,417
I'm still an oasis.

151
00:10:22,942 --> 00:10:24,034
Morning.

152
00:10:24,109 --> 00:10:26,600
Morning. Did your guest leave?

153
00:10:26,712 --> 00:10:30,443
No, she's sleeping in.
Please do not let me forget again.

154
00:10:31,116 --> 00:10:34,142
Perhaps you should put a Post-it Note
on your penis.

155
00:10:35,888 --> 00:10:39,483
Yeah, but then I'd have to take down
the sign for the yard sale.

156
00:10:42,227 --> 00:10:44,821
Buddy, I made silver dollar pancakes.

157
00:10:44,930 --> 00:10:46,488
I'm not hungry.

158
00:10:46,599 --> 00:10:49,159
- Come on, they're your favorite.
- I said no.

159
00:10:49,468 --> 00:10:50,799
You know what I was thinking?

160
00:10:50,903 --> 00:10:54,395
Maybe later, we could have a jam session.
You on guitar, me on piano.

161
00:10:54,473 --> 00:10:56,600
I'd rather watch cartoons.

162
00:10:57,476 --> 00:11:00,912
- What is your problem?
- Charlie, calm down.

163
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:04,279
I'm sorry, but when I was his age,
I had to walk five blocks

164
00:11:04,350 --> 00:11:06,113
in the rain to have a jam session.

165
00:11:06,185 --> 00:11:08,153
Yeah, well, yelling at him isn't gonna help.

166
00:11:08,253 --> 00:11:12,246
I was thinking that maybe the three of us
could go out and do something fun today.

167
00:11:12,324 --> 00:11:13,484
You want fun?

168
00:11:13,592 --> 00:11:17,756
Let's take him to the Rose Bowl Swap
Meet and see what we can get for him.

169
00:11:18,364 --> 00:11:19,956
Or, we could be patient

170
00:11:20,032 --> 00:11:23,092
and maybe eventually he'll tell us
what's bothering him.

171
00:11:23,836 --> 00:11:26,134
Where's my grandson?

172
00:11:26,505 --> 00:11:28,871
Or, we could scare it out of him.

173
00:11:30,776 --> 00:11:34,473
Granted, I don't know what it's like
to be an 11-year-old boy,

174
00:11:34,546 --> 00:11:36,980
but I do know one thing, sweetheart.

175
00:11:37,449 --> 00:11:41,442
You have no idea
what real unhappiness is.

176
00:11:44,123 --> 00:11:47,615
Real unhappiness is
being totally ignored

177
00:11:47,693 --> 00:11:50,321
by the very people you gave birth to.

178
00:11:52,564 --> 00:11:57,194
Real unhappiness is when
you're recovering from liposuction

179
00:11:58,237 --> 00:12:02,674
and your only grandson doesn't even
send you a get-well card.

180
00:12:03,642 --> 00:12:07,976
And FYI, I only had that surgery so
you wouldn't have a grandmommy

181
00:12:08,047 --> 00:12:09,810
with matronly upper arms.

182
00:12:12,217 --> 00:12:16,051
Well, if he didn't need a shrink before,
he needs one now.

183
00:12:21,627 --> 00:12:24,391
I'm telling you, you're spoiling the kid.

184
00:12:25,064 --> 00:12:27,191
I didn't have a shrink
when I was Jake's age,

185
00:12:27,299 --> 00:12:30,132
and my childhood was
twice as screwed up as his.

186
00:12:31,837 --> 00:12:34,203
I mean, you're a little cuckoo, Judith.

187
00:12:34,973 --> 00:12:38,500
But compared to our mother,
you're like a fart in a hurricane.

188
00:12:45,050 --> 00:12:47,484
Mom never took you to see Dr. Demerest?

189
00:12:51,423 --> 00:12:54,153
- You got to see a shrink?
- Just a couple of times.

190
00:12:54,226 --> 00:12:58,356
For the night terrors, agoraphobia,
and bed-wetting.

191
00:12:59,431 --> 00:13:00,557
Did it work?

192
00:13:00,666 --> 00:13:03,726
I can pee outside in the dark.
You be the judge.

193
00:13:05,704 --> 00:13:08,673
You know, Charlie,
if you think I'm cuckoo,

194
00:13:08,741 --> 00:13:11,608
simply because I want to help my child
express his feelings,

195
00:13:11,710 --> 00:13:14,270
well, then I think you have a big problem.

196
00:13:25,090 --> 00:13:29,459
So, Jake. How you liking
that bean bag chair, huh?

197
00:13:29,561 --> 00:13:32,052
- You comfy?
- It's okay.

198
00:13:32,931 --> 00:13:35,126
'Cause we could sit in the little chairs.

199
00:13:35,234 --> 00:13:38,260
You know, sometimes I like to sit
in a little chair.

200
00:13:38,370 --> 00:13:40,565
Makes me feel like a giant.

201
00:13:43,976 --> 00:13:46,274
Hello, Jake.

202
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:50,407
Well, I can barely see you from up here.

203
00:13:55,888 --> 00:13:59,380
Do you sometimes feel like a small,
insignificant person

204
00:13:59,458 --> 00:14:01,949
in a world full of giants?

205
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:03,459
Not really.

206
00:14:04,696 --> 00:14:06,254
Well, maybe that's just me.

207
00:14:08,433 --> 00:14:11,027
So anyhow, I was hoping we could talk
for a little bit.

208
00:14:11,103 --> 00:14:14,266
Draw some pictures,
maybe play some games.

209
00:14:16,608 --> 00:14:18,405
Do you like puppets?

210
00:14:18,644 --> 00:14:20,202
Not really.

211
00:14:24,783 --> 00:14:27,445
Neither do I.

212
00:14:30,756 --> 00:14:32,917
But sometimes they help

213
00:14:32,991 --> 00:14:37,155
when I'm in a bad mood!

214
00:14:39,598 --> 00:14:41,964
I hope she gets him
to talk about the divorce.

215
00:14:42,067 --> 00:14:46,060
Yeah, it's a traumatic thing to see
his father kicked out of his house.

216
00:14:46,138 --> 00:14:50,438
It wasn't exactly healthy for him to see
the life being sucked out of his mother.

217
00:14:50,509 --> 00:14:55,003
Excuse me. But that was going on for
years, and he was still a happy little boy.

218
00:14:56,148 --> 00:14:59,140
"He stuck in his thumb
and pulled out a blank. "

219
00:15:03,021 --> 00:15:04,352
Plum, right?

220
00:15:05,490 --> 00:15:09,153
It would be nice if you took a little
responsibility for Jake's problems.

221
00:15:09,261 --> 00:15:10,751
She's right, Charlie.

222
00:15:10,829 --> 00:15:13,024
- Me? What did I do?
- You taught him how to gamble.

223
00:15:13,131 --> 00:15:14,962
You brought strange women
into the house.

224
00:15:15,033 --> 00:15:17,024
You taught him how to curse in Italian.

225
00:15:17,135 --> 00:15:18,762
Your drinking sets a bad example.

226
00:15:18,837 --> 00:15:20,998
Let's get one thing straight.

227
00:15:21,273 --> 00:15:23,935
I taught him how to curse in Spanish.

228
00:15:25,043 --> 00:15:29,104
Okay. Well, Jake and I
had a wonderful talk.

229
00:15:29,181 --> 00:15:31,979
And now I'd like to speak
with the grownups.

230
00:15:35,954 --> 00:15:37,683
Aren't you coming in, Charlie?

231
00:15:37,789 --> 00:15:41,281
No, I'm still trying to find
the toothbrush in the tree here.

232
00:15:42,294 --> 00:15:44,262
Is this Uncle Charlie?

233
00:15:44,463 --> 00:15:47,921
Well, I definitely want to talk
with Uncle Charlie.

234
00:15:50,369 --> 00:15:51,768
Thanks a lot!

235
00:15:56,141 --> 00:15:58,974
No, please, make yourselves comfortable.

236
00:16:13,725 --> 00:16:18,059
Okay, well, Jake and I
had a very nice little talk.

237
00:16:18,163 --> 00:16:21,564
I invited him to share his feelings
with me in a confidential,

238
00:16:21,667 --> 00:16:23,862
non-threatening context.

239
00:16:23,969 --> 00:16:26,460
And after hearing everything
he had to say,

240
00:16:26,538 --> 00:16:29,132
I must tell you very frankly...

241
00:16:30,909 --> 00:16:33,207
Who am I kidding, I got nothing.

242
00:16:40,519 --> 00:16:43,682
That's it? $150 an hour for "I got nothing"?

243
00:16:44,690 --> 00:16:48,353
It's $175. But that's not really
the point now, is it?

244
00:16:49,161 --> 00:16:52,187
- What did he tell you?
- He claims nothing's bothering him.

245
00:16:52,264 --> 00:16:56,325
He claims there's nothing wrong,
but when I probed just a little bit,

246
00:16:56,401 --> 00:16:58,733
he told me to besa mi culo.

247
00:17:06,745 --> 00:17:08,508
You see? Spanish.

248
00:17:09,614 --> 00:17:11,707
I hope you're proud of yourself, Charlie.

249
00:17:11,783 --> 00:17:16,083
He's not a sulky little jerk-wad
'cause he learned a second language.

250
00:17:16,188 --> 00:17:19,385
- See what my son's been living with?
- Only because she threw me out.

251
00:17:19,458 --> 00:17:21,187
What? I have a right to be happy.

252
00:17:21,259 --> 00:17:24,228
Speaking of which,
did I leave that girl at the house?

253
00:17:24,296 --> 00:17:25,763
Shut up, Charlie.

254
00:17:25,864 --> 00:17:27,331
- Don't tell me to shut up.
- Calm down.

255
00:17:27,399 --> 00:17:30,835
- I don't even know what he's doing here.
- I'm trying to keep your kid

256
00:17:30,902 --> 00:17:33,393
from turning into a neurotic basket case
like my brother.

257
00:17:33,505 --> 00:17:35,336
Maybe then, he won't marry
a messed up woman.

258
00:17:35,407 --> 00:17:37,341
I'm screwed up
because you're a lousy brother.

259
00:17:37,409 --> 00:17:40,936
- My God, your whole family's insane.
- Hold on, people!

260
00:17:43,181 --> 00:17:45,274
Even cows know

261
00:17:45,384 --> 00:17:48,046
words can hurt.

262
00:17:56,461 --> 00:17:59,953
Jake, you know that even though
your mother and I bicker sometimes,

263
00:18:00,065 --> 00:18:02,397
we will always love you, no matter what.

264
00:18:02,467 --> 00:18:03,525
I know.

265
00:18:03,602 --> 00:18:06,196
And, honey, you also need to know
that our splitting up

266
00:18:06,271 --> 00:18:08,705
- had absolutely nothing to do with you.
- I know.

267
00:18:08,774 --> 00:18:10,708
It's just that Mommy has a right
to be happy.

268
00:18:10,776 --> 00:18:12,403
Yeah, he knows.

269
00:18:13,745 --> 00:18:16,805
And whatever's bothering you,

270
00:18:16,915 --> 00:18:19,816
you know I had nothing
to do with it, right?

271
00:18:20,218 --> 00:18:21,708
- Yeah.
- See?

272
00:18:23,655 --> 00:18:25,247
Can I go to bed now?

273
00:18:25,323 --> 00:18:27,314
Now? Jake, it's only 7:00.

274
00:18:27,426 --> 00:18:28,825
I'm tired.

275
00:18:28,927 --> 00:18:32,090
All right, honey.
I'll come tuck you in before I leave.

276
00:18:33,932 --> 00:18:37,095
- Okay, that's a bad sign.
- It's a symptom of clinical depression.

277
00:18:37,169 --> 00:18:38,761
You would know.

278
00:18:40,772 --> 00:18:43,332
Please, if my kids had gone to bed
at 7:00

279
00:18:43,442 --> 00:18:47,105
I'd have dipped myself in gravy
and danced naked on the rooftops.

280
00:18:50,182 --> 00:18:52,412
She does make a hell of a gravy.

281
00:19:01,693 --> 00:19:04,287
- Morning, Uncle Charlie.
- Morning.

282
00:19:07,999 --> 00:19:09,523
Morning, Dad. Morning, Berta.

283
00:19:09,634 --> 00:19:11,124
- Morning.
- Morning.

284
00:19:11,203 --> 00:19:13,603
So, Dad, what are we gonna do today?

285
00:19:13,672 --> 00:19:16,937
I don't know. What would you like to do?

286
00:19:17,175 --> 00:19:20,770
I don't know, something fun.
Maybe we could jam, Uncle Charlie.

287
00:19:21,346 --> 00:19:22,574
Great.

288
00:19:23,448 --> 00:19:25,916
Dad, can I eat my cereal down by the TV?

289
00:19:25,984 --> 00:19:27,349
- Sure.
- Thanks.

290
00:19:31,123 --> 00:19:32,647
What happened to him?

291
00:19:33,125 --> 00:19:36,458
If I didn't know better,
I'd swear he got laid last night.

292
00:19:40,198 --> 00:19:44,100
I hope you don't mind, but I talked to
him before he went to sleep last night.

293
00:19:44,169 --> 00:19:45,693
What did you say?

294
00:19:45,804 --> 00:19:48,671
I said, drink this bottle of prune juice.

295
00:19:53,011 --> 00:19:56,003
You feed him nothing
but pizza and pancakes.

296
00:19:56,114 --> 00:19:59,208
It's a wonder his eyeballs are still
in their sockets.

297
00:20:33,251 --> 00:20:34,684
Wait a minute.

298
00:20:35,754 --> 00:20:37,551
Oh, man. Not again.

299
00:20:41,693 --> 00:20:43,888
Jake Harper. Unplugged.

300
00:21:14,392 --> 00:21:15,586
English
