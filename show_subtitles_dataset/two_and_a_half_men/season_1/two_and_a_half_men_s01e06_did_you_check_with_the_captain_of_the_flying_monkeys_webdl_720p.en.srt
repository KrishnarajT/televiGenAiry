1
00:00:09,295 --> 00:00:11,022
- Hi.
- Hi, Uncle Charlie.

2
00:00:11,023 --> 00:00:12,652
How was your game?

3
00:00:12,653 --> 00:00:15,339
The musician's softball league is a joke.

4
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:19,194
Guys trying to catch stuff that isn't there.

5
00:00:19,466 --> 00:00:22,729
People throwing up on
an easy double play ball.

6
00:00:22,730 --> 00:00:24,168
So why do you go?

7
00:00:24,169 --> 00:00:27,271
There is an open bar,
and they let me pitch.

8
00:00:27,272 --> 00:00:28,647
I've got to get dressed.

9
00:00:28,648 --> 00:00:33,125
I was going to throw this toast out,
but it's yours if you want it.

10
00:00:33,125 --> 00:00:36,040
When did I become the family dog?

11
00:00:43,873 --> 00:00:48,095
- Jake, what's this, a phone message?
- Yeah. Some lady called for you.

12
00:00:48,096 --> 00:00:50,857
Who? I can't read your writing.

13
00:00:52,734 --> 00:00:55,217
"You're a big selfish jerk."

14
00:00:58,748 --> 00:01:02,488
Okay, I know who this is. Amy.

15
00:01:04,665 --> 00:01:07,314
- Probably Amy.
- Yup, Amy.

16
00:01:07,448 --> 00:01:10,486
- She wants you to call her back.
- Yeah, that'll happen.

17
00:01:10,487 --> 00:01:14,973
- Why not?
- Because I never said I'd call her back.

18
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:16,820
Remember this, Jake,

19
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:19,634
never make promises to women
that you don't intend to keep.

20
00:01:19,635 --> 00:01:22,609
- And you know how you do that?
- Always keep my promises?

21
00:01:22,610 --> 00:01:25,007
That might work.

22
00:01:25,009 --> 00:01:28,154
A better way is never make promises.

23
00:01:28,176 --> 00:01:32,429
- What happens if Amy calls again?
- Okay, I'm glad you asked that.

24
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:34,636
When the phone rings
at Uncle Charlie's house,

25
00:01:34,637 --> 00:01:39,755
we don't just willy-nilly pick up
the receiver and answer it. No.

26
00:01:39,756 --> 00:01:43,274
What we do is we check the caller l.D.,

27
00:01:44,329 --> 00:01:47,559
and only pick up if we want
to talk to that person.

28
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:50,309
- Like Mom?
- That depends.

29
00:01:51,207 --> 00:01:53,603
Your mom, yes. My mom, no.

30
00:01:54,758 --> 00:01:57,124
How come you don't want
to talk to your mom?

31
00:01:57,125 --> 00:02:00,962
I'll tell you all about that
when you are old enough to drink.

32
00:02:00,963 --> 00:02:02,721
What if I want to talk to your mom?

33
00:02:02,722 --> 00:02:08,685
Okay, that kind of attitude is going
to break down the whole system.

34
00:02:21,179 --> 00:02:24,665
- Dad, no! Don't pick up the phone!
- Why not?

35
00:02:24,666 --> 00:02:27,628
It might be your mom. Or a woman.

36
00:02:30,039 --> 00:02:33,558
It's Amy again. She just won't give up.

37
00:02:34,294 --> 00:02:36,691
Charlie.

38
00:02:38,228 --> 00:02:41,810
Look, I appreciate your need for privacy,
but I think you're sending a bad message

39
00:02:41,811 --> 00:02:43,761
to my son about how to deal with women.

40
00:02:43,762 --> 00:02:44,913
How so?

41
00:02:44,914 --> 00:02:46,832
He thinks it's okay
to avoid somebody because

42
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:50,189
the conversation might be uncomfortable.

43
00:02:51,823 --> 00:02:53,806
Charlie!

44
00:02:53,807 --> 00:02:56,203
Okay, that's not funny.

45
00:02:56,813 --> 00:02:59,979
Look, if I am teaching
the kid anything, it's honesty.

46
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:04,362
Really? Walk me through
the lesson, Charlie. Educate me.

47
00:03:04,363 --> 00:03:08,167
Okay. I tell women upfront I'm not looking
for a long-term relationship.

48
00:03:08,168 --> 00:03:11,462
If they don't believe me, or
they're determined to change my mind,

49
00:03:11,463 --> 00:03:13,350
I have a right to avoid that conversation.

50
00:03:13,351 --> 00:03:15,525
And the phone company obviously
agrees with me,

51
00:03:15,526 --> 00:03:19,651
otherwise they wouldn't have invented
caller l.D.

52
00:03:19,652 --> 00:03:20,899
Uncle Charlie,

53
00:03:20,899 --> 00:03:24,354
what if somebody you don't want to talk
to comes over instead of calls?

54
00:03:24,355 --> 00:03:29,196
- Just tell them I'm not here.
- He's not here, Grandma!

55
00:03:30,208 --> 00:03:32,158
Mom, you just surprised me.

56
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:35,133
- You should have called first.
- Charlie, I call constantly.

57
00:03:35,134 --> 00:03:38,508
You screen like an Olympic drug tester.

58
00:03:38,909 --> 00:03:40,347
I'm happy to see you, Mom.

59
00:03:40,348 --> 00:03:43,961
I don't believe you, sweetheart.
But at least you care enough to lie.

60
00:03:43,962 --> 00:03:48,280
I care enough to lie.
You just caught me off guard.

61
00:03:48,281 --> 00:03:49,623
So, what are you doing here?

62
00:03:49,624 --> 00:03:53,557
I'm showing a house up the beach, and I
thought, while I am in the neighborhood,

63
00:03:53,558 --> 00:03:56,181
I would drop off a gift for my grandson.

64
00:03:56,182 --> 00:03:58,548
You are writing him a check?

65
00:03:58,549 --> 00:04:03,282
- What kind of gift is that?
- You told me he likes transformer toys.

66
00:04:03,283 --> 00:04:07,166
This check transforms into
any toy he wants.

67
00:04:09,424 --> 00:04:10,799
Thanks, Grandma!

68
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:13,657
Is that all? Don't I get a hug?

69
00:04:14,511 --> 00:04:17,224
Your grandma loves you so much.

70
00:04:17,646 --> 00:04:20,177
Grandma's got to go to work.

71
00:04:20,236 --> 00:04:23,748
Nobody just gives her checks. Walk me.

72
00:04:26,314 --> 00:04:30,152
In case you are at all interested, I have
been seeing a man. And

73
00:04:30,152 --> 00:04:32,358
he just may be the one.

74
00:04:32,359 --> 00:04:35,072
- Five time's the charm.
- Four.

75
00:04:35,142 --> 00:04:38,053
- But, what about the guy...
- That was annulled.

76
00:04:38,054 --> 00:04:40,899
Boy! Are we going to have a new daddy?

77
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:43,297
Bite me, Charlie.

78
00:04:44,387 --> 00:04:47,937
I would like to have a dinner
at the house so you boys can meet him.

79
00:04:47,938 --> 00:04:50,112
What night is good for you?

80
00:04:50,113 --> 00:04:54,321
- What night do you want us?
- I asked you first.

81
00:04:56,222 --> 00:05:00,891
Jake's here weekends, it's Thursday.
Check my calendar.

82
00:05:00,892 --> 00:05:03,289
Don't really want to.

83
00:05:07,097 --> 00:05:09,494
Tomorrow night, 7:00.

84
00:05:09,657 --> 00:05:13,399
It's very important to me,
and I hope you can make it.

85
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:19,363
But I will certainly understand
if you are too busy for your mother.

86
00:05:21,013 --> 00:05:22,643
You know what she is trying to do.

87
00:05:22,644 --> 00:05:24,914
- Of course I know.
- But maybe one of us should go.

88
00:05:24,915 --> 00:05:26,994
- Sure. You go, I look bad.
- What do you care?

89
00:05:26,995 --> 00:05:28,272
- I don't care.
- Then don't go.

90
00:05:28,273 --> 00:05:30,096
- I'm not going.
- I'm not going, either.

91
00:05:30,097 --> 00:05:32,847
- I'm not staying.
- We'll eat, we'll go.

92
00:05:32,848 --> 00:05:35,214
- No coffee, no dessert.
- We can't be rude.

93
00:05:35,215 --> 00:05:37,997
Watch me. I refuse to let that woman...

94
00:05:37,998 --> 00:05:41,226
- Hi, Mom.
- Better late than never.

95
00:05:41,644 --> 00:05:46,153
- We're right on time.
- I was referring to the big picture.

96
00:05:46,154 --> 00:05:47,305
Hi, Grandma.

97
00:05:47,306 --> 00:05:51,047
And look, you brought Jake
to meet my new beau.

98
00:05:51,048 --> 00:05:54,950
Come here, sweetheart. Now, tonight you
and I are going to play a game.

99
00:05:54,951 --> 00:05:57,482
And the name of the game is,

100
00:05:57,862 --> 00:06:00,258
"Don't call me Grandma."

101
00:06:00,869 --> 00:06:02,051
What kind of game is that?

102
00:06:02,052 --> 00:06:07,073
It's a fun game, honey. It only
has one rule. You have to call me Evelyn.

103
00:06:07,074 --> 00:06:09,471
- Okay.
- Try it.

104
00:06:10,209 --> 00:06:13,737
- Evelyn.
- See? We're having fun already.

105
00:06:14,368 --> 00:06:19,823
Look, you didn't bring wine. Good.
Too many people bring wine.

106
00:06:22,045 --> 00:06:26,074
Tommy, darling, I would like you
to meet my sons.

107
00:06:26,075 --> 00:06:27,161
This is Charlie.

108
00:06:27,162 --> 00:06:28,697
- Charlie.
- Hi, Tommy. How are you?

109
00:06:28,698 --> 00:06:30,425
- Alan.
- Hello.

110
00:06:30,426 --> 00:06:33,848
- And this is Jake.
- Yes, I am, Evelyn.

111
00:06:35,703 --> 00:06:37,717
Let's not beat it to death, okay?

112
00:06:37,718 --> 00:06:39,861
Good to meet you, Jake.

113
00:06:39,862 --> 00:06:44,307
There you are. Boys, this
is Tommy's daughter, Olivia.

114
00:06:44,308 --> 00:06:47,510
- Hello, Charlie.
- Hi there, stranger.

115
00:06:48,338 --> 00:06:50,128
Do you two know each other?

116
00:06:50,129 --> 00:06:52,967
- I thought I knew him.
- Oh, no.

117
00:06:54,831 --> 00:06:57,261
Okay. Who would like a drink?
I would like a drink.

118
00:06:57,262 --> 00:07:04,318
Charlie, come help me make the drinks.
Alan, talk to Olivia. Alan was a cesarean.

119
00:07:06,028 --> 00:07:11,684
It wasn't medically necessary.
She just had a function to go to.

120
00:07:13,257 --> 00:07:18,693
Is there anyone in the 310 area code
that you have not mounted?

121
00:07:18,694 --> 00:07:22,659
Come on, we went out a couple of times.
She assumed it was an exclusive thing,

122
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:27,780
and when she found out it wasn't,
she got a little upset.

123
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:33,215
Anyway, Tommy seems like a real nice
guy. I am very happy for you.

124
00:07:33,216 --> 00:07:37,884
- Goodnight.
- Charles. You are not going anywhere.

125
00:07:38,207 --> 00:07:41,628
This man is very important to me.
We are going to have a nice dinner.

126
00:07:41,629 --> 00:07:45,115
You're going to be charming,
and Tommy will remain oblivious

127
00:07:45,116 --> 00:07:48,602
to the fact that you defiled his daughter.

128
00:07:48,603 --> 00:07:52,150
She wasn't exactly filed when I met her.

129
00:07:52,409 --> 00:07:55,351
You don't know how lucky you
are to have a mother like Evelyn.

130
00:07:55,352 --> 00:07:59,989
She is the warmest, most affectionate,
giving woman I have ever known.

131
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:02,386
That's my mom.

132
00:08:02,677 --> 00:08:05,586
Call her Evelyn. That's the game.

133
00:08:05,587 --> 00:08:08,703
You play your game, I'll play mine.

134
00:08:09,234 --> 00:08:13,640
- Here we are.
- There's my little karaoke cupcake.

135
00:08:13,745 --> 00:08:16,943
Tommy, you are not telling that story.

136
00:08:16,944 --> 00:08:19,277
We took one of
those little cruises to Alaska.

137
00:08:19,278 --> 00:08:22,189
Glaciers and whales, I didn't quite
see the point of it all.

138
00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:25,163
But during the evening there
was this karaoke competition.

139
00:08:25,164 --> 00:08:27,786
And as you know,
I'm no stranger to the stage.

140
00:08:27,787 --> 00:08:29,866
Yes Mom, I know.

141
00:08:29,867 --> 00:08:31,752
Excuse me.

142
00:08:31,753 --> 00:08:34,855
Anyway, you know how l
have always sung

143
00:08:34,856 --> 00:08:38,311
These Boots Are Made for Walking,
with my little dance routine.

144
00:08:38,311 --> 00:08:41,859
Yes, Mom. I have it on my wedding video.

145
00:08:42,117 --> 00:08:45,060
- So, how've you been?
- You know...

146
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:46,467
No, I don't know, Charlie.

147
00:08:46,468 --> 00:08:50,370
When people don't return your calls, it's
kind of hard to know how they have been.

148
00:08:50,371 --> 00:08:52,449
Look, I know this
is an awkward coincidence.

149
00:08:52,450 --> 00:08:53,728
It's no coincidence.

150
00:08:53,729 --> 00:08:58,686
When my father told me who he
was dating, I made a point of being here.

151
00:08:58,687 --> 00:09:00,861
You can't argue the awkward part, right?

152
00:09:00,862 --> 00:09:05,020
So, I am zipping up my boots,
and I am about to go onstage

153
00:09:05,021 --> 00:09:11,225
when this hausfrau from Tone-Deaf, Texas,
gets up and starts singing my song.

154
00:09:11,226 --> 00:09:13,720
I think you can imagine
how unhappy I was.

155
00:09:13,721 --> 00:09:15,703
Don't tell me to calm down.
You lied to me.

156
00:09:15,704 --> 00:09:18,934
I did not lie to you. And you could
have told me this on the phone.

157
00:09:18,935 --> 00:09:21,365
- You never answer your phone.
- Of course not.

158
00:09:21,366 --> 00:09:24,463
Who wants to have this conversation?

159
00:09:24,981 --> 00:09:29,867
So, I sidled up to the woman and

160
00:09:31,122 --> 00:09:34,928
really very smoothly turned
it in to a duet,

161
00:09:34,929 --> 00:09:37,999
when suddenly she starts pushing me.

162
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,878
- You said I was very special to you.
- You were.

163
00:09:40,879 --> 00:09:46,995
- Yeah, me and three other women.
- I said you were special, not unique.

164
00:09:47,756 --> 00:09:50,153
Drop dead, you bastard.

165
00:09:51,722 --> 00:09:54,119
Excuse me!

166
00:10:02,278 --> 00:10:04,675
In my defense...

167
00:10:06,181 --> 00:10:08,577
Screw it!

168
00:10:09,476 --> 00:10:13,713
Finish the story, Evelyn.
Did you push her back?

169
00:10:19,776 --> 00:10:22,172
Stupid musician's league.

170
00:10:23,358 --> 00:10:29,019
I don't know why I bother. Get this.
Tie score, we are down to our last out.

171
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:31,418
Our best hitter, Billy Kresky's up.

172
00:10:31,419 --> 00:10:34,841
The bases are loaded, and so is Kresky.

173
00:10:35,353 --> 00:10:38,807
His whole family is standing behind
the backstop, crying and pleading,

174
00:10:38,808 --> 00:10:42,307
"Go back to rehab, Daddy, we love you! "

175
00:10:43,254 --> 00:10:45,651
Needless to say, he choked.

176
00:10:46,612 --> 00:10:49,203
Charlie, I think we have got
a bigger problem.

177
00:10:49,204 --> 00:10:53,649
- Our mother is missing.
- Don't try to cheer me up.

178
00:10:53,650 --> 00:10:57,200
I am serious. I called her home, her car,
her cell, nothing.

179
00:10:57,201 --> 00:11:00,046
Did you check with the captain
of the flying monkeys?

180
00:11:00,047 --> 00:11:01,134
Charlie!

181
00:11:01,135 --> 00:11:04,844
She's probably just sulking because l
screwed up her dinner party last week.

182
00:11:04,845 --> 00:11:09,099
That's what I thought, too. Except I called
her office and they haven't heard from her.

183
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:10,283
- Okay. That's weird.
- Yeah.

184
00:11:10,284 --> 00:11:13,449
I think somebody needs to go over there
and make sure she's okay.

185
00:11:13,450 --> 00:11:17,640
Good idea. You do that
and I'll stay here in case she calls.

186
00:11:17,641 --> 00:11:20,135
Why don't you go
and I will stay here in case she calls?

187
00:11:20,136 --> 00:11:22,246
No, I got to be honest,
I like my idea better.

188
00:11:22,247 --> 00:11:24,645
- I'm not going there alone.
- I'm not going at all.

189
00:11:24,646 --> 00:11:28,035
What do you want to bet she ran off
to Vegas to marry this Tommy guy?

190
00:11:28,036 --> 00:11:29,634
If that's all this is, great.

191
00:11:29,635 --> 00:11:32,929
The only down side would be
that you slept with our stepsister.

192
00:11:32,930 --> 00:11:35,040
Hadn't thought of that. Kinda sexy.

193
00:11:35,041 --> 00:11:37,438
- Kinda sick.
- I'm saying.

194
00:11:38,784 --> 00:11:40,510
Look, there is no one here. Let's go.

195
00:11:40,511 --> 00:11:42,908
No. I want to take a look.

196
00:11:43,390 --> 00:11:46,631
- You have a key?
- I'm the good son.

197
00:11:50,747 --> 00:11:53,144
Mom?

198
00:11:54,682 --> 00:11:57,491
Okay, she's not here. Let's go.

199
00:12:00,855 --> 00:12:03,309
Okay, she's here. Let's go.

200
00:12:04,310 --> 00:12:05,396
Charlie.

201
00:12:05,397 --> 00:12:08,660
Mom, are you all right? Why
haven't you been answering the phone?

202
00:12:08,661 --> 00:12:13,329
I didn't want to burden anyone with
my grief over the late Tommy Pearson.

203
00:12:13,330 --> 00:12:15,727
Tommy died?

204
00:12:17,617 --> 00:12:20,013
He is dead to me.

205
00:12:21,488 --> 00:12:24,782
- Okay, what happened?
- He dumped me.

206
00:12:25,966 --> 00:12:27,244
Mom, I am sorry.

207
00:12:27,245 --> 00:12:31,083
The thing between me and his daughter
happened years before you met the guy.

208
00:12:31,084 --> 00:12:33,898
This has nothing to do with you, Charlie.

209
00:12:33,899 --> 00:12:36,295
God, you're a narcissist.

210
00:12:37,737 --> 00:12:42,808
No, Tommy left me for some fresh-faced
45-year-old bimbo.

211
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:46,725
I am sorry, Mom.
I know he meant a lot to you.

212
00:12:46,725 --> 00:12:48,356
Yeah. I'm sorry, too.

213
00:12:48,357 --> 00:12:51,377
Thank you, Alan. Nice try, Charlie.

214
00:12:52,899 --> 00:12:57,792
Now if you will both please leave,
I'd like to be alone.

215
00:12:57,793 --> 00:13:00,190
We understand.

216
00:13:00,608 --> 00:13:03,966
Charlie, wait! We can't just leave her here.

217
00:13:03,967 --> 00:13:07,197
Fine. Where do you want to leave her?

218
00:13:07,198 --> 00:13:11,067
Mom, why don't you come back and stay
at Charlie's house for a few days?

219
00:13:11,068 --> 00:13:12,955
- How is that?
- Time out.

220
00:13:12,955 --> 00:13:17,688
Don't worry, Charlie. I have no desire
to impose on your life.

221
00:13:17,689 --> 00:13:21,064
Appreciate it. All right then, chin up.

222
00:13:22,519 --> 00:13:25,621
- You sure, Mom?
- Yes. Thank you, Alan.

223
00:13:25,622 --> 00:13:28,019
Okay.

224
00:13:30,004 --> 00:13:32,401
God!

225
00:13:35,187 --> 00:13:37,584
So close.

226
00:13:43,439 --> 00:13:45,262
How long is she going to sit out there?

227
00:13:45,262 --> 00:13:48,109
I don't know.
I've never seen her this depressed.

228
00:13:48,110 --> 00:13:53,130
Somebody's got to go out there
and show her a little love and support.

229
00:13:53,131 --> 00:13:56,229
- Jake!
- Yeah.

230
00:13:58,793 --> 00:14:01,448
Why don't you go out
and talk to Grandma?

231
00:14:01,449 --> 00:14:04,646
- Why?
- Because she's a little lonely.

232
00:14:04,647 --> 00:14:09,335
- She's your mom.
- Don't sass me. Go talk to Grandma.

233
00:14:15,011 --> 00:14:18,817
- Hi, Evelyn.
- Please, sweetheart, call me Grandma.

234
00:14:18,818 --> 00:14:23,716
- But what about the game?
- Games are for children, Jake.

235
00:14:28,125 --> 00:14:32,603
Uncle Charlie got me a metal detector and
sometimes I find cool stuff on the beach.

236
00:14:32,604 --> 00:14:35,898
That's nice. But you know, that cool stuff

237
00:14:35,899 --> 00:14:40,408
is stuff that other people lost
and will never get back.

238
00:14:40,409 --> 00:14:45,430
Trinkets and treasures buried
beneath the lonely sands of time.

239
00:14:45,431 --> 00:14:50,317
- Yeah, but finders, keepers, right?
- And losers, weepers.

240
00:14:55,763 --> 00:15:01,103
- He's getting killed out there.
- It's all right, he's not crying yet.

241
00:15:01,104 --> 00:15:03,886
Somebody needs to go out there
and back him up.

242
00:15:03,887 --> 00:15:06,284
$10 says it's not me.

243
00:15:11,885 --> 00:15:14,291
What's going on with you...

244
00:15:18,026 --> 00:15:21,822
The kid's got a bladder the size of a pea.

245
00:15:21,961 --> 00:15:25,077
You were a bed wetter, if I recall.

246
00:15:36,835 --> 00:15:41,088
You know what Jake would
really get a kick out of?

247
00:15:41,089 --> 00:15:45,087
If you could sing
while Charlie played the piano.

248
00:15:45,088 --> 00:15:46,846
No, Alan. I couldn't.

249
00:15:46,847 --> 00:15:52,992
- Besides, Charlie always hated that.
- Are you kidding? It was his idea.

250
00:16:10,166 --> 00:16:12,883
Pick it up, Charlie.
We are walking, not crawling.

251
00:16:12,884 --> 00:16:16,134
"Are you ready, boots? Start walking."

252
00:16:23,377 --> 00:16:25,812
- Okay, now.
- One more time.

253
00:16:52,325 --> 00:16:54,563
Mom, you okay?

254
00:16:54,564 --> 00:16:56,994
Yeah, go back to bed, Charlie.

255
00:16:56,995 --> 00:16:58,562
No, I'm up.

256
00:16:58,563 --> 00:17:01,803
It's hard to sleep after a big show.

257
00:17:03,137 --> 00:17:05,215
Thank you for that.

258
00:17:05,216 --> 00:17:07,742
Brought back some nice memories.

259
00:17:07,743 --> 00:17:09,438
You still got some chops, Mom.

260
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:12,253
You were rushing
the tempo towards the end there.

261
00:17:12,254 --> 00:17:19,003
Sorry, I always get a little carried away
when you do the James Brown medley.

262
00:17:19,546 --> 00:17:21,943
Charlie.

263
00:17:22,489 --> 00:17:25,783
Your mother's a real sad case, isn't she?

264
00:17:25,784 --> 00:17:29,331
You'll get over him. There's other guys.

265
00:17:29,783 --> 00:17:33,819
He never even called.
Never even said goodbye.

266
00:17:34,933 --> 00:17:37,419
Maybe he was scared.

267
00:17:39,667 --> 00:17:42,063
Of what?

268
00:17:42,162 --> 00:17:44,880
I knew there were no promises, no strings.

269
00:17:44,881 --> 00:17:49,243
That doesn't mean there
can't be common courtesy.

270
00:17:52,974 --> 00:17:56,453
To think I mean that little to him?

271
00:18:02,314 --> 00:18:04,711
It will be okay, Mom.

272
00:18:05,768 --> 00:18:08,165
You still got me and Alan.

273
00:18:08,295 --> 00:18:13,501
Charlie, please. I know how difficult things
are between us.

274
00:18:14,405 --> 00:18:16,801
Maybe it's my fault.

275
00:18:16,932 --> 00:18:19,328
It's not all your fault.

276
00:18:20,035 --> 00:18:23,645
I probably haven't been the best son.

277
00:18:28,128 --> 00:18:31,723
I just want you
to know that in my way,

278
00:18:31,742 --> 00:18:34,350
I want you to be happy and...

279
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:39,736
I love you.

280
00:18:44,057 --> 00:18:46,454
I guess I'll go pack.

281
00:18:46,616 --> 00:18:49,013
- Why?
- I'm going home.

282
00:18:49,655 --> 00:18:55,464
- ln the middle of the night?
- Charlie, you just said you loved me.

283
00:18:58,228 --> 00:19:01,497
You could only screw it up from here.

284
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:29,317
Donkey Kong!

285
00:19:29,896 --> 00:19:32,069
- Danke Schoen.
- Danke Schoen.

286
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:35,898
Danke Schoen. B flat. One, two, three.
