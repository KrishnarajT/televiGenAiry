1
00:00:01,751 --> 00:00:03,833
I have my own room at Mom's house, too.

2
00:00:03,834 --> 00:00:06,814
My dad doesn't. His stuff's in the garage.

3
00:00:06,815 --> 00:00:09,314
Do you know how to play Vampire Hunter?
'Cause I just got it.

4
00:00:09,315 --> 00:00:10,756
No, sorry.

5
00:00:10,757 --> 00:00:14,474
You got to chop off their heads.
Otherwise they'll keep coming at you.

6
00:00:14,475 --> 00:00:16,974
Do you know where your uncle keeps
the paper towels?

7
00:00:16,975 --> 00:00:19,664
I think there's some up there.

8
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:31,199
Hi. You must be Alan. I'm Cindy.

9
00:00:31,718 --> 00:00:33,640
Hi.

10
00:00:33,641 --> 00:00:38,367
- Hey, Jake, it's time to get dressed.
- Wait a minute.

11
00:00:38,641 --> 00:00:40,563
Can you get me a bowl
from that top shelf?

12
00:00:40,564 --> 00:00:42,965
Come on, let's go.

13
00:00:43,288 --> 00:00:46,557
What happened to "Breakfast
is the most important meal of the day"?

14
00:00:46,558 --> 00:00:48,543
Just go get dressed.

15
00:00:48,544 --> 00:00:51,524
Charlie, there is a half-naked woman
in our kitchen.

16
00:00:51,525 --> 00:00:53,926
Which half?

17
00:00:55,371 --> 00:00:57,390
- Hey, Cindy.
- Hey, Charlie.

18
00:00:57,391 --> 00:00:59,601
- How you doing?
- Not bad. How about yourself?

19
00:00:59,602 --> 00:01:02,126
Pretty good. Thanks again.

20
00:01:02,262 --> 00:01:04,248
- I'll see you soon.
- Anytime.

21
00:01:04,249 --> 00:01:06,650
Bye.

22
00:01:08,896 --> 00:01:11,427
"How you doing"? "Thanks again"?

23
00:01:11,428 --> 00:01:14,985
Charlie, casual sex is one thing,
but this is just lazy.

24
00:01:14,986 --> 00:01:17,645
What are you talking about?
I didn't have sex with her.

25
00:01:17,646 --> 00:01:20,786
She just surfs out on the Point,
uses my shower and goes to work.

26
00:01:20,787 --> 00:01:22,548
So you're not sleeping with her?

27
00:01:22,549 --> 00:01:27,003
Jeez, Alan, I don't sleep with every
buff surfer chick that uses my shower.

28
00:01:27,004 --> 00:01:28,863
What kind of guy do you think I am?

29
00:01:28,864 --> 00:01:32,580
I think you're the luckiest bastard
to walk the face of the earth, but,

30
00:01:32,581 --> 00:01:36,491
that's not my point. I don't want women
flashing their butt tattoos at my son.

31
00:01:36,492 --> 00:01:39,503
- Cindy has a tattoo?
- Yes, a butterfly.

32
00:01:39,504 --> 00:01:41,715
Right cheek or left?
No, wait, don't tell me.

33
00:01:41,716 --> 00:01:43,830
I want to be surprised.

34
00:01:43,831 --> 00:01:47,195
So you're not sleeping with her,
but you want to.

35
00:01:47,196 --> 00:01:49,247
Yeah.

36
00:01:49,248 --> 00:01:52,323
What kind of guy do you think I am?

37
00:01:52,324 --> 00:01:55,080
When I moved in here,
I said it was vital that we create

38
00:01:55,081 --> 00:01:57,868
a wholesome atmosphere for Jake.
And you said, "I understand."

39
00:01:57,869 --> 00:02:00,336
Alan, there's something
you should know about me.

40
00:02:00,337 --> 00:02:03,221
When I say I understand,
it doesn't mean I agree.

41
00:02:03,222 --> 00:02:07,516
It doesn't mean I understand.
It doesn't even mean I'm listening.

42
00:02:07,516 --> 00:02:08,861
Then why do you say it?

43
00:02:08,862 --> 00:02:12,323
It seems to make people happy,
and that's what I'm all about.

44
00:02:12,324 --> 00:02:15,881
That's very altruistic, but I would prefer
if you'd just be straight with me.

45
00:02:15,882 --> 00:02:17,963
- Fine.
- All I'm asking is that you keep in mind

46
00:02:17,964 --> 00:02:20,528
that we have an impressionable
10-year-old boy living here.

47
00:02:20,529 --> 00:02:22,930
- I understand.
- Thank you.

48
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:41,843
- That sounds nice.
- Thanks.

49
00:02:41,974 --> 00:02:44,081
So where are Jake and Alan today?

50
00:02:44,082 --> 00:02:47,307
Jake's at school and Alan's at work.

51
00:02:47,308 --> 00:02:48,585
It's just you and me.

52
00:02:48,586 --> 00:02:51,301
Tell them I said hi.
Thanks again for the shower.

53
00:02:51,302 --> 00:02:53,026
You bet. You look really nice.

54
00:02:53,027 --> 00:02:55,420
Thank you. Bye.

55
00:02:56,222 --> 00:02:58,615
Yeah, I got work to do.

56
00:03:00,055 --> 00:03:06,087
Charlie, seeing you strike out
like that just makes me love you more.

57
00:03:06,188 --> 00:03:08,711
Rose, you've got to get a hobby.

58
00:03:08,712 --> 00:03:11,105
I've got a hobby.

59
00:03:12,194 --> 00:03:14,908
- I thought we agreed we were just friends.
- We are.

60
00:03:14,909 --> 00:03:16,856
We're friends who slept together once

61
00:03:16,857 --> 00:03:19,444
and then one friend never called
the other friend,

62
00:03:19,445 --> 00:03:23,045
but luckily, the other friend forgave him.

63
00:03:23,374 --> 00:03:24,811
Where are you going?

64
00:03:24,812 --> 00:03:26,951
To make my friend
a grilled cheese sandwich.

65
00:03:26,952 --> 00:03:30,082
Rose, I don't want
a grilled cheese sandwich.

66
00:03:30,083 --> 00:03:31,903
Would you prefer a quesadilla?

67
00:03:31,904 --> 00:03:34,297
That sounds nice.

68
00:03:34,875 --> 00:03:37,278
But then you have to leave.

69
00:03:40,785 --> 00:03:43,020
Hey, Judith. Alan's at work.

70
00:03:43,021 --> 00:03:45,128
I know where Alan is.
I came to talk to you.

71
00:03:45,129 --> 00:03:48,566
- Me? But you don't like me.
- I don't.

72
00:03:51,039 --> 00:03:53,306
I like you.

73
00:03:53,307 --> 00:03:55,957
Jake's fourth grade class
was given a simple assignment.

74
00:03:55,958 --> 00:03:58,705
Draw something interesting
you see around the house.

75
00:03:58,706 --> 00:04:01,995
One child drew a record player,
another drew a parrot.

76
00:04:01,996 --> 00:04:04,389
My son drew this.

77
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:10,333
A woman's behind with a butterfly tattoo.

78
00:04:10,334 --> 00:04:12,727
On the right cheek.

79
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:16,874
I'll have to just act surprised.

80
00:04:17,075 --> 00:04:21,386
I asked him where he saw this.
He said, "In Uncle Charlie's kitchen."

81
00:04:21,387 --> 00:04:24,421
You gotta admit,
it beats the hell out of a parrot.

82
00:04:24,422 --> 00:04:26,625
Charlie, I am not in the mood.

83
00:04:26,626 --> 00:04:29,335
- Hold that thought.
- I got it.

84
00:04:29,565 --> 00:04:31,225
Hello.

85
00:04:31,226 --> 00:04:33,629
Are you in for your mother?

86
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:40,649
Charlie's in a meeting right now.
But you can talk to me.

87
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:44,450
Heck, I feel like we're practically related.

88
00:04:44,579 --> 00:04:47,230
- ls that the girl in the picture?
- Rose?

89
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:50,616
No. She doesn't have a tattoo on her butt.

90
00:04:50,617 --> 00:04:53,011
I'm guessing.

91
00:04:53,268 --> 00:04:55,695
Look, I don't care what you do
in your private time,

92
00:04:55,696 --> 00:04:58,442
but when my son is here,
I expect you to clean up your act.

93
00:04:58,443 --> 00:05:00,774
- I understand.
- I don't like coming over here

94
00:05:00,775 --> 00:05:03,841
and being the bad guy,
but I have to protect my son.

95
00:05:03,842 --> 00:05:05,917
I understand.

96
00:05:05,918 --> 00:05:09,272
It's hard enough going through
this transition all by myself.

97
00:05:09,273 --> 00:05:11,827
Alan at least has you, I have no one.

98
00:05:11,828 --> 00:05:14,575
Except my parents,
and they're completely toxic.

99
00:05:14,576 --> 00:05:16,651
I understand.

100
00:05:16,651 --> 00:05:18,567
Do you?

101
00:05:18,568 --> 00:05:20,962
I think I do.

102
00:05:20,996 --> 00:05:23,647
Thank you. That means a lot to me.

103
00:05:23,648 --> 00:05:26,874
I mean, I've always been
the good daughter or the good wife.

104
00:05:26,875 --> 00:05:27,992
And you know what?

105
00:05:27,993 --> 00:05:30,898
Outside of those relationships,
I don't know who I am.

106
00:05:30,899 --> 00:05:34,093
Am I gay, am I straight?
Who the hell knows?

107
00:05:34,094 --> 00:05:38,881
I'm scared about this, Charlie,
and I'm totally alone.

108
00:05:40,483 --> 00:05:42,876
You know what?

109
00:05:42,943 --> 00:05:45,336
I understand.

110
00:05:50,961 --> 00:05:53,354
Thank you for listening.

111
00:05:53,357 --> 00:05:55,751
Hey.

112
00:05:55,848 --> 00:05:58,595
I'm so sorry to take up your time
with all of this.

113
00:05:58,596 --> 00:06:00,989
Hey.

114
00:06:01,024 --> 00:06:03,417
I understand.

115
00:06:06,774 --> 00:06:10,020
- Thank you, Charlie.
- You're welcome.

116
00:06:12,843 --> 00:06:16,804
There's five minutes of my life
I'll never get back.

117
00:06:16,805 --> 00:06:21,333
Don't fill up. Your mom's taking us
out for lunch.

118
00:06:27,794 --> 00:06:29,933
Hey. Where have you been?

119
00:06:29,934 --> 00:06:34,137
I just had lunch with my mother
and my stalker.

120
00:06:34,885 --> 00:06:38,175
They spent the afternoon eating off
each other's plates

121
00:06:38,176 --> 00:06:41,191
and discussing my fear of intimacy.

122
00:06:41,211 --> 00:06:43,614
You do have that, you know.

123
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:47,055
Anyway, look, can we talk
about this picture Jake drew?

124
00:06:47,056 --> 00:06:53,251
What's to talk about? He's a boy.
He saw a woman's ass. He liked it.

125
00:06:53,605 --> 00:06:58,939
Thank your lucky stars
it wasn't the cable guy's ass, and move on.

126
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:01,333
Hey, Dad. Where's Cankun?

127
00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:06,318
CancÃºn?

128
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:08,713
No, it's spelled Cankun.

129
00:07:09,514 --> 00:07:11,110
It's in Mexico. Why?

130
00:07:11,111 --> 00:07:14,113
We should go there for Christmas
instead of Aunt Betty's.

131
00:07:14,114 --> 00:07:16,413
- What are you reading?
- Sports Illustrated.

132
00:07:16,414 --> 00:07:19,128
But it's mostly ladies in bathing suits.

133
00:07:19,129 --> 00:07:21,332
Jake. Come back here.

134
00:07:21,333 --> 00:07:22,483
Are you happy?

135
00:07:22,484 --> 00:07:27,223
I have my moments,
but they're becoming further apart.

136
00:07:27,371 --> 00:07:29,510
- Jake, sit down.
- Am I in trouble?

137
00:07:29,511 --> 00:07:33,599
No. It's perfectly natural for you
to be interested in women's bodies.

138
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:36,570
- Great. I'll be in my room.
- Wait.

139
00:07:36,571 --> 00:07:38,551
Let's talk a minute here.

140
00:07:38,552 --> 00:07:40,659
I don't mind you
looking at these pictures,

141
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:44,940
but it's important
that you know what they mean.

142
00:07:46,123 --> 00:07:49,081
I'd like to know that, too, Alan.

143
00:07:49,349 --> 00:07:52,319
Okay. First of all,
real women don't look like this.

144
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:54,716
These pictures have been retouched
and airbrushed

145
00:07:54,717 --> 00:07:57,878
so that the women look like
they're perfect. But they're really not.

146
00:07:57,879 --> 00:08:02,127
Excuse me, but I met that one,
and she was perfect.

147
00:08:02,128 --> 00:08:03,852
What I'm trying to explain to Jake

148
00:08:03,853 --> 00:08:06,439
is that this is not
what regular women look like.

149
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:08,803
Then why don't they use regular women?

150
00:08:08,804 --> 00:08:14,912
Because the only way regular women
can sell magazines is door-to-door.

151
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:22,092
My point is that these women
are three-dimensional human beings.

152
00:08:22,093 --> 00:08:23,498
They're not just sex objects.

153
00:08:23,499 --> 00:08:28,225
Which explains why this one's
on all fours in the surf.

154
00:08:28,226 --> 00:08:31,644
- Are you quite done?
- No. I think you're being very unfair.

155
00:08:31,645 --> 00:08:34,807
These women worked very hard,
ate very little,

156
00:08:34,807 --> 00:08:39,010
and spent a lot of money
to become sex objects.

157
00:08:39,535 --> 00:08:42,398
Those breasts alone cost $10,000.

158
00:08:43,241 --> 00:08:45,635
You can buy these?

159
00:08:46,627 --> 00:08:48,798
Thank you, Charlie.

160
00:08:48,799 --> 00:08:51,282
Some women choose

161
00:08:51,866 --> 00:08:53,941
to make their breasts larger

162
00:08:53,942 --> 00:08:57,166
with what's called surgical implants.

163
00:08:57,521 --> 00:09:00,613
- Why?
- They think bigger is better.

164
00:09:00,619 --> 00:09:03,012
I can see that.

165
00:09:03,974 --> 00:09:07,742
What really matters, Jake,
is what's inside a person.

166
00:09:07,743 --> 00:09:10,393
See, that's the lesson here.
Do you get what I'm saying?

167
00:09:10,394 --> 00:09:12,150
- I think so.
- You're sure?

168
00:09:12,151 --> 00:09:14,738
There's nothing to be embarrassed about.
I mean...

169
00:09:14,739 --> 00:09:17,132
Do you have any questions?

170
00:09:17,198 --> 00:09:19,592
- Just one.
- Fire away.

171
00:09:20,010 --> 00:09:22,490
Can I have my magazine back?

172
00:09:26,718 --> 00:09:28,442
Congratulations, Alan.

173
00:09:28,443 --> 00:09:32,416
You've managed to take the fun
out of boobs.

174
00:09:38,026 --> 00:09:40,804
Hello. Hi, Judith.

175
00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:45,079
Yeah, I'm so glad you called. I just...
What?

176
00:09:46,109 --> 00:09:48,502
She wants to talk to you.

177
00:09:48,761 --> 00:09:53,296
- Why does my wife want to talk to you?
- I don't know.

178
00:09:53,297 --> 00:09:55,690
Hey, Judith. What's up?

179
00:09:57,705 --> 00:10:00,098
I understand.

180
00:10:00,356 --> 00:10:02,335
What do you understand?

181
00:10:02,336 --> 00:10:04,730
Not a thing.

182
00:10:06,490 --> 00:10:08,883
I understand.

183
00:10:09,205 --> 00:10:11,153
What's she saying?

184
00:10:11,154 --> 00:10:13,836
Hang on, Judith. That's my other line.

185
00:10:13,837 --> 00:10:16,935
She's upset because her parents want
to take Jake to SeaWorld.

186
00:10:16,936 --> 00:10:19,234
She feels like this is crossing a boundary

187
00:10:19,235 --> 00:10:21,215
since they've been
so unsupportive recently.

188
00:10:21,216 --> 00:10:23,452
And she's not sure
if her anger is misplaced.

189
00:10:23,453 --> 00:10:25,592
Since when are you her new best friend?

190
00:10:25,592 --> 00:10:29,671
I don't know.
Something's gone horribly wrong.

191
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:33,513
Sorry, you were saying?

192
00:10:33,995 --> 00:10:36,388
I understand.

193
00:10:37,988 --> 00:10:41,691
You're the coolest. Love, Cindy.

194
00:10:42,491 --> 00:10:46,340
Are you sure
your nephew's gonna like this?

195
00:10:46,645 --> 00:10:49,172
Who says it's for my nephew?

196
00:10:49,424 --> 00:10:51,856
- You're really cute.
- Good.

197
00:10:54,311 --> 00:10:55,780
I'm sorry there's no waves.

198
00:10:55,781 --> 00:11:00,740
Yeah, I don't know how I'm gonna get
my exercise today.

199
00:11:01,211 --> 00:11:03,605
It's a puzzler.

200
00:11:06,994 --> 00:11:09,165
Why don't you open up another
bottle of wine

201
00:11:09,166 --> 00:11:12,613
- and we'll figure something out.
- Okay.

202
00:11:15,204 --> 00:11:17,886
I'm sorry to just drop by,
but I had to talk to somebody.

203
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:21,240
I just left Jake with my parents
so they could take him to San Diego,

204
00:11:21,241 --> 00:11:23,572
and I got in this terrible argument
with my father.

205
00:11:23,573 --> 00:11:26,256
He thinks it's my fault
that Alan and I are breaking up,

206
00:11:26,257 --> 00:11:28,236
and he knows exactly
how to push my buttons.

207
00:11:28,237 --> 00:11:30,408
The question is
why do I need his approval?

208
00:11:30,409 --> 00:11:33,597
Why do I need approval from any man?

209
00:11:36,223 --> 00:11:38,617
I understand.

210
00:11:38,651 --> 00:11:41,206
Charlie, how could you
possibly understand?

211
00:11:41,207 --> 00:11:43,315
I'm sorry. I didn't realize
you had company.

212
00:11:43,316 --> 00:11:45,774
No, we were just hanging out. I'm Cindy.

213
00:11:45,775 --> 00:11:47,403
- Hi. Judith.
- Hi.

214
00:11:47,404 --> 00:11:50,917
I've spent the better part of my life
trying to win my father's approval.

215
00:11:50,918 --> 00:11:53,281
- You, too?
- Yeah, I almost married a guy

216
00:11:53,282 --> 00:11:56,699
- just 'cause my father liked him.
- I married a guy just like my father.

217
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:59,869
- Disaster, right?
- It's his brother.

218
00:11:59,927 --> 00:12:02,066
I met him. He's pretty tightly wound.

219
00:12:02,067 --> 00:12:03,472
- He is.
- Yeah.

220
00:12:03,473 --> 00:12:05,580
- Do you want some wine?
- I want a lot of wine.

221
00:12:05,581 --> 00:12:07,337
Yeah.

222
00:12:07,338 --> 00:12:09,861
You know it's so funny
about relationships and men.

223
00:12:09,861 --> 00:12:13,308
- You just wonder all the time.
- Always.

224
00:12:15,484 --> 00:12:17,878
I do not understand.

225
00:12:41,615 --> 00:12:44,009
Morning, neighbor.

226
00:12:44,298 --> 00:12:47,428
- Charlie's not up yet, Rose.
- Oh, Alan,

227
00:12:47,429 --> 00:12:49,956
don't you think I know that?

228
00:12:50,304 --> 00:12:54,040
I brought a Frisbee for your son.
It's a Glow-in-the-Dark Pro model.

229
00:12:54,041 --> 00:12:58,321
- There are teeth marks in it.
- They're not mine.

230
00:13:00,878 --> 00:13:04,231
Actually, Jake's in San Diego
with his mom's parents.

231
00:13:04,232 --> 00:13:06,052
Boy, that hardly seems fair.

232
00:13:06,053 --> 00:13:09,183
Evelyn never gets any quality time
with him.

233
00:13:09,184 --> 00:13:11,577
- Evelyn?
- Your mom.

234
00:13:12,219 --> 00:13:14,454
I know her name.

235
00:13:14,455 --> 00:13:16,275
But do you know how much
she loves you,

236
00:13:16,276 --> 00:13:20,201
and would appreciate a call
once in a while?

237
00:13:20,364 --> 00:13:22,758
Hi, Alan. Shower open?

238
00:13:22,888 --> 00:13:25,703
- Yeah. Help yourself.
- Hi, Alan.

239
00:13:27,552 --> 00:13:29,564
Judith? What are you doing here?

240
00:13:29,565 --> 00:13:32,439
Cindy's teaching me to surf.
She says I'm a natural.

241
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:34,675
'Cause she's got
the upper body strength for it.

242
00:13:34,676 --> 00:13:36,464
Nothing like yours.

243
00:13:36,465 --> 00:13:40,170
You will. You just gotta build up your lats.

244
00:13:40,171 --> 00:13:42,564
Wow! They're so firm.

245
00:13:43,046 --> 00:13:47,837
Come on. I'll show you some exercises
before we hit the shower.

246
00:13:47,838 --> 00:13:50,470
So, when's Charlie getting up?

247
00:13:51,096 --> 00:13:53,489
In about nine seconds.

248
00:13:53,811 --> 00:13:56,204
Wake up!

249
00:13:57,708 --> 00:14:00,327
What? I was having a great dream.

250
00:14:00,328 --> 00:14:04,160
Your girlfriend and my wife.
Surfing. Showering. Rubber suits.

251
00:14:04,161 --> 00:14:06,555
Okay. This might be better.

252
00:14:08,506 --> 00:14:11,093
Charlie, you've got to do something.

253
00:14:11,094 --> 00:14:13,487
- You're right.
- Yeah.

254
00:14:17,067 --> 00:14:18,823
Charlie, what are you gonna do?

255
00:14:18,824 --> 00:14:21,859
What do you think? I just woke up.

256
00:14:21,891 --> 00:14:25,308
Come on. They could
be lathering each other up right now!

257
00:14:25,309 --> 00:14:28,247
Alan, you're not helping this go any faster.

258
00:14:28,248 --> 00:14:32,624
I can't believe this is going on
under my own roof. Well, under your roof.

259
00:14:32,624 --> 00:14:36,167
God knows what's going on under my roof.

260
00:14:37,192 --> 00:14:40,578
- You know, there is good news here.
- Really? What's that?

261
00:14:40,579 --> 00:14:44,539
Now we know why
I never got anywhere with Cindy.

262
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:46,934
Hello? Me?

263
00:14:47,255 --> 00:14:49,107
Okay, listen.

264
00:14:49,108 --> 00:14:51,119
What do we really know here?

265
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:52,940
Your wife has taken up surfing.

266
00:14:52,941 --> 00:14:55,335
We're good so far, right?

267
00:14:55,592 --> 00:14:58,371
She made a new friend. Still good?

268
00:14:58,372 --> 00:15:00,000
Yeah, I guess.

269
00:15:00,001 --> 00:15:04,153
Do we know for a fact
that they're showering together?

270
00:15:04,154 --> 00:15:06,230
- No.
- Okay.

271
00:15:06,231 --> 00:15:10,702
So what do we know for sure
about Cindy and Judith?

272
00:15:10,703 --> 00:15:15,921
Cindy's not interested in you,
and Judith thinks she's gay.

273
00:15:19,807 --> 00:15:22,200
There you go.

274
00:15:25,781 --> 00:15:27,952
And I got to see penguins and a manta ray.

275
00:15:27,953 --> 00:15:30,987
And I got to pet a shark.
And the coolest thing was the whales.

276
00:15:30,988 --> 00:15:32,648
They splashed everybody.

277
00:15:32,649 --> 00:15:36,354
You could see right through
this one lady's shirt.

278
00:15:36,354 --> 00:15:39,265
And I think maybe she had plants.

279
00:15:41,402 --> 00:15:43,795
Implants.

280
00:15:46,034 --> 00:15:47,407
Yeah. Implants.

281
00:15:47,408 --> 00:15:52,518
I asked Grandma if she had them,
and Grandpa said, "I wish."

282
00:15:52,519 --> 00:15:55,904
And then she got mad at him
and then they bought me ice cream.

283
00:15:55,905 --> 00:15:57,661
So you had a good trip?

284
00:15:57,662 --> 00:16:03,282
Yeah. When I got home,
I went to the movies with Mom and Cindy.

285
00:16:05,265 --> 00:16:08,129
Wait. You, Mom and Cindy?

286
00:16:08,715 --> 00:16:11,109
There you go.

287
00:16:11,686 --> 00:16:14,720
- She's gonna teach me to surf.
- Of course she is.

288
00:16:14,721 --> 00:16:19,065
She's not gonna be happy
until the whole damn family surfs.

289
00:16:19,066 --> 00:16:20,662
Why don't we give her
Aunt Betty's number?

290
00:16:20,663 --> 00:16:23,927
Squeeze that fat ass into a wet suit.

291
00:16:25,774 --> 00:16:29,127
Here, Jake. Take your pizza
and go watch TV in your room.

292
00:16:29,128 --> 00:16:30,852
Dad said "fat ass."

293
00:16:30,853 --> 00:16:35,005
You've seen Aunt Betty.
It's not swearing if it's true. Now go.

294
00:16:35,006 --> 00:16:37,241
She gets all bent out of shape
when Cindy

295
00:16:37,242 --> 00:16:40,244
is prancing around here
with her butterfly butt sticking out.

296
00:16:40,245 --> 00:16:43,758
But all of a sudden it's okay,
'cause the butt is on the other foot.

297
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:45,483
Alan, chill out, buddy.

298
00:16:45,484 --> 00:16:48,710
No! This is the worst kind of hypocrisy
and it will not stand.

299
00:16:48,711 --> 00:16:51,808
Forgive me, Alan,
but that self-righteous attitude

300
00:16:51,809 --> 00:16:54,971
is a big part of what drove Judith away
in the first place.

301
00:16:54,972 --> 00:16:58,740
What? Where did you get...
Where? Did she tell you that?

302
00:16:58,741 --> 00:17:02,446
Hey, girlfriends tell each other everything.

303
00:17:03,342 --> 00:17:05,792
Don't look at me like that.

304
00:17:06,121 --> 00:17:09,889
Listen, if she really is gay,
then there's nothing you can do about it.

305
00:17:09,890 --> 00:17:15,160
Except maybe try and figure out why
a lesbian married you in the first place.

306
00:17:15,161 --> 00:17:18,025
But if she's just experimenting

307
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:20,814
and you act all loving and supportive,

308
00:17:20,815 --> 00:17:24,664
then maybe she comes back
to the home team.

309
00:17:26,693 --> 00:17:30,781
Or maybe I could find it in my heart
to actually be loving and supportive.

310
00:17:30,782 --> 00:17:34,277
Sure, if you want to reinvent the wheel.

311
00:17:37,458 --> 00:17:40,812
Hey. You know, I would've been more
than happy to drop Jake to your house.

312
00:17:40,813 --> 00:17:42,600
No problem. This worked out great.

313
00:17:42,601 --> 00:17:45,827
I've been surfing all day with Cindy
and we just had a bite to eat.

314
00:17:45,828 --> 00:17:48,670
Isn't that nice. Listen, are you in a hurry?

315
00:17:48,671 --> 00:17:50,907
Because there's something I wanted
to talk to you about.

316
00:17:50,908 --> 00:17:53,359
No, I guess not. What's up?

317
00:17:54,421 --> 00:17:57,765
I just wanted to let you know that

318
00:17:59,629 --> 00:18:03,299
I'm okay with this. More than okay.

319
00:18:03,366 --> 00:18:08,028
I understand, love and respect you
for your courage

320
00:18:08,158 --> 00:18:10,170
to explore things.

321
00:18:10,171 --> 00:18:13,943
Thank you. I'm really starting to enjoy it.

322
00:18:15,185 --> 00:18:17,485
And I support that.

323
00:18:17,486 --> 00:18:19,753
Yeah, I've only done it
on my knees so far,

324
00:18:19,754 --> 00:18:22,851
but Cindy says I'm almost ready
to try it standing up.

325
00:18:22,852 --> 00:18:26,333
You know what?
I don't need to hear the details.

326
00:18:26,334 --> 00:18:29,815
The more important thing
is that I accept

327
00:18:29,816 --> 00:18:34,680
you and Cindy as lovers.
And more power to you, sister.

328
00:18:37,611 --> 00:18:40,149
You pompous, assuming bastard.

329
00:18:44,096 --> 00:18:46,203
You think I'm sleeping with her?

330
00:18:46,204 --> 00:18:48,598
No.

331
00:18:48,728 --> 00:18:51,283
I just got out of a 12-year marriage
and you think I would jump

332
00:18:51,284 --> 00:18:53,998
into bed with someone I just met?
Man or woman?

333
00:18:53,999 --> 00:18:56,873
- No.
- You should be ashamed of yourself.

334
00:18:56,874 --> 00:18:59,493
- I am.
- Two women become friends,

335
00:18:59,494 --> 00:19:02,528
and you jump to the conclusion
they're having sex!

336
00:19:02,529 --> 00:19:06,607
Where do you get that kind
of sleazy thinking?

337
00:19:10,834 --> 00:19:13,548
The jogger. The one on the left.

338
00:19:13,549 --> 00:19:15,338
Real?

339
00:19:15,339 --> 00:19:17,606
Good eye.

340
00:19:17,607 --> 00:19:20,194
With the sports bra,
that could have gone either way.

341
00:19:20,195 --> 00:19:25,304
Of course, if they do go either way,
they're usually fake.

342
00:19:25,305 --> 00:19:27,509
Jake, honey, get your stuff,
we're going home.

343
00:19:27,510 --> 00:19:30,767
- Okay. See you, Uncle Charlie.
- See you, buddy. Hey, girlfriend.

344
00:19:30,768 --> 00:19:35,076
Don't "girlfriend" me,
you shallow piece of crap.

345
00:19:45,719 --> 00:19:48,112
Fake.

346
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:54,054
Real.

347
00:19:54,631 --> 00:19:55,748
Jake.

348
00:19:55,749 --> 00:19:59,486
Who does she think she's kidding
with those things?

349
00:19:59,487 --> 00:20:02,137
Jake, I swear, if you don't stop it,
I'm taking you home.

350
00:20:02,138 --> 00:20:04,531
I understand.
