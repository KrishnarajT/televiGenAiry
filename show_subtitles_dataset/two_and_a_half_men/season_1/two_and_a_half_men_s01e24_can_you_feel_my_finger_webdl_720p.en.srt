1
00:00:00,855 --> 00:00:01,947
Who is it?

2
00:00:02,023 --> 00:00:03,786
I don't know. Some woman crying.

3
00:00:04,993 --> 00:00:06,551
Hold on. Charlie?

4
00:00:07,795 --> 00:00:09,387
- What?
- Phone for you.

5
00:00:11,399 --> 00:00:13,458
- Who is it?
- A hysterical woman.

6
00:00:15,403 --> 00:00:18,861
Are you insane?
I don't take calls from hysterical women.

7
00:00:18,973 --> 00:00:20,338
Here he is.

8
00:00:22,477 --> 00:00:24,308
You are very insensitive.

9
00:00:26,481 --> 00:00:29,006
Hello? Oh, hey. How are you?

10
00:00:29,651 --> 00:00:31,414
She's crying. Duh.

11
00:00:32,153 --> 00:00:35,816
Okay, calm down. I can't understand you.

12
00:00:37,592 --> 00:00:40,186
Omelet? What is "omelet"?

13
00:00:41,596 --> 00:00:43,359
Oh, I'm late.

14
00:00:45,066 --> 00:00:46,863
What are you late for, hon?

15
00:00:49,604 --> 00:00:52,437
- Get him out of here.
- Jake, go watch TV.

16
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:55,441
What's the big deal?
I don't cry when I'm late.

17
00:00:59,247 --> 00:01:01,715
Okay, are you sure? Don't yell.

18
00:01:02,483 --> 00:01:04,917
How did this... Scratch that.

19
00:01:05,787 --> 00:01:08,551
Okay. Just stay calm, I'm here for you.

20
00:01:09,057 --> 00:01:11,150
We'll deal with this together.

21
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:14,924
You didn't happen
to catch her name, did you?

22
00:01:23,557 --> 00:01:26,048
Okay, the instructions sound pretty clear.

23
00:01:26,627 --> 00:01:28,151
You pee on the stick,

24
00:01:29,663 --> 00:01:32,757
and if it turns blue
it means you're pregnant.

25
00:01:34,134 --> 00:01:35,931
The stick turns blue.

26
00:01:39,406 --> 00:01:42,307
Yes, sweetheart,
first go into the bathroom.

27
00:01:43,444 --> 00:01:45,469
Not exactly a rocket scientist.

28
00:01:45,546 --> 00:01:48,777
As opposed to the Nobel Prize winners
you usually bring home.

29
00:01:50,851 --> 00:01:53,945
I'm still here. Go ahead, let her rip.

30
00:01:57,024 --> 00:01:58,685
What do you mean you can't?

31
00:02:00,294 --> 00:02:01,522
Hold on.

32
00:02:08,135 --> 00:02:09,329
How's that?

33
00:02:11,338 --> 00:02:15,206
Yeah, I'm a genius.
Now we wait 30 seconds.

34
00:02:16,644 --> 00:02:19,135
Please, God. Please, God, please.

35
00:02:19,213 --> 00:02:21,238
Isn't it a little late for prayer, Charlie?

36
00:02:21,348 --> 00:02:23,179
Hey, don't mock my faith.

37
00:02:24,551 --> 00:02:27,076
Yeah, I'm here. Did it change colors?

38
00:02:28,355 --> 00:02:30,915
No? That's good, right?

39
00:02:32,359 --> 00:02:35,522
Sure, in a strange way
I'm a little disappointed, too.

40
00:02:37,765 --> 00:02:40,233
Hold on a sec. Yes!

41
00:02:48,409 --> 00:02:49,899
So, what else is new?

42
00:02:50,511 --> 00:02:52,945
Hey, congratulations.
When's the wedding?

43
00:02:56,350 --> 00:02:57,783
Isn't that nice?

44
00:02:58,052 --> 00:03:00,043
Best of luck. Bye-bye.

45
00:03:02,389 --> 00:03:05,517
Boy, don't you just hate
when that happens?

46
00:03:05,592 --> 00:03:09,289
Wait, so this is a common occurrence?
Don't you take precautions?

47
00:03:09,463 --> 00:03:10,930
Of course.

48
00:03:11,198 --> 00:03:15,191
But, come on, you've never found yourself
in a slow elevator without a condom?

49
00:03:17,104 --> 00:03:18,765
Look who I'm asking.

50
00:03:22,376 --> 00:03:23,934
Okay, so we need soap,

51
00:03:24,044 --> 00:03:27,036
razor blades, cotton balls.

52
00:03:27,114 --> 00:03:29,947
- Cotton balls, that reminds me.
- Reminds you of what?

53
00:03:30,617 --> 00:03:32,278
Ribbed, for her pleasure.

54
00:03:34,088 --> 00:03:35,749
Ultra thin, for mine.

55
00:03:37,057 --> 00:03:40,151
Fiesta colors for, I suppose, fiestas.

56
00:03:41,261 --> 00:03:45,960
And extra-strength, double latex,
for coyote Tuesdays.

57
00:03:48,335 --> 00:03:50,769
Boy, if women knew the trouble we go to.

58
00:03:50,838 --> 00:03:52,931
Why don't you just get snipped?

59
00:03:53,273 --> 00:03:54,968
- You mean a vasectomy?
- Yeah.

60
00:03:55,075 --> 00:03:57,475
Then say "vasectomy. "
Don't say "snipped. "

61
00:03:57,678 --> 00:04:00,112
- What's wrong with "snipped"?
- It's demeaning.

62
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:02,910
Snipped is what you get
for $12 at Supercuts.

63
00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:05,645
Fine. Why don't you get a vasectomy?

64
00:04:05,953 --> 00:04:07,284
I've considered it.

65
00:04:07,488 --> 00:04:11,447
In fact, a couple of years ago
I believe there was a petition circulating.

66
00:04:11,959 --> 00:04:13,551
So, what's holding you back?

67
00:04:13,894 --> 00:04:16,124
I don't know,
it's kind of a permanent move.

68
00:04:16,296 --> 00:04:18,890
What happens if one day
I finally meet the right woman

69
00:04:18,999 --> 00:04:20,830
and decide I want to raise a family?

70
00:04:23,003 --> 00:04:24,903
Don't cry. Look.

71
00:04:27,007 --> 00:04:30,135
You want to see Daddy dance?
You like to see Daddy dance.

72
00:04:30,344 --> 00:04:32,141
Look at Daddy dance.

73
00:04:33,647 --> 00:04:34,909
Who am I kidding?

74
00:04:38,018 --> 00:04:39,815
Sweetheart, I have to go. I've a patient.

75
00:04:40,587 --> 00:04:43,988
No, you just stay off your feet.
Remember, you're very pregnant.

76
00:04:44,525 --> 00:04:45,583
Huge.

77
00:04:45,692 --> 00:04:47,387
Yeah, I love you, too.

78
00:04:47,728 --> 00:04:50,925
I know. We're going to have a baby.

79
00:04:51,231 --> 00:04:54,928
Yes, we are. Okay, sweetie, bye-bye.

80
00:04:55,102 --> 00:04:57,570
So, Mr. Harper, you want a vasectomy?

81
00:04:58,005 --> 00:05:00,235
Yes. You do that, right?

82
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:03,332
Of course we do.
In the exam room next door. Snip, snip.

83
00:05:05,112 --> 00:05:08,172
Great. I just have a couple of
pre-snip questions.

84
00:05:08,248 --> 00:05:11,115
Shoot. Which, by the way,
you'll still do post-snip,

85
00:05:11,218 --> 00:05:13,049
if that was one of your questions.

86
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:14,948
Good.

87
00:05:15,055 --> 00:05:18,582
Of course, if I've done my job right,
you'll be shooting blanks. Yeah?

88
00:05:18,692 --> 00:05:20,182
Yeah, I got that.

89
00:05:21,295 --> 00:05:24,128
What I was wondering is
if there's any permanent effects.

90
00:05:24,231 --> 00:05:26,062
You mean like sexual impairment?

91
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:27,767
No. Wait a minute.

92
00:05:29,636 --> 00:05:31,433
There can be sexual impairment?

93
00:05:32,039 --> 00:05:34,769
No, I just wanted to see
the look on your face.

94
00:05:34,908 --> 00:05:38,139
No, actually, you'll be able to perform
exactly as you did before.

95
00:05:38,245 --> 00:05:39,439
Great.

96
00:05:39,947 --> 00:05:42,279
But what about like creativity?

97
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:46,781
See, I write music for a living.
Will I still be able to do that?

98
00:05:47,955 --> 00:05:49,752
Do you write with your testicles?

99
00:05:53,727 --> 00:05:54,853
No.

100
00:05:54,928 --> 00:05:58,386
Then it shouldn't be a problem.
Now, let me ask you a question.

101
00:05:58,465 --> 00:06:00,456
- Do you have children already?
- No.

102
00:06:00,567 --> 00:06:03,365
Then you might want to
think about freezing some sperm

103
00:06:03,437 --> 00:06:04,927
in case you ever change your mind.

104
00:06:05,072 --> 00:06:07,370
- Frozen sperm? I don't know.
- Why not?

105
00:06:07,774 --> 00:06:11,574
You know, you freeze shrimp,
it's never as good as fresh.

106
00:06:12,412 --> 00:06:14,403
That's really not the same thing.

107
00:06:14,715 --> 00:06:18,742
So you know for a fact that frozen kids
are just the same as the regulars?

108
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:21,144
Yeah, pretty much.

109
00:06:21,321 --> 00:06:24,813
Of course, when they grow up
they do tend to migrate to the Sunbelt.

110
00:06:26,493 --> 00:06:29,690
Nothing? Wow. That one kills
at urology conventions.

111
00:06:31,331 --> 00:06:33,162
Excuse me. Yes?

112
00:06:34,001 --> 00:06:35,662
Put her on. It's my wife.

113
00:06:36,170 --> 00:06:37,467
Hi, honey.

114
00:06:37,804 --> 00:06:40,671
No kidding, she's really
kicking up a storm, huh?

115
00:06:40,774 --> 00:06:42,207
Yeah, we know it's a girl.

116
00:06:42,676 --> 00:06:44,109
- Good.
- Hang on.

117
00:06:44,611 --> 00:06:46,875
Do you like Brittany or Allison for a name?

118
00:06:47,314 --> 00:06:49,612
- They're both nice.
- Yeah.

119
00:06:49,683 --> 00:06:53,346
Okay, honey, let me get this guy
out of here and I'll call you back.

120
00:06:53,854 --> 00:06:55,287
Okay, Mommy.

121
00:06:55,622 --> 00:06:57,613
Yeah, you're going to be a mommy.

122
00:06:57,858 --> 00:06:59,291
Yes, you are.

123
00:07:01,161 --> 00:07:02,822
So, frozen sperm.

124
00:07:04,298 --> 00:07:07,756
I'm just not really sure
I want to go into some little room

125
00:07:07,834 --> 00:07:09,324
with a bunch of magazines
and you know...

126
00:07:09,403 --> 00:07:11,530
Actually, we have videos now. Kind of hot.

127
00:07:12,839 --> 00:07:15,740
You don't have to do it here.
We'll give you a container,

128
00:07:15,842 --> 00:07:18,003
you can go home,
make yourself comfortable,

129
00:07:18,078 --> 00:07:20,546
dim the lights,
put on a little sweet soul music...

130
00:07:20,647 --> 00:07:22,171
I know the procedure.

131
00:07:22,249 --> 00:07:26,151
Then just bring it back here while
the little fellas are still swimming,

132
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:28,120
and we'll turn them into Popsicles.

133
00:07:28,188 --> 00:07:29,416
Popsicles?

134
00:07:29,523 --> 00:07:31,718
You know, in case
someday you want to be a pop.

135
00:07:33,427 --> 00:07:36,396
Yeah. Very clever.

136
00:07:36,496 --> 00:07:41,195
You deal with prostates and penises
all day, you better have a sense of humor.

137
00:07:41,668 --> 00:07:42,896
And warm hands.

138
00:07:43,003 --> 00:07:44,903
That's good, I'll use that.

139
00:07:45,005 --> 00:07:47,030
Warm hands. That's good. Yeah.

140
00:07:50,877 --> 00:07:52,936
I'm done. Can I go play in my room?

141
00:07:54,047 --> 00:07:57,608
Jake, Grandma came all the way
over here to spend some time with you.

142
00:07:57,684 --> 00:08:01,586
Alan, don't use guilt
as a control mechanism.

143
00:08:01,955 --> 00:08:05,049
He should only spend time with me
if he wants to.

144
00:08:11,098 --> 00:08:12,759
So I can go, right?

145
00:08:15,235 --> 00:08:16,429
Run.

146
00:08:18,972 --> 00:08:20,064
Good morning.

147
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:22,404
- Good morning, darling.
- Morning, Charlie.

148
00:08:22,643 --> 00:08:25,111
Charlie, what's wrong with your pee-pee?

149
00:08:27,948 --> 00:08:29,108
What?

150
00:08:29,216 --> 00:08:32,652
A little birdie told me you were in
a urologist's office yesterday.

151
00:08:32,753 --> 00:08:34,243
Thanks a lot, Tweety.

152
00:08:34,921 --> 00:08:36,411
I didn't say anything.

153
00:08:36,490 --> 00:08:40,620
Coincidentally, your doctor has a suite
in the same building as Dr. Shankman.

154
00:08:40,727 --> 00:08:44,322
The man responsible for one
out of three tight tushies in Beverly Hills.

155
00:08:44,431 --> 00:08:46,956
So, Dr. Shankman saw me and told you?

156
00:08:47,067 --> 00:08:49,501
No, you left your appointment card
on the table here.

157
00:08:49,603 --> 00:08:54,131
I just brought up Dr. Shankman because
no one has noticed my new tushie.

158
00:08:56,977 --> 00:08:58,308
Very nice, Mom.

159
00:08:58,412 --> 00:09:00,607
Of course. It's a Shankman.

160
00:09:03,283 --> 00:09:05,342
So, Charles, back to your pee-pee.

161
00:09:06,586 --> 00:09:08,679
I'm done. Can I go play in my room?

162
00:09:09,589 --> 00:09:12,683
There's nothing wrong with it.
I'm just getting a vasectomy.

163
00:09:14,594 --> 00:09:16,459
You must really hate me.

164
00:09:17,964 --> 00:09:19,625
Are we changing the subject?

165
00:09:20,467 --> 00:09:23,664
How can you have a vasectomy
without consulting me?

166
00:09:23,770 --> 00:09:26,603
You're selfishly robbing me
of grandchildren.

167
00:09:26,773 --> 00:09:29,765
- You've got grandchildren.
- Oh, big whoop, one.

168
00:09:32,045 --> 00:09:35,378
If it makes you feel any better,
I'm going to do the freezing thing.

169
00:09:35,482 --> 00:09:36,676
Really?

170
00:09:37,184 --> 00:09:39,448
I suppose that's better than nothing.

171
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:43,353
You know, I'm doing a freezing thing, too.

172
00:09:43,824 --> 00:09:45,348
- What?
- Excuse me?

173
00:09:45,425 --> 00:09:48,883
At death, I plan to have my head
removed and frozen until such time

174
00:09:48,995 --> 00:09:51,259
as it can be revived
and put on a monkey body.

175
00:09:55,535 --> 00:09:58,003
What? Everybody's doing it.

176
00:10:08,181 --> 00:10:10,115
Charlie, you got somebody in there?

177
00:10:10,751 --> 00:10:12,013
No.

178
00:10:12,853 --> 00:10:14,844
I need to get your towels.

179
00:10:15,889 --> 00:10:17,618
I really wish you wouldn't.

180
00:10:17,724 --> 00:10:21,751
Come on, I'm doing laundry.
I want to finish a load before I go.

181
00:10:22,963 --> 00:10:25,056
Yeah. Well, me, too.

182
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:29,701
- What?
- Never mind, just go away.

183
00:10:30,871 --> 00:10:34,068
All right. If it helps, you can think of me.

184
00:10:40,881 --> 00:10:42,280
Charlie, wait a second.

185
00:10:42,382 --> 00:10:44,612
I don't have to pick up Jake
till after dinner.

186
00:10:44,718 --> 00:10:46,117
You want to catch an early movie?

187
00:10:46,219 --> 00:10:49,620
Maybe. But I gotta make one stop first.
Come on.

188
00:10:54,494 --> 00:10:55,961
So, what's in the bag?

189
00:10:56,997 --> 00:10:59,625
- Sperm.
- No, really.

190
00:11:00,333 --> 00:11:01,391
Sperm.

191
00:11:05,439 --> 00:11:08,966
- Whose sperm?
- Seabiscuit's. Who do you think? Mine.

192
00:11:11,244 --> 00:11:13,007
I thought we were going to a movie.

193
00:11:14,114 --> 00:11:17,447
Yeah, but first I'm having my sperm frozen
and getting a vasectomy.

194
00:11:20,987 --> 00:11:23,182
I could've met you at the theater,
you know.

195
00:11:23,757 --> 00:11:25,088
Just hold the bag.

196
00:11:29,095 --> 00:11:32,258
There is another container
inside this bag, right?

197
00:11:33,099 --> 00:11:36,091
Of course.
You just gotta keep it out of the sunlight.

198
00:11:36,436 --> 00:11:39,530
Why? Is it vampire sperm?

199
00:11:43,810 --> 00:11:46,836
Jeez. He's gonna want to look in the bag.

200
00:11:46,947 --> 00:11:48,107
God.

201
00:11:48,982 --> 00:11:50,108
No!

202
00:11:51,651 --> 00:11:54,711
- What the hell did you do that for?
- I don't know, I panicked.

203
00:12:04,204 --> 00:12:06,900
- Hey, Charlie!
- What?

204
00:12:06,973 --> 00:12:09,407
Are you nuts?
You can't put that in the freezer.

205
00:12:09,709 --> 00:12:11,267
It's ice cream.

206
00:12:12,946 --> 00:12:14,937
Store-bought, not hand-cranked.

207
00:12:16,316 --> 00:12:17,749
Yeah, you're hilarious.

208
00:12:18,985 --> 00:12:20,612
You're lucky I'm still talking to you

209
00:12:20,687 --> 00:12:23,019
after tossing my swimmers
on the Coast Highway.

210
00:12:24,023 --> 00:12:25,490
- What?
- It's nothing.

211
00:12:25,592 --> 00:12:28,789
Thanks to you, I got to reschedule
the whole deal for this afternoon.

212
00:12:28,862 --> 00:12:30,796
- What whole deal?
- It's not important, Jake.

213
00:12:30,864 --> 00:12:32,331
Why shouldn't he know?

214
00:12:32,432 --> 00:12:34,764
Okay, go ahead. Explain it to him.

215
00:12:36,336 --> 00:12:37,803
Well, Jake,

216
00:12:39,672 --> 00:12:42,004
your uncle Charlie is getting a vasectomy.

217
00:12:45,445 --> 00:12:47,436
What's wrong with the car you have now?

218
00:12:52,519 --> 00:12:53,986
Well done.

219
00:12:56,656 --> 00:12:58,647
All right, let me try again.

220
00:12:59,959 --> 00:13:02,223
A vasectomy is a very simple operation.

221
00:13:02,328 --> 00:13:05,627
- Are you sick?
- No. I'm perfectly healthy.

222
00:13:06,199 --> 00:13:09,657
It's a procedure so that
I don't have babies by accident.

223
00:13:10,303 --> 00:13:12,498
Yeah, like we had to do with Scout.

224
00:13:13,706 --> 00:13:14,968
Scout?

225
00:13:15,041 --> 00:13:17,373
The dog we had. Couldn't keep it in his fur.

226
00:13:18,878 --> 00:13:20,539
Keep going, you're doing great.

227
00:13:21,815 --> 00:13:24,682
Jake, it's not exactly the same
with people as with dogs.

228
00:13:24,751 --> 00:13:25,911
I know.

229
00:13:30,690 --> 00:13:32,385
Why don't you just use a condom?

230
00:13:42,268 --> 00:13:44,759
I guess he knows more than he lets on.

231
00:13:47,774 --> 00:13:50,072
- You do, don't you?
- I hear things.

232
00:13:53,213 --> 00:13:54,840
Thanks for babysitting, Rose.

233
00:13:54,914 --> 00:13:57,439
My pleasure. Is Charlie gonna be okay?

234
00:13:57,550 --> 00:13:59,916
Yeah. He's just having
a little procedure done,

235
00:14:00,019 --> 00:14:02,044
and I need to be there to drive him home.

236
00:14:02,121 --> 00:14:04,589
- What kind of procedure?
- It's personal.

237
00:14:05,358 --> 00:14:07,451
I understand. Where is he?

238
00:14:08,061 --> 00:14:12,088
Upstairs, getting ready.
Throwing a few things in a bag.

239
00:14:13,066 --> 00:14:15,398
- I'll tell Jake you're here.
- Okay.

240
00:14:28,314 --> 00:14:30,407
- Charlie?
- Rose, for God's sake!

241
00:14:31,517 --> 00:14:35,009
- You need a hand?
- No, get out.

242
00:14:40,293 --> 00:14:42,318
- Charlie?
- What?

243
00:14:43,363 --> 00:14:46,764
- What's the little cup for?
- Go away, Rose.

244
00:14:47,467 --> 00:14:48,798
Don't be embarrassed.

245
00:14:48,868 --> 00:14:51,860
That's a perfectly natural way
to relieve stress.

246
00:14:51,971 --> 00:14:54,462
You know what I do? Jumping jacks.

247
00:14:54,941 --> 00:14:56,431
Rose, please.

248
00:14:56,876 --> 00:15:01,108
The only downside is, when I exercise,
I get all hot and sweaty,

249
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:03,876
and my clothes start clinging to my body.

250
00:15:03,983 --> 00:15:07,510
So then I have to go
and take a nice, hot, soapy shower.

251
00:15:10,390 --> 00:15:11,618
Then what?

252
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:15,288
Rose?

253
00:15:16,963 --> 00:15:18,157
Oh, damn.

254
00:15:20,667 --> 00:15:22,396
Look, I'm sorry I walked in on you.

255
00:15:22,502 --> 00:15:25,665
I thought you were finished
with the video and everything.

256
00:15:25,738 --> 00:15:28,298
- Forget it, Alan.
- I wish I could.

257
00:15:30,143 --> 00:15:32,737
Why didn't you hang a sock
on the doorknob?

258
00:15:32,845 --> 00:15:34,039
It wouldn't have helped.

259
00:15:34,147 --> 00:15:36,581
Obviously, a power
much greater than myself

260
00:15:36,683 --> 00:15:38,480
doesn't want me to freeze my sperm.

261
00:15:38,551 --> 00:15:41,145
If you don't, and you go ahead
with this vasectomy,

262
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:43,051
you'll never be able to have children.

263
00:15:43,156 --> 00:15:47,092
What difference does it make?
We both know I'm not daddy material.

264
00:15:47,193 --> 00:15:50,651
No, not now, or any time soon,

265
00:15:50,730 --> 00:15:53,699
but who knows,
maybe in the distant monkey-body future.

266
00:15:55,268 --> 00:15:58,032
Look, this is my life.
I know what's best for me.

267
00:15:59,005 --> 00:16:02,065
Okay, Mr. Harper.

268
00:16:02,175 --> 00:16:04,166
Why don't you jump up on the table,

269
00:16:04,243 --> 00:16:07,178
put your legs in the stirrups
and we'll get you shaved.

270
00:16:10,717 --> 00:16:13,185
Damn, I didn't bring the camcorder.

271
00:16:15,188 --> 00:16:17,713
- Thanks, Alan. I'll see you later.
- Yeah. Good luck.

272
00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:22,284
Don't forget to put a cone around his head
so he doesn't bite at the stitches.

273
00:16:25,965 --> 00:16:27,091
All right,

274
00:16:28,501 --> 00:16:30,230
let's have a look.

275
00:16:31,971 --> 00:16:34,405
Okay, in my defense,
it's a little cold in here.

276
00:16:35,508 --> 00:16:38,306
Boy, if I had a nickel
for every time I heard that.

277
00:16:56,629 --> 00:16:59,826
So, what's your name?

278
00:17:00,967 --> 00:17:02,161
Naomi.

279
00:17:02,535 --> 00:17:04,765
Let me ask you something, Naomi.

280
00:17:04,837 --> 00:17:08,796
Does doing this make you want
to have dinner with me more or less?

281
00:17:08,875 --> 00:17:13,278
Just a reminder, Mr. Harper,
I'm holding a razor to your genitals.

282
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:16,374
I know, but how "meet cute" is this?

283
00:17:17,650 --> 00:17:19,880
What a great story to tell our...

284
00:17:22,855 --> 00:17:24,152
Our what?

285
00:17:25,324 --> 00:17:26,552
Never mind.

286
00:17:27,794 --> 00:17:31,286
- Okay, all done.
- That was quick.

287
00:17:31,364 --> 00:17:34,527
You got a little mirror
so I can check out the back?

288
00:17:35,168 --> 00:17:36,465
Not that little.

289
00:17:38,671 --> 00:17:41,868
Come on, honey. I know. Breathe with me.

290
00:17:43,242 --> 00:17:44,573
All right, that's good.

291
00:17:44,677 --> 00:17:47,840
I gotta do one quick snip
and then I'll meet you at the hospital.

292
00:17:47,914 --> 00:17:50,041
- Excuse me, quick snip?
- No, thanks, I'm fine.

293
00:17:50,149 --> 00:17:53,414
Yeah. I love you, too.
Breathe, honey. Just breathe.

294
00:17:53,719 --> 00:17:57,314
Okay, bye-bye. It's getting exciting now.

295
00:17:58,157 --> 00:18:00,318
Okay, let's see what we're up against here.

296
00:18:00,426 --> 00:18:02,087
Woof. That's quite a haircut.

297
00:18:03,162 --> 00:18:05,221
Looks like my grandma in a bathing cap.

298
00:18:08,534 --> 00:18:10,525
Okay, Mr. Harper,

299
00:18:11,204 --> 00:18:13,172
I'm gonna give you
a local anesthetic here

300
00:18:13,239 --> 00:18:14,934
so you're gonna feel a little sting.

301
00:18:15,041 --> 00:18:18,101
Just let me know when you're about to.
Holy Mother of God!

302
00:18:19,879 --> 00:18:23,212
Okay, here it comes. Kidding.

303
00:18:24,784 --> 00:18:25,944
I got you.

304
00:18:26,052 --> 00:18:28,714
Now, we'll just give it a minute
till we're nice and numb.

305
00:18:28,788 --> 00:18:31,951
You know, we're thinking Juliet now,
or maybe Julianne.

306
00:18:32,058 --> 00:18:33,389
Both good names.

307
00:18:33,459 --> 00:18:37,452
Yeah, you want a name that fits a child,
but also is appropriate for an adult.

308
00:18:37,563 --> 00:18:38,928
Can you feel my finger?

309
00:18:39,732 --> 00:18:42,292
What finger? Why? What are you doing?

310
00:18:42,401 --> 00:18:44,562
Okay, let's start snipping.

311
00:18:47,573 --> 00:18:49,905
Naomi, could you get that for me?

312
00:18:52,612 --> 00:18:56,480
Hello? Hi, honey. No, I can talk.

313
00:18:58,317 --> 00:19:01,980
What, you're kidding, already?
Okay, don't panic, I'm on my way.

314
00:19:02,088 --> 00:19:04,648
Okay, this is a little embarrassing,
but I have to go.

315
00:19:04,757 --> 00:19:07,851
Why don't you see to it that
Mr. Harper has another appointment?

316
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:10,155
And no charge for the haircut. Yeah.

317
00:19:10,863 --> 00:19:12,455
I'm gonna be a daddy.

318
00:19:18,004 --> 00:19:19,995
Man, he looks really happy.

319
00:19:20,106 --> 00:19:22,666
Yeah, they've been trying for a long time.

320
00:19:24,043 --> 00:19:25,943
You can put your legs down now.

321
00:19:27,213 --> 00:19:29,272
Yeah, that's one option.

322
00:19:37,623 --> 00:19:40,057
- Unbelievable.
- Let it go, Alan.

323
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:43,686
Who goes in for a vasectomy
and comes out with a date?

324
00:19:44,497 --> 00:19:46,488
What? I'm a man, she's a woman.

325
00:19:46,566 --> 00:19:48,693
A woman who two minutes
after you met her

326
00:19:48,801 --> 00:19:50,200
was shaving your scrotum.

327
00:19:50,636 --> 00:19:52,228
So we skipped ahead a little.

328
00:19:55,041 --> 00:19:58,033
- You feeling any calmer, Uncle Charlie?
- What do you mean?

329
00:19:58,144 --> 00:20:00,874
When Scout had his operation,
he got real calm.

330
00:20:01,514 --> 00:20:04,381
Then he got fat and only wanted
to sleep behind the dryer.

331
00:20:06,018 --> 00:20:08,418
Okay, first of all,
it's not the same operation.

332
00:20:08,521 --> 00:20:10,489
And second of all, I didn't even have it.

333
00:20:10,556 --> 00:20:14,356
- So you're gonna have kids?
- I don't know. Maybe some day.

334
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:17,358
I hope so, because you'd be a cool dad.

335
00:20:18,931 --> 00:20:19,989
Really?

336
00:20:24,237 --> 00:20:26,102
- Did you hear that?
- Yeah.

337
00:20:26,672 --> 00:20:28,731
So, you're not gonna have the vasectomy?

338
00:20:28,841 --> 00:20:31,503
I tried my best,
but it just wasn't meant to be.

339
00:20:31,577 --> 00:20:33,010
What do you mean?

340
00:20:33,079 --> 00:20:36,708
Do you think it was a coincidence
that my urologist was having a baby

341
00:20:36,782 --> 00:20:39,717
at the very moment
I was about to get snipped?

342
00:20:39,785 --> 00:20:42,185
I mean, I'm not
a particularly religious guy,

343
00:20:42,255 --> 00:20:45,383
but clearly a power
much greater than myself

344
00:20:45,925 --> 00:20:48,223
wants me to
knock somebody up some day.

345
00:20:51,063 --> 00:20:52,189
You called?

346
00:21:21,093 --> 00:21:22,287
English
