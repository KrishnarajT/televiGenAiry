1
00:00:02,992 --> 00:00:04,619
I don't want to go to camp.

2
00:00:04,694 --> 00:00:06,719
If the kid doesn't want to go,
don't make him go.

3
00:00:06,830 --> 00:00:08,821
- Yeah.
- He's 10, he's old enough to work.

4
00:00:08,898 --> 00:00:10,331
What?

5
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:14,632
When I was your age, I spent my summers
hosing tarantulas off bananas

6
00:00:14,704 --> 00:00:17,172
in the back of my stepfather's truck.

7
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:19,674
- What's going on?
- I'm going to camp.

8
00:00:21,511 --> 00:00:24,537
Okay. Morning, all. Beautiful day.

9
00:00:25,248 --> 00:00:28,513
- You're in a good mood.
- Well, I suppose I am.

10
00:00:28,818 --> 00:00:31,616
I got a little e-mail this morning
from an ex-girlfriend,

11
00:00:31,688 --> 00:00:34,088
who says she needs to "see" me.

12
00:00:34,490 --> 00:00:37,482
No kidding. I wonder if she's "knocked up. "

13
00:00:39,762 --> 00:00:43,254
Nobody's knocked up.
I haven't heard from her in five years.

14
00:00:43,366 --> 00:00:46,164
So she's bringing you a 4-year-old.

15
00:00:46,669 --> 00:00:48,728
Believe me, nobody's bringing anything.

16
00:00:48,838 --> 00:00:51,238
- Remember Jill?
- Jill the slob?

17
00:00:51,541 --> 00:00:54,510
Yeah, but do you remember
how hot she was?

18
00:00:54,577 --> 00:00:58,775
Sure, she was a tight unit,
but she left dirty dishes everywhere.

19
00:00:59,415 --> 00:01:03,715
Swear to God, this broad left
half eaten casseroles in the bathtub.

20
00:01:03,786 --> 00:01:05,048
So?

21
00:01:05,121 --> 00:01:08,750
With a body like that she could drink
out of the toilet if she wanted to.

22
00:01:08,858 --> 00:01:11,918
Wait a minute.
Isn't she the one who dumped you?

23
00:01:12,028 --> 00:01:13,586
Somebody dumped Charlie?

24
00:01:13,696 --> 00:01:16,790
Broke his little black heart.
It was pathetic.

25
00:01:17,433 --> 00:01:19,264
She didn't dump me.

26
00:01:19,369 --> 00:01:22,861
She had personal problems and moved
to Europe to, you know, find herself.

27
00:01:22,939 --> 00:01:24,600
- Berta?
- He wept.

28
00:01:26,109 --> 00:01:28,771
I did not. I felt the appropriate
amount of sadness

29
00:01:28,878 --> 00:01:31,438
for a good relationship
that had run its course.

30
00:01:31,547 --> 00:01:34,744
I had to carry him to bed
three nights in a row.

31
00:01:34,851 --> 00:01:37,911
I was perfectly happy
sleeping under the deck.

32
00:01:38,021 --> 00:01:40,854
You bring her home, you clean up after.

33
00:01:40,924 --> 00:01:43,085
Thank God you never get any.

34
00:02:10,219 --> 00:02:12,551
- What can I get for you?
- White wine, please.

35
00:02:12,622 --> 00:02:14,317
Maybe a Chablis.

36
00:02:15,558 --> 00:02:18,618
You know, make it a beer. Light beer.

37
00:02:19,829 --> 00:02:21,296
Just a beer.

38
00:02:22,799 --> 00:02:24,266
Another one?

39
00:02:24,634 --> 00:02:27,762
Might as well.
Looks like I'm getting stood up.

40
00:02:29,472 --> 00:02:30,939
Chicks, huh?

41
00:02:31,808 --> 00:02:34,140
Maybe she's got a good reason.

42
00:02:35,144 --> 00:02:37,305
I tell you what,
if it were any other woman,

43
00:02:37,413 --> 00:02:38,971
I'd have been out of here an hour ago.

44
00:02:39,082 --> 00:02:40,982
- Really?
- Oh, yeah.

45
00:02:41,351 --> 00:02:44,343
This girl? This girl's something different.

46
00:02:47,523 --> 00:02:48,820
How so?

47
00:02:49,926 --> 00:02:53,362
Well, did you ever go out
with somebody who's not only

48
00:02:53,463 --> 00:02:56,296
great in bed
but also like a really cool friend?

49
00:02:56,366 --> 00:02:58,129
Yeah. Once.

50
00:02:59,702 --> 00:03:01,602
In fact, now that I think about it,

51
00:03:01,671 --> 00:03:04,162
the friendship was the best part
of our relationship.

52
00:03:04,273 --> 00:03:05,706
No kidding?

53
00:03:05,808 --> 00:03:08,299
Yeah. The sex was a little weird.

54
00:03:11,647 --> 00:03:14,377
We would like wrestle to get on top.

55
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:20,678
She would actually get angry
if she wasn't up there.

56
00:03:22,025 --> 00:03:24,289
Maybe she had a good reason.

57
00:03:25,928 --> 00:03:27,122
Maybe.

58
00:03:28,431 --> 00:03:30,262
Charlie, look at me.

59
00:03:35,805 --> 00:03:38,831
- How do you know my name?
- It's me.

60
00:03:39,809 --> 00:03:41,299
Me who?

61
00:03:49,719 --> 00:03:51,118
No.

62
00:03:53,656 --> 00:03:54,953
Yes.

63
00:03:57,026 --> 00:03:58,288
Jill?

64
00:03:59,028 --> 00:04:00,290
Bill.

65
00:04:04,467 --> 00:04:06,162
No.

66
00:04:14,684 --> 00:04:16,777
We're gonna need two shots of tequila.

67
00:04:16,853 --> 00:04:20,016
- That's okay, I don't want to...
- They're not for you.

68
00:04:20,356 --> 00:04:23,018
This girl you're waiting for
really must be something.

69
00:04:23,126 --> 00:04:26,357
Just serve the hooch
and mind your own business.

70
00:04:26,529 --> 00:04:29,157
- Listen, Charlie, I know...
- Hang on.

71
00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:35,101
Okay, go.

72
00:04:36,039 --> 00:04:37,973
I know this comes as a shock to you.

73
00:04:38,041 --> 00:04:40,271
Please, if I had a nickel for every time

74
00:04:40,343 --> 00:04:42,641
a girl dumped me
and disappeared for five years

75
00:04:42,712 --> 00:04:45,681
and came back as a guy, I'd have a nickel.

76
00:04:46,182 --> 00:04:47,877
Keep them coming.

77
00:04:48,318 --> 00:04:50,183
I think I owe you an explanation.

78
00:04:50,286 --> 00:04:52,277
Who pays the nickel, by the way?

79
00:04:52,355 --> 00:04:54,653
Is it you or just out of some general fund?

80
00:04:57,327 --> 00:04:58,487
Yeah?

81
00:05:01,364 --> 00:05:05,357
Remember, when we broke up and I said,
"It's not you, it's me"?

82
00:05:10,306 --> 00:05:12,467
Yes. And I believe you now.

83
00:05:14,744 --> 00:05:18,339
I was so mixed up and unhappy
as a woman:

84
00:05:18,414 --> 00:05:21,212
So? I know lots of mixed up,
unhappy women.

85
00:05:21,317 --> 00:05:24,150
They go shopping and eat ice cream.
Did you even try that?

86
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:26,381
I tried everything, but the truth is,

87
00:05:26,489 --> 00:05:29,151
I was always a man trapped
in a woman's body.

88
00:05:29,225 --> 00:05:31,386
No, I'm not buying this.

89
00:05:31,494 --> 00:05:34,725
If you were really a man back then,
you would've jumped at that

90
00:05:34,831 --> 00:05:37,994
three-way with the cocktail waitress
in Carmel.

91
00:05:38,434 --> 00:05:39,924
I begged you.

92
00:05:40,904 --> 00:05:44,340
- You haven't changed.
- I wish I could say the same.

93
00:05:45,074 --> 00:05:47,702
Charlie, how could I have explained it
to you back then?

94
00:05:47,777 --> 00:05:50,177
I couldn't even explain it to myself.

95
00:05:50,246 --> 00:05:52,942
Okay, now you've explained. Thank you.

96
00:05:54,384 --> 00:05:56,079
Nice to see you again.

97
00:05:56,186 --> 00:05:58,245
Good luck with the penis.

98
00:05:59,455 --> 00:06:00,752
Wait.

99
00:06:02,058 --> 00:06:05,619
A few minutes ago you said
I was a really cool friend.

100
00:06:06,029 --> 00:06:07,360
Yeah.

101
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:11,457
Well, I'm back in LA and I'm kind of
starting a new life.

102
00:06:13,703 --> 00:06:16,695
- And I could really use a friend.
- Oh, boy.

103
00:06:18,374 --> 00:06:19,898
It's just...

104
00:06:20,610 --> 00:06:23,101
You know, I'm completely alone,

105
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:25,948
and I'm really scared.

106
00:06:28,151 --> 00:06:29,413
Jeez.

107
00:06:31,788 --> 00:06:35,246
- It's gonna be okay, Jill.
- Bill.

108
00:06:36,025 --> 00:06:39,392
Yeah, Bill, whatever. It's okay.

109
00:06:39,696 --> 00:06:41,630
I'm still your friend.

110
00:06:42,565 --> 00:06:44,795
Charlie, you're the best.

111
00:06:47,871 --> 00:06:51,773
I wish I could've loved you the way
you deserve to be loved.

112
00:06:56,913 --> 00:07:00,212
Thanks for the ride, Bill.
You're a good friend.

113
00:07:00,283 --> 00:07:03,548
- You called me Bill.
- That's your name, lady.

114
00:07:04,554 --> 00:07:06,454
Just like old times, huh?

115
00:07:06,556 --> 00:07:09,719
Drag your drunk ass home,
take you upstairs,

116
00:07:09,792 --> 00:07:11,919
get you undressed and...

117
00:07:18,434 --> 00:07:19,765
Alan.

118
00:07:19,836 --> 00:07:22,134
You never met my brother, Alan, did you?

119
00:07:22,238 --> 00:07:24,798
No, I never met anyone
in your family, Charlie.

120
00:07:24,908 --> 00:07:27,001
Yeah, different rules now.

121
00:07:27,243 --> 00:07:31,304
Bill, this is my brother Alan.
Alan, this is my old friend, Bill.

122
00:07:31,414 --> 00:07:33,644
- Nice to meet you, Bill.
- Same here.

123
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:38,653
I thought you were gonna hook up with
that girlfriend who wanted to "see" you.

124
00:07:39,255 --> 00:07:40,483
Right.

125
00:07:40,823 --> 00:07:44,953
Turns out she changed her "mind. "

126
00:07:47,297 --> 00:07:50,323
Anyway, I ran into my old friend, Bill, here.

127
00:07:54,837 --> 00:07:58,000
So, stood up by Jill, ran into Bill.

128
00:07:58,541 --> 00:08:00,099
That's funny.

129
00:08:00,843 --> 00:08:03,539
You have a sick sense of humor, Alan.

130
00:08:03,646 --> 00:08:06,444
The house is clean, I'm going home now.

131
00:08:06,649 --> 00:08:08,879
I'll pick that up on Monday.

132
00:08:09,185 --> 00:08:11,210
I'm sorry, that's mine.

133
00:08:15,458 --> 00:08:16,516
Hi.

134
00:08:17,961 --> 00:08:19,019
Hi.

135
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:25,700
Okay, I'm out of here.

136
00:08:34,544 --> 00:08:36,910
So, Bill, you from around here?

137
00:08:37,013 --> 00:08:39,208
I was, but I moved away
for a couple years.

138
00:08:39,315 --> 00:08:41,476
I'm planning on moving back
and buying a place.

139
00:08:41,551 --> 00:08:42,745
Hello.

140
00:08:43,086 --> 00:08:46,749
Evelyn Harper, Evelyn Harper Real Estate.

141
00:08:47,690 --> 00:08:50,989
- Yeah, Mom's here.
- No problem, I'm drunk.

142
00:08:52,862 --> 00:08:55,160
I'm Bill Shraeder. I'm a friend of Charlie's.

143
00:08:55,231 --> 00:08:57,096
No need to apologize.

144
00:08:57,567 --> 00:09:00,331
So, are you interested in renting
or buying?

145
00:09:00,403 --> 00:09:02,200
- Buying.
- Excellent.

146
00:09:02,405 --> 00:09:03,895
Price range?

147
00:09:04,173 --> 00:09:06,641
- I'm flexible.
- I'll bet you are.

148
00:09:07,710 --> 00:09:10,338
- But I was talking money.
- So was I.

149
00:09:12,515 --> 00:09:15,678
Sexy and liquid. I like that in a man.

150
00:09:17,687 --> 00:09:20,520
- Nice guy. Poker buddy?
- Used to.

151
00:09:23,659 --> 00:09:25,752
And don't call me "buddy. "

152
00:09:30,666 --> 00:09:32,156
There it is.

153
00:09:34,237 --> 00:09:37,331
Thank you so much for showing me
the condos, Evelyn.

154
00:09:37,407 --> 00:09:39,204
Thank you for dinner, Bill.

155
00:09:39,275 --> 00:09:41,505
Thank you for dessert.

156
00:09:45,615 --> 00:09:48,448
Shall we go to my place
for coffee and cigars?

157
00:09:48,551 --> 00:09:51,850
- I don't smoke.
- You will when I'm done with you.

158
00:09:56,359 --> 00:09:57,883
Oh, my God.

159
00:09:58,928 --> 00:10:01,123
He's like half her age.

160
00:10:03,199 --> 00:10:05,258
Yeah. That's the problem.

161
00:10:10,367 --> 00:10:13,530
I'm trying, Charlie.
I'm trying to be open-minded.

162
00:10:13,603 --> 00:10:18,199
But our mom with a guy who's younger
than us, it's just freaking me out.

163
00:10:20,043 --> 00:10:21,237
Trust me, Alan.

164
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:26,044
Very soon you're gonna be looking back
on this moment with fond nostalgia.

165
00:10:26,249 --> 00:10:28,308
- What do you mean?
- Look.

166
00:10:29,119 --> 00:10:31,212
- Who's this?
- This is Jill.

167
00:10:31,288 --> 00:10:33,313
The woman who dumped you?

168
00:10:33,423 --> 00:10:35,550
Get over that. Nobody dumped me.

169
00:10:35,625 --> 00:10:37,957
All right, I'm sorry.
Why are we looking at Jill?

170
00:10:38,061 --> 00:10:40,052
- Just look at it.
- Okay.

171
00:10:40,630 --> 00:10:42,120
She's cute.

172
00:10:43,066 --> 00:10:44,431
Very tall.

173
00:10:45,001 --> 00:10:47,629
Broad shoulders. Holy mother of God!

174
00:10:50,974 --> 00:10:52,908
Welcome to the Matrix.

175
00:10:55,579 --> 00:10:58,912
- So Jill is...
- Yep.

176
00:11:00,584 --> 00:11:04,953
- And you and Jill used to...
- Every chance we got.

177
00:11:06,289 --> 00:11:09,781
- And Mom is...
- At this very moment.

178
00:11:11,695 --> 00:11:13,595
Holy mother of God!

179
00:11:14,764 --> 00:11:16,595
What are you guys yelling about?

180
00:11:16,666 --> 00:11:18,600
- Go to bed.
- Go to bed.

181
00:11:20,170 --> 00:11:23,139
- Do you realize what this means?
- Yes.

182
00:11:23,673 --> 00:11:26,665
I slept with a woman
who wanted to be a man.

183
00:11:27,310 --> 00:11:30,211
Or, I slept with a man in a woman's body.

184
00:11:31,348 --> 00:11:35,546
Or, and this is my new favorite,
and the title of my autobiography,

185
00:11:35,652 --> 00:11:38,416
my mom and I slept with the same dude.

186
00:11:42,826 --> 00:11:46,592
Excuse me, could we just
table that for now and discuss

187
00:11:46,663 --> 00:11:48,961
how this impacts on our mother?

188
00:11:49,032 --> 00:11:51,364
Why? The damage has been done.

189
00:11:51,868 --> 00:11:53,597
All that's left to do now is drink

190
00:11:53,670 --> 00:11:57,265
until the part of the brain
that creates mental pictures is dead.

191
00:11:57,340 --> 00:11:59,274
Charlie, stay with me.

192
00:11:59,342 --> 00:12:01,207
Do you think I'm gay?

193
00:12:02,279 --> 00:12:05,442
For God's sake, Charlie,
this is not about you.

194
00:12:05,715 --> 00:12:07,706
I like musical theater.

195
00:12:10,287 --> 00:12:13,450
Maybe all these years
I've been pathologically chasing women

196
00:12:13,523 --> 00:12:16,151
because I've been overcompensating.

197
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:19,685
You know, I've often thought that.

198
00:12:20,797 --> 00:12:23,664
What? I'm agreeing with you.
What do you want to hear?

199
00:12:23,733 --> 00:12:26,258
I want you to tell me
that there is no chance

200
00:12:26,369 --> 00:12:30,863
that either of us will ever have to call
a woman I slept with "Daddy. "

201
00:12:43,019 --> 00:12:44,577
Jill the slob.

202
00:12:52,596 --> 00:12:54,393
Gadzooks!

203
00:12:58,702 --> 00:13:00,431
- Morning.
- Morning.

204
00:13:08,712 --> 00:13:10,771
So, how was your weekend?

205
00:13:11,915 --> 00:13:13,382
- Fine.
- Okay.

206
00:13:13,583 --> 00:13:16,609
Nothing exciting happening
in your world, Charlie?

207
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:19,587
- Like what?
- I don't know.

208
00:13:20,590 --> 00:13:22,888
Go to a fun party? See a great movie?

209
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:25,723
Run into an old flame with a new wick?

210
00:13:30,433 --> 00:13:31,991
What are the odds?

211
00:13:32,102 --> 00:13:35,833
One brother turns them gay,
and the other turns them guy.

212
00:13:36,306 --> 00:13:39,742
If you don't mind, Berta,
I'd rather not talk about it.

213
00:13:39,809 --> 00:13:42,471
Okay. I'll fix you something to eat.

214
00:13:43,446 --> 00:13:46,415
How about a sausage link
and a couple eggs?

215
00:13:46,516 --> 00:13:48,450
Hello? Anybody home?

216
00:13:48,518 --> 00:13:50,247
Oh, no.

217
00:13:51,621 --> 00:13:55,853
Charlie, I need to talk to you
about your friend, Bill.

218
00:13:56,192 --> 00:13:57,955
- Oh, boy.
- Oh, boy.

219
00:13:59,863 --> 00:14:04,630
You know, I'd really rather
not discuss this in front of the help.

220
00:14:06,036 --> 00:14:09,369
- Berta, could you give us some privacy?
- Hell, no.

221
00:14:11,408 --> 00:14:13,672
- Sorry.
- Okay.

222
00:14:18,682 --> 00:14:23,051
Bill and I shared something
very special this weekend.

223
00:14:25,388 --> 00:14:28,551
I realize that might be awkward for you,

224
00:14:28,658 --> 00:14:31,491
so I thought I'd come by to discuss it.

225
00:14:32,095 --> 00:14:35,087
That's nice, Mom. Isn't that nice, Alan?

226
00:14:35,532 --> 00:14:39,559
You're the expert, Charlie.
Is it too early to start drinking?

227
00:14:40,370 --> 00:14:42,099
What's that supposed to mean?

228
00:14:42,539 --> 00:14:47,567
Mom, how much do you know about Bill?

229
00:14:47,844 --> 00:14:51,007
Charlie, I have no doubt
that you two shared

230
00:14:51,081 --> 00:14:54,539
some sordid adventures together,
but that's the past.

231
00:14:57,053 --> 00:14:59,044
The only thing that matters to me now is

232
00:14:59,122 --> 00:15:02,455
that Bill is a handsome,
sensitive, wonderful man.

233
00:15:04,928 --> 00:15:06,293
Excuse me?

234
00:15:06,396 --> 00:15:08,956
Nothing. I'm just happy to be here.

235
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:13,091
Frankly, Mom,
I'm a little uncomfortable with this.

236
00:15:13,203 --> 00:15:15,933
A little? I think I'm having a stroke.

237
00:15:18,441 --> 00:15:21,069
I knew it. You hypocrites.

238
00:15:21,578 --> 00:15:24,877
It's perfectly all right for you
to date younger women.

239
00:15:24,948 --> 00:15:28,281
But when a mature woman
gets involved with a younger man,

240
00:15:28,384 --> 00:15:30,875
somehow it's scandalous and immoral.

241
00:15:30,954 --> 00:15:34,048
- No, Mom, it's not the age.
- Well, what then?

242
00:15:35,158 --> 00:15:36,591
Because he's your friend?

243
00:15:36,659 --> 00:15:39,389
I didn't object when you dated
that friend of mine.

244
00:15:39,462 --> 00:15:41,396
- You what?
- One time.

245
00:15:41,464 --> 00:15:44,262
I was 19 and she was a very doable 42.

246
00:15:45,735 --> 00:15:49,364
And if you heard how she talked about
you, you wouldn't call her a friend.

247
00:15:49,472 --> 00:15:53,101
I've heard enough.
I'm going to continue to see Bill,

248
00:15:53,376 --> 00:15:56,504
and if you don't like it, that's just too bad.

249
00:15:56,613 --> 00:15:59,776
Wait, Mom, I thought you came here
so that we could discuss it.

250
00:15:59,849 --> 00:16:03,683
Please, I came here to brag.
I just needed an opening line.

251
00:16:05,955 --> 00:16:09,891
- Wow, she doesn't know.
- Someone's going to have to tell her.

252
00:16:09,993 --> 00:16:11,722
- Charlie?
- What?

253
00:16:11,828 --> 00:16:15,662
I'll clean your house free for a month
if you let me do it.

254
00:16:22,038 --> 00:16:24,302
Come on, it is a little funny.

255
00:16:24,374 --> 00:16:28,140
When we were dating
you never wanted me to meet your mom.

256
00:16:28,645 --> 00:16:31,910
All right, maybe not so much funny
as ironic.

257
00:16:32,982 --> 00:16:36,247
- Look, Jill. Bill.
- You're angry with me.

258
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:40,016
Not angry. Not thrilled.

259
00:16:40,657 --> 00:16:42,750
Charlie, I never planned for this to happen.

260
00:16:42,859 --> 00:16:45,191
I mean, your mom and I just hit it off.

261
00:16:45,261 --> 00:16:48,492
She beautiful, intelligent, self-assured,

262
00:16:48,565 --> 00:16:51,932
and she's just exploding
with this raw sexuality.

263
00:16:53,369 --> 00:16:56,566
No, listen, fella,

264
00:16:56,739 --> 00:17:00,072
I don't know what they told you
in orientation,

265
00:17:01,077 --> 00:17:04,911
but, Rule Number 1, when a guy talks
like that about another guy's mom,

266
00:17:05,014 --> 00:17:07,414
he's likely to get his ass kicked.

267
00:17:07,517 --> 00:17:10,077
Come on, Charlie,
please don't get all macho on me.

268
00:17:10,186 --> 00:17:12,950
You couldn't take me when I was a girl.

269
00:17:13,289 --> 00:17:14,620
Don't change the subject.

270
00:17:14,724 --> 00:17:17,955
We're talking about you and my mother.
Why haven't you told her?

271
00:17:18,061 --> 00:17:20,552
- Told her what?
- That you're lactose intolerant.

272
00:17:20,630 --> 00:17:22,120
What do you think?

273
00:17:22,232 --> 00:17:24,359
- Stop yelling at me.
- I'm not yelling at you!

274
00:17:24,434 --> 00:17:25,924
Yes, you are!

275
00:17:27,904 --> 00:17:29,565
Okay, I'm sorry.

276
00:17:30,773 --> 00:17:32,263
Look, you need to understand

277
00:17:32,342 --> 00:17:35,800
that no matter how much I hate
my mother, I love my mother,

278
00:17:35,912 --> 00:17:37,607
and I don't want to see her get hurt.

279
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:41,309
So, you got to tell her before
she finds out the hard way.

280
00:17:41,417 --> 00:17:43,749
Or whatever way she finds out.

281
00:17:45,822 --> 00:17:47,483
But what if she rejects me?

282
00:17:47,590 --> 00:17:50,184
Welcome to the rodeo, Calamity Jane.

283
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:52,321
You want to be a real man?

284
00:17:52,428 --> 00:17:55,659
Grab hold of those store-bought balls
and just tell the truth.

285
00:17:55,765 --> 00:17:57,596
Yeah, you're right.

286
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:06,035
We still friends?

287
00:18:07,143 --> 00:18:08,610
Yeah. Sure.

288
00:18:11,447 --> 00:18:14,644
I'm glad.
They're made out of Teflon, you know.

289
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:19,813
Okay, Rule Number 2...

290
00:18:22,625 --> 00:18:23,956
What'd I miss?

291
00:18:24,027 --> 00:18:26,325
Nothing. I don't think he's told her yet.

292
00:18:26,396 --> 00:18:29,229
What are you doing here?
You finished cleaning hours ago.

293
00:18:29,332 --> 00:18:33,564
I took a nap in the laundry room
so I'd be fresh for the big show.

294
00:18:36,205 --> 00:18:38,639
Okay, I think he's going for it.

295
00:18:51,521 --> 00:18:54,820
- Wow, that went surprisingly well.
- Damn.

296
00:18:58,828 --> 00:19:01,194
Wait a minute, what's he doing?

297
00:19:16,245 --> 00:19:17,769
There you go.

298
00:19:19,148 --> 00:19:20,877
See you tomorrow.

299
00:19:29,926 --> 00:19:31,985
Okay, we'll make a list.

300
00:19:32,095 --> 00:19:36,930
The pros and cons of continuing
your relationship with Bill.

301
00:19:39,402 --> 00:19:43,099
- Mom?
- Well, he certainly understands women.

302
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,437
Okay, that's a pro.

303
00:19:46,743 --> 00:19:48,643
He used to be a woman.

304
00:19:50,346 --> 00:19:51,836
I'll put con.

305
00:19:54,784 --> 00:19:57,480
He slept with Charlie
when he was a woman.

306
00:19:57,587 --> 00:20:00,283
Pro. No, wait, con. Definitely con.

307
00:20:01,024 --> 00:20:05,120
- He knows what I like in bed.
- He knows what I like in bed.

308
00:20:07,864 --> 00:20:09,923
We'll call that a wash.

309
00:20:10,767 --> 00:20:13,327
- What's the score?
- It's about even.

310
00:20:15,605 --> 00:20:17,095
He's gorgeous.

311
00:20:17,707 --> 00:20:20,198
He can afford beach-front property

312
00:20:20,309 --> 00:20:24,541
and he's got a trunk full of fabulous shoes
that fit me perfectly.

313
00:20:25,314 --> 00:20:27,874
Don't wait up, Mommy's got a date.

314
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:01,944
English
