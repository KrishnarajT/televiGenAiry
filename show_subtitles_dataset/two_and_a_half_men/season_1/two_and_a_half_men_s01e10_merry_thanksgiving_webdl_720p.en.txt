1
00:00:02,624 --> 00:00:03,886
That one looks nice.

2
00:00:03,958 --> 00:00:05,482
- You like it?
- Yeah.

3
00:00:05,593 --> 00:00:06,651
Then, no.

4
00:00:08,596 --> 00:00:09,722
Okay.

5
00:00:09,798 --> 00:00:13,757
Listen, I was wondering,
do you have any plans for Thanksgiving?

6
00:00:13,835 --> 00:00:17,601
- Alan, I don't think that far ahead.
- It's this Thursday.

7
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:20,600
No kidding.

8
00:00:20,675 --> 00:00:23,473
Didn't we just get through
that whole pumpkin,

9
00:00:23,545 --> 00:00:25,536
the costume thing with the kid?

10
00:00:25,613 --> 00:00:27,012
- Halloween?
- Yeah.

11
00:00:28,249 --> 00:00:29,614
Three weeks ago.

12
00:00:30,185 --> 00:00:33,211
- No, I got no plans. Why?
- I was thinking,

13
00:00:33,288 --> 00:00:35,518
Jake's gonna be with his mom
and her parents,

14
00:00:35,590 --> 00:00:37,558
and I thought,
maybe you and I could do something.

15
00:00:37,625 --> 00:00:39,923
Okay, want to go to Vegas?

16
00:00:39,994 --> 00:00:42,963
I was thinking something
a little more traditional.

17
00:00:43,031 --> 00:00:44,123
Reno?

18
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:48,997
- Charlie, it's a family holiday.
- Yeah, so, I'm your family.

19
00:00:49,103 --> 00:00:51,537
Unless you want to spend
a perfectly good Thursday

20
00:00:51,639 --> 00:00:54,164
with "Mom, The Impaler. "

21
00:00:54,275 --> 00:00:57,972
- Think we can get into the Bellagio?
- Leave it to me.

22
00:00:58,446 --> 00:01:00,209
That one's nice.

23
00:01:04,185 --> 00:01:05,618
Here's what we'll do.

24
00:01:05,687 --> 00:01:07,917
We'll fly to Vegas,
have a big steak dinner,

25
00:01:07,989 --> 00:01:10,184
get you a lap dance
and a bucket of nickels.

26
00:01:10,291 --> 00:01:13,556
- What are the nickels for?
- I'll explain it on the plane.

27
00:01:14,162 --> 00:01:18,360
That sounds kind of fun.
Two single guys, rocking out in Vegas,

28
00:01:18,466 --> 00:01:22,061
- the glitz, the glamour...
- Dude, don't gay it up.

29
00:01:28,009 --> 00:01:30,978
You know, I like this shirt much better.

30
00:01:31,045 --> 00:01:33,343
Stop screwing with me, Alan.

31
00:01:34,182 --> 00:01:36,343
So, who's the lucky gal?

32
00:01:36,417 --> 00:01:39,750
- Remember Lisa?
- Lisa-who-used-to-live-here, Lisa?

33
00:01:39,854 --> 00:01:43,221
She lived here, she moved out,
she lived here, I moved out.

34
00:01:44,726 --> 00:01:48,560
At one point, neither one of us lived here.
Yeah, that Lisa.

35
00:01:48,663 --> 00:01:51,723
Wow.
So, she's gonna take you back again?

36
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,264
Hey, who said she's the one
who broke up with...

37
00:01:54,369 --> 00:01:55,768
Yeah, I'm hoping.

38
00:01:56,604 --> 00:01:58,504
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

39
00:02:01,943 --> 00:02:04,673
I've completely lost confidence
in this shirt.

40
00:02:12,387 --> 00:02:15,356
- Hey, Lees! Sorry I'm late.
- Hey.

41
00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:19,048
How many times did you change
your shirt before you left the house?

42
00:02:19,694 --> 00:02:23,255
- I wanted to look pretty for you.
- You're such a girl.

43
00:02:24,232 --> 00:02:25,597
Thanks, you, too.

44
00:02:27,402 --> 00:02:30,303
- It's good to see you.
- It's good to see you, too.

45
00:02:33,808 --> 00:02:37,642
So, you want to just blow this place
and get a room?

46
00:02:39,647 --> 00:02:41,410
- I can't.
- Why not?

47
00:02:41,649 --> 00:02:43,173
I'm getting married.

48
00:02:45,286 --> 00:02:47,254
Yeah. Ha, ha. Me, too.

49
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:52,590
- I'm not kidding.
- You can't do that, you love me.

50
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:54,287
That's not the point.

51
00:02:54,362 --> 00:02:56,796
I'm tired of doing this dance of death
with you.

52
00:02:56,864 --> 00:02:59,196
Hooking up, breaking up, making up.

53
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:02,701
That's not a dance of death.
That's the circle of life.

54
00:03:04,339 --> 00:03:07,672
It may be your life, but it's not mine.
Not anymore.

55
00:03:08,209 --> 00:03:10,473
- I'm moving on.
- To what?

56
00:03:10,611 --> 00:03:14,172
To settling down, to having a family,

57
00:03:14,282 --> 00:03:18,946
to not having my heart constantly broken
by a man who refuses to grow up.

58
00:03:19,654 --> 00:03:21,178
And that would be me?

59
00:03:22,623 --> 00:03:25,319
Yes, you, you big ass.

60
00:03:27,628 --> 00:03:30,062
But the sex was awesome though, right?

61
00:03:31,299 --> 00:03:33,529
Yes, it was.
But there's more to relationships...

62
00:03:33,634 --> 00:03:37,365
- Is it awesome with your fiancÃ©?
- None of your business.

63
00:03:37,472 --> 00:03:39,702
It's not, is it?

64
00:03:39,807 --> 00:03:41,707
God, why did I call you?

65
00:03:42,043 --> 00:03:43,374
I'll tell you why.

66
00:03:43,478 --> 00:03:46,970
Because in your heart, you know
you're about to make a huge mistake

67
00:03:47,048 --> 00:03:48,879
and you want me to talk you out of it.

68
00:03:48,983 --> 00:03:52,544
No, I was hoping you and I
could have some closure.

69
00:03:52,653 --> 00:03:57,022
Then I refer you back to my suggestion
that we blow this place and get a room.

70
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:00,193
Same old Charlie.

71
00:04:02,363 --> 00:04:05,560
What if I wasn't?
Would you still be marrying this clown?

72
00:04:05,666 --> 00:04:07,156
Bo is not a clown.

73
00:04:07,368 --> 00:04:08,892
- Bo?
- Bo.

74
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:12,230
I'm sorry, Bo-Bo is a clown.

75
00:04:13,875 --> 00:04:16,503
Charlie, you'll never change.

76
00:04:16,577 --> 00:04:19,910
Look at you, a grown man
who can't even commit to long pants.

77
00:04:20,014 --> 00:04:24,007
Hey, I can commit to long pants.
I was just focused on the shirt today.

78
00:04:24,352 --> 00:04:26,912
And for your information,
I've gone through changes

79
00:04:27,021 --> 00:04:29,387
like you wouldn't believe
since the last time we were together.

80
00:04:29,457 --> 00:04:32,915
- Like what?
- Well, I have a kid now.

81
00:04:33,895 --> 00:04:37,296
God, Charlie,
what poor girl did you knock up?

82
00:04:38,399 --> 00:04:41,425
No. It's my nephew.
He and my brother are living with me now.

83
00:04:41,536 --> 00:04:45,973
- I'm like, Mr. Family Guy.
- Yeah, right, "Family Guy. "

84
00:04:46,874 --> 00:04:49,035
How's it going with your mom?

85
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:51,772
What the hell's my mom
got to do with family?

86
00:04:53,281 --> 00:04:55,249
Come on, Charlie, we both know

87
00:04:55,316 --> 00:04:59,309
you'll never have a successful relationship
with any woman, let alone me,

88
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:02,548
until you resolve your issues
with your mother.

89
00:05:02,623 --> 00:05:03,715
Well,

90
00:05:04,492 --> 00:05:07,723
as a matter of fact, it just so happens

91
00:05:07,895 --> 00:05:10,295
on that note, since you mentioned it,

92
00:05:12,066 --> 00:05:16,162
- those issues are resolved.
- Really. How'd that happen?

93
00:05:17,505 --> 00:05:21,339
You know,
communication, self-reflection,

94
00:05:21,442 --> 00:05:24,502
personal growth, crap like that.

95
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:29,479
The important thing is,
I now have a much deeper appreciation

96
00:05:29,584 --> 00:05:32,678
for what do you call them,
traditional values.

97
00:05:32,787 --> 00:05:34,687
"Traditional values?"

98
00:05:34,789 --> 00:05:37,019
This from a guy
who offered my sister a car

99
00:05:37,125 --> 00:05:38,683
if she'd come to bed with us?

100
00:05:41,762 --> 00:05:43,855
It was a joke, and I was drunk.

101
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,160
But still, it shows a yearning for family.

102
00:05:50,805 --> 00:05:54,639
- Okay, this is going nowhere.
- Lisa, wait. I'm sorry.

103
00:05:54,709 --> 00:05:57,701
I don't want you to
not be in my life anymore.

104
00:05:57,778 --> 00:05:59,712
I'd like us to be friends.

105
00:06:00,014 --> 00:06:01,811
- I'd like that, too.
- Good.

106
00:06:02,350 --> 00:06:05,183
- So when are you getting married?
- We haven't set a date.

107
00:06:05,286 --> 00:06:08,653
We're gonna talk about it when Bo
gets back from New York on Monday.

108
00:06:08,723 --> 00:06:11,715
- So, you're all alone for Thanksgiving?
- Yeah, why?

109
00:06:17,865 --> 00:06:19,230
Change of plans.

110
00:06:28,262 --> 00:06:29,923
What's so tough to understand?

111
00:06:29,997 --> 00:06:32,830
We're gonna have
a big family dinner right here.

112
00:06:33,667 --> 00:06:36,659
And whose big family
were you planning on inviting?

113
00:06:36,937 --> 00:06:40,737
You know, you, me, Jake, Mom, turkey,
just like the good old days.

114
00:06:41,408 --> 00:06:42,898
What good old days?

115
00:06:43,577 --> 00:06:46,307
It's just an expression,
don't get hung up on it.

116
00:06:46,413 --> 00:06:49,644
- Oh, and Lisa might come.
- Okay, what's going on?

117
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:53,516
- I need to show Lisa that I'm a family guy.
- But you're not.

118
00:06:55,188 --> 00:06:56,655
That's not the point.

119
00:06:57,090 --> 00:06:59,081
She's about to go off
and marry some jerk

120
00:06:59,159 --> 00:07:01,855
just because he loves her
and wants to settle down.

121
00:07:02,195 --> 00:07:04,186
I get it, you're Satan.

122
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:09,533
Alan, this is serious.
I could lose her forever.

123
00:07:09,770 --> 00:07:11,670
Wow, and you care?

124
00:07:12,773 --> 00:07:13,933
I love her, Alan.

125
00:07:14,007 --> 00:07:17,773
She's the only one I ever thought
I might eventually wind up with.

126
00:07:18,345 --> 00:07:20,176
"Eventually wind up with. "

127
00:07:22,149 --> 00:07:23,343
I'm touched.

128
00:07:24,618 --> 00:07:27,610
So you want to, what,
keep her warming up in your bullpen

129
00:07:27,688 --> 00:07:30,953
until the bottom of the ninth
when you lose your arm?

130
00:07:34,861 --> 00:07:37,489
Okay,
I don't know how we got onto sports,

131
00:07:38,699 --> 00:07:40,826
but the thing is, I really care for Lisa

132
00:07:40,901 --> 00:07:43,392
and she needs to believe
I'm capable of changing.

133
00:07:43,503 --> 00:07:45,494
But the thing is, you're not.

134
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:49,172
You don't know that. I might be.

135
00:07:49,242 --> 00:07:51,972
Who knows what would happen
if I actually tried.

136
00:07:52,145 --> 00:07:54,079
You're really serious about this.

137
00:07:54,181 --> 00:07:57,207
Alan, I've got a 200-pound turkey
melting in my lap.

138
00:07:58,418 --> 00:08:01,581
- What do you think?
- Okay, how can I help?

139
00:08:02,556 --> 00:08:06,151
Obviously, we can't have a family
Thanksgiving without a kid.

140
00:08:06,226 --> 00:08:09,024
So you need to get Jake back
from your wife.

141
00:08:09,997 --> 00:08:11,259
Simple as that?

142
00:08:11,665 --> 00:08:13,758
Okay, so I go to Judith and I say,

143
00:08:13,867 --> 00:08:16,495
"Forget the fact
that we agreed on a custody schedule,

144
00:08:16,570 --> 00:08:19,869
"forget that your parents
are driving all the way from Sacramento

145
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:24,036
"to spend time with their grandson.
Charlie needs to use our son as a prop

146
00:08:24,111 --> 00:08:27,080
"so he that can maintain
an on-again-off-again relationship

147
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:30,240
"with a woman with whom
he might eventually wind up. "

148
00:08:32,753 --> 00:08:35,119
- You know what, I'll talk to her.
- Yeah.

149
00:08:35,322 --> 00:08:38,553
No way in hell.
Are you insane? What's wrong with you?

150
00:08:38,859 --> 00:08:40,759
Okay, maybe I didn't explain it correctly.

151
00:08:40,861 --> 00:08:43,921
You explained it fine.
You're not taking Jake for Thanksgiving.

152
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:46,522
Not just Jake.
You can come, too, and your parents.

153
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:49,125
Think of it, the whole family,
just like the good old days.

154
00:08:49,202 --> 00:08:50,829
What good old days?

155
00:08:51,872 --> 00:08:54,272
Why is everybody so damn literal?

156
00:08:55,108 --> 00:08:57,941
Judith, what is Thanksgiving about,
if not family?

157
00:08:58,045 --> 00:09:01,742
Wouldn't it be good for Jake to spend
Thanksgiving with his whole family,

158
00:09:01,848 --> 00:09:06,410
because that's what
Thanksgiving is about, family and stuff.

159
00:09:08,622 --> 00:09:11,113
- I don't know.
- You wouldn't have to lift a finger.

160
00:09:11,224 --> 00:09:14,716
I'll have someone there to do the cooking,
the serving, and the cleaning.

161
00:09:14,795 --> 00:09:16,956
- Really? Who?
- My housekeeper, Berta.

162
00:09:17,064 --> 00:09:19,760
She's a saint,
and she's really looking forward to this.

163
00:09:19,933 --> 00:09:23,596
No way in hell.
Are you insane? What's wrong with you?

164
00:09:24,037 --> 00:09:27,097
- Come on.
- I don't work holidays, Charlie.

165
00:09:27,207 --> 00:09:29,539
- Please.
- I've got a life, you know.

166
00:09:29,609 --> 00:09:30,735
Pretty, please.

167
00:09:30,811 --> 00:09:33,245
My brother is in
the Witness Protection Program,

168
00:09:33,313 --> 00:09:35,281
and I've been invited to spend
Thanksgiving with him

169
00:09:35,348 --> 00:09:37,145
at an undisclosed location.

170
00:09:39,152 --> 00:09:41,086
- I'll give you $1,000.
- Done.

171
00:09:48,562 --> 00:09:51,497
- Hi, you must be Jake.
- Yes, I am.

172
00:09:51,598 --> 00:09:54,089
My wonderful Uncle Charlie
has opened his home

173
00:09:54,167 --> 00:09:57,000
to me and my father
'cause we had nowhere else to go.

174
00:10:01,274 --> 00:10:03,333
Hey, Merry Thanksgiving.

175
00:10:09,762 --> 00:10:12,094
I like what you've done with the place.

176
00:10:12,165 --> 00:10:14,224
You picked out everything here.

177
00:10:14,801 --> 00:10:18,134
I know.
Just wanted to make sure you did.

178
00:10:18,438 --> 00:10:21,430
Charlie, I've got to admit,
I never thought I'd see the day

179
00:10:21,507 --> 00:10:23,805
when you'd be hosting
a family Thanksgiving.

180
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:26,071
Like I've been telling you, I've changed.

181
00:10:26,145 --> 00:10:27,578
So, with that in mind,

182
00:10:27,647 --> 00:10:29,808
you wanna blow this place
and get a room?

183
00:10:29,916 --> 00:10:34,683
- Charlie, stop it. Come on, introduce me.
- Fine.

184
00:10:34,787 --> 00:10:37,756
Lisa, this is Judith,
my former sister-in-law,

185
00:10:37,824 --> 00:10:39,883
- but still, you know, family.
- Hi.

186
00:10:39,993 --> 00:10:41,961
- It's nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

187
00:10:42,028 --> 00:10:44,292
And these, of course,
are her wonderful parents,

188
00:10:44,364 --> 00:10:47,458
- Sherman and Lorraine.
- Sheldon and Lenore.

189
00:10:47,834 --> 00:10:50,359
Sheldon and Lenore.
It's great to see you, folks.

190
00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:54,406
- So, Shelley, how you liking California?
- We live in California.

191
00:10:55,041 --> 00:10:56,872
So you must really like it.

192
00:10:57,677 --> 00:11:01,545
- Hi, Lisa. So nice to see you again.
- Hi, Alan, long time.

193
00:11:01,648 --> 00:11:04,481
See, isn't this great?
This is why we all come together.

194
00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:06,177
We break up, we make up,

195
00:11:06,252 --> 00:11:09,915
but in the end, the love is the love
and the family is the family.

196
00:11:10,323 --> 00:11:12,257
Ease up on the wine, Charlie.

197
00:11:13,593 --> 00:11:17,029
No, he's right, and Alan,
Sheldon and I want you to know

198
00:11:17,096 --> 00:11:20,088
that even though you and our daughter
are no longer married,

199
00:11:20,199 --> 00:11:22,599
we will always think of you as our son.

200
00:11:22,869 --> 00:11:25,235
What the hell's
that supposed to mean, Ma?

201
00:11:25,371 --> 00:11:28,033
It means that, even though
you loused up your marriage,

202
00:11:28,107 --> 00:11:29,369
we still love him.

203
00:11:29,442 --> 00:11:32,070
Thanks a lot, Dad. I appreciate the blame.

204
00:11:32,178 --> 00:11:35,170
This is really Judith's family.
Let's go find mine.

205
00:11:37,216 --> 00:11:40,583
- Hey, Berta. Look who's here.
- Hi, Berta.

206
00:11:40,687 --> 00:11:43,850
Honey,
don't tell me you're back here again.

207
00:11:43,923 --> 00:11:45,515
Don't you ever learn?

208
00:11:46,392 --> 00:11:48,792
As a matter of fact, I think I have.

209
00:11:49,028 --> 00:11:51,462
Good for you. You can do so much better.

210
00:11:55,601 --> 00:11:59,560
And remember,
you may have two grandmothers,

211
00:11:59,672 --> 00:12:03,506
but only one of them has enough money
to send you to medical school.

212
00:12:03,943 --> 00:12:06,411
What if I don't want to go
to medical school?

213
00:12:06,512 --> 00:12:08,537
Then you'd break
your grandmommy's heart

214
00:12:08,614 --> 00:12:11,549
- just like your father did.
- Dad's a doctor.

215
00:12:12,418 --> 00:12:16,218
No, sweetheart.
Your father's a chiropractor.

216
00:12:16,289 --> 00:12:18,689
That's a masseuse without the hot oil.

217
00:12:19,759 --> 00:12:22,751
- Go play with your friends.
- I'm the only kid here.

218
00:12:22,862 --> 00:12:25,797
You might want to think about
why that is.

219
00:12:28,735 --> 00:12:30,202
I want more money.

220
00:12:32,238 --> 00:12:33,705
Hey, Mom.

221
00:12:33,773 --> 00:12:36,207
You remember Lisa, right?
We used to live together.

222
00:12:36,275 --> 00:12:39,438
No, I don't. I'm sorry. Hello, dear.

223
00:12:39,612 --> 00:12:42,410
My son has had so many little roommates.

224
00:12:44,484 --> 00:12:46,281
I just hope you've got better taste

225
00:12:46,385 --> 00:12:49,286
than the one who picked out
his hideous furniture.

226
00:12:52,725 --> 00:12:55,660
Hey, who's got unresolved issues
with her now?

227
00:12:56,829 --> 00:12:59,923
Did it ever occur to you
that you might want to support me,

228
00:12:59,999 --> 00:13:03,901
- your daughter?
- Why can't we support Alan, too?

229
00:13:04,237 --> 00:13:08,503
- Because I'm divorcing him.
- Who told you to go and do that?

230
00:13:10,309 --> 00:13:11,469
It's very sweet of you

231
00:13:11,577 --> 00:13:13,977
to go to all this trouble,
but who are you kidding?

232
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:17,743
The plaid shirt,
the sweater vest, the kid actor.

233
00:13:17,817 --> 00:13:19,944
No, that's really my nephew.

234
00:13:20,686 --> 00:13:23,951
I love you, Charlie,
but you're not gonna change my mind.

235
00:13:25,158 --> 00:13:26,955
- Live with me.
- Charlie.

236
00:13:27,026 --> 00:13:30,689
- No, I'm serious. Move back in.
- Really? And then what?

237
00:13:30,930 --> 00:13:32,761
And then, we'll see.

238
00:13:33,299 --> 00:13:36,496
Wow, a commitment to "see. "

239
00:13:36,869 --> 00:13:39,997
And what finger does that ring go on,
Charlie?

240
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:43,702
- You know what I mean.
- I know exactly what you mean.

241
00:13:43,810 --> 00:13:46,506
You want me to waste
a couple of more years of my life

242
00:13:46,612 --> 00:13:49,342
on a relationship
that's absolutely doomed to fail.

243
00:13:49,448 --> 00:13:51,939
Not your life, our life.

244
00:13:54,453 --> 00:13:57,854
Look, I appreciate your feelings for me,
but I have to tell you,

245
00:13:57,957 --> 00:14:00,551
I really think your daughter deserves
a lot of respect.

246
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:03,959
It takes real courage to make changes
in your life and not worry

247
00:14:04,030 --> 00:14:06,430
- about what everybody thinks.
- Thank you, Alan.

248
00:14:06,499 --> 00:14:07,557
That's true.

249
00:14:07,633 --> 00:14:11,831
The lesbians of my generation
were too scared to come out of the closet.

250
00:14:18,377 --> 00:14:20,242
Does that mean what I think it means?

251
00:14:20,346 --> 00:14:22,576
- You haven't told them?
- No.

252
00:14:22,682 --> 00:14:25,981
I thought it would be more appropriate
coming from your mother.

253
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:30,682
I'm sorry, did I faux pas?

254
00:14:31,357 --> 00:14:34,190
- Yes, just get her out of here.
- Mom...

255
00:14:36,596 --> 00:14:38,154
What was I thinking?

256
00:14:42,902 --> 00:14:44,392
Happy Thanksgiving.

257
00:14:45,571 --> 00:14:48,938
Sorry I'm late,
but I didn't realize you're having a party.

258
00:14:49,942 --> 00:14:51,534
- Hi, I'm Rose.
- Hi.

259
00:14:51,611 --> 00:14:55,047
Don't worry. Charlie and I had sex once,
but now we're just friends.

260
00:14:56,382 --> 00:14:58,282
Who's ready for mystery pie?

261
00:15:00,253 --> 00:15:02,517
If you were living here,
these kinds of things

262
00:15:02,588 --> 00:15:04,419
probably wouldn't happen.

263
00:15:13,566 --> 00:15:14,692
Here it is.

264
00:15:20,506 --> 00:15:22,201
Berta, nice looking bird,

265
00:15:22,275 --> 00:15:25,506
thanks for blowing off your family
and cooking for ours.

266
00:15:26,178 --> 00:15:27,372
Shove over.

267
00:15:29,615 --> 00:15:33,278
Are we gonna go around the table
and say what we're thankful for?

268
00:15:35,721 --> 00:15:37,621
Me, I got one.

269
00:15:38,591 --> 00:15:42,618
I'm thankful for the food we eat,
and thankful for the friends we meet.

270
00:15:42,929 --> 00:15:45,523
I'm thankful for my comfy seat.

271
00:15:45,798 --> 00:15:49,700
I'm thankful for the birdie's feet.

272
00:15:51,604 --> 00:15:55,938
White with foam, God bless America

273
00:15:56,042 --> 00:15:57,873
- Pull up, Rose.
- Sorry.

274
00:15:59,745 --> 00:16:01,736
- Jake, why don't you go?
- Okay.

275
00:16:02,081 --> 00:16:05,278
I'm thankful for my mom and dad,
and my Uncle Charlie,

276
00:16:05,451 --> 00:16:09,148
"who has shown in the few short months
that I've been here

277
00:16:09,255 --> 00:16:11,450
"that he is capable of... "

278
00:16:11,891 --> 00:16:13,119
Significant.

279
00:16:13,225 --> 00:16:15,420
"... significant change and growth. "

280
00:16:19,465 --> 00:16:21,296
- Too obvious?
- Little bit.

281
00:16:22,568 --> 00:16:26,937
Okay, well, I'm thankful
that I can spend the holiday with

282
00:16:27,239 --> 00:16:31,175
all the people I love,
and all the people who love me,

283
00:16:32,311 --> 00:16:33,471
and Judith.

284
00:16:36,916 --> 00:16:40,249
I'm thankful I'll be dead someday
and you'll all feel horrible

285
00:16:40,319 --> 00:16:42,014
you weren't nicer to me.

286
00:16:45,157 --> 00:16:46,988
And I'm thankful that our daughter

287
00:16:47,093 --> 00:16:49,994
gave us at least one grandchild
before she...

288
00:16:53,866 --> 00:16:55,857
I'm thankful I finally found a therapist

289
00:16:55,968 --> 00:16:59,335
who has no compunction
about prescribing powerful sedatives.

290
00:16:59,438 --> 00:17:02,635
I'm thankful I can sit here
and listen to you rich people whine

291
00:17:02,708 --> 00:17:06,667
while my family's scrabbling
for a corn dog at the Pomona Fairgrounds.

292
00:17:12,151 --> 00:17:14,642
- Charlie?
- No, you first.

293
00:17:18,357 --> 00:17:20,291
I'm thankful for you,

294
00:17:21,394 --> 00:17:23,794
and I hope you'll always be my friend.

295
00:17:24,997 --> 00:17:28,330
Okay, well, I'm thankful for you, too.

296
00:17:28,801 --> 00:17:32,202
And I'm thankful for everybody
coming together today

297
00:17:32,338 --> 00:17:35,364
as unwitting participants
in my desperate charade.

298
00:17:38,811 --> 00:17:39,903
Amen.

299
00:17:42,848 --> 00:17:45,476
Okay, maybe I should carve the turkey.

300
00:17:45,551 --> 00:17:46,984
I'll handle that for you, Son.

301
00:17:47,053 --> 00:17:49,817
- No, you both sit down. I'll do it.
- No, Mom, I can do it.

302
00:17:49,889 --> 00:17:51,083
No, don't be ridiculous.

303
00:17:51,190 --> 00:17:54,182
- No, I insist. I would love to.
- I appreciate the hospitality.

304
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:56,490
Okay, everybody, stop!

305
00:17:57,563 --> 00:17:59,258
Mom, give me the knife.

306
00:18:00,066 --> 00:18:03,502
Charlie, don't be silly.
You don't know how to carve a turkey.

307
00:18:03,569 --> 00:18:05,833
Maybe not,
but I'm the head of this household,

308
00:18:05,905 --> 00:18:08,840
and the head of the household
is supposed to carve the turkey.

309
00:18:08,908 --> 00:18:11,206
Why, because you saw it
on some TV show?

310
00:18:11,277 --> 00:18:15,907
- I swear, you are just like your father.
- No, I am not just not like my father.

311
00:18:16,082 --> 00:18:18,607
My father was afraid of you, and I'm not

312
00:18:19,618 --> 00:18:20,744
anymore:

313
00:18:22,588 --> 00:18:24,920
Okay, there was one unresolved issue.

314
00:18:25,691 --> 00:18:29,354
Charlie, now you're being foolish.
Give me the knife and sit down.

315
00:18:29,428 --> 00:18:30,725
Back off, lady.

316
00:18:33,032 --> 00:18:36,263
Every Thanksgiving,
you took the knife away from Dad,

317
00:18:36,368 --> 00:18:39,201
and when you did that,
you took away his manhood.

318
00:18:39,438 --> 00:18:42,032
You're not gonna take it away from me.

319
00:18:42,341 --> 00:18:45,242
There, see, it's carved.

320
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:51,349
It's carved with my manhood.

321
00:18:57,022 --> 00:18:59,388
I don't think I'm very hungry anymore.

322
00:19:00,092 --> 00:19:01,354
Lisa, marry me.

323
00:19:02,194 --> 00:19:06,290
- Marry you? You want me to marry you?
- Yes,

324
00:19:06,632 --> 00:19:08,395
you know, eventually.

325
00:19:14,507 --> 00:19:17,408
You sure you don't want
some turkey for the road?

326
00:19:17,643 --> 00:19:19,201
No, I'm fine.

327
00:19:20,746 --> 00:19:22,873
So, are you gonna invite me
to your wedding?

328
00:19:22,948 --> 00:19:24,438
Charlie.

329
00:19:24,550 --> 00:19:27,451
Will you at least call me
when you get divorced?

330
00:19:27,553 --> 00:19:29,384
You'll be first on my list.

331
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:38,929
- For what it's worth, I do love you.
- I know that.

332
00:19:43,435 --> 00:19:46,336
- Best of luck.
