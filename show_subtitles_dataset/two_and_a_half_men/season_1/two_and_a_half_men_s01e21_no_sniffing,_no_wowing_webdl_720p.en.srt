1
00:00:02,890 --> 00:00:05,932
These divorce lawyers have
a good business, don't they?

2
00:00:05,933 --> 00:00:10,455
Yeah, in the same way
locusts have a good business.

3
00:00:13,301 --> 00:00:16,094
Smells good. So does the coffee.

4
00:00:17,913 --> 00:00:21,528
Charlie, stop sniffing the paralegals.

5
00:00:21,693 --> 00:00:23,934
Look,
I am paying my attorney by the hour,

6
00:00:23,935 --> 00:00:25,471
so just speak when spoken to

7
00:00:25,472 --> 00:00:29,306
and otherwise, you know, just shut up.

8
00:00:30,181 --> 00:00:33,703
If you'd listened to me in the first place,
you wouldn't be in this mess.

9
00:00:33,704 --> 00:00:35,625
I'm the one who told you not to marry her.

10
00:00:35,626 --> 00:00:38,893
You're also the one who told me
that if I jumped off the garage roof

11
00:00:38,894 --> 00:00:43,729
with a bath towel tied around my neck,
I could fly to school.

12
00:00:43,730 --> 00:00:45,619
The one time you listened to me.

13
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:48,342
Let me tell you another thing.
If I hadn't married Judith,

14
00:00:48,343 --> 00:00:49,559
there'd be no Jake.

15
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:52,665
I didn't say you couldn't knock her up.

16
00:00:52,666 --> 00:00:55,004
Okay, let's get started.

17
00:00:55,005 --> 00:00:57,022
- Wow!
- No.

18
00:00:57,023 --> 00:01:00,856
No wowing. No sniffing, no wowing.

19
00:01:01,988 --> 00:01:04,165
- Laura Lang.
- Charlie Harper.

20
00:01:04,166 --> 00:01:07,432
- Didn't you used to date Superman?
- That's Lana Lang.

21
00:01:07,433 --> 00:01:09,193
She was Superboy's girlfriend.

22
00:01:09,194 --> 00:01:12,461
And guys have been using that tired
old line on me since the fifth grade.

23
00:01:12,462 --> 00:01:14,254
Did it ever work?

24
00:01:14,255 --> 00:01:18,098
- Let's just get down to business, okay?
- Okay.

25
00:01:18,099 --> 00:01:21,017
Didn't the Titanic bang into her?

26
00:01:21,431 --> 00:01:23,992
Okay, Mr. Harper,
the reason I wanted to see you is

27
00:01:23,993 --> 00:01:26,394
because your brother is involved
in a divorce action

28
00:01:26,395 --> 00:01:28,797
where the custody of his son
might become an issue.

29
00:01:28,798 --> 00:01:30,238
Really? Why?

30
00:01:30,239 --> 00:01:32,864
Because Jake stays
with his father part-time,

31
00:01:32,865 --> 00:01:35,747
his father lives with you,
and in the words of his mother,

32
00:01:35,748 --> 00:01:38,118
you are, hang on, I want to get this right.

33
00:01:38,119 --> 00:01:40,606
Here it is, "A sleaze ball."

34
00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:43,724
Yeah. So?

35
00:01:43,724 --> 00:01:46,414
So she might try to take Jake
out of your home.

36
00:01:46,415 --> 00:01:48,825
Why? It's a beautiful home.

37
00:01:49,138 --> 00:01:52,949
You should really come see it
some evening.

38
00:01:54,614 --> 00:01:57,913
It's in Malibu. Right on the beach.

39
00:01:59,675 --> 00:02:03,455
My point is, if Mrs. Harper decides
to make an issue out of your lifestyle

40
00:02:03,456 --> 00:02:04,704
we need to be prepared.

41
00:02:04,705 --> 00:02:06,081
What's wrong with my lifestyle?

42
00:02:06,082 --> 00:02:09,700
No, we are not going down that road
at $300 an hour.

43
00:02:09,701 --> 00:02:11,046
Relax, Alan.

44
00:02:11,047 --> 00:02:14,473
I'm going to need to know every possible
thing they can use against us.

45
00:02:14,474 --> 00:02:18,084
- Every skeleton in your closet.
- Oh, boy.

46
00:02:18,766 --> 00:02:21,232
So what,
you want to know about my sex life?

47
00:02:21,232 --> 00:02:25,300
Your sex life, your drinking,
your gambling, partying.

48
00:02:25,301 --> 00:02:27,701
On the beach.

49
00:02:28,407 --> 00:02:30,777
Mr. Harper.

50
00:02:30,777 --> 00:02:33,659
I'm sorry. But isn't that kind
of an invasion of my privacy?

51
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:35,742
It is, and I apologize for that.

52
00:02:35,742 --> 00:02:40,258
But I handle a lot of divorces,
and believe me, they can get nasty.

53
00:02:40,259 --> 00:02:43,781
Look, I've got to be in court.
So why don't you give this some thought,

54
00:02:43,782 --> 00:02:49,091
and when you gather
the information we need, give me a call.

55
00:02:51,021 --> 00:02:54,938
Okay. Starting from now
and working backward,

56
00:02:54,961 --> 00:02:58,477
I've slept with my brother's attorney...

57
00:03:09,567 --> 00:03:12,716
So, Laura, let me ask you something.

58
00:03:12,739 --> 00:03:16,805
The other day in your office,
you didn't seem to like me much.

59
00:03:16,806 --> 00:03:22,411
I was just wondering what caused you to
drive over here, you know, mostly naked?

60
00:03:22,412 --> 00:03:25,614
Charlie,
I don't have to like you to want you.

61
00:03:25,615 --> 00:03:28,015
Right on.

62
00:03:31,285 --> 00:03:34,807
For the record,
I don't like you much either.

63
00:03:34,808 --> 00:03:37,208
Right on.

64
00:03:39,324 --> 00:03:41,724
Another question.

65
00:03:42,432 --> 00:03:45,089
Seeing as how you're my brother's lawyer
and all,

66
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:48,324
is what we're doing here,
what's the word, unethical?

67
00:03:48,325 --> 00:03:50,598
Oh, God, yes.

68
00:03:50,599 --> 00:03:52,999
Right on.

69
00:03:53,450 --> 00:03:55,371
Listen, Charlie.

70
00:03:55,372 --> 00:03:58,767
I totally get who you are.
You date lots of women, you're a player.

71
00:03:58,768 --> 00:04:03,251
- That's fine. I don't care.
- You are very special.

72
00:04:03,252 --> 00:04:05,717
I just have one little request.

73
00:04:05,718 --> 00:04:08,183
You can pretty much
have anything you want right now.

74
00:04:08,184 --> 00:04:11,515
If your brother found out about us,
he could sue me for malpractice.

75
00:04:11,516 --> 00:04:12,924
I'm taking a big risk here.

76
00:04:12,925 --> 00:04:18,305
- Man, this just keeps getting hotter.
- But I need you to do something for me.

77
00:04:18,306 --> 00:04:22,469
When I call you, when I want you,
you've got to be there.

78
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:26,817
Okay. Let's practice. Hello?

79
00:04:27,243 --> 00:04:29,883
- Hey, Laura. What's up?
- Now.

80
00:04:29,901 --> 00:04:32,301
Right on.

81
00:04:37,076 --> 00:04:40,462
- Hello? Charlie?
- No.

82
00:04:42,073 --> 00:04:45,980
Sorry,
but I'm gonna have to speed this up.

83
00:04:46,302 --> 00:04:47,678
Charlie, relax.

84
00:04:47,679 --> 00:04:50,881
Just go downstairs
and distract him while I sneak out.

85
00:04:50,882 --> 00:04:53,732
- You're going to leave?
- I'm done.

86
00:04:53,733 --> 00:04:56,555
No cuddling, no sharing feelings?

87
00:04:56,647 --> 00:05:00,330
- I think I'm starting to like you.
- Save the sweet talk.

88
00:05:00,331 --> 00:05:01,803
Just remember our deal.

89
00:05:01,804 --> 00:05:04,206
You know, it suddenly occurs to me,

90
00:05:04,207 --> 00:05:06,800
I'm usually the one sneaking out
when the man gets home.

91
00:05:06,801 --> 00:05:08,626
Charlie, go.

92
00:05:08,627 --> 00:05:11,161
I thought it was a fun fact.

93
00:05:13,816 --> 00:05:15,608
- Hi, Uncle Charlie.
- Hey, buddy.

94
00:05:15,609 --> 00:05:18,652
- You're here early.
- Teacher's conference, half day.

95
00:05:18,653 --> 00:05:20,861
- Where you going?
- Looking for my Gameboy.

96
00:05:20,862 --> 00:05:25,346
Forget your Gameboy.
It's a beautiful day. Go watch TV.

97
00:05:25,347 --> 00:05:31,432
I don't want to watch TV. I want to play
my Gameboy, and it's in your room.

98
00:05:31,433 --> 00:05:34,827
The parental code that unlocks
the pay channels is one-two-three-four.

99
00:05:34,828 --> 00:05:38,332
One-two-three-four. I should have known.

100
00:05:39,922 --> 00:05:42,354
I'm sorry.
Did I interrupt your late-morning nap,

101
00:05:42,355 --> 00:05:44,020
or your early-afternoon nap?

102
00:05:44,021 --> 00:05:46,421
I don't nap. I recharge.

103
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:50,510
- Can I get you a beer?
- Sure, thanks.

104
00:05:51,164 --> 00:05:52,509
Come on.

105
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:55,103
Hang on.
Alan Harper for Laura Lang, please.

106
00:05:55,104 --> 00:05:57,089
- What are you doing?
- I'm calling my lawyer.

107
00:05:57,090 --> 00:05:59,075
Why?
I thought we were going to have a beer.

108
00:05:59,076 --> 00:06:01,253
Judith is demanding half
of my book collection.

109
00:06:01,254 --> 00:06:02,342
Oh, man.

110
00:06:02,343 --> 00:06:06,121
- Sounds like you need a beer.
- They are rare first editions, Charlie.

111
00:06:06,122 --> 00:06:07,242
Very valuable.

112
00:06:07,243 --> 00:06:09,549
Okay, you don't need
to get your lawyer involved.

113
00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:11,887
You still got your old garage door clicker,
right?

114
00:06:11,888 --> 00:06:14,033
- Yeah.
- So let Judith have the books.

115
00:06:14,034 --> 00:06:17,556
Then one night,
maybe someone goes and gets them back.

116
00:06:17,557 --> 00:06:19,415
Wonderful. Breaking and entering.

117
00:06:19,416 --> 00:06:23,931
- It's not breaking if you have the clicker.
- More good advice.

118
00:06:23,932 --> 00:06:25,725
And it's free.

119
00:06:25,726 --> 00:06:29,088
- So hang up, and let's get that beer.
- Sure, I'll hold.

120
00:06:29,089 --> 00:06:33,687
Yeah, they're patching me through
to her cell phone.

121
00:06:33,989 --> 00:06:35,334
What's that?

122
00:06:35,335 --> 00:06:39,016
That is coincidentally my cell phone.

123
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:43,020
- Excuse me.
- Hi, Alan.

124
00:06:43,599 --> 00:06:46,700
- Don't answer.
- What's up?

125
00:06:47,123 --> 00:06:49,556
- What are you doing?
- Hang on, Alan.

126
00:06:49,557 --> 00:06:51,766
I'm making a living, Charlie.

127
00:06:51,767 --> 00:06:53,848
I thought you were worried
about malpractice.

128
00:06:53,849 --> 00:06:56,763
I'm more worried about billable hours.

129
00:06:56,764 --> 00:07:00,287
Can you prove you acquired the books
in question prior to the marriage?

130
00:07:00,288 --> 00:07:02,688
- Charlie?
- Coming!

131
00:07:03,106 --> 00:07:06,972
- Why are you shushing me? Hang on.
- What?

132
00:07:07,046 --> 00:07:09,928
- I'm on the phone with Laura.
- Say hi for me.

133
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:14,155
- Give it up, Charlie. She doesn't like you.
- True.

134
00:07:14,156 --> 00:07:18,255
You'll testify that I bought all my first
edition books before I got married, right?

135
00:07:18,256 --> 00:07:19,377
- Did you?
- No.

136
00:07:19,378 --> 00:07:22,836
- Then I'm your man.
- I can prove it. Charlie's my witness.

137
00:07:22,837 --> 00:07:26,712
- What happened to the TV?
- There's nothing dirty on.

138
00:07:26,713 --> 00:07:29,307
- I'm going to go play my Gameboy.
- No.

139
00:07:29,308 --> 00:07:32,413
Wait right here. I'll get it for you.

140
00:07:32,414 --> 00:07:34,720
Of course he's credible.

141
00:07:34,721 --> 00:07:35,937
I don't know, Alan.

142
00:07:35,938 --> 00:07:42,773
If the right lawyer gets their hands on him,
they could really make him sweat.

143
00:07:42,921 --> 00:07:44,457
Yeah, very funny.

144
00:07:44,458 --> 00:07:46,923
Have you seen a Gameboy
anywhere around here?

145
00:07:46,924 --> 00:07:49,005
Okay,
we'll just have to do the best we can.

146
00:07:49,006 --> 00:07:52,144
I'll tell him exactly what to do
and who knows,

147
00:07:52,145 --> 00:07:54,756
maybe he'll get the job done.

148
00:07:56,341 --> 00:07:58,741
I got the job done twice.

149
00:07:59,865 --> 00:08:01,914
Why don't you let me talk to him?

150
00:08:01,915 --> 00:08:04,315
Charlie?

151
00:08:06,559 --> 00:08:08,959
Why?

152
00:08:14,086 --> 00:08:18,195
- Where's my Gameboy?
- I'll buy you a new one.

153
00:08:18,315 --> 00:08:20,812
She wants to talk to you. Keep it short.

154
00:08:20,813 --> 00:08:24,656
Alan, if I could keep it short,
my life would be so much simpler.

155
00:08:24,657 --> 00:08:27,057
- Hello?
- Now.

156
00:08:27,091 --> 00:08:29,491
What?

157
00:08:29,622 --> 00:08:32,046
I want you now.

158
00:08:33,177 --> 00:08:34,617
You've gotta be kidding.

159
00:08:34,618 --> 00:08:39,711
Charlie, I'm paying her by the hour.
Just listen to her and do what she says.

160
00:08:39,712 --> 00:08:43,158
You're the boss. I'll get right on it.

161
00:08:43,556 --> 00:08:45,508
What did she say?

162
00:08:45,509 --> 00:08:47,558
She wants me to write a statement.

163
00:08:47,559 --> 00:08:51,082
And she wants you to take Jake out
and buy him a new Gameboy.

164
00:08:51,083 --> 00:08:52,203
Why would she want that?

165
00:08:52,204 --> 00:08:54,413
For God's sake, Alan,
you're paying this woman

166
00:08:54,414 --> 00:08:58,551
a lot of money.
I suggest you take her advice.

167
00:08:58,931 --> 00:09:01,331
Jake, we're going out.

168
00:09:02,422 --> 00:09:05,560
I just want to make it clear
that I would never behave in a way

169
00:09:05,561 --> 00:09:08,731
that would negatively influence
my nephew.

170
00:09:08,732 --> 00:09:11,069
What was that? Is she allowed to do that?

171
00:09:11,070 --> 00:09:13,536
Mr. Harper,
how many women would you say

172
00:09:13,537 --> 00:09:16,418
you have sexual relations with
in any given year?

173
00:09:16,419 --> 00:09:18,819
Excuse me.

174
00:09:24,459 --> 00:09:26,859
I do okay.

175
00:09:27,470 --> 00:09:29,807
Ten, twenty, one hundred?

176
00:09:29,808 --> 00:09:33,203
- Come on, I don't keep count.
- So we'll say, 10.

177
00:09:33,203 --> 00:09:34,868
I don't see the relevance of this.

178
00:09:34,869 --> 00:09:37,430
We are trying to establish
Mr. Harper's lifestyle

179
00:09:37,431 --> 00:09:40,730
as a way of determining whether
his home is a suitable environment

180
00:09:40,731 --> 00:09:41,851
for a young boy.

181
00:09:41,852 --> 00:09:43,900
Okay,
let me just say here that I love Jake

182
00:09:43,901 --> 00:09:47,296
and I make it my business to see
that nothing goes on in front of him

183
00:09:47,297 --> 00:09:50,852
- that is in any way inappropriate.
- You tell him, Charlie.

184
00:09:50,853 --> 00:09:53,924
And it's significantly north of 10.

185
00:09:59,437 --> 00:10:04,113
I think we can move on.
Do you have any more questions?

186
00:10:04,114 --> 00:10:07,378
- You are doing very well.
- Thanks.

187
00:10:09,271 --> 00:10:13,946
Mr. Harper, is it true that Jake saw
a woman in the shower with you?

188
00:10:13,947 --> 00:10:16,347
Okay, yes.

189
00:10:16,477 --> 00:10:19,872
Now in that instance,
the door was closed,

190
00:10:19,873 --> 00:10:21,281
he didn't knock,

191
00:10:21,282 --> 00:10:24,897
and the door was closed and...

192
00:10:26,503 --> 00:10:29,777
And I'm sorry, what was the question?

193
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:34,684
- Woman in the shower?
- Don't help them.

194
00:10:35,728 --> 00:10:38,898
And most important,
he didn't see anything inappropriate.

195
00:10:38,899 --> 00:10:44,285
Then, what can you tell us
about this picture that Jake drew?

196
00:10:47,356 --> 00:10:51,752
Okay, now that's a totally different...
Whoa, man!

197
00:10:52,833 --> 00:10:55,233
Whoa-man. Woman.

198
00:10:56,932 --> 00:10:59,686
She was in my kitchen wearing a T-shirt

199
00:10:59,687 --> 00:11:02,327
and she reached up for some...

200
00:11:04,492 --> 00:11:06,892
SpaghettiOs.

201
00:11:07,727 --> 00:11:10,609
That's what she was reaching for.

202
00:11:10,610 --> 00:11:14,594
I'd like a moment
to confer with my witness.

203
00:11:15,287 --> 00:11:18,705
You are making me so hot.

204
00:11:19,771 --> 00:11:22,171
I see.

205
00:11:22,589 --> 00:11:28,546
Look, Stuart, we both know
you're on a fishing expedition here, right?

206
00:11:28,547 --> 00:11:30,947
- Maybe.
- Maybe?

207
00:11:31,302 --> 00:11:35,081
You have no case.
This man is a wonderful uncle.

208
00:11:35,082 --> 00:11:36,746
He provides a beautiful home,

209
00:11:36,747 --> 00:11:38,155
and the last time I looked,

210
00:11:38,156 --> 00:11:41,775
it wasn't against the law to be single
in the United States of America.

211
00:11:41,776 --> 00:11:44,176
Oh, God!

212
00:11:46,581 --> 00:11:48,981
Bless America!

213
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:52,760
Amen.

214
00:11:55,549 --> 00:11:58,656
The good news is your wife has given up
on the custody issue,

215
00:11:58,656 --> 00:12:01,090
but we still need to finalize
the property settlement.

216
00:12:01,091 --> 00:12:02,179
All right.

217
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:05,670
Now, aside from your books,
she's requested a few other specific items.

218
00:12:05,671 --> 00:12:08,674
- Like what?
- A massage chair?

219
00:12:08,747 --> 00:12:12,020
Oh, no. Forget it. I love that chair.

220
00:12:12,622 --> 00:12:17,170
That was the only thing in my bedroom
that moved when I touched it.

221
00:12:17,171 --> 00:12:19,283
Don't worry, Alan.
I will get you your chair.

222
00:12:19,284 --> 00:12:22,519
I will get you your books.
I will fight for you. I will win for you.

223
00:12:22,519 --> 00:12:26,939
And I won't stop until your wife
is squished like a bug on a windshield.

224
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:31,744
Okay, let's not lose sight of the fact
that this bug is the mother of my child.

225
00:12:31,745 --> 00:12:34,691
So let's just keep the squishing
to a minimum.

226
00:12:34,692 --> 00:12:37,413
Don't worry, you don't need a bathing suit.

227
00:12:37,414 --> 00:12:40,649
Once you're drunk,
the ocean's not cold at all.

228
00:12:40,650 --> 00:12:43,049
- Charlie.
- Hey, Alan.

229
00:12:45,422 --> 00:12:47,791
And Laura.

230
00:12:47,792 --> 00:12:50,192
Hello, Laura.

231
00:12:50,643 --> 00:12:52,115
I didn't know you were here.

232
00:12:52,116 --> 00:12:54,934
- Hi, Charlie, Crystal.
- Hey.

233
00:12:56,665 --> 00:13:00,092
Yeah, I guess you guys know each other.

234
00:13:00,957 --> 00:13:03,357
How's that flu?

235
00:13:03,487 --> 00:13:05,887
It's better.

236
00:13:08,196 --> 00:13:11,978
This calls for a drink. A very large drink.

237
00:13:14,186 --> 00:13:18,372
I'm not getting billed for her time now,
am l?

238
00:13:25,589 --> 00:13:27,061
Charlie?

239
00:13:27,062 --> 00:13:28,855
Okay, I know this is awkward,

240
00:13:28,856 --> 00:13:30,841
but let's keep in mind we agreed

241
00:13:30,842 --> 00:13:35,422
that you and I were just a casual deal, two
consenting adults, no strings, no drama.

242
00:13:35,423 --> 00:13:38,528
I'm willing to admit
that trying to boink your assistant might...

243
00:13:38,529 --> 00:13:40,929
- Charlie!
- Yeah?

244
00:13:41,637 --> 00:13:43,653
Now.

245
00:13:43,654 --> 00:13:44,967
What?

246
00:13:44,968 --> 00:13:47,752
I want you now.

247
00:13:48,299 --> 00:13:52,846
But see, now's really not a good time.
I mean, you're working with my brother

248
00:13:52,847 --> 00:13:55,333
and Crystal took a sick day.

249
00:13:58,773 --> 00:14:01,173
Okay, that's a good point.

250
00:14:01,752 --> 00:14:04,152
Let me think this through.

251
00:14:05,627 --> 00:14:08,157
All right,
there's just one way to make this work.

252
00:14:08,158 --> 00:14:10,591
I don't do threesomes, Charlie.

253
00:14:10,592 --> 00:14:13,859
- Then I'm stumped.
- What's going on?

254
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:16,004
Nothing. Not a thing.

255
00:14:16,005 --> 00:14:19,144
- Charlie, there's no reason to lie.
- Are you sure?

256
00:14:19,145 --> 00:14:21,544
There usually is.

257
00:14:21,835 --> 00:14:25,614
I'm a little upset with your brother
for getting involved with my assistant.

258
00:14:25,615 --> 00:14:28,177
I mean,
it could be construed as a breach of ethics.

259
00:14:28,178 --> 00:14:30,803
Nice going, Charlie.
This won't affect my case, will it?

260
00:14:30,804 --> 00:14:32,886
No, of course not, Alan. I'm a professional.

261
00:14:32,887 --> 00:14:36,088
If we're going to make it
to that settlement conference on time

262
00:14:36,089 --> 00:14:39,579
maybe you should put on a jacket and tie.
Nothing too nice.

263
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:40,669
You're good.

264
00:14:40,670 --> 00:14:45,505
Do you think you can keep it
in your pants till I get my stuff back?

265
00:14:45,506 --> 00:14:48,425
I'm trying harder than you think.

266
00:14:50,119 --> 00:14:52,841
Okay, we've got 15 minutes.
Where do you want to do this?

267
00:14:52,841 --> 00:14:55,083
Hold on.

268
00:14:55,084 --> 00:14:59,625
It's not that I'm not into risky,
semi-public sex,

269
00:15:00,208 --> 00:15:04,051
it's just that I am starting to resent
your attitude.

270
00:15:04,052 --> 00:15:06,452
Charlie, we have a deal.

271
00:15:06,487 --> 00:15:08,886
Okay, Laura, look.

272
00:15:10,234 --> 00:15:12,795
I only went along with that because

273
00:15:12,796 --> 00:15:17,846
you are hot,
and it took little to no effort on my part.

274
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:24,691
Just make yourself at home, Crystal.
That's the ocean.

275
00:15:27,852 --> 00:15:31,202
Anyway, I think we might be done here.

276
00:15:31,439 --> 00:15:33,839
- You're dumping me?
- Yep.

277
00:15:34,674 --> 00:15:37,074
Now.

278
00:15:37,845 --> 00:15:42,011
You are going to be very sorry,
Charlie Harper.

279
00:15:46,429 --> 00:15:53,059
Yeah, girls have been using that tired
old line on me since the fifth grade.

280
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:57,928
The next item is the rare book collection
appraised at $12,000.

281
00:15:57,929 --> 00:16:00,683
Actually,
our appraisers came in at $16,500.

282
00:16:00,684 --> 00:16:03,084
- Yeah.
- Enjoy them.

283
00:16:07,154 --> 00:16:08,273
What?

284
00:16:08,274 --> 00:16:11,381
- I was only asking for half.
- Why break up a collection?

285
00:16:11,382 --> 00:16:13,175
Okay, what's next?

286
00:16:13,176 --> 00:16:15,833
I understand there's a dispute
over the massage chair.

287
00:16:15,834 --> 00:16:17,659
Not anymore. We concede.

288
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:20,157
What do you mean we concede?
We're not here for conceding.

289
00:16:20,158 --> 00:16:23,072
We're here for fighting and winning
and squishing, remember?

290
00:16:23,073 --> 00:16:27,396
- Alan, I know what I'm doing.
- Okay, moving on to the retirement fund.

291
00:16:27,397 --> 00:16:28,517
- Take it.
- Take it?

292
00:16:28,518 --> 00:16:30,407
- Take it.
- I'll take it.

293
00:16:30,408 --> 00:16:32,073
Are you out of your mind?

294
00:16:32,074 --> 00:16:35,962
- Okay, what else would you like?
- What else?

295
00:16:36,366 --> 00:16:42,385
Judith, for God's sake, remember
there was a time when you loved me!

296
00:16:56,418 --> 00:16:58,818
Cool.

297
00:17:01,671 --> 00:17:02,791
That was quick.

298
00:17:02,792 --> 00:17:06,833
Yeah,
like every other time Judith screwed me.

299
00:17:10,351 --> 00:17:13,264
- What happened?
- I'll tell you what happened.

300
00:17:13,265 --> 00:17:18,555
My settlement conference turned
in to a drive-by colonoscopy.

301
00:17:19,992 --> 00:17:22,458
Charlie, have you ever heard
of a divorce agreement

302
00:17:22,459 --> 00:17:24,091
that requires the ex-husband

303
00:17:24,092 --> 00:17:28,319
- to pay the ex-wife's dry cleaning for life?
- Wow.

304
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:30,209
Yeah, not just clothes.

305
00:17:30,210 --> 00:17:32,610
Drapes, rugs,

306
00:17:32,708 --> 00:17:35,941
slip covers, even suede.

307
00:17:37,257 --> 00:17:41,500
Sounds like she really took you
to the cleaners.

308
00:17:41,997 --> 00:17:43,822
Sorry.

309
00:17:43,823 --> 00:17:47,121
So I fired Laura
and tore up the agreement.

310
00:17:47,122 --> 00:17:50,229
I'm going to have to find a new attorney
and just start all over.

311
00:17:50,230 --> 00:17:52,793
Good, then. No harm, no foul.

312
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:56,603
Except for the thousands of dollars
of extra legal fees.

313
00:17:56,604 --> 00:17:58,684
Yeah, that's got to sting a little.

314
00:17:58,685 --> 00:18:03,810
Not as much as having to buy Judith's
parents a retirement condo in Boca Raton.

315
00:18:03,811 --> 00:18:08,166
She didn't even ask for that.
Laura just threw it in.

316
00:18:08,167 --> 00:18:10,120
Lawyers.

317
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:12,586
But you know what
the interesting thing is?

318
00:18:12,587 --> 00:18:14,028
No, what?

319
00:18:14,029 --> 00:18:15,565
After it was all over

320
00:18:15,566 --> 00:18:19,761
and Judith and her attorney
went dancing out of the room,

321
00:18:19,762 --> 00:18:22,708
I asked Laura
why she had done this to me,

322
00:18:22,709 --> 00:18:26,836
and she said, and I quote,
"Ask your brother."

323
00:18:30,237 --> 00:18:33,469
So here I am asking you.

324
00:18:34,817 --> 00:18:37,217
Why, Charlie?

325
00:18:37,987 --> 00:18:43,834
Why did my very expensive
Beverly Hills divorce lawyer sell me out?

326
00:18:45,451 --> 00:18:48,648
Okay. I'll tell you the whole story.

327
00:18:49,295 --> 00:18:52,444
But maybe you should sit down first.
