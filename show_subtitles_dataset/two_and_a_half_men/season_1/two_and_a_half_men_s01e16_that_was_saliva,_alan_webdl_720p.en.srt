1
00:00:01,891 --> 00:00:03,324
Let's get out of here, Charlie.

2
00:00:03,393 --> 00:00:05,258
You are not just going
to leave me here, are you?

3
00:00:05,328 --> 00:00:07,262
Here we are. Chez Charlie.

4
00:00:09,132 --> 00:00:12,363
- She's taking her clothes off.
- Is this a great country or what?

5
00:00:12,435 --> 00:00:13,925
You guys are so cute.

6
00:00:14,037 --> 00:00:15,061
Right back at you.

7
00:00:15,138 --> 00:00:17,436
Good, Charlie.
Keep hitting on the deranged woman.

8
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:20,407
Hey, Charlie, you're a really cool guy.

9
00:00:20,476 --> 00:00:22,637
But I'm not going to have sex with you.

10
00:00:22,745 --> 00:00:23,769
Ever?

11
00:00:25,949 --> 00:00:28,144
Deep tissue massage, pancakes.

12
00:00:28,251 --> 00:00:32,449
If you had a TV on your forehead and could
breathe through the ears you'd be perfect.

13
00:00:33,423 --> 00:00:36,586
You just assume that if we are both
interested in the same woman

14
00:00:36,659 --> 00:00:39,025
- you would come out on top?
- Of course I would.

15
00:00:39,095 --> 00:00:40,392
What are you afraid of?

16
00:00:40,463 --> 00:00:43,125
I'm afraid I'm going to hit you so hard
I'll be an only child.

17
00:00:43,199 --> 00:00:45,667
- Are you sure?
- It's settled. You are staying with us.

18
00:00:45,768 --> 00:00:48,032
Of course, we still don't know
a damn thing about her.

19
00:00:48,104 --> 00:00:49,503
I'm Joanie.

20
00:00:50,006 --> 00:00:51,200
Hi.

21
00:00:51,307 --> 00:00:53,832
We are going to go
to Charlie and Alan's house, hon.

22
00:00:53,943 --> 00:00:57,276
It's a wonderful place where
those awful people will never find us.

23
00:01:00,149 --> 00:01:01,946
So, Frankie,

24
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:04,880
why didn't you tell us you had a daughter?

25
00:01:05,688 --> 00:01:07,952
Okay, guys, here's the deal.

26
00:01:09,058 --> 00:01:10,525
I didn't want you to know.

27
00:01:12,462 --> 00:01:14,487
Okay. I feel better.

28
00:01:14,998 --> 00:01:17,023
I'm sorry, it's a long story.

29
00:01:17,133 --> 00:01:20,034
We got time. I'm not doing anything.
Alan, you doing anything?

30
00:01:20,136 --> 00:01:21,228
No, I'm free.

31
00:01:22,572 --> 00:01:25,700
I was staying with my grandma
and grandpa, who are really rich,

32
00:01:25,808 --> 00:01:28,902
and they don't want my mom to have me,
so they said she's crazy.

33
00:01:30,513 --> 00:01:31,844
That wasn't so long.

34
00:01:32,749 --> 00:01:37,812
- Can we please talk about this later?
- Okay. What shall we talk about?

35
00:01:38,821 --> 00:01:40,015
Are you guys gay?

36
00:01:43,693 --> 00:01:45,752
Isn't she something?

37
00:01:55,138 --> 00:01:57,265
Okay, here we are.

38
00:01:58,374 --> 00:02:00,638
This is it, right? One kid, no pets?

39
00:02:02,311 --> 00:02:03,403
As far as I know.

40
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:07,577
- Can I go look at the ocean?
- Sure, just stay on the deck.

41
00:02:12,555 --> 00:02:14,386
Okay, who has the first question?

42
00:02:17,493 --> 00:02:19,324
- Alan.
- Thank you.

43
00:02:21,831 --> 00:02:24,561
- What the hell is going on?
- Good one.

44
00:02:25,635 --> 00:02:29,264
Here it is. I married a really rich guy,
and his parents always hated me.

45
00:02:29,338 --> 00:02:31,465
I don't know.
Maybe it was because when we met,

46
00:02:31,574 --> 00:02:33,838
he was on the road
to becoming a U.S. Congressman

47
00:02:33,943 --> 00:02:36,776
and I was just, you know, on the road.

48
00:02:38,314 --> 00:02:40,111
Joanie, get off the railing.

49
00:02:40,349 --> 00:02:43,011
Anyway, they were not happy
when we got married,

50
00:02:43,119 --> 00:02:46,452
and they were even less happy
when we used part of his trust fund

51
00:02:46,522 --> 00:02:47,921
to finance my recording career.

52
00:02:47,990 --> 00:02:50,982
- You're a singer?
- Well, as it turns out, no. But...

53
00:02:53,529 --> 00:02:55,087
Then two years ago, Brad died.

54
00:02:55,164 --> 00:02:58,463
And ever since, his parents have been
trying to take Joanie away from me.

55
00:02:58,534 --> 00:03:00,695
- So, the psychiatrist...
- Court ordered.

56
00:03:00,803 --> 00:03:03,636
They're suing me for custody,
saying I'm an unfit parent.

57
00:03:03,773 --> 00:03:05,331
- Unfit, how?
- You know...

58
00:03:08,611 --> 00:03:09,771
I'm not a lawyer,

59
00:03:09,846 --> 00:03:12,371
but taking a baseball bat
to the shrink's Beamer

60
00:03:12,482 --> 00:03:14,211
might not have helped your case.

61
00:03:14,951 --> 00:03:17,476
Yeah, they'll probably spin that one
in their favor.

62
00:03:17,553 --> 00:03:18,747
But I was screwed anyway

63
00:03:18,821 --> 00:03:21,221
because they were paying him
to make me look bad.

64
00:03:21,324 --> 00:03:23,656
- That's horrible.
- So what are your plans now?

65
00:03:23,726 --> 00:03:26,854
I don't know. I didn't think past
just getting her out of there.

66
00:03:26,963 --> 00:03:27,987
You don't have to know.

67
00:03:28,064 --> 00:03:30,328
You can stay here for a while
and figure it out. Right?

68
00:03:30,399 --> 00:03:32,959
- Absolutely.
- Thank you.

69
00:03:33,035 --> 00:03:35,902
That'd be great. I'll go tell Joanie.

70
00:03:36,672 --> 00:03:39,869
Terrific. We're happy to have you.

71
00:03:41,811 --> 00:03:43,711
Okay, we've got to get her out of here.

72
00:03:45,681 --> 00:03:47,808
- Charlie, she needs us.
- She doesn't need us.

73
00:03:47,884 --> 00:03:50,546
She needs a lawyer
and probably a new shrink.

74
00:03:51,354 --> 00:03:53,219
Well, then we'll get her those.

75
00:03:53,322 --> 00:03:56,086
At this point, I think I'd like
to stop using the word "we. "

76
00:03:56,192 --> 00:03:57,523
You're going to bail on her?

77
00:03:57,593 --> 00:03:59,925
Two days ago,
you couldn't wait to get her in bed.

78
00:04:00,029 --> 00:04:02,930
That's because two days ago,
she was just a crazy stranger.

79
00:04:03,032 --> 00:04:05,660
If I remember correctly,
you couldn't wait to get rid of her.

80
00:04:05,735 --> 00:04:07,532
Yes, because she was a crazy stranger.

81
00:04:07,603 --> 00:04:10,265
Now I've gotten to know her
and I want her to stay.

82
00:04:10,373 --> 00:04:14,104
All right, Alan, but I'm warning you.
This girl's got a lot of baggage.

83
00:04:14,210 --> 00:04:17,338
I don't know if you have enough
sky cabs to get her to the curb.

84
00:04:20,049 --> 00:04:21,073
What?

85
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:27,180
So, Joanie, what grade are you in?

86
00:04:27,256 --> 00:04:28,723
- Second.
- Really?

87
00:04:28,791 --> 00:04:31,021
- I have a little boy who's in fourth.
- So?

88
00:04:33,696 --> 00:04:37,359
I don't know. I thought it'd be germane
to the conversation.

89
00:04:39,235 --> 00:04:43,137
Wow. Doesn't matter how old they are,
you still strike out.

90
00:04:46,375 --> 00:04:49,572
You know, Joanie,
you are just as pretty as your mom.

91
00:04:49,745 --> 00:04:50,871
So?

92
00:04:52,281 --> 00:04:53,714
I bow to the master.

93
00:04:55,785 --> 00:04:57,275
Hold on, let me finish.

94
00:04:58,321 --> 00:05:00,687
All right,
I'm going to say this one more time

95
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:02,985
real slow so there's no confusion.

96
00:05:03,092 --> 00:05:04,616
You can take your damn money

97
00:05:04,694 --> 00:05:07,254
and stick it up
your "white bread, country club,

98
00:05:07,330 --> 00:05:09,696
"Tournament of Roses, liposuctioned" ass.

99
00:05:11,767 --> 00:05:14,099
Hi.

100
00:05:15,671 --> 00:05:19,664
- Really? I'm garbage.
- Is Alan here?

101
00:05:20,509 --> 00:05:22,340
Really? Is that right?

102
00:05:22,445 --> 00:05:25,972
Well, I got news for you, lady.
The term is white trash.

103
00:05:27,383 --> 00:05:30,375
- Do you know her?
- Nope, that's a new one.

104
00:05:31,487 --> 00:05:34,320
- Hi, Dad.
- Jake, Judith. What are you doing here?

105
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:37,325
Alan, I told you yesterday
I was going to visit my parents.

106
00:05:37,393 --> 00:05:39,122
Dad's having another colonoscopy.

107
00:05:39,195 --> 00:05:41,322
If I'm not there,
I'll have to watch the video.

108
00:05:41,397 --> 00:05:44,662
Yeah, right. I'm sorry.
There's just been a lot of stuff going on.

109
00:05:44,734 --> 00:05:47,134
Yeah. I just met your brother's latest stuff.

110
00:05:47,737 --> 00:05:50,467
- Why do you assume it's his stuff?
- What? Is it yours?

111
00:05:50,539 --> 00:05:52,166
No, but it's not his, either.

112
00:05:52,241 --> 00:05:54,835
- But it could be.
- Says who?

113
00:05:54,910 --> 00:05:56,138
Says your ex-wife.

114
00:05:56,212 --> 00:06:00,205
Okay, I really don't need to hear this.
Jake, honey, have a good time.

115
00:06:00,316 --> 00:06:02,181
Charlie, behave yourself.

116
00:06:03,085 --> 00:06:04,382
What about me?

117
00:06:04,487 --> 00:06:06,887
I am completely capable
of having my own stuff.

118
00:06:08,324 --> 00:06:12,693
- Hi, I'm Joanie.
- Hey. I'm going to go play in my room.

119
00:06:12,762 --> 00:06:14,662
- Can I come with you?
- Whatever.

120
00:06:16,265 --> 00:06:20,099
If he can just keep that attitude
for another 30 years, he's gold.

121
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:24,364
I'm not afraid of your lawyers
or your shrinks.

122
00:06:24,707 --> 00:06:27,198
Fine, bring them on,
because you know what?

123
00:06:27,276 --> 00:06:29,403
We're going to run away and hide.

124
00:06:30,846 --> 00:06:32,871
Now they're really unhappy with me.

125
00:06:32,948 --> 00:06:37,078
- Is there anything we can do?
- Thanks, you've already done so much.

126
00:06:37,186 --> 00:06:40,121
- I just hate to put you out like this.
- It is not a problem.

127
00:06:40,222 --> 00:06:43,248
We have plenty of space.
You and Joanie can stay in my room

128
00:06:43,359 --> 00:06:44,917
and I'll bunk with Charlie.

129
00:06:47,129 --> 00:06:49,029
You'll bunk with Charlie?

130
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:54,861
- Hold on there, Pecos Bill.
- No, it'll be fun.

131
00:06:54,937 --> 00:06:56,700
It'll be like when we were kids.

132
00:06:57,406 --> 00:06:58,771
Okay.

133
00:06:58,874 --> 00:07:02,708
But just remember, this time
Mom won't be around to hear you scream.

134
00:07:06,949 --> 00:07:08,576
Why are those people here?

135
00:07:08,718 --> 00:07:11,710
They're going through a tough time,
and we're helping them out.

136
00:07:11,787 --> 00:07:13,448
That girl is really annoying.

137
00:07:13,889 --> 00:07:18,986
- I think maybe she has a crush on you.
- Yeah, that's what's annoying.

138
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:24,732
- You don't really like girls yet?
- No, I like girls.

139
00:07:25,067 --> 00:07:26,796
Just not into eight-year-olds.

140
00:07:33,943 --> 00:07:35,433
Is Joanie okay?

141
00:07:35,644 --> 00:07:38,579
Yeah. She fell asleep
as soon as her head hit the pillow.

142
00:07:38,681 --> 00:07:41,275
- It was a long day for her.
- Yeah.

143
00:07:42,618 --> 00:07:45,519
The good news is
I think my in-laws are going to back off.

144
00:07:47,156 --> 00:07:49,454
The bad news is
that wasn't my shrink's car.

145
00:07:52,361 --> 00:07:54,158
Yeah, well, we all make mistakes.

146
00:07:55,331 --> 00:07:57,959
But at least you made this one
for the right reason.

147
00:07:58,033 --> 00:07:59,432
You love your daughter.

148
00:08:02,605 --> 00:08:04,835
I just wish I knew where to go from here.

149
00:08:05,775 --> 00:08:09,040
Because I know
I seem like I've got it all together,

150
00:08:11,647 --> 00:08:14,480
- but this is a little...
- Scary?

151
00:08:14,617 --> 00:08:16,983
Yeah. I understand.

152
00:08:17,052 --> 00:08:20,613
When my marriage ended, I was terrified.

153
00:08:22,324 --> 00:08:24,155
It's the unknown.

154
00:08:25,194 --> 00:08:30,222
- Yeah.
- No, don't cry.

155
00:08:32,501 --> 00:08:34,492
Everything will work out, you'll see.

156
00:09:00,029 --> 00:09:02,054
- What's the matter?
- I don't know.

157
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:06,898
It's been so long
since anybody's touched me.

158
00:09:09,472 --> 00:09:10,530
Come here.

159
00:09:46,190 --> 00:09:48,021
- Alan?
- Yeah?

160
00:09:48,192 --> 00:09:51,127
It's been so long
since anybody's touched me.

161
00:09:59,270 --> 00:10:00,828
How much did you see?

162
00:10:01,505 --> 00:10:03,803
Just enough to make sleep impossible.

163
00:10:06,043 --> 00:10:09,012
Okay, that's great.
I am dying to talk about this.

164
00:10:10,948 --> 00:10:13,348
All we did was kiss,
but, Charlie, what a kiss.

165
00:10:13,450 --> 00:10:15,884
It was like our souls were merging.

166
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:19,783
- That was saliva, Alan.
- No, seriously.

167
00:10:19,857 --> 00:10:22,155
I mean, Frankie is incredible.
Think about it.

168
00:10:22,226 --> 00:10:25,753
First she loses her husband, then
she has to fight to keep her daughter,

169
00:10:25,830 --> 00:10:29,288
and yet, still she has such incredible spirit,
such joie de vivre.

170
00:10:29,366 --> 00:10:31,891
Okay,
would you like to hear my take on this?

171
00:10:32,303 --> 00:10:34,066
Is it positive and life affirming?

172
00:10:35,573 --> 00:10:36,733
Good night, Alan.

173
00:10:38,042 --> 00:10:40,033
Okay, no. Tell me what you think.

174
00:10:40,811 --> 00:10:41,869
All right.

175
00:10:41,979 --> 00:10:45,540
I've known you all your life,
and if there's one thing I've noticed,

176
00:10:45,649 --> 00:10:48,209
you are a stone sucker
for the damsel in distress.

177
00:10:48,319 --> 00:10:50,844
- I am not.
- Come on, Alan.

178
00:10:50,921 --> 00:10:53,014
Every woman
you've ever been involved with

179
00:10:53,090 --> 00:10:54,352
has been damaged and needy.

180
00:10:54,425 --> 00:10:58,555
Wait, what about... Okay, go on.

181
00:10:59,663 --> 00:11:02,689
You devote all your time and energy
into fixing them up

182
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:04,595
instead of doing the humane thing,

183
00:11:04,702 --> 00:11:07,193
which is to have sex with them
and run away.

184
00:11:08,038 --> 00:11:10,529
Exactly how is that the humane thing?

185
00:11:10,608 --> 00:11:14,544
My way, they have a good time,
you have a good time, nobody suffers.

186
00:11:14,745 --> 00:11:18,681
Your way, you get married,
you take over their lives,

187
00:11:18,749 --> 00:11:21,616
they start to hate you,
and you end up moving in with me.

188
00:11:23,454 --> 00:11:26,014
You know what, Charlie?
I think you're jealous.

189
00:11:26,223 --> 00:11:28,555
- Of who?
- Of me.

190
00:11:28,626 --> 00:11:30,924
For the first time in our lives,
a woman picked me

191
00:11:31,028 --> 00:11:32,689
over you, and you can't deal with it.

192
00:11:32,763 --> 00:11:35,698
I can deal with it.
I don't get it, but I can deal with it.

193
00:11:37,234 --> 00:11:40,567
I feel sorry for you.
I feel sorry that your heart

194
00:11:40,638 --> 00:11:44,597
has become so hard and small
that you've lost the capacity

195
00:11:44,708 --> 00:11:48,109
to connect with another human being
on any level any more meaningful

196
00:11:48,212 --> 00:11:51,272
than the inebriated exchange
of bodily fluids.

197
00:11:54,551 --> 00:11:56,815
Boy, leave it to you
to take a beautiful thing

198
00:11:56,954 --> 00:11:59,388
like drunken sex and make it sound dirty.

199
00:12:01,592 --> 00:12:03,958
I don't know why
I even bother talking to you.

200
00:12:08,065 --> 00:12:09,896
- Alan?
- What?

201
00:12:10,267 --> 00:12:12,667
I thought we had a pact
to never go to bed mad.

202
00:12:16,473 --> 00:12:18,498
Leave me alone.

203
00:12:19,343 --> 00:12:22,471
Come on. Don't you want to spoon?

204
00:12:24,014 --> 00:12:26,744
I swear to God,
you are going to lose that hand.

205
00:12:28,919 --> 00:12:31,717
- That's not my hand.
- Mom!

206
00:12:39,396 --> 00:12:43,332
- Do you know where Jake is?
- No, honey, I'm sorry.

207
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:47,061
- We're playing hide-and-seek.
- I don't know where he's hiding.

208
00:12:47,137 --> 00:12:50,072
No, I was hiding,
and he was supposed to find me.

209
00:12:52,309 --> 00:12:53,674
It's been over an hour.

210
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:58,671
- Lf I see him, I'll let him know.
- Thank you.

211
00:12:59,083 --> 00:13:00,482
You're welcome.

212
00:13:02,753 --> 00:13:05,017
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

213
00:13:08,659 --> 00:13:09,683
Morning.

214
00:13:11,095 --> 00:13:12,119
Morning.

215
00:13:35,819 --> 00:13:38,151
- Coffee?
- Thank you.

216
00:13:39,823 --> 00:13:44,317
So, I thought maybe today, you, me,
and the kids might go do something fun.

217
00:13:44,495 --> 00:13:46,861
- What about Charlie?
- He's had his fun.

218
00:13:48,565 --> 00:13:49,998
I know. Why don't we go

219
00:13:50,067 --> 00:13:52,160
to Will Rogers State Park
and have a picnic?

220
00:13:52,236 --> 00:13:54,727
- That sounds nice.
- Great.

221
00:13:58,976 --> 00:14:00,876
- Morning.
- Morning.

222
00:14:09,553 --> 00:14:10,850
Oh, man.

223
00:14:12,189 --> 00:14:13,588
I'm the extra guy.

224
00:14:15,325 --> 00:14:17,486
Don't call yourself extra.

225
00:14:17,561 --> 00:14:19,051
- Try superfluous.
- Alan.

226
00:14:20,764 --> 00:14:24,894
- Fifth wheel, eleventh toe, third nipple.
- Alan!

227
00:14:26,537 --> 00:14:27,663
Interesting.

228
00:14:27,738 --> 00:14:30,229
- What's interesting?
- This is new for me.

229
00:14:32,009 --> 00:14:33,408
Don't really like it.

230
00:14:35,913 --> 00:14:39,212
- Charlie, you're a great guy.
- No, please, stop.

231
00:14:39,716 --> 00:14:41,445
Do not call me a great guy.

232
00:14:41,852 --> 00:14:43,945
That's what you call
the schmuck loser friend

233
00:14:44,021 --> 00:14:45,318
who has to dance with the

234
00:14:45,389 --> 00:14:47,220
hot chick's ugly cousin.

235
00:14:52,362 --> 00:14:57,061
- What?
- Nothing. Just having a really good day.

236
00:15:01,271 --> 00:15:05,765
- Hey, coming on the picnic, Uncle Charlie?
- No. Couldn't find a date.

237
00:15:06,877 --> 00:15:07,969
Jake,

238
00:15:08,045 --> 00:15:10,741
Mom wants to know
if you want egg salad or tuna for lunch.

239
00:15:10,814 --> 00:15:12,805
- Tuna.
- Me, too.

240
00:15:16,987 --> 00:15:18,750
God, she's annoying.

241
00:15:20,057 --> 00:15:21,854
At least you're not a third nipple.

242
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:24,791
Jake, why don't you go in the kitchen

243
00:15:24,895 --> 00:15:27,830
and help Joanie pick out some snacks
for the picnic basket?

244
00:15:33,837 --> 00:15:35,566
You sure you don't want to come with us?

245
00:15:35,772 --> 00:15:39,230
- Do you really want me to come with you?
- No, I was just being polite.

246
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:44,769
Listen, Frankie,
we need to talk about you and Alan.

247
00:15:45,849 --> 00:15:47,749
Come on, stud.

248
00:15:48,152 --> 00:15:51,952
- You're not jealous, are you?
- No. Dumbfounded, maybe.

249
00:15:53,090 --> 00:15:56,150
Mystified, astounded, flabbergasted,
but not jealous.

250
00:15:57,327 --> 00:16:00,592
I just want to make sure
that you understand how vulnerable he is.

251
00:16:00,664 --> 00:16:03,258
You don't think I'm vulnerable, too?

252
00:16:03,534 --> 00:16:05,126
Maybe you haven't noticed, Charlie,

253
00:16:05,202 --> 00:16:07,932
but I'm wrapped tighter
than an airport sandwich.

254
00:16:08,839 --> 00:16:12,502
Okay, let me put it this way,
my brother is crazy about you.

255
00:16:12,609 --> 00:16:14,941
Well, I'm crazy about him, too.

256
00:16:15,479 --> 00:16:18,312
No, you don't understand. Alan's a nester.

257
00:16:18,382 --> 00:16:21,351
He's already imagining
the two of you walking through IKEA,

258
00:16:21,451 --> 00:16:23,942
picking out flatware and throw pillows.

259
00:16:24,688 --> 00:16:26,918
- Come on.
- He did it with me.

260
00:16:31,795 --> 00:16:33,695
You really care about him, don't you?

261
00:16:35,699 --> 00:16:36,825
Yes.

262
00:16:37,935 --> 00:16:39,960
You're a great guy, Charlie.

263
00:16:46,843 --> 00:16:49,141
Great guy and a kiss on the cheek.

264
00:16:50,547 --> 00:16:52,811
Why doesn't she just kick me in the balls?

265
00:16:57,354 --> 00:16:58,719
- Want to play tag?
- No.

266
00:16:58,822 --> 00:17:00,153
- Hide-and-seek?
- No.

267
00:17:00,224 --> 00:17:01,657
- Want to chase me?
- No.

268
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:08,160
- The kids are having a great time.
- This is a wonderful idea, Alan. Thank you.

269
00:17:08,232 --> 00:17:10,564
Hey, what makes it wonderful
is the company.

270
00:17:11,201 --> 00:17:14,068
Do you always say exactly the right thing?

271
00:17:15,038 --> 00:17:16,130
I don't know.

272
00:17:16,206 --> 00:17:20,074
I suppose I try to be sensitive
to the moment

273
00:17:20,177 --> 00:17:23,578
and weigh my words
so that they're emotional...

274
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:24,704
No, not always.

275
00:17:31,655 --> 00:17:35,250
Listen, Frankie, I was thinking.

276
00:17:35,926 --> 00:17:39,828
We get along so well,
and our kids get along,

277
00:17:39,896 --> 00:17:42,831
and since neither one of us
really has our own place...

278
00:17:42,899 --> 00:17:43,923
Alan.

279
00:17:48,905 --> 00:17:50,236
Absolutely not.

280
00:17:52,442 --> 00:17:54,239
- But...
- No. My life is such a mess,

281
00:17:54,344 --> 00:17:56,744
and I've got to straighten out
a bunch of things

282
00:17:56,847 --> 00:17:59,042
before I can even think
about a relationship.

283
00:18:00,350 --> 00:18:05,083
Yes, you've got a lot of baggage,
but it's nothing I can't get to the curb.

284
00:18:07,791 --> 00:18:10,351
- What?
- It was something Charlie said.

285
00:18:10,427 --> 00:18:12,395
I was hoping you'd know what it meant.

286
00:18:13,697 --> 00:18:14,925
No. Alan,

287
00:18:15,565 --> 00:18:17,897
I talked to my brother in Seattle today,

288
00:18:18,035 --> 00:18:23,029
and he and his wife are going
to put me and Joanie up for a while.

289
00:18:25,442 --> 00:18:27,569
- You're leaving?
- Tomorrow morning.

290
00:18:30,147 --> 00:18:33,548
'Cause, you know, I can enroll her
in school there and get a job

291
00:18:33,884 --> 00:18:36,444
and start putting my life
back together again.

292
00:18:36,553 --> 00:18:39,317
Yeah, no. That makes sense. Sure.

293
00:18:41,391 --> 00:18:44,758
- I'm sorry.
- No. You're doing the right thing.

294
00:18:45,829 --> 00:18:49,094
- Look on the bright side, Alan.
- What bright side?

295
00:18:50,934 --> 00:18:52,765
You're going to get laid tonight.

296
00:18:59,576 --> 00:19:01,407
Oh, boy. I think I'm going to cry again.

297
00:19:07,351 --> 00:19:10,149
Okay, hon, the cab's waiting.
Say goodbye to Jake.

298
00:19:10,454 --> 00:19:12,251
- Bye, Jake.
- Bye.

299
00:19:14,424 --> 00:19:15,686
Oh, man!

300
00:19:17,994 --> 00:19:21,953
- Charlie, what can I say?
- I know. I'm a great guy.

301
00:19:26,336 --> 00:19:27,428
Oh, man!

302
00:19:29,873 --> 00:19:32,808
You know, I would've been happy
to drive you to the airport.

303
00:19:32,876 --> 00:19:37,370
No, it's better to say goodbye here,
because LAX is hectic and crazy,

304
00:19:37,514 --> 00:19:40,711
and the underwire in my bra
always sets off the metal detectors.

305
00:19:42,886 --> 00:19:45,116
You know,
this doesn't have to be goodbye forever.

306
00:19:47,576 --> 00:19:49,908
Once we get all settled,
you can come visit us.

307
00:19:51,146 --> 00:19:52,170
Sure.

308
00:20:07,829 --> 00:20:10,093
Bye.

309
00:20:30,352 --> 00:20:31,717
Here, I'm running late.

310
00:20:45,066 --> 00:20:49,025
- It's tough seeing her go, isn't it?
- Yeah. I'm really going to miss Joanie.

311
00:21:20,869 --> 00:21:22,063
English
