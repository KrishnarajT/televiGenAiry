1
00:00:01,599 --> 00:00:03,499
No, but I trust you.

2
00:00:05,436 --> 00:00:09,497
What's ironic is while they're arguing
about who gets you, I get you.

3
00:00:09,607 --> 00:00:13,008
And you know what?
It's not such a big deal.

4
00:00:14,913 --> 00:00:17,575
No offense, but let's face it, you're 10.

5
00:00:17,649 --> 00:00:20,083
I can't take you to Vegas,
we can't double-date.

6
00:00:20,151 --> 00:00:23,609
And when was the last time
you picked up a check, you mooch?

7
00:00:23,988 --> 00:00:25,751
I'm almost 11.

8
00:00:27,325 --> 00:00:28,792
Okay, I think we've got it.

9
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:31,192
I get him Thanksgiving,
you get him Halloween.

10
00:00:31,296 --> 00:00:33,696
You get him Christmas Eve,
I get him Christmas Day.

11
00:00:33,798 --> 00:00:36,358
- I get him Yom Kippur.
- And I get Hanukkah.

12
00:00:37,635 --> 00:00:40,468
Hey, guys, I just found out.

13
00:00:40,738 --> 00:00:43,002
Jake's birthday is, like, in a week.

14
00:00:45,009 --> 00:00:47,307
Shouldn't we make plans?

15
00:00:48,246 --> 00:00:50,339
You're right, he's a schmuck.

16
00:00:50,448 --> 00:00:51,642
What?

17
00:00:51,749 --> 00:00:54,309
We know when his birthday is, Charlie.
We were there.

18
00:00:54,419 --> 00:00:57,616
But only one of us got a needle
shoved in their spine.

19
00:00:57,689 --> 00:00:59,657
You begged for that.

20
00:01:00,758 --> 00:01:04,250
Anyway, you, me, and Mom are taking
Jake to a show at the Magic Castle.

21
00:01:04,329 --> 00:01:05,353
You invited Mom?

22
00:01:05,463 --> 00:01:08,626
You want to tell her she can't come
to her grandchild's birthday?

23
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:10,793
'Cause believe me, I tried.

24
00:01:11,135 --> 00:01:12,466
Oh, man.

25
00:01:12,537 --> 00:01:13,936
Look at the bright side.

26
00:01:14,005 --> 00:01:17,202
Maybe we can bribe one of the
magicians to get her sawed in half.

27
00:01:17,308 --> 00:01:19,970
Or better still, thrown in a wood chipper.

28
00:01:21,112 --> 00:01:24,878
Judith and her sister
are going to join us as well.

29
00:01:25,383 --> 00:01:27,476
Which sister, the brunette or the blonde?

30
00:01:27,552 --> 00:01:29,452
The brunette. Why?

31
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:32,318
Just curious. I never slept with the blonde.

32
00:01:32,891 --> 00:01:35,724
And you're not gonna sleep
with the brunette again, either.

33
00:01:35,827 --> 00:01:37,692
Relax, that was 12 years ago.

34
00:01:37,795 --> 00:01:38,989
Well, thank you.

35
00:01:39,063 --> 00:01:41,793
Let's just wait
till we get a look at her now.

36
00:01:54,084 --> 00:01:55,574
Happy birthday!

37
00:01:55,686 --> 00:01:57,881
A magic set? Awesome.

38
00:01:57,988 --> 00:02:01,151
How lovely.
Perhaps he'll grow up to be a carny.

39
00:02:03,861 --> 00:02:08,491
It includes 14 different illusions
that will amaze and astound your friends.

40
00:02:08,566 --> 00:02:11,694
But, of course, your friends
may be smarter than mine.

41
00:02:12,002 --> 00:02:14,664
- Cool!
- Have fun at the Magic Castle.

42
00:02:14,738 --> 00:02:16,296
Aren't you coming with us?

43
00:02:16,373 --> 00:02:19,536
I wish I could, but I gotta go
to some clown's wedding.

44
00:02:19,643 --> 00:02:21,406
I'll try and come back for cake, okay?

45
00:02:21,512 --> 00:02:23,980
- Thanks a lot, Rose.
- You're welcome. Bye, Evelyn.

46
00:02:24,048 --> 00:02:26,346
Bye-bye. Thank you so much.

47
00:02:26,984 --> 00:02:28,315
Poor soul.

48
00:02:28,719 --> 00:02:30,914
I'm sure she meant well.

49
00:02:31,589 --> 00:02:32,851
Now.

50
00:02:32,923 --> 00:02:35,084
Open Grandmommy's present.

51
00:02:37,695 --> 00:02:39,993
- Clothes?
- Happy birthday.

52
00:02:40,064 --> 00:02:42,191
Thanks a lot, but clothes?

53
00:02:42,866 --> 00:02:45,198
Not clothes, darling.

54
00:02:45,269 --> 00:02:47,169
It's Calvin Klein.

55
00:02:48,872 --> 00:02:50,567
No, it's clothes.

56
00:02:51,208 --> 00:02:54,575
Believe me, sweetheart,
the girls are gonna love you in this.

57
00:02:54,678 --> 00:02:56,373
What girls?

58
00:02:56,447 --> 00:02:59,610
All right, the other boys will be envious.

59
00:02:59,717 --> 00:03:02,413
The other boys will beat me up.

60
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:05,682
Well, there's just no pleasing you,
is there?

61
00:03:09,026 --> 00:03:11,221
Almost ready?
Judith and Liz will be here soon.

62
00:03:11,295 --> 00:03:12,956
Liz. Thank you.

63
00:03:15,899 --> 00:03:18,197
Boy, that would have been embarrassing.

64
00:03:18,268 --> 00:03:20,759
Charlie, please don't make
a bad situation worse.

65
00:03:20,871 --> 00:03:23,533
Judith and Liz have been
at each other's throats for years.

66
00:03:23,607 --> 00:03:24,733
- Why's that?
- I don't know.

67
00:03:24,808 --> 00:03:27,606
Maybe it's because Liz
was always more popular.

68
00:03:27,711 --> 00:03:29,611
Maybe because Judith was smarter.

69
00:03:29,713 --> 00:03:32,477
Maybe, and this is just a theory
on my part,

70
00:03:32,583 --> 00:03:34,642
it had something to do with the fact that

71
00:03:34,752 --> 00:03:38,244
Liz did my brother in the coatroom
at our wedding reception.

72
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:41,820
Well, no secret why she was popular.

73
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:48,662
At our wedding reception, Charlie.

74
00:03:49,266 --> 00:03:50,733
In the coatroom.

75
00:03:50,801 --> 00:03:52,792
You were louder than the band.

76
00:03:55,205 --> 00:03:57,366
Hey, you make it sound so sleazy.

77
00:03:58,142 --> 00:04:00,542
I'm sorry. Class it up for me.

78
00:04:02,079 --> 00:04:04,570
Okay, to begin with,
we were on a mink coat.

79
00:04:04,648 --> 00:04:05,910
Goodbye.

80
00:04:08,819 --> 00:04:10,787
And I was wearing a tuxedo.

81
00:04:11,989 --> 00:04:14,150
It's an 11-year-old's birthday party.

82
00:04:14,258 --> 00:04:16,453
You could've at least put on a bra.

83
00:04:17,661 --> 00:04:19,925
Some of us don't need bras.

84
00:04:21,131 --> 00:04:23,565
Some of us have had husbands
and children.

85
00:04:23,634 --> 00:04:25,397
I've had husbands.

86
00:04:28,472 --> 00:04:30,963
And please, would you behave yourself
with Charlie?

87
00:04:31,075 --> 00:04:32,303
- What do you mean?
- I mean,

88
00:04:32,409 --> 00:04:36,903
I don't want a repeat of what happened
in the coatroom at my wedding reception.

89
00:04:37,481 --> 00:04:39,108
That was Charlie?

90
00:04:41,452 --> 00:04:43,920
Hey, soul sisters. Come on in.

91
00:04:44,188 --> 00:04:45,314
Hello, Alan.

92
00:04:45,422 --> 00:04:47,515
Alan, you look fantastic.

93
00:04:47,624 --> 00:04:50,115
I guess single life really agrees with you.

94
00:04:50,194 --> 00:04:51,786
You know,

95
00:04:51,862 --> 00:04:53,022
doing okay.

96
00:04:53,130 --> 00:04:55,496
Starting over, landed on my feet.

97
00:04:55,599 --> 00:04:56,964
Like a cat.

98
00:04:58,001 --> 00:04:59,195
Hey, Mom.

99
00:04:59,303 --> 00:05:01,498
Hey, sweetie. Hi.

100
00:05:01,605 --> 00:05:04,130
- Hey, Aunt Liz.
- There's my favorite nephew.

101
00:05:04,208 --> 00:05:06,176
Happy birthday, sweetie.

102
00:05:06,276 --> 00:05:08,141
It isn't clothes, is it?

103
00:05:09,446 --> 00:05:11,311
This is a surprise.

104
00:05:11,381 --> 00:05:12,541
Hello, Evelyn.

105
00:05:12,649 --> 00:05:15,117
It's not a surprise. I told her.

106
00:05:15,886 --> 00:05:19,822
You're looking very well.
Slimming down nicely.

107
00:05:20,824 --> 00:05:23,952
Thanks. I recently dropped 160 pounds.

108
00:05:27,397 --> 00:05:28,659
152.

109
00:05:31,301 --> 00:05:32,996
I take Pilates.

110
00:05:37,708 --> 00:05:38,834
Hey, everybody.

111
00:05:38,942 --> 00:05:41,206
Uncle Charlie, look what Aunt Liz got me.

112
00:05:41,311 --> 00:05:42,608
Awesome.

113
00:05:43,013 --> 00:05:45,607
I don't suppose you thought to buy him
a safety helmet.

114
00:05:45,682 --> 00:05:49,174
You ride with Aunt Liz,
you take your chances. Right, Liz?

115
00:05:53,824 --> 00:05:55,655
This guy? Are you sure?

116
00:06:01,198 --> 00:06:03,029
- Alan?
- Yeah, Mom.

117
00:06:03,133 --> 00:06:06,364
Now that we've seen the dove disappear
up the greasy man's sleeve,

118
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:09,064
how about we stop for a little drinkie-poo?

119
00:06:09,506 --> 00:06:13,169
Mom, it's still Jake's birthday.
We're going home for cake.

120
00:06:13,243 --> 00:06:14,676
Okay.

121
00:06:14,745 --> 00:06:16,713
But first a drinkie-poo.

122
00:06:17,581 --> 00:06:20,482
Don't you think you had enough
to drink at the magic show?

123
00:06:20,551 --> 00:06:23,679
Excuse me, but some of us
deal with our boredom and depression

124
00:06:23,754 --> 00:06:26,587
the old-fashioned, non-prescription way.

125
00:06:28,659 --> 00:06:31,423
- That's telling her, Evelyn.
- Now, see.

126
00:06:31,528 --> 00:06:34,895
This one gets me.
Alan, you married the wrong sister.

127
00:06:36,033 --> 00:06:38,866
Why don't you lie down back there,
take a little nap?

128
00:06:38,936 --> 00:06:40,369
Okey-dokey.

129
00:06:45,676 --> 00:06:47,837
How can you not remember the coatroom?

130
00:06:47,911 --> 00:06:49,742
I remember the coatroom.

131
00:06:49,847 --> 00:06:52,042
I just don't remember you.

132
00:06:52,115 --> 00:06:54,049
How can you not remember me?

133
00:06:54,117 --> 00:06:56,847
Do you remember everyone
you've had sex with?

134
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,114
Of course not.

135
00:06:58,222 --> 00:07:00,622
But come on, we're practically family.

136
00:07:02,359 --> 00:07:04,725
Okay, Dad, see this ring?

137
00:07:04,795 --> 00:07:07,229
It's made of one unbroken piece
of stainless steel.

138
00:07:07,331 --> 00:07:08,764
I can see that.

139
00:07:08,866 --> 00:07:11,391
And this one is just the same. I swear.

140
00:07:12,202 --> 00:07:14,670
- I believe you.
- Now watch.

141
00:07:14,738 --> 00:07:16,831
One, two, three.

142
00:07:18,041 --> 00:07:19,338
Hold on.

143
00:07:20,244 --> 00:07:22,212
One, two, three.

144
00:07:23,614 --> 00:07:24,740
Ironic.

145
00:07:27,284 --> 00:07:29,013
Wait, don't look.

146
00:07:29,519 --> 00:07:32,420
Alan, how are those
magic fingers of yours?

147
00:07:32,522 --> 00:07:33,682
I'm sorry?

148
00:07:33,757 --> 00:07:36,954
I have this kink in my back
and I was hoping you could give me

149
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:40,052
one of your fantastic adjustments
when we get home.

150
00:07:42,266 --> 00:07:43,563
Sure, I suppose.

151
00:07:43,634 --> 00:07:46,262
Thank you. I can't wait.

152
00:07:47,638 --> 00:07:50,766
Wait a minute.
His magic fingers you remember?

153
00:07:50,874 --> 00:07:52,205
Ta-da!

154
00:07:57,707 --> 00:07:59,140
This is really weird.

155
00:07:59,209 --> 00:08:02,110
Yeah. How could she not remember me?

156
00:08:04,481 --> 00:08:07,177
- What are you talking about?
- What are you talking about?

157
00:08:07,284 --> 00:08:09,514
Judith's sister's hitting on me.

158
00:08:09,619 --> 00:08:12,952
She's not hitting on you.
She's hitting on her sister's ex-husband.

159
00:08:13,023 --> 00:08:14,547
But that's me.

160
00:08:15,125 --> 00:08:16,990
Stop taking it personally.

161
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:20,154
You said it yourself. They've been going
at each other for years.

162
00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:22,698
And let's examine the current situation.

163
00:08:22,799 --> 00:08:26,462
Nothing Liz does with me
is gonna make Judith any madder.

164
00:08:26,536 --> 00:08:28,527
I've already flown my mission.

165
00:08:31,074 --> 00:08:33,907
The only play she has left
is to sleep with you.

166
00:08:34,010 --> 00:08:36,171
Well, that's not gonna happen.

167
00:08:36,246 --> 00:08:38,680
Well, certainly not with that attitude.

168
00:08:40,917 --> 00:08:43,784
Now, come on, you can't say
you've never thought about it.

169
00:08:43,853 --> 00:08:45,184
Liz? No.

170
00:08:45,655 --> 00:08:47,122
Alan.

171
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:48,885
Look me in the eye.

172
00:08:49,559 --> 00:08:51,652
Okay, I'm looking.

173
00:08:51,995 --> 00:08:54,896
Tell me you've never thought
about being with Liz.

174
00:08:55,165 --> 00:08:57,827
You know, you have very curly eyelashes.

175
00:08:59,302 --> 00:09:01,896
- Answer the question.
- Come on, Charlie.

176
00:09:02,005 --> 00:09:04,064
- It's my ex-wife's sister.
- Exactly.

177
00:09:04,174 --> 00:09:07,507
Sisters are like
the Holy Grail of recreational sex.

178
00:09:09,179 --> 00:09:12,410
Technically, it'd be twins,
but that's such a biological oddity,

179
00:09:12,515 --> 00:09:14,346
it's hardly worth pursuing.

180
00:09:15,151 --> 00:09:16,675
Dad, pick a card.

181
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,480
Okay.

182
00:09:19,889 --> 00:09:21,254
Seven of diamonds?

183
00:09:21,358 --> 00:09:22,416
No.

184
00:09:24,394 --> 00:09:25,884
Eight of spades?

185
00:09:25,995 --> 00:09:27,053
No.

186
00:09:27,997 --> 00:09:30,056
- Ace of clubs?
- No.

187
00:09:31,101 --> 00:09:32,693
Is it black or red?

188
00:09:38,675 --> 00:09:41,007
We'll just have the cake, and then we'll go.

189
00:09:41,077 --> 00:09:42,237
You can go if you want.

190
00:09:42,345 --> 00:09:45,178
I'll have Alan drive me home
after he adjusts me.

191
00:09:45,548 --> 00:09:47,015
Why are you doing this?

192
00:09:47,083 --> 00:09:48,209
Doing what?

193
00:09:48,284 --> 00:09:49,444
Alan.

194
00:09:50,086 --> 00:09:52,919
- You want him back, don't you?
- No, I don't want him back.

195
00:09:53,022 --> 00:09:55,786
Then why do you care what I do with him?

196
00:09:55,892 --> 00:09:58,520
If you're determined to do
something stupid today,

197
00:09:58,595 --> 00:10:00,927
I'd actually prefer you do Charlie.

198
00:10:02,098 --> 00:10:05,261
So would Charlie,
but we can't always get what we want.

199
00:10:06,436 --> 00:10:09,633
Wow! That's a lot of candles.

200
00:10:09,739 --> 00:10:11,036
He's still 11, right?

201
00:10:11,107 --> 00:10:13,735
You want to deal with the candles?
Is that what you want?

202
00:10:13,810 --> 00:10:15,937
- No, I'm fine.
- So, Alan.

203
00:10:16,045 --> 00:10:18,570
When do you think you'll be ready for me?

204
00:10:18,915 --> 00:10:20,382
Maybe after the cake.

205
00:10:20,450 --> 00:10:21,576
- Okay.
- Okay.

206
00:10:21,651 --> 00:10:24,085
You just say the word, and we'll do it.

207
00:10:25,989 --> 00:10:28,287
In high school, the word was "hello. "

208
00:10:29,659 --> 00:10:31,923
Don't pretend you don't know
what she's doing.

209
00:10:31,995 --> 00:10:34,293
Her back hurts, Judith.
She wants an adjustment.

210
00:10:34,397 --> 00:10:35,989
She doesn't want an adjustment.

211
00:10:36,099 --> 00:10:39,000
And why do you think her back hurts
in the first place?

212
00:10:39,102 --> 00:10:40,626
So, she does need an adjustment.

213
00:10:40,737 --> 00:10:43,171
I forbid you to have anything
to do with my sister.

214
00:10:43,273 --> 00:10:45,241
Really? You forbid me?
I've got news for you.

215
00:10:45,308 --> 00:10:47,742
We're not married anymore.
You don't get to forbid me.

216
00:10:47,811 --> 00:10:49,506
- I'm warning you.
- What warning?

217
00:10:49,612 --> 00:10:51,807
- What happened to forbidding?
- Just listen to me.

218
00:10:51,915 --> 00:10:54,145
If you lay one magic little finger on Liz,

219
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:57,686
- you and I will have a big problem.
- What are you gonna do? Divorce me?

220
00:10:57,787 --> 00:10:59,414
Marry me again and then divorce me?

221
00:10:59,489 --> 00:11:00,683
You want to see a trick?

222
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:03,258
- Sure.
- Yeah, sure, honey.

223
00:11:03,326 --> 00:11:05,760
"Good evening, sir or madame.

224
00:11:06,196 --> 00:11:07,993
"Have we ever met before?"

225
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:12,261
So, Liz.

226
00:11:12,335 --> 00:11:15,270
The wedding reception, the coatroom.

227
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:17,602
Did I ever say thank you?

228
00:11:18,842 --> 00:11:21,003
I don't really remember, Charlie.

229
00:11:21,945 --> 00:11:25,176
Well, let me just say, long overdue then,

230
00:11:25,281 --> 00:11:26,646
thank you.

231
00:11:28,885 --> 00:11:30,045
Okay.

232
00:11:31,554 --> 00:11:33,852
And not just for the one time.

233
00:11:33,957 --> 00:11:37,893
Over the years, I've actually used
the mental picture of that night as

234
00:11:37,994 --> 00:11:40,053
lighter fluid when I'm,

235
00:11:41,831 --> 00:11:44,322
you know, barbecuing alone.

236
00:11:47,303 --> 00:11:49,464
Hey, come on, that's a compliment.

237
00:11:53,676 --> 00:11:55,507
- Hey, Grandma?
- What?

238
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:00,410
Now, madame,
keep your eye on the magic ball.

239
00:12:00,517 --> 00:12:02,109
Watch closely.

240
00:12:02,218 --> 00:12:03,879
No, wait.

241
00:12:04,554 --> 00:12:09,048
Okay, now I'll take the magic ball
from my left hand and put it into my right.

242
00:12:10,126 --> 00:12:13,721
See? Now I'll throw the magic ball
back into the cup.

243
00:12:15,098 --> 00:12:17,066
You think it's under the cup?

244
00:12:17,634 --> 00:12:19,625
Do I think what's under the cup?

245
00:12:19,736 --> 00:12:21,294
The magic ball.

246
00:12:21,704 --> 00:12:24,366
Very good, dear.

247
00:12:38,321 --> 00:12:40,915
Good Lord, how long have I been asleep?

248
00:12:41,591 --> 00:12:43,115
Make a wish, buddy.

249
00:12:48,131 --> 00:12:49,928
I've already made my wish.

250
00:12:49,999 --> 00:12:52,593
- Don't you dare.
- Now we're daring?

251
00:12:52,669 --> 00:12:54,796
Warning, forbidding, and daring?

252
00:12:54,904 --> 00:12:56,667
I want to talk to you.

253
00:12:56,773 --> 00:12:59,071
- Are you hearing this?
- I'm trying.

254
00:13:01,177 --> 00:13:03,645
- What is your problem?
- You are my problem.

255
00:13:03,746 --> 00:13:06,943
- Why are they fighting?
- They're not fighting. They're discussing.

256
00:13:07,016 --> 00:13:10,008
I'm a child of divorce, Dad.
I know the difference.

257
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:13,821
- You're a selfish, hateful person.
- Maybe you should go to your room.

258
00:13:13,923 --> 00:13:16,255
- It's my birthday.
- Ironic, huh?

259
00:13:17,927 --> 00:13:19,360
Hi, everybody.

260
00:13:20,964 --> 00:13:21,988
Sorry I'm late.

261
00:13:22,098 --> 00:13:25,431
Actually, you're right on time.
Here's $50. Take Jake to the arcade,

262
00:13:25,501 --> 00:13:27,594
and don't come back
till you're out of quarters.

263
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:29,695
Okay. Come on, Jake.

264
00:13:29,806 --> 00:13:31,865
Cool. So, how was the wedding?

265
00:13:31,975 --> 00:13:33,499
It was a circus.

266
00:13:34,043 --> 00:13:36,170
Bye, honey. Have fun.

267
00:13:36,279 --> 00:13:39,271
You were always a cheap slut
and you haven't changed.

268
00:13:39,349 --> 00:13:42,785
I was the slut?
Miss Technically-I'm-Still-A-Virgin.

269
00:13:43,119 --> 00:13:45,053
Girls, that's no way to talk.

270
00:13:50,493 --> 00:13:54,293
Ever since we were kids, anytime I loved
something, you took it away from me.

271
00:13:54,364 --> 00:13:56,457
But you will not take away
my ex-husband.

272
00:13:56,532 --> 00:13:58,295
- You love me?
- What? No!

273
00:13:58,368 --> 00:14:00,461
I'm trying to make a point here.

274
00:14:00,637 --> 00:14:03,697
Judith, if I wanted Alan,
I could've had him a long time ago.

275
00:14:03,806 --> 00:14:05,330
What the hell does that mean?

276
00:14:05,408 --> 00:14:07,569
- You never told her?
- Told me what?

277
00:14:09,078 --> 00:14:11,842
Well, I mean, it's no big deal.

278
00:14:11,914 --> 00:14:13,245
Really.

279
00:14:13,683 --> 00:14:15,344
It's just that

280
00:14:15,418 --> 00:14:17,716
before I asked you out,

281
00:14:18,054 --> 00:14:20,420
I asked Liz out.

282
00:14:23,593 --> 00:14:25,185
You lied to me?

283
00:14:26,996 --> 00:14:30,193
If I had said yes,
you never would have dated him.

284
00:14:30,266 --> 00:14:32,234
So, I was your second choice?

285
00:14:32,335 --> 00:14:33,927
No.

286
00:14:35,571 --> 00:14:37,163
Chronologically, yes.

287
00:14:38,007 --> 00:14:40,532
But in my heart, you were always first.

288
00:14:40,610 --> 00:14:42,703
But in reality, you were second.

289
00:14:44,113 --> 00:14:45,944
And you never told me this?

290
00:14:46,382 --> 00:14:48,373
Well, you can kind of see why.

291
00:14:49,786 --> 00:14:51,549
You know, this

292
00:14:51,621 --> 00:14:54,522
wouldn't have happened if you were twins.

293
00:14:55,792 --> 00:14:57,453
Okay. Fine.

294
00:14:57,560 --> 00:15:01,018
You always wanted Liz?
Go ahead, here's your chance.

295
00:15:01,097 --> 00:15:02,928
Give her your little adjustment.

296
00:15:03,032 --> 00:15:05,262
While you're having
a good time with my sister,

297
00:15:05,368 --> 00:15:07,859
I'll have a good time with your brother.

298
00:15:08,471 --> 00:15:09,802
Beg pardon?

299
00:15:10,807 --> 00:15:14,573
Don't be coy with me. You know we've
always had sexual tension between us.

300
00:15:14,644 --> 00:15:17,636
Really? I thought it was
just regular tension.

301
00:15:18,247 --> 00:15:20,408
Come on, I've seen you looking
at my chest.

302
00:15:20,483 --> 00:15:22,474
You looked at my wife's chest?

303
00:15:22,885 --> 00:15:24,443
Hey, I'm a guy.

304
00:15:24,821 --> 00:15:27,312
I will rock his world, Alan, I swear.

305
00:15:27,423 --> 00:15:29,618
- You're bluffing.
- Am I? Watch me.

306
00:15:29,726 --> 00:15:31,421
- Come on, Charlie.
- Alan?

307
00:15:31,494 --> 00:15:33,553
- She's bluffing, Charlie.
- Are you sure?

308
00:15:33,629 --> 00:15:35,256
Trust me, she hates you.

309
00:15:35,331 --> 00:15:37,822
Trust me. That doesn't always stop them.

310
00:15:38,167 --> 00:15:40,795
Come on, Alan,
I'll show you where it hurts.

311
00:15:41,471 --> 00:15:42,961
Clear something up for me.

312
00:15:43,072 --> 00:15:45,404
Chiropractic adjustment,
that's just a euphemism?

313
00:15:45,475 --> 00:15:47,909
- Right.
- So, we're really gonna do this?

314
00:15:48,778 --> 00:15:50,837
Wow, I thought we were bluffing.

315
00:16:02,992 --> 00:16:05,153
- Okay, we were bluffing.
- Us, too.

316
00:17:16,866 --> 00:17:19,664
My God, that clown has no legs!

317
00:17:25,608 --> 00:17:27,667
Okay, you see the coin?

318
00:17:27,777 --> 00:17:30,678
You're supposed to say,
"Have we ever met before?"

319
00:17:33,282 --> 00:17:36,615
Just watch the trick, okay?
We'll work on the patter later.

320
00:17:37,086 --> 00:17:38,678
You see the coin?

321
00:17:38,788 --> 00:17:41,120
Now, I grab it with this hand

322
00:17:41,524 --> 00:17:43,014
and I blow,

323
00:17:43,926 --> 00:17:45,154
and it's gone.

324
00:17:45,928 --> 00:17:47,657
Where do you think it is?

325
00:17:48,598 --> 00:17:49,997
It's right here.

326
00:18:00,042 --> 00:18:02,101
How the hell did you do that?

327
00:18:02,979 --> 00:18:04,446
Ironic, huh?

328
00:18:33,976 --> 00:18:35,170
English
