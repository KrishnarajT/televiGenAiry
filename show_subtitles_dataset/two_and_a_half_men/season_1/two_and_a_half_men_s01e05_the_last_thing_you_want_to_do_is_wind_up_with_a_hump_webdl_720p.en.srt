1
00:00:13,961 --> 00:00:16,425
Never mix tequila and scotch.

2
00:00:16,426 --> 00:00:18,825
Morning, Uncle Charlie.

3
00:00:19,308 --> 00:00:20,716
Jake, buddy.

4
00:00:20,717 --> 00:00:23,149
Dad said you'd never get
up to go to soccer with me.

5
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:26,778
But I said, he promised. So he was wrong.

6
00:00:32,948 --> 00:00:35,347
What?

7
00:00:36,279 --> 00:00:39,575
You know, most of the parents wear
shorts and lots of sunscreen,

8
00:00:39,576 --> 00:00:42,169
but that's another way to go.

9
00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:45,595
Alan, I can't go to a soccer game.
I just got home from Vegas.

10
00:00:45,596 --> 00:00:49,300
You went out last night to return a video.

11
00:00:49,438 --> 00:00:52,927
I ran into a friend of mine who was
getting married at the Bellagio.

12
00:00:52,928 --> 00:00:55,327
That explains the tuxedo.

13
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:03,142
No, I think this was
for something else entirely.

14
00:01:03,142 --> 00:01:06,056
I'm sure I'll read about it in the paper.

15
00:01:06,057 --> 00:01:09,770
I am the Soccer Snack Buddy this week,
so I've gotta stop at the grocery store.

16
00:01:09,771 --> 00:01:12,812
Why don't you ride to the game
with Jake when the van gets here?

17
00:01:12,813 --> 00:01:14,220
I got a better idea.

18
00:01:14,221 --> 00:01:17,710
Why don't I go upstairs, throw up
and sleep in my clothes for 12 hours?

19
00:01:17,711 --> 00:01:20,336
Fine, but if you're not gonna come,

20
00:01:20,337 --> 00:01:25,116
- you gotta tell Jake yourself.
- Fine. He'll understand.

21
00:01:26,388 --> 00:01:28,787
- Jake?
- I got new cleats.

22
00:01:31,064 --> 00:01:34,361
Nice. Listen, Jake, buddy.

23
00:01:37,148 --> 00:01:39,633
Have you ever been to Vegas?

24
00:01:43,615 --> 00:01:46,840
So you're the infamous Uncle Charlie.

25
00:01:46,881 --> 00:01:49,280
I've heard about you.

26
00:01:57,730 --> 00:02:01,152
Everybody out. Watch your heads.
One at a time.

27
00:02:01,153 --> 00:02:03,550
- Party time.
- Come on.

28
00:02:08,865 --> 00:02:11,518
Here's the deal, Uncle Charlie.
I find you attractive.

29
00:02:11,519 --> 00:02:13,662
I have three kids,
a bastard of an ex-husband,

30
00:02:13,663 --> 00:02:15,741
I work 50 hours a week
at my own travel agency,

31
00:02:15,742 --> 00:02:17,213
I'm at the peak of my sexuality,

32
00:02:17,214 --> 00:02:21,821
I have a three-hour window Wednesdays
when the kids are at tae kwon do.

33
00:02:21,822 --> 00:02:23,484
You in or out?

34
00:02:23,485 --> 00:02:28,795
I'm sorry, I'm terminally hung over
and I just took a cleat in the groin.

35
00:02:28,796 --> 00:02:31,959
E-mail me. Allaboardgloria @aol.com.

36
00:02:40,858 --> 00:02:43,001
So, which one's yours?

37
00:02:43,002 --> 00:02:45,398
Please don't make me talk.

38
00:02:46,425 --> 00:02:50,462
This is Charlie Harper.
Alan Harper's brother.

39
00:02:53,751 --> 00:02:56,312
- So, who's winning?
- No one.

40
00:02:56,343 --> 00:03:00,533
We don't keep score. We think
it's healthier if the kids just play for fun.

41
00:03:00,534 --> 00:03:02,932
You're yanking me, right?

42
00:03:03,861 --> 00:03:06,548
Judith warned us that you were a pistol.

43
00:03:06,549 --> 00:03:09,332
By the way, we were so sorry
to hear about her and Alan.

44
00:03:09,333 --> 00:03:10,643
So tell us, is it true?

45
00:03:10,644 --> 00:03:13,330
Did Judith leave your
brother for another woman?

46
00:03:13,331 --> 00:03:18,020
- Why don't you ask Judith?
- We wouldn't want to pry.

47
00:03:19,730 --> 00:03:21,554
Ladies, if you'll excuse me,

48
00:03:21,555 --> 00:03:26,090
I have to go because,
hell, I don't need a reason.

49
00:03:27,793 --> 00:03:29,776
Someone's a little full of himself.

50
00:03:29,777 --> 00:03:33,328
Forget him. His brother's
the one who's in play.

51
00:03:33,329 --> 00:03:34,511
How's Jake doing?

52
00:03:34,511 --> 00:03:38,414
Jake's fine. He's 10.
He's got his whole life ahead of him.

53
00:03:38,415 --> 00:03:39,822
Me, on the other hand,

54
00:03:39,823 --> 00:03:44,300
I'm sitting in the hot sun,
in rented pants listening to myself blink.

55
00:03:44,301 --> 00:03:46,699
I'll ask somebody else.

56
00:03:51,148 --> 00:03:52,620
What?

57
00:03:52,621 --> 00:03:57,569
Sorry. I couldn't help
overhearing, and you just look so

58
00:03:57,580 --> 00:03:58,891
pathetic.

59
00:03:58,892 --> 00:04:03,177
Really? The guy at the
tux shop said I looked dashing.

60
00:04:03,178 --> 00:04:04,905
Of course, that was yesterday.

61
00:04:04,906 --> 00:04:07,784
And I found his phone
number in my pocket.

62
00:04:07,785 --> 00:04:11,368
- What was the occasion?
- Just returning a video.

63
00:04:11,369 --> 00:04:14,294
- Charlie Harper.
- Kate McLaughlin.

64
00:04:14,504 --> 00:04:16,776
Let me ask you something,
Kate McLaughlin.

65
00:04:16,777 --> 00:04:20,166
What's your take on this
whole no-keeping-score thing?

66
00:04:20,167 --> 00:04:24,261
I think it's the dumbest
thing I've ever heard.

67
00:04:24,262 --> 00:04:27,205
Can I stay here next
to you where it's safe?

68
00:04:27,206 --> 00:04:29,603
Sure.

69
00:04:29,894 --> 00:04:32,164
So, which one's yours?

70
00:04:32,165 --> 00:04:35,358
Number nine. But I'm not the father.

71
00:04:35,557 --> 00:04:37,954
Aren't you a good sport?

72
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:42,594
Jake, for the last time,

73
00:04:42,595 --> 00:04:45,473
nobody got "creamed."
No one won, no one lost.

74
00:04:45,474 --> 00:04:47,871
Yeah. Except for us. 12-2.

75
00:04:49,473 --> 00:04:54,592
It doesn't matter if you win or lose.
It's whether or not you beat the spread.

76
00:04:54,593 --> 00:04:58,399
Thank you, Charlie.
Jake, go take a shower.

77
00:04:58,848 --> 00:05:02,014
Charlie, we are trying to teach
the kids not to keep score.

78
00:05:02,015 --> 00:05:06,078
You should've thought of that
before you taught them to count.

79
00:05:06,079 --> 00:05:09,117
By the way, what are you doing
with Jake tomorrow?

80
00:05:09,118 --> 00:05:10,428
I don't know. Why?

81
00:05:10,429 --> 00:05:13,916
I made a play date for him with
one of the kids from the game.

82
00:05:13,917 --> 00:05:16,795
You're hitting on the mother, aren't you?

83
00:05:16,796 --> 00:05:19,035
Can't slip one past you, can l?

84
00:05:19,036 --> 00:05:21,595
That's not what a play date is for.

85
00:05:21,596 --> 00:05:25,594
What? The kid plays,
I have a date. Everybody wins.

86
00:05:25,595 --> 00:05:27,674
- Everybody wins?
- Yes.

87
00:05:27,675 --> 00:05:30,041
But I promise not to keep score.

88
00:05:30,042 --> 00:05:33,144
Charlie, you cannot use my son
to pick up single mothers.

89
00:05:33,145 --> 00:05:35,543
But I can.

90
00:05:35,833 --> 00:05:38,231
Good night, Snack Buddy.

91
00:05:38,393 --> 00:05:41,240
No going in the water,
no throwing rocks, and remember,

92
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:43,511
if you can't see us, we can't see you.

93
00:05:43,512 --> 00:05:45,622
Is there anything you'd
like to add, Charlie?

94
00:05:45,623 --> 00:05:48,615
- Why can't they throw rocks?
- Go.

95
00:05:49,911 --> 00:05:52,661
Ernie loves the beach.
Thanks for inviting him.

96
00:05:52,662 --> 00:05:56,315
Anything for the kids. They're our future.

97
00:05:56,885 --> 00:05:59,060
- So, where's Alan?
- I sent him to the movies.

98
00:05:59,061 --> 00:06:02,419
He deserves a break, and I get
some quality uncle time with Jake.

99
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:04,498
I think that is really nice of you.

100
00:06:04,499 --> 00:06:07,218
Ernie, keep your socks with your shoes.

101
00:06:07,219 --> 00:06:08,498
I'm sorry, where was l?

102
00:06:08,499 --> 00:06:11,346
You were saying
I was nice about something.

103
00:06:11,347 --> 00:06:13,905
How long have you lived
in Sherman Oaks?

104
00:06:13,905 --> 00:06:17,232
We moved in and...
Ernie, put that down, it's dead.

105
00:06:17,233 --> 00:06:20,143
That kid'll pick up anything,
no matter what it looks like.

106
00:06:20,144 --> 00:06:22,541
Been there.

107
00:06:22,864 --> 00:06:25,231
We moved in just in time
for the earthquake...

108
00:06:25,232 --> 00:06:27,759
Ernie, I am not gonna say it again.

109
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:30,181
Put the dead thing down.

110
00:06:31,118 --> 00:06:35,949
Jake, you should probably
put your dead thing down, too.

111
00:06:35,950 --> 00:06:38,188
- Kids.
- I know. They're just...

112
00:06:38,189 --> 00:06:40,972
Ernie, put it down
or we're leaving right now.

113
00:06:40,972 --> 00:06:44,649
I'm counting to three. One, two...

114
00:06:44,747 --> 00:06:47,626
Ernie, for God's sake,
you're killing me here.

115
00:06:47,627 --> 00:06:50,024
- Thank you.
- No problem.

116
00:06:50,091 --> 00:06:52,010
- So, did you grow up in L.A.?
- No.

117
00:06:52,011 --> 00:06:54,569
My dad was in the Army
so we moved around...

118
00:06:54,570 --> 00:06:56,393
Hell, that thing's not dead.

119
00:06:56,394 --> 00:06:59,496
I'd like to get to know you,
it's not gonna happen on a play date.

120
00:06:59,497 --> 00:07:01,704
- Ask me out sometime?
- That's a really good...

121
00:07:01,705 --> 00:07:05,415
Are you happy?
I told you to put it down, Ernie.

122
00:07:05,416 --> 00:07:08,742
Get the sand off of it. No. Don't touch it.

123
00:07:08,743 --> 00:07:13,538
- What night's good for you?
- Jake, you're not helping.

124
00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:21,772
- Don't wait up.
- Back to Vegas?

125
00:07:21,845 --> 00:07:24,246
Even better. Sherman Oaks.

126
00:07:25,690 --> 00:07:28,091
The gateway to Van Nuys.

127
00:07:29,472 --> 00:07:30,656
Kate again?

128
00:07:30,657 --> 00:07:33,123
You have no clue
what you're getting involved in

129
00:07:33,124 --> 00:07:35,270
- with these divorced soccer moms.
- You're right.

130
00:07:35,271 --> 00:07:39,115
I don't have a clue. I've never had a clue.
It's part of my charm.

131
00:07:39,116 --> 00:07:42,160
At least keep in mind that all
these women talk to each other.

132
00:07:42,161 --> 00:07:44,371
So anything you do
will get back to my wife,

133
00:07:44,372 --> 00:07:46,518
and somehow become my fault.

134
00:07:46,519 --> 00:07:48,919
That doesn't seem fair.

135
00:07:51,485 --> 00:07:52,861
So, where are you going?

136
00:07:52,862 --> 00:07:55,489
I'm helping Gloria with
the soccer league newsletter.

137
00:07:55,490 --> 00:07:59,350
I'm thinking of calling it "Just For Kicks."

138
00:07:59,431 --> 00:08:02,026
This is the same Gloria
who drives the kid van?

139
00:08:02,027 --> 00:08:04,773
- Yeah. Why?
- Nothing. Have fun.

140
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:09,045
Talk about not having a clue.

141
00:08:11,094 --> 00:08:13,496
And I designed a logo,

142
00:08:13,497 --> 00:08:16,637
the "K" in "Kicks" is a little foot.

143
00:08:16,638 --> 00:08:18,623
Sounds wonderful.

144
00:08:18,624 --> 00:08:22,564
I can't thank you enough
for taking the time to do this.

145
00:08:22,565 --> 00:08:24,551
Anything for the kids.

146
00:08:24,552 --> 00:08:26,410
You're such a good father.

147
00:08:26,411 --> 00:08:29,037
It's a shame that Judith
didn't appreciate you.

148
00:08:29,038 --> 00:08:31,664
She just needed
a little time to sort things out.

149
00:08:31,665 --> 00:08:34,255
But, yeah. It's a shame.

150
00:08:35,350 --> 00:08:36,792
Look at you.

151
00:08:36,793 --> 00:08:40,957
A successful chiropractor,
intelligent, dedicated.

152
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:43,360
You're embarrassing me.

153
00:08:43,522 --> 00:08:45,283
I'm sorry.

154
00:08:45,284 --> 00:08:48,405
Let's get back to your little logo.

155
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:54,377
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

156
00:08:54,448 --> 00:08:57,811
It's my neck. I must have slept wrong.

157
00:08:57,812 --> 00:09:00,984
Make an appointment with my office,
we'll see if we can fix that.

158
00:09:00,985 --> 00:09:03,385
No, I'd feel funny.

159
00:09:04,157 --> 00:09:06,303
We know each other.

160
00:09:06,304 --> 00:09:08,770
Don't be silly. It's what I do.

161
00:09:08,771 --> 00:09:11,171
Turn around. Go ahead.

162
00:09:13,833 --> 00:09:17,004
- Are you getting enough calcium?
- I guess.

163
00:09:17,005 --> 00:09:20,789
It's really important for a woman your age.

164
00:09:21,395 --> 00:09:24,065
Osteoporosis is a real problem.

165
00:09:24,504 --> 00:09:26,522
Curvature of the spine.

166
00:09:26,523 --> 00:09:30,709
Last thing you want
is to wind up with a hump.

167
00:09:32,481 --> 00:09:35,603
I hope you didn't start without me.

168
00:09:42,416 --> 00:09:45,330
- What are you talking about?
- Bill, you did this on purpose.

169
00:09:45,331 --> 00:09:47,573
You showed up late
so you could snoop on me.

170
00:09:47,574 --> 00:09:52,667
- You got to meet my girlfriend.
- What meet? She was our babysitter.

171
00:09:52,668 --> 00:09:54,399
Will you get out of here, Bill?

172
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:59,124
Kate, I'm trying.
Ernie, would you put your shoes on?

173
00:10:10,357 --> 00:10:12,757
- Bill.
- Charlie.

174
00:10:19,584 --> 00:10:21,985
That your Jag?

175
00:10:22,308 --> 00:10:24,708
- Yeah.
- It's nice.

176
00:10:28,204 --> 00:10:30,921
I got the Navigator over there.

177
00:10:32,721 --> 00:10:34,836
That's nice, too.

178
00:10:34,837 --> 00:10:37,238
Let's go, Dad.

179
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:44,477
All right, then.
You try and make her happy.

180
00:10:48,551 --> 00:10:51,657
Truthfully, I think
that my ex was intimidated

181
00:10:51,658 --> 00:10:54,059
by my sexual...

182
00:10:54,318 --> 00:10:58,150
I don't even know, how to say it. Appetite.

183
00:11:02,073 --> 00:11:06,525
So we're agreed we'll set aside
six inches for the editorial column?

184
00:11:06,526 --> 00:11:08,936
I'm sorry. Yes, six inches.

185
00:11:09,282 --> 00:11:11,812
I don't know how I got so off-topic.

186
00:11:11,813 --> 00:11:15,088
I know exactly how you got off-topic.

187
00:11:15,211 --> 00:11:18,894
I think the next piece of business
is to decide on the paper color.

188
00:11:18,895 --> 00:11:20,817
I brought some samples. We've got

189
00:11:20,818 --> 00:11:23,788
goldenrod, salmon, mustard...

190
00:11:23,861 --> 00:11:26,263
You had me at goldenrod.

191
00:11:27,738 --> 00:11:30,408
Everybody has you at goldenrod.

192
00:11:33,794 --> 00:11:36,677
My brother, Alan, warned me
not to go out with you tonight.

193
00:11:36,678 --> 00:11:37,959
That's funny.

194
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:41,003
Everybody warned me
not to go out with you.

195
00:11:41,004 --> 00:11:43,722
It worked for Romeo and Juliet,

196
00:11:44,015 --> 00:11:47,242
up until the poison and the stabbing.

197
00:11:47,604 --> 00:11:49,655
Charlie, I have a confession.

198
00:11:49,656 --> 00:11:53,532
I haven't been out with a man other
than my husband in 12 years.

199
00:11:53,533 --> 00:11:54,877
That's not a problem.

200
00:11:54,878 --> 00:11:57,537
A couple of things have changed,
I can bring you up to date.

201
00:11:57,538 --> 00:11:58,947
Please do.

202
00:11:58,948 --> 00:12:03,144
All right, well, nowadays,
women pay for dinner.

203
00:12:05,676 --> 00:12:08,365
And of course, sex is a given.

204
00:12:09,137 --> 00:12:12,340
I'll tell you one thing,
I am not paying for dinner.

205
00:12:12,341 --> 00:12:14,742
Rats.

206
00:12:17,051 --> 00:12:19,646
Look at the time.
Maybe we should get going.

207
00:12:19,647 --> 00:12:22,209
Give Gloria a chance
for a little quiet time before

208
00:12:22,210 --> 00:12:24,851
her many, many kids come home.

209
00:12:24,997 --> 00:12:27,465
I don't need any quiet time.

210
00:12:27,466 --> 00:12:28,618
Don't be silly.

211
00:12:28,619 --> 00:12:30,540
Alan, would you mind driving me home?

212
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:32,110
I'm feeling a little tipsy.

213
00:12:32,111 --> 00:12:35,347
A little tipsy? How about a little obvious?

214
00:12:35,348 --> 00:12:38,039
- I'm sorry?
- Could I talk to you for a minute?

215
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:41,622
- lt is getting a little late.
- Sit down.

216
00:12:42,846 --> 00:12:45,246
We'll be right back.

217
00:12:45,248 --> 00:12:48,677
I think she's going through the change.

218
00:12:49,382 --> 00:12:51,303
- What do you think you're doing?
- What?

219
00:12:51,304 --> 00:12:53,130
He's in play. I'm playing.

220
00:12:53,131 --> 00:12:55,373
I'm the one who told you he's in play.

221
00:12:55,374 --> 00:12:58,641
Please. I told you two years ago
that marriage was toast.

222
00:12:58,642 --> 00:13:00,116
So what?

223
00:13:00,117 --> 00:13:02,519
He's in my house
on tae kwon do Wednesday,

224
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:04,761
and I don't have time to
mess around with you.

225
00:13:04,762 --> 00:13:06,813
Why don't we just let him decide?

226
00:13:06,814 --> 00:13:08,319
Let him decide?

227
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:12,563
He still thinks we're doing
a soccer newsletter.

228
00:13:12,742 --> 00:13:16,851
- You don't even like him, do you?
- He's okay.

229
00:13:17,419 --> 00:13:20,031
He's here and it's Wednesday.

230
00:13:20,848 --> 00:13:22,610
I happen to think he's hot.

231
00:13:22,611 --> 00:13:24,981
You wouldn't know
what to do with a hot guy.

232
00:13:24,981 --> 00:13:27,383
Yeah? Well, watch me.

233
00:13:32,126 --> 00:13:34,528
Great. You broke him.

234
00:13:36,774 --> 00:13:39,976
The biggest surprise was how
much I loved having him around.

235
00:13:39,977 --> 00:13:41,771
I mean, Jake's amazing.

236
00:13:41,772 --> 00:13:48,149
Do you know I have, on occasion,
actually put his needs ahead of my own?

237
00:13:48,149 --> 00:13:50,742
Like going to a soccer game
at 8:00 am on a Saturday?

238
00:13:50,743 --> 00:13:51,832
Yes.

239
00:13:51,833 --> 00:13:55,612
At 8:00 am, I can barely get out
of bed to go to the bathroom.

240
00:13:55,613 --> 00:13:58,113
What you're saying
is having a child in your life

241
00:13:58,113 --> 00:14:00,163
totally changes the way
you look at things.

242
00:14:00,164 --> 00:14:02,564
Exactly.

243
00:14:03,239 --> 00:14:06,635
Of course, you probably
know that already.

244
00:14:06,636 --> 00:14:09,171
But I like that you know it.

245
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:12,872
- I had a really great time.
- Me, too.

246
00:14:12,981 --> 00:14:15,447
- Can we do this again?
- I would love that.

247
00:14:15,448 --> 00:14:17,849
Great.

248
00:14:29,066 --> 00:14:32,600
What happened?
Did I do something wrong?

249
00:14:33,552 --> 00:14:36,241
Please don't tell Alan's wife.

250
00:14:37,173 --> 00:14:40,093
No, you didn't do anything wrong.

251
00:14:40,441 --> 00:14:42,842
I really like you.

252
00:14:45,376 --> 00:14:47,777
Okay. This is new for me.

253
00:14:49,413 --> 00:14:51,814
It's just...

254
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:53,866
Charlie, I have a 10-year-old son.

255
00:14:53,867 --> 00:14:56,205
I have two mortgages,
private school bills,

256
00:14:56,206 --> 00:14:58,864
a full-time job, custody battles,
alimony battles,

257
00:14:58,865 --> 00:15:03,216
child support battles,
car pools and drum lessons.

258
00:15:04,761 --> 00:15:07,484
How can we possibly do this again?

259
00:15:07,485 --> 00:15:10,731
You bought a 10-year-old a drum set?

260
00:15:12,292 --> 00:15:16,263
Don't change the subject.
You know what I'm saying.

261
00:15:16,264 --> 00:15:19,971
Do you really want to be involved in this?

262
00:15:22,031 --> 00:15:25,461
I hadn't really thought that far ahead.

263
00:15:25,621 --> 00:15:28,021
Exactly.

264
00:15:28,825 --> 00:15:32,301
All right. I guess I'll see you around.

265
00:15:33,855 --> 00:15:35,680
Where are you going?

266
00:15:35,681 --> 00:15:38,083
- Home.
- Why?

267
00:15:38,086 --> 00:15:41,704
I said we couldn't do it again.
That doesn't mean we can't

268
00:15:41,705 --> 00:15:44,107
do it tonight.

269
00:15:48,499 --> 00:15:51,413
Boy, you really don't have a clue,
do you, Charlie?

270
00:15:51,414 --> 00:15:53,561
No.

271
00:15:53,562 --> 00:15:56,606
But it seems to be working for me.

272
00:16:06,723 --> 00:16:09,088
Morning.

273
00:16:14,303 --> 00:16:16,669
Regular or decaf?

274
00:16:17,335 --> 00:16:19,701
- Regular.
- Thank God.

275
00:16:30,791 --> 00:16:33,156
Aren't you even curious?

276
00:16:33,221 --> 00:16:35,937
- You went to Gloria's last night.
- Yeah.

277
00:16:35,938 --> 00:16:38,305
I can fill in the blanks.

278
00:16:45,128 --> 00:16:47,496
We're getting killed.

279
00:16:47,530 --> 00:16:49,992
We're here for fun, right?
Nobody wins or loses.

280
00:16:49,993 --> 00:16:52,625
Come on. Somebody always loses.

281
00:16:54,256 --> 00:16:55,740
Who are we kidding?

282
00:16:55,741 --> 00:16:59,026
It's 8-1 out there, and
everybody here knows it.

283
00:16:59,026 --> 00:17:01,552
And you know, I'll tell you another thing.

284
00:17:01,553 --> 00:17:04,111
We haven't won a game all season.

285
00:17:04,112 --> 00:17:06,574
And I'll put that in the newsletter.

286
00:17:06,575 --> 00:17:08,941
And as God as my witness,

287
00:17:09,607 --> 00:17:11,975
there will be a newsletter!

288
00:17:13,398 --> 00:17:17,582
Dad, you're kind of freaking
everybody out here.

289
00:17:17,788 --> 00:17:20,817
Forget it, Jake. It's Sherman Oaks.
