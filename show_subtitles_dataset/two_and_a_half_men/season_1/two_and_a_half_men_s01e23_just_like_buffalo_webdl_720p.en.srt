1
00:00:02,925 --> 00:00:04,153
You don't read to Jake.

2
00:00:04,259 --> 00:00:06,352
That's why you're going to the movies!

3
00:00:06,795 --> 00:00:07,921
Okay, ready to go.

4
00:00:07,997 --> 00:00:10,158
Is your skateboard still out
by the front door?

5
00:00:10,265 --> 00:00:13,428
- Sorry, I'll bring it in.
- No. Leave it there.

6
00:00:13,502 --> 00:00:16,938
See, I do this thing where
I trip over it, then I bitch a little bit.

7
00:00:17,006 --> 00:00:19,099
I'm harried, but lovable.

8
00:00:20,643 --> 00:00:21,803
- You got everything?
- Yep.

9
00:00:21,877 --> 00:00:24,209
- What about your schoolbooks?
- Oh, right.

10
00:00:25,981 --> 00:00:28,950
So, what time are you expecting
Little Red Riding Hood?

11
00:00:29,118 --> 00:00:31,450
And I'm the big, bad wolf.

12
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:34,148
Very clever.
And not a bad game to play later.

13
00:00:35,658 --> 00:00:38,525
A little huffing and puffing and blowing.

14
00:00:38,627 --> 00:00:40,060
That's The Three Little Pigs.

15
00:00:40,162 --> 00:00:41,527
Same wolf though, right?

16
00:00:42,631 --> 00:00:45,156
- Okay, I got my schoolbooks.
- And your homework?

17
00:00:48,470 --> 00:00:52,201
Charlie, if you took half the energy
you put into manipulating

18
00:00:52,307 --> 00:00:55,902
casual sexual encounters and used it
to actually build a relationship,

19
00:00:56,011 --> 00:00:57,535
you'd be a lot happier.

20
00:00:57,746 --> 00:00:58,906
Hard to imagine.

21
00:00:59,548 --> 00:01:02,016
Are you saying you never want
to settle down?

22
00:01:02,084 --> 00:01:03,745
You mean get married?

23
00:01:03,886 --> 00:01:05,478
Let me tell you something, bunky.

24
00:01:05,554 --> 00:01:08,580
If you've got someone to clean your house
and do your shopping

25
00:01:08,691 --> 00:01:12,559
and you're getting action on a regular
basis, the only reason you need a wife

26
00:01:12,661 --> 00:01:16,392
is if you have some sick compulsion
to give away half your stuff.

27
00:01:16,532 --> 00:01:19,126
- What about kids?
- I already got one!

28
00:01:19,802 --> 00:01:23,704
And the best part is he leaves before
we get sick of each other. Right, dude?

29
00:01:23,772 --> 00:01:25,967
- Right, dude.
- Okay, let's go.

30
00:01:26,141 --> 00:01:27,972
- Bye, Uncle Charlie.
- See you next week.

31
00:01:28,077 --> 00:01:31,513
- Where are your shoes?
- Oh, right.

32
00:01:33,782 --> 00:01:37,115
I have been so depressed since
the divorce, I've gained eight pounds.

33
00:01:37,186 --> 00:01:39,154
And not one ounce went to my boobs.

34
00:01:40,022 --> 00:01:42,786
Honey, you're still better off
without the rat bastard.

35
00:01:42,858 --> 00:01:44,985
But I miss the rat bastard.

36
00:01:45,661 --> 00:01:48,960
Listen to me, Kathleen.
I thought I missed my husband, too.

37
00:01:49,031 --> 00:01:52,592
But it turned out to be just
a little prescription mix-up.

38
00:01:53,102 --> 00:01:55,195
- Hi, Mom!
- And there's my big boy!

39
00:01:55,304 --> 00:01:58,273
- Don't I get a hug?
- Nope. Gotta drain the lizard.

40
00:01:59,708 --> 00:02:01,039
Boys.

41
00:02:01,877 --> 00:02:03,845
- Hey.
- Hi, Alan.

42
00:02:03,946 --> 00:02:06,107
- He left his homework in the car.
- Thank you.

43
00:02:06,181 --> 00:02:08,547
Hang on, I have some bills
you need to pay.

44
00:02:08,884 --> 00:02:12,650
Great. I hope they're really big ones.

45
00:02:16,658 --> 00:02:18,523
Hi. Alan.

46
00:02:21,964 --> 00:02:24,660
So you must be Judith's support group.

47
00:02:24,867 --> 00:02:28,462
That's funny because
I'm kind of supporting her, too.

48
00:02:31,173 --> 00:02:34,540
It's not funny ha-ha so much as not funny.

49
00:02:36,645 --> 00:02:40,979
Cookies! Maybe this will take
the taste of foot out of my mouth.

50
00:02:43,986 --> 00:02:46,546
So, who's the little baker among us?

51
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:53,220
Foot.

52
00:02:55,364 --> 00:02:57,628
- Can I have a cookie?
- Sure, sweetie.

53
00:02:58,133 --> 00:03:00,363
- You are so cute!
- I know.

54
00:03:01,804 --> 00:03:03,396
You have a girlfriend yet?

55
00:03:03,539 --> 00:03:05,871
No, I'm a bachelor like my Uncle Charlie.

56
00:03:05,941 --> 00:03:07,909
So, you're never going to get married?

57
00:03:07,976 --> 00:03:12,037
As long as I got someone to clean my
house and action on a regular basis,

58
00:03:12,114 --> 00:03:13,411
I don't need a wife.

59
00:03:16,051 --> 00:03:17,211
Excuse me?

60
00:03:17,286 --> 00:03:19,618
I don't want to give anybody half my stuff.

61
00:03:22,324 --> 00:03:24,053
Okay, bye-bye.

62
00:03:33,548 --> 00:03:37,484
This is my favorite part of the house.
I call it God's room.

63
00:03:39,287 --> 00:03:40,777
Are you religious?

64
00:03:41,890 --> 00:03:46,054
Tiffany, how can you not be
when you look at something like that?

65
00:03:49,998 --> 00:03:55,129
In fact, I'm always telling my
little nephew what's important is this.

66
00:03:56,338 --> 00:03:59,637
Not the big house, or the fancy car,

67
00:03:59,941 --> 00:04:03,104
or all the expensive toys
I'm always buying him.

68
00:04:07,982 --> 00:04:10,075
You are amazing.

69
00:04:10,151 --> 00:04:11,618
I don't know many guys that would

70
00:04:11,686 --> 00:04:14,246
make room in their lives
for someone else's child.

71
00:04:14,322 --> 00:04:16,017
He's family.

72
00:04:16,358 --> 00:04:20,192
What kind of a man doesn't make room
in his life for his own family?

73
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:26,726
Look, it's my brother Alan,
who I also made room in my life for.

74
00:04:28,403 --> 00:04:30,030
Excuse me.

75
00:04:31,673 --> 00:04:32,697
Bro!

76
00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:39,607
All right, you moron, what part of

77
00:04:39,681 --> 00:04:44,175
"stay out, so I can run around naked
with a hot chick" didn't you understand?

78
00:04:44,252 --> 00:04:47,244
I'm sorry, I'm too depressed
to sit through a movie.

79
00:04:47,355 --> 00:04:50,813
And you figured ruining my evening
would cheer you up?

80
00:04:53,528 --> 00:04:55,758
The movie was just a suggestion.

81
00:04:55,997 --> 00:04:59,091
Go bowling, go sit on the curb,
I don't care.

82
00:04:59,234 --> 00:05:00,895
Leave me alone!

83
00:05:01,169 --> 00:05:03,069
- Who's that?
- Judith. Again.

84
00:05:03,171 --> 00:05:04,900
She's really upset with me.

85
00:05:04,973 --> 00:05:06,600
- Man, I'm sorry.
- Thank you.

86
00:05:06,674 --> 00:05:07,834
Now get out.

87
00:05:08,843 --> 00:05:11,334
Get out? She's upset with me
because of you!

88
00:05:11,413 --> 00:05:13,005
That's different.

89
00:05:13,848 --> 00:05:15,406
But still, get out.

90
00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:19,684
Your sexist, manipulative attitude towards
women just got into Jake's head,

91
00:05:19,754 --> 00:05:23,383
and he spewed it out in front of his
mother's angry women's support group.

92
00:05:23,458 --> 00:05:26,586
Wait a minute. Is it a women's
support group that's angry?

93
00:05:26,761 --> 00:05:29,252
Or a support group just for angry women?

94
00:05:29,764 --> 00:05:31,425
What difference does it make?

95
00:05:31,566 --> 00:05:34,899
If they are already angry,
then I'm less culpable.

96
00:05:37,305 --> 00:05:39,364
Okay, what did Jake say?

97
00:05:39,607 --> 00:05:43,668
Not much. He just parroted your line
about how women are only good for sex

98
00:05:43,778 --> 00:05:45,575
and cleaning the house.

99
00:05:45,647 --> 00:05:48,844
Charlie, you didn't really say that?

100
00:05:49,484 --> 00:05:50,508
No.

101
00:05:51,686 --> 00:05:55,213
What I said was is that there is really
no reason to get married

102
00:05:55,290 --> 00:05:58,487
if you've already got somebody
to clean and...

103
00:06:01,296 --> 00:06:03,457
You want to go to the movies with me?

104
00:06:06,601 --> 00:06:08,865
Man, Jake's going to love this video game.

105
00:06:09,003 --> 00:06:13,463
Listen to this. "Sixteen levels
of ultra-realistic murder and mayhem,

106
00:06:14,843 --> 00:06:17,368
"twenty-four flesh-ripping weapons,

107
00:06:17,846 --> 00:06:20,144
"plus gratuitous nudity. "

108
00:06:20,949 --> 00:06:22,348
Let me see that.

109
00:06:23,485 --> 00:06:27,285
- "Scooter's Magic Tree Fort"?
- Scooter's a zombie.

110
00:06:33,194 --> 00:06:34,286
It's Tiffany.

111
00:06:34,629 --> 00:06:36,654
She still talking to you after last weekend?

112
00:06:36,798 --> 00:06:39,892
What can I tell you?
I am hard to stay mad at.

113
00:06:40,635 --> 00:06:44,298
Hello? Hey, Tiff.
I've been thinking about you all week.

114
00:06:47,542 --> 00:06:51,137
Yeah, we did get off to a bad start,
and I really blame myself.

115
00:06:51,212 --> 00:06:53,908
No, I'd love to try again.

116
00:06:55,216 --> 00:06:57,013
I'm going to go get Jake,

117
00:06:57,085 --> 00:07:01,454
but I'll leave the front door unlocked in
case Satan shows up to collect your soul.

118
00:07:01,556 --> 00:07:04,855
Wait a minute. Alan?
I gotta put you on hold a sec, Tiff.

119
00:07:05,059 --> 00:07:06,856
How come Judith's not bringing him over?

120
00:07:06,928 --> 00:07:10,557
I don't know. Judith asked me to do it,
and I just got tired of arguing.

121
00:07:10,632 --> 00:07:13,192
She still busting your chops
about what Jake said?

122
00:07:13,268 --> 00:07:15,236
Look, blame it on me.

123
00:07:15,303 --> 00:07:17,430
- Tell her I'm sorry.
- She won't buy it.

124
00:07:17,539 --> 00:07:20,702
Sure she will.
Women are suckers for a good apology.

125
00:07:21,809 --> 00:07:25,267
Just keep shoveling it
on till roses start growing in it.

126
00:07:26,247 --> 00:07:31,241
Poor Satan. He'll come for your soul
and he'll leave empty-handed.

127
00:07:35,623 --> 00:07:37,557
Hey, Tiff, I'm back.

128
00:07:37,625 --> 00:07:39,957
That's kind of harsh.

129
00:07:41,496 --> 00:07:43,623
Wait a minute. Hello?

130
00:07:46,668 --> 00:07:49,660
I see, that's not the hold button.

131
00:07:55,276 --> 00:07:57,767
- Hey, is Jake ready?
- Not exactly.

132
00:07:57,845 --> 00:08:00,143
Maybe you should come in for a second.

133
00:08:00,248 --> 00:08:04,116
Judith, how many times have I asked you
to have him ready when I...

134
00:08:05,587 --> 00:08:06,645
Hello.

135
00:08:06,754 --> 00:08:09,848
- Sit down, Alan. We want to talk to you.
- We?

136
00:08:10,158 --> 00:08:11,989
Yes. Sit down.

137
00:08:13,728 --> 00:08:15,059
Okay.

138
00:08:15,530 --> 00:08:18,465
I guess I can stay for a minute.

139
00:08:23,705 --> 00:08:27,334
- No cookies.
- No cookies.

140
00:08:28,676 --> 00:08:32,168
- Alan, Jake is not here.
- Why not? Where is he?

141
00:08:32,246 --> 00:08:35,306
- He's sleeping over at a friend's.
- What are you talking about?

142
00:08:35,383 --> 00:08:36,543
This is my time with him.

143
00:08:36,651 --> 00:08:39,484
- Yes, I know, but...
- Judith feels she can no longer

144
00:08:39,554 --> 00:08:43,251
allow her son to be exposed
to the toxic influence of your brother.

145
00:08:44,025 --> 00:08:46,585
Wait a second.
We have a custody agreement.

146
00:08:46,694 --> 00:08:50,391
Yes, but Judith feels that
the welfare of her son supersedes that.

147
00:08:51,332 --> 00:08:53,323
- You can't do this!
- Yes, she can.

148
00:08:53,401 --> 00:08:55,198
- Who are you?
- They are my friends.

149
00:08:55,269 --> 00:08:57,669
Wait. What the hell do your friends
have to do with this?

150
00:08:57,739 --> 00:09:00,537
- We love and support her.
- And we won't let you bully her.

151
00:09:00,608 --> 00:09:04,567
Wait. Okay, first of all, can the person
I talk to be the person who answers me?

152
00:09:04,679 --> 00:09:06,044
That's fair.

153
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:09,909
Okay, I don't want to talk to you people.
This is between me and Judith.

154
00:09:10,018 --> 00:09:13,249
You're absolutely right.
Judith, tell him what we agreed.

155
00:09:13,388 --> 00:09:17,916
Okay. You can see Jake on weekends,
but not at Charlie's house.

156
00:09:18,259 --> 00:09:19,556
But that's where I live.

157
00:09:19,627 --> 00:09:22,528
I'm sorry, Alan, but you're
just going to have to choose

158
00:09:22,597 --> 00:09:24,690
between your son and your brother.

159
00:09:24,966 --> 00:09:30,097
You know what? Maybe I have a problem
with Jake being in this toxic environment.

160
00:09:30,304 --> 00:09:34,741
And I am not leaving until you
bitter old crones are out of my house

161
00:09:34,809 --> 00:09:36,868
and I have my kid back!

162
00:09:42,283 --> 00:09:45,446
All right. You can stay. But I want my kid.

163
00:09:49,023 --> 00:09:51,116
Okay, I will go.

164
00:09:58,866 --> 00:10:00,891
- Morning.
- Hey.

165
00:10:03,838 --> 00:10:05,965
- Where are the pancakes?
- What pancakes?

166
00:10:06,307 --> 00:10:08,502
You always make pancakes
on Saturday morning.

167
00:10:08,576 --> 00:10:10,669
I make them for Jake. Jake's not here.

168
00:10:10,911 --> 00:10:13,607
- Kind of weird without him, huh?
- Yes.

169
00:10:14,248 --> 00:10:17,684
Would it lift your spirits
if you made pancakes for me?

170
00:10:19,453 --> 00:10:22,581
I'm sorry, man.
I told you to blame it all on me.

171
00:10:22,957 --> 00:10:25,755
Charlie, they had moved way past blame.

172
00:10:25,926 --> 00:10:27,689
It was more like a jihad.

173
00:10:30,231 --> 00:10:32,028
Except with no cookies.

174
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:35,698
Your big mistake was dealing
with them as a group.

175
00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:39,636
The trick with women is to split them
off from the herd, one by one.

176
00:10:40,374 --> 00:10:43,309
Otherwise, they spook
and you risk a stampede.

177
00:10:44,979 --> 00:10:46,310
Kind of like buffalo.

178
00:10:47,248 --> 00:10:49,944
In fact, I will bet that's where
that song comes from.

179
00:10:50,117 --> 00:10:53,416
Buffalo gals, won't you come out tonight
Come out tonight

180
00:10:53,487 --> 00:10:57,423
Do you hear yourself?
"Buffalo Gals"? Are you insane?

181
00:10:57,591 --> 00:11:00,617
This is the kind of talk
that started this whole mess!

182
00:11:00,728 --> 00:11:02,753
I didn't write the song, Alan.

183
00:11:05,099 --> 00:11:07,124
- Morning.
- Morning, Berta.

184
00:11:07,835 --> 00:11:10,895
- What, no pancakes?
- Jake's not here this weekend.

185
00:11:10,971 --> 00:11:12,131
Why not?

186
00:11:14,275 --> 00:11:17,176
Apparently Jake took something I said
out of context

187
00:11:17,244 --> 00:11:22,011
and repeated it in front of his mother
and she overreacted, as is her nature.

188
00:11:22,116 --> 00:11:23,743
What did you say, numbnuts?

189
00:11:23,817 --> 00:11:27,913
All I said was if your domestic chores
are taken care of by one woman

190
00:11:28,022 --> 00:11:30,650
and you have an active sexual life
with other women,

191
00:11:30,758 --> 00:11:32,783
you don't necessarily need
yet another woman

192
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:34,851
with whom to tie the matrimonial knot.

193
00:11:36,497 --> 00:11:38,658
And which category do I come in under?

194
00:11:39,967 --> 00:11:44,199
I got to say it's the sweet loving, Berta,
because this place is a mess.

195
00:11:45,606 --> 00:11:49,508
Morning, everybody. I brought
real maple syrup for the pancakes.

196
00:11:49,610 --> 00:11:52,044
- There's no pancakes, Rose.
- Because Jake's not here.

197
00:11:52,146 --> 00:11:54,273
Because Charlie's an idiot.

198
00:11:55,683 --> 00:11:59,847
Why? I mean, "Why is Jake not here?"
Not "Why is Charlie an idiot?"

199
00:12:01,188 --> 00:12:02,348
Because we know that.

200
00:12:02,456 --> 00:12:05,892
Hello? Where's my grandson?

201
00:12:06,727 --> 00:12:07,989
Oh, God, make this stop.

202
00:12:08,696 --> 00:12:10,027
Good morning, all.

203
00:12:10,130 --> 00:12:11,222
- Hi, Mom.
- Morning.

204
00:12:11,332 --> 00:12:13,323
- So, where's Jake?
- Ask Charlie.

205
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:17,200
- Yeah, ask him.
- Charlie?

206
00:12:21,575 --> 00:12:23,907
See? Just like buffalo.

207
00:12:28,983 --> 00:12:30,644
No, Evelyn, I am sorry.

208
00:12:30,718 --> 00:12:33,243
I want you to be able
to spend time with your grandson

209
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:35,720
but I just don't want him around Charlie.

210
00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:38,221
Why? Why do you think?

211
00:12:39,593 --> 00:12:40,855
That's right.

212
00:12:42,329 --> 00:12:46,766
No, his attitude toward women is not
a reflection on you or how you raised him.

213
00:12:46,867 --> 00:12:48,164
Yes, it is.

214
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:52,532
Look, there's someone at the door,
I've got to go.

215
00:12:52,773 --> 00:12:57,540
No, Evelyn, I don't think this would seem
less important if I was "getting a little. "

216
00:13:00,581 --> 00:13:04,347
- Judith, can't we talk about this?
- There's nothing to talk about, Charlie.

217
00:13:04,418 --> 00:13:07,114
Okay. Don't talk. Just listen.

218
00:13:07,388 --> 00:13:10,289
I love Jake and I would never
intentionally do anything

219
00:13:10,391 --> 00:13:14,054
- to influence him in a negative way.
- I don't care about your intentions.

220
00:13:14,128 --> 00:13:18,622
Okay, I am a jerk, I am immature,
I am self-centered, I am...

221
00:13:18,732 --> 00:13:19,858
Hi, I'm Charlie.

222
00:13:21,769 --> 00:13:23,862
Yes, we've heard about you.

223
00:13:23,937 --> 00:13:26,132
And I will bet none of it's good.

224
00:13:26,307 --> 00:13:28,468
- I am sorry, what is your name?
- Linda.

225
00:13:28,642 --> 00:13:30,303
Linda. Really?

226
00:13:30,477 --> 00:13:32,877
I once had my heart broken
by a woman named Linda.

227
00:13:32,946 --> 00:13:34,641
Charlie, we are having a meeting.

228
00:13:34,748 --> 00:13:36,943
And I'll bet it was about me.

229
00:13:37,318 --> 00:13:41,618
- Am I right? Come on, be honest.
- Mandy.

230
00:13:41,955 --> 00:13:45,322
Mandy. I love that song, Mandy.

231
00:13:47,294 --> 00:13:51,128
Listen, I know I can't come in here
and ask to be forgiven

232
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:54,632
for some of the stupid things
I have said in front of Jake.

233
00:13:55,402 --> 00:13:58,803
But I do have the right
to say I am sorry, don't I?

234
00:13:59,573 --> 00:14:01,063
I suppose.

235
00:14:03,277 --> 00:14:06,735
- Thank you. And you are?
- Kathleen.

236
00:14:08,315 --> 00:14:10,806
Kathleen, a fine Irish name.

237
00:14:11,652 --> 00:14:14,086
Half-Irish, on my mother's side.

238
00:14:14,655 --> 00:14:17,920
- Are you and your mom close?
- Yeah, I guess.

239
00:14:18,525 --> 00:14:20,459
I envy that, Kathleen.

240
00:14:21,595 --> 00:14:24,826
- Me and my mom...
- Okay, Charlie, give it a rest.

241
00:14:24,998 --> 00:14:28,798
We are not a bunch of sorority girls
you can charm with your big, brown eyes.

242
00:14:28,869 --> 00:14:30,359
And nice smile.

243
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:34,300
Thank you, Mandy.

244
00:14:34,875 --> 00:14:39,141
Linda, I admit I sometimes relate
to women on a very superficial level,

245
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:41,008
but I think that's because

246
00:14:41,115 --> 00:14:45,279
deep down, I have intimacy issues
that probably go back to my mom.

247
00:14:46,487 --> 00:14:48,978
My mother crippled me emotionally!

248
00:14:51,392 --> 00:14:52,518
You, too?

249
00:14:52,626 --> 00:14:55,891
And I am so afraid I'm making
the same mistakes with my daughter.

250
00:14:55,996 --> 00:14:58,556
- You know what...
- Ruth.

251
00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:05,971
That's the same fear
I have with Jake, Ruth.

252
00:15:06,206 --> 00:15:09,972
I've clearly made mistakes,
but that's because I'm human.

253
00:15:11,011 --> 00:15:14,572
And after all, what're we trying
to do with our children

254
00:15:14,815 --> 00:15:17,682
other than to raise them as humans?

255
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:23,478
Stop it, Charlie. "Our children"?
You have no children.

256
00:15:23,557 --> 00:15:27,653
That's true. Although I don't think it's fair
to throw it in my face.

257
00:15:30,831 --> 00:15:35,165
I mean, some of us haven't been blessed
with the little ones the way you have.

258
00:15:35,736 --> 00:15:37,601
That was uncalled for, Judith.

259
00:15:42,443 --> 00:15:47,346
Look, I'm being real up-front with you
about the mistakes I've made with Jake.

260
00:15:47,414 --> 00:15:49,348
How I've influenced him.

261
00:15:49,917 --> 00:15:53,444
But let's talk for a minute
about how he's influenced me.

262
00:15:54,054 --> 00:15:59,287
How this little boy has made me
a better man.

263
00:16:02,296 --> 00:16:05,231
Dear God! You are not going to listen
to this crap, are you?

264
00:16:05,299 --> 00:16:08,393
No, I will not...

265
00:16:09,369 --> 00:16:13,465
He's lying to you. That's all he does!
Lie! You've got to believe me.

266
00:16:13,874 --> 00:16:17,310
It's okay. It's all right, Judith.
We are all here for you.

267
00:16:24,585 --> 00:16:27,053
Okay, who's ready for a refill?

268
00:16:29,790 --> 00:16:31,314
That kid.

269
00:16:31,458 --> 00:16:33,824
What are you going to do, huh?

270
00:16:33,927 --> 00:16:35,827
Charlie, where's the little girl's room?

271
00:16:35,929 --> 00:16:39,421
It's down the hall to the right,
and around here we leave the seat up,

272
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:41,661
so don't just drop trou and back in.

273
00:16:42,402 --> 00:16:44,097
- You are terrible!
- I'm serious.

274
00:16:44,171 --> 00:16:46,731
I'm not coming in there with the shoehorn.

275
00:16:48,609 --> 00:16:50,839
You are getting a little pink there, Kathy.

276
00:16:50,944 --> 00:16:53,845
Turn around, I'll put
some more suntan lotion on your back.

277
00:16:53,947 --> 00:16:55,107
Okay.

278
00:16:58,118 --> 00:16:59,847
- Hi, Alan!
- Hello.

279
00:16:59,953 --> 00:17:03,252
- You have a lovely home.
- Thank you.

280
00:17:04,625 --> 00:17:06,024
What's happening?

281
00:17:06,126 --> 00:17:10,529
A bunch of us came over to have wine
in God's room. Why don't you join us?

282
00:17:10,697 --> 00:17:12,631
Thank you.

283
00:17:14,968 --> 00:17:16,299
What the hell?

284
00:17:16,870 --> 00:17:19,498
Buffalo Gals, won't you come out tonight

285
00:17:19,606 --> 00:17:22,200
Come out tonight, come out tonight

286
00:17:22,309 --> 00:17:25,301
Buffalo Gals, won't you come out tonight

287
00:17:25,379 --> 00:17:28,041
And dance by the light of the moon

288
00:17:35,055 --> 00:17:37,523
- Hey, Dad.
- Hey, pal!

289
00:17:38,225 --> 00:17:39,886
What's going on?

290
00:17:40,227 --> 00:17:43,287
- I want my friends back.
- I am sorry, what?

291
00:17:43,397 --> 00:17:45,388
- Hey, Uncle Charlie.
- There he is.

292
00:17:45,499 --> 00:17:47,797
How you doing, buddy?
We missed you around here!

293
00:17:47,868 --> 00:17:49,665
- I slept over at Toby's house.
- Cool!

294
00:17:49,736 --> 00:17:51,795
Jake, honey, go put your stuff
in your room.

295
00:17:51,872 --> 00:17:52,896
Okay.

296
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:56,570
- He's staying?
- Okay, here's the deal.

297
00:17:56,677 --> 00:18:00,636
We go back to the original custody
arrangement, but with one new condition.

298
00:18:00,714 --> 00:18:01,840
What's that?

299
00:18:01,915 --> 00:18:04,884
Charlie agrees to never, ever,
enter my house again.

300
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:07,980
Done.

301
00:18:10,023 --> 00:18:12,253
- You want some wine?
- Charlie...

302
00:18:13,727 --> 00:18:15,422
Yeah, sure, why not.

303
00:18:20,033 --> 00:18:21,193
How?

304
00:18:22,002 --> 00:18:24,527
I told you, I am hard to stay mad at.

305
00:18:27,541 --> 00:18:29,907
Anyway, they're your problem now.

306
00:18:30,611 --> 00:18:33,444
I am going to hang with Jake
till Tiffany gets here.

307
00:18:47,995 --> 00:18:49,121
What?

308
00:18:49,229 --> 00:18:51,390
You got a normal-sized head.

309
00:18:52,432 --> 00:18:54,957
Thanks. I am pretty happy with it.

310
00:18:55,435 --> 00:18:57,630
- I don't get it.
- What don't you get?

311
00:18:57,738 --> 00:19:01,265
I heard Mom say the reason
Uncle Charlie gets into so much trouble

312
00:19:01,341 --> 00:19:03,775
is because he thinks with his little head.

313
00:19:07,447 --> 00:19:09,005
It's not that little.

314
00:19:10,951 --> 00:19:13,749
- Okay, you tell your mother...
- Charlie.

315
00:19:14,821 --> 00:19:17,312
That women are to
be honored and respected.

316
00:19:17,424 --> 00:19:19,949
See, Jake? That's the big head talking.

317
00:19:20,027 --> 00:19:22,120
But he only has one head.

318
00:19:24,665 --> 00:19:27,691
You want to tell him
or should we let him spin for a while?

319
00:19:27,801 --> 00:19:29,359
I'd rather he spin.

320
00:19:29,503 --> 00:19:31,937
Come on, at least give me a clue.

321
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:34,634
All right.

322
00:19:35,442 --> 00:19:37,569
What do men have that women don't?

323
00:19:38,178 --> 00:19:39,270
Beards.

324
00:19:40,747 --> 00:19:44,274
- Lower.
- Beards.

325
00:19:50,624 --> 00:19:52,649
You're right, let him spin.

326
00:20:22,055 --> 00:20:23,249
English
