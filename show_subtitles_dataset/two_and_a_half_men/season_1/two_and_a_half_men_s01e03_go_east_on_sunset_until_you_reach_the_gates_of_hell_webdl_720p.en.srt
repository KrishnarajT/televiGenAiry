1
00:00:01,543 --> 00:00:02,840
Hello, Charlie.

2
00:00:02,944 --> 00:00:04,969
Hi, Judith. What're you doing here?

3
00:00:05,046 --> 00:00:07,776
If you must know, I'm here to help
Jake set up his room,

4
00:00:07,849 --> 00:00:09,578
so he feels like nothing's changed.

5
00:00:09,651 --> 00:00:12,643
Really? You don't think he'll notice
his dad's living here

6
00:00:12,721 --> 00:00:14,018
and his mom's dating chicks?

7
00:00:15,657 --> 00:00:18,785
Could you say that a little louder?
Jake might not have heard you.

8
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:20,885
Just for the record, I'm not
dating anyone,

9
00:00:20,962 --> 00:00:24,454
and I threw your brother out 'cause
he was sucking the life out of me.

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,798
Could you say that a little louder?

11
00:00:27,969 --> 00:00:30,199
Uncle Charlie hasn't met Porky yet!

12
00:00:30,305 --> 00:00:33,297
I don't suppose that's a
Rubenesque 19-year-old girl.

13
00:00:33,875 --> 00:00:36,070
Porky's his pet guinea pig.

14
00:00:36,144 --> 00:00:38,840
You're bringing vermin into my house?

15
00:00:39,481 --> 00:00:42,177
Uncle Charlie, check him out!
Isn't he awesome?

16
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:43,444
Yeah.

17
00:00:43,518 --> 00:00:45,918
See those little black things?
That's his poop.

18
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:49,687
Awesome.

19
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:54,388
I don't want him in the water this
weekend. He might have an ear infection.

20
00:00:54,529 --> 00:00:55,723
Oh, Mom.

21
00:00:55,797 --> 00:00:58,960
No, it's okay, pal.
We can go to Disneyland.

22
00:00:59,067 --> 00:01:00,557
We'll have a great weekend.

23
00:01:00,635 --> 00:01:04,196
We can play miniature golf, go bowling,
bike riding, whatever you want.

24
00:01:04,272 --> 00:01:07,730
Alan, relax, you're starting to
sound like a tampon commercial.

25
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:13,710
Jake, why don't you go put Porky
in your room?

26
00:01:13,782 --> 00:01:15,079
Okay.

27
00:01:15,617 --> 00:01:19,781
Alan, I'm very concerned. He's just a child.
I don't know if he can deal with this.

28
00:01:19,888 --> 00:01:22,482
Give your son some credit.
He's an incredible kid.

29
00:01:22,624 --> 00:01:24,615
I was talking about you.

30
00:01:26,495 --> 00:01:28,258
- That's fair.
- Yeah.

31
00:01:49,884 --> 00:01:54,116
Charlie? That strange lady
from down the beach is back.

32
00:01:56,591 --> 00:01:59,253
Yeah, she's here to baby-sit.

33
00:02:02,029 --> 00:02:03,553
Come again?

34
00:02:04,265 --> 00:02:06,199
I thought we'd go out and have a drink.

35
00:02:06,267 --> 00:02:09,862
You want me to leave my son with the
whack job who's been stalking you

36
00:02:09,937 --> 00:02:11,928
since your one night stand?

37
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:15,200
You try and find a
baby-sitter on a Friday night.

38
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:19,541
It's okay, Alan.
Charlie and I talked and I understand

39
00:02:19,614 --> 00:02:22,640
that we're just friends,
and that it is not okay for me

40
00:02:22,717 --> 00:02:25,447
to sneak into his house
and lick all his silverware.

41
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:36,287
As reassuring as that sounds,
we can't go out tonight.

42
00:02:36,397 --> 00:02:38,558
We're getting up early to go to Disneyland.

43
00:02:38,633 --> 00:02:39,691
We?

44
00:02:39,767 --> 00:02:42,395
Yeah. I thought that maybe
you'd want to come with us.

45
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:46,065
Alan, I'm not thrilled about having one
small rodent in my house.

46
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:49,234
Why would I drive fifty miles
to see their kingdom?

47
00:02:50,811 --> 00:02:52,608
I'll go!

48
00:02:54,448 --> 00:02:58,646
Maybe some other time, Rose. It turns out
we're not gonna need a babysitter tonight.

49
00:02:58,753 --> 00:03:02,086
No problem.
I'm gonna take this seat cushion, okay?

50
00:03:04,759 --> 00:03:06,488
Knock yourself out.

51
00:03:08,029 --> 00:03:09,929
Why does she want your seat cushion?

52
00:03:09,997 --> 00:03:13,364
I don't know why she brought it,
I don't know why she's taking it.

53
00:03:15,836 --> 00:03:17,428
Okay, then, I'll see you later.

54
00:03:17,505 --> 00:03:19,837
Wait, you're still going out?

55
00:03:20,041 --> 00:03:21,633
Yeah. Why?

56
00:03:21,842 --> 00:03:24,777
I thought you wanted us
to spend some time together.

57
00:03:24,845 --> 00:03:26,005
Here?

58
00:03:28,683 --> 00:03:29,809
Okay.

59
00:03:48,202 --> 00:03:49,931
What're you thinking? 10, 15 minutes?

60
00:03:50,004 --> 00:03:51,198
- Go.
- Thanks.

61
00:03:59,747 --> 00:04:02,011
Good morning, Uncle Charlie.

62
00:04:02,483 --> 00:04:04,075
Morning, Porky.

63
00:04:04,719 --> 00:04:06,846
Did you have sweet dreams?

64
00:04:08,723 --> 00:04:12,386
Jake, rule number one.
Uncle Charlie does not like

65
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:15,588
to start his day with a
squealing creature in his face.

66
00:04:15,696 --> 00:04:19,097
Sorry. Grandma's here.
She wants you to come down.

67
00:04:19,233 --> 00:04:21,201
Okay, you're not listening.

68
00:04:21,736 --> 00:04:23,397
Rule number one...

69
00:04:25,673 --> 00:04:28,733
This is a list of the top divorce
attorneys in Los Angeles.

70
00:04:28,843 --> 00:04:31,107
I've made appointments for you
with each of them.

71
00:04:31,212 --> 00:04:34,238
I don't need to meet any attorneys.
I'm not getting a divorce.

72
00:04:34,348 --> 00:04:36,373
I'm sure you don't think so.

73
00:04:38,919 --> 00:04:41,251
The point is, if you consult with all

74
00:04:41,355 --> 00:04:45,689
the good lawyers, it's a conflict of
interest for them to represent Judith.

75
00:04:45,793 --> 00:04:48,819
She'll be stuck with some ambulance-
chasing clown from Van Nuys

76
00:04:48,896 --> 00:04:51,160
who will fold like an origami swan.

77
00:04:51,766 --> 00:04:53,233
I don't want this to be...

78
00:04:53,301 --> 00:04:55,462
Mommy busted her hump on this, Alan.

79
00:04:58,906 --> 00:04:59,964
Thank you?

80
00:05:01,709 --> 00:05:03,108
Morning.

81
00:05:05,379 --> 00:05:07,813
Is that all you have to say for yourself?

82
00:05:09,083 --> 00:05:11,449
You haven't returned any
of my calls this week.

83
00:05:11,552 --> 00:05:15,955
It's all I can do to not imagine you
lying dead in a ditch somewhere.

84
00:05:17,391 --> 00:05:18,756
Right back at ya, Mom.

85
00:05:23,431 --> 00:05:24,921
What did you want to talk about?

86
00:05:24,999 --> 00:05:27,331
Too late. I'm not speaking to you.

87
00:05:27,435 --> 00:05:29,801
- All right.
- Would you like to know why?

88
00:05:30,504 --> 00:05:32,665
No, I trust your judgment.

89
00:05:33,741 --> 00:05:36,175
Because when your
brother's marriage ended,

90
00:05:36,277 --> 00:05:39,110
yes, I know, Alan, blah, blah, blah,

91
00:05:40,014 --> 00:05:43,677
and he chose to move in here, your
coldness towards your mother

92
00:05:43,784 --> 00:05:46,776
became more than just the behavior
of an ungrateful son.

93
00:05:46,854 --> 00:05:50,950
It's now an obstacle to my spending
quality time with my beloved grandchild.

94
00:05:52,927 --> 00:05:55,157
Are you coming to Disneyland with us,
Grandma?

95
00:05:55,262 --> 00:05:58,527
Darling, Grandma doesn't do Anaheim.

96
00:05:59,767 --> 00:06:03,669
We'd better hit the road. Try to beat
the traffic. Thanks for dropping by, Mom.

97
00:06:03,771 --> 00:06:05,568
Let's go, Jake. I'll race you to the car.

98
00:06:05,673 --> 00:06:07,470
- Bye, Grandma. Bye, Uncle Charlie.
- Bye.

99
00:06:13,314 --> 00:06:15,305
Wait for me, I'm going!

100
00:06:37,571 --> 00:06:42,270
Come on, boy. Heel. Stay. Now, stay.

101
00:06:42,376 --> 00:06:46,403
Who's a good dog? Oh, yeah!

102
00:06:47,615 --> 00:06:49,708
Hey, Jake, you want to take him?

103
00:06:49,784 --> 00:06:51,911
Whatever. Come on, leash.

104
00:06:54,522 --> 00:06:58,424
Get ready for bed.
I'll be right in to tuck you in.

105
00:07:01,061 --> 00:07:04,053
Happiest place on earth,
my snow white ass.

106
00:07:09,904 --> 00:07:11,633
I had a good time.

107
00:07:13,374 --> 00:07:17,037
Oh, really? Which part did you like best?

108
00:07:17,178 --> 00:07:20,875
The equatorial heat, the endless
lines, or the large German woman that

109
00:07:20,948 --> 00:07:22,916
threw up on me in the Teacup?

110
00:07:25,386 --> 00:07:30,153
Maybe things could have gone smoother,
but tomorrow's gonna make up for it.

111
00:07:30,591 --> 00:07:34,493
Alan, you could get us all laid
tomorrow, it's not gonna make up for it.

112
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:43,827
Hey, sleepy head. You're just in time.
Your pancakes are almost ready.

113
00:07:43,904 --> 00:07:45,303
I'm not hungry.

114
00:07:45,739 --> 00:07:48,902
Not hungry?
Come on, you've gotta fuel up that engine.

115
00:07:48,976 --> 00:07:52,810
- We've got a big day planned.
- My ear hurts.

116
00:07:53,614 --> 00:07:54,842
Oh, no.

117
00:07:56,150 --> 00:07:59,642
Let me feel. Yeah, you're a little warm.

118
00:08:00,354 --> 00:08:02,982
Probably another ear infection.

119
00:08:03,257 --> 00:08:05,282
Okay, new plan.

120
00:08:05,359 --> 00:08:08,851
We'll get you on the antibiotics,
we'll watch a little TV,

121
00:08:08,929 --> 00:08:11,864
play some video games.
We'll have a great day.

122
00:08:11,966 --> 00:08:13,695
I want to go home.

123
00:08:13,801 --> 00:08:15,666
You are home.

124
00:08:15,769 --> 00:08:18,329
I know, but the real one, with Mom.

125
00:08:22,977 --> 00:08:26,538
Okay, I understand that.
You know, when a guy's feeling sick,

126
00:08:26,614 --> 00:08:28,946
he needs his mom. Right, Charlie?

127
00:08:29,016 --> 00:08:30,040
Well,

128
00:08:32,686 --> 00:08:34,517
I may not be the one to ask.

129
00:08:35,689 --> 00:08:39,284
Okay, I'll, call your mom and,
tell her we're on our way.

130
00:08:41,896 --> 00:08:45,627
All right, it's just you and me now.
Are you really sick, or are you just

131
00:08:45,699 --> 00:08:48,224
fakin' it to get out of another
fun-filled afternoon?

132
00:08:48,335 --> 00:08:49,962
I'm really sick.

133
00:08:50,037 --> 00:08:52,665
Just checking.
Because I was gonna fake it.

134
00:08:57,378 --> 00:09:02,543
If your home is bug infested
filled with spiders, flies or gnats

135
00:09:02,683 --> 00:09:08,588
All our sprays are safety tested
we kill vermin, not your cats

136
00:09:10,591 --> 00:09:13,082
Hey. How's the jingle coming?

137
00:09:13,694 --> 00:09:16,925
The lyrics are fine,
the music needs a little work.

138
00:09:18,532 --> 00:09:19,556
How's Jake?

139
00:09:19,767 --> 00:09:22,702
He'll be okay.
I stayed over at the house a little while.

140
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:26,001
We watched some movies,
I made us some soup and a couple of

141
00:09:26,073 --> 00:09:29,907
sandwiches,
and Judith suggested I take mine to go.

142
00:09:31,078 --> 00:09:32,443
Suggested?

143
00:09:32,713 --> 00:09:35,876
She started my car and threw my
sandwich in the back seat.

144
00:09:36,417 --> 00:09:37,714
That's rough.

145
00:09:38,552 --> 00:09:41,953
Listen, I'm afraid I got some more
bad news for you.

146
00:09:42,056 --> 00:09:45,116
No, gosh, I forgot to bring Porky back.

147
00:09:45,893 --> 00:09:50,091
See, that's the thing.
Nothing's bringing Porky back.

148
00:09:51,899 --> 00:09:54,333
What? Porky's dead?

149
00:09:54,702 --> 00:09:57,398
"Buh-dee, buh-dee, buh-dee,
that's all folks!"

150
00:10:01,175 --> 00:10:02,506
Oh, God.

151
00:10:07,214 --> 00:10:11,241
It's okay.
We can get Jake another guinea pig.

152
00:10:11,685 --> 00:10:15,519
Jake will be fine.
This is his fourth Porky in three years.

153
00:10:17,925 --> 00:10:20,587
He goes through them faster than shoes.

154
00:10:21,629 --> 00:10:23,927
No, this is about my life.

155
00:10:25,265 --> 00:10:26,789
Everything is going to hell.

156
00:10:27,768 --> 00:10:31,602
Okay, well, don't cry.
We can still be friends.

157
00:10:34,742 --> 00:10:35,902
What?

158
00:10:36,076 --> 00:10:39,773
I'm sorry. It's the only thing I know to
say when someone cries around here.

159
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:45,115
I am so sorry, Porky.

160
00:10:46,286 --> 00:10:48,811
You just kept running around
in your little cage,

161
00:10:48,922 --> 00:10:52,483
trying to make everybody
happy. And what do you get?

162
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:54,950
You get dead.

163
00:10:56,797 --> 00:10:59,766
You do know the pig can't hear you, right?

164
00:11:00,234 --> 00:11:03,328
Don't you get it? I am the pig!

165
00:11:03,637 --> 00:11:08,665
Okay. I'm just asking, because your
reaction doesn't seem very healthy to me.

166
00:11:08,776 --> 00:11:11,006
And what do you think would be healthy,
Charlie?

167
00:11:11,111 --> 00:11:14,638
I don't know. Why don't we toss Porky
in the ocean and go get bombed?

168
00:11:19,053 --> 00:11:22,079
How could you?

169
00:11:23,891 --> 00:11:24,915
Okay.

170
00:11:35,548 --> 00:11:39,143
Toss him in the ocean. Very clever.

171
00:11:40,186 --> 00:11:42,711
Who knew pelicans eat guinea pigs?

172
00:11:49,129 --> 00:11:50,824
What's happening?

173
00:11:52,532 --> 00:11:55,126
Sunday's Tequila Night at Pavlov's.

174
00:11:55,201 --> 00:11:57,669
Every time the bell rings,
you gotta take a shot.

175
00:11:58,138 --> 00:11:59,196
Why?

176
00:12:00,073 --> 00:12:02,007
'Cause the bell rings.

177
00:12:03,376 --> 00:12:04,502
Okay.

178
00:12:04,577 --> 00:12:06,477
You gotta bark first.

179
00:12:13,219 --> 00:12:14,243
Charlie,

180
00:12:14,721 --> 00:12:19,090
when my son looked at me and told me
that he wanted to go "home",

181
00:12:20,493 --> 00:12:22,085
that broke my heart.

182
00:12:22,195 --> 00:12:23,423
I saw.

183
00:12:23,563 --> 00:12:27,192
You know, my kid is sick,
and I can't even be with him.

184
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:32,096
You know, I'm a failure, Charlie.
I'm a failure as a father,

185
00:12:32,205 --> 00:12:33,604
I'm a failure as a husband.

186
00:12:33,706 --> 00:12:38,439
You didn't fail.
First of all, that little boy loves you.

187
00:12:38,511 --> 00:12:41,639
Second of all, just because your wife
decides she doesn't like

188
00:12:41,714 --> 00:12:44,512
sleeping with men, doesn't mean
you've failed as a husband.

189
00:12:44,584 --> 00:12:47,178
Although, I wouldn't brag about it.

190
00:12:47,854 --> 00:12:50,550
You're right. This is Judith's fault.

191
00:12:50,623 --> 00:12:53,922
She's the one who breached our
marriage contract asunder.

192
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:58,827
And I let her make decisions that
should have been in my dominion.

193
00:13:00,433 --> 00:13:04,369
Alan, people are gonna do whatever
they're gonna do in this world.

194
00:13:04,604 --> 00:13:08,096
The only thing a man can control
is his own actions.

195
00:13:18,084 --> 00:13:20,450
I don't remember where we left our car.

196
00:13:22,555 --> 00:13:24,352
This isn't our car?

197
00:13:26,559 --> 00:13:27,617
Where to?

198
00:13:27,727 --> 00:13:28,955
Home.

199
00:13:29,596 --> 00:13:32,565
- And that would be?
- Sherman Oaks.

200
00:13:32,632 --> 00:13:34,259
We don't live in Sherman Oaks.

201
00:13:34,367 --> 00:13:37,461
I do. I am a Sherman Oaksian and I am

202
00:13:37,537 --> 00:13:40,404
going home for as to reclaim my home.

203
00:13:41,975 --> 00:13:46,435
That's a very bad idea.
I'll tell you what's a good idea.

204
00:13:46,713 --> 00:13:50,979
Chili cheese fries and a large root
beer. With chili cheese fries.

205
00:13:52,252 --> 00:13:53,617
And girls.

206
00:13:55,154 --> 00:14:00,057
No. I am going home to my wife

207
00:14:00,126 --> 00:14:02,492
to impose my dominion over her.

208
00:14:03,096 --> 00:14:05,826
Yeah. The lesbians love that.

209
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:09,996
Driver! Sherman Oaks!

210
00:14:12,238 --> 00:14:15,264
1167, Bonnie Meadow Drive.

211
00:14:15,508 --> 00:14:19,239
Goodbye, Charlie.
I'll be back for my things tomorrow.

212
00:14:19,312 --> 00:14:22,179
Thank you, driver. You've been most kind.

213
00:14:30,623 --> 00:14:32,420
So, back to Malibu?

214
00:14:32,859 --> 00:14:34,986
No. Let's give it a second.

215
00:14:38,998 --> 00:14:43,765
Did you know they put
chocolate pudding in tubes now?

216
00:14:44,037 --> 00:14:46,870
No, I did not.

217
00:14:47,974 --> 00:14:51,774
They do. My nephew eats them.

218
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:56,273
They're surprisingly good.

219
00:15:00,119 --> 00:15:02,451
You know, that's an interesting
sibling dynamic

220
00:15:02,522 --> 00:15:04,490
you've got goin' with your brother there.

221
00:15:06,993 --> 00:15:09,621
You get that I'm loaded, right?

222
00:15:12,532 --> 00:15:14,124
Drive!

223
00:15:19,539 --> 00:15:23,100
So? How'd it go?

224
00:15:25,011 --> 00:15:28,208
She chased me out of the house
with a golf club.

225
00:15:31,484 --> 00:15:33,213
Taking up golf already.

226
00:15:35,188 --> 00:15:36,951
What was it like, a six iron?

227
00:15:37,023 --> 00:15:38,615
What difference does it make?

228
00:15:38,691 --> 00:15:41,888
I just want to be able to
tell the story accurately.

229
00:15:51,137 --> 00:15:52,661
It's not funny.

230
00:15:52,905 --> 00:15:55,203
Then why are you laughing?

231
00:15:55,508 --> 00:15:57,669
Because I don't know what else to do.

232
00:15:59,746 --> 00:16:02,146
I wish I could ask Dad for advice.

233
00:16:02,649 --> 00:16:05,243
You'd go to Dad for marriage counseling?

234
00:16:05,818 --> 00:16:09,151
Alan, our father committed suicide
to get away from our mother.

235
00:16:09,222 --> 00:16:13,158
What're you talking about? Dad didn't
commit suicide. He died of food poisoning.

236
00:16:13,226 --> 00:16:17,026
I maintain that he knew the fish was
bad, but he kept eating it anyway.

237
00:16:18,531 --> 00:16:21,432
Your mother sounds like
a real piece of work.

238
00:16:22,535 --> 00:16:25,436
You have no idea, my friend.

239
00:16:25,538 --> 00:16:29,998
My mother took my baby brother
and dipped him in sissy sauce

240
00:16:30,777 --> 00:16:34,076
and turned him into the people-pleasing
control freak you see today.

241
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:38,514
That's right!
And she made him so scared of intimacy

242
00:16:38,584 --> 00:16:41,678
that he has just this
endless stream of gorgeous girls

243
00:16:41,754 --> 00:16:43,722
running in and out of his life.

244
00:16:43,790 --> 00:16:45,155
Damn her.

245
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:52,595
You know, many psychologists agree,
until the core maternal relationship

246
00:16:52,665 --> 00:16:57,500
is resolved, most men are doomed to
repeat dysfunctional childhood patterns.

247
00:16:58,571 --> 00:17:01,005
Just drive the cab, Doctor Phil.

248
00:17:02,442 --> 00:17:05,411
You know what, Charlie? He's not wrong.

249
00:17:05,511 --> 00:17:08,105
At some point, we have to stand up to her.

250
00:17:08,214 --> 00:17:10,614
Look who's got beer muscles
all of a sudden.

251
00:17:10,717 --> 00:17:12,912
No, I'm serious. Come on. Right now.

252
00:17:13,019 --> 00:17:17,115
Let's confront her. You with me? Come on!

253
00:17:17,423 --> 00:17:19,186
Oh, my God.

254
00:17:20,026 --> 00:17:23,120
I can't believe it!
You really are afraid of Mom!

255
00:17:23,463 --> 00:17:24,794
I am not.

256
00:17:25,064 --> 00:17:27,555
All these years,
I thought you were so cool.

257
00:17:27,633 --> 00:17:30,101
But you're just a big clucking chicken!

258
00:17:30,203 --> 00:17:31,227
Ouch.

259
00:17:32,672 --> 00:17:33,764
Ouch?

260
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:37,105
Okay, that's it. We have a new destination.

261
00:17:37,343 --> 00:17:38,901
Beverly Hills.

262
00:17:39,178 --> 00:17:40,736
You got an address?

263
00:17:40,813 --> 00:17:44,772
Just go east on Sunset until
you reach the Gates of Hell.

264
00:17:48,087 --> 00:17:49,816
She'll buzz us in.

265
00:17:54,494 --> 00:17:56,189
I can't wait to see her face.

266
00:17:56,295 --> 00:17:58,024
She's gonna freak.

267
00:17:59,465 --> 00:18:00,864
You ready?

268
00:18:00,967 --> 00:18:03,299
Ring the bell.

269
00:18:13,946 --> 00:18:15,311
Who is it?

270
00:18:16,182 --> 00:18:17,774
It's your sons!

271
00:18:18,584 --> 00:18:20,245
Charlie and Alan.

272
00:18:25,324 --> 00:18:26,621
Hi, Mom.

273
00:18:28,928 --> 00:18:31,920
Dear God. Hold on. I'll be right there.

274
00:18:32,832 --> 00:18:35,801
Okay, what exactly are we
gonna say to her?

275
00:18:36,302 --> 00:18:39,328
Now you ask? This was your safari.

276
00:18:39,672 --> 00:18:43,108
We're here to resolve the core
maternal thing.

277
00:18:43,176 --> 00:18:45,474
Wait, I'll go ask the cabbie.

278
00:18:47,213 --> 00:18:48,703
Nice try.

279
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:56,145
Somebody better be dead.

280
00:18:57,623 --> 00:18:59,113
Porky's dead.

281
00:19:02,128 --> 00:19:04,995
And you completely screwed up our lives.

282
00:19:05,631 --> 00:19:06,655
I'm sorry?

283
00:19:06,732 --> 00:19:09,166
- That's good enough for me.
- Yeah, I'm good.

284
00:19:10,536 --> 00:19:12,128
Driver, drive!

285
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:22,341
Good morning, sunshine.

286
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:28,914
God. Close the drapes.

287
00:19:31,724 --> 00:19:36,252
Hey, what's this?
"Release and indemnification form. "

288
00:19:37,230 --> 00:19:38,424
What?

289
00:19:38,764 --> 00:19:41,733
Were you on some kind of
television show last night?

290
00:19:42,201 --> 00:19:43,361
I don't think so.

291
00:19:43,436 --> 00:19:45,768
You and your brother signed it.

292
00:19:45,872 --> 00:19:47,703
Let me see that.

293
00:19:50,176 --> 00:19:51,200
Alan.

294
00:19:53,179 --> 00:19:55,511
Alan, wake up.

295
00:19:59,385 --> 00:20:01,080
We got a problem.

296
00:20:04,824 --> 00:20:06,724
"Taxicab Confessions?"

297
00:20:09,695 --> 00:20:11,686
If you've got bugs

298
00:20:12,098 --> 00:20:14,532
If you've got ants

299
00:20:15,268 --> 00:20:18,726
If you've got bugs and flies and
slugs and things that crawl

300
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:22,564
Ain't that Beethoven?

301
00:20:25,845 --> 00:20:30,339
I don't even know how my wife
is gonna be a lesbian.

302
00:20:31,284 --> 00:20:33,252
She hates oral sex.

303
00:20:33,519 --> 00:20:34,952
Hates it!

304
00:21:03,149 --> 00:21:04,343
English
