1
00:00:04,954 --> 00:00:07,388
No, if you want to stay in that house,

2
00:00:07,456 --> 00:00:10,584
and drive that car,
then I have to live here to save money.

3
00:00:11,227 --> 00:00:14,719
No. I don't agree that
he's a bad influence on Jake.

4
00:00:19,202 --> 00:00:21,568
Uncle Charlie,
I understand the point spread,

5
00:00:21,637 --> 00:00:24,105
but I'm still confused about the vig.

6
00:00:25,408 --> 00:00:26,466
Okay.

7
00:00:26,576 --> 00:00:29,841
Vig is short for vigorish,
and it means the percentage you pay

8
00:00:29,946 --> 00:00:33,404
- to a bookie to take your bet.
- So it's better to be a bookie.

9
00:00:33,482 --> 00:00:35,450
My little boy is growing up.

10
00:00:37,186 --> 00:00:38,346
Judith, hang on.

11
00:00:38,454 --> 00:00:41,514
I have got to stop you here,
because right at this very minute,

12
00:00:41,624 --> 00:00:43,785
I am watching Charlie
help Jake with math.

13
00:00:46,963 --> 00:00:50,956
Well, go ahead and call your lawyers,
but I think I am well within my rights here.

14
00:00:51,267 --> 00:00:55,533
Well, I don't know what Jake is telling you
about Charlie's dates,

15
00:00:55,638 --> 00:00:58,835
but he is a kid,
and he blows things out of proportion.

16
00:00:58,908 --> 00:01:02,036
Well, if by nude swimming you mean,

17
00:01:02,144 --> 00:01:05,910
she had no bathing suit on whatsoever,

18
00:01:06,048 --> 00:01:07,538
then that never happened.

19
00:01:28,071 --> 00:01:31,370
I can see the clothes hamper
was a wise purchase.

20
00:01:34,144 --> 00:01:37,170
- Berta?
- No, it's Liz Hurley, but I'm holding water.

21
00:01:39,249 --> 00:01:41,683
I'm still sleeping here.
Could you come back in a little while?

22
00:01:41,752 --> 00:01:43,845
I could,
or you could get your pampered ass

23
00:01:43,921 --> 00:01:45,912
out of bed
and let me do my demeaning job

24
00:01:46,023 --> 00:01:48,082
and get on with my hellish life.

25
00:01:49,593 --> 00:01:52,721
Excuse me, Berta, but last time I checked,
you work for me.

26
00:01:52,829 --> 00:01:55,229
So I'll get up when I'm good and ready.

27
00:01:59,603 --> 00:02:02,037
Sorry I had to pull rank on you.

28
00:02:07,611 --> 00:02:10,739
- Berta, for God's sake!
- Hey, do you want clean towels?

29
00:02:10,847 --> 00:02:13,577
- But I'm trying to do something here.
- So do it.

30
00:02:13,684 --> 00:02:15,379
Well, I can't do it now.

31
00:02:20,023 --> 00:02:21,183
Is something wrong?

32
00:02:21,258 --> 00:02:24,227
I mean, beyond the usual
demeaning-job hellish-life stuff?

33
00:02:24,294 --> 00:02:25,522
Do you really want to know?

34
00:02:26,029 --> 00:02:27,929
No, but I'm up and my bed's gone.

35
00:02:28,966 --> 00:02:31,992
Okay. So I told you
about my daughter, right?

36
00:02:32,102 --> 00:02:34,263
- You have a daughter?
- I have three.

37
00:02:34,404 --> 00:02:35,996
Three? Wow.

38
00:02:37,741 --> 00:02:39,800
You gotta start learning to say no,
little lady.

39
00:02:44,114 --> 00:02:45,411
Hey, Berta. Morning.

40
00:02:45,482 --> 00:02:49,418
Now, you know I hate to criticize,
but the coffee filters you've been buying

41
00:02:49,486 --> 00:02:50,578
have chemicals in them.

42
00:02:51,922 --> 00:02:53,685
And I love it!

43
00:02:54,925 --> 00:02:56,017
Get out of my way.

44
00:02:58,862 --> 00:03:02,457
- What's wrong with her?
- Apparently she has children.

45
00:03:04,301 --> 00:03:07,327
And one of them showed up last night
and left her little girl,

46
00:03:07,437 --> 00:03:09,302
who I have to drag with me everywhere

47
00:03:09,373 --> 00:03:11,432
because I can't leave her alone
in the house.

48
00:03:11,508 --> 00:03:13,169
- So you brought her here?
- Yeah.

49
00:03:13,276 --> 00:03:14,800
Is that gonna be a problem?

50
00:03:16,279 --> 00:03:17,610
- No.
- That's wonderful.

51
00:03:17,681 --> 00:03:19,444
- Happy to have her.
- Yeah.

52
00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:22,450
- So where is she?
- She's playing with Jake.

53
00:03:22,519 --> 00:03:24,111
Good. A little playmate for Jake.

54
00:03:24,187 --> 00:03:26,280
That'll give him something to do for today.

55
00:03:26,356 --> 00:03:28,824
I hope they're quiet
'cause I got a lot of work to do.

56
00:03:28,892 --> 00:03:31,622
Nana, did you throw out
my cigarettes again?

57
00:03:35,999 --> 00:03:37,523
- Dear God!
- Oh, hell!

58
00:03:39,336 --> 00:03:41,065
Prudence, you're 16 years old.

59
00:03:41,171 --> 00:03:44,800
You want to end up on a breathing
machine like your Uncle Chick?

60
00:03:44,875 --> 00:03:47,901
- Mom lets me smoke.
- Well, why didn't you say so?

61
00:03:48,011 --> 00:03:50,502
No reason I shouldn't trust
the judgment of a woman

62
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:54,539
who's off selling bootleg Metallica t-shirts
at a monster truck rally.

63
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:57,384
Mom sounds like a real go-getter.

64
00:03:57,821 --> 00:03:59,982
So what am I supposed to do here all day?

65
00:04:00,057 --> 00:04:02,685
You're supposed to help me clean,
that's what. Here.

66
00:04:02,759 --> 00:04:04,750
You can start with his toilet.

67
00:04:08,265 --> 00:04:09,357
Hi.

68
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:13,264
- I'm Alan.
- Hi, Alan.

69
00:04:14,938 --> 00:04:16,929
What kind of car do you drive?

70
00:04:17,574 --> 00:04:22,034
- A Volvo station wagon.
- What do you got?

71
00:04:24,081 --> 00:04:26,549
I got nothing. Not a damn thing.

72
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:29,944
Hey, Prudence, I set up my Xbox.
You ready to play?

73
00:04:30,053 --> 00:04:32,783
- Sure.
- Get to work, Prudence!

74
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:37,287
Maybe later, handsome.
Stupid old woman.

75
00:04:39,463 --> 00:04:41,294
Isn't she wonderful?

76
00:04:43,633 --> 00:04:45,100
- Dear God.
- Oh, hell.

77
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:03,142
Well, I'd better get started on that work

78
00:05:07,357 --> 00:05:10,588
I have... to do.

79
00:05:12,963 --> 00:05:16,626
Yeah, I gotta catch up on some
paperwork that

80
00:05:17,167 --> 00:05:20,193
has to do with the office.

81
00:05:25,008 --> 00:05:27,101
- Oh, yeah. Your job.
- Yeah.

82
00:05:31,348 --> 00:05:32,713
Your chiropractor job.

83
00:05:34,017 --> 00:05:37,145
Yeah and you'll be, what,
you'll be writing a jingle?

84
00:05:40,323 --> 00:05:44,487
Yeah. Potato chips. You know, the...

85
00:05:45,729 --> 00:05:47,287
The ones in the can.

86
00:05:48,298 --> 00:05:49,492
Yeah.

87
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,324
I like those.

88
00:06:01,711 --> 00:06:03,076
All right, then.

89
00:06:05,482 --> 00:06:09,919
- I'm gonna go over to the piano now.
- Yeah, and I'm gonna go to the

90
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:13,878
kitchen and... Yeah.

91
00:06:32,943 --> 00:06:34,808
Hey, you play piano?

92
00:06:39,382 --> 00:06:40,474
Yes.

93
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:51,893
You're pretty good.

94
00:06:53,964 --> 00:06:55,056
Thanks.

95
00:06:55,165 --> 00:06:58,794
- Are you in a band?
- No.

96
00:06:59,669 --> 00:07:03,332
I used to go out with a bass player.
He wrote this beautiful song for me,

97
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,931
called Dear Prudence.

98
00:07:08,778 --> 00:07:11,975
Yeah, that sounds like something
a bass player would do.

99
00:07:12,916 --> 00:07:15,646
You know, I've always wanted
to play the piano.

100
00:07:16,419 --> 00:07:18,944
Do you think you could
teach me something?

101
00:07:21,091 --> 00:07:23,150
Nope, nothing, not a damn thing.

102
00:07:25,929 --> 00:07:29,330
So, do you have a girlfriend?

103
00:07:29,466 --> 00:07:31,991
Me? Oh, yeah. Big-time girlfriend.

104
00:07:32,535 --> 00:07:34,366
We're practically engaged.

105
00:07:34,604 --> 00:07:36,970
Prudence, he's old enough
to be your father.

106
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:39,008
And knowing your mother, he might be.

107
00:07:40,877 --> 00:07:45,541
- Just wash the damn windows.
- I'm not your father.

108
00:07:48,485 --> 00:07:51,010
How do you stand her? She's such a bitch.

109
00:07:51,354 --> 00:07:54,152
Don't talk like that
about your grandmother.

110
00:07:54,224 --> 00:07:57,819
Hey, you don't know her.
She's all sweet and nice with you.

111
00:07:58,862 --> 00:07:59,886
Yeah.

112
00:08:01,197 --> 00:08:02,789
She's a real gumdrop.

113
00:08:04,367 --> 00:08:08,167
My point is, you've gotta respect her
because she loves you and

114
00:08:09,539 --> 00:08:12,474
I've seen her pick up the stove
to vacuum under it.

115
00:08:14,811 --> 00:08:16,301
Oh, hey, look!

116
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:18,811
There's Rose, my girlfriend.

117
00:08:21,051 --> 00:08:22,484
Come on in, baby.

118
00:08:24,587 --> 00:08:25,645
Okay.

119
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:31,720
Rose, this is Berta's 16-year-old
granddaughter, Prudence.

120
00:08:32,162 --> 00:08:36,565
Prudence, this is my girlfriend, who
I'm free to take across state lines, Rose.

121
00:08:45,175 --> 00:08:47,507
- Wow, look at that kiss!
- What?

122
00:08:48,545 --> 00:08:50,570
Oh, thank God.

123
00:08:52,015 --> 00:08:54,176
Berta, does Prudence have a boyfriend?

124
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:56,241
Oh, honey, don't get me started.

125
00:08:56,353 --> 00:08:57,547
What does that mean?

126
00:08:57,654 --> 00:09:00,919
It means if she gets a high-school diploma
before she gets a baby,

127
00:09:01,024 --> 00:09:03,151
she'll be the first one in the family.

128
00:09:05,362 --> 00:09:07,353
I'm thirsty. What's to drink?

129
00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:10,331
The Cransylvania Goofy Juice is mine,
but you can have one.

130
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:12,197
Oh, thanks, handsome.

131
00:09:12,268 --> 00:09:13,667
Is this beer for anybody?

132
00:09:13,737 --> 00:09:17,673
- Prudence, you're 16.
- You know, Prudence,

133
00:09:17,741 --> 00:09:20,938
the Goofy Juice has vitamin C
and calcium.

134
00:09:21,044 --> 00:09:24,172
It's much better than beer
for a growing body.

135
00:09:25,915 --> 00:09:29,043
Not that your body needs to grow.

136
00:09:32,856 --> 00:09:34,016
I'm done.

137
00:09:35,925 --> 00:09:38,723
You know, Prudence,
I'm the third fastest runner in my class.

138
00:09:39,028 --> 00:09:41,929
- Cool!
- Spring break's over. Back to work.

139
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:43,593
Later, stud.

140
00:09:44,868 --> 00:09:47,200
Boy, she smells good.

141
00:09:48,071 --> 00:09:50,801
Yeah, if you like Camel Filters
and pheromones.

142
00:09:51,875 --> 00:09:54,400
I gotta do some grocery shopping
for your brother.

143
00:09:54,477 --> 00:09:56,468
I'll be back in a little while.

144
00:09:56,579 --> 00:09:58,444
- What about Prudence?
- She'll be fine.

145
00:09:58,548 --> 00:10:00,413
Just keep her out of the liquor cabinet.

146
00:10:00,483 --> 00:10:02,576
Don't do anything stupid
or you'll go to jail.

147
00:10:05,054 --> 00:10:08,546
- Why would you go to jail?
- Well, that's kind of complicated.

148
00:10:08,625 --> 00:10:10,752
And why was Uncle Charlie kissing Rose?

149
00:10:10,827 --> 00:10:13,990
- Well, that was the...
- And what are pherobones?

150
00:10:14,097 --> 00:10:17,089
That one I know,
and it's pronounced pheromones...

151
00:10:18,935 --> 00:10:20,129
Never mind.

152
00:10:30,214 --> 00:10:33,081
Wow, you're really good at that.

153
00:10:35,185 --> 00:10:38,086
Thanks. I took some cosmetology courses.

154
00:10:38,188 --> 00:10:41,749
I figure I'll be a beautician,
or a supermodel.

155
00:10:43,493 --> 00:10:44,653
Cool.

156
00:10:46,063 --> 00:10:49,430
- You want another Goofy Juice?
- Aren't you the sweetest.

157
00:10:57,674 --> 00:10:59,574
That's twice he's done that.

158
00:10:59,710 --> 00:11:02,736
You gotta admit,
she did a nice job on those windows.

159
00:11:08,418 --> 00:11:11,080
Jake, you need to get started
on that book report.

160
00:11:11,188 --> 00:11:14,180
- But Prudence is thirsty.
- I'll take care of Prudence.

161
00:11:14,258 --> 00:11:16,351
- Come on, get going.
- Man!

162
00:11:17,861 --> 00:11:20,261
- Charlie, you want to...
- Not a chance in hell.

163
00:11:22,633 --> 00:11:25,625
Remember when you used to say that
about us?

164
00:11:41,718 --> 00:11:44,881
- Here.
- Thanks.

165
00:11:45,622 --> 00:11:46,953
Where's my little pal?

166
00:11:47,057 --> 00:11:51,551
- He has work to do. Kind of like you.
- Are you gonna tell on me?

167
00:11:53,597 --> 00:11:55,428
No, it was just...

168
00:11:56,733 --> 00:11:58,826
Just an observation.

169
00:11:58,936 --> 00:12:01,666
Just calling them as I see them.

170
00:12:04,741 --> 00:12:06,641
Glean from it what you will.

171
00:12:08,145 --> 00:12:11,945
- What are you talking about?
- I'm not really sure anymore.

172
00:12:13,984 --> 00:12:16,680
But I do want you to know that

173
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:20,512
I understand how angry
and powerless you feel.

174
00:12:20,958 --> 00:12:23,085
Believe it or not,
I was a teenager once, too.

175
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:28,288
And I can remember what it's like
to rebel against parental authority.

176
00:12:28,365 --> 00:12:31,596
Or in your case, grandparental authority.

177
00:12:32,836 --> 00:12:35,031
- Can you put some of this on my back?
- No.

178
00:12:37,341 --> 00:12:39,172
If you don't, I'll burn.

179
00:12:39,276 --> 00:12:40,868
If I do, I will.

180
00:12:46,683 --> 00:12:50,847
- Judith. What a surprise.
- Hello, Charlie.

181
00:12:53,991 --> 00:12:55,151
So,

182
00:12:56,893 --> 00:12:59,521
- what's new?
- Where's Jake?

183
00:12:59,629 --> 00:13:01,722
In his room, doing a book report.

184
00:13:01,832 --> 00:13:05,131
Well, how can he do a book report
when he left the book at my house?

185
00:13:05,202 --> 00:13:09,366
That little dickens.
Trying to pull the wool over our eyes.

186
00:13:09,473 --> 00:13:14,467
- I'll take care of this right now. Bye.
- Charlie, I want to see Jake.

187
00:13:15,412 --> 00:13:16,902
Sure. Hang on.

188
00:13:18,982 --> 00:13:22,145
Jake? Your mother's here!

189
00:13:33,497 --> 00:13:37,331
- What?
- Your mom's here. Talk to your mom.

190
00:13:39,002 --> 00:13:40,560
- Here he is.
- Hi, Mom.

191
00:13:40,670 --> 00:13:43,195
Hi, sweetie.
Are you having a fun weekend?

192
00:13:43,273 --> 00:13:45,366
You know Berta,
Uncle Charlie's housekeeper...

193
00:13:45,442 --> 00:13:48,275
Of course she knows her.
Who doesn't know Berta?

194
00:13:48,378 --> 00:13:51,506
- She brought her granddaughter over.
- Yeah. Sweet little kid.

195
00:13:51,581 --> 00:13:53,549
That's nice.
Have you been playing with her?

196
00:13:53,617 --> 00:13:56,950
Oh, yeah. I mean, he has. Not me.

197
00:13:58,622 --> 00:14:00,351
Hey, Judith. What's up?

198
00:14:01,425 --> 00:14:05,589
Well, it turns out this little rascal
was pulling a fast one on us.

199
00:14:05,829 --> 00:14:08,161
Doing a book report without the book.

200
00:14:09,332 --> 00:14:13,393
Oh, Jake. All right, young man,
you get to work right now.

201
00:14:16,239 --> 00:14:19,504
- Jake?
- Oh, yeah.

202
00:14:21,445 --> 00:14:23,276
So, thanks for stopping by.

203
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:26,008
I guess I'll see you
when you come to pick him up.

204
00:14:26,083 --> 00:14:28,574
- What's going on here?
- Nothing. What?

205
00:14:29,686 --> 00:14:31,119
Oh, hi, Judith.

206
00:14:31,221 --> 00:14:34,884
Did you hear the good news?
Charlie and I are back together.

207
00:14:35,125 --> 00:14:36,558
Oh, really?

208
00:14:37,627 --> 00:14:39,788
Yep. That's what's going on here.

209
00:14:40,363 --> 00:14:43,594
Well, just show a little discretion
in front of my son, Charlie.

210
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:44,860
Absolutely.

211
00:14:44,935 --> 00:14:48,029
- You got that, Rose? Discretion.
- Got it, Monkey Man.

212
00:14:56,046 --> 00:14:58,480
I think I have a concussion.

213
00:15:04,488 --> 00:15:07,252
Thanks for helping me
with my book report, Prudence.

214
00:15:07,324 --> 00:15:10,259
Oh, no problem.
Fourth-grade stuff is easy for me.

215
00:15:11,294 --> 00:15:13,558
Should be, you did it twice.

216
00:15:14,331 --> 00:15:16,265
Let's go before we miss the bus.

217
00:15:16,333 --> 00:15:18,801
- Later, handsome.
- Bye.

218
00:15:25,408 --> 00:15:27,808
So, what are we doing tonight, sweetie?

219
00:15:31,014 --> 00:15:33,312
Rose, I really appreciate your help,

220
00:15:33,450 --> 00:15:36,442
but you don't have to pretend
to be my girlfriend anymore.

221
00:15:38,121 --> 00:15:39,349
Oh, no.

222
00:15:40,290 --> 00:15:43,088
Are you pretending to break up with me?

223
00:15:53,670 --> 00:15:56,537
2:00 in the morning. This better be God.

224
00:15:59,609 --> 00:16:00,769
Oh, God.

225
00:16:02,646 --> 00:16:03,840
Hey.

226
00:16:03,947 --> 00:16:06,507
Prudence, what the hell
are you doing here?

227
00:16:06,616 --> 00:16:09,449
- I had a fight with my grandmother.
- So?

228
00:16:09,653 --> 00:16:13,145
When I have a fight with my grandmother,
I don't come to your house.

229
00:16:13,456 --> 00:16:15,981
I know, I'm sorry.
I just didn't know where else to go

230
00:16:16,059 --> 00:16:18,323
and I thought you were cool.

231
00:16:19,229 --> 00:16:23,632
Look, Prudence, this just can't happen.

232
00:16:24,201 --> 00:16:28,137
I mean, you're very nice and pretty,
but in prison, so am I.

233
00:16:30,173 --> 00:16:32,903
Bitching house, man.
You should rent it to MTV.

234
00:16:34,978 --> 00:16:37,708
- Who the hell are you?
- What's going on?

235
00:16:39,516 --> 00:16:43,577
Put down the toothbrush, Alan,
we've got bigger problems than gingivitis.

236
00:16:44,387 --> 00:16:46,753
What's she doing here?
Who the hell is this?

237
00:16:46,856 --> 00:16:49,916
This is Freddie. My fiancé.

238
00:16:51,561 --> 00:16:53,654
- 'Sup.
- 'Sup?

239
00:16:53,730 --> 00:16:55,322
I'll tell you what's 'sup. I'm 'sup.

240
00:16:55,398 --> 00:16:57,263
And I should be seeping. Sleeping.

241
00:16:57,367 --> 00:16:58,925
What's going on here?

242
00:16:59,402 --> 00:17:03,031
Well, Freddie came over to announce
our engagement, and Nana threw him out.

243
00:17:03,106 --> 00:17:06,166
Really? She didn't take a shine
to Bazooka Joe here?

244
00:17:07,077 --> 00:17:09,910
You know,
I'm kind of more of an acquired taste.

245
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:12,544
So we just need a place to crash tonight

246
00:17:12,616 --> 00:17:15,278
because tomorrow we're gonna go
to Vegas and get married.

247
00:17:15,385 --> 00:17:17,910
- Oh, Prudence, that's a terrible idea.
- Yeah.

248
00:17:18,021 --> 00:17:20,615
If you leave right now,
you can beat the traffic.

249
00:17:21,458 --> 00:17:22,755
We can't go tonight.

250
00:17:22,859 --> 00:17:25,555
He's gotta pick up his last paycheck
from the photomat.

251
00:17:25,629 --> 00:17:28,063
Yeah, $218.

252
00:17:28,131 --> 00:17:30,599
I'll give you $300 to leave right now.

253
00:17:31,635 --> 00:17:34,365
- Charlie, we can't let them go.
- Why not?

254
00:17:34,437 --> 00:17:36,632
Because they're stupid and they'll die.

255
00:17:37,707 --> 00:17:40,471
- What's going on?
- Hey, handsome.

256
00:17:41,444 --> 00:17:44,140
- Who's he?
- This is Freddie, my fiancé.

257
00:17:44,247 --> 00:17:48,581
- You're marrying him?
- Freddie, this is Jake.

258
00:17:50,353 --> 00:17:51,581
'Sup.

259
00:17:54,124 --> 00:17:57,093
Charlie, I saw the lights come on,
is everything okay?

260
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:59,128
Yeah, Rose, everything's fine.

261
00:17:59,596 --> 00:18:02,463
She's your girlfriend
but she doesn't sleep here?

262
00:18:02,666 --> 00:18:04,896
Yeah, what's up with that, Charlie?

263
00:18:06,770 --> 00:18:09,933
- I told you they'd be here.
- Come here, you little snot bubble.

264
00:18:10,006 --> 00:18:12,304
What do you think you're doing
with my baby girl?

265
00:18:12,409 --> 00:18:13,899
Mom, leave him alone! I love him.

266
00:18:13,977 --> 00:18:16,502
Give me a break, Prudence.
You're 16 years old,

267
00:18:16,613 --> 00:18:19,776
and your hormones are doing
all your thinking for you.

268
00:18:19,849 --> 00:18:21,282
Hi, you must be Charlie.

269
00:18:22,619 --> 00:18:23,643
Hi.

270
00:18:23,753 --> 00:18:25,983
- That's it, we're outta here.
- But, Mom...

271
00:18:26,089 --> 00:18:27,579
- Grandma!
- Oh, shut up, both of you!

272
00:18:27,657 --> 00:18:31,286
- Can I at least give him my number?
- He's got your number, sweetheart.

273
00:18:36,433 --> 00:18:38,094
I guess I'll take the couch.

274
00:18:38,168 --> 00:18:39,760
Okay, I'm going!

275
00:18:40,136 --> 00:18:41,831
Don't you ever come back!

276
00:18:43,139 --> 00:18:45,107
Ready for bed, lamb chop?

277
00:18:47,143 --> 00:18:48,974
It was worth a shot.

278
00:18:54,784 --> 00:18:56,479
- Is Mom here yet?
- No.

279
00:18:56,886 --> 00:19:00,378
- Sit down a minute, Jake, okay?
- Did I do something wrong?

280
00:19:00,490 --> 00:19:01,957
No.

281
00:19:02,025 --> 00:19:06,553
- We just want to talk.
- Okay. What do you want to talk about?

282
00:19:07,030 --> 00:19:10,466
Well, you know how I've always told
you that you should always tell

283
00:19:10,533 --> 00:19:13,195
your parents the truth, no matter what?

284
00:19:13,737 --> 00:19:15,398
Well, forget it.

285
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:19,904
Charlie. Jake, it's just that...

286
00:19:20,043 --> 00:19:23,171
We're just saying a lot of things
happened here this weekend,

287
00:19:23,246 --> 00:19:27,012
and it's not really necessary
that your mother know about them.

288
00:19:27,317 --> 00:19:28,750
So you want me to lie?

289
00:19:28,852 --> 00:19:31,082
No, it's not really lying.

290
00:19:33,556 --> 00:19:35,922
When a boy becomes a man,

291
00:19:37,861 --> 00:19:39,920
and that's what you're becoming.

292
00:19:40,230 --> 00:19:42,721
- Right, Charlie?
- Oh, yeah, a man.

293
00:19:44,901 --> 00:19:48,735
He has to start protecting the women
in his life from certain things.

294
00:19:48,838 --> 00:19:49,896
Like the truth.

295
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:52,273
Do you understand?

296
00:19:52,375 --> 00:19:55,173
I think so.
You don't want Mom to know about

297
00:19:55,245 --> 00:19:57,179
Prudence and her boyfriend
and everything.

298
00:19:58,448 --> 00:19:59,779
Good man.

299
00:20:05,522 --> 00:20:07,251
- Hi, Judith.
- Hello, Alan.

300
00:20:07,390 --> 00:20:08,618
- Charlie.
- Judith.

301
00:20:08,725 --> 00:20:10,215
- You ready to go, sweetheart?
- Yep.

302
00:20:10,293 --> 00:20:11,760
How was your weekend?

303
00:20:11,861 --> 00:20:14,227
Uncle Charlie says I don't have to tell you.

304
00:20:48,331 --> 00:20:49,525
English
