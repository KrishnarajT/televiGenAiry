1
00:00:14,445 --> 00:00:15,605
Alan?

2
00:00:19,917 --> 00:00:21,111
Alan, what are you doing?

3
00:00:21,218 --> 00:00:23,311
There are dust bunnies everywhere!

4
00:00:27,458 --> 00:00:29,323
So you're vacuuming dust bunnies?

5
00:00:29,427 --> 00:00:32,328
No. Their poop. It's all over the place.

6
00:00:36,133 --> 00:00:37,760
Are you sleepwalking?

7
00:00:37,835 --> 00:00:40,303
You're stepping in it! Don't step in it!

8
00:00:44,775 --> 00:00:48,836
Alan, why don't we leave
the dust bunny poop until morning?

9
00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:54,640
- Click.
- Hey!

10
00:00:58,756 --> 00:01:03,250
Come on. Let's get you tucked in,
you crazy son of a bitch.

11
00:01:15,272 --> 00:01:18,366
- What?
- You know.

12
00:01:22,513 --> 00:01:25,380
Okay, that's it, into bed. Nighty-night.

13
00:01:25,483 --> 00:01:27,951
If you feel the need to get up
and clean something,

14
00:01:28,018 --> 00:01:30,111
maybe you can wax my car.

15
00:01:33,124 --> 00:01:35,024
For God's sake, Rose!

16
00:01:35,559 --> 00:01:37,857
Isn't there enough poop
on the carpet tonight?

17
00:01:38,462 --> 00:01:39,827
What are you doing here?

18
00:01:39,897 --> 00:01:42,798
I'm sorry. I saw your lights come on
and I was worried.

19
00:01:42,867 --> 00:01:46,303
Why were you looking at my house
at 3:00 in the morning?

20
00:01:47,238 --> 00:01:50,173
Haven't you heard
of the Neighborhood Watch?

21
00:01:50,241 --> 00:01:53,233
- We don't have a Neighborhood Watch.
- Well, not yet.

22
00:01:53,344 --> 00:01:56,643
If we did, I surely couldn't stroll in here
like I just did.

23
00:01:58,349 --> 00:01:59,509
Yeah.

24
00:02:00,417 --> 00:02:03,853
- So, what's going on?
- Nothing. Alan was sleepwalking.

25
00:02:04,421 --> 00:02:08,016
- At least, I hope that was sleepwalking.
- Sure.

26
00:02:08,225 --> 00:02:10,489
My parents used to put
a football helmet on me

27
00:02:10,561 --> 00:02:13,189
- and strap me in bed.
- You were a sleepwalker?

28
00:02:13,497 --> 00:02:14,623
No.

29
00:02:16,534 --> 00:02:19,332
- Good night, Rose.
- Good night, Charlie.

30
00:02:20,805 --> 00:02:23,330
Thank you, I had a wonderful time.

31
00:02:30,714 --> 00:02:35,674
If crazy ever becomes an Olympic event,
I get the first two legs of the relay.

32
00:02:42,526 --> 00:02:45,757
- What?
- Nothing.

33
00:02:47,865 --> 00:02:50,265
Man, I'm living in a loony bin.

34
00:02:59,377 --> 00:03:02,642
Judith, I don't care what
all the other divorced parents are doing.

35
00:03:02,713 --> 00:03:06,479
I don't think Jake needs
to keep seeing the psychologist.

36
00:03:06,717 --> 00:03:08,708
No, I am not in denial.

37
00:03:11,923 --> 00:03:15,154
Judith, denying you're in denial
is not denial.

38
00:03:17,195 --> 00:03:19,186
Okay, this is how it's going to be.

39
00:03:19,263 --> 00:03:22,198
I will have Jake
at the psychologist's office at 11:00.

40
00:03:22,266 --> 00:03:23,893
You're welcome.

41
00:03:24,001 --> 00:03:25,093
Damn it!

42
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:27,661
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

43
00:03:27,772 --> 00:03:28,898
Were you talking to Mom?

44
00:03:29,006 --> 00:03:31,236
Yes, but I hung up
before I said the bad stuff.

45
00:03:31,342 --> 00:03:33,606
Yeah, she does the same thing with you.

46
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:39,349
- Hey.
- Morning. Why is the vacuum cleaner out?

47
00:03:43,387 --> 00:03:46,288
Because we were ankle deep
in bunny poop.

48
00:03:49,193 --> 00:03:52,754
- Were you drinking last night?
- Yes, but that's not the point.

49
00:03:53,931 --> 00:03:57,731
- You were sleepwalking.
- Really? I have no memory of being up.

50
00:03:57,802 --> 00:04:01,431
Good for you, because I have no memory
of being asleep.

51
00:04:01,806 --> 00:04:04,536
I'm sorry, I haven't done that
since I was a kid.

52
00:04:04,809 --> 00:04:06,572
Yeah, well, if you're gonna regress,

53
00:04:06,644 --> 00:04:09,477
let me know,
so I can stock up on rubber sheets.

54
00:04:10,147 --> 00:04:12,445
Okay, that was uncalled for!

55
00:04:12,717 --> 00:04:16,084
You want to go to the bowling alley
and play some air hockey today?

56
00:04:16,153 --> 00:04:19,816
Sure, but you still owe me
like $12,000 from last time.

57
00:04:20,558 --> 00:04:22,651
What are you gonna do, break my thumbs?

58
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:24,819
Wouldn't hurt your game.

59
00:04:25,796 --> 00:04:28,390
Remember, we have Jake's session first.

60
00:04:28,466 --> 00:04:31,435
Man! I thought you didn't want him
to go back to that quack.

61
00:04:31,502 --> 00:04:33,902
I didn't, but Judith and I talked,

62
00:04:33,971 --> 00:04:37,338
and we decided that what I want
makes no difference whatsoever.

63
00:04:39,277 --> 00:04:40,801
Man, you are so whipped.

64
00:04:40,912 --> 00:04:43,972
I am not whipped!
I'm just trying to keep everybody happy.

65
00:04:44,081 --> 00:04:48,142
- Meow. Fit-choo!
- I am not "meow-fitchooed. "

66
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:52,756
You're right. It's been a long time
since you got any meow.

67
00:04:56,961 --> 00:04:58,826
Are we getting a cat?

68
00:05:01,699 --> 00:05:04,668
You know, this is a waste of time.
Jake's a normal kid.

69
00:05:04,769 --> 00:05:08,466
But it's not gonna hurt to have someone
outside the family he can talk to.

70
00:05:08,539 --> 00:05:11,997
Please. He's just sitting in there
making stuff up.

71
00:05:13,210 --> 00:05:15,701
- What?
- Well, not really making it up.

72
00:05:15,813 --> 00:05:18,509
He and I work out his schtick beforehand.

73
00:05:21,652 --> 00:05:24,678
Today he's telling her
he sees dead people.

74
00:05:27,358 --> 00:05:30,054
Charlie, I am paying this woman
a lot of money.

75
00:05:30,161 --> 00:05:32,356
Bet you feel pretty stupid, huh?

76
00:05:33,631 --> 00:05:34,791
What do you want me to do?

77
00:05:34,865 --> 00:05:37,834
Judith is insisting
he comes here once a week.

78
00:05:37,902 --> 00:05:42,498
Okay, look, nobody likes divorce,
but there are certain advantages.

79
00:05:42,807 --> 00:05:44,172
One of the more popular ones

80
00:05:44,241 --> 00:05:47,301
is you get to tell your ex-wife
to bite the big one!

81
00:05:48,145 --> 00:05:50,943
- Or whatever you got left.
- Yeah.

82
00:05:51,349 --> 00:05:54,113
That'll help.
Look, it's just an hour out of our day.

83
00:05:54,218 --> 00:05:57,517
Which could've been spent on air hockey
and bowling alley martinis.

84
00:05:57,588 --> 00:06:00,716
It's a small price to pay
to avoid aggravating Judith.

85
00:06:00,791 --> 00:06:03,225
- Okay. I understand.
- Thank you.

86
00:06:03,894 --> 00:06:05,623
You're a big girl.

87
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:10,127
Okay. Are there any out here?

88
00:06:15,606 --> 00:06:17,699
- No.
- Good.

89
00:06:18,476 --> 00:06:20,740
We'll see you next Saturday.

90
00:06:23,714 --> 00:06:26,478
Doctor, you should know,
he doesn't really see dead people.

91
00:06:26,584 --> 00:06:28,609
Of course not. He's just trying to resolve

92
00:06:28,719 --> 00:06:30,653
emotional issues
through visualized fantasy.

93
00:06:30,755 --> 00:06:32,620
Do you have my check?

94
00:06:34,659 --> 00:06:37,890
Dad, how come we never got spare ribs
when we were at Mom's house?

95
00:06:37,962 --> 00:06:40,726
Because your mom thinks
they're too fatty.

96
00:06:40,798 --> 00:06:42,231
Fit-choo!

97
00:06:44,301 --> 00:06:47,930
- Is that really necessary?
- Hey, if the fit-choo fits.

98
00:06:49,173 --> 00:06:50,504
Fit-choo!

99
00:06:54,178 --> 00:06:55,736
Are you happy?

100
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:59,177
- Come on, he doesn't know what it means.
- Fine.

101
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:02,017
Anybody see the pancakes
for the moo-shu chicken?

102
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:05,947
No, looks like they forgot them.
Just eat it with a fork.

103
00:07:06,190 --> 00:07:07,817
You don't eat moo-shu with a fork.

104
00:07:07,925 --> 00:07:10,917
You eat moo-shu with a pancake,
like a little Chinese taco.

105
00:07:11,295 --> 00:07:14,787
- Okay, all right. You want a taco shell?
- No, I don't want a taco shell!

106
00:07:14,865 --> 00:07:19,700
I want a pancake for my moo-shu.
I ordered pancakes. I paid for pancakes.

107
00:07:20,271 --> 00:07:22,296
Where the hell are my pancakes?

108
00:07:22,373 --> 00:07:25,809
- Alan, chill.
- I will not chill. I want what I ordered.

109
00:07:25,876 --> 00:07:29,004
And for once in my life,
I will get what was promised me!

110
00:07:29,113 --> 00:07:30,512
Fit-choo.

111
00:07:35,119 --> 00:07:36,882
See? Not a clue.

112
00:07:38,956 --> 00:07:42,050
I am gonna call that restaurant
and give them a piece of my mind.

113
00:07:42,159 --> 00:07:44,992
That's smart. Scream at the people
who handle your food.

114
00:07:45,896 --> 00:07:47,625
- Is he okay?
- Yeah.

115
00:07:47,698 --> 00:07:50,064
Maybe a little tired.
Just been working pretty hard.

116
00:07:50,167 --> 00:07:52,567
You know, my second grade teacher,
Miss Spulvaney?

117
00:07:52,670 --> 00:07:55,002
One time she got mad
'cause there was no chalk,

118
00:07:55,072 --> 00:07:58,508
and they found her in the cafeteria
hiding under a lunch table.

119
00:07:58,576 --> 00:08:01,238
- No kidding.
- Yeah, she went berserk.

120
00:08:03,981 --> 00:08:06,381
That's how we got Miss McKinnon.

121
00:08:20,898 --> 00:08:23,890
- Hi.
- Rose?

122
00:08:24,902 --> 00:08:27,200
How do you keep getting in the house?

123
00:08:27,938 --> 00:08:30,270
Charlie, aren't we past that?

124
00:08:31,075 --> 00:08:34,408
I thought you'd like to know
that your brother is sleepwalking again.

125
00:08:34,512 --> 00:08:37,572
And you had to get in bed with me
to tell me that?

126
00:08:37,915 --> 00:08:41,043
No, silly. I was already in bed with you.

127
00:08:43,053 --> 00:08:46,022
I just heard him
walking around downstairs.

128
00:08:59,136 --> 00:09:00,330
Alan?

129
00:09:01,772 --> 00:09:04,900
- What are you doing?
- Making a birthday cake.

130
00:09:05,009 --> 00:09:06,977
You and Mom want some?

131
00:09:08,145 --> 00:09:11,308
You handle this, honey,
I'm going back to bed.

132
00:09:19,738 --> 00:09:22,673
- Jake, your grandmother's here.
- Oh, man.

133
00:09:23,408 --> 00:09:25,808
I mean, right here in the room.

134
00:09:26,912 --> 00:09:29,039
Oh, man, Grandma's here!

135
00:09:30,348 --> 00:09:32,839
- I blame you.
- Take a number.

136
00:09:35,186 --> 00:09:37,347
How could we be out of eggs?

137
00:09:37,555 --> 00:09:42,185
"Dr. Linda Freeman, Child Psychologist?"
Who here's seeing a child psychologist?

138
00:09:44,095 --> 00:09:45,323
Jake.

139
00:09:45,897 --> 00:09:50,334
His mom was concerned about, you know,
the impact of the divorce and everything.

140
00:09:50,402 --> 00:09:53,599
- On who?
- On Jake.

141
00:09:55,206 --> 00:09:58,369
I'll be right back.
I'm gonna go get some eggs.

142
00:09:58,443 --> 00:10:02,880
Jake, honey. I just want you to know

143
00:10:03,181 --> 00:10:06,446
that seeing a therapist
is no reflection on you.

144
00:10:06,685 --> 00:10:09,518
- Okay.
- It's a reflection on your parents.

145
00:10:10,188 --> 00:10:12,349
Particularly your mother.

146
00:10:13,725 --> 00:10:16,057
I think we're gonna get a cat.

147
00:10:17,629 --> 00:10:21,463
- The queen of darkness is here.
- Thanks for the heads-up.

148
00:10:22,033 --> 00:10:24,297
- Where you going?
- We're out of eggs.

149
00:10:25,537 --> 00:10:27,198
And you have no idea why?

150
00:10:27,272 --> 00:10:30,537
Well, Charlie, I would assume
somebody ate them.

151
00:10:33,645 --> 00:10:35,738
Okay, let's go with that.

152
00:10:36,715 --> 00:10:41,448
And then I tried Freudian analysis,
but with them, you know, it's just sex.

153
00:10:43,221 --> 00:10:46,952
- My doctor has a cow puppet.
- Really?

154
00:10:47,926 --> 00:10:51,657
- M.D. Or PhD?
- C-O-W.

155
00:10:54,566 --> 00:10:58,229
- Hey, Ma. Can I talk to you for a minute?
- I'll be right there.

156
00:10:58,737 --> 00:11:03,106
Now, honey, the cow puppet doesn't need
to know about the time

157
00:11:03,174 --> 00:11:06,041
you saw grandmommy dancing
with the Cuban gentleman

158
00:11:06,144 --> 00:11:08,772
in the Neiman Marcus changing room.

159
00:11:10,382 --> 00:11:12,282
What is it, Charlie?

160
00:11:12,384 --> 00:11:16,377
I need to talk to you about Alan.
He's been acting really strange lately.

161
00:11:16,488 --> 00:11:18,786
And I suppose it's my fault.

162
00:11:19,224 --> 00:11:21,988
No. Well, maybe.

163
00:11:23,828 --> 00:11:26,058
The thing is, he's been sleepwalking,

164
00:11:26,164 --> 00:11:28,189
and I remember him
doing it when he was a kid.

165
00:11:28,299 --> 00:11:31,291
Yes. It was shortly after
your father passed away.

166
00:11:31,369 --> 00:11:34,827
- What'd you do about it?
- Well, nothing really.

167
00:11:35,006 --> 00:11:38,305
It seemed to stop by itself
when he was 13.

168
00:11:38,510 --> 00:11:42,674
Right around the time
he started taking those long showers

169
00:11:45,083 --> 00:11:48,644
and relieving his anxiety
in a more direct way.

170
00:11:50,255 --> 00:11:53,656
Got it. So, sexual release
cured his sleepwalking?

171
00:11:53,758 --> 00:11:58,218
Seemed to. Of course, there was
a brief time when the two overlapped.

172
00:12:01,099 --> 00:12:05,195
I recall an incredibly
awkward bridge game.

173
00:12:05,437 --> 00:12:07,337
Okay, great. Thanks.

174
00:12:07,739 --> 00:12:10,902
I had Seven No Trump
and he just walked in

175
00:12:11,009 --> 00:12:13,273
with this goofy smile on his face.

176
00:12:14,012 --> 00:12:16,572
This is nice. Great idea, Charlie.

177
00:12:17,549 --> 00:12:20,450
I figure you work all week,
you got your kid on the weekends.

178
00:12:20,552 --> 00:12:24,545
I bet you hardly even have the time
to take a nice long soapy shower.

179
00:12:26,057 --> 00:12:30,221
- Yeah, it has been a little hectic.
- Let me ask you something.

180
00:12:30,862 --> 00:12:33,456
When's the last time
you had sex with a girl?

181
00:12:34,132 --> 00:12:37,067
Or a melon? Or anything?

182
00:12:37,569 --> 00:12:41,027
- None of your business...
- That long?

183
00:12:42,807 --> 00:12:45,241
- Why do you care?
- I don't know.

184
00:12:45,643 --> 00:12:50,080
You just have that twitchy look of a guy
who's got one stuck in the chamber.

185
00:12:50,815 --> 00:12:52,612
I'm fine, Charlie.

186
00:12:53,118 --> 00:12:54,813
Yeah, sure, I'd like to meet somebody.

187
00:12:54,919 --> 00:12:57,217
But in the meantime,
I'm living a very full life.

188
00:12:57,288 --> 00:13:01,054
I have no complaints.
This table is really starting to piss me off.

189
00:13:01,126 --> 00:13:02,457
Just let it wobble.

190
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:05,620
You want beer in your lap?
'Cause I don't want beer on my lap.

191
00:13:07,599 --> 00:13:10,261
Hi, Charlie. Who's your cute friend?

192
00:13:13,338 --> 00:13:15,738
Just get up here, you jackass.

193
00:13:18,676 --> 00:13:21,440
Hi, Charlie. Who's your cute friend?

194
00:13:22,013 --> 00:13:24,811
Hi, Darlene. This is my brother, Alan.

195
00:13:25,016 --> 00:13:26,984
Come, please, join us.

196
00:13:28,286 --> 00:13:31,278
- Hi, Alan. This is my friend, Annette.
- Hi.

197
00:13:31,356 --> 00:13:33,847
- Hello.
- Hey, he is cute.

198
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:36,491
You are.

199
00:13:38,329 --> 00:13:42,789
You know, Alan, Annette is a seat-filler
for most of the major awards shows.

200
00:13:43,101 --> 00:13:46,537
- Is that so?
- Yeah, it's a big responsibility.

201
00:13:46,971 --> 00:13:49,997
'Cause when a celebrity
gets up to go the bathroom,

202
00:13:50,108 --> 00:13:52,542
they don't want to have
an empty seat on TV.

203
00:13:52,644 --> 00:13:54,043
Understandable.

204
00:13:54,145 --> 00:13:57,308
You know who pees a lot? Jeff Bridges.

205
00:14:00,685 --> 00:14:03,119
What do you say we leave
and go back to our place?

206
00:14:03,188 --> 00:14:05,850
- Okey-dokey.
- Wait, just hold it.

207
00:14:06,291 --> 00:14:09,727
- Everybody, sit down.
- I feel like I'm at work.

208
00:14:10,862 --> 00:14:13,126
- What is going on?
- Nothing.

209
00:14:13,198 --> 00:14:15,496
We met a couple of girls
who took a shine to us.

210
00:14:15,567 --> 00:14:18,730
- Just like that?
- Yes, Alan, just like that.

211
00:14:19,837 --> 00:14:23,967
- God, please tell me you did not pay them.
- Hey, I resent that.

212
00:14:24,676 --> 00:14:26,803
Not all seat-fillers hook.

213
00:14:30,048 --> 00:14:33,347
Well, it was very nice meeting you.
I'm leaving.

214
00:14:34,352 --> 00:14:36,513
Be right back. Keep drinking.

215
00:14:37,188 --> 00:14:39,486
- What is wrong with you?
- Me?

216
00:14:39,557 --> 00:14:41,491
There is nothing wrong with me.
I'm just...

217
00:14:41,559 --> 00:14:43,857
I'm not interested in being set up
with a woman

218
00:14:43,928 --> 00:14:46,761
whose idea of chit-chat
is celebrity pee-pee secrets.

219
00:14:46,864 --> 00:14:49,059
- How about the other one?
- No!

220
00:14:49,167 --> 00:14:52,568
You sure? 'Cause there's no way
you're banging her on your own.

221
00:14:52,670 --> 00:14:56,504
- Why is this so important to you?
- Are you kidding me?

222
00:14:56,574 --> 00:15:00,271
You've been acting nuttier
than rat crap in a pistachio factory.

223
00:15:00,511 --> 00:15:03,275
I figured if I could coax
your Johnson out of retirement,

224
00:15:03,381 --> 00:15:06,043
you'd stop making
invisible birthday cakes.

225
00:15:06,117 --> 00:15:09,609
- What?
- I can't say it more clearly than that, Alan.

226
00:15:14,926 --> 00:15:18,123
Are you happy?

227
00:15:20,898 --> 00:15:25,562
Anyway, I know you only deal with kids,
but I didn't know where else to take him.

228
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:31,067
This is ridiculous. I don't need to be here.

229
00:15:31,142 --> 00:15:35,272
I gave you a choice.
Take the long shower or talk to the doctor.

230
00:15:36,581 --> 00:15:37,605
Okay.

231
00:15:37,715 --> 00:15:41,378
Well, if I had to guess,
and that's pretty much all I do here,

232
00:15:43,721 --> 00:15:45,279
I would have to say that,

233
00:15:45,390 --> 00:15:48,291
based on his inappropriate outbursts
and sleepwalking,

234
00:15:48,393 --> 00:15:52,090
Alan is struggling with a great deal
of suppressed rage.

235
00:15:52,797 --> 00:15:54,992
Rage? No, I don't think so.

236
00:15:56,067 --> 00:15:59,161
Come on. Your wife threw you
out of your own house,

237
00:15:59,270 --> 00:16:01,670
she still runs your life, you're broke,

238
00:16:01,773 --> 00:16:04,139
and you only get to see your kid
two days a week,

239
00:16:04,242 --> 00:16:07,507
one of which you have to bring him
to this rug rat exorcist.

240
00:16:11,983 --> 00:16:13,450
No offense.

241
00:16:15,586 --> 00:16:16,780
Okay.

242
00:16:19,157 --> 00:16:22,320
Now, Alan, how do you feel
about what Charlie just shared?

243
00:16:22,427 --> 00:16:27,330
I think he's completely off base.
Yes, I get a little frustrated sometimes,

244
00:16:27,665 --> 00:16:32,193
and when Judith doesn't get her own way,
she just keeps coming at me

245
00:16:33,037 --> 00:16:35,801
and coming at me
like a frigging steamroller.

246
00:16:35,873 --> 00:16:39,775
- Crushing my spirit and my self-respect.
- That's very good.

247
00:16:39,844 --> 00:16:42,711
But on the other hand,
she's a very good mom to Jake.

248
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:46,714
Okay. I'll tell you what. Let's pretend

249
00:16:47,485 --> 00:16:50,886
that Judith is sitting in this chair.

250
00:16:52,357 --> 00:16:54,382
What would you tell her right now?

251
00:16:55,026 --> 00:16:58,291
Boy, I don't know. I feel a little silly
talking to an empty chair.

252
00:16:58,363 --> 00:17:00,388
Fair enough. Charlie, do you mind?

253
00:17:00,498 --> 00:17:02,693
- Do I mind what?
- Thank you.

254
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:13,177
Now, Alan, tell Judith how you really feel.

255
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:19,641
Well, Judith,

256
00:17:21,152 --> 00:17:24,918
I know you're working through
some of your own issues,

257
00:17:25,089 --> 00:17:30,186
- sexual and otherwise, and I support that.
- That's telling her, Alan.

258
00:17:31,596 --> 00:17:34,030
Charlie, remember, you're Judith.

259
00:17:34,699 --> 00:17:35,927
Sorry.

260
00:17:37,068 --> 00:17:39,161
That's telling me, Alan.

261
00:17:42,507 --> 00:17:44,907
Is this gonna take much longer?

262
00:17:45,710 --> 00:17:49,771
'Cause I have to get to a massage,
then a tennis lesson that he's paying for.

263
00:17:51,048 --> 00:17:55,246
- Tennis? Since when do you play tennis?
- I told you, but you never listen.

264
00:17:55,953 --> 00:17:59,047
He never listens.
Thank God his brother took him in.

265
00:17:59,791 --> 00:18:02,851
- Okay, I am warning you.
- You're warning me?

266
00:18:03,795 --> 00:18:06,958
Okay, Alan, how are you feeling right now?

267
00:18:07,398 --> 00:18:11,357
- Well, a little angry.
- Really? 'Cause you don't sound angry.

268
00:18:11,469 --> 00:18:13,460
Well, I am.

269
00:18:13,771 --> 00:18:16,797
I just don't see any reason
to make a big spectacle of myself.

270
00:18:16,908 --> 00:18:22,039
Yeah, you'd rather blow off a sure thing
who actually makes a living with her ass.

271
00:18:23,815 --> 00:18:26,579
Meaningless, loveless sex
is not the answer, Charlie.

272
00:18:26,651 --> 00:18:28,619
- Meow, fit-choo!
- Okay.

273
00:18:30,588 --> 00:18:32,215
I am really getting tired of that.

274
00:18:32,290 --> 00:18:35,748
Hey, you know what, Charlie?
I don't much care for that, either.

275
00:18:36,494 --> 00:18:38,621
If you like,
we can schedule another session

276
00:18:38,729 --> 00:18:40,924
to deal with your fear of vaginas.

277
00:18:44,669 --> 00:18:48,264
Now, Alan, the reason I asked you
if you were angry

278
00:18:48,339 --> 00:18:50,899
is because I have yet to see
any genuine expression

279
00:18:50,975 --> 00:18:54,274
of what are undoubtedly
some very powerful feelings.

280
00:18:54,345 --> 00:18:57,405
I'm sorry, but that's just the best I can do.

281
00:18:57,482 --> 00:18:59,450
Okay, well, let's try something else.

282
00:18:59,517 --> 00:19:03,078
This is called a bataca.

283
00:19:03,488 --> 00:19:06,480
It's heavily padded, it can't hurt anyone,

284
00:19:06,591 --> 00:19:10,527
but you can use it
to vent your deep, angry feelings.

285
00:19:12,129 --> 00:19:14,996
You're wasting your time, Doc.
He's too much of a wimp.

286
00:19:15,099 --> 00:19:17,363
Attaboy, Alan! Let it go!

287
00:19:18,436 --> 00:19:21,098
Good!

288
00:19:21,973 --> 00:19:26,467
I'm so mad! I hate you!

289
00:19:26,544 --> 00:19:28,944
- Who do you hate, Alan? Who do you hate?
- Everybody!

290
00:19:29,013 --> 00:19:33,143
- Good! Let it go! Keep going, Alan!
- Wait a minute! Stop!

291
00:19:33,851 --> 00:19:35,045
Should I stop?

292
00:19:35,152 --> 00:19:38,144
Well, it's up to you.
You paid for the full hour, so...

293
00:19:40,825 --> 00:19:43,988
Attaboy. Hit him!

294
00:19:47,298 --> 00:19:50,028
Thank you, Doctor. That was great.
I feel much better.

295
00:19:50,134 --> 00:19:54,161
- Good.
- Yeah. We're all thrilled for you.

296
00:19:56,374 --> 00:19:59,741
And by the way, about the... You know.

297
00:20:01,379 --> 00:20:05,076
I'm not scared of them.
I just have a healthy respect.

298
00:20:07,018 --> 00:20:09,646
Fine. We'll see you both next week.

299
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:18,988
How long am I gonna have to
keep coming here?

300
00:20:47,491 --> 00:20:48,685
English
