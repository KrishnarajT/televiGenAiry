1
00:00:03,233 --> 00:00:06,473
Charlie? Honey, wake up.

2
00:00:08,617 --> 00:00:12,194
- Good morning.
- You lied to me, Charlie.

3
00:00:12,865 --> 00:00:16,529
You said it was
just going to be the two of us.

4
00:00:16,530 --> 00:00:19,124
I didn't lie, Berta. Things change.

5
00:00:19,125 --> 00:00:21,555
Goodbye, Charlie.

6
00:00:22,401 --> 00:00:24,831
Don't leave me, Berta.

7
00:00:24,963 --> 00:00:26,324
I love you.

8
00:00:26,325 --> 00:00:29,177
- Can't we talk about this?
- Sorry. I do single men only.

9
00:00:29,178 --> 00:00:33,037
I'm in, I'm out, there are no complications.

10
00:00:33,038 --> 00:00:34,400
But I am single.

11
00:00:34,401 --> 00:00:37,837
Berta? I hate to bring this up again,
but you just...

12
00:00:37,838 --> 00:00:42,442
You cannot put the peanut butter
in the refrigerator. It gets hard.

13
00:00:42,443 --> 00:00:45,297
And, on a related subject,
the peanut-butter stains

14
00:00:45,298 --> 00:00:48,994
on Jake's shirts
really require an enzyme presoak.

15
00:00:48,995 --> 00:00:52,886
I hope you two will be
very happy together.

16
00:00:52,887 --> 00:00:54,507
But who's going to take care of me?

17
00:00:54,508 --> 00:00:56,583
Who's going to do the laundry,
the shopping,

18
00:00:56,584 --> 00:01:03,174
- and the cleaning and all the other stuff?
- Ask the Scrubbing Bubble there.

19
00:01:03,492 --> 00:01:05,858
Uncle Charlie, why is Berta leaving?

20
00:01:05,859 --> 00:01:08,455
Why? It doesn't matter, Jake.

21
00:01:08,746 --> 00:01:11,186
What matters is she's gone.

22
00:01:12,638 --> 00:01:15,126
And we're all going to die.

23
00:01:24,317 --> 00:01:27,466
She left before she made the coffee.

24
00:01:28,738 --> 00:01:31,204
So? We'll make our own coffee.

25
00:01:31,205 --> 00:01:33,605
How?

26
00:01:42,096 --> 00:01:43,601
So, now we just wait?

27
00:01:43,602 --> 00:01:46,598
Yes. It takes a couple of minutes.

28
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:50,938
Alan, this goes beyond coffee.

29
00:01:50,939 --> 00:01:53,725
Berta's been with me forever.
She does everything.

30
00:01:53,726 --> 00:01:56,095
She's like a wife that leaves
before you wake up,

31
00:01:56,096 --> 00:01:59,074
and doesn't mind if you sleep around.

32
00:01:59,075 --> 00:02:01,157
Is that the coffee?

33
00:02:01,158 --> 00:02:04,557
It's my peanut butter. I made it soft.

34
00:02:04,777 --> 00:02:08,589
I've been figuring out a way to repay you
for letting me and Jake stay here.

35
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:11,664
- Why don't I take over the housework?
- Berta did the shopping, too.

36
00:02:11,665 --> 00:02:14,323
- I can do that.
- She did my laundry.

37
00:02:14,324 --> 00:02:16,724
In her way, yes.

38
00:02:16,854 --> 00:02:20,128
But I can handle that, too. And look,

39
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:22,650
I even made your coffee.

40
00:02:22,813 --> 00:02:25,213
Thank you.

41
00:02:27,042 --> 00:02:29,442
No.

42
00:02:29,765 --> 00:02:31,269
Not as good as Berta's.

43
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:35,017
It's her coffee. I just pressed the button.

44
00:02:35,018 --> 00:02:38,676
Berta's tasted, I don't know, Christmassy.

45
00:02:39,504 --> 00:02:41,809
What does that mean, "Christmassy?"

46
00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:44,210
It means "like Christmas."

47
00:02:44,533 --> 00:02:46,486
Now, you got to work with me, Charlie.

48
00:02:46,487 --> 00:02:49,721
I mean, nutmeg, cinnamon,
powdered reindeer?

49
00:02:49,722 --> 00:02:51,900
I don't know.
It's just that when you drank it,

50
00:02:51,901 --> 00:02:55,488
it felt like Christmas morning,
and anything was possible.

51
00:02:55,489 --> 00:02:58,841
Sweet'N Low? Half & Half? Mocha Mix?

52
00:02:59,109 --> 00:03:02,229
Forget it. I'll just read my paper.

53
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:05,259
Where's my paper?

54
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:07,918
I don't know.
You might try looking by the front door.

55
00:03:07,919 --> 00:03:10,224
No, it's usually right here, on the table.

56
00:03:10,225 --> 00:03:14,517
Okay, so before you got up, Berta started
the coffee and got you your paper?

57
00:03:14,518 --> 00:03:17,721
I don't know the mechanics of it,
but, yeah.

58
00:03:17,722 --> 00:03:20,122
I'll go get it.

59
00:03:21,950 --> 00:03:25,041
He's not off to a very good start.

60
00:03:25,954 --> 00:03:28,595
Want a glass of peanut butter?

61
00:03:46,041 --> 00:03:47,738
- Alan?
- Yeah?

62
00:03:47,739 --> 00:03:50,139
I can see you.

63
00:03:50,782 --> 00:03:53,182
And I can see you, too.

64
00:03:55,523 --> 00:03:58,406
No. I mean, Berta never cleaned
when I was in the room.

65
00:03:58,407 --> 00:04:00,232
She was like invisible.

66
00:04:00,233 --> 00:04:03,435
I'm sorry. I'll try to be more transparent.

67
00:04:03,436 --> 00:04:05,836
Appreciate it.

68
00:04:11,668 --> 00:04:13,302
Oh, no.

69
00:04:13,302 --> 00:04:14,551
I see you.

70
00:04:14,552 --> 00:04:16,825
Give me a break.

71
00:04:16,826 --> 00:04:20,189
Not you. That girl that's been stalking me.

72
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:22,590
Rose?

73
00:04:23,042 --> 00:04:25,315
There you are.

74
00:04:25,316 --> 00:04:29,287
What are you doing
sneaking up on me like that?

75
00:04:29,288 --> 00:04:31,241
Rose, honey,

76
00:04:31,242 --> 00:04:34,221
we spent one night together,
and it was very nice, but...

77
00:04:34,222 --> 00:04:36,622
What is your favorite part?

78
00:04:37,425 --> 00:04:42,165
Gee, I'd have to say, finding out you live
just two doors down.

79
00:04:42,166 --> 00:04:46,970
Sometimes, it's all I can do not to chew
through that house in the middle.

80
00:04:46,971 --> 00:04:48,733
Yeah.

81
00:04:48,734 --> 00:04:51,552
But see, I'm not looking for
a relationship right now.

82
00:04:51,553 --> 00:04:56,389
So, maybe you should find someone
who can give you the attention you want.

83
00:04:56,390 --> 00:04:58,600
Need, deserve,

84
00:04:58,601 --> 00:05:01,001
require.

85
00:05:02,028 --> 00:05:04,077
Are you saying we should see
other people?

86
00:05:04,078 --> 00:05:05,647
Yes, that's exactly what I'm saying.

87
00:05:05,648 --> 00:05:10,196
You have so much love to give,
and somewhere out there is a guy who

88
00:05:10,197 --> 00:05:12,535
can take it.

89
00:05:12,536 --> 00:05:17,010
- Well, there is this one guy...
- He sounds perfect.

90
00:05:17,117 --> 00:05:20,031
His name is Andy.
He works at Jamba Juice.

91
00:05:20,032 --> 00:05:25,189
He always gives me a free wheatgrass
shooter and chuckles when I gag.

92
00:05:25,190 --> 00:05:26,566
Then ask him out.

93
00:05:26,567 --> 00:05:28,808
That seems kind of forward,
don't you think?

94
00:05:28,809 --> 00:05:31,468
No, come on,
women ask guys out all the time.

95
00:05:31,469 --> 00:05:33,966
What they don't do
is handcuff themselves

96
00:05:33,967 --> 00:05:38,131
to the refrigerator,
when he says it's time to go home.

97
00:05:38,132 --> 00:05:42,104
That's where you and I
went off the track, isn't it?

98
00:05:42,105 --> 00:05:45,370
I'm the past. Andy's the future.

99
00:05:45,949 --> 00:05:48,669
Bye-bye now. Good luck,

100
00:05:49,312 --> 00:05:51,712
Andy.

101
00:06:06,323 --> 00:06:08,276
Alan?

102
00:06:08,277 --> 00:06:11,191
- What did you do to my piano?
- Nothing. I just dusted.

103
00:06:11,192 --> 00:06:15,164
Yes, well, I'm sitting here trying
to write a jingle about a chocolate bar

104
00:06:15,165 --> 00:06:17,663
and my piano smells like lemons.

105
00:06:17,664 --> 00:06:21,859
Gee, I'm sorry, Charlie.
But they don't make chocolate Pledge.

106
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:23,909
Maybe I'm not making myself clear.

107
00:06:23,910 --> 00:06:28,554
The rest of the house can smell like
any fruit you want.

108
00:06:28,555 --> 00:06:31,195
But my piano needs to smell...

109
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:33,711
- Piano-y.
- There you go.

110
00:06:33,873 --> 00:06:36,563
Fine. I'll get an unscented polish.

111
00:06:36,564 --> 00:06:40,088
That's not going to help me now, is it?

112
00:06:40,569 --> 00:06:41,977
Nope.

113
00:06:41,978 --> 00:06:46,013
You know what? You are a child.
You're a big, high-maintenance child.

114
00:06:46,014 --> 00:06:48,415
I am not a child.

115
00:06:48,481 --> 00:06:49,697
Where you going?

116
00:06:49,698 --> 00:06:55,152
If I can't write my chocolate song,
I'm going to take a nap.

117
00:07:00,494 --> 00:07:02,895
Charlie, you asleep?

118
00:07:04,402 --> 00:07:06,860
I'm doing a load of whites.

119
00:07:52,648 --> 00:07:54,601
Jeez!

120
00:07:54,602 --> 00:07:56,362
- Charlie?
- What?

121
00:07:56,363 --> 00:07:58,285
You kicked me in your sleep.

122
00:07:58,286 --> 00:08:00,655
Who said I was asleep?

123
00:08:00,656 --> 00:08:02,866
I can't do this anymore.
You are impossible.

124
00:08:02,867 --> 00:08:05,493
Don't blame me. I tried to make it work.

125
00:08:05,494 --> 00:08:07,671
Excuse me? Berta quit at 9:00.

126
00:08:07,672 --> 00:08:10,939
It's now 2:30. When did you try?
Where was the trying?

127
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:13,149
You're the one who made Berta quit.

128
00:08:13,150 --> 00:08:14,719
I didn't make her quit.

129
00:08:14,719 --> 00:08:16,834
I simply raised the bar
of quality housework

130
00:08:16,835 --> 00:08:19,332
and she insisted on limboing under it.

131
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:21,639
But since you obviously
can't live without her,

132
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:24,874
you big baby,
I will go apologize and get her back.

133
00:08:24,875 --> 00:08:27,823
- Great.
- So, where does she live?

134
00:08:30,129 --> 00:08:32,178
I don't know.

135
00:08:32,179 --> 00:08:34,589
Okay. What's her last name?

136
00:08:37,209 --> 00:08:40,475
Your entire life depends on this woman
and you know nothing about her.

137
00:08:40,476 --> 00:08:42,493
Wait.

138
00:08:42,494 --> 00:08:44,894
She took a bus.

139
00:08:45,281 --> 00:08:47,681
I stand corrected.

140
00:08:48,356 --> 00:08:51,720
After she works here in the morning,
she cleans some rock star's house.

141
00:08:51,721 --> 00:08:54,159
Okay, what rock star? Where?

142
00:08:54,508 --> 00:08:59,087
Steven Tyler from Aerosmith.
4456 Malibu Canyon Road.

143
00:09:00,562 --> 00:09:02,836
Thank you.

144
00:09:02,837 --> 00:09:06,872
Now listen, Judith is coming by at 5:00 to
pick up Jake for dinner with her parents.

145
00:09:06,873 --> 00:09:08,185
Now I should be back by then.

146
00:09:08,186 --> 00:09:10,588
But you need to make sure
he's dressed and ready to go.

147
00:09:10,589 --> 00:09:12,830
- No problem.
- No, it's a problem, Charlie.

148
00:09:12,831 --> 00:09:15,137
I'm trying desperately
to reconcile with my wife,

149
00:09:15,138 --> 00:09:16,739
so I don't want to tick her off.

150
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:19,398
So, you telling me, "It's no problem,"
does not reassure me.

151
00:09:19,399 --> 00:09:23,662
Here. Take my sock.
I want to show you a trick.

152
00:09:25,485 --> 00:09:29,748
I'll go get Berta.
You make sure Jake is ready.

153
00:09:29,810 --> 00:09:32,628
- Hi.
- Hello.

154
00:09:32,725 --> 00:09:35,672
There are security cameras out front,
so come up from the back,

155
00:09:35,673 --> 00:09:40,857
and bring some dog treats,
in case the rottweilers are out.

156
00:09:41,022 --> 00:09:43,423
Again, thank you.

157
00:09:46,885 --> 00:09:49,671
I asked Andy out, and he said yes.

158
00:09:49,672 --> 00:09:53,301
- Andy?
- That guy you told me to ask out.

159
00:09:53,452 --> 00:09:55,181
I just don't know what to wear.

160
00:09:55,182 --> 00:10:00,059
I love this one,
but it still smells like pepper spray.

161
00:10:00,629 --> 00:10:02,838
Where are you going?

162
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:05,757
To roll around naked on your bed.

163
00:10:06,843 --> 00:10:09,789
I'm just kidding.
I'm going to try on the dress, silly.

164
00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:12,190
But...

165
00:10:12,641 --> 00:10:16,197
- Is that lady your girlfriend?
- No, she's just...

166
00:10:16,198 --> 00:10:18,598
It's complicated.

167
00:10:21,034 --> 00:10:24,717
- What the hell happened to you?
- You know what else is complicated?

168
00:10:24,718 --> 00:10:26,704
Fractions.

169
00:10:26,705 --> 00:10:29,191
You got grease all over you.

170
00:10:29,652 --> 00:10:31,765
It's in your hair, man.

171
00:10:31,766 --> 00:10:35,396
Yes. My bike chain broke. Can you fix it?

172
00:10:35,867 --> 00:10:39,229
Kid, I'm a piano player. What do you think?

173
00:10:39,230 --> 00:10:42,241
Look, your mom's going to be here soon
to take you to dinner.

174
00:10:42,242 --> 00:10:43,554
I know.

175
00:10:43,555 --> 00:10:46,630
- So, how about a shower?
- No, thank you.

176
00:10:46,631 --> 00:10:49,031
That wasn't a question.

177
00:10:53,230 --> 00:10:55,504
Sorry, pal, but you need a shower.

178
00:10:55,505 --> 00:10:58,450
But my bike's still broken.
I think you made it worse.

179
00:10:58,451 --> 00:11:01,270
What are you talking about?
Now you got a unicycle.

180
00:11:01,271 --> 00:11:03,671
Get in the shower.

181
00:11:05,179 --> 00:11:09,022
- I'm so worried he's not going to like me.
- He's going to love you, Rose.

182
00:11:09,023 --> 00:11:12,290
Just go out, have a great time,
and don't come on too strong.

183
00:11:12,291 --> 00:11:15,210
Me, too strong? What do you mean?

184
00:11:15,462 --> 00:11:17,448
Okay, speaking from my own experience,

185
00:11:17,449 --> 00:11:20,427
there's nothing wrong with asking a guy
for a blood test,

186
00:11:20,428 --> 00:11:23,823
but trying to take the blood yourself
is a little strong.

187
00:11:23,824 --> 00:11:26,464
- I see.
- Where you going now?

188
00:11:26,963 --> 00:11:29,909
You got me thinking
this dress comes on too strong.

189
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:32,472
So, I'm going to put on something
a little less...

190
00:11:32,473 --> 00:11:34,874
And a little more...

191
00:11:38,528 --> 00:11:41,648
Jake, why aren't you in the shower?

192
00:11:42,436 --> 00:11:44,836
Oh, yeah.

193
00:11:57,461 --> 00:12:01,042
Hi, Berta. It's me, the Scrubbing Bubble.

194
00:12:02,137 --> 00:12:04,027
I came to apologize.

195
00:12:04,028 --> 00:12:06,428
Okay. Thank you. Bye-bye.

196
00:12:06,430 --> 00:12:09,505
Come on, can't we put aside
our petty differences

197
00:12:09,506 --> 00:12:14,021
and find a way to work together
out of a mutual love for Charlie?

198
00:12:14,022 --> 00:12:16,841
Yeah, that's why I do this. For love.

199
00:12:16,842 --> 00:12:20,973
The thing is, I'm going through
a really tough time right now.

200
00:12:20,974 --> 00:12:24,209
My marriage is collapsing,
my business is slow.

201
00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:26,515
My little boy is being dragged
back and forth

202
00:12:26,516 --> 00:12:28,662
from his mother's house to Malibu.

203
00:12:28,663 --> 00:12:31,897
My alcoholic husband ran off
with my daughter's parole officer,

204
00:12:31,898 --> 00:12:35,037
and I clean rich peoples' toilets for a living.

205
00:12:35,038 --> 00:12:38,542
Okay, let's not make this a competition.

206
00:12:42,630 --> 00:12:45,096
Jake, you've been in there for a while.
How's it going?

207
00:12:45,097 --> 00:12:47,497
Good.

208
00:12:54,226 --> 00:12:56,116
What are you doing?

209
00:12:56,117 --> 00:12:58,999
Washing my bike chain. It's real dirty.

210
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,504
Forget about the chain.

211
00:13:00,505 --> 00:13:05,306
You got to take a shower
before your mother gets here.

212
00:13:10,212 --> 00:13:13,102
We're going to need a new chain.

213
00:13:17,773 --> 00:13:19,950
Hello, Charlie's house. May I help you?

214
00:13:19,951 --> 00:13:23,826
Hi, Alan, it's Rose. I got in. How'd you do?

215
00:13:23,827 --> 00:13:25,492
Here he is.

216
00:13:25,493 --> 00:13:28,287
- It's your brother.
- Thank you.

217
00:13:32,701 --> 00:13:34,879
How's it going? Did you talk to Berta?

218
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,545
Yes, I'm here with her now.

219
00:13:36,545 --> 00:13:38,627
- ls Jake ready?
- Yes.

220
00:13:38,628 --> 00:13:42,238
We're just applying the finishing touches.

221
00:13:43,753 --> 00:13:46,956
- What about Berta?
- The same. Finishing touches.

222
00:13:46,957 --> 00:13:49,357
She's really a delight.

223
00:13:51,890 --> 00:13:55,285
Just make sure Jake is ready
when Judith gets there.

224
00:13:55,286 --> 00:13:59,452
Relax. Everything's under control.
I got to go.

225
00:14:00,028 --> 00:14:02,781
- So, you like this dress better?
- Hang on, Rose.

226
00:14:02,782 --> 00:14:05,088
The kid's running around the deck
in his underwear.

227
00:14:05,089 --> 00:14:08,547
Sure. But when I do it, you just ignore me.

228
00:14:08,548 --> 00:14:11,623
- Jake, what are you doing?
- Air drying.

229
00:14:11,624 --> 00:14:14,122
You still have grease in your hair.
Didn't you wash it?

230
00:14:14,123 --> 00:14:16,749
You didn't say to wash my hair.

231
00:14:16,749 --> 00:14:19,305
- Wash your hair.
- Okay.

232
00:14:21,907 --> 00:14:24,519
You didn't tell him to rinse.

233
00:14:24,726 --> 00:14:27,289
Good, that's good. Thank you.

234
00:14:27,449 --> 00:14:29,849
Jake, rinse!

235
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:31,837
All right, so you won't come back.

236
00:14:31,838 --> 00:14:34,944
Will you at least tell me how you made
the damn coffee Christmassy?

237
00:14:34,945 --> 00:14:36,034
Christmassy?

238
00:14:36,035 --> 00:14:38,244
Yeah, Charlie said
your coffee tastes Christmassy.

239
00:14:38,245 --> 00:14:40,736
- Cinnamon.
- I said cinnamon.

240
00:14:43,434 --> 00:14:46,632
Lower back? You do a lot of lifting?

241
00:14:46,830 --> 00:14:50,065
Of course you do.
You're a maid, and I'm an ass.

242
00:14:50,066 --> 00:14:51,731
- I'm a housekeeper.
- Of course.

243
00:14:51,732 --> 00:14:54,517
- And you're an ass.
- Yes.

244
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:57,594
Why don't you sit down,
let me take a look at it?

245
00:14:57,595 --> 00:15:00,033
- What?
- I'm a chiropractor.

246
00:15:00,766 --> 00:15:03,205
Okay. But no funny business.

247
00:15:05,059 --> 00:15:07,459
Not to worry.

248
00:15:09,896 --> 00:15:14,139
Looks like you washed
your hair instead of mine.

249
00:15:15,086 --> 00:15:17,486
I'm not in the mood, Jake.

250
00:15:18,097 --> 00:15:20,306
These clothes look stupid.

251
00:15:20,307 --> 00:15:22,707
You're 10. No one cares.

252
00:15:23,639 --> 00:15:26,137
- You're choking me.
- Trust me.

253
00:15:26,138 --> 00:15:29,052
You'll know when I'm choking you.

254
00:15:29,053 --> 00:15:31,999
I think my socks are on the wrong feet.

255
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,043
Jake, dude, I'm right on the edge.

256
00:15:36,901 --> 00:15:39,301
Don't push me.

257
00:15:40,393 --> 00:15:42,603
I can't do this on someone else.

258
00:15:42,604 --> 00:15:45,427
- Charlie?
- You look great, Rose.

259
00:15:46,609 --> 00:15:49,106
I don't think I can go through with this.

260
00:15:49,107 --> 00:15:51,979
What? No. Sure you can.

261
00:15:52,086 --> 00:15:55,802
- No, I'm going to call Andy and cancel.
- No, you're not. Now listen to me.

262
00:15:55,803 --> 00:15:58,812
You're a wonderful woman.
And this guy, Andy, is going to love you.

263
00:15:58,813 --> 00:16:01,696
Thanks, but you're saying that
just to get me out of your hair.

264
00:16:01,697 --> 00:16:04,097
No, not just.

265
00:16:06,887 --> 00:16:10,249
- Now go out and have a great time.
- But...

266
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:14,138
No goodbyes.
Just turn around and walk away.

267
00:16:14,223 --> 00:16:16,623
Okay.

268
00:16:16,754 --> 00:16:19,154
Goodbye.

269
00:16:20,630 --> 00:16:23,030
Goodbye, Rose.

270
00:16:28,766 --> 00:16:32,033
- What happened?
- I have to go to the bathroom.

271
00:16:32,034 --> 00:16:34,244
Why did you take your clothes off?

272
00:16:34,245 --> 00:16:36,645
Sometimes, I miss.

273
00:16:37,608 --> 00:16:40,928
Okay. That's it. I give up.

274
00:16:41,741 --> 00:16:44,141
You are a child, Jake.

275
00:16:45,617 --> 00:16:48,891
Dress, don't dress. Wash, don't wash.

276
00:16:48,949 --> 00:16:51,963
I don't care. You're on your own.

277
00:16:53,145 --> 00:16:55,545
What?

278
00:16:58,303 --> 00:17:01,055
God, that feels so good.

279
00:17:02,403 --> 00:17:04,894
Berta, I can't find my...

280
00:17:07,593 --> 00:17:10,316
Berta, if you're going to do a guy
in the laundry room,

281
00:17:10,317 --> 00:17:13,898
put a scarf on the doorknob or something.

282
00:17:14,993 --> 00:17:17,393
I'm a big fan.

283
00:17:21,241 --> 00:17:23,289
Is Jake ready?

284
00:17:23,290 --> 00:17:25,691
Where's Jake?

285
00:17:26,782 --> 00:17:27,934
I don't know.

286
00:17:27,935 --> 00:17:30,209
You don't know?
My wife just pulled in behind me.

287
00:17:30,210 --> 00:17:34,342
- You said you'd have him ready.
- lt can't be done.

288
00:17:34,343 --> 00:17:36,712
What do you mean, it can't be done?

289
00:17:36,713 --> 00:17:39,114
I'm not strong enough.

290
00:17:40,109 --> 00:17:42,750
His will is greater than mine.

291
00:17:44,242 --> 00:17:48,984
I'm just going to get drunk
and stay out of his way.

292
00:17:50,072 --> 00:17:53,114
Please tell me he's ready.
My parents are driving me nuts.

293
00:17:53,115 --> 00:17:54,973
Well...

294
00:17:54,973 --> 00:17:56,414
Hi, Mom.

295
00:17:56,415 --> 00:17:58,815
Don't you look handsome?

296
00:17:59,714 --> 00:18:04,208
- Uncle Charlie took my tie.
- You don't need a tie.

297
00:18:05,416 --> 00:18:07,786
Grow up, Charlie.

298
00:18:07,787 --> 00:18:09,228
Bye.

299
00:18:09,229 --> 00:18:12,935
- I thought you said he beat you?
- He did.

300
00:18:13,650 --> 00:18:16,415
Now he's just screwing with me.

301
00:18:18,391 --> 00:18:20,023
What happened with Berta?

302
00:18:20,024 --> 00:18:22,744
It wasn't easy, but I did it.

303
00:18:23,676 --> 00:18:26,559
She won't do my laundry,
or get my groceries,

304
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:30,403
and I have to give her
a lower back adjustment twice a week.

305
00:18:30,404 --> 00:18:33,755
And Steven Tyler thinks I'm doing her.

306
00:18:35,594 --> 00:18:40,779
- But she is coming back?
- Yes, Charlie, she is coming back.

307
00:18:41,457 --> 00:18:43,857
Right on.

308
00:18:46,262 --> 00:18:48,662
Are you crying?

309
00:18:50,458 --> 00:18:53,331
It's been a very emotional day.

310
00:18:56,417 --> 00:18:59,643
Here you go, buddy. Drink your vodka.

311
00:19:17,496 --> 00:19:20,136
You look great, Rose, I swear.

312
00:19:21,083 --> 00:19:22,845
He stood me up.

313
00:19:22,846 --> 00:19:26,658
What? After we spent all day
getting ready?

314
00:19:29,124 --> 00:19:32,135
- I don't know what I did wrong.
- You didn't do anything wrong.

315
00:19:32,136 --> 00:19:35,371
- Then why did he stand me up?
- Because he's an idiot.

316
00:19:35,372 --> 00:19:39,503
He doesn't get
what a truly rare person you are.

317
00:19:39,504 --> 00:19:41,329
Thanks.

318
00:19:41,330 --> 00:19:44,020
I wish Randy could see what you see.

319
00:19:44,021 --> 00:19:47,287
Forget about him. Come on,
I'm going to take you to dinner.

320
00:19:47,288 --> 00:19:49,957
- Really?
- Yeah, sure, why not?

321
00:19:57,636 --> 00:20:00,102
I thought you said his name was Andy.

322
00:20:00,103 --> 00:20:02,503
What did I say?

323
00:20:02,794 --> 00:20:06,059
- You said Randy.
- No, I didn't.

324
00:20:06,638 --> 00:20:10,286
Andy's a real guy. I didn't make him up.

325
00:20:10,322 --> 00:20:12,722
I love your little tie.
