1
00:00:02,618 --> 00:00:03,949
Master,

2
00:00:06,155 --> 00:00:09,249
your sexually ambivalent ex-wife is here.

3
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:14,453
- I'm not ambivalent, I'm exploring.
- Yes, mistress.

4
00:00:16,332 --> 00:00:20,359
- Thanks for bringing Jake over.
- Well, I wanted to give you this anyway.

5
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:23,462
- What is it?
- It's the bill from my divorce lawyer.

6
00:00:23,539 --> 00:00:27,100
- You haven't been paying them.
- Told you they'd notice.

7
00:00:27,176 --> 00:00:29,974
I also need you
to look this over and sign it.

8
00:00:30,046 --> 00:00:31,809
And what is this?

9
00:00:31,881 --> 00:00:35,510
My lawyer recommended I take out
a bigger life-insurance policy on you

10
00:00:35,618 --> 00:00:39,782
in case you should die
and can't pay the alimony and legal fees.

11
00:00:40,323 --> 00:00:41,722
Why don't you have him frozen?

12
00:00:41,824 --> 00:00:44,486
Then you can use him
to keep your drinks cold, too.

13
00:00:45,161 --> 00:00:47,152
And who's supposed to pay for this policy?

14
00:00:47,230 --> 00:00:50,165
You are. And please,
try to be on time with the premiums.

15
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:54,836
Boy, my shallow, empty lifestyle
is looking pretty good right about now.

16
00:00:55,471 --> 00:00:59,703
Okay, as long as we're on the subject
of lawyers and death,

17
00:00:59,809 --> 00:01:03,370
my lawyer recommended
that I redraft my will. And you know what?

18
00:01:03,479 --> 00:01:07,040
If I die after you die,
guess who gets custody of Jake?

19
00:01:07,149 --> 00:01:10,482
- Charlie.
- Charlie?

20
00:01:10,553 --> 00:01:12,680
- Me?
- What about my sister?

21
00:01:12,755 --> 00:01:16,748
- I never liked your sister.
- Is this the sister I slept with?

22
00:01:16,893 --> 00:01:19,191
Shut up, Charlie.

23
00:01:19,262 --> 00:01:23,062
Alan, you can't be serious.
He's immature, he drinks too much,

24
00:01:23,165 --> 00:01:25,395
he sleeps around,
he is completely irresponsible.

25
00:01:25,501 --> 00:01:28,527
Yeah, you should've thought of that
before you threw me out.

26
00:01:29,405 --> 00:01:30,599
Yeah.

27
00:01:30,907 --> 00:01:34,035
All right. You're obviously angry
and trying to get even with me,

28
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:37,546
but I am not gonna take the bait.
I will see you on Sunday.

29
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,011
Bye-bye.

30
00:01:42,552 --> 00:01:44,782
- Hey, man. Thanks.
- For what?

31
00:01:44,887 --> 00:01:48,015
For trusting me to take care of Jake
when you croak.

32
00:01:49,926 --> 00:01:53,020
I'm sorry.
You didn't think I was serious, did you?

33
00:01:53,396 --> 00:01:55,421
I just said that to piss her off.

34
00:01:56,465 --> 00:02:01,095
Right. Good one. Hey!

35
00:02:11,214 --> 00:02:12,545
That's not fair!

36
00:02:12,649 --> 00:02:15,209
Why don't I get to keep the kid
when you're dead?

37
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:21,552
If I'm dead. And Judith would have to die
before me for it to even be an issue.

38
00:02:21,658 --> 00:02:25,355
It's a contingency plan
for a hypothetical worst-case scenario.

39
00:02:25,428 --> 00:02:28,488
I know it's a long shot,
but I had the Marlins in the World Series.

40
00:02:28,565 --> 00:02:30,499
Don't tell me they don't come in.

41
00:02:30,567 --> 00:02:33,502
It never occurred to me that you'd
want to be a full-time parent.

42
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:36,198
This isn't about what I want.
This is about what you want,

43
00:02:36,272 --> 00:02:38,536
- and you don't want me to have Jake.
- What?

44
00:02:38,608 --> 00:02:39,700
Nothing.

45
00:02:39,776 --> 00:02:41,266
Why'd you say my name?

46
00:02:41,377 --> 00:02:43,504
Get over yourself, no one said your name.

47
00:02:44,581 --> 00:02:45,878
So what's wrong with me?

48
00:02:45,949 --> 00:02:49,043
Charlie, you're a great uncle.
You're there for all the fun stuff.

49
00:02:49,118 --> 00:02:52,713
I don't think you're up to the hard work
of being a full-time parent to Jake.

50
00:02:52,789 --> 00:02:53,881
- What?
- Nothing.

51
00:02:53,957 --> 00:02:55,288
Nothing.

52
00:03:01,698 --> 00:03:04,064
So if not me,
then who are you giving him to?

53
00:03:04,133 --> 00:03:07,466
I'm not giving him to anybody.
He's not a 5-pound ham.

54
00:03:08,571 --> 00:03:11,802
You know what I mean.
Who gets him in that scenario thing?

55
00:03:11,908 --> 00:03:16,140
- Cousin Jerry and his wife Faye.
- Jerry and Faye? Why Jerry and Faye?

56
00:03:16,279 --> 00:03:20,443
They've got a good marriage,
three kids, lots of dogs, a big backyard,

57
00:03:20,516 --> 00:03:22,450
and they live in a great school district.

58
00:03:22,518 --> 00:03:24,611
Yeah, but I'm your brother!

59
00:03:25,455 --> 00:03:27,423
- Charlie, it's not...
- And I live right here.

60
00:03:27,490 --> 00:03:31,426
You wouldn't have to ship him off
to Corn Hole, Kansas.

61
00:03:32,428 --> 00:03:34,419
Coventry, Rhode Island.

62
00:03:35,465 --> 00:03:37,831
Who am I thinking of that lives in Kansas?

63
00:03:37,934 --> 00:03:40,334
I don't know, Dorothy and Toto?

64
00:03:42,438 --> 00:03:45,271
All right, Alan, let me ask you something.

65
00:03:45,341 --> 00:03:48,003
If I'm here, and Jake's in Rhode Island,

66
00:03:48,111 --> 00:03:50,579
who's gonna teach him
all the things he needs to know?

67
00:03:50,647 --> 00:03:53,309
Jerry and Faye
are both college professors.

68
00:03:53,416 --> 00:03:55,816
I'm talking about the important stuff.
About life.

69
00:03:55,918 --> 00:03:57,351
Face it. When the time comes,

70
00:03:57,453 --> 00:04:00,445
are those two eggheads gonna step up
and get your kid laid?

71
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:08,358
- You're not helping your case, Charlie.
- Fine, you've made your decision.

72
00:04:08,665 --> 00:04:11,031
Despite all I've been through
with your son,

73
00:04:11,134 --> 00:04:14,069
my nephew,
obviously I have no say in the matter.

74
00:04:14,237 --> 00:04:15,363
Where are you going?

75
00:04:15,438 --> 00:04:18,430
Alan, quite frankly,
I'm a little hurt and a little disappointed,

76
00:04:18,508 --> 00:04:20,703
so I'm gonna go make myself
a big glass of vodka

77
00:04:20,777 --> 00:04:23,109
and sit and think about things.

78
00:04:23,179 --> 00:04:27,240
Charlie, wait. Okay, how about this?

79
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:31,286
If Judith dies and then I die,
and then Jerry and Faye die,

80
00:04:31,354 --> 00:04:33,345
Jake will come and live with you.

81
00:04:33,856 --> 00:04:36,916
Yeah, like I'm gonna outlive
Jerry and Faye the way I drink.

82
00:04:41,097 --> 00:04:44,464
- What do you say to Grandma?
- Can I at least open it first?

83
00:04:44,534 --> 00:04:46,525
- Jake.
- No, he's right.

84
00:04:46,636 --> 00:04:48,695
Wait and see if he likes it.

85
00:04:52,608 --> 00:04:57,204
- Now you can thank me.
- Thank you.

86
00:04:58,181 --> 00:04:59,978
I'm kidding.

87
00:05:00,049 --> 00:05:03,712
No little boy wants a framed picture
of his grandmommy.

88
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:05,845
This is for your daddy.

89
00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:10,516
- What do you say, Dad?
- Don't push me, Jake.

90
00:05:11,394 --> 00:05:13,726
That's my new photo
for the Sunday real estate section.

91
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:16,492
I thought maybe you'd like
a color print of it for your office.

92
00:05:16,566 --> 00:05:19,797
Gee, Mom, we've already got the one
of you swimming with dolphins.

93
00:05:20,636 --> 00:05:22,467
So you didn't bring me anything?

94
00:05:23,406 --> 00:05:26,898
Is that all grandmommy is good for,
to bring you gifts?

95
00:05:28,044 --> 00:05:32,378
Of course I brought you something. There.

96
00:05:35,251 --> 00:05:38,186
Crayons? I'm 10.

97
00:05:39,255 --> 00:05:41,587
Well, it's not just crayons, sweetheart.

98
00:05:41,691 --> 00:05:44,819
It's also a dinosaur coloring book.

99
00:05:46,028 --> 00:05:50,658
- But I'm 10.
- You want to trade?

100
00:05:52,001 --> 00:05:53,525
No, I'm good.

101
00:05:55,071 --> 00:05:59,269
- So, where's your brother?
- Why? What'd he get?

102
00:06:00,376 --> 00:06:03,243
Nothing. I just want to make sure
he knows why.

103
00:06:04,747 --> 00:06:07,045
He's in his room.
He's been sulking all weekend.

104
00:06:07,116 --> 00:06:10,677
- Sulking? About what?
- Well, it's the silliest thing.

105
00:06:10,753 --> 00:06:12,380
I just happened to mention

106
00:06:12,455 --> 00:06:15,788
that in the unlikely event
that Judith should die, and I should die,

107
00:06:15,892 --> 00:06:18,554
that custody of Jake would go to...

108
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:28,799
- Custody of Jake would go to who?
- Actually, it would be "whom. "

109
00:06:30,807 --> 00:06:35,107
- Alan, who gets Jake?
- Now, see, that's grammatically correct.

110
00:06:36,779 --> 00:06:38,940
- Alan.
- Jerry and Faye.

111
00:06:39,382 --> 00:06:41,213
Jerry and Faye who?

112
00:06:41,951 --> 00:06:46,718
- Your sister's son and his wife.
- Them?

113
00:06:47,757 --> 00:06:50,555
You would bypass your own mother

114
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:53,959
in favor of two potato farmers
on Long Island?

115
00:06:55,064 --> 00:06:58,124
They're agriculture professors
in Rhode Island.

116
00:06:58,234 --> 00:06:59,496
Really?

117
00:06:59,735 --> 00:07:02,431
Who am I thinking of
who lives on Long Island?

118
00:07:02,805 --> 00:07:04,830
I have no idea.

119
00:07:04,941 --> 00:07:09,435
- Well, regardless, I am deeply insulted.
- Come on, Mom.

120
00:07:09,512 --> 00:07:12,413
This is only if Judith and I both die,
and we're not dying.

121
00:07:12,482 --> 00:07:16,816
- At least, not before you.
- Now you're wishing me dead.

122
00:07:16,919 --> 00:07:20,013
- No, Mom. No, it's...
- Give me back my picture.

123
00:07:28,164 --> 00:07:32,965
No. Better you should look at it
and feel shame.

124
00:07:45,348 --> 00:07:48,511
- Hey, want to play one-on-one?
- Sure.

125
00:07:48,885 --> 00:07:50,375
Check it out.

126
00:07:56,225 --> 00:07:57,783
One, nothing.

127
00:08:00,496 --> 00:08:02,896
You know that Rhode Island
isn't really an island?

128
00:08:02,999 --> 00:08:05,194
That's just a flat-out lie.

129
00:08:11,474 --> 00:08:12,839
Two, nothing.

130
00:08:12,909 --> 00:08:15,901
Hey, I've got to run some errands,
so I'll be back in about an hour.

131
00:08:15,978 --> 00:08:17,172
You guys gonna be okay?

132
00:08:17,246 --> 00:08:19,407
Gee, Alan,
you sure I can handle the responsibility?

133
00:08:19,515 --> 00:08:22,712
What if he wants to go to college
or something?

134
00:08:23,486 --> 00:08:26,046
Charlie, please don't start.
I'll see you later.

135
00:08:26,188 --> 00:08:30,022
- Hey!
- Three, nothing.

136
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,851
- That was a time-out.
- You didn't call it.

137
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:37,329
- Fine. Three, nothing.
- You want a do-over?

138
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:41,063
No, I don't want a do-over.
Just bring it on.

139
00:08:45,174 --> 00:08:47,039
Not so easy when I'm paying attention,
is it?

140
00:08:47,109 --> 00:08:49,009
Not so hard, either.

141
00:08:54,584 --> 00:08:56,518
- My head!
- Oh, God.

142
00:09:00,723 --> 00:09:02,714
- You okay?
- No.

143
00:09:02,839 --> 00:09:05,569
- All right, don't panic.
- I'm not panicking.

144
00:09:05,775 --> 00:09:09,438
Good. You're gonna be fine.

145
00:09:09,946 --> 00:09:12,847
- We've just got to stop the bleeding.
- I'm bleeding?

146
00:09:16,552 --> 00:09:19,180
- What?
- Nothing. Just a little trickle.

147
00:09:19,722 --> 00:09:22,555
Here, take my shirt. Hold it up here.

148
00:09:22,892 --> 00:09:26,851
I'm sorry.
Okay, let's get you up, nice and slow.

149
00:09:26,929 --> 00:09:29,693
Attaboy. I'll grab my car keys
and we'll head to the hospital.

150
00:09:29,766 --> 00:09:32,200
A hospital?
I don't want to go to a hospital!

151
00:09:32,268 --> 00:09:35,101
Did I say "hospital"? I meant Disneyland.

152
00:09:36,773 --> 00:09:39,264
How's it going there, pal?
You still bleeding?

153
00:09:39,375 --> 00:09:41,900
- I don't know.
- No, don't look.

154
00:09:42,945 --> 00:09:45,004
You just hang in there,
we'll get you fixed up,

155
00:09:45,081 --> 00:09:47,242
and you'll be back home
before you know it.

156
00:09:47,717 --> 00:09:50,277
Just as soon as we find
the freaking hospital.

157
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:55,220
- You don't know where the hospital is?
- Of course I know where it is.

158
00:09:57,727 --> 00:10:00,924
I'm kind of hungry.
Can we stop for a chili cheeseburger?

159
00:10:00,997 --> 00:10:03,898
You're hungry?
How could you even think about food?

160
00:10:03,966 --> 00:10:06,491
What do you think about
when you're hungry?

161
00:10:07,637 --> 00:10:09,127
Fair enough.

162
00:10:10,139 --> 00:10:12,835
We'll get you a chili cheeseburger
at the hospital.

163
00:10:12,942 --> 00:10:16,434
- Will they have fries at the hospital?
- They have everything.

164
00:10:16,512 --> 00:10:18,844
Some people go just for the food.

165
00:10:20,483 --> 00:10:22,849
Man, we'd better call your dad.

166
00:10:29,292 --> 00:10:30,520
Hello?

167
00:10:31,327 --> 00:10:34,160
- Why do you have your father's phone?
- I don't know.

168
00:10:36,032 --> 00:10:38,159
- That's great.
- Bye.

169
00:10:42,939 --> 00:10:46,705
Yes! An ambulance.
Fifty-fifty shot he's going to a hospital.

170
00:10:47,143 --> 00:10:48,440
Hang on!

171
00:10:51,347 --> 00:10:53,178
I can't believe we beat the ambulance.

172
00:10:53,282 --> 00:10:56,217
Yeah, well, those things are just
ice-cream trucks with blood bags.

173
00:10:56,786 --> 00:10:58,549
Hi, we need to see a doctor.

174
00:10:58,654 --> 00:11:02,055
- All right. Just fill this out and have a seat.
- No, you don't understand.

175
00:11:02,158 --> 00:11:04,126
He hit his head, he's bleeding.

176
00:11:04,193 --> 00:11:06,286
- Did he lose consciousness?
- No.

177
00:11:06,396 --> 00:11:08,694
I got a little woozy, though.

178
00:11:09,198 --> 00:11:10,961
Follow my finger.

179
00:11:13,002 --> 00:11:14,799
He's gonna be fine.

180
00:11:15,671 --> 00:11:18,299
That's it? He's gonna be fine?

181
00:11:19,342 --> 00:11:22,402
That's not a medical test,
that's how you hypnotize a chicken.

182
00:11:23,479 --> 00:11:26,710
I'd like a chili cheeseburger and fries,
please.

183
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:31,380
You see, he's hallucinating.
Can you please just get him in to a doctor?

184
00:11:31,487 --> 00:11:33,148
Well, you need to fill this out first.

185
00:11:33,222 --> 00:11:36,316
Come on, this is gonna take forever.
Can't we do this later?

186
00:11:38,227 --> 00:11:39,717
Over dinner?

187
00:11:40,229 --> 00:11:42,356
Now you're hallucinating.

188
00:11:43,533 --> 00:11:45,160
Come on, buddy.

189
00:11:49,172 --> 00:11:52,403
All right. Let's see. Last name, Harper.

190
00:11:52,775 --> 00:11:55,266
First name, Jake. Ob?

191
00:11:56,279 --> 00:11:59,578
Jacob. I knew that. Middle name?

192
00:11:59,849 --> 00:12:01,942
- You don't know?
- Of course I know.

193
00:12:02,051 --> 00:12:04,611
I want to see if you know.
You fell on your head, dude.

194
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:05,744
David.

195
00:12:06,756 --> 00:12:10,089
Jacob David. They went full Old Testament
on you, didn't they?

196
00:12:11,027 --> 00:12:14,758
- Age, 10. Allergies?
- I don't know.

197
00:12:15,631 --> 00:12:18,395
Is there anything you eat
that makes you sick?

198
00:12:19,402 --> 00:12:21,131
I ate a worm once.

199
00:12:22,605 --> 00:12:25,301
No allergies.
Have you had any of the following?

200
00:12:25,408 --> 00:12:26,966
- Measles?
- I don't know.

201
00:12:27,076 --> 00:12:28,373
- Mumps?
- I don't know.

202
00:12:28,444 --> 00:12:30,776
- Chicken pox?
- Is that the one with the spots?

203
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,745
- Yeah.
- I don't know.

204
00:12:34,417 --> 00:12:37,750
All right. We're just gonna vote
the straight "no" ticket.

205
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:39,447
Family history?

206
00:12:40,389 --> 00:12:43,119
Your grandmother's always been
a pain in the ass.

207
00:12:43,726 --> 00:12:44,886
Gonzales?

208
00:12:45,728 --> 00:12:48,663
- Right here!
- I'm Gonzales.

209
00:12:51,167 --> 00:12:52,759
No, you're not.

210
00:12:55,505 --> 00:12:57,973
Right. He's Gonzales.

211
00:13:01,978 --> 00:13:06,415
- Okay, you're gonna feel a little sting.
- Nobody said I had to get a shot!

212
00:13:06,482 --> 00:13:09,076
It's just to numb your skin
so you won't feel the stitches.

213
00:13:09,151 --> 00:13:11,984
What are you gonna give me
to not feel the shot?

214
00:13:12,455 --> 00:13:15,083
It's all right, pal. I'm right here with you.

215
00:13:15,191 --> 00:13:18,024
Big deal.
I'm still gonna get a shot in my head.

216
00:13:19,629 --> 00:13:22,860
Come on, just hold my hand,
look me in the eyes.

217
00:13:23,165 --> 00:13:24,291
Go ahead, Doc.

218
00:13:25,768 --> 00:13:28,999
- Hey, go easy on the kid!
- No, you're squishing my hand!

219
00:13:31,874 --> 00:13:34,468
Sorry.
But you didn't feel the shot, did you?

220
00:13:34,544 --> 00:13:36,011
- No.
- You're welcome.

221
00:13:37,513 --> 00:13:39,276
Maybe you'd prefer to wait outside.

222
00:13:39,348 --> 00:13:41,714
I'd prefer a morphine drip
and a sponge bath,

223
00:13:41,817 --> 00:13:43,717
but the kid needs me.

224
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:48,217
- How many stitches am I gonna get?
- I don't know, three or four.

225
00:13:48,324 --> 00:13:50,155
That's all? Scott Pressman got nine

226
00:13:50,226 --> 00:13:52,626
when his sister hit him
with the Etch-A-Sketch.

227
00:13:53,496 --> 00:13:55,123
Help us out here, Doc.

228
00:13:55,197 --> 00:13:57,722
Okay, I'll go five,
but one is purely decorative.

229
00:13:57,833 --> 00:13:59,130
Thank you.

230
00:13:59,201 --> 00:14:01,795
- Is this gonna leave a scar?
- I'm afraid so.

231
00:14:01,871 --> 00:14:03,566
- No.
- Yes!

232
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:06,333
Okay, let's get started.

233
00:14:07,343 --> 00:14:09,402
Good, maybe that's your father.

234
00:14:10,413 --> 00:14:13,211
Hello. Hey, Judith.

235
00:14:16,052 --> 00:14:17,986
No, it's me, Charlie.

236
00:14:18,888 --> 00:14:23,325
What am I doing with Alan's phone?
Why? Do you want custody of that, too?

237
00:14:26,529 --> 00:14:28,429
Come on, that's funny.

238
00:14:30,166 --> 00:14:33,158
I don't know. Maybe Alan and I
accidentally switched phones.

239
00:14:33,235 --> 00:14:37,399
Why don't you try calling him on mine?
310-LICKME.

240
00:14:42,578 --> 00:14:45,706
I didn't pick it, but that's what it spells.

241
00:14:46,682 --> 00:14:48,206
Okay. Goodbye.

242
00:14:48,284 --> 00:14:50,252
Are you doing it?
'Cause I can't feel anything.

243
00:14:50,353 --> 00:14:53,516
- Yeah, that's the idea.
- Can you see my brain?

244
00:14:55,124 --> 00:14:58,616
Sure, it's a big brain.
You must be very smart.

245
00:15:00,396 --> 00:15:04,059
- Phone's ringing.
- No, it's not.

246
00:15:05,067 --> 00:15:08,298
The doctor's just stimulating
the phone-ring part of your brain.

247
00:15:09,805 --> 00:15:11,932
- Right, Doc?
- Sure, why not?

248
00:15:12,808 --> 00:15:16,801
I ordered a chili cheeseburger out there.
Will they know to bring it in?

249
00:15:20,216 --> 00:15:23,708
Come on, Mom. Those are
two completely different scenarios.

250
00:15:25,421 --> 00:15:26,547
Hey.

251
00:15:29,458 --> 00:15:30,891
Cool hats.

252
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:34,896
So, you're saying that because
I didn't name you as Jake's guardian,

253
00:15:34,964 --> 00:15:38,422
you're switching your medical
power of attorney from me to Charlie?

254
00:15:38,534 --> 00:15:40,365
- What's going on?
- Hang on.

255
00:15:40,436 --> 00:15:44,770
If Mom's ever in a coma, you're the one
who has to decide to pull the plug.

256
00:15:48,044 --> 00:15:49,238
Pull.

257
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:54,147
All right, Mom, Charlie's onboard.
Yeah, got to go.

258
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:55,547
Hey, where have you guys been?

259
00:15:55,618 --> 00:15:58,451
You know,
we went and got a couple of hamburgers,

260
00:15:58,554 --> 00:16:00,283
bought some hats.

261
00:16:02,425 --> 00:16:05,121
Ate the hamburgers, wearing the hats.

262
00:16:06,095 --> 00:16:07,289
Okay.

263
00:16:07,563 --> 00:16:11,260
- You're right, he bought it.
- Bought what?

264
00:16:13,235 --> 00:16:15,795
Dude, you can forget about a life of crime.

265
00:16:18,607 --> 00:16:20,837
Oh, my God. What happened?

266
00:16:21,077 --> 00:16:23,637
We were playing basketball,
and it got a little rough.

267
00:16:23,746 --> 00:16:25,236
- He fouled me.
- You charged.

268
00:16:25,314 --> 00:16:26,474
- Did not.
- Did, too!

269
00:16:26,582 --> 00:16:27,606
Hold on.

270
00:16:27,683 --> 00:16:29,776
- So you took him to the emergency room?
- Yes.

271
00:16:29,852 --> 00:16:32,821
Where the cheeseburgers sucked,
by the way.

272
00:16:32,922 --> 00:16:35,015
But he's okay?
There's no concussion or anything?

273
00:16:35,124 --> 00:16:37,115
- No.
- We saw my brain.

274
00:16:37,193 --> 00:16:39,661
No, we didn't. We didn't see any brains.

275
00:16:40,262 --> 00:16:42,526
Hey, why didn't you call me?

276
00:16:43,432 --> 00:16:46,424
There it is.
Why do you have my cell phone?

277
00:16:46,669 --> 00:16:48,193
I don't know.

278
00:16:48,938 --> 00:16:51,168
All right. You sure you're okay?

279
00:16:51,807 --> 00:16:54,139
- Can I go watch TV?
- Sure.

280
00:16:58,314 --> 00:17:00,373
I am really sorry, Alan.

281
00:17:00,616 --> 00:17:04,143
- Don't worry about it. He's fine.
- Yeah, but I'm not.

282
00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:05,780
You were right.

283
00:17:05,855 --> 00:17:09,222
I obviously can't be trusted
to take care of Jake.

284
00:17:09,725 --> 00:17:11,625
Believe me,
the second you're in the ground,

285
00:17:11,694 --> 00:17:14,356
I'm sticking that kid on a plane
to Rhode Island.

286
00:17:15,397 --> 00:17:17,058
Charlie, let me tell you something.

287
00:17:17,166 --> 00:17:19,396
You can't keep Jake
from ever getting hurt.

288
00:17:19,502 --> 00:17:22,403
I mean, he's a boy. That's...
Getting hurt is like his job.

289
00:17:23,005 --> 00:17:27,499
Last summer, he actually fractured his ass
doing a cannonball into the bathtub.

290
00:17:28,644 --> 00:17:31,135
All I care about
is that he has somebody who loves him

291
00:17:31,213 --> 00:17:35,377
and who'll step up when it really counts.
And that's what you did today.

292
00:17:36,485 --> 00:17:39,420
Yeah, I guess I did, didn't I?

293
00:17:39,755 --> 00:17:41,916
Yeah. And if, God forbid,

294
00:17:42,024 --> 00:17:45,084
something should ever happen
to Judith and me,

295
00:17:46,762 --> 00:17:51,256
I would be very comfortable knowing
that you were looking after my son.

296
00:17:51,901 --> 00:17:53,869
Dead, but comfortable.

297
00:17:57,873 --> 00:18:00,535
Does this mean
you're putting me in the will?

298
00:18:01,277 --> 00:18:05,008
- Yeah.
- Wow. Thanks, man.

299
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:10,013
That means a lot.

300
00:18:10,786 --> 00:18:13,846
- Just do me a favor, all right?
- What's that?

301
00:18:13,923 --> 00:18:15,356
Don't die.

302
00:18:22,932 --> 00:18:25,730
- That's a very cute hat.
- Thank you.

303
00:18:26,235 --> 00:18:28,260
It makes my hair sweat.

304
00:18:29,638 --> 00:18:32,004
Oh, my God!
What happened to your head?

305
00:18:32,107 --> 00:18:35,076
I got five stitches.
There was blood everywhere.

306
00:18:36,111 --> 00:18:38,841
- Why didn't anyone tell me?
- I just did.

307
00:18:39,748 --> 00:18:42,911
- Can we stop for pizza?
- I can't believe this.

308
00:18:42,985 --> 00:18:45,852
I'm going to have a little talk
with your father.

309
00:18:51,527 --> 00:18:52,789
Hello?

310
00:19:20,990 --> 00:19:22,184
English
