Was when your family
rented that house in maryland

182
00:06:46,259 --> 00:06:47,659
And your grandpa
took you crabbing.

183
00:06:47,661 --> 00:06:49,694
I remember when we were there
and he said,

"you know, when you turn 18,
I'm gonna take you to vegas

a different kind of crabs."

I'm here whenever you need me.

357
00:13:15,915 --> 00:13:17,215
Alan, you're not
getting the house.

358
00:13:17,217 --> 00:13:19,150
Damn it!

359
00:13:19,152 --> 00:13:20,484
This is weird.

360
00:13:20,486 --> 00:13:21,986
Feel like I should be
doing something dad-like.

361
00:13:21,988 --> 00:13:24,989
Like drinking beers outside.

362
00:13:24,991 --> 00:13:26,524
Or grilling something.

363
00:13:26,526 --> 00:13:27,825
You know, something manly.

364
00:13:27,827 --> 00:13:29,093
Oh, perfect!

365
00:13:29,095 --> 00:13:30,094
Uh, I have a nice, thick

366
00:13:30,096 --> 00:13:31,495
Portobello mushroom
you can grill.

367
00:13:31,497 --> 00:13:33,097
I said "something manly."

368
00:13:33,099 --> 00:13:34,665
Well, if you close your eyes,
you'll swear you have

369
00:13:34,667 --> 00:13:35,733
A piece of meat in your mouth.

370
00:13:35,735 --> 00:13:38,936
I'm never closing my eyes again.

371
00:13:38,938 --> 00:13:40,538
Just give me a beer.

372
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:42,773
So, uh, how's it going
with ms. Mcmartin?

373
00:13:42,775 --> 00:13:45,009
She seemed a little standoffish
at the courthouse.

374
00:13:45,011 --> 00:13:46,043
You know, I think
she was just trying

375
00:13:46,045 --> 00:13:47,278
To keep things professional.

376
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:48,779
There's nothing going on
between us anymore.

377
00:13:48,781 --> 00:13:50,114
Guess it doesn't matter.

378
00:13:50,116 --> 00:13:52,283
We always knew it would
end up like this.

379
00:13:52,285 --> 00:13:53,584
Just you and me.

380
00:13:53,586 --> 00:13:55,019
Couple of cool bros,

381
00:13:55,021 --> 00:13:56,854
Couple of chilled brews...

382
00:13:56,856 --> 00:13:58,623
And a couple of grilled 'bellos.

383
00:13:58,625 --> 00:14:02,393
Stop trying to shove
your mushrooms down my throat!

384
00:14:02,395 --> 00:14:04,862
My point is we don't need
anything else to be happy.

385
00:14:04,864 --> 00:14:07,031
(grunts)
or anyone.

386
00:14:07,033 --> 00:14:08,099
Right, right!

387
00:14:08,101 --> 00:14:10,034
Let lyndsey move
to san francisco.

388
00:14:10,036 --> 00:14:12,036
There's no way I'm giving up
all this for her!

389
00:14:12,038 --> 00:14:13,304
I mean, look at this house!

390
00:14:13,306 --> 00:14:17,141
Look at the ocean and the view!

391
00:14:17,143 --> 00:14:18,943
That's why you broke up?

392
00:14:19,911 --> 00:14:21,379
You had a choice between lyndsey

393
00:14:21,381 --> 00:14:22,913
And this house,

394
00:14:22,915 --> 00:14:24,649
And you chose this house?

395
00:14:24,651 --> 00:14:26,817
Yep.

396
00:14:26,819 --> 00:14:29,954
Okay, you gave up a relationship
with a woman who knows

397
00:14:29,956 --> 00:14:34,158
Everything about you
and still wants to be with you

398
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:36,560
Because you didn't want
to leave this house?

399
00:14:36,562 --> 00:14:38,929
Yep.

400
00:14:38,931 --> 00:14:40,331
Okay, as I'm saying
this out loud,

401
00:14:40,333 --> 00:14:42,667
You are realizing what
a moron you are, aren't you?

402
00:14:42,669 --> 00:14:44,135
Yep.

403
00:14:44,137 --> 00:14:46,837
But-but I'm not the only one.

404
00:14:46,839 --> 00:14:49,273
Ms. Mcmartin is perfect for you.

405
00:14:49,275 --> 00:14:51,242
Come on, you're the one
who said she was crazy.

406
00:14:51,244 --> 00:14:54,178
Yes, yes, but when you really
look at it, what has she done?

407
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:56,180
I mean, she fell in love
too quickly... Like you.

408
00:14:56,182 --> 00:14:58,082
She only wants
what's best for louis...

409
00:14:58,084 --> 00:14:59,517
Like you.

410
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:01,919
She's inexplicably
drawn to me...

411
00:15:01,921 --> 00:15:03,688
Like you.

412
00:15:03,690 --> 00:15:07,558
She did surprise me by cooking
my favorite meal naked.

413
00:15:08,493 --> 00:15:09,827
Sadly, like you.

414
00:15:09,829 --> 00:15:11,996
I mean, at least I-I traded
lyndsey for a house.

415
00:15:11,998 --> 00:15:13,464
What did you trade
ms. Mcmartin for?

416
00:15:13,466 --> 00:15:14,498
Nothing.

417
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:15,833
It's worse!

418
00:15:15,835 --> 00:15:18,069
I traded her for you!

419
00:15:19,538 --> 00:15:21,105
Oh, my god! We're idiots!

420
00:15:21,107 --> 00:15:22,206
I know. We're gonna die alone!

421
00:15:22,208 --> 00:15:25,176
Worse! We're gonna die
with each other!

00:19:51,911 --> 00:19:56,447
♪ when a man loves a woman...

536
00:19:56,449 --> 00:19:58,148
♪ men. ♪

537
00:20:04,489 --> 00:20:06,557
Boarding pass?
Oh!

538
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:08,425
Here you go, good sir.

539
00:20:08,427 --> 00:20:10,728
This is a chinese takeout menu.

540
00:20:10,730 --> 00:20:13,497
Okay, okay, um, I do not have,

541
00:20:13,499 --> 00:20:14,765
Uh, a boarding pass.

542
00:20:14,767 --> 00:20:17,067
But if you will let me
go to that gate,

543
00:20:17,069 --> 00:20:19,470
I'll do anything.

544
00:20:19,472 --> 00:20:22,473
Anything.

545
00:20:22,475 --> 00:20:24,642
You can't go to the gate
without a boarding pass.

546
00:20:24,644 --> 00:20:26,644
Have you ever been in love, sir?

547
00:20:26,646 --> 00:20:28,445
Yes. With america.

548
00:20:28,447 --> 00:20:30,614
Who I'm here to protect.

549
00:20:30,616 --> 00:20:33,250
That's why nobody gets through
without a boarding pass.

550
00:20:33,252 --> 00:20:34,818
Someone left a bag unattended!

551
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:36,587
Lyndsey!

552
00:20:36,589 --> 00:20:37,621
We've got a runner!

553
00:20:37,623 --> 00:20:39,189
Lyndsey! Lyndsey!

554
00:20:39,191 --> 00:20:40,190
