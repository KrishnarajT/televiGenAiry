I had to let you do it to me.

Not that.

Although, remind me
to throw away that cat toy.

No, I meant the fact

professionally out there.

You gave us a kid,
I gave you an orgasm.

Well, technically,
both of those are still pending.

20
00:00:53,722 --> 00:00:55,123
But I'm serious.

21
00:00:55,125 --> 00:00:57,625

Right, right, I-I really

To my surprise—

27
00:01:09,005 --> 00:01:11,005

Yes, I am wearing

48
00:02:03,626 --> 00:02:06,127
She gave my penis a good home.

49
00:02:06,129 --> 00:02:08,629
I thought this was gonna be
something that you did once,

50
00:02:08,631 --> 00:02:11,099
Like manscaping

Oh, no, no, it's

53
00:02:16,106 --> 00:02:17,738
Uh, plus, we-we really
like each other,

54
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:19,107
And we agreed
to respect boundaries.

00:02:19,109 --> 00:02:20,741
You know— personal life,
professional life.

56
00:02:20,743 --> 00:02:22,743
Okay, and what boundaries
are you respecting

57
00:02:22,745 --> 00:02:24,412
When you're bragging
about having sex with her?

58
00:02:24,414 --> 00:02:26,781
That's just something a man
wants to share with his husband.

She's here to
check up on louis.

62
00:02:31,121 --> 00:02:32,353
It was supposed
to be a surprise.

63
00:02:34,256 --> 00:02:35,389
(stammering):
Wait up, hold on...

64
00:02:35,391 --> 00:02:36,657
She told you this?

65
00:02:36,659 --> 00:02:38,893
No, she didn't tell me—
we have boundaries.

66
00:02:38,895 --> 00:02:41,996
I saw it on her phone when I
was going through her texts.

67
00:02:45,134 --> 00:02:46,901
Hello, walden.

00:02:48,805 --> 00:02:50,238
Hi.

70
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,073
What a surprise.

71
00:02:52,075 --> 00:02:53,474
Come on in.

72
00:02:56,612 --> 00:02:58,312
Hey, girl.

73
00:02:59,982 --> 00:03:02,316
You are social workin' it.

74
00:03:04,119 --> 00:03:05,520
Can I get you anything?

75
00:03:05,522 --> 00:03:07,522
Like a new boyfriend?

76
00:03:07,524 --> 00:03:10,525
Okay, so obviously
alan told you about us.

77
00:03:10,527 --> 00:03:11,692
Uh, yes, he has.

78
00:03:11,694 --> 00:03:13,194
Look, I want
you to know

79
00:03:13,196 --> 00:03:15,596
This will in no way affect
our professional relationship.

80
00:03:15,598 --> 00:03:18,332
I am here strictly as your
and louis's caseworker.

81
00:03:18,334 --> 00:03:20,168
And let me tell you
something right now,

82
00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:22,036
I want to back that case up.

83
00:03:24,706 --> 00:03:27,508
You know, alan, the lucky thing
is that after I smack you,

84
00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:30,344
There's already a social worker
here to report it to.

85
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:33,548
So how is everything
going with louis?

86
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:34,982
You know, it's good.

87
00:03:34,984 --> 00:03:37,785
Uh, but I have
a couple questions.

88
00:03:37,787 --> 00:03:41,189
Like... Like, okay, for example,

89
00:03:41,191 --> 00:03:43,157
What's the best way
to discipline him?

90
00:03:43,159 --> 00:03:45,593
Uh, I believe she
favors spanking.

91
00:03:51,166 --> 00:03:53,367
All right, what do I say

92
00:03:53,369 --> 00:03:56,170
When he asks
about his biological parents?

93
00:03:56,172 --> 00:04:00,241
And how much cheese
is too much cheese?

94
00:04:00,243 --> 00:04:02,143
Okay, how about we just do
one question at a time?

95
00:04:02,145 --> 00:04:03,344
Okay, okay.

96
00:04:03,346 --> 00:04:04,712
There's some cultural
things, like—

97
00:04:04,714 --> 00:04:07,148
Should I teach him
a cool handshake,

98
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:08,716
Or does that just make me lame?

99
00:04:08,718 --> 00:04:10,551
Good question, bro.

100
00:04:13,322 --> 00:04:14,555
Blow it up.

101
00:04:15,924 --> 00:04:17,525
You know what might help?

102
00:04:17,527 --> 00:04:19,160
Talking to other foster parents.

103
00:04:19,162 --> 00:04:20,728
Actually,
some of my dads have started

104
00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:22,063
An informal support group.

105
00:04:22,065 --> 00:04:24,065
They kick around these kind
of questions every week.

106
00:04:24,067 --> 00:04:25,233
Oh, that'd be
great for you.

107
00:04:25,235 --> 00:04:26,667
Uh, I went to a group
for divorced dads,

108
00:04:26,669 --> 00:04:28,102
And it really helped.

109
00:04:28,104 --> 00:04:30,705
Uh, I also went to a group
for people whose moms died,

110
00:04:30,707 --> 00:04:32,473

just wishful thinking.

we can steal some waters

00:05:19,422 --> 00:05:21,289
And bargain for bruised peaches?

136
00:05:21,291 --> 00:05:22,890
I can just go
to the supermarket.

137
00:05:22,892 --> 00:05:24,992

So, uh, what's
your kid situation?

179
00:06:53,249 --> 00:06:54,482
Uh, I got a boy.

180
00:06:54,484 --> 00:06:55,416
Uh, his name's louis.

181
00:06:55,418 --> 00:06:56,851
He's six.

182
00:06:56,853 --> 00:07:00,354
Uh, he likes minecraft and legos
and, apparently,

183
00:07:00,356 --> 00:07:03,157
Twice as much cheese
as what doctors recommend.

184
00:07:03,159 --> 00:07:05,359
Nice. I got
three daughters.

185
00:07:05,361 --> 00:07:07,328
I always wanted a son,
so, uh, we adopted josh.

186
00:07:07,330 --> 00:07:08,863
Now I got half
a girl's volleyball team

187
00:07:08,865 --> 00:07:10,398
And a boy who wants
to be their cheerleader.

188
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,566
But I love him—
no judgment.

189
00:07:13,902 --> 00:07:16,537
My wife and I adopted
a four-year-old girl, micah.

190
00:07:16,539 --> 00:07:18,706
I also do alarm systems,
in case you're in the market.

191
00:07:18,708 --> 00:07:20,107
Give me your contact info,

192
00:07:20,109 --> 00:07:22,109
I'll put you down
on my weekly e-mail blast.

193
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:23,544
All the guys get it.

194
00:07:23,546 --> 00:07:24,445
(imitating cough):
Mark as spam.

195
00:07:24,447 --> 00:07:26,080
(chuckles)

196
00:07:26,082 --> 00:07:27,681
That is funny.

197
00:07:27,683 --> 00:07:30,050
Jack's alarm code is #227.

198
00:07:30,052 --> 00:07:33,120
I got three grown kids
from my first marriage,

199
00:07:33,122 --> 00:07:35,556
And heidi and I just adopted
a seven-year-old girl.

200
00:07:35,558 --> 00:07:37,558
Wow. You must really love kids.

201
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:39,960
Kids are fine.
What I love is heidi.

202
00:07:40,629 --> 00:07:42,062
You saw her.

203
00:07:42,064 --> 00:07:43,798
When I was in college,

204
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:46,500
Her mother was in sixth grade.

205
00:07:47,469 --> 00:07:48,803
And if you think about it,

206
00:07:48,805 --> 00:07:51,138
My next wife
isn't even born yet.

207
00:07:53,775 --> 00:07:56,377
So, uh, why did you and
your wife choose to adopt?

208
00:07:56,379 --> 00:07:59,146
My wife is incapable
of having children.

209
00:07:59,148 --> 00:08:00,414
Oh.
Oh.
Oh.

210
00:08:00,416 --> 00:08:01,382
Yeah, his name is alan.

211
00:08:01,384 --> 00:08:02,983
Oh.
Oh.
Oh.

212
00:08:02,985 --> 00:08:04,418
A-although, uh,

213
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:06,420
He did order boner pills
from china once

214
00:08:06,422 --> 00:08:08,088
That made him lactate.

215
00:08:08,090 --> 00:08:09,557
(chuckles)

216
00:08:09,559 --> 00:08:10,825
(chuckles)
uh,

217
00:08:10,827 --> 00:08:12,760
So, anything going on
with louis?

218
00:08:12,762 --> 00:08:14,595
Yeah, you know,
I have a couple questions

219
00:08:14,597 --> 00:08:16,464
That-that you're
the perfect person to answer.

220
00:08:16,466 --> 00:08:18,065
Why is that?

221
00:08:19,301 --> 00:08:21,302
'cause I'm handsome? Charming?

222
00:08:21,304 --> 00:08:23,671
College graduate?
Top home security specialist

223
00:08:23,673 --> 00:08:25,773
In the south bay
three years running?

224
00:08:25,775 --> 00:08:28,976
Yes, that...

225
00:08:28,978 --> 00:08:31,979
Louis is also all those things.

226
00:08:31,981 --> 00:08:33,914
I'm just messing with you!

227
00:08:33,916 --> 00:08:35,449
(chuckles)
yeah.

228
00:08:35,451 --> 00:08:38,452
Ms. Mcmartin told us
your kid was mixed-race.

229
00:08:38,454 --> 00:08:39,687
So what do you want to know?

230
00:08:39,689 --> 00:08:41,922
Uh, do you want to know
how to comb his hair?

231
00:08:41,924 --> 00:08:43,791
Uh, what type of music
to expose him to?

232
00:08:43,793 --> 00:08:45,626
Do I need to teach
him a cool handshake?

233
00:08:45,628 --> 00:08:47,628
So that's-that's actually
a thing?

234
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:50,865
Yeah, yeah. Here, let me
show you, let me show you.
Oh.

235
00:08:50,867 --> 00:08:52,867
Huh? Huh?
Ooh.

236
00:08:52,869 --> 00:08:54,134
That is cool.

237
00:08:54,136 --> 00:08:55,636
And you just did it

238
00:08:55,638 --> 00:08:57,505
To hand me your business card.

239
00:08:57,507 --> 00:08:59,540
Yeah. If you tell me
that I sent you,

240
00:08:59,542 --> 00:09:01,609
Then you get 20% off.

241
00:09:03,111 --> 00:09:05,513
By the way,
have you seen my wife?

242
00:09:05,515 --> 00:09:07,481
♪ men. ♪

243
00:09:07,483 --> 00:09:09,316
Hey, uh, thanks
for having me.

244
00:09:09,318 --> 00:09:11,652
You know, this is great.
I-I don't think I knew it,

245
00:09:11,654 --> 00:09:12,987
But I needed a place like this.

246
00:09:12,989 --> 00:09:14,822
You mean a place
to get away from our wives?

247
00:09:14,824 --> 00:09:16,323
Preach!

248
00:09:16,325 --> 00:09:18,726
Wait, why do you need a place?
You're married to a guy.

249
00:09:18,728 --> 00:09:21,529
Your only problem is, do I
watch sportscenter before,

250
00:09:21,531 --> 00:09:23,531
During or after sex?

251
00:09:23,533 --> 00:09:26,700
Uh, actually, it's-it's a little
more complicated than that.

252
00:09:26,702 --> 00:09:27,701
What do you mean?

253
00:09:27,703 --> 00:09:29,036
I mean, well, imagine...

254
00:09:29,038 --> 00:09:31,739
All of the wife
and none of the sex.

255
00:09:31,741 --> 00:09:34,475
Yeah, we don't need to imagine.
We're married, too.

256
00:09:34,477 --> 00:09:36,677
I don't know what you guys
are talking about.

257
00:09:36,679 --> 00:09:38,579
I get all the sex
I can handle.

258
00:09:38,581 --> 00:09:41,849
Which, at my age,
is about once a month.

259
00:09:41,851 --> 00:09:45,653
Can-can I share something
that doesn't leave this room?

260
00:09:45,655 --> 00:09:48,656
Yeah, sure. Oh, these guys know
that back when I was single...

261
00:09:48,658 --> 00:09:50,391
(whispers):
I used to bang his sister.

262
00:09:52,727 --> 00:09:55,362
Okay, here's the thing.

263
00:09:55,364 --> 00:09:56,997
I'm not gay.

264
00:09:58,166 --> 00:09:59,567
I-I married my best friend

265
00:09:59,569 --> 00:10:01,035
So I could adopt louis.

266
00:10:01,037 --> 00:10:02,503
Really?

267
00:10:02,505 --> 00:10:05,072
Then you shouldn't have any
of these problems.

268
00:10:05,074 --> 00:10:07,341
And yet I have all
of these problems.

269
00:10:07,343 --> 00:10:09,410
I mean, that's why
it's so great coming here.

270
00:10:09,412 --> 00:10:10,911
I get to get away from alan.

271
00:10:10,913 --> 00:10:13,614
I mean, he wants
to do everything with me.

272
00:10:13,616 --> 00:10:16,817
He ordered a groupon
for two-for-one prostate exams.

273
00:10:18,553 --> 00:10:20,387
Are your wives that clingy?

274
00:10:20,389 --> 00:10:22,556
Oh, yeah.
My wife just bought golf clubs

275
00:10:22,558 --> 00:10:25,025
So she could ruin golf for me.

276
00:10:25,027 --> 00:10:28,796
My wife's outside waiting
in the minivan.

277
00:10:28,798 --> 00:10:31,565
Yeah, even I have to get away
from heidi every now and then.

278
00:10:31,567 --> 00:10:34,635
Do you know what
the worst "wife" thing is?

279
00:10:34,637 --> 00:10:37,871
When you forget to ask them,
"how was your day?"

280
00:10:37,873 --> 00:10:39,206
Oh.
No, no,

281
00:10:39,208 --> 00:10:41,108
The worst thing
is when you ask alan,

282
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:43,644
"how was your day?"
and he answers.

283
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:46,714
You know, it's funny—
I-I always thought

284
00:10:46,716 --> 00:10:48,549
Being married to a guy
would be different.

285
00:10:48,551 --> 00:10:50,584
In some ways, it is.
I mean, uh... For example,

286
00:10:50,586 --> 00:10:52,653
I imagine that you guys enjoy it

287
00:10:52,655 --> 00:10:54,588
When you walk in
on your wives masturbating.

288
00:10:54,590 --> 00:10:56,156
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, yeah...

289
00:10:56,158 --> 00:10:58,225
Oh, no!

290
00:10:59,561 --> 00:11:01,895
♪ men. ♪

291
00:11:01,897 --> 00:11:04,565
Hey, there you are.
We didn't get to talk yesterday.

292
00:11:04,567 --> 00:11:06,600
How was your day?

293
00:11:06,602 --> 00:11:08,602
Great. How was your...

294
00:11:08,604 --> 00:11:10,437
Day?

295
00:11:10,439 --> 00:11:12,439
Oh, oh, it was the worst.

296
00:11:12,441 --> 00:11:14,608
Fade in: Supermarket.
There were only two lanes open,

297
00:11:14,610 --> 00:11:16,176
But there must have been
30 of us.

298
00:11:16,178 --> 00:11:19,146
30? Wow, that's
an amazing end to that story.

299
00:11:19,148 --> 00:11:21,348
I wish. You know they don't
give you bags anymore?

300
00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:23,350
If you want a bag,
that's ten cents.

301
00:11:23,352 --> 00:11:25,352
Ten cents.
That's outrageous.

302
00:11:25,354 --> 00:11:26,854
That's six bruised peaches.

303
00:11:27,989 --> 00:11:29,790
Uh, anyway, so I-I
went out to the parking lot

304
00:11:29,792 --> 00:11:30,791
And there was a...
Alan, can...

305
00:11:30,793 --> 00:11:32,760
Can we just jump to the end?

306
00:11:32,762 --> 00:11:35,262
She agreed not to press charges.

307
00:11:35,264 --> 00:11:39,633
Okay, that is the end to, like,
way too many of your stories.

308
00:11:39,635 --> 00:11:41,769
So, uh, how did your
foster dads group go?

309
00:11:41,771 --> 00:11:43,637
I-I texted you,
but you never answered.

310
00:11:43,639 --> 00:11:45,606
Really?

311
00:11:45,608 --> 00:11:48,208
I... That's...
I must not have gotten it.

312
00:11:48,210 --> 00:11:51,512
Are you sure? Uh, it says
it was read at 7:47.

313
00:11:52,847 --> 00:11:55,716
I guess it was ignored at 7:48.

314
00:11:55,718 --> 00:11:58,619
Dads group was really fun.

315
00:11:58,621 --> 00:12:00,487
Yeah, I think it's gonna be
really gonna helpful for louis.

316
00:12:00,489 --> 00:12:02,456
Oh, great, great. Uh, when
are you gonna do it again?

317
00:12:02,458 --> 00:12:04,291
Uh... Well, you know,
I was gonna actually

318
00:12:04,293 --> 00:12:05,659
Have the guys over tonight.

319
00:12:05,661 --> 00:12:08,395
Tonight? The place is a mess.

320
00:12:08,397 --> 00:12:10,631
And the good wiis on.

321
00:12:10,633 --> 00:12:11,899
Mmm.

322
00:12:11,901 --> 00:12:14,468
Well, I do want to meet
the guys, though.

323
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:17,671
Oh. Well, you know, it's a...
It's actually, it's a pretty

324
00:12:17,673 --> 00:12:19,373
Tight-knit group, so...

325
00:12:19,375 --> 00:12:21,542
I don't think people
will be able to open up

326
00:12:21,544 --> 00:12:22,976
If there's a stranger around.
Besides, don't...

327
00:12:22,978 --> 00:12:24,912
Don't you and ms. Mcmartin
have a thing tonight?

328
00:12:24,914 --> 00:12:27,481
Nope. Uh-uh.
Free as a boner in sweat pants.

329
00:12:27,483 --> 00:12:29,349
No. Come on.

330
00:12:29,351 --> 00:12:32,152
You deserve a thing, so...

331
00:12:32,154 --> 00:12:33,721
Here.

332
00:12:33,723 --> 00:12:35,923
Well, I-I do deserve a thing.

333
00:12:35,925 --> 00:12:37,224
Hey, hey—
you only give me money

334
00:12:37,226 --> 00:12:38,559
When you're trying
to get rid of me.

335
00:12:38,561 --> 00:12:41,562
No, I don't.
Here, take more money.

336
00:12:42,731 --> 00:12:44,732
Wait, hold on.
Do you...

337
00:12:44,734 --> 00:12:46,200
Do you not want me
around tonight?

338
00:12:46,202 --> 00:12:48,702
No, it's just... It's just...

339
00:12:48,704 --> 00:12:50,671
I had fun last night,

340
00:12:50,673 --> 00:12:52,940
And I want to have fun
again tonight.

341
00:12:52,942 --> 00:12:56,343
I see. And webster's
defines fun as having

342
00:12:56,345 --> 00:12:59,546
Or pertaining to
the absence of alan.

343
00:12:59,548 --> 00:13:02,382
From the latin:
Hurticus feelingsmus.

344
00:13:02,384 --> 00:13:04,885
Okay, are you really asking
why I don't want you around

345
00:13:04,887 --> 00:13:06,720
While you're talking like that?

346
00:13:06,722 --> 00:13:07,955
Oh, so you really
don't want me around?

347
00:13:07,957 --> 00:13:11,425
Yes, or as defined
in webster's, affirmative.

348
00:13:11,427 --> 00:13:13,093
Don't take my dictionary thing.
Well,

I don't have anything
for myself.

351
00:13:16,632 --> 00:13:19,099
I mean, every time
I turn around, there you are.

352
00:13:19,101 --> 00:13:22,770
Oh, what? Let's just do it.
Look, oh, there you are.

One thing where
you're not around.

358
00:13:33,549 --> 00:13:34,915

359
00:13:34,917 --> 00:13:37,551
Fine. If that's
