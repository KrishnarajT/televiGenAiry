178
00:06:45,286 --> 00:06:46,679
By the way, Ferris Bueller
is my favorite movie.

179
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:51,509
Wait, B-Berta.
W-Where are you going?

180
00:06:51,596 --> 00:06:52,772
We're not supposed
to go back there yet.

181
00:06:52,859 --> 00:06:54,469
I'm a nun at a hospital.

182
00:06:54,556 --> 00:06:56,819
I can do whatever
the hell I want.

183
00:07:03,391 --> 00:07:05,610
I'm dead.

184
00:07:10,006 --> 00:07:11,747
And I'm in hell.

185
00:07:13,009 --> 00:07:14,315
Relax.

186
00:07:14,402 --> 00:07:16,230
You're in the hospital.

187
00:07:16,317 --> 00:07:18,319
You had a mild heart attack,
but you're gonna be fine.

188
00:07:18,406 --> 00:07:20,147
I don't feel very good.

189
00:07:20,234 --> 00:07:22,323
That's because they put
a stent in your heart.

190
00:07:22,410 --> 00:07:24,804
But also I feel really good.

191
00:07:24,891 --> 00:07:29,025
That's because they put morphine
in your veins.

192
00:07:29,112 --> 00:07:31,724
We should start keeping morphine
in the house.

193
00:07:31,811 --> 00:07:34,422
I know a guy.

194
00:07:34,509 --> 00:07:37,991
Berta, you're so funny.

195
00:07:38,078 --> 00:07:41,168
I would've missed you so much
if I would've died.

196
00:07:41,255 --> 00:07:43,213
Oh, oh, but you don't
have to worry about that.

197
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:44,258
Y-You're not going anywhere.

198
00:07:44,345 --> 00:07:45,912
I love you guys.

199
00:07:45,999 --> 00:07:47,174
We love you, too.

200
00:07:47,261 --> 00:07:49,437
You know, when I think about it,

201
00:07:49,524 --> 00:07:52,092
you guys are
my only real family.

202
00:07:52,179 --> 00:07:54,137
Oh, Walden, that's so...

203
00:07:54,224 --> 00:07:56,618
Horrible.

204
00:07:56,705 --> 00:07:57,924
Okay.

205
00:07:58,011 --> 00:08:00,361
Saved your life, but whatever.

206
00:08:00,448 --> 00:08:02,450
My life is pathetic.

207
00:08:02,537 --> 00:08:05,453
I mean, thank you guys so much
for being here.

208
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:08,325
But you're not good enough!

209
00:08:08,412 --> 00:08:11,111
Okay, now it sounds
like my family.

210
00:08:11,198 --> 00:08:12,721
Um...

211
00:08:12,808 --> 00:08:14,027
Maybe you should rest.

212
00:08:14,114 --> 00:08:15,376
You know, just go
to your happy place.

213
00:08:15,463 --> 00:08:16,899
I know a shortcut.

214
00:08:16,986 --> 00:08:17,900
Say when.

215
00:08:17,987 --> 00:08:19,249
Whe...

216
00:08:19,336 --> 00:08:21,817
[squeals]

217
00:08:21,904 --> 00:08:24,994
Dressed as a nun,
giving some guy morphine...

218
00:08:25,081 --> 00:08:27,605
boy, does this take me
back to high school.

219
00:08:34,003 --> 00:08:36,179
Hey, how you feeling?

220
00:08:36,266 --> 00:08:37,267
I'm all right.

221
00:08:37,354 --> 00:08:39,182
Well, uh, I know

222
00:08:39,269 --> 00:08:41,402
something that'll
make you feel better.

223
00:08:41,489 --> 00:08:43,447
I made some of my famous
three bean salad.

224
00:08:44,622 --> 00:08:46,102
The secret...

225
00:08:46,189 --> 00:08:48,017
[whispers]:
I use four beans.

226
00:08:49,845 --> 00:08:51,978
Garbanzo.

227
00:08:52,065 --> 00:08:53,501
Shh.

228
00:08:53,588 --> 00:08:56,069
You ever look out at the ocean

229
00:08:56,156 --> 00:08:58,332
and think about how small
and insignificant you are?

230
00:08:58,419 --> 00:09:01,552
I don't need the ocean;
I can just call my mother.

231
00:09:01,639 --> 00:09:03,163
I almost died, Alan.

232
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:04,947
But the important thing is
you didn't.

233
00:09:05,034 --> 00:09:07,036
So, now you just have
to listen to your doctors,

234
00:09:07,123 --> 00:09:08,298
don't stress about anything
and relax.

235
00:09:08,385 --> 00:09:10,823
[shrill laughing]
[screams]

236
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:12,868
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

237
00:09:15,523 --> 00:09:17,568
Sorry.

238
00:09:17,655 --> 00:09:19,527
That was supposed to scare the
life out of trick-or-treaters,

239
00:09:19,614 --> 00:09:20,571
not you.

240
00:09:20,658 --> 00:09:22,095
This sucks!

241
00:09:22,182 --> 00:09:24,184
How am I the one
with a stent in my heart?

242
00:09:24,271 --> 00:09:26,055
I'm healthy, I-I'm fit.

243
00:09:26,142 --> 00:09:27,970
You sit in front
of the TV every night,

244
00:09:28,057 --> 00:09:29,929
shoveling a pint of ice cream
down your throat.

245
00:09:30,016 --> 00:09:31,626
Hey, I eat my feelings,

246
00:09:31,713 --> 00:09:33,802
and you are sending me
right back to the freezer.

247
00:09:33,889 --> 00:09:35,238
You know, it just goes to show,

248
00:09:35,325 --> 00:09:37,110
your life can end
in the blink of an eye.

249
00:09:37,197 --> 00:09:38,851
One day you're here,
the next day you're gone.

250
00:09:38,938 --> 00:09:40,722
That's why I live
by the philosophy

251
00:09:40,809 --> 00:09:43,246
"One day I'm here,
the next day I'm still here."

252
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:47,381
You know, if-if I would have
died, who would have missed me?

253
00:09:47,468 --> 00:09:50,210
What are you talking about?
I would, Berta would.

254
00:09:50,297 --> 00:09:52,821
A-And you just got an e-mail
from Netflix the other day

255
00:09:52,908 --> 00:09:54,562
that literally said,
"We miss you."

256
00:09:56,651 --> 00:10:00,220
You know, other than you guys
and my mom, I got nobody.

257
00:10:00,307 --> 00:10:01,874
At least you got Jake.

258
00:10:01,961 --> 00:10:04,050
Well, that's true.

259
00:10:04,137 --> 00:10:06,182
I'll always have
my little guy.

260
00:10:06,269 --> 00:10:08,097
Although, in his last e-mail,

261
00:10:08,184 --> 00:10:11,144
he, uh, asked me when the
Fourth of July was this year.

262
00:10:13,668 --> 00:10:16,236
But, yes, I'm very lucky.

263
00:10:16,323 --> 00:10:19,630
Do you know how much
I would give to have a kid

264
00:10:19,717 --> 00:10:22,198
who didn't understand
the concept of a calendar?

265
00:10:24,157 --> 00:10:25,680
All I have is money.

266
00:10:25,767 --> 00:10:27,682
Yeah.

267
00:10:27,769 --> 00:10:30,206
"Cause I wouldn't give up Jake
for a billion dollars.

268
00:10:33,209 --> 00:10:34,863
I got to make some changes.

269
00:10:34,950 --> 00:10:36,430
Changes are good.

270
00:10:36,517 --> 00:10:37,997
Uh, you know,
I remember when I switched

271
00:10:38,084 --> 00:10:39,607
from American Idolto The Voice.

272
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,262
My life turned around

273
00:10:42,349 --> 00:10:44,612
like Blake Shelton's chair.

274
00:10:44,699 --> 00:10:46,396
You know what?

275
00:10:46,483 --> 00:10:48,442
I want to have a kid of my own.

276
00:10:48,529 --> 00:10:50,313
What?

277
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,837
Yeah, I want something
to give my life meaning.

278
00:10:52,925 --> 00:10:55,405
I want somebody
I can love unconditionally.

279
00:10:55,492 --> 00:10:57,842
Someone I can teach,
someone I can nurture,

280
00:10:57,930 --> 00:10:59,453
someone I can leave
all this to.

281
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:01,194
Well...

282
00:11:01,281 --> 00:11:04,414
I mean, I don't know
what to say, except...

283
00:11:04,501 --> 00:11:06,286
Papa?

284
00:11:06,373 --> 00:11:08,070
♪ Men. ♪

285
00:11:11,682 --> 00:11:12,770
Have you thought
this through?

286
00:11:12,857 --> 00:11:14,163
Having a kid
is a lot of work.

287
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:17,427
Having you is
a lot of work.

288
00:11:17,514 --> 00:11:19,647
You know, having a child
would give my life meaning.

289
00:11:19,734 --> 00:11:21,257
Otherwise, all this
has been for nothing,

290
00:11:21,344 --> 00:11:22,693
and that's difficult
to accept.

291
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:24,086
You know
what's difficult?

292
00:11:24,173 --> 00:11:26,654
Removing a marble
your kid shoved up his nose.

293
00:11:26,741 --> 00:11:27,742
I did something like that.

294
00:11:27,829 --> 00:11:29,483
I jammed a penny up there.

295
00:11:29,570 --> 00:11:32,051
I was trying to get a gumball
to fall out of my butt.

296
00:11:32,138 --> 00:11:33,835
But a kid
is permanent.

297
00:11:33,922 --> 00:11:35,619
It's not like you're dating.

298
00:11:35,706 --> 00:11:37,621
You can't just stop calling
or change your number

299
00:11:37,708 --> 00:11:39,710
or fake your own death
because they annoy you.

300
00:11:39,797 --> 00:11:41,190
You do that to women?

301
00:11:41,277 --> 00:11:42,365
No, they do it to me.

302
00:11:44,454 --> 00:11:46,979
Look, I-I'm sorry if it feels
like I'm being negative,

303
00:11:47,066 --> 00:11:49,329
because the truth is,
you know, kids are amazing.

304
00:11:49,416 --> 00:11:51,592
But you just had
this big health scare,

305
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:53,507
and you're probably not
in the best frame of mind

306
00:11:53,594 --> 00:11:55,204
to make life decisions.

307
00:11:55,291 --> 00:11:57,815
I mean, this morning,
you cried at a beer commercial.

308
00:11:57,902 --> 00:12:01,254
Yeah, but the horse and
the puppy were best friends!

309
00:12:01,341 --> 00:12:02,995
Look,

310
00:12:03,082 --> 00:12:04,822
having a heart attack
didn't make me realize

311
00:12:04,909 --> 00:12:07,434
I want to have a kid,
it made me realize

312
00:12:07,521 --> 00:12:09,088
I don't want to live
another day without one.

313
00:12:09,175 --> 00:12:10,611
It was like a wake-up call.

314
00:12:10,698 --> 00:12:12,613
All right.

315
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:16,356
If you really want to do this,
I will be here to support you.

316
00:12:16,443 --> 00:12:18,097
From my room.

317
00:12:18,184 --> 00:12:21,274
Which, FYI, is way too drafty
to use as a nursery.

318
00:12:21,361 --> 00:12:23,450
Don't worry.
You're not going anywhere.

319
00:12:23,537 --> 00:12:24,538
Sweet! Let's get that kid!

320
00:12:25,843 --> 00:12:27,019
So, uh, who's the lucky lady

321
00:12:27,106 --> 00:12:28,977
who's gonna receive your seed?

322
00:12:29,064 --> 00:12:31,197
See, you just put
your creepy little finger

323
00:12:31,284 --> 00:12:32,328
right on the problem.

324
00:12:34,113 --> 00:12:36,289
I haven't exactly been
successful in love.

325
00:12:36,376 --> 00:12:40,162
It's like I'm running JavaScript
and women are running HTML5.

326
00:12:42,077 --> 00:12:44,166
Talking like that is part
of the problem, isn't it?

327
00:12:44,253 --> 00:12:45,776
Yeah.

328
00:12:45,863 --> 00:12:47,517
And it's weird, because
your package is perfect.

329
00:12:49,911 --> 00:12:52,609
And... and by "package,"
I don't mean your package,

330
00:12:52,696 --> 00:12:56,004
I mean your...
package.

331
00:12:57,571 --> 00:13:00,139
Although, that is also
a showstopper.

332
00:13:00,226 --> 00:13:03,098
Okay, I can't believe that
this is not the first time

333
00:13:03,185 --> 00:13:05,709
I've said this, but stop
looking at my penis.

334
00:13:08,495 --> 00:13:10,453
Well, now that
you've mentioned it,

335
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:13,500
I can't stop looking.

336
00:13:13,587 --> 00:13:15,415
It's like the elephant's trunk
in the room.

337
00:13:17,678 --> 00:13:19,506
Don't worry,
you'll-you'll find somebody.

338
00:13:19,593 --> 00:13:21,508
And, you know,
it goes without saying

339
00:13:21,595 --> 00:13:24,076
that if I could, I would
happily bear you a child.

340
00:13:25,729 --> 00:13:28,602
Okay, I wish all of this
had gone without saying.

341
00:13:28,689 --> 00:13:30,430
You doing okay?

342
00:13:30,517 --> 00:13:32,084
Yeah, I'm good.

343
00:13:32,171 --> 00:13:34,912
He wants to have a kid.
Now all he needs is a woman.

344
00:13:34,999 --> 00:13:36,871
Would you consider
a pregnant stripper?

345
00:13:38,002 --> 00:13:39,830
Uh, no.

346
00:13:39,917 --> 00:13:42,355
Well, that rules out
both my granddaughters.

347
00:13:48,926 --> 00:13:50,711
Morning. Did you
take your pills?

348
00:13:50,798 --> 00:13:52,495
Yep.

349
00:13:52,582 --> 00:13:54,671
Are you lying to me
or are you lying to yourself?

350
00:13:54,758 --> 00:13:55,672
[rattling]

351
00:13:57,413 --> 00:13:59,546
They're too big.
It's hard to swallow.

352
00:14:01,069 --> 00:14:02,375
If you say
"that's what she said,"

353
00:14:02,462 --> 00:14:03,941
I will kill you.

354
00:14:04,028 --> 00:14:05,421
You know what she said?

355
00:14:05,508 --> 00:14:07,510
"Take your pills.
I care about you."

356
00:14:07,597 --> 00:14:08,903
Fine.

357
00:14:08,990 --> 00:14:11,297
Do you know how long
it takes to get a baby?

358
00:14:11,384 --> 00:14:14,517
Well, I know it takes, uh,
five months of mood swings

359
00:14:14,604 --> 00:14:17,607
and four months of not
wanting to be touched.

360
00:14:17,694 --> 00:14:20,175
And who knows what my ex-wife
was going through.

361
00:14:20,262 --> 00:14:21,785
I was just
researching surrogacy,

362
00:14:21,872 --> 00:14:23,831
and they say that once
you choose a great candidate,

363
00:14:23,918 --> 00:14:25,267
it can take
up to three years

364
00:14:25,354 --> 00:14:26,834
before you have
a baby in your arm.

365
00:14:26,921 --> 00:14:28,836
I can't wait that long.

366
00:14:28,923 --> 00:14:30,968
I mean, who knows if I'll even
still want a kid by then?

367
00:14:31,055 --> 00:14:32,970
Tell me about it.

368
00:14:33,057 --> 00:14:35,843
Six months into Jake's life,
I was like, "Check, please!"

369
00:14:35,930 --> 00:14:37,758
I was kidding.

370
00:14:37,845 --> 00:14:39,586
As was I.

371
00:14:42,023 --> 00:14:43,546
Okay.

372
00:14:43,633 --> 00:14:45,679
I've narrowed down my options
to either adoption

373
00:14:45,766 --> 00:14:47,202
or seeing if
Brad and Angelina

374
00:14:47,289 --> 00:14:49,335
have an extra one
they could throw me.

375
00:14:49,422 --> 00:14:51,337
Uh, you know, if you really
want to adopt...

376
00:14:51,424 --> 00:14:54,427
For the last time, Alan,
I am not adopting you!

377
00:14:54,514 --> 00:14:56,168
But, Papa...

378
00:14:56,255 --> 00:14:58,170
Ah! All right.

379
00:15:01,956 --> 00:15:03,871
I already reached out
to a lawyer

380
00:15:03,958 --> 00:15:05,742
who specializes in adoption.

381
00:15:05,829 --> 00:15:08,005
Well, you're a perfect
candidate to adopt.

382
00:15:08,092 --> 00:15:10,356
I mean, you're highly educated,
you're likeable,

383
00:15:10,443 --> 00:15:12,184
uh, you have a stable
home environment...

384
00:15:12,271 --> 00:15:16,449
Financially secure,
no criminal record, handsome.

385
00:15:16,536 --> 00:15:20,148
I-I don't... I don't think
handsome really comes into play.

386
00:15:20,235 --> 00:15:22,672
Doesn't it, Alan?

387
00:15:22,759 --> 00:15:24,544
No, I don't think so.

388
00:15:27,068 --> 00:15:28,330
Doesn't it?

389
00:15:28,417 --> 00:15:30,158
You're being ridiculous.

390
00:15:30,245 --> 00:15:31,507
Am I?

391
00:15:33,683 --> 00:15:35,816
I will steal you a baby.

392
00:15:37,774 --> 00:15:39,646
♪ Men. ♪

393
00:15:39,733 --> 00:15:41,865
So, as you can see,
finances are not an issue.

394
00:15:41,952 --> 00:15:43,563
I have a lot of
extra free time,

395
00:15:43,650 --> 00:15:46,566
and I know I can provide
a loving, nurturing home.

396
00:15:47,741 --> 00:15:49,438
You okay?

397
00:15:49,525 --> 00:15:52,398
Are you?

398
00:15:52,485 --> 00:15:54,313
Seriously, do I need
to call someone?

399
00:15:55,444 --> 00:15:56,358
Never mind.

400
00:15:56,445 --> 00:15:57,881
What's important is that

401
00:15:57,968 --> 00:15:59,231
I will coach the hell
out of the Braves.

402
00:15:59,318 --> 00:16:01,058
Excuse me?

403
00:16:01,145 --> 00:16:02,799
It'll be the name of
my son's tee-ball team.

404
00:16:02,886 --> 00:16:04,540
Pretty Pink Ponies,
if it's a girl.

405
00:16:04,627 --> 00:16:06,586
You know what,
if my son wants to play

406
00:16:06,673 --> 00:16:08,718
for the Pretty Pink Ponies,
then so be it.

407
00:16:08,805 --> 00:16:10,503
Tolerant.

408
00:16:11,591 --> 00:16:12,983
Well, Mr. Schmidt,

409
00:16:13,070 --> 00:16:14,855
you are obviously
more than qualified.

410
00:16:14,942 --> 00:16:16,073
Thank you.

411
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:17,118
That said, I'd start looking

412
00:16:17,205 --> 00:16:18,989
at Golden Retriever puppies,

413
00:16:19,076 --> 00:16:20,252
"cause there's no way
you're getting a baby.

414
00:16:20,339 --> 00:16:21,818
Well, I don't understand.

415
00:16:21,905 --> 00:16:23,385
You just said that
I'm more than qualified.

416
00:16:23,472 --> 00:16:24,386
And you are.

417
00:16:24,473 --> 00:16:26,083
But you're a single guy,

418
00:16:26,170 --> 00:16:28,085
and the system is really geared
towards married couples.

419
00:16:28,172 --> 00:16:29,739
That's racist.

420
00:16:29,826 --> 00:16:32,351
Uh, no, it's not.

421
00:16:32,438 --> 00:16:33,700
Then it's sexist.

422
00:16:33,787 --> 00:16:35,354
Nope.

423
00:16:35,441 --> 00:16:37,878
Well, it's some kind of "sist."

424
00:16:37,965 --> 00:16:39,793
Look, I'm not saying
it's impossible, okay?

425
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:41,795
Just that it's difficult.

426
00:16:41,882 --> 00:16:44,232
You're in line behind families
that already have children,

427
00:16:44,319 --> 00:16:45,842
married couples, single women...

428
00:16:45,929 --> 00:16:46,887
Anyone else?

429
00:16:46,974 --> 00:16:48,584
What, sweat shops? Circuses?

430
00:16:48,671 --> 00:16:50,107
The Vienna Boys" Choir?

431
00:16:50,194 --> 00:16:52,284
Look, I wish
I had better news, okay?

432
00:16:52,371 --> 00:16:54,590
If you were married,
this would be a slam dunk.

433
00:16:54,677 --> 00:16:56,375
Okay, you don't get it.

434
00:16:56,462 --> 00:16:58,768
Marriage is not
an option for me.

435
00:16:58,855 --> 00:17:01,118
Okay, I understand
you're frustrated...

436
00:17:01,205 --> 00:17:03,120
No, what's frustrating
is that every woman I meet

437
00:17:03,207 --> 00:17:04,426
runs screaming from me!

438
00:17:04,513 --> 00:17:05,601
I was married before
and she left me

439
00:17:05,688 --> 00:17:07,081
and I tried to commit suicide.

440
00:17:07,168 --> 00:17:08,430
Don't write that down.

441
00:17:08,517 --> 00:17:09,736
Why are you
writing that down?

442
00:17:09,823 --> 00:17:11,128
No, no...

443
00:17:11,215 --> 00:17:12,391
Then I proposed
to two other women,

444
00:17:12,478 --> 00:17:13,696
and they both shot me down.

445
00:17:13,783 --> 00:17:15,219
I am incapable of maintaining

446
00:17:15,307 --> 00:17:17,091
a long-term relationship
with anybody.

447
00:17:17,178 --> 00:17:18,745
Now, give me a frickin" baby!

448
00:17:18,832 --> 00:17:20,137
Okay.

449
00:17:20,224 --> 00:17:21,269
I think we're done here.

450
00:17:21,356 --> 00:17:22,966
No, we are
not done here!

451
00:17:23,053 --> 00:17:25,055
I almost died wearing
a bedazzled jumpsuit

452
00:17:25,142 --> 00:17:26,318
and my life
needs meaning.

453
00:17:26,405 --> 00:17:28,015
Stop writing
things down!

454
00:17:34,238 --> 00:17:35,675
Mmm.

455
00:17:35,762 --> 00:17:37,285
Hey, how'd it go? What kind of world...

456
00:17:37,372 --> 00:17:38,112
Uh-oh.

457
00:17:38,199 --> 00:17:39,853
are we living in

458
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:42,551
where any two high school kids
with a broken condom

459
00:17:42,638 --> 00:17:44,771
can screw behind
an Applebee's Dumpster,

460
00:17:44,858 --> 00:17:46,686
have a baby,
give it up for adoption,

461
00:17:46,773 --> 00:17:50,603
but not have it go to
an adult who is upstanding,

462
00:17:50,690 --> 00:17:53,649
responsible,
and, might I add, handsome...

463
00:17:55,434 --> 00:17:57,261
simply because
every woman I meet

464
00:17:57,349 --> 00:17:58,785
eventually grows to loathe me?

465
00:17:58,872 --> 00:18:00,482
And because of that,
the Pretty Pink Ponies

466
00:18:00,569 --> 00:18:02,832
will not have a tee-ball coach!

467
00:18:02,919 --> 00:18:04,617
So it didn't go well?

468
00:18:04,704 --> 00:18:06,227
[mocking]:
No, it did not go well.

469
00:18:06,314 --> 00:18:09,273
All right, well, uh,
first things first.

470
00:18:09,361 --> 00:18:11,232
Uh, how about we get
you a little Zin

471
00:18:11,319 --> 00:18:12,625
to calm your nerves?

472
00:18:12,712 --> 00:18:13,800
It's just not fair.

473
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:14,888
I know, I know.

474
00:18:14,975 --> 00:18:16,629
Uh, thank you.

475
00:18:16,716 --> 00:18:18,674
Just because I'm single,
I'm not a fit parent?

476
00:18:18,761 --> 00:18:20,023
Did they say that to you?

477
00:18:21,198 --> 00:18:23,810
That's how I felt.

478
00:18:23,897 --> 00:18:25,072
Apparently, the whole system

479
00:18:25,159 --> 00:18:27,161
is geared towards
married couples.

480
00:18:27,248 --> 00:18:28,597
And-and single guys
are not welcome.

481
00:18:28,684 --> 00:18:30,382
Like a Studio City
swingers party.

482
00:18:30,469 --> 00:18:32,732
Exactly.

483
00:18:32,819 --> 00:18:34,734
Wait, what?

484
00:18:34,821 --> 00:18:37,084
Nothing. So, uh, did you
tell her everything?

485
00:18:37,171 --> 00:18:39,391
I mean, how you're successful,
you're warm, you're caring...

486
00:18:39,478 --> 00:18:41,131
I told her everything. Did you give her the smile?

487
00:18:41,218 --> 00:18:42,959
Of course I gave
her the smile.

488
00:18:43,046 --> 00:18:44,483
She thought I was
having a stroke.

489
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:47,050
So nothing worked?

490
00:18:47,137 --> 00:18:49,139
No. Even if I hadn't been
escorted out by security,

491
00:18:49,226 --> 00:18:51,403
I still don't think
they were giving me a kid.

492
00:18:51,490 --> 00:18:53,317
Wow, I'm, uh...
I'm really sorry.

493
00:18:53,405 --> 00:18:55,145
You know, it's ridiculous.

494
00:18:55,232 --> 00:18:57,757
Why-why are married people
automatically better parents?

495
00:18:57,844 --> 00:19:00,237
My mom was married six
times; didn't help her.

496
00:19:00,324 --> 00:19:02,805
See, and I would've been
a great dad.

497
00:19:02,892 --> 00:19:04,154
I would've played
catch with him,

498
00:19:04,241 --> 00:19:05,765
I would've read to him,

499
00:19:05,852 --> 00:19:07,244
I would've waited
till he went to sleep

500
00:19:07,331 --> 00:19:09,377
before I smoked pot.

501
00:19:09,464 --> 00:19:11,945
Already got my mom beat.

502
00:19:12,032 --> 00:19:13,425
But-but you shouldn't give up.

503
00:19:13,512 --> 00:19:14,861
I mean, you might
still find somebody.

504
00:19:14,948 --> 00:19:16,297
No, I don't want
to marry somebody

505
00:19:16,384 --> 00:19:17,777
just to marry somebody.

506
00:19:17,864 --> 00:19:19,387
It's got to be the right person.

507
00:19:19,474 --> 00:19:20,954
Ooh, or Mila Kunis.

508
00:19:22,303 --> 00:19:23,347
I get it.

509
00:19:23,435 --> 00:19:25,001
That's hard to find.

510
00:19:25,088 --> 00:19:26,525
[timer dings]Oh, that's my banana bread.

511
00:19:26,612 --> 00:19:27,874
I love your banana bread.

512
00:19:27,961 --> 00:19:29,223
I know.

513
00:19:29,310 --> 00:19:30,746
I made it hoping
we could celebrate,

514
00:19:30,833 --> 00:19:33,401
but it works on
a sad tummy, too.

515
00:19:34,489 --> 00:19:36,535
Oh, what would I do without you?

516
00:19:36,622 --> 00:19:38,885
I hope you never have
to find out. [chuckles]

517
