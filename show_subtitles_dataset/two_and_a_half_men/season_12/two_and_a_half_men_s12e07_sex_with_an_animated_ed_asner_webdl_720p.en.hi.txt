1
00:00:05,764 --> 00:00:06,931
Ugh.

2
00:00:06,933 --> 00:00:08,566
How is it possible

3
00:00:08,568 --> 00:00:11,569
That kids weigh twice as
much when they're asleep?

4
00:00:11,571 --> 00:00:12,737
I know.

5
00:00:12,739 --> 00:00:14,739
And he should weigh less
after his little mishap

6
00:00:14,741 --> 00:00:16,507
On the spinning teacups.

7
00:00:16,509 --> 00:00:18,509
Yeah.

8
00:00:18,511 --> 00:00:20,912
Felt bad for that girl
in the cinderella costume

9
00:00:20,914 --> 00:00:22,713
In the cup behind us.

10
00:00:22,715 --> 00:00:25,716
She was right in
the splash zone.

11
00:00:25,718 --> 00:00:27,718
(groans)
I'm exhausted.

12
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:29,353
Me, too.

13
00:00:29,355 --> 00:00:32,356
I'm also sticky and dirty
and sweaty and slimy.

14
00:00:32,358 --> 00:00:35,760
I'm like the seven dwarfs
of disgusting.

15
00:00:35,762 --> 00:00:38,362
Ugh, I should not have eaten
that funnel cake.

16
00:00:38,364 --> 00:00:39,964
(groans)

17
00:00:39,966 --> 00:00:41,566
Well, I see
your funnel cake

18
00:00:41,568 --> 00:00:45,703
And raise you a deep-fried
snickers stuffed into a twinkie.

19
00:00:45,705 --> 00:00:48,573
I think I blacked out briefly.

20
00:00:48,575 --> 00:00:50,641
(both groaning)

21
00:00:52,377 --> 00:00:55,113
Is being a dad always
this tiring?

22
00:00:55,115 --> 00:00:58,950
These are the best
moments of your life.

23
00:00:58,952 --> 00:01:01,619
And they are over
so fast.

24
00:01:01,621 --> 00:01:03,621
Seems like only yesterday,

25
00:01:03,623 --> 00:01:06,791
Jake was holding my hand
in the haunted house.

26
00:01:06,793 --> 00:01:10,628
Now he's half a world away
in the army,

27
00:01:10,630 --> 00:01:13,631
Wondering if a "dishonorable
discharge" is something you get

28
00:01:13,633 --> 00:01:14,899
From a dirty geisha.

29
00:01:14,901 --> 00:01:16,968

Louis and I,
we're playing hide and seek.

57
00:02:38,685 --> 00:02:40,484
He's under his bed, hiding

58
00:02:40,486 --> 00:02:43,421
And I'm in the kitchen,
seeking sleep.

59
00:02:43,423 --> 00:02:45,022

60
00:02:45,024 --> 00:02:47,825

Except crackheads have
better toilet aim.

65
00:02:56,169 --> 00:02:58,569
No, no, this isn't about
being tired.

Hey, I didn't think I could live

68
00:03:02,942 --> 00:03:04,108
In a malibu beach house
for free,

69
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:06,577
But I figured it out.

70
00:03:06,579 --> 00:03:09,180
Well, I don't know
if I can figure this out.

71
00:03:09,182 --> 00:03:11,015
I mean, th-this kid
has bounced around

72
00:03:11,017 --> 00:03:13,084
The foster care system
his whole life.

73
00:03:13,086 --> 00:03:15,119
I mean, I-I don't know
what he needs.

74
00:03:15,121 --> 00:03:16,287
I mean, does he need structure?

75
00:03:16,289 --> 00:03:17,288
Does he need freedom?

76
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:20,224
Does he need medication?

77
00:03:20,226 --> 00:03:24,028
I should have asked that
before they dropped him off.

78
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:26,097
All he needs is
your love and support.

79
00:03:26,099 --> 00:03:27,732
(imitates alan mockingly)

80
00:03:27,734 --> 00:03:29,533
That's a bunch of crap.

81
00:03:29,535 --> 00:03:31,936
Walden, every parent goes
through this.

82
00:03:31,938 --> 00:03:33,938
B-but you're actually
doing a great job.

83
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:36,941
You're just overwhelmed
because this is all so new,

84
00:03:36,943 --> 00:03:39,110
A-and you're trying to be
everything to him all the time.

85
00:03:39,112 --> 00:03:40,945
You know, full-time dad,
full-time playmate.

86
00:03:40,947 --> 00:03:42,413
You have to give
yourself a break.

87
00:03:42,415 --> 00:03:43,414
How?

88
00:03:43,416 --> 00:03:44,815
He's 24-7.

89
00:03:44,817 --> 00:03:47,418
He's like the energizer bunny.

90
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:49,820
You know why you never met
the energizer bunny's dad?

91
00:03:49,822 --> 00:03:52,056
'cause one night,
he went out for cigarettes,

92
00:03:52,058 --> 00:03:55,393
And he just kept going
and going and going.

93
00:03:55,395 --> 00:03:58,963
One thing that'll help
is getting louis some friends.

94
00:03:58,965 --> 00:04:00,231
Playdates.

95
00:04:00,233 --> 00:04:01,799
They chase each other
around for hours,

96
00:04:01,801 --> 00:04:03,801
Eventually they pass out
like work dogs.

97
00:04:03,803 --> 00:04:05,970
Kid'll be in
bed by 8:00,

98
00:04:05,972 --> 00:04:07,805
Then it's you, me,
a bowl of popcorn

99
00:04:07,807 --> 00:04:09,840
And binge-watching
the good wife.

100
00:04:09,842 --> 00:04:11,442
Okay, so what?

101
00:04:11,444 --> 00:04:13,444
So, I just...
I'll just google a place

102
00:04:13,446 --> 00:04:15,646

cute six-year-old.

103
00:04:15,648 --> 00:04:17,014
Oh, yeah. No.

104
00:04:17,016 --> 00:04:19,850

How'd you snag him?

140
00:05:36,162 --> 00:05:39,330

life, and I took care of him.

by houses like this

178
00:06:54,774 --> 00:06:56,140
And think the people
on the decks were just looking

179

Down their noses at everyone,
feeling all superior.

182
00:07:03,449 --> 00:07:05,249
'cause he said we never used it.

183
00:07:05,251 --> 00:07:07,685
Using that logic,
we should sell his penis.

184
00:07:07,687 --> 00:07:09,687
(laughs)

185
00:07:09,689 --> 00:07:11,689
Classic julie.

186
00:07:11,691 --> 00:07:13,958
Hey, w-we should make
this a regular thing.

187
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:15,526
(thudding, shattering)

188
00:07:15,528 --> 00:07:18,195
Oh. Yeah, next time we'll
do it at one of your houses.

189
00:07:19,331 --> 00:07:21,332
Hey, uh, louis, is
everything okay?

190
00:07:21,334 --> 00:07:22,967
Over.

191
00:07:22,969 --> 00:07:25,970
Louis:
Lego tower fell over.

192
00:07:25,972 --> 00:07:27,538
Uh, you didn't
say "over."

193
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:29,373
Over.

194
00:07:29,375 --> 00:07:31,375
I said the lego tower fell over.

195
00:07:31,377 --> 00:07:32,209
Over.

196
00:07:32,211 --> 00:07:35,045
You're so good
with him. Over.

197
00:07:35,047 --> 00:07:38,682
Actually, I-I feel like I
have no idea what I'm doing.

198
00:07:38,684 --> 00:07:40,117
Join the club.

199
00:07:40,119 --> 00:07:41,886
Parenting's
like a yoga class.

200
00:07:41,888 --> 00:07:43,487
You just do what
everybody else is doing

201
00:07:43,489 --> 00:07:45,389
And try not to laugh
when someone farts.

202
00:07:48,326 --> 00:07:51,128
Okay, so all the kids are
playing in louis' room.

203
00:07:51,130 --> 00:07:53,130
Well, technically, three
of them are playing together,

204
00:07:53,132 --> 00:07:55,299
And louis is in the corner,
coloring by himself.

205
00:07:55,301 --> 00:07:56,500
That's perfectly normal.

206
00:07:56,502 --> 00:07:58,869
The parenting books call it
"parallel play."

207
00:07:58,871 --> 00:08:00,871
Oh, that's good
to know.

208
00:08:00,873 --> 00:08:02,706
So, in high school,
I wasn't such a weirdo.

209
00:08:02,708 --> 00:08:05,709
I was just a parallel player.

210
00:08:05,711 --> 00:08:08,445
My sex life with my first wife
was a lot of parallel play.

211
00:08:09,648 --> 00:08:10,848
Just give louis time.

212
00:08:10,850 --> 00:08:12,383
Remember, this is
all new for him.

213
00:08:12,385 --> 00:08:13,918
Kind of like
learning on my honeymoon

214
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:16,253
That I wasn't going to have sex
was all new for me.

215
00:08:16,255 --> 00:08:18,255
You know, I just want him
to have friends.

216
00:08:18,257 --> 00:08:20,858
You know, like a couple girls,
and a couple boys.

217
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:22,259
He's gonna be fine.

218
00:08:22,261 --> 00:08:24,261
In the meantime,
I have made some friends

219
00:08:24,263 --> 00:08:26,864
Who have welcomed me
into the secret world of women.

220
00:08:26,866 --> 00:08:28,699
I am this close to discovering
everything about them.

221
00:08:28,701 --> 00:08:31,035
What they like, what
they don't like.

222
00:08:31,037 --> 00:08:33,237
And where they don't like it.

223
00:08:33,239 --> 00:08:36,273
We're supposed to be here
helping louis make friends.

224
00:08:36,275 --> 00:08:38,108
Oh, please, I see
how you look at laurel.

225
00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:40,611
It's the same way I look at
a five dollar bill in a tip jar

226
00:08:40,613 --> 00:08:42,246
I think I can swap out
for a single.

227
00:08:42,248 --> 00:08:44,248
Okay, what are you
talking about?

228
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:46,517
That is louis'
friend's mom.

229
00:08:46,519 --> 00:08:48,719
And, yes,
we get along great.

230
00:08:48,721 --> 00:08:50,521
And, yes,
she's pretty and nice.

231
00:08:50,523 --> 00:08:52,723
And, yes, she used to be
a gymnast and can still

232
00:08:52,725 --> 00:08:53,891
Put her legs
behind her head.

233
00:08:53,893 --> 00:08:55,092
And she is out there.

234
00:08:55,094 --> 00:08:58,095
So why am I still standing here,
talking to you?

235
00:08:58,097 --> 00:09:01,265
I can put my legs behind my
head, but you'll never see it.

236
00:09:03,268 --> 00:09:05,269
♪ men. ♪

237
00:09:05,271 --> 00:09:06,870
He was a really
nice guy,
mm-hmm.

238
00:09:06,872 --> 00:09:08,439
And I liked hanging
out with him,

239
00:09:08,441 --> 00:09:09,740
But when we got
to the bedroom,

240
00:09:09,742 --> 00:09:11,742
He was just, well...

241
00:09:11,744 --> 00:09:14,878
If he were a candy bar,
he'd be the fun size.

242
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,880
There's nothing fun
about that.

243
00:09:16,882 --> 00:09:20,284
Yeah, nothing worse
than a small penis.

244
00:09:20,286 --> 00:09:22,353
But, seriously, how
small is too small?

245
00:09:23,755 --> 00:09:25,155
Alan, you are a riot.

246
00:09:25,157 --> 00:09:27,224
We should hang out
with you more often.

247
00:09:27,226 --> 00:09:29,426
Hey, what do you
say, we all go out

248
00:09:29,428 --> 00:09:30,628
This Saturday for
a girls night?

249
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:32,630
You know, get a limo,
go out dancing,

00:09:32,632 --> 00:09:34,098
Wear our sluttiest outfits.

251
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:36,667
Julie, you can wear what
you're wearing now.

00:09:36,669 --> 00:09:39,403
Uh, I'm bad.

253
00:09:39,405 --> 00:09:41,405
Should we go check
on the kids?

254
00:09:41,407 --> 00:09:42,773
Are you kidding?

255
00:09:42,775 --> 00:09:45,776
They're set up with pizza,
popsicles and the lego movie.

00:09:49,081 --> 00:09:52,082
Yeah, I've seen that
movie, like, five times.

259
00:09:52,084 --> 00:09:54,351
I should really watch it
with louis at some point.

260
00:09:54,353 --> 00:09:55,786
I haven't seen a movie

261
00:09:55,788 --> 00:09:58,355
That wasn't for a kid
in forever.

262
00:09:58,357 --> 00:10:00,357
The other night
I actually had a sex dream

263
00:10:00,359 --> 00:10:02,092
About an animated character.

264
00:10:02,094 --> 00:10:04,461
Whoa...

265
00:10:04,463 --> 00:10:05,462
Prince charming?

266
00:10:05,464 --> 00:10:08,432
The old guy from up.

267
00:10:10,435 --> 00:10:13,504
And, sadly, it was the only sex
I've had in two years.

268
00:10:13,506 --> 00:10:15,939
Well, if it meant a
whole night's sleep,

269
00:10:15,941 --> 00:10:19,510
I'd have sex with an
animated ed asner, too.

270
00:10:19,512 --> 00:10:21,145
You think you're tired now.

271
00:10:21,147 --> 00:10:23,147
You missed the hardest years.

272
00:10:23,149 --> 00:10:26,350
The-the... The picky eating,
the tantrums, the bed-wetting.

273
00:10:26,352 --> 00:10:29,520
Okay, to be fair, I get
all of that with alan.

274
00:10:30,955 --> 00:10:33,357
You guys are a great team.
Hmm.

275
00:10:33,359 --> 00:10:34,892
The only thing
my ex would help with

276
00:10:34,894 --> 00:10:36,827
Was driving the babysitter home.

277
00:10:36,829 --> 00:10:38,395
She'd have the kids
in bed by 8:00

278
00:10:38,397 --> 00:10:40,397
And my husband in bed by 10:00.

279
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:43,300
Oh... That's horrible.

280
00:10:43,302 --> 00:10:44,968
Is she a good sitter?
'cause we're looking.

281
00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:46,870
Sorry.

282
00:10:46,872 --> 00:10:49,707
Without that jerk of an ex,

283
00:10:49,709 --> 00:10:51,308
I wouldn't have lily,

284
00:10:51,310 --> 00:10:53,477
And even at six years old,
she's my best friend.

285

I hope I get there

I hope I stay there with lily.

288
00:10:58,851 --> 00:11:00,651
I'm afraid that by the time
she's a teenager,

289
00:11:00,653 --> 00:11:02,586
She'll be like,
"mom, you're 100!

290
00:11:02,588 --> 00:11:04,421
Nobody believes
I'm your sister!"

smart and flexible as you?

No, uh, "too far"

397
00:14:51,150 --> 00:14:52,749

Uh, well, I went on the internet

401
00:15:02,061 --> 00:15:04,328
And I've narrowed it down
to either the flu,

402
00:15:04,330 --> 00:15:07,431
Rickets
or early-onset menopause.

I don't sleep,

Does he even want to stay here?

00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:29,579
I mean, this is the most
terrifying thing I've ever done.

451
00:16:29,581 --> 00:16:31,882
And— this is scarier than
when I bought the big iphone

452

You have to worry
about animated penises.

460
00:16:49,934 --> 00:16:51,701
I should have never
told you that.

461
00:16:51,703 --> 00:16:53,603

482
00:17:43,588 --> 00:17:45,755
His brain knows,

483
00:17:45,757 --> 00:17:48,792
But his heart may not.

484
00:17:48,794 --> 00:17:49,893
Here-here-here,
here's the thing.

485
00:17:49,895 --> 00:17:51,261
Here's the thing:
Alan is...

486
00:17:51,263 --> 00:17:52,729
He's my best
friend, okay?

487
00:17:52,731 --> 00:17:54,131
And-and he married me
as a favor

488
00:17:54,133 --> 00:17:56,733
So it would be easier
to adopt louis.

489
00:17:56,735 --> 00:17:57,801
Okay? And-and...

490
00:17:57,803 --> 00:17:59,903
Well, I mean...
The fact that you

491
00:17:59,905 --> 00:18:00,904
Married your
best friend

492
00:18:00,906 --> 00:18:03,406
So that you could
adopt louis is..

493
00:18:03,408 --> 00:18:05,842
Actually
very sweet.

494
00:18:05,844 --> 00:18:08,245
So...

495
00:18:10,848 --> 00:18:12,816
You're not
mad at me?

496
00:18:12,818 --> 00:18:14,985
Hakuna matata.

497
00:18:16,787 --> 00:18:19,422
That's my philosophy.

498
00:18:21,926 --> 00:18:24,094
So...

499
00:18:25,696 --> 00:18:27,531
Can we kiss again?
Yeah.

500
00:18:29,667 --> 00:18:32,202
It's been so long since
I've kissed a man.
Oh...

501
00:18:32,204 --> 00:18:34,204
I wish I could say
the same thing.

502
00:18:35,206 --> 00:18:38,475
Julie, your boobs look
great in that blouse.

503
00:18:38,477 --> 00:18:39,976
I am so jealous.

504
00:18:39,978 --> 00:18:41,344
Thanks to my kids,

505
00:18:41,346 --> 00:18:44,014
Mine went from 34b

506
00:18:44,016 --> 00:18:46,016
I like your boobs.

507
00:18:46,018 --> 00:18:46,816
I don't know.

508
00:18:46,818 --> 00:18:48,051
What do you think, alan,

509
00:18:48,053 --> 00:18:49,186
Should I get 'em done?

510
00:18:49,188 --> 00:18:50,787
Oh, well, I'm no expert.

511
00:18:50,789 --> 00:18:52,022
I-I think they're lovely.

512
00:18:52,024 --> 00:18:53,223
Are you sure?

513
00:18:53,225 --> 00:18:54,457
Oh, my!

514
00:18:54,459 --> 00:18:56,159
You just did that.

515
00:18:56,161 --> 00:18:58,728
Um, you guys, I-I think there's
something I should tell you...

516
00:18:58,730 --> 00:18:59,963
He has nothing
to compare them with.

517
00:18:59,965 --> 00:19:01,031
Here.

518
00:19:03,734 --> 00:19:06,303
You guys are my best friends.

519
00:19:06,305 --> 00:19:07,537
Aw!
Aw!

520
00:19:07,539 --> 00:19:09,539
Okay, okay.

521
00:19:09,541 --> 00:19:11,908
I-I know you haven't
done this in a while,

522
00:19:11,910 --> 00:19:13,910
So I don't want
to go too fast,

523
00:19:13,912 --> 00:19:15,345
But do you want
to go up to my...

524
00:19:15,347 --> 00:19:16,179
Let's go.

525
00:19:16,181 --> 00:19:18,548
Oh.

526
00:19:18,550 --> 00:19:21,251
Louis (over walkie-talkie):
Walden?

527
00:19:21,253 --> 00:19:22,786
Can you come here?

528
00:19:24,155 --> 00:19:26,389
He didn't say "over,"
so it doesn't count.

529
00:19:27,892 --> 00:19:29,059
Oh, go check on him.

530
00:19:29,061 --> 00:19:30,594
It's fine.

531
00:19:30,596 --> 00:19:32,696
I've waited for two years,
I can wait a little bit longer.
