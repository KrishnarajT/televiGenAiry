00:06:46,982 --> 00:06:48,723
Wow!

180
00:06:48,810 --> 00:06:49,985
Look at you!

181
00:06:50,072 --> 00:06:52,117
So very pregnant.

182
00:06:52,204 --> 00:06:53,292
Coat.

183
00:06:53,379 --> 00:06:55,251
I know.

184
00:06:55,338 --> 00:06:57,296
I haven't seen
my feet since July.

185
00:06:57,383 --> 00:06:59,342
Am I wearing matching shoes?

186
00:06:59,429 --> 00:07:00,778
Um...

187
00:07:00,865 --> 00:07:02,301
actually, no.

188
00:07:02,388 --> 00:07:04,260
Uh, but you know what, it works.
It's cute.

189
00:07:04,347 --> 00:07:05,565
Um, please sit.

190
00:07:05,652 --> 00:07:07,176
Yeah, please.
How you feeling?

191
00:07:07,263 --> 00:07:08,873
My ankles are swollen,

192
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:11,223
my back hurts,
and forget about my breasts.

193
00:07:11,310 --> 00:07:14,183
I haven't even noticed,
you know, "cause I'm gay.

194
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:15,619
That's... [clears throat]

195
00:07:15,706 --> 00:07:17,752
That's my rainbow warrior.

196
00:07:17,839 --> 00:07:20,145
Always waving his flag.

197
00:07:20,232 --> 00:07:22,191
Even when it relates
to nothing.

198
00:07:22,278 --> 00:07:26,064
Um, so, uh,
tell us about Kathy.

199
00:07:26,151 --> 00:07:28,023
I think the first thing
you should know about me

200
00:07:28,110 --> 00:07:30,460
is this is not representative
of who I am.

201
00:07:30,547 --> 00:07:31,678
See, I just graduated

202
00:07:31,766 --> 00:07:33,332
from UCLA.

203
00:07:33,419 --> 00:07:36,727
The baby is a result
of a spring break trip to Vegas.

204
00:07:36,814 --> 00:07:39,208
Ah. I guess what happens
in Vegas

205
00:07:39,295 --> 00:07:40,775
stays in Kathy.

206
00:07:42,515 --> 00:07:44,996
Yep, took me about six weeks
to figure out

207
00:07:45,083 --> 00:07:46,563
that my morning sickness

208
00:07:46,650 --> 00:07:48,870
wasn't just
a really bad hangover.

209
00:07:48,957 --> 00:07:50,306
Well, we all make mistakes.

210
00:07:50,393 --> 00:07:52,351
One morning,
I woke up married to this one.

211
00:07:52,438 --> 00:07:54,614
[laughs]

212
00:07:54,701 --> 00:07:57,748
See, bottom line, this wasn't
part of my five-year plan.

213
00:07:57,835 --> 00:07:59,968
You know, law school,
clerk for a judge,

214
00:08:00,055 --> 00:08:01,273
start my own practice.

215
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,884
Wow, that's-that's impressive.

216
00:08:02,971 --> 00:08:04,842
Uh, Alan's son, Jake,

217
00:08:04,929 --> 00:08:07,018
had a five-year plan
for the tenth grade.

218
00:08:07,105 --> 00:08:08,498
[chuckles]

219
00:08:08,585 --> 00:08:10,152
See, that's why I liked
your profile.

220
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:12,197
You have parenting experience.

221
00:08:12,284 --> 00:08:14,112
Your sense of humor
came through.

222
00:08:14,199 --> 00:08:16,245
And I kind of love
that you're gay.

223
00:08:16,332 --> 00:08:18,203
Not as much as we do.

224
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:19,552
Right, Wally Bear?

225
00:08:19,639 --> 00:08:21,250
That's right, Alley Cat.

226
00:08:23,513 --> 00:08:26,168
Even though I'm not gonna
be part of the baby's life,

227
00:08:26,255 --> 00:08:28,561
I like the idea of being
the only mom.

228
00:08:28,648 --> 00:08:30,607
I can totally understand that.

229
00:08:30,694 --> 00:08:33,479
Probably because my mom was an
ice-cold, sharp-tongue alcoholic

230
00:08:33,566 --> 00:08:36,787
who preferred shopping and spas
over spending time with me.

231
00:08:36,874 --> 00:08:39,094
And I can
totally understand that.

232
00:08:39,181 --> 00:08:41,226
So, tell me about you.

233
00:08:41,313 --> 00:08:43,576
What made you guys decide
to start a family?

234
00:08:43,663 --> 00:08:46,144
Uh, well, raising my son

235
00:08:46,231 --> 00:08:48,886
was one of the greatest
experiences of my life,

236
00:08:48,973 --> 00:08:50,888
and I just wanted Walden
to feel that same joy.

237
00:08:52,629 --> 00:08:54,413
Yeah, I mean, for me
it's a couple reasons.

238
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,894
I-I felt like something
was missing in my life,

239
00:08:56,981 --> 00:08:59,201
and I wanted to give back,

240
00:08:59,288 --> 00:09:02,987
and having a kid will allow me
to drive in the carpool lane.

241
00:09:03,074 --> 00:09:04,380
[laughs]

242
00:09:04,467 --> 00:09:06,948
It's nice to laugh again.

243
00:09:07,035 --> 00:09:09,124
Except I just peed a little
on your sofa.

244
00:09:09,211 --> 00:09:10,908
I'll get you something.

245
00:09:10,995 --> 00:09:12,910
Oh, uh, actually,
I got something right here.

246
00:09:14,042 --> 00:09:15,434

248
00:09:16,696 --> 00:09:17,784
The baby just kicked.

249
00:09:17,872 --> 00:09:19,090
I felt it.

250
00:09:19,177 --> 00:09:20,526
Oh, looks like someone's got

251
00:09:20,613 --> 00:09:22,267
a little soccer star in there.

252
00:09:22,354 --> 00:09:24,226
God, you smell good.

253
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:28,665
Alan, you want to come up
for some air?

254
00:09:28,752 --> 00:09:29,971
Oh, sorry.

255
00:09:30,058 --> 00:09:31,973
Just got excited. [chuckles]

256
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:33,626
About the baby.

257
00:09:33,713 --> 00:09:35,367
Sure.

258
00:09:35,454 --> 00:09:36,934
So, uh, Kathy,

259
00:09:37,021 --> 00:09:39,154
uh, do you know
if it's a boy or a girl?

260
00:09:39,241 --> 00:09:40,982
I don't, but your profile said

261
00:09:41,069 --> 00:09:42,984
you didn't have
a gender preference, right?

262
00:09:43,071 --> 00:09:44,333
Oh, that's right.

263
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:46,639
Just like me in my 20s.
[chuckles]

264
00:09:46,726 --> 00:09:48,946
You guys crack me up.

265
00:09:49,033 --> 00:09:51,035
You're gonna make great dads.

266
00:09:51,122 --> 00:09:53,385
Oh, world's greatest, according
the coffee mugs I bought.

267
00:09:53,472 --> 00:09:57,737
Well, that's good,
because I made up my mind.

268
00:09:57,824 --> 00:09:59,304
I want you to have my baby.

269
00:09:59,391 --> 00:10:00,871
No! Yes.

270
00:10:00,958 --> 00:10:02,568
Oh, my God!
You did not just say that!

271
00:10:02,655 --> 00:10:03,830
You bitch!

272
00:10:04,919 --> 00:10:06,137
Thank you, Kathy.

273
00:10:06,224 --> 00:10:07,486
Thank you, Vegas.

274
00:10:07,573 --> 00:10:09,532
Thank you, broken condom.

275
00:10:09,619 --> 00:10:11,186
Well, you can thank
two-for-one tequila shots

276
00:10:11,273 --> 00:10:13,362
at the Tropicana. [chuckles]

277
00:10:13,449 --> 00:10:14,798
Let's not forget
this little guy.

Do you feel it moving?

280
00:10:18,454 --> 00:10:20,195
I can feel it growing.

And just like the kid's diaper,

287
00:10:32,947 --> 00:10:35,732
it's full of
stinky green stuff.

who wants a beer?

Oh, wow.
Yeah.

00:10:41,651 --> 00:10:43,435

Walden, you are gonna
make a great dad.

00:10:46,395 --> 00:10:47,439
Hey.
And, Alan,

294
00:10:47,526 --> 00:10:48,832
you've already raised Jake,

295
00:10:48,919 --> 00:10:51,487
so I guess just...
do the opposite.

296
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:55,752
I still can't believe
it's even possible

297
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:57,884
for two men to have a baby.

298
00:10:57,972 --> 00:10:59,495
What an age we live in.

299
00:10:59,582 --> 00:11:01,149
Science, right?

300
00:11:03,542 --> 00:11:07,372
Larry, we're-we're not
actually having a baby.

301
00:11:07,459 --> 00:11:08,634
We're adopting.

00:11:08,721 --> 00:11:10,897
Ah, shooting blanks, huh?

303
00:11:12,899 --> 00:11:14,249
Well, I guess
if Alan gets pregnant,

304
00:11:14,336 --> 00:11:15,685
you'll know he's been
cheating on you.

305
00:11:18,253 --> 00:11:19,819
So you two are
really married, huh?

306
00:11:19,906 --> 00:11:21,473
Yep.
Yeah, crazy, isn't it?

307
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:23,301
No, I'll tell you what's crazy.

308
00:11:23,388 --> 00:11:25,608
You have never
hit on me once, Walden.

00:11:25,695 --> 00:11:27,871
I mean, we worked together
every day, side by side,

310
00:11:27,958 --> 00:11:29,873
and not so much as
a lingering glance

311
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:32,136

nice today, Barry.

No, man.

315
00:11:38,229 --> 00:11:40,840
We got married
so I could adopt a baby.

That... we're a pretend couple.

317

Why? Well, basic math.

If you have a boy, you only
have to worry about one penis.

You have a girl, you have
to worry about them all.

all this knowledge down

and-and shape their mind.

how to talk to girls

your friends when they need you.

to always be in the bathroom
whenever the dinner check comes.

revolve around my dad.

The time he threw my Tamagotchi
down the garbage disposal.

353
00:13:21,202 --> 00:13:23,769
Time he made a pass
at my prom date.

354

and married my prom date.

534
00:20:05,083 --> 00:20:06,998
Can you show me
the picture of him?

535
00:20:07,085 --> 00:20:08,783
Oh, please, don't put yourself
through this.

536
00:20:08,870 --> 00:20:10,741
Come on, just
one more time.

537
00:20:10,828 --> 00:20:12,134
Okay.

538
00:20:12,221 --> 00:20:14,136
Here.

539
00:20:16,573 --> 00:20:19,141
Look at him.

540
00:20:19,228 --> 00:20:20,621
He's perfect.

541
00:20:23,624 --> 00:20:26,888
I'm sorry this didn't work out
as planned.

542
00:20:26,975 --> 00:20:29,804
He still owes me a high-five.

543
00:20:30,979 --> 00:20:32,502
Don't worry.

544
00:20:32,589 --> 00:20:34,243
We'll find our kid.

545
00:20:36,375 --> 00:20:38,682
I know.

546
00:20:38,769 --> 00:20:42,468
In the meantime,
you're still married to me.

547
00:20:42,556 --> 00:20:44,514
[sobbing]

548
00:20:44,601 --> 00:20:46,516
Yes, I am.

549
00:20:48,649 --> 00:20:51,739
Why couldn't Kathy take you
and give me the baby?

550
00:20:51,826 --> 00:20:55,656
