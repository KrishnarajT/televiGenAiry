But the important thing is
you didn't.

3
00:00:05,943 --> 00:00:08,577
Other than you guys
and my mom, I got nobody.

4
00:00:08,579 --> 00:00:09,911
At least you got jake.

5
00:00:09,913 --> 00:00:11,913
I want to have a kid of my own.

6
00:00:11,915 --> 00:00:13,782
There's no way you're getting
a baby— you're a single guy,

7
00:00:13,784 --> 00:00:16,251
And the system is really geared
towards married couples.

8
00:00:16,253 --> 00:00:18,453
Alan harper,
will you marry me?

9
00:00:18,455 --> 00:00:19,955
I now pronounce you married.

10
00:00:21,023 --> 00:00:23,892
You may kiss.

Uh, yeah, and, uh,

What's the cash advance limit

Holy new rolex.

maiden name?

00:00:51,822 --> 00:00:55,290
Uh, I didn't really know her
before she was married, so...

00:00:55,292 --> 00:00:56,324
Morning.

still be starving in an hour.

Um...

00:01:06,370 --> 00:01:08,370
Hey, I was meaning
to ask you something.

26
00:01:08,372 --> 00:01:10,872
Um, what's your
mother's maiden name?

27
00:01:10,874 --> 00:01:15,410
This might be easier if I just
give you my online password.
Oh.

28
00:01:15,412 --> 00:01:18,680
It's "don't order
credit cards in my name."

29
00:01:20,383 --> 00:01:23,051
Right, uh, all one word,
no spaces?

30
00:01:23,053 --> 00:01:25,120
Hey, there's
the newlyweds.

31
00:01:25,122 --> 00:01:26,888
I made you some
honeymoon pancakes.

00:01:26,890 --> 00:01:28,323
Aw...

33
00:01:28,325 --> 00:01:30,225
They're in the shapes
of hearts and arrows.

34
00:01:30,227 --> 00:01:32,761
Oh, actually,
they're asses and...

35
00:01:32,763 --> 00:01:34,729
Uh, sure—
hearts and arrows.

36
00:01:34,731 --> 00:01:36,164
(laughs)

37
00:01:36,166 --> 00:01:39,100
Alan, my arrow's twice
as big as yours.

38
00:01:39,102 --> 00:01:40,402
Mine's life-size.

39
00:01:40,404 --> 00:01:41,670
I'm still gonna be hungry.

40
00:01:41,672 --> 00:01:44,239
I just realized,
walden,

41
00:01:44,241 --> 00:01:46,308
That I worked for you
when you were single.

42
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:48,843
And now you're married.

43
00:01:48,845 --> 00:01:52,414
Maybe someday I'll be working
for you when you're a widower.

44
00:01:52,416 --> 00:01:54,149
Bacon, zippy?

45
00:01:56,018 --> 00:01:58,320
So, how's the adoption
process going?

46
00:01:58,322 --> 00:02:00,555
Is somebody other than alan
calling you "daddy"?

47
00:02:04,827 --> 00:02:07,362
It's going great.

48
00:02:07,364 --> 00:02:09,364
We have a meeting with
the social services department

49
00:02:09,366 --> 00:02:10,365
This week.

50
00:02:10,367 --> 00:02:11,733
Nice.

51
00:02:11,735 --> 00:02:14,469
So, if you do get a kid,
which room is he gonna live in?

52
00:02:18,174 --> 00:02:20,208
Oh, guys, I'm kind of
a drunken slut,

53
00:02:20,210 --> 00:02:22,544
I don't think I should
share a room with a baby.

Oh, paperwork for our meeting

Um, household
net worth.

60
00:02:42,633 --> 00:02:45,800
Well, let's see, uh, you're
worth a billion dollars,

61
00:02:45,802 --> 00:02:47,502
So together we are worth...

62
00:02:47,504 --> 00:02:49,871
A little bit less than
a billion dollars.

63
00:02:51,374 --> 00:02:54,275
Hey, so evelyn said it's cool
if I crash at her place.

64
00:02:54,277 --> 00:02:55,710
What, wait—
it was that easy?

65
00:02:55,712 --> 00:02:57,145
My mom never
lets me stay there.

66
00:02:57,147 --> 00:02:58,880
Yeah, she's gonna let me live
in the guest house.

67
00:02:58,882 --> 00:03:00,882
There's a guest house?

68
00:03:00,884 --> 00:03:02,917
If-if you need, uh, help
moving, let us know.

69
00:03:02,919 --> 00:03:04,953
Thanks, but evelyn said
I could borrow the range rover.

70
00:03:04,955 --> 00:03:07,555
There's a range rover?

71
00:03:07,557 --> 00:03:09,357
Oh, hey, uh, what should
I put down for, uh...

72
00:03:09,359 --> 00:03:11,059
"why do you want
to adopt a child?"

73
00:03:11,061 --> 00:03:12,193
Hmm.

74
00:03:12,195 --> 00:03:13,194
'cause we're dudes,

75
00:03:13,196 --> 00:03:14,229
And we don't have
baby holes?

76
00:03:14,231 --> 00:03:16,297
(laughing)

77
00:03:19,101 --> 00:03:20,669
You know you have
to sell yourself

78
00:03:20,671 --> 00:03:21,803
As a real couple, right?

79
00:03:21,805 --> 00:03:23,338
We are a real couple.

80
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:25,206
That's why we got married
in the first place.

81
00:03:25,208 --> 00:03:27,542
Yeah, it also gave us the chance
to register at crate & barrel

82
00:03:27,544 --> 00:03:28,943
For this fabulous stemware.

83
00:03:28,945 --> 00:03:30,311
(chimes)
ding.

84
00:03:30,313 --> 00:03:31,680
See, you're making jokes instead

85
00:03:31,682 --> 00:03:34,115
Of expressing real emotion.

86
00:03:34,117 --> 00:03:37,018
You're gonna have to prove that
you're a real couple, you know?

87
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:39,287
That you're in love,
that you're soul mates,

88
00:03:39,289 --> 00:03:41,956
That you can't survive
without the other.

89
00:03:41,958 --> 00:03:44,225
I actually can't survive
without him.

90
00:03:44,227 --> 00:03:45,226
I am just saying,

91
00:03:45,228 --> 00:03:46,361
I don't want to see you

92
00:03:46,363 --> 00:03:47,462
Put all this work in and not get

93
00:03:47,464 --> 00:03:49,264
The payoff you deserve.

94
00:03:49,266 --> 00:03:50,965
It's like when you get
"the tap."

95
00:03:50,967 --> 00:03:52,801
Get the what?
The tap.

96
00:03:52,803 --> 00:03:54,936
You know, when you're
in bed with a girl,

97
00:03:54,938 --> 00:03:56,638
And you've been
down there for a while,

98
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:59,340
And suddenly she gives you
the old "thanks for trying" tap

99
00:03:59,342 --> 00:04:00,909
On the top of the head.

100
00:04:02,311 --> 00:04:03,578
Ah...

101
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:06,748
Oh, yeah, the tap, yeah.

102
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:08,516
I hate the tap.
Mm.

103
00:04:08,518 --> 00:04:11,019
You know, I am sure
that we can be believable

104
00:04:11,021 --> 00:04:12,353
As a loving couple.

105
00:04:13,355 --> 00:04:14,889
You want to see believable?
This... (stammers)

106
00:04:14,891 --> 00:04:16,591
Watch.

107
00:04:16,593 --> 00:04:18,093
Alan,

108
00:04:18,095 --> 00:04:19,761
I love you.

109
00:04:19,763 --> 00:04:21,930
And I love you, walden.

111
00:04:24,234 --> 00:04:25,834
I'm sorry.

112
00:04:25,836 --> 00:04:28,536
You have this one nose hair
that keeps going in and out.
Oh.

113
00:04:28,538 --> 00:04:31,439
And I laughed because
no one could possibly love me.

114
00:04:35,244 --> 00:04:37,312

115
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:39,581

Once again,

117
00:04:40,917 --> 00:04:43,752
You don't have to tell me
every time you masturbate.

118
00:04:43,754 --> 00:04:47,122
I will not apologize
for sharing my day with you.

119
00:04:48,758 --> 00:04:50,024
But that is not this.

120
00:04:50,026 --> 00:04:51,760
It is my essay describing

121
00:04:51,762 --> 00:04:53,261
What I love about my spouse

122
00:04:53,263 --> 00:04:54,863
For our meeting
with the social worker.

123
00:04:54,865 --> 00:04:56,998
Ah, good, I'm so nervous
about this meeting.

124
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,568
I'm somehow constipated and
wracked with explosive diarrhea.

125
00:05:01,771 --> 00:05:04,506
You're not the only one
who can share his day.

126
00:05:04,508 --> 00:05:06,107
Well, after she reads this,

127
00:05:06,109 --> 00:05:08,843
There's no way she won't
believe we're a couple.

128
00:05:08,845 --> 00:05:13,681
Okay, uh, "walden is the most
caring person I know.

129
00:05:13,683 --> 00:05:15,850
He always puts my needs
before his own."

130
00:05:15,852 --> 00:05:17,252
Uh, "whether it's surprising me

00:06:10,439 --> 00:06:12,974
Are you kidding me?

149
00:06:12,976 --> 00:06:14,442
That's what you love about me?

150
00:06:14,444 --> 00:06:16,077
That I've never
been convicted of a felony?

151
00:06:16,079 --> 00:06:17,946
I told you it's
a work in progress.

152
00:06:17,948 --> 00:06:19,380
What do you want me to say?

153
00:06:19,382 --> 00:06:22,116
He masturbates
with impressive frequency?

154
00:06:22,118 --> 00:06:24,686
At least that would show
you're paying attention.

155
00:06:24,688 --> 00:06:26,421
(doorbell rings)
and, by the way—

156
00:06:26,423 --> 00:06:29,624
My favorite meal
is red snapper.

157
00:06:34,230 --> 00:06:35,430
Hi, alan.

158
00:06:35,432 --> 00:06:36,631
Walden.

159
00:06:36,633 --> 00:06:39,500
Lyndsey, what's, uh,
what's going on?

160
00:06:39,502 --> 00:06:40,768
I-I thought you were
in rehab.

161
00:06:40,770 --> 00:06:43,037
I was, I-I got out
a couple days ago.

162
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:44,706
Oh, well, that's great.
C-come on it.

163
00:06:46,542 --> 00:06:50,678
How'd it go?
It was the hardest thing
I've ever done in my life.

164
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:52,013
But-but on the plus side,

165
00:06:52,015 --> 00:06:53,948
It was right up the
street here in malibu,

166
00:06:53,950 --> 00:06:56,351
So ocean views,
spa, chef,

167
00:06:56,353 --> 00:06:57,819
It was like
a five-star hotel.

168
00:06:57,821 --> 00:07:01,522
Except they take
your shoelaces.

169
00:07:01,524 --> 00:07:04,692
Well, I'm sure you two have
a lot to talk about.

170
00:07:04,694 --> 00:07:06,694
So, I'm just gonna go
in the kitchen

171
00:07:06,696 --> 00:07:08,096
And pretend I'm not listening.

172
00:07:10,232 --> 00:07:14,168
Um, so, lyndsey,
I-I'm so proud of you.

173
00:07:14,170 --> 00:07:15,737
Uh, how are you doing?

174
00:07:15,739 --> 00:07:17,071
I'm good.

175
00:07:17,073 --> 00:07:19,040
Um, I-I just got
my 60-day chip.
Oh.

176
00:07:19,042 --> 00:07:22,310
And part of my recovery
is to make amends

177
00:07:22,312 --> 00:07:23,544
To the people I've hurt.

178
00:07:23,546 --> 00:07:25,013
So,

179
00:07:25,015 --> 00:07:28,049
I apologize for everything I did
to you while I was drinking.

180
00:07:28,051 --> 00:07:30,385
Oh, well, I appreciate that, um,

181
00:07:30,387 --> 00:07:32,287
But some of the things
you did to me,

182
00:07:32,289 --> 00:07:33,588
You don't have to apologize for.

183
00:07:34,957 --> 00:07:36,991
I mean, we had sex
in a chipotle.

184
00:07:38,928 --> 00:07:42,664
I ate my burrito,
you ate my burrito.

185
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:46,634
I ate your taco.

186
00:07:46,636 --> 00:07:49,404
And I later threw up
in your car.

187
00:07:49,406 --> 00:07:53,107
Yes, uh, but chunks weren't the
only thing you blew that day.

188
00:07:56,578 --> 00:08:00,481
Um, there is one other thing.

189
00:08:00,483 --> 00:08:03,918
If-if I haven't burned
too many bridges,

190
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:07,488
I was wondering if maybe you
and I could give it another try.

191
00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:08,656
Oh, wow.

192
00:08:08,658 --> 00:08:09,657
Wow, that-that
is flattering.

193
00:08:09,659 --> 00:08:10,658
Um, it's just...

194
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:12,327
(sighs)
you're seeing somebody else.

195
00:08:12,329 --> 00:08:16,331
Uh, kind of, um...

196
00:08:16,333 --> 00:08:17,832
Uh, uh, I'm...

197
00:08:17,834 --> 00:08:19,701
You're married?

198
00:08:20,736 --> 00:08:21,970
That doesn't make any sense.

199
00:08:21,972 --> 00:08:23,037
Who is she?

200
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:26,107
Uh...

201
00:08:26,109 --> 00:08:29,177
Uh, she is-is
actually, uh, a "he."

202
00:08:29,179 --> 00:08:30,578
Um...

203
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:32,280
It's... It's walden.

204
00:08:32,282 --> 00:08:34,782
Oh, my god.

205
00:08:35,784 --> 00:08:38,086
Walden's gay?

206
00:08:40,622 --> 00:08:42,657
♪ men. ♪

207
00:08:42,659 --> 00:08:44,792
So, I guess what
I'm interested in is

208
00:08:44,794 --> 00:08:46,294
How you two got together.

209
00:08:46,296 --> 00:08:48,596
Uh, well, w-we met
at the dog park.

210
00:08:48,598 --> 00:08:51,399
His labradoodle
sniffed my shih tzu.

211
00:08:52,568 --> 00:08:54,869
I remember when I proposed.

212
00:08:54,871 --> 00:08:56,804
I-I got down on one knee,

213
00:08:56,806 --> 00:08:58,773
And I looked up
into his beautiful...

214
00:08:59,975 --> 00:09:02,477
Blue eyes,

215
00:09:02,479 --> 00:09:04,679
And I asked him to share
his life with me.

216
00:09:04,681 --> 00:09:06,914
I guess what
I'm getting at is the fact

217
00:09:06,916 --> 00:09:09,183
That you've both been
married to women before.

218
00:09:09,185 --> 00:09:10,985
So, when did you realize
you were gay?

219
00:09:10,987 --> 00:09:15,590
Oh, well, on some level,
I've always known. Um...

220
00:09:16,692 --> 00:09:19,260
I mean, throughout, uh,
both of my marriages,

221
00:09:19,262 --> 00:09:21,095
I was in complete denial.

222
00:09:21,097 --> 00:09:22,363
Um, but after I met walden,

223
00:09:22,365 --> 00:09:25,066
I finally felt safe
to-to be myself.

224
00:09:25,068 --> 00:09:26,768
Uh, I remember
our first date.

225
00:09:26,770 --> 00:09:28,736
Uh, we went to the bowl to
see the grease sing-along.

226
00:09:28,738 --> 00:09:30,471
Ah, "tell me more,
tell me more."

227
00:09:30,473 --> 00:09:32,874
Well, uh, walden was
dressed as danny zuko,

228
00:09:32,876 --> 00:09:34,008
Uh, and I was sandy—

229
00:09:34,010 --> 00:09:35,643
Uh, hot sandy, you
know, in the leather.

230
00:09:35,645 --> 00:09:37,311
No, no, no, I was doing
the song, you know—

231
00:09:37,313 --> 00:09:38,646
♪ tell me more,
tell me more... ♪

232
00:09:38,648 --> 00:09:41,082
Oh, my god!

233
00:09:41,084 --> 00:09:42,550
Did I miss a show tune cue?

234
00:09:42,552 --> 00:09:43,618
(laughs)

235
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:46,020
Somebody take away my gay card.

236
00:09:47,856 --> 00:09:49,791
And how about you, walden?

237
00:09:49,793 --> 00:09:51,225
When did you know you were gay?

238
00:09:51,227 --> 00:09:54,695
I guess my first clue was
when I saw basic instinct.

239
00:09:55,764 --> 00:09:58,099
All my friends were looking up
sharon stone's skirt,

240
00:09:58,101 --> 00:10:00,134
And I was just looking
at her shoes.

241
00:10:01,603 --> 00:10:04,806
And I guess I got married
because of social pressures,

242
00:10:04,808 --> 00:10:08,076
But, eventually,
I had to be true to who I am.

243
00:10:08,078 --> 00:10:09,510
And I've never
looked back since.

244
00:10:09,512 --> 00:10:11,546
Unless I'm behind him.

245
00:10:11,548 --> 00:10:14,382
(both laughing nervously)

246
00:10:16,251 --> 00:10:18,419
(laughing nervously):
That's a good one.

247
00:10:18,421 --> 00:10:19,720
Ah...

248
00:10:19,722 --> 00:10:23,057
You two are
an interesting couple.

249
00:10:23,059 --> 00:10:24,892
Yeah, I see hundreds
of potential parents,

250
00:10:24,894 --> 00:10:26,160
But you two are
different somehow.

251
00:10:26,162 --> 00:10:27,428
I'm not sure what it is.

252
00:10:27,430 --> 00:10:28,996
Well, uh, maybe it's the fact

253
00:10:28,998 --> 00:10:31,999
That I-I look like I'm wearing
makeup, but I'm not.

254
00:10:33,535 --> 00:10:36,938
Y-you know, we may not be
like other couples, but...

255
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:38,739
I know we can be
good parents.

256
00:10:38,741 --> 00:10:40,508
I get that, but it is my job

257
00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:42,810
To be a hundred percent sure
before I place a child.

258
00:10:42,812 --> 00:10:44,278
No, n-no,
look, look...

259
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:47,748
I-I know we can provide
unconditional love to a child,

260
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:52,253
A-and w-we can create a safe,
secure environment, and...

261
00:10:53,388 --> 00:10:55,490
What do people
that get kids say?

262
00:10:56,458 --> 00:10:57,492
How about this—

263
00:10:57,494 --> 00:10:58,993
How about I come out
to your house?

264
00:10:58,995 --> 00:11:00,428
We normally do
a site visit anyway.

265
00:11:00,430 --> 00:11:02,396
This way I could get to know
you guys a little better.

266
00:11:02,398 --> 00:11:04,265
Yeah, great, yeah,
why don't you come on over,

267
00:11:04,267 --> 00:11:07,602
And you'll see that we're
j-just a normal loving couple.

268
00:11:07,604 --> 00:11:08,603
Right, sweetie?

269
00:11:08,605 --> 00:11:10,738
That-that's right,
wally bear.

270
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:12,173

Oh, flowers.
Nice touch.

275
00:11:25,922 --> 00:11:27,522
Gives the house a homey feel.

276
00:11:27,524 --> 00:11:29,190
They're for you.

277
00:11:29,192 --> 00:11:30,892
Really?

278
00:11:30,894 --> 00:11:33,261
I'm, uh, actually a lily man.

279
00:11:33,263 --> 00:11:35,029
Uh, but they're very nice.

280
00:11:35,031 --> 00:11:36,230
Alan, listen.

281
00:11:36,232 --> 00:11:37,431
Jenny was right.

282
00:11:37,433 --> 00:11:39,667
We are not believable
as a loving couple,

283
00:11:39,669 --> 00:11:42,203
And I think that's why miss
mcmartin wasn't sure about us.

284
00:11:42,205 --> 00:11:43,938
Now, this has
to be real.

285
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:45,273
And that includes—

286
00:11:45,275 --> 00:11:47,708
Being comfortable with
physical affection.

287
00:11:47,710 --> 00:11:49,777
Like this.

288
00:11:52,548 --> 00:11:53,781
Come on.

289
00:11:53,783 --> 00:11:55,016
Loosen up.

290
00:11:55,018 --> 00:11:58,519
I-I'm loose, it just feels
a little forced, that's all.

291
00:11:58,521 --> 00:12:00,855
Okay, well, let
it be natural.

292
00:12:00,857 --> 00:12:02,890
Just snuggle into
these broad shoulders.

293
00:12:08,997 --> 00:12:10,998
I do feel safe.

294
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,267
Damn right, you do.

295
00:12:13,269 --> 00:12:15,336
You're with
your wally bear.

296
00:12:17,272 --> 00:12:19,840
Now, look
into my eyes.

297
00:12:19,842 --> 00:12:21,142
Like this?

298
00:12:21,144 --> 00:12:22,143
Yeah, exactly.

299
00:12:22,145 --> 00:12:23,911
And don't look away.

300
00:12:27,316 --> 00:12:29,116
We love each other.

301
00:12:29,118 --> 00:12:30,351
You're at home.

302
00:12:31,653 --> 00:12:35,289
Oh, I just noticed a little
green fleck in your right eye.

303
00:12:35,291 --> 00:12:37,124
It's like a-a downy
patch of moss

304
00:12:37,126 --> 00:12:39,527
On the trunk
of a majestic oak.

305
00:12:39,529 --> 00:12:41,996
(whispering):
Thank you.

306
00:12:43,932 --> 00:12:46,734
Sometimes I worry that I'm not
good-looking enough for you.

307
00:12:46,736 --> 00:12:48,970
Come on.

308
00:12:48,972 --> 00:12:50,438
You're perfect just
the way you are.

309
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:53,107
My alley cat.

310
00:12:54,576 --> 00:12:56,110
A nickname.

311
00:12:57,479 --> 00:12:59,847
Sometimes...

312
00:12:59,849 --> 00:13:03,217
I worry that you don't know
how much you mean to me.

313
00:13:03,219 --> 00:13:06,320
I want to be
your everything.

314
00:13:20,302 --> 00:13:23,304
All right, yeah!

315
00:13:23,306 --> 00:13:25,439
That was convincing.

316
00:13:25,441 --> 00:13:27,074
We do that in front
of miss mcmartin,

317
00:13:27,076 --> 00:13:29,076
We'll get ten babies.

318
00:13:29,078 --> 00:13:30,311
Yeah, yeah.

319
00:13:30,313 --> 00:13:33,681
That was good enough
to fool just about anyone.

320
00:13:33,683 --> 00:13:35,316
(chuckles nervously)

321
00:13:35,318 --> 00:13:37,318

Uh, correction,
I love to cook,

oh, I'll get that.

If you really want
to see us relaxed

332
00:13:56,205 --> 00:13:58,072
You should come by
for brunch someday.

333
00:13:58,074 --> 00:14:00,741
The mary's are bloody

334

you fell in love with him.

00:14:03,413 --> 00:14:05,780
Really?

336
00:14:05,782 --> 00:14:08,416

Um, have you
been drinking?

340
00:14:15,291 --> 00:14:18,859
Uh, ding-ding-ding,
we have a wiener...

341
00:14:18,861 --> 00:14:20,294
Whoa, whoa,
okay, okay, shh!

Are just getting married
to get a kid.

345
00:14:25,868 --> 00:14:29,270
So, there's no reason you can't
have sex with me on the side.

346
00:14:29,272 --> 00:14:31,038
You know, the "dl."

347
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:33,941
That means "do lyndsey."

348
00:14:33,943 --> 00:14:36,844
Okay, okay, okay, this
is not a good time.

349
00:14:36,846 --> 00:14:38,245
Uh, the-the social
worker's here.

00:14:41,184 --> 00:14:43,484
I can tell her that
you'll be good parents.

353
00:14:43,486 --> 00:14:45,453
And I know because
I'm a g... Oh.

354
00:14:47,055 --> 00:14:49,156
Mother.

355
00:14:49,158 --> 00:14:51,292
Okay, um...

356
00:14:51,294 --> 00:14:53,894
Maybe-maybe we should go
to my room a-and talk.

357
00:14:53,896 --> 00:14:57,865
I won't be able to talk much,
'cause my mouth will be full.

358
00:14:57,867 --> 00:14:58,966
Wink, wink.

359
00:14:58,968 --> 00:15:01,635
(giggles)
hopefully with breath mints.

360
00:15:02,704 --> 00:15:06,006
You wait in here and I will
call a cab to take you home.

361
00:15:06,008 --> 00:15:09,910
My home is in your pants.

362
00:15:09,912 --> 00:15:12,346
What happened? Why did
you start drinking again?

363
00:15:12,348 --> 00:15:14,248
Well, 'cause you married walden.

364
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:16,884
The only person in your life
who's prettier than me.

365
00:15:16,886 --> 00:15:19,086
But you know we're just
doing that to get a kid.

366
00:15:19,088 --> 00:15:21,722
Yeah, but if I wasn't
so screwed up last year,

367
00:15:21,724 --> 00:15:23,324
Then we would still be together.

368
00:15:23,326 --> 00:15:25,593
Then we could get married
and have a baby. (gasps)

369
00:15:25,595 --> 00:15:27,461
We could sell that baby
to walden.

370
00:15:27,463 --> 00:15:29,397
'cause let's face it,

371
00:15:29,399 --> 00:15:31,332
We don't want to raise
another kid,

372
00:15:31,334 --> 00:15:33,200
'cause both our kids suck.

373
00:15:33,202 --> 00:15:35,803
Okay, uh, refreshing,
drunk honesty aside,

374
00:15:35,805 --> 00:15:37,071
Um, d-don't blame yourself.

375
00:15:37,073 --> 00:15:38,539
We all made mistakes.

376
00:15:38,541 --> 00:15:40,975
But we shouldn't let those
mistakes ruin things for walden.

377
00:15:40,977 --> 00:15:42,877
Shh. You talk too much.

378
00:15:42,879 --> 00:15:44,578
Let's party.

379
00:15:47,749 --> 00:15:49,984
Lyndsey? Lyndsey?

380
00:15:49,986 --> 00:15:52,219
(groans)

381
00:15:52,221 --> 00:15:55,222
Wow, a half-naked drunk girl
is in my bed and I'm leaving.

382
00:15:55,224 --> 00:15:56,791
Maybe I am gay.

383
00:15:58,193 --> 00:16:00,728
I like to imagine the
family gathered here,

384
00:16:00,730 --> 00:16:03,230
Eating an all-organic,
gluten-free meal

385
00:16:03,232 --> 00:16:05,800
Of quinoa salad
and kale chips

386
00:16:05,802 --> 00:16:08,235
While watching the
original reality tv:

387
00:16:08,237 --> 00:16:10,638
A beautiful
ocean sunset.

388
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:13,307
As long as this is a stable
environment for a child,

389
00:16:13,309 --> 00:16:15,142
I don't care
if you're eating hot pockets

390
00:16:15,144 --> 00:16:17,178
And watching honey boo boo.

391
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:20,314
Uh, uh, wally bear, uh, can
I borrow you for a minute?

392
00:16:20,316 --> 00:16:22,850
Is it an emergency,
alley cat?

393
00:16:22,852 --> 00:16:26,754
Uh, it's more of a-a pickle, uh,
that needs immediate attention.

394
00:16:28,723 --> 00:16:30,257
Oh, it's okay. Go.

395
00:16:30,259 --> 00:16:32,793
Yeah, I would never come between
a man and his husband's pickle.

396
00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:37,698
Lyndsey's here.
She's drunk.

397
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:38,833
Why?

398
00:16:38,835 --> 00:16:40,167
She wants to have sex with me.

399
00:16:40,169 --> 00:16:42,102
Why?

400
00:16:42,104 --> 00:16:43,270
Wait... Where is she?

401
00:16:43,272 --> 00:16:44,839
She's passed out in my room.

402
00:16:44,841 --> 00:16:46,707
Okay, okay, we-we need
to get ms. Mcmartin

403
00:16:46,709 --> 00:16:48,342
Out of here as fast as we can.

404
00:16:48,344 --> 00:16:50,211
Right, right. Oh, um,
by the way, when lyndsey

405
00:16:50,213 --> 00:16:51,745
Tried to kiss me,
I was totally into it.

406
00:16:51,747 --> 00:16:52,913
I don't know why I was worried.

407
00:16:52,915 --> 00:16:54,682
Worried about what?

408
00:16:54,684 --> 00:16:56,383
Nothing. Let's get her
out of here.

409
00:16:57,853 --> 00:16:59,286
Mm. Everything okay?

410
00:16:59,288 --> 00:17:02,089
Yes, we just had
to reset the...
The, um...

411
00:17:02,091 --> 00:17:03,357
(mumbles): ... Flaven
on the stave.

412
00:17:03,359 --> 00:17:05,192
But, uh, everything's

413
00:17:05,194 --> 00:17:07,628
Okay now. Uh, c-can
I get you anything?

414
00:17:07,630 --> 00:17:09,296
Like directions for
your drive home, or...

415
00:17:09,298 --> 00:17:11,165
You know, I actually
do have to get going.

416
00:17:11,167 --> 00:17:12,833
I did not realize
it was this late.
What?

417
00:17:12,835 --> 00:17:14,635
No.
Oh.

418
00:17:14,637 --> 00:17:16,971
I'm so
disappointed.
Oh.

419
00:17:16,973 --> 00:17:19,006
I'll just get your things
and walk you out.

420
00:17:19,008 --> 00:17:21,275
Oh. There we go.
(chuckles)

421
00:17:21,277 --> 00:17:23,177
I got to say,
you look at that view

422
00:17:23,179 --> 00:17:24,445
And you never want to leave.

423
00:17:24,447 --> 00:17:26,313
And yet you must.

424
00:17:26,315 --> 00:17:28,048
Unless you want to adopt me.

425
00:17:28,050 --> 00:17:30,618
(chuckles) you're so funny.
Here's your jacket.

426
00:17:33,088 --> 00:17:34,288
Walden:
Oh, my god.

427
00:17:34,290 --> 00:17:36,223
What?
Uh...

428
00:17:36,225 --> 00:17:38,025
This jacket,
it's-it's fantastic.

429
00:17:38,027 --> 00:17:40,594
What is this, wool?
I think so, yeah.

430
00:17:40,596 --> 00:17:42,730
Really? Because I... I would've
thought it was linen.

431
00:17:42,732 --> 00:17:44,398
Doesn't it feel
"linen-sy", alan?

432
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,699
No, it's
definitely wool.

433
00:17:47,369 --> 00:17:49,236
Holy crap.
What?

434
00:17:49,238 --> 00:17:51,405
Uh... I forgot to
flip the cushions

435
00:17:51,407 --> 00:17:52,606
On the deck
furniture.

436
00:17:52,608 --> 00:17:53,807
Imagine the
mildew.

437
00:17:53,809 --> 00:17:55,976
Alan.

438
00:17:55,978 --> 00:17:58,112
Milady.

439
00:18:01,216 --> 00:18:03,250
Here we go,
almost got it.

440
00:18:03,252 --> 00:18:04,752
If you could
just stay still...

441
00:18:04,754 --> 00:18:06,020
Yeah... Oh.

442
00:18:08,423 --> 00:18:11,091
Uh, all right, that's it.
That wasn't so hard, was it?

443
00:18:11,093 --> 00:18:13,127
Actually, it was a lot harder
than it needed to be, but...

444
00:18:13,129 --> 00:18:15,429
That's what he said.
(both chuckle)

445
00:18:15,431 --> 00:18:17,498
Uh, well...
Oh, your purse.

446
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:19,199
Well, thank you, guys.

447
00:18:19,201 --> 00:18:20,668
Uh, you'll be hearing
from me soon.

448
00:18:20,670 --> 00:18:22,336
Got it. Bye.

449
00:18:25,073 --> 00:18:26,307
Oh, my god.

450
00:18:26,309 --> 00:18:27,741
Is lyndsey okay?

451
00:18:27,743 --> 00:18:29,510
Oh, sure. She's practically
indestructible when she's drunk.

452
00:18:29,512 --> 00:18:31,378
I've seen her fall down
a flight of stairs

453
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:32,813
And not spill her mojito.

454
00:18:32,815 --> 00:18:34,048
(knocking)

455
00:18:35,150 --> 00:18:38,586
I'm so sorry,
I forgot my phone.

456
00:18:38,588 --> 00:18:41,121
Oh. Here it is, right
here on the table. Hey.
Oh, hey. Ho!

457
00:18:41,123 --> 00:18:42,690
(laughs) got it. And
get the hell out of here.

458
00:18:42,692 --> 00:18:46,026
Oh, one last thing. Um, I'm not
supposed to say anything,

459
00:18:46,028 --> 00:18:47,995
But unless something
crazy happens,

460
00:18:47,997 --> 00:18:49,396
You're gonna get approved.

461
00:18:50,198 --> 00:18:51,198
Seriously?

462
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,499
Get out of here.

463
00:18:52,501 --> 00:18:53,701
Seriously.

464
00:18:53,703 --> 00:18:56,637
I'm here to help
with the baby.

465
00:18:56,639 --> 00:18:57,738
Seriously?

466
00:18:57,740 --> 00:18:58,939
Who is this?

467
00:18:58,941 --> 00:19:00,341
Uh, uh, she is...

468
00:19:00,343 --> 00:19:03,210
Oh, you know what,
this happens all the time.

469
00:19:03,212 --> 00:19:05,079
Tourists get an out-of-date
map to celebrity homes.

470
00:19:05,081 --> 00:19:09,450
Honey, charlie sheen
doesn't live here anymore.

471
00:19:09,452 --> 00:19:11,852
Jenny:
Lyndsey?

472
00:19:11,854 --> 00:19:13,320
Hi.

473
00:19:13,322 --> 00:19:14,521
And who is this?

474
00:19:14,523 --> 00:19:16,957
I fell down
in the sand.

475
00:19:16,959 --> 00:19:18,459
This is...

476
00:19:18,461 --> 00:19:20,761
I'm the next-door
neighbor. Hi.

477
00:19:20,763 --> 00:19:22,029
Uh, we were having
a get-together

478
00:19:22,031 --> 00:19:23,530
And this one got away.

479
00:19:23,532 --> 00:19:24,965
Our next-door
neighbor.
That... Oh, that's right,

480
00:19:24,967 --> 00:19:26,100
I remember you

481
00:19:26,102 --> 00:19:27,935
From the fourth of
July block party.

482
00:19:27,937 --> 00:19:30,471
Yeah... Oh, which, by the way,
is amazing for kids.

483
00:19:30,473 --> 00:19:31,939
A waterslide,
shaved ice.

484
00:19:31,941 --> 00:19:34,475
My waterslide's
shaved.

485
00:19:34,477 --> 00:19:36,977
Okay, time to go home.

486
00:19:36,979 --> 00:19:38,379
And, um, you know what?

487
00:19:38,381 --> 00:19:40,581
These guys are great.
Ask anyone on our block.

488
00:19:40,583 --> 00:19:42,449
We're all pulling for them
to get a kid.

489
00:19:42,451 --> 00:19:44,118
Thank you.
You're very
sweet.

490
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:45,719
Okay, here we go.

491
00:19:45,721 --> 00:19:46,954
No, where are you
taking me?

492
00:19:46,956 --> 00:19:48,155
To get a drink.

493
00:19:48,157 --> 00:19:49,757
Aw, you're
my best friend.

494
00:19:51,359 --> 00:19:53,661
Boy. Glad I never
gave her a baby.

495
00:19:53,663 --> 00:19:55,963
