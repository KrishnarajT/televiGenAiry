They all ask, Mmm.

177
00:07:23,211 --> 00:07:24,821
"What are you doing with
Alan?" But nobody asks,

178
00:07:24,908 --> 00:07:26,780
"What are you doing with
the guy in the Ferrari?"

179
00:07:26,867 --> 00:07:28,433
BERTA:
Oh, wow.

180
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:30,827
Sweet ride, Walden.

181
00:07:30,914 --> 00:07:33,308
Finally a car
as pretty as you are.

182
00:07:33,395 --> 00:07:34,744
It's actually mine.

183
00:07:34,831 --> 00:07:36,833
There is no God.

184
00:07:38,182 --> 00:07:39,705
Alan, we talked
about this.

185
00:07:39,793 --> 00:07:41,055
I thought you were gonna get
something practical.

186
00:07:41,142 --> 00:07:42,883
I thought so, too.

187
00:07:42,970 --> 00:07:44,493
But Michael Caine is out
of the country shooting a movie,

188
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:46,321
so here we are.

189
00:07:46,408 --> 00:07:47,801
Couldn't you have talked
some sense into him?

190
00:07:47,888 --> 00:07:49,454
I told him to get
whatever he wants.

191
00:07:49,541 --> 00:07:52,153
Don't hate the genie,
hate the wish.

192
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:55,460
Right now I hate the idiot
who wasted it on a Ferrari.

193
00:07:55,547 --> 00:07:58,159
Lyndsey, w-wait, wait.
We can take it for a spin.

194
00:07:58,246 --> 00:07:59,987
I'll let you drive!

195
00:08:00,074 --> 00:08:01,945
Not a chance.

196
00:08:02,032 --> 00:08:03,817
What the hell? I really thought
she was gonna like it.

197
00:08:03,904 --> 00:08:05,644
I know. Me, too.

198
00:08:05,731 --> 00:08:07,777
Hey, Berta, uh, if you had
one wish, what would you get?

199
00:08:07,864 --> 00:08:09,474
Have you signed the
divorce papers yet?

200
00:08:09,561 --> 00:08:11,433

heard from Lyndsey?

No.

I even pulled out the big guns.

206
00:08:22,313 --> 00:08:25,273
I texted her a picture of
my penis with a sad face on it.

207
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:28,276
Why would that work on her

208
00:08:28,363 --> 00:08:31,453

00:08:35,022 --> 00:08:38,329
Alan, why did you send me
your sad penis pic?

212
00:08:38,416 --> 00:08:40,157
I-I'm sorry.
That was for Lyndsey.

213
00:08:40,244 --> 00:08:43,204
Come on, man!

214
00:08:43,291 --> 00:08:44,945
Grow up.
She's seen it in person.

215
00:08:45,032 --> 00:08:46,685
Yeah, and it was sad then, too.

216
00:08:46,772 --> 00:08:48,687
Yeah, well, that sad penis

217
00:08:48,774 --> 00:08:50,689
is driving around
in a brand-new Ferrari.

218
00:08:50,776 --> 00:08:53,997
Why can't you talk
like a person?

219
00:08:54,084 --> 00:08:56,652
Wait, so you used your wish
on a Ferrari?

220
00:08:58,045 --> 00:08:59,829
And how did Lyndsey feel
about that?

221
00:08:59,916 --> 00:09:01,831
Well, she hated it,
and I just don't know why.

222
00:09:01,918 --> 00:09:04,573
I-It was like our anniversary
lunch at Hooters all over again.

Don't you know anything
about women?

Uh, you and I dated... I think
you know the answer to that.

225
00:09:10,448 --> 00:09:13,887
You had the chance to do
something for you andLyndsey,

226
00:09:13,974 --> 00:09:16,324
and instead you did something
just for yourself.

WALDEN:
You know what?

228
00:09:17,455 --> 00:09:18,674
This is my fault.

229
00:09:18,761 --> 00:09:20,719
I gave you
too much power.

You don't give
a monkey a gun.

231
00:09:23,461 --> 00:09:27,683
Did we learn nothing
from Planet of the Apes?

232
00:09:27,770 --> 00:09:30,077
So how do I make this right
for Lyndsey?

233
00:09:30,164 --> 00:09:34,168
Oh. Maybe you could paint
a smiley face on her vagina.

234
00:09:36,039 --> 00:09:38,650
If she had one wish,
what would it be?

235
00:09:38,737 --> 00:09:40,087
To be married to him.

236
00:09:40,174 --> 00:09:41,784
Okay, that's probably true,

237
00:09:41,871 --> 00:09:44,308
but she can't have Walden.

And make sure she knows that.

239
00:09:46,658 --> 00:09:48,747
But I think you might
be on the right track

240
00:09:48,834 --> 00:09:50,575
that she would
like a commitment.

241
00:09:50,662 --> 00:09:51,925
Wow... a commitment.

I should marry Lyndsey,

the right time.
