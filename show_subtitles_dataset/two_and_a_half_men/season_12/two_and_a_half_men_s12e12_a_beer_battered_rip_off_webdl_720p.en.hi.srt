00:00:02,804 --> 00:00:04,605
♪ men. ♪

2
00:00:04,607 --> 00:00:05,806
Okay, here it is.

3
00:00:05,808 --> 00:00:07,575
This is louis' first
science fair project.

4
00:00:07,577 --> 00:00:08,576
You're gonna love it.

5
00:00:08,578 --> 00:00:09,777
Wow.

6
00:00:09,779 --> 00:00:11,579
Louis made this all by himself.

7
00:00:11,581 --> 00:00:13,214
Last time I was here,

8
00:00:13,216 --> 00:00:15,950
He got the straw from his
juice box stuck in his nose.

9
00:00:15,952 --> 00:00:18,352
He also got it unstuck.

10
00:00:19,621 --> 00:00:21,055
Uh, check it out.

11
00:00:21,057 --> 00:00:23,557
So, uh, so we'll take
a piece of bread, all right?

12
00:00:23,559 --> 00:00:25,760
Put it in the mouth,

13
00:00:25,762 --> 00:00:27,762
Where the saliva will
start to dissolve the bread.

14
00:00:27,764 --> 00:00:29,330
And then it'll travel
down to the stomach,

15
00:00:29,332 --> 00:00:33,334
Where the acids will break down
the complex carbohydrates.

16
00:00:33,336 --> 00:00:35,770
At which point it will
move past the appendix,

17
00:00:35,772 --> 00:00:38,172
Which does nothing.

18
00:00:38,174 --> 00:00:40,241
Yeah, we should rename
that the alan.

19
00:00:40,243 --> 00:00:42,977
Uh, and then it'll go
to the small intestines,

20
00:00:42,979 --> 00:00:44,512
The large intestines,
where finally...

21
00:00:44,514 --> 00:00:45,746
(imitates flatulence)

22
00:00:49,084 --> 00:00:50,584
Oh, dear god.

23
00:00:50,586 --> 00:00:52,420
Uh, no, it's okay,
it's a hershey's kiss.

24
00:00:52,422 --> 00:00:56,957
So the reason I came
over is to tell you—

25
00:00:56,959 --> 00:00:58,526
We are ready to start
the final steps

26
00:00:58,528 --> 00:01:00,461
For you to officially
adopt louis.

27
00:01:00,463 --> 00:01:03,931
Oh, my god, I'm gonna
hershey's kiss my pants.

28
00:01:03,933 --> 00:01:06,634
But before the
adoption is final,

29
00:01:06,636 --> 00:01:09,170
I want you to tell louis
you two aren't gay.

30
00:01:09,172 --> 00:01:11,339
Are you sure that this is
the best time to do that?

31
00:01:11,341 --> 00:01:12,773
I mean, I haven't even
talked to him

32
00:01:12,775 --> 00:01:14,175
About the birds
and the bees,

33
00:01:14,177 --> 00:01:15,976
Let alone the bees
and the bees.

34
00:01:15,978 --> 00:01:18,379
I know there is never
a perfect time

35
00:01:18,381 --> 00:01:21,415
To tell your son his two dads
aren't gay...

36
00:01:22,718 --> 00:01:25,353
But it'll be more harmful
the longer you wait.

37
00:01:25,355 --> 00:01:27,355
Yeah, but it's just,
like, h-how do I tell him?

38
00:01:27,357 --> 00:01:29,523
Um, does hallmark make
a "sorry, son,

39
00:01:29,525 --> 00:01:31,492
It turns out
I'm straight" card?

40
00:01:31,494 --> 00:01:33,294
You've been a fantastic father
so far.

41
00:01:33,296 --> 00:01:34,895
I am confident
you will handle this

42
00:01:34,897 --> 00:01:36,330
With the utmost attention
and care.

43
00:01:36,332 --> 00:01:37,331
Alan:
Walden?

44
00:01:37,333 --> 00:01:39,367
Him I'm worried about.

45
00:01:39,369 --> 00:01:40,334
Sorry I'm late.

46
00:01:40,336 --> 00:01:41,535
Uh, I took louis
to the mall

47
00:01:41,537 --> 00:01:42,737
To get him some
new school clothes.

48
00:01:42,739 --> 00:01:44,372
He's trying them on
right now.

49
00:01:44,374 --> 00:01:47,475
Plus there was a new kiosk
that will bedazzle anything.

50
00:01:47,477 --> 00:01:49,777
Got an iphone case for my boo.

51
00:01:51,012 --> 00:01:53,314
Now, I'm gonna bedazzle
your cheek with some sugar.

52
00:01:53,316 --> 00:01:54,715
(chuckles dryly)

53
00:01:54,717 --> 00:01:58,719
Alan, as your social worker,
I cannot accept gifts.

54
00:01:58,721 --> 00:02:00,588
And as your "boo,"
hell no.

55
00:02:01,923 --> 00:02:04,358
I can't believe
I'm just realizing this,

56
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:06,527
But the perfect person
to date a social worker

57
00:02:06,529 --> 00:02:08,329
Is a needy child.

58
00:02:08,331 --> 00:02:10,598
We were just discussing
that it would be

59
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:12,433
In the best interest
of louis to tell him

60
00:02:12,435 --> 00:02:14,068
You two aren't actually gay.

61
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:16,070
Oh, I agree
100 percent.

62
00:02:16,072 --> 00:02:18,506
I mean, it's not like anyone was
buying either one of us

63
00:02:18,508 --> 00:02:20,074
As a gay man anyway.

64
00:02:20,076 --> 00:02:22,676
Ooh, that top is
fierce, girl. Rawr.

65
00:02:24,446 --> 00:02:26,847
Louis, could you come
in here for a second?

66
00:02:26,849 --> 00:02:28,449
Oh, oh, we're doing
it right now?

67
00:02:28,451 --> 00:02:31,952
(sighs) it will be such a relief
to discontinue this charade.

68
00:02:37,225 --> 00:02:39,059
What are you wearing?

69
00:02:39,061 --> 00:02:43,364
Alan says between business
casual and country club chic.

70
00:02:43,366 --> 00:02:44,598
Now turn around.

71
00:02:47,936 --> 00:02:50,538
He's "bedazzle-ous."

72
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:53,274
Okay, should we
tell him now?

73
00:02:53,276 --> 00:02:55,509
I don't think
he's gonna believe us.

78
00:03:10,326 --> 00:03:12,326
I talked to louis.

79
00:03:12,328 --> 00:03:14,562
He said you guys told him
you're not gay.

80
00:03:14,564 --> 00:03:17,798
Yeah, we didn't want
to lie to him anymore.

81
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,867
So now you're just
lying to yourself.

82
00:03:25,574 --> 00:03:28,342
Lyndsey?

83
00:03:28,344 --> 00:03:31,078
Hi, alan. Can we talk?
Sure, come on in.

84
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:33,080
Uh, can I give you
a hand with your box?

85
00:03:33,082 --> 00:03:35,516
Boy, I haven't said that
to you in a while.

86
00:03:35,518 --> 00:03:37,852
I'll say to you now
what I said to you then.

87
00:03:37,854 --> 00:03:39,453
It's easier
if I just do it myself.

88
00:03:39,455 --> 00:03:41,856
I was cleaning out
my house,

89
00:03:41,858 --> 00:03:43,457
And I found some
of your old things.

90
00:03:43,459 --> 00:03:45,459
Oh, look at
this stuff.

91
00:03:45,461 --> 00:03:47,661
Oh, here's a picture from
our caribbean vacation.

92
00:03:47,663 --> 00:03:50,197
Oh, remember how I got
stung by that jellyfish?

93
00:03:50,199 --> 00:03:54,201
Of course I do— you made me pee
on you to neutralize the pain.

94
00:03:54,203 --> 00:03:56,537
Seems like you got stung
a lot on that vacation.

95
00:03:57,506 --> 00:03:58,839
Did I?

96
00:03:58,841 --> 00:03:59,940
Wow!

97
00:03:59,942 --> 00:04:00,941
Oh, look.

98
00:04:00,943 --> 00:04:02,343
Wow, my old boom box.

99
00:04:02,345 --> 00:04:05,513
Oh, and it still has that
mix cd I made for us.

100
00:04:05,515 --> 00:04:08,616

(turns off music)

107
00:04:18,528 --> 00:04:20,728
How did I ever let you
make love to me

108
00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:22,563
While you sang
other women's names?

109
00:04:22,565 --> 00:04:25,533
Be fair, you used to
scream other guys' names.

110
00:04:25,535 --> 00:04:28,402
Anyway, I didn't come by
just to bring you your stuff.

111
00:04:28,404 --> 00:04:32,640
I also wanted to tell you
that I've decided to move away.

112
00:04:32,642 --> 00:04:34,008
Get a fresh start.

113
00:04:34,010 --> 00:04:35,009
What?

114
00:04:35,011 --> 00:04:36,577
Uh, wh-where's
this coming from?

115
00:04:36,579 --> 00:04:38,746
I've been thinking about it
for a while,

116
00:04:38,748 --> 00:04:40,748
And there's nothing for me here.

117
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:42,583
I mean, most of my memories
involve a time

118
00:04:42,585 --> 00:04:44,585
When I was drinking
really heavily,

119
00:04:44,587 --> 00:04:45,553
And those aren't pretty.

120
00:04:45,555 --> 00:04:47,555
I mean, the bar
by my house has a drink

121
00:04:47,557 --> 00:04:48,989
Called "the lyndsey special."

122
00:04:48,991 --> 00:04:50,991
It's a bottle of merlot,
a shot of vodka

123
00:04:50,993 --> 00:04:53,928
And a scrunchie to hold your
hair back while you throw up.

124
00:04:53,930 --> 00:04:56,163
So where do you think
you're gonna go?

125
00:04:56,165 --> 00:04:58,666
Well, I have family
in arizona, so...

126
00:04:58,668 --> 00:05:00,734
Not there.

127
00:05:00,736 --> 00:05:02,937
Ah, you know, I just,
I can't believe it.

128
00:05:02,939 --> 00:05:05,506
I mean, well, I hope you don't
forget about me completely.

129
00:05:05,508 --> 00:05:07,675
You're a hard person
to forget, alan harper.

130
00:05:07,677 --> 00:05:08,676
I've tried.

131
00:05:08,678 --> 00:05:10,444
Hence, "the lyndsey special."

132
00:05:10,446 --> 00:05:11,612
Mm.

133
00:05:11,614 --> 00:05:13,614
Anyway, I just wanted
to let you know.

134
00:05:13,616 --> 00:05:15,683
This is gonna
be so strange.

135
00:05:15,685 --> 00:05:17,051
I mean, even when
we weren't together,

136
00:05:17,053 --> 00:05:18,852
It was nice knowing
you were nearby.

137
00:05:18,854 --> 00:05:20,254
Ah, I know what you mean.

138
00:05:20,256 --> 00:05:22,256
Well, this is it.

139
00:05:22,258 --> 00:05:23,357
Good-bye, alan.

140
00:05:23,359 --> 00:05:24,525
Good-bye, lyndsey.

141
00:05:24,527 --> 00:05:26,727
(both chuckle)

142
00:05:26,729 --> 00:05:29,763
Are we really not gonna talk
about the 20 bucks you owe me?

143
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:33,400
I am really
gonna miss you.

144
00:05:33,402 --> 00:05:34,969
I'll miss you, too.

145
00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:43,110
Let's go
to your room.

146
00:05:43,112 --> 00:05:44,545
Okay, great.

147
00:05:44,547 --> 00:05:46,313
Ow!
What's wrong?

148
00:05:46,315 --> 00:05:48,749
I just got stung by a jellyfish
earlier, that's all.

149
00:05:48,751 --> 00:05:50,751

00:05:55,324 --> 00:05:57,758
Yeah, still got it.

00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:00,761
Sex is very different
when you're sober.

154
00:06:00,763 --> 00:06:02,763
Now I really know
how long two minutes is.

155
00:06:02,765 --> 00:06:04,398
It was a special occasion.

156
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,799
I wanted to give you
a little something extra.

157
00:06:05,801 --> 00:06:07,801
Well, thank you.

158
00:06:07,803 --> 00:06:09,970
This puts a nice cap
on our relationship.

159
00:06:10,939 --> 00:06:12,773
Wait.

160
00:06:12,775 --> 00:06:15,075
I can't have this be
the last time we make love.

161
00:06:15,077 --> 00:06:17,645
The last time I put
on your panties.

162
00:06:17,647 --> 00:06:19,813
The last time you say,
"no, not there,"

163
00:06:19,815 --> 00:06:22,249
And I pretend
I was just confused.

164
00:06:22,251 --> 00:06:23,617
Look, I'm not saying
I won't miss you,

165
00:06:23,619 --> 00:06:25,252
But the fact is
you're married.

166
00:06:25,254 --> 00:06:26,687
You're about to adopt a child.

167
00:06:26,689 --> 00:06:27,855
That's my point.

168
00:06:27,857 --> 00:06:29,857
The adoption is almost final,
and when it is,

169
00:06:29,859 --> 00:06:31,859
Walden and I will get a divorce.

170
00:06:31,861 --> 00:06:35,095
And I misspelled my name
on the prenup.

171
00:06:36,264 --> 00:06:38,799
We'll live like kings.

172
00:06:38,801 --> 00:06:40,801
Are you really
asking me to stay?

173
00:06:40,803 --> 00:06:43,804
Yes, I mean, we've shared
so much over the years.

174
00:06:43,806 --> 00:06:45,372
We can't just

Anywhere near ms. Mcmartin.

353
00:12:35,691 --> 00:12:37,524
But I think
I can help...
No!

354
00:12:37,526 --> 00:12:39,126
You've already done
enough damage.

355
00:12:39,128 --> 00:12:41,028
And I'm warning you,
you stay away.

356
00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:42,195
I am a billionaire

357
00:12:42,197 --> 00:12:45,132
And I can buy my way out
of at least one murder.

358
00:12:45,134 --> 00:12:46,867
This is still america.

359
00:12:46,869 --> 00:12:48,101
♪ men. ♪

360
00:12:49,504 --> 00:12:51,705
So, what looks good?

361
00:12:51,707 --> 00:12:53,840
And don't say my boobs.

362
00:12:53,842 --> 00:12:55,375
Why would I say "my boobs"

363
00:12:55,377 --> 00:12:57,177
When it's your boobs
that I like?

364
00:12:57,179 --> 00:12:58,211
(laughs)

365
00:12:58,213 --> 00:12:59,746
Have you thought about us?

366
00:12:59,748 --> 00:13:01,181
Yes.

367
00:13:01,183 --> 00:13:02,149
I want to give it a try.

368
00:13:02,151 --> 00:13:03,316
Oh, you do?

369
00:13:03,318 --> 00:13:04,651
Oh, that is so great.
I know!

370
00:13:04,653 --> 00:13:07,154
The rest of our life together
starts right now.

371
00:13:07,156 --> 00:13:08,321
Yes!

372
00:13:08,323 --> 00:13:10,157
Or in three weeks, when
I can see you again.

373
00:13:10,159 --> 00:13:11,158
What?

374
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:12,325
Oh, well, walden is worried

375
00:13:12,327 --> 00:13:13,693
About the adoption.

376
00:13:13,695 --> 00:13:15,228
He doesn't want there to be
any complications.

377
00:13:15,230 --> 00:13:17,064
So he thinks I'll screw it up?

378
00:13:17,066 --> 00:13:18,398
No, he thinks
I'll screw it up.

379
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:20,333
Oh, sure.

380
00:13:20,335 --> 00:13:22,169
So I just think
it's better if we lay low

381
00:13:22,171 --> 00:13:23,170
Until after the court date.

382
00:13:23,172 --> 00:13:24,704
I understand.

383
00:13:24,706 --> 00:13:26,673
Is that why we drove
an hour away from the ocean

384
00:13:26,675 --> 00:13:28,208
To go to a seafood restaurant?

385
00:13:28,210 --> 00:13:30,110
Ah, that and...

386
00:13:30,112 --> 00:13:31,778
No corkage fee.

387
00:13:34,082 --> 00:13:35,082
Ooh.

388
00:13:35,084 --> 00:13:37,350
A pinot.

389
00:13:40,188 --> 00:13:42,022
Oh! Oh, you don't mind
if I drink, do you?

390
00:13:42,024 --> 00:13:45,092
I can honestly say
I've never been less tempted.

391
00:13:45,094 --> 00:13:46,893
Good legs...

392
00:13:46,895 --> 00:13:49,096
Mmm, full body...

393
00:13:49,098 --> 00:13:50,864
Goes down easy.

394
00:13:50,866 --> 00:13:53,733
They should call this
"the lyndsey special."

395
00:13:53,735 --> 00:13:56,136
Cute.

396
00:13:56,138 --> 00:13:58,572
You know, I-I certainly
wouldn't want to do anything

397
00:13:58,574 --> 00:13:59,973
To jeopardize the adoption.

398
00:13:59,975 --> 00:14:02,042
And taking it slow
is probably better for us, too.

399
00:14:02,044 --> 00:14:05,879
Oh! Lyndsey plus alan
equals "us."

400
00:14:05,881 --> 00:14:07,147

worker.

410
00:14:27,069 --> 00:14:31,271
Uh, remember, I told you
about her and the adoption?

411
00:14:31,273 --> 00:14:35,175
Um, uh, lyndsey
is my cousin,

412
00:14:35,177 --> 00:14:38,745
Um, from cedar
rapids, iowa.

413
00:14:38,747 --> 00:14:39,746
What?

414
00:14:39,748 --> 00:14:41,848
So you make out
with your cousin?

415
00:14:41,850 --> 00:14:45,085
I said she
was from iowa.

416
00:14:45,087 --> 00:14:46,987
Is this why you
broke up with me?

417
00:14:46,989 --> 00:14:47,988
For her?

418
00:14:47,990 --> 00:14:49,289
Hold on.

419
00:14:49,291 --> 00:14:50,924
You're dating
your social worker?

420
00:14:50,926 --> 00:14:51,925
He was.

421

Did I say I was single?

425
00:14:57,666 --> 00:14:59,432
Yeah.
Right after we had sex.

426
00:14:59,434 --> 00:15:01,201
Did we have sex?

427
00:15:01,203 --> 00:15:02,435
You had sex with her?

I mean,
I grant you that, you know,

Oh. (laughs)

Come on,

539
00:19:30,071 --> 00:19:32,071
Any guy would be lucky
to be with you.

540
00:19:32,073 --> 00:19:33,740
Oh, you're just saying that.

541
00:19:33,742 --> 00:19:35,108
No, you're awesome.

00:19:35,110 --> 00:19:36,609
And what you do for a living,
helping those kids,

543
00:19:36,611 --> 00:19:38,044
Changing their lives,

544
00:19:38,046 --> 00:19:40,113
Putting your hand
on my leg...

545
00:19:43,384 --> 00:19:44,384
Wow.

546
00:19:44,386 --> 00:19:45,752

547
00:19:45,754 --> 00:19:47,754
I can't believe this.

548
00:19:47,756 --> 00:19:49,956
You're not
the only one.

549
00:19:49,958 --> 00:19:51,458
I don't want you to worry.

550
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:52,826
I'm not going to let the fact

551
00:19:52,828 --> 00:19:55,128
That we are in a relationship
affect louis.

552

Learned that lesson, am I right?

553
00:19:57,632 --> 00:19:58,998

00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,301
Yeah.

555
00:20:01,303 --> 00:20:03,503
Relationship.

Okay.

557
00:20:05,273 --> 00:20:08,107
I am going
to go...
Where?

558
00:20:08,109 --> 00:20:09,809
Where are you going?

559
00:20:09,811 --> 00:20:12,445
To the bathroom.

560
00:20:12,447 --> 00:20:14,481
Oh, okay.
