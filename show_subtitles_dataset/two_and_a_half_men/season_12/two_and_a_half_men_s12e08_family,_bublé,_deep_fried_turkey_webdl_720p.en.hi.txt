Hold up your gifts.

4
00:00:07,210 --> 00:00:09,077
Everybody has to see the gold

5

So they know
we're the three wise men.

It's 88 degrees out.

7
00:00:13,216 --> 00:00:14,616
I don't have any myrrh.

Unless it's the biblical term
for "swamp ass."

9
00:00:18,088 --> 00:00:19,454
We want this
to be mantel-worthy.

10
00:00:19,456 --> 00:00:22,190
We want people to say, you know,

00:00:36,473 --> 00:00:38,373
Okay, here we go.

19
00:00:39,543 --> 00:00:41,910

Sorry about that.

00:00:47,384 --> 00:00:48,750
Oh, that's so cute.

24
00:00:48,752 --> 00:00:50,685
You guys are dressed
as duck dynasty.

25
00:00:52,154 --> 00:00:54,556
No. We're the three kings
of bethlehem.

26
00:00:54,558 --> 00:00:56,291
Oh, right.

27
00:00:56,293 --> 00:00:58,126

Guys, look at him.

00:01:00,564 --> 00:01:05,266
Isn't he the cutest
in his little robe and beard?

30
00:01:05,268 --> 00:01:07,302
You want my gold?

31
00:01:07,304 --> 00:01:09,270
Women:
Oh!

00:01:09,272 --> 00:01:12,340
First cute girl he meets, he's

So did charlie.

46
00:01:42,139 --> 00:01:44,873
He used to put snow
on every mirror in the house.

47
00:01:44,875 --> 00:01:46,975
Okay.

48
00:01:46,977 --> 00:01:48,677
Hey, hey, buddy, why
don't you go inside

49
00:01:48,679 --> 00:01:50,211
And write your letter to santa?

50
00:01:50,213 --> 00:01:51,713
Santa's not real.

51
00:01:51,715 --> 00:01:52,847
What?

52
00:01:52,849 --> 00:01:54,783
Of course he is.

53
00:01:54,785 --> 00:01:57,285
He's never brought me
anything I asked for.

54
00:01:57,287 --> 00:01:58,820
Hey, I am sure

55
00:01:58,822 --> 00:02:01,656
That santa's gonna come through
for you this year, buddy.

56
00:02:01,658 --> 00:02:03,892
That's what grown-ups
always say.

57
00:02:05,861 --> 00:02:07,529
Come inside with me.

58
00:02:07,531 --> 00:02:11,166
I made gingerbread zippys.

59
00:02:11,168 --> 00:02:13,368
I was gonna make
gingerbread houses,

60
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:15,937
But everybody knows
zippys don't have houses.

61
00:02:18,841 --> 00:02:21,876
A six-year-old boy
who doesn't believe in santa.

62
00:02:21,878 --> 00:02:23,878
How sad is that?

63
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:26,915
Almost as sad as my
20-year-old boy who does.

64
00:02:26,917 --> 00:02:28,550
This sucks.

65
00:02:28,552 --> 00:02:31,019
Just 'cause he grew up
in a group home doesn't mean

66
00:02:31,021 --> 00:02:33,021
That he can't enjoy
the magic of christmas.

67
00:02:33,023 --> 00:02:35,390
I know. It was always
jake's favorite holiday.

68
00:02:35,392 --> 00:02:36,991
Especially the year he turned 13

69
00:02:36,993 --> 00:02:38,893
And got his first
christmas boner.

70
00:02:40,029 --> 00:02:42,864
It was the only toy
he played with all day.

71
00:02:42,866 --> 00:02:45,233
Hey, you know,
I bet louis would believe

72
00:02:45,235 --> 00:02:47,368
If we got him
exactly what he wanted.

73
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:48,870
I don't know what he wants.

74
00:02:48,872 --> 00:02:50,205
Rose:
He wants a bike.

75
00:02:50,207 --> 00:02:52,240
God! Rose.

76
00:02:52,242 --> 00:02:54,442
What are you
doing here?

77
00:02:54,444 --> 00:02:56,044
Wait. How do you know
about louis?

78
00:02:56,046 --> 00:02:58,913
Oh, walden, you're so adorable.

79
00:02:58,915 --> 00:03:01,516
I just wanted to bring by
my homemade christmas candies.

80
00:03:01,518 --> 00:03:03,151
Do you like nuts?

81
00:03:04,754 --> 00:03:07,388
Covered in chocolate, yes.

82
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:09,390
With a sweater and skirt, no.

83
00:03:09,392 --> 00:03:11,392
Oh. Okay.

84
00:03:11,394 --> 00:03:14,529
On this day, walden's heart
shrank three sizes.

85
00:03:14,531 --> 00:03:15,897
Anyway,

86
00:03:15,899 --> 00:03:18,032
I know this time of year
can get busy,

87
00:03:18,034 --> 00:03:20,135
So if you need a helping hand,
I'm here.

88
00:03:20,137 --> 00:03:23,271
I can wrap presents or babysit
or read a christmas story.

89
00:03:23,273 --> 00:03:25,106
I'm great at doing voices.

90
00:03:25,108 --> 00:03:27,208
Or hearing them.

91
00:03:27,210 --> 00:03:28,977
What do you want, rose?

92
00:03:28,979 --> 00:03:31,579
My dna, my fingerprints,
a lock of my hair?

93
00:03:31,581 --> 00:03:33,047
No, silly.

94
00:03:33,049 --> 00:03:34,916
I have all that.

95
00:03:34,918 --> 00:03:36,584
I want to be your friend again.

96
00:03:36,586 --> 00:03:38,153
I don't think
that I'm comfortable

97
00:03:38,155 --> 00:03:40,088
With you being around louis.

98
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:41,923
Or me.

99
00:03:41,925 --> 00:03:44,225
If you want to hang out
with alan, that's fine.

100
00:03:45,728 --> 00:03:47,796

00:03:58,108 --> 00:03:59,007
It's eggnog.

With no rum!

106
00:04:01,977 --> 00:04:04,679
Eggnog without booze
is as boring and bland

107
00:04:04,681 --> 00:04:06,748
As church without booze.

108
00:04:09,084 --> 00:04:12,787
Be a dear and go get some
rum for your grandmother.

109
00:04:12,789 --> 00:04:16,024
Evelyn, he's six years old.

110
00:04:16,026 --> 00:04:18,593
Oh. Yes, right.

111
00:04:18,595 --> 00:04:22,497
The rum is in a bottle
with a pirate on it.

112
00:04:22,499 --> 00:04:26,167
Maybe-maybe we can wait
until louis goes to bed.

113
00:04:26,169 --> 00:04:28,169
Of course.

114
00:04:28,171 --> 00:04:29,804
So run along to bed, dear.

115
00:04:29,806 --> 00:04:30,972
Mom.

116
00:04:30,974 --> 00:04:33,308
If you don't go to sleep,
santa won't come.

117
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:34,442
There is no santa.

118
00:04:34,444 --> 00:04:36,511
What? Of course there is.

119
00:04:36,513 --> 00:04:38,980
Santa's as real
as the nose on my face.

120
00:04:38,982 --> 00:04:40,315
(clears throat)

121
00:04:40,317 --> 00:04:44,085
Well, he's as real as my...

122
00:04:46,222 --> 00:04:48,523
Trust me, he's real.

123
00:04:48,525 --> 00:04:52,527
You know, she's right, and
tonight we're gonna prove it,

124
00:04:52,529 --> 00:04:56,130
Because we got
a santa cam,

125
00:04:56,132 --> 00:05:00,134
So we can catch
the big man in red on video.

126
00:05:00,136 --> 00:05:02,136
Santa claus!

127
00:05:02,138 --> 00:05:03,404
Old saint nick!

128
00:05:03,406 --> 00:05:05,373
(french accent):
Papa noel.

129
00:05:05,375 --> 00:05:07,375
(italian accent):
Babbo natale.

130
00:05:07,377 --> 00:05:09,410
(german accent):
Weihnachtsmann.

131
00:05:10,913 --> 00:05:14,015
Which, of course,
means "christmas man" in german.

132
00:05:14,017 --> 00:05:16,084
Teachable moment.

133
00:05:16,086 --> 00:05:18,152
The-the point is,
in the morning,

134
00:05:18,154 --> 00:05:20,088
When you see
him on video,

135
00:05:20,090 --> 00:05:22,156
Then you'll believe
he's real, right?

136
00:05:22,158 --> 00:05:23,024
I guess.

137
00:05:23,026 --> 00:05:26,160
I guess? What?

138
00:05:26,162 --> 00:05:29,230
Did you hear that, alan?
Did you hear that, evelyn?

139
00:05:29,232 --> 00:05:30,732
(imitating jimmy stewart):
You hear that, clarence?

140
00:05:30,734 --> 00:05:33,167
Merry christmas, you wonderful
old building and loan!

141
00:05:33,169 --> 00:05:36,604
Okay, off to bed you go.

142
00:05:36,606 --> 00:05:39,073
And soon, you'll have
visions of sugar plums

143
00:05:39,075 --> 00:05:41,242
Dancing in your head.

144
00:05:41,244 --> 00:05:43,544
Can I have some pirate rum?

145
00:05:43,546 --> 00:05:45,546
No, we don't want visions

146
00:05:45,548 --> 00:05:48,116
Of pink elephants
dancing in our head.

147
00:05:48,118 --> 00:05:52,420
Okay, you go brush your teeth,
and I'll be in in a minute.

148
00:05:52,422 --> 00:05:54,088
When alan was little
and couldn't sleep,

149
00:05:54,090 --> 00:05:55,857
I used to give him whiskey.

150
00:05:55,859 --> 00:05:58,760
Breast-feeding
doesn't count, mother.

151
00:05:58,762 --> 00:06:01,296
So here's the plan.

152
00:06:01,298 --> 00:06:03,431
Santa's not actually coming.

153
00:06:03,433 --> 00:06:05,066
You don't say.

154
00:06:05,068 --> 00:06:06,601
But how awesome is this?

155
00:06:06,603 --> 00:06:09,771
We got the number two guy from
the thanksgiving day parade.

156
00:06:09,773 --> 00:06:11,272
So, if the giant

157
00:06:11,274 --> 00:06:13,975
Bullwinkle balloon breaks loose
and kills the number one santa,

158
00:06:13,977 --> 00:06:15,376
This is the guy.

159
00:06:15,378 --> 00:06:16,644
Alan:
Yeah.

160
00:06:16,646 --> 00:06:18,112
He also appeared as santa

161
00:06:18,114 --> 00:06:20,481
On an episode of
walker, texas ranger.

162
00:06:22,451 --> 00:06:26,688
He and chuck norris fought the
bad guys with christmas fu.

163
00:06:28,157 --> 00:06:29,991
So, when he gets here,
he's gonna take the presents

164
00:06:29,993 --> 00:06:32,260
That we bought for him, and he's
gonna put them under the tree,

165
00:06:32,262 --> 00:06:33,895
And then we'll get it on video,

166
00:06:33,897 --> 00:06:37,732
And then louis will have the
perfect charlie brown christmas.

what we're gonna do is

200
00:07:53,209 --> 00:07:55,543
Film you putting the presents
under the tree.

201
00:07:55,545 --> 00:07:57,745
Uh, and then I've written
a little something

202
00:07:57,747 --> 00:07:59,380
For you to say to louis.

203
00:07:59,382 --> 00:08:00,581

Okay, okay, okay,
and then...

208
00:08:08,591 --> 00:08:11,059
Then you'll take a
bite of the cookie,

209
00:08:11,061 --> 00:08:14,362
You'll crunch the carrot,
you'll sip the milk,

Wink at the camera, jiggle
your belly and leave.

00:14:45,588 --> 00:14:47,655
All right, time for bed, bud.

356
00:14:47,657 --> 00:14:49,657
That's right.
Santa's on his way.
All right.

357
00:14:49,659 --> 00:14:51,091
If santa is real,

358
00:14:51,093 --> 00:14:53,761
Then how does he get in all
the kids' houses in one night?

359
00:14:53,763 --> 00:14:57,231
Well, he's got
christmas magic.

360
00:14:57,233 --> 00:14:59,633
And how does he know
where everybody lives?

361
00:14:59,635 --> 00:15:03,671
Well... That's the magic
of google maps.

362
00:15:03,673 --> 00:15:05,506
All right.

363
00:15:05,508 --> 00:15:07,975
Good night, buddy.
Time to go to sleep.

364
00:15:07,977 --> 00:15:10,578
Can you guys stay with me
till I fall asleep?

365
00:15:11,847 --> 00:15:13,848
Sure.
Yeah.

366
00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:17,885
It's not like we need to help
santa assemble toys.

367
00:15:18,987 --> 00:15:22,156
He pays his elves
$75 to do that.

368
00:15:24,092 --> 00:15:25,993
That's timothy's spot.

369
00:15:25,995 --> 00:15:27,695
Oh, oh, okay.

370
00:15:27,697 --> 00:15:28,796
Um...

371
00:15:28,798 --> 00:15:30,865
I guess, uh...

372
00:15:41,376 --> 00:15:42,910

What the...

386
00:16:15,044 --> 00:16:17,478
Santa came! He is real!

387
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:18,679
Did you...?

388
00:16:18,681 --> 00:16:20,014
No.

389
00:16:20,016 --> 00:16:21,749
He's on the video.

390
00:16:23,585 --> 00:16:28,889
You didn't see grandma evelyn
wrestling with santa, did you?

391
00:16:28,891 --> 00:16:31,425
No, just santa.

392
00:16:31,427 --> 00:16:33,494
Alan:
That's...

393
00:16:33,496 --> 00:16:35,829
Santa.

394
00:16:35,831 --> 00:16:37,231
Oh, my god.

395
00:16:37,233 --> 00:16:39,533
If the easy bake oven
I have always wanted

396
00:16:39,535 --> 00:16:42,870
Is under that tree,
it is gonna blow my mind.

397
00:16:42,872 --> 00:16:44,838
Can I go outside
and ride my bike?

398
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:46,907
Sure.

399
00:16:46,909 --> 00:16:48,342
Alan, do you
want to...?

400
00:16:48,344 --> 00:16:49,743
Oh, yeah. Absolutely.

401
00:16:49,745 --> 00:16:51,912
Uh, let's go, buddy.
(chuckles)

402
00:16:51,914 --> 00:16:53,881
Looks like we had
a great christmas

403
00:16:53,883 --> 00:16:55,950
And saved $75.

404
00:17:11,933 --> 00:17:14,602
Rose?

405
00:17:14,604 --> 00:17:16,804
All right, come on, rose,
I know you're down there.

406
00:17:16,806 --> 00:17:17,938
Actually, I'm
behind you.

407
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:19,540
Ah, son of a...!

408
00:17:19,542 --> 00:17:22,109
How do you do that?

409
00:17:22,111 --> 00:17:23,911
Why do you do that?

410
00:17:23,913 --> 00:17:26,480
Oh, a girl's got to have
a little fun.

411
00:17:26,482 --> 00:17:28,282
Merry christmas.

412
00:17:28,284 --> 00:17:31,418
I-I cannot believe that you
went to all that trouble for us.

413
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:34,755
You mean you can't believe
santa went to all that trouble.

414
00:17:34,757 --> 00:17:36,757
Okay, then I guess

415
00:17:36,759 --> 00:17:39,760
I need to say
thank you to santa.

416
00:17:39,762 --> 00:17:41,829
Well, he doesn't
do it for the thanks,

417
00:17:41,831 --> 00:17:43,597
He does it because
he genuinely wants

418
00:17:43,599 --> 00:17:45,733
To make the people
in his life happy.

419
00:17:46,835 --> 00:17:48,168
Are you happy, walden?

420
00:17:48,170 --> 00:17:49,937
I am.

421
00:17:49,939 --> 00:17:52,806
I-I couldn't have imagined
a better christmas morning.

422
00:17:52,808 --> 00:17:56,910
I mean, other than waking up
with alan poking me in the back.

423
00:17:56,912 --> 00:17:59,146
Listen, I...

424
00:17:59,148 --> 00:18:02,950
I'm sorry that I said
I didn't want you around.

425
00:18:02,952 --> 00:18:04,118
Oh, please.

426
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:05,919
It's not like every time
somebody says

427
00:18:05,921 --> 00:18:08,489
Something mean to me, I write
it down in a big book called

428
00:18:08,491 --> 00:18:10,858
"those who have wronged me."
(chuckles)

429
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:12,860
That's funny.

430
00:18:12,862 --> 00:18:14,461
I think.

431
00:18:14,463 --> 00:18:18,999
Well, I told you before,
I just want to be your friend.

432
00:18:19,001 --> 00:18:21,001
Well, you are.

433
00:18:21,003 --> 00:18:22,803
And...

434
00:18:22,805 --> 00:18:24,972
I'm sorry if I forgot that.

435
00:18:24,974 --> 00:18:26,674
Oh.

436
00:18:26,676 --> 00:18:28,375
(chuckles)

437
00:18:28,377 --> 00:18:30,377
Oh, hey, but how did santa

438
00:18:30,379 --> 00:18:32,513
Manage to put
that bike together?

439
00:18:32,515 --> 00:18:35,449
The instructions couldn't
have been any clearer.

440
00:18:35,451 --> 00:18:37,718
"the bolts of turning
shall revolve clockwords

441
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:39,319
As in above figure below."

442
00:18:39,321 --> 00:18:41,655
(chuckles)
duh.

443
00:18:41,657 --> 00:18:45,225
Yeah. Duh.

444
00:18:45,227 --> 00:18:47,494
Do you guys have
big plans for later?

445
00:18:47,496 --> 00:18:49,463
Uh, no, just the usual.

446
00:18:49,465 --> 00:18:51,832
Open gifts, call family,

447
00:18:51,834 --> 00:18:53,867
Hope that you get
their voice mail.

448
00:18:53,869 --> 00:18:56,036
Oh, the best part is
alan's gonna deep-fry a turkey,

449
00:18:56,038 --> 00:18:58,972
So there's a 50/50 chance
he'll catch himself on fire.

450
00:18:58,974 --> 00:19:00,841
Oh, I got you guys

451
00:19:00,843 --> 00:19:03,844
A little something
for the house.

452
00:19:03,846 --> 00:19:05,813
And I hope that every time
you look at it,

453
00:19:05,815 --> 00:19:07,047
You'll think of me.

454
00:19:07,049 --> 00:19:08,716
(chuckles)

455
00:19:08,718 --> 00:19:11,385
Oh! A cuckoo clock.

456
00:19:11,387 --> 00:19:13,087
I get it. 'cause you're...

457
00:19:13,089 --> 00:19:14,088

(chuckles)

459
00:19:15,157 --> 00:19:16,457
What?

460
00:19:17,726 --> 00:19:19,727
No.

461
00:19:19,729 --> 00:19:22,062
Because it's red like a rose.

462
00:19:23,031 --> 00:19:25,032
How could you
hurt me on christmas?

463
00:19:25,034 --> 00:19:26,900
I'm sorry. I-I...

464
00:19:26,902 --> 00:19:29,002
I thought it was...
Oh, I'm just kidding.

465
00:19:29,004 --> 00:19:31,939
No, it's totally
'cause I'm cuckoo.

466
00:19:32,841 --> 00:19:35,275
Well, merry christmas, walden.

467
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:41,248

It's a tiny rose.
