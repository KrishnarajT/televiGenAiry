00:00:01,803 --> 00:00:03,471
Previously on
two and a half men...

2
00:00:03,773 --> 00:00:05,473
Yeah, I see hundreds
of potential parents,

3
00:00:05,475 --> 00:00:06,808
But you two are
different somehow.

4
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:08,343
I know we can be
good parents.

5
00:00:08,345 --> 00:00:10,111
It is my job to be
a hundred percent sure

6
00:00:10,113 --> 00:00:11,279
Before I place a child.

7
00:00:11,281 --> 00:00:13,281
We are not believable
as a loving couple,

8
00:00:13,283 --> 00:00:16,084
And I think that's why ms.
Mcmartin wasn't sure about us.

9
00:00:16,086 --> 00:00:19,520
All right, yeah.

10
00:00:19,522 --> 00:00:21,856
We do that in front of ms.
Mcmartin, we'll get ten babies.

Whew.

13
00:00:27,864 --> 00:00:30,531
That was like
a roller coaster.

14
00:00:30,533 --> 00:00:33,868
Yeah, we went up,
we went down.

15
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:36,304
There was the
loop-de-loop.

16
00:00:36,306 --> 00:00:38,439
Yeah, they-they say you want
to sit in the front,

17
00:00:38,441 --> 00:00:40,341
But I had a great time
in the back.

18
00:00:40,343 --> 00:00:42,343
Yeah, you know, I'm not sure
about that picture

19
00:00:42,345 --> 00:00:43,511
We took at the end.

20
00:00:43,513 --> 00:00:45,146
I think I was making
a funny face.

21
00:00:45,148 --> 00:00:47,515
Yeah.

22
00:00:47,517 --> 00:00:50,351
Hey, have you ever gotten busy
in a public place,

23
00:00:50,353 --> 00:00:52,387
Like a theme park,
before?

24
00:00:52,389 --> 00:00:55,056
I mean, uh, there was one
time in the chicago airport.

25
00:00:55,058 --> 00:00:58,059
I met this girl
on a long layover.

26
00:00:58,061 --> 00:01:01,996
Let's just say my bag was
never left unattended.

27
00:01:01,998 --> 00:01:04,432
What about you?

28
00:01:04,434 --> 00:01:08,436
Well, if you get me
a hot cup of coffee,

29
00:01:08,438 --> 00:01:12,307
I'll, uh, tell you about my high
school trip to mount rushmore.

30
00:01:12,309 --> 00:01:15,310
Okay, please tell me it
doesn't involve four old guys

31
00:01:15,312 --> 00:01:17,211
On top of a mountain.

32
00:01:17,213 --> 00:01:20,481
I went to
an all-girls school.

33
00:01:20,483 --> 00:01:22,483
Coffee, coming up!

34
00:01:24,787 --> 00:01:27,255
Oh, hey.
Hey.

35
00:01:27,257 --> 00:01:28,890
Okay, I don't know
what was going on

36
00:01:28,892 --> 00:01:30,091
Up there with
laurel, but...

37
00:01:34,296 --> 00:01:37,298
Rich, handsome and a master
of the boudoir.

38
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:39,767
You're everything
I think I am when I'm drunk.

39
00:01:39,769 --> 00:01:41,202
What can I say?

40
00:01:41,204 --> 00:01:43,838
I got a magical tongue, and
I can breathe through my ears.

41
00:01:45,441 --> 00:01:48,443
Were you just sitting down here,
listening to laurel and me?

42
00:01:48,445 --> 00:01:51,112
(doorbell rings)
no, that would be sad.

43
00:01:51,114 --> 00:01:52,714
I was also couponing.

44
00:01:56,986 --> 00:01:58,319
Hey.

45
00:01:58,321 --> 00:01:59,954
How's my favorite
couple?

46
00:01:59,956 --> 00:02:03,024
My bros without hos.

47
00:02:03,026 --> 00:02:05,026
Ms. Mcmartin, uh...

48
00:02:05,028 --> 00:02:06,394
What are you doing here?

49
00:02:06,396 --> 00:02:08,763
Well, I told you guys
the state requires

50
00:02:08,765 --> 00:02:12,433
A couple surprise inspections to
check in on louis's home life.

51
00:02:12,435 --> 00:02:13,568
Surprise!

52
00:02:14,837 --> 00:02:16,504
I am definitely
surprised.

53
00:02:16,506 --> 00:02:18,239
Clearly...
Captain underpants.

54
00:02:18,241 --> 00:02:19,407
Oh.

55
00:02:19,409 --> 00:02:21,109
Right, yeah, well,
I wasn't expect...

56
00:02:21,111 --> 00:02:24,579
You know, louis isn't here; he's
actually, he's at a sleepover.

57
00:02:24,581 --> 00:02:27,548
So, I guess you came all this
way to see me in my skivvies.

58
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:28,883
(chuckles)

59
00:02:28,885 --> 00:02:30,952

63
00:02:39,462 --> 00:02:41,629
Uh, well, it was, uh,
it was good to see you.

64
00:02:41,631 --> 00:02:43,798
Oh, actually, I can just
talk to you guys.

65
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,767
Great, even better.

67
00:02:46,936 --> 00:02:48,269
Uh, you know,
I'm gonna run upstairs

68
00:02:48,271 --> 00:02:49,370
And put on some pants.

69
00:02:49,372 --> 00:02:50,605
Laurel:
Walden?

70
00:02:52,975 --> 00:02:53,941
Who was that?

71
00:02:53,943 --> 00:02:56,077
Oh, that was my pants.

72
00:02:57,279 --> 00:02:58,746
Here I come, pants!

73

stay there!

74
00:02:59,916 --> 00:03:01,115
What are you talking about?

75
00:03:01,117 --> 00:03:02,850
Oh, hi. Sorry.

76
00:03:02,852 --> 00:03:04,385
What's going on?

77
00:03:04,387 --> 00:03:05,887
Uh...

78
00:03:05,889 --> 00:03:08,823
You're cheating
on me?

79
00:03:10,059 --> 00:03:11,993

placed louis here had I known

85
00:03:28,645 --> 00:03:30,311
You guys weren't
actually a couple.

86
00:03:30,313 --> 00:03:32,480
I can explain.
Oh, go ahead,
I'd love to hear it.

87
00:03:32,482 --> 00:03:34,082
She's my sister.

Is putting on

96
00:03:51,668 --> 00:03:53,134
A little show?

97
00:03:53,136 --> 00:03:55,336
Every time I see this one,
he acts like he's auditioning

98
00:03:55,338 --> 00:03:56,337

Listen, we may
not be gay,

109
00:04:16,993 --> 00:04:18,693
But we are definitely
a stable couple.

110
00:04:18,695 --> 00:04:20,595
Yeah, until the adoption
is final,

111
00:04:20,597 --> 00:04:22,029
And then you'll,
what, get divorced?

112
00:04:22,031 --> 00:04:23,097
Are you kidding me?

113
00:04:23,099 --> 00:04:24,365
If this one
has his way,

114
00:04:24,367 --> 00:04:26,400
He's gonna be with me
for the rest of my life.

115
00:04:26,402 --> 00:04:27,635
Alan:
Longer.

116
00:04:27,637 --> 00:04:29,604
I bought us side-by-side
cemetery plots.

117
00:04:29,606 --> 00:04:30,938
No, he's not kidding.

118
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:32,940
And he gave it to
me for my birthday,

119
00:04:32,942 --> 00:04:34,275
And I pretended
to like it,

120
00:04:34,277 --> 00:04:36,144
Because that's what
loving couples do.

121
00:04:37,446 --> 00:04:38,880
You pretended to like it?

122
00:04:38,882 --> 00:04:40,314
See that?
See, that's real.

123
00:04:40,316 --> 00:04:42,817
And I'm gonna hear about it
for the rest of the night.

124
00:04:44,186 --> 00:04:45,486
Y-you want to take louis
away from us

125
00:04:45,488 --> 00:04:46,721
Just because we don't
have sex?

126
00:04:46,723 --> 00:04:48,022
I mean, I can
honestly tell you

127
00:04:48,024 --> 00:04:49,724
That we have
as much sex as I had

128
00:04:49,726 --> 00:04:50,958
In either of
my previous marriages.

129
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,560
None of that matters.

130
00:04:52,562 --> 00:04:54,395
N-no, of course
it matters.

131
00:04:54,397 --> 00:04:55,997
Because we're
not lying.

132
00:04:55,999 --> 00:04:58,666
We are best friends,
and we are married.

133
00:04:58,668 --> 00:05:00,401
And we do love
each other.

134
00:05:00,403 --> 00:05:02,904
And I'm sorry, but just, you
know, how many people can say

135
00:05:02,906 --> 00:05:05,039
That they are married
to their best friend?

136
00:05:06,375 --> 00:05:09,076
Alan harper-schmidt can.

137
00:05:09,078 --> 00:05:12,580
My job is to do what's in
the best interest of the child.

138
00:05:12,582 --> 00:05:14,315
Now I have to reevaluate
what that is.

139
00:05:14,317 --> 00:05:15,483
But him living here...

140
00:05:15,485 --> 00:05:17,084
No, I don't want to hear
anything else from you guys.

141
00:05:17,086 --> 00:05:18,219
I'll be in touch.

142
00:05:20,522 --> 00:05:22,523
I can't lose this kid.

143
00:05:22,525 --> 00:05:24,959
D-don't go there.
Nothing's been decided yet.

144
00:05:24,961 --> 00:05:26,627
Well, other than
the fact

145
00:05:26,629 --> 00:05:29,564
That you don't want
to be buried next to me.

146
00:05:29,566 --> 00:05:31,899
This is a disaster.

147
00:05:31,901 --> 00:05:33,734
We're gonna lose everything
that we worked for

148
00:05:33,736 --> 00:05:35,736

And you ask why
you're wonder woman.

178
00:06:39,869 --> 00:06:42,336
Hey, why don't you go
and get your shoes on,

179
00:06:42,338 --> 00:06:43,704
And we'll get
going, okay?

180
00:06:43,706 --> 00:06:45,039
Cool!

181
00:06:45,041 --> 00:06:46,741
You're the best
dad ever.

182
00:06:46,743 --> 00:06:48,676
Oh, my god.

183
00:06:48,678 --> 00:06:49,844
Did you hear that?

184
00:06:49,846 --> 00:06:51,012
He used the "d" word.

185
00:06:51,014 --> 00:06:53,014
I more than heard it, I felt it.

186
00:06:53,016 --> 00:06:54,682
But I am not gonna cry.

187
00:06:54,684 --> 00:06:55,850
That's right.

188
00:06:55,852 --> 00:06:58,119
We got to stay strong
in front of the kid.

189
00:06:58,121 --> 00:07:01,188
We can't let him know
something's going on.

190
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:03,991
(voice breaking): 'cause that's
what a... A good dad does.

191
00:07:03,993 --> 00:07:06,060
I'm gonna go get
my jacket.

192
00:07:07,763 --> 00:07:09,430
I feel so bad for him.

193
00:07:09,432 --> 00:07:11,165
Well, what are you gonna
do about it?

194
00:07:11,167 --> 00:07:13,100
There's nothing I can do.

195
00:07:13,102 --> 00:07:15,770
Just gonna throw in the towel
before the first round?

196
00:07:15,772 --> 00:07:16,971
What?

197
00:07:16,973 --> 00:07:19,607
Let me put it in terms
you'll understand.

198
00:07:19,609 --> 00:07:22,710
You're crapping your tutu
before the ballet starts.

199
00:07:24,112 --> 00:07:26,113
After all that walden's
done for you,

200
00:07:26,115 --> 00:07:29,483
You have to help him
keep ahold of louis.

201
00:07:29,485 --> 00:07:31,385
How?
I don't know.

202
00:07:31,387 --> 00:07:34,789
But if there is anybody
in the world that can figure out

203
00:07:34,791 --> 00:07:38,159
How to keep somebody
in this house, it's you.

204
00:07:39,127 --> 00:07:41,195
♪ men. ♪

205
00:07:49,805 --> 00:07:51,806
Um, is this
seat taken?

206
00:07:51,808 --> 00:07:53,674
Uh, actually, no, it's...

207
00:07:54,676 --> 00:07:56,477
What are you doing here?

208
00:07:56,479 --> 00:07:57,812
Did you follow me?

209
00:07:57,814 --> 00:07:58,979
No.

210
00:07:58,981 --> 00:08:01,215
But I knew you were here
because of the picture

211
00:08:01,217 --> 00:08:02,550
You posted of
your bruschetta.

212
00:08:02,552 --> 00:08:04,518
This is completely
inappropriate.

213
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:07,221
And only jackasses
say "brew-sketta."

214
00:08:07,223 --> 00:08:10,691
Just-just hear me out, I need
to talk to you about louis.

215
00:08:10,693 --> 00:08:12,259
The time to talk to me
about louis was

216
00:08:12,261 --> 00:08:13,627
Before you lied to me
to get him.

217
00:08:13,629 --> 00:08:15,129
I only need
five minutes.

218
00:08:15,131 --> 00:08:16,297
I-I'll even pay
for your dinner.

219
00:08:16,299 --> 00:08:17,631
I mean, if you
really knew me,

220
00:08:17,633 --> 00:08:19,467
You'd know what a
big deal that is.

221
00:08:19,469 --> 00:08:20,968
Fine, five minutes.

222
00:08:20,970 --> 00:08:22,303
Thank you.

223
00:08:22,305 --> 00:08:24,038
Oh, and if you want
anything else, order fast—

224
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,806
The happy hour prices
are about to go away.

225
00:08:25,808 --> 00:08:28,042
What do you have to say?

226
00:08:28,044 --> 00:08:29,877
(sighs)
look...

227
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:32,046
Walden is really
a great guy.

228
00:08:32,048 --> 00:08:33,714
All he wanted
was to be a dad,

229
00:08:33,716 --> 00:08:35,716
And he tried everything
he could think of.

230
00:08:35,718 --> 00:08:38,386
I mean, he only married me
because I was his last resort.

231
00:08:38,388 --> 00:08:40,054
I'm like peeing in
a gatorade bottle

232
00:08:40,056 --> 00:08:41,722
When you're
stuck in traffic.

233
00:08:41,724 --> 00:08:45,626
Nobody wants to do it, but
sometimes it's your only option.

234
00:08:45,628 --> 00:08:48,295
You know what
a last resort looks like?

235
00:08:48,297 --> 00:08:51,298
Like a 33-year-old woman who
devoted herself to her career

236
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:52,967
Because she had nothing else
and then realized

237
00:08:52,969 --> 00:08:55,136
She's not even good at that
because she screwed up

238
00:08:55,138 --> 00:08:58,072
And gave a kid to two guys
pretending to be a gay couple.

239
00:08:58,074 --> 00:09:00,574
I was just named
employee of the month.

240
00:09:00,576 --> 00:09:02,977
Now I can't even use
my $25 target gift card

241
00:09:02,979 --> 00:09:04,211
Without feeling guilty.

242
00:09:05,814 --> 00:09:08,315
You are a good employee
and a good person.

243
00:09:08,317 --> 00:09:11,318
And, if it'll help, I'll, uh,
I'll buy the gift card off you.

244
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,319
Uh, what's fair?

245
00:09:12,321 --> 00:09:14,155
Ten? 15? Ten?

246
00:09:14,157 --> 00:09:17,158
You know,
the worst part of this is

247
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:19,160
I actually liked you guys.

248
00:09:19,162 --> 00:09:21,162
I put your christmas card
on my fridge.

249
00:09:21,164 --> 00:09:22,830
Now I don't even know
who you are.

250
00:09:22,832 --> 00:09:24,498
Who are those people
on my fridge?

251
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:26,567
We're the same two people
that you trusted louis with

252
00:09:26,569 --> 00:09:27,835
In the first place.

253
00:09:27,837 --> 00:09:29,170
This whole thing is
a nightmare.

254
00:09:29,172 --> 00:09:31,005
Do you realize
I could lose my job?

255
00:09:31,007 --> 00:09:33,674
I have five cats to support.

256
00:09:33,676 --> 00:09:35,342
I know, and I-I
feel terrible

257
00:09:35,344 --> 00:09:37,011
That we put you
in this position.

258
00:09:37,013 --> 00:09:39,747
Our only intent was to give
a child in need a good home.

259
00:09:39,749 --> 00:09:43,284
Well, I suppose I can't
fault you for that.

260
00:09:45,253 --> 00:09:46,921
Great.

261
00:09:46,923 --> 00:09:48,255
So...

262
00:09:48,257 --> 00:09:49,924
We're done here, we
get to keep louis,

263
00:09:49,926 --> 00:09:52,259
And I'll give you eight
bucks for the gift card.

264
00:09:52,261 --> 00:09:54,228
I wish it was that simple.

265
00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:57,498
I just don't know
what the right thing to do is.

266
00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:00,201
Okay, well, y-you don't
have to decide right now.

267
00:10:00,203 --> 00:10:02,436
Let's, uh, let's
talk about it.

268
00:10:02,438 --> 00:10:06,073
Um, uh, can I get an appletini,
uh, sugar rim, extra zest?

269
00:10:06,075 --> 00:10:08,976
You don't have to pretend
to be gay anymore.

270
00:10:08,978 --> 00:10:11,879
Oh-oh, yeah, uh,
right, uh, uh...

271
00:10:11,881 --> 00:10:13,214
Uh, make it a mojito.

272
00:10:13,216 --> 00:10:15,716
(whispers):
Skinny.

273
00:10:15,718 --> 00:10:18,052
So, uh, what do you
say, ms. Mcmartin?

274
00:10:18,054 --> 00:10:19,787
Uh, another
chardonnay?

275
00:10:19,789 --> 00:10:21,789
Eh, what the hell?

276
00:10:21,791 --> 00:10:23,757
It's not like this week
could get any worse.

277
00:10:23,759 --> 00:10:26,427
I can't believe
I'm doing this.

278
00:10:26,429 --> 00:10:28,095
I can't believe you're
doing this either.

279
00:10:28,097 --> 00:10:29,096
Oh, oh, alan.

280
00:10:29,098 --> 00:10:31,098
Oh, ms. Mcmartin.

You like her.

288
00:10:51,053 --> 00:10:52,486
Oh, no, no,
it's not you.

289
00:10:52,488 --> 00:10:55,222
Uh, although, if I, uh,
if I did have one note, uh,

290
00:10:55,224 --> 00:10:57,491
The beige granny panties
didn't exactly move the needle.

291
00:10:57,493 --> 00:11:01,695
They're nude-colored,
and they are my work panties.

292
00:11:01,697 --> 00:11:03,797
Although your use
of the word "needle"

293
00:11:03,799 --> 00:11:06,534
Is anatomically accurate.

294
00:11:06,536 --> 00:11:08,536
I am a grower,
not a shower.

295
00:11:08,538 --> 00:11:12,406
Why do I always make
such a mess of things?

296
00:11:12,408 --> 00:11:13,874
(crying):
I'm sorry.

297
00:11:13,876 --> 00:11:16,510
Don't be.

298
00:11:16,512 --> 00:11:17,912
The crying's
actually helping.

299
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,114
What?

300
00:11:20,116 --> 00:11:22,483
Um, your weeping
reminds me

301
00:11:22,485 --> 00:11:24,218
Of having sex with
my first wife.

302
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:27,054
How did I get here?

303
00:11:27,056 --> 00:11:28,889
I went to stanford.

304
00:11:28,891 --> 00:11:31,792
I turned down a job on wall
street to help save the world,

305
00:11:31,794 --> 00:11:33,994
And now I'm in bed
with an old guy

306
00:11:33,996 --> 00:11:35,863
Who can't get a boner!

307
00:11:35,865 --> 00:11:37,298

308
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:39,934
Um, actually, that is
no longer the case.

00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:51,839
She told us to
leave her alone.

Alan, when people say that
to you, they mean it.

338
00:12:56,244 --> 00:12:58,812
Remember how you're not allowed
to go to subway anymore

339
00:12:58,814 --> 00:13:01,915
And suggestively ask
for "double meat"?

340
00:13:01,917 --> 00:13:04,652
I-I was just trying
to help us keep louis.

341
00:13:04,654 --> 00:13:07,087
Okay, tell me
exactly what you did

342
00:13:07,089 --> 00:13:08,622
So I can start to undo it.

343
00:13:08,624 --> 00:13:11,025
O-okay. Um, I followed her
to a bar...

344
00:13:11,027 --> 00:13:12,760
Oh, god!

345
00:13:12,762 --> 00:13:15,029
This is like the time
that we saw kelly ripa

346
00:13:15,031 --> 00:13:16,997
Outside the grocery store!

347
00:13:16,999 --> 00:13:18,098
No. No, no, no.

No!

352
00:13:28,210 --> 00:13:29,576
No, I did not.

353
00:13:30,845 --> 00:13:33,881
I was unable
to maintain an erection.

354
00:13:35,850 --> 00:13:38,485
This has gone from bad to worse.
I might start crying.

355
00:13:38,487 --> 00:13:40,354
I wouldn't.

Or you want to forget your name?

Got anything

She won't even
take my calls.

368
00:14:12,121 --> 00:14:13,854
Well, someone
ought to tell her

369
00:14:13,856 --> 00:14:16,757
That you are the best thing
that ever happened for that kid.

370
00:14:16,759 --> 00:14:19,460
I'm just worried about

371
00:14:19,462 --> 00:14:22,463
What will happen to him if
she doesn't let me keep him.

372
00:14:22,465 --> 00:14:25,032
Being a foster kid
makes you tough.

373
00:14:26,167 --> 00:14:27,634
Before he goes, I'll teach him

374
00:14:27,636 --> 00:14:30,037
How to make a shiv
out of a krazy straw.

375
00:14:31,072 --> 00:14:32,339
Thanks.

376
00:14:32,341 --> 00:14:33,407
I needed a laugh.

00:14:33,409 --> 00:14:35,909
Yeah, 'cause I'm kidding.

378
00:14:38,346 --> 00:14:40,013
I don't want him
to leave either.

379
00:14:40,015 --> 00:14:41,615
He's a good kid,
isn't he?

380
00:14:41,617 --> 00:14:42,950
Yeah.

381
00:14:42,952 --> 00:14:45,252
If I lose him,
all I'm gonna have

382
00:14:45,254 --> 00:14:47,087
Is a five-second

383
00:14:47,089 --> 00:14:50,424

00:15:04,774 --> 00:15:06,707
You just might want to
keep that number handy.

00:15:06,709 --> 00:15:08,976
I do know a guy

391
00:15:08,978 --> 00:15:11,345
That could sneak 80 pounds
into the country.

392
00:15:11,347 --> 00:15:14,715

00:16:12,041 --> 00:16:14,041
While the grown-ups
talk for a little.

417
00:16:14,043 --> 00:16:15,209
Sure.
Okay.

418
00:16:16,211 --> 00:16:18,378
You see how
he handled that?

I've thought about this
a long time,

424
00:16:33,362 --> 00:16:36,830
And nobody wanted this

00:16:40,369 --> 00:16:41,735
I have to do my job,

428
00:16:41,737 --> 00:16:43,904
And the fact of the matter is
you lied.

429
00:16:43,906 --> 00:16:45,239
You committed fraud.

430
00:16:45,241 --> 00:16:47,574

Walden:
Yes.

435
00:16:52,681 --> 00:16:54,882
The-the only thing
that we don't do

436
00:16:54,884 --> 00:16:57,451
Is, well, "love" each other.

437
00:16:59,153 --> 00:17:02,322
But if that's the only reason
that we don't get to keep louis,

438
00:17:02,324 --> 00:17:04,658

I don't put my man parts

Mostly man parts...

440

450
00:17:30,019 --> 00:17:32,653
I know you're upset.

452
00:17:34,156 --> 00:17:35,489

458
00:17:46,368 --> 00:17:49,102
And the grown-ups start yelling,
I get taken away.

know you're here?

Berta, it's okay.

466
00:18:06,722 --> 00:18:08,455
And she's not

468
00:18:13,329 --> 00:18:16,196

this isn't your fault.

finds out about this.

499
00:19:29,905 --> 00:19:31,171

00:19:34,910 --> 00:19:37,277
Oh, and, ms. Mcmartin,

502
00:19:37,279 --> 00:19:39,012
You might want to stay
away from your house

503
00:19:39,014 --> 00:19:40,614
Until I can make
some phone calls.

504
00:19:43,184 --> 00:19:44,818
Okay! Okay!

505
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:46,119
Let's put your stuff
away, buddy.

506
00:19:46,121 --> 00:19:47,387
Hey, you know what?

507
00:19:47,389 --> 00:19:48,688

Still, a touching moment.

530
00:20:40,742 --> 00:20:42,709
What do you consider personal?

531
00:20:42,711 --> 00:20:45,378
I already let you try on
my work panties.

532
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:48,448
Well... How do I put this?

533
00:20:48,450 --> 00:20:51,518
Ms. Mcmartin,
what's your first name?
