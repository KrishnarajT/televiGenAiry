[conversation, laughter]

2
00:00:07,281 --> 00:00:08,979
Thank you.

3
00:00:09,066 --> 00:00:10,763
Wow. She's cute.

4
00:00:10,850 --> 00:00:12,199
She sure is.

5
00:00:12,286 --> 00:00:13,897
She sucks
in bed.

6
00:00:13,984 --> 00:00:15,942
And not in a good way.

7
00:00:16,987 --> 00:00:18,075
Her, too?

8
00:00:18,162 --> 00:00:19,467
I-I didn't even know
she was gay.

9
00:00:19,554 --> 00:00:21,861
Neither did she,
till last thursday.

10
00:00:21,948 --> 00:00:24,821
You're like some
kind of lesbian zombie

11
00:00:24,908 --> 00:00:26,953
Infecting all
the women of malibu.

12
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:27,954
Ha!

13
00:00:28,041 --> 00:00:29,260
I like that.

14
00:00:29,347 --> 00:00:32,306
[as zombie]:
must have vagina.

15
00:00:32,393 --> 00:00:35,222
[as zombie]:
must have vagina.

16
00:00:35,309 --> 00:00:36,789
Sounds like some kind of
weird help wanted ad

17
00:00:36,876 --> 00:00:37,790
Alan would place.

18
00:00:37,877 --> 00:00:38,835
[chuckles]

19
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:41,663
So when did you realize
that you were gay?

20
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:42,664
Oh, oh...

21
00:00:42,751 --> 00:00:44,710
What's that i hear?

22
00:00:44,797 --> 00:00:47,104
Is that your own closet door
finally swinging open?

23
00:00:47,191 --> 00:00:48,888
Trust me,
if i was gay

24
00:00:48,975 --> 00:00:50,498
You'd be the first
one to know.

25
00:00:52,109 --> 00:00:53,850
You know, i think i was
in high school

26
00:00:53,937 --> 00:00:55,503
When i figured it out.

27
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:56,896
A bunch of my friends
were having a sleepover

28
00:00:56,983 --> 00:00:58,332
And we started talking about

29
00:00:58,419 --> 00:01:00,334
What it would be like
to kiss a boy

30
00:01:00,421 --> 00:01:01,509
And who was the best kisser.

31
00:01:01,596 --> 00:01:03,598
So me and my friend kimberly,

32
00:01:03,685 --> 00:01:04,991
Who was a cheerleader,

33
00:01:05,078 --> 00:01:06,950
Decided to settle it
by making out.

34
00:01:07,037 --> 00:01:08,125
A-A cheerleader?

35
00:01:08,212 --> 00:01:10,518
Let the woman talk.

36
00:01:10,605 --> 00:01:12,433
Kimberly was so hot.

37
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:15,741
I still remember
how soft her lips felt

38
00:01:15,828 --> 00:01:18,570
As she slipped
her hand under my shirt

39
00:01:18,657 --> 00:01:21,138
And kissed her way down my body.

40
00:01:23,967 --> 00:01:26,970
Must've been a strange and
confusing time for you.

41
00:01:28,406 --> 00:01:29,276
Please continue.

42
00:01:29,363 --> 00:01:32,889
She closed her eyes.

43
00:01:32,976 --> 00:01:33,846
She parted her lips.

44
00:01:33,933 --> 00:01:37,284
She arched her back

45
00:01:37,371 --> 00:01:39,852
And i whispered in her ear,

46
00:01:39,939 --> 00:01:42,986
"oh, my god,

47
00:01:43,073 --> 00:01:44,901
"kimberly,

48
00:01:44,988 --> 00:01:46,598
"i can't believe

49
00:01:46,685 --> 00:01:48,643
"these two idiots

50
00:01:48,730 --> 00:01:50,732
Actually believe this story."

51
00:01:54,562 --> 00:01:55,737
And then what happe...
Aw!

52
00:01:55,824 --> 00:01:56,869
Damn it!

53
00:01:56,956 --> 00:01:59,480
It's not that complicated.

54
00:01:59,567 --> 00:02:01,918
The first time you masturbate
thinking about the school nurse

55
00:02:02,005 --> 00:02:03,267
You pretty much know.

56
00:02:03,354 --> 00:02:06,139
Both:
oh, my god, i'm a lesbian.

57
00:02:09,534 --> 00:02:10,883
We need to start
hanging out with
girls who aren't gay.

58
00:02:10,970 --> 00:02:11,884
Or related to us.

59
00:02:11,971 --> 00:02:14,234
How 'bout her?

60
00:02:16,497 --> 00:02:17,716
Oh, i suppose i could
go talk to her.

61
00:02:17,803 --> 00:02:20,284
I think jenny was
talking about me.

62
00:02:20,371 --> 00:02:22,199
Oh, really?

63
00:02:22,286 --> 00:02:23,809
And you assume that
just because you're
rich and good-Looking?

64
00:02:23,896 --> 00:02:25,811
No, i was going to say
smart and charming,

65
00:02:25,898 --> 00:02:27,944
But if you mix all those
ingredients together,

66
00:02:28,031 --> 00:02:30,424
You make one delicious
hot guy pie.

67
00:02:30,511 --> 00:02:33,950
Well, your "hot guy pie"
is no match for my system.

68
00:02:34,037 --> 00:02:35,473
No, hold on.

69
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:36,343
Going on craigslist
and looking up "escorts"

70
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:37,257
Isn't a system.

71
00:02:37,344 --> 00:02:38,824
That is not my system,

72
00:02:38,911 --> 00:02:41,087
That is my backup plan.

73
00:02:41,174 --> 00:02:43,046
My system consists
of the three "c's:

74
00:02:43,133 --> 00:02:45,744
Connect, charm and cry.

75
00:02:45,831 --> 00:02:47,528
Works every time.

76
00:02:47,615 --> 00:02:48,399
Uh, okay...

77
00:02:48,486 --> 00:02:50,140
"hi, my name's alan.

78
00:02:50,227 --> 00:02:51,924
"that is a beautiful
blouse you're wearing.

79
00:02:52,011 --> 00:02:56,233
My dead wife was buried
in one just like it."

80
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:58,452
Yeah, my system's
a lot simpler.

81
00:02:58,539 --> 00:02:59,627
I wait for you
to finish talking

82
00:02:59,714 --> 00:03:00,977
And then i
take them home.

00:03:01,064 --> 00:03:03,240
Oh, oh, big words
coming from somebody

00:03:03,327 --> 00:03:05,155

next to me.
Oh.

85
00:03:05,242 --> 00:03:07,113
Okay, fine.
Well, let's just go see
who she likes better.

86
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:11,988
Oh, my god.

00:03:12,075 --> 00:03:14,425

Hey, do you think all women
are potentially lesbians?

92
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,097
Um, i have 30 years

93
00:03:34,184 --> 00:03:36,055
Of masturbating to porn
that say yes.

94
00:03:37,448 --> 00:03:38,710
You know,
you brag more

00:03:38,797 --> 00:03:40,320
About your
masturbating prowess

96
00:03:40,407 --> 00:03:41,626
Than any person
i know.

97

It ain't bragging
if it's true.

Ooh. Alpha bravo,
two bogeys on your six.

Why are you
talking like that?

Oh, my...
Did you have a stroke?

101
00:03:52,767 --> 00:03:54,117
It's airplane talk.

two cute girls
just walked in.

Why didn't you just say
two cute girls
just walked in?

105
00:03:59,948 --> 00:04:01,211
Roger that.

106
00:04:01,298 --> 00:04:02,734
Will you stop that? Over and out.

107
00:04:06,085 --> 00:04:07,130
Wow.
Yeah.

108
00:04:07,217 --> 00:04:08,435
They are cute.
Yeah, yeah.

109

So, uh... So what's
the play here?

110
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:12,222
Um, uh... How about
something like, uh...

111
00:04:12,309 --> 00:04:14,093
"hey, uh, those
seats are taken,

112
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:15,790
But our faces aren't"?

113
00:04:17,966 --> 00:04:19,316
How about,
"i'm walden,

114
00:04:19,403 --> 00:04:21,666
And this is my
mute friend alan"?

115

you can see my boobs.

Oh!

141
00:05:29,299 --> 00:05:30,604
So, uh, w-What do
you guys do?

142
00:05:30,691 --> 00:05:32,389
We're princesses
at a theme park.

143
00:05:32,476 --> 00:05:34,347
Really?

00:05:34,434 --> 00:05:36,175
Yeah, i play
cinderella

And she's the
little mermaid.

146
00:05:37,698 --> 00:05:38,743
Oh, well, that
certainly makes sense

147
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:40,048
Because, uh,
you "swept"

148
00:05:40,136 --> 00:05:41,833
My friend
off his feet

149
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:43,356
And-And i'm
"hooked" on you.

00:05:43,443 --> 00:05:45,750
Oh, my god,
that's funny

151
00:05:45,837 --> 00:05:47,186
Because i'm a fish.

00:05:47,273 --> 00:05:48,883
[laughing]
yes.

153
00:05:48,970 --> 00:05:50,363
The answer to the question
you're not asking is:

154
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:52,409
Because she makes
me look smart.

155
00:05:52,496 --> 00:05:56,630
Well, the answer
to the question
you're not asking is:

156
00:05:56,717 --> 00:05:57,631
Because he won't
move out.

157
00:06:02,897 --> 00:06:04,508
Morning. Oh, hey.

158
00:06:04,595 --> 00:06:05,683
How great
was last night?

159
00:06:05,770 --> 00:06:07,250
It was pretty good.

160
00:06:07,337 --> 00:06:08,729
Those girls didn't know
what hit 'em.

161
00:06:08,816 --> 00:06:10,470
What'd you use,
chloroform or tasers?

162
00:06:10,557 --> 00:06:13,169
I will have you know

163
00:06:13,256 --> 00:06:14,431
That walden and i
have dates tonight

164
00:06:14,518 --> 00:06:15,519
With two theme park princesses.

165
00:06:15,606 --> 00:06:17,390
Mine's cinderella.

166
00:06:17,477 --> 00:06:19,871
Perfect for you.

167
00:06:19,958 --> 00:06:21,960
Storybook beauty.

168
00:06:22,047 --> 00:06:23,527
And mine is the little mermaid.

169
00:06:23,614 --> 00:06:25,050
Perfect for you.

170
00:06:25,137 --> 00:06:26,486
No legs to run away.

171
00:06:29,663 --> 00:06:31,622
I'm telling you,
if we play our cards right,

172
00:06:31,709 --> 00:06:35,278
We're gonna get ourselves
some fairy-Tail.

173
00:06:35,365 --> 00:06:36,757
"fairy-Tail"?

174
00:06:36,844 --> 00:06:39,586
Because, you know,
"tail" has two meanings.

175
00:06:39,673 --> 00:06:40,544
Yeah, so does "fairy."

176
00:06:43,547 --> 00:06:44,591
Hey, guys.

177
00:06:44,678 --> 00:06:45,853

hi.

00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:47,159

Oh, that's so cool.

181
00:06:49,596 --> 00:06:50,989
You didn't tell me
your parents were gay.

182
00:06:53,818 --> 00:06:55,341
Didn't i?

183
00:06:55,428 --> 00:06:57,561
Dad and mom.

184
00:06:57,648 --> 00:06:58,692
Hi.
It's nice
to meet you.

185
00:06:58,779 --> 00:07:00,694
Uh, listen,
i gotta go.

186
00:07:00,781 --> 00:07:02,392
But you are going
to call me, right?

187
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:03,393
Absolutely.
You sure?

188
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:05,525
Yes.

189
00:07:05,612 --> 00:07:07,701
I would not lie to you
in front of my parents.

190
00:07:07,788 --> 00:07:09,790
Bye, it was nice meeting you.

191
00:07:11,009 --> 00:07:13,533
Don't be a stranger, dear.

192
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:17,320
That's not the girl you
picked up in the bar last night.

193
00:07:17,407 --> 00:07:19,147
No, she delivered the pizza

194
00:07:19,235 --> 00:07:20,671
To me and the girl i picked up
at the bar last night.

195
00:07:23,282 --> 00:07:25,806
Well, i hope you gave her
a good tip.

196
00:07:25,893 --> 00:07:28,244
Nah, she didn't come
in 30 minutes or less.

197
00:07:34,641 --> 00:07:35,555
Whoa.

198
00:07:35,642 --> 00:07:36,643
[imitates siren]

Fashion police.

200
00:07:38,254 --> 00:07:40,081
Pull over.

201
00:07:40,168 --> 00:07:41,039
What?

202
00:07:41,126 --> 00:07:42,867
The reason i stopped you

203
00:07:42,954 --> 00:07:46,479
Is it appears
your style has expired.

204
00:07:46,566 --> 00:07:47,567
You don't like
this sweater?

205
00:07:47,654 --> 00:07:48,699
I thought it
looked good.

206
00:07:48,786 --> 00:07:51,876
Have you been drinking, sir?

207
00:07:51,963 --> 00:07:53,965
This coming
from a man

208
00:07:54,052 --> 00:07:56,576
Who looks like he's been
tented for termites.

209
00:07:58,622 --> 00:08:00,711
[doorbell rings]

210
00:08:03,279 --> 00:08:04,192
Lyndsey.

211
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:05,498
Hi, alan.

212
00:08:05,585 --> 00:08:07,152
Uh, did we have
plans for tonight?

213
00:08:07,239 --> 00:08:08,675
No, i was
in the area

214
00:08:08,762 --> 00:08:09,676
And i thought i'd surprise
you with a booty call.

215
00:08:09,763 --> 00:08:12,070
Oh. Wow.

216
00:08:12,157 --> 00:08:13,724
Well, normally that would
be delightful, but... Wait.

217
00:08:15,595 --> 00:08:18,511
You're wearing cologne
and your one good shirt.

218
00:08:19,556 --> 00:08:21,732
You have a date.

219
00:08:21,819 --> 00:08:24,169
Oh, no, i-I wouldn't
call it a date,

220
00:08:24,256 --> 00:08:25,649
You know, uh, um...

221
00:08:25,736 --> 00:08:27,651
Walden met this woman,

222
00:08:27,738 --> 00:08:30,480
And she's got a friend,
really ugly.

223
00:08:30,567 --> 00:08:31,872
Mm-Hmm.
[chuckling]

224
00:08:31,959 --> 00:08:33,396
You know how
they say, you know,

225
00:08:33,483 --> 00:08:34,397
People were beaten
with the ugly stick?

226
00:08:34,484 --> 00:08:35,920
Well...
Well, you know,

227
00:08:36,007 --> 00:08:37,965
If you took a bunch
of the ugly sticks

228
00:08:38,052 --> 00:08:39,663
And built an ugly house,

229
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:42,448
When this girl
walked by,

230
00:08:42,535 --> 00:08:44,711
The house would
call her ugly.

231
00:08:46,452 --> 00:08:48,585
Alan, relax.

232
00:08:48,672 --> 00:08:50,761
You're allowed to date. Oh, really?

233
00:08:50,848 --> 00:08:52,632
Of course. I mean,
i have a boyfriend.

234
00:08:52,719 --> 00:08:55,069
Oh, thank god,
'cause this girl is
actually way hot.

235
00:08:55,156 --> 00:08:56,506
[laughs]

236
00:08:56,593 --> 00:08:57,724
I mean, you know,
not as hot as you,

237
00:08:57,811 --> 00:08:59,160
But, you know,
young-Hot.

238
00:09:00,945 --> 00:09:03,817
You've been hot
a lot longer.

239
00:09:08,387 --> 00:09:10,258
I'm gonna go.

240
00:09:10,346 --> 00:09:11,259
You sure you're
okay with this?

241
00:09:11,347 --> 00:09:12,565
I'm sure.

242
00:09:12,652 --> 00:09:14,828
Go have fun.

243
00:09:14,915 --> 00:09:17,788
Oh, that's my good old lyndsey.

244
00:09:17,875 --> 00:09:20,225
I didn't mean "old"!

245
00:09:20,312 --> 00:09:22,053
[imitates siren]

246
00:09:23,663 --> 00:09:25,883
Idiot police.

247
00:09:25,970 --> 00:09:27,493
Pull over.

248
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:34,239
God, it's great out here.

249
00:09:34,326 --> 00:09:36,284
The stars look amazing.

250
00:09:36,372 --> 00:09:38,548
Yeah, without the lights
from the city,
they really pop.

251
00:09:38,635 --> 00:09:41,464
That's why you can see
orion's belt so clearly.

252
00:09:41,551 --> 00:09:44,249
Uh, you know, if you
look under orion's belt,

253
00:09:44,336 --> 00:09:46,251
Uh, you can see
his little dipper.

254
00:09:46,338 --> 00:09:47,470
[laughs]

255
00:09:47,557 --> 00:09:48,471
Oh, my god,
you are so bad.

256
00:09:48,558 --> 00:09:49,472
[laughing]

257
00:09:49,559 --> 00:09:50,821
You're into astronomy?

258
00:09:50,908 --> 00:09:52,083
'cause i've been
into astronomy

259
00:09:52,170 --> 00:09:53,389
Since i went
to space camp.

260
00:09:53,476 --> 00:09:55,695
Also about the same
time i got into

261
00:09:55,782 --> 00:09:57,871
Getting my ass kicked
at school.

262
00:09:57,958 --> 00:10:00,874
I always wanted
to go to space camp.

263
00:10:00,961 --> 00:10:01,658
Nerd!

264
00:10:01,745 --> 00:10:03,703
I prefer "geek."

265
00:10:06,532 --> 00:10:07,577
Wh-What about you,
laurie?

266
00:10:07,664 --> 00:10:08,578
Are you into
astronomy?

267
00:10:08,665 --> 00:10:10,971
Yep, i'm a virgo.

268
00:10:11,058 --> 00:10:13,321
But i'm not a virgin.

269
00:10:14,932 --> 00:10:17,238
Both good signs
for me.

270
00:10:17,325 --> 00:10:19,806
So, uh, how did you become
a princess, anyway?

271
00:10:19,893 --> 00:10:21,678
Oh, i get that a lot.

272
00:10:21,765 --> 00:10:26,030
[whispering]:
i'm not a real princess.

273
00:10:26,117 --> 00:10:28,511
I'm also not
a real redhead.

274
00:10:28,598 --> 00:10:30,556
You'll find
that out later.

275
00:10:30,643 --> 00:10:34,255
No way, it must be great
being a princess.

276
00:10:34,342 --> 00:10:35,561
Yeah, for the most part.

277
00:10:35,648 --> 00:10:37,737
What's not so great
are the pervy dads

278
00:10:37,824 --> 00:10:39,957
Who are trying
to cop a feel.

279
00:10:40,044 --> 00:10:41,524
The other day i was like,

280
00:10:41,611 --> 00:10:42,960
"do that again,
you're gonna find out

281
00:10:43,047 --> 00:10:44,831
Where else
my glass slipper fits."

282
00:10:44,918 --> 00:10:47,399
Is it weird that
that turns me on?

283
00:10:47,486 --> 00:10:49,967
Is it weird
that's why i told you?

284
00:10:50,054 --> 00:10:52,317
So, hey, would you girls like
a little more champagne?

285
00:10:52,404 --> 00:10:53,536
Oh, i would! [laughs]

286
00:10:53,623 --> 00:10:54,275
I love champagne.

287
00:10:54,362 --> 00:10:55,581
And puppies!

288
00:10:55,668 --> 00:10:58,236
Um, what's the magic word?

289
00:10:58,323 --> 00:11:01,108
Oh... Boobs!

290
00:11:01,195 --> 00:11:03,197
Ah, the kids must love you.

291
00:11:08,855 --> 00:11:10,683
I really like jill.

292
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:13,164
I mean, she's fun, she's
beautiful, she's smart.

293
00:11:13,251 --> 00:11:14,339
And i really like laurie...
She's fun,

294
00:11:14,426 --> 00:11:17,560
She's beautiful, she's stupid.

295
00:11:17,647 --> 00:11:19,431
So, uh, what's the next move?

296
00:11:19,518 --> 00:11:22,390
I'm gonna take jill up to my
room and show her my telescope.

297
00:11:22,478 --> 00:11:23,479
What am i gonna do?
There's nothing

298
00:11:23,566 --> 00:11:24,567
In my room to show laurie.

299
00:11:24,654 --> 00:11:26,090
Yes, there is.

300
00:11:26,177 --> 00:11:27,570
You have a couch
that turns into a bed.

301
00:11:27,657 --> 00:11:27,918
She'll be amazed.

302
00:11:32,488 --> 00:11:33,184
Okay, open your eyes.

303
00:11:33,271 --> 00:11:35,665
Oh, my god!

304
00:11:35,752 --> 00:11:38,450
Where'd the couch go?

305
00:11:38,537 --> 00:11:39,886
Ah-Ah-Ah!

306
00:11:39,973 --> 00:11:42,062
A magician never
reveals his secrets.

307
00:11:42,149 --> 00:11:44,630
That's amazing.

308
00:11:44,717 --> 00:11:46,066
And for my next trick,

309
00:11:46,153 --> 00:11:47,851
I'm going to make
my penis disappear.

310
00:11:47,938 --> 00:11:49,330
[gasps]

311
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:51,202
I'll need a volunteer
from the audience.

312
00:11:51,289 --> 00:11:52,986
Ooh, pick me, pick me!

313
00:11:53,073 --> 00:11:54,379
Um...

317
00:12:00,167 --> 00:12:01,604
Oh, sorry, um...

318

Uh, my mom.

319
00:12:04,128 --> 00:12:05,085
No problem.

320
00:12:05,172 --> 00:12:07,174
I'll go put in a condom.

321
00:12:07,261 --> 00:12:10,308
Uh, uh, that's not how...

322
00:12:10,395 --> 00:12:10,917
You know what? Great.

323
00:12:14,573 --> 00:12:15,487
Lyndsey?

324
00:12:15,574 --> 00:12:17,968
Alan? Thanks for calling.

325
00:12:18,055 --> 00:12:19,491
You called me.

328
00:12:21,928 --> 00:12:23,147
Lyndsey, you're drunk.

329
00:12:23,234 --> 00:12:24,844
Alan, you're boring.

330
00:12:24,931 --> 00:12:26,193
Okay, i'm gonna go.

Whoa, whoa, wait!

332
00:12:27,412 --> 00:12:29,022
Just one thing.

333
00:12:29,109 --> 00:12:30,720
Remember when i told you
i was okay

334
00:12:30,807 --> 00:12:31,895
With you dating other people?

335
00:12:31,982 --> 00:12:32,896
Uh-Huh.

336
00:12:32,983 --> 00:12:34,158
Well, i'm not.

337
00:12:34,245 --> 00:12:35,594
You're not?

[door opens]

339
00:12:37,291 --> 00:12:38,815
I'm ready
for your next trick.

340
00:12:40,991 --> 00:12:42,688
Can i call you back? I'm...

341
00:12:42,775 --> 00:12:44,777
Going into a tunnel.

342
00:12:49,477 --> 00:12:52,872
So, what do you think
of your princess?

343
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:55,092
I think i am enchanted.

344
00:12:55,179 --> 00:12:56,484
And engorged.

345
00:12:56,572 --> 00:13:00,010
Well, let's see
about giving this story

346
00:13:00,097 --> 00:13:02,099
A happy ending.

347
00:13:02,186 --> 00:13:03,622
Uh, can you hold on
for a second?

348
00:13:03,709 --> 00:13:04,623
Oh. Oh, oh!

349
00:13:04,710 --> 00:13:06,233
Uh, not what i meant.

350
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,366
But... Big thumbs-Up.

351
00:13:08,453 --> 00:13:09,367
Oh, oh!

352
00:13:09,454 --> 00:13:11,499
It was a...

353
00:13:11,587 --> 00:13:13,327
It was a metaphorical thumbs-Up.

354
00:13:13,414 --> 00:13:16,592
Uh, and-And you work
with children.

355
00:13:16,679 --> 00:13:18,071
Is everything all right?

Uh, yeah, yeah, uh, uh,

Hang on a minute?
I've got to freshen up.

358
00:13:22,075 --> 00:13:23,381
Oh, the bathroom's right there.

359

Poop.
