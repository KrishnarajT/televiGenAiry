Hello, Walden.
Good to see you.

3
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:12,329
I would say, "Good to see you,"
but, of course,

4
00:00:12,416 --> 00:00:16,420
when I see you, it's usually
'cause things aren't good.

5
00:00:16,507 --> 00:00:19,858
Well, if things were
always good with people,

6
00:00:19,945 --> 00:00:22,121
I wouldn't have that condo
in Palm Springs.

Well, I left

who I thought I loved more,

12
00:00:34,307 --> 00:00:36,092
and then...

13
00:00:36,179 --> 00:00:37,745
I lost them both.

Well, Kate was my ex,

but the only reason
we broke up in the first place

17
00:00:43,316 --> 00:00:44,665
is 'cause she moved to China.

18
00:00:44,752 --> 00:00:46,450
Um, she's amazing.

who knocked on my door

'cause she wanted
to drink from my hose.

25
00:01:00,855 --> 00:01:04,076
Okay, let's table
the hose part for now

26
00:01:04,163 --> 00:01:07,166
and focus on the fact that you
broke up with a woman you loved

27
00:01:07,253 --> 00:01:09,386

who knocked on your door.

28

Let me ask you
something, Walden.

34
00:01:23,965 --> 00:01:25,053
Have you ever
been able to have sex

35
00:01:25,141 --> 00:01:28,056
and not fall in love?

36
00:01:28,144 --> 00:01:30,450
Only with myself.

37
00:01:30,537 --> 00:01:33,584
Well, it seems to me
you base your own value

38
00:01:33,671 --> 00:01:36,152
on who's willing
to have sex with you.

39
00:01:36,239 --> 00:01:38,066
How do you feel
after you sleep with someone?

40
00:01:38,154 --> 00:01:40,156

45
00:01:50,296 --> 00:01:51,515
No.

attempting to forge

51
00:02:02,830 --> 00:02:06,269
an emotional attachment
with your gay therapist.

52
00:02:06,356 --> 00:02:08,532
Is it working?

53
00:02:08,619 --> 00:02:11,056
A little bit.
You're extremely pretty.

54
00:02:12,275 --> 00:02:13,928
But the point is,

55
00:02:14,015 --> 00:02:15,930
you need to break this pattern.

that the next time

66

you fall in love, the emotions
that you feel will be authentic

projecting on someone

00:07:28,199 --> 00:07:29,505
Oh, yeah.

179
00:07:29,592 --> 00:07:31,202
The beach is
beautiful, isn't it?

180
00:07:31,289 --> 00:07:33,160
I wasn't
talking about the beach.

181
00:07:34,292 --> 00:07:34,510
You're not?

182
00:07:36,468 --> 00:07:38,601
Oh.

183
00:07:38,688 --> 00:07:41,212
You're talking about...

184
00:07:41,299 --> 00:07:44,215
Thank you. [giggles]

185
00:07:44,302 --> 00:07:45,825
Um... [clears throat]

186
00:07:45,912 --> 00:07:50,264
So, Walden, are-are you
a chiropractor, too?

187
00:07:50,351 --> 00:07:51,788
Oh, no. You do not
want these hands

188
00:07:51,875 --> 00:07:53,180
touching your body.

189
00:07:53,267 --> 00:07:55,356
I don't have the
proper credentials.

190
00:07:55,443 --> 00:07:59,273
I do, however, have
a note from a doctor.

191
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,145
Is that velour?

192
00:08:02,189 --> 00:08:04,191
You are adorable.

193
00:08:05,715 --> 00:08:07,412
So, how'd you hurt your back?

194
00:08:07,499 --> 00:08:11,242
You know, it might just
be easier if I showed you.

195
00:08:11,329 --> 00:08:14,027
Easy's... always good.

196
00:08:14,114 --> 00:08:15,768
That's true.

197
00:08:15,855 --> 00:08:19,772
Although some things are better
when they're harder.

198
00:08:19,859 --> 00:08:22,079
Oh, yeah, like working out.

199
00:08:24,081 --> 00:08:26,431
Or what you're
talking about.

200
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:32,437
I see how you
hurt your back.

201
00:08:32,524 --> 00:08:34,831
I hope I didn't hurt yours.

202
00:08:34,918 --> 00:08:37,747
Sorry for the scratch marks. Yeah.

203
00:08:37,834 --> 00:08:39,749
Listen, um,

204
00:08:39,836 --> 00:08:41,751
I hope you don't take
this the wrong way...

205
00:08:41,838 --> 00:08:45,885
Oh. I think taking it the wrong
way is what fixed my back.

206
00:08:45,972 --> 00:08:48,627
Actually, that was an accident,
but it worked out for everyone.

207
00:08:48,714 --> 00:08:50,063
Anyway, I...

208
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:53,676
I recognize that
what we just shared

209
00:08:53,763 --> 00:08:57,244
is something
very intimate,

210
00:08:57,331 --> 00:09:00,073
and it would only be
natural for both of us

211
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,293
to be experiencing feelings

212
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:03,424
of affection for one another,

213
00:09:03,511 --> 00:09:06,036
and perhaps develop a desire

214
00:09:06,123 --> 00:09:10,214
to share a meal or a drink

215
00:09:10,301 --> 00:09:12,085
or a couple of years together,

216
00:09:12,172 --> 00:09:13,870
but is it
possible that

217
00:09:13,957 --> 00:09:16,089
what might be best

218
00:09:16,176 --> 00:09:17,700
is...

219
00:09:17,787 --> 00:09:19,484
for this to remain a

220
00:09:19,571 --> 00:09:21,747
casual encounter?

221
00:09:21,834 --> 00:09:23,619
Sure.

222
00:09:25,577 --> 00:09:27,971
Really? Yep.

223
00:09:28,058 --> 00:09:29,929
'Cause i-if you want
to get a cup of coffee...

224
00:09:30,016 --> 00:09:31,627
Oh, I got to go pick up my kids
from soccer. Thanks, Walden.

225
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:35,848
Aw. What a good mom.

226
00:09:38,634 --> 00:09:41,114
Oh, good, Mrs. Butler,
I am so sorry I'm late.

227
00:09:41,201 --> 00:09:42,289
Oh, don't worry about it.
It's fine.

228
00:09:42,376 --> 00:09:44,248
Uh, no, no, no, it's not. Uh,

229
00:09:44,335 --> 00:09:46,163
we still have a half an hour.
Any kinks you need worked out?

230
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:49,035
Oh, trust me, the next time
I'm feel kinky, I'll be back.

231
00:09:49,122 --> 00:09:51,124
Here you go. Oh.

232
00:09:51,211 --> 00:09:52,430
But I-I didn't... Oh, don't worry about
it. I got to run.

233
00:09:52,517 --> 00:09:55,041
Okay, well, c-come again.

234
00:09:55,128 --> 00:09:56,782
Oh, I will.

235
00:09:59,698 --> 00:10:01,482
Sadly, it's not
the first time a woman

236
00:10:01,569 --> 00:10:03,180
has paid me not to touch her.

237
00:10:06,705 --> 00:10:09,142
♪ Men. ♪

238
00:10:09,229 --> 00:10:10,230
Morning.

239
00:10:10,317 --> 00:10:11,928
I had sex yesterday.

240
00:10:12,015 --> 00:10:14,670
Congratulations.
When's the wedding?

241
00:10:14,757 --> 00:10:16,759
Oh. [mock laughs] No.

242
00:10:16,846 --> 00:10:18,108
This was different.

243
00:10:18,195 --> 00:10:19,675
If the kind of sex I had
was a suit,

244
00:10:19,762 --> 00:10:22,286
it would be made of linen,
because it was

245
00:10:22,373 --> 00:10:24,505
so casual.

246
00:10:26,203 --> 00:10:26,856
You? Really?

247
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:28,553
[chuckles]

248
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,381
I know. You believe it?

249
00:10:30,468 --> 00:10:32,470
We started having sex,
and I caught myself

250
00:10:32,557 --> 00:10:34,646
trying to make love,
and I said, "No,

251
00:10:34,733 --> 00:10:36,779
no, no."

252
00:10:36,866 --> 00:10:38,998
"This is gonna be
meaningless and empty,

253
00:10:39,085 --> 00:10:41,261
"like two wild elk

254
00:10:41,348 --> 00:10:44,482
rutting
on the Siberian tundra."

255
00:10:44,569 --> 00:10:48,529
You know, only male elk rut.

256
00:10:48,616 --> 00:10:52,490
And only lesbians
who didn't have sex last night

257
00:10:52,577 --> 00:10:55,058
point out stupid animal facts.

258
00:10:55,145 --> 00:10:57,495
[doorbell rings]

259
00:10:57,582 --> 00:10:58,626
I got it.

260
00:11:01,368 --> 00:11:04,545
Hello? Hi. Is this
Adjustments by the Sea?

261
00:11:04,632 --> 00:11:07,940
Oh, uh, actually,
today it's Adjustments by
the Closed Patio Door,

262
00:11:08,027 --> 00:11:10,769
because a, uh, seagull
pooped on my last client.

263
00:11:10,856 --> 00:11:12,989
Uh... I am Dr.
Alan Harper.

264
00:11:13,076 --> 00:11:14,555
Uh, do you have
an appointment?

265
00:11:14,642 --> 00:11:16,383
Uh, I do.
But I was hoping

266
00:11:16,470 --> 00:11:19,125
I could see
your associate, Walden?

267
00:11:19,212 --> 00:11:22,085
Oh, no, there, uh, there
must be some kind of mistake.

268
00:11:22,172 --> 00:11:24,043
Walden doesn't
actually work with me.

269
00:11:24,130 --> 00:11:28,308
According to my friend Tracy,
he worked with her quite well.

270
00:11:28,395 --> 00:11:29,875
Um, Tracy?

271
00:11:29,962 --> 00:11:32,486
She was here yesterday.

272
00:11:32,573 --> 00:11:35,533
For the... internal massage.

273
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:38,666
Oh! Oh!

274
00:11:38,754 --> 00:11:41,800
Well... well, I don't...

275
00:11:41,887 --> 00:11:43,976
know what went on
between the two of them,

276
00:11:44,063 --> 00:11:46,457
but this is not that
type of business.

277
00:11:46,544 --> 00:11:48,807
Okay, I get it.

278
00:11:48,894 --> 00:11:51,462
Maybe this will help. Oh, no, I'm not
really comfortable,

279
00:11:51,549 --> 00:11:54,160
uh, letting you stand
out in the cold.
Please come in.

280
00:11:54,247 --> 00:11:55,640
Um...

281
00:11:55,727 --> 00:11:57,903
Thank you.

282
00:11:57,990 --> 00:12:00,210
Now, um, if I want
anything special,

283
00:12:00,297 --> 00:12:02,516
should I negotiate
with Walden directly?

284
00:12:02,603 --> 00:12:04,214
Oh. No.

285
00:12:04,301 --> 00:12:05,084
No.

286
00:12:05,171 --> 00:12:06,825
No, no, no, no.

287
00:12:06,912 --> 00:12:10,089
Uh, uh, uh, Walden...

288
00:12:10,176 --> 00:12:11,395
Walden...

289
00:12:11,482 --> 00:12:13,136
considers himself
an artist.

290
00:12:13,223 --> 00:12:15,138
And as far as
he's concerned,

291
00:12:15,225 --> 00:12:16,704
you're just two strangers

292
00:12:16,792 --> 00:12:18,794
meeting in a chiropractic
waiting room.

293
00:12:18,881 --> 00:12:21,709
Uh, any mention of money
would just upset him.

294
00:12:21,797 --> 00:12:23,842
I understand.

295
00:12:23,929 --> 00:12:25,801
Yeah. Oh, and, uh,
here's a diagram
of the human body.

296
00:12:25,888 --> 00:12:27,759
If you'd like, you
can mark the areas

297
00:12:27,846 --> 00:12:30,806
that you'd like him to
give special attention to.

298
00:12:33,112 --> 00:12:34,200
Oh. Oh, my.

299
00:12:34,287 --> 00:12:36,899
Uh, "X" marks
the G-spot.

300
00:12:38,857 --> 00:12:41,599
Oh, oh, good, Walden,
uh, you're here.

301
00:12:41,686 --> 00:12:44,907
Um, uh, I need your help.

302
00:12:44,994 --> 00:12:48,301
Um, could you keep my client
company until I get back?

303
00:12:48,388 --> 00:12:49,825
Alan,

304
00:12:49,912 --> 00:12:52,131
I'm not here to babysit
your clients.

305
00:12:52,218 --> 00:12:53,132
I can do it.

306
00:12:53,219 --> 00:12:54,742
No. Uh...

307
00:12:55,787 --> 00:12:56,962
No. No.

308
00:12:57,049 --> 00:12:58,355
This is a man's job.

309
00:12:58,442 --> 00:12:59,617
I-I'll be right back.

310
00:13:03,012 --> 00:13:04,927
Hi. I'm sorry.

311
00:13:05,014 --> 00:13:08,060
Uh, Dr. Harper had to
take care of something

312
00:13:08,147 --> 00:13:09,322
really quick.

313
00:13:09,409 --> 00:13:11,368
Is there anything
I can offer you?

314
00:13:11,455 --> 00:13:13,370
Well, that depends.

315
00:13:13,457 --> 00:13:16,286
Can I offer youanything...

316
00:13:16,373 --> 00:13:18,505

00:13:24,294 --> 00:13:26,557
Well, I do see a...

So do I.

You've got a lovely place here.

321
00:13:35,871 --> 00:13:39,875
I can't wait to see
every inch of it. [laughs]

322
00:13:39,962 --> 00:13:42,790
That might take a while.

323
00:13:42,878 --> 00:13:44,444
Why?

324
00:13:44,531 --> 00:13:47,404
Is it big?

325
00:13:47,491 --> 00:13:50,798
I've been told
that it's quitebig.

00:13:53,192 --> 00:13:55,803
Wait, wait, we're not really
talking about the house, are we?

328
00:13:55,891 --> 00:13:56,761
No, no, we're not. Oh. [laughs]

332
00:14:07,511 --> 00:14:10,906

an excellent idea!

that it turned me on. [laughs]

00:15:13,403 --> 00:15:14,752
I know. I'm sorry.

357
00:15:14,839 --> 00:15:16,884
Well, look, look,
obviously, you know,

358
00:15:16,972 --> 00:15:19,844
I can't... condone
this kind of behavior.

359
00:15:19,931 --> 00:15:22,586
But, you know, if you...
if you think it's...

360
00:15:22,673 --> 00:15:25,023
helping you, I mean, that's
really the important thing.

361
00:15:25,110 --> 00:15:26,416
It is helping.
I feel so free.

362
00:15:26,503 --> 00:15:28,592
Do you know what
it's like to have sex

363
00:15:28,679 --> 00:15:30,942
with a woman who never
wants to see you again?

364
00:15:31,029 --> 00:15:33,075
Yes.

365
00:15:33,162 --> 00:15:34,815
Yes, I do.

366
00:15:34,902 --> 00:15:36,513
I appreciate you understanding,

367
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:39,124

a toll on your business.

have to do that, Walden.No, no.

Take it.No, I'm not taking
your money, Walden.

sort of happened by accident.
