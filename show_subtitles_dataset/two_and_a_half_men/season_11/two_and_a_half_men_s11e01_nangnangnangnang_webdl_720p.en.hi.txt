Tell me, Henry,

3
00:00:05,728 --> 00:00:08,545
why do you want to be
Mr. Schmidt's assistant?

4
00:00:08,547 --> 00:00:09,730
He's my hero.

5
00:00:09,732 --> 00:00:11,315
I know everything about him.

6
00:00:12,033 --> 00:00:15,168
"Possible stalker."

7
00:00:16,237 --> 00:00:18,405
And why do you think
you're qualified?

8
00:00:18,407 --> 00:00:20,791
Like him,
I graduated high school at 16.

9
00:00:20,793 --> 00:00:23,076
Then I completed the four-year
computer science program

10
00:00:23,078 --> 00:00:24,527
at Harvard
in just under two years,

11
00:00:24,529 --> 00:00:26,964
during which,
I founded an Internet startup,

12
00:00:26,966 --> 00:00:29,733
and I'm currently two semesters
shy of my law degree.

13
00:00:29,735 --> 00:00:33,670
So, "no law degree."

14
00:00:34,639 --> 00:00:35,839
Let me tell you a few things

15
00:00:35,841 --> 00:00:37,424
about Walden Schmidt
you may not know.

16
00:00:37,426 --> 00:00:38,725
The man is a genius.

17
00:00:38,727 --> 00:00:40,510
I knew that.

18
00:00:40,512 --> 00:00:43,546
"Likes to interrupt."

19
00:00:44,599 --> 00:00:47,100
He thinks in a different way
than the rest of us.

20
00:00:47,102 --> 00:00:49,219
His mind is always working.

21
00:00:49,221 --> 00:00:50,570
Every time he opens his mouth,

22
00:00:50,572 --> 00:00:52,272
it's because he has
something important to say.

23
00:00:52,274 --> 00:00:55,392
Love the new toilet
paper you bought, Alan.

24
00:00:55,394 --> 00:00:57,477
It's like sliding
down a rainbow.

25
00:00:58,646 --> 00:01:01,097
Except the pot at the end
doesn't have any gold in it.

26
00:01:01,099 --> 00:01:02,566
When you hear something
this good,

27
00:01:02,568 --> 00:01:04,034
you should write it down.

28
00:01:04,585 --> 00:01:05,736
I'm sorry.

29
00:01:05,738 --> 00:01:06,820
Who's this?

30
00:01:06,822 --> 00:01:08,322
Oh, this is, Henry Johnson.

31
00:01:08,324 --> 00:01:10,624
He's interviewing
for the assistant job.

32
00:01:10,626 --> 00:01:12,759
Assistant job?

33
00:01:12,761 --> 00:01:14,361
Hi, Mr. Schmidt.

34
00:01:14,363 --> 00:01:15,746
It's such an honor...

35
00:01:15,748 --> 00:01:17,898
Eye contact.

36
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:19,282
It's okay, Henry.

37
00:01:22,684 --> 00:01:24,369
Alan, can I
talk to you for a second.

38
00:01:24,394 --> 00:01:26,043
No problem, Mr. Schmidt.

39
00:01:28,478 --> 00:01:29,836
Tie? Really.

40
00:01:30,497 --> 00:01:31,889
Not looking good, Hank.

41
00:01:34,368 --> 00:01:35,686
What's up?

42
00:01:35,687 --> 00:01:38,421
Why are you interviewing Henry
to be my assistant

43
00:01:38,423 --> 00:01:40,690
when I just hired you
to be my assistant?

44
00:01:40,692 --> 00:01:42,909
Oh, no, no, he's interviewing
to be my assistant.

45
00:01:42,911 --> 00:01:44,210
Your assistant?

46
00:01:44,212 --> 00:01:45,528
Well, intern, actually.

47
00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:47,397
He's not gonna cost us a penny,
and he's gonna do

48
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:49,099
all the menial stuff
I don't want to do.

49
00:01:49,101 --> 00:01:51,567
Well, why don't I
just hire him for free

50
00:01:51,569 --> 00:01:52,953
and cut out the middle man?

51
00:01:52,955 --> 00:01:55,338
And in case I'm going too fast,
you're the middle man.

52
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:56,906
But I'm the big picture guy.

53
00:01:56,908 --> 00:01:59,042
See, bringing Henry
on to Team Schmidt...

54
00:01:59,044 --> 00:02:01,294
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Team Schmidt?

55
00:02:01,296 --> 00:02:02,796
Yeah, I'm gonna get
hats and shirts made.

56
00:02:02,798 --> 00:02:04,264
Well, Henry is.

57
00:02:04,266 --> 00:02:05,715
We're gonna have a new slogan.

58
00:02:05,717 --> 00:02:07,784
"No bull-Schmidt."

59
00:02:08,653 --> 00:02:11,421
"Schmidt happens."

60
00:02:11,423 --> 00:02:13,890
You're a Schmidt head.

61
00:02:16,277 --> 00:02:19,595
I hired you to be my assistant
to help you out financially

62
00:02:19,597 --> 00:02:21,564
'cause you had close
your chiropractic office.

63
00:02:21,566 --> 00:02:23,733
I didn't have to close it;
I'm in a rent dispute.

64
00:02:23,735 --> 00:02:26,603
People in rent disputes
don't fake their own death.

65
00:02:26,605 --> 00:02:28,388
Oh, I'll get that.

66
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:30,557
You are looking good today,
boss.

67
00:02:30,559 --> 00:02:32,092
That's why he got
good toilet paper.

68
00:02:32,094 --> 00:02:35,412
So my ass is clean
while he's kissing it.

69
00:02:35,414 --> 00:02:38,048
My 12:00 must be early.

70
00:02:38,050 --> 00:02:40,633
Someone who really
wanted this job

71
00:02:40,635 --> 00:02:41,835
would've taken the initiative.

72
00:02:41,837 --> 00:02:43,420

I mean, I can, but I-I can't.

99
00:03:41,459 --> 00:03:43,759
I mean, how did this happen?

100
00:03:43,761 --> 00:03:45,361
From what my mom told me...

101
00:03:45,363 --> 00:03:49,132
Ooh, can we... can we maybe
turn down the lights?

102
00:03:49,134 --> 00:03:51,150
That's the sun.

103
00:03:51,152 --> 00:03:52,818
Right, I hate the sun.

104
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:55,505
It's like God calling you
an alcoholic.

105
00:03:56,707 --> 00:04:00,326
Anyway, according to my mom,
it was love at first sight.

106
00:04:00,328 --> 00:04:01,660
They met in a bar,

107
00:04:01,662 --> 00:04:03,830
they got drunk and had sex
in the bathroom.

108
00:04:03,832 --> 00:04:07,433
It was like
a freakin' Disney movie.

109
00:04:08,652 --> 00:04:11,437
Poke-a-hot-ass.

110
00:04:13,173 --> 00:04:15,691
And where did the kid go
for the vodka? Poland?

111
00:04:15,693 --> 00:04:17,593
Look, I don't mean to be rude,

112
00:04:17,595 --> 00:04:19,896
but how do I know that you're
really Charlie's daughter?

113
00:04:19,898 --> 00:04:21,981
I mean, this could be
some kind of scam.

114
00:04:21,983 --> 00:04:24,200
I have a picture of us together.

115
00:04:24,202 --> 00:04:25,801
It's in here somewhere.

116
00:04:25,803 --> 00:04:27,787
Oh, look.

117
00:04:27,789 --> 00:04:29,071
My vagina.

118
00:04:31,342 --> 00:04:33,025
Oh, wait, that's not mine.

119
00:04:34,678 --> 00:04:36,195
Oh, that's mine.

120
00:04:38,249 --> 00:04:39,498
There you go.

121
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:41,851
This was taken
at my fourth birthday party.

122
00:04:41,853 --> 00:04:45,004
Just a heads up, I might vomit;
where's the nearest bathroom?

123
00:04:45,006 --> 00:04:46,222
Oh, right down the hall.

124
00:04:46,224 --> 00:04:47,306
Okay, I think we're good,

125
00:04:47,308 --> 00:04:48,708
but it's always nice
to have a plan.

126
00:04:48,709 --> 00:04:51,594
Anyway, this was party was
the last time I saw him.

127
00:04:51,596 --> 00:04:53,396
After that,
he just sent checks.

128
00:04:53,398 --> 00:04:55,047
He-he sent checks?

129
00:04:55,049 --> 00:04:57,233
Yeah, my mom didn't want him
to have anything to do with me,

130
00:04:57,235 --> 00:04:59,101
but he always made sure
I was taken care of.

131
00:04:59,103 --> 00:05:01,553
He never said a word
about any of this to me.

132
00:05:01,555 --> 00:05:03,573
I'm his brother, his-his blood.

133
00:05:03,575 --> 00:05:05,091
Were they big checks?

134
00:05:05,093 --> 00:05:07,026
Yeah, got one every month.

135
00:05:07,028 --> 00:05:08,394
Bastard.

136
00:05:08,396 --> 00:05:11,714
My mom just called me special.

137
00:05:11,716 --> 00:05:12,982
This Henry guy is awesome.

138
00:05:12,984 --> 00:05:15,918
Did you know I won a
spelling bee in fifth grade?

139
00:05:17,504 --> 00:05:19,705
I didn't!

140
00:05:22,342 --> 00:05:24,910
Who's this, Henry's assistant?

141
00:05:24,912 --> 00:05:29,748
Walden, this is Jenny,
my brother's daughter.

142
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:32,218
Really?

143
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,137
Hi. Hi.

144
00:05:35,139 --> 00:05:38,157
I, didn't know
Charlie had a daughter.

145
00:05:38,159 --> 00:05:39,809
Neither did I.

146
00:05:39,811 --> 00:05:42,395
He sent her checks, big checks.

147
00:05:43,397 --> 00:05:45,114
Not that that matters now.

148
00:05:45,116 --> 00:05:46,699
Every month!

149
00:05:47,768 --> 00:05:49,619
Hey, am I related

150
00:05:49,621 --> 00:05:51,971
to Abercrombie & Fitch
over here?

151
00:05:51,973 --> 00:05:55,107
No, I own the house.

152
00:05:55,109 --> 00:05:57,376
Oh. I assumed it was Alan's.

153
00:05:57,378 --> 00:06:00,413
So does he.

154
00:06:00,415 --> 00:06:02,398
So, tell us more about you.

155
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,050
Not much to tell.

156
00:06:04,052 --> 00:06:05,251
I was born in New York,

157
00:06:05,253 --> 00:06:07,336
got kicked
out of a few private schools,

158
00:06:07,338 --> 00:06:10,139
tried to become a doctor
to make my mom happy,

159
00:06:10,141 --> 00:06:12,775
dropped out, became an actress
to piss her off.

160
00:06:12,777 --> 00:06:14,176
An actress, oh.

161
00:06:14,178 --> 00:06:16,095
Your father loved actresses.

162
00:06:16,097 --> 00:06:18,064
Yeah, I was only going
to med school

163
00:06:18,066 --> 00:06:20,116
so I could write myself
prescriptions for oxy.

164
00:06:20,118 --> 00:06:22,935
Oh, your father loved oxy.

165
00:06:22,937 --> 00:06:24,787
Sorry it took so long.

166
00:06:24,789 --> 00:06:27,757
Here's vodka and two aspirin.

167
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:29,975
Thank God. Oh.

168
00:06:31,945 --> 00:06:34,146
I was wrong; I am gonna puke.

169
00:06:34,948 --> 00:06:38,034
Your father loved to puke.

170
00:06:40,488 --> 00:06:42,004
So, when I was, like, five,

171
00:06:42,006 --> 00:06:44,707
my mom married
this total loser named Rob.

172
00:06:44,709 --> 00:06:47,093
He moved in with us
and never looked for a job,

173
00:06:47,095 --> 00:06:49,278
but he's been sponging
off of her ever since.

174
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,497
Who does that?

175
00:06:53,850 --> 00:06:55,985
So, how long you been in L.A.?

176
00:06:55,987 --> 00:06:56,952
Couple weeks.

177
00:06:56,954 --> 00:06:58,104
And you got a place to stay?

178
00:06:58,106 --> 00:07:00,556
He asks, knowing full well
she's a Harper.

179
00:07:01,305 --> 00:07:03,390
Yeah, I'm crashing
at a friend's house.

180
00:07:03,391 --> 00:07:04,791
That's great. Friends are great.

181
00:07:04,793 --> 00:07:07,060
You should make
some friends, Alan.

182
00:07:07,928 --> 00:07:09,729
So, just the two of you
live here?

183
00:07:09,731 --> 00:07:11,898
Well, my son, your cousin Jake,

184
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:14,600
used to live with us,
but he's in the army now.

185
00:07:14,602 --> 00:07:15,718
Stationed in Japan.

186
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,754
Oh, that's impressive.

187
00:07:17,756 --> 00:07:18,955
Because of the time difference,

188
00:07:18,957 --> 00:07:21,224
he thinks he lives
in the future.

189
00:07:21,226 --> 00:07:22,909
Maybe we can call him
and find out

190
00:07:22,911 --> 00:07:24,694
when this headache's
gonna go away.

191
00:07:24,696 --> 00:07:26,713
Oh, and,
you have a grandmother.

192
00:07:26,715 --> 00:07:28,281
Oh, that's great!

193
00:07:28,283 --> 00:07:30,449
In theory.

194
00:07:30,451 --> 00:07:32,118
When she finds out
she has a granddaughter,

195
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,236
she's gonna have a heart attack.

196
00:07:33,238 --> 00:07:35,588
You know,
I'm gonna call her right now.

197
00:07:39,126 --> 00:07:40,426
This is it.

198
00:07:40,428 --> 00:07:42,127
This was your dad's room.

199
00:07:42,129 --> 00:07:43,929
Wow.

200
00:07:43,931 --> 00:07:47,566
I always tried to imagine
what my dad's life was like.

201
00:07:47,568 --> 00:07:50,336
It's weird to finally see it.

202
00:07:50,338 --> 00:07:53,105
I never met him,
but I heard he was quite a guy.

203
00:07:53,107 --> 00:07:55,925
I heard he was
a drunken man whore.

204
00:07:55,927 --> 00:07:58,878
Like I said, quite a guy.

205
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:01,931
So, this your and Alan's room?

206
00:08:01,933 --> 00:08:02,999
What?

207
00:08:03,001 --> 00:08:04,533
No.

208
00:08:04,535 --> 00:08:06,168
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

209
00:08:06,170 --> 00:08:07,670
We're not... I'm not...

210
00:08:07,672 --> 00:08:09,588
The... really?

211
00:08:09,590 --> 00:08:12,108
You really don't think
I can do better than Alan?

212
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:13,459
I don't know.

213
00:08:13,461 --> 00:08:16,329
Maybe he's got a huge schlong.

214
00:08:16,331 --> 00:08:18,831
Well, we're not a couple,
and he doesn't.

215
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:22,268
Which is fine.
I mean, not that size matters.

216
00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:23,335
Not that I was looking.

217
00:08:23,337 --> 00:08:24,520
I'm not gay.

218
00:08:24,522 --> 00:08:27,840
So why is he still living here?

219
00:08:27,842 --> 00:08:29,525
Well, at first...

220
00:08:29,527 --> 00:08:31,010
Then...

221
00:08:31,012 --> 00:08:32,611
I don't know.

222
00:08:33,547 --> 00:08:37,700
So, this is where your
dad used to sleep.

223
00:08:37,702 --> 00:08:39,318
I got a new mattress,

224
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:41,937
and I replaced the
carpets and the drapes

225
00:08:41,939 --> 00:08:46,042
and pretty much anything
that could absorb fluid.

226
00:08:46,044 --> 00:08:47,326
Wow.

227
00:08:47,328 --> 00:08:48,527
If these walls could talk.

228
00:08:48,529 --> 00:08:51,614
They'd probably say,
"Can I get a towel?"

229
00:08:51,616 --> 00:08:52,965
So, I mean,

230
00:08:52,967 --> 00:08:55,801
I wish there was more
that Charlie left behind.

231
00:08:55,803 --> 00:08:57,953
You know, other than Alan.

232
00:08:57,955 --> 00:09:00,222
So...

233
00:09:00,224 --> 00:09:04,209
my dad stood in this same spot,
staring out at the ocean.

234
00:09:04,211 --> 00:09:06,378
I wonder what was going
through his mind.

235
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:08,347
I wonder what he was thinking.

236
00:09:08,349 --> 00:09:09,932
Besides, of course,

237
00:09:09,934 --> 00:09:13,903
"how can I nail those two
hot surfer chicks out there?"

238
00:09:13,905 --> 00:09:16,522
Now I'm thinking it.

239
00:09:16,524 --> 00:09:18,441
Oh, please.

240
00:09:18,443 --> 00:09:21,811
With your looks and this house,
I'm sure you do fine.

241
00:09:21,813 --> 00:09:23,796
Well, you'd think that,
but the truth is,

242
00:09:23,798 --> 00:09:25,998
when it comes to women,
I've never really been much

243
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,399
of a casual sex kind of guy.

244
00:09:27,401 --> 00:09:29,251
And every time I do
get close to one,

245
00:09:29,253 --> 00:09:30,686
she ends up pulling
away from me,

246
00:09:30,688 --> 00:09:32,588
and then I wind up
back in this room,

247
00:09:32,590 --> 00:09:35,908
thinking where I
went wrong again.

248
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:37,610
Alone.

249
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:41,480
So alone.

250
00:09:46,770 --> 00:09:48,754
Oh, yeah.

251
00:09:48,756 --> 00:09:50,956
You're not gay.

252
00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:55,344
Mom, I have some news for you.

253
00:09:55,346 --> 00:09:57,580
Sit down.

254
00:09:57,582 --> 00:09:59,849
Okay, push him off and sit up.

255
00:09:59,851 --> 00:10:03,035
I know this is gonna come
as quite the shock,

256
00:10:03,037 --> 00:10:06,622
but it turns out
Charlie has a daughter.

257
00:10:07,941 --> 00:10:10,659
Mom? Mom?

258
00:10:10,661 --> 00:10:13,062
Are you dead?

259
00:10:13,064 --> 00:10:14,547
Oh, good.

260
00:10:14,549 --> 00:10:16,632
No, I know.

261
00:10:16,634 --> 00:10:18,167
I know, it's crazy, right?

262
00:10:18,169 --> 00:10:19,935
Yeah, no, she's here now.

263
00:10:19,937 --> 00:10:21,921
Well, well, come on over.

264
00:10:21,923 --> 00:10:24,423
Okay, finish first
and then come over.

265
00:10:25,792 --> 00:10:28,177
Good news.
My mother's on her way over.

266
00:10:28,179 --> 00:10:30,746
First time I've ever said that.

267
00:10:30,748 --> 00:10:32,965
Wow, insta-family.

268
00:10:32,967 --> 00:10:36,318
Uncle, grandmother,
step-hot-guy.

269
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,454
I'm sorry,
I don't know what to call you.

270
00:10:38,456 --> 00:10:40,439
Oh, step-hot-guy works.

271
00:10:40,441 --> 00:10:42,808
All that's missing is my dad.

272
00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:45,361
Actually, he's here, too.

273
00:10:45,363 --> 00:10:47,279
Follow me.

274
00:10:47,281 --> 00:10:48,747
Where are we going?

275
00:10:48,749 --> 00:10:50,433
Well, you know how sailors
get buried at sea?

276
00:10:50,434 --> 00:10:50,978
Yeah.

277
00:10:51,003 --> 00:10:53,003
I keep Charlie
in the liquor cabinet.

278
00:10:54,671 --> 00:10:56,321
Let's see.

279
00:10:56,323 --> 00:11:00,876
Johnnie Walker,
Jack Daniel's...

280
00:11:00,878 --> 00:11:02,545
Charlie Harper.

281
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:07,183
He looks different
than his pictures.

282
00:11:07,185 --> 00:11:11,303
Charlie, this is
your daughter Jenny.

283
00:11:11,305 --> 00:11:13,522
Hi, Dad!

284
00:11:14,691 --> 00:11:16,976
This seems weird. Does this
seem weird to anybody else?

285
00:11:16,978 --> 00:11:19,111
Yes, it's weird.

286
00:11:19,113 --> 00:11:23,532
Almost as weird as
when we take him to the movies.

287
00:11:26,286 --> 00:11:28,120
Charlie, I wish you were here

288
00:11:28,122 --> 00:11:31,207
to see how beautiful
your daughter turned out.

289
00:11:32,392 --> 00:11:33,876
I-I think you'd be impressed.

290
00:11:33,878 --> 00:11:35,377
I think a lot of...

291
00:11:35,379 --> 00:11:37,379
Oh!

292
00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:41,734
Oh, not again.

293
00:11:41,736 --> 00:11:43,869
I ain't cleaning that up.

294
00:11:55,545 --> 00:11:56,495
Oh. Oh, look.

295
00:11:56,496 --> 00:11:58,329
A quarter.

296
00:12:00,866 --> 00:12:02,416
Unbelievable.

297
00:12:02,418 --> 00:12:04,735
You even mooch off the dead.

298
00:12:05,921 --> 00:12:07,037
One more.

299
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:09,072
Yeah, you're
Charlie's daughter.

300
00:12:09,074 --> 00:12:10,708
You don't seem very surprised.

301
00:12:10,710 --> 00:12:13,561
Only surprised there aren't
more of you running around.

302
00:12:13,563 --> 00:12:17,515
God, I loved your dad.

303
00:12:17,517 --> 00:12:19,433
I remember the first
time I met him.

304
00:12:19,435 --> 00:12:21,869
He asked me if I knew
how to do three things:

305
00:12:21,871 --> 00:12:23,938
cook, clean and
score an eight ball

306
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:25,773
at 2:30 in the morning.

307
00:12:27,042 --> 00:12:30,110
I told him I didn't know
how to cook or clean.

308
00:12:30,112 --> 00:12:31,762
I've been here ever since.

309
00:12:33,265 --> 00:12:35,566
I'm-I'm sure you have
a story about Charlie

310
00:12:35,568 --> 00:12:36,851
that doesn't involve drugs.

311
00:12:36,853 --> 00:12:40,154
Okay. One time at Mardi Gras...

312
00:12:40,156 --> 00:12:41,655
Or alcohol.

313
00:12:41,657 --> 00:12:43,073
All right.

314
00:12:43,075 --> 00:12:45,092
Once when Charlie
was in Vegas...

315
00:12:45,094 --> 00:12:47,044
Or hookers.

316
00:12:47,046 --> 00:12:50,130
Geez, you're really
tying my hands!

317
00:12:51,233 --> 00:12:52,233
Okay, I got it.

318
00:12:52,235 --> 00:12:54,184
It was New Year's Eve,

319
00:12:54,186 --> 00:12:56,854
and Charlie was
super not drunk,

320
00:12:56,856 --> 00:12:59,874
and he was with this
crazy not hooker,

321
00:12:59,876 --> 00:13:03,193
and he decided to have
his sphincter bleached.

322
00:13:03,195 --> 00:13:05,145
Whoa! Whoa! What?

323
00:13:05,147 --> 00:13:06,113
Why?

324
00:13:06,115 --> 00:13:08,649
Because he cared about women.

325
00:13:09,834 --> 00:13:13,821
Unfortunately, it got
infected, and he needed me

326
00:13:13,823 --> 00:13:16,907
to dab a little ointment...

327
00:13:16,909 --> 00:13:18,776
I'm sorry.

328
00:13:18,778 --> 00:13:21,262
It's just that I miss him
so much!

329
00:13:21,264 --> 00:13:23,998
God took the wrong Harper!

330
00:13:27,003 --> 00:13:29,503
Where is my granddaughter?

331
00:13:29,505 --> 00:13:31,589
Did it just get cold in here?

332
00:13:32,774 --> 00:13:35,542
Oh, my God.

333
00:13:35,544 --> 00:13:37,160
Look at you.

334
00:13:37,162 --> 00:13:38,712
Mom, this is Jenny.

335
00:13:38,714 --> 00:13:41,382
Jenny, this is Evelyn.

336
00:13:41,384 --> 00:13:43,183
You are so beautiful.

337
00:13:43,185 --> 00:13:45,519
You remind me of me
ten years ago.

338
00:13:47,105 --> 00:13:49,440
Your father was
the apple of my eye.

339
00:13:49,442 --> 00:13:50,941
My greatest gift.

340
00:13:50,943 --> 00:13:52,610
My reason for living.

341
00:13:53,461 --> 00:13:54,511
Hello.

342
00:13:55,397 --> 00:13:57,197
Hello, Alan.

343
00:13:58,182 --> 00:14:02,486
I can't believe
I finally have a grandchild.

344
00:14:02,488 --> 00:14:04,371
You already have
a grandchild... Jake.

345
00:14:04,373 --> 00:14:07,625
Oh. Sure. Yeah.

346
00:14:08,693 --> 00:14:10,711
So, Jennifer...

347
00:14:10,713 --> 00:14:11,979
Actually, it's Jenny.

348
00:14:11,981 --> 00:14:14,965
Darling, you're not 12 anymore.
It's Jennifer.

349
00:14:14,967 --> 00:14:17,468
We are going to have
so much fun together:

350
00:14:17,470 --> 00:14:21,956
lunching, shopping,
taking care of those eyebrows.

351
00:14:21,958 --> 00:14:23,557
Where are you staying
while you're in town?

352
00:14:23,559 --> 00:14:25,326
I'm crashing on
a friend's couch.

353
00:14:25,328 --> 00:14:27,695
Not anymore.
You'll stay with me.

354
00:14:27,697 --> 00:14:30,097
I love you, Evelyn.

355
00:14:30,099 --> 00:14:31,398
Whoa, whoa!
If she's staying anywhere,

356
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:32,583
she's gonna stay at my place.

357
00:14:32,585 --> 00:14:34,601
And by "your place," do you mean

358
00:14:34,603 --> 00:14:37,271
the office that
you stopped paying rent at

359
00:14:37,273 --> 00:14:39,823
or the house that
you've never paid rent at?

360
00:14:39,825 --> 00:14:41,909
Look, I'm not gonna let my mom
screw her up

361
00:14:41,911 --> 00:14:43,160
like she did me and Charlie.

362
00:14:43,162 --> 00:14:45,829
Hey! I was a good mother.

363
00:14:45,831 --> 00:14:47,531
No, you know
who was a good mother?

364
00:14:47,533 --> 00:14:49,616
Our housekeeper Adela.
She even breast-fed me.

365
00:14:49,618 --> 00:14:52,252
She had just had a baby.

366
00:14:52,254 --> 00:14:54,455
And when the milk truck
is parked on the street,

367
00:14:54,457 --> 00:14:56,423
you don't go
to the grocery store.

368
00:14:57,442 --> 00:15:01,378
Besides, you-you used
to gnaw on me.

369
00:15:02,263 --> 00:15:03,881
You're gnawer.

370
00:15:03,883 --> 00:15:05,582
Nang-nang-nang-nang-
nang-nang-nang.

371
00:15:05,584 --> 00:15:08,635
You know what?
She's gonna stay in Jake's room.

372
00:15:08,637 --> 00:15:10,387
Whoa, whoa, no.

373
00:15:10,389 --> 00:15:13,023
I do not want Jake's room
to become Jenny's room.

374
00:15:13,025 --> 00:15:15,309
You know, in fact,
there is no Jake's room

375
00:15:15,311 --> 00:15:16,443
and there's no Jenny's room.

376
00:15:16,445 --> 00:15:18,095
There's just Walden's room.

377
00:15:18,097 --> 00:15:20,914
And Charlie's room.

378
00:15:20,916 --> 00:15:22,800
Why don't we let her decide?

379
00:15:22,802 --> 00:15:23,951
Yeah, yeah, it's up to her.

380
00:15:23,953 --> 00:15:26,653
Is anyone listening to me?

381
00:15:26,655 --> 00:15:28,555
Jennifer?

382
00:15:28,557 --> 00:15:29,907
Where'd she go?

383
00:15:32,077 --> 00:15:33,377
Nice job, Alan.

384
00:15:33,379 --> 00:15:36,246
You made another woman
disappear.

385
00:15:36,248 --> 00:15:37,447
Can you believe her?

386
00:15:37,449 --> 00:15:39,700
What did I do to her to
make her hate me so much?

387
00:15:39,702 --> 00:15:41,668
Nang-nang-nang-nang-
nang-nang-nang.

388
00:15:41,670 --> 00:15:44,555
Oh, oh. What, you, too?

389
00:15:44,557 --> 00:15:47,124
Oh!

390
00:15:47,126 --> 00:15:49,059
Son of a...

391
00:15:49,061 --> 00:15:50,894
Ooh, a nickel!

392
00:15:52,598 --> 00:15:54,348
This is ridiculous.

393
00:15:54,350 --> 00:15:55,599
We're never going to find her.

394
00:15:55,601 --> 00:15:57,634
I don't understand
why she ran off like that.

395
00:15:57,636 --> 00:15:59,403
I can think of two reasons.

396
00:16:02,273 --> 00:16:05,976
First I lost my Charlie,
now I've lost my Jennifer.

397
00:16:05,978 --> 00:16:07,661
You still have your Alan.

398
00:16:07,663 --> 00:16:10,164
Oh! Don't make it worse.

399
00:16:11,482 --> 00:16:13,167
Nang-nang-nang-nang-
nang-nang-nang.

400
00:16:14,769 --> 00:16:18,705
Oh, God,
my granddaughter's gone forever.

401
00:16:18,707 --> 00:16:21,542
Oh, there she is
at the bus stop.

402
00:16:21,544 --> 00:16:25,479
Oh, God, my granddaughter
rides the bus!

403
00:16:30,185 --> 00:16:32,019
Jenny, what are you doing?

404
00:16:32,021 --> 00:16:34,588
I'm trying to get away
from you people.

405
00:16:34,590 --> 00:16:36,440
Look, I just wanted to see
where my dad lived.

406
00:16:36,442 --> 00:16:38,075
I didn't want
to screw up your family.

407
00:16:38,077 --> 00:16:39,193
For the record,

408
00:16:39,195 --> 00:16:41,028
they were screwed up
long before you got here.

409
00:16:41,030 --> 00:16:42,279
It's true.

410
00:16:42,281 --> 00:16:44,198
H-Hey, if I'm screwed up,
it's your fault.

411
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,149
You raised me.

412
00:16:45,151 --> 00:16:47,584
I didn't raise you, Adela did.

413
00:16:47,586 --> 00:16:50,654
Look, I already have
a messed-up family.

414
00:16:50,656 --> 00:16:52,072
I-I don't need another one.

415
00:16:52,074 --> 00:16:53,073
Oh, we're sorry.

416
00:16:53,075 --> 00:16:54,975
This is just how
we express our love.

417
00:16:54,977 --> 00:16:57,077
Through hate. Oh, no, no, no.

418
00:16:57,079 --> 00:16:58,412
W-We don't hate each other.

419
00:16:58,414 --> 00:17:02,983
I mean, the truth is,
my mother is an amazing woman.

420
00:17:02,985 --> 00:17:05,018
I mean, she-she raised
two kids on her own,

421
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:06,970
she's a successful
businesswoman,

422
00:17:06,972 --> 00:17:10,224
she has impeccable taste.

423
00:17:10,226 --> 00:17:11,541
Thank you, Alan.

424
00:17:12,844 --> 00:17:13,894
Oh, right.

425
00:17:13,896 --> 00:17:16,847
And Alan is...

426
00:17:16,849 --> 00:17:20,100
the reason I had my tubes tied.

427
00:17:21,202 --> 00:17:24,605
Because she knew she would
never do better than me.

428
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:29,610
Please, sweetheart,
I just found you.

429
00:17:29,612 --> 00:17:30,661
I can't lose you now.

430
00:17:30,663 --> 00:17:32,696
We want you to be a
part of our lives.

431
00:17:32,698 --> 00:17:33,780
What do you say?

432
00:17:33,782 --> 00:17:36,900
Well, if I'm gonna be
a part of this family,

433
00:17:36,902 --> 00:17:38,752
I'm gonna need a drink.

434
00:17:38,754 --> 00:17:40,204
You hear that, Charlie?

435
00:17:40,206 --> 00:17:41,872
Your daughter needs a drink.

436
00:17:41,874 --> 00:17:44,591
You're looking the
wrong way, Mom.

437
00:17:44,593 --> 00:17:46,527
♪ Men. ♪

438
00:17:47,712 --> 00:17:49,579
A toast. To Charlie Harper.

439
00:17:49,581 --> 00:17:53,534
My brother, your son,
your father, and your...

440
00:17:53,536 --> 00:17:56,386
Guy who got hit by a train
so I could buy his beach house?

441
00:17:57,438 --> 00:17:58,388
Sorry, Evelyn.

442
00:17:58,390 --> 00:18:00,157
It's okay. I got the commission.

443
00:18:00,159 --> 00:18:03,143
To Charlie.

444
00:18:03,145 --> 00:18:06,280
So, is that the bathroom

445
00:18:06,282 --> 00:18:08,565
where the miracle
of my life began?

446
00:18:09,817 --> 00:18:11,151
It is.

447
00:18:12,654 --> 00:18:13,620
Want to see it?

448
00:18:13,622 --> 00:18:14,821
I do.

449
00:18:14,823 --> 00:18:16,623
Text a picture of it to my mom.

450
00:18:16,625 --> 00:18:18,575
Should be good
for some guilt money.

451
00:18:18,577 --> 00:18:20,777
I'll run interference.

452
00:18:22,163 --> 00:18:23,297
All right, everybody out!

453
00:18:23,299 --> 00:18:25,782
Woman visiting the place
of her conception!

454
00:18:27,318 --> 00:18:29,386
I can't tell you
how relieved I am

455
00:18:29,388 --> 00:18:31,555
to finally have an heir.

456
00:18:31,557 --> 00:18:32,573
Wait, what?

457
00:18:32,575 --> 00:18:34,341
She's my granddaughter.

458
00:18:34,343 --> 00:18:36,293
I want to provide for her.

459
00:18:36,295 --> 00:18:37,728
And since I wasn't around

460
00:18:37,730 --> 00:18:39,846
for the first 25 years
of her life,

461
00:18:39,848 --> 00:18:42,099
it's only fitting that
she inherit my estate.

462
00:18:42,101 --> 00:18:44,467
You weren't around for
the first 45 years of my life.

463
00:18:44,469 --> 00:18:46,320
You have Walden!

464
00:18:46,322 --> 00:18:48,622
Oh, oh, do I? Do you see
a ring on this finger?

465
00:18:48,624 --> 00:18:49,973
Don't worry, darling.

466
00:18:49,975 --> 00:18:52,359
There's a little something
for you in my will.

467
00:18:52,361 --> 00:18:53,193
A little something?

468
00:18:53,195 --> 00:18:56,029
Look, if you knew you were
gonna get everything,

469
00:18:56,031 --> 00:18:58,415
you would've smothered me
with a pillow years ago.

470
00:18:58,417 --> 00:18:59,766
That is not true.

471
00:18:59,768 --> 00:19:03,503
If I knew I had money coming,
I'd hire a professional.

472
00:19:04,923 --> 00:19:06,707
How'd it go? Great.

473
00:19:06,709 --> 00:19:08,342
I laughed, I cried.

474
00:19:08,344 --> 00:19:11,311
I peed.

475
00:19:11,313 --> 00:19:13,080
How are you guys doing
over here?

476
00:19:13,082 --> 00:19:14,631
Can I get you anything else?

477
00:19:16,584 --> 00:19:18,685
Yeah, we might need
a designated driver

478
00:19:18,687 --> 00:19:21,138
to get us back
to his beautiful beach house.

479
00:19:22,173 --> 00:19:24,308
I'll take you guys.
I get off in 15.

480
00:19:25,643 --> 00:19:27,194
Great. Thanks.

481
00:19:29,397 --> 00:19:30,847
She's cute.

482
00:19:30,849 --> 00:19:31,949
Told ya.

483
00:19:31,951 --> 00:19:35,152
Malibu beach house
gets you laid every time.

484
00:19:35,837 --> 00:19:38,155
Not every time.

485
00:19:42,328 --> 00:19:45,712
Oh, my God,
this house is amazing!

486
00:19:45,714 --> 00:19:47,948
Well, it's... Yeah.

487
00:19:47,950 --> 00:19:50,667
And look at that view.

488
00:19:50,669 --> 00:19:52,419
It's even better
from the bedroom.

489
00:19:52,421 --> 00:19:53,503
Want to see?

490
00:19:53,505 --> 00:19:54,688
Yeah.

491
00:19:54,690 --> 00:19:56,223
After you.

492
00:19:57,191 --> 00:19:58,692
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

493
00:19:58,694 --> 00:19:59,860
Where are you going?

494
00:19:59,862 --> 00:20:01,028
Up to show her.

495
00:20:01,030 --> 00:20:02,980
Oh, you thought...?

496
00:20:02,982 --> 00:20:05,682
Oh, no-no-no-no-no, she's mine.

497
00:20:05,684 --> 00:20:07,550
Next time I'll get two.

498
00:20:12,106 --> 00:20:14,558
What just happened?

499
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:16,393
Charlie's back.

500
00:20:23,401 --> 00:20:24,367
Good morning.

501
00:20:24,369 --> 00:20:25,802
No, no, not good.

502
00:20:25,804 --> 00:20:27,737
I slept in the guest room
of my own house,

503
00:20:27,739 --> 00:20:31,140
and I'm pretty sure I still have
some of your brother in my ear.

504
00:20:31,142 --> 00:20:32,542
Don't worry,
tonight I'll tell Jenny

505
00:20:32,544 --> 00:20:33,743
that your bedroom's off limits.

506
00:20:33,745 --> 00:20:35,011
No, there is no tonight!

507
00:20:35,013 --> 00:20:36,012
But she's family.

508
00:20:36,014 --> 00:20:37,213
Not my family.

509
00:20:37,215 --> 00:20:39,332
And I'm gonna tell her
she can't stay.

510
00:20:40,184 --> 00:20:42,168
Morning. Hi.

511
00:20:42,170 --> 00:20:43,419
You girls have a good night?

512
00:20:43,421 --> 00:20:45,254
Oh, yeah.

513
00:20:45,702 --> 00:20:48,620
I'm surprised I can even talk.

514
00:20:50,658 --> 00:20:53,209
You were saying? Shut up.
