1
00:00:05,272 --> 00:00:06,925
WOMAN:
Does that tickle? WOMAN 2: Oh, yeah. Oh-ho-ho...

2
00:00:07,012 --> 00:00:09,188
Oh, my God. Oh, my God! [moaning]: Oh... oh, my God.

3
00:00:09,276 --> 00:00:12,061
Oh... Oh, my God, Jenny!
Oh, my God.

4
00:00:12,148 --> 00:00:13,367
Yeah. Oh... Oh, my God.

5
00:00:13,454 --> 00:00:16,065
Oh, my God.

6
00:00:16,152 --> 00:00:18,110
Oh, Jenny!
Give it to me.

7
00:00:18,197 --> 00:00:19,808
Give it to me,
Jenny.

8
00:00:19,895 --> 00:00:21,853
Just give it to her
already.

9
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:24,378
[women continue
exclaiming, moaning]

10
00:00:27,946 --> 00:00:28,991
Hey.

11
00:00:29,078 --> 00:00:30,514
Hey. Couldn't sleep, either?

12
00:00:30,601 --> 00:00:33,430
No. Jenny and her friend
are crazy in there.

13
00:00:33,517 --> 00:00:36,128
Have you ever made
a woman scream like that?

14
00:00:36,215 --> 00:00:37,216
Once.

15
00:00:37,304 --> 00:00:38,392
I hit her with my car.

16
00:00:38,479 --> 00:00:40,829
It sounded like Jenny hit her

17
00:00:40,916 --> 00:00:43,222
and then backed over her again.

18
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:45,834
And then hit her,

19
00:00:45,921 --> 00:00:48,053
a-and then...
backed over her again.

20
00:00:49,577 --> 00:00:51,405
And then hit her...

21
00:00:51,492 --> 00:00:53,276
and then backed over her again.

22
00:00:53,363 --> 00:00:56,584
I counted eight orgasms,
not including mine.

23
00:00:56,671 --> 00:00:58,455
Hey, that's my niece. Oh, yeah,

24
00:00:58,542 --> 00:01:00,979
and out of respect to you,
I only listened to her friend.

25
00:01:01,066 --> 00:01:04,156
Yeah, me, too.

26
00:01:04,243 --> 00:01:06,289
Hey, how about
this weekend wego out

27
00:01:06,376 --> 00:01:08,291
and find some women
and make 'em scream?

28
00:01:09,336 --> 00:01:10,902
In-in your imagination,

29
00:01:10,989 --> 00:01:14,384
are they running away from you
or towards you?

30
00:01:14,471 --> 00:01:16,081
You know what I mean.

31
00:01:16,168 --> 00:01:17,474
Let's go out
and find some strange.

32
00:01:17,561 --> 00:01:21,304
I'm looking at some strange.

33
00:01:21,391 --> 00:01:23,262
Besides, I can't.

34
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:24,829
My mom's got a charity dinner
this weekend.

35
00:01:24,916 --> 00:01:27,136
Oh, she's still trying
to help the monkeys?

36
00:01:27,223 --> 00:01:30,226
Yeah, she's raising money
to expand her sanctuary

37
00:01:30,313 --> 00:01:33,316
for helpless creatures
that nobody else wants.

38
00:01:33,403 --> 00:01:34,709
Kind of like what I do for you.

39
00:01:34,796 --> 00:01:37,625
Will there be any
single ladies there

40
00:01:37,712 --> 00:01:39,496
looking to use those
opposable thumbs?

41
00:01:39,583 --> 00:01:42,238
You know, swing on my vine,
peel my banana.

42
00:01:42,325 --> 00:01:43,674
Well, there might be a few there

43
00:01:43,761 --> 00:01:45,328
that want to throw
their poop at you.

44
00:01:45,415 --> 00:01:48,810
Mm, sounds like a good cause;
I'll buy a ticket.

45
00:01:48,897 --> 00:01:51,726
They're a thousand
dollars apiece.

46
00:01:51,813 --> 00:01:55,033
Can I borrow $998?

47
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:55,817
Hey.

48
00:01:55,904 --> 00:01:57,993
Hey.
Hey.

49
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:02,519
[whirring]

50
00:02:02,606 --> 00:02:04,042
That'll work.

51
00:02:05,087 --> 00:02:06,654
You know what they say:

52
00:02:06,741 --> 00:02:10,222
once you go
Black & Decker,
you never go back.

53
00:02:10,309 --> 00:02:13,182
♪ Men, men, men, men, manly men,
men, men ♪

54
00:02:13,269 --> 00:02:14,488
♪ Ah. ♪
♪ Men. ♪
♪ Men. ♪

55
00:02:22,583 --> 00:02:24,498
Hey! Look at you.

56
00:02:24,585 --> 00:02:26,413
Where are you going
in that monkey suit?

57
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:28,023
A benefit.

58
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:29,894
For monkeys.

59
00:02:31,548 --> 00:02:33,028
How do I look?

60
00:02:33,115 --> 00:02:35,334
Like you should be
on top of a cake.

61
00:02:35,422 --> 00:02:37,206
Let me guess: you're the cake.

62
00:02:37,293 --> 00:02:40,862
No, I'm the one that gets
to blow out the candle.

63
00:02:44,648 --> 00:02:47,695
Oh, when did we install
a mirror in here?

64
00:02:47,782 --> 00:02:49,392
[chuckles]
Tell the truth, Berta,

65
00:02:49,479 --> 00:02:51,046
you ever seen
two better-looking guys?

66
00:02:51,133 --> 00:02:52,526
No.

67
00:02:52,613 --> 00:02:52,961
Yes.

68
00:02:55,354 --> 00:02:58,401
[doorbell rings]Oh. That must be my date.

69
00:03:00,621 --> 00:03:01,752
Hi, honey. [laughs] You
look amazing.

70
00:03:01,839 --> 00:03:05,364
Oh, you look so handsome.

71
00:03:05,452 --> 00:03:06,714
Wow, nice job, Walden.

72
00:03:06,801 --> 00:03:08,324
Where'd you two meet?

73
00:03:08,411 --> 00:03:10,413
Kind of a "meet cute."

74
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:12,110
I shot out of her.

75
00:03:12,197 --> 00:03:13,851
Jenny, this is
my mom, Robin.

76
00:03:13,938 --> 00:03:16,593
Mom, this is my new
roommate, Jenny.

77
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:18,290
Oh, well, it's
a pleasure to meet you.

78
00:03:18,377 --> 00:03:19,814
[gasps]
Alan,

79
00:03:19,901 --> 00:03:21,468
does this mean
you finally moved out?

80
00:03:21,555 --> 00:03:23,252
[hearty laughter]

81
00:03:24,732 --> 00:03:26,124
No, no, no,
Jenny's my niece.

82
00:03:26,211 --> 00:03:27,561
She's staying
in Jake's room.

83
00:03:27,648 --> 00:03:31,565
Well, I have my charity,
you have yours.

84
00:03:31,652 --> 00:03:34,219
I can see where Walden
gets his pretty face.

85
00:03:34,306 --> 00:03:35,569
Aren't you sweet?

86
00:03:35,656 --> 00:03:36,483
He's single, you know.

87
00:03:36,570 --> 00:03:38,833
I know. Are you?

88
00:03:40,704 --> 00:03:42,576
Okay. All right, let's...

89
00:03:42,663 --> 00:03:45,666
go save some monkeys.

90
00:03:45,753 --> 00:03:47,276
[clears throat softly]

91
00:03:47,363 --> 00:03:48,582
Really?

92
00:03:48,669 --> 00:03:50,279
Hey, just 'cause
you came out of it

93
00:03:50,366 --> 00:03:51,846
doesn't mean
I don't want to get into it.

94
00:03:56,024 --> 00:03:59,549
[scoffs] They call
these martinis?

95
00:03:59,636 --> 00:04:02,421
The only thing they're saving
the monkeys from are DUI's.

96
00:04:02,509 --> 00:04:03,335
[laughing]

97
00:04:03,422 --> 00:04:05,207
You like that one?

98
00:04:05,294 --> 00:04:09,733
No, I was just picturing
a drunk monkey driving a car.

99
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:12,562
Walden.Mm.

100
00:04:12,649 --> 00:04:14,390
Oh.

101
00:04:14,477 --> 00:04:16,392
That woman with your mom
looks just like Lynda Carter.

102
00:04:16,479 --> 00:04:17,959
[Alan laughs]

103
00:04:18,046 --> 00:04:20,091
That is Lynda Carter.

104
00:04:20,178 --> 00:04:21,484
Really?

105
00:04:21,571 --> 00:04:23,355
Wait, wait, T-TV's
Wonder Woman?

106
00:04:23,442 --> 00:04:25,532
The jewel of
Paradise Island?

107
00:04:25,619 --> 00:04:28,404
The-the shining crusader
for justice and star-
spangled hot pants?

108
00:04:28,491 --> 00:04:30,101
I-I just call her Lynda.

109
00:04:30,188 --> 00:04:33,975
And I just lost the cleaning
deposit on this tux.

110
00:04:34,062 --> 00:04:35,237
Walden.

111
00:04:35,324 --> 00:04:37,152
Lynda, you look amazing.

112
00:04:37,239 --> 00:04:38,980
Oh, my God.
The last time we saw each other,

113
00:04:39,067 --> 00:04:41,591
you barely came up to here.

114
00:04:41,678 --> 00:04:44,855
I remember those... days.

115
00:04:44,942 --> 00:04:47,118
[clearing throat]:
Introduce me.

116
00:04:47,205 --> 00:04:49,425
Robin, you told me
he was successful,

117
00:04:49,512 --> 00:04:51,819
but you didn't tell me
how gorgeous he is.

118
00:04:51,906 --> 00:04:54,386
Well, it takes
a gorgeous person
to know one.

119
00:04:54,473 --> 00:04:55,953
[laughs]

120
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,912
[nervous laughing]:
No, it doesn't. I'm Alan.

121
00:04:57,999 --> 00:05:00,044
Hi.

122
00:05:00,131 --> 00:05:03,657
This is Alan Harper.
He lives with Walden. Oh, well, it's lovely

123
00:05:03,744 --> 00:05:05,441
to meet you.

124
00:05:05,528 --> 00:05:07,748
My gay fans have always been
my biggest supporters.

125
00:05:07,835 --> 00:05:09,924
Oh, oh, no, no, I-I'm not gay.

126
00:05:10,011 --> 00:05:13,536
Oh, I'm sorry.
Transgender?

127
00:05:13,623 --> 00:05:15,538
I told you the hormones
weren't working.

128
00:05:15,625 --> 00:05:16,974
[chuckles]

129
00:05:17,061 --> 00:05:18,889
He's kidding.
Uh, I-I am very straight.

130
00:05:18,976 --> 00:05:22,066
In fact, the longer I look
at you the straighter I become.

131
00:05:22,153 --> 00:05:25,026
Well, if you'll excuse us,
I'm gonna start a fund

132
00:05:25,113 --> 00:05:27,071
to, um, save Lynda
from this conversation.

133
00:05:27,158 --> 00:05:30,074
[giggles]
It's lovely to meet you.

134
00:05:30,161 --> 00:05:33,469
And it was "wonder-ful"
meeting you. [chuckles]

135
00:05:33,556 --> 00:05:36,124
That's funny. I've never
heard thatone before.

136
00:05:36,211 --> 00:05:37,865
Don't be a stranger. Okay.

137
00:05:37,952 --> 00:05:40,215
Call me. [chuckles]

138
00:05:42,086 --> 00:05:45,002
What the hell are you doing?

139
00:05:45,089 --> 00:05:49,572
Sorry, I just wanted to put
my mouth where her mouth was.

140
00:05:49,659 --> 00:05:51,922
And I also wanted to thank
you for a lovely evening.

141
00:05:56,884 --> 00:05:57,798
Morning.

142
00:05:57,885 --> 00:05:59,669
Mm. I got to tell you,

143
00:05:59,756 --> 00:06:02,280
you gave me a night
that I will never forget.

144
00:06:04,282 --> 00:06:07,068
Don't ever say that to me again.

145
00:06:07,155 --> 00:06:08,635
I'm serious.
Meeting Lynda Carter was

146
00:06:08,722 --> 00:06:10,158
one of the greatest moments
of my life.

147
00:06:10,245 --> 00:06:11,507
I mean, she was
my first celebrity crush.

148
00:06:11,594 --> 00:06:12,943
I had a poster of her
that looked like

149
00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:16,730
the bottom of a birdcage.

150
00:06:16,817 --> 00:06:20,081
On behalf of Lynda Carter
and the rest of humanity...

151
00:06:20,168 --> 00:06:22,866
yuck.

152
00:06:22,953 --> 00:06:25,303
You know, it's not just about
how beautiful she was.

153
00:06:25,390 --> 00:06:26,914
I mean, she's multitalented.
I mean, I had all of her albums,

154
00:06:27,001 --> 00:06:29,133
I-I-I've seen everything
she's ever done.

155
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:31,440
How?

156
00:06:31,527 --> 00:06:33,050
Were you hiding outside
her house in a bush?

157
00:06:33,137 --> 00:06:35,183
[snorting laugh]

158
00:06:37,794 --> 00:06:40,667
Lynda Carter's bush.

159
00:06:42,625 --> 00:06:44,801
Hey, you know, she's single.

160
00:06:44,888 --> 00:06:45,584
And?

161
00:06:45,672 --> 00:06:47,761
And? [laughs]

162
00:06:47,848 --> 00:06:49,632
Set me up with her.

163
00:06:49,719 --> 00:06:52,940
Can't I just... get
you a new poster?

164
00:06:54,376 --> 00:06:56,291
I'll laminate it.

165
00:06:56,378 --> 00:06:58,510
Come on, come on.

166
00:06:58,597 --> 00:07:00,077
I-I-I have been in love with
Lynda Carter for my whole life,

167
00:07:00,164 --> 00:07:03,777
and because you know her
and I know you,

168
00:07:03,864 --> 00:07:05,474
I actually have a shot.

169
00:07:05,561 --> 00:07:06,823
I mean, this is fate.

170
00:07:06,910 --> 00:07:08,738
This is probably
why my brother died.

171
00:07:08,825 --> 00:07:11,001
You said fate
killed your brother

172
00:07:11,088 --> 00:07:13,134
so you could get
that espresso machine.

173
00:07:13,221 --> 00:07:14,091
Come on!

174
00:07:14,178 --> 00:07:16,572
I'll see what I can do.

175
00:07:16,659 --> 00:07:17,791
Really?

176
00:07:17,878 --> 00:07:19,357
Yeah. Just don't
get your hopes up.

177
00:07:19,444 --> 00:07:20,881
[scoffs]:

Why not? Because, it's Lynda Carter.

257
00:10:33,421 --> 00:10:36,076
Right.

00:10:37,425 --> 00:10:40,428
Lynda Carter is an actress.

Oh. And she makes you
say her whole name?

261

She doesn't make you,

00:10:50,003 --> 00:10:51,265
She's out of his league.

265
00:10:51,352 --> 00:10:52,831
What league is she in?

266
00:10:52,919 --> 00:10:55,965
Well, among others,
the Justice League.

00:10:56,052 --> 00:10:58,533
All right, I have no idea
what you're talking about,

268
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:00,796
so let me just
ask you a question.

269
00:11:00,883 --> 00:11:03,233
Is Alan good enough
to be your friend? Of course.

270
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:06,367
So then why isn't he
good enough for her? Okay, that's not fair.

271
00:11:06,454 --> 00:11:09,152
There are a lot of women that
Alan is not good enough for.

272
00:11:09,239 --> 00:11:13,678
Don't you think she should
decide who she can go out with?

273
00:11:13,765 --> 00:11:16,551
Hmm. That's actually
a good point.

274
00:11:16,638 --> 00:11:18,292
Hang on, one second,
is this Lynda Carter? Uh-huh.

275
00:11:18,379 --> 00:11:21,425

good enough for her.

Are you decent?

280
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:34,612
Not by your standards.

281
00:11:34,699 --> 00:11:36,266
Okay, I'm coming in.

282
00:11:36,353 --> 00:11:39,052
What do you want?

283
00:11:39,139 --> 00:11:41,837
If it's self-esteem you're
after, there's none here.

284
00:11:41,924 --> 00:11:43,926
I was wrong.

285
00:11:44,013 --> 00:11:47,364

who you can or cannot date.

No, no, it's fine.

287
00:11:48,670 --> 00:11:50,019
Uh, actually, I'm making a list

288
00:11:50,106 --> 00:11:51,412
of the people
you shouldn't date.

289
00:11:51,499 --> 00:11:54,893
Uh, Number one:
Anyone with a heart.

290
00:11:54,981 --> 00:11:56,939
Okay, you know, I deserve that.

291
00:11:57,026 --> 00:11:59,246
And number two,
Taylor Swift, because she will

292
00:11:59,333 --> 00:12:03,076
write a song about you called
"Back-Stabbing Dream Killer."

293
00:12:03,163 --> 00:12:04,991
Okay, well, if you will let me,

If you're joking,
I swear to God

298
00:12:17,699 --> 00:12:20,528
I will pack my things and you
will never see me again.

299

I was joking.So was I.

300
00:12:22,312 --> 00:12:24,793
You're not just doing this
out of pity, are you?

301
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:26,751
Don't answer, I don't care.

302
00:12:26,838 --> 00:12:27,796
You're a good friend.

303
00:12:27,883 --> 00:12:29,580
So are you.

304
00:12:29,667 --> 00:12:31,974
And, again, I'm sorry.

305
00:12:32,061 --> 00:12:33,541
Thank you.

306
00:12:33,628 --> 00:12:37,153
Okay. Oh, and,
and, a little tip:

307
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:40,852
when Lynda's here, just try
not to act like a crazy fan.

308
00:12:40,939 --> 00:12:43,333
[chuckles] I got it.No, no, seriously, like, if,
if you want a shot with her

309
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:46,380
you need to treat
her like she's
a normal person.

310
00:12:46,467 --> 00:12:49,122
And, and you should
pretend to be one, yourself.

311
00:12:49,209 --> 00:12:50,688
It's not a problem.

A... gadabout.

WALDEN:
A... g-gadabout?

354
00:14:44,237 --> 00:14:46,021
What have you.

355
00:14:46,108 --> 00:14:48,763
Yeah, but that was
in your past, right?

356
00:14:48,850 --> 00:14:51,853
And now you're just a
normal, regular guy?

357
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:53,115
Yeah, that's right,
that's right.

358
00:14:53,202 --> 00:14:56,249
I'm just a,
a normal, regular guy

359
00:14:56,336 --> 00:14:59,948
looking for a crazy
little thing called love.

360

LYNDA CARTER:
♪ Crazy little thing
called love... ♪

361
00:15:02,559 --> 00:15:06,433
What's that I hear?

362
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:10,698
Is that the lovely voice of
triple-threat Lynda Carter?

363
00:15:10,785 --> 00:15:14,180
Actress, singer, dancer?

364
00:15:14,267 --> 00:15:16,965
Wait a second,
do I smell mint?

365
00:15:20,273 --> 00:15:23,537
Yes, and it's not
coming from my mouth.

366
00:15:29,238 --> 00:15:30,805
Oh, uh, uh,
would you mind signing it

367
00:15:30,892 --> 00:15:33,764
"From a Wonder Woman
to a Super Man"?

368
00:15:36,332 --> 00:15:38,987
How about "best wishes"? That works. [chuckles]

369
00:15:39,074 --> 00:15:40,510
Hey, you know,
I'll, I'll bet you could

370
00:15:40,597 --> 00:15:42,077
make a lot of money
traveling around

371
00:15:42,164 --> 00:15:43,209
and signing
at conventions and stuff.

372
00:15:43,296 --> 00:15:44,819
I'm not a big fan of travel.

373
00:15:44,906 --> 00:15:47,778
Yeah, not to mention
the weirdos you'd meet.

374
00:15:47,865 --> 00:15:50,085
Ugh. You don't
have to tell me,

375
00:15:50,172 --> 00:15:52,261
I mean, I-I've talked
to a lot of them

376
00:15:52,348 --> 00:15:55,786
on the Wonder Woman
message boards. Freaks!

377
00:15:57,266 --> 00:15:58,920
Alan? Hmm?

378
00:15:59,007 --> 00:16:00,704
I'm pretty sure Lynda didn't
come here just to sign things.

379
00:16:00,791 --> 00:16:02,750
Oh, of course, of course.
Sorry, I just, you know,

380
00:16:02,837 --> 00:16:05,013
I, I geeked out a bit.
[chuckles]

381
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:07,015
Oh, that's okay.
You can't imagine how often

382
00:16:07,102 --> 00:16:09,713
I get roped into these kinds
of conversations.

383
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:11,585
Roped? Or...

384
00:16:11,672 --> 00:16:14,501
lassoed?

385
00:16:14,588 --> 00:16:17,808
Oh, God. He's gonna tie her up
and throw her in a van.

386
00:16:17,895 --> 00:16:21,334
No, no. This is an original
Wonder Woman Lasso of Truth.

387
00:16:21,421 --> 00:16:23,597
I-I got it at Comic Con '88.

388
00:16:23,684 --> 00:16:25,947
Yeah, back when only
the really cool people went.

389
00:16:28,210 --> 00:16:30,473
Whoever is wearing the lasso
must tell the truth.

390
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,519
[giggles] Is this
the best night of my life?

391
00:16:32,606 --> 00:16:34,869
It is.

392
00:16:36,566 --> 00:16:38,786
Are you completely oblivious
to social cues?

393
00:16:38,873 --> 00:16:40,483
You are.

394
00:16:40,570 --> 00:16:43,094
Oh, oh, would you mind
posing with it

395
00:16:43,181 --> 00:16:43,617
so I can snap a quick picture?

396
00:16:45,662 --> 00:16:47,098
Alan. [whispers]: Enough.Mm-hmm?

397
00:16:47,185 --> 00:16:51,320
No. It, it's okay.
Let's just take the picture.

00:16:51,407 --> 00:16:54,192
Oh great, great. Oh,
crud. The memory's full.

399

Uh, uh, let me just
delete a few.

Good-bye, Jake.
Good-bye, Jake.

Good-bye, Jake.

403

Okay, would you like to... Yes!

404
00:17:08,294 --> 00:17:09,556
Hurry back.

405
00:17:09,643 --> 00:17:11,558
It's going well, isn't it?

406
00:17:11,645 --> 00:17:12,820
I have chimps smarter than you.

407
00:17:14,648 --> 00:17:17,825
I'm really sorry
about tonight.

408
00:17:17,912 --> 00:17:19,827
Oh, it's okay.
He's harmless.

409
00:17:19,914 --> 00:17:22,133
He isharmless, right?

410
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:25,398
Yeah, he's harmless,
clueless, homeless.

411
00:17:25,485 --> 00:17:26,703
He's pretty much "less."

412
00:17:26,790 --> 00:17:28,749
[laughs] Still,
I'm glad I came over.

413

It's really good
to see you again.

Yeah, it's good
to see you, too.
And you look amazing.

415

Or, should I say,
"wonder-ful."

416

See? When you do it,
it's cute. [chuckles]

Oh, I can be way sweeter.

Or less, if that's
what you're into.

427

Hmm.

428

wearing cuffs?

See? I told you the
gays really like me.

432
00:18:16,536 --> 00:18:19,713
I'm sorry. I, I,
I actually, I do have to ask:

a shot with you?
