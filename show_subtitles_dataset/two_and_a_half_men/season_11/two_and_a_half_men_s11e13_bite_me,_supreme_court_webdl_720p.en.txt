1
00:00:03,381 --> 00:00:05,579
So, Marty, uh,
what are we celebrating?

2
00:00:05,699 --> 00:00:10,201
My prostate exam.
Doctor gave me a thumbs up.

3
00:00:11,038 --> 00:00:13,483
At least it felt like a thumb.

4
00:00:13,603 --> 00:00:15,610
Well, I'm glad to hear
you're in good health.

5
00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:20,076
Yes, he said I could live another ten years
if I give up alcohol.

6
00:00:20,196 --> 00:00:21,726
Yeah, but you're
drinking Scotch.

7
00:00:21,846 --> 00:00:25,424
He had a finger up my keister.
What, am I gonna argue?

8
00:00:26,397 --> 00:00:29,283
It's true; he never complains
when I put my...

9
00:00:29,815 --> 00:00:33,101
What is that, the horrifying
conversation alarm?

10
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:36,984
I was hoping it was a truck
about to back over me.

11
00:00:37,104 --> 00:00:38,875
It's time for my pills.

12
00:00:38,577 --> 00:00:40,577
Evy, I think I left them
in the car.

13
00:00:40,579 --> 00:00:42,162
Would you get them?
Of course, dear.

14
00:00:41,889 --> 00:00:46,158
I think the keys are in my pocket.
You may have to root around for them.

15
00:00:46,278 --> 00:00:48,155
Really nice try.

16
00:00:48,275 --> 00:00:50,571
I-I got to remember that.
That's a good one.

17
00:00:51,137 --> 00:00:54,799
You actually have
to own something to have keys.

18
00:00:54,919 --> 00:00:57,939
Okay, let me tell you
why I'm really here.

19
00:00:58,416 --> 00:01:01,474
You know I have been dating
your mother for some time now.

20
00:01:01,594 --> 00:01:04,336
Uh, actually, she's not my mom.
Yeah, or mine.

21
00:01:04,876 --> 00:01:09,326
Well, you boys are a couple and she's
your daughter, so we're like family.

22
00:01:11,042 --> 00:01:13,232
No, we're-we're not married.

23
00:01:13,352 --> 00:01:14,929
Oh, but someday.

24
00:01:15,049 --> 00:01:18,049
No, no, we-we don't want
to get married.

25
00:01:18,169 --> 00:01:21,029
So why did you guys fight
so hard for it?

26
00:01:21,310 --> 00:01:23,140
Yeah, come on, Walden.

27
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:26,135
You're here, you're queer,
get used to it.

28
00:01:26,255 --> 00:01:27,928
As I was saying,

29
00:01:28,048 --> 00:01:32,253
your mother is a beautiful,
warm, compassionate woman.

30
00:01:32,373 --> 00:01:34,537
Everyone's entitled
to their opinion.

31
00:01:35,019 --> 00:01:37,788
I would like to ask
for her hand in marriage.

32
00:01:37,908 --> 00:01:39,438
Aw. Wow.
What?

33
00:01:39,558 --> 00:01:41,213
So, what do you say?

34
00:01:41,333 --> 00:01:44,123
Can I make an honest woman
out of your mother?

35
00:01:44,243 --> 00:01:46,234
I doubt it.

36
00:01:47,731 --> 00:01:49,773
But you have my blessing.

37
00:01:49,893 --> 00:01:51,360
Mine, too.
Congratulations.

38
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:54,598
Uh, wait, not-not so fast.
I have a question first.

39
00:01:54,718 --> 00:02:00,737
Would you allow her son to come and live with you if his
current living quarters were to, say, suddenly become a sauna?

40
00:02:01,787 --> 00:02:06,481
Any son of Evelyn's
always has a place in my home.

41
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:09,628
Welcome to the family, Dad.

42
00:02:10,677 --> 00:02:12,246
Here are your pills, dear.

43
00:02:12,366 --> 00:02:15,873
Look at that, a hot chick
carrying a bag of drugs.

44
00:02:15,993 --> 00:02:19,386
It's like 1970 all over again.

45
00:02:20,410 --> 00:02:22,522
Let's start
with the muscle relaxers.

46
00:02:22,642 --> 00:02:24,969
One for you, two for me.

47
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:34,545
I-I have to take these or...

48
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:40,227
Marty, are you okay?
Quick, quick. P-Press the medic alert.

49
00:02:41,614 --> 00:02:43,554
What is this?

50
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:45,506
This is a ring.

51
00:02:46,754 --> 00:02:50,435
I've fallen for you,
and I can't get up.

52
00:02:50,555 --> 00:02:52,033
What are you saying?

53
00:02:52,153 --> 00:02:53,455
Will you marry me?

54
00:02:53,575 --> 00:02:57,789
I can't believe this.
You are so romantic.

55
00:02:57,909 --> 00:03:00,501
Will I have to sign a prenup?
Of course not.

56
00:03:00,621 --> 00:03:02,362
Then yes,

57
00:03:02,482 --> 00:03:05,084
And I want your son
to be my best man.

58
00:03:05,204 --> 00:03:06,695
Oh, my God, really?

59
00:03:06,815 --> 00:03:09,369
Not you; pretty boy over there.

60
00:03:15,974 --> 00:03:20,624
Okay, but at the ceremony, I'm not gonna
root around in your pocket for the ring.

61
00:03:20,744 --> 00:03:23,252
And, Jennifer,
you'll be my maid of honor?

62
00:03:23,372 --> 00:03:25,468
Of course.
It's like I'm not even here.

63
00:03:25,768 --> 00:03:28,059
Sweet.
I love straight weddings.

64
00:03:28,179 --> 00:03:31,430
A bunch of drunk bridesmaids crying
because they don't have a man.

65
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:33,682
It's like eating fish
in a barrel.

66
00:03:34,199 --> 00:03:36,451
So, where are we gonna have
the ceremony?

67
00:03:36,571 --> 00:03:39,096
Why don't we just have
it here at our place?

68
00:03:39,216 --> 00:03:43,236
Uh, maybe we should discuss this
before we offer up our place.

69
00:03:43,356 --> 00:03:48,202
Do what I do; just go along with it, and
later, take it out on him in the bedroom.

70
00:04:00,214 --> 00:04:02,576
Oh, Berta, uh,
can I try something out on you?

71
00:04:02,696 --> 00:04:04,980
There isn't enough
alcohol in the world.

72
00:04:05,563 --> 00:04:08,793
No, I'm writing a toast for my mother's
wedding. Uh, so far I've got, uh,

73
00:04:08,913 --> 00:04:12,340
Ladies and gentlemen, I am so pleased
to welcome Marty Pepper to our family.

74
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:16,188
Uh, to know Marty is to love him.
He's a kind, sweet and generous man,

75
00:04:16,308 --> 00:04:19,806
which proves once and for all
that opposites really do attract.

76
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:23,297
So, you're telling everyone
you're a son of a bitch.

77
00:04:23,719 --> 00:04:25,242
I like it.

78
00:04:26,551 --> 00:04:30,230
Hey, Alan, I need your help planning
this geriatric bachelor party.

79
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:33,902
I started reaching out to the guys on
Marty's invite list, and so far I got dead,

80
00:04:34,022 --> 00:04:36,881
dead, coma, Florida.

81
00:04:37,606 --> 00:04:40,062
Hey, uh, where you thinking
about having this thing anyway?

82
00:04:40,182 --> 00:04:43,914
Well, at this point, either Boca
or the Hollywood Forever Cemetery.

83
00:04:44,222 --> 00:04:47,882
How about a strip club? I know a place
with a great all-you-can-eat buffet.

84
00:04:48,002 --> 00:04:52,059
Two things you never want to hear together.
- "Strip club" and "all-you-can-eat"

85
00:04:52,179 --> 00:04:53,798
Besides, Marty doesn't
want strippers.

86
00:04:53,918 --> 00:04:55,793
You can't have a bachelor party
without strippers.

87
00:04:55,913 --> 00:05:00,250
But more importantly, we can't let the last
naked woman this man sees be my mother.

88
00:05:01,494 --> 00:05:06,074
My granddaughters do a great two-for-one
show. I can get you a family discount.

89
00:05:06,946 --> 00:05:11,342
No, no. We... No strippers.
We're just doing a nice steak dinner.

90
00:05:11,462 --> 00:05:13,898
Well, if there's not gonna be any
strippers, then I'm not going.

91
00:05:14,018 --> 00:05:16,013
you're not on the list.

92
00:05:17,649 --> 00:05:19,988
Okay, okay,
one more time.

93
00:05:20,108 --> 00:05:23,063
I want a nice filet,
medium-rare,

94
00:05:23,183 --> 00:05:28,433
and then you give it a nice sear, and
then you put it in the food processor,

95
00:05:28,553 --> 00:05:33,645
and you give it a pump three times on chop—boom,
boom, boom— and two times on dice— boom, boom.

96
00:05:34,509 --> 00:05:35,568
Thank you.

97
00:05:38,435 --> 00:05:42,111
Oh, uh, is, uh, this the party
or the bathroom?

98
00:05:42,758 --> 00:05:44,820
Here. Over here, Tim.
Oh. Yeah.

99
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:46,011
Thank you.

100
00:05:46,131 --> 00:05:49,366
What's with the glasses?
You look like Bono.

101
00:05:49,486 --> 00:05:51,963
I was fortunate enough
to work with Bono.

102
00:05:52,083 --> 00:05:54,520
Yeah, and, uh, at the time,
he was married to Cher.

103
00:05:55,777 --> 00:06:00,859
I just got back from the eye doctor.
Boy, he robbed me blind.

104
00:06:00,979 --> 00:06:04,747
can only read the top
line of the eye chart.

105
00:06:04,867 --> 00:06:06,515
It says P.

106
00:06:06,635 --> 00:06:08,750
Then I have to.

107
00:06:09,271 --> 00:06:11,790
I-I'd like to, uh,
to propose a toast.

108
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:15,478
Uh, first to Walden for putting all
this together at the last minute.

109
00:06:15,598 --> 00:06:19,870
Well, it was tough, but I managed to
get a table at 3:00 p.m. on a Thursday.

110
00:06:20,431 --> 00:06:23,684
To Walden and his wife Alan.

111
00:06:25,678 --> 00:06:27,812
That is one ugly woman.

112
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:33,584
my mother and I have
had our ups and downs,

113
00:06:33,704 --> 00:06:36,861
but I love her,
and I want her to be happy.

114
00:06:36,981 --> 00:06:41,999
And you, Marty Pepper, make her happy,
which means I love you.

115
00:06:43,289 --> 00:06:45,524
I thought we said no broads.

116
00:06:46,734 --> 00:06:50,149
I had a gay friend
who was arrested for sodomy,

117
00:06:50,269 --> 00:06:53,362
and he had the charge reduced
to following too closely.

118
00:06:54,598 --> 00:06:59,259
Uh, anyway, um, I want to
wish you both the best. Cheers.

119
00:06:59,379 --> 00:07:03,296
Tim needs a drink.
No, no, no, no, uh, I'm driving.

120
00:07:04,486 --> 00:07:10,536
Marty, last time I saw you, we were in
a threesome with that cute little redhead.

121
00:07:10,656 --> 00:07:13,391
What ever happened to her?
I'm marrying her.

122
00:07:13,511 --> 00:07:16,137
Nice girl.
Hard worker.

123
00:07:18,277 --> 00:07:23,959
Well, I'd like to say on behalf of all of us,
getting married? What the hell are you doing, Marty?

124
00:07:24,079 --> 00:07:28,614
Why do you need seven wives?
You can barely get through nine holes of golf!

125
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:31,417
She's a sweet kid,

126
00:07:31,537 --> 00:07:35,712
and I need a little warmth
and comfort at the end of the day.

127
00:07:35,832 --> 00:07:39,046
Have you ever considered
a nice piece of toast?

128
00:07:41,149 --> 00:07:43,695
Uh, well,
I would like to say something.

129
00:07:44,171 --> 00:07:47,008
Uh... I might be
in the minority here,

130
00:07:47,128 --> 00:07:48,836
but I still believe in love,

131
00:07:48,956 --> 00:07:51,445
and it's inspiring to know

132
00:07:51,565 --> 00:07:54,223
that even at your age,
you can still find it.

133
00:07:54,343 --> 00:07:56,038
Now we have two broads.

134
00:07:57,540 --> 00:07:59,167
The kid is right.

135
00:07:59,287 --> 00:08:02,645
Nothing is more important
than love,

136
00:08:02,765 --> 00:08:05,811
except a good opening weekend.

137
00:08:06,368 --> 00:08:07,978
And salt.

138
00:08:08,941 --> 00:08:11,965
Damn it, I really miss salt.

139
00:08:12,563 --> 00:08:14,862
Okay, we're here because
we love this man.

140
00:08:14,982 --> 00:08:17,396
You know, not the way
you two love each other.

141
00:08:19,661 --> 00:08:21,750
But...
love, n-nonetheless.

142
00:08:23,915 --> 00:08:26,779
We're also here for the free
steak, am I right?

143
00:08:27,819 --> 00:08:28,775
Excuse me.

144
00:08:29,942 --> 00:08:31,112
Who is this kid?

145
00:08:31,232 --> 00:08:33,108
He's Evelyn's son.

146
00:08:33,228 --> 00:08:34,603
Who's Evelyn?

147
00:08:35,229 --> 00:08:37,273
The woman I'm marrying.

148
00:08:43,281 --> 00:08:45,761
Which one of you guys
is... Marty?

149
00:08:49,633 --> 00:08:51,791
I'm Sugar.
I'm Cinnamon.

150
00:08:51,911 --> 00:08:53,868
I'm rich!
I'm richer!

151
00:08:55,482 --> 00:08:58,389
Hey, I thought we said no strippers.
It's a bachelor party; loosen up.

152
00:08:58,509 --> 00:09:00,571
Hey, uh, Marty,
you up for a lap dance?

153
00:09:00,691 --> 00:09:03,113
I haven't been up
for a lap dance

154
00:09:03,233 --> 00:09:05,666
since the
Reagan Administration.

155
00:09:05,786 --> 00:09:07,261
Governor Reagan's.

156
00:09:07,381 --> 00:09:09,438
I think I wrote that joke.

157
00:09:09,983 --> 00:09:11,058
Girls, give him something to remember.
Uh, they're the green ones.

158
00:09:11,178 --> 00:09:14,536
Uh, they're the green ones.

159
00:09:18,364 --> 00:09:22,276
so whether you're in the middle of a lap
dance or CPR, you got to get out of there.

160
00:09:26,635 --> 00:09:28,956
I want to find something
Marty will like.

161
00:09:29,076 --> 00:09:32,120
I wonder if they have
edible underwear for diabetics.

162
00:09:32,729 --> 00:09:36,083
Well, they do have something called
I Can't Believe It's Not Body Butter.

163
00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:38,466
Hey, you'd look good in these.

164
00:09:38,586 --> 00:09:40,652
No, dear,
Marty would look good in them.

165
00:09:42,316 --> 00:09:43,916
Oh, you guys are kinky.

166
00:09:44,237 --> 00:09:47,990
If we got any kinkier, we'd
upset the animal rights people.

167
00:09:50,219 --> 00:09:52,848
So, how about
you, Jennifer?

168
00:09:52,968 --> 00:09:55,915
Are there wedding bells in your future?
It is legal now.

169
00:09:56,035 --> 00:09:57,616
Oh, don't remind me.

170
00:09:57,736 --> 00:10:00,921
I used to have the perfect get-
out-of-relationship-free card.

171
00:10:01,041 --> 00:10:03,473
Oh, I'd love to marry you,

172
00:10:03,593 --> 00:10:06,639
but darn all that prejudice
and intolerance.

173
00:10:06,759 --> 00:10:08,863
Bite me, Supreme Court.

174
00:10:08,983 --> 00:10:12,253
Well, you never know. I didn't expect to find
love this late in life,

175
00:10:12,373 --> 00:10:14,342
but there's just something
about Marty.

176
00:10:14,462 --> 00:10:17,751
Yeah, there's just
400 million things about Marty.

177
00:10:18,158 --> 00:10:22,333
Yes, but I would love him if he
was only worth 200 million.

178
00:10:23,084 --> 00:10:24,233
You know,

179
00:10:24,598 --> 00:10:27,442
I was really touched when you asked
me to be your maid of honor.

180
00:10:27,562 --> 00:10:29,812
Well, you're the
daughter of my only son.

181
00:10:29,932 --> 00:10:31,395
Well, what about Alan?

182
00:10:31,515 --> 00:10:33,703
Don't spoil my day, dear.

183
00:10:33,823 --> 00:10:36,807
And having you with me is like
having Charlie around.

184
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:39,347
This will be the only one of
my weddings without him.

185
00:10:39,467 --> 00:10:43,438
Well, except the first one, of course.
Oh, no, dear, he was there.

186
00:10:43,936 --> 00:10:46,410
It was the first time
we got drunk together.

187
00:10:49,595 --> 00:10:52,514
Where's Marty?
Nobody likes a stripper hog.

188
00:10:53,014 --> 00:10:56,645
Oh, speaking of hogs, I once did
a show with Miss Piggy.

189
00:10:56,765 --> 00:10:58,977
You know there's a
guy under there?

190
00:11:00,591 --> 00:11:02,181
You know, maybe we should go
check on him.

191
00:11:02,301 --> 00:11:04,067
I'm fine!

192
00:11:04,187 --> 00:11:08,460
Best present that I ever had in my
whole life. Thank you, Walden.

193
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:10,749
Actually, the strippers
were my idea.

194
00:11:10,869 --> 00:11:13,965
Oh, well, then you tell your
mother the wedding is off.

195
00:11:14,085 --> 00:11:15,302
Tell her what?

196
00:11:15,422 --> 00:11:17,489
Okay.

197
00:11:17,951 --> 00:11:20,081
Wedding pool.

198
00:11:20,201 --> 00:11:22,744
I have
Misplaces teeth

199
00:11:22,864 --> 00:11:25,090
and can't recite the vows."
Uh-huh.

200
00:11:26,704 --> 00:11:28,775
I had, uh...

201
00:11:29,626 --> 00:11:33,200
Died during the lap dance.

202
00:11:34,895 --> 00:11:38,811
I had "This man's
name is Gary.

203
00:11:38,931 --> 00:11:43,985
If found, take him to 104
North Beverly Drive.

204
00:11:44,105 --> 00:11:46,366
Do not give him Scotch"

205
00:11:47,805 --> 00:11:51,631
Well, I have... Alan will
screw this up somehow.

206
00:11:51,751 --> 00:11:52,757
I win.

207
00:11:53,447 --> 00:11:56,637
Are you serious? You can't call off
the wedding. You're not thinking clearly.

208
00:11:56,757 --> 00:12:00,103
I have never been more clear
about anything in my life,

209
00:12:00,223 --> 00:12:02,593
except casting Ralph Macchio.

210
00:12:02,713 --> 00:12:04,914
Kid was a born star.

211
00:12:05,283 --> 00:12:07,766
Well, I think the party is over.

212
00:12:07,886 --> 00:12:14,362
Can somebody please drive me to, uh,
104 North Beverly Drive?

213
00:12:15,077 --> 00:12:16,528
I gotcha.

214
00:12:16,648 --> 00:12:20,837
Listen, maybe on the way home,
we can pick up some Scotch.

215
00:12:21,359 --> 00:12:23,285
Wait, wait, not so fast!

216
00:12:23,405 --> 00:12:25,528
I got a catheter.

217
00:12:30,794 --> 00:12:33,358
I can't believe Marty
called off the wedding.

218
00:12:33,478 --> 00:12:37,579
I can't believe I left a bachelor party
at 4:45 in the afternoon.

219
00:12:37,699 --> 00:12:40,259
My mom is gonna be
very upset with us.

220
00:12:40,379 --> 00:12:41,093
Us?

221
00:12:41,213 --> 00:12:44,685
You threw the bachelor party.
You hired strippers!

222
00:12:44,805 --> 00:12:46,766
That's why I said "us."

223
00:12:46,886 --> 00:12:50,632
it ultimately doesn't matter because in
your mother's eyes, it's all your fault.

224
00:12:50,752 --> 00:12:54,686
You're right. She has never forgiven me
for her prolapsed vagina.

225
00:12:54,806 --> 00:12:57,795
And I'm never gonna forgive you
for putting that picture in my head.

226
00:12:57,915 --> 00:13:00,534
It's not my fault my ears
got caught.

227
00:13:01,130 --> 00:13:03,251
She's gonna be crushed,
and it's all because of us.

228
00:13:03,371 --> 00:13:06,106
Will you stop saying that!
It's because of you!

229
00:13:06,226 --> 00:13:10,078
First you destroyed her vagina,
and now it's her dreams.

230
00:13:10,566 --> 00:13:11,450
Really?

231
00:13:11,570 --> 00:13:14,854
I thought, as partners, we shared the
burdens of life for better or for worse.

232
00:13:14,974 --> 00:13:16,880
Or were they just empty vows?

233
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,254
We're not married!

234
00:13:19,374 --> 00:13:21,846
Oh, you don't have
to remind me of that.

235
00:13:22,170 --> 00:13:24,378
We're not gay!

236
00:13:24,498 --> 00:13:29,436
I can see why we have to tell other people that,
but we shouldn't have to tell each other!

237
00:13:32,206 --> 00:13:35,334
Oh, hey, Alan, look who's here.
Hello, boys.

238
00:13:35,454 --> 00:13:37,264
Hey, you want a drink?

239
00:13:37,384 --> 00:13:39,359
I know, stupid question.

240
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:42,050
Hey, Mommy,
did you have fun shopping?

241
00:13:42,170 --> 00:13:43,486
What's wrong?

242
00:13:43,606 --> 00:13:44,700
What-what do you mean,

243
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:48,859
You're using that same whiny voice you used
when you pooped your pants in ballet class.

244
00:13:48,979 --> 00:13:50,787
Good Lord.
I was a kid!

245
00:13:50,907 --> 00:13:52,589
You were 14.

246
00:13:53,562 --> 00:13:57,099
You finally had a bulge in your tights,
and it was on the wrong side.

247
00:13:57,219 --> 00:14:00,394
Okay, you know, I thought this
was gonna be difficult, but maybe not.

248
00:14:00,514 --> 00:14:03,102
Marty ran off
with a couple of strippers.

249
00:14:03,222 --> 00:14:04,586
Excuse me?

250
00:14:04,706 --> 00:14:07,969
Things got a little crazy
at the bachelor party.

251
00:14:08,089 --> 00:14:10,432
What happened?
Did he eat sugar?

252
00:14:10,552 --> 00:14:12,318
He may have.

253
00:14:16,322 --> 00:14:19,842
All right. Well, I guess he's having
one last little fling before the wedding.

254
00:14:20,338 --> 00:14:22,628
Um, y-yeah, about the wedding.

255
00:14:22,748 --> 00:14:26,353
There's that same
tutu-crapping voice again.

256
00:14:27,246 --> 00:14:28,925
He called it off.

257
00:14:29,362 --> 00:14:30,307
What?

258
00:14:31,256 --> 00:14:32,554
Sorry, Evelyn.

259
00:14:33,035 --> 00:14:37,815
But... the strippers have his medication,
and I think one of them has a nurse's outfit.

260
00:14:39,559 --> 00:14:43,468
You know, I-I think if you went over there and
talked to him, you might be able to change his mind.

261
00:14:43,588 --> 00:14:46,807
He may have even forgotten
he called off the wedding.

262
00:14:46,927 --> 00:14:50,353
No, if he doesn't want
to get married, that's fine.

263
00:14:51,056 --> 00:14:53,177
Are you okay? I mean,
is there anything we can do?

264
00:14:53,297 --> 00:14:54,835
I'm all right.

265
00:14:54,955 --> 00:14:57,980
You can't force someone
to love you.

266
00:14:59,737 --> 00:15:00,538
Excuse me.

267
00:15:03,278 --> 00:15:04,881
What did I miss?

268
00:15:05,563 --> 00:15:07,070
Well, the wedding's off,

269
00:15:07,190 --> 00:15:10,105
and Alan crapped his pants
in ballet class.

270
00:15:15,757 --> 00:15:19,446
If I inherit this place,
there's a guest room
with your name on it.

271
00:15:21,291 --> 00:15:23,987
Man, he bought this
with sitcom money.

272
00:15:24,607 --> 00:15:26,691
I am in the wrong business.

273
00:15:29,875 --> 00:15:30,933
May I help you?

274
00:15:31,053 --> 00:15:32,616
Uh, we're here
to see Marty.

275
00:15:32,736 --> 00:15:34,374
I'm sorry, Mr. Pepper is busy.

276
00:15:34,494 --> 00:15:39,602
Really? Uh, he doesn't have time
to visit with Ralph Macchio?

277
00:15:39,722 --> 00:15:43,451
A thousand apologies, Mr. Macchio.
Right this way.

278
00:15:44,073 --> 00:15:46,044
After you, Daniel-san.

279
00:15:52,219 --> 00:15:53,886
We're going to take a bath.

280
00:15:54,006 --> 00:15:56,594
You can start washing
each other.

281
00:15:57,495 --> 00:16:00,118
But save the dirty parts for me.

282
00:16:02,822 --> 00:16:03,916
Who's there?

283
00:16:04,036 --> 00:16:06,256
Uh, it's Alan and Walden.

284
00:16:06,376 --> 00:16:07,394
Who?

285
00:16:09,266 --> 00:16:12,044
Evelyn's gay son
and his boyfriend.

286
00:16:14,165 --> 00:16:15,792
All right, come on in.

287
00:16:17,185 --> 00:16:20,693
If you're here to change my mind,
forget it.

288
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:24,141
But I-I thought you loved
my mother. I do,

289
00:16:24,261 --> 00:16:27,051
but I'm not ready
to settle down.

290
00:16:27,790 --> 00:16:29,838
Maybe when I get a little older.

291
00:16:30,392 --> 00:16:31,511
Marty, I don't

292
00:16:31,631 --> 00:16:34,747
say this unkindly,

293
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:37,647
but if you get any older,
you'll be soil.

294
00:16:39,486 --> 00:16:42,821
Besides, you know my mother.
She'd sleep with you and the strippers.

295
00:16:42,941 --> 00:16:44,935
Oh, yeah,
she's a big whore.

296
00:16:45,656 --> 00:16:48,841
I'm not saying
she doesn't have her charms.

297
00:16:49,266 --> 00:16:50,912
So, what's the problem?

298
00:16:51,032 --> 00:16:55,179
The truth is, I'm a six-time
loser at marriage,

299
00:16:55,299 --> 00:16:57,847
and I don't want to go
for a seventh.

300
00:16:58,530 --> 00:16:59,848
I get it.

301
00:16:59,968 --> 00:17:02,170
You're-you're scared.

302
00:17:02,290 --> 00:17:04,592
But, you know,
in-in love,

303
00:17:04,712 --> 00:17:08,003
you have to take a leap
and hope for the best.

304
00:17:08,123 --> 00:17:10,171
That should be written
on a pillow—

305
00:17:10,291 --> 00:17:12,826
the pillow you can bite
when you and your buddy are...

306
00:17:12,946 --> 00:17:14,389
All right, all right.

307
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:20,744
No, all-all I'm saying is
is that marriage

308
00:17:20,864 --> 00:17:23,735
can be a beautiful thing.

309
00:17:23,855 --> 00:17:26,688
So, why aren't you two married?

310
00:17:31,992 --> 00:17:34,113
This isn't what you think it is.

311
00:17:37,504 --> 00:17:40,129
but you understand me.

312
00:17:40,474 --> 00:17:41,781
You're right.

313
00:17:41,901 --> 00:17:45,610
He's right.
I-I don't want to

314
00:17:45,730 --> 00:17:50,153
end up alone and a-afraid of
commitment like Marty.

315
00:17:52,504 --> 00:17:53,367
Alan...

316
00:17:54,650 --> 00:17:57,533
for the last
three years of my life,

317
00:17:57,653 --> 00:17:59,347
you have...

318
00:17:59,467 --> 00:18:01,101
always been there.

319
00:18:01,471 --> 00:18:02,689
Every day.

320
00:18:02,809 --> 00:18:06,040
When I wake up in the morning,
when I go to bed at night,

321
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,423
there you are.

322
00:18:09,690 --> 00:18:14,700
So, nobody is more surprised to hear
this coming out of my mouth than me.

323
00:18:15,413 --> 00:18:17,228
This is not happening.

324
00:18:18,135 --> 00:18:19,637
Alan Harper...

325
00:18:20,669 --> 00:18:22,233
will you marry me?

326
00:18:23,037 --> 00:18:26,149
Yes! Yes!
A billion times, yes!

327
00:18:27,110 --> 00:18:29,788
Let's save something
for the honeymoon.

328
00:18:29,908 --> 00:18:31,784
Ibiza, it has to be Ibiza.

329
00:18:31,904 --> 00:18:33,498
You're right.

330
00:18:33,618 --> 00:18:37,021
Excluding my heart,
kidney and liver,

331
00:18:37,141 --> 00:18:39,954
I'm not a young man anymore.

332
00:18:41,588 --> 00:18:43,236
I'm gonna call your mother.

333
00:18:43,356 --> 00:18:46,347
Marty,
come find the ducky.

334
00:18:48,085 --> 00:18:50,381
We-we should probably go
break the news to them.

335
00:18:50,501 --> 00:18:53,046
Yeah, yeah, that'd probably be
the proper thing to do.

336
00:18:54,409 --> 00:18:57,706
Just so you know, this is not
happening when we're married.

337
00:19:04,952 --> 00:19:05,946
Marty,

338
00:19:06,510 --> 00:19:09,563
I love you more than words
could ever say.

339
00:19:09,683 --> 00:19:12,587
From the moment
I took off my blindfold,

340
00:19:12,707 --> 00:19:16,434
turned around and saw you
behind me for the first time,

341
00:19:16,554 --> 00:19:20,546
I knew I'd never need
a safe word again.

342
00:19:21,107 --> 00:19:23,097
I wish I had
one of those right now.

343
00:19:23,217 --> 00:19:26,044
Which? The blindfold
or the safe word?

344
00:19:26,164 --> 00:19:27,034
Yes.

345
00:19:28,135 --> 00:19:31,551
Evelyn, I'm so happy
you're in my life.

346
00:19:31,671 --> 00:19:34,548
When I'm with you,
I feel like I'm 85 again.

347
00:19:34,668 --> 00:19:36,631
You're the perfect
girl for me.

348
00:19:36,751 --> 00:19:41,746
You make my heart skip a beat, and you
know how to use a defribrillator.

349
00:19:43,061 --> 00:19:44,664
I wrote that joke.

350
00:19:45,891 --> 00:19:48,541
Last night, I only got up
one time to pee.

351
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:53,715
I peed a second time,
but I-I didn't get up.

352
00:19:56,458 --> 00:20:00,168
Ashes to ashes,
and dust to dust...

353
00:20:00,775 --> 00:20:03,290
Oh, I'm sorry.
I skipped a page there.

354
00:20:04,247 --> 00:20:06,356
you may now kiss the bride.

355
00:20:12,884 --> 00:20:15,918
Congratulations, Evelyn,
on a beautiful ceremony.

356
00:20:16,038 --> 00:20:18,421
Yeah. Can't wait
for the next one.

357
00:20:19,924 --> 00:20:22,852
I just have to tell you,
I am a huge fan.

358
00:20:22,972 --> 00:20:23,795
Thank you very much.

359
00:20:23,915 --> 00:20:26,738
I lost my virginity
to one of your records.

360
00:20:26,858 --> 00:20:29,641
A-side and B-side,
if you know what I mean.

361
00:20:30,795 --> 00:20:33,479
Oh, I just became
a big fan of yours, baby.

362
00:20:35,564 --> 00:20:37,833
And I just want
to say one thing.

363
00:20:37,953 --> 00:20:41,654
None of this would've happened
without these two.

364
00:20:41,774 --> 00:20:44,002
And as my present to you,

365
00:20:44,122 --> 00:20:49,836
I've arranged for Tim to perform
one more wedding ceremony.

366
00:20:55,718 --> 00:20:57,213
Oh, my God.

367
00:20:57,333 --> 00:20:58,770
Oh, my God.

368
00:20:58,890 --> 00:21:00,407
Oh, my God.

369
00:21:00,690 --> 00:21:02,309
Oh, my God.
