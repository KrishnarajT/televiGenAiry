1
00:00:06,267 --> 00:00:07,224
Morning.

2
00:00:07,311 --> 00:00:08,138
Morning.

3
00:00:08,225 --> 00:00:10,706
Ooh, Cap'n Crunch.

4
00:00:10,793 --> 00:00:13,404
That's the only man
I put in my mouth.

5
00:00:13,491 --> 00:00:15,711
It puts my relationship
with Orville Redenbacher

6
00:00:15,798 --> 00:00:18,322
in a whole different light.

7
00:00:20,368 --> 00:00:22,674
I'm partial to the U.P.S. guy.

8
00:00:22,761 --> 00:00:25,503
We're making food jokes here.

9
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:27,505
The U.P.S. guy's not food.

10
00:00:27,592 --> 00:00:28,767
He is if you cover him
with whipped cream.

11
00:00:30,857 --> 00:00:32,946
What can I say?

12
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:36,340
There's just something
about a man in brown shorts.

13
00:00:36,427 --> 00:00:37,733
Okay, I'm in big trouble.

14
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:40,605
Speaking of a man
with brown shorts.

15
00:00:40,692 --> 00:00:41,868
What's wrong?

16
00:00:41,955 --> 00:00:43,043
Well, I just got a call

17
00:00:43,130 --> 00:00:44,087
from Lyndsey's boyfriend Larry.

18
00:00:44,174 --> 00:00:45,697
And he wants to see me.

19
00:00:45,784 --> 00:00:47,351
Well, he wants
to see Jeff Strongman.

20
00:00:47,438 --> 00:00:49,092
Who's Jeff Strongman?

21
00:00:49,179 --> 00:00:50,789
Oh, Jeff Strongman

22
00:00:50,877 --> 00:00:52,966
is Alan's alter ego he uses

23
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:56,621
to meet Larry and fight crime.

24
00:00:56,708 --> 00:01:00,495
Wait, so, you use a fake name
to sneak around with other men?

25
00:01:02,584 --> 00:01:05,108
Where do you guys meet?
A Lady Gaga concert?

26
00:01:05,195 --> 00:01:07,850
It was a spin class
if you must know.

27
00:01:07,937 --> 00:01:10,244
Now, what am I gonna do?

28
00:01:10,331 --> 00:01:12,376
I told you something
like this was gonna happen.

29
00:01:12,463 --> 00:01:14,770
[mocking]:
"I told you something like this
was gonna happen."

30
00:01:14,857 --> 00:01:17,642
Look, I am serious... he wouldn't
tell me why he wanted to see me

31
00:01:17,729 --> 00:01:18,992
and he sounded pretty upset.

32
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:20,558
Well, what kind of world
are we living in

33
00:01:20,645 --> 00:01:21,777
where a guy is upset
with another guy

34
00:01:21,864 --> 00:01:23,997
for banging his girlfriend?

35
00:01:25,955 --> 00:01:27,522
See, that's why
I love being gay.

36
00:01:27,609 --> 00:01:29,741
A guy finds out
I'm doing his girlfriend,

37
00:01:29,828 --> 00:01:31,439
I don't get an angry phone call.

38
00:01:31,526 --> 00:01:34,833
I get a dozen roses
and a copy of the video.

39
00:01:36,748 --> 00:01:39,186
Too bad I can't convince
Larry I'm gay.

40
00:01:39,273 --> 00:01:40,839
Come on, Zippy, you're making it
too easy for us.

41
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:50,588
Oh, hey!

42
00:01:50,675 --> 00:01:51,763
There he is.

43
00:01:51,850 --> 00:01:52,808
My main man with a winter tan.

44
00:01:52,895 --> 00:01:55,724
Jeff.

45
00:01:55,811 --> 00:01:57,334
Uh, I got you a coffee.
Can I get you anything else?

46
00:01:57,421 --> 00:01:59,467
Uh, one-one of these muffins?
They're bran.

47
00:01:59,554 --> 00:02:00,207
Keeps your trains
running on time.

48
00:02:00,294 --> 00:02:02,426
Poop-poop!

49
00:02:02,513 --> 00:02:04,080
I'm not hungry.

50
00:02:04,167 --> 00:02:06,213
All right then, I'll just
sit across from you.

51
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:08,041
Right here...

52
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:10,304
in front
of all these witnesses.

53
00:02:10,391 --> 00:02:12,001
You know my girlfriend Lyndsey?

54
00:02:12,088 --> 00:02:13,046
Is it Lyndsey?

55
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:14,569
I thought it was Linda.

56
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:16,266
Glad you cleared that up
before I saw her again...

57
00:02:16,353 --> 00:02:18,529
which I haven't,
and why would I?

58
00:02:18,616 --> 00:02:19,748
She's been cheating on me.

59
00:02:19,835 --> 00:02:21,837
[hacking]

60
00:02:21,924 --> 00:02:24,405
Mmm, sorry.

61
00:02:24,492 --> 00:02:26,494
Just a little...
[clears throat]

62
00:02:26,581 --> 00:02:28,626
Why do you think
she's cheating on you?

63
00:02:28,713 --> 00:02:30,193
I hired a private investigator
to follow her.

64
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,803
[hacking]

65
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:35,720
Uh, do you mind?

66
00:02:35,807 --> 00:02:37,592
She's been meeting him
at a house in Malibu.

67
00:02:40,247 --> 00:02:42,423
Sorry, sorry,
I'm just a little shocked.

68
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:43,902
Imagine how I feel.

69
00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:45,992
Well, I-I can't,
uh, uh, but I do know

70
00:02:46,079 --> 00:02:48,820
that in situations like this,
it's the woman who's to blame.

71
00:02:48,907 --> 00:02:51,606
She's not the only one.

72
00:02:51,693 --> 00:02:52,955
Please, I have a son!

73
00:02:53,042 --> 00:02:55,784
This is the guy.

74
00:02:57,177 --> 00:02:59,005
Wait, this is the guy?

75
00:02:59,092 --> 00:03:00,963
Yeah.

76
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:02,008
This is guy you think
banging your girlfriend?

77
00:03:02,095 --> 00:03:03,052
I know he is.

78
00:03:03,139 --> 00:03:05,185
And only him?

79
00:03:05,272 --> 00:03:06,186
Nobody else?

80
00:03:06,273 --> 00:03:07,665
Isn't this bad enough?

81
00:03:07,752 --> 00:03:10,016
Well, sure.

82
00:03:10,103 --> 00:03:13,758
But, you know, there could
also be another explanation.

83
00:03:13,845 --> 00:03:15,325
I mean, maybe she's just lost

84
00:03:15,412 --> 00:03:17,110
and she's asking
this guy for directions.

85
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:20,113
Right, "Excuse me, sir,
can you help me find my G-spot?"

86
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:22,941
It's not just this photo.

87
00:03:23,029 --> 00:03:23,942
It's the late night errands.

88
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:26,032
Hiding her phone.

89
00:03:26,119 --> 00:03:27,772
Plus, we haven't had sex
in forever!

90
00:03:27,859 --> 00:03:29,383
Wow, that's rough.

91
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:32,038
I guess this guy, whoever he is,

92
00:03:32,125 --> 00:03:35,650
satisfies her every need.

93
00:03:35,737 --> 00:03:36,825
I want to kill him.

94
00:03:36,912 --> 00:03:37,869
I hate being
lied to like this.

95
00:03:37,956 --> 00:03:40,046
I get it, you know.

96
00:03:40,133 --> 00:03:42,961
Sometimes you think you know
a person, but you don't.

97
00:03:43,049 --> 00:03:44,050
Panini for Strongman.

98
00:03:47,096 --> 00:03:49,142
Jeff, that's you.

99
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:50,186
What?

100
00:03:50,273 --> 00:03:51,057
Oh, oh, yeah, that's me.

101
00:03:53,581 --> 00:03:55,191
Jeff Strongman.

102
00:03:55,278 --> 00:03:57,889
Someone who's not banging
anyone's girlfriend.

103
00:03:57,976 --> 00:04:00,892
♪ Men, men, men, men, manly men,
men, men ♪

104
00:04:00,979 --> 00:04:03,721
♪ Ah. ♪
♪ Men. ♪
♪ Men. ♪

105
00:04:16,125 --> 00:04:19,389
Oh, no, there's a stranger
in my house.

106
00:04:19,476 --> 00:04:22,610
And it's possibly
a gay porn star from the '70s.

107
00:04:22,697 --> 00:04:25,047
It's me, Alan.

108
00:04:25,134 --> 00:04:26,483
I-I believe you're
supposed to say,

109
00:04:26,570 --> 00:04:28,877
[Italian accent]:
"It's-a me, a-Mario!"

110
00:04:31,836 --> 00:04:34,012
So, I take it things
didn't go great with Larry?

111
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:35,971
Well, he does know
that Lyndsey's cheating on him,

112
00:04:36,058 --> 00:04:38,930
but the good news is he doesn't
know that it's with me.

113
00:04:39,017 --> 00:04:40,628
So, why do you look

114
00:04:40,715 --> 00:04:42,978
like one of the Village People
in street clothes?

115
00:04:43,065 --> 00:04:45,067
Ah, well, uh, he hired
a, uh, a private detective,

116
00:04:45,154 --> 00:04:48,070
uh, to watch
the house because, uh,

117
00:04:48,157 --> 00:04:49,071
and here's where it gets
really funny,

118
00:04:49,158 --> 00:04:51,334
um, uh,

119
00:04:51,421 --> 00:04:54,816
he thinks that Lyndsey is
cheating on him with...

120
00:04:54,903 --> 00:04:55,991
No.

121
00:04:57,253 --> 00:04:59,690
No, no, no.

122
00:04:59,777 --> 00:05:00,952
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

123
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:03,041
It's crazy, right?

124
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,915
Why didn't you
tell him the truth?

125
00:05:07,002 --> 00:05:09,918
Fear, cowardice.

126
00:05:10,005 --> 00:05:11,485
Lack of a dental plan.

127
00:05:11,572 --> 00:05:14,705
Uh, besides, he-he
just lost Lyndsey,

128
00:05:14,792 --> 00:05:16,272
I didn't want him to
lose his best friend.

129
00:05:16,359 --> 00:05:17,578
Okay, well, you're gonna lose
your best friend

130
00:05:17,665 --> 00:05:18,579
if you don't fix this!

131
00:05:18,666 --> 00:05:19,971
Oh, I'm your best friend?

132
00:05:20,058 --> 00:05:22,191
Alan, I am serious.

133
00:05:22,278 --> 00:05:24,541
I do not want a private
detective watching this house.

134
00:05:24,628 --> 00:05:26,500
And I...
and I definitely don't want

135
00:05:26,587 --> 00:05:28,589
an angry boyfriend after me.

136
00:05:28,676 --> 00:05:29,764
Well, you should've
thought of that

137
00:05:29,851 --> 00:05:32,070
before you slept with Lyndsey.

138
00:05:32,158 --> 00:05:34,334
I've got some work to do.

139
00:05:34,421 --> 00:05:36,118
And I'm gonna go out
and run some errands.

140
00:05:36,205 --> 00:05:38,555
And when I get back,
this better be cleaned up.

141
00:05:38,642 --> 00:05:39,948
Oh, oh, don't worry, I'm on it.

142
00:05:40,035 --> 00:05:41,863
Oh, oh, but just in case.

143
00:05:45,214 --> 00:05:47,434
Oh, God!

144
00:05:47,521 --> 00:05:49,958
Is there any look
you can't pull off?

145
00:05:50,045 --> 00:05:52,439
[Italian accent]:
I'm-a gonna kill you.

146
00:05:56,791 --> 00:05:57,357
Hey!

147
00:05:57,444 --> 00:05:57,966
Hi-ya!

148
00:05:58,053 --> 00:06:00,098
Oh!

149
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:02,797
What the hell?

150
00:06:02,884 --> 00:06:05,060
Alan, what are you doing?

151
00:06:05,147 --> 00:06:08,672
At the moment,
looking for my left ball.

152
00:06:08,759 --> 00:06:10,413
Larry just dropped me off.

153
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:11,980
He could've seen you.

154
00:06:12,067 --> 00:06:13,199
That's why I'm here.
Larry thinks you're

155
00:06:13,286 --> 00:06:14,939
having an affair with Walden.

156
00:06:15,026 --> 00:06:16,680
What? Why would he think that?

157
00:06:16,767 --> 00:06:18,247
Well, because he he hired a P.I.

158
00:06:18,334 --> 00:06:19,944
who got a picture of the two
of you together.

159
00:06:20,031 --> 00:06:22,077
And by the way, it looked
like it was a cold day.

160
00:06:22,164 --> 00:06:24,645
You're an idiot.

161
00:06:24,732 --> 00:06:25,820
I know.

162
00:06:25,907 --> 00:06:27,387
So, what-what are we gonna do?

163
00:06:27,474 --> 00:06:30,128
Okay, look, I've done this
plenty of times before.

164
00:06:30,216 --> 00:06:32,740
The first thing you do
is deny everything.

165
00:06:32,827 --> 00:06:34,220
Right, denial. Wait.

166
00:06:34,307 --> 00:06:34,394
You've done this
plenty of times before?

167
00:06:36,004 --> 00:06:36,918
Did you ever cheat on me?

168
00:06:37,005 --> 00:06:38,920
Never.

169
00:06:39,007 --> 00:06:40,487
Okay, good.

170
00:06:40,574 --> 00:06:41,662
[phone chirps]
Oh!

171
00:06:41,749 --> 00:06:43,403
Oh, it's Larry.

172
00:06:43,490 --> 00:06:44,360
What does he want?

173
00:06:44,447 --> 00:06:45,970
Uh, well, let's see.

174
00:06:46,057 --> 00:06:47,102
Uh, "Just dropped off
the cheating whor...

175
00:06:47,189 --> 00:06:48,408
Lyndsey."

176
00:06:49,974 --> 00:06:50,714
"Want to grab a drink?"

177
00:06:50,801 --> 00:06:52,020
Okay, you go play

178
00:06:52,107 --> 00:06:53,326
the sympathetic friend,
calm him down.

179
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:54,675
I'll figure something out.

180
00:06:54,762 --> 00:06:55,589
Sounds good, uh...

181
00:06:55,676 --> 00:06:57,634
"No problem, bro."

182
00:06:57,721 --> 00:06:58,809
Uh...

183
00:06:58,896 --> 00:07:01,334
Cocktail glass emoji.

184
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:03,901
Stall him as long as you can.

185
00:07:03,988 --> 00:07:04,815
Right.

186
00:07:04,902 --> 00:07:06,208
I'm sorry I kicked you

187
00:07:06,295 --> 00:07:07,644
in the balls...
is there anything I can do?

188
00:07:07,731 --> 00:07:10,081
You could kiss it
and make it better.

189
00:07:10,168 --> 00:07:11,344
Good-bye, Alan.

190
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:13,041
Oh, come on!

191
00:07:13,128 --> 00:07:15,130
It's not like I
could do it myself.

192
00:07:17,045 --> 00:07:20,831
God knows I've tried.

193
00:07:20,918 --> 00:07:23,704
[tires screeching]

194
00:07:23,791 --> 00:07:25,923
Get in the car! Rose?

195
00:07:26,010 --> 00:07:26,968
What are you doing?

196
00:07:27,055 --> 00:07:28,361
Someone's following you.

197
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:30,450
Yeah, you!

198
00:07:30,537 --> 00:07:33,496
There's no time for this,
you're in danger.

199
00:07:33,583 --> 00:07:35,585
Yeah, from you!

200
00:07:35,672 --> 00:07:36,717
Just get in.

201
00:07:36,804 --> 00:07:38,196
Why would I get in your car?

202
00:07:38,284 --> 00:07:39,197
I mean, the last time

203
00:07:39,285 --> 00:07:40,373
I tried to trust you...

204
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,505
What? What are you looking at?

205
00:07:42,592 --> 00:07:45,160
You got a little spot
on your shirt.

206
00:07:45,247 --> 00:07:46,727
Oh.

207
00:07:46,814 --> 00:07:47,728
[screams]

208
00:07:47,815 --> 00:07:49,077
Drive! Drive! Drive!

209
00:07:49,164 --> 00:07:53,037
Drive! Drive!

210
00:07:53,124 --> 00:07:54,822
I found out more
about this guy.

211
00:07:54,909 --> 00:07:56,171
His name is
Walden Schmidt.

212
00:07:56,258 --> 00:07:58,086
More like lying sack of Schmidt.

213
00:07:58,173 --> 00:08:01,394
[chuckles]
Am I right?

214
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:04,614
Turns out he's some kind
of stupid Internet billionaire.

215
00:08:04,701 --> 00:08:05,833
Don't you hate
when guys don't work

216
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,008
for a living like you and me?

217
00:08:07,095 --> 00:08:09,663
Amen, Jeff Strongman.

218
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:11,229
Hey, come on, you know,

219
00:08:11,317 --> 00:08:12,318
this isn't the worst thing
in the world.

220
00:08:12,405 --> 00:08:13,841
You're gonna bounce back.

221
00:08:13,928 --> 00:08:15,669
I guess, I mean,
I should've seen it coming.

222
00:08:15,756 --> 00:08:17,235
I mean, she cheated
on her last boyfriend with me.

223
00:08:17,323 --> 00:08:20,848
Her-her last boyfriend?

224
00:08:20,935 --> 00:08:22,893
Yeah, I guess the guy
was a real loser.

225
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:25,156
A pathetic freeloader.

226
00:08:25,243 --> 00:08:28,072
Well, that's just conjecture.

227
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:30,423
I mean, you know, maybe
he's a-a really great guy

228
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:33,774
and she's just
a crazy lying bitch.

229
00:08:33,861 --> 00:08:35,166
I'm not gonna take it lying down

230
00:08:35,253 --> 00:08:36,646
like the pansy
she was dating before me.

231
00:08:36,733 --> 00:08:39,345
Is "pansy" your word or hers?

232
00:08:39,432 --> 00:08:41,042
Hers.

233
00:08:41,129 --> 00:08:42,043
I'm going to the head.

234
00:08:42,130 --> 00:08:43,392
You get the check

235
00:08:43,479 --> 00:08:44,828
and we'll go pay
this bastard a visit.

236
00:08:44,915 --> 00:08:46,221
Take your time.

237
00:08:46,308 --> 00:08:47,353
No rush.

238
00:08:50,921 --> 00:08:53,533
Oh, come on, Lyndsey,
pick up, pick up, pick up!

239
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:56,623
[groans]
Of course, voice mail.

240
00:08:56,710 --> 00:08:58,842
Lyndsey, things have gone
from bad to worse.

241
00:08:58,929 --> 00:09:00,191
Larry is gonna confront Walden,
and I don't know what to do.

242
00:09:00,278 --> 00:09:02,150
Call me back.

243
00:09:02,237 --> 00:09:03,586
Oh, and PS... you and I have

244
00:09:03,673 --> 00:09:05,806
a little issue
to discuss ourselves.

245
00:09:05,893 --> 00:09:08,548
Oh, and PPS...
the "P" stands for "pansy."

246
00:09:08,635 --> 00:09:10,419
Mm-hmm.

247
00:09:10,506 --> 00:09:11,377
Whew.

248
00:09:11,464 --> 00:09:13,683
Looks like we lost him.

249
00:09:13,770 --> 00:09:16,164
What the hell is going on?

250
00:09:16,251 --> 00:09:19,385
Well, I'm pretty sure
Larry hired a hit man.

251
00:09:19,472 --> 00:09:21,038
How do you know about Larry?

252
00:09:21,125 --> 00:09:22,518
Because he's stalking you.

253
00:09:22,605 --> 00:09:23,519
How do you know that?

254
00:09:23,606 --> 00:09:26,522
Because I'm stalking you.

255
00:09:26,609 --> 00:09:27,480
Okay, okay, you know,
this is ridiculous.

256
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:29,482
I'm calling the police.

257
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:31,397
And tell them what?

258
00:09:31,484 --> 00:09:33,573
We have no proof
of anything.

259
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:34,617
And besides, how helpful
were the police

260
00:09:34,704 --> 00:09:36,314
when you called them on me?

261
00:09:36,402 --> 00:09:39,056
Uh, I got them to issue
a restraining order.

262
00:09:39,143 --> 00:09:41,058
Hi.

263
00:09:42,669 --> 00:09:44,018
Okay, I...

264
00:09:44,105 --> 00:09:45,628
Uh-oh, he's back.

265
00:09:45,715 --> 00:09:48,849
I don't know how he
keeps finding us.

266
00:09:48,936 --> 00:09:50,503
I'll tell you how.

267
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:52,418
The GPS on my cell phone.

268
00:09:52,505 --> 00:09:53,767
Give me that.

269
00:09:55,812 --> 00:09:59,468
I was gonna turn it off,
but okay.

270
00:09:59,555 --> 00:10:00,600
Hang on.

271
00:10:00,687 --> 00:10:01,949
What? Why?

272
00:10:02,036 --> 00:10:04,995
Whoa, whoa, whoa! [squealing]

273
00:10:05,082 --> 00:10:06,954
Whoa!

274
00:10:07,041 --> 00:10:08,172
[sighs]

275
00:10:08,259 --> 00:10:09,478
That ought to do it.

276
00:10:09,565 --> 00:10:11,262
Okay, you know...
this is nonsense!

277
00:10:11,349 --> 00:10:13,526
[stammers]
Take me home.

278
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:16,137
Okay, homeward bound.

279
00:10:16,224 --> 00:10:17,138
And gagged.

280
00:10:17,225 --> 00:10:18,574
And tortured for days.

281
00:10:18,661 --> 00:10:21,882
Okay, well, fine,
then take me to a hotel.

282
00:10:21,969 --> 00:10:23,274
Beverly Hills Hotel okay?

283
00:10:23,361 --> 00:10:24,275
It's perfect.

284
00:10:24,362 --> 00:10:26,060
And bang, you're dead.

285
00:10:26,147 --> 00:10:28,105
You need to get
off the grid.

286
00:10:28,192 --> 00:10:29,672
Someplace they
don't expect you.

287
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:31,892
A place they can't track
your credit cards.

288
00:10:31,979 --> 00:10:34,503
Nobody is tracking
my credit cards.

289
00:10:34,590 --> 00:10:38,551
Oh, that wasn't you last night
getting a coffee colonic?

290
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:41,510
I will not apologize
for a healthy colon.

291
00:10:46,515 --> 00:10:48,474
Okay, here we go.

292
00:10:48,561 --> 00:10:51,128
This place looks perfect.

293
00:10:51,215 --> 00:10:53,217
This place is a dump.

294
00:10:53,304 --> 00:10:56,220
Exactly, and it's the last place
anyone would look for you.

295
00:10:56,307 --> 00:10:57,787
Yeah, but it's the first place

296
00:10:57,874 --> 00:11:00,094
that hepatitis
would look for me.

297
00:11:00,181 --> 00:11:01,704
Okay, this is only temporary.

298
00:11:01,791 --> 00:11:04,402
You lay low,
and I will straighten this out.

299
00:11:04,490 --> 00:11:06,579
Why in God's name
would I trust you?

300
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:08,494
Look, Walden, I know
that I've caused you

301
00:11:08,581 --> 00:11:10,321
some tiny problems
in the past, but...

302
00:11:10,408 --> 00:11:11,671
Wha...? Tiny?

303
00:11:11,758 --> 00:11:13,063
You pretended to be pregnant

304
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:14,412
to scare my girlfriend away.

305
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:18,373
You sicced rabid ferrets on me!

306
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:21,594
You tied me to my bed
and tried to violate me

307
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:24,684
with a leaf blower!

308
00:11:24,771 --> 00:11:28,296
It's so sweet you
remember everything.

309
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:30,603
But I can make up
for all of that now.

310
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:34,258
Look, when your sink is clogged,
you call a plumber.

311
00:11:34,345 --> 00:11:36,652
When your car breaks down,
you call a mechanic.

312
00:11:36,739 --> 00:11:38,741
When you have a dangerous
psychopath after you,

313
00:11:38,828 --> 00:11:40,830
you call me.

314
00:11:40,917 --> 00:11:41,744
All right, fine.

315
00:11:41,831 --> 00:11:43,790
I am gonna kill Alan.

316
00:11:43,877 --> 00:11:46,749
Oh, if you survive tonight,
you should hire Larry's guy.

317
00:11:46,836 --> 00:11:48,185
He's good.

318
00:11:48,272 --> 00:11:50,623
♪ Men. ♪

319
00:11:52,059 --> 00:11:54,452
♪ Men. ♪

320
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:56,542
Here you go.

321
00:11:59,545 --> 00:12:01,982
This is, uh, this is
the best room you got?

322
00:12:02,069 --> 00:12:04,071
It's the presidential suite.

323
00:12:04,158 --> 00:12:06,682
The president of what?

324
00:12:06,769 --> 00:12:08,684
Crap-o-slovakia?

325
00:12:08,771 --> 00:12:10,556
I could offer you
the honeymoon suite.

326
00:12:10,643 --> 00:12:13,776
You know, if you don't mind
the smell of love.

327
00:12:15,082 --> 00:12:17,301
No, no... this is, uh...

328
00:12:17,388 --> 00:12:18,607
this is fine.

329
00:12:18,694 --> 00:12:20,261
Uh...

330
00:12:20,348 --> 00:12:22,742
Do you, uh, do you
have room service?

331
00:12:25,483 --> 00:12:27,485
I might have something
you might want to eat.

332
00:12:29,575 --> 00:12:31,577
I don't think you do.

333
00:12:34,405 --> 00:12:38,105
Listen, uh, if-if anyone
comes here asking about me,

334
00:12:38,192 --> 00:12:39,715
I-I'm not here.

335
00:12:39,802 --> 00:12:40,803
Don't worry.

336
00:12:40,890 --> 00:12:42,152
No one will ever find you.

337
00:12:49,551 --> 00:12:52,336
Hey, uh, if you get
lonely later on,

338
00:12:52,423 --> 00:12:54,425
I'm in the apartment
behind the building.

339
00:12:54,512 --> 00:12:56,689
Yeah, okay.

340
00:12:56,776 --> 00:12:58,212
It's nothing fancy,
but I've got some good weed

341
00:12:58,299 --> 00:13:02,520
and... a spa tub.

342
00:13:02,608 --> 00:13:05,872
I'll, uh, keep that in mind.

343
00:13:05,959 --> 00:13:07,700
There's a live feed
on channel 14

344
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:09,136
if you want to check it out.

345
00:13:14,271 --> 00:13:15,621
[door closes]

346
00:13:15,708 --> 00:13:18,536
Great, now I got
to hide from him, too.

347
00:13:21,148 --> 00:13:25,108
This Walden guy is gonna regret
the day he stole my girlfriend.

348
00:13:25,195 --> 00:13:27,589
Oh, it's-it's not stealing.
It-It's more like borrowing.

349
00:13:27,676 --> 00:13:29,460
Like-like renting a car.

350
00:13:29,547 --> 00:13:31,027
Yeah, but when you rent a car
you know there's been

351
00:13:31,114 --> 00:13:33,639
other guys inside it,
turning the knobs,

352
00:13:33,726 --> 00:13:34,944
playing with the seat,

353
00:13:35,031 --> 00:13:36,554
shoving stuff in the trunk.

354
00:13:36,642 --> 00:13:38,861
Okay, okay, maybe that's
a bad analogy.

355
00:13:38,948 --> 00:13:40,558
But that doesn't change
the fact that going over there

356
00:13:40,646 --> 00:13:42,735
to confront him is not
gonna help anything.

357

if I don't do this,

to live with myself.

you took a restraining order

out against me...
