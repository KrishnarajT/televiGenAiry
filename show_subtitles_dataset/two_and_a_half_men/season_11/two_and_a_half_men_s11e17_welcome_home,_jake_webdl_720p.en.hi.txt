Larry, where can
I put this poop?

This is my sister Gretchen.
She just moved here.

00:00:07,070 --> 00:00:08,724
Gretchen, this is
Jeff Strongman.

about what you said

I don't want
to work for Google.

I want to stay and work

00:04:25,371 --> 00:04:26,721

a "pee in the shower"

or "not pee in the shower"
household?

120

"Not pee in the shower."

121
00:04:30,768 --> 00:04:34,511
So it's a "pee in the shower
and lie about it" household.

122
00:04:34,598 --> 00:04:38,863
And don't touch
my shower porn!

but hitting me
with a 25-cent hat

127
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:51,223
is not gonna solve anything.

128
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:52,747
He's not moving in.

more comfortable,

172
00:06:30,714 --> 00:06:32,455
we can keep it a secret for now.

173
00:06:32,542 --> 00:06:34,849
I mean, if you're good
at keeping secrets.

174
00:06:34,936 --> 00:06:36,459
I don't know.
