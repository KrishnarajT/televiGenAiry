Previously
onTwo and a Half Men...

2
00:00:06,575 --> 00:00:08,273
There is something I...

3
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:09,143
probably should've told you
before we slept together.

4
00:00:09,230 --> 00:00:10,928
Oh, God. Husband
or herpes?

5
00:00:11,015 --> 00:00:13,147
For the first 40
years of my life,

6
00:00:13,234 --> 00:00:16,194
I was a man named Paul.

7
00:00:17,586 --> 00:00:20,502
Wow.
[chuckles]

8
00:00:20,589 --> 00:00:22,896
Um...
You don't look...

Oh...

10
00:00:29,729 --> 00:00:32,732
I love Christmas
in Malibu.

11
00:00:32,819 --> 00:00:35,692
I just saw Santa Claus
smoking a joint on the beach.

12
00:00:35,779 --> 00:00:37,781
No, that's just Crazy Don.

13
00:00:37,868 --> 00:00:39,826
He's a homeless guy with a beard
who asks girls

14
00:00:39,913 --> 00:00:41,567
to sit on his lap and try
to find the North Pole.

This came for you.

16
00:00:43,787 --> 00:00:46,790
I'm pretty sure it's from Jake.

17
00:00:46,877 --> 00:00:51,185
He spelled "Malibu"
M-A-L-I-B-O-O.

18
00:00:51,272 --> 00:00:52,230
Oh. No,

19
00:00:52,317 --> 00:00:53,753
actually, it's "Maliboobs."

20
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:57,104
He put little nipples
on the O's. [laughs]

21
00:00:57,191 --> 00:00:59,890
I just can't get used to
Christmas without him.

22
00:00:59,977 --> 00:01:01,587
It's just
not the same.

23
00:01:01,674 --> 00:01:03,676
Remember how he used to
screw up Christmas carols?

He packed 'em in ice. [coughs]

he sent us those Easter eggs.

Hi. Nice to meet you.

53
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:14,791
Where did, uh,
you two meet?

54
00:02:14,878 --> 00:02:16,096
At my work.

55
00:02:16,183 --> 00:02:17,445
Oh, and, uh,
what do you do?

56
00:02:17,532 --> 00:02:18,751
I'm an esthetician.

57
00:02:18,838 --> 00:02:21,188
Ooh, an esthetician. Very impressive.

58
00:02:21,275 --> 00:02:23,234
You have no idea
what I'm talking about, do you?

59
00:02:23,321 --> 00:02:25,236
No.
Zero.

00:02:25,323 --> 00:02:26,672
How do I put this?

Do you guys like

Aw, yeah.
Yeah.

63
00:02:30,458 --> 00:02:31,982
Okay, there you go.
That's what I do.

You know, waxing, tweezing,
threading and plucking.

65
00:02:35,724 --> 00:02:37,683
She plucked the hell
out of me last night.

66
00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:42,340
Ooh, and brought a whole
new meaning to "ho, ho, ho."

67
00:02:42,731 --> 00:02:44,646
Listen, you want to go
get some breakfast?

Nah, I got to bounce.
Thanks again.

Oh, yeah.
Yeah. Big-time.

72
00:02:55,875 --> 00:02:58,095
Well, no biggie.

73
00:02:58,182 --> 00:03:01,446
I'll just go back
to plucking myself.

74
00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:04,188
I feel bad for her.

75
00:03:04,275 --> 00:03:06,494
Do you remember the first time
you were rejected by a woman?

76
00:03:06,581 --> 00:03:08,975
Yeah. When the maternity
nurse handed me to my mom.

Oh... thanks,

82
00:03:25,296 --> 00:03:26,819
but I can't.
I take hormones,

83
00:03:26,906 --> 00:03:29,300

you were married.

you had a penis, so...

Yeah. And thankfully
the same shoe size. Oh.

By the way, those silver
platforms that you lent me

113
00:04:41,676 --> 00:04:42,939
really did a number on my back.

Well, um, maybe
you'd make a house call

134
00:05:26,243 --> 00:05:27,896
if that's not too weird?

135
00:05:27,984 --> 00:05:30,247

me dating a dude.

sneaking the cider.
What?

What? Really?
Mmm. Mm-hmm.

Yeah, well, I've had
a tough morning.

talk about it?

00:05:59,015 --> 00:06:00,973
"Rap"?

145
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:05,021
You're like the creepy guidance
counselor I had in high school.

00:06:06,413 --> 00:06:08,328
"Tell me all
about your lesbian experiences.

147
00:06:08,415 --> 00:06:11,766
I can't help you
unless I know every detail."

148
00:06:11,853 --> 00:06:13,812
God, I hated her.

149
00:06:15,205 --> 00:06:16,162
She was good in bed, though.

150
00:06:16,249 --> 00:06:19,078
Really? Tell me about it.

151
00:06:19,165 --> 00:06:21,820
I can't help you unless
I know every detail.

152
00:06:23,952 --> 00:06:26,129
Oh, come on. You're
a relationship guy, right?

153
00:06:26,216 --> 00:06:27,913
I don't know. I mean,
I-I do believe

154
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,828
there is someone out
there for everyone.

155
00:06:29,915 --> 00:06:32,004
I'm just terrified that
my someone is Alan.

156
00:06:32,091 --> 00:06:34,920
So... [clears throat]
how do you know

157
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:37,923
when you want to be
in a relationship?

158
00:06:38,010 --> 00:06:39,794
The first sign is that
you start asking people,

159
00:06:39,881 --> 00:06:43,276
"How do you know when you
want to be in a relationship?"

160
00:06:43,363 --> 00:06:44,712
Oh, God.

161
00:06:44,799 --> 00:06:45,974
Sick of plucking
yourself already?

162
00:06:48,238 --> 00:06:50,501
Is it the, uh, girl
from yesterday?

163
00:06:50,588 --> 00:06:52,503
Yeah.

164
00:06:52,590 --> 00:06:54,592
Brooke.

165
00:06:54,679 --> 00:06:56,376
Why don't you just call her?

166
00:06:56,463 --> 00:06:59,466
No. No. I'm the girl
that gets called.

167
00:06:59,553 --> 00:07:01,599
I don't do the calling.

168
00:07:01,686 --> 00:07:03,862
Oh, my God, she gave you
a fake number.

169
00:07:03,949 --> 00:07:08,997
It's possible she lives in the
back of a Mexican restaurant.

170
00:07:09,085 --> 00:07:11,391
Hey, look,
if you really like this girl,

171
00:07:11,478 --> 00:07:14,002
look her up on Facebook
and send her a message.

172
00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:17,049
Oh, or... send her a picture
of your boobs.

173
00:07:17,136 --> 00:07:18,877
That's desperate.

174
00:07:18,964 --> 00:07:22,794
Besides, she already
has a picture of my boobs.

175
00:07:22,881 --> 00:07:26,841
Or the busboy in the back of
the Mexican restaurant has it.

176
00:07:26,928 --> 00:07:28,843
All right, look.

177
00:07:28,930 --> 00:07:31,019
Sometimes in life

178
00:07:31,107 --> 00:07:32,934
you have to take a risk

179
00:07:33,021 --> 00:07:34,936
and put yourself out there.

180
00:07:35,023 --> 00:07:35,937
Sometimes it doesn't work.

181
00:07:36,024 --> 00:07:39,637
But sometimes it does.

182
00:07:39,724 --> 00:07:41,508
And sometimes

183
00:07:41,595 --> 00:07:44,032
it works so well that you
end up proposing to them

184
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,773
and they say no

185
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:49,429
and all you're left with
is a custom designed ring

186
00:07:49,516 --> 00:07:53,607
that you can't return whose
very existence mocks you.

187
00:07:54,086 --> 00:07:57,481
[exhales]

188
00:07:58,525 --> 00:08:00,005
You want to rap about it?

189
00:08:00,092 --> 00:08:02,094
Shut up!

190
00:08:03,791 --> 00:08:05,706
I will have this set up
in a sec.

191
00:08:06,054 --> 00:08:09,014
[loud cracking]Oh! My back.

192
00:08:09,101 --> 00:08:10,798
Oh, my God, are you okay?

193
00:08:10,885 --> 00:08:12,278
[cracking][chuckles]

194
00:08:12,365 --> 00:08:13,192
Little chiropractor humor.

195
00:08:15,107 --> 00:08:16,717
I call it "cracking you up."

196
00:08:16,804 --> 00:08:18,980
Hop on up.

197
00:08:19,067 --> 00:08:21,505
How long have you and Paula
been dating?

198
00:08:21,592 --> 00:08:23,289
Oh, just a-a couple
of weeks.

199
00:08:23,376 --> 00:08:26,031
You know, still holding hands,
running the water while I pee.

200
00:08:26,118 --> 00:08:28,120
How long were you
and Paul together?

201
00:08:28,207 --> 00:08:29,817
20 years.

202
00:08:29,904 --> 00:08:33,212
Wow. That's pooping
while the other one showers.

203
00:08:33,299 --> 00:08:35,693
Uh, so, uh, Paul's change

204
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:36,998
must have been
a big adjustment for you.

205
00:08:37,085 --> 00:08:39,958
Oh, I was pretty
angry at first.

206
00:08:40,045 --> 00:08:42,874
When he said he wanted to become
a woman, I grabbed a knife

207
00:08:42,961 --> 00:08:45,746
from the kitchen and offered
to do the surgery myself.

208
00:08:45,833 --> 00:08:46,878
Woop!
[chuckles]

209
00:08:46,965 --> 00:08:48,749
Baggage just stowed for takeoff.

210
00:08:48,836 --> 00:08:51,187
Um, at least the two of you are
in a healthy place now.

211
00:08:51,274 --> 00:08:53,754
Oh, it's not easy.

212
00:08:53,841 --> 00:08:55,278
Can you imagine
how annoying it is

213
00:08:55,365 --> 00:08:57,410
that she's a better-looking
woman than I am?

214
00:08:57,497 --> 00:08:59,107
And the boobs, by the way,

215
00:08:59,195 --> 00:09:00,718
exact copies of mine.

216
00:09:00,805 --> 00:09:02,459
Well, I think
you're both very beautiful,

217
00:09:02,546 --> 00:09:05,679
and, uh...
and kudos on the boobs.

218
00:09:05,766 --> 00:09:07,203
Would you mind working
a little lower?

219
00:09:07,290 --> 00:09:09,292
Oh, sure. Let's, uh...

220
00:09:09,379 --> 00:09:10,728
let's narrow it down
to the lumbar region.

221
00:09:10,815 --> 00:09:13,600
Uh, where does it hurt?
Uh, L5? L4?

222
00:09:13,687 --> 00:09:15,036
Lower.

223
00:09:15,123 --> 00:09:17,213
Okay, we're into
the-the sacral region.

224
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:20,346
Uh, that's S2. S3?

225
00:09:20,433 --> 00:09:22,696
A-A little lower.

226
00:09:22,783 --> 00:09:24,176
Okay.

227
00:09:24,263 --> 00:09:26,570
Uh, I believe
we are out of the S's

228
00:09:26,657 --> 00:09:28,093
and into the asses.

229
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:30,574
How does that feel?

230
00:09:30,661 --> 00:09:33,272
Uh, like the tension
has moved out of your back

231
00:09:33,359 --> 00:09:35,361
and into my pants.

232
00:09:35,448 --> 00:09:37,320
I'm sure
this is wildly inappropriate,

233
00:09:37,407 --> 00:09:39,452
but I'm very attracted to you.

234
00:09:39,539 --> 00:09:42,063
Well, I'm-I'm flattered.
Uh-uh, it's just that...

235
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:44,152
I'm dating your ex-husband.

236
00:09:46,024 --> 00:09:48,331
Boy, that was a weird thing
to hear yourself say.

237
00:09:48,418 --> 00:09:50,289
I understand.

238
00:09:50,376 --> 00:09:53,423
Let me know if you
change your mind.

239
00:09:54,511 --> 00:09:57,296
You do realize your hand
is still on my ass.

240
00:09:57,383 --> 00:09:59,167
I do.

241
00:09:59,255 --> 00:10:00,952
Still there.

242
00:10:01,039 --> 00:10:03,868
I'm just glad you don't know
where my other hand is.

243
00:10:07,437 --> 00:10:10,309
Hi. So, I have you down for

244
00:10:10,396 --> 00:10:12,529
the total bro-zilian wax.

245
00:10:12,616 --> 00:10:14,139
Yeah, I wasn't really sure
which one to choose.

246
00:10:14,226 --> 00:10:16,141
It was either that
or the Butt Reynolds.

247
00:10:16,228 --> 00:10:18,622
Wait, don't I know you?

248
00:10:18,709 --> 00:10:20,841
Yeah, I'm Walden.

249
00:10:20,928 --> 00:10:23,496
Hang on. Did you chase me out
of your house the other day

250
00:10:23,583 --> 00:10:26,978
for banging your wife?
'Cause she came on to me.

251
00:10:27,065 --> 00:10:29,154
No, uh, you hooked up
with my friend Jenny.

252
00:10:29,241 --> 00:10:30,895
Uh, we live in Malibu.

253
00:10:30,982 --> 00:10:33,332
Oh, yeah, yeah, Jenny.
Yeah, she was a lot of fun.

254
00:10:33,419 --> 00:10:34,290
Oh-oh, God,
does she have herpes?

255
00:10:34,377 --> 00:10:36,248
Is that why you're here?

256
00:10:36,335 --> 00:10:38,990
[chuckles]
No, that is not why I'm here.

257
00:10:39,077 --> 00:10:40,165
Actually, I wanted
to see if you...

258
00:10:40,252 --> 00:10:41,253
Ow!

259
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:44,517
Oh!

260
00:10:44,604 --> 00:10:45,779
[panting]

261
00:10:45,866 --> 00:10:47,303
Okay. Oh, my God.

262
00:10:47,390 --> 00:10:48,782
How 'bout a little
heads-up next time?

263
00:10:48,869 --> 00:10:49,696
Okay, heads-up.

264
00:10:49,783 --> 00:10:53,439
Hey!
[panting]

265
00:10:53,526 --> 00:10:56,573
So, why are you here?

266
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:58,096
Uh, well... [laughs]

267
00:10:58,183 --> 00:11:00,707
Well, um, my-my
friend Jenny...

268
00:11:00,794 --> 00:11:02,535
she thinks that
you're really cool.

269
00:11:02,622 --> 00:11:04,102
And this is
kind of awkward.

270
00:11:04,189 --> 00:11:05,930
I don't really know
how to say this.

271
00:11:06,017 --> 00:11:07,453
Take her out again!

272
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:09,325
Yeah, I don't know.

273
00:11:09,412 --> 00:11:11,414
I mean, I like
to keep it casual.

274
00:11:11,501 --> 00:11:13,154
Lesbians get too attached,

275
00:11:13,241 --> 00:11:16,984
and then somebody always
ends up screaming or crying.

276
00:11:17,071 --> 00:11:18,638
[screams, crying]

277
00:11:18,725 --> 00:11:20,423
I get that.

278
00:11:20,510 --> 00:11:22,686
Um, uh, but
here's the thing.

279
00:11:22,773 --> 00:11:23,948
Like,

280
00:11:24,035 --> 00:11:25,428
Jenny's really awesome,

281
00:11:25,515 --> 00:11:27,430
and I think
if you took a chance

282
00:11:27,517 --> 00:11:29,345
to get to know her
that you would really like her.

283
00:11:29,432 --> 00:11:31,129
Yeah? I don't know.
Turn over.

284
00:11:31,216 --> 00:11:33,871
What?

285
00:11:33,958 --> 00:11:35,133
All fours, butt up.

286
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:37,178
Oh. This...

287
00:11:37,265 --> 00:11:42,967
This reminds me of a horrible
prison nightmare I once had.

288
00:11:45,578 --> 00:11:48,102
You know, I got to say,
if you're willing

289
00:11:48,189 --> 00:11:50,322
to go through all
of this for your friend,

290
00:11:50,409 --> 00:11:51,454
she must be all right, huh?

291
00:11:51,541 --> 00:11:53,760
Yeah.
I'll give her a call.

292
00:11:53,847 --> 00:11:56,023
[sighs]
Okay.

293
00:11:56,110 --> 00:11:56,763
This one's gonna hurt.

294
00:11:56,850 --> 00:11:59,113
This one?

295
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,288
[shouting]:
Mommy!

296
00:12:24,312 --> 00:12:25,966
[sighs]

297
00:12:26,053 --> 00:12:27,054
Whoa.

298
00:12:28,752 --> 00:12:31,276
Some might say
that a guy who does this

299
00:12:31,363 --> 00:12:34,192
out in the open wants
his housekeeper to catch him.

300
00:12:35,759 --> 00:12:36,412
No, I-I... [sighs]

301
00:12:39,371 --> 00:12:42,722
Oh, hey, Johnson and Johnson.

302
00:12:42,809 --> 00:12:43,984
And Johnson.

303
00:12:44,071 --> 00:12:46,073
[laughs]

304
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:50,338
Oh.

305
00:12:50,426 --> 00:12:53,516
[laughs]

306
00:12:53,603 --> 00:12:55,431
Hold on.

307
00:12:55,518 --> 00:12:56,997
Weren't you the one
that called the house meeting

308
00:12:57,084 --> 00:12:58,825
about no more masturbating
in the kitchen?

309
00:12:58,912 --> 00:13:00,348
No, I... I, uh...

310
00:13:00,436 --> 00:13:03,569
I got groomed.

311
00:13:03,656 --> 00:13:05,136
Actually,

312
00:13:05,223 --> 00:13:07,878
I went down to Brooke's salon...

313
00:13:07,965 --> 00:13:09,445
and asked her if she would
go out with you again.

314
00:13:09,532 --> 00:13:11,621
Are you insane?

315
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:14,058
What, you think
I can't get my own dates?

316
00:13:14,145 --> 00:13:15,494
Do I look like a child?

317
00:13:15,581 --> 00:13:18,715
No, but thanks to Brooke, I do.

318
00:13:20,586 --> 00:13:22,675
And thanks to me,

319
00:13:22,762 --> 00:13:25,069
she wants to go out
with you again.

320
00:13:25,156 --> 00:13:27,158
She wants to go out
with me again?

321
00:13:27,245 --> 00:13:28,159
What did she say?

322
00:13:28,246 --> 00:13:29,508
You want to rap about it?

323
00:13:31,902 --> 00:13:35,427
She said that she would call you
in a few days,

324
00:13:35,514 --> 00:13:38,430
and that my balls
would stop burning by tomorrow.

325
00:13:38,517 --> 00:13:39,866
Or wait.

326
00:13:39,953 --> 00:13:42,521
Was it that she would call you
tomorrow,

327
00:13:42,608 --> 00:13:44,523
and my balls would stop burning
in a few days?

328
00:13:44,610 --> 00:13:46,525
Let me know when she calls.

329
00:13:46,612 --> 00:13:48,614
Okay?

330
00:13:48,701 --> 00:13:50,486
Thank you. Thank you from
the bottom of my heart.

331
00:13:50,573 --> 00:13:54,577
You are welcome
from the bottom of my scrotum.

332
00:13:57,623 --> 00:13:58,755
[panting]

333
00:13:58,842 --> 00:14:00,147
Wow. That was amazing.

334
00:14:00,234 --> 00:14:01,366
[both laugh]

335
00:14:01,453 --> 00:14:02,802
I got to tell you.

336
00:14:02,889 --> 00:14:04,543
The guy who built your hoo-hah
is an artist.

337
00:14:04,630 --> 00:14:06,153
Aw.

338
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:08,068
He's like van Gogh,
but instead of cutting off ears,

339
00:14:08,155 --> 00:14:10,244
he's cutting off...
well, you know.

340
00:14:10,331 --> 00:14:11,376
[sighing]

341
00:14:11,463 --> 00:14:14,161
Hey.
What?

342
00:14:14,248 --> 00:14:15,946
Can we talk about us?

343
00:14:16,033 --> 00:14:17,382
Oh, God, can't I...
can't I just buy you something?

344
00:14:17,469 --> 00:14:19,558
Well, gifts are
always welcome,

345
00:14:19,645 --> 00:14:24,824
but, uh, I was just wondering
if we were exclusive.

346
00:14:24,911 --> 00:14:26,739
Okay, look, Alan...

347
00:14:26,826 --> 00:14:28,524
[panting]

348
00:14:28,611 --> 00:14:30,395
I like you, but I always...
I always promised myself

349
00:14:30,482 --> 00:14:34,268
that if I had the courage
to become a real woman,

350
00:14:34,355 --> 00:14:36,270
that that woman...

351
00:14:36,357 --> 00:14:38,316
would be a total slut.

352
00:14:38,403 --> 00:14:40,666
Okay, so-so...
so, just to clarify...

353
00:14:40,753 --> 00:14:41,754
Mm-hmm.

354
00:14:41,841 --> 00:14:44,583
you... or me are free

355
00:14:44,670 --> 00:14:46,977
to date anybody else,
anybody in the world?

356
00:14:47,064 --> 00:14:48,369
Yes.

357
00:14:48,456 --> 00:14:50,067
Okay, if that's what you want.

358
00:14:50,154 --> 00:14:52,156
[laughs]

359
00:14:59,990 --> 00:15:01,426
Oh, hey, you look great.

360
00:15:01,513 --> 00:15:03,689
No, I don't.

361
00:15:03,776 --> 00:15:05,648
I've tried on, like,
a hundred outfits.

362
00:15:05,735 --> 00:15:07,824
Butch, femme, lipstick, pixie.

363
00:15:07,911 --> 00:15:09,652
There was even a dark moment

364
00:15:09,739 --> 00:15:12,132
where I was wearing
one of Alan's polos.

365
00:15:12,219 --> 00:15:14,134
Oh, actually,
they're called "polas."

366
00:15:14,221 --> 00:15:16,833
He buys them at a gas station.

367
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:19,009
If you look close,
the guy's not playing polo.

368
00:15:19,096 --> 00:15:20,837
It's a gardener riding a donkey.

369
00:15:20,924 --> 00:15:23,579
I'm a nervous wreck.

370
00:15:23,666 --> 00:15:25,581
Oh, come on.
You're going to be fine.

371
00:15:25,668 --> 00:15:26,712
Just be yourself.
Right.

372
00:15:26,799 --> 00:15:31,108
Right. Right,
just be myself.

373
00:15:31,195 --> 00:15:33,414
W.W.J.D.?

374
00:15:33,501 --> 00:15:36,853
What would Jenny drink?

375
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:38,637
I don't think
that alcohol is the answer.

376
00:15:38,724 --> 00:15:42,075
Well, clearly,
you don't know the question.

377
00:15:43,599 --> 00:15:46,993
On vodka, on soda,

378
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:49,822
on blender, on mixer!

379
00:15:49,909 --> 00:15:52,564
Okay, I'm just gonna go back
to blowing myself.

380
00:15:57,700 --> 00:16:00,354
So, uh, did you ask Santa
for anything special this year?

381
00:16:00,441 --> 00:16:03,270
Oh, just someone
to stuff my stocking.

382
00:16:03,357 --> 00:16:05,229
Oh. Someone's on
the naughty list.

383
00:16:05,316 --> 00:16:09,450
Well, I hope that won't keep me
from getting a nice big package.

384
00:16:09,537 --> 00:16:11,452
Oh, don't you worry.

385
00:16:11,539 --> 00:16:14,499
I'm sure Santa's got something
in his sack for you.

386
00:16:14,586 --> 00:16:16,762
Ooh, look
who's on the naughty list now.

387
00:16:16,849 --> 00:16:17,850
[laughs]

388
00:16:17,937 --> 00:16:19,417
But you have to be careful

389
00:16:19,504 --> 00:16:21,158
about shipping rates
around the holidays.

390
00:16:21,245 --> 00:16:23,421
You could pay extra
for a package that's oversized

391
00:16:23,508 --> 00:16:24,944
or an irregular shape.

392
00:16:27,817 --> 00:16:28,948
Rachel?

393
00:16:29,035 --> 00:16:30,950
Paula?

394
00:16:31,037 --> 00:16:33,953
Alan? What's going on here?

395
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:36,260
Uh, well, this is a...
an awkward coincidence.

396
00:16:36,347 --> 00:16:37,914
It's not a coincidence.
I come here every Friday night,

397
00:16:38,001 --> 00:16:39,872
and she knows it. Oh, this is completely innocent.

398
00:16:39,959 --> 00:16:43,267
Oh, please. You're wearing
my screw-me pumps!

399
00:16:43,354 --> 00:16:44,877
That's funny.
Uh, I have a screw-me pump, too.

400
00:16:44,964 --> 00:16:48,054
I only need it
when I'm drinking too much.

401
00:16:50,448 --> 00:16:52,755
All the women in the world,
and you have to pick my ex-wife?

402
00:16:52,842 --> 00:16:55,235
Uh, first of all,
I don't actually get to pick.

403
00:16:55,322 --> 00:16:57,673
I'm more of a
take-what-comes kind of guy.

404
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:59,762
Besides, you said
we weren't exclusive.

405
00:16:59,849 --> 00:17:01,764
Oh.
Yeah, he can date
whoever he wants.

406
00:17:01,851 --> 00:17:03,243
Okay, you only brought him here
to make me jealous.

407
00:17:03,330 --> 00:17:05,071
Oh, please. Don't
flatter yourself.

408
00:17:05,158 --> 00:17:07,465
Okay, let's all...
let's just calm down here.

409
00:17:07,552 --> 00:17:09,336
Hey, I see it now.

410
00:17:09,423 --> 00:17:10,947
You guys do have the same boobs.

411
00:17:15,516 --> 00:17:17,431
Jenny?

412
00:17:17,518 --> 00:17:19,433
Are you okay?

413
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,522
I'll be right there.

414
00:17:23,655 --> 00:17:26,179
Can you knock again
so I can find the door?

415
00:17:26,266 --> 00:17:27,790
Okay, I'm coming in.

416
00:17:27,877 --> 00:17:29,313
Hey.

417
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:30,662
Hey, Walden!

418
00:17:30,749 --> 00:17:31,663
Are you drunk?

419
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:35,058
No, I only had one drink.

420
00:17:35,145 --> 00:17:37,321
Okay, I went to a lot
of trouble for you,

421
00:17:37,408 --> 00:17:39,802
and you are going
on this date.

422
00:17:39,889 --> 00:17:41,760
Why do you care so much?

423
00:17:41,847 --> 00:17:43,849
Well, I can give you
a bro-zilian reasons why.

424
00:17:43,936 --> 00:17:45,677
Now, come on.

425
00:17:45,764 --> 00:17:47,853
Let's get you
sobered up. Okay, let me just use

426
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:49,376
the bathroom
real quick.

427
00:17:49,463 --> 00:17:51,988
Jenny?

428
00:17:52,075 --> 00:17:52,945
That's not the bathroom.

429
00:17:53,032 --> 00:17:55,121
Too late.

430
00:17:57,254 --> 00:17:58,908
How could you do this to me?

431
00:17:58,995 --> 00:18:01,824
It hurts losing the man of
your dreams, doesn't it?

432
00:18:01,911 --> 00:18:03,782
Please. Alan is not
the man of my dreams.

433
00:18:03,869 --> 00:18:05,349
He's just the only guy
who didn't think

434
00:18:05,436 --> 00:18:07,394
an inside-out wiener
was a deal breaker.

435
00:18:07,481 --> 00:18:11,790
I've also been told
I have nice eyes, but okay.

436
00:18:11,877 --> 00:18:14,924
Well, you werethe
man of my dreams.

437
00:18:15,011 --> 00:18:15,968
Don't you see
what's going on here?

438
00:18:16,055 --> 00:18:18,797
You still care for her,

439
00:18:18,884 --> 00:18:20,886
and you're just trying
to make her jealous

440
00:18:20,973 --> 00:18:22,192
by dating a sexy, handsome,
well-endowed man.

441
00:18:24,498 --> 00:18:26,370
I do still have feelings
for you.

442
00:18:26,457 --> 00:18:28,285
And you still have feelings
for her,

443
00:18:28,372 --> 00:18:30,809
despite taking a lover whose
charm and wit is only matched

444
00:18:30,896 --> 00:18:32,768
by his unbridled passion
in the boudoir.

445
00:18:32,855 --> 00:18:35,814
I do miss you.

446
00:18:35,901 --> 00:18:37,424
I miss you, too.

447
00:18:38,774 --> 00:18:40,036
Oh, how nice is this?

448
00:18:40,123 --> 00:18:42,168
You two should kiss.

449
00:18:42,255 --> 00:18:44,301
Come here.

450
00:18:46,782 --> 00:18:49,262
You two are probably gonna want
a picture of this.

451
00:18:54,311 --> 00:18:56,095
Let's get some
coffee in you.

452
00:18:56,182 --> 00:19:01,884
Okay, I'll have
a half-caff Zach Braff.

453
00:19:03,973 --> 00:19:05,888
[snoring]
Oh.

454
00:19:05,975 --> 00:19:07,150
Perfect.

[doorbell rings,
Walden scoffs]

456
00:19:09,152 --> 00:19:11,197
It's a tale as old as time.

457
00:19:11,284 --> 00:19:14,897
Don't wax your ass to help
your roommate's lesbian niece.

458
00:19:16,507 --> 00:19:17,813
Hey, Waldo!

459
00:19:19,075 --> 00:19:21,817
Hi, Baldo.

460
00:19:23,993 --> 00:19:25,342
Brooke, are you drunk?

461
00:19:25,429 --> 00:19:27,213
No, I'm merloaded.

462
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:30,042
You drank
that whole bottle yourself?

463
00:19:30,129 --> 00:19:33,829
It's okay. I'm gonna
eat later. Shh.

464
00:19:36,353 --> 00:19:37,963
Come on.

465
00:19:38,050 --> 00:19:40,487
I'm sorry.

466
00:19:40,574 --> 00:19:43,229
I never do second dates,

467
00:19:43,316 --> 00:19:45,971
and I was nervous
'cause I really like Jenny.

468
00:19:46,058 --> 00:19:47,233
Hello. Hey, there's Jenny!

469
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:50,193
Okay, nap date.

470
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:52,195
Uh, good idea. Mm.

471
00:19:54,719 --> 00:19:56,634
How cute.

472
00:19:56,721 --> 00:19:59,942
It's like two drunk,
gay puppies.

473
00:20:02,161 --> 00:20:05,251
Ah. They're gonna want
a picture of this later.

WALDEN:
'Twas the night
before Christmas

476
00:20:16,045 --> 00:20:19,613
when all down the beach
not a creature was stirring,

477
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:21,659
not even a leech.

478
00:20:21,746 --> 00:20:24,967
Alan was nestled,
all snug in his bed,

479
00:20:25,054 --> 00:20:28,753
while visions of lesbians
danced in his head.

480
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:32,757
Brooke and Jenny were sleeping, a long winter's nap,

481
00:20:32,844 --> 00:20:35,934
surrounded by bottles
with nary a cap.

482
00:20:36,021 --> 00:20:37,805
Jenny was nervous
and frightened,

483
00:20:37,893 --> 00:20:40,112
but took a big chance.

484
00:20:40,199 --> 00:20:44,073
She let Brooke in her heart,
as well as her pants.

485
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:47,554
While Berta in her vest
and I in my hattie

486
00:20:47,641 --> 00:20:49,948
had just baked our brains out

487
00:20:50,035 --> 00:20:52,995
with a big Christmas fatty.

488
00:20:53,082 --> 00:20:56,824
We started to doze,
