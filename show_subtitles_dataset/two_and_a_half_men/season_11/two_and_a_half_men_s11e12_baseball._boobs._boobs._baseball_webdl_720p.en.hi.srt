Hey, Bar-Bar.
Is Nicole there?

Sorry, Walden.
She's in a-a beating.

I think you meant meeting.

187
00:07:36,804 --> 00:07:38,240

00:07:45,378 --> 00:07:46,466
Hang on.

192
00:07:48,642 --> 00:07:50,296

I hate that she made me lie.

193
00:07:50,383 --> 00:07:51,209
I-I love you.

194
00:07:51,297 --> 00:07:53,386
That was weird.

195
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:54,125
But at, but at least,
at least it wasn't a lie.

196
00:07:58,347 --> 00:07:59,827
You didn't want to
come to dinner.

197
00:07:59,914 --> 00:08:00,828
So, I brought dinner to you.

198
00:08:00,915 --> 00:08:03,700
Oh, great. I am starving.

199
00:08:03,787 --> 00:08:06,703
Oh, Barry.
It's, it's just for Nicole.

200
00:08:06,790 --> 00:08:09,097
Is it because I lied to you?

201
00:08:09,184 --> 00:08:11,229
No. It's because I like kissing
her just a littlebit more.

202
00:08:13,101 --> 00:08:15,582
This is really sweet.

203
00:08:15,669 --> 00:08:18,280

"I don't cook. Love, Berta."

208
00:08:31,815 --> 00:08:34,035
Well... I-I brought you
wine... and cheese...

219
00:08:56,666 --> 00:08:58,842

I agreed to do this,
