A-and for your

22
00:00:53,463 --> 00:00:56,798
I just want to say that
everything you've known about me

23
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,099
Is a lie.

That's okay.
My real name is lawrence.

26
00:01:02,839 --> 00:01:05,507
All right, this is gonna be
a lot harder than I thought.

27
00:01:05,509 --> 00:01:07,408
Um, uh, lyndsey

28
00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:09,844
Is my ex-girlfriend.
When you and she

29
00:01:09,846 --> 00:01:11,379
Got together,
I made up a fake name

30
00:01:11,381 --> 00:01:13,848
So that I could meet you
and stay close to lyndsey.

31
00:01:13,850 --> 00:01:15,550
But then it turns out
I actually like you

32
00:01:15,552 --> 00:01:17,118
More than I like lyndsey.

33
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:19,454

more than lyndsey, too!

and you used to date lyndsey?

37
00:01:28,865 --> 00:01:30,131
For four years.

38
00:01:30,133 --> 00:01:32,066
Did you know about this?

39
00:01:33,536 --> 00:01:35,970
Yes. He was my boyfriend.

Oh, save it, jeff—
if that's even your real name.

42
00:01:43,146 --> 00:01:45,880
I think I made it pretty clear
it's not, but o-okay.

43
00:01:45,882 --> 00:01:48,483
I told alan that I
thought he should
tell you the truth,

44
00:01:48,485 --> 00:01:50,151
Because I thought
you deserved to know.

45
00:01:50,153 --> 00:01:51,953
How could you keep this from me?

46
00:01:51,955 --> 00:01:54,155
I would never lie to you.
This is unbelievable!

47
00:01:54,157 --> 00:01:56,157
I never wanted
any of this to happen.

48
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:59,194
Well, it did— and now
I've lost my two best friends.

49
00:01:59,196 --> 00:02:02,263
And this time I'm not
talking about your boobs.

50
00:02:02,265 --> 00:02:04,999
I don't want to see
either one of you again.

51
00:02:05,001 --> 00:02:07,168
And I'm still not talking
about your boobs!

52
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:08,837

I didn't want to tell him.

you blew up his entire life,

either wants to kick your ass,

Or rip your face off so you
can watch him kick your ass.

Oh, this is all my fault.

94
00:03:46,703 --> 00:03:48,336

95
00:03:48,338 --> 00:03:50,571

right from the start—
lying is

00:03:55,245 --> 00:03:56,644

100
00:03:56,646 --> 00:03:58,680

of your actions.

101
00:03:58,682 --> 00:04:00,114

00:04:23,006 --> 00:04:24,472
He can say, "I told you so."

00:06:46,483 --> 00:06:49,217
It is so nice to finally
meet you, evelyn.

175
00:06:49,219 --> 00:06:51,352
Oh, you, too, dear.

176
00:06:51,354 --> 00:06:53,321
How far along are you?

177
00:06:53,323 --> 00:06:55,323
What?
Uh, my mother
assumes that

178
00:06:55,325 --> 00:06:57,692
Since you agreed to marry me,
you must be pregnant.

179
00:06:57,694 --> 00:06:59,460
(laughs):
No, I'm not pregnant.

180
00:06:59,462 --> 00:07:01,829
Are you after my money?
Of course not.

181
00:07:01,831 --> 00:07:05,233
¿estas buscando trabajo
en el mundo nuevo?

182
00:07:05,235 --> 00:07:06,534
What?

183
00:07:06,536 --> 00:07:08,469
Not looking
for a green card, either.

184
00:07:09,338 --> 00:07:11,639
You must genuinely like alan.
Yeah.

185
00:07:11,641 --> 00:07:14,242
This is uncharted
territory for me.

186
00:07:14,244 --> 00:07:16,210
I know. She actually
loves me for me.

187
00:07:16,212 --> 00:07:18,579
I mean, I had to pretend
to be another person

188
00:07:18,581 --> 00:07:20,348
To make it all
happen, but still.

189
00:07:20,350 --> 00:07:22,617
Oh, that is some ring
you bought her.

190
00:07:22,619 --> 00:07:25,219
Oh, actually, that's the ring
my ex-husband got me.

191
00:07:25,221 --> 00:07:28,789
But I still had it—
I figured why make alan
buy another one?

192
00:07:28,791 --> 00:07:30,892
My god, you've
found your soul mate.

193
00:07:30,894 --> 00:07:33,761
I know. Our honeymoon is
at her cousin's time-share.

194
00:07:33,763 --> 00:07:36,397
He can't use it, 'cause
he had a heart attack.

195
00:07:36,399 --> 00:07:38,199
We're so blessed.

196
00:07:38,201 --> 00:07:40,168

197
00:07:40,170 --> 00:07:42,870

00:07:42,872 --> 00:07:45,306

So, when's the big day?

202
00:07:52,315 --> 00:07:53,781
Oh, uh, it's

203
00:07:53,783 --> 00:07:56,651
We're just gonna have a small

206
00:07:59,789 --> 00:08:01,756
Oh, no, my parents
have passed away.

207

Oh, we're not in a rush
to go anywhere.

I mean, beach house, no rent...

211

you need your own place.

Well, that's easier
said than done, mom.

213
00:08:17,674 --> 00:08:20,875

if I give you a down payment

Pull my finger.

352
00:14:09,925 --> 00:14:11,258
(digital fart sound)

353
00:14:12,627 --> 00:14:15,629
Classic robot jake.

354
00:14:15,631 --> 00:14:17,231
Alan, can I see you a second?

355
00:14:17,233 --> 00:14:18,899
Oh, did you see jake came
to the wedding?

356
00:14:18,901 --> 00:14:21,902
Sure, of course. Hello, jake.

357
00:14:27,175 --> 00:14:29,176
Hey, larry.

358
00:14:29,178 --> 00:14:30,844
Hey.

359
00:14:30,846 --> 00:14:33,180
You're looking...
Pretty pensive.

360
00:14:33,182 --> 00:14:36,317
Oh, thanks, it's a rental.

361
00:14:36,319 --> 00:14:39,720
You look pretty
pensive, too.

362
00:14:39,722 --> 00:14:41,655
Actually...

363
00:14:41,657 --> 00:14:43,357
Thank you.

364
00:14:43,359 --> 00:14:47,928
Uh, hey, I just wanted
to say that it's, um...

365
00:14:47,930 --> 00:14:50,130
It's pretty big of you
to forgive alan the way you did.

366
00:14:50,132 --> 00:14:52,099
I mean,

367
00:14:52,101 --> 00:14:54,635
After hearing that he was
still sleeping with lyndsey

368
00:14:54,637 --> 00:14:56,370
When you two
were dating...

369
00:14:57,339 --> 00:15:00,074
Is apparently something
you're hearing

370
00:15:00,076 --> 00:15:02,042
For the first time
right now.

371
00:15:02,044 --> 00:15:04,044
Are you freakin' kidding me?
They were cheating?

372
00:15:04,046 --> 00:15:05,145
I'll kill him!

373
00:15:05,147 --> 00:15:06,313
Larry, larry,

374
00:15:06,315 --> 00:15:08,215
I'm sorry.
For what?

375
00:15:08,217 --> 00:15:10,284
This.

376
00:15:14,823 --> 00:15:17,191
Okay, let's get this show
on the road!

377
00:15:17,193 --> 00:15:19,326
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What-what's the rush?

378
00:15:19,328 --> 00:15:21,161
Oh, uh,
I accidentally told larry

379
00:15:21,163 --> 00:15:23,063
That you and lyndsey
were cheating on him,

380
00:15:23,065 --> 00:15:25,866
So he wanted to kill you
so I pushed him off the deck.

381
00:15:25,868 --> 00:15:27,868
Let's go! Showtime!
Chop, chop! Come on!

382
00:15:27,870 --> 00:15:30,337
("bridal chorus" playing)

383
00:15:32,273 --> 00:15:33,941
Walden:
Oh,

384
00:15:33,943 --> 00:15:36,910
Wow, so pensive.

385
00:15:38,046 --> 00:15:39,246
Where's my brother?

386
00:15:39,248 --> 00:15:40,414
Oh.

387
00:15:40,416 --> 00:15:41,682
Uh,

388
00:15:41,684 --> 00:15:44,318
He was overcome with emotion.

389
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:47,054
So he hit the beach.

390
00:15:48,190 --> 00:15:51,191
Oh, by the way,
if you trip on your dress

391
00:15:51,193 --> 00:15:54,762
And accidentally flash us,
just go with it.

392
00:15:56,398 --> 00:15:57,865
A-all right, honey,
you look beautiful,

393
00:15:57,867 --> 00:15:59,033
But let's move it along, please.

394
00:16:00,368 --> 00:16:03,370
Uh, jenny, hit it.
(clears throat)

395
00:16:03,372 --> 00:16:06,106
"daughters, mothers, sisters,
we gather here,

396
00:16:06,108 --> 00:16:09,109
Safe from the patriarchy and the
oppression of its penises..."

397
00:16:09,111 --> 00:16:10,844
Oh, I really should've
revised this

398
00:16:10,846 --> 00:16:15,883
Um, wh-why don't we, uh, skip
to the vows that you guys wrote?

399
00:16:15,885 --> 00:16:17,985
All right. Um...
(clears throat)

400
00:16:17,987 --> 00:16:22,723
I, gretchen, do swear
to honor and cherish you.

401
00:16:22,725 --> 00:16:25,359
You asked me to go down
the road of life with you,

402
00:16:25,361 --> 00:16:26,994
And I am answering.

403
00:16:26,996 --> 00:16:29,129
I will go down.

404
00:16:29,131 --> 00:16:32,332
That's what she said.

405
00:16:32,334 --> 00:16:35,069
And I, alan, do swear to honor,

406
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:37,071
Cherish and stand behind you

407
00:16:37,073 --> 00:16:38,772
Whether things are easy

408
00:16:38,774 --> 00:16:40,307
Or things are hard.

409
00:16:40,309 --> 00:16:43,310
(crying):
That's what he said.

410
00:16:43,312 --> 00:16:45,312
Alan, do you take gretchen
to be your...

411
00:16:45,314 --> 00:16:46,847
Lyndsey:
I object!

412
00:16:49,184 --> 00:16:50,084
Lyndsey?

413
00:16:52,754 --> 00:16:54,254
Lyndsey, lyndsey,
you can't be here.

414
00:16:54,256 --> 00:16:56,123
Aren't I a pretty, pretty bride,
alan?

415
00:16:56,125 --> 00:16:57,791
Yes.

416
00:16:57,793 --> 00:17:00,060
You look insanely
beautiful.

417
00:17:00,062 --> 00:17:01,128
Uh, now let's
turn you around

418
00:17:01,130 --> 00:17:02,496
And get you in a
cab. How 'bout...

419
00:17:02,498 --> 00:17:04,465
No!

420
00:17:05,266 --> 00:17:07,868
This was supposed to be my day!

421
00:17:07,870 --> 00:17:09,136
My wedding!

422
00:17:09,138 --> 00:17:11,138
My groom!

423
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:13,807
My f... Wait.

424
00:17:13,809 --> 00:17:15,509
Those are my flowers.

425
00:17:15,511 --> 00:17:19,379
(gasps)
that's my food!

426
00:17:19,381 --> 00:17:22,116
Those are my linens.

427
00:17:22,118 --> 00:17:25,986
(gasps)
that's my...

428
00:17:25,988 --> 00:17:28,422
I think
she was gonna say "cake"!

429
00:17:33,094 --> 00:17:35,829
I always liked her.

430
00:17:35,831 --> 00:17:38,832
So, uh...
So where were we?

431
00:17:38,834 --> 00:17:40,300
Gretchen?

432
00:17:40,302 --> 00:17:41,502
Derek?

433
00:17:41,504 --> 00:17:42,336
Who's this guy?

434
00:17:43,905 --> 00:17:45,172
He's my ex-husband.

435
00:17:45,174 --> 00:17:47,775
(laughing):
Oh, come on!

436
00:17:47,777 --> 00:17:49,409
What are you doing here?

437
00:17:49,411 --> 00:17:52,980
Some crazy lady called and said
you were getting married.

438
00:17:52,982 --> 00:17:54,081
Well,
actually,

439
00:17:54,083 --> 00:17:55,349
What she said was,

440
00:17:55,351 --> 00:17:57,184
"gretchen, pretty, pretty bride"

441
00:17:57,186 --> 00:18:00,354
Followed by two minutes
of intense vomiting.

442
00:18:00,356 --> 00:18:02,022
Pretty sure
that was her.

443
00:18:02,024 --> 00:18:05,125
Boo-ya!

444
00:18:05,127 --> 00:18:06,860
Gretchen, I know I made
some horrible mistakes.

445
00:18:06,862 --> 00:18:08,529
I drank too much,
I wrecked your truck,

446
00:18:08,531 --> 00:18:10,998
I cheated on you
with your best friend.

447
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,966
In your truck.
While I was drunk.

448
00:18:12,968 --> 00:18:14,368
Which is why
I wrecked it.

449
00:18:14,370 --> 00:18:16,537
Lose your dog
and you got a country song.
(chuckles)

450
00:18:16,539 --> 00:18:19,139
I wouldn't know.
I'm more into hip-hop.

451
00:18:19,141 --> 00:18:21,475
I miss you, baby.
I want you back.

452
00:18:21,477 --> 00:18:22,509
Alan:
Hey, derek,

453
00:18:22,511 --> 00:18:23,811
If you want her back,

454
00:18:23,813 --> 00:18:25,479
You're gonna have
to go through me.

455
00:18:25,481 --> 00:18:26,847
Fine by me.

456
00:18:26,849 --> 00:18:28,415
And him.

457
00:18:28,417 --> 00:18:31,351
Look, seeing you in that
white dress right before

458
00:18:31,353 --> 00:18:34,254
I beat up two goobers
reminds me of our wedding.

459
00:18:34,256 --> 00:18:36,857
But this time the cake's not
in the shape of dale jr.,

460
00:18:36,859 --> 00:18:38,492
Which is a
huge oversight.

461
00:18:40,495 --> 00:18:42,863
Derek...

462
00:18:42,865 --> 00:18:44,832
You're not actually
considering this, are you?

463
00:18:44,834 --> 00:18:46,166
I don't know. I'm so confused.

464
00:18:46,168 --> 00:18:48,435
I mean, derek and I have
so much history together.

465
00:18:48,437 --> 00:18:50,404
This is really hard.

466
00:18:50,406 --> 00:18:51,538
That's what she said.

467
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:54,007
(gasps)

468
00:18:54,009 --> 00:18:56,910
That's what they say.

469
00:18:56,912 --> 00:19:00,214
I'm sorry, alan. I-I at least
have to talk to him.

470
00:19:01,617 --> 00:19:05,485
It's times like this
a son needs his mother.

471
00:19:05,487 --> 00:19:08,055
I'm gonna slip out
the back.

472
00:19:08,057 --> 00:19:10,924
Serves you right,
you bastard.

473
00:19:10,926 --> 00:19:12,926
I mean, I love you.

474
00:19:12,928 --> 00:19:16,597
Let's work this out.

475
00:19:16,599 --> 00:19:19,066
Best wedding ever!

476
00:19:19,068 --> 00:19:21,335
Yep! And I got
the whole thing on...

477
00:19:21,337 --> 00:19:25,105
Aw, crap, I had it on photo.

478
00:19:26,074 --> 00:19:28,175
♪ men. ♪

479
00:19:30,645 --> 00:19:32,379
How you doing?

480
00:19:32,381 --> 00:19:34,548
I've had better days.

481
00:19:34,550 --> 00:19:37,351
Hey, I'm sorry, buddy.

482
00:19:37,353 --> 00:19:40,554
Later, I'll run
you a bublé bath.

483
00:19:40,556 --> 00:19:43,223
(chuckles)
thanks.

484
00:19:43,225 --> 00:19:44,958
Gretchen called.

485
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,493
She said it's not over.

486
00:19:46,495 --> 00:19:48,896
She's just sorting things out.

487
00:19:48,898 --> 00:19:50,664
Oh, buddy.

488
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:54,067
"sorting things out"
is just people's way

489
00:19:54,069 --> 00:19:56,470
Of not giving you bad news.

490
00:19:58,239 --> 00:20:00,140
So I take it your...

491
00:20:00,142 --> 00:20:04,077
Mom's not gonna give you the
money for your own place?

492
00:20:05,046 --> 00:20:08,181
I'm just sorting
things out.

493
00:20:08,183 --> 00:20:10,450
You know what?

494
00:20:10,452 --> 00:20:13,086
I didn't really want
you to leave anyway.

495
00:20:13,088 --> 00:20:15,155
Aw. Thanks.

496
00:20:16,291 --> 00:20:18,292
Can you believe it?

497
00:20:18,294 --> 00:20:21,428
We're still together,
three years later.

498
00:20:21,430 --> 00:20:22,996
I know.

499
00:20:22,998 --> 00:20:26,400
I thought for sure
it was over when charlie died.

500
00:20:26,402 --> 00:20:28,468
Thank god I showed up.

501
00:20:31,472 --> 00:20:33,674
You're telling me.
Hmm.

502
00:20:33,676 --> 00:20:35,676
I... You know,
I've been so busy lately.

503
00:20:35,678 --> 00:20:37,411
I-I really miss
hanging out with you.

504
00:20:37,413 --> 00:20:40,113
Yeah. Me, too. You know,
we should pick a night

505
00:20:40,115 --> 00:20:42,382
Where we just
always get together.

506
00:20:42,384 --> 00:20:45,585
No matter what's going on,
once a week, we just do this.

507
00:20:45,587 --> 00:20:47,421
Okay, I like it.
I like it.

508
00:20:47,423 --> 00:20:49,690
How 'bout, uh, here
every Thursday night?

509
00:20:49,692 --> 00:20:51,058
9:00.

510
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:51,725
It's a date.

511
00:20:51,727 --> 00:20:53,460
Uh, don't call it a date.

512
00:20:53,462 --> 00:20:56,196
Just call it...
Two men hanging out.

513
00:20:56,198 --> 00:20:57,698
Robot:
Hey.

514
00:20:57,700 --> 00:20:59,633
What about me?

515
00:20:59,635 --> 00:21:02,302
Okay, fine.
Two and a half men.
