you cornered Bill Gates
in a steam room,

52
00:02:00,525 --> 00:02:02,908
and you pitched him the idea
for Blungogo.com,

53
00:02:02,910 --> 00:02:05,526
and six months later,
you were a billionaire.

54
00:02:05,528 --> 00:02:06,996
Yeah, what you don't know is

55
00:02:06,998 --> 00:02:09,080
that I also got Tased

180
00:06:53,028 --> 00:06:55,260
I cut and pasted Laura Dern's
hair onto your face.

181
00:06:55,262 --> 00:06:56,762
It's pretty breathtaking, right?

182
00:06:56,764 --> 00:06:59,599
I'm sorry... uh, who are you?

183
00:06:59,601 --> 00:07:00,934
Oh, uh, I-I'm Barry.
Barry Foster.

184
00:07:00,936 --> 00:07:03,702
But you can call me "BF,"
as in your biggest fan.

185
00:07:04,989 --> 00:07:06,121
Walden!

186
00:07:06,123 --> 00:07:08,123
Nicole, hi.

187
00:07:08,125 --> 00:07:09,625
I read your proposal.

188
00:07:09,627 --> 00:07:11,492
I'm interested.

189
00:07:11,494 --> 00:07:12,794
Really?

190
00:07:12,796 --> 00:07:14,915
This is amazing.

191
00:07:14,917 --> 00:07:16,248
This is amazing.

192
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:18,083
Oh, my fan fiction's come true.

193
00:07:18,085 --> 00:07:19,718
Barry,

194
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:20,785
we talked about this.

195
00:07:20,787 --> 00:07:22,971
Right, right.
Boundaries.

196
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:26,958
All right, here's-here's
what I'm prepared to do.

197
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:31,062
In return for 51%
of your company,

198
00:07:31,064 --> 00:07:35,566
and him never
hugging me again,

199
00:07:35,568 --> 00:07:37,801
I will back
your project.

200
00:07:37,803 --> 00:07:39,404
I don't think I can do that.

201
00:07:39,406 --> 00:07:41,322
Neither do I.

202
00:07:41,324 --> 00:07:41,905
Barry!

203
00:07:41,907 --> 00:07:43,608
Okay.

204
00:07:43,610 --> 00:07:45,360
Look, I can't give up control.

205
00:07:45,362 --> 00:07:47,411
This company is my baby.

206
00:07:47,413 --> 00:07:50,331
But I will sell you
a minority share

207
00:07:50,333 --> 00:07:52,699
if you agree to work
as my product engineer.

208
00:07:52,701 --> 00:07:54,417
Oh, product engineer?

209
00:07:54,419 --> 00:07:56,453
I mean, do I look like Barry?

210
00:07:56,455 --> 00:07:57,788
No offense, Barry.

211
00:07:57,790 --> 00:08:00,007
Did you hear that?
He knows my name.

212
00:08:00,009 --> 00:08:02,876
I'm sorry, that's all
I can offer you.

213
00:08:02,878 --> 00:08:04,211
Well, then it's a pass.

214
00:08:04,213 --> 00:08:05,878
All right, thanks
for stopping by.

215
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:08,714
No, no, no, come on, this
isn't how the story ends.

216
00:08:08,716 --> 00:08:10,833
Hold on. Th...

217
00:08:10,835 --> 00:08:13,518
That's it?
No negotiating?

218
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:14,887
You heard my offer.

219
00:08:14,889 --> 00:08:16,639
There's also a
supplemental offer—

220
00:08:16,641 --> 00:08:18,773
uh, best friends for life.

221
00:08:19,610 --> 00:08:22,311
All right, wait.
All right, fine. I...

222
00:08:22,313 --> 00:08:24,513
I will... work for you,

223
00:08:24,515 --> 00:08:27,148
but I still need
a majority position.

224
00:08:27,150 --> 00:08:28,367
Good-bye, Mr. Schmidt.

225
00:08:28,368 --> 00:08:32,038
What are you, like, some
kind of evil Bond villain?

226
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:34,022
All right... all right,
all right, fine!

227
00:08:34,024 --> 00:08:36,042
Deal.

228
00:08:37,244 --> 00:08:40,046
I'll... be your number two.

229
00:08:40,048 --> 00:08:41,712
Well...

230
00:08:41,715 --> 00:08:44,699
it'd actually be
number three, but...

I'm coming, Charlie.

234
00:08:51,641 --> 00:08:54,876
I hope you have a guest room
in heaven.

feel so bad.

236

He's in pretty good shape
for a guy in his 60's.

237
00:08:58,982 --> 00:09:00,714
He's 45.

238
00:09:00,716 --> 00:09:02,048
Whoa.

239
00:09:02,050 --> 00:09:04,735
I'll be right back.

240
00:09:04,737 --> 00:09:07,655

241
00:09:07,657 --> 00:09:09,157

00:09:09,158 --> 00:09:11,908
Aah! It burns!
It burns!

243
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:14,329
That's because it's vodka.

244
00:09:14,331 --> 00:09:16,329
Who brings vodka on a hike?

245
00:09:16,331 --> 00:09:18,581
Someone who thinks
hikes should be fun.

246
00:09:18,583 --> 00:09:21,585
Okay, that's it,
I'm packing it in.

247
00:09:21,587 --> 00:09:23,003
I think I saw a mom with a
stroller.

248
00:09:23,005 --> 00:09:24,287
I'm gonna hitch a ride
back downhill.

249
00:09:24,289 --> 00:09:26,039
No, no, no, no, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

250
00:09:26,041 --> 00:09:27,573
Don't leave me alone
with Brooke.

00:09:27,575 --> 00:09:30,209
What? Why not?
She's great.

252
00:09:30,211 --> 00:09:31,627
Well, here's the thing.

253
00:09:31,629 --> 00:09:34,414
She's-she's...
she's always trying to...

254
00:09:34,416 --> 00:09:36,632
get to know me.

255
00:09:36,634 --> 00:09:38,633
That bitch.

256
00:09:38,635 --> 00:09:41,020
She's always asking me
these-these personal things.

257
00:09:41,022 --> 00:09:42,471
You know?

258
00:09:42,473 --> 00:09:44,691
"What are your dreams?"
"What was your childhood like?"

259
00:09:44,693 --> 00:09:46,109
"What's your last name?"

260
00:09:46,111 --> 00:09:47,893
You are just like your dad.

261
00:09:47,895 --> 00:09:49,361
He'd never open up to anybody

262
00:09:49,363 --> 00:09:51,064
'cause he was afraid
of rejection,

263
00:09:51,066 --> 00:09:52,864
so he'd reject them first.

264
00:09:52,866 --> 00:09:54,984
I don't want to
reject Brooke.

265
00:09:54,986 --> 00:09:56,651
So, let her in.

266
00:09:56,653 --> 00:09:59,120
If you don't take a chance,
you haven't got one.

267
00:09:59,122 --> 00:10:00,822
Do you think I really believed

268
00:10:00,824 --> 00:10:02,790
that a complete stranger
would let me live

269
00:10:02,792 --> 00:10:04,626
in his Malibu beach house
forever?

270
00:10:04,628 --> 00:10:07,411

was, "Oh, snap."

00:12:34,304 --> 00:12:35,803

00:12:35,805 --> 00:12:37,305
No, not you. Me.

339
00:12:37,307 --> 00:12:39,774
Me and her have had this whole
"will they, won't they" thing

340
00:12:39,776 --> 00:12:41,860
going on for some time now.

341
00:12:41,862 --> 00:12:43,444
So it's like a...

342
00:12:43,446 --> 00:12:45,428
Ross/Rachel thing?

343
00:12:45,429 --> 00:12:46,614

00:12:47,949 --> 00:12:49,316
Are those friends of yours?

345
00:12:49,318 --> 00:12:51,535
Oh, God. I am old.

346
00:12:53,104 --> 00:12:55,989
But with age comes wisdom.

347
00:12:57,327 --> 00:12:59,042
We're gonna do this my way.

348
00:12:59,044 --> 00:13:00,545
What?

349
00:13:00,547 --> 00:13:02,044

Oh, this is bad.

352
00:13:05,668 --> 00:13:07,334
This is bad.

353
00:13:07,336 --> 00:13:08,635
I'm stuck between my hero

354
00:13:08,637 --> 00:13:10,921
and-and the future mother
of my children.

355
00:13:10,923 --> 00:13:12,505
Come on, Barry.

356
00:13:12,507 --> 00:13:15,726
Don't you want to be
on a poster with me?

357
00:13:15,728 --> 00:13:18,561
Hop on the eagle, man.
Let's soar together.
