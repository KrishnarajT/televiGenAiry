Are you eating
cookie dough?

3
00:00:08,078 --> 00:00:10,078
Yup. It's my favorite recipe.

4
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:12,513
All you need
is cookie dough and weed.

5
00:00:12,515 --> 00:00:15,249
So the only thing
you have to bake is yourself.

6
00:00:15,251 --> 00:00:16,784
It's very efficient.

7
00:00:16,786 --> 00:00:20,088
It causes the munchies
and then immediately cures them.

They found my car.

You lost your car?

What the hell's your
cookie dough laced with?

12
00:00:27,163 --> 00:00:29,097
No, I found this company

13
00:00:29,099 --> 00:00:32,100
And they help you
locate old vehicles.

14
00:00:32,102 --> 00:00:34,635
It's called
dude, where's my car?

15
00:00:34,637 --> 00:00:36,471
So what's so great
about this thing?

16
00:00:36,473 --> 00:00:39,373
I don't know. It's my first car.
I got a lot of firsts in it.

17
00:00:39,375 --> 00:00:41,042
First time I learned to drive.

18
00:00:41,044 --> 00:00:43,644
First time I had sex.

19
00:00:43,646 --> 00:00:45,646
First time I had a condom break.

20
00:00:45,648 --> 00:00:47,915
First time I prayed.

21
00:00:47,917 --> 00:00:49,684
So you gonna buy this car?

22
00:00:49,686 --> 00:00:53,287
No. Some guy named
dirk in denver has it.

23
00:00:53,289 --> 00:00:54,589
So why go through all the effort

24
00:00:54,591 --> 00:00:56,290
Of tracking it down
if you don't want it?

25
00:00:56,292 --> 00:00:57,692
Nostalgia?

26
00:00:57,694 --> 00:00:59,594
It's kind of like...

27
00:00:59,596 --> 00:01:01,295
Looking up
your first girlfriend,

28
00:01:01,297 --> 00:01:03,164
Or your high school
math teacher.

29
00:01:03,166 --> 00:01:06,434
For me,
those were one and the same.

30
00:01:06,436 --> 00:01:08,970
She still writes me
from prison.

31
00:01:10,139 --> 00:01:12,840
I think my math teacher
had a crush on my me, too.

32
00:01:12,842 --> 00:01:15,510
I mean, why else would he ask me
to take a shower

33
00:01:15,512 --> 00:01:17,111
After math team practice?

34
00:01:18,046 --> 00:01:20,047
Oh, oh, good, everybody's here.

35
00:01:20,049 --> 00:01:23,618
Uh, I would now like
to introduce my girlfriend,

36
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:25,620
The very fetchin'
gretchen.

37
00:01:25,622 --> 00:01:26,687
Hey, everybody.

38
00:01:26,689 --> 00:01:28,089
Hi, I'm walden. It's nice

39
00:01:28,091 --> 00:01:29,423
To finally meet you.
Yeah.

40
00:01:29,425 --> 00:01:31,325
Alan, uh, told me that you work

41
00:01:31,327 --> 00:01:33,094
In an animal shelter
taking in strays.

42
00:01:33,896 --> 00:01:35,730
So we have
a lot in common.

43
00:01:35,732 --> 00:01:37,498
Yeah.

44
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,066
Uh, this is my-my niece jenny.

45
00:01:39,068 --> 00:01:40,067
Hi.
Hi.

46
00:01:40,069 --> 00:01:41,235
And we met.

47
00:01:41,237 --> 00:01:42,603
I'm barry, walden's
youthful ward.

48
00:01:42,605 --> 00:01:44,272
It's really nice
to meet all of you.

49
00:01:44,274 --> 00:01:45,506
God, this place
is amazing.

50
00:01:45,508 --> 00:01:47,074
How do you afford
the rent, alan?

51
00:01:47,076 --> 00:01:49,243
(laughs)

52
00:01:50,212 --> 00:01:51,379
What's so funny?

53
00:01:51,381 --> 00:01:53,748
Well, I-I don't pay rent,
per se.

54
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:55,016
Or per month.

55
00:01:56,151 --> 00:01:57,618
Or per year.

56
00:01:57,620 --> 00:01:59,887
Really? No rent?

57
00:01:59,889 --> 00:02:01,122
How long has that
been going on?

58
00:02:01,124 --> 00:02:03,391
Three years with walden,
eight years with my dad.

59
00:02:03,393 --> 00:02:07,061
You have been living here
for 11 years for free?

60
00:02:07,063 --> 00:02:08,129
Yeah.

61
00:02:08,131 --> 00:02:09,697
I have never
wanted you more.

62
00:02:09,699 --> 00:02:10,831
(chuckles)

63
00:02:10,833 --> 00:02:12,567
Who's my cheap daddy?

64
00:02:12,569 --> 00:02:14,635
Would you like to see
the bedroom I don't pay for?

65
00:02:14,637 --> 00:02:17,371
Would you like to see my boobs
I bought with a groupon?

66
00:02:19,441 --> 00:02:21,809
Will you let me get
my grope on?

67
00:02:23,078 --> 00:02:26,047
Nice to meet you, gretchen.
Make yourself at home.

68
00:02:26,049 --> 00:02:27,982
I've got to stop
saying that.

69
00:02:27,984 --> 00:02:30,384
So, what do you say
we hop on your plane,

70
00:02:30,386 --> 00:02:32,753
Head over to denver
and at least look
at this car?

71
00:02:32,755 --> 00:02:34,255
You know you want to.

72
00:02:34,257 --> 00:02:36,090
You guys just want
to go to colorado

73
00:02:36,092 --> 00:02:37,258
'cause pot is legal there.

74
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:39,760
What?
It's-it's legal?

75
00:02:39,762 --> 00:02:41,629
They legalized marijuana
in colorado?

76
00:02:41,631 --> 00:02:44,665
You say up
to three ounces?

77
00:02:44,667 --> 00:02:47,568
Look, we're not going to denver
to look at a car

78
00:02:47,570 --> 00:02:49,170
And bring home
three ounces of pot.

79
00:02:49,172 --> 00:02:51,005
Yeah, but if we go
with you,

80
00:02:51,007 --> 00:02:53,174
We can bring back
nine ounces.

81
00:02:53,176 --> 00:02:54,775

No, it doesn't count

00:03:15,999 --> 00:03:19,200
Oh, it counted... Twice.

There's no way my old car
is worth the cost

93
00:03:28,144 --> 00:03:31,045
Of flying all the way to denver
and putting in a new bathroom.

94
00:03:33,148 --> 00:03:34,682
We can't turn back now.

95
00:03:34,684 --> 00:03:36,350
I canceled an audition
for this trip.

96
00:03:36,352 --> 00:03:37,718
You're kidding, right?

97
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:40,655
The part was
dead junkie number two.

98
00:03:40,657 --> 00:03:44,825
Although, I did buy painkillers
to get into character.

99
00:03:44,827 --> 00:03:47,528
It doesn't matter
what the role is.

100
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:49,764
This job leads to the next,

101
00:03:49,766 --> 00:03:52,500
And you're playing
dead junkie number one.

102
00:03:52,502 --> 00:03:55,303
And before you know it,
you're playing a live junkie!

103
00:03:55,305 --> 00:03:56,971
And then what?

104
00:03:56,973 --> 00:03:58,372
Win a bunch of oscars,

105
00:03:58,374 --> 00:04:01,075
Get rich, fly around
on a private plane?

106
00:04:01,077 --> 00:04:03,244
Oh, look, I skipped to the end!

107
00:04:03,246 --> 00:04:05,546
So what kind of car
are we going to look at?

108
00:04:05,548 --> 00:04:07,682
You can thank me later
for changing the subject.

109
00:04:08,884 --> 00:04:10,951
It's a 1967 mustang

110
00:04:10,953 --> 00:04:13,688
With a 289 v-8,
a holley four-barrel carb

111
00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:14,789
And positraction.

112
00:04:14,791 --> 00:04:15,956
(whistles)

113
00:04:15,958 --> 00:04:17,425
What does that mean?

114
00:04:17,427 --> 00:04:20,695
I have no idea. My dad used
to say it all the time

115
00:04:20,697 --> 00:04:22,330
When we were working on the car.

116
00:04:23,398 --> 00:04:24,699
I like to think that it

117
00:04:24,701 --> 00:04:27,134
Was one of his ways
of saying, "I love you."

118
00:04:27,136 --> 00:04:28,969
Another was,
"why is daddy's beer empty?"

119
00:04:28,971 --> 00:04:30,304
I totally get it.

120
00:04:30,306 --> 00:04:32,606
My dad's coded "I love you"
was, "seriously?

121
00:04:32,608 --> 00:04:34,709
You can't catch a football
one damn time?"

122
00:04:34,711 --> 00:04:36,377
(chuckles)

123
00:04:37,846 --> 00:04:40,114
So you worked on this
with your dad.

124
00:04:40,116 --> 00:04:42,516
Apparently, there's an emotional
connection with this car.

125
00:04:42,518 --> 00:04:43,918
It's a mixed emotion.

126
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:46,787
It took us two years
to restore it.

127
00:04:46,789 --> 00:04:49,423
When it was finished,
it was cherry.

128
00:04:49,425 --> 00:04:51,892
Of course, cherry was also
the name of the stripper

129
00:04:51,894 --> 00:04:54,695
That he drove off with
when he left me and my mom.

130
00:04:54,697 --> 00:04:56,564
Wait— so why would you
want to buy something

131
00:04:56,566 --> 00:04:57,865
That caused you
so much pain?

132
00:04:57,867 --> 00:04:59,867
I mean, that'd be like me buying
the senior prom.

133
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:04,138
It was on my 16th birthday.

134
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:07,274
I go outside the house...
And there's that car

135
00:05:07,276 --> 00:05:08,943
Sitting in the driveway.

136
00:05:08,945 --> 00:05:10,544
No sign of my dad, though.

137
00:05:10,546 --> 00:05:12,012
It was still the best
birthday ever.

138
00:05:12,014 --> 00:05:14,582
Well, until my mom took a
baseball bat to the windshield.

139
00:05:14,584 --> 00:05:17,351
You know what my dad got me
for my 16th birthday?

140
00:05:17,353 --> 00:05:19,387
A box of condoms and a card
that said,

141
00:05:19,389 --> 00:05:21,222
"don't make the same mistake
I did."

142
00:05:22,591 --> 00:05:23,891
He was a joker.

143
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:26,727
How about you, jenny?

144
00:05:28,296 --> 00:05:31,165
Oh, she would've nailed
dead junkie number two!

Having sex in every
room in the house.

148
00:05:38,574 --> 00:05:41,208
Well, to be fair,
the laundry room was more you

149
00:05:41,210 --> 00:05:43,377
Sitting on the dryer
while I took a breather.

150
00:05:43,379 --> 00:05:44,612
Yeah. Next time, I think

151
00:05:44,614 --> 00:05:46,714
I'm gonna throw in
a pair of snow boots.

152
00:05:46,716 --> 00:05:49,383
You know, boom-boom-boom-
boom-boom!
Yeah.

153
00:05:49,385 --> 00:05:52,620
One of the advantages
of being here alone.

154
00:05:52,622 --> 00:05:55,289
Kind of makes a man want
to buy a place of his own.

155
00:05:55,291 --> 00:05:57,525
(both laugh)

156
00:05:58,493 --> 00:06:00,861
Nah, I'm gonna die here,
I really am.

157
00:06:00,863 --> 00:06:03,330
So, uh, what do you want
to do tonight?

158
00:06:03,332 --> 00:06:05,232
You know,
besides this guy.

159
00:06:05,234 --> 00:06:07,868
I would love to spend
the night doing this guy,

160
00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:09,837
But we promised
lyndsey and larry
we'd meet 'em.

161
00:06:09,839 --> 00:06:10,838
Remember, karaoke?

162
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:11,939
Oh, that's right.

163
00:06:11,941 --> 00:06:13,808
Oh, hey, hey,
maybe we can use

164
00:06:13,810 --> 00:06:15,109
My Halloween costumes
from last year.

165
00:06:15,111 --> 00:06:16,777
You know, donny and marie?

166
00:06:16,779 --> 00:06:19,580
Although I'm not sure you'd fit
into walden's donny outfit.

167
00:06:20,816 --> 00:06:24,685
You know, I was thinking
tonight would be a great time

168
00:06:24,687 --> 00:06:26,687
To tell larry that you're
not jeff strongman,

169
00:06:26,689 --> 00:06:28,088
That you're really
alan harper.

170
00:06:28,090 --> 00:06:30,057
Oh, that's funny
because I was thinking

171
00:06:30,059 --> 00:06:33,661
Tonight might be a great night
to not ruin four people's lives.

172
00:06:33,663 --> 00:06:34,829
He's my brother, alan.

173
00:06:34,831 --> 00:06:36,430
I can't just
keep lying to him.

174
00:06:36,432 --> 00:06:38,766
I lied to my brother all
the time. It worked out great.

175
00:06:38,768 --> 00:06:40,367

My dad used to let me sit

00:13:28,177 --> 00:13:29,810
Yeah, my dad
wasn't around much.

354
00:13:29,812 --> 00:13:32,913
I had to teach myself all those
things that dads teach you:

355
00:13:32,915 --> 00:13:34,982
How to ride a bike,
how to shave,

356
00:13:34,984 --> 00:13:37,818

For your success, too,
doesn't it?

371
00:14:14,290 --> 00:14:17,224
I never really thought of it
like that.

372
00:14:17,226 --> 00:14:20,560

00:20:35,103 --> 00:20:37,070
Once you get
the hang of it,

526
00:20:37,072 --> 00:20:38,571
This driving thing
isn't so tough.

527
00:20:38,573 --> 00:20:41,608
How about after I restore it,
I give it to you?

528
00:20:41,610 --> 00:20:43,443
What? You love this car.

529
00:20:43,445 --> 00:20:45,278
I've gotten what
I need out of it,

530
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:47,514
And I'd rather have it
stay in the family.

531
00:20:47,516 --> 00:20:49,349
Who better to have it
than my my...

532
00:20:49,351 --> 00:20:50,517
Sort-of-daughter.

533
00:20:50,519 --> 00:20:53,420
Aw! You're the best
sort-of-dad ever!

534
00:20:53,422 --> 00:20:54,921
Whoa! Hands on the wheel!

535
00:20:54,923 --> 00:20:57,424
Hands on the wheel!
(tires squealing)

536
00:20:57,426 --> 00:20:59,092
Whoa!
Why are you
yelling at me?

537
00:20:59,094 --> 00:21:00,393
You should be
yelling at them

538
00:21:00,395 --> 00:21:01,695
For driving on
the wrong side...

539
00:21:01,697 --> 00:21:04,764
(all scream)
