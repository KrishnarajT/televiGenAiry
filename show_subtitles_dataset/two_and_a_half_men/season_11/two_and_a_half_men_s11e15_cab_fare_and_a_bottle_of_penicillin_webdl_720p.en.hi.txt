Previously on:

2
00:00:04,106 --> 00:00:05,706
So, what happened
between you and your girl?

3
00:00:05,826 --> 00:00:08,733
She wanted to get married, and
I'm just not sure I'm ready.

4
00:00:08,853 --> 00:00:12,518
That's the same reason I lost Lyndsey. You got to
get her back. Don't make the same mistake I did.

5
00:00:12,638 --> 00:00:15,342
I am gonna ask Lyndsey to marry me.

6
00:00:15,686 --> 00:00:17,931
Yeah, I just have to get a ring.
I got a ring you could have.

7
00:00:18,051 --> 00:00:21,819
You must be here to see your
friend Larry, who is also here.

8
00:00:22,224 --> 00:00:23,984
Lyndsey MacElroy,

9
00:00:24,641 --> 00:00:27,688
will you marry me?
Yes, I will marry you!

10
00:00:33,944 --> 00:00:37,362
What's going on down here?
I got up to pee and I heard moaning.

11
00:00:37,482 --> 00:00:39,841
No, you heard crying.

12
00:00:42,343 --> 00:00:43,699
And moaning.

13
00:00:44,089 --> 00:00:46,788
You're watching porn
at 3:00 in the morning?

14
00:00:46,908 --> 00:00:50,408
No, it's that soft-core flick
that Lyndsey made back in the '90s,

15
00:00:50,528 --> 00:00:52,496
Cinnamon's Buns.

16
00:00:53,536 --> 00:00:56,605
Nothing brings me back
like hearing her fake an orgasm.

17
00:00:57,218 --> 00:01:01,902
Oh, listen, I know that breakups are hard, but...
Uh, please tell me those were for crying.

18
00:01:02,935 --> 00:01:06,825
Uh, uh, crying, yes,
very upset, very upset, yes.

19
00:01:07,862 --> 00:01:09,714
Wow, you know, you're
a classy guy, Alan.

20
00:01:09,834 --> 00:01:14,146
It's hard to understand why she accepted
Larry's proposal and not yours.

21
00:01:14,266 --> 00:01:16,651
Technically, I never
actually proposed.

22
00:01:16,771 --> 00:01:17,493
What?

23
00:01:17,613 --> 00:01:19,617
Well, when I got there
he was already doing it,

24
00:01:19,737 --> 00:01:24,231
so I just figured I'd chalk this one
up as another loss and move on.

25
00:01:24,351 --> 00:01:28,427
Universe: 82,223;
Alan: 12.

26
00:01:28,547 --> 00:01:33,025
Come on, you're exaggerating.
You have not had 12 victories.

27
00:01:33,976 --> 00:01:38,099
Yes, I have. Uh, my son, plus the number
of years I've lived here rent-free.

28
00:01:40,145 --> 00:01:44,029
I can't believe you just stood there while another guy
proposed to your girl and you didn't say anything.

29
00:01:44,149 --> 00:01:45,956
There's nothing I can do about it.

30
00:01:46,076 --> 00:01:48,657
Larry's the one frosting her muffins now.

31
00:01:48,777 --> 00:01:52,224
Have we learned nothing
from Cinnamon's Buns?

32
00:01:52,850 --> 00:01:56,847
She told Master Baker no five times!

33
00:01:57,711 --> 00:01:59,331
Did he listen? No!

34
00:02:01,058 --> 00:02:04,043
No, the only reason Lyndsey settled for Larry

35
00:02:04,163 --> 00:02:07,027
is 'cause she didn't know
she could settle for you!

36
00:02:07,346 --> 00:02:10,755
You're right. I mean, you're a handsome
billionaire, and you settled for me.

37
00:02:10,875 --> 00:02:14,554
She's just a-a-a divorced,
middle-aged lush...

38
00:02:15,587 --> 00:02:17,627
of my dreams.

39
00:02:17,747 --> 00:02:20,297
That's the spirit!
Now, get up and...

40
00:02:20,417 --> 00:02:21,996
wash your hands and...

41
00:02:22,116 --> 00:02:26,010
burn this couch, and go get your...
surprisingly flexible girlfriend back.

42
00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:27,975
You're right, you're right.
Thanks, Walden.

43
00:02:28,095 --> 00:02:29,787
Oh, Master Baker,

44
00:02:29,907 --> 00:02:32,956
would you like to watch while
I train this lovely young maiden

45
00:02:33,076 --> 00:02:35,147
to churn your butter?

46
00:02:35,267 --> 00:02:36,741
Maybe one more scene.

47
00:02:37,917 --> 00:02:40,370
This is a pivotal
part of the film.

48
00:02:41,541 --> 00:02:43,682
You might need this.

49
00:02:44,276 --> 00:02:46,534
This scene's
a real tear... jerker.

50
00:02:48,466 --> 00:02:51,466

Cab Fare and a Bottle of Penicillin
Original Air Date on February 27, 2014

51
00:02:59,527 --> 00:03:02,142
Hey, Berta,
how about a cup of coffee?

52
00:03:02,262 --> 00:03:04,294
No, thanks, I just had a cup.

53
00:03:05,931 --> 00:03:08,013
I don't know why
you keep her on payroll.

54
00:03:08,133 --> 00:03:11,128
Says the guy I pay
to be my assistant.

55
00:03:11,928 --> 00:03:15,467
Oh, oh, that's still a thing?
Oh, oh, cup of joe coming right up, boss.

56
00:03:17,436 --> 00:03:18,844
Hey, what are you doing there?

57
00:03:18,964 --> 00:03:21,597
I'm making breakfast
in bed for Brooke.

58
00:03:21,717 --> 00:03:23,549
Hey, what tastes good on boobs?

59
00:03:23,669 --> 00:03:25,476
Pineapple rings are always fun.

60
00:03:25,596 --> 00:03:28,010
Yeah. You get the room
nice and cold, and you play ring toss.

61
00:03:28,578 --> 00:03:30,937
Yeah, and with
Brooke's bad boys, you could...

62
00:03:31,057 --> 00:03:33,368
Omaha! Omaha!

63
00:03:36,256 --> 00:03:37,107
What? Hmm?

64
00:03:37,364 --> 00:03:39,405
Nothing. We weren't talking
about your boobs.

65
00:03:40,429 --> 00:03:42,571
Why not? You stare
at 'em enough.

66
00:03:42,691 --> 00:03:43,823
What?

67
00:03:45,075 --> 00:03:47,919
I don't... I never...
I'm sorry.

68
00:03:49,429 --> 00:03:50,649
Where are you going?

69
00:03:50,769 --> 00:03:51,777
I got to get to work.

70
00:03:51,897 --> 00:03:55,368
You can't leave, breakfast sex is
the most important meal of the day.

71
00:03:55,488 --> 00:03:57,708
Sorry. Mwa!
I'll call you later, okay, babe?

72
00:03:59,053 --> 00:04:02,827
No worries. Call me whenever you can.
Oh, God, she's dumping me.

73
00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:06,236
What are you talking about?
Didn't you just hear that?

74
00:04:06,356 --> 00:04:07,932
She's "going to work."

75
00:04:08,597 --> 00:04:12,720
Okay, I know no one in this
house is familiar with it,

76
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,841
but "going to work"
is an actual thing.

77
00:04:16,125 --> 00:04:18,108
It's kind of like "paying rent".

78
00:04:21,662 --> 00:04:23,289
It's not just that, it's...

79
00:04:23,409 --> 00:04:25,153
it's been forever
since we've had sex.

80
00:04:25,273 --> 00:04:26,613
Well, how long is forever?

81
00:04:26,733 --> 00:04:27,927
Two days!

82
00:04:28,047 --> 00:04:29,310
I hate you.

83
00:04:30,814 --> 00:04:33,873
Come on, you and Brooke are great together.
She's not breaking up with you.

84
00:04:33,993 --> 00:04:36,003
Uh, then again,
maybe she is slipping away,

85
00:04:36,123 --> 00:04:39,632
and you're just gonna have to face the possibility
of being alone for the rest of your life.

86
00:04:41,439 --> 00:04:42,991
Oh, my God!

87
00:04:44,511 --> 00:04:47,495
What the hell's the matter with you?
Why would you say that to her?

88
00:04:47,615 --> 00:04:51,295
I'm just trying to prepare her for-for
the harsh realities of real life.

89
00:04:51,415 --> 00:04:54,883
I mean, who else is gonna do it,
her father? He's dead, Walden!

90
00:04:55,003 --> 00:04:58,378
Why are you even here? I thought
you were gonna go win Lyndsey back.

91
00:04:58,498 --> 00:05:02,899
It's early. I want to win her back, but
I don't want to spend the whole day with her.

92
00:05:09,423 --> 00:05:10,448
Alan.

93
00:05:10,568 --> 00:05:13,450
Lyndsey MacElroy, I love you.

94
00:05:13,570 --> 00:05:15,259
You are my world.

95
00:05:15,379 --> 00:05:18,671
I want you to spend
the rest of your life with me.

96
00:05:19,232 --> 00:05:20,489
And Walden.

97
00:05:21,546 --> 00:05:23,874
You're-you're kidding, right?
I'm engaged to Larry.

98
00:05:23,994 --> 00:05:28,391
That's not fair. I mean, if I hadn't stopped at that
gas station to poop, I would have been here first.

99
00:05:30,011 --> 00:05:31,123
Alan, don't.

100
00:05:31,243 --> 00:05:32,874
Maybe this will change
your mind.

101
00:05:32,994 --> 00:05:35,967
Oh, Alan, it doesn't matter
what kind of ring...

102
00:05:36,261 --> 00:05:39,095
Holy crap, that thing's huge!

103
00:05:39,445 --> 00:05:40,690
That's what she said.

104
00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:43,734
I know, not the right time.

105
00:05:43,854 --> 00:05:46,514
What do you say?
I say I'm marrying Larry.

106
00:05:46,634 --> 00:05:48,517
But why?
He loves me.

107
00:05:48,637 --> 00:05:50,074
Not as much as I do.

108
00:05:50,194 --> 00:05:51,330
He has his own house.

109
00:05:51,450 --> 00:05:52,420
I...

110
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:53,959
love you.

111
00:05:54,570 --> 00:05:55,871
I'm sorry, Alan.

112
00:05:56,654 --> 00:05:59,294
You-you really think Larry can
make you happier than I can?

113
00:05:59,414 --> 00:06:01,865
I think I made
the right decision.

114
00:06:01,985 --> 00:06:03,598
You made your bed.

115
00:06:03,718 --> 00:06:05,765
Now let's have sex in it.
Alan.

116
00:06:07,647 --> 00:06:08,837
Good-bye.

117
00:06:13,973 --> 00:06:15,061
All right.

118
00:06:16,069 --> 00:06:20,575
Universe: 82,224;

119
00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:27,421
Twenty-five.

120
00:06:41,617 --> 00:06:42,525
Alan.

121
00:06:42,645 --> 00:06:43,696
Hi, Judith.

122
00:06:43,816 --> 00:06:45,148
What are you doing here?

123
00:06:45,268 --> 00:06:49,195
Oh, God, what did Jake do? Please tell me the
Army didn't let him drive a tank again.

124
00:06:49,315 --> 00:06:51,410
No, no, nothing's
wrong with Jake.

125
00:06:51,530 --> 00:06:53,032
Well, nothing new wrong.

126
00:06:53,152 --> 00:06:55,190
Then what's going on?
Is everything okay?

127
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:59,806
Uh, it's just that I've been having a really rough
day, and I needed to see a friendly face.

128
00:06:59,926 --> 00:07:01,709
And you picked me?

129
00:07:02,673 --> 00:07:04,427
There's that friendly face.

130
00:07:04,547 --> 00:07:07,276
I'm sorry. Why don't you come on in.
I just opened a bottle of wine.

131
00:07:07,396 --> 00:07:08,392
Thanks.

132
00:07:08,512 --> 00:07:10,358
Wait.
You don't need money, do you?

133
00:07:10,478 --> 00:07:12,269
No, not at all.
Okay, good.

134
00:07:12,389 --> 00:07:13,983
Wait, are you offering?

135
00:07:21,477 --> 00:07:22,718
Whoa, nice blanket.

136
00:07:23,342 --> 00:07:25,963
What's with the cat lady
starter kit?

137
00:07:26,083 --> 00:07:29,093
It's my bad-news blanket.
My mom gave it to me when I was a kid.

138
00:07:29,213 --> 00:07:32,166
I know what you're saying.
I have a bad-news bong.

139
00:07:33,397 --> 00:07:35,194
And a good-news bong.

140
00:07:35,773 --> 00:07:38,172
And a watching-the-news bong.

141
00:07:38,501 --> 00:07:41,215
I guess what I'm saying is,
I like to get high.

142
00:07:42,506 --> 00:07:43,700
This about Brooke?

143
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:47,850
She blew me off again. She was supposed to come
over after work, but she said she was tired.

144
00:07:48,808 --> 00:07:52,134
Not having sex with me
must be exhausting.

145
00:07:54,063 --> 00:07:54,970
Look... Jenny,

146
00:07:55,090 --> 00:07:59,889
in any relationship, it's normal for there to be
a lull in the bedroom after a while.

147
00:08:00,009 --> 00:08:01,364
Does the sex come back?

148
00:08:01,894 --> 00:08:03,310
You're cute.

149
00:08:05,047 --> 00:08:07,600
But it does help
if you do romantic stuff.

150
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:08,589
Like what?

151
00:08:08,709 --> 00:08:09,734
Surprise her.

152
00:08:09,854 --> 00:08:12,336
Be spontaneous. Let her know
that you appreciate her.

153
00:08:12,456 --> 00:08:14,852
I guess I could send flowers
to her work.

154
00:08:15,434 --> 00:08:17,145
Ugh! That's so gay.

155
00:08:18,433 --> 00:08:22,831
Well, these are the kinds of things we
have to do as a relationship evolves.

156
00:08:23,238 --> 00:08:27,268
See,
sex becomes companionship,

157
00:08:27,388 --> 00:08:29,822
and companionship
becomes commitment.

158
00:08:30,072 --> 00:08:31,361
Commitment...

159
00:08:31,481 --> 00:08:35,496
becomes complacency, which...
gives way to contempt.

160
00:08:37,239 --> 00:08:41,310
Until you find yourself longing
for the sweet release of death.

161
00:08:42,037 --> 00:08:42,968
Yikes.

162
00:08:43,343 --> 00:08:45,789
I'm gonna go get
my bad-news bong.

163
00:08:49,018 --> 00:08:50,251
Oh, my God, oh, my God.

164
00:08:50,371 --> 00:08:54,110
Uh, you remember, uh, Jake's
seventh grade science project?

165
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:55,832
Wait, which seventh grade?

166
00:08:55,952 --> 00:08:57,170
Second time.

167
00:08:58,015 --> 00:09:01,919
Um, he wanted to study how different foods
would make his farts smell.

168
00:09:02,039 --> 00:09:06,297
Oh, yeah! He'd rip one in Tupperware,
seal it and label it.

169
00:09:07,423 --> 00:09:10,712
To this day, I still remember Brussels sprouts.
Yes. Oh, Brussels sprouts. Ugh...!

170
00:09:11,402 --> 00:09:15,412
Most parents make their kids eat vegetables.
We made ours stop. Yeah.

171
00:09:15,532 --> 00:09:17,965
And then he got rickets.

172
00:09:20,763 --> 00:09:23,359
Oh... oh, it's been
a crazy ride, hasn't it?

173
00:09:27,130 --> 00:09:28,275
Hey... can I
ask you something?

174
00:09:28,395 --> 00:09:29,908
Oh, here we go.
How much?

175
00:09:30,509 --> 00:09:32,261
No, no, not that.

176
00:09:32,381 --> 00:09:34,387
What's wrong with me?

177
00:09:34,507 --> 00:09:35,308
Oh, Alan.

178
00:09:35,428 --> 00:09:39,760
I don't carry around a list of your faults.
My therapist said it's no longer healthy.

179
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:43,025
I'm-I'm serious.
I mean, it seems like

180
00:09:43,145 --> 00:09:45,874
every relationship I've ever been in
I've screwed up.

181
00:09:46,282 --> 00:09:49,298
Oh. Look, a marriage doesn't fail
because of one person screwing up.

182
00:09:49,418 --> 00:09:51,281
I screwed up two marriages.

183
00:09:51,401 --> 00:09:54,563
Oh, yeah, yeah, you're right—
you're a two-time loser.

184
00:09:54,683 --> 00:09:57,284
Uh, but at least I have Walden;
I mean, you've got nobody.

185
00:09:57,884 --> 00:09:59,824
Oh, we're being
honest now?

186
00:10:00,207 --> 00:10:02,602
Herb's penis is
bigger than yours.

187
00:10:04,071 --> 00:10:06,568
I'd forgotten how good
you are at this.

188
00:10:08,570 --> 00:10:10,009
I have missed you.

189
00:10:10,129 --> 00:10:13,825
I mean, you know, not the constant verbal abuse
that left me a crippled shell of a man.

190
00:10:13,945 --> 00:10:16,558
But we could always
make each other laugh.

191
00:10:16,678 --> 00:10:19,869
Oh. You could never find my G-spot,
but you could always find my funny bone.

192
00:10:21,246 --> 00:10:23,185
I'm just kidding.

193
00:10:23,305 --> 00:10:25,302
I've missed you, too.

194
00:10:31,706 --> 00:10:35,135
Oh, yeah, this is, uh...
This is probably a bad idea.

195
00:10:47,908 --> 00:10:49,597
Let's look for that G-spot.

196
00:10:49,717 --> 00:10:52,418
Or... how about
you look for mine?

197
00:11:05,212 --> 00:11:08,935
Oh, God.
What did we do?

198
00:11:13,924 --> 00:11:16,157
Oh, God, what did I do?

199
00:11:33,010 --> 00:11:34,518
Come on.

200
00:11:41,495 --> 00:11:43,438
What did we do last night?

201
00:11:51,029 --> 00:11:52,067
More!

202
00:11:53,663 --> 00:11:55,083
Oh, God.

203
00:12:36,549 --> 00:12:40,847
Well, well, well, someone never
made it home last night.

204
00:12:41,607 --> 00:12:43,947
Am I speaking
with an engaged man?

205
00:12:44,335 --> 00:12:46,731
I think you might be.

206
00:12:47,269 --> 00:12:49,910
That's great. Hey, what'd Lyndsey say
when you showed her the ring?

207
00:12:50,282 --> 00:12:51,713
That thing is huge.

208
00:12:51,833 --> 00:12:53,303
That's what she said.

209
00:12:53,423 --> 00:12:54,923
That's what I said!

210
00:12:55,955 --> 00:12:58,176
She also said
she's staying with Larry.

211
00:12:58,296 --> 00:12:59,511
What? I thought
you said you were engaged.

212
00:12:59,631 --> 00:13:01,839
I am. To Judith.

213
00:13:03,257 --> 00:13:04,954
What, your ex-wife?

214
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,257
Whoa. What the hell happened?

215
00:13:14,184 --> 00:13:16,536
Well, it's all kind of sketchy.
We had a lot to drink.

216
00:13:16,656 --> 00:13:20,946
Well, I-I've had a lot to drink before,
but I've never got engaged to my ex-wife.

217
00:13:21,066 --> 00:13:24,038
Okay, maybe I'm being selfish, but I'd like
to talk about me right now.

218
00:13:24,428 --> 00:13:25,648
Jindsey?

219
00:13:27,003 --> 00:13:28,492
Ludith.

220
00:13:29,011 --> 00:13:31,086
Will you Larry me?

221
00:13:32,642 --> 00:13:34,206
Let me ask you something.

222
00:13:34,326 --> 00:13:38,454
Um, do you think Judith would be more upset,
uh, to wake up and find she's engaged to me,

223
00:13:38,574 --> 00:13:41,256
or to wake up
and find she's missing a finger?

224
00:13:41,376 --> 00:13:46,170
Okay, look, I'm sure that she got tipsy
and caught up in the moment, too,

225
00:13:46,290 --> 00:13:49,379
and if you're just honest with her,
she'll probably be relieved.

226
00:13:49,499 --> 00:13:52,707
What if she isn't? I mean, how do I
get her to want out of marrying me?

227
00:13:52,827 --> 00:13:54,209
Be yourself?

228
00:13:55,028 --> 00:13:56,373
Worked before.

229
00:14:02,823 --> 00:14:04,256
Hey, you.

230
00:14:05,814 --> 00:14:08,391
Um, uh, listen, uh, we should...
we should really talk about last night.

231
00:14:08,511 --> 00:14:11,125
Absolutely, but I need
to say something first.

232
00:14:11,433 --> 00:14:13,084
Things are going
to be different this time.

233
00:14:13,204 --> 00:14:18,503
I'm not going to make the same mistakes I made before.
And I'm going to start by showing you how much I appreciate you

234
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:19,885
every single day.

235
00:14:20,425 --> 00:14:23,353
Oh, that's really sweet, but
we really should talk about...

236
00:14:23,473 --> 00:14:26,519
Who we should invite
to the wedding!

237
00:14:31,166 --> 00:14:32,611
Hey.
Hi.

238
00:14:32,731 --> 00:14:37,410
Guess what. I'm taking your advice, and I'm
surprising Brooke with a romantic evening.

239
00:14:37,530 --> 00:14:40,144
Good. You know, I know
that's not easy for you.

240
00:14:40,264 --> 00:14:42,082
Your dad was the same way.

241
00:14:42,202 --> 00:14:45,686
His idea of romance
was a warm washcloth,

242
00:14:45,806 --> 00:14:48,501
cab fare
and a bottle of penicillin.

243
00:14:49,978 --> 00:14:53,699
Aw! So my dad wasn't just
a drunken, diseased man-whore.

244
00:14:53,819 --> 00:14:55,615
He was a gentleman.

245
00:14:56,785 --> 00:15:00,157
Charlie would be so happy
to see his little girl now.

246
00:15:00,477 --> 00:15:05,610
Of course, he'd be even more happy
to see the rack on his little girl's girlfriend.

247
00:15:06,179 --> 00:15:08,929
Does she have nice boobs?
I've never noticed.

248
00:15:10,504 --> 00:15:11,223
Hey.

249
00:15:12,193 --> 00:15:15,240
How'd it go with Judith?
She take it okay?

250
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:18,193
Uh, well, uh, you know,
she... uh, she...

251
00:15:18,313 --> 00:15:20,775
It was a... a little hard
for her to swallow.

252
00:15:22,471 --> 00:15:25,353
Well, I'm just glad you talked to her.
Can I get my ring back?

253
00:15:25,473 --> 00:15:27,324
Uh, funny story.

254
00:15:27,444 --> 00:15:30,655
Um... she kind of kept it,
and we're kind of getting married.

255
00:15:32,964 --> 00:15:34,658
Alan, I thought
you were gonna talk to her.

256
00:15:34,778 --> 00:15:38,430
Uh, I did. Uh, we came to an...
oral agreement.

257
00:15:40,813 --> 00:15:41,426
Alan!

258
00:15:41,546 --> 00:15:44,777
It's my weakness.
That and red velvet anything.

259
00:15:44,897 --> 00:15:46,976
Wait. Wait.
This is the same woman

260
00:15:47,096 --> 00:15:52,056
that you said was so evil that her image
didn't show up in your wedding pictures.

261
00:15:52,559 --> 00:15:55,105
I only said that because,
at the time, I thought she was

262
00:15:55,225 --> 00:15:58,451
the worst person I'd ever met, and
she made my life a living hell.

263
00:15:58,571 --> 00:16:00,848
But, you know, people change.
It's gonna be great.

264
00:16:03,722 --> 00:16:07,839
So, Zippy's moving out,
and he's going to be miserable.

265
00:16:07,959 --> 00:16:10,373
So you have
been listening.

266
00:16:13,625 --> 00:16:17,185
I have to say, dinner was great, Judith.
Thank you for inviting me over.

267
00:16:17,305 --> 00:16:20,848
Of course. You're Alan's best friend.
Actually, you're Alan's only friend.

268
00:16:22,871 --> 00:16:24,454
It's funny 'cause it's true.

269
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:27,649
Oh, honey, uh, could you pass
the potatoes, please?

270
00:16:27,769 --> 00:16:30,571
Oh, I think you've already
had plenty, doughboy. Mm.

271
00:16:34,425 --> 00:16:39,009
Well, I have to say, I was shocked when Alan
told me you were getting married again.

272
00:16:39,129 --> 00:16:40,911
Oh, you were shocked?

273
00:16:41,031 --> 00:16:45,860
There was a time when just the thought of being touched by his tiny,
clammy hands again made me throw up in my mouth a little.

274
00:16:47,475 --> 00:16:48,851
That's all ancient history.

275
00:16:48,971 --> 00:16:52,498
Yeah, if ancient history
was last Thursday.

276
00:16:56,792 --> 00:16:57,976
Oh, isn't she great?

277
00:16:58,096 --> 00:16:59,062
No!

278
00:17:00,241 --> 00:17:04,971
She's treating you like crap. The only people
that get to do that are people that do it out of love,

279
00:17:05,091 --> 00:17:06,862
like me and Berta and your mom.

280
00:17:07,358 --> 00:17:08,909
Okay, fine. Me and Berta.

281
00:17:09,710 --> 00:17:11,171
Okay. Me.

282
00:17:11,584 --> 00:17:14,776
It's harmless.
It's just Judith being funny.

283
00:17:15,751 --> 00:17:18,053
Did... did you just twitch?

284
00:17:18,173 --> 00:17:21,169
No, I was just talking
about how funny Judith is.

285
00:17:21,644 --> 00:17:25,292
Okay, look me in the eye and tell me how much
you love Judith without twitching.

286
00:17:25,412 --> 00:17:27,506
Fine. I love Judith.

287
00:17:29,239 --> 00:17:30,528
There, I said it.

288
00:17:30,648 --> 00:17:31,549
Alan.

289
00:17:32,301 --> 00:17:34,167
You cannot marry this woman.

290
00:17:34,287 --> 00:17:37,342
You deserve better. I mean,
not much better, but better.

291
00:17:37,462 --> 00:17:40,277
You know who I deserve? I deserve
Lyndsey, but I can't have her.

292
00:17:40,397 --> 00:17:42,875
She's marrying somebody else,
so I'm taking what I can get.

293
00:17:42,995 --> 00:17:45,197
That's what I do.
I'm a love scavenger.

294
00:17:45,317 --> 00:17:49,681
You're also a house scavenger and a money
scavenger and an underwear scavenger.

295
00:17:49,801 --> 00:17:51,620
But that doesn't mean
you have to settle.

296
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:54,085
Yes, it does.
I don't want to die alone.

297
00:17:54,205 --> 00:17:57,348
Maybe you don't realize it, but there aren't a lot of people
who want to spend the rest of their lives with me.

298
00:17:57,468 --> 00:18:00,268
Oh, no, I realize it!

299
00:18:03,705 --> 00:18:05,993
Brooke, really, we can get
a hotel for the night.

300
00:18:06,113 --> 00:18:09,624
No, no, no, Dad. It's fine. I'll sleep
on the couch, and you guys stay in my room.

301
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:12,338
Surprise!

302
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:14,572
Who's this?

303
00:18:15,692 --> 00:18:17,768
Uh, Mom, Dad,
this is, um...

304
00:18:17,888 --> 00:18:19,552
my girlfriend, Jenny.

305
00:18:19,672 --> 00:18:21,696
It's a pleasure to meet you!

306
00:18:23,079 --> 00:18:24,607
I like her.

307
00:18:29,049 --> 00:18:33,711
Oh, hey, I was thinking, now that Jake's gone...
Mm? - ... I can turn his room into my man-cave.

308
00:18:33,831 --> 00:18:37,033
You know, a pinball machine, flat-screen
TV, potter's wheel.

309
00:18:37,153 --> 00:18:39,787
No, that's not going to happen.
Oh, you have plans for it?

310
00:18:39,907 --> 00:18:43,114
No, I'm just not letting you get
another potter's wheel.

311
00:18:45,691 --> 00:18:48,594
Judith, I have to say, I cannot take
my eyes off of that ring.

312
00:18:48,714 --> 00:18:53,523
I know. When I first saw it, I thought it was as fake
as the orgasms I used to have when we were married.

313
00:18:54,479 --> 00:18:57,946
That's true.
Very unsatisfactory lover.

314
00:18:59,359 --> 00:19:02,129
But I mean,
what woman could say no to this?

315
00:19:02,249 --> 00:19:03,860
I can think of one.

316
00:19:05,042 --> 00:19:06,841
Can you think of one, Alan?

317
00:19:08,977 --> 00:19:10,154
Uh, what's going on?

318
00:19:10,898 --> 00:19:15,462
Oh, nothing. I'm just glad that you were there to pick
up the pieces after Lyndsey turned down Alan's proposal.

319
00:19:15,582 --> 00:19:17,819
What? You proposed
to her before me?

320
00:19:17,939 --> 00:19:19,161
Uh, well, technically,
uh, what I...

321
00:19:19,281 --> 00:19:21,163
Oh, you didn't know?

322
00:19:22,566 --> 00:19:24,643
This is awkward.

323
00:19:25,550 --> 00:19:28,778
Open mouth, remove pie,
insert foot.

324
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:31,275
So, I'm your second choice?

325
00:19:31,395 --> 00:19:35,538
No, d-doesn't matter who was second.
Uh, y-you were the first to say yes!

326
00:19:36,051 --> 00:19:40,081
I will be the first to say yes
to seconds of this pie.

327
00:19:40,716 --> 00:19:41,908
You are unbelievable!

328
00:19:42,028 --> 00:19:44,298
No, the important thing is
that we found each other again.

329
00:19:44,418 --> 00:19:47,639
And you're willing to settle for me,
and I'm willing to settle for you.

330
00:19:47,759 --> 00:19:49,197
Settle for this.

331
00:19:54,527 --> 00:19:56,291
I'm a good friend.

332
00:20:03,225 --> 00:20:04,274
Hey. How's it going?

333
00:20:04,394 --> 00:20:06,815
Good. Thanks again
for the potter's wheel.

334
00:20:06,935 --> 00:20:09,876
It's the least I could do.
I cost you a wife.

335
00:20:09,996 --> 00:20:12,061
I'm just glad
you, uh, came to your senses.

336
00:20:12,181 --> 00:20:15,358
Yeah, I was just scared. Didn't want
to spend the rest of my life alone.

337
00:20:16,303 --> 00:20:18,803
Hey, as long as I'm around,
you'll never be alone.

338
00:20:19,406 --> 00:20:21,913
Ah, thanks, buddy.
Oh, shoot. Aah!

339
00:20:22,817 --> 00:20:24,569
Oh, here. Let me help
you out with that.

340
00:20:49,061 --> 00:20:50,605
Thank God, it was just a dream.

341
00:20:50,725 --> 00:20:53,002
Are you okay, baby?
Did you have a nightmare?

342
00:20:59,086 --> 00:21:01,015
I got to get him out of here.
