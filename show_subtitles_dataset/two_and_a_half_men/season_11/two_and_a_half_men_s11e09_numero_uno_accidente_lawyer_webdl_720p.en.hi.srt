1
00:00:09,579 --> 00:00:11,668
I don't usually meet women
as beautiful as you

2
00:00:11,755 --> 00:00:13,452
at a tech convention.

3
00:00:13,539 --> 00:00:15,150
Aw, that's very sweet.

4
00:00:15,237 --> 00:00:17,935
And you were definitely
the hottest guy there.

5
00:00:18,022 --> 00:00:19,981
[chuckles] Thank you.
Although, to be fair,

6
00:00:20,068 --> 00:00:22,548
being the hottest guy at a tech
convention is kind of like...

7
00:00:22,636 --> 00:00:24,638
well, being the hottest guy
at a tech convention.

8
00:00:24,725 --> 00:00:28,554
Although, once, I saw
Justin Timberlake

9
00:00:28,642 --> 00:00:29,468
at a Microsoft party.

10
00:00:29,555 --> 00:00:32,863
Lady boner! [laughs]

11
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:36,824
Yes, he did bring sexy back
to Windows 8.

12
00:00:36,911 --> 00:00:38,695
So, you said
you work for Google?

13
00:00:38,782 --> 00:00:40,871
That's right, in the
modeling department.

14
00:00:40,958 --> 00:00:41,698
Oh, that's awesome.
Like graphic rendering

15
00:00:41,785 --> 00:00:43,482
and 3-D imaging?

16
00:00:43,569 --> 00:00:44,614
More like pointing.

17
00:00:44,701 --> 00:00:47,443
"New from Google,

18
00:00:47,530 --> 00:00:50,533
confusing tech crap."

19
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:53,101
Oh, so you're, like,
a model-model?

20
00:00:53,188 --> 00:00:56,582
Yep. You can't spell
Google without "ogle."

21
00:00:56,670 --> 00:00:58,584
Can you?

22
00:00:58,672 --> 00:01:01,065
No, you can't.

23
00:01:01,152 --> 00:01:03,764
But being a model at tech shows
isn't what I really want to do.

24
00:01:03,851 --> 00:01:05,461
I just do it to
pay the bills.

25
00:01:05,548 --> 00:01:06,897
Oh, I get it.
What's your ultimate goal?

26
00:01:06,984 --> 00:01:08,551
I want to help
teach people to read.

27
00:01:08,638 --> 00:01:12,555
Oh, that's noble.
So, you want to be a teacher.

28
00:01:12,642 --> 00:01:15,166
No, I want to be
the next Vanna White.

29
00:01:15,253 --> 00:01:17,429
[giggles]

30
00:01:17,516 --> 00:01:20,345
Oh, you're serious.

31
00:01:20,432 --> 00:01:23,218
Yeah. I mean, she
has an amazing job,

32
00:01:23,305 --> 00:01:26,177
she wears amazing outfits
and she has amazing hair.

33
00:01:26,264 --> 00:01:28,963
Somebody needs to buy
a new, amazing adjective.

34
00:01:29,050 --> 00:01:31,966
You can't buy adjectives.

35
00:01:32,053 --> 00:01:34,272
You can only buy vowels.

36
00:01:35,317 --> 00:01:36,405
Right.

37
00:01:36,492 --> 00:01:37,928
Only vowels.

38
00:01:38,015 --> 00:01:39,669
Well, I owe you
another drink.

39
00:01:39,756 --> 00:01:41,715
"O."K."

40
00:01:43,804 --> 00:01:48,983
[under breath]: Certainly won't
be any "I" in "U" tonight.

41
00:01:50,288 --> 00:01:52,464
Wow, that girl is gorgeous.

42
00:01:52,551 --> 00:01:53,901
Yeah, she's a model.

43
00:01:53,988 --> 00:01:54,989
We don't really
have a connection.

44
00:01:55,076 --> 00:01:56,686
She's not very bright.

45
00:01:56,773 --> 00:01:58,383
I think she thinks
Silicon Valley is the place

46
00:01:58,470 --> 00:02:00,429
where women go
to get a boob job.

47
00:02:00,516 --> 00:02:02,823
Oh, you want
intellectual stimulation.

48
00:02:02,910 --> 00:02:04,955
Uh, why don't you
watch an episode of Nova

49
00:02:05,042 --> 00:02:07,392
while you're
banging her brains out?

50
00:02:07,479 --> 00:02:09,046
No, I'm gonna go tell her
it's not gonna work out.

51
00:02:09,133 --> 00:02:11,353
Well, if you don't want her,
can I have her?

52
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:15,183
Oh, sure, let's change shirts.
Maybe she won't notice.

00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:16,271
Oh, she's thatdumb?

54
00:02:16,358 --> 00:02:17,359

I was cleaning out my closet

64
00:02:40,338 --> 00:02:41,992
and I found a box
of Jake's old stuff.

He's in the Army.

No, that-that is
a hummingbird feeder.

75

He made it in art class.

76
00:03:07,844 --> 00:03:10,107
And in shop class,
I made a train whistle.

00:03:10,194 --> 00:03:12,327
[imitates whistle]:
Weed, weed!

78
00:03:12,414 --> 00:03:13,807
No, no, seriously.

79
00:03:13,894 --> 00:03:15,373
Uh, one summer,
back in high school,

80
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:17,636
he and his friends
got into bird watching.

81

out in the woods, and they'd...

Don't worry.
All parents are idiots.

locked in the bathroom all day

Oh, look at this.
One of his old report cards.

91
00:03:45,926 --> 00:03:49,668
Oh, you can still see where
he tried to change his grades.

92
00:03:49,755 --> 00:03:51,583
Yeah, he changed the C's.

93
00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:53,890
To D's.

94
00:03:53,977 --> 00:03:56,719
Yeah. That was the year
his bus got a little shorter.

95
00:03:56,806 --> 00:03:59,374
But, you know,
in his defense,

96
00:03:59,461 --> 00:04:01,028
his teacher changed
that year, too.

97
00:04:01,115 --> 00:04:03,726
She went from C's to D's.

Is this how you're
spending your night?

99
00:04:05,467 --> 00:04:07,425
Oh, no, no. Later,
I'm going to shave my back.

Where's Walden?

Oh, he had to take his date

No, it-it's nothing like that.

00:07:14,917 --> 00:07:17,180
You smell so good.

178
00:07:17,267 --> 00:07:18,877
Thank you.

179
00:07:18,964 --> 00:07:21,837
Let's see how you taste.

180
00:07:21,924 --> 00:07:24,970
Okay. All right.

181
00:07:25,058 --> 00:07:25,841
I see the painkillers
have kicked in.

182
00:07:25,928 --> 00:07:28,148
Oh, they sure did.

183
00:07:28,235 --> 00:07:31,238
Right now, you could
do anything to me

184
00:07:31,325 --> 00:07:33,283
and I wouldn't remember.

185
00:07:36,765 --> 00:07:39,289
Did I wink?
'Cause I was trying to wink.

186
00:07:39,376 --> 00:07:42,336
Okay, let's-let's get
you on the couch, huh?

187
00:07:42,423 --> 00:07:45,121
Hey, let's get you
on Nadine. Oh, okay.

188
00:07:45,208 --> 00:07:48,907
All right, fine.
Let's... just rest.

189
00:07:48,994 --> 00:07:53,695
Thank you so much
for taking care of me.

190
00:07:53,782 --> 00:07:55,175
Well, you have a broken leg.

191
00:07:55,262 --> 00:07:57,916
You don't have
any family or friends

192
00:07:58,003 --> 00:08:01,311
and you live on the fourth floor
of a building with no elevator.

193
00:08:01,398 --> 00:08:04,097
So, I couldn't just
leave you on the street.

194
00:08:06,534 --> 00:08:07,274
Could I?

195
00:08:07,361 --> 00:08:09,754
You're handsome.

196
00:08:09,841 --> 00:08:10,755
[grunts]Yeah.

197
00:08:10,842 --> 00:08:12,061
You're... drooling.

198
00:08:12,148 --> 00:08:15,108
I'm gonna get
you some food.

199
00:08:15,195 --> 00:08:18,720
All right, but I have
certain dietary constrictions.

200
00:08:18,807 --> 00:08:22,071
I don't eat wheat, dairy,
or anything with a face.

201
00:08:22,158 --> 00:08:23,507
Although...

202
00:08:23,594 --> 00:08:26,467
I would make
an exception for you.

203
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:31,820
So, you're here
with your niece?

204
00:08:31,907 --> 00:08:34,170
Uh, yeah, she just recently
came out of the closet

205
00:08:34,257 --> 00:08:36,912
and she's painfully shy. Oh. Mm-hmm.

206
00:08:40,742 --> 00:08:43,179
Now, that's what I
call breast-feeding.

207
00:08:45,312 --> 00:08:47,357
She's, uh, still trying
to find her gay legs.

208
00:08:47,444 --> 00:08:51,013
Ah. Well, she's lucky she has
an uncle who's found his.

209
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:53,320
[sighs] No, I'm straight.

210
00:08:53,407 --> 00:08:55,322
Why does everybody
think I'm gay?

211
00:08:55,409 --> 00:08:57,411
Oh, that is way too tart.

212
00:08:57,498 --> 00:08:59,848
Um, so, Paula,

213
00:08:59,935 --> 00:09:01,502
what do you do?

214
00:09:01,589 --> 00:09:03,112
I'm an investment banker.

215
00:09:03,199 --> 00:09:05,332
Oh, wow. Oh, okay,
maybe you can answer a question

216
00:09:05,419 --> 00:09:06,724
I've always had.Mm-hmm?

217
00:09:06,811 --> 00:09:08,857
What's the penalty
for early withdrawal?

218
00:09:08,944 --> 00:09:11,033
Well, uh, that depends.

219
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:13,035
How big is your deposit?

220
00:09:14,950 --> 00:09:17,692
Oh, interest is rising.

221
00:09:17,779 --> 00:09:20,173
You know, the longer
you keep it in,

222
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:22,262
the bigger your reward.

223
00:09:23,828 --> 00:09:25,134
Sometimes,
the market collapses

224
00:09:25,221 --> 00:09:28,093
and there's nothing
you can do about it.

225
00:09:28,181 --> 00:09:30,487
Uh, wait. Are-are we
doing sexual innuendo

226
00:09:30,574 --> 00:09:32,837
or are you asking for
free financial advice?

227
00:09:32,924 --> 00:09:35,623
Why can't it be both?

228
00:09:35,710 --> 00:09:37,190
You know,
if you're interested,

229
00:09:37,277 --> 00:09:38,974
I've got a Malibu
beach house.

230
00:09:39,061 --> 00:09:42,499
Oh. Well, if you're interested,
I've got very loose morals.

231
00:09:42,586 --> 00:09:43,892
[high-pitched]:
Yay.

232
00:09:45,807 --> 00:09:47,896
[deeper]:
I mean, yay.

233
00:09:53,771 --> 00:09:56,644
[chuckling]:
Wow.

234
00:09:56,731 --> 00:09:58,646
That was amazing.
[laughs]

235
00:09:58,733 --> 00:10:00,822
Uh-huh.

236
00:10:00,909 --> 00:10:02,693
Wait, it wasn't?
'Cause I can do better.

237
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:04,478
No, you were great.

238
00:10:04,565 --> 00:10:06,044
Oh, thank God,
'cause I can't do better.

239
00:10:06,131 --> 00:10:07,785
Oh.

240
00:10:07,872 --> 00:10:10,919
But there is something I
probably should've told you

241
00:10:11,006 --> 00:10:12,312
before we slept together.

242
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:14,444
Oh, God,
husband or herpes? Uh...

243
00:10:14,531 --> 00:10:17,882
Well, there was
another guy. Paul.

244
00:10:17,969 --> 00:10:20,624
Paul. Paula.
That must have been confusing.

245
00:10:20,711 --> 00:10:23,236
Very, yeah. Um...

246
00:10:23,323 --> 00:10:26,282
You see, for the first
40 years of my life,

247
00:10:26,369 --> 00:10:29,111
I was a man named Paul.

248
00:10:35,596 --> 00:10:37,554
Wow.

249
00:10:39,208 --> 00:10:41,210
You don't look... 40.

250
00:10:41,297 --> 00:10:43,517
♪ Men. ♪

251
00:10:46,302 --> 00:10:50,001
So, so, you were a guy?
With, you know,

252
00:10:50,088 --> 00:10:51,351
an Adam's apple
and facial hair,

253
00:10:51,438 --> 00:10:54,441
and the whole kit
and kaboodle?

254
00:10:54,528 --> 00:10:57,879
Yep, I had a kit
and two kaboodles.

255
00:10:57,966 --> 00:10:59,576
So, so, how did
you get that?

256
00:10:59,663 --> 00:11:01,622
I mean, did you
have to get a donor?

257
00:11:03,058 --> 00:11:04,189
'Cause I've never
seen that box

258
00:11:04,277 --> 00:11:06,061
to check on
a driver's license.

259
00:11:06,148 --> 00:11:11,153
Actually, uh, I-I... I
donated my own organ.

260
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:13,895
You see, what they do, they
take your penis, all right?

261
00:11:13,982 --> 00:11:17,290
They slice it right
down the middle... Oh! La la la la la la la la la.

262
00:11:17,377 --> 00:11:20,162
Okay, I'll-I'll
spare you the details

263
00:11:20,249 --> 00:11:22,077
on what happened
to my balls.

264
00:11:22,164 --> 00:11:26,037
Well, I know
what just happened to mine.

265
00:11:26,124 --> 00:11:27,865
Look, I-I know I should
have told you earlier.

266
00:11:27,952 --> 00:11:30,215
I just didn't want to scare
you away. I really like you.

267
00:11:30,303 --> 00:11:33,131
Oh, and I like you. I mean,
we have a lot in common.

268
00:11:33,218 --> 00:11:35,220
Clearly more than I realized.

269
00:11:35,308 --> 00:11:37,832
Maybe it's best if I go.

270
00:11:37,919 --> 00:11:38,572
Oh, no, no, d-don't go.

271
00:11:38,659 --> 00:11:39,616
You sure?

272
00:11:39,703 --> 00:11:41,226
Yeah, yeah, no, I like you.

273
00:11:41,314 --> 00:11:43,054
I'm just, I'm trying
to process this whole thing.

274
00:11:43,141 --> 00:11:45,579
I mean, for instance,

275
00:11:45,666 --> 00:11:48,886
there's no chance
it'll grow back, right?

276
00:11:48,973 --> 00:11:50,497
What, like-like a
salamander's tail?

277
00:11:50,584 --> 00:11:52,194
No. Uh-uh.

278
00:11:52,281 --> 00:11:54,109
So one day you're not gonna,
you know, sneeze real hard

279
00:11:54,196 --> 00:11:57,199
and suddenly
I'm dating a dude?

280
00:11:57,286 --> 00:12:00,811
Alan, I am as much a woman
as you've ever dated.

281
00:12:00,898 --> 00:12:03,858
But if you're not
okay with this, it's... No, no, no, you know what?

282
00:12:03,945 --> 00:12:06,904
I am not going to let one
little thing come between us.

283
00:12:06,991 --> 00:12:09,429
Oh, it wasn't little.

284
00:12:09,516 --> 00:12:12,432
Okay, uh, Paula, bit of,
uh, relationship advice?

285
00:12:12,519 --> 00:12:14,085
Uh, no guy likes to hear

286
00:12:14,172 --> 00:12:16,784
that his girlfriend
had a bigger penis than he does.

287
00:12:16,871 --> 00:12:18,568
You're right. [chuckles]

288
00:12:18,655 --> 00:12:20,048
I'm sorry.

289
00:12:20,135 --> 00:12:21,789
[sneezes]

290
00:12:21,876 --> 00:12:23,878
Sorry.

291
00:12:26,576 --> 00:12:28,535
Gesundheit.

292
00:12:32,103 --> 00:12:33,931
Morning. Morning.

293
00:12:34,018 --> 00:12:36,499
Oh great, we're
out of bacon.

294
00:12:36,586 --> 00:12:37,805
Whoa.

295
00:12:40,851 --> 00:12:43,158
We're out of naked
Heidi Klum.

296
00:12:45,029 --> 00:12:46,770
Damn.

297
00:12:46,857 --> 00:12:49,251
That's Frank. He belongs
to my date Nadine.

298
00:12:49,338 --> 00:12:51,558
Alan told me about her.

299
00:12:51,645 --> 00:12:53,734
That's the model
you took to the emergency room.

300
00:12:53,821 --> 00:12:57,520
Twice. She calls it our
"special place."

301
00:12:57,607 --> 00:12:58,478
It's the worst date of my life.

302
00:12:58,565 --> 00:13:00,131
Is her mouth broken?

303
00:13:00,218 --> 00:13:02,525
No.

304
00:13:02,612 --> 00:13:04,048
So what's the problem?

305
00:13:04,135 --> 00:13:05,659
The problem is,
we have no connection.

306
00:13:05,746 --> 00:13:07,704
How can I be attracted
to a woman's body

307
00:13:07,791 --> 00:13:09,489
if I'm not attracted
to her mind?

308
00:13:09,576 --> 00:13:11,142
Sounds kind of gay,
but all right.

309
00:13:11,229 --> 00:13:13,362
Hey, Walden.

310
00:13:13,449 --> 00:13:15,408
Jenny.

311
00:13:17,627 --> 00:13:19,368
Zippy.

312
00:13:19,455 --> 00:13:23,111
Just a heads-up, there's a girl
asleep on the couch.

313
00:13:23,198 --> 00:13:25,896
Don't worry,
I know the drill, boss.

314
00:13:25,983 --> 00:13:28,943
Give her 500 bucks,
pat her down for silverware

315
00:13:29,030 --> 00:13:31,032
and throw her in a taxi.

316
00:13:31,119 --> 00:13:32,207
What?

317
00:13:33,382 --> 00:13:35,558
Sorry. Charlie flashback.

318
00:13:38,169 --> 00:13:39,040
Morning.

319
00:13:39,127 --> 00:13:40,258
[snorts]Whoa!

320
00:13:40,345 --> 00:13:42,739
That's a pig.

321
00:13:42,826 --> 00:13:44,872
Whoa! That's a leech.

322
00:13:46,874 --> 00:13:48,528
Long story, crazy night.

323
00:13:48,615 --> 00:13:51,139
[scoffs] Pig or no pig,
not as crazy as mine.

324
00:13:51,226 --> 00:13:53,358
100 bucks says mine beats yours.

325
00:13:53,446 --> 00:13:55,926
I had sex with a woman
who used to be a man.

326
00:13:56,013 --> 00:13:58,451
And we have a winner.

327
00:13:58,538 --> 00:14:00,235
What, really?

328
00:14:00,322 --> 00:14:01,410
I can't believe
that you would...

329
00:14:01,497 --> 00:14:04,326
Well, ah, then again, it's you.

330
00:14:04,413 --> 00:14:06,328
Hey, hey, say what you want,

331
00:14:06,415 --> 00:14:08,156
but she really
knows her way around a man.

332
00:14:08,243 --> 00:14:10,288
It's like climbing Mount Everest
with a really good Sherpa.

333
00:14:10,375 --> 00:14:14,162
Yeah, but you don't
shtupthe Sherpa.

334
00:14:14,249 --> 00:14:17,948
How did it work?
Like, where did it... go?

335
00:14:18,035 --> 00:14:19,472
Oh, that's easy.
See, what they do is,

336
00:14:19,559 --> 00:14:20,777
they slice the penis
down the middle...

337
00:14:20,864 --> 00:14:23,214
Oh. La la la la la.La la la la la.

338
00:14:23,301 --> 00:14:25,303
NADINE:
Walden?

339
00:14:25,390 --> 00:14:28,872
Is there somewhere
I can take a bath?

340
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:30,831
Oh, yeah, upstairs.
Here, I'll help you.

341
00:14:30,918 --> 00:14:32,267
No.

342
00:14:32,354 --> 00:14:33,964
I will never get out of here

343
00:14:34,051 --> 00:14:36,271
if I don't start
to do things on my own.

344
00:14:36,358 --> 00:14:39,796
Unless you don't
want me to leave.

345
00:14:39,883 --> 00:14:41,406
Top of the stairs, on the left.

346
00:14:44,322 --> 00:14:45,715
That girl is really messed up.

347
00:14:45,802 --> 00:14:47,151
The only thing wrong with mine

348
00:14:47,238 --> 00:14:49,284
is the occasional
five o'clock shadow.

349
00:14:49,371 --> 00:14:51,939
