1
00:00:08,432 --> 00:00:10,173
Alan!

2
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:11,478
I have to meet Larry for dinner.

3
00:00:11,566 --> 00:00:12,741
Are you ready yet?

4
00:00:12,828 --> 00:00:16,005
ALAN:
The question is: are you?

5
00:00:22,315 --> 00:00:25,318
[muffled]:
Happy anniversary, baby.

6
00:00:25,405 --> 00:00:26,842
What?

7
00:00:33,326 --> 00:00:35,024
Six months ago today,

8
00:00:35,111 --> 00:00:36,547
we cheated on Larry
for the first time.

9
00:00:36,634 --> 00:00:39,681
So, to commemorate the occasion,

10
00:00:39,768 --> 00:00:42,422
you donned the traditional
balloon underpants?

11
00:00:42,509 --> 00:00:43,815
Exactly.

12
00:00:43,902 --> 00:00:47,297
I have a "heart-on"
for you.

13
00:00:48,341 --> 00:00:49,908
Charming.

14
00:00:49,995 --> 00:00:51,693
Yeah, I was gonna get you
a dozen roses,

15
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:53,390
but I-I thought
the balloons were cuter.

16
00:00:53,477 --> 00:00:54,609
Cheaper.

17
00:00:54,696 --> 00:00:57,133
Six of one, half off the other.

18
00:00:57,220 --> 00:00:59,614
I'm not sure this is something
we should be celebrating.

19
00:00:59,701 --> 00:01:02,312
Come on, you have loved
every chapter

20
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:04,357
in our book of forbidden trysts.

21
00:01:04,444 --> 00:01:06,533
That magical night in the
handicapped stall at Chili's.

22
00:01:08,797 --> 00:01:11,364
The time we put a scare into
that field trip of sixth graders

23
00:01:11,451 --> 00:01:12,583
at the planetarium
when they saw Uranus.

24
00:01:17,544 --> 00:01:21,810
That weekend that
Larry went back east

25
00:01:21,897 --> 00:01:23,725
and we went "down south."

26
00:01:23,812 --> 00:01:26,641
Alan... I don't have
time for this.

27
00:01:26,728 --> 00:01:28,817
Well, then open your present.

28
00:01:28,904 --> 00:01:32,298
Spoiler alert: it's my penis
and two of his friends.

29
00:01:32,385 --> 00:01:35,084
And you can't return it
if it's the wrong size.

30
00:01:35,171 --> 00:01:37,739
As fun as all this is,
I only have about ten minutes

31
00:01:37,826 --> 00:01:40,480
before I have to go meet Larry,
so we got to make this quick.

32
00:01:40,567 --> 00:01:42,004
Ooh, my specialty.

33
00:01:42,091 --> 00:01:44,528
First, I'm getting
rid of these balloons.

34
00:01:47,444 --> 00:01:49,315
Oh. Oh.

35
00:01:49,402 --> 00:01:51,927
I-I should've had you
blow them up.

36
00:01:52,014 --> 00:01:54,407
[high-pitched]:
I know what you like, baby.

37
00:01:54,494 --> 00:01:57,236
♪ Men, men, men, men, manly men,
men, men ♪

38
00:01:57,323 --> 00:02:00,022
♪ Ah. ** Men. ♪

39
00:02:04,243 --> 00:02:04,853
Hey, bitches.

40
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:07,769
Hey.
Hey.

41
00:02:07,856 --> 00:02:09,292
What are you guys up to tonight?

42
00:02:09,379 --> 00:02:10,685
Oh, dinner and game night.

43
00:02:10,772 --> 00:02:12,556
My ex-wife and I
used to do that.

44
00:02:12,643 --> 00:02:15,690
Our favorite game was Life,
until she ruined mine.

45
00:02:15,777 --> 00:02:18,127
Yeah, we're more fans of
Monopoly, Backgammon...

46
00:02:18,214 --> 00:02:19,998
Hungry Hungry Lesbos.

47
00:02:20,085 --> 00:02:22,697
It's like Hungry Hungry Hippos,
but we don't eat balls.

48
00:02:25,482 --> 00:02:27,789
How do you know
when you've won that game?

49
00:02:27,876 --> 00:02:29,616
Trust me, you know.

50
00:02:29,704 --> 00:02:30,574
Hey, something smells good.

51
00:02:30,661 --> 00:02:33,142
Yeah, we play that, too.

52
00:02:34,970 --> 00:02:36,449
Hey, you guys want to
join us for dinner?

53
00:02:36,536 --> 00:02:37,755
Oh, no, I can't.
I'm going to the movies.

54
00:02:37,842 --> 00:02:39,888
Oh, Alan, you
want to join?

55
00:02:39,975 --> 00:02:42,499
Is it a porn movie?

56
00:02:42,586 --> 00:02:47,852
Why would I invite a guy
to watch a porn in a theater?

57
00:02:47,939 --> 00:02:49,593
So nobody weird
sits next to you.

58
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:54,816
Well, going with you
wouldn't solve that problem.

59
00:02:54,903 --> 00:02:56,948
Fine. Go watch
your porn by yourself.

60
00:02:57,035 --> 00:02:58,950
I'm not watching a porn!

61
00:02:59,037 --> 00:03:00,560
Uh-huh. And I don't
use your bathroom to poop.

62
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:04,347
Look, I can't go anyway,
'cause I'm having a drink

63
00:03:04,434 --> 00:03:05,740
with my girlfriend's boyfriend.

64
00:03:05,827 --> 00:03:07,959
Why don't you poop
in his toilet?

65
00:03:08,046 --> 00:03:09,526
You're already
banging his girlfriend.

66
00:03:12,007 --> 00:03:13,530
You got a flat tire.I got a what?

67
00:03:13,617 --> 00:03:16,838
I noticed it when I was
getting out of your car.

68
00:03:16,925 --> 00:03:19,057
Why were you in my car?

69
00:03:19,144 --> 00:03:20,450
Taking a nap.

70
00:03:20,537 --> 00:03:23,148
Why were you
taking a nap in my car?

71
00:03:23,235 --> 00:03:25,455
I was getting high,
and I just went to sleep.

72
00:03:25,542 --> 00:03:28,458
Why were you
getting high in my car?

73
00:03:28,545 --> 00:03:32,854
Because you hide
your pot in the car!

74
00:03:32,941 --> 00:03:36,205
Geez! Which one of us
is high, you or me?

75
00:03:41,253 --> 00:03:43,168
[groans]
Great.

76
00:03:43,255 --> 00:03:44,866
Either of you guys
got Triple-A?

77
00:03:44,953 --> 00:03:48,608
You don't need Triple-A
when you got double D's.

78
00:03:48,695 --> 00:03:50,610
Why don't you just
change it yourself?

79
00:03:50,697 --> 00:03:52,525
Eh, sounds like
a lot of work.

80
00:03:52,612 --> 00:03:55,267
I'll just buy a new car.

81
00:03:55,354 --> 00:03:58,009
Or you could use
the spare tire and jack.

82
00:03:58,096 --> 00:03:58,488
Oh, there's nothing in there.

83
00:04:00,446 --> 00:04:04,407
Whoa... there's a trunk
under the trunk!

84
00:04:04,494 --> 00:04:07,236
Somebody's never smuggled
anything out of Mexico.

85
00:04:07,323 --> 00:04:09,891
Here, uh, you grab the spare,
I'll loosen the lug nuts.

86
00:04:09,978 --> 00:04:11,893
Wow, you really know
what you're doing.

87
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:13,503
Yeah.

88
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:15,548
Well, I had a boyfriend
who was a mechanic.

89
00:04:15,635 --> 00:04:17,855
WALDEN and JENNY:
A boyfriend?

90
00:04:17,942 --> 00:04:20,423
Yeah. Well, I went through
a phase where I dated guys.

91
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:21,554
Huh, I thought
you were a goldstar.

92
00:04:21,641 --> 00:04:24,035
What's a "gold star"?

93
00:04:24,122 --> 00:04:26,908
It's a lesbian term for someone
who's never been with a guy.

94
00:04:26,995 --> 00:04:30,346
Hey, I'm a gold star.

95
00:04:30,433 --> 00:04:32,391
Wait a second,
what about that story

96
00:04:32,478 --> 00:04:35,177
about you skinny-dipping
at Boy Scout camp?

97
00:04:35,264 --> 00:04:36,613
Well, I was drowning.

98
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:38,484
I had to grab ahold
of something.

99
00:04:38,571 --> 00:04:40,182
Just happened to be Roger.

100
00:04:40,269 --> 00:04:43,533
So, if you had met Walden
instead of me...

101
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:45,491
Oh, God, no.
[chuckles]

102
00:04:45,578 --> 00:04:46,928
Wow, great.

103
00:04:47,015 --> 00:04:48,451
I'm getting hypothetical
rejections now.

104
00:04:48,538 --> 00:04:51,106
I'm sorry,
you're just not my type.

105
00:04:51,193 --> 00:04:53,717
I was more into,
you know, "guy" guys.

106
00:04:53,804 --> 00:04:56,024
I'm a "guy" guy.

107
00:04:56,111 --> 00:04:57,677
Oh, please.

108
00:04:57,764 --> 00:05:00,071
You made me come in your room
to kill a spider.

109
00:05:00,158 --> 00:05:01,638
I'm allergic!

110
00:05:01,725 --> 00:05:03,379
[chuckles]:
Look, it's not a big deal.

111
00:05:03,466 --> 00:05:05,163
Some guys fix things
and some guys

112
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:07,513
call the guys that fix things.

113
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,515
You know, right after
they watch Project Runway.

114
00:05:09,602 --> 00:05:12,344
Oh, I didn't see it last night.
Don't tell me, don't tell me.

115
00:05:12,431 --> 00:05:13,868
I rest my case.

116
00:05:13,955 --> 00:05:15,217
You know what, I'll show you.

117
00:05:15,304 --> 00:05:16,348
Here, give me that.

118
00:05:16,435 --> 00:05:18,133
Okay.

119
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:20,875
Tell me I'm not a guy's guy.

120
00:05:20,962 --> 00:05:23,312
I got "guy"
coming out of my ass.

121
00:05:23,399 --> 00:05:26,619
Don't... [scoffs]
You know what I meant.

122
00:05:26,706 --> 00:05:28,056
[groans]

123
00:05:28,143 --> 00:05:30,014
God, these nuts
are hard to get off.

124
00:05:31,624 --> 00:05:34,192
Oh, okay, I'll give you
that one. [laughs]

125
00:05:36,629 --> 00:05:37,543
Hey, Jeff.

126
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:39,589
Hey, there he is.

127
00:05:39,676 --> 00:05:41,373
The B-F-F of J-E-F-F.

128
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:42,722
[both laugh]That's pretty good.

129
00:05:42,809 --> 00:05:44,986
Did you just
come up with that?

130
00:05:45,073 --> 00:05:46,552
What do you think,
I just sat here

131
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:48,598
jotting down rhymes
before you showed up?

132
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,080
I'll have a whiskey.

133
00:05:52,167 --> 00:05:53,820
Oh, oh, we're doing
the hard stuff. Okay.

134
00:05:53,908 --> 00:05:56,954
I'll have three fingers
of creme de menthe.

135
00:05:57,041 --> 00:05:59,609
Yeah, I've just been
kind of in a funk lately.

136
00:05:59,696 --> 00:06:00,610
What's going on?

137
00:06:00,697 --> 00:06:01,654
It's Lyndsey.

138
00:06:01,741 --> 00:06:03,526
Mm, Lyndsey. Lyndsey.

139
00:06:03,613 --> 00:06:04,831
I'm sorry, uh,

140
00:06:04,919 --> 00:06:06,572
Lyndsey is...?My girlfriend.

141
00:06:06,659 --> 00:06:09,358
Oh, yes, yes. You know,
I-I can never remember her name,

142
00:06:09,445 --> 00:06:11,403
because, you know,
I never really knew her.

143
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:14,319
Doesn't matter.
Anyway, she dumped me.

144
00:06:14,406 --> 00:06:15,320
She dumped you?

145
00:06:15,407 --> 00:06:16,408
[laughs]:
Oh, my God!

146
00:06:16,495 --> 00:06:18,889
Oh, my God.

147
00:06:18,976 --> 00:06:22,023
I was so shocked,
my first reaction was wrong.

148
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:24,895
Yeah, well, it's been
a really rough two weeks.

149
00:06:24,982 --> 00:06:26,375
Wait, two weeks?

150
00:06:26,462 --> 00:06:27,854
You-you guys have been
broken up for two weeks

151
00:06:27,942 --> 00:06:29,639
and this is the first
I'm hearing about it?

152
00:06:29,726 --> 00:06:30,945
Oh, I'm sorry, buddy.
I should have told you sooner.

153
00:06:31,032 --> 00:06:33,425
Well, someone
certainly should have.

154
00:06:33,512 --> 00:06:35,775
Anyway, there is
one bright side:

155
00:06:35,862 --> 00:06:37,386
at least now, you and I
are free to hang

156
00:06:37,473 --> 00:06:39,388
whenever we want. We couldn't before?

157
00:06:39,475 --> 00:06:42,739
Well, I-I didn't really
want to tell you this, but...

158
00:06:42,826 --> 00:06:43,522
Lyndsey didn't
like you very much.

159
00:06:43,609 --> 00:06:46,656
She said that?

160
00:06:46,743 --> 00:06:49,006
Yeah, she'd go on and on about
your hair and your clothes.

161
00:06:49,093 --> 00:06:50,965
She even said you had
the worst taste in jewelry.

162
00:06:51,052 --> 00:06:52,705
I don't know where she got that.

163
00:06:52,792 --> 00:06:54,490
I mean, it's not like
you ever bought her jewelry.

164
00:06:54,577 --> 00:06:56,448
That's true.

165
00:06:56,535 --> 00:06:58,015
Although, if I had,
she wouldn't have noticed

166
00:06:58,102 --> 00:07:00,452
unless I put it in
the bottom of her wine glass.

167
00:07:00,539 --> 00:07:01,714
Women.

168
00:07:01,801 --> 00:07:04,065
I know how to
kill this pain.

169
00:07:04,152 --> 00:07:05,196
Bring me the bottle.

170
00:07:05,283 --> 00:07:06,415
Yeah, better make it two.

171
00:07:06,502 --> 00:07:07,372
Ooh, and a little
whipped cream.

172
00:07:07,459 --> 00:07:09,679
[chuckles]

173
00:07:12,899 --> 00:07:14,771
Oh, hey, Berta,
can I ask you a question?

174
00:07:14,858 --> 00:07:15,815

00:14:59,627 --> 00:15:02,891
Whoa. Hello, future
Mrs. Strongman.

352
00:15:02,978 --> 00:15:05,023
So, what are you
afraid of?

353
00:15:05,110 --> 00:15:07,330
I don't know.
It's just such a big commitment.

354
00:15:07,417 --> 00:15:09,114
Bottom line:
do you still love her?

355
00:15:09,201 --> 00:15:10,420
Yes, I do.

356
00:15:10,507 --> 00:15:12,553
Then you got to
get her back.

357
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:13,902
Don't make
the same mistake I did.

358
00:15:13,989 --> 00:15:15,207
Yeah, maybe you're right.

359
00:15:15,294 --> 00:15:16,513
I know I'm right.
Chances like this

360
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,341
only come along
once in a lifetime.

361
00:15:18,428 --> 00:15:19,951
I'm gonna do it, Larry.

362
00:15:20,038 --> 00:15:21,518
I am gonna ask her to marry me.

363
00:15:21,605 --> 00:15:23,781
That-a-boy! And when
things work out,

364
00:15:23,868 --> 00:15:25,566
I'm gonna be the best man
at you and your girl's wedding.

365
00:15:25,653 --> 00:15:30,919
Well... we'll cross that
bridge when we come to it.

366
00:15:31,006 --> 00:15:32,703
Want a private
dance?

367
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:34,575
Oh, sorry, I can't.
I have a date with destiny.

368
00:15:34,662 --> 00:15:37,708
Destiny's off today.

369
00:15:37,795 --> 00:15:40,363
Oh, no, I-I meant, uh, uh...
Never mind.

370
00:15:40,450 --> 00:15:42,626
Why don't you take my friend.
It's on me.

371
00:15:42,713 --> 00:15:43,584
Oh, I only have a 20.

372
00:15:43,671 --> 00:15:46,064
Uh, you know what?

373
00:15:46,151 --> 00:15:48,371
I think seven's fair.

374
00:15:51,592 --> 00:15:53,550
[machine buzzing]

375
00:15:56,292 --> 00:15:57,554
Walden?

376
00:15:57,641 --> 00:15:58,424
Oh, hey!

377
00:15:58,512 --> 00:16:00,949
Sorry, ladies!

378
00:16:01,036 --> 00:16:03,081
[machine stops]Man at work!

379
00:16:03,168 --> 00:16:04,779
Wh-What are you doing?

380
00:16:04,866 --> 00:16:08,826
Well, it's a little technical
for the layperson.

381
00:16:08,913 --> 00:16:10,524
What the hell, let me
walk you through it.

382
00:16:10,611 --> 00:16:13,614
What I'm doing is
sanding and re-staining,

383
00:16:13,701 --> 00:16:17,269
when I recognized some
dry rot and termite damage.

384
00:16:17,356 --> 00:16:18,488
And I thought to myself,
what the hell,

385
00:16:18,575 --> 00:16:21,099
I got a couple hours...

386
00:16:21,186 --> 00:16:24,450
why don't I just rebuild
this bad boy from scratch.

387
00:16:26,061 --> 00:16:27,453
[giggles]

388
00:16:27,541 --> 00:16:29,760
The bubbles tickle my nose.

389
00:16:29,847 --> 00:16:32,067
Okay, you know what? You got
to stop building things.

390
00:16:32,154 --> 00:16:34,025
I was wrong...
you are so manly

391
00:16:34,112 --> 00:16:36,288
that if I were straight, I'd
totally bang your brains out.

392
00:16:36,375 --> 00:16:37,638
Well, of course you would,
sweetheart.

393
00:16:37,725 --> 00:16:38,813
But I'd probably
sleep with you once

394
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:40,684
and then never call you again.

395
00:16:40,771 --> 00:16:42,991
Hold still, please.

396
00:16:43,078 --> 00:16:45,297
Yep, they're level.
[clears throat]

397
00:16:47,256 --> 00:16:49,258
[machine starts]Ow!

398
00:16:49,345 --> 00:16:50,520
Aah! Aah!

399
00:16:50,607 --> 00:16:53,044
Mmm.

400
00:16:53,131 --> 00:16:55,569
I'm just gonna rub some dirt
in it and keep going.

401
00:16:55,656 --> 00:16:57,483
Walden! Hey...

402
00:16:57,571 --> 00:16:59,660
What are you doing?

403
00:16:59,747 --> 00:17:01,444
Oh, this? Well,

404
00:17:01,531 --> 00:17:03,881
it's pretty technical
for the layperson.

405
00:17:03,968 --> 00:17:05,361
What the hell, let me just...

406
00:17:05,448 --> 00:17:07,058
No, doesn't matter,
doesn't matter.

407
00:17:07,145 --> 00:17:08,973
Uh, I-I got big news.

408
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:12,063
I am gonna ask Lyndsey
to marry me.

409
00:17:12,150 --> 00:17:13,195
Are you serious?

410
00:17:13,282 --> 00:17:15,371
Yeah, I just have to get a ring.

411
00:17:15,458 --> 00:17:16,851
I got a ring you could have.

412
00:17:16,938 --> 00:17:18,504
The one I proposed to Zoey with.

413
00:17:18,592 --> 00:17:20,332
I don't know,
that ring didn't work.

414
00:17:20,419 --> 00:17:21,682
Neither do you.

415
00:17:21,769 --> 00:17:23,422
[chuckles]:
Touché.

416
00:17:23,509 --> 00:17:26,556
Well, I can't believe my
best friend's getting married.

417
00:17:26,643 --> 00:17:28,645
All right, come on,
bring it in.

418
00:17:28,732 --> 00:17:29,820
Man hug.

419
00:17:29,907 --> 00:17:31,169
Oh. Oh. You smell.

420
00:17:31,256 --> 00:17:33,345
Oh, yeah.
It's awesome, isn't it?

421
00:17:33,432 --> 00:17:34,956
I haven't showered in two days.

422
00:17:35,043 --> 00:17:37,523
That's what guys do...
we stank.

423
00:17:39,351 --> 00:17:40,657
You smell good...

424
00:17:40,744 --> 00:17:41,876
bitch.

425
00:17:48,622 --> 00:17:50,536
Ladies love flowers.

426
00:17:50,624 --> 00:17:52,887
Um...

427
00:18:02,548 --> 00:18:05,551
Oh, hey, Jeff!

428
00:18:05,639 --> 00:18:07,118
Why are you calling me Jeff?

429
00:18:07,205 --> 00:18:09,338
You must be here to see
your friend Larry,

430
00:18:09,425 --> 00:18:11,296
who is also here.

431
00:18:11,383 --> 00:18:13,647
Jeff? What are you
doing here?

432
00:18:13,734 --> 00:18:14,952
[laughs]:
Larry!

433
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:17,738
I-I just, uh, I
came by to-to...

434
00:18:17,825 --> 00:18:20,001
yell at this one
over here

435
00:18:20,088 --> 00:18:22,220
for breaking up with
my friend Larry.

436
00:18:22,307 --> 00:18:24,919
Can you think of a better
reason for me to drop by?

437
00:18:25,006 --> 00:18:27,399
'Cause I certainly can't.

438
00:18:27,486 --> 00:18:29,532
Well, now that you're here, why
don't you have a drink with us.

439
00:18:29,619 --> 00:18:32,448
Oh, I-I'm sure Jeff has
better places to be.

440
00:18:32,535 --> 00:18:33,536
Work, nope.
Girlfriend, nope.

441
00:18:33,623 --> 00:18:35,451
Taste in jewelry, nope.

442
00:18:35,538 --> 00:18:38,149
Here you go.

443
00:18:38,236 --> 00:18:40,064
Bottoms up, Lyndsey.

444
00:18:40,151 --> 00:18:42,632
Not the first time
I've said thatto her.

445
00:18:42,719 --> 00:18:43,981
[groans]

446
00:18:44,068 --> 00:18:45,548
What's this?

447
00:18:45,635 --> 00:18:47,028
A ring?

448
00:18:47,985 --> 00:18:49,595
What's going on?

449
00:18:49,683 --> 00:18:54,035
Yeah, what
isgoing on?

450
00:18:54,122 --> 00:18:56,777
Jeff helped me realize
I don't want to lose you.

451
00:18:56,864 --> 00:18:58,343
These last two weeks

452
00:18:58,430 --> 00:19:00,215
have been the worst
in my life.

453
00:19:00,302 --> 00:19:01,520
I don't want to spend

454
00:19:01,607 --> 00:19:03,131
another minute without you.

455
00:19:03,218 --> 00:19:04,480
Okay, I think
she's heard enough.

456
00:19:04,567 --> 00:19:05,786
Let's go get some
wings. Come on.

457
00:19:05,873 --> 00:19:07,178
Ooh, wings.

458
00:19:07,265 --> 00:19:09,093
Just let me
wrap this up real quick.

459
00:19:11,443 --> 00:19:13,532
Lyndsey MacElroy,
you're my soul mate.

460
00:19:13,619 --> 00:19:16,448
Will you marry me?

461
00:19:16,535 --> 00:19:17,972
I can't believe
this is happening.

462
00:19:18,059 --> 00:19:20,235
Yes, yes, I will marry you!

463
00:19:23,151 --> 00:19:25,980
So, Jeff, how'd it go
with yourgirl?

464
00:19:26,067 --> 00:19:26,850
Uh...

465
00:19:26,937 --> 00:19:28,983
I was too late.

466
00:19:29,070 --> 00:19:31,072
She's marrying someone else.

467
00:19:31,159 --> 00:19:33,596
That was quick.
Wasn't it?

468
00:19:33,683 --> 00:19:35,685
I'm sorry.

469
00:19:35,772 --> 00:19:38,079
LARRY: You know what?
Forget her.

470
00:19:38,166 --> 00:19:41,822
If she chose some jackass over
you, she's just a dumb whore.

471
00:19:43,475 --> 00:19:45,477
Uh, she's-she's
actually really great.

472
00:19:45,564 --> 00:19:46,827
No, she's not.

473
00:19:46,914 --> 00:19:50,004
She and her new man
are both garbage.

474
00:19:50,091 --> 00:19:51,483
[groans]:
Uh...

475
00:19:51,570 --> 00:19:52,920
♪ Men. ♪

476
00:19:58,403 --> 00:20:00,231
Whoa, look at this.

477
00:20:00,318 --> 00:20:02,538
That's right.

478
00:20:02,625 --> 00:20:03,713
Hey, uh,

479
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:05,671
who has one and a half thumbs

480
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:07,848
and built this deck
all by himself?

481
00:20:07,935 --> 00:20:09,937
This guy.

482
00:20:10,024 --> 00:20:11,677
Well, I'm impressed.

483
00:20:11,765 --> 00:20:13,592
I would've had
to call a guy.

484
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:15,377
Well, then my phone
would've rang,

485
00:20:15,464 --> 00:20:17,466
because I amthe guy.

486
00:20:17,553 --> 00:20:19,773
Got to admit, I was
wrong about you.

487
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:22,993
That's all right.
We all make mistakes.

488
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:26,649
Oh! That's my spit cup.

489
00:20:26,736 --> 00:20:29,870
This thing feels sturdy enough
for us to have sex on later.

490
00:20:29,957 --> 00:20:31,045
WALDEN:
Oh, it is.

491
00:20:31,132 --> 00:20:32,568
But, uh, be careful,

492
00:20:32,655 --> 00:20:34,265
'cause I just
stained her.

493
00:20:34,352 --> 00:20:37,355
Well, if you hadn't,
we would have.

494
00:20:40,445 --> 00:20:42,752
Ah. Look at that.

495
00:20:42,839 --> 00:20:46,016
Looks like somebody
needs a new roof.

496
00:20:46,103 --> 00:20:48,453
Luckily, I know a guy.
