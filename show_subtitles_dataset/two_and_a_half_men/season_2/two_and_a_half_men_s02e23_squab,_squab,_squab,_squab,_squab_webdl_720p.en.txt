1
00:00:01,640 --> 00:00:04,757
Hey, Jake, why don't you tell Grandma
about your spring break.

2
00:00:05,110 --> 00:00:06,941
- Bad idea.
- What?

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:10,556
Nothing. I just saw that they're moving
the L.A. Gardening Exposition...

4
00:00:10,878 --> 00:00:15,793
to the Convention Center,
which I think is a very bad idea.

5
00:00:16,229 --> 00:00:19,141
Thanks for the update.
Go ahead, Jake, tell Grandma.

6
00:00:19,489 --> 00:00:21,764
- It was really cool, l...
- Hang on a second, Jake.

7
00:00:22,039 --> 00:00:25,429
I'm not sure you understand
how serious this gardening thing is.

8
00:00:25,759 --> 00:00:28,193
It's a really bad idea.

9
00:00:28,518 --> 00:00:30,315
I get it. Bad idea.

10
00:00:30,608 --> 00:00:32,200
Go ahead, Jake.

11
00:00:33,284 --> 00:00:35,240
I went camping
with Grandma and Grandpa.

12
00:00:35,499 --> 00:00:37,694
We slept in a tent,
we cooked on an open fire.

13
00:00:37,965 --> 00:00:39,603
And we went hiking and saw a bear.

14
00:00:39,888 --> 00:00:42,960
You let him spend an entire vacation
with his other grandparents...

15
00:00:43,274 --> 00:00:44,992
and I haven't had him for a night?

16
00:00:45,281 --> 00:00:47,511
Oh, bad idea.

17
00:01:14,793 --> 00:01:17,023
This is unfair and unacceptable.

18
00:01:17,301 --> 00:01:19,257
From the moment
that boy was born...

19
00:01:19,516 --> 00:01:22,110
Judith's parents squeezed me out.
And you let them.

20
00:01:22,442 --> 00:01:24,000
Interesting point.

21
00:01:24,282 --> 00:01:26,113
Excuse me, Mom,
but when Jake was born...

22
00:01:26,372 --> 00:01:29,091
Judith's mother stayed with us,
cooking and cleaning...

23
00:01:29,381 --> 00:01:32,179
and taking care of him.
- Valid counterpoint.

24
00:01:32,516 --> 00:01:35,633
Exactly. She's a pushy, pushy woman.

25
00:01:35,986 --> 00:01:37,942
Personal opinion.

26
00:01:38,243 --> 00:01:40,040
No, no. You went on a cruise.

27
00:01:40,333 --> 00:01:42,403
But Judith was two days late.

28
00:01:42,674 --> 00:01:44,710
And I had nonrefundable reservations.

29
00:01:44,973 --> 00:01:47,646
Like it would have killed her
to get a C-section.

30
00:01:50,282 --> 00:01:52,876
Self-obsessed psychotic rant.

31
00:01:53,208 --> 00:01:56,359
- Mom, are you listening to yourself?
- Stupid question.

32
00:01:59,186 --> 00:02:01,097
Awkward silence.

33
00:02:02,028 --> 00:02:05,145
You wanna spend more time
with your grandson, he's right here.

34
00:02:05,456 --> 00:02:08,175
No. He goes to visit
his other grandparents.

35
00:02:08,466 --> 00:02:09,819
He should come to visit me.

36
00:02:10,096 --> 00:02:13,293
- So you wanna spend a week with him?
- A week?

37
00:02:14,485 --> 00:02:16,476
Alan, I do have a life.

38
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:19,815
I'm confused.
What exactly do you want?

39
00:02:20,128 --> 00:02:24,167
The same quality time Jake spends
with his other grandparents.

40
00:02:24,517 --> 00:02:25,870
But, you know, less.

41
00:02:27,444 --> 00:02:30,641
I'll tell you what. Bring him
to my place around 6-ish tonight.

42
00:02:30,955 --> 00:02:33,185
I'll make him dinner,
we'll have a fun sleepover.

43
00:02:33,505 --> 00:02:35,973
- Gee, Mom, I don't know.
- Well, why not?

44
00:02:36,264 --> 00:02:40,303
Are you afraid one night with me
will irreparably damage him?

45
00:02:46,338 --> 00:02:47,612
- Yeah.
- A little.

46
00:02:48,261 --> 00:02:52,015
Excuse me. I didn't hear any complaints
when I was raising you two.

47
00:02:52,399 --> 00:02:56,517
The teenage drinking and constant
running away wasn't a slight tip-off?

48
00:02:56,914 --> 00:03:00,623
Oh, you were just
a little drama queen, Charlie.

49
00:03:00,968 --> 00:03:03,118
And let's not forget,
you always came back.

50
00:03:03,435 --> 00:03:06,472
Kind of hard to find steady work
when you're 9.

51
00:03:06,821 --> 00:03:09,381
Whatever. My place, 6-ish.

52
00:03:17,522 --> 00:03:21,800
Judith! I can't just leave him with you
without discussing it with his mother.

53
00:03:22,203 --> 00:03:25,400
Are you telling me you need to get
your ex-wife's approval...

54
00:03:25,715 --> 00:03:28,513
to let your own son spend time
with your own mother?

55
00:03:28,850 --> 00:03:30,408
He had a really bad lawyer.

56
00:03:34,033 --> 00:03:37,469
You know what your problem is, Alan.
You let women walk all over you.

57
00:03:37,795 --> 00:03:39,865
You get that from your father.

58
00:03:41,641 --> 00:03:44,474
Well, nevertheless,
I still have to clear it with Judith.

59
00:03:44,818 --> 00:03:47,013
- Well, fine, call her.
- Right now?

60
00:03:47,911 --> 00:03:50,789
Well, why not?
Unless you'd rather I make the call.

61
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:07,415
Probably not home. I'll just...
I'll leave a message.

62
00:04:10,108 --> 00:04:12,144
Yeah. Hi, Judith.

63
00:04:12,407 --> 00:04:14,875
Listen, it's Alan.
Call me back when you get a chance.

64
00:04:21,771 --> 00:04:27,403
Hello? Oh, hi, Judith,
you old call-screener, you.

65
00:04:28,208 --> 00:04:30,483
Listen, I just wanted
to run something past you.

66
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:34,509
Jake was telling my mom about
the fun time he had with your parents...

67
00:04:34,854 --> 00:04:36,970
and she thought that...

68
00:04:37,613 --> 00:04:40,332
What do you mean, "no"?
I haven't even asked yet.

69
00:04:41,375 --> 00:04:43,525
Oh, really?
Well, I've got news for you, lady.

70
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,950
You can't say no,
she's his grandmother.

71
00:04:47,395 --> 00:04:49,625
Well, she may be that too...

72
00:04:49,903 --> 00:04:53,339
but she's still his grandmother
and this is my weekend with him.

73
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:56,081
Charlie and I turned out fine.

74
00:04:56,382 --> 00:04:58,452
We did too.

75
00:04:58,974 --> 00:05:01,283
Look, he's going, and that's that.

76
00:05:01,566 --> 00:05:02,885
All right then, goodbye.

77
00:05:03,906 --> 00:05:06,022
- It's settled. He'll be there at 6.
- Thank you.

78
00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:09,780
Of course, it is rather short notice.

79
00:05:10,093 --> 00:05:13,927
- Mom!
- Okay. Fine.

80
00:05:14,273 --> 00:05:16,582
But don't get used to this.

81
00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:19,220
I'm not your full-time babysitter.

82
00:05:24,306 --> 00:05:26,103
I played that wrong, didn't I?

83
00:05:26,354 --> 00:05:29,471
No, no. You called mom's bluff
and you stood up to your ex-wife.

84
00:05:29,782 --> 00:05:32,091
You maintained your self-respect,
I'm proud of you.

85
00:05:32,791 --> 00:05:35,225
- Yeah, but what about Jake?
- Oh, Jake.

86
00:05:35,508 --> 00:05:37,339
Jake's screwed.

87
00:05:41,068 --> 00:05:45,186
This has been the greatest day of
my life. Movies, laser tag, video arcade.

88
00:05:45,541 --> 00:05:48,419
Well, that's good.
I wanted today to be special.

89
00:05:48,759 --> 00:05:53,230
- How come?
- Just because I love you.

90
00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:55,242
I love you too, Dad.

91
00:05:55,489 --> 00:05:58,003
You know how people say
you can't buy love?

92
00:05:58,290 --> 00:05:59,882
I think they're wrong.

93
00:06:01,509 --> 00:06:03,147
You hold on to that sentiment.

94
00:06:03,432 --> 00:06:06,185
What's the plan for tonight?
Is it gonna be special too?

95
00:06:06,525 --> 00:06:08,561
Oh, God, I can't watch this.

96
00:06:10,287 --> 00:06:12,721
- What?
- Nothing.

97
00:06:13,004 --> 00:06:14,915
Oh, hey, here's $20.

98
00:06:16,641 --> 00:06:18,120
Wow, thanks.

99
00:06:18,397 --> 00:06:22,754
- You're spending tonight at Grandma's.
- Great. Wait, what?

100
00:06:23,789 --> 00:06:25,268
You're gonna have lots of fun.

101
00:06:25,503 --> 00:06:28,097
- Right, Charlie?
- This is the first I'm hearing of it.

102
00:06:30,059 --> 00:06:32,619
I don't want to go to Grandma's.
Here, take your money.

103
00:06:33,947 --> 00:06:35,858
Come on, buddy.
She loves you very much.

104
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,599
And it's just for one night.

105
00:06:38,127 --> 00:06:41,005
But we were having so much fun.

106
00:06:41,346 --> 00:06:44,463
Think it through, Jake.
Why were you having so much fun?

107
00:06:46,278 --> 00:06:49,031
- You tricked me.
- Attaboy.

108
00:06:49,831 --> 00:06:51,867
What did I ever do to you?

109
00:06:53,384 --> 00:06:55,102
It's not a punishment.

110
00:06:55,391 --> 00:06:57,143
It's not a prize.

111
00:06:57,899 --> 00:07:00,413
- I'm calling Mom.
- No. No, no calling Mom.

112
00:07:00,742 --> 00:07:03,097
I know my rights. I get one phone call.

113
00:07:04,253 --> 00:07:07,689
- I've already told your mother.
- She agreed?

114
00:07:08,558 --> 00:07:10,594
She knows about it.

115
00:07:10,858 --> 00:07:13,133
Uncle Charlie,
can you get me out of this?

116
00:07:13,407 --> 00:07:16,797
It depends. Are you willing to live
in Mexico for a few years?

117
00:07:19,009 --> 00:07:22,240
Jake, please. Do it as a favor
to your grandmother, who loves you.

118
00:07:22,938 --> 00:07:24,371
For me. For Uncle Charlie.

119
00:07:24,652 --> 00:07:27,928
But most of all, for me.

120
00:07:29,376 --> 00:07:30,968
What do I get?

121
00:07:31,591 --> 00:07:34,344
What do you mean?
I spent a fortune on you today.

122
00:07:34,684 --> 00:07:37,642
That was because you love me.
Now you need me.

123
00:07:39,157 --> 00:07:42,035
Oh, God, this is a great kid.

124
00:07:44,173 --> 00:07:45,572
Okay. What do you want?

125
00:07:45,845 --> 00:07:48,405
A motorized Razor scooter,
the new Dragon Ball Z game...

126
00:07:48,688 --> 00:07:51,998
an iPod mini
and not to go to Grandma's.

127
00:07:53,077 --> 00:07:55,147
- I'll give you three out of four.
- Okay.

128
00:07:55,418 --> 00:07:57,488
Forget the iPod.

129
00:07:58,971 --> 00:08:03,487
- This is the worst day of my life.
- Come on.

130
00:08:03,904 --> 00:08:06,976
You're gonna eat your dinner,
watch some videos, play some games...

131
00:08:07,289 --> 00:08:10,804
and you're gonna go to bed and
we'll pick you up tomorrow. Promise.

132
00:08:11,177 --> 00:08:14,089
Your word means nothing to me.

133
00:08:14,438 --> 00:08:16,429
Hey, give your dad a break.
So he lied.

134
00:08:16,737 --> 00:08:21,367
You don't get the virgin to the volcano
by telling her you're gonna push her in.

135
00:08:22,296 --> 00:08:24,935
- Can't we just go home?
- No. Now, enough of this.

136
00:08:25,222 --> 00:08:28,771
- I am the adult and you are the child.
- And this is the volcano.

137
00:08:29,152 --> 00:08:32,349
Now, you're gonna go in there
and you're gonna have a nice evening.

138
00:08:32,663 --> 00:08:34,972
- Do we understand each other?
- Yes.

139
00:08:35,756 --> 00:08:38,350
Thank you. Now, ring the bell.

140
00:08:45,705 --> 00:08:49,015
So exactly what time are you...? Hey!

141
00:08:57,451 --> 00:09:00,045
We've done a terrible thing.

142
00:09:01,046 --> 00:09:06,439
Yeah. If only there was a magical liquid
that could erase bad memories.

143
00:09:10,033 --> 00:09:12,024
I am absolutely racked with guilt.

144
00:09:12,291 --> 00:09:13,849
Alan, don't beat yourself up.

145
00:09:14,088 --> 00:09:19,208
You're a good dad who, in a moment
of weakness, betrayed his only son.

146
00:09:20,108 --> 00:09:21,860
Come on, he's not in any real danger.

147
00:09:22,156 --> 00:09:24,147
Not physically,
but you know as well I do...

148
00:09:24,413 --> 00:09:28,770
that Mom has the ability
to say things that stick with you.

149
00:09:29,429 --> 00:09:32,387
Yeah, forever and ever.

150
00:09:32,690 --> 00:09:35,841
My favorite was, " They must have
mixed you up with another baby...

151
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:39,356
because I could never have given birth
to such a hateful child."

152
00:09:40,089 --> 00:09:42,683
Who writes that on
a fifth-grader's birthday card?

153
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:46,512
How about, " It's no wonder
your father stays at work.

154
00:09:46,819 --> 00:09:49,333
If I could get out of here,
I would too."

155
00:09:50,623 --> 00:09:53,695
Did I ever tell you about the time
I wrote my first jingle?

156
00:09:54,468 --> 00:09:58,177
Pepsi. I invited Mom over to watch
the prime-time network debut.

157
00:09:58,983 --> 00:10:02,658
For 30 seconds, 20 million people
were listening to my music.

158
00:10:02,996 --> 00:10:04,952
And at the end,
Mom turned to me and said:

159
00:10:05,211 --> 00:10:07,327
"You couldn't get Coke to hire you?"

160
00:10:08,347 --> 00:10:10,178
- Nice. But I can top it.
- Go.

161
00:10:10,437 --> 00:10:12,951
It's the day of my wedding.
She's sitting there crying.

162
00:10:13,237 --> 00:10:15,114
And I think it's because she's happy.

163
00:10:15,369 --> 00:10:18,202
Turns out it was because she was,
and I quote:

164
00:10:18,504 --> 00:10:22,702
"So relieved you finally found
someone who could love you."

165
00:10:25,485 --> 00:10:28,522
- We gotta go get Jake.
- You're right. Come on.

166
00:10:28,829 --> 00:10:30,581
Great game, ladies.

167
00:10:36,312 --> 00:10:37,586
- He'll be fine.
- Who?

168
00:10:37,817 --> 00:10:39,853
- Jake.
- Oh, yeah. He'll be fine.

169
00:10:40,157 --> 00:10:41,510
- Who?
- Jake.

170
00:10:41,746 --> 00:10:43,418
He'll be fine.

171
00:10:54,286 --> 00:10:55,878
I thought we'd eat Japanese-style.

172
00:10:56,669 --> 00:10:59,388
Good Lord, are you picking your nose?

173
00:10:59,721 --> 00:11:01,234
I had to. There was stuff in it.

174
00:11:01,518 --> 00:11:03,713
And where were you planning
to put it?

175
00:11:04,026 --> 00:11:06,699
I really didn't have a plan.

176
00:11:07,454 --> 00:11:09,922
Don't you dare wipe that
on my furniture.

177
00:11:10,255 --> 00:11:13,486
And not on your clothes either.

178
00:11:15,396 --> 00:11:18,593
- What are you doing now?
- Putting it back.

179
00:11:20,203 --> 00:11:23,275
Here, just wipe your hands.

180
00:11:23,589 --> 00:11:26,422
- Why?
- Because we're going to eat dinner.

181
00:11:26,724 --> 00:11:29,238
And you've been rooting around
in your nostril.

182
00:11:29,567 --> 00:11:32,161
It's okay. I don't eat with my hands.
I use a fork.

183
00:11:32,702 --> 00:11:35,614
- Wipe your hands.
- Okay.

184
00:11:36,255 --> 00:11:38,052
Thank you.

185
00:11:38,638 --> 00:11:41,232
Has your mother or father
ever taken you out for sushi?

186
00:11:41,522 --> 00:11:43,274
No. I don't like raw fish.

187
00:11:43,528 --> 00:11:46,326
- Well, have you ever had it?
- No.

188
00:11:46,622 --> 00:11:48,214
How do you know you don't like it?

189
00:11:48,754 --> 00:11:50,984
It's an educated guess.

190
00:11:51,304 --> 00:11:54,023
Well, why don't you just try it.

191
00:11:54,313 --> 00:11:57,225
Let's start with the tuna, shall we?
There you go.

192
00:11:57,532 --> 00:11:58,931
That's not tuna.

193
00:11:59,622 --> 00:12:00,771
Oh, yes, it is.

194
00:12:01,043 --> 00:12:03,159
I've had tuna.

195
00:12:04,471 --> 00:12:06,541
Jake, it's tuna.

196
00:12:06,812 --> 00:12:09,042
Now, why don't you just take
a little bite. Here.

197
00:12:09,696 --> 00:12:11,334
Dip it in the soy sauce first.

198
00:12:11,619 --> 00:12:14,008
There you go. Have a bite.

199
00:12:14,629 --> 00:12:17,189
You know, there's a girl at school,
Elizabeth Kurzner...

200
00:12:17,471 --> 00:12:20,031
and her mom ate a bunch of sushi,
and it had worms.

201
00:12:20,314 --> 00:12:22,782
And they grew in her
and crawled out of her eyes.

202
00:12:24,118 --> 00:12:26,996
- Oh, no, they didn't.
- How do you know?

203
00:12:29,343 --> 00:12:33,382
- Just take a little bite.
- Okay.

204
00:12:36,658 --> 00:12:40,651
- Jake!
- It's gross. It tastes like worms.

205
00:12:41,006 --> 00:12:43,315
Jake, stop spitting on my rug.

206
00:12:43,597 --> 00:12:46,316
- Where do you want me to spit?
- Don't spit at all.

207
00:12:46,607 --> 00:12:48,723
- I gotta get the taste out.
- Have some ginger.

208
00:12:50,703 --> 00:12:52,819
- No, Jake, that's wasabi.
- What?

209
00:12:53,086 --> 00:12:55,441
Are you trying to kill me?

210
00:12:55,761 --> 00:12:57,752
No, Jake, don't.
That's an expensive pillow.

211
00:12:58,019 --> 00:13:00,135
Let... Give me that!

212
00:13:06,463 --> 00:13:08,260
Okay, here.

213
00:13:09,932 --> 00:13:11,206
I've just gotta ask.

214
00:13:11,437 --> 00:13:15,874
Playing volleyball on the beach every day,
don't you worry about melanoma?

215
00:13:16,704 --> 00:13:18,979
Alan, walk with me.

216
00:13:19,672 --> 00:13:21,503
Be right back.

217
00:13:22,138 --> 00:13:24,493
- What?
- Listen closely:

218
00:13:24,772 --> 00:13:29,562
No man has ever gotten into a woman's
pants chitchatting about skin cancer.

219
00:13:29,997 --> 00:13:32,192
You can't possibly know that.

220
00:13:34,177 --> 00:13:35,895
Nevertheless.

221
00:13:39,695 --> 00:13:43,244
Let's steer the conversation away
from tumors, okay?

222
00:13:43,624 --> 00:13:48,857
- Okay. So which one do you like?
- One?

223
00:13:51,608 --> 00:13:55,396
God, in his infinite wisdom, has given us
a big box of assorted chocolates...

224
00:13:55,747 --> 00:13:57,942
and you're just gonna try one?

225
00:13:58,213 --> 00:14:02,172
So are you thinking, like, two?

226
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,994
I was thinking, like, nine.

227
00:14:05,528 --> 00:14:07,883
- But we'll see what happens.
- You're not serious.

228
00:14:09,081 --> 00:14:10,400
His will be done.

229
00:14:13,554 --> 00:14:15,033
What else do we have to eat?

230
00:14:15,310 --> 00:14:18,427
You mean other than the $50 worth
of sushi in my carpet?

231
00:14:18,946 --> 00:14:20,538
Yeah.

232
00:14:23,586 --> 00:14:26,623
- I don't suppose you'd eat squab.
- No.

233
00:14:27,766 --> 00:14:29,722
- Do you even know what it is?
- No.

234
00:14:29,982 --> 00:14:33,941
But it sounds pretty creepy. "Squab."

235
00:14:34,329 --> 00:14:36,638
Well, what would you eat?

236
00:14:36,921 --> 00:14:40,038
Pretty much anything,
except sushi and squab.

237
00:14:40,349 --> 00:14:41,828
Squab, squab.

238
00:14:42,063 --> 00:14:44,133
Squab, squab, squab,
squab, squab, squab...

239
00:14:44,403 --> 00:14:46,871
- Stop it.
- Sorry.

240
00:14:47,915 --> 00:14:49,553
Squab.

241
00:14:53,349 --> 00:14:54,987
Would you eat spaghetti?

242
00:14:55,272 --> 00:14:57,069
- I love spaghetti.
- Great.

243
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:59,880
Would you prefer vermicelli or linguine?

244
00:15:00,748 --> 00:15:02,500
Spaghetti.

245
00:15:03,758 --> 00:15:07,228
All right. What would you like on it?

246
00:15:07,561 --> 00:15:12,191
Puttanesca, Bolognese, Milanese,
olive oil with truffles?

247
00:15:12,996 --> 00:15:14,827
How about squab?

248
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,711
I'm just kidding. Ketchup.

249
00:15:19,517 --> 00:15:21,792
- Of course.
- And sliced-up hot dogs.

250
00:15:22,610 --> 00:15:25,761
Unbelievable.
My grandson is a hillbilly.

251
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:35,218
You know, I'm thinking we should
move this party over to my place.

252
00:15:35,610 --> 00:15:37,566
But we've been playing
volleyball all day.

253
00:15:37,826 --> 00:15:39,305
We're all sweaty and sticky.

254
00:15:39,916 --> 00:15:42,749
No problem.
Mi shower es su shower.

255
00:15:43,553 --> 00:15:47,068
- What?
- I have a shower.

256
00:15:48,694 --> 00:15:51,766
- Good. You live alone?
- Pretty much.

257
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:55,629
My brother stays with me and he's got
a kid, but he's at his grandmother's.

258
00:15:56,009 --> 00:15:58,045
Oh, that is so sweet.

259
00:15:58,350 --> 00:16:00,022
Yeah, well, we're sweet people.

260
00:16:01,402 --> 00:16:04,792
I was raised by my grandma.
I called her Nana.

261
00:16:05,666 --> 00:16:07,384
- Is that so?
- Yeah.

262
00:16:07,630 --> 00:16:10,747
I was raised by my grandma.
I called her Nana.

263
00:16:13,859 --> 00:16:16,931
Oh, yeah.
She was a big influence on me.

264
00:16:17,245 --> 00:16:20,123
She raised me. I called her Nana.

265
00:16:24,978 --> 00:16:28,129
Oh, Jake, what have we done to you?

266
00:16:29,409 --> 00:16:32,606
Dinner, such as it is, is served.

267
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:36,276
Jake? Where are you?
Come into the dining room!

268
00:16:37,142 --> 00:16:39,212
Squab!

269
00:16:53,027 --> 00:16:56,144
Alan. Alan, I'm worried about the kid.

270
00:16:56,831 --> 00:16:58,628
What kid?

271
00:16:59,924 --> 00:17:02,916
Your kid. Our kid. I think we should
go to Mom's and get him.

272
00:17:03,226 --> 00:17:06,423
Oh, come on, he's fine.
And it's just for one night.

273
00:17:06,737 --> 00:17:10,207
Which, by the way, is rapidly becoming
one of the best nights of my life.

274
00:17:12,130 --> 00:17:15,361
And grind, and grind.
And step and step and turn.

275
00:17:15,683 --> 00:17:17,833
Alan. Alan, please.

276
00:17:18,149 --> 00:17:20,060
Hey, if you're worried,
why don't you call.

277
00:17:20,323 --> 00:17:23,952
And grind, and grind.
And grind and grind and grind.

278
00:17:24,336 --> 00:17:27,055
- What's her number?
- You don't have her on speed dial?

279
00:17:27,387 --> 00:17:30,902
Hey, if I can't eat it, bang it
or bet on it, it's not in my phone.

280
00:17:33,532 --> 00:17:35,250
It's ringing.

281
00:17:35,539 --> 00:17:39,771
And grind, and grind.
And I'm a lucky boy.

282
00:17:41,683 --> 00:17:43,036
Hello? Mom?

283
00:17:43,314 --> 00:17:45,430
I can't talk to you now, Charlie.

284
00:17:45,696 --> 00:17:48,847
Get that out of your mouth.
Are you an animal?

285
00:17:49,751 --> 00:17:52,424
Mom? Hello? Hello?

286
00:17:52,761 --> 00:17:57,073
And grind, and grind.
And step and step and...

287
00:18:00,034 --> 00:18:01,433
You don't understand, Charlie.

288
00:18:01,706 --> 00:18:05,665
It was a women's volleyball team
and I could've been the volleyball.

289
00:18:06,054 --> 00:18:09,569
- Get your priorities straight, will you?
- I've got my priorities straight.

290
00:18:09,941 --> 00:18:13,013
I've had a kid for 11 years,
but I've never had group sex.

291
00:18:13,871 --> 00:18:16,749
Alan, you didn't miss anything.
It's an overrated male fantasy.

292
00:18:17,089 --> 00:18:20,047
- Really?
- No, are you kidding?

293
00:18:26,327 --> 00:18:28,238
He'd better be scarred for life.

294
00:18:33,350 --> 00:18:36,467
- Mom?
- Oh, hello, boys.

295
00:18:37,405 --> 00:18:39,316
What happened? Where's Jake?

296
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:40,939
I sent him up to take a bath.

297
00:18:41,167 --> 00:18:43,317
He had hot dogs
and spaghetti in his hair.

298
00:18:44,804 --> 00:18:47,682
Why would he have hot dogs
and spaghetti in his hair?

299
00:18:48,022 --> 00:18:50,252
Because he wouldn't eat squab.

300
00:18:52,286 --> 00:18:54,083
Squab.

301
00:18:55,003 --> 00:18:58,234
- What are you guys doing here?
- We wanted to see how things were.

302
00:18:58,974 --> 00:19:01,568
- They're okay.
- See, he's fine.

303
00:19:01,859 --> 00:19:04,168
- Let's go back to the bar.
- And take me with you.

304
00:19:10,637 --> 00:19:12,867
- Jake?
- Yeah?

305
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:19,129
Did you turn the water off
in the bathtub?

306
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:36,070
- Say goodbye to Grandma.
- Goodbye, Grandma.

307
00:19:36,387 --> 00:19:37,866
Night, Mom.

308
00:19:43,535 --> 00:19:48,086
You realize that in one night,
he did what we couldn't do in a lifetime.

309
00:19:49,053 --> 00:19:50,930
He broke her.

310
00:19:51,561 --> 00:19:54,598
He chewed her up and spit her out.

311
00:19:54,947 --> 00:19:57,063
It was a beautiful thing.

312
00:19:57,914 --> 00:19:59,586
I'm gonna be truthful here, Alan.

313
00:19:59,837 --> 00:20:02,556
I always thought your kid
was a little bit of a simpleton.

314
00:20:04,143 --> 00:20:05,462
Me too.

315
00:20:05,731 --> 00:20:09,360
But clearly, he is the chosen one.

316
00:20:10,497 --> 00:20:11,771
Hey, guys, check it out.

317
00:20:12,002 --> 00:20:13,071
Pull my finger.

318
00:20:13,297 --> 00:20:14,810
Okay.

319
00:20:18,230 --> 00:20:20,949
And they shall call him Jake.
