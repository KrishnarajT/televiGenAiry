1
00:00:02,981 --> 00:00:04,694
- Hey, buddy.
- Hi, Uncle Charlie.

2
00:00:04,863 --> 00:00:07,790
- Ready for a fun weekend?
- He's not gonna have a fun weekend.

3
00:00:07,959 --> 00:00:10,719
Charlie, he's gonna study
for a history test on Monday.

4
00:00:11,054 --> 00:00:14,648
Well, if believing that gets you back
in your car, I'll play along.

5
00:00:15,656 --> 00:00:17,488
- Where's Alan?
- He's not here.

6
00:00:17,664 --> 00:00:19,461
Really? I told him I was on my way.

7
00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:21,593
That might be why he's not here.

8
00:00:21,763 --> 00:00:24,309
Okay, I'll just have to go
over everything with you.

9
00:00:24,482 --> 00:00:26,029
I'm gonna visit my parents.

10
00:00:26,198 --> 00:00:29,624
I won't pick Jake up till Wednesday.
Alan has to take him to school.

11
00:00:29,795 --> 00:00:31,127
Monday is soccer practice.

12
00:00:31,301 --> 00:00:34,144
He has his math tutor
and his guitar teacher on Tuesday...

13
00:00:34,313 --> 00:00:35,431
Hang on. Hang on.

14
00:00:45,775 --> 00:00:47,738
Oh, hi, Judith.

15
00:00:47,908 --> 00:00:50,157
Alan, why are you avoiding me?

16
00:00:50,334 --> 00:00:55,010
- I'm not avoiding you as much as...
- Hiding.

17
00:00:55,898 --> 00:00:57,943
- Thank you.
- Why were you hiding?

18
00:00:58,115 --> 00:01:01,708
Why does the wounded gazelle
hide from the stealthy jaguar?

19
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:06,186
Why does the helpless piglet
hide from ravenous wolverine?

20
00:01:08,824 --> 00:01:10,073
Animal Planet.

21
00:01:11,501 --> 00:01:13,630
You learn a lot.

22
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:16,599
We need to talk
about your pain-in-the-ass mother.

23
00:01:16,772 --> 00:01:18,187
You know, I would love to...

24
00:01:18,361 --> 00:01:22,157
but as Charlie told you, I'm not here.
- I let her take Jake out to dinner.

25
00:01:22,335 --> 00:01:26,214
She brought him home and she lectured
me for 15 minutes about his dirty ears.

26
00:01:26,393 --> 00:01:29,522
- Fifteen minutes, huh?
- How long is this gonna take?

27
00:01:29,698 --> 00:01:30,982
Like I'm a bad parent.

28
00:01:31,162 --> 00:01:34,291
Let her try and get a Q-Tip
in a squirming 11 -year-old boy's ear.

29
00:01:34,467 --> 00:01:37,762
Mom didn't believe in Q-Tips.
She had a squirt gun.

30
00:01:37,939 --> 00:01:40,651
You know, the woolly meerkat
of western Africa...

31
00:01:40,825 --> 00:01:44,085
buries her cubs up to their necks
and licks their ears clean.

32
00:01:45,636 --> 00:01:47,718
What? It seemed apropos.

33
00:01:47,894 --> 00:01:50,475
If she wants to spend time
with her grandson...

34
00:01:50,655 --> 00:01:52,987
she needs to back off.
- Okay, I'll tell her.

35
00:01:53,165 --> 00:01:56,211
- Thank you.
- I'll tell Alan you stopped by.

36
00:02:05,004 --> 00:02:08,882
Okay, Lewis and Clark explored what?

37
00:02:09,061 --> 00:02:11,690
- I don't remember.
- You just read that chapter.

38
00:02:11,864 --> 00:02:15,077
Yeah, but Lewis and Clark
was a long time ago.

39
00:02:16,465 --> 00:02:18,964
Thanks for the ride, Sally.

40
00:02:19,561 --> 00:02:22,737
And for getting me home too.

41
00:02:24,121 --> 00:02:27,297
- Why is that funny?
- It's not.

42
00:02:27,467 --> 00:02:30,596
Mustang Sally, giddyup.

43
00:02:32,194 --> 00:02:34,109
Now, Lewis and Clark.

44
00:02:34,286 --> 00:02:36,499
Face it, Dad,
I'm just not good at history.

45
00:02:36,670 --> 00:02:38,835
Really? What did you have
for lunch yesterday?

46
00:02:39,724 --> 00:02:42,983
A pizza square. Actually, two
pizza squares, a ice cream sandwich...

47
00:02:43,154 --> 00:02:46,080
and a bag of Skittles.
- Okay, see, that's history.

48
00:02:46,249 --> 00:02:48,379
And a Ding Dong and a diet root beer.

49
00:02:48,969 --> 00:02:50,848
- Great.
- Wait. It wasn't a Ding Dong.

50
00:02:51,018 --> 00:02:52,815
- It was a Ho Ho.
- Got it.

51
00:02:54,825 --> 00:02:58,501
You know what I like?
Those big, pink things with coconut.

52
00:02:58,673 --> 00:03:02,552
- Snow Balls?
- Exactly. Can you still get those?

53
00:03:02,731 --> 00:03:05,657
Yeah, but not at the supermarket.
You have to go to 7-Eleven.

54
00:03:05,827 --> 00:03:07,872
Thank you.

55
00:03:08,044 --> 00:03:10,721
Alan, will you drive me to 7-Eleven?

56
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:14,058
No, we are trying to study.

57
00:03:14,235 --> 00:03:15,864
All right, I'll hoof it.

58
00:03:16,996 --> 00:03:19,160
- Can I bring you back something?
- Ding Dong.

59
00:03:19,338 --> 00:03:21,301
Who's there?

60
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:23,601
I'm trying to get him ready for his test.

61
00:03:23,772 --> 00:03:28,864
Sorry. Sorry. You go ahead.
I'll pretend I'm not here.

62
00:03:29,796 --> 00:03:33,853
Okay, Lewis and Clark explored what?

63
00:03:34,021 --> 00:03:35,400
Louisiana Purchase.

64
00:03:38,037 --> 00:03:39,666
- Right.
- I knew that.

65
00:03:39,836 --> 00:03:41,918
Yeah, but Uncle Charlie buzzed first.

66
00:03:42,095 --> 00:03:44,427
And I'm still buzzed.

67
00:03:46,487 --> 00:03:49,532
- Okay, give me another question.
- All right.

68
00:03:49,708 --> 00:03:52,634
Seward's Folly
is another name for?

69
00:03:52,803 --> 00:03:54,136
- Jake?
- Alaska.

70
00:03:54,309 --> 00:03:59,069
- Very good.
- Oh, I was gonna say Mrs. Seward.

71
00:04:01,421 --> 00:04:03,134
Okay, the score is 1 to 1.

72
00:04:03,303 --> 00:04:04,766
Now that you mention it...

73
00:04:04,935 --> 00:04:07,647
an Eskimo Pie would go down
pretty good right now.

74
00:04:08,448 --> 00:04:10,245
Alan, will you drive me to 7-Eleven?

75
00:04:12,046 --> 00:04:13,545
No, next question:

76
00:04:13,719 --> 00:04:16,682
- The War of 1812...
- 1812.

77
00:04:18,404 --> 00:04:21,117
- No.
- 1813.

78
00:04:21,751 --> 00:04:23,083
Let me finish the question.

79
00:04:23,257 --> 00:04:25,934
The War of 1812 was fought
against whom?

80
00:04:26,101 --> 00:04:28,481
- The British.
- Very good, 2 to 1, Jake.

81
00:04:28,653 --> 00:04:31,996
- Yes.
- No fair. My buzzer's broken.

82
00:04:33,129 --> 00:04:36,472
- Next question.
- Let me try yours.

83
00:04:38,149 --> 00:04:40,112
See? His works.

84
00:04:44,675 --> 00:04:47,054
All right, contestants,
we are at the final round.

85
00:04:47,226 --> 00:04:48,606
The questions are worth more.

86
00:04:48,774 --> 00:04:51,618
- And the answers are harder.
- True.

87
00:04:53,878 --> 00:04:57,553
- Wait for a question.
- Okay.

88
00:04:57,726 --> 00:05:01,069
Here we go. Name three changes
in American life...

89
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:03,405
brought about
by the industrial revolution.

90
00:05:04,419 --> 00:05:09,809
Populations shift to cities, employment
moving from farms to factories, and...

91
00:05:11,238 --> 00:05:14,367
- Yes?
- Sorry, I hit it by mistake.

92
00:05:16,843 --> 00:05:18,758
- Settlement of the West.
- That's correct.

93
00:05:18,935 --> 00:05:21,147
- You are our new champion.
- Yes.

94
00:05:21,319 --> 00:05:23,698
Settlement of the West.

95
00:05:23,871 --> 00:05:27,547
- You see, Jake? You know this stuff.
- Yeah, I guess I do.

96
00:05:27,719 --> 00:05:31,098
- Trust me, you are gonna do great.
- Yeah, thanks, Dad.

97
00:05:31,275 --> 00:05:33,238
You're welcome.
Now go get ready for bed.

98
00:05:33,408 --> 00:05:37,418
- I'll be there in a minute to tuck you in.
- Okey-dokey.

99
00:05:44,828 --> 00:05:48,124
Oh, I gotta get a security camera.

100
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:50,465
Where's your brother?
I wanna talk to him.

101
00:05:50,643 --> 00:05:53,403
- He's not here.
- Oh, really?

102
00:05:53,571 --> 00:05:56,616
No, he's actually not here.

103
00:05:56,792 --> 00:05:58,624
You know what his ex-wife
said to me?

104
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,799
Mom, please go away.

105
00:06:00,975 --> 00:06:03,771
She never calls me "Mom,"
but that was the gist of it.

106
00:06:04,322 --> 00:06:05,606
I took Jake out to dinner...

107
00:06:05,786 --> 00:06:08,081
- You're pretending not to understand me.
- Right.

108
00:06:08,254 --> 00:06:10,835
And all I did was suggest to Judith...

109
00:06:11,015 --> 00:06:15,107
that she might wanna pay a little more
attention to her son's ear hygiene.

110
00:06:15,282 --> 00:06:17,745
Not only was she completely
unappreciative...

111
00:06:17,917 --> 00:06:21,296
but she had the nerve to denigrate
how I raised my sons.

112
00:06:21,473 --> 00:06:24,732
Yeah, because we turned out so well.

113
00:06:24,903 --> 00:06:28,829
Excuse me, but whatever
emotional issues you think you have...

114
00:06:29,002 --> 00:06:31,965
I kept your ears spotless.

115
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:34,269
I remember.
You used the same Super Soaker...

116
00:06:34,441 --> 00:06:36,689
to keep us off the furniture.

117
00:06:36,867 --> 00:06:38,663
Ladies and gentlemen...

118
00:06:38,833 --> 00:06:44,473
presenting noted scholar
and A-student, Jake Harper.

119
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:48,369
- You got an A?
- I got an A.

120
00:06:48,538 --> 00:06:51,797
- All right. Way to go.
- Congratulations, Jake.

121
00:06:51,968 --> 00:06:56,774
- Thanks. It's my first A this year.
- Really? Well, it's none too soon then.

122
00:06:56,946 --> 00:06:59,194
- Mom, leave it alone.
- I'm not saying anything.

123
00:06:59,372 --> 00:07:02,417
I think it's wonderful.
Did anybody else in your class get an A?

124
00:07:02,593 --> 00:07:04,175
Almost everybody. Why?

125
00:07:04,350 --> 00:07:06,848
Oh, I was just curious
as to how hard the test was.

126
00:07:07,027 --> 00:07:08,824
It doesn't matter, Mom.
Still an A.

127
00:07:08,993 --> 00:07:12,503
An A is very nice. I just don't know
why you're making such a big fuss...

128
00:07:12,675 --> 00:07:16,101
if they're just handing them out
like rubella vaccinations.

129
00:07:16,272 --> 00:07:18,770
I don't know.
It looks like a pretty hard test to me.

130
00:07:19,744 --> 00:07:22,123
- No, it was easy.
- That's because you studied.

131
00:07:22,296 --> 00:07:24,794
- You earned that A.
- Wendy Chow got an A-plus.

132
00:07:24,973 --> 00:07:27,221
You hear that?
Wendy Chow got an A-plus.

133
00:07:27,399 --> 00:07:29,898
Wendy Chow is a freak of nature.

134
00:07:30,076 --> 00:07:32,622
She cloned a goldfish
for the science fair.

135
00:07:32,796 --> 00:07:34,210
We can't compare Jake to her.

136
00:07:34,385 --> 00:07:37,930
Who should we compare him to then?
The paste eaters and the unibrows?

137
00:07:38,861 --> 00:07:41,955
Darling, if you set the bar
low in childhood...

138
00:07:42,124 --> 00:07:44,503
he may never reach
the heights he's capable of.

139
00:07:44,676 --> 00:07:47,685
You're condemning him
to a life of failure and mediocrity.

140
00:07:47,855 --> 00:07:51,198
Is that what you want, Jake?
A life of failure and mediocrity?

141
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:53,919
No.

142
00:07:54,799 --> 00:07:58,309
You see? He may well be sharper
than you give him credit for.

143
00:08:00,153 --> 00:08:01,986
I'm gonna go to my room.

144
00:08:02,705 --> 00:08:04,954
I am putting that A-paper
up on the fridge.

145
00:08:05,131 --> 00:08:08,593
Wow. Texas used to be
a separate country.

146
00:08:12,243 --> 00:08:14,206
Why did we change that?

147
00:08:15,171 --> 00:08:17,003
Not now, Charlie.
How dare you?

148
00:08:17,681 --> 00:08:20,226
- Excuse me?
- He worked hard on that test.

149
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:23,576
He was finally feeling good
about himself and his abilities...

150
00:08:23,746 --> 00:08:25,745
and in 30 seconds
you managed to suck...

151
00:08:25,922 --> 00:08:28,884
every bit of self-esteem out of him.
You're like a...

152
00:08:29,059 --> 00:08:31,688
- A self-esteem sucker.
- Yes, exactly.

153
00:08:32,782 --> 00:08:35,411
Alan, I was just having
a conversation with the boy.

154
00:08:35,585 --> 00:08:38,214
No. No, you don't
have conversations. You...

155
00:08:38,387 --> 00:08:40,802
Suck self-esteem.

156
00:08:42,947 --> 00:08:45,076
I would've gotten it.

157
00:08:45,248 --> 00:08:50,054
Mom, I am sorry, but I don't think
I want you around my son anymore.

158
00:08:50,686 --> 00:08:52,815
- What?
- You heard me.

159
00:08:52,987 --> 00:08:54,153
You will not do to him...

160
00:08:54,325 --> 00:08:57,335
what you did to me and Charlie.
- What did I do to you?

161
00:08:57,504 --> 00:09:00,883
What did you do? What did she...?
Charlie, tell her.

162
00:09:02,566 --> 00:09:05,742
Why tell her when we can show her?

163
00:09:10,974 --> 00:09:14,400
I see. So you're both
turning against me.

164
00:09:14,572 --> 00:09:17,534
Oh, I turned a long time ago.

165
00:09:18,546 --> 00:09:21,091
Alan's just catching up.

166
00:09:21,850 --> 00:09:25,312
All right, fine.

167
00:09:25,490 --> 00:09:28,167
If I'm not welcome here...

168
00:09:28,334 --> 00:09:29,667
I'll leave.

169
00:09:35,613 --> 00:09:38,158
My own sons are throwing me out.

170
00:09:42,139 --> 00:09:43,804
Goodbye.

171
00:09:45,067 --> 00:09:47,065
This isn't over, is it?

172
00:09:48,162 --> 00:09:50,292
No, we're screwed.

173
00:09:57,156 --> 00:09:59,238
Let me guess. Mom?

174
00:09:59,415 --> 00:10:02,508
She's been calling all morning.
I'm starting to feel guilty.

175
00:10:02,678 --> 00:10:06,473
You can't show weakness, Alan.
She'll sense it.

176
00:10:06,652 --> 00:10:09,067
Like the hooded cobra senses
the rapid heartbeat...

177
00:10:09,245 --> 00:10:10,958
of a panic-stricken kangaroo rat.

178
00:10:13,219 --> 00:10:15,432
But don't you feel
even a bit sorry for her?

179
00:10:15,604 --> 00:10:18,817
Does the mongoose feel sorry
for the wounded garden-snake?

180
00:10:20,373 --> 00:10:24,798
Does the dingo feel sorry
for the slow-crawling Australian baby?

181
00:10:27,108 --> 00:10:29,570
- You guys okay?
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

182
00:10:29,743 --> 00:10:31,456
We're fine. Why?

183
00:10:31,625 --> 00:10:35,004
Your mother just called me. She said
she's been trying to reach you...

184
00:10:35,181 --> 00:10:36,978
all morning
and she's very worried.

185
00:10:37,147 --> 00:10:39,276
- We're fine, Rose.
- We're not talking to her.

186
00:10:39,448 --> 00:10:43,790
Why? Because she tried to encourage
Jake to live up to his potential?

187
00:10:43,966 --> 00:10:46,975
That's a reason to throw her out
and slam the door in her face?

188
00:10:48,483 --> 00:10:50,898
How could you be so cruel
to your own mother?

189
00:10:52,625 --> 00:10:56,420
And the dingo has found
another Australian baby.

190
00:10:58,147 --> 00:11:00,026
Rose, that's not what happened.

191
00:11:00,196 --> 00:11:01,576
We were protecting Jake.

192
00:11:01,744 --> 00:11:05,123
How? By ripping his only grandmother
out of his life?

193
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:09,143
- He has another grandmother.
- Oh, right, the Sacramento pill-freak.

194
00:11:09,357 --> 00:11:11,522
Is that what she told you?

195
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:13,698
For the record,
Jake's other grandmother...

196
00:11:13,875 --> 00:11:15,921
is out of rehab and doing just fine.

197
00:11:17,389 --> 00:11:21,779
We appreciate your concern, Rose.
Thanks for stopping by.

198
00:11:21,949 --> 00:11:24,328
So now you're just gonna
slam the door in my face?

199
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:26,333
Pretty much.

200
00:11:29,186 --> 00:11:31,600
Not as satisfying with a glass door.

201
00:11:32,490 --> 00:11:34,655
Okay, first she starts
with the phone calls...

202
00:11:34,833 --> 00:11:37,165
then she sent Rose over.
I wonder what's next.

203
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:40,020
I don't know, but I'm betting
it'll be something big.

204
00:11:43,994 --> 00:11:47,504
Right. I understand, it's terrible.

205
00:11:47,675 --> 00:11:50,851
Okay, let me see
what I can do about it.

206
00:11:51,022 --> 00:11:53,948
How in the hell did your mother
get my cell phone number?

207
00:11:59,681 --> 00:12:01,679
Sometimes,
when the nest is threatened...

208
00:12:01,856 --> 00:12:06,532
the seemingly docile creatures have
been known to eat their own young.

209
00:12:06,708 --> 00:12:09,884
Hey, did Mom call you
at the office today?

210
00:12:10,055 --> 00:12:11,518
No, she call here?

211
00:12:11,686 --> 00:12:16,362
- No, it's been pretty quiet.
- Yeah, maybe too quiet.

212
00:12:17,124 --> 00:12:19,254
And here we see
the female praying-mantis...

213
00:12:19,425 --> 00:12:22,970
after copulation,
devouring her mate.

214
00:12:23,148 --> 00:12:26,408
Your ex-wife back from her parents'?

215
00:12:26,578 --> 00:12:29,124
Yeah, I dropped Jake off
with her this afternoon.

216
00:12:29,297 --> 00:12:31,927
Apparently her mom had
a little relapse with the pills.

217
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:33,979
- Oh, yeah?
- They found her in pajamas...

218
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:38,456
driving an imaginary car through the
home and garden section of Wal-Mart.

219
00:12:38,877 --> 00:12:41,554
How could they tell
if she was driving an imaginary car?

220
00:12:41,721 --> 00:12:44,934
She rolled down the window
to ask for directions to the pharmacy.

221
00:12:50,297 --> 00:12:53,390
- Here we witness the...
- Not Mom.

222
00:12:53,769 --> 00:12:57,029
Hello? Yeah, this is Charlie Harper.

223
00:12:57,199 --> 00:13:00,078
What? I see.

224
00:13:00,253 --> 00:13:02,085
Okay, then.
Thanks for letting me know.

225
00:13:03,014 --> 00:13:05,346
- Who was that?
- St. John's Hospital.

226
00:13:05,524 --> 00:13:09,449
Our mother checked in this evening with
chest pains and breathing difficulties.

227
00:13:09,623 --> 00:13:12,086
- Oh, my God.
- Ever wonder who was the first guy...

228
00:13:12,258 --> 00:13:14,721
to put pineapple on pizza?

229
00:13:16,734 --> 00:13:18,899
I bet he was gay.

230
00:13:20,457 --> 00:13:22,706
- Charlie...
- No straight guy is gonna say:

231
00:13:22,884 --> 00:13:25,810
"You know what this pizza could use?
A pineapple ring."

232
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:30,115
God bless him. It's good.

233
00:13:30,288 --> 00:13:31,786
Charlie, is Mom okay?

234
00:13:31,961 --> 00:13:33,876
Of course she's okay. She's faking.

235
00:13:34,053 --> 00:13:37,146
- How can you be so sure?
- It really doesn't make any difference.

236
00:13:38,445 --> 00:13:41,574
If she is faking and
we rush to see her, she wins.

237
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:43,664
If she's not faking,
and we ignore her...

238
00:13:43,841 --> 00:13:46,256
she complains
about what horrible sons we are...

239
00:13:46,435 --> 00:13:47,850
and she still wins.

240
00:13:48,024 --> 00:13:50,702
What if she's not faking and she dies?

241
00:13:51,622 --> 00:13:54,335
Well, look at you, Mr. Glass Half-Full.

242
00:13:56,893 --> 00:13:58,975
I can't help thinking this is all my fault.

243
00:13:59,152 --> 00:14:02,495
I told Mom she couldn't see
her grandson and she had a heart attack.

244
00:14:02,665 --> 00:14:04,830
Alan, you forget
who you're dealing with.

245
00:14:05,008 --> 00:14:07,637
This woman buried two husbands
and divorced two others.

246
00:14:07,811 --> 00:14:09,940
She's lived through wars,
riots, earthquakes.

247
00:14:10,111 --> 00:14:14,287
Only way you're gonna bring her down
is with a stake dipped in holy water.

248
00:14:15,842 --> 00:14:17,507
Here we are.

249
00:14:20,695 --> 00:14:23,990
Oh, my God. Mommy?

250
00:14:24,167 --> 00:14:25,499
Excuse me?

251
00:14:25,673 --> 00:14:27,718
- Are you family?
- Yeah, we're her sons.

252
00:14:27,890 --> 00:14:30,388
Is she gonna be okay?
Tell me she's gonna be okay.

253
00:14:30,567 --> 00:14:33,780
Your mother's gonna be fine.
I can't find a thing wrong with her.

254
00:14:33,955 --> 00:14:35,752
- Are you sure?
- As sure as I can be.

255
00:14:35,921 --> 00:14:37,586
Her heart's fine. Lungs are fine.

256
00:14:37,762 --> 00:14:39,725
Blood chemistry's good. EEG's normal.

257
00:14:39,895 --> 00:14:43,024
- Oh, thank God.
- That bitch.

258
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:45,584
Yeah, tell me about it.

259
00:14:46,798 --> 00:14:49,093
Excuse me.
I'm gonna tell her she can go home.

260
00:14:49,266 --> 00:14:52,478
- Oh, no, please, let us.
- Yeah, we owe her that.

261
00:14:52,654 --> 00:14:55,331
Suit yourself.
Oh, better hurry, though.

262
00:14:55,499 --> 00:14:58,044
The nurses are circulating
a'do not revive" petition.

263
00:14:59,514 --> 00:15:02,976
- You said there was nothing wrong.
- It's a big hospital.

264
00:15:03,154 --> 00:15:04,902
Things happen.

265
00:15:07,672 --> 00:15:09,051
What do we do now?

266
00:15:09,219 --> 00:15:12,348
Don't worry. I got a plan.

267
00:15:12,524 --> 00:15:14,237
Oh, great, he has a plan.

268
00:15:18,297 --> 00:15:19,629
Mom?

269
00:15:20,430 --> 00:15:23,226
Charlie? Is that you?

270
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:25,113
Alan's here too, Mom.

271
00:15:25,283 --> 00:15:29,339
- Hi, Mom.
- Boys, you didn't have to come.

272
00:15:30,219 --> 00:15:32,015
Are you kidding? Of course we did.

273
00:15:32,185 --> 00:15:34,683
- Right, Alan?
- Of course.

274
00:15:34,862 --> 00:15:35,980
Tell us what happened.

275
00:15:37,205 --> 00:15:41,214
I came home this afternoon, alone.

276
00:15:42,141 --> 00:15:45,436
I was walking up the stairs...

277
00:15:45,947 --> 00:15:47,660
alone.

278
00:15:49,587 --> 00:15:52,716
And I had trouble breathing...

279
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:56,981
so I drove myself to the hospital...

280
00:15:57,869 --> 00:15:59,202
alone.

281
00:16:02,596 --> 00:16:05,642
- Well, why did you drive yourself?
- Oh, I didn't wanna bother...

282
00:16:05,817 --> 00:16:08,066
the ambulance people.

283
00:16:09,624 --> 00:16:10,707
Why didn't you call us?

284
00:16:12,427 --> 00:16:18,317
Oh, you both made it very clear
how you feel about me.

285
00:16:18,492 --> 00:16:19,991
Now, that's not fair.

286
00:16:20,166 --> 00:16:22,878
Just tell Jake...

287
00:16:23,052 --> 00:16:26,312
his Grandmommy loves him
very much.

288
00:16:26,482 --> 00:16:27,897
Don't talk like that.

289
00:16:28,072 --> 00:16:30,701
You can tell him yourself,
after the operation.

290
00:16:30,875 --> 00:16:32,290
What operation?

291
00:16:36,647 --> 00:16:39,991
Relax. Relax. Quadruple bypasses
are routine these days.

292
00:16:40,161 --> 00:16:41,790
- Quadruple?
- Yeah, yeah.

293
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:44,886
You got four clogged arteries.
Right, Alan?

294
00:16:45,055 --> 00:16:48,399
Right, the doctor said it's lucky
you came when you did.

295
00:16:48,569 --> 00:16:52,364
Another few days and you'd have been
flopping around on the floor like a carp.

296
00:16:53,254 --> 00:16:55,634
It's no big deal, Mom.
They crack open you open...

297
00:16:55,806 --> 00:16:58,935
flush out the pipes, sew you back up
and you're good as new.

298
00:16:59,111 --> 00:17:02,204
Except, you know, for the big,
gnarly scar on your chest.

299
00:17:02,374 --> 00:17:04,003
They're prepping the OR.

300
00:17:04,172 --> 00:17:06,218
We got the best surgeon available.

301
00:17:06,390 --> 00:17:07,722
He's young but really sharp.

302
00:17:07,895 --> 00:17:09,728
And well-respected in his own country.

303
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:18,477
Well, all right.

304
00:17:18,813 --> 00:17:22,525
If it has to be done, it has to be done.

305
00:17:30,610 --> 00:17:32,525
I love you, boys.

306
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:38,304
If the worst should happen...

307
00:17:39,144 --> 00:17:41,107
please remember that.

308
00:17:42,490 --> 00:17:45,119
- Yeah. Sure.
- Of course.

309
00:17:45,669 --> 00:17:47,584
Oh, my God, Evelyn
Are you all right?

310
00:17:47,761 --> 00:17:51,472
Oh, Judith, is that you?

311
00:17:52,028 --> 00:17:53,991
Yes, I'm right here. Jake's here too.

312
00:17:54,161 --> 00:17:56,957
Oh, Jake.
Come to Grandmommy, darling.

313
00:17:57,131 --> 00:17:58,761
I'm sorry you feel bad, Grandma.

314
00:17:58,930 --> 00:18:03,236
Oh, Grandmommy's feeling much better
now that her little man is here.

315
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:08,709
- I made you a get-well card.
- Oh, isn't that nice.

316
00:18:08,886 --> 00:18:10,384
Gift shop wasn't open?

317
00:18:13,655 --> 00:18:17,116
You said you had a plan.
Well, guess what? It was a bad plan.

318
00:18:17,294 --> 00:18:19,459
- Alan, calm down.
- The plan sucked.

319
00:18:20,348 --> 00:18:21,680
- Don't worry.
- Don't worry?

320
00:18:21,854 --> 00:18:24,983
She's expecting a quadruple bypass.
What are we gonna do?

321
00:18:25,158 --> 00:18:26,907
We're gonna get her one.

322
00:18:27,083 --> 00:18:29,842
Must be someone around here
who can handle a rib spreader.

323
00:18:30,011 --> 00:18:31,843
- Charlie, that's insane.
- You're right.

324
00:18:32,019 --> 00:18:34,398
There's no time. Better scrub up.

325
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:38,458
She had to drive herself to the hospital?
What is wrong with you two?

326
00:18:38,628 --> 00:18:41,305
- Relax, Judith. She's not sick.
- What?

327
00:18:41,473 --> 00:18:44,649
She's faking and we called her bluff,
and then she called ours.

328
00:18:44,819 --> 00:18:47,282
So now, we're gonna
have to cut her open.

329
00:18:47,789 --> 00:18:49,419
You want in?

330
00:18:50,174 --> 00:18:52,303
Hey, guess what?
After Grandma's operation...

331
00:18:52,474 --> 00:18:54,806
she's gonna take me
to Magic Mountain, okay?

332
00:18:54,984 --> 00:18:57,910
Yeah, yeah, that's okay.
We're gonna have to tell her.

333
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:59,995
You sure?
We don't need to do the bypass.

334
00:19:00,171 --> 00:19:02,086
All we do is put her out,
slice her open.

335
00:19:02,263 --> 00:19:05,392
- The scar will sell it.
- The truth, Charlie.

336
00:19:08,287 --> 00:19:10,369
Doesn't have to be a big scar.

337
00:19:10,546 --> 00:19:13,258
Okay, doctor, let's schedule
this as quickly as possible.

338
00:19:13,432 --> 00:19:16,061
Oh, great. I'll be here.

339
00:19:16,235 --> 00:19:18,114
Hello, boys.

340
00:19:18,954 --> 00:19:22,047
- What are you doing?
- Lf I'm going to have to have surgery...

341
00:19:22,217 --> 00:19:23,631
I want my own doctor.

342
00:19:23,806 --> 00:19:26,221
Mom, you don't really need a surgeon.

343
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,898
Oh, but I do.

344
00:19:29,077 --> 00:19:31,872
Your quadruple bypass story
makes the perfect cover...

345
00:19:32,047 --> 00:19:33,844
for a little nip tuck.

346
00:19:34,013 --> 00:19:36,392
No turkey neck for Grandmommy, right?

347
00:19:37,903 --> 00:19:40,581
About Jake. I told him
I'd take him to Magic Mountain...

348
00:19:40,748 --> 00:19:43,246
but you know
how I feel about direct sunlight.

349
00:19:44,304 --> 00:19:46,516
Yeah, and wolfbane.

350
00:19:47,315 --> 00:19:49,648
You'll take him for me,
won't you, Charlie?

351
00:19:49,825 --> 00:19:51,622
- Sure, Mom.
- I'll make it up to him...

352
00:19:51,791 --> 00:19:55,337
by taking him out for a haircut
and some decent clothes.

353
00:19:55,514 --> 00:19:58,358
- He'll like that.
- Sure, Mom.

354
00:19:58,526 --> 00:20:01,025
Maybe when his mother sees
how nice he could look...

355
00:20:01,204 --> 00:20:04,665
she'll take the hint and stop dressing
him like a tackling dummy.

356
00:20:06,014 --> 00:20:08,595
Oh, the food here is just dreadful.

357
00:20:08,775 --> 00:20:10,940
So why don't you boys
run across the street...

358
00:20:11,118 --> 00:20:12,664
and get me a nice ahi tuna...

359
00:20:12,833 --> 00:20:14,878
Charlie, what in God's name
are you doing?

360
00:20:17,141 --> 00:20:19,056
Just practicing.

361
00:20:23,583 --> 00:20:25,629
The worker bees, or drones...

362
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:29,262
live a life of utter devotion
to their queen.

363
00:20:29,733 --> 00:20:32,065
You had a plan.

364
00:20:32,619 --> 00:20:35,795
From birth, these industrious
yet mindless creatures...

365
00:20:35,966 --> 00:20:38,547
slave away to fulfill
the queen 's every need.

366
00:20:38,768 --> 00:20:42,278
"Don't worry, Alan. I have a plan."

367
00:20:43,704 --> 00:20:48,464
Until finally they reach the end
of their brief lifespan and die...

368
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:51,769
becoming food and building materials
for the rest of the hive.

369
00:20:51,945 --> 00:20:56,037
Alan, where's my sandwich?

370
00:20:56,839 --> 00:20:58,885
Coming, Mom.

371
00:20:59,935 --> 00:21:05,538
A cruel existence? Perhaps.
But that's life on the Animal Planet.
