1
00:00:03,130 --> 00:00:05,405
- What's that?
- My high school yearbook.

2
00:00:05,683 --> 00:00:08,402
Hey, do you remember a
girl named Jamie Eckelberry?

3
00:00:08,695 --> 00:00:10,367
- No.
- Yeah, sure you do.

4
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:12,736
She used to hang out
at the house all the time.

5
00:00:13,006 --> 00:00:16,123
Oh, yeah. Eckelberry Hound.

6
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:19,499
Not a name she was fond of.

7
00:00:19,826 --> 00:00:24,377
Hey, I didn't make it up.
I just spread it around. What about her?

8
00:00:24,764 --> 00:00:27,836
Oh, she called the alumni association
and tracked me down.

9
00:00:28,154 --> 00:00:31,863
How does that work? They let her
sniff one of your sweaters?

10
00:00:32,254 --> 00:00:35,803
She e-mailed me. She's in town
on business, and I invited her over.

11
00:00:36,188 --> 00:00:40,147
Great. I'll get out of your way.
Just keep her off the good rug.

12
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:43,930
Very funny. No. For your
information, it's not a date.

13
00:00:44,264 --> 00:00:47,176
She's just a friend who has become
very successful in her field.

14
00:00:47,528 --> 00:00:51,521
Oh, that's nice that she
has a field to run around in.

15
00:00:52,968 --> 00:00:56,517
- It's getting old, Charlie.
- In people years or dog years?

16
00:00:57,989 --> 00:01:00,787
Sorry. Oh, look.
You remember Miss Hanrahan?

17
00:01:01,128 --> 00:01:05,201
- Sure. I had her for sophomore English.
- I had her in the teachers' lounge.

18
00:01:07,112 --> 00:01:09,501
Oh, that's Jamie. Be nice.

19
00:01:09,832 --> 00:01:12,744
I'm always nice. Ask Miss Hanrahan.

20
00:01:14,058 --> 00:01:16,288
- I'm serious.
- Relax. I'm just gonna say hello...

21
00:01:16,569 --> 00:01:19,129
scratch her behind the ear,
and then I'm out of here.

22
00:01:21,213 --> 00:01:23,010
- You done with the dog jokes?
- Yes.

23
00:01:23,306 --> 00:01:26,343
- Good.
- I hope she looks fetching.

24
00:01:28,578 --> 00:01:31,695
Okay, I guess I had one more.

25
00:01:33,934 --> 00:01:35,890
- Alan.
- Jamie.

26
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:09,178
Do you remember how Stuart Negelman
used to tell everybody you were gay?

27
00:02:09,587 --> 00:02:11,782
Don't remind me.
I had one Boy George album...

28
00:02:12,056 --> 00:02:14,889
and suddenly
I'm queen of the fairies.

29
00:02:15,236 --> 00:02:17,625
You'll be happy to know
I ran into him in New York.

30
00:02:17,914 --> 00:02:21,111
- And? Knew it.
- Gay.

31
00:02:21,596 --> 00:02:23,712
Okay, here we go.

32
00:02:23,982 --> 00:02:27,691
Two margaritas,
and a rum and Diet Coke.

33
00:02:28,041 --> 00:02:30,111
- Thank you, Charlie.
- You're welcome.

34
00:02:31,221 --> 00:02:33,177
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

35
00:02:36,661 --> 00:02:41,212
So Stuart Negelman: Buttoned-down,
or singing show tunes on a float?

36
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:44,234
Very macho. Owns a gym in SoHo.

37
00:02:44,528 --> 00:02:47,042
Speaking of which, you look
like you're in good shape.

38
00:02:47,331 --> 00:02:51,006
- I have kept up with the hacky sack.
- Good for you.

39
00:02:51,348 --> 00:02:54,499
And you. I cannot get over what
a beautiful woman you've become.

40
00:02:54,863 --> 00:02:59,334
- Oh, stop it. You're embarrassing me.
- Too bad. It's true.

41
00:03:04,655 --> 00:03:08,807
Charlie, that's lovely. You still play.

42
00:03:09,216 --> 00:03:10,888
Just professionally.

43
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:15,979
- You became a musician?
- More a composer. Gotta pay the bills.

44
00:03:17,837 --> 00:03:20,874
Play the jingle you wrote for the
feminine deodorant commercial.

45
00:03:21,603 --> 00:03:23,480
Okay.

46
00:03:23,988 --> 00:03:28,937
Fresh as a summer breeze
Clean as a mountain spring

47
00:03:29,553 --> 00:03:32,750
No. You wrote that? I love that.

48
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:36,340
Hey, hey, did I tell you
that I was voted...

49
00:03:36,625 --> 00:03:39,822
Chiropractor of the Year by the San
Fernando Valley Chiropractic Association?

50
00:03:40,182 --> 00:03:42,901
Oh, that's fantastic, Alan.
You must be very proud.

51
00:03:43,237 --> 00:03:48,152
Well, it's not pride so much as the
satisfaction I get from helping people.

52
00:03:49,681 --> 00:03:52,991
Carefree, so carefree

53
00:03:53,363 --> 00:03:56,912
What every woman wants to be

54
00:03:59,808 --> 00:04:02,447
Hey. Hey, you know
what would be fun?

55
00:04:02,737 --> 00:04:05,809
A session of Dungeons & Dragons.
Like the old days, you know?

56
00:04:06,126 --> 00:04:10,085
- Just the two of us.
- Wow, I haven't played in years.

57
00:04:10,478 --> 00:04:12,753
Or we can go down to the beach
and go for a swim.

58
00:04:13,072 --> 00:04:15,950
- I didn't bring a suit.
- So my plan is working.

59
00:04:18,010 --> 00:04:21,525
You know, I think I'll take a rain check.
Do you mind if I use your restroom?

60
00:04:21,902 --> 00:04:23,381
Down the hall on the right.

61
00:04:23,618 --> 00:04:25,256
Thank you.

62
00:04:29,225 --> 00:04:31,261
Don't you have enough women?

63
00:04:31,861 --> 00:04:35,615
No. Anyway, you said she
was just an old friend.

64
00:04:36,004 --> 00:04:37,562
Well, that was before I saw her.

65
00:04:37,803 --> 00:04:40,237
Come on, I spent years
laying the groundwork for this.

66
00:04:40,565 --> 00:04:43,477
And yet you never erected
anything on the site.

67
00:04:43,829 --> 00:04:45,706
Because she didn't look like that then.

68
00:04:46,005 --> 00:04:47,802
Oh, shame on you, Alan Harper.

69
00:04:48,934 --> 00:04:51,971
Don't you know a woman is so much
more than what's on the outside?

70
00:04:52,323 --> 00:04:55,201
She's a mountain spring,
a summer breeze and I saw her first.

71
00:04:55,797 --> 00:04:57,469
What are you, 11?

72
00:04:57,763 --> 00:05:01,597
Come on. She's smart, she's beautiful,
she's the kind of woman who...

73
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:04,185
- You could never get?
- Exactly.

74
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:09,370
Well, if she's that important to you.

75
00:05:09,689 --> 00:05:11,520
She is, she is. Very much.

76
00:05:11,782 --> 00:05:13,898
- Okay, fine. I'm out of it.
- Really?

77
00:05:14,209 --> 00:05:15,688
Happy birthday.

78
00:05:15,924 --> 00:05:19,678
Isn't that presumptuous? You think you
can just give this woman as a gift?

79
00:05:20,025 --> 00:05:22,983
- Okay, forget it.
- No, no. Happy birthday to me.

80
00:05:24,251 --> 00:05:28,608
Listen, I have an early meeting in the
morning, so I should probably get going.

81
00:05:29,022 --> 00:05:32,617
Oh, no, no. The night is so young,
and Charlie was just leaving.

82
00:05:32,955 --> 00:05:35,833
Yeah, if I don't start drinking now,
I'll be up all night.

83
00:05:36,847 --> 00:05:39,645
I really have to get going.
What about dinner tomorrow night?

84
00:05:40,236 --> 00:05:42,113
- That would be great.
- Okay, terrific.

85
00:05:42,371 --> 00:05:44,327
Why don't the three of us
meet at 7?

86
00:05:44,839 --> 00:05:46,670
The... The three of us?

87
00:05:48,187 --> 00:05:50,621
Oh, gee. Tomorrow night? I can't.

88
00:05:50,949 --> 00:05:54,737
Oh, come on, Charlie.
I'm only in town for a few days.

89
00:05:55,092 --> 00:05:58,129
It wouldn't be the same
without you. Right, Alan?

90
00:05:58,439 --> 00:06:02,034
That's... That's true.
It would be different. But still good.

91
00:06:02,414 --> 00:06:05,087
No, no, no. You guys have
a lot of catching up to do.

92
00:06:05,427 --> 00:06:08,225
I insist. Charlie, you have to come.

93
00:06:08,524 --> 00:06:10,719
Well, if it's okay with Alan...

94
00:06:11,913 --> 00:06:14,143
Of course.

95
00:06:14,466 --> 00:06:18,300
Okay, great. Then I will
see you both tomorrow.

96
00:06:18,650 --> 00:06:20,003
- Okay.
- Thank you.

97
00:06:20,241 --> 00:06:22,550
- Can't wait.
- I know. Me too. Good night.

98
00:06:22,835 --> 00:06:24,268
Bye.

99
00:06:27,982 --> 00:06:31,338
So I'll get you something else
for your birthday.

100
00:06:31,706 --> 00:06:33,424
You like hookers?

101
00:06:34,217 --> 00:06:36,253
Charlie, we agreed you're out.
Now stay out.

102
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,869
- All right, fine. I won't go.
- Thank you.

103
00:06:41,707 --> 00:06:46,258
Wait! If you don't come,
she'll think I told you not to come.

104
00:06:46,687 --> 00:06:47,961
There is that possibility.

105
00:06:48,361 --> 00:06:50,921
That's your plan. To make me
look petty and insecure.

106
00:06:51,248 --> 00:06:53,557
Alan, I don't have to plan for that.

107
00:06:54,010 --> 00:06:57,764
Let me tell you something. You're coming
with us, whether you like it or not.

108
00:06:58,529 --> 00:07:00,326
All right.

109
00:07:01,249 --> 00:07:03,319
Wait!

110
00:07:04,346 --> 00:07:06,541
- We should take your new Mercedes.
- Fine.

111
00:07:06,856 --> 00:07:09,575
- I should drive it so she thinks it's mine.
- Okay.

112
00:07:11,878 --> 00:07:13,709
Wait!

113
00:07:14,012 --> 00:07:16,321
She'll never believe
I drive a Mercedes.

114
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:20,272
You'll drive my old Volvo
so that she thinks it's yours.

115
00:07:20,624 --> 00:07:25,175
Whatever. That just means you'll
be sitting in the backseat alone.

116
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:27,572
Wait!

117
00:07:28,867 --> 00:07:33,065
Charlie, I can't believe that after
all these years, you're still single.

118
00:07:33,470 --> 00:07:34,949
Well...

119
00:07:39,245 --> 00:07:40,837
It's not that hard to believe.

120
00:07:41,086 --> 00:07:45,159
I'm a selfish, promiscuous,
commitment-phobic man.

121
00:07:45,522 --> 00:07:50,118
Alan, on the other hand, is a very
generous, loyal, one-woman kind of guy.

122
00:07:52,008 --> 00:07:53,521
Guilty.

123
00:07:55,564 --> 00:07:57,998
Why doesn't that surprise me?

124
00:07:58,284 --> 00:07:59,763
Now, what is surprising...

125
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,073
is to hear a man be so honest
and forthcoming about his flaws.

126
00:08:04,729 --> 00:08:08,881
Charlie, you are
a real breath of fresh air.

127
00:08:09,290 --> 00:08:11,121
Guilty.

128
00:08:14,311 --> 00:08:18,907
But if you really want a breath
of fresh air, take a lungful of Alan.

129
00:08:22,053 --> 00:08:23,930
He is a true gentleman.

130
00:08:24,229 --> 00:08:25,947
Oh, Alan's always been a gentleman.

131
00:08:26,195 --> 00:08:29,790
I remember one time we were kids. We
were in my bedroom playing Stratego...

132
00:08:30,129 --> 00:08:33,758
and my blouse came unbuttoned,
and Alan, instead of sneaking a peek...

133
00:08:34,104 --> 00:08:39,940
like a lot of guys would do, averted
his eyes and said, "Jamie, bosom."

134
00:08:40,757 --> 00:08:42,873
Really. Is that true, Alan?

135
00:08:43,184 --> 00:08:46,813
Pretty much. We were
playing Boggle, not Stratego.

136
00:08:47,202 --> 00:08:50,797
Well, there you go.
A gentleman. A better man than I.

137
00:08:51,177 --> 00:08:55,932
Oh, don't put yourself down, Charlie.
You seem like a wonderful man to me.

138
00:08:56,617 --> 00:09:00,451
Yeah, but you heard him. I'm better.

139
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:05,976
Excuse me.

140
00:09:10,510 --> 00:09:13,229
I'll be right back.
I think he wants to talk.

141
00:09:13,564 --> 00:09:16,078
You know, you are such
a good brother.

142
00:09:16,410 --> 00:09:18,207
You have no idea.

143
00:09:23,523 --> 00:09:25,320
"Bosom"?

144
00:09:25,909 --> 00:09:27,740
Forget that.
What the hell are you doing?

145
00:09:28,001 --> 00:09:31,437
What? I'm trying to make you look
good. Turns out it's not that easy.

146
00:09:32,185 --> 00:09:34,494
You look like you're trying
to make me look good...

147
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:36,418
but you're making you look good.

148
00:09:36,663 --> 00:09:39,131
I don't know how,
but that's the net result.

149
00:09:39,425 --> 00:09:41,780
- Alan, you're being ridiculous.
- Am I? I think not.

150
00:09:42,061 --> 00:09:44,621
From the minute we walked in,
you've been sabotaging me.

151
00:09:44,948 --> 00:09:48,145
- How?
- How? Look at where I'm sitting.

152
00:09:48,505 --> 00:09:51,383
- What? You wanted to sit next to her.
- Yeah, and you let me.

153
00:09:53,066 --> 00:09:57,344
And now you get to stare into her eyes,
and I get to stare into her ear.

154
00:09:58,381 --> 00:10:00,451
What do you want from me?
Wanna change seats?

155
00:10:00,766 --> 00:10:02,324
Sure. That won't look suspicious.

156
00:10:02,565 --> 00:10:06,558
I'm just trying to help, Alan.
Well, how about that? I do have to pee.

157
00:10:09,051 --> 00:10:10,769
You wanna help me?
Stop talking me up.

158
00:10:11,018 --> 00:10:12,133
- It's killing me.
- Okay.

159
00:10:12,524 --> 00:10:14,833
Stop putting yourself down.
That's killing me too.

160
00:10:15,161 --> 00:10:17,800
- Got it.
- Just sit there and eat your dinner...

161
00:10:18,090 --> 00:10:19,364
and I'll play your game.

162
00:10:19,596 --> 00:10:20,995
Fine.

163
00:10:21,228 --> 00:10:23,025
You wanna shake on it?

164
00:10:24,869 --> 00:10:26,860
You're disgusting.

165
00:10:27,170 --> 00:10:29,286
Yeah, I'm disgusting.

166
00:10:29,555 --> 00:10:32,433
At least I'm not the one
taking a squirt on my shoe.

167
00:10:36,125 --> 00:10:39,276
Let me tell you something
about my brother.

168
00:10:39,598 --> 00:10:43,147
He puts himself down,
but he is truly a wonderful man.

169
00:10:43,490 --> 00:10:48,325
I mean, here's a guy,
single, good-Iooking, talented...

170
00:10:48,721 --> 00:10:51,793
- Well, l...
- You're too modest.

171
00:10:52,152 --> 00:10:54,985
Talented, a ton of money.

172
00:10:55,290 --> 00:10:58,760
And what does he do when his brother
and nephew need a place to live?

173
00:10:59,098 --> 00:11:02,977
Does he complain about us
cramping his style? No.

174
00:11:03,325 --> 00:11:06,920
He opens up his home, and his heart.

175
00:11:07,258 --> 00:11:09,852
And frankly, I don't know
which one is bigger.

176
00:11:12,572 --> 00:11:16,087
You are an incredible human being.

177
00:11:18,054 --> 00:11:20,363
Can we get the damn check, please?

178
00:11:24,582 --> 00:11:27,460
Wait till you meet Jake.
He's a great kid.

179
00:11:27,762 --> 00:11:29,593
You're gonna love him. Right, Charlie?

180
00:11:29,896 --> 00:11:33,525
Don't oversell him, Alan.
He mostly sits around and eats.

181
00:11:33,872 --> 00:11:35,624
What do you guys like to do together?

182
00:11:35,922 --> 00:11:39,995
Oh, we do all kinds
of father-son things.

183
00:11:40,358 --> 00:11:45,148
- We go to the movies...
- Where he sits and eats.

184
00:11:45,547 --> 00:11:48,857
And we also build models...

185
00:11:49,773 --> 00:11:53,163
You know, airplanes, and
fly them off the deck.

186
00:11:53,539 --> 00:11:56,292
- That sounds like fun.
- Oh, it is. Jake loves it.

187
00:11:56,594 --> 00:11:58,471
I mean, he is a great kid.

188
00:11:58,770 --> 00:12:01,000
I can't wait to meet him.

189
00:12:01,281 --> 00:12:03,272
How about tomorrow afternoon?

190
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:06,054
- Tomorrow sounds great.
- Good, good. It's a date.

191
00:12:06,344 --> 00:12:08,938
- So don't be late.
- Or we'll have to wait.

192
00:12:13,667 --> 00:12:15,658
Oh, okay. Here we are.

193
00:12:15,926 --> 00:12:19,680
Thank you so much.
I had a wonderful time.

194
00:12:21,492 --> 00:12:24,848
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Good night.

195
00:12:31,242 --> 00:12:33,153
Good night, Charlie.

196
00:12:37,268 --> 00:12:38,747
Good night.

197
00:12:41,243 --> 00:12:43,393
To the Batcave, Alfred.

198
00:12:44,967 --> 00:12:46,480
Go to hell.

199
00:12:46,725 --> 00:12:49,637
I was just sitting here.
I didn't put her tongue in my mouth.

200
00:12:49,947 --> 00:12:51,460
You got tongue?

201
00:12:51,746 --> 00:12:54,340
Actually, looking back,
it was probably mine.

202
00:12:55,219 --> 00:12:57,255
Oh, relax. I'm just screwing with you.

203
00:12:57,521 --> 00:12:59,352
Besides, you're the one
who got the date.

204
00:12:59,613 --> 00:13:02,207
You had to pimp your kid
out to do it, but you got there.

205
00:13:02,542 --> 00:13:05,693
Hey, hey, there is nothing wrong
with bragging on my son.

206
00:13:06,015 --> 00:13:08,848
He's a reflection of me,
and if that compensates...

207
00:13:09,154 --> 00:13:11,270
for some of my social clumsiness...

208
00:13:11,581 --> 00:13:14,175
And maybe rustles up a little tail.

209
00:13:14,468 --> 00:13:16,026
I am not pimping him out.

210
00:13:16,267 --> 00:13:19,065
Don't bark at me. I'm proud of you.

211
00:13:19,992 --> 00:13:22,904
Thank you. And make yourself
scarce tomorrow.

212
00:13:23,214 --> 00:13:26,763
- I don't need any more of your help.
- Fine. You're on your own.

213
00:13:27,105 --> 00:13:29,824
Now, hush up and drive
Miss Daisy home.

214
00:13:30,871 --> 00:13:33,624
Okay, Sky Captain. Ready to go?

215
00:13:33,926 --> 00:13:35,279
I guess.

216
00:13:35,516 --> 00:13:37,154
See how he loves this?

217
00:13:38,738 --> 00:13:40,649
Pilot to copilot. Contact.

218
00:13:41,375 --> 00:13:42,854
What?

219
00:13:44,011 --> 00:13:47,242
- Contact.
- Why are you talking like that?

220
00:13:48,698 --> 00:13:51,053
Just... Just start the engine.

221
00:13:52,045 --> 00:13:54,320
Here we go. Ready for liftoff?

222
00:13:54,598 --> 00:13:56,714
It's not a rocket ship, Dad.

223
00:13:56,983 --> 00:13:59,372
I know that, Jake.

224
00:14:02,590 --> 00:14:04,899
Hey, it actually works.

225
00:14:05,185 --> 00:14:06,903
Bring it up. Bring it up.

226
00:14:07,151 --> 00:14:09,221
- Okay.
- Come on, Jake, up, up. It's...

227
00:14:09,495 --> 00:14:10,894
- Don't yell.
- Give me that.

228
00:14:11,127 --> 00:14:12,799
- No, I'm doing it.
- Well, then do it.

229
00:14:13,093 --> 00:14:14,765
I am.

230
00:14:18,910 --> 00:14:20,707
Is that it?

231
00:14:21,714 --> 00:14:24,945
No, go get it, and we'll patch
her back up, like we always do.

232
00:14:25,312 --> 00:14:28,304
Can we just order
a pizza and watch TV?

233
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:30,173
Go get the plane.

234
00:14:31,673 --> 00:14:33,311
This sucks.

235
00:14:34,937 --> 00:14:37,849
"This sucks." Isn't he a hoot?

236
00:14:39,791 --> 00:14:41,622
He's great.

237
00:14:42,427 --> 00:14:44,657
So...

238
00:14:44,938 --> 00:14:47,168
here we are.

239
00:14:47,449 --> 00:14:49,041
Yep.

240
00:14:50,629 --> 00:14:54,383
I just cannot get over
how much you've changed.

241
00:14:55,023 --> 00:14:59,460
- You like?
- Yeah, me like. I mean... I mean, I like.

242
00:15:00,839 --> 00:15:02,158
So...

243
00:15:03,266 --> 00:15:04,984
where's Charlie?

244
00:15:06,488 --> 00:15:08,206
This is all I could find.

245
00:15:11,175 --> 00:15:13,245
- Guess who that is.
- No way.

246
00:15:13,518 --> 00:15:16,874
- Way.
- What was going on with your hair?

247
00:15:18,205 --> 00:15:19,957
It's called a Jeri curl.

248
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:23,899
It was my Michael Jackson period.

249
00:15:24,231 --> 00:15:25,949
Who's the tall guy next to you?

250
00:15:26,197 --> 00:15:28,233
Oh, that's me, Jake.

251
00:15:30,047 --> 00:15:32,322
Oh, sorry.

252
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,636
Well, at least you look like a girl now.

253
00:15:35,362 --> 00:15:37,000
Thank you.

254
00:15:37,496 --> 00:15:39,248
Was Dad your boyfriend?

255
00:15:39,504 --> 00:15:41,574
Oh, no, no.
Jamie and I were just friends.

256
00:15:41,889 --> 00:15:44,483
Yeah, we were never that way.

257
00:15:44,819 --> 00:15:46,855
Are you that way now?

258
00:15:47,999 --> 00:15:51,355
- Why don't you go watch TV?
- Finally.

259
00:15:55,615 --> 00:15:58,493
You know, Jamie, I've been thinking.

260
00:15:58,795 --> 00:16:02,105
You're single. I'm single.
Well, we have an awful lot in common.

261
00:16:02,477 --> 00:16:06,311
I mean, there's no reason
we couldn't try to be...

262
00:16:06,662 --> 00:16:09,301
you know, more than friends.

263
00:16:09,633 --> 00:16:11,351
Is that something you'd want?

264
00:16:11,641 --> 00:16:13,518
Well...

265
00:16:14,403 --> 00:16:17,918
- Hey.
- Oh, darn.

266
00:16:18,546 --> 00:16:20,980
- Sorry to intrude.
- That's okay. It's good to see you.

267
00:16:21,266 --> 00:16:22,779
I thought you were gonna be busy.

268
00:16:23,065 --> 00:16:26,216
I was. I went to a movie,
shot some pool...

269
00:16:26,538 --> 00:16:30,929
bought a book, bought a shirt, drank
a bucket of coffee, read the book.

270
00:16:31,602 --> 00:16:34,162
And then it occurred to me:
"Hey, I have a home."

271
00:16:36,330 --> 00:16:38,525
Hey, Dad, can you microwave
some popcorn for me?

272
00:16:39,134 --> 00:16:42,763
- Why can't you make it for yourself?
- Remember what happened last time?

273
00:16:43,109 --> 00:16:45,748
You're old enough to make
popcorn without starting a fire.

274
00:16:46,499 --> 00:16:48,057
Okay, I'll give it a shot.

275
00:16:51,562 --> 00:16:53,359
I'll be right back.

276
00:16:54,951 --> 00:16:57,306
So Jake's a great kid, isn't he?

277
00:16:57,964 --> 00:16:59,522
Yeah, I suppose.

278
00:16:59,764 --> 00:17:03,359
I would never say this to Alan, but I
don't really care much for children.

279
00:17:05,957 --> 00:17:10,314
Well, the truth is, Alan's
not too fond of him either.

280
00:17:12,652 --> 00:17:14,961
He feeds the kid and keeps
a roof over his head...

281
00:17:15,246 --> 00:17:17,555
but there's no
love lost between them.

282
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:23,030
- Charlie, give it a rest.
- Sorry?

283
00:17:23,574 --> 00:17:25,246
Why do you push me towards Alan...

284
00:17:25,499 --> 00:17:27,649
when it's obvious
how much you want me?

285
00:17:29,850 --> 00:17:32,080
He's got a birthday coming up.

286
00:17:35,081 --> 00:17:37,959
Just tell me you want me.

287
00:17:39,015 --> 00:17:41,529
Go ahead, Charlie. Tell her.

288
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:46,251
What? No, no. You two, with the
Dungeons, the Dragons, the Boggle.

289
00:17:46,630 --> 00:17:47,983
You should be together.

290
00:17:48,262 --> 00:17:51,698
Clearly she wants you, so let's be
grown-up, and I'll get out of the way...

291
00:17:52,029 --> 00:17:54,224
so the two pretty people can mate.

292
00:17:54,916 --> 00:17:56,907
No, no, no, no.
You laid the foundation...

293
00:17:57,176 --> 00:17:59,974
and you should, you know,
lay the rest of it.

294
00:18:00,314 --> 00:18:03,545
I appreciate what you're trying to do,
but I am stepping aside...

295
00:18:03,913 --> 00:18:05,983
- No, no. I'm stepping aside.
- No, no. I am.

296
00:18:06,256 --> 00:18:08,372
No, no, I'll step aside.
I will clear the way.

297
00:18:08,641 --> 00:18:12,156
Will you both just shut up?
You're ruining everything.

298
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:15,754
- Nice going.
- Nice going.

299
00:18:16,048 --> 00:18:18,960
- Say it, Charlie.
- Say what?

300
00:18:19,312 --> 00:18:25,023
Say that slick, cool, Charlie Harper
finally wants Eckelberry Hound.

301
00:18:29,062 --> 00:18:33,135
- You knew about that name?
- That name scarred me for life.

302
00:18:33,497 --> 00:18:36,807
It's the reason I haven't eaten
a carbohydrate since college.

303
00:18:37,766 --> 00:18:40,405
- Well, you do look good.
- You're damn right I look good...

304
00:18:40,695 --> 00:18:42,765
you smug, shallow son of a bitch.

305
00:18:43,038 --> 00:18:46,428
I have spent years working
and sweating and dreaming...

306
00:18:46,762 --> 00:18:50,550
about the day that I would be
able to rub your smarmy nose in it.

307
00:18:51,114 --> 00:18:53,070
Okay, I'm getting mixed signals here.

308
00:18:55,006 --> 00:18:59,443
This is the signal, Charlie:
You can't have this.

309
00:18:59,818 --> 00:19:04,573
Not now, not ever.
Never, never, never!

310
00:19:05,593 --> 00:19:08,153
You know, I didn't make up
the Eckelberry Hound thing.

311
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:11,392
But he did spread it around.
I was always your friend.

312
00:19:11,744 --> 00:19:14,941
Oh, please. I spent years
throwing myself at you, friend.

313
00:19:15,259 --> 00:19:18,331
Playing stupid nerd games
on my bed with my shirt open, buddy.

314
00:19:18,649 --> 00:19:20,685
Hoping that you would
kiss me or touch me...

315
00:19:20,950 --> 00:19:23,180
or at least notice me
as a woman, pal!

316
00:19:24,674 --> 00:19:27,825
- You knew your shirt was open?
- Who do you think opened it?

317
00:19:31,830 --> 00:19:35,539
But I wasn't pretty enough for you.
You wanted Donna DeMarco...

318
00:19:35,889 --> 00:19:38,926
or Maxine Chernikoff,
just because they had big boobs...

319
00:19:39,236 --> 00:19:41,227
and no excess facial hair.

320
00:19:42,124 --> 00:19:45,514
Oh, yeah. Donna DeMarco,
old Double D.

321
00:19:47,857 --> 00:19:50,451
Jamie, I had no idea. I am so sorry.

322
00:19:50,744 --> 00:19:55,499
But I was a stupid teenager.
I guess I just didn't appreciate you then.

323
00:19:55,933 --> 00:19:57,446
I guess not.

324
00:19:57,732 --> 00:20:02,362
But that was a long time ago.
I'm not a stupid teenager anymore.

325
00:20:02,754 --> 00:20:06,269
Do you think maybe you could forgive
me, and maybe we could try again?

326
00:20:07,357 --> 00:20:09,632
Is that what you really want, Alan?

327
00:20:10,202 --> 00:20:11,681
Very much.

328
00:20:13,215 --> 00:20:16,093
Well, eat your heart out.

329
00:20:16,395 --> 00:20:21,310
You can never have this.
Never, never, never!

330
00:20:34,347 --> 00:20:36,941
Well, I guess we know
why she's still single.

331
00:20:42,632 --> 00:20:44,270
