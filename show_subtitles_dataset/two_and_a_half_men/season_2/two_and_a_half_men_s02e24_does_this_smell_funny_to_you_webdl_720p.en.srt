1
00:00:01,150 --> 00:00:03,539
That was very nice, Mindy.

2
00:00:03,828 --> 00:00:05,102
Okay.

3
00:00:05,334 --> 00:00:07,450
Jake, we're ready to hear your report.

4
00:00:08,890 --> 00:00:11,927
- Jake?
- Just a sec.

5
00:00:12,698 --> 00:00:14,370
Now, Jake.

6
00:00:15,208 --> 00:00:18,803
Okay, I'm finished.

7
00:00:20,605 --> 00:00:24,120
- Does spelling and grammar count?
- It's an oral report, Jake.

8
00:00:24,454 --> 00:00:26,365
Oh, so it's like an oral thermometer.

9
00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:27,904
Right.

10
00:00:28,722 --> 00:00:30,633
Good thing it's not a rectal report.

11
00:00:32,487 --> 00:00:34,876
- Just read it.
- Okay.

12
00:00:35,583 --> 00:00:37,778
"My Weekend, by Jake Harper.

13
00:00:38,052 --> 00:00:40,043
Grade five, Mrs. Flanigan's class.

14
00:00:40,311 --> 00:00:43,189
Woodward Avenue Elementary School,
located on Woodward Avenue."

15
00:00:43,491 --> 00:00:44,844
I'm not counting words.

16
00:00:45,415 --> 00:00:47,645
Oh, good.

17
00:00:51,231 --> 00:00:54,621
"My weekend starts on Friday, when
my mom takes me to my dad's house.

18
00:00:54,955 --> 00:00:56,911
Which is actually
my Uncle Charlie's house.

19
00:00:57,172 --> 00:00:59,208
Who is my dad's brother,
making him my uncle.

20
00:00:59,473 --> 00:01:02,431
His name is Charlie, which is why
I call him my Uncle Charlie."

21
00:01:05,038 --> 00:01:06,756
Anyway...

22
00:01:07,004 --> 00:01:09,723
"Even though my parents are divorced,
they still get along."

23
00:01:10,017 --> 00:01:11,166
- Hey, buddy.
- Hey, Dad.

24
00:01:11,397 --> 00:01:12,876
- How was your week?
- Just fine.

25
00:01:13,113 --> 00:01:14,387
- Bye, honey.
- Bye, Mom.

26
00:01:14,619 --> 00:01:17,008
- Thanks for bringing him.
- Bite me. What the hell...

27
00:01:17,297 --> 00:01:19,765
went on last weekend?
- What are you talking about?

28
00:01:20,058 --> 00:01:22,856
When I brought him home Sunday
night and served him dinner...

29
00:01:23,154 --> 00:01:25,748
he tipped me with a $25 chip
from Caesars Palace...

30
00:01:26,041 --> 00:01:28,760
and told me I had a nice rack.

31
00:01:30,099 --> 00:01:32,897
Well, Judith...

32
00:01:38,174 --> 00:01:39,971
you do.

33
00:01:40,224 --> 00:01:41,976
That's not the point.

34
00:01:42,233 --> 00:01:44,952
Where'd he get the chip?
Where is he learning this behavior?

35
00:01:45,245 --> 00:01:47,236
Hey, Judith.

36
00:01:48,132 --> 00:01:50,088
Looking good.

37
00:01:50,768 --> 00:01:53,965
Run away, run away.

38
00:01:54,282 --> 00:01:57,115
Did you give my son a $25 chip?

39
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:59,888
- No, I did not give him a $25 chip.
- Happy?

40
00:02:00,181 --> 00:02:03,014
He won it, fair and square.

41
00:02:03,821 --> 00:02:05,732
You couldn't run away.

42
00:02:05,997 --> 00:02:07,749
I don't care what you do on weekdays.

43
00:02:08,005 --> 00:02:11,315
But on weekends, remember you are
a role model for an 11 -year-old boy.

44
00:02:11,645 --> 00:02:15,240
Oh, that's a bad idea.
Who thought of that?

45
00:02:15,578 --> 00:02:19,617
I'm warning you. Things had better
change or there will be consequences.

46
00:02:19,971 --> 00:02:22,439
Legal consequences. Got it?

47
00:02:23,151 --> 00:02:25,381
- Got it.
- Goodbye.

48
00:02:30,305 --> 00:02:33,854
"There will be serious consequences.

49
00:02:34,196 --> 00:02:37,108
Legal consequences."

50
00:02:37,418 --> 00:02:40,694
"I don't care what you do
during the week.

51
00:02:41,644 --> 00:02:44,363
But on the weekends,
you're a role model."

52
00:02:46,037 --> 00:02:47,595
I enjoy talking this way.

53
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:51,881
As do I.

54
00:03:18,964 --> 00:03:20,443
"Friday night, I stayed up late.

55
00:03:20,679 --> 00:03:23,068
I watched all three Austin Power
movies with my dad.

56
00:03:23,357 --> 00:03:25,234
We ate Chinese food
and Buffalo wings.

57
00:03:25,491 --> 00:03:27,766
Dad fell asleep during
The Spy Who Shagged Me...

58
00:03:28,043 --> 00:03:31,001
which, in my opinion,
is the strongest of the trilogy.

59
00:03:32,143 --> 00:03:34,452
By the way,
'shag' means 'sex' in England."

60
00:03:35,114 --> 00:03:36,832
Just read, Jake.

61
00:03:37,415 --> 00:03:38,689
That was a footnote.

62
00:03:39,298 --> 00:03:42,415
- Read.
- Okay.

63
00:03:42,728 --> 00:03:44,605
"I woke up later with a stomachache...

64
00:03:44,862 --> 00:03:47,376
but felt better after
I went to the bathroom."

65
00:03:47,665 --> 00:03:49,018
If you know what I mean.

66
00:03:50,761 --> 00:03:52,399
- Jake.
- What? It's not like I said:

67
00:03:52,644 --> 00:03:54,157
"I took a dump."

68
00:03:59,631 --> 00:04:02,464
"Anyway, I tried to go back to sleep
but I couldn 't.

69
00:04:02,769 --> 00:04:04,327
Probably because I was thirsty.

70
00:04:04,568 --> 00:04:08,527
So I went into the kitchen for what
Uncle Charlie calls a 'virgin screwdriver. '

71
00:04:08,878 --> 00:04:11,028
But really it's just a glass
of orange juice.

72
00:04:11,304 --> 00:04:14,899
It was late, so I decided
to skip the glass."

73
00:04:21,889 --> 00:04:23,447
Jake?

74
00:04:24,651 --> 00:04:26,687
Hang on.

75
00:04:29,713 --> 00:04:31,032
That one hurt a little.

76
00:04:32,014 --> 00:04:34,244
- What you doing?
- Having a virgin screwdriver.

77
00:04:34,525 --> 00:04:37,119
- Want some?
- No, thanks. I'm good.

78
00:04:38,290 --> 00:04:41,282
- What are you doing?
- Watching TV.

79
00:04:42,139 --> 00:04:43,970
Why isn't it on?

80
00:04:44,775 --> 00:04:46,686
Because I've seen this one already.

81
00:04:48,415 --> 00:04:50,531
- Hey, you wanna hear a funny joke?
- Sure.

82
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,791
Why did the blond stare
at the juice carton?

83
00:04:53,059 --> 00:04:54,048
I don't know. Why?

84
00:04:54,273 --> 00:04:56,389
"Cause the carton said
'concentrate.'"

85
00:05:00,548 --> 00:05:02,300
That's okay. I didn't get it either.

86
00:05:03,561 --> 00:05:05,836
"The next morning
I was pretty hungry because..."

87
00:05:06,531 --> 00:05:07,850
I think you all know why.

88
00:05:11,594 --> 00:05:14,984
"So I had a bowl of cereal with my dad,
and we made plans for the day."

89
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:19,158
- You wanna go to the museum?
- No. I wanna watch TV.

90
00:05:20,004 --> 00:05:22,154
It's pretty windy out there.
Wanna fly a kite?

91
00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:24,386
No. I wanna watch TV.

92
00:05:25,735 --> 00:05:27,373
- Hiking?
- TV.

93
00:05:40,463 --> 00:05:41,896
- I'll get it.
- TV.

94
00:05:45,023 --> 00:05:46,854
"We decided to watch TV."

95
00:05:49,542 --> 00:05:52,215
- Hello.
- Is your name Harper?

96
00:05:52,512 --> 00:05:55,265
- Yes.
- Then this is for you.

97
00:05:59,290 --> 00:06:02,600
- Why'd you do that?
- Why did you sleep with my wife?

98
00:06:04,855 --> 00:06:07,005
Charlie.

99
00:06:11,842 --> 00:06:13,161
Busy.

100
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:16,268
I don't care. Open the door.

101
00:06:18,285 --> 00:06:20,241
- I've got company.
- I know.

102
00:06:20,502 --> 00:06:22,493
And her husband's downstairs.

103
00:06:23,264 --> 00:06:25,141
Really?

104
00:06:25,398 --> 00:06:27,036
- You're married?
- Yeah.

105
00:06:30,669 --> 00:06:32,580
I'm not in.

106
00:06:33,389 --> 00:06:35,061
You have to come and deal with him.

107
00:06:35,355 --> 00:06:36,834
- No, I don't.
- Yes, you do.

108
00:06:37,112 --> 00:06:38,545
I disagree.

109
00:06:38,786 --> 00:06:40,936
It's not up for debate.
He knows you're here.

110
00:06:41,882 --> 00:06:43,713
Oh, man, I hate when this happens.

111
00:06:44,685 --> 00:06:46,004
This happens a lot?

112
00:06:46,233 --> 00:06:48,224
Not a lot, but enough to be a drag.

113
00:06:50,292 --> 00:06:52,522
Charlie, are you coming back to bed?

114
00:06:53,179 --> 00:06:54,612
- Yes.
- Yes? No "yes."

115
00:06:54,852 --> 00:06:56,922
There is an angry husband
in your living room.

116
00:06:57,195 --> 00:06:58,947
How angry?

117
00:06:59,203 --> 00:07:01,080
- Is he packing?
- What?

118
00:07:01,337 --> 00:07:03,373
- Does he have a weapon?
- L... He has a stick.

119
00:07:04,015 --> 00:07:06,449
That's not good.
I could lose an eye.

120
00:07:06,734 --> 00:07:08,850
- Charlie! Come on.
- Fine, I'll wrap it up here.

121
00:07:09,119 --> 00:07:11,110
- Give me 20 minutes.
- Oh, no.

122
00:07:11,378 --> 00:07:12,811
A better idea. Wrap it up now.

123
00:07:14,726 --> 00:07:16,159
- Ten minutes?
- Now.

124
00:07:18,449 --> 00:07:20,917
We got five minutes.

125
00:07:22,089 --> 00:07:25,638
"The weekend was going great, but then
something really bad happened."

126
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:28,414
- Hey.
- Hello.

127
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:31,339
- Who are you?
- I'm Norman.

128
00:07:31,628 --> 00:07:34,938
I'm Jake.
Have you seen my Game Boy?

129
00:07:35,268 --> 00:07:37,987
No. Have you seen my wife?

130
00:07:39,076 --> 00:07:41,510
No. Well, if you see it, let me know.

131
00:07:41,795 --> 00:07:43,069
Ditto.

132
00:07:45,979 --> 00:07:47,253
"I couldn 't believe it.

133
00:07:47,904 --> 00:07:49,257
I lost my Game Boy."

134
00:07:56,146 --> 00:07:58,944
"I couldn't find my Game Boy
in the kitchen or living room...

135
00:07:59,242 --> 00:08:01,233
so I checked my bedroom
and my bathroom.

136
00:08:01,501 --> 00:08:05,574
Because, as you may recall, I'd spent
a lot of time in there the night before."

137
00:08:12,965 --> 00:08:16,002
- He'll be right down.
- Thank you.

138
00:08:24,052 --> 00:08:26,008
Can I get you a cup of coffee?

139
00:08:27,148 --> 00:08:29,616
Decaf. I'm already pretty enraged.

140
00:08:32,295 --> 00:08:35,014
Well, that's certainly understandable.

141
00:08:37,357 --> 00:08:38,949
I have cookies too.

142
00:08:40,621 --> 00:08:44,660
- I wouldn't say no to a cookie.
- Good. Come on in the kitchen.

143
00:08:45,014 --> 00:08:48,051
I always find a nice cookie
can brighten up even the darkest day.

144
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:50,829
Yeah, well, this better be
one hell of a cookie.

145
00:08:52,545 --> 00:08:55,013
- It's a nice house you got here.
- Oh, thank you.

146
00:08:55,306 --> 00:08:56,580
Actually, it belongs to my...

147
00:08:58,695 --> 00:09:00,651
You live in the neighborhood?

148
00:09:02,711 --> 00:09:05,271
- Bel-Air.
- Oh, that's nice too.

149
00:09:05,556 --> 00:09:08,514
Gated community,
but the wife gets out anyway.

150
00:09:12,042 --> 00:09:13,475
Chews through her leash, huh?

151
00:09:16,351 --> 00:09:18,581
Hey, let me get you that cookie.

152
00:09:18,861 --> 00:09:22,012
You see like a nice fella.
I'm sorry I hit you with my stick.

153
00:09:22,334 --> 00:09:24,529
Oh, that's okay.
I'm sorry my brother is...

154
00:09:26,518 --> 00:09:28,827
That's okay.

155
00:09:29,112 --> 00:09:31,182
So women, huh?

156
00:09:31,789 --> 00:09:33,507
Can't live with them.

157
00:09:36,601 --> 00:09:38,353
That's all I got.

158
00:09:38,609 --> 00:09:40,520
- You married?
- Divorced.

159
00:09:40,785 --> 00:09:43,857
- She sleep around?
- No, mostly just slept.

160
00:09:45,596 --> 00:09:46,870
You're lucky.

161
00:09:47,102 --> 00:09:50,856
There's no pain greater than being
betrayed by the woman you love.

162
00:09:51,203 --> 00:09:54,240
You know, these are really very tasty.

163
00:09:55,094 --> 00:09:56,652
Aren't they?

164
00:09:56,893 --> 00:10:00,249
- Good morning.
- Oh, speaking of tasty cookies...

165
00:10:00,575 --> 00:10:03,009
Norman, this is Berta.

166
00:10:03,294 --> 00:10:05,683
- Hello.
- What is this, a fix-up?

167
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:11,095
No, no. Nothing like that.

168
00:10:11,369 --> 00:10:13,325
That's good,
because I'd probably kill him.

169
00:10:17,268 --> 00:10:20,260
Nothing personal, Cotton Top.
I just kind of like it rough.

170
00:10:25,761 --> 00:10:29,151
- Have another cookie.
- Thank you.

171
00:10:29,485 --> 00:10:31,840
So is anybody gonna tell me
what's going on?

172
00:10:32,121 --> 00:10:34,032
Well, it's a little complicated.

173
00:10:34,297 --> 00:10:36,208
- Charlie...
- Got it.

174
00:10:37,602 --> 00:10:38,955
Got it? How could you get it?

175
00:10:39,903 --> 00:10:42,497
There's a Rolls-Royce in the driveway...

176
00:10:42,790 --> 00:10:46,180
and I found these
hanging on the mailbox...

177
00:10:46,514 --> 00:10:49,551
so I'm guessing that your brother's
got some bimbo upstairs...

178
00:10:49,861 --> 00:10:52,216
and Norman here is her daddy
or her sugar daddy.

179
00:10:53,417 --> 00:10:55,453
- Tell me I'm wrong.
- I'm the husband.

180
00:10:55,718 --> 00:10:57,117
Judges?

181
00:11:00,027 --> 00:11:03,736
- You gotta give it to her.
- Yes.

182
00:11:04,086 --> 00:11:06,316
- I mean, tough break.
- Thank you.

183
00:11:06,596 --> 00:11:08,552
- You got a gun?
- No!

184
00:11:09,190 --> 00:11:10,464
- Want one?
- Berta!

185
00:11:12,454 --> 00:11:13,967
I'm making small talk.

186
00:11:16,345 --> 00:11:17,619
Okay.

187
00:11:17,851 --> 00:11:20,081
You wanna talk this out like gentlemen,
or you...?

188
00:11:23,332 --> 00:11:25,482
You might've mentioned
he fought at the Alamo.

189
00:11:29,273 --> 00:11:32,071
- No offense.
- None taken.

190
00:11:34,837 --> 00:11:36,987
- Does that make us even?
- You tell me.

191
00:11:38,268 --> 00:11:39,826
Okay. One more.

192
00:11:43,623 --> 00:11:44,897
How about that?

193
00:11:45,130 --> 00:11:48,486
- He poked you, you poked his...
- Berta!

194
00:11:49,732 --> 00:11:52,451
What? How often do you see
that kind of symmetry in life?

195
00:12:02,702 --> 00:12:03,976
Hey.

196
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:06,654
Hello.

197
00:12:06,886 --> 00:12:08,717
Were you just up in
Uncle Charlie's room?

198
00:12:08,978 --> 00:12:10,889
- Yeah.
- Did you see my Game Boy?

199
00:12:11,153 --> 00:12:12,142
No.

200
00:12:12,367 --> 00:12:14,278
- Did you see my husband?
- The old guy?

201
00:12:14,542 --> 00:12:16,134
- Yeah.
- He's in the kitchen.

202
00:12:16,383 --> 00:12:18,977
Thanks.

203
00:12:21,069 --> 00:12:22,946
Well, that's weird.

204
00:12:23,203 --> 00:12:25,319
If I was a Game Boy,
where would I be?

205
00:12:27,261 --> 00:12:30,810
I am so sorry.
I had no idea that she was married.

206
00:12:31,152 --> 00:12:34,224
I have a firm rule when it comes
to sleeping with married women.

207
00:12:34,541 --> 00:12:37,339
Yeah, if she's firm enough,
he'll do her.

208
00:12:42,281 --> 00:12:44,476
Sorry. Isn't there something
you could clean?

209
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:47,787
I'm guessing you could
use a good scrubbing.

210
00:12:50,064 --> 00:12:51,975
Wait a minute.

211
00:12:53,369 --> 00:12:56,327
"And suddenly I realized...

212
00:12:56,632 --> 00:12:59,100
I might have left it
in my mom's car."

213
00:12:59,394 --> 00:13:02,431
Hey, Mom, did I leave
my Game Boy in your car?

214
00:13:02,741 --> 00:13:04,493
Well, can you go look?

215
00:13:04,749 --> 00:13:06,819
Can't you just dry off
and put on a robe?

216
00:13:07,385 --> 00:13:09,580
There's another $25 chip in it for you.

217
00:13:12,196 --> 00:13:14,994
She wasn't wearing a ring.
There was no mention of a husband.

218
00:13:15,292 --> 00:13:17,169
Is that supposed to cheer me up?

219
00:13:17,426 --> 00:13:20,862
- No, no, no. I just wanted you to know...
- Now, now. I get it.

220
00:13:21,192 --> 00:13:24,662
You're a nice guy,
and I married a skeevy tramp.

221
00:13:24,999 --> 00:13:28,036
No, no, no.
I mean, yeah, I am a nice guy...

222
00:13:28,346 --> 00:13:30,337
but I'm sure Annette
is a lovely woman.

223
00:13:30,605 --> 00:13:32,755
Her name is Natalie.

224
00:13:33,450 --> 00:13:36,999
- Really? You sure?
- Yes, I'm sure.

225
00:13:37,341 --> 00:13:40,174
Because I've been yelling
"Annette" all night.

226
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:43,152
Her name is Natalie.

227
00:13:43,450 --> 00:13:46,169
Well, then maybe this is all
just a huge misunderstanding...

228
00:13:46,462 --> 00:13:49,374
and I've been upstairs
doing someone else's wife.

229
00:13:49,684 --> 00:13:54,075
Five-foot six, long brown hair,
butterfly tattoo on her left hip.

230
00:13:54,872 --> 00:13:57,022
Left hip, huh?

231
00:14:03,742 --> 00:14:06,859
Hold on now.
A lot of women have butterfly tattoos.

232
00:14:08,302 --> 00:14:12,136
But the one I slept with also had a little
beauty mark in a certain intimate place.

233
00:14:12,486 --> 00:14:14,397
I'm not here to claim a lost wallet.

234
00:14:16,879 --> 00:14:20,713
Okay, let's just assume it's her.
Again, I am really sorry.

235
00:14:21,063 --> 00:14:23,702
It's my own fault anyway.

236
00:14:23,992 --> 00:14:26,142
I should've realized
back when I married her...

237
00:14:26,418 --> 00:14:29,251
a man my age couldn't satisfy
a woman that young.

238
00:14:29,556 --> 00:14:32,992
If it makes you feel any better,
I couldn't ring her bell, either.

239
00:14:33,322 --> 00:14:35,677
- You couldn't?
- You don't know me...

240
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:37,789
but there's things I don't kid about.

241
00:14:38,803 --> 00:14:41,192
So it's not just me.

242
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:42,799
- That's a relief.
- Tell me...

243
00:14:43,028 --> 00:14:44,939
about it.
I was killing myself up there.

244
00:14:46,208 --> 00:14:47,482
So anyway...

245
00:14:47,714 --> 00:14:48,988
are we okay?

246
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:52,098
You mean, aside from the fact
that you just rolled off my wife?

247
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:55,039
Oh, yeah. We're aces.

248
00:14:56,668 --> 00:14:58,977
Good. Thank you.

249
00:14:59,429 --> 00:15:02,705
- Can I give you a little advice, kid?
- Sure.

250
00:15:03,027 --> 00:15:05,257
I was a player once, like you.

251
00:15:05,538 --> 00:15:07,654
Do tell.

252
00:15:07,922 --> 00:15:11,710
Does the name Tuesday Weld
mean anything to you?

253
00:15:13,069 --> 00:15:14,787
No.

254
00:15:15,453 --> 00:15:17,125
Joey Heatherton?

255
00:15:17,378 --> 00:15:18,857
No.

256
00:15:19,846 --> 00:15:22,804
The immortal Miss Anne Francis.

257
00:15:24,993 --> 00:15:27,029
TV's Honey West.

258
00:15:29,051 --> 00:15:31,770
- Sorry.
- Well, look them up on your Internet.

259
00:15:32,063 --> 00:15:34,531
They were all hot, and I nailed them.

260
00:15:37,126 --> 00:15:40,084
Really. Well, kudos.

261
00:15:41,561 --> 00:15:43,517
But nothing lasts forever.

262
00:15:43,778 --> 00:15:47,009
There's going to come a time
when you'll wanna settle down.

263
00:15:47,335 --> 00:15:49,895
And I only hope you don't make
the same mistake I did.

264
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:51,579
I picked a young hottie...

265
00:15:51,811 --> 00:15:55,281
because I figured I'd die in the sack
with a smile on my face.

266
00:15:55,953 --> 00:15:58,467
That's my retirement plan.

267
00:15:58,757 --> 00:16:00,952
But it doesn't work that way.

268
00:16:01,225 --> 00:16:03,693
What happens is...

269
00:16:04,530 --> 00:16:06,600
you get your heart broken...

270
00:16:06,873 --> 00:16:09,182
and you wind up having
coffee with some putz...

271
00:16:09,467 --> 00:16:11,344
who never heard of Honey West.

272
00:16:14,028 --> 00:16:15,586
Got it.

273
00:16:15,827 --> 00:16:17,180
Thanks for the advice.

274
00:16:17,877 --> 00:16:19,435
Well, I'll be getting home now.

275
00:16:19,676 --> 00:16:22,952
I got lawyers to call, locks to change.

276
00:16:23,274 --> 00:16:26,186
Maybe I'll stop at the market,
pick up some of those cookies.

277
00:16:26,496 --> 00:16:29,294
- Here. Take the box.
- Oh, thanks.

278
00:16:29,592 --> 00:16:32,425
Looks like I'm the big winner
around here today.

279
00:16:37,374 --> 00:16:41,083
- Hello? Anybody home?
- Hello.

280
00:16:42,771 --> 00:16:45,046
- Hello. Who are you?
- Norman.

281
00:16:45,323 --> 00:16:47,598
Oh, hello, Norman. I'm Evelyn.

282
00:16:48,419 --> 00:16:50,887
Is that your magnificent Rolls-Royce
out in the drive?

283
00:16:51,181 --> 00:16:52,660
Why, yes, it is.

284
00:16:52,896 --> 00:16:54,966
- Are you a friend of Charlie's?
- No.

285
00:16:55,239 --> 00:16:57,389
But my wife is.

286
00:16:58,377 --> 00:17:01,733
Did my son polish your trophy wife?

287
00:17:04,318 --> 00:17:06,388
Well, you seem
like a very intelligent man.

288
00:17:06,661 --> 00:17:08,572
I assume you had an airtight prenup.

289
00:17:08,837 --> 00:17:10,111
Bulletproof.

290
00:17:10,343 --> 00:17:11,981
You know what, Norman?

291
00:17:12,225 --> 00:17:15,137
You look a lot like my fifth husband.

292
00:17:15,447 --> 00:17:18,757
Really?
How many times you been married?

293
00:17:19,087 --> 00:17:21,078
Four.

294
00:17:23,647 --> 00:17:25,877
Cookie?

295
00:17:26,158 --> 00:17:29,230
"When Grandma came over,
I thought things couldn't get any worse.

296
00:17:29,547 --> 00:17:31,139
But instead of making me visit...

297
00:17:31,388 --> 00:17:34,664
she gave my dad money to take me,
my uncle and Berta to the movies.

298
00:17:35,279 --> 00:17:37,998
We saw the Rob Schneider movie
where he plays a stupid guy.

299
00:17:38,291 --> 00:17:41,169
I had popcorn, nachos
and two jumbo red Slurpees.

300
00:17:41,471 --> 00:17:44,144
But as you know,
you don't buy Slurpees. You rent them."

301
00:17:48,793 --> 00:17:51,432
- Hurry up, hurry up, hurry up.
- Cool your jets.

302
00:17:51,721 --> 00:17:54,474
And if you can't cool them,
point the nozzle away from me.

303
00:17:56,867 --> 00:17:58,505
Oh, God. Mom!

304
00:17:59,629 --> 00:18:01,267
- We can't go in right now.
- Why not?

305
00:18:01,512 --> 00:18:04,982
Because I can't afford to send you
to therapy for the rest of your life.

306
00:18:05,319 --> 00:18:07,514
What's going on?

307
00:18:07,787 --> 00:18:11,143
- Oh, God!
- What? What, what, what?

308
00:18:11,469 --> 00:18:15,144
Good for Norman.
That's getting right back on the horse.

309
00:18:15,486 --> 00:18:18,444
- There's a horse in there?
- No, no. No horse.

310
00:18:18,749 --> 00:18:21,900
- Well, I still have to pee.
- So go water that bush over there.

311
00:18:22,222 --> 00:18:24,258
"And so I did.
And it just goes to show...

312
00:18:24,941 --> 00:18:27,091
it's always
in the last place you look."

313
00:18:27,703 --> 00:18:29,341
Very nice, Jake.

314
00:18:29,585 --> 00:18:31,815
"Then on Sunday,
we all went out for breakfast...

315
00:18:32,096 --> 00:18:33,609
with Grandma and Uncle Norman.

316
00:18:33,853 --> 00:18:37,323
I had chocolate-chip pancakes
with blueberry syrup and bacon.

317
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:40,493
Dad had scrambled eggs
but with no yolks. Just the whites.

318
00:18:40,798 --> 00:18:42,675
They looked like mashed potatoes.

319
00:18:42,932 --> 00:18:47,289
Then the kid next to us threw up
his waffles. It was awesome."

320
00:18:48,706 --> 00:18:51,504
- So, what's new in school?
- Almost got an A on my paper.

321
00:18:52,178 --> 00:18:53,611
What do you mean "almost"?

322
00:18:54,187 --> 00:18:55,825
Got a C.

323
00:18:58,580 --> 00:19:00,889
Okay, that's... That's fine.
That's an improvement.

324
00:19:01,425 --> 00:19:03,416
Minus.

325
00:19:03,684 --> 00:19:05,276
Still, here's your dollar.

326
00:19:07,115 --> 00:19:09,106
You're paying him for a C-minus?

327
00:19:09,374 --> 00:19:12,810
That was our deal. A buck for every C,
a car for every A.

328
00:19:14,353 --> 00:19:16,583
- A car?
- Safest bet in the world.

329
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:21,470
- So, what was the report about?
- What we did last weekend.

330
00:19:25,775 --> 00:19:28,414
- No kidding?
- Yeah. And guess what else happened.

331
00:19:28,704 --> 00:19:31,696
Trevor Griffin saw a ginormous rat
in the cafeteria.

332
00:19:32,009 --> 00:19:34,682
Yeah, but about the paper.

333
00:19:34,979 --> 00:19:37,971
You wrote about everything
that happened here last weekend?

334
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:41,674
Well, everything but the boring stuff.

335
00:19:41,967 --> 00:19:44,356
Oh, this could be problematic.

336
00:19:44,644 --> 00:19:47,033
No, it's called "summarizing."

337
00:19:52,133 --> 00:19:54,044
- Can I see it?
- Sure.

338
00:19:54,309 --> 00:19:58,222
But it's at Mom's house.
I gave it to her to read this weekend.

339
00:20:01,212 --> 00:20:03,442
He's 11.
There's no way it stands up in court.

340
00:20:07,279 --> 00:20:09,793
Does this smell funny to you?
