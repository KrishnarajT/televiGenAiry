1
00:00:01,170 --> 00:00:05,482
The snap, the kick is up,
and it is good! It is good!

2
00:00:05,853 --> 00:00:09,892
- Man.
- Okay, well, that's the game.

3
00:00:10,244 --> 00:00:12,599
Dad, can I have my allowance?

4
00:00:12,878 --> 00:00:14,357
Sure. Here.

5
00:00:14,593 --> 00:00:16,823
Thanks. Here.

6
00:00:17,645 --> 00:00:19,203
Pleasure doing business with you.

7
00:00:19,485 --> 00:00:21,874
You're taking my son's allowance
on a football bet?

8
00:00:22,203 --> 00:00:25,752
Hey, when he wins, I pay off.
You know, minus the vig.

9
00:00:26,134 --> 00:00:29,444
Minus the vig. You're charging him for
the privilege of making a bet?

10
00:00:29,814 --> 00:00:32,647
That's what the vig is, Dad.

11
00:00:33,661 --> 00:00:35,970
Face it. He's not gonna learn
this stuff in school.

12
00:00:36,295 --> 00:00:38,365
I don't care.
Give him his allowance back.

13
00:00:38,679 --> 00:00:40,351
Fine.

14
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:44,569
You get no allowance.
That's your punishment for gambling.

15
00:00:44,951 --> 00:00:48,864
- Told you he'd do that.
- Yeah, you did.

16
00:00:50,847 --> 00:00:53,236
Pleasure doing business with you.

17
00:00:55,363 --> 00:00:59,072
Hey, listen. After you drop him off at his
mom's house tonight, do me a favor?

18
00:00:59,461 --> 00:01:01,929
- Just make yourself scarce, okay?
- What's her name?

19
00:01:02,221 --> 00:01:04,212
Or is it too early to ask?

20
00:01:04,855 --> 00:01:06,925
It's not a girl.
I'm just having friends over.

21
00:01:07,239 --> 00:01:08,877
Oh, poker? Oh, can I play?

22
00:01:09,163 --> 00:01:11,279
- I'm better than I used to be.
- It's not poker.

23
00:01:11,546 --> 00:01:13,059
Wait. A flush beats a straight...

24
00:01:13,302 --> 00:01:15,941
and a full boat beats a flush, right?
- Right...

25
00:01:16,229 --> 00:01:18,220
A full house and a full boat
are the same...

26
00:01:18,487 --> 00:01:20,523
so I won't say
"full houseboat" anymore.

27
00:01:21,582 --> 00:01:23,618
- It's not poker, Alan.
- Then what's going on?

28
00:01:24,258 --> 00:01:26,852
I'm just having some
friends over to smoke cigars...

29
00:01:27,143 --> 00:01:30,419
sample some fine single-malt Scotch
and, you know, talk.

30
00:01:30,781 --> 00:01:33,898
I enjoy all those things.
Well, Scotch makes me a little gassy.

31
00:01:34,210 --> 00:01:36,405
But I'll take a Beano
and I'm good to go.

32
00:01:37,514 --> 00:01:39,948
That's nice, but I don't think
you'd be comfortable.

33
00:01:40,273 --> 00:01:43,151
- Why not?
- Because we talk about personal things.

34
00:01:43,493 --> 00:01:47,008
- You mean like a support group?
- No, no, no. It's not a support group.

35
00:01:47,382 --> 00:01:50,021
It's just guys who get together
to talk about their lives.

36
00:01:50,351 --> 00:01:52,785
- That's a support group.
- No, it's not.

37
00:01:53,111 --> 00:01:54,464
Okay, it's not.

38
00:01:54,742 --> 00:01:56,414
It's not.

39
00:01:57,334 --> 00:01:59,484
Got it. So why can't I come?

40
00:01:59,801 --> 00:02:01,678
Because these men are my friends.

41
00:02:01,934 --> 00:02:04,164
There's a level of trust
and confidentiality.

42
00:02:04,443 --> 00:02:06,957
- I'm your friend.
- No, you're my brother.

43
00:02:07,286 --> 00:02:09,436
Wait a minute.
You don't consider me a friend?

44
00:02:09,712 --> 00:02:11,430
It's not up to me.

45
00:02:12,973 --> 00:02:16,363
A friend is someone you choose.
A brother is someone you get.

46
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:19,180
- Excuse me?
- There's no choice involved.

47
00:02:19,497 --> 00:02:21,852
Your dad just wakes you up
in the night and says:

48
00:02:22,131 --> 00:02:25,043
"Your mom wasn't really fat
and this isn't your room anymore."

49
00:02:25,393 --> 00:02:28,749
So all these years,
I've just been an intruder to you?

50
00:02:29,073 --> 00:02:30,791
An inconvenience? A burden?

51
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:33,116
Well, sure. You can spin it that way.

52
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:36,160
You know, I had no idea
you felt this way.

53
00:02:38,021 --> 00:02:39,340
I am very, very hurt.

54
00:02:41,659 --> 00:02:43,615
Okay.

55
00:02:44,628 --> 00:02:48,064
But you'll still
make yourself scarce, right?

56
00:02:56,086 --> 00:02:57,917
- Bye, Uncle Charlie.
- See you, buddy.

57
00:02:58,176 --> 00:03:00,406
- Oh, he's your buddy?
- Alan, don't start.

58
00:03:00,727 --> 00:03:02,843
How is he your buddy?
You didn't choose him.

59
00:03:03,361 --> 00:03:06,398
- I chose to let him stay here.
- You chose to let me stay here too.

60
00:03:06,958 --> 00:03:09,597
No. I chose him, I got you.

61
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:13,603
You know, there are times
I just loathe you.

62
00:03:13,941 --> 00:03:16,933
And yet you're surprised
I don't consider you a friend.

63
00:03:18,248 --> 00:03:21,240
Okay, have your real friends
to your little "support group."

64
00:03:21,551 --> 00:03:23,189
- It is not...
- It is a support group!

65
00:03:24,228 --> 00:03:26,344
It's a support group for weak,
rudderless men.

66
00:03:26,611 --> 00:03:29,762
And I wouldn't be a part of it
if you begged me.

67
00:03:35,518 --> 00:03:37,031
Okay, bye.

68
00:03:39,407 --> 00:03:41,762
Dad, check this out.
You can pick your friends...

69
00:03:42,041 --> 00:03:45,158
you can pick your nose,
but you can't pick your friend's nose.

70
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:48,587
- You know who told me that?
- I can guess.

71
00:03:48,941 --> 00:03:52,456
Uncle Charlie. And you know
why it's funny? Because it's true.

72
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:56,532
Yeah, yeah. Have a nice week, Jake.

73
00:03:56,844 --> 00:03:59,199
Bye, Dad. Hi, Mom.
Can I have my allowance?

74
00:03:59,478 --> 00:04:01,867
I missed you too, sweetie.

75
00:04:02,154 --> 00:04:05,385
- Thanks for dropping him by.
- Judith, hold on.

76
00:04:06,671 --> 00:04:08,389
Do you consider us friends?

77
00:04:09,305 --> 00:04:11,057
I consider you my ex-husband.

78
00:04:12,232 --> 00:04:14,268
I know. But putting aside
for the moment...

79
00:04:14,532 --> 00:04:17,205
our loveless marriage and
messy divorce...

80
00:04:17,501 --> 00:04:19,890
we always had a certain
camaraderie, am I right?

81
00:04:20,177 --> 00:04:23,249
Can we talk some other time?
I'm having people over for dinner.

82
00:04:23,564 --> 00:04:25,043
Oh, really? Anybody I know?

83
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:28,676
- Sandra and Howard.
- Oh, no kidding. Can I say hello?

84
00:04:29,042 --> 00:04:31,510
- I'd rather you didn't.
- Why not?

85
00:04:31,802 --> 00:04:35,556
Sandra and Howard are my friends too.
In fact, I introduced them to you.

86
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:38,695
Well, why don't you call them
and invite them to your house.

87
00:04:39,663 --> 00:04:42,894
This is my house.
Those were my friends.

88
00:04:43,218 --> 00:04:46,051
The fact is, you're having
my friends for dinner in my house.

89
00:04:46,396 --> 00:04:49,035
Yes, Alan, that is exactly
what's happening.

90
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:54,570
Well, when I'm right, I'm right.

91
00:04:57,184 --> 00:05:00,494
I've got something I wanna talk about,
but it's gotta stay in this room.

92
00:05:01,157 --> 00:05:02,670
Everything stays in the room.

93
00:05:03,331 --> 00:05:05,925
Yeah, sure, Judas.
Does that include veiled references...

94
00:05:06,216 --> 00:05:07,854
in one of your wise-ass songs?

95
00:05:09,018 --> 00:05:11,452
- I said sorry about that.
- Too little, too late.

96
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:14,748
We have to go through this
every time we get together?

97
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:16,870
- It's water under the bridge.
- Thank you.

98
00:05:17,172 --> 00:05:20,084
It wouldn't have killed you
to thank him in your Grammy speech.

99
00:05:20,392 --> 00:05:24,465
That I would've done, but, you know,
Bacharach, he just went on so long.

100
00:05:24,866 --> 00:05:26,060
Well, get on with it.

101
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:30,162
All right. How do I say this?

102
00:05:30,888 --> 00:05:34,085
Do any of you get up in
the middle of the night to pee?

103
00:05:34,442 --> 00:05:36,592
- Sure.
- Occasionally.

104
00:05:37,327 --> 00:05:39,761
Sometimes, I don't even get up.

105
00:05:42,638 --> 00:05:45,027
This is what I can't
write songs about?

106
00:05:45,314 --> 00:05:47,464
Oh, drat.

107
00:05:48,827 --> 00:05:52,581
All right, look.
It's not about peeing, per se.

108
00:05:52,966 --> 00:05:54,285
It's about getting older.

109
00:05:55,392 --> 00:05:57,189
I'm laying in bed with my wife.

110
00:05:57,441 --> 00:05:59,955
She looks beautiful, sexy.

111
00:06:00,242 --> 00:06:04,235
All I wanna do is finish
my Corn Pops and go to sleep.

112
00:06:09,065 --> 00:06:11,181
What are you doing?

113
00:06:11,449 --> 00:06:15,044
Shopping list. You know,
just a shopping list.

114
00:06:19,896 --> 00:06:22,694
So you're saying
the old flag's at half-mast?

115
00:06:24,077 --> 00:06:25,556
No, the old flag is fine.

116
00:06:25,792 --> 00:06:28,909
And I'd rather not refer to it
as an old flag, if you don't mind.

117
00:06:29,263 --> 00:06:34,383
No, my point is, it's about
shifting priorities or something.

118
00:06:34,782 --> 00:06:37,057
Flag, drag, hag.

119
00:06:37,375 --> 00:06:41,209
I will knock your glasses through
your eyeballs. I will do it.

120
00:06:41,933 --> 00:06:43,525
Let me tell you something, fellas.

121
00:06:44,483 --> 00:06:47,600
It doesn't matter what the calendar
says, you're as old as you feel.

122
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:50,496
Me, I feel...

123
00:06:50,756 --> 00:06:52,109
like...

124
00:06:52,554 --> 00:06:54,112
boiled crap.

125
00:06:57,488 --> 00:06:59,524
- Hello.
- Oh, man.

126
00:06:59,788 --> 00:07:01,585
I'm sorry, guys. It's my brother.

127
00:07:04,513 --> 00:07:06,151
We agreed you weren't
gonna be here.

128
00:07:06,395 --> 00:07:09,228
Don't worry,
I just need my phone book.

129
00:07:09,531 --> 00:07:11,487
- Is that...?
- Yes.

130
00:07:11,789 --> 00:07:14,906
- And that...?
- Yeah.

131
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:17,569
And that?

132
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:20,341
He used to be. Not anymore.

133
00:07:22,954 --> 00:07:24,307
Him I don't recognize.

134
00:07:24,585 --> 00:07:26,064
He's our bookie.

135
00:07:26,341 --> 00:07:28,093
You can have
your bookie, but not me?

136
00:07:28,683 --> 00:07:30,719
Bookies, like friends, are chosen.

137
00:07:31,861 --> 00:07:35,137
Okay. Okay, fine.
I'm sorry to interrupt.

138
00:07:35,499 --> 00:07:38,013
I need my address book
so I can call one of my friends.

139
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:40,894
They don't care.
Hurry up and get out.

140
00:07:42,064 --> 00:07:45,500
Hurry up and get out.
Sounds like sex with my ex-wife.

141
00:07:48,462 --> 00:07:52,421
I don't know if Charlie told you,
but I'm recently divorced...

142
00:07:52,810 --> 00:07:54,607
and it's been
kind of a rough road.

143
00:07:55,529 --> 00:07:57,326
- Here's your phone book.
- Thank you.

144
00:07:57,577 --> 00:08:00,887
Of course, I guess in hindsight,
I should have seen it coming, but...

145
00:08:01,215 --> 00:08:03,126
- I'm gonna count to three.
- Bye.

146
00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:10,112
Sorry about that. He's bent
out of shape because I told him...

147
00:08:10,415 --> 00:08:12,690
he couldn't be part of the group.
- Why not?

148
00:08:13,677 --> 00:08:16,749
You just saw him, didn't you?
Trust me, he doesn't get any better.

149
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:20,669
I mean, he actually thinks
this is a support group.

150
00:08:20,994 --> 00:08:22,746
This is a support group, Charlie.

151
00:08:23,002 --> 00:08:26,039
You're the only one who's pretending
it's about Scotch and cigars.

152
00:08:27,434 --> 00:08:30,506
Whatever kind of group it is,
we have rules about new guys joining.

153
00:08:30,821 --> 00:08:32,095
Well, but he's your brother.

154
00:08:32,326 --> 00:08:34,237
He's obviously
going through a rough time.

155
00:08:34,501 --> 00:08:36,571
Seems like you should be
more supportive, pal.

156
00:08:36,884 --> 00:08:38,602
Hey, I support him plenty.

157
00:08:38,850 --> 00:08:41,159
I share my home with him.
I share my food with him.

158
00:08:41,442 --> 00:08:44,002
I moved my foosball table
so he could park in my garage.

159
00:08:44,286 --> 00:08:46,675
What more do you people
want from me?

160
00:08:47,422 --> 00:08:50,095
Let me tell you something
about sharing, kid.

161
00:08:51,813 --> 00:08:54,088
Sharing is a two-way street.

162
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:56,651
When you share with
another human being...

163
00:08:56,914 --> 00:08:59,747
you always get back
more than you gave.

164
00:09:00,678 --> 00:09:03,511
Assuming that you're smart enough
to share with somebody...

165
00:09:03,814 --> 00:09:07,045
that's got more stuff
than you had in the beginning.

166
00:09:09,835 --> 00:09:12,349
Hey, Dick, it's Alan.
How's it going, buddy?

167
00:09:12,637 --> 00:09:14,036
Oh, good, good.

168
00:09:14,268 --> 00:09:17,066
Listen. You maybe wanna
catch a movie tonight?

169
00:09:18,826 --> 00:09:24,662
Oh, really? You and Roz are
at Judith's too. Interesting.

170
00:09:25,098 --> 00:09:30,047
So in addition to my house,
half my money, and my self-esteem...

171
00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:33,442
Judith got custody of
all my friends.

172
00:09:34,674 --> 00:09:38,064
No, no, no, I don't wanna
take it up with her. I...

173
00:09:38,772 --> 00:09:40,524
Hi, Judith.

174
00:09:40,779 --> 00:09:44,931
No, no. I'm not trying to
ruin your party.

175
00:09:45,462 --> 00:09:48,295
In fact, I've got a little party
of my own.

176
00:09:49,811 --> 00:09:52,564
Alan, come back to bed. I'm cold.

177
00:09:53,575 --> 00:09:55,054
Be right there, baby.

178
00:09:55,289 --> 00:09:58,361
I gotta go, Judith. Bye.

179
00:10:01,101 --> 00:10:03,137
Well, that's a new personal low.

180
00:10:08,461 --> 00:10:11,055
You know, as long as
we're talking about getting older...

181
00:10:11,346 --> 00:10:13,985
I was at this club the other night,
window-shopping.

182
00:10:15,235 --> 00:10:18,944
I realize I'm the oldest
guy in the bar.

183
00:10:19,291 --> 00:10:21,043
I mean, I still look good.

184
00:10:24,184 --> 00:10:27,017
But I'm competing for women
with guys who are way younger.

185
00:10:28,031 --> 00:10:33,549
I gotta tell you, I felt kind of depressed,
like maybe my best days are behind me.

186
00:10:34,261 --> 00:10:35,819
Oh, you're breaking my heart.

187
00:10:37,523 --> 00:10:42,517
There's maybe 11 women in this city
who haven't saluted his old flag.

188
00:10:44,004 --> 00:10:46,279
We should talk about
Charlie and his brother.

189
00:10:46,555 --> 00:10:48,432
What? Why?

190
00:10:48,688 --> 00:10:52,124
We've been meeting all these years and
I never even knew you had a brother.

191
00:10:53,246 --> 00:10:54,838
I didn't see that it was relevant.

192
00:10:55,127 --> 00:10:59,086
Let me tell you something
about relevant.

193
00:10:59,434 --> 00:11:03,871
The root of the word relevant
is "rel"...

194
00:11:06,334 --> 00:11:10,373
which is also the root
of the word "relative."

195
00:11:11,937 --> 00:11:18,410
Your brother is your relative, ergo,
your brother is relevant.

196
00:11:25,569 --> 00:11:26,843
What?

197
00:11:28,413 --> 00:11:32,247
Another "rel" word is "relapse."

198
00:11:32,594 --> 00:11:33,947
But I'll wait my turn.

199
00:11:36,525 --> 00:11:38,959
Hi. Is this Doug Ziskin?

200
00:11:39,285 --> 00:11:41,241
Yeah, yeah.
Hey, Doug, it's Alan Harper.

201
00:11:41,501 --> 00:11:46,017
I'm your chiropractor.
But I'm calling as a friend.

202
00:11:46,394 --> 00:11:49,272
Well, I'd like to think we are.

203
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:56,593
Forget it. Sorry I woke you.

204
00:11:58,562 --> 00:12:01,759
Hey, neighbor. What are you doing
out here all by your Ionesome?

205
00:12:02,116 --> 00:12:05,313
Charlie's got some friends over and
I thought I'd give him some space.

206
00:12:05,671 --> 00:12:07,389
Oh, yeah. His support group.

207
00:12:07,678 --> 00:12:09,396
He claims it's not a support group.

208
00:12:09,685 --> 00:12:13,883
Oh, please. He also claims
he's not in love with me.

209
00:12:15,790 --> 00:12:17,064
What do you want, Rose?

210
00:12:17,755 --> 00:12:20,508
Nothing. I was just sitting
over there in Charlie's car...

211
00:12:20,808 --> 00:12:23,402
and thought you might
like some company.

212
00:12:25,491 --> 00:12:27,925
From the minute they
brought him from the hospital...

213
00:12:28,251 --> 00:12:29,764
everything was about the baby.

214
00:12:30,007 --> 00:12:33,397
"Don't wake the baby. Don't tease
the baby. Don't paint the baby."

215
00:12:35,653 --> 00:12:37,723
Then when he starts growing up,
it gets worse.

216
00:12:37,994 --> 00:12:40,633
Everything he does,
I get blamed for.

217
00:12:40,963 --> 00:12:44,478
He wakes up one morning with no
hair and one eyebrow, it's my fault.

218
00:12:44,810 --> 00:12:46,880
They find him
tied to a street lamp...

219
00:12:47,152 --> 00:12:50,144
and big surprise,
everybody's looking at me.

220
00:12:51,124 --> 00:12:54,321
Charlie, you need to stop resenting
your brother just for being born.

221
00:12:54,679 --> 00:12:57,477
Hey, I don't resent him
for being born...

222
00:12:57,773 --> 00:12:59,923
but he abused the privilege.

223
00:13:00,198 --> 00:13:01,711
Even now, with you guys.

224
00:13:01,997 --> 00:13:04,147
I jumped through hoops
to get into this group.

225
00:13:04,464 --> 00:13:07,422
I had to be recommended,
then I had to get to know you guys.

226
00:13:07,725 --> 00:13:10,922
Now Alan thinks he can waltz right
in because he's my little brother?

227
00:13:11,238 --> 00:13:12,796
It's not fair.

228
00:13:13,496 --> 00:13:15,805
Let me tell you something about fair.

229
00:13:21,901 --> 00:13:23,619
What?

230
00:13:26,082 --> 00:13:30,234
Charlie, you know in your heart
the right thing to do.

231
00:13:31,686 --> 00:13:35,645
Fine. You want him so bad,
I'll get him.

232
00:13:36,662 --> 00:13:38,778
You know, Sean never speaks
about his siblings.

233
00:13:39,045 --> 00:13:40,717
All right, back off, Mary Poppins.

234
00:13:43,352 --> 00:13:46,025
You're working on my last nerve.

235
00:13:46,739 --> 00:13:51,130
Believe me, Alan, I understand how
hurtful it is to be rejected by Charlie.

236
00:13:51,883 --> 00:13:55,637
And I found that the only way to get
through it is to just love him more.

237
00:13:57,068 --> 00:14:01,664
That, and every so often, sneak into
his bedroom and try on his underwear.

238
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,312
Helpful tip.

239
00:14:08,066 --> 00:14:09,419
Hello.

240
00:14:09,655 --> 00:14:13,250
- Oh, hello, Charlie.
- Yeah, listen. I've been thinking.

241
00:14:13,585 --> 00:14:16,941
Why don't you take a Beano and come
back to the house and join the group.

242
00:14:17,558 --> 00:14:19,753
Oh, really?
What changed your mind?

243
00:14:20,652 --> 00:14:24,327
I had a small stroke. What difference
does it make? Get your ass back here.

244
00:14:24,708 --> 00:14:27,825
Well, did it occur to you that I might be
already otherwise engaged?

245
00:14:28,179 --> 00:14:30,852
- No.
- Well, I am.

246
00:14:31,148 --> 00:14:33,537
It would be inconvenient
for me to return right now.

247
00:14:33,866 --> 00:14:35,379
Why? Where are you?

248
00:14:36,124 --> 00:14:38,399
Where am I?
Well, that's none of your business.

249
00:14:42,104 --> 00:14:43,378
Are you in the garage?

250
00:14:44,445 --> 00:14:47,164
Oh, please. What on earth
would I be doing in the garage?

251
00:14:49,505 --> 00:14:50,824
Cut it out, Rose.

252
00:14:51,094 --> 00:14:54,291
You're being silly, Alan.
Charlie is reaching out to you.

253
00:14:54,648 --> 00:14:56,445
Yeah, right.
Last time he reached out...

254
00:14:56,697 --> 00:14:59,814
I wound up tied to a street lamp
on Wilshire Boulevard.

255
00:15:02,384 --> 00:15:04,454
All right. Are you gonna
come back inside...

256
00:15:04,726 --> 00:15:07,638
or do I have to drag you in
by your big, flappy monkey ears?

257
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:10,840
Listen to him, Alan. He's begging.

258
00:15:12,378 --> 00:15:17,088
No, thank you, Charlie. I am quite happy
chatting out here with Rose.

259
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:22,429
Okay. I tried to be the loving brother,
you sulky little weasel.

260
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:26,762
That really wasn't necessary, Alan.

261
00:15:27,056 --> 00:15:28,489
Yes, it was. You're my friend.

262
00:15:28,728 --> 00:15:33,483
And friends don't just abandon friends
because something better comes along.

263
00:15:36,381 --> 00:15:37,780
Then this might sting a bit.

264
00:15:40,144 --> 00:15:44,899
I have something else to do
and I'm pretty sure it's better.

265
00:15:49,636 --> 00:15:53,868
All right, I asked him nicely.
He said no. Let's move on.

266
00:15:54,236 --> 00:15:57,467
Coop, what's up with your fixation on
women who resemble Tobey Maguire?

267
00:15:59,003 --> 00:16:03,474
I think I finally got over that one.
I went to see Spider-Man 2. Nothing.

268
00:16:04,857 --> 00:16:08,054
Hi, everybody.
Thanks for the invite.

269
00:16:08,411 --> 00:16:10,049
I know I'm the new guy.

270
00:16:10,293 --> 00:16:13,171
So I'll hang back and
try not to disrupt the flow.

271
00:16:14,391 --> 00:16:17,144
So is there any protocols
I need to know about?

272
00:16:17,444 --> 00:16:21,357
Any customs, traditions,
a talking stick?

273
00:16:24,970 --> 00:16:26,847
No, there's no talking stick.

274
00:16:27,103 --> 00:16:29,492
But there is a "shut the hell up" shoe.

275
00:16:29,779 --> 00:16:32,452
Okey-doke. As you were.

276
00:16:33,710 --> 00:16:36,144
All right, I've got something
I wanna share.

277
00:16:37,013 --> 00:16:40,005
The panic attacks have come back,
and I just don't understand it.

278
00:16:40,317 --> 00:16:43,275
Everything is great.
My career, my marriage.

279
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:45,895
I should be on cloud nine
and instead of which...

280
00:16:46,171 --> 00:16:51,325
I've got this free-floating anxiety
and feeling of impending doom.

281
00:16:52,025 --> 00:16:54,175
And the diarrhea.

282
00:16:57,921 --> 00:17:02,199
Oh, I'm sorry. It's just that
my panic attacks come with diarrhea.

283
00:17:02,563 --> 00:17:07,717
First the clammy hands, and then the
nausea, and then the aforementioned...

284
00:17:09,003 --> 00:17:12,040
you know. Sorry.

285
00:17:16,237 --> 00:17:17,989
I changed my mind. I want him gone.

286
00:17:20,669 --> 00:17:23,661
Can we shave his head and
fill his mouth with hair first?

287
00:17:24,474 --> 00:17:27,307
Let me tell you something about hair.

288
00:17:29,367 --> 00:17:31,642
The clammy hands,
that's how it starts.

289
00:17:31,918 --> 00:17:34,386
Wait a minute.
You can't just kick him out like that.

290
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:36,789
You didn't want him here
in the first place.

291
00:17:37,437 --> 00:17:39,905
But I'm his brother.
It's my right to reject him.

292
00:17:40,197 --> 00:17:43,109
You guys wanted him. Now that
he's here, cut him a little slack.

293
00:17:43,459 --> 00:17:45,415
Can't you see?
He doesn't fit in here.

294
00:17:45,717 --> 00:17:48,629
Of course not.
He doesn't fit in anywhere.

295
00:17:48,937 --> 00:17:51,815
He's a weird little guy who
makes phone calls from the garage.

296
00:17:54,582 --> 00:17:56,493
It's not his fault.

297
00:17:56,756 --> 00:18:00,271
His big brother didn't look after him,
didn't teach him anything.

298
00:18:00,603 --> 00:18:02,594
I'm trying to make up for it
with his son...

299
00:18:02,861 --> 00:18:04,852
but this
annoying little ship has sailed.

300
00:18:07,294 --> 00:18:09,171
Thank you, Charlie.
You can stop now.

301
00:18:09,719 --> 00:18:12,916
No, I got your back.
I want this twerp in the group.

302
00:18:13,817 --> 00:18:15,728
A problem with that
is a problem with me.

303
00:18:16,033 --> 00:18:17,546
Oh, now you've got my back?

304
00:18:18,709 --> 00:18:20,461
- What?
- A little late, don't you think?

305
00:18:20,758 --> 00:18:21,873
Alan, I'm defending you.

306
00:18:22,097 --> 00:18:24,611
And I'm asking where you've been
for the past 35 years.

307
00:18:25,233 --> 00:18:27,383
Let me tell you
what it was like growing up.

308
00:18:27,658 --> 00:18:29,011
Un-freaking-believable.

309
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:31,966
What it was like to look up to...
No, to worship someone...

310
00:18:32,258 --> 00:18:35,773
who on two occasions tried to
trade you for an underwater flashlight.

311
00:18:38,530 --> 00:18:39,929
It wasn't for keeps.

312
00:18:40,161 --> 00:18:42,197
No, no, no.
It's my turn now, Charlie.

313
00:18:42,461 --> 00:18:45,294
All I ever wanted was his approval,
his friendship.

314
00:18:45,597 --> 00:18:49,067
And all I ever got was my underwear
yanked up to the base of my skull.

315
00:18:51,451 --> 00:18:55,444
And the sad part is that
I looked forward to the wedgies...

316
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:58,997
because it was the only form of love
that I could get from him.

317
00:19:03,494 --> 00:19:05,212
- That is sad, Charlie.
- It's terrible.

318
00:19:06,087 --> 00:19:09,762
Charlie, don't you think there's something
you have to say to your brother?

319
00:19:11,188 --> 00:19:12,621
Yeah.

320
00:19:16,164 --> 00:19:17,199
Come here, buddy.

321
00:19:21,475 --> 00:19:23,386
Okay, buddy.

322
00:19:32,974 --> 00:19:36,683
Here's the gag

323
00:19:37,030 --> 00:19:41,228
In the words of some wag

324
00:19:43,512 --> 00:19:48,347
She loves my flag

325
00:19:51,917 --> 00:19:58,914
Rally round the flag

326
00:20:02,914 --> 00:20:06,543
Wow, Elvis, that was beautiful.

327
00:20:07,681 --> 00:20:10,673
But, you know, in all honesty...

328
00:20:10,985 --> 00:20:14,057
I really loved your earlier,
you know, angrier stuff.

329
00:20:14,372 --> 00:20:16,886
You know, "Pump It Up."
Now, that was a song.

330
00:20:19,934 --> 00:20:21,765
I gave you that.

331
00:20:23,070 --> 00:20:25,061
Oh, and while we're
on the subject, Sean...

332
00:20:25,328 --> 00:20:27,558
why don't you
do funny stuff like you used to?

333
00:20:27,837 --> 00:20:29,714
I mean, Fast Times ruled, man.

334
00:20:29,969 --> 00:20:32,483
Come on, do a little Spicoli for us.

335
00:20:34,862 --> 00:20:38,616
Guys, this isn't funny.

336
00:20:41,092 --> 00:20:44,721
Clammy hands. Nausea.

337
00:20:45,065 --> 00:20:46,703
Guys?

338
00:20:47,657 --> 00:20:49,136
Hey, guys?

339
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:51,587
Guys?
