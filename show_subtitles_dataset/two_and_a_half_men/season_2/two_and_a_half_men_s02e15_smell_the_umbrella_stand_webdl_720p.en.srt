1
00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:05,388
Well, this is gonna be
a sucky weekend.

2
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:09,872
Try spending it with an 11 -year-old
who does nothing but complain.

3
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:12,362
You mean me?

4
00:00:12,616 --> 00:00:15,688
Boy, no wonder they got to
write your name in your underwear.

5
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:19,325
What am I supposed to do?

6
00:00:19,596 --> 00:00:21,712
- Watch TV.
- There's nothing on.

7
00:00:21,978 --> 00:00:24,094
- Play a video game.
- I've played them all.

8
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:26,237
- Read a book.
- Yeah, right.

9
00:00:26,492 --> 00:00:28,164
Who's the moron now?

10
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:32,941
Okay. Here's a rainy day activity.

11
00:00:33,263 --> 00:00:36,335
There are 12 college basketball games on
this weekend.

12
00:00:36,648 --> 00:00:38,684
Dial this number, and ask for Coop.

13
00:00:38,988 --> 00:00:42,822
Tell him you're calling for Mr. Bojingles
and write down everything he tells you.

14
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:44,962
Do I get to make
some picks this time?

15
00:00:45,258 --> 00:00:48,216
- You got money?
- Lf you pay me what you owe me.

16
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:51,517
Well, you're getting an education here.
That's priceless.

17
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:56,357
- What's going on?
- Just talking about picking colleges.

18
00:00:56,709 --> 00:00:59,064
- I like Duke.
- Over Wake Forest?

19
00:00:59,384 --> 00:01:01,022
Got a hunch.

20
00:01:01,933 --> 00:01:03,730
You've got him thinking about college?

21
00:01:04,023 --> 00:01:07,538
You're welcome.
So how'd it go at the doctor?

22
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:10,531
Sit down,
I have to tell you something.

23
00:01:10,794 --> 00:01:12,307
What?

24
00:01:15,099 --> 00:01:16,930
The doctor wants me
to have a procedure.

25
00:01:17,564 --> 00:01:19,600
- What kind of procedure?
- He says I'm fine...

26
00:01:19,863 --> 00:01:22,935
and it's routine,
but I'm really freaked out about it.

27
00:01:23,290 --> 00:01:24,803
What procedure?

28
00:01:25,505 --> 00:01:26,938
A colonoscopy.

29
00:01:27,219 --> 00:01:29,813
Oh, jeez, Alan, that's no big deal.

30
00:01:30,103 --> 00:01:32,776
They're just gonna shove
a camera up your ass.

31
00:01:34,784 --> 00:01:37,582
Okay, in all future references
to this procedure...

32
00:01:37,876 --> 00:01:42,552
can we please use
the word "glide" or "slide"...

33
00:01:42,934 --> 00:01:45,164
as opposed to "shove."

34
00:01:45,483 --> 00:01:48,281
Don't sweat it. Every guy eventually
has to get one of those.

35
00:01:48,576 --> 00:01:51,170
- It's strictly a fact-finding mission.
- You've had one?

36
00:01:51,501 --> 00:01:52,820
No, you crazy?

37
00:01:53,048 --> 00:01:56,245
But I hear there's nothing
to worry about. It's a tiny little camera.

38
00:01:56,558 --> 00:01:59,197
In the old days, they'd send
a sketch artist up there.

39
00:02:01,407 --> 00:02:03,125
Besides, you're unconscious.

40
00:02:03,413 --> 00:02:07,088
That's what I'm worried about.
I'll be in a very vulnerable position.

41
00:02:07,425 --> 00:02:10,781
- They could do anything.
- Alan, it's not a pirate ship.

42
00:02:12,398 --> 00:02:14,673
Just relax.
It'll be over before you know it.

43
00:02:14,948 --> 00:02:17,940
Yeah. I'll bet that's what they say
on pirate ships.

44
00:02:50,766 --> 00:02:52,165
- Damn it.
- What?

45
00:02:52,396 --> 00:02:53,909
The sink's stopped up again.

46
00:02:54,151 --> 00:02:57,382
That kid doesn't know the difference
between the garbage and the drain.

47
00:02:58,205 --> 00:03:00,924
- What do you want? He's 11.
- That's no excuse.

48
00:03:01,214 --> 00:03:04,809
If he can't tell which hole is which
at his age, he's headed for trouble.

49
00:03:26,876 --> 00:03:28,548
How about that?

50
00:03:29,216 --> 00:03:31,571
Oh, God, I had the worst nightmares.

51
00:03:31,849 --> 00:03:33,441
Pirate ships?

52
00:03:33,688 --> 00:03:35,440
Full-service gas stations.

53
00:03:36,321 --> 00:03:37,959
I fail to see the connection.

54
00:03:38,536 --> 00:03:42,006
Cold steel nozzles
going into openings.

55
00:03:43,593 --> 00:03:45,743
Dipsticks being pulled out.

56
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:49,038
Do I have to draw you a picture?

57
00:03:49,654 --> 00:03:50,928
You know what?

58
00:03:51,158 --> 00:03:53,353
You need to get your mind off
this colonoscopy.

59
00:03:53,666 --> 00:03:56,897
Come on! Get in there, you sucker!

60
00:04:04,365 --> 00:04:06,560
Easy for you to say.

61
00:04:07,333 --> 00:04:08,607
How about this?

62
00:04:08,837 --> 00:04:11,829
How about we hop in the car
and go to Vegas for a couple of days?

63
00:04:12,473 --> 00:04:13,952
Just like that? What about Jake?

64
00:04:14,229 --> 00:04:16,379
Oh, yeah, Jake.

65
00:04:16,653 --> 00:04:19,850
Okay, how about this, we get him
a fake mustache and a hat...

66
00:04:20,163 --> 00:04:22,552
and tell everybody his mother
was a heavy smoker.

67
00:04:23,716 --> 00:04:25,752
- I don't think so.
- We can still bring him...

68
00:04:26,015 --> 00:04:28,734
come on, it's the perfect solution.
The kid's bored...

69
00:04:29,024 --> 00:04:31,697
and you're all puckered up
over this colonoscopy thing.

70
00:04:32,033 --> 00:04:36,185
It just won't go in.

71
00:04:39,598 --> 00:04:42,351
- Well, it is a three-day weekend.
- Exactly.

72
00:04:42,649 --> 00:04:46,358
And I got 2 grand in my pocket that's
itching to turn into $ 12 and a hangover.

73
00:04:47,455 --> 00:04:49,844
Come on, we can be there
in like four hours.

74
00:04:50,130 --> 00:04:52,439
Unless you drive,
in which case I'm not going.

75
00:04:52,763 --> 00:04:54,321
Perfect, now I can't get it out.

76
00:04:57,653 --> 00:04:59,689
You know what? Why not?
One way or another...

77
00:04:59,951 --> 00:05:02,784
I'm gonna get reamed.
I might as well enjoy a free buffet.

78
00:05:03,128 --> 00:05:05,881
Great. Go grab a toothbrush
and we'll hit the road.

79
00:05:13,326 --> 00:05:15,237
Pinky? Berta.

80
00:05:15,499 --> 00:05:19,538
Order a keg and call the gang,
I got the house until Tuesday.

81
00:05:20,222 --> 00:05:21,735
Okay, we're gonna need two rooms.

82
00:05:21,977 --> 00:05:23,808
One for Alan Harper and son...

83
00:05:24,067 --> 00:05:27,980
and one for Charlie Harper and
a cocktail waitress to be named later.

84
00:05:29,834 --> 00:05:31,506
No, I don't want connecting rooms.

85
00:05:31,757 --> 00:05:33,748
Weren't you listening?

86
00:05:34,056 --> 00:05:36,729
In fact, put mine on a different floor.

87
00:05:37,065 --> 00:05:38,942
Come on, let's go.

88
00:05:39,238 --> 00:05:41,672
Now, what's playing
in your showroom?

89
00:05:41,955 --> 00:05:44,788
Nude Legends on Ice. Sweet.

90
00:05:45,131 --> 00:05:47,122
Okay, this may
sound like a dumb question...

91
00:05:47,388 --> 00:05:49,379
but is it a family show?

92
00:05:51,526 --> 00:05:54,598
Well, what if the kid had a mustache?

93
00:05:56,039 --> 00:05:59,714
All right. He'll just have to stay in
the room and watch scrambled porn.

94
00:06:02,601 --> 00:06:05,752
- You could help me, you know.
- No, you're doing okay.

95
00:06:07,574 --> 00:06:10,532
- Where's your clean underwear?
- I'm wearing it.

96
00:06:11,336 --> 00:06:14,373
- That's all you brought for the weekend?
- It's only three days.

97
00:06:15,139 --> 00:06:17,016
All right, we'll pick some up there.

98
00:06:17,313 --> 00:06:19,588
They'd last five days
if I turn them inside out.

99
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:25,842
What's going on? Aren't you ready?

100
00:06:26,089 --> 00:06:28,523
- I'm packing Jake.
- For what, college?

101
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:32,255
- What the hell's this?
- So he can go swimming.

102
00:06:32,567 --> 00:06:35,923
- Where?
- They have pools in Vegas, Charlie.

103
00:06:36,998 --> 00:06:40,468
Why don't you bring a frying pan,
they got kitchens too.

104
00:06:40,843 --> 00:06:44,074
- Let's see. Sport jacket.
- He doesn't need a sport jacket.

105
00:06:44,395 --> 00:06:46,272
What if we take him someplace nice?

106
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:47,960
Take him someplace nice?

107
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:51,277
Alan, if I wanna throw away money,
I'll play keno.

108
00:06:52,044 --> 00:06:54,478
- Can I gamble in Vegas?
- No.

109
00:06:54,802 --> 00:06:57,270
- Why am I going?
- Because all the kennels are full.

110
00:06:59,859 --> 00:07:01,497
Now, come on. Let's go.

111
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:05,494
- Charlie, I haven't packed myself yet.
- What've you been doing?

112
00:07:05,877 --> 00:07:07,390
I changed the phone message...

113
00:07:07,633 --> 00:07:10,943
to tell people we'd be out of town,
I put together a first aid kit...

114
00:07:11,269 --> 00:07:14,864
I turned the fridge thermostat down,
because it doesn't have to be cold...

115
00:07:15,239 --> 00:07:17,707
I called the paper
and stopped delivery...

116
00:07:17,998 --> 00:07:19,829
and I erased an old Mad Libs book...

117
00:07:20,087 --> 00:07:22,555
so we'd have something
to entertain us in the car.

118
00:07:23,891 --> 00:07:25,085
- Mad Libs, huh?
- Yeah.

119
00:07:25,312 --> 00:07:26,711
Let me see that.

120
00:07:26,942 --> 00:07:29,661
Go get packed!

121
00:07:34,423 --> 00:07:36,061
Wait until you see Vegas, Jake.

122
00:07:36,304 --> 00:07:40,343
There's action everywhere you look,
24 hours a day, seven days a week.

123
00:07:40,734 --> 00:07:42,167
How does that help me?

124
00:07:42,406 --> 00:07:45,284
I can't gamble,
and I have to be in bed at 9:30.

125
00:07:45,582 --> 00:07:48,255
Hey, when we go to Disneyland
do I complain that I hate...

126
00:07:48,549 --> 00:07:52,428
every aspect of the entire experience?
- Yeah.

127
00:07:55,362 --> 00:07:57,717
Well, then you know how irritating it is.

128
00:07:59,416 --> 00:08:01,247
- Blackjack.
- That's it?

129
00:08:01,547 --> 00:08:03,219
Yep. You owe me another dollar.

130
00:08:04,515 --> 00:08:06,551
- This stinks.
- You wanna quit?

131
00:08:06,855 --> 00:08:08,607
Just deal the cards.

132
00:08:08,903 --> 00:08:11,463
Attaboy.

133
00:08:12,288 --> 00:08:14,006
Uncle Charlie, what's a colonoscopy?

134
00:08:15,172 --> 00:08:17,766
- Didn't your dad tell you?
- He said it was just a test...

135
00:08:18,056 --> 00:08:20,251
and it was no big deal,
so I looked it up.

136
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:24,250
- And?
- I don't believe it.

137
00:08:24,994 --> 00:08:26,985
Believe it.

138
00:08:27,585 --> 00:08:30,657
Wouldn't it be easier to go in
the other way?

139
00:08:32,977 --> 00:08:36,174
- You'd think, but no.
- Why do they have to do it?

140
00:08:36,529 --> 00:08:40,602
- They just wanna see what's going on.
- Did Dad lose something?

141
00:08:42,965 --> 00:08:47,322
Because when I swallowed 35 cents,
we just waited for it to come out.

142
00:08:48,357 --> 00:08:52,270
- No kidding.
- Yeah, but I only got 30 cents back.

143
00:08:54,166 --> 00:08:56,396
Well, the house always takes a cut.

144
00:08:59,307 --> 00:09:01,901
- What're you gonna do?
- Hit me.

145
00:09:02,232 --> 00:09:04,302
Okay, okay.
In Vegas, you don't say, "Hit me."

146
00:09:04,573 --> 00:09:06,404
If you want a card, you go like this.

147
00:09:06,704 --> 00:09:08,296
Okay, fine.

148
00:09:11,511 --> 00:09:15,220
- Busted. You owe me another dollar.
- What if I didn't want another card?

149
00:09:15,941 --> 00:09:17,499
You go like this.

150
00:09:18,156 --> 00:09:20,067
That's what I meant to do.

151
00:09:21,667 --> 00:09:24,135
There's no do-overs in Vegas.

152
00:09:24,467 --> 00:09:26,662
What's the signal
to go to the bathroom?

153
00:09:26,975 --> 00:09:29,205
There is no signal,
you just get up and go.

154
00:09:29,482 --> 00:09:32,838
Unless you're on a hot streak,
in which case you sit and wet yourself.

155
00:09:33,202 --> 00:09:36,558
- You're kidding, right?
- You're wearing a $50 pair of slacks...

156
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:39,269
and you got $600 on the table,
do the math.

157
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:43,337
I have to do math and pee my pants?

158
00:09:47,663 --> 00:09:48,891
Alan, are you ready yet?

159
00:09:49,167 --> 00:09:50,441
Just about.

160
00:09:50,714 --> 00:09:54,673
- And where'd I get the $600?
- You've been saying that for 20 minutes.

161
00:09:55,019 --> 00:09:58,136
- What are you doing?
- Financial planning.

162
00:09:59,867 --> 00:10:02,097
I don't wanna look, but I gotta.

163
00:10:03,963 --> 00:10:07,080
In class, if we have to go the bathroom,
we do this or this.

164
00:10:07,390 --> 00:10:10,746
- Get it?
- Yeah. I got it.

165
00:10:13,032 --> 00:10:16,263
Two hundred and eighty, 280, 280.

166
00:10:16,584 --> 00:10:19,542
- What the hell are you doing?
- Hang on. Two... Oh, thanks.

167
00:10:19,844 --> 00:10:22,039
Now you made me lose count.

168
00:10:23,062 --> 00:10:26,179
Ten, 10, 10.
Twenty, 20, 20.

169
00:10:26,490 --> 00:10:28,958
Stop it, stop it.
Why are you doing this?

170
00:10:29,666 --> 00:10:32,624
- I have a system.
- Do tell.

171
00:10:32,968 --> 00:10:35,880
I divide my gambling money
into three equal piles.

172
00:10:36,228 --> 00:10:37,980
The first one is for day one.

173
00:10:38,234 --> 00:10:39,747
That I'll put in my money belt.

174
00:10:40,407 --> 00:10:42,602
You're wearing a money belt?

175
00:10:42,873 --> 00:10:44,465
Oh, good, you can't tell.

176
00:10:44,712 --> 00:10:46,350
I was afraid it made me look chunky.

177
00:10:48,223 --> 00:10:51,898
Anyway, the second pile
is for day two. I'll give that to you...

178
00:10:52,235 --> 00:10:55,432
under no circumstances do you give
it back to me before midnight...

179
00:10:55,746 --> 00:10:57,623
which would be
the start of day two.

180
00:10:57,919 --> 00:11:01,514
Un-freaking-believable.
What's the last pile for?

181
00:11:02,474 --> 00:11:04,146
That's the most important pile.

182
00:11:04,397 --> 00:11:08,549
That's the money I hide
in my Frye boot.

183
00:11:09,412 --> 00:11:13,849
- In your boot?
- But I pretend that I don't have it...

184
00:11:14,219 --> 00:11:17,291
so that if disaster strikes
and I've lost piles one and two...

185
00:11:17,604 --> 00:11:21,563
then I can pull it out,
and poof, I'm solvent again.

186
00:11:22,995 --> 00:11:25,429
- Okay. I think I understand.
- Pretty clever, huh?

187
00:11:25,754 --> 00:11:27,073
Yeah. That's a nice boot.

188
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:29,097
- Let me see it.
- Oh, sure.

189
00:11:29,348 --> 00:11:32,579
Get dressed and let's go!

190
00:11:48,281 --> 00:11:50,033
Okay.

191
00:11:50,956 --> 00:11:54,028
- Twenty-one!
- Turn over your hole card.

192
00:11:55,595 --> 00:11:57,426
Oh, 27.

193
00:11:57,726 --> 00:12:00,115
Close, 29.

194
00:12:00,945 --> 00:12:02,458
Okay, I'm good.

195
00:12:03,118 --> 00:12:05,427
Alrighty.

196
00:12:14,737 --> 00:12:17,171
Viva Las Vegas.

197
00:12:18,289 --> 00:12:20,439
- Oh, Alan.
- What?

198
00:12:20,755 --> 00:12:23,144
We're going in a Mercedes,
not a time machine.

199
00:12:25,937 --> 00:12:27,370
Should I change?

200
00:12:28,194 --> 00:12:30,867
You should, but after all these years,
I doubt you will.

201
00:12:35,049 --> 00:12:38,519
- What's this?
- Oh, toiletries, sundries, whatnot.

202
00:12:38,852 --> 00:12:41,161
- Really.
- Yeah, you'll thank me.

203
00:12:41,443 --> 00:12:43,718
Not all hotels supply shower caps
and sewing kits.

204
00:12:46,291 --> 00:12:48,327
Get in the car. Jake, come on.

205
00:12:48,590 --> 00:12:52,583
- Hold on a second.
- Oh, for God's sake. Now what?

206
00:12:57,785 --> 00:12:59,616
Okay, let's go.

207
00:13:06,227 --> 00:13:09,902
- Well, you don't have a fever.
- I told you, he's fine. Let's go.

208
00:13:10,239 --> 00:13:13,390
Charlie, he threw up in
your umbrella stand. Did you miss that?

209
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:16,344
So? Vegas is full of people
who throw up.

210
00:13:18,264 --> 00:13:21,017
They built that city on a sea of vomit.

211
00:13:21,858 --> 00:13:24,418
- I'm okay, I can go.
- That's the spirit.

212
00:13:24,742 --> 00:13:28,701
You wanna drive five hours with a
puking kid in the back of your Mercedes?

213
00:13:29,089 --> 00:13:32,479
He can stick his head out the window.
Let the guy behind us worry.

214
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:35,772
- We're not going.
- Oh, come on.

215
00:13:36,026 --> 00:13:38,256
- It's probably just something he ate.
- All right.

216
00:13:38,534 --> 00:13:40,365
What have you eaten
in the last 24 hours?

217
00:13:40,624 --> 00:13:43,058
Well, let's see,
two bowls of Cocoa Puffs...

218
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:47,174
a couple blueberry Pop-Tarts,
bag of string cheese.

219
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:50,159
That reminds me,
we need more string cheese.

220
00:13:50,445 --> 00:13:54,154
Then, for lunch, a Hot Pocket
and a Bagel Bite.

221
00:13:54,499 --> 00:14:00,131
Then dinner, fried chicken, mashed
potatoes and a baloney sandwich.

222
00:14:01,019 --> 00:14:02,372
Okay, it's not what he ate.

223
00:14:04,154 --> 00:14:07,146
Then, for a snack, I had a glass of Tang
and some Cheetos.

224
00:14:07,497 --> 00:14:09,886
That explains the orange vomit.

225
00:14:10,214 --> 00:14:11,613
It's probably a stomach virus.

226
00:14:11,886 --> 00:14:13,638
Oh, please. I throw up all the time.

227
00:14:13,892 --> 00:14:17,168
It's just nature's way of saying,
"Everybody out of the pool."

228
00:14:17,528 --> 00:14:20,281
- I'm putting him to bed. Come on.
- They have beds in Vegas.

229
00:14:20,579 --> 00:14:23,377
- What if he needs a doctor?
- They have doctors in Vegas.

230
00:14:23,672 --> 00:14:27,142
I bet if we looked around, we could find
a casino with a hospital theme.

231
00:14:27,517 --> 00:14:30,714
You know, Caesars Sinai
or something.

232
00:14:32,323 --> 00:14:34,041
I'll get it.

233
00:14:36,252 --> 00:14:37,970
Hello? Hey, Mom.

234
00:14:38,885 --> 00:14:41,115
Fine. Nothing.

235
00:14:41,434 --> 00:14:43,584
I threw up in Uncle Charlie's
umbrella stand...

236
00:14:43,858 --> 00:14:47,248
and we're going to Vegas.
- No!

237
00:14:48,121 --> 00:14:49,873
What kind of a father are you?

238
00:14:50,169 --> 00:14:52,967
I am a good father.
When he threw up, I cancelled the trip.

239
00:14:53,304 --> 00:14:56,057
But you were planning to take
my 11 -year-old to Las Vegas.

240
00:14:56,773 --> 00:14:59,162
It's really a family town now.

241
00:15:00,701 --> 00:15:04,216
The mob hardly has
any influence at all anymore.

242
00:15:04,546 --> 00:15:06,901
Oh, good, Charlie. That helps.

243
00:15:07,221 --> 00:15:09,212
Were you planning on
telling me about this?

244
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:11,875
What happens in Vegas
stays in Vegas, Mom.

245
00:15:13,741 --> 00:15:15,413
Oh, good, Jake. That helps.

246
00:15:16,709 --> 00:15:19,781
- Honey, why don't you go lie down.
- Why? I'm fine.

247
00:15:20,136 --> 00:15:22,252
Is it too late to get our bets down
with Coop?

248
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,278
- What bets?
- Who's Coop?

249
00:15:24,566 --> 00:15:27,160
Go lie down. You're delirious.

250
00:15:29,581 --> 00:15:33,574
Listen, Judith, I don't think
you understand what's going on here.

251
00:15:33,970 --> 00:15:35,289
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

252
00:15:35,558 --> 00:15:37,628
- You see, this trip was my idea.
- I'm shocked.

253
00:15:37,898 --> 00:15:39,854
Let me finish.

254
00:15:40,113 --> 00:15:41,910
You see, I wanted to cheer Alan up...

255
00:15:42,203 --> 00:15:44,194
Charlie, don't. It's personal.

256
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:45,779
She has a right to know.

257
00:15:46,424 --> 00:15:49,336
Judith, Alan got some bad news
from the doctor yesterday.

258
00:15:49,684 --> 00:15:51,879
Oh, my God, Alan. What is it?

259
00:15:52,150 --> 00:15:57,099
Well, the doctor says
I have to have a colonoscopy.

260
00:15:57,542 --> 00:16:00,932
- Are you having problems?
- No, it's just routine.

261
00:16:01,303 --> 00:16:05,774
- So?
- So I'm really nervous about it.

262
00:16:06,193 --> 00:16:07,467
That's it?

263
00:16:08,074 --> 00:16:11,669
Well, it's a long, snaky thing
with a camera.

264
00:16:12,044 --> 00:16:14,114
Oh, please. Your son was
10 pounds at birth...

265
00:16:14,385 --> 00:16:16,376
and his head was
the same size it is now.

266
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:19,589
That's kind of apples and oranges,
isn't it?

267
00:16:19,901 --> 00:16:21,812
- Goodbye, Alan.
- Wait, wait, wait, Judith.

268
00:16:22,075 --> 00:16:25,431
- Aren't you gonna take Jake with you?
- No, I'm not taking him. He's fine.

269
00:16:25,753 --> 00:16:29,428
Don't think I don't see what's going.
You put Jake up to telling me he's sick...

270
00:16:29,765 --> 00:16:32,359
so you could pawn him off
while you went to Las Vegas.

271
00:16:32,690 --> 00:16:35,045
He did throw up.
Smell the umbrella stand.

272
00:16:35,365 --> 00:16:37,435
I'm not buying it.
I'll get him Monday night.

273
00:16:37,706 --> 00:16:39,617
And if I find out
you took him to Vegas...

274
00:16:39,879 --> 00:16:42,188
you'll get a colonoscopy
from my attorney.

275
00:16:44,435 --> 00:16:47,188
I've seen your alimony checks.

276
00:16:47,486 --> 00:16:49,636
You already got one.

277
00:16:52,877 --> 00:16:54,390
So, what's the deal?
Are we going?

278
00:16:54,674 --> 00:16:56,744
- I don't think so.
- Why? I'm fine.

279
00:16:57,057 --> 00:17:00,527
- Yeah, but your mom said, "No."
- Oh, man.

280
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:03,294
Don't eat anything orange.

281
00:17:04,412 --> 00:17:07,165
- You wanna know what I think?
- Not at all.

282
00:17:07,505 --> 00:17:09,735
I think if she wanted to
keep you on a leash...

283
00:17:10,013 --> 00:17:13,608
she shouldn't have divorced you.
- I'm not on a leash. I never was.

284
00:17:13,941 --> 00:17:15,693
You were living here
for three weeks...

285
00:17:15,947 --> 00:17:18,984
before you were getting up
on the couch without permission.

286
00:17:19,751 --> 00:17:21,742
Can we just drop it?
It was a bad idea.

287
00:17:22,049 --> 00:17:25,883
There are no bad ideas. There's just
a lack of will to execute them.

288
00:17:27,608 --> 00:17:30,076
We're men, Alan. Single men.

289
00:17:30,408 --> 00:17:33,286
We go where we want, when we want
and how we want.

290
00:17:33,585 --> 00:17:35,416
Usually without so much toiletries...

291
00:17:35,674 --> 00:17:39,144
but I'm trying to be flexible here.
- I explained about the toiletries.

292
00:17:39,519 --> 00:17:42,795
The point is, you can't let your ex-wife
control your behavior...

293
00:17:43,114 --> 00:17:45,674
no matter how stupid
or self-destructive it might be.

294
00:17:45,956 --> 00:17:48,675
- Charlie, l...
- What profit a man...

295
00:17:49,007 --> 00:17:51,726
if he escapes the iron shackles
of matrimony...

296
00:17:52,016 --> 00:17:57,249
only to surrender to sexually frustrated
tyranny of a vengeful ex-wife?

297
00:18:01,002 --> 00:18:02,401
You know what? You're right.

298
00:18:02,632 --> 00:18:04,224
- We're men.
- Right, are you with me?

299
00:18:04,512 --> 00:18:07,026
- I'm with you.
- Grab your pack, we're going to Vegas.

300
00:18:09,068 --> 00:18:11,662
- Jake?
- Just a sec.

301
00:18:14,710 --> 00:18:17,065
It's okay. It's mostly water.

302
00:18:21,314 --> 00:18:24,431
I'm fine. Let's go. We're men.

303
00:18:24,741 --> 00:18:26,493
Nope. You're too sick.

304
00:18:26,747 --> 00:18:28,544
Some other time.

305
00:18:28,795 --> 00:18:31,150
I'm really sorry I ruined the trip,
Uncle Charlie.

306
00:18:31,470 --> 00:18:32,789
Hey, it's not your fault.

307
00:18:33,016 --> 00:18:34,847
It's your dad who won't let you go.

308
00:18:36,443 --> 00:18:39,003
- Thanks, Charlie.
- Why should he feel guilty?

309
00:18:39,954 --> 00:18:42,991
Here. Put this on Wake Forest.

310
00:18:45,136 --> 00:18:47,366
Game's over, Jake. They lost.

311
00:18:47,686 --> 00:18:51,565
- What about the spread?
- They didn't cover.

312
00:18:53,328 --> 00:18:54,602
Give me back my money.

313
00:18:57,257 --> 00:18:58,610
Get some rest.

314
00:18:58,845 --> 00:19:01,962
- I'm hungry.
- Get used to it.

315
00:19:04,654 --> 00:19:07,327
- That's some great kid.
- Yeah.

316
00:19:07,622 --> 00:19:10,420
Sick as a dog,
and all he wants is a little action.

317
00:19:10,714 --> 00:19:12,306
Well, he gets that from you.

318
00:19:12,595 --> 00:19:13,869
You think so?

319
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:17,979
- Because I do try to be a role model.
- I know you do.

320
00:19:18,363 --> 00:19:21,036
Listen, there's no reason
you have to stick around.

321
00:19:21,330 --> 00:19:23,241
He's gonna sleep.
I can keep an eye on him.

322
00:19:23,545 --> 00:19:25,263
No, no, I couldn't go now.

323
00:19:25,551 --> 00:19:27,826
Why not? You wanted to go to Vegas.
You should go.

324
00:19:28,101 --> 00:19:31,093
You're probably gonna have a better time
without Jake and me.

325
00:19:31,444 --> 00:19:33,674
Probably? Unquestionably.

326
00:19:33,994 --> 00:19:36,064
- Then why don't you go?
- I don't know.

327
00:19:36,334 --> 00:19:39,485
It just feels somehow wrong
to abandon the kid when he's sick.

328
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:42,200
Now you know what it feels like
to be a parent.

329
00:19:43,648 --> 00:19:45,684
How inconvenient.

330
00:19:46,825 --> 00:19:50,818
- What's that?
- It sounds like Lynyrd Skynyrd.

331
00:20:01,829 --> 00:20:03,501
Berta?

332
00:20:08,098 --> 00:20:10,009
Surprise!

333
00:20:20,803 --> 00:20:22,282
I'm gonna start the IV.

334
00:20:22,517 --> 00:20:24,473
In a few seconds,
you're gonna feel drowsy.

335
00:20:24,732 --> 00:20:27,804
No. No drowsy.
I wanna be out. Completely out.

336
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:29,751
Don't worry, you will be.

337
00:20:29,998 --> 00:20:32,512
- Right, doctor?
- Aye.

338
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:36,958
You won't be remembering anything,
me bucko.

339
00:20:45,211 --> 00:20:48,601
Thanks, doc. Here's the 2 grand
for your children's hospital.

340
00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:53,780
And remember, when he wakes up,
you're a gas station attendant.
