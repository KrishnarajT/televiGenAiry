1
00:00:05,170 --> 00:00:06,842
Here. This is for you.

2
00:00:09,646 --> 00:00:11,284
Thank you.

3
00:00:11,988 --> 00:00:14,297
And I didn't get you anything.

4
00:00:15,544 --> 00:00:16,863
It's your kid's toilet seat.

5
00:00:17,091 --> 00:00:19,651
It's obviously in his way,
and I'm tired of cleaning it.

6
00:00:20,939 --> 00:00:22,338
Oh, come on, Berta.

7
00:00:22,571 --> 00:00:24,801
- He's 11.
- He's a pig.

8
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:26,564
I'll talk to him.

9
00:00:26,796 --> 00:00:28,787
While you're at it,
you may wanna mention...

10
00:00:29,054 --> 00:00:31,284
the half-eaten egg salad sandwiches
in his toy chest...

11
00:00:31,564 --> 00:00:33,236
the dead marine life
at the back of the closet...

12
00:00:33,488 --> 00:00:35,683
and the booger collection
under the bed.

13
00:00:35,956 --> 00:00:37,912
I'll do my best
to address your concerns.

14
00:00:38,173 --> 00:00:41,165
Don't condescend to me, Zippy.
I'll snap you like a butter bean.

15
00:00:43,151 --> 00:00:44,982
Excuse me. Is one of you Alan?

16
00:00:51,851 --> 00:00:53,125
I'm Alan.

17
00:00:53,608 --> 00:00:56,042
Oh, good.
Charlie wants you to come upstairs.

18
00:00:56,620 --> 00:01:00,533
- Why?
- Well, it's kind of hard to explain.

19
00:01:00,886 --> 00:01:03,525
- Try.
- Oh, yeah, try.

20
00:01:04,483 --> 00:01:05,916
Well, he's kind of stuck.

21
00:01:09,545 --> 00:01:10,819
- In what?
- In what?

22
00:01:11,469 --> 00:01:14,302
Not in anything, just stuck.

23
00:01:14,899 --> 00:01:16,935
Would you hurry?

24
00:01:20,127 --> 00:01:23,278
- Where are you going?
- Oh, like I'm gonna miss this?

25
00:01:28,368 --> 00:01:30,518
Charlie? Are you okay?

26
00:01:30,794 --> 00:01:33,945
Do I look okay?

27
00:01:34,265 --> 00:01:38,895
- What happened?
- I pulled my back.

28
00:01:39,285 --> 00:01:42,277
I didn't do anything. I was lying there
and he started screaming.

29
00:01:42,589 --> 00:01:45,422
- I understand.
- I mean, I wasn't just lying there.

30
00:01:45,727 --> 00:01:48,799
- I got it.
- Damn, I wish I had a camera.

31
00:01:49,115 --> 00:01:51,948
That's okay. It's all on video.

32
00:02:04,257 --> 00:02:07,329
Alan, you're a chiropractor.
Do something.

33
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:09,857
Really? You want my help?

34
00:02:10,113 --> 00:02:12,832
Even after you referred to
my profession as, what was it...

35
00:02:13,124 --> 00:02:14,716
"urban voodoo"?

36
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,910
I'm sorry. Now help me.

37
00:02:18,186 --> 00:02:20,097
Okay. Okay.
We'll see what we can do.

38
00:02:25,255 --> 00:02:27,405
Yeah, yeah, okay,
very funny, very funny.

39
00:02:27,681 --> 00:02:30,241
Hold on.
Berta, I'm gonna need a dead rooster.

40
00:02:31,027 --> 00:02:32,665
Check your kid's room.

41
00:02:33,411 --> 00:02:36,289
Excuse me, Charlie, sorry you're
not feeling well, but I have an audition.

42
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:39,787
- Go.
- It's a Wheat Thins commercial.

43
00:02:40,439 --> 00:02:43,397
- I'm an actress.
- Of course you are.

44
00:02:44,329 --> 00:02:45,603
I had a nice time, Charlie.

45
00:02:46,295 --> 00:02:47,853
- I'll call you.
- Great.

46
00:02:48,093 --> 00:02:50,084
Oh, if you find my tongue stud,
let me know.

47
00:02:52,904 --> 00:02:55,020
Okay, let's see what we've got here.

48
00:02:55,790 --> 00:02:58,179
- Is this tender?
- A little.

49
00:02:58,467 --> 00:03:01,220
- On a scale of one to ten?
- I don't know. Three?

50
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:04,478
- Okay, what about this?
- Four.

51
00:03:04,783 --> 00:03:07,013
And what about this?

52
00:03:09,133 --> 00:03:11,283
I'm gonna need a number, Charlie.

53
00:03:11,936 --> 00:03:14,086
No, no, I changed my mind.
Leave me alone.

54
00:03:14,362 --> 00:03:16,398
Oh, don't be a baby.

55
00:03:16,663 --> 00:03:18,574
- Stay away.
- I have to examine you.

56
00:03:18,838 --> 00:03:21,033
- It's okay. I'm better.
- No, you're not.

57
00:03:21,306 --> 00:03:24,184
- Now, stop moving.
- Really, I'm fine. Just don't...

58
00:03:27,245 --> 00:03:30,920
Ten. Ten. That's a ten.

59
00:03:31,512 --> 00:03:34,390
- Are you happy?
- Do I look happy?

60
00:03:35,109 --> 00:03:37,669
Let's get you back on the bed
so I can give you an adjustment.

61
00:03:37,953 --> 00:03:39,227
No, no, no, no. New plan.

62
00:03:39,459 --> 00:03:41,336
I need someone
who can give me drugs.

63
00:03:41,593 --> 00:03:44,471
I'm not holding,
but I can make a couple calls.

64
00:03:44,772 --> 00:03:46,410
Drugs just mask the problem.

65
00:03:46,654 --> 00:03:49,851
Fine, mask it. Throw a cape on it,
and let it fight crime.

66
00:03:50,167 --> 00:03:51,998
I just want it to go away.

67
00:03:52,259 --> 00:03:55,774
Good news. I think I know where
Wheat Thins lost her tongue stud.

68
00:04:01,587 --> 00:04:02,986
For the love of God.

69
00:04:04,222 --> 00:04:07,214
Oh, mommy.

70
00:04:10,831 --> 00:04:12,423
Feeling better?

71
00:04:12,713 --> 00:04:15,546
No, I just passed out for a second.

72
00:04:17,649 --> 00:04:19,640
Berta, I'm gonna take Charlie
to the doctor.

73
00:04:19,908 --> 00:04:22,138
- You keep an eye on Jake.
- Fine.

74
00:04:22,418 --> 00:04:24,056
Whoa, hey.

75
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:26,416
And please put his toilet seat back on.

76
00:04:31,202 --> 00:04:33,432
I really think you should
put on your seat belt.

77
00:04:33,879 --> 00:04:35,915
Do you now?

78
00:04:36,347 --> 00:04:40,056
Did you forget it took three of us
just to put on my shorts?

79
00:04:40,404 --> 00:04:43,919
Suit yourself. I should call your doctor
and tell him we're coming.

80
00:04:44,252 --> 00:04:46,482
- What's his number?
- I don't know.

81
00:04:46,762 --> 00:04:51,358
All right, I'll call directory assistance.
What's his name? Where's he located?

82
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:54,208
Dr. Schwartz. Beverly Hills.

83
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:59,129
- You're kidding, right?
- Do I look like I'm kidding?

84
00:05:00,105 --> 00:05:01,663
Well, I need a first name.

85
00:05:04,205 --> 00:05:07,914
I remember his
receptionist's name. Julie.

86
00:05:08,262 --> 00:05:10,822
Cute redhead with a slight
speech impediment.

87
00:05:11,106 --> 00:05:12,937
She called me "Charlie."

88
00:05:15,666 --> 00:05:17,258
I almost asked her out once...

89
00:05:17,506 --> 00:05:19,781
but I couldn't face
the inevitable phone calls.

90
00:05:20,058 --> 00:05:23,846
"I love you, Charlie.
Don't leave me."

91
00:05:24,575 --> 00:05:28,250
Yeah, yeah,
and your doctor's first name is?

92
00:05:29,887 --> 00:05:31,240
Oh, I have no idea.

93
00:05:32,523 --> 00:05:34,241
Idiot.

94
00:05:35,785 --> 00:05:38,094
Yes, Beverly Hills, California.

95
00:05:38,379 --> 00:05:40,415
Dr. Schwartz.

96
00:05:40,679 --> 00:05:42,829
Yeah, I don't know the first name.

97
00:05:43,189 --> 00:05:45,464
No, I'm not kidding.

98
00:05:47,037 --> 00:05:50,029
There are 128 Dr. Schwartzes
in Beverly Hills.

99
00:05:50,342 --> 00:05:51,821
What street is he on?

100
00:05:52,057 --> 00:05:53,809
Wilshire Boulevard, I think.

101
00:05:54,065 --> 00:05:56,738
Wilshire Boulevard, we think.

102
00:05:57,620 --> 00:06:00,054
Okay, we're down to 47 Schwartzes.

103
00:06:00,799 --> 00:06:04,394
Just forget it. Drive down Wilshire.
I'll know the building when I see it.

104
00:06:04,731 --> 00:06:06,210
Never mind, we're gonna play...

105
00:06:06,446 --> 00:06:08,437
Find the Jewish
Doctor in Beverly Hills.

106
00:06:09,332 --> 00:06:10,651
Wait, wait. There it is.

107
00:06:16,234 --> 00:06:18,225
Now, you see,
that wouldn't have happened...

108
00:06:18,493 --> 00:06:20,643
if you'd been wearing your seat belt.

109
00:06:21,211 --> 00:06:23,441
Alan, if I can ever use my legs again...

110
00:06:23,721 --> 00:06:27,953
the first thing I'm gonna do
is kick your ass into your throat.

111
00:06:36,228 --> 00:06:38,378
That's not Julie.

112
00:06:40,118 --> 00:06:43,906
- So?
- It's just important to me that you know.

113
00:06:44,761 --> 00:06:47,400
- Can I help you?
- Yeah, I'm Charlie Harper.

114
00:06:47,689 --> 00:06:50,203
- I need to see my doctor.
- Do you have an appointment?

115
00:06:50,492 --> 00:06:51,845
No, but this is an emergency.

116
00:06:52,081 --> 00:06:54,641
He has to get back to Notre Dame
and ring the bell.

117
00:06:56,348 --> 00:07:00,057
Oh, I get it. He's hunched over.
That's funny.

118
00:07:01,953 --> 00:07:03,989
Yeah, can I see my doctor, please?

119
00:07:04,253 --> 00:07:05,891
- Who's your doctor?
- Dr. Schwartz.

120
00:07:06,136 --> 00:07:07,933
- Stanley Schwartz?
- Yes, Stanley.

121
00:07:08,185 --> 00:07:10,494
- It's Stanley.
- Thank you.

122
00:07:10,779 --> 00:07:12,690
When was the last time
you were here?

123
00:07:12,996 --> 00:07:15,556
I don't know.
A couple of years ago. Why?

124
00:07:16,091 --> 00:07:20,448
- Dr. Schwartz passed away.
- Oh, no.

125
00:07:20,901 --> 00:07:22,300
So where's Julie?

126
00:07:23,244 --> 00:07:24,723
Julie we had to let go.

127
00:07:24,959 --> 00:07:29,191
She was playing a little fast and loose
with the old prescription pad.

128
00:07:31,024 --> 00:07:33,777
I'm guessing Valium.

129
00:07:35,458 --> 00:07:37,289
Is there somebody else
who can see him?

130
00:07:37,549 --> 00:07:39,665
Yeah, but not Dr. Schwartz's doctor,
okay?

131
00:07:39,933 --> 00:07:42,163
Dr. Talmadge took over
Dr. Schwartz's practice.

132
00:07:42,443 --> 00:07:45,082
It's a little tight right now,
but I could squeeze you in.

133
00:07:45,831 --> 00:07:47,901
That's kind of how this happened.

134
00:07:48,676 --> 00:07:51,827
Oh, my. So this was a sexual injury.

135
00:07:55,159 --> 00:07:57,195
Well, thank goodness you're okay.

136
00:08:08,293 --> 00:08:10,966
This is really gross.
Why do I have to do it?

137
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:13,174
- You want your toilet seat back?
- Yes.

138
00:08:13,438 --> 00:08:15,474
Then keep scrubbing.

139
00:08:16,617 --> 00:08:20,132
You know, taking it wasn't funny.
I could have broke my butt.

140
00:08:20,466 --> 00:08:22,502
Oh, come on.
How could that not be funny?

141
00:08:25,109 --> 00:08:28,545
Don't forget to clean on the outside.
That's all you.

142
00:08:29,124 --> 00:08:32,400
- And the floor, and the wall.
- Okay, okay.

143
00:08:32,721 --> 00:08:34,871
How in the hell
did you hit the wall anyway?

144
00:08:35,148 --> 00:08:38,345
I don't know,
it just gets away from me sometimes.

145
00:08:39,958 --> 00:08:41,471
After a day scrubbing toilets...

146
00:08:41,715 --> 00:08:45,628
I'm betting you'll be able to pee
through a Cheerio at 10 paces.

147
00:08:46,943 --> 00:08:48,774
Oh, God.

148
00:08:49,035 --> 00:08:51,151
Oh, jeez.

149
00:08:51,419 --> 00:08:52,693
Hey, guess what.

150
00:08:52,925 --> 00:08:55,883
The Soviet Union
is boycotting the Olympics.

151
00:09:02,043 --> 00:09:04,273
My pain is just a big joke
to you, isn't it?

152
00:09:04,553 --> 00:09:07,272
I offered to help you, Charlie,
and you refused, so...

153
00:09:07,565 --> 00:09:08,600
yeah.

154
00:09:10,242 --> 00:09:13,279
I'll tell you, if you came to me
as a patient in this much pain...

155
00:09:13,588 --> 00:09:15,977
I wouldn't make you wait.
I'd see you right away.

156
00:09:16,265 --> 00:09:19,575
So would my dry cleaner,
but I don't let him touch me either.

157
00:09:19,904 --> 00:09:21,337
I could help you, Charlie.

158
00:09:21,578 --> 00:09:23,967
I've already isolated
the source of your discomfort.

159
00:09:24,255 --> 00:09:26,644
All that's left would be
to realign your vertebrae...

160
00:09:26,932 --> 00:09:29,048
through a gentle series
of manipulations and stretches...

161
00:09:29,316 --> 00:09:30,829
thereby alleviating your pain.

162
00:09:33,708 --> 00:09:36,268
Well, you didn't explain it like that.
That's different.

163
00:09:36,552 --> 00:09:39,191
- So you'll let me work on you?
- Not in a million years.

164
00:09:40,944 --> 00:09:44,175
Fine. Worship at the altar
of the American Medical Association.

165
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:47,014
Swallow the pharmaceutical companies'
propaganda.

166
00:09:47,302 --> 00:09:50,738
I'll swallow it, I'll sniff it,
I'll insert it rectally.

167
00:09:52,698 --> 00:09:55,212
Anything to kill the pain.
I'm dying here.

168
00:09:56,128 --> 00:09:57,925
Mr. Harper, I'm Dr. Talmadge.

169
00:09:58,178 --> 00:10:00,567
Hello, doctor.

170
00:10:03,072 --> 00:10:05,347
Hallelujah. It's a miracle.

171
00:10:09,806 --> 00:10:11,558
So I see you're having some back pain.

172
00:10:12,107 --> 00:10:14,621
That will be $ 100, please.

173
00:10:16,583 --> 00:10:18,414
Yeah, it started in my back...

174
00:10:18,674 --> 00:10:22,747
but now it's kind of radiating out
into a body-wide unbearable agony.

175
00:10:23,108 --> 00:10:25,906
You have a really cute little nose,
you know that?

176
00:10:26,831 --> 00:10:29,550
- Did the pain start in your lower back?
- Best I can tell...

177
00:10:29,842 --> 00:10:31,560
it's a spasm between
L4 and L5.

178
00:10:31,808 --> 00:10:34,003
- Oh, are you a doctor?
- Yes, I'm a chiropractor.

179
00:10:34,276 --> 00:10:36,153
So no.

180
00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:40,029
How did this happen?

181
00:10:40,258 --> 00:10:42,647
Well, I slipped.

182
00:10:42,977 --> 00:10:44,968
On an actress.

183
00:10:46,030 --> 00:10:47,907
I can handle this, Alan.

184
00:10:48,163 --> 00:10:50,393
Okay, see, the thing is,
I was in the middle of...

185
00:10:50,673 --> 00:10:52,231
An actress.

186
00:10:53,099 --> 00:10:54,498
I'm warning you.

187
00:10:54,730 --> 00:10:57,847
- Do the details really matter?
- No, no, I think I got the picture.

188
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:00,469
There's video if you need it.

189
00:11:01,423 --> 00:11:02,697
Keep it up.

190
00:11:03,305 --> 00:11:05,694
Okay, I see here your last visit
was four years ago.

191
00:11:05,982 --> 00:11:07,893
A mild hernia brought about by...

192
00:11:08,158 --> 00:11:10,069
Okay. I think I'm seeing
a pattern here.

193
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:14,218
He's a sexual compulsive
with narcissistic tendencies.

194
00:11:14,515 --> 00:11:16,710
Oh, so you're
a pretend psychiatrist too.

195
00:11:20,623 --> 00:11:22,534
So, what's the course
of treatment here?

196
00:11:22,798 --> 00:11:25,392
A pill, a shot?
Maybe one of those epidurals?

197
00:11:25,684 --> 00:11:28,403
First I'm going to get
your blood pressure and take x-rays.

198
00:11:28,695 --> 00:11:32,370
- I take blood pressure and x-rays.
- Your mother must be very proud.

199
00:11:33,171 --> 00:11:35,082
Actually, no.

200
00:11:35,681 --> 00:11:37,478
Someone will be in
to take you to x-ray.

201
00:11:37,731 --> 00:11:39,562
Wait. I'm still in pain.

202
00:11:39,989 --> 00:11:41,866
Try and hang in there.
In the meantime...

203
00:11:42,123 --> 00:11:44,398
maybe your little buddy
can give you a massage.

204
00:11:47,602 --> 00:11:51,311
- Can you believe her?
- Yeah, she is something else.

205
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:54,379
Please don't tell me you're interested
in that condescending...

206
00:11:54,671 --> 00:11:56,184
arrogant excuse for a woman.

207
00:11:56,428 --> 00:11:58,737
Pardon me, Alan,
but that is a condescending...

208
00:11:59,021 --> 00:12:01,581
arrogant, hot excuse for a woman.

209
00:12:01,866 --> 00:12:05,017
She's just your typical obnoxious MD.

210
00:12:05,338 --> 00:12:07,329
I'm a doctor.
I have special license plates.

211
00:12:07,596 --> 00:12:10,030
I can park wherever I want.

212
00:12:11,235 --> 00:12:13,544
I know where I wanna park.

213
00:12:14,247 --> 00:12:16,807
You're unbelievable.
Does your penis have an off switch?

214
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:19,369
A pause button?

215
00:12:19,601 --> 00:12:22,035
No, just a little freckle.

216
00:12:23,282 --> 00:12:25,876
You're always telling me I should date
a better class of woman.

217
00:12:26,168 --> 00:12:27,567
What's classier than a doctor?

218
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:31,349
Oh, please. Four years of med school,
two years of internship...

219
00:12:31,690 --> 00:12:35,444
a year of residency,
and everybody thinks they're so special.

220
00:12:35,789 --> 00:12:38,064
But I'll tell you something.
A new day is dawning.

221
00:12:38,341 --> 00:12:41,856
A day of reckoning.
And it is spelled HMO.

222
00:12:44,197 --> 00:12:47,189
No more country clubs.
No more Cadillacs.

223
00:12:47,501 --> 00:12:51,938
Just sky-high insurance premiums
and low, slow, copay reimbursements.

224
00:12:52,311 --> 00:12:55,269
Just like the rest of us.

225
00:12:55,992 --> 00:12:58,745
I'll bet she knows a lot
of secret anatomy stuff.

226
00:13:00,217 --> 00:13:03,732
You know, places you touch
and the top of your head flies off.

227
00:13:05,613 --> 00:13:08,525
If you have sex with a doctor,
there's a chance they'll split...

228
00:13:08,834 --> 00:13:11,029
in the middle of the night
for an emergency.

229
00:13:11,302 --> 00:13:13,338
Well, that's just a price
you'll have to pay.

230
00:13:13,602 --> 00:13:16,116
No, no. That works for me.

231
00:13:18,622 --> 00:13:20,977
Okay, I finished the toilet,
the shower...

232
00:13:21,257 --> 00:13:24,215
and the sink.
- What took you so long?

233
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:27,512
I went to the bathroom,
and I had to start over.

234
00:13:28,953 --> 00:13:31,183
Take these, and get started
on the kitchen floor.

235
00:13:31,463 --> 00:13:33,419
Why? I didn't pee in here.

236
00:13:35,604 --> 00:13:37,196
Okay, once, but it was in the sink.

237
00:13:38,867 --> 00:13:40,937
The sink? How'd you manage that?

238
00:13:41,209 --> 00:13:44,565
It's not that hard. You just gotta
drink a lot of root beer, lean back...

239
00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:46,608
and figure the angle.

240
00:13:51,290 --> 00:13:53,246
So tell me about Dr. Talmadge.

241
00:13:53,507 --> 00:13:56,340
- Is she seeing anybody?
- Yes.

242
00:13:56,644 --> 00:13:59,761
- Is it serious?
- Dog bite.

243
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:02,730
- No, I mean...
- Charlie, give it a rest.

244
00:14:03,002 --> 00:14:04,355
What?

245
00:14:04,592 --> 00:14:07,709
You're sitting here in pain
because of a casual sexual encounter...

246
00:14:08,022 --> 00:14:10,217
and now you're trying
to drum up another one.

247
00:14:11,452 --> 00:14:14,649
- Yeah, so?
- Don't you get it?

248
00:14:14,965 --> 00:14:16,683
Your entire life is about jumping...

249
00:14:16,931 --> 00:14:19,729
from one shallow,
meaningless relationship to the next.

250
00:14:20,696 --> 00:14:22,129
And?

251
00:14:22,829 --> 00:14:25,184
You're a grown man.
You can't go through life...

252
00:14:25,464 --> 00:14:28,820
drinking and partying and humping
anything that doesn't shake you off.

253
00:14:29,522 --> 00:14:31,672
Yes, I can.

254
00:14:31,948 --> 00:14:34,098
But sooner or later,
it's gonna catch up to you.

255
00:14:34,374 --> 00:14:36,330
Eventually,
you will have to pay the piper.

256
00:14:36,591 --> 00:14:38,547
- Who says?
- Everybody says.

257
00:14:38,808 --> 00:14:40,844
Really? Because I'm just hearing you.

258
00:14:41,485 --> 00:14:44,636
If 2000 years of human history
has taught us anything...

259
00:14:44,957 --> 00:14:47,346
it's that there is karmic justice
in the world...

260
00:14:47,634 --> 00:14:49,909
and that when people live
the way you do...

261
00:14:50,185 --> 00:14:52,460
bad things happen to them
to even things out.

262
00:14:52,737 --> 00:14:54,614
Well, I don't agree.

263
00:14:55,372 --> 00:14:56,930
It's not up for debate.

264
00:14:57,171 --> 00:14:59,765
It's a law, like gravity.

265
00:15:00,057 --> 00:15:01,968
Oh, I agree with gravity.

266
00:15:02,232 --> 00:15:04,541
Good, we wouldn't want you
flying off the planet...

267
00:15:04,825 --> 00:15:06,577
with nothing to hump
but satellites.

268
00:15:06,833 --> 00:15:09,267
If it makes you feel better,
something bad happened.

269
00:15:09,552 --> 00:15:11,747
- I'm in excruciating pain.
- That's not enough.

270
00:15:12,605 --> 00:15:14,800
Trust me, Charlie.
The piper has yet to be paid.

271
00:15:15,073 --> 00:15:18,429
The only question is how high a tab
you want before the bill comes due.

272
00:15:20,344 --> 00:15:22,460
Okay. I get it.

273
00:15:23,063 --> 00:15:24,815
Well, good.

274
00:15:25,321 --> 00:15:28,438
So you think I have a shot
with that doctor, or what?

275
00:15:31,136 --> 00:15:34,333
It's like trying to talk Shakespeare
to a Hershey bar.

276
00:15:39,209 --> 00:15:41,086
Who's Piper?

277
00:15:44,981 --> 00:15:49,497
Oh, you poor, clueless bitch.
Never trust a drifter with an eye patch.

278
00:15:50,879 --> 00:15:52,631
- Berta.
- What?

279
00:15:52,887 --> 00:15:55,003
I'm tired,
and my hands are all red and pruney.

280
00:15:55,271 --> 00:15:57,148
I've seen your grades. Get used to it.

281
00:15:59,537 --> 00:16:00,811
How do I know when I'm done?

282
00:16:01,043 --> 00:16:03,079
Don't worry about that, honey,
I'll tell you.

283
00:16:03,344 --> 00:16:07,053
Oh, for God's sakes, don't kiss him.
He's your brother.

284
00:16:08,865 --> 00:16:11,015
- I have x-rays.
- Oh, good. Let me see them.

285
00:16:11,291 --> 00:16:13,043
Oh, golly, no. Only for a doctor.

286
00:16:13,843 --> 00:16:15,959
Hey, I'm a doctor.

287
00:16:16,227 --> 00:16:18,183
Oh, yeah? Where you parked?

288
00:16:22,543 --> 00:16:24,261
Alan, you gotta relax.

289
00:16:24,509 --> 00:16:27,865
You're harboring the kind of resentment
that eats away at your insides...

290
00:16:28,190 --> 00:16:31,546
until you wake up one day
peeing blood and crapping into a bag.

291
00:16:31,871 --> 00:16:33,350
Thanks for the advice.

292
00:16:33,586 --> 00:16:35,622
You know the difference
between you and me?

293
00:16:35,887 --> 00:16:37,206
I have a functioning liver...

294
00:16:37,434 --> 00:16:39,504
and somehow,
you're gonna get laid tonight.

295
00:16:40,404 --> 00:16:43,760
That's ridiculous, Alan.
She's an educated professional.

296
00:16:44,085 --> 00:16:46,838
Probably gonna have to throw
a few fancy meals at her first.

297
00:16:47,139 --> 00:16:49,255
Boo-hoo, you'll have to wait
a couple of weeks.

298
00:16:49,523 --> 00:16:51,115
Couple of weeks?

299
00:16:53,078 --> 00:16:55,069
Anyway, the difference
between you and me...

300
00:16:55,337 --> 00:16:58,010
is that when life gives me lemons,
I make lemonade.

301
00:16:58,307 --> 00:17:00,775
When you get lemons,
you just bite into them...

302
00:17:01,068 --> 00:17:03,184
and suck them inside out.

303
00:17:04,749 --> 00:17:08,025
Okay. Let's see what we've got.

304
00:17:10,479 --> 00:17:12,231
No fractures, no dislocations.

305
00:17:12,487 --> 00:17:16,162
- Looks like just a simple muscle spasm.
- Between L4 and L5?

306
00:17:16,502 --> 00:17:18,891
Oh, good for you.

307
00:17:19,472 --> 00:17:22,350
Okay, I am gonna give you a shot,
which should ease the pain...

308
00:17:22,651 --> 00:17:24,926
and also allow
your muscles to relax.

309
00:17:25,203 --> 00:17:26,761
Have you had Demerol before?

310
00:17:27,002 --> 00:17:28,515
No, but I've heard nice
things about it.

311
00:17:29,386 --> 00:17:31,775
Okay, I'm just gonna pull
your shorts down a little.

312
00:17:32,063 --> 00:17:34,736
But Dr. Talmadge,
I don't even know your first name.

313
00:17:35,033 --> 00:17:37,388
- Michelle.
- Michelle.

314
00:17:37,668 --> 00:17:39,021
That's prettier than Stanley.

315
00:17:42,897 --> 00:17:44,694
- Sorry.
- That's okay.

316
00:17:44,946 --> 00:17:48,905
It's all part of the little meet-cute
thing we got going here.

317
00:17:51,304 --> 00:17:53,977
So how long does it take
before I start feeling...

318
00:17:58,331 --> 00:18:00,128
happy.

319
00:18:02,431 --> 00:18:06,504
Happy, happy, happy.
Happy.

320
00:18:06,864 --> 00:18:09,173
Michelle, did you know
I have a house on the beach?

321
00:18:09,876 --> 00:18:13,232
- Really? I love the beach.
- Oh, good, because I have a house there.

322
00:18:15,147 --> 00:18:18,378
Wait outside, I need to give your brother
a hernia exam to make sure...

323
00:18:18,702 --> 00:18:21,375
he hasn't reinjured the area.
- A hernia exam.

324
00:18:23,596 --> 00:18:26,474
- And your boxers.
- Bye-bye, boxers.

325
00:18:31,585 --> 00:18:33,496
I was wrong. There's no justice.

326
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:35,910
I thought there was justice,
but there's not.

327
00:18:36,186 --> 00:18:37,744
What, you think there's justice?

328
00:18:37,985 --> 00:18:40,021
Because there's not.

329
00:18:40,704 --> 00:18:41,978
Turn your head and cough.

330
00:18:45,096 --> 00:18:47,530
- You have very warm hands.
- Again.

331
00:18:47,815 --> 00:18:50,124
You have very warm hands.

332
00:18:54,298 --> 00:18:56,732
So any chance I could
take you out for dinner tonight?

333
00:18:57,017 --> 00:19:00,054
- You're hitting on me?
- You started it.

334
00:19:00,364 --> 00:19:03,083
- You're amazing.
- Well, statistically...

335
00:19:03,375 --> 00:19:06,208
I'm only slightly above average.

336
00:19:06,763 --> 00:19:09,960
But I make up for it
with enthusiasm and perseverance.

337
00:19:10,277 --> 00:19:12,745
No, what's amazing
is that you don't remember me.

338
00:19:13,038 --> 00:19:14,596
Well, sure I remember you.

339
00:19:14,836 --> 00:19:17,908
You're the pretty woman cupping
my testicles from earlier.

340
00:19:18,224 --> 00:19:21,739
Back when I was in medical school,
you and I went out for a couple months.

341
00:19:25,377 --> 00:19:27,208
You wanna loosen your grip there?

342
00:19:27,845 --> 00:19:29,597
Then for reasons I never understood...

343
00:19:29,853 --> 00:19:32,492
you stopped calling me,
and started seeing my roommate.

344
00:19:34,036 --> 00:19:35,992
The grip.

345
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:39,410
I always hoped I'd run into you again.

346
00:19:39,892 --> 00:19:43,567
Please. Just leave me one.

347
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:47,174
Oh, dear God.

348
00:19:47,965 --> 00:19:50,433
My brother's making lemonade.

349
00:19:56,414 --> 00:19:58,006
I need to go to the bathroom.

350
00:19:58,255 --> 00:19:59,973
So go.

351
00:20:03,274 --> 00:20:04,912
Oh, yeah.

352
00:20:14,317 --> 00:20:15,830
Good night.
I'll see you tomorrow.

353
00:20:16,074 --> 00:20:17,632
- Night.
- Night.

354
00:20:17,872 --> 00:20:20,784
So, are you gonna tell me
what happened with you and the doctor?

355
00:20:21,093 --> 00:20:22,367
What do you think happened?

356
00:20:23,770 --> 00:20:25,647
I think she shot you full of drugs...

357
00:20:25,904 --> 00:20:27,940
you dropped trou,
she jumped your bones...

358
00:20:28,204 --> 00:20:30,593
and you're the luckiest bastard
to walk the earth.

359
00:20:31,425 --> 00:20:34,098
Well, for your information...

360
00:20:34,395 --> 00:20:36,750
that's exactly what happened.

361
00:20:38,787 --> 00:20:40,982
Not even a little justice.

362
00:20:41,255 --> 00:20:44,850
This is a justice-free zone.

363
00:20:45,814 --> 00:20:48,772
Looking for justice?
Sorry, fresh out.

364
00:20:50,332 --> 00:20:52,766
Enjoy sucking on that lemon.

365
00:20:54,891 --> 00:20:57,359
Nope, not yet.
