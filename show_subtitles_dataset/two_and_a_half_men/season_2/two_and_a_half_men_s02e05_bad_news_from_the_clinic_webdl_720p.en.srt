1
00:00:01,710 --> 00:00:04,349
- Have any homework this weekend?
- A little.

2
00:00:04,637 --> 00:00:06,707
Why don't you
get started on it tonight.

3
00:00:06,979 --> 00:00:08,048
But it's only Friday.

4
00:00:08,276 --> 00:00:10,551
I know, but if you do it tonight,
you won't worry.

5
00:00:10,869 --> 00:00:12,143
I'm not worried.

6
00:00:15,595 --> 00:00:17,426
Hey. What are you guys up to tonight?

7
00:00:17,686 --> 00:00:20,075
- Jake's gonna do his homework.
- Why?

8
00:00:21,742 --> 00:00:24,210
It's only Friday.

9
00:00:25,883 --> 00:00:27,680
Let me tell you something
about Charlie.

10
00:00:27,932 --> 00:00:30,890
He was a lousy student. He always
put off doing his homework...

11
00:00:31,194 --> 00:00:34,948
and his grades reflected it.
- Seems like he's doing okay now.

12
00:00:38,931 --> 00:00:41,604
- Go get your books.
- I left my books at Mom's.

13
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:45,859
- Fine. I'll have her bring them over.
- Okay. They're in my bag.

14
00:00:47,463 --> 00:00:49,135
Go get them.

15
00:00:50,557 --> 00:00:52,468
Okay. Well, don't wait up.

16
00:00:53,443 --> 00:00:56,162
- Pretty confident, huh?
- Yeah.

17
00:00:56,454 --> 00:00:58,888
Thus, the "don't wait up."

18
00:00:59,173 --> 00:01:01,323
Didn't you meet this girl
a couple of days ago?

19
00:01:01,598 --> 00:01:04,908
Yup. So tonight's the night.
You know, the three-day rule.

20
00:01:05,237 --> 00:01:06,716
That's the three-date rule.

21
00:01:08,499 --> 00:01:10,057
Three dates? That's crazy talk.

22
00:01:11,426 --> 00:01:14,145
All right. If you bring her
back here, please be discreet.

23
00:01:14,437 --> 00:01:16,587
Don't worry.
First night's always at her place.

24
00:01:16,863 --> 00:01:20,333
- Is that another rule?
- No. It's just a common courtesy.

25
00:01:21,965 --> 00:01:24,877
A woman's more relaxed and
comfortable in her own surroundings.

26
00:01:26,231 --> 00:01:29,428
Plus, the minute she falls asleep,
I can hit the bricks.

27
00:01:29,744 --> 00:01:32,304
That's lovely. It's a shame
you don't work for Hallmark.

28
00:01:32,588 --> 00:01:35,739
Yeah, I'll bet those guys
get laid like crazy.

29
00:01:36,770 --> 00:01:38,761
- Goodnight, buddy.
- Night.

30
00:01:39,279 --> 00:01:40,917
What happened
to my chicken nuggets?

31
00:01:41,161 --> 00:01:42,992
What are you talking about?
You ate them.

32
00:01:43,252 --> 00:01:45,368
Now, stop procrastinating
and do your homework.

33
00:01:46,765 --> 00:01:48,278
What does procrastinating mean?

34
00:01:48,522 --> 00:01:51,161
It means putting off stuff
that you have to do.

35
00:01:52,997 --> 00:01:55,670
- Can you use it in a sentence?
- I just did.

36
00:01:56,384 --> 00:01:57,737
Oh, yeah.

37
00:01:59,270 --> 00:02:01,625
Did I tell you a bug
flew in my ear today?

38
00:02:06,128 --> 00:02:07,880
Charlie?

39
00:02:08,763 --> 00:02:12,551
- You asleep?
- What? No.

40
00:02:12,904 --> 00:02:15,498
No. You?

41
00:02:15,789 --> 00:02:18,428
Listen, I have to
get up early tomorrow, so...

42
00:02:18,968 --> 00:02:20,686
- You want me to leave?
- Do you mind?

43
00:02:20,933 --> 00:02:23,367
No, I'm cool either way:
Stay or go.

44
00:02:23,652 --> 00:02:25,290
Okay.

45
00:02:25,868 --> 00:02:27,460
So I'm going?

46
00:02:29,381 --> 00:02:30,655
Thanks, you're a doll.

47
00:02:34,567 --> 00:02:39,595
You know, I actually prefer
waking up in my own bed.

48
00:02:40,547 --> 00:02:42,299
Personal little quirk.

49
00:02:42,973 --> 00:02:45,362
- You don't mind, right?
- Not at all.

50
00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:47,561
Good.

51
00:02:47,824 --> 00:02:51,533
So this worked out well
for all concerned, huh?

52
00:02:51,881 --> 00:02:53,997
It was fantastic.
We'll have to do it again.

53
00:02:54,767 --> 00:02:56,359
Absolutely.

54
00:02:57,736 --> 00:03:01,331
- But not tonight?
- No.

55
00:03:02,964 --> 00:03:06,923
- Okay. Well, I'll call you.
- It's probably easier if I call you.

56
00:03:08,902 --> 00:03:10,176
Sure. Either way.

57
00:03:10,408 --> 00:03:12,444
- I call you, you call me.
- I'll call you.

58
00:03:14,381 --> 00:03:16,258
Good.

59
00:03:16,514 --> 00:03:19,267
- So I guess I'll just let myself out.
- Okay.

60
00:03:33,702 --> 00:03:35,658
Sherri, you asleep?

61
00:03:37,215 --> 00:03:38,409
Finally.

62
00:04:09,543 --> 00:04:11,852
- How was school this week?
- Okay.

63
00:04:12,136 --> 00:04:15,287
- Any homework for the weekend?
- Nope.

64
00:04:16,235 --> 00:04:18,908
- Really?
- Okay, yes.

65
00:04:20,835 --> 00:04:22,871
Do we have to go through this
every Friday?

66
00:04:23,135 --> 00:04:25,205
I'd rather we didn't.

67
00:04:29,952 --> 00:04:31,351
Curly fries.

68
00:04:31,583 --> 00:04:33,972
When I was your age,
we didn't even have curly fries.

69
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:37,093
We had to make do
with straight or crinkle cut.

70
00:04:37,396 --> 00:04:39,546
- What?
- I'm just trying to distract you...

71
00:04:39,822 --> 00:04:42,097
while I steal your fries.
- Hey.

72
00:04:42,373 --> 00:04:44,329
Jake, don't be selfish.
Let him have one.

73
00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:46,308
So no date tonight?

74
00:04:46,555 --> 00:04:48,307
I thought
I'd just hang with you guys.

75
00:04:48,563 --> 00:04:52,033
- What about that girl you're seeing?
- Sherri? I'm playing that slow.

76
00:04:54,543 --> 00:04:57,057
Really? Do you mean
at a leisurely pace...

77
00:04:57,345 --> 00:04:59,939
or as if you were
developmentally challenged?

78
00:05:01,527 --> 00:05:03,995
Oh, aren't you clever? Bite me.

79
00:05:05,793 --> 00:05:07,909
Alan, most beautiful women
are used to guys...

80
00:05:08,177 --> 00:05:10,054
chasing after them. They expect it.

81
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:13,222
Squeeze a little more ketchup on it,
would you, buddy?

82
00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:15,919
However, if you hang back
and stay cool...

83
00:05:16,206 --> 00:05:18,276
the women come to you.

84
00:05:18,841 --> 00:05:22,038
Well, not to you specifically,
but you get the theory.

85
00:05:22,354 --> 00:05:24,629
Yeah, I'm not stupid.
Just physically repellent...

86
00:05:24,905 --> 00:05:26,861
and inherently unlovable.

87
00:05:27,122 --> 00:05:29,955
Don't get snippy with me.
I'm trying to teach you something.

88
00:05:30,258 --> 00:05:32,772
Hey, I agreed to one.

89
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:35,972
If you're finished with dinner,
get started on homework.

90
00:05:36,281 --> 00:05:38,397
I'm still hungry. He ate all my fries.

91
00:05:38,665 --> 00:05:41,259
You can have ice cream
when you've done your homework.

92
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:43,666
Isn't that procrastinating?

93
00:05:48,283 --> 00:05:50,274
Go.

94
00:05:53,678 --> 00:05:57,193
Man, that kid guards his plate
like a one-armed inmate, doesn't he?

95
00:06:00,579 --> 00:06:03,412
Hello? Oh, hey, Sherri.

96
00:06:03,716 --> 00:06:05,274
How's it going?

97
00:06:05,514 --> 00:06:08,472
Tonight? No, I'm sorry, I can't.
I've already got plans.

98
00:06:10,574 --> 00:06:14,249
How about tomorrow night?
Oh, you've got plans.

99
00:06:14,589 --> 00:06:16,705
Okay. Well, Sunday?

100
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,670
Monday?

101
00:06:19,942 --> 00:06:23,014
What about Tuesday?
You know what?

102
00:06:23,330 --> 00:06:27,209
I'm looking at the wrong month
in my date book. Tonight works.

103
00:06:29,352 --> 00:06:31,468
How about I pick you up at 8?

104
00:06:31,945 --> 00:06:35,176
Okay, I'll meet you at 7.

105
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:37,058
How about Antonio's?

106
00:06:37,298 --> 00:06:38,890
The Oak Room it is.

107
00:06:39,138 --> 00:06:41,208
See you soon.

108
00:06:43,529 --> 00:06:46,999
- What just happened?
- You were playing it slow.

109
00:06:51,643 --> 00:06:53,918
- Everything okay?
- No, perfect, Stephan. Thanks.

110
00:06:54,194 --> 00:06:56,264
Always good to see you.

111
00:06:57,163 --> 00:06:59,199
I liked it too.

112
00:07:00,843 --> 00:07:02,834
So you must be a regular here.

113
00:07:03,102 --> 00:07:05,252
Yeah. Food's good
and I bring a lot of clients.

114
00:07:05,527 --> 00:07:07,643
Speaking of which,
it's getting kind of late.

115
00:07:07,911 --> 00:07:10,505
- I've got an early meeting tomorrow.
- I'll get the check.

116
00:07:10,797 --> 00:07:12,116
I already took care of it.

117
00:07:12,344 --> 00:07:14,380
- When?
- You were in the little boys' room.

118
00:07:14,645 --> 00:07:17,842
- That's not right.
- It's fine. I asked you out. No big deal.

119
00:07:18,158 --> 00:07:20,672
No, you shouldn't call it
"the little boys' room."

120
00:07:22,465 --> 00:07:25,184
- Sorry.
- You're forgiven.

121
00:07:25,476 --> 00:07:26,465
So we can just go.

122
00:07:27,065 --> 00:07:29,135
If it's okay,
I wanna go back to my place.

123
00:07:29,407 --> 00:07:31,796
Oh, great. I'll follow you.

124
00:07:32,084 --> 00:07:34,279
I don't think so, Charlie.
I'm kind of tired.

125
00:07:35,221 --> 00:07:36,779
Okay. Well, how about this?

126
00:07:37,019 --> 00:07:40,329
I'll drive you home, carry you upstairs,
tuck you into bed...

127
00:07:40,657 --> 00:07:43,808
kiss you good night, and just
as you're drifting off to sleep...

128
00:07:44,129 --> 00:07:47,724
I will lick your body
from head to toe.

129
00:07:49,482 --> 00:07:52,713
Lovely as that sounds,
I'm gonna have to take a rain check.

130
00:07:53,831 --> 00:07:56,391
Okay. Yeah, I guess
it is getting kind of late.

131
00:07:56,675 --> 00:07:59,587
- It's almost 9.
- Thanks for understanding.

132
00:07:59,895 --> 00:08:04,013
- Sure. Hey, we're okay, right?
- Yeah.

133
00:08:04,370 --> 00:08:06,600
- Did I say something to upset you?
- No.

134
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:08,198
- Are you mad at me?
- No.

135
00:08:08,427 --> 00:08:10,304
- Promise?
- Yes.

136
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:13,757
Do I sound like a big old girl?

137
00:08:19,802 --> 00:08:21,394
Why didn't you do this part?

138
00:08:21,642 --> 00:08:23,758
That's extra credit.
You don't have to do it.

139
00:08:24,026 --> 00:08:27,223
- Why don't you do it anyway?
- Because I don't have to.

140
00:08:27,539 --> 00:08:29,973
It shows that you're willing
to make an extra effort.

141
00:08:30,258 --> 00:08:32,613
But I'm not.

142
00:08:34,732 --> 00:08:37,007
- Do it anyway.
- Why?

143
00:08:37,284 --> 00:08:39,195
If you spent as much time
doing the work...

144
00:08:39,458 --> 00:08:41,449
as you do arguing about it,
we'd be done.

145
00:08:41,717 --> 00:08:44,470
I am done. This is extra.

146
00:08:46,986 --> 00:08:48,544
- Hey.
- Hey.

147
00:08:48,784 --> 00:08:50,854
You're home early.

148
00:08:52,214 --> 00:08:54,205
Alan, if you got something to say...

149
00:08:54,472 --> 00:08:56,542
why don't you just
come out and say it?

150
00:09:00,118 --> 00:09:01,756
You're home early?

151
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,514
Yeah, that's smart. Keep pushing me.

152
00:09:08,608 --> 00:09:13,238
- Did you see that?
- Yeah, he took my ice cream.

153
00:09:23,371 --> 00:09:25,362
Hey, neighbor.

154
00:09:26,549 --> 00:09:27,948
Hi, Rose.

155
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:31,968
- Didn't you have dessert with Sherri?
- How did you know I was with Sherri?

156
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:35,153
Oh, Charlie, you still don't get me,
do you?

157
00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:40,299
- So do you wanna talk about it?
- No.

158
00:09:42,985 --> 00:09:45,419
She probably just had
to get up early, like she said.

159
00:09:45,703 --> 00:09:47,022
Probably.

160
00:09:47,251 --> 00:09:49,446
Unless her real date
didn't start until later...

161
00:09:49,718 --> 00:09:51,913
and she just didn't wanna eat alone.

162
00:09:52,186 --> 00:09:54,495
What?

163
00:09:54,778 --> 00:09:56,894
Oh, come on, Charlie.
Double-booking.

164
00:09:57,162 --> 00:09:58,481
You practically invented it.

165
00:09:59,713 --> 00:10:02,944
No, she wouldn't do that to me.
Why would she do that to me?

166
00:10:03,268 --> 00:10:06,419
Did she do that to me?
She did that to me, didn't she?

167
00:10:09,541 --> 00:10:11,020
- Excuse me?
- Sorry.

168
00:10:11,256 --> 00:10:13,850
I was just taking
a little selfish delight in your pain.

169
00:10:14,142 --> 00:10:15,939
The Germans call it "schadenfreude"...

170
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:18,625
but here in the U.S.A.,
we just go:

171
00:10:22,422 --> 00:10:24,777
- Thanks.
- Oh, Charlie...

172
00:10:25,057 --> 00:10:28,652
you don't need a girl like that.
You could do so much better.

173
00:10:29,783 --> 00:10:31,580
You're right. I can.

174
00:10:31,832 --> 00:10:33,629
She doesn't call
when she says she will.

175
00:10:33,881 --> 00:10:37,271
She won't let me sleep over.
She's obviously seeing other guys.

176
00:10:37,604 --> 00:10:39,674
So why can't I get her
out of my head?

177
00:10:39,945 --> 00:10:44,655
Okay, that's not where I was going,
but let's review:

178
00:10:45,048 --> 00:10:48,757
She's gorgeous,
but she's also self-centered...

179
00:10:49,104 --> 00:10:51,538
she's promiscuous,
she's commitment-phobic...

180
00:10:51,823 --> 00:10:53,939
- Oh, my God.
- What?

181
00:10:54,207 --> 00:10:57,244
I'm dating myself.

182
00:11:00,062 --> 00:11:02,781
No wonder the sex is so good.

183
00:11:08,217 --> 00:11:10,333
Trust me. You'll feel better
having this done.

184
00:11:10,601 --> 00:11:13,559
- We'll have the weekend to have fun.
- What if we don't have fun?

185
00:11:13,863 --> 00:11:16,218
Then all this studying
will be for nothing.

186
00:11:17,208 --> 00:11:19,483
That's just a risk we'll have to take.

187
00:11:19,759 --> 00:11:22,398
Now, what year did Magellan
circumnavigate the globe?

188
00:11:22,687 --> 00:11:24,837
- It's not gonna be on the test.
- Maybe not.

189
00:11:25,113 --> 00:11:26,705
It wouldn't hurt
for you to know it.

190
00:11:26,953 --> 00:11:29,183
Why would I wanna know
something I don't have to?

191
00:11:29,462 --> 00:11:31,976
Because maybe you'll need
to know it in the future.

192
00:11:32,264 --> 00:11:34,494
Well, then, that's when I'll learn it.

193
00:11:35,735 --> 00:11:37,293
Why can't you just learn it now?

194
00:11:37,533 --> 00:11:39,649
There's only
so much space in my brain...

195
00:11:39,917 --> 00:11:44,433
that if you put Magellan in there,
I might forget my locker combination.

196
00:11:46,567 --> 00:11:49,240
- Charlie, help me out here.
- What?

197
00:11:49,536 --> 00:11:52,334
Jake doesn't think he needs
to know anything about Magellan.

198
00:11:52,631 --> 00:11:54,303
What's Magellan?

199
00:11:56,688 --> 00:11:58,963
Okay, I'm out of here.
Won't be late.

200
00:11:59,239 --> 00:12:03,027
Oh, I'm sorry.
Bad news from the clinic?

201
00:12:04,383 --> 00:12:07,216
No. I'm just taking
Sherri out for a nice dinner...

202
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:09,749
after which I plan to
gently but firmly...

203
00:12:10,029 --> 00:12:12,099
extricate myself
from the relationship.

204
00:12:12,998 --> 00:12:14,954
So she got bad news from the clinic?

205
00:12:16,386 --> 00:12:18,183
There's no bad news.
There's no clinic.

206
00:12:18,435 --> 00:12:20,107
- I'm just ending it.
- Why?

207
00:12:20,359 --> 00:12:22,953
Because she's a self-centered,
manipulative narcissist.

208
00:12:23,244 --> 00:12:25,235
So are you.

209
00:12:26,130 --> 00:12:27,882
Hello.

210
00:12:30,981 --> 00:12:32,494
He said "narcissist."

211
00:12:33,867 --> 00:12:36,017
It's not a dirty word.

212
00:12:37,505 --> 00:12:38,984
What does it mean?

213
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:41,529
If you wanna know,
look it up in the dictionary.

214
00:12:41,813 --> 00:12:43,405
Okay.

215
00:12:51,725 --> 00:12:54,193
He's not coming back.

216
00:12:58,290 --> 00:13:01,009
- Thank you, Steven.
- It's "Stephan."

217
00:13:01,302 --> 00:13:02,815
Sure, it is.

218
00:13:07,742 --> 00:13:10,302
Listen, Sherri, we need to talk.

219
00:13:10,586 --> 00:13:15,137
- You're a terrific woman, but...
- You look so hot tonight.

220
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:17,004
Really?

221
00:13:21,376 --> 00:13:25,972
- That was incredible.
- Yeah, it was, wasn't it?

222
00:13:26,353 --> 00:13:28,264
It's funny how things work out.

223
00:13:28,527 --> 00:13:30,882
An hour ago I wasn't
feeling too good about us.

224
00:13:31,162 --> 00:13:33,039
I gotta get up
early again tomorrow.

225
00:13:33,295 --> 00:13:34,853
So if you don't mind...

226
00:13:41,325 --> 00:13:44,203
There you go, Elvis.
Peanut butter and bananas.

227
00:13:46,050 --> 00:13:48,610
- My mom cuts it diagonally.
- Yeah?

228
00:13:48,894 --> 00:13:51,931
Well, that's the way
I learned to cut it in prison.

229
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:55,354
Thank you?

230
00:13:59,015 --> 00:14:02,007
Alan, got a riddle for you:

231
00:14:02,319 --> 00:14:05,277
What's short, picky and only
supposed to be here on weekends?

232
00:14:05,581 --> 00:14:08,015
I'll give you a hint: It's your kid.

233
00:14:09,219 --> 00:14:10,937
I know. I know.
His mother decided...

234
00:14:11,185 --> 00:14:13,983
she had to go to Palm Springs
to rejuvenate herself.

235
00:14:14,782 --> 00:14:16,454
Detox?

236
00:14:17,291 --> 00:14:19,407
No, a health spa.
Six hundred dollars a day...

237
00:14:19,675 --> 00:14:21,791
for meditation and colonics.

238
00:14:22,602 --> 00:14:24,194
How in the hell do you meditate...

239
00:14:24,442 --> 00:14:27,752
when someone's
squirting water up your business?

240
00:14:29,461 --> 00:14:32,021
I don't think they
happen simultaneously, Berta.

241
00:14:32,305 --> 00:14:35,138
That's good, because
it could be very distracting.

242
00:14:35,441 --> 00:14:38,638
I can't even pee
when the cat's watching me.

243
00:14:41,213 --> 00:14:43,249
Nobody answer the phone!

244
00:14:43,513 --> 00:14:46,152
Please, let it be her.
Please, please, please.

245
00:14:49,117 --> 00:14:51,187
No, wait.
Berta, you answer it.

246
00:14:51,710 --> 00:14:53,860
No, no, no! Let it ring.

247
00:14:54,345 --> 00:14:56,654
No, answer it.

248
00:14:56,938 --> 00:14:58,815
- Harper residence.
- I'm not here.

249
00:14:59,071 --> 00:15:01,426
- Yeah, he's here.
- Okay, I'm here.

250
00:15:01,998 --> 00:15:03,829
Jake, it's your mother!

251
00:15:05,511 --> 00:15:09,743
So how's it going down there?
You struck oil yet?

252
00:15:12,453 --> 00:15:14,728
Charlie, what is going on with you?

253
00:15:15,339 --> 00:15:18,012
- What?
- What do you mean, "what"?

254
00:15:18,308 --> 00:15:20,663
You're spending half your time
drinking and moping.

255
00:15:20,943 --> 00:15:22,774
The other half sleeping
and throwing up.

256
00:15:23,034 --> 00:15:25,184
You haven't been
out of the house all week.

257
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:28,577
You want me
to go out like this in public?

258
00:15:29,433 --> 00:15:32,709
If you feel so strongly about this girl,
why don't you just call her?

259
00:15:33,029 --> 00:15:35,020
Yeah, sure, I could call her.

260
00:15:35,288 --> 00:15:38,519
I could also FedEx her my testicles
in a little silk bag.

261
00:15:40,432 --> 00:15:43,822
All the more reason to call first
and give her a heads-up.

262
00:15:44,154 --> 00:15:47,112
Alan, don't you understand?
This isn't about dating anymore.

263
00:15:47,416 --> 00:15:50,965
It's not even about sex.
It's about self-respect and pride.

264
00:15:51,556 --> 00:15:55,026
Yeah, well, I think
that ship has sailed, Charlie.

265
00:15:55,613 --> 00:15:59,367
See, the problem is
she doesn't need me.

266
00:16:00,046 --> 00:16:02,514
So I need to figure out
a way to show her...

267
00:16:02,806 --> 00:16:05,604
that I don't need her just as much
as she doesn't need me.

268
00:16:05,901 --> 00:16:08,017
But without seeming needy.

269
00:16:10,334 --> 00:16:12,450
You see my dilemma?

270
00:16:13,262 --> 00:16:15,617
Actually, I think I do.

271
00:16:15,896 --> 00:16:19,172
You feel like I felt
when Judith kicked me out.

272
00:16:20,371 --> 00:16:23,249
All right, if you're gonna mock me,
this conversation's over.

273
00:16:27,564 --> 00:16:31,193
- Who took my sandwich?
- Go do your homework.

274
00:16:32,374 --> 00:16:34,683
Unbelievable.

275
00:16:38,229 --> 00:16:41,426
- I'm glad you were free tonight.
- I'm glad I was home when you called.

276
00:16:41,742 --> 00:16:44,131
I would've called sooner,
but it's been a crazy week.

277
00:16:44,418 --> 00:16:46,170
It's okay. I understand.

278
00:16:46,426 --> 00:16:48,656
- Oh, Charlie, I want you.
- Are you sure?

279
00:16:48,935 --> 00:16:50,971
- Oh, yeah.
- How much?

280
00:16:51,235 --> 00:16:53,590
- Can't you tell?
- I wanna hear it.

281
00:16:53,870 --> 00:16:55,986
I need you. I ache for you.

282
00:16:56,714 --> 00:16:58,750
Okay, then.

283
00:17:01,607 --> 00:17:03,723
- What are you doing?
- I've gotta get home.

284
00:17:03,991 --> 00:17:05,663
I got an early meeting.

285
00:17:07,588 --> 00:17:10,056
- What?
- Beat you to it this time, didn't I?

286
00:17:11,435 --> 00:17:14,586
What are you talk...? What kind
of game are you playing here?

287
00:17:14,906 --> 00:17:18,615
The same game you're playing,
only tonight, I win.

288
00:17:19,548 --> 00:17:21,345
Really? What is it that you're winning?

289
00:17:21,598 --> 00:17:25,068
Charlie, I'm lying here hungry for
your body and you're walking away.

290
00:17:25,403 --> 00:17:28,156
So, what exactly is it
that you're winning?

291
00:17:33,559 --> 00:17:35,311
You know.

292
00:17:37,448 --> 00:17:39,279
- Get out.
- It's too late.

293
00:17:39,539 --> 00:17:42,099
You can't kick me out.
I already said I'm leaving.

294
00:17:57,564 --> 00:17:59,441
Hey.

295
00:17:59,697 --> 00:18:02,689
- So how'd it go?
- Great.

296
00:18:03,001 --> 00:18:05,674
I took control.
I regained my self-respect.

297
00:18:05,970 --> 00:18:08,086
I walked out of there
with my head held high.

298
00:18:08,354 --> 00:18:12,108
Good for you. Good for you.
So you're done beating yourself up?

299
00:18:13,247 --> 00:18:14,919
Not quite.

300
00:18:24,246 --> 00:18:26,043
Jake, wait till we get inside.

301
00:18:27,383 --> 00:18:30,341
I'm hungry.
Uncle Charlie's in there.

302
00:18:31,607 --> 00:18:33,040
I see your point.

303
00:18:33,279 --> 00:18:35,588
At the risk of asking
a foolish question...

304
00:18:35,872 --> 00:18:37,510
you got any homework
this weekend?

305
00:18:37,754 --> 00:18:40,826
- Nope. Did it at school.
- Really?

306
00:18:41,142 --> 00:18:46,455
- Yup. Did it during detention.
- Jake, why did you have detention?

307
00:18:46,871 --> 00:18:49,066
Because I didn't
do my homework yesterday.

308
00:18:49,883 --> 00:18:52,602
So you did yesterday's homework
and today's homework?

309
00:18:52,894 --> 00:18:55,169
Yup. The extra-credit section
and everything.

310
00:18:55,445 --> 00:18:59,882
- Oh, great. I'll look it over.
- Okay, I didn't do it.

311
00:19:01,174 --> 00:19:04,564
- Jake, why do you keep lying?
- Because I thought you trusted me.

312
00:19:07,113 --> 00:19:09,946
The detention part was true.

313
00:19:13,219 --> 00:19:15,096
Hi, Charlie.

314
00:19:15,352 --> 00:19:17,912
Hey, Rose. What's going on?

315
00:19:18,196 --> 00:19:21,074
I just stopped by to say I'm sorry
things didn't work out...

316
00:19:21,374 --> 00:19:24,207
with you and Sherri.
- Yeah. Thanks.

317
00:19:24,511 --> 00:19:27,309
And I'm sorry for my
schadenfreude the other day.

318
00:19:27,605 --> 00:19:30,881
I've been riddled with
"glaukenschtuken" ever since.

319
00:19:31,202 --> 00:19:33,841
- Glauken...?
- Schtuken.

320
00:19:34,129 --> 00:19:37,724
It means: " Feeling guilty
for having felt schadenfreude."

321
00:19:38,479 --> 00:19:40,435
- They've got a word for that?
- Not yet.

322
00:19:40,695 --> 00:19:43,528
But I'm hoping
"glaukenschtuken" catches on.

323
00:19:44,878 --> 00:19:47,153
I'll do my part.

324
00:19:48,181 --> 00:19:51,457
You know, something good
did come out of all this:

325
00:19:52,238 --> 00:19:54,149
Watching you obsess over Sherri...

326
00:19:54,413 --> 00:19:57,246
really helped me understand
my obsession for you.

327
00:19:57,549 --> 00:20:01,337
I mean, you never return my calls.
You always see other women.

328
00:20:01,690 --> 00:20:03,760
You never knowingly
let me sleep over.

329
00:20:05,872 --> 00:20:09,387
And yet, I've never been able
to get you out of my head.

330
00:20:10,681 --> 00:20:12,558
- Interesting.
- Isn't it?

331
00:20:12,814 --> 00:20:17,444
But now that I understand it,
I feel somehow free of it.

332
00:20:18,084 --> 00:20:21,394
Well, that's great, Rose. It sounds
like a real healthy breakthrough.

333
00:20:21,722 --> 00:20:26,318
Yeah. And the best part is now
that the fog of obsession has lifted...

334
00:20:26,699 --> 00:20:31,136
I can stop idealizing you,
and see you for who you really are.

335
00:20:32,512 --> 00:20:34,662
And who would that be?

336
00:20:34,938 --> 00:20:38,977
An emotionally scarred
and deeply flawed human being.

337
00:20:39,914 --> 00:20:42,712
Who will one day bless me...

338
00:20:43,009 --> 00:20:47,048
with emotionally scarred
and deeply flawed children.

339
00:20:49,282 --> 00:20:50,601
Rose.

340
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:54,147
Just hold me.

341
00:20:56,643 --> 00:20:59,999
I like the names Mike and Trudy.
