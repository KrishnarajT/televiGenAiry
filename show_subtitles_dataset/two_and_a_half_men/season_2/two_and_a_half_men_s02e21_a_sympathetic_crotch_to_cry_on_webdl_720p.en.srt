1
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:14,632
Jake, use your spoon.

2
00:00:14,923 --> 00:00:16,914
Can't. I'll die.

3
00:00:17,769 --> 00:00:20,283
If you don't turn off that music,
you'll die anyway.

4
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:22,869
Fine.

5
00:00:33,714 --> 00:00:35,466
That's better.

6
00:00:36,183 --> 00:00:38,572
He's still gonna be living here
when he's, like, 30.

7
00:00:38,903 --> 00:00:41,622
My big fear is he'll still be
in fifth grade.

8
00:00:41,959 --> 00:00:46,191
Hello, anybody home?
Grandmommy's here.

9
00:00:50,119 --> 00:00:52,349
There's my grandson.

10
00:01:25,399 --> 00:01:29,472
So, Mom, to what do we owe
this unexpected...

11
00:01:29,877 --> 00:01:32,072
- Pleasure?
- No, that's not it.

12
00:01:33,434 --> 00:01:36,870
I was showing a house, and
I thought I'd visit the people I love.

13
00:01:37,452 --> 00:01:38,805
And they weren't home?

14
00:01:50,216 --> 00:01:54,209
Goody. There's a Tudor on Stone Canyon
that's going on the market soon.

15
00:01:54,611 --> 00:01:57,603
- How do you know?
- Owner dropped dead of a heart attack.

16
00:01:57,917 --> 00:01:59,396
You know what they say, darling.

17
00:01:59,633 --> 00:02:02,306
Today's obituary
is tomorrow's exclusive listing.

18
00:02:04,362 --> 00:02:07,434
Father of five in Westwood.
I'm on fire.

19
00:02:08,296 --> 00:02:09,729
You will be soon.

20
00:02:12,146 --> 00:02:14,819
Mom, you're not setting
a very good example here.

21
00:02:15,159 --> 00:02:16,797
Why?

22
00:02:17,042 --> 00:02:20,717
Jake, honey, your grandmommy performs
a very important public service.

23
00:02:21,102 --> 00:02:23,570
When people die,
their families are very, very sad...

24
00:02:23,864 --> 00:02:26,253
and they have no idea
what their homes are worth.

25
00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:28,444
And you tell them?

26
00:02:29,681 --> 00:02:31,433
Oh, you are so cute.

27
00:02:33,657 --> 00:02:36,490
And Grandmommy doesn't just
prey on the dead, Jake.

28
00:02:36,796 --> 00:02:40,345
She also profits from the pain of divorce
and the humiliation of bankruptcy.

29
00:02:42,069 --> 00:02:46,028
Not to mention she's working on an
alternative fuel made from puppies.

30
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:48,974
Oh, my God. Harry Gorsky died.

31
00:02:49,309 --> 00:02:51,027
Oh, no. Are you sure it's him?

32
00:02:51,318 --> 00:02:54,355
How many Harry Luther Gorskys
are there in Los Angeles?

33
00:02:54,708 --> 00:02:57,461
- Well, there's one less now.
- Who are you talking about?

34
00:02:57,805 --> 00:03:00,239
He was Uncle Charlie's
and my stepdad.

35
00:03:00,567 --> 00:03:03,206
- The first of three, and not my favorite.
- I liked him.

36
00:03:03,538 --> 00:03:06,291
Oh, please. You were 6.
You still liked Mom.

37
00:03:08,728 --> 00:03:11,800
- Mom, are you okay?
- No, I'm not okay.

38
00:03:12,117 --> 00:03:14,073
He was a good man...

39
00:03:14,336 --> 00:03:17,487
and part of my life,
and now he's gone.

40
00:03:17,809 --> 00:03:19,765
I just pray he died peacefully...

41
00:03:20,069 --> 00:03:23,106
and held on to that stately
six-bedroom, four-bath Colonial...

42
00:03:23,417 --> 00:03:25,408
in Hancock Park...

43
00:03:26,598 --> 00:03:30,273
with the bonus office/guest room
over the garage.

44
00:03:37,939 --> 00:03:39,213
Let me get this straight.

45
00:03:39,446 --> 00:03:42,040
First there was your dad,
then this guy Harry who died...

46
00:03:42,333 --> 00:03:44,403
then the fat guy
with the carpet business.

47
00:03:44,719 --> 00:03:47,836
No, no, no. The fat guy came after
the twitchy gay guy from Texas...

48
00:03:48,151 --> 00:03:50,984
who gave us crew cuts
and called us buckaroos.

49
00:03:51,331 --> 00:03:52,605
So out of the three...

50
00:03:52,838 --> 00:03:55,352
Harry was the best.
- I liked the fat guy, remember?

51
00:03:55,642 --> 00:03:57,792
With the chubby daughter
who was so grateful?

52
00:03:59,366 --> 00:04:02,722
All you had to do was knock on her door
with some Turkish Taffy.

53
00:04:03,593 --> 00:04:06,551
Be that as it may,
he was still a very good father to us.

54
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:08,492
Oh, please. He was a little tyrant.

55
00:04:08,741 --> 00:04:10,493
"Sit up straight."
"Do your homework."

56
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:13,503
"Quit forging my signature
on hotel bills."

57
00:04:14,223 --> 00:04:15,941
Okay, then. The funeral is tomorrow.

58
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:19,387
I think it would be appropriate for us all
to go and pay our respects.

59
00:04:19,748 --> 00:04:21,625
I don't know.
Tomorrow's not good for me.

60
00:04:21,924 --> 00:04:25,200
Oh, Charlie. The man was your father.

61
00:04:25,565 --> 00:04:26,998
No, he was not.

62
00:04:27,239 --> 00:04:29,195
Why do you care so much?
You divorced him.

63
00:04:29,499 --> 00:04:32,775
Just because you divorce doesn't mean
you no longer have feelings.

64
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:35,210
That's true.
Judith still has feelings for me.

65
00:04:35,734 --> 00:04:38,373
Pity is not really a feeling, Alan.

66
00:04:41,175 --> 00:04:46,203
Regardless of our feelings, we'll still go
and say our final goodbyes to Harry.

67
00:04:46,741 --> 00:04:48,732
- I'm not going.
- Me neither.

68
00:04:49,001 --> 00:04:52,437
- Fine, you stay here with Uncle Charlie.
- Cool.

69
00:04:53,395 --> 00:04:56,273
Yeah, cool.
Why do you wanna go?

70
00:04:56,785 --> 00:04:59,219
I think it's the right thing to do,
and I liked Harry.

71
00:04:59,547 --> 00:05:01,378
- And he liked you.
- I know.

72
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:03,437
We've stayed in touch over the years.

73
00:05:03,732 --> 00:05:05,324
What?

74
00:05:06,411 --> 00:05:10,370
You betrayed me by communicating with
that son of a bitch after I divorced him?

75
00:05:11,475 --> 00:05:13,067
Well, wait a minute.
You said that...

76
00:05:13,358 --> 00:05:14,711
I know what I said.

77
00:05:16,078 --> 00:05:19,787
I was just being polite because
the guy's worm chow.

78
00:05:20,472 --> 00:05:23,305
All I did was send him Christmas cards
and a picture of Jake.

79
00:05:23,904 --> 00:05:27,055
- You never send me a picture of Jake.
- He's right here.

80
00:05:27,419 --> 00:05:29,535
When was the last time
I got a Christmas card?

81
00:05:29,847 --> 00:05:32,919
Wait, I'm on your side.
Charlie's the one who doesn't wanna go.

82
00:05:33,279 --> 00:05:36,589
I don't even know if I want
you to come now. You've ruined it.

83
00:05:37,589 --> 00:05:40,706
- How can you ruin a funeral?
- I don't wanna talk about it anymore.

84
00:05:41,063 --> 00:05:43,418
- Where are you going?
- I need something black.

85
00:05:43,741 --> 00:05:45,652
Doesn't your soul qualify?

86
00:05:48,010 --> 00:05:52,720
Laugh now, but when I die,
I will be coming back to haunt you.

87
00:05:54,664 --> 00:05:57,622
How will that be any different
than this?

88
00:06:02,909 --> 00:06:05,582
Okay, Jake.
I'm going to pick up your grandmother.

89
00:06:05,922 --> 00:06:07,480
Okay.

90
00:06:08,433 --> 00:06:10,503
You think maybe
you've played that enough?

91
00:06:10,818 --> 00:06:11,967
Okay.

92
00:06:12,743 --> 00:06:15,303
I might as well just buy him
a crack pipe.

93
00:06:15,715 --> 00:06:17,592
Hey!

94
00:06:18,226 --> 00:06:20,979
- Let's get this over with.
- You're coming to the funeral?

95
00:06:21,281 --> 00:06:24,353
I thought about it and realized,
even if I didn't like the guy...

96
00:06:24,671 --> 00:06:27,139
that shouldn't stop me from
going to his funeral...

97
00:06:27,433 --> 00:06:29,424
and, you know, taking a victory lap.

98
00:06:29,735 --> 00:06:31,726
Charlie, you're not
gonna wanna hear this...

99
00:06:31,995 --> 00:06:33,792
but you sound a lot like Mom.

100
00:06:34,757 --> 00:06:37,271
Tread lightly.

101
00:06:37,895 --> 00:06:40,250
- Jake, you're coming with us.
- I don't wanna.

102
00:06:40,574 --> 00:06:42,087
You get to see a real dead guy.

103
00:06:42,373 --> 00:06:45,331
There's gonna be a dead guy? Where?

104
00:06:46,098 --> 00:06:49,852
- At the funeral.
- Oh, cool. Can I come?

105
00:06:51,162 --> 00:06:53,198
Did I say he was gonna
live here until 30?

106
00:06:53,464 --> 00:06:54,738
I meant forever.

107
00:06:55,849 --> 00:06:57,441
What are you talking about?

108
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:03,498
- Go put on your nice clothes.
- Okay.

109
00:07:05,726 --> 00:07:08,604
He doesn't know
what nice clothes are.

110
00:07:15,895 --> 00:07:18,807
- Jake?
- Oh, right.

111
00:07:22,466 --> 00:07:24,377
Isn't it a little early to start drinking?

112
00:07:24,684 --> 00:07:27,517
- Would you like a snort?
- That's what I meant.

113
00:07:30,543 --> 00:07:32,022
Thanks.

114
00:07:33,389 --> 00:07:34,742
You okay, Mom?

115
00:07:34,979 --> 00:07:37,174
I just can't believe he's gone.

116
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:40,880
Isn't that why we're going
to the funeral? To make sure?

117
00:07:41,717 --> 00:07:46,154
I'm confused. If you cared for Harry
so much, how come you left him?

118
00:07:46,655 --> 00:07:49,488
Yes, well, about that.

119
00:07:51,092 --> 00:07:55,483
I may have glossed over the details
with you boys just a skosh.

120
00:07:55,904 --> 00:08:01,024
I didn't actually leave Harry
so much as he left me.

121
00:08:01,889 --> 00:08:04,198
- You're kidding.
- He met a younger woman...

122
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:07,317
and just traded me in.

123
00:08:07,622 --> 00:08:09,772
You still loved him, didn't you?

124
00:08:11,598 --> 00:08:13,953
I loved him very much.

125
00:08:16,285 --> 00:08:21,154
Oh, Harry. My sweet, dear Harry.

126
00:08:21,559 --> 00:08:23,914
All right. Level eight.

127
00:08:32,774 --> 00:08:34,685
So where's the dead guy?

128
00:08:36,332 --> 00:08:38,209
Jake, show a little respect.

129
00:08:38,801 --> 00:08:40,837
Where's the dead guy, sir?

130
00:08:41,772 --> 00:08:44,047
In the chapel. Now keep it down.

131
00:08:44,367 --> 00:08:46,756
I think I can smell him.

132
00:08:48,887 --> 00:08:51,242
Oh, Lord. There she is.

133
00:08:51,523 --> 00:08:54,560
- Who?
- The tramp who stole my husband.

134
00:08:56,797 --> 00:08:58,594
Not bad.

135
00:08:59,433 --> 00:09:01,469
Not good.

136
00:09:02,488 --> 00:09:04,240
I'm gonna go mourn.

137
00:09:05,334 --> 00:09:08,007
- Yeah, me too.
- Stay put. Mommy needs you.

138
00:09:08,347 --> 00:09:10,907
- Hello, Evelyn.
- Hello, Christine.

139
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:14,670
- This is my son, Alan.
- Hello.

140
00:09:15,043 --> 00:09:17,637
And who's this little guy?
Your grandson?

141
00:09:17,973 --> 00:09:20,362
I'm just here to see the dead guy.

142
00:09:21,321 --> 00:09:24,950
Yes, I've been blessed with
both children and grandchildren.

143
00:09:25,297 --> 00:09:27,572
How about you? Oh, wait, I remember.

144
00:09:27,849 --> 00:09:30,238
You were slightly less fertile
than a sand trap.

145
00:09:32,202 --> 00:09:34,193
We're very sorry for your loss.

146
00:09:34,504 --> 00:09:38,338
It's not my loss.
He left me for that tramp over there.

147
00:09:40,656 --> 00:09:42,692
She doesn't look very unhappy,
does she?

148
00:09:42,999 --> 00:09:45,991
She just met him. Wait a week.

149
00:09:50,574 --> 00:09:54,772
I think it's the responsibility of we,
the living, to carry on...

150
00:09:55,136 --> 00:09:57,730
to live life to the fullest.
Embrace it.

151
00:09:58,024 --> 00:10:00,379
Kiss it on the mouth, if you will.

152
00:10:00,953 --> 00:10:03,547
Excuse me, Charlie,
can I talk to you for a minute?

153
00:10:03,841 --> 00:10:06,150
Sure. Heather,
this is my brother, Alan.

154
00:10:06,435 --> 00:10:09,552
He lives with me
at my beach house in Malibu.

155
00:10:10,286 --> 00:10:12,163
- Hi.
- I'm sorry for your loss.

156
00:10:12,462 --> 00:10:14,373
- Thank you.
- Alan came to live with me...

157
00:10:14,638 --> 00:10:19,268
at my Malibu beach house
when he lost his wife.

158
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:21,093
It's a healing house.

159
00:10:23,134 --> 00:10:25,329
My wife isn't really dead.

160
00:10:25,854 --> 00:10:28,049
Because you healed.

161
00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:32,663
At my Malibu beach house.

162
00:10:34,684 --> 00:10:37,517
And when you think about it,
Harry isn't really dead either.

163
00:10:38,158 --> 00:10:41,707
He lives right here...

164
00:10:42,050 --> 00:10:43,324
in all of us.

165
00:10:44,059 --> 00:10:48,575
- Thank you.
- Good. Let go.

166
00:10:48,955 --> 00:10:51,025
It's good to let go.

167
00:10:51,299 --> 00:10:53,017
Charlie.

168
00:10:54,061 --> 00:10:56,211
Excuse me a moment.

169
00:10:56,698 --> 00:10:59,132
What, what, what, what, what?

170
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:01,098
What do you mean,
"What, what, what"?

171
00:11:01,343 --> 00:11:04,574
- You're hitting on the widow.
- No, I'm consoling the widow.

172
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:07,095
I won't hit on her
until they close the lid.

173
00:11:07,955 --> 00:11:09,946
Unbelievable.
How do you sleep at night?

174
00:11:10,257 --> 00:11:12,976
Usually drunk and on top of somebody.

175
00:11:13,312 --> 00:11:16,031
But that takes work, Alan.
Doesn't just happen by itself.

176
00:11:16,828 --> 00:11:19,501
Here's an idea. Why don't you run
to the embalming room...

177
00:11:19,799 --> 00:11:22,632
and see if you can score a couple
fresh ones off the truck?

178
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:25,096
Excuse me,
but considering your ex-wife...

179
00:11:25,365 --> 00:11:29,358
I'd say you're the expert on having sex
with cold women who don't move.

180
00:11:30,764 --> 00:11:34,439
Nevertheless, you can
hit on women anywhere.

181
00:11:34,781 --> 00:11:36,578
Why did you bother to come?

182
00:11:37,418 --> 00:11:38,851
I don't know. I just did.

183
00:11:39,134 --> 00:11:41,853
- That's it? No reason?
- Do you have a reason for everything?

184
00:11:42,147 --> 00:11:44,342
- Yes.
- So how's that working out for you?

185
00:11:45,579 --> 00:11:47,456
I know how difficult it must be...

186
00:11:47,713 --> 00:11:52,150
rambling around all by yourself in that
big, drafty, six-bedroom Colonial...

187
00:11:52,568 --> 00:11:55,162
with the guest room/office
over the garage.

188
00:11:55,497 --> 00:11:57,692
Harry gave me a potbellied pig.

189
00:11:58,008 --> 00:11:59,521
So you'd remember him, sure.

190
00:11:59,766 --> 00:12:02,326
But I know Harry would want you
to move on...

191
00:12:02,612 --> 00:12:04,921
and this is the perfect time
to move on...

192
00:12:05,248 --> 00:12:07,682
because this is a seller's market.
- Excuse me.

193
00:12:07,969 --> 00:12:09,368
Can we talk to you a minute?

194
00:12:10,019 --> 00:12:11,816
Pardon me, dear.

195
00:12:12,572 --> 00:12:14,608
What? I'm working here.

196
00:12:15,251 --> 00:12:16,764
That woman just lost her husband.

197
00:12:17,050 --> 00:12:20,326
Alan, the man was 50 years old
when she was born.

198
00:12:20,649 --> 00:12:24,005
- So?
- So she had to see it coming.

199
00:12:25,630 --> 00:12:27,382
Even for you, that is really cold.

200
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:30,148
Oh, Mr. Graveside Nookie weighs in.

201
00:12:30,442 --> 00:12:33,673
You were trying to give the widow
a sympathetic crotch to cry on.

202
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,719
Hey, watch your mouth.
This is a solemn event.

203
00:12:37,055 --> 00:12:38,454
Yeah, show a little class.

204
00:12:38,729 --> 00:12:42,039
Me? I'm the only one here
behaving appropriately.

205
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:43,644
Hey, where's Jake?

206
00:13:01,202 --> 00:13:04,638
- Jake.
- How do you know my name?

207
00:13:06,475 --> 00:13:08,227
- It's okay.
- Okay?

208
00:13:08,484 --> 00:13:11,237
I almost pooped my pants.

209
00:13:12,544 --> 00:13:14,262
What are you doing?

210
00:13:15,808 --> 00:13:17,799
I just wanted to see.

211
00:13:19,365 --> 00:13:21,276
Okay, well, let's... Let's take a look.

212
00:13:21,583 --> 00:13:25,178
- Really?
- Yeah. Come on.

213
00:13:32,967 --> 00:13:35,765
- What do you think?
- I don't know.

214
00:13:36,064 --> 00:13:39,215
- How did he die?
- He just got old.

215
00:13:39,537 --> 00:13:41,414
His heart stopped.

216
00:13:42,885 --> 00:13:45,160
His watch is still going.

217
00:13:46,861 --> 00:13:50,092
- Yep.
- Why would he need a watch, anyway?

218
00:13:50,418 --> 00:13:53,137
It's not like he's gonna be
late for anything.

219
00:13:53,976 --> 00:13:56,888
Okay, there are other people waiting
to pay their respects.

220
00:13:57,198 --> 00:13:59,268
Why don't we go find Grandma?

221
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:06,948
I don't care what anybody says.

222
00:14:07,577 --> 00:14:09,295
I always thought you were a good guy.

223
00:14:09,544 --> 00:14:12,104
Thanks, Alan.

224
00:14:15,696 --> 00:14:18,290
Want to know what time it is?

225
00:14:21,932 --> 00:14:22,921
Let's go.

226
00:14:26,326 --> 00:14:27,600
- How's he look?
- Dead.

227
00:14:27,832 --> 00:14:29,629
Cool.

228
00:14:40,722 --> 00:14:42,599
Surprise.

229
00:14:45,577 --> 00:14:49,331
Listen, I just wanted to tell you
that I've been thinking about it...

230
00:14:49,678 --> 00:14:53,193
and maybe some of the stuff
between us may have been my fault.

231
00:14:53,529 --> 00:14:55,804
I was angry about losing my dad,
and I guess...

232
00:14:56,081 --> 00:14:58,356
you were the guy I took it out on.

233
00:14:58,676 --> 00:15:01,509
Anyway, not that it makes
a lot of difference at this point...

234
00:15:01,815 --> 00:15:06,684
but I just wanted you to know
that I'm sorry.

235
00:15:11,817 --> 00:15:14,490
By the way, I'm gonna take a shot
at your wife.

236
00:15:21,610 --> 00:15:23,521
But that's just a guy thing.

237
00:15:23,786 --> 00:15:26,459
Nothing personal, okay?

238
00:15:27,134 --> 00:15:29,364
I'll take that as a yes.

239
00:15:31,654 --> 00:15:35,727
And so with every door that God closes,
he opens a window.

240
00:15:36,927 --> 00:15:39,680
Did he say "window" or "widow"?

241
00:15:41,196 --> 00:15:44,632
Even as we say goodbye
to our beloved friend...

242
00:15:44,963 --> 00:15:46,555
Harry Luther Gorsky...

243
00:15:46,804 --> 00:15:49,523
we know that he lives on
in all of us.

244
00:15:49,817 --> 00:15:52,456
- How are you holding up?
- Okay.

245
00:15:52,747 --> 00:15:58,140
- Lf you need anything, I'm right here.
- Thank you. That's very comforting.

246
00:16:02,791 --> 00:16:04,429
For everything, there is a season.

247
00:16:04,716 --> 00:16:07,184
A time to be born, a time to die.

248
00:16:07,478 --> 00:16:10,515
A time to reap, a time to sow.

249
00:16:10,826 --> 00:16:12,498
So...

250
00:16:13,421 --> 00:16:15,377
I would like to invite anyone...

251
00:16:15,639 --> 00:16:17,914
who wishes to say a few words
about Harry...

252
00:16:18,192 --> 00:16:19,705
to come up and share with us.

253
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:25,452
As always, I'll do him first.

254
00:16:26,101 --> 00:16:28,740
- Mom, bad idea.
- Hey...

255
00:16:29,073 --> 00:16:33,510
if I didn't give in to bad ideas,
you wouldn't be here. Hold this.

256
00:16:35,894 --> 00:16:38,010
Dad. I can't find my Gameboy.

257
00:16:38,322 --> 00:16:40,358
Not now, Jake.

258
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:46,759
Hello. Welcome to Harry's funeral.

259
00:16:48,450 --> 00:16:51,522
I haven't seen him so drained
of bodily fluids since our honeymoon.

260
00:16:54,016 --> 00:16:56,735
What? I thought I'd open with a joke.

261
00:17:00,126 --> 00:17:02,515
My name is Evelyn Harper...

262
00:17:02,804 --> 00:17:08,242
or, as dear Harry used to call me,
his sweet little sugar tushy.

263
00:17:11,509 --> 00:17:13,420
When I first met Harry...

264
00:17:13,685 --> 00:17:17,598
I was just a hot young widow
with bills to pay...

265
00:17:17,954 --> 00:17:20,422
who could lick the chrome
off a trailer hitch.

266
00:17:21,888 --> 00:17:24,561
I also had two small boys...

267
00:17:24,901 --> 00:17:29,133
one of whom Harry cared for
very deeply.

268
00:17:29,505 --> 00:17:31,700
The other one was Charlie.

269
00:17:33,062 --> 00:17:36,179
It wasn't easy being
a substitute father...

270
00:17:36,494 --> 00:17:39,930
but Harry gave it his all.

271
00:17:40,553 --> 00:17:42,384
Unfortunately, it wasn't enough...

272
00:17:42,646 --> 00:17:45,240
which is probably why
he looked for solace...

273
00:17:45,533 --> 00:17:47,285
in the arms of a cheap slut.

274
00:17:49,216 --> 00:17:52,413
Stand up, Christine.
Let everybody have a look at you.

275
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:03,813
Take a good look, Heather.
That's gonna be you someday.

276
00:18:06,082 --> 00:18:10,519
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm being disrespectful
to the grieving widow.

277
00:18:10,895 --> 00:18:14,092
But, listen, you wanna talk grieving?
I'm grieving.

278
00:18:14,410 --> 00:18:18,801
I loved this man with all my heart,
and you left me, you lousy bastard.

279
00:18:19,223 --> 00:18:22,056
Well, take a good look.
I've still got a great ass...

280
00:18:22,362 --> 00:18:24,830
and yours is decomposing
as we speak.

281
00:18:27,467 --> 00:18:29,059
Thank you.

282
00:18:30,564 --> 00:18:33,442
- Okay. That was beautiful.
- Time to go.

283
00:18:33,787 --> 00:18:35,982
I'll call you.

284
00:18:36,298 --> 00:18:40,291
- Dad, what about my Gameboy?
- Forget it. Just keep walking.

285
00:18:41,529 --> 00:18:47,604
And so let's take a moment
of silent prayer for our friend, Harry.

286
00:19:01,952 --> 00:19:04,705
I am really, really sorry.

287
00:19:22,459 --> 00:19:24,017
Got it.

288
00:19:26,058 --> 00:19:30,256
It's my kid's. I don't know,
maybe I spoil him.

289
00:19:32,461 --> 00:19:34,611
Okay, bye.

290
00:19:40,203 --> 00:19:42,876
Boys, when I die...

291
00:19:43,175 --> 00:19:45,735
I want a simple funeral.
No tears.

292
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:47,817
- Done.
- You got it.

293
00:19:48,113 --> 00:19:50,308
And I wanna be buried
next to your father.

294
00:19:50,917 --> 00:19:52,191
Dad was cremated, Mom.

295
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:55,091
Oh, yes, right.

296
00:19:55,353 --> 00:19:57,628
I was thinking of someone else.

297
00:19:58,952 --> 00:20:01,785
So I take it you'd rather be
buried than cremated?

298
00:20:02,133 --> 00:20:04,488
Oh, can't we do both?

299
00:20:05,983 --> 00:20:09,259
I want to be buried
on the side of a hill...

300
00:20:09,624 --> 00:20:13,014
nestled amongst the willows,
overlooking the ocean.

301
00:20:13,642 --> 00:20:15,598
Do we get to pick the ocean?

302
00:20:16,697 --> 00:20:20,815
And I want an unadorned headstone,
which reads simply:

303
00:20:21,216 --> 00:20:25,414
"Evelyn Harper.
Loving wife, devoted mother."

304
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:28,539
That's good. Open with a joke.
