1
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:13,652
Crap.

2
00:00:15,489 --> 00:00:16,763
Oopsie.

3
00:00:17,914 --> 00:00:20,667
Oh, Charlie!

4
00:00:47,811 --> 00:00:50,450
Okay, I guess I'll give you a call.

5
00:00:57,638 --> 00:00:59,788
Alrighty, that'd be great.

6
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:08,337
Sounds good. Looking forward to it.

7
00:01:08,635 --> 00:01:09,988
Bye-bye now.

8
00:01:14,029 --> 00:01:15,860
Swell.

9
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:18,422
Hey, Alan. You know how to say:

10
00:01:18,712 --> 00:01:20,111
"Please go faster," in Polish?

11
00:01:25,068 --> 00:01:27,138
- Funny language, isn't it?
- Yeah, hilarious.

12
00:01:27,451 --> 00:01:30,284
The earthquake hit Sherman Oaks
a lot harder than Malibu.

13
00:01:30,629 --> 00:01:33,587
- What earthquake?
- What earthquake?

14
00:01:33,932 --> 00:01:36,366
About an hour ago.
You didn't feel the house shaking?

15
00:01:42,713 --> 00:01:44,988
Unbelievable.
You actually thought that was you?

16
00:01:45,306 --> 00:01:48,139
No, I thought it was her,
you know, because of me.

17
00:01:49,487 --> 00:01:52,081
The good news is,
unless they report it on Polish TV...

18
00:01:52,414 --> 00:01:53,893
I still get the credit.

19
00:01:54,798 --> 00:01:56,914
I'm thrilled for you.
Anyway, Judith called.

20
00:01:57,223 --> 00:01:59,578
A pipe broke,
soaked her living room carpet...

21
00:01:59,899 --> 00:02:01,651
and she's completely freaking out.

22
00:02:01,948 --> 00:02:05,099
Yeah, well, that's the difference
between wife and ex-wife.

23
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:08,497
With ex-wife, you don't even have to
pretend to care.

24
00:02:09,642 --> 00:02:11,553
Well, I'm sorry. I can't be that callous.

25
00:02:11,858 --> 00:02:13,610
Have you even tried?

26
00:02:14,534 --> 00:02:17,332
She's the mother of my son.
I'm concerned about her welfare.

27
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:19,740
I told her she could stay here
until repairs.

28
00:02:20,053 --> 00:02:22,328
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Back up. Back up.

29
00:02:22,646 --> 00:02:26,002
When you told her, did you have, like,
a sarcastic chuckle in your voice?

30
00:02:26,326 --> 00:02:29,602
Like, you know, " Yeah, right, Judith,
you can stay here."

31
00:02:30,256 --> 00:02:32,611
- It's just for a couple of days.
- A couple of days?

32
00:02:32,932 --> 00:02:35,400
Jack The Ripper just killed
a couple of prostitutes.

33
00:02:35,734 --> 00:02:37,008
It was still wrong.

34
00:02:37,281 --> 00:02:40,318
- Do you want me to put her in a hotel?
- Yeah, put her in a hotel.

35
00:02:40,668 --> 00:02:44,297
Put her in a space capsule. Put her
in a catapult and see how far she flies.

36
00:02:44,682 --> 00:02:46,240
Charlie, I can't do that to her.

37
00:02:46,522 --> 00:02:48,717
Again, have you even tried?

38
00:02:49,031 --> 00:02:52,546
- She's afraid of another quake.
- Well, what about what I'm afraid of?

39
00:02:52,919 --> 00:02:55,911
- What are you afraid of?
- Oh, let's see. Large birds. Small bugs.

40
00:02:56,265 --> 00:02:59,302
Unplanned pregnancies.
And your ex-wife living in my house.

41
00:02:59,986 --> 00:03:02,705
Come on, Charlie.
She's just a small, frightened woman.

42
00:03:03,039 --> 00:03:05,837
There are no small, frightened women.
That's a myth.

43
00:03:06,175 --> 00:03:09,326
Perpetrated by the large, angry
women who secretly run the world.

44
00:03:09,687 --> 00:03:12,963
I think it would be healthy for Jake
to see his mother and father...

45
00:03:13,325 --> 00:03:14,838
living together as friends.

46
00:03:15,123 --> 00:03:16,522
Oh, Alan, grow up.

47
00:03:16,795 --> 00:03:19,867
As long as he's got pizza with cheese
and TV with 150 channels...

48
00:03:20,182 --> 00:03:23,060
he doesn't give a rat's ass
what you guys do.

49
00:03:23,402 --> 00:03:25,438
Now that I think about it, neither do I.

50
00:03:28,043 --> 00:03:31,319
That had better be a big,
pregnant bird covered with spiders.

51
00:03:36,908 --> 00:03:39,502
- I don't know how to thank you.
- I'm glad you're okay.

52
00:03:39,835 --> 00:03:43,510
Charlie, I know this is a big imposition.
I really appreciate you inviting me.

53
00:03:47,529 --> 00:03:49,599
I thought she should know
this was your idea.

54
00:03:49,912 --> 00:03:52,380
Actually, I had several other ideas.
Wanna hear them?

55
00:03:53,592 --> 00:03:55,503
Tell Jake you're here.
I'll take your bags.

56
00:03:55,808 --> 00:03:57,287
Thank you, Alan. Thank you both.

57
00:03:57,523 --> 00:03:59,798
I promise I'll be out of here
in a couple of days.

58
00:04:07,307 --> 00:04:10,697
- Judith, sit down. I've got it covered.
- No. I can pitch in.

59
00:04:11,070 --> 00:04:13,948
Where do you keep the salad tongs?
Wait, I got them.

60
00:04:14,541 --> 00:04:16,975
- Better use the wooden ones.
- What's wrong with these?

61
00:04:17,259 --> 00:04:20,535
I use those whenever I drop my watch
in the toilet.

62
00:04:20,855 --> 00:04:22,254
This is a regular occurrence?

63
00:04:22,778 --> 00:04:26,566
- You'd think I'd learn.
- And you keep them in the kitchen?

64
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:30,748
I used to hang them in the bathroom,
but it freaked some chicks out.

65
00:04:31,768 --> 00:04:35,727
He's just kidding with you.
Use the wooden ones.

66
00:04:36,577 --> 00:04:37,896
I don't want any salad.

67
00:04:38,417 --> 00:04:41,250
- Well, you have to have some.
- Dad doesn't make me have salad.

68
00:04:41,595 --> 00:04:42,914
Alan?

69
00:04:43,184 --> 00:04:45,778
He's exaggerating.
We have salad all the time.

70
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,629
I just don't eat it.

71
00:04:49,163 --> 00:04:50,516
It's kind of our compromise.

72
00:04:50,794 --> 00:04:52,944
Okay. Fine.
Your house, your rules.

73
00:04:53,261 --> 00:04:55,616
Technically, it's my house, his rules.

74
00:04:55,937 --> 00:04:58,292
Of course.
Just have a little salad.

75
00:05:00,202 --> 00:05:02,113
So I spoke with
the plumbing company...

76
00:05:02,418 --> 00:05:04,249
and they'll be there in the morning.

77
00:05:04,551 --> 00:05:06,985
So I'll drop off Jake
and meet them on my way to work.

78
00:05:07,311 --> 00:05:09,063
- Thank you, Alan.
- You're welcome.

79
00:05:11,157 --> 00:05:12,670
This is really weird.

80
00:05:13,541 --> 00:05:17,216
Why? Your mom and I may not be living
together anymore, but we're still friends.

81
00:05:17,597 --> 00:05:20,634
I don't flip off my friends
when I talk to them on the phone.

82
00:05:23,284 --> 00:05:25,115
Nice shooting.

83
00:05:25,416 --> 00:05:26,974
Two with one bullet.

84
00:05:27,925 --> 00:05:30,837
Well, if either of us did,
in fact, do that, it was wrong.

85
00:05:31,186 --> 00:05:34,622
The important thing is we're making
an effort to be nicer to each other.

86
00:05:34,992 --> 00:05:38,109
That's right. And your mom staying here
is a good example of that.

87
00:05:38,462 --> 00:05:39,781
Very nicely put, Alan.

88
00:05:40,051 --> 00:05:42,963
If we leave now,
we can be in Mexico in two hours.

89
00:05:48,079 --> 00:05:49,558
Hey.

90
00:05:50,003 --> 00:05:51,356
Hey.

91
00:05:51,634 --> 00:05:53,545
- Where's Alan?
- Don't know.

92
00:05:55,439 --> 00:05:57,395
Mind if I join you?

93
00:05:58,868 --> 00:06:00,347
Sure.

94
00:06:10,576 --> 00:06:12,248
Thanks again for your hospitality.

95
00:06:12,917 --> 00:06:14,396
Don't mention it.

96
00:06:15,217 --> 00:06:17,936
You know, the TV in your room works.

97
00:06:19,147 --> 00:06:21,297
Oh, okay. Good to know.

98
00:06:25,294 --> 00:06:28,366
I just tucked Jake in.
He loves you very much.

99
00:06:28,723 --> 00:06:30,873
Yeah. I love him too.

100
00:06:31,984 --> 00:06:35,021
You got cable, satellite, DVD.
The whole shebang.

101
00:06:35,371 --> 00:06:37,282
Great.

102
00:06:40,347 --> 00:06:42,417
I'm surprised you're home
on a Saturday night.

103
00:06:42,731 --> 00:06:44,881
What, with your fun bachelor lifestyle.

104
00:06:45,198 --> 00:06:47,758
Well, I got laid this morning.

105
00:06:48,334 --> 00:06:50,894
So I thought I'd kick back tonight.

106
00:06:51,344 --> 00:06:54,336
Oh, my. Well, isn't that something.

107
00:06:55,819 --> 00:06:58,174
- Nice girl?
- I guess.

108
00:06:58,495 --> 00:06:59,974
She doesn't speak English.

109
00:07:01,923 --> 00:07:03,675
Well, hey.
What are you guys doing?

110
00:07:03,972 --> 00:07:05,405
Just watching a little TV.

111
00:07:05,687 --> 00:07:08,599
- What's on?
- I don't know. I just sat down.

112
00:07:13,255 --> 00:07:15,166
Oh, we've seen this movie before.

113
00:07:15,471 --> 00:07:16,870
- No, we didn't.
- Sure we have.

114
00:07:17,144 --> 00:07:19,533
That guy's girlfriend
turns out to be the murderer.

115
00:07:19,862 --> 00:07:22,740
Really? I did not know that.

116
00:07:23,081 --> 00:07:25,197
Oh, right. And she's not really a girl.

117
00:07:25,925 --> 00:07:28,280
I did not know that either.

118
00:07:29,688 --> 00:07:32,805
- When did we see this?
- The first movie after Jake was born.

119
00:07:33,159 --> 00:07:34,911
Oh, right.

120
00:07:35,208 --> 00:07:37,278
It was so hard to leave him
with the sitter.

121
00:07:37,591 --> 00:07:39,946
As soon as we got to the door,
the sobbing started.

122
00:07:40,267 --> 00:07:42,303
Yeah, well, it was hard for me.

123
00:07:42,609 --> 00:07:44,759
You were such a softy.

124
00:07:45,076 --> 00:07:46,668
Alcohol.

125
00:07:47,417 --> 00:07:49,214
While you're up,
you wanna make popcorn?

126
00:07:49,675 --> 00:07:51,074
- Sure.
- No butter for me.

127
00:07:51,348 --> 00:07:52,906
Got it.

128
00:07:57,620 --> 00:08:00,009
- Hey, Charlie.
- Hey, Rose.

129
00:08:18,318 --> 00:08:20,149
Anybody here?

130
00:08:21,914 --> 00:08:23,267
Good.

131
00:08:31,113 --> 00:08:32,626
Jeez.

132
00:08:33,413 --> 00:08:36,962
- I'm sorry. I thought you were asleep.
- That's all right. Relax.

133
00:08:37,929 --> 00:08:39,760
- You sure?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's fine.

134
00:08:40,062 --> 00:08:41,939
- Where's Alan?
- He took Jake to school...

135
00:08:42,236 --> 00:08:46,115
then went to meet with the plumber.
- Right, right. Okay, I'll leave you to it.

136
00:08:47,045 --> 00:08:48,444
Charlie, wait.

137
00:08:48,717 --> 00:08:51,231
This is your home. Sit down.
Drink your coffee.

138
00:08:52,522 --> 00:08:54,035
Okay.

139
00:09:22,921 --> 00:09:25,515
Oh, and I'm white trash.

140
00:09:46,170 --> 00:09:47,888
What are you, a farm animal?

141
00:09:48,804 --> 00:09:50,999
- What?
- That's your brother's ex-wife out there.

142
00:09:51,313 --> 00:09:53,065
I know who she is.

143
00:09:53,362 --> 00:09:56,672
Oh, no, no. She's just staying here
because of the earthquake.

144
00:09:57,042 --> 00:10:00,239
I'm not. I would never. I couldn't.

145
00:10:00,763 --> 00:10:03,152
Okay, I could. But I'm not.

146
00:10:04,275 --> 00:10:07,870
Yeah. That's what I used to stay
about my stepbrother, Cousin Dewey.

147
00:10:16,151 --> 00:10:18,426
How's it going?
Used to having your mom here?

148
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:20,548
Nope. You?

149
00:10:21,336 --> 00:10:23,645
I'm still thinking Mexico.

150
00:10:24,346 --> 00:10:26,382
I liked it better
when they weren't talking.

151
00:10:26,688 --> 00:10:29,043
Can't get away with much
when they compare notes.

152
00:10:29,657 --> 00:10:31,534
It's hell.

153
00:10:31,998 --> 00:10:33,829
Jake, your mom wants to say
goodbye.

154
00:10:34,465 --> 00:10:37,343
- She's leaving?
- Just for a little while.

155
00:10:41,281 --> 00:10:43,397
- Where's she going?
- Just out to dinner.

156
00:10:43,706 --> 00:10:46,698
You know, with a friend.
I guess it's a date of some sort.

157
00:10:47,888 --> 00:10:49,446
She's going on a date?

158
00:10:50,271 --> 00:10:51,943
Of some sort.

159
00:10:52,487 --> 00:10:54,443
- And you're okay with this?
- Oh, yeah.

160
00:10:54,745 --> 00:10:58,294
We talked about it. I think it's a sign
of maturity that our relationship...

161
00:10:58,676 --> 00:11:01,907
has evolved enough that we can be
honest that we see other people.

162
00:11:02,355 --> 00:11:05,472
Yeah, except the people you're seeing
are in magazines and videos.

163
00:11:06,788 --> 00:11:08,983
Hey, I told you
to stay out of my room.

164
00:11:10,802 --> 00:11:13,032
And that's not the point.
If I were dating...

165
00:11:13,353 --> 00:11:16,026
she'd be just as supportive
of me as I am of her.

166
00:11:16,363 --> 00:11:20,436
We're no longer ex-husband and ex-wife.
We are friends getting on with our lives.

167
00:11:20,837 --> 00:11:22,555
She's happy and I'm happy.

168
00:11:22,844 --> 00:11:25,438
- Okay. I'm leaving.
- Oh, have fun.

169
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:29,412
Wow, I'm impressed.

170
00:11:29,702 --> 00:11:33,456
What happened to my jealous,
tightly-wrapped, neurotic brother?

171
00:11:35,389 --> 00:11:37,584
Oh, there he is.

172
00:11:54,958 --> 00:11:57,153
Well, well, well.

173
00:11:58,136 --> 00:12:02,334
- Alan?
- Oh, you remember me?

174
00:12:02,735 --> 00:12:04,168
What are you doing up so late?

175
00:12:04,617 --> 00:12:07,085
That's funny, I was about
to ask you the same thing.

176
00:12:07,418 --> 00:12:09,295
Don't tell me you were
waiting up for me?

177
00:12:09,593 --> 00:12:11,663
This isn't about
what I was doing, Judith.

178
00:12:11,976 --> 00:12:13,295
No, no.

179
00:12:13,565 --> 00:12:16,318
This is about
what you were doing until...

180
00:12:18,248 --> 00:12:19,681
now.

181
00:12:19,921 --> 00:12:22,754
I told you I had a date.
You said you were fine with it.

182
00:12:23,601 --> 00:12:28,880
In theory, I was. In practice,
I think we can both see I'm not.

183
00:12:29,956 --> 00:12:32,424
What did you want me to do,
sit here and do nothing?

184
00:12:32,758 --> 00:12:35,431
Why not?
It was good enough for me.

185
00:12:35,769 --> 00:12:38,044
You know what,
you haven't changed at all.

186
00:12:38,361 --> 00:12:41,990
You're still the same neurotic,
overbearing, control freak I threw out.

187
00:12:42,375 --> 00:12:46,163
Neurotic? Maybe. Overbearing? Perhaps.
But you know what?

188
00:12:46,557 --> 00:12:49,025
You're not gonna throw me out,
because I have changed.

189
00:12:49,358 --> 00:12:52,509
Tonight, I'm leaving you.

190
00:13:01,108 --> 00:13:05,545
As it turns out,
a distinction without a difference.

191
00:13:09,053 --> 00:13:11,692
Fine, Alan. Suit yourself.

192
00:13:12,272 --> 00:13:13,830
Where's Dad?

193
00:13:14,238 --> 00:13:17,674
- He's at our house.
- How come?

194
00:13:18,043 --> 00:13:20,238
Well, we decided we needed
a little time apart.

195
00:13:20,761 --> 00:13:22,991
Isn't that why you got a divorce?

196
00:13:23,562 --> 00:13:24,915
It's hard to explain, Jake.

197
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:29,779
- Do I get any presents this time?
- No.

198
00:13:30,587 --> 00:13:32,418
What happens now?
You gonna live here?

199
00:13:32,845 --> 00:13:35,075
- No.
- Are you gonna buy a new house?

200
00:13:35,396 --> 00:13:36,954
No.

201
00:13:37,236 --> 00:13:40,034
Wanna go to Mexico
with me and Uncle Charlie?

202
00:13:41,292 --> 00:13:43,283
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

203
00:13:43,591 --> 00:13:44,910
Where's Alan?

204
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:47,853
- Well, it's a long story.
- You're not gonna believe it.

205
00:13:58,686 --> 00:14:01,723
Hi. I just stopped by
to say I told you so.

206
00:14:13,196 --> 00:14:15,664
I told you so.

207
00:14:16,457 --> 00:14:20,336
Oh, come on, Alan. If you can't
laugh at yourself, at least let me do it.

208
00:14:21,977 --> 00:14:23,535
What do you want, Charlie?

209
00:14:23,817 --> 00:14:25,296
Well...

210
00:14:29,252 --> 00:14:32,403
first of all, I'd like to know
exactly how you managed...

211
00:14:32,765 --> 00:14:35,154
to let your ex-wife
throw you out of my house.

212
00:14:37,114 --> 00:14:40,868
Because that's the first thing people
are gonna ask when I tell this story.

213
00:14:41,253 --> 00:14:43,721
She didn't throw me out, I left.

214
00:14:44,222 --> 00:14:49,091
Oh, good, there's a twist. You see,
that's what makes a good story.

215
00:14:49,532 --> 00:14:51,682
- Leave me alone, Charlie.
- Oh, lighten up.

216
00:14:51,999 --> 00:14:55,435
You tried to be friends with the woman
who wrecked your life and failed.

217
00:14:55,805 --> 00:14:58,399
No damage done.
Just a little personal humiliation...

218
00:14:58,732 --> 00:15:02,566
and at this point in your life,
how would you even notice that?

219
00:15:03,457 --> 00:15:06,767
- Are you finished?
- Did I mention I told you so?

220
00:15:07,136 --> 00:15:10,094
- Twice.
- Counting this one?

221
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:12,954
- Okay, I'm finished.
- Thank you.

222
00:15:13,283 --> 00:15:15,717
Now, on to new business.

223
00:15:16,043 --> 00:15:20,639
Currently, you and I are sitting in a
house that belongs to neither one of us.

224
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:24,814
While your ex-wife is sitting
in the house that belongs to me.

225
00:15:25,493 --> 00:15:28,803
- You see the paradox?
- I can't go back there, Charlie.

226
00:15:29,172 --> 00:15:32,403
She's running around, having
a great time, and I've got nothing.

227
00:15:32,768 --> 00:15:35,919
- You've got me.
- Drop dead.

228
00:15:36,615 --> 00:15:39,129
Okay, now you got nothing.

229
00:15:39,459 --> 00:15:42,212
It would be different
if Judith and I were both dating.

230
00:15:42,553 --> 00:15:44,430
True, but moot.

231
00:15:45,104 --> 00:15:47,823
- Unless...
- What unless?

232
00:15:48,156 --> 00:15:50,431
- It's stupid.
- Stupider than this?

233
00:15:50,748 --> 00:15:52,420
Come on. What do you got?

234
00:15:53,926 --> 00:15:56,645
Well, what if you were dating?

235
00:15:56,979 --> 00:15:59,891
- But I'm not.
- But if you looked like you were?

236
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:03,674
Oh, you mean? No, no way.

237
00:16:04,004 --> 00:16:07,121
I'm not gonna let you fix me up
with one of your bimbo girlfriends.

238
00:16:07,474 --> 00:16:09,226
Okay, forget it.

239
00:16:10,401 --> 00:16:12,710
She'd have to be really pretty.

240
00:16:13,035 --> 00:16:16,994
Like a 10. And young. Like a 20.

241
00:16:17,802 --> 00:16:20,157
- Anything else?
- And smart.

242
00:16:20,478 --> 00:16:23,993
And a sense of humor is important.
Well-read, good with kids...

243
00:16:24,367 --> 00:16:27,803
non-smoking, of course.
Oh, and easy on the piercings.

244
00:16:28,172 --> 00:16:30,288
Nothing south of the equator.

245
00:16:31,183 --> 00:16:35,415
You're mighty picky for a guy with
an adult newsstand in his sock drawer.

246
00:16:44,647 --> 00:16:48,083
Okay. Homework is taken care of.
He's taking a shower.

247
00:16:48,452 --> 00:16:51,569
You may wanna check in on him,
make sure he's not goofing around.

248
00:16:51,923 --> 00:16:54,278
- Where are you going?
- Oh, I have dinner plans.

249
00:16:54,933 --> 00:16:57,572
- Really?
- Yeah. Hard to believe, huh?

250
00:16:57,902 --> 00:17:01,497
- I didn't say that, I'm happy for you.
- Well, thank you.

251
00:17:01,875 --> 00:17:04,105
Again, I'm sorry I overreacted
the other night.

252
00:17:04,425 --> 00:17:08,418
I want us to have the kind of friendship
that can be mutually supportive.

253
00:17:08,816 --> 00:17:10,613
- Me too.
- You'll go out, I'll go out.

254
00:17:10,906 --> 00:17:14,103
Right. So is this someone
you've been seeing for a while?

255
00:17:19,562 --> 00:17:23,111
Yeah, a while.
But, you know, not exclusive.

256
00:17:23,493 --> 00:17:24,892
I don't wanna get tied down.

257
00:17:26,127 --> 00:17:27,526
Oh, that must be Camille.

258
00:17:32,357 --> 00:17:35,030
- She picks you up?
- Well, what can I say?

259
00:17:35,368 --> 00:17:37,404
It's a new world, Judith.

260
00:17:43,647 --> 00:17:46,286
Hey, wow.

261
00:17:49,459 --> 00:17:52,496
You are so good for my ego.

262
00:17:52,846 --> 00:17:54,518
- Hi, Charlie.
- Hi, Camille.

263
00:17:54,811 --> 00:17:58,281
- Hello, I'm Judith.
- You're Alan's ex?

264
00:17:58,658 --> 00:18:02,970
Wow, I didn't expect
you to be so young looking.

265
00:18:06,687 --> 00:18:09,918
- Thank you.
- I mean, you have such beautiful skin...

266
00:18:10,283 --> 00:18:12,843
for the mother of an 11 -year-old.

267
00:18:15,259 --> 00:18:16,851
Oh, thank you.

268
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:18,778
Okay. Well, we should get going.

269
00:18:19,064 --> 00:18:21,180
It was nice meeting you.

270
00:18:22,074 --> 00:18:25,271
I just hope I look half as good as her
when I'm that old.

271
00:18:28,096 --> 00:18:29,734
I'm betting you will.

272
00:18:32,235 --> 00:18:33,793
Man, I don't know how he does it.

273
00:18:34,075 --> 00:18:36,145
I made a big play for her, nothing.

274
00:18:36,458 --> 00:18:39,973
- She's so young.
- Yeah, some guys like that.

275
00:18:42,354 --> 00:18:43,833
I gotta hand it to you, Judith.

276
00:18:44,110 --> 00:18:45,543
You were very mature.

277
00:18:45,783 --> 00:18:48,900
I guess that's because
you're a very mature woman.

278
00:18:50,215 --> 00:18:52,570
Yeah, thanks.
Jake, say goodbye to Mommy!

279
00:18:52,891 --> 00:18:55,041
She's going home!

280
00:19:05,352 --> 00:19:07,786
- Good morning, everybody.
- Good morning.

281
00:19:08,112 --> 00:19:11,627
Sounds like somebody cracked open
the sock drawer last night.

282
00:19:13,297 --> 00:19:17,290
I'm going to ignore that because I am
in such a good mood. Charlie, thank you.

283
00:19:17,687 --> 00:19:22,124
Your ex-wife breaking the sound barrier
on her way out was thanks enough.

284
00:19:22,789 --> 00:19:26,225
I don't even care about that anymore.
That was the best date of my life.

285
00:19:26,594 --> 00:19:29,825
I mean, Camille is smart and funny.
And, oh, boy, talk about pretty.

286
00:19:30,190 --> 00:19:33,182
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I bet she
rocked your world in the sack, huh?

287
00:19:33,535 --> 00:19:37,528
What? No, no. Get your mind out
of the gutter. We just talked all night...

288
00:19:37,925 --> 00:19:41,361
and then there was a little kissing.
Maybe on our next date, who knows?

289
00:19:41,730 --> 00:19:43,800
But for now,
I'm just gonna play it slow.

290
00:19:44,114 --> 00:19:47,026
- You're playing it slow?
- Yeah.

291
00:19:47,375 --> 00:19:50,492
I don't know where you found Camille,
but she's a bit old-fashioned.

292
00:19:51,013 --> 00:19:53,322
She's not like the ones
you usually go out with.

293
00:19:53,648 --> 00:19:55,400
No, I guess not.

294
00:19:58,373 --> 00:20:01,888
A thousand dollars a night
and he's playing it slow.

295
00:20:03,348 --> 00:20:06,067
You're a good brother, Charlie.

296
00:20:07,739 --> 00:20:09,934
He's playing it slow.

297
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:14,769
She demanded cash.

298
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:17,812
He's playing it slow.
