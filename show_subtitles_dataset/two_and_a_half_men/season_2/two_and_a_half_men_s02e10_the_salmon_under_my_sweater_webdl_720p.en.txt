1
00:00:02,830 --> 00:00:06,220
- What you doing?
- I'm working.

2
00:00:06,888 --> 00:00:09,038
You're not gonna get much done
with the TV on.

3
00:00:09,356 --> 00:00:12,985
- What are you, my mother?
- Your mother says that too?

4
00:00:14,459 --> 00:00:16,450
Listen, when you write music
for a living...

5
00:00:16,718 --> 00:00:18,356
you have to wait for inspiration.

6
00:00:21,988 --> 00:00:23,785
Nope, not yet.

7
00:00:24,707 --> 00:00:26,618
Charlie, wanna come
to the movies with us?

8
00:00:26,882 --> 00:00:29,077
He can't. He's working.

9
00:00:29,852 --> 00:00:32,969
- On what, liver failure?
- Wonderful.

10
00:00:33,282 --> 00:00:35,318
He's my mother, you're my doctor.

11
00:00:36,001 --> 00:00:39,391
Oh, I assume you finished reading
Lord of the Flies for your book report.

12
00:00:39,724 --> 00:00:41,157
Oh, good. How'd you like it?

13
00:00:41,941 --> 00:00:45,616
I thought it was
a timeless American classic.

14
00:00:46,668 --> 00:00:50,104
I see. So tell me, what's it about?

15
00:00:50,642 --> 00:00:54,555
- You mean the book?
- Yeah, the book.

16
00:00:56,247 --> 00:00:57,919
It's called Lord of the Flies...

17
00:00:58,841 --> 00:01:02,914
and it's about a really big fly...

18
00:01:03,275 --> 00:01:06,233
that all the other flies pray to.

19
00:01:08,211 --> 00:01:13,001
- And you thought he didn't read it.
- Oh, I was just joking.

20
00:01:15,698 --> 00:01:19,896
It's more like Charlotte's Web,
but from the fly's point of view.

21
00:01:21,931 --> 00:01:24,570
You've had more than a week.
Why didn't you read the book?

22
00:01:26,365 --> 00:01:31,280
- I've been waiting for inspiration.
- Attaboy.

23
00:01:31,719 --> 00:01:35,029
Okay, how's this for inspiration?
We're not going to the movies...

24
00:01:35,359 --> 00:01:38,476
and you're not doing anything
until you finish reading that book.

25
00:01:39,625 --> 00:01:42,059
- That's not fair.
- Course it's fair. We had a deal.

26
00:01:42,344 --> 00:01:46,053
- You didn't keep your end of it.
- Oh, so now two wrongs make a right?

27
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:49,458
Bet you didn't see that one coming.

28
00:01:50,878 --> 00:01:53,631
You're really gonna like this book
if you give it a chance.

29
00:01:53,931 --> 00:01:56,445
It's about kids
stranded on a deserted island.

30
00:01:56,776 --> 00:01:59,290
- How'd they get stranded?
- Their plane crashes.

31
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:01,417
Oh, really. And then what happens?

32
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:05,583
This one kid named Ralph becomes their
leader, and they form this society, and...

33
00:02:06,229 --> 00:02:08,265
Just read the book.

34
00:02:10,831 --> 00:02:16,428
- One big fly, huh?
- Hey, I took a shot.

35
00:02:32,331 --> 00:02:33,844
Hi.

36
00:02:35,594 --> 00:02:38,506
- Charlie's working, Rose.
- Oh, what about Jake?

37
00:02:39,735 --> 00:02:41,487
He's studying.

38
00:02:42,413 --> 00:02:45,928
- Hey, do you like smoked salmon?
- I guess.

39
00:02:46,303 --> 00:02:48,419
Good. Then this is for you.

40
00:02:53,121 --> 00:02:57,319
- I don't know what to say.
- Neither do I, most of the time.

41
00:02:57,681 --> 00:03:00,514
But then I start talking,
and stuff just comes out.

42
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:05,498
So, what are you doing
this fine Saturday night?

43
00:03:06,130 --> 00:03:08,166
I was supposed go to the movies
with Jake...

44
00:03:08,431 --> 00:03:10,422
but he didn't
do his homework, so...

45
00:03:10,732 --> 00:03:14,566
So you're punishing him by sitting out
here all by yourself, alone and miserable.

46
00:03:14,915 --> 00:03:16,906
What a good dad.

47
00:03:18,554 --> 00:03:20,988
If you still wanna go to the movies,
I'll go with you.

48
00:03:21,691 --> 00:03:26,719
- You and me? Like a...? Like a date?
- Alan, are you asking me out?

49
00:03:27,631 --> 00:03:31,146
- I don't think so.
- Okay.

50
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:36,552
That was a little awkward.
Come on, we'll catch an early show.

51
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:39,837
Oh, all right. All right, why not.

52
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:42,455
I'll sneak in the salmon
under my sweater.

53
00:03:43,025 --> 00:03:47,496
Good. That way, we don't have to pay
for that overpriced movie fish.

54
00:03:49,634 --> 00:03:52,023
- Hey. What you doing?
- Working.

55
00:03:53,859 --> 00:03:56,054
How do you know
when you're on a break?

56
00:03:56,327 --> 00:03:59,956
That's the thing about being a grownup,
my little friend: You don't get breaks.

57
00:04:04,902 --> 00:04:06,972
Is this the new
Oshikuru: Demon SamuraÃ¯?

58
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:09,707
- Yeah.
- What are you doing with it?

59
00:04:09,963 --> 00:04:13,751
It's being turned into a cartoon, and they
asked me to write the theme song.

60
00:04:14,105 --> 00:04:16,096
- Awesome.
- Yeah?

61
00:04:16,363 --> 00:04:18,831
- Wanna hear what I got so far?
- Sure.

62
00:04:19,124 --> 00:04:21,797
So I'll be, like, the first kid in the world
to hear this.

63
00:04:22,178 --> 00:04:23,736
Yep.

64
00:04:24,186 --> 00:04:27,576
Now, this is just a rough version,
but you get an idea of the feel of it.

65
00:04:27,909 --> 00:04:29,342
Okay.

66
00:04:30,795 --> 00:04:37,314
Oh, oh, oh, oh, Oshikuru
Oh, oh, oh, oh, Oshikuru

67
00:04:37,781 --> 00:04:42,297
My, oh, my
He's a demon samurai

68
00:04:42,884 --> 00:04:46,194
Who 's the guy who had to die?
Oshikuru

69
00:04:46,858 --> 00:04:50,453
Boy. That really blows.

70
00:04:52,337 --> 00:04:53,611
Excuse me?

71
00:04:54,136 --> 00:04:58,209
- Did you even read the comic?
- Yeah, I looked it over.

72
00:04:58,779 --> 00:05:00,610
Oh, really? What's it about?

73
00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:05,928
It's about this guy named Oshikuru,
who dies...

74
00:05:06,225 --> 00:05:10,013
and comes back as a,
what do you call it, samurai.

75
00:05:10,450 --> 00:05:13,089
- And he's a demon.
- No.

76
00:05:13,378 --> 00:05:16,370
It's about a teenage boy
in a futuristic society...

77
00:05:16,683 --> 00:05:20,039
who's possessed by the tortured soul
of a feudal Japanese warrior...

78
00:05:20,364 --> 00:05:23,515
condemned to walk the earth
fighting the evil he once embodied.

79
00:05:24,212 --> 00:05:26,009
So, what's your point?

80
00:05:26,262 --> 00:05:29,572
He lives in a dark world.
He battles the spirits of the damned.

81
00:05:29,901 --> 00:05:33,098
Your theme doesn't
capture the mood at all. It just blows.

82
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:38,660
- Okay, okay, you said "blows" already.
- Did I say "big baby chunks"?

83
00:05:40,108 --> 00:05:42,258
All right, fine. Thanks for your input.

84
00:05:43,036 --> 00:05:45,869
Why don't you go read Lord of the Flies,
and let me do my job.

85
00:05:46,173 --> 00:05:49,927
Well, if your job is ruining a great
comic book, you can call it a night.

86
00:05:50,314 --> 00:05:52,669
- I heard that.
- Good.

87
00:05:56,463 --> 00:06:00,934
Oh, no. What do you wanna bet
Shrek here sits right in front of us.

88
00:06:01,316 --> 00:06:02,874
Don't worry. It'll be all right.

89
00:06:07,088 --> 00:06:09,886
You had to eat the chili cheeseburger.

90
00:06:14,199 --> 00:06:18,033
- That wasn't really necessary.
- You'd have done the same thing for me.

91
00:06:18,759 --> 00:06:20,750
I'm not so sure.

92
00:06:21,311 --> 00:06:25,224
- So, Alan, tell me about yourself.
- What would you like to know?

93
00:06:25,786 --> 00:06:28,220
Everything. I really don't know
that much about you...

94
00:06:28,505 --> 00:06:31,861
aside from the fact that you're
Charlie's brother and Jake's dad.

95
00:06:32,186 --> 00:06:35,622
Graduated from Cal State Long Beach,
married your college sweetheart...

96
00:06:35,951 --> 00:06:39,830
and in the middle of the night, when
you're half-asleep, you pee sitting down.

97
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:43,518
- Have you been spying on me?
- No, silly.

98
00:06:43,815 --> 00:06:47,603
I spy on Charlie.
You just get in the way sometimes.

99
00:06:48,207 --> 00:06:50,960
You know what?
Why don't you tell me about you.

100
00:06:51,261 --> 00:06:54,014
Well, okay. Well, let's see.

101
00:06:54,315 --> 00:06:58,149
I, too, pee sitting down,
so we have that in common.

102
00:06:58,707 --> 00:07:02,143
I come from a wealthy family, so I guess
I've had kind of a sheltered life.

103
00:07:02,472 --> 00:07:04,827
You know, fancy private schools
and colleges.

104
00:07:05,107 --> 00:07:06,984
- No kidding.
- What college did you go to?

105
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,912
Princeton. But just for two years.

106
00:07:09,541 --> 00:07:12,897
- Oh, so you dropped out?
- No, I finished.

107
00:07:14,226 --> 00:07:17,184
Then I came back to California
to do my master's at Stanford.

108
00:07:17,530 --> 00:07:19,805
That's amazing.
What's your degree in?

109
00:07:24,976 --> 00:07:26,375
Behavioral psychology.

110
00:07:32,799 --> 00:07:35,472
Hey, Jake. Jake, wake up.
I want you to hear something.

111
00:07:35,810 --> 00:07:37,960
- What?
- I've been working on the song.

112
00:07:38,278 --> 00:07:41,714
- Good for you.
- Come on. Come listen to it.

113
00:07:42,043 --> 00:07:45,718
- I'm sleeping.
- Sleep in school, like everybody else.

114
00:07:48,861 --> 00:07:50,738
I read the comic books cover to cover.

115
00:07:50,995 --> 00:07:53,793
I know the characters,
I know their world.

116
00:07:54,090 --> 00:07:57,287
I think I got it. Listen.

117
00:07:59,068 --> 00:08:04,301
A teenage boy with the spirit inside
Of a samurai warrior who long ago died

118
00:08:04,882 --> 00:08:08,795
Now he's oh, oh, oh, Oshikuru

119
00:08:09,149 --> 00:08:12,221
Oh, oh, oh, Oshikuru

120
00:08:12,537 --> 00:08:17,372
My, oh, my
He's a demon samurai

121
00:08:17,766 --> 00:08:21,441
Who 's the guy who had to die?
Oshikuru

122
00:08:23,581 --> 00:08:25,537
Still blows.

123
00:08:27,596 --> 00:08:30,827
Yeah, well, you're still short.

124
00:08:33,369 --> 00:08:34,882
- Hey.
- Hey.

125
00:08:35,126 --> 00:08:37,924
Sorry I'm late. We stopped
for a bite to eat after the movie.

126
00:08:38,388 --> 00:08:42,427
- No problem.
- An usher confiscated our fish.

127
00:08:44,454 --> 00:08:46,729
- Hey, can I play you something?
- Sure.

128
00:08:47,005 --> 00:08:49,075
You know, I had a really good time
with Rose.

129
00:08:49,348 --> 00:08:51,498
There's a lot more there
than meets the eye.

130
00:08:51,983 --> 00:08:54,577
Yeah. Cool. Listen to this.
Tell me what you think.

131
00:08:57,505 --> 00:09:02,784
A teenage boy with the spirit inside
Of a samurai warrior who long ago died

132
00:09:03,194 --> 00:09:07,028
Now he's oh, oh, oh, Oshikuru

133
00:09:07,377 --> 00:09:10,369
Oh, oh, oh, Oshikuru

134
00:09:10,681 --> 00:09:15,755
My, oh, my
He's a demon samurai

135
00:09:16,161 --> 00:09:19,597
Who 's the guy who had to die?
Oshikuru

136
00:09:20,135 --> 00:09:22,603
Very nice. It's snappy.

137
00:09:22,896 --> 00:09:25,126
- You really like it?
- Yeah, yeah. Good work.

138
00:09:28,417 --> 00:09:32,808
Okay, that settles it. It blows.

139
00:09:36,156 --> 00:09:39,865
Berta, you know what's a good book?
Lord of the Flies.

140
00:09:40,214 --> 00:09:43,012
Oh, yeah. I read that
when I was about your age.

141
00:09:43,351 --> 00:09:45,819
- So, what'd you think?
- I liked it.

142
00:09:46,112 --> 00:09:52,301
- It was like Survivor with kids.
- Yeah. I agree.

143
00:09:55,565 --> 00:09:59,797
- Is Survivor spelled like it sounds?
- Just read the damn book.

144
00:10:01,547 --> 00:10:02,980
- Morning, Berta.
- Morning.

145
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:07,213
Hey, did you know that Rose
has a master's degree in psychology?

146
00:10:07,571 --> 00:10:10,722
No. Did you know I'm a
founding member of the Mile High Club?

147
00:10:11,837 --> 00:10:14,829
- Really?
- Yeah. Me and Orville at Kitty Hawk.

148
00:10:15,142 --> 00:10:18,339
I'd have done Wilbur too, but we were
only in the air for 90 seconds.

149
00:10:19,911 --> 00:10:22,869
Okay, you're kidding, and it's funny.

150
00:10:23,173 --> 00:10:25,812
But the truth is, you and I
see each other every day...

151
00:10:26,101 --> 00:10:28,012
and we don't know
much about each other.

152
00:10:28,486 --> 00:10:31,603
So you wanna know what goes on
underneath this gruff exterior.

153
00:10:31,916 --> 00:10:34,555
Whether somewhere inside me,
there's a tiny little girl...

154
00:10:34,844 --> 00:10:37,039
who once dreamed of being
a famous ballerina.

155
00:10:37,312 --> 00:10:38,904
- Is there?
- Lf there is...

156
00:10:39,153 --> 00:10:42,384
it's because I accidentally ate one
and haven't passed her yet.

157
00:10:43,043 --> 00:10:46,399
Let me tell you,
I am dreading that tiara.

158
00:10:47,644 --> 00:10:52,354
- Okay. Well, it was nice talking to you.
- Hey, I feel closer.

159
00:10:54,923 --> 00:10:57,118
Oh, are you starting
that book report already?

160
00:10:57,683 --> 00:11:00,675
- Just making notes.
- Good for you. What do you have so far?

161
00:11:01,239 --> 00:11:04,356
Lord of the Flies is kind of like Survivor,
but with kids.

162
00:11:05,631 --> 00:11:08,304
That's an interesting analogy.
What's your favorite part?

163
00:11:11,278 --> 00:11:14,190
When the first kid
gets voted off the island?

164
00:11:20,188 --> 00:11:22,383
Hey, all right.

165
00:11:23,074 --> 00:11:26,305
Stop trying to be friends with Berta.
It just pisses her off.

166
00:11:27,006 --> 00:11:28,519
What doesn't?

167
00:11:28,805 --> 00:11:32,081
Hey, I was gonna do some shopping,
and was hoping you could watch Jake.

168
00:11:32,444 --> 00:11:35,004
- Sure.
- Ready when you are, Alan.

169
00:11:35,289 --> 00:11:38,440
- Be right there. I'll see you later.
- No, wait, wait, wait. Hold on.

170
00:11:38,761 --> 00:11:42,037
- You're going out with Rose again?
- No, I'm not "going out" with her.

171
00:11:42,358 --> 00:11:45,475
- We're just going shopping.
- Morning, Charlie.

172
00:11:46,206 --> 00:11:49,004
You haven't forgotten
that she's a little bent, right?

173
00:11:50,097 --> 00:11:52,327
No, I think there's a lot more to her
than that.

174
00:11:52,607 --> 00:11:56,998
- Deep down, there's a good person.
- Deep down, there's a few good people.

175
00:11:57,375 --> 00:12:00,014
And all of them are bent.

176
00:12:00,889 --> 00:12:03,084
- He'll be right with you, Rose.
- Okay.

177
00:12:03,357 --> 00:12:05,951
- Charlie, everybody has flaws.
- Flaws?

178
00:12:06,243 --> 00:12:09,599
She Superglued my testicles
to my thigh.

179
00:12:11,137 --> 00:12:13,810
That was the past.
We've all done things we're ashamed of.

180
00:12:14,107 --> 00:12:18,100
She's not ashamed. She took a picture,
then used it for her Christmas card.

181
00:12:19,754 --> 00:12:23,872
Thank God it was an extreme close-up.
Most people thought it was a fruit bat.

182
00:12:25,945 --> 00:12:27,822
Okay, well,
I appreciate your concern...

183
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:30,798
but I think Rose is a sweet,
smart, interesting woman.

184
00:12:31,090 --> 00:12:33,479
I enjoy spending time with her.
Meet me out front.

185
00:12:33,935 --> 00:12:35,368
Okey-dokey.

186
00:12:40,084 --> 00:12:43,156
- Hey, what're you doing?
- Reading Lord of the Flies.

187
00:12:43,472 --> 00:12:45,383
Not important.

188
00:12:46,944 --> 00:12:49,902
- Now, listen. You're a kid, right?
- Yeah.

189
00:12:50,207 --> 00:12:51,799
Okay. I'm writing a song for kids.

190
00:12:52,047 --> 00:12:54,436
So assuming that
what I've done already blows...

191
00:12:54,725 --> 00:12:56,681
- It does.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

192
00:12:56,942 --> 00:12:59,410
Assuming that, you need to help me
make it better.

193
00:12:59,702 --> 00:13:02,170
- But I have to do a book report.
- Okay.

194
00:13:02,463 --> 00:13:05,296
I'll help you with the book report.
You help me with the song.

195
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:08,797
- Quid pro quo.
- No.

196
00:13:09,114 --> 00:13:12,902
"Oshikuru."

197
00:13:16,518 --> 00:13:19,635
Here you go. Raspberry-mango-banana
with a shot of wheatgrass.

198
00:13:20,241 --> 00:13:21,959
- Thank you.
- My pleasure.

199
00:13:24,131 --> 00:13:26,804
You know, sometimes
I like to come to the mall...

200
00:13:27,101 --> 00:13:30,138
and just watch people and make up
stories about who they are...

201
00:13:30,448 --> 00:13:33,758
and what their lives are like.
- Oh, well, that's fun.

202
00:13:34,087 --> 00:13:37,875
What about that lady over there?
What do you think her life is like?

203
00:13:38,228 --> 00:13:42,744
Well, I'd say she's a smart woman,
but very Ionely.

204
00:13:43,122 --> 00:13:46,751
So used to rejection, it's become
like the air she breathes...

205
00:13:47,096 --> 00:13:51,135
which is all the more sad
because she's got so much to give.

206
00:13:51,488 --> 00:13:56,926
Emotionally, spiritually, sexually.
Especially sexually.

207
00:13:57,344 --> 00:14:01,895
She is ripe, smoldering
and willing to try anything.

208
00:14:10,856 --> 00:14:15,327
- What about that lady over there?
- Her?

209
00:14:15,959 --> 00:14:19,554
Well, let's see.
She's a little tougher to read.

210
00:14:19,933 --> 00:14:25,132
I'd say she's a smart woman,
very Ionely.

211
00:14:25,538 --> 00:14:29,736
So used to rejection, it's become
like the air she breathes...

212
00:14:31,143 --> 00:14:32,622
which is all the more sad...

213
00:14:32,858 --> 00:14:36,771
See, even though Oshikuru is for kids,
it's not really a kids' comic.

214
00:14:37,125 --> 00:14:40,754
- It's very mature.
- Okay, I think I got it.

215
00:14:41,099 --> 00:14:43,932
The demons Oshikuru fights
only exist...

216
00:14:44,236 --> 00:14:48,548
because they are a reflection
of the tortured demons in his own soul.

217
00:14:49,172 --> 00:14:51,766
- Yes.
- So, in essence...

218
00:14:52,058 --> 00:14:56,210
Oshikuru is like a Japanese
sci-fi version of Moby Dick.

219
00:14:59,964 --> 00:15:03,320
- What?
- You said, "Moby Dick."

220
00:15:05,695 --> 00:15:08,289
I mean, sure, being single
can be Ionely sometimes...

221
00:15:08,581 --> 00:15:12,733
but it's better than being together
with someone you don't love or respect.

222
00:15:13,099 --> 00:15:17,968
- Is that what your marriage was like?
- Well, according to my ex-wife, it was.

223
00:15:19,332 --> 00:15:20,924
Hey, as long as we're done here...

224
00:15:21,172 --> 00:15:24,084
why don't we take a drive
down to the beach and take a walk.

225
00:15:24,435 --> 00:15:26,903
- Alan, are you flirting with me?
- Oh, no, no.

226
00:15:27,196 --> 00:15:29,630
I just thought, you know,
since it's a beautiful day...

227
00:15:29,915 --> 00:15:31,712
If you are, it's okay.

228
00:15:33,303 --> 00:15:35,612
- Really?
- Yeah.

229
00:15:35,897 --> 00:15:39,173
There's a lot more to you
than I thought.

230
00:15:40,163 --> 00:15:45,078
- What did you think?
- Oh, let's not spoil the moment.

231
00:15:47,609 --> 00:15:51,079
Okay. So, what do we do now?

232
00:15:51,541 --> 00:15:56,820
- Wanna try kissing?
- Yes, I think we should.

233
00:16:05,763 --> 00:16:08,641
- Okay.
- Yeah.

234
00:16:08,943 --> 00:16:12,492
- Wanna get a room?
- Excuse me?

235
00:16:13,293 --> 00:16:16,763
Or we can go back to my place,
unless you're afraid of ferrets.

236
00:16:18,522 --> 00:16:20,877
- Ferrets?
- Yeah.

237
00:16:21,157 --> 00:16:24,229
I have five of the toothy little guys.

238
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:29,775
No kidding. Five ferrets.

239
00:16:30,109 --> 00:16:35,308
- Those are like long, furry rats, right?
- Yep.

240
00:16:35,714 --> 00:16:38,069
And they're all named Charlie.

241
00:16:39,688 --> 00:16:42,361
Of course they are.

242
00:16:42,658 --> 00:16:46,128
Well, as much as I would
love to meet...

243
00:16:46,464 --> 00:16:49,501
Charlie and Charlie
and Charlie and Charlie...

244
00:16:49,811 --> 00:16:52,279
- And Charlie.
- Right.

245
00:16:52,572 --> 00:16:57,202
I can't help but wonder, is it worth
putting our friendship at risk?

246
00:16:58,051 --> 00:17:01,839
Well, that's a good question.
Let's think about it for a minute.

247
00:17:04,493 --> 00:17:07,644
How good are you in bed?
Because I'm excellent.

248
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:14,055
Truthfully, I'm more of
an advanced intermediate.

249
00:17:15,620 --> 00:17:18,771
- Then let's stay friends.
- Yeah, good idea.

250
00:17:19,887 --> 00:17:22,560
- Can I ask you a question?
- Sure.

251
00:17:22,857 --> 00:17:26,566
What, specifically, turned you off
to the idea of a physical liaison?

252
00:17:27,123 --> 00:17:31,435
Was it the psychosexual fraternal rivalry,
symbolized by the Charlie surrogates?

253
00:17:31,808 --> 00:17:33,844
Or the prospect
of being judged inadequate...

254
00:17:34,109 --> 00:17:37,067
by a woman who professes to have
superior sexual skills?

255
00:17:37,455 --> 00:17:40,845
Wait a minute. Have you been doing
that behavioral psychology thing on me?

256
00:17:41,178 --> 00:17:43,214
No, don't be silly.

257
00:17:43,479 --> 00:17:49,156
But if I said yes, would that
make you feel A, angry, or B, insecure?

258
00:19:11,448 --> 00:19:13,757
I thought you were gonna
write the report for me.

259
00:19:14,042 --> 00:19:16,272
No, Jake. That would be wrong.

260
00:19:16,551 --> 00:19:18,985
The only way to learn
is to do the work yourself.

261
00:19:19,898 --> 00:19:23,686
Now, these are called Cliff Notes.

262
00:19:25,712 --> 00:19:28,545
Inside is everything you need to know
about Lord of the Flies.

263
00:19:28,850 --> 00:19:30,841
The themes, the characters,
the symbolism.

264
00:19:31,108 --> 00:19:33,941
It's a book report waiting for you
to put your name on it.

265
00:19:37,006 --> 00:19:38,280
Is that legal?

266
00:19:38,512 --> 00:19:40,707
Look around.
Do you see any homework police?

267
00:19:44,829 --> 00:19:48,458
Oh, man. I give you
way too much credit.

268
00:19:52,944 --> 00:19:56,061
Oh, I meant to ask you,
how'd that book report turn out?

269
00:19:56,374 --> 00:19:59,286
- I got a D-minus.
- D-minus?

270
00:19:59,804 --> 00:20:03,638
- Didn't you read the Cliff Notes?
- That was 50 pages.

271
00:20:05,075 --> 00:20:07,908
Unbelievable. Your kid's too lazy
to cheat.

272
00:20:08,254 --> 00:20:11,087
Has it occurred to you that maybe
he's too honest to cheat?

273
00:20:11,851 --> 00:20:13,842
No, I'm lazy.

274
00:20:14,486 --> 00:20:17,876
- Oshikuru: Demon Samurai.
- Hey, it's on.

275
00:20:19,046 --> 00:20:25,519
Oh, oh, oh, Oshikuru
Oh, oh, oh, Oshikuru

276
00:20:25,990 --> 00:20:30,825
My, oh, my
He's a demon samurai

277
00:20:31,219 --> 00:20:34,848
Who 's the guy who had to die?
Oshikuru

278
00:20:35,192 --> 00:20:38,662
That's not what we wrote.
That's your original, sucky version.

279
00:20:39,292 --> 00:20:41,806
What can I tell you?
The network liked that one better.

280
00:20:42,094 --> 00:20:47,214
- What, are they brain-damaged?
- Welcome to show business, kid.

281
00:20:49,666 --> 00:20:51,896
I still think it's snappy.

282
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:57,090
Oshikuru
