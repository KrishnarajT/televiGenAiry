1
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:15,999
Tequila, checkbook, sourpuss.

2
00:00:17,096 --> 00:00:19,291
Must be alimony time.

3
00:00:19,855 --> 00:00:21,846
Go away, Charlie.

4
00:00:22,364 --> 00:00:26,152
Boy, you'd think for all that money, she'd
at least come and give you a lap dance.

5
00:00:26,713 --> 00:00:29,989
- Leave me alone, Charlie.
- In fact, you know what'd be funny?

6
00:00:30,308 --> 00:00:32,868
Where it says "memo,"
write "lap dance."

7
00:00:33,653 --> 00:00:36,326
Give her something to explain
at tax time.

8
00:00:37,709 --> 00:00:39,188
Charlie, you...

9
00:00:40,218 --> 00:00:41,810
Okay.

10
00:00:42,476 --> 00:00:44,512
- So where's Jake?
- Sleeping at a friend's.

11
00:00:44,776 --> 00:00:46,767
- He'll get dropped off tomorrow.
- Oh, man.

12
00:00:47,034 --> 00:00:49,423
- I rented a movie he'd like.
- Oh, what'd you get?

13
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:51,701
Don't worry. It's educational.

14
00:00:52,009 --> 00:00:54,762
One Million Years B. C.?
How is this educational?

15
00:00:55,271 --> 00:00:59,184
Raquel Welch running from dinosaurs
in a fur bikini?

16
00:00:59,912 --> 00:01:01,982
What is that if not history?

17
00:01:02,839 --> 00:01:05,672
I'm afraid you're gonna have to
watch it by yourself.

18
00:01:05,975 --> 00:01:07,886
Won't be the first time.

19
00:01:09,696 --> 00:01:11,414
What's the deal with that giraffe?

20
00:01:11,661 --> 00:01:14,653
How come you bring it out every time
you write an alimony check?

21
00:01:15,132 --> 00:01:16,770
It's symbolic.

22
00:01:18,393 --> 00:01:20,190
Do you wanna know
what it's symbolic of?

23
00:01:20,442 --> 00:01:22,160
No, I'm good.

24
00:01:23,870 --> 00:01:26,907
I made it in ceramics class for Judith
when we were dating.

25
00:01:28,930 --> 00:01:32,969
All these years I've been shelling out
for tennis bracelets and satin underwear.

26
00:01:33,738 --> 00:01:36,298
Some women aren't impressed
with jewelry and lingerie.

27
00:01:36,874 --> 00:01:39,104
Well, sure, if you wanna
date a dead girl.

28
00:01:41,892 --> 00:01:43,689
Hey, I just realized.

29
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:47,899
Your name is Al, and you're sending
your ex-wife money...

30
00:01:48,247 --> 00:01:52,604
so it's "Al-I-money."

31
00:01:54,519 --> 00:01:58,273
Hey, hey, I just realized,
your name is Charlie...

32
00:01:58,617 --> 00:02:00,494
and you're a moron.

33
00:02:05,307 --> 00:02:07,343
Be that as it may.

34
00:02:07,648 --> 00:02:09,843
If you gave her the giraffe,
why do you have it?

35
00:02:10,324 --> 00:02:12,838
When Judith kicked me out,
I wanted to get back at her.

36
00:02:13,126 --> 00:02:15,720
She took the house, she took the car,
she took the money.

37
00:02:16,011 --> 00:02:20,004
- I felt I had to take something.
- So you stole bric-a-brac.

38
00:02:21,655 --> 00:02:24,692
- Symbolic bric-a-brac.
- Oh, right.

39
00:02:25,377 --> 00:02:28,016
You see, now every month
when I write the check...

40
00:02:28,304 --> 00:02:31,660
I can look at it and remind myself...

41
00:02:32,234 --> 00:02:35,271
what a pathetic loser I am.

42
00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:41,008
No, dude. You don't need
a giraffe for that.

43
00:02:42,729 --> 00:02:44,082
Get rid of the damn thing.

44
00:02:44,318 --> 00:02:46,354
You're killing yourself
with this bitterness.

45
00:02:46,785 --> 00:02:49,743
What, you think I'm hurting myself
more than her?

46
00:02:50,088 --> 00:02:52,443
No, I don't think
you're hurting her at all.

47
00:02:53,433 --> 00:02:55,025
You need to move on, buddy.

48
00:02:57,363 --> 00:03:00,002
You're right. You're right.

49
00:03:00,290 --> 00:03:02,963
And you know what would
be truly symbolic of that?

50
00:03:03,259 --> 00:03:06,854
Getting your knob shined
by a keno waitress in Laughlin?

51
00:03:08,067 --> 00:03:10,581
No. No.

52
00:03:11,663 --> 00:03:16,134
Me bringing this back to Judith
and apologizing for taking it.

53
00:03:18,771 --> 00:03:20,841
I like my idea better.

54
00:03:21,406 --> 00:03:23,203
Okay, here's the plan.

55
00:03:23,454 --> 00:03:26,526
I'll bring this little fella back to Judith,
and clean the slate.

56
00:03:27,301 --> 00:03:29,098
Did you even consider my idea?

57
00:03:30,144 --> 00:03:32,021
- You drive.
- Why do I have to go?

58
00:03:32,277 --> 00:03:35,189
Because I am obviously
too drunk to drive.

59
00:03:35,747 --> 00:03:38,261
What does that say about your plan?

60
00:03:48,166 --> 00:03:49,440
Alan, wait.

61
00:03:49,671 --> 00:03:52,185
You can't stop me.
I am giving Judith back the giraffe.

62
00:03:52,472 --> 00:03:55,225
Oh, I don't wanna stop you.
I just want a good view.

63
00:03:56,528 --> 00:03:58,598
Okay, you can stay.

64
00:04:00,166 --> 00:04:03,795
Charlie, look at this. What is this?
"The Harpers."

65
00:04:04,598 --> 00:04:06,987
- Yeah, so?
- She's not the Harpers anymore.

66
00:04:07,274 --> 00:04:09,310
She's the Harper.

67
00:04:11,204 --> 00:04:12,717
That mat is a complete lie.

68
00:04:13,169 --> 00:04:15,729
Yeah, and it's in cahoots
with the mailbox.

69
00:04:18,772 --> 00:04:21,002
Come on, ring the bell.

70
00:04:23,748 --> 00:04:25,420
You and me, we're the Harpers.

71
00:04:27,177 --> 00:04:28,815
Us.

72
00:04:31,023 --> 00:04:33,457
Oh, Alan.

73
00:04:35,037 --> 00:04:36,516
Hi.

74
00:04:38,090 --> 00:04:40,763
Dr. Melnick. Is Jake all right?

75
00:04:41,351 --> 00:04:44,502
I assume so.
He's spending the night at a friend's.

76
00:04:44,863 --> 00:04:46,615
Oh, that's right, that's right.

77
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:50,943
Dr. Melnick is Jake's pediatrician,
so naturally, I thought...

78
00:04:56,780 --> 00:04:58,418
Oh, okay.

79
00:05:01,003 --> 00:05:03,597
Looks like somebody else
has given your wife the giraffe.

80
00:05:06,104 --> 00:05:09,062
Make sure they didn't forget
the garlic balls.

81
00:05:12,042 --> 00:05:13,680
What are you doing here?

82
00:05:13,923 --> 00:05:17,472
Why don't I just get back in the hot tub
and give you guys a minute.

83
00:05:19,066 --> 00:05:21,899
- Well?
- I came to give you this.

84
00:05:22,495 --> 00:05:26,124
- What is it?
- I made it for you.

85
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:31,072
- Just now?
- No, no, a long time ago.

86
00:05:32,906 --> 00:05:35,136
It's symbolic.

87
00:05:38,133 --> 00:05:41,364
Alan, you're a disturbed man.
You need help.

88
00:05:42,272 --> 00:05:44,069
Enjoy those garlic balls.

89
00:05:45,659 --> 00:05:48,173
Wow, that was more fun
than I expected.

90
00:05:48,669 --> 00:05:51,945
- Come on, giraffe boy, I'll buy you a drink.
- Okay.

91
00:05:52,265 --> 00:05:54,335
Wait, wait, wait.

92
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:09,890
Our pediatrician.

93
00:06:10,161 --> 00:06:16,760
My ex-wife is sleeping
with our pediatrician.

94
00:06:20,781 --> 00:06:23,056
I wonder if she gets a lollipop
after every visit.

95
00:06:30,858 --> 00:06:33,088
You know, you're actually
a very lucky man.

96
00:06:33,367 --> 00:06:36,723
Oh, really? Really? How am I lucky,
Charlie? Show me the luck.

97
00:06:37,047 --> 00:06:39,436
Well, first of all,
if Jake ever gets sick or hurt...

98
00:06:39,723 --> 00:06:41,839
free medical care is only
a hot tub away.

99
00:06:42,984 --> 00:06:45,817
Well, that's true.
He is good with kids.

100
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:48,156
I begged her to do it
with me in the hot tub.

101
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:50,888
She said it made her hair frizzy.

102
00:06:51,890 --> 00:06:54,768
Well, apparently, she's found
the right conditioner.

103
00:06:55,277 --> 00:06:58,394
What if she's serious about this guy?
What if she marries him?

104
00:06:58,873 --> 00:07:01,433
- Even better.
- Better?

105
00:07:01,716 --> 00:07:03,752
How is it better? Show me the better.

106
00:07:04,057 --> 00:07:06,525
If she marries him,
you're off the hook for alimony.

107
00:07:08,782 --> 00:07:10,659
That is better.

108
00:07:11,124 --> 00:07:14,719
In fact, if you saw the big picture,
you'd encourage this relationship.

109
00:07:15,054 --> 00:07:18,126
This guy is a real catch for you.
Don't let him get away.

110
00:07:18,650 --> 00:07:21,369
You're right.
Maybe I should go back there...

111
00:07:21,661 --> 00:07:25,620
and, you know, bless their union.
- No, no, no.

112
00:07:26,302 --> 00:07:28,054
You provided the woman
and the hot tub.

113
00:07:28,309 --> 00:07:32,382
- That's enough for one night.
- Yeah, I guess.

114
00:07:37,758 --> 00:07:41,273
- Probably even paid for the garlic balls.
- Yeah.

115
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:11,533
- Could I get some more coffee, Berta?
- Who's stopping you?

116
00:08:24,338 --> 00:08:25,771
Get your own damn coffee.

117
00:08:29,522 --> 00:08:32,912
- Well, Charlie, you're finally up.
- Hey, Mom.

118
00:08:34,247 --> 00:08:36,363
- Where's my grandson?
- He's at a sleepover.

119
00:08:36,631 --> 00:08:38,622
- He'll be here later.
- And no one calls me?

120
00:08:38,888 --> 00:08:41,322
I wouldn't come over if I'd been told
he wasn't here.

121
00:08:41,732 --> 00:08:43,609
Good to know.

122
00:08:43,864 --> 00:08:46,253
Where's your brother?
His car's not in the driveway.

123
00:08:46,582 --> 00:08:50,495
Hey, Mom, I'm not even sure
where my pants are.

124
00:08:51,014 --> 00:08:55,610
All right. Well, looks like you and I get to
spend a little quality time together.

125
00:08:56,492 --> 00:09:00,644
Gee, I'd love to, but I got my regular
Sunday morning softball game.

126
00:09:01,049 --> 00:09:02,323
- Charlie.
- Yeah.

127
00:09:02,554 --> 00:09:04,351
It's Saturday.

128
00:09:06,986 --> 00:09:08,863
Damn.

129
00:09:24,757 --> 00:09:28,033
- Oh, you're still here.
- Yeah.

130
00:09:28,353 --> 00:09:32,187
- Listen, Alan, I'm really sorry about...
- No, no, no. I should apologize to you.

131
00:09:32,534 --> 00:09:35,651
Showing up last night unannounced.
That's completely inappropriate.

132
00:09:35,963 --> 00:09:38,431
And I came by to tell you
it won't happen again.

133
00:09:41,398 --> 00:09:45,311
So you came over unannounced to
apologize for coming over unannounced?

134
00:09:46,207 --> 00:09:47,845
I was afraid you'd pick up on that.

135
00:09:49,384 --> 00:09:51,420
- Is Judith up yet?
- Actually, she's not here.

136
00:09:51,684 --> 00:09:53,675
She ran to the market.

137
00:09:53,984 --> 00:09:58,216
Up and out this early on a Saturday?
Good for her.

138
00:09:58,583 --> 00:10:00,699
She used to sleep a lot
when we were together.

139
00:10:00,966 --> 00:10:03,719
It was probably just the depression
and the meds.

140
00:10:05,566 --> 00:10:07,796
- Meds?
- Oh, no, it was nothing serious.

141
00:10:08,075 --> 00:10:12,227
Just your everyday little pink pill
to turn that frown upside down.

142
00:10:13,594 --> 00:10:15,869
Alan, I gotta tell you,
this is a little awkward...

143
00:10:16,144 --> 00:10:17,623
No, please, don't feel awkward.

144
00:10:17,859 --> 00:10:21,010
Look, we're obviously going
to be seeing each other a lot.

145
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:23,763
There's no reason for anybody
to feel uncomfortable.

146
00:10:25,051 --> 00:10:26,882
That's a very mature attitude.
Thank you.

147
00:10:27,183 --> 00:10:28,457
Well, you're welcome.

148
00:10:30,779 --> 00:10:33,009
So let me make you some coffee.

149
00:10:39,309 --> 00:10:40,742
Are we supposed to believe...

150
00:10:40,981 --> 00:10:45,099
that cavewomen waxed their legs
and wore fur bikinis?

151
00:10:45,497 --> 00:10:47,533
It's not a documentary, Mom.

152
00:10:52,103 --> 00:10:54,936
You know, I'm not gonna
be around forever...

153
00:10:55,239 --> 00:10:58,914
and the time will come
when you'll regret ignoring me.

154
00:11:02,682 --> 00:11:07,836
- Charlie, why do you hate me?
- What?

155
00:11:08,243 --> 00:11:12,122
Whenever I come, you do everything
you can to avoid spending time with me.

156
00:11:12,633 --> 00:11:14,225
Obviously not everything.

157
00:11:17,567 --> 00:11:19,319
We're spending time together
right now.

158
00:11:19,574 --> 00:11:23,169
You're just staring at the television,
and it's not even on anymore.

159
00:11:24,383 --> 00:11:26,817
I can still see you.

160
00:11:28,313 --> 00:11:30,873
Charlie, look at me.

161
00:11:40,689 --> 00:11:44,398
- How long you wanna do this for?
- I want you to talk to me.

162
00:11:45,038 --> 00:11:49,350
- Okay, I'm out of here.
- No, no, wait, Berta.

163
00:11:49,721 --> 00:11:53,396
- Come, sit, talk.
- Mommy-and-me time over already?

164
00:11:54,195 --> 00:11:56,629
- He hates me.
- No, I don't.

165
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:59,878
- Please, Berta, I need you.
- I'm done. I wanna go home.

166
00:12:00,174 --> 00:12:05,532
- Berta, I'm begging you.
- Oh, all right.

167
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:16,608
So why do you hate your mother?

168
00:12:20,495 --> 00:12:22,565
Here we go.

169
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:26,434
Coffee, juice, and my secret stash
of Mint Milanos...

170
00:12:26,725 --> 00:12:28,556
from the back of the freezer.

171
00:12:28,816 --> 00:12:32,286
Just a tip: If you want quality cookies
around here, you gotta hide them.

172
00:12:32,621 --> 00:12:35,419
Judith eats Pepperidge Farm
like she's going to the chair.

173
00:12:35,715 --> 00:12:39,788
So tell me a little bit about yourself.
Ever been married?

174
00:12:40,691 --> 00:12:45,128
- My wife passed away.
- Oh, I'm so sorry.

175
00:12:48,384 --> 00:12:50,261
No alimony, though. Gotta love that.

176
00:12:58,419 --> 00:13:00,216
Hey, hey, here's a funny thing.

177
00:13:03,018 --> 00:13:07,489
My name's Al and...
And I give Judith money.

178
00:13:07,869 --> 00:13:10,861
So it's... So it's alimony.

179
00:13:12,384 --> 00:13:17,139
- Wouldn't it be "Al-I-money"?
- I was afraid you'd pick up on that.

180
00:13:19,367 --> 00:13:21,676
- You got kids?
- No.

181
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:24,713
Well, that's a blessing.
What with the dead wife and all.

182
00:13:31,284 --> 00:13:34,082
- Mint Milanos?
- No, thank you.

183
00:13:35,172 --> 00:13:38,209
So anyway, kids. Hey, you know,
it's not too late for you.

184
00:13:38,517 --> 00:13:40,109
Judith is a wonderful mother.

185
00:13:40,733 --> 00:13:42,883
We're not at that stage
in our relationship.

186
00:13:43,159 --> 00:13:45,150
Oh, of course not.

187
00:13:45,625 --> 00:13:49,857
On the other hand, you don't wanna
wait too long. She's no spring chicken.

188
00:13:52,023 --> 00:13:53,820
You know, eggwise.

189
00:13:57,751 --> 00:14:00,948
So I'm having this nice Mother's Day
dinner with my slutty daughter...

190
00:14:01,263 --> 00:14:02,901
and her idiot boyfriend.

191
00:14:03,145 --> 00:14:06,774
Suddenly, the front door comes down
and the room fills with tear gas.

192
00:14:07,117 --> 00:14:10,268
Next thing I know, I'm belly-up
on the floor, hacking out a lung...

193
00:14:10,588 --> 00:14:13,819
while the cops are dragging out
Bonnie and Claude in handcuffs.

194
00:14:14,476 --> 00:14:18,549
Come to find out that the money that
I loaned them to open a tanning salon...

195
00:14:18,908 --> 00:14:22,787
was used to turn my tool shed
into a hydroponic pot farm.

196
00:14:23,508 --> 00:14:25,180
- Unbelievable.
- Yeah.

197
00:14:25,431 --> 00:14:28,150
Your daughter came to visit
on Mother's Day.

198
00:14:28,483 --> 00:14:32,112
Sure, what ungrateful mutt doesn't visit
their mother on Mother's Day?

199
00:14:36,846 --> 00:14:40,680
- One year I forgot. Let it go.
- When's my birthday?

200
00:14:42,449 --> 00:14:45,122
- Excuse me?
- You heard me.

201
00:14:46,630 --> 00:14:51,181
- What's that got to do with anything?
- You don't know your mother's birthday?

202
00:14:52,191 --> 00:14:55,342
- Well, not by heart.
- Charlie.

203
00:14:55,662 --> 00:15:00,895
- What? She changes it all the time.
- Just the year, not the day.

204
00:15:02,310 --> 00:15:04,778
Hey, I just realized something.
I can leave.

205
00:15:06,407 --> 00:15:09,604
Fine. But before you go,
just tell me one thing.

206
00:15:10,589 --> 00:15:12,739
- What?
- Why do you hate me?

207
00:15:13,056 --> 00:15:17,732
Oh, Mom, for God's sakes, l... Rose!

208
00:15:18,533 --> 00:15:23,129
No, no, no. Rose, wait.
Rose, come on in.

209
00:15:24,429 --> 00:15:28,183
Look, my mom's here.
You like my mom.

210
00:15:28,526 --> 00:15:31,757
- Oh, sure. Hi, Evelyn.
- Hello, dear.

211
00:15:33,753 --> 00:15:36,506
- Are those my pants?
- Oh, no.

212
00:15:36,805 --> 00:15:38,955
I bought these.

213
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:42,779
But I think this might be
your wallet and keys.

214
00:15:46,715 --> 00:15:48,945
Evelyn, you get younger
every time I see you.

215
00:15:49,223 --> 00:15:52,772
Oh, aren't you a dear.
And thank you for the birthday card.

216
00:15:53,112 --> 00:15:55,990
- Oh, did you get it on time?
- Yes, I did, and it was lovely.

217
00:15:56,290 --> 00:15:57,769
So sweet of you to remember me.

218
00:15:58,255 --> 00:16:00,371
How could anybody
forget your birthday?

219
00:16:06,785 --> 00:16:10,903
Well, yeah. You know, she does become
a little emotional at times, huh?

220
00:16:11,259 --> 00:16:13,329
I thought she was getting over
your divorce.

221
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:16,433
No, no. She was over the divorce
while I was still packing.

222
00:16:17,572 --> 00:16:21,963
No, what you're seeing
is low blood sugar.

223
00:16:22,339 --> 00:16:26,651
The trick to that is to always have
some Fun Size Snickers in your pocket.

224
00:16:27,022 --> 00:16:29,411
- It'll perk her right up.
- Really?

225
00:16:29,698 --> 00:16:32,053
Oh, yeah.
Oh, and here's another tip.

226
00:16:32,332 --> 00:16:36,928
When she starts crying for no reason,
and she will...

227
00:16:37,893 --> 00:16:41,806
never say, "Don't cry."
And try not to touch her.

228
00:16:42,158 --> 00:16:44,467
- Okay.
- Or whistle.

229
00:16:45,503 --> 00:16:48,176
Never, ever whistle.

230
00:16:52,653 --> 00:16:56,532
Okay, maybe I forgot a birthday or two.
Maybe I don't return every single call.

231
00:16:56,876 --> 00:16:59,265
But that doesn't mean I hate her.

232
00:16:59,594 --> 00:17:01,664
Was he breast-fed?

233
00:17:04,235 --> 00:17:08,274
Of course he was.
Not by me personally.

234
00:17:10,591 --> 00:17:13,310
That's interesting.
I see the bras that come through here...

235
00:17:13,601 --> 00:17:15,512
and he does tend to favor
the big yams.

236
00:17:15,775 --> 00:17:19,245
- I do not.
- Oh, really?

237
00:17:19,915 --> 00:17:24,033
- Raquel Welch.
- Hey, that's a damn fine film.

238
00:17:24,974 --> 00:17:27,249
Come to think of it,
the night we were together...

239
00:17:27,525 --> 00:17:31,518
he did spend a freakish amount of time
on my boobies.

240
00:17:33,379 --> 00:17:38,009
I mean, foreplay is one thing, but,
golly, it was like making love to a cat.

241
00:17:39,776 --> 00:17:42,085
Rose, for God's sake,
you're talking to my mother.

242
00:17:42,536 --> 00:17:45,573
Sorry. A very giving cat.

243
00:17:47,386 --> 00:17:49,024
He's always had an oral fixation.

244
00:17:49,267 --> 00:17:52,942
When he was little, he used to
suck on other children's thumbs.

245
00:17:53,281 --> 00:17:55,795
And now he's always got a bottle
of booze in his mouth.

246
00:17:56,125 --> 00:17:58,844
My therapist says that's his way
of stuffing his feelings.

247
00:17:59,135 --> 00:18:03,208
- That's what my therapist says.
- Hell, I could've told you that for free.

248
00:18:05,574 --> 00:18:07,883
- Hey, I'm here.
- Hey, it's Jake.

249
00:18:08,334 --> 00:18:12,247
Back from his sleepover.
Look who's here to see you, buddy.

250
00:18:12,599 --> 00:18:14,510
Hi, Grandma.

251
00:18:15,149 --> 00:18:20,348
Hello, sweetheart.
Thank you for the lovely birthday card.

252
00:18:20,752 --> 00:18:24,586
- My mom picked it out.
- Oh, and you love her, don't you?

253
00:18:24,933 --> 00:18:28,812
- Sure.
- Thank you. You can go now.

254
00:18:29,742 --> 00:18:32,575
- Can I go too?
- We're not done with you.

255
00:18:33,338 --> 00:18:35,533
- Where were we?
- We were trying to figure out...

256
00:18:35,805 --> 00:18:38,194
why Charlie hates you.
- Yeah.

257
00:18:38,481 --> 00:18:40,631
Well, Charlie?

258
00:18:41,408 --> 00:18:43,524
Okay, fine, here it is.

259
00:18:43,791 --> 00:18:46,100
I'm not saying I hate you,
but if I did...

260
00:18:46,383 --> 00:18:49,978
it might have to do with the fact that
you're a narcissistic bloodsucker...

261
00:18:50,314 --> 00:18:52,828
who drove my father
into an early grave.

262
00:18:53,115 --> 00:18:56,630
Then married a succession of men who
couldn't care less about Alan and me...

263
00:18:56,962 --> 00:18:58,281
which was fine with you...

264
00:18:58,509 --> 00:19:00,818
because you looked at us
like dancing monkeys...

265
00:19:01,101 --> 00:19:03,615
you could just haul out
whenever it suited you.

266
00:19:03,903 --> 00:19:06,940
And when it didn't, you sent us off
to boarding school or camp...

267
00:19:07,248 --> 00:19:09,637
or that kibbutz in Israel,
where we got beat up...

268
00:19:09,924 --> 00:19:11,915
because we weren't even Jewish!

269
00:19:14,523 --> 00:19:17,754
And now, now you show up here
every chance you get...

270
00:19:18,077 --> 00:19:19,510
to lay a guilt trip on me...

271
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:24,266
for not appreciating my cold,
Ionely, loveless childhood.

272
00:19:27,903 --> 00:19:29,495
Well...

273
00:19:31,499 --> 00:19:33,694
obviously you're not ready
to talk about it.

274
00:19:40,489 --> 00:19:44,243
- Alan, you really don't have to do this.
- Hey, hey, I am a licensed chiropractor.

275
00:19:44,586 --> 00:19:48,295
If Jake had a sore throat, I'm sure you'd
treat him, prescribe something.

276
00:19:48,642 --> 00:19:50,678
But it's nothing,
I think I just slept wrong.

277
00:19:50,942 --> 00:19:53,661
Oh, that's probably because
you're not used to our bed.

278
00:19:57,339 --> 00:19:59,853
So have you...? Have you met
Judith's parents?

279
00:20:00,141 --> 00:20:02,860
- No.
- Oh, they are just gonna love you.

280
00:20:03,151 --> 00:20:04,789
They were devastated by the divorce.

281
00:20:05,033 --> 00:20:08,070
Not to mention some of her
unfortunate choices thereafter.

282
00:20:09,339 --> 00:20:12,490
- Unfortunate choices?
- Oh, you know, that's not important.

283
00:20:12,810 --> 00:20:16,644
What's important is they're just gonna
be relieved to see she's dating a man.

284
00:20:19,667 --> 00:20:22,545
You carry a lot of tension up here.

285
00:20:24,476 --> 00:20:26,228
Alan.

286
00:20:34,385 --> 00:20:37,502
- Didn't you just pay your alimony?
- This is the pediatrician's bill.

287
00:20:38,023 --> 00:20:39,820
- Jake was sick?
- No, no.

288
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:43,189
The pediatrician had to see
an orthopedist.

289
00:20:45,131 --> 00:20:47,326
You know Mom's birthday
was a couple weeks ago?

290
00:20:47,765 --> 00:20:49,721
Yeah, I sent her some flowers
and a card.

291
00:20:50,023 --> 00:20:52,901
Oh, man. Would it have killed you
to put my name on the card?

292
00:20:53,201 --> 00:20:57,353
I did put your name on it. I wrote,
"Love, your sons, Alan and Charlie."

293
00:20:57,926 --> 00:20:59,405
- Damn.
- What?

294
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:02,598
She tricked me into thinking I forgot.
