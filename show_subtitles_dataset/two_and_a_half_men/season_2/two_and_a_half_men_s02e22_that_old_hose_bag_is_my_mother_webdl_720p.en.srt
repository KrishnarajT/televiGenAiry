1
00:00:01,900 --> 00:00:04,619
Charlie? Where's Charlie?

2
00:00:04,954 --> 00:00:06,387
Check the living room.

3
00:00:06,627 --> 00:00:09,346
- Charlie, guess what?
- Somebody call me?

4
00:00:09,681 --> 00:00:11,433
Not me.

5
00:00:13,822 --> 00:00:15,096
He's not in the living room.

6
00:00:15,370 --> 00:00:16,962
- Try his bedroom.
- Thanks.

7
00:00:17,210 --> 00:00:18,768
Charlie, you gotta see this.

8
00:00:19,302 --> 00:00:20,815
Are you sure nobody's calling me?

9
00:00:21,644 --> 00:00:22,918
Wouldn't I tell you?

10
00:00:25,911 --> 00:00:27,902
Berta, he's not in his room.

11
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:31,003
- What?
- I said, he's not in his room.

12
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:33,113
What?

13
00:00:34,737 --> 00:00:37,046
- Did you find him?
- He's not up there.

14
00:00:37,666 --> 00:00:40,100
- Try Jake's room.
- What'd he be doing in Jake's room?

15
00:00:40,427 --> 00:00:42,145
Hey, I'm just trying to help.

16
00:00:42,685 --> 00:00:45,677
I'm sorry. Charlie!

17
00:00:46,618 --> 00:00:48,336
I'm sure I heard something.

18
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,235
I don't know what to tell you.

19
00:00:53,561 --> 00:00:56,155
I could do this all day.

20
00:01:10,419 --> 00:01:11,693
Charlie.

21
00:01:11,925 --> 00:01:13,199
Hey, Alan.

22
00:01:13,431 --> 00:01:16,264
- Didn't you hear me calling you?
- Oh, that was you.

23
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:18,680
Of course it was me.
Who else would it be?

24
00:01:18,995 --> 00:01:20,553
Don't snap at me.

25
00:01:20,794 --> 00:01:22,750
I've been running all over
looking for you.

26
00:01:23,011 --> 00:01:24,285
Well, I was right here.

27
00:01:24,517 --> 00:01:27,031
I know that now.

28
00:01:27,528 --> 00:01:29,564
Hey, that's no reason
to have a hissy fit.

29
00:01:29,829 --> 00:01:32,787
Hissy fit? This is not a hissy fit.

30
00:01:33,468 --> 00:01:36,858
Say it higher, Alan. A couple of dogs
in the neighborhood didn't hear you.

31
00:01:38,990 --> 00:01:40,582
I'm all done. I'm going home now.

32
00:01:40,831 --> 00:01:42,105
- Thank you.
- Good night.

33
00:01:42,755 --> 00:01:44,791
Good night, my pets.

34
00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:48,489
Now that you've managed to find me,
what do you want?

35
00:01:48,779 --> 00:01:52,010
There was something I was excited
to show you, but now I don't want to.

36
00:01:52,334 --> 00:01:54,768
- I'm okay with that.
- So am I.

37
00:01:55,053 --> 00:01:56,645
Oh, come on. You gotta see this.

38
00:01:57,940 --> 00:01:59,896
All right. Fine.

39
00:02:00,701 --> 00:02:02,259
Hey. Wait a minute.

40
00:02:02,499 --> 00:02:04,296
Did Berta know you were out here?

41
00:02:04,549 --> 00:02:07,347
Very mature, Alan. Blame the maid.

42
00:02:12,246 --> 00:02:13,759
Oh, you bought a Porsche.

43
00:02:14,421 --> 00:02:17,697
"Porsche." What do you think?

44
00:02:19,608 --> 00:02:20,961
It's cute.

45
00:02:21,323 --> 00:02:22,597
What do you mean, cute?

46
00:02:22,829 --> 00:02:25,343
I mean, it looks like my car's
hot little girlfriend.

47
00:02:27,347 --> 00:02:30,817
Are you saying this is a chick car?
Because it isn't. It's a Porsche.

48
00:02:31,321 --> 00:02:32,800
Yeah. The cute little one.

49
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:35,491
No, no, no. It's the sporty one.

50
00:02:36,801 --> 00:02:38,632
If your sport is girls' basketball.

51
00:02:39,185 --> 00:02:42,700
No, no, it's got the fuel injection,
and the rack and the pinion...

52
00:02:43,034 --> 00:02:45,343
and the leather thingy
to cover the hood.

53
00:02:45,962 --> 00:02:47,554
That's called a bra, Alan.

54
00:02:47,844 --> 00:02:50,438
Yeah, but it's made of leather.

55
00:02:51,609 --> 00:02:54,123
- All right. Whatever.
- It is not a chick car.

56
00:02:54,412 --> 00:02:57,449
The salesman showed me brochures
with pictures of guys driving it.

57
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:00,455
Alan, if a monkey walked
into the dealership...

58
00:03:00,728 --> 00:03:03,367
he'd have been shown
pictures of monkeys driving it.

59
00:03:04,368 --> 00:03:06,438
Monkeys can't drive a stick.

60
00:03:08,174 --> 00:03:11,644
Now, come on.
We'll go for a spin, pick up Jake.

61
00:03:12,148 --> 00:03:14,104
Where'd you get the money for this?

62
00:03:14,365 --> 00:03:15,354
Where'd you get it...

63
00:03:15,578 --> 00:03:18,570
because they're not cheap.
- No, no, they are not.

64
00:03:22,229 --> 00:03:23,821
Where'd you get the money for this?

65
00:03:26,287 --> 00:03:28,039
The money. Where'd you get it?

66
00:03:28,295 --> 00:03:30,650
Oh, I got it from...

67
00:03:31,474 --> 00:03:34,625
- What?
- I got a loan from...

68
00:03:37,791 --> 00:03:39,827
Alan, where'd the money come from?

69
00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:42,626
I found it.

70
00:03:43,563 --> 00:03:45,838
- Alan?
- Mom.

71
00:03:46,115 --> 00:03:48,185
You traded your soul for a Porsche.

72
00:03:48,458 --> 00:03:52,497
I didn't trade my soul,
and it's "Porsche."

73
00:03:54,147 --> 00:03:55,660
Alan, why didn't you come to me?

74
00:03:55,904 --> 00:03:57,462
No, I already owe you so much.

75
00:03:57,702 --> 00:04:00,341
You won't let me pay rent
and you pay all the utilities.

76
00:04:00,672 --> 00:04:02,788
Keeping that in mind,
did you ever consider...

77
00:04:03,057 --> 00:04:05,651
taking the money from Mom
and paying me back?

78
00:04:09,122 --> 00:04:10,874
No, not really.

79
00:04:11,548 --> 00:04:14,984
Come on. Let me show you
what this baby can do.

80
00:04:20,458 --> 00:04:24,007
Well, what do you know?
Monkeys can drive a stick.

81
00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:29,765
You know, the salesman was right.

82
00:04:30,038 --> 00:04:32,347
You really do feel special
in one of these things.

83
00:04:32,631 --> 00:04:35,589
Oh, yeah. Probably not a lot
of middle-aged, divorced guys...

84
00:04:35,894 --> 00:04:38,089
driving around L.A. In a Porsche.

85
00:04:38,739 --> 00:04:40,809
"Porsche."

86
00:04:41,081 --> 00:04:43,276
Oh, wait, I forgot to show you
the best part.

87
00:04:48,444 --> 00:04:51,322
Alan, that's a NASCAR hat.

88
00:04:51,623 --> 00:04:53,659
Yeah, they were
out of the Porsche hats.

89
00:04:53,923 --> 00:04:57,040
I wanted something that said speed
and performance, so I got this.

90
00:04:57,354 --> 00:05:01,188
What you should be wearing
is a hat with a propeller on top.

91
00:05:01,997 --> 00:05:03,555
Come on, open her up.

92
00:05:03,796 --> 00:05:05,832
The first 1000 miles
is the break-in period.

93
00:05:06,096 --> 00:05:07,893
You're not supposed to go over 65.

94
00:05:08,146 --> 00:05:09,545
Well, then go 65.

95
00:05:09,777 --> 00:05:12,166
The speed limit is 60.
You want me to get a ticket?

96
00:05:12,455 --> 00:05:14,810
Alan, you're driving
an expensive red sports car.

97
00:05:15,090 --> 00:05:18,446
If you're not getting tickets and tail,
you might as well take the bus.

98
00:05:18,771 --> 00:05:21,205
Which, by the way, just passed us.

99
00:05:22,285 --> 00:05:25,436
I am going plenty fast,
thank you very much.

100
00:05:25,757 --> 00:05:27,349
Can we at least put the top down?

101
00:05:27,597 --> 00:05:30,953
No, I wanna trap the new-car smell in
as long as I can.

102
00:05:31,279 --> 00:05:33,713
Man, are you anal-retentive.

103
00:05:33,998 --> 00:05:37,877
You need a bumper sticker that reads,
"My other car is a puckered rectum."

104
00:05:39,143 --> 00:05:43,295
Oh, yeah. Like I'd desecrate this car
with a bumper sticker.

105
00:05:49,601 --> 00:05:51,831
God, I love that sound.

106
00:05:56,628 --> 00:05:58,903
Will you stop it?

107
00:06:12,608 --> 00:06:15,884
Jake, your dad's here.
Where's your car?

108
00:06:16,205 --> 00:06:18,594
Oh, my car? My car is...

109
00:06:20,974 --> 00:06:22,248
right there.

110
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:25,153
- You got a Porsche?
- "Porsche."

111
00:06:26,621 --> 00:06:29,897
I have to struggle to make ends meet,
and you can buy a Porsche?

112
00:06:32,854 --> 00:06:35,652
What are you talking about?
Your ends have not only met...

113
00:06:35,950 --> 00:06:38,544
they've been to Hawaii
and remodeled the kitchen.

114
00:06:38,836 --> 00:06:41,430
Don't change the subject.
How can you afford a fancy car?

115
00:06:42,141 --> 00:06:44,371
Well, I can't afford it, really.

116
00:06:44,692 --> 00:06:46,284
Maybe I have to call my attorney.

117
00:06:46,533 --> 00:06:49,286
And re-examine our whole
alimony/child-support agreement.

118
00:06:49,587 --> 00:06:51,384
No, no, you don't.

119
00:06:52,724 --> 00:06:55,284
It wasn't very expensive.

120
00:06:56,656 --> 00:06:58,886
This is the girl version. Right, Charlie?

121
00:06:59,166 --> 00:07:03,318
Oh, yeah, yeah. You've gotta kiss it
before you can even stick the key in.

122
00:07:03,684 --> 00:07:07,120
Judith, you have nothing to worry about.
You've successfully sucked me dry.

123
00:07:07,448 --> 00:07:10,008
Absolutely. This guy's farting dust.

124
00:07:10,293 --> 00:07:12,648
Then where'd he get
the money for the car?

125
00:07:13,681 --> 00:07:15,114
He borrowed it from our mother.

126
00:07:15,355 --> 00:07:17,585
Give me a break.
Even Alan's not that stupid.

127
00:07:17,864 --> 00:07:19,377
Oh, but he is.

128
00:07:19,621 --> 00:07:21,976
I am. I swear to God.

129
00:07:24,223 --> 00:07:27,533
- Hey, cool car. Is it yours?
- Yeah.

130
00:07:29,368 --> 00:07:31,757
We're gonna have to talk
about my allowance.

131
00:07:34,722 --> 00:07:36,553
Okay, well, have a nice weekend.

132
00:07:37,232 --> 00:07:39,951
Wait a minute. That's a two-seater.
Where's he gonna sit?

133
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:47,819
And you didn't believe
he was that stupid.

134
00:07:55,345 --> 00:07:57,984
We're going way over
the speed limit.

135
00:07:58,273 --> 00:08:02,152
Let me worry about that.
You just keep looking for cops.

136
00:08:09,651 --> 00:08:12,563
I don't usually take a cab.

137
00:08:13,123 --> 00:08:17,639
I drive a red Boxster.
You know, Porsche.

138
00:08:18,394 --> 00:08:20,749
- Those are very nice.
- Thank you.

139
00:08:21,030 --> 00:08:23,100
My sister has one.

140
00:08:28,852 --> 00:08:31,491
- Hey, Berta. You seen my brother?
- Did you check his room?

141
00:08:31,989 --> 00:08:33,502
Thanks.

142
00:08:34,457 --> 00:08:38,336
Sweetie, it is a beautiful car.
Congratulations.

143
00:08:38,682 --> 00:08:42,436
- Thanks, Mom. I'm really enjoying it.
- Well, your Aunt Sylvia loves hers.

144
00:08:43,284 --> 00:08:44,683
Berta, have you seen Charlie?

145
00:08:44,915 --> 00:08:46,268
Look out on the deck.

146
00:08:50,813 --> 00:08:52,883
- I was looking for you.
- I was in the garage.

147
00:08:53,156 --> 00:08:55,351
- I was looking for you.
- I was looking for Alan.

148
00:08:55,624 --> 00:08:57,182
I was in the garage.

149
00:08:59,138 --> 00:09:00,651
Okay. Bye.

150
00:09:04,659 --> 00:09:07,253
Oh, sure. Blame the maid.

151
00:09:08,843 --> 00:09:12,631
Oh, Alan, before I forget,
I need to ask you for a little favor.

152
00:09:13,193 --> 00:09:14,831
Your soul, please.

153
00:09:15,368 --> 00:09:17,245
Charlie, for God's sake...

154
00:09:17,502 --> 00:09:19,936
Careful. I don't think
you're allowed to say "God"...

155
00:09:20,221 --> 00:09:22,371
without bursting into flames
or something.

156
00:09:22,981 --> 00:09:25,541
Shush with your antichrist humor.

157
00:09:25,826 --> 00:09:27,976
It's getting old.

158
00:09:28,252 --> 00:09:30,925
Alan, I'd like you to join me
for dinner tomorrow night.

159
00:09:31,222 --> 00:09:34,180
- Why?
- I'm dating a man I'd like you to meet.

160
00:09:34,987 --> 00:09:36,261
And?

161
00:09:36,535 --> 00:09:39,003
He has a lovely daughter about your age.

162
00:09:39,296 --> 00:09:41,366
Sayeth the serpent.

163
00:09:43,479 --> 00:09:46,915
No. Mom, please, please,
please, no blind dates.

164
00:09:47,244 --> 00:09:51,362
Why not? She's a sweet girl
and I think you might really hit it off.

165
00:09:51,761 --> 00:09:55,276
- Why can't Charlie go out with her?
- Hey, she didn't buy me a car.

166
00:09:56,363 --> 00:09:59,161
This has absolutely nothing
to do with the car.

167
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:01,809
Besides, I want
to get closer to this man.

168
00:10:02,135 --> 00:10:04,444
Should the time come
when I want an ugly breakup...

169
00:10:04,729 --> 00:10:07,197
I'll let you
take a crack at his daughter.

170
00:10:07,490 --> 00:10:09,208
I'm sorry, Mom. But I'd rather not.

171
00:10:09,456 --> 00:10:12,334
Alan, I bought you a car.

172
00:10:15,145 --> 00:10:17,705
I love the smell of brimstone
in the morning.

173
00:10:20,625 --> 00:10:22,502
Tomorrow night, 8:00, Le Pissoir.

174
00:10:23,804 --> 00:10:26,364
- I really appreciate this, darling.
- Sure.

175
00:10:26,649 --> 00:10:30,801
Oh, one more thing. She's been
through a rough patch lately...

176
00:10:31,166 --> 00:10:33,885
so we won't be ordering alcohol.

177
00:10:34,178 --> 00:10:35,213
Bye-bye.

178
00:10:43,381 --> 00:10:44,894
No, really. She sounds great.

179
00:10:55,345 --> 00:10:58,178
Looks like my mom and your dad
are running a little late.

180
00:10:59,277 --> 00:11:00,949
Typical.

181
00:11:02,623 --> 00:11:05,774
Yeah. So you're in town
for the weekend. Where do you live?

182
00:11:06,514 --> 00:11:08,391
Palm Springs.

183
00:11:08,647 --> 00:11:10,763
That's nice.
How long have you lived there?

184
00:11:12,161 --> 00:11:14,311
Forty-two days, so far.

185
00:11:15,549 --> 00:11:16,868
Forty-two days?

186
00:11:17,599 --> 00:11:20,557
Yeah. This is my first weekend pass.

187
00:11:23,957 --> 00:11:27,950
I was supposed to get one at 30,
but I bit a guy.

188
00:11:29,479 --> 00:11:32,152
- Would you like a cocktail?
- No, no, no cocktails. No.

189
00:11:32,449 --> 00:11:34,963
- No, that's all right. You can have one.
- No, I'm fine.

190
00:11:35,252 --> 00:11:37,322
- Oh, please. Go ahead.
- No. I don't think...

191
00:11:37,594 --> 00:11:40,631
Order a drink, damn it.
I wanna smell it.

192
00:11:43,534 --> 00:11:46,651
We're fine. Maybe just a fizzy water.

193
00:11:48,303 --> 00:11:49,656
So, what do you do?

194
00:11:51,775 --> 00:11:53,094
I'm a chiropractor.

195
00:11:53,365 --> 00:11:56,402
Really? Can you prescribe stuff?

196
00:11:57,297 --> 00:11:58,776
No.

197
00:12:04,241 --> 00:12:05,594
Did you hear that?

198
00:12:06,081 --> 00:12:09,437
- It's my phone.
- Oh, thank God.

199
00:12:11,645 --> 00:12:14,955
Hello? Oh, hey, Mom. Where are you?

200
00:12:15,284 --> 00:12:17,275
Yes, she's here.

201
00:12:17,543 --> 00:12:22,253
Yes, very sweet. Where are you?

202
00:12:24,403 --> 00:12:26,155
Trudy, Trudy, there's no smoking.

203
00:12:27,122 --> 00:12:31,081
Oh, that's just great.
Just jim-freaking-dandy.

204
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:36,899
You guys are coming, right?
Well, what am I supposed to do?

205
00:12:39,504 --> 00:12:41,460
Yes, I know you bought me a car.

206
00:12:42,642 --> 00:12:45,475
All right, all right. All right. Goodbye.

207
00:12:47,745 --> 00:12:50,817
Apparently, your father mixed up
his heart pills with his Viagra...

208
00:12:51,133 --> 00:12:53,363
and they didn't wanna
waste the opportunity.

209
00:12:53,978 --> 00:12:55,491
So he's not coming?

210
00:12:55,986 --> 00:12:57,783
Well...

211
00:12:59,667 --> 00:13:02,659
Perfect. Just perfect.

212
00:13:02,972 --> 00:13:06,009
That son of a bitch
never cared about me.

213
00:13:06,318 --> 00:13:07,592
Trudy, Trudy...

214
00:13:08,619 --> 00:13:12,771
He'd rather spend the night
with some old hose bag.

215
00:13:15,479 --> 00:13:17,356
That old hose bag is my mother...

216
00:13:17,612 --> 00:13:20,172
and there's still no smoking in here.
I'm sorry.

217
00:13:20,457 --> 00:13:23,529
Careful. I bit the last guy
who tried to touch me.

218
00:13:28,656 --> 00:13:32,615
Yeah, well, that doesn't mean
we can't have a nice meal.

219
00:13:33,257 --> 00:13:34,531
I'll call the waiter.

220
00:13:35,391 --> 00:13:39,179
Hello, hello.
Yeah, we're ready to order.

221
00:13:46,225 --> 00:13:49,376
Remind me to get some clean urine
from you before we go.

222
00:13:54,424 --> 00:13:57,097
- Two hundred forty pounds...
- What are you doing?

223
00:13:57,812 --> 00:13:59,404
Picking off the pepperonis.

224
00:14:00,071 --> 00:14:01,902
Then why'd you order it
with pepperonis?

225
00:14:02,372 --> 00:14:04,408
I like to stack them up
and eat them in bed.

226
00:14:08,479 --> 00:14:11,039
Hello? Hey, Mom.

227
00:14:11,324 --> 00:14:12,916
No, Dad's not here. He's on a date.

228
00:14:14,796 --> 00:14:17,310
Hang on. Uncle Charlie's talking to me.
Yeah?

229
00:14:17,598 --> 00:14:19,748
Don't tell your mom
your father's on a date.

230
00:14:20,025 --> 00:14:22,016
- It's none of her business.
- Okay.

231
00:14:22,283 --> 00:14:24,194
He's not on a date.

232
00:14:25,128 --> 00:14:27,403
Hang on. She wants to talk to you.

233
00:14:29,102 --> 00:14:31,138
Uncle Charlie's not here.

234
00:14:34,833 --> 00:14:36,391
Give me that.

235
00:14:36,715 --> 00:14:38,467
Hey, Judith. What's up?

236
00:14:38,765 --> 00:14:41,723
Well, he's not a bright kid.
What do you want from me?

237
00:14:44,078 --> 00:14:45,636
I don't know where Alan is.

238
00:14:45,876 --> 00:14:47,673
Would you like me
to give him a message?

239
00:14:47,926 --> 00:14:50,394
Because who knows?
Maybe this time I will.

240
00:14:52,778 --> 00:14:54,416
No message.

241
00:14:56,167 --> 00:14:57,998
How come it's a secret
Dad's on a date?

242
00:14:58,802 --> 00:15:02,715
It's not. It's just never a good idea to tell
women more than they need to know.

243
00:15:03,194 --> 00:15:04,547
How come?

244
00:15:04,784 --> 00:15:07,014
Because we love them
and want to protect them.

245
00:15:07,294 --> 00:15:09,091
A clueless woman is a happy woman.

246
00:15:15,786 --> 00:15:18,016
- Can I have your pepperonis?
- No.

247
00:15:22,939 --> 00:15:25,055
Batman!

248
00:15:26,536 --> 00:15:29,653
Come on. Come on, Trudy.
Come on. Come on.

249
00:15:29,966 --> 00:15:32,560
- Let's get you back to the Batcave...
- Oh, right.

250
00:15:32,853 --> 00:15:34,730
or whatever cave
you crawled out of.

251
00:15:34,986 --> 00:15:39,741
Thank you, kind sir.
You are indeed a gentleman.

252
00:15:40,131 --> 00:15:43,521
Allow me to reward you.

253
00:15:48,874 --> 00:15:54,585
A salty! I shall now need a slice of lime
and a carafe of tequila.

254
00:15:55,525 --> 00:15:57,322
No, thank you. No, no, we're fine.

255
00:15:57,575 --> 00:16:00,214
Hey, come on, Trudy.
Let's take you home.

256
00:16:00,503 --> 00:16:04,291
Okay. But we'll have to be
really quiet...

257
00:16:04,644 --> 00:16:08,762
because my roommate is detoxing,
so she's kind of a light sleeper.

258
00:16:10,082 --> 00:16:12,232
No, no, I meant home to your father.

259
00:16:12,509 --> 00:16:14,704
Oh, God.

260
00:16:14,977 --> 00:16:17,047
Daddy!

261
00:16:17,319 --> 00:16:22,837
Oh, I'm such a disappointment to you.

262
00:16:23,259 --> 00:16:27,537
Hey, your aftershave has alcohol in it.

263
00:16:37,189 --> 00:16:38,747
So why is Dad's car a chick car?

264
00:16:39,824 --> 00:16:42,463
It's not really. I was just saying that
to bust his chops.

265
00:16:44,677 --> 00:16:46,827
Chops are your nuts, right?

266
00:16:48,734 --> 00:16:50,167
Right.

267
00:16:50,617 --> 00:16:52,573
Mom said it's a midlife-crisis car.

268
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:56,540
Well, she was bound to be right
about something eventually.

269
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:01,461
What's a midlife crisis?

270
00:17:02,832 --> 00:17:06,302
Well, Jake, it's when a man
starts facing his own mortality...

271
00:17:06,638 --> 00:17:08,868
and tries to recapture his youth.

272
00:17:09,901 --> 00:17:11,857
I've had one of those.

273
00:17:13,457 --> 00:17:15,049
Do tell.

274
00:17:16,468 --> 00:17:19,346
Life was so much simpler
when I was 6.

275
00:17:23,287 --> 00:17:25,084
Hello? Hey, Dad.

276
00:17:25,337 --> 00:17:27,726
Listen, don't worry
about your midlife crisis.

277
00:17:28,014 --> 00:17:30,892
They usually go away
over summer vacation.

278
00:17:32,866 --> 00:17:35,300
He wants to talk to you.
Are you here?

279
00:17:37,510 --> 00:17:40,866
Yeah. Whoa, slow down.

280
00:17:41,191 --> 00:17:43,102
Well, how drunk is she?

281
00:17:44,495 --> 00:17:47,453
Really? Batman drunk?

282
00:17:49,850 --> 00:17:52,159
Well, just dump her
with Mom and her father.

283
00:17:52,443 --> 00:17:53,796
Where are they?

284
00:17:55,204 --> 00:17:57,081
Viagra and a bad ticker.

285
00:17:57,338 --> 00:17:59,898
Mom loses more boyfriends that way.

286
00:18:00,433 --> 00:18:03,345
Alan, calm down, calm down.
Listen to me. Here's what you do:

287
00:18:03,654 --> 00:18:05,133
Take her to a club...

288
00:18:05,369 --> 00:18:08,441
pin a warning note on her back
as a courtesy to the next guy...

289
00:18:08,757 --> 00:18:10,713
and run like hell.

290
00:18:11,853 --> 00:18:15,163
Well, if you don't want my advice,
why'd you call me?

291
00:18:16,245 --> 00:18:17,598
Okay, how about this:

292
00:18:17,835 --> 00:18:20,508
Put the top down
and let the night air sober her up.

293
00:18:23,147 --> 00:18:25,536
What's plan B?

294
00:18:32,601 --> 00:18:34,512
How come you don't have
a date tonight?

295
00:18:34,776 --> 00:18:36,573
I decided I'd rather hang out with you.

296
00:18:36,826 --> 00:18:38,498
- Really?
- No.

297
00:18:40,089 --> 00:18:41,886
You're saying that to bust my chops.

298
00:18:42,683 --> 00:18:44,162
No.

299
00:18:46,531 --> 00:18:48,681
- Hey.
- Hey.

300
00:18:48,957 --> 00:18:50,948
- How was your date?
- Oh, lots of fun.

301
00:18:51,258 --> 00:18:53,772
- Think you'll marry her?
- Doubtful. Charlie?

302
00:18:56,612 --> 00:18:59,080
What happened?
You take her to a club and ditch her?

303
00:18:59,373 --> 00:19:00,886
- No, I couldn't do that.
- Why not?

304
00:19:01,130 --> 00:19:02,768
Well, it's cheesy and immoral...

305
00:19:03,012 --> 00:19:06,209
and I'm really not comfortable
having some valet touch my car.

306
00:19:07,070 --> 00:19:08,947
- So where is she?
- In the garage.

307
00:19:09,203 --> 00:19:10,921
- Oh, Alan.
- Well, she passed out.

308
00:19:11,170 --> 00:19:14,048
- I figured I'd let her sleep it off.
- You left her in your car?

309
00:19:14,349 --> 00:19:15,862
Why not?

310
00:19:30,998 --> 00:19:33,034
Well, at least she left
the garage door open.

311
00:19:40,284 --> 00:19:43,276
It's a red Porsche Boxster
with dealer plates.

312
00:19:44,676 --> 00:19:48,351
"Porsche."
Yeah, about an hour ago.

313
00:19:48,692 --> 00:19:51,365
Hey, Dad, check it out.
Your car's on TV.

314
00:19:56,891 --> 00:19:58,882
I'll call you back.

315
00:19:59,234 --> 00:20:02,306
- chase so far. The suspect was
first spotted in Malibu...

316
00:20:02,622 --> 00:20:04,214
on the Pacific Coast Highway...

317
00:20:04,462 --> 00:20:06,896
and is now southbound
on the 405 freeway.

318
00:20:07,223 --> 00:20:08,622
Oh, God!

319
00:20:08,897 --> 00:20:12,333
Don't worry. I've watched
hundreds of these. They never make it.

320
00:20:12,661 --> 00:20:16,256
- she just ran over the nail strips
that the Highway Patrol laid out.

321
00:20:16,844 --> 00:20:18,994
Oh, man, look at the sparks.

322
00:20:19,563 --> 00:20:22,077
That's because
she's riding on rims, Jake.

323
00:20:22,366 --> 00:20:25,085
You gotta like
how your car handles without tires.

324
00:20:25,838 --> 00:20:27,510
Oh, God!

325
00:20:27,762 --> 00:20:29,400
Whoa, that was a close call.

326
00:20:29,645 --> 00:20:33,684
She sideswiped that SUV
and kept right on going.

327
00:20:34,037 --> 00:20:36,153
What's that dragging
alongside Dad's car?

328
00:20:36,421 --> 00:20:38,651
I think that's the door.

329
00:20:39,182 --> 00:20:42,219
- Cool.
- Oh, God!

330
00:20:42,529 --> 00:20:45,407
Dale, this is Trish in the studio.
Can you see the suspect?

331
00:20:45,708 --> 00:20:47,141
How do you know it's a woman?

332
00:20:47,381 --> 00:20:49,770
Well, Trish, we actually
don 't know it's a woman...

333
00:20:50,058 --> 00:20:53,892
but thought it was a safe bet
based on the type of car.

334
00:20:54,283 --> 00:20:57,434
It's not a chick car.

335
00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:01,162
Relax, Dad.
He's just busting your chops.
