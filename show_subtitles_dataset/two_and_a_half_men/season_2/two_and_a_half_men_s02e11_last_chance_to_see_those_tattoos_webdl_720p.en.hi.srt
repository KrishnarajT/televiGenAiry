1
00:00:03,301 --> 00:00:05,512
Two white wines
and a Jack and ginger.

2
00:00:06,304 --> 00:00:08,723
Please tell me the Jack and ginger
isn't for you.

3
00:00:08,890 --> 00:00:10,976
No, it's for my girlfriend. Why?

4
00:00:11,726 --> 00:00:14,062
You look like a woman of
discriminating taste...

5
00:00:14,229 --> 00:00:16,606
and mixing a quality
bourbon with ginger ale...

6
00:00:16,773 --> 00:00:20,485
is like putting Cheez Whiz
on lobster Newburgh.

7
00:00:21,861 --> 00:00:24,447
Well, what if I said
the Jack and ginger was for me?

8
00:00:25,031 --> 00:00:27,659
Well, then, I'd learn to live with it.

9
00:00:29,536 --> 00:00:32,163
- Charlie.
- Gail.

10
00:00:32,872 --> 00:00:36,668
Sorry I'm late. I stopped off at Radio
Barn, and wait till you see what I got.

11
00:00:36,835 --> 00:00:38,878
Alan, I'm kind of in the middle of...

12
00:00:41,798 --> 00:00:43,508
Damn you to hell.

13
00:00:43,675 --> 00:00:45,844
- What? What did I do?
- Forget it.

14
00:00:46,011 --> 00:00:48,138
It's who you are,
you can't help yourself.

15
00:00:48,972 --> 00:00:51,725
Okay. Anyway, check this out.
Know what that is?

16
00:00:52,434 --> 00:00:56,604
- A two megapixel, full-color webcam.
- Right.

17
00:00:56,771 --> 00:00:59,149
How do I do it?

18
00:00:59,357 --> 00:01:02,569
I got one for me and for Jake.
We can hook them to our computers...

19
00:01:02,736 --> 00:01:05,447
so when he's at his mother's,
we can have video chats.

20
00:01:05,613 --> 00:01:06,865
- That's cool.
- Isn't it?

21
00:01:07,032 --> 00:01:10,702
Yeah, with a couple of these, phone sex
becomes less phone and more sex.

22
00:01:11,411 --> 00:01:13,705
These are to maintain
my relationship with Jake.

23
00:01:13,872 --> 00:01:15,540
It's the worst part of the divorce:

24
00:01:15,707 --> 00:01:18,376
- Only seeing him on weekends.
- I get that. I sympathize.

25
00:01:18,543 --> 00:01:21,421
But you can see the validity
of my vision too, right?

26
00:01:22,422 --> 00:01:26,968
Oh, look. Built-in microphone.
Totally hands-free. Perfect.

27
00:01:28,136 --> 00:01:30,972
- Excuse me.
- Oh, hey, Gail. Good to see you again.

28
00:01:31,139 --> 00:01:32,932
Don't move, don't talk.

29
00:01:33,933 --> 00:01:36,686
- Are you Charlie Harper?
- Yeah. Why?

30
00:01:36,853 --> 00:01:40,023
You were right. It's him.

31
00:01:42,901 --> 00:01:44,694
What...? What...? What's funny?

32
00:01:44,861 --> 00:01:46,654
Nothing.

33
00:01:48,490 --> 00:01:50,325
So listen, can I buy you a drink?

34
00:01:52,744 --> 00:01:54,788
He wants to buy me a drink.

35
00:01:56,498 --> 00:01:58,792
Then what? We go back
to your beach house...

36
00:01:58,958 --> 00:02:03,088
sit on the deck, look at the stars, talk
about how you love being an uncle...

37
00:02:03,254 --> 00:02:05,465
and how you'd
like kids of your own...

38
00:02:05,632 --> 00:02:08,968
and by the way, I have the
most beautiful eyes in the world.

39
00:02:09,177 --> 00:02:11,805
I'm sorry. Have we met before?

40
00:02:12,514 --> 00:02:15,058
No. And we're not gonna meet now.

41
00:02:17,644 --> 00:02:21,481
Okay. I have a bad feeling.

42
00:02:30,856 --> 00:02:32,942
Is the camera on?

43
00:02:33,234 --> 00:02:35,361
Good. Now, hit "connect."

44
00:02:35,569 --> 00:02:38,322
I can see you. Can you see me?

45
00:02:39,365 --> 00:02:42,284
Yeah, yeah. I can hear you too.
You can hang up the phone.

46
00:02:42,451 --> 00:02:44,119
This is awesome.

47
00:02:44,286 --> 00:02:47,373
- Yeah, we can see each other every day.
- Cool.

48
00:02:51,919 --> 00:02:53,546
So...

49
00:02:54,296 --> 00:02:55,673
What's new?

50
00:02:55,839 --> 00:02:57,424
Nothing.

51
00:03:00,427 --> 00:03:02,555
What's new with you?

52
00:03:04,723 --> 00:03:06,392
Not much.

53
00:03:15,651 --> 00:03:18,946
- Hey, Charlie.
- Rose, stop.

54
00:03:19,488 --> 00:03:21,865
- What?
- We're friends now, right?

55
00:03:22,366 --> 00:03:23,450
Right.

56
00:03:23,617 --> 00:03:27,454
Our one-night stand is ancient history.
You're not stalking me anymore, right?

57
00:03:27,621 --> 00:03:31,166
- Right.
- Then use the damn stairs.

58
00:03:31,375 --> 00:03:33,669
- Really?
- Yes.

59
00:03:33,836 --> 00:03:35,421
Okay.

60
00:03:39,883 --> 00:03:43,929
- I'm opening up the gate.
- I'm proud of you.

61
00:03:44,096 --> 00:03:47,808
- I'm starting up the stairs.
- You can do it.

62
00:03:49,643 --> 00:03:51,395
Oh, boy.

63
00:03:51,562 --> 00:03:54,106
I don't know about this.

64
00:03:54,815 --> 00:03:56,942
- You'll get used to it.
- Yeah, we'll see.

65
00:03:59,903 --> 00:04:01,905
I'm surprised to see you home.

66
00:04:02,072 --> 00:04:04,616
- It's ladies' night at Pavlov's.
- I know.

67
00:04:04,783 --> 00:04:08,454
Well, isn't that kind of like
rabbit season for Elmer Fudd?

68
00:04:08,912 --> 00:04:10,372
Used to be.

69
00:04:10,539 --> 00:04:12,166
Let me ask you question.

70
00:04:12,499 --> 00:04:15,210
How much do chicks talk
about men they've been with?

71
00:04:15,669 --> 00:04:17,129
Not as much as you'd think.

72
00:04:17,337 --> 00:04:19,757
- Really?
- Way more.

73
00:04:20,883 --> 00:04:23,594
- Why?
- Well, I ran into some women last night.

74
00:04:23,761 --> 00:04:25,095
Never met them before.

75
00:04:25,262 --> 00:04:28,057
But they seem to have already formed
a poor opinion of me.

76
00:04:28,599 --> 00:04:31,518
So you think somebody's out there
spreading nasty rumors?

77
00:04:31,685 --> 00:04:35,564
Worse. I think somebody's out there
spreading the truth.

78
00:04:35,773 --> 00:04:38,484
Well, you have burned
a few bridges in this town.

79
00:04:38,650 --> 00:04:42,863
Hey, I don't burn bridges.
I have casual sex with relative strangers.

80
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:44,907
There's a difference.

81
00:04:45,824 --> 00:04:47,242
And I'm always honest.

82
00:04:47,409 --> 00:04:52,122
I never lead a woman on.
Unless I'm, you know, totally bombed.

83
00:04:53,457 --> 00:04:57,711
Last night was probably the result
of one woman with an ax to grind.

84
00:04:57,878 --> 00:04:59,421
Probably.

85
00:04:59,588 --> 00:05:01,048
Yeah, that's it.

86
00:05:01,215 --> 00:05:04,426
- I'm making myself crazy over nothing.
- Oh, I do that all the time.

87
00:05:04,593 --> 00:05:06,970
It's a great way to fill up
a slow weekend.

88
00:05:08,597 --> 00:05:10,933
Rose, that night we spent together...

89
00:05:11,099 --> 00:05:13,018
did I tell you
you had beautiful eyes?

90
00:05:13,936 --> 00:05:17,981
Well, let's see. We had a couple
of drinks, you invited me back here.

91
00:05:18,148 --> 00:05:21,819
We were sitting out on the deck,
looking at the stars.

92
00:05:21,985 --> 00:05:23,821
And, yeah, you said:

93
00:05:23,987 --> 00:05:27,658
"By the way, you have
the most beautiful eyes in the world."

94
00:05:29,451 --> 00:05:31,453
I guess I do use that a lot.

95
00:05:32,412 --> 00:05:35,249
But, damn it, it's good.

96
00:05:36,083 --> 00:05:38,794
Are you sure it's not red?
Look again.

97
00:05:41,797 --> 00:05:46,260
It looks fine.
You have to go to school tomorrow.

98
00:05:46,468 --> 00:05:49,054
- Good night, Rose.
- Night, Charlie.

99
00:05:49,221 --> 00:05:51,473
And don't forget to use the...

100
00:05:52,766 --> 00:05:54,434
Never mind.

101
00:05:54,601 --> 00:05:56,103
Oh, Charlie, Charlie.
Come here.

102
00:05:56,270 --> 00:05:59,147
- Say hello to your Uncle Charlie.
- Hey, Uncle Charlie.

103
00:05:59,314 --> 00:06:01,733
- Hi, Jake.
- I can see you.

104
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:03,652
I can see you too.

105
00:06:04,444 --> 00:06:05,988
So...

106
00:06:06,488 --> 00:06:08,156
What's new?

107
00:06:08,323 --> 00:06:10,867
Not much.
What's new with you?

108
00:06:11,034 --> 00:06:12,786
Nothing. Oh, wait.
I Googled you...

109
00:06:12,953 --> 00:06:14,788
and you'll never guess
what I found.

110
00:06:14,955 --> 00:06:16,999
Jake, are you in the bathtub?

111
00:06:17,165 --> 00:06:18,667
Yeah. Gotta go.

112
00:06:18,834 --> 00:06:21,253
No, no, no. Wait, Jake,
what are you talking about?

113
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:23,255
- What's he talking about?
- I don't know.

114
00:06:23,422 --> 00:06:26,049
But if you Google me,
you'll find pages that mention...

115
00:06:26,216 --> 00:06:29,344
my San Fernando Valley
Chiropractor of the Year award.

116
00:06:29,595 --> 00:06:31,305
That's nice.
Get out of the way.

117
00:06:33,890 --> 00:06:36,893
Oh, careful. There's another
Alan J. Harper.

118
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:41,106
He's a school bus driver, and he also
makes these decorative pigs...

119
00:06:41,273 --> 00:06:43,942
out of bleach bottles
and pipe cleaners.

120
00:06:44,109 --> 00:06:46,528
I'm not Googling you.
I'm Googling me.

121
00:06:51,074 --> 00:06:53,493
"CharlieHarperSucks. Com."

122
00:06:54,786 --> 00:06:57,080
That's gotta be a different
Charlie Harper.

123
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:04,755
Okay.

124
00:07:04,921 --> 00:07:06,715
I have a bad feeling.

125
00:07:12,929 --> 00:07:14,473
Oh, boy.

126
00:07:15,015 --> 00:07:17,225
Oh, man.

127
00:07:17,434 --> 00:07:19,770
Oh, crap.

128
00:07:20,771 --> 00:07:23,565
- Are you still reading that thing?
- How can I not?

129
00:07:23,732 --> 00:07:26,610
It's an entire website
devoted to trashing me.

130
00:07:26,777 --> 00:07:28,111
Listen to this:

131
00:07:28,278 --> 00:07:32,199
"Has anybody had sex with Charlie
where he actually took his socks off?"

132
00:07:33,658 --> 00:07:36,286
That's just mean.
I have bad circulation in my feet.

133
00:07:36,453 --> 00:07:38,580
They get cold.

134
00:07:38,997 --> 00:07:43,210
Check this out. Some girl posted audio
off her answering machine.

135
00:07:45,295 --> 00:07:48,632
Hey, it's me. I just wanted to tell you
I had a great time last night.

136
00:07:48,799 --> 00:07:51,676
- And I'm looking forward...
- Hello, Charlie?

137
00:07:51,843 --> 00:07:53,762
Yeah, hi.

138
00:07:53,929 --> 00:07:56,306
We weren 't together last night.

139
00:07:57,849 --> 00:07:59,351
Allison?

140
00:07:59,518 --> 00:08:01,686
No, Beth.

141
00:08:01,853 --> 00:08:02,979
Thursday.

142
00:08:03,605 --> 00:08:07,400
I had a great time with you Thursday,
and I thought that may...

143
00:08:07,984 --> 00:08:10,487
Oh, Alan, what am I gonna do?

144
00:08:10,654 --> 00:08:12,989
Every woman in the city
can see this stuff.

145
00:08:13,156 --> 00:08:14,866
Every woman in the world.

146
00:08:15,075 --> 00:08:16,827
Oh, God.

147
00:08:16,993 --> 00:08:19,412
Well, you know what they say.

148
00:08:19,579 --> 00:08:21,915
Any publicity is...

149
00:08:22,082 --> 00:08:24,167
Good publicity.

150
00:08:24,376 --> 00:08:26,837
No, no, no.
What I do requires secrecy.

151
00:08:27,003 --> 00:08:30,382
I need shadows and darkness.
I'm like a magician.

152
00:08:30,549 --> 00:08:34,761
If everybody knows how I do it,
it ceases to be entertaining.

153
00:08:36,596 --> 00:08:38,390
"Frequently Asked Questions."

154
00:08:38,557 --> 00:08:40,100
- Don't read that.
- Yeah, right.

155
00:08:40,267 --> 00:08:42,519
Okay. Question:

156
00:08:42,727 --> 00:08:46,439
"How long can you expect to date
Charlie after you have sex with him?"

157
00:08:46,606 --> 00:08:49,609
Answer: " It depends how late
you sleep the next morning."

158
00:08:51,152 --> 00:08:54,823
Oh, come on. This is funny.
You're just too close to it.

159
00:08:56,157 --> 00:08:58,451
This could be interesting. Question:

160
00:08:58,618 --> 00:09:01,538
"How does Charlie manage
to fake my orgasm?"

161
00:09:01,705 --> 00:09:03,999
All right, stop it. Move over.

162
00:09:04,165 --> 00:09:06,376
- What are you doing?
- I've gotta fight back.

163
00:09:06,543 --> 00:09:08,920
Anybody can post on the message board.
Why not me?

164
00:09:09,087 --> 00:09:11,590
- You're gonna post as yourself?
- Don't be ridiculous.

165
00:09:11,756 --> 00:09:13,550
Everybody uses a screen name.

166
00:09:13,758 --> 00:09:16,887
"CharlieFreak219."

167
00:09:17,053 --> 00:09:18,805
Too many?

168
00:09:19,055 --> 00:09:20,765
Okay.

169
00:09:21,308 --> 00:09:23,310
CharlieFreak180.

170
00:09:27,022 --> 00:09:29,316
"In my experience...

171
00:09:30,025 --> 00:09:33,737
Charlie has always been...

172
00:09:33,903 --> 00:09:36,531
a generous lover...

173
00:09:36,698 --> 00:09:40,785
compassionate, fun-Ioving
and sensitive."

174
00:09:40,952 --> 00:09:44,581
There. That ought to bring
a little balance to the conversation.

175
00:09:44,748 --> 00:09:47,542
You really don't get the Internet,
do you?

176
00:09:49,377 --> 00:09:52,380
Oh, look. I've got a response already.

177
00:09:52,547 --> 00:09:56,134
"Dear Freak: Are you just stupid...

178
00:09:56,301 --> 00:10:00,180
or did your skull bounce off
his headboard too many times?"

179
00:10:00,347 --> 00:10:02,557
Okay, I've had enough of this.

180
00:10:02,724 --> 00:10:06,269
- How do I delete this whole thing?
- You can't delete a website.

181
00:10:06,436 --> 00:10:08,438
Only the person who created it can.

182
00:10:08,605 --> 00:10:12,108
- Well, how do I find out who created it?
- Now, let's see. Come on.

183
00:10:12,275 --> 00:10:14,402
Okay.

184
00:10:15,236 --> 00:10:19,407
Okay, the domain is the property of a
company in the Cayman Islands called:

185
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:23,661
"Charlie Harper Sucks Limited."

186
00:10:24,496 --> 00:10:25,830
Well, that's no help.

187
00:10:26,331 --> 00:10:28,666
Hey, you can buy T-shirts
and coffee mugs.

188
00:10:29,876 --> 00:10:32,379
"Add to cart."

189
00:10:39,469 --> 00:10:42,180
No, Mom, it is not that simple.

190
00:10:42,347 --> 00:10:45,683
I am a single mother now.
Dating is very complicated.

191
00:10:46,935 --> 00:10:48,728
I understand.

192
00:10:48,895 --> 00:10:51,231
No, I can 't go back to Alan.

193
00:10:51,398 --> 00:10:53,066
Of course I still love him.

194
00:10:54,401 --> 00:10:56,027
Hey, Alan?

195
00:10:56,194 --> 00:10:58,655
How long you think this Internet fad
is gonna last?

196
00:10:59,155 --> 00:11:00,532
- Okay.
- What?

197
00:11:01,032 --> 00:11:03,993
Jake must've turned on his webcam
before he went to school.

198
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:08,206
I can see and hear Judith
talking to her mother on the phone.

199
00:11:08,373 --> 00:11:10,667
- Why can't she hear us?
- Our side's turned off.

200
00:11:10,834 --> 00:11:13,837
Are you kidding? Alan would never
take me back. How do I know?

201
00:11:14,003 --> 00:11:15,713
I just know.

202
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:17,590
Okay, fine. I'll ask him.

203
00:11:18,716 --> 00:11:20,844
- She wants me back.
- Yes, I will ask him.

204
00:11:21,010 --> 00:11:22,595
That's nice. It's all about you.

205
00:11:22,762 --> 00:11:24,180
Okay.

206
00:11:24,347 --> 00:11:26,474
Listen, Mom, I gotta get in the shower.

207
00:11:27,142 --> 00:11:28,935
I got it. Yes.

208
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:33,815
All right. I'll call you later.

209
00:11:36,401 --> 00:11:38,486
Oh, man.

210
00:11:39,696 --> 00:11:43,533
- Charlie, I need to talk about this.
- Me too.

211
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:45,827
If I don't do something
about that website...

212
00:11:45,994 --> 00:11:48,037
I'm gonna have to chase
Amish broads.

213
00:11:48,371 --> 00:11:50,874
Judith wants to reconcile.
I've dreamed about this...

214
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:53,751
but now that it's here,
I wonder if it's what I want.

215
00:11:53,918 --> 00:11:57,672
Whoever put up that site has to be
somebody I went out with at least once.

216
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:00,758
It would be great for Jake
to have both parents in one house.

217
00:12:00,925 --> 00:12:04,762
And without alimony, I could stop
getting my hair cut at the barber college.

218
00:12:04,929 --> 00:12:08,141
I can eliminate married chicks,
ones that don't speak English...

219
00:12:08,308 --> 00:12:10,852
and those to whom
I was never properly introduced.

220
00:12:11,019 --> 00:12:13,813
I'll make a list of the pros and cons
of going back to her.

221
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:16,566
You know what?
I'm gonna need to make a list.

222
00:12:16,983 --> 00:12:19,235
- I'm glad we talked.
- I'm always here for you.

223
00:12:19,402 --> 00:12:20,904
Me too.

224
00:12:37,143 --> 00:12:39,479
Hi, Tina. Long time, huh?

225
00:12:39,646 --> 00:12:42,815
Charlie Harper. What do you want?

226
00:12:44,234 --> 00:12:46,819
I know things didn't end well
between us, and...

227
00:12:46,986 --> 00:12:48,988
Really? I thought they ended perfectly.

228
00:12:49,155 --> 00:12:52,700
We spent a week in Cancún,
having great sex every day.

229
00:12:52,867 --> 00:12:56,246
Flew back to L.A. You told me you'd
call me tomorrow, and it's been...

230
00:12:56,412 --> 00:12:58,748
What do you know?
A year and a half.

231
00:12:59,666 --> 00:13:01,709
- That long?
- Oh, yeah.

232
00:13:01,876 --> 00:13:04,963
I guess time flies when
you're the scum of the earth.

233
00:13:05,588 --> 00:13:07,048
Okay, I had that coming.

234
00:13:08,341 --> 00:13:12,804
I was thoughtless and insensitive, and I
know I can never really make up for it...

235
00:13:12,971 --> 00:13:19,560
but I want you to know that I was
wrong, and I'm really, truly sorry.

236
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:23,189
- And...?
- No "and."

237
00:13:23,356 --> 00:13:27,026
I just wanted to apologize for
being a jerk. I wanna make amends.

238
00:13:27,735 --> 00:13:30,571
- You really mean that, don't you?
- I do. Absolutely.

239
00:13:32,490 --> 00:13:36,703
- You wanna come in for a cup of coffee?
- Sure, I guess.

240
00:13:37,578 --> 00:13:40,289
So, seeing anybody?

241
00:13:46,421 --> 00:13:51,134
"Pro: No alimony. Con: No sex."

242
00:13:52,635 --> 00:13:56,681
"Pro: See Jake all the time.
Con: See Judith all the time."

243
00:13:56,848 --> 00:13:58,433
What are you doing? Give me that.

244
00:13:58,599 --> 00:14:01,144
- I'm sorry. It was just laying there.
- That's private.

245
00:14:01,310 --> 00:14:02,854
Okay.

246
00:14:08,109 --> 00:14:10,778
I got another "pro" for you.

247
00:14:11,362 --> 00:14:14,115
- Yeah? What's that?
- lf you hook back up with Olive Oyl...

248
00:14:14,282 --> 00:14:16,993
I won't have to scrub your toilet
anymore.

249
00:14:18,119 --> 00:14:22,874
Pro: No more Berta.

250
00:14:23,499 --> 00:14:26,002
You're not really thinking about
going back, are you?

251
00:14:26,169 --> 00:14:28,463
I don't know.
She wants to, but I'm torn.

252
00:14:28,629 --> 00:14:30,715
You're not torn. You're gutless.

253
00:14:32,759 --> 00:14:34,677
- Do you still love her?
- Of course I do.

254
00:14:34,844 --> 00:14:38,431
I mean, you know, we've been though
a lot of things together.

255
00:14:38,598 --> 00:14:42,894
- She's the mother of my son.
- Okay, listen to me, Zippy.

256
00:14:43,269 --> 00:14:45,271
If that's all it took
to make a marriage...

257
00:14:45,438 --> 00:14:47,565
I'd have a husband
for each of my tattoos.

258
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:51,402
- You have tattoos?
- Yeah. You wanna see them?

259
00:14:53,404 --> 00:14:54,739
No.

260
00:14:55,156 --> 00:14:58,701
You're overthinking this. When your
dog dies, you don't make a list.

261
00:14:58,868 --> 00:15:00,661
You bury him, plant a shrub on top...

262
00:15:00,828 --> 00:15:04,165
tell the kids he's running around
a farm, and move on.

263
00:15:05,917 --> 00:15:08,085
That's actually a very apt metaphor.

264
00:15:08,252 --> 00:15:11,631
My failed marriage is like a dead dog.

265
00:15:11,798 --> 00:15:15,968
But it serves as fertilizer for the shrub,
which represents my new life.

266
00:15:16,177 --> 00:15:20,139
So if I try to revitalize the marriage...
You know, digging up the dog.

267
00:15:20,306 --> 00:15:23,059
- then I'm killing the shrub,
which is me.

268
00:15:24,185 --> 00:15:25,853
Like you said, it's apt.

269
00:15:28,147 --> 00:15:30,650
Thank you, Berta.
You're a very insightful woman.

270
00:15:30,816 --> 00:15:34,028
I know. In a just world,
you'd be washing my shorts.

271
00:15:35,112 --> 00:15:37,823
Well, thanks, nevertheless.

272
00:15:37,990 --> 00:15:41,077
Last chance to see those tattoos.

273
00:15:41,786 --> 00:15:43,204
No thanks.

274
00:15:43,371 --> 00:15:46,791
I can make the Road Runner
do jumping jacks.

275
00:15:50,461 --> 00:15:52,964
That was a fun apology.

276
00:15:53,714 --> 00:15:57,260
Yeah, I really thought
I was the one who deserved a spanking.

277
00:15:58,177 --> 00:16:00,721
- So you'll call me?
- Count on it.

278
00:16:01,806 --> 00:16:05,059
Hey, not that I really care, but,
do you happen to know...

279
00:16:05,268 --> 00:16:07,061
who started that silly website?

280
00:16:07,228 --> 00:16:09,230
No. I just found it
by Googling your name.

281
00:16:09,397 --> 00:16:12,066
Most women Google
the guys they go out with, you know.

282
00:16:12,233 --> 00:16:14,151
Yeah, I've heard.

283
00:16:15,069 --> 00:16:18,698
- Well, I'll see you soon.
- You better.

284
00:16:20,866 --> 00:16:23,619
Okay. That went well.

285
00:16:26,789 --> 00:16:30,251
Let's see. Who's next?

286
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:22,928
Jake, why don't you go watch
some TV. I need to talk to your dad.

287
00:17:23,095 --> 00:17:26,599
Is this about the firecrackers?
What firecrackers?

288
00:17:26,766 --> 00:17:29,852
I'll go watch TV.

289
00:17:31,604 --> 00:17:33,064
Come in, sit down.

290
00:17:33,230 --> 00:17:35,649
Thanks. Listen...

291
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:39,153
- Boy, this is tough.
- Okay, okay, maybe...

292
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:41,781
I can make it easier for you.

293
00:17:41,947 --> 00:17:43,491
Judith...

294
00:17:44,075 --> 00:17:46,243
I will always love you...

295
00:17:47,995 --> 00:17:50,039
but there's no going back for me.

296
00:17:50,206 --> 00:17:53,626
I've learned a lot about myself
in the last year, and I'm growing.

297
00:17:53,793 --> 00:17:56,420
And... And I wanna keep on growing.

298
00:17:57,797 --> 00:18:01,383
I will always cherish
what we had...

299
00:18:02,218 --> 00:18:04,303
but I have to fertilize my shrub.

300
00:18:06,722 --> 00:18:09,558
- What are you talking about?
- It's Berta's metaphor.

301
00:18:09,725 --> 00:18:13,312
The... The bottom line is:
I don't want to reconcile.

302
00:18:13,479 --> 00:18:15,231
Our marriage is over.

303
00:18:15,397 --> 00:18:17,775
Well, what makes you think
I wanna reconcile?

304
00:18:18,609 --> 00:18:20,653
What did you wanna talk to me about?

305
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:24,365
My mom wanted me to ask
if Jake could spend a couple of weeks...

306
00:18:24,532 --> 00:18:26,367
with them this summer.
- Oh, really?

307
00:18:26,534 --> 00:18:29,203
- That's what she wanted you to ask me?
- Yes.

308
00:18:29,411 --> 00:18:31,914
You didn't tell her you loved me,
you missed me?

309
00:18:32,081 --> 00:18:34,625
Well, I always tell her that
to shut her up.

310
00:18:36,001 --> 00:18:39,046
And how the hell do you know
what I talk to my mother about?

311
00:18:41,966 --> 00:18:44,969
Hey, look, Charlie's here.

312
00:18:51,767 --> 00:18:54,853
- Answer my question, Alan.
- Hold on a second, Judith.

313
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:58,983
- Charlie, what's wrong?
- I've been making amends.

314
00:18:59,608 --> 00:19:01,777
Five amends in one afternoon.

315
00:19:01,944 --> 00:19:06,323
Well, technically, four.
I had to fake the last one.

316
00:19:08,284 --> 00:19:10,869
- Charlie, Alan and I are talking.
- Don't worry.

317
00:19:11,036 --> 00:19:13,789
I'll be out of your way as soon
as I check on something.

318
00:19:13,956 --> 00:19:15,749
They all denied
running the website...

319
00:19:15,916 --> 00:19:19,169
but at least I should have
some good reviews now.

320
00:19:20,296 --> 00:19:21,630
Listen to this:

321
00:19:21,797 --> 00:19:25,384
"Charlie came over and apologized today,
and, oh, what an apology it was.

322
00:19:25,551 --> 00:19:28,053
I take back everything nasty
I ever said about him."

323
00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:30,055
Not bad, huh?

324
00:19:31,015 --> 00:19:32,224
Here's another one:

325
00:19:36,061 --> 00:19:37,521
"He apologized to you today?

326
00:19:37,688 --> 00:19:40,607
He apologized to me too."

327
00:19:40,774 --> 00:19:44,153
Okay, I have a bad feeling again.

328
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:46,530
Alan, how do you know what
I said to my mother?

329
00:19:48,866 --> 00:19:52,411
I didn't actually know.
I surmised.

330
00:19:52,578 --> 00:19:54,246
I should go talk to Charlie.

331
00:19:54,413 --> 00:19:57,666
Hey, Dad, check it out.
I can see my room on your computer.

332
00:20:00,294 --> 00:20:04,089
Okay, now I've got a bad feeling.

333
00:20:12,293 --> 00:20:14,587
My heart was in the right place, Rose.

334
00:20:14,754 --> 00:20:17,465
- I know.
- All I wanted to do was apologize.

335
00:20:17,632 --> 00:20:20,301
- I had no ulterior motives.
- I believe you.

336
00:20:20,468 --> 00:20:22,136
Thank you.

337
00:20:24,138 --> 00:20:25,473
Did I ever apologize to you?

00:20:26,474 --> 00:20:30,728
You mean, for our one-night stand
that kind of, sort of broke my heart?

339
00:20:32,397 --> 00:20:33,731
Yeah, for that.

340
00:20:35,108 --> 00:20:36,609
No, not really.

341
00:20:37,819 --> 00:20:41,155
Okay, well, I am truly sorry.

342
00:20:41,322 --> 00:20:43,866
You're a wonderful person,
and you deserved better.

00:20:44,575 --> 00:20:46,452
Thank you, Charlie.

344
00:20:46,619 --> 00:20:49,414

- Oh, this?

It's one of those new
web browser, e-mail gadgets.

Cool.
