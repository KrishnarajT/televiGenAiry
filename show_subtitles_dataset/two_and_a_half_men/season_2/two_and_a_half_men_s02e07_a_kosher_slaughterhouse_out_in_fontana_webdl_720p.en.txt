1
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:06,892
- Hey, look who's here.
- Hey, Dad.

2
00:00:07,067 --> 00:00:08,649
Aren't you gonna kiss me goodbye?

3
00:00:08,823 --> 00:00:10,869
Apparently not.

4
00:00:13,424 --> 00:00:15,089
Do you see how rude he is to me?

5
00:00:15,306 --> 00:00:16,971
It's terrible. I'll talk to him.

6
00:00:17,146 --> 00:00:21,072
- I wish you would because... Wait, Alan!
- Oh, oh, sorry.

7
00:00:21,287 --> 00:00:23,868
Alan, have you been badmouthing me?

8
00:00:24,549 --> 00:00:28,260
- Badmouthing you? To whom?
- To Jake.

9
00:00:28,481 --> 00:00:30,146
Oh, to Jake. No.

10
00:00:32,998 --> 00:00:36,127
- Why?
- His attitude towards me is disrespectful.

11
00:00:36,302 --> 00:00:38,550
I have to wonder
where he's getting it from.

12
00:00:38,728 --> 00:00:42,487
I assure you, I make it a point
to speak well of you in front of our son.

13
00:00:42,869 --> 00:00:44,284
What about your brother?

14
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:46,712
Oh, with Charlie,
I'm completely honest.

15
00:00:47,679 --> 00:00:49,058
That is not what I meant.

16
00:00:49,519 --> 00:00:51,398
I know.

17
00:00:52,112 --> 00:00:53,659
Hey, Judith.

18
00:00:53,827 --> 00:00:56,408
Have you said derogatory things
about me to Jake?

19
00:00:56,629 --> 00:00:59,210
No, why? Did you want me to?

20
00:01:01,941 --> 00:01:03,523
I don't understand his behavior.

21
00:01:03,698 --> 00:01:06,873
Ignoring me, avoiding me,
acting like I'm the enemy.

22
00:01:07,085 --> 00:01:09,583
But you get why I'm doing it, right?

23
00:01:11,895 --> 00:01:13,227
I got it!

24
00:01:13,401 --> 00:01:16,078
I don't know what to say.
He's not getting it from us.

25
00:01:16,245 --> 00:01:18,577
- Absolutely not.
- It's your mother!

26
00:01:18,755 --> 00:01:20,883
- You talk to her.
- No, I talked last time.

27
00:01:21,097 --> 00:01:22,560
- Choose you for it.
- Odds.

28
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:23,852
One, two, three, shoot.

29
00:01:24,025 --> 00:01:25,523
- Odds. You talk to her.
- No.

30
00:01:25,739 --> 00:01:27,868
- Hey, but you said you were gonna...
- I lied.

31
00:01:30,047 --> 00:01:33,223
Leave a message at the beep. Beep!

32
00:01:39,918 --> 00:01:42,213
I wish there were a better way
to deal with Mom.

33
00:01:42,427 --> 00:01:45,603
There is, but we're both
too pretty for jail.

34
00:01:52,424 --> 00:01:54,220
- What?
- What?

35
00:02:22,663 --> 00:02:24,459
Mom's here.

36
00:02:24,629 --> 00:02:26,044
Charlie, did you hear me?

37
00:02:26,218 --> 00:02:29,513
Yeah, I just prefer to live in denial.

38
00:02:30,108 --> 00:02:31,571
Come on.

39
00:02:31,739 --> 00:02:34,201
We talked about this.
We need to set an example.

40
00:02:34,709 --> 00:02:39,098
Fine, tell Mom I love her and...
I don't wanna give her my cold.

41
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:41,023
That is not going to help.

42
00:02:41,233 --> 00:02:43,696
Well, you gotta say it in front of Jake.

43
00:02:44,579 --> 00:02:46,542
No. Here is the plan.

44
00:02:46,712 --> 00:02:49,127
We'll stop acting
like we hate being with her...

45
00:02:49,306 --> 00:02:53,397
stop taking shots at her, and start
acting like we love and respect her.

46
00:02:54,115 --> 00:02:57,125
- All at once?
- Come on.

47
00:02:57,754 --> 00:02:59,883
Your Uncle Charlie thinks
I don't see him...

48
00:03:00,598 --> 00:03:03,608
but Grandmommy sees everything.

49
00:03:03,819 --> 00:03:05,901
Mom, we didn't expect
to see you today.

50
00:03:06,119 --> 00:03:08,748
I have to come unannounced
because when I call first...

51
00:03:08,921 --> 00:03:11,634
there's no one home
when I get here.

52
00:03:12,644 --> 00:03:16,783
I imagine that's only because
my cowardly sons are trying to avoid me.

53
00:03:16,994 --> 00:03:19,158
She's ruining the plan.

54
00:03:19,336 --> 00:03:22,929
Well, the important thing is we're
all here, and we're happy to see you.

55
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:26,895
- Right, Charlie?
- Oh, happy isn't the word.

56
00:03:27,073 --> 00:03:30,499
- So, what's new, Mom?
- Well, if you really care...

57
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:33,680
- We do, we do.
- We do.

58
00:03:33,891 --> 00:03:37,234
Next Sunday,
I am receiving my gold blazer...

59
00:03:37,446 --> 00:03:39,528
from the
Westside Realtor's Association.

60
00:03:39,746 --> 00:03:41,625
- I am so proud of you.
- That's great.

61
00:03:41,796 --> 00:03:43,592
Me too, Mom.

62
00:03:43,803 --> 00:03:46,682
It's the highest honor
the real-estate community can bestow.

63
00:03:47,526 --> 00:03:49,358
- I am so proud of you.
- That's great.

64
00:03:49,533 --> 00:03:51,282
Me too, Mom.

65
00:03:52,587 --> 00:03:55,881
So I wanted to talk to you
about the presentation ceremony.

66
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:58,063
We'll be there.
Tell us where and when.

67
00:03:58,275 --> 00:04:01,700
Well, next Sunday, 5:00.
And I was hoping we could have it here.

68
00:04:02,625 --> 00:04:03,957
- Here?
- Why here?

69
00:04:04,130 --> 00:04:07,556
- I mean, we love and respect you...
- But why here?

70
00:04:09,777 --> 00:04:11,989
This isn't really
a good house for parties.

71
00:04:12,161 --> 00:04:15,123
- Yeah, it's so big and close to the ocean.
- Yeah.

72
00:04:16,427 --> 00:04:19,007
Come on. I can't very well
throw a party for myself.

73
00:04:19,187 --> 00:04:22,863
This way everyone will get to see
how much my sons love and respect me.

74
00:04:24,792 --> 00:04:28,135
Anyway, here is the guest list,
and also a suggested menu.

75
00:04:28,347 --> 00:04:31,226
Nothing fancy. Cocktails, buffet.

76
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:33,197
Any questions?

77
00:04:36,294 --> 00:04:38,256
- No.
- Good.

78
00:04:39,347 --> 00:04:41,429
Okay.

79
00:04:41,856 --> 00:04:44,866
Big kiss. Love you all.

80
00:04:45,913 --> 00:04:48,209
- Love you too, Mom.
- Bye, Grandma.

81
00:04:48,632 --> 00:04:49,964
Relatives, huh?

82
00:04:50,138 --> 00:04:53,516
Can't live with them,
can't turn them in for the reward.

83
00:04:53,735 --> 00:04:57,494
Excuse me, Berta, but we happen
to love our mother very much.

84
00:04:57,666 --> 00:04:59,498
- Right, Charlie?
- Right.

85
00:04:59,674 --> 00:05:01,672
Jake, look.
There's a pelican on the deck.

86
00:05:01,891 --> 00:05:03,056
Oh, cool.

87
00:05:08,499 --> 00:05:11,425
Are you happy?

88
00:05:12,012 --> 00:05:14,891
Now we have to throw a party
for your crazy-ass mother.

89
00:05:15,107 --> 00:05:17,022
- She's your mother too.
- How do you know?

90
00:05:17,198 --> 00:05:18,863
- I could've been adopted.
- You wish.

91
00:05:19,081 --> 00:05:23,089
I do. Now, what about
this stupid party?

92
00:05:23,305 --> 00:05:25,637
Here. Maybe this'll help.

93
00:05:29,077 --> 00:05:31,456
"Daisy's Fishing Tackle and Live Bait"?

94
00:05:32,088 --> 00:05:34,086
Turn it over.

95
00:05:34,263 --> 00:05:36,677
"Daisy's Classy Catering."

96
00:05:37,525 --> 00:05:41,070
She's my sister. Her husband left.
I'm trying to get her back on her feet.

97
00:05:41,290 --> 00:05:44,002
She runs a catering business
and a bait shop?

98
00:05:44,217 --> 00:05:46,049
Not at the same time.

99
00:05:48,944 --> 00:05:51,572
There's no pelican.

100
00:05:57,309 --> 00:05:59,937
Hey, you Charlie?

101
00:06:04,210 --> 00:06:06,006
Maybe.

102
00:06:07,932 --> 00:06:11,393
- Who's asking?
- I'm Daisy, the caterer.

103
00:06:13,035 --> 00:06:14,414
Your Berta's sister?

104
00:06:14,624 --> 00:06:16,837
Same mom. Dad's a little iffy.

105
00:06:18,388 --> 00:06:21,683
Berta said if I wanted a shot
of your bourbon, I had to ask you.

106
00:06:22,654 --> 00:06:25,664
- Yeah, sure. Knock yourself out.
- Thanks.

107
00:06:28,426 --> 00:06:32,650
I don't usually drink before noon,
but I'm going through a rough patch.

108
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:36,119
Well, that's why they make bourbon.

109
00:06:36,331 --> 00:06:39,340
My husband left me for another woman.
You know how I found out?

110
00:06:39,552 --> 00:06:42,764
- To tell you the truth...
- Relax. It's rhetorical.

111
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:46,282
They waved to me as they drove
my house out of the trailer park.

112
00:06:48,502 --> 00:06:50,299
- That's sad.
- Yeah.

113
00:06:50,468 --> 00:06:53,394
I had that doublewide 11 years.

114
00:06:54,483 --> 00:06:55,946
Larry was with me for four.

115
00:06:56,114 --> 00:06:59,790
Six months of those were house arrest,
so you can't give him credit for that.

116
00:07:01,259 --> 00:07:04,518
You know,
I haven't gotten up to pee yet.

117
00:07:04,730 --> 00:07:06,859
Let me tell you something.

118
00:07:08,955 --> 00:07:11,833
Larry was nothing when I met him.

119
00:07:12,593 --> 00:07:15,603
He was working at some kosher
slaughterhouse out in Fontana...

120
00:07:15,772 --> 00:07:19,615
before they fired him
for being mean to the cattle.

121
00:07:20,582 --> 00:07:21,997
What?

122
00:07:22,548 --> 00:07:25,891
The Jewish laws dictate that
the animals have to be treated kindly...

123
00:07:26,061 --> 00:07:27,476
before they get whacked.

124
00:07:27,650 --> 00:07:29,197
Larry would taunt them.

125
00:07:29,365 --> 00:07:32,458
"Hey, hamburger,
guess what's gonna happen to you."

126
00:07:38,943 --> 00:07:41,786
Anyway, I picked him up off his sorry,
unemployed ass.

127
00:07:41,954 --> 00:07:44,833
I gave him hair plugs,
contact lenses, teeth.

128
00:07:46,304 --> 00:07:49,433
The bastard dumped me for this tiny,
little Korean manicurist...

129
00:07:49,608 --> 00:07:52,618
who huffs nail-polish remover
between appointments.

130
00:07:53,373 --> 00:07:57,632
Well, you give a guy hair and teeth,
he's bound to hook up with trash.

131
00:07:58,308 --> 00:08:00,187
No, she was pretty hot.

132
00:08:00,357 --> 00:08:03,486
She had a spray-on tan,
Botox up the yin-yang.

133
00:08:03,662 --> 00:08:05,910
Couldn't tell if she was 20 or 60.

134
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:10,849
- Daisy!
- In here!

135
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:15,956
What the hell are you doing?

136
00:08:16,167 --> 00:08:19,010
Relax. It's not what you think.
We're just having a drink.

137
00:08:19,179 --> 00:08:20,975
Good idea.

138
00:08:22,274 --> 00:08:24,902
You listen to me.
Just because I got us this job...

139
00:08:25,076 --> 00:08:27,039
doesn't mean
I'm cooking by myself.

140
00:08:27,209 --> 00:08:28,541
I'm coming down there.

141
00:08:28,715 --> 00:08:31,094
And don't act like you're doing me
some big favor.

142
00:08:31,266 --> 00:08:34,644
Oh, excuse me for trying to help
my broke, homeless, baby sister.

143
00:08:34,821 --> 00:08:38,616
I'm not homeless. I have a home.
I just don't know where it's parked.

144
00:08:38,795 --> 00:08:42,054
I wouldn't be broke if you'd have
paid me my share of Mama's estate.

145
00:08:42,266 --> 00:08:44,479
What estate? It was a shoebox...

146
00:08:44,650 --> 00:08:47,576
full of corn pads,
used lottery tickets and insulin.

147
00:08:47,787 --> 00:08:50,416
It's the first I'm hearing
about the insulin.

148
00:08:51,258 --> 00:08:53,304
Excuse me, but shouldn't we be,
you know...

149
00:08:53,475 --> 00:08:55,473
cooking something
for my mother's party?

150
00:08:56,152 --> 00:08:57,484
Hang on, Charlie.

151
00:08:57,658 --> 00:09:01,963
You know, I am sick of you insinuating
that I stole all that crap Mama left me.

152
00:09:02,175 --> 00:09:06,516
She didn't leave it to you. You were just
the first one back after she flatlined.

153
00:09:06,692 --> 00:09:09,320
Oh, and where were you?
At some ashram in Oregon?

154
00:09:09,494 --> 00:09:13,550
I was learning from my guru
how to channel my spirit guide.

155
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:17,305
Oh, please. You were humping
a defrocked priest in the woods.

156
00:09:20,954 --> 00:09:24,749
How about stuffed mushrooms?
Everybody loves those.

157
00:09:24,969 --> 00:09:27,264
You know, that's your problem
your whole life.

158
00:09:27,479 --> 00:09:30,357
You chase after losers,
take care of them, fix them up...

159
00:09:30,532 --> 00:09:33,375
and then they hop on
the first manicurist out of town.

160
00:09:33,543 --> 00:09:35,958
You're jealous because
I've had love in my life.

161
00:09:36,137 --> 00:09:39,229
Yeah? You know what you got
in your life now? Squat.

162
00:09:39,399 --> 00:09:43,074
No husband, no one to do your nails,
and blocks where your house used to be.

163
00:09:43,247 --> 00:09:46,625
I swear to God. One more word and
I'm gonna knock you on your keister!

164
00:09:46,802 --> 00:09:49,050
- Okay, okay, there's no reason...
- Squat!

165
00:09:49,228 --> 00:09:51,060
- That's it!
- Whoa, whoa, no!

166
00:09:51,235 --> 00:09:55,078
No, whoa! Stop! Berta!

167
00:09:56,798 --> 00:09:58,630
Berta!

168
00:10:07,714 --> 00:10:08,963
Give me the rolling pin.

169
00:10:09,847 --> 00:10:12,524
Is there a special place
you'd like me to put it?

170
00:10:14,155 --> 00:10:16,915
I don't know what else
you want from me. I took you in.

171
00:10:17,125 --> 00:10:19,587
Gunther's in the garage,
so you can have the couch.

172
00:10:19,802 --> 00:10:24,108
You spoil that dog.
Anyway, I'm staying at a motel tonight.

173
00:10:24,528 --> 00:10:28,584
Good idea. Maybe you'll meet
your next husband on the walk there.

174
00:10:28,794 --> 00:10:30,376
- Can I have one of these?
- No.

175
00:10:30,551 --> 00:10:33,263
I am just trying to be a good sister.

176
00:10:33,437 --> 00:10:35,732
No, you're trying
to make me feel like crap.

177
00:10:35,904 --> 00:10:37,486
It's what you always do.

178
00:10:38,037 --> 00:10:39,750
- So I can eat this?
- No.

179
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:42,461
- Let him have one.
- You don't know this kid.

180
00:10:42,638 --> 00:10:46,183
He never stops at one.
He eats like a refugee.

181
00:10:48,326 --> 00:10:50,325
- Eat it.
- Drop it.

182
00:10:52,802 --> 00:10:55,133
Hey, how's it going?

183
00:11:02,463 --> 00:11:04,211
Not good.

184
00:11:07,189 --> 00:11:08,902
Nice move, Tinkerbell.

185
00:11:09,113 --> 00:11:12,039
- Shut your hole and help me pick this up.
- You pick it up.

186
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:13,915
I'm going outside to meditate.

187
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:17,100
- What's going on?
- I'll tell you what's going on.

188
00:11:17,269 --> 00:11:19,482
You wanted that clown
to be nice to his mother.

189
00:11:19,653 --> 00:11:22,782
But did you think to say to him,
"Clown, be nice to your mother"?

190
00:11:22,957 --> 00:11:25,289
No, we had to throw a big party
for our mother...

191
00:11:25,467 --> 00:11:28,476
catered by
the Gorgeous Ladies of Wrestling.

192
00:11:29,566 --> 00:11:32,064
That's it. I can't work like this.

193
00:11:32,284 --> 00:11:33,664
Well, you have to, Berta.

194
00:11:33,832 --> 00:11:36,127
We've got 50 people coming
in a couple of hours.

195
00:11:36,341 --> 00:11:39,304
- Don't tell me. Tell her.
- Fine.

196
00:11:39,478 --> 00:11:40,512
Watch this.

197
00:11:43,744 --> 00:11:46,707
Hey! I'm meditating here!

198
00:11:48,805 --> 00:11:50,434
Jake, let's go pick up Grandma.

199
00:11:50,604 --> 00:11:53,184
- Charlie, you're in charge.
- The hell I am.

200
00:11:53,406 --> 00:11:55,404
- Why pick her up?
- Grandma likes to drink.

201
00:11:55,581 --> 00:11:59,542
- When grownups drink, they don't drive.
- Good thing Uncle Charlie lives here.

202
00:12:01,687 --> 00:12:04,185
So, good luck. I'll see you tomorrow.

203
00:12:04,406 --> 00:12:06,820
No, wait. Berta, you can't leave.

204
00:12:06,999 --> 00:12:11,721
Don't worry. Your deposit's fully
refundable in fishing tackle or live bait.

205
00:12:11,934 --> 00:12:13,266
I don't want a refund.

206
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,105
I want you to make up with Daisy...

207
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:19,159
so when my mother gets here, she'll
have something to eat besides my soul.

208
00:12:19,337 --> 00:12:22,882
Make up with her?
For what? Trying to help her?

209
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:25,985
Trying to keep her from making
the same stupid mistake again?

210
00:12:26,197 --> 00:12:28,492
Yeah, sure, fine, whatever. Just do it!

211
00:12:29,417 --> 00:12:31,165
No, I'm done with her. I quit.

212
00:12:31,592 --> 00:12:34,471
Berta... Berta, you can't quit being
related to somebody.

213
00:12:34,645 --> 00:12:35,847
Believe me, I've tried.

214
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:39,572
She is a spoiled, little princess...

215
00:12:39,748 --> 00:12:42,162
who doesn't know
when somebody's trying to help.

216
00:12:42,341 --> 00:12:44,339
- And you know what else?
- Hold on, hold on.

217
00:12:44,516 --> 00:12:48,109
I'm still trying to wrap
my brain around "little princess."

218
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:51,750
Ever since Mom spit her out,
she got everything she wanted.

219
00:12:51,961 --> 00:12:55,422
"We don't need to fix Berta's teeth,
Daisy needs singing lessons."

220
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,728
"Why spend money
on a prom dress for Berta...

221
00:12:57,900 --> 00:13:00,398
when Daisy needs tap shoes?"
- That's rough, but...

222
00:13:00,577 --> 00:13:02,956
"Who cares if Berta needs
her spine straightened?"

223
00:13:03,128 --> 00:13:04,626
"Daisy wants a nose job!"

224
00:13:05,805 --> 00:13:09,980
What if you went ahead and made
a couple dozen of those little egg rolls?

225
00:13:10,196 --> 00:13:12,694
"So what if Berta's got
an extra big toe?"

226
00:13:20,402 --> 00:13:22,947
- Mom?
- Oh, hello, boys.

227
00:13:23,664 --> 00:13:26,162
Why aren't you dressed?
We came to pick you up.

228
00:13:26,383 --> 00:13:28,179
So you can drink.

229
00:13:28,892 --> 00:13:32,687
Oh, yes, well,
I've decided to pass on the party.

230
00:13:32,907 --> 00:13:34,240
What? You can't pass.

231
00:13:34,413 --> 00:13:37,172
We've got people coming,
decorations, caterers.

232
00:13:37,383 --> 00:13:40,095
And that's how you're dressed?

233
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:42,351
Beats the hell out of a bathrobe.

234
00:13:44,158 --> 00:13:48,001
- Why don't you wanna go to your party?
- Please, it isn't a party.

235
00:13:48,173 --> 00:13:51,516
It's a sham.
None of those people are my friends.

236
00:13:52,021 --> 00:13:54,353
Why would you think that?

237
00:13:55,786 --> 00:13:59,330
Believe it or not, Alan, your mother is
a very sensitive woman...

238
00:13:59,508 --> 00:14:03,600
and I can feel when people around me
know that I hate them.

239
00:14:05,782 --> 00:14:08,244
Why did you want us
to throw the party?

240
00:14:08,459 --> 00:14:10,207
Oh, why does anyone want a party?

241
00:14:10,383 --> 00:14:12,428
To feel superior
while feigning humility.

242
00:14:12,641 --> 00:14:14,556
Don't touch that, Jake.

243
00:14:15,778 --> 00:14:17,193
Let me tell you something.

244
00:14:17,367 --> 00:14:20,912
The way you treat people
is the way they treat you back.

245
00:14:22,888 --> 00:14:25,303
Miserable bastards.

246
00:14:26,527 --> 00:14:30,702
But putting that aside,
you're getting a gold jacket today...

247
00:14:30,919 --> 00:14:32,964
and we wanted
to share that with you.

248
00:14:33,135 --> 00:14:38,275
Is that what it takes? I have to win an
award for my sons to notice I'm alive?

249
00:14:39,409 --> 00:14:43,668
Okay, you know what?
Go, don't go. I don't care.

250
00:14:43,884 --> 00:14:47,810
If you wanna sit here
and stew in the venom and bile...

251
00:14:47,983 --> 00:14:51,528
that is the soup of your being,
then fine. I hope you drown in it.

252
00:14:51,747 --> 00:14:54,626
Don't you ever talk
to your mother this way.

253
00:14:55,261 --> 00:14:58,056
Forget the party.
I'll go back and tell those people...

254
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:01,941
that the guest of honor could not
be bothered to show up.

255
00:15:02,162 --> 00:15:04,874
- Come on, Jake.
- Oh, dear Lord.

256
00:15:05,048 --> 00:15:07,593
Alan, wait.

257
00:15:08,059 --> 00:15:13,413
If this silly, little party
means that much to you, I'll go.

258
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:15,459
Just let me get dressed.

259
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:17,635
Oh, gee. Thanks, Mom.

260
00:15:21,025 --> 00:15:25,414
God, I hate being guilted
into doing things.

261
00:15:26,922 --> 00:15:30,348
And after all that, the loans,
the bail, the kidney I gave her...

262
00:15:30,519 --> 00:15:34,314
which even though it wasn't mine,
was still money out of pocket...

263
00:15:34,534 --> 00:15:36,532
did she appreciate my sacrifices?

264
00:15:37,169 --> 00:15:38,668
I'm guessing no.

265
00:15:38,884 --> 00:15:42,310
She threw them away on chasing
after men with drinking problems...

266
00:15:42,481 --> 00:15:45,693
men with gambling problems,
men with wooden legs and glass eyes.

267
00:15:45,869 --> 00:15:47,117
You wanna know why?

268
00:15:49,131 --> 00:15:51,213
Spare parts?

269
00:15:52,477 --> 00:15:54,024
Low self-esteem.

270
00:15:54,819 --> 00:15:56,651
I remember
when we were little girls...

271
00:15:56,827 --> 00:15:59,075
she had this crush
on our cousin Jimmy...

272
00:15:59,253 --> 00:16:03,214
- He wasn't really our cousin. He was...
- Stop, please! Enough.

273
00:16:04,272 --> 00:16:06,651
If you won't talk to her, I will.

274
00:16:08,036 --> 00:16:11,045
Finally. I was running out of stories.

275
00:16:12,804 --> 00:16:14,386
Daisy?

276
00:16:17,781 --> 00:16:19,363
Can I talk to you for a minute?

277
00:16:21,796 --> 00:16:24,972
Daisy is no longer inhabiting
this earthly vessel.

278
00:16:27,777 --> 00:16:29,110
Excuse me?

279
00:16:29,701 --> 00:16:33,412
I am Oxyquatzal,
warrior priestess of the Aztec people.

280
00:16:35,097 --> 00:16:36,429
Okay.

281
00:16:37,774 --> 00:16:39,403
Let me ask you something.

282
00:16:39,572 --> 00:16:43,165
Do you know how to make
those little hot dogs wrapped in pastry?

283
00:16:43,922 --> 00:16:46,502
Listen carefully.
I have a message for Daisy.

284
00:16:46,682 --> 00:16:49,359
- Really?
- She's wandered off the path of destiny.

285
00:16:49,526 --> 00:16:51,025
She must return.

286
00:16:51,659 --> 00:16:54,585
Alrighty, is there a number
where she can reach you?

287
00:16:55,047 --> 00:16:56,796
Tell her to follow her bliss...

288
00:16:56,971 --> 00:16:59,552
to stop squandering
the gifts of the Great Spirit.

289
00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:03,362
- Got it.
- Do you need to write that down?

290
00:17:04,583 --> 00:17:07,546
No, I got it. Path, bliss, spirit.

291
00:17:07,762 --> 00:17:11,307
- Great Spirit.
- Sorry. "Great Spirit."

292
00:17:11,484 --> 00:17:14,744
- Anything else?
- No, that's it.

293
00:17:21,271 --> 00:17:25,030
- What do you want?
- You're screwing with me, right?

294
00:17:25,245 --> 00:17:29,301
Get out of here.
I'm trying to channel my spirit guide.

295
00:17:29,511 --> 00:17:30,974
OxyContin?

296
00:17:32,773 --> 00:17:34,570
Oxyquatzal. How do
you know about her?

297
00:17:34,948 --> 00:17:36,232
Oh, boy.

298
00:17:36,454 --> 00:17:38,250
Berta!

299
00:17:39,716 --> 00:17:42,511
Was Oxyquatzal here?
What did she say?

300
00:17:44,735 --> 00:17:47,114
She said that the guests
are gonna be here soon...

301
00:17:47,287 --> 00:17:50,997
so you should make up
with your sister and finish cooking.

302
00:17:51,218 --> 00:17:52,847
No, she didn't.

303
00:17:53,058 --> 00:17:54,807
How do you know?

304
00:17:55,024 --> 00:17:59,164
Oxyquatzal is a 500-year-old
Aztec warrior.

305
00:17:59,332 --> 00:18:02,377
Do you think she really cares
about your dumb-ass party?

306
00:18:02,553 --> 00:18:05,051
Everybody likes a party.

307
00:18:05,606 --> 00:18:07,319
What did she really say, Chachi?

308
00:18:08,701 --> 00:18:13,376
She said that you have strayed from
your path and to follow your bliss...

309
00:18:13,553 --> 00:18:16,312
which is catering, right?
- No, I never liked catering.

310
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:20,073
I only got into it because the bait
business was so damn competitive.

311
00:18:20,788 --> 00:18:21,990
What else?

312
00:18:23,925 --> 00:18:27,601
Something about squandering
the gifts of the Great Spirit.

313
00:18:27,815 --> 00:18:31,110
Oh, man, that is heavy.

314
00:18:31,286 --> 00:18:34,962
For an ancient chick,
she is so spot on.

315
00:18:35,636 --> 00:18:38,598
Well, no sense crying over
squandered gifts.

316
00:18:38,773 --> 00:18:40,486
What do you say
we go to the kitchen?

317
00:18:40,655 --> 00:18:45,295
What's the point?
My life is hopeless. My dreams are dead.

318
00:18:45,465 --> 00:18:47,629
Yeah, but what if they weren't?

319
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:51,395
- What do you mean?
- Oh, I don't know.

320
00:18:51,571 --> 00:18:54,152
What if there was some way
I could help you?

321
00:18:54,834 --> 00:18:57,879
You think you could whip up
some rumaki then?

322
00:18:58,389 --> 00:19:00,518
You don't even know
what my dreams are.

323
00:19:00,731 --> 00:19:04,026
Oh, come on. Work with me, baby.
I don't even know what rumaki is!

324
00:19:06,796 --> 00:19:10,008
Oh, gosh, Alan,
I don't know about this.

325
00:19:10,225 --> 00:19:12,985
- Is my hair all right?
- Mom, your hair looks perfect.

326
00:19:13,153 --> 00:19:15,865
You're impeccably dressed,
you're fashionably late...

327
00:19:16,039 --> 00:19:17,871
and everybody is waiting for you.

328
00:19:18,047 --> 00:19:21,591
So, now, come on, let's walk in there
and rub their noses in your success.

329
00:19:21,811 --> 00:19:23,643
Well, all right.

330
00:19:24,279 --> 00:19:25,611
- Alan.
- What?

331
00:19:26,077 --> 00:19:27,956
You're blocking me.

332
00:19:59,286 --> 00:20:01,165
Rumaki?

333
00:20:03,719 --> 00:20:07,811
I will never, ever forgive you for this.

334
00:20:14,887 --> 00:20:19,026
One thing. One lousy thing I ask
from my sons, and this is what I get.

335
00:20:20,491 --> 00:20:22,156
- Sorry.
- Sorry.

336
00:20:22,666 --> 00:20:26,425
Not only was I roundly ignored
at my own party...

337
00:20:26,598 --> 00:20:29,096
but I listened
to a disturbed caterer belt out...

338
00:20:29,274 --> 00:20:31,403
the entire score
of La Cage aux Folles.

339
00:20:32,913 --> 00:20:34,197
- Sorry.
- Sorry.

340
00:20:34,419 --> 00:20:36,084
You should be sorry.

341
00:20:36,510 --> 00:20:37,842
We are.

342
00:20:38,058 --> 00:20:39,437
Then say it.

343
00:20:40,065 --> 00:20:42,194
- Sorry.
- Sorry.

344
00:20:42,408 --> 00:20:43,573
Hello?

345
00:20:44,206 --> 00:20:46,085
Jake, honey, ready to go home?

346
00:20:46,506 --> 00:20:50,682
Mom, you're here. I love you.

347
00:20:52,613 --> 00:20:56,206
Wonderful. Teach him sarcasm.
Thank you very much.

348
00:20:59,012 --> 00:21:00,808
- Sorry.
- Sorry.
