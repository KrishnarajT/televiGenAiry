1
00:00:01,590 --> 00:00:03,626
I decided if I was gonna
get my boobs done...

2
00:00:03,889 --> 00:00:06,687
I might as well go whole-hog,
you know what I mean?

3
00:00:06,982 --> 00:00:09,257
Yeah, I know what you mean.

4
00:00:09,574 --> 00:00:12,247
They're still pretty natural-Iooking,
don't you think?

5
00:00:12,541 --> 00:00:14,532
They fooled me.

6
00:00:14,798 --> 00:00:17,631
Oh, yeah, gotta get right up on them
before you can tell.

7
00:00:18,226 --> 00:00:21,104
I think they're really gonna help me
reach my career goals.

8
00:00:22,489 --> 00:00:24,605
Do you remember what they were?

9
00:00:24,872 --> 00:00:26,669
What what were?

10
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:29,070
My career goals.

11
00:00:29,386 --> 00:00:33,345
Yeah, sure.
You wanna be an actress, right?

12
00:00:33,733 --> 00:00:36,770
No, silly. I wanna be a talk show host.

13
00:00:37,746 --> 00:00:39,020
Right.

14
00:00:42,678 --> 00:00:46,148
Of course, what they don't tell you is:
Big boobies equal bad back.

15
00:00:46,482 --> 00:00:48,757
Say that three times fast.

16
00:00:49,031 --> 00:00:52,307
- No, thank you.
- Big boobies equal bad back.

17
00:00:52,626 --> 00:00:56,016
Big boobies equal bad back.
Big boobies equal bad back.

18
00:00:57,475 --> 00:01:00,785
Get your skinny little butt in here,
and I'll interview you standing up.

19
00:01:01,488 --> 00:01:03,206
I'll be right there.

20
00:01:03,494 --> 00:01:05,132
Okay, we're back.

21
00:01:05,375 --> 00:01:08,208
Now, let's give a warm, soapy welcome
to my next guest...

22
00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:12,867
and my close personal friend,
Charlie Harper.

23
00:01:19,377 --> 00:01:20,776
Hey. Where you off to?

24
00:01:21,718 --> 00:01:24,835
I don't know. Anywhere.

25
00:01:26,316 --> 00:01:28,830
Charlie, the shower's still running.

26
00:01:29,116 --> 00:01:30,390
Oh, fine.

27
00:01:34,885 --> 00:01:36,955
There you are.

28
00:01:41,196 --> 00:01:43,664
Charlie! Charlie, help me!

29
00:01:44,206 --> 00:01:47,198
- What's going on?
- Nothing. Go watch TV.

30
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:49,586
Yeah, right.

31
00:01:59,337 --> 00:02:03,046
Well, I'm sorry, Alan, but who told you
to go sticking your hand in my shower?

32
00:02:03,893 --> 00:02:06,805
Oh, please. How can she sue you?
You have no money.

33
00:02:09,118 --> 00:02:10,517
Oh, boy.

34
00:02:11,333 --> 00:02:15,008
Nothing. Just saw an old girlfriend.
Talk to you later.

35
00:02:16,683 --> 00:02:17,957
Lisa?

36
00:02:18,731 --> 00:02:20,005
Oh, boy.

37
00:02:20,905 --> 00:02:23,214
Charlie. I don't believe it.

38
00:02:23,998 --> 00:02:25,989
- You look great.
- You too.

39
00:02:26,715 --> 00:02:30,867
Although if you're taking votes, I prefer
the brown sock to the beige one.

40
00:02:31,229 --> 00:02:34,460
What? Oh, I got kind of dressed
in a hurry this morning.

41
00:02:34,824 --> 00:02:37,657
Really? Did somebody's husband
come home early?

42
00:02:38,795 --> 00:02:41,992
Why do you always assume the worst?
Can't I just be hung-over?

43
00:02:43,058 --> 00:02:44,969
Sorry. So how are you?

44
00:02:45,274 --> 00:02:48,744
Fine. I mean, you know, considering.

45
00:02:49,119 --> 00:02:50,871
And you? How's married life?

46
00:02:51,167 --> 00:02:53,601
Really great.
Best decision I ever made.

47
00:02:53,884 --> 00:02:55,920
You deserve all the
happiness in the world...

48
00:02:56,183 --> 00:02:59,619
and you found a guy who can give it.
- Thanks. That's very sweet.

49
00:02:59,987 --> 00:03:03,423
- I mean it sincerely. It warms my heart...
- Okay, we broke up.

50
00:03:04,668 --> 00:03:08,104
Oh, I am so, so sorry. Honestly.

51
00:03:08,932 --> 00:03:11,162
Yes. Yes.

52
00:03:13,488 --> 00:03:17,800
- So, what happened?
- None of your business.

53
00:03:18,922 --> 00:03:20,640
Okay.

54
00:03:26,571 --> 00:03:28,801
I thought he was the sweetest guy
in the world...

55
00:03:29,079 --> 00:03:30,876
but after we got married,
he changed.

56
00:03:31,127 --> 00:03:34,119
He started drinking a lot,
and lying around the house all day.

57
00:03:34,471 --> 00:03:36,587
Oh, no.

58
00:03:36,895 --> 00:03:38,965
I caught him in the shower
with some bimbo.

59
00:03:39,278 --> 00:03:41,189
Some guys, huh?

60
00:03:41,493 --> 00:03:44,565
Yeah. If I wanted that kind of life,
I could have stayed with you.

61
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:48,269
Good point.
So, what are you doing for dinner?

62
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:51,152
- You're shameless.
- Thank you.

63
00:03:51,399 --> 00:03:53,117
- It's not a compliment.
- Whatever.

64
00:03:53,364 --> 00:03:54,877
What are you doing for dinner?

65
00:03:55,161 --> 00:03:57,197
Charlie, a lot has changed.

66
00:03:57,502 --> 00:04:01,620
I know. I'm older and wiser,
and you're hot and on the rebound.

67
00:04:02,016 --> 00:04:03,415
- Charlie.
- Dinner tonight.

68
00:04:03,646 --> 00:04:05,557
I won't take no for an answer.

69
00:04:06,656 --> 00:04:09,216
Hey, lady.
Lady, you forgot your baby.

70
00:04:09,498 --> 00:04:11,693
Charlie, it's not her baby.

71
00:04:13,552 --> 00:04:16,146
Shall we say 7?

72
00:04:20,324 --> 00:04:24,954
Just out of curiosity, what the hell
happened in your brother's bathroom?

73
00:04:26,385 --> 00:04:28,421
- Nothing.
- Dad was wrestling on the floor...

74
00:04:28,684 --> 00:04:30,402
with a naked lady.

75
00:04:31,024 --> 00:04:33,538
The quiet ones are always the freaks.

76
00:04:34,786 --> 00:04:37,425
- Jake, I was not wrestling.
- But she was naked.

77
00:04:37,754 --> 00:04:39,790
She was taking a shower,
and I didn't know.

78
00:04:40,053 --> 00:04:42,248
When I reached to turn it off,
she was startled.

79
00:04:42,519 --> 00:04:46,034
It was innocent and there's no reason
to tell your mother, understand?

80
00:04:46,406 --> 00:04:50,115
Sure. By the way,
you have to sign my math test.

81
00:04:50,502 --> 00:04:55,178
Okay. D minus?
Jake, how do you get a D minus?

82
00:04:55,602 --> 00:04:57,718
How do you get wrapped
in a shower curtain...

83
00:04:57,984 --> 00:04:59,781
with a naked lady?

84
00:05:01,245 --> 00:05:02,997
- Did you show this to your mother?
- No.

85
00:05:03,251 --> 00:05:06,561
- Why not?
- I didn't catch her doing anything.

86
00:05:10,022 --> 00:05:11,296
Okay, I'll sign this.

87
00:05:12,154 --> 00:05:14,748
But you are gonna go study
so this won't happen again.

88
00:05:15,331 --> 00:05:17,970
All right, but I wouldn't
get my hopes up.

89
00:05:19,469 --> 00:05:22,586
If you want something from Dad,
now's a good time.

90
00:05:24,861 --> 00:05:27,853
Oh, Alan, I am having the best day.

91
00:05:28,205 --> 00:05:32,244
- Really? Do share it with me.
- Remember Lisa?

92
00:05:32,636 --> 00:05:36,595
Oh, is that the girl who bitch-slapped
me in your shower this morning?

93
00:05:39,156 --> 00:05:42,068
No, that's Meegan...

94
00:05:42,375 --> 00:05:45,651
or Megan or Sue.

95
00:05:48,143 --> 00:05:51,931
Lisa is the woman that I asked to marry,
but she married this other guy instead.

96
00:05:52,281 --> 00:05:55,034
They're divorced and we're
having dinner. Isn't that great?

97
00:05:55,374 --> 00:05:58,969
I'd applaud, but my hand
was bitten earlier.

98
00:05:59,721 --> 00:06:01,074
I'm sensing you're upset?

99
00:06:01,351 --> 00:06:03,660
Oh, no, no, no.
Why would I be upset?

100
00:06:03,985 --> 00:06:06,704
I mean, besides the...
The bite and the mild concussion...

101
00:06:06,994 --> 00:06:10,270
that I got from my head bouncing
off your bathroom floor...

102
00:06:10,589 --> 00:06:13,626
while your shower buddy
was driving her knee into my groin.

103
00:06:15,019 --> 00:06:18,455
She wants to be a talk show host.
I don't see it. Not with that voice.

104
00:06:19,032 --> 00:06:21,865
And to top it all off, my son
saw me entwined on the floor...

105
00:06:22,167 --> 00:06:26,319
with Meegan or Megan or Sue...

106
00:06:26,681 --> 00:06:28,751
and is now blackmailing me.

107
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:31,458
Kid's a genius.

108
00:06:34,038 --> 00:06:36,154
Anyway, here's the wrinkle with Lisa.

109
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:37,694
She's got a kid now.

110
00:06:37,925 --> 00:06:40,359
I'm not sure where I'm at
with having an instant family.

111
00:06:40,684 --> 00:06:42,959
I'm sorry. Are we done
with what's bothering me?

112
00:06:44,947 --> 00:06:46,346
I am.

113
00:06:48,542 --> 00:06:50,692
It's like talking to a horny chimp.

114
00:06:52,095 --> 00:06:54,689
Well, that was uncalled for.

115
00:06:57,194 --> 00:06:59,662
- So, what do you think?
- About what?

116
00:07:00,162 --> 00:07:01,800
Lisa, me, the kid.

117
00:07:02,210 --> 00:07:04,246
Okay, let's see now.

118
00:07:04,509 --> 00:07:06,625
This is the same woman
you've broken up...

119
00:07:06,892 --> 00:07:09,452
and gotten back with for years, right?
- Right.

120
00:07:09,776 --> 00:07:12,415
And she turned you down
in order to marry somebody else?

121
00:07:12,743 --> 00:07:14,734
- Yes.
- And then the marriage fell apart...

122
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,309
and now she's got his baby?
- Yeah.

123
00:07:18,762 --> 00:07:21,435
Sounds perfect. Go for it.

124
00:07:24,071 --> 00:07:26,869
Okay, don't think I don't know
what you're doing.

125
00:07:32,305 --> 00:07:34,216
Are you gonna be okay?

126
00:07:35,398 --> 00:07:37,468
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

127
00:07:39,118 --> 00:07:42,315
It's just nobody's taken a crap
in my car since college.

128
00:07:44,301 --> 00:07:45,700
Don't be such a baby.

129
00:07:45,973 --> 00:07:48,168
Hey, tell her.

130
00:07:48,774 --> 00:07:52,164
I'll change her diaper while your car
airs out. Then you can take us home.

131
00:07:52,494 --> 00:07:54,450
But what if it happens again?

132
00:07:54,751 --> 00:07:57,345
Don't worry. I'll hold her out
the window till we arrive.

133
00:07:57,677 --> 00:08:00,396
Thank you.
Can I make you a nightcap?

134
00:08:00,728 --> 00:08:02,684
Charlie, I'm breastfeeding, remember?

135
00:08:02,985 --> 00:08:04,384
Oh, right, right.

136
00:08:04,616 --> 00:08:07,005
And may I say, on behalf
of myself, the maître d'...

137
00:08:07,291 --> 00:08:10,886
and the entire kitchen staff that found
a reason to walk past our table:

138
00:08:11,262 --> 00:08:13,139
You're doing a hell of a job.

139
00:08:17,364 --> 00:08:19,559
Look at what a good
poopie you made.

140
00:08:22,338 --> 00:08:25,569
Mommy's gonna get you
all cleaned up.

141
00:08:29,402 --> 00:08:32,121
- Would you throw this away?
- Sure.

142
00:09:15,213 --> 00:09:17,443
You didn't throw that
on the beach, did you?

143
00:09:17,721 --> 00:09:20,315
No, no. I threw it
on my neighbor's deck.

144
00:09:22,152 --> 00:09:24,666
Long story. He started it.

145
00:09:26,248 --> 00:09:28,398
- So how we doing?
- All done.

146
00:09:28,714 --> 00:09:30,591
Oh, good.

147
00:09:33,187 --> 00:09:36,099
Boy, you hear all these horror stories
about screaming babies...

148
00:09:36,405 --> 00:09:38,680
but she's not half bad.

149
00:09:38,955 --> 00:09:40,991
She's my little angel.

150
00:09:41,296 --> 00:09:44,732
Kind of weird, huh?
You and me and a baby.

151
00:09:45,058 --> 00:09:46,776
Yeah.

152
00:09:47,022 --> 00:09:51,857
Not that the baby's weird.
It's just the whole, you know, gestalt.

153
00:09:56,970 --> 00:09:58,642
You are so sweet.

154
00:09:58,935 --> 00:10:00,573
I know.

155
00:10:02,488 --> 00:10:04,240
Wanna go upstairs?

156
00:10:05,038 --> 00:10:08,075
- No, I have to go home.
- Why?

157
00:10:08,381 --> 00:10:10,975
What do you mean, why?
I have a baby.

158
00:10:11,266 --> 00:10:13,985
Okay, she can stay too.

159
00:10:14,317 --> 00:10:17,354
I can't spend the night.
I didn't bring enough diapers...

160
00:10:17,661 --> 00:10:19,652
the bassinet.
I don't have a breast pump.

161
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:22,679
So? We'll do it the old-fashioned way.

162
00:10:23,011 --> 00:10:25,969
What are you gonna do, Charlie?
Milk me?

163
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:28,992
What kind of thing is that to say?

164
00:10:29,281 --> 00:10:32,193
What makes you think I'm ready
to jump back into bed with you?

165
00:10:33,252 --> 00:10:35,812
I don't know. Because I'm sweet?

166
00:10:36,136 --> 00:10:37,774
You weren't ready when I was single.

167
00:10:38,017 --> 00:10:39,894
How are you gonna
handle me and a baby?

168
00:10:40,148 --> 00:10:43,936
Easy. I love babies, babies love me.
Look how good I get along with Jake.

169
00:10:44,286 --> 00:10:45,560
Jake's 11.

170
00:10:45,791 --> 00:10:48,703
So? He was 10 when I met him.

171
00:10:49,887 --> 00:10:52,526
Gosh, they grow so quickly, don't they?

172
00:10:53,566 --> 00:10:56,717
- Okay, look. If you're serious...
- I am.

173
00:10:57,035 --> 00:11:01,153
- Come over tomorrow night to our place.
I'll make dinner, we'll see what happens.

174
00:11:01,508 --> 00:11:03,226
Or we go to your place now...

175
00:11:03,472 --> 00:11:06,032
having already eaten,
and see what happens.

176
00:11:06,314 --> 00:11:08,748
Still incapable of delaying
gratification, aren't you?

177
00:11:09,031 --> 00:11:10,828
No, no, no, I've grown.

178
00:11:11,079 --> 00:11:13,195
I learned to put the needs
of others before me.

179
00:11:13,462 --> 00:11:15,259
- Really?
- Oh, yeah. Absolutely.

180
00:11:15,510 --> 00:11:17,978
The old thoughtless,
selfish Charlie is gone...

181
00:11:18,269 --> 00:11:19,861
and I say good riddance to him.

182
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:23,374
Now, come on.
I'll take you home.

183
00:11:24,413 --> 00:11:25,926
- Charlie?
- Yeah?

184
00:11:26,169 --> 00:11:27,522
The baby.

185
00:11:45,187 --> 00:11:46,461
This makes no sense.

186
00:11:46,692 --> 00:11:48,967
It's math. It makes perfect sense.

187
00:11:49,242 --> 00:11:53,155
Well, then I guess we'll just
have to agree to disagree.

188
00:11:53,547 --> 00:11:55,378
No, you just have to do the work.

189
00:11:55,888 --> 00:12:00,484
Well, maybe I have a learning disability,
or a syndrome of some sort.

190
00:12:00,903 --> 00:12:03,576
You don't have a learning disability.
You're just lazy.

191
00:12:04,331 --> 00:12:06,162
Maybe that's the syndrome.

192
00:12:22,346 --> 00:12:25,338
See you later. And by "later,"
I'm hoping tomorrow.

193
00:12:25,648 --> 00:12:29,004
Is there anything in your shower
I need to know about?

194
00:12:31,207 --> 00:12:34,165
Oh, come on. That's the most
action you've had in months.

195
00:12:34,928 --> 00:12:37,158
I have a loose tooth.

196
00:12:37,979 --> 00:12:41,415
Can't you just be happy for me?
The woman I love is back in my life.

197
00:12:41,741 --> 00:12:45,893
That's great. I'm thrilled.
I can't eat apples.

198
00:12:47,258 --> 00:12:49,897
I'll bring you back some
applesauce from Lisa's.

199
00:12:51,145 --> 00:12:54,296
Her kid needs to lay off
the fiber anyway.

200
00:12:54,615 --> 00:12:56,685
Oh, yeah. How's that working out?

201
00:12:56,955 --> 00:13:00,265
With the kid? She's great. I love kids.

202
00:13:00,592 --> 00:13:03,948
Really? Tell me. How many
diapers have you changed so far?

203
00:13:04,270 --> 00:13:07,979
Well, none, actually.
But I am credited with an assist.

204
00:13:09,077 --> 00:13:10,988
- Have you fed the baby?
- No.

205
00:13:11,292 --> 00:13:14,284
- Dressed the baby? Bathed the baby?
- No. What's your point, Alan?

206
00:13:14,636 --> 00:13:17,867
- Nothing. Have fun.
- Thanks.

207
00:13:18,231 --> 00:13:20,142
I intend to.

208
00:13:23,205 --> 00:13:25,639
Don't think I don't know
what you're doing.

209
00:13:32,359 --> 00:13:35,351
- What was that?
- Coyotes, Charlie.

210
00:13:37,458 --> 00:13:39,767
Probably dropped her pacifier.
I'll be right back.

211
00:13:40,050 --> 00:13:42,962
- No, no, no. You stay. I'll take care of it.
- Really?

212
00:13:43,268 --> 00:13:47,341
Oh, yeah. No problem.
I'm great with babies.

213
00:13:48,284 --> 00:13:50,275
Pacifier is the little nipple thing, right?

214
00:13:52,213 --> 00:13:53,328
Be right back.

215
00:13:58,023 --> 00:13:59,979
Hey, little baby, you decent?

216
00:14:00,866 --> 00:14:03,221
Okay, here's your pacifier, sweetie.

217
00:14:03,499 --> 00:14:06,457
Not as good as the real thing,
am I right?

218
00:14:09,016 --> 00:14:12,213
Smells like one of us
just crapped our pants.

219
00:14:12,527 --> 00:14:14,643
I sure hope it's you.

220
00:14:15,244 --> 00:14:17,394
Let's take a look.

221
00:14:19,926 --> 00:14:21,644
Charlie? You okay?

222
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:26,244
- What?
- Is everything okay?

223
00:14:26,530 --> 00:14:29,727
Oh, yeah. Just a little
diaper issue. I can take care of it.

224
00:14:31,044 --> 00:14:33,763
And then I'll be back
to take care of you.

225
00:14:38,192 --> 00:14:40,660
Okay. Let's just take this thing off.

226
00:14:41,201 --> 00:14:43,476
Oh, sweet Lord.

227
00:14:45,507 --> 00:14:48,624
Did you have Thai food
for dinner, or what?

228
00:14:49,394 --> 00:14:52,670
Man, Babe Ruth took smaller dumps.

229
00:14:55,037 --> 00:14:56,709
Do you need any help?

230
00:14:59,217 --> 00:15:00,775
What?

231
00:15:01,014 --> 00:15:02,572
Do you need any help?

232
00:15:02,811 --> 00:15:04,563
No, we're good.

233
00:15:09,833 --> 00:15:13,348
Okay. Now we wipe the tushy.

234
00:15:14,849 --> 00:15:17,044
Sorry. It's not you. It's me.

235
00:15:17,315 --> 00:15:21,593
Wipe it again. Third time's the charm.

236
00:15:21,955 --> 00:15:25,106
Little powder. Oh, that smells nice.

237
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:30,373
Maybe a little powder for my tushy.
Don 't tell your mommy.

238
00:15:32,154 --> 00:15:35,146
Charlie, I can hear you on the monitor.

239
00:15:36,125 --> 00:15:37,399
Oh, right.

240
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:40,353
People of Earth...

241
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:42,914
we mean you no harm.

242
00:15:46,198 --> 00:15:49,873
See? This one is wrong, this is wrong.
Jake, you have to check your work.

243
00:15:50,211 --> 00:15:51,724
These are careless mistakes.

244
00:15:52,008 --> 00:15:56,286
Maybe I'm not careless.
Maybe I ate lead paint as a child.

245
00:15:57,233 --> 00:16:00,589
- Here. Do it again.
- Fine.

246
00:16:04,339 --> 00:16:06,978
Dad, are you and Mom related?

247
00:16:13,033 --> 00:16:14,512
I'm sorry. What?

248
00:16:14,956 --> 00:16:18,426
Well, if you marry your cousin,
your kids will be stupid, right?

249
00:16:20,975 --> 00:16:23,489
Jake, you're not stupid,
your mother's not my cousin...

250
00:16:23,775 --> 00:16:27,245
and you're not going anywhere
until you do your homework.

251
00:16:29,585 --> 00:16:31,815
Like I have somewhere to go.

252
00:16:33,431 --> 00:16:38,266
There we go.
You were a hungry little girl.

253
00:16:39,115 --> 00:16:40,707
Of course she was hungry.

254
00:16:40,955 --> 00:16:44,265
She must of dropped half her
body weight in that last diaper.

255
00:16:47,642 --> 00:16:50,679
What a good burp.
Wasn't that a good burp, Charlie?

256
00:16:51,028 --> 00:16:54,577
Oh, yeah. Wait till you
meet my nephew.

257
00:16:54,915 --> 00:16:57,873
He can belch the theme from Shaft.

258
00:16:58,928 --> 00:17:01,044
All right. Good night, sweetheart.

259
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:03,948
Oh, there we go.

260
00:17:07,246 --> 00:17:09,123
Now, where were we?

261
00:17:09,545 --> 00:17:10,819
Oh, yeah.

262
00:17:11,468 --> 00:17:13,982
You know, I'm a little tired.
Aren't you tired?

263
00:17:14,310 --> 00:17:16,619
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

264
00:17:16,943 --> 00:17:20,219
Was it the breastfeeding? Because
in the restaurant, it turned you on.

265
00:17:21,123 --> 00:17:23,956
I know, but there I wasn't on deck.

266
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:26,398
So you don't wanna fool around?

267
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:30,376
It's not that. I'm looking
at the sexiest woman in the world...

268
00:17:30,695 --> 00:17:33,448
and all I can see is a Thermos.

269
00:17:34,164 --> 00:17:38,123
Charlie, there are things you do with
your penis that aren't exactly a turn-on.

270
00:17:38,511 --> 00:17:40,866
You mean the puppet show?

271
00:17:42,022 --> 00:17:45,776
I thought you loved The Amazing
Adventures of Stretch Armstrong.

272
00:17:46,328 --> 00:17:50,480
That's not what I meant.
Now, come on. Come to mama.

273
00:17:51,427 --> 00:17:55,659
Okay, time. "Come to mama"
bums me a little.

274
00:17:56,234 --> 00:17:59,783
Can we make it
"Come to Catholic schoolgirl"?

275
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:03,128
Yes, Monsignor.

276
00:18:03,632 --> 00:18:05,588
Hallelujah.

277
00:18:11,198 --> 00:18:13,792
Here you go. Two sugars, no cream.

278
00:18:14,082 --> 00:18:19,600
Oh, perfect. And I don't mind saying,
last night was none too shabby either.

279
00:18:20,394 --> 00:18:25,343
"Dear diary: Coffee perfect,
sex none too shabby."

280
00:18:26,329 --> 00:18:28,320
You know what I mean.

281
00:18:28,628 --> 00:18:31,096
I can't remember
why we kept breaking up.

282
00:18:31,596 --> 00:18:35,987
- You can't?
- Well, I can. I was just being romantic.

283
00:18:36,403 --> 00:18:39,236
- What are you doing?
- Putting on my pants.

284
00:18:39,579 --> 00:18:41,888
You're leaving already?

285
00:18:43,634 --> 00:18:44,908
No.

286
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:48,013
So why are you putting
on your pants, then?

287
00:18:49,193 --> 00:18:51,866
I don't know.
Did you wanna wear them?

288
00:18:54,251 --> 00:18:56,003
Forget it.

289
00:18:57,594 --> 00:18:59,471
Hey, I've gotta go home
sooner or later.

290
00:18:59,768 --> 00:19:02,077
- Go home whenever you want.
- I can't leave...

291
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:04,191
when you're in this mood.
- What mood?

292
00:19:04,449 --> 00:19:05,723
This mood.

293
00:19:05,954 --> 00:19:08,548
Oh, just leave, Charlie.
It's what you do best.

294
00:19:09,758 --> 00:19:13,433
No, it's what I do after
I do what I do best.

295
00:19:16,278 --> 00:19:19,236
Oh, come on.
I was just putting on my pants.

296
00:19:19,539 --> 00:19:23,327
- You wanna spend the day with us?
- The whole day?

297
00:19:26,101 --> 00:19:29,411
- Here are your shoes.
- Hang on a second.

298
00:19:29,738 --> 00:19:31,933
Is this some hormonal
thing because of the baby?

299
00:19:32,204 --> 00:19:35,833
No, it's some kind of
stupid thing because you're stupid.

300
00:19:37,429 --> 00:19:40,182
Any time I don't behave the way
you want, it's hormonal.

301
00:19:40,772 --> 00:19:43,605
Not every time, but you
gotta admit there is a pattern.

302
00:19:43,949 --> 00:19:45,587
You know the pattern I see?

303
00:19:45,830 --> 00:19:49,266
Every time things start going well for us,
you find an excuse to run.

304
00:19:49,634 --> 00:19:51,226
No, no, no. You push me away.

305
00:19:51,515 --> 00:19:53,392
How? How do I push you away?

306
00:19:53,688 --> 00:19:56,600
Like this. You pick a fight over
nothing and say I can't commit.

307
00:19:56,907 --> 00:19:59,182
- You can't commit.
- Hey, I can commit.

308
00:19:59,457 --> 00:20:01,334
Oh, yeah? Prove it.

309
00:20:01,630 --> 00:20:04,269
Fine. I'll start right now.

310
00:20:09,028 --> 00:20:11,496
I'm gonna stay here all day.

311
00:20:15,131 --> 00:20:17,770
- Really?
- Really.

312
00:20:19,645 --> 00:20:22,205
We're talking a business day, right?

313
00:20:26,667 --> 00:20:31,104
- Hey. How did it go with Lisa?
- I don't think it's gonna work out.

314
00:20:31,683 --> 00:20:35,392
Really? Even with the little baby
there to help smooth things along?

315
00:20:36,741 --> 00:20:38,015
It wasn't the baby.

316
00:20:39,332 --> 00:20:41,926
She has commitment issues.

317
00:20:42,676 --> 00:20:45,827
Oh, that's too bad. Hey, what's that
splattered all over your shirt?

318
00:20:46,355 --> 00:20:48,744
Coffee and breast milk.

319
00:20:50,284 --> 00:20:53,481
What happened?
Did Starbucks merge with Hooters?

320
00:20:54,923 --> 00:20:56,993
Hooterbucks.

321
00:20:58,016 --> 00:21:01,247
I'd like a double-D cup latte, please.

322
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:15,335
Dad, you gotta sign this.

323
00:21:17,244 --> 00:21:20,475
Another D?
Jake, what is wrong with you?

324
00:21:20,797 --> 00:21:22,753
Well, I have a theory.

325
00:21:23,012 --> 00:21:24,650
Oh, really? Another one. Do tell.

326
00:21:24,935 --> 00:21:26,732
I'm a crack baby.

327
00:21:31,330 --> 00:21:33,286
Kid's a genius.
