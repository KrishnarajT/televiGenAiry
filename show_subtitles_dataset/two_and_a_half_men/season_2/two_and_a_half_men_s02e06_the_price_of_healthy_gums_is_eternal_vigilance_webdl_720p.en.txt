1
00:00:02,380 --> 00:00:04,257
- So, dear...
- What?

2
00:00:04,554 --> 00:00:06,272
Do you see anything you like?

3
00:00:06,645 --> 00:00:08,795
I don't know. What's venison?

4
00:00:09,111 --> 00:00:10,942
- Deer.
- What?

5
00:00:11,536 --> 00:00:13,333
- Deer.
- What?

6
00:00:14,338 --> 00:00:16,454
Deer. D-E-E-R.

7
00:00:16,763 --> 00:00:18,481
What? W-H-A-T.

8
00:00:21,194 --> 00:00:22,468
What's wrong with him?

9
00:00:23,787 --> 00:00:27,063
Jake, it's... It's the deer
in the forest, like... Like Bambi.

10
00:00:27,424 --> 00:00:29,699
Oh, cool, let's eat Bambi.

11
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:33,233
Coming soon to pay-per-view.

12
00:00:38,546 --> 00:00:40,298
Mom, wha...? What are you doing?

13
00:00:41,054 --> 00:00:43,124
- Nothing.
- Oh, that's stealing.

14
00:00:43,939 --> 00:00:47,136
Hardly. I'm paying $ 12 for a martini.

15
00:00:47,451 --> 00:00:49,840
They're lucky I don't take a chair.

16
00:00:50,587 --> 00:00:53,704
- You're paying?
- Figure of speech, Charles.

17
00:00:54,601 --> 00:00:55,829
Can I take this?

18
00:00:56,106 --> 00:00:57,539
- No.
- Oh, come on.

19
00:00:58,071 --> 00:01:00,346
My precious.

20
00:01:00,663 --> 00:01:03,382
Put it down. We do not take things
that don't belong to us.

21
00:01:03,673 --> 00:01:06,949
Listen who's taking the moral
high ground, Mr. Five-Finger Discount.

22
00:01:07,311 --> 00:01:09,700
- What does that mean?
- It doesn't mean anything.

23
00:01:09,987 --> 00:01:13,696
- How do you want your venison?
- Does it come with antlers?

24
00:01:14,377 --> 00:01:18,006
Alan, there's no reason
your son can't learn from your mistakes.

25
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:20,221
I didn't make a mistake, Mom.

26
00:01:20,523 --> 00:01:22,559
Unbelievable.
Twenty-five years later...

27
00:01:22,822 --> 00:01:24,653
and he still denies shoplifting.

28
00:01:25,833 --> 00:01:28,711
Oh, I get it. Five-finger discount.
Cool.

29
00:01:29,679 --> 00:01:32,068
I did not shoplift, Jake.
It was a misunderstanding.

30
00:01:32,522 --> 00:01:33,796
Alan, please.

31
00:01:34,069 --> 00:01:36,264
Walking around a toy store
with your brother...

32
00:01:36,536 --> 00:01:38,811
and the Silly Putty just jumped
in your pocket?

33
00:01:39,086 --> 00:01:40,804
Yes.

34
00:01:42,013 --> 00:01:44,288
Not much of a lie, Dad.

35
00:01:45,316 --> 00:01:47,386
Okay, everybody ready to order?

36
00:01:47,699 --> 00:01:49,769
Is that why you won't
let me have Silly Putty?

37
00:01:50,082 --> 00:01:51,993
It's a stupid, pointless toy.

38
00:01:52,298 --> 00:01:53,697
But why'd you steal it?

39
00:01:53,971 --> 00:01:57,520
I didn't. The security guard must have
planted it on me to make a bust.

40
00:01:57,859 --> 00:02:00,054
Oh, Alan.

41
00:02:00,326 --> 00:02:04,080
Who in their right mind would plant
Silly Putty on a 9-year-old boy?

42
00:02:04,549 --> 00:02:06,460
Who, indeed?

43
00:02:07,893 --> 00:02:11,090
- Hey, Jake, you ever eaten snails?
- Yeah, sure.

44
00:02:11,447 --> 00:02:13,085
I mean, in a restaurant.

45
00:02:14,081 --> 00:02:15,480
Oh, no.

46
00:02:28,547 --> 00:02:31,380
- You okay?
- No. That deer didn't have antlers...

47
00:02:31,683 --> 00:02:34,072
when I ate it,
but it's sure coming out that way.

48
00:02:36,115 --> 00:02:38,424
Well, you'll feel better tomorrow.

49
00:02:38,749 --> 00:02:40,819
We should sue that restaurant.

50
00:02:41,467 --> 00:02:44,618
Well, I'll get right on it. Come on.

51
00:02:45,522 --> 00:02:46,841
- Dad?
- Yeah.

52
00:02:47,069 --> 00:02:49,219
Did you ever steal a car?

53
00:02:49,494 --> 00:02:51,086
I never stole anything.

54
00:02:51,543 --> 00:02:52,862
It's okay. You could tell me.

55
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:55,320
I already know you got a rap sheet.

56
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:58,660
For the last time,
I did not take that Silly Putty.

57
00:02:58,943 --> 00:03:01,662
But the experience
did teach me a very important lesson.

58
00:03:01,954 --> 00:03:03,182
And you know what that was?

59
00:03:03,459 --> 00:03:06,656
If you get caught, stick to your story,
no matter how lame it is?

60
00:03:07,347 --> 00:03:10,703
- No, the lesson was...
- Hang on, Dad.

61
00:03:11,026 --> 00:03:12,539
Okay, go ahead.

62
00:03:13,159 --> 00:03:14,990
The lesson was...

63
00:03:15,249 --> 00:03:18,446
Oh, God, Jake. That's...
That's awful.

64
00:03:18,803 --> 00:03:22,716
Yeah, I wish I could have saved
that one for school.

65
00:03:36,029 --> 00:03:37,701
- You too?
- Yeah.

66
00:03:37,994 --> 00:03:41,907
Apparently Mom wasn't
the only parasite at dinner tonight.

67
00:03:43,931 --> 00:03:45,364
Hey...

68
00:03:45,603 --> 00:03:48,595
how much do you remember
about the whole Silly Putty incident?

69
00:03:48,948 --> 00:03:51,826
Oh, gee, not too much.

70
00:03:52,878 --> 00:03:56,917
I recall you crying when they dragged
you into the store manager's office.

71
00:03:57,937 --> 00:04:00,531
Then I went and got a corn dog
and an Orange Julius.

72
00:04:03,038 --> 00:04:05,268
Boy, those were good.

73
00:04:05,546 --> 00:04:07,377
- Remember those?
- No, I mean...

74
00:04:07,637 --> 00:04:09,434
did you see me take
the Silly Putty?

75
00:04:09,936 --> 00:04:13,406
Oh, no, no,
I was nowhere near the Silly Putty.

76
00:04:13,783 --> 00:04:17,458
I think I was in the doll section,
taking a peek under Barbie's dress.

77
00:04:18,215 --> 00:04:20,331
What a gyp that was.

78
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:23,837
If Jake had been caught
shoplifting and told me the story I told...

79
00:04:24,152 --> 00:04:25,744
there's no way I'd believe him.

80
00:04:26,535 --> 00:04:28,526
Well, let's just hope
he doesn't get caught.

81
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:34,032
- Can I tell you a little secret?
- Okay.

82
00:04:34,395 --> 00:04:37,865
I always knew
it wasn't the security guard.

83
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:41,138
Really?

84
00:04:43,008 --> 00:04:47,286
There's only one rational explanation
for how the Silly Putty got in my pants.

85
00:04:51,077 --> 00:04:52,988
And what would that be?

86
00:04:56,847 --> 00:05:03,286
That I actually stole it,
but my mind couldn't deal with it.

87
00:05:04,206 --> 00:05:07,164
So somehow, I blocked it out.

88
00:05:08,679 --> 00:05:11,239
The human brain, huh?
You gotta love it.

89
00:05:11,564 --> 00:05:13,794
That happens, right?
You do something horrible...

90
00:05:14,073 --> 00:05:17,110
and wake up with no recollection?
- Oh, yeah.

91
00:05:18,337 --> 00:05:21,727
And yet there she is,
lying right next to you.

92
00:05:22,811 --> 00:05:25,006
You know, that day changed my life.

93
00:05:25,278 --> 00:05:28,031
I mean, ever since, I've had to be
on guard against Bad Alan.

94
00:05:28,874 --> 00:05:30,432
I'm sorry, "Bad Alan"?

95
00:05:31,633 --> 00:05:35,308
Yeah, it's... It's what I call
my potential for evildoing.

96
00:05:36,441 --> 00:05:38,716
- Oh, God.
- It's why I've always worked so hard...

97
00:05:38,992 --> 00:05:42,667
to be a good son, a good student,
a good person.

98
00:05:43,047 --> 00:05:46,801
And you've succeeded.
You are good, good, good.

99
00:05:47,563 --> 00:05:51,636
Well, sure, I turned out great,
but at what cost?

100
00:05:51,994 --> 00:05:55,225
I mean, do you have any clue
how tightly wrapped I've had to be...

101
00:05:55,548 --> 00:05:58,142
to keep Bad Alan in check?

102
00:06:01,778 --> 00:06:03,734
I get glimpses.

103
00:06:04,997 --> 00:06:07,465
Well, I suppose
I should count my blessings...

104
00:06:07,757 --> 00:06:10,396
that I was stopped.
Who knows what kind of monster...

105
00:06:10,683 --> 00:06:13,481
I would've become if I hadn't
been caught with the putty.

106
00:06:14,195 --> 00:06:17,710
But what if the security guard
did plant it on you?

107
00:06:18,042 --> 00:06:20,431
That would mean there's no Bad Alan.

108
00:06:21,470 --> 00:06:23,142
That's true.

109
00:06:23,394 --> 00:06:25,703
But I can't afford
to take that chance.

110
00:06:29,958 --> 00:06:32,188
None of us can.

111
00:06:41,455 --> 00:06:43,173
He's fine.

112
00:06:48,187 --> 00:06:49,859
Hey, Charlie.

113
00:06:50,570 --> 00:06:51,639
Hey, Rose.

114
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:56,037
Looks like somebody needs
a shoulder to cry on.

115
00:06:56,382 --> 00:06:57,781
No, thank you.

116
00:06:58,221 --> 00:07:00,177
Wanna just make out then?

117
00:07:01,608 --> 00:07:05,123
- Rose...
- You're right. That was out of line.

118
00:07:05,454 --> 00:07:07,490
I deserve a spanking.

119
00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:11,449
Okay, what's up?

120
00:07:12,687 --> 00:07:14,917
- Can I trust you with something?
- You trust me...

121
00:07:15,196 --> 00:07:17,187
with your bank account number.

122
00:07:18,290 --> 00:07:20,087
I never gave you
my bank account number.

123
00:07:20,381 --> 00:07:22,736
Right, right. Go on.

124
00:07:24,102 --> 00:07:27,219
Have you ever done anything
so wrong, so horrible...?

125
00:07:27,572 --> 00:07:29,642
Oh, yeah.

126
00:07:30,415 --> 00:07:32,645
- Let me finish.
- I'm sorry.

127
00:07:32,923 --> 00:07:35,073
Something that seemed
harmless at the time...

128
00:07:35,348 --> 00:07:38,340
yet somehow managed
to mess up someone's entire life?

129
00:07:39,153 --> 00:07:40,905
Good question.

130
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:44,994
I think it's too early to say. Go on.

131
00:07:45,926 --> 00:07:47,279
Well, I have.

132
00:07:47,515 --> 00:07:50,791
Twenty-five years ago,
I put Silly Putty in my brother's pants.

133
00:07:51,153 --> 00:07:54,702
Well, if you left it in the egg,
it should still be good.

134
00:07:56,379 --> 00:07:59,018
My point is,
everybody thought he stole it...

135
00:07:59,347 --> 00:08:01,224
and I never told him the truth.

136
00:08:01,521 --> 00:08:03,034
Now you're wracked with guilt...

137
00:08:03,277 --> 00:08:06,587
and not sure whether a confession
will make things better or worse.

138
00:08:06,915 --> 00:08:08,667
Yes, exactly.

139
00:08:09,382 --> 00:08:11,896
That's a sexy feeling, isn't it?

140
00:08:12,768 --> 00:08:14,360
Come on, Rose.

141
00:08:14,608 --> 00:08:16,007
You want my advice, Charlie?

142
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:17,952
God help me, yes.

143
00:08:18,245 --> 00:08:20,281
Take your secret to the grave...

144
00:08:20,545 --> 00:08:23,378
but leave a manuscript explaining
every questionable act...

145
00:08:23,681 --> 00:08:25,876
you've committed
in a safety-deposit box...

146
00:08:26,189 --> 00:08:28,862
with instructions for it to be opened
at your death...

147
00:08:29,158 --> 00:08:32,992
and read in front of all your friends,
relatives and former lovers.

148
00:08:35,137 --> 00:08:37,128
I like it.

149
00:08:37,729 --> 00:08:39,048
Good.

150
00:08:39,987 --> 00:08:43,263
Now we can relax
and enjoy the evening.

151
00:08:53,951 --> 00:08:56,146
Sing it with me, Charlie.

152
00:09:07,163 --> 00:09:09,677
Three, four, five, six, seven.

153
00:09:09,964 --> 00:09:11,317
- Are you decent?
- Yeah.

154
00:09:11,553 --> 00:09:13,748
Three, four, five, six, seven.

155
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:16,833
What's up?

156
00:09:17,615 --> 00:09:21,733
- Nothing. Just came in to say good night.
- Three, four, five, six, seven.

157
00:09:23,971 --> 00:09:25,006
Why?

158
00:09:25,225 --> 00:09:27,659
Three, four, five, six, seven.

159
00:09:28,821 --> 00:09:31,858
Nothing. You just seemed stressed out
before, and I was concerned.

160
00:09:32,207 --> 00:09:34,846
Oh, thanks. You're a...
You're a good brother.

161
00:09:35,134 --> 00:09:37,568
Three, four, five, six, seven.

162
00:09:39,775 --> 00:09:41,049
You do that every night?

163
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,998
Are you kidding? After every meal.

164
00:09:43,245 --> 00:09:45,554
Three, four, five, six, seven.

165
00:09:46,088 --> 00:09:48,522
You are tightly wrapped, aren't you?

166
00:09:48,847 --> 00:09:51,919
The price of healthy gums
is eternal vigilance.

167
00:09:55,453 --> 00:09:58,286
Oh, God, I can't do this anymore.

168
00:09:59,634 --> 00:10:02,592
- Do what?
- I have to tell you something.

169
00:10:03,355 --> 00:10:05,744
- Okay.
- Come on out in the bedroom.

170
00:10:06,031 --> 00:10:07,623
All right.

171
00:10:11,550 --> 00:10:13,745
- What you doing?
- You'll understand in a minute.

172
00:10:14,017 --> 00:10:16,975
- I thought you had to tell me something.
- I do.

173
00:10:18,658 --> 00:10:21,377
There is no Bad Alan.

174
00:10:21,668 --> 00:10:22,862
I stole the Silly Putty...

175
00:10:23,090 --> 00:10:25,524
and put it in your pocket
when you weren't looking.

176
00:10:25,807 --> 00:10:29,846
- Three, four, five, six, seven.
- Damn you to hell!

177
00:10:30,532 --> 00:10:32,887
Come out here and die like a man!

178
00:10:33,542 --> 00:10:37,057
What do you know,
there is a Bad Alan.

179
00:10:40,525 --> 00:10:43,961
Hey, Dad, when you got arrested
for shoplifting, did they take you to jail?

180
00:10:45,249 --> 00:10:48,639
I did not get arrested,
and there was no jail.

181
00:10:49,012 --> 00:10:52,448
So I guess you never had to shank a guy
to get your props in the yard.

182
00:10:54,573 --> 00:10:57,212
You cracked the parental code
on the cable box again.

183
00:10:57,834 --> 00:11:01,543
It's 1-2-3-4.
A monkey could crack that.

184
00:11:07,952 --> 00:11:09,510
- Good morning.
- Morning.

185
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:11,183
Why are you walking like that?

186
00:11:11,464 --> 00:11:14,217
I spent the night in the bathroom.

187
00:11:14,767 --> 00:11:16,837
You too, huh?

188
00:11:20,202 --> 00:11:22,238
Tell Jake what you told me
last night.

189
00:11:23,631 --> 00:11:25,542
Oh, okay. Sure.

190
00:11:25,805 --> 00:11:28,399
Jake, your father didn't steal
the Silly Putty.

191
00:11:28,690 --> 00:11:30,646
- I did.
- Really?

192
00:11:30,947 --> 00:11:33,700
Yeah, I stuck it in his pocket,
so if anything happened...

193
00:11:33,999 --> 00:11:36,274
he'd be the one to get in trouble.

194
00:11:37,470 --> 00:11:39,222
What do you think now, Jake?

195
00:11:39,476 --> 00:11:41,592
I think Uncle Charlie's a genius.

196
00:11:42,445 --> 00:11:44,800
What? No, no. No genius. No, no.

197
00:11:45,288 --> 00:11:48,121
I mean, it's the perfect crime.
How did you think of that?

198
00:11:48,967 --> 00:11:50,241
I don't know.

199
00:11:50,472 --> 00:11:54,226
I saw the putty. Your dad was wearing
those dorky chinos with the big pockets.

200
00:11:54,570 --> 00:11:57,448
- And a light just went off in my head...
- Charlie.

201
00:11:58,416 --> 00:12:02,329
A bad light. A bad, evil light.
Because stealing is wrong...

202
00:12:02,681 --> 00:12:05,479
and letting somebody else
take the blame for it is worse.

203
00:12:05,817 --> 00:12:08,490
Yeah, so Dad was like a decoy.

204
00:12:10,667 --> 00:12:12,737
Well, technically, the term is "mule."

205
00:12:13,050 --> 00:12:16,486
- Mule? Why?
- Because he carries stuff.

206
00:12:17,482 --> 00:12:20,554
- Oh, of course...
- Okay, okay.

207
00:12:20,868 --> 00:12:23,780
The important thing is,
your father never stole in his life.

208
00:12:24,088 --> 00:12:26,318
And your Uncle Charlie
is a thief and a coward.

209
00:12:26,638 --> 00:12:28,833
Yeah, but you're a mule.

210
00:12:31,112 --> 00:12:33,421
Are you happy?
Go get dressed and washed.

211
00:12:33,746 --> 00:12:37,056
- Can we go to the mall?
- Why do you wa...? No.

212
00:12:38,303 --> 00:12:40,692
I need to get a different mule.

213
00:12:42,359 --> 00:12:44,554
Okay, can we please get past this?

214
00:12:44,867 --> 00:12:46,300
No. No, we can't.

215
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:51,409
I feel betrayed and hurt
in ways that I can't even express.

216
00:12:51,808 --> 00:12:53,878
And you think we can
just dance past that?

217
00:12:54,191 --> 00:12:56,068
I was hoping.

218
00:12:56,365 --> 00:12:58,401
Well, I am sorry,
but it is not that easy.

219
00:12:58,664 --> 00:13:02,896
I mean, thanks to you, my... My life
has been twisted beyond recognition.

220
00:13:03,263 --> 00:13:05,379
I mean, look at me, Charlie.

221
00:13:05,647 --> 00:13:08,525
I'm a... I'm a broke, hopelessly neurotic,
middle-aged man...

222
00:13:08,824 --> 00:13:11,099
who doesn't know who he is
or where he belongs.

223
00:13:11,375 --> 00:13:12,774
I have nothing, Charlie.

224
00:13:13,005 --> 00:13:16,839
- No... No wife, no home, nothing.
- Okay.

225
00:13:19,528 --> 00:13:21,678
So should I check back with you
after lunch?

226
00:13:26,301 --> 00:13:27,495
What do you want me to do?

227
00:13:27,722 --> 00:13:30,190
I said I was sorry.
L... I confessed to Jake.

228
00:13:30,482 --> 00:13:34,157
And I doubt I got more than six,
seven hours sleep last night.

229
00:13:34,495 --> 00:13:36,611
Nothing you can do.
The damage has been done.

230
00:13:36,879 --> 00:13:39,632
- It can't be undone.
- Come on, I'm your brother.

231
00:13:39,973 --> 00:13:42,965
- You're gonna forgive. You always do.
- No, no, this is different.

232
00:13:43,276 --> 00:13:46,746
- This is the worst thing you've ever done.
- No, it's not.

233
00:13:48,753 --> 00:13:50,072
What do you mean?

234
00:13:52,097 --> 00:13:55,453
Just making conversation.

235
00:13:59,038 --> 00:14:01,871
- Hey, Mom.
- Charlie, what are you doing here?

236
00:14:02,215 --> 00:14:06,128
- In the neighborhood. Thought I'd visit.
- Why?

237
00:14:08,278 --> 00:14:11,554
- I don't know. I'm your son.
- And...?

238
00:14:12,501 --> 00:14:15,732
- And I was hoping we could talk.
- About?

239
00:14:18,229 --> 00:14:19,981
May I please just come in?

240
00:14:20,277 --> 00:14:22,666
Are you fleeing from the law?

241
00:14:23,748 --> 00:14:26,660
- I'm not fleeing from anyone, Mom.
- Well, keep it in mind.

242
00:14:26,967 --> 00:14:30,243
No one would ever think
to look for you at your mother's house.

243
00:14:32,068 --> 00:14:35,424
- I get your point. I don't visit enough.
- You don't visit at all.

244
00:14:36,332 --> 00:14:37,845
And I'm riddled with guilt.

245
00:14:38,339 --> 00:14:40,648
Oh, you're just saying that
to make me feel better.

246
00:14:42,687 --> 00:14:44,564
So, what's up?

247
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:46,697
You know how the other night
at dinner...

248
00:14:46,952 --> 00:14:49,022
we were talking about
the Silly Putty deal?

249
00:14:50,004 --> 00:14:52,598
Did that venison disagree with you?

250
00:14:53,433 --> 00:14:55,424
Yeah, that's not
what I came to talk about.

251
00:14:56,025 --> 00:14:59,097
I've got a good mind
to sue that restaurant.

252
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:03,976
- Yeah, anyway, about the Silly Putty...
- What about it?

253
00:15:05,348 --> 00:15:07,782
Alan didn't steal it. I did.

254
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:11,470
I put it in his pocket.

255
00:15:11,787 --> 00:15:15,097
You framed your baby brother?

256
00:15:17,139 --> 00:15:18,731
How could you?

257
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:21,056
I know, I know.
It was a rotten thing to do.

258
00:15:21,362 --> 00:15:24,832
Rotten? It's unspeakable.

259
00:15:25,584 --> 00:15:28,656
Do you have any idea
what you put me through?

260
00:15:30,811 --> 00:15:33,166
- You?
- First the embarrassment...

261
00:15:33,445 --> 00:15:36,596
of people thinking
that I'd spawned a petty thief.

262
00:15:36,957 --> 00:15:41,030
Then all the trouble I went to
trying to figure out clever ways...

263
00:15:41,389 --> 00:15:44,267
to hide my jewelry
from his sticky little fingers.

264
00:15:44,608 --> 00:15:47,725
- That's really not what l...
- Not to mention the hundreds of hours...

265
00:15:48,036 --> 00:15:51,267
spent driving him to therapy
with that creepy Dr. Demerest...

266
00:15:51,590 --> 00:15:57,222
while I could have been...
I don't know, doing something fun.

267
00:15:58,656 --> 00:16:00,851
Okay, yeah,
it was a real imposition on you...

268
00:16:01,123 --> 00:16:04,877
and as it turns out, it had
kind of a negative impact on Alan too.

269
00:16:05,262 --> 00:16:07,822
Alan? Oh, yes, of course.

270
00:16:09,819 --> 00:16:13,812
You know, there was no insurance
for kleptomania therapy in those days.

271
00:16:14,168 --> 00:16:16,728
It was all out of pocket.

272
00:16:18,265 --> 00:16:21,416
Yeah, but about Alan...

273
00:16:21,735 --> 00:16:25,364
I was hoping you might have insight
as to how I could get him to forgive me.

274
00:16:25,958 --> 00:16:27,277
Why ask me?

275
00:16:28,257 --> 00:16:31,454
You know,
I'm starting to wonder that myself.

276
00:16:32,313 --> 00:16:34,224
I guess it's because he still loves you...

277
00:16:34,487 --> 00:16:37,160
despite all the lousy stuff
you did to him.

278
00:16:37,748 --> 00:16:40,979
I beg your pardon?
I was a wonderful mother.

279
00:16:41,302 --> 00:16:42,815
And if Alan thinks otherwise...

280
00:16:43,058 --> 00:16:48,052
it's only because that walleyed
Dr. Demerest put ideas into his head.

281
00:16:48,661 --> 00:16:51,459
Well, that was money well spent.

282
00:16:53,511 --> 00:16:54,864
Okay, then.

283
00:16:55,099 --> 00:16:58,808
I didn't need a reason to drink tonight,
but it's nice to know I've got one.

284
00:16:59,991 --> 00:17:01,822
Hey, Charlie, wait.

285
00:17:02,291 --> 00:17:04,407
- What?
- Have you forgotten why you came here?

286
00:17:04,925 --> 00:17:06,358
You want forgiveness, right?

287
00:17:07,392 --> 00:17:10,429
- Yes.
- Well...

288
00:17:10,736 --> 00:17:12,613
I forgive you.

289
00:17:19,558 --> 00:17:21,753
But next time, call first.

290
00:17:33,815 --> 00:17:35,089
Would you pass the salt?

291
00:17:39,083 --> 00:17:40,357
Could you get me the salt?

292
00:17:41,717 --> 00:17:44,311
- Dad, salt.
- Sure.

293
00:17:45,355 --> 00:17:48,313
- Here.
- Thanks.

294
00:17:49,285 --> 00:17:51,640
Oh, would you give me
the ketchup, please?

295
00:17:51,961 --> 00:17:54,316
Here. Here's the ketchup.

296
00:17:55,515 --> 00:17:56,914
Thank you.

297
00:18:02,539 --> 00:18:03,813
- Dad?
- Yeah.

298
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:06,615
If Uncle Charlie
let you kick him in the nuts...

299
00:18:06,887 --> 00:18:08,445
would that make you guys even?

300
00:18:09,103 --> 00:18:10,377
No.

301
00:18:11,319 --> 00:18:13,389
Boy, he's really mad at you.

302
00:18:14,246 --> 00:18:17,079
Relax, Jake. We're just having
a little communication problem.

303
00:18:17,758 --> 00:18:20,147
That's what Dad said
right before Mom threw him out.

304
00:18:20,433 --> 00:18:21,502
Nobody threw me out.

305
00:18:21,730 --> 00:18:24,608
Your mother and I mutually decided
that we weren't compatible.

306
00:18:24,949 --> 00:18:27,509
You don't seem compatible
with Uncle Charlie right now.

307
00:18:27,834 --> 00:18:30,632
- Well, it's not my fault.
- Was it your fault with Mom?

308
00:18:31,597 --> 00:18:33,110
No.

309
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:38,830
You know, Dad, maybe you're
the one who's not compatible.

310
00:18:40,669 --> 00:18:42,705
If you're done with dinner,
do your homework.

311
00:18:43,262 --> 00:18:46,652
Fine, kill the messenger.

312
00:18:49,282 --> 00:18:51,477
- Oh, come on, Alan. Talk to me.
- No.

313
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,549
Look, I wanna make this right,
but you gotta help me.

314
00:18:55,888 --> 00:18:58,846
Please, tell me what I can do.
I'm begging for your forgiveness.

315
00:18:59,191 --> 00:19:00,829
I am sorry,
but you did something...

316
00:19:01,073 --> 00:19:05,112
which affected my life
in a deeply destructive way and...

317
00:19:05,463 --> 00:19:07,693
l... I don't think I have it in me
to forgive you.

318
00:19:08,431 --> 00:19:11,821
- Hello? Anybody home?
- In here, Mom.

319
00:19:13,616 --> 00:19:16,574
Well, how are my boys
doing this evening?

320
00:19:21,978 --> 00:19:26,096
Well, I think Mommy
has the answer. Alan...

321
00:19:26,451 --> 00:19:29,170
if you find it intolerable
living under the same roof...

322
00:19:29,462 --> 00:19:31,259
with the brother
who betrayed you...

323
00:19:34,061 --> 00:19:37,292
then you and Jake
can come and live with me.

324
00:19:42,297 --> 00:19:44,015
We're good.

325
00:19:49,990 --> 00:19:52,299
Hey, Charlie, a couple of days ago...

326
00:19:52,582 --> 00:19:55,813
you said the Silly Putty wasn't
the worst thing you ever did to me.

327
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,238
It's ancient history. Let it go.

328
00:19:59,523 --> 00:20:02,162
I know, I know.
It's just... I'm curious.

329
00:20:02,450 --> 00:20:05,010
What else have you done to me
that I didn't know about?

330
00:20:05,293 --> 00:20:07,011
- It's not important.
- Yes, it is.

331
00:20:07,258 --> 00:20:09,249
The truth about
the shoplifting incident...

332
00:20:09,515 --> 00:20:11,506
it's allowed me
to reevaluate who I am...

333
00:20:11,773 --> 00:20:13,684
and... And feel better about myself.

334
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:15,753
- Well, that's great.
- Yeah.

335
00:20:15,996 --> 00:20:18,066
I feel a lot better since I confessed.

336
00:20:18,337 --> 00:20:20,248
Good, good.
So let's keep going with this.

337
00:20:21,389 --> 00:20:24,904
Okay, but you gotta promise that
no matter what I tell you, all is forgiven.

338
00:20:25,278 --> 00:20:27,428
Oh, absolutely, absolutely.

339
00:20:28,372 --> 00:20:30,328
You're probably gonna laugh.

340
00:20:30,629 --> 00:20:33,939
- I'm sure I will. Tell me.
- Well...

341
00:20:34,434 --> 00:20:36,868
remember how you were
a bed wetter till you were 8?

342
00:20:37,403 --> 00:20:38,802
Yeah.

343
00:20:41,082 --> 00:20:43,835
You actually stopped at 6.

344
00:20:46,768 --> 00:20:50,522
Wha...? What...? What did you do?
Did you sneak into my room and...?

345
00:20:50,865 --> 00:20:53,254
And...? And pour warm water on me
while I was asleep?

346
00:20:54,545 --> 00:20:58,663
Yeah, okay, let's say it was water,
and let's say I poured it.

347
00:21:02,614 --> 00:21:05,048
Well, I feel better. How about you?
