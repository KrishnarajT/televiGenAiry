1
00:00:02,404 --> 00:00:03,822
Can't we just go home?

2
00:00:04,030 --> 00:00:06,700
If I gotta drag you to the doctor
at 8 in the morning...

3
00:00:06,866 --> 00:00:08,994
you can cool your jets
while I get coffee.

4
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:10,620
I must look like an idiot.

5
00:00:10,829 --> 00:00:12,414
Wish I could tell you different.

6
00:00:12,622 --> 00:00:15,792
You're the reason we went
to the eye doctor in the first place.

7
00:00:16,001 --> 00:00:17,961
You said,
"Throw me a piece of toast."

8
00:00:20,005 --> 00:00:21,673
I threw you a piece of toast.

9
00:00:22,591 --> 00:00:24,342
Two cups of regular coffee, please.

10
00:00:25,010 --> 00:00:27,679
- My treat.
- Oh, that makes up for everything.

11
00:00:27,846 --> 00:00:31,224
Pigeons can feed out of my eye socket,
but I get a free cup of coffee.

12
00:00:33,018 --> 00:00:35,812
Just the coffee. Keep the change.

13
00:00:36,313 --> 00:00:38,898
I'm gonna need your help
until I get this patch off.

14
00:00:39,107 --> 00:00:41,651
I am absolutely there for you.

15
00:00:43,695 --> 00:00:45,572
Great.

16
00:00:49,868 --> 00:00:51,161
Great. So...

17
00:00:51,328 --> 00:00:54,289
So you'll drive me to work,
pick me up, get Jake at school...

18
00:00:54,497 --> 00:00:57,334
do the grocery shopping...
- Okay, I may have misspoken.

19
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:01,046
Charlie, you have to.
You know I can't drive.

20
00:01:05,675 --> 00:01:07,969
I don't see why not.

21
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:12,390
- Oh, look who's here.
- Who?

22
00:01:12,849 --> 00:01:15,268
A girl I used to go out with.
Over there.

23
00:01:16,269 --> 00:01:17,729
Hey, Sherri.

24
00:01:17,896 --> 00:01:21,024
- Hey, Charlie, long time.
- Yeah. Good to see you.

25
00:01:21,191 --> 00:01:22,859
- This is my brother, Alan.
- Hi.

26
00:01:23,026 --> 00:01:24,778
- Hi.
- What happened to your eye?

27
00:01:25,236 --> 00:01:27,697
Well, I wanted
a piece of toast, and...

28
00:01:27,864 --> 00:01:29,574
Bar fight.

29
00:01:30,867 --> 00:01:33,078
- Nice to meet you.
- Well, nice meeting you too.

30
00:01:33,286 --> 00:01:36,039
- Good to see you, Charlie.
- Good to see you too.

31
00:01:38,041 --> 00:01:40,377
- Wow, you went out with her?
- Yep.

32
00:01:40,543 --> 00:01:42,670
Why would you stop?

33
00:01:43,004 --> 00:01:45,256
I don't remember.
I probably got bored.

34
00:01:45,423 --> 00:01:47,258
Bored? How do you
get bored with that?

35
00:01:47,467 --> 00:01:50,512
For every beautiful woman,
there's at least one guy out there...

36
00:01:50,678 --> 00:01:54,474
who's tired of pretending to listen
to her in exchange for sex.

37
00:01:54,808 --> 00:01:58,019
Well, let me go on record as saying,
I am not that guy.

38
00:01:58,228 --> 00:02:01,189
If I ever had a woman like that,
I would cherish her.

39
00:02:01,356 --> 00:02:02,857
I would worship her. I would...

40
00:02:03,024 --> 00:02:06,861
start a small country and put her
face on a stamp so I could lick her head.

41
00:02:08,238 --> 00:02:10,365
- Why don't you go talk to her.
- Yeah, right.

42
00:02:10,532 --> 00:02:13,785
Gorgeous women like that are
not interested in pasty guys like me...

43
00:02:13,952 --> 00:02:16,162
unless we're in line
for the British throne.

44
00:02:16,788 --> 00:02:20,291
- So you give up without even trying?
- Yep. That's my motto.

45
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:24,087
Why waste time on 10s when you're
already getting rejected by sixes?

46
00:02:24,671 --> 00:02:28,800
Alan, listen to me. You are a smart,
sensitive, good-Iooking man...

47
00:02:28,967 --> 00:02:31,469
with some milky discharge
coming out of one eye...

48
00:02:31,636 --> 00:02:33,388
but who amongst us is perfect?

49
00:02:33,596 --> 00:02:35,849
That's the other thing.
Look at me. I'm a mess.

50
00:02:36,057 --> 00:02:39,602
So? Women like Sherri have big,
hunky guys hitting on them all day long.

51
00:02:39,769 --> 00:02:43,147
A guy like you walks up, makes a move,
you know what that says to her?

52
00:02:43,815 --> 00:02:45,191
Trick or treat?

53
00:02:46,943 --> 00:02:50,154
It says, "I'm confident in who I am."

54
00:02:50,363 --> 00:02:52,448
- You think?
- I know.

55
00:02:52,615 --> 00:02:55,952
So, what if she's not interested.
What's the worst that could happen?

56
00:02:56,119 --> 00:02:59,581
Actually, the worst that could happen
is she points at me...

57
00:02:59,747 --> 00:03:03,209
and laughs, causing every
seventh grader in the cafeteria to turn...

58
00:03:03,376 --> 00:03:05,587
and watch me slink back
to the geek table...

59
00:03:05,753 --> 00:03:08,256
with a growing wet spot
on the front of my chinos.

60
00:03:08,798 --> 00:03:10,425
We ninth graders enjoyed it also.

61
00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:15,179
But you're not in junior high anymore,
and you're not a...

62
00:03:15,972 --> 00:03:18,224
You're not in junior high anymore.

63
00:03:18,391 --> 00:03:20,894
- It's time to let go of those fears.
- I don't know.

64
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:22,353
Oh, come on, Alan.

65
00:03:22,562 --> 00:03:26,232
For once in your life, don't settle.
Go for what you really want.

66
00:03:29,819 --> 00:03:32,947
You know what? You're right.
I'm gonna go talk to her.

67
00:03:33,448 --> 00:03:34,949
Hold on.

68
00:03:35,116 --> 00:03:36,868
Let's clean some of that discharge.

69
00:03:37,702 --> 00:03:40,413
You wanna say "I'm confident,"
not "I'm infectious."

70
00:03:42,415 --> 00:03:43,791
There. Go get her.

71
00:03:48,379 --> 00:03:52,675
Hey, you see that guy over there?
Twenty bucks says he wets himself.

72
00:04:13,845 --> 00:04:16,181
- Hello.
- Hi.

73
00:04:16,348 --> 00:04:18,475
- Alan?
- I remember.

74
00:04:19,184 --> 00:04:21,853
Look, I needed to come clean
about something.

75
00:04:23,021 --> 00:04:26,275
I wasn't actually in a bar fight.

76
00:04:26,525 --> 00:04:29,528
I took a piece of whole-wheat toast
to the eye.

77
00:04:30,112 --> 00:04:32,781
I mean, it was cut diagonally
and toasted well...

78
00:04:32,948 --> 00:04:34,866
so it was essentially shrapnel.

79
00:04:37,536 --> 00:04:39,204
Did some real damage.

80
00:04:39,413 --> 00:04:43,083
I see. And why do you feel the need
to tell me all this?

81
00:04:43,292 --> 00:04:46,628
Well, I guess I didn't want
our relationship to start on a lie.

82
00:04:46,837 --> 00:04:48,588
Our relationship?

83
00:04:49,339 --> 00:04:51,300
- I'll go now.
- No, no, wait.

84
00:04:51,466 --> 00:04:52,884
Sit down. Join me.

85
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,054
Okay.

86
00:05:28,795 --> 00:05:31,339
- That's it. I'm out.
- Oh, come on.

87
00:05:32,049 --> 00:05:33,383
No, no, no. No more.

88
00:05:33,592 --> 00:05:35,260
You got a date. Leave it alone.

89
00:05:35,469 --> 00:05:37,596
Not just a date. A date with...

90
00:05:42,309 --> 00:05:43,977
Enough.

91
00:05:44,144 --> 00:05:46,813
- I'd think you'd be happy for me.
- I am happy for you.

92
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:48,648
You had the courage to walk over...

93
00:05:48,815 --> 00:05:51,485
with your pus-filled eye
and fall on your ass...

94
00:05:51,651 --> 00:05:55,989
and still got a date with one of
the most beautiful women I've ever met.

95
00:05:56,156 --> 00:05:58,700
- I'm not only happy for you, I'm proud.
- Thank you.

96
00:05:58,909 --> 00:06:01,620
Now, I have to re-evaluate
everything I thought I knew...

97
00:06:01,787 --> 00:06:05,248
about men, women, relationships,
God and the universe.

98
00:06:06,374 --> 00:06:08,418
But that's not your problem.

99
00:06:08,585 --> 00:06:11,713
Charlie, I am as surprised as you
that she said yes.

100
00:06:12,464 --> 00:06:13,965
I don't think so.

101
00:06:14,633 --> 00:06:18,887
I was really intimidated, but as it turns
out, she's just like a regular person...

102
00:06:19,054 --> 00:06:22,808
except for, you know,
being from the planet:

103
00:06:24,601 --> 00:06:27,270
Alan, never do that around me again.

104
00:06:28,146 --> 00:06:31,608
You know, actually,
we have a lot in common.

105
00:06:31,858 --> 00:06:33,819
Okay. I'll bite.

106
00:06:34,027 --> 00:06:36,112
Well, we both went through
tough divorces.

107
00:06:36,321 --> 00:06:38,532
- Sherri was married?
- You didn't know that?

108
00:06:38,698 --> 00:06:41,326
- It never came up.
- What did come up?

109
00:06:41,493 --> 00:06:42,994
Never mind. Scratch that.

110
00:06:43,703 --> 00:06:45,288
Where should
I take her to dinner?

111
00:06:45,497 --> 00:06:47,999
Where did you go
so I can take her somewhere else?

112
00:06:48,208 --> 00:06:51,336
Last thing you want is for her
to start comparing you to me.

113
00:06:51,545 --> 00:06:53,547
Exactly.

114
00:06:53,713 --> 00:06:55,757
Wait.

115
00:06:55,924 --> 00:06:57,259
What do you mean?

116
00:06:58,009 --> 00:07:00,220
You want your relationship
to stand on its own.

117
00:07:00,428 --> 00:07:02,889
- Right.
- Well, that's what I meant.

118
00:07:03,098 --> 00:07:07,519
Okay. I thought you were trying to rub
my nose in the fact that you dated her.

119
00:07:08,144 --> 00:07:10,188
Alan, I would never do that.

120
00:07:10,397 --> 00:07:11,982
Well, thank you.

121
00:07:12,857 --> 00:07:14,985
I don't have to.

122
00:07:18,738 --> 00:07:21,241
You think you could kill a guy
with a piece of toast?

123
00:07:21,408 --> 00:07:22,701
No.

124
00:07:22,909 --> 00:07:25,161
Because if you did,
you could eat the toast.

125
00:07:25,328 --> 00:07:28,331
The police would never find the
weapon. It's the perfect crime.

126
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:31,585
And part of a nutritious breakfast.

127
00:07:31,793 --> 00:07:34,921
Okay, guys, I guess I'll see you later.

128
00:07:35,088 --> 00:07:36,673
Where you going?

129
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:38,341
- Out for dinner.
- With who?

130
00:07:41,219 --> 00:07:43,972
Jake, look, I think...

131
00:07:44,139 --> 00:07:47,267
I think you're old enough to know
that your dad's not just a dad.

132
00:07:47,475 --> 00:07:50,020
He's also a man and that...

133
00:07:50,228 --> 00:07:52,397
even though I'm not married
to your mom...

134
00:07:52,605 --> 00:07:55,525
I still enjoy the company of women...

135
00:07:55,692 --> 00:07:59,237
which means that I will
occasionally go out with one.

136
00:07:59,446 --> 00:08:02,365
But the important thing
for you to understand...

137
00:08:02,574 --> 00:08:05,452
is that I am not trying to
replace your mother.

138
00:08:05,618 --> 00:08:08,288
In fact, no one
can replace your mother.

139
00:08:09,956 --> 00:08:13,376
I bet you could kill a guy
with a piece of bacon.

140
00:08:15,712 --> 00:08:17,964
All right, then.
I'm glad we had this talk.

141
00:08:18,590 --> 00:08:21,676
I'm gonna go post my plan
on the Internet.

142
00:08:23,762 --> 00:08:25,680
You know, there's moments
around here...

143
00:08:25,847 --> 00:08:28,558
that make me wish
I had a son of my own.

144
00:08:28,725 --> 00:08:30,268
That wasn't one of them.

145
00:08:31,394 --> 00:08:34,939
Yeah, well. Anyway, I really
appreciate you watching him tonight.

146
00:08:35,106 --> 00:08:36,399
No problem.

147
00:08:38,693 --> 00:08:41,529
- How you getting to the restaurant?
- Sherri's picking me up.

148
00:08:42,405 --> 00:08:44,157
- Very convenient.
- Why?

149
00:08:44,324 --> 00:08:46,743
Because she's been here before?
Been here with you?

150
00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:50,121
Because you've had sex with her
in every room in the house?

151
00:08:50,288 --> 00:08:51,831
No, because you can't drive.

152
00:08:53,291 --> 00:08:55,668
But it's interesting to see
how your mind works.

153
00:08:58,922 --> 00:09:02,175
Alan, let me give you some advice.

154
00:09:03,176 --> 00:09:07,472
Alcohol impairs your ability
to make good decisions.

155
00:09:07,639 --> 00:09:10,809
We don't want you to lose that ability.
We want her to.

156
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:15,021
Of course. Very good.

157
00:09:15,188 --> 00:09:16,523
What else?

158
00:09:16,731 --> 00:09:20,151
Well, women like Sherri already know
they're beautiful and desirable.

159
00:09:20,318 --> 00:09:23,238
- You won't score points by telling her.
- Okay.

160
00:09:23,404 --> 00:09:25,240
Don't be in a hurry
to spill your guts.

161
00:09:25,448 --> 00:09:27,116
She doesn't need your life story...

162
00:09:27,283 --> 00:09:29,160
before you get the salad.
- Got it.

163
00:09:29,369 --> 00:09:32,705
As someone who knows your life story,
I'd say she doesn't need to hear it at all.

164
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:37,085
Right, right.
I'll be cool, aloof, distant.

165
00:09:37,877 --> 00:09:40,547
She's here, she's here, she's here!

166
00:09:44,133 --> 00:09:46,386
What about the... What... What...

167
00:09:48,096 --> 00:09:49,556
What about the kiss goodnight?

168
00:09:49,722 --> 00:09:51,933
- Should I ask or just go for it?
- Go for it.

169
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:54,686
Don't wait until the last minute.
It creates pressure.

170
00:09:54,853 --> 00:09:56,813
- Get it out of the way early.
- How early?

171
00:09:57,021 --> 00:09:59,023
After dinner,
when you walk to the car...

172
00:09:59,190 --> 00:10:01,693
open her door, wait for her
to say thank you...

173
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:04,195
smile, lean in, and kiss her.

174
00:10:04,529 --> 00:10:06,531
Oh, nice.

175
00:10:13,663 --> 00:10:15,498
Hi, Alan. You ready?

176
00:10:15,873 --> 00:10:19,586
You're the most beautiful woman
I've ever seen, and I don't deserve you.

177
00:10:22,046 --> 00:10:24,507
That's another way to go.

178
00:10:29,461 --> 00:10:31,714
- Madam.
- Thank you.

179
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:37,177
- Sir.
- Oh, thank you.

180
00:10:41,432 --> 00:10:43,100
- Would you like the wine list?
- No.

181
00:10:43,267 --> 00:10:46,270
I'll have the Woodbridge Pinot Noir.
Or should we get a bottle?

182
00:10:46,937 --> 00:10:48,856
Oh, definitely get a bottle.

183
00:10:49,356 --> 00:10:51,358
Coffee for me.

184
00:10:54,987 --> 00:10:58,365
You know, Sherri, I'd really like
to see more of you.

185
00:10:58,574 --> 00:11:00,868
Maybe we should wait
and see how tonight goes.

186
00:11:01,076 --> 00:11:04,246
No, I mean, I've only got one good eye.
Could we change places?

187
00:11:05,122 --> 00:11:06,915
Oh, sure.

188
00:11:18,135 --> 00:11:21,055
- Are you okay?
- Oh, yes, yes. Fine.

189
00:11:21,263 --> 00:11:23,140
- This is a nice place.
- Yeah.

190
00:11:23,348 --> 00:11:24,641
It's my favorite.

191
00:11:25,392 --> 00:11:27,186
You ever come here with Charlie?

192
00:11:28,103 --> 00:11:29,688
I don't know. Probably.

193
00:11:31,148 --> 00:11:32,733
He's a big steak-eater.

194
00:11:34,109 --> 00:11:38,572
I'm more of a fish guy.
You know, I'm surf, he's turf.

195
00:11:40,324 --> 00:11:42,493
And we're cops.

196
00:11:44,244 --> 00:11:46,872
- You're very cute.
- You too.

197
00:11:48,457 --> 00:11:50,751
All right.
So tell me about yourself.

198
00:11:51,335 --> 00:11:54,213
Well, there's not a lot to tell.

199
00:11:54,379 --> 00:11:56,882
I was San Fernando Valley
Chiropractor of the Year...

200
00:11:57,049 --> 00:11:58,759
if you follow that kind of thing.

201
00:11:58,967 --> 00:12:00,427
Recently divorced.

202
00:12:00,636 --> 00:12:04,848
But not too recently. I've already had
my rebound, transitional relationships.

203
00:12:05,015 --> 00:12:07,100
- So no worries there.
- Good to know.

204
00:12:07,309 --> 00:12:09,561
Actually, it wasn't so much
a relationship...

205
00:12:09,728 --> 00:12:14,274
as a case of mistaken identity,
but I think it still counts.

206
00:12:14,817 --> 00:12:16,652
- Okay.
- And...

207
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:20,072
as you know, I live with Charlie...

208
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:22,115
whom you've already...

209
00:12:23,033 --> 00:12:25,202
- Met?
- Yeah, let's go with met.

210
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:29,373
Alan, is my having dated Charlie
gonna be a problem for you?

211
00:12:29,581 --> 00:12:34,253
No, no, no. A little.

212
00:12:35,003 --> 00:12:37,714
Okay, look. Charlie and l...

213
00:12:37,881 --> 00:12:41,176
We had a very brief,
superficial relationship.

214
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:43,679
Okay? And to be honest,
it was mostly about sex.

215
00:12:44,513 --> 00:12:45,931
Great.

216
00:12:46,848 --> 00:12:50,727
My point is, yeah, I'm tired of those,
those shallow relationships...

217
00:12:50,894 --> 00:12:52,980
I was having with guys like Charlie.

218
00:12:53,146 --> 00:12:56,900
I wanna be with a man who can be
sensitive and caring, nurturing.

219
00:12:57,067 --> 00:13:00,779
You know, somebody who can
make me laugh, make me think.

220
00:13:02,573 --> 00:13:04,908
You do realize I'm straight, right?

221
00:13:06,451 --> 00:13:09,621
- See, you really are adorable.
- Thank you.

222
00:13:09,788 --> 00:13:12,291
I tend to bring out
the mothering instinct in women.

223
00:13:12,499 --> 00:13:15,168
- Oh, really?
- Ironically, not my mother.

224
00:13:42,362 --> 00:13:43,697
What the hell are you doing?

225
00:13:43,905 --> 00:13:46,783
Check it out. Ninja death toast.

226
00:13:49,036 --> 00:13:50,746
Okay, stop it, stop it.

227
00:13:50,954 --> 00:13:53,290
You're in no position
to give orders, Mr. Harper.

228
00:13:57,252 --> 00:13:59,796
- Morning.
- Morning.

229
00:13:59,963 --> 00:14:03,884
- Death toast?
- Oh, thank you.

230
00:14:05,510 --> 00:14:09,222
- So how did it go last night?
- Fine.

231
00:14:09,431 --> 00:14:10,766
That's it? Fine?

232
00:14:10,974 --> 00:14:14,644
Charlie, we're not in high school
anymore. I'm not gonna go into detail.

233
00:14:14,853 --> 00:14:18,315
- Okay, don't tell me.
- Jake, go watch TV.

234
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:22,986
- I'm still hungry.
- There's bread all over the living room.

235
00:14:23,570 --> 00:14:24,905
All right.

236
00:14:26,073 --> 00:14:27,449
- Well?
- It went great.

237
00:14:27,616 --> 00:14:30,952
She said I'm adorable. She thinks I'm
nurturing, caring and sensitive.

238
00:14:31,119 --> 00:14:34,873
- I'm exactly what she's looking for.
- She's looking for a half-blind sheepdog?

239
00:14:35,749 --> 00:14:38,335
She invited me to her house
for dinner tonight.

240
00:14:38,502 --> 00:14:41,797
- I think she wants to have sex.
- With who?

241
00:14:42,005 --> 00:14:44,591
- With me.
- With you.

242
00:14:44,758 --> 00:14:45,926
Hang on a second.

243
00:14:50,097 --> 00:14:52,766
Nope. No snowballs reported in hell.

244
00:14:54,518 --> 00:14:56,812
No sightings of flying pigs.

245
00:14:57,312 --> 00:14:59,564
- What am I gonna do?
- You don't know?

246
00:14:59,731 --> 00:15:01,858
Come on, Alan,
you were married for 12 years.

247
00:15:02,067 --> 00:15:04,486
What does marriage
have to do with sex?

248
00:15:04,653 --> 00:15:07,364
Point taken.
Okay, you want some tips?

249
00:15:07,572 --> 00:15:10,200
No, no, nothing like that.

250
00:15:10,992 --> 00:15:13,203
I need step-by-step instructions.

251
00:15:13,703 --> 00:15:16,832
All right. Since this is your
first bout in this weight class...

252
00:15:16,998 --> 00:15:18,792
I'd say stick with the basics.

253
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,629
Better to do the simple stuff well
than the fancy stuff badly.

254
00:15:22,796 --> 00:15:25,298
Got it.
And the simple stuff would be...

255
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:29,135
Well, you know how women
like you to go slow?

256
00:15:29,344 --> 00:15:33,139
Really? My ex-wife put
a premium on brevity.

257
00:15:33,473 --> 00:15:36,685
Her motto was, " Less is more,
and none is perfect."

258
00:15:37,185 --> 00:15:40,272
Well, Sherri's not like that.
You're gonna wanna take your time.

259
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:43,316
- I can do that.
- But don't loiter either.

260
00:15:43,525 --> 00:15:46,945
You don't want her to get bored
and play solitaire on your head.

261
00:15:47,821 --> 00:15:49,906
No loitering. Got it.

262
00:15:52,951 --> 00:15:55,453
- Something else?
- Okay.

263
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:58,957
When you're with a woman like Sherri,
who's so gosh-darn beautiful...

264
00:15:59,124 --> 00:16:01,710
that you get excited
just thinking about her...

265
00:16:02,127 --> 00:16:06,923
how do you keep the sprinklers from
going off while you're still mowing?

266
00:16:09,426 --> 00:16:11,886
Let me make sure I understand.

267
00:16:12,345 --> 00:16:17,142
You wanna keep your toothpaste
in the tube until you're done brushing.

268
00:16:18,476 --> 00:16:20,186
What are you talking about?

269
00:16:20,770 --> 00:16:25,025
- What are you talking about?
- Okay, okay. Let me try again.

270
00:16:25,525 --> 00:16:30,530
I don't wanna frost the cake
while I'm still mixing the batter.

271
00:16:31,281 --> 00:16:33,700
I don't get it.
She must have lost a bet.

272
00:16:33,908 --> 00:16:36,244
- Excuse me?
- Nothing.

273
00:16:36,411 --> 00:16:39,789
All right. Here's what you do.

274
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:47,130
When you feel like the train
is leaving the station...

275
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:49,549
You mean, going in the tunnel?

276
00:16:49,758 --> 00:16:51,926
No, no, I mean leaving the station.

277
00:16:52,135 --> 00:16:55,013
But you have to leave the station
to get to the tunnel.

278
00:16:56,222 --> 00:16:58,391
Okay, okay.

279
00:16:58,558 --> 00:16:59,934
Let's start from the top.

280
00:17:00,101 --> 00:17:02,645
And work our way down, right?

281
00:17:06,024 --> 00:17:09,402
You know what?
Just shut up and listen.

282
00:17:10,153 --> 00:17:13,531
When you're making love,
the way to slow yourself down is...

283
00:17:13,698 --> 00:17:16,076
to think of something
completely non-sexual.

284
00:17:16,284 --> 00:17:19,579
- Well, what do you think of?
- You.

285
00:17:37,055 --> 00:17:39,724
That was a really great dinner.

286
00:17:40,767 --> 00:17:43,686
I'm glad you enjoyed it.
You ready for dessert?

287
00:17:43,895 --> 00:17:45,897
I've been ready since I was 14.

288
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:50,985
I'll be back.
Why don't you put some music on.

289
00:17:51,152 --> 00:17:52,821
Okay.

290
00:18:13,842 --> 00:18:16,302
Hey, how about Diana Krall?

291
00:18:16,511 --> 00:18:20,390
Oh, actually, that's your brother's CD.
Do you mind bringing it back to him?

292
00:18:20,765 --> 00:18:21,808
Not at all.

293
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:26,020
I think I have one of his T-shirts.
You might as well take that too.

294
00:18:26,187 --> 00:18:28,273
No problem.

295
00:18:28,481 --> 00:18:30,567
Hey, this is a cool, little CD player.

296
00:18:30,775 --> 00:18:34,112
Oh, thanks. It was a gift from your...
It was a gift.

297
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,614
Perfect.

298
00:18:36,823 --> 00:18:39,868
Is there anything else
Charlie left behind?

299
00:18:42,287 --> 00:18:43,830
Just me.

300
00:18:48,376 --> 00:18:49,836
My brother's a fool.

301
00:18:50,044 --> 00:18:52,213
No argument here.

302
00:18:54,757 --> 00:18:59,178
- That is a very effective negligée.
- Thank you.

303
00:18:59,345 --> 00:19:01,431
- Was it a gift?
- No.

304
00:19:01,598 --> 00:19:04,851
- As a matter of fact, I bought it myself.
- Oh, good.

305
00:19:06,936 --> 00:19:09,188
- How long ago?
- What?

306
00:19:09,397 --> 00:19:11,691
Well, I was just wondering
if Charlie saw it.

307
00:19:12,609 --> 00:19:14,402
Alan, don't go there.

308
00:19:15,028 --> 00:19:17,947
Oh, I wasn't going anywhere.
It's just that...

309
00:19:19,157 --> 00:19:22,535
- Nothing. More kissing.
- Okay, okay.

310
00:19:22,994 --> 00:19:26,122
What exactly is bothering you?

311
00:19:26,748 --> 00:19:29,709
Well, it's kind of hard to explain.

312
00:19:30,251 --> 00:19:33,838
For example, once,
when Charlie and I were at camp...

313
00:19:34,005 --> 00:19:37,675
I lost my swim trunks, and I had
to wear an old pair of Charlie's, and...

314
00:19:37,842 --> 00:19:40,386
I just couldn't enjoy
the pool at all.

315
00:19:42,388 --> 00:19:45,516
So, what are you saying?
I'm a pair of used swim trunks?

316
00:19:45,725 --> 00:19:49,687
No, no. In this case,
I think you would be the pool.

317
00:19:51,105 --> 00:19:52,523
Maybe this was a bad idea.

318
00:19:52,690 --> 00:19:55,026
No, no, it's a great idea.
It's right up there...

319
00:19:55,193 --> 00:19:58,696
with the wheel, fire and refrigerators
that give ice through the door.

320
00:19:58,905 --> 00:20:01,491
- Sorry. I don't wanna do this anymore.
- What? Why?

321
00:20:01,699 --> 00:20:05,703
You can't be with me without it being
some competition with your brother.

322
00:20:05,912 --> 00:20:07,705
It's not a competition.

323
00:20:07,872 --> 00:20:11,626
And even it was, shouldn't we do it
first before you decide who wins?

324
00:20:12,377 --> 00:20:13,711
You are unbelievable.

325
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:17,131
- That could be taken a couple of ways.
- Get out.

326
00:20:17,298 --> 00:20:20,176
Well, no ambiguity there.

327
00:20:21,094 --> 00:20:23,179
Don't forget your brother's CD.

328
00:20:23,638 --> 00:20:25,598
My eye!

329
00:20:33,205 --> 00:20:35,457
Man, I love sunsets.

330
00:20:35,624 --> 00:20:39,920
The way the sky is streaked with color.
It's amazing.

331
00:20:45,091 --> 00:20:48,428
It's the pollution that makes
those pretty colors, you know.

332
00:20:48,637 --> 00:20:53,934
What you're enjoying is the effect
of light passing through airborne poison.

333
00:20:56,561 --> 00:21:00,899
No, that's not
