Hold on, i'll check.

181
00:09:31,802 --> 00:09:33,673
- You hungry?
- What are we having?

182
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,719
I don't know.
Tell me if you're hungry.

183
00:09:35,806 --> 00:09:38,156
That depends on
what we're having.

184
00:09:38,243 --> 00:09:40,419
- Okay, what do you want?
- What do you got?

185
00:09:42,378 --> 00:09:43,858
He's not hungry.

186
00:09:46,251 --> 00:09:49,733
[whispering]
i thought you were taking her
home and coming right back.

187
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:51,343
You checked into a hotel?

188
00:09:53,302 --> 00:09:55,434
No, you're right.
Driving that way is dangerous.

189
00:09:57,697 --> 00:09:59,525
One pothole can change
your life forever.

190
00:10:03,268 --> 00:10:05,227
When was the last time
you ate something?

191
00:10:05,314 --> 00:10:07,620
Quit giggling,
you know what i mean.

192
00:10:11,537 --> 00:10:14,671
Okay, okay,
look in the honor bar

193
00:10:14,758 --> 00:10:16,716
For some gatorade
or something.

194
00:10:16,803 --> 00:10:18,414
Dehydration is the enemy.

195
00:10:20,329 --> 00:10:23,288
Alright, have fun.
I'll see you later.

196
00:10:23,375 --> 00:10:26,422
I amhungry.
What's for dinner?

197
00:10:26,509 --> 00:10:27,640
What do you want?

198
00:10:27,727 --> 00:10:28,946
What do you got?

199
00:10:30,905 --> 00:10:32,819
There's a couple
of steaks in the freezer.

200
00:10:32,907 --> 00:10:34,038
I want chicken.

201
00:10:36,475 --> 00:10:37,520
It's just wrong.

202
00:10:39,783 --> 00:10:41,437
So very, very wrong.

203
00:10:42,525 --> 00:10:45,615
♪ Ooh-Ooh men ♪

204
00:10:47,704 --> 00:10:50,011
- You full?
- Yeah.

205
00:10:50,098 --> 00:10:51,838
Good.

206
00:10:51,926 --> 00:10:54,754
Why, what else
we got?

207
00:10:54,841 --> 00:10:56,539
- You said you were full.
- I am.

208
00:10:56,626 --> 00:10:57,801
Good.

209
00:11:00,151 --> 00:11:02,023
But what else
we got?

210
00:11:04,199 --> 00:11:05,678
Sorry i'm late.

211
00:11:05,765 --> 00:11:10,161
Uh, i, uh, i had to go
to the office for an emergency

212
00:11:10,248 --> 00:11:12,076
And, uh, i got a flat tire.

213
00:11:12,163 --> 00:11:14,905
'uh, and so i had to wait
for the auto club'

214
00:11:14,992 --> 00:11:17,690
To come and change it
and i didn't have my card

215
00:11:17,777 --> 00:11:20,258
And the guy had to
check me on the computer

216
00:11:20,345 --> 00:11:23,131
Even though i've
been a member since 1989.

217
00:11:23,218 --> 00:11:29,224
And, uh, and that's why it took
till... Now for me to get back.

218
00:11:29,311 --> 00:11:31,052
Huh.

219
00:11:31,139 --> 00:11:32,749
I thought you
were here.

220
00:11:34,316 --> 00:11:37,014
- I missed you, alan.
- Thank you.

221
00:11:37,101 --> 00:11:39,756
Uh, can i speak
with you for a minute?

222
00:11:39,843 --> 00:11:42,628
Hey, uncle charlie,
what's for dessert?

223
00:11:42,715 --> 00:11:44,152
You said you were full.

224
00:11:44,239 --> 00:11:46,632
Not for dessert.

225
00:11:46,719 --> 00:11:49,896
- Okay, what do you want?
- What do you got?

226
00:11:49,984 --> 00:11:51,898
How do you not kill him?

227
00:11:54,684 --> 00:11:57,643
Charlie, i feel horrible
about what i'm doing.

228
00:11:57,730 --> 00:12:00,211
Then you're doing it wrong.

229
00:12:00,298 --> 00:12:03,519
No, i-I-I feel like
i'm abandoning my child.

230
00:12:03,606 --> 00:12:06,174
Weren't you listening? He didn't
even notice you were gone.

231
00:12:06,261 --> 00:12:08,002
That's not the point.

232
00:12:08,089 --> 00:12:12,093
What kind of a man chooses sex
with an insatiably hot stranger

233
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:14,269
Over quality time
with his little boy?

234
00:12:14,356 --> 00:12:17,011
I don't know, a man
who was married for 12 years

235
00:12:17,098 --> 00:12:18,838
And had sex 12 times.

236
00:12:21,145 --> 00:12:23,321
You're right,
i deserve this.

237
00:12:23,408 --> 00:12:26,411
Exactly.
So go enjoy yourself.

238
00:12:26,498 --> 00:12:28,674
I do have the room
the whole night.

239
00:12:28,761 --> 00:12:31,677
Most of your better hotels
prefer you do it that way.

240
00:12:31,764 --> 00:12:33,766
Make sure that jake
goes to bed early.

241
00:12:33,853 --> 00:12:36,595
- He's got karate tomorrow.
- Which you'll be back for.

242
00:12:36,682 --> 00:12:38,510
Charlie, trust me.

243
00:12:38,597 --> 00:12:39,903
You, i trust.

244
00:12:39,990 --> 00:12:41,818
It's him
i'm worried about.

245
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:47,258
[phone ringing]

246
00:12:52,742 --> 00:12:53,917
What?

247
00:12:55,788 --> 00:12:58,052
Oh, you've got to be kidding me.

248
00:12:58,139 --> 00:13:01,011
I have to take him to karate?

249
00:13:01,098 --> 00:13:04,493
Alan, it's 6:30
in the morning.

250
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:06,799
What kinda maniac
broad did you hook up with?

251
00:13:06,886 --> 00:13:08,279
She's incredible, charlie.

252
00:13:08,366 --> 00:13:09,976
I've never met anyone like her.

253
00:13:14,981 --> 00:13:16,287
Oop, gotta go.

254
00:13:23,729 --> 00:13:25,470
Jake, wake up.

255
00:13:28,299 --> 00:13:29,387
Well, i tried.

256
00:13:36,873 --> 00:13:39,093
Hey.

257
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:40,790
Anybody home?

258
00:13:40,877 --> 00:13:43,880
[charlie]
'right here.'

259
00:13:43,967 --> 00:13:45,751
Where's jake?

260
00:13:45,838 --> 00:13:47,144
I don't know.

261
00:13:47,231 --> 00:13:50,365
Didn't he have
a karate tournament?

262
00:13:50,452 --> 00:13:53,194
Yes. You were supposed
to take him three hours ago.

263
00:13:53,281 --> 00:13:55,587
Why didn't you take him?

264
00:13:55,674 --> 00:13:57,067
He wouldn't get up.

265
00:13:57,154 --> 00:14:00,636
I tried everything.

266
00:14:00,723 --> 00:14:02,986
- What time did he sleep?
- I don't know.

267
00:14:03,073 --> 00:14:07,077
I crashed around 2:00
and he was still going strong.

268
00:14:07,164 --> 00:14:08,992
He was up past 2:00?

269
00:14:09,079 --> 00:14:13,997
He said he's had coffee before
but that was a lie, right?

270
00:14:14,084 --> 00:14:15,651
Okay, okay, alright,
that's not important.

271
00:14:15,738 --> 00:14:17,218
The karate was
his mother's idea.

272
00:14:17,305 --> 00:14:20,786
Listen, i need to ask
you for another favor.

273
00:14:20,873 --> 00:14:24,486
Oh, come on. Put it
in the holster, wild bill.

274
00:14:27,489 --> 00:14:30,883
No, no, no.
This isn't about sex.

275
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:33,538
I need you to watch
jake for the weekend

276
00:14:33,625 --> 00:14:38,369
So that nancy and i
can go to vegas and get married.

277
00:14:38,456 --> 00:14:40,763
Oh, god, alan.

278
00:14:40,850 --> 00:14:42,852
There's no need
to marry the woman.

279
00:14:42,939 --> 00:14:46,072
If you don't want to have
sex anymore, just tell her.

280
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:48,771
No, no.
You don't understand.

281
00:14:48,858 --> 00:14:50,816
This is beyond sex.

282
00:14:50,903 --> 00:14:52,209
We're in love.

283
00:14:55,430 --> 00:14:56,431
Alan, come here.

284
00:14:57,954 --> 00:14:59,129
Ow!

285
00:15:02,045 --> 00:15:04,308
You are not in love,
you're besotted.

286
00:15:04,395 --> 00:15:08,182
No, no, no. I have never felt
like this about a woman before.

287
00:15:08,269 --> 00:15:11,097
We have a bond
that transcends the physical.

288
00:15:11,185 --> 00:15:12,403
Really?

289
00:15:12,490 --> 00:15:15,058
- Kind of a spiritual thing?
- Yes.

290
00:15:15,145 --> 00:15:18,061
- Okay, i can understand that.
- So where's she from?

291
00:15:18,148 --> 00:15:21,020
She's from around here.

292
00:15:21,107 --> 00:15:22,761
Where?

293
00:15:22,848 --> 00:15:24,023
Supermarket.

294
00:15:25,982 --> 00:15:27,723
Ow!

295
00:15:27,810 --> 00:15:29,333
Charlie, stop that!

296
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:30,943
I have thought this through

297
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:34,773
And i am really
and truly in love with..

298
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:37,907
- Nancy.
- I knew that! I knew that.

299
00:15:37,994 --> 00:15:41,084
I was looking for the proper
adjective to describe her.

300
00:15:41,171 --> 00:15:43,304
Nuts?

301
00:15:43,391 --> 00:15:44,435
Easy? Limber?

302
00:15:44,522 --> 00:15:46,220
Charlie!

303
00:15:46,307 --> 00:15:49,005
You started off on the wrong
foot with my first wife.

304
00:15:49,092 --> 00:15:52,051
Do not make the
same mistake with..

305
00:15:52,138 --> 00:15:55,141
Wonderful nancy.

306
00:15:55,229 --> 00:15:57,448
Okay, you're right.
This is not about her.

307
00:15:57,535 --> 00:15:58,710
Come here, sit down.

308
00:15:58,797 --> 00:16:00,538
You going to hit me?

309
00:16:00,625 --> 00:16:02,497
Well, let's see how it goes.

310
00:16:06,152 --> 00:16:09,243
Okay, look, i've never been
much of a big brother to you.

311
00:16:09,330 --> 00:16:11,549
Didn't protect you from bullies,
wasn't there when you

312
00:16:11,636 --> 00:16:14,030
Started dating or when you
got married and had jake.

313
00:16:14,117 --> 00:16:15,510
And you know why?

314
00:16:15,597 --> 00:16:17,555
- Why?
- I was busy getting laid.

315
00:16:20,341 --> 00:16:23,300
Which makes me the perfect
big brother to help you now.

316
00:16:23,387 --> 00:16:26,738
I've done this. I know what it
means to confuse sex with love.

317
00:16:26,825 --> 00:16:29,263
- That's not what i'm doing.
- We're not talking about you!

318
00:16:29,350 --> 00:16:33,702
We're talking about me and i've
been down this road many times.

319
00:16:33,789 --> 00:16:35,486
I remember this one girl.

320
00:16:35,573 --> 00:16:38,054
We had this unbelievably
hot weekend together.

321
00:16:38,141 --> 00:16:40,404
It was like nothing
i had ever experienced before

322
00:16:40,491 --> 00:16:43,189
And i proposed.
I begged her to marry me.

323
00:16:43,277 --> 00:16:44,756
Wow. Where'd you meet?

324
00:16:44,843 --> 00:16:47,977
Detention.

325
00:16:48,064 --> 00:16:49,283
This was in high school?

326
00:16:49,370 --> 00:16:51,197
Eighth grade.

327
00:16:51,285 --> 00:16:54,766
Years later, it happened again
with a different woman.

328
00:16:54,853 --> 00:16:57,029
Instant chemistry.
The sex was unbelievable.

329
00:16:57,116 --> 00:16:59,858
Thought we were soul mates
so i threw myself at her.

330
00:16:59,945 --> 00:17:03,166
I did everything to get her
to marry me. And you know what?

331
00:17:03,253 --> 00:17:06,387
If she'd said yes, i'd now
have a 67-Year-Old ex-Wife

332
00:17:06,474 --> 00:17:08,214
On a belly dancer's pension.

333
00:17:10,913 --> 00:17:12,828
So, what i'm trying to say

334
00:17:12,915 --> 00:17:15,657
Is you're not the first guy to
mistake passion for love.

335
00:17:15,744 --> 00:17:17,267
And you won't be the last.

336
00:17:17,354 --> 00:17:19,922
If someone had told me
what i'm telling you now

337
00:17:20,009 --> 00:17:21,924
I could've saved myself
a lot of heartache.

338
00:17:24,318 --> 00:17:26,624
Okay, i hear you.

339
00:17:26,711 --> 00:17:28,104
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

340
00:17:29,845 --> 00:17:32,587
So... Make sure jake doesn't
fill up on junk food

341
00:17:32,674 --> 00:17:35,067
And i'll call you
from circus-Circus.

342
00:17:36,895 --> 00:17:38,288
Circus-Circus?

343
00:17:38,375 --> 00:17:40,290
You're right.
Money should be no object.

344
00:17:40,377 --> 00:17:43,554
What's the hotel
with the pirate show?

345
00:17:43,641 --> 00:17:46,557
I'm sorry, alan, but i'm gonna
have to knock you out.

346
00:17:46,644 --> 00:17:48,777
- Hello?
- Mom, thank god you're here.

347
00:17:48,864 --> 00:17:51,432
Oh, i don't need
your sarcasm, charlie.

348
00:17:51,519 --> 00:17:53,434
No, i mean it.
I need you.

349
00:17:53,521 --> 00:17:55,697
- Alan needs you.
- What's going on?

350
00:17:55,784 --> 00:17:58,439
Alan, tell mom your plans
for the weekend.

351
00:17:58,526 --> 00:17:59,657
No.

352
00:17:59,744 --> 00:18:01,355
- Why? Embarrassed?
- No.

353
00:18:01,442 --> 00:18:02,617
- Ashamed?
- No.

354
00:18:02,704 --> 00:18:05,489
- Scared?
- Yes.

355
00:18:05,576 --> 00:18:06,795
Sweetheart, i'm your mother.

356
00:18:06,882 --> 00:18:09,537
You can tell me anything.

357
00:18:09,624 --> 00:18:11,669
Okay. Um..

358
00:18:11,756 --> 00:18:14,193
I met a wonderful
woman in the supermarket

359
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:18,459
A few days ago and
we're getting married.

360
00:18:18,546 --> 00:18:20,548
I see.

361
00:18:20,635 --> 00:18:22,941
Ow!

362
00:18:23,028 --> 00:18:27,381
For god's sake, if you're that
horny, find a nice call girl

363
00:18:27,468 --> 00:18:30,340
Put her on retainer.

364
00:18:30,427 --> 00:18:33,169
- This is not about sex.
- Oh, please!

365
00:18:33,256 --> 00:18:35,867
- What else could it be?
- It could be love.

366
00:18:35,954 --> 00:18:36,999
Yeah, sure.

367
00:18:38,783 --> 00:18:40,959
Uh, who is this woman?
What does she do?

368
00:18:41,917 --> 00:18:42,961
She does alan.

369
00:18:47,009 --> 00:18:49,359
Okay, okay, that
is how it started.

370
00:18:49,446 --> 00:18:53,102
In the last day and a half it
has blossomed into so much more.

371
00:18:53,189 --> 00:18:57,585
Oh, my randy little
nincompoop.

372
00:18:57,672 --> 00:19:01,153
Listen, if i had gotten
married after every weekend

373
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:04,113
Of hot sweaty debauchery
with a virtual stranger

374
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:07,595
You'd have... Well,
many more stepfathers

375
00:19:07,682 --> 00:19:09,248
Than you already have.

376
00:19:09,335 --> 00:19:12,338
She knows what
she's talking about, alan.

377
00:19:12,426 --> 00:19:15,167
Mom's been on more hotel
pillows than a chocolate mint.

378
00:19:22,436 --> 00:19:24,655
Don't help me, charlie.

379
00:19:24,742 --> 00:19:28,093
Now, now, listen, sweetheart,
sweetheart, no offense

380
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:32,315
But since you're dirt-Poor
and living with your brother

381
00:19:32,402 --> 00:19:36,885
One must ask, what kind of woman
would agree to marry you

382
00:19:36,972 --> 00:19:40,454
Unless she's a little slow
or looking for a green card?

383
00:19:43,152 --> 00:19:44,980
Listen to your mommy, alan.

384
00:19:45,067 --> 00:19:48,462
No. No, i am gonna
listen to my heart.

385
00:19:48,549 --> 00:19:50,725
For your information,
she hasn't agreed to marry me.

386
00:19:50,812 --> 00:19:52,422
I haven't even
asked her yet.

387
00:19:52,509 --> 00:19:54,772
- But you're planning to?
- Yes.

388
00:19:54,859 --> 00:19:57,209
I'm not going to hit you,
darling.

389
00:19:57,296 --> 00:19:58,297
Charlie?

390
00:19:58,384 --> 00:19:59,516
Ow!

00:20:00,996 --> 00:20:02,214

Yeah, sure. Sure. Bye.

402
